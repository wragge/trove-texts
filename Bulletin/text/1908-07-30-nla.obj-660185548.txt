The Tin Wreath
The polling by Australasian bards for
the best Australasian bard has been dis-
appointingly small; and in accordance
with an announcement recently made
that unless the poll was fairly representa-
tive, the election would be declared void,
the Tin Wreath will be handed over,
only in a metaphorical way, and in sec-
tions. For the curious result of this
limited balloting has been that the Aus-
tralasian Poet Laureate is two in-
dividuals. However, as one of the two
is disqualified as a candidate, owing to
his position as recording-officer, the
winner is hereby declared to be Roderic
Quinn. The total number of ballot-
papers received was only 29, and, as ; each
voter had six votes, the total votes num-
ber 174. It is obvious that this ballot
is too small to be in any yvay representa-
tive ; and the Tin Wreath is reluctantly
and reverently placed back once more on
its rusty nail, over the editor’s waste-
paper tank. At some future date it is
possible that the metallic halo will be put
up for auction again—on a more repre-
sentative franchise.
W
The position of the candidates was as
follows:
Votes.
Roderic Quinn ... 31
Arthur H. Adams ... ... ... 31
Henry Lawson ... ... ... 27
Mabel Forrest ... .., ... 12
Hugh McCrae 11
Grant Hervey 7
Bernard O’Dowd 6
Mary Gilmore ... ... ... 4
The following candidates scored three
votes apiece :
Brennan, H. M. Green, Hebblethwaite,
Henty, J. L. Kelly, W. Lawson, Louise
Mack, Paterson, “ Priam,” A. Sard.
The following got two votes each :
Bedford, Brereton, C. G. Colles, F. David-
son, J. Dailey.
The following secured one vote per
bard :
“Ande,” Brady, “Gilrooney,” Dorothy
McCrae, Ogilvie.
Taking the first choice of the voters,
Lawson and Quinn each received five first
votes, Adams four, McCrae three, Hervey
two, and the following, one : Brennan,
M. Forrest, H. M. Green, Hebblethwaite,
Henty, J. L. Kelly, Louise Mack, O’Dowd,
“ Priam,” A. Sard.
vt/
The question as to the best poem ever
written by an Australasian furnished some
interesting selections ; but the only poem
that received two votes was Tom Bracken’s
“ Not Understood.” Three poems of H.
Lawson received mention : “ Faces in the
Street,” “ The Star of Australasia,” and
“ Sweeney”; two of O’Dowd’s, “Athena”
and his sonnet Australia ” ; while the
following poems were selected once:
“ Remembrance ” (“ Priam ”), “ Poetse et
Reges ” (H. McCrae), “Where the Dead
Men Lie ” (Boake), “ The Sleepers ”
(Louise Mack), “The General Lover”
(G. Hervey), “ The Pathway of the Sun ”
(“ Steele Grey ”), “ Convict Once ” (Brun-
ton Stephens), “ The Rubaiyat of Aus-
tralia ” (F. Davidson), “ The Rubaiyat of
Australia ” (M. Brook), “ The Man from
Snowy River” (A. Paterson), “The Aus-
tralian” (A. .Adams), “September in
Australia ” (Kendall), “ Bannerman of
the Dandenong ” (Alice Werner).
Concerning America’s Markham
A thousand thanks for pricking the over-
blown and insufferable cult of Markham —
the man who took 15 years to produce The
Man With the Hoe. Your reprinting his
“ Crown of Character ” does the trick.
Heavens ! what stuff it is ! Listen :
. . . . “ The dust
That once was Nineveh, that once was pride;
Sinful watering-down of that splendid line—
The glory that was Greece, the grandeur that
was Rome.
Next—
And where is Rameses, the king of kings ?
Where, indeed ? Cribbed from Shelley’s
My name is Ozymandias, king of kings ;
Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair !
Again borrowed also from Shelley (Adondis):
He has gone down to nothingness and night.
And what price the silly “ dateless Nile ” in
the next line ? Does Markham refer to the
fruit or the age of “immemorial Nile?”
Again—
Jamshyd—name of splendor—where is he?
In Fitzgerald’s metrical version of Omar
Khayyam, Mister Markham !
They say the lion and the lizard keep
The Courts where Jamshyd gloried and drank
deep.
And this piratical Yankee poetaster even
levies On Stephen Phillips !.
Whose palaces did pulse with precious stones,
His dream in marble and his brag in brass.
What is that but a. miserable travesty of
“ Herod’s ” fine soliloquy—
And I will think in gold and dream in silver,
Imagine in marble, and in bronze conceive ?
And then the allusion—
There is one crown, one only, never flung
Back to the dust by his [Death’s] fastidious
hand.
Markham has read his Drayton to some pur-
pose—
Death lays his ioy hand on kings,
Sceptre and crown
Must tumble down.
And the straining after effect, the trite
and tripey “imagery”—the faulty scansion
—“ Ramgses ” for “ RamSsgs,” for instance
—and, lastly, the cool and deliberate com-
mandeering from the giants of Poetry.
Markham cribs sublime ideas and applies to
them the right butterwoman’s touch—and
the result is the “Crown of Character”!
Even I, 200 odd miles from the poets and
dictionaries, and with my memory alone to
rely on, can detect and denounce the fraud.
What Markham wants is a course of ‘ * Para-
dise Lost ” and “ Ulysses,” and then to be
left another 15 years on a desert island with-
out even a year-book. He might then give
us another decent bit of blank (as dis-
tinguished from blanky) verse. Let me elpse
with a just appreciation of the “ Crown of
Character”:
Hark to the blanky Yankee bard, bv Gosh !
Ay ! mark him, Markham, as he idly blows
Homer and all the poets through his nose
In one unending nasal piracy—
Phoebus, that they should dub him horn of thee l,
“ Poet and bard” —that any should applaud
(Let alone most intemperately laud)
Such utter balderdash, such futile rot,
Such puerile piffle and bathetic bosh,
By Gosh !
O. C. CABOT.
Apophthegms from Nietzsche
In the mountains the shortest path is
from peak to peak, but for that route one
must have long legs. Apophthegms should
be peaks, and those spoken to .should be
big and tall.
I would only believe in a God that knew
how to dance.
There are the terrible ones who carry
about in themselves the beast of prey, and
have no choice except lusts or self-laceration.
And even their lusts are self-laceration.
I know the hatred and envy of your hearts.
Ye are not great enough not to know of
hatred and envy. Then be great enough not
to be ashamed of them !
Ye say it is the good cause which sancti-
fieth even war; I say unto you, it is the
good war which sanctifieth every cause.
War and courage have done more great
things than charity. Not your sympathy,
but your bravery, hath hitherto saved the
victims.
Man is something that is to be sur-
mounted.
Because thou art gentle and of upright
character, thou sayest, “ Blameless are they
for their dwarfed existence.” But their
circumscribed souls think, “Blamable is
all great^existence.”
One ought still to honor the enemy in
one’s friend. Canst thou approach close to
thy friend without encroaching on him ?
Let thy sympathy be a divining ; to know
first if thy friend wanteth sympathy. Per-
haps he loveth in thee the unmoved eye and
the look of eternity.
Even God hath His hell : it is His love for
man.
Oh, just look at those tabernacles which
those priests have built for themselves !
Churches they call their sweet-smelling
caves.
And only when the clear sky looketh again
through ruined roofs, and down on grass and
red poppies on ruined walls, will I again
turn my heart to the seats of this God.
Ye want still to be paid, ye virtuous ones!
Ye want reward for virtue, and heaven for
earth, and eternity for your to-day ?
Art thou one entitled to escape from a
yoke ? Many a one hath cast away his final
worth when he has cast away his servitude.
Only where there are graves are there
resurrections. ,
Terily, I have often laughed at the weak-
lings, who think themselves good because
they have crippled claws !
All gods are poet-symbolisations, poefc-
sophistications !
The earth hath a skin ; and this skin hath
diseases. One of these diseases, for example,
is called “ man.”
To redeem the past ones, and to transform
every “It was” into “Thus would. I have
it ” —that only do I call redemption.
Thus speaketh justice to me: “Men are
not equal.”
And neither shall they become so !
On a thousand bridges and piers shall they
throng to the future, and always more war
and inequality should there be amongst
them
Good and evil, and rich and poor, and
high and low, and all names of valuations :
weapons shall they be, and sounding signs,
that life hath again and again to surmount
itself ;
And because it requireth elevation, there-
fore doth it require steps and variance of
steps and uprisers.
Awake and hearken, ye lonesome ones !
From the future come winds witlx stealthy
pinions, and to fine ears are good tidings
proclaimed.
Ye lonesome ones of to-day, ye retiring
ones, ye shall one day be a people : out of
you who have chosen yourselves shall a
chosen people arise, and out of it the super-
man.
Dead are all the gods : now do we desire
the superman to live.

rich Nietzsche, the first two parts of which
remarkable work are now obtainable at one
shilling each (T. Common, 8 Whitehouse
Terrace, Gorstorphine, Edinburgh). The

With sad heart dreaming dross of gold that

I veil my ardor with a mute persistence ;
Thinking “ the image that thy sad soul cherisheth
May wane to darkness and the purple distance.”
And thy fair presence, and thy glimmering white-
ness. •

But draw my soul’s strings <with a tensile tightness
Back to the gloom transfixed by woe, and

So fare thee Well, my shore-sweet loot,
We’ve got the word to go,:
We’re off to Sydney Town (per boot)
And bound for Callao—

We’ll make the road and take the road—
The road to Adelaide !

YOUR HUMBLE SURF ANT.
Where star-fish creep and quiver,
Where the jellyfishes shiver,
And bathing is permissible,
Amid tne foamy sea :
There’s a maiden white and dripping
Swimming blithely ’mid the shipping,
A mermaid extra-kissable,
All clean and washed, for me.
She’s mixed of idlenesses,
Soft eyes and wind-blown tresses,
Where bathing-spots are rushable
Beside the surfy brim ;
Oh ! who would live the land-life,
When he can get a sand-wife,
A something extra-crushable—
To walk about with him ?
W. M. W HXTNXY.
WHY?
Why do I love you? Your questions they
smother one !
Why do I love you ? Weigh Heavens and
Tophets!
Why do I love you ? Oh, ask me another one !
Who founded the firm known as Robertson

Why do I love you ? On frame of hibiscus
All strung with rose-tendrils my answer I’ll harp
it:
I love you because of your dear woolly whiskers
And sweet clumsy footsteps that trip on the carpet!

Fadzines.
The FadzinC, which is the latest craze in
the magazine line, hails from America. It is
nothing less than a specific type of magazine
dominated entirely by a particular style, of
fiction. Usually it takes the form of a
monthly publication that contains from five
to seven short stories, and sells at five
cents. These little magazines are all
well printed, and aim to give their readers
interesting fiction of the fad type. No
illustrations are permitted, the object of the
publishers being to spend their money on
buying first-class matter and presenting it
in attractive form. The Black Gat (Boston,
U.S.A.) was really the pioneer of
this school. It was started nearly eleven
years ago, and is still flourishing. It makes
a specialty of publishing strange and weird
stories of the kind classed as being ‘ ‘ power-
ful.” It makes a practice of paying very
generous rates for fiction, and cares not a
farthing for the name of the author. With
it the story is the thing. In 1904 it conducted
a famous short-story contest, and caused quite
a stir in the literary world by giving £420 for a
short story running to 3500 wo'rds, entitled,
“ A Few Bars in the Key of G.” It has in a"
number of instances paid over £2OO for the
rights of a short story. There are many
people in the world who want fiction only,
and for these The Black Gat caters. It
gives good measure without the usual
unnecessary illustrations, and the pur-
chaser gets -only what he wants in cheap,
handy form. If he were to buy an ordinary
Yankee magazine for the sake of the fiction
he’d get lib. of ads., |lb. of article apropos
Lincoln or some other Yankee god, |lb. of
illustrations, and |oz. of short story—price 15
cents. Hence the popularity of the fadzine.
Many imitators of The Black Gat have
sprung up suddenly, and died ditto. Two
have, however, flourished, and are still going
strong. The Grey Goose, which sheds its
quills in New York, and The Blue Mule,
which kicks in San Francisco. The latter is
all “fad,” being printed on blue paper with
blue ink of a different shade. The effect is de-
cidedly novel. Like The Black Gat, both
these publications pay good rates for fiction
and are always on the look-out for new
writers.
A remarkable publication that well deserves
honorable mention in the fad class is The
Little Devil, “Being the Yiews of One,”
which makes the atmosphere blue in the
vicinity of Los Angeles, Cal., once a month.
One man is responsible for the whole of the
contents. It describes itself as “ A fascicle
of apostolic asseverations, and other saintly
sayings, for everybody but mental mendi-
cants and moral runts.” Satire is its chief
weapon, and, like the proverbial Irishman,
it’s “agin” everything, including the
“givermint.” But it’s an amusing and re-
freshing little cuss, nevertheless.
JOHN PATRICK.
Poetry ? It seems like talking on tiptoe ;
like animals in cages; always going to one
end and back again . . . and making the
same noise when they get at the end —like
the bears.— G. Meredith.

BODY BECAME SO DENUDED OF FLESH
THAT CLOTHES HUNG LIKE A SACK.
Clements Tonic
*' LIFTED ME FROM THAT SORRY STATE.”
Mr. V. BOR WICK, Storekeeper, of 286 and 288 Crown Road,
Ultimo, relates his COMPLETE CURE to a Sydney reporter.
“ It is six years ago now since I got all right
again," Mr. Borwick .remarked, and I think it
was about up to me to have a change of luck, con-
sidering that I had been suffering for fully three
years. The pains that ran along my gums and
reached up to the top of my head were something
terrible, and half my time I did not know what I
was doing. My adversities set in when I was
running the plank,” as they call it, on a boat
discharging blue metal, and I can assure you that
I was so broken down in health that I had to put
another man on to do my work about every other
week, lalk about neuralgia. lam sure nobody
could have it worse than I had, and as I found
such a grand cure for it, the least I can do is to let
humanity know all about it, for I daresay my ex-
perience will prove very helpful. Well, out of all
the medicines I tried to cure neuralgia, the only
one that was of any lasting benefit was Clements
Tonic, and when I say that after keeping going
with that remedy for a few weeks the fearful
pains all left me, and have never returned all these
years, it is the honest truth I am telling you.”
‘‘ Is that the only ailment you have had ?”
“Indeed, no. All the time the neuralgia tor-
tures were at me I had other troubles to deal
with, for my digestion was just as bad as it could
be. Both from want of appetite, and also owing
to the pains about my jaws, eating was almost out
of the question ; but what was still more unfortu-
nate was the fact that the little I did force myself
to take to keep body and soul together had the
unhappy habit of disagreeing with me. And you
must remember that I was getting no sleep.
Neither night nor day—for weeks at a stretch
sometimes—could I get any rest, and, as you may
well imagine, the result was disastrous. I got so
terribly weak that ultimately I had to give up my
work altogether, and my body was so denuded of
flesh that my clothes hung about me like a sack.
Indeed, I was just going to have some of them
altered about the time that I started on Clements
Tonic, and by some means or other the idea was
shelved for a while, for which I was afterwards
very glad, as in a few months I was as stout as
ever. Yes; it was quite a matter for regula#
comment how well I was looking, and, thank
God, I felt well, too. For three years
previous to using Clements Tonic I was nothing
but a total wreck, for every part of my body
was adversely affected in some way or other. It
was my first experience of indigestion, and I sin-
cerely trust it will be my last, for I would rather
be dead and out of the world altogether than go
through such misery again. I got to feel as snaky
and uncomfortable as if everything in my
inside was going to pieces, and was so disturbed
and unsettled mentally that tjie least thing made
me irritable. My eyes always felt heavy and
swollen to such an extent that I could scarcely see
to read, and I felt so discontented and restless
that I could not stay indoors. Consequently, I
often wandered about outside, hardly knowing
what to do with myself, feeling as though death
would be a thousand times more welcome than the
wretched life I was leading, for I was in agony
everywhere. The pains in my chest were really
cruel, and I thought I had strained myself or
broken something between my shoulders owing to
the pain that was there. It was like getting hold
of a piece of meat, and tearing it in two —that was
the kind of feeling I had between the shoulders,
and my loins ached badly into the bargain.”
“ And have you never had a return of anv of
those symptoms during the past six years ? ”
“No; upon my honor; and I have not had
that nasty bulged-out feeling in the stomach
either after eating my food. No, Clements Tonic
removed everything, even to the bitter taste of a
morning, and the fur that used to cover my
tongue, besides which it gave me permanent
relief from the many attacks of giddiness that I
had previously been subjected to. How much my
nerves accounted for the misery I had endured is
hard to say definitely, but they undoubtedly had
their fair share of responsibility, for I must tell
you that I was so highly nervous that I could not
stand the least excitement without getting all of
a tremble, and I had also contracted an uncon-
trollable practice of measuring the future with
nothing but trouble and worry in. store. All I
could see before me was a continuance of my suf-
fering, only to be added to my misfortunes of
other descriptions, and now that you understand
the gloomy frame of mind I was in, you will
readily conceive why I speak so highly of Clements
Tonic for lifting me from the sorry state to the
happy and healthy condition I am now blessed
with. ’
STATUTORY DECLARATION.

“SCOTT’S Emulsion has put new
life into my son Sydney, aged 13. He
has always suffered with his throat and
chest, but since taking SCOTT’S his
cough has entirely gone, he has been
quite free from nasty chills, and looks
bright and
well
1 had no difficulty in getting him to
take SCOTT S and he is now quite
fond of it.” (Mrs.) M. GRANT,
Merriman Street, Millers Point, Sydney, N.S.W.
21/9/07.
Above is the Proof in the Facts.
Here is Proof in the Reason Why:
SCOTT S Emulsion is so agreeable that
young people and all delicate palates quickly
grow very fond of it, and at the same time
T S Emulsion has been proved by
actual experiment (conducted by medical
men) to be three times more curative, bulk
lor bulk, than the plain oil. This is the
result of two causes :
The finest quality Lofoten cod liver
oil, of which SCOTT’S is always made.
2. The original perfected SCOTT
process which makes this finest oil perfectly
digestible and pleasant.
No other emulsion possesses these advan-
tages and this is why no other emulsion can
cure throat and chest weakness either so
surely or so fast as SCOTT’S. Therefore,

The Beautiful Melbourne Tram.
This is a simple song of speed, of the four-a-shilling
spin,
Of the languorous Melbourne tram, indeed, and
the people that ride therein ;
Of the car that goes when the cable goes, and
stops when the works break down ;
Of the things you say when the ill wind blows,
two dry miles out of town.
Ihe Melbourne pull-cart’s slow and sure, and it
never runs off the track,
And the old horse-chariots still endure in the
suburbs that lie Out-back;
And the public does not cuss
Though the state of things is thus ;
And there are no flies on the enterprise of the
lords of the cable-’bus.
The Melbourne car is a car of ease, and it travels
on splendid springs,
As the Melbourne bloke in the bar agrees when
he babbles of trams and things.
“Yes, lam a Melbourne man,” says he, “and I
ride in a Melbourne car ;
I seldom care for the train, you see, though it
travels so fast and far ;
I like soft seats, and I like my ease, yet I tram it
every day;
There s nothing at all like a Melbourne car for
passing the hours away.
A lingering ride, and a share
Of the air on the front seat there—
The dummy in front is the place you hunt if you’re
looking for stacks of air ! ”
Though we are a clever and brainy lot in a number
of useful ways,
We break right up, those days we spot the Yoo
South dame who says,
“A pen’north, please!”—when the door goes
Slam, and the puncher says, “I am
A Melbourne tram-conductor, ma’am, and this is
a Melbourne tram,
And the fare is thruppencC.” Here we smile, and
the tram rolls onward, slow,
In a slumbrous progress, mile on mile, and we
doze and drowse as we go;
And the goggle-eyed public lamb,
Like a kid in a German pram.,
He loves his speed that is run to seed—he’s proud
of his snaily tram !

The Lure of the “Lob.”
In the springtime, when the young man
Lightly turns to prawns and stout,
And the parks are white with muslin
In the moonlight strewn about,
Sober merchants, city fathers,
Wobble through suburban ways,
Bearing parcels wrapped in paper,
Victims of the lobster craze.
Why, 0 why, does man in liquor
Spend his few remaining bob
With the dark, mysterious Dago
In the purchase of “ da lob ” ?
Wherefore does young Binks, the deriding,
Staggering home at half-past four,
Seek with claws and other fragments
For the keyhole in the door?
What strange charm, oh weird crustacean
Lurks beneath your crimson coat
That our ardor to possess you
Makes us miss the midnight boat ? '
What vile law of necromancy
Causes such insatiate greed
In the male and maudlin fancy
On your fibrous flesh to feed ?
We have vivid recollections
When the baby came to stay,
How we homeward bore in triumph
“ Lob ” to celebrate the day.
Called upon to view the infant,
And extol his varied charms,
How we fell weeping,
With a crayfish in our arms.
We have vowed against the lobster,
Now three dreary years at least;
But that shellfish still recurreth
Like the spectre at the feast.
And it seems that in the adage,
Truth will ever brightly shine ;
For it “must have been the lobster;
It could not have been the wine.”

HORACE HALLORAN.
The Indian Summer.
Oh, halcyon time,
In soft autumnal days.
When to Australian clime
The Indian summer strays,
And garbs the longing earth with green anew,
And paints the far-off ranges misty blue.'
No flower is stirred,
Nor trills there any song,
But the grey-plumaged bird
Flits silently along;
The sea fowl on the placid waters brood.
And all around is sylvan quietude.
The gods are just,
Who, e’er our weary feet
Moulder in kindred dust,
Dole out a potion sweet,
And hold the golden chalice to our lips

THE LAND REFORM OF SWINBURNE
AND ADOLPHUS BENT.
After many speeches, many threats, and many
delays, the Government of Adolphus Bent and
gas-man Swinburne has announced its new land
policy. The fact that great land monopolies are
eating the soul out of Victoria has been obvious
for so long that the need for a new land policy
requires no argument. But it is a very faint
little policy that Adolphus Bent and gas-man
Swinburne have put forth, and as the dreadful
House of Rich Landlords will almost certainly
throw out an apologetic little scheme with just as
much fury as it would a radical and comprehen-
sive one, it is difficult to see what they gain by
being mild and apologetic. What they lose is
obvious enough. If they pledged themselves
to a scheme which was calculated to r puse
the enthusiasm of a people long trodden
under the hoof of the great land monopoly
they would thereby purchase much popu-
larity, and if they were prepared to make the
reiection of their measure a cause of battle,
they might, with the people behind them, start a
crusade against the Upper House which would
make that institution totter on its base. Most of
this popularity will be sacrificed, for the \ aluation
of Land Bill 'isn’t calculated to arouse any very
wild enthusiasm. In the interests of Victoria
alone that is a pity ; yet in the interests of Aus-
tralia at large it is eminently satisfactory. The
half-heartedness of Adolphus and the gas-man is
the Australian Parliament’s opportunity. It is
good that the land monopoly curse should be
attacked by the Australian Parliament, because
the Australian Parliament is an institution
elected wholly by the people, and with that
basis to rest upon it is likely to do
the work far more effectively than the
most radical of State Parliaments. Also it will
do the work, not for one State, but for all the
Commonwealth ; and the revenue to be derived
from the graduated land-tax will then go into the
Federal Treasury ; and the fact of the land mono-
poly evil being dealt with by the Australian Par-
liament will strengthen that institution, and enlarge
its powers, and carry it another long step on the
road to Unification and Reconstruction —the two
great reforms which will blot all the State Upper
Houses, whether nominee or property-elected, off
the face of the earth. It would be an actual
disaster if the Government of Adolphus Bent
introduced a sweeping measure of land reform
just now, and if the Victorian House of Landlords
became less of an arrogant fool than usual
and passed the measure. For then Victoria,
which, along with Tasmania, has the big landlord
curse in its worst form, would sink into selfish
contentment. It wouldn’t give its support heart
and soul to the coming Federal Graduated Land-
Tax Bill, and for want of its support the Bill
might fail. That would leave other States still
in the grip of land monopoly, and prevent a valu-
able extension of the Federal power, and give
State Rights and State Upper Houses a longer
lease of life. Therefore, the fact that Adolphus
and his gas-man have produced a half-hearted
measure is good ; and the fact that the Victorian
House of Landlords will probably cut its own
foolish throat by rejecting the measure is good also.
* * • *
The intention of Bent and Swinburne is that
there shall be an official valuation of all Victorian
lands. .On that it is proposed that local rates,
probate and succession duties and such-like im-
posts shall be based. If the Valuer-General
thinks that the assessment court has fixed too low
a value he may give the owner the alternative of
having the figure raised, or of allowing the State
to resume his land at the value which it proposes as
a fair thing. If the owner thinks the valuation
too high, and doesn’t want to pay rates thereon,
he can demand that the State shall either buy his
property at its own high estimate, or else reduce
the estimate. Two things are likely to happen if
the Bill passes. First, the landlord will pay local
rates on something more like the fair value of his
land instead of on about a quarter of its value as
at present; but as local rates are not graduated
according to the size of the property, this won’t
necessarily tend to the cutting up of big estates,
and moreover the landlord, in his capacity
as a shire councillor, will simply reduce
the rates to make up for the increased valua-
tion. Secondly, provided the Valuer-General
doesn’t compromise with the landlord when there
is a dispute, and provided the Government uses
such small occasional rights of purchase as the
Bill gives it, the measure will, at very long inter-
vals, make a bit of land available for closer settle-
ment. But it will be made available, as a rule,
at the same artificial and wildly exorbitant
prices which now prevail. And for want
of a graduated-tax to keep the land sub-
divided after it has been subdivided there is
nothing to prevent big estates forming again, even
as they formed in the past, and then the old curse
will resume business at the old address.
* * * *
When the Valuation of Land Bill is put forward
as the best that the State Government can do, in
the State where the inducement to do something
dreadful and revolutionary is at its strongest,
every democrat must realise that there is no
remedy save a Federal graduated land-tax which
will be so steep at the top end as to make the
holding of big estates in arable country
quite impossible. The greedy landowner, who
will neither sell nor lease his land, or who will only
sell at impossible prices or lease at impossible
rents, has made Victoria, with its miserable popu-
lation of 14 people to the square mile, and
Tasmania with only seven people to the square
mile, overcrowded lands. From these overcrowded
lands the farmers’ sons, being shoved over the
edge by the boot of circumstances, are emigrating
wholesale in search of soil to cultivate. Yet
Germany, with 285 people to the square mile, has
not only room but also a wild craving for
immigrants, simply because it has almost
entirely got rid of its big landlord. Victoria has
now been sending its people away continuously for
16 years, and in that time it has sent away fully
100,000 more people than it has received. These
figures show a dreadfully diseased condition of the
body politic. Manufactures have grown steadily
under the influence of Protection, and the towns
have progressed; but in the richest part of the
country districts, where the great estates are,
population has been declining for nearly 30
years. The most fertile sections of Victoria,
under the influence of the great landlord, can
upport with difficulty a community of hardly
anybody to the square mile. To the great
landlord is owing the fact that Victoria’s
population is almost stationary ; that the young
men and women are leaving while the old remain
behind ; that the railways pay badly—no railway
can pay well when the trains wander through an
empty wilderness of grass; that the effort to
make ends meet under impossible circumstances
has led to neglect of the lines, to disrepair, sweat-
ing and murderous accidents ; and that Victoria
begins to wear the aspect of an old, played-out
land from which the glory has departed. Yet,
when the accursed land-grabber is shifted, even in
a small degree, there is an immediate resurrection,
as is instanced at Willaura, in the Vic. Western
District, where the cutting-up of one or two
estates created a prosperous town and multi-
plied the revenue at the local railway station by
twelve. The great landlord is a public enemy,
an individual who wilfully endeavors to ruin the
country, and to keep it empty and defenceless,
and consequently to weaken the empire to which
it belongs—all for the gratification of his own
miserable vanity. In short, he is the great
national leprosy, and deserves just as much con-
sideration as any other disease.
* * * *
Australia has no real need of an immigration
policy just now. It will require one when the
Northern Territory is thrown open, and it will
require one when its loclted-up lands are thrown
open ; but at present it has no more use for such
a thing than a blind asylum has for a telescope.
About 250,000 people come to Australia every
year • the great trouble is that about 230,000 of
them’see little here that is worth staying for, and
drift away again. While there are 400 frantic
applicants for 30 farms, as happened recently in
N S.W., there is nothing to induce the agricul-
turist to come this way, or to remain if he does
happen to come; and in empty Tasmania and
empty Victoria the Government, as & rule, by
reason of the great landlord, hasn’t one farm to
offer the 400 applicants, let alone 30. Australia, in
fact, has to choose between its landlord and its
national existence. No country can be adequately
defended by a population of 14 people to the
square mile, and the only Australian State which
has got to that figure has discovered that under
the big landlord regime it is actually overcrowded,
and its chief export these days is young men and
women. The question arises : Is the great land-
lord an adequate compensation for national
suicide? Australia has seen him as a legis-
lator, and as a citizen, and in other capacities. It
finds him often marvellously ignorant, super-
cilious, brutally selfish, a shamefully dishonest
dodger of his taxes, a lying thief whose promise
to pay his irrigation rates is of less value than a
Hindu’s oath, an advocate (usually) of Freetrade,
an opponent (as a rule) of Australian indus-
try, an advocate (in a very large number of
cases) of the wholesale introduction into Australia
of the scum of Asia, and (in many notorious cases)
an immoral loafer; also in almost every case a non-
producer, whose net value to the country is barely
equal to that of the sundowner or Murrumbidgee
whaler. These are not hovel discoveries. Almost
every country has had the great landlord disease at
some period in its history, and has made exactly
the same discoveries.
* * * *
So the news that the greatest public evil in
Australia is to be attacked in its special strong-
hold with a Valuation Bill is not calculated to
arouse enthusiasm. But the measure has great
value in a negative sort of way. It is evidence of
the hopelessness of expecting the resurrection of
Australia to come from State Governments and
State Upper Houses, from Adolphus Bent
and gas-man Swinburne, They have been
nerving themselves for this effort for
a long while. They have spoken witli passionate
intensity about the need for doing great things.
They have more cause to attempt great things
than the rulers of any other Australian State, for
the condition of the best parts of Victoria under
the curse of the big estates is a disgrace to
civilisation. And the best they propose is that
an occasional estate may (or may not) be
thrown open at the same famine prices as
heretofore, and that the aggregation of great
properties shall go on just the same as of
old. That is apparently the measure of State
effort in the matter, and, having sized it up, the
Australian Parliament has no longer any excuse
for hesitation. This country is in danger—great
and constant danger. An empty land with
neither army nor navy of its own always is. It
wants strong agricultural settlers to garrison it,
and. to get them it must have available land—not
30 farms to offer to 400 or 600 or 1000 applicants.
A massive graduated land-tax, that would set all the
overgrown arable estates at work cutting themselves
up, would start a gigantic system of settlement,
and the business would go on by its own volition
while the Australian Parliament was attending
to other affairs. The hand-made variety of
settlement, whereby a Government laboriously
acquires one estate, and cuts it up, and makes
roads through it, and at the end of a year’s hard
labor gets 50 new families on the soil, while in the
same time probably 100 farms elsewhere have
been absorbed into adjacent estates, is of no use
to a community which has so many dangers on its
horizon and so much cause for haste. It requires
machine-made settlement—the kind whereby the
land monopolist sets to work with curses, and
cuts up, and makes roads through, and sells his
own huge holding, and does it without a tired
Government keeping its eye on him all the time,
and does it everywhere ; and it also requires that
the same law which made the estate automati-
cally cut itself up shall also automatically keep it
cut up. All these things a sufficiently heavy and
sufficiently rigid graduated land-tax will do, but
the Valuation Bill of Adolphus and the gas-man
hardly even pretends to do any of them.
Strike Episodes.
By a man who escaped arrest: —
Sydney’s threatened tram strike broke loose between
9 and 10 a.m. Friday morning, just a day after the S. M.
Herald had solemnly assured the service that, no matter
what it might do, the wheels would continue to go round.
On Thursday night the ballot of the men off duty
had resulted - in favor of stopping work by 1420 votes to
32, and the hour fixed for the cessation of work was noon
on Friday. People swarmed into the city to get
their shopping done in time to be home again
by noon, and the cars were unusually crowded.
Then Superintendent Kneeshaw, with a view to
having the streets clear for the steam trams that were
to replace the electric service, ordered all drivers to have
their cars in the sheds by 11 a.m. The Strike Committee
determined to anticipate the hour and leave the cars in
the streets. It was, from the standpoint of the
Committee, good tactics. It would compel the Com-
missioners to show their hands by bringing out
the alleged reserve of drivers to clear the streets,
and would prevent the men being persuaded or
intimidated, as was possible if they returned to the depdt
in single crews. So members of the Committee met the
cars at the points nearest the Trades Hall, and gave the
order, “On with the hand-brake and down with the
pole ! ” By 10.5 traffic had ceased everywhere except on
the North Shore lines.
* * * *
Inspectors and foremen were sent out to bring in the
deserted trams, the strikers meanwhile standing by to
prevent evilly-disposed persons tampering with them, or
removing the brakes and trying to drive them. How
necessary this was became evident when a hot-headed
crowd tried to release the brakes of some cars in George-
street for the purpose of letting them dash down Brick-
field Hill, to be wrecked at the bottom. The strikers hud
to actually fight to prevent this being done. The first in-
spector who took over a car from the strikers received
a rough handling by the crowd. He was bombarded. His
cheek was laid open, his eyebrow cut. The windows of
the car were smashed, the driving-pole rope was cut, and
the back brake jammed on hard. Finally the mob
surged over the car, knocking the inspector off it, and
while he was down some women tried to persuade him to
“ come out ” —with hatpins.
* * * *
Farther down George-street, opposite the railway
station, someone played fantastic tricks with the points.
Oar after car was derailed, till at last a tram, consisting
of two long open cars, was split with neatness and
despatch. One car was on one set of rails and the other
on another. The couplings broke, and the electric coils
from underneath gushed out, like the innards of a whale,
and squirmed across the street. This caused the officials
to give up the attempt to change the trams to the other
line, and they were brought back to Fort Macquarie
dep'dt under the reversing gear.
* * * *
Then it became apparent that the talk of a reserve of
drivers was pure bluff. If it ever existed, it had vanished
into thin air. Only ticket inspectors, foremen, and other
officers were available, and it was afternoon before the
streets were completely cleared, although as many as four
cars were linked up together. In the afternoon a feeble
attempt was made to get cars running to the more dis-
tant suburbs to which there was no railway communica-
tion • but it was soon abandoned. The steam
cars ’ were not brought out. To have done so
would have meant calling on railway engine men
to drive them, and as that might have meant
precipitating a railway strike, it was not tried.
In the afternoon six railway men were, it was reported,
ordered to do tram duty, and refusing, were dismissed
instanter. But as they were almost immediately re-
instated, the Commissioners had evidently caught a
glimpse of somebody’s teeth.
* * * *
Saturdav morning found a very ineffective service in-
stalled Mostly the cars were driven by inspectors and
whitehaired foremen. Policemen rode on the backs arid
fronts of the cars, and the rounded humps on their hind-
quarters told as plainly as words that they were armed
with the heavy night-service revolver. Apparently the
men offering for conductors’ positions were not a desir-
able lot, as “ loyal drivers ” were issuing the tickets on
the trains while inspectors drove. And, still more
curious, although there were so few cars on the roads, and
although the streets were crowded, the vehicles were com-
paratively empty. Either people were afraid to risk
travelling on the cars, in spite of police protection (a
bobby is no protection against an inexperienced driver),
or their sympathies were so strongly with the strikers
that they were boycotting the cars out of sympathy.
* * * *
The men who drove the cars appeared to dislike being
looked at. They wore shamefaced expressions when they
saw friends and acquaintances among the crowds. In
William-street a man who was proceeding home per boot
glanced at a tram that had just stopped, and then with a
sudden oath rushed across, jumped on the footboard, and
pulled a woman passenger out. A policeman jumped off
the back of the car and showed a disposition to interfere,
but was peremptorily told to mind his own business.
And the man led his wife off, speaking to her in a very
severe tone of voice all the while.
* * * *
The attack by the general public on the inspectors who
were sent to clear the streets came as a surprise to the
Department, which had expected that any demonstration
would be directed against “ the men who had held up the
service.” But as a matter of fact the only attacks on the
strikers were made when the Committee anticipated the
hour of cessation. Then a number of ladies who had paid
for two or more sections angrily demanded a refund of
their fares ; and in George-street one dowager tried “ to
shake it out ”of the unfortunate conductor. But like
Joseph of old he fled, leaving his raiment, in the shape of
a neckcloth, in her hand. She threw it on the ground,
and, alighting, waddled off into the gathering crowd. A
remarkable sight was that of the strikers trying to protect
the inspectors from the violence of the crowd, and sug-
gesting that persuasion was better than hatpins.
* * • *
The first smash occurred in William-street on Saturday
morning, when a car dashed into the tail of a spring-cart
delivering meat. The driver of the cart soared
through the air and solved the problem of aerial
flight in one act. As he landed on his feet
and hands he was more scared than hurt. The
cart and horse were overturned and the street
littered with Sunday’s meat. The women on the car —
most of the passengers on the blackleg trams are women
—squealed, while the men jumped over one another to
get out. Tramming it had disadvantages. The inspector-
drivers, being out of practice, jolted the cars horribly,
spilling the passengers over one another on hilly runs,
and bruising noses at odd corners very badly. In spite of
the presence of police on the cars, the conductors received
anything but courteous treatment from their passengers,
who made no secret of the fact that “loyalty” to
the Department was not a thing to be admired.
The new conductors did not call out the names
of the streets, and their finger-nails wore any-
thing but the tint and polish insisted upon by the
management in the piping times of peace. On the George-
street run the only thing to distinguish the conductor
from the passengers was the bag he wore. Most conductors
wore every appearance of the direst poverty, their clothes
being dirty, poor, and shabby. Their faces, on the other
hand, were liberally covered with a two-days’ stubble.
Some of them wore conductor’s coats several sizes
too small or large, and were minus collars or ties.
Some of them were mere youths, who appeared to have
been taken direct from the cleaning sheds. Altogether,
the Department’s first day at strike-breaking was a sorry
spectacle.

On Saturday night, Sydney Trades Hall was crowded,
every room being occupied by the executive of some union
or other discussing the question of a General Strike.
Premier Wade’s wild talk about “unconditional surren-
der ” had irritated the men of all unions ; and, as he was
evidently qualifying for a “ backbone,” there was evident
a fierce desire to see what it consisted of. Also, it was
an opportunity to test the alleged strength of the new
Industrial Disputes Act. During Sunday, some sort of
an intermittent service was maintained on all the lines,
but it came to a sudden end about 4 p.m., instead of at 6
o’clock, as advertised.

Some pretty yarns went round about Manager Knee-
SHAW. One was a weird tale to the effect that he took a
crowd of raw recruits down to the Bridge-street yard and
instructed them in the use of the controller, and after-
wards addressed them : “ Are we downhearted ?—No !
Are we going to be beat?—No ! Three cheers for the
Tramway Department: Hip, hip, hooray !" But it is
only a fairy tale.- Manager Kneeshaw doesn’t instruct
raw recruits, and if he did he couldn’t be got to cheer to
save his life. Writer, in the days of his youth, worked
under Manager Kneeshaw, and knew him for a grim,
machine-like man, but just withal. He was an en-
thusiast of the cold, unemotional type, and if he got
excited over this trouble, he has degenerated sadly.
On one occasion he dropped into a wayside station and,
in about ten minutes, dragged to light a £l5O swindle.
The stationmaster lost his head and, whipping out a re-
volver, said he might as well be dead as disgraced, and he
was not going to die alone. It was a lonely little station,
with the S.M.’s house a quarter of a mile away, a solitary
“ general store ” some 200yds. distant, and an empty goods
shed the only other building that broke the skyline.
Kneeshaw sat down, lit his pipe, and pointed out that if
the shortage was made up, or even nearly made up, there
would be no prosecution, and the man would still be able
to do something for his family. The railway wasn’t the
onlyemployer. AndtheniftheS.M. couldn’t see the force of
the argument, why, he had better shoot ; but for Heaven’s
sake let him be sure and kill himself thoroughly, as a
dead auditor was certainly a hanging matter. And then
the ruined officer put away his revolver and wept while
Kneeshaw vainly tried to comfort him with a cigar while
he went on with the audit. Somehow, writer doesn’t
think that is the sort of man who would go out and ask a
lot of blacklegs he was making use of to cheer.

Selection of a Capital by Office Boy.
The latest contribution to the Australian capital
site discussion comes from E. W. Owe’Sullivan,
M. and appears on the notice paper of the
N. Assembly as follows :
Mr. O’Sullivan to move
(t) That, in the opinion of this House, as Dalgety does
not seem to be acceptable to the people of New South
Wales as a site for a Federal Capital, and there is no
prospect of a satisfactory settlement of the question, it is
desirable that his Majesty the King should be invited to
give a definite decision on the matter.
(2) That, in order that he may arrive at a just decision,
his Majesty should he supplied with a copy of our Federal
Constitution, the report of the Premiers’ Conference in
Hobart, and all arguments for and against each locality
proposed as a site for the Federal Capital of Australia.
And The Bulletin desires to explain to the
Owe’S. that it is an amazingly illogical and un-
wise contribution for these reasons:—
(1) Nobody knows whether Dalgety is unacceptable to
the people of N.S.W. or not. There isn’t the slightest
reason to believe that it is. True, certain Sydney papers
say that it is, just as they say that Victoria is in a con-
stant conspiracy against N.S.W., and that N.S.W. has
been “robbed” by the other States, and that the
United States is going to take to Freetrade, and
just as they used to declare that N.S.W. wanted to
secede from the Commonwealth, and was alarmed at the
“ designs of Rome,” and that it would never be satisfied
till it got rid of Railway Commissioner Oliver and got
“a man like Johnson.” But that kind of press isn’t evi-
dence. And certain merchants and importers say
Dalgety is unacceptable to the people at large because
the trade of a capital on the Snowy River wouldn’t
pass through Sydney for their personal profit,
but their venal assurances are also not evi-
dence. And certain State politicians say the
same sort of thing because they wish to aggrandise the
State authority, which is themselves, and so they regard
a Federal capital which won’t be wholly dependent on
N.S.W. as a diminution of their pomp and importance.
They aren’t evidence either. But even the wildest
opponent of the Dalgety site hasn’t ventured to suggest
submitting all the proposed sites to the people of N.S.W.
to see which will get the most votes. Carruthers cer-
tainly proposed a faked State referendum by which
the Snowy River site was to be regarded as defeated un-
less it got more votes than all the other proposed sites put
together, but even with the cards stacked so outrageously
as that he was afraid to play the game for fear of losing.
If the people of N.S.W. object to the Dalgety site, where
are the meetings of protest and the public demonstrations,
and why do such good anti-Dalgetyites and enthusiastic
anti-Australians as Conroy and Pumpkin Smith and Lons-
dale get so warmly biffed out on election day ?
(2) The selection of a capital site lies with the people of
Australia, not with the people of N.S.W.
(3) The idea of referring the matter to a tired old King
who never saw any of the sites, and doesn’t know them
from a crow, and who would never look into the matter
at all, any more than Queen Victoria looked personally
into the selection of the Canadian capital, but would
hand the papers over with a yawn to a Chamberlain or
Gold-Stick-in-Waiting, who would probably tell a clerk to
go through them (and the clerk would most likely tell the
office boy to have a look at them) —well, it is an idea which
even beats the selection of the site of Sydney’s new rail-
way station.
As a side issue of the case, Owe’Sullivan pro-
poses that the King should be suppled with copies
of “ all arguments for and against each locality
proposed.” But who is to supply (or suppress)
the arguments ? As Owe’Sullivan propounds his
amazing suggestion to the N.S.W. Assembly, in-
stead of sending it to the Australian Parliament,
it seems just possible that he wants the N.S.W.
State Legislature to refer the matter to Ed. VII.
all on its little own, and to supply the arguments
—that is, to supply the arguments for Canberra
or Lyndhurst, and to carefully botch or muddle or
misrepresent the points in favor of the site chosen
by the Australian Parliament. The appearance
of the N.S.W. Assembly in the matter is humor-
ous—in fact, the idea that a mere State Legisla-
ture should solemnly discuss the reference of a
matter that is quite out of its jurisdiction, to a
potentate who is also quite out of its jurisdiction,
is about the most humorous feature of the Owe’-
Sullivan inspiration.

Some Words From Swinburne.
There was a gathering of farmers, under the
name of the Chamber of Agriculture, at Geelong
(Vic.), a few days ago; and Minister Swinburne
made an address to them before they began busi-
ness. Swinburne’s address soon drifted, natu-
rally, on to the burning land question. Said the
Minister :
There is no doubt but that the time is rapidly arriving
when a land policy which will break up the big estates
suitable for agriculture must be adopted. ... The large
owners must split up their estates, for the time is
rapidly arriving (again) when all the big squatters must
look to the large areas north of the Murray.. . . The
great owners must recognise that the policy of Victoria
is to split up the great estates.
As it is impossible to walk out of Geelong in any
direction —unless you walk into the ocean—with-
out tripping over large estates, Swinburne’s de-
claration was very apposite, and made some of the
audience shiver. Then the man who was once
suspected of being a good democrat went on to
draw lessons from the old countries: —
It is impossible for us to continue the English landlord
system. There ... the small laborer was frozen out and
converted into a hireling. But England is seeing her
mistake, and to-day they are passing a Bill for the com-
pulsory purchase of small holdings. . . . Read how the
Acts of Germany, which created a large army of land-
owners, are admired, as they are by almost the whole
civilised world. Read how they praise the Code Napo-
leon, which divided France into small lots and made it
the most productive country in the world.
Also, Swinburne dived into statistics, and pro-
duced a few very telling figures :
In Western Germany, 80 per cent, of the agricultural
laborers own their own freeholds. In Victoria, not more
than 5 per cent, occupy the same position !
Altogether, it was a striking speech ; and, coming
upon the Government’s declarations at the open-
ing of Parliament, it almost seemed to indicate
that something will be done. But with .the House
of Rich Landlords in the way, and with Bent’s
hopeless insincerity to be accounted with, it is
practically certain that there will be either no
State land legislation at all, or merely some small
sham instalment, not enough to do any good, but
just enough to give the Tories in the Australian
Parliament an excuse for saying : “ Let us not be
hasty ! Let us wait to see the effect of State
legislation.” And the chances are that a very
small and bogus instalment will satisfy Swin-
burne. Many people begin to regard Swinburne
these days as a lanky fraud.

The Plight of an Australian Art Gallery.
The appointment of Premier Wade as a trustee
of the National Art Gallery of N.S.W. was an-
nounced last week, and at this last straw local
art-lovers breathed stertorously through their
aggregate trunk or proboscis, and muttered more
things than may safely be said in the presence of
a bobby constable. J. H. Carruthers and F. B.
Suttor are other politicians on the trust, and
there are, further, a couple of K.Cs., an auc-
tioneer, a newspaper proprietor, several nonde-
scripts, and E. du Eaur. Arthur Collingridge
died recently, and Julian Ashton, feeling that
his position was hopeless, had resigned some
time before. And so this great gallery,
with all its potentialities for educational
good or evil, is left in the hands of a
number of citizens, estimable, for the most part,
in their different ways, but possessed of no more
knowledge of the fine art of picture-buying than
so many dairy farmers or haberdashers. The
personnel of the trustees’ body hasn’t varied much
in years. The pushing “person of influence” has
always predominated hugely over the artist. The
result is to be seen in the majority of the pictures
now in the Gallery. Let the N.S.W. connoisseur
compare the quality of them with those in the
Adelaide Gallery (a most worthy array), and he
will have good cause for grief. N.S.W. owns—
with a few bright exceptions—a “ dealer’s collec-
tion” pure and simple. Poynter’s “Queen of
Sheba ” is a good example of the bad art that is to
be found within the beautiful Domain building. It
is the sort of painting the uninformed buyer—the
well-to-do business or professional man, whose
crowded life has allowed him no time for serious
study outside his own line—rushes, with cheque-
book in hand, at each succeeding Academy or
Salon in the Cold Country. It is a fine, spacious
riot of color, with carefully-limned figures dotted
about—an accurate drawing, accurately colored.
But it doesn’t begin to be art. This picture is a
true type of the pot-boiling stuff the popular
painter grinds out year by year for his banking
account’s sake. The original fetches £lOOO or so
from a class of buyer who would not, of his own
initiative, pay half that sum for a Corot or a
Sargent. A dealer pays another £2OOO for
reproduction rights, and when that bit of business
has been fixed up the artist starts impassively
on another pot-boiling creation. He has not
turned a hair from the moment the idea of the
work came to him, to the day he banked the final
payment in connection with it. There is but one
kind of art achievement that lives—-that, namely,
into which the artist has put something of himself
—which reflects in a measure, to those with eyes
to see, his personality. The amateur cannot dis-
criminate for purchasing purposes in this regard.
Amongst so many pictures it were impossible that
all those in the Sydney Gallery should be bad.
(If one of the big Sydney drapery establishments
set Bernard HALLor Arthur Streeton to buy-
ing underwear, those amateur buyers of softgoods
would, in all likelihood, stumble on a good thing
here and there by accident.) But the tally of
notable works is lamentably small. It is grati-
fying to observe that among both the landscapes
and the portraits the paintings of Australian
artists compare favorably with the imported ones.
Streeton’s landscapes are as good as any in the
Gallery, and Lambert’s equine portrait is charged
with dignity and style. The two Longstaffs
(Henry Lawson and “The Lady in Black”) are
magnificent, and Lavery and Eox exhibit fine
paintings. In the water-color section, if Eripp’s
“ The Common ” be excepted, there is not one
distinguished work ; and for the etchings, take
away the Whistlers the Hellieus and a Erank
Short, and the rest are artless. N.S.W. has a
right to look for better results. It is spending a
big sum annually, and getting for it, mainly,
works which, a generation hence, will be as dead
as though they had never been. It is impossible
to expect that matters will be different so long as
citizens who are law, sheep and real-estate ex-
perts as a general thing, and art experts in their
spare time, administer the Art Gallery funds and
have the buying of the pictures. The body of
trustees clamors for reformation, for new blood —
and artistic blood at that.
The Sport of Suicide.
On Saturday, July 18, most of Melbourne’s lead-
ing people went to Caulfield for a pleasant day’s
racing. They got it. The meeting was a steeple-
chase one, and the following attractions were
provided during the afternoon :
(1) The mare Envoy (she had had no public practice as
a steeplechaser before the previous Wednesday, according
to Melbourne Argus) fell at the log fence, which is the
last obstacle of the famous Caulfield treble, and crushed
her rider, Hayiioe, to death, in full view of the good folk
on the grandstand. „ . ~ .
(2) Wickliffe hit hard and got rid of his rider, and
Evening Star came down in the same race. Evening Star
was subsequently destroyed. Both jockeys were hurt,
though “ not seriously.” , .
(3) Lochino came down. J. Ciievalley, the rider, was
conveyed to the casualty-room. . . „
(4) i>ba struck and got rid of his rider in the Hurdle
Race. ! 'p. Guinane, rider of Egba, was able to walk in.
(5) A couple of horses, Cross Step and Boldrewood, fell
at the home turn in the two-year-old event. Cross Step
was the first to come down, and Boldrewood fell oyer her.
E McDonald, rider of Cross Step, was badly kicked, and
the mare had her neck and jaw injured, and sustained
concussion. A. Bell, who rode Boldrewood, had his
forehead slightly cut and was somewhat badly shaken, so
ib was thought advisable to remove him to the Alfred
Hospital. «
It is an appalling tally of blood and slaughter.
The fact that it is by no means an abnormally
large one (the death or serious injury of jockeys is
a matter of course at all our big steeplechase
meetings) suggests the need for legislative inter-
ference with this insane sport. Steeplechasing is
supposed to be a necessity in every country “on
military grounds.” The main argument advanced
by those who approve the existing system is that
Australia, unlike the older countries, is fenced
with timber, and that its horses must therefore
know how to get over solid obstacles if they are to
be of use in war-time. At the best the contention
is a fallacious one. The average post-and-rail
fence up-country is breakable, as followers of
hounds well know. Log obstacles of the sort at
which Hayhoe met his death are about as frequent
as moas. But in any case steeplechasing as con-
ducted in the Commonwealth achieves nothing
in the way of getting a breed of jumpers
that would be serviceable for military pur-
poses. Most of the animals put to this branch
of racing are “cast” geldings, or mares which
have been pronounced worthless for flat-racing.
In other countries the steeplechase horse lasts.
He hasn’t to race over fences as immovable as so
many blocks of steel. If he makes a mistake, his
neck isn’t broken as a general thing, nor are his
legs so knocked about as to render his swift des-
truction an act of mercy. In Australia three or
four years is a long career for him. He is usually
dead or crippled before he has had time to become
expert in his calling, and he generally manages to
kill or cripple a jockey or two before passing out
himself. The steeplechase item serves no useful
purpose. Stripped of cant concerning its
benefit to the breed of the local horse,
etc., it is there solely and simply to give
a fillip of excitement to the afternoon’s enter-
tainment—to minister to the blood-lust of a
section of the crowd. The doubting suggestion of
the Melbourne coroner who held the inquest on
Hayhoe, jthat the course should be lengthened so
that horses might be taken at a slower pace, was
futile. The last few fences would be raced over
if the distance were 10 miles instead of three.
There are onlv two alternatives in the matter:
(1) To abolish the steeplechasing item from race-
programmes altogether ; (2) to replace the present
unbreakable fences with ones that are capable of
being brushed through or shattered. Apart from
the humanitarian side of the question, it should
be worth the while of the different State Parlia-
ments to see to this by way of effecting a saving of
valuable human life.
+.
Bent and Doomsday.
Premier Bent has just rolled into Vic. Parlia-
ment a Bill as flamboyant and rotund as its
sponsor, likewise as enthusiastic in its promises.
He calls it his Boole of Doomsday. In it he pro-
poses to appoint a Valuer-General —hereinafter
called the Boss Valuer—with assistant valuers,
to estimate the worth of all the land in
the State (1) as unimproved, and (2) as im-
proved. The measure is a trifle abstruse
in spots and involved in places, but the
idea seems to be to value the private and public
lands of the State on something like an honest
basis, after which the said valuation may be used
for municipal rating purposes, for assessing duties
under the Probate and other such Acts, for the
making of advances on mortgage by the Savings
Bank Commissioners, and for similar purposes
under the Transfer of Land and Stamps Acts,
etc. When the valuers have done their
work no revaluation may be made inside
two years; but if either the Boss Valuer
or the owner objects to the valuation, several
things may happen. In each district of the State
assessment courts are to be established, consisting
of aP.M. with two assessors, one appointed by the
Government, the other by the local municipal
council. From this Court there is no appeal
except on questions of law. If the Boss Valuer
dissents from this Court’s assessment, he may fix
his own value, and demand that the owner shall
accede thereto ; and if the owner objects, the Boss
Valuer may acquire the land for the State at that
price. Per contra, if the owner thinks the valua-
tion too high, he may demand its reduction to his
own figure, whereupon the Boss Valuer must
either accede to the demand or buy the land at the
owner’s price. If the owner of land cannot be
found, or is travelling abroad, it will be sufficient
to serve notices on the tenant. Should
there be no tenant, the papers may be
‘ put on some conspicuous part of such
and.” Where an owner cannot be discovered
it will be sufficient to merely call him
“ the owner,” without stating any name. Also,
where an owner is visible and tindable, there is no
need for personal service of notices—a registered
letter is sufficient. Capital improved value is to
mean the price the land would bring at the time
if sold on reasonable terms, clear of all encum-
brances ; the value of improvements is not to exceed
the value if they w T ere made at the time of valua-
tion ; the unimproved value is the price such land
mi"ht be expected to realise if sold unencumbered
on reasonable terms and as if no improvements
existed. Work done by the Crown or by a
council (irrigation works, etc.) are not to be
deducted from the improved value when assessing
the unimproved value. A valuer will be liable to
a penalty of £2O for every wilful error. Muni-
cipal councils may strike their rates on either
the improved or the unimproved value, as
they think fit; and, though there is a pro-
vision whereby 50 ratepayers in a shire or
100 in a city, town, or borough, may object to
the unimproved basis, and may demand a poll,
there is no provision for ratepayers who object to
the improved value method similarly getting an
expression of public opinion. Of course, the chief
point in the Bill is the provision by which the Boss
Valuer can acquire any land if he chooses to fix
the value high enough ; while the objecting land-
owner, who would like to value his land at about
a tenth of its real price, dare not do so lest the
Boss Valuer take him at his word and acquire his
paddocks at that figure. That is a provision
which the Fat Landlords may be relied upon to
jump on hard. It is an interesting Bill, in a
small way, and will, at any rate, come in handy
when the Australian Parliament sets to work to
get the lands of the Commonwealth honestly
valued, and imposes a land-tax thereon. There
will be no House of Fat to oppose that measure.
At odd times, quite a heap of comment has been
aroused in Victoria by the capers of the Bent
Government over the acceptance of tenders for
public works, but generally the allegations, though
violent, were vague, and often they had their glory
dimmed by the illuminating grandeur of Bent’s
explanations. In that particular, Adolphus has
shown a glibness that would disarm the strongest
critic ; and he now has a chance to be even more
than usually eloquent over a little deal with Johns
and Waygood, Ltd., ironfounders, of Melbourne.
Some time ago, the erection of a new diamond-drill
store was commenced at South Melbourne, and,
during the building operations, it was learnt that
the firm aforesaid was to supply the steel trusses
for the roof at the figure of £285. No one knew
why it had secured this part of the work, since
no tenders had been invited; but certain inter-
ested experts, on viewing the trusses, alleged that
the price was unspeakably gorgeous, and declared
that the work could have been carried out hand-
somely for £l5O and still left a profit.
Consequently, Melbourne Age and some few
ironfounders are asking about Johns and Way-
good, Ltd., and Bent’s Department of Public
Works has very lamely replied that that firm
was asked for a price (it was, apparently,
the only firm asked), and it suggested £285.
Apparently the principle of open tendering for
Government work has been cheekily ignored, and
people are the more interested when it is recalled
that Johns and Waygood Ltd. have been in the
past surprisingly successful in their tenders, and
when it is remembered that the chairman of the
concern is Thomas Adolphus Bent, and that if
Minister and gas-man Swinbubne isn’t a director
now, he certainly was one not so very long ago.
These are the reasons why further explanations
from Adolphus will be thankfully received.
When Labor-leader McGowen challenged the
Wade Ministry on the ground that its spoiled-
kid attitude towards the Commonwealth had
brought N.S.W. into public contempt, he might
have had the Premiership within his grasp. And
the reason why he hadn’t a ghost of a chance was
that noone believedin his sincerity worth a copper.
That is to say, he may have recognised as a
matter of reason and logic and common-sense that
the Wade-Carruthers attitude tovvards the
Commonwealth is unjust, petty, malicious, un-
patriotic and unmanly ; but in his own soul, as a
matter of instinct and prejudice—which often
amount to more than reason and logic—
McGowen is in the same camp as Wade.
He has no Australian enthusiasms, and the
Australian sentiment and ideal are not in him.
He believes himself a good Australian just as
Bruce Smith believes himself a vigorous and
almost reckless democrat, and with just as much
cause. A real Australian, with the case which
McGowen had, could have swept his audience off
its feet, and set Wade’s hair on fire by the heat
of his scorn. McGowen merely threw a small
lump of ice at his enemy, for it was the only thing
he had to throw. And then to support him there
rose up his lieutenant, Holman, an even smaller-
minded parochialist than Wade ; and Dacey, who
wailed in Wade’s own best style about imaginary
“Federal encroachments ” ; and the furious anti-
Federalist, Nielsen; and some members who
thought Australia and the Federation were of
such little importance that they hardly mentioned
them, and complained chiefly about Hospital
Saturday collections and such-like small deer.
The case was so hopeless, owing to the complete
lack of enthusiasm in most of the attacking party
(Griffith, M.L. A., was almost the only honest,
whole-souled Australian in the crowd) that it
would have been better left alone. It is no use
hitting a fortress with a wet dishcloth, and that
was about the size of what McGowen did.
♦— — - —
A well-known and highly-reliable citizen writes,
after a visit to Papua :
Judge Murray is a far better man than Papua has any
right to have—or Australia, for the matter of that, at her
present stage. You aren’t ready yet for a diplomat and
a ruler in one, which is the correct description of this
three-generations Australian (how did you grow him ?).
He is making this country, and, so far as I can judge,
could make three like it, with one hand tied behind him
and one eye shut. The whole of Papua is solidly in his
favor—violently so in a good many districts. The natives
are learning more respect for the Government than they
ever had before, and at the same time are turning to it
for protection whenever they are oppressed, either by
stray whites or by each other. The development of the
country is proceeding “ the way the Devil wint through
Athlone —in shtandin’ leps.” Papua has got a chance,
and may become a most valuable possession . . . “ Instead
of which,” as a certain judicial person once said, twelve
discharged Government servants and Bartonites, and
about six extremely prejudiced missionaries, are being
allowed to do their level best towards throwing Judge
Murray out. . .
This is literally and truly the whole opposition. It
works day and night, however, and sticks at nothing.
Month after month the malcontents contrive to put off
the final decision by bringing up one baseless charge after
another, setting up another ninepin in the place of every
one that is bowled over. There is not a grain of truth in
any of the charges they have brought against the
Administrator, and this is always proved, but, never-
theless, the Government lends a willing ear to the next
just the same, and it is now said the appointment will not
be made for two or three months at least.
If you can do anything to show the matter up, you will
have deserved well of your country. I should think you
might do a good deal; yours is the only paper in Aus-
tralia which talks—the rest merely bleat. Sheep is a good
thing; you’ve made your fortunes out of it, but you
don’t want to see it climbing out of the agricultural
pages into the editorials and the news, and sitting in the
managerial chair—which it does in pretty well all the
Australian papers.
In brief, the policy of the microscopic but mischievous
Opposition up here is the famous one of “Obstruct,
obstruct, obstruct.” It is the most effective policy there
is, and may win.

Britain has sacked its old Militia and Volunteers,
and now the Territorial Army which was to
replace them seems to be a bad failure. The
trouble arises through lack of the compulsory
training system. The employee who joins is at a
disadvantage as compared with other employees ;
he has to get leave of absence for training pur-
poses, and Brown and Jobson, his employers, are
apt to tell him at last that he had better stay
away altogether; they can get plenty of young
men who don’t disorganise the routine of the
softgoods department by wanting military leave.
And, on the other hand, if Brown and Jobson
always grant the required leave, then they pro-
bably get a lot of enthusiastic military men in
their service, and so much leave hampers the
business and puts the firm at a disadvantage in
its competition with the rival firm of Plug arid
Ferguson. The compulsory principle would pub
all employees and all employers on one footing,
and then the Territorial Army would boom. At
present there isn’t much of it save the name.
“ Vigilans” : After seeing pastoral Queensland I
don’t hesitate to say that the best country is Out
Beyond. There is no comparison between the
Barclay Tableland (N.T.), Georgina River and
Flinders districts, on the one hand, and places like
the Warrego, Maranoa, Ward and Dawson on the
other. In the former, Mitchell, Flinders and
other grasses thrive, while the herbage is O.K.
In the latter, the grasses are inferior, and when
dry are non-fattening. With railways the Table-
land of the Territory, the Georgina and Flinders
would carry 30,000,000 sheep, besides cattle and
horses. Water is obtained by boring in these
districts ; and a meat works in the centre of Aus-
tralia would help the country over any possible
drought. That railway would make a Winnipeg
or Chicago, and no mistake about it. But the
Barclay Tableland, with a lfiin. rainfall and the
finest grassed country in Australia, is now let to
companies in blocks of 10,000 square miles at
eighteenpence a square mile per annum. Bah !
The Lonely Lighthouse-Keeper.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Mauger. promised last night that when the
Commonwealth took over the lighthouses it would
improve the lot of the lonely lighthouse-keeper.—S. M.
Herald (21/7}08).
All day he watches as the ships
Surge up and pass away again ;
In fancy he sees laughing lips
Of folks on board ; their warm hand-grips
Meet his in loving phantom strain.
Sometimes the vessels come so near
He thinks he hears the watch-bells ring.
Eight strokes he counts at midday, clear
And regular—the clangings spear
His heart with sad remembering.
Liners sweep by in driving rain.
With spray-drenched masts in nodding line,
And he’s a passenger again ;
Snug under decks he laughs amain
And toasts the company with wine.
At night he has the steady gleam
Of port and masthead lights, whereby
To cheat his loneliness; they seem
Like kindly eyes, seen in a dream,
Bidding him take life merrily.
At length he does. He laughs aloud
And chatters to the silent beach.
Thoughts gay, bizarre upon him crowd
In-his tall home, white as a shroud,
Whose bright arms to the sky-line reach.
And now his friends, the passing ships,
Are quite forgotten. All that he
Once cared for from his mem’ry slips—
He and his lamps are in eclipse
In a dark lighthouse by the sea.

JOHNSON—HIS STRIKE.
When the crusade of the Sydney morning papers
led to the discharge of N.S.W. Chief Railway
Commissioner Oliver —the man who made the
double mistake of being an Australian and of dis-
approving of the free carriage of newspapers on
the railways—it was understood that the godlike
and imported Johnson who succeeded him was to
put everything right. Johnson became a sort of
fetich with the Sydney morning papers, and
with the S.M. Herald he became a lunacy.
Long before it saw him, or knew what he could
do—in fact, long before it personally knew
Johnson from a crow — the S.M. Herald
not only assured the public that Johnson
would put the railways right and put the tramways
straight, but that it only required “a man like Mr.
Johnson ” to put right the Lands Department,
and that if only a sufficient number of John-
sons could be found everything would be renewed
and brightened up and revived and made young
again. The Herald was drunk on Johnson in
those days. And now the imported tin god, by
reason of his superciliousness, his attitude as a
Superior Person, his lack of a simple sense of
justice, and his inability to manage men, has
blundered into a needless trouble, regarding the
size of which he probably hadn’t the slightest idea
when he rushed in with the large feet of authority
where angels fear to tread.
TV * * *
The thing above all others which is calculated
to arouse mutiny where a large body of men are
concerned is the suspicion of injustice. Johnson
apparently didn’t realise that. He fell in heavily
by reason of a lofty attitude and a shindy over
2d. The Sydney tram service maintains, among
other things, a few secret agents or spies. These
individuals go forth in the morning armed with a
certain amount of money, and are supposed to
ride on the tram-cars all day. They are also
supposed to preserve the tickets they buy and to
send them into the office, and along with each
ticket they send the number of the car on which it
was received and the number of the conductor from
whom it was purchased. There is a weak point
in the system, both as regards the conductors and
the spies. Some people throw down their tickets
in thecar, and if theconductor picks them up (which
he can only do with any semblance of safety when
the car is empty, and that doesn’t happen very
often), and sells them again (which he can only do
with reasonable security if they are fairly clean),
and escapes detection by the regular inspector
(which he would do very seldom if inspec-
tors were sufficiently numerous), he can retain the
price of these twice-sold tickets for beer or other
base purposes. But it is equally true that
if the departmental spy picks up a few tickets (and
in Sydney dozens of them can be picked up), and
sends them in as tickets he has bought, with the
number of a tram-car and a conductor on them
(any one can get these numbers by looking at the
car and the conductor as they stand at the
terminus), he also can retain the price of these
tickets to spend in beer or other sins. If he goes
out in the morning with 5s. to spend in tram
tickets, and returns 5s. worth of tram tickets in
the evening to account for the money, it is all the
same, so far as his accounts go, whether he bought
60 tickets or only bought 48 and picked up 12.
And he can swindle the Department with only a
fraction of the risk that attaches to the conductor.
If the conductor sells dirty or crumpled tickets he
arouses suspicion ; the spy can send in dirty and
crumpled tickets which he picked up, and
pass them off as tickets which he bought,
and the simple explanation is that they got
into a decayed state in his pockets. If the
conductor sells old, casual tickets which he
has picked up, a visit from an inspector is liable
to bowl him out at any moment, for the numbers
of the tickets held by passengers in the car must
show a certain consecutiveness and correspond
with the numbers in the officer’s ticket book ; the
spy, on the other hand, isn’t checked or audited
by any inspector. So the situation is that the
conductor can only defraud the Department at
considerable risk, while the spy can do so with
absolute impunity. Therefore, in a conflict of
evidence, the odds are always in favor of the con-
ductor. It can only be assumed that they are in
favor of the spy by taking it for granted (1) that
the Department naturally and habitually engages
bad characters as conductors ; and (2) that the
class of men who take to this kind of private
detective business are so little lower than the
angels that their mere word necessarily carries
weight far beyond the average.
It was apparently on these assumptions that
Johnson went recklessly into battle over 2d. A
couple of his agents returned two tickets as having
been sold to them by Conductor Croucher,
which tickets Conductor Croucher had no busi-
ness to sell. They were not in the lot issued to
him that day, and if he sold them the inference
was that he had been picking up used tickets and
re-selling them so that he might use the proceeds
for private rum or other degrading purposes. But
there seems to have been sufficient dubiousness
about the case to make a wiser man than Johnson
keep off the grass. In the first place, Croucher
was a man with six years’ clean record in the tram-
way service, while the spies or secret agents were
two raw young policenren who had formerly
been farm laborers, and about their previous
good characters not very much seems to have
been known. They weren’t two separate and
disinterested witnesses, for they lived together,
which gave them a fair opportunity to concoct
schemes for making a little money over and above
their wages if they desired to do so, and as already
explained, their opportunities for making an illicit
copper with impunity were far greater than
Croucher’s. There were certain small dis-
crepancies as to times and places in the tale they
related. Also, they couldn’t identify Croucher
by his face as the man who sold them the tickets.
And there was this striking difficulty about the
evidence: The tickets which they said they
bought from Croucher were from a book which
had been used the previous day by another con-
ductor on quite a different car. It is fairly easy
to imagine the dishonest conductor picking up for
re-sale tickets dropped in his own car. But it
isn’t easy to imagine a conductor—an officer
who is practically tied to his vehicle all day
long—getting off it to rush after another car
and pick up dropped tickets that he may
turn them into money. The detectives, who
aren’t tied to any special car, have a chance
to gather up tickets promiscuously, but in
Croucher’s case the theory seems full of difficul-
ties. And the coincidence by which the con-
ductor is said to have sold a dishonest ticket to
each of the detectives, seeing that they profess
to have got in at different points, is at least
remarkable.
* * * *
The accused conductor, after he was sacked by
the Department, had the usual two separate rights
of appeal—first to the Department in a different
form, and second to the Department again in still
another form. In each case he was thrown out.
Johnson’s department seems to have travelled
dully and woodenly on the theory that the official
spies must be right, despite any apparent dis-
crepancies and suspicions, simply because they
were the official spies. There was no right of
appeal to any independent legal authority
outside the Department; and the request for
a criminal prosecution, which would have
subjected the evidence against Croucher to
independent legal scrutiny, was refused. It is a
cold day when an accused person asks to be
arrested and can’t get himself arrested, yet that
was Croucher’s case. The fact that Commissioner
Johnson wouldn’t submit his evidence of alleged
dishonesty to a criminal court was one point
against him, and his half-offer that Croucher
would be re-employed, if he cared to apply after
six months’ absence from the service, suggested a
considerable lack of faith on Johnson’s part in
Johnson’s own case. Then the service boiled
over. Every man in it understood that he was
liable, at any moment, to be dismissed and branded
as a thief on the mere say-so of two possibly shady
characters who chose to attach his number to tickets
picked up anywhere, and to use the money thus
saved for liquid refreshment. Against the regular
inspector who boards a car, examines all tickets,
compares them with the conductor’s book, demands
an explanation of any discrepancy, and procures the
prompt suspension of the conductor if the expla-
nation is not fully satisfactory, there is no com-
plaint. He is an open and above-board auditor.
But against the murky secret agent, who isn’t ex-
pected to offer any evidence save his bare asser-
tion, there is no possibility of defence, and that
fact excites bitter resentment. If the same
method was applied in any ordinary court of law
the shout of the orthodox Fat Man about “un-
English methods of procedure ” would blow the
roof off the welkin. But the Johnson depart-
ment seems to have been incapable of realising
that a sense of gross and overbearing injustice
might urge a large body of men into revolt, even
though the immediate quarrel was only over one
man and 2d. In fact, Croucher’s alleged 2d. was
merely the final straw which broke the back of a
very tired camel. And, having gone into the
struggle, the necessity for winning was as urgent,
whether the ostensible cause was 2d. or £1,000,000.
When Britain started a war that raged over two
continents because of Jenkins’ story about
his ear, it presently realised that failure
would be just as disastrous in the War
of Jenkins’ Ear as in any other con-
flict. If Johnson’s arrogant folly and muddle-
ment over Croucher and the alleged 2d. chanced
to lead to a railroad strike, a wharf and shipping
strike, and a general convulsion, it is difficult to
see that Johnson has any reason to be surprised.
* * *
The daily press and the Tory section of the
community take up the lofty attitude that even if
Croucher was unjustly treated, “ discipline must
be maintained.” That theory is hardly worth
inquiring into. It would justify anything and
forbid resistance to anything. The fact remains
that discipline never is maintained very long
except when the men who are entrusted
with the maintenance of it are fit to hold
power and have sufficient sense to use it
in a way that inspires a fair amount of
confidence. Every despotism is tempered by
assassination, and every kind of absolute author-
ity is limited by the possibilities of revolt. There-
fore the more absolute the authority, the more
carefully does a wise man use it, and the less care-
fully is it used by the other kind of man—the
wooden-headed tyrant who thinks that because
his power is absolute on paper it is absolute
in reality. Ex-Commissioner Oliver steered
the N.S.W. railway and tramway services
for many years with excellent results and
maintained discipline without a hitch, yet in his
dealings with his subordinates he was never
accused of having sacrificed his dignity or the
dignity of his office. He had the art of driving
men without getting the team into confusion.
Johnson, without producing any better results,
seems to have an unfortunate capacity for getting
his team into wild insurrection, and for rushing
needlessly into places where he can neither
advance with profit nor retreat with satisfaction.
On present appearances JOHNSON is going to be a
costly investment.
The great, hunky, brawling John Foekest has
been shouting things at Perth out of the irre-
sponsible orifice above his waistcoat, and this
statement was his text: —
The Commonwealth would never be more than a name.
It was absurd to spend six millions on the Territory when
the Port Augusta-Kalgoorlie line was to be built. There
was three-and-a-half millions surplus revenue. The Bill
was unfortunate, and if not illegal it was unjustifiable.
Other States had derived special benefits. Queens-
land received a million in the sugar bonus. Vic-
toria got tariff protection for industries. New South
Wales would get the iron bonus, South Australia bene-
fited on her wine, and Westralia got nothing.
John Foreest was always the poorest kind of an
Australian. In fact, he never was any kind of an
Australian at all. He went into the Federal
movement for loot—parochial loot. He apparently
had a vague idea that the Commonwealth could
get money from somewhere apart from the people
of Australia —from Turkey or Arabia possibly—
and scatter it among the States, and Bigjohn
meant to bellow in the forefront of the
battle to get a double share for Westralia.
The impossible transaction didn’t come off,
and Bigjohn began to see visions and
huge financial snakes. A horrid idea is now in
his mind that somehow, though the tariff is the
same all over the Commonwealth, the other States
are protected while his unhappy spot isn’t. He
sees in his sleep a dark conspiracy by N.S. W. and
other States against Westralia, and feels that his
place has been “robbed.” In fact, Bigjohn has
got the State Frights disease very badly, and as
he roars even louder than T. Bent his shapeless
wrath can be heard a long way off. Possibly the
fearful person is really foolish enough to imagine
that Queensland “receives a million” in sugar
bonus, though for an ex-Treasurer such ignorance
is lamentable. Even the office-boy at the Trea-
sury should know better than that.

“Zira,” the second play in Miss Margaret
Anglin’s budget, put on at Her Majesty’s (Sydney)
on Saturday night, will not add much to anybody’s
reputation. “ The Thief ” wasn’t a pleasant rdle
for a leading lady, but at any rate the main idea
was striking and the treatment was unconven-
tional. “Zira,” on the other hand, is quite
commonplace in both respects.
Zira is a lady who starts life in much the
same way as Leah Kleschna did—with a father
who puts her in the way of learning many things
that she shouldn’t know. Finally she marries a
captain whom her father has been encouraging and,
incidentally, plundering, and then she finds out
that her captain is married already. Years later
—and the stage story starts here—father and
daughter meet in General Graham’s headquarters
in the S’African war. Hester Trent, busy burying
the past, is a nurse; her father, she finds, is a
guide on the British side. Just when they have
fixed it up to go to England and make a fresh
start, he is killed. At almost the same moment
Ruth Wilding is struck by a splinter from a shell,
and apparently killed. Ruth Wilding, whose
father has just been killed too, had confided to her
that she was on the way to England, to her un-
known aunt, Lady Constance Clavering. “Ah !
Why not ! ” says Zira—and then you know that
you have beenthrown into the old familiar melo-
dramatic gutter. As you go out to settle the
strike at the end of the first act, you pretty
well know all the rest. Zira will go to
London ; she will wind her arms of love
around Lady Constance Clavering; she
will be devotedly loved in return ; and then the
woman who was supposed to be killed in S’Africa
will turn up, and down will come all the house of
cards. You see that all the more clearly because
the first act introduces you to Sir Frederick
Knowles thinly disguising Sir Frederick Treves,
the King’s appendicitis surgeon, who announces
that the lady really isn’t dead, though she looks it.
The gutter of melodrama takes you along
just as you expected. But you cherish one hope.
Surely, to save it from the utterly commonplace,
they will spare you the scene in which the hero
(the Rev. Mr. Clavering) tells the lady that,
though her sins may have been as scarlet, yet
have they all been wiped out, and in her now
he sees only a pure, devoted woman wholly
necessary to his life and happiness. But no, not
even that does the gutter spare you —it carries
you on right to this banal last. You know then
that the lady will resist; that in her great love
(quite obvious to everybody but the young man
himself) she will refuse to prejudice his career;
that she will say at last that she is tried beyond
her strength, and that the curtain will fall upon
the couple in the embrace that tells the young
misses that the two are to live happily ever after.
The Bulletin really didn’t mind that so much in
the case of Miss Tittell Brune and Leah Kleschna,
because Miss Brune is a willing sacrifice offered
up to the dear girls of the community. But Miss
Anglin is worthy of better stuff.
* * * *
True, this last act to which the old gutter
leads us is unconventional in one respect at any
rate. As indicated above, it is mostly a love-
making scene. Young Clavering (Henry Kolker,
of course) is a frightfully good young man, who
has established a mission to clean up the kitchen,
and put a bit in the cupboard, and wipe the
children’s little noses by way of preparation for a
spiritual campaign. But Mr. Kolker makes him
a dreadfully sombre young man. He booms in
his deep bass from first to last. He has clearly
taken over the job of the historical person
who never smiled again. A frightful mess
he will make of the missionarying busi-
ness ; and The Bulletin isn’t a bit sur-
prised to hear, in the one specific ease
that he talks about, that his share in the
business has been a dead failure. How that sort
of man would make love The Bulletin doesn’t
know; but, as represented by Kolker, the pair
stand side on to the audience, nose to nose, and
continue in earnest conversation for the space of
about five minutes. And then she “accepts”
him. It is incredible. The piece and this in-
credible conclusion mar the enjoyment of the
charms of Miss Anglin’s delightfully natural
acting. Moreover, it gives her hardly any scope
for those lighter touches wherein she especially
excels. Miss Bessemer makes a first appearance
as the lady who wasn’t killed. She serves as the
villamess of the piece, doing the necessary damage
by her pitiless frigidity. It is a thankless part.
Miss vaughan (Lady Constance Clavering)
supplies in a thoroughly artistic fashion what
little of mirth the piece affords. George S.
Titheradge represents Sir Frederick Knowles —
oh, yes, and he too has a line that moved the first-
night house to its one good laugh. No trams were
running on account of the strike, and to the house
that had just either fought for a cab or done a
tramp, Sir Frederick explained, “Yes, you see,
I’ve been taking a ’bus-driver’s holiday ! ” It
doesn’t look much of a joke now it’s written ; but
the house roared. In its wisdom it evidently
reckoned that it had better roar while it had the
chance.
** * *
“Miss Hook of Holland,” which the
Clarke-Gunn-Meynell syndicate presented in an
alluring stage setting at Sydney Criterion on
Saturday night, suggests a Baris Revue with the
coarseness eliminated. There is just enough plot
to hang one or two feather-weight love-episodes
on, in conjunction with a mass of light fooling.
The music is dainty and tuneful, the comedians
really comic in spots, and there is enough color
glitter and attractive femininity to satisfy the
most exigent. But there outstands the delightful
Australian chorus-girl. How bright and natural
she is, and how understandingly she sings ! The
supply of her seems to be inexhaustible ; she is a
local product which doesn’t need a tariff in the least.
The Commonwealth has a glut of musical comedy
just now, yet each fresh show of the sort finds it
an easy matter to get together crowds of pretty
girls with voices, clever feet, a knowledge of
music, and brains. In “The Song of the
Orphans” and in “The Wonderful House that
Hook Built ” the girls are charming.
* * * *
Mr. Hook is supposed to be a Dutch
distiller. In reality he is G. P. Huntley, of
England, grown old. He has a pretty daughter,
by name Sally, who smacks no more of the
Netherlands than does Miss Ruth Lincoln, or any
other well-brought-up musical-comedy star from
London, W. Gathered about the Hooks, amid a
riot of canals and windmills, are British lovers,
British soldier men, British servants, British
grotesques, all of whom wear Dutch names and
Dutch clothes, but are about as suggestive of any
portion of Holland as they are of Bourke
(N.S.W.). Mr. Hook mislays a recipe, and its
meanderings constitute the plot of the piece.
* * * *
The fun which the modern Briton who
theatre-goes within a three-mile radius of Charing
Cross best loves, is in evidence throughout. It is
the humor that radiates from quaint futile mimes;
that resides in the saying of solemn oddities;
in the using of unusual yet startlingly apropos
phrases. Wit would be out of place in such a
galley, and it isn’t sought after. In its way this
essentially London brand of fun-making is vastly
entertaining. The main provider of it is Edwin
Brett, who plays Mr. Hook. This actor may have
a personality of his own ; at present it is
obscured by that of Huntley aforesaid, whose
wraith pervades every line of the part. But
it is a diverting and sprightly wraith, well
worth paying good money to view. William
Cromwell represents Simon Slinks, a loafer.
Slinks makes heroic play with the hoary
jest anent the toiler seeking work and in a constant
turmoil of fear lest he may find it. When he gets
away temporarily from the deadening influence of
that ancient quip, Slinks is distinctly amusing.
Miss Ruth Lincoln sings and acts well as Sally ;
in her waltz song she soars right out of the ruck
of comic opera stars. Roland Bottomley, Sally’s
bandmaster lover, owns a pleasant voice arid some
attractive numbers; but he has a tendency to
overact, which is exasperating. Even band-
masters have their reposeful moments. Arthur
Appleby, as Paap, Tom Payne (Schnapps), and
Mina (Emmeline Orford) are others deserving of
honorable mention.
m* * *
‘ * The Red Mill ” revolves steadily at
Sydney Royal, and the date when it will cease to
grind isn’t even mentioned. There have been
many Mills, including “The Mill on the Floss,”
Mill on Liberty, and the mills of God which grind
exceeding small; and among the crowd it isn’t
exactly easy to place the present Mill. But any-
how it takes a high position for mirth, and its
Dutch setting is picturesque, and the reflection of
the sun on the canals of the Netherlands is a
beautiful circumstance with eels in it.

A FLOOD OF JONES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The concurrence of religion, philosophy and art was an
indication of the fact that they had come nearer the
heart of reality. All three were one, because they were
all witnesses of the same fact, although they spoke with
different voices. —Professor Jones, now or recently lectur-
ing in Sydney.
Hear the flood of culture gushing
From the classic fount of Jones.
See the stream of phrases rushing
Over Wisdom’s driest bones.
Let us shiver
By the river
Flowing swiftly on its course,
While we wonder
At its thunder
And its terrifying force.
Eating at the banks of Sense
With a strength that is immense,
With a savage, foaming rage
That no mortal can assuage.
Oh ! the day is swiftly dying and the light is very
dim,
And the river’s rather turgid, so we dare not try
to swim.
We can only utter moans
And uneducated groans
By this Stream of Understanding—this appalling
flood of Jones.
See the words like logs go bobbing
As the torrent swifter flows ;
Signs the river has been robbing
Where the dictionary grows.
But they’re tumbled
And they’re jumbled,
And somehow they don’t seem right.
And the roaming
River foaming
Bears them swiftly out of sight.
Ah ! Intelligence’s torch
It can only smoke and scorch ;
Though we hold it up on high
It shows nothing to the eye
But the flooded, rushing river racing wildly on its
course,
Telling absolutely nothing without pity or re-
morse.
So we utter tortured groans,
And low, unenlightened moans
By the side of this dark torrent —this great
cataract of Jones.

are those showing the White Armada at ’Frisco, the
Refractory Saveloy, Mr. Creepy Gets the Creeps,
Doll Making, When Women Rule, Diabolo,
and The Pardon. At the Lyceum one can see the
Sydney tram strike all over again, and at the
Palace Romeo and Juliet play their rather tire-
some love story once more. Romeo was a
young fool, who invariably acted in a hurry and
upset the applecart. This classic upheaval is
balanced at the Lyceum by Quo Vadis and the
Burning of Rome. Writer prefers the Burning of
Rome —a good fire is a charming thing these wet
nights, and the weary dweller in hash towers,
where fires are never lit, can get a suggestion of
home comforts watching that cheerful blaze.
Spencer’s fire film is a public benefaction. Still,
it is a pity that the shows are mixed up.

Sydney Tivoli has managed to beat or tack
out of the doldrums, and is now sailing along at a
fair pace before the breeze of public approbation.
M ignonette Kokin with her joyous dancing, and
the Miles Stavordale quintette with their banjos
and harp, are the members of the crew who en-
liven the quarterdeck most. Regan and Rvan,
Tod Lo'wen and Fred Bluett may be classed as
A.B’s. John Higgins, who jumps with marvel-
lous ease and great decorum, may be taken to
represent the bounding deep. Of the rest of the
ship’s company, Baby Watson is very winsome in
an old-fashioned song, and Fanny Powers does
several clever imitations in song and dance.
Galetti’s dogs and gibbon baboons are mentioned
last on account of their being dogs and baboons.
They are cleverly-trained animals, but the audience
enjoys them most when the apes get impatient
and shake their music stands about the
stage. A serious, thirsty-looking baboon hurrying
into a doll s-house pub with a billycan in his hairy
paw is another incident of the turn that raises
the loud guffaw of approval.

This is a week of last nights and new bills
at the Melbourne theatres. Even “The Merry
Widow ” has received instructions to waltz off.
After Friday, which will be her 77th consecutive
occasion, the wife of the fatuous baron ceases to
wheedle her unlawful adorer into a stuffy summer-
house, and the giddy girls at Maxim’s restaurant
will gid no more. The wife, the waltz and the
widow must go—to return at some future time.
A revival of “The Dairymaids,” beginning on
Saturday, will extend over the brief period of one
week only. General Desire is said to be largely
responsible for the revival, owing to the fact that
Miss Carrie Moore was identified with “The
Dairymaids ”in London, and will here get an
opportunity to resume a character of the kind
most congenial to her temperament. As the
Merry Widow she bears the sweet sad name of
Sonia ’ —and she doesti’t look it. In “The
Dairymaids” she will be Peggy, and her smile
will be free from all restraining influences. Mel-
bourne will rejoice to see Carrie turning the
handle of a butter churn. Also a multitude of
womankind looks forward with tremulous eager-
ness to the appearance of Higginson in a new
Part. _ And every thoughtful person hopes that
Lauri's successor will refrain from painting his
nose red.

At Melbourne Royal a cruel, unrelenting
management announces that these last nights of
“The Fatal Wedding” will never be repeated.
The present downfall of Aunt Cora is to be final,
therefore The Bulletin suggests the addition on
Friday night of a 6th act, showing the place
where Cora lies buried, with the kids from the
alley making merry around her grave. On Satur-
day comes the first production of “Two Little
Sailor Boys,” described as a drama of strenuous
interest.”

It seems that the attractiveness of Ander-
son’s admirable theatre—the King’s—has not
sufficed to make a stupendous triumph for “Man to
Man.”. After all, there is nothing in furniture, fit-
tings, or acoustics to curdle one’s blood or excite
one’s sympathy. And perhaps the brightness of the
auditorium casts unkind reflections upon the dull-
ness of the melodrama, which is so very dull as to
be almost respectable. Neither of these terms
of reproach can be applied to “The Squatter’s
Daughter,” due on Saturday. The hero of that
amazing fiction is usually in a tight place, and Miss
Duggan never fails to save him. When the sun goes
down upon the bushrangers’ wrath, the band
plays, and when the full moon mounts into the
Heavens there is darkness over all the land.
Australia has awarded the cake to “The Squatter’s
Daughter.” Half a million persons, more or less,
have admired the local color in the drama’s
damask cheek. The voice of popular approval
has spoken upon the subject in silvery tones at
many pay-boxes. And when money talks let no
dog bark.

Some bachelors are sullen churls
Whose hearts no women try to win ;
And some resist the wooing girls
Through fear of being “ taken in.”
No thought of marriage-market “ rigs ”
Would haunt the man who makes a match
If wives were all like Mrs. Wiggs,
The angel of the Cabbage Patch.
Mrs. Wiggs, to be sure, is not the whole of the
quaint moraldrama that unfolds itself from the
stage, of Melbourne Princess’s. There are other
married women than Mrs. Wiggs, and the moral
to be deduced from them is that the odds
against a fortunate marriage (for the husband)
are just three to one. Also, there is this
1 g nm > discomforting truth about Mr. Wiggs—he
had the. best-hearted wife in the world, but he
very tired of her. He ran away with a circus
lady, and not until she was dead did he return to
the lawful Mrs. Wiggs—by accident. Had the
circus lady remained alive he would not have
gone back to the angel of the Cabbage Patch,
anyhow. She might have whistled for her Wiggs.
The three other matrons of the “Patch” are
horribly plain. A glance from either of them
would stop a clock. The only visible alternative
to committing holy matrimony with a scarecrow is
to marry a Mrs. Wiggs and desert her. Here
endeth the second lesson.

Mark Hambourg, in whom all good Theo-
sophists recognise the reincarnation of Ruben-
stem, proposes to open his Melbourne season at
the iown Hall on Tuesday next (4th). Pro-
vidence permitting, Mark will get there on the
date aforesaid. He is the one gifted musician
who has appeared and reappeared many times on
the same platform without once failing to get
there. And this time he brings a riper reputation
as a great pianist than he previously brought.

Kubelik s return visit to Melbourne con-
jcludes with a concert to-night (Thursday) at the
. fo n Hall, and because this is the third and last
of the series it will presumably draw three times
as much audience as welcomed the genius back to
the bleak building on Saturday. Of the perfor-
mance he gave to the very few hundreds of people
last Saturday, it would be hard to speak in terms
of too extravagant praise. Perhaps he was a trifle
cold in his first piece—Tartini’s sonata, “ II Trillo
del Diavolo”—but Kubelik in any mood is a
wonderful violinist. He was more delightful
m a Wieniawski concerto, and for an encore
he gave with beautiful effect the Prieslied from
“ Meistersinger.” Subsequently he shook up
the assembled feelings with a G-ipsy Dance
and Bazzini’s “La Ponde Des Lutins a
marvellous piece of execution. Whereupon the
small audience put up a Melbourne record in
applause, and the. artist returned to play “Le
Cygne - ’ with a delicacy and grace that moved the
departing public to recall him again and again,
until he finally surpassed himself in the “Scene
de las Czardas,” by Hubay, a gaudily-variegated
composition which offers superb effects—for
Kubelik. Miss Dyason, the piano soloist, was
more than merely satisfactory in two out of three
bracketed contributions, and Miss Erna Mueller
sang three German songs. The encore she got
might have been better deserved. Her contralto
voice is very limited in expression, and she sings
from the back of her mouth rather than from the
lips.

The Sydney tram-strike was West’s greatest
claim to dazed attention, at Melbourne Olympia,
last Saturday night. This up-to-date film is a
speedy piece of work, to say the least; and, if this
sort of thing becomes chronic, folk will eventually
gaze upon the flickered event while it is still hap-
pening. As for the incidents upon the muslin,
they are simply passionate. One sees the active
crowd surrounding the cars and jostling the faith-
ful uppah officials of Mr. Johnsing j the too few
mounted Johns trying to salvage order from
chaos ; and one almost hears the yell of “ Scab ! ”
as it was yelled last Friday. In short, it is a pic-
tured epigram—that is to say, it attains the
maximum of dazzle and thrill in the least possible
time. The attraction of it was so great that
the big Olympia was crowded by 7.30 p.m.

“0.K.”: The cable states that Mischa
Elman has been engaged for a tour of Australia
next year, and a par. in Melbourne Herald
declares him to be regarded, at 17 years of age, as
the finest violinist in the world. Which is, of
course, claiming too much for the youth. When
I heard him at the Queen’s Hall (London), in
April last, the one startling characteristic of
Mischa Elman’s work was the “singing ” tone he
produced—more marked, perhaps, than the tone
which Kubelik produces in Australia from a
violin which is not his best. But the youngster’s
performance was not otherwise masterly, judged
by the Kubelik standard. It was said afterwards
that he played carelessly on that occason. To me
it seemed that he was devoting himself mainly to
the art of making his fiddle sing.

The Arabs at Melbourne Opera House are
performing their remarkable feats with more
neatness and dispatch than they revealed in the
first instance, if an improvement were possible.
What they do is for the most part only a little
less wonderful than the ease with which they do
it, and what they can’t do is probably not worth
mentioning. For the rest of the bill there are
the Meymotts in a comedy sketch, the Rigolettos,
Austin Rudd, Lottie Kav, etc. Among the
etcetera is Nellie Wilson, who was a member of
the Rickards co. in long, long ago, when the
boss was an occasional visitor to Australia. All
things considered, Nellie calls for respectful
mention.

Adelaide supported “Brewster’s Millions”
through a long run (long for Adelaide), and met
the usual reward of seeing one play fewer than it
would have seen otherwise. The money-scattering
act was, at the last moment, forbidden by the
police. The money-scattering play loses something
by being put in an English dress; the butler, in par-
ticular, is just a stereotyped American burlesque of
the imported London flunkey. “John Glayde’s
Honor,” which ended the short season, is work of
another class. Possibly it is the best “strong”
drama since “Mrs. Tanqueray.” Mrs. Brough was
in her best old form, Kingston in his—though one
can imagine John Glayde as looking quite other-
wise. Similarly with Staveley as Michael
Shurmer. Sweeney, Willey, McMahon, and Miss
Temple all lent distinction to small, but good,
parts, and Miss Irby Marshall left the impression
that she could quite well play the passionate
heroine. After which quite half the co. may be
blamed for that it (excepting Staveley) made no
attempt whatever at an American accent. Mrs.
Brough, going out, met on the doorstep of the Royal
Miss Beatrice Day, coming in to play in “The
Mummy and the Humming Bird.” Those who
saw the two ladies play up to each other in “ Mrs.
Gorringe’s Necklace ” regret that they are not
still together.

“ John ” writes from Maoriland :
At the New Theatre, Christchurch, there happened
recently, for the first time in the Southern Hemisphere, a
play “direct from London and New York,” entitled “The
Prince Chap.” Said play has since been making a record
sprint through M.L., and will strike Australia shortly.
It is a “chee-ild” play, with one or two novel points.
Billy Peyton, a Yankee sculptor in London (he looks
much more like a draper or a grocer), is young and hard
up. In the first act a model, Mrs. Harrington, in the
final stages of bellowdrama consumption, comes to his
studio, and after extracting from Billy a promise that he
will care for her baby girl, Claudia, aged five,
she dies upon his sofa. The end of the act is
taken up with Billy’s struggles to get the kid
undressed ; also his hearing of the usual prayer and the
putting of the youngster to bed. Second act sees Claudia,
aged eight, and witnesses the unexpected arrival of Billy’s
best girl from Noo York. She “ has heard all about
Claudia,” and believes that Billy is the father of the
adopted “ chee-ild.” He laughs the accusation to scorn,
and hegs of the best girl to marry him. She demands
that he send little Claudia away, which he refuses to do.
Exit best girl, breathing flames from her nose and mouth
and blowing hard. The last scene of that act shows the
artists who infest the adjoining rooms showering presents
on Claudia and singing foolish songs such as no self-respect-
ing artist ever dreams of singing. Last of all comes a
present from the best girl in the shape of Billy’s let-
ters, with a note to say she has married the Pork
King. In the third act Claudia is 18. Billy and the
artists have aged considerably and prospered exceed-
ingly during the five minutes’ interval. Billy is now the
greatest sculptor of the day, and lives in splendor on the
beef and gravy of the land. The Earl of Henningford, an
artist and Billy’s life-long friend, who helped with the
other artists to bring Claudia successfully to the verge of
womanhood, is madly in love with Claudia. He asks
Billy’s permission to marry her, and in giving it Billy
betrays to the audience that he himself is in love with
Claudia. The peer proposes, but Claudia only laughs at
him, and in the same instant discovers that she really
loves “ Daddy,” as she calls Billy. Billy’s best girl here
turns up casually, and observes that the Pork Monarch is
dead, and that the sculptor is her only love. Evidently with
the object of rushing matters- she remarks that she is
leaving for Amurka immediately. Billy coldly wishes her
a pleasant voyage. At the end Billy has Claudia in his
arms and promises that they will be one for ever more.
So the female portion of the audience gets its desires. The
co. which produced this play gathered in Christchurch
from the four corners of the earth. H. R. Roberts, a
M.L.-born actor from London, where he created the rdle,
starred as Billy ; but Frank Lamb, straight from Noo
York, where he originally filled the part, played Billy’s
old man-servant, Marcus Runion, so finely that
it became the star part of the play. It is a big
part, and Lamb’s conception of the character of
the stolid servant was a revelation. The comic
element was well attended to by Mary Keogh,
also of Noo York, in the part of Phoebe Puckers, who
attends to the fires in the artist’s quarters and sleeps in
the cellar amongst the rats, defying the cold with the
aid of a hot brick. It takes three persons to make
Claudia a success. A child of 10 in the first act, another
of 13 in the second, and one of, probably, 26 in the third,
the latter being Justina Wayne, another Yankee impor-
tation, whose methods are quiet and delightfully natural.
AT POVERT POINT.
Melbourne has just got word that the Kilties are cornin’
a week previous to the arrival of the Yankee Fleet in
local waters. The Kilties, as everybody will learn pre-
sently, are the Scottish Canadian bandsmen who toured
England three years ago, and so charmed the Royal
breast of King Edward that he “ commanded ” them to
appear at Sandringham on his birthday, after having
heard them at Balmoral. Apart from their brass-band
performance and their airy costume, the Kilties are some-
thing of a variety show. The programme includes reel
dancing and singing of Scawtch ballads, ye ken. And
piping ! The pipers, it seems, are utilised as a walking
advt. of the band. Half-a-dozen of them, or more, headed
by two drum-majors who stand over 7ft. high behind
their philibegs, are deputed to march through the toon
in full sw'irl to give the girls a treat. In Melbourne the
Kilties are to create a profound sensation at the Exhibi-
tion building, where the noise of 40 brass instruments
gets plenty of space to diffuse in.
Frank Hawthorne, son of the Australian stage veteran,
Mr. W. J. Wilson, once of Majeroni and Wilson, is at pre-
sent in England, playing at the Opera House at Tunbridge
Wells, the place where the ancient Roman used to soak
himself in warm mud to cultivate a good complexion on
his back. He (Frank Hawthorne, not the Roman) is
taking part in a musical extravaganza, written by Miss
Kate Howard, also from Australia, and giving the Tun-
bridge Wellers good value for their money. The Austra-
lian is cropping up all over the world, playing many parts
in many lands, and holding his own in most of them.
“ 10-2-4 ” : It has come. Thus a Melbourne paper fore-
shadowing future productions at Bilanderson’s new
King’s Theatre : “In a few' weeks’ time the company will
produce ‘Romeo and Juliet.’ The Shakspearian play-
will be gorgeously mounted. Of course Miss Eugenie
Duggan will be the Juliet, and Mr. George Cross the
Romeo, of the revival.” And Bert Bailey will presum-
ably give a side-shattering rendition of the Nurse; w-hile
the tall young man w-ho usually plays the malignant
Bart, in a frock coat, cloth cap and cigarette, will
be Friar Laurence, unless someShakspeare enthusiast cen-
sors him with a revolver.
“Cockaigne”: Maughan is the crack dramatist of the
hour, with four pieces running at once in London West
End theatres. There was just such a run on Sims, almost
in the last generation. Like Maughan, he had a stock of
things ready-written, and rushed them out when his
vogue came. None of them survive. Only “The Lights
o’ London ” is a memory'. What has become of Davis,
author of “Cousin Kate” and “Mrs. Gorringe’s Neck-
lace ”? And what of Marshall, author of “ The Second in
Command”? Play's are like fashionable bonnets, worth
forty' guineas this year and fourpence *ext. Even Pinero
and Jones don’t permanently enrich literature w'ith any-
thing. Bernard Shaw has the best chance of coming out
alive. Time was when Barrie had his three pieces going
at once: “ The Admirable Crichton,” “Quality Street ’’and
“Little Mary.” I think “Peter Pan” will endure like
“ Rip Van Winkle.” But very few things endure.
“Bloggs”: I never properly realised the feeble uncon-
vincingness of the stage mob’s enraged howl till I heard a
crowd in Sydney greet one of the scab drivers last
week. It was the real thing, charged with hate, venom,
and menace. How thin beside it sounded in memory’s
ear the perfunctory “Ahr-r-r! Uhr-r-r! Gr-r-r!” of the
French Revolutionary supers clamoring round the
tumbrils for the gore of the old Count—he of the Byronic
shirt collar and the beautful, pathetic eyes. I would
back half-a-dozen youths with a score or so of decayed
eggs to make a more convincing uproar, without previous
rehearsal, in the presence of plain Bill Blackleg, than four
times that number of hired demonstrators (however
assiduously schooled) in the comparatively calm atmo-
sphere of the limelight.
Fred B. Norton, who for some years past has been
spinning yarns in the Melbourne Theatre programmes,
found a topical subject in the name of Wenman, who
stage-manages “Miss Hook of Holland.” Wenman’s
brother, it seems, was a member of Richard Mansfield’s
company when that autocratic American personage re-
proved him for adopting an inhuman make-up in “a
stout, pompous character.” What Mansfield specially
objected to was the “make-up” of the stummick.
Whereupon Wenman explained that the stummick he
carried was all his own. Its unnaturalness had been
forced upon him in the ordinary course of nature.
The late Dan B Stay's personal 'estate < onsets mostly of
small sums of standing to his credit at divers
banks scattered dyer'VictoriaF A)n his dea't ji-peti—by the
way, Dan was said dreaiLo'fiiieath—he
was questioned as vytiereab'<m'ts of his mptiey- His
troubles !He replied,Xo Jy£' therhJ ncjjf!? r ) Dari Barry
was thwarted in one of hisdast OTjfenjptst at topical melo-
drama. At one time or otheMifeduta J&.Qfifcted by various
kinds of sensational crime—as, for'iHStarice the Deeming
murder, which he turned to account in a Melb. Alexandra
melodrama, wherein the villain buried his wife’s corpse
under a hearthstone. Dan snatched at the newest thing
in newspaper horrors and dragged it into a drama with-
out the least compunction. But when he announced a
grand biographic representation of the murder of Bauer,
the Melbourne diamond merchant, the performance was
interdicted, to Dan’s grief and disgust. Perhaps the
police feared that the murderer in Dan’s pictures would
be too suggestive of the man who might have been
arrestecl on the strength of reasonable suspicion and
wasn’t. It was said, at the time, that the relatives of the
victim protested against any mimic representation of his
murder. Unfortunately there was no question of in-
justice to a prisoner on trial. The man who slew Bauer
has never been arrested, nor ever will be, seemingly.
Edmund Gwenn is slowly but surely making his mark
in London. The Stage Society put up a Dutch play,
“Links,” and the Times says that Gwenn, with one
Fisher White, “stood out prominently from a good all-
round oast.” A scene between the two was “one of
those things to which criticism would venture to point as
a specimen of what English acting can do at its best.”
Gwenn is compared with the Frenchman Guitry, “an
actor whom we hold to be the most veracious artist of
his time.”
Dear B .—Re Annie Besant’s “complexion pink as a rose
petal,” and the “occult secret of her astounding com-
plexion ” (B. 23/7/’08). I recollect her when she was a
hard-working journalist woman in London 18 years ago.
Her complexion was then somewhat leaden, her hair was
streaked with grey, and she had a very red nose. She
told me she had abandoned politics, because they “neces-
sitated compromise, and she could not compromise on
eternal truth.” Next time I saw her, four years later,
the touch of lovely age was on her. Her hair was silky
white, the delicate pink of the face had begun, and Time
had commenced to use pastels on her nose, and rescue it
from the journalistic redness which I had hitherto
noticed. In her case, age has been a god of beneficence
and beauty. Before concluding, allow me to add a
tribute of admiration to this noble woman, strong in her
convictions, serene in her beliefs, disdainful of calumny,
intellectually as virile as De Stael, George Sand, or
Madame Roland, and beautifully womanly with it all.
What a pity Buddhism and not Catholicism attracted
her! She would be canonised (in the latter case), about
the year 2050, as St. Anne the Second.—Yours, Locust.
“ Ami ” : Apparently I have angered some veteran of
the Dan Barry companies (possibly Dan once owed him
half a quid), and yet I will hold to my positions about
Dan. Regarding his taking the fat parts. May be the
correspondent acted with him in his management of the
Melbourne Alexandra, now Her Majesty’s? Will he
kindly cast up the number of times that Dan gave himself
the leading character there ? Not in more than one piece
out of five. However, the critic evidently has his eye on
the Theatre Royal, Bakblok. Well, the public round the
Bush would insist on Dan being protagonist. He must be
like Bland Holt, with the whole drama revolving round
him, a process which Bland and Dan knew to be
false art. If either of those gentlemen had only said
“M’ Lord, the carriage waits,” the whole piece would
have circled round it, and the actor would have been
compelled to come to the float and add, “ Also, I do not
hesitate to affirm that the man who lays his hand upon a
woman, save in the way of kindness, is a wretch whom it
would be base flattery to call a slave.” Bakblok actors
should remember their debt to Barry—the charla-
tan, if you will. Without him they wouldn’t draw
worth a cent. All the drawing power was in him.
You must recognise that Dan Barry, in his humble vul-
garian way, was Bakblok magnetic. I said he was an
indifferent actor, and will almost allow he was a bad one,
yet he had a share of that frowsy kind of nimbus which
enveloped the great genius Frederic Lemaitre, in “Robert
Macaire.” As a character actor, in pure artistry, he was
not fit to hold a candle even to the afflicted Ignatius
Keogh, who often performed with him, and I will agree
with your correspondent if he says that Dan had half a
dozen actors better than himself in his troupe. Yet, even
on the stage, he was the Bakblok paste diamond that out-
shone their genuine glitter. I must also insist that his
physique -was thin. To make sure of being heard, he had
to fling out his sentences like pistol shots.
Talking of the “Cabbage Patch” drama at Melb.
Princess’s. The first act is the interior of one room in
the Wiggs mansion, for which presentment the whole
stage is occupied. Yet, in the second, the whole of the
Wiggs palace is shown, occupying but a few square feet
at the back of the stage—the balance of the floor space
being used up for pocket gardens and the microscopic
dwellings of Mrs. Stubbins and the strident Eichorn
body. Compare Acts I. and 11., and the size of the room
with the size of the house, and it will be seen that, though
the room is part of the house, it can quite comfortably
accommodate even a couple of the same size in its interior.
This fact slaughters a well-known geometrical axiom.
But in the stage world even a fifth floor “ attic ” is com-
monly represented as a spacious apartment, large enough
for a meeting hall, with bedrooms attached. Mrs.
Denver’s cottage in “ The Silver King ” was about the first
attempt to provide Poverty with a natural habitation,
but inasmuch as it emphasised the fact that all stage
rooms have one wall missing, the innovation was
burlesqued.
“Star” : “ Melb.” (8., 13/7/’08) points to “Mrs. Wiggs of
the Cabbage Patch ” as a model for aspiring Australian
playwrights, and suggests that Steele Rudd, Lawson and
Dyson might take the hint. Now, as a matter of fact,
“ Mrs. Wiggs ” does not begin to be a play ; it is without
form and void, and its success is purely a success of
actors. It is the quaint character-acting that makes it a
money-maker ; the author’s work is trumpery, arid that
of the dramatists quite without merit. Put average
actresses into such parts as Miss Hazy, Mrs. Wiggs, and
Mrs. Eichorn, and the show is “done in.” There is matter
in “On Our Selection,” in Lawson’s connected sketches,
in “ Fact’ry’Ands,” and in “By Rail and Semaphore,”
for comedies like “Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch,”
but if the authors devoted their time and talents to pre-
paring their work for the stage, it is a hundred to one
they would never derive a grain of satisfaction, let alone
a trifle of material profit from their labors. Even if they
found a manager, what would be their chance of securing
actors who could represent their broad types as incisively
as half-a-dozen people are portrayed in the American
play ? This is not a condemnation of Australian actors,
but the profession has never had an opportunity of deal-
ing with local character, and types have to be built, even
on the stage. They do not come up in a night like
Jonah’s brolly.
“C.P.”: For champion variety showman of Australia
I hereby beg to enter a back-blocks parson of my ac-
quaintance. Following is a recent week’s programme :
Monday night, chairman at a harvest home concert, sang
two solos and afterwards conducted a Bruce auction ;
Tuesday night, a lantern lecture on “ Tower of London ”
in neighboring township; Wednesday afternoon, con-
ducted wedding ceremony ; Thursday night, chairman at
temperance meeting, thrilling recitation and brilliant
speech ; Friday night, trained Sunday-school kids for a
cantata ; Saturday afternoon, made thirty-six for local
cricket club and proposed health of visiting team ;
Sunday morning, noon, and night, preached, prayed and
sang incessantly ; and at short intervals wrestled violently
with Beelzebub and the serried hosts of the under-world.
Can anyone beat this record?

The post-card mania subsides. In Melbourne, post-card
shops have closed down, and suburban vendors of the
painted female agree mournfully that she has slumped,
and has become a dreary and unsaleable drug - on the
market. —Neivspaper item.
The craze subsides!
Our thanks are due unto the Powers that be,
That having reached by giant leaps and strides
The giddy heights of popularity,
It now subsides.
The craze will die !
No more, with painted cheek and saucer eye,
Shall the gay actress from shop windows leer,
With cunning smile luring us in to buy—
(The money will be better spent on beer,
When times are dry).
And foreign singers, with their progeny
In grinning row, will shortly disappear ;
The Melbourne view, printed in Germany,
Will also go. For this we raise a cheer.
The thing will die.
The craze will end !
No more shall impecunious Algy send
The jewelled card his best girl loves to hoard ;
Nor on the tinselled pasteboard dollars spend
That should have gone to liquidate his board.
The views that haunt us as we daily wend
Our way of toil ; the female sparsely clad ;
The politician with his canine friend
At heel; fine art in every shape gone mad—
All these will end.
When everyone is done, and all is said,
The voice of Common Sense at last is heard.
The craze must die ! Its life is almost sped.
Then may it be cremated and interred
When it is dead.

A trip up the Zambesi River, where we saw hippo-
potami and other strange creatures, was also part of our
South African experiences.— Mark Hambourg.
(To be set to music.)
He stood upon Zambesi’s bank,
Tlie wind uncombed his greasy lank
Goal-colored hair;
And there he thunk, and thunk, and thank,
While many a hippo, rank on rank,
Came up to stare.
“ How very, very strange they are,”
He said ; “ and how pe-cu-li-ar—
They frighten me ! ”
Then ev’ry hippo cried “ Hurroar !
He thinks US strange, but he’s not more
Surprised than we ! ”

The most remarkable feature about the
new amateur tram conductor in Sydney is the
way he falls right out into tlie road with his tickets
and his bag when the car starts. The walking
public, which isn’t accustomed to have conductors
falling upon its head, will yet be seriously
damaged.

POET: “How do you know
the editor is too busy to
see me?"
BOY: “By the length of yer hair!”
Quite a lot of Sydney’s junior clerks and
shopmen and shopgirls, whose money doesn’t run
to cab-fares, have decided these last few stormy
days, while Hoofing it wearily from the big shops
to Owe’Sullivan’s railway station to get the slow
train for Newtown, that the said station is very
much out of the way. And as they toiled wearily
up the big incline they also decided that it is
perched on a very tall knob. Still there is a fine
view from the verandah when you get there.

The attitude of N.S.W. Railway Com-
missioner Johnson in the matter of Croucher, the
dismissed tram conductor, round whom the big
storm gathered, was wholly unaccountable.
Croucher had been proved (provided the official
spies told the truth, and provided they hadn’t
mixed up their tickets and thus muddled their
evidence in a hard knot) of defrauding the Depart-
ment. Yet Johnson said that he might apply to be
re-instated in six months. Now, if Johnson was
dead sure that Croucher was dishonest, why talk
of re-instatement six months hence or at any
time? The case called for gaol rather than for
re-instatement. And if he wasn’t sure, why was
Croucher sacked ? The proposal sounded like
that quaint old verdict: “We find the prisoner
guilty, but as we aren’t sure he did it we recom-
mend him to mercy.”

On Saturday, August 8, a new illustrated
weekly paper, entitled White Australia, will
make its first appearance in Sydney. Its mission
will be to endeavor to further healthy white im-
migration, and it will be distinctly anti-color,
except in its weekly cartoon. As it is reported
that it is backed by many influential people, in-
terested in immigration and the filling up of our
blank spaces, it should have, at least, a good start.
It will be edited by Mr. J. A. Crain, who
past 10 years has been a contributor to The
Bulletin. -

Ballarat claims to have been the birth-
place of “the smallest known baby in the world.”
The mite—a girl—weighed only 140 z., or 7oz. less
than a previous mite born at Burlington, U.S.A.
The Ballarat phenomenon was on view a while at
Melbourne Waxworks ; but alas ! she grew to nor-
mal size as the result, seemingly, of being taken to
live at Queenscliff (Vic.). On her third birthday,
which happened last week, the interesting damsel
measured 2ft. Bin., and weighed 2st. 51b. Even
if the Ballarat baby was a record breaker in the
first instance, which is doubtful, her reign
was very brief. As for the Burlington
(U.S.A.) baby, it was just nowhere from the
start in comparison with Lucia Zarate, the
famous Mexican midget of yore. Lucia, at
18 years of age, when she was taken to
London in company with “General Mite,”
weighed less than 51b. Considering the inhu-
man littleness of her at that time there was no
reason to doubt the statement that she had
weighed only lib. when she was 12 months old,
and had been kept in cotton wool in the mean-
time. All the midgets ever exhibited (not exclud-
ing Genera] Mite, who weighed 91b.) were giants
in comparison with Lucia Zarate. She hopped
around like a bird, and her aquiline nose sug-
gested a bird’s beak. Her middle finger, deco-
rated with a diamond ring, was no thicker than
an ordinary stick of slate-pencil. But she lived,
and seemed healthy enough. Her death, which
was a sad blow to the management, happened in
her 23rd year, as the result of bad weather. She
was travelling around as usual, when the train got
snowed up—in America—and she perished of cold.
The custodians of Lucia couldn’t keep her blood
circulating. Her remains were enclosed in a
glove-box, or something similar, and buried in the
little parsley bed whence she came.

Sydney Watchman weighed in last week
with a letter under the scare heading “ A Warn-
ing From the Old Land,” in which letter “Man-
chester Protestant ” gravely proposed the destruc-
tion of Rome. Some extracts :
Hilaire Maraud-Safran, one of the most gifted of
France’s polemical writers to-day, discussing this point in
a recent issue of the Revue des deux Mondes, touched on
the nossibility of a wholesale resumption policy in regard
to Rome at the hands of the enlightened peoples of the
world. . ,
A huge proportion of the Italian nation have long since
thrown’off the yoke of the Vatican ; the educated Italian
has scant cause to love the city which recalls to him so
many centuries of priestly tyranny and papal infamy. It
is climatically and otherwise a far inferior site for a capi-
tal of modern Italy than, say, Florence, or one of the
other great Italian towns. Maraud-Safran’s scheme
made, in effect, for the gradual obliteration by equitable
forced resumption of the city which stands to-day as a
symbol of the great lying faith, and he supplies figures
and facts to show his was not the impossible dream LA
Croix and other Romanist organs tried to make out. He
proposes, in fact, the destruction of the city of Rome,
reasonable compensation being paid to the present owners
a matter to which the Protestants of the world would
gladly subscribe. Even the name of the city would
vanish, and the Roman Catholic Church would then be-
come a homeless creed cut away from the root. ...
Rome to-day, as a thousand years ago, connotes Scrip-
tural and social ignorance, stagnation, bigotry, and fur-
tive vice. She clamors for decisive handling. While
Rome exists as a city, an inspiring rallying centre is
there for the obscurantism, mariolatry, and idolatry
which the Roman faith comprises. Her city gone,
Romanism will go too. Protestantism has achieved
triumphs almost as great as this would be since Luther
first set out an obscure teacher, to give the open Bible to
the world. We who are fighting for the cause in the Old
Land are heartened at the thought that The Watchman
is with us in our work.
The bland suggestion that the capital, city of a
great European Power be “ obliterated ” by total
strangers on a point of religious prejudice may
pass muster. The Watchman’s {schemes
mostly along grandiose lines of that Sort. The
things that take this paper’s fancy are the authori-
ties quoted. When did the Revue des deux
Mondes touch “on the possibility of a wholesale
resumption policy in regard to Rome at the hands
of the enlightened peoples of the world ” ? What
issue of La Croix tried to show “ Maraud-
Safran’s” Rome-resumption proposal was an “im-
possible dream ” ? As a fact, there is no such per-
son as “Maraud-Safran” “Safran” signifies
“ vellow.” in French : “Maraud” means “ pup.
A Gaul afflicted with a name like Mr. Yellow-Pup
would destroy himself. The Revue des deux
Mondes never considered the possibility of resum-
ing Rome; nor did any newspaper oppose the
astounding proposition. The Watchman has had
its leg dragged badly by someone, and the solemn
reference to Mr. Yellow-Pup is a hilarious item.
Sydney Harbor is losing an old water-
mark. For years and years the Oceanic Steam-
ship Co. has had an old coal-hulk moored in
Neutral Bav—all that was left in these parts of
the once-famous battleship Nelson. It is just 100
years since its old wooden ribs were hewn out;
then, when it had had its day, and was “ good
enough for Australia,” it was swung-to in Mel-
bourne Harbor, and later on was used there as a
training ship ; and finally, when it was no longer
wanted for that, it was sawn up, and half of it was
towed to Sydney to be used as a
coal-hulk. Now the Oceanic
Co. has gone out of the
Australian business, so
the Union Co. has
bought the old bi-
sected centenarian
and towed it to
Hobart, where it
will still pursue
its old grimy
calling.

North Sydney Council is in the centre of
a big endeavor to obliterate the awful boardings
which disfigure Kirribilli Point. The owners
have defied the aldermen, and the Council is
debating whether it can afford a lawsuit. New-
town, another pocket handkerchief borough, has
grappled with the advertisement fiend by raising
the monster’s license fee for hoardings from Id. to
ss. per square foot. Vested Interests, in the shape
of the paste-pot man, are raising Cain over this
interference with Private Enterprise, and com-
merce is bringing powerful influences to bear on
the council. A backdown of the suburban
fathers is expected. When Greater Sydney can
tackle the question as a whole, things will pro-
bably be done, but the advertisement hoarding
monstrosity seems to be too much for the 43
mayors and sets of aldermen.

On July 11 four men working in the
Wallsend (N.S.W.) colliery fell 34ft., through
the breaking of a girder, and one of them was
killed. The coroner’s jury found (1) that the
girder was defective ; and (2), seeing that the
timber to repair the hopper, of which the girder
was a part, had been lying on the ground for
months past, the jury was of opinion that the
necessary repairs should have been carried out
long before. But it further found (3) that in a
criminal sense no one could be held responsible.
On the jury’s own finding, it looks as if the case
should not be left at that. The need for repairs
was surely obvious when the timber for repairing
purposes was ordered, and as that was some
months before the work was done, it would seem
that a visibly dilapidated structure must have, all
the time, been growing more dilapidated right
before the eyes of some person in authority.
William McMillan’s Farmers and Settlers’
Co-operative Co. has landed a whole lot of trustful
N. S. Wales cockies in such a horrible mess that
“the backbone of the country” probably hasn’t
got the same opinion that it had a while ago con-
cerning the Heaven-born financier. Though for
at least three years past city financial men could
plainly see the wolf staring in at the door of this
utterly miscalled “co-operative” concern, scores
of farmers continued to cheerfully send along
wheat, because, of course, a concern with the
newspaper-boomed McMillan as chairman must
be all right. However, the crash came; and
when it did come there were 40,000 or more
bags of wheat in the co.’s grain-sheds. Some
of the grain had been advanced against pend-
ing sale ; the co. had made advances to the
farmers, and the City Bank had made advances to
the co. Now the consignors want their wheat,
and the bank says that the wheat is pledged to it;
whereupon the consignors say they don’t know
the bank from a blue crow—all they want is their
wheat. The City Bank admits that in the sheds
there may be wheat which it hasn’t got any claim
to, but one bag of wheat is much like another bag
of wheat, and in heaps of cases the bag of wheat
that the bank has a mortgage over can’t be told
from the other bag of wheat, and nobody knows
what to do about either bag. Meantime it is costing
£2O a week to keep the wheat stored, and the official
liquidator, when he looks at that amount, and
then at all the liabilities, wants to sell. Also some
consignors want to sell, but some consignors don’t
—all they want is their wheat. Equity Judge
Street was implored, the other day, to authorise
the sale; one K.C. and 19 other lawyers said
they wanted him to do it, and one K.C. and six
other lawyers said they didn’t care whether he
did it or not, and a third K.C. and about 14 other
lawyers said with great respect that his Honor
daren’t do it. His Honor didn’t do it; instead
he ordered the lawyers to prepare to argue about
something else. Meantime Costs and mice are
having a great time, and the weevil is beginning
to get a look-in. And “the backbone of the
country ” —well, he doesn’t count. Moreover,
Mr. W. McMillan is carefully forgotten.
The Hog in the Car fell out with a bump
in the recent test case taken before N.S.W. Justice
Sly, in Chambers. Various motor hogs had been
fined £3 each for “furious driving” along Rocky
Point-road, Rockdale. The test case hung on the
word “ furious.” Defendant said he was going
16 miles an hour—an ordinary gait for a car, and
not by any means a furious rate. The police said
he was going a 25-mile bat, and a furious bat too.
Justice Sly declined to go into the point that 16
miles was not furious—for a motor car. As the
magistrate decided that the defendant was going
at a “furious” rate, it was immaterial what the
speed per hour was at that particular time. For
instance, five miles an hour would be “furious” for
a telegraph messenger, while 50,000 wouldn’t be
“ furious ” for a comet. A motor car, doing 20
miles an hour across Siberia in the Round-the-
World race, could be accused of loafing; a car
doing two miles through a political meeting could
be tried for manslaughter. The rate was nothing,
said Sly, and the circumstances everything, and
the magistrate, having all the circumstances before
him, had to decide the case on its merits. This
was the substance of the decision of Sly J., and
all the arguments of the expensive K.C. and his
less expensive Junior failed to shift him.
An ornamental table,
doing service for small card-
parties in a fashionable Sydney
home, was picked up by the mistress
at a sale in Yokohama. The lady
explains that this neat little table
of papier-mache was made wholly
out of Bibles which were supplied
to the Japanese by the Foreign
Missions of England and America.
The Bibles are distributed gratuitously,
or sold below cost price, and the Jap has
them made into pulp, and next into mache, and
then finally, the Word, to supply which to the
heathen many a deluded and ill-fed religionist lias
deprived himself or herself of a much-needed
copper or two, becomes a gambling table or a puff
box. Lately there was a considerable holy whoop
in Sydney about the increasing demand for Bibles
in China and Japan. Of course there is an in-
creasing demand, so long as the Scripture is
supplied free, or so cheaply that it is worth making
out of it.

The big bill for the Vic. Sunshine disaster

advance accounts begin to float in. Coroner Cole

is thinking hard. Also, one witness who was
subpoenaed attended every day that evidence was
taken, and has now fired in a bill for the whole

Bent is also giving way to earnest thought.

The luck of the Mavis, the rakish-looking
craft now lying in Sydney Harbor, appears to be
out. Everyone who has anything to do with her
gets arrested. She was purchased about a year
ago by two gilded and sparkish youths,
and their luck faded away to nothingness
on the spot. Finally, they steered her into
Sydney, and either under her influence or that of
beer began throwing furniture at a local barmaid.
For this they were seized and mulcted in large
fines. Saddened, they left the country, and the
hoodoo vessel was advertised as for sale. At long
last a buyer appeared. He represented, he said,
a wealthy syndicate that wanted a ship in a hurry.
Arrangements were hardly completed when the
head of the syndicate was grabbed by the police
on a charge of embezzlement. Nor are these the
only episodes of the sort the craft has known.
There is a distinct and uncanny connection be-
tween the Mavis and the Law in its most appre-
hensive mood.

Wellington (M.L.), which has been revel-
ling in a land boom for the last few years, is now
suffering a slump. It is not, so far, a very pre-
cipitous slump, but the pace may quicken till it
becomes an avalanche. When the Empire City
began to boom, the cute ones rushed out, and
borrowed money, and snapped up all the available
city and suburban sites. Values began to climb
up, house property became dearer and dearer,
and rents grew to be almost prohibitive. And
these conditions continue, but the number of
empty houses is growing, regardless of the fact that
the population still increases. The average family
has given up dreaming of having a house all to
itself, and “sharing” is general. Half the popu-
lation of Wellington has been driven by the fear-
some rents to live in boarding-houses, and the
other half has taken to sharing houses or dividing
cottages into two, and calling the divisions “flats.”
Now the crop of empty houses has brought about
the dumping on the market, says the Dominion,
of “enough real estate and house property to
supply the bona-fide requirements of 200,000
people, while the population of Wellington is
roughly only about 64,000.” Therefore there is
weeping and gnashing of front tooth. Still, it is
good for the great bulk of the community. If the
drop continues, the people of the rain-swept, wind-
blown city may escape the horrors of the hash
tower and resume house-keeping in a wooden
shanty in the suburbs.
THE SONG OF THE SILLY YOUNG FOOL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The pretty girl really has an uncommonly hard time.
. . . The Anglican Bishop of Ballarat caps her mis-
fortunes by assuring- her that “lovable but foolish”
young men will want to marry her. . . . When we want
to marry, we all pick out the plainest women we can find
—or, at least, all who are wise do so ; but the foolish
young man chooses the pretty girl.—Argus (HI7/’08).
I don’t care what racket the other bloke tries when he’s
choosing his permanent tart,
But it’s only a girl that’s a gem with blue eyes that’ll
print her brand deep on my heart;
And if I’m a fool—well, I mean what I say, and the spring-
time is coming along !
Yes, the early spring budlets are bursting, and they have
worried my soul into song,
And the sun is plain gold in the glorified blue, and the
sunshiny garden-seats call one !
Ah, the plentiful wattles are blooming to-day,
And I can’t help the pretty girls staring my way !
Oh, dash it! Life’s short, and the plain girl is too, and I
always did fancy a tall one !
The practical girl is the girl you should hunt if you want
to make life a success !
You need a plain girl that disdains a sham “ front,” and
’ll do with but one Sunday dress —
A good, strapping wench that’ll chop wood and scrub,
and will never use Rosemary soap
For her face, but will spend half her time at the tub, and
will fatten on toil and on hope.
Ah, well, she may do for a Solon like you, with an eye on
your dibs at the banker’s,
But I want a nice girl with a “bang” of pure gold,
And a neat, rounded figure of exquisite mould,
With a face of a beautiful rose-petal hue—it’s for beauty'
my silly soul hankers !

S.A. Customs officers have made things
very awkward for an elderly Chinaman who came
from Melbourne (transhipped from a foreign
steamer), claiming admission on the papers of a
youth of 20, who lived in the State 55 years ago.
He argued that he had altered a-good deal in the
interval, but the officials thought he didn’t look
75 or near it; and while they were still arguing,
the steamer started and took him onto Fremantle.
On the return trip he had another shot. The
young Chow of the papers had been a farmer for
five years, and could write English easily ; the
old Chow in the flesh could not write a word (he
said he had forgotten it in the half-century inter-
val), and on the subject of farming his memory
was a blank. So the Not Proven verdici was
passed again, and the Kyarra took him bade to his
starting-place at Melbourne. It had carried him
3000 miles, and found him three weeks’ board and
lodging for his 20-shilling steerage ticket, and is
likely to be more careful in future.

According to Victoria’s chief gambling-
suppression ’tec, that State has spent a good
many pounds in marking Chow tickets to secure
convictions for running lotteries, but its total
winnings come to less than £2. The most Ah Fat
pays on a sixpenny ticket is £75, if ten figures are
correctly marked; that is, he lays 3000 to 1 against
the hacker doing a feat the actuarial odds against
which are over 11,000,000 to 1. The Law makes
a poor show as a gambler, but its fines more than

“ Briner ” writes :
The Kearsarge and Alabama are included among
the U.S. battleships for Australia. The whole fleet is
under 10 years old, launched since the war with Spain.
The original U.S. frigate Kearsarge destroyed the Con-
federate cruiser Alabama, off Cherbourg, France. Cap-
tain Semmes, of the Alabama, escaped to England in Mr.
Lancaster’s yacht, which watched the battle. Mrs.
Lancaster was on board, and besought her husband not
to leave Cherbourg, but when she saw the fight she said,
“Closer, closer!” just like a woman. The Alabama’
which destroyed an enormous number of merchant ships,
was a three-masted schooner, with auxiliary steam, sister
vessel to Brassey’s Sunbeam, both built by Laird of
Birkenhead. She cleared out from there just before an
order to stop her arrived from the British Government.
After the war arose the Alabama claims. The appalling
sum of £9,000,000 sterling was demanded by the U.&”.
Government. There was danger of war. An Interna-
tional Arbitration Court was agreed to, and met at
Geneva. This awarded about £3,240,000. The
British Government paid it. Yet the U.S. Govern-
ment had a balance of £2,000,000 sterling
over when all just claims had been settled.
The last I can trace of this money is nearly ten years
after the Arbitration, when a vast amount of interest had
accrued. I presume the U.S. Government mopped the
lot up. The payment for damages included some on
account of the cruiser Shenandoah, because it was allowed
to refit in Melbourne, and ship coal and men. Captain.
Waddell, of the Shenandoah, afterwards commanded a
steamer between Sydney and San Francisco. The Shen-
andoah officers were entertained by the Melbourne Club.
They put up at Cleeland’s Albion Hotel, Bourke-street.
Cleeland was so pleased with them that he named his
grey racing filly Shenandoah, and she was in favor for a
Melbourne Cup, but missed it. Cleeland afterwards won
with Wollomai, named after his coast property, where the
mutton-birds are.

A man who was there, but who escaped
arrest, sends this tale :
Year in and 3 r ear out the Law pursues the furtive “ two-
upper ” with enthusiasm and regularity. The unfortu-
nate who is addicted to “ headin’ ’em ” plays his game,
surrounded bj- scouts, on a bleak, vacant allotment, or
else he flies madly up lanes and across back-yards ; while
the fatted importer plays .Bridge at home through the
yawning abyss of Sunday and fearlessly stares the wander-
ing John in the eye.
The largest. Victorian stronghold of the kip was burst
up on a recent Sunday. The academy’s meeting place
was on a depressing plain at Port Melbourne adjacent to
a large soap factory, and the system of scouting was so
good that .the police had no chance of raiding the two-up
university in the usual stately and gradual fashion.
But the brains of the vast organisation that regulates
Melbourne and catches nothing were working all the
time, and at last they evolved a Plot. At five o’clock
one Sunday morning, eight constables presented them-
selves at the door of the soap factory and informed the
amazed caretaker in a hoarse whisper that they would
take care of the building and the bad smells for the day.
The watchman, rather reluctantly, handed over the klys,
and about half-a-ton of policeman, armed with field-
glasses and note hooks, climbed heavily up to the topmost
floor, where it flattened its official nose against the
windows and fixed a glare of suspicion on the dreary
waste below.
Two fragrant Sabbath hours crawled by like a couple
of grey and aged and breathless sea-serpents going to see
their daug'hter’s baby. At last, about 7 o’clock, the out-
posts appeared and inspected the surrounding landscape.
Shortly afterwards school opened with an attendance of
something like 150 pupils. To the monotonous cry of
‘ Ten-bob heads ! ” “ Five-bob heads ! ” the weary gamble
proceeded. The hours ambled sleepily, like fat dogs,
towards Monday, and the police stealthily used their
telescopes and made copious notes in disguised hand-
writing.
At 1 o’clock the educational establishment adjourned
for dinner.
At 2o clock it resumed its studies, with an attendance
of about 400. Right through the afternoon the wicked
people played, and still the towering soap factory, burst-
ing with secrecy and policeman, smelt peacefully to
Heaven in dead silence, as it had done on many a bygone
day. .
atflve o’clock, when the evening shadows had
stretched themselves out to their full length and were
thinking of turning in for the night, the apparently-dead
soap boilery emptied eight enormous “cops” out of a
side window, and a fearful rush of hoofs behind them
woke the absorbed school from its studies. “YOW!”
shrieked a man like a rat, and instantly the school burst
and scattered as an egg bursts when it is hit by the
devil. They streamed away in all directions, and some of
the more terrified ran into Queensland, and decided to
stay there, so they took up land on the Darling Downs
under the Closer Settlement system. Churchgoers in
peaceful localities far distant from the scene of the raid
staggered and spilt their bymnbooks all over the street,
w'hen panting men fled past them in the dusk and shot
up side streets. The godly ones told each other, with
bated breath, that something immensely horrible had
happened, and that it was extremely doubtful if Mel-
bourne would ever see another dawn. But when Mon-
day s Argus arrived they found that all the excitement
was over the arrest of eleven very ordinary individuals
for throwing small change into the air and letting it fall
down again.
The length of the Law’s arm surprised a
Victorian the other day. One night in 1902 a
John Hop stopped two men driving a jinker down
Chapel-street, P’ran. In the cart were some
stolen property and a jemmy. One man was cap-
tured, and hasn’t quite finished his sentence yet;
the other escaped. He returned from S’Africa by
the Everton Grange, the other day, and hadn’t
touched the wharf before a’tec pleasantly asked
him to come to the watch-house and tell all
about the jemmy. The conversation ended up
with two years’ “hard.” .

“ Gentleman One ” writes
Even Justice Hood probably got some excitement out
of the last Melbourne Sessions; and, anyhow, he con-
siderably increased his acquaintance with notable
degenerates. The ill-regulated citizen who had “ aban-
doned ” his baby by handing it to a woman at the
Hippodrome, and who thereupon posed as an unsuccessful
seeker after toil and a victim to the slings and arrows of
rotten luck, was shown to have a—er—housekeeper, who
toiled hard, though dishonorably, to keep him in luxurious
ease. He was handed a well-deserved six months. A youth
of 17, whose lack of mental balance led him to indecently
assault a little girl, was ordered three months and a
whipping—which will probably have no better effect than
in other recent cases of similar mental derangement. A
contemptible bad-house loafer, convicted of assault
and robbery, was proffered the maximum sentence
of seven years, whereupon his . best girl, fell
in a faint on the floor of the court. Another
“limit” sentence of seven years was bestowed on
a housebreaker with a choice list of previous convic-
tions, who, as he left the dock, fervently assured his
Honor that he was “a nice cow.” A cheerful person
who had casually walked into a Flinders Lane warehouse
and annexed a suit of clothes, was passed five years’
hard.” This irresponsible offered the quaintest defence
on record. He said he had gone to the warehouse to get
a billet, and, being - assured that if he could conceal some
goods and take them to the manager, that official would
sack the negligent employee and take him on instead, he
immediately bestowed a suit under his coat, and
was on his way to the manager when the employee
bowled him out and upset the scheme. A humorless
jury sniffed at this original excuse. Thereupon he varied
his tale and assured Justice Hood that, having a fair
chance of acquiring a billet in three months’ time and
being afraid he would go “ on the beer” and do something
precipitous in the interval, he had snavelled the suit so
as to put himself out of harm’s way till October. He
thought “ three months ” would meet the case accurately.
He was a cheerful rascal, but his Honor, perceiving his
extended “ record,” grinned dourly and handed him five
years’ gaol. While the Law was thus rubbing things in
at one end of the city the fool honorariums at Fitzroy
were awarding seven days’“ hard ”to a seasoned petty
larcenist. “ What,” said the victim, “ only seven days!
Gor bless yer, gents. Shake ! ” And he padded up to the
Bench, intent on personally slobbering over the gentle-
honorariums. Justice Hood would probably have made
his sentence seven years, which is why the Law doesn’t
get as much respect as it should. It is too much like
Tatt.’s sweeps or a very cheap Belgian gun.
You can get plenty of variety in your
religious services in England. One Sunday last
month, a Sheffield pulpit was occupied by an ex-
racing tout, who preached against gambling, and
another by the ex-hangman Berry. What. Berry
preached against is not stated, but presumably it
was the wicked and ruinous vice of getting hanged.

A Maorilander named Pommeroy lias in-
vented a new explosive which threatens to
eclipse lyddite. So far, he has been able, to
demonstrate its effect with rifle bullets only,
and he shows the explosive force by filling
his paste into a hollow bored in the nose of the
bullet. Of course, a soft-nosed bullet, even with-
out any explosive in it, has a fearfully destructive
telescopic action ; but military and naval experts
who have seen the effects of Pommeroy’s paste
declare it to be something extra special in the
way of tearing the innards out of whatever it
strikes. The stuff is to be submitted to Admiral
Poore when that fire-eating shellback calls in at
Auckland to lead the Yankee fleet across the
Tasman Sea. A curious thing about the new
explosive is that it has no backward action, but
explodes every time in the direction the bullet is
travelling. The inventor claims that it is 100
times more powerful than lyddite, more effective
than gun cotton, and as cheap to make as black
powder. He also says he has fired it after letting
it lie in a bullet for five years, and found it just
as effective as when tired immediately upon
manufacture, and that it sets up no chemical
action to corrode the shells, as do other ex-
plosives.
From the Sheffield (England) Weekly
Telegraph (16/5/’08)
Sydney, like most other large colonial cities, is a very
cosmopolitan place, and has a population in which the
white man is outnumbered by swarms of aliens, Jews,
Chinese, Japanese, Arabians, negroes, etc. The Chinese
and Japanese are, for the most part, wealthy and respect-
able citizens, and are the proprietors of several firmly-
established businesses in the city—their occupations
ranging from huge banking houses to laundries and
market gardens. The Jew’s, on the other hand, who, it
should bestated, inno way resemble the high-caste Hebrews
one meets in England, are chiefly engaged in the ped-
dling trade, and several are frequently to be seen roam-
ing around the docks for the purpose of selling trashy
wares to the easily-deluded sailors.
To which The Bulletin replies helplessly :
Sheffield, like most other British cities, is a strongly
Freetrade place, and has a population in which the well-
to-do Briton is outnumbered by swarms of starving raga-
muffins, who are the scum of the earth. Anarchists,
Armenians, coolies, Mormons, and low-class Japanese
women, hold the positions of honor and trust in the
community. The Anarchists and Armenians are, for
the most part, wealthy and respected citizens,
and are the proprietors of several firmly-estab-
blished businesses in the city—their occupations ranging
from huge bomb factories to the conducting of weekly-
newspapers and egg farms. They also do ring-barking in
the principal streets, and drive the bullock-drays which
convey passengers and goods to Huddersfield. The
Japanese women, who in no way resemble the high-caste
Japanese women one meets in Northern Australia, are
frequently to be seen roaming around the docks for the
purpose of trading with the easily-deluded sailors, who
are mostly Irishmen from Jerusalem and belong to the
O’Moses family. The gates of Sheffield are always shut at
night for fear of attacks by the Arabian population of
Hexham.

In Melbourne County Court, t’other day,
a medical witness delighted the court loafers and
horrified the Judge by climbing into the witness
box in all the pomp and circumstance of wig and
gown. His Honor sternly commanded the volatile
apparition to go away and disrobe. It seems that
it is contempt to doll oneself up in imitation of a
barrister in a court of justice. The Law, although
supposed to be made for the public, is really made
for lawyers, therefore anyone impersonating a
lawyer on the Law’s own premises is a presump-
tuous person who must be promptly suppressed.

But the P.S. to this bank’s half-yearly report was the
most interesting part, and that was contained in the
chairman’s speech at the half-yearly meeting : “ It is
proposed that the capital be augmented by the issue of
20,000 new shares of £l2 10s. each, making the paid-up
capital £1,500,000, the shares to be allotted at par.”
These shares are to be paid for by equal quarterly instal-
ments on Sept. 30 next and thereafter, but shareholders
may pay up the whole £l2 10s. at once ; and the share-
holder who can borrow money at 5 or 6 per cent., and get
10 per cent, for it, isn’t likely to turn that offer down.
Also, the shareholder who can’t raise £l2 10s. on a share
that will then be worth probably £27, may take it as a
hint that his custom isn’t wanted. The new issue will
mean one new share for every five old ones. Thus, assum-
ing that you want a 5 per cent, investment, you can
afford to pay £27 10s. for the present shares, cum rights.
(That is, 10 shares=£27s. Two new shares = £25. Total
far 12, £3OO. Face value of the 12 will be. £l5O.
Ten per cent, on that will be £l5, which is
5 per cent, on the total of £300.) A purchase
at £3O 16s. Sd. will give 4£ per cent. ; a purchase at £35
will give 4 per cent. This calculation, however, disre-
gards the loss of (say) two months’ interest on the
amount paid to buy the rights, because the new shares
apparently can’t carry interest until the beginning of
October. This, however, as an average, means only six-
pence per share.
Eighteen months ago, when this bank issued
20,000 new shares, a premium of £2 10s. per share was
required, and the premium went to strengthen reserves.
Presuming that it is proposed to go on paying 10 per
cent., the departure from that good plan can only be
justified by a considerable strengthening of the internal
position of the bank. The table printed above shows how
profits have increased during the past six years; but in
order to justify the new issue of shares at par, the bank
must be assured that something like recent profits will be
maintained (it will take £75,000 a half-year to pay a 10
per cent, dividend on £1,500,000). If the management is
assured of that, then the actual profits of the past few
years of great prosperity must have been considerably
larger than the disclosed profits, and the balance must
have been applied to writing down doubtful assets—and
probably in some cases assets that are not doubtful.
Certainly there is another fact to consider. For several
years past this bank has maintained an extraordinarily
large proportion of liquid assets, which bring in a low
return. Twelve months ago the proportion was 52 per
cent. ; it is still 46 per cent. There appears to be, there-
fore, a large margin still for the extension of advance
business when it offers ; and the bank is certainly all the
better for going slow at a time of very high prices. Its
clients will genuinely want help much more later on ;
and on the whole it will be safer to give it then. This
shows in fact that they have lately begun to want it
more, or, at any rate, to get more of it

Partly, no doubt, on account of the increase of advances
and the reduction of unproductive coin (though, as
stated above, the position in that respect is still very
strong), the earnings have increased materially ; stated
on the basis of shareholders’ funds (capital and reserves)
they have lately moved like this :

Though the increase of capital practically amounts to a
bonus to the shareholders, it will also give greater pro-
tection to the creditors. At present the shareholders’
funds represent £1 for every £6 16s. of the public’s ; so
that even without the increase, the proportion of share-
holders’ funds is by no means extraordinarily small. It
looks doubtful whether the present increase of capital is
made primarily because the shareholders’ interest needs
strengthening. It will be all the better for being
strengthened, certainly, but the increase of dividend,
without increasing the rate above 10 per cent., was pro-
bably the chief end immediately aimed at.

“The directors, having given additional and careful
consideration to the ‘ Old Bank Advances,’are satisfied
that further provision will have to be made with respect
thereto,” says the official report which introduces the
published accounts. Yes: but when? It has been
obvious for many years past that there were losses that
hadn’t been provided for ; if not, then it was a most im-
proper thing for the bank to buy its own old deposits at a
discount. The thing must be done sooner or later, and
the longer it is delayed the longer will the bank labor
along under a handicap.
In 1895 the A. J.S. Bank had £1,052,487 of new
current accounts and about £175,000 of new fixed de-
posits : total £1,227,487. The total is now £1,544,869, a
growth of about £317,000 in 12£ years. In the same
period the Commercial of Sydney has increased its de-
posits from £9,276,192 to £15,986,387. The Commercial
of Australia made a most deplorable smash ; but it never
allowed the old wreckage to obscure the new business.
I! it couldn’t clean up the premises, it at least cleaned up
the balance-sheet. And note the result:—

The A.J.S. Bank has tried to pull itself together by stress-
ing the fact that all new liabilities (deposits, etc.) are a
first charge on all the assets, new and old. But, obvi-
ously, that plan hasn’t worked. Even under the most
favorable conditions it was practically impossible that it
could work to the extent of obviating further sacrifice of
capital. What it has done has been to sacrifice possible
profits as well.
When we reach that point, the further sacrifice
of capital, we probably reach one of the internal difficul-
ties of the bank. What capital? Nominally there is
£154,570 paid up. The subscribed capital is £547,301 ; so
the present shareholders are liable for £392,731. The
Board consists of shareholders’ directors and depositors’
directors. The shareholders’ directors very likely haven’t
been eager for a cleaning- up. A real cleaning up would
mean, not only the disappearance of the paid capital, but
also the calling up of the unpaid £392,731. If they could
get the yawning cavern in the accounts filled up by pour-
ing in a spoonful of profit now and then, so much the
better for them. Even a painfully slow recovery that
might take 50 years would be better for them than a pain-
ful death. Yet the capital ought to be wiped out. There
is no doubt whatever that it has been lost. The question
is whether it is not worth the while of the old depositors
to make some sacrifice, too, in order to put the concern
into a position to earn something decent. The other fellow
may not be entitled to earn anything ; but if it is
necessary to let him earn something in order to earn
something yourself, then it is good business to throw him
a bone.
There are three lots of old depositors repre-
sented by holders of inscribed 3J per cent, stock, inter-
minable except at bank’s option ; and “ B ” deposits (3
per cent.), one lot repayable in 1912 and the other lot in
1917. Outstanding, there are £796,805 of inscribed stock
and £2,965,992 of “ B ” deposits. After the 3 and 3J per
cent, has been paid, 5 per cent, of the balance must go to
the reserves ; then the shareholders can get 2s. per share
(1J per cent.); after that the old depositors must get
another 1 per cent, before shareholders can have any
more. Of course the shareholders have got nothing so
far, and have no hope of getting anything for years. The
old deposits are the real capital; the holders of the
inscribed stock and “B” deposits are the real share-
holders. Yet it is only the trifle left over after paying
interest on these that is called profit. The public looks
at this trifle —anything from £lOOO up to £lO,OO0 —and
passes by. That trifling profit seems to spell failure ;
and the public has less use for a failure in banking than
in most places. Yet by the simple process of turning
some of this old deposit money into capital, the whole
appearance of things could be altered.
Here, for practical purposes, is the A.J.S.
balance-sheet as it stands now

Those old advances are not all bad; there are pastoral
properties among them which have lately been good
assets. How much of the £1,942,854 should be written
off is at present unknown. Capital is now represented
by 155,790 shares, paid to £1 (except fora few instalments
in arrear). and liable for £2 10s. That money has been
lost. In view of what was said above, a reasonable way
out seems to be to call up another 10s., and then write
off £l. The shares are worth nothing now ; yet that
plan, while preserving that valuation, would allow share-
holders, by paying 10s., to still hold 10s. worth of interest
in the bank. What proportion of the old deposits should
be written of, and how much should be capitalised, de-
pends upon the valuation. If one-third were written off,
and one-third capitalised, it would allow £1,302,285 to be
written off old advances and £106,551 off premises.
Perhaps something less drastic than that would be
sufficient. It is true that both inscribed stock
and old deposits are at over 33J per cent, discount, but
that is partly because of the low rate of interest. British
Consols stand at £9O or so, not because Britain is only
o-ood for 18s. in the £, but because the interest is only 2£
per cent. If one-third of the old deposits were capitalised
it would be easily possible to put up the rate of interest
x per cent, on the balance and pay a 5 per cent, dividend.
Last half-year’s interest, on the amount owing at the end
of the term, was £58,434. Also there was £9OOB profit.
Total of the two, £67,442. Then
3J per cent, on “ B ” deposits • • £17,302
4 per cent, on J inscribed stock .. 5,321
5 per cent, on the 4 capitalised .. 31,356
Total, £53,979
That, of course, would mean a small sacrifice so far as
immediate return goes on the part of the old-deposit
holders. But it would come back in the shape of greater
security and in the prospects of sharing in future larger
profits; because the bank would then show a profit of
£44,819 for the half-year (that is, the difference between
the new interest payable on old deposits and the old
interest, plus the £9008) ; and business would certainly
flow more freely to a bank that showed £44,819 profit and
paid a 5 per cent, dividend.

Under the existing scheme, arranged by Premier
Kidston, three-fourths of the net profits go to the old
depositors. In the beginning of things—assuming that
things began when the Big Drunk ended—it was arranged
that” three-fourths of the deposits with which the
Government had tried to prop up the wobbling concern
should be paid back in five equal annual instalments from
1917 onwards, and meantime should carry 3J per cent. ;
the other one-fourth, carrying no interest, was to be paid
out of profits. As to private deposits, three-fourths were
represented by interminable deposit stock, also carrying
31 per cent. ; the other fourth was to be paid out of net
profits. Of these net profits the public was to get 50 per
cent, the Government 25 per cent., and 25 per cent, was
to go’ to reserves. That went on all right for some years,
and then two people began to see that the arrangement
was a pretty cold one for them. Premier Kidston
was one of the people; the shareholders were the
other people. Kidston saw that the scheme was
all right for the man who might be Treasurer in 1917-’22 ;
but it was no good to himself. It put no money in the till
in his day. As for the shareholders, they.saw' that when
50 per cent. w r as paid to one lot and 25 per cent, to each
of two other lots, there was nothing left for them, and no
prospect of anything in this generation. So the new'
scheme was fixed up. The bank agreed to give 16 p.ns.,
the last payable in or before 1921; in return, the bank
secured the Government’s banking business till that year,
and was entitled to pay shareholders a dividend of 3J per
cent, as soon as half the p.ns. had been met. And, to
make the public appreciate the scheme, private depositors
were to receive 75 per cent, of the net profits till their
little 25 per cent, of t>he old debt was wiped out. lhat is
how things stand at present.
And this is how the figures relating to the old
trouble stand_

Of the 16 p.ns. given to the State five»have been paid,
and so three more have to be paid before it will be pos-
sible for the shareholders to get a dividend ; and even
then the private depositors must get 75 per cent, of the
net profits. So far, an average of very nearly half of the
gross profits have been written off ; and nobody knows.
how long that policy will continue. Supposing, however,
that £40,000 a year were paid off the debt to the private
depositors, it would still be 21 years before it would be
wholly extinguished ; and until it is wholly extinguished
only 25 per cent, can go to shareholders, and the
dividend may not go past 3£ per cent. Of course
net profits may not stop at £53,333 6s. Bd. a year
(£40,000 would be three-fourths of that). The Bank of
Adelaide makes a net £55,000 a year or more with assets
totalling only £4,300,000; and the Q.N.’s assets total
£8,408,422. The National Bank of Maoriland last year
made £87,401 w’ith assets amounting to £5,201.862. In
the latter half of 1885 (that was before the Drunk started
in earnest), the Q.N. itself said it made £52,000, with
assets of £6,576,000. Even allowing, then, that a good
deal of the present £8,408,422 is non-existent—allowing
that it ought to be reduced by one-fourth or one-third—
there is still room to hope for a more speedy clearing off
of the old debt. There is, however, another considera-
tion. While that old debt exists it costs the bank
nothing; and directors probably won’t rush to pay off
debt which costs them nothing, in order that they may
be in a position to pay larger dividends than 3J p.d.,
only to find out that, instead of paying bigger dividends,
there are still a lot of old losses to write off out of
Consequently the chances are that a very large sum will
for many years to come be written off, even though that
delays the clearing-off of the debt to private depositors,
and thus prevents the increase of dividend beyond 3£ per
cent. The shares are £3paid, with a£2liability. Worth
practically nothing five years ag'o, t hey have steadily
crept up to 255. They are a gamble, of course: the
alluring part about them is that there are now only
153,391 live shares among which to cut up possible future
profits.

Besides the advances mentioned above there are the
“ private ledger accounts ” shown as “ debts due to bank”
in a previous comparison. There has been a large in-
crease of advances during the year. Yet probably those
figures don’t show all; for there have no doubt been con-
siderable realisations too, so the new business secured
may be larger than the net figures above indi-
cate. The liquid assets represent no less than
58 per cent, of the new deposits and the bills, etc. ;
and even if some regard should be paid to the outstand-
ing p.ns. given to the Government (though the nearestone
is dated five years hence), that position is very strong. It
was a frightful bog that the bank got into ; but Queens-
lanp has stuck to the Q.N. in a noteworthy fashion. One
proof of that is that the new private deposits are now 5J
times greater than the capital, and the proportion is in-
creasing ; and, given reasonably fair conditions up North,
that generous aid will make possible a recovery which
seemed almost too desperate at one time to even hope for.

After a long delay, this bank had a final cleaning-up in
1904. Things had not then quite recovered in Australia
after the big drought, and the valuations were fairly low
in consequence ; also, of course, the writing-down was
correspondingly severe. As shown above, £719,151 was
wiped out. There were 111,731 preference shares paid in
money to £5. In the reconstructed co. two lots of shares
were issued against these —111,731 preference 30s. shares ;
the same number of deferred preference shares of ss.
The ordinarv shares stood for £351,324 ; these were cut
down to £3406, in shares of Is. each. The preference
shares were to carry 5 per cent. ; the other shares were to
participate in anything over that. Surpluses realised
from the sale of written-down assets were to be put to a
special reserve for the benefit of the deferred preference
and the ordinary shares. As said just now, the valuations
were made at a dull time, so the recoveries have been
fairly substantial. This shows the transactions :

Note that the second column shows profit on sales “ com-
pleted.” Many of the transactions are on terms ; the
directors report that it is only when the last payment is
made that credit is taken for any surplus. Also “ where
a portion only of an asset has been realised the amount of
the purchase money has been credited to the account,
and the balance of the security has not been re-valued,
nor has the estimated surplus [on that transaction] been
transferred to the reserve fund.” The actual amount of
property (book value) which has given the surplus of
£18,814 is, therefore, not disclosed. The figures as written
down were first published for the half-year to June, 1905.
This is how they compare with present figures

One trouble is that the deposits don’t increase, wherefore
the bank’s capacity for taking new business is very
limited. There has been an increase in the advances,
certainly, but only out of the proceeds of sales ; and that
is a slow business, especially when they are time-
payment sales. And yet the security looks all right.
The deposits not represented by liquid assets total
£292,126; and against that there are the advances,
balances owing, and properties shown above, totalling
£520,485, and the great bulk of these assets were written
down to the 1904 level.

Premises, etc. .. 9,272 5,555 4,375
In a year the deposits have increased £4767, and in 10
years, £29,312 ; while advances have increased £1773 in
one year, and £36,847 in ten. But the improvement has
apparently been greater than the figures would signify ;
for the gross earnings were £7060, or at the rate of
£5 2s. 6d. per cent, per annum on the advances 10
years ago, while they are now £9106, or at the rate of
£5 15s. 6d. per cent. It looks, therefore, as though there
were a more profitable class of business on the books
nowadays. Still, in a district as rich as that which
surrounds Ballarat, the improvement in the figures ought
to be much greater, in spite of the shrinkage in the local
gold-mining business. The trouble is the old one —while
the district is rich it isn’t used. The bank’s net earnings
are comparatively small ; profits, calculated on capital
and reserves combined, have lately been as follows:
Dec., 1904 ..£5 5 4 p.c. Dec., 1906 ... £5 6 1 p.c.
June, 1905 .. 5 6 1 „ June, 1907 .. 5 6 1 „
Dec., 1905 5 5 8 „ Dec., 1907 .. 5 2 2 „
June,l9o6 .. 5 5 2 ~ June, 1908 ..5 2 8 „
This comparatively poor return is partly due to the fact
that the bank works very largely on its own funds ; for
every £1 of its own it has, the use of less than £1 11s. of
the public’s money. And, since all its business is done
at one office in one town, it probably finds it prudent to
maintain a strong cash position, and that also necessarilv
reduces immediate profits a little. Liquid assets there-
fore represent as much as 35 per cent, of all debts to the
public, notwithstanding that nearly seven-eighths of the
deposits are fixed. There is nothing very gaudy in the
business for shareholders ; on the other hand, the small
proportion of public money employed reduces share-
holders’ risks. And also, of course, it reduces the de-
positors’ risk, since the non-liquid securities would
actually have to fall more than 10s. in the £ below book-
values before the depositors’money would be in jeopardy.

This co. was born in 1888 ; and that wasn’t a good time
to arrive in Queensland if you had more money than ex-
perience. Consequently the disaster of the early nineties
hit it, like it hit most of the rest of Queensland, and its
dividends were down to 2J- per cent, for some time. The
foregoing list opens with 1898, and even by that year the
co. had only been able to crawl up to 4 per cent., and its
reserves were still insig'nificant. Since then things have
improved gradually ; but the profits have never allowed
any such gorgeous additions to reserves as some southern
trustee cos. have made. From one point of view there
was less call for them ; for in proportion to the estates in
hand, the paid capital is large; that is to say, the
guarantee offered by the co. to clients is substantial. It
is only during the last three years that the value of the
trust estates in hand has been disclosed. In 1906, the
total was £1,408,236. For the last two years the figures
(along with some others) will be found in this com-
parison 1898> 1.902. 1907. 1908.

It will be seen that the estates in hand are less than they
were 12 months ago. This, however, doesn’t mean that
things are going the wrong way with this co. : it means,
no doubt, that owing to Queensland’s rush of prosperity
it was easier to sell properties and wind up estates than
it had been for many years—probably ever since 1891.
The cost of management, etc., is rather high; but
Queensland is a place of big distances, and that neces-
sarily means expenses. The assets are an unusually good
lot ‘ £24 600 is in Government debentures and bills, and
of the balance £3139 was at the bank on June 30, and
£4928 was represented by advances. Except that one
southern trustee office has a Queensland branch, the
Queensland Trustees, Ltd., has the Northern State to
itself; and, though a good many northerners have the bad
habit of retiring to spend their fortunes among the
southern fleshpots, there ought still to be an excellent
future for this co.

In the calculation of working costs in concen-
trating mills and workshops, every small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. . Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the'Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
with the best solid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
than with babbit metal journals. Messrs. W. and J.
Lempriere, 506 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, will be
glad to supply further information to those interested.*

A copper smelting furnace, designed to embody
the recommendations of the best Australian and American
experts, has just been constructed for the Great Fitzroy
Gold and Copper Mines Ltd., Queensland. The furnace is
of large capacity, being capable of turning out 100 tons of
matte per day. It is rectangular in shape, and is higher
in column in proportion to its hearth area than is
customary. By this means both the roasting and
oxidisi ng operations will be conducted in the same furnace,
the oxidising being done in the upper portion and the
smelting in the lower. The furnace has two tiers of mild
steel water jackets. The lower tier rests on a c.i. plate,
supported on c.i. standards, or, should hearth plate be
removed, the tier will be swung on girders ; the upper
tier of jackets is always swung from girders supported on
columns. The columns are held together by a strong c.i.
frame. The air blast passes from a pipe encompassing
the furnace through Hustle pipes to the tuyeres. The
Austral Otis Engineering Company, South Melbourne,
have designed and built this furnace.* [1

Engineers have not been slow to recognise the
sterling merits of Holmes’ Metallic Packing, which has
been introduced into the Australian market by Gibson,
Battle and Co., Ltd., 7 Bent Street, Sydney; and 128
William Street, Melbourne. This packing works success-
fully on all types of engines, and being of the same
material as piston rings and cylinder of the engine, fitting
close to the rod and partaking of its motion, it possesses
a marvellous wearing quality, lasting even up to 15 3'ears.
At the same time it is almost frictionless, and does not
wear, cut, or score the rod.*

The official explanation of the £2300 drop in the
Perseverance (W.A.) return for May was as follows:
“ Actual extraction £3OOO behind theoretical extraction
during April; expected to recover difference during last
month ; on this account ore treated was below the
average grade of ore in reserve ; decrease in output due
to having failed to obtain difference, contrary to antici-
pation.” But how is it that the June return is nearly
£lOOO below that for May ? Is the actual value of the ore
behind the theoretical value also ? It certainly looks
like it.

Report of Chaffers Co. (W.A.) for 15 months
ended December 31 last mentions that the expenditure for
that period only amounted to £4925, and that when the
books closed the available cash resources totalled £32,037.
At the shareholders’ meeting held in London on June 15,
chairman Lewis Aarons claimed that, in view of rich de-
velopments in the Great Boulder at 2200 ft., and the
admitted value of the Horseshoe and Ivanhoe at depth,
the Board was quite justified in playing a waiting game
and keeping a tight hold of the cash instead of liquidat-
ing and making a division. Some time ago, negotiations
were opened for the amalgamation of Chaffers and other
cos. holding adjoining leases, but so far without result.

Great Ophir (W.A.) held a scratch meeting in
Adelaide, the other day, when Director Bodway, with
over 100,000 shares behind him, carried a resolution for
the further reconstruction of the co. on the basis of
320,000 shares at 2s. each ; but, as the concern is already
mortgaged up to its hair-roots, and as the vague tale
about a little more money being required to earn divi-
dends is played out, those who are asked to subscribe
further capital ought to proceed very warily, and should
require something definite in the way of reports and
estimates from independent experts.

A. E. Morgans turned up at Morgans (W.A.)
the other da}' and gave the downcast townspeople a ray
of hope as to the Westralia mine. Gold worth a million
and a quarter sterling was taken out of this property, and
then an intrusion cut off values just below 300 ft. Over
£40,000 has since been spent in trying to locate the
missing shoot, but without success. Still, Morgans con-
tinues breezy and hopeful, and begs others to be the
same.

The assets of the Birrigrin Co. (W.A.) were
auctioned by authority of the liquidator the other day.
Only a few lots were disposed of; and unless the balance
of the plant can be got rid of at a fair price, registered
shareholders may have to make*up a little.
* * * »
Whim Well shareholders (W.A.) roust surely
realise by this time that they have been reading a good
deal of fiction about their property. The past year’s re-
ports alleged, among other gaudy things, that there were
hundreds and thousands of tons of 10 per cent, ore in
sight, and that with a smelter a yearly profit of £61,000
could be earned without turning a hair. Now the Perth
Herald and other papers which were praising the show
at the time The Bulletin was questioning the exag-
gerated statements, have discovered that the best stuff
has been taken out, and that what is left is not as good as
reported. The co. is now on its financial uppers, and as
a drill imported five months ago with a great noise to
prove the copper deposits at depth has never been
erected, it looks as if the management were not too anxious
to go down deep into the property.
Ida H. (W.A.) reports that the production of
gold for 1907 amounted to 10,2200 z., valued at £39,569 ;
and this, added to revenue derived from other sources,
made the total receipts £39,873. After providing for all
costs and charges, the net profit is given as £1215. At
present the lode is furnishing fair values at 600 ft., and
the pay-shoot is about the same size as in the higher levels ;
while all the way down the winze, about 60ft. below the
600 ft. level, the ore is worth 16dwt. for a width of 20in.
This reads fairly well, but in reality the condition of the
mine is critical, the margin between receipts and outlay
being very narrow.
Tin output from Pilbarra (W.A.) for June is
valued at £2554, which is a big fall from the monthly
figures of a little while ago. Exceptionally wet weather,
and the consequent inability of dryblowers to get to work,
is the excuse put forward for the drop. As a matter of
fact, three tons of tin are now worth only as much as
two tons were worth during a good part of 1906. The
average for 1906 was, £lBO 17s. 6d., and for 1907 £172 16s.
sd. ; while at present the market is wobbling between
£l3O and £l4O. But even that is a very fine price. In
1898 the average was only £7l 4s. 7d.

The Fenian, at Meekatharra (W.A.),.has just
added another £lO,OOO to its gold output. Hitherto the
ore has been treated at the State mill, but in future it
will be put through the owners’ own plant.
A full-page prospectus of the Cue No. 1 (W.A.)
was recently published in the leading papers of Paris and
Greece by Tindal’s Development Co., which is engineer-
ing the float. The fact that £40,000 has already been
spent on the property, and that the vendors—two Cue
mining men—are taking shares instead of cash, is made
the most of in the advt.; but as money already expended
counts for very little in this case, and as the nominal
capital of the proposed co. (£450,000) is ridiculously high,
M. Lobsteropoulos had better sniff twice before he bites
once.

Victorian mining is in such a tangle that the
Bent Government proposes to hypothecate £lOO,OOO to
straighten it up. This proposal arises out of the trouble
deep lead ditches have been to London market steeple-
chasers. Here is 8., M. and Co.’s list: —
Australian Commonwealth Trust .. .. £125,000
Consolidated Deep Leads .. .. .. 198,000
Australian Deep Leads .. .. .. 69,000
Berry United 50,000
Loddon Valley .. .. 168,000
Moolort Goldfields .. .. .. .. 115,000
Victorian Deep Leads.. .. .. .. 132,000
Prentice and Southern Deep Leads .. 50,000
Total capital .. .. £907,000
8., M. and Co.’s list does not include the Great Northern
Extended Consols, Great Southern Consols, Wallace Con-
sols, Great Southern No. 1 (Butherglen); Spring Hill Leads
(Creswick); and Duke United, Burnt Creek, Duke and
Main Leads Consols, and Chalk’s 3 (Maryborough). Yet
all these, too, show heavy debit balances. The total of
capital gone can be put down as at least £2,500,000. With
this ocean of waste, it is presumption for Bent’s crowd to
think that £lOO,OOO split up among alluvial and quartz
mines is to save the whole situation. What it may do is
to help some speculators in picking a few more feathers
from that much-plucked bird, the public. This will cer-
tainly be the case with the quartz mining grants unless
the Government insists on the pooling of scrip in safe
hands until the work is done.
* * * *
The balance-sheets of Spring Hill Leads
(Creswick) and Burnt Creek (Maryborough) come out
opportunely, in view of the proposed Bent grant to
mining. Spring Hill Leads’ capital outflow has been
£114,666 ; gold won, £121,722 ; dividends, nil. Burnt
Creek: Capital called, £56,627 ; gold won, £160,000;
dividends, £12,000. These are shows that deserve aid.
Spring Hill Leads found that the bottom was out of the
gutter owing to a big subsidence near by, after a volcanic
eruption. Only enough gold was left in the high reef
and in patches to induce people to pay calls. Burnt
Creek has had low-grade dirt and heavy water, so the
best management in the State couldn’t do more than
make ends meet. Though things look a bit more cheer-
ful for both mines, the hope of getting back their capital
is remote.
* * * *
Duke and Main Leads Consols, Maryborough,
gets a cheap run in the Argus mining column. Thus:
“The splendid return of gold from the small number of
parties blocking out wash is centreing great attention on
the possibilities of the mine becoming one of the soundest
investments that has been presented to shareholders in
alluvial mining for very many years, and it is confidently
expected within the next few months the co.’s operations
will be instrumental in creating a revival in other mines
by the consistent flow of increased fortnightly yields.”
As to that hifalutin these remarks seem called for:
(1) Wash from drives is not a proof that the same good
gold will be won when panelling is carried on, else the
Main Leads would have been a 25dwt. show, and Spring
Hill Leads a 2oz. show. (2) Good preliminary yields must
be judged from the same standpoint. (3) Main Leads
North run of wash was often very narrow, and there isn’t
any evidence to show that it has changed its nature
where now worked from No. 2 shaft. (4) The Duke lead
is patchy.

■P. N. Tewksbury, having conquered Bright
(Vic.) as a dredging centre, has strolled into the camp of
the agricultural enemy, having taken up 2000 acres for
dredging at Wangaratta. Besidents there may be ex-
pected to promptly sool the Sludge Abatement Board on
to the pioneer of this new Wangaratta industry. Tewks-
bury does not sit still, for he and his political pals have just
got rid of their Braidwood (N.S.W.) dredging area of 1000
acres under the name of the Tewksbury Proprietary
Dredges. As “Tewks ” and his friends take 25,000 shares,
paid up to £l, out of an issue of 70,000, they don’t do badly.
Still, if the truth were known, they may be finding the
bulk of the cash, for the Victorian public views mining
to-day with a lack-lustre eye.
* * * *
A chief characteristic of Broken Hill Block 10
ore at depth is a provoking fineness of grain, rendering
sliming easy, and milling proportionately difficult. At
the bottom level—l46sft.—the ore body has disclosed
another unpleasant feature. It contains more ingredients
than a Yankee cocktail ; for, besides the silver, lead, and
zinc, there is an unfair proportion of rhodonite, quartzite
and garnet sandstone —things the mill doesn’t like.
Another source of worry in connection with the opening
up of the lode is that there is, so far, no sign of a decent
hanging wall. What represents the hanging wall is
poorly mineralised ground, quite different from what was
found at the level above. The north end of this lode is
the future hope of the management, because where it
pitches into the mine from Block 11 it is wider and of
much better quality than it is southward. The inference
is that as the body is driven on northwards, better mill-
ing ore will be met with.
* * * *
The Pinnacles mine, a few miles outside Broken
Hill, hasn’t had a fair chance, in spite of its age ; but it
is about to resume operations under a new proprietary.
The mine has been fearfully knocked about in recent years,
but there is plenty of good ore there still. The last co.
frittered its money away in toying with the Elmore pro-
cess, and in the end found the thing wouldn’t work.
Why the process failed in this particular instance is a
matter of opinion. Some say it was because the Pin-
nacles ore is too heavily mineralised, and that is pro-
bably pretty near the mark. Others say that the pre-
liminary crushing was at fault. Anyway, it failed ; so
when the mine starts producing again it will be with a
wet concentration mill.

With electrolytic copper quoted from London

Briseis (Tas.), with tin at £133 10s., made
£20,000 during the March quarter, or £5OOO above what is
needed to pay the 6d. div. for the term. The net price
obtained during 1907 for tin was £166, and in 1906, £lB4 ;
so there has been a drop of £5O between 1906 and
the March quarter of this year. The full accounts
for 1907 arrived lately from London. They show
how closely averages are managed ; the 1907 output
of metallic tin was 910 tons, or only two tons less than in
1906. But with a drop of £lB in tin, the trading profit
fell from £128,557 to £109,219. This did not bring down
mine expenses, which ate up £32,168, against £30,168.
Melbourne office suffered, there being a lopping down
from £1733 to £1341. London’s appetite for the loaves
and fishes, however, meant the disappearance of £2771
in expenses there.
J. Bull knows how to finance mines in some
respects, so all the expenditure on the Bingarooma is
ruled out and another £7014 goes off the cost of the head
race. The depreciation written off in connection with
these two assets for the last two years represents
£26,000. At the end of the year the co. had a reserve of
£20,000 invested in Consols, and, besides, cash assets
worth £39,651, against which it owed to sundry creditors,
£3,350. Therefore, there is very little risk in accepting
the view that the co. can pay 6d. divs. and open up the
Bingarooma mine.
* * * *
Tasmanian West Ooast mining is still in a state
of slump. There are three main causes, all related to
one another : (1) the fall in the value of metals ; (2)
Senator Clemons’ successful efforts in getting the zinc-
lead cos. to combine against the charges levied on their
ores by the Zeehan Smelting Co. ; (3) the strikes en-
gineered by the directors of mining cos. for the sake of
causing a suspension of their contracts to supply the
various smelting cos. with ore. But despite these
troubles, magnified by some into mountainous obstruc-
tions, and debited mostly against the A.M.A., the dis-
trict still shows some gleams. For instance, this
announcement: “The directors of the Mount Bischoff
T. M. Co. have declared the 376th div. of ss. per share.. .
The amount of the dividend is £3OOO, which .brings the
total paid by the co. up to £2,442,000, or £l7B 15s. per
share.” There are 12,000 shares of £5 in the co.,
but the shareholders have only put up £7600.
Dividends have been paid monthly for about 30
years, up to as much as £1 per share. The Mt.
Lyell Co. has also paid over two millions sterling
in divs. in some 10 years. That amount was rrot on a
trifle of £7600, but on over £750,000 subscribed by the old
co. plus the amount subscribed by the shareholders of
the North Lyell Co. The little old tin mine with the
alien name still holds the record for big profits on small
outlay, and quick and regular returns. Bischoff shares
have been sold up to £lO5, and now command over £33.
* * * *
Charters Towers is simmering down. It sees
that a good deal depends on the length of the shoot in
the N. B. Freehold, which has yet to be proved. Twice
already the reef has become broken up and carried less
mineral. No. 8, which is 126 ft. on the incline below No. 7,
has been driven more than 50ft. on low-grade stone.
With the upper level for a guide, they certainly did not
expect to get the enrichment near the boundary. A
fairly solid reef is being followed, which is a good sign.
Giving full value to recent developments, it will take
several months to sink the shaft and develop the mine ;
so dividends cannot be expected for some time to come.
The E. Mexican is even more anticipatory, although driv-
ing in from the upper levels in Mills’ United may prove
something ; yet it is only expectation, based on develop-
ment in the adjoining mines, that is holding up £.
Mexican shares. The gamble three years ago was based
on the same kind of hope.
■* * * *
Brilliant Extended, Charters Towers, crushed for
the month 3985 tons for £8927, which should give a profit
of over £lOOO to reduce the overdraft. The underlie a
few feet below the deepest levels carries heavy mineral
stone, and the level itself has been driven west on sft. of
good mineral stone. The level above (No. 16) is looking
well, which accounts for the improvement in the crushing.
The Extended will probably make its mark early ; but, so
far as future distributions are concerned, it should be
remembered that there are a quarter of a million
shares, and although the reef is sometimes wide the
shoots of payable stone are not long.
* * * *
Better times at Charters Towers are responsible
for the attention which some of the smaller shows are
attracting. Among these are the Blue Peter, about 12
miles out, which has a Ift. reef worth £5 per ton, and the
Milchester, which is being reconstructed as the Identity
Gold Mine, with 48,000 ss. shares, half fully paid. Here
the reef is also about a foot wide, well mineralised.
* * * *
Stanthorpe (Q.), which, until recently, was
rather old-fashioned in its methods, begins to see the ad-
vantages of up-to-date plants for handling both copper
and tin ores. The Warroo copper and gold mine is being
developed on sound lines, and, with 2ft. of good ore in
both eastern and western levels, should give a good
account of itself as soon as the furnace is com-
pleted. Some ore from this property carries as much as
3oz. gold, and 9 percent, copper ore has been broken.
Tin mining generally is dull, in many instances due to
shortage of water. Prospecting still continues; the
latest development is at Dalcoath Flat (108 acres), where
a test of 289 bores proved 12ft. of wash, 7 chains wide,
averaging nearly 21b. per cub. yard—just about the gene-
ral average of the wash on the field. A new co. is being
formed to put in a good plant. Paddock Swamp Co.
cleaned up a four days’ run recently for 30cwt. tin. This
co. has 120 acres proved tin-bearing country in a claim of
320 acres freehold, held by the co. on a 15 years’ lease.
The wash is a little better than Dalcoath’s. This is being
worked on up-to-date lines.
* * * *
Some time ago a daily-paper writer advocated
the working of O.K. (North Queensland) as an open
cut, and was promptly laughed to scorn. Nevertheless,
development in that direction is giving good results.
The ore body in the open cut has been exposed for a
height of 30ft., showing 15ft. of 8 per cent, carbonate ore,
with more to follow. The mine is looking better all
round, and the later developments at the gully shaft and
Northern lease should more than compensate for the
depletion of the main stopes. Beturns from the smelters
continue up to 8 per cent, recovery, with practically un-
interrupted smelting; and the set-back which shares
suffered on account of impending law troubles has given
place to normal conditions.
r * * * *
East Oriental and G-lanmire, Gympie, is on a
run of specimen stone, which accounts for a crushing of
1440 tons for IOSOoz. The ore-body is large and situated
within easy distance of the shaft, so mining costs are only
10s. 2d., arid total expenses run to about £1 a ton. No. 2
S. Great Eastern has £3OOO on fixed deposit, and has im-
proved prospects ; but the fact that it has been negoti-
ating with the East Oriental to haul the stone with a
traction engine, and crush at the latter co.’s fine milling
plant, tells its own tale.

“ The Optimist” : Is there any richer or more
extensive mineral field on the face of the earth than Olon-
curry (Q.)? From Mt. Oxide in the north to Mt. Birnie
and Trikelana in the south—the extent of the mineral
country certainly cannot be disputed. As to its richness,
the quality of the surface ore has, to a great extent, in-
terfered with proper prospecting. The ore is so good on
top that the idea of good copper underneath seems too
magnificent to he true. This is practically the method of
reasoning adopted by hostile critics. Now let us see how
it works out. The Macgregor, with about 200 ft. of sink-
ing, has vastly improved its prospects. The same at Mt.
Cuthbert: there they lately struck a heavy flow of water,
which will ultimately be of the greatest importance in
working the mine. Developments at the Duchess have
exposed a remarkably rich copper lode. At the Great
Australian the apparent value of the property has been
doubled during the last few months by the prospects re-
vealed in the deeper levels. Finally, at Mt. Elliott the
300 ft. level exceeds all expectations. The copper quality
of the ore is well maintained, and for gold it lately assays
anywhere from sdwt. to 4oz. to the ton.
* * * *
That part of North Queensland that depends on
mining is in a sorry plight. The fall in metals has
extinguished the prospector, and all but a very few of
the stronger cos. have been flattened out. Garnet Sluice
Go.’s property has been let to tributors. Zillmanton is
shut down, also Bedeap and Chillagoe Consols. Smith’s
Creek is at its last gasp, and a strike has happened on the
Georgetown railway line. Where but the other day there
was talk of booms and floats, they now whisper of hard
times and bankruptcy.
* * * *
Copper statistics have shown an enormous ex-
pansion of late years. Aaron Hirsch & Son’s estimate of
the world’s consumption is 787,564 metric tons for 1907 ;
and production fell short of that vast total by only
34,664 tons. Allowing a few thousand tons for loss, the
world is stocking copper in the manufactured state at an
extraordinary rate. The statistical position is that the
consumption of copper increases on the average 5 p.c. per
annum, and a threatening picture of short supplies and
high prices is deduced from the cumulative effect of a
5 p.c. rate of increase. But statistics take no heed of the
enormous accumulation of copper in the manufactured
state, and the consequent increase in the quantity of old
metal placed on the market. The real danger of the
copper situation is that a few mines—certainly not more
than 20—produce at least two-thirds of the copper. Ger-
many has one big show, Spain has the Bio Tinto, North
and South America a few very, big concerns, Australia has
Mount Morgan and Mount Lyell, and Japan has one big
mine. The idea that America can do as it likes with the
market because it produces half the world’s supply is not
sustained. Consumption is much greater outside of
America than inside it, so the demand and consequently
the price is influenced by European trade.

“ Lantana ”: Yet again has the utter
absurdity of wearing whiskers been demonstrated.
At Bendigo, t’other night, a Mr. Ross was reading
before the fire in his home. Ross has been noted
for years as the cultivator of a luxurious growth of
face-herbage. A vagrant spark hit his chin wheat.
It burst into flames. The scene that followed
recalled in appalling fashion the worst days of the
last Gippsland bush fires. The house was gutted
and burnt to the ground, and Ross rushed in a
whiskerless and distraught state into the street,
smelling like a burning-off contract. His lip-
canopy will not wave as of yore for some years.
ARGUING IN A CIRCLE.
PARSON : “ You’re so poor because you 're drunk

DRUNK: “ Yer wrong, guv'nor (hie); I'm only

“J.E.” (Clermont): lie “ Mopane’s ”
inquiry (B. 16/7/’08) as to long rides on one horse.
About 10 years ago Billy jKiely, proprietor of a
tavern in Stonehenge (Western Queensland), rode
from that place to Longreach, distant just 100
miles, in 12 hours. The rider (since defunct) was
a tidy chunk of humanity, weighing, with saddle
up, 16 stone. His mount was a common-bred
stock mare standing about 15.2, and is still in the
possession of Billy’s relations, who continue to
keep the pub whence the old man started on his
protracted trail.
Goril : I have a craving to drop a
terrace of bricks on the kauri pate of “ Maori-
(®- 16/7/’08). After insinuating that
Gross Nibs ’ is a “pernicious liar,” on the
strength of his alleged 500yds. pig sprint, “Maori-
lander writes : “ If, on the other hand, a pig can
be kept going for 100yds., or more, it gets winded,
and is incapable of flight or pursuit.” Should the
or more” be a saving clause implying anything
up to 10 miles, “Maorilander” may be 0.K., but
if it means “within a reasonable distance” —as
i7iwr° r ' Vol dd say—of 100yds., then I declare
Maorilander ” to be fully qualified for the pillar-
of-salt stakes, and Ananias to be his prototype.
Just imagine what a wooden-legged show a boar-
hunt would pan out if the tusker had to sit down
for a smoke and rest every 100yds. Has “ Maori-
lander ’ never taken part in the popular sport of
chasing the greasy pig ? ” I,have, and can vouch
that on one occasion for at least 20min. you
couldn’t see the pig’s curly tail for dust as its feet
ate up the landscape, with a pack of swift long-
distance “peds”in its wake. It covered miles,
and didn’t sit down for refreshment once.
A landowner at Peak Hill (N.S.W.) alleges
that he has completely cleared a paddock of
rabbits by stuffing old newspapers into the mouths
of the burrows. The crinkly, rustling substance
so scares the bunny within that he doesn’t break
his way out —just stays in and dies. But the old
left-off copy of GbaNnt isn’t likely to be a per-
manent cure for the bunny evil. The animal
must learn in time that the enemy is harmless,
and when he realises that he will tear it up and
use it as a spring bed for bunny junior.

“Agricola”: The laughing jackass is a
bird without any sense of humor, and his name is
altogether misleading. In this par., therefore, I
will allude to him simply as a goburra. No bird
gets his dignity dinted-in quicker, and no bird
takes longer to come round again. A boy with a
catapult delights in taking rises out of
him. From safe cover among some
bushes, he sends a white pebble bump-
ing and bouncing along under the
tree where the goburra is pensively
waiting. The innocent bird mistakes
the pebble for a bounding grass-
hopper, or an excited spider, and
dives after it in seven sorts of a
hurry. Having caught up to it, he
kills it rapidly thrice, and then
carrying it up to the tree, he slays
it thrice more. Then he partially
swallows it, and, becoming suspicious,
spies it out for investigation. He puzzles
over it for a bit, and thinks his eyesight
isn’t what it used to be. Meanwhile, he
wonders where that lively insect got to, and
just then the boy skips another pebble
along. The killing performance is repeated
with more energy than before, and ends with
more disgust. At the third have, he begins
to think someone is putting up a game on
him, and sulks. The boy pokes borak at him,
and he sulks all the harder. I once split
open a boy—l mean a log—full of wood-grubs,
for a goburra that was outraged in this
manner, but he absolutely refused to come
and partake. He was wounded to the very core.
“ Harry ” (and, right here and hereafter,
“ Harry ” stands for Henry Lawson, Henrik
Hertzberg Larsen, “Joe Swallow,” “Cervus
Wright,” or any old pen-name I wrote under or
above ; so my friends will have no difficulty in
weeding out the crop of yarns re identity that
shall surely spring up after lam sown): Speaking
of the 11,000 railway sleepers from New South
Wales recently condemned in South Africa,
Sydney D.T. goes on to say that “of course the
timber would be knocked about in transit; but,
for some reason unknown, apparently the whole
shipment was condemned.” The News also
maunders about careless stowage, and vaguely
suggests a Royal Commission generally. (Doodle
Doo !) Knocked about in transit ! ye gods ! And
of such are our journalists, and such is our daily
press. In the case of good honest hardwood Aus-
tralian sleepers, the only damage, if any, in
transit, would be found in the inner skin or frame
of the ship’s hold that carried them —provided
there was any hold left after a rough passage.
My respected grandfather would probably be able
to throw some light on the subject, for the old gen-
tleman has knocked many thousands of fairly good
shingles, palings, and posts and rails out of moun-
tain ash in his time, to say nothing of less likely
trees.

“ Grip ” : Yet another astonishing pig has
come my way. Lft is quite an ordinary-looking
black pig, but his affection for a common brown
sort of horse is unique. In his fervor he follows
the gee-gee over miles of rough country, and on
the day when I first met him he was belting
across the plain, apparently in hot pursuit of
nothing. Near the woolshed, however, he pulled
up, sniffing the air, and worriedly glancing this
way and that. A horse neighed, and with a
satisfied grunt the pig again broke into a gallop,
and, making straight for the shed, fell, slightly
fatigued, between the legs of his tethered friend.
The owner of both animals assured me that the pig
had followed the horse over the seven long mile 3
dividing his home from the station, and later on
would follow the seven longer miles back again.
“And he ain’t in too bad nick either,” as an
astonished listener observed.
BUSHY .
“ Begdbs, an it’s a fine head of hair yer horse has on its tail!"
“ Moorabindai ” about two men now dead :
Apropos of “ Karl's ” par (B. 18/6/’08), in which he
states that old Tom Boyd " spoke as highly of Hovell as
of Hume, and darkly hinted that their quarrel arose
through land matters,” “ Karl ” is partly, but not wholly,
correct. The great ill-feeling which existed between
Hovell and Hamilton Hume, and which caused the two
explorers to be like unto ye ancient feudal monarchs,
originated out of a quarrel over an ordinary common or
kitchen frying-pan on their overland trip from Sydney to
Port Phillip in 1824-5. It seems that at every difficulty
Hovell was for returning, at the rivers as well as at the
mountains. Either at the Hume or at the Mittai, Hovell
at first refused to cross, and they agreed to separate.
Over the division of the commissariat they had a small
set-to. Having only one frying-pan in the party, each
wished to keep it, and in the struggle for possession they
pulled the handle off. Hovell crossed later, but unfortu-
nately at that time there were no blacksmiths in those
parts to repair damages to common or kitchen
frying pans. “Karl” says: “All the success of the
trip was due to the bush-craft and able leadership
of Hume; all the misfortunes and delays to the
obstinacy and general crankiness of Hovell.” He says
this sarcastically, of course, but, nevertheless, it is quite
true. Mr. Rusden, one of the shrewdest and most pains-
taking of historical critics, declared that “to Hume alone
can be ascribed the leadership and its results ; and it is
proper to mention that, even while at Geelong, Hume and
Hovell differed as to the spot which they had reached.
Hume asserted that they were at Port Phillip ; Hovell
that they were at Western Port.”
The S. M. Herald, noticing, on April 28, 1873, the
recent decease of Mr. Hume and a controversy which was
taking place at the time in regard to the claims of the
two explorers for the credit of the leadership of the ex-
pedition, made the following - remarks : “The reader will
see that these counter statements may materially affect
the historical value of the account which has been
published by some friends of the late fellow-
traveller of Mr. Hovell.” Other expressions following,
bearing the impress of a leaning against Hume, a reply was
sent to the paper by one of Hovell’s own assistants, no
other than the Thomas Boyd mentioned by “ Karl,” then
85 years of age, who said : “I was present with Mr. Hume
when fie discovered that river, and when he named it the
Hume. . i . Captain Hovell is not entitled to be con-
sidered even a tolerable bushman, and Mr. Hume led him
and the rest of us to Port Phillip and back again. Only
for the bush tact of the * lent ’ servant, as I was termed
in ‘Historical Statements,’ Captain Hovell would have
perished ; and had anything happened to Mr. Hume, the
sole chance of saving the party rested with your obedi-
ent servant, Thomas Boyd.” In view of the above, I
fail to see how old Tom Boyd could possibly' have '*■
given “Karl” a “totally different impression.”
Boyd must have been pretty ancient when “ Karl”
had “ many conversations’ with him, and that,
perhaps, accounts for the fact that he contradicts
himself.
Mr. James Fitzgerald, of Glenlee House, near
Campbelltown, another of the 1824 party, stated
in the same paper (May 12, 1873): “As to whom
the credit is due for successfully carrying out
the expedition, I most unhesitatingly say that
Mr. Hume was the leader, and that during the
journey he was always in advance of the party, we
following his guidance.” The press of the day
gave that credit to Hume, who was regarded as
the explorer par excellence. One of the stoutest
advocates of Hume’s priority in the exploration
of 1824, and of the man generally, wrote to the
Yass Courier of June 11, 1872, as “ Australian ” :
“ I learn that the River Goulburn was named the
‘ Hovell,’ but had previously been named the Goul-
burn by Mr. Huine (he was always ahead of the
party); it was changed, I suppose, to gratify his asso-
ciate. Wood, in his book, ‘ Australia,’ is in error when
he states that there were ‘ two leaders in that expedi-
tion,’ and he is unjust to Hume when he places his
name after Hovell’s. Hume was sent for by Gover-
nor Brisbane to undertake the command of a party
to be landed at Wilson’s Promontory, to work
their way overland to the settled districts. Hume
refused, because he would not take the risk of dying on an
uninhabited coast, which would have been the case had
they failed to penetrate through the interior. After
some trouble and delay, Hume was solicited to choose his
own route, which was to endeavor to pass from the
settled districts to Western Port; then, if he found
the country too difficult for him, he could fall back on his
outward tracks. When all things were arranged, Hovell
asked to be allowed to join the party, and, through
Oxley’s influence, he was associated with it. The Sur-
veyor-General, believing him to be a ‘retired sea-captain,’
thought he would be useful in taking the latitudes and
longitudes. We all know that this was not done ; and of
what further use was he to the expedition? He was
found in men, but, equally with Mr. Hume, had to pro-
vision himself and find his own cattle; but in what con-
sisted his leadership ? Truth compels Mr. Wood to show
that the success of the expedition was due to Hume,
but he is unjust to Hume when he accuses him,
equally with Hovell, of losing his temper at their
first contact with the mountains. Hume never lost
his temper or became discouraged. Hovell got
frightened and wished to turn back; Hume insisted on
going forward, and searched for a pass, which he found.
Unpleasantness like this was always occurring.” The
two explorers received some compensation for their toil,
though far less than they expected, or even deserved. A
grant of 1200 acres, in that day, meant little more than
1200 half-crowns. Both had gone to great expense in
positive outlay, to say nothing of loss of time. Hume
sold a fine new English plough to add to his fund for ex-
ploration. Hovell presented a memorial, dated February 1,
1837, in which, like Oliver Twist, he came forward for
more. The expedition cost him not less than £5OO. His
1200-acre grant, as he said, “ sold at the price of a dollar
per acre, barely remunerated his actual disbursements.”
He asked for a “free grant of land to such an extent as
may be deemed a fair equivalent for the services he has
rendered to the public by his (?) expeditions.”

“Vigilans”: The natural breeding-
ground for horses for the Indian market is the
Barckiy tableland in the Northern Territory.
Both in climate and soil this tableland has every-
thing to recommend it. Much of it is limestone
country—the best for bone development. Bred
there, the horses would be dry-country horses, so
noted for stamina, general development and, in
fact, for everything that makes the difference
between a “sticker” and a “Sunday horse,” or
one-day animal. The fattening and growing
qualities of Australian grass on the tableland are
really wonderful. I have seen many fat horses
brought in from the runs, but I shall never forget
three I chanced upon when crossing that magnifi-
cent country. They were masterless exiles, and
ran into our horses, glad, no doubt, to see com-
pany. One of the party saddled one up. After
two hours, this obese animal simply lay down at
full length, quite pumped-out and done-up.
They would have taken prizes at a “fat” gelding
class at Homebush, and their coats shone like
satin as a testimony to the quality of the grass.
It is from this N.T. tableland, where horses can do
themselves so well on nothing per annum, that
the Indian army should draw its horse supply.

THE COW WAS MAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A wild cow charged a sulky here yesterday. The local
policeman shot the cow. The stock inspector held a
■post-mortem examination, and states the cow was mad.—
Country news item.
The cow was mad—she’d a rolling- eye,
She lashed her tail as the birds flew by ;
The name of the grass she ate was rye—
The cow was raving mad !
The cow was mad—she would stand and stare
Whenever the boy said, “ Git up there ! ”
And wave her tail in the country air.
The cow was raving mad !
The cow was mad —she was tired to death
Of the farmer’s thumps and his beery breath
And his daughter Maud Elizabeth —
The cow was raving mad !
The cow was mad—she was also sick
Of the d—d old grass by the dammed-up “ crick ”
And the eldest son—the big lout Mick.
The cow was raving mad !
The cow was mad (as a fool might see)
Of the awful blank monotony
Of sending milk to the creamery—
The cow was raving mad !
The cow was mad, and she 'madly ran
Whene’er they rattled the large milk-can,
She waved her heels at the serving-man—
The cow was raving mad !
The cow was mad —so she lay in wait,
And charged the cart at the farmyard gate.
The sergeant shot her. She died elate
With a sweet smile. Ah, well
No longer is she a cow forlorn ;
She’s a bovine wraith like the mist of morn,
With a golden halo upon her horn
In fields of asphodel.

“ Agricola ” : lie “ Henry Phelthatt ” and
the fox (B. 25/6/’08). I agree that the much-
skited wisdom of the fox is imaginary—witness
the ease with which it is shot or poisoned. But
still it shows cunning in the way it carries off a
duck, fowl or rabbit. Instead of allowing itself
to be inconvenienced, like a dog, by the weight
hanging from its jaws, it gives its head a jerk
sideways, and heaves the tucker over on to its
neck, where it is nicely out of the way. Its imp-
ishness is shown in the way it delights to tor-
ment a c-hained-up dog. Sitting a foot beyond
the limit of the chain it insults the K 9 most
vilely. But the unwisdom of the smellful red
thief is again shown, for the unholy row generally
attracts a bloke with a gun.

“The Prooslian ” : Let me hold forth
concerning a peculiar lizard found in the rocky
hills a few miles north of Adelong (N.S.W.). He
is about 4in. long, dark in color, and possesses a
queer horny-pointed tail, which he turns up in a
manner suggestive of a scorpion. If the lizard is
tapped, even lightly, on the back, this tail, which,
by the way, has a sort of claw finish, and can be
protruded or withdrawn at pleasure, instantly de-
taches and goes jerking about, looking for fight,
while the other end of the reptile bob-tails round
with mouth agape trying to chew the planet in
two, as a protest against the action of man in de-
priving him of his devilish-looking little tail. On
opening the jaws, a little blue bag is revealed,
which looks like venom. The residents say the
lizard is “pyzonous.”

“Nulla”: The Cow industry is respon-
sible for some queer happenings. On the N.S. W.
northern rivers, for instance, the wash from the
pig and butter steamers is causing erosion of the
banks, wherefore the milk-dragger thereabouts
arises in his wrath to demand that the speed of
these river greyhounds be limited to six miles per
hour! Under the same circumstances other
people would settle down to a spell of steady
work with a pick and shovel, and put in some ti-
tree fascines, or plant a few roots of marram
grass, but the northern river cocky is too busy
hunting up steady, reliable labor at 2Jd. per hour,
and teaching his kids how to dodge the school
inspector.
THE ABYSMAL JAY PAY.
BUSH J.P. (profoundly puzzled over the tangled nature of the evidence): “ Oh , well , I suppose
I shall know all about the case when I read the evidence in to-morrow's paper."
“Aural”: I -started, as though stung by
a boa-constrictor, on reading (B. 9/7/’08) “El-
more’s ” disgraceful untruth ‘ concerning the
alleged seemly usefulness of the wombat’s “fur” (?)
—by which “Elmore” means presumably the
crop of porcupine spines that stud the earth-
devil’s half-inch hide. Fur ! Ye gods ! As well
discuss a Berkshire hog in this connection as a
wombat. With regard to “Elmore’s” tergiver-
sation in re the wom.’s hide and its tanning capa-
bilities, exclamation marks fail me. It is impos-
sible to tan a wom.’s rind. I tried twice. I
soaked the overcoat of a wombat I knew in tan
for six weeks, and again for 52 weeks and a day.
The garment came out more or less soft at the end
of that time; but in three days was adamant
once more, and so it has remained ever since.

“D.M.W.”: Never, never will I refuse
to give a pipeful of tobacco to a deadbeat again.
I was five days in the bush without
tobacco. Ye gods, what I suffered !
There wasn’t a plug of Havelock
nearer than fifteen miles, and it
rained all the time. First day I felt
the want of something, but resolved
to suffer like a man. Night came,
and' I lay down in my bunk, but
sleep was scarce. My inner organs
seemed to be going gently round
in a circle all the time. Next day I
raked the bottoms out of several old
pipes, and had a horrible smoke.
After that I walked up and down the
hut, and brooded over every wrong
that I had ever suffered. I devised
hideous torments for all my enemies.
The second night I spent in dreaming
lurid and fantastic dreams. In the
morning, I tried to smoke brown
paper, also tea. The results were
too awful for description. Then I
began to chop firewood in the rain.
I got wet through and grew a little
light-headed. Several times I caught
myself addressing idiotic remarks to
the axe or the dog. Night brought
some sleep, broken by nightmare and
accompanied by deep remorse for all
the good deeds I had ever done.
On the fourth day I sat by the fire,
sucked an empty pipe, and occasion-
ally wept softly over my forlorn con-
dition. Again I tried to sleep, but
the circular motion of my contents
grew unbearable, and I rose and
paced the hut. At the first hint of
dawn I started out for the township.
At 12.30 I met a young fellow who
worked on the next run. He gave
me a cigarette. I grabbed it and
struck a light. The fragrance ran
along my nerves like fire. Twenty
whiskies couldn’t have made me as
drunk as I was for the space of half-
an-hour. At three o’clock I reached
the township, and was saved. I wept for joy.
Yes, I have learned at last that tobacco is the
chief factor in the higher civilisation.

“Hamer”: The Maori’s love of oratory
lingers unto his very latest breath. Curiosity
took me to a pah one day, and, as if it were one
of the sights of the place, the hospitable people
took me straight away to the bed of a Maori who
happened to be dying. I wanted to leave directly
I discovered what I had been brought to ; but the
white doctor present told me that my presence
would give satisfaction to the dying man. The
latter, when he saw me, made a long speech,
which was duly interpreted. The doctor prompted
me in my response, which was to the effect that I
was' “overcome with emotion to witness the
departure of one I should have liked fora friend.”
To this the dying man made another speech. Then
he made other speeches ; and even when he only
gasped he still made efforts at oratory ; and other
Maoris replied. It was a ghastly speech-day, and
I got out before the end. The doctor, as I went
home with him, told me that my arrival had re-
vived the man, and had probably extended his life
by at least an hour.
“Caber”: I see that “Bulawayo”
(B. IG/7/’08) wants to know what distance can be
done by a single horse between sunrise and a fair
time in the night. Don’t know for certain my-
self, but have heard pioneers speak of a canter
from Drayton to Brisbane—a matter of over
80 miles —as quite a commonplace affair.
That was some years before Lord Brassey’s father
and old man Peto connected Limestone and The
Swamp, and visitors to Brisbane had to do the
journey per pigskin. I tried it once myself, but
I walked the last ten miles —four of them hump-
ing saddle and bridle. The horse handed in his
resignation, and lay down for a well-earned rest
within four miles of the capital. An honest horse
ought to go his 90 miles, yet when Paddy
Kenniff told Chief Justice Griffith that he had
ridden that distance in 24 hours, the snort of un-
belief which met the assertion put Paddy’s neck
in the loop—the jurymen, who knew nothing
earthly about what a horse could or couldn’t do,
disbelieved with the Judge, and Paddy went over
and under. If he rode that 90 miles he was
innocent. If a horse couldn’t do it, then Justice
Griffith was right. lam going to watch carefully
how the answers to “Bulawayo” go—that snort of
incredulity remains on my nerves. Griffith used
to potter about Brisbane on a big white horse, but
that fact didn’t make him an authority.

“ D.” on an Outback curse :
The dour, stark lives of many of us who dwell
“ Pannikin ’’-like in the remoter wastes of the hindmost
section of Beyond are rendered yet dourer by the horse-
enthusiast from Sydney. I should like to lodge a protest
against that wild George-street cavalier. He generally
lives at Milson’s Point or Ooogee or Balmain. It is his
hobby to support, in one or other of those localities, a
brace of hungry-looking steeds carrying the “ ride-or-
drive ” brand. When he gets a holiday' he visits Beyond’s
hind-quarter—mainly with the object, it would seem, of
talking about horses. He wears an air of Olympian
gravity and knowledgableness always. If thoroughbreds
are under discussion he is aggressively reserved and
mysterious, recalling in manner the Russian secret service
agent of melodrama. He volunteers private stable
information, in a significant whisper, concerning
the dastardly tricks of Randwick trainers whom
he knows ; he resolves the secret of why The Corpse
was “ dead ”in The Staggerers’ Handicap; and discloses
the exact sum the venal lad Billo was paid to stiffen
Goanna in the Hurdles. Beyond is not interested. It
well knows that it is listening to lies impure and com-
pound. But it has no redress while our present archaic
hospitality-legislation remains unamended. After a while,
the harbor-side horse expert drops the subject of
thoroughbreds, and switches on to mere hacks, or sulky
horses, or polo-ponies. His air now grows somewhat less
portentous. He talkspatronisingly of “prads,” “poddies,”
“ brumbies.” He tells specious tales about animals he has
never known. Reminiscences of the saleyards stream
from him. The comic-relief of his life would appear to
consist in selling spavined and otherwise-diseased equines
to friends at exorbitant prices. Ever and anon, at the
thought of how an acquaintance was beguiled into buying
from him a blind or deaf or insane horse, or one with a
cork leg or a wooden head, helaughs cynically—though ever
with the restraint that marks the strong cold city horse-
fancier. (Why are horse-enthusiasts, who would start as
though kicked on a sore spot if taxed with card-sharping,
proud of the reputation of having swindled people over
horses?) The horse-liar of the metropolis is a whale on
the art of riding. He knows all about it. He can pick
you an infinite number of holes in the way another man
g s over a fence or a buckjumper’s head, or what not.
Bwj he essays none of those foolishnesses himself—unless
in fancy across the shag and the beer before a pub fire.
His power to exasperate, which is considerable, resides
mainly in his bagman-like hide and loquacity. Beyond
is inarticulate almost invariably; in the presence of the
city horse-tergiversator it grows helplessly dumb. But it
thinks in its own dull, cloddish way. Some day the
volcanic slag of its thoughts will surge up, and when the
health authorities clear the debris away afterwards they
will find underneath a metropolitan horse-fiend, hideous
in death.
ARCHES AND RABBITS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The daily papers state that, if a rabbit has died of phos-
phorus poisoning, it will shine with a bright radiance in
the dark, and thus warn the prospective eater.
lie the reception of the United States fleet, Mr. Janie
Graham, chairman of the decorations committee, has an-
nounced that the prospect was that the money forthcom-

—Sydney Telegraph.
If you ask us we’ll concede it,
But ice do not think you, need it,
’Tis a shame to squander money on a temporary show
Such a lot of “ beans ” on powder,
Just to make the guns bang louder.
Should at once upraise the question, “ Shall we spend out-
quids pro quo l ”
Take the flags that once gyrated
(When our soldiers emigrated)
From the darkness and the spider and the devastating
moth ;
Resurrect the dear old arches,
Reminiscent of the marches,
Of the “Noble lads, God bless’em,” and like patriotic
froth.
Get the carpenters and gluers,
There are lots of amachooers
Who will do it “ all for glory ” and despise the thought
of cash,
Though the work should turn out rotten
It must never be forgotten
That we did not blew our dollars on such lamentable
trash.
Now the topic turns on lighting,
And it really seems exciting,
Until someone gravely mentions (in the paper, vide files),
The illuminative habits
Of our ordinary rabbits; . . .
Iluny, cesthetic’lly, in hundreds they would blaze the sky
for miles !

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be taken of
communications insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must appear on MSS. No liability is under-
taken re contributions voluntarily submitted, whether
sent by post or handed in; and no MS. will be
returned unless stamps (of any State) accompany.
A.8.C.: The booklet was of no earthly use,
and there were no stamps for return, nor was there any
request that it should be returned, so the basket swal-
lowed it.... Robert Marlin: Hopeless verse about a
saveloy... .Diogenes : Episode of Willie and the monkey-
bear hardly stirring enough for a story. The verses were
several points below par.... Annie Doras: Your metre-
sense is faulty, and (for the manyth time) parodies are no
good to this paper unless they are specially excellent....
A.N.N. : Faint purple on both sides of
crumpled and dirty foolscap which is in 14 different
lengths or sizes. You have all the vices Will H. :So
many words, so little sense Dipso: There are points
about your argument on behalf of an elastic anti-drink
pledge, but it fails to make good.. ..Jerry : Your allega-
tions (l) that in parts of Monaro eels travel across country
in mobs, and (2) that they are in the habit of making
moonlight raids on lucerne-patches, have been denounced
by the office naturalist as untruths. In answer to your
question, no one in this office has ever seen an eel asleep.
... . The Wasp : There is a brooding sense of horror
about “Love and Death,” but it falls short of its
great model in the matter of technique. A spasm :
Three shots rang out thro
The mist veiled air.
And a lifeless mass fell
The grand Actress fair,
Then to cheat the law,
The distracted man of wealth,
Reloaded his pistol
And shot himself.
J.S.: In very sooth the Spectator (Christchurch)
should be ashamed of itself. The frank steal is bad, but
for the theft wherein an air of verisimilitude is given by
the altering of names, there is no word in all Webster....
Henri'Martin : Donation acknowledged elsewhere. Have
no knowledge of any fund being started for writer men-
tioned in your letter... .Canoblas : There is a gentle and
petted melancholy about your verses that depresses us.
blow the old homestead, and the memories of happy days
that are flown, and the dead leaves, and all the other
greenery-yallery-brovvnery circumstances ! Scientific :
Fact that “the American Imperial gallon is only five-
sixths of the British Imperial gallon ” has been duly in-
scribed in the office archives in case any of the staff elect
to engage in a drinking tourney with the visiting Yanks.
A slab of information like that may make all the differ-
ence between victory and an ignominious defeat on
points Plugger : Your treatment’s good enough, but
you haven’t been getting on to interesting subjects.
Moreover, even good stuff gets crowded out at times....
J. W. Walker : Please send address for return of your
clipping Pudd’nhead : Nicely written, but contains
nothing sufficiently new to make it shriek for print
Steeple : Just doggerel, and cost us 4d. for short postage.
....Marie F. : No substance in your tale of three lone-
some maids walking beside the moonlit waters
Henry Phelthatt: Unluckily the figures you give don’t
add up properly Elaine: An addressed envelope
does not condone, in this sordidly materialistic office, for
absence of stamps. If we sent back, at our expense, all
the bad verses that rain in, we should go broke.
... .L.A.D. :“ An Unlucky Sport ” endured his last blow
from fortune (18/7/’08), on which date he was accorded
W.P.B. burial E.B.G. : Probably he did. Sentencing
people to death was Windeyer’s hobby. Toiler:
Nothing in it that calls for print Rebel: It “ misses ”
more than ever, this time.... Cinch : There are several
points about it that “ give it away ” as a concoction....
Laertes : Sketch gorgeous, but rather weak. Pars out
of our line R. Williams : It has more spirit than skill.
Metre is your weak point Tffnax : You don’t make a
success of it C.L.E.: It balanced for a time on the
basket’s rim, but at last fell in Raymond G.: Your
touch isn’t light enough for that kind of humor
Periwinkle: It doesn’t “make good.” Cynthia S. :
Your point is better than your versification
J.T.C. : Reasonably well written, but the take-down
newchum has been too often done Le Tetsuen : The
“ Summer Girl ” nearly “ knocked ” us, but the other
sketch is poor K.W.S.: It very nearly persuaded us.
....R.P.: “R.1.P.” would meet the case Syd C.:
With a little more artistic skill you would do good work.
Will D. : “ Remorse ”is beyond criticism. A great dead
silence is best.... Onehunga : Grieved to hear the Hobart
papers afflict you with jokes, with which you were wont
to maim your schoolmates 20 years ago, but we can’t
interfere in the matter Geo. R. : Pretty verse, but the
“ sweet maid long dead” who is seen in the confirmed
bachelor’s pipe smoke-haze is such a very old maid
Quineecha: Don’t think the point matters much. ..
W.W.K. : Well, the Commonwealth statistics say that
meat exports to the United Kingdom in 1906 were :
Rabbits and hares £486,194, and all other meats (cow,
sheep, pig, etc.), £1,024,089, and the skin exports were:
Rabbits and hares, £378,765 ; all others (sheep, cow,
horse, wallaby, kangaroo, opossum, etc.), £956,727.
So Bunny has something to say for himself nowadays.
What your class largely hates him for is that the wild
rabbit gives employment to a class of independent laborers
who work for themselves while the tame cow and sheep
employ the wage-man who is under your control....
Cornstalk: “Romance” is ragged as to metre, and in
places bathetical. Good as a boy’s effort, bad as a man’s...
H.E.J.: Never heard of the Perth Sunday Times, but
have no doubt it is a very worthy sheet.... The Saw-
dust King: Unsuitable Sr.: That spade-shovel yarn
was one of the earliest yields of London Punch's chestnut
shrub.... Harum: A grim subject; grimmer and more
awful still in your treatment thereof Tariffina:
Can’t find your par. Try the back files at a School of
Arts which takes The Bulletin Ajax: Not up
McTavish : Norman Lindsay used up that “ Royal Family ”
joke long ago Child Slave: You write in anguish at
the idea that the cow-business prejudices education,
thus wise : “ There may be some what might be termed
child slaves in the Taranaki cow industry, but have never
seen any myself, although born and bred in Taranaki, and
seen a good bit of cow myself, being brought up to it,”
etc. And, despite that evidence of high education, The
Bulletin holds to its original view that the child slave
is rarely a decently-educated slave.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
RitaH.: Poor pun, poorly illustrated Eric C. B. :
No doubt it is humorous to see a cat’s tail trodden on,
just as there may have been something amusing about an
Early Christian martyr, but it wouldn’t illustrate well.
joe A. : The thumb-in-the-soup jest is very old, and
it was horrid when it was new ...E. Grannell: Hardly
suitable Flax : Sketch truly grievous, joke poor
Wog-Wog: Both your pictorial jokes are steals, and one
of them is stolen from this paper. You are a most in-
judicious thief.
Of the 36 delegates to the recent Federal
Labor Convention in Brisbane, 28 were members
of Parliament. Eight of these were Senators,
10 Reps., three members of Legislative Councils,
and seven members of State Assemblies. Only
one-half of the Ma State’s delegates were Parlia-
mentarians. Two of the 36 were women—Mrs.
Dwyer, of N.S.W., and Mrs. Miller, of Queens-
land. The latter was the oldest of the collection,
and Ben Watkins (Tas.) the youngest.

Jim Stanbury, sometime champion sculler
of the world, has got a Government job as ranger
at National Park, Port Hacking (N.S.W.). When
Stanbury was at the top of the tree, sculling
wasn’t the money-making game that it used to be.
As a matter of fact, professional sculling seems a
poor way of making a living. Whatever money
there is in it seems to go to the boat-owners whose
vessels follow the races.
AN INSPECTOR’S NEW BILLET.
An incident in Sydney tram strike.
The Governor’s speech at the opening of
S.A. Parliament included this kindly and well-
deserved send-off to the Big Dead :
During the recess death has removed one of the most
conspicuous figures from the sphere of Australian politics.
Charles Cameron Kingston will long be remembered for
his great ability and unsparing devotion to public duty.
As a former Premier of this State, and as Minister for
Customs in the first Federal Ministry, his administration
was marked with vigor and resolution. Though cut off
in the prime of life, he has won a commanding place
among Australia’s greatest statesmen.
The Sydney Telegraph probably wanted
to do Railway Commissioner Johnson a good turn
when it published his photo last Saturday, but
the thing would have been better left alone.
Possibly the photo didn’t do justice to Johnson ;
anyhow it showed a countenance with a cold eye
and a scoffing expression, and the general aspect
of a Superior Person, and there is no face like
that of a Superior Person for making trouble.
Even a gorilla head and a larrikin fringe have
advantages by comparison. It is just possible
that if Johnson had worn a beard to hide the cold
lofty smile that the Telegraph accuses him of, it
would have turned the scale in favor of peace.
Often great issues hang upon a hair.
A memorial bust to the
late Robert George Wynd-
ham Herbert has been placed
in the Colonial Office, Lon-
don, where deceased under-
secretaried for 21 years. Aus-
tralia has some memories of
Herbert. He emigrated to
this country in 1855, and
settled in the Moreton Bay
district, which became-
Queensland later on. When
the northern State set up in
business for itself, Governor
Bo wen invited Herbert to
form the first Ministry. It
lasted six years one month
and 22 days, and was the
champion long-distance Go-
vernment of Queensland. In
fact, it was almost the long-
distance Ministry of Aus-
tralasia ; the only Premiers
who beat Herbert in one
continuous effort were King-
ston (S.A.) and Forrest (Westralia). In ’6B,
Herbert went back to England, and, being a
heroic office-seeker, he there entered on a career
■of Under-Secretaryship, which lasted for about
the space of an ordinary lifetime.
Mrs. David Hill, who died at St. Alban’s,
Waverley Crescent, Sydney (19/7/’08), was the
relict of David Hill, accountant at the old Stamps
Office in the’seventies. He was a son of David Hill,
of the old Sydney family of that name, who kept
the Butcher Arms Inn on the south-east corner of
Pitt and Park streets in the early days. A
daughter married the Dan Cooper who made the
money that the present Bart, is spending at New-
market and elsewhere these days. Another
female descendant of the clan brought her beer-
money into the Wentworth family, and there are
a heap of male representatives in the Ma State.
“ Melb.’s ” story :
Samuel Mauger, Postmaster-General of this island, is a
great hero with the new sort of Pleasant Sunday After-
noon, the Judkins-CMwi-Tregear-cwm-Woodfull. 'Mauger
expatiates on crying iniquities in the Government regula-
tion of poor housing, child life, and so forth. People say,
“ Well, haven’t you got an oar in the Government boat?”
They even add that he can’t manage the Post Office.
Stung by this, Mauger lately resolved on doing some-
thing. A patentee captivated him with a receiving box
for letters, to be stuck to private houses, or at gates, and
so forth. Mauger rushed at this, and had placards
posted, urging the adoption of the box for the benefit of
the poor postmen. He even had these placards put up in
the Bourke and Elizabeth streets corridor of the G.P.O.
But he had reckoned altogether without the postmen!
They are up in arms against the idea. They work by
time, which has to be put in somehow, and'the boxes
would only give them further to walk. This, however, is
not the grand objection. In Melbourne, for example, the
postman’s Christmas boxes are worth from £lO to £3O a
year, according to the walk. And these would be all
abolished if the letter-carrier never saw the people of the
house, but merely communicated with a wooden recep-
tacle on the gate.
Died at Adelaide a few days ago, aged 72,
F. W. Tliring, who was third officer in McDouall
Stuart’s successful attempt to push through the
continent from south
to north, in 1860-2.
He had made two tries
before that. Natives
drove him back once,
and droughtthesecond
time. Thring was with
him on the three trips.
Stuart had been a sur-
veyor’s draughtsman
when he took up the
job of finding pastoral
country, chiefly for
Chambers and Finke.
(H en c e Chambers’
Creek, Chambers’ Pil-
lar, and the Finke
River in those Far
North regions. Also
the Katherine River,
which The Bulletin
had a leading article
about last week, was
named by Stuart after
one of Chambers’
daughters. The Fanny
was named after an-
other. ) Thring was the
horse expert; and he
reckoned that after
passing Newcastle
Waters the place
where they were stuck
up the second time—
they had great luck; the horses only had
to go without water one night. Stuart died in
1869 ; for years Thring stuck to horse-breeding,
for J. H. Angas and others, and later on went
into an agency business in Adelaide.
Glode hence the soul of Dr. J. B.
Mclnerney, aged 55. Deceased came from Dublin,
where he studied medicine at the Royal College of
Surgeons, and arrived in Victoria in 1874. His
skill soon apprised Melbourne of his address, and
it was not long before his practice had assumed
substantial proportions. Thereafter, he never
had to look back, as they say in the dailies. He
was elected physician to out-patients at the Mel-
brurne Hospital, and, a few years later, physician
to in-patients at the same institution. Following
those came similar appointments to St. Vincent’s
and Alfred Hospitals, the last of which he held at
the time of his death. He was a bachelor, and
resided in comparatively solitary state at Fitzroy.
Privately, he was a keen sportsman, and, in his
giddier days, owned racehorses.
Ex-public servant Henry de Boos, who
died at Leichhardt (Sydney), last week, aged 81,
was a descendant of the old French nobility (his
grandfather was a count), and a brother of the
late Charles de Boos, litterateur and N.S.W.
State servant. Henry did a lot of travelling,
chiefly in North and South America, in his early
days, ana came to Australia in 1848. He began
his public service as a wharfinger at Newcastle ;
grafted in the Works Department and Audit
Office, and retired in 1892 from the job of C.P.S.
and Warden’s clerk at Gulgong. His wife was a
Miss Singleton, a native of Singleton, and a
granddaughter of that Mr. Singleton who was the
cause of the town Singleton being called Single-
ton, which it was and remains so to this day.
THE BEGINNING OF THE SYDNEY
TRAM STRIKE.
Mrs. Esther Mary Trewyn Plunkett, of
Kirribilli (N. SW.), who died last week, was a sister
of “Tom” Lawrv, deceased, the North Shore forty-
thousand pounder and Brummel. She was the
wife of W. P. Plunkett, of Makinson and Plun-
kett, Gentlemen Two, Sydney, and was descended
on the female side from old Sam Terry, of Appin,
near Campbelltown, concerning whom the Sydney
Gazette wrote, in March, 1819 : “ Arrived, Mr.
Terry’s family of eight daughters and three sons,
the eldest not 21, the youngest not four.”
Melbourne Paunch prints a photo group
of its recently-bebaubled Lor’ Mayor Weedon,
J. M. Davies, J. A. Boyd and A. Craven,
M’s.L.A., as a bunch of representative Aus-
tralians, just as they appeared after being pre-
sented to the King. All four are in gaudy
uniforms, with buttons as big as pies, and they
wear swords, yards of gold lace and bushels of
frills, and Weedon is hung all over with gilt bul-
lock chains and filigree. It is a shocking spec-
tacle. Why doesn’t Tom Mann bid Weedon
arise and break his chains ?
From “ W.S.”
The recommendation by the Arsus people of Messrs.
J. J. Clark and 15. J. Clark as architects to the Melbourne
Hospital lifts into the public gaze a firm that has long-
been associated with large public buildings in Australia.
The senior member of the firm—the Clarks are father and
son—arrived in Victoria in the ’fifties as a very small boy,
but even at that early age he was gifted with a passion
for drawing lines with a ruler. At the age of 21 or 22 he
won the competition for designs for one of Melbourne’s
most prominent public buildings, the Treasury at the
head of Collins-street. That was the beginning. The
Melbourne Mint was his next big design—he was then in
the Government Architect’s office. He also carried out
the construction of Melbourne Government House and
the Law Courts in Lonsdale-street; designed the Customs
buildings in Flinders-street, and the old police court in
Little Collins-street. The last-named building is now
being pulled down to make room for the new Town Hall,
of which the facade, the part that will catch the public
eye, will be by the firm—the son having grown up by
this time. Other Melbourne buildings, for which one
or both of the Clarks are responsible, are the
Women’s Hospital, at present building; the Carlton
Refuge, just built; and the City Baths in Swanston-
street. The two members of the firm have been in the
Government service of every State in the Commonwealth
except Tasmania and S. Australia. In Queensland their
work includes the General Hospital and the Children’s
Hospital at Brisbane, and the Masonic Hall and the
Treasury buildings in the same city; and the Brisbane
City Council has resolved to spend £lOO,OOO on a new
town hall which Mr. J. J. Clark designed 20 years ago.
In Perth the Clarks recast and extended the General
Hospital, designed the Children’s Hospital, and converted
the Fremantle Town Hall into a theatre, where for the
first time the up-to-date cantilevers were used in Aus-
tralia to do away with view-intercepting pillars. Also
Westralia owes them eight or nine other hospitals.
In N.S. W. the Maitland and Newcastle hospitals are by the
firm, also the Waverley, Wagga Wagga, Orange, and
Armidale Town Halls. Halls and hospitals seem to .be
theirforte, for they are at present building for Auckland ■
a new town hall at a cost of over £BO,OOO.
“Karl ” : Be the recently-departed solici-
tor, A. G. Thompson, of much local fame in Bathurst
(N.S.W.). The beer-strugglers of that hamlet
invariably raised their hats to A.G., for there
was no telling what the day might bring forth.
As the shadow of a mighty rock in a weary land
was A.G. to the unfortunates who appeared before
the Bench, wearing a wreath of gin-leaves in
their hair. His reputation was great, and his
record declared it duly earned. As a public
speaker he was painful, though much in demand
at functions. He religiously went through a
peculiar ceremony with his notes while holding
forth. First he glanced at them. Then he care-
fully folded them and laid them on the table. Then
he picked them up again, unfolded them, gazed at
them once more, re-folded them, and thrust them
into his trousers pocket. This performance was re-
peated incessantly throughout his speech. On
one occasion, while attempting to report him, I
counted him do the performance 78 times. By
the 78tli time the notes had worn into four separate
pieces. If they had been sneaked away when he
first laid them on the table, I don’t know what
might have happened*.
“Iyles,” on Holman, M.L.A., considered
as a blessing and a curse :
From time immemorial all great movements have had
their obstructionists. In the person of VV. A. Holman,
M.L.A. and State Horrifier, the antagonistic element was
conspicuously represented at the recent Australian Labor
Conference in Brisbane. That vociferous politician pre-
dicted that, unless the delegates decided upon being
thoroughly anti-Australian, industrial legislation would
go to the Australian Government. Then there would be
a request for the railways, then lands, education, and the
control of mining. Now, he asked Conference, what man
of ambition in the State Labor party would remain in a
Parliament shorn of its functions in that manner?
Nevertheless, \V. A. Holman notwithstanding', those are
the very things that are going to happen sooner or later,
and that is the kind of shorn Parliament W. A. Holman,
M.L.A. and State Terrifier, will yet find himself in—
provided, of course, he isn’t thrust out, on his
pale political ear in the meantime. But, even as
the wind is tempered to the shorn lamb, there will be
two alternatives awaiting him. He may retrogress the
entire pig and become a shire councillor or city aider-
man, or he may reluctantly accept the inevitable and—
like a prodigal son—enter the Federal arena. But the
chances are that an individual who thinks—or professes
to think —that N.S.W. is more important than the whole
of Australia, would be inclined to consider the parish
pump a larger circumstance than a people’s Parliament;
which would be a high compliment to the pump, but a
poor tribute to Australia. Meanwhile, in spite of Hol-
man, M.L.A., McGowen, B.M. (which stands for ’Bus-
Misser), the Sydney' dailies, and other press and platform
obstructionists, the Labor movement is becoming more
and more Australian every day. Even Holman doesn’t
retard it much more than the fly that dug its feet into the
ground and held back Jehu’s chariot all it knew with its
teeth.
J. 0. L. Fitzpatrick, of N.S.W. Assembly,
belongs to the hurried, scuffling, ant variety
of member. In addition to some points of order
and a first-class row with the Labor Party, he
was down on the notice paper last week for six
questions, four notices of motion, and a job lot of
Select Committee motions. His sphere of activity
embraces the fruit fly, the Official Assignee, the
Tovvac public school, the State Bank, the hours of
policemen, the cancelled leases, and dirty pie
shops. If every State M.L.A. fled over the wide
field of political endeavor with the furious energy
of Fitzpatrick, Parliamentary institutions would
collapse under the strain.
A plucky Australian dropped out of public
life with a great thump at ’Frisco last month.
“ Captain Penfold ” (he is a Sydney native, and
his private designation is Vincent P. Taylor) has
been doing tall things lately, as an aeronaut on the
Pacific Coast, and was the first to welcome Uncle
Samuel’s fleet to ’Frisco—he waved the cordial paw
from a balloon on behalf of a local paper. A few
weeks back a new airship was booked to fly.
“ Captain Penfold ” tried persuasion, then bribery,
then more persuasion, then curses and corruption,
for permission to be a passenger. Finally, ho stowed
away, which is a reckless thing to do on an airship.
The fiendish implement held together just long
enough to carry the rest of the machine sufficiently
high to drop it with deadly effect. Then it burst,
and the Australian was one of those who needed
the ambulance most. He got two broken feet and
an injured spine, and will probably be a life-long
cripple.
THE SMILE THAT DIDN’T.
Mr. Johnson said that five or six months ago he was
travelling' on the Ocean-street tram, when he heard a
young lady boast to some friends that she never paid the
full fare. “ The conductor on this tram is a friend of
mine,” she explained, “and I just smile at him.” When
the car arrived at the top of William-street, Mr. Johnson
watched the conductor come round. The girl smiled at
him. But the conductor took no notice of the smile.
He held out his hand for another penny, and with a rather
shamefaced look, the girl had to pay the extra penny, in
spite of the boast that she had made.
Labor Premier Tom Price doesn’t get back
to S. Australia much improved in health. He
says the trip back from Europe pulled him up ;
but he still looks aged, worn and tired. In
England he rushed all the time ; he went to boom
S. Aus., and it probably never before got so much
attention from the papers. A Labor Premier was
a curiosity, and, mainly because of his tremen-
dous earnestness and his good sense, he “caught
on.” In Liverpool the merchants subscribed to
give the local Mechanics’ Institute a painting (by
Douglas Mackenzie) of the Laborite curiosity ;
and a replica is to be sent on to Mrs. Price—the
simple, devoted lady who watches her Tom day
and night, and was shocked when, consulting a
doctor on the other side, the bubbling, impres-
sionable striver was warned that he must either
“go slow” or be prepared to “go off” at any
moment.

FAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The question why fat men walk with a proud carriage
and wear a fierce expression was discussed before the
Academy of Sciences, Paris, on April 17. Professor
Robinson gave a long and technical explanation of these
phenomena of adiposity. —Sydney Star Wewtt Item.
I’m glad that science its perceptive eye
Has turned on this most strange phenomenon ;
Gazing on Fat I’ve often pondered why
It is so fierce, and so much “dog” puts on.
Oft have I watched, pacing adown the street,
The indent-fiend, stout, yet of little worth ;
A type one mostly doesn’t care to meet—
Withal he walked as though he owned the Earth.
I never hied me Burwood-wards, the while
A Fed’ral contest raged, but Mister Smith
My vision crossed —his gait and wide proud smile
Suggesting some contented monolith.
Greid scoffs, self-satisfied, at friends who wail
Re his burst promises. (My view is that
The wild rebukes of Greid’s supporters fail
Mainly because the one rebuked is fat.)
As to opponents, ’tis the Greidly way
To let these say and think the things they please.
A placid smile George Houstoun wears alway.
He can —he has a surplusage of grease.
It is the same with Dowie, Tummus Bent,
And all, the human jests that tip the scale
At outsize weights ; the voice of Wroth is spent
Against their fat, and is of no avail.

EVERY JOINT A HOT BED OF
RHEUMATISM.
Queensland Woman Found the Right Wat
to Cure It.
Suffered for Eight Years with Swollen,
Aching Joints—a Helpless, Bedridden
Cripple for Months—then was Cured by
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.
Rheumatic sufferers mustn’t lose sight of the
fact that rheumatism is a disease of the blood. It’s
acid in the blood. If the acid wasn’t there, there
wouldn’t be rheumatism. Therefore to cure it,
get the acid out. Until you do you’ll continue to
suffer. Every change in the weather and your
joints and muscles will be hot beds of pain. Every
move will be torture. You may soon be too
crippled to walk ; too helpless even 'to feed your-
self ; just practically paralysed with pain.
Then to get the acid out, a blood medicine.
That’s what Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are. When
you start with them to cure your rheumatism
you’re on the right track. They go for the cause
of the complaint. You can’t begin to cure your
rheumatism too soon, for the longer you have it
the longer it ta.kes to cure. Begin with Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills to-day. There’s the experi-
ence of so many Australians who have banished
their rheumatism with Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
that there’s no room to doubt.
Amongst these is Mrs. James Matthews, who
lived for a number of years in Queensland, but
who now lives at 12 Washington Street, Sydney.
“ I suffered for years from rheumatism,” said
Mrs. Matthews. “ I fell in a creek one day up at
Narrabri and was nearly drowned. I had to sit
in my wet clothes, and I blame this for bringing it
on. I suffered practically all the time for eight
years. I was first attacked in both legs and hardly
for a day at a time was I free from pain. My
knees would swell up dreadfully and I’d be rack-
ed with pain in every joint. I lost two stone in
weight and got worse and worse. My arms got
affected. As sure as I dipped my hands in water
my wrists would puff up as if I had dropsy. For
at least a week at a time I’d be practically help-
less. I couldn’t hold a needle, couldn’t do a bit
of housework, couldn’t do my hair or put on my
blouse. Round my right shoulder was all puffed
up. All the parts would be inflamed and I
couldn’t bear anyone to come near me. I’d be so
stiff 1 couldn’t move a limb. I was half the time
in bed. At night I could hardly close my eyes.
I tried all sorts of embrocations, but nothing eased
the attacks or even drove away the constant ache.
I’d be wrapped in flannel. The least change of
weather brought on an attack. For six months at
a time I wouldn’t go outside the house. I couldn’t
walk ; I’d just hobble from room to room. A
friend in Narrabri who had suffered the same
begged me to try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, and I
did. I felt considerable relief with the fourth
box. My joints did not swell up so much and
were less inflamed. With a couple more boxes
the constant, tormenting ache began to get less
and my joints were not so stiff. With the seventh
box the pains were rapidly leaving my system.
I began to walk easily and to sleep better, and I
began to eat and pick up in flesh. I could do my
hair and work about the house and not have to
stop in bed for days at a time. Once I thought I was
practically a cripple for life, but Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills saved me from that.”
Remember, Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are for
any complaint that a good supply of rich, red
blood will cure, but you must have the genuine
Dr. Williams’. Sold by chemists and The Dr.

ANOTHER GLARING CASE.
The Australian grain buyers’ association has resolved
not to buy or sell wheat except at its own prices. This
amounts to a corner against the farmer and the con-
suming public.— Melbourne AGE.
Some more good N.S.W. money is going
to be wasted in nagging at the Australian Parlia-
ment in the law courts. The Carruthers-Wade
push has already nagged in the courts three times,
and has been biffed out with Costs every time,
and has been also fined £5, as if the Ma State were
a common drunk. Now an attempt is to be made
to recover from the Australian Parliament the
money that has been set aside for improved
defence and for old-age pensions, so that N.S.W.’s
share may be added to the State surplus (which
amounts, Wade says, to over a million already),
and Australia may be left unprotected while
Waddell wallows in horrible affluence.
A humorous phase of the Sydney tramway
struggle was the offer of Commissioner Johnson to
the members of the union executive. He admitted
that his spy system isn’t perfect, and said that if
they could suggest a better scheme than that by
which the casual mistake of the private detective
means the loss of a conductor’s billet and cha-
racter, he (Johnson) would adopt it. The men
composing the executive receive about £l3O per
annum each. Johnson receives £3OOO a year
to run things properly, and he had the calm im-
pudence to suggest that the £l3O per annum man
should do the work he is paid £3OOO per year to
do. Johnson is a humorist.
Bowden, the sluggish .Freetrade solicitor
who represents Lithgow (N.S.W.) these days, has
been very silent over the ironworks trouble. He
dare not say that Freetrade is what Lithgow
needs, for it was Freetrade that shut the place
up ; and not having the versatility of Bill Wilks
he doesn’t know how to demand Protection for
Lithgow and yet preserve a consistent Freetrade
attitude. So Bowden has, so to speak, hid him-
self under the table, and said little or nothing.
But Lithgow will almost certainly hunt for a new
representative at next election —one who will be
of some use when a fight is on.
“ Scrub Lease ” writes :
You say that the people of Tamworth would rather
trust to the Peel River Co. to cut up their big
estate than wait for the snail-like Wade Govern-
ment. True, Wade’s crowd is slow, but to give
the Devil his due, it is sure. When the Government
does in the distant future finally cut up the land, it will
be cut up. That is to say, never at any time can
the holder of any area of the estate transfer his holding to
any person who is ineligible to take up an original O.P.
lease. In other words, the estate cannot aggregate itself
together again. The crowd that is hollering- for Private
Enterprise to cut up the estate knows that this provision
would not be insisted on if the co. cut up the estate itself.
Consequently, buyers under the Peel River Co.’s title
will be able to sell out to anyone. The idea of closer
settlement will be defeated, but the door will be opened
for profitable land jobber}'. I’m no Wader, but it seems
that that person’s slow methods are being used as a
stalking-horse by people who have a tomahawk to
sharpen.
The Chow alien sheds the placid kindliness
for which the pro-nigger crowd lauds him, and
upheaves himself murderously on strangely slight
provocation. Says S. M. Herald, in its smallest
print (24/7/’08): —
The reffisal of James Gainesford, special watchman on
board the British steamer Suveric, Captain William
Shotten, loading lumber at Tacoma for Manila, to allow
the Chinese crew of 72 men to go ashore recently, so
maddened them that they attacked him with hatchets,
marlin spikes, hatch bars, and other weapons, breaking
his ribs and otherwise injuring him. But for the timely
arrival of the ship’s first mate and others of the crew, the
Chinese would have succeeded in lynching Gainesford
with a rope which they attempted to put around his neck.
The Chow A.B. is cheap, unquestionably, in the
matter of wages and keep, but his chronic habit
of taking to the ship’s hatchets, etc., when
annoyed makes him an expensive luxury in the
long run.
Brisbane isn’t a very big city, but its
postal report shows that even a comparatively
small city can hold a fair amount of muddle and
foolishness. Last year, for instance, more than
1000 articles were posted in Brisbane
without addresses. In the matter of
letters alone there were also 733 which
were wrongly addressed, and 56 of these
contained money, the total being about
£lOOO. The number of letters that
were insufficiently addressed (with
such directions as “ Mrs. Smith, at the
Back of the Church, Queensland”)
numbered 6400, but in over 4000 cases
the addressee was discovered by the
postal authorities and the letter de-
livered. Among the other cases in
which complaint was made about
articles not reaching their destination,
there were 25 instances in which it
was found at last that the packet had
never been posted at all; the person
who should have posted it found it
at last in his inside pocket or some-
where. In 23 cases the goods had been
delivered, but the recipient had mislaid
them and forgotten that they had
arrived. About the maddest person was
one who was quite sure the lost letter
had been put in the box; but, on in-
quiry, it transpired that it had been
given to a man to post; and he, being
tired, had handed it to a boy; and
the boy, not feeling too fresh, had
given it to a gatekeeper ; and the gate-
keeper, being exhausted or busy or
something, had given it to a railway
guard ; and the railway guard couldn’t
remember anything about it. Out of
these blunders a few people, of course,
raised a howl about “Federal mis-
management,” but that howl is pretty dead now.
It wasn’t a real grievance—only a fashion or a
craze, like the custom of wearing a stuffed pelican
in the hat; and no one really hears anything
about it these days.
Nielsen, Labor M.L.A., made a memor-
able remark during the censure debate in N.S.W.
Assembly. Speaking of the financial scheme
devised at the Brisbane Labor Conference, he
said :
It allowed a sum not exceeding £1,000,000 as provision
for the Northern Territory, for the Federal capital, and
for defence. This basis of settlement should receive the
approval of every man who was prepared to be fair to the
Federal Government.
One million for the military and naval
defence of a country the size of Europe;
for the government (including making
of roads, railways, bridges, culverts,
etc., also the maintenance of police,
magistrates, gaols, law-courts, hospi-
tals, and so on) of over 500,000 square
miles of territory, and for the payment
of interest on some £3,000,000 or
£4,000,000 of debt; also for the con-
struction of a new city, with its drain-
age system, water supply, public build-
ings, streets, pavements, and the other
appurtenances of civilisation ! One
million ! It is a wonder these wild
humorists didn’t propose tuppence!
And it must be remembered that
after 1910 the Australian Parliament
has the sole right to decide what shall
be done with the Customs and Excise
revenue; so State member Nielsen
kindly offers the Commonwealth
£1,000,000 of its own money ; which is
very like telling a man that he may keep
his own boots provided he gives up all
the rest of his property.
Australia has just got another hint that
the North is looking South—the North where the
yellow men are, to the South where we and
the empty spaces are. The first of a new line of
Dutch-owned boats from Java and Batavia is now
on the way to Australia ; and Java and Batavia
are a sort of half-way house between Japan and
Australia. The Japs have a frequent and regular
steam-service there, draw most of their sugar
from those islands, and are rapidly pushing them-
selves into a strong position thereabouts. In fact,
it is probably the subsidised competition of the
Jap on the Asiatic east coast that is beating the
Dutch line off the old tracks and on to new
Southern routes.
OUT OF DATE.
Suggestions have been made to the Australian Govern-
ment for providing airships for defence purposes.
The idea is quite feasible, and should be an
advance on the Federal Opposition air-balloon.
The Age, which has definitely decided to
go in for a land-tax, is extremely wrath with the
Bent Government over its bogus Land Bill, which
does not propose any taxation, but only a new
system of valuation. Says the Symes’ paper :
The Bent Government’s Land Valuation Bill is one of
the most speciously spurious pieces of make-believe legis-
lation it has yen brought forward. ... We have the
phenomena, on the one hand, ,of large areas of land being
held and not being put to their full productive use ; and,
on the other hand, large numbers of people wanting to
use the land who cannot get it. This evil, asserted Mr.
Mackinnon, demands the remedy of a tax that will force
all our land into production. We can all agree with him
up to that point.
Unfortunately the State Parliament holds such a
number of Tory members that even the curse of
the Age isn’t likely to make it move.
A most disquieting spectacle these weary
times is the alarming activity with which
the Bent Government is marking time. Tommy’s
pre-sessional blather portended a formidable heap
of work ; but, seemingly, he has found work a
fearful weariness, and is leading the strenuous life
of yawns. Certainly, the Murray Waters Bill has
been mentioned, and a couple of Bills anent a few
square inches of real estate at Castlemaine and
Elsternwiclc have disturbed the dead quiet of Vic.
Parliament; but, beyond them, there has been
little violence. Most of the members are fagged
with the heavy labor of moving adjournments, and
quite a number have not yet recovered from the
painful fatigue of the previous recess. Still, there
is one comfort. They will never be accused of
“hasty legislation.”
“ Old Captain ” writes :
“0.K.” discourses in Bulletin (16/7/’08) on Sir Geo.
Doughty, and his complaint in the House of Commons
about what was done to certain Grimsby smacks caught
fishing in German waters. “ 0.K.” puts it —“ accused of
fishing in Kaiser William’s portion of the sea,” which
looks a little different, implying that Kaiser William has
some sort of personal interest in the business, and the
seizure of the smacks was a deliberate attempt to provoke
a war with Britain. But the same sort of thing is done
every day on the British North Sea coast, where the
territorial waters are regularly patrolled to keep off
foreigners, and the foreign fisher person, when caught by
British authority, is treated much worse than the Grimsby
men were, for not only their fish and tackle, but their
boats are confiscated. “0.K.” seems to have caught
spy-fever badly. The German Government isn’t accus-
tomed to waste much good coin on spies. Most of the
information it wants about “ English seaports and vulner-
able points” can be boug-ht much more cheaply than by
paying people to travel round. A set of large-scale
ordnance maps would tell the Germans more than a
hundred zealous and capable spies could learn in five
years, and Boddy, in High-street, Woolwich, would sell
them for a sovereign almost as many military secrets
as they want, all in print.
HIS MORAL SUPPORT.
He preferred the representative of the people who did
not attend so frequently, but sat the real business out, to
the individual who poked his nose indoors at every sit-
ting for a few minutes only, so that his record might be
good, and then left to amuse himself elsewhere. —W. H.
KELLY, M.H.R.
EXCITED VOICE FROM THE STALLS: “ Take cure,
Willy, don’t hurt yourself! ”
The glad news comes by cable of the
upheaval of the Young Turkey party at Con-
stantinople. After long acquaintance with the
old turkey party who keeps a restaurant in
Sydney and charges Is. 6d. for lunch, this paper’s
sympathies are all with the new movement.
The deputation that came down from
Tamworth to ask N.S.W. Lands Minister Moore
to let the dear, philanthropic, public-spirited
Peel River Land Co. subdivide its 300,000-odd
acres in its own way and in its own time, got the
reply it deserved. Briefly, Moore remarked that
it took the co. all the years down to 1904 (when
the Closer Settlement Act was passed) to make
under 20,000 acres available; and that works out
at an average of about 400 acres a year. But still
Minister Moore can’t crow. His crowd hasn’t
made 400 acres of Peel River land available even in
four years.
Wellington is a horrible place to live in,
and the fact that it is the capital has always been
one of the hardships of political life in Maoriland.
When the Houses of Parliament were destroyed
by fire, some time ago, many people considered it
would be a good idea to again shift the capital,
and the other day somebody moved a resolution
to that effect in the House. It was biffed out,
but the remarks of members indicated that there
is a growing sentiment against having the seat of
government situated in a seaport town. Austral-
asia is growing up, and it begins to realise that
the summer-afternoon peace that has brooded
over the South Pacific for centuries is liable to
come to a sudden and lurid end. Therefore capi-
tals that may be shelled from the ocean grow un-
popular.
A Monaro man gets into the witness box
and repeats to the S. M. Herald the old story of
the land-grabber :
In Monaro, years ago, in the days of the shepherd, every
shepherd who had a family was privileged to cultivate.
At that time there were from eight to twelve flour mills
working in Monaro, which are now silent. Those mills
were mostly prosperous concerns until well into the 70’s.
After that they began to decline, the reason being the
general fencing in of large estates, the buying out of the
smaller selector and starving out of the larger. If you
pick up the parish map you will see it dotted with land
selected by Smith, Brown and Jones, and later transferred
to the station.
But that is on page 3. Page 4, where the Herald
prints its misleaders, is still blissfully unconscious
of all the truths that other people tell it on all
the other pages. On every other page the
Herald’s facts shriek for a graduated land tax
to break up the big estates and keep them broken
up ; but the leader page remains blind and deaf
through it all.
WASTER WADE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With reference to the earmarking of part of the June
surplus for defence purposes, N.S.W. Premier Wade says
that he cannot see that a month or so would make much
difference.— News item.
Knowing well the Brown and Brindle
We, with eyes and breasts a-kindle,
To our doors have nailed the notice: “ No Admittance
but to Whites.”
Yet this politician State-ly
Fishes calmly and sedately,
And the Asian hordes make ready while the leaping
kingfish bites.
What though settlement’s retarded
And our coasts lie still unguarded ?
What if there are only fences where the town and farm
should be ?
Hear the Waster purr, “ Don’t worry !
What on earth’s the need to hurry.”
And he baits and flings a fish-hook in the unprotected sea.
Oh ! the years have come and faded,
And we’ve never been invaded—
Never has our fair Australia swooned beneath the hail of
lead—
Listened to the volleys scattered,
Looked upon her legions shattered,
Mourned beside the shallow trenches packed with
huddled, broken dead.
Yes, this gospel of “ To-morrow ”
Gives occasion for much sorrow,
For we’re drifting fast to leeward while the work of Life’s
delayed ;
Though his creed may please the Quakers,
We’ll be right amongst the breakers,
While the kingfish are a-biting at the fishing-line of
Wade.

•MALTHOID ROOFING
NOT THE SAME AS OTHERS.
“If it is not seemly, do it not;
If it is not true, speak it not." —Marcus Aurelius.
MALTHOID ROOFING still increases in popularity. It’s adaptability
renders it an ideal roofing for architects to specify, builders to use, and the
public to enjoy. That magnificent pile of residential flats at Milson’s Point,
facing Circular Quay, is covered with a MALTHOID FLAT ROOF. Think
of the convenience and enjoyment of such a glorious promenade and outlook.

19173 Rob Roy Mackintosh.
Descriptive of Rob Roy’s first visit to London
and Paris, and the havoc he caused among
the fair sex in his Highland costume.
19174 She’s My Daisy.
Sandy is a soldier man, and the admiration
of all the “ Slaveys..” Daisy, his bonnie
Daisy, is his choice of the lot, and he sings of
her charms and of his willingness to lose his
spurs before he will lose her.
19175 Tobermory.
This song was suggested to Mr. Lauder while
standing on Gourock pier, Scotland, watching
an excursion steamer starting for the west
coast.
19176 We Parted on the Shore.
The singer points out the dangers of being
hundreds and thousands of miles out at sea,
but adds that it is a long way from anyone
to whom you owe money. The manner in
which the singer rolls his r’s is an effective
part of the Record.
19177 The Saftest o’ the Family.
The “Saftest ” is a younger number who goes
to school, but don’t always get there. Some
of the reasons that he assigns for his absence
furnish the basis for the song. These reasons
must be heard to be appreciated. They are
laugh-provoking.
19178 I Love a Lassie.
While not without its humor, it is really a
charming hit of sentiment, revealing the
actor’s love for his wife. The air of the song,
while simple, has a catchy lilt that w'ill
become popular here with the sale of the
Record.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, July 28, 1908.
My Dear Arini.—
Personally I have to thank the tram-strike for
the delightful discovery of the art of walking. Of
la,te years Sydney has been a place of noise and
discomfort; its streets were really railway tracks.
Now they have become boulevards, where one
can promenade at one’s ease, and in perfect
security. If the strike only continues I
can see open-air cafes established across
George-street, where one can ltinch in peace
and watch the women go by. There is a sylvan
quiet about the city that is restful to overtried
nerves. Instead of the clanging and buzzing of
trams one can delightedly listen to the quieter
music hitherto drowned beneath the surface of the
Big Din. There is the peaceful passing of the
hansom, the musical toll of the town clocks, the
soothing tread of leisurely feet. Sydney is
relapsing into rustic calm, and, as I" al-
ready mentioned, the lost art of walking
is ours once more with all its quiet delight and
recrudescence of. health. Given a fortnight’s strike
and we shall have forgotten our livers ; and with
indigestion and doctors we shall be troubled no
more. And with no trams at night one can go
quietly home and spend the evening in peace,
retiring early in readiness for the pleasant
four-miles’ trudge in the cool morning. Why
go back to trams at all ? The strike has
shown their uselessness, their jarring un-
pleasantness, their commonness, their vul-
garity, their coarse riot and loud penny arro-
gance. Providence intended neither rhan nor
woman to be inserted inside a hollow piece of
wood and charged 2d. for a rag of paper with
figures on it. Let us plant three rows of trees up
George-street, and encourage dicky birds.
I came across this in an evening paper :
Those who came from Ocean-street by a tram shortly
after 9 o’clock were surprised to see a well-known resi-
dent of Darling Point in conductor’s uniform doing the
“Pare, please,” business. He is the owner of a motor-car
and a yacht. In reply to a friend, he said : “ I have some
time on my hands, and when I volunteered yesterday I
was accepted. Pour or five of my neighbors have pro-
mised to offer their services to-day. I am doing this
work as a matter of principle. If I didn’t bother my head
about the strike I could be driving my own motor. I
regard it as a duty to stand by the Commissioners.” I
I have Since been told, however, that the report,
though scrupulously correct so ifar as it goes, is
incomplete. At 10.30 a.m. two well-known
Federal politicians, inefficiently disguised in
masks and the garb of purity, boarded this car at
William-street. “Mark him closely, Willy!”
hissed the stouter of the two. “He iS'an im-
porter.” “Right, George” (or words to that
effect), replied the other, and purchased tickets
for two. An hour later the Darling Pointer was
in the presence of Johnson. “ How do you plead ?”
he was asked. “Not guilty, ” responded the accused
more by force of habit than anything else. “Fired,
and sentenced to have his uniform removed with
contumely,” remarked the C mmissioner laconic-
ally. “Next case.” In the- oackyard without a
dramatic scene was enacted. The stouter of the
two detectives tore the condemned collector’s bag
from him and jumped on it, whereat it burst. The
youth known as Willy then advanced to slow
music, and tore the buttons one by one from the
official’s uniform coat. At this stage all broke
down hopelessly, and Johnson swam forward to
discover the origin of the dampness. “He is an
importer and, therefore, unquestionably guilty,”
quoth the foreign-bred ratiocinator. r “On the
other hand, the evidence against him is rotten to
the verge of decomposition. He will accordingly
be re-instated in three days, and the lad Willy
will be mulcted in the cost of one motor-car for
damaging his uniform.” Whereat, amid cheers,
the incident closed.
Lady Northcote took her afternoon of music at
the Sydney Symphony Orchestra on Friday,
wrapped in Russian sables, with a black panne
hat feathered with peacock blue. The two crowds
—that from the concert and the other from the
Mayoress’s meeting (to decide on the remem-
brancer to her Ex.) —converged when coming out,
and each gazed in surprise at the other. One
crowd looked musical culture, pastoral symphony,
and bits of “Das Rheingold,” and the other in-
timated, “We are the People, and we are going
to present Lady Northcote with a gold loving cup,
suitably branded, and inscribed with Australian
gems.”
Excellency Lady Northcote is adding to the
sum of her kindly deeds. On Tuesday afternoon
she entertains the children of the Free Kinder-
garten and their mothers at the Tivoli Theatre.
A special programme, moistened with afternoon
tea, has been arranged. Performing monkeys,
and dogs, cinematograph pictures, and Punch and
Judy shows are promised. Miss Ellen Desailly,
general secretary of the Kindergarten Union, is
keeping a guiding eye and hand oiUthe treat.
Miss Amber Reeves, daughter of the High
Commissioner of Maoriland, has gained another
wad of academic paper. She has been bracketed
first in Part 11. of the Cambridge Moral Science
Tripos, which is a big achievement. Miss Reeves
went to England when she was a small girl, and
entered Newnham College at 17. Her proud
mother told an interviewer that Amber would
most likely enter the School of Economics, with a
view to obtaining the doctorate in that science.
Last week’s cables told that Papa Reeves had
been appointed Director of the London School of
Economics and Political Science in connection
with the London University. Miss Reeves is an
ardent suffragette, her mother says, and the only
fly in her Amber was “that she was unable to
join in Saturday’s great march.”
Zira, the nurse, struck the trail of Marise the
Thief on Saturday night at Her Majesty’s, and
trailed along like a quiet and not very interesting
centipede until the third act. There Miss Anglin
gets her great chance pleading, entreating,
grovelling, and then upbraiding—but to a woman
in this instance, not to a man, as in “ The Thief.”
Such a Cat as theother woman is ! When she was
struck by a splinter from a shell and fell an
apparently mangled remains, a man in the stalls
remarked aloud and with conviction “Good enough
for her.” Zira is a more sympathetic character
for the audience, and a more lovable woman
generally, than Marise, the frocky kleptomaniac.
She is a character study from a book written 35
years ago, and she is somewhat of a misfit in the
enlightenment and intelleetualism of to-day,
when chorus girls with mottled pasts marry
peers, and in a decade or so are asked by an arch-
bishop to hold a brief for the Seven Cardinal
Virtues at a eoroneted meeting called to discuss
means for The Conversion of Women Who Have
Put a Foot Through the Decalogue.
But the playgoer who gallops to “The Merry
Widow ” or •“ The Prince of Pilsen ” three nights
a week hates the word “study,” even when prefixed
and modified by the other word, “character.” In
an interval I talked with a girl in the circle. She
said that when she was choosing a book from the
circulating library she glanced through it, and
if there was ' anything about a dressmaker
discussing, clothes with a client, and a
young baronet or an officer talking to
a lady in a drawing-room, she always took
the book, and was rarely disappointed. She:
also liked lords, officers, dressmakers, and clients
in a play, and was sorry that the story of Sally
Snape (afterwards Lady Kidderminster) hadn’t
been dramatised for Miss Anglin’s benefit—Sally
exhibiting, on her slender person, costly costumes
in a swell millinery and frockery establishment;
Sally getting the loan from the man-milliner of a
60-guinea.gown to go to dinner with the peer’s
heir; Sally (whose wages were 16s. a week) long-
ing for an emerald-green chiffon “made off
the shoulders and full in the skirt”; Sally
giving the peer’s heir “one on the jaw”
when he tried to kiss her; and Sally being
received as a daughter into the bosom (the starred
and medalled and jewelled bosom) of the Kidder-
minster family against a Monte Carlo back-
ground. Didn’t I think it would “go” beauti-
fully, and wouldn’t Miss Anglin be strong (as if
that artiste were Dutch cheese) as Sally !
Miss Susie Vaughan (why hasn’t that towering
lady the front name of Judith instead of the dolly
prefix/Susie?) is the only well-gowned party in the
play. As the. titled dowager, she dresses richly.
Miss Anglin appears first in a purse’s uniform ;
she does her slumming in black—utilitarian
black; she confesses in cream .cloth, with raised
silk embroidery, and her running-away costume is
a grey macintosh and a dejected-looking hat.
He—the parson—proposes to her as she is in this
get-up, so she doesn’t run away. The curtain
runs down on the “ Will-you ?”-“ Yes-I-will”
climax.
Not many of the well-known first-nighters
loomed around. Perhaps they were at “Miss
Hook of Holland. ” A Rossetti-looking damosel
with the Rabbi’s party was the best-looking cir-
cumstance in my neighborhood. She had a pile
of a beautiful shade of red hair, with two little
grey wings—no bigger than sparrows’ pinions—
m it. The tendency of the red-haired woman to
plant her hair with emerald-green amounts to
mania. And although this girl had a neck like
Briseis (the damsel who caused some unpleasant-
ness between two old-world Greek princes), she
showed further artistic restraint by not wearing
any gauds on it.
Talking of hair : Miss Anglin’s sister, who came
in with the T. H. Kellys, has a fine, riotous sur-
plus of russet locks. She disfigured them on this
occasion with hoardings of wide pink ribbon. The
feminine half of the W. P. Manning family was
in the circle, where it had a grand view of. a box
of visiting Chinese statesman, secretary, and
Japanese hosts. Mr. Lin (he has several other
names) and his friends were in European evening
dress. They leant out of the box at times and
applauded with discrimination. Mrs. J.C.W.,
wrapped in ermine, and some Wills-Allens in-
habited boxes, and the Shipmans and Waldrons
were in the lower regions—the stalls.
If persons who have intractable coughs would
but stop away from theatres! A gentleman in
the stalls was evidently under the delusion that
he was a horse, and the reserved stalls a livery
stable, and that his oats had gone the wrong way.
From a man about a man :
Dear Akeneiii,—What python story are you handing- us
about J.C.W.’s private secretary going to Auckland to
meet the Fleet and represent his boss in the entertain-
ment thereof? J.O.VV. has no more to do with the
Fleet at Auckland than has Conductor Croucher, in
whose honor the tramway strike has been .stroked.
Claude McKay went to the I-lauraki gulf city to try to
find lodgings for the forty-three girls in the pantomime
co. that opens there presently. Auckland is as crowded
as Sydney will be in August. Not a hollow tree or a vacant
boiler on a wharf to be found.
Well, the statement that the gentleman was
going to whoop on .behalf of Mr. J.C.W. at the
•Fleet reception wasn’t intended to be taken so
seriously as all that. It was mainly based on the
feeling that Mr. Williamson is an Institution, and
should be represented. Anyhow, Claude has a
more difficult job than being' (say) Seventy-Third
Assistant Tickler to the White Armada. If he
trails around with the forty-three damsels follow-
ing him, knocking at doors and “inquiring
within ” for lodgings for the queue, he and it will
certainly be mistaken for the Chief of Salt Lake
City and Collective Wife. Negatives and missiles
are what he’ll get from the outraged householder.
According to a Herald advt. of last week, a
groom wants to enter the service of “ a gentleman
or a doctor.” Discriminating groom! Talking
of' doctors, I notice that one of them (in
London) is “bad up” for marrying eleven
wives. Medical men of to-day, like King Solomon
and other of them early Jews, have some blessed
privileges.
Ninety-eight percent, of Sydney women and girls
are carrying trallywag bags and knitted silk neck
scarves, mostly in shades of green. The bags are
of tinted leather, with leather fringe of unequal
lengths. They look like the medium-sized dead
octopoda that one sees occasionally hanging in a
Dago’s fish shop, with all the limp fevers drooping
unequally. Scarf-wearing seems to have started
at the Glaciarium. There was some reason for it
at the Place of the Frozen Floor, where the cold
skateress needed something to cover her neck and
her one-and-threepenny string of pearls. The
one woman in the hundred who doesn’t wear a
scarf —silk, wool, or colored cotton —explains that
“ they were just going out of fashion when I left
England a year ago.”
The Masonic ball.was so brilliant and specta-
cular a function that only the arrival of the Fleet
will fog over the memory of it. Messrs. Shipway
and Heighway and others, who engineered the
event, must see medals on their chests.
Seven concerts on one day ! On August 24,
M?. Southwell is to manage that number—two in
the Town Hall, five in the Domain. He has sent
to Auckland to secure, if possible, an American
Fleet officer to meet Colonel Roth in sword-play.
Five new contraltos rolled up to ask for a
hearing at Paling’s on one day last week. The
whole musical-box of girls seems to be crazy to
sing during Fleet week. One was a pretty
woman from Gisborne (M.L.), who has been
studying abroad ; another was a daughter of Mr.
W. E. Baker, the actor; a third, Miss Eda
Brischka, a Polish girl, whom none ever heard of
before, rather startled the song-weary experts.
She got an engagement to sing at to-morrow’s
Hospice Ball.
Mrs. Plunkett, only sister and heiress of the
late Mr. Tom Lawry, died last week. She
weighed some 30st.
Mr. “Dick” Horsfall and his bride (who was
Miss Ada Fosbery before the horse fell) have
deposited their swags in a London flat—Clarges-
street, Piccadilly, is the exact location. They are
surrounded by absentee Australians. The Hamil-
ton Osbornes have a house in Cadogan Square,
the Ernest Watts a flat in Hans Place, the Pat
Osborne dame an establishment further west, and
smaller and less radiant lights of Sydney and
Melbourne Society pervade most of the big hotels.
Federation has done a good deal towards driving
Society out of the country. Since Federation,
Society has been making so much money that it
has to travel to places like London and Paris
(where they really do know how to charge) to get
a chance of spending it.
The Australian young man seems to make good
in most parts of the world he visits. At Edin-
burgh’s big University Mr. Gordon Weston, of
Sydney, has achieved honor passes in each exam,
he has assailed hitherto ; and in addition has been
selected to represent his University at cricket.
Mr. Weston is a brother of the trio of pretty
sisters who married a Laidley, a Dangar, and a
Watt respectively.
A couple of bright pew stars in Sydney’s social
firmament are the Sep. Levys. They abode till
lately in Newcastle (N.S.W.), where the male
constellation ran racehorses, businesses (he is rich
beyond the dreams of most of us) and other in-
considerable trifles. They have the Walter Brun-
tons’ house on Bellevue Hill till that pleasing
couple returns, and after that they will settle per-
manently in one or other of the abandoned homes
of our old nobility. The lady wears Paquin
frocks and has some of the best diamonds in
Sydney.
Professor Carslaw comes not out of the ex-
tinguishment of his widowerhood. Rose Bay-leaves
wilt for a sight of him, but the House of Mirth
he shuns, and divides his time between the Uni.
and his own black-leaded humpy, where his sister
runs his mathematical household. He used to add
so much to the gaiety of this nation that he is
missed enormously.
Mrs. William Thompson Starr, who was Aus-
tralia’s Elsie Moore, is making good in N’Yark
society with the characteristic vim of the local
feminine product. The World (10/6/’08) stars a
reception that was given in her honor last month
by her glad parents-in-law, whereat 500 guests
attended, and the entire decorations were of Aus-
tralian wattle-yellow. Imitation wattles were
made out of U.S.A. spring blossoms—an easy job
in a country where roast shoulder of lamb, cun-
ningly fashioned out of Oregon pine, is no un-
common feature of the “down-town” restaurant
menu.
The Asturias, the largest British mail steamer
in the Pacific trade, will be out here again early next
year. This is good news for luxurious persons
with leanings towards silk and rose-point lace
bed-spreads. The (Dr.) John Hay pair and the
Hector Carruthers brace reposed under the
silk and lace of the Asturias, and in each case the
male reposer got knighted on arrival—so there
may be luck in travelling by the' craft. “Crows’
Nest,” the Hay mansion at North Sydney, is to
be let. Probably the wanderers are not to be
back for some time.
Lieutenant Evans, who will have the icy honor
and risky job of taking the Nimrod South Pole-
ward in November to pick up the Shackleton
bunch, is a brass-bound young R.N. Reservist on
the Takapuna, a vessel that haunts the M.L.
coasts. He has ama and a sister (Mrs. Stockfeldt)
living in Mosman.
“Mario,” from Brisbane :
It is a warm heart, after all, that beats under the
bodice of the vice-regal lady. At her special request the
Government House grounds were overrun by something
under 100 blind, deaf and dumb scholars, and by the com-
mittees and nurses of the various hospitals. The infants
enjoyed themselves vastly. There was a Punch and Judy
show for the blind, and a visit to the bear pits for the
others, with a solid tea to follow.
At the Lamington Hospital Annual, on Friday, much
fear was expressed by some persons, who had got the
State Frights disease in a bad form, that Federal Treasurer
Lyne might come down like the bear on the fold and
snatch away the well-earned credit balance ; and it took
the combined efforts of certain level-headed citizens to
prevent the committee from withdrawing the money
instanter, and putting it away carefully in a tea-caddy for
better preservation, and burying the caddy in the back
garden. The much-abused hospital treated something
like 280 patients during the year, with only four deaths.
His Ex. is to arrive back from his Northern wanderings
on Tuesday, with, I hear, a ruined complexion and nearly
a stone more of solid Ex.
It is strange how the almighty Cow, like the pestilences
of old, overspreads this land. There was a picture show
here this week, given by the junior students of the Art
Society. (They style themselves the “ Wogs.”) Now that
poor little show was just covered with Cow. Cow gleamed
at you out of a thunderstorm, and snored at you upon
the hillside. Cow provided the forefront for every second
paddock-scape, and glowered at you from a milking yard.
It was no wonder that Mrs. Cowley, who declared the
affair open, requested a cup of tea without milk. She
was trying to escape from Cow.
Another daughter of Mr. R. M. Collins has announced
her engagement. This is Miss Mabel (No. 3), and the fortu-
nate man is J. W. Ralston, of the Q. N. Bank, Beau-
desert,
News reaches me that Eunice Lucas, a local pianist
who narrowly escaped the travelling scholarship carried
off by Hilda Roberts, is doing good work at Trinity,
London. Two of her compositions have been chosen for
the college orchestra, and she herself has performed at
almost all the college shivoos. Her father is a medical
person with a vast belief in the paw-paw fruit as a cure for
many diseases. He also has a leaning or slope towards
politics.
I hear upon sound authority that the Attorney-General
will lead a procession of motor cars down to the shores of
your harbor, via the Northern Rivers, to welcome Uncle
Sam. Apart from the fact that we ought to be repre-
sented when the feet of Jonathan are beautiful upon the
shore, the jolly little man who went to Cloncurry in the
car would be worth a view all to himself. We are con-
sidering the advisability of presenting him with the free-
dom of Nerang, en route, as a set-off against Premier
Kidston’s proceedings at his native Falkirk.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, July 27, 1908.
My Dear Yarrie, —
As far as Victorian girls are concerned, The
Lone Hand came to the end of its Beauty Quest
last Friday afternoon, when ten flesh and blood
realities, chosen on their photograph attractions,
wes6 invited to meet a Board of judges in the vast
refreshment hall of Olympia (Melb.). The
ceremony of a final judging was conducted on tea-
party lines, a small table being set apart for each
Beauty and her chaperon. No better or more
private place could have been picked for this
unique gathering of rivals. It gave them
abundant space in which to conceal their blushes
from even their nearest neighbors, and plenty of
scope for taking observations along with their
tea. Cheerfully lighted and warmed for the
occasion, the airy edifice presented a much more
West Picturesque appearance than is its ordinary
matinee worn;. Each competitor in turn was
summoned to an interview with the judges in
manager Miller’s office, and having survived the
awful ordeal she went back to her own particular
tea table to soothe her nerves. The judges were
E. Phillips Fox, artist; Dr. Atkinson Woods;
Clarence Weber, physical culture expert; Miss
Rubinstein; and Edmund Fisher (representing
The Lone Hand). After they had deliberated a
while in their sanctum, they came forth amidst
the tea tables to exercise some more judgment,
what time Miss Miller administered souvenir
gifts to the ten heroines, who finally dispersed in
a state of lively curiosity as to which of them had
won the distinction of being It. Results of this and
other State judgments will be announced in The
Lone Hand.
A'Beauty Competition appeals, seemingly, to
the tenderest feelings of the commercial heart.
The firm of Borsdorff and Co. sent embroidered
handkerchiefs for the contestants; Rocke, Tompsitt
and Co. rounded off the compliments with a
bottle of perfume for each mouchoir; and the
agent for Dutch chocolates pleaded for a post-
ponement of the judging because he was “out”
of the special sweets he fain would have given to
the sweet. The souvenirs from The Lone Hand
were offered as a matter of courtesy to the ten
nice girls who had so valiantly presented themselves
in the face of heavy odds. By the way, one of
thei», and only one, seized an early opportunity
to flee from Beauty’s Bower. She came, she was
seen, but she gave herself no chance to conquer
in what was practically the “final round” of the
contest, viz., the round of inspection by the judges.
Phillips Fox and his bright little wife are re-
turning to Paris next month. Before they go the
lady member of the firm will exhibit her own little
lot of oil paintings to the world that lately ex-
pressed its approval of her husband’s work in a
practical manner. Mrs. Fox has about 40
pictures to submit, small canvases for the most
part, and she will hang them at Bernard’s Gallery
in Collins-street, where Hal Waugh gave his show.
Some of them have been exhibited in Paris, others
were painted during her recent visit to Sydney,
and altogether they should be an attractive dis- :
play. On Monday they will be prepared to
receive press notice.
Lord Mayor Weedon —lauded be his name !
has made a presentation to the Melbourne City
Council in token of Ins greatness. The gift is
thoroughly characteristic of the donor, for it is a
portrait of himself in oils —a full-length, life-size
portrait. Unfortunately it depicts him in his
robes. Weedon in his invariable long frock coat
and belltopper it should have been. There is no
recorded instance of the pushful little person
having been seen apart from his frock coat, except
when he was revelling in those robes of office. He
will probably go up to Heaven in his frock coat,
and the lengthy tails thereof will assist him to fly
around with proper dignity.
A desirable widower surprised the commercial
world, the other week, by quietly lapsing into
matrimony. The unexpected bridegroom in
question was Councillor Frank Davies, managing
director of Gordon and Gotch, and he disobeyed
the injunction of Mr. Weller, senior, by marrying
a widow —Mrs. Kinsella. The bride has one
child by her first marriage—a 10-year-old son,
who will inherit a fortune when he arrives at 21.
The wedding was so quietly arranged that the
happy pair had got away to Bendigo before their
friends in general knew that they were bonded.
There was a wedding at Christ Church, South
Yarra, last week, which marked the retirement of
one of the graceful Klos Sisters from the hori-
zontal bar business. The bride was the bonnie
Scottish lassie of the Klos sisterhood—the Miss
McKlos. She married Mr. Bond, the clever young
mechanist, who works the biograph at the
Rickards show in Melbourne, and who, in fact,
built the apparatus. The bridegroom is only 26,
and he promises to turn his inventive talent to
great account one of these days.
Amongst the anecdotes which fine old Tom
Fitzgerald’s death recalls is one which relates to
the Icicle Lady of Linlithgow. Long, long ago,
when the son and heir of Hopetoun was an ill-
used little kid who was never allowed to make
mud-pies or play marbles, he fell sick. Thomas
was called in to cure the youngster. One bright
morning, in seeing his patient under the eye of
his haughty mamma, Surgeon Thomas apostro-
phised the infant as “my little man.” “‘Lord
Hope.’ if you please,” corrected the countess.
“ By Heaven, madam, you are ridiculous,” quoth
the other little man, and gave up the case forth-
• with. He used to recount the episode, with many
gibes, until he was reconciled to the arrogant
dame.
The shock of the week was the sudden death of
Dr. James Mclnerney, of Fitzroy. Only a few
days ago he caught a chill which took on a deadly
aspect within a very short time, and ended a fine
life. Dr. Mclnerney was one of the few men who
are completely popular, and he deserved all his
popularity. He was clever and charming as only
an Irishman can be, and kindly and helpful and
wise. With his nephew, Dr. Kelly, he kept a
hospitable house, to which was bidden a long list
of intellects, and the Mclnerney supper-parties
were, more often than not, occasions to be
chronicled with an admiring pen. The deceased
was fairy-godfather to a host of ministering
angels. To those at Melbourne Hospital he gave
a tennis-court; to the girls at the Alfred he was
unvaryingly generous, just as he was to every
friend and any supplicant. His fifty-six years
were more than one would have suspected, con-
sidering his buoyancy and verve.
A man supplies me with this (I wasn’t there):
“Victorian artists held their annual smoke-
freeze last Saturday night, and maintained their
grim respectability to the bitter end. There was
certainly plenty of beer, served up poetically in
glass jugs, and cigars (for the high priests of the
inner sanctuary), but the proceedings were other-
wise about as savagely Bohemian as a diabolo
tournament. Said proceedings happened, appar-
ently by accident, about 8.30 p.m., and embraced a
programme of songs, etc., and the inevitable,
unnecessary remarks of Chairman Mather, who
relieved himself of much pedantic snuffle.
He referred to the press, not in terms of
adoration —and, among other things, suggested
that artists painted for their own pleasure.
He also published some tasteless and contemptu-
ous reflections on women in art, and the women,
not being admitted to smoke concerts, were unable
to retaliate with remarks upon Mather. For the
rest —the vocalists and musicians, to wit —they
mostly suppressed their geniality with firm hands,
and were as festive as monks. It wasn’t their
fault, poor bloques ! They had to warble ‘ Deep,
Deep Down ! ’ ‘ Watchman, What of the Night ? ’
and such-like mirthful trifles—and mostly did their
darnedest. But there were too many of those
morbid persons, and too few of the Sidney Mer-
ton brand— S.M. himself being by contrast as
bright and hilarious as a Thornton farce. Also,
the atmosphere of smoke and timid beeriness
seemed sad and unconvincing when another
gentleman declaimed an extract from ‘ Romeo
and Juliet.’ Still, I would have forgiven all of
that if it hadn’t been for other things.”
Nowadays, matinee parties are becoming a
vogue amongst the hospitable folk who can afford
friends. Also, they’re becoming a nuisance to
the humble females who can only manage theatre
seats now and again. T’other day, at “Mrs.
Wiggs,” I struck one example of the horrors of
this form of private entertainment. Sidling
quietly into an unobtrusive seat, I found myself
behind a wall of hair and hats, which grew ever
more dense as the show went on. One woman
wore a picture hat with an infant emu sprawling
across it; another, a toque with a bantam fowl
perched on either side of it. A third was obese
and ancient, and so hugely tall that her shoulders
obscured the heads in front of her. And these
inflictions kept on coming in late and gushfully
greeting each other, until one longed to dismember
their hats and erections of hair. A lady in my
neighborhood performed a public duty with some
distinction. Leaning forward, she spoke to a
chief offender over an intervening two rows, say-
ing, “ Tike off yer ’at. please.” Answered merely
by a withering stare, she said much louder,
“Y’orter! Yer hair’s cornin’ off, and you’ll lose
them expensive curls if yer don’t put yer pins in
again. And any’ow I’ll call for an usherer if you
won’t let me see.” The supercilious lady quietly
removed her hat.
The Caledonian Society gave its annual feast of
song on Thursday, and as usual the feast took place
in the Town Hall. The Society committed an inno-
vation this year. Instead of having Scotch-jigging
kiddies in kilts as the main attraction, Alberto
Zelman’s orchestra and Lilian Reid and a bari-
tone bawler lent tone to the proceedings. The
orchestra played quantities of Hamish McCunn,
and Mendelssohn’s Hebrides Overture, and a wild
whirl of caterwauls described as a Scottish Rhap-
sddv. It was very dreadful. Scotch proceedings
are always tainted with local color, and it’s a
nasty, hodden-grey shade, with squeaks and
shrieks in it. Horace Stevens sang more Scotchness
lugubriously, and Lilian Reid sang more, shrilly.
Afterwards the people drifted out into a Scotch
mist in Collins-street. I was aggrieved—when I’d
been soaked by the mist and sodden by the music—
that, by reason of my sex and my size, the only
variety of Scotch that doesn’t depress was denied
to me. The audience was excessively pleased with
itself and the concert, and it was exceedingly
Scotch. It said “Hoots,” and “Gude, mon,”
and other strange sounds. Gaelic members of
Parliament from all over Victoria might have
been seen there, also their wives and their
constituents.
The Princess Ida Club—the chooky-junior
club of the University—gave its annual cluck-
clucking in Wilson’s Hall last week. The chance-
Excellency and Dame Madden were guests-in-
chief, and all the graduate hostesses blossomed in
hoods and gowns. There was a plethora of talk and
a little song, and Di Gilio, with his sentimental
eyes rolling, waved some incidental music from
his orchestra.
The A.I.D.E. (which is not a Gentleman Help,
but a cooking and otherwise domestic institute)
is reaching the top of its first hill. The final dash
of the session before the examinations was a cook-
ing demonstration by "Miss Pell. Miss Pell is a
Boss Cook ; she might almost be called a boshter
cook. She gives cooking lessons at 14 different
centres connected with State schools, and knows
the sure difference between a real egg and the
degraded imposture which is only egg powder.
Competitors for the cookery exam, must send in
their names before the end of July. It seems
worth while to buck in, for the reward of success
is a scholarship entitling the winner to 12 months’
tuition free. And much lies beyond that, for the
girl who can cook has the world at her feet, and
her doormat is worn to tatters with the struggling
boots of men who want to marry her and be her
tootsy-wootsy for ever afterwards.
Lovely woman is certainly rushing man’s jobs
with a vengeance. Miss E. M. Wilson, of this
city, has now gained a certificate as boiler-
attendant under the Vic. Factories Act. If Miss
Wilson had got a certificate as a fryingpan
attendant, your Johanna would feel much more
inclined to tear a feather out of her hat and wave
a “ Hooray.”
Now we know which particular Mrs. Living-
stone Learmonth it is that made a sensation in
England lately by marrying the ancient Portman
Viscount —she was 70 or so, and he a gay buck of
no more than 80. “Formerly of Ercildoun, Vic-
toria,” says one notice. Then she was one of the
pioneer Ounninghames, of Gippsland ; you can
find their name on the map. There were three or
four daughters, and they owned a large share of
the good looks of the Victoria of 50 years back.
The Learmonths came to Tasmania close upon 100
years ago ; and in 1837 two of the second genera-
tion, Thomas and Somerset, came exploring to
Victoria. That is how they got Ercildoun, which,
years after, they sold to “ Salmon ” Wilson. This
Widow Livingstone Learmonth’s husband was
that particular Livingstone Learmonth who
fought the tremendous law-battle over the owner-
ship of the Egerton mine, at Ballarat, 30-odd
years ago. Lawyers still smack their lips over it.
The heart of fashionable femininity is fluttered
by the return of Mrs. Brookes. That lady is the
presiding artiste of the showrooms at the Buckley
and Nunn-ery, and as the result of her latest trip
to Paris she has brought back a number of striking
creations and “ tender dreams ” in costumes and
millinery—things to be viewed with agitation
and talked of in strains of ecstasy.
The Weston string quartet, assisted by Miss
Una Bourne, and in conjunction with Mrs.
Ohristesen, concerted in Glen’s Hall on Wednes-
day. The quartet, which is a bulky, bespectacled
arrangement of fat and elderly gentlemen, played
two numbers —Haydn’s No. 2 in F major, and
a Schumann quintet, in which Una Bourne made
her piano do most noble duty. The quartet is by
no means what it might be. George Weston’s
strident tone doesn’t lend itself to concerted
chamber music, and Schieblich, too, manages to
get a sawmill “color ” which is unpleasing. But
Hattenbach with his ’cello, and Herman Schrader
with his, do much to mitigate the sins of their other
half. Really the interest of the series is reliant upon
the petticoated part of the programme. Una
Bourne, always a charming artist, played, on the
last occasion, a Brahms bracket, which was worth
hearing at the price of a pilgrimage. And then
she encored with an ineffably quaint scrap by Ola
Ollson—beautiful as the play of pretty children.
Mrs. Christesen divided her efforts into two
sections. One was a cluster of British folk-songs,
rendered with most sympathetic charm. The
other bunch was by Sibelius, Sinding, and Heise.
A fairly full house was on view. Miss Olga
Clauscen and Jeremias Josephi were two under-
standing auditors. And Max Schliiter—who
alternately looks like a brooding muse and a
friendly monkey—sat with a set of Danes. Mrs.
Miller, very gorgeously arrayed, lived up to her
reputation for enthusiasm. And religious Pro-
fessor Sugden, coming in late, proceeded without
delay to advertise his knowledge by sundry
comments.
From “Rosna,” in Premier Price’s town, on the
Torrens:—
Adelaide has been pounding the loud timbrel ever since
it got its Premier home again on the 20th. The morning of
his arrival the whole of the city’s officialdom tore headlong
to the Outer Harbor to meet him. The first batch arrived
at 8 a.m., though it was nearly 12 before the travellers
appeared. The Speaker Coles people were there, the
Chief Secretary Kirkpatricks, the Treasurer Peakes, the
Butlers, the High Commissioners of Everything, the
whole Ministry, a large slice of Parliament, a few hundred
presidents and secretaries of things, a batch or two of
Mayors, and, in fact, the whole blessed show. Then the
Premier was carted off to town and lunched at Parliament
House.
Sardines were a back number to the vast throng that
scrambled for room at the public reception in the Town
Hall the same afternoon. There wasn’t an inch of floor
visible for clothes and feet, and the circle was packed
with a frilly throng of women. On the platform was the
same crowd of officials as hereinbefore mentioned, only
more so. A notable figure was the popular Archbishop
O’Reily, who is rarely seen at such functions nowadays,
by reason of his ill-health.
Same night the mayoral H. W. Varleys gave a ball at
Glenelg in the Premier’s honor, and some 400 or 500
expensively-dressed folk rushed to the local town hall.
The place was garbed in wattle blossom and many gold
streamers, and the Prices’ arrival was heralded by the
playing of “ The Song of Australia ” (our national song,
so don’t deny it). Later, after the Mayor’s speech of
welcome, the guests joined in warbling the same
ditty. The Mayoress, Mrs. Varley, was frocked in butter-
cup taffeta, with bretelles of sequined passementerie ;
and Mrs. Price wore an old gold satin raiment with a
glorious overdress of black chiffon embroidered in gold
half-way up the skirt and all over the bodice. It is said
this was the gown in which she bowed to Queen Alexan-
dra of Britain. Two jolly young daughters came with
her —one just grown-up ; the other still in that short-
frocked stage in which the tops of the boots are re-
vealed, and both daintily arrayed in simple white and
Valenciennes. Adelaide’s Mayoress, Mrs Mayfield, was
garbed in lovely floral silk and point lace, and her
daughter was a heavenly decoration in pale yellow satin.
The Speaker Coles’ damsel, Ruth, wore a graceful empire
gown of cream silk gauze with orange velvet on the
kimono sleeves ; and another smart confection was sported
by Mrs. Jule Wendt—a scarlet raiment with daring purple
pansies on the bodice. The enthusiastic entertainment
of the returned travellers will be continued until further
notice.
Forty merry Norwood maidens joined forces and
moidores one night last week, with the result that
several hundred persons danced till next day in a peach-
blossom bower, that might have been carried bodily out
of the picture of an old Babylonian glory and set down
in South Oss for the occasion. For amateur decoration it
was a triumph. Pa’s garden was looted to the extent of
several miles of asparagus fern, which vegetable mag-
nificence was festooned and forwards, and in
and out and round about, over the ceiling of the ballroom;
and 40,000 barrow-loads of pink peach-blossom, manu-
factured by the hostesses’ own gentle white hands, grew
out of the walls, and twined the sombre stage into fairy-
land. Great masses of the same blossom hung from each
chandelier, and an arch of tall palm leaves marched up
the staircase to the supper-room, where pink was again
the color note. In a land beset with committee dances
the Norwood damsels’ charming and festive undertaking
certainly carries off the whole load of palms. There were
sundry notable chiffons present. Mrs. Hayward wore a
beauteous silver-sequined robe over pale lavender, and
her daughter a gorgeous, embroidered, cobwebby chiffon
over palest blue.
Miss Lucy Hall was garbed in a white embroidered
glace, latticed with silver braid ; and a pretty Houlgrave
maiden had a white net, with infant rosebuds woven into
it. The J. M. Blacks’ chick wore a raiment of dewy
handpainted mist over a pink sunset; and Miss Lucy
Sholl was in a dainty and heavenly garment of blue
taffeta.
After long waiting, Adelaide has recaptured its old
friend, Beatrice Day. She and Herbert Flemming, with his
“ Humming Bird ” in tow, reached these shores on Satur-
day, just as Mrs. Brough and Monty Brewster Kingston
took their millions elsewhere. A crowd of eager persons
were at the station to shake Miss Day by the upper limb,
and she was carted off in triumph to the South Australian
Hotel. This remindeth me that we’re to have a Players’
Club, for the fostering of amateur mumming genius.
There have already been sundry enthusiastic meetings.
Percy Walshe, once manager with the Broughs, is to be
producer and director of the performances, and the club
has announced its intention of renting commodious
apartments.
A brilliant son of this humble but deserving State,
Geoffrey Duffield, has just had a Doctor of Science degree
forced upon him by the Victoria University of Manchester
(England). For some years the clever youth has been
engaged in research work at the Manchester laboratories
on the “ effect of pressure upon arc spectra.” I don’t
know what these things are, but they sound large and
profound and great, and they reflect credit on our State.
A paragraph concerning sculptor Web. Gilbert,
in “Melbourne Chatter” (July 16), conveyed a
wrong idea of the origin and personal significance
of his charming design, entitled “Love and
Death.” The writer said: “His wife is repre-
sented as the native companion guarding her
babies from Death—the snake. The group
attracted the attention of Dr. Springthorpe, who
purchased it, and intends placing it with the
McKenna! group over the grave of his beautiful
wife.” As a matter of fact, “ Love and Death ”
was the execution of a commission received from
Dr. Springthorpe. Web. Gilbert chose the
design for the subject, and it is the late Mrs.
Springthorpe, not the artist’s wife, who is repre-
presented (or rather symbolised) as the mother
guarding her young while Death,, the snake, is
about to strike at her.
Yours affectionately,
J OHANNA.

A. J. SOUTAR, Accountant.
Sydney, 10th July, 1908.
We hereby certify that we have examined the bills, compared the balances, and counted the coin in the Head
•ffice of THE COMMERCIAL BANKING COMPANY OF SYDNEY, LIMITED, and have compared the returns of the
ranches, and have found the same as specified in the foregoing- Balance-sheet.
The following resolutions were carried unanimously :
E. S. CAPE
F. VV. HIXSON,
j- Auditors.
“That the Report and Statements of Account be received and adopted, and ordered to be circulated among
the Proprietors.”
“That E. W. Knox, Esq., and A. J. Onslow Thompson, Esq., be elected Directors of the Bank.”
“That F. W. Hixson, Esq., and W. L. Docker, Esq., be appointed Auditors for the ensuing year.”
“ That the thanks of the Shareholders be presented to the Directors, General Manager, and Officers of the
Bank for their very satisfactory management of the affairs of the institution.”
T. A. DIBBS, General Manager.
The Chairman, Mr. G. J. Cohen, in proposing the adop-
tion of the Report, said : I am pleased to be able to state
that the business has been well maintained during the
half-year, with the gratifying result that there has been
satisfactory increase in the Bank’s earnings. Comparing
the figures, as we usually do, with those of twelve
months ago, it will be seen that the totals show an ex-
pansion of £564,000. On the debit side, the increases
are :—Capital, £36,000 ; Reserve Fund, £47,000 ; Deposits
and other Liabilities, £1,134,000 ; Profit and Loss, £22,000 ;
while Bills in Circulation, which always fluctuate, have
decreased £364,000. The note circulation is practically
unchanged. Turning to the credit side, the principal
fluctuations are :—Decrease in Coin, £200,000 ; Bills Re-
ceivable and Remittances in Transit, £591,000; Short
Loans in London, £200,000 ; but our holding of Govern-
ment Debentures has gone up £348,000. This additional
amount is caused by our having taken advantage of the
very favorable opportunity lately offering in London for
the purchase of this class of security to replace some shortly
maturing. Our lendings, under the heading of Bills Dis-
counted and Other Debts due to the Bank, have increased
to the extent of £1,501,000. The Paid Up Capital of the
Bank is at present £1,250,000, and the reserve profits
£1,277,000. Our Liquid Assets represent a proportion of
9s. 2d. in the £to our liabilities to the Public. You will
notice with regret the retirement of the Honorable Richard
.Jones, M.L.C., on account of ill-health. He was a director
for 16 years, having succeeded in 1892 his father, the
late Richard Jones, who was on our Board for 31 years,
and whose eminent services were of great benefit to the
Bank. Owing to the great advance in the business of
the Bank, the Board thinks that the time has arrived
when the capital should be further increased, as by doing
so it will further strengthen our position. It is, there-
fore, proposed that the Bank’s Capital be augmented by
the issue of 20,000 new shares of £l2 10s". each, sav
£250,000, making the paid-up capital £1,500,000, the
shares to be allotted at par in the proportion of one new
share for every five old ones, and to be paid for in four
instalments, payable £3 2s. 6d. per share on the 30th
September and 31st December, 1908, and on the 31st
March and 30th June, 1909—with the proviso that any
shareholder electing to pay all the instalments in full may
have the privilege of doing so, receiving full dividends
from the dates of payment. I have only to remind you
of the great expansion in the business of the State, as
shown lately in the published figures of the Federal
Treasurer for the financial year ending June 30th, the
total revenue collected through the Customs, Post Office,
aud Telephone services amounting to the large sum of
£5,521,000, being 43 per cent, larger than the amount
collected in Victoria. The increase in this State alone
was £1,039,000 for the year, being almost half that of the
other five States of the Commonwealth. You are, of
course, aware of the larger revenue from our railways,
and the great extensions to the various outlying places.
This has urged us to be in readiness to cope with the pro-
gressive business we see ahead. I have now the pleasure
to move the adoption of the Report, and that it be
printed and circulated among the Shareholders.

The State Bank in S. Australia advances on city and sub-
urban as well as country properties ; and, since it gets its
money at a low rate and doesn’t have to pay dividends, it
can oiler terms so liberal that in competing with them
even such an old and well-recommended society as this
can make only very small profits. The society’s scope is
limited also, wherefore its expense rate is comparatively
high. Moreover, it has no borrowed money ; what profit
it makes is entirely from its own funds. Still that has its
compensations—it reduces the risks. Including profit
credited to shareholders, the capital is now £17,300 ; four
years ago it was £19,842. But though the available funds
have been reduced, the balance lying in the bank await-
ing investment is a trifle larger, and now amounts to
£2191. Under all the circumstances it is really surprising
that the society does even as well as it is doing.

This little co. began, as usual, with a very small paid
capital, but is gradually increasing it as new co-operators
come in ; and the total is now £1733. As plant, build-
ings, etc., stand in the books at £4224, that capital is nob
enough ; it means an overdraft of £2618, and even then the
trading capital has to be chiefly represented by “ sundry
creditors”—no doubt unpaid bills for supplies. Under the
circumstances a very cautious policy with regard to
dividends and especially with regard to bonuses is called
for. If co-operators can’t afford to put up sufficient
capital straight out, they should at least be glad to build
up their own concern to a position of independence and
safety by foregoing bonuses for a. while. Yet many co-
operators unfortunately clamor for bonuses before the
concern is really in a position to pay them ; anyway,
while the concern — their concern—is in urgent need of
the money. In this case there ‘is _ all the more
reason for foregoing bonuses, because it is claimed that
“ without exception the values paid for cream each
month have been in excess of advertised market rates,
ranging from |d. to ljd. per lb. ; the extra amount thus
paid to suppliers represents about £1700.” The output
during the past year was 830,2951 b. (371 tons); and the
entire expenses, apart from depreciation, but including
interest, amounted to £6051, which is equal to l'74d. per
lb. ; that is, a shadow under lfd. And the co. does a lot
for the money-including manufacture, packing (£1038),
cold-storing, and marketing.

The dividend, declared every other half-year, is at the
rate of 5 per cent, per annum. During the past term, a
small quantity of butter was exported, and the returns
have not yet been received. Butter-export is a specu-
lative business, on account of the variation in prices
between the time of shipment and sale; yet
there appears to be no special reserve to meet possi-
ble losses. If this business is pursued, such a
reserve ought to be created. The turnover continues to
grow: the output during the 12 months was 642 tons.
The amount provided out of profits to cover depreciation
is equal to 10 per cent, on book value of plant and build-
ings, and other smaller items are also being written off.
The financial position looks very sound: total liabilities
amount to £5412, while on the other side liquid assets
total £7815, including £3063 in cash and deposits. The
co. is, however, providing a new factory at Paterson ; on
this account there is a contingent liability of £2956,
Though the co. is only five years old, this extension will
be practically all provided out of the undivided profits
from the parent factory ; and this in spite of the fact that
the shareholders have had 5 per cent, for their money,
while suppliers, besides getting market value for their
produce, have lately also been getting a bonus of id. per
lb. out of the savings which have resulted from co-opera-
tive working.

“Cu.”: Concerning smelting charges and
“Denyah’s” troubles (B. 18/6/’OS). As a general rule,
Australian producers are not treated very badly by local
customs smelters, judging by the results from the'only
other available means of disposing of the ore—selling
to European buyers. Have often had occasion to com-
pare the results of such sales, and find that, although
the European tenders are presented in a more palatable
form, the net result works out little, if any, better than
that got from local smelters. The small producer invari-
ably has a grievance against the Australian smelting co.,
and this is aggravated by the habit these buyers have of
chopping off a bit here and there from the assay values,
and capping this with a heavy treatment charge. For
example, take a copper ore containing silver lOoz. per
ton. First, there is a deduction of 3oz. for losses. Next,
only 90 per cent, of the net contents are paid for (equal to
6'Soz. per ton—but the decimal must be lopped off).
That leaves 6oz. paid for. With European buyers, the
original assay value is usually untouched, and the deduc-
tion is made in one lump under the comprehensive style
of “returning charge.” A few pence per unit soon
makes up for the continual nibbling at the values, and
the system does not worry the seller nearly so much.
Fortunately, we have not yet such apparently genuine
cause for protest as the sellers in the Western States of
America. There, practically the whole of the customs
smelting is in the hands of a Trust, which adopts various
adroit methods to forestall competition. One of the most
serious charges made against the buyers there concerns
their refusal to pay for ore in less than 45 days or two
months from date of treatment. Evidence is given that
in a certain section smelters would be owing on the whole
to producers anything up to £300,000, and having the free
use of the interest on that sum. If this is' true, it is
certainly carrying things a bit far, and any Australian co.
which withholds only 30 per cent, is comparatively
generous. It is the usual practice for European buyers to
keep back 10 per cent, of the value pending receipt of
final account sales from Europe ; but the Australian de-
duction of 30 per cent, for contingencies is not likely to
be continued when competition cuts the rates.
Shareholders in the Union, Diamond Creek
(Vic.), seem to be a long-suffering and sanguine people.
The co. was formed five years ago, and re-formed after
all the contributing capital had been exhausted, since
when the 30,000 share-holders have suffered on equal
terms. At the end of three years or more a change of
management was arrived at. Under the old regime the
mine had been cleared of its ancient water, the usual pre-
diction of rich stone at the bottom level had been falsified,
and the mine manager was preparing to drive south for
the old South Union shoot, which was rich enough 30
years ago. The new management, instead of driving
south, where the only big possibilities lie, has been pot-
tering around the original workings north of the shaft,
near to the boundary of the Diamond Creek mine. Here
there was no room for any considerable success. Now it
it promised that they will drive south, and another flat-
tering tale will be submitted to call-payers. The shares
have been almost valueless on the market from the out-
set, whilst the neighboring Diamond Creek mine has
risen in favor. This latter show' has something to say for
itself. It has turned out £ll,OOO of gold during the
past half-year. The Union, on the other hand, has
yielded, according to the published accounts, £4812 of
gold in the past six months ; but that has not been
enough to meet expenses, and the debit at profit and loss
is £3566, independent of £3373 which has been credited
to development. And as the development hasn’t
developed anything payable, that may as well be written
off, and the total loss to date put at £6939. If' it is
claimed that the best that is possible has been done with
the mine so far, it seems about time to consider whether
the whole thing shouldn’t be wound up, the assets sold,
and the incessant call-paying ended.


T° DA TE ten thousand five hundred and ninety Beale Pianos have
been sold in Australia, New Zealand\ Fiji, Samoa, Norfolk Island,
India, China, Ceylon, Mauritius, South Afidea, and ’ judging by the
warm letters of approval daily received by us, they are giving universal
satisfaction. The reason for this is that every detail in the manufacture of
our pianos is carried out with the most painstaking care, and the instruments
embody many unique features which increase the excellence of the musical
qualities as well as the durability of the instrument. Our factories at
Annandale include thirty different departments in which we carry on more of
the actual processes of piano manufacture than any other piano-makers in the
world. By making all details in our own factories we obtain full control of the
quality throughout; by seasoning the timber in a tropical climate it is better fitted
to withstand the ravages of a hot and variable atmosphere; by building the
cabinet-work on our patented system of cross-plied stock the danger of warping
and cracking is obviated; by our secret process for fortifying the sounding-board
that part of the instrument is rendered secure against climatic influence ; by the
use of a metal instead of a wooden wrest-plank what has hitherto been the
weakest part of all pianos is now (in the Beale Pianos) the strongest and most
durable part.
As to the tonal qualities of the Beale A ustralian Pianos, perhaps the most
striking evidence is that of people who have bought from us and who have
written us to say that other Beale Pianos have been sold merely through
passers by in the street and visitors at their homes having heard their pianos
played. We can show the originals of such letters to anyone desirous of seeing
them. Below we reproduce one in full as a sample:
The Beale Patent Piano supplied to me is undoubtedly one of the best that I have listened
to. Not only is its tone rich and full, but for general quality and appearance it could not be
surpassed. Your Wallsend agent has sold a couple of the same instruments since I got mine
merely through its being heard from the street. I will have much pleasure in always recom-
mending them to anyone I know who is likely to require one.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The New York to Paris motor race is drawing
to a close, the German Protos car having arrived at Aix-
la-Chapelle, in the Rhine provinces of Prussia. The
Yankee car Thomas is completely out of any chance of
first prize, for when the Protos car was on the Russo-
German frontier the Yankee was at Moscow, and the
third car, the Italian Zust, had just arrived at Tomsk, in
Siberia. These three seem to be all that are left in the
struggle, the others having apparently dropped out or
been swallowed up in the Siberian slush. When the
Yankee got out of his own country his marvellous
superioritj' at once vanished. While in the States,
the farmers used to clear the snow off the roads for
the Yankee car and pile it up again mixed
with rocks to block the foreign cars behind. They also let
down the wire fences to give the Yankee short cuts, and
threatened the foreigners with arrest as trespassers when
they attempted to follow suit. Under equal conditions
the difference between the Yankee and the German car
seems to be just about half a continent—which is a mighty
big margin, when you come to think of it.

The timing arrangements at Brooklands motor-
racing track (England) are the finest in the world, and
declared to be absolutely beyond suspicion. And, accord-
ing to this elaborate mechanism, Nazzaro, in his fearsome
drive on the Fiat against the Napier car, actually traversed
bwo-thirds of a lap, between two timing stations, at
the awful rate of 135 miles an hour. The Napier ear
jovered the same two miles at the rate of 129 miles an
hour. The Napier driver afterwards described the sensa-
tion as “ curious.” The car seemed to stand still, and the
rniverse went roaring past, and all he had to do was to
reep the machine’s head right to prevent it being washed
•ound in the rush of things.

“Magneto”: The trouble struck by Lord
Vernon of Poynton Towers, Cheshire, England(B. 23/7/’08),
when out motoring is hy no means a new brand in Eng-
and. According to the Motor Car Act of 1903, every
motor-car driver is required to take out a driving license,
md after a certain number of offences against the legal
limit of 20 miles per hour, or after any offence against
jlause No. 1 of the Act which makes it illegal for any
motorist to drive to the danger of the public, the J’s.P.
have the right to endorse the license. After a few en-
dorsements—three, I rather fancy—the license can be
suspended for a time, or indefinitely if the lunatic be
considered more than usually dangerous. Licenses have
frequently been suspended. I know of a case where a
well-known professional driver, who is also manager of an
auto-firm in London, had his license hung up so high
that he couldn’t reach it for 12 months, merely because
he sprinted through the town of Slough at a speed of
over 40 miles an hour.

Next Saturday will see the great and much-
talked-of contest between Arnst and Pearce on the Parra-
matta River championship course of three miles 330 yards
from Ryde bridge to Searle’s monument. It is unfortu-
nate that on Saturday last Arnst showed signs of still
suffering from the effects of a recent bout with influenza.
Pearce, on the other hand, is in the pink of condition,
and rowing better and faster than ever. His rowing is
superb, and the boat glides along as though driven
by invisible machinery. On the other side Arnst
rolls like a top-heavy ship in a cyclone, and
looks as though he would go right over at any
moment. But his strength is terrific, and he fairly
lifts the boat out of the,water with each gigantic stroke.
Pearce, for all his splendid health and condition, is not in
the same rank as regards muscular power. But unfortu-
nately for Arnst, muscular power is not the deciding
factor in sculling contests, as Hanlan proved to the
world. Pearce’s jump is phenomenal, and comparable to
that mighty bike leap with which Arnst won the Sydney
Thousand, when he went over the line, yelling “ I’ve won
it I’ve won it! ” The only difference is that Pearce’s
water jump takes place at the start of the race, and
whether he can repeat it at the end of a three miles
struggle is known only to the gods—and they
won’t tell. Certain it is that on present showing
Pearce, with his wondrous gliding movement, ought to
show the way for the first mile and a half or two miles.
And the question is whether he can last the rest of the
distance sufficiently well to maintain his lead of the
mighty heaver who'will come rolling through the water
in pursuit. #
Arnst’s appearance over the sculling horizon
has been somewhat astounding. When he won the
Sydney Thousand he had never been in an outrigger. A
number of Maoriland admirers who believed he had the
makings of a great oarsman inside his clothes sent him
across to Sydney to be trained; and straightway Dick
beo-an to fall overboard with monotonous regularity.
Then he managed to balance himself, and pulled boat
after boat to pieces. His first really fast work was one
day when a shark, with an admiring expression in his
dull fishy eye, ranged up alongside and looked as though
he meant making a closer acquaintance. Arnst spurted
as he had never spurted before. He rolled and he wal-
lowed, and the foam and the spume flew, but the boat
tore through the water so fast that the shark had doubts,
and hurried alongside waiting for an opportunity to get
the foam out of his eyes and do the job neatly. And
Dick never gave him a chance. Before Bluenose could
get an opportunity he found himself in danger
of being stranded, and Dick had landed in safety. A
shark is a fine pacemaker; it is said these brutes can
work up to 50 miles an hour for a short sprint.
A most interesting position will be created
should Pearce win on Saturday, and then Arnst cross
over to Maoriland and down Webb for the championship.
And Thoroughgood, also a man of mighty brawn, is lying
on the weather bow, waiting for a chance to chip in and
inquire, “ What’s wrong with me?” *
Some of Fogwell’s friends are saying that after
the foul in his race with Thoroughgood he never tried,
never properly got going, and that in the next shall
see wonders. That would be about the worst thing that
could be said of a sculler —that he didn’t give his backers
an effort for their money. But it is not true. He made
very gallant efforts after the mix up, and the trouble was
not that he ceased trying, but that the other man tried
harder. The spirit was mighty, but the flesh was cooked.
However, Pogwell is a young man yet, and may, in course
of time and training, manage to lift himself to cham-
pionship form, although on Saturday week’s showing he
lacks stamina.

The final match between N.S.W. and Queens-
land Rugby Union teams took place at Sydney Cricket
Ground on Saturday afternoon last, and in spite of the
scarcity of trams over 10,000 people looked on. The word
“ match ”is used by courtesy only. There was no such
thing ; there was a gallop over, a rout, and a wild push-
ing of the other fellow off the premises. At half-time
N.S.W. led by 16 to three. At full time the score had
soared to N.S.W. 21, Queensland six.

The Anglo-Welsh team in Maoriland had no
earthly show against the All Blacks in the Third Test,
and went under by 29 to nil. This is hardly to be
wondered at, as three internationals—Gibbs, Williams,
and Davey—were still too wrecky to play. Almost im-
mediately after the kick off the English captain was
injured, and had to leave the field. As he was not
replaced, it was a case of 15 to 14, and the smaller team was
made up largely of the Anglo-Welsh emergency men. Even
amongst those that did play were men like Vassall and
McEvedv, who ought to have been in a convalescent hos-
nital rather than the three-quarter line. The result was a
foregone conclusion from the start. No less than 25 of the
British team have been injured since the tour began, and
very few' of them are really well yet. The team left for
Sydney on the Monday after the match, and should be
h’eartiiy glad to get away from the land of Rugby furies.
But although everything else on the Maoriland side is
represented as being perfectly lovely, the goal kicking
was hideous. Out of nine tries the Maorilatiders managed
to convert only one. Apparently they are much better
at kicking the visitor than the goal. Maoriland Rugby
wants reforming out of all semblance. If the English
Rugby Union should send another team to Maoriland it
should be composed entirely of men who have learned
the mystery of the Lancashire “purring” match—that
weird old-time form of prize-fight at which there were
four main rules ; (l)kick your enemy when he is up ; (2)
kick him when he is dowm ; (3) kick him anyhow ; (4)
jump on him.
The record of the team has been gloomy. Of 18
matches played seven of the most important were lost.
One was drawn and 10 were won. The visitors scored 208
points to 153, and practically every player in the team
was laid out at one time or another. The manager of the
visiting 1 team, at a banquet at Auckland after the final
test, rubbed brine into the tender hide of the. local
’bailer. He praised the skill, the speed, the splendid
combination, the fearsome brilliance, the magnificent
kicking. And then, pausing, he remarked that the
splendor of these branches of the game was only eclipsed
by the magnificence of the “pointing.” Why they did
it was incomprehensible to him (and everybody else).
They were skilful and strong enough to win without it,
and’he supposed it was merely due to keenness (he pro-
bably meant cussedness).
The Sydney Rugby Union first-grade competi-
tion has reached the interesting stage of the semi-final,
and the four teams left in will play off at Sydney Cricket
Ground next Saturday. South Sydney will commence its
battle with Newtown at 2 p.m., and after the dead have
been removed and the wounded sent to hospital, Glebe
will charge University at 3.15. South Sydney has met
Newtown twice before this season, and gone under on
both occasions, and the chances are that it will repeat the
diving process a third time, in spite of the Usual odds
against the same thing happening thrice running.
Newtown has a much sounder defence than the Sand-
pipers. When Glebe previously met University it downed
the blue-and-gold side by 13 to nine. The probabilities
are that the final will be between Glebe and Newtown,
and a prettv struggle it will be. It is said that University
is hard at work evolving some new tactics and a special
plan of play which will smite the butcher team where it
lives ; but writer believes that the solid weight and sys-
tematic play of the Glebe team will prove a solid rock
against which the rush of blue-and-gold will go to pieces.
In the Rugby League’s Competition, Eastern
Suburbs, Glebe and South Sydney are all together in the
front rank with 16 points each. North Sydney is in the
second line with 12, and Newcastle close behind with 10.
The other four clubs are in single figures only, and there-
fore out of the hunt. The tram strike affected attend-
ances considerably, land at the Agricultural Ground on
Saturdav there were only a few hundred people to watch
the brilliant Eastern Suburbs, including the great god
Messenger, romp over the sturdy Newcastle team by
34 to 17. Big as the margin was between the points, there
seemed little difference between the teams—excepting
that Messenger was on the side of Eastern Suburbs. But,
somehow, just when a score seemed inevitable Newcastle
would fade suddenly out, lose the leather, or something.
North Sydney gave" Cumberland a most unholy doing,
trampling it in the loam and dancing on it to the tune of
45 points to nil. The feature of the Northern Union game
is its ruthlessness, and it was never better demonstrated
in Sydney than at the slaying of Cumberland on Satur-
day. The overthrow of Balmain by Squth Sydney showed
the old South back machine at its best. The passing
charges were beautiful to watch, and verily, they had
their reward in a score of 16 to two. The surprise of the
day was Western Suburbs’ victory over Newtown by six
to five. W.S. followed the British tactics at Waterloo :it
played a defensive game in the first half and let the
attack exhaust itself, and then came with a series of
charges. At half-time the score was nil, and it was a
chance goal that pulled Newtown out of the ruck as far
as it got.
° * * * *
With each succeeding Saturday the footballers’
struggle to get into the “ final four ” of the Vic. League
gets fiercer. As matters stand, Carlton and Essendon
have won their way in, and St. Kilda looks probable ; but
South, Colling wood and Melbourne all stand together on
the next mark, wherefore each does its darnedest to avoid
disaster. As Melbourne has very tough engagements
ahead of it, its chance looks poor ; but the man who
would bet on South or ’Wood is more sanguine than he
has any right to be. Also ’Varsity has a “possible.”
The concussion of Essendon and ’Wood, last week,
drew a beautiful crowd to Victoria Park, and pro-
vided a joyous afternoon. The Magpies started with
their usual vim, and at quarter-time had knocked up
22 points to tlie “same old’s” 11; but after that their
kicking went all astray, and half-time saw them nine
points to the bad. A pleasihg scrap enlivened the next
quarter, but the umpire and the game proceeded as if
nothing irregular were happening, and each side put on
another three goals three behinds. The start of the last
quarter saw the Magpies at their best. Forcing the
bladder steadily along the wing, they held possession for
fully 15 minutes. A shot gave them a behind, and another
a goal, but they were still two points down. The ’Dons
collared, and strove their mightiest for the goal that
would settle matters, but the ball was reft from them
(even as the stage hero is reft from his wife on a false
accusation), passed away along the wing again, and on to
’Wood’s forwards. There the chance was mulled through
over-eagerness, and the ball went out of bounds. But
the Magpies were determined. In a whirling rush they
embezzled the ball and passed it across till the right spot
was reached, and the forward gently punted it through.
For five long minutes the’Dons hurled themselves on to
the attack, while’Wood’s barrackers held their breath
and prayed for the. bell to ring;; but the Magpies had
massed their men back, and the hardest battle put up on
Yarra side this year went to them bv four points only-60
to Essendon’s 56. On the East Melbourne mudhole
South had its back to the wall and was fighting for exist-
ence. ’Varsity was doing the attacking, and experience
has shown that the students are never beaten till
the bell rings. At quarter time “ Skinner’s Hirelings had
scored 15 points to two, and were happy. Then Varsity
settled down to business, and at half-time had totted up
46 points to South’s 24. There was no wind to account
for these irregularities, so on resuming South made up
its mind to bog in or die. But the students bogged in
also and at lemon time had added four additional points
to their advantage-59 to 33. The last quarter saw- a
violent struggle, and a noise as if a herd of lunatic
asylums had broken loose. The students were hard
pressed, though they managed to add 14 more points, but
the Red-and-White' “heavies” plugged away hard and
straight, and more than doubled their previous score by
notching 6 goals 2 behinds. But even as they tore down the
ground again after the last “ bounce ’’the bell rang,with
’Varsity still two points ahead —73 to South s 71. At the
big ground across the park, Melbourne w-as receiving
Saints and passing them a “ dirty doing.” The godly
men’s score of 8 goals 3 behinds was a fair tally for the
day and the weather, but while they were totting up
those 51 points Melbourne booted the ball through 10
times and between the behind posts 11 times. It was a
surprising encounter, and unaccountable from whichever
side you inspected it; but Melbourne is always a,n un-
accountable. team ; also St. Kilda might be a good deal
less lop-sided and irregular than it is. ’Roy put up a
good fight against Carlton, but its paltry kicking left
it 11 points dow'n at the finish —33 to 44. Richmond paid
its first visit to Geelong for 20 years, and afforded the
lamentable sea-siders a chance for a second won this
season, which chance they promptly took 53 points
to 38.
V * » * ,
The Association position is just about as in-
teresting as the League’s. ’Scray is in the finals, and,
unless ’Tow'n throws away its next three games, it must
also arrive ; but for the other two places Essendon (Ass.),
P’ran and Brunswick are battling, with but half a point
between the lot, so neither can afford to lose even one
game. Wherefore Saturday’s games were full of vim
and clash. Brunswick encountered the premiers, Town,
and emphasised the fact that it is with them a case of do
or die, and that they are going to die fighting. Encour-
aged by the yells of the brickies, they ran over the para-
lysed premiers and scored 16 to nil the first quarter, and
26 to three by half-time. Then ’Town woke up and played
in something like last season’s style, putting up 30 points
to 41 by lemon-time ; but Brunswick wasn't quite
done, and another two goals made it safe—s 3
points to ’Town’s 39. The victory so overjoyed
an elderly gentleman that his heart proved unequal to
the strain, and he incontinently passed out in the midst
of his jubilation. Essendon also has to keep on winning
or go out, so, though it had to meet the formidable
’Scray, it got its eleven ex-League stars in going order
and set a pace that ’Scrav couldn’t equal, coming out
finally with 56 points to the latter’s 47. P’ran bumped
against the victorious Ports, and knowing that defeat
meant obliteration, piled up points at a rate that flabber-
gasted the Harbor suburb men. They were left dazed
and dilapidated, with a score of 66 points to 17 to ponder
over. Brighton, which has an outside show' for the finals
should it come to a matter of averages, made sure of all
the points that were lying around loose by piling up a
nobby "total of 70 against Preston’s poor little five.
Northcote and North are understood to have collided
somewhere, to ’Cote’s advantage, but the result makes no
difference to anybody.

During tlie week both League and Ass. dis-
cussed the reports of the recent conference, and declined
to take any co-operation or district football in theirs ; so
matters will remain as they are till the public wearies of
the semi-professional ’bailer, as it assuredly will in a year
or two. The League delegates seemed to be filled with
the idea that “ League football has now reached its
highest standard,”in which case there could, of course, be
no possibility of improvement; while the Ass. men suf-
fered from a notion that they are the genuine pea, and
that the League is smoodging to them with a base idea
of capsizing them into the soup at the finish. So the
migratory player will transpire as before until, a 3 afore-
said, the public wearies of his capers.
The so-called Marathon race, the, star event at
the Olympic Games, London, was battled out on Friday
last, over the 26 miles 600 yards between Windsor Castle
and the Stadium at Shepherd’s Bush. Of the 72 com-
petitors entered, representing 17 countries, some 55 faced
the barrier, so to speak, and then bolted for their lives
towards the Big Smoke—theoretically carrying w'ith them
the first news of the Persian defeat. The result was an
unexpected w'in for P. Durando, a Dago athlete,, who-
staggered home after receiving assistance—w'hieh is for-
bidden—in the last few yards of the race. He was conse-
quently disqualified, and J. J. Hayes, a’Murkan rep., vvas
awarded the contest. C. Hefferon, the South African
champion, was next, followed by another ’Murkan named
Foreshaw. Ivanberg (Sweden), who ran second to Bill
Sherring at Athens in 1906, finished eighth.
Canadians Wood, Simpson and Law-son filled fifth,
sixth and seventh places. They were under the
care of the man who won at Athens two years ago.
Durando, the disqualified, covered the journey in 2hr.
54min. 46sec.'; whilst Hayes was 32sec. slower. Com-
pared with Bill Sherring’s 2hr. 51min. at Athens, the go
is no great shakes, because the Athenian. race was ovet
bad roads on a chain of hills. Reference is made in the
cable report to the hot sun, which no doubt affected the
British, for their best effort was Clarke’s 13th. At Athens,
the day was also hot and trying, so that the comparison is
distinctly in favor of Sherring’s run.
The Australian representatives— George Blake,
"Vic Aitken and Jim Lynch—provided very poor dis-
plays. An accident evidently stopped Blake, and it takes
more than a gentle rap to stop that hardy ped. In a letter
received in Melbourne this week Lynch was reported
fat as a whale, with no earthly chance. Vic Aitken,
the Coburg (Melbourne) harrier, went under at 21 miles
with the tired feeling, after attaining fourth position. The
tired feeling struck Aitken in exactly the same spot as in
his trial run before leaving Melbourne. The experience
gained in the race and additional years should make
Aitken a tough proposition for the future. Meanwhile,
he requires building up, as he hasn’t got too much
stamina. Owing to limited funds, Blake and Aitken
return immediately after the race. Meanwhile, their
failure is principally a topic amongst those who never
contributed a stiver to their going, the trip having been
engineered by a handful of amateur enthusiasts. The
Victorians report that they received scant courtesy at the
hands of Taverner and the Bent picnic party
S.A. cricket is to lose Claude Jennings, who is
going to travel for the big wool-firm of Dalgety and Co.,
and will retire from first-class play. Jennings’ best
seasons were his first and last. In December, 1903, he
was 12th man for the Sydney Test match, and Warner,
when leaving Adelaide the next March, named him as safe
for England in 1905 ; but after that he never did much
till last Christmas, when he made 56 and 52 against
N.S.W., 52 against Victoria, and 79 against A. O. Jones’s
team. In club cricket he had a season’s average over 70
three times: one year it touched 100. He kept wicket
for S.A. several times, and was thought to have an off-
chance of getting into the next team for England.
The English batting averages in the middle of
June were headed bv Jessop, Crawford, Warner, Hirst,
Young and Tyldesley, The boss bowlers were Haigh (69
wickets for under eight runs apiece), Wass, Hirst and
Relf.

The Goulburn to Sydney cycle road-race, pro-
moted by the big Dunlop Rubber Co., is to eventuate
on Sept. 19, under the rules and handicapping of N.S.W.
League of Wheelmen. The distance is about 131 miles,
and the prize list totals £l5O in cash and kind. There
are five regular prizes, commencing with a £3O cheque
and a £5 medal, donated by the Dunlop Co.; and nine
special prizes for fastest time in various divisions. All
competitors who cover the distance in not more than 10
hours will receive bronze and enamel medals. Nomina-
tions close Monday, 24th August, at 5 p.m. Acceptances
close on Wednesday, 9th Sept. No outside pacing or
coaching is permitted, and the same machine must be
ridden from start to finish. There are four feeding
stations on the run, and as the Dunlop 00. will look after
the prog, riders can rely upon it being up to the com-
pany’s usual high standard.

The Yankees have cabled accepting November
26 as the date of the tennis tournament for the Davis
Cup. The preliminary match between the U.S.A. and
England will be played at week earlier.
If the plucking of the punter pigeon at Sydney
suburban courses continues at the present rate, that un-
fortunate bird will soon have not a feather left to fly with.
The in-and-out running of the nags and the strange
doings of owners and trainers give him absolutely no
chance. At Canterbury Park the plucking eased off
somewhat, and the fond belief that the luck had changed
lured a big and eager crowd of pigeons to Rosehill on
Saturday. Not a single favorite got a look in, and three
absolute outsiders fairly romped home. One of these,
Dan O’Brien’s two-year-old Ariki, by imported Grafton
from Cello, and brother of Sivori, gathered the Flying
Handicap in a manner that suggested future possi-
bilities. Twenties were freely offered against
him, and were taken by nobody. The Tasmanian
jumper Holdsberg was first choice for the Hurdles, but
never looked like a winner, Atlantean getting home by
four lengths.' H.C. (what a name !), who failed badly in
the Novice Handicap at A.J.C. Birthday meeting, had a
confident stable following, and landed the money from a
crowd of others without any apparent effort. Nothing
that Hela had done prepared spectators for the manner
in which she won the Nursery Handicap from 18
opponents ; the few in the know picked up money at 12
and 14 to one. The way that well-known good one,
Menteith, figured in the betting was, like the Chinaman’s
card tricks, peculiar. He was backed from sixes down
to evens. Moses suddenly refused to lay him. Then
twos, threes and fours were suddenly bellowed against
him, till finally Moses wagered anything that he couldn’t
win. And he didn’t, by a long way. But he might-
later on.

Someone has gone into the thing and discovered
that the 11 horse and pony clubs operating within the
Sydney metropolitan area, and those at Warwick Farm
and Hawkesbury, held 125 meetings during the season
which closes this week, and disbursed £92,858 10s. in prize
money. What the public disbursed is known only to the
bookmaker and bis father, the Devil.

South Australian J. C. continues to improve
financially. Four meetings held during past year showed
a profit of £3044, as against £l6OO twelve months before.

M.L. San Fran mare Tangimoana is a rare good
one. At Te Mahanga yearling sales she cost 60gs., and
won as a two-year-old, but in three starts did nothing
next season. Present year, however, has brought con-
siderable grist. Seven firsts, five seconds, and three
thirds yielded £lBBO, which, added to the previous win,,
makes £2OlO. Tangimoana’s sire appropriated 1901
Sydney Cup, among other things.
At the last Tattersall’s race-meeting in Ade-
laide, the totaiisator gave itself bold advertisement. It
began the day by paying £Bl 2s. (more than the stake it-
self was worth) on the winner of the first race ; this would
have been well over £lOO not so long ago, but now one-
fourth of the money in the machine goes to backers of
the second horse. Accordingly, in the next race, there
was a £23 dividend on the second steed, besides a useful
£ll 15s. on the winning moke. But perhaps the most
significant working of the new system showed in the last
race, when a real good thing in Topedi finished a bad
second, and yet her hundreds of backers got back 225. for
each lost pound. , * *
An unexpected burst of brilliancy in the V. A.
Billiard Tournament caused the favorite, A. H. Tricks, to
lose one of his games last week. In his heat with Haley
he had already dropped considerably into the rear,
through careless play, when Haley ran up a faultless 125.
Presently Tricks bucked up and scored breaks of 85 and
72, but the leader, playing steadily and well, won by more
than 100 points. This was the best game ever played thus
far in a Victorian amateur championship tournament,
and it had an improving effect on the “form ” all round—
which needed a tome badly.
The American Fleet souvenir number of Thf.

“Frank C.”: Bill Lang, Richmond (Vic.),
footballer and “ resident heavy-weight champion of Aus-
tralia,” as he styles himself, didn’t send his stock up t by
his fight against Jim Griffin, of Maoriland. The Vic-
torian scaled 13st. 81b., Griffin but list. 81b. ; yet the
latter scored all the points and made the pace very fast.
Lang seemed to be waiting and watching solely for a
knock-out with his favorite right cross, but while he ;was
waiting Griffin was scoring heavily on face and body, and
had there been more beef behind the muscle Lang would
have gone out. On Monday night’s showing Lang’s
chance against Burns, Squires or Johnson is less than
Buckley’s. He has the fist and the head of a fighter, but
apparently that head is empty ; he simply didn’t seem to
know what to do with Griffin. A 2500 house, worth about
£3OO, saw the scrap.

A sidelight is thrown on English (Soccer) foot-
ball bv the publication of the Sunderland club’s balance-
sheet for the past season. (Being a limited-liability
company, it has to publish.) Its income was £12,482,
and on that it made a loss of £715. The directors explain
that the team played so badly that towards the end of the
season the club’ looked like being dropped from the first
division of the League into the second; so they had to
rush, into the market and buy a fresh lot of players at
famine prices. The drop was avoided, and Sunderland
will continue to meet all the best clubs in the country,
and get big gates ; therefore the money is regarded as
well spent.
THE .PEACE OF KATOOMBA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A meeting ot 200 motorists in Sydney decided to avoid
Katoomba in their travels, on account of the recent
prosecutions and convictions for furious driving through
the municipality. —Daily Paper.
Now the lone cow in safety may recline
Upon her elbow on the road that leads
To sweet Katoomba, where the air’s like wine
And nothing mangled on the highway bleeds.
The proud, perambulating rooster, too,
May stroll along and never o’er his tail
Look backward where the Oar of Horror (Phew !)
Flies, smokes and hoots, and smells intensely stale.
Old country dames, whose youth has been renewed
Flying before the wheels that skid and splash,
Will once again upon the roads intrude
And never more for home and country dash.
Never again will that place stand aghast
Wond’ring what evil thing it was that ran
Bearing to Heaven—or to Hades—fast
Some frantic devil in an old tin can.
Katoomba rests ! The unpolluted wind
Blows as it did before the smell of grease
Eaged through the land. Katoomba doesn’t mind
But laughs and revels in its loathly peace.

There isn’t much that Admiral Rozhjest-
vensky hasn’t had laid to his charge, and the very
latest accusation to be levelled at him is that of
being dead. The report, however, proved to be
grossly exaggerated. People of no importance
throughout the world made fun of the Admiral
and the fleet that fell a victim to Togo’s waiting
tactics at Tsushima. Nevertheless, experts held
that in taking that large and motley herd of
vessels from the Baltic to Japan without accident
Admiral Rozhjestvensky performed a very credit-
able feat. Nothing but admiration is due to the
man who, in the poorest of health and under the
most trying conditions, carried the fortunes of
Russia in his hands for half a year, and finally
staked all on a gallant, if almost hopeless, dash
for victory. With a large proportion of his crews
mere landsmen who had never seen service on the
watbr before, this man, who has been the butt of
the world’s ridicule, took a mighty fleet more than
half way round the globe on a self-contained
voyage. Then, with mutiny rampant, his ships
foul with weeds and short of coal and provisions,
he steamed bravely into the Monkey’s trap and
‘made a gallant fight. Could Togo have done
better had the positions been reversed ?

“ Hamer ” : The actor at times works as many hours as
anybody. A co. recently appearing in Sydney worked
fourteen hours a day for two weeks —two rehearsals of a
new piece which was being hurriedly prepared, and the
regular night performance. This was apart from the
“ study,” which Thespians are supposed to give to.their
parts, and often don’t. An actor-manager, much beloved
of Australian audiences, had a habit, when the playing of
any scene did not suit his artistic tastes, of calling a re-
hearsal after the performance. The habit was a pretty
constant one, and those of the company who lived in
suburban neighborhoods frequently got home with diffi-
culty in the grey hours of morning. Because of this some
people who knew them, but didn’t know their troubles,
used to think them very gay dogs. Instead, they were
only very tired ones.
“S.T.S.” : I am sufficiently un-Scotch to be worried by
a Scotticism that is rampant all through “ Peter Pan”—
the use of “ is to,” as a plain future tense, in place of “ is
going to.” In English, to say that anyone “is to ”do a
thing implies compulsion, or at any rate a settled arrange-
ment, a cut-and-dried plan. How does J.M.B. use the
expression ? “ Tinker is to build me a house in the tree-
tops ” ; “ Perhaps she is to sing to us ’’; “I am to die like
an English gentleman. What are you to do? ” The word
“ going ”is needed in every case. Certainly no English-
man talks like that, and it has never been suggested that
“Peter” is a Scotch play. Doesn’t Barrie know any
better?
“Haresfoot”: “Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch”
makes me think of Charlotte Bronte, who drew Jane Eyre
like herself, small and plain, with greenish eyes. Char-
lotte and her father, Rev. Patrick Bronte, went to see
“ Jane Eyre ” acted at a small town near Haworth. The
Rochester of the piece was "one Lysander Thompson.
Charlotte was delighted with the performance, especially
because of the plain little heroine, who won so much
applause. “Oh ! ” she exclaimed, “ the pretty ones are
doomed.” Alas! The fact is the bread-and-butter
misses rule the stage, determine what pieces shall be
acted, and call for the round of Monsieur Beaucaires and
Robin Hoods. All cuddly, hugger-muggery and slobbery.
Now comes “ Mrs. Wiggs.” The play, to besure, has two
pretty girls, but Mrs. W. waves them right into the back-
ground. Come forward, Miss Hazy, Mrs. Eichhorn, and
Mrs. Schwartz. Glory to the Uglies !
“J.A.C.”: New York Dramatic Mirror (18/4/’OS) con-
tained the following
“ The 285th anniversary of the birth of William Shaks-
peare will be fittingly observed in the Episcopal Church
of the Ascension, Kent-street, Brooklyn, of which the
Rev. Walter E. Bentley is rector, on Tuesday, April 23, at
8 p.m. Pull Episcopal service, with special music,” etc.
Either the Mirror or the Rev. Bentley is somewhat
at sea in the matter of chronology, for Shaltspeare
was born in 1564. In another column of the same paper
appears this advt. :
“ SERIOUS-minded actors of good character who would
like to study for the Episcopal Ministry are invited to
address Rev. Walter E. Bentley, Mirror office.”
Now is this our own well-remembered Macßichelieu or
that other Bentley who used to be so often mixed up
with him?
An old member of an Australian theatrical orchestra
had a golden wedding recently, and the management was
good enough to give him a holiday. It gave him a
present, too—a free ticket for that night’s performance.
“Sr.”: Here’s my complaint. I have been to 83
“ parties ” of the type described as “ Mrs. Brown asked a
few friends to celebrate her son’s eleventh birthday,” and
I approximately estimate that out of those 83 tortures,
on 83 different occasions, “a girl who won the A.N.A.
competition at Camberwell or somewhere ” has clawed
with her voice a yell entitled “I’m returning from an
exile farrrrr Heway.” The song, as shrieked,
enters the catalogue of tragic melodrama. The first
act begins by the husky one remarking that
“ she’s returning yes returning yes returning from an
exile farrrr away away, yes returning yes returning.”
Then out of the maze of throat wrestling I always hear
the same old other part of the ticket about the return.
In the final act, the returning one passionately trolls
“ Ahh yes ! Ahh yes ! from an hexile. Ahhh yes. Farrr
Away.” Another ditty, upon which I would fain pass
sentence of death, is that everlasting duet, “ Love’s Life
Dream is O’er,” especially the stanza that describes “ my
heart throbbing in my breast.” I respectfully urge that
the principal organ of the body should beat linder the
fifth and sixth left ribs and nowhere else. Songs ought
to be medically examined before publication, or else the
fellow who writes the song should have an illustrated
work on anatomy beside him while he pens his lines
about “ My heart beating fiercely in my boots ” or “ The
lung - bowed down.”
The great emotional actress swam into the managerial
box, garnitured superbly. She was attended by two
tame animals. Her dress was expensive, but not ex-
cessive ; her furs were dreams ; her face might have been
painted by Michael Angelo. She swept the great house
with a frigid glance. “ Ponto,” she said to the bigger
dog, “ they are unresponsive. They do not recognise me
—and only yesterday ” Ponto was contemptuous.
“Tchah!” he said. “You are here to-day, and vaguer
than a name to-morrow. Bourgeois indifference! It’s
obscene. It’s filthy, but—it’s bourgeois. It’s a greater
supersession than their ignorance. Why prostitute your
eminence to these swine? It is paltry !S! ” “Shut
up ! ” she said, moving into the radius of general observ-
ation. Still they were unresponsive, placidly eating pea-
nuts and chocolate creams. There was no applause. The
curtain went up ; the house darkened ; her bijouterie
gleamed like a drunk’s heaven. The end came. “ What
do you think of it?” whispered Rover, the other tame
animal. “Rotten!” she said, bitterly. Followed the
second act, full of feeling, plaints, prayers, tears. The
great emotional actress wept into her hanky. Almost
she moaned. “Behold! the great actress weeps!” said
the audience, and banged its paws sympathetically.
“What do you think of it?” said Ponto. “How
delightful ! ” she murmured, as one in a trance, and
Ponto and Rover, to whom she paid no more heed, went
out and gnashed their tails.
“ Melb.” : Apropos the King’s Theatre, here are the
dates of theatre openings in Melbourne: 1845, the
Queen’s, with “The Bear-Hunters” and “Black-Eyed
Susan,” Nesbitt as leading actor and manager ; 1855, the
Royal, with “ The School for Scandal” and “ The Actress
of All Work ” ; same year, the Olympic, with Wizard
Jacobs ; same year, Astley’s, afterwards the Princess;
1858, Prince of Wales’, opposite Melbourne Hospital;
1860, Pavilion, Cremorne ; 1863, Haymarket; 1872, Opera
House and the new Royal ; 1875, Bijou; 1885, new
Princess’s, and Alexandra (now Her Majesty’s).
THE ADMIRABLE VILLAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The hero’s coat is of faultless cut,
He is gallant and debonair,
He walks the stage with a regal strut,
There is nothing he will not dare.
The limelight’s his and the girl likewise,
And the villain’s his deadly foe ;
Take him all in all
At the curtain fall
He is good—as such heroes go.
The heroine is a lovely maid,
She has bushels of golden hair ;
In muslin white is she arrayed,
And the villain she cannot bear.
She says the things to the plotting wretch
That make plotting wretches wilt.
(When she kissed and clung
She’d a sweeter tongue—
But that’s how such girls are built.)
The villain comes to a bad, had end
When the evening’s nearly o’er.
At curtain-fall for the cops they send
To end his career of gore.
And as he stands ’midst the jeering crowd
With his countenance ashen grey,
Then, of all the rest,
Well, I like him best
(In a villainous kind of way).

The energetic little league which was
formed in Sydney, some months ago, to push for-
ward the movement for the Unification of Aus-
tralia and its subsequent subdivision into new
States on more scientific lines, has presented its
accounts for audit. It sent out collecting lists to
get the funds necessary for the shoving process,
and received about £45, of which it still has about
one-fourth in hand. Thanks to the energy and
unpaid personal efforts of Mr. J. B. Steel and his
enthusiastic co-officers, a vast amount of work has
been done for the money, and it is hardly necessary
to add that the accounts are correct. More work
has still to be done and more money is still needed ;
so the lists will go on circulating.
Sydney Stab, which recently printed a
wild yarn about how it was cheered by the men at
Waverley tram depot, tried last Tuesday to play
the part of strike breaker on the lines that the
Age adopted in the Victorian Railway struggle.
The only difference was that the Age was a
straight out and acknowledged enemy, while the
Star posed as a friend, and tried to stab the men
from behind. It came out with a statement that
the strike would be probably declared off at mid-
day, and that the railway men had, by an over-
whelming majority, decided not to strike. In the
same issue, under the title ‘‘The Pity of It,” it
shed crocodile tears over the wav the men had been
misled, and urged them to get back and secure
their billets while they were available, on the
each-for-himself principle. Yet the Star could
easily have ascertained that there was no word of
the strike being declared off, and that the ballot
of the railway men was not over, but ip' progress,
when the lying edition went to press. The Age
helped to bring about the collapse of the Vic-
torian railway strike by printing a country
edition which stated that the city men were
swarming back to work, leaving the country and
Geelong men to their fate. In its city edition it
stated that the country and Geelong men were
making terms and leaving the city men to their
fate. And between the two stampedes that fol-
lowed the strike collapsed. Men who would de-
scend to that sort of treachery would murder dogs,
and men who would murder dogs are not human.
The Panama Canal Recobi> points out in
one of its February issues how “ they are making
the dirt fly on the isthmus.” Operations are
being conducted simultaneously on four divisions
—the Culebra. the Chagres, the Colon and La
Boca. An average of a million cubic yards of
material is excavated from each cut per month.
Work on bridges and culverts is proceeding, and
a tunnel has been started. Two post offices, six
store houses, one market, one lodge hall and
church, one office building, and a number of
houses have been built in the last six months.
And all this, which is part of the biggest en-
gineering work of the century, is being carried out
by day labor and under Government supervision.
The eight-hour system is in vogue, and the climate
in which white workers are putting up this con-
structional record is no more to be compared in
point of salubrity with the worst that N. Aus-
tralia (the region where Fat says none but
black indent labor can survive) provides than is

lias acquired the old-established business of J. W. Glen-
field and Co., Ltd., 315 Kent-street, Sydney, arid intends to
enlarge things by carrying stocks of a much more
comprehensive nature, and so assuring prompt delivery to
Australian customers. Bell’s Asbestos Co., of England,
is the largest and oldest-established asbestos manufactur-
ing company in the world, leaving out of the question the
one that ran at Argos two thousand years ago. Mr. J. W.
Glenfield will manage the new concern as he did the old
business of Glenfield and Co., and with the increased
facilities at his disposal will give customers better service
than ever. The co.’s leading lines are all the wide range
of asbestos sundries, Farnley iron, well known for its
fibrous and ductile qualities, Bell’s mechanical rubber
goods, machine belting, packed main and angle cocks,
faced valves, lubricants, engine-room sundries, tools,
fittings, and ten thousand and one other things that the
old-established Bell firm is famous for.*
The graduated land-tax idea is going the
road of all other great reforms. It was fifst
laughed at with a shriek of mirth ; second, it Was
argued against as impracticable; third, it was
denounced as unreasonable; fourth, it was howled
at as revolutionary; fifth, as it came nearer and
the big land-grabber became really alarmed, it
was made the subject of a sky-towering shriek as
being theft, confiscation, robbery and unscrip-
tural conduct. And now (sixth) Tories like Bent
of Victoria and Jacky Evans of Tasmania put
it, in a tentative sort of way, on their programmes.
Presently (seventh) the Australian Parliament
will take the matter out of State hands and make
it law. And finally (eighth) the great majority of
the Tories will declare that they were never op->
posed to the blessed thing at all.
“ Stony ” writes at some length :
The new Prahran (Vic.) garbage-destructor, a brick
giant which rears its smoky head within a mammoth
stone’s-throw of the Toorak border, is responsible for
some remarkable color-effects at night. There are other
effects, also, it is alleged. When the works are in full
blast a great column of smoke streams across the sky, and
carries with it a reflection of whatever may be the prevail-
ing- sky-color. Usually, this is a pale brown, from the
Chapel-street electrics ; but the crimson sunset and the
white moonlight also take a hand on occasion, and glorify
the heavens above P’ran. Upon the question as to
whether the smoke of the destructor is loud or noiseless ih
odor, P’ran opinion seems to be divided. One frenzied resi-
dent wrote to the papers to say that he had been torn from
his slumbers by a screaming smell at 3 o’clock in the morn-
ing, and he blamed the dirt-killer. The authorities, who
ought to know, declared that on the particular night
mentioned all burning had ceased at 11 o’clock, and that
the works only began to whirl once more at 9 o’clock the
next day. One recent night I vvoke at 1 o’clock, and
went to watch the destructor. A couple of miles of
billowing, pale-yellow smoke stretched overhead from
P’ran to the uttermost parts of Toorak. There wasn’t
the faintest murmur of a smell. A few nights later a
frantic odor clamored in the room, and I arose, cursing.
The destructor gave forth a feeble pipeful of smoke that
couldn’t have held enough odor to arouse a cat. It would
seem as though P’ran’s very sanitary and necessary de-
tractor, while failing to receive appreciation for-its
scenic effects, is being blamed for the sins and smells and
horrors of the decaying ruins which flourish over by the
Saltwater Kiver, where the gore from the martyred cow
runs down the slopes towards the river and.dies upon its.
way. The P’ran propputy-owner, too, is a person liable to
be influenced by a simple stench where the need for taking
precautions against an outbreak of typhoid would make
him complain of “ unnecessary expense.”

From the shop where they sell “de oyst’ ” :
“Vile descendant of Ulysses !” roared the little man
with the frayed whiskers, rising unsteadily from his seat
in the oyster-repository. “ Produce the—hie —bivalves,
or by—hie—Olympus ”
“ One large plate 1 One small plate ! Two kuppa d’
kof’, oystaire cockatel!! ” enthusiastically howled the
Levantine addressed. Then, pityingly, “ Yalessis, yes ?
What 1 You know Yalessis? ”
“ Why, you poor heathen,” apoplectically shouted the
classic one, “ are you so shunk depsh of ignoransh not to
recognise allusion your illushtrious anceshtor ? Ulysses
—hie 1 From Ithaca —hie ! ”
“ Large bottle stout! ” replied the Dago, pityingly.
“ You all wrong. Yalessis, he from Kreetee.”
“What, fellow?” vociferated the little man, in the
throes of pedantic convulsions. “From Crete? What in
.Sheol! I tell you your illushtrious anceshter Ulysses
—hie—from Ithaca— hie ! Damn yer—hie.”
“Buya d’krayfish !” scornfully retorted the Hellene.
And, with contempt unrecordable, “ Yalessis from
Kreetee. He say so.”
Whiskers leaned murderously over the capsicum flask,
and gasped the query in a restrained, choking voice:
“ What Ulysses ? —HIC !! ”
“ Yalessis —Yalessis from Kreetee,” cried the heathen,
much impressed by the sense of impending storm, and
backing prudently. “He keepa der oyst’ joint Swanst’-
street.”
And then the small, whiskered man became so baresark
that it took the combined efforts of Constantine, Spiro,
George, Demetrius and Herakles to hurl him from the
akropolis to the pave.
Perth (W.A.) had its milk supply-
examined the other day, and now Perth feels bad.
In one dairy the Board of Health’s tuberculin
test on 29 cows showed that 20 were affected. In
another, five out of eight were ordered to be de-
stroyed, while in a third 12 of 18 were unfit to
supply milk for human consumption. In four
dairies inspected, no less than 42 cows were found
to be tuberculous. Perth awaits further tests
with its hair on end, and citizens, hitherto of con-
firmedly Anti-Soshite views, are taking to discuss-
ing openly the advantages of a municipal milk
supply.
“ Boh ” tells about an amateur show :
Weird are the ways of the up-eountry official. A lady
visitor had arranged a theatrical entertainment for a
charity. The local rate-collector, dog-taxer, and dead-
horse remover had, in his spare time, rigged up a stage in
the local Social Hall. Also he had painted scenery. It
was nobody’s business to point out to the amateur scenic
artist that the whole thing was hideous. When people
wanted the use of the Punch and Judy “ fitup,” they had
to take walking exercise on their hands and knees and
ask the loan of the unspeakable erection. The scenery
was not to be hired. Then the rehearsals commenced,
and the artist caretaker got in his deadly work. Just as
the lover was going through his best scene, a wild crash
would be heard at the- end of the hall Where the “scene
painter” kept his tools. “Do you love me, dear?” the
actor would ask, while the pianist played the “Spring
Song” like the cat walking oft the piano in the dark ;
and the lady would brace herself up to say “With
all my heart,” but she would only' get as far as, “With ”
... when something would whoop up in the hall, and
the caretaker would appear out of the obscurity dragging
old planks. And as sure as the unfortunate players were
getting on a bit and things threatened to go smoothly,
the demon, caretaker would arrive on the scene, and pro-
ceed to take down the scenery. One moment the lover
would be seated on a mossy bank thinking out loud about
his best girl; then a dirty white sleeve would whisk away
the background, and he would finish the speech with a
battered old coffee urn and half a cask of bran for
“ props.” On other nights the hall would be swept out,
and clouds of dust would choke the leading lady. And in
spite of it all the show came off and was not a failure,
and the caretaker and his family sat in the front row—in
seats they never paid for. And meeting the worker for
charity in the township next day, the monstrous dragger
of planks advanced with outstretched hand. But the
lady was too much occupied looking for the Southern
Cross at three in the afternoon—and so no more !

The Inky Way.
There are two men in the Adelaide Advertiser office
who were employed there when the first paper was pub-
lished on July 12, 1858. They are Harry (or “ Hoppy ”)
Edwards, in the commercial department; and Archie
Mather, in the machine room. The latter drawls a pension,
but still looks in to show the young fellows how to do it.
*
The parable—and plaint—of “ Waif ” :
“ I am a working tripe-dresser, a poor but (though I
say it) a passing proficient practitioner in that humble field
of toil. I hire out my services to whomsoever will pay
for them, and I have the honor to work for several
wealthy masters, not only near at hand, but also in far
parts. But the pay of a tripe-dresser, though you would
not, of course, know it, is small. So, as a man must live,
even a tripe-dresser, I am constrained to keep an in-
significant little tripery of my own. I employ no labor,
for even the boy who used to clean the benches wanted
wages, so I clean them (sometimes) myself.
“Now, there was lately established an Institute of
Tripe-Dressers, for the benefit, as I thought, of poor
workers like myself ; for the members must all be working
tripe-dressers, and lam that, God knows. But they will
not admit me, because, forsooth, I am a master
tripe-dresser ! Perhaps I should feel that this raises me
to a place apart and above my fellow-workers ; but ! am
not proud, and I do not take it so. I even look at the
company from which I am debarred, and still vain glory
does not assail me.
“Thereis one whom lam honored to call my friend,

A Ballarat (Vic.) newspaper has hired a superintendent of
police to do its football notes. Here are some, of the re-
sults :—“ In the match was seen in vivid form the indonti-
table and unconquerable courage that quails not even
amidst the dank and gloom of fated despair ” ; “great
and important issues were at stake”; “the ball, as
though endowed with life, flew in arch-like flights, with
the velocity of an eagle in earnest and deadly pursuit of
an elusive prey” ; “ players passing and re-passing each
other with whirlwind speed”; “struggling scene of
alternate hope and fear” ; “startling effort and lightning
football ” ; “followers of each team vibrating with enthu-
siasm occasioned by' the heroic essays”; “ vim and fire
stored only in the units of the Anglo-Saxon race”;
“players swelling with pride at their own paralysing
outbursts ”; “ smashed through the formidable ranks ...
like a tornado ” ; “men with the gust of a cyclone tore
through ” ; “ espying the halo of victory encircling their
brows ”; “ encounter of Titans dotted with deeds of
shining splendor,” etc.

“ Scribe ” : “ The Swimmer ” (B. Xl/6/’OS) is in the surf
when he says that “ competent reporters in Africa get £3
a week, and sub-editors from £l6 to £2O a month.” I
have been reporting recently'in Cape Town, Bloemfontein
and Johannesburg, and never drew less than £2O per
month. Pay is lowest in Cape Town. In Bloemfontein
and Johannesburg the screw to start with is £25 per
month for a general reporter and £3O to £35 for others.
But, even at the last rate, the average sane man just stays
long enough to figure out a comparison between his
annual income and his y'early' expense account, and
then, if he can, flits hastily'. S’Africa is, for its unpleasant-
ness, one of the most expensive places on earth just now'.
“0.P.Q.”: The way's of some Victorian country
newspapers are hard to follow. On a recent holi-
day' I dropped into the office of a small daily to
See a press pal of my earlier days. He was just
moving off to the police court, after fixing up some
“copy” for the day hands. I saw him several times
in the, next 24 hours, and got a grip of .his routine.
He slogged out a column and a half of stuff relating to
neighbors’ squabbles, the midnight drunk, sheep-stealing,
and so on. Then he hurried back to the office to sub-edit
“ our own correspondent,” who had sent along some slabs
of dreary drivel about cattle that passed in the night,
and other interesting topics. Next he sped like Deer-
foot down to the local agricultural society’s meeting,
u'hicli yielded a column of bullock thrill. Two hours
tramping on his “ rounds ” followed, and in the evening
the weary press-slave turned out a couple of columns
relating to the local borough council’s doings re the drain.
If there was a pause, he would write up a “rounds”
par. Beaching the office at 10 o’clock at night, after he
had picked up two or three other meetings, he found
a pile of proofs waiting for him. I looked in at one
o’clock in the morning and said, “ Well, are you coming
home?” “ No,” he replied ; “there’s a good bit to set,
and I’ve got to give the comps a lift.*’ He lifted type
for an hour, and at 3 a.m. we passed out together. I
would sa.y hard, unkind things, but the proprietor is a
“good” man —a pillar of the church —and it wouldn’t be
right.
NOT APPRECIATED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are . three great papers in the world—the London
iimes, the New York Herald, and the Sydney Morning
Herald, said Mr. Wright in his lecture on London
before the Technical College students on Saturday even-
ln/j: e statement was greeted with applause, mingled
with a little incredulity. Australians did not appreciate
their own, went on the lecturer. The Sydney Morning
herald was more appreciated outside than inside of
Australia.—S. M. Herald (U/7/’08).
When you run a morning paper and you advocate Free-
trade,
And you make it very hot
For the local patriot—
" hen in rags that are imported you are carefully arrayed.
When you say Protection’s rot—
Very melancholy rot—
When you prove by shouts and figures that it really is a
fraud
To encourage local industry, the German doth applaud
And the oilj- London sweater shrieks his praises from
Abroad ;
They appreciate Abroad.
Very loudly do they laud
All the efforts that you make
For their foreign, greasy sake.
Oh, you’re really very popular Abroad !
When you run a morning paper—well, a paper of a sort;
When you’re very much afraid
Of the lords of rags and trade,
When you live on their advertisements, tell people to
import—
For,,remember ! you’ve been made
By the earls of lace and braid—
Oh ! the country doesn’t matter, and the future’s all a
blank,
You go on defying logic—pour your coppers in the bank,
By just booming up the products of the German and the
Yank,
Your worshippers outside,
Who regard you with much pride,
Will acclaim your eloquence,
And your stunning common-sense,
It’s the sort of common-sense they like outside.
When you run a daily paper that is cherished oversea
You must blow a little blast
On the office trumpet vast.
Never hide your foreign halo with the fan of modesty—
That as lunacy is classed,
And the world would stand aghast.
Yet it doesn’t interest us whether you are puffed with
pride,
Or bewailing your shortcomings and the shocking wav
you’ve lied ;
But Australia would delight to see you take the print
outside—
If you’ll take the thing outside
Where your foreign friends abide,
If you’ll seek your proper sphere,
Well, we’ll try to spare you here,
We’ll not stop you if you want to go outside! '

REGARDING CHAMBERLAIN’S COUGH REMEDY.
CHAMBERLAIN’S
COUGH REMEDY.
WHY IT IS GOOD.
A good Gough Remedy is one that can be
depended upon to Cure Coughs.
Not one that cures some particular cough, but
cures coughs in general.
It must be a Cough Remedy that can be relied
upon to cure all the different coughs that are so
prevalent in Australia. While the causes of all
coughs are primarily the same, yet the condition
of the patient is what makes the difference in the
nature of the cough itself. Coughs of healthy
persons are easier to cure than the coughs of
invalids. The powerful convulsive cough of a
large man is harder to cure than the cough of a
baby. If you get a remedy that will cure, a large
man’s cough, and yet not be too powerful for the
baby, you have a good cough remedy.
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is just this kind
of remedy. It is good for any member of the
family. It cures coughs of all kinds. It is the
product of much thought and study to produce an
ideal cough cure. It is composed of things which
cure easily and soothingly without harming the
most delicate tissues of the throat. It acts as
easily and safely on the young as on the old.
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is the ideal remedy
for coughs.
His Experience.
E. E. Hill, Bridgetown, W.A., writes: “From
personal experience I can testify to the efficacy of
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy. Last winter I
was troubled with a very bad cough, and tried
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy, which quickly
cured me. Now I keep a bottle on hand, and
take a dose at the first symptom of a cold, and
have never since had a cold or cough.”
She Don’t Worry.
Mrs. C. NEWSON, 111 Creek Street, Bendigo:
“Have used Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy for
many years in my family, and, since I am the
mother of eleven children, think I am entitled to
pass an opinion. All the children have at times
had coughs, colds, and a peculiar hacking cough,
which seems to run in the family. In every in-
stance we have used Chamberlain’s Cough
Remedy with splendid results. It promptly .re-
lieves and cures. We don’t worry over these
attacks so long as Chamberlain’s Cough remedy is
in the house. I always tell my neighbors to keep
it, and several do so. ”
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy may not be
needed to-day, but what about to-morrow? Colds
oome into every home, so be prepared. —-
CHAMBERLAIN’S
COUGH REMEDY.
WHY SAFE AND SURE.
In buying a cough medicine for children never
be afraid to buy Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy.
There is no danger from it, and relief is always
sure to follow. It is intended especially for
coughs, colds, croup, and whooping cough, and is
the best medicine in the world foe these diseases.
It is not only a certain cure for croup, but when
given as soon as the croupy cough appears, will
prevent the attack. Whooping cough is not dan-
gerous when this remedy is given as directed. It
contains no opium or other harmful drugs, and
may be given as confidently to a baby as to an
adult.
“ Best for Children.”
f. '
This is the opinion of Mr. THOMAS SNED-
DON, Family Grocer, Mornington, Dunedin,
N.Z., regarding Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy.
“My little grandchild was very bad with croup,
and we had tried nearly everything we ever heard
of, but with no results. We secured a bottle of
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy, and gave it to h'im
according to directions. It only took a couple of
doses to cause all the phlegm to come away, and
soon he was out of danger. I really think,” he
adds, “that Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is the
best remedy sold for children.”
Was Completely Cured.
Mr. W. MARSHALL, Inspector Vermin
Destruction Act, Coleraine, yic., says:—“We
always keep Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy in the
house, and would not be without it. I consider it
the best of all medicines, for it gives instant
relief, whether the patient is one of the children
or myself. When I first tried Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy I was driving through the Caster-
ton district, and had caught a severe cold. I
bought a couple of bottles from Messrs. H. and G.
Harris, of Casterton, and kept a bottle in my
pocket, taking a dose about every three hours, and
before they were used was completely cured. I
used to suffer from bronchitis, but by taking
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy at the first symp-
tom always ward off an attack. I have given
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy a sound and sub-
stantial trial, and have no hesitation in saying it is
the best of all cough medicines, and can highly
recommend it to anyone with a family.”
Every Bottle Guaranteed.
If you fail to get beneficial results after
two-thirds of a bottle of
CHAMBERLAIN’S
COUGH REMEDY
according to directions, return it to your dealer
and get your money back. It is well known for
its prompt cures of coughs, colds, and croup.
CHAMBERLAIN’S
COUGH REMEDY.
HOW IT ACTS.
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy assists Nature.
Being purely vegetable, free from all narcotics, it
fulfils the requirements of a perfect cough remedy.
It is soothing and healing. It not only checks
the cough or cold, but assists Nature in throwing
from the system the cause of same, and helps
bring about a condition that renders a second
attack less dangerous. It tones up the mucous
membrane, enabling it to withstand exposure. Its
power to control congestion and inflammation puts
it in a different list from all other cough medi-
cines. Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy loosens the
cough, relieves the lungs, and makes expectora-
tion easy.
Commercial Traveller’s
Experience.
Mr. GEO. P. TIDEMAN, the “Hustling Tra-
veller ” for Messrs. Burns, Philp and Co., Towns-
ville, Queensland, writes: “Just a line to tell
you how grateful I feel for the relief I obtained
while travelling up North. Some time ago I had
a very severe cold, caught whilst sleeping on the
A.U.S.N. Co.’s mail steamer. When I arrived at
Geraldton I felt very mean. My throat was very
bad, and I could hardly speak. Knowing the
benefit other people had received whilst using
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy, I obtained a
bottle from the leading storekeeper there, and
took it according to directions. The first dose
gave me relief, and before I left the town my
cough was quite cured. I must say it did me a lot
of good, and I am now never without a bottle;
also keep some in my home for future use.”
Mother’s Recommendation.
Mrs. MARY GRAY, Wagonga, N. S. Wales,
writes: “Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy has a
splendid reputation in this district, and I know
of many cases where acute croup and bronchitis
have been cured. I had been a sufferer from
bronchial asthma for many years, and never found
any treatment that would relieve me until I com-
menced taking Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy,
and that completely cured me. It has never
failed to cure coughs or chest complaints among
the members of my family. I always keep a
bottle of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy in the
house, and would advise all mothers to do
likewise.”
Officially Declared Free.
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is the only cough
remedy sold in Australasia that has been officially
declared by Australian authorities Free from all
Poisons.
CHAMBERLAIN’S
COUGH REMEDY.
FRIEND TO FRIEND.
The personal recommendations of people who
have been cured of coughs and colds by “Cham-
berlain’s Cough Remedy ” have done more than
all else to make it a staple article of trade and
commerce over a large part of the civilised.:world.
This is especially true in Australia, where by
word of mouth—friend to friend—the good this
remedy is doing is being constantly repeated. We
doubt if there is a single home in the Common-
wealth that has not heard of this household article,
and in the majority it is being used.
Ihe makers of “ Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy ”
do not claim it to be a cure-all. They do, how-
ever, claim it to contain the very best drugs that
money can buy, and also assert that the care used
in course of manufacturing does make it an ideal
cough medicine.
A Tourist’s Praise.
Mr. FRANK W. FRAZER, of Scone, N.S.W.,
writes : “ I was touring New Zealand some time
ago, and, owing to the continued wet weather,
contracted a very severe cold. While staying at
the “ Royal Oak,” in Wellington, a friend advised
me to try Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy. This
advice was followed, and after I had taken a few
doses was completely cured. I can confidently
recommend Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy to any-
one suffering from throat or lung troubles.”
TICKLING IN THE
THROAT.
TRIFLING BUT SIGNIFICANT. ;
This seems trifling, but you know these little
insignificant complaints gradually develop into
the most serious unless checked in time. Nature
invariably sounds the alarm, and if you don’t
heed, disastrous results generally follow. When
there is a tickling in the throat you may rt s
assured there is some cause ; some foreign
substance lodged, or some inflammation. You
must take Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy. You
can feel a.t once its soothing, quietening, and
healing influence. It is no experiment. Not
only does Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy reduce
the inflammation, but strengthens the delicate
lining of the throat; makes it stronger and more
able to throw off pulmonary diseases.
Cough while you can, for after taking Chamber-
lain’s Cough Remedy you can’t cough any moi e.
A certain cure in every bottle.
Henry Lucy has pathetically and lengthily
referred to the breakdown of Tweedmouth, that
first Lord of the British Admiralty who became
famous as the correspondent of Kaiser William.
In a late letter to S. M. Herald, William Amelia
says :
The' first public intimation of anything Wrong’ with
Lord Tweedmouth was his declaration that startled the
House of Lords, airily referring to Mr. Haldane’s cherished
scheme of army reform as “a gamble.”
That, at least, didn’t prove much. If Haldane’s
scheme isn’t a gamble, it isn’t easy to see what
else it is. It abolished that old “constitutional
force,” the Militia, which gave an opening for the
introduction of compulsory service if the need
arose ; it abolished equally the Volunteers and
Yeomanry. It replaced them with what Haldane
called a “Territorial Army,” the idea of which
was elaborated in conjunction with the German
General Staff during Haldane’s trip to Berlin. It
is a colorable imitation of the German Landwehr,
adapted to voluntary-enlistment, and the volun-
tary and universal-service elements won’t com-
bine. If it isn’t a gamble to abolish the known,
serviceable Militia, which gave Britain quite half
its steady infantry during the. Boer War, and re-
place it with a force which has so far failed to
rise to threr-fifths of its paper strength, what
is it ?
When we read the dismal, forebodings of
the Tory press re compulsory military training,
and the wails about it being contrary to the spirit
of liberty, and subversive of all British traditions,
it is interesting to recall that the same kind of
Tory wailed the same kind of wail over compul-
sory school training within the memory of men
who are not yet wholly dead. In 1844, a com-
mittee of theN.S.W. Legislature reported thus -
Your Committee venture to express a hope that no
compulsion will ever be employed to induce parents to
send their children to school. Such a measure is hostile
to the liberty of the subject, and would infallibly arouse
i spirit of determined opposition. -
The report was signed by such allegedly enlight-
ened men as Robert Lowe, Charles Cowper, Deas
Thompson, Dr. Lang, Dr. Nicholson, Therry and
Attorney-GenerahPlunkett. That was 64 years
ago. Sixty-four years hence, the drivellings of
the Sydney Herald and Telegraph against com-
pulsory military training will look just as loony.
In the middle of last century it was an essential
part of the liberty of the subject thq,fc he should
ha\e the right to be dirty and ignorant. Nowit
is an essential feature of liberty that the subject
should have the right to be defenceless. And one
idea is just as silly as the other.
-OCKERSLEY’S HOT PUNCH, Ajus-
tralia’s Most Popular Cordial, is
unrivalled for its Excellence and Purity.
Non-intoxicating, palatable and stimu-
lating, it is a perfect substitute for
alcoholic drinks. It makes a most delec-
table winter beverage, taken with Water,
Aerated Water, Whisky, Wine, or Beer.
Eckersley’s is the only genuine original
Punch, readily identified by the well-
known historic figure of Punch on the
label. Look for this Trade Mark, the
name “Eckersley.” Be careful to sound
the “H” in “HOT” Punch, and avoid
the trader who produces a bottle with
a mutilated label, or who offers an
imitation. At all Hotels, Chemists

For the first time for 47 years the Commer-
cial Bank of Sydney hasn’t got a. director named
Richard Jones. The original Richard Jones was
a compositor, who came out to work on the
Monitor, and afterwards bought the Maitland
Mercury. He passed into politics, became Trea-
surer (it was at his suggestion that Jack Robert-
son was first sent for to form a Ministry), and died
leaving a heap of money and 16 children. Richard
Jones the second, of Harrison, Jones and Devlin,
was one of the children ; he followed his father as
a director of the Commercial, and between them
they have been keeping the veteran T. A. Dibbs
company for the 47 years mentioned above.
The Queensland Government intends to
resume the property known as Pettigrew’s Wharfi
Brisbane ; and that takes one back to the begin'
ning of things in Queensland. William Pettigrew
was one of Dr. Lang’s immigrants, and reached
Brisbane in 1849. Four years later he erected the
first saw-mill in the Moreton Bay district,'and
built a wharf on the site to be resumed. The
mill was burnt down in 1855, and about 20
afterwards a second mill also went up in smoke,
while a third was destroyed in the big Brisbane
flood of 1893. This last loss ruined Pettigrew,
who was an M.L.C. at the time! Soon afterwards
he resigned his seat, and went to live with relatives
at Bowen (Q.), where he died a year or two ago.
And now the old wharf has to go.
“Pick’s” testimony: \
On the 23rd June last, on Mount Dromedary, situated
onl}' two miles from the seashore (South Coast, N.S.W.),
there occurred the third fall of snow within the recollec-
tion of 50 years residents of the vicinity. This apropos
the fact that the anti-Australian newspapers gave wide
publicity to the fact that snow fell at Dalgety on that
date—by way of discrediting the chosen site of the Com-
monwealth capital. It has since transpired that snow
fell, on the same date, at every one of the other proposed l
capital sites, and divers other places as well. One of the
most unconvincing of the State Frights yaps against
Dalgety in the ears of knowledgable folk is that which
has reference to the district’s allegedly evil weather, con-
ditions. During the good seasons of 1884-85 and the
withering droughts of 1886-87, I worked on the
Snowy a few miles below Dalgety, and therefore claim
to know something of its climate. Most assuredly I would
choose the climate of the Snowy in preference to that of
Canberra, Lake George, or Lyndhurst, places whereat I
have also pitched my camp.

HOW BRIGHT’S DISEASE CAN BE AVOIDED
And the SYSTEM CLEANSED.
Flush Your Kidneys
Gravel deposits indicate the urgent
necessity of cleansing the kidneys, which
is perfectly performed by the aid of
Kutnow’s Powder,
Kutnow’s Powder dissolves uric acid
and quickly eliminates it from the
system ; it also cleanses the bladder and
relieves all pain.
Kutnow’s Powder, being free from
sugar, is particularly suitable in cases of
Bright’s disease and diabetes.
GUARD AGAINST FRAUD
The Genuine Kutnow’s Powder can be
had of all conscientious Chemists through-
out the World. See that the fac-simile
signature, “S. KutnoW & Co., Ld.,”
and the registered trade mark,
“ Hirschensprung, or Deer Leap,’’ are
on the carton and bottle. You then get

“ Dear Sirs, —I have much pleasure
in recommending Kutnow's Powder
to anyone suffering from kidney com-
plaint. My wife has suffered from
chronic Bright's Disease for over ten
years, and I can truthfully say that
she is quite a different woman after
taking two bottles. You are at liberty
to send anyone to her to testify as to
the truth of this statement. I always
intend to keep a bottle by me, as it
does its work gently and effectively.

“ Gentlemen, —Having lately returned
from South Africa, where I contracted
Kidney and Liver troubles (among other
ills), I have been more than ever con-
vinced of the merits of Kutnow’s Powder
in restoring those organs to their proper
functions. Indeed, I feel impelled to
write and express my gratitude for the
benefits I have derived from its use. I
may add that I always have a bottle by
me.—Yours faithfully,

WRITES :

“ Sirs, —Some five years ago I had an
acute attack of nephritis (inflammation
of the kidneys), and my doctor advised
Harrogate waters. After trying them
for some time with very little result, the
doctor suggested giving Kutnow’s Powder
a trial, with such excellent result that in
a short time I felt very much better. I
continued taking it regularly every other
day for two years, and consider it worked
an entire cure.

KUTNOW’S POWDER ENSURES GOOD HEALTH


From the Violet- Town (Vic.) Sentinel
(17/7/’08) :
NOTICE.
■A PUBLIC MEETING will be held, this (Friday)
' evening’ in-the Mechanics’ Hall to consider the
advisability of extending a welcome to our worthy
and most respected market gardener, Ah Chung, who
has just returned from a trip to his native country.
I J. E. Croxford, G. W. Neil, T. G. Hoskin, and
W. E. Hill, Conveners.
It is mere doll-house make-believe to pre-
sent Carruthers as a doughty knight wresting from
the Bank of England a 12.) per cent, reduction in
the charge for the inscription and management of
the N.S.W. debt. Such charges are subject to
periodical alteration, and a reduction which is justi-
fied on business grounds could be as readily secured
by i official correspondence as by personal visits.
As a rule, in fact, the matter is all fixed up by
letter beforehand, but if a person like Hector
thinks of going to England it is considered best
not to mention it till he gets there. Then he
poses as the individual who went and personally
tore the reduction from the jaws of the ravening
lion at the bank, and thus saved the State the cost
of his trip many times over.
From the Queanbeyan Age (N.S.W.) of
July 14 (the writer is apparently a returned pro-
digal of some sort): —
Around Canberra and Gininderra one does not see
much change, excepting in the case of the former one
notices an alteration for the worse in the vast accumula-
tion of unsightly debris —stone, gravel, sheep manure and
vegetable deposit—swept down from the heights of
Mount Ainslev, lodging on the pasture lands to a depth
which seriously depreciates their grazing qualities, and
lying inches deep in the hollows of the road over which
the phenomenal storm of some months back poured its
waters till they must have been almost level with the
fence tops.
Now how did all this debris and sheep manure
get on to Wade’s wonderful proposed Federal
capital site ?
“ The Swimmer ” :
Rua, the long-haired chief who is causing the Maori-
land Government some trouble by his preposterous
claims and influence over the Urewera natives, is a
prophet of more tonnage than a recent Bulletin corre-
spondent indicates. He is a queer mixture of Dowie and
the Maori-tohunga, or wizard. He is likewise a bit of a
Solpmon, and more than a bit of a Brigham Young. I
have recently returned-from the Urewera country (Bay
of Plentj' district, North Island), where Rua has built a
settlement for himself and his followers on the side of a
steep mountain. In this township, which few white men
have seen, the Ruaites lead the simple life near to Nature’s
heart. Rua is a perfect Dowie in Bis aversion to tobacco
arid alcohol, and all his followers are non-smokers and
abstainers. As the Mabris—men, women, and children—
are incessant smokers, the Ruaites’ abstention shows the
influence that Rua exercises over the most obstinate
of the primal races. Rua’s town, which is called
Maungapohatu, is well laid out and neatly constructed.
It is also clean, and in this respect forms a striking con-
trast to the ordinary native pah. Its strangest feature
is a quaintly-carved and decorated temple, where the
Ruaites worship and conduct their public affairs. The
principal decorations are carved aces of clubs and
diamonds, said to possess some significance known only
to Rua, who is undoubtedly the joker of the pack. Rua
and his numerous wives live in a sixteen-roomed house
built by his followers. Rua is the only Maori chief of the
preSent day who goes in for a harem, and he has borrowed
the Mormon idea of having each additional partner re-
vealed and sealed to him in a vision. The revelation
invariably points to one of the prettiest and young-est
ivahines in the tribe, and she is sent to him without ques-
tion. Rua reconciles his bigamous tendencies with his |
Christianity by taking Solomon as his bright shining
example, and he says he is “ poor ” compared with that
much-married monarch. He may be poor as far as wives
are concerned, but he is well off in other respects,
as many of the natives have stripped them-
selves of everything in order to add to his
comfort. He claims to be the modern incarnation of the-
Messiah, come to save the world. Many of the Maoris of
the surrounding tribes have left their own people to
throw in their lot with the Ruaites, and Rua is waxing
absurdly prosperous as a result. The Maoriland Govern-
ment is anxious to open up the Urewera country, which
is supposed to be very rich in gold, but Rua wants
staggering royalties before be will allow this to be done.
Rua also has dreams of a native Government, with himself
at the head of affairs, and gives himself all the airs of a
full-blown sovereign.

MEN! DON’T
TAKE DRUGS!
WHY don’t you stop it? You are still doctoring, but changing doctors does not cure
you. You are trying one medicine after the other with the same disgusting disappoint-
ment. You are a “ medicine doser,” and the only change in your'condition is for the worse.
Why don’t you stop this medicine habit ? Why don’t you avail yourself of
the modern remedy ? Proceed on Nature’s own lines. Use the life-giving, healing,
strengthening forces of Electricity! This is the eledtric age. You can see on every
hand the wonders of Electricity. You don’t need doctors; you don’t need medicine,
for medicine gives no nourishment. You DO need Electric Life Force. Use it as we
apply it and you will be well, strong and happy. !
Nearly every ailment which .afflicts humanity, outside of contagious diseases, is due to the brealcing-
down of some vital organ. When a certain part fails to do its allotted task the entire human
machinery, goes to smash. The only way to regain health—even life —is to rebuild the weak part
which has caused all the trouble by obtaining a new supply of vital electric energy. This can
only be properly done with the new improved
DR. McLAUGHUN’S ELECTRIC BELT.
There is no disputing the virtue in Electricity as a cure for weakness and pains. The brainiest doctors living now admit it, but there has
been a doubt that anyone had mastered the best way of applying it. The doctor’s battery is crude—shocks too much, and at best can only be
applied for half-an-hour at a time, which is not enough to do any good. Those other machines in a doctor’s office never reach the.trouble. . .
Electricity, as applied by DR. McLAUGHLIN’S ELECTRIC BELT, is the modern, up-to date method. No shock, no burning' or
blistering, and you wear it for hours at a time while sleeping or during the day.
£5OO REWARD.
We guarantee every Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt sold by us to give a powerful current of
genuine electricity which can be instantly felt, and we will forfeit £5OO to anyone proving
the contrary.
./.t is a quick and lasting cure for Debility, Weakness of all kinds, Varicocele, Rheumatism, Weak Back, Sciatica,
iitimbago, Indigestion, Weak Kidneys, Failing Memory, and all evidence of Break-Down.

An unlearned observer writes :
I dropped in at the Inman v. Lindrum, junr.,
billiard match the other night. When I arrived,
the Englishman was in play, and was just finishing
a break of 88. What an interesting looking creatqre
is this Inman ! As he bends over the table his
expression is one of pained concentration and
terrible gravity. One would think, looking at him, that
each stroke of the cue was a penance—a part of a self-set
ritual. Away from the table, his face—somewhat bird-
like in profile—resumes an expression of lifeless super-
ciliousness—that of an aesthete thrust into a mob of
Philistines against his wish. He seems to be apart from
the crowd. Lindrum, on the other hand, appears to be
much more at home, though he looks much more out of
place. His place, I should imagine, would have been
behind a grocer’s counter, weighing out sugar, if heredity
and early training had not made him an expert cueist.
He is a healthy-looking juvenile, quite undistinguished,
and the happy possessor of a most inartistic grin. On
occasion he can scarcely conceal this grin, as, when re-
questing his opponent to move out of the wav, he was
deafeningly applauded, much to Inman’s discomfort.
And that little incident showed me that a billiard
crowd differs but little from a football crowd. Palpably
biassed in favor of the youth—probably through
the pure sentiment of nationality—this crowd was
inclined, on occasion, to applaud liis showy shots and
fortunate ones, and to deny Inman a good deal
of credit for less obvious generalship. Naturally enough,
Inman, both by age and experience, is the greater
tactician, and is consequently not altogether attractive
to the mere amateur maker of “ hundreds-up ” in a pub.
There are few experts in a crowd, few educated suf-
ficiently to appreciate strategy behind a seemingly motive-
less shot; but there are many, I should think, quite
intelligent enough to perceive the skilful and the super-
ficial. I should not go so far as to say that this crowd
was “ one-eyed,” but its friendliness to its countryman
gave him immense confidence. I saw him knock up 156
“ off the red” with remarkable ease, the ball returning to
within a few inches of its previous position after every
shot. That earned for him a round of well-merited
applause. But I should like to see him in a losing position
and among an antipathetic crowd.
Mrs. Trevanion, the Australian lady (she was'a
Miss Cooper, of Sydney) who married into the
British peerage, is having some curious ex-
periences. She started a judicial separation
suit last year against her husband, Hugh
Arundell Trevanion, who was required (27/l/’08)
while the same was pending to give the
Court an undertaking that he would not in any
way molest the petitioner. Last March she got
two post-cards. The first was addressed :
Florence Eva Trevanion, n&e Cooper,
The Middle,aged Complainant, in the
Bexhill Libel Suit,
77 Campden Hill Court,
London. Kensington.
On the other side were the words
Take some gin, old woman ; you will want it.
The second card was dated March 10. The
address side read in large letters : -
Mrs. F. E. Trevanion (Grass Widow),
77 Campden Hill Court,
London. Kensington.
On the reverse side :
A meeting will be held at the Bexhill Police Court
on Saturday to decide how to manage a husband and
keep him from straying. As you married the same
man twice, and had great experience, you are re-
quested to attend and relate how well you succeeded.
The cards, said counsel, were, according to Mrs.
Trevanion’s- opinion, in the handwriting of her
husband. However that may be, the humor of
these efforts is not excessive, nor is the good
taste ; but the venom is there in good and over-
flowing measure.

HEARNES
BRONCHITIS
CURE
The Famous Remedy For
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, & CONSUMPTION,
Has the Largest Sale of any Chest Medicine in the World.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Its healing power is marvellous. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of
Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it
effects a Complete Cure. It is most comforting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become
chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has never been known to exist where “ Coughs" have been properly treated with this medicine. No house
should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient, and a Complete Cure is certain.
BeWare of ImitationS ! The great success of HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE, has induced a number
of unprincipled persons to make imitations, each calling his medicine “ Bronchitis Cure,” with the object of
deceiving the simple-minded, and so getting a sale for an imitation which has none of the beneficial effects that
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE has. Consequently it has become necessary to draw your attention to this fact,
and to request you in your own interests to be particular to ask for HEARNE’S and to see that you get it.
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE, Small Size, 2/6; Large Size, 4/6. Sold by Chemists and Medicine Vendors, and by the
Proprietor, W. G. HEARNE, Chemist, Geelong, Victoria. Forwarded to any Address, when not obtainable locally.
NOTlCE.—Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure No. lAdoes NOT contain any poison within the meaning of the Act. It is equally beneficial for the youngest
child and the most aged person.
BENGER’S FOOD is quite
distinct from any other. It
possesses the remarkable property
of rendering milk with which it
is mixed when used, quite easy of
digestion by Infants and Invalids.
One of the most valuable foods
known to science. It gives the
body abundance of nourishment,
with complete or partial rest to
the digestive system, regulated
as may be advisable.
Benger s Food is sold in tins by Chemists, etc., everywhere.

CONDITIONS.
All Limericks submitted must be original, and refer to
Laxo-Tonic Pills. There is no Entrance Fee, but
each Limerick must be accompanied by the wrapper
from around a Laxo-Tonic Pill Box.
The wrapper off a IOJd. box of Laxo-Tonic Pills entitles
competitors to one attempt, and the wrapper off a Is. 6d.
box entitles them to two attempts.
All Limericks received, whether they are awarded prizes
or not, are to become the property of the Laxo-Tonic Pill
Company, and they may publish same at any time if they
desire.
The Winner of the First Prize can take the trip at any
time within six months after the closing of the Competi-

wore money. For instance, a trip to America or England
could be arranged. Should circumstances arise to pre-
vent the winner taking a trip at all, the privilege is ex-
tended of giving or selling the ticket to anyone they wish,
but no monetary consideration will be allowed in lieu of
same.

send the name of your local chemist or storekeeper.
This competition is for the means of getting Limericks
for advertising purposes, and Limericks are judged
according to the value for this purpose. Competitors
will do well to bear this in mind, and make their Limericks
rational, and not to submit verses recommending the
Pills for Bubonic on account of the fact that the word
rhymes with Laxo-Tonic.
Style of Limericks preferred.
The following are samples of Limericks which will show
the style preferred
A woman of Woolloomooloo
Asserted with emphasis, “'Pooh,’
“ I never get ill,
Laxo-Tonic’s my pill—
Keep ’em handy—the same as I do.”
A lovely young lady of Forbes,
The pill Laxo-Tonic absorbs ;
She vows it perfection,
For health and complexion—
Worth coronets, sceptres and orbs !
Post your Limericks at once, so they may receive the
careful consideration which they deserve. Address same
to the Original Limerick Competition, No. 4, c/o Laxo-
Tonic Pill Company, 15 O’Connell Street, Sydney.
WINNER OF FIRST PRIZE
in No. 3 Competition.
The following Limerick won the First Prize (the 7000-
mile tour round the South Seas, New Zealand, and
Tasmania) in the No. 3. Competition :
Awarded to Mrs. COXHEAD, 7 Geelong-road,
Footscray (Vic.).
On the railroad you hear of their fame,
If you cross the wide ocean the same ;

Cure ills that are chronic,
And thousands are blessing their name.
Laxo-Tonic Pills.
It has long been recognised by the Medical Profession
that if a Pill could be invented which was laxative in
principle, and still at the same time was of known tonic
value, that same would fill a long-felt want. The great
difficulties to overcome were that most of the known
vegetable tonics were all strong astringents, so that,
while the administration of these tonics proved of great
value to the patient as a stimulant, still they were very
prone to greatly interfere with his digestion, and cause
stomach trouble ; also, to add to the difficulty, the effect
of most all vegetable cathartics was to weaken, distress,
and sicken, so that while the patient might be relieved
by the action of the cathartic, he was also greatly
depressed by the weakening and sickening of the entire
system. To overcome these difficulties was of more
moment than at first appeared, and it was only after
several years of intricate chemical research that the com-
bination known as LAXO-TONIC PILLS was invented.
These Pills have accomplished many wonderful cures.
Try them yourself and be convinced.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THEY tell us that Romance is dead
And faded Sentiment,
That Poesy’s foliage is shed
And fairy treasures spent.
But when I see the world acquire
Its faded charms anew
’Neath daily magic of desire
That wafts ’tween me and you,
I contradict that heresy
Of purblind commonplace,
And say Romance and Mystery
Crowd every nook of Space.
The bowing trees are all a-song
The time we are to meet,
The very way you walk along
Becomes a Holy Street.
The evening train you travel by
Unusual radiance hath,
As if the windows of the sky
Were oped along its path.
There is no need to search the brain
For trope and image new
To deck the altar of the strain
My love would build for you.
The common things about, above
The common iPad to-day.
Are prattling hourly of our love
And tell me what to say.
Where’er you go, sing hand in hand
A garland-throwing choir
That make the world a fairyland
For him of your desire.
The very seasons seem in tune,
And genial summers try
To throw their frontiers into June
And backward to July.
Away are habit’s curtains rolled
When you are by my side,
Till common things are aureoled.
And sordid dignified.
The marvel-hand of Love uplifts-
The world above its clay,
The veils that hide the Real it shifts
Till everywhere is Day.
So dear to God is Love that He
Such omnipresence gives
To her we love that her we see
In all that charms or lives.
So you are in the sky, the bush,
The movement and the calm ;
Yours is the trill of the mountain thrash,
The glory of the psalm.
You peer atween the clustered vine,
And on the cloud-boats row ;
You curve in statue’s perfect line,
In perfect poem glow.
I see you now in Seraph’s dress,
With fairy wings anon,
You are the gloaming’s eeriness,
The promise of the dawn.
Yea, searching deeplier I find
You cause of cause within
Majestic turmoils of the mind
’Gainst ignorance and sin.
For the ship of love has a mystic erew
That bears the tolls we owe
To future ports, for life we drew
From sailors long ago.
So that her path from chance be free
All shoals we must remove—
Tis thus in Progress' face we- see
The form of her we love.
Heroic selfless thoughts that keep
My soul to the helpless true,
I see to vi vid action leap
Through you and such as you.
O the light of love is a magic light,
It gifts its favored race
With the sympathetic second-sight
To pierce the commonplace.
Yes, every leaf’s a door of truth,
And on air I seem to walk ;
And how of sun and hope and youth
The whole world seems to talk !
There’s nothing paltry now nor mean,
I’ve not a foe on earth ;
0 why have sages never seen
That Love’s the Second Birth ?

The Shepherd Kings of
Canterbury.
THE PATRIARCH OF FERNLEIGH..
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FERNLEIGH Station was the most delight-
ful property in all Canterbury, and its
owner, Stephen Ridley Osborne, a most,
interesting character. He had come to Maori-
land in the very early days with a certain Squire
Osborne, who had placed a hunk of Nbrf.h Devon
on two sailing ships and transplanted it bodily.
In those days his name was not Osborne,, only
Stephen Ridley, and as religion was in the blood
it was possible that there was something in the
proud boast of the family that it could trace its-
descent from the brother of that Ridley who- had
died at the stake in the reign of Sanguinary Mary,
Old Devonian Osborne was not sure of the
•country, he was coming to—report said its was in-
fested with wild animals, with vast birds-that stood
-16 ft. high, and with wild savages, called Maoris,
who fought fiercely with battleaxes made of pure
•emeralds. So he brought with him a- sturdy
tend and enough arms and ammunition to serve
for the conquest of the whole island.
Instead of a half-naked savage with a green-
stone axe, prancing about a blood-stained strand,
young Ridley and his master found a hairy indi-
vidual in the pants of civilisation, who flourished
a sheet of parchment which declared that the
Crown had been pleased to grant most of North
Canterbury to the Church of England for the
purpose of founding a colony on the parson,
squire, and tenant lines. But the man who held
the parchment was quite willing to allow Squire
Osborne to lease land for settlement.
Osborne took counsel with his clerk, and
Ridley, who inclined to Low Churchism, strenu-
ously urged him to have nothing to do with the
fiend who held the parchment. So the Squire
fitted together the waggons which he had brought
from England, loaded up the goods and chattels
that he had brought from England, set his face to
the southward, and with his tiny flock and minia-
ture herd trekked away into the sea of waving,
golden tussock, armed servants scouting in front
and on the flanks, and a rear-guard keeping a
sharp lookout for the man with the parchment.
Sitting in his own library at Fernleigh, where
the cornice of beaten copper glinted richly in the
soft kerosene light, Squatter Ridley Osborne used
to tell me of the incidents of that trek from where
Christchurch now stands. They passed over
beautiful land, but the parchment included it all,
and at last they came to naked, dreary, wind-
swept plains, where even the soil was blown
away. Squire Osborne wanted to turn back, but
Ridley reminded him that the desert lay between
Egypt and the Promised Land, and swore that
the Spirit urged him forward, and the old
Devonian allowed him to have his way. Much
study of the Prophets had made Ridley impressive,
if nothing else.
They had crossed many blue rivers flowing
over shingle the color of silver, between vast cliffs
or terraces, and at last they emerged where a
patch of forest swept from the plains up imufioi the
outlying spurs of the great Southern Alps, which
had lifted their blue, snow-tipped masses to their
right all the journey.
“ Is this the spot the Spirit led you to, think
you ? ” inquired Squire Osborne. And Ridley
assured him it was. So they explored the bush |
to make sure it contained no savages, and found
only wild pigs and a wonderful assortment of
ferns. Later on, they found an old battlefield,
with skulls and skeletons still mixed promis-
cuously with greenstone axes and spear-heads.
It looked as though the victors had fled from the
field without waiting to gather either dead or
plunder, and the old squire argued that where
these savages had fought in such numbers they
might return. Accordingly the station home-
stead, instead of being built of timber from the
forest, wa§ constructed of the grey, iron-stained
boulders which covered the surface of the country.
Round it was erected a wall of the same, and
covered ways led to bastions at the corners.
Later on the fields were fenced with walls made
of the stones which the ploughs turned up. They
made good fences and better breakwinds.
* * * *
Some years afterwards, while these two queer I
beings were riding along discussing the Prophets :
and Revelation, the old squire’s horse put his
hoof in a hole, and broke his own fetlock and his
rider’s neck.
When the little community returned from plac-
ing the old squire’s body in the boulder mausoleum
on the edge of the ribbonwood grove that looks
towards where the sun goes down beyond mighty
Mount Somers, Ridley asked two of the men to go
through the squatter’s papers, and in less than an
hour they discovered a will which left everything
to Stephen Ridley on condition that he never
parted with the property, took the name of
Osborne, and looked after the worldly welfare of
everybody who had belonged to the expedition
when it left England. Every retainer was given
a life interest in the place, and the old squatter
would take his pipe from his mouth, glance at the
gleaming copper cornice, and say, very solemnly :
“ Saving such as the Lord hath taken to Him-
self, they are all here yet, and I hope that I have
done my duty to them.”
* * * *
Increased years found him a dourer student of
the Prophets than ever. Fernleigh was a valu-
able property, and the Lord blessed it aed put
wisdom into the heart of its owner. With wind-
mills and automatic pumps he forced the water
from the Rangitata into the elevated tanks that
were dotted over the fields within their stone
breakwinds, and when all the rest of Central
Canterbury was scorched by drouth while the ice-
fed rivers roared bankers between their giant
terraces, Fernleigh was a verdant paradise where
the kine walked knee-deep in red clover.
The old stone fortress remained as it was first
built, but at the back of it another building had
:gone up. It was a school for the children of the
station, for Ridley Osborne would have no single
men about the place, barring himself. The old
dining-room of the fortress had been turned into a
library. Conservatories had sprung up around
the orchards and lawns, and the houses of the
dependents had masses 'of flowers about them,
and through the gardens and plantations echoed
the laughter of children. * Squatter Osborne, re-
peating scraps of Isaiah to himself, would ride round
on an old roan cob, and if there was a kid that had
fallen down and hurt his nose, the squatter was
the first to pick him up and comfort him with a
shilling or the promise of a new book. Or
did some wool-laden hogget get cast, and begin
to regard with apprehension the sight of a soaring
eagle-hawk in the distant blue, Squatter Osborne
would ride up on his old roan cob, and set him on
his feet with a verse of Scripture to comfort him.
Among the squatters who had sprang up all
around him this man was spoken of as “the
Renegade of Fernleigh ” ; because he encouraged
small settlers, and subdivided much of the out-
lying portions of his estate to give them room for
settlement. When / every other squatter from
Rakaia to Waimate was actively engaged in block-
ing settlement, Osborne cropped some thousands
of acres in order to give the boycotted small
farmers the means tp tide over the evil day.
The squattocracy grew angry —and when it got
really vexed the squattocracy was dangerous.
Ridley Osborne climbed on to the top of his grey
-old fortress one night to watch his out-station go

THE BATTLE OF LIFE.
Efficiency Depends upon Health. Health Depends upon the Kidneys.
Eveiy man or woman who works must keep healthy, if work is to he done efficiently. The unfit go to the wall. Good
work depends upon good health. Work becomes a nightmare to those who are not well. ABE YOG EFFICIENT?
Or are you Depressed, Tired, Suffering from Broken Sleep, Backache, Pains in the Limbs, Bad Taste in the Mouth ? All
these are symptoms that your kidneys are weak or diseased, and unable to carry out their work of filtering the blood and
keeping it pure. The Kidneys are the Filters of Life. All these
symptoms are forerunners of Dropsy, Bheumatism, Urinary
Diseases, Gravel, Stone, Neuralgia, all of which are Kidney Dieases.
Only a kidney medicine can cure you. Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills act on the kidneys, and on the kidneys only. They will keep
you bright, free from pain, backache and headache. They will
keep you efficient.
Lasting Sydney Cure.
Mr. John Loaney, 20 Swanson Street, Erskineville, states : —“ I wish to give you particulars of my
experience with Doan's Backache Kidney Pills. I owe these Pills a debt of gratitude, for they have cured
me of very serious Kidney disease. My ill-health commenced three years ago, when I first had to lay
up. I had terrible pains in my back and right side, and my secretions scalded, and were thick, and con-
tained sedimentary matter. I also had fits of giddiness, and every day I would have a violent headache.
For two years I spent an average of two weeks out of every three in bed, and even when I was up I was
very ill. I was very weak, and fell away.. I had the best medical advice and treatment to be procured ;
ten leading Sydney Physicians treated me in the three years of my illness; their bills totalled £lBO.
The general idea was that I suffered with stone in the kidneys, and I was constantly advised to undergo
an operation. At last a Specialist put me under the X-Rays ;he found no foreign substance in the kid-
neys, but a dark veil enveloped the right kidney, showing pronounced disease. He told me that it was
unnecessary to be operated on, as my kidneys were too far gone for an operation to benefit me.
“ I gave up all hope of recovery, and fully expected to die soon, and my friends were of the same
opinion. My lawyer was brought home, and made out my will—l was held up to sign it. Not long after
this I was advised to use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. The man who had urged me to give this remedy
a trial had been cured by it, and had the utmost faith in its healing properties. He told me he had been
doubled up with the ailment, and not able to get about at all, and one box had cured him, and for good.
One could not but be convinced that he was in thorough earnest, so I sent for a supply to Ellis’s Pharmacy,
Erskineville. I used nine boxes, and was cured. I felt no good effects until I was using the third box,
and after that my recovery was gradual. I left off taking the Pills four months ago, and have not needed
to take one since, and am still in the best of health.’
On 9th February, 1907, Mrs. Loaney says “ The above is true, and lam pleased to sav my husband
is still free of kidney trouble. In fact he was never better in his life, and is without ache or pain. I
think this is marvellous, for ho is 76.”

up in smoke and flame, and to see a tussock fire
s veep across his grazing land that was held on
lease from the Crown.
Next morning the smoke from the miles of
burning country precipitated a thin drizzling rain,
and the fires died down.
* * * *
Fernleigh station was bounded on the north by
that of Oterama, and the fires had come from the
nor’-west. By mid-day of the morning the fires
had been swamped, the rain was pouring, falling
in sheets. At Oterama the family was all within,
when there was a sound of many horse-hoofs on
the gravel of the front carriage drive. Ashby of
Oterama went to his front window and uttered
an exclamation, and the family crowded round to
see, drawn up in a long line in front of the house, a
force of armed horsemen. In front stood Squatter
Osborne on his old roan cob, and he pointed his
hunting crop at the startled squatter behind the
window :
“Come out, John Ashby, and answer truth-
fully, if you dare ! ”
In a moment the Ashby family reappeared at
the windows armed. Squatter Osborne waved his
hunting crop, and all in a flash that line of horse-
men had swung their horses round, and sat like
statues with their rifles pointed at the windows of
Oterama drawing-room, ready to pour in a volley.
The old man smiled grimly, and then rode up to
the window at which the pale face of Squatter
Ashby still showed.
“ Open the window, John Ashby !”
Ashby opened it.
“My out-station is in ashes, my grass for miles
has gone in smoke—for that you can answer to
our Lord on Judgment Day, John Ashby; but
for the anguish of my poor burnt sheep you shall
answer now. My heart is broken at the sight of
their poor burned bodies. We have cut the throats
of hundreds in mercy. And, John Ashby, I know
that you and yours are responsible for it. But
that your wicked soul would go straight to per-
dition I would send you to the Lord to answer
for it now. ’Tis useless to appeal to the law, and
I’ll not waste time doing it. The Lord will re-
pay ! But I’ll hold my hand no more. Next
time my sheep are burnt, or my grass set on fire
to the risk of burning my helpless sheep, I’ll take
my warrant from the Scripture : An eye for an
eye and a tooth for a tooth shall it be, and I’ll
come down with these ” (and he waved his crop
at the men behind him), “and I’ll burn your
homestead over the heads of you and yours, and
shoot you like dogs if you resist. This is a true
and faithful promise, John Ashby, and may the
Lord forget me if I do it not.”
Then he turned his horse’s head, and in a
moment he and his band had vanished in the
sheets of falling rain.
It was dusk when that grim cavalcade arrived
at the homestead at The Oaks, the station which
shared Fernleigh’s northern boundary with
Oterama. As they came riding up the carriage-
drive between the rowan trees, across the tennis
and croquet lawns, they saw that The Oaks was
crowded with armed men who looked out from
every window. Every man on The Oaks had
been concentrated at the homestead.
The men of Fernleigh spread out and took up
positions behind the trees, and the old man again
rode up to the house and made the same
true and faithful promise he had left at Oterama.
A young man leaned out of the window and
laughed in his face :
“ What do you think we’d be doing all the
time, Ridley Osborne ? ”
The wrath that had been pent up all day burst
out, and the old man struck the young one across
the face with his riding crop, making a red stain.
A rifle cracked, the old roan cob gave a bound,
and in a moment was across the lawn and half-
way down the carriage-drive. Someone else fired,
and then came one ringing volley as the men of
Fernleigh poured in their fire. The Snider bullets
ripped their way through sash and weatherboard,
and buried themselves in the inside walls.
Then there was a pause. Not a shot came from
the house. Only the rain poured down on the
iron roofs, and the men of Fernleigh waited to see
what they of The Oaks would do. The minutes
passed, and then a white handkerchief fastened to
a walking-stick was thrust through a window, and
a young girl stepped out into the pouring rain.
“ We don’t fight with women. Let your father
come out, my girl ! ” shouted Osborne.
“ He cannot —he’s wounded —half our people
are injured. We had no intention of firing on
you. It was one of the young men. Some of
our people joined in the firing of your grass, but
father had nothing to do with it. The Ashbys
came along and proposed it, and some of our
people went with them without father’s know-
ledge. We knew when they returned, but that
was too late.”
“ How many of your people are down ?” said
the old man, stepping out from behind the tree
where he had taken shelter.
“ Nine,” said the girl, beginning to weep.
“ Well, let it be a lesson to them to burn
living sheep no more. We’ll not shoot more, but
I hope those who are hit are those most to blame.
I’ll come within and see the damage.”
He saw the place was a wreck, and, although
no one was mortally wounded, there were some
very bad cases.
After that there were no more fires on Fern-
leigh Station.
* * * *
The end of Ridley Osborne was pathetic.
Among the small settlers who, owing to his en-
couragement, came creeping up the river bed,
was one Hawke. Hawke was a hard-working
man, whose family consisted of two sons and a
daughter. Driving home to Fernleigh one night
in his dog-cart, Osborne overtook Hawke plod-
ding along in his dray. The two boys and the
girl were seated beside him ; the girl being about
17 years of age at the time. Old Osborne noticed
that she was beautiful of feature and plump of
figure. He stared at her for a moment, and then
requested Hawke to get out of the dray as he
wished to speak to him privately. Hawke took a
seat in the dog-cart. When asked what he. in-
tended to do with his daughter, he said he sup-
posed she must just go to service on one of the
stations. Osborne was too horrified to speak for
a few moments, and then he opened his Bible and
thrust many startling texts under Hawke’s be-,
wildered visage. The kernel of it all was that
Osborne knew his brother squatters, and knew
that the girl was too beautiful to be sent to any
sheep station, where all the pretty maids ended
the same wav. For in those days Canterbury had
hot grown respectable. Hawke admitted that the
risk was horrible, but could see little else for it.
His shingle patch in the river-bed was a heart-
breaking proposition, and but for the work he got
on Fernleigh he admitted that he would have well
nigh starved. Osborne said he would think over
it, and Hawke went back to his dray.
Next day Hawke got word that Mr. Osborne
would pay for the teaching of the girl, in Christ-
church, any trade that she would care to follow,
and at the end of the week she started for the
cathedral city.
* * * *
It was four years before Osborne saw her again.
Then, for the first time in his long, strenuous life,
the old man made a fool of himself. He proposed
marriage to her, and was accepted. When Can-
terbury heard it, it just sat back and gasped, and
when it got its breath the squattocracy said it was
only right that the renegade should marry his
adopted class. It gasped some more when it heard
that the old stone fortress was demolished and
that a lovely structure of glass and brick was
going up in its place.
The building and furnishing of Fernleigh man-
sion cost ,£35,000. The daughter of Cocky
Hawke walked on Persian pile carpets, made in
Ispahan, into which the foot sank as it does into
clover, and which sprang up into place again
when the foot was removed. The top of every
wall gleamed with copper cornices beaten by a
specially imported metal worker. Her bedroom
was surrounded on two sides by a conservatory,
from which it was divided by a vast unbroken
sheet of glass the full length of the room. The
conservatory was so arranged as to give to a person
in the great pearlshell and silver bed the impres-
sion of looking over leagues of bright blooms
with scraps of blue sky showing between the
palms overhead. An English organ was built in
a room with stained glass windows and tinted
tiles. In fact, Osborne gave his wife everything
that the heart of a young woman could desire—
everything but a young man to help her appre-
ciate it ; and him Mrs. Osborne soon found for
herself.
* ■ * * *
He was dressed in the grey knickerbocker
suit that was the hall-mark of young squatterdom,
and the old man, kneeling down, shot steadily as
the grey figure fled across the moonlit lawn. But
his nerve was shaken at his discovery, and the
grey figure reached the line of the hazel nut grove,
and his whoop told that he realised he was safe.
The men brought the horses round at a canter,
and the old squatter served out the rifles hastily,
and then threw himself into the saddle. They
clattered down the long drive into the clover
field. They saw the grey horseman break cover
from the plantations nearly half-a-mile ahead; he
had evidently experienced some delay in getting
ys horse. He made for the river-bed, and
the Osborne party strained every nerve to head
him off. He held on gamely, although he must
have known that once in range the bullets would
start to fall around him. But he had no chance of
reaching the river-bed by the road, and suddenly
he sprang from his horse and raced on foot for the
edge of the. terrace. Osborne’s party reached the
edge just in time to see him disappear round the
corner of the shoulder, from which jutted out a
couple of cabbage trees. It was a frightfully
daring thing, for at any moment tons of loose
shingle might have come toppling over him.
When he reached the bottom he must have walked
along till right below the party, and then made a
sudden dash for a clump of timber.
They galloped down the road to that timber,
for they knew that, without a horse, he could
never cross the river. As they went they spread
out fanwise to prevent him slipping through their
line. Suddenly they pulled up. Osborne bade
his men wait. He had caught the glint of gun-
barrels in the moonlight, and he went on alone.
“ We’re euchred,” he said laconically when he
came back ; “ there are eight of them there, and
every one of them with a Snider. Let him go,
it’s not worth anyone getting shot over.”
At midnight Mrs. Osborne started for Christ-
church per waggonette, to live on £4 per week
for the rest of her life. Before the coachman
took his place beside her, Ridley Osborne called
him aside.
“ If there is anything in the house, big or little,
that you fancy, take it before you go. It may not
be here when you return. It’s no use keeping
this place any longer.”
The coachman helped himself to a picture or
two and a bronze of a horse at full gallop, gave
them to the cook to take care of till he returned,
and drove off. The rest of the servants having
made their selections and taken'out their belong-
ings, the Master of Fernleigh went to the library
and set it on fire.
Across the clear moonlight night the fire was
visible for miles. From every direction horsemen
came galloping in to lend a hand at saving the
beautiful homestead, but were waved back by the
Fernleigh people. On a stump on the lawn sat
the old squatter smoking quietly, while his splen-
did house made a beacon of warning against ill-
assorted marriages.
“We’ll be happier in a simpler home,” he said
sadly as he went down to the gardener’s house to
sleep in the spare room. But that faithless wife
got the best of it all in the end, for next day the
poor, wronged old man rode off by himself to see
his wife’s lover, whom he said he had recognised.
He went alone, and when night fell he had not
returned.
The people of Fernleigh went out with lanterns
to search the river bed, for the Rangitata is a
treacherous torrent.
They found the mortal remains of Ridley
Osborne on the shingle bank that rises like a
silver streak: in the midst of the blue ice water, a
few hundred yards below the ford. Mrs. Osborne
was a daughter of the Rangitata, and it had
killed her husband before he had time to alter his
will.
