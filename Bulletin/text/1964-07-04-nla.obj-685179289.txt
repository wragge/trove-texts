There’s no more exacting master than Tradition
The Yalumba tradition began with Samuel Smith who, in 1849, founded a vineyard to produce
wines equal to any in the world. A claret born of these concepts is Yalumba Galway Vintage.
Blended from Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz varieties, Galway Vintage is an elegant, yet
delightfully light, claret. Connoisseurs seek it out. Royal Show judges honour its quality. Galway
Vintage Claret, by Yalumba, is indeed worth asking for.

LETTERS
TO THE
EDITOR
THE INDONESIANS
Sir,
M. L. Waddington (20/6/64) might
not be so enamoured of Indonesia’s
war-mongering and economy-shattering
role in S-E Asia if he had lived here
for 17 years as I have. It’s one thing
to “love” the relatively enlightened
individuals of Indonesia whom he has
apparently met in Australia, but it’s
quite another matter to condone that
country’s conduct of its foreign affairs.
The Indonesian leaders themselves are
unquestionably to blame for the appal-
ling picture of internal graft and gross
mismanagement of their vast natural
resources; and to camouflage this to
their own people, the Communist bloc
and the more gullible of the Afro-Asian
countries, they have resorted to an all-
out propaganda and terrorist campaign
on their comparatively prosperous and
incomparably better-governed neighbor,
Malaysia. This can have no right-
thinking person’s sympathy if his heart
and mind are in good working order.
Fortunately, the leaders of proven
democratic countries such as Britain,
Australia and New Zealand can see
through the smoke-screen being in-
creasingly generated in Djakarta, and
their moral support of Malaysia against
the completely unjustified calumnies
being perpetrated against them in the
name of Afro-Asian emergence is of
tremendous importance to Malaysia at
this critical stage of her growth as a
power for good in S-E Asia.

ROSS CAMPBELLS OXFORD
Sir,
One must sympathise with Mr Ross
Campbell's criticisms of Oxford in the
19305. It is only too true, alas, that “one
rarely hears of an Oxonian who has made
astute take-over deals or cornered scrap
metal or otherwise got into the big
money”. The same goes for Cambridge
too, 1 believe. However, we in Australia
can, I am sure, congratulate ourselves
that our universities try to do better. As
far as they can, they serve the needs of
industry, technology, commerce, and the
other nobler forms of human endeavor;

at least they do their best to ensure that
“education” does mean, primarily, “train-
ing for a profitable job”. To deepen
and enrich a student’s mind, to make
him critically aware of himself and of the
society he lives in, to help him under-
stand his relationships with the past, to
encourage him to realise other (perhaps
finer) possibilities of life than those read-
ily available to him today—such purely
“intellectual” stuff as this must, of course,
take second place. And with so clear a
conception of what is “worthwhile”, who
can avoid doubting, as Mr Campbell has
been led to doubt, whether in the end
English is a “worthwhile major subject
for university study”?
But perhaps it is unfair to be ironical,
for there is another side to Mr Campbell's
criticisms of English as a “subject”. As
he suffered it—and as many thousands
still do, at school or university—it is,
one must confess, a waste of time, a
barren, formal, purely “academic” grind
that undermines the very thing it sup-
poses itself to be serving. When Mr
Campbell complains that the English
course at Oxford was among “the least
stimulating to mental exertion”, one can
only agree, and wonder what he expected
from it. What enlivening mental exertion
could there be in culling textual variants,
in loading the memory with facts and
views about literature? For that matter,
what value is there in learning up the
“plots” and “characters” of novels or of
Shakespeare's plays; in analysing poetry
into “themes'’, “images”, “diction”, and
other pseudo-entities; in learning to “ap-
preciate” whatever is put before one as
conventionally accepted; or in trying to
take trivialities like “The Essay” or “The
Epic Tradition” seriously? The study of
English conceived in such terms as this
not only is valueless but inevitably comes
to be felt as valueless, and by students
and teachers alike—even by those of
them who pay superstitious reverence to
“Literature” or “Literary Values”, but
whose handling of it shows only too
clearly that they have no specific notion
of why, or of how, literature matters to
us, and matters vitally, now and here.
One can only assert that there is no need
to conceive English in the way it was
conceived at Oxford, and is conceived
by many besides Mr Campbell today—
as a “subject”, an inert body of acade-
mic “knowledge” to be mugged up and
veneered over with stylish displays of
“appreciation” or “opinions”: no need to
conceive it so, and every need to con-
ceive it differently.
Those people who see more in the
study of English than that won't perhaps
share much of Mr Campbell's admira-
tion for his Oxford tutor, C. S. Lewis,
who in fact did not see more in it than
that. It is understandable enough that
Lewis's breezy, superficially personal
academicism should have seemed more
impressive and “original” than the
merely dull academicism of his col-
leagues, and have effectively disguised
the fundamental crudeness of his mind
(“then the Renaissance came and spoiled
everything”) and conventionality of his
tastes. Nevertheless, it would be a pity
to suppose that Mr Campbell’s Oxford,
of C. S. Lewis, represents the highest
kind of personal discipline English can
offer, or the highest value of its study
at a university. As Mr Campbell sug-
gests so tellingly in his evocative por-
trayal of Oxford as he knew it, the real
enemy of mind—indeed, the real enemy
of all the humane values a university
should foster—may well be the bright,
“sophisticated” deadness inside the aca-
demic walls more than the active incom-
prehension outside them.

DUNTROON
Sir,
In your article on Duntroon (6/6/64)
you refer to “one general's” opinion,
that “Sandhurst produces a graduate of
the most exquisite manners and the most
barbarous ignorance”. It makes me
wonder what Duntroon produces when
its commandant is reported as saying
that the RMC has a cadet with a truck-
driver father and barmaid mother and
“a very good cadet he is, too”.

“THE CRUCIBLE”
Sir,
The executive of the Australian Na-
tional University Labor Club has asked
me to forward the following statement
which, in view of your article headed
“Red Universities” (13/6/64), we
would be glad if you would publish:
At a meeting of the Labor Club execu-
tive on June 8, the following resolutions
were passed:
1. The Labor Club does not recognise
that the latest issue of “The Crucible”
was produced under the auspices of the
club on the grounds that the manner of
publication was contrary to established
editorial practice. The publication .of
the article “What Goes On in the Aus-
tralian Society for the Study of Labor
History” was authorised by only one of
the two editors of “The Crucible” ap-
pointed by the club, namely Mr Harney.
The journal is therefore not to be re-
garded as a bona-fide edition of “The
Crucible”.
2. The Labor Club of the ANU en-
courages controversial and stimulating
discussion in “The Crucible” and it
wishes to stress that “The Crucible” is;
an independent journal and that the club
in no way desires to direct its editorial
policy. It refuses, however, to condone
such character sniping and unethical
journalism as appeared in the above-men-
tioned article.
3. The Labor Club therefore disso-
ciates itself entirely from this purported
edition of “The Crucible.”

The importance of Mortgage Protection
Like most people, you have probably arranged a mortgage
to finance the ownership of your home, and have arranged
to pay it off from future earnings over ten, fifteen or more
years.
There is, of course, no problem so long as you can continue
your repayments. But what if you were no longer here? If
death were to strike too early? Could your wife take up the
obligation without hardship?
You have, no doubt, protected your home with fire insurance,
and almost certainly you have taken out a life assurance
policy to provide for your family’s financial security.
These are not always enough.
If your wife should be left with the responsibility of your
new home and its mortgage, she would indeed be helped by
those other safeguards in the way of assurance, savings or
stocks and shares. But she would need them for the
children’s education, and for security in later years. They
would probably not cover the mortgage repayments as well.
There is an inexpensive—extremely valuable—answer:
CUSTOMLIFE PLANNED MORTGAGE PROTECTION POLICY.
This plan costs little, and is best explained by example:
A man, 34 years of age, is committed to repay, say, £2O per
month for the next 20 years—a total of £4,800 over the
period.
He could cover this responsibility by taking out a £1,200
Mortgage Protection Plan, with payments of a monthly
premium of only £3.8.0.
Benefits:
Should he die within the period of 20 years, his widow would
receive the following immediate payments during the years as
listed, and this amount would always cover the reducing
mortgage.
15th Year—£2,2Bo
16th Year—£2,loo
17th Year—£l,92o
18th Year—£l,74o
19th Year—£l,s6o
20th Year—£l,3Bo
Thus, at the end of 20 years, when the mortgage is cleared,
the Sum Assured would still be £1,200, plus all bonuses added
over the period. This policy then continues as a Whole of
Life Policy and the premium is then reduced to £2.15.0 per
month.
Customlife Mortgage Protection Plan can be varied to meet
your particular needs. Contact us to have one of our quali-
fied consultants call to discuss it with you.

THE JEWS IN AUSTRALIA
Sir,
Had Mr Sam Lipski’s article on “The
Jews in Australia” (20/6/64) restricted
its compass to observable phenomena
it might have been a piece of reportage
which could fairly have borne the
editorial comment, “The Australian
Jewish Community and how it sees its
role in the national life”. However, in
offering barely - polysyllabic judgments
(“contradictory”, “ritualistic”) on an
ancient tradition, Mr Lipski has demon-
strated an excessively subjective treat-
ment of his material that necessitates a
change to “. . . the Australian Jewish
community as Sam Lipski sees its role
in the national life”.
In his attempt to base his personal
judgments upon the distinctive features
of an immigrant Australian Jewry, in
juxtaposition with “. . . the greater
Australian environment” (by which is
meant, presumably, the greater Aus-
tralian community), Mr Lipski has failed
to recognise that. Australian society is
an immigrant society. Australia’s popu-
lation is composed of a series of
minorities, each one exhibiting “. . . the
grotesqueries of an immigrant minority
community in a state of flux”. The
grotesqueries, the “unwalled ghetto” and
all “alien” idiosyncracies are common-
place in this burgeoning community,
finding parallels in every Australian
region, city, town and street, from
Sydney’s Dixon Street to the “German
colony” of South Australia. In other
words, Mr Lipski has demonstrated
what he has not stated explicitly, that
Australia’s Jews are normal people,
subject to the same stresses and strains
of adjustment to a new environment as
other immigrants.
The search for firm lines of “grotes-
query” with which to compare the Jew
and his “Australian” neighbor, apart
from differences inherent in varied
religious beliefs and practices, has led
Mr Lipski to perpetrate some astonish-
ing banalities: the least of these is his
inference that the considered choice of
friends, clubs and social relationships is
a particularly Jewish attitude.
A more serious banality and a flaw
in reasoning is the statement that “Mel-
bourne Jews typify Australian Jews,
pushed and pushing themselves to
extremes”. In view of his subsequent
paragraph, and in face of the population
statistics presented in a preceding para-
graph, Mr Lipski can only mean that
Melbourne Jews typify Melbourne Jews.
Even were any person or group of
persons typical of others a doubtful
proposition—a more objective observa-
tion would have been that Melbourne
Jews, like most migrant minorities, work
very hard.
One must admit that Mr Lipski has
marshalled the evidence for a deep-
seated religious cleavage in Jewry
capably; he has noted in addition the
social affinity of Jew for Jew; yet he
has fallen into the common error of
equating social affinity with sociological
homogeneity. An article purporting to
discuss “The Christian in Australia”
would be all but meaningless in view of
the variety of Christian belief, and the
differences in environmental attitude
between rich and poor, educated and
illiterate, the recent migrant and the
descendants of the beneficiaries of the'
first assisted passage schemes (albeit un-
willingly). Does Mr Lipski seriously
maintain that there is a Jewish corm
munity in Australia any more sociologic-i
ally homogeneous than the Christian
community?
In toto it appears that Mr Lipski has
fallen victim to his own philo-Semitic/
anti-Semitic syndrome as shown by his
regurgitation of cliches of doubtful
validity such as the Jewish “edifice
complex” and Jewish brilliance.

THE ASLP CONFERENCE
Sir,
Your report of the Australian Student
Labor Federation conference (20/6/64),
while accurate in most respects, wrongly
credits me with “organising against the
present executive” of the Melbourne
University ALP Club on the grounds that
it is a tool of Dr Knopfelmacher. As
this continues a myth which started to be
spread while 1 was still absent in Eng-
land I would ask the courtesy of your
columns to state my position.
As a university lecturer in political
science, a member of the ALP and a'
former official of student socialist clubs
at my own university, 1 have naturally
been interested in the ALP Club since I
came to Melbourne in 1957. However,
1 am quite content to leave its executives
to decide their own course of action,
whatever I may say about such courses in
private conversation. At present the
Melbourne club is in a state of confusion
greater than at any time since I have been
associated with it, and important defec-
tions have occurred in the past month.
I regret the situation, but feel it inappro-
priate for me, or other members of staff,
to take more than a general interest in
what is going on.
Last year, it is true, I publicly advised
the club about the dangers of political
association with Dr Knopfelmacher.
Many interpretations, mostly uncharit-
able, have been put on this action. It
was taken only because of representa-
tions made to me by a number of club
members, who felt that only a staff mem-
ber could cope with a fellow academic.
It seemed to me then, as now, that
someone who habitually praises the
National Civic Council, Sir Wilfred Kent
Hughes, Mr B. A. Santamaria and other
well-known opponents of the ALP should
not, in all conscience, continue to exploit
the name and support of the “ALP” club.
Perhaps it would have been more appro-
priate for such a decision to have been
taken without the participation of staff
members. I for one have no intention
of involving myself in “take-overs” of
student organisations, if only because it
is so terribly easy and so terribly point-
less.

National Notebook
See You Later, Alligator
Students from the University of NSW
last week smuggled an alligator
from its cage at Taronga Park Zoo and
dumped it on the shores of a pond at
the University. Kidnapping of the reptile
was prompted by a “Beware of the
Crocodile” sign that appeared near the
pond several days earlier. This notice
had been removed from a local reservoir.
The two students who organised the
stunt said they had made a preliminary
reconnoitre of the Zoo to determine
how to capture the reptile and how to
escape without arousing suspicion.
During their visit the pair chatted with
a friendly zookeeper who answered
their queries on how to catch an
alligator, and what to do if they attack
you?
Next day, 80 students posing as a
zoology excursion class from (their
rival) Sydney University,
clustered about the cage
to hear a lecture from an
Arts student on the alli-
gator’s mating habits.
Meanwhile, hidden
from public view, the two
kidnappers scaled the wire
fence, lassoed the reptile, and wrapped it
in a tarpaulin. It took four students,
shielded by the rest of the group, to
lumber the 1401 b, six-foot alligator out-
side to a get-away car.
After its brief sun-baking spell beside
the pond, the alligator was collected by
Zoo officials. “It took four telephone
calls to convince them we had actually
swiped it,” said one conspirator, “and
even when the zookeeper arrived, he
was still sceptical. He thought it was
someone’s pet crocodile.”
Although Sir Edward Hallstrom,
honorary life director of the Zoo, said
the animal was “none the worse for its
experience”, the two assailants are
suffering from tick bites.
Members of the University administra-
tion were not amused by the prank. Said
one, “next time they could steal a tiger”.
Detectives were spotted at the Uni-
versity the following day. They repri-
manded the gatekeeper for his failure to
report the arrival of stolen property.
Electioneering
who are interested in cute little
electioneering gimmicks can learn
from the Victorian State elections. Any
number of candidates have put out cards
with pictures of themselves on one side,
with the complete VFL footy fixture list
on the other ... a sure vote-winner in
Melbourne. Another went further and
supplied a complete decimal currency
table, a useful guide, no doubt, for
converting election promises into dollars.
Another candidate put out his election
bills all over town in a red envelope,
just like an urgent telegram. The
temptation to open was irresistible.
But the most heart-warming gimmick
of all came from a candidate at Haw-
thorn. He lined up some good Liberal
boxers, border collies and dachshunds,
put jackets on their backs and paraded
them around Hawthorn bearing his
election posters.
Painting Prodigy
painter Senaka Senanayake
isn't sure whether he wants to make
his name as an artist or a cricketer. This
snippet of information came our way
from Tea Bureau man Abeyagunawar-
dena, whose organisation is sponsoring an
Australia - wide exhibition
of Senanayake’s works.
“Of course the artist is
only 12,” he told us,
“there’s plenty of time for
him to decide.”
We were given a pre-
view of the boy’s paint-
ings in the stock-room of Anthony
Hordern’s Sydney store. Looking at the
riot of color, the fluidity of line and sense
of composition, it was difficult to view
the work as child art.
“An amazing case of artistic precocity
. . . there is no easy explanation of such
talent—of what is really something of a
mystery,” commented Sir Herbert Read
when the work went on display in
London.
The Buddhist priests of Ceylon explain
it as a graphic example of reincarnation.
“The overpowering talents of this 12-
year-old boy are due to his being the re-
embodied spirit of one of the world's
great painters,” one of them asserted.
The one-man show, which will go to
Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane
and Perth after the Sydney opening on
July 6, includes early works painted when
the boy was seven.
These are paintings of animals, devil
dancers and his other love, cricketers.
Good child art showing promise, might
be the summing up.

total of £345 for world rights to a story
which a writer might be able to
originate and carry through all stages
to the final shooting script.
Without commenting on that offer,
we would like to detail the experience
of a friend of ours who is an occasional
writer. One of his stories
which took four weeks to complete was
sold in Australia for £l5. Later he
received a £2 2s. cheque for the story’s
inclusion in an Australian anthology.
And still later he received a letter from
the publisher stating that an inter-
national magazine wanted to reprint the
story “for the handsome fee of 50
dollars”.
From that figure he would lose 15
dollars in US Foreign Authors’ Tax
and a further three to five dollars for
the local publisher’s 10 per cent, as his
agent. His total net for the story would
reach the magnificent sum of £3l 5s. —
a few pounds more than the £25 tele-
vision offered for world rights to a story
line, which can be merely an outlined
idea in a page or two. There must be a
moral in it somewhere.

DAY”, continuing in smaller print, “The
Royal Military College, Duntroon, is
99
After a brief rundown on the purpose
and status of Duntroon, the Army then
claimed that “for 50 years graduates of
Duntroon have been numbered among
our great men. Today, as Australia grows
dramatically in world importance, the
Duntroon graduate joins the chosen
few for whom ambition and ability
know no human boundary.”
This, if the Army will pardon us, is
purest bunkum. A very small number
of the notable men in Australia’s past
50 years have been Duntroon graduates.
The idea of Australia’s future leaders
coming in any large numbers from the
ranks of Duntroon graduates, the chosen
few, etc., is one calculated to dismay
many more people than it is likely to
inspire.
We can only suggest that the Adjutant-
General kill the advertisement, quickly,
and hire a less flamboyant and more
factual copywriter.

PLAIN ENGLISH
The War in Borneo
ANYBODY who read Dennis
Bloodworth’s cool appraisal of
“The War in Borneo” in last week’s
“Bulletin” must have been struck
by both its candor and note of
underlying pessimism. The war in
Borneo is now a major little war
and could continue a long time,
which must raise doubts as to
whether Sabah, and Sarawak in
particular, could stand politically
firm against Indonesian pressure
in addition to the subversive activi-
ties of the clandestine Sarawak
Communist Party which, it is
estimated, can put 4000 guerrillas
into action if armed.
The Indonesians are estimated
to have 4000 troops on their side
of the border in Borneo and there
are fearful, if unconfirmed, reports
that there are 4000 Indonesian
irregulars in Sabah and Sarawak.
The British, according to Mr
Bloodworth, gloomily recall that
it required 12 years and 23 bat-
talions to put down the Emergency
in Malaya, and he reports some re-
sponsible British officers as saying
that the Borneo war could last 10
years with costs running into nine
figures.
In some respects undue appre-
hensions which this sort of thinking
arouses are absurd. Despite the un-
specific promises of Russian aid
made in Djakarta by the ebullient
Mr Mikoyan, the fact remains that
Indonesia’s military strength is
largely on paper. As an article on
page 27 of this issue points out,
Indonesia has a large army
almost as large as the armies of
Thailand, Burma and the Philip-
pines combined—a large proportion
of which is taken up in administrative
duties and which has no strategic
reserve in the accepted sense. The
Air Force is an oddly assorted col-
lection of aircraft bought, at differ-
ent times, from the Soviet and the
US. The Navy is not renowned for
efficiency, and its Sverdlovsk-type
cruiser, Irian, has just returned
from lengthy maintenancing in
Vladivostok. In addition to all this,
Indonesia has next to no industrial
capacity and its severely overtaxed
supply lines to the Borneo border
lie through inhospitable country.
Nevertheless in the context of
South-East Asia Indonesia remains
a formidable military power oppos-
ed to the peaceful existence of its
nearest neighbor. Mr Bloodworth’s
despatch leads to consideration of
three alternatives. If the war is to
remain purely defensive—“since
that means we can never win, all we
can do is to lose as slowly as pos-
sible,” said a British officer—there
is every chance Malaysia will lose it.
Indonesian armed aggression and
relentless internal subversive pres-
sures will probably see to that. If
the war is to become offensive it
would be relatively simple to defeat
Indonesia militarily. This means
crossing the border. But who
crosses it? British troops? Gurkhas?
Australians? There are obvious
dangers in this and Malaysia has
neither the manpower nor resources
to provide an army of its own for
some time to come. The third al-
ternative is a political settlement
which is urgently required. While
the Philippines still valiantly strug-
gles to get Malaysia to attend yet
another Foreign Ministers’ confer-
ence (at which Indonesia can con-
fidently be expected to behave with
its customary blend of arrogance
and blackmail), there may now be
a case for Malaysia referring the
dispute to the United Nations.
There have been good reasons for
not doing this in the past but in
the wider context of a long and
costly struggle or of a sudden ex-
tended conflagration, in which
Malaysia might prove a loser no
less than Indonesia, there is prob-
ably a good case for Kuala Lumpur
considering it now.
Anglicans and State Aid
HTHE almost unanimous decision
-*■ of Brisbane’s Anglican Synod
in favor of accepting Federal Gov-
ernment aid on science teaching in
schools is a heartening sign from
a city and a diocese that has fre-
quently led the way in promoting
genuine fraternity among the
churches.
Those Anglicans throughout Aus-
tralia who remain implacably op-
posed to the already accomplished
fact of the Government’s decision
because it might help mitigate the
problems facing Roman Catholic
schools and parents might well
ponder that they face the same
problems themselves. The Brisbane
Diocesan Registrar, Mr R. T. St
John, was undoubtedly pondering
this very fact when he urged that
Brisbane Synod should “forget
about the Roman Catholics” and
decide what the Church of Eng-
land wanted. This was sound ad-
vice and the vote in Synod showed
that practically everyone was think-
ing the same way. There are many
people in this country who oppose
State Aid as a matter of prin-
ciple and their position must be
respected. Among their numbers
may be included many Anglicans.
However, it is equally true to say
that many Anglicans have opposed
State Aid not because it violated
any principle of conscience but be-
cause it helped Roman Catholics.
Brisbane’s Anglican Archbishop
Strong had something to say about
that, too, when he said “it is diffi-
cult to see how the controversy
stirred up by ‘The Anglican’
(newspaper) can do anything to
advance the Kingdom of God”.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Menzies in Washington
Reassurances all round ...
FROM ALAN REID IN WASHINGTON
SIR ROBERT
Happy
A ustralia has gained considerable pre-
with the Johnson Administration,
pathetically disproportionate to the scale
of recently announced additional Aus-
tralian aid in South Vietnam in the shape
of 60 instead of 30 military instructors
and a small RAAF transport group. Aus-
tralians here say that official Washington
reacted as though at long last it had
found somebody who loved the US for
itself alone and not from pure self
interest.
Menzies (who may have played to
get precisely this US reaction from the
timing of the Australian announcement
of a token backing for the stiffening US
policy in the South-East Asia area) got
the benefit of strong pro-Australian feel-
ing by putting Australia's views about,
and fears of, possibilities in the area
before Johnson and Rusk.
Shrewdly exploiting American desires
to be loved for themselves alone and not
for their handouts, Menzies told a White
House luncheon: “It is a good thing to
have friends who are not going to resort
to questioning when the day of trial
comes but who will be there”.
It was against this background of
proven reliability as an ally, small but
prepared to take large risks in support-
ing US policy in South-East Asia, that
Menzies underlined the necessity for the
US to continue to adhere to its interpre-
tation that ANZUS comprehended
Malaysia where Australia had under-
taken commitments in which the US
does not formally participate.
Menzies, who does not appear to be
seeking any personal as distinct from
national publicity from his Washington
talks, was happy and smiling when he
emerged from his long session with
Rusk with whom he went into detail of
matters already discussed broadly with
Lyndon Johnson.
Menzies was perceptibly uneasy be-
fore seeing Johnson and obviously won-
dered whether Australian interests had
suffered from the death of Kennedy in
whose continuing personal interest in
South-East Asian problems—and those
of Australia Menzies had the fullest
confidence.
As a President early in his term is
liable to be influenced by theoreticians
rather than day-to-day advisers, more
deeply concerned with practical politics,
Menzies probably feared there could be
changes of emphasis in Administration
policy which could affect Australia
adversely.
Johnson and Menzies are both
essentially political pros who speak the
same language although their accents
differ. Johnson engagingly drops his
Texas drawl when officiating at State
functions as when last Wednesday he
conferred a military decoration on
General Paul Harkins, retiring US
Military Chief in South Vietnam, and
paid a politician’s wry tribute to the
performance of a fellow pro at the
White House luncheon.
He pointed out Menzies had been in
office for 15 years. “The Prime Minister
obviously has much to teach elective
officials in America,” he said.
Menzies was obviously pleased by
the compliments and reassured by his
talks with Johnson and Rusk particularly
as regards Australian commitments in
Malaysia, From what appears to have
transpired at the talks he had every
reason to be. At all events they have
had a tonic effect on him and his health
appears to have bucked up considerably.
WHITE AUSTRALIA
The Bogus Marriage Racket
When is a migrant’s wife a wife?
FROM JOHN WEBB IN CANBERRA
year about 300 Australian
women marry Asians granted only
temporary residence in Australia. An
undetermined percentage of these marri-
ages literally form marriages of con-
venience; the Asian has bought his bride
in an attempt to worm his way around
Australia’s immigration laws. However,
marrying an Australian does not give him
automatic permanent residence. Techni-
cally he is still here on his temporary
permit but the marriage considerably
strengthens his case when he applies for
. . , ~ , ,
permanent residence—provided the De-
. , r T T , j
partment of Immigration does not un-
f * 4.u * •* • • r
cover the tact that it is a marriage of con-
venience. Ma Yui Bin was shipped out to
Hong Kong after the Department nailed
him on a charge that he misled an officer
by saying he was living with his wife.
The case of the 41-year-old Chinese
cook and his unfortunate wife, Lois,
came to light when Immigration officers
started investigating what is now almost
a regular pattern for these marriages of
convenience.
Most of these marriages involve
students, businessmen or tourists, mainly
from Hong Kong although other Asians
are involved, who reach Australia on
temporary permits or virtually under
false pretences. In the case of the stu-
dents (fortunately only a relatively tiny
proportion of the 12,000 Asians studying
here each year) the mantle of scholar-
*s 9 u j discarded. All pretence

equally good at fabrication,
J
Before issuing a visa overseas the Aus-
tralian representatives on the spot ask in
Asia for evidence of a wife, children and
assets to see if he has something to go
back to. Tourists and businessmen from
Hong Kong sprouted wives and children
as if by magic. Until the regulations were
tightened up Immigration officials found
that Asians instructed to pack their bags,
or even under notice of deportation,
developed a sudden feeling for matri-
mony, produced marriage certificates
and requested permanent residence.


Ma was a typical case. Before leaving
Hong Kong and again on arrival in Aus-
tralia he declared he had a wife in main-
land China but no children. When offi-
cials checked through his file after the
marriage to Lois (to celebrate which Ma,
of course, had to declare himself single),
they found that an application for an
extension made by another Chinese on
Ma's behalf claimed that Ma was the
proud father of five children.
, . , . A .
Ma who arrived in Australia as a
’., . ,
tourist in February, 1961, was married
to Lois in June, 1963, and deported on
June 20 last. The case was typical. Wife
Lois revealed that other girls had also
been offered money to marry Chinese
they did not know, which confirmed the
Immigration Department’s fear that at
least some of these marriages are the
work of an organisation. The Common-
wealth Police Force has now joined
Immigration's teams in trying to put
together a case against men believed to
be involved in the marriage racket.
Finding them is not enough. Common-
wealth legal experts are going over Com-
monwealth law to see what charges the
Government could prefer against mem-
bers of the marriage racket and those
who participate in bogus marriages. They
are taking a hard look at American law
which provides that the arrangers and
partners to a marriage of convenience
may be guilty of an indictable offence.
The marriage racket is not confined to
Asians. Ships’ deserters or stowaways
often surrender to the authorities with
marriage certificates in their pockets. The
Immigration Department has a big pro-
blem trying to catch offenders and punish
them while being careful to avoid
victimising innocent people or those
who have married out of love and
genuine regard.
ART
The Great Melbourne Art Robbery
Time of the assessors
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
Tl/felbourne's great art robbery has
the critics and connois-
seurs just as much as the police. The
nine paintings were stolen from the
Toorak home of Mr Allan O. Martin, a
director of Metropolitan Dairies Ltd,
soon after they had been on exhibition
at the Chadstone shopping centre. The
thieves obtained entry by removing a
pane of glass and then neatly took the
canvases from their frames.
The thieves had a choice of 38 paint-
ings and they, no doubt, had a copy of
the catalogue of the Chadstone exhibi-
tion to guide them in their selection. The
nine they took included the five with the
highest valuations in the catalogue—
Rubens’ “The Tribute Money” (£60,000),
Murillo's “Immaculate Conception”
(£50,000), Van Dyck's “The Entomb-
ment” (£40,000), El Greco's “Magda-
lena” (£30,000) and Parmegianino’s
“Danae” (£20,000). They passed over
the next most valued painting, Vermeer s
“Magdalene" (£13,000) and several in the
£4OOO to £6OOO range and went for
cheaper items, including De Ribera’s
“Portait of Judas” valued at a mere
£5OO.
"C'rom the start, Melbourne newspapers
-*■ were careful to place the responsibility
for the claim that the paintings are
masterpieces valued at £168,500 squarely
on Mr Martin and have, as it were, not
endorsed this valuation themselves. Art
critics who have seen the paintings are
by no means certain that they are as
valuable as all that. “The Herald” art
critic Alan McCulloch said he was
doubtful if the paintings were originals.
“1 have never heard of these paintings,
as originals, being in Australia," he said.
“Art authorities overseas would have
known of their whereabouts if they were
originals,” he added. Dr Ursula Hoff,
keeper of prints at the Victorian National
Gallery, who inspected the collection
some years ago said, “They are very old,
but not necessarily of great importance.”
The gallery’s director, Mr Eric West-
brook, was very sharp, “As far as the
gallery is concerned, this collection was
not of the quality we would have con-
sidered for our collection.” Mr Archi-
bald Meare, a Toorak antique dealer,
stated that none of the pictures was
worth more than £2OO on today’s market.
Mr Meare had seen the collection about
eight years ago when he valued it for
probate purposes at £1477 10s. He said
he had sent three paintings and photo-
graphs of the rest of the collection to
London for appraisal by experts and they
had reported that they were “just nice
old paintings”.
Mr Martin said he had bought the
collection two years ago and freely ad-
mitted that, while some had doubts about
the paintings being originals, “I have no
doubts”. He said the stolen paintings
were insured for £168,500 through
Harvey Trinder Pty Ltd, insurance bro-
kers. The firm’s manager, Mr J. H.
Burton, said that art thefts were common
in Europe, and his firm would adopt the
normal procedure of appointing an
assessor.
The collection was formed by the late
Mr Linneas Roberts and after his death
in 1956 passed to his widow who sold
it to Mr Martin. Mr Roberts started col-
lecting at an early age late last century
and at the time of his death claimed to
have £300,000 of paintings, and Dyna-
sty bronzes, Ming pottery and other
objets cl'art. According to the Chad-
stone catalogue, Mr Roberts worked on
the assumption that important works
“MUST” have been brought to Australia
by the early settlers, in some cases “as
capital by black sheep” and were then
bartered into ignorant hands in the tur-
bulent gold rush days. With this belief,
Mr Roberts haunted second-hand shops
and once admitted that he rarely paid
more than £5 or £lO for a piece.
Painter Noel Counihan, who knew
Roberts, confirmed this. He spoke of
him as “a dedicated collector and a
modest, quiet man who was not rich”
and who had at one time worked as a
window dresser.
“I think he discovered, perhaps not
genuine masterpieces, but paintings done
in the 16th or 17th century.”
There were others, however, who were
quite certain that the paintings were all
they were claimed to be. One was Miss
Margaret Mac Kean, a gallery assistant
at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art
Gallery in Launceston. Miss Mac Kean
holds two diplomas in art and design
from the London University and spent
three months in 1962-63 compiling a
catalogue for Mr Martin.
Mr F. Benko, a Moonee Ponds art
restorer, who had worked on the collec-
tion also believed the works were
genuine, and so did Mr Frank Carter,
Director of the Prahran Technical
School’s Art Centre.
As the battle raged between the ex-
perts and with the insurance assessor
waiting to see him, Mr Martin said he
was “fed up to the teeth with Pressmen
questioning him” about the authenticity
and value of the paintings. “The art
world,” he said, “is a very cruel world.”

FROM A BRISBANE CORRESPONDENT
tTTiERE was no soul-searching by the
Brisbane Anglican Synod last week
over State Aid. The Synod decided after
hearing only two speakers to accept the
Federal Government’s special aid for

Australia over the State Aid issue, said
that he personally favored the aid, and
that it was vital to see that church
schools did not lag behind in science
teaching. Church schools, he said, could
teach science in an atmosphere of reli-
gion at a time when science was often
pitted against religion.
Earlier still, he had said in a diocesan
letter that it was difficult to see how
the controversy stirred up by the Sydney
weekly, “The Anglican”, over the matter
of Federal grants for science buildings
could do anything to advance the King-
dom of God.
At last week’s Brisbane Synod, one
cf the two speakers to the State Aid
motion, the Brisbane diocesan registrar
(Mr R. T. St. John) told the Synod it
should “forget about the Roman Cath-
olics” and decide what the Church of
England wanted. The other speaker,
the Rev. Dr Keith Ravner, rector of
Wynnum (a bayside suburb), said the
independent schools, which were dear
to the community and prevented “mono-
chrome education”, might be destroyed
without aid. The Queensland Method-
ists are expected to decide at their annual
State conference in October, and the
Presbyterians at their general assembly
next May.
COMMUNISTS
The Indonesian
Cold Shoulder
Australia follows the Italian line
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
M. AIDIT
Snub
Though Ted Hill and the Communist
Party of Australia (Marxist-Leni-
nist) came in for plenty of contempt at
the twentieth Congress of the Commu-
nist Party this month, the spectre of
China still loomed in the background.
It was freely admitted that, despite
comings and goings over the past few
months, there seemed no hope of
reconciliation with the pro-China NZCP.
In fact the NZ general secretary, Vic
Wilcox, ignored an invitation to attend
the Congress and sent a lesser light,
while setting out for Indonesia for talks
with leaders of the Indonesian Party
(PKI). For their part the Indonesians
refused to send any delegate to the Con-
gress and have invited Hill to come to
Indonesia.
Local tactics and manoeuvres apart,
it is obvious that the CPA is Khrush-
chev’s sofe outpost in the South-East
Asian area and that the newly elected
Central Committee will have their work
cut out to justify any hopes held for
them as Khrushchev’s conciliators in this
area.
The Indonesian refusal marked the
end of an era that began before, during
and after the war when Sharkey as an
executive member of the Communist
International bossed an area stretching
from Indonesia to New Zealand, as
Moscow's delegate.
Long before voting began to elect
the incoming Central Committee Laurie
Aarons’ bright young men were moving
amongst the interstate delegates, passing
the word that Laurie would not be a
candidate for the general secretary’s
position; the status quo was to be main-
tained, with Sharkey as secretary, R.
Dixon as president and Laurie vice-
president.
Sharkey had vacillated for months
before finally deciding whether to run
for office, and having done so it was
only a matter of course that his old
crony Dixon would go along with him.
Rather than run the risk of causing a
further split, Aarons let Sharkey have the
title while he settled for the power. He
went to the Congress with a tight grip
on the Party and left it with the organi-
sational apparatus completely tied to
him.
It had been planned to begin the Con-
gress with a gala opening session, but the
Federal Government had proved unco-
operative and refused visas to delegates
from USSR, Italy, Mongolia, India,
Cyprus and Ce»ylon. However, by making
do with Messrs Gollan (CP of Great
Britain), Buck (Canada) and Williams
(NZ) with Tass and Pravda representa-
tives, Yasnev and Kondrashov, standing
in for the absent Russians, the proposed
piece of window-dressing was held with
Sharkey reading a carefully prepared
United Front-type speech. Then behind
locked doors for three days the real
business of the Congress was transacted.
The general line which was adopted
without a dissenting voice could be sum-
med up in one phrase work through
front organisations; with the emphasis
on peace, youth, women, trade unions
and Aborigines. The United Front tac-
tic was a focal point in all speeches and
in its final form the Party line more
closely resembled that of the Italian CP
than any other.
The leading committee, the Secre-
tariat, shed the members who had been
co-opted in the recent difficult days and
reverted to four Sharkey, Dixon,
Aarons and C. Jones of Queensland (an
Aarons man). The empty seats on the
Central Committee went to Aarons men.
They likewise took the large majority of
positions on the Political Committee and
Jack Hughes was re-elected to the all-
important Disputes Committee.

“Then take this cake of tobacco and

LAW
A Poser for Federal Cabinet
Who succeeds Sir Kenneth Bailey?
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
An announcement out of Canberra in
the next few weeks will mark a
fundamental policy decision of the
Federal Government on the conduct of
its legal affairs and also the definitive
end of an era in the Attorney-General's
Department.
The question is who will replace Sir
Kenneth Hamilton Bailey, Solicitor-
General of the Commonwealth since
1946, who is to go to Canada as High
Commissioner. Sir Kenneth, knighted in
1958, received his final honor from the
Commonwealth last week when he was
made a silk, the first Commonwealth QC
ever appointed. (The first Common-
wealth Solicitor-General, the legendary
Sir Robert Garran, was a State silk.)
Sir Kenneth's career had been an in-
credibly varied one. Like the Prime
Minister, an old Wesley College, Mel-
bourne, man, he went on to Corpus at
Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar in 1918. He
became a master of Queen’s College in
the University of Melbourne in the
sylvan days of the between-the-wars Uni-
versity. But it was Dr Evatt who took
him from hie chair in Public Law at
Melbourne as an adviser to the war-
time Labor Government and ultimately
appointed him Solicitor-General and
Secretary to the Attorney-General’s De-
partment.
In that capacity as second law officer
of the Commonwealth, after the Attor-
ney-General, who as a parliamentarian
sits in Cabinet, Sir Kenneth was involved
in the classic legal battles of the late
’forties, but when the Menzies Govern-
ment came to power he remained in the
Department.
The question now is whether his re-
placement will be taken from the Bar
or whether he will come from the ranks
of the Attorney-General s Department.
In the relatively quiet days ot the
’fifties (except for the Anti-Communist
legislation) the role of the Solicitor-
General could remain an administrative
one.
But with the challenge facing the
Attorney-General’s Department, if it is
to continue to follow the path blazed by
Sir Garfield Barwick, the office of Soli-
citor-General must become more in-
volved with policy.
Quietly, earlier this year in Sir
Garfield Barwick's tir. . the offices of
Solicitor-General and Secretary to the
department were separated, which is be-
ing taken by those in the know as a clear
indication that the Solicitor-General's
office in the future may well be a matter
for appointment rather than promotion.
Some precedent for this exists in NSW
and in Victoria, where the Solicitor-
General is an appointed office.
UNIVERSITIES
Degrees on the Cheap?
Farmer Bolte against the “snobs"
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
HENRY BOLTE
Zeal
In the 1961 Victorian election, the
* Premier Mr Bolte promised that
Ballarat would have its own university.
In the election campaign which finished
last week Mr Bolte not only again
promised Ballarat university facilities
but said these would also be extended
to the senior technical colleges at Swin-
burne, Caulfield and Footscray in Mel-
bourne, and to the Gordon Institute of
Technology at Geelong and the Bendigo
Technical College. These technical
colleges, together with the Ballarat
School of Mines, would be granted
degree status, Mr Bolte said.
Their degree courses would be equal
te those of the two existing universities
and a central institute would be set up
to control the colleges and their courses.
The courses, said Mr Bolte, would be
longer than those of the existing
diploma courses in the technical colleges.
The degrees would be of a “somewhat
technological nature in addition to
architecture, textiles and possibly the
arts and humanities”,
“Undoubtedly there will be opposition
from some academics, but that will be
just on the ‘snob side’ of degrees. I do
not believe that only the major uni-
versifies should have the divine right to
grant degrees,” the Premier said.
From the universities, as such, there
has been no comment on Mr Bolte’s
proposals, nor was any likely until at
least after the electioneering dust had
settled. It was left to the secretary of
the Melbourne University Staff Associa-
tion, Mr K. G. Armstrong, to voice, in
restrained terms, the alarm felt in
academic circles at Mr Bolte’s announce-
ment. Speaking on behalf of the Monash,
as well as the Melbourne University
staff, Mr Armstrong said that university

teachers had been embarrassed by the
Premier making his announcement
during an election campaign. In this
situation, Mr Armstrong said, academic
teachers felt that any. criticism based on
their educational knowledge might be
regarded as a political move.
“On the other hand we feel that if
no comment is made on these proposals
our silence may be interpreted as blanket
approval,” Mr Armstrong added. He
went on to make a plea for the planning
of university expansion to be left to
experts rather than turned into an
election issue.
Mr Armstrong's most telling point,
however, was his statement that since
1963 the Victorian universities, under
their quota system, had excluded 375
from doing Arts courses, 433 from
Commerce and 222 from Law. By con-
tract, in the technical field, there had
been six exclusions from Science, three
from Engineering and none from Archi-
tecture.
In other words, the shortage of uni-
versity places was not in these courses
which Mr Bolte said the technical
colleges would first offer.
With the election over a lot more will
be heard from university teachers and
others who are concerned at the de-
preciation of Victorian degrees implied
in Mr Bolte’s proposals. Others, how-
ever, will be keeping their thoughts to
themselves and their fingers crossed in
the hope that this, too, may be just
another election promise. The frontal
public attack on the Bolte proposals
carries the danger that it may harden
the Premier into determined zeal to
carry his scheme forward without delay.
With caution, it may be passed over to
yet another committee of inquiry and
therein strangled.
THE WATERFRONT
Elliott’s Year
of Trial
“Thank God for Ampol”
FROM A BRISBANE CORRESPONDENT
Although Seamen’s Union elections
are not due until October manoeu-
vring has already begun. The focus is
on E. V. Elliott, Federal Secretary, who
if anything is now coming under more
criticism from members than when he
was so nearly toppled from his throne in
1962 by former Victorian Secretary and
long time opponent Bill Bird.
Faced by the contradiction of increas-
ed shipping tonnage on the Australian
coast on the one hand and a decreas-
ing number of jobs caused through
automation on the other, together
with the failure of the Union to obtain
a new award from the shipping com-
panies, Elliott must revert to pseudo-
militancy to retain his slippery hold on
office. This is a tactic he learned well
in 1962 when, faced with defeat by
Bird, he snatched victory only by virtue
of a massive campaign, waged around
the refusal to man the Ampol tanker
P. J. Adams with an Australian crew.
This highly publicised campaign had the
effect of uniting the membership behind
the sitting officials, so that when Elliott
was finally declared elected, Queensland
Secretary J. Fitzgerald exclaimed to the
Brisbane District Committee of the Com-
munist Party, “Thank God for Ampol”.
There is a growing criticism at stop-
work meetings and from the ships. In
the Union journal of March, 1964, sea-
man L. Sharpen writes of the low
morale and complains of the lack of
official action on the contentious 1960
award which seamen claimed worsened
their conditions. He says that when asked
for action officials would say, “What
about the ACTU? They will leave us
for dead”. “We can't afford it.” “What
about the Penal Clauses? They might
‘boob’ us.” Sharpen says that “members
become cynical and disillusioned and
officials aloof and complacent”.
There was some half-hearted refuta-
tion of Sharpen's criticism, then a com-
plete ship's crew (from the Iron Mon-
arch) backed it up with a letter demand-
ing action. Significantly, Sharpen is a
well known militant and the signatory
on behalf of the Iron Monarch’s crew
was K. Swift, a Communist.
Meanwhile, Elliott himself in an am-
biguous statement to seamen said: “Our
Union is trying to negotiate improved
wages and conditions for members and
the shipowners are being obstinate. Sea-
men have been offered shore jobs. They
have hesitated because of the negotia-
tions. The Union does not wish those
seamen to feel obligated to remain in
the industry now the shipowners are fail-
ing to improve conditions.”
In the same statement Eliiott delivered
the doubtful judgment that: “Shipowners
should realise that they cannot do with-
out seamen, but seamen can do without
shipowners.” It is especially doubtful at
a time when BHP have an application
before the Court to reduce the manning
of some of their ships from 18 seamen
to 10.
If Bill Bird or a man of similar calibre
nominates against him, Elliott will need
to deliver the goods between now and
October or he could well find himself
out of the job that gives him in the vicin-
ity of £2500 p.a. in pay and allowances,
plus frequent trips overseas, and allows
him to employ his wife as editor of the
Union journal.

Lysaght Red Orb Corrugated Steel Sheet
Why does Lysaght Steel Sheet have two lives?
Steel men call it “sacrificial protection.” It
starts when Lysaght Red Orb is coated with
a perfectly even deposit of zinc—l.7s ozs.
of zinc for each square foot of steel. This
combination of steel base and protective
zinc coating is normally good for a lifetime.
But accidents do happen. The life of any
sheet may be impaired by damage, but with
zinc coating the sheet’s second life then
starts. “Sacrificial protection” comes to the
rescue. The zinc coating corrodes locally
. . . but not the steel base.
It stays free of corrosion, with its strength
unimpaired. Call it “sacrificial protection.”
Call it “lifetime insurance.” Whatever you
call it, there is nothing more durable than
Lysaght Red Orb . . . and no better choice
for roofing and wall'cladding.
Stocks of this famous sheet are available
from galvanized steel sheet merchants, and

OUT AND ABOUT
Dean Dixon Comes Home
“A bit more for Beethoven "
By PATRICIA ROLFE
uy feel as if I have just arrived
I home,” Dean Dixon said. His
brilliant smile drew fugitive
smiles and happy foot-shuffles from the
group of Australian Broadcasting Com-
mission people waiting for the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra’s new musical
director at Mascot airport. The group
was small and the enthusiasm re-
strained compared with the 3000 Beatle
fans noisily saying good-bye to their
favorites on the other side of the tarmac,
but Mr Dixon seemed satisfied for the
moment to be back in Australia.
“He’s looking well,” someone from
the ABC said, and, indeed, Mr Dixon
would need to (although he has since
added a strained shoulder to the thumb
injury he was nursing when he arrived).
He has 33 concerts in three States
between June 24 and August 22. He
also obviously intends to do consider-
able preliminary work in preparation
for taking up his position with the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra, under a
three-year contract, next year. His wife,
the Finnish playwright Mary Mandelin,
will join him this week.
Although this year’s visit is only
something of a dry run for the job
ahead of him it should be long enough
for a man of Mr Dixon’s vigor and drive
to make exciting possibilities grow into
probabilities. Mr Dixon has heard, but
only as delightful rumor, that the
orchestra may go to Britain next year
for the first Commonwealth Festival of
the Arts.
His presence should in time disperse
the belief that he was chosen for the job
because someone in Canberra thought
an American Negro as conductor of the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra would be
good window-dressing for Australia in
Asia. It should soon be abundantly
clear that Mr Dixon is here because “the
boys” in the orchestra wanted “the
Dean”, and that many of them optimis-
tically believe that within the next few
years their orchestra will return to, or
eclipse, the days of its greatness, when
they had “the old man”, Sir Eugene
Goossens.
That is in the future. For the moment,
Mr Dixon’s claims for the orchestra are
modest, and his plans fluid, but his
reasons for coming back to Sydney are
clear.
“I am back here because I am happy
here and happy with the orchestra,” he
said. “I believe that the standard of the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra is exceed-
ingly high and that it is capable of great
growth. It wants to grow. That is the
important thing. So I believe it is
capable of becoming one of the great
international orchestras.”
It is obvious that the ABC got Mr
Dixon’s signature on a contract in the
nick of time. Since he was here in 1962
his stature has increased and his
schedule has grown even tighter. Mr
Dixon will keep his position as general
music director of the Hesse Radio
Symphony Orchestra in Frankfurt. He
will spend four to five months each year
in both Sydney and Frankfurt, but will
fit other concerts in between. He will go
to London later this year for further
concerts with the BBC Symphony
Orchestra. His annual holidays, he said,
would be “taken on the plane between
Sydney and Europe”.
In spite of Mr Dixon’s international
reputation as a conductor, he does not
believe that he will ever conduct in his
own country.
“I am booked up now until 1968,”
he said, “but I have still never had an
offer to conduct one concert in the
United States. Judson, the agent, has
told me that any time I get together a
Negro orchestra he can book me any-
where in America. But that is all. In
the meantime, any time a young
musician wants to go to Europe for
experience he tells them there are only
two conductors in Europe for them to
try to work under —Dean Dixon and
von Karajan. He sends people to me,
but he does not come to me himself.”
A marginal matter
All this is said in a quite matter-of-
fact way. Whatever sympathy Mr
Dixon feels for his people in the United
States, at the moment his color is for
him only a marginal matter. The sort of
choice of where they will live or work
which exists for Negro writers, artists,
even actors, does not exist for him,
simply because he must live where he
can work. The people in America who
suggested he should stick to jazz and
leave classical music alone, or that he
should wear white gloves when he con-
ducts, made his choice for him. The
thought of conducting a Negro orchestra,
not because it was Negro, but because
it might not contain the best available
players, will be enough to keep him
away from America.


“But,” as he said, “when you work in
the arts you have less time to think
about who you are, what people think
you are or what people think you should
be.” This does not seem to be a formula
answer he has learnt will ward off further
questions. It is simple truth.
Deeper and stronger
he was asked whether his stay in
" Australia was limited by our immi-
gration laws, rather than his availability,
he did not know the answer. “You’d have
to find that out from the ABC,” he
said.
Musically, he has no regrets about
leaving the United States. “The Euro-
pean tradition runs so much deeper and
stronger,” he said. “There is everything
I want there and here.”
Mr Dixon admitted that his orchestra
in Frankfurt was to some extent suffering
from the shortage of first-class players
which is afflicting many European
orchestras. “We are auditioning to fill
some vacancies this year,” he said. “I
believe the shortage in Europe comes
from the lack of good musical training.”
Mr Dixon said that the Hesse Radio
Symphony Orchestra, in common with
most European orchestras which re-
ceived Government help, offered players
a secure job and a pension. He agreed
there might be dangers in having players
who felt they had a job for life, but
thought that this was preferable to the
uncertainties of life for many British
orchestral players. He does not expect
that he will want to replace any members
of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and
then find that under the terms of their
employment he is not able to (although
he was uncertain of the detailed terms of
their employment). “People generally do
better than you expect,” he said confi-
dently.
Mr Dixon said his long-term aim with
the Sydney Symphony Orchestra would
be to “broaden and deepen its reach into
the classics in the Central European
tradition, into the long-hair, wild
moderns and to achieve a good position
with the classic moderns.”
He does not feel that because Aus-
tralia is spoken of as a “young country”
that there is any special affinity with
modern composers.
“The young aspect of the country
comes out mostly in the audience,” he
said. “It is a young public in the basic
sense of the word; that is, it is open
and available to new ideas.”
Mr Dixon said that his position as
musical director was partly an organisa-
tional one, and that his plans would have
to fit in with the plans—and budget—
of the ABC. However, it is certain that
he will make efforts in two directions —
towards finding new local conductors
and in work with young people.
Mr Dixon has already given con-
ducting courses in several European
countries. “We must see what talent we
have in that direction,” he said.
When he talks about young people he
really means young—down to four years
of age, an age group not yet en-
compassed by the ABC youth or school
programmes.
“The technique with children is par-
ticipation,” Mr Dixon said. “It is not
enough for them merely to listen. They
must be part of the orchestra. You can
achieve this by special use of rhythms,
by bringing out the character of the in-
struments, by teaching musical language
and form, by giving the audience some-
thing to do all the time.”
Mr Dixon said that his work with
children began in 1932. He had used
radio, television and recordings as well
as a live orchestra.
“It must be realised that music per se
has a relatively limited audience,” he
said. “It is an acquired taste like olives
or oysters. And people are cut off from
it because they feel they don’t know how
to dress for a concert, how to sit, and
how and when to applaud. But once
they are on first-name terms with the
orchestra then they have freedom of
choice. They can choose what sort of
music they like.
“I would not for one minute want to
destroy youth’s enthusiasm,” he added,
as enthusiastic young girls with purple
cardboard hearts, inscribed “I Love the
Beatles”, ran through the Overseas
Terminal, “but I think we can turn it
into different directions. I don’t object
to pop music. Some of my best friends
are pop musicians. But I think we can
take a bit away from the Beatles and
give it to Beethoven. We can get young
people away from a continual diet of
vanilla ice-cream and on to something
a bit more substantial.”

From the ABC
Dixon’s chances of success in
Sydney
By MARTIN LONG
Dean Dixon was appointed resi-
” dent conductor of the Sydney Sym-
phony Orchestra early last year the only
acquaintance that the orchestra and its
audience had had with him had been
through a relatively brief season of con-
certs in the last months of 1962
Dixon was more or less an unknown
quantity in Australia before that visit,
since he had built his reputation almost
entirely outside the English-speaking
countries.
The wholehearted and unanimous ap-
proval with which his appointment was
greeted was a striking indication of the
strong impact he made during his stay
here.
The dominant impression he left was
that of a musician possessed of great
strength and integrity, combined with
knowledge and technical equipment of a
high order.
Coming after the beautifully finished
performances directed by Van Otterloo
earlier in the same year, Dixon’s interpre-
tations occasionally seemed a little rough
in detail. One almost felt that he dis-
dained surface polish in his determination
to uncover the essential meaning and
structure of the music.
It was clear from the start that he was
not to be one of the balletic, showman-
like conductors. He is sparing of gesture
and at times even a little stiff and puppet-
like in his movements; but there is no-
thing stiff about the music he makes,
which is full of warmth and rhythmic
vitality—a vitality that courses not only
through the quick movements, but
through all the music, fast and slow,
soft or loud.
At his first Sydney concert in 1962
he ranged from an uncompromisingly
austere reading of Sibelius’ gaunt fourth
symphony to a warmly colorful account
of De Falla’s popular “Three-Cornered
Hat” dances. He showed a firm com-
mand of style at both ends of the spec-
trum.
In his second programme he clinched
the impression with a powerfully con-
vincing performance of the Beethoven
“Eroica” Symphony. After it I felt con-
fident enough to write of Dixon that “for
the breadth of his musical sympathies and
the sense of power and authority he con-
veys, few of the conductors who have
stood before this orchestra could match
him.”
A special series of three all-Mozart
concerts were a notable artistic—and box-
office —success.
I don't think there is any doubt that
Divon can revitalise orchestral music-
making in Sydney if he is given the
chance; the limiting factors are mainly
outside him. Among them: the need to
strengthen the orchestra in certain sec-
tions; the need to relieve it of a certain
amount of routine work (preferably
through the formation of a second
orchestra); the need of the ABC adminis-
trators to have an open mind about the
innovations that Mr Dixon evidently
envisages.

“When I travel I don’t want to waste time.
I can’t afford to. That’s why I flew Pan Am
on my last trip.”
—says Mr, Clare Higson of Sydney , President , A.S.E.M. Export Association.
“I like to see my overseas customers,
then get right back home to my office.
I need an airline that flies everywhere—
without unnecessary changes of plane
and wasted time. An airline with world-

As Mr. Higson found out, world-wide
connections make a world of difference
on a long business trip. Pan Am’s con-
venient schedule lets the busy executive
leave when he wants to, arrive when he
has to. The reason? Pan Am flies more

What Makes Hewat Run?
“No career for me after I'm 40”
From JAMES MURRAY in London
TI/hat happens to D-grade reporters on
the Melbourne “Age”? One would
assume that in the fullness of time they
would become C-grade reporters, then
perhaps B-grade. One of them, how-
ever, dragged himself clear in time to
break into British television. He is Tim
Hewat, whose bouncing telly-baby, born
January, 1963, by “March of Time” out
of the London “Daily Express”, makes its
30-minute demand upon 16 million
British viewers.
Hewat has now left the programme
and is planning new ventures. But it is
certain that no one trained in newspaper
work has made the transposition to tele-
vision documentary in Britain with the
force of Hewat. His impact is not
lessened by argument as to whether its
chief element is sheer personality or an
ability to put new verve into old bottles.
Hewat was born on May 4, 1928, in
Palmerston, New Zealand. His father,
a food exporter, brought him to Mel-
bourne in 1936, following the New Zea-
land Government’s decision to nationa-
lise his business. This, and Geelong
Grammar School, which he attended till
Christmas, 1945, may account for the
fact that Hewat labels himself a con-
servative. It was another socialised
farming experiment which helped to
bring Hewat to England. Sir Richard
Plummer, then in charge of the British
Labor Government’s ground-nuts scheme,
visited Melbourne, where he met Hewat’s
father. Plummer, a former executive
of Beaverbrook newspapers, suggested to
Hewat, who had by this time joined “The
Age”, that he should go to London to
work for the “Daily Express”.
With an introduction from Plummer,
Hewat, now a D-grade, worked his pass-
age to England to join the “Express” in
1948. With one break in Canada, where
he went to get married for the first time
and to work on the “Toronto Globe and
Mail” for a year, Hewat was with the
“Express” till May, 1957.
Not even Expressmen—even Express-
men in their cups—are glib enough to
analyse the effect that the “Express” and
Lord Beaverbrook have on those who
work there. Apart from its windmill tilt-
ing for the Empire, the newspaper is
noted for the Byzantine quality of its
office politics. (Six daggers for every
back and a dozen cloaks for every dag-
ger is almost the house motto.) Hewat
not only survived; he thrived, first as a
sub-editor. Then in 1951, the late Arthur
Christiansen sent him to Korea for six
months, telling him: “You're expendable.
Old men should not be sent on dangerous
jobs.”
Hewat was not expendable. Back in
London, he began to climb the ladders of
the “Express” (adroitly avoiding the
snakes). His promotions could not have
come more regularly had he been Lord
Beaverbrook's nephew: he moved up one
place every six months with the smooth-
ness of a 17-jewel clockwork, golden
boy. In November, 1956, he went to
take charge of the “Daily Express” nor-
thern editions, printed in Manchester.
What caused him to leave after 15
months? Myth has it that he decided to
leave on the very day it was made clear
to him that he would never be Editor of
the “Express”.
Hewat sees it differently: “The ‘Ex-
press’ is a young man’s newspaper. I
decided to get out because it seemed to
me that television offered better oppor-
tunities and a longer future.”
He recalls, too, a memorable exchange
with Lord Beaverbrook which may or
may not have clanged into the scales
against him:
“The Beaver asked me what I thought
of his book ‘Men and Power’. I said
that the only thing I had learned from
it was that Asquith was a bum. And I
knew that already.”
Tn May, 1957, on his 29th birthday,
Hewat joined Sidney Bernstein’s Gra-
nada television network in Manchester as
a trainee producer at one-third of his
“Express” salary.
His experience in newspapers, especi-
ally the pressures of his final 15 months
in Manchester, had stamped into him
certain professional hallmarks which
were not lost in television. His docu-
mentaries merely transpose to the box
newspaper techniques. Analysed, his
documentaries break down into televisual
headlines, intros, paragraphs, subheads
and facts, facts, facts. Always they
convey a feeling of great professional
dash. With his newspaper-conditioned
reflexes, Hewat is able, even in pro-
grammes which take ten times the pre-
paration of a newspaper, to appear
topical.
Hewat accepts that the necessity of
junking film is as much a part of cur-
rent events television as the necessity
of spiking reams of copy is a part of
newspapers. One show in five was scrub-
bed while he was in charge of “World
in Action”— each costs between £l5OO
and £6OOO.
The fact that Hewat is now able to
display such financial sangfroid in an
industry where accountants are fre-
quently kings must not be taken to mean
that he was an instant success. His earty
television work in Manchester he him-
self describes as “disastrous”. But Sid-
ney Bernstein, who has little else it
common with Lord Beaverbrook, shares
with him an instinct of giving people
enough hemp to make a tightrope—oi
to hang themselves—allowed him his
failures. Then Hewat took over pro-
duction of Granada’s “What the Papers
Say”, a televisual version of the late
A. J. Liebling's New Yorker feature “The
Wayward Press”.
1958 to 1960, Hewat produced
“Searchlight”. The programme took a
single subject each week—suicide, cruelty
to children, dirty food, road accidents—
and went after its subject with the eagei
directness of a ferret after a rabbit.
At this time, Hewat spent eight weeks
back in Australia, clearing up family
affairs, following the death of his first
wife. While he was in Australia he
got a cable from Granada asking him to
return to direct a TV variety show called
“Chelsea at Nine”. His first chore was
to get the American show business
veteran Tony Martin on the air.
He managed it only after hours of
frantic effort and countless repetitions of
the old formula it-will-be-all-right-on-the
night. After the show, Martin came tc
Hewat to offer him a job as his persona!
producer. “I have never been so weli
produced in my life,” he said. Hewat
refused the offer. “It was my best show
too. It was my first,” he replied.
For Hewat, 1960 was a vintage year,
He was awarded the British Producers'
Prize for Factual Presentation, following

In the same year, Hewat went to India
to make four films with Clive Donner,
He also went to Cuba—and into a Cuban
gaol for a spell. He got married—to
Anne Suudi, Granada's head of casting,
Despite his verbal swashbuckling (his
command of the great Australian adjec-
tive is of virtuoso flexibility), Hewat is
too much a professional questioner him-
self ever to be pinned down by queries
about his future. He is also, all 15
stone and 5 foot 10 inches of him, down
to the last freckle, a shy man, basically
withdrawn behind his raucous quills.
He makes it clear, however, that he
is not likely to return to Australia.
“In many ways I'd love to. But my
life is here now and my future.”
How he sees that future, what makes
Hewat run is best summed by his recall-
ing: “An accountant asked me what t
was going to do after I was 40. I said
‘You stupid bastard. There’s no careei
for me after I'm 40’.”
He could be wrong.

EXECUTION
A SHORT STORY BY INDONESIAN WRITER NUGROHO NOTOSUSANTO
Translated by Glenda Felton
The five of us wait in front of dis-
trict headquarters. The field mili-
tary court had pronounced the
verdict on the leader of a gang of rob-
bers who had lately been stirring up
our area with their lootings and killings.
Their activities had interfered with our
defence which was already standing up
with difficulty against the troops of the
strong Dutch 7 December Division. In
the end, the military police section which
operates in our district arrested him and
his key men. Then he was tried. He
got the heaviest sentence. His execution
is today. We of the Algodjo unit are the
executioners. Our commandant had not
wanted to pick out the ones who were to
get that horrible job. He had asked for
volunteers. Other units had refused.
Our unit was left. I with my seventeen
years was quick to volunteer. It would
add to my experiences, I thought. Then
my friends wanted to as well. But
only five men are going to be used.
That morning we had cleaned our
rifles extra well. We chose bullets that
looked still new. Our shots must be
true. The condemned man should not
feel any pain. He must die instantly.
“How was the trial yesterday, sir?”
I ask our commandant who had been
present at it.
He tells the story. Technical things
first, then things not directly involved.
He tells about the wives of the villagers
who had been murdered by the robber
gang. They had been called as wit-
nesses.
“You should have heard their voices,
son. When the accused man came in
they screamed out threats and spat!
“The escort unit couldn’t stop them
because force is not allowed to be used.
In the end he had to be taken out. If
that scoundrel had been handed over to
those women, I think everything would
have been over for him. They would
have eaten him for sure!” He laughs,
shaking his head.
“Were there many of them, sir?”
“There were about twenty-five, son.
Women, that is, not counting other re-
latives. Their murders were certainly
very violent. There were victims who
had reported to the army or military
police, and late at night they would be
attacked and their throats cut. You
yourself have heard about it.”
I nod.
“Late last night the wife and children
of the accused came to see him, beat-
ing their breasts, tearing their hair and
so on until it was hard for the .escort
unit to keep them in order.”
We are silent. The condemned man
is brought out of the house. His hands
are tied behind his back. He is big
and tall, with a moustache and a thick
beard. He has a cruel mouth, his eyes
glitter.
There are already many who have
come to look. About fifty per cent of
them are women and children under
age. They call out and watch, full of
lustful curiosity. We come behind him.
The ones in front are friends from the
military police. We five don’t speak
much. We shoulder our rifles with in-
difference. My chest is rather tight and
the beating of my heart far louder than
usual. Suddenly I remember the hens
which at home were always killed by
me. Killing hens is usual for me. A
routine matter. 1 was only rather re-
luctant about killing pigeons. I don’t
know why. Maybe because their feathers
are white and fine. (I’ve never killed
a pigeon that wasn’t white.) Or because
they don’t make a noise—quite different
from hens which are always cackling
noisily. Or because of their gaze. Yes,
their gaze. Pigeons can 100-k at you so
full of accusation, so full of dumb re-
gret. That’s what I can’t stand. Because
of that, usually if I kill pigeons, I do it
quickly. Sometimes until their necks
are cut right through. And the blood
squirts for a moment from the quivering
perforated artery in the gaping wound
in their neck.
“Cigarette, Nug?” The head of my
unit hands out troops-made cigarettes.
We all take one.
“To relax,” he adds. No one answers.
Our cigarettes last only a moment. Then
we are already at the graveyard. The
people are crowding around like spec-
tators at a fight at a fair.
There are many big shots present
from our own as well as other districts.
Even the doctor from headquarters is
there. He gives instructions to our com-
mandant and to the Red Cross girls who
are also there.
Suddenly there is a commotion. The
wives of the men murdered want to at-
tack the robber leader who has already
been condemned to death. They want
to join in and torture the man who has
destroyed their homes. And I remem-
ber the bodies with gaping wounds in
their necks lying stretched out in front
of their huts, wept over by their wives
and children. I remember the houses
that were turned into ashes because of
the doings of that gang. And now the
man who did it all is standing in front
of us. And he must redeem his crimes
with his soul; and that soul will be ex-
tracted by us. I have to swallow several
times. My hands are sweaty so that
my rifle is wet. My mouth is dry and
my chest tight.
I see the wife of the robber leader led
away by my friends in the MP. She is
crying and screaming. The robber
leader pretends not to hear. He just
stands calmly. Like a general defeated
in war, but too proud to show his emo-
tion. But the person I see inside him is
mankind. He is different from hens,
different from pigeons. Different from
the dogs I have beaten until they were

Balance
your diet
for good
health
Many doctors believe that choles-
terol is one of several factors
having a strong connection with
serious ailments. The more choles-
terol in the blood, the greater
the apparent risk. The amount of
cholesterol in the blood depends
on not only the amount but also
the type of fat in the daily diet.
Saturated fats (the kinds found
in dripping and butter) raise the
level of cholesterol. Poly-unsatur-
ated fats can reduce the level.
What are poly-unsaturated fats?
These fats are most commonly
derived from vegetable sources,
particularly Safflower oil, yielding
a very high content of poly-
unsaturates, a most important one
being linoleic.
What is “Miracle”? A new table
margarine made from Safflower
Oil, rich in poly-unsaturates.
“Miracle” contains cholesterol-
reducing linoleic to help you
balance the fats in your diet.
“Miracle” has a natural flavour
that all the family likes!

almost stone dead. He is the same
species as we, the same species in the
same genus “homo sapiens”. Thoughts
are scattered in my mind. The next
moment I remember the houses which
were burnt down or wrecked, the
slaughtered corpses sprawled about.
“Examine rifles!” orders the head of
the unit. We each cock our rifles. We
already know that the magazine is filled
with bullets. Still we examine them with
care. The robber leader is brought to
the front of the hole which has been
made ready. An officer reads out his
sentence. Then he is asked if he still
has a last request. He asks for pardon.
The request is refused, because the time
for asking reprieve is over, and of
course it had already been refused by
the court. People are still whispering
here and there. My MP friends clear
the line of fire. The officer takes a
handkerchief from his pocket, and
hands it to the commander of our unit
who blindfolds the robber leader with
it. Then he is ordered to kneel. The
atmosphere is as clear as crystal. I
hear the heavy breathing of all those
present. The throbbing of my own
heart surpasses them all. My sweat
wets my thick drill clothes until they
are soaking. Time and time again I
wipe my palms on my trousers. I am
standing furthest to the left. I see my
friends. We exchange looks. The
furthest to the right, the head of the
unit, has a GRI. One of the others has
a carbine 95 and three, including me,
have Japanese Arisaka rifles. The exe-
cution commandant approaches us.
“You can’t stand too close,” he says.
“Instructions from the doctor.” We
go back ten yards. The head of our
unit comes near.
“Hey, we must divide up our target.
All with Japanese rifles, aim at the
head. Me and you there, the chest.”
He goes, then comes back again.
“Take good aim. It’d be a pity if
you missed.”
I remember the severed necks of the
pigeons and the empty artery exuding
warm blood. My sweat runs quicker.
“Ready, aim . . .” The sound of us
each cocking our rifles is horrible. I hear
the hens cackling. I take aim ... I
see only the shape of the kneeling body
... I see only its wide forehead . . .
“Fire!!!” I see the handkerchief
come loose, the red blood gush, and the
body fall sprawling to the ground. For
several seconds I see nothing but that
body. I hear the women cheering.
Then I look around. Everyone is sur-
rounding the body. The children are
chased away with difficulty.
I feel isolated and alone. My head
feels empty and light. My sweat is
strong and wet.
I sit down on a rock.
I feel very tired.


OVERSEAS
1. Indonesia’s Armed Forces...
Problems on the ground... and in the air
From K. TREGONNING in Singapore
The Summit has failed and in Java
there is talk of war, and Malaysia,
faced by this, and possessing but
a minute force of a few thousand troops,
has called up its all-races volunteer
reserves. But how formidable is Indo-
nesia? Just what are its forces?
Experts here have been putting to-
gether a picture of Indonesian armed
capacity. It comprises:
Army: 200,000 men. This is a large
force. It compares with Thailand's
90,000, Burma’s 60,000 and the Philip-
pines 35,000 men under arms. About
30,000 are paratroopers, better trained,
tougher and more rough-neck than the
remainder. The Army is mainly infantry,
equipped with personal weapons, with a
weak artillery branch (its guns mainly
Russian) and its organisation is weak
above the battalion level. The two
“volunteer” battalions that sailed on June
Ist for Borneo from Java are thought to
be part of this regular army. It is more
difficult to estimate the irregular forces,
such as the saboteurs now based on the
islands a few miles from Singapore, and
the guerrillas in Borneo. Some of the
latter, however, are regular Indonesian
Army personnel, and it is thought that
perhaps five battalions are in Borneo.
Indonesia is divided into seven military
areas, but this has little military signifi-
cance; the areas are not related to stra-
tegic reality, but to the necessities of
“peaceful” administration. The Army’s
basic and almost full-time job is adminis-
tering in Indonesia. There does not
appear to be a strategic reserve; most
units are fully employed, and are scat-
tered all over Indonesia. Soekarno, as
a shrewd dictator, wants no large mili-
tary concentration to threaten him, nor
an unemployed army to grow restless;
but he requires sufficient near Djakarta
to keep him safe.
Air Force: 20,000 men. In the odd
collection of planes utilised by the Air
Force can be seen the way in which
Indonesia has secured aid from the two
major antagonists in the cold war. It
is thought the force consists of:
Bombers
18 8.25 (American)
23 IL-28 (Russian)
30 Tu-16 (Russian)
Fighters
85 MIGs (Russian)
Transports
10 Lockheed C-130 (American)
6 Douglas C. 47 (American)
6 Grumman Albatross (American)
12 IL-14 (Russian)
11 DH Otter (Canadian)
In addition the Air Force possesses
some 20 helicopters, mainly American
and Japanese, and has a weak training
wing of some 90 miscellaneous light air-
craft. It is understood that maintenance
difficulties, due to the shortage of and
non-interchangeability of spare parts and
the few trained technicians, keep ground-
ed a considerable percentage of the air-
craft (but before one becomes too opti-
mistic, remember this is what was said
of Japan in 1941).
Navy:
16,000 men
1 Cruiser, Sverdlovsk type, which
has just returned from repairs
and maintenance in Vladivos-
tok.
5 Destroyers
4 Frigates (two with guided mis-
siles)
16 Mine vessels
20 Submarines
190 Escorts and miscellaneous light
vessels
In addition the Navy has 16 Fairey
Gannet light bombers (British) and 4
Convair Catalinas (American).
Should confrontation be extended to
include the allies of Malaysia, these are
the regular forces that would endeavour
to stop Australian ships from sailing
through Indonesian waters to Singapore
or elsewhere in Asia, while Australian
aircraft (QANTAS and others) would
be barred from the skies overhead. Could
Indonesian confrontation isolate Austra-
lia from South-East Asia? It remains
to be seen.


Is this the reason
most engines still aren't in the back?
Horseless carriages weren’t horseless car-
riages for nothing.
Petrol engines may have taken the place
of the horse. But the horse left its mark.
Early cars kept their whip sockets, long
after there were no horses to whip.
Dashboards once kept the horse from
splashing mud on the passengers.
And most cars have kept their engines in
the front, where the horse used to be.
When the Volkswagen was designed, it
was assumed that horses would never be
back.
So VW felt free to put the engine over
the rear wheels, the ones that drive the
car.
That way, you don’t have the problem of
a heavy driveshaft to push around and
maintain.
You also get more weight over the drive
wheels for firm traction when the going
gets rough.
Actually, the VW’s air-cooled aluminium
engine would have been a
sensation, even in front.
But the big idea was moving
it to the rear.
It was a great step
backward in the world
of automobile design.

2. Indonesia’s
Political
Parties...
Shackling the PKI?
By FRANK PALMOS
llThile our attention was diverted to
** the ritualistic processes going on in
Tokyo, a strong anti-party campaign was
being waged in Djakarta.
It is a renewal of an old scheme origi-
nally suggested by President Soekarno —
that all parties should merge into a
“Unity” party.
It has been taken up by some Army
leaders, the non-party Press, some who
feel that this would weaken the PKI, and
others who genuinely believe a one-
party system might improve Indonesia’s
system of government.
A few days after the President left
for Tokyo, an order went out to all poli-
tical parties to submit full details of mem-
bership and finances to the Government
before luly 3. Parties refusing to do
this would be dissolved, the order said.
It read: According to the Political
Manifesto of the Republic (the policy
guide to Guided Democracy, declared
August, 1959) political parties may not
receive funds from foreign sources.
(When Soekarno declared this it was
known that the PKI had paid for much
of their 1955 election campaign with out-
side funds, and that the CIA had assisted
the Masjumi-PSI members who joined
in the Colonels’ Revolt in Sumatra and
the Celebes.)
Last year a high-ranking officer said
it was a “public secret” that the PKI had
literature printed for it outside Indonesia,
and received funds from Moscow and
Peking.
A few weeks later an order went out
to the parties for details of membership
and finances to be submitted by Decem-
ber 31—but it wasn't followed up, and
the parties successfully avoided it for
a few months.
Now, a campaign for “party simplifi-
cation” has prepared the ground well,
and party leaders are not lightly treating
the “simplification” plans—which are to
reduce the 11 parties to three, and even-
tually to one.
“Sketsmasa (“Time Sketch”), Indone-
sia's leading political magazine—with a
circulation close to 100,000 —considered
sympathetic to the Armed Forces, started
the new campaign early this year with a
long article questioning the value of
elections. A few weeks ago it delivered
a strong attack on the parties and their
members, and suggested that the system
be “simplified”.
“Sketsmasa's” editor, Soeripto Djaja,
is well informed, and has often “leaked”
information on new policies. His maga-
zine is often used as a “feeler”.
It is a national magazine, printed fort-
nightly, and the only one that has been
able consistently to reveal unpalatable
facts without being banned.
General Nasution and Information
Minister Ruslan Abdulgani often write
special feature articles for it.
The first article on the parties was
written when all parties were hoping that
the end of the State of Emergency would
mean new elections, and a return to their
former status.
■‘Hearing the words ‘General Elections’
reminds us of 1954 when parties and
their organisations were sprouting like
mushrooms in autumn,” said “Skets-
masa”.
“They got their campaign funds in
various ways. Some got money from
overseas in exchange for a guarantee to
defend a certain ideology (PKI). Others
wanted to defend the interests of a cer-

tain country which had investments here
contrary to the ideals of Indonesian
Socialism (Masjumi).
“But what was most distressing was the
corruption that accompanied the cam-
paigning. Favors and votes were bought
freely—sometimes using Government
money (PNI).
“Insulting words were used at mass
meetings—that were not consistent with
the Indonesian character.
Towards the one party state
“Tn the end the seats were won, and the
-*• people placed their confidence in the
party members elected to Parliament.
(Nationalists and Masjumi, Islam, won
57 seats each, Orthodox Islam won 45,
and the PKI 39.)
“But everyone was mad to push their
own ideas, and none wanted to compro-
mise. How did it end up? The Presi-
dent, after warning the parties several
times to think of the people, suggested a
return to the old 1945 Revolutionary
Constitution, to solve the problems.
(This Constitution gives more power
to the President, and has several “rubber”
sections.)
“But the people who called themselves
representatives of the people didn’t like
the idea. So the President had to sus-
pend elected Parliament and the Consti-
tuent Assembly, and replace them with
chosen houses.
“And when the State of Emergency
was declared, the parties worked well
together, towards fulfilment of the goals
of the Revolution.
“In these conditions, our centre-of-
the-road policies were correct. We
weren't influenced by the quarrelling be-
tween East and West, and we emerged
as the true leader of the newly emerging
forces.
“But in May, 1963, after the lifting of
the Emergency, the parties began calling
for another general election. The Natio-
nalists were in no position to contest an
election. They needed to overcome their
own internal problems first. (There was
a major split last year, and even now
differences are not settled.)
“The Nahdatul Ulama Islamic party is
only interested in religious and social
matters, and there seems no reason for
them to worry about elections.
(It was the NU which organised the
Afro-Asian Islamic Conference in Ban-
dung last month.)
“The Communists are well disciplined,
and strong, and they influence people
who don't realise they are being misled.
Last year they gave the impression that
they alone were responsible for the with-
drawal of certain economic regulations.
“A Communist election win would
mean only a victory for International
Communism (. . . it would not help
Indonesian Socialism).
“Is an election necessary?—‘Yes, yes’,
say the parties—but let us think more
about the value of an election.
“We already have Pantjasila as the
philosophical basis of the State (The Five
Principles of Belief in God, Nationalism,
Humanism, Democracy and Social
Justice).
“We already have the 1945 Constitu-
tion to rely on—and we have the general
direction of policy outlined in the Poli-
tical Manifesto.
“We already have permanent govern-
ment officials to keep the ship of revolu-
tion sailing. It is not important that the
navigators have not been formally in-
stalled.
“Elections would bring party activity,
and party activity would mean corrup-
tion and splits.”
“Sketsmasa” then quoted President
Soekarno as saying that he would not
allow an election if it created disunity,
and for this he would be “answerable to
God and the people.
“Without elections what use are
parties?”
“Sketsmasa's” last article, in June, was
a statement of clear policy advocating
the “simplifying” of the party system.
The front page read “Toward a Unity
Party” and quoted President Soekarno as
saying he was the only President in the
world who did not have a party or
organisation behind him, “for I have all
the Indonesian people behind me”.
(Since being released by the Japanese
in 1942 Soekarno has not been formally
associated with any party, though in the
1955 elections he did not seek to destroy
the general impression that he hoped the
Nationalists would win.)
Editor Soeripto began by saying that
a socialist Indonesia would be achieved
by a one-party system.
He suggested Indonesia followed the
lead of other Afro-Asian leaders who had
one-party systems. General Ne Win,
Nasser, Ben Bella and Kwame Nkrumah
were exemplified as successful leaders of
one-party governments.
Soeripto said Soekarno was a “ready
made” leader.
The magazine criticised the multi-party
system, saying that the politicians had
wasted the State’s time and money
fighting each other in Parliament and out-
side to gain power and wealth.
[Parties were thinned out around
1958. The Masjumi and Socialist Parties
were banned, and many others died or
merged. By 1963 there were only 11
parties left —though 43 had contested
the elections in 1955. Remaining parties
now are the PNI, Partindo (Nationalist),
Perti, PSII, NU (Islamic), PKI (Com-
munist), Parkindo (Protestant), Murba
(National Marxist), Baperki (Chinese),
IPKI (Defenders of Independence) and
the Catholic Party.]
Soeripto suggested that these eleven
parties be reduced to three “mainstreams”
representing NASAKOM.
The suggested division was:
Nationalist: PNI, Partindo, Baperki
and IPKI.
Religious: PSII, NU, Perti, Parkindo
and Catholic.
Marxist: PKI, Murba.
Anticipating troubles from religious
groups, Soeripto said it was now com-
mon for Catholics and Protestants to
observe the same special days, for all
Christians to join in the celebrations
after the Fast, and for Moslems to
recognise Christmas Day as a special
day. Grouping them together would
only mean formalising an existing
merger.
Murba and the PKI
“Tf the Communists are also National-
ists as they always say they are, they
should agree to merging with the Murba
party.”
The only political party which has
clearly come out in favor of the Unity
party idea is General Nasution's old
party, IPKI. But there are reports that
Murba would not object to being merged
with the PKI. Ali Sastroamidjojo, PNI
leader and twice Prime Minister, said
on June 1 that the PNI and “other pro-
gressive parties” would oppose complete
dissolution of the parties, and said the
party phobia must be “crushed”. But
he added that if the parties must be sim-
plified, his party should be the leader of
the coalition.
“If we can’t do that, we might as well
be buried,” he said.

Khrushchev
and
Comecon
Vituperation and watery
good will
By EDWARD CRANKSHAW
I>ehind the manoeuvring between Mos-
** cow and Bucharest a considerable
drama is unfolding. It involves far more
than the immediate relations between the
Soviet Union and Rumania. It threatens
the collapse of one more Russian dream.
Comecon, Mr Khrushchev’s answer to
the Common Market and, indeed, all
Western organisations for economic co-
operation, is in the process of withering
away, and The Balkans and Eastern
Europe are reverting to their old ways.
After Rumania’s act of defiance and
the Soviet Union's response to it—first,
behind-the-scenes pressure, then public
vituperation, and now weak and watery
gestures of good will—it is hard to see
how the economic integration of Eastern
Europe can be achieved by anything but
force and the use of force. If it were
conceivable in this context (which it is
not) it would, as it did in Stalin’s day,
defeat its own purpose.
Mr Khrushchev, seeing the ruin in-
flicted by Stalin on the East European
economy, resolved to repair the damage
by rationalising industrial and agricultural
production throughout the European
Communist bloc. He sought to integrate
the various national economies and he
invited each member to see itself as part
of a larger whole and to concentrate on
developing those aspects of production
which came most easily and naturally to
it.
Thus, very broadly speaking, East
Germany, Czechoslovakia and Poland
were to supply the workshops and the
forges; Rumania, Bulgaria and Hungary
the bread. These last countries were re-
quired to abate their pretensions to rapid
industrial progress and find a happy des-
tiny in feeding their more advanced

neighbors. It was all to be done by a
kindness and a little judicious blackmail
from Moscow.
A fortnight ago “Problems of Peace
and Socialism”, published in Prague, de-
clared that there had never been the
least intention on the part of the larger
members of Comecon to exploit the
smaller ones. Rumania thought other-
wise. She had reason to: Moscow had
long objected to the amount of energy
and treasure she was putting into her new
and showy steel industry.
Last week the Rumanian economic
journal “Viatica Economica” showed that
Rumania’s fears were based on even
deeper causes than the prospect of ser-
ving as an agrarian hinterland for the
Soviet Union and the Communist bloc.
rrtnE journal taxed the Soviet Union with
-*• floating a plan to “violate Rumania’s
territorial integrity” by creating a tightly
knit economic complex on the lower
Danube to include parts of Rumania,
Bulgaria, and the Soviet Union. Declar-
ing that “Rumania will not participate
in any inter-State complex, in any super-
state form of collaboration or socialist
integration” the journal asks where this
sort of process might be expected to end.
It did not mention that the Soviet Union
had already taken to itself two provinces
from Rumania. It did not mention that
Bucharest is feverishly trying to Ruma-
nianise the reluctant Hungarian minority
of Transylvania, which still looks to
Budapest. It did say, however, that if the
Russian plan went through, and if the
process continued, it would mean that
“Rumania as a State, the Rumanian
people as a nation, would be liquidated
by simple administrative means, with
economic justification in the name of
pseudo-Marxism”.
Thus fairly rational ideas about econo-
mic co-operation in Eastern Europe are
seen to be going aground not only on
Soviet clumsiness (for Russia has not
been clever enough to conceal the fact
that her plans for Comecon were de-
signed primarily to promote the prosper-
ity of the Soviet Union), but, even more
important, on ancient Balkan and East
European rivalries and hatreds of the
kind which helped to bring destruction
to the Hapsburg empire.
The only thing that held this bitterly
riven complex together was Soviet power,
represented by Stalin's army and police.
Once this brute force was removed, Mr
Khrushchev should have realised in the
light of history that he would need all his
skill as a politician and a diplomat, to-
gether with a large and flexible expendi-
ture of Russian aid, to weld these coun-
tries into a viable alliance. Instead, he
tried to force the pace. Comecon was
launched at least a decade too soon; and
the pressure was put on when Moscow
was least able to apply it. (ofns.)


India’s Morality Play
Confounding the villains ... Desai and Menon
From CYRIL DUNN in New Delhi
Tndia has shot through the first rapids
of her post-Nehru journey with
considerable poise, in spite of a certain
struggle for the steering-paddle going on
in the bottom of the boat. Looking
supremely happy, the new Prime Minis-
ter, Mr Lai Bahadur Shastri, has told
the nation that his Government is dedi-
cated to non-alignment and peace-
making abroad and, at home, to a Socia-
list democracy working towards “plenty
for all”.
Everything begins to look much the
same as it used to. Local Americans,
in particular, are satisfied that the Great
Asian Democracy has made its stability
plain. They believe the future is bright,
partly because Mr Shastri is more Indian
than Mr Nehru (Harrow and Cam-
bridge) was, in much the same way as
George Washington’s successors were
more American. It is natural that they
should suppose this to be a good thing.
There is a more general conviction
that Good has somehow or another
triumphed over Evil in the past two
weeks, as it has so often done before in
Indian mythology. Indeed, only Indians
seem sceptical about the Indian future,
perhaps because they are most familiar
with the Indian past.
It is no problem to identify the “vil-
lains” who have been confounded in the
late morality play. Everybody knows
that one of them was Morarji Desai, the
former Finance Minister. His open and
noisy bid for the seat of power—on the
ground that he was entitled to it—when
it was known that Kumaraswami Kama-
raj, the Congress Party President had
already chosen Shastri for the post, is
spoken of now as a barely credible in-
trusion upon the nation's grief.
But Westerners here in the capital be-
lieve a second “villain” was thwarted.
For Americans perhaps the strongest evi-
dence of India’s democratic stability is
that Krishna Menon was kept out of
Shastri’s Cabinet, even though—as they
see things—he plotted with Morarji
Desai to bring this about.
It may be that nobody will know until
the memoirs are written. The obvious
fact is that the power on which Desai
relied had somehow or another drained
away since those days, only a few years
ago, when Americans were commend-
ing him as a level-headed conservative,
dedicated to free enterprise and pecu-
liarly well-fitted to be Nehru’s successor.
Important stages in this erosion can
easily be discovered. They coincide with
political decisions, taken by Desai him-
self, which to an objective economist
might seem entirely creditable.
About two years ago, when he was
still Finance Minister, he brought in the
notorious Gold Control Order. Its chief
aim was to destroy the basis of smuggled
gold on which it is alleged some of the
richest Indians have founded a secret
and subsidiary economy of their own.
As a form of payment this smuggled
gold has allowed Indians to engage ille-
gally but profitably in trade with foreign
parts. As a form of savings it has
served as cover for unlawful earnings in
the domestic black market, and as a
means of tax evasion.
Unhappily, in attacking this system,
Desai struck at its weakest front —the
goldsmiths and their everyday customers,
the women of India, for whom gold
ornaments have an almost mystical sig-
nificance. By trying with reasonable
propriety to block this outlet for
smuggled gold he gave widespread
offence to unoffending thousands. He
was equally unfortunate with his plan
for compulsory savings. This naturally
upset the rich, but brought a much
sharper reaction from the harassed
middle class, already inclined to dis-
parage Desai as a Rightist hostile to the
Socialist welfare State.
Middle-of-the-road Cabinet
Co, in his hour of need, Morarji Desai
found Big Business quietly backing
Shastri. This was not primarily because
Desai had done them any serious harm—
though he had shown an unexpected lack
of sympathy towards some of their
enterprise-—but because he was thought
to have lost popular support. None of
Krishna Menon's friends in India—
where he has far more than many
Westerners may suppose—believes for a
moment that he was mixed up with
Desai in any plot to win power. They
argue that if there was a plot Menon's
aim could only have been to split the
vote, shut out both Shastri and Desai,
and let in Nanda, acting Prime Minister,
and a stolid Socialist.
Anyway, it is commonly assumed by
Indians that Krishna Menon will rejoin
the Cabinet in due course, if only be-
cause now that Nehru has gone, only
he and Indira Gandhi, Nehru’s daughter,
can command the emotional enthusiasm
of the masses.
Meanwhile, Shastri’s Cabinet has a
placid, middle-of-the-road look. For
most Indians it has been spiritually en-
riched by the inclusion of Mrs Gandhi.
Some think it has been slightly biased
towards the Right by the readmission
of S. K. Patil. Coming from a poor but
entirely urban background (his father
was a Bombay policeman) Patil is a plain
Tory who thinks very little of Socialist
planning but accepts its inevitability in
India, partly because there are not
enough big businessmen to form a capi-
talism of major political significance. He
is a sensible, outspoken man with latent
power and considerable presence.
Communists split
T>ut Kamaraj seems bent on off-setting
Patil by getting a renowned Socialist
into the party and conceivably into the
Cabinet. This is Ashok Mehta, a small,
sturdy, bearded man with the glum look
of a minor apostle. He is also an out-
standing political economist. It is per-
haps a part of Nehru’s tragedy that some
of the best brains in India, once with
him, found themselves obliged to leave
him and waste years in Opposition par-
ties chiefly engaged in splitting and re-
forming like blobs of frog spawn in a
stream.
It remains to be seen how this Govern-
ment will behave and what freedom it
will have to act on its own. There is
no sign that Kamaraj and his inner
circle now known as The Syndicate
and with Sanjiva Reddy installed as their
liaison officer within the Cabinet —are
relaxing their grip on affairs.
So the new forces in India are arrayed
to meet the pressures of the future. The
defeated are behaving graciously, at all
events in public, though some think
Morarji Desai, for one, may now seek to
rejuvenate his power, perhaps at the
fount of Hindu orthodoxy. The Oppo-
sition, never very threatening, were
caught by the transition in (as Congress
must see it) heaven-sent disarray.
This was surely a moment in history
for which the Indian Communists had
waited. But it found them absurdly
split into two parties, each holding abu-
sive Press conferences and claiming sole
right to propagate the Word. The Socia-
lists have lost Ashok Mehta and with
him much of their prestige, and are
forlornly trying to hold on to public
interest with out-moded references to
civil disobedience.
As for the conservative Swantantra
Party, with noble ill-luck its two chief
leaders chose the eve of Nehru’s death
to rock public opinion and their own
security by recommending a compromise
settlement for Kashmir.
With good management and this sort
of fortuitous aid Kamaraj seems to have
won for his party its breathing spell.
How this will be used may begin to
appear next month when Shastri, on his
first major trip abroad, toddles into the
Commonwealth Prime Ministers’ con-
ference in London, (ofns)


PROFILE
The Enigma of
Peter Thomson
Four times British Open winner ... but then?
From JOHN STOBBS in London
Just a dozen years ago, a fair, solidly
built young Australian with the
simple, crisp-flowing swing of a
natural master, opened an attack upon
the British tournament circuit. Almost at
once he broke right through. Gay, ex-
trovert, friendly, he rode success easily
and with brilliance. Within five seasons
he had made himself firm annual favorite
in the Open, front-man in tournaments,
friend to everyone, and was adding a
page of his own to Britain’s golfing his-
tory.
It was the more remarkable an inva-
sion in being as popular as it was profes-
sionally rewarding. By the time he came
to the Open at Lytham in 1958, ordinary
golfers, golf-writers and even a fair
number of professional players positively
wanted him to win again and make it
four Opens in five years; and even when
David Thomas, then 22, played the Open
of his young life to tie with him it
seemed inevitable and right in the nature
of things that the Australian should win
the play-off, as he did.
Between the ages of 22 and 29, in
the seven years from 1952 to 1958, Peter
Thomson had notched up the unique
Open record of winning four times and
for seven consecutive years never being
worse than second. He was beaten only
by Hogan in 1953 and by Locke, whose
last two wins of four came in 1952 and
1957. In seven years not a single British
professional finished ahead of him. The
more you look at all that, the more
astonishing the achievement seems. In
the British competitive field, the man
stood almost on his own.
Tempora mutantur . . . The full flow
stopped there. Thomson has won num-
bers of tournaments since, round the
world, visits Britain each summer, and is
always a name and a man to watch. He
is still a beautiful, smooth striker of the
ball, and a sparkling competitor, as his
recent final rounds at Stoke Poges and
Cork—6s and 67 to come second by a
single stroke in both tournaments —again
show. But both the Open and Thomson
have changed; and now, at 34, his poten-
tial becomes enigmatic. He's not old
enough to be an elder statesman of the
game, though his outlook has something
of that in it; not in full enough form to
command opposition the way he did, yet
stili young enough to have anything up
to 16 years of his best game ahead of
him.
Two things certainly have happened.
First, the Open (it starts this year on
July 8) has begun again to attract a
larger number of players of Thomson’s
own class as world-travelling, full-time
competitors: men like the Americans
Palmer, Nicklaus, Rodgers, New Zea-
lander Charles, and Thomson’s fellow
Australian Nagle. The British Open is
now much more difficult to win, both
against this overseas invasion and
for golf is a mental game—against the
explosion of publicity which accom-
panies it.
Secondly, and in the face of this,
Thomson has not committed himself to
accept the now wholly sacrificial terms
of the new world-class top golf rat-race.
Having seen himself, perhaps, the dangers
to a man’s life of dedicating it too ex-
clusively to any flood-tide of success, he’s
followed a personal inclination to step
slightly aside.
“I’ve always felt that I have still an
amateur outlook. I’ve never considered
that playing golf for money was going
to be the most important thing in my
life, but a means to an end—an end that
would be something a bit more useful
to society. In many ways, the club pro-
fessional is a lot more useful member
of society than a professional who plays
golf for his living. My own long-term
aim is to build up capital, which equals
time to do other things—study, travel,
write!”
In his years of Open supremacy,
Thomson was committing 10 months of
every year to continuous tournament
play. Now he has cut that down to six.
Business responsibilities in Australia, and
the responsibility of a second marriage
with two young children are part of it.
But there's also perhaps a deeper change
of viewpoint, of perspective.
“As a man gets older, he's apt to stand
outside himself and take a good look.
Now that I know a lot more, I should
say that the chances of any young man
setting out to do what I did between
1952 and 1959 would be very .slim.
You see, I never really suffered to win.
I had the luck of starting out at the
right time.
“In 1949 I was the boy wonder. The
Australian professional field was not then
big enough to attract many young
people. But my enthusiasm was kindled
by von Nida. He was the fellow who set
the example of going abroad and winning
money, just as Locke set it in South
Africa. I was one of the first to follow
on —though there are more and more
taking the road now.
“Then, what is difficult to many golfers
seemed to me quite natural. The life of
a winning golfer is not a difficult c
not to anyone naturally gifted. T! 's

a great deal of luck, though, in becoming
a winning player. Nothing can set a
young man back more certainly than a
tragedy early ol in his career—just fail-
ing to win when he should have won.
On the contrary, a lucky break to win,
as came to me, builds up self-confidence,
and in the end that’s what puts you above
other people if you are confident in
yourself.
“But then again, golf is always only
50 per cent yourself and 50 per cent the
other fellows. In the end, whatever you
do, there’s bound to be a break against
you; and once things begin to flow
against you, it’s like playing on turf
you’re not sure of—the doubt is in the
mind before the shot is started! It can
only help your attitude if you feel a
crowd of people in sympathy with you;
but if you feel the crowd have lost inter-
est that’s a terrible feeling. You can
tell the difference at once, by the size
and spontaneity of applause.
“The most important thing in golf?
Careful planning, calm thinking, and the
ordinary logic of common sense. Golf is
played with the brain. The big thing in
golf is judgment, not power. Good judg-
ment calls for logical observation. To get
back into top form each year now I
have to learn the short cuts of getting
there. I’ve had to think a bit harder.
You’ve got to understand the technical
part of the game, as opposed to the
natural winner’s ‘just fingers and feel’.
If you can get everything working in fine
touch, you can play as well as ever.
Part of becoming more mature as a
golfer is learning to understand your own
game, and your own character, of course.
That’s more or less fixed by the time
you’re 17.”
Thomson’s enthusiasm and interest are
spreading out from his own game now.
In golf he’d like to see two things—more
young British players taking off any-
where abroad for the experience and
effect on their games.
And he’d like to realise a plan for a
complete annual circuit of top golf,
standing on its own resources quite
apart from the American one; and taking
in summer in Britain, spring in South
Africa, the Middle East, India and the
Far East, then winter —their summer—
in Australia and New Zealand. “I'd
like far more of the British golfers to
come to our part of the world, and help
work up this new circuit in places where
the popularity and the rewards of golf
are growing fast.”
Then there are his business interests
at home. Skin-diving with an architect
friend started them wondering about the
tremendous wealth of food in the seabed
around their part of the Victorian coast.
They set out to realise it, establishing an
industry new to that part of the world:
skin-divers and a cannery exporting sea
food, mainly abalone (a flat shellfish
about 10 in. across) to China and Japan,
where it is a delicacy, and latterly to
the west coast of America. “Out in
Australia,” he says, “if you run a good
business you still stand a good chance
of getting bigger.”
He admits there’s something of yearn-
ing in him for his original days as an
amateur. “I’d love to play golf again
for fun, and call golf a game, like my
friends around me at home.”
Meanwhile —on to the Open, and
what does he feel about it? “I’ve be-
come now a more mature person. The
things I did by intuition in my earlier
years, I now do by logic. It’s a matter
of organising yourself to get the best of
your capacity. I still have the incentive
to win.”
In all its history only Harry Vardon,
James Braid and J. H. Taylor have won
the Open more than four times: and
they all between the years of 1894 and
1914. It would be distinguished com-
pany to join, indeed, 50 years after.

Bye Bye Birdie
The £100,000 wildlife export business
By “MAJOR MITCHELL”
It was once common practice for
zoos to trade in animals as a respec-
table means of boosting finances.
However, the 20th century brought with
it an increasing acceptance of responsi-
bility by governments for the survival
of their wildlife. Financial exploitation
of one kind or another was responsible
for the extinction or near-extinction of
several animals and birds, and most
countries have since placed severe re-
strictions or total prohibitions on mone-
tary dealings in wild-caught species.
In recent years zoos have also been
placed under restrictions, but some have
been reluctant to accept the principle.
There are other reasons less readily ap-
parent than the mere unwillingness to
give up a source of profit.
One is that “Zoological Societies” are
not necessarily societies formed to study
animals in the academic sense. In many
cases they were founded by wealthy
keepers of rare animals and birds and,
in Australia, also by people interested
in introducing the familiar furred and
feathered denizens of their homeland.
The sparrow, starling, rabbit and fox
are some of their more successful “accli-
matisations.”
The tradition has persisted and the
governing bodies of the Australian zoos
still run by private societies have many
members who are also enthusiastic pri-
vate keepers of rare birds and animals.
The world-wide restrictions on fauna
transactions has reduced the species easily
available, and it is understandable that
they have often been critical of the laws
which curtailed their hobbies.
Nevertheless, it seems clear that if cer-
tain animals and birds are to survive,
these policies must continue. It is not
generally realised how rare some species
have become. As an example, it was
estimated in 1962 that if zoos were to
continue to be supplied with orang-utans
at the rate of 60 a year, the animal could
become extinct in 10 years.
article, by an expert, highlights
a problem that was recognised
in Australia as long ago as 1803
the destruction of unique native
fauna. As much as 40 per cent of
Australia’s mammals are so rarely
seen as to be considered extinct, and
many classes of parrots and finches
have virtually died out. While the
problem of exports is only one factor
among many trading within Aus-
tralia and changes of land-use pattern
are others—our correspondent makes
out a case for review of the export
trade.
Australia has a poor record in wild-
life conservation, and has only recently
introduced any comprehensive regulation
of commercial exports of birds. This
was not altogether the fault of the
Federal Government. (Section 92 of
the Constitution is a barrier to Common-
wealth interference in interstate trade.)
In 1959 the president of the Bird Ob-
servers’ Club of Victoria pointed out
that the official figures for commercially
exported birds from WA and SA alone
totalled nearly 100,000 birds per annum,
and that reckoning on 75 per cent dying
before the dealer received them from
the trapper, 400,000 birds a year were
being trapped.
Overseas traffic had grown to a
£IOO,OOO-a-year business. It was diffi-
cult to distinguish aviary-bred birds from
wild-caught, or even to determine with
certainty which species were being expor-
ted. In that year the Commonwealth
called a conference of State officials in
an attempt to introduce uniform State
policies. The attempt failed, and in
December, 1959, the Minister for Cus-
toms announced that overseas fauna
exports for commercial purposes were
prohibited. Export on a bona-fide zoo-
to-zoo basis or for scientific purposes
was permissible, and contingent on a per-
mit granted by the State concerned.
In South Australia' natural history
societies have been concerned about
their vanishing bird life for many years,
and also at the fact that the SA Zoo-
logical Society is specifically exempted
from the provisions of the SA Animals
and Birds Protection Act.
In early 1959 the SA Field Natura-
lists’ Society and the Royal Society asked
the SA Government to add a schedule to
the Act naming rare birds which dealers
would not be given permits to trap.
Inexplicably, their request was not sup-

ported by the SA Ornithological Asso-
ciation. Instead, and at a later date,
this society expressed the view that the
Act was adequate if enforced.
At the end of that year the Association
was split into two dissenting camps, with
“birdwatchers” opposed to a group in
which dealers, zoo council members, and
bird fanciers were prominent.
TMlany members were also particularly
disgruntled to learn that all three
members of a sub-committee of the Gov-
ernment-appointed body which advises
on fauna matters, although all members
of their Association, were also executives
of the Zoological Gardens. This sub-
committee was formed specifically to dis-
cuss permits to trap birds for the coming
year 1960-61. Its respective members
were the Director of the Zoo, Mr V. D.
Haggard, a vice-president, Dr Alan Len-
don, and Mr C. C. Burfield, a council
member. The last two gentlemen are
also well-known and wealthy bird-fan-
ciers, and many people felt they had been
placed in a somewhat equivocal position,
especially in view of the fact that SA
was then the only State which permitted
“protected” birds to be trapped com-
mercially without any formality of pub-
licly declaring an open season.
Permits could be given for some
species to be taken without limit on num-
bers, including a few birds the Field
Naturalists believed should not be taken
at all because of their rarity. Discussions
about the proposed “rare bird” schedule
continued within the Ornithological Asso-
ciation. These culminated in 1962 with
a letter to the Minister for Agriculture
objecting to Dr Lendon’s belief that a
bird difficult to identify from a more
common species should not be included
in the schedule. Dr Lendon had said
that trappers who accidentally took such
a bird would be needlessly exposed to
prosecution. The Association differed
in that it felt this rule ran counter to the
accepted principle in British law that
ignorance was no defence, and that this
precaution to protect trappers seemed
unnecessary. The letter also protested
at the removal of the Major Mitchell
cockatoo from the proposed “rare bird”
list, claiming that it was difficult to attri-
bute its total extinction over an area of
some thousands of square miles to any
other possible cause except commercial
trapping. (Major Mitchells fetch as
much as £2OO each in USA.)
The Adelaide Zoo is owned by a
private society, presently known as the
Royal Zoological Society of South Aus-
tralia, but until 1937 it was called the
Zoological and Acclimatisation Society
of SA. However, the rules of this Society
place sole management of the affairs of
the Society in the hands of its council.
This body consists of a president, elected
annually, nine vice-presidents, each of
whom, once elected at an annual general
meeting, “shall remain in office until
he shall either retire or die”, twelve
“elected members”, four of whom are
elected at each annual general meeting
for a three-year term, the “Lord Mayor
of Adelaide for the time being” and
three members nominated by the Gov-
ernment. Thus, although nominally
owned by the RZSSA, the control of the
Society’s members over the council is
tenuous —nine of the council members,
once elected, never have to face their
electorate again, and four other mem-
bers are either appointed by the Govern-
ment or are on the council ex officio.
Of 26 members only 13 are answerable
to the Society nominally owning the
zoo, and of these only five come up for
election in any one year. In practice
the council is a small, almost indepen-
dent, self-perpetuating body. It calls
the Society’s annual general meeting
in the lunch-hour on a weekday in
the Lord Mayor’s parlor. Only a few
members attend, and it must be admitted
that the time is hardly convenient to
many. The election of new council
members is a formality. The Society as
such could hardly be said to have exis-
ted, as no other meetings have been
called for years, and the council, in
effect, is answerable only to itself, despite
the fact that half its funds come from
the Government and the rest from the
public’s gate-money.
It became publicly clear last year
that all was not well when Mr Gerald
Sanderson Hargrave, the son of a former
Lord Mayor of Adelaide, and “Avitra-
ders” (one of a group of eight Adelaide
fauna-dealing companies controlled by
John Skipper of Sydney) were both con-
victed of making false Customs declara-
tions in respect to bird exports. Hargrave,
a bird dealer, was the Zoo’s appointed
agent. In fact, the appointment was made
verbally and was not even recorded in
the council's minutes. The magistrate,
Mr D. F. Wilson, said the arrangements
were “as loose as the w'ind.” It emerged
that the procedure was for overseas zoos
to approach “Avitraders” with orders for
birds. If the Adelaide Zoo had stocks,
Hargraves paid the Zoo a fixed price. If
the Zoo had no ready stock in hand, the
birds were supplied from “Avitraders”
or bought from other Adelaide trappers
or dealers.
TV/I any of the overseas zoos supplied
were acting as commercial traders.
Thus, in giving an unrestricted agency,
the Adelaide Zoo had allowed its name
to be used for what in effect was a purely
commercial venture, and, one would
imagine, a very lucrative one.
Hargrave’s agency gave “Avitraders”
a near monopoly of fauna exports.
Official figures show in the year July,
1961, to June, 1962, that 75 per cent of
all birds sent overseas left in the name


MAYPO OE/WNI
There are many famous Greek chron-
icles of remarkable friendships be-
tween man and dolphin, Herodotus,
Plutarch, Oppius and many others.
It is therefore not surprising that to
the Greeks the dolphin was the sym-
bol of grace and friendliness. In
Greek mythology the first dolphins
were said to be sailors, who, to
escape the magic of Dionysus, the
God of Wine, leapt into the sea and
were forthwith turned into dolphins.
Recently a famous scientist has sug-
gested that this relationship between
man and dolphin is something more
than myth and legend, that the dol-
phin is the only mammal with a
potential intelligence comparable to
man, that dolphins can even reproduce
human speech. If you are interested
we can tell you much more, not only
about dolphins, but also about the
magic of Dionysus at
The
Black Dolphin
Merimbula
of the Adelaide Zoo. A further 24 per
cent left Taronga Park in one consign-
ment. Thus 99 per cent of the birds sent
overseas in this year went out through
the two zoos.
Permits for these “zoo” exports were
granted by the State fauna authorities.
Still unexplained is their acceptance of
the idea that some of these shipments
were all for public exhibition. Examples
are a shipment from Taronga of 928
cockatoos and parrots to the Zoological
Gardens, Ostend, Antwerp and Bredene,
Belgium, and 1088 finches to the Zoolo-
gical Society of Tel Aviv, Israel, from
Adelaide Zoo. Even if a 75 per cent
mortality rate was expected, orders of
this magnitude still look excessive as
zoo exhibits.
Zither surprising things came to light
” in the Adelaide court case. Asked
by the prosecutor how two shipments of
“Softbills” (insectivorous birds) had
come to be shipped to the US, Hargrave
said that “Sir Edward Hallstrom had
asked him to ship them, and he had
taken this to mean that the birds were to
be shipped on behalf of the Adelaide
Zoo.” Sir Edward is a vice-president of
the Adelaide Zoo, but it seemed a very
loose arrangement whereby a council
member resident in another State was
permitted to give orders for shipments.
The Minister for Customs’ 1959 state-
ment notwithstanding, the President of
the Adelaide Zoo, Mr F. Basse, also said
in court that “Hargrave asked if we
would be interested in exporting a large
number of finches. I said ‘no’ because
the mortality rate was too high in small
birds and the monetary return too small.”
Shortly after this, at the annual gene-
ral meeting of the Adelaide Zoological
Society, a member said he was disturbed
by Press reports of exports in the Zoo’s
name, and yet could find no mention of
income resulting from this in the annual
financial statement. He moved that the
council be asked to prepare an account
for members of the Zoo's trading in
animals and a clear statement of policy
on trading. His motion was defeated,
and Mr M. T. Phillipps,- another vice-
president, said “at no time in its long
history had the council withheld infor-
mation from members.” Nevertheless,
one of the many criticisms of the past
conduct of the Zoo's affairs made by the
Government - appointed committee and
released a few months later was that
“Although from February, 1961, to June,
. 1963, nearly £12,000 was received from
the sale of fauna, only minor reference
is found in the minutes of the council,”
and “Financial transactions were dealt
with through a separate account and did
not form part of the council's income
and expenditure state*rtent as published.”
Setting the public’s mind at rest, how-
ever, as to whether council members
themselves had been involved in im-
proper handling of their Zoo’s inmates
was the Government reply to an Oppo-
sition Member who asked in February
this year whether council members were
involved in illegal sale and exchange ac-
tivities for their own aviaries. The
Minister for Lands, Mr Quirke, said the
committee of inquiry “found no evi-
dence.”
The affinity between bird dealers and
Adelaide Zoo seems closer than most
people might reasonably expect. The
head bird-keeper at Adelaide Zoo is an
ex-shareholder of “Avitraders” and three
other of the Skipper companies.
Again, the defendant Hargrave admit-
ted he bought 60 pairs of finches from
“a Mr White” a “boxmaker” at the Zoo.
He “did not know where White had ob-
tained his supply of finches.” Mr White,
the company records show, is also an ex-
shareholder in two of the Skipper com-
panies.
The 1963 Annual Report of the Ade-
laide Zoo contains “An Appreciation”
by M. Jean Delacour of France, an inter-
nationally known and wealthy bird-fan-
cier. M. Delacour records his visit to
the Adelaide Zoo and expresses his grati-
tude to Dr Alan Lendon and Mr R.
McKechnie, who “very kindly took
charge of us”. But who then is Mr
McKechnie? A Zoo councillor? An
ordinary but enthusiastic member of the
Zoological Society? Surprisingly, he is
neither of these. Mr McKechnie is a
licensed dealer and bird trapper. Again,
company records show he is a former
shareholder in three of the Skipper com-
panies, including “Avitraers”, and is
now a director and principal shareholder
of another, Adelaide’s most well-known
pet shop, “Petcenta”.
1%/Ir McKechnie has also received some
more recent publicity—in Novem-
ber 1963, he was convicted of the illegal
possession of protected birds, and in
April this year, after being charged by
the RSPCA, of having kept horses for
pet food without fodder.
Further evidence of the unusual state
of affairs at Adelaide’s Zoo came with
a Government enquiry late last year to
investigate the dismissal of Mr W. R.
Gasking, the Zoo’s new Director of four
months’ standing. The report said, for
instance, “that no complete record of
numbers and kinds of animals and birds
had existed for some years, and that this
was a serious breach of Commonwealth
Quarantine Regulations”.
The SA Government has taken Mr
Gasking under its wing, announced that
he has been appointed investigator into
the establishment of a Healesville-type
sanctuary, and reaffirmed their confi-
dence in his ability.
To date the dissident members have
made no call for another special meet-
ing, perhaps from financial or spiritual
exhaustion. The Zoo council has made
the gesture of moving Mr Basse back
into the ranks of its vice-presidents, and
has placed Dr P. S. Watts, its former
honorary veterinary officer (and coun-
cillor), in the position of president. It
has also filled the former position of
director by employing a “Chief Execu-
tive Officer”, Mr W. E. Lancaster, an
Englishman and former Colonial Mala-
yan Government veterinarian. Many
people have been puzzled at some coun-
cil members’ anxiety to be rid of Mr
Gasking. The Healesville committee
seem to have found no great errors of
judgment in the manner in which he
carried out his duties. Mr Gasking has
said he “had no idea he was coming to
Adelaide to be Zoo director in name
only,” and stated that “Healesville could
stand Government investigation any
time.”
While there are some Government
moves afoot, the whole question of the
administration of the export of fauna
and the role of some zoos seems a
question for very close Government
scrutiny.


Around Melbourne
A FEASIBILITY STUDY OF A HOT POTATO
Oight back to the days when Mel-
bourne always was referred to
as “Marvellous Melbourne” we have
been trying to establish ourselves as
THE city. Back in 1880 we held an
international exhibition which was a
beauty by world standards. The
Exhibition Building alone cost
£250,000 and we had the fleets of
five navies out in the bay.
Actually Sydney had an exhibition
a year earlier but, as the “Herald”
pointed out on October 1, 1880, the
Sydney affair was very hurriedly
got up and its overseas exhibits
were few and unimportant, whereas
our exhibition was a spectacle “such
as had not been witnessed in the
history of the world in a community
not 50 years old”.
In 1888 we had an even grander
international exhibition, the Cen-
tennial, to celebrate the 100th anni-
versary of the first settlement on
Australian soil. Sydney was prac-
tically ignoring the affair, so we had
to do something. The exhibition
covered the entire Carlton Gardens
and, according to the “Argus”, it had
the biggest single electric light in-
stallation the world had ever seen.
Regrettably it was a financial disaster,
and from that day our dear old
Exhibition Building was always re-
ferred to as the white elephant in the
Carlton Gardens.
Many people thought it had cured
us of international exhibitions for all
time. But no. Last week gilt-edged
invitations from the Lord Mayor
went out to almost every news, radio
and TV man in town. Even some
lucky football writers received one.
The invitations revealed nothing
beyond the fact that it was a “Press
conference on a matter of national
importance”, and the affair was to be
at the Southern Cross Hotel, Suite 36,
instead of the Town Hall. The hotel
has given the suite, free, to be the
permanent headquarters of the project
committee.
It was impossible to spring a leak;
right until the very day the whole
affair was “top hush”. But when we
arrived we discovered that the public
relations firm of Eric White was in
full command, and we all received
a fat, plastic-covered Press kit titled
“The Australian World Fair Project”.
Someone in the gathering crudely
remarked: “Aha, an Eric White
elephant.”
The first page said: “A World Fair
would be the biggest event in Aus-
tralia’s peace-time history, far over-
shadowing the 1956 Melbourne
Olympic Games in importance, cost
and magnitude.” The speakers were
the Lord Mayor, Cr Leo Curtis, and
the former Lord Mayor, Sir Maurice
Nathan. Sir Maurice had thought of
the idea two years ago and had been
working on it ever since. The reasons
for top security were all too obvious.
Sadly unlike the Olympic Games, one
could not bid for the Fair as a
city. You could not bid as a State.
It had to come direct from the
national Government to the Bureau
of International Exhibitions in Paris.
Tn the world fair business the BIE is
the union, the big club. It’s one
of the club rules that members always
take part in each other’s exhibitions.
Australia until now has always
thought membership too costly, so
before we get a fair we will have to
join. Of course, you can always go
it alone, like New York, a most
conspicuous non-BIE member. But
even Melbourne is not yet in New
York's class.
As Sir Maurice put it, honestly and
correctly: “It’s a hot political potato.”
The bystander would think that Mel-
bourne had a good chance. After
all, we have three good Victorians
on our side—the Prime Minister, Sir
Robert, the Deputy Prime Minister,
Mr McEwen, and the Federal
Treasurer, Mr Holt. So Sir Maurice
wrote three excellent and extremely
well-documented letters to Sir Robert.
We received copies in our Press kit.
Each was marked “Highly Con-
fidential” and two started “Dear Sir
Robert” and one “My dear Mr Prime
Minister”.
Sir Robert replied in formal
terms that the Commonwealth
Government could not consider the
matter until it received a complete
feasibility study. And here we get
the first sign of pain in the writing of
Sir Maurice: . . We had hoped
sincerely that our efforts could have
received some support, even of a
token nature, from your Govern-
ment. Although personally • dis-
appointed that our submissions did
not strike a more responsive note, I
hasten to add my complete apprecia-
tion of your position.”
So the first step for Melbourne is
to conduct the investigation which
has the imposing title of “Feasibility
Study”. Melbourne firms and in-
dividuals are being asked to put up
£50,000, for the kick-off. Sir Maurice
has no qualms about getting the
money. The contributors will be
World Fair foundation members. The
idea is to bring in an overseas firm
like the Stanford Research Institute
of Chicago to find out whether we
could do it.
Sir Maurice expects his answer in
nine to 12 months. There were some
delicate questions. What if Sydney,
Brisbane or Adelaide felt they were
ideal sites? They could produce
studies, perhaps more feasible than
ours. Sir Maurice said he was aware
that other cities could do this, but,
said he firmly, he felt at this stage
his responsibility was to Melbourne.
The costs were described as big—
£2o-£25 million. The timing would
be in the early 19705, say 1972.
There was one more indelicate
question. Would Melbourne still have
6 o'clock closing in 1972? Sir
Maurice and the Mayor were shocked
into silence for a moment. But then
they remembered that Essendon Air-
port was Commonwealth territory,
beyond the reach of Bolte, Rylah &
Co. People could drink all night.
The site? That would be up to
the feasibility study, but civil aviation
would be vacating Essendon Airport
in 1968 to go to Tullarmarine, and
this would make a magnificent site.

REVIEWS
TELEVISION
The Tragedy at Kronborg
Hamlet on his own territory
By WILLIAM DANIELS
Hamlet at Elsinore. Channel 2. Syd-
ney.
The BBC production of “Hamlet” at
Kronborg Castle, Elsinore, was, I
would say, the most triumphant three
hours of television drama ever seen in
Australia. On his four-hundredth anni-
versary Shakespeare was translated to the
screen with consummate style and stun-
ning visual effect, yet the production
never betrayed the hugeness of the play’s
conception nor the magnificence of its
poetry and drama. Producer Peter Luke
and director Philip Saville took great
licence with the text, they re-ordered
scenes, re-assigned lines from one
character to another, and modernised
the syntax and vocabulary (there was
even a scene in bed between Claudius
and Gertrude that was more than ex-
cusable).
Olivier’s film version was a bravura
piece of gimmickry and facile atmo-
spherics. This production was no less
tricked out with contrived camera angles
and lighting effects. But this time they
heightened the drama; they were not
merely employed for their own sake. One
memorable tableau had Hamlet’s face in
a large close-up to the right of frame
while a vast vaulted hallway stretched
away behind, the strangely bright natural
light filtering in through the row of
windows. And in Hamlet’s confronta-
tion with the Ghost in Act I, as he reeled
and ranted on the turrets and cliff-tops
with the wind blowing his hair and the
waves crashing behind, the supernatural
was splendidly evoked. The Ghost him-
self provided a sometimes hysterical voice
of doom howling in the wind—perhaps
an outrageous liberty, but sufficiently
chilling in its effect. The castle was
never allowed to intrude (there was no
deliberate scenery-mongering) but the
Chapel, the Great Hall, the King's Cham-
ber, the Queen's Room, and the Globe
Room of Kronborg, with their huge
rafters, pillars, and arches, dark alcoves
and magnificent furnishings, all con-
tributed to the reality and grandeur of
the performance. This was no elegant
set, but the sturdy, prosperous seat of
Danish royalty.
The producers, as one might have
feared, did not let themselves be carried
away by their location, they merely put
it to its best possible use. Nor was there
any flamboyance about the exteriors.
When Hamlet and Horatio approached
the grave-digger (only one), or when
Fortinbras marshalled his army, the
cameras might have been directed by
Ingmar Bergman, so stark and beauti-
fully simple were the compositions and
use of natural landscape. Hamlet was at
home, not on a sightseeing holiday.
Out for all its Renaissance authenticity,
it was a modern interpretation, and
Christopher Plummer was a modern
Hamlet. His performance was brittle,
with quicksilver changes of mood and
erratic changes of attitude. But the
transition of mood was always conscious,
for Plummer's Hamlet was at all times
astute, sophisticated and intelligent. He
had not so much indecision as barriers;
he was not weak, he just wasn't quite
sure how to direct his strength. I didn't
like his first soliloquy, it gave indications
of a pansy-neurotic characterisation, but
it belied his subsequent reading of the
part. In the nunnery scene (111, i) he
made the most of every nuance and
delicacy to indicate the affection beneath
his harshness, and during the play scene
(111, ii) he was like a nervous young
animal, gay and witty, but earnestly
aware of the purpose in hand. The soli-
loquies were delivered as respites from
that purpose, during which he summed
up the events so far, and, true scholar
that he was, pursued the intellectual and
fatalistic ramifications.
Hamlet is full of questions which he
asks of himself, and Plummer suggested
that they are at least in part rhetorical.
Looking a cross between Robert Hardy
and the young Beethoven, Plummer gave
Hamlet passion and insight, pain and
pleasure; he was no ailing, indecisive
boy, but the cultivated and frustrated
boss’ son, sure of his authority but a
wastrel of his talents.
The supporting cast were no less excel-
lent. Importantly, they remained a sup-
porting cast, and did not try, as actors
sometimes do, to usurp what is essentially
Hamlet’s play, and one-up him in the big
scenes. Robert Shaw, as Claudius, was
no one-dimensional villain. In 111, iii,
when he prayed, he suffered for his
crime, but he played the public king with
all the surface pomp and circumstance,
with well-judged dignity, and suggested
very well the hollowness of Claudius’
relish in disposing of his nephew. June
Tobin looked very young as Gertrude,
but she went through hell in the closet
scene (111, iv), and personified the silly,
easily-led, but good at heart Queen with
a minimum of wholesale emotionalism.
Alec Clunes (a memorable Hamlet him-
self once) was a little gross but suitably
preposterous as Polonius, although occa-
sionally he stepped out of the generally
understated tone of the production and
hammed it up for all he was worth. But
perhaps the most remarkable perform-
ance was that of the inexperienced Jo
Maxwell Muller as a giggly, pubescent
Ophelia. When she was mad she was
angelic, and then provocative (in a
marvellous touch she tried to bite
Claudius’ hand), and in her short
soliloquy after being urged to a nunnery
(111, i) she achieved a distilled innocence
and sincerity of emotion that was so
moving it seemed momentarily to stop
the show.
THEATRE
Unlucky Dip
The First Four Hundred Years.
Theatre Royal. Sydney.
Richard 111. William Shakespeare.
Genesian Theatre. Sydney.
Saturday afternoon during my
childhood I set out with my friends
to go to the pictures, clutching my six-
pence. But we could not get in, so
we decided to spend our sixpences on a
beano at the sweet shop. Since one
usually had a penny for lollies, this was
an orgy. But afterwards, to my dismay,
I felt sick rather than satisfied, and the
world seemed a very flat place.
“The First Four Hundred Years” is
a Shakespeare beano: a lavish presen-
tation of the best scenes from eleven
plays. But, in spite of the distinguished
names in the cast, Kristian Fredrikson's
beautiful costumes and Warwick Arm-
strong's graceful set, the programme is
flat and cloying. Worst of all are the
orotund introductions to the assorted
scenes.
This production at least enables Keith
Michell to show his versatility. A
swaggering Petruchio; a moving York, at
bay to the “she-wolf of France'’; a be-
wildered, crumbling Antony. But best
of all I liked his “low” characters: his
love-lorn shepherd Silvius, delightfully
matched by Jennifer Sterke's Phebe; and


his down-to-earth Launce, complete with
dog Crab. But it is a waste of a good
Shakespearian actor not to use him in
a full play.
Googie Withers does not seem alto-
gether happy in these exercises. Her
tigerish Margaret of Anjou baiting the
dying York is a powerful sketch, but her
other characterisations lack variety. Joan
MacArthur, with her rich voice, does an
excellent Emilia from “Othello”.
The lesson of this production seems to
be that people who can stomach Shake-
speare whole don’t care for him in bite-
size pieces, and people who don’t like
Shakespeare are not tempted by the pre-
digested product, either.
A pleasant contrast is afforded by
Margaret Rieneck’s exciting production
of “Richard III”, the second in the
Genesian Shakespeare season, which
gives us this well-drilled and hard-work-
ing company at their best. The clarity
and realism of this play suits them much
better than the mixture of realism and
romance of “Much Ado”. The men,
who were stiff and uncertain as conven-
tional, fairy-tale figures, are much hap-
pier as the venal Lords of England. John
Byrne is a clean-cut Richmond, and
Leon Tanner a handsome, princely Buck-
ingham. The women of the company
play the four royal ladies with commend-
able restraint. As a result, the scene
in which the four sit down and bewail
the death of kings—their husbands and
sons—is very moving, instead of being
the ranting match it so often is.
By skilful use of lighting and the fore-
stage, the action moves rapidly and con-
tinuously, dominated by a back-drop
depicting the grim, grey bulk of the
Tower of London, flanked by a hectic,
blood-colored sun. The rapid action not
only makes for excitement, but also en-
ables us to hear most of the text of this
long play.
What struck me was the way the play
hammers home its themes: the wicked-
ness of Richard, causing butchery, fear
and woe; the ambition, the treachery, the
wrangling and scrambling for power of
just about everybody else. The chief
interest of a play lies in this unfolding of
themes, which is why “Scenes from
Shakespeare” are so disappointing.
Peter Carroll as Richard 111 gives us
a most attractive villain. Mis-shapen,
yes, but otherwise well endowed with the
graces of the Renaissance prince. Intel-
ligent, witty, a master of histrionics,
swift of decision and sudden to anger,
he dominates the nervous world about
him simply by being cleverer and pos-
sessing more self-knowledge. With a
detached Machiavellian cynicism he is
capable of mocking his own deformity,
and a small smile of enjoyment at his
own villainy flickers around the corners
of his mouth, as he sees himself out-
witting other schemers. Peter Carroll’s
performance seemed to me quite remark-
ably polished and supple for a young
actor and I enjoyed every word and
gesture of it.
Next week I shall be reviewing the
Sydney University Drama Festival of
avant-garde plays which is now running
at the Union Theatre.
MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
Black Comedy
The Tower. Hal Porter. St Martin’s
Theatre. Melbourne.
HThe tower is “higher than anything
A in Hobart Town except the signal on
the cathedral”. All those who look upon
it may gauge the height of Sir Rodney
Haviland’s ambition. Amy, Sir Rodney’s
step-daughter, looks upon it and names
it well: “a senseless folly, a monument
to vanity”. Eventually, Amy is to die
a victim to this vanity, but before dying
she learns an important truth about the
tower: that it need not be a thing “only
to look at” —that “from it one may look
East and West and South and North.
One can see the mountain and the
estuary, one can look towards the sea
and the horizon . . .”
The first and most important thing to
say about Hal Porter’s play is that, unlike
its principal symbol, it is exclusively
something to look at —from it there is
nothing to be seen in any direction.
Normally, during a performance of a
serious play with any claim to merit,
one's reaction includes some kind of in-
voluntary, or semi-voluntary, chase after
associations. One tends to compare,
with the author's presentation, one’s own
observation of manners, or insight into
motive, or philosophical preconceptions,
or emotional response, or whatever it
may be—in general, one looks for the
hooks which will attach this experience
to life. Mr Porter’s play seems to pro-
vide none, or few, of the usual hooks—
yet it catches on, and demands that we
look as it catches on, almost entirely
because of the interest of its formal
qualities.
Clearly, Mr Porter treats the usual
vehicles of meaning in an unusually
formalised way in this play. I have
mentioned about Sir Rodney’s vanity, and
his ambition, but this is not in any
sense a play about vanity or ambition.
These qualities, and those of the other
characters, are exploited simply for the
sake of the effect they make—an effect
which has more to do with detachment
than with involvement. Indeed this
applies also to the characters themselves,
intensely animated and interesting, they
are yet quite flat, and make no claim on
our attention once we leave the theatre.
The setting is colonial Tasmania, and
Mr Porter has gone to great pains to
touch in the details of manners, dress,
and speech: but the aim here is not
authenticity for its own sake, so much as
a kind of black comedy of manners—or,
perhaps, a comedy of manners in re-
verse, in which, rather than searching
for effects which will illumine the man-
ners, he has chosen the manners as a
means of circumscribing his effects. Most
striking of all are the orchestration of
dialogue and sound effects, and the
unabashed deliberation with which the
curtain is used.
The only major doubt I have about
Mr Porter’s organisation of his materials
concerns the character of Marcus Knight,
the convict father of Sir Rodney's
adopted son, and the lover of Amy.
Knight seems rather too shadowy and
ambiguous a figure. There are other
touches of uncertainty here and there;
it seems unlikely that any sound system
could produce some of the complicated
effects Mr Porter asks for; and occasion-
ally an ugly line obtrudes —once, for
example, Sir Rodney remarks: “I per-
ceive ingratitude in your present atti-
tude.” But over-all, Mr Porter's techni-
cal control is remarkably assured.
It is difficult to say anything useful
about this play in comparison with other
Australian plays, since there is none
other even remotely like it. At the very
least I think it may be said that this is
the most theatrically powerful play yet
written here, and the only one to encour-
age a fresh look at the categories.
I have left myself little room to com-
ment on the excellent quality of this pro-
duction. Apparently the London per-
formance of the play was impaired by
the inadequacy of the lad playing Edwin,
Sir Rodney's stepson. This is certainly
not the case here—Andrew Guild is
masterly, and he is well matched by
Norman Kaye as Sir Rodney, and Joy
Mitchell as Amy. Paul Kathner’s set is
the best I have yet seen from him, and
Mr Porter has cause to be very grateful
indeed that Irene Mitchell was the pro-
ducer.

The Couch. Director, Owen Crump.
Esquire Theatre. Sydney.
Strait-Jacket. Director, William Castle.
Victory Theatre. Sydney.
The Telltale Heart. Director, Ernest
Morris. Esquire Theatre. Sydney.
A gently-nurtured young lady in
one of Jane Austen’s novels, when
presented with a new batch of Gothic
novels, enquires anxiously: “And are
they all truly horrid?” I approached
the week's three thrillers in the same
hopeful spirit, but the authentic shudder
of delicious terror was absent.
I thought Robert Bloch’s script for


“The Couch” well constructed, and got
a number of unintended laughs out of
his “Strait-Jacket”, but my flesh didn’t
creep once. “The Couch” might have
made a pretty good film with better
direction, but Owen Crump develops
Bloch's story unimaginatively, except for
some rather unfortunate essays into arty
flashback. Grant Williams gives a deft
performance as the plausible young
psychopath whose favorite pastime is
stabbing people with ice-picks; but
Crump is so intent on avoiding sensa-
tionalism that he directs the film in far
too low a key.
Understated direction was never the
fault of William Castle, and “Strait-
Jacket” is certainly a livelier film than
“The Couch”, though a good deal sil-
lier. Castle is not particularly original
as a, director of horror films and often
relies on mere goriness as a substitute
for style and imagination. However,
thanks to some attentions by the cen-
sor, “Strait-Jacket” is by no means
the bloody business that the subject
might indicate.
Once again the script is by Robert
Bloch, but it certainly isn't as logically
worked out as “The Couch”. The sur-
prise ending is completely dishonest,
since it involves a climax in which a
character who has seemed rather boringly
sane suddenly starts to mop and mow
and is carted off in a plain van, as mad
as a two-bob watch.
Why Joan Crawford (who probably
doesn't need the money) decided to star
in this is anybody's guess. Perhaps she
felt envious of Bette Davis, who got all
those fruity mad scenes in “Baby Jane”.
Anyway here’s Joan pulling out all the
stops in the role of a lady who has
spent 20 years in the booby-hatch after
finishing off her unfaithful husband and
his lover with an axe. She embarras-
singly returns to the bosom of the family
just when her daughter is being courted
by the scion of the local stately home.
Joan Crawford has a high old time
rolling those rocking-horse eyes. The
others in the cast don’t really bother to
act very much, but merely stand round
cautiously observing Miss Crawford’s
shenanigans. They're probably right
she does enough emoting for the lot of
them. “Strait-Jacket” won't alarm you,
but it may well amuse you.
In “The Telltale Heart”, one man
murders another and is subsequently
haunted by the sound of the dead man’s
heartbeats. This is the only recognisable
resemblance between the film and Edgar
Allan Poe's chilling short story (not sur-
prisingly, the author’s name is mis-spelt
in the credits). The plot has been ex-
panded to include a triangle drama of
singular banality, and, since the direc-
tor spends most of the film developing
this theme, it’s too late for him to inspire
any excitement when the belated horrors
start.
The scene seems to be Paris (the
street in which the action is set is called
the Rue Morgue and there’s a “Taverne
Alsacienne” nearby) yet the characters
have names like Edgar Marsh, Carl
Loomis and Betty Clare. Edgar, a dim
“young” man, falls for a girl who lives
just across the road and who never
draws the curtains when undressing or
(as it later turns out) when making love.
After striking up an acquaintance with
her, he is silly enough to introduce her
to a womanising friend. You can guess
what he sees through that uncurtained
window.
Mad with jealousy, he beats his rival
to death and conceals the body, only to
be persecuted by remorse and the ever-
beating heart. But since two-thirds of
the film has passed by now, it’s very
hard to work up any concern about his
troubles, particularly as Laurence Payne
makes him such a dull, scruffy fellow that
one can hardly blame the girl for taking
up with his friend, who at least has a
certain seedy gloss.
In its heyday the horror film was one
of the finest showcases for the wit and
originality of a director. There still are
directors capable of taking advantage of
this, but they all seem to be working
for television. Some of the 62 episodes
of the “Thriller” series, for instance (to
be telecast again, probably in 1965)
were classics of this genre, with brilliant
contributions by directors John Brahm,
Herschel Daugherty and Ida Lupino,
among others, and including another Poe
adaptation and a remarkable one, “.The
Premature Burial.” If only the cinema
could do as well!

Precision
and Finesse
Sydney Symphony Orchestra Concerts.
Conducted by Dean Dixon. Sydney.
TlThen Dean Dixon’s appointment as
"" musical director of the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra was announced,
some concertgoers were apprehensive.
When Dixon first conducted in Sydney
eighteen months ago, he gave the im-
pression of not being completely in
control of the orchestra; he seemed to
dissipate much of his energy in trying
to direct every player at once, to which
the orchestra responded by some-
times playing with less than complete
unanimity. Dixon’s intelligence and
musicianship were manifest, but it was
not clear whether he was capable of
getting the orchestra to consistently give
of its best.
These doubts were allayed by the first
of Dixon’s current series of Sydney con-
certs. After three days’ rehearsal, and
working with the handicap of an injured
right arm, Dixon had the orchestra play-
ing with quite remarkable precision and
finesse. There were few errors in
intonation and attack, and ensemble
work and tone were generally excellent.
The brass excepted, the level of execu-
tion was high by any standard, and well
above the average for the last two or
three years. Dixon himself was quite
at ease on the rostrum, occasionally not
giving the beat and letting passage-work
move along under its own momentum,
but never losing command.
But apart from being an able leader,
Dixon is a very fine musician. Just how
good he is was shown by the first item
on the programme, Haydn’s forty-sixth
symphony. This is one of Haydn's less
substantial works—which is not to say
that it is a minor work—and lends itself
more readily than most to the dear-old-
Papa-Haydn treatment that his works
are too often subjected to. Dixon com-
pletely avoided this approach, and
instead proceeded to demonstrate how
much musical wisdom had gone into this
work. Everything was carefully worked
out and controlled: each phrase, each
note was executed with scrupulous regard
for its importance in the overall plan.
The inner parts came through clearly
without ever being obtrusive or getting
more than their due share of emphasis,
and similarly balance and proportion
between the different parts of each
movement, and between the movements
themselves, was carefully maintained. It
was a particularly thoughtful perform-
ance in fact one of the best perform-
ances of Haydn that I have heard.
Tchaikovsky requires care of a dif-
ferent kind. He was not the architect
that Haydn was, but he was the equal of
Berlioz and Strauss in his command of
orchestral writing, and his sense for the
weight and density of orchestral sound.
It was this aspect of Tchaikovsky the
first-rate technique, not the second-rate
personality that makes his music popular
with casual listeners that Dixon paid
most attention to in his performance
of the “Pathetique” symphony. Tchai-
kovsky’s exaggerated gestures and
glutinous harmonies, the ominous ease
with which passages lend themselves to
being heard in isolation from their
musical context these became unim-
portant compared with the stylishness
and glamour of his orchestral writing,
and his melodic fluency. One unusual
feature of Dixon’s performance was that
the first movement was taken at a much
lower dynamic level than usual, turning
it from the work’s centre of interest into
a prelude to three movements which work
out the drama foreshadowed in the first.

Nothing But the Best
The British novelist in an affluent society
By BERNARD BERGONZI
VTowadays the British novelist is subject
to all sorts of pressures, internal as
well as external, to catch the mood of the
times, to convey the very quality of our
lives at the moment we are living them,
to be up-to-the-minute in his references
and his very tone of voice. The reasons
for this are too complicated to be
summed up briefly; the rapid pace of
change, far more exacting now than at
any point in the past, weighs heavily on
us all, and the novelist, with his un-
usually sensitive antennae, is likely to be
more conscious of it than most. There is
also the tyrannous role that fashion plays
in a consumers’ society, tied to a con-
tinually expanding economy; built-in
obsolescence applies to more things
than American automobiles, and the
novelist who sprinkles his pages with this
year’s with-it references may well make
his book seem out-of-date with depres-
sing rapidity. An example: in 1961,
Christine Brooke-Rose, who is a for-
midably clever writer (author of a tough
academic book on metaphor as well as
several skilful novels), published a fairly
diverting satirical work called “The
Middlemen” about public relations, tele-
vision, advertising, journalism, and other
inviting targets. One of its significant
placing details was that the well-dressed
young men wore narrow violet ties: such
ties did have a brief vogue in the winter
of 1960-61, but rapidly went out of
fashion, and by the time Miss Brooke-
Rose’s novel appeared they were only
worn by working-class teenagers. When
the period between completion and pub-
lication of a novel must inevitably be
several months, the writer always runs
the risk of being caught out by a sudden
shift of the whirligig of taste.
And when so many novels contain an
avowedly documentary element there is
always a possibility that they may be
overtaken by a fate unknown to the less
time-ridden books of earlier generations
obsolescence (this is something dif-
ferent from coming to seem old-
fashioned in a purely literary sense). At
a time when the English Press is con-
sumed by eager accounts of feuding
between Mods and Rockers, it is in-
structive if a little sad to dip into Colin
Maclnnes’ 1959 novel, “Absolute Begin-
ners”; this was, in its way, a pioneering
fictional exploration of what its eighteen-
year-old hero called the Teenage Thing.
Consider the poignancy of its opening
sentence: “It was with the advent of the
Laurie London era that I realised the
whole teenage epic was tottering to
doom”. Now, who, in the era of the
Beatles (and of Cilia, the Stones, the
Searchers), remembers anything of Laurie
London (who must be a tottering grey-
beard of twenty by now; he was fourteen
when he cut a disc called “He’s Got the
Whole World”)? Mr Maclnnes’ novel
can be read with the respect that is due
to an outdated but historically important
treatise in sociology, but it’s extremely
hard to take seriously as a novel any
more. Too much stress on the documen-
tary is the death of fiction. And, for that
matter, the cinema, with its ability to pin
down a whole wealth of significance in a
single image, is probably better at cap-
turing the feel of a particular period:
a film such as “Nothing But the Best”
seems to me to have caught brilliantly
the mingled stylishness and vulgarity of
the lush expense-account world that one
sees faithfully mirrored in the glossy
weeklies; it is likely to remain a defini-
tive memorial of the final months of the
Macmillan era (or the Hulme interreg-
num).
VI/’hat is curious is that for many
T novelists any period now needs to be
defined in terms of its superficial if strik-
ing images: advertisements, popular songs,
fashions in dress. Thus, Miss Brooke-
Rose, in another novel, “The Dear De-
ceit”, went to great pains to get the
period detail right in various chapters
set in the early years of this century,
with the result that these details seemed
rather over-obtrusive (as opposed, for
instance, to the comparable but more
natural observations in Henry William-
son’s sequence, “A Chronicle of Ancient
Sunlight”, which is a vast act of total
recall by a writer now in his seventies).
One can’t imagine Thackeray or even
George Eliot being so painstaking and
self-conscious, though admittedly they
had fewer changes to record when they
looked back thirty or forty years. But
in our day we are burdened with a pain-
fully acute sense of the past; we are all
historicists now, and worry much more
about anachronism than most earlier
authors Shakespeare for instance.
One of the most talented of the young-
est English novelists, Julian Mitchell,
who has published four novels and is
still under thirty, has shown himself
rather dangerously open to the lure of
the sharp contemporary reference. His
first novel, “Imaginary Toys”, dealt with
considerable wit, though not much form,
with the tensions—religious, social, sex-
ual—between a group of young people
in Oxford, c. 1958. It showed that in-
side Mitchell the novelist there lurks a
Palinurus-like essayist, rather given to
extracting high-toned intellectual fun
from the eddies of fashionable cultural
discourse. As when one of his char-
acters invents a book called “A History
of Onanism”:
Reviewed by Lionel Trilling in
“Partisan Review”. Expanded review
printed in “Encounter” and later col-
lected in “Fugitives from the Double
Image of Liberal Tradition”. “Fugi-
tives” reviewed by Barzun in “Parti-
san Review”. Expanded review
printed in “Encounter”, collected, etc.
In England the review of the review
would be serialised in the “Observer”
and given flattering reviews in all the
reviews. After a month it would be
remaindered, after a year sold for pulp.
But “A History of Onanism” would
by then be in its eighteenth impres-
sion . . .
I enjoy this; but at the same time it de-
pends, rather parasitically, on the cul-
tural modishness of what it is sending
up.
In Mitchell’s latest novel, “The White
Father”, which seems to me by far his
best, there is a thorough probing of the
world of current teenage culture and pop
idols which makes an interesting con-
trast with Maclnnes’ “Absolute Begin-
ners” of five years before. The observa-
tion is all tremendously exact, and the
picture of the metropolitan scene is
rather on a level with that of “Nothing
But the Best”. Particularly good is Mit-
chell’s picture of the megalomaniac Mr
Brachs, head of the vast Brachs empire,
going steadily mad in his inaccessible
penthouse at the top of the London sky-
scraper that houses all his many con-
cerns: restaurants, soft drinks, teenage
clothes (“Brachs’ jeans are tighter!”), an
agency for promoting pop singers.
Brachs, and what he stands for, has real
mythic power. In parts of this novel
Mitchell gets across some basic ideas
about the implications of living in a
society geared above all to constantly
expanding consumption, giving a fictional
enactment to some of Hannah Arendt’s
insights. For the first time in Mitchell's
fiction, the essayist has become fused
with the novelist.
But I am reminded rather strongly of
the title of his third novel (about a peri-
patetic Englishman in America): “As Far
As You Can Go”. In “The White
Father” Mitchell has gone about as far


as he, or anyone, can reasonably go in
catching the essence of the contemporary
moment. “The White Father” is, I think,
a considerably better novel than “Abso-
lute Beginners”; but I have a strong
feeling that by 1969 it will seem equally
remote.
And this is surely something no novel-
ist can welcome unless he is avowedly
throwing out an expendable object, like
those avant-garde painters who work
with perishable materials. I have a feel-
ing that the contemporary note will be
sounded less in the fiction of the im-
mediate future: possibly something like
Miss Ivy Compton-Burnett’s timeless,
though nominally late Victorian, never-
never land will come to seem a suitable
setting for fictional encounters. Or one
might find a parallel in the uncluttered,
non-natural istic stages of Beckett and
Pinter. In our kind of society there will
always be inducements for the novelist
to compete with the television documen-
tary, the glossy weekly, or the trend-
hunting gossip-columnists of the daily
Press. But it isn't really his business to
do so, and he can damage his art if he
tries too hard: there might still be some-
thing to learn from the great Victorians’
relative aloofness from telling contem-
porary detail.
Out of Africa
Harama. Wilfred Fcwler. The Cresset
Press. 375. 3d.
“ITa ram a” is one of those books on
emergent Africa that have little but
their topicality to commend them. Its
central figure is not the African chief
of the title, but the narrator, one Wood,
a member of the British Colonial Service.
He moves in an inconsequential fashion
through a series of unrelated experiences,
constantly doing the right thing, fre-
quently misunderstood and unappreci-
ated, undistinguished by perception, pas-
sion, vice or human frailty; in his rise
from Assistant District Commissioner to
Provincial Commissioner he must surely
be one of the least enthralling characters
in recent fiction.
It is somewhat surprising that this
should be so, for his life is, to say the
least, eventful. No sooner has he taken
up his first appointment than he is con-
fronted with a dishonest chief, who mis-
appropriates tax-money and kills a sub-
ject who threatens to expose him. He
then deals with, or at any rate experi-
ences, a yellow fever epidemic, and a
succession of jungle killings, suspected
of being the work of a secret Leopard
Society, but which turns out to be only a
bad case of real leopards. In the second
half of the book, he is still at it, dispen-
sing justice, resisting bribery, corruption
and blackmail, coming into contact with
another ritual murder cult, real this time,
and dealing with riots and mob-violence,
all without any sign of being touched
by what happens to him. Even in his
dealings with Harama, the chief who
befriended him when he was an in-
experienced young officer, and whom he
must strip of his tribal authority in one
of his final actions as an administrator,
no hint of a real, complex human
relationship is allowed to disturb the
unselective reporting of incident.
This failure is all the more disappoint-
ing when one considers what might have
been done with such a theme. The
account of a sensitive, liberally-minded
man, caught between the fossilised
empire-mindedness of some of his col-
leagues, and the impatience of an
African nationalism that rushes on to full
independence with such haste that it
ignores or crushes some of those most
willing and qualified to help, might have
provided a record of real interest. Such
a man Wood was undoubtedly intended
to be, for he says he holds all the appro-
priate values. The failure of his creator
to see him from the inside, though,
means that his reactions to his experi-
ences never succeed in being anything
more than obvious, even trite.
This lack of perception is not re-
deemed by any skill in construction or
writing, both of which are remarkably
inept. The book has little unity other
than the autobiographical one, and, since
the subject is so uninteresting, that is
not enough to hold it together. A man’s
life may be made up of inconsequential
events, but it is surely the author's duty
to impose some sort of order on that
experience if it is to be meaningful to
the reader. Here, for instance, is Wood
hearing of the circumstances of a par-
ticularly nasty murder from an African
who is grateful to him for saving the
lives of his wife and baby in an earlier
incident:
My heart-beat suddenly raced, and
blood pounded in my head. In that
brief instant of smouldering resent-
ment he communicated something to
me which made Binta's murder unim-
portant. Fatigue and sleepiness left
me: I knew I was being told about
Ulo, a fabulous organisation about
which neither anthropologists nor
police knew anything except that it
existed. The poignancy of the ex-
perience was unbearable . . .
After these revelations, the reader may
fairly be expected to have a pounding
heart as well, but he is soon disappointed.
The informer dies, apparently murdered,
but Wood makes no attempt to follow
this up, and, when he is transferred to
another district, apparently forgets that
he is the sole repository for these price-
less secrets, for the incident is never
mentioned again. This sort of starting of
unpursued hares is one of the book’s
most irritating features. The quality of
the writing is, I think, fairly exposed in
the quotation above. In the manner of
the tougher school, there is a good deal
of decorative rather than functional
physical mess, but this cannot make one
interested in the people, a list of whom
is thoughtfully provided at the begin-
ning of the book. The characters are so
unmemorable that I referred to it fre-
quently, until I decided that it didn’t
matter who was who. They are real
enough, in their tedium, and, to be fair,
one must admit that the observed detail
seems accurate enough too, when the
local color is not trowelled on, but one
is left with the feeling that it is somehow
indecent that the enormous, raw, cruel
upheaval that is post-war Africa should
be used as the background for a story
as trivial as this.
DERICK MARSH
Rice Bubbles
Minority Report. Elmer Rice. Heine-
mann. 525.
Rice, to use his own term, is
a “liberal intellectual”, and his auto-
biography is a protracted definition of
that term. It is one long parade of his
high-minded principles and uncompro-
mising dedication to the theatre. Or at
least this is what Rice would have it be.
In fact it is a ponderous and rambling
characterisation of the sensitive, politi-
cally and socially aware artist, battling
the wicked commercialism of Broadway
and Hollywood, and emerging, with his
integrity intact, as an ageing patriarch
and father confessor of American letters.
He is a living cliche, and, for all his self-
righteous non-conformity, a bit of a
hypocrite as well. For Elmer Rice is not
much more than a hack dramatist, pro-
claiming his morality in pompous, hack-
neyed terms, and relying on the manipu-
lation of popular sentiment and technical
hi-jinks to create a momentary effect.
His career as a playwright, even as he
tells it, is the career of a minor talent
desperately trying to emulate his initial
success, and, when finances dictate it,
quite content to put art temporarily
aside and sit down and write a shallow
melodrama in which he has no more in-
terest than how much cash it will bring
in.
“On Trial”, his first play, “Street
Scene”, for which he won the Pulitzer
Prize, and “Dream Girl”, his three most
successful plays, are all rather mediocre
contributions to American drama of the
century, and are already dated. He
himself emerges as a very ordinary sort
of man, with an uninteresting and un-
original mind, and an uninteresting way
of writing about it. He makes almost
everything sound dull —even the hectic
activity of the ’twenties and ’thirties in
American theatre, the expatriate society
in Paris, the early days of the motion
picture industry, its personalities and
problems, the Depression—such subjects


as should virtually write themselves all
lose color and excitement at the plodding
hand of Mr Rice.
Forced to leave school at fourteen,
Rice worked in a solicitor's office and
studied in his own free time until he was
admitted to the Bar at the age of twenty-
one. But he hated the sterility and repe-
tition of legal work and was disquieted
by the deliberate betrayal of justice he
encountered in the name of the law. On
a brave impulse, he quit the profession to
become a writer, and used his back-
stage knowledge of the law in several
courtroom dramas. He had an immedi-
ate success with “On Trial" and from
that point has spent his life writing,
directing and managing, with brief spells
as a film scenarist, and at the age of
seventy is still working on new plays.
His life is a story worth telling, be-
cause it has been involved with the whole
course of twentieth-century literary his-
tory. But he was not the man to write
it. To tell one's life story, for Rice,
is to record chronologically what one
did, where one went, and how one felt,
as precisely and in as much detail as
possible. Consequently, “Minority Re-
port", particularly the account of his
first twenty-one years, is burdened with
an incredible amount of homely trivia
and domestic irrelevancy. Since his
philosophy is so commonplace, his
lengthy recitation of it becomes turgid
and boring, and seems somehow remark-
ably naif. And for a man who has
written a number of successful Broadway
comedies, it is surprisingly humorless.
Only once does Rice raise a laugh, when
he says of Paul Robeson, he was “not
only black but red". If anything,
“Minority Report” is much better as a
travel-book than as a portrait of the
artist as a young liberal intellectual. His
impressions of Russia in particular and
his generalisations on the Soviet mentality
are vivid and lively, even if they are pre-
dictable. He is always better writing
about other places and other people
than he is writing about himself, when
the exaggerated modesty appears and the
embarrassing social conscience rears its
too familiar head.
Rice is a club man. He has been a
member, invariably in an active official
capacity, of dozens of guilds, committees,
pressure groups, and co-operatives, usu-
ally connected with theatre or films, pro-
tecting rights, fighting censorship (which
he conversely admits having tolerated in
his own plays), and racialism, and waving
all the other banners of the archetypal
literary rebel and advocate of universal
freedom. All his judgments, responses
and feelings he relates to a standard, to
his code of values, so that he can satis-
factorily explain his reactions to himself
and categorise everything and everybody
he comes into contact with. Rice sees
himself in the “minority” of the title,
but it is a common enough type, and his
report merely adds one to the number
rather than drama to the tale.
MICHAEL THOMAS
Pop Theology
No New Morality. Douglas Rhymes.
Constable. 18s. 9d.
Tn theology, as in other fields, there has
A always been the phenomenon of the
hep, the OK, the a-la-mode, and not
for trivial reasons: in any period there
are for the Church as for other institu-
tions particular needs, areas of the Faith
which claim special attention because of
their topical relevance or difficulty; and
particular ways of dealing with these will
speak with special force and gain domi-
nance in the discussion. Hence at pre-
sent, it would seem, the hegemony with-
in “Reformed" theology (the term
“Protestant" becoming rapidly more
taboo each year) of the axis Bultmann-
Tillich-Bonhoeffer, of “de-mythologising”
and “religionless Christianity"; and,
within Anglicanism, of the Cambridge
theologians led by Dr Alec Vidler, with
whom Canon Rhymes is associated.
What is I think genuinely new in this
presentation is the translation of “hep”
into pop theology: the emergence of
something approaching a mass audience
for “professional”, speculative theology.
This phenomenon is, of course, a result
of the general raising of educational
standards in the West, of which we have
seen only the beginning. The process is
accelerating rapidly, too: universal sec-
ondary education has been achieved in
years where primary education took
decades, and a very general spread of
“tertiary” education is on the way, as we
can see from America’s case.
One of the most striking symptoms of
all this is the paper-back revolution,
which has nowhere been more active
than in the field of religion in general,
and even of full intellectual theology in
particular. (To the surprise and discon-
cert of the theologians, let it be said
the “Honest to God” furore was com-
pletely unforeseen by either its author
or its publisher.) A very extended and
searching debate is now going on among
a great number of Christians, of all
communions, on an astonishing variety
of topics; and this must only be wel-
comed hard conscientious thought be-
ing a duty of intelligent believers in any-
thing.
Indeed, the process is so general that
it would be impossible, and disastrous,
for authority to attempt to arrest it.
Happily, authority shows not the slightest
sign of doing so indeed, Church
leaders spend a great deal of energy
pressing the faithful on to further efforts.
So Canon Rhymes’s book is to be re-
garded with benevolence as the symptom
of something very right even if one
thinks much, of its deliverance plain
wrong; anathemas are out.
His book takes up the debate on
morality sparked off some time ago by
the English Quaker group’s pamphlet on
sexual morality.
Where it appears to stray somewhat is
in making an opposition between law
and love: classical Christianity presents
rather a tension between these two ways
of describing the necessary nature of
Christian behavior in respect of other
persons. The Scriptures after all are full
references to law. And not merely to
some rigid legalism the Psalms are
imbued by a joyful apprehension of the
splendor of God's laws; and the gospels
themselves present the Christian way as
a law, in an important sense Christ
himself speaks of love as a command-
ment.
This is a paradox, if you like; a ten-
sion which is humanly impossible to con-
trol, but which the Christian attains in
trusting himself to Christ's will. Or per-
haps one can say that both ‘'love" and
“law" are modes of our understanding of
the nature and will of God a will
which is perfect, and single, and does
not itself exist in the various categories
by which we recognise and describe it.
To some extent Rhymes, like Dr
Robinson, presents for subsequent demo-
lition a caricature-view of traditional
Christian witness; he certainly does in the
matter of Christian teaching on the body.
It is sad to see a Churchman of his
eminence lending himself to the libel
that St Paul preached contempt of the
body: rather, with all other orthodox
witnesses, he teaches the highest view
of the body's splendor. After all, if your
body is the temple of the Holy Spirit,
and is to be gloriously transformed into
a new life within God's very being, it
seems fair apostolic comment to warn
you against abusing it for the sake of
some cheap post-Rcmantic idea of ful-
filment through any old sexual activity.
When he comes down to actual cases
Canon Rhymes is pretty muddled. We
get (as usual from this school) some
horror-stories about Christian congrega-
tions rejecting unmarried mothers, and
so on: of which the only thing to be said
is that such behavior is certainly un-
Christian, and certainly not typical of
the Church, institutionally or individu-
ally. Again, one is to be very careful
not to do anything that “denies one’s
true nature": so that if you’re a sailor
in the slums of Tangier it's all right to
go with a kind prostitute; similarly, we
are all to be understanding about (actively-
practising?) homosexuals. But all this
largely ignores the uncomfortable Chris-
tian duty of sacrifice : all sorts of in-
eligible impulses visit our sin-confused
sensibilities, but the Christian finds self-
fulfilment precisely in self-forgetfulness,
in loving and trustful resignation of his


own will to Christ’s, even if that means
passing up some beguiling gratification.
Canon Rhymes’s Christ in fact gets
uncomfortably like a good post-Freudian
Chap Who Will Understand, while we
all potter about working out a new
casuistry which ignores all off-putting
words like sin and sacrifice. My final
complaint against the Canon is that he
simply doesn't say where he stands on
the classic positions of the Church in
these and other questions; and it was
Bonhoeffer himself who said that, for
the Christian, belief (and hence love)
must be preceded by obedience, by
docility and self-resignation.
But let me hasten to make myself re-
spectable by saying that doubtless the
book will stimulate thought and discus-
sion, and so forth; it is lucky for all of
us that the Holy Spirit so patiently in-
vests our activities, and turns to what
good is possible our stumblings and
wanderings.

China’s World
Documents on China’s Relations with
South and South-East Asia: 1949-
1962. Edited by G. V. Ambekar
and V. D. Divekar. Allied Pub-
lishers Private Ltd., Bombay-New
Delhi-Calcutta, 1964. Rs. 30.00.
CGmmunist China does not bestride
the world like a Colossus not even
when viewed from a vantage point in
the Pacific.
The internal policies of the Chinese
Government, with their ruthless crash
programmes and their unrelenting ideo-
logical pressure adjusted to the mentality
of intellectually underdeveloped children,
may be peculiarly unpleasant. But by
and large, the white man has shown little
disposition to shoulder the yellow man’s
burdens and responsibilities. Interven-
tion in China for the sake of the Chinese
is not on the current Western agenda.
The fear or hatred of China that exists
outside its borders is based on the belief
that as a great national power with a
militant Communist ideology it is neces-
sarily expansionist and aggressive, a
menace to its neighbors and to the
world. For this belief there has so far
been less specific evidence drawn from
China’s actions than most people think.
That Communist China, for all its
bluster in words, has so far rigorously
eschewed “reckless adventurism” in
deeds is the first point noted by almost
all of the more careful students of
China’s foreign policy. The problem of
Communism in South-East Asia, serious
as it may be, is not an example of the
export of revolution; since Korea, China
has not embarked on any sustained phy-
sical support for revolutionary move-
ments outside its territories. Even in
Indo-China, the undoubted trickle of
Chinese arms and military supplies
across the border bears no significant
relation to the US aid and supplies to
the other side. The incidents on the
Indian border in October and November,
1962, were widely regarded at the time
as showing that China was genuinely ag-
gressive; more recent studies by such
anti-Communist academics as Professor
L. C. Green and Dr Alastair Lamb throw
considerable doubt on this view. The
evidence is clear that there is a genuine
border dispute involved in which there
is at least a good deal of support for the
Chinese claim. The incidents themselves
seem to have begun from considerable,
though probably unintended, provocation
by Indian patrols acting without the
knowledge of the Indian Government.
The Chinese forces that pushed forward
were most probably acting primarily to
dnd this nuisance once and for all; they
halted of their own accord while the
Indian forces facing them were still in
retreat, and they then withdrew; they
succeeded in ending the nuisance of
provocative border raids without in any
way converting the issue into anything
more than a border dispute.
In general terms, the points made
above are only reinforced when one
reads Professor G. V. Ambekar and Mr
V. D. Divekar's collection of .179 official
documents emanating from China and
South and South-East Asian nations, and
from the United Nations and the United
States. The documents are classified into
10 sections: the general principles of
Chinese foreign policy, Afro-Asian soli-
darity, measures for containing Com-
munism (SEATO and other defence
treaties), boundary problems, overseas
Chinese, China’s economic and trade re-
lations, Formosa, Korea, Tibet and Laos.
Each section is preceded by an editorial
introduction, excessively emotive in tone,
and for the most part misleading and
useless, even in the light of the docu-
ments that follow. The documents them-
selves are often interesting for the
general reader (if taken in small doses)
and useful to the student; there is, how-
ever, an excessive number concerned
with mere formalities, acknowledgement
of replies, etc.
Taken as a whole (and no ordinary
reader would want to take the book as
a whole), these documents do little to
illuminate China’s foreign policy they
merely indicate the need for caution.
They show us a China carefully
feeling its way in foreign relations
in spite of its militant ideology. They
do nothing to indicate whether this
caution is the result of an economic and
military weakness that may in future be
overcome, of a tough Western policy of
“confrontation” (which is very likely),
or of a belief that the rest of Asia can
be relied upon to go Communist in due
time without excessive intervention from
Mother China.

rat. Cassell. 17s. 9d.
The Venetian Affair. Helen Maclnnes.
Collins. 265.
The Two Faces of January. Patricia
Highsmith. Heinemann. 265.
IV/fR Monsarrat dramatises a modern
social problem against a background
that is familiar to his readers —the Liver-
pool dockside. And familiar too are such
characters as Captain Blacklock, a prac-
tical man of the sea, who has progressed
from freighters to command the Good
Hope, a gleaming white luxury liner
bound for New York, then a Caribbean
cruise. He knows he can handle ordi-
nary discipline and seamanship, but is
doubtful about passengers and some of
the crew. Right now the stewards are
threatening to walk off two hours before
sailing, with a cooked-up grievance.
Their leader, Vic Swann, a scrawny,
bored product of prosperity, looking for
a soft job with hard cash, is deaf to
the protests of his uncle, a senior steward,
one of the old school who has seen real
hard times; he listens instead to a dock-
side troublemaker whom even the union
will not own. When challenged by the
straight-talking captain, Vic is incredibly
insolent. Ultimately, the lordly chair-
man of the line, present as passenger,
resolves the problem in verbal battle
with Vic, leaving the captain silenced
between arrogance and insolence.
This is an explicit and angering docu-
mentary of the times in which tension
mounts to a positive and credible con-
clusion. Mr Monsarrat has an out-
standing skill for creating characters.
Tension of a different kind builds in
‘'The Venetian Affair”. Helen Mac-
lnnes is an experienced traveller who be-
gins her spy thriller in New York, takes
it to Paris, and develops it in Venice to
an intensely exciting drama of danger
and intrigue. A network of intelligence
agents, mostly American highly-trained
professionals with one or two attractive
amateurs accidentally recruited, are on
the trail of a ruthless Communist agent
whose little game is triggering off
assassinations. This time he plans to
eliminate de Gaulle, and lay the blame
on the American Government. An un-
suspecting drama critic of the New York
“Chronicle”, on holiday in Paris, be-
comes inadvertently involved in the ela-
borate scheme, and also with a very
beautiful accomplice. There are no real
surprises, but the plot, loosely and enter-
tainingly woven, gathers exciting momen-
tum as it hurtles to its climax in a
palazzo on the Grand Canal.
“The Two Faces of January” combines


travel and thrills in a less conventional
manner. Miss Highsmith analyses per-
sonalities, using the bitter and resentful,
the violent, the shoddy and the impor-
tunate to create her plot. Chester Mac-
Farland is a wealthy American con. man
with a string of aliases, who, with his
pretty but naive wife, has come to Athens
on holiday while some of his shady deals
in the States are simmering down. But
it isn't long before he is again involved
with the law, this time for murder. He
is involved, too, with Rydal Keener, a
young down-at-heel American intellec-
tual, with a deep and bitter resentment —
he had hated his father, a Harvard
professor. Chester’s uncanny physical
resemblance to this father somehow com-
pels Rydal to pursue him, to shadow
him, help and protect him, then to do-
minate and ultimately to destroy him.
He seems to be seeking through the de-
feat of Chester a catharsis for his own
twisted emotions. The final disintegra-
tion of Chester provides the climax to
this rather over-contrived psychological
thriller.
JOYCE BURNARD
Growing Pains
From the Ballads to Brennan: Poetry
in Australia, Volume 1. Chosen by
T. Inglis Moore. Angus and Robert-
son. 355.
HThe panorama of Australian poetry is
A now complete. The publishing of
Volume I has followed close behind the
publishing of Volume II which covered
poetry in Australia since 1930. Pro-
fessor T. Inglis Moore deserves our ad-
miration for the part he has played in
the project for his, surely, was the most
difficult volume to make interesting for
present-day tastes—the period of Aus-
tralian poetry from 1788 up till 1930.
This anthology commences with a
large group of mostly anonymous pieces
under the heading of “Folk Songs and
Ballads”. The general reader will be
familiar with many of these: they include
“Botany Bay”, “The Old Bark Hut”,
“The Wild Colonial Boy” and “The
Dying Stockman”. Here, as might be
expected, the verse is direct, lively, care-
less, simple and sometimes entertaining.
It is good to see this less pompous aspect
of our literary infancy contrasted with
the far more self-conscious litterateurs
who, when resurrected by themselves,
make our poetical past appear more de-
pressing than it really was.
There are four other sections: —“The
Colonial Age”, “Bush Ballads and Popu-
lar Verse”, “Poets of the ’Nineties” and
“The Early Twentieth Century”. The
volume ends with the poetry of Mary
Gilmore which, according to Professor
T. Inglis Moore, has a “strength and
disciplined economy that place her
among our poets of the front rank” . . .
a large claim I find difficult to accept.
For me she is a frustrating writer who
seems, when given a casual reading, to
have the ability and power of an Emily
Dickinson, but a close study reveals con-
siderable thinness.
The section with the title “The Colo-
nial Age” begins with William Charles
Wentworth, and after reading such lines
as “Land of my birth! though now, alas!
no more/Musing I wonder on thy sea-
girt shore”, and the rest of Wentworth’s
poem, we must agree with Professor T.
Inglis Moore when he says that Went-
worth “was not a poet”.
“The Colonial Age” portion of the
book ends with Mary Hannay Foott and
her pelican—a particular torture that
many schoolchildren in this country
know well. But “Where the Pelican
Builds” helps to complete the historical
picture of Australian literature. Of
course, an anthologist confronted with
the task of arranging a comprehensive
anthology must deal with a host of
personalities, movements and tendencies,
and he must include things he does not
regard highly himself: he will be very
lucky if he is able to show good poetry
at every stage. Though we read in the
Introduction that “the poets have been
chosen for their merits in their own
genres, not merely for any historical
interest” much of the writing in this
anthology is only of historical value.
In “Bush Ballads and Popular Verse”
the verses bridge the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries with a nucleus of
writers comprising A. B. Paterson,
Charles H. Souter, C. J. Dennis and
Edward Harrington. Humor and raci-
ness are the chief characteristics, and
A. B. Paterson is the master of this mode.
The approximate “academic” parallel
in time to “Bush Ballads and Popular
Verse” is the group of poets under the
next heading—“ Poets of the ’Nineties”.
Here is found Christopher Brennan, the
first really important poet in the antho-
logy, and he is represented by a generous
selection from his best work. And
Christopher Brennan and John Shaw
Neilson loom as the heavy-weights in
this book. Shaw Neilson crops up in
“The Early Twentieth Century” with
well-known poems such as “Song Be
Delicate”, “Love’s Coming”, “The
Orange Tree” and “To a School-girl”.
The volume has been well planned in
terms of contrasts. The “academic” and
“popular” traditions are balanced satis-
factorily against each other. It is a
democratic and crowded collection, and
it captures the growing pains of a coun-
try’s literature. Some of the humor
remains humor today and there is a spat-
tering of real poetry, as well as the poems
and parts of poems that continue to be
embarrassing skeletons in the literary
cupboard regardless of the fact that Pro-
fessor T. Inglis Moore has worked hard
to give the skeletons respectable clothing.

Michelangelo
Michelangelo: His Life, His Times, Hi<
Era. Georg Brandes. Translated
by Heinz Norden. Constable. 95s
/T eorg Brandes is an art historian of
the most admirable kind. Whethei
you revere Michelangelo or deplore hin
(as apparently some do) this solid and
grandiose biography by the Danish scho-
lar, which has taken twenty-three years
to appear in English, will compel a re-
evaluation.
The biographer of an artist of Miche-
langelo’s stature faces rare and imposing
problems. Even supposing that his
erudition encompasses history, psycho-
logy and aesthetics, and that he can
arrive at some satisfactory balance be-
tween the uniqueness of artistic genius
and the movements and stresses of the
period, the demands made on sheer
eloquence in writing are still heavy,
Brandes has all these accomplishments
in generous measure.
The more one reads of Michelangelo,
the more unsettled one becomes. Per-
haps this is because we all start out with
the rooted conviction that he was the
greatest of the great: if the Renaissance
itself paid him universal homage, no
matter what he turned to, who are we
to doubt it? Yet simple awe before
genius is not very instructive. The great
virtue of Brandes’ study, especially for
the general reader to whom this work is
quite accessible, is that it persistently
draws the reader into the violence and
vagaries of Michelangelo's creative life,
It is not one of those reverent compila-
tions of everything the master wrote or
had written about himself. It does not
baulk at his manifest weaknesses —his
inability to complete work, his failure to
commune with his fellow artists however
illustrious, his deeply suspicious nature,
his half-concealed homosexuality—but it
does not dwell on them either. Brandes
writes truly in the grand manner: immor-
tal genius and mortal fool fall into per-
spective.
Technically this biography is an inter-
esting feat of organisation. It does pre-
sent as its title claims both the life and
times of Michelangelo. The man and
his art are both placed very fully in their
historical context. Yet it is the work
of Michelangelo which remains con-
stantly in the foreground. This is
achieved largely by following the
sequence of particular works right
through. Thus the Julius Tomb is fol-
lowed through all its failures, and in one
breath spans a good portion of the
artist's life. The man and the times are
gradually filled out as each work is ana-
lysed.
It is a long time since I have enjoyed
art history as good as this.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Lowering Export Costs
An average reduction of 10 p.c. from July 1 on all
comprehensive policies issued by EPIC (Export Pay-
ments Insurance Corporation) should be welcomed by
exporters. Anything which reduces export costs is all to the
good because it increases Australia's competitive position.
EPIC has been able to cut its premium rates only because
of the growing volume of export insurance designed to protect
the exporter against loss. Those who go it alone without EPIC’s
insurance and intelligence network can find themselves in
trouble, particularly if they are newcomers.
Would-be importers in various other countries often order
goods in good faith (and some not so faithful) yet run into all
sorts of difficulties when trying to sell their imports. It’s a
tough game and those who are already established do not
always welcome the new trader with open arms.
There have been cases reported where overseas importers
of Australian goods have gone broke trying to sell on a
“closed” market, even though their goods were bought at the
right price.
EPIC doesn't always get bouquets, for there are some who
don’t think it is necessary to load their costs with EPIC
insurance. Similarly, they are upset when EPIC refuses to
issue insurance cover on what it believes to be a bad risk.
But the money already spent by the Commonwealth in
establishing EPIC (which has links with other similarly-
sponsored groups in other countries) should be contributing
worthwhile assistance to the 400 exporters on EPIC’s books
who have a current export turnover of about £6sm. Any
improvement in that service is in the national interest.
By informing clients of export risks (including gradings
for various countries) EPIC is providing a service that possibly
someone else paid for with bitter experience. Its stream-
lining of operating procedures also is welcome, because no
one wants to be bogged down in red tape.
Exports must assume even greater significance in the future
with the Kennedy Round (and others) seeking to reduce tariff
barriers. So any move to reduce export insurance costs still
further should be pursued vigorously.
Japan in Automatic
Signal Tender
Qne of the tenderers for a contract to equip the WA
standard-gauge railway line with Centralised Traffic
Control is a Japanese company, a not unusual situation these
days.
Coal hoppers from Japan are to be used in Queensland on
the Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui project, it is understood, under a
payment-for-contract basis and the influence of this major
trading partner no doubt will blossom, with Government
approval.
The WA tender is to provide Centralised Traffic Control
for a 60-mile section between Bellevue and West Northam,
thus enabling remote control from Perth of signals and
points; also supervision of trains on the line.
The Western Australian Government has big public works
projects on its hand now, apart from the £4sm. railway line
project and the £l4m. enlargement of the freight terminal at
Robbs Jetty.
Big mineral developments, including iron ore projects, will
require some heavy Government financing, despite the burden
being shouldered by private enterprise for many of the facilities.
Western Australia, and other States for that matter, won’t look
kindly at any Commonwealth Government attempts to pare
loan funds this year.
Commercial Bills
Market Likely
/”|f interest to the share market is the suggestion that the
Reserve Bank eventually, if reluctantly, will recommend
a commercial bills market in Australia, presumably to be con-
ducted by existing short-term money market operators.
One stumbling block is the Treasury concern that an
official commercial bills market could attract funds away
from the bond market, thus weakening the remarkable support
of recent times.
If the Reserve Bank doesn’t control the new venture
through the short-term money market, it faces the possibility
that the trading banks will set up their own commercial bills
market.
But Australia must develop, and sophisticated money
markets are part and parcel of that development.
By exercising strict supervision over the new market, the
Reserve Bank will be leaning more and more towards the
flexible interest rate weapon.
Insurance Company Underwriting
Takes Heavier Knocks
fjPHE Bankers and Traders will not be the only Australian
A insurance group to complain about mounting claims during
the current reporting period. As a matter of painful fact the
chorus is world-wide, and has grown even shriller in the last
year or two.
More and more insurance companies lean heavily upon their
generally climbing investment income as they watch under-
writing surpluses dwindle.
In the year ended March 31, Bankers and Traders went
right over the underwriting edge, suffering its first deficit since
1952. All departments were affected, though the traditional
bugbears—motor vehicle, third-party and workers’ compensa-
tion—called for special mention.
Directors could find little consolation in echoing many
another worried board comment: “The prevailing upward


trend in losses is a world-wide problem, which is causing con-
siderable concern to the insurance industry as a whole.” Fire
business, usually satisfyingly stable, has lately joined the other
adversely moving classes.
The accompanying graph sets out all-Australia claims pay-
ments against premium income in the three most critical depart-
ments for 1961-62 and 1962-63. It should be remembered
that expenses and investment income are the two other impor-
tant items influencing insurance company earnings.
Last November, the chairman of the Commercial Union
Assurance Co. of Australia, Sir Edgar Coles, became very
specific when dealing with his group’s experiences. “There
was the disastrous fire at the Townsville Sugar Terminal esti-
mated to be in the vicinity of £7 million —the biggest in the
history of insurance in Australia. Furthermore, a considerable
amount of storm damage occurred in Queensland and in NSW,
and there were sizeable hail
losses on growing crops in WA
and SA,” Sir Edgar related.
He could not forbear to re-
mark that all over the world
“there has been a trend toward
the granting of wider benefits
for inadequate additional pre-
miums and Australia is not im-
mune from this tendency.” In
other words, insurance has be-
come a highly competitive game,
complicated also by greater risks
stemming from technical de-
velopments in industry, tran-
sport and accommodation.
“More and bigger fires,” was
the way Sir Edgar put it. Ris-
ing loss ratios also hit motor
vehicle and third-party (acci-
dent departments) in a similar
manner.
The mid-fifties seem to have
seen the start of the slicing of
insurance company underwrit-
ing profits, despite large and
continuous accessions to pre-
mium income. The big mergers
apparently take considerable
time to exert a positive improve-
ment in costs. Meanwhile, such
factors as commissions paid to
brokers and agents (and the
competitive wiles of these
gentry) are under close scrutiny everywhere.
Rates must be getting continuous examination, too. The
latest review of workers’ compensation premiums was last
week estimated to add £l3 million a year to Australia’s
industrial costs. Many insurance companies may not find it
possible to stop at this.
Deposits of C.S.B. now
Reach £IOOO m.
ThiE Commonwealth Savings Bank has just attained £IOOO
million of deposits. After taking 39 years to reach
£SOO million, in 1951, the second £SOO million has been added
in 13 years.
As a comparison, depositors’ balances in all Australian
savings banks totalled £2187.1 million at the end of May.
The CSB is ranked by “The American Banker” (by the way,
the only daily banking newspaper) “as the largest savings bank
in the free world”. Next in line are the charmingly named
Insurance Premiums and Claims
General insurers (i.e. non-life companies) all over the world
are reporting a decided upswing in claims. The graph above
sets out the last two years’ experience of Australian com-
panies in three particular trouble-spots: workers’ compensation,
motor vehicle and compulsory third-party insurance. Total
premiums from all classes of business in 1961-62 were £209.2
million and claims £131.0 million. The respective figures for
1962-63 were £225.6 million and £139.7 million.
Bowery Savings Bank, New York, and the Dime Savings Bank
Brooklyn. The nearest other Australian bank is the State
Savings of Victoria, at No. 10 position.
Presumably the traditionally recognised No. 1, the Post
Office Savings Bank of Great Britain, is excluded because ii
does not make loans to depositors, contenting itself wit!
lending to the Government!
Sophisticated Care
in Development
T atest report from Australian real estate developer L. J.
Hooker Investment Corporation emphasises once again
the heavy cost of “holding charges” . . . the costs of interest
charges, rates, etc. An un-
expected delay in the sale of a
big project can involve very
large amounts and dig a hole
in anyone’s budget. Debenture
interest charges at 8 p.c. on a
£lm. project are £BO,OOO a year
and can make profits look sick.
Holding charges often run to
11 or 12 p.c.
Bitter experience has
prompted the Hooker group to
attempt to pre-sell a project be-
fore undertaking the commit-
ment. It hesitates to buy a
property today for redevelop-
ment unless it enters into an
arrangement for finance, obtains
a purchaser for the re-
developed property and signs
up the major tenant.
This sophistication in pro-
perty development may mean
less profits, but it also means
fewer boo-boos. The Hooker
group is building up future in-
come along lines followed* by
some of the overseas property
developers, and it is not un-
common today to have a joint
or a 60-40 project with an in-
surance institution whereby the
institution may receive 6 p.c.
on its money in the early stages,
7 p.c. after a few years, and 1\ p.c. thereafter.
Hooker may settle for all profits over 7i p.c., or it may
share all profits over a certain figure. With rents likely to
rise in later years, the income potential also rises.
The main question with Hookers, however, is whether it
will continue its conservative plans or whether it will become
enthusiastic again and venture into new areas. Perhaps the
lessons of the 1960 credit squeeze will remain engraved in
company policy.
Seeking Wealth Under
the Silver City
Tracing the prospect of diminishing reserves in its existing
leases, Broken Hill South Ltd has obtained permission
to extend its mining operations under the city of Broken Hill
itself. It is described by the company as the biggest minera
exploration programme ever attempted in Broken Hill.
BH South says the prospects of finding a payable ore body
are promising.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Costs at the Cross Roads
Letting loose the stability horse
The Associated Chambers of Commerce
were certainly on the ball last week
in advocating an all-out attack on indus-
trial costs. To some this may seem like
trying to shut the gate after the Arbitra-
tion Commission has let loose the stabil-
ity horse. But the basic wage rise at this
juncture, when pressure on resources is
mounting all along the line and the wage
rise itself threatens to fertilise a number
of other noxious weeds waiting to sprout
on industrial pastures, makes counter-
action all the more urgent and impera-
tive.
Moreover, the increase in workers’
compensation insurance in NSW is a
timely reminder that increases in wage
costs are not the only route by which unit
costs for individual firms may stand to
be increased in the coming months.
Again, apart from the cumulative
effect of the basic wage increase as part
of it is passed on by firms which cannot
or will not accommodate it within exist-
ing price margins, the labor shortage is
bound to swell industry's wage bills for
overtime and over-award payments with-
out corresponding increases in output to
match them.
In addition, transport costs, notably
for shipping, have been rising, and it is
well on the cards that taxation could be
increased both by Federal and State
Governments for a variety of reasons in
their coming budgets.
However, the effect of the basic wage
increase on the unit costs of individual
firms is of the most immediate concern.
Unfortunately, in setting a higher floor
level for wages over so wide an industrial
front, the Arbitration Commission
appears to spare only a passing thought
for the various states of health of par-
ticular industries and the wide variations
in the efficiency of the individual firms
which compose them. These are hardly
mentioned in its hearings, where the talk
is usually on a global scale about pro-
ductivity and capacity to pay.
VT'et the Arbitration Commission’s
A awards have, in effect, practically
universal application in industry, and
this means to a host of individual firms
of varying degrees of efficiency and
operating in very diverse conditions.
It may be stretching a point to say
that the Commission’s decision to award
a £1 increase in the basic wage implies
that it thinks that this is about the in-
crease which an average firm, or the
majority of firms, can find within existing
profit margins. It certainly cannot mean
that this is the increase which a firm at
the margin can afford to pay, because,
being at the margin, such a firm would
either be pushed out of business by
having to pay it, or would increase its
prices by sufficient to recoup its increase
in wage costs, always providing, of
course, that it could do the latter in the
prevailing competitive conditions.
Yet the critical factor is the position of
marginal and near marginal firms. It
can be seen at once that, if prevailing
competitive conditions prohibit them
passing on the wage increase, they w ill be
pushed to the wall—and even over it—
leaving the field to the more effL'ient
firms which can absorb the wage in-
crease.
T>utting sentiment and social conside-
rations aside, this would inject a dose
of desirable rationalisation into some of
our less efficient industries. But things
are not likely to work out exactly that
way. It is much more likely that the
average firm would pass on at least part
of the increase in its wage bills and thus
lessen the discomfort of its less efficient
competitors. In short, it would be gener-
ally expected that most of the latter
would survive under a somewhat higher
price umbrella.
Indeed, the logical inference from the
Arbitration Commission's decision is that
there would be some degree of passing
on the increase in the basic wage in
prices. Otherwise, the Commission
would be damning all marginal firms,
whether in weak industries or not, and
thus helping to create a favorable climate
for takeovers by the more efficient firms.
This is also the inference to be drawn
from Mr Calwell’s injunction to industry
not to pass on the wage increase, though
the Labor Party is averse to takeovers in
any shape or form and also, it seems, to
any disruption to the pattern of employ-
ment which would certainly follow from
the closure of marginal firms.
At one stage in the basic wage hear-
ings the Commission was assured that
there was a healthy competitive condition
in most industries despite full employ-
ment, but it could not rely on that to
escape the logical conclusion that its de-
cision would lead to pressure on marginal
firms with the above consequences.
Obviously, also, marginal firms would
be the most affected by the inevitable
snowballing effects of passing on the
basic wage in prices. Any increase in
the prices of raw materials, components
and service used by them only magnifies
the effect on their costs of the rise in the
basic wage itself.
Equally, this will apply to the impact
of other increases in costs on their posi-
tion, as in the case of the increase in
Workers Compensation Insurance which
has been dictated by the actuarial experi-
ence in the industries concerned. (The
increase will cost £l3 million a year to
employers in NSW.)
In the coming year one would expect
a lot of these increases in industrial costs
arising from extraneous causes, more
particularly because of the diseconomies
which are usually bred in conditions of
full employment. We have had plenty of
experience in the latter, particularly
during 1950-51 and 1959-60, when in-
dustrial bottlenecks were the order of the
day; such things as unavailable or slow
delivery of raw materials and compon-
ents, keeping plant and equipment idling,
competition for labor, high labor turn-
over, inadequate staffing, industrial stop-
pages and so on, which usually plague
the industrial scene at such periods.
One refers to extraneous causes,
whereas, in fact, many of these will in
part derive from the basic wage increase
itself, even if its influence is difficult to
isolate. In particular the influence of
surplus effective demand arising in part
from the basic wage increase threatens
to have a pervasive influence, though
doubtless the authorities will make a
determined effort to mop some of it up
by appropriate fiscal and monetary
measures.
danger in increasing taxes to mop
it up is that these in themselves can
add to industrial costs, particularly those
directed specifically at companies, such
as payroll tax and the company tax itself.
The squeeze on industrial profit mar-
gins looks to be a telling argument
against increasing company tax, though
by August the Treasurer may be arguing
that the high level of company income
in 1963-64, which was almost unaffected
by the basic wage increase, is altogether
too bountiful a swag to let by without a
bigger dip in the Budget.
On the other hand, in an effort to re-
duce the possibility of passing on the
basic wage increase in prices, it would be
a good idea to reduce payroll tax which,
because it is paid on wage bills, not pro-
fits, bears particularly heavily on mar-
ginal firms.
At this stage of the investment race it
doesn't seem a good idea to throw further
hostages to industrial investment by
granting higher depreciation allowances
to assist company profit margins on the
lines suggested in one quarter last week.


“CROESUS”
Mr Ricketson Blows His Top
Flexibility of interest rates , or not?
Tt is time Mr Staniforth Ricketson got
together with Dr H. C. Coombs for
a good talk. If such a meeting could be
arranged, “Croesus” would be happy to
be a fly on the wall.
One simply cannot believe that Mr
Ricketson really believes all the nasty
things he has been saying about the
Reserve Bank and the monetary authori-
ties in his recent chairman’s addresses
to Capel Court Investment companies.
In his address to National Reliance
Investment shareholders last week, he
went a good deal further than usual in
his criticism of official monetary policy
and dragged up extraneous arguments
which nobody without a chip on his
shoulder would make public currency.
Let us get some of the extraneous
charges out of the way first. Mr Ricket-
son accuses the authorities of excessive
caution. He says they have “perhaps, a
preference for coping with the less com-
plex problems of modest growth rather
than with the more difficult problems of
rapid growth”.
He draws this charge from what he
finds the lack of evidence from both in-
dustry and consumer spending that a
restrictive monetary policy is justified.
But he fails to mention that, even if
some surplus capacity does still exist,
labor shortages are a strictly limiting
factor to its use. Nor is the current
boom in industrial and public sector
fixed investment mentioned as a key
factor demanding restraint in monetary
policy at a time when labor resources
are fully employed and spending power
threatens to become excessive in the
economy.
TTn this showing, like his fellow deve-
lopment fireball Sir Douglas Cop-
land, Mr Ricketson seems to be careless
of the possible development of inflation,
though frankly I refuse to believe that
he is. His more worldly wise statements
in his younger days, even four years ago
in the 1960 boom, belie it. But so angry
is he about the restrictive monetary
policy which is aimed primarily to stop
the development of inflation that any-
thing will do to chastise the Reserve
Bank.
Thus to him it seems meaningless for
the Commonwealth Government to seek
Australian participation in such ventures
as the Gove aluminium project and “at
the same time pursue through the
Reserve Bank a course which could
actually hinder the provision of local
capital”.
To most people this will seem to be
going altogether too far. But he goes
much further. “At the time,” he says,
“it appeared that overseas organisations
and equity investors appreciated more
fully the essential need for the develop-
ment of the Australian economy than
the monetary authorities themselves.”
Strange, isn’t it, that in 1960, when
the monetary authorities were not as
alert to the inflation possibilities as early
as they have proved to be this year,
Mr Ricketson was admonishing equity
investors for mortgaging eternity, and
overseas capital for its speculative
interest in the booming economy here,
while at the same time he was casti-
gating the authorities for their laissez
faire attitude!
/Getting down to Mr Ricketson’s basic
complaint against the Reserve Bank
and the restrictive monetary policy: It
appears that in March this year, some
weeks before the Reserve Bank sold
bonds heavily in the market to lever up
interest rates, somebody from the Re-
serve Bank whispered to somebody in
the short-term money market that its
policy was to maintain stability in
interest rates.
This tip must have surprised the
money market dealers, because Dr
Coombs stated precisely the opposite in
the Reserve Bank’s annual report last
year that is, he was happy in his
flirtation with a flexible interest rate
policy in April last year and intended to
keep the romance going, presumably, to
the altar.
Mr Ricketson’s tip was that it was all
off, so he was naturally surprised that,
by his moves to increase interest rates a
few weeks later in time for stiffer terms
for the May loan, Dr Coombs showed
it was still very much on.
The unkindest cut, according to him,
was that the bonds which Dr Coombs
obliged the market to take when he
allowed them to lift the ceilings of their
combined operations by £25 million to
£lBO million, were precisely those sought
out by the authorities for the heaviest
selling to get interest rates up.
To Mr Ricketson the loss entailed by
this in the book value of the bonds held
by his short-term money market coni
pany must have revived awful memories
of the occasion in the early 1950 s whet
J. B. Were and Son, his broking firm
was left holding the biggest under
writing baby of all time in Australia as
a result of the authorities raising the
bond rate by i p.c. during the period of
subscription to a semi-Government loan
underwritten by the firm.
Now, if the Reserve Bank did give
this tip to the market it was very, very
naughty to have acted contrary to it,
though the action in levering up interest
rates for the May loan was quite correct,
But it could well be that the Reserve
Bank’s say-so, whatever it was, was
interpreted too literally as applying to
short-term rather than long-term possi-
bilities.
TT would be silly for a central bank at
any time to give positive short-term
assurances to money market dealers on
its likely actions in the interest rate field,;
just as in my view it would be
ridiculous for such a bank charged with
the task of monetary management to
underwrite any particular level of bond
prices.
However, it is surprising to find Mr
Ricketson saying that the rise in interest
rates in April cost the short-term money
market such and such a sum—actually
from £700,000 to £1 million—because
by this time the short-term money
market companies must be inured to the
fact that changes in the book value of
their bond holdings are part and parcel
of their business seen in the context of
a flexible monetary policy.
Even if bonds are the money market’s
only stock-in-trade, in their case there is
no justification at all for construing such
fluctuations in the market prices of their
bond portfolios as entailing either profits
or losses.
In not allowing the short-term money
market to grow fast enough (in his view)
Mr Ricketson now quite wrongly (in my
view) suggests that the Reserve Bank is
responsible for the development of the
inter-company loan market. He suggests
somewhat gleefully that this market,
being outside the reach of the Reserve
Bank, is a thorn in the side of the
monetary authorities and trading banks
alike.
But coming only a day or so after the
Reserve Bank’s message, reinforced by
something from the Treasurer, Mr Holt,
that it was taking a close look at the
whole field of such finance and the
possibilities for creating a commercial
bill market, it was a bit thick of Mr
Ricketson to say that the task of im-
proving matters “now appears beyond
the Reserve Bank and must lie with the
trading banks”.

THE TRENDEX METHOD. The
market price of a share is determined
by the interaction of buying power
and selling pressure. It is the result
of mass market psychology. Although
over a period of years a true growth
stock will rise in price, the short and
medium term price action may fluct-
uate considerably. If you buy a share
at 25/-, expecting it to be around 507-
in say three years’ time, are you
happy when it falls to 15/- in the
meantime? If a stock is worth buy-
ing for growth, it is worth while buy-
ing it near the bottom of a price
wave rather than near the top.
Short and medium term price fore-
casting, on the basis of market action
itself is the business of Trendex. The
methods aim at showing what the
price of a stock is going to do, rather
than what it “should” do. The meth-
ods are fully described in our book
“Forecasting Australian Stock Prices
With Trendex”, which is sent to every
new subscriber. Trendex itself points
out, each week, current examples of
how the methods are applied.
BUY LOW, SELL HIGH: In regard
to the group of stocks listed above,
we have made positive statements in
the latest issue of Trendex. We say
which ones are headed upwards, and
which ones are going down. There is
no hedging. The time to sell is usually
when most people are keen to buy,
but market action shows that the rise
is over. So, too, the time to buy
is when hardly anybody wants the
stock, but market action is giving buy
signals.
It’s easy to say this of course
the thing is to actually do it. Trendex
DOES IT. When people ;were clamour-
ing for Rothmans around 90/-, Tren-
dex subscribers were selling it to
them. When people were shedding
Ansett around 5/- “before it goes on
the rocks”, Trendex subscribers were
snapping it up. It makes sense, too,
when you can see and interpret for
yourself the market action that points
out these opportunities. Trendex sub-
scribers don’t have to buy or sell
blind they can see the reason
spelled out in terms of ordinary crowd
psychology. It’s satisfying to win, as
well as profitable.
TRENDEX DOES NOT BLOW WITH
THE WIND: Trendex does not be-
come stampeded into changing its
stand by weight of published reports
and comment. Trendex looks for its
guidance to the market action itself.
There are few ifs and buts in Tren-
dex. The Trendex statements are al-
ways positive no refuge is taken
in vague generalizations. We are not
always waiting for the next report to
come out it’s too late then any-
way, as a rule. Trendex does not blow
with the wind. It shows which way
the wind is going to blow.
THE FOLLOW UP: Trendex does not
recommend the purchase of a stock,
and then conveniently forget it. Every
recommendation made in Trendex,
whether for buying or for selling, is
recorded in an Action Table, week
after week, showing any changes in
behaviour of the stock which may call
for revised action. Only when a trans-
action is closed out, is the stock re-
moved from the Action Table. The
reader is never left in doubt whether
to buy, or to sell and take a profit.
The stocks currently listed in the
Action Table over 100 of them
contain such items in the “stocks
bought” column as Ansett at 4/11,
Burns Philp at 85/-, C.S.R. at 64/-,
Dunlop at 29/6, E.Z. at 14/-, Repco
at 16/-, and Hanimex at 4/6, as well
as current buying recommendations
of course. The “sold” column includes
D.H.A. at 68/-, Frigrite at 17/-, and
Lend Lease at 18/11. These are move-
ments in the latest run. Some of these
stocks we have bought, then sold, and
bought again, and so on, for a profit
on each run. If it’s going up, we buy
it, if it’s going down, we sell it. It’s
as simple as that. And while Trendex
method doesn’t give the right answer
every time, the failures are few.

Asbestos Cement Finds Wide Usage
Production once again on the increase
llfiTH sales and production increasing,
" Australian asbestos cement produ-
cers seem to be overcoming a lapse they
experienced in 1961-62 when new
housing, a most important market, de-
creased because of credit restrictions.
Although asbestos cement’s share of
the market as a' material for external
walls has declined, it is finding uses in
other areas such as industrial roofing
and in the interiors of homes.
Production of asbestos cement sheets
for the first quarter of 1964 stood at
6750 square yards, 441 square yards
better than the corresponding period in
1963. Based on the percentage increase
in the first three months, the year’s out-
put could almost reach the 1960-61 re-
cord level of 29,759 square yards. From
that, production subsided to 26,862
square yards in 1961-62 and recovered
slightly the next year to 27,700 square
yards.
The Federal Government's housing
savings subsidy of a maximum £250 will
give manufacturers plenty of orders and,
when the guaranteed housing loan be-
comes reality, production will increase
still further. The opinion held by the
two public companies in the field, James
Hardie Asbestos Ltd and Wunderlich
Ltd, is that the public will buy asbestos
cement in greater quantities. The
Government subsidy (which will allow
people to afford relatively dearer build-
ing materials) will not necessarily cause
any decline in sales.
While asbestos cement seems to be the
most popular of all building materials for
external walls, it is losing ground in this
field. According to figures from the
Commonwealth Statistician, in 1957-58
im-NSW, a total of 5571 houses
vtith brick, brick-veneer, stone
or concrete external walls was
completed; 7976 used wood
and 11,529 used asbestos
cement.
Use of asbestos cement
reached a peak in 1959-60
when 14,125 houses in NSW
were completed using it for ex-
ternal walls. In the same year
6340 houses using brick, stone
or concrete and 9044 using
wood were completed. A year
later asbestos cement dropped
in its share of the market
although it was a record year
for housing completions.
Latest figures available show
that for the 1963 calendar year
Asbestos cement has gained firm
ground in Australia as a building
material. Although its popularity
as an external cladder has declined,
it has made it up in other areas.
The range of products now avail-
able would stagger Ludwig Hats-
chek, the Austrian who is credited
with the first successful production
of it in 1899, and it is this diversity
which has made it as important as
it is today. Not only is it used for
building, but also for irrigation and
reticulation. Research may find
other uses.
10,105 houses using asbestos cement,
6051 using wood and 8966 using brick,
stone or concrete were completed in
NSW.
Apart from being available in sheet
form asbestos cement also comes shaped
like weatherboard for external use and
covered with plastic for interior use. It
is widely used for fencing and roofing.
It is also finding wide use as spandrels,
the fill-in colored squares on modern
concrete and glass commercial buildings.
A Sydney architect said asbestos
cement was becoming more widely used,
but criticised some local councils on
their refusal to allow asbestos cement
houses within their municipality. “Per-
haps they were justified years ago when
the only asbestos cement available was
in flat sheets, but now that it comes in
a wide range of shapes their thinking is
outdated and unfair,” he said.
Asbestos cement as a building material
today enjoys a better position than it
did ten or even five years ago. Its two
chief selling points—resistance to fire
and white ants—which give it superiority
over weatherboard, have been included
naturally in lines which resemble timber
both in handling and visual qualities.
Today it is hard to pick an asbestos-
cement-clad home from one built of
weatherboard. With modern home de-
signs now available a swing from tra-
ditional building materials—brick and
timber—back to asbestos cement could
be likely because of the varied effects
that can be achieved.
Asbestos cement is not only used in
sheet form. Both James Hardie and
Wunderlich make asbestos cement pipes.
Wunderlich, which joined forces with
Humes Ltd in a £3 million venture to
make and market pipes, so far has not
fared very well. Wunderlich Humes
Asbestos Pipes Pty Ltd lost £297,436
in the year to October, 1963, to bring
the total losses by that company to
£507,265. Directors expected opera-
tions for the current year to show some
improvement but cautioned: “Prospects
of profitable trading are still some dis-
tance in the future”.
James Hardie, which makes asbestos
cement pipes in all States of Australia
except Tasmania, is constructing a pipe-
making machine in Western Australia “to
serve reticulation and irrigation require-
ments”. In New' Zealand it is building
a pipe-finishing plant.
The range of building materials with
which asbestos cement has to compete
is enormous. As roofing it has to con-
tend with galvanised iron (in country
areas) and terracotta and concrete tiles.
As industrial roofing it has
to compete w ith long - run
metal roofs, although it is still
very popular because of its
corrosion-resisting qualities and
because steam does not con-
dense on it. Its chief dis-
advantage in country areas is
the high cost of freight.
Inside the home it has to
meet competition from hard-
board, fibrous plaster and the
softer building boards such as
CSR’s Caneite. As a material
for external walls, weather-
board and brick provide com-
petition although, said one exe-
cutive, weatherboard is losing
popularity.
To meet this competition the

industry is constantly looking for ways
to improve its product, introduce new
lines and contain costs.
Australia’s requirements of asbestos for
asbestos cement production are satisfied
both by local mines and from imports.
Australia’s only blue asbestos mine, and
the largest asbestos mine, is at Wittenoom
in Western Australia. Owned by the
Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd and
operating under the title of Australian
Blue Asbestos Pty Ltd it produces about
15,000 tons a year, of which about half
is used for asbestos cement. The other
half is exported. Imports of blue asbes-
tos total about 30,000 tons.
For the first quarter of this year Aus-
tralia imported asbestos to the value of
£127,927 f.o.b. from sterling areas and
£445 ? 412 f.o.b. from North America. In
the same period we exported crude and
fibre asbestos worth £44,856 f.o.b. to
sterling areas, £7850 to the European
Common Market, £6 to EFTA, £3125
to the Soviet area and £15,150 to others,
making a total of £70,987.
Latest monthly figures available show
that in April this year we imported
£130,000 f.o.b. worth of asbestos, com-
pared with imports for April of last year
of £64,000. For the 10 months ended
April this year we imported asbestos
valued f.o.b. at £1,872,000 while for the
comparable period last year the figure
stood at £1,962,000.
Our export figures for April show we
sent overseas £92,000 worth as against
£34,000 last year. The reverse is shown
in the 10-monthly figure when, to the
end of April this year, we had exported
£262,000 worth compared with £597,000
for the corresponding period last year.
Asbestos cement’s applications are wide
but manufacturers will have to continue
their efforts to meet competition from
other materials. While they can do this
prospects are encouraging.

Options
rFHE rigid soul-searching at the L. J.
-*• Hooker Investment Corporation has
put the group on the path of strict
budgeting which thoroughly costs and
often pre-sells a project before it is
accepted. For this reason, budget costs
can be projected several years ahead and
the company can see where it is going.
With this in mind, the directors last
week took option-holders into their con-
fidence and drew a definite picture for
them so they could decide whether it was
worthwhile taking up their options or
not.
At the outset, option-holders were
warned not to expect dividends for at
least two years. Even then, in Septem-
ber, 1966, the directors would have to
decide whether to pay merely an interim
dividend for the 1966-67 year, because
there is still £2£m. of new capital likely
to be issued if 1965-67-68 options are
exercised.
By that time, the pastoral division
(which still requires plenty of capital ex-
penditure for development) should be in
a stronger position to give more solid,
backing to the corporation's finances.
Meantime, the real estate and building
projects division is expected to make an
important contribution to the overall
profits of the group.
Option-holders have been told that
profits for 1963-64 should top £360,000,'
which gives an earning rate of around
7 p.c. And, after due consideration of
all prospects, the directors forecast that,
profitability should continue at a greater
rate. Option-holders and shareholders
therefore could reasonably assume that
earning rate could rise to around 10 p.c.,
in two years’ time.
The group has accumulated tax losses'
at its disposal for some years ahead, so
it is in a better position if compared with
a new company floating off at par. And
the shareholder knows in advance that, 1
because of established projects, earnings
are already being built up.
But one hard fact remains. The cost,
of taking up shares in the company is-
the major consideration, and an option-
holder who pays ss. a share to the com-
pany is worse off than the person who
buys the shares on the market at 4s. 9d.,
even allowing 2d. for brokerage and some
stamp duty.
If the shares remain at the 4s. 9d.
level, or lower, obviously there is no
point in exercising an option during!
July. And, ironically enough, if the
shares on the market rise to ss. (before
brokerage) and encourage option-holders
to pay ss. net to the company to take
up new shares, the dividend commit-'
ment of the L. J. Hooker organisation
will be much higher on the increased
capital.
Existing shareholders would be better
off if no options were exercised and there
seems no doubt that, if most option-
holders fail to exercise their option, the k
market for Hooker shares could'
strengthen.
There is still a two-year wait for divi-
dends but the pattern set by the com-
pany is one of steady recovery, thus pro-
viding some encouragement to the 1965,
1967 and 1968 options which total
8,887,605.


INVESTMENT SECTION
Forebodings from Humes
Mixed feelings on share issue
Shareholders took the one-for-four
share issue announced by Humes
Ltd last week with very mixed feelings.
In fact, the report which the company
included in the issued statement was so
full of forebodings that they decided to
sell out, and the shares lost ground on
the Melbourne Stock Exchange.
One can hardly blame them. Direc-
tors said the dividend on higher capital
may (repeat, may) be 1 2i p.c. For the
last five years it has been 14 p.c. Then
they claimed the profits in the current
six months were not entirely in line
with their earlier forecasts and, as a
result, the 1963-64 result would not be
as good as 1962-63’s £943,587.
As if this wasn't bad enough, they
lumped in the statement that the new
capital works which the issue would help
finance would not be fully productive
for “some time”. Does this mean fur-
ther falls in earning rates? Still, at least
they were honest in revealing the com-
pany’s position.
Added to all these factors was the
10s. premium on the new 20s. shares
and the one-for-four ratio. An issue was
expected from the company by many
observers, though something more in line
with the 1960-61 issue, which was made
at par and on a two-for-five basis. Some
quarters were even hopeful of a bonus!
Then again, it was not particularly
encouraging to note that the ratio could
have been higher if the placement of
125,000 shares to be made to institu-
tional investors was made to shareholders
instead. These are going out at 84s. 6Jd.
Altogether, the moves will raise about
£1.9 million, which will all be used to
finance expansion. Although the outlook
for the immediate future is not overly
rosy, the longer term will undoubtedly
bring in bigger gains for the company
and, we hope, those shareholders who
have decided to be patient.
Gigantic Task Ahead
TTnless Melbourne - based transport
group Mayne Nickless can be com-
pletely successful in integrating the
operations of Metropolitan Industries
into its own activities, then the long-
term effect on earning rates is likely to
be rather dire. As it is, they have
already fallen in the last two financial
years.
On average ordinary capital, the
1962 result slipped from 28.7 p.c. to
25.2 p.c. Last year there was a further
setback to 20.7 p.c., and dividend was
reduced from 15 p.c. to 12i p.c., but all
this was after a bonus and a cash issue
earlier in the year.
Since June 30, last year, issued ordin-
ary capital has risen by £450,000 from
an issue of 10s. shares to the P. & O.
shipping group. So total issued ordinary
capital is now up from £l.B million to
£2.25 million (round figures, of course).
But all of this is not paid-up. The
P. & O. shares are being settled by instal-
ments which must be completed by
July 1, 1966. Only a nominal figure has
been collected so far and the first big
instalment was due on July 1 this year.
However, the full £450,000 will be
employed in 1966-67 together with an-
other £293,000 in shares issued to
Metropolitan which will actually enter
the books in the 1964-65 year. So at
July 1, 1966, paid capital will be at least
£2.54 million.
This means that profit for the ordin-
ary shares must top £508,000 in that
year to maintain earnings around the
current 20 p.c. —it was £310,000 in
1962-63 and, even if Metro’s profit of
around £70,000 in the same year is
added, the combined figure is still only
£380,000. Moreover, Metro directors
have said that profit will be smaller than
this £70,000 in the current year.
Thus, the two companies have about
three years to lift their combined result
by 33 p.c. if Mayne Nickless’ present
earnings are to be maintained. This
task, of course, seems quite feasible.
But to justify the merger, earnings
should show a rise by the end of 1966-67
to well above 20 p.c. so the task is
actually bigger than these figures
indicate.
In addition, these calculations are, un-
fortunately, based on three assumptions.
First, that no shares are issued for other
takeovers. Second, that P. & O. don’t
take up an option they have on July 1,
1966, of buying another £60,000 worth
of shares. Third—and most damning of
the lot that shareholders receive no
share issue over the period.
This last one is rather discouraging
for shareholders and the first two are
extremely unlikely assumptions. So, in
actuality, Mayne Nickless has a giant-
sized task ahead of it if future earning
rates are to be lifted above last year’s
comparatively low 20 p.c.
Silence of Monier
A number of large call options have
** been taken out on Concrete Indus-
tries (Monier) Ltd in the last couple of
weeks at a price of around Bs. Four
months ago the shares were 2s. dearer.
In the interval since February 29 when
Monier announced it had sold its Stan-
dard Portland Cement subsidiary for
£3.7 million cash, there has been a preg-
nant silence from the company.

Part of the bargain with the purchaser,
Commonwealth Portland Cement Co.
Ltd, was that Monier would have an
option to take up £500,000 worth of
shares (at the placement price) in the
projected Commonwealth Portland float.
While doubts have been expressed as
to Monier’s earning capacity minus
Standard's cement works, it is as well
to remember that the company an-
nounced a 49 p.c. profit increase in the
half-year to December, and lifted the
dividend rate from 6i to 8 p.c. a year,
only the day before news of the sale.
The question arises: Can Monier find
ready use for its surplus funds, or will it
consider a capital return?
It was precisely this vulnerable position
in which Ready Mixed Concrete Ltd
found itself, when, flush with funds from
the sale of its UK associate, it received
offers from that associate partnered by
CSR, then from Blue Metal Industries
Ltd, and finally a joint offer from CSR
and BMI.
A Confident Note
directors of Mutual Stores Freehold
Property Investments must have
plenty of confidence in the future of the
company to forecast figures like those
published in Melbourne last week. The
company is, in effect, a reconstructed
version of the now defunct Mutual Stores
(Holdings)—the name has been changed
because operations are now primarily in
the property investment field, not in re-
tailing.
To give the new firm a chance of
earning at a reasonable rate, paid ordi-
nary capital will be chopped from £1.68
million to £561,000 by giving the original
shareholders one ss. share for every
three held in the old company.
They have received considerable en-
couragement to date from the company's
various announcements —forecast divi-
dends of 6 p.c. in 1964-65, an assets
backing of 9s. a share, and a statement,
from a large English institutional share-
holder supporting the reconstruction
plans. But last week's announcement
was the most encouraging of all, mainly
because it included some cold, hard
figures.
The directors estimated that profit
in 1964-65 would be between £40,000
and £50,000 a year, thus producing an
earning rate of between 7.1 p.c. and 8.9
p.c.—ample cover for a 6 p.c. dividend.
No tax will be payable for seven years
and by then they believe that earnings
will have increased sufficiently to offset
the change. Earnings are expected to
rise gradually as new investments are
made.
But the biggest confidence booster was
the fact that the chairman, Mr D. H.
Hains, held 465,192 shares, making him
the largest shareholder in the whole con-
cern. In addition, the report said the
chairman's family were also large share-
holders. It is sincerely to be hoped that
this sort of confidence does not go un-
rewarded.
Warrnamhool Woollen’s Woes
HThere is every chance that the Warr-
A nambool Woollen Mill Co. will
suffer another lowering in profit during
the current year to September 30. Al-
though the interim report for the six
months to March 31 spoke of a “sub-
stantial” sales rise, the profit-to-sales
ratio was reduced by “sharp” increases
in the price of raw materials.
Unfortunately, the directors did not
go further and indicate whether profit
was actually up or down on the previous
corresponding period. The fact that the
interim dividend is to be maintained at
4 p.c. (full 10 p.c. was distributed last
year) proves nothing. Earnings last year
eased from 23.4 p.c. to 22.4 p.c. on capi-
tal and a further drop this year would
need to be somewhat devastating before

the full 10 p.c. payout was endangered.
As the interim reports for the last
two financial years have indicated rising
profits, it could well be that the omission
of a similar statement in the latest an-
nouncement augurs badly.
Whatever the position, it is unlikely
to improve in the current six months.
Despite an “encouraging” forward order
situation, the directors expect trading
conditions to become more difficult be-
cause of “severe fluctuations” in the wool
market, intense competition (one of the
company's continuing and biggest prob-
lems, mainly from imports), and the
20s. basic wage increase.
Crosby’s Hong Kong Link
establishment of a link between
Jardine Matheson and Co. of Hong
Kong and Melbourne-based William
Crosby (Holdings) should bring benefits
which will eventually give Crosby share-
holders a much safer cover for their 10
p.c. dividend in future years. In 1960,
1961 and 1962 the cover for the 81 p.c.
dividend was quite ample, but last year
the payout was raised to 10 p.c. despite
a drop in earnings from 14.8 p.c. to
11.9 p.c.
This policy was not as dangerous as it
may seem at first glance because, on top
of the £120,000 result, a capital profit of
some £63,000 was made. This compares
with only £622 the previous year, nothing
in 1961 and £1,373 in 1960, so the direc-
tors felt they had every cause to pass
some of this benefit on to shareholders.
However, the move was unwise in that it
created a precedent which could prove
difficult to uphold unless capital profits
continue at this level (which is highly
unlikely) or trading profits increased
considerably.
The recently-announced Hong Kong
link will help matters in the latter direc-
tion one day. Jardine intends to buy 14.8
p.c. of Crosby’s present capital (350,000
shares) and take an option, to expire on
July 1, 1966, on another 350,000 shares.
Quite large benefits could accrue. In the
first place, additional financial strength
is implied for Crosby.
Moreover, the two have operated in
parallel fields for more than 100 years.
Crosby operates through 11 companies
in the fields of shipping, travel, transport,
manufacture, insurance and merchandis-
ing to the building trade. Through Hong
Kong and branches in Japan, Malaysia,
Thailand, the UK and other countries,
Jardine carries on trading and engineer-
ing activities, a shipping and airline
agency business, insurance, property and
investment management and various in-
dustrial activities.
Crosby will undoubtedly share in the
increased trading activities going on in
the Far East and gain access to the
superior technical marketing know-how
of Jardine.
However, because paid capital in-
creases are involved in the deal, benefits
to the earning rate may not show up for
a year or more. When they do, their ex-
tent will depend on exactly how much
extra capital is created. At last balance
date, the figure was £1,009,200. Since
then it has risen to £1,409,200 through
a £400,000 preference issue to provide
extra working capital and finance the
purchase of the Harston Sensitizing Co.
This, of course, will not affect ordinary
earnings except that a 6 p.c. dividend
will be deducted from profits before they
are calculated.
Initially, the Jardine link will lift this
figure another £175,000 to £1,584,200.
If the option on the rest of the shares is
taken up, this figure will rise by the same
amount again to £1,759,200. A few
short calculations in round figures show
that to maintain current ordinary earn-
ings of around 12 p.c. in future years,
profit must rise from the present
£120,000 to £187,000 —by about 56 p.c.
This is a tall order, indeed, but could
easily be achieved in the long run if the
new link proves as beneficial as indica-
tions show. However, even then the cover
for the present 10 p.c. dividend would be
rather narrow, so an even better perfor-
mance is warranted.
GUT Surmounts TV
HUhe ss. shares of Amalgamated Hold-
ings Ltd show a yield of 4.1 p.c.
while selling at around 12s. 2d.
Most of its income derives from
Greater Union Theatres Pty, in which
it holds half the ordinary capital (along
with the Rank group of England) and
all the preference capital.
GUT has announced a profit of
£282,017 for the year to December 31,
1963, the best performance since the
advent of TV in this country. It will
pay a steady dividend of 38£ p.c. on the
ordinary capital of £420,000, and 5 p.c.
on the £500,000 preference capital.
Amalgamated will receive £105,500
from GUT, and, supplemented by in-
come from other investments, pay out
£112,821 with a steady 10 p.c. distri-
bution.
Gen. Cretls. Overtaxed
T ast week's preliminary figures from
General Credits, Melbourne-based
hire-purchase and insurance associate of
the Commercial Bank, gave shareholders
just cause to be optimistic about the
future of their company. In round
figures, profit in the year to April 30
rose from £240,000 to £258,000 to re-
present a furthering of the recovery from
the collapse which set in after 1959-60
and reduced the result from £495,000 to
£168,000 in two years.
In actual fact, the performance was
much better than these figures indicated
because the result was after a gigantic
lift in tax provision from £72,000 to
£206,000. Between £30,000 and
£40,000 of this increase is explained by
the fact that a subsidiary, Regent Insur-
ance, did not provide the advantage of a
tax loss as it did in 1962-63.
Most of the rest of the increase arose
from business written by another insur-
ance subsidiary, Automobile Fire and
General. This company substantially
increased its insuring of cars under hire-
purchase contracts stretching from two to
three years. For tax purposes, total pre-
miums over the contract period are re-
garded as income in the year it is written.
However, the company only includes
premiums for the one year in its annual
accounts although it has to pay tax on
the full two or three years of premiums
received.
This, of course, means that there will
be no more tax payable on any insurance
already written and future premium in-
come on this will go tax free. There-
fore, net profits must be in for another
lift in the current year.
So the current year should see a much
better cover for the 6f p.c. dividend.
Last year earnings were 7 p.c. and this
year 7.5 p.c. If recovery continues to
about 10 p.c. or higher during 1964-65,
then a dividend increase could be in the
wind.

Korman Empire’s Flop
Didn’t Hurt Them
Two businessmen in the Melbourne rag-trade are among
A the very few to profit from the folding of the once
extensive Korman empire Factors, Stanhill, Rockmans, etc.,
etc. Their achievement is remarkable as they were never in
the hierarchy of the organisation but, basically, just unsecured
creditors.
They are Messrs K. and E. Rogers, two brothers who own
Roger David Pty Ltd, which runs 21 retail clothing stores
throughout Melbourne’s suburbs, Victorian country centres,
WA and Tasmania, and K. and E. Rogers Pty Ltd, a manu-
facturing firm which supplies these stores. They became
creditors in 1959 when they sold their two companies to
Rockmans for £670,000, but remained in charge of activities.
Last week they bought back their companies after tendering
successfully to the Rockmans’ Receiver, Mr N. W. Buckley.
The price? Just £355,000. On paper, this looks like a very
handsome profit of £315,000 after four years. But Rockmans
still owe them £200,000 of the original purchase price, so they
have actually made only £115,000 they have no chance of
collecting the £200,000 as even debenture holders are, at
present, estimated to collect only £6O on each £lOO debenture.
Nevertheless, £115,000 is enough to set any two people
up for awhile. And, of course, they will undoubtedly have
made good use during the past four years of the £470,000
they received originally.
All in all, not a bad effort, especially as they started off
with only about £lOOO around 1931.
More Plans, More
Heavy Pressures on Resources

Gidgealpa, SA, suggestions of gas pipelines, and Broken
Hill Associated Smelters talking about a new zinc recovery
industry at Port Pirie, South Australia is adding to the list''
of big projects which will call for extra public works.
You can’t promote anything these days without adding to
Government facilities, if only because of the stimulus given;
to population, housing, rail and road freights, shipping, elec-
tricity, etc.
High world prices for zinc have prompted the proposal for
a recovery programme at the Broken Hill Associated Smelter's
five million ton slag-heap at Port Pirie, with possible recovery
values of £l3om. for zinc and £l3m. for lead—if prices arc
maintained.
With so many bewildering large-scale projects pending in
the various Australian States, heavy finance—both public and.
private—will be required. Increased Government spendings
already is earmarked for defence, road and other projects; all
of which add up to heavy demands for money, men andi
materials, with a consequent stimulus to inflation unless the
projects are planned with some order of priority.

of the cost of exploring an area twice the size of Britain for

12.5 p.c.
The programme of investigation will cost an estimated
£BOO,OOO, of which about £150,000 will have been spent by)
the end of this year.
Pickands Mather is the only North American partner that
has other Australian interests. It has rights to iron ore deposits,
at Savage River in Tasmania.
Marfleet and Weight’s
Calm Recovery
»
and Weight’s results for the year to March 31,
released last week, show another year of steady growth
and recovery for this unexciting Melbourne-based engineer;
and industrial equipment importer. Earnings on average
capital rose from 22.1 p.c. to 25.4 p.c. This represents another,
step from the 1962 low of 18.3 p.c. and another move toward
the buoyant 30.9 p.c. earned back in 1960.
Despite these fluctuating earnings, the steady 12} p.c. v
dividend has always been well covered. The prospects of an/
issue must be at the back of the shareholders’ minds
present, but, although such a move would now be well/
timed, it is very unlikely.
Marfleet has never been a great company for issues. The
last was a one-for-nine in 1961-62 at a premium of 10s. on
each 10s. share. Nevertheless, the 1963-64 balance sheet will
show reserves at around £380,000 and paid capital at only
£277,000 —a situation which holds promise, but nothing else,
of a bonus issue.

Beer Giant Shows Higher Earnings
Tooth shares in the “blue chip " class
By ROGER RANDERSON
VTothing came from last week’s annual
meeting to elaborate the succinct
and guarded single sheet that constitutes
the annual report of Tooth & Co. Limi-
ted, while the meeting left shareholders
still in doubt when the company will
make its next bonus issue—the first
since 1954-55, although they were offered
a cash issue at par in 1961-62.
Tooth, whose “KB” and “Resch’s”
beers and “Blue Bow” soft drinks are
renowned beverages, has held a predo-
minant position for more than 129 years
in brewing and hotel industries’ cater-
ing for a large area of NSW.
Directors give the impression of plan-
ning for perpetuity, as they adapt the
company's operations to ever-changing,
and often difficult, conditions such as in
recent years, relying almost entirely on
revenue to keep assets at high standards
of efficiency and to increase them.
The chairman, Mr R. J. Vicars, last
week gave his fellow-shareholders some
of the details of the large development
programme that has been in operation for
some years and which is still continuing.
Tooth's sales have been showing a
rising trend, and Mr Vicars added that
sales had continued to increase since the
end of the company's financial year on
March 31. This is not surprising as the
nation's wages bill is going up con-
siderably.
Investors rightly place the 10,819,650
ordinary £1 shares in this company,
which can always be relied on to pay a
dividend and usually a substantial divi-
dend, in the category of “blue chips”.
The market was disappointed when the
company reduced the dividend from 16
to 114 p.c. following the one-for-two
bonus issue in 1954-55.
However, the dividend has been in-
creased each year since then, except in
1961-62, when a one-for-six cash issue
at par (which contained a substantial
bonus element) was made.
Payment on June 24 of an increased
final distribution for 1963-64 of 74 p.c.
may reasonably be thought to indicate
that at least 15 p.c. will be paid for the
current trading year, which ends in
March, 1965.

This does not fully account for the
rise in the price of the share from this
year’s low point of 925. 6d. to the recent
price of about 104 s.
Investors also are taking into their
calculations the possibility that the divi-
dend is approaching its least expedient
high level, and that a situation similar to
that of 1954-55 is being reached where
a bonus issue is likely to be made.
However, it seems wise to make appro-
priate allowance in such calculations for
the possibility of a concurrent reduction
in the dividend rate, which, even if the
reduction were not so marked as in 1954-
55, would limit the extent of the benefit
from a bonus issue, at least for a period.
There is a real problem in finding a
scientific basis for valuing Tooth shares,
partly because of the paucity of pub-
lished information.
The 1963 accounts, compiled in com-
pliance with the new Companies Act, did
not bring to light much of the company’s
inner strength, which would have ap-
peared if breweries, freeholds and plant
had been revalued to figures correspond-
ing to present-day costs of replacement,
Directors stated that they had “care-
fully assessed the value of fixed assets,
having regard to the nature of the com-
pany's business”. Since they made their
valuation as at April 1, 1962, we shall
never know the total of accumulated de-
preciation to that date, although subse-
quent depreciation is being shown.
Nevertheless, the revised presentation
of accounts in 1963 enable a further £2
million of excess provisions in previous
years to be added to reserves —following
the similar additions of £6 million in
1954 and £5 million in 1958.
Income tax provision was also shown
for the first time in the company's his-
tory —and this is a key figure for the
purpose of analysis.

to Cesarine we have no worries about our appearance. Our
uniforms have been beautifully and thoughtfully designed;
they give us best protection and look wonderfully
attractive. And they’re laundered often, but they always come

. . . SERVING AUSTRALIA UNIFORMLY
CPB33
Tooth’s earnings are now coming to
be seen as much greater than they had
appeared to be up to 1962.
Stated profit rose by £406,402 in
1962- and by a further £278,214 in
1963-
Net profit was shown as £2,183,288
for the year ended March 31, 1964, after
providing £993,577 for depreciation (up
£2844) and £1,950,000 for income tax
(up £20,000), together with a new item
of £220,116 for “structural and internal
alterations to brewery buildings”.
One need not disparage the directors’
opinion that the £220,116 spent on struc-
tural and internal alterations to improve
working facilities and delivery manoeuv-
ring space should be treated as an
“operating expense”.
However, for the purpose of placing
the company's results on a basis compar-
able with those of most other companies
(if for no other reason) the table includes
this disbursement from tax-paid profits
in adjusted profit, which then shows an
earning rate on capital of about 22.2 p.c.
Apart from this, Tooth seems to have
provided a good deal more than was
necessary to cover its estimated income
tax liability for the year.
Adjusted net profit of £2,403,404 is
three-fifths of pre-tax profit of at least
£4,005,673. Income tax at Bs. in the £
(two-fifths) on the latter figure would be
£1,602,269 —which is £347,731 less than
the sum actually provided, and the differ-
ence may reasonably be included in the
year's earnings.
Conservatively, Tooth's earnings in
1963-64 might be placed at £2,751,135
to show an earning rate of 25 p.c. Earn-
ings might in fact have been higher even
than this, depending on initial deprecia-
tion allowances, etc.
Mr Vicars referred to some items of
plant expenditure such as the installation
of a new bottling plant, a second and
larger canning plant, a new bottling unit
and a new cask-washing machine. Stain-
less steel casks were progressively re-
placing wooden casks.
Such improvements in efficiency have
enabled the company to cope with rising
costs. Despite the April increase of a
half-penny a glass in some NSW retail
prices for beer, the company is respon-
sible for keeping beer prices in NSW far
below the level in other States.
Interests had been acquired in 24
hotel-motels, mostly in country areas.
Exclusive outlets for the company’s pro-
ducts now number about 1000, including
more than 630 hotels which it owns.
Although this is not obvious from the
balance sheet, Tooth acts as banker for
a large number of private hotel-owners,
and is financing many of them to refur-
nish and remodel their properties.
Such advances appear to be included
among “sundry trade debtors £9,578,300,
less £719,422 provisions” in the balance
sheet, although in the absence of further
details they have to be placed among
current assets in the table.
Cash receipts must be enormous, so
that discussion of the company’s liquidity
can only be of academic interest.
Impregnable strength is suggested by
the absence of any long-term or secured
liabilities to outsiders.
The present price of £5 Is. 6d. is equi-
valent to 255. sd. for a ss. share.
Disregarding bonus issue prospects, the
earnings yield could be regarded as about
4.8 p.c. (on the imputed 25 p.c. earning
rate), while the dividend yield from an
expected 15 p.c. rate would be about
2.9 p.c.
Investors at or about the present price
should not be disappointed, although I
should be loth to recommend paying
much more without information as to
the size of a bonus issue and subsequent
dividend policy.
Existing shareholders should sit pat
on their holdings, remembering that
Tooth shares over the years have been
the foundation for many private family
fortunes.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
“The Wales” and the Other Banks
Is “freedom ” fact or fiction?
Tn a leading article on October 19, 1963,
a certain financial writer heralded the
return of the Bank of New South Wales
to the 10 p.c. dividend rate. The market,
however, had upgraded this stock about
12 months earlier. Prices which (on a
comparable basis) had ranged from
about 345. to 40s. for some years started
to climb rapidly, reaching a peak of 695.
in January, 1964. With the recent call-
ups, there must be a number of investors
wondering whether “the New Bank Free-
dom” catch-phrase of 1963 is fact or
fiction.
Certainly, some bank funds may now
be invested in term loans. The average
overdraft rate was raised one-half of one
p.c. Treasury notes were issued at rates
considerably in excess of the earlier rates.
The banks can deposit funds in the offi-
cial short-term money market and obtain
a return even on over-night money. But
so far as the shareholders, or “proprie-
tors”, are concerned, it would be inter-
esting to know whether these additional
“profits” will be passed on.
For some reason, the trading banks are
not required to follow the full require-
ments of disclosure laid down in the
Companies Acts of 1961. This reason
was probably because the Commission
formed to assist the legislature in framing
the English Companies Act of 1948 de-
cided that it was undesirable to require
the English banks to disclose their “secret
reserves”.
In any event, the very nature of com-
mercial banking would still make it
difficult to determine what, in fact, was
proprietors’ profit on an annual basis.
However, over the last two years the
Wales accounts have shown a figure
which is made up of the following
items: — (1) Discount and interest earned;
(2) net exchange; (3) commission; (4)
dividends received; (5) other items (in-
cluding transfers from contingencies
account), less (6) interest paid and accru-
ed on deposits; (7) rebate on bills current
at balance date; (8) amounts written off
assets; (9) losses on realisation of assets;
(10) transfers to the credit of contingen-
cies account (out of which provisions for
all bad and doubtful debts have been
made).
From this it would seem that items (5)
and (10) would be the only ones which
might call for disclosure if the Ninth
Schedule requirements were applied to
the banks.
Furthermore, for some years now the
Wales has been showing in its annual
report a pie chart of the breakdown of
its “expenses” which, it would seem, in-
clude dividends and undistributed profit.
It will be interesting to see how these
figures work out for 1962 and 1963:

Deduced from
pie chart 22500 30 2945 2524 872
T>recision can hardly be expected in
x such a reconstruction, but the pie
chart can be used to produce at least a
rough series of figures to show trends in
certain expenses as follows:
Salaries, Other Divi-
£'ooo etc. Expenses Taxes dends Surplus
1958 11,390 3.830 2,350 1,580 284
1959 12,300 4,320 2,140 1,877 284
1960 14,180 4,940 2,320 1,975 272
1961 13,960 5,510 2,210 1,975 342
1962 15,930 6,560 2,945 2,524 872
1963 16,750 6,770 3,623 2,195 1,143
Unfortunately it becomes fairly clear
from the examination of the item “sur-
plus” that before 1962 the pie chart
applied only to the expenses of the Bank
of New South Wales accounts and not
to the consolidated accounts. Further-
more, the “salaries” series looks rather
strange in respect of the 1961 year.
If we applied normal standards to the
concept of net profit before tax a series
using the 1958 year as a base = 100
would run as follows up to 1961 inclu-
sive:—
Other Net Profit
Salaries Expenses Before Tax
1958 100 100 100
1959 108 113 102
1960 125 129 108
1961 123 141 107
Starting the series again with the 1962
year, we have: —
Other Net Profit
Salaries Expenses Before Tax
1962 100 100 100
1963 105 103 110
Naturally a period of one year is far
too short to reach any conclusions, and
if the information is still provided for
that time, it will be very interesting to
compare the two series in 1965. All that
can be said at this stage is that from
1958 to 1961 expenses were rising much
more rapidly than profits, but the posi-
tion may have changed in the last two
years.
It may now be interesting to make a
few comparisons of the five Australian-
based banks Adelaide, CBA, CBC,
National and NSW. The balance dates
are June 30 for the CBA and the CBC
and September 30 for the Adelaide,
National and NSW.
As the following figures for dividend
yields are based on the last sale in the
month the accounts are presented, com-,
parison may be valid only between those
with the same balance date: —

NSW 5.2 4.9 5.1 4.1 5.2 5.5 3.9 3.4
only surprise in this series is the.
A fall in the price of National’s shares
in 1960. In 1961, the marking down
could have been due in some measure to
the problems of its hire-purchase affiliate'
as in the case of the CBA, but there
seems little reason for the 1960 drop
relative to the two other banks.
The next table shows the adjusted
dividend rates over the last ten years
assuming that each bank will pay aj
10 p.c. dividend this year, as seems'
almost certain from the trends.

(a) Eliminating bonus content of rights issue and

(b) Special dividends paid.
These figures indicate that the CBC
and the Wales have over this period
shown approximately the same rates of
growth in dividend income. The CBA
and the National exhibit rates of growth
of about one-third of the Wales and the
CBC, while the Adelaide has shown no
growth.
Currently the dividend yields are as
follows:
Last Sale per £1
ord. capital
CBA 3.8% 53/-
CBC 3.6% 56/-
Adelaide 3.1% 65/-
National 4.0% 50/6
NSW 3.1% 64/3
If we accept that the Wales shares are
priced correctly, then the other shares on
the basis of past performance would
need to be priced as follows to give the
equivalent effective yield:—
Last Sale per £1 ,
ord. capital
CBA 5.7% 35/1
CBC 3.1% 64/3
Adelaide 7.0% -.28/8
National 5.7% 35/1
NSW 3.1% 64/3
No investor would be so dogmatic
about the prices, particularly so far a 1?
the Adelaide is concerned. However,
one can’t help feeling that the CBC
shares are under-priced relative to the
Wales, and that the National’s shares are
under-priced relative to CBA, but both
of the latter are too highly priced rela-
tive to the first two.


BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
One of the Bluest of Blue Chips
James Hardie’s plans for expansion
A dividend increase of 3} p.c. over the
usual 10 p.c. rate was the carrot
for shareholders of James Hardie Asbes-
tos Ltd who are being asked to subscribe
to a one-for-four par issue.
A profit advance from £709,088 to
£937,452, giving a new earning rate of
28.1 p.c. on capital, for the year to
March 31, obliged directors to be a little
more generous to shareholders who were
looking for a bonus rather than a cash
issue.
However, with the 20s. shares selling
last at £8 2s. 6d. when the books closed
for dividend and rights entitlements,
there was a strong bonus element in the
par issue.
The accounts drawn up for March 31,
1964, showed a working capital ratio of
1.86 to 1.0, and amongst current assets
were £1,848,600 in short term deposits.
The chairman pointed out in his annual
review that when final dividends, tax,
and payments for raw materials and
other seasonal expenses were made,
most of the accumulated funds at balance
date would be absorbed.
The issue, and allotment of 36,273
20s. shares to the company’s retirement
fund will raise £869,018 and bring paid
capital to £4.2 million.
Products of the group are asbestos
cement building materials; Fibrolite
pressure pipes for water supply, irriga-
tion and reticulation; Fibrolite electrical
conduit; Hardibestos “Five Star”,
“Ferodo” and “Safety Circle” friction
materials; and thermal insulation mater-
ials.
The friction materials division now
making brake linings, clutch facings and
friction materials for the automotive,
mining, shipping, aircraft, agricultural
and other industries was strengthened
by the takeover in April, 1959, of Better
Brakes Holdings Ltd.
This is the only major takeover ever
made by James Hardie Asbestos, and
the only one for a share consideration.
During 1963-64 a small South Australian
company making asbestos-cement pipe
fittings, Irrigana Products Pty, was
acquired for cash.
In 1961-62 the company established a
new subsidiary, Hardie-Ferodo Pty, to
acquire the assets of the brake-lining
division and the capital of Better Brakes.
Turner and Newall Ltd of England be-
came a substantial, but minority share-
holder, and assigned Hardie-Ferodo the
Australian franchise for Ferodo brake
linings.
Fifteen acres have been acquired at
Smithfield (NSW) for erection of a single
floor factory, to which Hardie-Ferodo
production will be transferred. Initial
cost will be “considerable but should be
more than recouped from reduced pro-
duction costs . . .”
The company has numerous other
plans for increasing manufacturing
capacity. Five acres of land next to the
Camellia (NSW) plant were purchased,
giving 12 acres in total for expansion.
An additional sheet machine will be in-
stalled in space previously used for
storage, and a major change will be
made in the flow of production.
Expenditure will be considerable, but
this is more economical than developing
a new site.
The leasehold property in WA has
been converted to freehold, and a pipe-
making machine is being constructed. In
SA, 15 acres of land next to the Eliza-
beth factory have been acquired for ex-
pansion.
In NZ the company is constructing a
pipe-finishing plant next to the Penrose
factory, and a 22-acre site was bought
in Christchurch with an eye to future
development.
Commitments for capital expenditure
totalled £601,099 at balance date.
Steadily increasing profits, conserva-
tively stated (depreciation provisions
exceed the amount allowed by the Tax
Commissioner, so that tax provision is
consistently higher than disclosed profit),
and five generous bonuses since the war
have made this stock one of the bluest
of blue chips.
The company made it pretty clear
that a 10 p.c. dividend was all share-
holders could expect in 1964-65, so the
microscopic yield of 1.5 p.c. now offering
from a price (ex rights) of £6 16s. Od.
discourages all but the most patient in-
vestor.
Prospects of a bonus are deferred until
the present expansionary phase is com-
pleted. In the interim, cheaper entry
than the present market price should be
available for those who want a first-class
stock in their portfolio.

ALLIANCE TEXTILES LTD
NZ Company Attractive
IThe New Zealand woollen industry,
mostly centred in the southern half
of the South Island, has in recent years
undergone a revolution in its structure.
Several of the small units have merged
into larger organisations and this has
greatly increased their efficiency.
In the past, every little woollen mill
tried to cover the entire field in both
spinning and weaving. Now there is
scope for specialisation.
One of the strongest groups to emerge
is Alliance Textiles Ltd, formed in 1960
through the merger of the Timaru and
Oamaru companies to which a third,
Bruce Woollen, was added in 1962.
A reshuffle of existing plant and the
addition of new equipment have resulted


in three specialised parts —worsted spin-
ning at Oamaru, worsted weaving at
Timaru and woollen spinning and weav-
ing at Milton.
The group has a 50 p.c. interest in a
jersey fabrics venture, makes one of the
best-known brands of hand-knitting wool
and has safeguarded its position as a
major supplier of carpet yarns by taking
up an interest in Bremworth Carpet Co.,
Auckland, a prominent manufacturer.
The results of this reorganisation have
been excellent. This was evidenced last
year, when after a very mild winter,
most textile manufacturers returned a
poor result.
Alliance, however, earned slightly
more, although earning rate on higher
average capital slipped somewhat. The
company is still expanding and several
times in its short history has raised fresh
funds (two share issues and one note
issue).
In their interim report issued this
month directors said that production was
limited only by a shortage of staff in
some departments.
Usage of greasy wool increased by
500,000 lb in the first six months of the
current year. Earlier, at the annual
meeting, the chairman, Mr L. H. Whyte,
had told shareholders that all mills were
working shifts and overtime to the fullest
extent, while an export drive was tem-
porarily postponed because the com-
pany could not cope with internal
demand.
Following a share and a convertible
note issue, the shares are now at 14s. 6d.
NZ, offering a return of 5.2 p.c. and an
earnings yield of 6.4 p.c. In view of the
fact that earning rates should improve
despite an increase to £800,000 in capital
(all ordinary), since the latest balance
date, the shares look very attractive for
both growth and immediate income

the biggest yet in the company’s recon-
struction programme. And it should have
the most dynamic effect on earnings of
all the plans as the subsidiary, K-M Steel
Products, is the one which has created
leaks in the group’s profitability, mainly
because of its steel activities.
Back in 1960, the 12i p.c. dividend
was well covered by earnings of 17.3 p.c.
But this position has gradually deterior-
ated so that, in 1962-63, a payout of only
8 p.c. was covered narrowly by earnings
of 8.7 p.c. The directors believe the write-
down will be useful for tax purposes and
enhance future prospects of adequate
returns.
After the write-down, the net assets of
the Brooklyn (Vic.) steel mill will be
bought by a newly-formed subsidiary,
Melbourne Steels Pty Ltd. The Clayton
plant, which produced fabricated struc-
tural steel, has already closed down. So
K-M is now free to concentrate on its
profitable production of metal building
products. This will be done by one divi-
sion.
Another division will take over the
manufacturing and trading branches of
Cyclone itself, thus leaving that company
free to merely co-ordinate and organise
as purely a holding establishment. For
purposes of tidiness, K-M’s name will
thus be changed to Cyclone K-M
Products Pty Ltd.
It is usually advantageous to create a
purely holding company in this manner
if, as in Cyclone’s case, considerable co-
ordination is necessary. The main prob-
lem will now be to eliminate the con-
tinuing losses of the remaining steel mill
at Brooklyn. The personal attention now
being given by directors in this direction
and the employment of advisory experts
should soon eliminate the heavy drain on
the rest of the group which has perform-
ed well in the current year.
Cyclone has been making metal gates,
wire, fencing and so on since 1898,
Its range of products is now quite expan-
sive, but it still largely caters for the
rural and building industries.
The company’s problems stem from
the acquisition of Melbourne Iron and
Steel Mills Pty in June, 1960, and its
integration with the subsidiary, K-M
Steel Products Pty. Cyclone planned to
spend £1 million at Brooklyn to give
Victoria its first major steel works.
Installation of a continuous casting
plant and modernisation of existing
equipment inevitably involved reduced
production with consequent loss of profit.
The severity of the losses was aggravated
by economic conditions in 1961-62 and
1962-63 which were unpredictable by the
company.
During the year to June 30, 1963, the
group was profitable with the exception
of K-M Steel Products, which, although
making a reasonable profit in building
products, incurred a heavy development
loss from steelmaking, materially affect-
ing the group result.
Profit has slipped from £507,864 in
1960-61 to £305,619 and £277,910 in
the two succeeding years. The last result
was after providing £220,205 for tax
and £422,057 for depreciation and
amortisation.
Last February the interim statement
for the December half-year spoke of a
higher group profit than for the previous
corresponding period, despite continuing
and accelerating losses from K-M Steel,
Last year’s reduced dividend of 8 p.c.
was confirmed by an interim 4 p.c.
In May the company declared that
its most serious problem at Brooklyn
was the shortage of labor. The reorgani-
sation required much more time.
Shareholders were told at the last
annual meeting that officers of BHP had
been most helpful with their advice.
Latest news on other sections of the
business appeared in the interim report.
MP Metals Pty and its associates in the
Victorian scrap metal business achieved
improved results in the first half of the
year. Cyclone Forgings Pty improved its
share of the land and garden tool market,
with higher profitability as a result.
Cyclone Double-Grip Scaffolding Pty,
which has plants in all States producing
tubular steel scaffolding, continued to
make satisfactory all-round progress. The

Richmond division of K-M (Metal
Products) was profitable.
Although the June, 1963, accounts
are largely of only historical interest now,
trade debtors were significantly higher
than in 1962, as was bank overdraft.
The company has a relatively heavy
burden of long-term liabilities including
1,121,536 20s. notes which convert at
10s. premium into 10s. ordinary shares
on June 30, 1966. This will increase paid
ordinary capital from its present
£2,910,589 to £3,471,357.
The 10s. ordinary shares now sell for
around 13s. 6d. to yield 5.9 p.c., and the
20s. notes for 14s. 3d. to yield 9.8 p.c.,
as they exchange one-for-one in two
years’ time.
Cyclone once had an excellent invest-
ment reputation, but this has suffered
over the last three years. The severe
write down, against reserves, of the
Brooklyn steel mill is an abnormal factor
affecting profit of the current year to
June 30. It will have such an important
influence on the company’s liability for
tax that no outside predictions about the
net profit after tax could possibly be
given.
Until mid-September when trading
results should be released, shareholders
will have an anxious time.

Canadian Record Wheat Crop
1963 Canadian wheat crop has
A been estimated at 723 million
bushels 24 million bushels higher
than earlier estimates. This makes the
1963 crop the biggest in history, 21
million bushels above the previous high
set in 1952.
The huge increase is credited to a 24
p.c. rise in yields and a 3 p.c. rise in
acreage.
Weather was exceptionally good in
most of the Prairie Provinces during the
growing and harvesting season.
A Good Year for Goodyear
Australian subsidiary of the US
Goodyear Tyre and Rubber Co.
earned 96 p.c. on ordinary capital in
the year to December 31, 1963.
The £300,000 preference capital is
listed in Australia, but all the ordinary
capital of £1.7 million is owned by the
American parent.
Profit rose by 6 p.c. to £1,632,828,
from which a 40 p.c. dividend, absorb-
ing £680,000, was remitted. (In 1962
the ordinary dividend took £1,445,000.)
Goodyear Tyre and Rubber Co.
(Aust.) Ltd plans to spend a further
£2.2 million on development, including
a considerable increase in productive
capacity of the Granville (NSW) tyre
plant.
Directors credit the record profit to
improved retail store efficiency, higher
sales and better use of manpower.

SPECULATORS DIARY
Riding on a Downward Spiral
" Logic ” needed for James Hardie and Malleys
Tust when the portfolio seemed to be
** on the mend, James Hardie decided
to go into a spiral downwards, un-
fortunately!
These shares were bought after the
profit was known but before the tax
provision was disclosed. True to past
form, tax provision turned out to be in
excess of the stated profit.
So far, so good. What happened,
however, to the support of the rights?
Opening at 1155., it took them exactly
one week to fall to 105 s. At this rate,
and assuming that the rights issue ran
for three months, the rights would go
out backwards. Somewhere along the
line, though, logic (as I define it) must
apply. Here then appeared a good
opportunity to buy a further 150 rights.
The reaction was almost as fast as
the fall, for one day later the price was
110 s. Selling both the original 50 and
150 rights resulted in a profit of £l6.
After allowing for the final dividend, I’m
holding the 200 old shares at a net
price of 1265. 4d.
The other heart-breaking fall of the
week was Malleys. They tumbled down
another 2s. This was just too much.
Everyone seems to have forgotten the
favorable interim report, giving promises
of a very good year.
With building figures at a record
peak, demand for appliances must rise
further over the next year or so. At any
rate that’s what the chairman of Kel-
vinator thinks. As far as washing
machines are concerned, Malleys and its
Whirlpool machine would seem to be
at least on a par with Kelvinator.
Whereas Kelvinator is at a record
price level of 255., Malleys has only a
few shillings to go to get to this year’s
low. Applying my “logic” again, a
switch from Kelvinator into Malleys
seems to be the solution. Taking into
account the 10 p.c. final dividend, Kel-
vinator showed a profit of £52. The
portfolio now has 800 Malleys shares
at an average price of 30s.
The only new company to enter the
ranks of the portfolio this week was
North Broken Hill. Metal stocks were
the rage last year and early this year,
but since have been very quiet. We
should see them stirred into action again
when North Broken Hill, Broken Hill
South and Mt Isa report for the financial
year just ended.
Four major factors seem to enter
into the buying of a mining stock
production, world metal prices, reserves
and, of course, the share price.
North’s ore production for several
years up to 1962 was steady at about
370,000 tons. In that period, the com-
pany was developing another shaft to
enable annual capacity to be lifted by
about 150,000 tons. This shaft was used
for about 6 months in 1963, causing
production to rise to 426,000 tons. It
has been estimated that production will
go to 500,000 tons this year.
Complementary to this increase in
production is the very real rise in lead,
zinc and silver prices. Lead and zinc
prices are both up 50 p.c. in the last
year. Naturally it remains to be seen
where world prices go from here. Bui
over the next few years it would appeal
that increases in world production will;
only just be keeping level with the ex
pected increase in world consumption.
Known ore reserves are equal to aboui
eight years’ current production. But this
must be regarded as an absoluts
minimum. The exploration programme
should ensure reserves many years
beyond that period.
The last major factor is the price,
The old shares have been fairly stead)
around the 39s. mark. Taking into con-
sideration the substantial investment
income, earning rate on total capital
(including the new shares) could be very'
close to 40 p.c. This puts the 10s. share f
in a very attractive light. It’s yet to
be decided what final dividend will be
paid on the old shares. Therefore we'
don’t know what the actual dividend
difference is between the new and the
old shares. I tossed a coin and decided
to take the new shares at 37s. 3d.
In an effort to clean up the port-
folio, I reluctantly decided to sell the
remaining 500 Aeron shares, promptly
chalking up a £67 loss. Aeror. will
probably turn in a good year and I will'
never forgive myself. This was partly/
but only partly, compensated by my sale'
of the 500 F. W. Williams new shares 1
at 34s. This transaction ended in a 1
profit of £36.
Transactions for the week were:

500 Keivinator, 25/- £627

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
The Big Question on Wool
What will the Marketing Committee recommend?
With the July 16 meeting of the Aus-
tralian Wool Industry Conference in
Canberra drawing near there is much
speculation among woolgrowers on what
the report of the Wool Board's Market-
ing Committee will be. But so far, no
one has been game to “frame a market'’
as they say on the racecourse.
There are four possibilities:—
• Retention of the present auction
system plus modifications perhaps;
• A reserve price scheme;
• An acquisition scheme;
• An appraisal scheme.
Now Alex McLennan, a soldier-settler
from Balmoral (Vic.) and a vice-president
of the Victorian Wheat and Woolgrowers’
Association, has tipped a type of scheme
which would be a compromise between
the existing system and a reserve price
scheme.
Mr McLennan is noted for being out-
spoken and, in the past, hitting the nail
on the head. It will be remembered that
he revealed to woolgrowers at large the
details of the secret meeting at which
Sir William Gunn (Wool Board chair-
man) canvassed growers’ representatives
on their likely attitude to closing down
the smaller selling centres such as Port-
land, Goulburn, Albany, Rockhampton,
Ballarat and Albury.
At Hamilton (site of the original egg
and flour throwing display against
Sir William Gunn) McLennan recently
told 54 delegates to his Association’s dis-
trict council that he believed the auction
system would be retained, but could be
reformed to include an element of a
reserve price allowing for a floor and
a ceiling. It was possible that it might
be in line with the UK scheme which, he
said, was more of an averaging scheme
within the auction system.
He said he had not the slightest doubt
that the Wool Board had agreed on a
change in marketing and was in the pro-
cess of working out details for a plan to
be presented to the wool industry.
It was also obvious that the Board did
not intend to make the same mistake
that it had with the promotion levy when
it had put forward its plan for promo-
tion in the face of considerable opposi-
tion from growers.
This time the Wool Board's Marketing
Committee would present a detailed plan
to the Australian Wool Industry Confer-
ence and the plan would not be presented
to growers until the Conference had
reached unanimity.
Mr McLennan would have been un-
likely to say all this had he not had
something to go on. Fie himself is one
of the delegates to the Australian Wool
Industry Conference.
He is one of the 25 Australian Wool
and Meat Producers’ Federation dele-
gates who, figuratively speaking, sit on
the opposite side of the house to the 25
Woolgrowers and Graziers’ Council
delegates.
The Australian Wool and Meat Pro-
ducers’ Federation have decided, in prin-
ciple, that they favor a reserve price
scheme. Therefore, it is just possible
that McLennan may have been given a
lead that something like the UK scheme
is in the wind so that reaction may be
gauged.
Probably the reserve price advocates
would go along with this, even if it is
not exactly what they want. They would
be prepared to compromise—up to a
point.
The UK scheme, or something like it,
would therefore seem to qualify as the
favorite for this race —except for one
thing. The economist of the Wool-
growers and Graziers’ Council, Mr G.
D'Arcy Chislett, is putting out a great
deal of extremely well-written material
which adds up to the theory that the pre-
sent system has worked well and there-
fore ought not to be tampered with.
While McLennan would have good
sources of information, Mr Chislett
would have even better ones —as far as
the attitude of the Graziers goes.
Hanging over the whole marketing
issue is the matter of voting.
At Hamilton McLennan revealed that
negotiations on this subject had been
going on for some time between the two
blocs —the Woolgrowers and Graziers’
Council and the Australian Wool and
Meat Producers’ Federation. He said:
• Originally the Graziers suggested
that only growers with 20 bales or more
should be eligible to vote in a ballot on
marketing.
• After talks, the Graziers agreed to
lower the qualification to 15 bales.
Beyond this they refused to budge.
• The Federation wanted 10 bales
as the qualification, but had to face the
fact that if they insisted on this then
the Graziers would campaign for a form
of multiple voting. (This would be based
on the theory that the bigger woolgrower
deserves more votes than the smaller be-
cause he produces more wool.)
Mr McLennan said that a form of
plural voting would “spell doom” to any
plan for orderly marketing. A 10-bale
minimum would deny the vote to 31,000
woolgrowers; a 15-bale minimum would
deny it to 45,000, and a 20-bale limit
would cut out 58,000.
If the Graziers insisted on plural
voting, and got it, it could mean that the
votes of 5118 larger producers would
equal the votes of 70,000 smaller pro-
ducers.
For this reason it would seem that
the 15-bale minimum might have to be
accepted—even though it meant that
45,000 woolgrowers would be disfran-
chised. It would, at least, be better than
plural voting.
Taking this into account —and it is
the first time any member of the Wool
Industry Conference has detailed the
voting issue—it seems obvious that the
July 16 report of the Wool Board's
Marketing Committee will be simply the
first shot in what could become a drawn-
out affair.
The Wool Industry Conference will
have to agree both on the recommenda-
tion of a plan to growers and the de-
tails of who will get the vote in a ballot.
And just what is this compromise UK
maketing plan?
Many woolgrowers will be completely
in the dark about this because the UK,
although a big buyer of wool, is a com-
paratively minor producer of wool.
One man who has kept in close touch
with UK wool selling in recent years is
Lawrence Simpson—one of the most
dedicated advocates of a reserve price
scheme and whose name has cropped up
in these columns fairly frequently.
Simpson’s knowledge of the UK mar-
ket 'Stems from two factors: his search
for wool statistics in the academic sense,
and also because he has, from time to
time, sent some of the wool from his big
Riverina property overseas for sale.
Simpson says that the scheme in the
UK is an acquisition scheme whereby
the wool is acquired from the growers at
a pre-arranged average price for a sea-
son. Different wools make different
prices, of course.
The UK wool clip is, broadly speak-
ing, of crossbred and carpet types and
has no wool listed finer than 58s which

Our advertising man has not quite grasped the point. We mean Armco purlins.
We explained how Armco Purlins save valuable time on big projects like
the Dalgety-New Zealand Loan wool store at Sunshine; how they are
ideally suited to new fastening methods like self-tapping screws and
neoprene washers; how they are fire proof, rot proof, warp proof, shrink
proof; how you can set the frames wider, because they are so light and
strong; how they are simply and quickly erected by the men who put up
the structural work.

is a Corriedale type of wool, or strong
Merino by Australian standards.
Simpson says that the UK scheme was
started in 1950-51 and, due to very high
prices in that year, the British Wool
Marketing Board was able to show a
profit of £l6 million sterling. Since then
a small profit was made in 1954-55 and
again in 1956-57. However, by 1961-62
all the profits had been worked off and
the scheme was showing a loss. This
year another profit was made and after
14 years the scheme is about square.
British woolgrowers are on a good
wicket because, although their wool is
not up to the same standard as Austra-
lian Merino, they have been paid for the
last three years an average of 66.5 d.
Australian.
Except for 1962-63 the UK average
price has been higher than the Australian
average which, says Simpson, is a great
tribute to their scheme.
It has some disadvantages as well as
advantages, he says. The big advantage
is that the same wool will make the same
price throughout an entire selling season.
The big disadvantage could be that it in-
volves a greater element of risk than
does a reserve price scheme because the
price for wool must be set “at market
price”.
Another disadvantage is that it in-
volves a reorganisation of selling and it
might be difficult to set prices for Aus-
tralian superfines.
These superfine wools, which are not
grown in the UK, fluctuate widely from
sale to sale in Australia, and arriving at
“market price'’ for them would be diffi-
cult.
Simpson says, however, that while he
believes a reserve price scheme would
be most acceptable to the majority of
growers, he, personally, would do his
best to get them to vote for an acquisi-
tion scheme if that is what the Wool
Board’s Marketing Committee does re-
commend.
all this one general conclusion
can be drawn: nobody can accuse the
people who want orderly marketing of
being unreasonable or narrow-minded.
For this reason it is to be hoped that the
die-hards who want no change do not
mistake this willingness to compromise
for weakness.
Should they do so the next round in
the battle (and it has been going on for
nearly 40 years) could be a dirty one.
Sir William Gunn emerged from a
temporary quiet in Berlin 10 days ago,
Attending the meeting of the wool
committee of the International Wool
Textile Organisation he said the trade had
made it clear that it would be opposed
to any method of disposing of the Aus-
tralian wool clip which denied the trade
the right to inspect the wool and put its
own type, yield and value on it.
There's no doubt about Gunn —he has,
the knack of coming up with the strong'
stuff at the appropriate moment. He did
not say it, and the Wool Textile Organi-
sation committee did not say it, but the,'
inference might well be that the all-
powerful textile industry of the world,
would prefer the free auction system in
Australia.
But if this is really the case, how come
the buyers go to New Zealand and South
Africa which have reserve price schemes?;
Sir William added that the Wool Board
would make its recommendations onl
marketing to the Wool Industry Confer-
ence in July and that the Wool Board,

He said: “We cannot make a recom-

users of wool to such an extent that it
would encourage them to use other
fibres.”
LITTER TO THE EDITOR
Woolgrower’s Charges
Against Board
Sir,
In your issue of May 30 you made
this comment: “If Simpson is right, j
then much of the Wool Board's activities
and of the IWS also are of the nature
of a gigantic hoax and a pretty expensive
one at that.”
As nobody has tried to prove the truth
incorrect to date, let me add a few more
details of the inaccuracies that were used
to perpetrate this hoax.
All the items listed below are state-
ments made by Sir William Gunn in a
Wool Board publication called “Report
to Woolgrowers”.
Page 1: “Immediately after the last
world war, prices were buoyant and
wool was going into consumption at a
reasonable rate, so it was not considered
necessary to spend large sums on pro-
motion. By 1958 there was a change
in circumstances. Wartime influences

had spent themselves and normal supply
and demand factors were beginning to
operate.”
The truth, however, is that from the
end of World War II until 1951 the
woolgrowers had the protection of a
marketing scheme (reserve price operated
by JO), and although the average price
obtained for our wool was well in ex-
cess of the reserve price each year, the
JO scheme had to buy in some wool.
The buy-in in the first year was greater
than the combined buy-in ever necessary
by both the New Zealand and South
African schemes in any one year.
From 1952 to 1957 the average prices
for the Australian wool clip fluctuated
between 80d. and 61 d. and during these
years the average that consumption was
ahead of production was only 24 million
pounds clean weight; 1958 was a year
of textile depression as total consump-
tion of all apparel fibres fell.
From 1959 until 1962 the law of
supply and demand did not operate as
in those years we had the best consump-
tion figures for wool in regard to produc-
tion since 1950 but our wool prices were
57.95 d., 52.06 d., 54.13 d. and 58.96 d.
The average weight by which consump-
tion exceeded production in these four
years was over 70 million lbs clean
weight. Apart from the immediate post-
war years when JO was “feeding” the
stockpile of over 10 million bales (over
2000 million lbs clean weight) on to the
commercial market, the four years men-
tioned above were the best recorded
average for excess consumption, yet the
average price was 55.8 d.
For the years 1952-1957 inclusive,
with consumption only 2-4 million lbs
each year ahead of production, the
average price for the six years was
72.3 d. (It may be wondered why
it is mentioned that consumption was
ONLY 24 million pounds ahead of pro-
duction, because it could be assumed
that it would only be necessary to "break-
even”. However, in 1951, when JO was
voted out, the 2000 million lbs of wool
had been disposed of by JO but the
commercial interests and government
stockpiles then held 50 p.c. of one year's
production as stocks. This allowed lots
of fun and games with the market but
stocks have now been reduced to less
than 25 p.c. of one year's production,
but there are still powers strong enough
to organise buying on a national scale.)
Promotion is designed to increase
demand, but, without marketing, in-
creased demand for four long years did
not help the Australian wool-grower.
So why another £9 million, without a
guarantee of marketing?
On page 4 Sir William Gunn makes
one of the most remarkable statements,
even for Sir William who is noted for
such things I quote: “The strength of
Japan on the wool market can be seen
from the events at the end of 1961.
Japan had a trade balance problem then
and had to withdraw temporarily from
the market, with the result that the
price of wool slid downwards as much
as Bd. per lb.”
The truth, however, is that if Japan
did have a balance of trade problem at
the end of 1961 it did not affect her
total purchases of wool as her consump-
tion for 1961 was an all-time record
(and still is); and not only that, she
increased her stocks from the end of
December, 1960, to the end of Decem-
ber, 1961.
Quoting from page 257 of “Wool In-
telligence”, May, 1962, it will be seen
that Japan's consumption for 1961 was
shown as 311 million lbs of scoured
wool and furthermore the consumption
for the second half of the year (when
Sir William Gunn alleges Japan with-
drew temporarily from the market) was
a lot higher than for the first half.
Sir William goes on: “This underlines
the necessity for continuing promotion
in Japan. To hold and consolidate this
market the IWS must have sufficient
funds to be in a position to do an ade-
quate job of promotion.”
It is regrettable that Sir William
should tell these things to growers to
convince them of the need for something
that is not necessary. Woolgrowers are
probably the most ignorant persons in
the world when it comes to any wool
figures, but we, of course, also have the
Federal Government coming in on Sir
William Gunn's fairy tales.
The reason for the fall in the price
of wool in 1961 was a vast reduction in
stocks in the UK and further details of
this (which, of course, Sir William does
not mention as it stresses the urgent
need for marketing and not promotion)
and later examples of organised buying
will be made available later.

It’s enough to set you singing the way this new
Holden takes to the road. After one drive, you’ll
agree: Great Highway Performer is the only way
to describe it!
Take the vivid performance of Holden’s new
engines, for instance. Their thrilling power is
far smoother and quieter, because they’ve both
got seven-bearing crankshafts and hydraulic
valve lifters.
And Holden’s Red Carpet Ride, gives you a
new standard of comfort, handling and respon-
siveness.
Holden* is the only car specifically designed
for Australia. Which explains why it gives you
such proved dependability ... so much real
quality. And why you get the best resale value
at trade-in time.
Exciting performance . . . lasting pride of
ownership . . . unmatched value. The place to
get the most of all three is at your Holden Dealer’s.
