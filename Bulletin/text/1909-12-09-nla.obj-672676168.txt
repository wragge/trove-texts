THE RED PAGE
Australian Verse
A Selection of Best Lines.
The number of entries in this competition
exceeded, expectations, and a good many of
the quotations sent in cannot be printed.
The largest number of extracts came from
the poems of Gordon, Kendall, Daley
and Lawson, in that order. Over fifty
contributors sent lines from Gordon, and
“Life is mostly froth and bubble, etc.,”
figured in twenty-two of them. If popu-
larity were a test, of poetry, the four
lines in Ye Wearie Wayfarer, of which the
one quoted is the first, would win easily. This
admirable quatrain embodies homely wisdom
in a manner resembling Longfellow’s
j Psalm of Life. Bracken’s Not Understood
has a similar widespread popularity. Verses
of this description compared with poetry
are as the. cauliflower to the rose, or
cut-glass to the diamond. For bodily
sustenance the cauliflower beats the rose
or any other of the blooms gathered by
Meleager, and for everyday use cut-glass is,
no doubt, preferable to diamonds. But we
were looking for—jewels, at any rate. “ Five
words long,” if possible ; anyhow, not'more
than four lines. Some limitation had to be
made, though we admit the objection made
by two or three contributors. Another
objector states: “The more perfect the
poem the more impossible to detach
any of the lines from their context.” As
a general proposition this is not correct;
but it is true in respect of most lyrics, and
the best Australian verse is lyrical. Never-
theless, if the lyrist has imagination it will
leak out in a phrase or sentence sometimes.
A petal is evidence of the rose, and the
power Avhich produced the tiniest diamond
is in the same class as that which is re-
sponsible for the Koh-i-Noor.
Remembering that many good poems and
some good poets are necessarily unrepresented
—the prize of 10s. 6d. has been sent to Dr.
J. McLeod, of Hurstville, N.S.W., for this
line from Kendall’s “ Mary Rivers ” :
And the splendid rose of heaven sees a sister in
the stream.
A consolation prize of 7s. 6d. goes to G.
Anderson, Wickham-street, Brisbane, for
the best all round budget, including this
from Daley’s “ Love ” :
Joy goes where she goes, and good dreams—
Her smile is tender as an old romance,
Of love that dies not, and her soft eye s glance
Like sunshine set to music seems.
Here follow some of the other lines sent
in :
CHARLES HARPUR.
.... Then hour on hour
Paused as if clotting at the heart of Time.
—The Tower of the Dream..
When up the unclouded heaven in starry sheen
Night walks like a gem-spangled Ethiop queen.
, —The Ideal.
[This bears a strong resemblance to the first
lines of a poem by Habington included in
Palgrave’s Golden Treasury.']
Standing alone, a study in itself
How Shakespeare’s volume glorifies my shelf!
For thence his spirit forth on mine has shined
Like a great morning on the hills of mind.
— Shakspeare.
HENRY KENDALL.
The moss that like a tender grief
About an English ruin clings.
The Hut by the Black Swamp.
But the old things were the dearest, and the old
loves seem the best.
— Coogee.
Then like a shooting splendor on the wing
The strong armed son of Kish came thundering.
—King Saul at Gilboa.
Oh, mother Nature ! would that I could run
Odtside to thee ; and like a wearied guest,
Half blind with lamps and sick of feasting, lay
An aching head on thee.
— Rest.
Flowing where the sunset flowered like a silver
hearted rose.
— Hy. Brasil.
... A singer of the dawn
With gaze upturned to where wan summits lie
Against the morning flowing up the sky.
—The Sydney Exhibition.
Lyrics with beats like the heart-beats of passion.
— Bell-birds.
Ah, let me hope that in that place
l Those old familiar things
To which I turn a wistful face
Have never taken wings.
—After Many Years.
And the day goeth down with a song on its lips.
—September in Australia.
A beauty like the light of song is in my dreams....
—Names upon a Stone.
The soft white feet of afternoon
Are on the shining meeds,
The breeze is as a pleasant tune
Amongst the happy reeds.
— Orara.
A. L. GORDON.
’Twas merry in the glowing morn among the
gleaming grass.
—The Sick Stock-rider.
Ah, time glides ever quickly by.
Destroying all that’s dear ;
On earth there’s little worth a sigh,
And nothing worth a tear.
—To My Sister.
No game was ever worth a rap
For a rational man to play
Into which no accident, no mishap,
Could possibly find its way.
— Ye Wearie Wayfarer.
, Life is mostly froth and bubble,
Two tilings stand like stone—
Kindness in another’s trouble,
Courage in your own.
— Ye Wearie Wayfarer.
The songs are ended, the deeds are done.
There shall none of them gladden me now, not one.
There is nothing good for me under the sun
But to perish as these things perish.
—The Rime of Joyous Garde.
I should live the same life over if I had to live
again,
And the chances are I’d go where most men go.
'— The Sick Stock-rider.
That couch was rugged, those sextons rude ;
Yet, in spite of a leaden shroud, we know
That the bravest and fairest are earth-worms’ food,
When once they’ve gone where we all must go.
— Gone.,
With a running fire of stockwhips and a fiery
run of hoofs;
Oh ! the hardest day was never then too hard !
—A Sick Stock-rider.
Look before you leap, if .you like, but if
You mean leaping, don’t look long.
Or the weakest place will soon grow stiff,
And the strongest doubly strong.
— Ye Wearie Wayfarer.
In the spring, when wattle gold trembles
’Twixt shadow and shine,
When each dew-ladeii,air draught resembles
A long draught of wine.
Lay rhe low—my work is done;
I am weary. Lay me low.
Where the wild flowers woo the sun,
Where the balmy breezes blow.
—A Dedication ,
VICTOR J. DALEY.
The far horizon like a sword’s edge shimmered.
Keen, gleaming, pitiless.
—His Mate.
Through din of wars invisible I hear
A Homer —genius is not gauged by mass—
Singing his I,liad on a blade of grass.
— Night.
All ballads of true lovers sung,
All stories of true lovers told,
Bring back the days when I was yoipig,
The vanished days of rose and gold.
— Blanchelys.
The players of the past are gone,
The races rise ; the races pass;
And softly over all is drawn
The quiet Curtain of the grass.
—The Players.
All lonely in a drifting boat
Through shine and shade I float and float,
Dreaming and dreaming, till I seem
Part of the picture and the dream.
—Years After.
In Avonaise, in Avonaise,
Where all is dead and done,
The folk who rest there all their days
Care not for moon or sun.
— Anna.
He shall have gifts—the gift that feels
The germ within the clod,
And hears the whirring of the wheels
That turn the mills of God.
—The Voice of the Soul.
A scented song blown oversea,
As though from bowers of bloom ;
A wind-harp’in a lilac tree
Breathed music and perfume.
—A Sunset Fantasy. •
Love is the sunshine of the soul.
— Love.
Hell were too small if man were judged by man.
— Questions.
From deeps of air to airless heights,
Lo ! how he sweeps, the splendid sun,
His burning lyre of many lights !
— Years After.
Its sound is like the rude
March of a multitude
To a battle-hymn. t
—(The Wind)—In a Far Country.
BRUNTON STEPHENS.
Already, like divining rods, men’s souls
Bend down to where the unseen river rolls.

For Art is the garment of Praise and the broidered
apparel of Truth.

The solitude spread near and far
Around the camp-fire’s tiny star.

She is the green bud breaking through
The winter of my heart.

Could we part the land asunder God has girdled
with the sea ?
—A Federal Song.
D. M. ROSS.
Like some long cloud surprised in sleep,
I saw an Island lift its head
A little way above the deep.
The Land of My Desire.
HENRY LAWSON.
Once I cried, “Oh ! God Almighty !
If Thy Might doth still endure,
Now show me in a vision, for the wrongs
Of Earth, a cure.”
—Faces in the Street.
The brute is a brute, and the kind man kind, and
the strong heart does not fail—
A crawler’s a crawler everywhere, but a man is a
man in gaol!
—One Hundred and Three.
Call no friends —I shall not need them ;
Call no priests—l shall not heed them ;
Let the bad girl do the praying over what is left
of me.
—The Alleys.
The soul of the world they will feel, and see,
In the chase and the grim retreat;
They will know the glory of victory,
And the grandeur of defeat.
The Star of Australasia.
The self same spirit that drives the man
To the depths of drink and crime,
Will do the deeds in the heroes’ van
That live to the end of Time.
—The Star of Australasia.
A Rouseabout of rouseabouts, from 5 any land or
none—
I bear a nickname of the Bush, and I’m—a
woman’s son ;
I came from where I camped last night, and, at
the day-dawn glow,
I rub the darkness from my eyes, roll up my swag
and go.
—The Ballad of the Rouseabout.
SYDNEY JEPHCOTT
Ruddy and white the chips outspring,
Like money sown by a pageant King.
r — Splitting.
Our poor present will,
Far in the brooding future, make a past
Full of the morning’s music still.
—A Fragment.
BERNARD O’DOWD.
Last sea thing dredged by sailoupTiine from Space.
. — Australia.
That each shall share what all men sow:
That culture, caste’s a lie :
That man is God however low—
Is man, however high.
Young Democracy.
A. A. D. BAYLDON.
The slow, large, wandering glances of the moon.
The Sphinx.
Meanwhile ’tis fine to live, to think, to feel
To be a fiery atom of the Whole
Body a-tiptoe budding into soul;
A spinning spoke of Life’s unstopping wheel.
—My Work.
The revelry of kisses bought for gold,
The jest and jealous rival and the strife,
A harlot weeping o’er a corpse scarce cold,
A scullion fleeing with a bloody knife.
Marlowe.
The night’s soft starry glamor slow withdrawn—
The pomp and architecture of the dawn.
The Coming of Apollo.
ARTHUR H. ADAMS.
And as I stood and watched, Antiquity
With all her centuries whirled in on me
Like a swift mirthless rain ! Within this pile
Of buried passions drowsed Eternity !
, —The Coliseum.
Still he spoke, but suddenly the lizard
Made a greenish ripple through the darkness,
And was gone.
—The Coming of Te Rauparaha.
WILL OGILYIE.
On the rim of the world the lightnings play,
The heat waves quiver and dance,
And the breath of the wind is a sword to slay,
And the sunbeams each a lance.
—Drought.
Ah, when Death’s hand our own warm hand hath
ta’en,
Down the dark isles his sceptre rules supreme—
God grant the fighters leave to fight again,
And let the dreamers dream !. . .
—Some take no heed.
And I love her beauty, this land of mine ;
And I love the sheen of her ferny coast,—
Her pastures green and her mountain-line—
But maybe and maybe her ocean most.
—A Song of the South Coast.
Ah, Father Time!
Their golden hours are few ;
And tffe arch of the rainbow is still to climb
And the fairies to find in the dew ! . . .
—Time and the Children.
And the meanest man on the round world’s rim—
Boet or painter though never he be—
Has seen for a moment with eyes grown dim
The light that was never oh land or sea! . . .
—The World Beyond.
A. B. PATERSON.
And I know full well that the strangers’ faces
Would greet us now in our dearest places,
For our day is dead and has left no traces.
But the thoughts that live in my mind to-night.
—Black Swans.
And he sees the vision splendid,
Of the sunlit plains extended,
And at night the wondrous glory
Of the everlasting stars.
—Clancy of the Overflow.
For the wine of life is a woman’s love.
To keep beside thee ;
For the love of Art is a thing above,
A star to guide thee.
—Ambition and Art.
FURNLEY MAURICE.
Stand by the fact and let the dream go by.
The painted sunset and the sugared word ;
Turn from the things that no soul felt or heard,
And learn how young men laugh and old men
die.
—Roots of Dreams.
Be triumph my reward, I hope it waits
Till iny last years. I dread that brilliant past.
Joyance will light the rudimentary states,
If God will let me do my best things last.
—The Artist.
RODERIC QUINN.
I’d give a year or two of life,
And count the giving gain,
To be an idle fellow
In the lazy land of Spain.
—The Land of Spain.
O ye may drain the wine-cup—
Ye shall but taste the lees ;
For never the vintage reddened
That brought the heart heart’s-ease.
— Forgetfulness.
Shed tears for them ! Nay, nay, no tears !
They yearn for endless rest;
Perhaps large stars will burn above
Their camp within the West.
—The Gamp Within the West.
CHRISTOPHER JOHN BRENNAN.
Poppies flush all. tremulous —
Has our love grown into them
Root and stem ;
Are the red blooms red with us ?
— Poppies.
JOHN LE GAY BRERETON.
“ Where shall we dwell ?” sayyou.
Wandering winds reply:
“ In a temple with roof of blue
Under the splendid sky.”
— Home.
MABEL FORREST.
Do you know the land of dream fulfilled —the land
of heart’s desire.
For there lies the story you meant to write that
would turn men’s brains to fire ;
There, hung on the walls of room-of-gold that
would make a sun’s rays faint,
Is the beautiful thought you meant to limn, the
picture you meant to paint.
— The Land of the Heart's Desire.
HUGH McCRAE.
A loose horse neighs at the night,
A housed horse stamps in his stall;
A swallow flutters with fright,
And dies at the top of the wall.
—Murder Night.
Flames filled the hollows of my hands,
Red blood rushed hammering round my heart,
Like mighty sleds when anvil bands
Gape out, and from their holdings start.
—The End of Desire.
LOUISE MACK.
March of shadows to muted music.
White gums waiting, we know, we know !
And we know, dear Land, that our desolate story
Has its hidden sweet and its inner glory.
—Land I Love.
BARCROFT BOAKE.
Out where the grinning skulls bleach whitely,
Under the saltbush sparkling brightly,
Out where the wild dogs chorus nightly,
That’s where the dead men lie.”
Where the Dead Men Lie.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
The brown boronia’s scent strikes
Memory as some old tune ...
—ln my Garden.
The gold pefpendicles of Heaven,
And the arctic pomp of God.
— The Soul of Clontarf Bill.
Where tremulous the earth’s green breast
Glows with the clamant life of Spring.
—My Epitaph.
HENRY WOOLLEY.
The arches of the firmament
His church-roof span—
He lies, his own white monument,
A man !
—An Explorer.
HUBERT CHURCH.
And the hurried revelry of the cataract to the sea.t
THOMAS BRACKEN.
Oh, God ! that men would see a little clearer,
Or judge less harshly where they cannot see ;
Oh, God ! that men would draw a little nearer
To one another, they’d be nearer Thee.
—Not Understood.
MOWBRAY MORRIS.
What the crown of a sorrow’s sorrow
May be, I know not; but this I know,
It lightens the years that are now
Sometimes to think of the years ago.”
Voice from the Bush.

Present.

Practical, Serviceable
and Instructive.
‘Sold for Spot Cash at
ANTHONY HORDERNS’ FAMOUS LOW PRICES.
Post Free, N.S.W., £3 16s. 6d.; Other States, £3 18s.
The Junior
Is a real Typewriter, built lor hard usage and to last
a lifetime.
The name Junior merely indicates small size and
extremely moderate price.
It is almost the equal of the higher-priced machines.
Does work as easily and neatly as the most ex-
pensive Typewriter.
Is the first practical, serviceable Typewriter offered
at a price within the reach of all.
- Is guaranteed for one year by the manufacturers.
The Junior Typewriter
T$ ideal’ for the Business and Professional Man and
Woman, for the Commercial Traveller and for the
Student.
In the HOME it is instructive. It is invaluable in
personal and private correspondence.

are necessary to master it.
The novice quickly learns the simple Standard key-
board, whilst the user of any of the Standard machines
has nothing to learn to operate the Junior.
The Junior Typewriter
Has regular Standard Keyboard which may be
operated by all the fingers of both hands.
Has eighty-four characters— six more than some big-
machines. i;.
Makes one carbon copy and writes in sight.
Takes all sizes of paper up to B|in. wide, the same
as Standard machines, and is built throughout of
hardened steel.
The Necessity
For a small, compact Typewriter, easy portable in
hand, pocket or bag, but sacrificing no efficiency,
brought the Junior Typewriter into being; a
large demand was the natural consequence, and at
the price, £3 155., it defies all competition.
The Junior Typewriter in the case is only
lOin. long, sin. wide and 2in. high, and strongly
resembles a camera.
Its weight is 41b., including the case.
It contains just 189 separate parts, including- every
spring and screw. The larger.'machines contain
about ten times this number. '
Consult our Price List
of Books for Christmas
and Leisure Hours.
Write for a copy, post-
ed free on request.
The Junior Typewriter provides interesting: work,
and will teach business methods, business forms and
business exactness to the ambitious boy or girl.
The Junior Typewriter is invaluable from every
standpoint for the teacher, the student, the literary man,
the professional man ; and for the commercial man it
affords a machine that will eliminate all writing troubles.
Every part of the Junior is made of the best hardened
steel, and tested severely before it enters into the make-
up of this machine.
All the material used is the best that money can buy,
and the most skilful of skilled labor furnishes the work-
manship.
All exposed parts of the Junior are beautifully
nickelled or enamelled, making- a very handsome effect.
The adjustment is as perfect as experience can make it.
The type alignment is accurate, and safeguarded by a
special device.
There is very little to get out of order in the Junior,
as it contains only one-tenth as many parts as the larger
machines.

THE JUNIOR TYPEWRITER— ACTUAL SIZE. PRICE £3 15s.
Size: The Junior, with carrying case 2in. x sin.
x 10in., is the smallest real Typewriter with Standard
keyboard. m
Speed: Tlie Junior can write 80 words a minute.
While the big machines may write more— the average
speed of an expert is less than fifty words a minute.
Durability : Built of pressed chided steel and gun
metal, no machine will wear longer.
Simplicity: With fewer parts—more direct stroke
—removable type wheel (most easily cleaned), the
Junior keeps in condition because— there is nothin >j
to go wrong.
Keyboard : Standard. There are six more
characters than on some of the large machines, and
the space bar is more conveniently placed.
Manifolding;: The Junior will write an original
and one copv. S > ee machines will do more. But this
is enough for most business needs.
Alignment : So perfectly designed that it is not
likely to get out of order.
Paper Size : Standard S.'.in. paper, same as any
other high-grade machine.
Price: £3 15s. Postage extra.
Ease of Operation
Is one of the greatest recommendations of the
Junior Typewriter.
At Home, place it on the table or desk, and when
you are finished slip it into the drawer.
On the Train or Boat, place it on your lap.
At the Hotel, place it on the desk in the writing-
room.
Everywhere, for every use requiring compactness,
convenience and economy of space, the Junior
Typewriter is invaluable.
The Junior Typewriter
Will write up to 80 words a minute.
Some other machines have a capacity of 150 words
a minute when operated bv an expert, but the
average operator only writes about 50 words a minute.
This brings the Junior within the range of prac-
tical work for business uses.
If you have an office, with an expert operator, and
don t mind spending ±25 for the machine, and so
much per week for the operat >r, these pages mav not
interest you. J
If not, you can purchase a Junior Typewriter for
155., and, instead of writing with a pen, you mav
typewrite with much less effort and no cost further'
And your letters will look as well as the best busi-
ness letters turned out by the largest offices.
The Junior
Will do beautiful, clean-looking work, which cannot
be distinguished from the work of the larger machines.
Will furnish one carbon copy.
Will write plainly and rapidly business letters
social letters, school exercises, etc.
Will write plainly and legibly the work of authors
the sermons of preachers, the briefs of lawvers— to
whom legibility is absolutely essential.
In the Home
Every member of a family can use the Junior Type-
writer. Anyone with business experience and train-
ing will readil.v appreciate its value.
The WIPE will find that the Junior will make
pleasant what was formerly tedious and uninviting-
social letters, besides orders to tradesmen.
The SON will find entertainment and instruction in
operating this fascinating machine. It will make
him more careful as to details, and promote tidiness
and accuracy.
The DAUGHTER will take naturally to the
Junior, as most girls and young ladies do— its
beautiful product of neat letters or school work
appealing especially to her. To learn on the Junior
is to qualify for a business position with any Standard
machine.

Why Not Maße Your Summer
>Smt Australian?
LI OLI DAY SUMS, Lounge Suits, Flannel Suits, Tennis
Suits, Boating Suits everywhere and on everybody. Every-
one must have them, and everyone wants them of the
best. Now nobody can know anything more certainly than this :
for lightness, coolness and wear nothing can beat Australian Wool
—pure wool, and nothing but wool; the wool that is to be obtained in
Vicais Tweeds and Flannels. Vicars of Marrickville guarantee this,
and will back their guarantee by sending samples to anyone who is
unable otherwise to get their tweeds and flannels.
Remember, when you are buying a suit of Vicars’ Tweed or
Flannel, you are not only getting the finest article of its kind in the
world, but you are demonstrating to Australia your belief in some-
thing which is all Australian, and doing your little bit to help
Australia by supporting (all the time for your own good) Australia’s
national industry.
Besides, the economic and natural logical conclusion must be
that it is better to get tweed or flannel made from all pure wool
which has been specially selected and bought by the manufacturer in
the country of origin, than it is to buy suits of flannel or tweed
composed of a mixture of everything^ —shoddy —made in a far distant
country and then shipped back to Australia. Have sense.
Again, if your tailor doesn’t keep these goods, or says he doesn’t
keep them, send along a postcard for samples to John Vicars & C 0.,.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tim Bulletin would oblige the paver
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard, to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor. Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “ropy.” Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.
Special Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be refused.
The contents of this paver are copyright by the pub-
lishers. The right to reproduce or translate any part, of
the contents of this number is hereby expressly reserved by
the publishers.
The Editor will-carefully read and, where practicable,
acknowledge in the “ Correspondence " column all contri-
butions submitted, ivhether in the form of Political,
Social, or other Articles, Verse, Short Tales or Sketches
(those dealing with Australian subjects, and not exceeding
two columns in length, or, say, WOO words, are specially
acceptable), Paragraphs, Letters, or Newspaper Clippings.
All communications will be regarded as strictly confi-
dential.
Tim Bulletin will return all unsuitable MS. when the
address is specified and stamps are enclosed. But no
MS. will be returned, or preserved, unless these conditions
are observed. When MS. is forwarded without stamps
for return it will be understood that the cony is to be
destroyed if not acceptable. Personal applications for
return of MS. cannot receive attention. Tiik Bulletin
desires, further, those sending MS. to distinctly under-
stand that it is not responsible tor the preservation or
transmission of MS.

merit and interest and adapted for direct reproduction, or

taining a good idea, but unfitted for direct reproduction
—any picture ivhich has to be re-drawn —will be paid
for as a suggestion only. The conditions under ivhich
such artistic contributions will be received are those

Wanderlust.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE world is all his wayside inn
Where he his evening’s rest may win,
He has no dear connubial spot,
Among no people casts his lot.
No man—or every man’s —his brother,
Each land’s as dear as every other ;
The hand he takes is any hand,
The land he loves is any land ;
His restless feet that ever roam
Make all the world his passing home.
The dull, plain men may strive and toil
To gain the honey and the oil ;
May frame the law and build the mart,
And dedicate their lives to art;
May sow the crop with hopes to reap
Ere they go quietly to their sleep,
Amid the loved familiar things
To which association clings ;
But nought to him the mounded grave
Where native daisies weep and wave,
The Wanderer who, ’twixt death and birth,
Is citizen of all the earth ;
No stranger tears for him shall fall
Who claims the universal all.
And what to him the civic seat
Where little fellow townsmen meet ?
The influence, the place and power
That others strive for in their hour?
And what to him the daily trade
Plied by the men for serfdom made ?
No dull, drab duties of the hearth
Lure him, the Wanderer, from his path.
THE HEATHEN IN HIS BLINDNESS.
MRS. QUAMBA : “ Well! the Rev. Brown was done to a turn to-day, wasn't he?”
MR. DO : “O, I don't know. When I remember how my mother used to get
these things up!” etc.
He takes his bundle on his back
And fares him on the foreign track ;
He hails the eagle on the peak,
The shy king pheasant by the creek ;
The grey wolf on her hungry plains,
The pert hedge sparrow in the lanes,
The lion in his jungle deep,
The wild ass where the grey sands sweep,
The white bear lumbering through the snow
Have watched the Wanderer onward go.
Strange colored men have seen him sup
And shared with him their drinking cup ;
• ’Mong crude communities afar
He’s made their evening star his star,
For a short space has been their kin
Abiding at their wayside inn.
But all the world’s his Inn, and so
Soon must he roll his swag and go,
Forced by the impulse in his blood,
The pricking of the gipsy mood ;
Anon his feet are by the shore,
The land-call urges him no more,
Instead the ocean powers command
And magnetise him from the land.
So on and on he wanders ever
In search of that he reaches never.
Why doth he wander ? Seeking what ?
Abjurer of the common lot,
No sturdy pioneer and wise
Out with the axe to colonise ;
He goes not with the things of trade ;
No missionary, has he made
Flis life a dedicated prayer
To take a Gospel everywhere ;
He has no weapons to subdue,
Bears but his staff both stout and true ;
No student’s notebook carries he,
No clever tools of artistry ;
Nor learns, nor teaches, brings nor takes,
Nor binds, nor loosens, wrecks nor makes.
Why doth he wander ? Seeking what ?
Abjurer of the common lot;
Fie knows not why but that he must,
For in him burns the Wanderlust,
A fire that surges in his breast
And makes unrest his only rest,
That makes him of the vagrant kin
Or all the world his wayside inn ;
And so he roves because he must,
The Pilgrim of the Wanderlust.

ALPENSTOCK.
Thompson’s Fight.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THOMPSON had been lying behind the rock
for a long time. Hours, it seemed to
him ; but it is difficult to keep account of
time when you are busy, and Thompson was very
busy !
It w'as swelteringly hot, and the vapor rising
from the sun-baked veldt made it difficult to aim.
Thompson and the Boer under that other rock,
iooo yards away, had exchanged a good many
shots ineffectually. Sometimes Thompson would
sportively put his big helmet round the side of his
rock with his right hand, holding his rifle care-
fully with his left, so that he could quickly shunt
on his elbows far enough out from his shelter to
take his shot as soon as he had drawn the fire of
the enemy.
The enemy ? Well, really, if he had used a
word for the Boer under that rock opposite it
would have been more like “friend.” He had
never seen the man to his knowledge nearer than
now, and all he could see now was a big slouch
hat, an occasional red patch of face under it sur-
rounded bv a dusty beard, and sometimes a
glimpse of a long dust-colored body lying at full
length, but foreshortened behind the head and the
Mauser.
Thompson did not feel the least enmity towards
the Boer. It was much more as if they were
playing a friendly game than pot-shotting for each
other’s lives, and Thompson, each time he got a
chance at a shot, smiled a sort of mischievous
smile as he pulled his trigger.
Several times he had said aloud, “ Got you
now, you beggar ” —as if he were saying “check-
mate” in a game of chess —and possibly the
Boer’s feelings towards Thompson were very
much like Thompson’s feelings towards the Boer.
However, the game was to pot the other fellow,
if possible, and give Him as little chance as
possible to pot you ; and each was playing the
game for all he was worth, except when the too-
insistent flies tickled his nose or stuck in the
corners of his eyes. Then. Thompson would knock
them off with a hot and grimy hand, and say
“ Damn the flies.” Probably, behind his own
rock, the Boer did the same thing and said much
the same.
On either side of Thompson, at varying dis-
tances determined by the position of the boulders,
lay or crouched other Australians playing a
similar game, each with another hot Boer for a
target. Practically it was a succession of duels
all along the line, and Thompson felt distinctly
aggrieved sometimes when he found another Boer
than his own particular man taking a sideways
shot at him. It seemed to Thompson that the
fellow was not playing the game.
Sometimes, looking along towards his own
comrades, he would see that one had dropped his
rifle and was lying flat and still. Sometimes an
oath would reach his ears, once or twice some-
thing very like a scream, or, again, an exultant
shout of “ Got him !” or “Plugged the beggar !”
But it was all very like a game.
Of course, when one on either side got his
quietus, it meant that a man in his neighborhood
had to dodge an extra rifle until he could quiet
one of his antagonists, or until he was quieted
himself. That made the game still more ex-
citing, and Thompson owned to himself, when his
next-door man gave a grunt and lay flat, and
when the dead man’s Boer, having waited some
time with rifle ready for any return of movement
in his own opponent, finally turned his attention
unreservedly to Thompson, that that was all
right. So long as the Boer was not neglecting
his own proper “ Colonial ” he had every right
to shoot at Thompson.
He took a shot at the second Boer’s head as it
came cautiously round the rock. “Got him !” he
said with satisfaction as the head remained in
sight; but it was really only the hat which he had
neatly perforated. There had been no head in it,
but Thompson didn’t know that, and he turned
his whole attention to Boer No. I. And then,
just as he was in full expectation of a good,
undisturbed shot as soon as his man should re-
appear, he felt a sharp shock on his breast and
his rifle dropped to the ground.
He thought at first he was hit, but feeling no
further pain anywhere he concluded it was not
so, and he prepared to go on with the game.
But as he might fully expect his Boer to be wait-
ing by this time for his next reappearance, he got
up on his knees and sidled round to the other side
of his rock, with a view to a fresh sort of surprise.
But the surprise was on Thompson, for there was
his Boer calmly exposing most of his person to
Thompson’s fire while he drew a careful bead on
an Australian away on his right. There, also,
was No. 2 Boer fully exposed to Thompson’s fire
while he dodged another Australian on the left.
“ By Gad, they think they’ve settled me,” said
Thompson, and chuckled while he took a long,
cool aim at No. I as being the man with the first
claim on his attention. But, though he was sure
his bullet must have drilled right through the
middle of that dusty heap of clothes, no result
appeared. Boer No. i went on dodging his new
Australian as if Thompson not only had not fired,
but as if he did not exist.
Thompson tried a long, careful shot at Boer
No. 2 for a change, but again with no result.
No. 2 went on with his business without any let
or hindrance. “ That's jolly rum,’ said Thomp-
son, and jerked out his next Cartridge to see if by
chance he had had blanks served out to him. No, it
was all right; but half a dozen more shots evenly
distributed between the two Boers brought no
replv from either of them, and at last Thompson
sat up thoroughly bewildered.
“Damn the fellows ! Why don't they take
any notice of me ? ” he asked in an aggrieved
voice of the surrounding air. “ And why can’t I
hit them ? ” At last he decided to move.
As Boer No. 2 had killed his right-hand neigh-
bor, he began to crawl in that direction. As he
did so, he noticed a man start also from the rock
for which he was making and begin to crawl
towards him.
“ There must have been two of them there,’
said Thompson to himself, “ but I only saw one.’
Both men wormed along the sunbaked earth at
first ; but as no shots came near them they
both got to all-fours until they met at the middle
point.
“ Rum thing,” said Thompson, “ they won’t
fire at me now.”
“ Same here,” said the other man, “and, what s
more, I’m damned if I can hit the beggars.
“Neither can I,” said Thompson. “Seems
as if we must be bewitched.”
“Who’s that dead man behind your rock ? ’
asked the other man. “ Didn't know there were
two of you there.”
“ Neither there were,” said Thompson ;“ he
must have got there since I left” —for, on looking
hack, there was a man’s body sure enough.
“ Let’s go and see who it is. There’s one behind
yours too.”
“ Well, this is the rummest go,” said the other.
“ He wasn’t there when I left, either.”
They crawled hack and reached Thompson's
boulder, and there they found an Australian in a
cloud of flies. He had fallen forwards, but his
face was turned sideways to the earth so that it
was visible. Thompson looked in the dead man s
face, and the dead man’s face was the face of
Thompson.
Then they realised that all over the battlefield
there were men who seemed to be living, looking
with bewilderment at dead men who lay behind
rocks-5-and they knew.

Suburbia—a Yearn.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OMAN with a Position, prithee tell,
How is’t you mould your sal’ried life so
well ;
Holding in lofty scorn that lowly mob
Of “blokes” who earn mere “wages” at a
“job.”
Knight of Suburbia, whose only care
Is to be counted ’mid the “ naicest. ” thene,
Teach me how I, some day, may learn to be
Clothed in drab Respectability.
I cannot muster due respect for those
Who wear the very nicest kind of clothes ;
Nor does the Upper House sufficiently
Impress the dull, “ right-thinking ” part o’ me.
Fain would I garb my meekness in a coat
Whose very blackness struck a pious note,
And crease my pants, and aye, with tender care,
Arrange becomingly my plebeian hair.
A “ Something in the City ” would I be,
With due respect for men of Propputy.
Or sooth, if such ambition be too rash,
I’d, as a godlike grocer, groce for cash.
Ah, lead me to some suburb grey and calm !
My very soul craves for a potted palm
In my front porch. Nay, but it were sublime
To stalk the stealthy slug o’ summer-time.
Then would I take some proper girl to wife,
And know the joys of a “ well-ordered ” life,
Beget suburban daughters who would be
Models of drawing-room propriety.
Ah me, that drawing-room ! —my lady’s pride.
With products of Chow-labor side by side,
An upright grand by Bubblestein and Bohrs,
And framed enlargements o( our ancestors.
Our arms—a “ what not ” rampant on a ground
Of pious drab. There would we sit around
While Bertha thumped the keys o’ balmy eves,
And caterpillars chewed the fuchsia leaves.
There would we offer incense, highly toned,
And worship, nightly, Furniture enthroned.
There would we—nay, I may not even hope,
Whose only wash-hand bowl is plugged with soap.
With yellow soap, to caulk a leak obscene—
Whose writing-table once held kerosene.
What does he wot of over-mantels, he
Who keeps tobacco where he should keep tea ?
Knight of Suburbia, your daily round,
Treading to morning trains the same old ground.
Is not for me ; though I would gladly be
A champion at passing cakes and tea.
O, that the stars had willed it were my fate
To be immoderately moderate ;
To sit at eve, ’mid fans and photo, frames,
And plav at sundry senseless parlor games ;
Then, haying bathed my soul in revelry,
Put out the cat, and turned the front door key,
Away to rest, by one dim taper’s gleam,
To court the vague, unnecessary dream.
VICTORIA.

On Cupid’s Common.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ABOUT the Park in aimless way
The faint, hot summer breezes stray ;
With veil of cloud across her face,
Pale beauty peeping through her lace,
The moon rules all in her survey.
On twigs and brittle grass at rest,
I 1011, unquestionably blest.
What count the cramp, the aching spine,
A little head I deem divine
Is tucked in close against my vest.
Those lovers decorous who play
In primrose paths, ah, what know they
Of quaint vicissitudes that nark
A vagrant courtship in the park—
On Cupid’s common flat and grey ?
Here with the dusk, in faith sublime,
A suburb’s pilgrims come betime,
Till huddled couples fleck the waste,
At thirty paces trimly placed—
To break the limit is a crime.
Breathed softly on her veiled eyes
My ardent protestations rise,
And faint and low from far and near
Comes whispering at my darling’s ear
The chorus of a thousand lies.
I press a cheek whose dimpled blisses
I lave not their peer in any miss’s,
From all the shadows of the night,
Like locusts mustering for flight,
Spring echoes of a plague of kisses.
And o’er us, surging in the air,
In billows, humming past compare,
An army of mosquitoes’ drums.
Blood-lusting from the lake it comes
1 o gorge on the unconscious fair.
“Ah, say you love me only, dear ! ”
The vow is sworn, and lips adhere—
But what cold horror takes me now ?
It is a calm, intrusive cow,
Whose dabbled nose is in my ear.
My sweet at peace a moment lies,
then “Mother!” screams, and “Murder!”
cries.
She seeks awhile with fevered zeal,
And ground beneath a vengeful heel
The beetle for his trespass dies.
A sniffing pony next annoys,
A mongrel with my ankle toys.
Worst torments that on lovers fall,
For sultry minutes we know all
The pagan ribaldry of boys.
Now coin in tribute to evoke
Comes some insinuating bloke,
Or slyly creeping from the trees
A pious bobby on his knees,
His helmet hidden ’neath his cloak.
No need to question what he’s at.
■Small ease can love have after that.
Despite these trials is not met
The culminating sorrow yet—
A calf has eaten Stella’s hat !
Blest is the land, it seems to me,
From prudish ills and fancies free, '
Where for each willing lad is found
A pleasant plot of hallowed ground
To court his dear one decently.
VICTORIA.
EDWARD DYSON.
The Psycho-Bacteriological
Pushite.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE most silent of all the customers at the
all-night restaurant was the young man
with the long fringe and the bell-bottomed
trousers, who, as he finished his fish and chips,
would lean against the door-jamb of the back
room, chewing reflectively as the others recounted
brave happenings of the day. The only time he
manifested any particular interest was when
strangers entered the shop and engaged the pro-
prietor in quiet conversation. A whispered dia-
logue penetrating the open door would sometimes
plunge him into something approaching excite-
ment ; though, as soon as the identity of the caller
became apparent, he would speedily resume his
customary stoicism.
All that was known of him was that he had not
been in Melbourne long, and it was not until the
raiding of the two-up school next door that the
rest became recipients of his confidence.
The night of the raid, the usual customers were
all in their places, enjoying their supper, when the
crash of a falling door led everybodv to jump sud-
denly to their feet.
“ What ef it’s the Johns?’’ asked a hoarse
voice.
The voice was unknown. None of those present
except the proprietor had previously heard it.
They turned and found the' speaker to be the
young man with the fringe, who had left his
favorite spot against the wall, and was standing
with clenched fists in an attitude of defiance.
“Things is on’y middlin’,” he murmured as the
sound of an axe shattering woodwork burst upon
the assemblage.
The suspense for a few minutes was intense.
Then the proprietor, who had been in the street,
dashed in with the welcome news that the police
did not suspect any of those present of complicity,
and were content with having broken up the
school.
“ It’s lucky, gentlemen,” he added, “that I
knew none of the school were in here to-night. I
would have had to stick to them, and it would
probably have meant a fight.”
“ Good iron ! ” cried the youth with the fringe.
“ I ain’t dealt wif nobody since I took on this
here billet, an’ me han’s is gettin’ rust on ’em. ”
“Have you then fought for Empire?” asked
Mr. Gibbs, whose addresses on Imperialism were
of almost nightly occurrence. Mr. Gibbs, now
night watchman, was reputed to be a F. R.G. S.
in private life.
“ Gam, git work !” replied the youth. “ I’ve
done more fightin’ than yous sort ever heard of.
I’d sooner fight than eat, I would. A good scrap
ter me's more’n a Paris House dinner with the
shinest clinah on the Rocks frown in.”
“ What regiment, might I ask, were you asso-
ciated with ? ” inquired Mr. Gibbs, severely. The
free, Democratic manner of the youth was repug-
nant to him, and-he deemed it necessary to show
him his pldce.
“ Reg’mint, yer ole man,” retorted the other.
“ I’m Slab McGuinness, o’ th’ Rocks Push.
Don’t come any kid as yer ain’t never heard o’
me or I’ll stoush yer straight ! Garn, fr two pins
I’d swing on yer now, yer cow.”
“ Gentlemen, gentlemen,” interposed the pro-
prietor, always a man of peace. “There must
be no quarrelling. Perhaps it will help matters
if Mr. McGuinness will give us the facts upon
which he bases his argument.”
“ Righto, boss,” replied Mr. McGuinness
mollified, as he gnawed a chunk off a plug of
tobacco. “ Yer see, it’s this way, I used ter be
a psycho-bacteriologist.”
“A psycho-bacteriologist?” echoed the pro-
prietor.
“That’s right,” assented Mr. McGuinness.
“ I can’t say I ever heard of the profession
before,” observed Mr. Gibbs, sarcastically.
“That’s more ’n likely. They’s prob’ly a lot
o’ things you don’t know,” said Mr. McGuinness.
“ See here, who's tellin’ this tale—me or you? A
bloke wif a front like you’d last about n seconds
down on ther Rocks. One yer'd be firin’ off yer
face, an’ th’ other io they'd be countin’ yer out.
You got ter learn ter be a genelman, or somefin
’ll happen, an’ ye’ll never know what hit yer.”
Mr. McGuinness glared fiercely for three silent
seconds. Mr. Gibbs wriggled uneasily in his seat
and said nothing, whereupon Mr. McGuinness
continued.
“ Yer see, it was like this : Onst I was a toffy
bloke. Me ole man was a squatter up Monaro
way, an’ when I was a nipper nothin’ but the best
was good enough fur me. Governesses at first,
then sent down ter Sydney ter college ; an’ when
I d passed matric. I went on ter th’ University ter
study fur a doctor. Gorblime, how I grafted !
It was a game I got fair shook on ; an’ night an’
day there I was, grafting hell-for-leather. My
oath ! I wasn’t a bit o’ good. What about
ornery work th’ other students used ter quit
under ? I took it in me stride. Exams, never
worried me. I jest went up, an’ was out grafting
at research work before the other blokes had their
first question done. I tell yer, without a word of
a lie, I was the real thing at that there Sydney
University. I was the white-haired boy o’ th’
purfessors, an’ when I snavelled me degree I
wouldn’t hear nothin’ about going inter any
practice. Not me. ‘ Gam,' I says ter all the ole
man’s friends when they tries ter kid me ter buy a
brass plate. ‘ Garn,’ I says jest like that, ‘yous
blokes keep yer bloomin’ brass plates fur little
boys. I’m on a better lurk.’ Straight, I didn’t
want no money. I was on the science lay—re-
search work—readin’ up what they done in other
places, an’ tryin’ ter go one better.
“ I had a great go with a bloke name o’
Schweindorfer, a purfessor at Berlin University
onst, but he was out o’ my class. I made him
look a lightweight in th’ third roun', an’ he skied
the towel when I started putting in me fancy
work. That lot got me the Rumford medal, but
I never looked at the blasted thing. My troubles
about medals or any sich tomfoolery. I done it
in on a clinah I picked up at Chowder one day
since, an’ Gawd knows where it is neow.
“ The scientific papers was full o’ me then, not
only in Sydney but all over the world. They
said as how I was Australia’s most scientific son,
an’ the patriotic blokes used ter make songs fur
the pantomimes about me an’ Bill Squires in the
same verse. I was lonely bunyip in them days, I
promise yer. But I wasn’t havin’ *any gyver.
All I cared about was the graft in th’ laboratory.
There I was, all the time, tryin’ ter work out a
theory o’ me own. It wasn’t any problem of life
racket. That was too easy. What I was after
was to discover if th’ brain was subject ter the
effects of micro-organisms like what the body
is. After a bit, I found I couldn’t get on in
Sydney. All day long, Governors an’
Prime Ministers an’ some o’ the push
what holds it come roun’ invitin’ me
ter dinner-parties an’ balls an’ things,
an’ tellin’ me what a great bloke I
was. I didn’t like ter clear ’em
out. I was a dead mug in them
days about a lot o’ things. Ef
they come it on me now I’d hand
out a few ter ’em, jest ter encour-
age ’em ter get a move on. As long’s
a man’s game he’s right. All the
troubles on this here earth, yer can
betcher boots, is due ter quittin’. That’s
what was the matter wif me. I quit. Instead o’
stayin’ on in Sydney an’ stoushin’ one or two of
them silvertails what usedter bother me, I shifted
me whole laboratory ter Coongulmerang—a bit o’
a bush township up Bourke way.
“ Me an’ me assistant stopped at the local pub.
there, an’ inside of a week I had everythin’ goin'.
I promise yer, them days up there was the hap-
piest I ever spent in me life. They was nothin’
ter interrup’ us, an’ all day long we’d graft over
the test choobs, gettin’ nearer an’ nearer every
minute. Some o’ yous genelmen must ha’ bin in-
a scrap sometime or other. Yer know how yer
feel when ye’ve bin thinkin’ a bloke's got yer
done ; then yer see him start ter weaken an’
gradually yer chop bits off of him till he goes
under. It’s jest like that too, when yer git a
microbe cornered. Whether it’s in the ring or in
the laboratory, us scientists is pretty much the
same.
“ I'd bin there three munce when I got ready
fur the greatest experiment o’ me life. The cul-
tures was slowly developin’, an’ the bloke I had
assistin’ me was jest as excited as me. O’ny he
was nervous as well. Blast him, it was his ner-
vousness what bust up the whole bloomin’ show.
I remember that night. I wanted him ter go
away ter bed while I waited up fur the cultures
ter develop. But not a bit of it. He was on the
job too, an’ it’d ha’ took dynamite ter shift him.
I had me watch out an’ when the time come, I
got the broth under the microscope an’ looked in.
My oath ! It was there ! Little crawling blokes
like crayfish. D’yer know what I’d got, genel-
men ? It was the germ o’ genius !
“ I don’t never remember what happened after ;
neither did the bloke with me. When we come
to we was back in our beds. As soon as I woke
I jumped out an’ run over ter the laboratory in
me pyjamas. Yes, there they was, lively as
widders, turnin’ off laps roun’ the glass in even
time. When we’d had our breakfast I made the
assistant git ready for the first train ter Sydney,
sealed up a couple o’ jars o’ the broth an’ sent
along a wire ter me ole purfessor at the Univer-
sity, tellin’ him me discovery. I took the bottles
ter the station, put me assistant on the train, and,
blime, if the silly cow didn’t drop one o’ them jars
on the platform jest as the train went off. I was
a bit narked, fur I wanted a couple o’ people ter
git the cultures. Still, I’d got plenty more, so I
didn’t worry much.
“ I went back to the laboratory an’ commenced
writin’ a thesis on the discovery. Hours passed,
an’ when I looked at me watch I found it was
past dinner time. I went back ter th’ pub, but
they wasn’t no signs o’ th’ feed. I went inter the
kitchen. They wasn’t nobody there. Th’ bar
was empty excep’ fur a man with a swag, who
was siftin’ on the bench. I watched him fur five
minutes, but he never made a break fur the bar
or tried to sneak a drink.
“ ‘ What ho, mate,’ I says.
“ ‘Ssh’ !” he says, wavin’ hishan’ wifout lookin’
at me.
“ ‘ What’s wrong, pink rabbits?’ I arsts him.
“ ‘ Ssh,' he says, ‘leave the philosopher wif his
thoughts.’
“ ‘Righto,’ I says, ‘don’t get narked.’ An’
off I gits ter look fur somebody else. They was
a blacksmith’s shop nex’ door, but when I looks
in they wasn’t a soul there. A horse was pawin’
away, awaiting ter get shod, and they was a bar
o’ iron on the fire, but nobody about. I looks
out inter the paddick, an' what did I see but the
blacksmith graftin’ wif a chunk o’ charcoal on th’
back wall o’ the hotel. I mooches over ter him.
“ ‘ What ho, mate,’ I says, ‘ what's yer lurk ? ”
“ ‘ Git away,’ he says, * what d’ you know o’
Art ? ’ An’ wif that he makes a big sweep o' his
arm an’ draws a bloke life-size on the wall.
“ ‘ What’s this here goin’ ter be ? ’ I arsts him.
“ ‘ This,’ says the blacksmith, ‘ is a cartoon fur
a great historical pitcher—the Battle o’ Captin
Cook wdf a Bunyip. I ’spect it’ll take me a
couple o’ years ter finish it.’
“ ‘ Garn,’ I says, ‘ are yer goin’ ter live on air
till then ? ’
“ ‘The call o’ Art must be obeyed at whatever
hazards,’ he says.
“ That satisfied me. I reckoned he was off his
pannikin alright, so I makes fur the storekeeper.
They w'asn’t no sign o’ him about. There w'as
the shop all ready fur anybody what wanted next
Sat’d’y night’s stock an’ nobody ter tell ’em ter
drop it. I cot sight o’ the storekeeper way down
at th’ end o’ another paddick wif a dozen o’ the
other people in the township. He was standin’

on a stump, an’ they was all gathered roun’
listenin’ ter him.
“ ‘ What’s this,’ I yelled out, as I got near
’em —‘ a meetin’ o’ th’ Farmers’ League or a
speech fur the nex’ election ? ’
“‘Order,’ says the bank manager, turning
round sudden, wif tears runnin’ down his cheeks.
Then I saw that they was all cryin'—all bu* the

THERE are three trees on O’Halloran

All stark and stiff beside the sea.
And 'twas beneath the middle one
Love caught my love, and he caught
me!
And once I looked upon the sky,
And once I looked upon the shore,
And once into the eyes of him
That left me there and came no more!
The leaves that kissed above our heads
And smiled to see two lovers meet,
S. A.
Have dried and fallen, one by one,
And now lie crushed beneath my feet!
The blossoms that made sweet the air
To stir my heart like golden wine,
Are withered like the joys I knew,
And wet with tears, and salt with brine!
There are three trees on O’Halloran

All still and stark beside the sea!
I would that I lay in the sand
Deep down beneath the middle tree!

storekeeper, who was claspin’ his hands ter his
forehead, yellin’ out about his lost Cleopatra.
“ It beat me fair, so I jest waited.
“ ‘ Since Cleopatra died,’ says the storekeeper,
‘ I have lived in sech dishonor that the world doth
wonder at my baseness.’
“My oath! it was marvellous. The way he
spoke them words, it seemed ter go right through
me stummick, straight. I never felt anything like
it before. I tell yer, it was murder. Before two
minutes, I was there blubbering wif the rest o’
them. I never seen sich an actor before. I seen
Sara Bernhardt at Sydney when I was a kid, an’
this here storekeeper was a fair mate fur yer. I
was near starvin’ be this time, but I forgot all
about me dinner. I jest sat down on a fallen
limb an’ let it soak in. One moment he made
yer feel like a bloke fightin’ all he’s worth in a
close push scrap. The next, it was like’s if the
tailboard’d dropped off of the world an’ all the
good things was spilt. At the end of the first act
I done a shunt, an’ poled back ter the hotel ter
look fur tucker. They was on’y the swaggie
there.
“ ‘ Spinoza’s all wrong,’ he says, as I come in.
“ ‘ Gam,’ I says, ‘ what’s he bin doin’ now ? ”
“ ‘ Karit is wrong; Nietzsche is wrong,’ he went
on. ‘ I have solved the only true philosophy.’
“ I wasn’t talcin’ any o’ his guyver, so I makes
a break fur the safe, an’ has a rare ole time
wrastlin’ wif a col’ pertaleran’ a leg o’ last Sun-
day's mutton. I was jest beginnin’ ter feel pretty
comfortable, thank yer, when th’ poun’keeper
comes rushin’ in the back dore wif a glare in his
eye that made me grab a swingle-bar what was
lyin’ against the wall.
“ ‘ What’s the trouble, mate ? ’ I arsts him.
“ He jest scowls an’ waves his han’ ter me ter
be quiet, an’ rushes inter the bar parlor. I
reckoned as he was ratty like th’ rest o’ ’em, so
I gets after him. He makes straight fur the
pianner, an’ before I knoo what he was at, he
starts off on a choon what knocked ‘ Th’ Honey-
suckle an’ th’ Bee ’ out in one roun’. He had
‘ Florodora ’ shakin’ at the knees before he’d been
goin’ five minutes, an' he was puttin’ up a game
fight wif every coon song ever sung. It wasn’t
exactly a choon. He jest let his han’s loose on
the pianner, an’ the music come of itself.
“ ‘ What’s that there yer playin’ ? ’ I arsts him.
“ ‘ I’m improvisin’,’ he says.
“ I tumbled back inter a’ armchair an’ shut me
eyes. I could hear the birds twitterin’ an’ the
waterfalls bubblin’ over the rocks. Then the sky
was clouded, an’ the lightnin’ started rockin’ in
the curly ones. Talk about storms ! It was one
o’ Wragge’s best. I was hidin’ under the table
before I knoo what I was doin’, an’ at last he give
me sich a scare that I dropped me bundle an’ run
fur it. I didn’t pull up till I was away out at the
edge of the ranges, half a mile away. I seen a
bloke a bit ahead o’ me, an’ I makes fur him ter
arst him if he knoo what had happened ter send
everybody off their pannikin. It was Sergeant
Doolan, th’ copper.
“ ‘ Mornin’, sergeant,’ I says.
“ He looks straight at me, but never says a
word.
“ ‘ Mornin’, sergeant,’ I says again ; but he
jest goes on lookin’ at me. Then I sees his lips
move.
“‘Till mighty Tarsus doth his mountains
move, and Pelion pile his masses on the sea,’ he
says, and, pullin’ out his regulation notebook, he
starts writin’.
“‘I beg yer pardon,’ I says, ‘but I didn’t
catch yer meanin’ ?’
The sergeant he jest puts back his book an’
walks up an’ down between two big gum trees,
wif his forehead ribbed like a prize merino.
“‘I beg yer pardon, sergeant,’ I says again.
He looks pp sudden.
“‘Ah,’ he says, ‘ Purfessor. 1 didn’t notice
yer. I’m engaged in a great work.’
“ ‘ After them cattle thieves?’ I says.
“He shook his head. ‘ No,’ he says ; ‘ I am
writin’ a blank verse tragedy.’ >
Before I could arst him anythin’ more an idea
struck him, an’ he had his note-book out again.
“‘ So long, sergeant,’ I says. He never
answered me, an’ I walked back ter th’ town-
ship.
“ I found all the rabbit crates an’ butter boxes
out in the station yard. Nuthin’ was got ready
fur the afternoon’s train, an’ the station-master

science must eliminate.’
“ ‘ Gam,’ I says, ‘ since yer put it that way, I
suppose it must be so.’
“ ‘ The existence of the wage fund has mili-
tated against the adoption of this theory in the
past,’ he went on.
“ Before I could speak the telegraph bell
started ringin’.
“ ‘ That’s the Sydney train,’ I says.
“ ‘ What is the Sydney train ter the solution of
mighty problems of economics ? ’ he says.
“ ‘Blessed ef I know,’ I says. Jest then the
engine whistles behind the hill an’, five minutes
after, in it comes slow as a hobbled slug, fur all
the signals was against it fur the last five miles.
AN AFTER-DINNER REFLECTION.
CANNIBAL CHIEF (who has just dined on his youngest and plumpest wife): “Alas!
How miserably true is the old saying , ‘ You can't eat your girl and have herd .”
The first people ter jump out was the faculty o'
science from Sydney University. They pressed
aroun’ me, congratulatin’ me fur me discovery an’
tellin’ me as how the glad tidin’s would be cabled
ter Europe, an’ set the scientific world ablaze ;
but they’d reckoned it good biz ter keep it quiet
fur the present. We had a bit o’ a talk an' I had
ter apologise fur not havin’ any tea ready fur them,
explainin’ how all the whole township had
suddenly gone ratty. Purfessor Hinkley, he
looked a bit grave, an’ after I'd tole him me ex-
periences, he says :
“ ‘ Did any o’ the germs git loose ? ’
“ I seen it all ! It was that there jar what me
assistant had dropped as the train went out. The
germs had got loose an’ attacked everybody in the
place. Coongulmerang was carrying more geni-
uses ter the acre than ancient Athens ever heard of.
“ ‘ What’s ter be done?’ says Purfessor Hink-
ley. ‘ Have yer got a prophylactic ? ’
‘‘‘ My oath !’ I says. ‘ What sort of a false-
alarm bacteriologist d’yer think I am, ef I don’t
work out the prophylactic at the same time as the
germs ? ’
“ ‘Good !’ he says. ‘We must inoculate all
these poor people fur their own good, an’ the good
o’ humanity. If we don’t, they’ll go spreadin’
infection through tb" entire community, an’ before
we know wher’ we are genius ’ll become endemic.’
“ I took ’em up ter the laboratory as proud as
a dawg wif a tin tail, an’, the moment I got inside
the door, Purfessor Plinkley shuts it careful while
I shows ’em the cultures an’ th’ prophylactic.
Then, all of a sudden, two of ’em grabs me from
behind, an’ before I knoo what was happenin’
they’d tied me up in a chair like a trussed turkey.
“ ‘ What’s this here game ?’ I says.
“‘Purfessor McGuinness, ’ says Purfessor
Hinkley, ‘ we have bin talkin’ this here matter
over in th’ train cornin’ up, an’ w'e’ve decided ter
take heroic remedies. While appreciatin’ deeply
the wonderful nacher of yer discoveries in th’
cause o’ science, we cannot under any considera-
tion allow it ter become known.’
“‘What!’ I yelled, ‘after five years’ work,
are yer’——
“Purfessor Hinkley raised his hand. ‘lt’s
hard. I know,’ he says, ‘ but it’s inevitable ; an’ I
think, on hearin’ our arguments, yer will acquit
us o’ any suspicion o’ jealousy. Have yer ever
thought o’ what the consequences ’ll be o’ this
here discovery ? Me an’ you an’ all 0’ us are
geniuses now, an’ we make a tidy bit out o’ the
trade. But what’ll happen if this here discovery
o’ yours gits on the market and everybody who
wants ter be a genius can buy sixpenn’orth o’
germs and an eighteenpenny hypodermic syringe
at the nearest chemist ? Think o’ it. Half a
million people in Sydney, all geniuses starvin’ in
garrets, because the producing interest’s slumped
ter nothin’ ! Yer got a fine object lesson in this
here township now. From wher’ I’m sittin’ I
can see a feller what ought ter be milkin’ his cows
makin’ a nood nymph outer mud. Have yer ever
thought o’ that ? ’
“Strike me pink, if I could answer him. It
never struck me that way before. But, all the
same, I wasn’t gointer quit on the job.
“ ‘What's the good o’ yer talkin’, I says, “ I’ll
safeguard the secret alright, but yer ain’t gointer
beat me fur it all the same.’
“ ‘ We have anticipated your opposition,’ says
Purfessor Hinkley, ‘ and in order to ensure your
harmlessness in future, we have reluctantly deter-
mined on a course which is rendered necessary
through the seriousness of the position. We
intend to inoculate you yourself with the pro-
phylactic and, in order that your' unbounded
energies may have an adequate outlet, we shall in-
ject into your blood a serum of larrikinism which
has jest bin extracted from an eminent member of
the Liver Push at the University laboratory.’
“ Genelmen, that beat me. I went out. The
laboratory swam roun’ me fur a second. Then it
was dead dark. When I woke up I found every
choob in the place was smashed. Tb’ township
was back graftin’ at its old billets again, an’ the
purfessors’d all got back ter Sydney. I made fur
the bar, soaked in all the beer me skin’d hold,
got inter a scrap wif the swaggie, an’ swung one
onter the sergeant that sent him out fur five hours
when he come ter pinch me. I got on the train
witout a ticket, an’ fought the porter at Sydney
when he arst me fur it. I done a monf fur that
lot, an’ when I come outer stir I went down ter
th’ University laboratory. Before the crowd o’
cops rolled in an’ smothered me science, I had
three purfessors an’four;demonstrators cured o’
insomnia be me marvellous massage cure ; they
wasn’t a bit o’ glass in the buildin’, an’ the floor
was swimmin’ wif enough microbes ter devastate
the solar system. I got narked in Court, give the
beaks a bit o’ the best talk the Rocks push could
projuice, an’ I went in fur a sixer.
“ When I come out I become a duly qualified
member o’ the push wif a diploma signed be th’
Dean o’ th’ Faculty up at Darlinghurst. One
night we dealt wif a John dowm th’ Argyle Cut
so willin’ that they thought he'd cop out.
They was warrants out fur some o’ us fur grievous
bodily, so we reckoned it was up ter us ter take
shirrocker. I got over ter Melbourne here an’
kep’ outer trouble. Beyond smashin’ up a bar or
two an’ woodenin’ a couple o’ Chows, I’ve led
the simple life since I bin here. Th’ on’y trouble
is that one o’ these days th’ Johns ’ll tumble.
Jest now they come so close that yer could feel
their breaths. I made up me mind it was a blue
duck. But now I kin see as how 1 I kin rely on
yous gent? ter put me fly when they’s th’ smell o'
a shiny hat loomin' in tht middle distance.”
“You need have no apprehension on that
score,” announced the proprietor. “All my cus-
tomers are the soul of honor, and, as for myself, I
let my past record tell its tale.”
“That’s alright,’’ murmured the psycho-
bacteriologist, sceptically, “I don't doubt yer
word ; but what about that there egg yer done me
in over on Chewsdee night ? Ef that wasn’t one
o’ th’ left-overs from Adam’s weddin’ breakfast,
yer kin ’phone up ter th’ Front Orfice an’ give
Sherlock Holmes a job.”

Fighting in the Snow.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rHE hills lay white with virgin snow—
Far up the Central Line,
The fences, where the land is low,
It covered, drifting fine.
Into the cuttings wide it blew
A fathom deep, and so
We took the heavy No. 2
To fight the choking snow.
We ran her out behind the plough
Into a world all white.
Said Joe the driver, “ Here’s a go !
We won’t get back to-night.”
They cheered us out of Ranfurly,
And up the grade we roared,
Ploughing the snowfield like a sea
That tossed white spray aboard ;
While gleaming waves of silver streamed—
Ghost-waves with ne’er a hiss—
Said Bill the fireman, “ Once I dreamed
About a trip like this.”
As the big drivers crunched and ground
The snow balled up in front,
Then toppled over, tumbled round,
And, to her husky grunt,
It fell among her spinning spokes
And burst among the rods
In clouds, like incense that invokes
The favor of the gods.
Three feet of level, gleaming snow
We drove the big plough through-
There never was a man like Joe
Who ran the No. 2.
At Wedderburn we filled the tank.
“ We’ll need it all,” quoth Joe
To charge the cuttings up the bank.
I bet they’re filled with snow.”
Then Gray ran out his Twenty-eight,
Shoving a loaded truck :
“ I’ll push behind to give you weight,”
Said he ; “ you might get stuck.”
Beyond the yard and up the hill
We went with fires aglow,
Through winds that whistled keen and shrill
To fight the stubborn snow.
It lay within the cutting deep,
Six feet above the track.
We hit it hard with rods a-sweep
And then it hit us back,
Right to the funnel’s rim it sprang
And all the while behind
We heard the Twenty-eight that sang
Like a wild mountain wind.
Onward for half a chain we strove,
Then Bill remarked to Joe,
“ It cuddles like a turtle-dove
And gives us blow for blow.”
The snow, so pure and white and soft,
Clung to her like a curse.
Hoarsely our engine's whistle coughed
To bid her mate reverse.
By might they dragged the snow-plough out
And backed away to blow ;
Then, shouting loud as giants shout,
They charged the silent snow.
We hit the drift a dozen times.
And sullenly it gave,
Rising and breaking high, as climbs
The thwarted tidal wave.
And when all clear the cutting lay
The night came down, all stars ;
The cold wind sobbed and died away ;
Ice ringed the rods and bars,
And made the wheels spin round in vain,
And set the stacks a-roar
With sparks that lit the mantled plain,
And we could fight no more.
The men who drove the Twenty-eight
Set off across the snow
On foot: “ It’s too dashed cold to wait,”
Said they. “ Let’s stay,” said Joe.
About the cab a tarpaulin
He lashed, and so contrived
To make it fit to shelter in
Until the dawn arrived.
For miles about us naught but snow
Looked up to cold, blue stars.
But we all kept the fire aglow,
And someone had cigars ;
So, on the summit of the earth
(God knows how grades will rise !),
We clustered round that engine-hearth,
And Joseph told us lies.
Next day the Twenty-eight was ice
From dome to driving-wheel;
You'd hit her with a hammer twice
Before you found the steel.
So we went on behind the plough,
And found the going tough.
When we thrashed into Omakau
We’d had about enough.
But Joe looked out on those who cheered
And thus spake Driver Joe :
“ Where is this track you’re wanting cleared?
“ Dash you ! Bring out your snow ?”
When hills are mantled in the snow,
’ Way up the Central Line ;
When /ence posts all are buried low
The raihuay men opine
There's only one thing left to do —
They call on Driver foe
And Billy and the Number 2
To go andfight the snow.
MAORILAND.

The Ungentlemanly Behavior of
Alec Higgens.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IDUNNO what girls are coming to now’days.
They don’t somehow appreciate a man who’s
refined and gentlemanly, like what I am.
Loud, flash coves like that Alec ’lggens seem to
get on ; and yet Alec’s an utter bounder, lacking
all gentlemanly instincts. Wait till I tell you
what ’e done to me.
One night last week I was waitin’ outside the
stage-door for, a little girl, a pantomime fail V she
was, just the driest, sweetest little thing, with
fluffy hair and—and all that, you know. Very
fond of me too—in a way, though I says it per’aps
as shouldn’t. I was lookin’just my best. Had on
my new check suit, with a flower in my button-
hole, and a walkin’-stick all complete. Gloves
too, of course ; I know how to dress when I like.
And on this occasion
I did like. You see, she
was no ord’nary chorus
girl, I give you my
word. No, she was a
show-lady, and very
refined. Leastways
that’s what I thought
then. Just shows you,
you can’t never tell
with women. How-
ever, she’s done ’erself
in with me now.
She had a bit of a
part in the pantomime.
In the second act she
had to say ; ‘ ‘ Lo, be-
hold he comes ! ” Did
it real well too.
When the show first
started she had quite a
lot to say. You remem-
ber that bit about—
Little fairies, small an’
neat,
Trippin’ round on twinklin’
feet ?
Well, them were her
lines, till the stage-
manager took ’em away
from ’er and gave ’em
to another girl who was
jealous. In fact, all
the girls were jealous
of her because she
danced so fine. But
they weren’t half so
jealous of her as what
the boys were of me for
being so thick with her.
They all wanted me
to introduce ’em, but I
wasn’t taking any.
Alec, especially, was
very anxious to meet
her. Now, Alec’s all
right in his way among
men, but with girls he’s
a bit loud an’ free.
“ Breezy manner,” he
calls it. It certainly
does seem to work
with some girls. He
gets busy very early.
Pinches their arms an’
calls ’em “old dear,”
an’ the girls (some
girls) giggle and say,
“You are a one. ”
Of course, as I say,
that’s all right with some
girls—fact’ry tarts an’
such. But with bar-
maids and girls with
a bit o’ style you have
to 'andle ’em diff’rent.
So, in spite of ’im pesterin’ me, I wouldn’t
introduce Alec to my little actress friend. Not
that I was frightened of him cutting me out.
Not a bit. I give you my word. I ain’t very
big, but I know my way around.
No, the truth is Alec is a trifle, just a trifle,
common. His father has a butcher’s shop, and
Alec drives for him. Butchering coarsens one, I
think. The grocery business is much more
genteel. I’m in that line myself. (My little
friend somehow got the idea that I was in a ship-
ping office, and I didn’t think it worth while to
tell’er diffrent.) Imagine how annoyed I was,
as I waited there anxiously at the stage-door, to
see Alec come round the corner of the street.
He was dressed out very flashly in a loud striped
suit, with a big, brassy-looking watch-chain across
his chest, and his hat on the back of his head,
showing a big, oily curl over his forehead. He
had a large cigar between his teeth. He was
good-lookin’ enough in a common sort of way.
“ ’Ullo ! ” he said, as if he was surprised to see
me; “ what are you doing here ?”
“ I have to meet someone—a lady,” I answered,
coldly. I didn’t want to be seen talking to him
when Stella came out. But I couldn’t shake him
off. He wouldn’t take a hint. Said he was
waiting for someone, too. An absolute lie ! He
wanted me to introduce him to Stella. Well, he
could want, I vowed to myself. I never reckoned
’e could be so low as to do what ’e done.
Presently the girls began to come out. Stella
come along soon, talkin’ to another girl.
“ Hook it, now,” I hissed in Alec's ear ; but e
took no notice—just went on talking. Just as
they reached the door, Stella dropped the little
handbag off her wrist. Only a little bag it was,
but it was marvellous what she could cram into
it. A handkerchief, a purse full o’ coppers, a
powder-puff, a cracked mirror, a train ticket,
some dress samples, a buttonhook, some postage
stamps, and goodness knows what else.
I started forward to pick it up, but Alec got
the start of me, and, pushing me to one side,
picked it up. ’E took off ’is hat and gave it to
her, with a bow. The bounder ! I’d have struck
him, big as he is, if it hadn’t been for the ladies
bein’ present.
Stella smiled and looked up at ’im under her
heye-lashes, an’ thanked him, and Alec looked at
her hard (the cad!) and said not to mention it ;he
was glad to be of service to ’er because he admired
her dancing so much, and wanted to get acquainted
to her badly; so that when his friend ’ere (mean-
ing me) asked him along to supper, he said he
was delighted. That fairly took my breath away.
The cheek, the cool, stupenderous cheek of him !

ILLUSTRATING A SCHOOL PRIMER-
It knocked me speechless. Before I could get in
a word, Alec had asked Stella’s friend along to
supper too. She giggled an' said she d be
charmed. Alec introduced her to me. Maggie
Doyle was ’er name, an’ she was as ugly as a
Scotch haggis.
“You bring Miss Doyle along,” said Alec,
taking Stella by the arm and moving off.
“ Here, hold on,” I shouted after him.
“ Hurry up ! ” he said over his shoulder. “ The
girls must be starving.”
Well, there was nothing for it but to chase after
them with Stella’s ugly friend.
“Where are we going?” asked Stella, when
we caught them up.
“ Why,” said I, “ we'll go to the little ’am-an’-
beef shop down the street, as usual.”
“What!” yelled Alec, turning round (but
without letting go Stella’s arm). “ I’m surprised
at you. Take ladies like these here to a ’am-an’-
beef shop ! We’ll go to the very best cafey in
this town and order the very best supper they’ve
got, that’s what we’ll do, so don’t you argue.”
And with that he went off with Stella before I
could hutter a syllable.
I could have killed ’im. I give you my word.
Still, I hope I’m too much of a gentleman to
make a scene before ladies. So I swallowed my
rage (though it did near choke me) and walked
behind listenin’ dazedly to Miss Doyle’s remarks
as to what a fine, gentlemanly fellow my friend,
Mr. ’lggens, seemed.
When we got to the cafey the place was
crowded, and at first we could only get room for
two. Alec suggested that Miss Doyle and I
should sit down and start, and ’e and Stella’d
wait.
He was calling her “Stella” by now, and
“ Kiddie ” too, most affectionate. The cad! I
looked to see Stella turn and wither ’im up like
I’ve seen ’er do if anyone took a liberty with her.
But all she said was: “Oh, no, Alec, let’s all
wait” “Alec” mind vou—and I thought she
was 'refined and ladylike ! Well, a man makes
mistakes at times.
Presently a waiter came along and said there
was a table just vacant at the far end of the room.
We had to walk right down the cafey, through the
crowds of people, most of ’em terrible swells, too.
kne w oOhem by sight through saving’em
in the shop. It made me terrible nervous. I
tripped over everything. But Alec just strode
along as if th« plane belonged to him, and as if he
come there to supper every night of his life. Here
and there he’d give a nod or a bow as if he saw
someone he knew, and I could see it impressed
the girls no end. He had the cheek of the Devil.
. After he had taken Stella’s fur off and sat down
next to her, Alec started in to order the supper,
He seemed to pick out all the most expensive
dishes he could find, and ordered the waiter to
get a hustle on. The waiter, who had eyed us
&
kind of doubtfully when we first come in, bowed
and rubbed his hands and said: “ Yessir ; very
good, sir! ” and rushed off. Alec leant back in
his chair and looked round the room with a
lordly air, and nodded to some more imaginary
acquaintances. . _
I could see it went big with the girls, so i
thought I’d butt into the game. I looked round
presently, and said:
“Why, there’s Fitzgomery ! ” and waved my
’and airily to the far end of the cafey.
“ Why, I’m surprised at you,” said Alec.
“ What’s the matter ? ” I asked him.
“ Fancy recognising a man like that,’ said
Alec, as if he was disgusted. “When you’re
with ladies, too.” . ,
By the time I could explain that it wasn t the
Fitzgomery he knew that I was friendly with, he
wasn’t listening. He was leaning over Stella
whisperin’ confidential into her ear.
“Do you often come here?” she asked him,
presently.
“Not often,” said Alec, off-hand. Some-
times one runs into very common people here.
“Yes,” I put in, “the Russell-street coftee-
stall’s more in your line, ain t it ?
He glared across at me and muttered something
about “vulgar jokes.’’ Then what do you think
the bounder did ? Picked up a bit of lump sugar,
looked at it, tossed it over to me and said :
“ That’s good sugar, ain’t it ? ’Ow much a pound,
now, would that be ? ”
Of course I went red, and Stella looked at me
in surprise. “ What do you know about sugar ?
she asked.
“Well, you see, I—er —that is—er—my ship-
pin’ company do a lot o’ business with Mauritius.
Alec started to laugh and roll about on his chair
most vulgarly.
“ What’s tickling you ?” I snapped.
“Nothin’,” he said, wiping his eye on the
corner of the tablecloth. “Something struck
me.”
“ Something else’ll strike you if you am t care-
ful,” I told him. (
“ Gam ! Go home and grow ! ’ said Alec.
“ Oh, please don’t quarrel ! ” cried Stella.
“Well, let ’im try and behave himself like a
gentleman when ’e is with gentlefolk, said Alec.
“Yes,” said Stella to me, “you’re very bad-
tempered to-night. I think you ought to apolo-
gise to Alec here.”
There’s no telling what’d have happened, be-
cause my blood was fairly up, if the waiter hadn t
come along just then with the soup.
It was a rotten meal. Alec talked all the time,
and I could only sit and glare at him. The lies
he told ! F’rinstance, he suddenly give a twinge
and said : “ It’s going to rain.
“ What makes you think so ? ” asked Stella.
“My old wound always begins to play
up,” he answered, pulling up his sleeve and
showing a scar on
his arm where he got
gashed once at the
abattoirs.
“Oh my ! ” gasped
the girls. “ What a ter-
rible scar ! ’Ow did
you come by it ? ”
“ In the Boer War,"
’e told them—the liar !
Him what’s never been
outside Victoria !
“ Did you go to the
war, too ?’’ asked Miss
Doyle of me.
“ No," said Alec, be-
fore I could get out a
word for myself. “He
volunteered all right ;
terrible anxious to go
he was ; cried like a
kid when they passed
him out ’cos he was too
small."
That was the limit.
That broke me up. I
leant across the table
and looked him in the
eye.
“ Now look here,
you," I shouted fiercely,
“ I’ve met a few
low ”
“By Jove!” he in-
terrupted, jumping up.
“Just look at the time !
The girls ’ll miss their
last train! We must
scoot ! You fix up the
bill, and I’ll see the
ladies to the station!
Come on, girls!"
Then, before I knew
what was happening, I
was left alone in the
cafey with a waiter
handing me a bill what
made my blood run cold.
It took me half an
hour to convince him
that I wasn’t a take-
down ; nor was it till
I’d left my name and
address, together with
my watch and chain
and all my loose cash,
that I could get away.
Of course, I’d missed
my last train, and had
to walk ’ome. Alec
’lggens refused to pay
me for the supper when
I tackled him. Said I’d
invited ’im along.
Now every night he
waits outside the stage
door for Stella. Well,
he can have her. I’ve
no use for her. If she
thinks she can play fast
an’ loose with me she’ll
find she’s made a mis-
take. We all has our
faults, and mine is pride.
I give you my word.
Some day I'll get even
with Alec ’lggens. ’E’s
no bloomin’ gentleman. It isn’t so> much that I
mind him skiting to the boys how he cut
me out. But when the cow brings her into the
shop just when things are busiest and orders a
pound o’ lump sugar —well, I reckon Vs lacking
in all gentlemanly instincts.

The Timber Scow.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SQUAT and low in the sea she wallows,
Booms a-swing to a sea which follows ;
Sullen to answer her guiding hand —
A timber scow out of Maoriland.
Manned by descendants of Viking races ;
Brawny and brown, with salt-rimed faces.
Facing the fierce nor’-western wind,
Battle the watery leagues behind.
Her deck is sodden as each wave passes,
Sowing the seed of the salt sea-grasses ;
Brine-soaked and low as a shoal of sand,
A wallowing scow out of Maoriland.
Bare brown spars that are long and limber ;
Decks that are loaded with wave-washed timber,
Sprawling along o’er the sea they ride,
Bound for somewhere on Pyrmont side.
Only a waterlogged timber scow —
As a liner passes with spuming prow.
Only a crew who are burnt and brown,
A hundred leagues out of Auckland town.

The Island of Rest.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN the Isle of sweet Cairn, where the cocoanut
palm
Nods dreamily over your head*
Your life is a swoon through a long afternoon,
From the day that you’re born till you’re dead—
At any rate, so it is said.
You swoon and you croon, and it’s one afternoon
From the day that you’re born till you’re dead.
As you lie at your ease you are fanned by the
breeze
That sighs through the cinnamon groves ;
And the breath you inhale from the spice-laden
gale
Has a far-off suggestion of cloves.
Then fondly your memory roves ;
In the gale you inhale you will fondly regale
In a faint recollection of cloves.
They say you exist in an opiate mist
That soothes all your senses to sleep ;
And you 101 l as you lave in the somnolent wave
Of a not at all treacherous deep
On the sands where the surges do sweep ;
The wave is your slave as you lazily lave
In the not at all treacherous deep.
They say to you, too, that you’ve nothing to do,
In that island of uttermost rest,
But bask in the shade of a tropical glade
With your head on a nut-colored breast—
For the nut-colored bosom is best ;
And the maid of that shade in a tropical glade
Is the unit of absolute rest.
I am thinking of flight to that isle of delight ;
For I'm sure I should like bo be there,
To swim and to spoon by the lulling lagoon,
With a maiden you couldn’t call fair,
And to look at the stars through her hair ;
To spoon neath the moon by the lulling lagoon—
Oh, what would I give to be there !
Now, before I set sail, and for fear I should fail
To grasp alt the pleasures in store,
They tell me that Brookes, and the Simpsons and
Snooks
Flave gone to that beautiful shore.
Why didn’t they say so before ?
One looks to find Snooks by the babblesome
Brookes,
But not on that beautiful shore !
Then the smart Mrs. Gay, she went over in May,
And the folks of her set wondered why,
Till Major Muldoon took the steamer in June,
And his wife followed on in July !
And still silly people asked why.
But the spoony Muldoon had a warm afternoon,
Although it was only July.
But that’s only some of the joys that have come
To bless that sweet isle of the sea,
For the Reverend Jinks is a don on the links,
And an angel at afternoon tea.
How peaceful that island must be !
One thinks of the jinks that are played on the
links,
And sighs for that isle of the sea.
Then the swift Doctor Jim, with his motor boat
trim,
And one or two others with cars,
Like to take out a maid that is not over-staid,
And stay out to study the stars —
A thing no convention debars.
It is said by the staid when a maid is delayed
That she stayed out to study the stars.
There’s euchre and larks at the Cooks’ and the
Clarkes',
And Bridge at the Browns’ every night;
d here s snooker and pool when the evenings are
cool,
And bowls by acetylene light,
And barefooted croquet’s all right ;
You may fool in a pool when the evening’s not
cool,
But you don t want acetylene light.
You may sport in the surf if you like, or the turf,
For races are run on the Square ;
But the best fun of all is the Resident’s ball,
When the girls say they've nothing to wear—
And they haven’t too much, you could swear—
But they all have a call to the Resident’s ball,
To show you they’ve nothing to wear.
So that island of bliss, where the cocoanuts kiss
The sun and the stars and the sky,
And the nutmegs and mace both remember their
place,
Not to grate on your nose or your eye—
That isle where the cinnamons sigh
Is the place to efface every thought that is base ;
And we’re all going there by-and-bye.

The Hilarious Motor.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AT eleven o clock on Saturday morning,
Wilson, walking down Collins-street, ran
up against George Berwick, just back from
five years in the Territory. Wilson seized George
with one hand, hailed a hansom with the other,
and in less than a minute they were whirling
along to the Wanderers’ Club, laughing like
schoolboys and asking each other about every
minute, “ Well, old boy, what the d 1 have
you been doing all this time ? ”
When they arrived at the Club they made for
the smoke-room, ordered the drinks, and started
to yarn. In five years a lot can happen to two
men. They had a good deal to talk about, and
tts talking is dry work, they kept a solemn waiter
going in and out with trays and glasses for four
delightful hours. Then Wilson, during a slight
pause, looked at his watch and was filled with
amazement.
“Well Im d d!” he muttered, looking
blankly at George.
Berwick looked at Wilson with eyes that had
just a hint of sleep in their blue depths. “ Whas-
ser matter, Jim ? ”
Wilson pursed up his lips and looked excess-
ively solemn. “George, my boy, d’ye know it’s
three o'clock ! ”
George smiled and blinked wearily. “ No, yer
don’t ! Yer carn’t stuff me, ole chap ! ”
Wilson turned his watch face round, and Ber-
wick —who seemed to have some slight difficulty
in seeing the hands—leant over and peered at it.
“Watch’s wrong!” he said, and leant back
again.
Wilson rose with an air of resolution and
handed his friend his cane. “Come ’long,
George ! Carn’t sit here all day drinkin’ whisky.
Come "long !” I hen he led the way out, and
Berwick followed blindly.
Outside, waiting at the kerb, they found the
Motor. It was a big green car that looked as if
it could travel, and Wilson’s eye rested on it
approvingly.
“ Hullo ! ” he said, “ I didn’t see Tack go in.”
“Eh, Jim?”
“I said I didn’t see Jack go in t’ th’ Club.
There’s his motor ! ”
“ Well, what ’ bout it?”
Wilson looked back over his shoulder and
chuckled. “Care fr a ride?” he whispered.
“ Let’s borrer th’ thing an’ go f’r a little ride
roun’ town. Goon, George, get in!”
George made a little run at the green motor
and scrambled on to the front seat. Wilson
threw his cane over the back, gave the handle in
front a twist that set the big thing throbbing, and
jumped in beside his friend.
“ Are yer right? ”
“ Yesh, I’m orright !”
“ Well, hoi’ on t’ yer hat.”
A touch of the lever, a half turn of the wheel, a
jolt forward, and, before they knew it, they were
half-way down the street on the wrong side.
As they rolled luxuriously along Wilson asked
George in an off-hand sort of way if he had done
much motoring.
George said he hadn't.
“Neither have I,” said Wilson, “but I’m
stremely fond of it. Been out with Jack two-
three times. Don’ know much about it ’cept
how t’ start it. Look outl ”
The green monster skated like a thing of life
round the fat policeman on point duty, and rushed
with an angry hum at the steep hill. Straight up
the slope it flashed, and Wilson swore furiously to
George about the way policemen stand in the
middle of the road and hold up their hands.
“ Mighter killed him,” he yelled, and George
said, regretfully, “ Why didn’t yer?”
The car reached the top of Collins-street, then
turned almost of its own accord and swept down
the Spring-street hill, where the wind, in a
riotous mood, snatched off Wilson's hat and blew
FRENZIED FINANCE.

it into a tree top. Wilson laughed, skimmed the
corner of the Treasury Gardens, and gave the
green flier her head down the hill. The effect
was remarkable. A sedate Richmond tram,
ambling along ahead at about 12 miles an hour’
seemed to suddenly stop and slide backwards past
them. The gripman on it was looking intently
ahead ; an old gentleman in front, with his hands
folded over the knob of his stick, was doing like-
wise ; and the conductor on the back platform was
staring moodily at those on the dummy. Yet the
whole thing, unknown to the occupants, was
slipping backwards to the city from which it had
just emerged ! Wilson and George yelled wdth
laughter, and the car, with the dust whirling up
behind like dense smoke, zig-zagged along the
HIS SOLE MEANS OF SUPPORT.

road like an immense bloodhound nosing a hot
scent. Before they recovered they were up the
Wellington Parade hill, and streaking along the
level with a blurred line of houses racing by them
on one hand, and on the other a moving carpet of
green grass and trees that flickered and flashed
for a few brief seconds, and then rushed away
altogether over their right shoulder. Immediately
afterwards there was a pantomime in the narrow
switchback of Bridge-road.
A stout girl with a basket was watching her
aged mother cross the road. She heard three
hoarse hoots. She looked up and saw a pillar of
dust that looked like smoke. Another deafening
hoot and a streak of green leaped out of the murk,
skidded madly six inches from her parent, hooted
in triumph and was gone ! The stout girl
dropped her basket in the road and screamed, and
other people with baskets rushed out of grocers
shops and butchers’ premises to view the remains.
They were disappointed and offended when they
found an uninjured woman standing upright and
shrieking. By the time the fat girl had explained
herself and started home in hysterics, the dust had
settled, and the green car was out of sight, flying
along the broad stretch to the bridge.
Just here George leant over to Wilson and
howled in his ear, “ All pleecemen seem t’ know
you, Jim.'’
Wilson turned an inquiring eye, and the car
swayed ominously. “ How’s that, ole chap ?”
“ They’re all wavin’ t’ yer ! ” shouted George.
He pointed to an almost round sergeant, who was
standing on the footpath and signalling vigor-
ously.
Wilson swore and did something that made the
car purr a little louder, and sent the landscape
reeling by them at a perfectly maddening rate.
A jolt, a shout, a gleam of water far below,
and then Hawthorn was speeding after Rich-
mond.
The rush through the air was telling on George.
His eyes opened and shut spasmodically, and
his head responded to every roll and swerve of
the car as it flew onward. Consciousness seemed
to be drifting from him. Later on, he revived
somewhat and began to ask questions.
“ I s-a-ay, Jim. ”
“ Yesh, ole boy ? ”
“ Whasser matter with all damn streets ? ”
“ Why, ole chap ? ”
“ Whatter they all slidin' inter town for ? ”
* * » *
“Jim ! ”
“ Yesh, ole man ? ”
“ How many pleecemen, d’yer know ? ”
“ Only one.”
“ Well, what they all wavin’ at ? ”
“ They want t’ make us stop, ol’ chap.”
“ Well, why don’ they stop ? ”
“ Jim ! ”
“ Well, George ? ’’
“ Where’s th’ horse ? ”
“ What horse ? ’ ’
“ Th’ horse that’s pullin’ this buggy ? ”
“ There isn't any horse ! ”
George let it go at that. After thinking it over
for a minute, he muttered distractedly, Well,
I’m damned if / know ! ”
It was all green countryside now. Post-and-
rail fences streamed away to right and left, hills
swept along like enormous waves, and dived
under the racing wheels, and the blue ranges in
the distance came steadily on like ships to meet
them. 1
They lurched and swung over a hilltop and
went singing down the slope towards a sleepy
country town.
Wilson stirred George, and told him to wake
up. . George,” he said, “if yer see a pleece-
man, insult him as we go by. Sing out somethin’
to him. I’ll slow down so’s he can hear it ! ”
“ What’ll I say ? ”
“ Oh, say anythin’. Shake yer fist at him and
hoot him ! ”
Fate decreed they should sight the necessary
policeman. He was a thin, savage-looking man,
and, as soon as he sighted them, Wilson slowed
down to a twelve-mile-an-hour gait. As the con-
stable turned to look at them, George, half-
asleep, shook his fist and howled, “ Oh-h, you
loafer 1 You loafer 1 800 ! ”
The policeman started as if he had been stung.
The next instant he bounded off in pursuit of the
car, and had almost reached it before Wilson,
who was rocking with laughter, shifted the gear
up and jumped out of reach.
“ Stop ! ” yelled the infuriated policeman, as
he rushed after them. “Stop !”
“Oh-h, you loafer ! howled George, kneeling
up on the seat. “ You smoc.dger ! ”
“ STOP—THAT—CAR !. . . STOP IT ! ”
“800 '. . . YOU LOAFER !”
Here Wilson, shrieking with laughter, did
something that the green motor resented, and it
stopped—stopped dead, ten paces in front of the
maddest policeman that ever lived.


George, who was under the impression that the
thing was still flying along, continued to jeer and
shake his fist until the panting constable rushed
up and started to drag him out by the collar.
<< Wharrer yer doin' ? ” he grunted, angrily, as
he stumbled out and nearly bumped his captor
over. ‘ ‘ Wha’ tli’ Devil yer doin' ? ”
“ I'll soon show yer !” puffed the policeman.
“ I’ll fix you chaps up nicely for this ! ”
Wilson, shaking with mirth, got out and told
the policeman it “would be orright, and not t
worry ’bout it any more.”
You mind yer own bisness ! ’ snapped the
man, with his hand on George’s arm.
Wilson sobered visibly, and an angry gleam
came into his eye. He stepped to the side of the
arresting constable and looked at him. I his s
my bisness ! ” he said, taking hold of George s
other arm. ,
George, with his hat over one eye, looked from
one to the other dazedly. “ Wha’s all fuss
’bout?” he asked, with a very mild show of
interest. . )
“ Let go that man’s arm ! He’s a pns ner.
Wilson looked at him scornfully. “ Don’ be a
blankv fool ! ” he sneered.
“ That’ll do ! ” shouted the constable ; “you re
under arrest as well as him ! ”
“ Don’ be absurd ! ” said Wilson. “ Don be
ridic’l's, my fren’ —you’re makin’ fool of yerself.”
The constable, seeing that George wasn’t in-
terested, and that he was merely holding him up
when he might just as well be sitting down,
shoved him towards the motor and turned furi-
ously on Wilson. George climbed back into the
vehicle unnoticed.
“ That'll do ! I don’ want t’ hear anything
more from you ! ”
“ Orright,” said Wilson, and, turning round,
he got into the motor and went to start it.
The constable jumped on the step and tried to
crowd in beside George. Wilson fended him off
with one mighty arm and asked him what the
H —l he wanted.
“Drive t’ th’ station !” commanded the con-
stable.
<’ Get off ! ” grunted Wilson, pushing him off
the ste P- . . . ,
Livid with rage, the policeman whipped oti,
and, opening the door at the back, got in and sat
down. .
“ Drive on ! ” he repeated, with a savage smile
of triumph.
Wilson looked at him sitting there, chuckled
deep down in his throat, and started the motor
with a jolt that sent the policeman’s helmet roll-
ing into the road.
“ Wait a minute, can’t you ! " shouted the man,
but Wilson only moved her up to a 20-mile-an-
hour gait and fled like the wind for the hills.
In a minute they were well clear of the village
and racing at express speed along a lonely road.
The policeman leant over Wilson s shoulder
and asked him, “ Are you going t’ turn back ?
“ No, my frien’, I’m not /’’
“ Well, I’m not goin’ t’ jump out, y’ know !”
“ If yer do v’ll break yer blanky neck ! ”
“Then I'm goin’ with yer wherever yer
bound ! ”
“ Yer’ve got t ’ ! ”
After that the conversation flagged.
It was George who started things going again.
Happening to turn round, he saw the man with-
out a hat, and immediately nudged Wilson.
“Who’s yer frien’ ?” he inquired, hoarsely.
“ Pleeceman,” said Wilson, in a tohe of utter
contempt.
George, turning round, regarded the intrudei
with a frown, and asked Wilson what he was
doing in the car.
“He’s just arrested you !” Wilson informed him.
George snorted in a warlike
fashion.
‘ ‘ I'm sure ! ”
GONE UP.
MOTHER : “ What is the matter , Bertie? Why
do you look so miserable? ”
BERTIE : " Oh, I was out in the paddock flying
my kite , and it went tip —and up—and up
and then God sneaked it! ”
“ Fact, ole chap ! ”
“ Wha’ for?”
‘ ‘ Callin’ him a loafer. ”
A pleased but half incredulous look came over
George’s face, and his eyes twinkled. “Did I, Jim?”
“ Yesh, ole boy, you did! ”
George laughed. “Well, so he is a loafer !"
“ O’ course he is ! ’’ responded Wilson enthusi-
astically.
“ Will I chuck him out ? ” inquired George.
Before Wilson could reply, the constable, red
and furious, leant over again and commanded
Wilson to stop the car. They were miles from

any habitation on a lonely back road where
there were no witnesses. The request was, there-
fore, a reasonable one, and Wilson complied.
The discussion was then resumed to the sooth-
ing accompaniment of the crickets and frogs. The
sun was going down in a blaze of red glory, the
shadows were lengthening, and the whole visible
world was steeped in a profound and exquisite
peace. Only in the car, motionless in the middle
of the road, was there discord and strife.
George first of all proposed that he should fight
the policeman, but Wilson said firmly that that
wouldn’t do at all. “ No, George ! What I
say is this ; give the man a few bob an’ tell him t
go home.’’ .
“Give him nothing !” shouted George, indig-
nantly. “ Give him nothing , and tell him t’ go t
th’ Devil ! ’’
“ Carn’t do that, George ! ”
“ Well, lemme chuck him out ! ”
Here the police-
man burst into the
argument. “There
sn’t goin’ t’ be

shouted ;
“there’s goin’ t’ be

‘‘ Pm sure ! ”
snorted George.
“ Yes, my boy,
there is ! ”
“ Ah-h-h, get y’
head read ! ” re-
torted George
offensively.
“You seem t’
fergit who yer talk-
in’ to ! ”
“No!” correct-
ed George, an-
grily, “ I don ’
ferget I don’
even know who
I’m talking to !
I don’ know yer
name, an’ I don’
want t’ know

what’s more,
if yer try t’ tell
me yer name,
I’ll tell yer t’

that quite clear

“ Stop that ! ” yelled the kidnapped policeman.
“ I won’ stop ! I wouldn’t stop Pr th’ bes’

“ I’ll show you ’oo I am later on.’’
“ No, f r Heaven’s sake, don’t ! I ’sure you 1
don’t feel slightes’ interest in you. I think you’re
damn nuisance. It makes me ’stremely tired to
talk t’ yer ! ”
The constable leant over until his nose almost
touched George's, and said in an impressive, red-
faced voice, “ Now you listen t’ me ! If I ”
But Wilson pushed him away from George and
interrupted, “NO ! You listen t ! me l If I give
you fiver ”• — 5
“ I don’ want none of yer money ! Moneys
no good to ME ! ! ”
Wilson immediately turned his back, and re-
marked plaintively to the evening landscape,
“ MAD !. , . lie’s MAD !’ j
George’s eyes closed, his head rolled back
against the seat cushions, and he was oblivious of
afl the world —including policemen.
A frog near at hand struck up in the stillness.
Wilson lit a cigar, and settled down to enjoy the
peaceful eventide.
The bareheaded constable mopped his brow
with his handkerchief and thought things over
while he cooled off. The gentle breeze from the
hills caressed his purple forehead and whispered
to him a message of peace and goodwill towards
men —especially men in motors with fivers to give
away. What was the good of making a fuss?
Who would get the benefit ? The Government !
The great senseless Government that kept him
gaoled up in a dead country town while the best
years of his life went by. He coughed.
Wilson flicked the ash off his cigar, and turned
with a friendly smile. “ Beg pardon, ole chap ? ”
“ You was sayin’ somethin’ just now, sir?”
Wilson produced a folded slip of paper from
his pocket and passed it over with a wink.
“ Good luck, ole man. Hope you’re not ’fended
with us. No harm meant y’ know.”
“ That’s all right, sir ! Thank yer, sir ! Now,
if yer don’ min', sir, I think I'd better be gettin’
back. Th’ sergeant might ”
George gave a long, contented snore.
Wilson glanced at him, and a wild light of joy
shone in his eye. He beckoned the constable
to incline his ear.
“Do you min’,” he whispered. “Do you
min’ goin’ ’way as quietly as possible. I want t
play joke on my frien’here.”
The man grinned. “ Yessir, certainly.
“Which way d'ye go back? Across the
paddicks? ”
“ Yes, sir, I do go back that way.”
“That’s good. I don’ want him t’ wake up
and see yer.”
“Orright, sir, I'll go now.”
“ Orright, ole chap. Goo' bye. ’
“ Good-bye, sir. An’—thank yer, sir.’
“Don’ mention it, ole chap. S’long 1”
The constable got out as gently as possible,
and tip-toed across the road. Then he got
through the post-and-rail fence, grinned a final
good-bye, and, with a wave of the hand, disap-
peared in the scrub.
Wilson settled down again to finish his cigar,
whilst George snored the bass part of a trio with
the crickets and frogs.
In about ten minutes Wilson flung away the
butt of his Havana, and poked George gently in
the ribs.
“Wake up, George! Time t’ be gettm
home ! ” _ .
George came to life, stretching and blinking.
Three-quarters awake, he turned round in his seat
and searched the back compartment of the car
with his eyes. Then he peered about the road,
and at last looked up in the trees.
“ Where’s pleeceman ? ” he demanded.
Wilson, without a word, went to the front of
the car and gave the crank a wrench. The en-
gine started to throb, and he got in and made
preparations to start.
“ Where’s pleeceman, Jim ? ”
Wilson regarded him with a perfectly expres-
sionless face. “ What pleeceman, George ? ”
“ Th’ copper we had in th’ car !
Wilson shook his head and sent the green
motor rolling on the homeward track.
George woke up properly and grew clamorous.
Nothing but a policeman would satisfy him. Wil-
son shook his head some more, and put up the
speed so that George had to shriek his inquiries.
Wilson kept on shaking his head.
“ But, Jim —there was a pleeceman, wasn't
there ? ”
“ Not with us, ole chap ! ”
“ On yer honor ! ”
“ Gospel truth ! ”
“ Well—l muster dreamt him ! ”
“ I s’pose so ! ”
“ How long was I ’sleep?”
“ Nearly all the afternoon, George.”
George slapped his knee and cackled with
delight. “My word, that was a dream ! ”
“ What wps it, George?”
A sleepy laugh as the car lurched over the brow
of the hill.
“Tha’s th’Test d d dream I ever had !
Marvell’s —absolutely marvell’s ! ”
“ Well, d nit all ! yer might tell a chap ! ”
Another laugh. . . . Marvell's !! ”
The car rushed on through the dusk.
KODAK.
Boney.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I MET, one day, with Boney,
By chance, beside the Sea ;
No gay-garbed toff and tony
Might my acquaintance be ;
For Truth’s sweet sake, I own he
Was e’en a Portugee,
Who schnapper, bream, and tailer
Purveyed for loaves or beers.
A fisher now ; a sailor
He’d been in other years,
When old Ben Boyd, the whaler,
Had use for harpooneers.
Outside the hostel, loudly
The passing ships a-gleam
With paint and brasswork proudly
Went up or down the stream ;
Each dockyard miss avow dly
A serving-maid of Steam.
The Age of Iron round us
In clash and clamor lay ;
And strict convention bound us
To methods of To-day ;
Yet Fancy somehow found us
And bore us far away.
We each were scant of money
That morn beside the sea ;
With pert contempt En&ne
Served out our “ thrippenny ’
One rum set up by Boney,
And one set up by me.
Hard bit by Fate, together •
We spake of other shores,
And saw a white surf feather
Plis far-off high Azores,
Where, in wild Western weather,
The loud Atlantic roars.
And then —not greatly caring
For either place or time —
But back in mern’ry faring
To other land and clime,
All scorned convention daring,
I hummed a deep-sea rhyme !
Fie met it at the chorus,
That half-forgotten song ;
The new world lay before us ;
For either right or wrong
We rolled —our glasses o’er us—
The old world right along !
“ Then, oh , I've got to leave you,
Though all the winds may blow ;
Don't let my parting grieve you ,
Shell-ho, my lass, shell-ho ;
Tm sorry to deceive you,
But I am bound to go."
With shame, I’m called to own he
Was “ low ” as I was “ high
No virtuoso Boney,
And no Caruso I
The scorn of fair Enone
Was written in her eye.
We roared that chantey over,
With ne’er a windlass pawl—-
The chantey of the lover,
Who hears the deep seas call
The old carousing rover
Beneath his topmasts tall.
’Twas neither right nor seeming ;
The mistress of the place
Proclaimed with dark eyes gleaming
Our sentence of disgrace,
Although a tear was streaming
Down Boney’s furrowed face.
For just a moment only
He’d glimpsed with inward eye
The great seas heaving lonely
Beneath another sky,
In other years that pronely
In Time’s deep graveyards lie.
Outside that hostel stately
The twin screws churned the bay,
All things pronouncing greatly
The march of modern day ;
And forth I walked sedately,
And Boney went his way.
But when I meet with Boney
Good friends henceforth we be ;
We ape no liquors toney,
But faithful stingaree
We ask from pert Enhne,
And yarn beside the sea.

The Land of Laissez Faire.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THEY never meddle with the laws, or muddle
with the Past,
They always say the state of things to-day
is bound to last ;
They never regulate a watch, or stoop to clean a
drain —
The smells you move (they truly say) will soon
come back again ;
The things we have are sacred, and the Future
will be right,
In case we don’t go flooding it with too much
foolish light.
Their motto’s “ It don't matter,” and their flag’s
“Away wi’ Care,”
For Life’s a sweet Go Lucky in the Land of
Laissez Faire.
It lies, the Land of Laissez Faire, by seas of
Drowsy Head ;
Its hearts are mainly wooden and its brains are
mainly lead ;
It goes to sleep at sunset, and it snores until the
day;
Its voice is loud and vacant, and it borders on the
bray ;
Its chronic song is “ Rock-a-bye,” or
“ Drift Along the Stream ” ;
It likes to dream of working, and L its
work is all a dream.
O, change is deemed a wicked
thing, and energy a snare
By them, the drooping, drowsy
heads who live in Laissez

They tell you Wrong will

you show it doesn’t,
They say : “You speak

wicked man, you

The land you’re in is good
enough—it’s free of
bond and fetter,
And would you dare with
changeful hand to try
to make it better ?
The things that have been
handed down you’d only
make them worse
By muddling them to fashions new
beneath a meddling curse ;
And as to mending customs old—
however could you dare
To think of such a rascal thing ? they cry in
Laissez Faire.
They say :, “Our noble ancestors were men of
massive brain,
And what they did was beautiful, and ever must
remain.
If plague and pest oppress us we should sleep
without alarm,
And trust the gods that succor foois to guard us
all from harm ;
For what is now it always was, and ’tisn’t worth

To rouse up from our slumbers and disturb our

And so they dream and dawdle on and rever turn

Until the Trump of Judgment wakes the dead in

BOLTON’S MOTHER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ONE pleasing feature of Manager Mackenzie’s
character was his robust dislike to gaoling
anybody ; and if the culprit had an aged
mother, or some pretty female relations who had
no dirty pride about them, he would make strenu-
ous efforts to avoid doing anything unpleasant.
As far as the traffic office knew, Bolton hadn't
a relation in the. world, except the giddy old uncle
whose influence'had got him into the department.
The said influence, having placed him there,
seemed to have got suddenly tired, and was never
again exerted on his behalf. So, when Manager
Mackenzie read Bolton’s private and confidential
note to the effect that he had embezzled of
deposit account moneys, and didn’t know what to
do, he put the letter down and breathed hard.
He leaned over to Knutsford, and the gloom on
his face told the Plodder that someone had been
kicking over the traces. He passed the letter to
the young man with a few well-chosen objurga-
tions, and then leaned back in his chair and
chewed the end of his green cigar.
It was the custom of the Maoriland Railway
Department to compound felonies. If a man’s
friends paid up, the embezzler sent in his resigna-
tion along with the restored money, and received
a non-committal sort of reference, which merely
stated he had been so many years in the service,
but said nothing about his conduct. It was not
writfen on the usual form, but on a piece of
ordinary foolscap on which the official rubber,
stamp made frequent play.
So the manager instructed Knutsford to write a
note to Bolton, informing him that if he could
raise the money he would be allowed to resign.
But the money must be forthcoming in a week ;
otherwise —the jug.
While Knutsford engrossed this ultimatum
there came a faint knock at the door, and the
secretary, looking out, found an aged lady with a
sweet old face and a mass of snow-white hair.
She was dressed in very plainly-made clothes of
cheap black material. A sprig of heliotrope in
her bonnet gave her face a softness and refine-
ment that quite took Knutsford’s heart.
She was very nervous, and inquired if the
manager would be good enough to see her alone.
She would not detain him long. Knutsford
seated her in the ante-room, and then reported to
Mackenzie, who was still considerably ruffled by
the news that he had another cash deficit on his
section.
“ Old, is she ; and worried, you say. No, I
don’t feel inclined to listen to old ladies’ woes
this morning. Just explain to her that I’m very,
very busy indeed, and that you are the well-
beloved and trusty viceroy, and fix her up some-
how. This show isn’t a charitable relief board. ”
Knutsford went back and explained the situa-
tion to the trembling old lady in the ante-room.
She seemed greatly distressed, and then she
looked hard at the secretary :
HE WANTED HIS DINNER.
PARSON : "Now that you are about to leave
this sinful world , join with me in a few
words of prayer. ”
GREENHIDE BILL: “Be as quick as you can;
'cos I want to get to Heaven by one o'clock .”
“ You’ve a winsome face, sir, and perhaps I
might do worse than tell you. I’m Eddie Bolton’s
mother, an’ I want to plead with Mr. Mackenzie
for my poor wayward boy. He’s a good son, and
I’m afraid this trouble is owing to his helping me
so liberally. He’s a good boy, indeed, to his
mother, and I thought perhaps Mr. Mackenzie
might see his way clear to give him another
chance if I explained things to him.”
Knutsford looked at her sympathetically. This
was a new development.
“ Does he maintain you ? ” he queried.
“ He does, he does ; he’s a very good boy to
me, indeed he is ! ”
“ Well, that fact will not do him any harm. I
cannot make any promises, but I think I can sug-
gest a way in which Mr. Mackenzie can help him.
Tell your son to come in this afternoon.”
The old lady smiled tremulously, and dabbed
her eyes 'lightly with her handkerchief. Then
she suddenly seized Knutsford’s paw in both
hands, and expressed her envy of his mother.
That is a little way common to the mothers and
wives of embezzlers.
* • * *
It was nearly 4.30 p. m. when Bolton arrived.
He was anything but faultlessly arrayed. In
fact, he wore a ready-made suit —a thing which
Mackenzie hated. Knutsford met him in the
ante-room.
“ I say, you’re not going to interview the Old
Man in those clothes, are you ? ” gasped the kindly
secretary in dismay. “He hates slops, you
know.”
“They’re all I’ve got; fl2o per annum
doesn’t run to tailor-mades when you’ve a mother
who is mostly invalid to look after.”
“That’s true enough. And you’d better
explain that to Mack—that is, if he gives you a
chance,” said Knutsford, vanishing into the
manager’s room.
“ Young Bolton is outside, sir. He’s wearing
slops—says he can’t afford anything else ; hasn’t
a decent suit in the world. His mother’s mostly
an invalid.” 1
“ Bring the cow in ! ” snorted the manager,
working himself into a proper state of fury.
Bolton came in looking the picture of despair.
His hollow, sallow face, his weary, colorless eyes,
his cheap linen frayed at the edges, were all noted
by the manager, who sat back in his chair and
frowned at him for fully three minutes without
speaking. Bolton stood on a gorgeous and im-
perial rug, holding his battered hat of soft felt under
his arm, and staring nervously at the manager s
beautifully-shod foot. The Old Man’s weird
scrutiny was disconcerting, and at last Bolton
began to tremble visibly. Altogether, he pre-
sented a most deplorable sight.
“ You young scoundrel ! ” hissed the manager,
at last.
Bolton showed every sign of collapse. He
seemed to have difficulty in breathing. He fur-
tively raised his eyes to the manager’s face,
dropped them again and clutched at the desk for
support, and leaned against it shivering like a
man suddenly stricken with ague. The Old Man’s
excursions into literature were limited, but be had
read “Vathek,”and tried for years to cultivate
the terrible look of the Caliph. Bolton was the
first one it had succeeded on, and the Old Man
loved him for it.
“What have you to say for yourself?” de-
manded Mackenzie, grimly.
Bolton was about to reply, when the Old Man
emitted a sudden roar.
“ Don’t you dare to try and justify yourself, or
I’ll have you arrested where you stand—you
despicable-looking object.”
Bolton dropped his hat on the floor. He shook
his head helplessly, and his jaw fell down. He
seemed on the verge of idiocy. Knutsford
writhed on his chair. This baiting of the unfor-
tunate wretch disgusted him.
“ Look at this object—look at him !” snorted
Mackenzie.
Knutsford swung round and stared at the trem-
bling wretch clinging to the desk, and then swung
his chair back to its normal position.
The manager felt satisfied with himself. He
leaned back in his chair and lit a cigar. It was
getting near the time of his departure for the club,
and he was feeling good.
“ You know, Bolton, a man has to be very
smart nowadays to embezzle. You aren’t smart a
bit. You’re too good a writer to be smart.
Never saw a copper-plate writer yet who had any
brains. You’ve got a good record as a reliable
worker. Everyone speaks well of you personally,
and declares you to be hard-working and con-
scientious. How did you come to make this
slip, eh ? ”
Bolton could hardly realise it was the same
man speaking. He looked round dazedly, and
then with an effort pulled himself together.
“ Well, the old lady’s been in bad health,
suffering a lot from rheumatism of late, and I
sent her more than I could afford. Got into
debt. People began to press me, threatening to
write to you, and I began dipping to keep them
quiet. Others heard that some had been paid
and came along threatening me, and I dipped
some more, and here I am.”
“ Up a tree—he-he, ho-ho ! ”
“ Yes, sir.”
“ Well, if I give you a chance, how
much can you pay back each month ? ”
“Ten shillings a week, sir—two pounds a
month, I mean ! ”
“ Ten devils a week,” said the manager vaguely.
“ Yes, sir ! ”
“No, you must pay back at the rate of per
week. I understand you’ve been sending the old
lady nearly £4 per month. Well, I’ll bring you
to town, and the money you paid for board at
Mongataranui will pay up the deficit. Mr.
Knutsford will fix up the details. You know you
might have got 18 months.”
ANTICIPATING THE USUAL SLUMP.
OLD GENT (to individual who has rescued his
hat): “ Thanks , my good fellow. I'm very
grateful to you.”
RESCUER : “I ’ope as how your gratitude won’t
diminish when we come to the question of
remuneration!”
The manager glanced at the clock, and, stop-
ping the flood of his benevolence, suddenly swore.
Knutsford jumped up, helped him on with his
fawn-colored Chesterfield, handed him his um-
brella and tall hat, and saluted. The manager
passed out, leaving a large cigar with a gaudy
band on his secretary’s desk.
“ You’ve pulled out better than I expected,”
said Knutsford when the manager’s footsteps died
away. “ The procedure is this : You will have to
borrow £3O and fix up the accounts you operated
on right away before the station-master finds out.
No one but ourselves must know anything of this.
Then you will give an order on your salary for £4
per month, and the thing will wipe itself out. As
soon as those deposit accounts are fixed up you
can come in here and live at home.”
“ But where on earth can I borrow £3° ** *
“ I’ll fix that up for you. We’ll go and get it
right away. Then yqp can come in to-morrow
evening. The sooner you’re with your mother
the cheaper it will be for you.”
The rest of that afternoon was like a dream to
Bolton. He remembered a small, richly-furnished
office, and a young, bright money-lender who had
nothing Hebraic about him ; he knew he had
signed a number of papers, after which there was
some whisky and a cigar. Then he found him-
self rolling back to Mongataranui with 30 pound-
notes pinned up in his inside coat pocket. It was
a dream.
• * * *
For 18 months Bolton worked quietly in the
Traffic Office. He was a beautiful penman, and
his cheerful readiness to undertake any extra
duties brought him into close contact with man-
ager, traffic clerk, and manager’s secretary.
They found him a really valuable man, and
Mackenzie never ceased to congratulate himself
upon having fixed up his trouble for him. From
the day he entered the office there was never a
mark against him.
Of late, he had exhibited a tendency to irrita-
bility ; but, as his holidays were long overdue,
that was quite understandable. He had also
opened up correspondence with men in the North
Island with a view to effecting an exchange with
some of them. But no one in the North Island
who was fit to be at large wanted to come south
to wet, windy Romahapa, the city of mud and
slush.
Later on, he tried to get Mackenzie to arrange
a transfer for him ; but, as he was a useful man,
Mackenzie did not display any energy in the
matter, and three months slipped by without
Bolton hearing anything. Bolton pressed the
matter, and the Old Man told him gruffly there
was no hope of a transfer.
Mackenzie sat in his chair with that particular
expression that is said to resemble the counten-
ance worn by a boiled owl. His collar was
crumpled, his cuffs were wrecks, and his sheeny
top-hat was a battered spectre of its former glory.
Fie had obviously had a wild night out. There
were beer-stains on his fancy cambric shirt-front,
and two out of the three buttons on his silk
waistcoat were missing. His mud-stained boots
reposed on his desk, and his dishevelled head was
resting on his left shoulder. He was talking
querulously to his secretary, who sat before a
table heaped with papers, taking no notice. Out-
side the door was a large card which warned the
staff that the manager was not to be disturbed
under any circumstances, and any communica-
tions were to be opened with the secretary per
telephone.
Suddenly the door flew open, and Bolton, wild-
eyed and angry, bounced in. Mackenzie half
rose with an oath. The secretary sprang to his
feet in anger and laid hands on the intruder. But
Bolton shook him off, and advanced to the
manager’s desk. The manager regarded him with
a dull fishy eye.
“Look here, sir, I’ve tried to get a transfer,
and you wouldn’t let me. Well, I’ve made up my
mind, sir. I’m damned if I’ll stand it—l’ll go
out of the adjective service before I’ll put up with
it any longer. I’d sooner be in gaol ”
The manager hiccoughed, and turning to
Knutsford, inquired more querulously than ever :
“What’s the matter with him? See what he
wants. Don’t let him bark at me like this. Con-
found it, don’t let him make a noise
—oh, my poor blanky head ! ”
‘ ‘ What the devil’s wrong
with you, Bolton ? Are you
off your mental balance, or
what ? ”
“Yes, mad as a hatter
—that infernal, horrible
old woman ! Ugh! I
won’t be her wayward son
any more. She’s coming
down to tell you. So I’m
telling you first, and I
don’t care what happens.”
“You mean your
mother ?”
“ Mother be . She’s
no mother of mine. When
I was stuck I rung her in,
gave her the last five quid I
stole to come down and do
the weepful. And when I
came here she insisted that
I should board with her.
I’ve done it—for two awful,
horrible years. Had to, or
she would have put me away.
Now, by heavens, she wants
me to marry her, and
threatens to expose me if I
don’t. But I’ll be damned
—let alone sacked —before I
do that; and this morning I
packed up. She’s outside
now, waiting to see the
manager to tell him all about
it. Now it’s out, and she
can come in and tell you.”
Manager Mackenzie sat up in his chair.
“You rung her in, you say? Well, I’ll be
d ! Why, damn it, you must have brains,
after all. Hie ! I’m proud of you. Man of
resource. No, you aren’t though, or you’d have
found a way of shunting her before this.”
Then Bolton flung himself out, and slammed
the door after him.
The manager looked at Knutsford, who wore a
pained expression.
“My look broke him up, though ! There was
no pretence about that, my boy,” he said proudly,
as he sank back into the chair. ‘ ‘ Get me a
brandy and soda, for pity’s sake. Then kick
that woman out of the office.”
“ She is kicked,” reported Knutsford five
minutes later.
“ She is kuk —hie,” repeated the manager,
unintelligibly.
C. A. JEFFRIES.


The Castaways.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SAM SHARP and his ancient and inseparable
chum, Jerry Maunder, both late of Mel-
bourne, leant in a negligent manner against
the same verandah-post in Barrack-street, Perth.
Sam sniffed noisily. Jerry’s lack-lustre eyes fol-
lowed the sinuous course of an inebriated but self-
satisfied individual, with a look of inordinate
longing.
“ It's a licker to me,” said Sam, readjusting his
tired person against the unsympathetic post and
digging his hands into his vacuous trouser-pockets;
“it’s a licker to me ’ow some blokes ’as alwis
brass enough to git boozed on. S'pose it’s jest
luck.”
Jerry, a man of few words, sighed heavily.
“ Honest poverty’s a thing I don’t ’old with,
no ’ow,” continued Mr. Sharp. “Stands to
reason it carn’t pay. Wot’s the good o’ bein’ pore
but honest, like the story-books says ? No, rich
but dishonest would suit my figger better. Why,
look at them American millionaire chaps wot one
sees in the paper. ’Ow about them ?”
Jerry breathed hard, and bestowed an amiably
senile leer on a white-frocked maiden who passed
with an armful of parcels.
“Wot’s the use o’ lookin’ fer a job ?” he said,
with husky irrelevance. “ You might jest as
well look fer a needle in a camel’s eye. ”
Jeremiah Maunder had been carefully brought
up in boyhood. A flotsam of badly-damaged
Scriptural phrases still occasionally swirled into
view among the dark eddies of his memory.
“Job ! ” scoffed the ribald Mr. Sharp. “ Why,
if you sor a job cornin’ straight up to you, ’at in
one hand and twenty golden suv’rins in t’other,
bli’me, you’d drop down dead with fright ! ”
“ PIo ! I should, should I ? Ho !” quoth the
indignant Jerry. “You’re so precious fond o’
work yourself, ain’t you, Sam Sharp?” and,
being unable to hit upon a more crushing re-
joinder, the matter was left in debate.
As the sun declined, the two men sauntered
slowly down towards the river. A score of snowy-
canvassed pleasure-boats shot hither and thither
athwart the broad bosom of the stream, their keen
prows casting up little fountains of spray as they
cut through the iridescent waters. Sam Sharp
viewed them with intense disfavor.
“ I wish I was a bloomin’ toff an’ owned a
yacht.”
He paused, then suddenly broke into a great
storm of laughter and smote his companion a re-
sounding blow between the shoulder-blades.
“ I've ’it it ! ” he cried, and tailed off into
cacophonous chucklings.
“ I know you ’ave—’ard, too,” complained the
aggrieved Jerry. “You jest keep your ’ands to
yourself, Sam Sharp, or me an’ you’ll ’ave words,
an’ so I tell you.”
“ It’s the safest scheme I ever struck,” pursued
the unheeding Sam. “ Not a atom of risk ; all
clear profit ! ”
“ Wot are you gassin’ about ? Carn’t you speak
out plain an’ sensible like me ? ” inquired the
now incensed Mr. Maunder.
“ Plain you alwis wos, Jerry, that I will give
you credit fer,” retorted the downright Mr.
A SYMPATHETIC BUSINESS.
THE UNDERTAKER IN THE HAT: “ Samuel , I
, ates to enter these pernicious 'otels, but the
landlord has an incurable disease , and a
man in our profession must be sympathetic. ”
Sharp. “As fer sense—Lor’bless you!” he
shrugged his shoulders.
“ Are you a-goin’ to answer of my question or
are you not? Yes or no ?” said Jerry from be-
twixt clenched teeth.
“Take a long breath, mate, an’ count ten, - ’
urged his comrade. “ Now are you aw’ right ? ”
Mr. Maunder gnashed his teeth.
“ Well,” resumed Sam, “ me an’ you’s goin’ to
ave a little game at bein’ castaways. ”
Jerry Maunder drew up his tall form, and his
white beard floated in the breeze. “Try agin,
Sam, an’ tork sense this time,” he said. &
Sam allowed the rebuke to pass unresented.
We are goin’ to be two shipwrecked mariners
wot ’ave bin driftin’ about the Hindian Ocean at
the mercy o’ the winds an’ waves ever since our
ship went down, an’ we wos the on’y two o’ the
crew wot escaped a watery grave. We shall
come ashore somewheres about Cottesloe Beach,
where the nobs live.”
“’Ere, Sam, wot’s the idea?” said Jerry,
eyeing his companion with some uneasiness.
“ You ain’t got a touch o’ the sun, 'ave you? ”
“ Of course they’ll send the ’at round fer two
pore sailormen wot ’ave lost everythink in the
world,” pursued Mr. Sharp, whose imagination
was working like yeast; “ an’ of course we’ll say
no, an’ refuse to take a farthin’! Ho, ves; of
course ! ” He bestowed a patronising wink'on the
astonished Mr. Maunder to indicate that his
words might be accepted as an example of fine
irony. “We oughter clear a tidy bit. You’ll
make a furst-class ancient mariner, Jerry, blow
me if you won’t. Sorter ’arf starved, dorg-biscuit
look about you wot’s worth a fort’n’.”
Mr. Maunder strove to compose his agi-
tated features into an expression of silent
and ineffable con-
tempt.
“ We orl know ’ow
clever you are, or
thinks yourself, Sam,”
he said, with cold
dignity. “Now
p’r’aps you’ll be kind
enough to explain ’ow
we are to work this
latest little novelty o’
yours ? ”
“ Certingly,” re-
plied Sam, with
cheerful acquiescence;
“ nothin’easier. You
remember that ’ere
coaster wat come
ashore last winter an’
broke up the very
next blow?” (Jerry
nodded briefly.)
“ Well, to - morrer
we’ll swag down to
the North Beach. At
night we’ll build our-
selves a raft - the
place is fair stiff with
wreckage—work out
a mile or so from the
shore, an’ run ’er ’igh
an’ dry at Cottesloe
the nex’ mornin’, jest
when the nobs come
down fer a splash
about.”
The rigidity of
Jerry’s features re-
laxed. He gave his
comrade an unwilling
glance of admiration.
“Wot a ’ead piece you’ve got, Sam; you
oughter ha’ bin one o’ them there writin’ chaps,”
he said. “You could invent a furst-rate story-
book, I reckon.”
Sam strove in vain to conceal his gratification.
“ Well, I s’pose that’s so,” he said, diffidently.
“ Y/hen every think else fails, I’ll try me ’and at
it. ”
Jerry pondered a moment.
“This 'ere Cottesloe’s where they ’ave the
promischievous bathin’, ain’t it ?” he asked.
Sam nodded, and thought impatiently.
“ Yes,” he said ; “ some o’ all sorts —male an’
female, kids an’ all.”
Jerry wagged his venerable beard. He had
been a modest man at one period of his chequered
existence. Shreds of the proprieties still hung in
rags about his inner consciousness.
“ I don’t ’arf cotton to it, Sam,” he remon-
strated. “It ain’t delicate fer the sects to make
too free-like. Couldn’t we come ashore some-
wheres else ? ”
“No,” said Sam, shortly; “we couldn’t, so
now you know it. You’re a nice un to be so
bloomin’ partic’lar—you are ! ”
“ I knows I am,” replied Jerry, shaking his
head sadly. “ I wos well brought up.”
“ I reckon the bringin’ up was waste of money
an’ good strap, ” retorted Sam. “ Now, ’ave you
any more objections to make ? ”
“ Yes,” said the other, firmly. “ Yes, I ’ave,
Sam Sharp. ’Ow are we a-goin’ to answer ques-
tions about a ship as we don’t know the name on,
an’ a capt’n an’ crew wot never existed ? There’s
a facer fer you. Instead of a pot o’ money, we
shall end by landin’ ourselves in jug. No, no,
Sam ; you’re cute enough at times, I own, but
this ’ere’s a bit over your weight.”
“Not it,” said the optimistic Sharp. “You
see, Jerry, we’ll ha’ bin three days without any
water, an’ no food but a. tin o’ rotten meat, same
bein’ from Chicago —wot the papers made the
startlin’ reservations about. Consequently we
took to drinkin’ salt water, an’, as a result of our
crool suff rin’s, we both lost our mem’ries —carn’t
remember no names or nothink ’cept we’ve bin
driftin’ fer days an’ days, an’ give up orl ’ope.
It's a sure soft thing, matey. Orl we’ve got ’er
do is to look silly an’ dazed-like—it’ll come
nat’ral to you, and I’ll ack up to it some’ow.
Then, d’reckly we git ashore, you’d better ’ave a
fit or convulsions, same as you used to ’ave in
Melbourne ; take a bit o’ soap in your pocket, if
you ain’t fergot wot it’s like. Everythink’s simple
as A B C.”
Jerry breathed hard and searched his mind in
vain for an insult of sufficient proportions to reply
with.
“ Now,” continued his companion, not giving
the aged one time to bring his cogitations to a
head ; “let’s choose the softest blade o’ grass fer
a piller, an’ ’ave a doss. We must be stirrin’
early to-morrer mornin’.”
■*■***■
Two days later was a Sunday, a fact carefully
calculated upon by Samuel Sharp ; and from an
early hour the beach at Cottesloe was thronged
with all sorts and conditions of humanity, revel-
ling in the bright sunshine and the keen salt air.
Presently someone descried a dark, shapeless
object which rose and fell with rhythmic precision
at no great distance from the shore. Whatever it
was, it awakened a vague feeling of disquietude
among the pleasure-seekers. A maiden in scant
bathing attire declared it was a shark, thereby
eliciting shrill feminine cries of alarm from her
companions in ddshabilld,. Soon the rumor ran
round that it was a raft fashioned of pieces of
wreckage, and that two men were clinging to it
and paddling feebly at intervals. Slowly it
drifted nearer and neared the eager, pushing
throngs. A man hastened in search of a boat.
Jerry squatted on the half-submerged raft, his
eyes fixed in stony despair on the ever-increasing
crowd assembled to give him and his companion
the welcome due to men snatched from the
ravenous jaws of death. Sam sat beside him, his
foxy face puckered into a network of lines of
mingled cunning and anxiety. He tried to
whistle unconcernedly, but no sound came from
between his dry lips. Pie coughed huskily.
“ Cheer oh, Jerry,” he said, half beneath his
breath. “ Couldn’t you manage a swaller or two
o’ salt water—they’re orl lookin’ at you.”
By way of answer Jerry gave vent to an extra-
ordinary choking gasp, and pulled distractedly at
his venerable beard.
“That’s your sort—keep it up,” whispered
Sam ; and, without a word of warning, he dipped
an empty meat-tin over the side and shot the con-
tents over his companion’s head. “ Orl for
apperience’s sake, matey,” he said, apologetically.
“ Kind-’earted seaman afraid as ’ow ’is old pal’s
got the sunstroke. Lord, Jerry, if you look like
that you’ll be the death o’ me ! ”
“You keep them tricks fer them as likes ’em,
Sam Sharp,” whispered the infuriated Mr. Maun-
der ; “or else 111 be the death o’ you in real
earnest one o’ these fine days.”
The frail craft neared the shore, and at last a
dozen volunteers rushed into the surf, and willing
arms hauled the vessel high and dry on the
shelving beach. Every man cheered until his
throat was sore. Every woman who was even
partially dressed either sobbed or fluttered a white
handkerchief. It was a scene calculated to thrill.
Sam was the first to stagger ashore —he did it
very well, considering. The fervor with which
he clasped hands with all and sundry was a revela-
tion even to the stolid Mr> Maunder.
“ Saved ! Saved ! ” he kept gasping ; then —
“ Water, mates ! Fer the love o’ ’Eaven, water ! ”
By this time Terry had been half-lifted, half-
dragged from the raft. Mindful of his obligations,
and deeming this a favorable opportunity for a
display of natural resource, he no sooner set foot
on terra fir?7ia than he collapsed limply, and
started scratching up the sand like a terrier intent
on bolting a rat.
“Pore chap!” said the sympathetic Sam.
“ Look at ’im. ’E’s worserer than me. Diggin’
fer water —that’s wot ’e’s arter.”
“How long is it since you lost your ship?
What was her name ? ” asked a little, inquisitive
man in a Panama hat and khaki trousers.
Sam shook his head. “It ain’t no good arskin’
of us,” he said sadly ; “fer it’s Gawd’s truth I
carn’t tell you, mate. We’ve both lost our
mem’ries. It may ha’ bin a week, it may ha’ bin a
month, we’ve bin afloat on that 'ere raft. Orl I
know is we finished our larst tin o’ meat three
days ago, an’ our larst drain o’ water the day
afore yesterday.”
A shiver of commiseration ran halfway round
the anxious throng, but the other half already
wore a look of suspicion. At that moment a man,
bearing a bucket of water, elbowed his way to the
front.
“ Stand aside there, carn’t you ? ” he cried ex-
citedly. “Give* them air, do ! Dyou want to
suffercate the pore fellers ?”
He raised the bucket to Sam’s lips, but that
self-denying castaway rejected it with a simple
dignity that was not without pathos. Pie pointed
to the prostrate Jerry.
“Tm furst,” he said. “’E’s a old man a-
totterin’ on the brink of ’is grave.” (Jerry started
violently.) “The larst drop o' water we’ad I
poured down ’is throat —’e were mad fer it ; ’e
said ’e’d cut me ’eart out to git at me blood.
Twice ’e tried to murder me in me sleep. It
weren’t ’is fault, mates ; ’is suff’rin’s ’ave drove
’im clean dotty.”
The crowd shrank away from the maligned Mr.
Maunder, who cast an indignant glance at his
comrade in distress.
“ Ere, ’old ’ard, Sam,” he remonstrated. “Not
so many o’ them false’oods o’ yours, if you please.”
Sam tapped his forehead significantly.
“ Told you so,” he said to the man at his
elbow; “quite lost’is mem’ry. Fine old chap,
too. Best cook I ever sailed along of. ”
“ Cook, did you say ? ’ inquired the inquisitive
little man, gloomily.
“Yes, cook,” replied Sam, anxiously, for the
little man had hardly been the same since the failure
of the castaways to supply the name of their ship.
‘ ‘ An’ ’is father was a cook—it sorter runs in the
fambly. Dear old’ man —me best pal. Every
night since we wos lost ’e torked to me about
’is pore old mother, ’er dear son’s on’y support.
Said ’e was sure as ’ow ’e’d be saved if on’y to be
a comfort to ’er in ’is old age. Thanks, mate.”
He accepted the proffered flask, and took a
long and hearty drink. Jerry, whose modest sips
had made no visible impression on the bucket of
water, looked at him, the green light of envy in
his eyes.
The little man walked round them both.
“ Poor fellow!” said a lady of uncertain years
to her neighbor. “ See how thirsty he is. I’m
sure he needed it far more than the old man.
How noble of him, too, to give up his share to his
friend when they hadn't another drop left. Quite
like Sir Philip What’s-his-name at the battle of
Thingumbob. ”
This was more than the justly-incensed Jerry
could bear.
“ My mate ain’t fond o’ water, mum,” he said,
with a facial contortion attributed by the on-
lookers to agony of mind and body. “’E’s like
me ; ’e prefers whisky when ’e kin git it.”
“ Shut your fat ’ead, you blamed fool ! ” mut-
tered Sam, in a savage stage-aside.
“ Give the other man a drink of water, and
then bring them up to the hotel while I go for a
doctor,” said an authoritative voice on the out-
skirts of the crowd. It was the publican who
spoke. Sam’s face, which had brightened at the
word hotel, lengthened considerably at mention
of a physician.
lf We don’t want no doctor,” he said. “ Doc-
tors is orl bloomin’ swabs.” He flattered himself
the condemnatory phrase smacked of the sea.
“Orl bloomin’swabs,” echoed Mr. Maunder,
still glowering on his co-partner in suffering.
At that moment, a big, burly, red-faced man
pushed his way forward. He beamed with
offensive effusiveness on the two stranded cast-
aways. He could have passed for a policeman
out of uniform.
“ Dash my buttons ! ” he cried, with affected
heartiness. “If it ain’t slim Sam Sharp and old
Jerry Maunder ! Why, where 'ave you bin all these
years—juggin' it ? I seed you both in Barrack-
street arternoon afore last, when I wos torkin’ to
Ikey Cohen. By the time I’d done with ’im
you’d scooted. Bin out crabbin’, I s’pose. Why,
wot’s up with old Jerry—got one of’is patent
misfits cornin’ on agin ?”
Sam went deadly white and breathed like a
man spent with hard running. He recovered
himself by a great effort, and laughed a harsh,
discordant laugh.
“ Damn you, Bill Smithers ! You’ve spoilt the
whole darned show, ” he said ; and, making for
the weakest section of the ring, he broke into a
mad sprint for the friendly shelter of the scrub.
Mr. Maunder was left to the tender mercies of.
the populace.

The Stocking.
In the old days the wrapping- paper used by shop-
men was so scarce that customers were expected to bring
their own paper and bags with them. Did a lady chance
to come without, she would pull off her stocking and
have the tea inserted in the foot. If sugar was required
as well, a string was tied round above the tea, and the
sugar inserted, and so on.—Daily paper.
RICH and rare were the hose she wore,
As for paper or bag never stopping,
She hurried away to Maloney's store
To do the weekly shopping.
The shopman was dreadfully modest and young
And susceptible, so you see
He lost his head and the use of his tongue
When she asked for a pound of tea.
He fumbled about for ten minutes on end
Till she feared he would never be through with
it,
And stammered at last: “ Plere’s our choicest
blend,
But bub-blest if I know what to do with it.
“ Paper or bags, we don’t keep ’em, you know,
Or else I could fix it in grand shape ;
If yer takes it like this it will scatter and blow
And bust itself over the landscape.”
Said she, “ Is that all that is troubling you ? ”
And the youth felt his universe rocking,
For having got rid of a number three shoe,
She proceeded to peel off a stocking.
She tugged at the toe, and she hauled at the heel,
And the swain’s hectic flush became chronic
As her little pink toes appeared en dishabille
(Though her motive was purely platonic).
“ Put the tea in the toe and the sugar on top,
And I wish you would be a bit smarter ” ;
Then he felt his heart flutter and suddenly stop
As she gave him her stocking and garter.
“ I won’t have my husband go hungry to bed,
Not for all the red gold that the State owes ;
So please add margarine and a loaf of new bread,
And fill up the rest with potatoes.”
In a dungeon, secured with a padlock and chain,
Foams a man whose appearance is shocking.
With a bloodshot expression he chants this refrain
As he fondles a faded silk stocking.
“ I’m to mind and be sure put the tea in the toe,
For safe and secure there it will be.
You’ll wear the same raiment, O happy Pekoe,
That encases her little pink trilby.
“ Her husband — her husband —is hungry—an oaf,
Some Caliban ruffian with splay toes —
I’m to add margarine and a four quartern loaf,
And top off the lot with potatoes.”

Comrades!
DO the shearers still go riding up the Warrego
to work,
Where the Thurulgoona woolshed flashes
silver in the sun ?
Are the bullock-teams still bending through the
coolibahs to Bourke ?
Is there racing at Enngonia ? Is Belalie still a
run ?
Do the Diamantina cattle still come down by
Barringun ?
Is the black soil just as sticky ? Is the mulga
just as dense ?
Are the boys still rounding cattle on the red Mul-
kitty plains ?
Are there still some brumbies' running on the
Maranoa fence ?
Still some horsemen always ready with more gal-
lantry than brains
To race them through the thickest scrub with
loose and flapping reins ?
Does the flood-wrack still go rocking round the
barren box-tree bends ?
Do scorching winds still steal the grass that means
dear life to you ?
Do you still receive the message that a ravished
Border sends
Of “ Water done all down the road, and starved
stock coming through ” ?
Does Drought still ride by liungerford and
Death by the Paroo ?
Heigh-ho ! But those were battle days, and
hungry days, and hard ;
With carcases and bones picked bare at every
turning met,
Lean steers upon the cattle-camps, lean horses in
the yard,
And weariness and bitterness, and toil and dust
and sweat !
Good luck to you, brave comrades, who are
battling with them yet 1

Dionysus.
I SAW Lord Dionysus on his car
Of gold and ivory ;
His face was paler than a waning star,
And on his thyrsus he
Was leaning heavily.
Was this the rosy god I knew of old,
Whose brow of white was bound
With vine-leaves green, and purple grapes and
gold—
Who drove, a victor crowned,
The young Greek world around ?
Alas ! Alas ! No more in Samothrace,
Nor by the Pontic shore,
Glad folk shall see the glory of his face,
As in the days of yore—
That glory is no more.
Lord Dionysus drove, with gaze that burned
Into the future dread ;
The vine-wreaths into serpents green had turned
With eyes of ruby-red :
They coiled around his head.
The Daughter of the Grape with dancing feet
Goes down the Primrose Wav ;
But O, ye wise green snakes and leopards fleet,
Ye know who for her gay
Mad masquerade must pay.
Lord Dionysus stood upon his car
Of gold and ivory ;
His face was paler than a waning star,
And on his thyrsus he
Leaned yet more heavily,
Evoe ! O Evoe ! someone cried,
As from a far-off shore
The lean, lithe chariot-leopards, yellow-eyed,
Paused on their pathway sore,
And answered wfith a roar.
And then I saw the maenads with wild eyes
And long black floating hair,
The vine and ivy round their breasts and thighs,
And pale as ghosts they were,
With wine-stained bosoms bare.
Evoe ! O Evoe ! rang aloud,
And, from dim lair and den,
Rushed saints with satyr-faces, and a crowd
Of hoofed and horned men,
Who raised the cry again.
The wanton women with their breasts of gold,
And shoulders round and fair,
Had eyes like nuns who in a trance behold
The Curer of all care,
The god with shining hair.
And haggard men, from lonesome hill and plain,
Took up the cry and song,
And cripples rising from their beds of pain
Went pantingly along
With that great panting throng.
And then, methought, the chariot of gold,
That was so fair to see,
Vanished, and Dionysus, bent and old,
With Cross for thyrsus free,
Passed on to Calvary.

Mutabile Semper.
THERE are fancies five wherewith I strive,
Whenever I think to wed—
I, who have never known aught of love,
But have bought my kisses instead.
I want a mother for sons o’ mine ;
A maid for flirting only ;
A comrade frank, a sweetheart shy,
A girl for the twilight lonely.
Though one hold sway for an hour or two,
Pier rivals four depose her ;
Chameleon-like my fancies change,
And I’m wondering why I chose her.
For there’s one to cuddle a baby boy,
And one to pace the pleasaunce ;
A mate in toil, and a dreamland queen,
And a girl with a laughing presence.
For there’s one to sit by the fire o’ nights,
And one to spend the day with ;
One to honor, and one to love,
And one to go to the play wit]:.
So I still shall strive with fancies five,
The star of hope o’erhead—
I, who have never known aught of love,
But have bought my kisses instead.

Rose-Surrounded.
IF you knew him, sleek and pallid,
You astounded
Would be at his week-end musing,
Rose surrounded.
He’s a clerk in someone’s warehouse,
And in quittance
For the green world he surrenders
Takes a pittance.
He’s a pebble on a sea-beach
Worn by weather—
One among ten thousand pebbles
Thrown together.
One would think—to see him working
Staid and solemn—
Life meant only figures marshalled
In a column.
One would think that moons autumnal,
Mornings vernal,
Lleld no rapture like the pages
Of his journal.
One would think his blood was faded—
Rendered duller—
By the ink that stains its crimson,
Spoils its color.
But behold him in his garden
When work closes
At the week-end, and about him
Cluster roses.
Then his fancy takes a rifle,
And goes faring
Down the wavs of old adventure—
Forest-daring,
Tawny lions roar defiance,
Gun at shoulder
He makes meat of them, and onward
Journeys bolder.
Thickets, marshes, rocks oppose him.
Here a river,
Sown with saurian monsters, gives him
Not a shiver.
Beasts of prey and arm-thick serpents
Strive to stny him ;
Swinging, red-limbed, down the forest,
Apes waylay him.
Then a leaf falls, and he starts as
One who dozes—
Finds himself in his own garden
With the roses.
Sometimes, when the mood is on him.
He goes wending
Down the world-way, making empires,
Despots bending.
By his Halidom ! (at moments
Greatly swearing)
He takes tyrants by the throttle —
Rashly daring.
Thus are Right and Truth established,
Wrong confounded,
By a dreamer in his garden,
Rose surrounded.

Old Rakaia Rolling to the Sea.
THE trams go humming far below
A-down the narrow street.
As through a gorge they seem to flow ;
Like far-off waters, faint and slow,
They make a music sweet.
They take me back where rivers run
From grim old glaciers to the sun.
The lisp of waters falling,
The drip of cascades o’er the ledges,
Swamps a-sighing in the sedges,
Across the years are calling !
How it tears the heart from me !
For my soul goes back to mingle
With the music of the shingle
Of Old Rakaia rolling to the sea !
Though I have seen the Buller go
League-long without a break,
Pent in his groove of granite low,
Sleek in his green and silky flow,
An undulating snake ;
With just one ripple standing still
Where some old boulder flouts his will,
Through shadowed purple gorges,
Above a snag with rapture slurring,
Over fords of gravel purring,
Swift to the sea he forges.
But his strength means nought to me ;
For my heart the flat is haunting
Where the gorse its gold is flaunting
On old Rakaia swirling to the sea.
I’ve known the Wanganui wend
His way past sandy beach,
Till through a rapid round the bend
He ruffles, laughing, to descend
And loiter in a reach.
Where down to lakes of amethyst,
Falling in filmy silver mist,
Slim waterfalls cascading
Upon the bluffs’ swart, time-scarred faces
Scarves of white and fairy laces
Eternally are braiding!
But it’s oh, again to be
On the river-flats unending
With the tot-tod bending
On old Rakaia dreaming to the sea !
And I have seen the Avon stray
In listlessness serene,
All through the smoke-hazed, dreamy day,
Loitering the quiet hours away
In avenues of green.
And I have heard her drowsy hymn
Between her grassy banks a-brim,
While over her, beseeching,
The willows droop their wistful tresses,
Like a dead lover’s last caresses
Out of his Heaven reaching.
But her peace is not for me ;
’Tis the plain’s wide spaces mellow,
And their miles of tussocks yellow,
Where Old Rakaia searches out the sea.
And deep within the dusty street
My river calls to me.
Across my world of stagnant heat
His waters make their music sweet,
And I again am free !
Where, cold and quiet as his snows,
Lordly, impassive, on he goes
Through mile-wide paths of gravel,
In slow and regal splendor winding. . . .
But how far the track, and, finding,
Long the years to travel
Back to that dim memory !
’Tis but the tram-car’s swinging,
And not the shingle singing
To Old Rakaia, rolling to the sea !

Child Song.
RONA in the springtime plucked the snowy
flowers,
Made a crown to crown her queen be-
neath the rata tree,
When there came a pattering of feet like August
showers,
And a pretty music-song of “ Follow, follow me.”
Rona with the snowy blooms in her golden
tresses,
Heard the little people, and she followed all the
day.
“Oh, and what will mother say if she only guesses
How the pretty fairies came and whispered me
away ? ”
Down among the feather fern, down among the
mosses,
Up again across the stream, and by the river’s
brim,
Where the saucy toi-toi all her soft hair tosses
At the laughing water-bubble after kissing him.
On the music wandered, all through the dark and
brightness,
And Rona tried to catch it where the fuchsia
berries grew,
Sure she saw the glimmer of a little bonnet’s
whiteness,
And in among the branches a little skirt of blue.
Down among the glossy green, beside the brooklet
singing,
Over mossy boulders, and past the big white pine,
Once, she came so near them, she heard their
armlets ringing,
And she saw the pretty jewels on their fairy
fingers fine.
All the day she followed them, and when the
stars came peeping
She saw their lamp-lights moving about in merry
play.
“Oh, and what will mother say when all the
house is sleeping,
And she knows the pretty fairies have taken me
away ? ”
Down the soft brown shadow way, and up the
moonbeam tripping,
Across the bridge of morning, far and far from
mother’s knee,
Stepping on the clouds and stars with never fear
of slipping,
She heard the pretty music-song of “ Follow,
follow me.”

The Song of What Do You Think.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OTHIS is the song of the What-Do-You-
Think, and it’s sung from a safe
“ retreat,”
And the copy was written in bilious ink to the
rhythm of pacing feet.
O this is the song of the Old Green Pen, and the
Tea-Cup revolution ;
Of the Stolen Ideas of Other Men, and it’s sung
from an Institution—
A legalised institution,
A sort of an Anti-club-pub-and-shanty-avadrink
Institution.
O this is the song of Advanced Ideas, and the
song of the Latest Fad,
Of the ’Osophys and the ’Losophys—the phees of
the Crazy Mad.
They grip the tail of the Thing that is Dead, and
believe they will save the Nation,
For they think they are flying far ahead on the
wings of a revelation.
(We have all had a revelation),
And they think they are flying o’er centuries
dying on the wings of a revelation.
Oh, this is a song of Boy Author Clubs, and their
old-maid Presidents
(And it isn’t a lay of the low-down pubs, nor a
trill for the navvies’ tents) ;
'Tis a song of the Greenery Yallery Schools, and
Culchaw in all its glory,
Of the Diddle-dee, Daddle-dee, Scratch-me-Back
fools and Physiological Story !
Oh, the Physiological Story !
The hemale and shemale, sash-wearing old female
and daring young neW-girly story.
Of Debates on “Free Love” in the Realms
(above), and readings from exercise books
On the Things that are Hid and the Woman-
Wot-Did —likewise of the Man Wot Looks ;
Of the things that are known to the spooks and
the gnomes, and the Ers and the Ists and
Isms,
And the Creatures that writhe in Maternity
Homes and the Catmittee’s catechisms—
Oh, those awful catechisms !
But Fred Brown, the prophet, shall picture in
Tophet the end of those ghoul catechisms.
Oh, this is the song of the Tea-room and Lawn,
where the slang of the Nicest is heard,
Where, “OBothah” in favor of “Dam” is with-
drawm, which they think an original word.
Where the grammar and slang of the Donah is
spoke, by a sort of a flank retrogression,
And the splutter, worn out and despised by the
Bloke, is considered a novel expression—
Is thought quite a smart expression ;
And the gushing young woman says “ filthy ” for
“common,” and for ought that might cause
her depression.
O, this is the song of the “ Push ” that has gone,
and of Dear Lady Who’s-This to come ;
Of Our Work with the Poor (by the Paid carried
on) —and of dear Mrs. Upstart’s At Home.
And Sir Hyphen and—Oh !—that Tariff You
Know; and that What’s This? —Freetrade
and Protection.
We are voting for—Who’s-This—Papa told us
• so ; but I’m sick of the silly election.
Then they “fluff” in another direction.
And I hope, when all’s ended, and broken and
mended, that I’ll fluff in another direction.
But this is the song of the Who’ll Get In, and the
song of the Who’ll Go Out —
And as to their votes, when they know who’ll w'in,
they haven’t the slightest doubt.
O this is the trill of the What D'you Think, and
the croon of the What Would You say ;
And they take it all down in their mental ink to
use as their own next day.
She’s so awfully clever next day,
And her cackle and capers are all in the papers
with owlish, approval next day.
They wheedle to cackle and pump to spout, and
they read, on the cheap, to write :
All day they are rooting the Libraries out, for the
“lecture ” they’re giving to-night ;
For the Meetings they hold, and the Papers they
read —the Committee-Room cackle they
cackle,
The League-Room Debates, and, in fact and
indeed, there’s no subject that they wouldn't
tackle.
(They’re a difficult subject to tackle)
It’s a plucky male-human w'ho’ll tackle a woman,
and some take a hero to tackle.
So this is the song of the coax to clack, and a
song of the pump to spout,
Of the climbing on men wfflo have brains and a
pen, by impostors entirely without.
Of the Ask Him and Know, Get It Out Of Him
So —or whatever you like to style ’uni.
Of the Who ? and the What ? and the Whether
Or Not—and it’s writ in a drink asylum.
(They call it a drink asylum)
And I say in this chanty, the damned Dilettanti
drive men to a drunks’ asylum.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“By the Pavilion of Mars—l fear nothing but
danger."
IT is hard to lose one’s girl, one’s friend, a
lordly pleasure-house, and much fruit all at
one fell sweep. These several misfortunes
had happened to Peter, and his whole existence
was swathed in gloom. Plis girl had cast him off,
and fruit was the base coinage for which she had
sold her affections.
Snowy Tomkins—who would have suspected so
white a head of treachery?—had brought large
quantities of fruit to Aunt Johnson’s back fence.
It w r as Peter’s custom at that time to spend
nearly every afternoon, in company with Jo,
hanging about Aunt Johnson’s premises—-the at-
traction being two small girls.
Snowy’s intrusion into this select circle had
been entirely unsolicited, but he had come one
afternoon bearing a huge bag of bananas, and so
he had been tolerated as an appendage to the
fruit.
If Snowy’s attentions had been limited to
bananas, all might yet have been well, but when
his passion rose to pineapples Peter’s importance
began to dwindle.
Where Snowy procured all this fruit was a
question that would concern the Rev. Tomkins
when the greengrocer sent his bill in. At present
there seemed no limit to the supply, and Peter,
after one futile effort to regain popularity with
unripe apples from the parental garden, was
forced to accept the ignominy of defeat.
The importance of life had been so long con-
cerned with Aunt Johnson’s premises that it took
Peter some time to adjust himself to his own
back yard again.
He was like a business man shut off suddenly
from his office. On afternoons he brooded on
the back gate, getting what consolation he could
from slices of bread and jam. True, the plums
in the garden w'ere ripening, and Bill had shown
upon the horizon again.
One afternoon, in conversation with Bill, Peter
gave out that he considered Jo a bit of a skite.
Bill supported Peter’s judgment by several in-
stances. They became very friendly, and Peter
graciously introduced plums into the discussion.
They talked of Jo and Snowy, of how they
were skites, and how Peter, had he wished, could
fight Snowy one hand tied behind him.
Peter found this sort of talk so soothing that he
carried the subject into his dreams. He fought
Peter muttered ferociously , but continued to sidle.
Snowy all about the township, and Dolly was
understood to sue humbly for Peter’s forgiveness,
which was steadfastly refused, Peter preferring
to gallop away for ever, dressed as a circus rider,
and always before an admiring multitude.
Pleased wfith himself, Peter went to school next
day and insinuated a little of this mental bravery
into Ponkey Wilson’s ear, with a most undesirable
result. Ponkey took the matter up in a thoroughly
public-spirited manner. At playtime he bellowed
it from one end of the ground to the other, and
before the bell rang it w'as an accepted fact that
Peter Dickson intended to fight Snowy Tomkins
after school that very day.
Peter was aghast. He made frenzied efforts to
stem the tide by alleging certain infirmities. He
had a cold, he had a sore knee; singularly
enough, too, he had to be home immediately after
school. He made at least that statement good
by bolting for home the moment he was let out.
It seemed better, also, to spend that afternoon
lurking in the diggings, and to slink home over
back yards and fences.
Next day was unpropitious from the start. His
life-like impersonation of one suffering great pain
at the breakfast-table was a failure. There was
nothing the matter with him, his mother said,
and consequently he would go to school.
Peter did not press the matter ; he melted
away into the stable and up into the loft. There
was nobody in the yard, and the groom lent his
august countenance to the scheme.
But Peter’s mortal enemy, the cook, came into
the loft looking for eggs.
Peter urgently required privacy just then, and
he might reasonably have expected to find it
under a load of hay. It was no part of his
scheme that a meddling old woman should tread
on him and fall instantly from the loft into a feed-
box.
Peter's explanation that he was also looking for
eggs was too thin altogether. Certainly, it w'as
unwise of him to shout at his mother in the hopes
of carrying conviction. He got a clip over the
ear that sent him out at the gate in a dancing
fury ; and before he had time to recollect what he
was doing, he w’ent to school. They gave him
one cut for being late and two for having no
home-lessons, and he was like to burst with rage
at the injustice of Fate.
Under these successive misfortunes Peter en-
tirely forgot he had a fight on his hands; but
Ponkey was there, and anxious to remind him.
“After school,” he whispered hoarsely, placing
one fist symbolically to his eye and agitating the
other about Peter’s head. Peter stared.
“Up the diggins’,” continued the hoarse whis-
per. There was more masonic gesture, and Peter
was enlightened. He paled visibly.
“Y’better give him the coward’s blow play-
time,” said the ministering voice presently. Peter
pretended not to hear.
“Knock the stuffin’ outer him,” continued the
voice encouragingly. “ Dinner time,” it said, as
one reminding. “Punch him fair in the”
Whack, came the cane, and Ponkey’s
attention w r as successfully distracted for
the moment. But he was so persistent
during the morning in his efforts to settle
the matter that Fate —with a wink at Peter
—had him kept in half an hour after school.
However, Peter had an anxious time before he
reached home. There was a crowd waiting for
him at the school gate, and their desire was to
know when “ the fight was cornin’ off.”
A boy known as Brownboxer, because of his
hat, who had already identified himself as a
prominent supporter of Snowy Tomkins, was
especially obnoxious in his inquiries.
“ D’yer funk it ? ” was his howl.
“ D’yer funk it?” yelled the crowd.
Peter backed sullenly till he struck the fence,
down which he began to sidle, the crowd going
with him.
“He funks it,” they shouted, commencing to
push Peter about a little on the strength of it.
Peter muttered ferociously, but continued to
sidle, upon w'hich Brownboxer became very
active. He pranced about Peter like an ungainly
fowl.
“D’yer take the coward’s blow?” he yelled.
“ No,” shouted Peter, with sudden and re-
markable ferocity.
The crowd instantly became silent, and Browm-
boxer ceased prancing.
“Well, when do yer fight him?” he asked,
more mildly. Peter commenced muttering
and sidling again, and the crowd livened up at
once. In this style Peter eventually reached
home —Brownboxer demanding, the mob de-
nouncing, and Peter muttering and sidling, but
peremptorily refusing to accept the coward’s blow.
He spent that afternoon in the diggings. There
was peace there, and security, and pleasant holes
to dwell in. He selected a suitable one and made
up his mind to live there for ever. He would
never go home, nor to school, nor up the town-
ship, nor anywhere again. He would simply live
in that hole and have a splendid time. In fact,
he was so busy fixing it up as a suitable dwelling
for a lifelong sojourn that he forgot all about the
time and was late for tea.
He had another dreadfully narrow escape from
Ponkey that very evening. A deputation, headed by
that indefatigable lad, came to the back gate and
whistled persuasively. Peter ran out briskly, and
climbed the gate, and repented his rashness the
moment he discovered Ponkey’s conical felt hat
among his visitors. Ponkey broached the matter
at once.
“ Snowy Tomkins ’s waitin’ for yer up the
Oval,” he said, importantly. “ Hurry up, or
yer’ll be too late.”
“What’s he waitin’ for?” gulped Peter, in
feverish anxiety to gain time.
“To fight yer,” said the deputation with one
voice. Peter trembled violently.
“ I ain’t let out to-night,” he said feebly.
“ Clear out,” suggested Ponkey at once.
Peter looked desperately round for some one to
stop him ere it was too late ; but not even the
groom was in sight. He set to work manufactur-
ing excuses.
It was too dark. This was promptly negatived
by Ponkey. Another member of the deputation
noted that the moon would be out that night.
“There’ll be tons offightin’ light,” they told
Peter reassuringly.
“ I—l—l ain’t got me hat,” said the craven, in
a last desperate bid for safety.
“ You don’t want no hat,” roared Ponkey, en-
raged at such unnecessary delay. He entered the
yard and tried to drag Peter off the gate. There
was a frantic scuffle, and Peter was just on the
point of betraying his contemptible cowardice
when a window went up and his mother looked
out.
She only looked out and w'ent away again ; but
the deputation, without waiting to discover her
intentions, bolted off down the flat in a body,
and Peter ran gratefully inside.
It w r as anxious work for Peter, those days. Pie
dodged up back lanes and wagged it in the dig-
gings, and at night sat close in the bosom of his
family. Rumors from the outer world were very
disquieting. Snow’y was described as exhibiting
t'he utmost bravery in public. It was reported
that he had openly avowed an intention to ‘ ‘ knock
the skite outer Peter ” at the earliest opportunity,
and Peter saw him go past once like a feudal
baron, trailing a long line of sycophantic re-
tainers.
But they got Peter at last. He was messing
about one afternoon with an old tin dish under
the bridge, when Ponkey descended on him like
a bird of prey. He fell over the embankment,
and his books dropped in the creek, and an
avalanche of boys, with Brownboxer at their
head, hurried over the edge.
“ When d’yer fight him—to-night?” shouted
Brownboxer, scrambling to his feet and engaging
Peter’s attention wuth a peremptory finger.
“Not to-night,” said Peter agitatedly.
“ Well, when ?” demanded Brownboxer.
Peter stood in the creek with the water squel-
ching out of his boots, and pretended to consider.
“ I ain’t goin’ to fight him,” he said at length,
“I’m goin’ to wrestle him.”
Brownboxer and Co. made a mighty fuss over
this unexpected decision. It was unanimously
rejected, especially by Brownboxer.
“Wrestle him, wrestle him, stinkin’-skitin’
rot,” he roared. “ Y’ve got to fight him, or will
yer take the coward’s blow.”
“ Or will yer take the coward's blow ?” chanted
the rest of the company in chorus.
“ Or else yer funk it,” added Ponkey severely.
“ Do I funk it?” said Peter, scowling darkly,
“ I'd fight him any day I like if I wuz only on.”
“All right,” said Brownboxer promptly, “I’ll
tell him y’ll fight him any day he likes to-morrer.’
At this decision there was a burst of enthusiasm.
Exultant hands assisted Peter out of the creek.
Soothing hands bore him up the embankment.
Flattering hands patted him industriously. Peter
was astonished. He had really intended to wag it
from school to-morrow, but the more they patted
him, the braver he got.
“ I’ll knock the skite outer that young Tom-
kins,” he said, looking round for approval. It
was promptly forthcoming.
“ I’ll learn him to give me the coward's blow',
continued Peter, working up the effect. “ I’ll
“ They're waitin' fer yer this very minute ,"
said Ponkey.
punch him fair in the nose ’s soon s look at
him.”
Unfortunately all this bravery barely lasted till
tea time, and left Peter a subdued and very dismal
small boy.
He wandered into the dark part of the passage,
and the outcome of a period of agitated thought
was a furious attack on the overcoats.
“ That’ll learn yer to give me the coward’s
blow,” he told the overcoats, and retired to the
dining-room, where he was presently involved
with a sofa cushion till his mother put a peremp-
tory veto on the proceedings. So Peter drifted
back to the passage again, whence presently came
industrious sounds as of one beating on carpets.
It warmed him up a little, but depression set in
at bedtime, and Peter was forced to fight Snowy
Tomkins for an hour or so before he could get to
sleep.
Pie went to school next day in a mixed state of
bravado and apprehension. He had intended
overnight to wag it ; but matters had reached such
a Stage that he was afraid to stay away.
However, he was glad when he got there.
Snowy Tomkins was absent, so Peter had a very
enjoyable time, getting his back patted by Ponkey
and his mob, who took him round carefully in
their midst after the manner of a dangerous young
lion.
Jo was not in this business at all. Peter and
he were widely separated now. Their interests
went different roads, for it is no true friendship
that has vitally important affairs in the privacy of
strange back yards.
Peter ran off to school quite cheerfully in the
afternoon, but got a damper the moment he
entered the playground. There was a white head
standing in the centre of a mob, and on a hasty
observation Peter could see that the mob was pat-
ting it’s owner’s back. He preferred to lurk in
school till lessons began, and he could have dis-
pensed with Ponkey’s tactless exultation, and his
reminders of “Wot price after ”
It was understood that the fight would take
place “up the diggin's after school,” and Peter
was on oath to attend. Striking his breath, and
swearing by all his gods, he protested he would
be there ; but when school was over he cadged a
job filling the ink-wells, and lingered over it till
all sounds died away in the playground. He took
a careful survey from a window before he judged
it safe to venture forth, and sneaked out at the
other door. There was nobody in the porch, and
there was nobody in the yard ; but there was
somebody waiting behind a tree-guard, as Peter
presently discovered.
“ They’re waitin’ for yer up the diggin’s,”
ejaculated Ponkey, pouncing on him exultantly.
Peter’s heart fell down into his boots, and he
turned pale. This was obviously his Waterloo.
“ What price ter-morrer ? ” he faltered.
“ They’re waitin’ fer yer this very minit,” said
Ponkey, astonished at Peter’s dull appreciation of
the delectable situation ; ‘ ‘ Snowy an’ Pidgeon ’n
Brownboxer ’n Bullocky ’n Billy Denny ’n the
whole push. We better run or else they’ll think
w r e ain’t cornin’.”
Tugging Stinker out of the ring.
“ They can bloomin’ well wait,” shouted Peter,
goaded into a sudden fury. “I ain’t goin’ to
chase all over the bloomin’ diggin’s to bloomin’
well please them or ennybody.”
“ Yes, yer bloomin’ well will, yer see,” shouted
Ponkey, enraged at this unnecessary delay.
“ Ye’ll bloomin’ well have to do it ; if ye don’t,
ye will ” —he roared all in a breath. So righteous
was his indignation at Peter’s base ingratitude for
all his struggles to bring the affair to a successful
conclusion that Peter succumbed to it.
“ Yer'll dam well have ter carry me books,
then,” he said, scowling. Ponkey was only too
willing. Rather than miss the entertainment he
would have carried Peter there on his back. In


his feverish anxiety to begin the festival he
would also have had Peter gallop all the way, but
Peter cantankerously refused to oblige him.
He insisted on stopping and spitting with great
deliberation into all holes, and roused Ponkey to
an almost ungovernable fit of fury by climbing a
tall tree to look for an alleged hawk’s nest.
As they neared the scene of action, joyous
shouts and hats (excitement in small boys always
runs to hats) arose from behind a big white
mullock heap, and Ponkey hurried his principal
up the slope, where his appearance was greeted
with yells of approval and renewed activity among
the hats.
Ponkey immediately commenced stage-manag-
ing with great energy. He charged down on the
company, and began pushing the small kids about
with a sort of indefinite activity, as though some-
thing had to be done, and he might as well do that
as anything else.
Brownboxer hurried out of a group in which
Snowy’s white head was the centre of interest,
and confronted Ponkey.
“’S youse’s blokes ready?” he demanded,
pointing.
“ Any day,” said Ponkey, readily.
“ Well, why ain’t his coat off of him ? ” asked
Brownboxer peremptorily.
Ponkey hurried back and pushed his way into
the crowd round Peter.
“ Yer better take yer coat off yer,” he said,
putting Peter’s cap in his pocket. With a surly grace
Peter allowed them to prepare him for the fight.
Everybody who could get a hand on him assisted,
and the boy who got his coat instantly put it on
over his own, and seemed to get considerable
satisfaction out of wearing it. Then they all set
to work patting him, and Ponkey selected a couple
of pebbles at random and thrust them into Peter’s
mouth.
“ So’s yer won’t lose yer breff,” he said. Peter
testily spat them out again and wiped his mouth,
but was too depressed to otherwise resent the
attention.
“My oaf, his muscle’s pretty hard,” said
Stinker Plummer, feeling Peter’s arm admiringly.
Ponkey immediately pounced on the arm. “Let’s
have a feel,” he said. “ Leggo, Stinker-inker-
plummer-bummer ! ’’ He handled the arm im-
portantly, as a doctor might a patient’s pulse, and
felt his own, with an air of vacant satisfaction.
Immediately after he sprang on Stinker Plummer,
and bore him to the earth.
“ Wot yer doin’ ?” he yelled, “ lyin’ his braces
round him like that for ? ”
The braces were adjusted, and Stinker rose
from the ground and eyed him bitterly.
“ Yer must reckon you’re old King Muck ” he
said at length.
“Yer breff stinks,” remarked Ponkey briefly,
and so did away with the pariah)
; Brownboxer was now seen working with great
agility in the centre of the Tomkins faction. He
sprang rapidly about, making terrific offers at
Snowy’s person with his fists, and after each
demonstration he was patted by the bystanders
with evident approval. Ponkey watched the
scene intently a moment, and bellowed at the top
of his voice ;
“ Are y’ ready?”
“Any day,” shouted Brownboxer, ceasing his
activity and grabbing Snowy by the arm.
The two factions moved towards a common
centre, amidst a tremendous uproar. Some of the
smaller lads, indeed, got so delirious with excite-
ment that they ran straight out across the diggings
and then bolted back again* in a perfectly de-
mented manner.
“ Clear the ring,” shouted Ponkey, pushing
the crowd about with utter recklessness, while
Brownboxer bustled officiously round in a circle,
without producing the slightest effect.
“Here, Ponkey Wilson,” he said indignantly.
“ You make your crowd clear out, y’ see.”
Ponkey at once plunged on Stinker Plummer,
and performed a kicking and plunging act with
him till they both fell heavily. Brownboxer
hurried to Ponkey’s assistance, and they worked
over the prostrate Stinker like a pair of soldier
ants, tugging him energetically some distance out
of the ring, and then hurrying back to take charge
again.
Stinker gave a frantic exhibition of rage in the
background, muttering and gathering rocks, but
nobody took the slightest notice of him, so he
presently dropped it and joined the crowd unob-
trusively.
Meanwhile the seconds worked like a pair of
beavers, pushing the crowd about and beseeching
that a ring be cleared.
By Homeric labor, and the simple expedient of
stamping on toes, about four square yards of turf
were secured, and the principals pushed into it
by all hands.
“Now then,” said Ponkey, breathing hard
after his exertions; “our bloke’s ready. Line
up, Brownboxer.”
Peter and Snowy were sooted at each other.
“We’re ready,” said the valiant Brownboxer,
ensconcing himself behind Snowy. The next
moment he rushed at a small fat boy and seized
him by the neck.
“ Outer the ring, Pudden Robinson,” he yelled.
Pudden had been forced into the ring by undue
pressure behind, and he stated the fact loudly, but
Brownboxer would listen to no excuses. “It
would learn him,” he said, stamping on Pudden’s
toes with an exceptionally heavy size in boots.
The frantic Pudden fought his way out, and let
ihe heavens hear of this injustice.
“ Yer old man stole Murphy’s fowls,” he yelled.
“ Tt's a noted fact yer old man's always drunk ”
Then, with biting malice, he bellowed across the
heads of the company : “ Yer hav’t’ wear that
hat.”
Brownboxer was evidently stung by the taunt.
Pudden might insult his father with impunity, but
not his hat.
“ I’ll lay for you, Puddenguts,” he roared,
menacing furiously over the heads of the crowd.
‘ ‘ D’yer funk it ? ” shouted Ponkey, recalling
Brownboxer to a sense of his position.
“Funk it!” remarked Brownboxer, con-
temptuously. “Do yer one hand, kneelin’ ”
Then he ostentatiously took Snowy aside, and,
shading his mouth with his hands, spoke these
significant words : “ The kidney punch.”
Peter and Snowy had been completely in the
background during all these prepara-
tions. Indeed, a casual observer
would have thought that not they,
but Ponkey and Brownboxer, were
about to fight. They were thrust for-
ward now in the sight of all, and
shaped up, full of apprehension.
Slowly they circled round, menacing
each other, with deprecating gestures
and nervous grins. Five times they
circled slowly thus, and then, in defer-
ence to indignant protests from the
company, they commenced to prance a
little. Their inclination, it is true, was
to prance as much backwards as possible,
but it was the seconds’ business to incline the
plane of battle to a common centre immediately.
Both boys were obviously funking on the
job, and Ponkey and Brownboxer wrought on
them like a pair of active demons.
Peter and Snowy began to lose their heads.
They were pushed and pulled and handled and
sooled at each other till, amidst frantic excite-
ment, they grappled and rolled instantly on the
ground, in a kicking, grunting, punching eruption
of legs and arms. They had shed all scruples
now. In about three minutes they were covered
with dust and consumed with hatred. On the
ground they fought, for no sooner were they
assisted up than they grappled, fell, and ham-
mered each other in the dust again.
Ponkey was in heaven. He capered about the
combat with voice and elbows upraised in praise
and thankfulness.
“ Never touched him ” was his howl as he
assisted Peter up for the twentieth time. “He
on’y tripped.”
“Tripped on his elbow,” screamed Brown-
boxer in scorn. “We’ve got you nearly beat.”
“ Hoo, you ; yer bloke’s got a bung eye.”
“ You—your bloke’s cockin’ his tail.”
“ Look at his eye! ”
“ Look at his nose ! ”
“Fight yer blin’folded one ’and kneelin’,”
bellowed Ponkey
“Fight yer one finger lyin’ on me back,”
shouted Brownboxer.
The customary etiquette for seconds, of course,
demanded this badinage. It was in no way to be
considered personal, and certainly it had a stimu-
lating effect on Peter and Snowy. “Yer got
him beat,” they were confidently assured, and
grappled determinedly for many rounds under the
delusion that each man was about to betray the
craven signal of defeat.
But gradually their enthusiasm slackened, and
they grappled with less sincerity.
There were longer pauses between rounds, and
the seconds had much ado to keep the affair suc-
cessfully going.
“ I tell yer he’s beat,” hissed Ponkey, as Peter
showed a decided reluctance to begin. “ Y’ve
blooded his nose for him.”
Peter was the more damaged of the two. He
had a black eye, and one shirt-sleeve tom out by
the roots, but he brightened up as a thin stream
of blood became visible on Snowy's dusty coun-
tenance.
“I've got him beat, eh?” he said, blinking
exultantly at Ponkey.
“ We’ve got yer beat,” screamed Ponkey.
Brownboxer answered defiantly, but jt could be
easily seen that there was a hitch in the Tomkins
corner. They were all trying to push Snowy
forward, and Snowy, was obviously reluctant to
oblige them. Ponkey at once hurried over and
thrust a few boys out of the way, while Peter was
led up by a prancing and plunging band of
supporters.
“Will he fight?” demanded Ponkey. The
question was passed on to Snowy, but he only
muttered and pawed at the ground with his heels.
Ponkey proceeded to adjudicate on the matter.
Would Snowy take the coward’s blow ? No;
Snowy would not take the coward’s blow. Well —
would he fight ? More pawing and muttering.
Well— he would take the coward’s “No ! ”
in a roar from Snowy. There was a great hub-
bub and shouting, and at length the case became
clear. Snowy would not fight, nor would he
take the coward’s blow.
“Aw! Give him the coward’s blow,” said
Ponkey, indignantly.
Peter hesitated and blinked doubtfully at the
company out of his undamaged eye. He was
still a little misty in his mind as to who had really
won, and he had a misgiving that' a punch on the
nose might start Snowy into action again.
“Go on,” said the mob, encouragingly.
“ Give him the coward’s blow.”
Peter lifted his fist and, after an impressive
pause, applied the blow of shame gingerly to
Snowy’s ribs.
Snowy backed away hurriedly, scowling at
Peter’s feet.
“ You hit me”—he kept muttering—“you hit
me again—then ye’ll see ”
“ Give him another,” yelled the mob, de-
lighted at the spectacle.
Peter gave him another. Evidently things
were going all right now. He did a hop, skip
and jump, and punched Snowy on the nose.
At this, in some mysterious way, Snowy’s
manhood completely deserted him. Without any
warning, he stopped muttering and let out a dis-
mal howl.
The company looked on astounded. Snowy
had fought well —better than Peter, in fact. And
now he wept—bellowed, with tears hopping off
his grimy countenance into the dust.
Ponkey, especially, was much amazed.
“ Hoot him ! ” he said at length, doubtfully.
“ Hoot him ! ” said a few of the mob, following
Ponkey’s example. Snowy wept, if anything a
trifle louder. He did not attempt to go away—
or explain himself. He simply stood there, with
his shoulders hunched up, and his mouth wide
open, and bellowed before all the world.
The hooting went on. Then one festive small
boy rubbed a handful of white chalk over Snowy’s
face. Then another jumped on his back, and in
a moment they were all swarming round him like
a nest of bull ants.
This handling had a remarkable effect on
Snow'y. There was certainly no counting on
his actions according to precedent. He stood
it for a while, and then suddenly changed
his anguished bellow for one of berserk rage. In
a second he was snatching up rocks and pelting
aw’ay like a madman, amidst a frantic scatter.
The mob ran all ways, Peter with them, and a
blind justice allowed Brownboxer to get hit in
the neck by a stone. From a safe distance they
stood and let the madman exhaust his fury on the
mullock heaps. In the afternoon sun he pelted
and pranced—and his berserk humor departed
as suddenly as it had come.
They saw him put on his coat, thrust his collar
into his pocket, resume his anguished howl, and
go off across the diggings in a demented manner,
sometimes walking, sometimes running, and
occasionally stopping to peer into holes. They
let him go. There w 7 as no wisdom in venturing
too near a boy subject to such lightning-change
emotions as Snowy.
Everybody went off with Peter instead. Popular
feeling was on his side entirely—he had won.

Waltz Song.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE old dance-hall stands lonely where a
dozen cart-tracks meet,
Green paddocks billowing down behind,
and sapling-shade each side
This house of joy, from which, o’ nights gone by,
the noise of feet
Came out to where dim couples kissed, and
where gaunt nqgs were tied
Along the post-an’-rail. This is the hall where
Elsie danced
Her soles to rags, nor caused the dew of toil to
damp my brow,
Although all night she waltzed with me, and
swung around, entranced,
Ten lovely stone of her—and she’s a fifteen-
stoner now !
Ten stone she was—a featherweight when the
band began to play,
When she took the track in a dreamy waltz,
and trailed her skirts along
With her eyes half-closed, like a fairy maid with
a fair-size waist, away
Like thistledown on a western plain when the
breeze from Bourke is strong.
Fair Elsie was an angel then, a heap of years ago,
With feet as light as a breath of wind—it’s a
matter for mention how
These times she’s a dreamy waltzing girl when-
ever she gets a show ;
And at supper-time she’s a marvel. . . . She’s a
fifteen-stoner now !
Through all those lovely nights we danced to loud,
alluring strains
Of wind-bag and of fiddle—or sat out, behind
the hay
(In those gay dancing days we had more energy
than brains—
At least, I think so now !), and afterwards I’d
get the shay
And drive her home (yes, now and then with
Ma !) from the festive hall,
And crawl to toil in time to milk the early
morning cow.
But I’ve given all these frivols best, and I never
dance at all,
And Elsie ? Well, she’s Missus Smith, and a
fifteen-stoner now !
VICTORIA.

’Loo.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’M doin’ a solid perish here in Brixton on me
ovrn ;
The English winter’s beat me an’ I’m goin’
crook a treat;
For things are only middlin’ when its freezin’ ter
the bone
An’ I’m longin’ for the sunlight an’ the heat.
Me heart is chill an’ snow-bound, an' the fog is
in me brain,
As I dream about the places that I knew ;
So I’m waiting for the ship that’s going to take
me back again—
Take me back again to Boshterville—that’s 'Loo.
’Loo, ’Loo ; take me back to 'Loo
Where the streets stand up on end an’ where the
sky is always blue ;
They say that Heaven’s worth
Every place there is on earth ;
But I’ll take a shade of odds it isn’t 'Loo.
The air has got a scum on, an’ it takes yer breath
away ;
The sun ter save yer life yer wouldn’t know—
As it peeps above the skyline for an hour or two
a day,
Like Some Chow’s lantern hanging dim and low.
It’s great at nights when all the lights along the
West End flare
And the girls make eyes and gaily call and coo ;
But the brilliance of the millions who parade in
Leicester Square
Ain’t half as fine a sight ter me as ’Loo.
’Loo, ’Loo ; fairy, leery ’Loo,
Where the Johns are game an’ willin’, an’ the
Toms are ditto too ;
Where yer see the ferry lights
Flitting through the summer nights
As they travel down the harbor, north o’ ’Loo.
Take me back ter where it’s easy ter get ninety in
the shade ;
Ter the beaches where a bloke can raise a tan ;
Where I’ll change this blasted death-mask that
the London fog has made
For a lace that makes yer feel that yer a man.
I want ter strike the boulders where yer got ter
watch yer feet ;
An’ hear the trams come singin’ “ Hoo-hoo-
hoo ! ”
As they’re plungin’ like a switchback down the
slope o’ William-street,
An’ they take the push from Watson’s . back ter
'Loo.
’Loo, ’Loo ; how I’m wantin’ you !
How I long ter meet the cobbers an’ the clinahs
that I knew !
How I long once more ter lurk
Round the two-up schools at work !
How I’m ragin', roarin’, ravenous for ’Loo !
I'll hump me swag ter Tilbury, an’, when the
mailboat goes,
She’ll take an extra stowaway —that’s me—
Who’ll wait ter smell the gumtrees just before
Fremantle shows
Like a string o’ di’monds stretched along the sea.
Me heart’ll throb in Adelaide ; round Collins-
street I'll roam ;
CAVE CAN EM.—(By an Impressionist).
I’ll be shicker jest wdth joy when we are through
The channel close be Pinchgut, an’ 1 11 feel that
Pm at home
As I finish up below the hills o’ ’Loo.
’Loo, ’Loo. Back once more in ’Loo ;
Me chest’ll measure forty, an’ I tell yer what I'll
do—-
I’ll go an’ say me prayers
At the foot o’ Butler’s Stairs,
The moment that I’m safely back in ’Loo.

MILTON MACGREGOR.
Arundel’s Return.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I DON’T think Bill was as frank and unre-
served as he might have been with me over
Arundel.
I barely knew he had a brother, and even when
he did mention him, he was obviously close about
it, and I could get no particulars. Not that I
wanted to know, but when a man asks you to
accompany him all the way from Australia to
the interior of Africa somewhere, while he looks
up a lost brother, you expect a little confidence
in return.
I heard enough about Arundel’s absence, and
how Bill was bothered about it, but why Arundel
was absent and kept absent, or what kind of a chap
he was, Bill always shied at, and of course I kept
oft it.
But I said, “Why don’t you write to him?
Why must you go all that long journey just because
you would like your brother to come home, and
he doesn’t want to? Do you think he'll come
home any more for that ? You can’t lug him
home, can you ? Perhaps he’s all right there !
Anyway, why don’t you write ? ”
“ I can’t write. There are no post offices
where he is ! ”
“ But you hear from your cousins sometimes,
don’t you ? ” For he had told me, when I was
bothering about it once, that Arundel was
stopping with some cousins.
“ Never ! They never write ! ”
“ But he could ! ”
“ They might not let him ! ”
“Where is it ? ”
“ Somewhere up towards the Zambesi.”
“ Good Lord ! ” I said, for I knew very well it
would end some day in me going there with him,
which it did.
We touched on Arundel now and then on
board the steamer.
“ What did he go out to Africa at all for? —
diamonds or ostrich-farming ? ”
“ No ! ”
“ Gold?”
“No ! Only because he wanted to ! ”
And then he got that tone in his voice that he
always got when he didn’t want to talk about
Arundel, and I said, “That's a fine sunset!”
thinking all the while that for tw r o bosom friends
like Bill and me, he might have been more chummy
about the business.
The vagueness of our destination complicated
matters a bit. When we came to it, as we had to
sooner or later, Bill not only didn’t know the
exact spot, or anything like it, that he wanted,
but was ignorant even of the names of the people
his brother was supposed to be with ! And this
was after weeks of travelling in a wilderness, and
when our horses were dead and we were reduced
to swagging it and shooting our own dinner.
I suggested that we should separate each morn-
ing, and hunt for Arundel’s house —which must
be the only one thereabouts—on parallel lines,
and make smoke signals to each other at intervals,
and meet at night. We would cover more ground
that w'ay. But Bill flatly declined, and we
plodded on together. Bill still said he was sure
we couldn’t be far from the place.
There was plenty to think about, and any
amount of big game if we wanted it; the trouble
sometimes was to avoid it. One day I almost
ran into an ugly rhinoceros, with a sharp horn
sticking up from its snout. Another day we came
across a colony of anthropoid apes. They were
quite cheeky, almost aggressive, and we thought
we’d have to shoot some in self-defence, but
they at last made off. Some of them were of a
great size, and I drew Bill’s attention to one that
was strangely human in its appearance—much more
sd than its fellows.
I was for shooting this specimen right off, for I
believed Professor Haeckel would have paid
(or it ; but Bill shoved in and danced around, say-
ing “No ! For God’s sake no!” and
knocked my rifle down. “Do you
want to bring the whole mob
down on us ! ”
I said we surely might take
something back out of the
country —if we didn’t get
Arundel, which looked likely,
we should at least have
some trifle for our trouble !
J We were in a part now
where we didn’t care to go to
sleep both at the same time,
so it was turn and turn about
at night, with one always to
watch.
I woke up that night w'ith
the mosquitoes, and noticed
that Bill was not about and
the fire had gone low. Putting
a stick or tw’o on the embers, I
waited for him to come back.
Pie would sometimes at night
go on little short quests after
Arundel, and I knew he wouldn’t
be long.
But presently I thought I heard
human voices some distance off.
Soon I was sure of it, so, grasping
my gun, I went off softly in the dark-
ness. I could soon distinguish Bill's
voice as if in argument with someone,
and then another man’s would answer
in negative tones. Of course I thought of
Bill’s brother, and I was not surprised
to hear Bill say, “ You must be mad, Arundel.
Give it best, and come back with me ! ”
“And how about work? You know I can’t
face that.”
“ Make another try, Arundel, for all our
sakes ! ”
“Not a bit of it ! I’ll live the life I chose
every time ! I get it here. It’s the simple life,
and I’m not going back to work, and that’s the
long and short of it ! Why should I change ?
There are no ties here, perfect freedom, and
plenty of good tucker when you get used to it !
What did you come around bothering for ?”
It was too dark to see anything, either of Bill
or the other.
“ But consider, Arundel ! ”
And then I began to think it was perhaps not
the thing for me to be there overhearing what the
brothers said. At the same time Bill seemed
to have made a fool of me all the time, and I was
a bit wild as well as curious. Just then the strange
voice said, “Of course, I’ve got to be careful,
vou know. If the big fellow saw through me he’d
break mv neck as soon as look at me. He takes
violent fits into his head, all in a moment some-
t j mes »
Who the “big fellow” could be, and how
Arundel could be comfortable near such a brute
passed my understanding, like everything else in
the business, but I left off my eavesdropping, and
went back to the fire.
SAVING HIS FACE.
“ Yer needn’t er been so thunderation smart. I was just going to get off , anyhow!"
Next morning I asked Bill how soon he ex-
pected to be in the country where his brother
was? He said he was going to give the search
up. He was sick of it. I answered that we
should go on for another 20 miles or so at least,
and inspect the country carefully for Arundel’s
house, because a brother was a brother, and we
could never promote Arundel’s return if we didn’t
hit on the spot where he was putting in his absence.
But Bill only looked weary, and said he wasn’t
going to search any more, and after arguing with
him a bit longer and saying that since we had
come all the w'ay to Africa we might make a job
of it now we were there, especially as he had got
me to come all the way too, I gave in to him and
we turned south again. Bill was very dejected as
we went along, and I really wondered whether it
wouldn’t be a kindness to tell him that I knew he
had found his brother, so that he could unburden
his mind by talking about it to someone. But just
then other things began to crop up.
We passed the big pack of apes again. Oh,
how they booed and gutturally roared, and baited
us, getting cheekier and nearer till I got scared !
They were beginning to hurl pieces of branches
at us, when Bill fired his rifle up in the air, and
that routed them.
And then a minute later, strangely enough,
I happened to look back at the retreating pack,
and I saw that very same human-looking monkey
that I nearly shot a day or two before. He was
perched on one of the trees and waving what
looked like a pocket-handkerchief to us, as if in a
sort of farewell !
“Look! Bill—he’s saying good-bye to us !
Well, I’m . Isn’t he like a man ? Did you
ever see anything like it ? ”
And I waved my arms frantically up and down
to him, and Bill did so too, and then the blessed
monkey did it. He seemed quite affectionate.
Bill waved his arms to the monkey even more
than I did, until I said at last, “ O come on !
that’s enough ! Anyone would think it was your
brother Arundel you were saying good-bye to. ”
Then Bill looked at me so queerly that I looked
at him, and then at the monkey, and then at him
again, and I said, “ Look here, Bill ! I believe
it is your brother ! ” And with that Bill caved
in and gave me the whole yarn.
“ I’m ashamed of him, Fred, and that’s the
truth, and that’s why I didn’t talk about him ;
but I’m sorry now that we came and that I
brought you on this wild-goose chase. To think
of a fellow brought up like he has been choosing
to live with a lot of creatures like that ! ”
“ Well but, man alive ! After all, how can he
be a brother of yours ? What are you giving
me ? ”
“ Oh, all that hair is only a skin he wears over
him somehow. He’s as smooth as you or I. A
handsome fellow, Arundel is, and with abilities,
too, if he wasn’t such a fool. To think of a man
like that wasting his opportunities so ! ”
“Excuse me, Bill,” I said, “but I suppose
misfortune can come to any of us, even if he is
your brother ! ” and I tapped my forehead.
“No, it’s not that! Waywardness ! Pure
wilfulness! He always was wilful, was Arundel .
“ O come, that’s more than mere wilfu ness. A
man that separates himself from is e ° w
that, and voluntarily lives among the brutes, is
not responsible for his actions. And look nere,
Bill if lie’s your brother, we will not eave im
there. He shall come back to civilisation w e
he wants to or not, for we’ll go back and capture
him, and take him away between us.”
But Bill shook his head.
“No good, no good ! He d only escape at the
first opportunity. You don t understand it at
all,” he went on again after a pause. Arundel
is doing it with his eyes wide open. He has
really found what he wants, or, rather, he has
lost what he does not want, and that is work.
So now the cat’s out of the bag, Fred, and per-
haps you’ll understand. He says he is happy,”
added Bill, brokenly, drawing his sleeve across
his face, “ and that it is our loss, and not his.”
•*«*■*
The gloom of the forest, as we made our way
silently through it, did not help to dispel Bill’s
melancholy. He went along with his eyes on the
ground, pondering on the loss the world had
suffered when Arundel fled to the higher branches
of the tree of life.
We were proceeding like that when, coming up
behind and shooting ahead of us came the figure
of a naked white man. He was running as I
never saw man run before, taking superhuman
strides, fleeing apparently from something behind
us. ■
“Arundel!” cried Bill, and we gave chase,
but we never got near him. We ran our
hardest after the fleet figure, shouting as
long as he was within hearing ; but we might
as well have tried to catch the high-stepping
lightning. “Arundel ! Arundel ! Stop !” cried
Bill, and I roared “Arundel ! you're working /”
But even that didn't stop him, and we gave it up.
I was glad, after that sprint, to sink down on a
log and breathe. And just then an ominous noise,
something like the sea makes, and coming up in the
distance behind us, made us both turn pale. It
was the increasing roar and chatter and threaten-
ing of apes innumerable.
We ran again—for our own lives now.
“ It’s the anthropoids ! ” said Bill. .“ They’ve
found him out, and are after him —seen him with
his skin off or something ! O Lord ! ’’—for just
then a stone hit Bill on the back of the head.
What saved him was the fact that his hat was far
back on his head at the time.
Some of the fleetest of the brutes had already
caught up to us, and ran alongside. I brained one
with the butt end of my rifle, but they were under-
sized things, and, until reinforced by the mob
behind, were not much to fear. Presently I looked
over my shoulder and saw one about three feet
across the chest, close on to us, and gettingover the
ground at a surprising rate. He had a peculiar
body swing, assisted by his front hands. I stopped
and took aim at his head, and shot him. Pie
dropped not above 20ft. away. But there seemed
to be a million of them not far behind, and we could
hear them breaking off bits of branches to attack
us with. Besides, lumps of earth and ugly pieces
of wood were falling round us. Bill got hit on
the neck again, and said, “O Lord!” Every
now and then we fired together to make more
noise, and shot some of the biggest of them.
This would scare the rest for a while, and so we
passed the time, half dead with fear and worn out
with fatigue. I said to Bill that it was a pity
Arundel had made them so cross, and he said,
“ But it was lucky he chose this way to run from
’em ! —they’d have had him for sure if we hadn’t
been between !”


As it was, they would have worn us out if they
had kept on much longer, but suddenly they
dropped off, and we could breathe easily again
and take stock. Bill’s neck was bleeding and I
was limping with a bash in the shin I’d got from
a hurled log, but principally we were dead beat.
I threw myself down on the grass thankfully, as
if it was the sweetest couch in the world. I felt
as if I never wanted to get up from it again.
Bill stood there looking a bit reproachful, I
thought, only I was too tired to notice, till he
said, “All right, you have a bit of a spell, and
I’ll go on.”
“ What ? ” I said.
“Yes, I’ll push on and see if Arundel’s all
right. I’m rather anxious about him.”
I knew it wouldn’t do to separate, so I got on
my feet again, though I remarked, grumbling-like,
“If your brother is going at the same rate as
when we saw him last, we’ll never catch up to
him—-he must be at Durban by this time. ”
“Yes,” said Bill, “but Arundel is just like
that. He bursts off into a thing full steam from
the start—has no idea of half measures, of com-
mencing easy and getting gradually stronger,
which is the' way to last. It would be better for
him in life if he had.”
“ O well, if starting easy means a good finish,”
said I, “we ought to end up strong enough on
the bit we’re doing now, for I don’t feel as if I
could make a mile in three hours.”
But I could see he was bothered about Arundel,
so I said no more—just nursed my leg and went on.
After an hour or so Bill, who had got some
distance ahead, looked back and lifted up his
hand with a “tread softly, this is hallowed
ground ” sort of air.
“ Arundel !” he whispered when I got up, and
there in the bushes was the young man asleep, his
head pillowed on his arm, looking the very picture
of well-fed and fatted enjoyment.
“ Handsome, isn’t he ?’’ said Bill. “ Don’t you
think there’s the makings of a grand man there ? ”
“Well, wake him up,” I said.
“Not for the world ! We don’t knoiv what
he’s been suffering Let him take his sleep, and
you take yours. I’ll watch.”
I went into my part of the programme straight
off. Sleep ! I was almost asleep before I lay
down. When I awoke, the two brothers were
talking. I don’t know whether Bill had had any
sleep or not.
“ Arundel has consented to come back to Mel-
bourne with' us, Fred ! ” he said joyfully.
• * * *
Well, we hadn’t been many days on the march
back before Arundel began to complain of his
feet. We were all footsore, and my leg was still
stiff, but Arundel’s anguish was colossal.
“You see, he’s not been used to this tramp,
tramp, tramp,” said his brother, feelingly, to me
on the quiet. And the morning after that, when I
got up, I found Bill hard at work making a kind
of litter.
“ What’s that for?” said I, and he winked at
me to be quiet before Arundel. Afterwards he
explained to me when Arundel was not by.
“ You see, Fred, I’d never forgive myself, now
we’ve got him so far, if anything happened to
put the boy off coming home, after all we’ve
been through for him. I don’t want to remind
him of anything like work, Fred—not till we have
him safe back. And he won’t be so very heavy,
not for two, and if he sits on this thing, we can put
all our things on it instead of carrying them, and
Arundel can mind them, and I can take the front
and you can take the back, like a good fellow,
and you'll see we’ll make better time really. I don’t
want to give him any excuses to go back to his old
life, Fred.”
I don’t think I made any reply. He poured it
all out so unexpectedly that by the time I’d sized up
the fact that W'e were to carry Arundel the rest of the
African way, Arundel himself had joined us, and
any remarks would have been out of taste. But I
thought Bill had a cheek. Arundel was a great
hulking fellow, nearly 6ft. high, and 30 if he was
a day—for all that Bill called him the. “ boy ! ”
No sooner had we got started again, too, than
Arundel sang out for padding, because he said we
jolted so, and we had to cut cushions of ferns and
grass to put under him.
Then we took our places in the shafts, Bill and
I, and went on again. Bill was contented enough
all the time, . because, as he would tell me of
nights sometimes, he always felt that Arundel was
safe there, between us two, and that the dream of
his life was to compass Arundel’s return to his
own people ; also that, but for my help, for which
he would ever be grateful, he could never have
done it.
“But there’s one thing!” he said, later on,
when we began to approach settled country,
“We’ll have to get some things on him ! The
idea of running him in naked among a lot of
civilised folk may turn his mind against it, and
then, Fred, we’d have all our work spoiled, after
all ! ”
“ Well!” I said, “ What the deuce can we do ?”
“ Well ! I’d like him to get into the settle-
ment, feeling as if he’d a right there —you know
what I mean—and not feeling odd among his
fellows. Of course, if we take him in there with-
out clothes on, and with things on ourselves, he’ll
feel out of it, won’t he? And perhaps he’ll wish
himself back in his old life again. But if we take our
things and patch him up respectable, we’ll know
it’s only a temporary inconvenience for us, and
won’t have any of those feelings, and not knowing
anybody here we won’t care, as long as we get
him in all right—don’t you see ? ”
See ! Of course I saw ! It was as plain as a
40ft.-high wall, and I commenced taking my
trousers off for Arundel at once, to save time.
“No !” says Bill. “I'll give him mine, but
your coat’s a good ’tin—he can have that, and I’ll
wear my coat round me legs.”
Of course, we had enough to keep us warm,
without any clothes, going along and carrying
Arundel, but poor Arundel himself, just sitting on
the litter doing nothing, was no doubt different,
and it got colder as we made our southing. Then
one day it was extra cold, and Arundel chattered
his teeth all the time, and at last, after many re-
proachful glances from Bill, I said, “ Hold on—
he can have the lot ? ”
Then Bill and I took off the rest of our things
and gave them to him, and took the shafts again
like two white Kaffirs, and that's how we entered
the-Transvaal, carrying Arundel back to WORK.

“ T X TOT narks me,” declared the naked
y V brown person, sprawling upon the
warm sand, “ wot narks me is that I
’ad a bonser job this time larst year. Now, look at
me! Hevery day—hevery—bleedin’—single day;
nix t’ do ’sep’ lie abart an’ tan me ’ide by the
briny hocean. Blarst the briny hocean ! —l’m
dead sick of it. Pleasant ? Grarnted ; but there
ain’t no money in it—funny ’ow all the things
yous like doin' there ain’t no money in. An’ I
ain’t one o’ these blokes wot won't bloomin’ well
work. Wot I’ve alwus said is a bloke oughter
graft if ’e kin git th’ kind ’f labor wot suits ’im.
Writin’ f’r the papers, keepin’ a pub, ’r a bobs-
room, ’r a merry-go-rarnd—any o’ them’s easy,
but yous ’ave to ’ave capital Pr the larst three, an’
the first ’as too many poor coves in it awready.
“This job I ’ad larst year? Gum!—what
rotten luck I ’ad ! I ’ad it off an’ on hever since
the plague come to Sydney. I caught rats Pr the
City Council. O’ course, it was on’y a winter job,
’cos the plague was on’y abart in the winter, an’
when the summer come the Council went crook
on keepin’ a lot o’ blokes in lugshury at a sprat a
scalp. Darn went the price to a thrum when the
larst case ’ad bin discharged. Some years, they
never even paid that. Then, by the winter, the rats
’ad bred good an’ thick agen, an’ there was
money in the game from the time they took the
first poor cove art to the Coast ’Orspital.
“ You knows ’ow some coves ’ate idlin’ ? I'm
like that, an’ it useter give me the fair ’ump to
’ave to come darn ’ere all the summer, when I
knoo there was still plenty o’ rats in the city. But
I ’ad me pride, an’ yous couldn't buy it Pr thrup-
pence a scalp. Some poor blighters kep’ on at
them starvation wages, sayin’ they ’ad a missus
an’ kids. Thank Gord, no woman’s ever ’ooked
me ! Not but wot some of ’em ’aven’t tried,
neither.
“ Now, one day, as I lay on me back wiv the
sun good an’ warm on me belly, I got a bonser
idea. I knoo a bloke wot worked in the Guv’-
ment Cold-Storage Deppo. Why shouldn't rats
keep just’s well in ice as ’ens ’r rabbits ’r heggs ?
Nex’ time I was in tarn I went hup to the Cold-
Storage place an’ arsks ’im.
“ ‘ Nark pokin’ it,’ ’e says.
“ ‘ Nix de poke, Larry,’ says I ; an’ before I
left ’im we ’ad the ’ole thing readied up. I got
at the rats agen, an’ put ’em in hegg-boxes, wiv a
layer of goo-goos on top to show the boss of the
place if ’e got curious. My cobber kep’ ’is heye
on ’em, an’ saw they didn't come to no ’arm. ’E
took io per cent, on the first case I took art as
soon’s the plague started agen. But the feel of
the brass in ’is palm set it ’itchin’, and the nex’
box I took away ’e come darn on me f r 20 per
cent. Simple bloodsuckin’, I calls it. I ’ad two
more boxes, an’, will yous believe it ?—'e made
me pay ’im ’arf before ’e’d ’and ’em hover, ’ Arf /
FASHIONABLE COPY.
JOURNALIST'S WIFE: “ What are you writing, dear?"
JOURNALIST: “Flounces for your new dress, my darling.”
I bucked, of course, but wot could Ido ? All ’e
'ad to do was to tell ’is boss that the heggs in my
boxes was bad—they was, too ; shop-uns at tup-
pence the dozen—an’ out the ’ole lot ’ud go in the
garbage-punts. An’ I couldn't put ’is pot on,
’cos the Council would ’ave ’eard of it from ’im by
the nex’ mail', an’ they mightn’t ’ave liked it.
“I paid ’im the ’arf, an’ waited for ’im one
hevenin’ as ’e were ploddin’ ’is ’omeward way,
an’ ’e plodded the rest of it wiv both of ’is heyes
blackenin’ nicely, an’ ’is nose in a sling, ’E
looked like the Face at the Winder when I’d
done wiv ’im. It was awmost worf the money.
’E talked abart lettin’ the Council know, but it
’ud ’ave, meant ’is own job, an’ I wasn’t frikened
of that.
“ Yous may ’ave noticed ’ow one idea leads to
hothers. As soon ’s I’d done up the refrigerator
bloke, I saw ’ow it was to go in future. No
pardners, neither ! I near got run in for righteous
be’aviour, I was so ’appy. Cold storage wasn’t a
patch on this. I made cages towards spring, an’
as soon as the Council started bearin’ the stock, I
started breed in’.

Coming in to get married.
“My oath ! —rats breed quick. Once every
three weeks, fr’m six to ten at a litter. Soon I
’ad all me lirrle bit of a yard filled wiv pens. The
young uns were fit to kill in less ’n a moon arter
they was born. But, if yous ’ll believe me, they
was so tame that I simply ’ated to put ’em out.
Business is business, ’owever, an’ when I thought
of the sprat each was worf, they bloomin’ well ’ad
to go. I kep’ the beggars just like the ’en-fanciers
keep their chooks—changin’ me stud-bucks hevery
now’n’ then until I’d himproved the size sufficient—
some of’em was as big as tom-cats —an’ cullin’ the

“ If there’s one thing I ’ates in the ’ole bloom-

’e ain’t wanted ! Me nex’ door neighbor moved,
an’ the noo bloke ’ad one o’ the lirrle blighters
which ’ad took prizes for rat-killin’ in Heng-
land, an' ’ad ’is porkrait in a lot o’ the hillus-
trated papers, along o’ the two ’undred odd rats
’e’d done up when ’e broke the Henglish record.
Soon as ’e got into the nex’ yard ’e started sniffin’
an’ yappin’ an’ scratchin’ at the fence, an’ the
bloke come out, affable-like, an’ tol’ me the dorg’s
pedigree, an’ ’ow there must be rats in my place,
an’ ’ow glad ’e’d be to fetch the dorg over one
day an’ show me ’ow smart ’e was at killin’ ’em.
“ I says I’d swear there wasn’t a rat in the
place ; but ’e smiles a pityin’ sort o’ smile an’
points to the tyke.
“‘Look at Jock,’ ’e says. ‘ Think 'e don’t
know ? Why, I never sor im go on so since we
’eld ’im hover the pit where ’e broke the Henglish
record.’
“If wishes was as fatal to forx-tarriers as
strychnine, Jock ’ud never ’ave broke no more
records. I stalled the bloke off, an’ ’e went in-
doors, a bit ’uffy.
“For three days an’nights the dorg whined
an’ yelped at the fence. Then, one night, ’e
thought it out, an’ started burrowin', an’ I come
out at dawn to find ’im polishin' off the last o’ my
brood does. The stud buck was lyin’ near, torn
in ’arf, an’ a pen o’ culls, wot was goin’ to market
in two days, was scattered all over the yard. I
picks up a palin’ an’ into ’im. ’E ’owls, an’ the
howner comes art an’ over the fence, wavin’ ’is
fists in me face.
“ ‘ ’Ands off! ’’e yells. ‘ That’s a prize dorg,
worf a ’undred an’ twenty ’
“ I belts the dorg agen, an’ the bloke fetches
me one on the snitch. The dorg gets ’old of me
leg as I fell over a pen of rats, an’’ then ’e lets go,
when the rats got out, to deal it out to them.
When I got up I didn’t waste no time, I promise
yous. I got all over the bloke, an’ grabbed the
dorg be the tail as ’e was bustin’ the door of
another cage, an’ threw ’im over the fence.
“‘All right!’ says the bloke, sittin’ on the
ground.
“ ‘lt's a pity yous ’aven’t
got a tail too,’ I says.
“‘All right,’ 5 e says
again, gettin’ up an’
limpin’ to the fence
an’ crawlin’ over.
‘ Just you wait. ”
“Ilaughed. ‘Yous
ain’t goin’ to call
your big brother ? ’
I says.
“’E bent hover
the dorg. ‘ ’ls leg’s
broke,’ ’e says, an’
give y’ my word ’e
started cryin’ like a
tart.
“ ‘ Pity it ain’t ’is
neck,’ I says, as ’e
took the dorg into the
’ouse.
“Blowed even then if I see wot I was in for.
I see it ’arf an hour later, when the cove comes to
my door wiv a John, an’ gives me in charge for
’arborin’ vermin to the danger of the public
’ealth. The John cocked ’is heye round the yard,
and warned me that anythink I said ’ud be used
agen me. ’E was a young, innocent John, an’
what I said seemed to shock ’im a bit. When me
case came on I tells the beak ow kids kep’ white
mice, an’ arsks why the ’ell I couldn’t keep
brown rats. But ’e says the cases are not on a
par—wotever that means—an’ sent me hup for a
moon in the jug. An’ when I come out I found
a letter fr’m the Council waitin’ f'r me, sayin’ as
’ow they was my obedient servants, an’ ’ow they
wasn't talcin’ no more rats from me. I wrote
back to ’em, tellin’ them I ’ad the honner to hin-
form ’em that I ’ad ’eard that the Lord Mayor
wanted my job, an’ that as I thought as 'ow the
billet ’ud soot "im, I wouldn’t stand in ’is way.
“ That’s’ow it ’appened. Cripes ! —there’s a
tarrier now. Watch me get on to ’im.” The
naked brown person picked up a round, water-
worn pebble and stole after the unsuspecting dog.
There was a howl of anguish and a flash of black
and white as some small spotted thing dashed
along the beach ; and, as I turned to leave, two
naked brown persons mixed it enthusiastically,
splashing in and out of the fringe of the surf as
the battle led them.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ILIKE to wander down the street whene’er my
work is done,
And speculate upon the way the Human
Race is run ;
I like to add and to subtract, to hazard and to
guess,
To analyse the people’s lives—.their joys and their
distress ;
To weigh them here, and balance there the ancient
and the new—
It's grand to be a noble bard, and all the streets
review !
That loudly-dressed old pirate there, who smokes
a fat cigar,
Is off to meet a lady fair in some secluded bar ;
Or yet, perhaps, for all I know, he's hasting down
the street
To chairmanise and sermonise where brother
churchmen meet !
That classic-featured fellow there —his calling well
I know ;
A cultured college lecturer —or else a bottle-oh !
And here’s a storyist and bard (I like his dreamy
eyes)—
Or else a Goth who scarcely knows the stars are
in the skies !
And there’s a mummer from tbe Cri. (I note his
waving hair)
Or else a Ilun who wears it so because it's cheap
to wear !
And there’s a hard-faced pugilist who haunts the
Gaietee —
Or maybe he’s a clergyman who prays for bards
like me !
That fluffed and painted damsel is a Darling of
Misrule —
An unrepentant Magdalene —or teaches Sunday-
school !
And there’s a good philanthropist, who’ll for your
needs arrange—
Or maybe he’s a usurer, or on the Stock Ex-
change !
And so I size and sum them up what time they
pass along —
The queer, unconscious folk of whom I chant a
pagan song.
I like to wander with the Crowd and guess its
joys and woes,
Its smallnesses and greatnesses- for I’m the chap
who knows !
I like to loiter here and there and watch each
passer-by,
To wonder who, and which, and how, and
w'hither, whence, and why.
But who am Ito judge mankind? Dear friends,
I’m what I am ;
A young and drifting optimist who doesn’t care a
damn !

Temptation
AN urchin, I was stood on end, and taught
That all the things I loved I didn’t ought;
For were they not the promptings of the Devil,
Whose sole concern was how I might be caught ?
And always such a human child was I,
I welcomed his suggestions on the sly.
Yea I looked ahead,"as sanguine kiddies will,
To the far rosy years of by-and-bye.
* Did I play alleys after school, and win,
the stern verdict—Marbles were a sin I
The tawse enforced the moral of the taw ;
Lo I how I yearned for cricket to come in I
7 the Devil tempted me. I took a bat,
Neglecting Sabbath-school, but found the fat
Was in the fire when I got home to tea :
How to explain my broken Sunday hat ?
So, black and blue, 1 learnt the lesson grim
The Sunday catechism and the hymn 1
And learnt, while poring question, answer, proof,
Patient to wait the years of freedom dinj.
Long years, and then ripe years with promise glad,
And here and there for chances to be bad
I sought. I left the pious choir, and then
Found how they had deceived a trusting lad.
I sat at cards—l never won a trick;
Danced, and my partners voted me a stick.
I rushed despairing to a bar, and there
Ordered a whisky— and it made me sick.
And often I was fain to see a play,
Yet rarely had the price there was to pay :
And when I had a bob, I always found
The play so bad I wished I’d stopped away.
i\ . .
Once, in my dreams, I often used to see
Some Venus rising from a dreamland sea,
And in my youthful innocence had feared—
Say, rather, hoped--I’d sometime tempted be.
Of all my boyish dreams that went aglee,
These dreams the craziest and wildest be.
Though Eve has tempted Man from Adam down,.
No Eves have ever dreamt of tempting me. ,/ / /
They glance at me, they laugh and turn aside ;
They seem to wish the pavement twice as wide,
For I’ve a mug that is a fantasy,
A nightmare that my whiskers cannot hide. |

’Tis not for me the wine of life to sip 1
Prom the rare chalice of a rose-red lip. '■
Oh ! for a weird, new, practicable sin,
Before this soul of mine gives me the pip l

LOST IN THE INTERIOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
]f[ E journeyed to a heathen isle
To help his reverend father ;
The natives welcomed him in style
With banqtiet — savage , rather !
But when the dish uncovered was
His appetite recoiled ;
He could not eat that meat because
He found it was Pa( r) boiled!
He saw again the stern old face,
He recognised the bunion,
Though served with peppercorn and mace,
And smothered up in onion.
His face became as tvhile as dough
And broke into a lather;
He felt that he was quite de trop —
His host was “ helping" father !
“ For years, ” remarked the chief, at last,
“ Our etiquette has reckoned
That, though we find the first repast,
Our guest provides the second.”
His neighbors ribs he gaily poked,
Then smiled upon his guest,
And smacked his lips, and gently stroked
That part below kis chest.
Around their prize all danced a reel
(For father ale like leather),
They had to find another meal,
And so—they CLUBBED together ?
That sable chief still rules his clan,
And oft his musings run
“He wasn't such a bad old man,
But what a tender son ! ”

The Sheep’s Skin.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE trees on the rises above the bay swayed
with the force of a keen sou’-wester, but
the bay beneath lay sheltered, excepting
when a gust of gale slapped the water. The
light from South Head threw its pale blue film
on the opposite shore. Now and again the
lighted ports of a coasting steamer passed up
the harbor, gliding calmly as if joyed to be out
of the turbulence along the coast. It is a peaceful
spot, this idyllic bay, lying in silence amid a
wild night. It seems deserted.
At last a rock spoke, a huge black boulder
with a ledge like a mouth at its lower point.
Its tones were sepulchral—hollow as if empty
bones spoke. This is what it said :
Cursed be him wot sleepest on a sheep-
skin.” r
Then all became silent again. Not a tree or a
rock spoke, yet the gums on the rise still swayed
their topmost boughs, anguished by the winter
gale. A wayward gust would come shrieking
down the gully and slap the face of the calm
water as if it would rend the bay asunder.
And then, again, the boulder spoke :
“ Twice cursed be him wot sleepest on a sheep-
skin.”
Then came a murmur from the still rocks and
sheltered bushes, and a second voice took up the
refrain.
“Er crimson curse be on the bloke’s ’ead wot
dosseth on a sheepskin.”
Then the chorus rang out from every rock and
bush.
Damnation seize on the cove wot sleeps on
er sheepskin.”
“ Ther Bible saith so,” completed the great
black boulder.
The narrow crevice above the first step of rock
gave sounds of restlessness, and then whined ;
“ W’y don’t yers leave me erlone. It’s mine,
ennyways. I copped it meself, and yers are on’y
envious ’cos I’ve got a comfortable doss, so yers
After an impressive pause the big black boulder
spoke:
“ It is written that a curse will befall ther man
wot sleeps on er sheepskin. ”
“ Well, I never see’d it written, en I don’t care
ennyways. It’s playin’ it low down ter come er
dodge like this on er bloke. I on’y ast ter be
left alone. I leave yous alone.”
“ Him wot is deaf to warnin’, let ’im be
cursed,” said the boulder.
’ it iu ther Bible then ?” asked the crevice.
“Twenty-third verse, ninety-seventh chapter
uv ther Book er Tobias. Eleventh command-
ment.”
“Well, I never heerd uv it.”
“ That’s ’cos yer don’t read yer Bible.”
WHEN YOU HAVE SECURED ALL THE LUXURIES OF LIFE IT IS A
TERRIBLE THING TO FIND THAT YOU HAVE LOST THE APPETITE.
“ I don’t believe it, ennyways. Yer might
leave me alone w’en yer knows I’ve been brought
up well, and want comfort. I don’t act ther nark
w’en yous blokes have somethin’ wot I haven’t.”
“Ther curse be on yer ’ead then. It’s not me
wot says so, but ther Bible.”
Then the night fell silent and time elapsed.
At last the crevice uttered :
“Even if ther Bible does say so, it might not
be true. Everythin’ wot’s in ther Bible isn't
true. Yer says so yerself. ”
“ But this is true, Willy. Yer knows I was
eddicated to be a Wesleyan parson, and I knows
wot’s meant to be true and wot’s fairy tales. Did
yer remember Ginger Mick, enny uv yers ? ”
“ ’E wuz before my time,” said the Port Tack-
son fig.
“ Me and him used to share a brick sepulchre
at ther old Devonshire-street cemetery. Ginger
’ad a sheepskin, and he uster say to me, ‘ Enny
time I get sloughed in on ther vag, Dinkie, yer
can use me sheepskin ; on’y keep it clean and
wholesome.’ En I slep’ on that sheepskin many
a three monce at er stretch.”
“ En did yer ’ave a curse come on yer ?” asked
the crevice.
“No. Yer see, it’s on’y ther man who owns
ther sheepskin wot cops ther curse. It were
Ginger wot copped out.”
“Wot ’appened ter him?” asked several in-
animate objects of nature.
“ Well, fust he gets bubonic ; and then he ’ad
a lift come down on ’im and break him all up ;
and after that he copped leprosy, playin’ fan-tan
in Goulburn-street.”
‘ ‘ En ’e died ? ’ ’
“No, dyin’ wuz too good fer a man who ’ad
slep’ on er sheepskin. ’E lived.”
The surroundings of the bay grew thoughtful,
and silence ensued.
“Where is ’e now?” asked the crevice, in
about ten minutes.
“ Workin’.”
This paralysed the crevice, and at last, after
much meditation, it moved, and something was
cast out of the little cavern. In an instant
boulders, trees and bushes gave birth to a dozen
leaping phantoms, and a wild,scuffle look place
over the thing which had been cast forth. There
was a tugging this way and that ; stones were
hurled into the thickest of the disturbance, and
the phantoms of the night yelled awful execra-
tions on the night air.
The spirit of the Port Jackson fig emerged
successful, and it leaped up the rocks to its
shelter, the gnomes of rock and ti-tree scrub in
active pursuit.
It w'as the voice of the great black boulder that
rose loudest in the dispute :
“ It wuz me wot did the guiver, and this fer
me pains. I’ll see yers in a blue fit before I lends
me brains to make a cop again. I'm sorry I
spoke now.”
“ Oh, you shut up, Dinkie, or I’ll roll a rock
on yer when yer gits ter sleep. Yer always
talkin’ er brains, but it’s muscle wot tells in this
yer bay. If yer tries ter come enny slime over me
wif yer brains, same as yer did wdf poor Willy
below there, I’ll break yer jore wif me fist. See
if I don’t. ”
In face of this, the shadows crept back to their
receptacles, and peace hovered over the bay again.
The cruel sou’-wester hurled its mighty force on
the gums on the rise, and now and again more
vicious gusts slashed at the waters below ; and at
last the Port Jackson fig called out :
“ Good night, Willy. It’s er nice sheepskin,
and I likes it; but don’t be alarmed erbout me
gettin’ a curse. Yer knows, yer owns it and I
sleeps on it.”

A Song of Ships.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHERE the Arctic fulmar flies—
Where the berg-heads beat the
skies,
And the sealer, steering nor'ward past the ice-
pack and the floe,
Sees the mystic Northern Lights
Streaming down the Polar nights—
There the ships of Man the Master on his errands
come and go!
Where the deep Sargasso drifts,
Where the tide-head sinks and lifts —
There his steamers fling their smoke-wreaths to
the scintillating stars ;
Slip their cables from the piers,
Driving down the salty years—
Beating forth around the planet under steam or
towering spars !
Dragging nations at their heel,
Floating waggons built of steel —
Hauling men and manufactures round the palpi-
tating earth j
See ! They shuttle to and fro—
For the Master wills it so,
And his orders feed the Peoples in their days of
bitter dearth !
Tra.7iip-sh.ips and battleships,
Wheat-tanks and cattleships —
Craft from all the Harb.or-mouths ’twixt Trond-
jh 'em and the Hoim ;
These the A/aster ordereth —
Cliff and cape he bordereth,
And he hangs his steam and cinders on the altars
of the Morn !
Timber-ships from Puget Sound,
Stately mailers Plymouth-bound—
Ships with wool and merchandise, and all that
Man hath made ;
Steaming south and west and north,
From the Bluff to Firth of Forth—
Bow down, ye silly draper-folk, and hail the gods
of Trade !
Yes, hail the engineers,
And the Master-hand that steers —
Hosanna to the Captains and the Builders and the
Crews ;
All hail unto the steel !
To the kelson and the keel,
And hail, ye mighty cylinders that drive the
roaring screws !
For the cross-head and the crank,
They are greater than the Bank—
Yea, greater far than emperor and king and
crown and queen,
And the man who shovels coal—
Fie is better, on the whole,
Than the pessimistic balladists who sing What-
Might-Have-Been !
Stevedoi-es and sailor, men,
Gi-easer-folk and whaler-men —
These, good Lord, go heftily, nor fret about their
souls !
These with steam and stw-diness,
Whilst parsons rage in woi-diness,
Go bach andforth incessantly betwixt their ocean-
goals !
Whilst the actors smirk and pose,
Swing the piston-rods and throws—
The screws in subtle harmony commune beneath
the sea ;
Yea, an under-song they sing
Of the goods they take and bring—
Of Men complete and masterful whose servants
strong they be !
Of the far Hoboken piers,
Of the swearing engineers—
Of all the careless sailor-men who take them out
and in ;
Lo, of these a song they chant—
Of the gull and cormorant,
And all the time exultantly they beat the seas and
spin !
From the jungled Sundarbans
To the bridge that Brooklyn spans—
All round the world from ’Video to flull or Hel-
singfors ,
Singing deep beneath the sea,
Can’t you hear them —singing free,
While the firemen swing their shovels at the
blazing furnace-doors !
Alercha/it-ships and fighting-ships,
Cable-ships and smiting-ships —
German ci-aft and Britishers, and all the world's
besides ;
These they sing, propelling them —
The song the sci'ews are telling them,
Round the world and back again upon the crooning
tides !
Have the Crozets seen them go,
Marching swiftly to and fro ?
Have the Cocos heard them beating through the
star-splashed tropic night ?
Have the seven Elder Seas
Nursed them fondly on their knees —
Nursed the ships that Man
hath fashioned featly
planned and fashioned
right ?
I/O, the Harbors know
them all,
Know the cargo-
tanks that call—
Each hath gripped them long
and lustily beside its tarry
piers ;
Had the world but
singing lips, .
It would chant of
steam and ships—
It would sing of craft and
captains, stoker-folk and
engineers !
Were the seas articu-
late,
Would they chaunt old
songs of hate ?
Nay, their songs were of the
Master and his ships of
hammered steel ;
Had the universe a
voice,
Would it sing a dirge
for choice ?
Nay, its song were of the
Builders who had mated,
shaft and keel !
VICTORIA,
Timber-ships and cattle-ships ,
Old wheat-ships and battleships —
These the singing Universe would celebrate at
morn!
And /, who love them lustily ,
Would weave an anthem trustify
For all the Ships and Sailor-folk 'twixt Trondjhem
and the Horn !

To the Town of Alcalar.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
01 The wide road, the grey road,
The road that stretches far
Into the mist that distance blends,
Into the haze that straightness lends,
Into the end of endless ends
And the town of Alcalar.
O ! Purring chain and humming wheel
And dust-dimmed handlebar !
Carry me swift o’er the level plain,
Ere night shall fall and the light shall wane
Carry me, carry me, back again
To the town of Alcalar.
Put back the years, the long grey years ;
Wipe out the things that are ;
The sunshine slants through the westward trees.
Soft from the south springs the cool night breeze.
O ! for a sight of the rolling seas
And the town of Alcalar.
Faint as a ghost in the sunset sky
Twinkles the evening star ;
By the shades of the deep blue night we’re chased,
And the twilight hour we dare not waste.
More speed ! More speed ! For we must haste
To the town of Alcalar.
Put back the years, the long, grey years ;
Wipe out the things that are !
Though night rush down on velvet wing,
Lights in the valley are glimmering ;
We can hear the vesper bell a-ring
In the town of Alcalar.
We have won the fight ’gainst the endlesss leagues;
We have come both fast and far :
But many a moflth and many a year
Have passed, and though I hope, I fear—
How fares the girl that I loved dear
In the town of Alcalar ?
Out in the west, like a flaming ball,
Blazes the evening star.
But my heart is gripped with a hand of lead ;
Tall candles are burning around her bed.
Too late ! Too late ! For my love lies dead
In the town of Alcalar.

A Leak Discovered.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O BROTHERS ! I've lost something !”
Every Link rose. All the ladies
gathered up their tails, and the gentle-
men looked under the seals and searched the
(ground) floor of the tribal den ; but there was
nothing lying round—at least nothing that would
pawn.
“Is this it?” said a wag, holding up a bone
that he had just'finished gnawing.
“You don’t mean this, do you?” said another,
indicating his own yery fat, lazy self stretched out
comfortably in the corner he generally mono-
polised.
It was something to make fun of—a Link
losing anything. We were fairly self-contained at
that time.
“ Perhaps it will turn up later,” said a gentle
creature, sidling up to him somewhat shyly. She
was one of those soft little things with a trusting
eye and light-brown fur, and her fur was so even
and sleek that no Link could ever pass her with-
out giving it a smooth or two with his paw. If
anything could comfort one, surely it would be
that little marmozet nestling against you—you
would think.
“ It will be all right, Bandy ; you'll find it
sometime when you’re not looking for it,” she
purred. But he sprang up with horror and con-
viction on his face. “ Never ! never ! never !! ”
he shouted. “ I seem to know it ! I feel it
here ! ” —he touched his forehead. All knew it
must indeed be serious if he felt it there. “It
will never, never, come back to me ! It is lost !
lost ! lost! ! and I will never see it again,
never ! ”
The heart-wrung cry aroused general sympathy.
Every sound was hushed ; every tail was still. For
bowels of compassion had not long been invented,
and there had not yet been time for them to be-
come unfashionable.
“ Where did you leave it ? ”
“ Leave it ! I don’t remember leaving it !
I never seem to have had it. That’s what
puzzles and grieves me ! ”
“ Never seem to have had it ! Why, you said
you lost it ! ”
“ I might have.had it ! ”
“What ! And forgotten you had it ?”
“No, no, no, no! I mean I seem to have
been able to get it, but neglected to do so ! ”
“ Oh !”
“ A lot of us are in that boat often enough, if
that’s all! ”
“ Why, last night I missed as fine a little”
“Yes, that’s enough of you! Was it a
cocoanut you lost, Bandy ? ”
“No.”
‘ ‘ Kidney fat ? ”
“No, no ! Something infinitely more precious.
Something I must have. If I could but think
what it is. O, it’s maddening! My brain tells me
I cannot live a moment without it, and yet it flies
away and will not stay —is gone, gone for ever! ”
“ But you are alive all right, Bandy dear! ”
“I know, I know, I know! That’s what
drives me mad. I can’t live without it, and yet
here I am ! It is lost, and can never be found,
and yet I feel I must have it, and can’t even tell
what it is ! Isn't it enough to make one rave? ”
“ Where did you keep it?”
“Keep it!! I didn't keep it. Don't I tell
you I lost it,”
“Hang it! I mean when it was not lost, of
course. Where was it then ? ”
“How do I know? I’ve never seen it.
All 1 know is that I woke up, and then knew
that something, if I could only tell what it was,
had gone—something that I ’ could have taken
and enjoyed if I had been awake, but now it will
never come back to me. I can’t think what on
earth it is, but I know all that about it, as well
as I know I’m living.”
“Do you suspect anyone ? ”
A roguish, rough-haired, ambiguous-looking
object in one of the corners here unrolled itself
and pricked up its ears. “This is going to be
my funeral, I can see,” was the sort of air it put
on as it sat up and looked round sleepily and
sheepishly at the company.
For whenever stealing was hinted at, everyone
naturally thought of Blinky, who passed all his
waking moments at burglary, and would steal a
Link’s tail off him while he was asleep if he could
have sold it, or fixed it on himself and worn it.
“Do I suspect anybody? No, it's only my
own fault. Besides, it was no use to anybody but
me. In fact, it was not possible for anyone to
have my part of it but me.”
Blinky here dropped down and coiled up again.
Anything that it was not possible to stop anyone
else from owning had no interest for him.
“ Then, of course, you must have it on you now
somewhere.”
So Bandy was searched, much to his impatience
and annoyance. Everyone took a hand. Not a
Link in the place but thumped and scratched
every inch of him all over.
“ Is it a small thing ? ”
“ No, no ! Get out ! I've told you. Small
THE LESSER EVIL.
AGED DERELICT : “ Excusin' the liberty of arskin of a favor, Mum, but would yer object

SOFT-HEARTED WOMAN : “ Poor old man , you had better come up to the house , and I will
give you the remains of my Christmas pudden. ”
AGED DERELICT : “ Don't put yerself to the trouble , Mum. I'ave a packet of Rough on

thing ! —it’s the biggest and most precious thing
in all our lives.”
“ Oh, then I know what it will be. It’s the
thing inside him—the thing that thumps. They
say if you lose that you can’t live.”
“Well, then, he hasn’t lost that,” said the
little soft-eyed one that lay against him with her
ear on his breast, “because I can hear it beating ! ”
And she cuddled in closer.
For there was no mock modesty on either side
in those days. If a feller wanted to, he just took
his best girl on his knee anywhere they happened
to be—in the Town Hall, or in church, or on a
tram in front of all her aunts —and no one thought
anything of it. She patted his arm gently, while
he went on droning, half to himself, “ It’s not
only my loss ; we’ve all lost it. It’s something
that belonged to all of us, it is ”
“ What ? ” “ Here I say ! ” “ That’s another
matter !! ” “ Was it anything of mine ?”
Ominous furrows dented themselves on the
limited brow of the Boss Link.
“ Yours ! Mine ! Everybody’s ! We all own
it ! We have ”•- --
“Well ! I can’t say I've noticed anything
missing lately ; but haul that Blinky out, for a
start! ”
Blinky didn’t want to be searched ; but many
hands made light work of that, and out of his lap
fell one of the chief’s favorite shying flints ground
on eight sides, and an exploration of the ground
around him revealed quite a number of things that
had been forgotten for months.
O, the ungovernable rage on the face of the
Boss Link as, with furious snort and lashing tail,
he shot Blinky out in front of him at the end of
one of his great arms.
“ You incorrigible scoundrel ! If there was a
dinosaurus handy I’d chuck you into his mouth,
blowed if I wouldn’t. Here ! Go and bunk on
your own, y’ thief! If I ever catch you in this
cave again, you’ll be the second course on the
Sunday after ! See ! ” And out flew Blinky
through the mouth of the cave.
“ And you, Bandy, why couldn’t you have told
us all this before, and not been so roundabout
with your ‘ Ah mes ’ and your ‘ lost ! lost ! lost ! ’ ?
Are any of these things here yours ? ”
“ Ah no,” said the afflicted one, and he seemed
to be looking through the back of the mountains.
“That which I have lost is nothing that can be
seen. It cannot be seen, it cannot be heard, it
cannot be felt, it cannot be smelt, it cannot
be ’ ’
“ D n! ” said the Boss Link. “It can only
be lost it seems, and ain’t much to lose either, it
strikes me. I think you’re well chuck of it ! I’m
sick of the whole thing ! ”
* * * *
O, men and brethren ! Of the mental throes that
the Links were sometimes plunged into in those
dawning days, when heads began to be fitted with
compartments for cogitation on the abstract, not a
tenth part can ever now be known !
Bandy, groping about for a foundation that he
could rest on, in his stumbling half-conciousness
of the existence and nature of Time (a knowledge
almost assumed now by every child as a matter of
course), was a type of this struggling and was no
great company for his fellows while he was at it.
He spent his days sitting at the foot of a tree
and arguing with himself about it, holding his two
hands out in front, and incessantly chucking the
arguments from the finger-points of one hand on
o those of the other (a new and useful invention
that had come out in the summer before). He
was mostly left to himself, and no one, save per-
haps the silky, Furred little female before men-
tioned, troubled much about him.
There would be an occasional “ Mornin’,
Bandy. Found it yet?” and a shake of the
head or two in passing, but nothing further. He
lived his own life —a kind of dotty one it seemed
to the rest of the Links.
Of course, something was bound to come of all
that thinking. In a week or two a change came
over the demeanor of Bandy. He stopped look-
ing as if he was worrying the deaf and dumb alpha-
bet for a wager, and commenced to sit still with
his arms folded, a marvellous peace o’erspread-
ing his countenance ; and the others marked the
change.
“ He’s found it at last ! ”
“Ten to one Blinky had it, after all! ”
He took no more notice of them, however, than
he did before. He still went on self-occupied,
not in the mad perplexity of his former method,
but evidently hopeful, and satisfied that he was on
a good wicket.
One day they saw him get two flat shells, with
mother-of-pearl insides. Then he half-filled one
with dry sand, and, fixing it up at an incline over
the other, watched all the sand sliding into the
lower shell.
When it had all gone he made a notch with a
flint in a stick he had. Then he changed the
shells, putting the full one over the other, and
went through all the same business again.
All the Links came round and watched him,
and thought it was very pretty. A lot of them
got shells and sand of their own and imitated him.
But Bandy kept at it, enthusiastically turning
his shells and notching his stick, because this was
the first Hour Glass in creation, and he knew it.
Bandy had, in fact, discovered, and was now
registering, Time !
The few days that were now passing were for
the human race (as far as knowledge of chrono-
logical phenomena is concerned) the most critical
in history, for if anything had happened to Bandy
in the interval between the moment when he
actually discovered Time and the moment when he
let others into the secret —the interval which he
spent in making sure of things, and constructing
his hour shells—the whole thing might have re-
mained unknown to this day !
There would have been no such thing as 7.30
on Wednesday night outside the General P. O. on
the pavement, or 4 0 clock in the morning
on the suburban doorstep ; and dinner would
have been any old time, and people any
old age they liked, and a Link might go down to
his office at midnight instead of 9 a. m. and not
know the difference.
So, all unsuspected, the moments had been
fleeting, fleeting, fleeting. All the time the Links
had been doing things ; and when they had not, the
precious moments had been passing, passing, just
the same. “This leakage has been going on
perpetually, and we did not know it.” Strange it
had not been thought of before. Other, smaller
things the Links had compassed from time to
time, but this overspreading and enduring factor
had escaped them.
Now, thanks to Bandy, they knew it, and
would make the most of it.
They could not recall all the wasted—shock-
ingly wasted—years of the Links that had gone
before them ; but they could at least do the best
with the present, and see that none of the new
Time was wasted in the future. Lying down in
the grass doing nothing was prohibited, and bands
of enthusiasts went about and chopped “Time
Flies?” on the bark of trees, so that no Link
should be ignorant. This custom has survived to
the present day. Many an unthinking, wasting
man has the solemnity of Passing Time forced on
his notice by seeing the date of the coming year
tarred in figures 6ft. long on his fence on the
night of December 3 1.
Of course, they gave Bandy a dinner. We have
not changed much from our old Link fathers in
that. They celebrated everything by a dinner,
same as we do crucifixions and bowling-team vic-
tories.
Luckily, an embassy of four strange Links
was in camp at the moment —come on some busi-
ness about a strip of disputed clubbing country —
so they decided to send back the leanest with an
ultimatum and to keep the three plumpest, the
dinner to be for Thursday.
And a fine dinner it was. There was no
tobacco but plenty of after-dinner discussion.
“ Time, fleeting time, and w’hy it so fleetingly
fleets ? ” was duly toasted and talked over.
Said the responder to the toast :
“ I—er, er—have thought a good deal on this
matter of late, and—er—given it, I may say, much
anxious and earnest consideration. I hold, Mr.
Chair-Link, it is in the very nature of Time to
fleet (hear, hear), so whatever we do, I say, we
can’t have our cake and eat it too ; or, rather, we
can’t eat our cake and have it too.
“ Now, as you might say, about this foreign
Link we've just ’ad,” and he took up a shin bone
that was in front of him to illustrate (another
smaller bone hung to it by a piece of half-cooked
gristle, and wagged to and fro with curious inde-
pendence as he jerked the thing about in the
course of his elocution). “If we eat this ’ere
Link, as you might say Thursday—well, then, we
can’t ’ave’im on the Friday again, can we ?—’cos
he’s done for ! Well, same with Time. You use
it and it's done for, and I think this will turn out,
when we come to see things properly, the real
root of the matter.” And noticing that there were
still a few' pickings left on the smaller bone of the
two, he gave it a good overhauling with his
grinders, while another took up the tale.
“ Well, / think it’s rotten ! ” (This fellow had
one of those practical, hard-looking heads that
generally mean something—in fact, it was this
very individual that afterwards became so famous
and sent his name ringing up and dowm the con-
fines of Linkdom as the inventor of Rent.) “Yes,
rotten ! Here’s a thing, this ’ere Time, or what-
ever you call it, that you only get a bit at a time,
as it were ; that you must use up all at once or it
goes wrong on your ’ands ; that you can’t save up
and lay in like for a rainy day, however careful
you are. If you don’t ’appen to be in
the humor for a chunk of Time, you
lose that lump for ever. It’s gorn, and
you haven’t another chance for it ! Now, if
it’s cocoanuts or flints you can save ’em up, and
one becomes tw'o, and two four, and four eight, and
so on ; in short, they accumulate , and you have
alw'ays got’em to use when you like. But this
Time ! It’s rotten —there's nothing in it ! ”
Then a depressed Link took up the story.
“ It’s all very well airing our own. little ideas,
gentlemen, but the hard fact remains that Bandy
says Time passes, that it is going. Time flies. It
w'ould not be so bad if it only flew' in the daylight,
but, as Bandy has shown us with his little sand
thing, it goes in the night all the same.
“ Think what this means, Links ! It is awful !
It is worse than when we learned to count up to
ten. That something is always going ! going !
going ! never stopping—that Yesterday got killed
by To-day—the very same To-day that To-morrow
lies around waiting with a flint-axe for. Oh, it’s
horrible —too horrible ! ”
A tall Link also spoke :
‘ ‘ What / say is we’ve been done out of some-
thing to a good old tune. If this waste has been
going all the time, somebody’s had it. Where do
we come in? Think of all the Time that has been
used by the dead J uns ! ”
(“ Down with our ancestors ! ”)
“ If they'd been more careful there would be
more left for us now' ; w'e don’t owe them any-
thing.”
“ We should have eaten them.”
“Not a bone left on the plate ! ”
“ There’s nothing in it. ”
“Bah ! Your ‘solemn fleeting moment’, and
your ‘up and doing ’ ! I’ll lie down w'hen I like."
“ Down w'ith Bandy ! ”
“ Eat him ! ”
“ What I say is ”
But )ust then the saw-tusked elephantosaurus
put nis head in at the front of the cave, and the
meeting adjourned sine die and fled tumultuously
through the air-hole at the back.

Skeletons.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TPIE house with the shuttered windows stands
in the Valley of Tears,
Hard-by the banks of a river, which is
called the River of Years ;
No sun gets in at the lattice —light is barred out,
like a thief;
For it stands in a grim seclusion and nurses a
secret grief.
Once one got in, by a pretext, to let in the light
of day,
But the inmates gave him no welcome ; they
stared and they slunk away.
He was hardy, and opened a cupboard, the family
skeleton’s hutch ;
Pie found it was merely a humbug, but they
wouldn’t believe it such.
He called to the thing in the cupboard : “ Come
out, whatever you are ;
You are only some superstition, or a stupid sinis-
ter bar.
You impose on these foolish people, but you
couldn’t impose on me !
If you’re quite unfit for the daylight it’s buried
you ought to be.”
But the pride of those gloomy people still hugged
the .bones to its heart ;
They hurriedly closed the cupboard, and bade the
stranger depart.
They locked up the house securely, to harbor their
cherished grief,
And shut out the light at the windows, as though
the sun were a thief.
On the other side of the mountain is the Valley of
Calm Content ;
And a house looks down on the river, the River
of Days Well Spent.
The airs blow in at the doorways, and the win-
dows are open wide ;
And the sunlight, shot through the trellis, makes
a pattern of leaves inside.
It has had its share of misfortunes, for the Fates
are not wholly kind ;
It has buried the bones of its sorrows, and the
ashes went down the wind.
It has sloughed the prides that are hurtful, and
ever its doors are wide
Seek you in all its cupboards, but there’s never a
ghost inside.
For its strong sons take out the corpses as soon as
their hopes are dead ;
They bear them over the mountain, and dig them
an earthy bed.
They have buried full many a sorrow, of sins and
regrets a score;
They bury them, and they’re done with, and
trouble the house no more.
So there's never a haunting spectre to shadow the
passing days ;
And in at the open windows, cleansing, the sun-
light plays.
For what is well they remember, nor dwell they
with dead things pent,
In the pleasant house by the river, the River of
Days Well Spent.

Little Italy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AMID the hum of mosquitoes I rise to
another broiling day.
Taking the breakneck stairs at a stride
or two I reach the kitchen. It is hardly 6 o'clock,
yet the furnace is in full blare. From the door
a lick of its red tongue greets me. Its breath
singes me as I enter. It assails my nostrils with
the acrid smell of burning meat.
Before it stands what at first glance is the Devil.
With the stove lid uplifted he is burning things—
poking them into the heart of the fire with tongs.
But they are not souls—merely “ fries” which
have remained on hand till they have reached the
age of dissent, and are offensive even to the boss's
lenient nose.
He sports a red flannel shirt and flowing tie.
His fur cap has an upstanding ear flap, represent-
ing the wicked one’s horns. Flis foot is not
cloven. It is merely that a slit is cut in his shoe
for his bunion’s outlook.
Having jammed the last “fry” to perdition,
he slams on the lid, and I awake from my trance
to find that the new “ fries ” have been leaking
on me. Ugh ! Loathsome item of the menu ,
awaiting cooking, in a gigantic posy overhead.
Well, can’t you ged a move on ? ” inquires
the boss. “De table’s full of gr-r-easy blates
’ere.”
I follow the wave of his hand. Truly a
shuddersome sight of over-night supper dishes
awaits me—halves of lobsters, sodden salad, the
whiff of dying onions.
Counting myself indispensable in the establish-
ment, I insolently disregard the order. I will
make me a cup of tea. If it means the sack,
what matter ?
Courting dismissal assiduously, I sink upon the
flour bag and drink to better billets.
The baby-ridden missis trapses in. She picks
a quarrel with the boss on the instant, an offshoot
of one that has smouldered for days.
“ Turned Jimmie off, have you ? ’’ she taunts,
“ for a paltry matter of fourteen bob—him—with
a chicken’s appetite. Fill the beds with out-at-
e'bers I-talyans, will yer—with the stomachs of
ostriches that’ll ‘ return ’ and ‘ return ’ till I’m
sick o’ carving for ’em, an’ Jimmie ”
“Jimmie owe me two poun’ alreatty,” rejoins
the boss impatiently, “ an’ not anoder copper-r
will ’e add to ’ees scor-re—and den ’e ’ave de dam
impidence to ’ang roun’ my leetle gel.”
‘ * Little girl ! ” echoes the missis, hysterically.
“ Little girl ! Flo’s eighteen—the same age as
me when I was fool enough ”
The boss shrugs his shoulders.
“Good ’eavens! Oughtn’t I to know?”
shrilly demands the lady. “ And, ’sides all that,
Jimmie does well with the ’orses. Look at the
double he’s got —an’ a win yesterday too.”
“'Bah ! ” The boss expectorates into the ash-
pan.
The lady of the house casts outraged looks
upon the saucepans. She appeals to a slatternly
boarder, whose hair is too short for virtue, for
support.
“’Orze-razing ! Bah! Gard-blaying ! Yah!
’E’ll do a bit in shail yet, will Jeemie. Monny
sticks too easy to ’ees fingers—oder beople's
monny —my monny. Andreallo, of de yorse he
know notting—’e is nod so glever as Jeemie —
noh ” —here he again shrugs his shoulder—“ but
’e ’as de ’art cash alreatty. You marry ’eem to
Flo, ’e make a goot son-in-lah, an’ we get forty
poun’ into de dam beeziness.”
His prophecies are suddenly cut short. Some
one, intent on making soup, opens a cupboard
in the wall, and lets fall over him an avalanche of
humid bones.
The slatternly boarderess with the short hair
laughs wildly, but her enjoyment is marred by the
victim’s malignant smile. When the boss smiles
IN A CITY RESTAURANT.
HE (a very pastoral-looking personage): “I ordered lamb, Miss. What is this?”
S HE: “ The lamb , sir!”
HE: “ No, it isn't. It is rant, the father of many lambs.”
he looks like a midnight murder. He reaches for
a slate and dashes it down on the table.
“'Ere is your beel,” he says to the slatternly

’Urry an’ pay up queeck, or de tucker I refuce.”
«« “ ! ” A grinning orifice fills the shoot.
Mee-ilk! it howls.
mu \ , , , ... , r
The boss grabs a jug and a bill—-the one for
fluid, the other for explanation. “ Two quard,
two ’arf pind over-char-raged ! Ah ha, me fine
f ebab ! ’Ave you no preenciple ?In my coun-
res ~ , . . r , . . . ,
In tb us looking after his rights, the boss loses
valuable information. Unaware of a conclave
held in the pantry by his wife, his daughter and
the discharged Jimmie, he snaps his fingers at
Fate and the milkman,
Through the forenoon snarlings prevail. The
ac , idit >\ itse ! f ’ hands °?l slabs of cast-iron
steak to late breakfasters, with the polite hope
that it may choke them. A “grill” order she
takes as a personal affront. The last comer is
frankly informed that tea and coffee are both off.
The boss > working with a bottled violence that is
liable to boil over any moment, gets on my nerves.
A broken celery dish is the result. Yet “the
sack ” tarrieth. Clearly lam of much value,
I envy the waitress who, between screams of
“ Sossages,” gives notice through the shoot,
“ Yous can ’ire another girl, missis,” she says,
“ rbis P lace sults me > I don 't think ! ”
Yah! you can gerrout now, if you like ; sech
kVry tr . ro u op _i pay you too m y uch waitches .

“But,” says the waitress, quite unmoved,

Flo, in the tone of a highwayman, is now
demanding 9d. from her mother, with which sum
sbe P ro poses to buy openwork stockings. Clearly
meditates an outing, and would do it stylishly.
l havi [g been / ound sailin S
the bath, the shoes are left to dry-polish on the
stove, where, amid the general revolt, they roast
with a fearsome odor. Hanging upon the door
the “ Bill of Fare,” I find the outcast Jimmie
something of a hero outside. Though unable to
foot his “beel,” he is yet flush of coin, and is
shouting for sundry unemployed.
Shortly after twelve a mob of “coalies” swarm
into the dining-room like a plague of black
beetles. All is confusion and scuffle. Infirm
chairs, screeching on the tiles, are silenced as
heavy bodies descend upon them. A frayed-out
pensioner, who came early to avoid the crush, is
rescued from ’neath a bulky ganger whom hunger
has rendered savage. The boss bobs about,
colliding with everyone, and in his eagerness to
serve “ de customer ” allowing iron-shod feet to
descend upon his bunion without a cry.
The waitress, squealing her way through the
bill of fare, is cut short by violent interjections of
“ Steak’n’onions ! ” “ Roas’ beef ! ” “ ’Ash ! ”
Awaiting their orders, the “ coalies ” cut hunks
of bread, and, suffering from perpetual drought,
clutch with mighty hands the necks of water-
bottles and drain them at a gulp.
In the kitchen we dash about, snatching plates
and cabbage, and jostling the statuesque missis
for “cuts” off the joints. She, the while,
steadily condemns all creation to perdition. We
serve boiling soup and mop our steaming faces in
the overworked “ roller ” simultaneously.
The “coalies” are possessed by a fury of
feeding. All are gobbling. Knives, laden with
stew, are poised just without expectant lips while
the gobblers talk in hoarse, food-choked voices of
“ shifts” and “time.” Potatoes held within the
cheek look like strange growths. Through the
shoot the boss is seen. Beginning with his collar,
he sheds so many garments as to raise dark ques-
tionings as to his possible limit. Flis left arm is
piled with dishes, his right is draped with a
towel. With it he mops his face and polishes
“ the silver,” and performs generally.
When the last coin is taken the boss retires to
the yard, there to grind knives.
To him comes Andreallo. Andreallo lacks the
manliness of his brown and leathery uncle. His
face, fat and white, lurks in a jungle of whisker.
He wears a hunted look—possibly he fears Ven-
detta. Into his uncle’s ear he pours a tale of
woe. His love will have none of him. To him
she gives “ de cole look,” to his rival “dezmile” !
His escort to the football match, cautiously
offered, with a reference to thrift in the matter of
seats, has been scornfully refused. He threatens
to “take sheep” back to Italy. “I—-I will
marry with my countrywoman, an’ stardt de wine
beeziness. But leetle haf I spend in dis ’ole —I
’ate Australyah—l wand my own countree ”
The boss, alarmed that Andreallo's wallet with
its should return to the land of the date, gives
counsel. From Andreallo Aristide, Andrew ’Arris
must evolve; also Mr. Harris must drop his
mother tongue.
“ Learn to spik ees blanky slang—dat ees de
only way to blease de dam Australyan. Breet
de terrier —de black-an’-tan. Learn to keek ’ees
r-rotten football an’ shoudt ‘goal.’ Look at me
—why de dam larrikin comple-men’me on my
Englis’.”
Suddenly a horrid thought strikes him. Leaving
the grindstone to revolve alone, he advances to
his nephew’s ear.
“De monny,” he says, “ where ees it —haf
you eet in safe-ity ? ”
“ Si —in my ves’ in de cup-poart —in my ap-
parte-men’. You presente de key.” He outlines
a heavy key in his trousers pocket triumphantly.
But the boss looks doubtful. “De lock ees
dam-r-rotten —de monny would be better in my
’air trunk —no dam r-robber pick de lock under
my eye.” Andreallo replies by pressing the key
jealously to his shank, and scowling suspiciously
at his relative.
Resumes that worthy : “ Eet is no bad job I
offair you—constandt work, de bes’ of tucker, an’
a share in de blanky profids, if you trow your
monny in de buysness. Den Flo, she is a goot
gel, sbe will men’ your does an’ rear your bam-
bino.”
The craven Andreallo shuffles, but his masterful
relative drowns his quibbles.
“ You shall smarden yourself,” he says. “ Yes,
by crikey, you shall shafe your whisker—de dam
Australyan haf no use for ’em ? Get a glean shafe
at Br-rown. Say I send you. He weel do de
job for notting—de poh defil, ’e owe me foh de
meal an’ cannod refuce.”
Andrew’s whiskers rise to his eyebrows in
admiration of the boss’s cleverness in thus hold-
ing all Australia under his thumb, and he again
listens respectfully.
“A roll of serge I haf—a dr-runken sailor—he
owe me for a demijohn of wine, brought eet ’ere.
I ask no questions, but put eet away till de r-row
blow over. ’E god six monts. I will gif you de
serge foh your wedding outfid—an’ I haf seven
’ats. You can take your peek—shirds alzo—all
lef by de men on account of de beel. If we gome
to terms you share in dese peekings. Yes. By
Cri ! ”
Starting to put an edge on his carver, he says,
“ Naw need to fe-ah Jeemy” (buz-z —whir-r).
“ Flo weel nod marry ’eem while I am de boss ”
(buz-z-z). “’E is a dam scoundral. Yes! By
Jum —a larrikin ” (buz-z—whir-r). “I gif ’eem
tough meat to choke ’eem off, but naw, ’e ’as de
digestion of a dam r-rooster, an’ ’e back up ees cart
foh more” (buz-z —whir-r). “To blazes, I say”
(buz-z-z). “ Pay me for de tucker, I say, but
naw. He honor my ’ouse with ’ees custom, ’e
say, an’ if ’e should pay a sixpence off de beel ’e
haf de manner of King Emanuel ’eemself.
La-azy, useless tr-rash —’ eem my son-in-la’ ! Ha,
ha ! Saints in Heaven, I keek ’em to ’Ell first ”
(Buz-z —whiz-z—snap).
The broken carver whizzes into mid-air—and
the grindstone, spinning off, knocks the confed-
erates into the wash-house.
Later the boss, in his capacity as Master of
Destiny, plays a lonely game of skittles. He is
content. Has not Jimmy vanished ? Is not
Andrew ’Arris shedding his jungle of whiskers in
Brown’s saloon ? Shall not Flo listen to the
voice of authority ? But Fate, envious of his
peace, forecloses. She has a full hand. She
crowds his hour with tempest.
From different points bear down upon him a
bridal couple, a lathered Italian in full scream,
and an officer of the Law.
Dazed, inarticulate, stunned, his brain yet hears
the missis as she introduces to his notice Jimmy
and Flo, his wife. He grasps that Andreallo’s
money has been stolen to pay the wedding fees.
And he learns that in the clutch of Policeman X
Timmy shall go to pay the penalty.
WEEROONA.
A Luncheon Lyric.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OYSTERS skewered on a stick,
Hot, and beautifully browned;
Creamy soup, yet not too thick,
Teal so tender, plump and round ;
Tawny wine of subtle power—
These are yours this luncheon hour.
In the callow days that were
(Years ago) we might have strayed
With the grass-seeds in our hair
To some bosky picnic glade,
Where the blushing debutante
Shares her sandwich with the ant ;
While the lover peers and prowls
In the dry and dusty brake,
Terrifying slumbrous owls
Solely for Romance’s sake,
That his story he may tell
In th’ aforesaid bosky dell ;
Where the rustling branches speak
Of the couples come to woo,
And the brief expressive squeak
Tells what Algy tries to do ;
And the blowfly hums his tune
All the sultry afternoon.
These, and other joys to boot,
Have been stale for lustrums long ;
Grassy couches will not suit
With my spreading ong-bong-pong ;
Cosier are these crimson walls
Where no blazing sunlight falls.
Are we losers, growing old ?
Is the world less bright and fair,
Seeing we no longer hold
Cupid in the open air ?
And the charm has ceased to be
In the gummy picnic tea ?
Long ago, dear lady mine,
Roaming round by beach and fern,
Did we recken where we’d dine ?
Did we care when we'd return?”
Tea and scones at four or five
Served to keep our love alive.
Oh, the sentimental sin
In those young and foolish times !
Thirsty, you drank lyrics in ;
Hungry, I would give you rhymes.
Now, my lyric is—a lunch ;
Sonnets —chicken-wings you munch.
Now it matters what one eats
Ere one sets himself to woo :
Ev’n the nightingale of Keats,
Or the skylark Shelley knew,
Quicker to your heart would fly,
Baked, or bosomed in a pie.
So once moie your pretty lips
Press against the shallow glass ;
Cupid hastens, with those sips,
Through your happy veins to pass ;
And your soul, to sonnets deaf,
Melts before a cunning chef.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Boss of Flinders-lane died hard—his
heart of rags and dust
Half moistened by a blood so thin it looked
like water-rust ;
His dying fingers clutched a wharf, a warehouse
and a street ;
And then he passed, and lo! the Boss became
cold, senseless meat.
His starved soul took flight direct to Heaven’s
shining gate
(On Earth he’d always
had the best, and
Proud Men may not
wait);
Not to the ticket box
went he, where
common people
stand ;
lie strode to the dress
circle —hard of eye
but soft of hand 1
lie strutted up the stair-
case as if he'd been
there before ;
He said, in tones of
anger : “ What ?
My name not on
the door !
Pm the power behind
the Argus, 'so be
quick that I may
g°>
Or not a word here-
after in our columns
of your show.”
The usher fled to Peter
and explained the
shocking case—
A top-notch Soul was
asked to pay, like
common men and
base !
Said Peter : “No more
deadheads. ’Twas
no use for you to
call !
But, now you’re here,
I’ll find if you can
enter in at all.”
A shivering seized the Starved Soul. Said he :
“ I think I’ll pay.”
But Peter said : “A pauper you—you failed for
all to-day ;
The money that you lied to save will serve to kill
your heirs—
And not a penny’s yours to-day to pay your way
upstairs.
“And if you had a million here, ’twould be of no
avail ;
For, but for deeds, we every one would be with-
out the pale.
All credits here are noted during life ; and
balanced when
The Soul’s Account is ruled off as it leaves the
haunts of men.
“ Your name is Binns ! Hey ! Jonathan —bring
me the ledger B,
Subsection of Australia, and the index A to D.
. . . The folio’s nine million seventy thousand five
ought four.
Turn up the bill of Mr. Binns ; see if lie’s on the
door.
“What’s this? No credits here at all? The
debits very fat ?
Perhaps we’ve left out something, but we’ll take
your word for that.
No ! do not think to cozen us ! We know you
cannot lie !
This is the Place of Verity for him who comes to
die.”
Binns trembled for a thought, and all his actions
were uncouth ;
It knocked his manners endways, but he had to
tell the truth ;
He tried to utter things he’d said before he came
to die,
And he shivered at the knowledge that he could
not tell a lie.
It had been his only armor ; and he stood there
cold and stark ;
For deception all his lifetime long had hid him
likq the dark ;
A half suppression of the truth, his interests to
protect—
The draper’s smile, the grocer’s grin—and once,
the lie direct.
“Once,'’ said he, feeling for the words with lips
that ached with drouth.
“ Once when the Empire called for troops I fought
—by word of mouth.”
“The Empire,” Peter said ; “what’s that? A
star or land or sea ?
The only credits that can count are deeds that
made men free.”
“ Once,” said despairing Mr. Binns, through dry
and cracking lips,
“I made a speech against a strike affecting—all
my ships.”
“ A speech ! and ships! and trade! I do not
know these, Mr. Binns !
Tell us a deed of love you did, as discount for
your sins.
“ Shakspeare and Dante sit within—the great and
shining men !
The great of brain and good of heart do come
within our ken ;
And Jephthah's daughter sits and sings and smiles
with gracious lips,
And you ! You stammer there, and mouth—of
speech and trade and ships !

SERIOUS MATTERS.—ILLUSTRATED EXCERPTS FROM A PENNY DREADFUL.
“ Da Vinci, Titian, Angelo, do talk with Plato
there !
Bayard, Columbus, Milton, live in this divinest
air !
The common, goodly people here with them all
equal are—
For goodness rivals genius, and star doth rival
Star.
“ Millions on millions swarm they here —the
women true and good—
The heart that ached for suffering and the hand
that gave the food ;
The' lovers true, the faithful friends—know life
without surcease ;
And in his Hell groans Abelard—in Heaven
weeps Heloise.
“For Justice is the key of all our long account
with man ;
God scorns him not for scorning God ! Our
fixed eternal ban
Is for the man who killed his kind (poor strug-
gling earthworms both)—
The man who hurt his neighbor and the wife who
broke her troth.
“So though sad Heloise still loves, unhappy in
her light ;
Down in his Hell groans Abelard—a blinkard in
his night—
That is the penalty of faith—the torture of the
true !
For Abelard his wormwood has, and Heloise her
rue.
“ So, think you well, and guard you well, this
essay, Mr. Binns !
Down in its cave your conscience sweats to burn
you for your sins !
Yet have we justice tempered much for you, the
small and weak —
So think you of the works you did —protect your-
self and speak ! ”
Said Binns : “ To Melbourne Hospital I gave a
hundred pounds ! ”
Said Peter : “ ’Twas election time and you were
on the rounds !
You wanted then the vote of every poor con-
stituent.
What's charity in Flinders-lane in Heaven's adver-
tisement ! ”
“The Woebegone,” said Binns, “went down
with every man aboard.
I gave a big subscription for the widows from my
hoard.”
“You owned the Woebegone and overloaded her
with coal—
And she saved her full insurance; but she will
not save your soul.”
“ I had a faithful clerk who many years had
worked for me ;
I gave him lots of mining shares —when old I set
him free ”
“You set him free,” said Peter, then, “ to starve
upon your dole.
Your scrip was worse than worthless. Try again
to save your soul.”
And back in dimmest mem’ries Binns remem-
bered something good
He had done when poor and struggling—ere his
heart had turned to wood ;
When he worked from dawn to dark to keep the
girl who wore his ring.
She wore his heart within her eyes —sweet-serious
as the Spring.
They both had wearied of their world—their
world had dirtied them
With selfishness, success and gold, and many an
icy gem ;
And now his wife, who once his girl, was dead
and gone before—
And, though he knew she was not there, he tried
at Peter’s door.
For love had gone, and kindliness, with friend-
ship, trust and truth ;
They did not know the loving soul that keeps the
heart of youth.
They would not hear the wondrous song of life
that poets tell ;
And he tried hard for Heaven, though he knew
she was in Hell.
And in his coward fear of pain he blessed that act
of old,
THE EXPLOSION.
EDUTOR : “Is this—er — joke one of your own? ”
HUMORIST (proudly): “ Yes.”
EDITOR (savagely): “ Get out of my office! ”
When he was poor and friendless and the world
was blue and gold ;
When the sun rose from Her eyelids—the Girl
who wore his ring—•
When he drew each breath in thankfulness and
taught his soul to sing.
“In ’seventy-four in dire distress a widow came
to me,
And I gave her half my money, and I made her
dwelling free.
I had only left, to last a month, two pounds —or
more, or less ;
Burning with shame I ran away when she
began to bless.”
“And that is all of good I did —not as advertise-
ment !
Save being careful of my home—being paid by
home content !
But never said I such base things or ere I
came to die ;
And now I’ve lost my
self-respect! I cannot
tell a lie.”
Said Peter : “ Pity ’tis
that you kept not
your Soul as young
As when you drew the
thankful breath and
spoke the honest
tongue ;
Your one white deed is
lost among the endless
debits black ;
And God can make a
world all new—but
God can’t turn a track.
“ For Justice is for you,
and me, and God, and
every man !
The lawns of Heaven for
Heloise ; for Abelard
—the ban !
Not good enough for
Heaven are you—not
true enough for
God !
Down to the Hell your-
self hath made, and
take your two pounds
odd ! ”
Down to the labent ways
of Hell shivered the
soul of Binns ;
Down to the place of
his dead wife, who
dwelt there for her
sins !
Down to the pangs of
Abelard, whose groans
do never cease
For the thought of treason to his love—the
weeping Heloise !
He felt old ways slip from him as he strode the
Streets of Pain !
His heart of dust began to pulse—brave youth
was his again ;
No more he thought of self, but all of her who
wore his ring ;
The Girl with eyes so serious-sweet when he
taught his soul to sing.
He reached his cave flammivomous—a weeping
girl crouched there !
In dreams he seemed to know that form and
touch that raven hair ;
His sins of pride and greed and rage—her sin of
vain conceit
Began to fade when Peter waved him from the
Judgment Seat.
Their selfishness slipped from them—their canker
was above—
Hell’s acids searched below
the dross and found
the metal—Love !
She turned and ran to him
—all smiles and tears,
and worshipping;
And he saw his image in
her eyes sweet-
serious as the Spring !
Oh ! loud the pangs of
Abelard did sound in
sigh and groan !
Whispered the Girl in
piteous voice; “His
hell’s to be alone ! ”
“My hell is Heaven,”
Binns, laughing, said.
‘ ‘ We’ve balanced
Peter wise.”
Pie looked into her eyes
and saw his self-lost
Paradise.
“ Praise God that we togethei
erred, and sinned in equal
sum
The sins of vanity and pride ; to
pity’s call were dumb ;
Though conscience burn for ages
yet within the aching breast;
Hell’s acids leached the dross from us, and Love
will do the rest.
“ So come you, Girl, and kiss me quick, and trip
you as of old
When we were young and clean of heart, and
earth was blue and gold ! ”
They tripped a-down the slopes of Hell, and left
them blossoming !
She worshipped him with glancing eyes—sweet-
serious as the Spring!
VICTORIA.

The Great Need.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE little singers make their songs ; they
whine on every hand,
And every day they build a lay, conven-
tional and bland ;
They rhyme about the earth and sea, the woman
and the horse,
And each man counts himself to be a literary
force.
They sing sad, sentimental songs ; they babble of
bright moons ;
Their trochees tell of landladies and lodgers and
lagoons,
And if their theme be not of love they glorify the
Push
Or demonstrate in dactyls the weird sadness of
the Bush.
On nearly all unworthy things they feel strange,
little throes ;
They lavish easy-flowing tears upon Life’s minor
woes.
O men by little sorrows torn —with little joys in
view—
’Tis time some greater Bard were born to give the
note to you !
’Tis time the Master-Poet came, with bright, all-
seeing eye,
And heart and mind and soul aflame to lift men’s
thoughts on high,
To rouse them from the deadly sleep that holds
them overlong,
And quicken all the Nation’s life and sing the
Nation’s song.
From some Olympus of the South where all the
gods attend,
O singer with the golden mouth and thunder-harp
—Descend !
Speed—speed with voice divine and song like that
by Shelley sung,
And raise again the splendid strain of mighty
Milton’s tongue !
Australia waits. Her people sleep, yet some
there be who wake,
And through the gloom of Destiny they hear the
heavens shake !
O come with speed, and come with power and
grant us our desire,
And touch a continent to life and set a world on
fire !
* * • •
Our little singers feebly sound vain songs in drowsy
ears ,
They cannot see beyond the round of little hopes
and fears ;
IVe need a Bard whose voice shall ring triumphant ,
clear and strong
To free the Nation's frozen spring and sing the
Nation's song.
N. s. w.
O. C. CABOT.
The Mysterious Battleship.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HARRY TRUSCOTT put down his paper
with a smile. Lighting a cigarette, he
went leisurely over the article again,
Spread out over two columns of the morning
journal, it read thus :
IS SYDNEY DEFENCELESS?
An Extraordinary Occurrence.
Strange Warship Visits Harbor
Secretly at Night
and Disappears.
As if in confirmation of the persistent rumors of inter-
national unrest in the Northern Pacific, an alarming* piece
of news has leaked out which raises grave doubts of the
security of Sydney Harbor as a naval base. We are
enabled this morning, after the fullest inquiry, to assure
our readers that last Saturday night Sydney Harbor was
entered by a warship of some unknown foreign Power—a
warship whose presence near our shores was absolute! v
unsuspected by anyone, least of all by the British naval
authorities. Last Saturday all the vessels of the Aus-
tralian squadron except the Dingbat, which is in dock,
were at Melbourne; but unexpectedly two of the cruisers
returned two days ago, while the flagship, which left Mel-
bourne with sealed orders at the same time, has not yet
been reported anywhere. These strange movements have
naturally perplexed and alarmed the Australian people ;
but the hitherto unsuspected presence of a foreign battle-
ship in Port Jackson furnishes an ample explanation of
the situation.
On Saturday night—a night of driving rain—as we have
indicated, a strange warship slipped through Sydney
Heads unseen, explored the Harbor waters at least as far
as the naval anchorage at Garden Island, and as mysteri-
ously departed. That such a contingency could occur
may well seem incredible, yet we have the evidence of
three persons that a vessel answering the description of
no known warship of any naval Power did enter and
leave ihe Harbor without hindrance from our defence
forces.
The vessel was not seen to pass the Heads, though the
thick weather prevailing would screen any craft daring
enough to make the entrance ; but a member of the gar-
rison of Bradley’s Head Port made it out at about
1.35 a.m., feeling its way slowly up the Harbor from the
apparent direction of Manly. About 10 minutes after-
wards the vessel almost ran down two fishermen in a
boat off Fort Denison. These, as far as we can ascertain,
were the only witnesses of the presence of the warship ;
but their evidence is unimpeachable. The man at the
fort states that, during a lull between the rain-squalls
he made out, though indistinctly, a ship with two funnels
and armed with heavy guns. It showed no lights except
the usual red and green. The two fishermen were too
busy getting out of the warship’s way to notice its exact
appearance or size ; but they assert that it had one
peculiar feature—its smoke-stacks were arranged a-beam.
This novel method of construction, evidently for the
greater range of the big guns, marks out the vessel as one
of mystery.
Unfortunately no one observed the ship leave the
Harbor ; but in weather so terrible ilfc could have slipped
out as secretly as it entered.
What was the purpose of our m vsterjous visitant ? The
Harbor mining launch has been observed busily dredging
the last three days, which gives color to the obvious sug-
gestion that the warship came to lay mines. But, in the
course of our inquiries, the mining detachment denied
any purpose except the usual periodical inspection of the
mined portions of the Harbor.
Australia, however, may be assured that, with our
defence forces keenly on the alert, a repetition of such an
impudent visit will be provided against in the future. It
is possible that the visit was merely an experiment in
view of future possibilities ; but the next time a foreign
battleship presumes to enter the Harbor of Sydney, it will
not leave except with our permission.
Harry Truscott carefully cut out the article,
and, going to his desk, took out a letter the lavish
caligraphy of which betrayed its writer’s youth
and femininity. Glancing over this with a smile,
he pinned it to the newspaper article and put it
away in a large drawer among a pile of envelopes
neatly tied up in ribbons of a diversity of shades.
Even in his love affairs, Harry was always
methodical. He still recalled with a shudder the
occasion when he had written to Peggy and called
her Polly. Till that unfortunate, but quite ex-
cusable, slip, Peggy had been unaware that there
was a Polly, and Polly had required a lot of
futile explanation. Since then Harry had made
it a rule never to fall in love at the same time
with two girls whose names began with the same
letter.
Upon that fateful Saturday evening Harry
Truscott and the Kid left their club towards the
middle of the night, and hurried through the
driving rain to the Quay, where he had left his
motor-launch, the “X,” lying. Harry had a
hatred of breaking off a game of bridge in order to
catch the last boat for Neutral Bay, so he always
took his launch. This evening he had been
teaching the Kid bridge. His real name—but
since he was always called the Kid there is no need
to burden the reader with his real name. With
his chubby cheeks and curly hair and expres-
sion of innocent youth, he could not escape his
nickname. He had the useful habit of looking
nineteen, but this evening Harry had been be-
guiled by that radiation of extreme youth to
double no trumps, and the Kid had pocketed
Harry’s five pounds with a pensive smile.
As they hurried along with bent heads they ran
into a small crowd upon the pavement in front of
a hotel. In the centre of the knot of lookers-on a
man was being carefully lifted into an ambulance
stretcher.
“ Slipped on the pavement cornin’out of the
CHUNK FROM AN ABORIGINAL BIBLE .
“And the serpent tempted her. and she did eat.”
pub--too much beer,” explained a man. “ ITe’s
only stunned.”
“ Who is he? ” asked Harry, catching a glimpse
of the man’s face.
“ Looks like a seaman—-mate or somethin’.”
Harry pushed his way to the stretcher.
“ Do you know him, sir ? ” asked a policeman,
notebook in hand.
Harry, after a careful look at the man, shook
his head. “ I’ve seen him before, but I can’t
quite place him.”
“ He’ll be all right. We're talcin' ’im to the
’orspital.”
The crowd dissolved. Plarry and the Kid
hurried on.
As they passed the Manly wharf a girl rushed
from a tram and was stopped by a man shutting
the big doors. Plarry and the Kid paused.
“Too late, Miss,” said the man. “Last
boat’s gone ten minutes ago. ”
“Oh, but I must get down to Manly to-night.
I simply must ! ” the girl gasped in dismay.
Despite her heavy cloak Harry could see that
she was daintily dressed, young—and beautiful ?
No ; he couldn’t be sure without staring ; but it
seemed to his volatile heart that in some indefin-
able way she was .. . Different. That was always
the first sign with Harry.
“She’s a stunner !” enthusiastically breathed
the Kid ; and somehow Harry was faintly
annoyed. It was one thing to find out for your-
self that a girl was Different. The Kid had evi-
dently found out that she was something more.
“ Sorry, Miss,” repeated the man impatiently ;
“but there’s no way of getting to Manly to-night
—a night like this, too ! ”
“ But it is most important. I don’t know what
on earth I’ll do if I don’t ” The poor girl
broke off hopelessly with a gesture of despair
that at the same time broke and mended Harry’s
volatile heart.
Harry and the Kid raised respectful hats.
She stared and did her best, with poor success,
to make her face freeze.
“ Pardon me, madam, but if it is absolutely
necessary for you to go to Manly to-night there
is a motor-launch lying here at your disposal.”
(The remarkable thing about this speech was
that it was uttered by the Kid.)
Over the girl’s face flowed a wave of relief,
immediately obliterated by a look of hopeless
distrust.
“ But,” she began—then, desperately, “ I don’t
know you, do I ? ”
“ I am sorry to say that till this moment we
have not met,” said Harry with suppressed
enthusiasm. “It has been gross and inexcusable
carelessness on my part, I admit. But my launch
is lying here. She goes 23 knots, and in about a
quarter of an hour I can land you at Manly. I
happened to overhear you say that it is of the
utmost importance for you to reach Manly
to-night ”
“ I live there —it is most important,” she
admittedly eagerly ; then, almost unwillingly, she
added, “but I don’t know either of you gentle-
men. It is very kind of you, but ”
Her hesitation was as evident as the no-
surrender in her youthful voice. Harry signalled
to the waiting wharf-man.
“ Please introduce me to this lady,” he said.
The man grinned. “This is Mr. Truscott,
Miss ; ’e owns" the ‘ X ’ —fastest launch in the
’arbor, Miss. ’E’ll get you there to-night in no
time. She’s a flyer, Miss.”
“ I’m pleased to meet you, Mr. Truscott,”
said the girl, with a dawning smile and obvious
relief in her voice. “ But won't you please in-
troduce me to your friend ? ”
Harry impatiently introduced the Kid, and the
girl admitted that her name was Castlereagh.
Harry could not remember having ever been in
love with a girl whose name was Castlereagh. It
lent piquancy to the situation.
“Here’s the launch,” said Harry, and carefully
he helped her to embark in the little frail-looking
craft. “ Better put on this,” he said, handing
her an oilskin that he used when racing. “ It’s a
terrible night ; you mustn’t spoil your dress.”
The girl donned the ugly coat with a gleeful
laugh. It was to be a night of adventure, and,
like all her sex, once embarked upon an adven-
ture she put all her distrust away. She had
the instinct for romance.
Harry, looking up from the engine, thought
that the Kid was a long time making Miss Castle-
reagh comfortable in the stern.
They slipped past the big Japanese and P. and
O. liners at half-speed. Rounding the wharf
Harry put the “X” at its full velocity, and some-
thing happened.
“Quick! Hard over !” he cried to the Kid.
The engine had unaccountably stopped. The
way on the launch brought it alongside the wharf.
They made fast to a pile.
“ Afraid it’s no use, said Harry, after a hasty
examination of the engine. “ Never knew it to
happen before.”
(This remark is authorised for use in these cir-
cumstances by Rule 15 of the Sydney Motor
Launch Club. It has been found extremely con-
venient. )
“Oh!” said the girl in a tone of hopeless
despair that reminded Harry of Lucy when
she told him she could never be his. Lucy used
to tell him this once a week.
It was either the despair or the remembrance
that decided Harry. I fancy it was the despair,
because Harry could never resist despair when it
was combined with wind-blown brown hair and a
divinely-pouting mouth.
“I promised I would get you to Manly to-
night,’ he said, “and I will.”
“ But your stupid launch can t go.”
“ But I can.”
“ Not in fourteen minutes. ’
“We must get ashore, Kid,” he curtly said.
She of the pouting mouth had called his launc
“stupid.”
They climbed up on to the deserted rain-swept
wharf. . ,
“ Now we’ve got to get across the harbor in tne
all-night boat, Miss Castlereagh, and I’ll get a
vehicle and drive you to Manly.”
“ But that will take us hours.”
“ Is it really important that you must get there
this night?” .
“Yes, Mr. Truscott. I live there. I simply
must.”
“ That settles it.”
They started to walk back along the wharf to
the Quay. . , ,
“Hullo!” said Harry, peering through the
rain ; “ here’s the horse-ferry. What’s she doing
here? She ought to have left half an hour ago.
He noticed a man who was smoking beneath
the shelter of a shed.
u You, Bloggs,” he said, recognising him.
(The story of Bloggs, ex-A. 8., may be told
another time. Owing to that estimable but
egotistic seaman’s little difference with the
Admiral, Bloggs was, with Harry’s help, tempo-
rarily in concealment and following the humble
but unobtrusive calling of engineer-in-chief of the
horse-ferry that made 34 trips across the
harbor every day. Also, for purposes of dis-
guise, he was smoking a cigar and growing a
moustache.)
64 Yes, sir,” said Bloggs, with a quick look over
his shoulder ; “ but if you remember, Mr. Trus-
cott, my name is Smith.”
Harry remembered that it was Smith. “ Well,
why is the ferry here ? ”
“ Waitin’ for the captain, sir.”
“Where is he?”
“ Don’t know, sir. He went up the Quay.
Between you an’ me, sir, I think he s in the pub.
though that’s agin rules—and it’s after closin’
hours, too.”
Harry turned to the Kid and surprised that
youth holding Miss Castlereagh s hand. He ex-
plained to Harry that he had been telling her to
keep her courage up.
“ Kid," said Harry, “ you remember that chap
we saw in the stretcher ? I knew I’d seen him
before. He’s the captain of this derelict ferry-
boat. He knows me, too. Once or twice, when
I’ve slipped under his bows—if that tub can be
said to have bows—he’s said some emphatic things
about motor-launches. Well, Smith, your captain
has had a fall and been carted off to the hospital. ”
“Then how are we going to get across the
harbor and to our berth for the night?” said
Bloggs who was called Smith.
Harry had his usual inspiration. “ I’ll navi-
gate the old tub for you,” he announced.
Bloggs pulled at his new moustache. He
hadn’t quite got over the coy delight of fingering
it. “ Don’t seem quite proper, sir. But we’ve
got to get over somehow. Can't stay ’ere all
night.”
“That will save us the wait for the all-night
passenger ferry,” explained Harry to the girl.
“ We’ll be there in no time.”
The four walked to the horse-ferry, Harry in
earnest and confidential converse with Bloggs. The
Kid, who followed with Miss Castlereagh’s trust-
ing little hand in his, was surprised to notice that
Bloggs seemed protesting against something Harry
had said ; but the faint pressure of that trusting
hand in his put all other thoughts out of his head.
The Kid’s cranium could hold only one idea at a
time; and this was an idea worth holding for
quite a long time.
There was nobody to observe them as they got
on board. Harry mounted to the bridge, a
passable imitation of the burly figure of the cap-
tain in his stiff oilskins. Bloggs spoke a weird
to a hand crouching behind the deck-house,
and he came quickly out. At Harry’s gruff
command he cast off the ropes and the horse-
ferry slowly edged its way out. A moment later
Harry looked round, and found the Kid and the
girl behind him on the little structure that
sheltered the wheel.
A few minutes later the deck-hand appeared at
the top of the tiny companion way.
“ Beg pardon, sir,” he said, “ but aren’t you
sawin’ ’er off a bit too much to the offside ? ” (In
the horse-ferry service they have a discipline and a
stable slang of their own.)
“You mind your own business,” said Harry,
gruffly, without turning.
But the deck-hand knew his captain, drunk or
sober.
“ Who the "ell are you? ” he said.
Harry dropped the wheel and in a moment had
him on the deck. With the Kid’s assistance the
mutineer was tied up. Miss Castlereagh, white
but thrilled, lent her silk scarf for the purpose.
“ There’s only one stoker down below,” said
Harry, “ and Bloggs ’ll look after him.” He put
the wheel hard over.
“Why, what are you going to do ? ” the girl
asked. A wonderful suspicion had come into her
mind that this very young-looking man with the
very grown-up ways had conceived the romantic
adventure of running off with her. And in her
uneventful life this was the first time any young
man had evinced the slightest desire to run off
with her. She thought with a certain shame-
faced satisfaction that she was quite powerless.
Yes, she repeated to herself, as if in excuse, there
was no escape for her—even if she wanted to
escape. Of course sfee wanted to escape, but not
just yet ; it was rather pleasant there in the little
deck-house, sheltered from the rain, and with the
pleasant feeling that beside her was a young man
who palpably approved of her. If running off
with her in a horse-ferry boat, and a probable
desperate career of piracy upon the high seas to
follow, wasn't flattery, she had never been
flattered.
From these delicious but dangerous dreams a
memory of her mother awoke her.
She straightened herself. “What are you
doing, Mr. Truscott?” she peremptorily de-
manded.
“ Merely taking you to Manly, as I promised,
Miss Castlereagh. I said I’d get you there to-
night —or rather this morning. This snub-nosed

old tub isn’t built for speed, but it ’ll be quicker
than driving, anyhow.”
“ Oh i” she said, with a drop in her exaltation
that she thought was relief. The days of romance
were dead. Young men no longer took to piracy
to prove their love. She would have to be satis-
fied with a society wedding after all. Yet here
was a man who had laid himself open to a
housand dangers for the sake of her. “ You’re
going to a lot of trouble for me,” she said.
She spoke to Harry, but she looked at the Kid.
“ A woman in distress ”... muttered Harry,
without a look at her. He was trying to make out
his course in the driving rain, and he was experi-
menting in the new art of horse-ferry steering.
But the Kid squeezed her hand encouragingly,
and it is possible that she might have, in turn,
encouraged the Kid.
So the old ferry-boat, like a gallant steed
gathering himself for his last jump, ploughed its
way blindly through the wind and the darkness
tand the rain.
“ Captain ! ” came a shrill feminine voice from
the darkness of the deck.
The three individuals in the deck-house jumped.
Who had in this mysterious fashion boarded the
vessel in the dark ? Harry peered down and
dimly made out a figure with upturned face.
“ Who’s that ? ” he sharply queried.
‘ ‘ I am a woman. ”
As if that explained everything !
“ Plow dare you —a woman—board my vessel
without the master’s permission ? ” Harry gruffly
asked.
There was a simple, severe dignity in the
woman’s voice as she replied, “I am a passenger.”
Plarry had never thought of passengers.
“ And where did you come from ? ” he asked.
“Out of my buggy. It’s waiting in the front
part of the ship.”
“You have no right to leave your horse unat-
tended, madam,” said Harry with gruff severity.
“Please look after your horse, and leave me to
look after my ship.”
“ My niece is in the buggy,” was the woman’s
response.
“ Her niece 1 ” groaned Harry. “ She makes
another witness. We’ll never be able to convince
them all that this is the ordinary round trip for
collecting forgotten passengers on rainy nights.
What’s to be done, Kid ? ”
It was Miss Castlereagh who replied. “ Decoy
them both up here and then tie them up 1 ” Miss
Castlereagh had already embarked upon her
career of undiluted piracy.
“Here, Kid,” said Harry, “ just go for’ard and
rout out that niece and her aunt, and bring them
both up here. I must explain it all to them.”
The Kid picked his way down to the deck, and
disappeared into the darkness. It was quite a
time before Plarry made out three figures on the
deck.
“ I’ve got ’em all right, captain,” came the
Kid’s cheerful voice, “ but they won’t come up.”
“Not till we know where you are taking us,”
added the woman’s determined tones.
“We’re making the round trip to-night,
madam. We’ve got orders to land a passenger
at Manly. If I’d only known you were on board
I would have called in at Milson’s Point and put
you ashore. But now, as we’re nearly at Manly
—at least I hope we are, because I don’t know
exactly where we are—you’ll have to wait till the
return trip.”
“Aunt !” came an agitated whisper from the
deck, “ it sounds remarkably like llar—, I mean
Mr. Truscott’s, voice.”
Harry preserved silence. Now who was that
niece whose voice he remembered but could not
“fix”? He ran expeditiously over all the girls
he had been in love with, and somehow there
wasn’t one who, in some exasperating way, hadn’t
been the niece of somebody. If only he could
see her.
“ Mr. Truscott 1 ” said the aunt. “If it’s Mr.
Truscott masquerading as the captain of this
vessel, I’ll soon ”
She hopped briskly up. The niece and the
Kid followed.
Harry gave them one look.
“ Lucy 1 ” he said under his breath.
It was the Lucy who, twp years ago, had got
ENCOURAGING SPREAD OF UNION VIEWS.
KING BILLY ( who has been put on to shear stragglers): “ That pfeller blackleg , boss.
Baal mine tchear alonga scab .”
into the habit of informing him that she could
only be his sister. After a painstaking effort he
had discovered that he had over-estimated the
strength of his brotherly affection. Latterly he
had lost sight of Lucy.
“Mr. Iruscott,” said Lucy, severely, “so you
are at your games again. And wiLh a—a
person - /
The glance she flashed at Miss Castlereagh
almost cost Lucy a handful of her pretty bronze
hair. Luckily, the Kid interposed,
Meantime Harry carefully attended to the
wheel.
“ I know what you’re doing, Mr. Truscott,”
said Lucy’s aunt. “ Lucy has mentioned you
before. You’re eloping with this—this lady to
some desert isle. It is lucky that I arrived in
time to stop it.”
“ Has every woman deep in her heart the idea
that, at this period of the world’s history, hordes
of eligible young men are roaming the earth seek-
ing to run off with beautiful girls to desert isles ?”
Plarry made this remark confidentially to the
wheel.
“ I demand to be taken back immediately,”
continued Lucy’s aunt.
“ Sorry,” said Plarry. “ I’ve got to make that
desert isle before morning or all your reputations
will be compromised.”
“ I shall certainly speak to my brother about it
- —if ever we escape alive.”
“ And who is your brother, madam?” Harry
said, more for the sake of being conversational
than for the information.
“He’s Chairman of Directors of the Horse-ferry
Company, and he’ll dismiss you to-morrow from
the service, and I’ll see to it that he doesn’t give
you a character.”
“ But, aunt,” expostulated I.ucy impatiently,
“ if he’s eloping to a desert island with this—this
person, he doesn’t care whether he’s dismissed.
Besides, I don’t believe that he’s eloping with her
at all. It is the young man who is holding her
hand so tightly that she is in love with.”
Harry swung round, and from the blush on the
Kid’s face divined the truth. He swore he would
never take the Kid with him again. Still he
seized upon the chance. There was a hint of for-
giveness already in Lucy’s eyes.
“That’s bo.” (Pie addressed the aunt.) “I’m
merely the commander, whose sympathy with
youthful love has led me to offer my help and this
erratically steering ship. The glamor of romance
is over us all, madam, and I appeal to you, as a
woman, not to oppose this desperate stratagem for
the happiness of two devoted hearts.”
And neither Miss Castlereagh nor the Kid said
a word.
“ And if you distract me further from my duties
as master of this vessel, madam,” Harry went on,
“ all your lives will be forfeited. I have been
wondering, in the intervals of our conversation,
whether that was Bradley’s Head or North Head
we passed five minutes ago. If it was North
I lead', we’re now somewhere out on the Pacific
. . . and there are lives on board ” (he looked at
Lucy, then beamed on her aunt) “ that are more
valuable to me than any horse-ferry on the
harbor.”
“ Our deaths,” said the aunt cheerfully, “ will
be fin your head.”
“Yes, but you’ll be dead,” said Harry.
It turned out that it was Bradley’s Head that
they had rounded in the rain ; and shortly after-
wards the vessel found Manly wharf. The night
was so bad and the hour so late that there was
not a soul in sight. It was awkward work making
the unwieldy craft fast.
“ There, Miss Castlereagh,” said Harry
modestly, “ I have kept my promise.”
Miss Castlereagh looked so grateful that Harry
took a sudden decision. “ Kid,” he commanded,
‘ ‘ you take charge of the ship. I’ll see Miss Castle-
reagh to her home ”
“ Oh 1 ” murmured the girl with a little disap-
pointment. As she reached the deck she plucked
up courage. “ It’s so late. I’m sure they won t
be expecting me at home.”
“Won’t be expecting you?” gasped Harry,
pausing by the bulwarks. “But you said you
rpust get home.”
“Yes, but they didn't know that I was
coming.”
“But you said it was absolutely necessary for
you to get home ? ”
“So it is.” She went on serenely. Harry
w’as glad that neither the Kid nor the other
passengers could overhear her. “I simply had
to get here somehow to-night. You see, I went
up to town this afternoon to go to the opera and
stay the night with my married sister ; and at the
theatre the rain came on, and on Monday we’re
going shopping, and I had 'come up in my new
spring hat, and it would have been utterly ruined,
and I only wore it for the first time to-day 1 So
lhad to come back home to get my second-best—
it's a Paris model, but I made it up myself, so it
doesn’t matter very much if it is ruined. I’m
tired of it anyhow, and blue doesn’t suit me.
Besides I noticed two others like it in towm last
Saturday. But the new one ”
Miss Castlereagh was surprised when Harry
interrupted her.
“ I’m proud and delighted, Miss Castlereagh,”
he simply said, “ that I’ve been able to be of any
service. Any other time you require my assistance
I hope you’ll ”
“ Indeed I will f” said Miss Castlereagh with
enthusiasm.
Somehow, it seemed to Harry that, after all,
Miss Castlereagh wasn’t so Different as he had
hoped. Not so Different as, for instance, Lucy.
“ Kid,” he sharply called, “will you, please,
take Miss Castlereagh home. The captain cannot
leave the ship.”
The Kid leaped down the gangway. As they
stood one moment on the rain-swept wharf the
girl looked back.
“Thank you very much, Mr. Truscott,” she
called. “It isn’t every man who will go to the
trouble to steal a ferry-boat in order to take a girl
home to get her second-best hat. On the first
fine day I hope you’ll take me to tea in town, and.
you’ll see that it was worth all your trouble.”
Harry sadly climbed up to the deck-house.
The aunt met him with a new look on her face.
“ Now, tell me exactly why you took that girl
home. Do you mean to say that you did it all
•lor a hat ? ”
Harry briefly explained.
The old lady suddenly beamed. ‘ ‘ You did all
that for a woman’s hat ! Mr. Truscott, I must
apologise for my unkind opinion of you. I did
not know there was a man so chivalrous in the
world. I am always telling Lucy the modern
young man has no ideas of chivalry ; but a man
who, at great personal inconvenience to himself,
and incidentally to others, risks his life and be-
comes a pirate in order to save a woman's hat
from the rain—that man possesses an ideal of
womankind that lam compelled to reverence. I
shall not say a word to my brother of our delay.
Under the circumstances it was quite unavoidable."’
“ I would do as much,” said Harry modestly,
“ for the meanest of your hairpins.”
And she believed him. But it was from Lucy’s
eyes that he got his reward.
* * * *
The only incident of the return journey was thd
discovery of a fisherman’s boat almost under their
bows. However, the horse-boat answered its
helm sufficiently well to avoid running the small
craft down. They reached Milson’s Point about
2 a.m., and again found nobody to welcome them.
It cost Harry a five-pound note each to Bloggs,
the deck-hand and the stoker to keep their mouths
shut ; and his sole reward was that he was asked
to tea with the Kid. Miss Castlereagh wore her
new hat ; and though Plarry did not think it was
worth fifteen pounds and the risk of gaol, the
Kid’s admiration of it was simply sickening.
However, on thinking the matter over, Harry
set in the other scale of the balance the fare which
Lucy had gratuitously bestowed upon the captain
as her aunt was getting into the buggy. It was
evidently meant to be a sisterly kiss. Yet it
didn’t taste sisterly. But, then, Lucy always was
Different.

Footsteps in the Rain.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THRESHOLDS worn hollow with grinding
feet,
Blank walls and barrenness —this is my street.
The brown moss crawls on the broken ledge,
The sparse weeds push from the pavement edge.
The shrouded sounds of the city speak
Through the netted lanes from the square behind
All day, till the last low topaz streak
Slips from the roofs, and a questing wind,
Heavy with night and a thought of rain,
Fumbles the pane.
Then its haggard stones and its bare plots be
Vibrant with tense expectancy.
At the end of my street is a rust-clamped gate
Guarding a garden desolate,
Where thistle and lichened headstone lean,
Locked in a tangle of grey and green;
Sad-faced and shattered these headstones be,
Mottled and marred by the streaking tears
Shaken from sheoak and cypress-tree—
Where through the griefs of the mourning years
Trickle and drip to the dew below
Silverly slow—
(For sheoak and cypress and broom embrace
O’er the rank wet weeds of the burying-place).
Never the trail of a foot doth pass
Down the pathways blurring and grown with grass:
The blown leaves shrivel above them —these
Who huddle beneath the cypresses ;
But from coign and crypt, when the night
shakes down
The first full drops of the tapping rain,
They tread, through the void of the veiled wet
• town,
The maze of their living and love and pain ;
Wistfully close by the casement-glass
Loiter and pass,
Then in hurrying droves, as the storm racks free,
Stream on in a spectral symphony.
Chimed in the splashing from sodden eaves,
Rattling down with the driven leaves,
Chatter their myriad fitful feet
Who jostle Fate in the sightless street —
Lured by the loves they coveted.
Galled with the goading of white-hot Thought,
Scourged with regretting of speech unsaid,
Prayers that fell sterilely, sweets unsought—
Clanging on cobble, and soft on sod,
Patter and plod
Out to the blackness and back again,
Through the revel of gustily-rushing rain.
The step of the vagrant wife, without,
Doth weave with the lame man’s in and out,
And the child with the crone plods pace,for pace,
Till a shaken second’s silence-space
Plolds the cloven storm and my shrunk heart still ;
And close, through the cadence of clamant drops
That beat from the ridge and the running sill,
One soft, irresolute footfall stops
By the streaming ledge in the stricken calm.
And a shadow palm
Lies faint on the glass, and is guessed andgon.e
As the riot breaks on the roofs anon.
Naught is without but the wind and wet,
Yet I dare not (I dare not) look farther yet ;
And my threshing heart for a second stands’
Dead ; yet, for shame of my shaking hands
And the swift, cold throe in my mid-heart warm,
I have lifted the wavering blind, and lo !—-
Only the sweep of the slanting storm
And the swinging circles the street-lamps throw ;
Yet I fancied a footfall but now that trod
Yonder—ah God !—-
And a face that, whitening, turned, and then
Dimmed, and was drowned in the dark again.
Delicate, dimmed with our creeping breath,
Is the glass that doth sever our dreams from death,
And a flicker of shadows and sounds, me seems,,
Through this crystal that sundereth death from
dreams
Doth drift to the veriest self of me
In the dropping rhythm of steps I know,
And the fret of feet that I may not see ;
Folly of dreams 1 It is surely so 1
Yet hence, when the full years ripe and rot,
And the shattering rain-gusts lift and fall
Through the tangle of blind nights unbegot,
And the shrieking shutter flogs the wall—
Starting, with suddenly-ashen face,
By the chimney place,
In your heart's cold hush ye shall hear my feet
Pause by the pane in the sightless street.

The Garden of Desire.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BY height and hollow
Where scarce the swallow
Can find or follow
On flame-fleet wings ;
Through leaves that shiver
Above the river,
Where sunbeams quiver
In rippling rings ;
Through silent spaces
Where sorrow paces
’Mid mouthless faces
That fade and flee ;
Where no storm bloweth,
A garden groweth,
Untrod, still-hearted, beside the sea.
The long lands lighten
Where rollers smite in
Thunders that whiten
With crests of foam.
The wild, wet closes
Are faint with roses.
A wind that grows as
The sun sinks home
To seaward, lingers
With tender fingers
On trees that tinge as
When flushed with wine
A Bacchant’s face is—
A faun enlaces,
With fierce embraces
And eyes that shine.
As when Spring sallies
Forth from her palace,
And veils the valleys
With warm grey rain,
Till frosts that fettered
Are snapt and shattered,
And flowers are scattered
On hill and plain :
So, though snows harden
Without the garden,
Within ’tis starred in
A million hues,
Strewn without measure
Like a queen’s treasure
That waits her pleasure
To take and choose.
The tangled coppice
Is paved with poppies ;
Each lucent top is
A ruby cup,
Wherein no wine is,
Nor pleasures vinous,
But sleep divine is,
That grief drains up.
Like wizened leeches,
The grey moss bleaches
The dark-stemmed beeches,
Wherein there dwell
The high gods, lying,
Cruel, undying,
For ever on couches of asphodel.
O far-off garden !
O weary burden !
Our sere hearts harden
With hopeless fire.
Why in fierce crying
And empty sighing,
Living and dying,
Must strong desire
Waste us for ever,
Till death dissever
Our vain endeavor?
Why must we fret
For hopes ungranted,
Like men enchanted,
Driven by doom they may not forget?
O flame that dieth !
The low wind sigheth
Where none replieth
Save faint, sad moan,
Like ghosts that waken
In woods wind-shaken,
Of longing unslaken
And peace unknown.
O gods that scourge us
With dreams that urge us,
Like storm-swept surges
Where ocean streams
On coasts unknown to us—
Grant this alone to us,
Grant that in death there may be no
dreams !

Jim’s Day Off.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
COCKYING isn't all work, despite the testi-
mony of bards and other liars to' the con-
trary. In slack times, for instance, one
has an occasional Sunday afternoon to himself.
Then in the colder districts, where the season is
too short for growing maize, there is no husking
to be done at night. Once in a while, too, the
‘ ‘ hand ” —most small cockies employ only one
man —gets a whole day off.
“ I’ll be going into town to-morrow, Jim,” the
boss calls out on the eve of some one or other
recognised holiday. “ Have the buggy ready by
nine o’clock. Good-night! ” Then, by way of
an after-thought, “ There’ll be nothing to do once
the separator parts are scalded, so you may take
the day off.”
Jim mutters an inaudible “ Thanks,” and
turns in, undecided as to whether he will spend
the day robbing a certain bees’ nest down by the
creek, or accord his patronage to the Coal Hole
race meeting. Coal Hole is an embryo mining
settlement a few miles distant.
Six a.m. sees Jim at the bail, and the necessary
work is accomplished in little more than half the
usual time. By eight o’clock the cows have been
A BITE.
SUNDOWNER (excitedly , to Bung): “Hey! Mister , give us some whisky, quick: me mate's
been bitten by a snake.”
BUNG (off his guard): “ How much do you want?”
SUNDOWNER (reflectively): “ Better give us a couple of bottles. It was a big snake.”
milked and turned into the lucerne paddock ; the
milk, run through the separator ; horses, calves
and pigs fed ; and the dairy utensils washed and
scoured. After a hasty breakfast the horses are
rubbed down and harnessed, and punctually on
the stroke of nine the buggy stand at the door.
The day off begins. The boss appears with an
armful of rugs, shawls and overcoats.
“ Stand at their heads, Jim. The missus and
kids won’t be long.”
A quarter of an hour passes. The boss enters
the house and re-appears in a few minutes lighting
his pipe. “ They 11 be here in a couple of shakes
now. We’ll be home for tea, Jim. See that the
fire is alight and the kettle boiling. (The servant
girl is spending the day with some relatives at
Coal Hole.) “By the way, I wish you would
take a ride through the top paddock before dinner
and see if there are any sheep there ; we w'ere 10
or 11 short at last week's muster. And if you
are going out at all, see that everything is fixed
up before you leave.”
Jim swears softly, and mentally strikes Coal
Hole off his visiting list for the day. “ Never
mind,” he thinks, “I’ll have a go at that bees’
nest after dinner.”
At a quarter to 10 the missus appears. “ Sorry
to have kept you waiting,” she says, “but I
couldn’t find the children’s overcoats. O, here
they are ” —catching sight of the pile of mercery
on the buggy seat. Turning to Jim—
“ I’ve left some cold fowl in the meat-safe for
your dinner ”
“Want anything from town, Jim?” the boss
interrupts.
“ And please, Jim,” she continues, as that in-
dividual shakes his head negatively, “give the
fowls a dish of pollard before dark. Good-bye ! ”
As the buggy clears the gate, she calls back, “ Be
sure and keep your eye on the house.”
“Damn the house !” Jim exclaims emphati-
cally as he flings the saddle on old Jess.
Two hours’ search in the top paddock fails to
reveal any sign of stragglers, but a broken fence
demands more than passing attention, and it is
one o’clock before he faces the remnant of hen
that has slowly drifted kitchenwards from the
“inside” table.
“ Better wash up the things,” he says aloud,
remembering the bother made on a previous occa-
sion when he had failed to perform that duty.
He fills- the kettle, sweeps out the kitchen, and
pelts a score of turkeys from the garden where
they are vigorously investigating a bed of cauli-
flowers.
The day-off continues. In the two miles of
fencing which encloses the bigpultivation paddock
there is one broken panel, and this the sheep, on
their -way to the dam, have discovered. The
wheat is just high enough to tempt the appetites
of a mob of healthy wethers, and they are busily
engaged sampling the growth. Now, according
to school-books, the sheep is a patient, docile
animal, and calls for reciprocal patience and
docility on the part of those who have to do with
him. Likewise he is obstinate, and his vision is
at times distorted. Thus an opening in a fence,
when viewed from the outside, is magnified many
thousands of diameters, whilst the same opening,
viewed from the inside, decreases in size according
to his nearness to it; when directly in the line of
his vision it ceases to exist. Jim realises this fact
long before the last of the mob disappears through
the broken panel. He patches up the break with
some scraps of fencing wire and returns to the
house.
There he remembers certain instructions re-
garding the filling of an empty chaff-bin, and
carrying a couple of bags from the hay-shed,
empties them into it. A week's accumulation of
manure in a corner of the stable catches his eye,
and knowing there will be little time for such
work to-morrow, he sweeps out the stalls and
wheels the litter on to the dung-heap. The
kitchen wood-box next demands attention. Three
or four armfuls of stove-lengths satisfy its void, and
some longer logs are piled up at the back door for
the “ inside ” fire.
By now it is time to do the “ necessary ” work.
The fowls are given their pollard ; the cows are
driven from the lucerne, watered at the dam, and
turned into the front paddock for the night ; the
horses, calves and pigs are fed. Then Jim sits
down to await the coming of the family.
At seven o’clock he has his tea. This
finished and the table cleared, he gathers amuse-
ment and knowledge from a much-thumbed maga-
zine, until the rattle of the buggy arouses him to a
sense of duty and he wanders stablewards to
attend to the sweating horses.
Later that night Mr. Conditional Purchase
remarks to his wife; “I can't make Jim out.
When he does get a day off he mopes around the
house all the time, doing nothing—never seems to
care about going away to race meetings like other
young fellows. I think he must be getting lazy.
VELDT.
The One-Drink Racket.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BILL GREEN, coming up from the crossing
with a short team and a red-and-
white dray, turned the matter over in his
mind. As he came to the parting of the ways he
decided, and yelled to the horses, which came in
on the track leading to McCrystal’s.
“One won’t ’urt me,” murmured Bill, breast-
ing the gully-side with a dry tongue at his lips.
It was nine o’clock o’ the morning, and Bill had
turned out at six. He had just left the Com-
pany’s store with orders to find another Bill, who
was Bill Brown, burning charcoal somewhere
back of the Treasure Trove.
“One won’t ’urt me,” he agreed with himself,
in a glow of thirsty anticipation, and bumped
A CUT FROM THE LOIN.
“ You're no gentleman!"
“ Gain! V’ Adams spare rib!”
along to the front of the pub. Three horses
were hung up there, and their owners were inside.
They knew Bill —the owners, that is—and hailed
him joyously.
“Well, one won’t ’urt me, Jim! ” said Bill.
They had one.
“ I always makes a point uv ’avin’ just one in
th’ morn’,” said Bill, as the beer trickled. One
wouldn’t ’urt anybody. More’s bad fer yer work.
’Owever, we might’s well, seein’ it’s ”
They had another. _
“ I got t’ go out’ th’ Trove,” said Bill. “ No,
one drink’s a fair thing in th’ morn’. But
well, this’ll be th’ last, enny’ow. I got t’ earn
me livin’ !”
Then there was yet another, and a fourth fol-
lowed the third.
At dinner-time the bell rang, after the usual
manner. Bill lifted his moustache out of his beer.
“ Woh ?” he said. “Woh’s’at? Din’? Mush
be movin’ along ! ”
He went out, and took his patient horses down
to the creek and watered them.
Shortly he came back to the pub for his dinner,
leaving the horses outside as before. (There was
no room for them inside.) On his way to the
dining-room he passed the inner side-door.
“No !” said Bill. “You shaps go' no work-
ado ! Well—or-ri’ ! One won’ ’urt me ! Goo-
luck ! ”
After lunch Bill was firm.
“ Gorrago t’ work,” he protested, and they all
went to have just one last drink.
At five o’clock the sound of the company’s
knock-off whistle came up from the sawmill on
the flat, and Bill left his mates and made off for
the crossing.
The yard for the company's teams was opposite
the store. Bill drew up at the panels and started
in to put up his horses. When the team was
stripped, the rails of the fence carried a tangle of
hames and collars and trace-chains that would
have broken the heart of the horse-boss had that
gentleman been on the spot instead of 30 miles
down the Coast-road. The harness tangle was
made up entirely from the gear off Bill's horses.
Crathers, the surface foreman, arrived just as
Bill was leaving the yard.
“Did y’ get the char”—? Plis glance wan-
dered to the fence.
“ Come in th’ office, Green ! ” he growled in a
terrible voice.
Green sighed the sigh of one who has had all
the good things he can reasonably expect. He
straightened himself and took a pull on his gait.
“ O, well,” he said, “I sh’pose one won’—
won’ ’urt me ! ” and he lurched after Crathers.
“ Get it in th’ mornin’ ! ” said Crathers, hand-
ing him a slip of paper.
Bill took the slip and stared at it for a moment,
uncomprehending. Then he waved it in Crathers’
face, and rolled out of the store shack.
“Ur!” he jeered. “’Oo cares for th'—th’
bul - bo-boo—th’ bloo’n’ bullet!” and sloped for
the crossing once more, with a broad grin upon
his large, hairy face. Up the gully-side he strode,
with assorted stridings, great and small, more or
less in the direction of McCrystal’s.
As he strode, he murmured to himself, happily,
“ Well—well-we-well ! One wo-won’t ’urt me !”
and presendy joined the glad, idle throng against
the bar.

THE PIAZZA.
Mark Foy’s New Premises, Liverpool, Castlereagh and Elizabeth Streets, Sydney.
A CRITICAL APPRECIATION
By H. W. LITTLE.
[. Reprinted from The Magnet, October , iQOcf.
T is fair to assume that no building yet
erected in Australia has received more
criticism than Mark Foy’s new premises.
So soon as the structure commenced
to give signs of its exterior shape, the
critics at once remarked, “ What an extraordin-
ary building!'’
Apparently the critic of the common order had
expected that Mark Foy’s would adopt the usual
architecture peculiar to a big store, ignorant of
the fact that Mark Foy’s are original in all their
methods. For example, they have never held a
“winter” or “summer” sale, for a big sale is
conducted daily. A fair is held twice yearly, and
it marks a profitable epoch in very many house-
holds. Now the main purpose of any building,
be it cathedral, humpy, store or house, is utility.
If designed by an architect who is also an artist,
he will make his structure picturesque.
Observe the exterior of Mark I'oys—white
glazed brick relieved with bands of yellow. White
glazed tiles are very common, but they are apt to
fall out of place.
The white glazed bricks were imported from the
Shaw’s Rigg Company of Glasgow, and the yellow
faience brick-work was obtained from Permatoff,
of Yorkshire. This brickwork is of great piactical
utility. With the aid of water and a brush it is
easy to keep clean. Indeed, every heavy shower
of rain effects that. To-day, the “ Clerk of the
Weather” is Mark Foy’s charwoman.
In every detail the structure is original. Had
it been designed by the ordinary mechanical archi-
tect, the frontage facing Liverpool Street would
be the mere series of garish windows usual with
shops built on a slight incline.
The front, thanks to the brain of its creator, is
most impressive and unique. Approached by a
sweeping flight of slate steps, with a plain but
effective balustrade at the Castlereagh Street end,
one does not require to be a prophet to state that
“ Mark Foy’s steps ” will quickly become famous.
We shall frequently read in the “personal
column,” “Meet me at Mark Foy’s steps,” or
“Meet me at the Piazza.”
The spacious and lofty verandah facing Liver-
pool Street may fairly be described as perfection
in the architectural sense. Constructed of steel,
and fitted with “armoured” plate glass, this
verandah, or awning, is held in position, not by
posts, but by gilded steel cables attached to the
outside walls." I observe, too, that since this
verandah was erected its mode of construction has
been adopted by other firms in town, much to the
ornamentation of their premises. The pavement
at the top of the steps is fitted with the glass pave-
ment lights, so general, because so valuable, in-
London.
That portion of the building facing Liverpool
Street has one storey only, but that part facing
Castlereagh Street contains a double storey. This
isowing to the “fall” of the ground between
Elizabeth and Castlereagh Street,
The four towers at the corner of the building
give dignity. The design savors of the Jfrench.
The structure is more like a palace than;a store,
and “ once seen will never be forgotten.
This fine palace of trade is well named “ The
Piazza;"’.' Let the visitor try and count its endless
rows of graceful composite pillars, richly gilt and
relieved with cool, soft and pleasing colors. It is
an ideal place for people to meet and walk about
and see and admire at their leisure. The interior
is charming, chiefly on account of that necessary
item—light. It is no vain boast to remark that
there is not a building in Australia so well pro-
vided with light as Mark Toy’s.
Here the designer and architects have given
much light. They have ignored the common
mode of roof, and used slate for that portion that
is visible, and for the major portion (invisible),
glass. Light is (or should be) an absolute neces-
sity for all drapers. It is a common sight to
observe a shop assistant outside his employer s
establishment exhibiting to a lady customer cer-
tain, dress materials with the object of letting the
ladv see them by natural light. That sort of
thing’ will never be necessary outside “The
Piazza,” for here there is light in abundance. To
me the building appears to have been designed
with two objects only—viz., (i) The comfort of
the customer, and (2) to make work easy for the
assistant. Happy is the assistant who is em-
ployed at Mark Toy's. A customer makes a
purchase (a not uncommon event at Mark Toy’s) ;
it is wrapped in a parcel in the presence of the
customer \ it is then placed on a spiral chute,
thence it slides down to a travelling conveyor,
which runs it straight to the Parcels Office. Here
the parcel is checked and entered, then placed on
a second travelling conveyor, by which it goes to
the Despatch Room.
Observe the floor-space at “ The Piazza ; it
is of huge dimensions. There is plenty of room
for ladies to walk about and display the graceful
draperies worn by the sex. All the appointments
are of unusual excellence. Note, too, the many
handsome counters in charge of polite attendants.
These stands are all in harmony with their sur-
roundings, and heaped with rare and beautiful
goods of every description.
The refreshment rooms are sure to meet with
great popular favor. No indigestible pastry, with
“husband's tea,” but luncheon of a high class,
also light refreshments, and all at most modest
cost.
The ceilings of “ The Piazza” deserve special
notice, on account of their unusual boldness and
beauty. They were manufactured by the Wunder-
lich Co., at Redfern, from the best British sheet
steel. In the three floors, including the dome,
are 160,000 square yards of metal, while 35,000
feet “extra” went to the cornices on the walls
and girders. The first and second floors are
treated in richly-embossed panels, which were all
specially designed for the particular lay, so that
the effect produced is well worthy the attention of
artistic folk. It was the largest contract ever
undertaken by the company.
The artist who was responsible for the decora-
tive scheme (Mr. H. J. Crisp, of Sydney) has
done his work most admirably, while the tieat-
ment of the ceilings, representing old Indian
Ivory, is truly grand. It would be difficult to
discover any building with more beautiful ceilings
than Sydney’s latest palace of trade.
The space under the dome, which, by the way,
, is of glass with ribs of steel, is occupied by a
handsome octagonal staircase, with rich cedar
stairway, and wrought iron and hammered coppei
balustrades. The treatment of this striking stair-
case is much after the mode of the days of Louis
XIV., when gay courtiers crowded the noble
stairways at Versailles.
Now, as a rule, shopping is apt to make people
somewhat weary, but that, I should say, will
never be the case at Mark Foy’s. There shopping
should be a real pleasure. A well-furnished read-
ing and writing room is provided with plenty of
books and magazines, writing materials, postcards,
etc. If they desire them, visitors may obtain
books from the .well-supplied circulating library
of 33,000 vols. After writing their letters, cus-
tomers can post them at a Pillar Post, cleared at
regular hours by the officials of the G.P.O.
Stamps, etc., can be purchased at the news-stall.
“The Piazza” contains many novelties and
items quite new to Australia. I doubt whether
six other firms in the world have in daily use
travelling staircases and conveyors. The stair-
case at “ The Piazza ” is a French invention, and
is quite the most delightful and popular thing in
the city. It was imported from Paris. The
specifications for its erection were in French, and
various engineers were asked to place the travel-
ling staircase in position, but they could not do it,
Mr. Foy decided to bring over skilled mechanics
from France, but the Standard Waygood Com-
pany, then engaged in erecting the lifts, etc.,
found a young Australian engineer in their em-
ployment who thought he could do the job. Pie had
observed the failures to make the staircase move,
and approached Mr. Foy, suggesting that he (Mr.
Gordon Bennett) might he allowed to try. Mr.
Foy, who is a mighty keen judge of character,
and knows at once if a man is, or is not, fitted
for important work, placed the work in charge of
Mr. Bennett, who set to and mastered the many
intricate parts of the staircase, with the result that
this really wonderful invention daily delights and
serves thousands of people. The operation is
simplicity itself; the visitor steps on to the stair,
and without moving the feet again, is conveyed to
the first floor as if bv magic.
Should these staircases ever become general in
private houses, it will be quite a treat for tired
mothers to carry the baby to the fourth floor.
The only thing against their general adoption
is the expense. I believe Mr. Foy paid thousands
for his travelling staircase. The difficult job of
erecting the wonderful staircase has produced one
excellent result, seeing it has proved Mr. Gordon
Bennett to be a mechanical engineer of the first
order. His services are sure to be in demanu,
and his future prospects are bright. His life is a
model for young ■ Australian's,; a lesson to. them
not to waste time in reading trash, or devoting all
their spare time to sport, but to, take a keen in-
terest in their work, and neglect no opportunity of
improving their minds. With such a text, I can t
help sermonising a bit. In its way Mr. Bennett s
job is a triumph for us all in Australia. liis
acquaintance with French before he tackled the
job was next to nil, while the job itself was abso-
lutely unlike anything else in Australia. All the
appointments are handsome and repiesent the
best and latest ideas. These appointments will
admit of critical inspection. They will prove of
value as an object-lesson to Australian artisans
who may be interested in shop fittings. In fact,
in the whole building Mr. Foy has provided a
dozen different trades with magnificent' models
for imitation and emulation. “The Piazza,” as
an educative factor, must have great influence on
future Australian building and architecture.
Some people consider that the building lacks
height, forgetful of the fact that it is a piazza,
not a warehouse. Practical experience shows
that shoppers do not approve of buildings with
great height. What they prefer is much floor
space ; hence I maintain that “ The Piazza is
the proper height for its purpose. The architects,
Messrs. M‘Credie and Anderson, are apparently
of my opinion. They have recognised the wisdom
of due proportion.
Space in The Magnet is limited, hence it is
not possible in one short article to recount the
many wonders of “ The Piazza. But no article
could be complete without reference to the hun-
dreds of huge mirrors, not only in the windows,
but all through the building. A lady recently
remarked to the writer, “ I like Mark hoy’s
mirrors ; they are quite unlike the ordinary
mirrors that give a false reflection.” I quite
agreed with her. These beautiful mirrors are not
placed in position haphazard, but each is so
arranged that its reflection is conveyed to another
portion of the building. Perhaps there is a
reason, but that is another story.
The erection of “ The Piazza ” has been a costly
and very difficult undertaking, but this is not the
place to recite the list of things that had to be
done and of difficulties that had to be overcome.
Brains and perseverance surmounted all difficulties
as they always will ! It would be hard to over-
estimate the skill of the contractors, Messrs.
Douzans Brothers. The contract was exception-
ally costly, and exceptionally difficult. Thousands
of tons of earth had to be removed before it was
possible even to make a start ! Messrs. Douzans
Brothers had, indeed, work of unusual magnitude
and unusual innovation ; but they accomplished
it, and without accidents, to the great satisfaction
of all concerned. .
No building in Australia has been erected with
greater preliminary care than was “ The Piazza.
In company with Mr. hoy, one of the architects
(Mr. Anderson) visited Europe and England, and
then went to America. On returning to Sydney,
he took charge of the erection of the building.
Mark Fov’s is not a copy of other buildings,
but in its'main treatment is strictly original.
Certain details may have been taken from other
buildings, but I think all the details of con-
struction and appointments are new to Australia.
From henceforth, no visitor will be able to say
“I have seen Sydney” unless or he she—and
particularly she —has visited Mark P oy s.

LOCAL versus FOREIGN FOR AUSTRALIANS.
Dear Fellow Australians, —Have you smoked Australian Tobacco? If not, you
should do so at once. Remember that it is by other Australians supporting you that you
are able to do so well in Australia ; therefore we ask you as Australians to smoke our
REFEREE Tobacco, which is grown in Australia by Australians, and then manufactured
by Australian White Labor, for the owners, who are all Australians born and bred. We
know you have plenty of patriotism and national pride, and that it only requires for us to
mention it, and you will at once make a resolution to smoke only Australian Tobacco.
Do not be misled by the glow and glamor of foreign tobaccos, but stand firm and solid
for Australian principles by smoking REFEREE, in Tin or Plug, the only genuine and
purely Australian Brand to be bought in Australia. Remember that every penny of vour
money ispent in smoking Referee Tobacco remains in Australia for ever ; not one cent goes
to foreign lands. Also remember that for ioo years now Australians have been smoking
foreign tobacco, thereby enriching a few importer princes of Australia, and through them
foreign millionaires ; so don’t you think it a fair thing now that Australian manufacturers
should have a share of your support ? We are sure you will sav yes ; and in acting up to
this resolution make dead certain that you get Referee, the only absolute Australian brand
of tobacco to be got in Australia, and take no other.
Thanking you in anticipation of your support,
We are, Dear Australians, Your Fellow-Countrymen,
S. BURT & COMPANY,
Manufacturers of REFEREE Local Tobacco. TIN and PLUG, Gd. each.

HOW to SECURE GOOD. HEALTHY HAIR
30 Years’ Study.
Do not put your head under the tap every day. If you
do, you will soon have a polished head. Do not trust to
shaving of the head to bring back your hair after fever. If
you do, you will be grievously disappointed. Do not use
every quack nostrum advertised when your hair begins to
drop out. If vou do, it will only fall out more quickly.
See Government Report on the composition of imported
hair washes. One is composed of borax water and scent ;
another glycerine and water ; and the third scented kerosene.
THE PREPARATIONS I SUPPLY for the pre-
servation, color and growth of the hair are the result of 30
years of assiduous study of the hair and its treatment. Ihe
manufacturers of many of the borax-and-water preparations
do not possess even an elementary knowledge of the hair,
whereas I have given it a life-long study.
This ought to give you confidence in consulting me.
MY PREPARATIONS ARE NOT INFALLIBLE,
but if they are used for a reasonable time, in most cases
they work wonders, as thousands of my patients testify in
letters now in my possession.
If your hair is not giving you satisfaction, write me
about it, and I will prescribe for it gladly. IDO NOT
MAKE ONE GENERAL CURE-ALL, but I have
different preparations for different diseases of the scalp and
hair. What would be beneficial in one case would be
disastrous in another. Write and tell me all about it when
it commences to fall out, whether the scalp is dry or gieasy,
and the state of your constitution.
With these particulars as a guide I could put you in
possession of such information and treatment as would in
ninety-nine cases out of one hundred help you to get rid of
any scalp trouble, and to preserve and produce a good
growth of hair.
To do this it is absolutely essential that the treatment
should be continued for six or eight months at the least. If
you are not prepared to do this, I would much rather that
,rr.n rlirl not commence with rnv treatment.

WHAT IS CATARRH?
Catarrh is inflamination of the lining:
membrane of the nose and adjoining:
passages. If this inflammation is not ar-
rested it invades tlie passages which lead
from the nose to the head, ears, throat and
lungs. It injures the sight and hearing,
destroys the sense of taste and smell, ren-
ders the breath offensive, breaks down
the affected tissues, and consumes the
nas.l cartilages. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and stomach, causes
dyspepsia, also consumption. Do you
want relief and cure? If so, try our
great remedy.
