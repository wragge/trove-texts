SATURDAY. AUGUST 28. 1880.
A Herring across the Track.
■\Ye can confidently appeal to our readers to bear
us out in the claims we make of baying opposed
on every occasion since we have been before the
public the progress of that miserable sectarian spirit
which so much is now being done to nourish and
propagate in Sydney. While on the one hand
we have not been sparing of unlicensed free-
thought in its more repulsive phases, we have
always strongly deprecated any concession to the
bitterness of the sects. We therefore feel the
more justified in calling public attention to a
circumstance which from its nature and the
position of the person concerned is calculated to
cause a great deal of mischief in this direction.
We will, of course, be understood to allude to
the very reprehensible attempt made by Sir
Henbt Parkes at St. Paul’s College the other
evening, when he attended the banquet given
to the Bishop of Newcastle—a decided acquisi-
tion to the colony —to institute an invid ; ~.^t ni
comparison between the two larger religious
nominations of New South Wales. Now we
have no desire to move our readers to incredulous
laughter by professing any decided preference
for any ecclesiastical hierarchy. But when, on
an occasion of the kind referred to, and when
remarks of the nature in question were so pecu-
liarly uncouth and out of place, a politician
openly stigmatises the “policy” of a rival church
as “tending to encourage the extinction of the in-
tellect,” the fact naturally sets one prospecting
forthwith for motives, which are, indeed, not
rery hard to discover. To us, as to any unpreju-
diced observer, the motives of the action in this
instance are clearly traceable to a desire
to arouse the theological zeal of the
one Church against the other, so that,
distracted by their petty differences no
combined move may take place during the
elections in relation to the false issue which,
with characteristic obliquity of political
principles, has been placed before the country.
This, and a not unnatural desire to gall the dog-
matical prelate who, with more vigour and ability,
perhaps, than apparent Christian charity lately
criticised the principles of his action, have led
the Premier to the commission of something not
far short of a serious political misdemeanour—for
such we consider this act which tends so palpably
to pander to Sectarian discord. We do not arraign
trir Henry in this matter on a question of good
taste, because we think his intellectual calibre
holds more of the mushroom “ culchaw,” properly
so called, than of true mental cultivation in its
highest sense; and while on this subject we
hasten to express a hope that the gentle and
courtly, but cutting rebuke of the right reverend
guest was not entirely lost when he so happily
alluded to his long connection with an institution
abundantly trammelled with those venerable
traditions,” of which the Premier spoke so
rhghtingly. Our objection to the remarks in
question is based on broader and more solid
grounds,—it is in the interests of enlightened
itatesmanship, and we may add, of good citizen-
hhat we deprecate such a narrow-minded
appeal. We think that any party triumph,
uouever acceptable to the electors at large and
cneficial in its results, is dearly purchased at
® expense, even in a small degree, of that
Pa notic fellowship and mutual goodwill that
'Quid exist between the religious denominations
] ch meet on an equal footing on the shores of
niB young country.
Truth and Fiction.
miir ENCE Caches UB >” says Mr. Proctor, “that
bp fi' 0118 ,o*' 0 *' 7 eai ’ 8 before the earth was fitted to'
, hfe, our companion planet, the
a * s ntm desolate, must have been in
siatin' f 6 ( c ( onc btion.” And the audience, con-
-8e: £ °* “ moB k potent, grave and reverend
meters’ s ® ur Ter 7 n ° ble a nd approved good
endm. ’,l smelly _ applaud the sentiment and
redan S-6 le lrres istiblo truth of the facts and
ning upon which it is based. Yet we are
all of us taxed to support a State religion which,
through State schools, books and teachers, informs
the plastic mind of childhood that God made
the dry land of the earth on the third day of
creation and clothed it with grass, herbs and
fruit; and on the following day made the moon.
All this is taught by the will and at the expense
of a secular State; and at the same time, in ac-
cordance with the dictates of secular morality,
an effort is made to induce the children to
discern that it is wrong to tell lies. As the chil-
dren grbw up and find that their own fathers
and teachers do not believe what the State
schools have solemnly inculcated, what must be
the confusion in their minds ! How can we be
assured that they will let go only what is value-
less in what they have been taught and cling to
the social virtues which are priceless P Have we
any right to drag them through the fire of such
a terrible ordeal ? Are they not entitled to the
purest pearls of knowledge which we can give
them, instead of receiving the husks of outworn
superstitions ? If the sects will insist on thrust-
ing these husks before the young, let it be done,
as in the other colonies, at their own proper cost.
Our neighbour colonies and New Zealand have
no State-supported theology. They content
themselves with furnish . their young with a
good secular education to -it them for the battle
of life, and teach them nothing in childhood
which they have laboriously to unlearn in after
years, and from which their fathers are emanci-
pated. If sectarianism insists on their being
instructed that the moon was made on the fourth
day and the fruits of the earth on the third,
sectarianism has to do it. Why should New
South Wales stand alone, a spectacle among the
Australian colonies, with the old sacerdotal cap
of duncedom upon its head ? What does it
want more than they with a State religion, in
which it proves its disbelief as soon as a mes-
senger of Science uplifts his voice within its
halls?
The World in Bloom.
It must be satisfactory to find, on the authority
of so reliable an informant as the great astronomer,
Peoctob, that the planet we inhabit is just now
in the perfection of its “life,” but is sure here-
after to form one of the many old skeleton worlds
that are scattered through space. As the earth
will soon reach its grand climacteric, it would
not be an unreasonable thing to look out for the
millennium, if the human race will ever be
blessed with such a period of repose. As a
preliminary, if wars ceased—if political crises
were for ever at an end —if gaol-birds had dis-
appeared from all the aviaries erected for their
accommodation, and neither Permissive Liquor
Laws nor Divorce Courts were needed —we should
begin to think that our world was not only in
the perfection of its physical beauty, but of its
moral bloom. Pity ’tis that this pleasing possi-
bility will not be realised in our generation. Mr.
Pboctob is himself a type of the intellectual
progress of his age. He gives us glimpses of the
stellar creation, which are even grander than the
poet Young’s whose— '
One star by day : by night ten thousand shine
To light us deep into the Deity,
cannot raise the same amount of enlightened
wonder as the plain version of what “the heavens
are telling” as given to us by Mr. Proctor
every evening. It would, indeed, betray a
singular want of intelligence on the part of the
community if they did not receive such an
interpreter of natural phenomena with enthu-
siasm and gratitude. Australia can boast of
more than one native-born astronomer; the
names of Russell and Tebbutt are known in
all civilised countries; it is not, therefore,
surprising that we should significantly welcome
a greater master of the science when he comes
amongst us, particularly as his hints give us
hopes of the intelligent and meral progress of
mankind.
Retrenchment.
The time is at hand when candidates for the
Legislative Assembly commence fulminating their
theories, and in view of past lavish expenditure
in certain directions, a falling land revenue and a
bad season, finance will of necessity be a leading
topic. It is unfortunate that nearly every legiti-
mate and sensible mode of raising revenue by
means of new or additional taxation has been
tabooed, and consequently the only resource left
to mediocrity is the delusive and mischievous
cry of retrenchment. Economy in Government
expenditure is both proper and necessary at all
times, but spasmodic efforts to make ends meet
by arbitrarily cutting down the pay of employees
of the Government is greatly to be deprecated.
It has been truly observed that men utterly
destitute of constructive ability have built up for
themselves reputations which have led to their
acquiring high positions with large emoluments
by stubbornly resisting, without consideration of
their merits, proposals to increase the salaries of
deserving and able public officers. The effect of
this conduct has been at times virtually to take
the heart out of the service,.and instead of leading
to economy has had the opposite effect. The first
principle of economy in regard to the Civil
Service is to secure a good and efficient organi-
sation, which can only be effected by reposing
confidence in responsible officers, and giving them
assurance that they will not be liable to have
their domestic arrangements thrown into con-
fusion by capricious and sudden curtailment of
their salaries, which it may be fairly assumed
have been granted with due regard to the im-
portance of the duties entrusted to them. Many
years ago the head of a Government which had a
long tenure of office adopted a system of so-
called retrenchment which had a very bad effect.
It was thus. When an office fell vacant, say of
£lOO a year, instead of promotion being conferred
upon the next in seniority, the £-100 was split
up into four billets of £lOO each —the appointees
being of course nominated by some political
friends. In due course the new men grew in
wisdom and stature. The cry for retrench-
ment having subsided, increases were granted,
and the natural result followed that instead of
having one good officer with an adequate salary,
there were two or three in excess of the number
required, a a cost in the aggregate much greater
than would have resulted from the more sensible
course of promoting. Every Ministry in its
turn has been charged with making unnecessary
appointments, and in the instance just cited and
in others it was undoubtedly too true ; but if we
may judge by the announcement in the Govern-
ment Gazette, the present Government have
not, for some time past at all events, had much
to answer for in this direction. It is to be
hoped that when they come to consider the Es-
timates for next year they will find a more
rational way of meeting the financial difficulty—
if one should exist—than that of inflicting an
inordinate tax upon a class of people whose voice
cannot be raised in their own defence, and who,
for this very reason, naturally look to the Gov-
ernment for protection.
The Hon. Francis Bathurst Suttor.
Postmaster-General.
There is in the world of Literature, Art and
Politics an ambition which —to use the magnifi-
cent language of Dr. Samuel Johnson—is “the
noble soul’s distinguishing perfection.” All men
do not consecrate their lives to the realisation of
an ideal unless they are moved thereto by some-
thing higher than the gratification of personal
vanity and the acquisition of something more
valuable than mere money. The subtle influences
that lead a young man to devote himself to any
high pursuit are not to be considered lightly or
formulated with too quick a hand. Young as the
colony of New South Wales is as a State, she has
been distinguished by the virtues and pluck of
many of her sons ; and although her more notable
exhibitions of energy may have been made
in athletic or in pastoral pursuits, it cannot

date for the representation of the electorate of Newtowu,
in thejnew Parliament. Your appreciation of my con-
duct in the various offices I have had the honor to fill is

have presented me with. I regret that I cannot accede
to your request, as I cannot afford the time necessary
to the faithful discharge of the high and important
duties which will devolve upon the proper representa-
tion of your important electorate. I hope, at some
future time, to be able to place my humble services at
your disposal. Again thanking you for your good
opinions, and sincerely hoping that I may continue to
merit the same,
I am, Gentlemen, yours obediently,

be denied that she is otherwise distinguished. The
indomitable will* of a Wentworth; the critical
genius of a Deniohy—keen and bright as a blade
of Damascus —the many-sided mind of a Hal-
loran; and the creative power of a Kendall (to
omit many other illumined names) — do
honour to any country. In the region of politics
distinguished men have been still more numerous
amongst us ; and although we cannot look on these
latter with the same pure and reverential regard
as we do on the individuals we have named, or on
the Brothers Harpur, who, though they were in
some sense politicians, exhibited »their greatest
gifts of mind in directions purely literary, these
traditions of. the country’s fame cannot be too
carefully guarded or too fully transmitted to pos-
terity. The ambition that is pure—the ambition
that is inspired by love of country, and to serve
one’s generation —should be looked upon as a
life-bloom of beauty and fragrance, and not as the
mere or mean outcome of an inordinate vanity or
the desire of securing social distinction and pecu-
niary reward. The family of Suttor have been
long distinguished in the colony for their inde-
pendence of character and practical common
sense. Its native-born members have uniformly
shown a living love for the land of their birth, co-
operating in all projects for her advancement —
socially, intellectually and politically. It was
a Suttor that associated the scientific labours
of Sir Joseph Banks with the colony by pub-
lishing a sketch of that great botanist’s life, which
was circulated gratuitously about half-a-century
ago. The career of William Henry Suttor, the
elder, is too well known to require more than a
passing notice. He was a sturdy representative
of the colony for Roxburgh, Wellington and
Phillip, in the old Legislative Council, and after-
wards (in 1856) was returned to the Legislative
Assembly, under the Constitution Act, as member
for Bathurst. His son, William Henry, the
younger, born at Brucedale, near Bathurst, in
1834, made a highly creditable reputation as a man
of sound sense, punctilious integrity, and good
administrative abilities. During his tenure of
office, as Minister for Mines in the Farnell
Administration, with which he went out in 1878,
he did the country good service, but retired from
the more active duties of a politician afterwards
as if disgusted with the caprices of parties in the
Assembly. The early pursuits of the subject of
this memoir—an enlightened and successful
squatter—led many to suppose that he would not
make politics one of the serious studies of his life ;
but he has, nevertheless, in latter years so identi-
fied himself with the advanced Liberal party, or
it may be has yielded so unreservedly to the in-
fluences of Sir Henry Parkes, that he may be
looked upon equally as a man of the present times
and a man of the future. He has already been the
chief of two bureaus, and in both must have
fully satisfied his colleagues, as they sacrificed a
tried public servant, Mr. T. M. Slattery, sooner
than offend Mr. Suttor’ s' amour propre. It is
useless to discuss this matter now ; the Minister
was offended at the persistence of the subordinate,
and the latter was dismissed because he did not
know how to yield. Mr. Suttor is yet a compara-
tively young man, being only in the forty-first
year of his age. He was born at Bathurst
in 1839, and educated at the King’s School
Parramatta, where he was associated with
many young gentlemen —alumni of whom
that School may well be proud—who have
since distinguished themselves in many ways and
done good service to the colony. As Minister of
Justice and Education, Mr. F. B. Suttor had good
opportunities of making himself acquainted with
the educational requirements of the colony, and if
he modified his early denominational views, on his
taking office, we believe he was actuated by an
honest change of opinion. He is not the type of
a public man who would sacrifice conscientious
convictions to subserve personal interests or party
expedients. He is now Postmaster-General of his
native land, and has already infused considerable
animation into the department. He is not a
showy speaker, but he embodies his views in
clear and often energetic language. His high
personal character, his amiability, and phil-
anthropic tendencies endear him to all who have
the pleasure of enjoying his friendship. We only
estimate him in his public capacity; and we should
certainly do discredit to our impressions if we
concealed or ignored our high estimate of the
honorable gentleman’s worth. The engraving is
taken from a fine portrait by Freeman.


TOWN TALK.
It was the other day said by the correspondent of
a Sydney paper that Mr. T. N. Fitzgerald, of
Melbourne (it is refreshing to hear a distinguished
medical man called plain “ Mr. ’ in face of the fact
that every qualified quack is here dubbed Dr. ),
is. “ the best surgeon on this side of the equator.
-Wow as Mr. Fitzgerald loves for its own sake the
nrofession of which he is so brilliant an ornament,
and is a man who objects to that advertising sys-
tem which in Now South Wales and Victoria alike
lias done so much to bring surgery down to the
level of bootmaking, his friends, especially in view
of the fact that we have one or two very clover
surgeons in Sydnev, will excuse us from making
invidious comparisons. It has been truly ( said
that to bo successful a surgeon must have the
eve of an eagle, the hand of a lady, and the heart
of a lion.” Mr. Fitzgerald has all these. His
manual dexterity is the wonder of his professional
brethren ; there is no more clever practical anato-
mist and ho is as much “at home” in the most
difficult of the capital operations as in snipping
off a crushed toe. Better than all, he is an
honorary surgeon of the Melbourne hospital, and
he and his wife, the most charming of Tasmania s
daughters, are among the best friends of the sick
poor Mr. Fitzgerald is recovering from the
effects of his recent severe accident. We are
glad to hear it. Good surgeons are scarce, and
their value beyond all money. To lose Mr. Fitz-
gerald would bo a national calamity.
Relatively speaking, the Press of New South
Wales is shackled and enslaved. Let any intelli-
gent reader peruse the “ Topics of the Week in
the Australasian of August 21st and he will at
once admit, if he possesses any knowledge of the
manner in which the Übel law is administered
here, that our assertion is proved. It is refreshing
to read the vigorous, slashing comments of the
great all-round weekly after turning from the
milk-and-water platitudes to which the journalists
of this colony are often confined, even when
-writing on strictly public questions, by sheer
dread of the libel-law. We specially invite atten-
tion to the second paragraph under the heading
named in illustration of our remarks. There are
printed in last week’s Australasian at least a
dozen things which any New South Wales editor
who knew his business would not dare to print.
Like Orlando in the forest, Labby has been on
the mountains, “ chewing the food of sweet and
bitter fancy.” Alas! on his return Labby will
look in vain for the venerable rat-invested, but
aeauestered nook in the Commissariat Buildings
where he used to transact all that overpowenngly
important and exhausting work of paying Imperial
Pensioners their periodical doles—a work which
can never cease, for pensioners never die. Why
oh. why did Egerius,—" feeding fat the ancient
grudge he bore him”—lay that cruel trap for his
friend on first watching him well away from his
not importunate although immortal pensioners,
and then, when well assured that he was over
the hills and far away,” sending again and again
to his office for the happy truant? Was this the
right way of showing gratitude for the graceful
condescension which Labby bestowed on Egerius
some few months ago, when Sir Joseph Porter
K C B ” requiring for certain official purposes a
resplendent Cocked Hat of the true Windsor
pattern; beamingly asked Egenus to lend him
his ! and was horrified by the tone and the terms
in which the delicate request wasjj^used. But
(as Burke wrote and Labby has ,ound out)
‘‘ the age of Chivalry is gone,” and the Imperial
almoner will now have to dispense the Imperial
bounty to the Imperial Pensioners in some pokey
place behind the Treasury, and beneath the eye of
Egerius, like a fifth-class receiving clerk at the
Railway Station !! Let us hope that the indignant
pavmaster will not retort by placing himself at the
head of a troop of Immortals, seigmg Egerius and
his Chief, throwing them into the Commissariat
Dungeons, or into the Tower of Governnient House,
and then, after confiscating the remainder of the
Surplus, a few thousand Debentures, and Egenus
uniform, issue cards for a grand performance of
«'pinafore’ ’ in the Palace of the Colonial Secretary!
The average clerical journalist of Sydney is
a miserable specimen of humanity. He pos-
sesses as much Christian charity as does a
gorilla. In Victoria it is the political madman
who makes the trouble ; in our (in this respect)
less favoured country it is the religious monoma-
niac Here is what a writer in the Express of
7th inst. says of poor Henry Corbyn :
H. W. Corhyn, a drunken gambler, committed sui-
cide this day week at the Oxford Hotel.
This is Christian charity with a vengeance. Not
only was no evidence in regard to the deceased
having gambled submitted at the inquest, but it
has never even been rumoured among the members
of the theatrical profession that Corbyn was ad-
dicted to play. The unfortunate fellow’s health
had been broken by fever in India, and disappoint-
ment met him here. Perhaps he drank to excess,
and perhaps, too, the flowing bowl in which many
a good man and true has tried to drown his cares
was the indirect cause of his going to his long
home. But now that he is dead we can surely
afford to let his body rest. He lies, poor fellow,
in a nameless grave, and he died without money
and without friends. It is well for the Express
that Henry Corbyn’s brother, now in California, is
not in Sydney. But had he been hero—had it been
known that a single friend or kinsman was ready
to warn the birds of carrion from his mortal re-
mains—then perhaps would the dead body of
Henry W. Corbyn have been unmolested by eccle-
siastical crows.
"The Turn of the Tide."
Tub piece which the London Comedy Company
are now playing at the Hoyal is admitted be
the best mounted drama yet shown in this city,
and altogether certainly not the least interesting
of those this brilliant company have given us. Mr.
Garner has put the piece on the boards in a style
worthy of the best London theatres, and his ar-
tist, Mr. Gordon, well deserves the encomiums
that have been passed on him. Our artist (on
page 4) gives a view of the cave scene and also
some sketches of the principal characters. No. 1
represents Mr. F. Marshall as “Danby” and Miss
Annie Taylor as Mrs. Danby. No. 2is the cave
scene. No. 3 represents Miss Blanche Stammers
as Marguerite and Mr. Titheradge as Evanscliffe.
No. 4 is Mr. Cates as Edgar Neville, the artist.
No. 5 is Mrs. Gordon as Lady Clare and Mr.
Titheradge as Evanscliffe. No. 6is Mr. Barren
as the fisherman, and his boy. No. 7is Mr.
Arthur Garner as Dr. Mortimer. The piece, it
is almost needless to say, is remarkably well
played by Mr. Gamer's company.

of Messrs. Royle and Hogg, Bond Street, is the most
perfect thing of the kind yet introduced to the colony.

departure of the John Elder on the 14th.— Hercules

The half-yearly sale at the “ Bon Marche,”
King-street, which has been on for the last month, has
again been a great hit. The “ Bon Marche ” is an es-
tablishment conducted ou the same principles as the
famous “ Bon Marche ” in Paris, where the great mass
of the people are attracted by the excellence of the
articles offered for sale and the extremely low figuees
decided on.
At a meeting of the Rocky Mouth Regatta
Committee, held ou Friday night, it was decided to
give a £lOO prize for an outrigger race, for all-comers
in light skiffs, £4ofor a farmers’ race, £5; and for
butchers, and bakers* boats, £5; for an amateur race,
a silver cup and £5; for a boat race of 600 yards, a
silver cup and £5. Rush and D'Donald are in active
preparation. The regatta is expected to be a great
success.
During the present scarcity of water in the
Suburbs, it may not bo out of place to point out that
very many diseases arise from drinking impure water.
A preventive is within the reach of all, in theform of
a reliable Filter. We can with pleasure testify to the
excellence of Cheavin’s Rapid Water Filter, which can
be procured from Messrs. Lassetter and Co., and when
the outlay of a few shillings may be the means of
keeping disease away, we think no one will be without
one of these useful adjuncts to the household.
Towards the close of his lecture last Sunday on
“ Gospel Contradictions,” Mr. Bright referred to the
conflict between Science and the Bible. On the
authority of Dr. Draper’s popular history he showed
that the earth was the centre of the universe, until
conquered by astronomy. They had affirmed that all
the life on the earth excepting what was saved in an
ark had been destroyed by a deluge. This was disproved
by geology. They had asserted that man was created
perfect some six or eight thousand years ago and fell.
But anthropology showed that man existed far hack in
geologic times, and in a savage state. Science was the
master of the Bible, and compelled different interpre-
tations to be put upon its writing age after age. The
conflict, added the lecturer, was nearly at an end and
j was becoming ludicrous.
At the annual general meeting of the board of
management held at the Great Synagogue Chambers
last Sunday, the Treasurer’s account was'read and con-
firmed. The Hon. Saul Samuel, C.M.G., was elected
president, Mr. Moses Moss vice-president, and Mr. D.
L. Levy treasurer—all three gentlemen being unop-
posed. A ballot taken for the election of a committee
resulted in the return of Messrs. H. E. Cohen, M.L.A.,
S. A. Joseph, David Mitchell, J. L. Isaacs, David
Marks, George Myers, S. Ackman, C. Cantor. A vote
of thanks was accorded to the president for the service
he had rendered on so many occasions. The president
in reply stated that although he had been appointed to
a high official trust as Agent-General and should
probably be leaving Sydney in a few weeks, whilst
taking a temporary farewell of his co-religionists he
never forgot the kindness and co-operation he had at all
' times received from the board of management and the
congregation. Other business of minor importance
was disposed of. A subscription list was handed round
for the purpose of a testimonial to be presented to Mr.
G. L. Goodman on his retirement from the office of hon.
secretary, which was liberally responded to.
Mr. Godwin writes informing us with reference
to a paragraph recently published that he has not yet
offered the agency of the Strauss Baud to any one and
that he is in receipt of a cable to the effect that the
baud (numbering between 50 and6o, under Herr Kratzt),
left England per Aconcagua on 18th current, and are
consequently due in Melbourne about 19th Oct. The
committee of the Victorian Racing Club have very
generously placed Flemington lawn at Mr. Godwin’s
disposal, free of all charge, for Saturday afternoon
promenade concerts; and the railway traffic manager,
acting in the same spirit, has agreed to run people
out to the course for 6d ahead first-class return (usual
fare 3s). Thus it will be seen that the big venture so
far, is warmly appreciated on “the other side." The
band’s first performance at the “ Exhibition ” is fixed
for Monday, October 11th. Melbourne Town Hall has
been secured for three evenings a week (orchestral per-
formances) Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday; and we
are glad to hear that there is brisk competition for
securing the first services of the band —as much as £5OO
having been offered in one instance—for the takings at
the first promenade concert.
Election Mems.
It will be seen from our advertising columns that
a numerously signed and thoroughly representa-
tive requisition has been presented to the Hon.
Sir George Wigram Allen, asking him to stand for
the new electorate of the Glebe. This is the first
requisition presented to any member of the
present Parliament, and indicates the esteem
I in which Sir George is held. The inutility of
opposition to the gentlemen who has so worthily
occupied the honorable post of Speaker in the
present Parliament will be readily seen, and
doubtless he will be awarded the honor of a walk
I over.
We are not suprised to hear that a requisition
is being influentially and numerously signed in
favour of Mr. C. J. Roberts (ex-mayor of Sydney)
asking htm to allow himself to be nominated for
East Sydney. Mr. Roberta’ return is considered
I safe.
We understand that Mr. Edward Hordern, Mr.
T. J. Chapman, and Mr. J. G. Hanks are the hon.
secretaries for securing the return of Mr. C. J.
Roberta for East Sydney.

The Return of Boyd.
Robert Watson Botd, the Middlesbro’ sculler,
since his return from America stated to a representa-
tive of The Newcastle Chronicle, with reference to
the race for the Hop Bitters Prize, that his boat, the
Alexandra, was damaged during the voyage across the
Atlantic, and he had in consequence to row in a shell
belonging to Hanlan, which carried him well enough in
the smooth water; but when a southerly wind sprung
up, about half a mile from the stake.boats, it began to
fill rapidly, and he was waterlogged by the time he had
made the turn, from which part he had the greatest
difficulty in keeping himself from sinking. With regard
to Hanlan, Boyd attributes his defeat mainly to the
enormous exertions which he made to neutralise the
disadvantages under which his station at the start
placed him. Boyd estimates that Hanlan had at least
one hundred and fifty yards further to go than Ross,
who had also further advantages of slack water and
shelter. Nevertheless, Hanlan succeeded in securing
and holding a lead of from two to three lengths until
the wind sprung up, when the extra distance he had
travelled and the rough water seemed to tell upon him
all at once, and Boss shot past him a quarter or a mile
from the stake-boats. Then Hanlan gave up, and
neither he nor Boyd passed the finishing-point. Boyd
reports Boss to be a much much-improved sculler, and
likely to prove formidable to whomever may meet him.
Mr. John Harris, M.P. for West Sydney.
We give the portrait, to-day, of Mr. John Harris,
one of the representatives of West Sydney in the
Legislative Assembly, and now announced as a
candidate for the same electorate in the coming
campaign. Mr. Harris may almost be called an
Australian, having arrived in the colony with his
parents at the early age of five years. He is es-
sentially Australian in his aspirations and instincts,
and while actively associating himself with the
solid progress of that portion of the metropolis
where he resides, he has ever been one of the first
to give a hand to the advancement of the colony
whenever it' came to compete with the outside
world. Mr. Harris represents one of the wealthiest
landed families in the metropolis, and it is much
to his credit that the vast interests committed to
his care have been improved in a manner to greatly
enhance their value, and add to the importance
and character of the locality in which they are
situated. Mr. Harris has been an alderman for
seven years, and a member of the Assembly for
the past three years. He has in both capacities
proved himself to be a quiet independent worker,
never bidding for popularity, but conscientiously
discharging his duties for tlje general good. In
the Council, Mr. Harris’ services have undoubtedly
been of great value to the city, his actions at all
times being marked by shrewd common sense and
thorough independence. Mr. Harris’ career in
Parliament is well known. He has not been de-
monstrative,‘.but has preferred to hold to principles
of unobtrusive usefulness and independence. The

Fowler’s Pottery and Brick Works,
Camperdown.
Ok page 5 we give an illustration of the pottery
and brick works of Messrs. E. Fowler and Sons,
Camperdown. These works may be described as
the most extensive of the kind in the colonies,
and are a monument to the energy and great
business capacity of the man who established
them. The works cover an area of about three
acres and are situated on the main road leading
into Sydney. The very best branches of the potter’s
art are to* be found in operation here, and the
manufacture of drain pipes, etc., is carried on to
an enormous extent, the pottery in the latter
respect taking a leading place among the large
factories of these colonies. The extensive brick
kiln, which is built on a new principle, enabling
operations to be continued without cessation
from year to year, is not the least attractive
portion of the works. The bricks manufactured
by the new process are admittedly far superior to
those made by the old. They are manu-
factured to the extent of many thousands per
day, and there is no doubt that but for this new
source of supply building operations in Sydney
and its suburbs would during the past six or
eight years have been seriously hampered. Work
is given all the year round to a large number of
hands, and a very close bond of union exists
between Mr. Fowler and his men.
"Stray Leaves."
Miss Ella Cabeington’s Company, under the above
name will commence their entertainments at the
School of Arts on Monday next. They have been most
successful during a recent tour in ® in ®*
arriving in N.S.VV. The company includes—Mr. C. H.
Taylor, from the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, a
remarkably clever and versatile Mtor,
Miss Ella Carrington is spoken of by the Bendigo
Independent as “an accomplished actress and singer,
her vS roles being all rendered with pleasing and
correct taste. Miss Nellie Mausell is reputedly a
Sr young actress, with a sweet mezzo soprano
voice Mr J. F. Fordo was one of the buffo
singers in Mr. W. S. Lyster’s Opera
Mrf J. A. Delany is musical director. A varietyof
beautiful scenes of a dioramic nature, painted by Mr.
John Hennings, of the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, add
greatly to the effect produced in the ‘Stray Leaves.
The whole of the entertainment is sparkling in original
sketches and novelties, and abounds with amusement
throughout in a musical and dramatic form.
DENOMINATIONAL DROPS.
There are 300 Quakers in Australasia.
The Loudon Unitarians propose to erect, at a
cost of £5OO, o statue to Robert Baikes in front of the

Elder Ball, the Mormon apostle, has been very
successful at Oamaru, N.Z. Several families have ex-
pressed to the elder their intention of receiving bap-
tismal immersion at his hands.
With reference to the Bradlaugh episode,
Spurgeon writes“ In my judgment no man should be
made to sulfer for his religious opinions, and men of all
creeds and of no creed have a right to be represented in
the|House of Commons if they ore numerous enough to
return a member.”
In last issue of the Express there appeared a
very caustic leader entitled “Bishop Barker and his
Duty.” In the article referred to, which is evidently
from the pen of Archbishop Vaughan, the position
assumed by the Anglican Church in regard to education
is forcibly commented upon. The writer says: “That the
real Protestant Bishops of the present day are not Dr.
Barker, and his suffragans, whatever their names may
bej but Mill, who said that he would prefer eternal
punishment to worshipping a God who could invent it,
Qrote, who ‘ cordially sympathised ’ with that view ;
Tyndall, who says he can prove that prayer is never
heard ; declares that God is ‘unknowable ;*
and Lecky, who calls future judicial awards ‘pernicious
superstitions.’ These are the real shepherds who are
leading the flock which Dr. Barker, oppressed with his
high sense of * duty,’ is following with a helplessness
which becomes absolutely sublime —from his uncon-
sciousness of it. We have to wait a few years, and, if
he be spared, this modern shepherd will find that the
Public schools are os certain ‘ death to the calling of
the Anglican clergy’ as they are seed-plots of Agnoe-
ticism, and of all tliat follows from it. flio duty or
Dr. Barker, as described by himself, is rather that of a
butcher following his flock to the slaughter, than of a
shepherd laying down his own life for his sheep. Wo
prefer Shepherd Smith to Shepherd Barker." From
whatever point of view one regards the question at
issue, the intelligent reader will find the article, through
which runs a current of bitter satire, well worthy of
perusal.

Now that Meston is in supreme control of the
Brisbane Observer (and the ancients) the subscribers
to that paper are expecting to have at least a column of
Aristotle every day. Several sage-femmes have already
intimated their intention of petitioning the Insolvency
Court.
One of the most charming toilettes in Sydney
at the present time is that worn by a well-known leader
of fashion residing in Macquarie-street. A moss-green
walking dress and toque to match, with a neck-
let of pink pearl-shells, the tout ensemble being most
tasteful.
Prominent amongst the choristers at St. An-
drew’s Cathedral on Sunday last was a certain much-
indicted up-country judge. The anthem “I will
Eve thanks" his Honor sang with remarkable gusto,
et us hope that this was in anticipation of “a happy
issue out of all his afflictions."
Apropos of a divorce suit which is shortly to
take place in Sydney, we may mention that revelations
of a character involving some men in high positions are
likely to be made. One of tbe gentlemen concerned
nas already left for Melbourne, bearing in mind no
doubt the adage that 41 Delay is dangerous."
The prettiest walking costumes seen in town
this winter are worn by two young ladies well known in
Sydney society, and consist of tight-fitting blue serges
with the tasteful accompaniment of large black hats.
One of these fascinating sisters completes the tout en-
semble with white turned-down collar and cuffs.
Henderson Africanus the third Ambassador, is of
opinion that the Berry Ministry will not stand three
months, because they ignore the resolution of the
Council dated 30th August 1871, claiming two responsible
Ministers of the Crown, which points to Statestic Law
and has the force of a standing order of Parliament
according to Imperial practice.
A gentleman lately left the Queensland Civil
Service and received £6OO compensation for the loss of
his billet. Since his departure it has been found that
he drew and cashed a cheque for £750 for which no
vouchers can be found in the office. He is connected
with the creme de la creme of Queensland Society
and on dit there is not likely to be any prosecution.
There is a certain peer of England, formerly
very prominent in politics, who has lately disappeared
from the public gaze. The reason has never yet been
given in print, but it is this: That he is subject to
kleptomania, and wherever he goes he pockets loose
articles. He is very wealthy, and his failing is known
in London society and condoned, but his public career is
over.
With this issue goes the ambassador of New
South Wales, Mr. John Davies, M.P., to Victoria. He
travels incog., and it’s very likely that he won’t get an
introduction to the Associated Press correspondents of
the South. As he’s just about as good as any “ ambas-
sador ” that has been cruising about of late years the
Victorian newspaper people ore requested to oblige
New South Wales by paying every attention to the
distinguished gentleman and providing hin with a small
glass and a big fork.
Very swell wedding in a certain church, Bris-
bane. Full choir service, eight bridesmaids, church
beautifully decorated and crowded with fashionable
audience. The parson could not resist such an oppor-
tunity. The plates were sent round and a handsome
collection taken up. The bridesmaids say he is ‘‘a
mean old thing, there,” because the bridegroom had
presented the church with a handsome cheque to defray
all x’s. Few days later another swell wedding at same
church. The ladies were satisfied to remain outside
and congratulate “dear Amy" as she went from the
porch to the carriage. “You know, my dear, the
church smells «o stuffy on week days."
At a meeting held a httle while since, a comine
bpintualist noted for the magnificence of his Sheik-like

Sir George Grey when at the Cape of Good Hope
had some fierce enemies. Here is what one of them
“ got off ’’ about him :
“ Mankind have long disputed at the Cape
About the Devil’s colour and his shape.
The Hottentots declared that he was white;
The Dutchman swore he was black as night.
But now all sink their differences and sav,
They feel quite certain that the Devil’s Grey."
Willy Fowlos the genial Registrar of the Supreme
Court, Brisbane, died last week. There .were five
applications for his billet even before he had*drawn his
last breath. The most eager of the candidates was a
man who the previous week had slanged the Govern-
ment at a political meeting hold at Ipswich. Betting
is now in favour of Mr. Bell, deputy Registrar of the
Court.
TTie Yag. thinks of going for Wollombi.
liotti Wilmot will contest Newcastle at the next
election. Had they not better hitch ? Their descend-
■ direct male line would be bound to be Colo-
Y r , easure . rs at tLe ver 7 leas t. and might provide for
the old age of either of these “ stumpists." I should
not care to prophesy (says our Brisbane correspondent)
what their direct females might do, but horses in the
next generation would certainly have no hind legs—if
it is possible to talk them off.
M. Rosenthal, who was defeated by Dr. Znker-
tort in the great chess match, is the gentleman
who in 1871 vanquished Mr. Wisker. The latter gentle-
man beat Zukertort in the following year, so that it
might have been thought that all the chances were on
M. KosenthaTs side. However, Rosenthal is eight
years older now, and is not physically so strong as his
adversary. As has justly been observed, a chess-player,
like a cricketer, soon becomes an “old man.’’
. The members of the Union Club are about to
pive a grand ball, and a ball-room is being prepared on
a splendid scale. There will be many disappointments,
for everybody cannot be invited, and all will wish to be.
It will be indeed hard for the members—young, middle-
aged and old—to deal with the claims of all the ladies

to obtain cards by every means in their power.
The most distingue looking men who have visited
Brisbane for some time ore Jimmy Ewan, the
chairman of tne A. S. N. Company and Moses,
they both wore black hats and frock coats and Trouton
would not walk with them. Moral for visitors from
the South.-Never wear black hats and frock coats in
Pey,strike terror into the Block. Graham
Nixon, of the Queensland Insurance Co., is the only
local man authorised to wear them, but his coat was
"savaged” tn Sydney.
Weddings are a prevalent mania in Brisbane
just now. Three have taken place in high circles
week. One was on heiress from Victoria, and
the High Sheriff and Crown Solicitor gave away their
danghters. Three others are on the tapis, two beint-
in military circles. •»
A private assembly ball was held at the Council
Chambers, Hunter’s Hill, on Friday night, at which
about 120 ladies and gentlemen were present. The
room was very prettily decorated, and the band played
an excellent selection of music. A dark Sydney belle
who seemed to “ carry all before her," is said to have
divided her programme between three gentlemen, owing-
to the absence of ** the buttons. 0 Great disappoint-
meat and inconvenience were caused to some Balmain
residents who wished to attend, but were prevented
from doing so by the fact that the special steamer
leaving Sydney at 7 p.m. did not call at Darliug-street
wharf, as arranged, because, it was said, there was too
much wind. It was, however, noticed that the Balmain
steamer went alongside with ease. The steamer re-
turning after the hall was delayed an hour through
steam not having been kept up.
One of Nature’s ladies graced a box in the
Queen s Theatre on Saturday night. Whether her
presence there was the result of accident or not we
■W t know, hut it is certain that she conducted herself
with an easy grace and abandon that might well have
excited the envy of our ladies of ton. Her attire for
that exalted position was, to put the matter mildlv
rather “ loud.” Her dress, of calico buff, was covered
in front with a white “ pinafore,” evidently fresh from
the starchy way.’ Around her neck was a gorgeous
red scarf, and her head was surmounted with a hat of
immense proportions, lined with green and ornamented
with a white feather. In one of her hands she held n
cotton pocket-handkerchief, and in the other lay partly
concealed an orange, with which she occasionally re-
freshed herself. Her acquaintances below seemed
numerous, and to them she occasionally wafted a grace
ful smile. Altogether the theatre presented no other
such picture of graceful elegance and easy repose.
Among the marriages announced last week
m a certain colonial newspaper was that of a youue-
lady who was once before wedded under some
I h: dn£ e f C V har ’ lf UOt fT Rntic > circumstances.
A youthful scapegrace met her a year or two since
at the most fashionable watering-place of which
her colony boasts, and induced her to run away with
him She ran accordingly, and two hours after she
left her father s house she was united to her lover
by an obliging clergyman who didn’t ask too many
questions. But three minutes after the marriage regis-
ter had been signed the “ irate father,” armed with a
heavy horsewhip, put in an appearance and “went
for the newly-lledged son-in-law, who consented as a
quid pro quo tor being spared the terrible “ walimr ” fw
was in store for him, to leave his bride at once and re.

Belton photographed the scene from a window of the
Sne^i 8 ! 63- « street was at the time absolutely im-
tbe taces of-the throng—anxious, curious,
do wncast, and amazed—are for the most
part very happily caught.
. r 'p ie pI ELD „ of June last records the death
?L Aan ® anOl JJ- a remarkable woman of rowing cele-
Sbe often took part in aquatic contests, and
successful, but her crowning effort was in
18-j j, waen she took over to Havre a four-oared crew of
r v? Wl \ SOX and , rowed against a dozen crews
of Frenchmen. The race assumed an international
character, and gave rise to an irmaense amount of ex-
citement. Though astern in the first portion of the
race, the stroke of Ann Glanoill finally brought the
Englishwomen to the front, and they won by a consi-
derable distance.
With regard to the paragraph in our last con-
cerning Mr. Brett’s new boat, built by that well-known
firm, Donnelly and Sullivan, the builders write us stat-
ing that the craft in question is built on the model of
the Swaddle and Winship boat belonging to E. Laycock
and is callable of carrying 14 st. if required. They say
she is one of the prettiest boats ever turned out of their
sheds, and that they alone are responsible for the
model, with which Mr. Brett had nothing to do. They
will be glad to show her to anyone interested. By the
way, the fact that Trickett has elected to row his race
against Hanlan in one of Donnelly’s boats speaks vo-
lumes for the colonial builder.
The following acceptances were received on
August 2nd for tbe Canterbury Jockey Club Handicap,
a sweepstake of 20 sovs. each, with 500 sovs. added.
Second horse to receive 50 sovs. from the stake • third
horse to save his stake, two miles: —Foul Play 9at,
Be Loup Bst 91h, Nataton Bst 61b, Hornby Sst 51b, Be-
trayer Bst 51b, Grip Sst 3lb, Volunteer 7st 131 b, Norse-
man 7st 101 b, Pinflre 7st 131 b. Sir Modred 7st 31b,

121 b, Sir Garnet 6st 91b, Tbe Governor 6st, Leveller
6st 71b, Nautilus 6st 71b, Virginia Water 6st 21b. Very
little betting has taken place so far, but Foul Play, Le
Houp, Hornby, Betrayer and Hilarious are most
fancied.
At the annual meeting of the Wanganui Jockey
Club the balance sheet showed the receipts for the year
to be £3,016, and the expenditure £1,166. Daring the
year over £lOOO had been spent on the improvement of
the course and grand stand. The spring race meeting
was permanently fixed for the last Friday in Octobe,
and programmes arranged, giving £340 for the day. The
programme for the autumn meeting on the second
Thursday and Friday in March, 1881, wasalso arranged.
It was decided by a narrow majority not to continue the
One Thousand Pound Cup, but to give £6OO for chief
race and add to amounts of other races. The autumn
programme contains events of £1630, including handi-
cap of 250 sovs. first day, and handicap of 600 sovs.
second day.
Great preparations are about to be made in
N.Z. for the Intercolonial Regatta, to be held at
Auckland in February, 1881. The Aucklanders have
sent home for an Outrigger suitable for 12st. men, with-
out provision for the coxswain. The work has been
entrusted to Messrs. Swaddle and Winsbip, of New-
castle-ou-Tyue, England, and all the latest improve-
ments have been ordered to be introduced in its
construction—sliding swivel rowlocks, slidingseats, self-
steeringgear.&c. The cost will be between £6O and
£BO, and the boat is to be delivered in December next.
Xhe tollowing crews have already signified their iuteu-
tion of competing The Thames, White Brothers,
(Mercury Bay), the Dolly \arden crew (Wellington),
Wanganui, Christchurch, Karapoi and Dunedin. Is
Sydney to be represented in this race ? asks our corres-
pondent, The prizes offered (the programme of which
has been published in Sydney, are very liberal.
“ Sinbad ” has published an interesting article
showing the doings of the leading N.Z. jockeys during
the past season, and concludes it with the following
table, showing the number of mounts each has had
and the number of races won and lost:—
Clifford and Matthews have complained (since the list
has been published) that several of their winning
mounts have been omitted, but no reliable account of
their doings could be found.
The following interesting particulars concerning
Blackman, Laycoek’s opponent, are given by “ Cloan-
thns of the Australasian : —“ In August, 1875— a
young oarsman, Thomas Blackman byname, made his
debut in a sculling race at the Thames Regatta, for
persons who had never competed for a stake of £lOO.
b ,. ls rac ®. b ® wo ° easily,- be was only 18 years of age,
toll and slight and his style was the crudest conceivable.
Having proved that he could stay as well as go fast, his
physique—being over 12st in weight, and 6ft lin in height
Drought him prominently under notice as a sculler
who would probably be some day champion of England.
His form improved, and in the following year he again
won a sculling race at the Thames Regatta, in August,
s ,°° n aft .® r had a match with one Strong, whom he
defeated easily. At the November Thames Regatta of
sa “ e 7®“ he defeated Higgins in a heat of the
Scullers Race, but he was overmatched by Boyd in tho
final heat. Higgins was said to be short of condition.
His next performance was against a north-country
sculler, R. Lumsdeu, who was considered good enough
to be matched against our own “ Ned ” for the cham-
pionship, but the Tyuesider forfeited on account of
festered hands—at least so it was alleged. The Tyne
man had been easily defeated by Boyd, and I have no
doubt whatever but that Lumsdeu’s backers did not
think their man good enough for the Australian, and
therefore forfeited the deposit then down. Blackman
and Lumsden met ou the Tyne. The former had the
worst station, being much exposed to the high wind
and very rough water; while the Tynesider had a com-
paratively sheltered position. The Londoner led for a
mile and a half, and getting into some heavy surf was
then collared by Lumsden, who led by a few feet for a
very short time only, as Blackman again shot away, and
won the remainder of the race easily. A match with
either Boyd or Higgins was then confidently expected,
but os these men were at tho time engaged in a contest
for the championship, no more was heard of Blackman.
1 believe, lio»vevor, tliat as lie was still growing, and
required age to mature his strength, he yielded to the
advice of his friends to retire temporarily from active
rowing. It was about this time that negotiations were
opened up with Blackman by two well-known Mel-
bourne sporting men to come out to Australia and row
Tnekett for the champion ship ; but the Londoner de-
clined unless he could visit us as at least the best man
:n England.
The diameter of tho earth multiplied by 10S
gives the diameter of the suu; the diameter of the sun
multiplied by 103 gives the mean distance of the sun:
and the diameter of the moon multiiilied by 108 gives
the meau distance of the moon from the earth.
There was no preaching in a Kansas town the
other Sunday, and all iu consequence of a practical joke
perpetrated by a lively young girl, who, inspired by the
world, the flesh, and a little of the devil mixed, sat
down late on Saturday evening, and sent a note to all
the pastors. Each contained these words, “ All is dis-
covered—fly,” Every one of the four fled.

Buffer asserts that some few of our stock actors

The following elaborate conundrum, says a

no one, save he, as an actor, can write a. good piece ?

entitled “ One Hundred Thousand Pounds." A non-
suit was recorded on the following grounds:— l, Be-
cause the certificate was not in accordance with the
statute. 3. Because there was no proof as to the iden-
tity of the piece performed with that on account of
which the plaintiff claimed. |3. On the ground that the
Court had no jurisdiction. 4. That proof of the copy-
right must be made by the copyright itself.
An English paper contains the following Mr.
Herbert Keeves, son of the great English tenor, had a
splendid reception on the occasion of his debut. As he
stood on the platform to sing his first song, the anxious
audience were struck with his singular personal like-
ness to his father. Face, figure, walk, and even style
of singing were wonderfully alike, but, alas, here the
likeness ended, for however sweet his voice may be, and
notwithstanding the art with which he sings, it must
in truth be confessed that his voice is but a weak echo
of his father s, and this opinion was confirmed after
hearing him sing the second and third time.
Speaking of the ‘’Pirates of Penzance,” a ’Frisco
correspondent writes •' —‘‘This sprightly operetta, which
has had a long and successful run at the Bush-street
Theatre* as you probably know, is by Gilbert and Sulli-
van, and is sister to “ Pinafore,” being a satire on the
English army, as the latter is on the navy. The music
is charming, and Emilie Melville, as usual, enchants the
audience. There is, however, a good deal of plaigarism
throughout—noticeably a chorus, which is almost an
exact repetition of one in “ Martha.” Then there are
the “ Pinafore ” bits here and there cropping up But
on the whole, it is delightful, and draws. Still we have
only two theatres open, where once there were five.”
De Lias, lessee and manager of the Theatre
Royal, Auckland, N.Z., in giving evidence in the copy-
right case brought against him, said: —‘ ‘He engaged
the actors and found the house, it being arranged that
the expenses were to be a first charge upon the receipts,
and after that the profits were to be equally divided be-
tween the “ star ” and himself, the “ star ” finding the
pieces and giving his services. This was an arrange-
ment often made. By finding the pieces he meant that
a star ’ always brought his own pieces in order to
play them. The “star” brought the properties and
some of the scenery and the books themselves. This
gentleman is notorious among the profession ar being
the hardest manager in Australia.
Our correspondent at Auckland writes by the
last mail: —Steele’s Stock Company have been doing
wretched business since last X wrote, not taking enough
money to pay the rent of the theatre, the poor unfortu-
nate actors and stage hands thereby suffering. As far
as the male members are concerned it is a really
capable company, but a good leading lady is sadly re-
quired. With the exception of Patterson and Reynolds
and his wife (Grace Hathaway) the other members of the
company have been hereabouts for the last eighteen
months, which .is far too long for a small town like
Auckland. Mr. and Mrs. Xangard open in a week’s
tune, and as they are universal favorites a great change
may be expected. Mr. and Mrs. Hart and their daughter

The Theatre Royal, Christchurch, N.Z., has
been splendidly re-decorated by J. S. Willis. It will
interest our theatrical friends to know that the dome
has been finished, and the upper part prettily orna-
mental in French grey, warm crimson, and green.
Round the lower base runs a band of silver and grey,
key pattern, the outer edge being filled with medallions
ot the arts and sciences. The effect when lighted up is
exceedingly pretty. On each side of the proscenium is
a fluted column, the flutes of which are alternately
white and gold, the caps and bases being finished in
gold. The circle itself has been decorated wth French
grey and crimson, and the pillars supporting it have
been painted and gilded at the caps. The theatre has
been re-opened by the Arethusa Dramatic Company,
who are doing good business. The principal members
of the company are—Mrs. Walter Hill, Miss A. May,
Miss Cora MTan, Miss Bessie Vivian, Miss H. Lam-
brette, Messrs. C. Burford, D. Clinton, J. Tyrrell, J.
Stark, J. Hooper, and E. Alexander.
George Eignold (“ Handsome George ”) has
been doing big business at the Queen’s Theatre, Man-
chester. A recent issue of a London paper has the
following concerning an accident which happened to
bun “ George Rignold went through his performance
as Henry V. He had won his battles against fearful
odds, and on his noble white charger had bowed his
acknowledgments of the enthusiastic plaudits which
greeted him, and was just thinking of going home to
supper, when a roar from the front demanded another
uplifting of the curtain. Then again the spectators
gazed with admiration upon the victorious and hand-
some monarch and his creamy steed. Suddenly the
animal stumbled, and down he went, with his leg in a
hole. It was the off hind leg, and there was some fear
that the hind leg would have to be “off” in another
sense, as the poor brute could not extricate it. Rig.
nold was as cool as the proverbial cucumber. He was
seen kneeling behind the animal, giving directions
through the now wholly open trap to those below
Suddenly the horse rolled over and disappeared alto-
gether. What became of it remains a mystery to many
until this day; but as the bold George presently ap-
peared before the curtain to announce that no injury
had been received either by himself or the charger, I
suppose it was all right."
Town Amusements.
THEATRE ROYAL.
Buknand’s great comedy-drama, “The Tarn of the
Tide,” still draws crowded houses at the above theatre.
The scenery, which has never been equalled in Aus-
traha, is as beautiful as ever, and at each representa-
tion charms are disclosed that it is impossible to realise
at once. Mr. Gordon has conclusively proved that he
is an artist of the first order, and in this comedy has
eclipsed all his former efforts at scenic painting. The
strength of the company is necessary for the cast,
and the many merits and points of the play are brought
out by excellent all-round acting. The costumes of the
ladies who dress os ladies—are rich and elegant in the
extreme, particularly those of Mrs. Gordon and Mrs
Marsha!! The " Turn of the Tide ” will be continued
until further notice.
QUEEN'S THEATRE.
The Juveniie Pinafore Company opened their season
on last Saturday, under the management of Mr. G. B.
W. Lewis, and are attracting immense audiences. The
theatre has undergone a much-wanted painting and
cleaning, and has been greatly improved in a short time.
The children who perform the principal characters dis-
play wonderful talent, notably Baby Flora Graupner as
Josephine, Miss M. Weir, Bill Bun tin, whose now horn-
pipe is exceedingly well done; Master C. Driscoll, Dick
Deadeye; and Master C. Osmond as Ralph Rackstraw.
They have extremely good voices, and sing with a clear-
ness and accuracy which is surprising. Their know-
ledge of the stage business is worthy of imitation by
many adults in the profession, and reflects great credit
on then: teacher. The strength of the company is about
00, and the lilliputian sisters, cousins, aunts, and
sailors present an extremely pretty picture when they
are mustered on the deck of the good ship “ Pinafore."
The orchestra is first-rate, and altogether the perform-
ance cannot fail to attract large and appreciative
audiences. Some of the children are charming little
creatures. They are exceedingly well-cared-for by Mrs.
Lewis, who looks more matronly than ever when seated
at table at the Post Office Hotel with the fifteen
principal performers around her.
A Quartzopolitan Speculator: Or, Aarons
and the Air Compressor.
Isaac Aakons was apprenticed at an early age
to an Israelite in Petticoat Lane. He engaged to
serve his master faithfully for a period of seven
years, and the latter bound himself to teach young
Aarons many useful ways of getting a living
among others the very difficult art of selling to a
stranger, as a new article and a perfect fit, a
second-hand coat which touched him all over and
fitted him nowhere like a sentry-box. The young
fellow’s master was reckoned one of the smartest
hands in the trade. His knowledge of the world
was derived from hereditary development assisted
by wide experience. He had no book learning
and rather despised those who had. When the
project was on foot to buy up Palestine in order
that the Chosen People might return to the home
of their fathers, Mr. Abrahams—that was the old
gentleman’s name—smiled. “ Vill there be no
Zhen tiles dere?” he observed to the zealous co-
religionist who had called for his subscription.
“Few. if any,” was the answer. “Den how de
devil do you ’spect an honesht man to live,” said
the old gentleman as he locked his till and retired to
his back parlour.
But the day came when young Aarons was
thrown on the world through the sudden death of
his good master. It appeared that a low Irishman,
to whom the young man had sold for five shillings
a pair of pantaloons which cost nine pence,
wheeled a barrow of bricks past the door just as
the old man was starting for the Synagogue to
forgive his enemies. It may be safely asserted
that there is far less danger in stumbling over an
earthquake than over a barrow of bricks—
especially if it should capsize and place the bricks
on the small of your back before there is time to
recover yourself. Even the negro delineator who,
owing to judicious padding, it is said, allows him-
self to be scandalously kicked and beaten about
certain portions, of his body is apt to draw the line
at fire-bricks applied to the vertebral column.
Well, Mr. Abrahams tripped over the barrow and
never recovered the shock. He died as happily as
most men die who leave the world wiser than they
found_ it and who have never been “ bested ” in a
bargain. He left young Aarons a second-hand
suit of clothes and his blessing and started for
the bosom of his namesake.
We have now to follow the fortunes of Mr.
Aarons. He saw at once that, smart as he was,
there was scarcely room for his talents in a com-
munity crowded with young men whose heads were
stuffed with schemes for reconstructing society
on a more equitable basis while their stomachs
were sadly in want of what, in lieu of a better
term, might be designated a “ good square meal.”
The gold discoveries in Australia were about this
time _ attracting attention. Thousands were
starting for the new El Dorado, and the names of
Ballarat, Bendigo and Fryer’s Creek were as
familiar to Cockneys as those of Seven Dials or
Eatcliffe Highway. Four days after a certain
vessel had passed through the Needles young
Aarons appeared on deck sauntering about as if
he had paid a .saloon passage and owned part of
the cargo. The captain was a choleric man but
reasonable ; so, when he had bent a belaying pin
and shoved his toes through his boots in per-
suading the young man to be a little less cocky
and in impressing him with the magnitude of the
offence he had committed by hiding his light in an
empty pork barrel until the ship was well through
the turbulent waters of Biscay, he calmed down a
little and gave him over to some sailor-men'to be
instructed in the useful accomplishments of
swabbing the lee-scuppers and chewing weevily
biscuits.
It would take too long to follow closely the ad-
ventures of Mr ; Aarons through all the ups and
downs of colonial life. Society was inverted, and
has not yet recovered its equilibrium. From the
places where stately banks and music shops raise
their palatial fronts in Melbourne teams of bul-
locks were to be observed, driven by men whose
speech, although possessing some useful charac-
teristics, was not the language of the boudoir,
nor is it often met with in the Queen’s
speech or the archbishop’s pastoral. Booted
and, it must be confessed, not over-well-washed
diggers jostled each other in the places where gay
young ladies and severe chaperones now trip
daintily. • It was a phase of colonial life which, in
Victoria at least, is almost as obsolete as are
sedan chairs and knee-breeches.
Mr. Aarons at last found himself at Quartz-
opolis, just as quartz reefing was beginning to
push its way to the front. He obtained posses-
sion of some ground on one of the lines of reef
and patiently waited until adjacent discoveries
made a valuable property of what a few years be-
fore was a worthless hih. Then he blossomed.
A great many similes will suggest themselves—
Solomon in all his glory ; Napoleon crossing the
Alps in an open boat; Faust when he seals his
compact with the fiend; King Buggaboo when he
ornaments his nose with his wife’s osfemoris;
Mr. Gatehouse as he careers wildly in his chariot
of fire ; Dr. Beaney as he draws from the armoury
of his caustic humour missies to “ smother the
lot; ” Jack Gardiner, M.P. for Carlton, as he
knocks at the Treasury door for hi s “ sugar ; ”
all these might be thought typical of Mr. Aarons’
B-y as the golden quartz gave up the treasure it
concealed for unnumbered ages, but they are
hackneyed and commonplace. He became a Jus-
tice of the Peace, a patron of literature, and a
member of the School Board. And here it may
be necessary to step aside to notice an
example of one well-marked peculiarity of
mining towns. It is related that once
upon a time two anthropoid simians started
from Melbourne to seek their fortunes.
They arrived at the diggings and commenced
gold - seeking in one of the adjacent gullies.
One was unlucky, and after a time was cap-
tured and sent back to his cage in the Royal
Park. The other dropped upon a nugget of ex-
traordinary size. He is now universally respected
and has a seat in the Town Council.
We now come to a crisis in Mr. Aarons’ life. A
short time ago there was a great rage for working
drives,crosscuts and shafts by means of air compres-
sors. Mr. Aarons bought a machine, and the idea
struck him that compressed air, if properly directed,
could be made to perform a variety of useful
offices. With him to think was to act. He had
the air conveyed to his drawing-room by means of
underground pipes. It happened that one morn-
ing, when there was a pressure of about fifty
pounds to the square inch, the nursemaid, with
the charming curiosity of her sex, turned the
cock, in order, as she subsequently admitted
when picked up on the roof, to see if she could
keep the baby quiet with the noise. Mr. Aarons
was in the summer-house peeling an onion, and
when he saw the chairs and fire-irons coming
through the windows he thought he would defer
his lunch until he had ascertained the cause.
After some little difficulty, during which Mrs.
Aarons had her pannier disarranged, andawen that
formerly disfigured her nose considerably shifted,
the air was shut off and strict orders given to let
the pipes alone in future. It appears that in one
comer of the room stood an organ on which Mr-

Aarons’ daughter practised when they had finished
their daily calisthenics and French. It was a fine
large instrument but with one defect, viz., the
necessity for getting some young man to blow the
bellows while the girls fingered the keys. Now,
human ingenuity, like water, when dammed up in
one direction must find vent in some other. Mr.
Aarons’ inventiveness having been diverted from
the old clothes’ line sought development in pro-
jecting mechanical contrivances for lessening
manual labour. It therefore struck him that,
notwithstanding the recent calamity, compressed
air could be made to perform the work now
delegated to the young men who could never
be depended upon to drop in at the proper time.
He therefore connected the pipe with the organ,
and left directions at the engine house that the
safety valve should be arranged to allow the escape
of the air when the pressure rose beyond 21b.
The experiment was a great success, and Mr.
Aarons often referred to it with pardonable pride.
One night he gave a party to the rank and fashion
of Quartzopolis. There were Mr. Hawk, the emi-
nent financier—formerly greengrocer—who, if
there were any truth in metempsychosis,
would probably have a useful career before
him in somefuturo life as well-developed
hedge-hog. Mr. Airey, the former parlia-
mentary blowhard, whom his friends would
back to surround more raw spirits, and pour over
a public-house bar a more voluminous stream of
perennial drivel than any man of his size and
weight in the district. Mr. Nunn, a sly, deep,
dangerous dog, who sought popularity and a cha-'
racter for moderation while pushing forward sim-
pletons to do his dirty work. Many men are to be
avoided when they frown. One historical person-
age was most to be dreaded when he kissed. It
was when Mr. Nunn smiled and was facetious that
it was necessary to be guarded. It would serve
no useful purpose to further particularise the
cream of Quartzopolitan society. Ladies of ton—
lately employed in the unassuming profession of
mangling—indulged in tournaments of wit, pun-
gent but harmless, which proved their possession
of a keen sense of repartee. Mrs. Smith, a
sprightly blonde of forty-five, remarked innocently
of Mrs. Jones —her rival and a brunette—that
many years ago—but we’ll not repeat what she
said. At last the party was on the point of
breaking up. Mr. Aarons put on his hat to see
some of his guests to the gate, when an event took
place which gave a sad ending to such an enjoyable
evening.
It was nearing election time and men’s minds
were disturbed regarding the rival claims of Mr.
Berry and Mr. Service. The adherents of the
former called those of the latter a ‘ bloated
holigarchy ’ who would grind to dust the faces
of the ‘ brawny sons of toil,’ while the admirers of
the latter addressed Mr. Berry’s followers by the
soothing titles “cut-throats, Communists, socialists
and general pot-wallopers,” who carried red caps
in their breeches’ pockets and pikes and blunder-
busses concealed about their persons, ready at a
given signal to drown law, order, liberty and the
eternal fitness of things ‘in a sea of b-e-l-lood.’ It
happened that Mr. Aarons’ engineer was a law-
and-order man. On the evening of the party, his
neighbour, a gentleman 18-stone weight and a
violent Berryite dropped into the engine-house to
talk the matter over peaceably. Now, it is a
peculiarity of politics that when neighbours of
different opinions meet to have a quiet chat on the
subject nearest their hearts a repetition of the
scene between old Teazle and his wife usually takes
place. The present was no exception. As the
conversation became more personal, the visitor sat
absent-mindedly on the safety valve of the air
compressor to take breath. A considerable time
elapsed, during which time the pressure increased
to an alarming extent. “ Tell you wot it is,” said
Mr. Aarons’ man as he flourished a copy of the
Argus, “ Your ruinged houses and broken heads
won’t do for me.” ‘ No,’ said his rival with a
sneer, as he commenced to ostentatiously unfold
the ‘ Age,’ ’Wen the wealthy lower orders thinks
they has the horny-handed sons of —Geewillikins’
wots that!’ as a terrific explosion was heard, and
a few seconds afterwards Mr. Aarons came
through the roof of the engine-house with the
diapason pipe of the organ under his left arm, and
a manuscript copy of Weber’s last waltz protruding
from his larynx.
He was not mortally injured but presented a
pitiable sight. There was a wild light in his left
eye, and his hat appeared as if a circus elephant
had sat on it as part of the performance. When
picked up he seemed as if he had had a few words
with a circular saw and got the worst of it. Even
in his misfortunes however, he showed that the
spirit of humour for which he was proverbial had
not entirely departed. ‘ This,’ he observed with a
painful endeavour to look pleasant as he spat the
‘ reverie ’ in G’ and a few inches of his wind-pipe
into his left hand. “ This is vot I calls blow for
blow. ’ ’ Mr. Aarons has quite recovered his mishap.
He now intends to lead a more retired life and to
leave experiments to Professor Huxley and Mr.
Edison.
George Milner Stephen and his Marvellous
Cures.
That Mr. Harold W. H. Stephen, who has writ-
ten so much upon other subjects, should publish a
pamphlet explanatory (as he thinks) of his father’s
healing powers, is a circumstance that should
surprise no one, for the author of The Golden
Yankee is never happier than when appearing in
print ; and any felicity he may be in the enjoyment
of, owing to the publication before us, we are very
far indeed from grudging him. Had the pamphlet
been written by a gentleman of less distinguished
literary attainments than Mr. Harold Stephen it
is possible that our notice of it would have been of
the briefest; but we feel that any work, however
trivial, emanating from the brain of “Drill’s”
illustrious author is an event of too much import-
ance to be lightly passed over.
. The brochure, then, which contains some fifty-
oight pages, is written with the dual object of
advertising Mr. Milner Stephen and of furthering
the cause of Spiritualism. It abounds with argu-
ments that are well known, and with clippings that
are delightfully familiar. In' short, an ordinarily
well-read man might, whilst perusing the little
volume, be continually taking off his hat in salu-
tation to so many dear old friends. As might
have been expected, a very great many pages are
taken up by reprints of “testimonials,’ sent to
Mr. Milner Stephen ; but what really causes us
some surprise is that the author, in taking up the
cudgels for spiritualism, leaves the poor angels
completely, out in the cold. Now, though such
conduct on the part of Mr. Harold Stephen cannot
be considered otherwise than as to the last extent
ungallant, yet even this blemish is almost forgot-
ten when the admirably lofty style of the pamphlet
as a whole is taken into consideration. The open-
ing chapter in particular, which treats of Mr.
Milner Stephen’s family and of his personal
achievements is of thrilling interest. The author
says -.
__ As instances Of Mr. Stephen’s versatility of talent it
may be mentioned that he is Jan "accomplished flute
player, and an excellent carpenter and mechanic, of
which last he gave proof by the invention of a gold-
washing machine, which met with much favour from
those who understood its working.”
But the versatility (properly so called) to which
the writer so pleasingly alludes by no means ends
here. We are told that —
“He painted portraits of Christian VIII., King of
Denmark (for which he was honored with numerous
sittings by his Majesty), the Prince of Thum and Taxis,
Prince Esterhazy, and several other notabilities, from
whom he received many compliments and rich gifts.”
And furthermore, additional passages in the same
chapter instruct us as follows :
“Accompanied solely by Henry Inman, afterwards a
clergyman in England (who bravely volunteered when
a small party of marines placed under the command of
Mr. Stephen were panic-stricken and halted), he (then
Advocate-General of South Australia) entered the en-
campment of 200 armed and excited aborigines, and
made prisoner of one of them who had just assassinated
a colonist.
“On another occasion, in the night-time, when five
armed bushrangers had got possession of a hut, and
threatened to fire upon a party of marines, again placed
under his orders, Mr. Stephen (to spare lives) halted
the marines, and proceeded alone to thd hut, when he
prevailed upon the bushrangers to surrender to himself,
and yield up their arms.
“Mr Stephen also personally arrested, in the night,
another armed bushranger, who had fired at the Sheriff
in his house, and who was thereupon tried and executed.
“Finally, it may be added that, throughout his life,
Mr. Stephen has evinced the greatest horror of smoking
and drinking, and that he has always been exceedingly
temperate in his habits.”
These passages alone, are, we contend, worth
more than the shilling asked for the pamphlet,
as they prove how easily one may be deceived by
appearances. There are enthusiasts, we believe,
who profess to descry startling traits of the angelic
in Mr. Milner Stephen’s countenance, and vow
that at times a faint halo of curative glory is to be
observed encircling his head; but to the best of
our knowledge no one has up to this time observed
in the learned gentleman’s physiognomy any ex-
pression of a bellicose nature. Yet here we have
the incontestible evidence of the great man’s son
to the effect that under a seemingly mild
demeanour are concealed the soul of a warrior—
the heart, of a lion. What a pity it is that this
intelligence comes upon us so late! Of what
inestimable value would Mr. Milner’s services have
been on the battle-field of Glenrowan! If his
persuasive powers were sufficiently great to cause
five bushrangers to “surrender to himself,” what
would not his inimitable art of cajollery united to
his Bayard-like prowess have effected with the
small force of the Kelly outlaws ?
We have now done with extracts, and we trust
we have by this time fully impressed our readers
with a sense of Mr. Milner Stephen’s extraordinary
versatility; and of his son’s manifold literary
talents. Had space permitted, we should have
been pleased to clip passages of perhaps, yet
more illimitable grandeur than those we have
already selected: but we think we have done
enough to prove that Mr. Harold Stephen’s latest
production is fully on a par with the other brilliant
works of that illustrious author.
There are captious critics who might perhaps
consider Mr. Harold Stephen’s pamphlet too long
and the genealogical chapter a trifle wearisome ;
but so far as we are concerned we feel that if Mr.
Milner Stephen is the extraordinary versatile
genius he is represented by his son to be, a
volume the length of Burton’s “Anatomy”
would be insufficient in effecting his complete im-
mortalisation. Altogether, we congratulate the
son upon having such a father, and we offer our
felicitations to the father upon possessing such a
son, and, in the words of Rip, we hope that they
will both “ live long and brosber.”
In conclusion, we may observe that the brochure,
printed by Messrs. John Woods and Co., is got
up in the highest style of typographical art, and
if anything further be required to enhance its
attractions, we may add that the cover is embel-
lished with a German “ morter,” and that the
magnificent whole is dedicated to that prince of
geniuses—it wouldn’t be correct to say genii—the
Hon. J. Bowie Wilson.

It was evening. Three of them were killing a

and the third jammed the pistol into the cat’s ear, and
fired, shooting the man in the hand who held the cat,
and the one with the lantern was wounded in the arm.
The cat left when it saw how matters stood, and that
ill-feeling was being engendered.

WOMAN ITEMS.
A “slavey” at the Thames Goldfields, N.Z.,
has been left a legacy of £3,000.
Said Victor Hugo, on seeing a very pretty woman
take the veil, “ When one is not ugly one has no right
to espouse God.”
Oscar Meyer, of the Italian Court, declares that
the girls of Brisbane are far handsomer than those of
Sydney. Be gustibus, dfec.
The Princess Beatrice is actually growing stout.
It is, perhaps, a shocking thing to say about a Princess
of the Blood, but it is true.
An enterprising rate collector has discovered
that one woman doesn’t know what her husband does.
There are a great many women who don’t knc w what their
husbands do.
Said he “ That dear little baby of ours is very
pretty, but Darwin conclusively shows that he’s des-
cended from monkeys.’” "Replied she gently, “ Tom,
speak for yourself.”
They met in the gloaming. “ Charles,” quoth
she, “ I lent you half-a-crown last month—dost thou
remember ?” “ Ah, no,” said he, ' ‘ ’Tis folly to remem-
ber, 'tis better to forget.”
The “ Law Times ” thinks it would not be sur-
prising if, during this or an early Session of Parliament
the rights of a husband to make nuptial settlements
to the detriment of his creditors should be considerably
limited.
Charming young wife ; Charles, dear, perhaps
you don’t know what made your tea so nice this morning
—I suppose that before you got married you usedn’t to
have a pinch of soda put in the tea ? Charles, “ No, I
used to like a little brandy better.”
The fashionable pose at the photographer’s
affected by the London beauties is leaning against the
jamb of a kitchen door feeding chickens. A London
photographer’s outfit requires as many properties and
as much scenery as a modem theatre.
The latest device of pick-pockets is to tickle
with a long coarse hair the noses of ladies who happen
to be looking into shop windows. The lady naturally
applies her pocket-handkerchief to her nose, and the
thief takes the opportunity of abstracting her nose.
It has been gravely suggested in England that
ladies should give up the side-saddle—after its having
been in use 300 years—and ride astride like men, and a
lengthened correspondence on the subject is now
being carried on in the columns of the Live Stock
Journal.
The dramatic editor of a certain paper meant to
be complimentary when he spoke of an actress as “ this
side of 25;" but as she was over 40 she didn’t take the
remark as he intended she should, and waltzed in on
him with a meat-axe and made him publish a statement
that she was only 17.
Miss Ellen Connor, of Christchurch, N.Z., is the
second “ sweet girl graduate ” of the British Empire.
She had the degree of B.A. (“ bachelor ” P of arts) con-
ferred on her at Christchurch the other day and was
presented with a bouquet of choice camellias, in addition,
by the chancellor of the university.
The London “Referee” says:—“lt is rather
disheartening to know that at the last Drawing-room
seven fair aristocrats were turned back by the Lord
Chamberlain for being indecently undressed. He is a
short-sighted Lord Chamberlain too. It must have
been a very fleshly school of adoruament indeed to
attract his attention.”
Young ladies do not care for Proctor now. They
used to believe there was a man in the moon, but
the great astronomer says “No” most emphatically,
and he ought to know. The matter being thus far
definitely settled, that there is no germs homo up there,
what are the fair ones to do now, having no object in
view “ when taking a lunar ?”
The London Lancet urges the necessity of sup-
plying seats to shop girls while on duty, and declares
its intention to publish lists of the names of those
houses which do not at once furnish seats. These lists
will be given to physicians, who will exhibit them in their
families, the ladies of which will be asked not to trade
at shops that,for want of seats, are “cruel to women.”
Fourteen girls, residents of a local boarding-
school are writing a continued story which they say
is going to he published “in the papers.” Each girl
in turn writes a chapter. Already twelve chapters are
finished, and the story thus far concerns twelve splendid
fellows, with long, silky moustaches, twelve beautiful
maidens, with hair that reaches the ground, and twelve
stem fathers. Six of the heroes had each a “ St.” in
his name; the other six are “De ” somebodys.
If he puts his arms around her like a bear and
stops her breath when he kisses her, they are not
married, but are likely to be.—lf he puts his hands on
her shoulders, leans forward a little, snatches the
prize, and falls back, they have been married two
weeks.—lf he comes up with his hands in his pockets,
looks out of the window, says, “ Well, good-bye,” gives
her a tasteless smack, and rushes off, they have been
married two years, and life is a desert.
A man’s slipper is made for comfort. A woman’s
slipper for show. A woman wears her slippers to show
her coloured stockings. A man doesn’t. A woman
kicks off her slippers immediately on gaining the privacy
of her chamber. A man doesn’t. A woman’s slipper
pinches her toes to a point somewhat like unto the
shape of a hen’s bill. A man’s doesn't. A woman’s
slipper is never too tight in company; but how she
groans and grumbles in private—about her corns—not
er tight slippers.
Mrs. Dunn, wife of Mr. Alex. Dunn, Jingellic,
Upper Murray, was recently lost in the bush. Finding
she had no other chance of saving herself, she turned
her horse adrift after tying the stirrup on to the seat of
the saddle by way of showing that she not been thrown.
For two days and nights she wandered about, and on
the second day she tore her dress into strips and tied
pieces on to the branches as she journeyed along. The
search party came on her track and followed the line of
bushes to which the rags were tied until they found
first the tracks of her bare feet (her boots having been
worn out) and then Mrs. Dunn herself.
A lady writing an account of an evening at the
opera in Loudon, recently, said: —“ I had noticed in an
opposite box a lady in cream colored satin and superb
ornaments, who appeared to be more than half asleep.
As I was coming out I encountered her. A gentleman in
faultless evening dress was addressing her in a low voice.
I heard him say, ‘ Stand as straight as you can. The
carriage will be here in a moment. You must stand
straight! ’ A kind of desperate look was in his face.
His companion was intoxicated! A few moments later
he almost lifted her into the carriage, which rolled away
bo one of the 1 stateliest homes in England,’ if home it
can be called, where the master shuns the eye of his
own servants, knowing that they are aware of his wife’s
disgrace."
Says the Melbourne correspondent of the Warr-
nambool Examiner :—Two women were talking outside
a door, and it was evident that one was detailing to the
other the injuries she had received from a neighbour,
who was to be seen a little way off looking defiantly over
a back fence. “ I’ll murder the wretch,” screamed the
virago, shaking her fist at the delinquent, and with fury
enough in the face to make one think she was equal to
it. Just poor rat, chased by a cat, sprang past
between the two women, and each uttered a fearful
shriek and ran pale and trembling into the house,
shutting the door behind them. When dogs are fighting
a sovereign remedy is to throw a bucket of water over
them, and if two viragoes are at loggerheads just let a
rat loose.
There have been two duels lately in N.Z. In
one, “two Lotharios basked in the sunshine of a cer-
tain young lady’s eyes and called the other out. Having
arrived at the chosen spot on a rather dark night and
seconds appointed in the orthodox style, the opponents
blazed away at each other until one of them was
wounded in the shoulder, when he acknowledged that
his friend was now entitled to the lady, and accordingly
retired from the amatory contest.” The second affair
was conducted in the American fashion. Late one night
two young men had a quarrel, and feeling that the only
way to settle the affair was to hack each other’s ears
off, they proceeded to do so with the aid of sailors'
knives. They cut and sawed each other until a large
pool of blood was drawn, when, feeling quite satisfied,
they went on their way rejoicing.

CHAPTER XV. —( Continued).
“What did the poor woman do?” asked Sebas-
tian.
“ Eh, hoo just dropped th’ fryin’-pan, and hoo
gave a screech yo’ mowt a yeard down to th’ town-
hall, and then who begun to cry, and then they
browt him whoam. Mun I lock up, sir, now?
Have you finished.”
“Yes, quite,” said Sebastian, with a good-
natured nod. “ Lock up, and go home. You’ve
not had much of a holiday this afternoon.”
“ Bless you, sir, it’s no soart o’ consequence,”
said Ben, with a gratified look at this mark of at-
tention ; and he retired to lock up again.
“Will you drive?” asked Hugo, when they
were alone.
“No ; I’ll let you drive on, if you will. And
stay! Wbat do you say to a drive in the country
before dinner ? It will be daylight for a long time
yet. If there is any country about here?” he
added, with a despairing look around.
“ Oh, lots ! While you have been so industri-
ously grubbing away at these figures, and showing
me quite a new phase in your character, I have
been exploring the interior. I know of four
separate and distinct routes to the country. Cer-
tainly it is rather stony when one does get there;
but it is country all the same. Will you go north,
south, east, or west?”
“ Hurrah for the North !” said Sebastian, dryly.
“ Turn the horses’ heads towards Yorkshire mein
Hugo /”
Hugo complied. Very soon they were rattling
through the main street. Hugo’s attention was
taken up with the guiding of his cattle. Sebastian
leaned back, a little wearily, and was long silent
until they had left the town behind them —left the
dirty straggling suburb called Bridgehouse, and
passed through the neighbouring manufacturing
village of Hamerton, with its stately houses of
gentry and rich mill-owners, and were put out
upon a wide, open road, past a solemn old house
called Stanlaw, deeply sunk in trees. Beyond
that, the purple moors spread before them, rising
every moment higher and nearer. The sky was
pure, the air sweet. As if with a sudden impulse
they both turned and looked behind them. A
heavy cloud of smoke showed where Thanshope
lay below.
Hugo shrugged his shoulders.
“ Comfort yourself,” said Sebastian. “ It won’t
be there Ion". Soon we shall see what Thanshope
looks like without smoke.
They drove quickly on in the sharp, delicious
October afternoon air, along the upland road.
Tbe beather sprang from the very road-side, and
rich, mellow, purple, brown and crimson, the
moors spread themselves around, under the pale,
chill blue of thejcloudless sky. The peculiar scent
of the ling and heather rose like a pastoral incense
around them ; far away glittered the sinuous line
of a canal, and a silvery pond or two. The crack
of a gun broke the stillness once or twice.
“ Did I not tell you I would bring you out into
the country?” said Hugo.
“You always manage to keep your promises,
somehow” (they were speaking German now).
“ How goes the music under these changed con-
ditions, Hugo?”
The lad smiled, and said:
“ The more prosaic the surroundings, the more
need one has of something like music to brighten
them.”
“ Just so. I only asked because I have not
noticed you practising, and as for sitting down
and listening to you—why, the last time I did that
was when Miss Spenceley was at the Oakenrod.
“ You have been so busy. I have practised hard
enough, only your mind was taken up with other
things.”
“ Ay, with things less artistic than the Sonatas
of Beethoven.”
“ But not more earnest and workmanlike. Do
you know, I like this Thanshope. There is some-
thing real in the life these people lead.”
“ There is so ! And in the things they say, and
the way in which they remind you of your duties.
There is a fellow I am very curious to know some-
thing more about. Do you remember that brusqne
individual who confronted us the first time we
drove to the office ?”
“ Perfectly well. Do you never see him ?”
“ Oh, daily. I have just had another shindy
with him. He piques me excessively. Every
time I see the fellow, with his handsome face and
defiant eyes—he has a pair of eyes—l feel as if I
must stop and question him upon his thoughts and
feelings. It is a most insane idea, and it makes him
exceedingly angry; but it is so, all the same.
What is that air you are humming, Hugo ?”
Hugo held the reins loosely between his fingers,
while the horses climbed slowly up the hill; he
hummed to himself the half-melancholy air of the
German Volkslied — Der Verschmahete ; and Sebas-
tian listened attentively with a half-smile.
“Aren’t you tired Hugo? Let me take the
reins.”
“As you will!” said Hugo, changing places
with him, and they turned homewards again.
‘ ‘ Do you remember when we last heard Der
Verschmahete ?” asked Hugo smiling to himself.
“Perfectly,” said Sebastian. “Corona Mliller
sang it, and ”
“ There was instrumental music, too,” put in
Hugo ; “ one of Liszt’s Hungarian Rhapsodies—
ay, ay ! And it was a Rhapsody too ? How splen-
didly she played it! It would have delighted
Liszt himself. Do you remembenthe end ?”
“Yes, yes! Un poco pesante /” said Sebaa-
tian, who listened attentively to the reminiscences
but volunteered no remark upon the subject.
They were now again in Than shop" and the
dusk was beginning to fall, though it wa till far
from dark. There had been a silence. Now, as
they turned into the main street, Hugo, suddenly
taking courage, looked up into hia companion’s
face, and said:
“ Sebastian, do you know where she went with
her father from WetzlarP”
“ No, I have seen nothing, and heard nothing
of her since then,”
‘ ‘ But you have inquired ?’ ’
“ Inquired —naturally. But—ah, there s my
handsome young democrat. Just take a good look
at him. Hugo—quick ! before he turns off —do you
hear? What? Impossible!”
Hugo had touched his arm, so that his attention
was diverted from the figure of Myles Heywoqd,
who was in the act of turning off down a side
street, and directed towards that of a young lady
going straight down the main street, and whom
they were now in the act of passing.
It was nothing remarkable for an expression of
lively excitement, pleasurable or otherwise, to be
seen upon Hugo’s face, but such a look upon
Sebastian Mallory’s counteance was a rare visitor ;
and it-painted itself there at this moment, as his
eye fastened upon the slight figure of the girl, who
was pursuing her way, looking neither to right
nor left. Would she see them ? Would she turn ?
No —yes —no ! The phaeton had just passed her,
when she casually raised her eyes, and glanced
towards the road; and then into her face, too
leapt the same startled 100k —the same surprise and
vivid emotion of some kind as that which already
brightened Sebastian’s. She made a visible pause
as her eyes fell upon the occupants of the carriage.
Both hats were lifted, two deep bows were made
at the same moment; four earnest eyes looked
eagerly into her face. With a sudden, quick,
warm flush, she returned the bow of the young
men, and then they had driven on, and left her
behind them.
They were almost at home now, close to the
Oakenrod. No word was spoken, until, as they
sprang out of the carriage, their eyes met, Hugo’s
full of inquiry, Sebastian’s of a trouble and ex-
citement strange to them.
“ Are you glad?” asked the boy, in a low voice,
as they hung up their hats.
“ Nay, mein Bester —time alone can tell me that.
I know no more than you. But here —how did she
come here?”
CHAPTER XVI,
“ Mais pourquoi pour ces gens un interet si grand ?”
One evening—it was Sunday, the day after that
drive into the country—Sebastian Mallory strolled
into the drawing-room where his mother sat, and,
glancing round, seated himself, without speaking,
at the piano, on which he struck some aimless
chords, which presently developed into a coherent
harmony, in a style un poco pesante. He played
the first bars of Liszt’s second Bhapsodie Hon-
groise, and then paused.
“ What is that thumping thing ?” inquired Mrs.
Mallory, whose many mental superiorities did not
include an understanding of the art of music.
“This ‘ thumping thing,’ as you justly term it,
is a ‘ Hungarian Rhapsody/ by that Thor the
Hammerer of pianoforte music, Franz Liszt.”
“ I am as I was before.”
li Wimports! Where is Hugo, I wonder ?”
No reply.
“You have not seen him ?”
“I saw him leave the garden about an hour
ago.”
“Goneout for a walk, I suppose. I am glad he
can find anywhere to go to.”
“ Sebastian, may I ask how long a visit that boy
is to pay here ?”
“ Visit!” said Sebastian, turning round on the
music-stool, in some surprise ; “ why, Hugo lives
with me. I thought you knew.”
Mrs. Mallory lowered her favourite weapon the
feathery screen.
“ Lives with you? What will you say ?”
“ I can but repeat my previous statement. He
is my ward—you do know that, mother —but then
we drop that connection as much as possible. _ I
suppose we are more like brothers than anything
else.”
“You are the guardian of his property, then?
He is a von —is he of noble family ?”
“ Two questions. He is of noble family. Von
Birkenau is a good old name, and ha is the last of
his race. As for property, he has none —not a
scrap.”
“How came you to be his guardian? It was
very extraordinary—so young a man as you. Had
his family, or whoever left him to you, any claims
upon you?”
“ It was his mother who left him to me, because
I asked her to. She had no claims upon me in the
legal sense of the word; only the claim of having
been my great friend, and the source of inesti-
able benefit to me. Paula von Birkenau was a
woman in a thousand, beautiful, good, and gifted;
and, I am sorry to say, very unhappy.”
Mrs. Mallory, watching her son’s face, thought
how odd it was that he should have such queer,
out-of-the-way ideas and tastes. What could
there be in this memory of an impecunious German
countess to bring that smile to his lips, and that
light of subdued enthusiasm into his eyes ?
“If her son had no property how did she manage
to live?”
“ She was penniless when she married, and her
husband’s family had been a declining one for gene-
rations. When he died, she was left without a
stick or stone of land or house, and without a
penny of fortune. She retired into a Stift —an in-
stitution, you know, for poor ladies of noble family.
There are many like it in Germany. She procured
admittance for her son into a place of the same
kind—a school, where he was hard-worked and ill-
fed, and quite unable to pursue the real bent of
his talent, for music. I made the acquaintance of
Frau von Birkenau six years ago. I could not
describe her : she was a beautiful soul; she did
more for me than anyone I have ever known. She
talked to me a great deal about her boy, and I went
to see him. I liked him, and I told her so. She
asked me if I would think of him sometimes, and
perhaps pay him an occasional visit, when she
should be dead ; she suffered from a painful com-
plaint, and bore her sufferings like a heroine. I
said tbe best and shortest way would be for her to
make a will, appointing me her son’s guardian,
when I should have full authority over him. This
she did, about four years ago, and very shortly
afterwards she died. On my signing the document
to the purport that henceforth I undertook the
duties of a parent to him the authorities of the
school permitted me to remove Hugo, to his and
my satisfaction. Since then he has been my com-
panion in ail my ramblings, and though I don’t
wish to sound my own praises, I must say he looks
a different fellow altogether from the white-faced,
pinched-looking lad whom I took away with me
overwhelmed with grief at his mother’s death.”
“ In-deed!” observed Mrs. Mallory, in cold
tones of intense, though repressed, exasperation.
“ It sounds like a page from a romance. If my
opinion were asked, I should say I could hardly
tell whether he or you stood most in need of a
guardian—of some one to control you. You have
encumbered yourself with his entire maintenance ?
He is a pensioner on your bounty ?”
Sebastian shook his head. Leaning his elbow
upon the top of the piano, he remarked:
“ There is no question of ‘ incumbrance.’ I
love the lad. I delight to seehim growing happier
every day, and to know that his powers are expand-
ing in the direction best suited to them. It is
not every one who can secure the pleasure of
enabling an artist nature to grow and develop in a
congenial soil. As to his being ‘ a pensioner on my
bounty,’ excuse me, mother. I mean no disrespect
when I say that I dislike that expression intensely.
If you had not used those words, I should not have-
mentioned that Hugo knows nothing at all of this.
All he knows is that lam his guardian. I let him
live under the impression that I guard not only
himself but his property. And the impression
must not be disturbed. I will not have his hap*
piness embittered just when ho should be able to
throw aside all care for everything except his
studies. He is intensely sensitive. I never ap-
proach the subject with him —yon understand?”
“ I suppose I do. But I consider it the most
amazing piece of folly I ever heard of. How do
you know what he may turn out?”
‘ ‘ How, indeed ? At least he will have had every
inducement to turn out well: and, unless lam
much mistaken, he will do so. It is not only his
name and lineage that is noble.”
“ I thought you were a Radical! observed Mrs.
Mallory.
“ My dear mother !”
“That Frau von Birkenau must have been a
clever woman —too clever for you, at any rate.”
“Please don’t say anything against her. I
would as soon say anything against youas against
her,” said Sebastian, calmly; and his mother,
meeting his eyes, found herself blushing for her
own meanness. Such signs of sensibility are often
reckoned hopeful.
“ Is he to be always here?” she asked quickly,
to cover her confusion.
“I don’t know. He will please himself. At
present England is new to him. He may enjoy it,
or study it, until he gets tired of it; and then, I
expect he will go to some German musical Conser-
vatoire, to study just as he pleases. I shall give
him his choice.”
“Humph!” said Mrs. Mallory, with indescri-
bable significance of tone.
“But, I repeat, he is never to be told of hia
position. I shall explain it all to him myself, when
circumstances make it desirable. And I think you
will get to like him, mother. He is the best-
hearted fellow, and absolutely adores those who
are kind to him. He is a perfect child in some
ways.”
“ I don’t like young men who are like children.”
‘ 1 Well, I like Hugo. It would pain me exceed-
ingly to have any misunderstanding with him,”
said he, with an emphasis unusual to him as he
again turned to the piano, and solaced himself
with a waltz of Schubert.
Mrs. Mallory sat puzzling angrily over the
character which daily baffled her more completely;
its traits becoming more involved, enigmatical-
nay, to her, insane. She considered this freak of
his to display an eccentricity not short of insanity
but strangely enough she did not dare to tell b‘m
so. Did he care for any one ? Was he so devoted
to this lad, whom she disliked for his fantastic,
unconventional habits and speech, and whom she
would regard -with contemptuous pity, as he sat,
the morning long, at the piano, absorbed, with
strange tossings of the head, and quaint, absent-
minded wavings of the hands, and contortions of
the body ? Or was he only obstinate to have his
own way, amd'provbke her, his mother?
At this moment the door was opened, and Hugo
entered, followed by the butler, with tea.
Mrs. Mallory was too much annoyed to linger
over that refreshment. She drank it quickly and
went to her writing-table, where she turned over
the papers, listening vexedly the while to the talk
between Sebastian and Hugo —talk in which she
had no sort of share—about music, and foreign
friends, and foreign countries ; and she heard
Hugo express his rejoicing that at last he could
have an hour of Sebastian’s company, and she
heard Sebastian answer, that he was glad too, for
that he missed his companion. And she knew the
tone was one of genuine affection; that Mr.
Mallory of the Oakenrod was perverse enough to
{)in his affections rather upon an eccentric, penni-
ess German lad, than to make acquaintances
which would be to his advantage : that her chance
remark about the cleverness of the late Frau von
Birkenau had been, in vulgar parlance, “abad
shot ” —a very bad one indeed, and that she had
not increased her own influence by making it.
The laughs and chaffs of Hugo and Sebastian
became intolerable, as forming a running accomr
paniment to reflections of this nature. She made
another shot, this time unconsciously; and this
time she hit her mark, also unconsciously. Picking
up a note which lay upon the table, she suddenly
interrupted the conversation.
“ Sebastian, here is a note —it must go to yon
now, I suppose. I have nothing more to do with
these affairs.” _
He looked up ; rose and came to fetch it; smiled
as he took it; but she would not see either smile
or look.
“ It is from Mr. Blisset,” she remarked, appar-
ently busily arranging her papers. “ Something
about repairs. I cannot imagine what he wants
doing, I am sure.”
“Mr. Blisset —who may he be?” inquired Sebas-
tian.
“Your tenant. Ho lives at Stonegato, that
place up at the other end of the town, which yom’
great-grandfather built, and which has always
been a great deal more trouble than profit.” ri ,
How long has this Mr. Blisset been its tenant J .
“ I’m sure I don’t know. Eight or nine years,!
think.”
“Do you know anything about him—who he is,
or where he comes from ?’ ’ ,
“No. He is an invalid —paralysed a most
crotchetty, tiresome person. ’ ’
“ Ah! Let me see what he says.” .
He opened the note, and his face changed as h®
saw the handwriting. It had been addressed to
Mrs. Mallory, as had probably all other communi-
cations on the subject. The hand was small, com-
pact, and characteristic —the matter was business-
like. _ ~
“ Mr. Blisset presents his compliments to m.} ■
Mallory and begs to inform her that the outsi
of his house stands in need of some repairs bet
the winter sets in. If Mrs. Mallory will have
kindness to send her agent, or the workpeople
usually employs, to inspect the house, Mr. Bn
will feel extremely obliged to her. ” . Q
Sebastian without comment handed the not ,
Hugo, who read it with a smile, and an e^c }.
expression which caused Mrs. Mallory to se
down in her mind as a lunatic. m
“ I will have it seen to !” was all Sebastian• ’
carefully putting the document into a small
Ca “ 6 i should send Mitchell to make an estimate •
he will do it as cheaply as any one,” observed
Mallory.

OBITUARY.
IT is with the deepest regret that we have in this
issue to announce the decease of Mr. Liberty of
the Press, who after a painful illness has died and
been buried by the State. The unfortunate deceased
had for many years previous to his untimely end
been in a by no means robust condition, but he
had nevertheless, with an energy invariably
•characteristic of individuals of his class, managed
to discharge his daily duties—and with an amount
of vigour which people, because he was stout,
regarded as perfectly consistent
•with his physical condition. He
was born in England, and as per-
sons who reach their majority in
that country have a much greater
chance of longevity in the colonies
than people of Australian birth
it might by those unacquainted
with the chief incidents in his
career be considered somewhat re-
markable thathe shouldhave given
g o little notice before “shuffling off
this mortal coil.” However, his
robustness was more apparent than
real; his internal organs, severally
and generally, were in a state
fatty degeneration, and the im-
mediate cause of death was rup-
ture of a blood vessel in the
brain.
The deceased having been taken
suddenly ill in King-street, was
examined by several medical men
who happened to be within call.
His malady, it was clearly seen,
was chronic, and consequently not
such as would entitle him to be
admitted to the Infirmary, whence
he had been discharged on several
occasions as incurable. He was
therefore by order of a Judge of
the Supreme Court, sent te the
gaol hospital in “Black Maria”
—the vehicle, which but two days
afterwards was again used as his
hearse.
A certificate in the usual form
having been given by Mr. O’Connor, gaol surgeon
(whose skill had been vainly exercised), the body
was wrapped in a shroud, without frills,
kindly made by Madame Lotti Wilmot, and con-
sisting of old numbers of the Evening News and
Daily Telegraph. It was placed in a ten-
shilling coffin of plain deal, and kindly humped
out of the gaol yard by an obliging Celestial,
whom we took to be one Moy Mow. However, as
Chinamen, like monkeys, babies and green peas,
don’t differ much in physiognomy, we may pos’-
sibly have been mistaken. The proceedings at
Haslem’s Creek were of the most unostentatious
kind. Around the grave, which was dug in un-
•consecrated ground and was of extra depth, there
assembled a number of the personal friends of the
deceased, among whom we noticed the following
gentlemen : Messrs. Alfred Bennett, Angus Mac-
E. E. Waters, J. M. Lynch, J. Hogue,
Watkin Wynne, and J. C. Kerr—who all dropped
silent tears as the shell was lowered. No funera 1
service was read, but immediately prior to the
commencement of actual burying operations Mr.
Alfred Bennett, amid choking sobs, impressively
recited the following:—

years ago he started the I Mercury. “It still
lives and so does he,” was the finals. The compo. of
the Northern left out the “v” in “ lives.” If Tommy
sees it there will be an action for libel, sure.
The other day we wrote something about babies
and bulldogs. Babies are still, it would appear, at a
discount and dogs at a premium. In Monday’s Herald
appear the following advertisements: —“ For sale; pure-
bred retriever pups, from prize slut by imported dog.
J. West, Evaus-street, Balmain.” “Wanted, lady to
adopt motherless boy, 18 months old. 71 Devonshire-
street.”
His Lordship Bishop O’Quinn laid the founda-
tion stone on Sunday, 15th inst., of a church at Goodna,
Queensland. Father Breen, through some negligence,
forgot to bring out the papers and coins which should
have been placed in the bottle under the stone. In
desperation, the Bishop asked, “Has anybody got a
newspaper ?” and Tom Brady innocently handed him a
copy of the Wesleyan Evangelical Standard. The
paper was not placed in the bottle.
A colour merchant in George-streot was applied
to for some Venetian red to “ clean scales.” He thought
the idea had no weight, so he pressed the customer and
found the colour was for imparting a wholesome tint to
German sausages. He refused the vend, as also some
ShielTs green required for painting up calves’ heads,
and making them look ghastly at night. Surely our
meat inspector is not so colour-blind as to permit these
disgraceful ornamentations of human food.
An embryo Ben Franklin, hailing from Waverley,
heard that black cats were capable of giving forth
electric shocks. On his way from lunch the other day,
he strayed into a fruit shop in Pitt-st. A fine sable cat
was purring gently on the counter, content with herself
and all creation. The navant pretended to select some
fruit, but took a base opportunity of roughly rubbing
the feline’s spine. He was shocked—to see the cat go
for, and throngh, fruit and glass. Total damage about
10s.
The following is a sample of “ spirit poetry:”—
Knowest thou, thy friends are watching
At the gate of Spirit land;
Waiting there with hands to welcome
Thee, unto a loving band.
A prosaic indi' idual on reading the above expressed an
opinion that if they waited at the gate until they joined
the “ loving baud,” they would stand a good show of
catching the influenza.
A tall stalwart gentleman, who is well known
on Moore Park, where the colour of his locks
corresponds with the warmth of his temper, thrust his
bead out of. the window of a stationary train and angrily
demanded of the guard “ why the train was not
going on ?” The guard quietly responded: “ Oh, put
your head in; how d’ye think the tram's to go ahead
when the danger signal is a stickin’ out ?” That crest-
fallen footballer’s look was a study. He is now known
as the " danger signal."
In a well-known periodical all the poetry is said
to be written “ under spirit control.” Here is a verse
of it:—
“ In thy lonely hours at even,
When thou thinkest none are near;
Then thy loved ones round thee standing.
Bring to thy sad heart good cheer.”
There are men living who could write almost as good
poetry as this without troubling the sprits at all! A
true poet, by the way, would have considered “ beer ” a
good rhyme for “ near.”
A correspondent says that the paragraph in
last week's Bulletin, in reference to Mr. Soares going
through the snow expressly to marry a happy couple,
stands out in bold relief when compared with the action
of the authorities of a certain local cathedral on the
the occasion of a thanksgiving service. The collection
on the day in question was so great that they positively
declined to administer the rite of baptism to some ten
infants who had been presented for that purpose, the
only excuse being that the money collected must be
counted, and that by the time that counting was
finished it would be too late. It may, continues our
correspondent, be consoling to the person who declined
the duties to be informed that one of the infants was
very sick, and has since died without being baptized.
A North Shore man went fishing last week in
company with a friend and some whisky. The N.S.
man, when he parted from h s companion after the
cruise, found that his share of the plunder consisted of
a very fine schnapper, with a string through its gills
and most of the “comfort.” “At the ferry” he laid
his fish down beside him and dozed, and it was then
that a funny fellow took out a big knife and cut its
body oft. As soon as the boat stopped the North Shore
man, who didn’t let the string go for a moment but was
innocent of all knowledge of the decapitation, awoke
and marched off with “ his fish.” Suddenly he fell down
and it was then he noticed for the first time that the
glory had departed and that he would have nothing to
place against his inebriated condition on reaching home,
but what was at the end of the string, “ Ha! ” he
remarked, kicking the head, “ Knew D well I near
pulled hish hed off. Made game struggles too, in water.
—hie—fine fish.’*
By those of our readers who have a fair know-
ledge of Victorian politicians and politics—and what
reader has not ?—the following " musical programme
arranged for a ‘liberal’ caucus meeting” (extracted
from Melbourne Punch) will be found intensely amusing.
Some of the allusions are witheringly sarcastic :—“ Oh,
lot us be happy together ” (chorus), TheSugar-Loafers ;
“ The Tar’s farewell ” (solo), Mr. John Woods;
“ Strangers yet ” (duet), Sir John O’Shanassy and Mr.
Berry; “The A.B.C. Guide” (arranged by Ketten),
Professor Pearson; “ When shall we three meet again ”
(trio), John Woods, Francis Longmore, and Sir Bryan;
“ If I had a 1,000 a year Eobin Euff ” (solo and chorus),
Mr. John James, “and his sisters and his cousins and
his aunts, especially his cousins, whom he reckons up
in dozens ;” “ Pro peccatis " (Eossini),Mr. D. Gaunson;
“Happy Land” (solo), Mr. Longmore; “Old Mother
Hubbard she went to the Cupboard, &c., Ac." (not even
a solitary 6d.J, The Treasurer; “Farewell, my gallant
captain, I told you how ’twould be” (solo, Mari tana),
Mr. Bowman, on taking leave of Mr. Berry ; “ Still our
fancy can discover spots where friends may dwell, darker
shadows round ua hover, Isle of Beauty—faro-thee-well ”
(chorus). Disappointed office-seekers. Part second.
“ Awake iEoliun Liar, awake ” (chorus), Ananias; “ Oh!
Erin my Country” (especially the county Clare), Sir
Bryan O’Loghlen; “ Oh! smile as thou wert wont to
smile,” and “ Oh! whisper how thou feelest" Mr. John
Woods to Mr. Longmore, and Mr. Longmore to Mr.
Woods; “The good boy (bye) at the door,” Mr. John
Woods; “I love but thee,” viz., 300 per-annum, (a
patriotic song arranged in every key), The Company in
•unison Chair, Boys, chair,” Mr. Mirams; “Nil
desperandum,” Sir John O’Shanassy; “ The Minstrel
Boy to the war is gone,” The Major, “ with his martial
cloak around him;” “Mourir pour la patrie,” The
Speaker; “ The time I’ve lost in wooing, in watching j
