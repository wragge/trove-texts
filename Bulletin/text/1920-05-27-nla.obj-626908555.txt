This Week’s Toilet Hints
THE LATEST AND SMARTEST BEAUTY RECIPES COLLECTED
FROM VARIOUS EXPERT BEAUTY WRITERS.
A “BLACKHEAD” SECRET.
An instantaneous remedy for blackheads,
oily skin, and enlarged pores.
Blackheads, oily skins and enlarged pores
usually go but can be instantly
corrected by a unique new process. A tablet
of stymol is dropped in a tumbler of hot
water, which will then of course “fizz”
briskly. When the effervescence has subsided
the face is bathed with the stymol-eharged
water and then dried with a towel. The
offending blackheads, of their own accord,
come right off on the towel, the large oily
pores immediately contract and efface
themselves naturally. There is no squeezing,
forcing or any drastic action. The skin is
left uninjured, smooth, soft and cool. A few
such treatments should be taken at inter-
vals of three or four days thereafter in
order to ensure the permanence of the pleas-
ing result so quickly obtained. Stymol tablets
are obtainable from your chemist in
original packages.
GREY HAIR—HOME RExMEDY,
An old-fashioned home-made recipe restores
youthful appearance.
There are plenty of reasons why grey
hair is not desirable, and plenty of reasons
why hair dyes should not be used. But,
on the other hand, there is no reason why
you should have grey hair if you do not
want it. To turn the hair back to a natural
color is really, a very simple matter. One
has only to got from the chemist two ounces
of concentrate of tammalite and mix it with
three ounces of bay rum. Apply to the hair
with a small sponge for a few nights and
the greyness will gradually disappear. This
liquid is not sticky or greasy and does not
injure the hair in any way. It has been
used for generations with most satisfactory
results by those who have known the for-
mula,
TO KILL ROOTS OF SUPERFLUOUS
HAIR.
“Home Science.”
Women annoyed with disfiguring growths
of superfluous hair wish to, know not merely
how to temporarily remove the hair, but how
to kill the hair-roots permanently. For this
purpose pure powdered pheminol may be
applied directly to the objectionable hair
growth. The recommended treatment is de-
signed not only to instantly remove the hair,
but also to actually kill the roots so that
the growth will not return. About an ounce
of pheminol, obtainable from the chemist,
should be sufficient,
THE REAL CAUSE OF MOST BAR
COMPLEXIONS.
“Health and Beauty.”
It is an accepted fact that no truly
beautiful complexion ever came out of jars
and bottles, and the longer one uses cos-
metics the worse the complexion becomes.
Skin, to be healthy, must breathe. It also
must expel, through the pores, its share of
the body’s effete material Creams and
powders clog the pores, interfering both
with elimination and breathing. If more
women understood this there would be fewer
self-ruined complexions. If they would use
ordinary mercolised wax instead of cos-
metics they would 'have natural, healthy
complexions.
ABOUT HAIR TONICS.
“Novel Recipes.”
Each week almost one hears of some
wonderful discovery for improving the hair,
and although this paragraph may seem a
little superfluous, an old-fashioned , recipe
may come as a welcome change. One thing
about it is that it will grow hair, and also'
prevent it falling out. From your chemist
get an original package of boranium, to this
add 1-pint of bay rum, allow it to stand
30 minutes, then add sufficient water to
make half-a-pint. Rub briskly into the
scalp with the finger-tips, and you will im-
mediately experience that clean tingling
sensation which is a sure sign of healthy
action. [ 1

My Books.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My books are like a lovely land
Where Life and Death walk hand in hand,
Where I may pluck in happy ease
A branch of faery fantasies;
Or take the little skiff* of dreams
And sail enchanted summer streams
To reach a blessed isle of light
Where there is never fear of night.
My books are as a magic world
Within this dull one wisely curled—
A realm of immortality
Where I am queen of land and sea,
And all the subjects of the soul
That wander there in Ix>ve’s control
Pay homage to my will and sing
Through my serene imagining.
Hector in anguish fights for me,
Ulysses sails a stormy sea;
Queen Guinevere and Lancelot ride
Between the elm-trees side by side.
And many a man and many a maid
In leafy lane and glad, green glade
To faery cymbals lightly dance
From out the leaves of old Romance.
Ah, mighty kingdom of the mind.
That rules the hearts of all mankind,
When I remember that for me,
For my undreamed mortality.
My little- soul, unthought, unborn.
Great poets sang in some far morn,
r am more humble than the air
Lingering here on Song’s first stair.

ZORA CROSS.
Bow and Arrow Languages
The sentimental or patriotic tendency to-
wards the revival of partly-dead languages
is always with us. The conclusion of the
war has naturally given it a lift in Middle
Europe, for three Powers which made a
specialty of suppressing the speech of small,
conquered peoples have lost their old punch
and found q new one—the one in the eye
that they received themselves. But it is a
left-handed compliment to the Englishman’s
incapacity for absorbing small white races
that, though he hasn’t been defeated or dis-
membered or lost his punch, there are three
such movements, Gaelic, Welsh and Irish,
in his own skimpy isles. Three are a good
many in such a limited space. After all,
and no matter how much sentiment there
may be in the business, the game seems
hardly worth while. An old language has
a claim to be preserved if it embodies
a vast and valuable literature of the poetic
and dramatic kind, that sort, unlike litera-
ture dealing with machinery or medicine,
being damaged by translation. If it has
only a moderate or scrappy literature it looks
like waste to go learning another tongue,
and spending on it the time that is badly
wanted for manufactures, and adding another
barrier to human intercourse, another load
to the mind and another brick to Babel. The
break of gauge at the border is a relic of
barbarism or at least a misfortune.
It is impossible to construct a locomotive
(a loco, lias about 2000 parts) in Gaelic,
or to fly in Irish if the airman carries his
own tools and does his own repairs; or to
light a city with electricity in Welsh.
Steamship-building in Hebrew is. impossible,
and neither modern surgery nor modern
mining can be done with the resources of the
Latin language—classic, not dog. The dis-
ability of the tongues which dropped out of
the hurry and bustle of life 1000 or even
100 years ago is that they are 100,000 words
behind. They must have that number, or at
least some very big number, added to them
to make them equal to the needs of daily
life, and the words wouldn’t grow into the
language and become really part of it —
they would have to be invented and tied on
suddenly and forcibly and artificially. Other-
wise no one could ride a motor-bike with
the revivified speech *r operate for appen-
dicitis (a matter that etaTt wait for speech
to develop) with it. Then the language
would be overwhelmed and wouldn’t be the
ancient treasured sentimental affair that was
talked about at all.
Perhaps three-quarters of that vast, over-
grown, slummocky, ill-spelled but useful
hash of tongues that is called -English was
thrown together or threw itself together in
the last 150 years. New ideas in a multi-
tude of lines, from the theory of wireless
telegraphy with the stars down to the plain
fact of netted wire to prevent rabbits, made
what was really a new vocabulary necessary.
It grew too fast, and even a highly-educated
person can’t keep pace with it, but if any-
one proposed to bring one of the picturesque
bow-and-arrow tongues sufficiently up to date
to be a living thing again it would rather
be a case of building it up in 150 days, and
the pace would be killing. So I have no
enthusiasm about the revival of languages
that are dying and would be better dead. I
wouldn’t go to a Gaelic or Manx philologi-
cal revival conference if I was paid for it.
As I said, the Englishman doesn’t seem
to be a good assimilator. To have three
language revivals in such a small space is
something of an achievement, especially
seeing that the Little Peoples have enjoyed
the blessings of Dr. Johnson’s dictionary for
165 years and Boswell personally conducted
Johnson to the Scotch Highlands so that the
wild people in petticoats might see what a
live-meat dictionary-builder was like.
J.E.
Blackmore’s Additional Verses
The widow of A. R. Blaekmore, Tas-
manian poet and soldier, has collected and
printed, for private circulation, whatever
worth-while unpublished verses her youthful
husband had written prior to his death in a
London military hospital on Armistice Day.
There are some 20 sets of verse, most of
them written during the war, but obviously
not inspired by the war. In fact, apart from
a tribute to Belgium (penned before he left
Australia to fight and . flounder through
Flanders mud with the over-worked heroes of
the 12th Battalion), Blaekmore seems to
have written only two lines of war-provoked
verse: —•
When silent are the hateful drum
And serried cannon roaring hate.
The poet did his share of fighting (thrice
he was dangerously wounded), but he made
no song about it, despite his native impres-
sionability. He probably held decided
opinions about the propriety of discussing un-
pleasant subjects with his gentle Muse. Most
of his war-time verses were written to his
wife urging her to avoid “bodings desolate.”
to be glad of the happy days that were, and
to live in anticipation of the happier days to
come, “when war’s fed riot ends.” He sings
to her that
The light behind us still will burn
Of joys remembered yet—
The gracious gleam of summer eves;
Soft silence of the lips;
The stir of tremulous, soft leaves;
Our foolish quirks and quips;
Familiar strolls o’er rock und sand
In azured afternoon ;
Or sympathy of hand in hand
Where moonlit waters croon.
How often in those pleasant days'
We sought from toil escape,
To hang the billy" in the blaze
O’er heights of Fluted Cape,
Or by a sylvan longing led,
We turned us from the »ea,
Where sassafras and myrtle spread
Green dusks of grai "arye
And woodland treasure won, or read
'Hie author of oiir. choice ;
A streamlet tinkling .o’er its bed
Mingled with yours its voice.
And “when winter howls o’er bay and head
and whips the waves to snow”
The lighted lamp, the white cloth set,
The china’s cheerful gleam,
The vase of early violet,
Have we of these no dream ?
Ah, sure! And of the hours of ease,
With book and easy-chair,
And melody of sounding seas,
And carols old and rare.
And days unborn and golden then
From grief shall woo and wile,
And we shall find our peace again
As in our Blessed Isle.
Readers who are not too old to remember
their own loiterings down in Lovers’ Lane
will readily agree that Fate was unkind in
barring a reunion of the Blackmores.
In Hxtic is all Australian, of course. The
poet sees “coy Dawn display the perfect rap-
ture of each gleaming limb, that may not
brook the shaipeful eyes of Day,” and at sun-
rise “saplings decked in silver splendors chill,
glitter in green with crests of red and gold.”
And a joyous bushland chorister gets a fine
quatrain:—
How dear in mind the trill of magpie song—
Quick flame that quivers in the breath of joy!
Bright warbling notes that sink nor fail, but strong
To win rare heights all pure from sad alloy.
The inscription on the stone that marks
this good Australian’s “possie” in an English
churchyard is taken from “Dusk” :
When at that last strange eve the sun
Fails from my eyes, and I have won
From restless dream to dreamless rest,
Be merry for my sake, my friend:
Let no tear fall, nor long o’er bend,
For though the day be fair, the end
At close of day is best.
Me, when the westing shadows fall
Cool on the grey, old churchyard wall,
Full light the turf will rest upon;
For very tired of mirth am 1
And tired, too, of earth and sky—
Yea ! of all lovely things that lie
In Being’s malison.
Then weep no tear, nor beat too low
Thy heart if I must gird and go,
Not all unloving though unloath—
What make we through the barren years
That have lived but our lives and fears?
Not ours old hopes, not ours new fears,
But shores of sleep and sloth.
And so the end—with a repeat rhyme-word
to keep smaller folks guessing whether or not
it was done on purpose.
JOHN DRAYMAN.
In U.S.A.
A few weeks ago the book department of
that greatest of all department stores, Mar-
shall Field’s, of Chicago, conducted a Book
Fair. The leading publishing houses in the
States were asked to exhibit the works cjf
their best authors; all the well-known accepted
poets, novelists, editors, critics, anthologists
and English Professors were invited to attend,
and if possible deliver addresses; the public
was lured in hundreds of thousands by a
vigorous advertising campaign. Success
seems too cold a word to describe the experi-
ment. For a week there was scarcely breath-
ing room. Celebrated authors, for years
known only to each other through the pages
of their respective books, met face to face,
for the first time, and held post-mortems of
their past successes, or formulated plans for
future ones. The exhibition stalls of such
well-known houses as Putnam’s, Dutton’s,
Doubleday-Page’s, Scribner’s, Lane’s and
Doran’s were things of beauty and joys for
a week. The bookbinders elocuted about the
secret arts of their trade; likewise the type-
setters. The publishers orated on their
wares and woes. The magazine editors spoke
on the current tastes in literature. The
critics and professors exchanged views. Hugh
Walpole called in one afternoon and told a
delighted audience how he created some of
his best juvenile characters. Blasco Ibanez
autographed until he collapsed with scriv-
ener’s cramp. New writers looked on and
smiled and secretly aspired to the author-
ship of best sellers. And all the time the
public came and listened and bought—always
bought—and then departed happily. More
.books were sold in six days than in any pre-
vious two months of the firm’s existence.
Why not try the same thing in Melbourne
and Sydney?
Maeterlinck’s reception in New York City
was “a corker.” “The ’Four Hundred” ban-
queted him; the editors head-lined and syn-
dicated every syllable he uttered ; the Vander-
bilts stood at his side while the camera men

Style & Economy
Go Hand in Hand
The young girl and her equip-
ment are subjects approached
with mixed feelings by many
mothers. Conflicting claims perplex
her; the natural desire of her daughter
for dainty and charming apparel, which
she herself shares, and the demands
of sensible economy, which daily be-
come more insistent. The dress ideals
of both mother and daughter centre
on clothes of charming and appropri-
ate design, carefully fashioned from
materials of fine quality, and moder-
ately priced. Both find the realisation
of such dress ideals in ANTHONY
HORDERNS’ Maids’ Fashion Salon,
on the spacious third floor of the

After Dinner Pill
Most people eat too much. If
you are a hearty eater help your di-
gestion and take care of the over-
load, by taking one Pinkette, the
little sugar coated laxative pill after
a big dinner.
Pinkettes, the new laxative, are
greatly superior to old fashioned
medicines which over stimulate the
liver and, when their use is stopped,
leave it more torpid than before.
Pinkettes do not upset the stomach
or cause griping.

Forgotten Waves: Katoomba.
Once long ago—
I do not know
How long; for time is very old—
In summer’s heat
And winter’s cold
The sea broke here
With measured beat.
Chill, vanished waves !
The wind that raves
And sighs around the heights and deeps
Of ancient Earth,
Perchance alone
Some memory keeps
Of that grey sea
That gave them birth.
No homing sail
At midnight pale,
At sunrise lit with golden gleams,
Sought out the land ;
For less than dreams
Were shaping mind
And guiding hand.
Grey waves, long sped,
What years have fled,
What ages, aeons passed, in truth,
Since on your breast
Huge life uncouth
Swarmed, battled, breathed
In fierce unrest!
Forgotten waves,
Man builds and paves.
And laughs and weeps, where once ye ran
Unseen, sublime,
Ere Love began
Its pilgrimage
Through Space and Time.
Though Earth renews
Its rains and dews,
Its morning-joy, its springtime thrall,
Age, vague and vast,
O’ershadows all,
And most it dwells
Within the Past.

Superstition.
As we came out of Wagga—
You know the winding-track,
You know the ghostly river-gums
In the dust, as one looks back—
I saw two grey birds flying,
A new nest in a tree,
And —one for sorrow, two for joy—
Your face c/ime back to me.
As we drove out of Wagga
Across the flat last night—
You know the dust-cloud in the air-
And how it holds the light—
Toward the new moon, setting
Above the thistle-plain,
I kissed my hand and wished my wish
And—saw your face again.

The Hill Call.
I hunger for the hills again,
The clean blue of the sky;
The squat city upon the plain
Is dreai-y to the eye;
For vague hills in the misty rain
A hungry soul am I.
I would be out where the strong trees
Stand in their massed array,
And look on them when the young breeze
Kisses them in his play—
These are the things which my heart sees,
So I must be away.
I will be miser of moonbeams
Flooding the wooded sea ;
I will be one with the night’s dreams
And the merry creek’s glee,
While on the leaves the soft light gleams
And a mopoke calls to me.
I will pay homage to chaste bi'easts
Mantled in virgin snow,
Blushing against the purple West
When the great sun sinks low;
I will go out and find deep rest
In the kind hills I know.

I remember our fii-st ride together.
The grass was sodden with rain
(Oh, horses in autumn weather!
Oh, hearts too careless of pain !).
Chestnut and bay in perfect time,
We cantered along, your hand in mine,
And our eyes were glad
And our eyes were mad
With the joy of riding together.
I remember our last ride together.
The grass was sodden with rain
(Oh, horses in autumn weather!
Oh, hearts brim full of the pain!).
Chestnut and bay in pei-fect time,
Why was the hill such a weary climb;
Oh, our eyes were sad
And our hearts were mad
With the pain of riding together!
The chestnut lives, but the bay is dead,
And m.v heart is weary, and you are fled ;
And only in dreams of the old bush track
Do we still ride together.

A SEAT ON THE SAFETY-VALVE.
If a sealed vessel has more water poured
into it than it can hold, and then unlimited
heat is applied, things are bound to happen.
In other words, the practice of sitting on
the safety-valve may be carried to excess,
as Czars and Caesars and union dictators
and other dictators have found. As a case
in point, certain bosses who have been set-
ting such an amazing pace in the matter of
wiping out liberty were reported lately to
have planned a censorship that would squash
all comment on their doings and allow none
save ■ favorable remarks and applause to
appear. It was a large order and looked
more humorous than fatal, but the making
of such, a suggestion was a whole essay on
the madness that comes of power or even
imagined power. The Labor bosses already
control papers to which their subject union-
ists are compelled to subscribe under pain
of expulsion and consequent exclusion from
employment, which means starvation; and
they use the law courts to enforce payment of
subscriptions. So the unionist has his liberty
cut pretty short already. He isn’t compelled
yet to read the views of those w r ho write
the union bosses’ papers, but he is compelled
to pay for them. The new and improved
idea was to prevent the publication of any
other views, by ordering union printers,
which means all printers, not to put in
type any matter held by the union censors
to be “in any way detrimental to the Indus-
trial Movement.” That would mean that all
papers except the compulsory-circulation
ones would have to applaud the doings of
Garden and co„ even if these remarkable
people decide to repudiate the public debt
and otherwise make angels weep, or else
they must- confine themselves to agriculture
and remarks about Shakspeare and crochet.
Something was also said about taking 10
per cent, of what the men now earn to
finance a movement for doing less work, and
presumably earning less, which was some-
thing bigger in the way of taxation than
the most shocking Government this country
has yet possessed ever dared to attempt with
the working classes. It was all preliminary
and tentative, but it was evidence of the ten-
dency to wipe out the last vestige of liberty,
and put an official watcher in every house
and an official listener at every keyhole.
Yet this idea of suppressing unfavorable
comment is overshadowed by other projects
of the men who have gone slightly off their
heads. The scheme for the control of the
coal industry as propounded by general-
secretary Willis is even bigger. The mines
are to be confiscated, and “the miners must
have the power, through a council of control
specially appointed by them, to fix their
own wages and conditions of work, and to
deliberate upon the matter of coal-production
and distribution.” This would mean that
a small body of men would control by seizure
or conquest practically every industry, and
stop it at pleasure, and take as much of its
earnings as they pleased, and cut off sup-
plies of fuel to persons of whom they dis-
approved, thus condemning them to eat their
food raw, and have power to suspend all the
machinery of civilisation when they felt
inclined. In fact, the worst form of land-
monopoly would not be a patch on the pro-
posed coal monopoly, for there is no
quite authentic case in which one mono-
polist or one close corporation of mono-
polists owned all the land, and there
was always a certain competition among
members of the squirearchy. There are other
schemes for putting the control of industries
iu the hands of small corporations of
workers—close corporations into which no
one will be admitted from outside save by
the consent of those inside —but the pro-
posed coal corporation would control all others
and be the key to everything. It would be
the supreme council of grand dukes. And
if it could be buttressed by a plan for the
suppression of criticism, as well as the pre-
sent system for the compulsory circulation
of applause, it would be an imposing affair.
But though it may be possible to squash
some of the people all the time, and to sup-
press all the people part of the time, it is
difficult to gaol all the people all the time.
So it would be one of the ironies of history if
the first whole-souled sample of Direct
Action in Australia was directed against
the Direct Actionists themselves. A censor
wlio required every publication to admire
the policy of Garden and Willis would get
himself disliked. Every member of a clique
which monopolised the business of coal-
mining, and doled out coal on its own terms
and at its own price, would get himself cor-
dially hated. In time, probably, he would
be more hated than any member of the Rus-
sian secret police in the bad old days, and
be quite as friendless. A day would almost
certainly come when people of all sorts
would turn out with guns and shoot coal-
miners on sight, and pursue them with
bloodhounds among the hills, and then it
would be as fatal to be a suspected coal-
miner as to be a suspected aristocrat when
Robespierre was around. Or, perhaps, if
no hostile criticism of the Industrial Move-
ment got into print, there might be no warn-
ing of the burst, wherefore coal-miners, in-
stead of making for places of concealment,
might even be overwhelmed in their beds.
THE PROSTITUTION OF CONSTITU-
TIONAL GOVERNMENT.
If Freedom shrieked at a trifle like the fall
of Kosciusko its protest of late years must
have been deafening and incessant. The
war which was waged allegedly for man’s
dearest right has somehow ended with Free-
dom more enchained than ever. No one
will honestly argue that the masses of the
British Empire took up' the sword six years
ago in any sordid spirit: if ever a people
w r ent to war with a splendid ideal in view
the British did in 1914. And yet it is the
British Empire which happens at the moment
to control a majority of the nations that
are struggling to be free. Other Govern-
ments profess to reprobate its treat-
ment of Egypt, Ireland and Persia;
but in their hearts they only wish they were
strong enough to own such things them-
selves. Their past records show it. A
Russian Government, which was no more
predatory, militaristic and absolute than the
Lenin administration has proved itself to
be, was the first modern force to destroy
the independence of Persia; it took the
step only four years after the 1907 agree-
ment with Downing-street that nothing of
the sort would be done by either signatory.
Japan annexed Korea in 1911 after guaran-
teeing its integrity in 1904. And in the
same year France occupied Morocco, and
Italy grabbed Tripoli. A great year was
1911 for international thefts and breaches
of faith, and there is not the least doubt
that the crimes then committed led up to
the master-crime of all. But the inhabitants
of Continental Europe who are now suffer-
ing for those crimes did not suddenly lose
their moral sense nine years ago: and the
British people are no less honest and kindly
to-day than they have been at other periods.
The real blame lies with the politicians,
working through their agents, the diplomats
and the bureaucrats generally. The gov-
erned, who are just as straight-going in the
mass as they are individually, look on at
the performances of their Governments with
vague uneasiness. But they have little
genuine power at any time, and no imme-
diate power in any given crisis. A modern
Government commits its people to a war
or raises M.P.’s salaries with equal disregard
for those who will be required to foot the
bill. The people have escaped from the per-
sonal domination of Emperors only to come
under the tyranny of an organisation which
is often a good deal harder to shift.
The theory <?f modern freedom as sup-
plied by Parliaments is, gf €ours«, beyond
criticism. It is clearly right that neither
nations nor individuals should be given a
free leg to endanger the comfort or security
of others. To that extent- all, from the
citizen who abides by the laws to the nation
which refrains from subsidising piracy, are
in a bondage that they should welcome. _ But
there are flaws in the arrangement for limit-
ing freedom, and one of them is the ease
with which it can be exploited. With the
world-war raging, and with Germany aim-
ing at India, it was no. doubt necessary
that the British should occupy Persia. But
with Germany beaten and the Ottoman Em-
pire in ruins, there is no valid reason why
any outsiders should remain in a country
which fears nothing so much as the present
fate of Egypt. Egypt enjoyed a shadowy
hope of nationality before 1915. Even the
Irish looked forward to an English evacua-
tion once. The suppression of these nations
has never been decreed by a unanimous vote
on the part of the common people of Eng-
land—that is, of the real England. Ireland
is the only one of the three whose destiny
has ever been put to a vote. The vote on
the Home Rule issue was always recorded
under an extremely limited franchise; and
yet of late years it has consistently favored
Ireland’s desires. It is the higher British
politicians, either under the influence of
cosmopolitan financiers, or emulous of the
vain-glorious Hebrew who made his queen
an empress, that have been responsible for
extinguishing the natural aspirations of the
weak. The minor iniquities are mostly
attended to by their underlings. Australia
has only just begun to have dependencies;
and it is too early yet to estimate our rulers’
attitude towards them. But those rulers run
remarkably true to the old-world type in
other directions. Take their handling of the
War Precautions Act. The principle behind
this measure was, as usual, unassailable. The
nation was in danger, and the liberties of
the people had to be sacrificed temporarily
to frustrate the traitorous and the disaf-
fected. One of the Government interpre-
tations of this duty was a censorship which
interfered in the pettiest details of the citi-
zens’ private business, and which punished
many of those who were suspected of hos-
tility to the political party in power. The
Federal Taxation Commissioners failed the
other day in a raid on the N. S. Wales
totalisator dividends, but they successfully
followed up a V.C. winner in respect of the
profits earned by his farm in his absence
on service, and they now propose to dis-
allow a rebate to those employers who paid
their employees’ salaries while the latter
were in the Army. Censors, taxation com-
missioners and similar officials do not con-
sider the liberty of the public or the equities
on such issues: their whole duty is to their
bosses, the Ministers. The Ministers only
consider the public as an institution to get
votes out of triennially. For the rest they
are well content to use their censors to dis-
cipline opponents of the party; their tax
commissioners to enable them to show a
leaping revenue to the credit of the party,
and so on. In a like spirit the late Czar’s
Secret Police dealt with Nihilist suspects,
while the Imperial tax-gatherers went
through the moujiks for their savings. The
main practical difference between the two
systems is that we call ours deraoernev.
* s « *
At the root of all such abuses is Party
Government, itself a tyranny among tyran-
nies. It has been elevated by those who
live on it into a sort of bastard religion, so
that a man who leaves his party, for how-
ever high a motive, is regarded as a rene-
gade and a backslider. The very section
which he joins is disposed to be apologetic
about him. Gladstone never recovered the
friends he lost when he became a Home
Ruler: Chamberlain was sneered at, to the
last, for deserting the Radicals; Churchill
is still a turncoat for leaving the party in
which he chanced to be born, and doubly so
now that circumstances appear to be driving
him back to the Tory fold ; in Australia W.
M. Hughes and Cook are rats; Henry
Willis, of N. S. Wales, ruined himself poli-
tically when he lost his party a vote by
becoming Speaker; and Levy, the present
N. Speaker, has probably doomed him-
self by a similar action. Where office de-
pends on a majority of supporters in Par-
liament the party chiefs must exercise this
rigid, not to say degrading, discipline or
endanger their billets. The rank and file
must vote as they are told, regardless of
principle: the staff—the permanent offi-
cials attached to the Departments—
must also be loyal to their chiefs, and demon-
strate it by showing results. Such a form
of government necessarily pays little atten-
tion to the rights of minorities. The wonder
is that, under an arrangement which gives
Ministers such power over their dependants,
and which gives the dependants such oppor-
tunities to shield behind the tremendous
word government, Freedom should be as
little curbed as it is. But the position is
bad enough. Some day the electors will
wake up to what is happening, and insist
on their laws being administered by the best
in Parliament, irrespective of their pliancy
as party men and of their sectarian or social
status. Not till then will the Parliamentary
representative become what he should be—
the servant of the public instead of its
master, and often its irresponsible master.
FOOTPRINTS OF GREAT MEN.
Is there anything that a travelling politician
can’t inquire about with a view to publicity?
Premier Theodore, of Queensland, is just
now lumbering round the world —lumbering
heavily like the Jumbosaurus before the
Deluge—asking questions expensively about
cotton.
Mr. Theodore discussed cotton-growing with Mr.
Hunter (Agent-General). Subsequently he told a
representative of the Australian Press Association
that Queensland would now take up the matter
seriously. He had no doubt that steps to establish
the cotton-growing enterprise would be undertaken.
.... During his visit to America Mr. Theodore
investigated cotton-growing in California... .His in-
vestigations convinced him that it was tolerably
certain Queensland could make cotton-growing a
success.
Mr. Hunter, Agent-General, who is making an
investigation in Lancashire... .has in hand negotia-
tions with reference to the encouragement of cotton-
growing In Queensland b/ guarantee of purchase
An expert committee is now dealing wfth the
subject.
And “the subject” hangs fire indefinitely
while these two learned elephants shake the
earth with their investigating feet, and pose
as vast men struggling with vast problems.
Queensland began exporting cotton as far
back as 1861. With the aid of a bonus it
sent away about 10,000,0001 b., which was
at least a beginning, and the produce was
declared in England to be better than the
U.S. variety. The bonus was stopped in
1874 and the industry stopped. Nobody put
on a tariff or did anything else to create
local cotton factories. The world’s supply
was ahead of the demand then, whereas
there is now about four times the old demand
without a corresponding increase of supply.
When Queensland began to experiment cot-
ton fetched a very few coppers per lb., and
was reckoned a cheap, slave-nigger job, be-
cause the United States, which furnished
five-sixths of the British supply and most of
the world’s supply, still had slave niggers.
Now it has rather expensive free niggers,
and as it has greatly increased its output the
business has .become of necessity black and
white. If the black man wasn’t there it
would be pure white. Incidentally, the price
of cotton has gone up about 400 per cent,
since Queensland dropped out of the busi-
ness and took to hard borrowing instead, and
the industry has become too valuable to be
wasted on niggers.
There is no need for any hefty Queensland
politicians to leave big footmarks through
the white State of California seeking news
about cotton. Queensland was in that line
before California was, and produced a better
article than California ever did. But the
U.S. had a tariff which closed the door with
a bang on foreign cotton goods and led to
the establishment of local mills which gave
the industry a local market to fall back
on, and Queensland hadn’t. Nor is there
any need to hold large discourse with men
of tonnage in Lancashire about finding a
market for Australian cotton any more than
there is to call at the Bank of England
to make sure that ,T. Bull will take Austra-
lian gold should we happen to dig up the
article. Not only is the world crying out
for the material at high prices, but Australia
doesn’t v/ant to do any trade with the outer
world—Lancashire or any other part—for
quite a while yet. It wants first an agri-
culturist with the energy of Adam the
first digger to put in the crop, and then a
builder of the calibre of Nebuchadnezzar
or thereabouts to run up the factory, and an
engineer of the pyramid-constructing sort
for vim to make the machinery. Then, ac-
cording to the figures for 1919, its job is to
make £766,225 worth of its own cotton
stockings, and £7,000,000 or £8,000.000 of
cotton piecegoods, and other cotton things
galore. The reason of this is that the man
at the other end has become quite violent in
the way of taking advantage of our helpless-
ness, and this is the way his bill has been
running up of late: —
Some Australian Imports.

Population didn’t increase much, owing to
the war and other causes. Man didn’t
become a centipede or woman a spider to
wear four times as many socks as before.
And the suspension of hostilities on Novem-
ber 11, 1918, nearly halfway during the last
year quoted, didn’t give time for a really
heroic rush of new imports by the succeeding
June. It was in the main plain profiteer-
ing, and the growing of raw cotton for ex-
port won’t stop that any more than the
growing of raw wool for export does.
* * * *
The United States, where the industry is
at least partly white, still produces more
than half the world’s cotton, though only 15
of its 48 States are in the business. Its
biggest producer is Texas, which was never
distinctively nigger. Half a world of nigger
States—lndia, Ceylon, Fiji. Nyassaland,
Uganda, British East Africa. North
Nigeria. South Nigeria, Gold Coast. Sierra
Leone, Gambia, Jamaica, Egypt, Barbadoes,
and a dozen more—are required to produce
the other half or less than half. This seems
to suggest that it is a case of the less nigger
the more cotton.
CHEAP AS SARDINIANS.
Like rays through a burning glass a circle
of hot sunshine falls on the bunk, and
through the porthole comes a perfume of
Japanese erffpe and the frenzied yelling of a
thousand coolies. Coaling in Fremantle
is almost a scientific operation compared
with coaling in Colombo, which is like stok-
ing in Hell, Hell being the only place where
labor is cheaper and more conservative than
it is in Asia.
On the wharf we pass two carpenters saw-
ing a plank. A third sits astride the plank
singing a plaintive song. Out in the street
eight loin-clothed devotees of Siva are re-
moving a smallish packing-case from a bul-
lock-cart, a ninth directs the operation and
a tenth sings a chorus from the “Ramayana’’
epic to spur them on. We are warned
against importing gold coin into Ceylon,
under a penalty of six months’ imprison
ment, or a fine of 1500 rupees, or both. No
sooner are we in the streets than the air
is full of a sibilant whispering. All Colombo
wants to buy gold. The tempters are at
botli your elbows. Your sovereign is the
talisman which will extract anything up to
425. from the loincloth of the raggedest
native. Speculating in exchange appears
to be the staple industry.
Sardinians are cheap. At the post-office
a small boy offers for a fee to lick our
stamps for us. and another small boy, in
expectation of a tip, runs alongside our
’rick, for half a mile singing “It’s a Long
Way to Tipperary.” Even the crows in
Colombo recognise the tourist, and a
horde of black parasites, feathered and
human, beset him at every turn. But the
white residents are just as slave-ridden. A
small bungalow requires seven servants,
and three children demand the inattention
of three ayahs. No self-respecting syce will
look after more than one pony. Swarms of
native runners and minor officials hang about
the doors and corridors of the Government
offices, and listless counter-clerks tumble
over each other in the shops. In the hotels


there are more waiters than guests, with
more waiting than prompt attendance. The
streets are crammed with a feckless-looking
multitude whose activity is antlike; and in
the atmosphere there is a pungent, subtle
odor, as if a giant foot had trod upon the
swarm.
There is tropical luxuriance and tropical
decay even in the bricks and mortar ot
Colombo. Over the newest buildings a grey
mould is creeping and the oldest are splashed
with disease and seem to be crumbling back
into the earth. There is an untidy profu-
sion about the spacious suburbs with their
reminiscence of old Portuguese and Dutch
architecture. The languid native gardener
finds the fight with the jungle too much for
him. In the tropical jungle Nature is
cruel, wasteful and incredibly prolific, and
in the tropical city man lives under the
same law. His religion is blind subservi-
ence to immutable laws and his mental out-
look is a mild pessimism. Only because the
forces of reproduction are stronger than the
forces of destruction does he continue to
exist at all. The vast majority of natives
die without medical aid. and when a paternal
Government attempts to improve their lot
they are apt to riot. The Hindu will not
allow his wells, where the malarial mos-
quito breeds unchecked, to be filled up,
because it would interfere with the practice
of his religion ; and the destruction of plague-
infected rats would be an offence against
caste.
Sardinians are plentiful but not so
cheap as once they were. Immemorial
Asia feels the High Cost of Living, and the
coolie’s rice costs four times more than it
did before the war. The European house-
wife’s monthly wages bill almost anywhere
in India at the present rate of exchange is
£ls to £2O, where but a few years ago it
was barely £3. Shoes are £6 a pair. An
unfurnished house in a residential quarter
costs upwards of £2O a month and is unob-
tainable at that, for wealthy natives are in-
vading the best suburbs and buying the best
houses, a peaceful penetration to which the
original invaders have no reply.
And the Sardinians are no longer as docile
as they were. The anarchic utterances of
President Wilson have stirred the surface
of the dark mass of Asia to a dangerous fer-
ment. The mild-mannered Korean wants
to govern himself, India demands a Consti-
tution, and Ceylon, where the meek gospel
of the Buddha should make government by
au alien autocracy an easy matter, looks for
Nirvana via Wilson’s Fourteen Points.
Ceylon has a Legislative Council which does
not legislate. The votes of the unofficial
members can always swamp those of the
native members. So there is a national
organisation whose demands vary from self-
determination to constitutional reform. The
Governor of Ceylon is on board our ship on
his way to England to advise the Govern-
ment. His dilemma is a complex one. Self-
determination in a Sinhalese village would
be as out of place as a steam-plough in a
rice swamp, but the peasant may be stirred
to any height of fanaticism by the propa-
ganda of his fellow-countrymen who have
assimilated the free culture of the Govern-
ment schools. There is periodic strife
which in 1915 resulted in rioting, some
hundreds of lives being lost. Party govern-
ment in Ceylon would inevitably assume its
wonted aspect, and while native landowners,
capitalists and Kandyan aristocrats fought
for supremacy, the peasant would continue
to scratch the soil, barely existing in the
fat years and starving in the lean. The
lean years might perhaps arrive more
frequently. At the same time, if you make
schools for your Sardinians, thereby creating
an educated class, and allow a public
opinion, unheard of previously in Asia, to
grow, and permit it unlimited expression in
vernacular and English papers, and en-
courage the development of local mercantile
interests and industries, you must take the
consequences. You have struck the fetters
off your slaves. It would be a foolish
bureaucracy that ignored the spirit of the
times, even in its incongruous manifestation
in autocratic Asia, and the British Govern-
ment will probably grant Ceylon some
measure of control of taxation and internal
affairs.
In Roman days Sardinians were cheap,
but in the end they cost Rome her empire.
It is good for Britain that she is a far-
away island inhabited by a virile race which
has no use yet for the labor of slaves. It
is good for Australia that she has an instinc-
tive horror of the corrosion of cheap Asiatic
labor, which eats in a single generation
deep into the European character, and
which, if it were not for the constant in-
fusion of fresh English blood, would in a
few generations dissolve it altogether.
There are 30.000 “burghers” in Ceylon, de-
scendants of the sturdy Dutch colonists.
Their condition is an indication of the fate
of a white community cut off from its
source in the ocean of Asiatic humanity.
And the art of the Sardinians is as cheap
as their labor. We wandered through a
modern Buddhist temple on the outskirts of
Colombo. In its decorations it followed
the edorious traditions of Anuradhapura
and Polanaruwa. Like them it had a
fresco. It was by a local artist and de-
picted the victory of Sak’yamuni over the
five senses. It was unspeakably bad, sophisti-
cated and obscene. When, after some great
cataclysm has wiped out British rule, the
future archaeologist digs down to the 1920
stratum of Colombo, he will discover no
bronzes, like the marvellous dancing Siva
from Polanaruwa. no wonderfully sculptured
terraces, like those at Anuradhapura.
Doubtless he will find some fragments of a
sanitary system, an execrable statue of
Queen Victoria, a heavy gun or two, and
amongst the living natives he may detect
some dim travesty of British law and a
vague recollection of government by caucus.
FENG-SHUI.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The People? the People!
If the Federal enlary job i» eonsummated
in its present form the Opposition-leader in
the Reps, will get another £BOO p.a., Cabinet
Ministers an additional £6OO apiece, and the
Speaker, two Chairmen of Committees, the
President of the Senate and the Opposition-
leader in that Chamber of Mediocrities the
same increase. There is only one Opposi-
tionist in the Senate, and presumably lie
will draw the extra £6OO for leading himself,
but complications will arise if, during the
next three years, an Opposition develops
among the ill-assorted and none-too-friendly
mob wiio follow the Ministry. The case
against the new emoluments is not that they
are excessive, but that they are being made
by a Parliament fresh from a general election
without reference to the people who
appointed it. None of the political groups
mentioned the subject in their wordy mani-
festoes issued five months ago. Every man
who stood for election agreed ipso facto to
work for three years at the old rate, and
every Representative who voted for the Bill
that is “not a Government Bill nor a party
Bill” but a Buccaneer Bill went back on
his agreement with the people; also, he is a
Direct-actionist, a Bolshevik and a tearer-
up of scraps of paper. “It has been urged,”
says Hughes, “that there should be a refer-
endum. When one was taken in S. Aus. the
small increase proposed was rejected by two
to one.” And that, in his judgment, settles
it. Because the referendum went wrong
(according to Hughes’s notions of wrong)
in South Australia, Hughes is against it in
this case. He isn’t going to run the risk
that old John Verran ran. Old John
Verran wasn’t much of a politician, but
he had an honest belief that the referendum
plank in the Labor platform wasn’t put
there for show. Hughes was also a refer-
endum man for about 25 years. When a
straight-out Ministerial decision would have
jeopardised his job he was an enthusiast for
the referendum. After Pozieres he submitted
conscription to a referendum; and after
Passchendaele he took another referendum
on the same subject. The Prime Minister,
in effect, is in favor of the referendum when
it is calculated to compel Bill Coldfoot
and Sam Redrag to fight for their country.
He is against the referendum when it might
deprive him of £6OO a year.

The Inevitable Dr. Arthur and the
Motherly McGirr.
A procession of sorrow and acquainted
with grief—a procession which was a poor
advertisement for the State of N. S. Wales
and the wisdom with which it isn’t governed
—was introduced by the inevitable Dr.
Arthur to Minister for Motherhood McGirr.
It was made up of ill-clad and ill-fed Sydney
women with various-sized families, and in
various stages of hopelessness. There was
the mother of 16 children who could hardly
be all of the dependent age, and the 29-year-
old mother of eight, with £3 17s. 6d. per
week for sustenance, and the mother whose
six children had to sleep in one bed, and
there were other sorts in between. The
wages were good enough on paper save when
the husband was out of employment, probably
as the aftermath of Tom Walsh’s strike or
some similar upheaval. But they weren’t
good enough to live on in a country which
brings its sugar from Jamaica or some such
remote nigger place, and its cotton from the
United States, and its linen from Scotland
or Ireland, and its ironware from the U.S.
or England, and its coffee from Brazil, and
its silk goods from France or China or Japan,
and its paper from Canada, and which has
more alien commercial aristocrats to support
than France or Russia had nobles before
their respective revolutions. The proces-
sion was an aftermath, the result of ■ more
than 50 years of studied dependence on
foreign artisans and foreign financiers and
foreign shipowners and everything else that
is foreign, and it wanted the results of over
half-a-century of thriftless stupidity put right
by a miracle on the spot. It represented
the ill-trained folk in excelsis, and was the
apotheosis of the laborer and the odd-jobber
and the little-skilled. It was the culmina-
tion —or rather the passing evidence, for the
culmination hasn’t begun to arrive yet—of
the frenzieo finance which the inevitable Dr.
Arthur and the motherly McGirr have
always stood for and still stand for, or at
least acquiesce in. New South Wales isn’t
a bad place as places go. Except in a few
almost uninhabited mountain spots, there is
no such thing as cold here —cold as the term
is understood in 95 per cent, of the European
continent. Leaving out everything with
less than 20in. of average rainfall —that is to
say, leaving out nearly two-thirds of the
State —the population is still less than 18 per
square mile, and for the whole State it is
less than seven, whereas there are countries
that try to support 700. N. S. Wales pro-
duces between four and five times as much
coal as all the rest of the Commonwealth
combined, and coal is the thing that counts
in industry. There are quite a number of
rivers, though they flow tnrough the rather
empty country up north, because of the in-
sane policy—itself a feature of frenzied
finance —which aims at stripping the land
bare of people that they may be crowded
into the comparative barrenness of Sydney
and its environs. There would be per-
manent work at £6 or more a week for all
the adult males of the class which the ill-
clad, ill-fed deputation represented save for
two things: (1) The better sort of industries
don’t exist here, thanks to the Foreign-trade
interest which wants to keep the way clear
for imports, and the semi-Bolshevik interest
which wants to keep it clear Tor revolution ;
and (2) the workers haven’t been trained
to such industries. The deputation and its
tale of woe were a whole sermon on the
wreck that can be made of a promising
country by drifting, well-meaning, short-
seeing, hand-to-mouth politicians like the in-
evitable Arthur and the motherly McGirr.
The difference between a politician and a
statesman is that one looks as far as the
next election and the other at least as far as
the next generation.
*
Double Votes for Ministers.
On all finanr .J questions every Minister
should have ffo negative votes —one because
he doesn’t tl.mk the proposal is right and
the other because he hasn’t got the money.
He needs only one affirmative vote; in feet,
*ome Ministers shouldn’t have that. Just
now the Australian Parliament has got the
craze for Philanthropy-at-Posterity’s-cost
very badly. This is a time when, the war
being finished, other nations have mostly left
off borrowing even for the rebuilding of
wrecked towns, and some have gone further
and are doing something in the way of repay-
ment. Australia with another £30,000i000
war loan in view—the name has been
altered, but the fact remains—stands in a
category by itself and manages to make
peace almost as expensive as strife. Next
year the bill for putting people on the land
(to keep them out of the factories that are
so much needed to combat the importer’s
iniquitous prices) is expected to be
£21,000,000, which is £1,500,000 more than
this year's figure. War pensions are to be
£7,000,000 instead of £6,000,000, and if the
importer puts up his prices much higher,
which he will probably do in the absence of
serious local competition, £7,000,000 won’t
go far. Old-age pensions are to go up
£750,000 or so because the patriarch and
matriarch can’t live at the old rate owing
to the cost of imported goods. Because of
the same old importer it is reckoned that
the wages of Federal employees must rise
probably another £750,000. Then there is a
large amount of the soldiers’ gratuity to be
added to the debt, and various other things
besides. The spending alliance is made up
of (1) the debt repudiationists, who wish to
make the load impossible in order to hasten
Bolshevism and smash; (2) the self-adver-
tisers, who are buying votes at Posterity’s
expense for next election; and (3) the usual
handful of neurotic philanthropists. A
robust Ministry might put up a fight if it
had any financial ideas of its own worth
speaking of; and if it possessed 11 extra
votes to say “No” with it might at least
look robust and do something more than
moan, as Cook does, or explode like a fire-
cracker, as Hughes does. Theoretically
there might be something in the idea of
having a Minister for Posterity—an advance
on the idea represented in N. S. Wales by
Motherhood Minister McGirr —to represent
the Unborn, the Payers of the Bill; but. in
practice it is 1000 to one that the Minister
for Posterity would turn dog on his clients
for fear of losing his seat.
»
Sugar at, Is. 3d. a Pound.
Sugar has been put up to Is. 3d. per lb.
(£l4O per ton) in England, because the Gov-
ernment was losing £20,000,000 a year by
selling at lOd. (£93 6s. Bd. per ton), and it
reckoned it just as easy and more logical to
put the difference of sd. on the sugar than
on the taxes. It is a case of relying on the
importer, and Is. 3d. per lb. is the importer’s
price, or the foreign grower’s price plus
freight, exchange and odd swindles. The
Cold Country doesn’t grow its own beet-
sugar as Russia, Austria, Hungary, Germany
and to a less extent France, Belgium anil
Holland do, or they did before the war,
when beet had become the world’s chief
source of supply and cane had dropped into
second place. And between the dense popu-
lation of England, the barrenness of much
of Scotland and the chaos of Ireland it isn’t
likely to become a grower. During the war
the world’s output of beet-sugar dropped by
44 million tons, or more than one-half.
Hence there is famine, and importing coun-
tries have a dark brown outlook. Australia,
like the United States, can produce both cane
and beet, it has been at the cane job
for about 60 years, and it has more acres
per inhabitant to grow the stuff on than any
of its rivals ; but despite its advantages it is
one of the very big importing countries, and
so it may look for sugar at Is. 3d. per lb. or
a little more, for extra distance of haulage
comes in. At present the consumer gets the
goods for less because the Government buys
the Queensland cane crop at a fixed price,
and imports at any old price, and sells at a
loss of many pounds per ton, which makes
things no better though it makes them look
better. If the Government went in for im-
porting clo’ and sold its 14-guinea suits at
10 guineas, and made up the difference by
dog-tax, that would also make affairs look
better. Lately Prime Minister Hughes, in
the fierce pursuit of small game, fixed his
baleful Welsh eye on the Victorian beet-
sugar industry. This was founded by Cap-
tain Cook or somebody, was officially “re-
ported on” 46 years ago, and got so far on
the Government experimental farm 27 years
ago that the yield per ton was vastly better
than that of Germany. Nevertheless, the
industry stagnated, till now, under the spur
of high prices and a big demand and with
the help of a State mill, the yield is 1400
tons a year. Belgium, which is between one-
third and one-half the size of Tasmania,
produced 204,000 tons the year before the
war, though this only ranked sixth among
its crops; but Belgians are not a restful
folk. The Prime Minister proposed to com-
mandeer the 1400-ton crop at £35 per ton,
whereas the State Government is paying
£49 per ton. This would save the Australian
people £19,600, or about Id. each per annum,
provided the industry didn’t die. The
growers say that on these terms it will die,
as they w r ill find it better to grow maize,
and then the Government sugar-mill will
be left a howling waste like Babylon, and
Hughes, who has to import 150,000 tons
already, will have to import an extra 1400
tons at £BO. It is all pathetically futile,
especially for a country of nearly 3,000,000
square miles, with less than two people to
the mile and a reputation for being a land
of energy and of wonderful natural re-
sources, and with so many people shouting
for w r ork that Governments are inventing
loan jobs for them in all directions. Per-
haps there are too many loan works in Aus-
tralia, and too many strikes and stop-work
meetings, and too many fatted and well-paid
Gardens and Tom Walsiies. Anyhow, it
looks like a choice between compulsory work
in many lines, if a compelling force can be
found, or much higher prices than any the
country has known yet.
A Matter of Lunacy.
The N. S. Wales Minister for Health re-
ceived last week a “deputation of ladies
seeking reform with regard to the feeble-
minded.” Two suggestions were put before
the Minister: one was segregation in order
to prevent reproduction, and another sur-
gical interference of such a slight nature
as not to interfere with health, but suffici-
ent to prevent the subjects having children.
The final report of the British Commission
which was appointed to inquire into the rav-
ages of venereal disease has a powerful bear-
ing on this matter. Lord Sydenham and
his colleagues found that “syphilis is exclu-
sively the cause of general paralysis of the
insane; that almost all organic disease of
the nervous system is due to it, resulting in
disorders or loss of speech, loss of memory,
mental enfeeblement, epileptiform convul-
sions.” As an indication of the part this
disease plays in the production of imbecility
and idiocy, “out of pauper admissions to [Eng-
lish] lunatic asylums during the five years
1908-1912 6380 cases were certainly due
to syphilis.” Sir William Osler told the
Commissioners that “a student who was
thoroughly taught syphilis and all the con-
sequential diseases would acquire a good
knowledge of all branches of his profession. ’
The N. S. Wales Minister for Health
gravely promised his visitors that the case
of the feeble-minded would be attended to;
that, in fact, a Bill on the lines suggested
would probably be a feature of the Assem-
bly's first session. He did not mention that
an Act designed, amongst other things, to
prevent the systematic manufacture ot
feeble-mindedness and plain, lunacy has
been on the N. S. Wales Statute Book since
1918, but is inoperative because its procla-
mation will involve the expenditure of
£50,000 on hospital accommodation. Every
day and every hour venereal disease is tak-
ing its toll of the inhabitants, not only of
sinners, who have earned their _ dreadful
punishment in the eyes of the Calvinist, but
equally of children who have done no moral
wrong whatever. Every fresh output of vital
statistics indicates to those who can read
between the lines the new crop of honois
which the community has reaped from its
petted curse. Syphilis “predisposes to cancel
of the tongue and to other infections, not-
ably tuberculosis.” And “it is the cause ot
a large proportion of ante-natal deaths and
deaths in early infancy.” In fact, apmt
from the misery and shame which it is all
the time inflicting on individuals, immoral
and otherwise, this master-disease is
perpetually costing the State as much m
hard cash, day by day, directly and indi-
rectly, as the war did which has just ended.
And the politicians prattle affably about
segregating or sterilising the feeble-mindei •
while they jib at outlaying on the only real
solution of this question a sum of money
far less than will be spent by the Treasuiy
on the coming royal visit!
♦
The Broken Hill Strike.
The N. S. Wales Government has at last
decided that the Broken Hill strike has
lasted long enough—it is just a year old
and the Board of Trade is to inquire into
it The time has, however, passed for going
into the merits of the dispute. The miners
chose their weapons. They would have no
truck at all with arbitration. The proper
work of the Board is, therefore, to inquire
not into the merits but into the chances ot
the miners winning. It should tell the men
—confidentially if that course is preferred
—what a body of impartial inquirers think
of their prospects. And after that the Gov-
ernment should insist upon a secret ballot.
It was laid down long ago that a union
must decide which it is going to trust to—
arbitration or the strike. If, after a union
or a body of unions has tried the strike
and failed, it is to be given the benefit ot
arbitration, industrial unrest will be encour-
aged Unions will naturally say : Well, let s
try a strike first. If that doesn’t get us
what we want, we’ll still have the other
thing to fall back on.” It is greatly to be
desired that the Broken Hill strike shall be
ended. But it should not be ended in such
a way as to promote strikes in the future.
The Bench and the Bar.
“Ace E.” on “The Bar and the Bench” (B.
6/5/’2O) : —-
“A Lawyer” argues that training and practice as
a lawyer are not good training for a Judge, and
that our whole system of supplying the Bench should
be changed.
A knowledge of human nature as it is around us
to-day is assuredly vitally important in the adminis-
tration of justice. Let us see, then, how such
knowledge is to be acquired. I maintain it is
purely the result of experience. Human nature can-
not be reduced to mathematical proportions and
measured by a footrule. It cannot form the subject
matter of a definite study. A man’s knowledge of
human nature grows with his experience of affairs
and men and women, and in what sphere do more
opportunities for this experience occur than in a
lawyer’s practice? A lawyer gets very much to the
heart of things. He gets to know the innermost
secrets of the persons with whom he daily deals.
He meets them in time of stress and sees the re-
action of trouble upon their natures. He knows
about these people much that to the world is a
sealed book. Their domestic infelicities are un-
folded to him. Sordid stories of unrealised hopes,
of disappointments, jealousies, infidelities and the
like —particularly as revealed in divorce practice—
are part of the day’s work. He sees the innate
pettiness of some and wonders at the nobility of
others. He gets to know full well the immorality
of mercantile affairs and the ends to which man-
kind will go to obtain money. Moreover, in crimi-
nal matters he listens to sordid stories of moral
depravities of all sorts. If with these opportunities,
coupled with the ordinary opportunities that occur
to every man to find out something of human nature,
a lawyer does not get some real insight into human
nature, he should go down on his knees and pray
to his gods for the gift of perception, for to him
the doings of universal humanity are written iij
hieroglyphics which he cannot read.
“A Lawyer” seems to think his kind are devoid
of all appreciation of moral obligations. Might I
point out to him that the Chief Justice of one of
our States was offered a judgeship by a Government
of which he was a member and refused it on that
ground? A well-known K.C. was recently offered
a judgeship in a Supreme Court and refused it on
the ground that his training had been that of an
Equity lawyer, and he was not conversant with
criminal courts and their procedure. This is. some
evidence of the standard of judicial morality in Aus-
tralia. We are not concerned with England or other
countries.
In conclusion, as a practical lawyer, more con-
cerned with everyday affairs than with legal arche-
ology, after a thorough perusal of what "A Lawyer”
has said, I flatly don’t know what he wantß and I
don’t think he does. I would be pleased if he
would outline a suggestive scheme for the amend-
ment of our judicial system. This would give us
something concrete to talk about.

Sow Decentralisation is Done.
TftE condensed story of the N. S. Whies
Government's biggest effort at decentralisa-
tion :
If the Dubbo-Werris Creek cross-line was finished
it would make a new connection between the West,
where the drought lives, arid the Northern Rivers and
Tableland, where agistment for starving stock and
supplies of fodder can, as a rule, be found. This
connection would be fully 350 miles shorter than
the present one round by Sydney. The saving in
time, money and rolling-stock would be eVen more
than it looks, for the traffic would avoid the most
congested tracks:
But it would take a little trade away from
Sydney—artificial trade, the very existence Of which
is a loss to the country. Besides, a new town
might grow at the junction: So the Dubbo-Werris
Creek line was started that the GtoVermrient might
pose as an enlightened deoentraliser, and it was
stopped after covering about two-thirds of the
distance. The effort finished in April, 1918, when
the Dubbo-Merrygoen section was opened.
All the same, just to prove that it wasn’t want
of money that was the trouble, the Government
announced last year that it was working hard on the
Craboon-Coolah branch in the same vicinity. This
is a stump or dead-end line which doesn’t reduce
the distance to anywhere, and which doesn’t divert
trade from Sydney. Also 467 other miles of line
Were under construction, all bringing trade direct
to Sydney. That made 491 miles under construction
in all. But the 70-mile gap on the Werris Creek
section remains.
The charge is one of deliberately bringing
disaster on the country in the imaginary
interests of Sydney. .And the sentence is
that the Government responsible for the
crime deserved all it got.
The Rotten Idea that Poverty is a
Disgrace.
The N, S. Wales Minister for Girlhood took
less than 48 hours to begin putting expen-
sive frills on his proposals for the relief of
distress. At first it was suggested that
where the wage was less than £0 per week
and the dependent children numbered more
than two, an allowance should be made for
the extra offspring. Promptly the Minister
amended the proposal to apply to all cases,
no matter what the income might be, in order
to “rid the scheme of any suggestion of
pauperism.” Australia owes six or seven
hundred millions more than it did when old-
age pensions were first invented. It has
acquired a sorrowful army of cripples, and
it has some seven millions a year to pay for
their support. And many other things—all
bad things—have happened since 1901 or
1902, including a slump of 00 per cent, in
the gold yield. Theoretically, perhaps, a man
with £6OO or £lOOO a year has as much right
to the old-age pension and the baby bonus
and the children’s allowance as one with
£156. Theoretically, the rich man may
have a right to free hospital treatment, a
bed in the Benevolent Asylum, or a dole of
victuals if he likes to claim them. Possibly
the living should even have funerals so that
the panoply of woe won’t necessarily imply
the unpleasant, invidious fact that the de-
ceased is dead ; and for the same reason all
tombstones should be of the same size. But,
however noble may be the motives of any
Minister for Second Childhood, this land can
no longer afford frills on the scale of the
golden days. Instead of spending his time
in fashioning them and fastening them on
he would be much better occupied in root-
ing out the snobbish idea that poverty is of
course a disgrace. Sometimes no doubt it
is; very often it is a virtue. Labor Minis-
ters at any rate might be expected to insist
upon that, instead of adopting measures
which imply that poverty and discredit run
together.

The Military Bureaucrats.
“Rio” : How is it that so many gross inac-
curacies get into announcements made on
behalf of the Defence Department?
The latest, which can hardly be acci-
dental, is General Ryrie’s (S.M.H.,
20/5/’2O) “all ranks of the permanent
forces were receiving better treatment
than they had ever received before,” and
“every member of the permanent forces had
received an increase of at least 40 per cent,
compared with 1914.” The statement is
simply untrue. The pay of lieutenants up
to six years’ seniority (who form the majo-
rity of our officers and include many mar-
ried men with children) is the same now
as for the last 20 years, and no commis-
sioned rank whatever has received a rise of
even 20 p.c., let alone 40 p.c. In fact,
although hotel and other expenses have enor-
mously increased in the last 10 years, the
travelling allowance for junior officers was
lately reduced from 12s. 6d. to 12s. per
rliem. God and the Defence “heads”-alone
know why! So that those concerned are
actually worse off than in 1914. In this
connection it is interesting to note that the
Department has lately drawn officers’ atten-
tion to the regulation holding them respon-
sible for any information given to friends
which gets into the press, and this although
the matter may be quite true and it may
be in the interests of the country that it
should be made public. Now, the Official
Secrets Act protects the Department against
any disclosures which are really detrimental
to the nation’s welfare. Of what use, then,
is the regulation except to cloak Depart-
mental injustice or inefficiency? It has been
shown again and again in the last few years
that such regulations have no other effect
than to shield incompetence and prevent pro-
gress. They do not strengthen discipline but
weaken it. If administration is sound what
has it to fear from publicity, and why are
secrecy and star-chamber methods necessary
wdth regard to matters not covered by the
Official Secrets Act? I believe the present
heads of the Defence Department are men
of integrity, but if one of them were not
he could use the regulations to cover all
sorts of favoritism and injustice; and the
inaccurate utterances above referred to
seem to show that the various branches of
the Department do not know of each other’s
doings, but only become aware of them
through the press. Of course, it will be said
that aggrieved officers have a prescribed
method of complaint; but everybody knows
that it is a hard thing to get this channel
used, if only because the protest in nine
cases out of ten goes to the very officer whose
action is appealed against, while represen-
tations by a number are forbidden. An inde-
pendent arbiter of some kind is wanted, and
it is time that the Defence Regulations,
which are mostly a “Chinese copy” of King’s
Regulations, many of them obsolete or con-
temporaneous with the law under which men
were hanged a century ago for forming trades
unions, were thoroughly overhauled by a
competent board and brought into concord
with modern military methods and Austra-
lian ideals.
♦
Bolsheviki.
A brief summary of Bolshevikland based
on a new book, “Russia in Rule and Mis-
rule”:—
There was no dissension in
the ranks, no argument
against the power of the dic-
tators. When anybody be-
came dangerous he was
branded as a counter-revolu-
tionary and shot. There is
no system of public justice
in Russia; the law courts are
closed; the churches are
closed; the priests have been
butchered; Christianity, though
not forbidden, is discouraged
a s counter - revolutionary.
There is no public postal,
telegraph or telephone ser-
vice. The press is not cen-
sored, but if anybody pub-
lishes anything against the
present regime he is taken out
and shot. Personal liberty
does not exist. There are no
elections of any kind, and the
people have no voice in the
government. Criminals are
free from ai rest; the Red
Guards lack nothing; clever
agitators are making a good
living; men who were fail-
ures in life before the revolu-
tion have risen to high places
through their fervent adher-
ence to the new order.
When one comes to think
of it, nobody hears
much election news
from Russia—not since
the Constituent As-
sembly, in which the
Bolsheviks were a min-
ority, met on January
19, 1918, and was chased
off the premises on Janu-
ary 20. In fact, no one
ever heard of Ulianov,
alias Lenin, and many
“HULLO, DIGGER!"
other names, or Leber Braunstein, alias
Trotsky, being elected definitely by anybody
save themselves. It wasn’t the effete and
corrupt monarchy that they rose against, for
that was gone months before they appeared
on the scene, and they had no share in pull-
ing it down ; but they made a monstrous hash
of the new republic. Yet there is this
fascination about Bolshevism—it offers a
career for men whom neither a monarchy
nor a republic has any use for. Leber
Braunstein’s record was that he had been
chased out of two empires (Russia and
Germany), one Parliamentary kingdom
(Spain) and two free republics (France
and Switzerland), and he was under suspicion
in a third republic (the United States). So
various sorts and conditions of men tended
to the view that Braunstein-Trotsky was
little good to man or beast. Bolshevism
alone gave him the chance to make himself
a star actor. Nobody has any reason to
complain of a Lenin-Tbotsicy Government
when its own people don’t complain, and if
complainants are shot and editors who pub-
lish their views die suddenly, contentment is
assured and may be taken for granted. The
Queensland Labor Executive, a small body
the origin of whose authority is none too
clear, expelled Higgs, M.H.R., without a
hearing; with the powers of its counterpart
in Russia it would have shot him without
a hearing instead. He had gone back on
no Labor principle, but he had criticised the
methods of the handful of Grand Monarques,
and they passed on him promptly the extreme
penalty in their power—disqualification, de-
privation (if possible) of his political liveli-
hood, and victimisation for life. The ex-
treme penalty is the only one ever imposed
by offended Trotskies. Then, by way of
another point of resemblance, a scheme has
been mooted in Australia whereby the harm-
less, necessary compositor shall not be allowed,
under penalty of expulsion from his union
and deprivation of his means of livelihood, to
put in type anything that the Trotskies
disapprove of. That, of course, is meant as
a temporary device, pending the time when
nothing that they disapprove of will be
offered to the comp, to set up because the
writer will know better —or else be dead.
The Russian idea that criminals are exempt
has its counterpart in the Australian idea
that the I.W.W. arsonists, having been thrice
found guilty, should be set free, and “com-
pensated,” and rewarded, and given a sort
of Roman triumph and possibly sent into
Parliament. The policy of dispensing with
the popular vote is duplicated by the policy
of declaring a strike at a small, packed meet-
ing and refusing a ballot of the union mem-
bers. In fact, Bolshevism is much the same
the world over. In its large developments
and its small ones it has mighty little use
for the people.
“Isobar”: The par. (B. 6/5/’2O) re the
belated advice of approaching storms which
occasionally blow the whiskers off North
Queensland was singularly well timed, as
the mail steamer Bingera, Brisbane to Glad-
stone, on May 7 was actually receiving wire-
less warnings of an “approaching” disturb-
ance while rolling amid tremendous seas
close to the heart of the
cyclonic gale. The Bin-
gera left Brisbane at 8
a.m., and was advised by
wireless, while plunging
off Sandy Cape at 2.30
p.m. on the same day:
“Storms and squally,
southerly over S.-E. and
eastern entrance to Bass
Strait, squally also over
S.-W. coast with mod-
erate seas elsewhere.” As
the locality named was
about 1000 miles away,
this piece of information
was very useful. Later,
another message was re-
ceived reading: “Tropi-
cal disturbance of mod-
erate intensity operating
N.-E. from Townsville.
Movements not yet appa-
rent.” This was also
heartening, as it showed
that the weather-man
was getting warm on the
track, and that it was
officially recognised that
the pandemonium the
ship was fighting through
was not a pampero off
the River Plate. At
midnight the Meteorolo-
g i ca 1 Department got
red hot and announced
that the disturbance was
N.-E. from Mackay, at
which the Bingera gave
three cheers and hove her-
self through the smother.
The lesson to learn from
this and numbers of other
unlocated blows that have
wandered about the ocean
off the coast of North
Bananaland for days, is
that these storms come from the north-east,
that the Department has no observing station
out there, that until it has one these storms
will continue to arrive unannounced by the
prophets down south; and, finally, that the
suggested Willis Island wireless station
offers just the necessary relief.
“I have a perfectly clear conscience as to
what I did,” wrote Keith Murdoch last
week in response to remarks made about
him in General lan Hamilton’s just-pub-
lished book. “I went to London, and hit
Sir lan Hamilton as hard as I possibly
could. The British Cabinet recalled him
within a week of my report being discussed
by it. He was not again employed.”
Murdoch did not know the elements of
military science in 1915; nor, probably, does
he now. Most of the younger war-corres-
pondents passed through a stage which was
well put in another connection recently by
an English woman-writer :
Mary is just now going through the phase of
knowing better than anyone else. She is contra-
dictious and argumentative to a degree that is
positively distracting to everyone about her. So the
poor child gets a good many snubs and rebuffs—
there is really no other way of dealing with her.
Poor Mary, aged anywhere between 12 and 16, the
awkward years for boys and gills alike!
But descriptive journalists are not snubbed
by modern politicians; and so there was
presented the odd spectacle of the young
writer from Australia being “put through
a thorough cross-examination in London” by
Sir Edward Carson as to Hamilton’s
quality as a strategist. The K.C. had, it is
true, displayed a certain virtuosity as a
leader of irregulars in Ulster just before
the war began; but, on the whole, he can
have possessed no more expert knowledge
of the art of war than Murdoch did. Their
interview must have somewhat resembled the
struggle of a Laplander to discover from a
Finn the inner meaning of the row in Papua.
Yet Murdoch’s clear implication is that on
such testimony General Hamilton was, pro-
fessionally speaking, ruined. If it was so
the generals deserve a good deal more sym-
pathy than the foot-slogging Digger, envious
of their motor-cars and luxurious billets,
ever accorded them.
When John Storey was electioneering with
the loud pedal down he declared that when
he got into power there would be no unem-
ployed, but a scarcity of workers. “Our
activities,” said Bombastes John in one of
his inspired moments, “will only be limited
by the supply of labor.” Now he is in power
—much more so than liis small majority
suggests, for the opposing parties lack dis-
cipline. The drought is no worse and the
loan market is no worse and the revenue has
improved. Yet the unemployed have got
down to the absurd pass of calling on the
Governor for work, and John’s Ministry is
enlisting cinema-men to drum up subscrip-
tions, and John himself has proposed daily
prayers for rain. It all points to that dis-
honesty of politicians for which the party
system has been mainly responsible. Instead
of being enlightened by listening to alleged
leaders of the people, the people nine times
out of ten are in greater darkness, because
the leader, who is merely angling for votes,
tells only what he thinks his hearers will be
glad to hear. Aristocratic government was
a curse because it bred sycophancy. Demo-
cratic government will have to change its
ways, or it will breed a sycophancy more
dangerous still.
Victoria and N. S. Wales are busy throw-
ing the dead cat of obloquy to and fro over
the fence, and S.A. helps with its more
distant cat. The big State says that Vic-
toria, which is better off for wheat and
fodder and promised a supply, isn’t sending
it along with reasonable speed, and the
small one replies that it is a cold winter
in Melbourne, and because N.S.W. coal
doesn’t arrive save in driblets the Govern-
ment has had to commandeer the supply
and dole it out in mere handfuls to a chil-
blained population. S. Aus. says it is doing
the same, only more so, and that for want
of fuel its cement, furniture, machinery,
clothing and other industries are famishing.
The other day 1194 full Victorian trucks
(about 11 per cent, of all the State pos-
sesses) were stranded at the border, and
some of them had been there almost long
enough for grass to grow on them, waiting
for the foodstuffs they carried to be shifted
to the different N. S. Wales gauges. On
the other side an army of Cornstalk trucks
with coal and sundries was similarly wait-
ing. Thus the frantic effort to swap coal for
wheat and fodder on that silly old broken-
gauged border has produced a paralysis
which makes a truck only about one-half
of a truck for working purposes, and this
at a time when it wants to put on a spurt
and be a truck and a half.
The debate on the salary grab in the
Reps, last week was humorous for the
almost unanimous desire to cut the cackle
and collar the cash. The only people who
spoke at length were Hughes and Gabb,
and the latter merely occupied time in
reiterating his refusal to value his services
at more than £6OO a year until the elec-
torate reappraised them. Considine reckoned
the screw was enough for him, but he was
going to take the rise in order to increase
his contribution to the illegal Broken Hill
strike. Gregory and Bell hated the prin-
ciple of the thing, but were going to collect,
whereas Bruce called the whole business a
bit of sharp practice and characterised
some of the arguments as despicable. Bam-
ford, on the other hand, was surprised at
members’ moderation, and instanced the
Paradise at Buenos Ayres where each mem-
ber gets £l5OO and a separate room and
typist, though if the S. Americans follow
the Australian precedent they will make it
£2OOO, two typists and a suite first thing
after next election. The entertainment was
frequently embittered by the gibes of Lamond
and Blundell, two ex-Laborites who have
snuggled down on the bosom of Liberalism,
but the concerted baiting of those who dis-
liked the dishonesty was not more shameless
than the overflow of joy at 3.30 a.m., when
the Bill passed all stages, and members
bawled their victory in the lobbies. One
chorus sounded like: “Another little bit
won’t do us any harm.”


A strong, virile nation needs strong, virile
tasks on which to bend its energies. The
Iron and Steel Industry opens up such a
field of endeavor for Australian Manhood,
providing work that develops and fosters
self-control, initiative, stamina and force
of character.
The Australian
Iron and Steel
Industry
would give employment at Australian rates of pay (if
all the Iron and Steel goods imported into Australia
were made by our own people) to not less than
30,000 MEN,
who would earn over
£5*000,000 per year.
POLITICAL
POINTS
The war has cost Britain about
£11,000,000,000. This amount includes
£2,000,000,000 advanced to Allies and cubs.
Nearly a fourth of the £11,000,000,000 has
been paid out of taxation, and £534,000,000
more is to be wiped out that way in two
years. The war has cost Australia about
£322,000,000. In nine months there has been
a deficit of half a million, which means that
there isn’t enough revenue to pay the sink-
ing fund, and that the sinking fund is being
kept going with borrowed money, and is
therefore a fraud. Australia has introduced
many British follies, but the sane and
courageous finance which distinguishes
Britain—that we never import.
“They asked for bread and ye threw half
a brick at them.” That about sums up
the case of Sydney Labor Council. Unem-
ployed deputations were invading Govern-
ment House and the Ministerial offices.
Intensely pathetic crowds of women were
waiting on Mr. Motherhood Minister McGirr
with the tale of high prices and scarcity
and utter inability to make ends meet. And
the Labor Council took the opportunity to
make a pronouncement against production
by co-operative industry to relieve the short-
age and high prices and supply work;
against production by capitalistic industry
to do the same thing; against the accept-
ance of any profit-sharing offers, however
badly the money might be wanted —and in
favor of revolution at some indefinite date.
It isn’t every prophet who can heal the
sick, but anybody can sool a dog on them.
In 1896, when George Turner was Consul,
Victoria borrowed £3,000,000 and various
smaller sums at 3 per cent, without discount,
repayable in 1917 or any subsequent date at
the Government’s option. The securities are
selling at £6l. Minister Robinson is
now in London besieging Bull about the
renewal of a £6,000,000 4 per cent, loan,
and he expects to have to pay at least 6
per cent., making an annual loss of £120,000.
So Victoria is in no hurry to repay a 3
per cent, debt which isn’t legally due till
Judgment Day. In its own mind it. has fixed
the repayment for the spring of 2693. But
some cheeky holders are biting the Parlia-
mentary ear with a demand that the State
should sacrifice the only streak of luck that
ever came its way, and either repay the 3
per cent, loan or raise the interest to 5
per cent, by way of a gift. They are very
earnest, and their mouths are full of ear,
and they allege a “moral” obligation. The
obvious course is for these people to join
an Anti-Borrowing and Loan Repayment
party, and get. back their money at the
general extinction of the public liabilities.
As the Federal authorities are giving
people free passages to get away from Dar-
win the White Australia hope burns very
dimly for the moment. If the railway was
pushed through so that there would be a
constant coming and going of new people
with up-to-date ideas affairs might be differ-
ent, but in its isolation the place has become
a village peopled by fossils. One set has been
running the Government in the untidy way
that Robinson Crusoe Governments get into.
Another set has been running the labor
unions on the principles of the lone Rhine
baron of olden times who looted passing
travellers, until travellers gave up coming
that way. The establishment of the great
meat concern, worth £750,000.' seemed like
the finding of the carcase of a whale on the
THE SPECULATOR.

face of the waters, and everybody gathered
round for a bite at it and at the shipping
which worked for it. Saints marooned on
Patmos are reputed to get a distorted view
of things and to see visions, and this is a
case in point. It is partly megalomania and
partly parish pumpism.
If Vic. Premier Lawson does not mind
he will have to take the rest cure. His
is becoming more and more a one-man Min-
istry, and it is his own fault. Instead of
deciding matters for themselves colleagues,
either by direction or because of a desire
to share responsibility, go more and more
to him. Predecessors broke down under
such an arrangement; and Lawson will have
to save himself for the bigger problems or
go the same way.
There reached Sydney last week a new
Japanese Vice-Consul, who hastened to re-
mark that Japan was a small country with
a population of GO millions (Australia is a
large country with a population of five
millions), and “could absorb all Australia’s
primary products, particularly food.” Inci-
dentally, the visitor “officially confirmed the
cabled statement that the terms of the new
Japanese alliance would prevent war be-
tween Britain and the United States in
the event of trouble between Japan and
America.” That is something to go on
with, of course; but it might be better for
the peace of the Pacific if the treaty was
so drawn that it would not prevent war
between Britain and Japan in the event of
trouble between Japan and the U.S.A. Cer-
tainly no treaty should ever be based on the
assumption that we could afford to see an
Asiatic Power lick the U.S.A.
The Sydney unemployed question is being
tackled with the vigor of a giant refreshed
in a pawnshop. A lot of men are to be set
building silos with loan money. That job
will last four Some more are to
build the Regent’s Park railway with
loan money. That will last a few months.
The rest are to reconstruct the Parramatta-
road with loan money. This will also last
several months. Then all will start afresh.
The permanent and self-supporting job that
might be based on the fact that 85 per cent,
of our tweed and serge is imported for lack
of local supplies, and imported at as much
as 10s. a yard above local prices, isn’t on
the list.
There is a State office in N. S. Wales
whose job it is to give legal aid to ac-
cused persons; but as it is being operated
at present its chief purpose seems to be to
give aid to lawyers. That a poor man who
has a defence should be helped to put that
defence before the Courts is right enough ;
but where the defence has no merits—where,
in fact, there can be no honest defence —
the State’s money is misappropriated when
it is used to try to fog the jury or 'fool
the Judge and secure an acquittal. Ap-
parently, even in the case of a man who has
had over a dozen convictions, no real in-
quiry is made as to whether he has a solid
defence. If the Government must waste
money there are plenty less dangerous ways
of doing it.
A few Commonwealth salaries: —
High Commissioner in London, £3OOO p.a., and
£2OOO for expenses; Commissioner in the U.S.A.,
the same; First Naval Member, £2500; general
manager Commonwealth Shipping Line, £2500; his
assistant, £lOBO ; Chief Interstate Commissioner,
£2500; his two colleagues, £2OOO each; Chief
executive officer Commonwealth Shipping Line, £2OOO ;
Commissioner of Railways, £2000; Director Bureau
of Commerce and Industry', £l5OO ; Public Service
Commissioner, £1500; Acting Public Service Com-
missioner, £1200; Prices Commissioner, £l2OO.
Half the people have never heard of some
of the gentry and their alleged work, and not
one of them is as useful to his country as
the Auditor-General. But the Auditor-
General draws a mere £lOOO, and hasn’t had
an increase since 1901. His offence seems
to be that he crossed swords with Higgins,
for six years past the wool and metal czar.
The fatted sinecurist has taken care not to
fall foul of Higgins.
Bamfoi’d, M.H.R., remarked in the debate
on the payment of members that “during
the whole life of the Federal Parliament no
one had been accused of accepting a bribe
while a tariff was under consideration. ’
Whereupon Melbourne Argus :
No critic of the vicious practice of settling duties
which is followed here has ever said anything more
condemnatory than Mr. Bamford said. We now
have it upon unimpeachable authority that attempts
have been made to bribe members of Parliament to
induce them to vote for duties.
Apparently the Argus holds that human
nature is not the same tinder a revenue as
it is under a Protection tariff—that an im-
porter of tea or tobacco has a higher com-
mercial morality than a manufacturer of
boots or suits; that in England, for example,
no attempt's have been made to influence
the Budget. Of course, it is idiotic. But,
then, it is the Argus.
The Senate broke up early last Friday
without patching up the row between the
Speaker and the President over Parliament’s
welcome to the Prince. The Reps, passed a
resolution putting its seal on an address of
welcome prepared by the Priminister during
a brief adjournment; and the Speaker
emerged triumphant from the fray, with the
inalienable rights of the “popular Chamber”
untrampled on and only a single Parliamen-
tary how-de-do for the Prince to acknow-
ledge.
One of the suggestions that are to come
up before the A.L.P. Conference: —
That, in the opinion of this conference, the use of
the word farthing in commerce should be abolished,
there being no coin to represent same in circulation.
There are no logarithms in circulation
either, nor does the tram-conductor ever
given one a decimal in change; yet
logarithms and decimals have uses.
Silver is quoted at the moment at ss. 3d.
and seven-sixteenths of a penny, which last
is a farthing and half a farthing and a
quarter of a farthing; and what does the
Labor League think of doing about that?
Strict Parliamentary decorum was dis-
pensed with at the Premiers’ Conference,
and hence it was that Hughes addressed the
States-men between pull’s from a cigarette
on Saturday. Ho busy was lie the previous
day pushing through the Thousand-a-year
Bill that he had not much time to prepare
his brief, but he did not seem to worry
much on that score. He chatted rather
than declaimed, and from the point of view
of the pressman was “easy to take,” as the
new bits were few. His attitude was one
of the tolerance of a senior public schoolboy
towards juniors, especially when he said
something to tickle them. “He’s tough
and devilish fly,” was the comment of one
of the delegates, who improved slightly on
the author of the phrase.
N. S. Wales Treasurer Lang implores
Diggers who receive cash for their gratuity
bonds to invest it in his £2,000,000 loan,
and no doubt some of them will. Bull lends
the money to Hughes, who hands it to the
Digger, who passes it on to Lang, who sends
it back to Bull as part of the Ma State’s
annual interest tribute to modern Babylon.
In this way the N. S. Wales taxpayer pays
two sets of interest on the same money; and
the money was only paper to start with.
Bull places a certain description of paper
at the disposal of Hughes, who thereupon
issues another sort of paper, which the Dig-
ger changes for small printed sheets nicely
illustrated. These he hands to Lang, who
requites him with further printed legends,
and,, having thus obtained (from Bull) the
means of satisfying portion of Bull’s periodi-
cal demand for interest, pays Bull in Bull
paper, and will have to borrow more Bull
paper next year to pay for what he bor-
rowed this year; and so ad infinitum. Mean-
time there is a chilling and persistent de-
crease in the quantity of goods you can buy
with a paper pound.
Barwell, the successor of Peake, an-
nounces that S.A. civil service is “consider-
ably overmanned,” and must be “reorgan-
ised,” which means retrenched. Also, that
if the Government day-laborers are dissatis-
fied with the increases handed to them by
the industrial tribunal, there will be a sud-
den stoppage of dirt-jobs, and Barwell will
do the stopping—which is Barwell’s way of
bidding farewell to the Public Service vote.
A cable mentioned (20/5/’2O) that “a
Danish traveller” had told someone in Copen-
hagen that “Lenin’s programme now in-
cludes the recognition of the right to own
personal property.” Every knowledgeable
writer on Bolshevism during the past year,
from Professor Goode, the Manchester
Guardian special commissioner, to the
French jurist Labry, has proclaimed this
fact. Not only does property exist under
the Lenin system, but the capitalist may
live idly on his rents or dividends —
the catch being that he has to half-starve on
an idler’s food-ration. There appear to
be two main misconceptions regarding Bol-
shevism. One is the capitalist delusion that
under it no one is allowed to acquire any-
thing ; the other, the even more absurd
Socialist delusion that the Russian may
acquire the amenities of life without hard
work.
EXCEL NO MOKE!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The hammer-strokes were falling fast
As Bragg the organiser passed;
With hollow voice he said: “Go slow,
The Union heads would have it so.
Excel no morel”
“A maiden weeps,” a toiler said,
“She wants to share my lowly shed;
Unless I hustle she may slip.”
Back came the cry from curling lip:
“Excel no more!”
Another said: “This head would breed
A fertile crop of useful deed ;
I’d fain invent, if but I might.”
Back came the word: “Now, sit thee tig! t!
Excel no more!”
“I’m young and strong,” another pled,
“I’m sound in limb and sane of head ;
I’d like to double w'hat I do.”
“Ah, would’st thou speed this halting crew?
Excel no more!”
A big man growled: “I’d have you know
It drives me cracked, this going slow;
My heart is stout, my blood’s a-boil
To hear this loafing branded ‘toil.’ ”
“Excel no more!”
A pair of brothers: “Tired are we
Of slavish rules for workers free;
This levellingriip is levelling-down ;
It makes a man a loafing clown.”
“Excel no more!”
A woman wailed: “We’re short of bread ;
Our roof’s a wreck; our troubles spread ;
If but you’d let men do their best
They’d put it right.” “ ’Tis time to rest.
Excel no more!”
And day by day the town decayed
Beneath the blight the madness made;
It had no Cause, it waved no Flag,
Its only slogan came from Bragg:
“Excel no more!”
Above its grave they raised a stone:
“By subtle craft ’twas overthrown;
A poison dire its body bore
That sent it to the Golden Shore—
Excel no more !”

The 1919 surplus in the Ordinary de-
partment is the smallest of any year since
the Australian Widows’ Fund was taken
over. ’Flu was wholly responsible: in the
Ordinary department the claims rate was
06.7 p.c. of total income, compared with
G 0.7 p.c. for 191 S. With the claims figures
given above are included bonuses to share-
holders (£35,158 last year and £32,156 for
1918), and they are so included because
at one time distributions to shareholders
were not shown separately: the old man-
agement apparently feared to disclose the
extent of the bite the proprietors were
taking. M.L.C. policy-holders are on a
different footing from those in a mutual
office. Having the care of an amount of
shareholders’ funds as well as of policy-
holders’ accumulations, the co-operative
management has an additional backing to
policies; so it guarantees (the full face
value of each policy and any bonuses de-
clared thereon —at least, to the extent of
the capital which shareholders have sub-
scribed. Further, this co-operative office
undertakes to manage policy-holders’ affairs
economically, guaranteeing that expenses
shall not exceed a specified rate. In return
for these guarantees the people who give
them ask a one-fifth share of Ordinary profits.
The question arises whether any careful
mutual management could not undertake
the same guarantees and save the 20 p.c. of
profits which go into somebody’s pockets.
On that point this co. has some
convincing evidence on its own premises.
Ten and 12 years ago two highly-respectable
mutual offices —the Mutual Life Association
and the Australian Widows’ Fund—threw
in their lot with the old co-operative office,
and their old policy-holders are still repre-
sented by trustees. Since the two old con-
cerns came in their affairs have been put
on a much sounder basis, and as to actual
£ s. d. results let the Widows’ Fund trustees
testify:—-
The share of cash surplus apportioned to the
A.W.F. section for 1919 amounts to £52,370, and
provides a compound reversionary bonus of
£1 17s. 6d. p.c. This very large bonus continues
to supply a very practical illustration of the great
advantage to A.W.F. policy-holders which has come
about in consequence of the union. The percentage
of cash surplus to premiums received in this section
was over 50 p.c. In other words, the cash surplus
allotted to policy-holders for the year just closed
represents over one-half of the total premiums
received.
The old M.L.A. trustees are equally as en-
thusiastic about the benefits which have
accrued to their policy-holders as a result
of the amalgamation. Of course, owing to
war and ’flu troubles, M.L.C. bonuses are
not what they used to be; but the current
year should see a revival. For 1914, on a
£796,244 premium income, £213,584 of
bonuses were distributed; the 1918 renewal
and first premiums together totalled
£813,693, and from that year’s surplus
policy-holders were credited with bonuses
totalling £256,121. Despite the effect of
’flu on 1919 operations, actuary Miller,
after conservatively estimating liabilities,
was able to unearth a divisible surplus of
£307,151 as at December 31 last, and he
recommends a distribution to policy-holders
which will provide a reversionary bonus of
£2 12s. per £lOO of assurance —the same as
for the previous year—and also give share-
holders their cut. Should the latter
want a little more than they are at present
getting, policy-holders have the assurance
that the management must first earn four
times that bit for them.
Last year exes, absorbed only 7.5 p.c. of
total income, or £ll 10s. of every £ioo of
premium income, which was 12s. more than
in the previous year. The increase was
chiefly due to the larger amount of new
business written during the year:—

1918.. 8,103 2,048,870 203
1919.. 10,407 2,513,795 242
The M.L.C.’s very thorough organisation
made it possible to put the additional 2$
millions of assurances on the books at a
cost of about £59 12s. per £lOO of first-
premiums, calculated by adopting The x>ljL-
letin’s usual reckoning that old or renewal
business costs 7 p.c. and that the balance
of the year’s expenses can be taken as the
approximate cost of lvriting new business.
This new business cost is much lighter than
it was only a few years ago, and that has been
possible partly because the average amount
of assurance per policy written nowadays is
much larger than it used to be, and partly
because, no doubt, along with other traders,
the insurance salesman has lately found less
difficulty in getting rid of his wares..
It was remarked above that the M.L.C.
actuary estimates liabilities to policy-holders
on a very conservative basis. \\ hen as-
certaining what amount should be in hand as
at Dec. 31 last to protect policy-holders, he
calculated on the basis of funds earning only
3 p.c. p.a. in future. Last year, however,
interest earnings were at a rate almost GO
p.c. more than the actuary allowed. Hence,
the £9,440,283 of funds earmarked to meet
estimated liabilities are considerably in ex-
cess of the amount which actual experience
demands. Also the adoption of this con-
servative method of valuation means that
shareholders have voluntarily foregone their
share in any surplus which might otherwise
have been disclosed. They could well af-
ford to forego something, for during the past
year they collected £35,158 in the Ordinary
department, £68,592 in the Industrial (in-
cluding interest on capital), and £1250 in
the employers’ liability branch —altogether
£105,000 in divs. and bonuses on a £200,000
paid capital.

For every £ of income which (he old Citi-
zens’ co. used to collect in its Ordinary de-
partment 13 years ago it handled nearly 16s.
in the Industrial. But things have so changed
since the M.L.A. amalgamated that nowa-
days the Ordinary income is over three
times the size of the Industrial. It is in
this department that shareholders get their
largest bite: a 10 p.c. div. (£20,000) and
£48,592 in bonuses having been pa d during
the past year. Even as managed by this
very successful co. Industrial assurance
comes a poor second. Including dividends,
no less than £45 Bs. p.c. of total income ivas
absorbed by expenses.
The combined balance-sheet of all depart-
ments shows total assets of £15,154,912; but
on the other side there is a huge sundry
creditors’ item of £3,236.831. This is the
result of the directors’ policy of not only
applying current surpluses to the purchase
of War Loan, but also of arranging for ac-
commodation to acquire War Loan for pros-
pective surpluses. Practically every penny
the M.L.C. has accumulated since the first
year of the war has been invested in this
way, and whereas only two years ago about
50 p.c. of all assets was represented by Gov-
ernment securities, at Dec. 31 last no less
than 77 p.c. was in these high-class securi-
ties.

Neither shareholders nor clients of the old
National and Colonial Banks can have any
regrets over the fusion which, effected in
1918, made the new National one of the big
banks. Apart from the Commonwealth Bank,
of the locally-owned concerns only the Wales
and the Commercial of Sydney hold more
of the public’s money, though the English-
controlled Union and ’Asia are also a few
millions in the lead. Certainly, the fruits
of the amalgamation are not visible from a
comparison of the disclosed figures, for the
joining of forces was effected at a time when
the affairs of the world were so disordered
that probably neither of the old manage-
ments was disclosing anything like the full
extent of its net earnings, and, apart for
showing ample to cover dividends, no doubt
both were buttressing their position. But.
combining the figures of the old National
and Colonial, this comparison can be given
for what it is worth: —

1920 . . '377,341 223,185 10,000 144,156
Thus gross profits are £llO,OOO more than
they were six years ago; but a lot of new
capital has meantime been get in. It now
stands at a round two millions: 62,000 fully
paid £lO prefs. and 276,000 £8 ordinaries
paid to £5. Both of the old concerns were
paying 7 p.c. divs. on all shares, but the
amalgamated bank has been distributing
8 p.c. all round. In the introductory table
the amounts absorbed by the two classes of
shareholders are combined, for when the
prefs. receive a further three divs. at the
same rate, under the agreement on which
the amalgamation was effected they lose
their preference rights. Though gross pro-
fits have advanced £llO,OOO, note also that
expenses are £BO,OOO heavier than they used
to be, and there is every likelihood of fur-
ther increases. During the past year bank
staffs have been very restless, and the milk-
and-water in their association has given
place to vinegar, if not to vitriol. The bank
clerk has been driven to the conclusion that
his only hope of bringing some of the stuffy
old directors to a sense of their obligations
to employees is to secure a hearing in the
arbitration courts, and that means regis-
tration as a straight-out industrial union.
N. S. Wales bank officers have already for-
mulated their claims in readiness to make
an appearance before the Court once their
registration is approved, and if the Court
should grant anything like what is demanded
wages-sheets will expand very suddenly. In
Queensland the Arbitration Court has
already spoken, and the changes in wages
and taxes have made a difference to one
Queensland bank of 3 p.c. on its capital.
Combining the figures of the two old
banks as at March 31, 1018, it is possible
to show the progress which the amalgamated
concern has made in each of the years since:

The National thus has £4,811,002 more de-
posits than the old concerns together held
only two years ago. In 1918 the old
National and Colonial had altogether
£20,327,187 of the public’s money, and
showed funds of their own totalling
£2,965,263 —£6 17s. Id. of outside money
for every £1 of their own. At March 31 last
the amalgamated bank had the care of
£24,410,919 of the public’s money, but though
its own funds had expanded to just over 3}
millions it held £7 10s. 2d. of the public’s
money for every £ of its own. This is with-
in what is generally regarded as a prudent
limit, but if the National continues to pro-
gress as rapidly as it has since the amalga-
mation was effected it probably will not be
long before shareholders will be invited to
put up further capital.
From other points of view the bank is
much stronger than it used to be. As the
comparison of assets shows, there have been
big changes over the past 12 months,
advances having been reduced by over 2J
millions and liquid (or what pass for liquid)
assets having expanded by six millions. At
March 31 last no less than 54 p.c. of all
liabilities were represented by liquid assets.
They are not quite so good a lot as they
might be, for nowadays every bank holds a
huge pile of Government lOU’s in its till
.—over half of this one’s liquid assets cop-
sists of Government paper, apart from its
holding of Australian notes—though, of
course, behind that paper is the credit of
the State. But if these “liquid” assets are
not so satisfactory as they might be because
the National pawn-ticket is so much in evi-
dence, from the bank’s own point of view
there is the very satisfying consolation that
nowadays a much greater proportion of its
liquid assets are interest-earning. To meet
the £11,216,759 of liabilities there are the
£13,903,139 of advances and the premises
with a book value of £643,636. Of the
former it can be confidently said that they
are a good lot, for it is less than two years
since the managements of the old banks
closely scrutinised each other’s belongings
and gave them a clean bill of health. The
premises are, no doubt, worth considerably
more than they stand at in the books; and
during the past 18 months alone they have
been written down by no less than £30,000.
Gakbatt’s, Ltd. —This Sydney co., which
sells and repairs motor-cars and accessories,
has been in business 12 years, but its shares
have only recently been listed on ’Change.
It had a bumpy existence for the first _six
years—in 1911 it made a loss of £4855
but the going became easier soon after
Alick McNeil took the wheel. Until its
ninth year no profits left the business, with
the result that, though paid capital was only
£20,552, at January 31, 1917, there were
nominal reserves of no less than £10425 —-
they were only nominal because £4622 of
capital was, and still is, represented by good-
will. The directors thereupon decided that
it was good enough to use some of this
stored-up profit to purchase additional scrip
for shareholders, so a bonus of ss. per share
was declared and called up. Paid capital
has now been built up to £63,678, and for
the past four years ordinaries have had 10
p.c. p.a. divs. out of these net profits: 1917,
£5973; 1918, £7027; 1919, £7039; 1920,
£9623. This shows how funds have been
laid out, and also the progress which has
been made during the past three years:—

The large amount of outside money in the
business as at January 31, 1919, was largely
due to the delayed stocks which poured into
the Commonwealth about that time. Even
now, as the table shows, all but £10,009
of paid capital is represented by goods on
hand. The co. holds the sole agency for the
Italian-made F.1.A.T., and until lately that
car has been off the market. Two years ago
the co. also captured the agency for the
Overland ; and with both these factories now
working full time, and with a big local de-
mand for cars, at least the next couple of
years should be prosperous ones for Gar-
ratt’s. But the expansion of the business
is calling for a lot of additional capital;
about £70,000 is to be spent on providing
new workshops for repairs and body-building.

purchase shares, arrangements having been
made with the Treasury for the co. to cash
the bonds. The concern sttrts with a clean
balance-sheet, for there are no promoters’
cuts, and preliminary expenses are reckoned
not to exceed £5OO. The co. is headed by
Brig.-General Robert Smith, who knows the
business. A very big opportunity is ahead
of the enterprise, and if the co. is fortunate
in its management The Bulletin expects
that in a few years the £lOO,OOO of nominal
capital will be inadequate, and that the
Articles, particularly those portions restrict-
ing share interests to those now participat-
ing in the war gratuity, will be found to be
a hindrance and call for amendment.

That Insurance Act which The Bulletin
has long invited the Commonwealth Govern-
ment to introduce is badly needed just now.
Life business has been so comparatively easy
to write during recent years of artificial
prosperity, and the figures of some young
cos. (notably the Australian Provincial)
have been so remarkable, that a fresh crop
of cos. threatens. Two have ali'eady issued
prospectuses, a thii’d blossoms this week,
and at least one other is contemplated. In
almost any part of Australia anybody can
put out his shingle and commence assuring
the lives of the unsuspecting and collect and
do much as he pleases with the premiums,
which are trust moneys equally with the de-
posits of the savings banks or the estates
administered by trustee cos. Yet no Gov-
ernment would permit all and sundry to
carry on savings banks, though by compari-
son with a life office a savings bank is as
easy to manage as a peanut basket.
The Producers and Citizens’ Co.-op. Assur-
ance Co. of Australia, Ltd., proposes to
ti’ansact assorted life business and to ex-
periment. It is setting out to curtail heavy
initial expenditure by hitching itself on to the
Farmers and Graziers’ Co-op. Grain, In-
surance and Agency Co. —at least, an agree-
ment has been coipe to with that conceim
to employ its agents as business-getters. The
promoters declare that this arrangement
“should in the first year’s operations assist
the co. to secure as. much business in one
year’s work as any co. established for 40
years could accomplish in the same time, ’
and that it “should advance the progress of
this co. by at least 10 years.” Also, “within
six months of flotation the co. should be
working on a profitable basis.” This is not
the first time an effort has been made to
secure the services of people not directly in
the employ of a life office to push its busi-
ness. The Life Insurance Co. of Australia

possesses these and many other advantages over the
old style. It costs but little for current, and re-
quires very little attention to be kept clean and
well tinned. An exclusive feature of this iron is
the spiral coil wire handle, which keeps remarkably
cool, and which may be grasped close to the tip

Bostock’s Violo Polishes, Ltd., Sydney
set out to organise storekeepers to collect
premiums, but the scheme was soon aban-
doned. The present project is more am-
bitious, and its chances of succeeding to
anything like the extent claimed by the pro-
moter's are not good. It is wholly experi-
mental. And for that reason the tall talk
about what other cos. have done with the aid
of specially-selected and trained whole-time
staffs counts for nothing when applied to
this venture. Nominal capital is to be a
quarter-million, and the public is offered
236,000 shares, 4s. per share (£47,200) to
be called up for a start. For introducing
the experiment the promoters are asking
£14,000 in fully-paid shares.
The Australian Benefit Fife Assurance
Society, Ltd., starts with a nominal capital
of £lOO,OO0 —200,000 shares of 10s. each —
of which the public is asked to subscribe
£30,000, ss. per share (£15,000) to be called
up to begin with. For introducing the
scheme to shareholders the promoter requires
5000 fully-paids. The success of the A.M.P.
and M.L.C. are paraded as reasons why
this concern might also be expected to suc-
ceed, and the young Australian Provincial’s
new business figures are set out in large
type. Needless to remark, no mention is
made of the fact that £52,000 of the A.P.A.’s
capital has gone in establishing its busi-
ness, so far as it is established. The Aus-
tralian Benefit Life is, according to its
prospectus, going to specialise in house-pur-
chase policies, by no means the safest or
simplest kind of business for an infant in-
surance co. to handle in times of inflated
values; and there is no evidence that the
directors are specialty qualified for the dif-
ficult job. However, “capital will insure
a full measure of security,” say the pro-
moters; but there are limits to the pro-
tection which can be afforded by £15,000
of paid capital. The 'prospectus makes no
mention of the co.’s intentions of appoint-
ing an actuary to watch policy-holders’
interests.

A daily flying-boat service between Port

Jobbers are anxious to know how much
longer it will be before London checks the
flow of scrip to the Commonwealth. For a time
it was merely a dribble, but ever since the
international exchanges smashed the current
has been swelling. Double taxation helped,
and since the British budget saw the light
the ladling out of scrip has been faster
than ever. B.H. Props, have been heavily
shipped, the variation in prices between Aus-
tralian markets and London offering room
for profits to quick operators.
While the hookworn plague isn’t con-
fined to tropical Australia, since it has been
reported from the N.-E. corner of N. S.
Wales, it seems pretty certain that it does
not exist at either Bendigo or Broken Hill.
Several hundreds of men have been exam-
ined at Bendigo and a bigger number at
the Hill, and the Hookworm Commission’s
experts have found no trace of the worm
at either place.

The fund established by the mining and

vide scholarships and bursaries for mining

were made for Melbourne, Sydney and Adel-
aide Unis., nine budding mining-engineers
and metallurgists participating.

The Westralian Government’s regulations
for protecting the prospector and public
against plundering promoters have been
received with a wild hurrah from the friends
of legitimate mining in the West. They
should have been framed sooner. Instances
can be cited where option cos. have been
formed to acquire good, bad and doubtful
leases from promoters at four and five times
the amount promised the prospector, and
after the sharks had taken their whack
out of the proceeds of the flotation little
was left for working capital and absolutely
nothing,, for the purchase of the properties
in the event of the options being exercised.
This type of promoter provides no capital
to work a mine, but merely transfers money
from the public to a co., and in the process
takes a big bite for himself. The new regu-
lations compel promoters to disclose, before
any lease can be granted, the conditions
under which the public is being asked to
subscribe. They should go further and wipe
out the middleman altogether. Then syndi-
cates of speculators who wish to have a
gamble could be formed with the express
object of getting into touch with prospec-
tors and their holdings. These syndicates
would not be weighted with any vendors’
interests, and should be prepared to work
any property acquired until it is either
proved worthless or promises well enough
to be floated into a reasonably capitalised
venture. There is room in the West for
hundreds of such development cos., but
until the middleman is squelched things will
probably go on much as they are despite
Mines Minister Scaddan and his regulations.
White Hope, the sheet-anehor of Hamp-
ton Plains, has been clawed badly by the
bears. The three original prospecting shafts
were put down on, or close to, the costeens
which gave the best assays; consequently
when connecting these shafts at the 100 ft.
level the poor values experienced in between
and beyond these costeens are again met
with. It is alleged that the three shafts
are in pipes, or on short shoots of good ore,
and that elsewhere the mine is poor. It is,
however, all a matter of conjecture, as no
mining man can tell how the show is going
to turn out until further development has
been done. Another reason given for the
slump is that only one shaft is going down
in the lode, and as the shoot is now‘dipping
out, as it did at the other two shafts, there
will be no values to report, and consequently
nothing to sustain the market until the
100 ft. level is reached and crosscuts put
through the lode. In order to buck up the
market, bulls want the only shaft remaining
in values to be turned from the verti-
cal so as to follow the shoot down, but the
management, which apparently does not
worry about the market, will not entertain
the proposal.
* * * #
Hampton Celebration’s prospects now seem
to hang by the slenderest of threads. Just
below the surface the lode was reputed to
be worth about £6 per ton, and in a cross-
cut at 50ft. assays up to £5 were said to
have been obtained. At 100 ft., however,
little was mentioned about values, leading
to the conclusion that they were not worth
talking about. Since the co. was floated
in London the shaft has gone down another
100 ft., and there is nothing in the appear-
ance of the lode there to create excitement.
* * * *
Edna May Central is said to have its eye
on the old Golden Valley mine, near Kan-
owna. This was worked down to water-
level by a London co. over 20 years ago
and produced a good deal of gold. Subse-
quently it shut down, and the plant was used
for public crushing. Good ore is alleged
to have been left in the workings, but as
they are water-logged money will have to be
spent on pumping. The mine may pay to
re-open, but past experience has shown the
in the district to be treacherous, and
the landscape is dotted with remains. A
number of mines had good returns for a
while, and one or two even paid a few
small divs.
* * * #
Boulder No. 1 (W.A.) is still looking
for a mine. Dozens have been sampled
and turned down during the past 10 years.
The co. is now considering the merits of two
shows on the Murchison, and is also mak-
ing inquiries about a new find recently made
on Block 45, Hampton Plains.

General-manager John McDermott’s esti-
mate of Ivanhoe (W.A.) ore reserves as at
December 31 last is 972,387 tons worth 335.

When John Brandon turned Yates’s molyb-
denite show (N.S.W.) into the Kingsgate,
there were visions of fat divs. within a few
months. But instead, call after call has been
made until there remains only Gd. per share
to be got in. These calls have been
required to pay up the instalments due
to the vendor and to furnish the £23,000
needed to equip the mine properly. Drought
troubles resulted in the year’s work to Feb.
29 showing a net loss of £2741. After all,
this is not too bad a record, seeing that a
lot of low-grade liopperings went to the mill
for treatment. The value of the bismuth
and molybdenite contents of the ore handled
was nearly 745. per ton, of which 16s. slipped
into the tailings dump, and Bs. was lost
beyond recall. The difference in handling
the two minerals is striking, for while the
recovery of bismuth was 83£ p.c. that of
molybdenite did not get above 54 p.c.
Manager J. A. Hulme reckons that when he
gets going on ore picked to a grade of 0.506
p.c. bismuth and 0.831 p.c. molybdenite he
should get an 80 p c. extraction of bismuth
and 90 p.c. of molybdenite. This means a
product worth over 183 s. per ton to be won
at a cost of 89s. 4d., providing bismuth
fetches 7s. and molybdenite 4s. 6d. per lb.
On a 30-tons milling daily he figures out a
yearly profit of about £21,000.

The solid little Sydney syndicate which
has been boring for oi! near Penrith
(N.S.W.) has struck trouble. The hole is
down 2600 ft., but, owing to the prohibitive
cost of materials, casing was not inserted
as drilling proceeded. Since it was thought
that the last of the water had come in
about 1200 ft., casing was eventually put in
to that depth. Water was then 12ft. from
the surface. After four hours’ pumping it
actually rose another 6ft. So now it has
been decided to put in a further 100 ft. of
casing, necessitating the reaming out of the
hole. A further disappointment, however,
is that the additional casing will shut off
the best show of gas met with in sinking.
The syndicate no longer has hopes of strik-
ing a gusher in its present well; it is
merely after a dry sample of gas to ascer-
tain whether it is really from petroleum. If
the analyst says petroleum, then a fresh
bore is to go down to the west of the present
site in what, on the data obtained from past
drilling, seems more likely country.
B. 11. Junction North during the six
months to March 31 received almost £39,000
surpluses on old stocks of concentrates
realised and on settlements completed.
Though practically no productive work was
done in any of the co.’s properties, mine
and plant maintenance, etc., swallowed
£27.790. The result was a working profit
of £7004, which was augmented by £l2OO
or so from investments. But by the time
£4BBO had been written off leases and £1919
off the Junction North mine, a loss of £2198
showed up. Nevertheless, a ninepenny div.
(£8079) was distributed, reducing the balance
of P. and L. to a little £1452. The co.
closed its books with £IB6,GSO of more or
less liquid assets, and owed only £13,372.

The English sheep-dip firm of William
Cooper and Nephews has been negotiating
for the old Ottery arsenic mine four miles
from Emmaville (N.S.W.). This mine has
been idle for over 13 years except for a
spasmodic working of the lodes by the Vic-
torian Leggoes about 12 months ago. Pros-
pecting work in the tunnel has been proceed-
ing for several weeks, fresh lodes have been
located, and the outlook is declared to be
promising.
* * * *
Badak has dropped £15,000 into the Kedah
Government’s cash-box before it knows the
precise size of the area it is to be allowed to
take up. Rumor has it that there will be a
strip of 500 acres left outside Badak’s lease
down to the river, and that it is there Bux
may yet find a home. Meantime director
Scarborough has picked up a 5000-acre con-
cession at Treggenau for both the Bux and
the Jungle, with the right to select 500 acres
from either block. Tin has been hunted in
Treggenau by nearly every prospector of
experience, but nearly all have passed it by
as offering small chances of fortune. In-
structions have gone to Scarborough to make
ready for Badak’s plant, and he also has the
job of picking a reliable boring contractor
to get the drill going systematically.

An effort is being made in Vic. to get
the cement business going again on Maria
Island (Tas.). There is a great mass of
limestone, composed almost entirely of
ancient shells at the north end of the island,
where fossil cliffs hundreds of feet high and
packed with shells (some of them old-time
scallops about a yard across) rise out of
the sea. A company spent a deal of money
to no purpose on the island years ago. The
new crowd, the Maria Island Land and
Development Pty., Ltd., headed by John
Monash, hopes to produce 30.000 tons
cement for a start and later get the output
to 50,000 tons. Coal supplies are to come
from the Speck’s east coast.

High tin prices are keeping Mt. Bischoff
Extended, Waratah (Tas.), afloat. For the
half-year to March 31 a profit of slightly
over £3OOO showed up, the value of crudes
treated being 295. lid. and operating costs
255. The average width of lode stopcd
has narrowed from 11.17 in. to 10.32 in„ and
the yield per ton has dropped from .025 p.c.
tin to a half p.c. Outputs since the term
closed indicate a further drop in grade, and
what with the fall in market prices, labor
demands for another 2s. per day, heavier
firewood costs and rapid depletion of ore
reserves, the show’s days seem numbered.
Negotiations for a supply of cheap power
from the Bischoff came to nothing.
* * * *
A 15ft. lode grading 5 p.c. to 10 p.c. tin
has recently been exposed in the Victory,
Lottah (Tas.). The co. proposes issuing
a further 25 shares of £lOO each to provide
a small mill to work the find.
* * * *
Stanley Reward tin (Tas.) is being
passed over to tributors. During its last
half-year only four tons oxide were pro-
duced, and that meant a loss.

North Mt. Farrell (Tas.) has hit on
some promising ore 200 ft. in a crosscut at
the No. 5 level, with payable, though irre-
gular, metal on the hanging wall. This
level is now making out under where good
ore was reported to be going underfoot.
* * * *
Ilampden-Cloncurry (N.Q.), after losing
10 weeks through failure of coke supplies
owing to the engineers’ strike, resumed
smelting on the 20th inst. Development
work has been carried on vigorously, and
large quantities of ore raised. At the
Crown, about nine miles from the Duchess,
the shaft is being timbered and head-gear
erected. This show is believed to he on
the same line of lode as the Duchess.
RavenswQod Gold Mining Co. (N.Q.) lias
reported a promising development in its
Grant mine. Although much exploration
work has been done during the past few
years, Ravenswood has seen very little metal.
Boring on the Queensland State coal pros-
pecting area at Styx River, near St. Law-
rence, has resulted in a 10ft. seam being
struck at 715 ft. in undisturbed country.
Electrolytic zinc has come to stay.
Canada has increased its daily production
from 20 to 70 tons, and expects to soon put
out 100 tons daily. Risdon (Tas.) is ex-
panding as fast as money and men can
make it.
Maoriland’s old golden wonder, the Waihi,
is being pinched by high costs. The direc-
tors have circularised shareholders, warning
them that recent concessions to labor, with
other troubles, have so lifted costs that much
ore previously regarded as payable will have
to be pa-ssed by.
Mt. Greenland Gold (M.L.) has recently
re-equipped and started operations on the
lode exposed by the old Cedar Creek Co.,
Ross. The ore averages 15dwt. over a stop-
ing width of 4ft., but the strike is not long.
The co. is undertaking a vigorous policy of
development on this and parallel lodes.
Cedar Greek was best known for its stamp-
mill made entirely of wood, even to the
cam-shaft, the inefficiency of which caused
operations to cease nearly 30 years ago.

P. J. Prichard, editor of the Launceston
Examiner, who went west last week while
on a visit to Lakemba (N.S.W.), drove a
facile pen, besides being a golden talker and
a very fine old gentleman. He had been
most things that a man can be in Australia
in his day, and was never so happy as when
lie could sit on his verandah overlooking the
Tamar and talk of early overlanding. Since
going to Tasmania he had identified himself
with every forward movement in the State;
and his experience, his broad outlook and
his passionate belief in the future of the
Speck made him a commanding personality
both in and outside the editorial chair.

Vic. Treasurer McPherson, who is suffer-
ing from heart strain, has not improved
much under rest conditions, and he may have
to relinquish office. A little time will dis-
close what road he will take.
Under the new Federal salary scheme
Hughes gets about £3OOO a year, and
each of liis Ministers something in the
neighborhood of £2OOO. The Speaker, Pre-
sident of the Senate and the two Chairmen
of Committees are close to the latter figure,
whilst the Opposition leaders in Reps, and
Senate are promoted, the one from £6OO to
£l4OO, the other from £6OO to £l2OO.
One of the splendid officers of the fighting
13th, now in Crouy Cemetery, near Abbe-
ville, was nicknamed Nugget. Nugget’s
build was unsoldierly,
and the issue clothes
“fitted him all over.”
Add to this a .casual-
ness regarding dress,
and you have Nugget
as O.C. rearguard
marching back through
Bailleul after Mes-
sines. Catching sight
of the Brig, waiting
to see the march, his
colonel suddenly gal-
loped back to the rear,
looked again at Nug-
get and roared ; “For
God’s sake. Nugget,
let the sergeant take
charge, and get in
amongst the prisoners,
so the General won’t
know you’re an offi-
cer !”
ADMIRAL GRANT,
Australian Navy's
first naval member,
who last week received
the thanks of the Aus-
tralian Parliament on
behalf of the naval
forces.
Monash could have been caught as \ ic.
Chief of Police 13 years ago. when Sams-
bury was selected, if he had been pressed.
Perhaps it is a good thing for Australia that
he was not snared by Bent, as he might have
got into a groove which wouldn’t lmv« helped
him to project those enterprises that turned
the tide ’in' a world’s war.
In the Reps. Labor easily beats the
Nationalists for fatness. Mathews, _ Page
and Ryan form a tier of lard. The biggest,
jolliest jowl belongs to Page, and he pro-
vides the heartiest laugh and the most
gurgling interjections. Mathews, clean-
shaven now like Page, lacks Page’s bene-
volent aspect. Ryan, his noble chops shin-
ing pinkly above the others, only needs to
have his bit of moustache removed to com-
plete a perfect trio of Fat Men.
Death has erased the name of Walter
Gamble from Victoria’s civil pension-roll,
but it will go on shining in the annals of
the Education Department for the service
he rendered the State-school cadet move-
ment. His educational methods were old-
fashioned and his prejudices strong, but in
essentials he was thorough. His own road
was pretty rough till he was well over 80.
He began to earn his bread as a monitor
when he was 10, in the year 1853. By
1877 he was an inspector, and he kept on
reviewing other teachers’ work till he was
65, and that was 12 years ago.
Charles James Jackson, a great organ-
builder, and withal a very modest man,
passed out a few days ago, aged 80. As
far back as the middle ’sixties he was in
partnership with a Air. Young in Pitt-
street —probably the first firm of piano-
builders in Australia. Later he was in busi-
ness for himself in Newtown. He it was
who erected the Sydney Town Hall organ
under instructions from the makers, Hill
and Sons, of London, and the University
organ, towards which the late Patrick Jen-
nings gave £llOO. He built the organs in
the Centenary Hall (now wiped out), St.
John’s and All Saints’ (Parramatta), St.
Stenhen’s (Penrith), St. Mark’s (Darling
Point) and Pitt-street Congregational; also
the instrument for the Exhibition Building
in 1870, constructed entirely of Australian
timbers.
Salmond, Solicitor-General of Maoriland,
takes up to the Bench a fine intellect, lie
has been in turn Uni. Professor -first at
Adelaide, then at Wellington—the author ot
two standard text-books, counsel to the Law
Drafting Office, Solicitor-General and now lie
is Judge. As author his “Jurisprudence, and
“Law of Torts’’ are as near to literature as
law-books can be. Both have won high
honors, the Swiney Prize coming to the
“Jurisprudence” and the Harvard Law 1 rize
to the “Torts.” The legislation prepared
by him is actually written in the English
language, a minor miracle in itself. As
Solicitor-General, he shattered tradition by
appearing personally and with success in
important Crown cases. His written judg-
ments will give flavor to the dry-as-dust
of the Law Reports. And in liis spare
moments he can contemplate his own statue
—in other words, read highly laudatory
obituary notices of himself which appeared
in leading English law papers a year or
two back.
Died last week Norman Menzies, who had
the misfortune to be quartered at Menzies’
Hotel, Melbourne, as its young boss before
he was out of his teens. Circumstances
made him an entertainer of the theatrical
world, and it was the pride of his young
heart for many years to be seen in the com-
pany of smart actresses and actors. Mar-
riage with Dorothy Vane steadied him
awhile, but he was never fair to himself, and
his health was gone for a long time before
lie passed out at 55.
At last an opponent—Stille, of Vic. —
has been dug up for W. S. Viner, chess king
of Australia since 1906, or thereabouts.
Viner was champion of W.A. at 18, and had
only voted at one election when he beat
Watson (Vic.) for the Commonwealth belt,
lie left off moving ivory pawns and pieces
to become a pawn himself in a mightier
game, with half the world for a board, but
after the Foch defence proved too much
for Ludendorff, he returned undamaged to
his N. S. Wales farm.
To hear the late Colonel “Billy” Mailer
tell about his young days, when, as an 18-
year-old bombardier of the R.H.A., he had
charge of a barrack-room full of men who
would often return from leave with their
shirts and socks pawned for beer, was like
listening to Mulvaney. “Billy” had a file
of correspondence inches thick about his loss
of a day’s seniority. One of his missives
was returned with a note that his “tone was
hardly the correct one in which to address
H.Q.” Billy handed it to a younger officer,
his language scorching the wall-paper, and
finishing with: “Here, my boy; see if you
can put some grovel into this.” “Billy”
outwardly professed a great contempt for his
militia gunners, but really he was almost
bursting with pride in them, and the great
success of the Vic. batteries in the A.I.F.
must be largely credited to him, who for
many years was their chief instructor. His re-
marks* in the A.F.A. riding-school are classics
in military Melbourne. A recruit-officer was
going through the school, and was being
bounced about in a smooth, gripless military
saddle on a rough, hard-mouthed gun-horse.
At last Billy roared, “Sit still, sir! Sit
still. By , sir, if you swallowed a ram-
rod you’d pass a corkscrew.”
Among the several S. Aus. politicians who
will not seek re-election are Angas Parsons,
K.C., and Blackburn, V.C. Both are law-
yers, and both, disillusionised about Parlia-
ment, propose to stick to costs.
John Talbot, dead in Adelaide at 85 (and
given the military funeral which that city
tenders to all of its Corps of Veterans),
claimed to have the oldest Distinguished Con-
duct Medal in Australasia. He won it in
September, 1863, with the York and Lan-
caster regiment, at a Maori pah.
Johnny Sandes, who is “doing” the Prince-
let for the Australian Press Association,
married a daughter of Graham Berry, the
Vic. tribune of the ’seventies and early
’eighties. May 11 was a Berry anniversary.
On that date in ’77 Liberalism (the real
thing) swept Vic. under his guidance.
The coiffeur goes to the Gallery :—■
Considine, of the Barrier, and Blakeley, of the
Darling, give me the impression of putting in the
best hairbrush drill. The Broken Hill man has
a blue-black pompadour of imposing size, pushed
well off his lofty forehead, and a magnificent sweep
of hair goes back from behind each ear. Blakeley,
with a fair thatch, has it well under control, very
neatly parted, and waved in a curly billow standing
erect over his right eyebrow.
Though the old tradition that one should
have been a college professor before becom-
ing an R.C. bishop has had a good many
holes knocked in it lately, it was restored
in the case of Father Whyte, P.P. of En-
more (N.S.W.), the new Bishop of Dun-
edin. A Kilkenny man, Whyte, on reaching
Australia, was appointed to the Cardinal’s
College at Manly under the presidency of
Monsignor whom he succeeds in the
Dunedin see. There, with the late Rev.
Reginald Bridge, son of the Sydney wool
house, he helped teach the 15 students who
comprised the College 80 years ago. Thence
he succeeded the late Father Timoney (who
died on the operating-table in England after
padre-ing through the Boer War) as inspec-
tor of schools. Latterly, the Archbishop
appointed him Chancellor of the Archdiocese
—that’s the job of looking after historical
documents relating to Catholicism in Aus-
tralia. Keen, scholarly and suave, the new
bishop has the saving grace of humor.

GAUD
MAYOR
AIRMAN , of
Melbourne,
waiting for
the Prince.
Mr. and Mrs. T. P. Parker, of Gawler.
are believed to be the first two S. Australians
to celebrate their “diamond wedding.” Mar-
ried at Gawler in 1800. they went on their
honeymoon-trip in a dray drawn by four
bullocks. John Wauchope, best man at the
wedding, is still on deck at 95.
Mrs. Mary Roberts, Who for a quarter
of a century has run a private zoo at Beau-
maris (Tas.). had her 80th birthday the
other day. She was the first to get the
now-rare Tasmanian devil to breed in cap-
tivity, and she knows as much about the
ways and wants of that weird beastie as
anyone living. She has also done well with
the Tasmanian “tigers,” though not to the
extent of inducing them to increase and
multiply. As to the opossum, mice and
such small fry, they eat out of her hand.
Dr. Breinl is leaving the Institute of
Tropical Medicine at Townsville to go into
private practice. lie has been there for 10
years, and if he hadn’t been an Austrian the
Institute would have been, a greater suc-
cess. Under a new director the chances are
that it will branch out and become more
practical; so far its work has been too
exclusively in the laboratory. Brienl.
though an Austrian, worked at Liverpool
(Eng.) for many years before he was
chosen for the job at Townsville.
General Booth worked six years for that
Nottingham pawnbroker (B. 13/5/’2O), but
his mother was Mary Moss, and that was
probably more important. She it was who
brought the tribal nose and bent into the
family. After his Nottingham apprentice-
ship Booth went to London and got a job
with a Walworth pawnbroker, and it was
there he felt a call to preach. He “thought
of going out to Australia on a convict ship
to face the storm and the billow, and the
tempest’s rolling wave, and to preach to. the
very worst of men,” but he became a revival-
ist preacher at a pound a week instead.
BEING AN ADDRESS OF WELCOME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I greet you, youthful Prince, with right good-will,
But lo! my loyal heart is black as night
And cold as is the world when on the hill
The sun’s last kisses linger ere his flight:
I feel that you, the while with us you stay,
Are paying for our Roman holiday.
Others may sing of gonfalons, and guards
Who stand, lithe-linibed, beside the Southern Gate ;
1 leave your youthful mirth to other bards,
1 drily sing my pity for your state —
1 only wail to see a decent bloke
W ho may not treat a lord mayor as a joke.
1 read the portent of your visit and
The compliment it is and all of that,
And yet if you should see me glumly stand
Weeping round tears into my brand-new hat,
VoivTl recognise I mourn for young Romance
Who died because the thousands watch you dance.
Your job is so persistent it must sit
Upon your youthful chest by night and day ;
if in your blue pyjamas you should flit
Down to the bathroom when the dawn is grey,
V “special representative” will glean
That you use soap to keep your features clean.
In train and car, in ballroom, when you eat,
'Hie hungry eyes will feast upon your face,
And endless streams of men with large flat feet
Will pile addresses on you in each place;
The snobs and toadies will enmesh your time
In endless writhings and expensive slime.
Young Prince, I’m not the sort of chap you’ll know,
1 don’t wag flags, nor am I in “the set,”
But by these presents I am fain to show
We realise you’re earning all you get—
I speak for all the mob who do not fuss;
We reckon you put up with much from us!
VICTORIA.
DALE COLLINS.
THE PRINCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In this boy’s photoed smile there lurks, methinks,
The vision of a former Edward who
Through London town long, long ago did ride,
The fairest of young creatures by his side —
King Christian’s daughter, and his promised bride.
Heavens, how we cheered!
No brighter pair e’er lived in old wives’ tales
Of royal weddings. When I think of how
I helped the mob to shout, and wore . white rosette
For this boy’s grandad and his sweet best-girl
Well, then, my stars I thank that I’m alive
To pinch myself and ask “Can this be true?”
The truckling spirit of their flunkey dispositions;
The born desire to grovel and be grovelled to;
The mean ambition to be “honored” by the King
For ill-got riches, or for deeds of empty show,
Make fatmen bawl the Anthem.
My childhood keeps me loyal to the Crown.
No brewing barons, whisky-stilling earls,
No loud Jew-blooded lords have my regard.
I hold none lordly save my lord the King,
And them who, blessed (or cursed) by royal birth,
Play their old game for all the gams is worth.
So, be he eight feet high, or somewhat small,
“God save the Prince!” I cry. Why not? God save
us all!
VICTORIA.
EDMUND FISHER.

MRS. GREEN : “Do you ever flatter your
husband ?”
MRS. WYSE: “Oh yes, I sometimes aslc his
advice about things .”
Returned Diggers tell a little yarn of the
Princelet’s bashfulness. .Not long back he
encountered at an official handshake at
Buckingham Palace a number of Aussies
whom he had previously met in Belgium.
Shyly hanging back, he apparently meant
to dodge the ceremony, but his mamma
gently nudged him into the foreground and
told him to have a word with the boys.
Edward would have had many words in less
tremendous surroundings, but under the
eyes of his family he could only creep for-
ward nervously and say: “How d’ye do? I
suppose you don’t remember me?”
“2941”: This was one of the incidents
that led to Shepheard’s Hotel at Cairo
being put out of bounds to “other ranks.”
Big Bill, Q.M.S., who was killed later, was
having dinner at Shepheard’s one day and
spotted old Sir John Maxwell, then G.0.C.,
and considered one of the greatest authorities
on Egypt. Bill remembered Maxwell at
school in England, and for various reasons
didn’t like the old gentleman. (The old
gentleman had refused to remember him.)
Stepping smartly over to his table, Bill
saluted and stood erect until the General
deigned to glance up from his soup. “Sir
John Maxwell, I believe,” said Bill. “Yes,”
barked the old man. “I understand, Sir
John, that you are one of the leading authori-
ties on Egypt.” “Well?” said Maxwell.
“And,” continued Bill, “I believe I am cor-
rect in saying that there is no part of Egypt,
however remote, with which you are un-
acquainted.” “Yes —well?” snorted the
General. Summoning his sweetest smile.
Bill leant over and whispered: “Then per-
haps y' u can direct me to the gentlemen’s
lavatory, Sir John.”
* * * *
“Whitehall”: The Financial Secretary to
the War Office defended last week in the
House of Commons “the return of the Army
to uniforms costing £3,000,000 over the first
five years.” He said the outlay was “neces-
sary in order to keep up esprit de corps.”
The figures, vast though they are, give no
idea of the cost of the pre-war uniforms to
some of those affected. At present prices
the original outfit of a Life Guards officer
would not cost less than £3500. The three
old tunics of a mere Foot Guardsman would
probably work out nowadays at about 40
guineas each. And then in all the regi-
ments there are mess kits, full parade
dresses and so forth, each with its
appropriate cap, boots, etc., which vary in
price, but are never other than fantastically
expensive. The bill for the jacket of an
R.11.A. subaltern, for example, would in it-
self be enough to make a shipping profiteer
sit up these days. There was actually a
coat for use at court-martials only in the old
army; and as even the obscurest subaltern
in the most unfashionable line regiment was
always liable to be detailed as junior mem-
ber of a D.C.M., no one could escape buy-
ing the garment. A reversion to the gaudy
uniforms of the past will also necessitate
liveries for batmen and men-waiters, repre-
senting a further heavy charge on the offi-
cers. The evident aim now, as it was in
the past, is to exclude the type of officer who
has to support himself on his military pay.
It should benefit Australia, inasmuch as fully
90 per cent, of the brilliant young A.I.F.
officers who transferred to Imperial units
after the Armistice will find themselves
unable to go the financial pace and are likely
to gravitate homewards accordingly.
“Splinter”: The fragrance of beer pre-
ceded him and he wobbled in his course like
a wounded tank. When he noticed me he
hesitated and blinked. lie appeared to be
engrossed with some serious mental problem
and his watery eyes concentrated on the 30
teet of space between me and the street
wall. ‘ Sorright,” he murmured at last, “I
think I can miss you.” lie did.

In a southern district which the Prince is
to visit, his father, when in the locality on
the occasion of his first
Australian call 40 years
ago, planted an elm-tree.
The tree grew to a fine
vegetable, but in a
moment of local absence
of mind it was cut down.
hen it became known
that the Prince would
pass through the town-
ship consternation seized
the elders. They hastily
got their heads together,
with the result that a
fairly large elm from an-
other locality was dug
up holus bolus, and with
a ton of soil bagged
about its roots was
dumped on the site of
the royal tree. Now they’re watching the
behavior of the transplanted fraud with
pitiable concern.
“P. Pawnticket”: Mr. Smith is a pillar of
the Sunday-school my kids affect, and a lead-
ing local tradesman. He has a habit of
picking out bright Scholars and asking them
to repeat a prayer. This gave me an idea
which caused Mrs. Pawnticket to marvel at
my sudden devotion to the religious instruc-
tion of the children. So when Smith’s fancy
alighted on one of my youngsters last Sab-
bath the little fellow clasped his hands,
closed his eyes, and, exalting his face,
lisped:—
Bless and keep us, every one;
Bless mamma and daddy dear;
If it really can be done,
Pardon Smith the profiteer.
Mrs. Pawnticket says it was a cruel thing
to do to the child, and I believe the church
regards me as an outlaw. But I am satisfied
that the Sunday-school has its usefulness.
“Mirza”: Oversea graduates of medicine
might be in for a rough spin if we adopted
“Aloin’s” suggestion (8.13/5/’2O) that they
should be required to pass the same exam-
inations as the fifth year (final) student;
for success at that holocaust is achieved, not
TOO MUCH LIKE EUOLID.
“Why did you break it off icith George?”
“Oh, he’s all side since he’s back from the Front.”
so much through knowledge dragged from
text-books and watdwork, as through an inti-
mate acquaintance with the eccentricities
and pet theories of the examining medicoes.
The wise student is a Boswell who pads
after those honoraries who, later, will exam-
ine him; he jots down their explanations of
certain phenomena, adopts their nomencla-
ture, and learns off a score or so of their
favorite prescriptions. At the clinical
exam, he fires their own stuff back at them,
and romps home from those who stick close
to recognised authorities. That the sugges-
tion of “Aloin,” if carried out, might create
curious situations, is proved by a recent in-
cident. Two graduates, desiring honors for
hospital appointments, were allowed to sit
for the ordinary final examinations, and
were well and truly shot, while students
from the hospital where they were “resi-
dents” got through.

“F. 0.” : When the municipal councillors
of Richmond and Collingwood got into touch
with the fruit-growers and market-gardeners
and started their open-air markets, the
democratic consumers of those suburbs lined
up with bags, trucks and prams, and humped
their apples and cabbages home happily.
Presently Haw-haw-thorn council thought
it would carry on the good work and set
apart convenient places, where growers duly
lined up. After a few weeks’ experience
the growers have given Hawthorn the glassy
eye. Mrs. and Miss Hawthorn duly mean-
dered along—about an hour later than the
other suburbs—and inspected the goods
offered. They wanted fruit and vegetables,
but they also wanted the goods delivered
at their back door, and the grower has other
work to do. A few were willing to hump
their purchases a street or two away, but
discovered with grief that half a dozen cab-
bages can’t be conveniently packed in a
violin case. So the market froze. Still
Haw-haw-thorn ought to be happy: it has
preserved appearances.
How the bestowal of Parliament’s thanks
on Billjack and Billjim and their war-work-
ing cobbers struck an old Melbourne gallery
hand :
No ceremony that has had the historic Queen’s
Hail for a setting is destined to be more memorable
than that held on May 20 to present the thanks of
Australia to the representatives of the victorious
sea, air and land forces. As the two Houses had
adopted a joint resolution, it was thought better to
have a single ceremony than to summon the recipients
to the bar of each Chamber; and the hall chosen,
associated as it is with many epoch-making events
in Commonwealth and State politics, was not
unworthy of the occasion. The lights shone with
fascinating brightness on the uniforms and decora-
tions of the warriors, and picked out the red capes
of the nurses as if searching for the hearts of gold
the scarlet covered. Founders of the Constitution
and giants in the struggle for democratic freedom
looked down from their frames on the wall on the
scene, and who shall question that their shades did
not hover near? The dignified way in which the
Senate and Representatives, headed by the President
and Speaker, entered and took their places on either
side of the dais erected in front of the Queen Vic-
toria statue, the earnestness which the President
of the Senate put into the presentation of the reso-
lution, and the acknowledgments of Admiral Grant,
Gen. Chauvel and Gen. Monash, who were given
places on the dais, all added to the impressiveness
of the ceremony. Monash struck the keynote of
what all the recipients felt—that there was no honor
so highly prized in a democratic community as
the bestowal of the nation’s thanks, through Par-
liament, for services rendered to the nation. For
a quarter of an hour Parliament was seen at its
best. It reflected the real Australia.
THE LOYAL WIFE.
“I told your husband a lovely joke the other
night—did he tell it to you ?”
“No, he did not —he wouldn't repeat anything
so disgusting!"
(Continued on page 18.)
In a photographer’s showcase on The
Block, Melbourne, appears the picture of
Gaud Mayor Aikman, and across the glass
of the case runs the legend “Girl wanted.”
In view of the near approach of the Prince
there might be advantages about having a
real instead of a mere Acting-Mayoress.
Still, these things are usually handled in a
more tactful manner.
AUTUMNAL MAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Once more with us sweet autumn dwells,
Though summer still,
Loath to be gone,
With flannel-flowers and Christmas bells,
By swamp) and hill
Still lirigers on.
This month, of May-~how charmed it is,
This month that weaves
Dreams dear as love,
M herein the gentle breezes kiss
The shining leaves
That dance above!
’Tis autumn, but there is no dearth
Of frond and vine;
(Had greenery
Still clothes the kind, complacent earth,
And splendors shine
On bush and tree.
The moonlights drowse on bill and stream,
As in and out
The lizards creep
From shade to shine; and all things seem
As though about
To fall asleep.
The spider-flower, flame-red, or red
As youth’s red lips,
Burns in green glooms;
And here and there, with shapely head
And glossy tips,
The sapling blooms.
How violet is yon distant smoke
That, rising, dims
Green grove and glade!
How rich the she-oak’s russet cloak,
How still its limbs,
How deep its shade!
In secret glooms the thrushes sit,
Their throats athrill
With melody,
While long-billed honey-suckers flit,
No moment still,
From tree to tree.
By wood and wave she wanders now,
Autumnal May !
No falling leaf,
Nor stricken blade, nor leafless bough
Makes wan her way
With woodland grief.
N.S.W.

“Crock Digger”: A concert party sent
down from London by Oscar Asche was
giving an entertainment at Dartford Hos-
pitaJ in ’IS. A girl was singing to an orches-
tral accompaniment, when a heavy-footed
Digger entered the hall by the far-end door.
He tramped in. regardless of everybody and
everything. The girl stopped singing, the
orchestra ceased playing, and a storm was
about to break, when a reproachful voice
broke the silence with: “You might have
hung your horse up outside, mate!”
“Quack’s Officer”: “Alcoholism the result
of war service” is a term which has been
evolved b.v the medical-officers who have
dealings with ex-members of the A.I.F. It
is an official recognition of the weakening of
the power of moral resistance in many ex-
soldiers, and is well justified. N. S. Wales
legal authorities have recognised this fact,
and have promised a differential treatment
for soldiers, taking into consideration the
effects of their war service. That is fair,
bui the inclination to commit minor offences
against the law and the standards of good
behavior is a thing altogether apart from
the inclination to commit definite criminal
offences. Moral weakness resulting from
war experience does not prompt a man to
arm himself with a revolver for the purpose
of behaving like a highwayman. To such
men, whose service is only presumptive in
most cases, the fact that they have worn
khaki merely comes as a glorious excuse for
their misdeeds when they are brought to book.
There is a nasty look in Miss Maoriland’s eye
when she reads that another thousand Brit-
ish damsels, many flashing engagement-
lings lavished on them by the homing Dig-
ger, are about to be dumped on an over-
SETTLING HER.

“How?”
“I’ll kiss her and let you see us.”
stocked market. A few more such announce-
ments and the moist remains of some im-
porting Minister, neatly dispatched with a
hatpin, will be picked up in a Wellington
street. There is no room for foreign com-
petition in the husbhnd-hunting industry;
the struggle for a crust-winner is keen
enough as it is. At the 1916 census 95,316
Maorilanders in the 20-30 age-group wore
skirts, and only 70,431 were in tweed pants.
Certainly most of the missing 24,885 were
at the other end of the earth, having an
argument with Jerry and his offsider Achmet;
still, “even in peace-times,” the Government
Statistician cheerfully remarks, “most of the
larger centres have more female inhabitants
than male.” And he cites Nelson as “a
classic example.” Oddly enough, Nelson,
despite its preponderance of petticoats, in-
THE PERFECT WORKMAN.
“ Cecil! Whatever are yon doing?"
“’S 'all right, m’dear. Don’t bother. I've
done it."
variably votes continuance, which rather
damages the popular impression that lovely
woman—apart from Mrs. Bung and Sissie
the barmaid and the brewery-carter's wife
—is prohibition’s main prop. The wowsers
have a theory that the godly young men of
Nelson migrate from its beer-soaked atmo-
sphere and marry no-license girls. Anyhow,
the supply of unattached male, godly and
ungodly, is running so short that if there
are to be any more invading battalions of
pink-cheeked pommies they will have to pass
over the short skirts and silk-ankled stock-
ings of infuriated home-grown spinsters
dug-in on the wharf.
* * * *
“Spare Corp” : No more treatment is to be
given to ex-Diggers with recurrent V.D.
gathered on active ser-
vice. Hitherto these men
were entitled to treat-
ment ; but the official
view now is that they
were cured before quit-
ting khaki and that they
must have been re-
infected. As a matter of
fact, many sufferers dis-
charged in Australia were
far from cured. M.O.’s
on transports, reluctant
to spoil the homecoming,
frequently gave a clean
bill to men on their pro-
mise to continue treat-
ment ashore, and many
promises went astray
when their makers met
the beer of hospitality.
Apart from that, a recur-
rence of V.I). is always
likely in a man once in-
fected, if he doesn’t look
after himself. The new
order of things is heartless to the individual
in many instances, and is nationally short-
sighted anyhow.

“G.”: The jazz girl who gets her hair
“waved” in a city beauty parlor is full-
sister to the New Guinea buck who prances
on the coast from Cape Vogel north. The
buck’s hair is dressed to last for two or three
weeks, so, in order that it may not be dis-
arranged during sleep, he uses a little wooden
pillar a few inches high to rest his ear on.
The whole male population is particular
about its hairdressing during the dancing sea-
son which follows the harvest. (On moon-
light nights the revelry lasts till sunrise.)
The bucks are fastidious the whole year
round. Formerly it was common to see lines
of 10 to 12 sitting one behind the other, each
doing the hair of the knut in front.
-*‘Y. Pawnticket”: I’ll swear that the
absurd and extravagant inquiries into the
cost of living have done infinitely more harm
than good to the households of Sydney, at
any rate. Xu a domestic brawl, dragged to
a police codrt for investigation, it was men-
tioned that “the defendant was usually a
good-tempered man,
but a row had
occurred as a result of
an argument arising
from a discussion of
the evidence before the
Basic Wage Commis-
sion.” Mrs. Bloggs,
who, like most wives,
wants more money
than she can get, em-
ploys the testimony of
Truthful James and
Veracious Vera to
show that she is
shamefully sweated
in the share she gets
of the family income,
and points to the
saintly husbands who
do not drink, smoke
or go to the races, and
keep only 2s. Gd. per
week for their own
pockets; while Bloggs
points to the women
who do not spend
money on dresses, but
manage to make their
rags do somehow ; and
to show his own sac-
rifice draws attention
to things he does not
have which other men
swear are necessaries.
Such arguments are
always liable to be-
come bitter, because
Bloggs knows that the
half-crown pocket-
money husband in
whom Mrs. Bloggs
pretends to believe is
a myth, whilst the
lady knows that the
no-clothing-for-three-years woman to whom
Bloggs pins a simple faith is a lie.

“D.J.”: When the Brisbane Diggers
paraded before Birdwood. Lieut.-Governor
Bill Lennon, sporting a silk hat, awaited the
salute at the G.P.O. Oblivious of his grand-
eur, Birdie rode past and saluted the dis-
abled Diggers and sisters seated nearby. A
staff-officer putting him wise, the General
rode back and saluted his Excellency, who
waved the belltopper in courteous acknow-
ledgment. Then he looked towards the Royal
Hotel, whereupon Birdie, leaning over, said
to Bill: “Can you keep one down?” or
words to that effect. Thus was another war
averted.

“Bad Australian”: As everybody knows,
the folk down at Dundee (M.L.) are verra
Scotch. Some time ago the local council
called tenders for a road-making job, and
when the numbers went up the contract was
awarded to one Duncan Mcßeans. Duncan’s
price was so much lower than that of any of
the other Macs who tendered for the work
that the canny councillors hesitated before
notifying him that he was a winner. Duncan
attended at the shire office next day to sign
up, but when the secretary clapped eyes on
him he nearly died of heart failure. “Duncan
Mcßeans!” he gasped. “Whut on Goad’s
airth do ye mean, mon? Why, yeer juist
naething mair nor'less than a Chinnyman!”
“Hi-yah !” chattered Duncan. “Whaffor you
askim me that way? Me Chineeman all li!
Make velly goo’ load—welly stlong blidge.
Allee sern, s’posem me not Scotchman me
no calchee contlact.”
■* * * *
“Bardi” goes to a jazz:—
Scene: The ballroom of a fashionable Australian
hotel. Time: an afternoon in mid-autumn. Jazz-band
by the south wall, swing doors on the north, east
and west the tea-tables moderately populous with
knuts and flappers there to dance, and rubber-necks
there to see them do it. Groups of waiters near the
portals, gauging by the cut of each new arrival’s
clothes the probable size of his tip. A clatter of
tea-things, the tap-tap of high heels on the polished
floor and the murmur of small talk. Spirals of
cigarette-smoke ascend from the tables. A lady in
blue tailor-mades produces a packet of gold-tips,
lights one awkwardly and bites it. Then the band
bursts stertorously into syncopated discord and the
rout begins. The gents, who jazz are mostly young
returned soldiers, out for a lark, with rinsings of
male flappers, sheepmen’s younger sons and worried-
looking Lotharios, obviously wondering if the wife
will ever hear of it. The ladies are mostly of the
resting shopgirl class, with here and there a
sportive young married woman on the fringe of
“society.” They dance with all the grace and aban-
don of a herd of cattle struggling through a bog.
The jazz is not so much a dance as a series of
shuffles, and no doubt the nigger in his native
haunts shuffles with a simian-like ease and sense of
rhythm. But this crowd of educated Europeans
can’t shuffle for nuts. The men wrestle the girls
round the room in a style half-Graeco-Roman, half-
Collingwood. Some of them work their partners’
hands like pump-handles; others grab their lumps
of loveliness as they would sacks of flour. The lady
in the blue tailor-mades bites another cigarette.
When one atrocity ceases the dancers applaud lan-
guidly, and the band, thus encouraged, rips out
another roaring cataract of nigger cacophony more
hideous than the last. Dull is the music, dreary
the dancing, dismal the aspect of the dancers; in
fact, the whole damn thing is too ugly to be seduc-
tive, too depressing to be a danger to youth. The
jazz is dying. In dreadful decrepitude it awaits
the old woman who washes the corpse. Stand by
for the wave of wowserism which always succeeds
to a period of license. It will soon be the fashion —
as it was among the gay French ladies of Louis the
Fourteenth’s court —to carry prayer-books.
“T. 0.1.” : As the Prince’s grand-uncle, the
Duke of Edinburgh, drew near, a heated argu-
ment arose in Victoria over the official wel-
coming. J. S. Butters, Mayor of Melbourne,
backed by the aldermen and councillors,
was determined to give him a fitting recep-
tion. The Sandridge Town Council, how-
ever, put in a claim to be first, as he was to
land at the local Railway Pier. And so it
was arranged. But both Sandridge and
Melbourne counted without Thomas Howard
Fellows —afterwards Justice Fellows —who
was looked upon as King of Queenscliff,
where he had a summer residence. After
entering the Heads the Galatea rounded to
the South Channel and was boarded by a
Customs boat. In this craft were Charles
Kennedy (Mayor) and Robert Jordan (town
clerk) of Queenscliff, with an address pre-
pared by Fellows, who had a splendid time
chuckling at the discomfiture of the others.

“Ex-Dig”: Although the gratuity-forms
show the usual cheerful disregard for the
paper shortage, they aren’t capacious enough
to record Joe Swingitt’s services to his
country. Joe sports his “A” and a red
chevron whenever he thinks he can do so
with safety, but he doesn’t brag about it.
His disappearance from Liverpool camp
synchronised with the moving out of his
draft. He enlisted in Brisbane under
another name, but when the M.O. grew un-
kind Joseph beat it again and swung back
into camp in South Aus. In the course of
a stirring military career he saw service
in all the training-camps in Australia until,
recruits becoming scarce, the hearts of the
military authorities hardened, and Private
Swingitt was taken prisoner in Melbourne
and “shanghaied.” He deserted at Durban,
and again at Capetown, spending a few
months in camp at each place, and during the
rest of the war he sampled the produce of
every brewery in England. His record, in
brief, is : Enlistments, eight; days spent in the
trenches, nil. Still, this hero of many bars
is looking forward quite joyfully to his
gratuity. In order to get it early he has
married a girl who isn’t too particular as
long as there is a fiver in it for her, and the
probability is that Private Swingitt will be
paid a lot more than many dinkum Diggers
who were married when they enlisted and
who can only speed up the issue of their
papers by claiming that children, these days,
are necessitous circumstances.
QUITE SAFE NOW.
“But I’m such a devil of a fellow —do you
think it would he safe for a nice girl
like you to go in surfing with me?”
“Of course! The life-savers are hack from
the war now!”
DRINKING WITH CARE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ‘S'he was drinking in 1913, but,’ he added, ‘she
then drank with care.’ ” —Petitioner in Sydney
Divorce C&urt.
Drink —but always be a lady.
When the room goes round,
Seek a corner-seat that’s shady,
Sit in thought profound.
Don’t engage in conversation,
See your hat is straight;
Check that feeling of elation,
Keep quite still and wait.
When the jazz band stops its thumping,
When your head is clear,
And the floor’s no longer jumping,
Tell your hostess, “Dear,
Here just now I nearly fainted)!
Too much jazz, I think.”
Sigh like one quite unacquainted
With the fumes of drink.
Drink with dainty hesitation,
Like a young gazelle;
View long drinks with consternation.
When the tinkling bell
Brings the waiter to your table
Cut out Cocktail Three.
Say as clearly as you’re able,
“Nothing, thanks, for me.”

“Bouragi”: “Jack Beer” errs in conclud-
ing that I have “mixed with very low-class canni-
bals.” Many of niv anthropophagist acquaintances
have been the very cream of the profession. To men-
tion only two leaders in the palmy days of Papuan
cannibalism, when the white invasion was adding
to the variety of an always-sporting “long-pig”
country, there were Busimai-mai, of the Mamba, and
Ambushi, of the Kumusi. The first was the organ-
iser of the brilliant hop-over at Tamata which
resulted in the capture and cooking of Resident-
Magistrate Green and his police. He is credited,
too, with organising the massacre of Clark, the
discoverer of Charters Towers, and his party on
Ihe Mamba, a year earlier than the Green episode.
Of great strength of character, Busimai was never-
theless insincere, and no one could call him a pevson
of high breeding. Ambushi, on the other hand, was
a charming and courteous hidalgo. Unhappily, like
others of the old regime, he disdained to adapt
himself to the changing times. I had the honor
of directing his funeral, the latter being rendered
necessary by his execution, at which I also appeared
as sheriff of the Northern Division. The memory
of his 17 disconsolate widows, plastered with mud
and bewailing their lot, haunts me still.
“Shamrock O’Shea”: “Timo” (B.
15/4/’2O) is talking through his hat when he says
molasses as stock feed has no virtues other than
cheapness and as an appetiser. It is not cheap. 1
am paying £2O per ton for it. And it is not an
appetiser. I give my scrub-fed ewes an ounce each
a day, and since doing so I have to do less work
to feed them. All the same, they are rapidly gaining
in condition. When “Timo" added a little to the
feed of dairy cows he found the quantity of milk
reduced one-third and the butter-fat fell to about
•'! p.e. My practical experience extends to one cow.
When she was given a liberal ration of molasses,
supplemented by nothing but box leaves, her yield of
milk and butter, increased 100 p.c. I moisten my
horses' chaff-ration with it, and they are sleek and
fat. Still, anyone with an ounce of commonscnse
would, like “Timo,”go bull-headed for a grain-fed
horse for endurance in preference to a treacle-fed
moke.

“ John Quill”: Next to editors, fish are
the queerest things that infest this planet. Their
methods and motives have always been a puzzle to
me. Hast December we put in a week on the Cudge-
gong (N.S.W.), which, in consequence of the
drought, was represented by a dry river-bed and a
waterhole every half-mile. One pool, 12yds. x
syds. and varying in depth from 2ft. to Bft., we
fished for three or four days and
nights, but caught nothing but
turtles. A pump was then in-
stalled to re-fill the tanks at the
house, and the hole was emptied
in a day or two, revealing five
Murray cod, each about Clb.
weight. Half buried in the mud
we found the skeleton of a mon-
ster fish that must have weight-)
fully 401 b. There was also a
tribe of turtle’s, who immediately
took up their swags and left for
the nearest moisture. We observed
closely, but saw not a shrimp or
crayfish, nor were any of these
crustaceans pumped into the
tanks. A post-mortem disclosed
that four of the cod had nothing
but a small quantity of unrecog-
nisable slop in their stomachs.
The other cod contained two
beetles. No herbage or vegeta-
tion grew in the water, although
there were some bulrushes at the
house, 200yds. away. Now what
expert can explain these things?
(1) What did the fish live on?
(2) Why did they not bite? (3)
Did they devour deceased? (4) Why had deceased
not devoured them, considering his size? (6) Does
a fish know when he’s hungry?

“Bullocky” : In answer to “Mnlga, l ”
“Pongo” and co. rc fencing. In ’BB six men cut,
put up and bored 16 miles of sheep-proof fence
in 17 working days. Posts, mulga and gidya, 4in.
at small end ; box and beefwood, five inches at small
end; 4ft. 4in. long, 440 to the mile, 15in. in the
ground; straining posts every 100yds., 2ft Gin.
in the ground; bored for five wires. Highest
tally for sinking holes and putting in posts, 303;
Price, 18s. 6d. per 100. Highest tally for cutting
posts, 326 ; price, 12s. 6d. Two men cut the posts,
two put them up and two bored them. There was
no wire on the ground to complete the job. This
work was done from the Red Dam to within a mile
of Jaek-on-the-Rocks Hotel, in the Adavale district
(Q.), on Milo sheep-station. The camp consisted of
the following men: Russeli, carting posts; Scottv,
cook; Fowler and Gildea, putting up; Barclay
and Gildea, boring; Walker and Cullen, cutting.
The writer was in that district in the best days,
and never heard of Chris Larsen or of his big tally
or his big price for tiiat class of work.
“L. and Tommy'’; Is there any limit to
tbe life of strychnine ? My experience is that the
hones from a meat bait are deadly years afterwards.
In the far north of S. Aus. we strychnined a piece
of meat for the benefit of the dingoes. Two years
afterwards we were ‘in the vicinity with a couple of
valuable sheep-dogs. They gnawed a bone which was
dry and quite harmless-looking, but proved to be
the remains of the two-year-old bait. Both of them
turned up their toes a few minutes afterwards.

“F.W.”: The third morning after shear-
ing commenced, a weary, hollow-eyed crew of shed-
hands held an indignation meeting at which the bit-
ing topic was bugs. We learned that “Government
House” was singularly free of the pests, but had
cockroaches in the kitchen,
etc. One of our number,
a German, this being be-
fore the war, made a few
investigations and reckoned
he could find a remedy
for our insomnia. Obtain-
ing permission he caught
every cockroach within
sight, and there were

troduced them into our
sleeping quarters. If a ton

been used the result could
not have been more satis-
factory. Fritz told us
later that several years
ago there was a plague of
bugs in Hamburg, and the
authorities sprayed the
afflicted premises with a
mixture whose chief com-
ponent was squashed cock-
roaches, and also placed
live insects in odd corners.
The enemies of decency
and sleep soon gave up the
ghost. All I know is that
where there are cock-
roaches in plenty bugs are
absent, and that in our case the cure lasted as long
as we were there.
“O. K. Eden": “Forester” (B. 15/4/’2O)
says:—
The name of Cuninghame, which the township
of Lakes Entrance (Vic.) suffered under until a
year or two. ago, was a monument to the snobbery
of some local Bumbles. Lakes Entrance was the
old and proper name of the place, but years ago,
when a Cuninghame—somehow related to the Duke
of Argyle—honored Gippsland by settling near
Sale, the place was named after him.
I deprecate “Forester’s” method of writing history.
He also says Cuninghame “went, and left but a
memory, and now the name has faded off the map.”
Robert Cunningham’s name was on the map of
Gippsland many years before “Sale” appeared there.
He settled at Clyde Bank, near Lakes Entrance,
three or four miles from where Sale (?) is now,
in the very early' ’forties. His partner, Robert
Thompson, represented Gippsland in the Victorian
Assembly in the ’fifties, and became a Minister of
the Crown. Boyd Cunningham was also an early
Gippslander. I knew all . the Cunninghams and
Thompson well, and was often at Clyde Bank.
Robert was a much liked and respected man. All
this was when “Flooding Creek” had its beginnings,
years before the place was called “Sale.” “Cunning-
ham’s Crossing” was a household word in the old
days.

“Hamer” : I have sniffed the perfumes of
Royal Commissions, of Governmeift contracts, of
Blaekwattle Bay at its worst, of dead whales and of
No Man’s Land when burials were out of fashion,
but the evilest and the most enduring I have struck
was the incense left where the contents of a wrecked
cream-waggon had soaked into the roadway near
Ilawera (M.L.). Local inhabitants had made a new
track, taking a wide detour to avoid it; yet though
the smell was then nearly three months old, the
lingering memory of it made me feel sick for hours
afterwards. The height of the crops in the neigh-
borhood was explained by the frenzied anxiety of
the wheat to get its head into fresher air.
NOT UNDERSTOOD.
THE ARTIST: “Will yon sit for me?”
THE ER-ER-LADY: “Wodger think I am—a

“Black Bonnet”: One-toed Peter came to
the kitchen-door with his usual rouge-et-noir smile.
“You gettem me billycan, me gettem plenty honey.
Englese bee's,” he said. The bees’ nest was in a
very high tree by the creek. Peter's attendants, two
little boys of his own and an aged “uncle,” tied
the billies to a length of lawyer-cane which Peter
let down, and he drew them up. Then he chopped
a hole behind the nest, set fire to a bunch of dry
leaves and inserted it, holding it there a minute
or two. Then dropping the smoking bundle he boldly
put his hands into the aperture, and soon had the
A GUILTY CONSCIENCE.
THE SINNER: “Stop yer (hie) slinyin' off

and make a full confession, brother.'

the town ter hear.”
billies full of honey-dropping comb, lowering them
to the blacks below by tire lawyer-cane. Then Peter
slipped down like a shadow and stood amongst us.
“Englese bee stingem,” he said, showing his arms
and face, which here and there were marked. The
native bee has no sting, but the nests are hardly
worth taking. On the contrary, the English and
Italian colonios, which are quite common in these
scrubs (Rossville, N.Q.), make big hives and great
quantities of most delicious honey. Peter is a wise
boy. He takes only so much from a nest and returns
again and again to the hive, when more honey has
been manufactured. Peter it was who, returning
sadly through the scrub with me from the funeral
of the owner of Toolkoor, that Eden described in
The Bulletin lately by “Gouger,” told me that
a lady friend who had been in hospital at Cook-
town for Some months had died the previous day.
It was impossible for Peter to know this in an
ordinary way, and it was two days later before the
lady’s friends received news of her death—the first
intimation that had come to Rossville. “Who told
you?” I had asked as we rested after crossing a
rough creek. “Hear-it in scrub yesterday,” he
replied, waving his thin black arm towards the
green depths.

“3556” : “Rosalie” and “Timo” are a long
way out when they class W. R. Carver as the
champion roughrider of Australia. I can name
several who beat Carver. Snowy Baldwin is the
best horseman in Australia—he’s out on his own.
Roy Stanbridge, Harry Hawkins, Jack Dempsey,
Hector Sadler and Bert Fletcher are all better
than Carver ever was. I have seen all of them ride,
and I have also seen Carver thrown by the famous
Bobs. Time, 6 seconds. Place, Moree. Year, 190 C.
Carver also had bad luck when he tried to bridle,
saddle and ride Lance Skuthorp’s horse Cyclops (not
Wild Anglis, as stated by “Timo”). He ended up
in the Inverell hospital with a fractured skull.

“Gagi Highfli”: Aviators in France noted
a tendency in their machines to turn to the right,
especially at high altitudes. On crossing the equator
to Australia they found that the tendency is to turn
to the left. Does any aviating bushwhacker know
the reason?

“Jim Carew”: Many natives from the
tribes around the lower Murray and its tributaries
were expert linguists, and were sent from tribe to
tribe as itinerant human newspapers. These messengers
were a favored lot, and would travel from place to
place, deliver their news to the local skilled linguist,
who would relate it to the crowd while the messenger
was feasted on the best the camp could produce. The
“newspaper,” who always had some bodily marks or
insignia which secured him from molestation, travelled
great distances. The furthest afield I ever met one
was near Mudgee. He belonged to a tribe which had
its headquarters near Overland Corner, on the lower
Murray.

THE OLD HOME STATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
All clay a smoky haze hangs round the station,
No bird or beast is moving on the plain ;
The boss stalks round in restless meditation
Of overdrafts and rain.
Ilis wife sits in the sultry shadows, reading.
Deep lines beneath her eyes, about her mouth ;
Iler heart and sou] for surf and city pleading,
Anc| comforts of the South.
The foliage of the doliclios is dusty,
The creeping roses lose their blooms and wilt;
The garden tools are laid aside and rusty,
Half buried in the silt.
beneath the windmill tank the tap is leaking,
An old sheep-dog lies panting in the drip ;
The iron on the woolshed roof is creaking
Above the season's clip,
Down in the hut the Chinese cook is singing.
Few men are kept, and so his work is light ;
He chuckles while the dinner bell is ringing-
Three men are all in sight.
The bullock team was long ago disbanded, *
The yokes and bows are hanging in the shed :
Two years or more since any calves were branded,
Tlie cows are mostly dead.
Out where the boundary fence is wire-netted
The restless, shifting sands are piling high;
The hillocks that they form are silhouetted
Against the cloudless sky.
The ’lignum in the dried-out swamps is dying,
The hardy saltbush roots are nearly done—
On either hand their fallen leaves are lying
And curling in the sun.
IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS.
BUSHRANGER : “ Hands up! Money or your
life! Come on, now—no nonsense!"
SANDY MCSWATT: “Just let me put ma hand

BUSHRANGER : “No, by --, no! What yo-
n-ant to do that for? No funny business,
now!"
SANDY: “No, Na —I jus' wanna pay ma freed-
here the t[?]a poonds I owe him!"
The ploughs and scoops and poison-carts are idle,
And dusty riding-saddles fill the rail;
And here and there a boundary-rider’s bridle
Is hanging on a nail.
Some swagmen down (lie winding track are tramping,
A cloud of dust is rising from their feet ;
there’s shady bends where they might well be
camping—
They travel in the heat.
And through the dust the Royal Mail is crawling;
Long overdue, it lurches down the range,
M idle loud and clear the driver’s horn is calling
To hail them at the change.
The wheeler rubs his nose against the leader,
Then cleans his dusty eyes on either knee;
Tired out they straggle to the bulging feeder
And eat contentedly.

At night a sudden change comes o’er the station:
The iron roof is flapping on the shed ;
ihe drought has surely reached its destination—-
Two storms meet overhead.

Stump-jump”: A writer in a recent
Bulletin cast doubt on Judge Therry’s assertion
that there were “hundreds” of llamas in Australia
in the ’sixties. Well, I’ll not swear to the year, but
there were some on the well-known Eton Vale run
on the Darling Downs when I was a kid, and I’m
no chicken now. No survivor remains to-day.

Homo”: Passed out at Wangaratta,
Michael lloban, aged 78, a notable drover of the
\ ic. North-East. He landed in Australia at the
age of six, and in the next 70-odd years bad more
mishaps than any Anzac who can tell the tale. Dur-
ing the Kelly era he was obliged to prove him self a
master of diplomacy, in order to avoid the fate
that befell Aaron Sherritt. He thanked his lucky
stars then he had kept locked within his bosom
ceitain testimony he possessed anent missing steers
and poddies of former days. Whenever a railway
accident occurred in the North-East, a more or less
mangled Mkhael was generally fished out from the
wreckage. Thirty-three years ago a train at the
Glenrowan crossing made hash of a score of bullocks
and the horse he was riding. Incidentally, the
FOR BETTER OR WORSE.
THE DRUK : “ S'oright, constable. Gorrer

THE CONTABLE: “ What’s your friend's

THE SAME DRUNK: “Oh, lie's the fellow
that lost it.”
affair cost the Railway Department £3OOO.
Only a degree or two less tragic was a similar en-
counter he had with a train at Moyhu a few weeks
piior to his death. And this was at a time when
he was deemed to be still convalescing from frac-
ture of the skull and concussion of the brain re-
ceived in an argument with a bull, and as the result
of which he lay unconscious in a hospital for over a
week. Apart from once being woodened and left for
dead, about the best of 101 other thrills lie got was
when the horse was swept from under him crossing
the Ovens in the 1917 flood, and some sawmill hands
far downstream, in response to a cry that came
across the waters from a friendly snag, hauled a very
sorry-looking Michael ashore at the end of a rope.
However, he was at the old address next day—in the
saddle. The doctor who was called in at the final
act met him at the front gate. He couldn’t be per-
suaded anybody could ever be ill enough to be in bed.
He was dead next day. Pneumonia.
“Gagi”: “Osprey” (B. 29/4/’2O) informs
intending cannibals that the foot is a delicacy. The
foot and palm of the hand are tough and bitter.
Papuan savages clean, dry and stuff them with
grass. They are carried for tokens and debil-debil
purposes, but are not eaten.
“Scottie the Rake”: Re “Jim Carew’s”
“five most popular bush superstitions” (B. 22/i/’2oy.
(1) “Snakes don’t die till sunset.” During a
residence ,of 23 years among the btishmen of N.Q. 1
never heard it mentioned. I saw a
good many snakes killed during that
time, but nobody seemed to have any
doubt about their being good and
dead when they were left. I’ll admit
N.Q. is only a small part of Australia.
(2) “It is always the night shift at
a mine which finds the rich patches.”
This is not a superstition, but a fact,
especially when the patches are found
in “pockets.” But the afternoon shift
is the best (from 4 p.m. to mid-
night). The results are divided later.
I liked the afternoon shift myself
when the breaking-down looked pro-
mising. (3) “A horse with three
white feet can’t win a race.” I feel
sure this superstition would die of
loneliness if it ever parted with those
who frequent such places as Ascot
and Kedron Park. (4) “Cattle on
camps see ghosts.” I have heard this
many times, and I believe it.' I
am not a very brave man, and, when
camping along the divide of the Gulf
waters, if anything more than a hun-
dred miles from my neighbor I always
slept with the Winchester under the
right-hand edge of my blanket. I
have great faith in a .44, even where
ghosts are concerned. I shot one on
the Clarke River in the “stilly hours,”
and the shock of the bullet turned
him into a pelican. (5) “To find a
corpse in the bush is a sure sign that
the finder will die a violent death.”
He is a stranger where I came from,
and to me,' thank God ; but I stand
with uncovered bead and let him pass.
’Tvvas I who found the dead Chinaman on Fish
Creek.
* # # *
“Bung”: Some years back, whilst earning
a fortune in the overpaid service of the N. S. Wales
Education Department, on the South Coast, I had
at divers times abo. children in regular attendance
at my temple of learning. Almost invariably they
readily became artistic and neat workers, fair readers
and spellers, and very good singers. But not one
piccaninny did I control that ever did much where
concentration of thought was required, and their
memories appeared to be mostly ephemeral. One
boy into whom I stuffed the rudiments for three
or four years became a really superior penman and
draughtsman, and in those branches won prizes by
yards from the many white children competing in
the coastal shows. Long after I saw a letter written
by him. His fist had degenerated to a spidery
scrawl, and in every other respect his missive only
went to show that I had cast more pearls before the
abomination of Israel.
* • #
“Wejssel”: The strangest scarecrow ever
used in Australia, if the old yarns about it are true,
was one put up at the Moreton Bay settlement
in the 'twenties. The abos. would keep stealing the
maize from a crop at Kangaroo Point, on the Bris-
bane River, so finally a blackfellow was shot and
skinned and then stuffed and put up to scare away
the rest. It is alleged that the maize was not
worried afterwards.
* * * *
“Copabella” : A pillar of thick grey smoke
told us a bush-fire had started, and its location in
the hills of Jones’s notoriously “dirty” selection
meant the fire would be a snifter. Cockies for miles
around left their work, caught horses and galloped
for Jones’s hills. Jones was tearing great gaps in
his whiskers in his frenzy of despair. “If it gets
into me brush fences I’m done,” he wailed. “Brush”
is the brand of the sloven and the vermin-breeder,
but we said we would “steer” the fire into the rough
gullies and concentrate on saving the rough breaks
if we could. For three days ten of us belted at
Jones’s fire, Jones serving us with mediocre tucker
and spending most of his time ambling round on
a pony “seein’ she was safe” behind, and seeing
“she wasn't gettin’ away” in front. Meantime we
“steered her” successfully, saving the brush, and
giving Jones a useful elearing-up burn. On the third
day a boundary-rider from the main run rode over
the hills. “What’s on ?” he asked cheerfully. “Sav-
ing poor old Jonesy’s bit o’ a home,” we said,
wiping streaming brows. “Savin’ be blowed!”
retorted the station-hand. “I met Jones rakin’ up
leaves and settin’ ’em alight in the next gully, so
as to steer ’em into his scrubby C.P.!” Then we
went home.
* * * *
“S.S.S.”: Beyond the fourth boatslip on
Thursday Island there is a lonely grave. A woman’s
hand carved in wood, evidently the figurehead of a
ship, marks it. No one knows who lies there- Old
Frank Summers, who has been in Torres Strait
since Valdez del Torres discovered it or thereabouts,
thought he had heard that a deep-sea captain died
off Black Rock and was carried ashore and buried
there with his wife, who died the same day. Gert-
rude Robson, the finest woman God ever made, who
died of missionary zeal in Papua, used to tramp round
there and weed that grave and put flowers on it.
This because it was lonely and of no account. She
always did that which no one else bothered about.
“S.S.S.”: A Vati tana lives high up in a
tree on the bison-backed range that rises between
Ela Beach and Hanuabada (Papua). To some she
is an old, old woman; to others she is young and
very beautiful. Sometimes on a misty dark night
she comes down and walks beside one. This is good
luck. If she should press a something that feels
like sapi-sapi (money) into your palm you will
become rich. Laria, my little Courabada cooky-
boy, told me this. She brought him a pig.
THE CHARGE OF THE TAILOR .
“ Mercy, Kanierad, mercy!"
“Scottie the Rake”: No more Australian
bushmen for me! I thought they were a respectable
lot, but this is what I find in “Everybody's Practical
Encyclopaedia”: “Many savage people expose their
dead to be devoured by wild animals and birds of
prey, a custom still in vogue among the bushmen and
other natives of Australia, who expose their dead
in the limbs of trees.” This interesting work also
sheds some light on kangaroos. “The flesh of these
animals is prized for food, resembling venison.
The kangaroo-rat and kangaroo-bear are other mar-
supials found in Australia and New South Wales.”
Unfortunately, though the work is in two large
volumes, printed on very fine paper, and, I believe,
costs money, there is not a word in it about the
well-known camel-mosquito found in Australia and
Goondiwindi. It was with this remarkable bird that
the Northern tribes maintained an aerial postal ser-
vice long before Ross Smith’s great-grandfather was
born.
* * * *
“W.L.”: A scientific friend of mine has
solved the problem of why the kookaburra is called
the laughing jackass. The kookaburra’s name is
Dacelo gigas {with a soft gto start with). If you
say the “gigas” part carelessly it is as nearly like
“jackass” as a beer is like a shandy.
“Barcoo”: Lack of sleep produces queer
results. Years ago, McPherson, driver for Cobb and
Co. on the coach line between Winton and
Cloncurry (Q.), had to take on the full
trip in and out, which just cut out six
days and nights, owing to his mate at
the Cloncurry end having a broken leg.
He hung on to the ribbons for three
weeks, at the end of which time he had
to be seized and strapped inside the
vehicle. He had developed “dry” horrors
and imagined his coach was a flying
machine. It took four weeks of hospital to fit him
for the box seat again.
“Barcoo”: A Southern bank-clerk was
recently transferred to a fly-, mosquito- and flea-
infested town in AVestern Queensland. Algernon
arrived prepared to cut a dash, and for some weeks
his 18-guinea suits and profiteer shoes caused more
irritation to the eyes of the yokels than did the
flies. Unfortunately, however, he gave the cold
shoulder to a group of shearers —big-cheque lodgers
at his pub. Owing to the scarcity of water and
the absence of a bathroom, etc., a small sft. x sft.
makeshift, of poor-quality hessian, had been erected
in the open some 50 yards from the back of the
hotel. A weekly bath—not transferable —was allowed
each boarder. On Friday morning Algernon, splen-
did in a carpet-patterned bath-robe, strutted majes-
tically to his “tub.” The unusually large crowd
in the yard caused him some wonder but no con-
cern. He hung up his bath-robe and towel and
stood under the shower. After some minutes he
smelt something burning. Horrors! The cheap hes-
sian was blazing on all sides! A thousand shudders
—his garment and towel had disappeared ! It was
impossible to quell the flames. Loud cheers sounded
from without. There was nothing for it but to
run the gauntlet—without even a pocket handker-
chief. Never did a champion sprinter cover 50 yards
through a more enthusiastic crowd.
* * * *
“Horse”: It wasn’t his mother’s Bible,
but a tobacco-tin in his left-hand shirt pocket, that
saved James Sanderson from severe injuries, if not
from death. Sanderson, who is a farmer at Wood-
lands, near Yeppoon (Q.), was yarding cattle, when
a young bull turned on him and knocked him down
and out. Later it was found that one of the
animal’s horns had gone right through the tobacco-
tin. Its force was then spent, and the body about
the heart was only bruised instead of being horribly
torn. Still, as it was, the smash carried Sanderson
into the hospital at Yeppoon.
* * * *
“Caloola”: Anyone know a sudden-death
cure for bot-flies ? I have a useful nag which is
looking pretty sick, and a bush vet. has diagnosed
bot grubs, and comforted me with the news that the
nag’s days are numbered. Bran mashes, turps and
milk and such remedies have been tried, but they
only seem to feed the tormentors.
* * * *
“Ace o’ Hearts”: I am an invalid and
occupy a hut built at the corner of the verandah.
Each day a mountain-lark visits me and inspects the
room for dead flies and candle-ends. Yesterday he
got a shock. He flew on to my dressing-table right
in front of my shaving mirror. Seeing his reflection
he commenced to show himself off much as a manne-
quin would a dress. He stalked the whole length of
the dressing-table, returning to the mirror each
time. Finally he commenced to chatter to the
reflection and finished with a beautiful clear call.
He eventually gave it up as a bad job. A dog
placed in front of a mirror will ignore his reflec-
tion. The American novelist and dog expert, Pay-
son Terhune, says this is because the dog’s abnor-
mal sense of smell tells him there is no dog there.
Should we infer the opposite in the foregoing inci-
dent, which, by the way, occupied about five
minutes ?
“3x2”: A farmer living here (Mackay, Q.)
had a cow with a three-weeks-old calf; and, although
the calf was locked up every night, the mother was
always quite dry at milking-time in the morning.
Various guesses were made, but the mystery was
not solved until early one morning. Strawberry
was found contentedly spread out in the yard and
a litter of pigs at work on the reservoir.
* * * »
“Jim Carew” : Many of the native names
given to places are queer corruptions of the originals.
“Gabo’’ is really the result of Binghi’s attempt to
pronounce the already-given name, Cape Howe.
“Harrow,” a place about 50 miles west of Port
Lincoln (S.A.), should be Werraw (t.e., gum-leaves).
The last gum-trees for nearly 1000 miles along the
coast are found there. There are hundreds of
similar corruptions, probably due .to the tact that
the first men to hear the native names were bush-
men who took the line of least resistance, like
the bookies do with the names of horses.
* * * »
“Doxite”: The next time an Abo. spud-
grower finds a wombat entangled in his wire-netting
let him split its hide into bootlaces, and I’ll guar-
antee them to be in the bloom of youth when the
hoof-covers are passing out from senile decay.
LONG ODDS.
CABBY (to motor-car driver who has humped
into his horse): “Ah, per blanky coward!
Forty against one!”
“Coolabah”: Any Abo. able to give a
remedy for bad founder in a pony mare, 15 years
old ? The first signs appeared about 15 months ago.
She got very bad, but recovered after treatment till
last December. Then she gradually got worse, and
has kept on doing it. She now has great difficulty
in walking and especially in turning. We’ve fed
her on dry chaff, as, owing to severe drought, there
is absolutely no natural feed.
THE MARRYING PARSON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A minister of to-day in many eases must choose
debt, celibacy or a rich wife.” —Confession at a
Congregational Union meeting.
“1 offer you my hand and name,”
Exclaimed the kneeling pastor.
Her features lit up like a flame,
Her heart had ne’er beat faster.
“He loves me then,
This best of men,”
She thought, and pressed his hand again.
“I cannot say I love you, dear,
Or that for you I’m dying;
It is not true to have you near
I constantly am sighing;
But I am poor
,And, darling, your
Fat fortune would my lot secure.”
She turned on him the flash of hate.
“You’d for my money wed me?”
“If you’d put plenty in the plate
To feed, and clothe and bed me
I could not see
The need to be
A Benedict at all,” said he.
“You’ll think, it now occurs to me,
My proposition funny;
But clergymen continually
Are marrying for money.
I in this quest
Obey the best
Professional usage, I protest.”

A Plain
Fact!
w.
got busy. At his reception ball everybody who
was anybody was present. Of course all
wore Bluebirds. Over one hundred million
dollars’ worth of jewels adorned the gowns.
Next night an immense audience assembled
in the great Metropolitan Opera House to
witness the initial performance of “The
Bluebird” in a grandnopera setting. As
usual, when the curtain rung down on the
last act the seat-holders called for a speech,
but Maurice gracefully bowed and declined.
Just as well. His opening lecture in Car-
negie Hall a week later was a farce. It
dealt with spiritualism, and nobody under-
stood it. He called the lecture “The Un-
known Shore.” It was less shore than bore,
lie attempted to deliver it in English; and
the only English he knew was what he had
picked up in crossing the Atlantic. He had
dictated his address in French to a stenog-
rapher, who in turn translated it into per-
fectly good Anglo-Saxon, and proceeded to
teach it to him. Unfortunately the lessons
were given in phonetics. To make a long
story short (hang the phrase!), the Belgium
poet started out bravely enough, but he had
scarcely passed the “Ladies and gentlemen”
when there was trouble, and lots of it. The
great audience held its breath, listened,
strained, wondered f and then a lady in the
middle of the hall rose to her feet and called
out, “Mr. Maeterlinck, we don’t know what
on earth you are talking about; won’t you
please lecture in French?” "Yes, yes,
French,” chimed in a chorus of voices. But
the bulk of the audience could not under-
stand French, and that also had to be aban-
doned. The chairman then announced he
would act as interpreter. Maeterlinck reeled
off a couple of sentences, which were imper-
fectly translated. This lasted about five
minutes, and then the poet, the chairman
and the audience all got horribly mixed up.
The creator of the “Bluebird” tore at his
long hair, and cursed picturesquely; the
amateur interpreter looked puzzled ; and the
audience mumbled and then laughed. The
upshot of it all was the chairman read the
lecture in English from the manuscript,
after which the audience went home, of
course disappointed. Next day the bureau
cancelled the remaining lectures; and
Maeterlinck crossed the continent to Califor-
nia. At present he is living with his wife
at Los Angeles, where he will remain a year
writing and studying the movie art. Yet
Bluebirds are still all the rage. Some of
the big New York department stores are
advertising “Bluebird lingerie.” Which is the
proof.
Unlike the Belgian, Vincente Blasco
Ibanez, though also unable to speak English,
has made a decided hit everywhere. The
great Spanish author has three assets con-
spicuously lacking in Maeterlinck —a wonder-
ful personality, a splendid interpreter, and
an extraordinary amount of commonsense.
Although once gaoled in his own country for
socialism, he has no time for the reds. I
understand his next book will be woven
around President Wilson. If so it will have
but a poor sale over here. Ibanez, speak-
ing in the Quaker city of Philadelphia, said:
“American men ought to treat their wives a
little rougher. American women are sick of
being toadied to. Every woman likes a little
bit of the cave stuff now and then.”
Truly remarkable is the fame Lord Dun-
sany has achieved over here as a dramatist.
He is better liked than any of his English
contemporaries: and in London he is practi-
cally unknown. His plays were first pro-
duced in the States at The Little Theatre,
where they were a sensation. His lecture
tour was a distinct success. A poor speaker,
he nevertheless pleased his audiences, and
further endeared himself to the American
literary world.
Another English poet and dramatist to win
laurels in U.S.A., and to win them in the
most emphatic way, is John Drinkwater,
whose "Abraham Lincoln,” following its
success on the London stage, has ripped
Broadway up the back. On three different
occasions I have endeavored to obtain seats
for four; and three times the ticket clerk
said the same thing: “Sorry, there is nothing
left; you will have to book a week ahead.
At last, determined not to leave Gotham
without first seeing it, I went alone and
managed to secure a single seat, well back.
The ex-rail-splitter is America’s most beloved
character—held dearer than Washington or
Roosevelt; and it took an English poet of
the younger school to dramatise him to the
taste of the American public.
And yet another (in truth the modern
English drama is conquering the States),
St. John Irvine, has “hit the high spots” with
his dramatic tragedy, “John Ferguson.” This
production was staged by The Equity, an
actors’ association ; and, although billed for
one week, it ran over eight. Undoubtedly
the actors’ strike, in closing the opposition
houses, helped its success considerably ; but
with or without the strike it would have
“gone big,” as it has real merit. St. John
was in England, and almost penniless, when
lie received the cable announcing its Broad-
way success. To-day he is over here lectur-
ing for big money; and all the time the play
royalties are pouring in.
John Masefield’s new poem, “Reynard the
Fox,” is already in its tenth edition. Kipling’s
new book of verse, “The Years Between.”
is also a sensational success. Although
only off the presses a few months, its sales
have easily passed those of the incomparable
“Kim.” Kipling’s royalties for last year
exceeded those for any previous 12 months
of his writing career. His collected poems,
in one volume, are now on the market for
the first time. An edition de luxe (auto-
graphed) is being eaten up at £l4 a volume.
Mark Twain’s royalties also beat all
previous records last year. The pub-
lishers handed the executors of his estate
a cheque for £25,000 for royalties for
1920.
The German gringoes and junkers are
daring to yelp again; and we have “Luden-
dorff’s Own Story” and “The Memoirs of
Yon Tirpitz.” They are both amusing. The
General admits that he is the best strategist
on earth; and the Admiral candidly con-
fesses that no better sea fighter than him-
self ever lived. Nest we are to hear from
the Crown Prince, who is b»sy with the
goose-quill.
ToOM SHEYHILL.
Marcus Clarke and History
Marcus Clarke's ‘'Term of His Natural
Life” is responsible for a lot of distorted
conceptions of the early history of Australia.
The more one studies the actual records the
more evident it is that his picture give®
false ideas. In the first place, it is not fair
to judge the individuals of those days from
the standpoint of these days; they should
Tse measured not by what Australia is now,
but by what Britain was then. And the
fact stands out that the general run of the
men transported to Australia were so much
better off here than they would have been
in England that transportation, as officials
complained, soon lost all its terrors. More,
ns the case of Thompson and Sudds proved
in Governor Darling’s time, soldiers some-
times reckoned that the convicts, with the
chance of speedily becoming emancipists and
getting land grants, were actually better off
than they, and committed felonies for the
sole purpose of graduating into the favored
class. It is, of course, true that even the
mildest of officials were ready to order con-
victs to the triangles and the lash on very
little provocation ; but when “Botany Bay”
was founded, one of the official formulae in
England with regard to women prisoners
was that they be flogged “till their bodies
be bloody.” Naturally enough, “settlements
of secondary punishment,” like Macquarie
Harbor, Port Arthur, Norfolk Island and,
in their earlier stages, Newcastle, Moreton
Bay and Port Macquarie, were not Sunday-
school picnics. But it is doubtful if they
were any worse than those “floating hells,”
the English prison hulks, or than some of
the English gaols. Moreover, it must be
borne in mind that these places were the
receptacles for offenders who had been given
a chance and been convicted again. I made
diligent inquiry among “old hands” who
served time at Maria Island (Tas.) and at
Port Arthur, and they admitted that if a
man did not “point” and tried to behave
decently the authorities gave him a chance.
The worst part of the punishment was the
association with some of the brute beasts
with whom they were herded. That there
was a deal of hideous immorality, of cruelty
and of wickedness inextricably entwined
with the “system” is true. But that does
not warrant the uncritical acceptance of
wrong or only partially-true accounts, and
building history upon it.
D.F.
A Satchel of Books
The Strange Case of Mr. Jocelyn Them,
by E. Phillips Oppenheim (Hodder and
Stoughton, London). The usual mystery
story with an elaborate and breathless plot.
Well enough done, but in no way believable.
Sisters, by Kathleen Norris (John Mur-
ray, London). There is a. good deal of
charm about this book, in which two sisters
get mixed in their love and matrimonial
affairs. One is killed in a motor accident,
and after that the yarn rages out into melo-
drama. Holds the interest to a point.
The Wanderers, by Mary Johnston (Con-
stable, London). This is a series of yarns
running from the days of the “tree folk”
to those of the French Revolution. The
history of mankind from the woman’s point
of view is thus built up step by step. All
the chapters are interesting, and some are
particularly well done.
Hearts' Haven, by C. L. Burnham (Con-
stable, London). This is an American story
and very charming. It is largely a book of
good people, and the gossipy village is full
of kindness. The heroine is a bright little
grandmother of 47 who picks up an old love
affair in a happy and natural way. The
characters are excellently drawn, and there
is a thin stream of real humor.
The Immortal Flame, by Marie Bjelke
Peterson (Harper, New York). An alleged
Australian yarn in which our high societv
moves through a strange jumble of mixed
seasons and geographical chaos. A lord and
another less tremendous person pursue the
beautiful heroine from London to Australia ;
and there_ is a house-party at which the.
Governor is heard to make a weird remark
about Australia from a sort of throne among
palms.. The wicked lord turns religious, and
the real lovers get to grips in a wild and
ferocious delirium of ecstasy which goes on
at top heat of inanity for many pages. The
story might pass in its rather lurid class
if it were not for the absurd setting in Aus-
tralia. Rome in the time of Nero might
have suited it better.
William Butters is. as usual, up to time
with Australia's Official Welcome to H.R.H.
the Prince of Wales. He begins in a vein
of reassurement: —
Time was when ruler’s son unwelcome came:
Such happeneth not to Ours.
Once, quite necessity for armed guard in band
To watch, protect, ensure.
Such sure hath passed; to us and ours unknown.
A point is settled which has been debated
with a good deal of heat in certain bars:—
Of Wales the Prince! Of us not less than Wales;
And greeted well as such.
Of us quite one? Quite, quite one;
By all thus recognised.
A. master of vers Hire, William pro-
vides more highly-remunerated laureates
with a good example of promptitr.de and a
contempt for the ca’ canny spirit in litera-
ture.
After a suspension of business for nearly
three years, due first to the v. v. and then
to the precedence given by the X. S. Wales
Government printing office to the job of
getting out the State rolls, the library com-
mittee of the Commonwealth Parliament has
published the 12th volume of the first series
of The Historical Records of Australia. Its
805 pages include the despatches to and from
the Governor for a period of 18 months only,
the last half of 1825 and the whole of 1826.
At that rate the editor (Dr. Fred Watsbn)
will need seven more volumes to give the
despatches down to 1887. There are several
other series, some of them containing much
valuable material, to be dealt with. There is
exploration, there are the papers dealing
with the out-settlements, Van Diemen’s
Land, Moreton Bay, etc.; a series on legal
matters; another on Church and State and
religious questions. Agriculture and indus-
try, too, might have a series of its own.
Governor Darling’s despatches in Vol. 12
show him in a rather better light than he
is usually seen in. He is far from being as
great a figure as Macquarie: he was a
martinet, and of formal and narrow mind.
Yet he was honest according to his lights, a
hard worker, and he did his bit, too, to
secure all Australia for the British race.
When he sent Major Loekyer, whose family
is still represented in Australia by N. R.
Loekyer, late of the Interstate Commission,
to found at King George’s Sound the first
regular settlement in Westralia, he put for-
ward the first official claim to the whole of
Australia. Historians sometimes attribute
the first making of this claim to Captain
Stirling when he landed at the Swan River
in 1529, but it is clear that Darling was
attending to that job in 1526.
The Inky Way
Martin Donohoe, the Australian-born war
correspondent, has added the Military Cross,
the Star of Roumania and the Roumanian
Military Commemoration Cross to his deco-
rations.
Something unique was sold in London
lately—the first-edition “Endymion” pre-
sented by Keats to Shelley, and inscribed
“P. R. Shelley, Esq., with J.K.’s sincere
regards.” It brought 210 guineas.
Editor Ainge-Johnson, the bright young
man who used to toil for the Argus and for
a time ran Melbourne Graphic, is to attend
to the revival of Melbourne Punch, with a
substantial amount of cash at call to assist
his efforts.
“Chev” : England’s most popular writer on
finance, Chiozza Money, during his recent
campaign as Labor candidate for Stockport
(he was not successful, by the way) was
heckled by a cheap allusion to his Italian
origin. “Where’s your monkey?” roared the
heckler. “It wasn’t necessary to bring it,”
Money retorted promptly, looking in liis
enemy’s direction.
The Poetry Society of Adelaide has cele-
brated its 10th year of existence by giving
the master-minds a rest for one evening and
looking around for home talent. Nearly a
dozen local versifiers —the sexes about evenly
divided —were found to submit, more or less
blushingly, their own work. Dr. C. H.
Soiiter (“Nil”) is the best known of them.
He didn’t blush. He didn’t need to.
“Biography”: Walter Murdoch, the Pro-
fessor of English at Perth, formerly of Mel-
bourne University, is hard at work compiling
the life of the late Alfred Deakin to the
taste of the trustees. The work must leave
out a good deal, and will be interesting as
showing how much it lifts the veil on
spiritualism as practised side by side with
politics. It would have Imen much more
readable if the compiler had been left with
a free hand.
Archibald Strong has had the job of
writing a hymn of welcome to the Prince.
One can imagine him, sitting down with a
few strands of sparse hair clutched in either
hand, running over his rhymes: “Before the
day and since”.... “Friend and foe con-
vince”.... “Shall not fail nor wince”....
mince, quince, rinse—tut, tut! Only three
possible verses and all the rhymes gone!
Here y’are, then, drat it:—
Thou know’st that in Empire’s day
We shall not fail nor wince;
So take to England’s heart and thine
Our love and homage, Prince!”
It seems rather an inadequate and school-
boyish effort to crown the lifework of a
real doctor of letters.
Harry J. Stephens, for 14 years editor of
the Farmer and Settler, leaves Sydney to
take the chair of a new daily at Mildura.
The papers there have been amalgamated
and fresh capital pumped in, so presently
the inland city will be talking back in a
louder tone to the bloated coast capitals.
Stephens goes with a hatful of good wishes
and a presentation case of cutlery, the gift
of the Chums Fraternity.
“Baree”: Re the American short story
again. In one of the greater magazines I
have just read :
Her breath sounded in his ear like gouts of blood.
Laughter dropped from her lips like a dead bird.
Wait till my genuine Australian novel sees
the light. I transcribe a passage or two: —
She kookaburraed her joy. Her lips quivered like
a blue-tongucd lizard. The dingo-cry in her voice
reached his heart.
“S.T.S.”: One of Norman Lindsay’s Bul-
letin cartoons figures in Locke’s new novel.
“The House of Baltazar.” It is imagined
that the scholarly hero had so shut himself
up that two years after the war began he had
never heard of it; and when he was brought
up to date he needed to be convinced that his
old scientific friends in Germany sided with
the Kaiser. So :—•
The doctor brorp! t him one of the great cartoons
of the war, which he had cut from some paper and
kept, by Norman Lindsay, the great Australian
black-and-white artist—the “Jekvll and Hyde” car-
toon, representing a typical benevolent elderly Ger-
man professor regarding himself in a mirror; and
the reflection was a gorilla in Prussian spiked helmet
and uniform dripping with blood. And then Balta-
zar’s blood curdled in his veins as he realised the
truth of the picture. All the mighty intellectuali-m
of Germany was but an instrument of its gorilla
animalism. It was an overwhelming revelation.
Strange that he had not thought of it before!
“Macquarie Street” considers his shelves:
“S.T.S.” (B. 25/4/’2O) remarks on the increased
value, as time goes on, of first editions. It is quite
the reverse with medical and surgical works, even
when they have been written by the most illustrious
physicians and surgeons, and even when they hare
become classic. For instance, I have the first edition
of Sir Lauder Brunton's treatise on “The Disorders
of Digestion,” which contains many valuable hints
on treatment of use even in these mad jazzy days,
although the book was published in 1886. It is
handsomely bound and cost me 10s. 6d. I don't
suppose anyone would give me 2s. for it, but I
think it must have reached the depths of degrada-
tion in Paris. The authoress of “Paris Through
an Attic” says that her husband was ill, and that
she cured him by perusing the work of Brillat-
Savarin, which she purchased on a Paris quay for
2d., along with Lauder Brunton’s famous work, which
she found uncut on the same quay, and was able to
pick up for 4d. Three hundred and seventy pages
of the best therapeutic lore that England could pro-
duce going for 4d.!

“Boolambayte”: How’s this for intense
cultivation? At Maitland, on the Bolwarra
flats, a farmer this season grew tomatoes for
the early Sydney market and cleared £1326
from nine acres. Six miles away, on the banks
of the Paterson, his brother grew the same
vegetable, and from a five-acre patch cleared
£129 per acre. And both of them are saying,
“But wait until next season.”

A mean citizen of Sydney, with no con-
sideration for the conscientious burglar, has
found a new use for iron safes. Thieves
broke into his house, took the safe out bodily,
prised it open in an adjoining paddock, and
got nothing for their pains. The house-
holder had hidden his money and his wife’s
jewellery under the mattress of his bed, leav-
ing the safe’ an empty bait for Bill Sikes.

“Adelaide”: The Tramways Trust build-
ing, which threatens to be the highest and
handsomest in the city, is to go up on a Vic-
toria-square frontage, after all. The City
Council, which had refused leave, chopped
round after hearing much argument, and
authorised it almost unanimously. The idea
is welcomed by the Central Traders’ Associa-
tion, which is working to make the

“Ragar”: “R.S.V.P.” asks (B. 8/4/’2O)
how much ginger Australia produces. I
haven’t heard of her producing any—com-
mercially. But she can do it with the best
of ’em. I have grown it myself on an island
up north where I was tied for a time, and
was satisfied that it’s a good thing. The
natives grow it on pretty well all the Torres
islands in small quantities, but don’t use
it much. We import a host of things that
we are too bone-headed, tired or darned
superior to make and grow, and ginger’s one
of ’em.

A decision of the N. S. Wales Full Court
has made a hole in the Licensing law. A
publican appealed against a conviction for
Sunday selling on the ground that there
was no evidence that he knew anything
about the transaction and that he could not
be held responsible for the acts of an em-
ployee not authorised to sell liquor. It was
argued that, the liquor having been handed
out by a servant who had no authority to
sell, any action lay against that servant for
selling liquor without a license and the
Bung could not be involved. The Court’s
concurrence was probably all right; but it
is going to make things a lot easier for the
law-breaking pub-keeper.

“Vitam”: The so-called “truck shortage”
on the Vic. railways is largely due to fumb-
ling. Here’s an instance. On April 7 there
were two sheep-trucks in the Horsham yard.
A friend who wished to send two trucks of
sheep away for agistment brought the mob
in and went to see the people in the office,
only to be told that he could not load them
until permission had been obtained from
Melbourne. “When can I know?” he asked.
“Oh, some time to-day,” was the reply. The
reply came in due course stating the sheep
could be trucked on the 14th—seven days
later. The two empty trucks stood idle in
the yard for the remaining seven days, and
as the sheep were in weak condition they
had to be hand-fed. But that was not the
end. On the 13th two more empty sheep-
trucks arrived, so my friend loaded one of
the fresh ones and one of the old originals.

“Murkah” on the development of wireless:
The “Four sevens” patent quoted by “Covale” (B.
22/4/’2O) to support his claim that Marconi invented
wireless really belongs to Nikola Tesla, of U.S.A.
But Tesla proposed to use it for wireless transmis-
sion of power instead of signals. His backers re-
fused to be mixed up with so fanciful a scheme, and
Tesla dropped the idea. That he was no mere
visionary was proved some time later when he burnt
out a motor seven miles from his laboratory. Acci-
dent though it was, it proved that power can be
sent through the air. Some day ships and aeroplanes
will be driven by power-plants on shore. “Covale”
crashed badly w'hen he stated that the Belloni-Tossi
direction-finder has been made a standard fitting on
board ships. Instead, on account of its clumsiness —
it needed much intricate machinery and an indepen-
dent aerial outside the cabin —it has been discarded
and the American Navy Department type developed.
For this type a six-foot loop of wire in the cabin
is all that is required for an aerial, while the
ordinary receiving-set is used. The loop of wire is
rotated on a turn-table with a pointer. Sigs. are
strongest when the loop faces the sending station.
At Sydney Observatory recently tests were made
with Kavite, in the Philippines. His direction as
discovered by wireless coincided precisely with that
previously worked out by mathematics and compass.
Lyons (France) was then “shot,” and the position
of Sydney proved by wireless. The so-called Fleming
valve was discovered by Edison about 1884 and
used by Fleming from about 1907. He did abso-
lutely nothing to improve it, and it was not till
De Forest, of U.S.A., made a totally new discovery
that the 10,000-mile ranges of to-day became pos-
sible. Marconi did not invent wireless; he commer-
cialised it.
THE GREAT REFORM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
H I were Premier of New South Wales
I’d take the railways in my special charge.
I could not guarantee that peacock tails
Of joy should wag o’er profits fine and large,
Nor would I undertake that trucks should be
Standing in thousands all about the land ;
But I would go as far as I could see,
And do the thing that I could understand.
The fares? Oh no, the fares would have to stay
Much as they are at present, I'm afraid ;
And various lines that would not, could not, pay
I would not pledge my honor to have made.
I would not flog to speed the slow express;
I could not hope to run all trains to time;
One great and lasting wrong I would redress
And save my brother souls from thinking crime.
1 could not make the railway sandwich smell
Much younger than the ham its stale slabs hold;
I could not bid the carriage spread and swell
When heavy passengers their fat unrolled.
One thing alone I would attempt to an—
and statesman’s act, a bold and splendid stroke,
A great reform to true occasion true —
I’d make the women in the smoker smoke!

CURSE O’MOSES.


Carelessness about one’s personal
condition is the cause of much of
the distress and the source of a
large part of the serious complaints which to-day
contribute to ill-health. Constipation is at the bottom
of nine-tenths of all the ailments from which we
suffer, and is more the result of carelessness and
laziness than from any other cause.
To maintain a healthy system the bowels should
operate at least once every 24 hours. This is one
of Nature’s wise provisions which is too often
ignored, and the result is untold suffering. Women
and children are the greatest offenders, but why such
should be the case is a problem to be solved.
Nature often requires a little assistance, and if this
assistance is given at the first indication much distress and
■ • >■>
suffering may be averted. Mothers, especially, should guard the
health of their children, and inculcate regular habits from infancy.
There is within the reach of all a splendid remedy in
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, sold at a reasonable price. They
will keep the system in perfect working order, and will prevent
many of the serious and costly illnesses if taken when the first
signs of Constipation appear. With Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
at hand, using a little care and intelligence the system can be
kept in a sound and healthy condition.

The Adelaide lawyers who have been, but
are no longer, partners of Josiah Symon are
a numerous crowd. Their number is swelled
by Edward Povey, a rising man who was a
junior partner in the Symon firm till last
week, but is now head of a new combina-
tion, t'ovey, Blackburn (the V.C. and
M.L.A.) and Waterhouse.
Labor declares that sooner or later Prah-
ran (Vic.) must be captured, by it. but appa-
rently it is more intent upon scoring late
than soon. Parker, who, like Guppy, is
“in the law,” has been picked to do battle
with Donald Mackinnon at the coming gen-
eral election; and no gun of lesser calibre
than George Elmslie is likely to make him
shift his Dosition.
“Hamer”: Travelling in Italy Monty
Grover tasted a liqueur made from the leaves
of the Australian gum-trees planted near
Rome. He need not have gone to Italy for
a discovery like that. A secretive old chap
living, near Walcha (N.S.W.), in a shanty
full of books and curios, introduced me to
some very agreeable liqueur which had been
distilled from local gum leaves.
“Peter”: When our village started decorat-
ing for the Princelet’s visit, Swig, our tailor,
ordered an imposing gilt ICII DIEN and
personally hoisted it over his shop, letter by
letter, with a short ladder and a long thirst.
It was almost a.s far to the roof as it was
to the pub opposite, and towards the middle
of the job Swig alternated the journeys with
awful results to the German language. His
motto, HIC DIEN, had remained unimproved
when I passed the other day, and I trust it
will stay there to compensate Edward for
the hollow solemnity of more formal wel-
comes.
For the first time in the present session
a member has quoted verse in the House
of Reps. The member was Edmund Jowett,
and the quotation a moss-grown couplet from
Wordsworth:—•
The world is too much with us. Late and soon,
Getting and spending we lay waste our powers.
“Our Governments are too much with
us,” droned the rich squatter who has joined
the Cocky-chaff party. “Getting and spend-
ing they lay waste our powers.” But the
effect of Jowett’s excursion into poetry was
like the result of throwing stones into a
certain sort of geyser, the member for Gram-
pians having to make the remainder of his
remarks under a crossfire of interjections
which continued joyfully throughout his
effort.
“FY7”: The new Queensland Land
(Amendment) Act, known to the Opposition
as “the Repudiation Act,” got in its first
punch a few days ago, when it landed a heavy
right into the teeth of the Australian Pas-
toral Co. Ltd. This concern is about the
biggest thing of its kind —paid capital is
£932,500 —and its shares are mostly held by
absentees. Its influence was once very great:
the extension of the border railway from Texas
to Dirranbandi, through a big block of its
properties, was its big coup. This block runs
from Surat over the N.S.W. border to Angle-
dool and comprises some 20-odd runs. The
amending Act cancelled the old provision that
second-term rentals could not be increased
by more than 50 p.c. Land-Court Judge
Shannon bumped them from £3 11s. to £6
per sq. mile for Cubbie, one of the biggest
runs. Hollymount, Noondoo and others have
had theirs doubled or more than doubled. Bul-
lamon, which was, years ago, bad pear coun-
try, is the only instance where the rents
asked for by the Crown were not exceeded
by the Court.
“First Mate”: During the last seamen’s
strike the coasters signed on some ragtime
crews. There was the usual sprinkling of
broken-down actors, ex-bankclerks, at least
one ex-bookmaker, and several punters. They
were all amusing, but Buck stood in a class
of his own. At Moruya (N.S.W.) we were
taking in a big load of 141 b. cheeses, and
Buck's job was to catch them as they rolled
down the shoot and pass them along. The
end of the shoot was about Oft. from tin*
bottom of the hold and just in line with
Buck’s head. By 10 p.m. over 5000 had
come down and the crew were ready to
swear off cheese for the rest of their lives.
As there were still a thousand or so to be
loaded the skipper called for more speed,
and the “grindstones” began to come down
so fast that Buck missed one. It didn’t
miss Buck. It caught him on the chin
dimple and laid him out. Just as he was
coming to the skipper put his head over to
ask what was up. “What’s up!” wailed
Buck. “Fourteen pounds of concentrated
cow ’orned me, that’s all!” Then, as an
afterthought, “And I suppose if a man
went into a shop in Melbourne to buy one
of the blankv things they’d charge him a
quid and tell him how blinkin’ scarce they
were!”
“Gunner” : “He made me uncomfortable.”
lan Hamilton complains, of a journalist, in
his just-published diary, "by an elaborate
explanation of why his duty to Australia
could be better done with the pen than with
the rifle.” This very common habit was one
of the minor horrors of the war. The odd
thing about it was that the provider of the
apologia generally managed to make his com-
batant hearer feel a rather unworthy charac-
ter. Perhaps the worst offenders were
junior staff-officers and n.c.o.’s in back areas.
Their point was that an excess of intellect
had ruined them—that if they were only
clods and dullards no objection would be
taken to their ambition to plunge into
action and prove themselves so many
Murrays and Jackas. There was an adju-
tant at one of the Lark Hill camps who
pointed out to the officer-members of pretty
well every departing draft that nothing but
his soldierly qualities kept him on home
service. Amateurs were good enough for
cannon fodder: the real soldiers bad to
undertake the more responsible duties of
administration and training. And then there
was the civilian eligible -who more or less
subtly suggested that his friends had
enlisted in a spirit of vulgar theatricalism.
“Of course no one’s afraid ,” the non-starter
would argue. “Absolutely absurd to talk of
such a thing. But some of us have respon-
sibilities and respect them: and others don’t
seem to care a damn about their obliga-
tions.” The effect was to make the un-
analytical recruit feel rather like a detected
wife-deserter.

You Can Expect Immediate Benefits
IT will undoubtedly require
several months for you to
experience in full the advan-
tages of Goodyear Tyres.
The greater mileages they de-
liver, their slow and obstinate
wear in everyday service?
their consistent freedom from
trouble —these can be learned
properly only over a long
period of use.
But there are other advan-
tages, perhaps no less impor-
tant, from which you can
expect immediate benefits.
The superior comfort and
safety of Goodyear Tyres, the
riding ease they add to every
motor car, the distinction
their fitting imparts and the
security from trouble they in-
sure—these are benefits you
will appreciate in the first
mile of travel, and continue
to enjoy.
From every standpoint, Good-
year Tyres are the most effi-
cient, economical and satis-
factory tyres on this market.
They are made in both

“Euro Yoroke”: The word “union” is
gradually falling into disuse amongst union-
ists at Melbourne Trades Hall. No delegate
on the council ever refers to his “union”
now. It is called by a number of names,
but is generally an “organisation.”
Occasionally it is a “society,” and one dele-
gate always refers to “my show.” To new
chums, until they are. sufficiently educated
to speak of the “organisation,” it is the
“cloob.”
“Prophet Here”; I hold a South Aus. wine
license and retail wine in minimum quart
lots. All the travellers for the manufacturers
bobbed up in turn this week with each and
every one the painful story that owmg to
the increase in the cost of sugar they were
reluctantly compelled to notify an increase in
all wines. The cheapest l.ne I stock, and
which the horrible increase in sugar affected,
is labelled “(Guaranteed 10 years old” and the
other lines from 10 to 23 years—all nice
bright labels too.
Fiji folk raise their hats *to Everard im
Thurn, their once Governor. When the Ist
Contingent went to England he offered him-
self as godfather to the men, and subse-
quently to all who professed themselves kai
Viti, whatever their rank or regiment. For
four years he was at the mercy of excited
boys in London and fed-up men in France;
but whether they wanted socks or a commis-
sion or news from home or the needful for
a jag, im Thurn never failed them. Ilis
wife ran him a close second.
“0.K.”: The last time I yarned with
George Steward he was still secretary to the
G.-G., and was suffering in spirit from the
poison that Queensland politicians were talk-
ing about the war. Recently back from
Queensland, Steward told how the why and
wherefore of the war was being explained
by local representative men to their dupes.
A member of the Ministry assured a public
meeting that when Billy Hughes had de-
nuded the country of all its able-bodied men
the capitalists would flood the land with
colored labor, according to the terms of the
great conspiracy, and as many Australian
boys as survived the artful struggle would
return home to find their womenkind in the
arms of Chinamen. In response to my stare
of incredulity Steward said: “I heard him
say it. 1 was one of the audience.”
There is a belief in China that revolutions
and such-like disturbances last about 10
years, and it is borne out by what reliable
Chinese history there is. Lately there was
held in Sydney a conference of Chinese re-
publicans from the whole of Oceania. The
object was to weld all the.republican societies
into one organisation, so that they might
speak and act with the best effect. Maybe the
fact that October, 1921, will end the tenth
year of the present revolutionary struggle
had nothing to do with this meeting in Syd-
ney; but as similar steps are being taken in
other parts of the world, it looks as if the
republicans are uneasy and want to make
sure that this revolution will nrovide an
exception to the rule. Japan is eager to
help ; but knowing the price that would ulti-
mately be paid for such aid, even the reac-
tionaries are patriotic enough to prefer the
success of the republicans.
“Hamfat” : Though the M.L. Government
considers that it is not empowered to exclude
Asiatics who are British subjects, it has
already legislated to exclude British subjects
who are Australians. In 1903, owing to the
stranding of many theatrical cos., it put
through an Act designed to compel visiting
theatrical managers to deposit on landing
sufficient money to pay the passages of their
members back to the place whence they
came. It was a weak Act, and Charles Hol-
loway, the first it touched, broke a hole
through it by sending his people across to
Auckland as individuals and forming the
co. there. Exclusion \vas not aimed at, of
course; the object being merely to prevent
the stranding of Thespians. But the Gov-
ernment might easily put a bar against in-
swarming Asiatics by declaring that they
must deposit, before entry, sufficient to cover
their return fares.
“Greentape”: Donald Mackinnon had a
chance to take the Premiership of Vic. in
1914, when Peacock succeeded Watt, but he
held nack and contented himself with the
Attorney-Generalship. In 1904 he was
Opposition leader, but after the general elec-
tion led his party into the Corner. Bent
called the group the Victorian Eleven in
allusion to its number. There are things
more impossible than Mackinnon becoming
Premier now. If anyone had tipped
O’Loghlen as head of the Government in
1880 or Bent early in 1903 he would have
been laughed at; yet each did become Pre-
mier. Mackinnon is at least as well quali-
fied as O’Loghlen and Bent, and his pre-
sidency of the Melbourne Club does not pre-
vent his being elected member for very demo-
cratic Prahran—facts which seriously dis-
count the value of the statement of “Another
Old Parliamentary Hand” (B. 29/4/’2O).
“The Immature Male”: The talkative man,
accompanied by a saturnine friend and a
quart of prawns, zig-zagged along the deck of
the Manly boat and flopped into a vacant
seat. As we glided past Farm Cove he
became, if possible, more garrulous. “There
she is,” he said proudly, pointing a prawn,
“Thash ’er, th’ bes’ liT d’stroyer on th’ ’Stra-
lian station.” He glared around belligerently,
as if seeking a denial; then, savagely decapi-
tating another prawn, he continued: “Ah,
many’s th’ cold watch I’ve kep’ on - ’er.
Four on, four off, week in, week out, f’r
years. Yesh. Decks awash, top-hamper
froze stiff, helmsman lashed t’ tli’ wheel, ’arf
th’ North Sea cornin’ aboard at every roll;
not th’ nice li’l* joggle y’ get in these lati-
toods, mind y’, but warrer, great, green
mountains o’ warrer!” He waved a prawn
above his head, to simulate vastness. “Once,
when all ratings was sick together, I ’ad t’ do
everything! Watch below, watch on deck, bit
o’ stokin’, bit o’ oilin’, even ’ad t’ tackle
th’ cookin'’! Yesh.” The fifteenth prawn
went to its long home as we came abreast
of the Heads. There was a stiff sou’-easter
blowing, and when we began to pitch a bit,
the man who had been a whole crew rose
unsteadily, and, leaving a trail of prawns
in. his wake, dived below. After a space his
friend also descended, and returned looking
slightly bewildered. “Where’s your mate?”
said I. “Oh, ’im,” replied the saturnine
gent. “ ’E’s up in th’ bows, sick as a dog!”

Good Value —
Always Growing Greater.
As the improvements are made in Dodge
Brothers car nothing is said to Dodge
Brothers dealers, or to'the public, about
them.
This is in pursuance of a policy inaugurated
by Dodge Brothers at the very outset.
They look upon the progressive improve-
ment of the car as a matter of course.
It is a plain duty they owe to themselves and
to the public.
There is no necessity of heralding these
improvements in advance.
The public finds out about them in due time,
and expresses appreciation and approval.
And so, while the process of betterment goes
on every day, nothing is said of it until
after it is accomplished.
The car is basically the same car as it was
five years ago.
Yet there isn’t a bit of doubt but that it is
a better car.
The car of to-day is worth more money than
the car of five years ago.
Not because the cost of materials have in-
creased—although they have —
But especially because the standards of con-
struction have been steadily raised —the
shop practice made steadily finer.
And still the buyers of the first cars, and
every subsequent car, received full value.
That is proven by the fact that all of the
cars, no matter how long ago they were
built, are giving good service to-day.
It is still further proven by the high price
they command when sold at second-
hand.
Any car built by Dodge Brothers commands
a high price—whether it was built five
years ago or five months ago.
This high valuation on any car bearing
Dodge Brothers’ name has been fixed, not
by them, but by the public.
Dodge Brothers have few market problems
to bother them, and practically nothing
to do but make the car better.
They are their own severest critics, and they
will never wait for the public to ask
for a better car from them.
They try to anticipate—to travel ahead —
to give even more than is expected.
No material, no part, and no accessory is
barred from Dodge Brothers car be-
cause it is too high priced.
The only question asked, the only proof de-
manded, is of its goodness.
When the car was designed, its parts were
charted and chosen according to quality
and with an utter disregard of price. 1
That policy still prevails, only it has been
intensified.
No source of supply can have too high a
standard for Dodge Brothers—-nothing
too good can be offered for Dodge Bro-
thers car.
There is not merely a pretence of building a
eood car; there ig an all-day and all-
night effort and determination to pro-
duce a good car.
That policy plus a process of research, test,
refinement and proof, make for continu-
ous progress.
That is why it is still the same car.
That is why its value is always growing
greater.
That is why the Standardised Motors
Limited, dealers in New South Wales
for Dodge Brothers find an ever-increas-
ing demand for the car.

Where are you
going to get those

Surprising though it may seem to the un-
initiated, the outside circumference of any
inflated 34in. x 4in. tube is 22 inches greater
than the inside circumference.
hgfh
NY inner tube when inflated is radically
longer in its outer circumference than
in its inner circumference, as is shown
by the illustration above.
Recognising this basic principle
Michelin Scientists have built
this difference into the Michelin
Tube by making it ring-shaped.
i
But every other tube is made perfectly straight
—its outer circumference being of practically
the same length as the inner circumference.
Since all tubes when in service must fill the inside of the cover, it is obvious that
straight tubes must be stretched on the outer circumference or compressed next to
the rim or both; whereas Michelin Tubes, being shaped to fit, are free from all
strains of tension or compression.

lars made by the Ross factories give splen-

corrected with one movement, whilst differ-

by adjustable eye-pieces.

Mclntosh’s new London Comedy'Co. has
given its first Australian performance at
Adelaide Tivoli. In “The Man from
Toronto” Douglas Murray has written a
light drawing-room comedy, wholesome,
occasionally witty, with hardly a serious
moment in it. A young widow learns that
a stranger has to marry her or forfeit a
fortune, and that he is coming to inspect
the property. From the moment she assumes
the cap and apron of her own maid to
receive him the end is never in doubt. No-
thing much turns on Toronto. It might
almost as well be Townsville. Its young
man is the English idea of the “colonial”
type, square-shouldered and reliable, but
given to drinking tea out of the saucer. If
he were Australian he wouldn’t say “Hell!”
so often.
* * * *
An accomplished company, mainly the
same as at the original production in Lon-
don, flashes through this light stuff. George
Tully has only to be the strong man with
petulant manners and frequent profanity.
Most of the work falls on Margaret Swal-
low (it was Iris Hoey in the London pro-
duction). She is a younger Marie Tempest,
a less reckless Daisy Jerome. Making every
look and gesture tell, she schemes her way
through the story brilliantiy till she is
admiringly detected, called a Little Devil
and taken to the arms of her destined Cana-
dian. Joseph Graham’s lawyer-uncle is
admirable character-acting. Ronald Ward
scores easily in the smart, sayings of a nice
boy, a kind of Pirie Bush anglicised. Marie
Rignold is a managing sister in the Emma
Temple manner, and Rosalind Courtneidge
(who is very young) looks the Colonial girl
of the author’s fancy, who can beat an
active young Englishman over a level half-
mile.
“The Little Damozel,” who has trans-
ferred her Trilbylike appearance from Adel-
aide to Melbourne King’s, is not related to
Rossetti’s Blessed Damosel who leaned out
from the gold bar of Heaven. The girl in
Monckton Ilofife’s fiction leans out from the
gold bar of the Cafe Angelique, and the harp
she plays is a mere worldly instrument.

Hon. Fitzroy Locke.
Julie Alardy, in
fact, is harpist in
the fortunate cafe
orchestra, a n d
when the unscru-
pulous comedy
opens she has fas-
cinated a wealthy,
wooden captain
who finances the
fairy cafe and
holds his promise
of marriage in a
bundle o f artless
letters. Having
recovered his rea-
son ( pro tem .) he
is very anxious to
marry somebody
else and get those
letters back, so he
agrees to pay
£15,000 to Reck-
law Poole, a popu-
lar punter, if he
will marry Julie
and induce her to
relinquish the cor-
respondence. Julie
likes Recklaw.
whereas she had
only thought of the
Captain as a con-
venient capitalist.
So the matrimonial scheme comes off. Ere the
joyous pair are many weeks wedded the
fact transpires—in an utterly improbable
and stagey manner—that the girl the Cap-
tain is about to marry is the same whom
Recklaw would have married seven years
earlier had he not been an irresponsible
rotter in impecunious circumstances. Then
Recklaw, with heartless and ridiculous can-
dor, blurts out the truth concerning his
matrimonial conspiracy, whereupon Julie is
pardonably angry with her husband, and
curses him for all he isn’t worth, and leaves
him so depressed that he spends the last
of his ready cash in insuring his life with
a view to suicide. These magnanimous sui-
cidal intentions being explained to Julie
(after she has returned, like the prodigal,
to the fatted calf at the Gafe Angelique). she
loves her husband more than ever. What
happens to the Captain and the other girl
is a secret that dies with the play.
Seriously considered, “The Little Darno-
zel” seems to this critic to be a droll ex-
ample of the shifts an unimaginative drama-
tist will resort to in the way of dramatic
expediency. Every situation in the
romance is as false as a political promise.
Probability hasn’t even a nodding acquaint-
ance with “The Little Damozel” ; neverthe-
less the play has pretensions to conven-
tional character-drawing, and is for the most
part a pleasing entertainment. The first
act is the brightest; the third, which reeks
of evidence of a happy ending to come, is
the dullest. In the middle act the puerili-
ties of the plot-making are glaringly con-
spicuous, but here is the opportunity for
Emelie Polini to get mad with Kay Sou per,
and she does it convincingly. The weak-
ness of the cause is forgotten in the force
of the effect. Miss Polini is a mistress of
emotional acting. She may lack the fullest
intensity of passion, but the ring of truth
is in her beautiful voice-inflections and the
charm of naturalness is in her quietly dis-
tinctive personality. She makes a rather
spiteful young cat of a character seem almost

winsome. Kay
Souper fills the bill
at the outset, but
is crushed by his
burden of obvious
artificiality later
on. Cecil Brook-
ing’s mannerisms of
diction in a harm-
less Gussie capacity
give him the air of
possessing a person-
ality. Victor Fitz-
herbert is a wood-
enish representa-
tive of the wealthy
Captain, yet he
might be much
more flexible with-
out having any pre-
tensions to natural-
ise the stagey situa-
tions of the second
act. Miss Ney
plays the small
part of a kind of

and other people
are concerned in
depicting the joys
and comforts of bohemian life at the

The Adelaide Repertory people have given
the first Australian production of Eden
Pliillpotts’s “St. George and the Dragon”
at the local King’s. It is funny and very
English. Two patrician sisters have let
themselves become engaged to a Scotch
curate and a yeoman farmer. Their bishop-
uncle is sooled on to this tragedy and thence-
forward holds the centre of the stage. In
fact, this is the kind of play written by
crafty authors to attract middle-aged actor-
managers, and the young people ip love are
merely a kind of comic relief. The curate
is dead easy, falling at once to the pro-
mise of a fat chaplaincy open only to a
celibate. The farmer is not to be bluffed;
so the girl is induced to spend an evening
in the bosom of his family, where the bishop
leads all hands on to eat and drink a little
too much, to smoke and sing and dance.
The youth even plays a concertina, and that,
of course, is unspeakable. So there is a
clean break-away; and both parties are
easily consoled by “someone in their own
class.” But the two girls, who are no fools,
give their uncle at curtain-fall such a
tongue-lashing as no bishop ever received on
the stage before.
The Rep. acting was good, though not
up to the standard of some previous occa-
sions. In particular, make-up was too obvi-
ous among the men. James Anderson gave
a polished but merry performance of the
bishop, whether in diplomacy or (slightly)
in liquor. The parents were in safe hands,
Nave and Miss Stacey, Harford and Miss
Craigie; and George McLeay realised the
bounder-hero. Excellent small-part players
w’ere Claude Saunders as the Scotchman,
Jack Harvey, as a rustic and Gwen Hone
as a country cousin.

Scenery, frocks and legs are the most
memorable features of “The Bing Boys on
Broadway,” which appeared at Melbourne
Majesty’s on Saturday night. The music
has no conspicuous charm, but occasionally
forgets its place with a blare'of brass and a
crash of cymbals. The comedy is neat in
spots, but it depends for its effect on the
quality of the principals. Of these the
two most important are Jennie Hartley and
Phil Smith. Jennie, as the Dowager
Duchess of Dullwater, whose diamond garter
is the objective of three mournful crooks,
is an eccentric symposium of masculine
humor, with more gesture than seems neces-
sary for the job in hand. She sings her
opening number,
“H ell o, New
York,” in a fairly
brisk style, but
her voice was
never intended for
heavy labor in a
revue. Smith has
a cheerful moment
with an imaginary
banjo in the sixth
scene, but he is
nowhere very
diverting. Dan
Agar is cast on
the programme in
Smith’s previous
part of Shorty,
but Daniel wa s
absent o n Satur-
day, and Reginald
Roberts took his
place. Reg dis-
closed a stony face
gripping a cigar,
but beyond an
occasional c o la-
ment he is no
more to the story
than the two other
diamond-snatchers,
Frank Greene
and Gwen Bur-
roughs. Greene
sings “In Manda-
lay” at the end,
but this is his only
escape from the

Beauty ,” at Sydney

routine of pursuing diamonds in opium-
joints, roof-gardens and other places. The
opium scene, commencing with an incon-
gruous swirl of purple and lavender dancers,
is the only departure from the triviality
prevailing elsewhere. Gus Bluett, as Roti-
fer Bing, accompanies cousin Lucifer on
his mild adventures. Hettie Hartley’s com-
modious figure surges in low-comedy trap-
pings in the roof-garden scene, where also
Leslie Victor loses himself under the blue
thatch of a burlesque French tenor. Her-
bert Walton, as a confidence man, waiter,
and other personages, remains the same
Herbert, despite all the efforts of his
greasepaint and tailor to give him a
reputation for versatility. Myrtle Power
and Thelma Carter are two attrac-
(ive damsels with noticeable voices, and
Phyllis Amery is a spark in pale daffo-
dil in her cabaret dance with Mel Ward.
The best scenes are the roof-garden with
the skyscrapered background and the Green-
wich Village. The shapely and well-trained
chorus is the scene-painter’s accomplice in
the most decorative efforts, and scores hap-
pily as the Red Indian populace in the
frivolity of Scene 5.
Dolores, returning to Melbourne Town
Hall last Saturday night, had only one or
two of her long-familiar numbers on the
programme, but several of the others came
along as encores. From a repertory that
includes every sort of admirable song An-
tonia Dolores selected some of her recent
additions, and in everything her art was
charming. She will not be heard again in
Melbourne until June 3 and 5, and then, it

The placid little lady will return to the
Europe which has changed so much for the
worse since last she saw it, and Melbourne
may know the magic of her smile no more.
The amazing Carter is still practising the
Black Art at Sydney Criterion in collabora-
tion with a lion who, as no student of ani-
mals fails to remark in due course, never
scratches himself. The phenomenon is due
to a piece of wizardry, in the palming line,
which the magician has been offered thou-
sands to reveal —chiefly by dog-owners. It
is known as “The Disappearing Flea Trick,”
and is mostly practised before select audi-
ences off-stage.

The sensational bit of Saturday night’s
Moiseiwitsch concert at Sydney Town Hall
was the Liszt transcription of the “Tann-
hauser” overture. Moiseiwitsch made the
one lonely concert-grand sound like a rein-
forced Verbrugghen orchestra. The young-
man, whose fingers bound from the key-
board with the exuberance of a clenched
fist from a punching-ball, was perfectly at
home in the big work, and did nothing to
the prejudice of either composer; and he
responded to the dinkum-Aussie encore by
returning to prove there is yet balm in Gilead
by pouring Chopin’s waltz in C sharp minor
into the souls of 3000 listeners.
“The Sleeping Beauty” wakes and packs
on Friday, and “Kissing Time” punches the
Bundy clock and begins work at Sydney
Majesty’s on Saturday night.

“Mother Hubbard” keeps up a pretence
of poverty at Sydney Palace, to which
theatre all children under 00 are still hurry-
ing. Mother is so rich now that if she
existed outside the theatre. she would be
a Dame of the British Empire.
Sydney Tivoli will open “Bran Pie' on
Saturday. Lee White is the leading feminine
star; and playgoers are glad to see the
name of Victor Gouriet billed again.
The J.C.W. Digger-Pierrots are holding
out at Sydney Royal. They are now offer-
ing a third change of programme.
“The Rat” timidly poked out its nose
three times at Sydney Playhouse this week,
the University Dramatic Society doing the
shoving and succeeding about as well as
intelligent amateurs ever do. Author
Frederick Ward produced his own play,
which has a political setting and a hero
who “rats” on his party —hence the title.
Ward is an actor and playwright of long
experience marooned in a country which
imports its plays as it imports its silk hose
and motor-cars, and this amateur produc-
tion represents an attempt to let a play see
the light in the country of its birth.
“The Broken Meiody,” which poor old'
Van Biene's ’cello turned into a popular
success, is living in dumb show at Sydney
Strand and the Empress, with Eugene
O’Brien as the simple lover with the color
tubes who leaves his little lady to cultivate
her voice amid the bobbed heads and the
spaghetti suppers of Greenwich ATllage. But
though success dogs their steps the old love
is ever the true love, so it’s reunion in the
little old stoodio in the Village for the final
cuddle-up. Tom Moore, as the composer
who spends his life writing an inspired
opera called “Heartsease,” just escapes get-
ting done-in for both his girl (the daughter
of a belted earl) and his manuscript by
a rival named Pomfret. However, memory
returning, he claims the authorship of the
songandance souffle, and wins the girl, royal-
ties and dad’s consent at one fell swoop.
Lyceum and Lyric tell the story.
“Going Up,” the comedy with music in
it that ran formerly at Melbourne Majesty’s,
is to give the New Comics a show at Mel-
bourne Royal, starting on Friday this week.
To-night (Thursday) is the last of “Tilly
of Bloomsbury,” which frankly Cockney
comedy of manners has flourished, in spite of
its extravagance, for two or three months.
The Smart Set Diggers at Melbourne
Playhouse are now doing a neat little bur-
lesque of “The Country Girl,” wherein
Bobbie Roberts fusses effectively as Mar-
jorie, and Jock Thompson is a mirthful
Rajah of Bhong. The skit on “Camille,’*
however, remains the Smart Setters’ best
joke. Whitlow, as the sugared Almond of
the piece, is just like George Cross with an
additional barrel of treacle, while Charles
Holt’s diverting picture of Camille dese-
crates the memories of Eugenie Duggan,
Tilda Brune and other ladies who have suf-
fered in the role. Whitlow and Holt are
both good, but Holt’s work is the funnier
because he never descends to clowning. The
affected seriousness of his acting is the
cleverest part of his caricature.

The change of Dads in “On Our Selec-
tion” at Melbourne Princess’s has made life
a bit easier for Billy Bearup, who can now
get closer to his faithful Sarah without in-
curring great risk from Ned Duggan’s boot.
Edmund is a slower mover than the pre-
vious Dad, Bert Bailey, whose great wind
and speed kept Billy slinking forlornly on
the sky-line for most of the play.
At Melbourne Tivoli Rex London is still
demonstrating that 11 widows are well lost
for a life of happiness with Vera Pearce.
Gladys Brockwell is convincing Hoyt’s
Melbourne supporters that a passion for
decency and home comforts can be dis-
covered in the most twisted natures. This
gratifying intelligence is conveyed in
Gladys’s latest vehicle, “Thieves,” lately
received from the Fox studio. Another Fox
subject, “Vagabond Luck,” is also at Hoyt’s
and shows how a prehistoric neddy and an
ancient jock can coptrive to make Isaac
YfcShortodds look foolish. There are also
unexpected results and some bright flashes
of humor in Hoyt’s third subject, “Widow
by Proxy,” with Marguerite Clark in front.
At the Melba “Sealed Hearts” pictures the
tragedy of a lad who falls in love with his
youthful stepmother. This interesting dis-
play of affection is given by Eugene O’Brien
supported by Lucille Lee Stuart. The
Britannia’s principal claim to notice this
week is Sessue Hayakawa in his Jap-uneasy
pose as “The Dragon Painter.”
First-class concerts are overdone in Adel-
aide at the moment. The Conservatorium
is worthy a long notice; also Miss Rene
Maxwell’s soprano has filled the Town Hall,
Una Black fiddling and Sellars singing in
support. And Edward Goll brought his
piano into a Brewster Jones orchestral per-
formance, where Stanford’s Irish symphony
was the most striking and unusual item of
a brilliant evening.

In her Melbourne action against Sydney
Yates for breach of promise Daisy Yates
was fairly entitled to her verdict for £5OO
damages and costs. On the evidence she
had shared with the male dancer the best
years of her life and a large part of her
earnings; and the fact also that his pros-
pective marriage with Maggie Dickinsom
would improve his chances with the Firm
was no doubt considered by the jury. In
the absence of direct proof of the promise
of marriage, the jury had to come to a
decision on the evidence of character. Daisy
showed up well as the wronged woman of
melodrama, and when she dragged in her
che-ild by a former marriage, Syd and his
counsel hadn’t anything to combat the
vision of her fascinating wretchedness.

lot of excellent
players of the ordi-
nary stage make
very poor actors
when facing the
camera, and many
of the best of the
picture pros, have
been quite indif-
ferent stage
players in their
time. Mary Pick-
ford was on the
stage from child-
hood, yet made no
impression there,
whereas on the
screen she has cap-
tured creation, not
by cheap and easy
effort, but by the
display of unex-
ampled excellence
in the portrayal of
certain types, an
excellence which
not even our
greatest female
comedians in the
articulate play
could hope to
attain on the
screen. True, a
certain kind of
film-work can be
done by the mere
tyro who will
stand up to the
camera with rea-
sona b 1 e impu-
dence, and who is a
good-looker; but consider how much of our
stage space is filled with performers equally
meritorious before condemning the movies
as something extra-special in awfulness.
Joseph Graham, veteran comedian in
Courtneidge’s London Comedy Co., visited
Australia 40 years ago in support of “Fritz”
Emmet and Mrs. Scott Siddons. At that
time Maggie Moore was the rage in “Struck
Oil,” and it is a coincidence that after two
score years Joseph and Maggie should be
playing in Adelaide again at the same time.
“Scotia” : The Aussie tradition still holds
in Britain. Here in Aberdeen, where Scots
are hard as the granite of the streets, I
saw Ned Lupino at the Tivoli, one of the
variety houses of the town, impersonate the
hard-case Digger. And though audiences
here are conspicuous for their dourness, the
sketch won roars of laughter and rounds of
applause. At least the sketch won the
laughter and the Digger won the applause.
“1.L.C.” : When we take into consideration
that his orchestra is a medley of male and
female semi-amateurs, the women having
neither the strength nor breadth of bowing of
their brother-fiddlers, the little Belgian may
claim to have achieved something not far
short of a triumph. Symphony orchestras in
Europe are chiefly peopled by artists of first-
class individual merit, so that comparisons
would not be justified. To expect a perfect per-
formance from the material under his baton
would be asking the impossible, but a little
more attention could be paid to the polish
of the ensemble, and the brass instrumental-
ists require chastisement. The interpreta-
tion of Beethoven lays itself open particu-
larly to criticism. The master-classic was,
with a very few exceptions, heavy, deep,
mysterious, majestic. Verbrugghen’s light
and airy treatment supplies the atmosphere
of Mozart rather than of Beethoven. That he
gives the crowd of music-lovers for whom he
caters a pleasant and easily-understood ver-
sion of classical music is acknowledged, but
the thrill and ecstasy the student and the
true musician crave for are sadly missing.
Whilst trying to make the classics enjoyable
to the mob, he should take care not to make
Beethoven quite so subservient to Verbrug-
ghen.
“0.K.”: Try a slice of nonsense from an
Argus glorification of Verbrugghen:—
The concert opened with the Bth Symphony. Mr.
Verbnigghen made some great points in the first and
fourth movements, wherein the composer, in his
most “unbuttoned” humor (the term is his own),
cracks all sorts of jokes. No one can say exactly
what they are—whether he is putting into the music
his exploit with his cook, whom he pelted with
the eggs she gave him because they were not fresh,
or his rather rough horseplay with some of his
friends. No one cares, in fact. The music literally
bubbles with merriment, and is aesthetically and
emotionally delightful to listen to, especially when
a Verbrugghen does it.
Some further remarks concerning the magi-
cal effect on the orchestra of the conductor’s
left arm, which was only exceeded in marvel-
lousness by the movements of his right arm,
but which might have been surpassed in
witchery by a third arm had the maestro
possessed such a thing, may be left to stew in
their own treacle. Enough to drink in the
critic’s enjoyment of the Verbrugghen inter-
pretation of the humor of Beethoven. He
didn’t grasp the exact meaning of Beet.’s
jokes (he was an honest critic in not pretend-
ing to know what the wild waves were say-
ing), but he could swear to the delightfulncss
of it all. If Beet, was chucking rotten eggs
at the cook, the odor of decayed hen-fruit
diffused by the orchestra was sweeter than
frankincense. If the bubbling strains of
merriment signified that Beet, was pushing
a pal into the slop-pail, or strewing banana
skins in the path of his poor old aunt, it
was aesthetically and emotionally delightful.
No matter what sort of joke was being per-
petrated the critic thought it the fun of the
world—-especially when a Verbrugghen did
it. But he is distressingly vague on one
point. Touching the eggs Beet, pelted his
cook with, did she purposely give them to
him “because they were not fresh”?
Australian manufacture gets a good ad. in
a piano on view at the Peace Exhibition in
Adelaide. It went on board the Medic as
soon as the war started, and has seen hard
service ever since in Egypt, France, Eng-
land, and round the world. Neither heat
nor cold has affected it. It got an unkind
bump at Port Adelaide lately, but its in-
nards are as sound and tuneful as ever.
“Kodak”: Melba is coming. You can
always tell. Months before she is due we
start to catch it in the eye. The Dame can’t
get enough food at a reasonable price in
London, and is bursting to be back at
Coombe Cottage where the cows deliver the
goods twice a day and the hens never cease
from laying. This despatch is written tear-
fully as if she were a queen languishing in
exile and trying to keep body and soul to-
gether in cheap lodgings. The fact is, how-
ever, mentioned that she was a guest at a
small dinner-party which cost the host £75.
This bubbly item is intended to draw sobs
from people who are content to live on a
steak-and-onion basis. But that is only
the first shot of the bombardment. Presently
we’ll have something sobby every morning
about Melba’s eagerness to get home and
shake hands with the national debt. And
finally there will be a whirling arrival with
sugary interviews, bouquets, fountains of
afternoon tea, “Home, Sweet Home,” tears,
sniffs and Conservatorium girls fainting all
over the place and obstructing the traffic.
A great artist is Melba. She would have
made a million in any advertising business.
“T. 0.1.” on Henry Irving’s tutor: —
It was at a time when Hoskins was lessee of both
Melbourne Rojal and Princess’s, the latter the old
wooden box in Spring-street. We were to have an
amateur dramatic performance at the old Princess’s,
and the lessee was to share the house with us. Our
strong man was Jack Edwards, solicitor, M.L.A., and
known as “the Collingwood Chicken.” He was a
good amateur comedian, and was cast for Ollapod
in “The Poor Gentleman.” I was Sir Robert Bramble.
A couple of nights before our date Edwards fell ill.
He sent for me. I found him in bed, his doctor
beside him, and a bottle of Hennessy close by. The
doctor said it was impossible that the patient
could appear. Here was a fix! Ten o’clock on the
morning of performance and the principal actor in
bed 1 I was deputed to see Hoskins and ask him to
play Ollapod, in which he was famous, Edwards
undertaking to play for his benefit when required. I
waited upon the big man in his little white-washed
room at the old Royal. I gave my message, and
there was an explosion 1 But to save the situation he
would play. At night the old house was crowded.
My next difficulty was to apologise for Edwards.
The late Dr. J. E. Nield happened to be on the
stage. I placed the duty on his shoulders. When
he announced the substitute groans changed to
cheers. I was standing with Hoskins in the wings,
he dressed for his part, when the cheer went up.
How he preened himself and how he played that
night! Hoskins was a great actor ; he has not been
equalled in Australia as Ollapod, Dr. Pangloss or
Mercutio.
“Local Talent”: It would appear that
Moses Baritz (B. 13/5/’2O) has not heard
Gladys Verona, the Sydney girl who took
Gertrude Johnston’s place in the Williamson
Grand Opera Co. on its return from Maori-
land, and is considered by manager Rigo and
others of the co. by far the better singer
of the two. In Brisbane she made the hit
of the season. But, like many others, to
obtain full recognition she will have to leave
her homeland, as she is under the disadvant-
age of not having a “big” voice. In America

or England this does not matter, if the voice
carries well. Galli-Curci, greatest coloratura
of to-day, has an organ more conspicuous for
purity than strength, and her success has
been mainly due to the exquisite delicacy
and airy lightness of her singing.
“Dido”: “His Little Widows” is a rare
collection of ancient jests and Babylonian
wheezes. Listening to it one is impelled to
exclaim with Mark Twain: “Who opened
that sarcophagus!” However, “His Little
Widows” has one new joke. The comedian
makes a noise in his neck, and the other
'comedian says: “What is that?” Whereat
the first comedian ups and answers: “That
is a banana back-firing!” And everybody
is delighted. It is so successful I wonder
the comedy is not filled up with similar
mechanical wheezes. The stage-carpenter or
the property-man could make them in great
profusion, and however hurt the civilised
spectator might be at the insult to his intel-
ligence, he would at least be spared the
necessity of pretending to be tickled on
hearing the jokes Adam told Eve when the
leaves began to turn.
“T. D. Emdee”: Allen Doone is the son of
a Sydney bank manager. But papa does
not exactly approve of the profession, which
does not furnish the best avenue for money-
making. Doone was originally selected as
leading man for Sara Allgood, but the en-
gagement missed fire.
“0.P.”: J. Hartley Manners, husband of
Laurette Taylor, the original Peg in “Peg
o’ My Heart,” was in Australia with
Charles Cartwright and his daughter Edith
Morley during the former’s second visit to
this country. Cartwright did not long have
the support of his daughter, who was rather
badly injured while riding in the Centennial
Park, Sydney. Manners was not a bad actor,
but, like Pinero, found that there is more
money in writing plays than in acting them
“Ant”: We were in the stalls, and on the
stage a lady was singing a truly awful song

“Old Pot” : Jennie Pollock, one-time lead-
ing lady with Bland Ilolt, who retired from
the profession after her marriage with Ross
Simpson, has been left a widow, her hus-
band having gone west on May 17. Her
last public performance was at the benefit
to bonnie Harrie Ireland. Ross Simpson
was the organiser.
“E.T.”: Australia’s old theatrical friend
Hugh Buckler is giving the London. public
some very admirable performances, and, inci-
dentally, showing more versatility than he
displayed here. Last month he was Captain
Jack Smith, R.H.F., in a musical piece by
the author of “Morocco Bound,” at the
Scala. It is called “Society Limited.”
“Buck” not only gets heaps of praise for his
acting, but his singing is also commended.
“ Jeune Premier”: ■ The old gibe that
“theatricals don’t pay” is always sure of a
laugh. I notice the gag has cropped up
again in the Adelaide Licensing Court (B.
6/5/’2O). On investigation we shall find
that the mummer not only pays, but is abso-
lutely ridiculously generous in his disburse-
ments. When he secures an engagement,
no matter how long his previous “vacation”
may have been, he rehearses for nothing,
making a present of the salary that should
be his to his bosses. He gets a weekly
screw, but cheerfully throws in two matinee
performances free. When he travels from
Sydney to Melbourne, or vice versa, his
sleeping accommodation costs him 15s. If
he is going beyond those centres to Adelaide
or Brisbane (as frequently occurs) the
amount is 30s. On the journey he pays
through the nose for his vittles, and is not
paid for the night or two nights lost on the
trip. And for his hotel or boarding-house
he parts up, I dare be sworn, more regularly
than many in far better circumstances. And
if a pub is his lodging the proprietor gener»
ally sees to it that his bar-bill is not the
least of his extras. Added to all this he
may have a home to keep going in a town
that he never sees during the whole run of
his engagement. Bah ! I’m sick of the
hoary-headed catch-phrase. If theatricals
don’t pay, I should like to know who do!
Sara Allgood has not lost much time in
getting work in England. She is to make
her re-appearance in London this month
(May) in a new play by Lennox Robinson,
the Irish playwright, author of the widely-
known “Lost Leader.” It is called “The
White-headed Boy.” That most successful
of brainy managers, J. Bernard Fagan, has
the production in hand.
Emmett Adams, the Australian composer
of “God Send You Back to Me” and “Bells
of Saint Mary’s,” is to arrive in Sydney,
after eight years’ absence, by the Makura
on Saturday.
In an Adelaide court a “theatrical la-
borer,” suing for wages, told how he was
engaged on the side-shows at the Peace Ex-
hibition. “I was working for ‘Crazy Cot-
tage,’ ” he explained, “also for ‘Over the Top’
and ‘Niagara’: but most of the time I was
spruiking for ‘Hell.’ ”
THE OVERGROWTH OF DATSY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Miss Daisy Vesta was the star,
The fairest fay and ’cutest yet;
Her reputation galloped far.
And then successes she had met
Began to tell on Daisy’s shape.
The singer fattened visibly,
And longer grew the circling tape.
It seemed that there was no escape
From fearful adiposity.
Upon the people she had grown
At twenty, now at thirty she
Had by well over seven stone
Outgrown her popularity.
She had been smart and rather sweet,
And now had every cause to sulk.
Good spirits won’t avert defeat:
The people like their spirits neat,
And never, it would seem, in bulk.
I saw her serving drinks to rakes,
A heavy barmaid, hot and cross.
So Fortune whimsically makes
Our greatest gain our greatest loss.
I cite her case for queens of song,
By whom good feeding should be shunned.
Oh, bear in mind, ye tuneful throng,
The stern decree that art is long,
Nor seek to make it so rotund !

"ON TOP" WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
The way in which the profession of un-
registered bookmaking is leaping ahead in the big
cities —more particularly Melbourne and Sydney—
is astonishing people who have watched this form
of gambling for quarter of a century. It started
in the West End of London long before the great
legal argument began as to the meaning of “a
place”; and it was then generally accepted as
being within the law. Here it is fragrantly illegal,
and everyone knows it; and yet on any race day,
however paltry the meeting may be, scores of people
assemble at the different big “shops” and plunge
to the limit of their cash or credit. Latterly women
have been figuring increasingly at these places, their
wagering being even gamer than that of the men.
One explanation of the development is the vast
amount of paper money which is flying round ; and
that indeed may be the entire solution. Those
whose business it is to wipe out such resorts might
explain why. But they won’t.

Goodwood Handicap-winner, Trillion —
one of the Clarke-bred Trey, Three, Thrice series—-
though fat as an alderman, was too good for half
a dozen others over six furlongs at Rosehill on
Saturday. Bidden by Myles Connell and carrying
Bst. 61b., the black started at 10’s and did Ike
a good turn. There will be a couple of well-gilded
sprints at ltandwick next month; and as some of
Sydney’s speediest nags obviously need a spell,
while Trillion ought to be in better nick than he
was on Saturday—well, what do you think ?
* * * *
Biplane, the champion of a couple of
years ago, started at Rosehill on Saturday, but
left the problem of whether or no he can ever
come back shrouded in mystery. He was fifth in
a field of eight.
* * # *
The suspicion that Sydney Cup-winner,
lan ’Or, has a good race in him yet seemed justi-
fied at the finish of Rosehill Flying Welter. As
it was only over seven furlongs he was reckoned
right out of his distance, and went off at 100’s to
3. Yet he was only a head away at the end, and
this in a fairly smart fitdd.
Saturday’s racing in Melbourne threw no
light on the coming jumping carnival, for the steeple-
chasers that Yarram Lea beat over the Moonee
Valley course were nowhere near National class.
Neither is Captain W., who won the hurdle race,
nearly as clean a juniper as he one time promised
to be. One of the several nags that fell in this
same hurdle race bore the ominous name of Stum-
bler, and his rider, J. O’Reilly, was still uncon-
scious when removed to the hospital and subse-
quently died. These jockeys who take more than
flat-race risks deserve more than the fees they get.
* * * *
Airman Rod McGinness, D.F.C., of Fram-
iingham (Vic.), who was to have taken part in the
England-to-Australia flight in which Ross Smith
afterwards led the way, was negotiating with the
late Sam McCaughey about the matter when the
interested sheepocrat turned his attention to other
things forever. This upset McGinness’s plans, but
he consoled himself the other day by doing a popular
stunt at the Warrnambool races. It was his first
appearance as an amateur rider since the war, and
he pushed his prad first past the post in the hurdles,
amid the frenzied enthusiasm of the spectators.
The first day of the Adelaide Cup meeting
was fine, the last two wet; so there was a falling-off
in attendance and totalisator takings. In all £60,000
went through the machine, the State Government
taking £3OOO out of it, and the S.A. Jockey Club
£4500 towards the £6300 stake-money. Local
owners Gregory and Hawker won Cup and Goodwood,
but E. E. D. Clarke (Vic.) carried home a lot of
stake-money, winning the Leger with Hyades, and
two youngsters’ races with Refraction. The local
Hesso was the best two-year-old seen, and King of
the Sea took the only w.f.a. event. Lewis was the
only rider with three wins. Wee Gun’s Cup win
brings his total of stakes won up to £6750. Un-
fortunately for himself and his owner, he cajj never
produce his home form when tried in the other
States where stakes are higher.
* * * *
Entrants for the G. N. Hurdle Race were
expected to include King Neptune after that promis-
ing novice had won over the sticks at his first
attempt in public; but the half-brother to Green-
stead was not on the list when it appeared. On
the other hand, novices like Blue Cross, Telecles,
Court Jester, Red Signal, Belgium Waif and Two
Blues are among the entries. One of these years a
raw beginner at the game may win a National —
i.e., a first-season jumper may prove fully equal
to the strain of a three-mile journey with sticks in
the way. Malua, a Melbourne ,Cup and Newmarket
winner, did the trick on the strength of his being
a natural jumper who cleared hurdles with little
effort. Nationals, however, want a lot more win-
ning than they did in Malua’s time day. The time
is half a minute faster.
* * * *
A visitor at Morphettville on Adelaide
Cup day was Dick Wootton, just back from England.
His jockey sons Stanley and Frank having returned
safely from the war, he made them a present of his
Epsom training establishment, Treadwell House, and
the big business he had worked up, and has come
back to N. S. Wales to end his days. He has
brought a few good youngsters, mostly of his own
breeding, and they will be racing in his colors
shortly.
* * * *
At the Wanganui (M.L.) May Meeting
the speedy Lord Nagar (which, when owned by the
Rajah of Pudakota, made the Randwick record
of 3min. 40:|sec. for two miles over hurdles) had
not much difficulty, carrying a pound less and
having a quarter of a mile cut off the journey, in
taking the Hurdle in 3min. 29 4-ssec. Oil the same
day Old Mungindi ran into third place in the
Steeple. Lord Nagar who, with Old Mungindi, is
owned by W. It. Kemball. is to start in the Great
Northern Hurdles, and the last-named and Gladful
in the G. N. Steeple.

Some Boy (Cyrus—The Tart) —or Sonus
Boy 11., as he is known in the Riekefty Isles—
is understood to have ended his racing career. He
was bought in Australia by one of the wealthy
Allisons at last yearling sales.
T. 11. Lowry has decided to mate Desert
Gold with' Finland, tire sire of Estland, Finmark
etc. The son of Bill of Portland was foaled in

Twenty thousand Sydney League enthusi-
asts rolled up on Saturday to see Easts wallop Glebe’s
“Dirty Reds.” The vvatersiders outplayed the
enemy in every department. Easts’ forwards were
ike terriers, and the deeds of the ancient Sandv
Pearce, Daisy Williams, Bluey Watkins and Chilla
Lees were so many object-lessons to the Glebe
brigade. Easts’ backs were given a good share of
the ball by Pearce, and they made the best use
of the opportunities offered, tackling, passing and
kicking beautifully. The bright particular star
of the day was Wally Messenger, though he only
burst into Easts team at the last moment, vice
George Challis, full-back, who had decided not to
play. Rex Norman replaced the absentee, and
Messenger came in as winger. Ilis try in the western
corner was a magnificent effort; so was one of his
goals, from 10 yards outside half-way. R ex Nor-
man s exhibition at full-back should give him a bio-
chance of rep. honors. Another likely rep. is Caples
whose straight running, solid tackling and heady
Play at stand-oft half were perfection. The Burge
brothers did not shine
for Glebe as they
might have done with
less attention from
Bluey Watkins and co.
Tibby Benson at half-
back proved a better
man than Solomon
Hangman, his Eastern
rival. Norman Proc-
tor, Glebe’s stand-off
half and scorer of
their only try, was
the pick of the Red
bunch. In the other
matches Wests beat
Norths by 24 to 10;
Balmain ate up Uni.
(60 points to 13) ;
whilst Souths leathered
Newtown to the tune
of 33 to 5. Annan-
dale scored their first
competition points—
they had the bye.
VICTOR
BELCHER, of
South Melbourne.
He lean captain of
Vic. in the last
inler-State match,
Vic. and South
Aus. Ha joined
South Melbourne
team in 1907, and
has been dip tain
and rice-captain
several times.
It is up to the League authorities to
think of a remedy for a situation which is plainly
absurd. Uni. and Annandale are certainly not
classy enough for first-grade honors. Either
their total elimination or a further splitting-up
of districts, accompanied by liberal permits to sur-
plus first-graders in the strong clubs to. shift to
other clubs, appears the likeliest solution.
* * * *
The Northern Union (English) football
army arrived in Sydney on Monday. They are a
thick-set lot, but in playing poundage they will
be on the light side compared with the local men.
Three of the forwards draw a heavy beam- —Bowers
(15st. 61b.), Clark (14st. 41b.) and Ben Gronow
(14st.). Gronow is a champion goal-kicker: last
year he found the uprights 147 times. Harold
Wagstaffe, of Huddersfield, who leads the XIII, is
than when hp toured in Australia with the
1914 XIII; but his form in England last vear was
great. The tour opens at Sydney on June 5.
The Englishmen are resolute in standing by the
Northern Union rule which forbids the replacement
of injured players. As a matter of fact, they have
no option in the matter, since they come here with
explicit orders on the point from their Council.
It seems a damphoolish arrangement to the Austra-
lian mind —if nothing worse. Some of its possi-
bilities are to put a premium on disabling play;
to hopelessly handicap a side which has bad luck
with its good men in the earlier stages; and to
keep casualties on the field who, for the sake of
their health, should be off it and in charge of a
doctor.
The Soccer football season in England
was a triumph for the Midland clubs which had gone
completely into recess during the war. Aston Villa
won the English Cup, the great competition for
which every club in the country enters, and in which
a single defeat means Out. The head of the League,
which is confined to the best professional clubs, and
in which every game played during the season
counts, wag taken by West
Bromwich Albion easily,
with Burnley second. At
the bottom of the League
list were Notts County and
Sheffield Wednesday; and
these, under the inexorable
law which makes for the
survival of the fittest, will
next winter be in the
second league, their places
in the first being taken by
Tottenham Hotspur (Lon-
don) and Huddersfield,
which were at the head of
the second. This same
Huddersfield, almost uii-
knowm before this season,
also got into the much
coveted Cup final. The
south of England has a
less important League of
its own; Portsmouth and
Watford tied for the hend
of this.
M. E. GREEN,

Football Club.
The fourth round of Sydney Rugby Union
football found Glebe-Balmain pitted against Mos-
nian, against whom they registered 14 points in
each half to a try. Mayne was several times
“counted out" for alleged roughness by the Mosman
barrackers. Buchanan was in fine converting form,
and he had a strenuous time behind the pack.
Pountney and Alder were the pick of the quarters.
Buckle, the Mosman full-back, although light, has
plenty of grit, and he with D. Hodgins and Black-
wood showed most resistance to the onslaught. New-
town and Norths were well matched, although the
latter won by 16-3. The Shoremen have two players
above the average in Cooney and Humphries. Judd,
of Newtown, plays an almost lone hand at present,
but his side is improving, and the forwards are
the makings of a fine pack. ’Varsity began by out-
pointing Manly by fast forward play: and in the
second half the Village ’quarters could not pace it
with the scholars’ back division. Mingay stood
out from his comrades, and James and Thorn battled
gamely. Scores, 27-9. Easts outlasted Wests, and
won a fast game by S points. Mcßorie repeatedly
got his backs going, but the defence was fairly
strong. Walker (behind the scrum), Elook and
Bedford were always in evidence. Wogan, for Wests,
did excellent service with his deadly tackle, and
Westropp tried hard. Wests’ handicap was their
kicking.
In Sydney under Australian rules, New-
town (16 points) is having a runaway gallop. Easts
and Paddington (each eight points) are next. New-
town-Easts match saw the latter defeated by 52-26.
Piper kicked three goals for Newtown, and Jenkins
notched two of the three acquired by Easts.
Slonpy grounds and a greasy ball spoilt
Melbourne’s football on Saturday in a sense, though
the various issues were close. Wood went across
to ’Roy’s ground and found its neighbors an im-
proved proposition, especially in passing the ball
to the man best placed to kick a goal. Wherefore
the Magpies were 8 points in default when the
bell rang—s 3 to ’Roy’s 61. The massive men of
Carlton spiflieated the smaller and lighter Essen-
don 18 by 101 points to 55. Yet ’Don is hereby
adjured to, keep its tail up. On a hard, dry ground,
with practice and system, it should run around the
weighty Old Blues. Richmond visited Geelong and
returned with its symmetrical sequence of victories
still unbroken —73 to 64. But the seasiders’ kick-
ing was great—lo goals 4 behinds. Genteel St.
Kilda visited the Melbourne ground, and lost most
of its temper on finding a different combination
there from the one it had easily doubled up last
season. Several hefty scraps occurred. Naturally
Melbourne won. They amassed 81 points to Saints’
41.
* * * *
A huge crowd of Vic. Football Ass. fol-
lowers pushed itself into the Footseray ground to
view the collision of last season’s premiers and
runners-up—’Scray and North—and a tremendous
and willing scuffle ensued. Never more than a goal
separated the teams; and there was only a two-
points difference when the end came. Scores were:
44 to 42. This leaves ’Scray the only unbeaten Ass.
team.
* * * *
The place of the late E. T. Smith as
president of the S.A. Cricket Assoc, is to be filled
by lawyer Mostyn Evan. He was practically the
only possible candidate in sight, having, as chair-
mon, done nearly all the work for years past. Evan
has the distinction of having been a member of
every council or board of control that has existed
to manage Australian cricket, and is therefore well
known in other capitals. He lately resigned the
presidency of S.A. Lacrosse Assoc., which he had
held over 20 years. His successor is Harry Hod-
getts, who had been chairman; and that post is
now filled by Gordon Campbell, international goal-
and wicket-keeper.
“Jim Carew”: I remember a couple of
cricket matches down Tilba (N.S.W.) way. In one
Bermagui was trying to play out time against Tilba.
Tilba was at the wickets and doing its darnedest to
make up a deficit of about 40 runs. The veteran of
Bermagui’s team (he must have been about 60) was
put on to bowl. He commenced sending down
“lobs” which went nicely over the batsman’s head,
just out of his reach, and were caught by the wicket-
keeper. The Tilba scorer marked down “wide” for
each ball so delivered and the Bermagui scorer
didn’t. Including the “wides” Tilba won by four
runs. When my boat left at half-past 11 the
teams were still fighting. Another time Cobargo
and Dry River were playing the final match of a
competition at Dry River; and when the last man
went in Cobargo wanted three runs to win. Cobargo’s
last hope had been a player 30 years previously, and
smacked the first ball hard towards the fence, a
Dry River man ran after it. The boundary was a
ploughed furrow about two feet inside the fence. The
ball struck a post, hard, and bounced back about a
yard inside the boundary. The fieldsman did not
put up bis hand to signify a fourer. The batsmen
continued running, got two, and in attempting a
third one was run out. The Cobargo team and its
barraekers swore they heard the ball hit the fence,
while the whole population of Dry River said that
the ball never reached the boundary. Dry Creek
had the numbers that day, so it won.
Iv. B. Fraser was the versatile all-rounder
at Sydney University inter-collegiate championships
last week. He won the 120yds. hurdles (17 l-ssec.)
and 44yds., and was second in the 100yds. and
broad jump. Sprinter W. 11. Hutton took the
100yds. (10 4-ssec.) and 220yds. (23 4-6 sec.), and
ran second in the 440yds. The high jump was a family
affair in which H. W. Harbison defeated R. liar-
bison at sft. lOin. —which is better than world’s
champions like Banks and Baker have been able
to do in other years. Tn the point scores Wesley
and St. Andrew’s were level (16 pts.) from St. Johids
(9) and St. raid’s (7).
* * * *
Paddon announced definitely last week
that he would claim the sculling championship of
the world, lie suspects that his challenge arrived
before Felton and Barry signed up. But it is
mere suspicion. The others decline to talk on
the subject. They are disposed to treat the in-
sistent Paddon as though he were off the eartn;
and they certainly will not open their archives
for inspection by him and his backers. Failing
the necessary proof Paddon remains more or less
of a voice howling ineffectually by night in a
yard. The weakness of liis position is that he is
palpably trying to get something for nothing. He
didn t meet and beat Barry, and create a renewal
of interest in a sport which had been on the verge
of death. He remained comfortably at home and
let someone else do it; and now he wants to call
the tune for those who have paid the piper. No
wonder his efforts are viewed unsympathetically
by the general public.
The great event has been fixed for August 28,
at 3.30 p.m., over the full Parramatta course.
That will represent “still water” as nearly as not to
matter, with what slight tide there is against the
scullers.
* * * *
Barry was helped into the sculling busi-
ness by Jim JChute, now of Perth (W.A.). Chute
bought the Englishman his first pair of sculls.
Writing of the Prince’s day with the
Christchurch Hunt Club, Keith Murdoch perpetrated
tli-e unforgivable bloomer from the standpoint of
tile sporting Britisher. “The dogs,” he remarked,
“were set off at 11.30.” “Hounds” nre “laid on”
in the hunting field, and to put it differently is an
offence somewhere between employing a false Greek
quantity at a university and wearing sandshoes with a
top-hat at a garden-party.
Digger Evans is as game as a tiger-cat,
and he is a great natural boxer; but he has no
punch. Joe Symonds, the wonderful little English-
man who met him at Sydney Stadium on Saturday
night, dropped to this fact after the first three or
four rounds, and from then onwards the Digger’s
cake was mud. In the fourth round Symonds felled
the A.I.F. rep. with a terrific short left to the jaw
and again with a right to the stomach. The Digger
hit Symonds about 15 times in the next round, and
then Symonds hit him—once. Evans went down for
five and was dazed when he got up. The indomitable
little R.S. spent most of the ensuing three rounds
on the floor. Early in the eighth he stopped a de-
vastating right and left, and fell to rise no more.
* * * *
Frank Moran, the ageing Irish-Americau
heavyweight, seems to have had no trouble with
Goddard in London last week. He outed the enemy
in decisive fashion inside two rounds. Tommy
Burns has announced his intention to tackle Joe
Beckett, and Carpentier favors Battling Levinskv.
but on recent performances Moran looks a more
formidable proposition—and hence a better draw—-
than either the Cockney or the Hebrew. Moran
stood up to Johnston for 20 rounds in the latter's
palmy days; and Jess Willard failed to knock
mm in 1916. With challenges flying round in all
directions—due chiefly to London’s revived interest
in pugilism—a remarkable feature is the almost
monastic reserve and quietude of Dempsey. The
champion has evidently no intention of risking his
title, unless absolutely compelled to do so, against
even the feeblest opposition.
E. L. Apperly won the Hampden Cup
last week at Rose Bay (Sydney), where the home-
less members are living in lodgings. The matches
in this event are against bogey—a fashionable method
of play towards the end of last century, when the
series was begun—and Apperlv finished one “up,”
which was good going in all the circumstances.
The reliable C. W. Rundle (one down) was second.
Baylv Macarthur, the barrister, who was a champion
25 years ago, was one of the entrants.
THE QUICK AND THE DEAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The oab-ranks receive some. A little time ago
I saw Zircon, at one time a well-known racer, in a
vehicle at a funeral.”— Argus.
One time he champed a silver bit
Within the saddling-ground,
So wonderfully slick and fit
The people flocking round '
Upon his steel-strong limbs to dote
Would stroke his shining velvet coat,
His fine performances would quote.
He flashed before the storming crowd
Upon the rosy lawn,
His satined jockey pert and proud,
lie lissom as a fawn,
And wise ones, seeing him so slim,
Yet fine and fit and sure of limb,
Made haste to put their shirts on him.
To-day he drags a leaden hearse
To where the dead men lie,
In gloomy trappings, and a curse
Of bale is in his eye.
I wonder does he ever long
To race once more, and beat the throng
To prick of spur and touch of thong ?
For he was proud and full of fire,
And fiercely strove to win,
And nobly, like his star-browed sire,
He bore his colors in.
“Live wire,” they called him; now is fled
All pride, each trace of beauty shed—
He’s daily running with the dead.
Yet there may come in his sad plight
A compensating thrill
Of vengeance grim, but apposite,
As he toils up the hill,
And pulls within his heaVse at last
A rider, shortly to be “grassed,”
Who often pulled him in the past!
VICTORIA.

The Benefits of Boxing
have been recognised by all Institu-

cise it affords, its moral advantages
are great. It insures confidence it
teaches self-reliance —it shows the
folly of bad and hasty tempers —it
quickens the intellect —it affords
healthful occupation for the spare
time of youths, that might otherwise
be less beneficially occupied.

If everything didn’t go well at the landing
it was not for want of preparation. Several
xehearsals have been described, but one which
did not get into the papers was held at Gov-
ernment House. A distinguished gathering
uas asked to. imagine that the ball-room was
r V i l . P ier 5 chairs carried card-board
labels indicating the positions to be occu-
pied by those present on the great day. In
the centre a Vienna said in black type that
it was “H.R.H.” _ Then came the question
ot precedence, and more than furniture was
involved. Dignity and indignation stalked
like grim spectres through the hall. For a
time it looked as though the G.-G. would
have to read the Riot Act, but he threw
whisky on the troubled water and the cigars
of peace followed. Beneath many a courtly
waistcoat, however, there burned an angry
heart. The bentwood “H.R.H.” was the
only person present who found proceedings
aV 11 cu °*'* : the Prince programme
the Masonic, fraternity protested, quietly
but was unheeded. Then the chieftains,
headed by an ex-Premier, sent out the fiery
cross. Lights had appeared on only a few
lulls when authority recognised what it was
up against and sent forth a herald with a
Mag of truce. An invitation was cabled to
Edward asking if he felt inclined to turn
out in his apron. He replied that he would
be delighted, and fixed his Royal dad’s birtli-
(/one 3) to fraternise with the Vic.
United Grand L*odge.
When the Argus put up a bold electric
placard across her place of business with
i? i Wor^s Bod Bless Our King,” even the
old lady’s best friends had an uneasy feeling
that here was possibly a case of senile
amnesia. A few days later, however, grand-
ma permitted them to breathe more easily
by putting up a further array of globes
to outline the melting words, “And Our Brave
Prince.” What an old dear it is!
They are telling of a rich suburban family
that has been issuing invitations to a birth-
day party, the chief inducement to guests
being an intimation that acceptance would
afford them an opportunity of meeting the
I mice. When expostulated with by a
doubting Thomasina, the proud mother re-
torted, “But we intend to send an invita-
tion to the Prince.” “If you do he won’t
come, ’ was the reply. “Oh, don’t fret your-
self on that score, 11 the good woman re-
torted, swelling visibly—“my cousin is
mayor of (say) Gluepot!”
A man rang an advertised address to
book a window in Collins-street to view the
Prince procession. It proved to be in a
swanky lingerie shop, and a small
feminine voice answered the inquiries.
“How high is the window from the floor?”
asked the man. “Just up to my waist,”
rippled the voice at the ’phone. <: Thanks,”
he said; “I’ll call.”
Sassafras, the little beauty spot in the
hills, is growing hysterical. The Sassa-
frasians are to entertain 50 officers and 100
sailors of the Renown at lunch on Sunday.
They do say the Prince may have lunch with
the Hugheses in the hills and then take a
bush salute at the luncheon-rooms. At any
rate, Sassafras is having five miles of triuni-
phal arches and bunting. Fifty cars at
least are honking up from the city. The
road goes to Fern Tree Gully and then
climbs.
Because Australia swears by Paris and
New. York models, Sassiety will not be ap-
pearing in the right garb to greet young
Edward. Queen Mary can’t control all the
Empire’s dressing, but she issues very exact
instructions in the matter of feminine dress
at Court. The evening gowns must show
the pink of propriety rather than the pink
of bare flesh. The bodice must not stray
more than so many inches below the chin,
and skirts must hang a very exact number
of inches (in proportion to the height) be-
low the knee. Presumably a guest who is
suspect is hurried off to be audited with a
measuring tape. Garden-party frocks have
to meet other specifications.
The invasion of country people for the
visit is much below expectation. Several
extra trains had to be cut out. The country
is very busy looking after its starving stock,
and there is no money to splash in the city.
The Prince made some mistakes in the
lancers at a Maoriland ball. He will know
all the moves of the ancient thing before
he leaves Australia. It is to be performed
at every ball of importance.
Government House listed two dances: one
for the night of the landing of the Prince,
the other for Friday, June 4. A lot of
women are relieved. Dressmakers have been
working overtime, and if the creation was
not finished by Wednesday there is a chance
of a parade at the second vice-regal hop.
It seems that the dance the Lieut.-Gov.
is going to provide for the Prince on June
2 will have no “official significance.” This
non-official hop, paid for by the official
Irvine out of his official salary, is intended
to “give his Royal Highness respite from
entertainments of a more ceremonial char-
acter.” If the young man is in dire need
of respite from ceremonial entertainments
he surely could find somewhere better than
a State Government House to be free-and-
easy in.
The new Tasmanian Governor’s private
secretary is Mr. Wentworth. He was with
Churchill, and the cut of his clothes de-
lights local fashion experts. They say in
hushed voices, “Bond-street, my dear!” Then
again he wears his hat at a fascinating
angle. All the naicest Slowbart youth are
practising it in secret.
Lady Allardyce and her two step-daughters
are already installed in Melbourne for the
celebrations. One daughter has been shop-
ping here for three weeks.
The Baldwin Spencers, who have been liv-
ing for some time in that gilded portion of
Armadale where the retired squatter has his
nest, sold out the other day to Hamilton
Baird, of Warrong. The Baird property
has been acquired by the State for repatting.
Canon Alfred Wheeler, the ex-precentor of
St. Paul’s, who is one of this country’s minor
composers, had lately to submit to a some-
what complicated series of operations. He
is now out of St. Evin’s and danger, and
will soon be in collar again.
As mourning for her young hero-husband,
who was dashed to death when trying to fly
to Australia, Cicely Howell proposed to wear
a silk dress, said to have been bought in
London for £37, if she could get it dyed.
She had worn it only twice, she alleged,
when she handed it to a dyer whose name
in Melbourne is a household word. Put-
ting aside momentarily her grief, she in-
spected the dress when it was returned from
the dyer, and was so dissatisfied that she
sued in the County Court for £4!) damages.
Judge Woinarski decided that 40s. and costs
would cover any deterioration, as upon ex-
amination of evidence he found the com-
plaint had “largely evaporated.” Mrs.
Howell is an Australian who spent some
years in England before Captain Howell
wooed her.
Banool, the mansion in Studley Park-
road where Geoffrey Syme, of the Age,
pluckily assisted by a children’s nurse,
grappled successfully with an armed burglar
a few years ago, has been pulled down. The
land has been cut up into blocks, and about
20 villas are being built. Geoffrey Syme
never cared for the place after his ‘tre-
mendous tussle, and Blythswood, nearer the
Yarra in the same neighborhood, is now the
Syme home. It was here that Geoffrey was
reared when David, his father, was master.
Athol Levey, M.8.E., is proudest of her
decoration because it is military and not
civilian—the ribbon has the scarlet stripe
through the purple. She had gone t-o England
on a pleasure trip, and was there when the
war embers broke into
a flame. First she
and her father went
pottering about in
tile East End, trying
m do something. Then
she got into canteen
work in France; and
in the early days of
the war that was
strenuous enough
for anybody or any-
thing. At last her
health broke and she
was sent back to
England. Men were
training men to drive
motor-transport o f
all sorts: but men
were getting scarce.
... „ She battled with the
VVar Office to allow women to train women
for those jobs. The idea was good, and for
a start eight women were appointed to teach
girls to drive cars and motor-cycles. Athol
Levey was the first of the eight. To com-
mence with, a duchess lent her garages
Then the thing grew. In no time they
had 100 girls at work, all crazy to be fit
for a job in France. But their work was
nearly all at home, releasing men for ser-
vice across the Channel.
Miss Levey has just returned to Australia
ana Alice Mills got this picture of the ener-
getic young person as she looks now Like
all other Australians, she is happv to bp
home. “Everybody in Australia seems
rich, she says. After the war she was in
France, helping the poor, who are terribly
numerous. She was in the country from
which the Chasseurs d’Alpes went out.
Scarcely a man of them returned, and their
widows and orphans are in dire straits.
Monte Carlo is swarming with the selfish
rich, who are buying up precious neces-
saries like milk and eggs while the war-
widowed mothers and children scramble or
starve. Some of them are starving. Fresh
milk is practically unprocurable and pre-
served milk is at a price far beyond their
means. Says Miss Levy: “Australians who
have not seen cannot realise the luxury we
are living in in this wonderful land of
plenty.”
Phyllis Ashley (photood hero by Lafayette)
is the tuneful little singer who played Fran-
cesca in Claude Haydon’s opera of “Paolo and
Francesca” at the Playhouse the other even-
ing. Phyllis sang
very sweetly on that
occasion, though her
first-night nervous-
ness prevented her
putting all her feel-
ing into her voice.
The taking young
novice is the daugh-
ter of popular song-
stress Evelyn Ash-
ley, and skipped off
with the soprano
championship in the
A.N.A. competitions
last year. She also
won the Conserva-
torium Scholarship
in 1919 and 1920.
O. F. Sobell, the
Uni.’s chief voice-
carpenter, says her future is big with hope.
Israel met Israel when Lazarus, on behalf
or plain till Ozanne, started cross-examining
Monash. Both parties to the engagement
w ® r f, P°“te, but Lazarus was the more
affable and insinuating of the two. “You
would not say that Ozanne was guilty of an
offence calling for any punishment?” was
one persuasive question. “Yes, I would ”
was the prompt reply, whereupon Israel in
tie wig remarked sadly: “I am disappointed
in that answer; I did not expect you to
say that. ’ Ozanne, who sat at the bar-
risters table, looked alert and hopeful. No
trace of anxiety overspread his ruddy coun-
tenance. Daughter Joan Lazarus, whose
star part in the performance was the cross-
examination of Hughes when he was in the
box, did not figure in the later proceedings.
Mis. Buesst lately had a birthday party
which was also a farewell. She goes off to
Japan, America and England. There was a
little jazz, but it was mostly music—the
music-room in the Buesst house is a place of
great importance. The hostess herself, who
piovided some of the music, was arrayed
tor the rites in rainbow brocade and tulle.
Norah Delaney pounded the piano; Walter
ivn by carolled one or two of his precious
songs; Gertrude Johnston trilled some
Italian opera; Mrs. A. E. Y. Richardson,
who dropped professional work when she
married, came out of her retirement and
from the cycle of Hindoo songs; and
Minnie Waugh also had a place. Mrs.
Hugh Ward came to the party full of the
tatigues of a tram journey and the loss of a
diamond of great price during the trip.
The Women’s Automobile Club got
together for a jazz party at Wirths’ Palace on
hriday night. Members took cabaret tables
and half the floor, and persuaded the
musicians to play on for an hour after the
scheduled closing time. Cars were banked
up the kerb five deep. The night was per-
fectly chilled for dancers, *and the cabaret
coffee was smoking hot.
The idea behind the frivol was to raise
funds for the Club, which has not got very
far forward financially in its couple of rooms
and yearns for cosy residential quarters with
an acre or so of garage attached. Mrs.
Secretary Lambert was in black flimsies.
Her hair is bobbed, so she dispensed with
the hat that is a mark of the smart jazzer.
A jazz hat is made of jet or gold lace or
something spangly, and goes with a tulle
dress that is often cut to the waist-line.
Mrs. Russell Gabb has an advantage over
the locals because of the trousseau she
brought from New York. Mrs. Stuart
Murray (once Frankie Oliver) was there, and
shuffling with the best. (She had just
landed home, and knew all the latest steps.)
Frankie’s hair has turned a beautiful snow-
white, and she wore lavender tulle. It made
a good powder-effect. Mrs. Stein—she is an
ardent jazzer—wore a big hat with her
amber-colored clothes. Mrs. McCullagh wore
black below the waist-line and a very snug
three-cornered hat. Aviator Major Harrison
and his wife were the envy of the crowd ;
they had a brace of naval officers at their
table. Mrs. (Dr.) Tom Boyd got a good effect
with a hunter s pink topping to her gown.
Mrs. Liddell, just back from Sydney, bor-
rowed the plumage of a little pink ostrich
Ernest Brookes danced earnestly. The elders
get, bitten very badly by the jazz habit,
rsorman Brookes foots it well; his tennis has
helped him. Mrs. Norman glittered all over
with moonlight blue sequins. Commander
Ramsay Smith showed a nimble toe or two
and a few middies streaked in and had a
dandy time. Lolly-manufacturer Macßobert-
son has two very dainty flapper daughters
who appeared dressed like his very best sugar
confections.
The Jazz Palace is brushing itself up.
Fresh decorations are everywhere, and there
are new private supper boxes in the balcony
hidden by carnation-pink curtains. In the
big outer space, where the circus has its
cages when in town, there are cloakrooms
and dressing-rooms.
Major Harrison, who used to boss the
Point Cook aviation school, is back from
active service abroad. His new job is at
the new depot at Fitzroy. There they
are busv assembling the parts of the
numerous aircraft sent from England and
tuning up a fine flying squadron for the
Prince’s visit.
Adelaide lias a look round: —
Government House is being tidied up in pre-
paration for the arrival of the Weigalls, and
young aide-in-advance Somerset is having a busy
time. It is said that all Lady Galway’s wardrobes
could not accommodate the wealthy Weigall dame’s
pocket-handkerchiefs. Her Ex. was the daughter
of Blundell Maple, the furniture millionaire, and
apparently intends to entertain royalty in style, so
the debs. are hoping for the time of their lives.
The new people bring with them Marie Louise, a
daughter of Princess Christian, who had to divorce
her German princeling many years ago.
Social Adelaide turned up in force on Saturday
night to the opening of “The Man from Toronto,”
played by Courtneidge’s London co., just arrived.
It had been a wet afternoon, and the races in the
rain were as depressing as the frocking at the
show.
Mayoress Moulden is unwearied in entertaining.
This week’s programme included two morning recep-
tions, two afternoon ditto and a small dance on
Thursday evening to meet Capt. Nigel Somerset.
A committee of prominent women is arranging
a dance for July 9, to enable the officers of the
Renown to meet Adelaide’s prettiest girls before the
arrival of the Prince.
The Palais de Dance still attracts, and on Thurs-
day held a crowded fancy-dress carnival. It Is
becoming a habit to give cheery little dinners and
motor in afterwards for half a dozen dances. It is
even whispered that at a very exclusive but rather
boring dance given lately some of the younger people
slipped away for a couple of hours to the cheerier
atmosphere of the Palais, arriving back in high
spirits for supper.
The first Allied soldier married in Amiens
Cathedral was a Clare boy, Driver George Edwards,
the bride being Ernestine Sueur, of the Hotel Lamar-
tine, Amiens. ’The Australian flag, hung in the
famous old shrine aifter Villers-Bretonneux, was
transferred from the chancel to the altar in honor
of the happy Digger.
Back in Adelaide for a visit after an absence of
24 years, Major E. L. Makin, of a well-known S.
Aus. family. He was at Cambridge when the Boer
War started, and got to it by joining an English
regiment, with which he remained. He won a D.S.O.
in the recent war, and has since been general staff-
officer for coast defences at Portsmouth.
At the Austin-Cunningham wedding the
bride was draped in white satin (which is
now considered more toney than georgette)
with a real lace veil and a loose train, which
was held up by little Paddy. The satin
draperies of sister Mary Cunningham and
Gwen Nash were topped by tulle cap veils.
One girl was a harmony in mauve, the other
in primrose. Bridegroom Leslie wore his
khaki.
Provided that the right man can be found to
conduct it, a State orchestra is to be estab-
lished, and the Government will guarantee
up to £4OOO a year. Ministers feel pretty
confident that if the promotors, who have
the Lady Northeote fund as a nucleus, get
hold of a Verbrugghen, the show will be
self-supporting,
Mrs. Brandon Ussher is visiting Mel-
bourne before she goes off to Japan. Musi-
cal daughter Constance (Mrs. Simpson
Baikie) lives among the chrysanthemums.
Little Dorothy Vane has become a widow,
Norman Menzies, to wed whom she left the
stage, having faded out last week. When
Dorothy first appeared at the Princess’s 20
years or more in “La Poupee,” theatre-goers
took her to their hearts, for she was. a fas-
cinating doll, and they had a bit of an
ache when she gave up to a husband talents
seemingly meant for mankind. Of course
Ivenningham, as the tenor in the first flush
of his success, _ helped materially to popu-
larise the comic opera, but Dorothy was
the chief draw. She learned some years
later, when she returned for a while to the
boards, that the public is fickle. Few can
hold it permanently like Maggie Moore.
Harrison Owen and his wife (she was
Ettie Dyson) sailed by the Ormonde on
Saturday. Before their departure the pair
were _ provided with much free food, and
Harrison O. delighted his fellow-workers at
the Herald by his witty response when they
made him a presentation. Good speakers
are few among the press gang. Owen is
looking forward to the variety of Fleet-
street, and his wife is happy at the thought
of meeting brother Bill again.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
From
Daid Jones
SYDNEY
The officials who are stage-managing the
Prince’s visit to N. S. Wales have abori-
ginal ideas. They have arranged a State
banquet for the bucks of the tribe
in Sydney Town Hall, and have invited the
lubras to squat in the gallery and see their
masters feed. Black Brother threw what-
ever of the baked ’possum lie didn’t fancy
to his gin ; and it will be a pity if the old
plan is departed from even in this detail.
Julian Ashton (looking much better, God
bless him) talked mostly of tntth in art to
an audience made up of Pen, Pencil and
Palette; and the Woman Painters’ Club
brooded greyly upon his wisdom. There’s
a sort of “silent upon a peak in Darien”
atmosphere about the Club these times in
contrast to the gay frivolling and the purple
and fine linen of last year.
For the first time since Governor Hamp-
den’s lady instituted it, the Sydney Needle-
work Guild held its exhibition outside the
magic precincts of Government House. This
time the beautiful stitchery found a resting-
place at Merioola, the Arthur Allens’ home
at Edgecliff. Two garments are the mini-
mum timt each member is to provide—remin-
iscent of the refined young lady’s trousseau
that contained absolutely two of everything.
After the members of the Guild and as
many of its friends as can squeeze in have
duly admired, the various occasionals and
what-nots are handed out among the hospi-
tals and homes for the Guild’s less-favored
sisters.
The week-end Moiseiwitsch concert at the
Town Ilall was like a Paderewski or a
Melba night: 3000 delighted people inside
and a hopeful multitude outside. Among
the insiders were a bunch of Daisy Ken-
nedy’s relations from Ashfield; Daisy her-
self, in black, with Oriental touches in the
swathed sash; and sister Mrs. Miller (a
war-widow, so it is stated) in blue and gold
that had a kimono effect from the back
when she sat down. One musical enthusiast
had come out in a hurry, forgetting to fasten
an intimate sub-section of her dress. Close
to her sat another, leaning back, eyes closed,
feet spread straight out and supported by
the rung of the chair in front. Roy Agnew
sat aloft wishing that he was one of the
composers on Benno’s programme; but Roy
is not dead enough. Gordon Lavers was
there, and Max Selinksy, and the Berliner
youths, and Bertie Kelly with a galaxy of
beauty and intellect.
They have made Joan of Arc a saint, poor
girl
Dr. Boismenu, who bishops in New
Guinea and who was present at the Joan
of Arc celebrations, can trace his ancestry
back to the days when one of his forefathers
had a hand in crowning Charles VII. of
France, for whom Joan fought, at the his-
toric cathedral of Rheims, nearly 500 years
ago.
Lucky little kiddies whose dad and mum
had five shillings to buy an afternoon’s fun
for them streamed into the grounds of
Eynesbury. the Albert Goulds’ Edgecliff
home, one bright but cold afternoon last
week —tiny buds of girls in their petalled
frocks, others dressed as the old-time Panta-
loon and little boys in their best suits with
freshly-shined faces. There was danc-
ing on wide verandahs and on the
green upper lawm that hedges itself
from the lower - terraces and from the
blue w 7 itch of Port Jackson behind a cold
stone balustrade. Little tree and fern fairies
peeped greenly from their hiding-places at
Frances Scull’s pupils, and that same evening
under the rays of the slim new moon they
tried over all the new'est steps—for the
household caught them at it. Down the stairs
to the left you came upon the tiny tots of
all, with some escaped small boys having the
time of their lives on the chute and in
swinging-boat and see-saw 7 ; a peanut hunt
had its enthusiasts, and Mrs. Chris Ben-
nett and daughter Mrs. Robins worked over-
time at the ice-cream headquarters, that
being the rendezvous of all.
Her Ex. came late to the party ; but the
two youngsters were there from the moment
of opening. Sirs. Anthony Hordern viewed
the revels, conjuring with a crutch in as
fascinating a way as the grass w'idow in
“Lightnin’.” (It’s only a tennis sprain and
no consequences looked for.) In addition she
wore royal furs and a hat that had stripped
some sky-blue bird of its plumage and left
it not a feather to fly with. Mrs. Arthur
Allen, Mrs. Tom Watson, Eadith Hill and
newly-returned Mrs. Westmacott were
among other supporters of the cause, which
is St. Luke’s Hospital. Mrs. C. Bickerton
Blackburn was chief agitator of the whole
disturbance.
The linen-chest at the Ityde Home for
Incurables should be safe for the next few
months, judging by the mob of fashionables
who drew on their dancing pumps and jazzed
in the St. James’s enclosure the other even-
ing. Old friend of the home Fred Searl
turned up trumps again, and saw that the
hoops of golden chrysanthemums were
happily arranged. The Wade lady was pre-
sident of the flutter in lots of black jet and
a pink bouquet; and daughter Doris helped
her white satin frock with panels of black
velvet. The Fuller miss wore black net
and covered her share of the family’s aching
bosom w'ith roses red. Mrs. Eyres, whose
eye never leaves the Home’s profit and loss
account, wore millions of sequins on black
satin; Miss Cook brought pretty Lorna
Arnott, whose cheeks and frock blushed the
same shade of pink; secretary Mrs. Sliute
laid down her pen and fastened on a pretty
pink frock; and treasurer Mrs. Maitland
Gledden was all black and jet trimmings.
This is the last photograph that will be
taken of Miss Badham, Principal of the
Church of England Girls’ Grammar ever
since it sprang into being at the request
of the members of the Church Council, and
.started with a few students in a house in
Victoria-street. Among those first pupils
were Mrs. Antill Sargood and Mrs. Swift
(then May Watson), and among the
school’s first teachers was Mrs. Dunn, then
Miss Boscoe. Soon the school outgrew its
first bounds and had to look for fresh fields ;
so 26 years ago the house and grounds of
the Deas Thomsons were secured. The
grounds then stretched from Forbes-street
to Bourke-street, in
its day quite as
swanky as Darling
Point. The Thom-
sons had not lived
in the house for some
time, so the wonder-
ful flower-bed that
divided the in- from
the out-side of
the wide-sweeping
carriage drive was
not such a thing of
perfect joy as some
of the old family
visitors remember it.
Bourke-street, in the
passage of time, los-
ing its tone, the
Church Council de-
cided to dispose of
the frontage, and keep only the Forbes-street
entrance. But the Thomson house remained
unaltered, with its wide glassed-in veran-
dahs and its wide stone steps; and here it
was that Miss Badham made her home. And
here in the drawing-room she had
placed the Canova bust of her grand-
mother modelled when that lady with
the exquisite profile and beautiful throat
was honeymooning in Italy. Here, too,
it was that Miss Badham thought out
the Greek plays and the pageants for which
the school is famous, Miss Badham being
recognised as one of Australia’s leading
Greek scholars, as her father was before
her. No elocution teacher or teacher of
dramatic art w'as allowed to even whisper
a suggestion as to the rising or falling inflec-
tion or the Shakspearean gesture. The
principal worked with each girl separately
and thought out every detail of costume and
background, and then rehearsed them as a
company as strictly as any producer re-
hearses the season’s success.
Ascension Day has always been the school’s
day of re-union. Old pupils who coufd not
come for the early service and the breakfast
afterwards came in the afternoon, latterly
displaying a tendency to be accompanied by
their babies. This year for the tirst time
in its history there was no meeting at the
old school; the girls met at Farmer’s, in-
stead of in the assembly hall, where
the portrait of Miss Badham by her niece
Ethel Stephens hangs facing the stage. At
the other end of the room stands in state
the big chair carved by the girls of the
school, and by each old girl within coo-ee,
for the use of the beloved principal on high
days and holidays. It seems not so many
Ascension Days ago since Mrs. Sargood, then
Mrs. Antill, unveiled the portrait; this last
Ascension Day her cabled good wishes found
their way to a very sick principal lying in
Lister Hospital.
Miss Badham never failed the girls in
their hours of sadness or of fun. She was
the girl who never grew' up, and until the
poor finger that caused all the trouble be-
came so very bad, she took her girls every
Monday across to Mosman on their boating
expeditions; for the slight little woman
with the big brain was a real “’Varsity fel-
low 7 ,” and in addition to the dead languages
considered the proper stroke an essential
part of a lady’s education.
Miss Dumolo is the head of the Kin-
dergarten Training College that supplies
teachers for the Free Kindergartens of the
city, and this is Judith Fletcher’s picture
of her. There’s a new free ’garten to be
built at Surry Hills; up to the present
the kiddies have
learned their songs
and games under the
roof of the Church
Hall. To get in
pennies the com-
mittee of the centre
has opened a tea-
room in the common-
room of the Conser-
vntorium, with Mrs.
Walter Newman and
Mrs. Fairfax Smythe
as presiding angels.
Members of the com-
mittee play waitress,
and Miss Hall is one
of the consistent
helpers. The girl
and boy student can
now worry their
bone or bnn on tbeir own mat in a suitable
atmosphere of crotchets and quavers; and
every bun bought means a brick, or at least
a thimbleful of mortar.
There was a particular poignancy about the
tragedy of poor young Montague Stephen’s
death last week. He had only recently
arrived from Maoriland with the young wife
whom he had married over there; and he was
still on his honeymoon—at the Allens’ place
at Moonbarra—when he was attacked by
pneumonia. His father, Consett Stephen,
was with him to the last; but the attack
was one of those extraordinarily violent
ones which leave little hope. His brother
Adrian was killed in Flanders, so this
branch of the family is now represented by
only one son.
Double-pneumonia carried off a cheerful
soul last week when it took Mrs. Frank Con-
nelly, who was a Dubois, of Hunter’s Hill,
and related to a lot of R.C. Sydney.
Slipped away, suddenly, at Townsville,
the elder Dr. Nisbit, father of Major J.
Nisbit, who served with our Field Ambu-
lance. Another son is a middy of the Re-
nown, who, after being left behind in Eng-
land with ’flu, arrived by the Naldera last
week ; so it is a sad homecoming for the lad.
Dr. Nisbit practised in Townsville for about
30 years, and nearly all the village filed past
the casket as it lay in the old doctor’s
surgery. There was a semi-naval funeral,
to mark his one-time connection with the
Navy.
The Women Painters have a programme
of uplift lectures arranged for winter even-
ings. On May 24 the Rix Nicholas lady
talks of “Art in the East,” and supplies
her audience with horrible examples. Muni-
cipal librarian Bertie will take the ladies
for a walk through old Sydney on June 24;
color-music maker Hector will flash the
green, the reds and the yellows of your
musical chords before the naked eye; and
Arthur Streeton will make an evening wish
it was longer. t Eight is the hour, and one
shilling the gate money.
Mrs. E. Reynolds, who used to be sweet
little singer Maie Sydney, returned last Fri-
day after several years’ residence in India
with her husband. Captain Reynolds. She
is looking for health.
Mining-man Jack Whear Roberts and his
wife entertained violinist niece Daisy Ken-
nedy and her husband, Benno Moiseiwitsch
of the magic fingers, at dinner at Paris
House the other evening. The other guests
comprised personal friends of the host and
hostess. Niece Daisy, after “hanging up the
fiddle and the bow” for over two months,
looked as piquant as ever in black charm-
euse with ostrich feather trimmings; and
fair daughter Ethelwynne wore a Frenchy
confection of pink charmeuse and shimmer-
ing blue brocade.
Some Brisbane gossip :
Every known type of craft that could float turned
out for the inter-State rowing the other Satuidaj.
The Lieut.-Govemor and Mrs. Lennon entertaine i
a big party on the Lucinda, and the river bank*
were as crowded as though Gabriel had just blown
the assembly. People who paid 7s. 6d! to get into
the enclosure were furious because the gates ve.e
left open and swift outsiders rushed all the from
seats for nothing.
Dark-eyed Stella Mooney, who is to be married
next week, is being tea-ed almost daily. Mrs. J. J.
Buchanan and Mrs. McKenna hostessed a party at
Finney’s, and Mrs. McDermott and daughter Edith
passed the sandwiches in her honor at their home
at New Farm.
Teddy Cahill and George Brooke are the first
“foreigners” to give a command performance in the
palace of the Maharajah of Benares. Both music-
makers were presented with elaborate souvenirs.
Nell Prentice, who is to be married early next
month to Tom Bignell, of Avondale, a returned
Digger, was guest of honor at a kitchen-tea yester-
day. Mrs. B. B. Whitehouse was the hostess.
On board the Naldera, which brought its
row of funnels into Port Jackson on Mon-
day morning, came Ella Bussell, the Irish
soprano. Her husband, Stanley Mott,
arrived earlier by the Ceramic, and he and
his wife have found a Coogee flat for them-
selves and the children. Ella has appeared
almost everywhere, and has a fascinating
specialty, “The Folk Songs of All Nations.”
In the days when European kings weren t
two a penny she gave many “command”
performances. She was singing in Dresden
when war broke out, and had a rough time
getting back to London. Then her husband
shouldered a rifle, and she busied herself
with war jobs. Her last was that of police-
woman at Gretna Green. The old black-
smith’s shop still stands there; but a new
town has been created about it in connection
with a war-explosives industry.
Rev. Fred Greville, rector of Narrabeen,
tied the knot between his brother, the Rev.
Alec, rector of Coraki, who was padre with
the 56th, nnd Evelyn Rose Beetham, of the
Coast Hospital, elder daughter of Mrs. Beet-
ham, of Waverley. Bride's brother, Lieut.
Reg, who before enlisting was on the staff
of the S. M. Herald, handed her over.
The undergrad, smashed her mortar-
board on to her “bobbed” head (a drought-
stricken squatter would have cheered at the
sight of so many crops), draped her gown
scholastically, and prepared to do her bit
towards the Uni. Women’s Settlement. The
Women’s College had emptied itself in the
good cause, for late principal Miss Mac-
donald had been one of the founders of the
Movement. Dame Margaret came to be-
stow official blessing, which she did in grey,
made in the cavalier-cloak style, carrying
many buttons and much silk fringe and sur-
mounted by furry animals. In addition she
wore irreproachable silk stockings in tone
with the silk fringe on the quarter-deck of
her garments. A be-winged and violet-tinted
hat surmounted the whole. Mrs. Barff in-
troduced the lady from Government House,
obviously very nervous over the disappear-
ance of a supporting Professor who, becom-
ing hypnotised at some of the fancy stalls,
arrived not at the dais till all the wording
was over. Gladys Marks, who always has
a speech up her sleeve, seconded the thanks-
giving, and Miss Henderson smiled on all.
Daphne and Diana disappeared into the
dips, from which they emerged every now
and again rather breathless. The flower-
stall girls, all yellow and brown, reminded
you of early daffodils breaking through the
brown earth. The quad, harbored all the
usual stalls; and everybody, including Mrs.
Holman, in dark green, found her way into
'the chilly bowels of the building in the hunt
for tea, and found both it and sunshine in
the Fisher refectory.
Mrs. Freehill, whose beautiful frocking
has been a feature of the Australia, has left
the great old caravanserai and bought
a beautiful home at Point Piper. It will
run into £lO,OOO.
The good old hymn,
I would I were a cassowary
On the plains of Timbuctoo,
Oh, then I’d eat a missionary,
Hat and bands and hymn-book too,
has no application these modern times.
The Cassowary and Heathen Chinee alike
love brother Missionary and want more of
him ; so said the speakers at the Government
House assembly to boost the Australian
Board of Missions. Not only toilers but
cash also, and Miss Henderson and Bishop
Long made a stirring appeal for both before
an audience of good workers that included
Macarthur Onslows, Mrs. Clive Dangar and
the meek-in-spirit Judge Docker. Sam
Hordern wasn’t there, but his cheque for
£lOO came all right.
Mrs. Clive Miller, daughter-in-law of
Denison Miller, arrived in Sydney last week.
She was a Miss Chubb, and had been mar-
ried only a few weeks when she was left
a widow, young Clive being killed on active
service.
The Lawrance Carter pair (she sang as
Kathryn Stevenson) and two junior Carters
returned by the Ventura, after about a year
of the U.S. and Britain.
0 little maid of Domremy
Who whispered visions to your flocks,
I’- 1 ! down the Autumn wind with glee,
~ud puffed on thistledown for clocks,
In you were blent wide sky and shade
Of leafy trees on sunny field,
Till soul and heart in Heaven were made
For your loved France its flame-white shield.
On trench and battlement you stood,
Teaching your visioned war-like plan,
But only saw the little wood
Where wild the flowers ran;
Where all your thoughts flew up to God,
Like homing birds that wing to nest;
Where the first crocus pierced the sod,
A-fire to be Joan’s guest.
And you regretted most of all
The thistledown you blew for clocks.
The sun’s kiss, and the wind’s call,
And the visions ’mid the flocks.
In the long saintly calendar
Man carves your niche for all to see;
But the good God not very far
Has set your Heaven from Domremy!

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
IVo notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stumped.
Marne and address must appear on the MSS. Mo
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Splinter: You have a subject. Now get
seriously to work on it J.N.M.: Commonplace,
Azore: It isn’t a sonnet. Nearly every line
is out of scansion. And the idea isn’t worth while,
anyhow... .T.J.H.: “Imps of the Ipomea” flutters
too faintly F.0.C.: Very lame W.J.C.: Con-
dense the rather loose thought a bit; also note
that Arcady is not a city but the pet name for a
State in ancient Greece... .Swaglady: Hopeless....
T.D.L.: The story of the cat that wasn’t killed
used to make great mirth when the evenings were
long in the Ark... .F.C. (Fitzroy) :No use... .Mick:
You can’t rhyme “palms” with “arms” unless
you’ve lost one ear and have sand in the other....
Mayfair: Much too thin... .1.R.M.: There’s no
feeling for a garden there. .. .lestyn Mai: Too pon-
derous. And, after all, what docs it say?....
C.E.A.: Your first idea was right; they are not
worth whi1e....D.J.8.: Doesn’t get to anything.
. ...G.F.N.: Milk yarn too watery... .E.J.H.: Not
enough marrow in the bones.... Vag: Wanted more
point and force.... H.R.M.: “Homecoming” doesn’t
hang together... .D.M.S.: “Modern Romance” not
the sort of stuff we print... .W. 1.: The verse is
too thin and the yarn amounts to nothing....
F.K.S.C.: Poor attempt to make a story out of
moonshine....G.E.L.: Put the plane over it... .8.C.:
I “Libraries” is too faint 11.C.G.: The fact that
you say something while drunk hardly seems import-
ant enough to chronicle in verse....lion Mac:
“Open thine eyes, blind, foolish man, and see.”
That sort of note has no relation to the delicacy
of the sonnet... .T.O’C.: Labored verse without
quality.... Babctte: Say that the sun rose in a
mist and have done with it. The rest is simply
padding P.M. (Adelaide): No Oliver B.:
Beautiful little idyll:—
At draughts she was the best thing out,
She bet on black, would have to shout;
Silence, then the ringing cheer;
“Mine’s a pint, bring in the beer.”
Yes, she would play pitch and toss
With young or old, for silver or gold;
And make eyes even at the boss,
Untold of one so young, tricky and bold.
Then she could throw the dart,
Beat allcomers at the fair.
I toll you she is very smart,
Hear them whispering from where? From where?
Of all the sports was Dorothy,
A sport she cannot help to be;
To see her at afternoon tea,
Going as hard as a little bee.
. ...Chev: Misses... .C.L.W.: Nothing “vivid” there.
. ...E.M.L.: Both fall down.... Jarrah: N 0....
T.T.R.: It has to be a lot better than that Jack-
son F.: Nothing Grace E. C.: Don’t think there
could be any objection, but a letter to the lady
herself at this office would be delivered. Making
inquiries about the other G.A.C.: It keeps to
commonplace G.E. (Oakgrove): We do not
reprint... .L.B.AV.: Don’t know what the position
is now; but up to a few months ago the cost of
living (food alone) had increased more in Norway
and Sweden than in any other countries of Europe,
excepting, perhaps, Russia and Germany, for which
no trustworthy figures were available. The increase
was about 50 p.c. more than in the U.lf M. J.:
Collection of blots and scratches on both sides of
l>apcr. It rejected itself Ed. S.: Verse, so to
speak, got only as far as Parramatta on the road
to Bourke... .F.R.G.: “The Tragedy” ends on an
impossible note; the others are commonplace....
I. : How can you write of a book you haven’t
read?... .P.J.H.: Not well enough done... .Robert
J. : Very poor. . . .L.C.R.: The idea wanted all the
help it could get from the verse; and the verse
can barely pull itself along Edward R.: Your
verse reminds us of a picket-fence. .. .0.P.D.: Not
up A.C.C.: Doesn’t get near Shan (pro-
bably): It won’t do. .. .E.R. (Wellington): Tele-
gram about the sea has vile rhymies, and all its
barks are commonplace Cem: The “motor-kiss”
idea is good. Put a bit more work into the lines.
. ... S.C.M.: Very poor. .. . R.W.C.: Nothing in that
artificial stuff ; but you should get to grips with
things and do better.... V. de S. G.: “Have You?”
has a distinction of its own:—
Reading hard at night,
Alone in your hut,
One of Haggard’s ghosts
Arrives and then —but
You suddenly stop.
(Your eyes cease to read,
And your ears they twitch,
While all down your back
Creeps a kind of itch.
Your hair’s straight on top.
You’d like to turn round,
But you’re half-afraid.
Slowly your senses
Come back to your aid.
You’d like to caper?
Thoughts of dancing or
Doing a cake-
Walk have now all gone.
It’s only a snake .
Rustling on paper.
Nellie M.: Yes, you ought to simply be a mine
of good stuff; but you haven’t struck the right
vein yet. Try again Luluai: “Letter” is well
enough written, but lacks color C.: “Friends” too
slender L.S.: “Shunemployed” didn’t keep us
awake Alb.: Thanks for “Bible.” But it is too
much like helping ourselves to the butter Panni-
kin’s Mate: Too wordy. You’re not so much a mate
for a pannikin as a companion for a hogshead.

your rock drawings Clive G.: You’re beginning a
long, uphill job. First, get out of the habit of
drawing flat people. ... Geo. T.: Very cramped art.
... . C.M.: The ladies are not interested in each other.
F.S.: Some allegedly humorous drawings set us
thinking of the next world and our chances of escap-
ing the artist amid the flames S.H.: If the editor
in your drawing had any joints he would rise and
murder the horrible office boy who doesn’t fit his
American boots J.P.: Art in an invalid chair

Everyone Needs REXONA.
PIIYLISS and LESLIE BLAND, two bonny little
Rexona children (from a photo).
I have been a user of
Rexona Ointment and Soap
for the last five months,
and would now use no
other. When I arrived
home from active service
my skin was very rough
and blotchy. My wife, who
was using the Soap for the
three children, recom-
mended me to try the oint-
ment, and after using the
first, small tin (1/6) my
skin was normal. We
would not be without either
Rexona Ointment or Soap
in the house at any time.
I am sending a photo of
two of our children, which
I hope you will like.
I have not yet tried your
Rexona Shaving Soap, but
intend to do so.
I remain,
Yours faithfully,
CHAS. W. BLAND.

All the world over everyone

They are universal favorites,
and never disappoint you.
Rexona is the Rapid Healer,
and Rexona Soap is the facial
soap of the century. Care for
yourself by using Rexona
and Rexona Soap, and your
skin and hair will reflect the

and you will delight your-
self as well as your friends.
Rexona the Rapid Healer has always
been famous for its wonderful healing
powers. Many people now thank
Rexona for skin health and comfort.
It is a reliable remedy for cuts, burns
and all irritations and eruptions of the
skin.
Those who have once used Rexona
■and Rexona Soap wonder how they
ever got along without them. So don’t
forget to take a pot of Rexona the
Rapid Healer and a tablet of Rexona
Skin and Facial Soap home to-night.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Let my soul be keen as a knife
And its voice clean as a bell,
For I would love life
And hate death well.
Shall the end come creeping
Like a poison in slow wine
Till between dying and sleeping
Is all that was mine?
Shall I lie with poppies that fal l
Drowsing and drowning my head
Till under their red pall
The morning find me dead.
Shall I sit between dreaming and waking
In a music of no tone .
While the blood that is mine is aching
To claim its red own?
Shall I stand in a great fear
Making a still prayer
While the black wings and drear
Are cold on the air?
No; but in hate of death
I shall love life so well
That for prize of my breath
Death shall call on hell.
And there shall be trumpets blown
And thunders of great strife
Till God speak on His throne:
“Is it death? Is it life?”
Michael out of the dawn,
Abd : el striding the sea,
With white swords drawn
Shall stand over me.
With the black balance swayed
In the terrible red sky,
I shall stand unafraid
And see death die.
N.s.w.
DAVID MCKEE WRIGHT.
Felicity.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HM HE unfortunate incident of the holey
I dollars that were abstracted from the
"** cavity below the foundation-stone of
St. Matthew’s Church at Windsor early in
October, 1817, has been before related. Mr.
Calder‘s connection with it —although it
never became fully known in all its details to
Macquarie—had been sufficient to earn for
him a renewal of that pained distrust with
which the Governor had regarded his aide-de-
camp since the latter had joined his regiment
in the beginning of 181 G.
“I fear, my dear Elizabeth,” he remarked
to Mrs. Macquarie during a discussion of the
young officer’s prospects—-“I fear that it was
a grave mistake on my part to keep him here
after the departure of the 46th for India.
But you know what a friend of mine his
uncle, poor Jack Calder, was. When he died,
and this young reprobate came in for his
money, it seemed to me that by appointing
him my aide, and keeping him under my
personal observation in the colony, I might
in some measure save him from himself. Yet
I sometimes have my doubts whether it is
within the scope of human power to divert
his steps into a path that will lead him to-
wards such honorable destiny, as I, or, to
put it better, as his worthy uncle, would
have hoped for. I almost regret that I kept
him here. He is certainly the most execrable
aide-de-camp that any man in my position
was ever afflicted with. Execrable!”
“Oh, my dear Lachlan,” smiled his good
lady, “I am sure you do him only scanty
justice. Perhaps he may be a little thought-
less at times, but he is really very present-
able, is he not? And to me, as well as to
my niece Felicity, he is full of attention.
Indeed, no one could be more politely con-
siderate of our comfort and convenience. He
spares himself no trouble in arranging for
our little diversions, and such expeditions as
we make from time to time —to Sydney or to
the Hawkesbury or elsewhere—would not be
nearly so pleasant as they are were it not
for Mr. Calder. This morning, for instance,
although he tells me that he is particularly
busy just now, he has spared a couple of
hours to take Felicity out a-riding to Castle
Hill. So good of him !”
Macquarie smiled grimly.
‘Tt is, indeed, my dear —extremely good of
him. I would almost suppose him to be gifted
with some supernatural powers of divination.
He always seems to absent himself in your
service—or Felicity’s—when I require his
attendance. It had been my intention to
send him to Liverpool this morning with a
despatch for the Commandant there. But his
zeal in the truly important function of show-
ing Felicity the view of, Parramatta from
Castle Hill has frustrated my intention of
making use of him in such an unimportant
matter as carrying on the business of the
Territory. However, he will ride across to
George’s River this afternoon, and will re-
turn with Captain Bateman’s reply to-night.
It will be quite two o’clock in the morning
before he gets to bed. Well, well —it is very
hard on such a zealous officer! For to-
morrow he takes another despatch to Spring-
wood, on the Blue Mountains. It is a pity
that his hours of sleeping should be so cur-
tailed.”
Mrs. Macquarie laughed a little soft laugh.
“My dear Mr. Macquarie, I don’t think he’ll
grudge it a little bit.”
“And why. my dear?”
“Oh, you’ll learn why one of these days.”
She smiled as she looked up into his rugged
face. “See, here they come. What a nice
pair they make, don’t yoft think so, Mac-
quarie?”
“Humph! Felicity is all right,” he said
drily.
They were standing in the garden before
Government House at Parramatta —which
was then, in 1818, quite a new building and
a favorite residence of Macquarie’s. Down
below them the waters of the river sparkled
in the January sunlight, the young oaks
'"“re in full leaf, and the blue hills across
the valley were almost purple in the heat-
haze. Over where the old buildings of The
King’s School stand to-day was an orchard,
and just beyond—not far from the northern
end of the bridge that David Lennox built
in the ’thirties —rose the wails of the gaol.
Eastward from the hill on which they stood
the Ion? wide street that Governor Phillip
had laid out in the earliest days formed the
nucleus of Parramatta, then the second town
in all Australasia. It was from that direc-
tion that the red coat of Ensian Calder and
the white muslin of Miss Felicity Campbell
slowly approached, as they walked their
horses up the slope towards the vice-regal
residence.
“Send him in to me, my dear,” said the
Governor as he turned to enter the house.
Mrs. Macquarie nodded, and went forward to
greet the young couple.
They dismounted at the gate in the dwarf
wall enclosing the garden, and Mr. Calder
handed the reins of both horses to ap orderly
who had hurried from the guard-room as they
approached. He assisted Miss Campbell
from the saddle, and followed that exception-
ally dainty and sweet-faced young lady into
the garden. Her cheeks were pinker than
usual as she approached her aunt, holding
her long, white habit from the ground in a
little gauntleted hand, and her eyes were glis-
tening in a fashion that meant one thing
only to the smiling elder woman.
“Oh, Auntie,” she almost whispered, “I’m
so happy!”
“My dear, I’m so glad.”
Mrs. Macquarie clasped the girl to her
for a brief moment, and turned to Mr.
Calder, sailing at his obvious awkwardness
and embarrassment. He stood a few paces
away, seeming too shy to say anything, with
his shako in his hand —a trim and well-
groomed young officer—and his handsome
face was very red.
“Well, Mr. Calder, and what have you to
say to me? Am I to call you Patrick?”
She smiled at him in a kindly and affec-
tionate fashion. She was very fond of her
husband’s “execrable” aide-de-camp. But
his shyness moved her laughing pity.
“I am very—very happy, too, ma’am,” he
growled in a lugubrious tone that was due to
nervousness.
“His Excellency requires you at once,” she
said. “I fear that you are in for an inter-
lude of tmhappiness, my dear Patrick. But
nothing matters, does it?” she smiled, plac-
ing her arm about the girl’s waist.
Patrick put on his shako and pulled him-
self together, grinning sheepishly. He saluted
and turned towards the house.
“No. ma’am —nothing matters!” he re-
sponded as he left them. “I’m damned if
it does!” he muttered to himself as he went
inside.
* * * *
The ride from Parramatta to Liverpool
was a hot and dusty one, and it was not
much short of sunset when Mr. Calder
handed over his despatches to Captain Bate-
man, the commandant of the little settlement
on George’s River. That gentleman opened
the document, glanced through it with a
frowning face, and swore fiercely when he
came to the end of Macquarie’s communica-
tion.
“D —n my eyes and limbs!” he observed
peevishly. “D’ye know what he wants, Mr.
Calder? D’ye know what he’s put on to
me? Good Ged, sir—good Ged ! And I’ve
had the very Devil’s own day of it!”
“No, sir,” said Mr. Calder, a little stiffly.
He did not like tins Captain Bateman of
the 48th, for the simple reason that they
had once had a slight difference over a girl
of no account. “I do not read the confiden-
tial despatches his Excellency entrusts to me
for delivery. All I know is that I have Mr.
Macquarie’s orders to await your reply, and
that he expects the return to be completed
in the shortest possible time.”
“He does, does he? Then ye’ll have to
wait half the night, Mr. Calder. He wants
full particulars about every prisoner em-
ployed upon the public works at George’s
River —sentence, where tried, ship he came
out in, personal description, and character.
A pretty thing to spring on a man all at
once ! Good Ged. it is! And my clerk’s ill
in hospital—so that I’ll have to do the d —n
thing myself. Lookye, sir, I won’t be able
to ask ye to dine with me. Pray accept my
apologies. I will have to do without din-
ner myself, if I’m to get this infernal thing
done to-night.”
“Pray don’t distress yourself, Captain
Bateman. I had intended dining at the : nn.
Can you give me any notion as to what time
to-night I may expect your reply? If you’ll
be so good as to inform me, I’ll call for
it.”
“ ’Pon my soul, Mr. Calder, I don't see
how I can expect to have the return made
out before one o’clock. Possibly not until
two. If ye’d call for it, say, at half-past
one, I think that it should be nearly finished
then. Mr. Macquarie says in his note that
he wants the information for his despatch
to Downing-street, which goes by the Alcibi-
ades the day after to-morrow, else I’d leave
it until to-morrow. Demme, I’m dead tired.
But you’ll be able to get some sleep. Well,
I’ll expect you at one-thirty.”
As Mr. Calder rode into the yard of the
Dog and Duck he heard his name called de-
lightedly from a back window of the inn.
in a voice that he knew well. He jumped
to the ground eagerly, threw the reins to
the ostler, and ran inside. At the back
door he was greeted with languid effusive-
ness in the drawling tones of Mr. Acting-
Deputy-Assistant-Commissary-General Pilk-
ington—his highly-esteemed and very unex-
pected friend.
“Gweat Heaventh, Patwick, and pway
what are you doin’ in thith outlandith
plathe?”
“By H —l, ’tis Brummel himself! Why,
I might ask you that, my boy. Me? Oh,
I’ve had to carry a despatch from the Old
Boy at Parramatta to this swine Bateman,
who’s Commandant here. I’ve got to wait
for an answer till cock-crow almost. Have
you ordered dinner? By Gad, I’m starving.
What’s your business here?”
“Oh, the uthual thing, Patwick. Weewi-
thithionth all wong. Got to make en-
quiwueth till I’m tired to death of the whole
buthineth. D —n the confounded thtoreth,

up. I’ve a letter fwom Panthy in my
pocket—witten fwom the Cape. Let’th go
get a dwink. ’Tith an unecthpected

Mr. Pilkington tugged at the bell-pull in
his sitting-room, and it was answered by a

After Eight Months’ Suffering Operation Was Advised.
ZAM-BUK CURED HIM PERFECTLY IN 14 DAYS.
BEFORE Zam-Buk came to his aid, Mr. Harold Little, residing at 294 Boundary Street, Brisbane,
had suffered eight months agonising torture from piles, from which no other treatment had
brought relief, and for which he was strongly advised to undergo an operation. Instead he
used Zam-Buk, which banished piles after only a fortnight’s treatment. Chatting to our special
reporter about his cure by the great healer, Mr. Little said:—
“I had a bad attack of piles brought on through sitting on wet timber. For eight months I
was scarcely able to walk, and the pain and irritation were terrible. I had a very bad time of it with
them indeed.
“The doctor recommended the use of the knife, advising me to undergo an operation, but to
this I naturally objected. I thereupon decided to treat myself, and seeing what a splendid thing Zam-
Buk was in cases similar to my own, I determined to try the Balm. From the first application I
derived the greatest relief: Zam-Buk took away the inflammation, soothed the pain, bringing me
welcome relief, and continuing the systematic treatment with the Balm day by day, after fourteen
days I found myself thoroughly cured. I have not had a return of the complaint since, and my
consequent thanks to Zam-Buk are deep and sincere.
“I have always used Zam-Buk on other occasions for minor troubles, and always with the
greatest success.”
Zam-Buk is Soothing & Healing.
Zam-Buk is incomparably effective for
the treatment of running sores, bad
legs, eczema, ringworm, scalp sores,
cuts, burns, scalds, sprains, rheumatism,
poisoned wounds, ulcers, sore hands, etc.
Zam-Buk is obtainable at all chemists
and stores at 1/6 and 3/6 per pot.
IMPORTANT NOTICE.
When you ask for Zam-Buk Healing Balm,
see that you get it. Do not be put off with
something which is claimed by your trader as
“just as good” because it returns him more
profit. There is NOTHING “just as good” as
the proved, reliable, ever-ready and effective
“Zam-Buk.”
Zam-Buk gets right to the root of
disease. Thus the Zam-Buk treatment
is beneficent and wise.
ANOTHER PILE SUFFERER’S PRAISE.
“I was at one time a great sufferer from Blind Piles,” writes
Mrs. H. Mourat, of 8 Little Talmer Street, Darlinghurst, Syd-
ney. “They were very painful. I tried every cure I could
think of, but derived no lasting benefit from any of them.
Eventually I decided to try Zam-Buk, and I was restored to good
health. I have not been attacked since my cure by Zam-Buk.”

lii t h llicthellenthy made you Dieu tenan t-
Governor of Van Diemen’th Land—or
what. Indeed, you tlieem to have withen
in life a little! You do, indeed. What ith
it, pway?”
Mr. Calder did not answer for a few
moments, and Mr. Pilkington observed with
concern that his face gradually reddened
and his fingers fidgeted with his glass in
an alarming manner. He hardly seemed to
care about his drink at all. He had an
unusual air of shyness, of nervousness, of
having something upon his mind as to which
he was a little ashamed, and yet very proud
to have there.
After clearing his throat several times and
looking everywhere about the room, save
into Mr. Pilkington’s honest eyes, when he
spoke, he took his companion into his con-
fidence.
“Well, yon see, my dear Brummel—eh
—something extraordinary—that is to say,
a very fortunate thing has happened to me.
The fact is—all—Fm engaged to be mar-
ried.”
Mr. Pilkington looked at him solemnly
and proceeded to count upon his fingers.
“One—two—three—four—five. Yeth, ’tith
the fifth time you’ve been in that vewy
happy condition tliinth I’ve known you,
Patwick. I’m not thure ’tith not the thikth.
There wath Mawy Chalmerth, the mur-
dereth; Mitthith Molthey; Black Tom’tli
Bethy”
“Oh, shut up. you ass! This is serious.
This is the real thing. Nothing like any
of those affairs. ’Tis”
"And who, pway, ith the fortunate lady—
thith time?”
"Oh, you d —d ass! Miss Felicity Camp-
bell has honored me by consenting to marry
me. I’m the happi”
Mr. Pilkington rose to his feet, whistling
softly. After gazing at his friend for a
few moments he leant acrpss the table, and
extended his hand to the happy man.
“Patwick, I’m motht infernally glad. We
thall thelebwate the occathion. By
Heaventli, we will! God bleth my thoul!”
They did celebrate the occasion. Very
extensively. It was 2 o’clock when Mr. Pil-
kington assisted Mr. Calder into the saddle,
where Mr. Calder presently fell into a sort
of sleep. When daylight came his horse
was cropping the grass on the hillside to
the south of Parramatta.
“Great Mac!” said Mr. Calder, gather-
ing up the reins, and turning his faithful
steed in the direction of Government House.
» * * *
Mr. Calder was at breakfast when Mrs.
Macquarie’s maid came to his quarters with
a note, which requested him to come and see
her before he waited upon the Governor at
i) o’clock. Hastily finishing the cup of
coflee which had been the piece de resistance
of his meal, he made his way, by a round-
about route, to the drawing-room.
“I’oor boy!” whispered pretty Felicity to
him. “What a tiring night you must have
had! Why, you look quite jaded and
Weary !”
Patrick’s was not a very sensitive soul,
but lie felt —perhaps for the first time in
his life-—what it wits to be an unworthy
scoundrel. lie looked jaded ! Indeed, lie felt
it, too. So would you or I have felt had
we experienced the inevitable looming over
us so crusliingly as the depressed Mr.
Calder felt it. The wrath that was to come
almost made him shiver. But he sought to
bear himself as cheerfully as he was able,
and, in a minute or so, to his relief, Mrs.
Macquarie came into the room.
“Patrick,” she said eagerly, “we are going
to inform Mr. Macquarie this morning. I
should have done so yesterday only that
you were not here. In half an hour we will
come to my husband’s office. Now, do not
lose heart. You know that I am your friend
—and dear Felicity here is as much to me
as my own daughter would be. Cheer up!
For Heaven’s sake do not look so lugubrious.
Mr. Macquarie may seem stern, sometimes ;
but. really, he has a heart of gold.”
“Would it not be as well to wait a few
days?” suggested Mr. Calder, feebly.
“No, no—we must acquaint the Governor
at once. He would never forgive me did
we not do so. Do you go into him now, and
in half an hour we will knock at the office
door.”
“Don’t be afraid,” said Felicity, shyly, as
she straightened the aiguillettes upon his
scarlet jacket. “He is very fond of me, and
will do anything that means my happiness.”
When that timid knock came to the door,
his Excellency was almost literally foaming
at the mouth.
“You are utterly impossible, sir,” he was
saying. “Impossible ! Your carelessness and
incompetence are gross beyond expression. I
send you with a despatch requiring impor-
tant returns, telling you to wait for an
answer .from Captain Bateman. And what
do you do, sir? What do you do? You
actually return without them. Actually ! It
is almost incredible that you should be such
—such a fool, sir! And you have nothing to
say but that you ‘forgot.’ I tell you, Mr.
Calder, that I deeply regret having had any-
thing to do with you—-more particularly
having been so misguided as to appoint you
to my staff. You have been nothing but a
nuisance to me, sir. A nuisance ! You will
rejoin your regiment in India, sir. If you
will take my advice, you will resign your
commission from the Army—for which you
are utterly unfitted. I am sick of you—
quite sick of you. You would try the temper
of Job. Oh, come in!”
The door opened, and disclosed Mrs. Mac-
quarie, smiling and confident, her arm
about the waist of the blushing Felicity.
The two ladies beheld a very wrathful
autocrat glaring at a singularly abject Mr.
Calder. He was pale and wilting under
that fierce glare. To Mrs. Macquarie the
situation was evident at the first glance.
And, from the swift action of Miss Felicity
Campbell, her intuition as to the need of
the swiftest action if the situation was to
be saved, was not at fault either.
She disengaged herself from Mrs. Mac-
quarie’s arm, and ran across the room to his
Excellency’s side. Without giving him time
to gather his senses together she flung her
arms about his neck and kissed him.
“My dear little Felicity,” he exclaimed in
a sort of gasp, “whatever is the matter?
Mrs. Macquarie”—he observed his wife in
the doorway—“what is it?”
“Oh, dear Uncle Lachlan,” cooed Felicity,
“you must be nice to me and—and Patrick.
must! He’s such a dear. He wants to
marry me —and I’ve said —I’ve said ‘Yes,’
dear uncle Lachlan.”
Macquarie’s quaint face was a study.
Gently disengaging the girl’s arms from
about his neck, he leaned back in his chair
and regarded her with a look of amazement.
The black scowl with which he had been
favoring Mr. Calder faded slowly away—he
could scowl very blackly upon occasion—
and gave place to something that was a
blend of puzzled apprehension. He glanced
at pale Mr. Calder, standing sheepishly
before his table, and the scowl came again,
momentarily. But another look at Felicity
—and it was gone altogether.
She looked so fresh and sweet in her
white muslin dress, with a pink sash high
up under her gently-curving breasts, her
piquant rosy face all smiles and blushes,
her blue eyes with a suspicion of tears in
them, and her attitude one of gentle suppli-
ance, that the Great Man of Australia could
not find it in his heart to deny her anything.
He knew that she knew that.
He turned to his wife. “Elizabeth.
“My dear, you simply must approve. None
of us can bear that you should not do so.
Oh, Lachlan—don’t you remember?”
A look of great tenderness came into the
stern, rugged countenance. Presently lie spoke.
“Mr. Calder,” he said, “if I do not actively
disapprove of this —ah —arrangement, may I
hope for your written resignation as my
aide-de-camp?”
Mr. Calder could scarcely find his tongue.
But at length he murmured, hesitatingly:
“Why, yes, your Excellency. I am sorry,
but I”
With a wave of the • hand Macquarie
silenced him.
“Then take him, Felicity—and I pray to
Heaven that lie will be of more use .to you
than he has been to me. Only, remember,
’tis a life-appointment. You’ll not be rid of
him as easily as I am fortunately able to
be. Calder, you are a young dog!”
“Oh, you dear!" cooed Felicity.

The Telephone.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WITHIN a narrow house and high
A woman lives, and she is I.
All the days are silent there —
Silence listens on the stair;
In the bare rooms overhead
Silence sleeps in every bed ;
A brooding Silence sits beside
The kitchen fire that long since died;
A Silence in slow, stealthy shoes,
Like a wicked housemaid, strews
Fine grey dust along the floor
Of passage and of corridor.
And in the hall I wait alone
For a loud, quick ring at the telephone.
Is it long I have waited? I forget.
I wonder has a year passed yet?
But soon, ah, soon, it will ring. I know,
Shattering the stillness like a blow.
Trumpet-loud, clarion-clear,
Jarring the startled air to hear
Into a thousand bits —and then
When my heart has dropped from my throat
again,
I shall lift the receiver sliakingly,
And a miracle straight shall come to me.
“Oh, my Beloved. I forgive!”
Then we two shall belong again—and live!
Stiller the house grows and more still,
Only across the window-sill
The dust drifts faster and more white.
Hush! Surely it will ring to-night.
Nothing! Far footsteps in the street,
The tick of the clock and my own heart’s
beat.
Oroweth the silence more like death —
Woman, woman, hold your breath,
For if you scream it will never ring—
Never, never! O Lear, poor king!
The Silence peers at me round the door.
Listen ! In just one minute more !.. ..

right and give continuous service. Performance is the only thing that is
worth anything to you as a steam user. Our fittings carry the names of
makers which speak for reliability; they have proved themselves under severest tests.
The prices are right. Send us your inquiries for any of the following lines:—
Steam Valves, Fullway Valves, Cocks, Pressure and
Vacuum Gauges, Gauge Mountings, Lubricating Devices,
Injectors, etc., in Brass, Gunmetal and Iron.
