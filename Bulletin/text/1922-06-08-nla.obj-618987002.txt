The Re d Pa ge
A Padre on War Words
“The Progress of Words,” by R. L. Clay
(B. 4/5/’22), recalls the fact that there is
another movement going on alongside it—
the debasement of words. Words are like
coins; they are but counters. And just as
Coins get worn thin and have to be called
in, so grand old words grow thin, the “image
and superscription” is worn off. But unfor-
tunately there is no process by which they
can be reminted.
What happens is that these words begin
to stand for other ideas, often inferior to the
original, and whilst language grows and
more words are added, the additions • tend
to debasement, and some good words go,out
of circulation. War tends, not only to dis-
turb the social balance, but to upset word-
values and hasten word-debasement. For
one thing, it stops for a time the work of
higher authorship; and it is the work of
our poets and writers which keeps the lan-
guage pure by exalting great ideas.
When war comes we return to elemental
passions, and as man slips, more or less, into
barbarism, so language slips back with him.
Marlborough’s army and Wellington’s both
Swore terribly in Flanders, and Haig’s was
nearly as bad —would have been worse, but
for the arrival of the “new soldier” Horn
the desk, the counter, the school, the news-
paper office, who taught the “regular” that
blasphemy did not always go with bravery.
The swearing soldier is passing, and the
cursing sailor is. following in his wake.
The Australian wa,s never the swearer he
was represented as being. Unfortunately
the superficial observer usually selects the
tail of the army instead of the body and
the head for his type. The “Aussie” soon
found out that the inferior units of the,
allied armies were the hardest swearers, and
he rose above them. But he was fertile in
his invention, and frequent in his use of
colloquialisms, diminutives and war-slang.
He shared this faculty with the better-class
British units, but he excelled them. Many
of the new words and phrases became tech-
nical, more were apposite—“short-cut”
words—and were so expressive that they
will survive. “Aussie” for Australian,
“possie” for position, “cushie” an adjective
describing a comfortable or well-cushioned
post, were all Australian, just as other
diminutives were in the language of affec-
tion. “Cobber” for comrade is good, is pure
Australian, and gets nearer the mark than
the English “chum,” usually “choom” with
the Northerners. “Swinging the lead” comes
from the Navy, and is an excellent simile
for a methodical search for a good anchor-
age at a base, on a back-area 11. Q. staff, or
in hospital or a convalescent home.
There never was a “Billjim” except in the
Australian papers; the word will pass out,
in fact, is nearly gone.. “Digger” is, a title
coveted and often stolen. It originally meant
the infantryman or artilleryman who was
always “digging in” or rebuilding his para-
pet after enemy fire. He dug to live, and
was as much at home with the pick and
shovel as with rifle or bayonet. It did not
mean a staff-officer or any of the A.I.F.
serving in Palestine or Egypt. It meant
the man in the front line Tn France, and
no one else. It is ridiculous to talk of the
“Digger. Prince” or to use the word for
A.I.F. men indiscriminately; and it is mere
swank when claimed bv men who did not
dig. There were no “Diggers” at Gallipoli
where we dug most—the word had not come
then! It is too much to hope that it-will
get back to its original meaning, and it is a
striking example of the debasement of words.
“Dud” Is just right as a description of a
shell or a man who succeeds in everythifig
but in tliq job he is specially designed for.
Another phrase which, like “dud,” was of
British origin is “putting the wind up.” It
arose from the military. phrase of “being in
wind,” that is, left unsupported on the
flanks, or unreinforced in the rear. To be
cut off, to be enfiladed with no supports or
communications was a terrible experience
in such a war as the last.
It would be hard to find a more suitable
word than “stunt” in a war which was a
combat of wits and where both sides were
always inventing new “frightfulness” and
ruses. Every new adventure was a new
stunt and required new methods. The Boche
words “strafe” and “hate” were freely appro-,
priated. At Anzac Cove we gave and received
our regular morning and evening “hate,” and
at every raid or attack or, indeed, whenever
there was a “hopoyer,” it was to “strafe”
the Boche.
To “carry on” has passed out of the drill-
books. and has become part of our regular
speech. There is no army without its “eye-
wash.” In the R.A.M.C. it often meant
“lime-wash.” An inspecting officer some-
times took it for granted that if the paths
were well swept in a field ambulance or
casualty receiving station and the align-
ments marked by white-washed stones, the
patients were well looked after. “Eyewash”
was found in “reports of actions” ; the greater
the failure the more “eyewash.” If the
movement was not successful, at least the
troops were brave, and if the casualties were
numerous the whole force was “gallant.”
If unable to push the enemy back, we were
assured that we had prevented him being
employed to reinforce the line to the east
or the west. It was served up for “home”
consumption hy the war correspondents
—the Censor saw to that. It will
pay us in the next war to realise that
the “home front” cannot be kept up bv “eye-
wash.” If war debases language for the
time being, breaks down the purity of lan-
guage—and morals —it presents a great
opportunity for a new beginning. Let the
poets and the -writers come now and write
the epics in undying words. Let them catch
the ardent flame of the soldier in battle,
lifted up beyond petty selfishness for the
moment. Let them take hold of the great ideas
which form the base-lines of progress for
humanity’s onward march. Let them flash
before the world the larger truths and the
broader charities which make civilisation.
rs have been usually followed by intellec-
tual awakening, and the progress of our
words °-eps on again to express the. progress
of mankind.
JAMES GREEN.
“Vae Victis!”
Ten Years at the Court of St. James,
by Baron von Eckardstein (Thornton, But-
terworth, Ltd.), provides yet another lesson
in the impermanence of Loyalism, the insin-
cerity of the clamant King’s Man. The
author began his career in a Cuirassier regi-
ment, but soon transferred to the Diplomatic
Service —chiefly, he says, “because he could
drink without getting drunk.” His social
life in England was spent in “the Prince
of Wales’s set” —the cheery, hard-living,
hard-gambling crowd that so scandalised the
Nonconformist conscience of England at the
end of last century. In the incredibly idiotic
quarrels which occurred between the Prince
and Wilhelm the Baron, according to this
book, always sided against his own
sovereign. The tendency becomes still more
marked when the Prince becomes King.
Three days later I was suddenly telephoned for
to go and see King Edward. I found him sitting
in his study with two papers before him. The one
was a letter from the Kaiser arid the other a long
despatch from Sir Frank Laseelles. lie received me
by saying in a tone that was only half-jest: “Well,
whatever hate you been about now ?’’ He then read
me some passages from the Ambassador’s despatch,
and after that a great part of the Kaiser’s letter.
At one pljce where it was dealing with Germany
and Russia he interjected, “Qui s’excuse s’accuse.”
He commented on the Kaiser’s assurances of friend-
ship for England with a sarcastic, “I hope that
is so.” And when he came to where the Kaiser
referred to British Ministers as “unmitigated
noodles” he laid the letter down on the table and
said to me, “There, what do you think of that ?”
After a bit I said, “Wouldn’t it be best if your
Majesty treated the whole thing as a joke?” He
laughed at that and replied; “Yes, you are right.
I must treat the thing as a joke. But unluckily
I have already had to put up with too many of
these jokes.”
The fact that Europe was allowed by its
chosen leaders (chosen chiefly, like Baron
von Eckardstein, for their birth and a capa-
city to drink heavily without getting sick
or quarrelsome) to blunder into the disaster
of 1914 is explained, in part, at least, by
the banalities over which the royalties
wasted their time and energy. In 1899 the
Prince and the Kaiser had made up one
of their queer, long-distance squabbles, in
which the reader gets a comic impression of
tWo elderly gentlemen sitting in England
and in Germany respectively, and talking
peevishly about each other to sympathetic
battalions of courtiers. “It seemed,” writes
the Baron sadly, “as though a new epoch
of peace and friendship was beginning be-
tween the rulers and the peoples of Great
Britain and Germany. But these rosy
dreams fled with the dawn.” The thing
that was supposed to have imperilled the
peace of the world was a telegram from the
Kaiser to the R.Y.S. objecting to one of the
club handicaps. The Baron almost breaks
down: —
This was a cruel blow. That same afternoon the
Prince of Wales sent asking me to come to him
on the Osborne. When he saw me he shook his
head and said: “It is really enough to make me
despair. Here am I taking the greatest trouble to
put the Kaiser straight to some extent with the
British public—and here he is beginning again to
throw mud at us.. ..You know very well yourself
what will be the effect on the British public of
such complaints as the Kaiser has made”....l told
the Prince that I quite agreed with him, and. begged
him to see that the telegram was not communicated
to the press.
As an interested member the Kaiser en-
joyed the right, if anyone did, to criticise
the R.Y.S. handicaps; the public of the
United Kingdom does not take the remotest
interest in the doings of this club, which
black-balled the only man who has attempted
seriously to boom British yachting in the
last 20 years; and there was no reason, in
any event, why the incident should have
been given to the press. But to the German
diplomatist and the English Prince the affair
was an international crisis calling for settle-
ment at the expense of all other work. Appa-
rently while they wasted time over such
fooleries the big business and financial in-
terests of Germany arranged the war. That
was Baron von Eckardstein in England.
However, when he crosses to Germany he
is as supple in the presence of the Emperor
whom, according to this book, he approv-
ingly heard derided in London, as any foot-
man. He writes his name in the Palace
book as soon as he arrives, is asked to
dinner, and, not even in these memoirs, does
he suggest that he even hinted to his royal
master what he says now he thought of him
then. One can easily visualise him on one
of these visits to Berlin—a splendid figure in
his white Cuirassier’s uniform, springing to
rigid attention in the street, hand to brow,
eyes glaring to the. front with loyal devo-
tion as the War Lord flashes past; or at
Court eager for a nod, faint with delight
at a word from Germany’s hope and pride;
or in his home rebukirig for disloyalty some
careless relation who has ouestioned the wis-
dom of the All Highest. Yet, now that this
emperor, who, for quarter of a century,
received, from men like Yon Eckardstein a
lip-service that did much to make the mon-
archical system ludicrous everywhere, is irre-
trievably down and out, his former servant
has nothing but scorn and abuse for him.
Practically all of this book which is not
devoted to social matters consists of insults
directed at the ex-Kaiser. They are, no
doubt, justified. But it is Impossible while
reading them to forget that not one word
of this would have been written if Germany
had won. If Germany had won the Kaiser
would have continued to be the half-divine
being that this man who wore his uniform
for so many years obviously thought he was
—until Germany lost. This phenomenon of
the King’s Man turning from the fallen
King is, of course, one of the commonest in
history. But it never ceases to be interest-
ing, psychologically; and there has rarely
been a completer or more nauseating, case
than this one of Barop. von Eckardstein as
presented by himself.

THOSE grunty, creaking,
rickety windmills that you often
see, are victims of friction. And
friction is fatal. It reduces the capacity
of the windmill, the bearings become worn
and have to be taken up, and the general
result is trouble with repairs all the time.
In “ COMET ” Windmills friction has been reduced
to a fine point. This is proved by statements of users
whose “COMET” Windmills have been running for
years without any real trouble from bearings.
“ COMET ” bearings are large and of the best material that
can be obtained—they work in a continuous bath of oil. The
long connecting rod, large diameter shaft, and ball bearing
turn-table are other important features which combine to
make a " COMET” the windmill of less friction —and longer life.
Send for booklet of testimonials and read what “ COMET ”
users say. Their praise will convince you that a “ COMET ”
is the only mill to buy.

He is Young at Sixty
“Sound as a bell,” says his
doctor. Every organ in his
body functions with the pre-
cision pf a well-kept machine.
He has a healthy mouth.
Contrast him with the man
of half his years whose wits
are dulled and body prema-
turely aged by Pyorrhea.
Pyorrhea is a disease of the
gums, but its infecting germs
seep into the system and de-
plete vitality. They travel in
the blood stream and may
affect the heart or kidneys, or
cause such disorders as rheu-
matism and anaemia.
Pyorrhea begins with ten-
derness and bleeding of the
gums. Then the gums recede,
the teeth decay and loosen, oh
must be extracted to rid the
system of the deadly Pyorrhea
germs which breed in pockets
about them.
Don’t let Pyorrhea become
established in your mouth.
Visit your dentist often for
tooth and gum inspection, and
start using Forhan’s For the
Gums to-day.
■ rr * T"
Forhan’s For the Gums will
prevent Pyorrhea—or check its
progress—if used in time and
used consistently. Ordinary
dentifrices will not do this.
Forhan’s keeps the gums firm
and healthy, the teeth white
and clean.
How to Use Forhan’s
Vue it twice daily, year in and year out.
Wet your brush in cold water, place a half-
inch of the refreshing’, healing paste on it,
then brush your teeth up and down. Use a
rolling motion to clean the crevices. Brush
the grinding and back surfaces of the teeth.
Massage your gums with your Forhan-
coated brush—gently at first till the gums
harden, then more vigorously. If the gums
are very tender, massage with the finger,
instead of the brush. If gum-shrinkage has
already set in, use Forhan’s according to
directions, and consult a dentist immedi-
ately for special treatment.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Autumn.
There is a crystal clearness in the air
Sweeping the languor from the sloping
plains,
A swift and shining radiance everywhere
After the weeping weft of summer rains.
The world shows vivid emerald to the sight.
The grapes grow purple on the clustered
vine,
The dawn is magical, noon a delight,
And sunset luminous as amber wine.
Night comes—a maze of stars and cornflower
mist—
The slim moon rises and a light wind
swells,
I see a form in rose and amethyst,
Catch laughter like a lilt of golden bells;
Yet when I wake, some morn, in swift sur-
prise,
Winter will greet me with her cold bright
eyes.

Overnight.
I thought that I would go content
Along life’s quiet ways,
And in this little homely place
Live out the tranquil days,
The passing of the sunny hours
Marked by the silver chime,
The while I gathered old-world flowers,
And herbs that grew by rose-hung bowers,
fresh mint, and sage and thyme.
But, oh, last night, the long hours through
I heard sea voices call,
And in my dreams I watched the waves
Break on the grey sea wall.
Upon my face I felt the spray,
The landward wind blew strong,
Until I woke, wide-eyed, and lay
Impatient for the coming day,
Thrilled with the sea’s deep song.
I heard, I heard the sea wind call
Throughout the long, long night.
At dawn I climbed the eastern hills,
And looking from the height,
I caught a glimpse of shining .sea,
A white line to the South,
And a song woke in the heart of me.
My thoughts like wild birds, joyous, free,
Flew to the harbor mouth.
Kind love is here, and quietness,
True hearts and friendly speech,
But I am in hot haste to go
Along the wide, wet beach,
Where tugging at the anchor ride
The slim-built sailing ships.
I hunger for the drenched quayside,
The restless rising of the tide,
The sea kiss on my lips.
The rose’s pale pink petals lie
For other feet to tread.
The sapphire sea lies spread for me,
The sunrise beacons red.
Before the wind I’ll travel far,
Exulting in its strength,
Till quivering beam and swaying .spar
Shall bring me, under some white star,
To harbor, safe, at length.

He rode with fevered eyes
To where she waited him.
O'er bracken, leaf and grass
He sped with and spur—
How long ago it was
Since he had looked on her!
Soon, soon to meet again,
To stand within her door;
And then, ah God ! and then
To live and love once more!
To see her dark eyes glow,
To lie upon her breast —
To love, and, loving, know
Earth’s best and Heaven’s best!
How still the stars and bright,
How silent wind and bird;
Behind him in the night,
What sound was that he heard?
The bliss, the joy, the thrill,
The peace for which he sighed—
It could .not be God’s will
That he should be denied.
There was no call of bird,
Nor was there sigh of wind;
What hoofs were those he heard?
What rider rode behind?
With rowels moist and red,
Through shadows huge and black,
Headlong in haste he sped
Along the midnight track.
Beneath the gumtrees stark
It seemed strange folk abode;
Behind him in the dark,
What phantom rider rode?
O’er deadwood roots and stones,
He thundered through the night;
What chilled his marrow-bones.
And made his cheeks grow white?
He saw her roof, her door,
The glow her night-lamp shed— :
“Oh, Love, for evermore

A still form stars shone chill.

The Car that
Costs Little to Use.
The Citroen has come into its own in
Australia. You see them everywhere, and
may know them by their ultra-smart body,
neatness and greater compactness.
Owners appreciate the long life and
economy of the Citroen. Tyre mileage is
unusually high; as much as 30,000 miles to
the set having been done; 38 miles to the
gallon of petrol; double helical gears in the
transmission that eliminate wear, friction and
noise in this part —these features testify to
the superior design of the Citroen. To under-
stand the luxurious comfort of the Citroen,
and the way it handles and drives, call for a
demonstration of this, the Worlds
Economy Car.

MORE MILLIONS FROM THE OLD
MAN.
Although the persons who supply Austra-
lia with its foreign news were manifestly
less interested in it than in a two-minute
scrap between a Frenchman and a London
Yid who spent the war years in America,
the Empire Settlement Bill, which has tra-
velled through the House of Commons with-
out opposition from any quarter, is a re-
markable piece of legislation. Remarkable
not so much for what it immediately pro-
poses as for the light it throws on the
economic condition of post-war Britain and
on the changed outlook of those who
have the ordering of its destinies, the Labor
party in particular. Amery, the Conserva-
tive author of the measure, has testified that
the reception it received from the Labor
Commoners was “generous” and “sym-
pathetic.” Yet the Bill embodies at least
one principle that the Labor party has
vehemently combated. It affirms (1) that,
under existing conditions, Britain is carry-
ing more people tnan it can comfortably
support, and (2) that the surplus popula-
tion, or so much of it as can be suiited
with mutuai profit, should be encouraged to
migrate to countries within the Empire.
* * * *
Not so long ago it would have been unsafe
to suggest to a British Laborite that his
small island was over-populated. His reply
would have been, supposing him to be a
man of peace, that when the mines were
nationalised, the landlords expropriated and
the factories and workshops taken over by
the proletariat, the United Kingdom—or
Republic—would be capable of carrying
twice 45 million people. But the war
changed all that. It brought the British
Laborite face to face with economic facts!
It taught him that a large part of his coun-
try’s wage fund was derived from its invest-
ments in foreign countries. In course of
time he learned that, since so many of these
foreign securities had been transferred or
mortgaged to America, and so many in the
Wage-paying classes impoverished by the ter-
rific taxation to which the Government re-
sorted, in an heroic attempt to pay off part of
the war debt and prop up the exchange value
of the pound sterling, the demand for labor
had fallen enormously, even though half-a-mil-
lion young Britons had perished in the war.
The supply of work has been further dim-
inished by the competition of foreigners,
especially Germans, who are willing to toil
for much less than the British worker is
accustomed to receive. In the result, as
the Labor politician has bitterly realised, the
country is passing through the most serious
industrial crisis it has ever known. Look-
ing about him he finds that hundreds of
thousands of men and women are out of
work, because there is no work to be got;
and the idea of a class-war to secure posses-
sion of unpayable coalpits, idle or half-time
factories and workshops and a relatively
small extent of farm and grass lands, incap-
able of feeding even half the present popula-
tion, he rejects with horror. Hence he has been
driven to accept the doctrine of State-aided
emigration. The Tory and the Liberal have
also accepted it, though not precisely for the
same reasons. And there hasn’t been even
a yelp of protest from the Little Englander,
if that sorry breed still exists. The “colonies”
are nowadays regarded, not as the “encum-
brances” they seemed to the early Manches-
ter School, but as ever-present helps in time
of trouble, inestimable auxiliaries to the Old
Man, both in war and peace. Says Neville
Chamberlain :
If the population of the Dominions totalled
50,000.000 instead of 15,000,000 there would be no
unemployment in Britain. Every emigrant going to
the Dominions produces employment in British indus-
tries.
It is a severely utilitarian view of the matter,
but Australia won’t quarrel with it.
Amery’s scheme is to have a modest be-
ginning. The cost in the first year is limited
to £1,125,000; and £1,125,000 won’t go far
among Canada, Australia, Maoriland and
South Africa. In the second year, however,
£3,000,000 is to be spent, one-third of it in
paying part of the emigrants’ passage-money,
and if results are satisfactory “a larger
policy” will be unfolded, which means that
the expenditure will grow. The only stipu-
lation is that an amount considerably greater
than the Imperial subvention must be laid
out by each participating Dominion on land
settlement, since, in Amery’s opinion, “the
direct settlement of men oh the land must
be the foundation of any policy for the
economic regeneration of the Empire.” If
this proviso is agreed to the British Gov-
ernment “will co-operate with the Dominions
in the promotion of land-settlement schemes,”
and even wdrk in with private organisations
like t'he New Settlers’ League. The Minister
is impressed with the proposals of Mitchell,
the Westralian Premier, for opening up new
areas. He is in favor of “schemes that will
encourage individual settlement b.v provid-
ing separate holdings”—whatever he means
by that. One suspects that the gentleman
has been read : ng the lucubrations of J.
Carruthers. That unreasoning amateur has
persuaded himself that any man, however,
untrained, can go on the land and make a
success of it, and. judsrng bv the enthusiasm
he displays when holding forth on details,
Amery is in danger of falling into the same
error. In the settlement of the Victorian
Mallee, and of the S. Aus. and Westralian
wheat areas, there were at least 50 per
cent, of failures. And if Downing-street’s
Parliamentary Secretary acts on the belief
that the average British emigrant can be
turned into a prosperous Australian agricul-
turist without being thoroughly tutored
in his new lob or caught young enough to
get “colonial” experience, he will live to be
sorry for himself and for his disillusioned set-
tlers. He would be well advised to beware
of boomsters like Carruthers and Mit-
chell, and to absent himself from the felici-
ties of Million Farms literature. Insti-
tutions like the Fairbridge Farm School and
Dr. Barnardo’s Homes, which are introduc-
ing British bovs and giving them a sound
rural training: and organisations like the
Ma State’s Country Promotion League,
which is forming committees of district
farmers to see that the immigrants
wibo settle among them aus placed on good
blocks, get every opportunity of learning the
business of farming, and are kept going dur-
ing the non-productive years—such institu-
tions and organisations are infinitely more
worthy of support than the grandiose
schemes of inflated old bores who would
chuck a multitude of novices on the land
and leave them to work out the ; r own desti-
nies on the root-hog-or-die principle.
THE WHEEL COMES FULL CIRCLE.
The backsliding movement towards a par-
tially black, brown or yellow Australia ap-
pears to gain recruits daily and from all
manner of places. A while ago the imported
secretary of the Seamen’s Union declared
that his organisation drew no color line, and
would admit 2000 qualified Chinamen as
readily as 2000 of any other sort. Labor
conferences at Melbourne and Brisbane fol-
lowed this up by going strong for the “unity
of the workers of the world” —the foreign
workers in our section of world being 99 per
cent yellow, brown or murky, and not a
safe lot to unite with. And traitors of an-
other political creed have been beating the
piebald drum to the tune of out “failure”
to settle the Northern Territory, which has
been losing population of late, just like the
Canberra country, and the Western division
of N.S.W., and half the minor towns in the
eastern part of the same State. This is the
plea on which Premier Barwell. of S. Aus-
tralia, has “gone nigger,” and after a little
bashful hesitation most of the Melbourne
press has followed suit. In fact, the wheel
has come full circle, and Colored Brother
occupies a place in the popular esteem
which would have seemed impossible a few
years ago. * » ,
A part of North Australia is suffering,
exactly like the State areas to the east and
west of it. from the trouble which afflicted
all Australia for a million years before Gov-
ernor Phillip drifted this way—isolation.
It certainly is a problem; but it is one which
many a half-breed republic would take in
its stride as a matter of course. Some day
a critical historian, viewing the Australian’s
capacity for being stopped by a molehill or
falling over a bit of fluff, may ask whether
he was quite a complete man, after all. He
may even ask if he didn’t get out of the
Grown Colony stage too early. Certainly,
since he came into his property he has done
little except dissipate it, accumulate debts
and be dreadfully sorry for himself—chiefly
on the ground of overwork and too few holi-
days for racing purposes. Among the things
he apparently can’t make are a new State,
a new port, a new town (he does really
produce a new town every 20 years or so,
but the old ones die faster than that), or a
new railway that will pay for axle-grease.
But he is great at the manufacture of “in-
soluble problems.” One is how to prevent
some huge city or other absorbing more than
774 per cent, of the population of the State.
This costs him many sleepless nights, while
his days are spent in building new railways
to the city, devising differential rates to
force all trade there, and seeing to it that
no other port has a railway, a good road,
a decent wharf, a dredge or a harbor board.
To a person with such gifts the making < f
a problem out of an area of rich land up
north is as easy as being present at one’s
own funeral.
* * * *
The process of becoming reconciled to the
colored person is liable to accelerate with
each year that the Australian spends doing
nothing and wallowing in self-pity because
so much good soil was left to him gratis.
Yet it is unlikely that anvthing will be done
till the country’s evil apnius, W. M. Huguvg
is evicted from politics. He represents
shiftltssness, shuffling, procrastination, un-
certainty and incapacity to the limit. His
long continuance in office is habitually quoted
as proof that he is really indisnensable, and
that there is no man of similar calibre to
replace him. The same argument might be
cited on behalf of Etfelred 11.. the most
durable of England’s Saxon kings, whose
death was one of the few good acts of his
fife: also of George 111., who endured to be
blind, deaf, imbecile and a mere whiskered
nuisance. The strength of W. M. Hughes
lies greatly in a knack of getting rid of men
who are really strong and honest, and in
their different way the last three cranky
monarehs of the Valois breed were similarly
gifted. In their case it was simply called
assassination. Hughes has been blessed
with more Federal office than any other
politiman, and during the uncertain muddled
years in which the Territory has been de-
veloping into a. problem, then into a horrid
jest, and finally into a nlaee where offer
people are beginning to dig White Australia’s
grave, he has been almost the whole Com-
monwealth Government in his own person.
And the verdict (or part of it) is:—
That he can’t populate a Federal capital, nor even
coerce a truculent State Ministry, which holds the
keys to the place, into building- a few miles of line
to give him access to his own show.
That he hasn’t the ghost of an idea how to bring
about a uniform railway gauge, though he has an
amazing knack of appointing one Commission after
another to tell the same old story about it.
That he doesn’t seem able to build a shack for a
returned soldier without making enough fuss for a
pathedral, and then the house is on the bias, and
costs twice what it is worth to build, and the same
amount to investigate the scandal and stench after-
wards.
That he can’t prevent his Federal railways being
a worse loss every year, and that he can’t get one
of his ships to sea except after a life-and-death
struggle with the union.
* * * *
The attitude of a section of the press,
especially in Sydney, is that any attempt to
oust Hughes is to be regarded as a base
Victorian conspiracy and resisted, even to
the breaking-up of the National party. Mean-
while 11 years (mostly years of Hughes)
have made the North such a place of despair
that the importation of coolies in order to
save it is freely advocated. And less than
11 more years may easily find the coolies
there. Yet 21 more years, if he lasted so
long, would find W. M. Hughes still send-
ing out funny men on bicycles to go over
the railway route and “report.” It is the
unfortunate nature of Hughes to finish no-
thing unless it be some galvanic business
kbout the appointment of a new commis-
sioner or the payment of a bonus. Now
a land ofi black people is black; a land of
white people is white; a land of no peo"’"
is the color of the soil, which is generally
brown. And the North is becoming alto-
gether too brown, though a crazed Federal
Government once sent as many as nine full-
blown Departments and an over-blown Ad-
ministration there as a substitute for an
ordinary working population. It was after
their failure that the Hughes Cabinet, or
rather, Hughes, who was the Cabinet, sent
(by sea) a Tasmanian Judge, and (over-
land) a long-distance bikist of amazing leg-
power to take the situation (whatever it
might be) in hand. After them nothing
happened save Royal Commissions aiid
strikes, and a drift south on the part of the
white inhabitants, until the recent move
started to syndicate the Territory, and, so
far as might be. populate it with niggers.
GRESHAM’S LAW IN JOURNALISM.
It began in Sydney shortly before the war
when the Sun, risen from the cold ashes of
the Star, addressed itself to the eclipse
of the inoffensive News. In those days
there was relatively little blood in the daily
press: and the public (outside a godless and
degraded few) was not supposed to be vastly
interested in the precise spot where the dis-
membered remains had been found. Few
editors thought of having the remains photo-
graphed. Came the world-cataclysm, and
home-made crime seemed pallid by compari-
son with what was going on abroad. In the
case of dipsomaniacs, drug-fiends and the
like, it is not considered advisable to insist
on sudden and total abstinence: the victim
is weaned from his vice bv. diminishing doses
of the enemy. It may have been on some
such humanitarian grounds that the Rvdne.v
editors hastened to temper their columns,
shorn now of overseas casualty-lists and their
dreadful appurtenances, with highly-colored
stories of hatred, lawlessness and gore in
Australia. The Sun, ever the pioneer, was
responsible for an interesting piece of work
in connection with a corpse which in life
had born the name of Raphael Tuck. The
body was photographed in the morgue \ the
office artist drew a stand-up collar and neat
tie on its neck, brushed its dishevelled hair
in a manner of speaking, and thrust the
result before his paper’s shuddering readers. It
was a scoop of scoops. The Telegraph, dedi-
cated for years to a Toryism so high as
almost to merit the attention of some kind
of inspector, suddenly made the discovery
that a* paper which loses most of its best
men ioses proportionately in public favor.
It tried to make amends for the fact that it
was no longer stating the case for ultra-
conservatism with brilliant versatility
every morning, by being bloody (usu-
ally in a somewhat diffident fashion) every
fortnight or so, and by the exploitation of
a hesitant, old-maidish form of L.0.L.-ism.
Its handling of the Tozer case (with
photograph showing the murdered man
as he lay when the police found
him) created a sensation very similar
to that which, may be observed in a remote
hamlet when the rector suddenly shoots the
curate dead, and cuts his own throat during
a committee meeting of the School of Arts.
There is charm in the unexpected, and the
Telegraph proprietary sold a lot of papers
over its Tozer scoop. Latterly it has been
doing well out of Bishop Leadbeater and
b ! s odd refutation. A few months ago the
News, with scarce a premonitory word,
bounued into the midst of the revolver-shots,
slashed throats, hanging criminals, outrages,
condemned cells, etc., and fleshed its brand-
new teeth in the weazand of the Sun.
This battle is still toward. It sways now
this way, now that. One day last week
the Sun published a photograph of a man
of 104 who was dying of pneumonia, the
camera having apparently been thrust in
his face while he was to all intents
and purposes in articulo mortis. The News
countered with a smiling picture of a lady
in an exiguous neck-to-knee bathing-suit who
had been divorced a few minutes before tlie
issue went to press.
Meanwhile the weeklies have not been idle.
The Sunbay Times, in a.n expensive moment
for itself, as well as for its rivals present or
forthcoming, adopted the Yankee comic
supplement. This meant that the Sun had
to do likewise, or lose the support of every
household with a child or more in it; and
even the News was driven presently to make
a bid for the same class of support in tike
form of a page which, if not recognisably
funny, is anyhow indisputably childish. Ai)v
paper would prefer to be without these excres-
cences. They are extremely costly, as well
as disfiguring, and the staff is bored by the
production of them and ashamed of the
result. But they are like diamonds at a
quiet Jewish dinner-party: if one guest is
known to intend wearing the things, all the
others will insist on doing the same for
honor’s sake. Smith’s, which has ptit
trousers on Truth, and in that guise is
penetrating every GoD-fearing clerkly home in
and around Sydney, has adopted a method
of having it both ways, of edifying the Good
and simultaneously gratifying the Bajd.
which, while not new, has rarely been ex-
ploited with such gusto. When the Telegraph
printed its Tozer picture Smith’s berated
the offender for conduct unworthy of the
Home or something—and then went
off to Long Bay and got a state-
ment out of the presumed lunatic who
had committed the crime. During the Gun-
alley proceedings Smith’s made of itself ; a
sort of camera obscura on which its patrons
were able to trace every step taken by the
central figure from his wine saloon to the
gallows. And last week the same journal
could hardly restrain its scandalised dis-
pleasure with the Sun for pandering to the
morbid cravings of the base by means of its
dying centenarian scoop. The Daily Mail
rather sheers off executions, assassinations,
stranglings, mutilations and so forth: its
specialties are more on the lines of the Red
Gross agitation, which it has exploited to
such purpose that many mild old gentle-
men are still leaping with rage at the light
east on their well-meant labors. The popu-
lace is always gratified by a spectacle of
this sort. And ever in the background
stands a self-consciously truculent figure-'—
tnoseo&rr, arresting, a noosed rope under one
arm, the ensanguined trunks of the Fiye
Headless Men of Noumea beneath the other,
and written across its iron mask, just be-
neath the halo, the adjuration: “Watch out
for Smith’s Daily, pot. She sure is coming
soon.”
* * * *
It provides a curious sense of restfulness
akin to that which is experienced on passing
from the uproar of a street row to the reti-
cences of a mortuary chamber, to turn
from the horrors, the banalities and the por-
nographies of a prominent portion of the
Sydney press to the Mahatma-like immo-
bility of the S. M. Herald. The Herald
stands for the old order which existed before
free, secular and compulsory education began
definitely to give results. In those days
there was a small, highly-educated claps
which read voraciously and had plenty of
time to do it in; and a large uneducated
class which rarely read anything—in fact
thousands of its members could not read. The
citizen who has attained a certain standard
of culture wants his politics discussed specu-
latively : Ihe is more concerned -with the poli-
tical principles of a Minister than with the
fact that, like the Pitts, he drinks or,
like Queen Victoria’s friend, Lord Mel-
bourne, makes love to other men’s wives.
This type of reader also wants more or less
serious comment on books, art, the drama and
world affairs. There is still a market for
such goods—a larger one than ever. But
there has grown up. side by side with it, an
infinitely bigger market, aptly represented
by the figures which the News labels “Percy
Public” and Smith’s “Dummy,” and their
families. The Herald is only keeping a grip
on them by means of its “In Memoriam” and
“Births, Deaths and Marriages” columns;
and by its advertisements of the jobs which
they are continually seeking, and the petty
swindles bv which they are continually being
fleeced, So that, the Herald’s doom as a
popular paper, while not exactly imminent, is
inevitable, And if seems equally inevitable


that the sensationalisation of the press
which has begun in Sydney will extend
all over the Commonwealth. In Melbourne
the Herald (under the same financial direc-
tion as the Sydney News) has already got
its pulpit-gallows iuto smooth working
order; and this interesting variant on the
U.S. wall-bedstead or sofa-cellarette idea is
in process of installation in the same city
by the Sun people. Just as comic supple-
ments lead to comic supplements, so scoops
induce scoops, and blood calls for more
blood. The Argus may yet be found
standing beneath the drop, notebook in
hand and kodak at the ready, wait-
ing for the body to come through, or
publishing an e(cpos6 (with appropriate Bib-
lical quotations, and elevating moral and
humanitarian reflections) of the Messalina-
like habits of one of the State or Federal
Ministers’ wives. What is certain is that
if it, and other dailies of its class, shrink
from the task, or approach it in any queasy
or niggling spirit, they are doomed.
WHITE SULTANS AND NIGGER
SERFS.
The people who are financially interested
iu introducing colored labor to Aus-
tralia, and their political and profes-
sorial spokesmen, are wise to confine their
arguments to generalities (“white folks sim-
ply can’t stand the climate'’) and avoid
details, as is their habit. I cannot claim
to have done much hard manual labor in
the torrid zone, unless humping a gun all
day over the rice fields, covering 50 miles on
a push bike, climbing active volcanoes and
keeping fit by boxing, tennis and football can
be called manual labor; but I have done
some fairly consistent slogging at a telegraph
key during the long watches of the tropic
night, and no form of work demands more of
a man, even in a temperate clime. 1 never
had a day’s illness in the hot places until
malaria knocked me over, and malaria is no
argument against the trooics, because, as
the U.S.A. has proved in Manila and the
Panama Canal zone, it is a preventable dis-»
ease, and, in any case, does less harm to the
white man on the Equator than influenza
and the coughs and colds of winter do to the
inhabitant of Melbourne.
The truly enervating influence in the
tropics is not the sun, but the coolies.
The sturdy colonists who carved cities
and empires out of the estate of hos-
tile Asiatics were succeeded by men
of the same stock, but subject to different
influences. The subtle corruption of slave-
labor undermined their energy. In that de-
pressing atmosphere municipal enterprise
languished. It was easier, if not in the long
run cheaper, rather than lay down mains
to let coolies carry your contaminated water-
supply on their shoulders. In Singapore
10,000 tukang kotors convey the sewage
out of the city. In Surabaya, in place of
electric fans, a punkah coolie waggles an
ineffective, germ-laden rag to and fro above
your head. In Saigon, Penang, Rangoon,
Batavia, there is this same indefinable air
of shoddiness and expiring effort. In Java
I have watched a couple of natives working
on the roads. They lift a stamp between
them while a third native sings the first
verse of a chanty, then they let it drop and
rest upon it while, the accompanist renders
the chorus and a few more verses. But
these were convicts at forced labor. The
free labor is even more instructive. I have
seen a hundred Madurese manning a wind-
lass which a six-horsepower engine could
have worked, while their white overseer
toiled harder than any of them. The small-
est number of servants considered adequate
to look after a white couple in a private
bungalow in India is 10, in Malaya five or
six. Amidst this atmosphere of listless syco-
phancy the white man loses his self-respect.
He invents, or his servants invent for him,
the most fantastic luxuries of personal ser-
vice, which he soon begins to regard as indis-
pensable to bare existence. His boy pulls his
boots off for him and takes his dog out for an
airing. And yet the same man will play
harder than an Australian navvy works.
Wherever men have been cursed with this
blight of cheap labor they have been cor-
rupted by it. The white population of the
Southern States of America during the slave
period was mainly parasitic; the European
miner on the Rand is an overseer of colored
labor. In Korea the Japanese peasant does
not flourish; it is the middleman, the ex-
ploiter of the cheap Korean coolie who immi-
grates. Men who can command the services
of others do not usually work themselves,
even in cold countries. In Russia during the
serfdom the propertied class were as help-
lessly dependent upon their slaves as a
Dutchman in Java upon his jongos, and the
temperate parts of the Roman Empire suc-
cumbed equally with the tropical when the
virus of cheap labor got into their blood.
In pioneering places in the tropics the
white man works harder than any native
could in opening up new country. I
have known many men who live healthy and
strenuous lives on rubber estates in Kedah
and cocoanut plantations in Borneo. It is
only in the cities that the doctrine of the
white man’s uselessness and general incom-
petence is accepted. The cities see the daily
deluge of ehean labor entering the country
and the sight depresses them. Almost every
morning an immigrant steamer discharges at
the wharves. There is a babel of tongues as
her cargo streams out into the town. It
approaches like a tumultuous army—like a
swarm of ants. It chatters the tongue of
Southern India, the most uncouth, the most
distracting language in the vrorld; or a dia-
lect of China. It moves helplessly like a
flo~k of sheep. It is kicked and threatened
by Sikh policemen, driven into corners of
buildings, takes refuge in huddled groups on
the Doiished steps of offices, and is forcibly
elected by Euroneans coming to open their
offices. It wraps its rags about its head
and lies down in resignation at the edge of
the road, in the middle of the pavement. It
is hustled off and comes to rest at
last in the courtyard of the Immigration
Bureau. There it stands or squats all day
waiting the attention of languid white
officials; beine fed bv native pedlars, spit-
tin?’ out the blood-red iiuce o f the betel-nut
until the courtyard looks like the scene
a massacre. Mere children feed
their babies at the breast—babies almost as
big as themselves. Women of immeasurable
age, shrivelled, tottering, sheer skin and
bone, stand there waiting to sign a contract
to do the labor of a healthy man. Diseased
faces, the bodies that seem in the last extre-
mity, peep out from heaps of rags. Boys
stand there naked, except lor the skm disease
which clothes them Irorn head to toot. A
thousand odors, animal and vegetable, go up
to Heaven.
It is a terrifying army that hunger drives
out of India and China to serve the greed of
men. It marches reluctantly to the call of
the countries that cry out iu their emptiness
for popuiation. It is mustered by native
contractors at 10 dollars a head, and is herded
on the decks of great steamers in such num-
bers that a sudden sinking at sea wouid
mean an enormous loss of life. It is like a
daily injection of morphia in the veins of
society.
There is no dignity about the labor of
such human merchandise, and where it exists
the white man lets his nails grow long and
learns to despise honest effort, whether he
lives in Vladivostock, where the ice is three
feet thick, or in Pontianak, where the equa-
torial line runs across the Residency veran-
dah. The white man’s original home, as a
matter of fact, is in the tropics, in Java,
where the ape-man first evolved into man.
From thence he has spread all oyer the earth
to the frozen poles, turning black, brown or
tawny, as necessity required. His body has
grown large, or has shrunk as suited its occa-
sions, and his frame has been sustained on
grass, rice, tinned meats, blubber, whisky
and tobacco. He has been scourged with a
hundred diseases and become magnificently
immune from them, and he harbors with im-
punity an army of bacilli in his blood. There
is only one environment to which he cannot
ultimately adapt himself without disaster,
and that is the environment of cheap labor.
As proof of the ability of people of the
white race to remain and breed in the tropics
without noticeable deterioration of physical
and mental characteristics there is the
classic case of the white inhabitants of Iyisar,
in the Dutch East Indies. They ar4 the
descendants of a European garrison which
was lost and forgotten ou this little island,
lying on the route of steamers sroing from
Port Darwin to Singapore. They remained
here, abandoned by the world, from 1767 to
1880, and, under the rule of a native rajah,
they lost all knowledge of the Dutch lan-
guage, and, except for their family names
and a habit of intermarrying, retained no
traces of Euronean civilisation. They were
rediscovered about 40 years ago, and some
of them were removed to other parts of the
super-heated Dutch colony. To-day the
descendants of the original nine families
number over 300. a large nrooort’on of whom
are pure whites, and a scientific observer
recently renorted that, desnite their long
isolation, the effects of malaria and five
generations of intermarrying, of association
with a native race of low culture, and loss
of religion and language, they show no deteri-
oration from the European standard. One
of them is a leading merchant in the Celebes,
another is an official in the Dutch service
in charge of an island, and a third is manag-
ing clerk fir a firm in Delhi. They are good
scholars and industrious workers, and the
fertility of their women is remarkably high,
motherhood at the age of 14 being common.
Because they have lived in these disastrous
tropics like free people, and not like netted
Oriental potentates, they have maintained
for more than a century that European
ability and sturdiness of character which the
merely temporary and between-furloughs
Englishman loses in a 12-month.
FENG-SHUL.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Plight of a Once Great Union.
The task of the employers who call them-
selves the Single Purpose League, and whose
single purpose is to destroy the Australian
system of arbitration, has been made easy
by the A.W.U. executive. Abandoning its
allegiance to arbitration, as it has aban-
doned so much else of the old policy which
made the A.W.U. an inspiration and an
example to Australian unionism, that extra-
ordinary body has declared a strike against
the award of the Commonwealth Arbitration
Court in the shearers’ case. Whether Justice
Powers was right, now that the wool market
has taken: a favorable turn, in fixing lower
rates than have been paid in most parts of
Australia since 1920 —certainly under duress,
in many cases—-is a matter of opinion. He
himself has no doubt on the subject. This
is what he said when about to sign his
award, and his statements and figures have
not been seriously challenged
Under the award every member of the union will
get a living wage, and if the cost of living increases
during an award the basic wage is increased by
the Court. Every very expert shearer who shears
200 sheep a day will receive £3 10s. a day ; every
good shearer who shears 150 a day will receive £2
12s. 6d. a day; slower- shearers who shear 100 a
day will get 355. a day, or £9 12s. 6d. for a week of
days (44 hours a week). Of course if the shearer
travels to many sheds he loses from 7 to 25 per
cent, of time in doing so, but assuming he does so,
are not the rates which give local shearers from
£9 12s. 6d. to £l9 ss. a week fair rates in these
times? The award grants to members every con-
dition of work arid protection granted in previous
awards. It grants to shearers. 44 hours per week,
which was never granted before. It fixes the price
of meat supplied by the pastoralists at less than
the rates agreed to by the union in 1920 and reduces
the amount pastoralists may add to the cost of stores
in other awards. There are several other concessions.
If 30s. a 100 was fair in 1917, 355. is fair now.
If 40s. was fair in July 1920, 355. is fair now.
But whether the Judge should have given
the union a few shillings less or more is
beside the question, as it concerns the public.
The only thing that matters now is that the
controllers of the union have blatantly re-
fused to abide by his decision as to what
should be the legal rates of pay—based, as
always, on the principle that every worker
engaged in the industry must receive a living
wage—after having bound themselves to
accept it. They were in such a hurry to
depart from the constitutional methods
which, under the wise guidance of Spence
and dead Donald Macdonell, made the
A.W.U. the greatest union in Australia,
that the strike was practically in being be-
fore the award was finalised. One of the
union officials had the effrontery to accuse
Justice Powers of the deliberate intention
to bring about an upheaval. To which asper-
sion the President replied :
No falser statement was ever made. Remem-
bering what I do of the shearers’ strike in Queens-
land in 1891, the misery and loss caused to
shearers and the public generally, the ill-will caused,
the bloodshed, prosecutions for conspiracy, and im-
prisonment of good men who were misled by false
promises; remembering the recent strike in South
Africa where there was no compulsory arbitration
system and over 200 men were killed and over 300
wounded and maimed, I would do almost anything
short of making an unjust award to prevent a
shearers’ strike.
Apart from the shattering blow which has
been dealt to a system of which the A.W.U.
was the foremost champion for 15 years, it
is a poor time for an unlawful trial of
strength. The A.W.U. executive is not so
beloved by other and less financial unions
that “sympathy” strikes are likely to occur.
If sheep are shorn at arbitration rates of
wages there will be no rush of transport
organisations to declare the wool “black.”
And the union’s Westralian experience was
unpropitious. It struck in that State last
year for £2 a hundred (the pastoralists
offered 305., and refused to budge), but
there are so many contract shearers about
nowadays and so large a proportion of the
Westralian branch of the union was opposed
to the executive’s mandate, that a ghastly
fiasco resulted. After months of loss and
misery the men who hadn’t worked during
the shearing (many did, the union executive
notwithstanding) went back for 80s. a hun-
dred and anything more (or less) that might
be awarded by Justice Powers in the case
just finished, to which the Westralian Pas-
toralists’ Association and branch of the
A.W.U. were not parties. The union even
agreed to let the squatters hold a portion
of the shearers’ earnings in case the rate to
bq fixed should, be less than 30s. a hundred.
This agreement is one of the hurdles that
will have to be taken bv the Joiinnte-
come-latelys of the A.W.U. —the men who
gave it its great reputation are mostly dead
or expelled—in their blind rush towards “the
revolution.” It looks as if these 0.8. U.
blatherskites and Tammany ballot-riggers
will end by getting a revolution, but not the
one they want. The revolution for which
thev are heading will occur in the A.W.U.

The Humidity that Isn’t.
Dear Bulletin. —I notice in your paper
(25/5/’22) that one G. H. Blakemore is
bathed in gloom about the alleged unfitness
of Tropical Australia for white settlement,
not because of the heat (that bogey is burst),
nor the drought (that bogey blew up), but
by reason of the humidity. He says:—
A high dry-bulb thermometer is not the deterring
factor against the white man and his woman settling
the North. The lion in the path is a high wet-bulb
thermometer, and the grave importance of this indi-
cation of extreme humidity cannot be too strongly
stressed. When the humidity reaches saturation with
a temperature of 70 degrees....
Let me hasten to interpose. There are three
partly-tropical States, and they contain, but
not wholly in their tropical areas, 145,758
square miles of land, with an average rain-
fall of over 40 inches. (N. S. Wales, which
isn’t anywhere near the tropics, has 22.5G6
similar wet-bulb miles: Victoria has 12.000
and Tasmania has 10.101.) Of the tropical
wetness Queensland, the most northern State,
has 95,602 miles, or two-thirds of the lot.
My ,copy of Pugh’s Almanac is onlv for
1921, and it gives Queensland rain figures
only to 1919. In that year there were 25
meteorological stations ii Tropical Queens-
land, and they reported the outrageous and
unhealthy conduct of the wet-bulb thermo-
meter as follows:
Rain in Tropical Queensland.
Hughenden .. 7.14 in. Townsville .. 21.33 in.
Charters Towers 10.11,, Herberton .. 21.60,,
Clermont ~ 10.89,, Muttaburra .. 22. ~
NebO . . .’. 11:92 „ Bowen . . . . 23.42 ~

Gilbert River .. 17.43,, Cairns .. .'. 57.50 ~
Ayr .... 20.20 „ Innisfail .. 102.21 „
Rockhampton.. 20.54 „
I respectfully submit that the wet-bulb ther-
mometer, if it is going to make such trouble,
should be composed of sterner stuff, and that,
if the awesome “humidity” of Tropical Aus-
tralia is the new weapon in the arsenal of.
those who want a Black North, it requires
a fresh edge and point and handle. Eleven
of these tropical stations w T ere drier in 1919
than the driest temperate or cold-weather
capital, their figures being as follows—
Rain in Cold Climate .Capitals (1919).

It is inevitable that some people, dropping
in at Innisfail, Cairns, Port Douglas or
Darwin, should generalise too hastily and
assume that all Tropical Australia is a hot,
soggy sponge. I did something of the sort
myself in young days, when, seeing ice in
the North Atlantic, I opined that the people
of France and Spain must be having a
dreadful time. Perhaps Mr. Blakemore
will make a fuss and say that 1919 was a
dry year. It was—all over Australia. I
personally arranged a dry year in advance
for his benefit, as I foresaw that he, or some-
body so like him that he would resemble
him more than he resembles himself, was
approaching. But a real wet-bulb country
should be above dry years.—Yours, etc.,

Preference for Criminals.
One of the employees of the Bowral
(N.S.W.) Council, a man named John
Bateson Goodworth, recently became
annoyed with a young horse. A local con-
stable described the result: —
He found the animal’s left eye cut in halves, the
hindquarters cut about as if barbed wire had been
used for breeching, the intestines ruptured, and there
was a lump under the stomach about half the size
of a football. The horse was also bleeding from the
nose, mouth, hindquarters, and all. over the body..
There were dozens of whip marks and cuts on it,
and it had been attacked by blowflies. When the
horse fell down Goodworth and a friend sat on it
and smoked cigarettes. They then took the horse
two and a half miles along the Berrima-road, where
it was left without food, water or care for two days
and nights.
The Bowral magistrate, in sentencing Good-
worth to a month’s hard labor, expressed
abhorrence -of his conduct, and “regretted
that he could not make the punishment
heavier.” Incidentally, under the law by
virtue of which this unique blackguard was
lined up (the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals Act, 1901) the penalty might have
been made just three times heavier. But
there is no reason to doubt the magistrate's
good faith; his law and not his heart was at
fault. It might be expected that the coun-
cillors, on learning what a revolting character
they have been harboring, would take an
early opportunity to hand his job to another
—say, to one of the thousands of Diggers of
good repute, who are on the bread-line to-day
chiefly because they fought seven or eight
years ago to make the world safe for places
like Bowral. To imagine a vain thing of
that nature, however, is to misunderstand
the mentality of the up-country Bumble, and
to overlook the value of a “pull” in a small
locality where few are in a position to throw
stones lest in the rebound many may be
injured. Shortly after Goodworth was led
away to begin his richly-earned sentence it
was unanimously recommended by a commit-
tee of the whole council: —
(1) That a temporary hand be engaged for six
weeks to do Mr. Goodwortii’s work.
(2) That Mr. Goodworth be granted four weeks’
leave of absence.
A body of councillors who can sanc-
tion the presence in the district of a
malefactor of this type (one who is as
likely, eventually, to address himself to the
mutilation of women or children as to the
blinding or disembowelling of horses) must
be as dead to the sentiments that actuate
normal Australians as those council em-
ployees who are content to work beside such a
disgrace to humanity. But what of the rate-
payers of this wealthy and reputedly enlight-
ened district? Have they no objection to the
spectacle of their money being spent on the
encouragement of offences such as that of
Avhich “Mr.” Goodworth was convicted? If
they do object—if their standard as regards
humanitarianism is no better even than that
of the average Chinese in our midst—then
they will take the preliminary step to shifting
some of the stain which has been put on
Bowral by doing their best to shift all those
councillors who have revealed themselves as
sympathisers with Goodworth.

The Law and the Chosen.
“Gray’S Inn” : It is remarkable how names
like Isaacs, Fink, Cohen, Lazarus, Davies,
SoNENBERG, HERMAN, WOOLF, BARNETT and
so on crop up in the legal annals of Vic-
toria. These figure almost every day in
the papers; how many representatives of
their race are practising under other names
or guises it is hard to say. The [Hebrew
always disliked manual labor, and fancied
himself as a chatterer. It is long since he
had a country to light for with his hands,
but he has been fighting with his tongue for
himself and his people through ages. And
most of the time he has been on the defen-
sive. While the Gentile was knocking him
from pillar to post throughout Europe ho
acquired a dislike for authority and an apti-
tude for evading it. He saw what things
could be done and were being done in the
name of the Law; his adaptable mind took
in the weaknesses of every . case brought
against him, and so through many tribula-
tions he has developed into about the most
capable legal point-taker there is to-day. It
is more than a coincidence that an Isaacs
should have been Lord Chief Justice in Eng-
land while another Isaacs was a High
Court Judge in Australia. Nor is it sur-
prising that there should be a Cohen, K.C.,
in Victoria and a Judge Coiien in N. S.
Wales —which has a Levy (also a lawyer)
for a Speaker, and which had in Mr. Justice
Cohen and Salomons, K.C., two particu-
larly bright ornaments of the Supreme Court
Bench and Inner Bar respectively. The edu-
cated person of this lineage, given any sort
of opportunity, is bound to go a long way.
He may have a few prejudices to contend
against, but he is used to that, and he is
rarely hampered by class traditions and
shibboleths, such as make it “bad form’’ to
haggle, and “not the thing” to associate
with this or that seedy individual. For' a
long while the Law was the preserve of the
well-born or the well-to-do, and the Israelite
was kept outside the pale. Now that the
doors are open he.has not only got in, but is
strongly entrenched there. The divergence,
culturally and otherwise, between Jew and
Jew is remarkable, as in the case of all down-
trodden peoples. There is the Justice
Isaacs type—learned, forceful and abound-
ing in charm. There is also the type that
is to be met occasionally in the police courts.
He is effusively, greasily polite to the Bench,
but aggressively unpleasant to the down-at-
ejbows witness on the other side. He is
not scrupulous in method, and be is
generally bitter and abusive in attack. Need-
less to say. he has his prototypes amongst
so-called Christian advocates. But the
bullying of the low : class Jew is always a
shade or two more truculent, and his fawn-
ing a little more offensive. The Israelite
who is doing well —arid the majority of them
are doing well —is ne’ver like that. He is
urbane as well as quick-witted, humorous as
well as impressive, and kindly at heart as
well as keen in business. The world of
crookdom looks to him as a tower of refuge,
and it isn’t often disappointed. It doesn’t
as a rule get something for nothing, but.
even that miracle has happened. Take him
for all in all, the Jew lawyer, with the inevi-
table exceptmns noted, is a gentleman first
and a Jew afterwards.
When the Baptist Fleet Puts to Sea.
Dear Bulletin, — I am no sectarian —in
fact, beyond a profound faith in the South-
to-North railway, in White Australia and
in the creation of small States I am singu-
larly unencumbered with theological luggage.
Still I hope to live to see such items as
the following become as common as the
hackneyed statement about the finding of
the body, and the police having a clue or
some glue or Something:—
The tension in spiritual circles has become acute,
and the main Baptist fleet has put to sea. Its
destination is unknown but is strongly suspected.
A strong Methodist squadron is reported in the
Channel.
Six Hebrew ironclads under Admiral d’MosES are
at anchor in the Dead Sea, and early action is ex-
pected.

generally subdivides in races and sects. Then
either the tribes or the sects or both start
a row. The Jew is lucky inasmuch as lii9
tribe and his sect are one, but other folk
strike me as too much cut up, both length-
wise and crosswise. The present situation
in Southern Ireland is that, as soon as the
political war came to some sort of a settle-
ment, the religious war really began, and it
promises, as is very common, to be the more
venomous of the pair. In fact, I begin to
think that, among people who take spiritual
matters seriously, and with high explosives,
creed is a more virulent emotion than
nationality. Therefore 1 would suggest
that the best should be made of a bad job, and
that the sects (white sects only) should be
armed instead of the States, in the hope that
the tribal feeling may diminish, and
leave more space, and make one trouble the
less, and in the further hope that the Baptist
fleet will put to sea early, and make history
of one sort or another. I don’t care
whether it is licked or otherwise. The big
husky creeds would allot themselves separate
countries, and the Methodist who insisted on
living in an Anglican country would simply
be a permanent alien, living under the pro-
tection of the Methodist ambassador. The
sects that were too small to have a country
would have no ambassador and would be
aliens everywhere, in consequence of which
they would give up being sects and petty sec-
tarian nuisances, and join up somewhere.
Nobody would found a new church, like
Bishop Eggbeater and his friends, who
have so shaken up Theosophical circles in
Australia, because success would mean the
loss of his vote and his J.P.-ship, and that
he would be disqualified for sitting in Par-
liament or taking up a 040-acre selection.
And he couldn’t get followers for the same
reason. Every adult would need to have a reli-
gion of some sort in order to be a citizen. At
the same time no one would have more than
one religion at a time, it being impossible to
be a citizen and an alien simultaneously. In
this connection I have always found a streak
of pathos in the case of Solomon Davidson.
who reigned at Jerusalem, and seems, by a
passage in the Ist Book of Kings, to have
had all the existing religions on the same
day. And at the miserable finish he had
none at all, and in one of his contributions
to that well-known publication, the Bible, he
declared officially that there is no hereafter,
and not much of anything else: —
For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth
beasts; even one thing befalleth them; as the one
dieth so dieth the other; yea, they have all one
breath ; so that a man has no pre-eminence above a
beast; for all is vanity. —Ecclesiastes in, 19.
He was evidently a. tired old man of many
semi-colons, and life, for him, had become a
fizzle. Reverting to the original subject, I
suppose that some will say the scheme I
have outlined savors of persecution. Though
I regard it merely as a matter of tidiness, I
don’t care much what it is called. But it
seems to me that in the past many promis-
ing persecutions have gone to the dogs
through the attempt to run the tribal and
spiritual aspects of things together.—Yours,
etc., Henry llorsecollar.

The N. S. Wales Orchestra.
Unless the N. S. Wales Government
can be induced to change its mind
before next September the State Orches-
tra will form another victim of that con-
tempt for any form of culture which char-
acterises most of our politicians. Verbrug-
ghen has succeeded signally where Marshall
1 Tall, 20 years ago in Melbourne, utterly
failed. It is immaterial whether the credit
goes to the improved mentality of the public
or to the superior gifts of the Belgian musi-
cian. The point is that the orchestra is
here, and vitally here, and that it will give
the country an extremely bad advertisement
if it is allowed to lapse. The Common-
wealth’s musieianly spirit cannot be vindi-
cated by the possession of Melba’s birth-
place. The ordinary taxpayer, on reading
o'er his morning marmalade that the orches-
tra is faced with a deficit of £ll,OOO, swal-
lows hard and says; “This is a bit too much:
taxes are bad enough without this,” and
decides- that the best thing to do is to get
rid of so costly a luxury. And it is in this
unfortunately widespread tendency that the
political Podsnap gets his chance. He can
understand the multiplication of depart-
ments and officials (they mean jobs, which
mean votes), and he can argue with con-
vincing passion for the intention of State
Governors, who, while fulfilling no useful func-
tion, add pleasantly to the pomp and circum-
stance of the politician’s job. But an orchestra
is worth few, if any, votes, and a defence of
if. either in or out of the House, cannot
be pointed at as a proof of Empire loyalty
or detestation of the Vatican. So, in the
politician’s eyes, it is an over-costly super-
fluity and an institution to be reprobated.
And yet such an orchestra as that which
Verbruggtien has created for N. S. Wales
is probably worth more, as a mere commer-
cial asset overseas, than a High Commis-
sioner, for it is a standing proof of this coun-
try’s cultural, and, therefore, political de-
velopment. It is wrong that the burden of
supporting such an institution slionld fall
on the shoulders of private individuals. It
is a State matter, like any other form of
education. And the money expended on it
now must sow the seeds of an infinite amount
of artistic understanding at home and high
repute abroad —which, incidentally, repre-
sent profit—in the by no means distant
future.

The Food thaf Australin Isn’t

\ s lt something in *he balmy Australian air
1,31 causes its politicians to pilSe with a fat
complacency which should incite any lntelli-
gent audience to derision, if not anger : The
d uei ’y 18 inspired by the fact that these gems
recently collected by the press up at

t,les 01 the world * and spoke ot the need tor the

that it is now “the greatest food-producing

INDUSTRY : “Oh, dear, this suspense is killing me.”
country in the world” is apparently meant
as a tribute to his methods. The Federal
Statistician, however, furnishes long lists of
countries and their produce, especially in the
food line, with interesting results. Austra-
lia, in the last volume, is ninth.on the list as
a beef-raiser (between'Britain and France),
fourteenth for wheat, eighteenth for oats,
eighteenth for maize, twenty-fourth for bar-
ley, and nowhere in the known world for
any other food except mutton. This coun-
try leads the world in wool, but isn’t quite
■so far ahead in sheep-meat, for our merino
isn’t of the elephantine class. The potato
should be easy to rear, but in the five years
1916-20 Australia imported more “spuds”
than it exported to the value of £48,813.
It is necessary to go to the “Statesman’s
Year Book” for sugar statistics. That
volume puts: this great continent nineteenth
among the world’s growers and behind even
Belgium. Australia spent almost £1,000,000
in 1920 on imported fish. It supplies about
1 per cent, of its own needs in cotton and
tobacco (a dyipg industry), and, despite
all its vineyards it spends about £1,000,000
a year more for imported drinks than it
receives for exports. It is difficult to guess
why W. M. Hughes, after saying that Aus-
tralia, with its small population, has worked
so tremendously as to become the world’s
greatest food-producer, should recommend more
work as a remedy for the problems ahead.
Meanwhile the situation has moved the plain-
spoken Nobthcliffe to state in England
that our “nominated and selected” immi-
grants are drifting back in disgust, and that
every man who goes back to his native ham-
let saying that Australia is an ill-managed
fraud makes it harder to catch the next
man. In 1920 (the 1921 figures are not
available yet) the Commonwealth received
97,563 persons and sent away 89,761 —credit
balance, 7502. But as it paid for 9U59
immigrants, it appears that a big crowd left
in a rage. Probably they found the one
or two monster towns too like London, and
(he decaying small ones too like Stoke-
Pogis-on-the-llike which they had left, but
with less of a perceptible future. A remedy
is wanted for this dry rot aud national death-
in-life, not a wild denial that it exists, and
our cavorting Welsh gramophone receives a
large salary to provide that remedy.
Fools’ Paradises.
“The Japanese are the Germans of the East. They
are perpetually spreading propaganda, emigrating
and spying all over the world. They have most
covetous eyes on Australia and M.L.; they are a
real danger."— Lord Northcliffe.
A common type of Tory paper in Australia
is as pained at such unmannerly candor as
any I.W.W. pacifist, though the objection is
lodged in different terms. Take Sydney
Telegraph’s comment:—
Australia does not share Lord Northcliffe's dis-
trust of Japan. On this subject we have cast out
fear. Japan is a loyal adherent to the terms of the
Washington Treaty, and an unquestionable subscriber
to Lloyd George's non-aggression pact. Why should
Lord Northcliffe suspect Japan of unfaith?”
Substitute “Germany” for “Japan” and we
get the precise reproach that Lord Roberts
drew upon himself in the years before the
war, when he was fighting almost lone-
handed to awaken England to the Prussian
menace. Before Roberts began his cam-
paign many Australian papers, of which the
Telegraph was a conspicuous example, de-
rided the R.A.N., and actually opposed its
formation on the ground that a local fleet
was an insult to the British Navy—-though
the Imperial Government, so far from frown-
ing on the scheme, had warmly approved it.
It was a shoddy sort of loyalty, this attempt
to represent the Imperial connection as all-
sufficient for Australia’s safety. And there
is nothing unpatriotic in resolutely remem-
bering that even the Imperial connection will
only remain a shield for Australia against
possible enemies as long as Great Britain
is able as well as willing to defend the
Dominions. A genuine Little England Cab-
inet might disclose a Britain _ which had
grown tired, if only momentarily tired, oi
being taxed to keen Australia secure ; and a
revolution or even a general strike _ might
find our protector too preoccupied in the
business of self-preservation to attend to
the troubles of others. The position is that
we live nationally by grace of Britain’s
alreadv somewhat questionable mastery of
the sea : and that we may depend shortly on
that harassed and debt-burdened country s
mastery of the air as well. Pending the
loss of either or both Japan will, of course,
be friendly to the nation which it can least
afford to 'offend. With Britain in difficul-
ties this undefended land of ours would be
automatically taken over by the Japanese.
That is no 'reflection on our neighbors: it
is simply business, as the thing has been
understood since nationalism began.
*
A Staff-officer holds forth: —
Much hypocritical nonsense is talked (and written)
about the difference* in behavior of different races
and even regiments in warfare. Lately Colonel
Lenehan’s death revived memories of the execution
of Moiu nt and Handcock in the Boer war, and I
was asked for a decision as to whether Australian
troops had ever shot prisoners. Uproar ensued when
I replied that the best troops of all nations had done
so. Luckily I was able to point at once to page
338 of Vol. 1 of Bean's “Official History,” where
the following appears:—
As the Australians got in among them, the
Turks threw their rifles, but they were too many
to capture and were consequently shot.
This occurred on MacLagan’s Ridge early on the
morning of the Landing. In fact, it was the first
time Australians and Turks had met hand-to-hand.
The shooting was in the circumstances a military
necessity, but many Jackos hidden in the scrub
were spectators, and it should not be a matter for
surprise that Abdul was told the Anzacs took no
prisoners, or that only four survived of all the Aus-
tralians who fell into Turkish hands on the Peninsula.
But in case it should be contended that “English
troops would not do such a thing” I refer the contender
to Stephen Graham’s “A Private in the Guards.”
There it is related how after an action a sergeant
asked his officer for permission to shoot the 20-odd
prisoners, giving as his reason that he wanted
to avenge his brother who had been killed in cold
blood. Leave v'as granted and the prisoners shot.
This was in the Grenadiers. The lulling here would
appear inexcusable, as the heat of action had passed,
the motive being the same revenge or reprisal for
which Morant and Handcock paid with their lives.
Of course the further particulars which Graham
does not give might make the deed look a little
less black. It should be remembered that
many of our national heroes, Cceur ue Lion,
Edward 111. and Henry V., for example, who showed
the most chivalrous courtesy to their prisoners on
some occasions, massacred captives in cold blood
at other times. Napoleon, as a military necessity,
poisoned his own wounded.
The Sydney Town-planning Association
turned up the other day with a scheme to re-
construct Pitt and George streets, Sydney,
in part, and King and Park streets in a
large general way, and wfith “many other
proposals.” A brighter crowd would put the
gigantic lever of its intellect behind a scheme
for getting railways from the interior to such
places as Twofold Bay, Jervis Bay (from
Goulburn) and Coff’s Harbor, so as to make
jobs for itself at making nice, pretty, new
towns, instead of town-cobbling the same old
proposition by word of mouth. While these
new cities were filling up the growth, conges-
tion and slumificatio.n of the Big Place might
be arrested for 20 years, and it might even
lose some of the slummers it has—say 150,000
or so. In that blessed interval of Sabbath
calm, when the shriek of the suburban-allot-
ment shark was stilled, and the space he
now occupies in the press was devoted to the
reports of improving theological discourses
(now, alas! crowded out). Sydney could be
reconstructed as the City Beautiful, the
slump in land values and the deserted state
of many tenements all facilitating the work.
Then in about 1945 it could resume its proud
march towards the million-population mark
as the youngest, newest, brightest metropolis
in the Pacific, instead of being a painted
and patched and prematurely aged and
deboshed-looking harridan. A ship is docked
for reconstruction; no one can do the work
with satisfaction when it is full of passen-
gers and cargo and breaking a record. Syd-
ney also wants to be docked. When mean
streets have a family in each room and two
on the balcony, and new people are arriving
at the rate of many thousands per annum,
and new dwellings are not being built, and
the old ones already spread out a quarter-
day’s journey from the hub of things, very
little is possible. The first essential is to
find a placfl in which to put a lot of people,
and thus secure a lucid interval. If The
Bulletin was a Town-Botching Association
it would do its best to make a start at that
e.nd of the business. Meanwhile the veil of
shabbiness and greyness and dull-brownness
spreads further and further out, and no
Town-Mender shows the slightest sign of
\overtaking it. A Town-Greyhound would
hardly be fast enough.

POLITICAL
POINTS
“Gallery”: Vic. Premier Lawson stated in
Melbourne last week that he has no inten-
tion of leaving State politics “at present” ;
in fact, he “hasn’t given the-Federal sphere
a thought.” Despite this emphatic assertion
1 make bold to repeat my belief that, if
Hughes deserts Bendigo for a more congenial
constituency—and he is now looking round
for the same—Lawson will have a shot
for the vacancy. Of course, he would
not loudly offer himself. He would,
be “persuaded” by influential supporters
and would put up a great show of
resigning his Premiership with heart-broken
reluctance ; but he would probably drop his
job with great relief.
When the N. S. Wales Nationalists were
in opposition they promised not to reduce
civil-service salaries. Now that they are in
office they, are reducing the said salaries as
hard as they can. But seemingly the vic-
tims don’t mind. At a meeting sum-
moned by the Public Service Association,
which has thousands of members, to discuss
the reduction of 7s. a week in the basic
wage, there were not enough Bolshies pre-
sent to make a quorum—2s. The only
tumult occurred when the president an-
nounced the adjournment of the proceedings,
and the meeting stormed away to see Mary
Pickaxe at the Flyceum.
About 17 shindies are raging at once in
the Speck Labor party, which faces the
electors on June 10. Recently the A.L.P.
executive announced that its only active
divisional organisation (Denison) was
bogus, and took the conduct of the election
campaign unto itself. Then Dicker and
Keogh, who announced themselves as Inde-
pendent Labor candidates for Franklin,
were declared bogus and expelled. Some of
the endorsed Labor candidates, led by
Ogden, call themselves “moderates” and
opposed to O. B. U’isrn. Another section
also says it is “moderate” because it stands
for the 0.8. U. preamble. This section is
working a boycott of the Labor paper, but
for other than political reasons. Meanwhile,
the prospect of reducing Premier Lee’s majo-
rity, which is all that the most ardent
Laborite now hopes for, is daily receding
towards the South Pole.
“Stony”: The sword of Boydocles hangs
over F. 11. Francis, M.H.R. for Ilenty
(Vic.). Francis entered the House of Reps,
as a drab, retiring, father Inimble person
with no obvious advantages either of speech
or manner. His term in Parliament has
turned him into a somewhat pompous citi-
zen, given to “dressing the part” and dis-
cussing weighty matters of State with com-
plete self-assurance, particularly at church
tea-meetings and bazaar-openings. Now, it
is prophesied, even by those who don’t like
Boyd, that if that burly and flamboyant citi-
zen tries again for his old seat, the num-
bers will be in his favor, as they were in
1913, T 4 and T 7.
Vain are the efforts of Hughes’s press
worshippers to present him as an inoffensive
citizen who would never attempt a dictator-
ship over his colleagues. The other day a
Melbourne paper got off something to this
effect, and the statement had hardly been
published before Hughes was discovered over-
riding Foster, Minister of Works, in the
matter of the lmstel at Canberra. Last
session Hughes had promised the precious
refuge to the Dryberra faction, and Foster
was eager to go ahead, but the little auto-
crat had changed his mind in the meantime
and declared that .nothing was to be done
until he returned to Melbourne from Queens-
land. Foster is now trying to bottle up
his amazement and chagrin, but a little of his
emotion has been turned into print, to the
deep pain of those people who have been
boosting Hughes’s modesty i,n his relations
with his Cabinet. An interesting side-issue
is that, though the Priminister’s promise of
the hostel is recalled by several members of
the Reps., no record on the matter is con-
tained in Hansard. However, as members
are allowed to correct the “proofs” of their
speeches, the assumption is that Billy’s refer-
ence to the hostel “inadvertently” dropped
out.
If the shearers’ strike, which began last
week, results in a win, or anything like one,
for those who are defying arbitration, the
likeliest result of importance will be the
extinction of the professional sheep-barber
STRICTLY NON-COMMITTAL.
“But how about the North-South line, “Does Immigration soon begin,
New States, Defence and such?” And what of Willie Watt?”
“The view is fine,” the walrus said,
“Do you admire it much?”
altogether. A matter of Othello finding his
occupation gone. The tendency already is
towards small flocks, each farmer cutting his
own sheep-hair or co-operating in the cere-
mony with a few neighbors. The great-
sheep State Is N. S. Wales. In 1891 it
had 72 flocks of 100,000 and over. In 1920
it had one (122,940 sheep), and that has
presumably died since. Flocks of over
50,000 dropped in the same period from 259
to 12. The little agriculturist has been a
frost, but the little sheep-man, who can tell
the A.W.U. to run away and play, bids fail-
soon to have the field to himself.
Possibly from a desire to demonstrate that
progress wasn’t wholly dead, the Dooley
(N.S.W.) Government, just before it passed
away, opened the railway line to Bombala—
a 32-miles extension of the Goulburn-Nim-
mitabel railway, which began its career of
insolvency at the Goulburn end 38 years ago,
and hasn’t onoe let up on it since. So Bom-
bala got one string of antiquated rolling-stock
daily from the hamlet with the Babylonian
name, instead of a motor-’bus. Bombala is
one of the 49 dying municipalities that the
census-catcher discovered in N. S. Wales on
3/4/’2l, and it is smaller now than it was
30 years ago. Cooma, alongside, is dying
also. The new line stopped 00 miles short
of the fine port of Twofold Bay, and it is
meant to stop short till Judgment Day,
because it is held that Sydney (320 miles
away) should have whatever local trade
there is. Eden, on Twofold Bay, is also
dying: in fact, nearly everything is dying
thereabouts except the dead. After a brief
experience of one old train per day, Bombala
lately received, notice of reduction to three
older trains per week, because the failure is
worse than usual From that to one doddering
train per week is but a steo; and the transi-
tion stage to th.e old bullock-dray method of
traction will then be easy. It is all very
tynical of the way city-bossed Governments
help the Backblocks to go forward and
perish.
A weird bunch of nonentities have an-
nounced themselves as candidates for Haw-
thorn (Vic.) State seat, should McPherson
go to the Reps., and the electors are getting
alarmed. They have not forgotten what
an awful falling-off occurred when Burbour
succeeded Murray Smith in 1900-1902. After
Barbour came Swinburne and McPherson,
who won front rank. The desperate ex-
pedient now suggested in the electorate is
that Swinburne should drop his candidature
for the Senate, capture the Hawthorn
Assembly seat (which was formerly his),
join the Lawson Cabinet as Minister for
Agriculture and Water Supply (portfolios
lie held in the Bent Government), and
secure the reversion of the Premiership if
Lawson enters Federal politics.
Vic. Council will have four new mem-
bers as a result of the elections, 14 of
the retiring ones having been sent back.
Portly Dick Abbott, who now belongs to the
Cocky. party, is back in the House after an
absence of nine years. For him the plush
benches will be a slight, very slight, improve-
ment oh the dreariness of Bendigo City
Council. - Williams, a South Melb. Laborite,
outed ex-Gaud Mayor Aikman for Melb.
West. Six years ago he went down before
another Laborite. Aikman found a flaw in
the propputy qualification of his opponent,
and wrested the Seat from him on appeal.
But Williams’s landed title is declared to be
unassailable.
The apostles of the new order are gaining
disciples in Queensland. It is part of then-
gospel that there is no shame in taking Gov-
ernment rations, inasmuch as the State
owes every man a job, and, failing that,
tucker. “It is your birthright as a free-
born comrade,” screams the A.W.U. organ-
iser or Labor M.L.A., “and the cost is borne
by the capitalist, who pays the taxes.” Hence
this kind of thing is becoming common:—
In the Townsville Police Court Henry Thomas
Connor was fined £5 for drawing rations
for himself and dependants while he was earning
17s. 4d. per day in steady employment. He .vas
also ordered to refund £ll Bs., the value of the
rations obtained.
Premier Theodore admits that 17 per cent,
of those who obtain free rations are single
men. Rut they all have votes, and the Gov-
ernment’s need of votes is so desperate that
it can’t afford to discriminate. So the
sponger is having the time of his life.
“Saluting the Flag” started, or was to
have done so, the other day in schools all
over the afflicted Ma State. Because grown-
up Smith (possibly Schmidt from Ger-
many) preaches crime in the park on Sun-
day, Jones’s child has to make a strange
noise and a curious gesticulation on Mon-
day, he being smaller than Schmidt and more
accessible. Meanwhile Schmidt goes on
Schinidting as usual. And to top off the
joke many of the loudest blitherers, lay and
clerical, on behalf of the fool practice have
names very like Schmidt themselves.
The Theodore Government has nominated
MacDonald, editor of Brisbane Standard.
for the vacant seat in the Senate. Which
is another indication of the malady that
worries the Government. There are a dozen
Labor M’s.L.A. who would have jumped at
the thing had it been offered them. But
that would have involved the danger of
Theodore’s losing his majority, and he was
afraid to risk it.
One of the things Jackson, M.H.R. for
Bass (Tas.), brought back from the
Northern Territory, along with an unshak-
able belief in the North-South railway and
in the suitability of Centralia and the Terri-
tory for white settlement, was a photograph
of a Government boring party. The man
in charge of the outfit was a Jap. “And I
was told up there,” said Jackson, at a meet-
ing in aid of the Presbyterian Inland Mis-
sion, “that the Japs know more about arte-
sian water in the Territory than our own
people,” which is more than probable.
If the agents of Nippon were as ignorant of
the Territory as Hughes and Pearce, who
have been running it for 10 years on a system
which combines the wildest notions of Henry
George with the maddest performances of
the Circumlocution Office, it would be a
miracle.
Bruce, the Commonwealth Treasurer, was
in Adelaide the other day on his first official
visit. He arrived for . a crowded League of
Nations’ meeting, was requisitioned for a
University gathering, and grasped the skirts
of opportunity in each case. Having made
an agreeable impression with his thoughtful
and well-phrased speeches, the young ma’’
didn’t give it time to dissipate, but fled
back to. Melbourne. It was supposed on
his arrival that the object of his visit was
to bring together the warring Liberals and
Nationalists. Bruce denied that he had any
such express mission, but admitted that it
would be very unfriendly of him not to put
in a good word on the subject, if requested.
And requested he was.
Considering that every farmer has a vote
for Westralia’s Leg. Council, the Country
party shaped unpromisingly at the late elec-
tions. Certainly no seats were wrested from
it, but its candidates were beaten in two
divisions it had made certain of winning—
one in the Federal constituency of Prowse
(Swan) and the other in that of Gregory
(Dampier). In a third province, and that
the very birthplace of the Agrarian move-
ment (it is also part of Gregory’s electorate)
an Independent polled 1208 votes against:
the selected man’s 1637. These are unmis-
takable signs of reaction against Cocky-in-
politics, and the Perth executive will be in
no hurry to take extreme measures against
the man from Dampier, to whose electorate
some solid Nationalist subdivisions are in
process of being added. Although Gregor >
resigned the deputy-leadership at the end of
last session, he hasn’t been requested to
leave the party, a distinction which, accord-
ing to lobby chatter, was paid to Alec Hay.
Among the Nationalist candidates for
Denison (T.) State election is Major L. H.
Payne. He is a son of the Tas. Senator,
whose most important remark during the
tariff debate was a declaration that he had
counted several boxes of Australian-made
matches and found that each box contained
only about 50-odd lucifers as against the
regulation GO supplied in the imported
article. But Payne fils proved himself quite
an efficient soldier when abroad with the
40th Batt.. and if he gets into the Speck
Assembly he is not likely to worry about
the number of pins in a packet or of
matches in a box o’ lights.
THE WRONG QUEST.

“The day’ is fine,” the Diva said. ‘‘All Nature now

It may be so. It sounds all right—to green young

Eight years ago paid capital was millions,
and though I*} million more has since been
called in, the business of the Common-
wealth’s biggest proprietary bank has grown
so rapidly that invitations are out for share-
holders to put in another million. This new
capital will make the Wales stronger from
the point of view of relation of funds to
liabilities than it has been mr very many
years. Just prior to the war it was holding
£7 of the public’s money for every £1 of its
own funds; at one period during the war the
proportion slightly exceeded the £8 which is
regarded as a fair limit in Australian bank-
ing. Twelve months ago new capital and accu-
mulated profits reduced the proportion to £7
11s., and a shrinkage of liabilities has since
effected a reduction to £6 18s: Bd. The new
million will reduce it to £t> 4s. 6d. with lia-
bilities at present level, and thus enable the
management to extend operations whenever
opportunity offers without incurring any
strain on the bank’s resources. In view of
the sound trading position disclosed by the
latest accounts, the directors’ reasons for
getting in another million are not altogether
clear; but probably their faith in the future
of the Commonwealth, when it recovers from
the present partial depression, has prompted
them to prepare the bank for its full part
in the activities of the innumerable new
industries which are developing.
Meantime the bank continues to do so well
that it can offer good prospects of a continu-
ance of 10 p.c. divs. on the increased capital.
Recent disclosed profits have been far in
excess of the £300,000 per half-year which
that rate of div. will in future demand. And
it is most unlikely that during the abnormal
years the Wales’s disclosed profits have
represented anything like its full net earn-
ings. The Bulletin has shown on several
occasions how a much greater proportion of
bank assets is revenue-earning compared
with pre-war days—that interest, both in
investments and advances, has improved, and
that charges generally have been increased.
The additional administration expenses have,
of course, increased the outgo; but, consider-
ing how conditions have favored the big
banks, it is hard to believe that the Wales’s
funds are earning less than they were in
1910 and just pi-ior to the war. Yet that
is what the accounts claim :
Disclosed Profits p.c. of Funds.
1910.. 8.3 p.c. I 1919.. 7.7 p.c. I 1921.. 9.5 p.c.
1914.. 9.1 „ I 1920.. 7.3 „ [ 1922.. 8.2 „
Even in the March, 1921, term, when, as a
result of the exchange tangle, abnormal
profits resulted, the bit extra disclosed
to pay a bonus to shareholders lifted the dis-
closed eai-nings very little above pre-war
performances. The management has had
exceptional opportunities of providing for
any troubles which might have resulted from
the unusual conditions; not that the Wales
is likely to have needed much strengthen-
ing, for nothing but a national disaster
could shake it. It was one of the very few
which came through the storm of 30 years
ago practically unscathed. Its development
since those unsettled days has been very
rapid: in 1890 18 millions-odd of deposits
were held; five vears later, when the storm
had abated, it held 111 millions ; by 1900 211
millions; just prior to the war, more than
30-) millions. To-day it is' entrusted with
50j millions —not all additional “wealth”
which is at rest in its care, for the present
large figures are to some extent due to the
disordered state of the national balance-sheet
as a result of the war. Nevertheless, the
paper currency—there is now about
£32,000,000 of Australian notes in circula-
tion in excess of the gold backing, compared
with loss than 21 millions of paper which
the banks themselves had in circulation be-
fore the Commonwealth created a monopoly
of flimsies —and the lOU’s with which the
Commonwealth Government financed the
greater part of war expenditure have both
helped the business of the dealers in money,
and, in turn, their profits.
In addition to war-finance influences, bank
balance-sheets have in recent years been
affected by unusual trading conditions. The
Wales, however, felt the strain less than
most, and though advances were £8,400,000
larger at the height of the importing boom
than a year previously, its customary
liouid strength was well maintained. Dur-
ing the past 12 months there have been
shrinkages in all grouped figures, as shown
by this comparison :

Trading conditions are now practically back
to normal, and though many traders were
badly hit by the slump of prices last year,
disclosed banking profits have not suffered.
Some heavy losses have been incurred, of
course, but in all instances inner reserves have
filled the holes, and there has been no public
admission of bad accounts. The new capital
now being got in will, no doubt, influence
the liquid position, which is now very strong.
Apart from the wheat pool, war gratuity
and War Goan advances, which could fairly
be regarded as liquid, cash assets at March 31
represented slightly more than 10s. in the £
of all liabilities. Including the £2,955,134
of Government-guaranteed advances as liquid
- —and, in the event of trouble, they would
presumably be almost as good as the
£7,906,000 of Government and municipal
securities—the Wales had 33| ' millions of
its OOj millions of liabilities to the public
in notes, cash or gilt-edged paper, leaving
27 millions of the public’s money to be
covered by 35 millions-odd of advances (as
written down to provide for contingencies!

The Co-operative Wool and Produce has now
been in business 25 years, and has lately
shown considerable activity in extending its
interests. Having developed a big wool con-
nection, a couple of years ago the manage-
ment decided to build up its live-stock
and stud-stock business. Maiden Bros.’
old business was acquired, and during the
12 months to March 31 the Co-op. handled
350,180 sheep at Flemington—the largest
turnover by any agent—did a good trade
in cattle and pigs, and also considerably
strengthened its position in the stud-stock
market. The co. is now doing a larger busi-
ness than formerly in other pastoral pro-
ducts, and is developing its station-supn y
department. It has also become an agent
for the Pacific Insurance Co. Lately
the management also endeavored to secure
a firmer hold of the wool trade by making
an offer for the P.F.A. when that concern
collapsed after the fire which destroyed its
partially-insured belongings; but a competi-
tor got in ahead of it. To assist the expan-
sion of the business the directors a year ago
offered 45.000 8 p.c. prefs. of £1 each, and
as an inducement to subscribers the shares
were offered as paid to ss. The old ordi-
naries took up 36.843 of these shares, and
10s. per share has been called up. During
the year £1633 of ordinaries were placed,
and paid capital has increased from £45.000
to £72,205, £9210 of the increase being
transferred reserves.
Latest profits, prior to paying a staff
bonus of £1227, were the best for a dozen
years. But the period was not normal: after
selling 68,383 bales (61,542 were received
during the year), at the balance 15,664 bales
were still on hand. The worst of the wool-
trade troubles appear to have passed, and
there are bright prospects of marketing
accumulations. If so, the Co-6p.’s earnings
during the current year will be considerably
increased. Of the past year’s net profit of
£12.003 both Jots of shareholders got 8 p.c.
on their holdings, but, this being a co-op.
concern, the producers received back in re-
bates of commission 45 p.c. of the net profit.
These bonuses represented 30 p.c. of com-
mission charged on all sales of wool, 10 p.c.
of livestock, stud-stoclc and produce charges.
In 13 years on wool alone this co. has re-
turned £74,000 to the grower. Owing, no
doubt, to marketing difficulties, book debts,
and, in turn, the co.’s liabilities, are still
large. Here is a comparison of balance-
sheet figures going back to just prior to the
addition of two storeys to the co.’s big Pyr-
mont stores:—

The business has made rapid progress, and
the directors are preparing for still further
expansion: a building site, which they re-
port is the best remaining site for wool-store
construction in the Pyrmont area, has been
acquired adjacent to the existing stores.

This is an English co. which has been giving
decent burial to four banks which succumbed
in the crash of 30 years ago. Asset realisa-
tion cos. took over what was left of the City
of Melbourne, Federal of Australia, English
and Australian, and the Mercantile; later,
the Melbourne Trust acquired the asset cos.
The job proved much more profitable than
the English and Scotch crowd who took over
the wreckage had anticipated, and results
have been much better than indicated by the
introductory table. The recovery from the
smash was swift, and the £392,485 of deben-
tures with which the Trust began were
wholly repaid by 1910, and the books then
showed a surplus of realisations over book
values of £145,709. Values generally had
so improved that the directors, instead of
thereafter showing big profits and paying fat
dividends, decided to take credit for the
recovery, and issued £246,559 of bonus deben-
tures carrying 4 p.c. All except £37,538 of
these debentures have since been repaid.
Lately regular 8 p.c. divs. have been dis-
tributed, and in three years nearly £25,000
has gone into reserve. A little of the accumu-
lation in recent years has been the surplus
of profits over losses on realisation of old
properties. This shows movements of the
debenture account and realisation results over
a number of years:—

The sale results are included with figures
in the introductory table. Incidentally,
the co. shows profits less the amount of taxes
it pays on behalf of shareholders. Last year
£4lOO went to pay taxes of 3s. sd. in the £,
and that amount has been included both with
profits and divs. in the table, profits also
being credited with the £1134 surplus on
realisations and £2575 War Loan interest.
The profits given by the table are, therefore,
£7809 more than those disclosed by the direc-
tors.
The Melbourne Trust’s interests are no
longer confined to the old derelicts : the co.
has new investments which far exceed the

1921.. 225,394 241,068 37,682 36,370
The latest accounts give a.n admirable de-
tailed account of the new investments. The
£241,068 is made up of: Government securi-
ties, £59,427; industrial and other securi-
ties, £109,095; loans against securities anc
to other cos., £45,546 ; deposits, £27 ; 000. Dur-
ing the past year the management increased
its indebtedness to assist its new investments,
but, including the debentures with debts, at
December 31 there was a surplus of more
or less liquid assets over liabilities of
£155,774. Paid capital is £300,000, so there
were old assets with" a book value (1910) of
£225,394, and purchasers’ balances of
£37,682 to support £114,226 of capital. In
view r of the extent of assets in relation to
paid capital the dividend return is slender,
but the co. is interested in sheep stations
and sugar estates, and no doubt neither has
shown good returns lately, while taxation has
been oppressive.

Sugar-growing and crushing has always been
an erratic industry, but when the ups and
downs have been measured there has gener-
ally been a fair margin of ups. Fairymead,
however, has had more than its fair share
of downs, and over the course of the table
has visibly done very little beyond averag-
ing a 6 p.c. div. It is not quite 10 years
since the co. was formed to take over the
A., H. and E. Young sugar interests in the
Bundaberg and Isis districts: the purchase
price was £260,000 —£150,000 in shares and
the balance in cash. There was no goodwill
consideration: instead, canefields valued at
£180,780 were passed over for £140,000, and
plant, assessed at £121,297, for £120,000.
The co. thus acquired assets for £42,077 less
than valuation figures. The float put an-
other £5OOO into the enterprise, pa : d capital
being £265,000 in £1 shares, at which figure
it still remains.
Fairymead has had a. succession of
troubles since early in this co.’s career.
Plantation costs rose early in the war-
period, but; price-fixing bodies reduced retail
sugar prices, the £2l per ton declared price
being 10 guineas less than the price at which
foreign-grown stuff could be imported; later,
when the price was increased, a prolonged
drought intervened; later still, new wages
awards again cut into profits. Conditions
improved under the Commonwealth sugar
agreement, and after two dividend-less years,
due mainly to poor seasons—the 1920 mill-
ing was only one-fifth of normal output
—on this occasion a good profit has again
been made and divs. totalling 12 p.c. have
been distributed. The table shows £36,150
of reserves in hand after making these dis-
tributions, but whether that is actual stored
profit depends on the nature of the replace-
ment fund, which holds £36,000 of the
accumulation. This replacement reserve has
been added to as profits have permitted, and
nothing has been visibly withdrawn or writ-
ten off. Anyway, Fairymead has shown
none of the fatness which the public gen-
erally associates with the sugar business:
it has averaged only 6 p.c. p.a. over 10 years,
and has lately had to call upon every penny
of a reserve fund of £23,500 to balance its
P. and 1,, account.
Fairymead balance-sheet figures since the
first accounts were presented have shown
very few fluctuations of importance, except
those due to seasonal financing:—

Siiortland Islands Plantations, Ltd. —
This plantation co. is in the Burns-Philp
group, and has spent £46,654 in 11 years
developing two estates totalling 19,293 acres
in the British Solomons. So far only 1511
acres are planted. Of the £50,000 nominal
capital £44,755 has been got in, but £11,805
net from produce has helped financing
of the enterprise. The output of copra is
improving as the earlier plantings come into
bearing, and production for the past three
years has been as follows: 1920, 148-i tons:
1921, 189 tons; 1922, 252 tons. But copra
prices have been so low that increased pro-
duction has not helped the co. to any extent.

llie continued delay by tlie Technical Com-
mission in issuing its report on health condi-
tions is holding up Broken Hill. This com-
mission, which is paid by the year instead of
03' the job, w r as expected to have issued its
nnal report many months ago. It is gener-
ally expected that the report will be more
favorable than otherwise to the mines, and
it is also known that unless the assertions
ot sundry labor agitators as to the mines
being “hell holes” are borne out, the latter
will repudiate the Commission. Meanwhile,
the cos. which have sufficient funds to work
on are faithfully abiding by the Edmunds
award, and the rest of them are down and
out. The position is bad for the mines
and the workers: the former cannot make a
do of it, and the latter feel thej r have no
security of tenure. At the present time
retreatment of old dumps is keeping the
majority of the employees going, but 12
months will see the finish of that work.
B. II- Junction North continues to write
oft amounts for legal expenses in its arbitra-
uon case against the Prop. Junction North
had a contract with Pirie Smelters (then
owned by the B. H. Prop.) when the war
broke out. The day before England
declared war the co. received notice of
suspension from the B. H. Prop. The
Junction North reckons it lost a lot of
profitable business which went to other cos
which became interested in the smelters later
®, n > t .! OI W , 1 1 Broken Hill generally thought
that it did better with its stuff by hanging
on for a couple of years. However, arbitra-
tion has been proceeding off and on for

• attacking Associated Smelters
m Junky North’s half-yearly report, chair-
man Joe Palmer laid himself open to a nasty
poke in the eye. The fact that Pirie had
been able to buj r ore in Tasmania against
the Hermans should have made him more
careful. At any rate, the Smelters have
come back at him and offered to smelt
Junkj T ’s “chocolates” (as their concentrates
are unpopularly known to the lumpers at
1 me) at what Palmer gives as his pre-war
charge. They have also published a fairly
recent letter lie wrote to them lauding their
work. The Smelter people must be com-
mended tor their improved metallurgy, and
they are making genuine efforts to reduce
costs. Junction North’s chief trouble lies at
the Broken Hill end —a low-grade, refractory
material for treatment, plus high wages and
short hours.

W estralian Mines Minister Scaddan has
been on a tour of the goldfields, incidentally
casting an eye on State batteries with a
view, it is believed, of closing some and leas-
ing others. Batteries-superintendent Howe
is known to be anxious to shed the respon-
sibility of many of the plants, some of which
are obsolete or in bad disrepair. Prospectors
are anxiously waiting to hear if the Gov-
ernment proposes to amend its batteries
policy.
Freney’s will commence boring about the
end of this month, and Okes-Durack at a
considerably later date. Shares are no
longer m demand, but a more active market
may be expected when boring operations
commence and progress reports attract pubi c
attention.

Ingliston, of Meekatharra (W.A.), has
106.000 shares of ss. each, the present
market price of which is 11s. In a depressed
gold market it is the one show that keeps
It® en( l up. The mine has been worked for
—0 years, and to-day the reef is beng worked
at the 487 ft. level, and in a winze below
that is 3ft. wide going about 15dwt. The
country rock at this depth is extremelv hard
It is difficult to believe that the mine’s pro-
mise justifies a market valuation of over
£50.000; but an estimate of ore reserves and
gold content might throw light on the posi-
tion.
Fair developments continue at the 50ft.
and 70ft. levels at Ives’ Reward (W.A.) :
ore up to 7ft. wide worth 15dwt. has been
exposed. It is at the 120 ft. level that share-
holders are anxiously awaiting developments,
and recently there has been no reassuring,
announcement as to the state of the mine
at this depth. The last that was heard of
the level was that it was considerably dis-
turbed, and if there is no impi-ovement the
outlook is not good. The disturbance may,
after all, not be vital, but development*!]
work should he pushed ahead at tins’ levpl
to ascertain the actual behavior of the lode
at depth. Until that work is done not much
importance can be attached to developments
in upper levels.

Six months ago much was expected from a
gold-bearing area east of Bullfinch (W.A.'
Sufficient work has since been done over
a big area to show that the new find is
nothing more than a prospectors’ field. On
a number of blocks prospectors are obe*'"
iug parcels up to 30 tons from narrow veins,
and which may y ; eld an average up to 2oz.
Nothing bigger has been sighted, consequently
option-takers are glum,
* * * *
The biggest gold-bearing ore deposit
worked in Westralia to-date has been the
Great Victoria, 30 miles south of Southern
Cross. At a number of points the lode is
over 200 ft. wide, and four miners can keep
a 10-head mill going without effort. Last
month’s run yielded by amalgamation £320
worth of bullion from 630 tons, and the tail-
ings contain a similar extractable gold con-
tent. Private owners have struggled along
with the mine for about 20 years, but the
proposition has proved too big for them.
They have received at least one good offer
to purchase, when all mining costs were
lower than now, but this thev declined.

The final report of the Queensland Gov-
ernment Geologist on the oil found in the
Tainbo bores confirms the fact that there
is a small amount of petroliferous matter in
the samples obtained, but he is not enthusi-
astic over the prospects of obtaining pay-
able pools in that district. The fossil evi-
dence showed that the bores are in the cre-
taceous marines, a younger formation ■ than
the petroliferous gas-beds at Roma. After
considering the character and structure of
these beds, his verdict is unfavorable, mainly
on the grounds that folding is too gentle for
such a recent formation, that there is a lack
of porous rocks, and there has been insuffi-
cient cover to have effected pressure or
retain volatile (light) oils. This must, of
course, be construed as only applying to
the surface formations, and does not mean
that lower beds in the Tamho district are
necessarily barren of oil. There. is some
prospect of a southern co. putting down a
bore a few thousand feot to test the under-
lying strata on the strength of the small
amounts found near the surface, and on the
assumption that the extension of the Roina
beds underlies this district.

Developments in the Silver Spur (Q.)
continue to keep manager Edgar Hall in an
optimistic frame of mind. As a mine it is
somewhat of a dark horse, for there has been
sufficient complexity introduced by faulting
to make Hail and L. C. Ball, who have done
a lot of work underground in attempting the
geological interpretation, to despair at times
of a solution. . Anyway, the new lode now
being worked is a chance discovery dating
back several years, and the ore mined has
possibly been richer than any found in the
old lode. Enough work has now been done
to assure definitely a large area which will
carry payable ore. A further body has just
been found in the north drive at the 120 ft.
level, and this has naturally made the man-
agement hopeful for further shoots, pos-
sibly dislocations by faulting of the
new lode.. This lode has been excep-
tionally rich in gold, running to six
and seven ounces in parts, and it also
carries native silver, fahl-ore and silver sul-
phides, whereas the old lode carried much
copper, lead and zinc. In fact, the absence
of copper lias hindered the resumption of
matte, smelting at the mine, and the present
practice is to send the first-grade stuff to
Port Ivembla, while the remainder is being
stacked awaiting better conditions for
local smelting. There are now a few hun-
dred tons of the latter at grass estimated to
average 60oz. silver. During the last quar-
ter 90 tons went to Ivembla for an average
of lOOoz. silver and 3dw-t. gold. This is a
lower average than past parcels from the
lode, but the stuff came from the 150 ft. level,
and the high gold values at 120 ft. have not
gone down. A shrewd manager like Edgar
Ilall, however, is probablv keeping some-
thing up his sleeve, and is not likely to allow-
all the rich stuff to be gouged out. The old
mine looks as if its best days may be in
the future.

The bores put down by State Superin-
tendent of Coal Mines on the Injune Creek
line, near Roma (Q.), are reported to have
struck two 4ft. seams of workable coal near
the railway line at a depth of under 200 ft
Ibis will mean cheaper coal for the rail-
ways west of Roma, as present supplies are
drawn mainly from Oakey. The saving in
freight will be 200 miles and upwards. The
coal is gassy, and very similar to that being
worked in the Darling Downs collieries. A
great area of country to the north of Roma
is known to be coal-bearing, and there is
no doubt that in the future it will become
one of Queensland’s important coalfields For
a start it is intended to establish a State
colliery at Injune Creek. The last Govern-
ment vrature in coal in this quarter of the
State was at Warrah, but it came a thud
about three years ago.
There is soreness amongst the Burrum
(Q.) coalowners owing- to the rebate nfforded
in railway freights on coal from the Baralaba
State mine, and which enables it to sunnlv
Gymnie mines and others with fuel for about
ss. : less per ton than Burrum. Gympie.
owing to its proximity, has alwavs been
looked on as a preserve of the latter, and
Baralaba coal has to stand nearly 300 mules
further carriage. Burrum coal, on account
of the thinness of the seams and the cost
ot bad standing ground, has been about the
most expensive at the pithead in the State.
On the other hand, the State mine has an
att. seam, but still it couldn't compete for
southern trade without the aid of preferen-
tial freights*
Mungana”: After the Queensland Gov-
ernment acquired the Chillagoe Co.’s smelt-
ers and mineral leases, Private Enterprise
was again allowed to work the Mungana
mines. Later the Government took the Lady
Jane and Girofla on tribute from Reid and
party, with an option to purchase. Accord-
ing to the press, a sale has been effected
at £4U,000. So the mines have not been
acquired from Chillagoe (B. 20/4/’22)'.
Having worked on both mines for many
yeais I don t think much of the deal, unless
something entirely new is discovered; and
already thousands of feet of prospecting have
been done with diamond drill with appa-
rently no very good results. It is well
known that large quantities of good ore
were in sight at the time of the big fall in
the Lady Jane, but mining of this ore is
gomg to prove both dangerous and costly.
The new lode in Girofla’s No. 3 level was
struck prior to the closing down of the lead
furnace in September last, but owing to
the refractory nature of the ore it has to
be pulveriser! and treated bv the Edwards
furnace or by roasting processes prior to
smelting. So the stuff will have to be rich
to cover treatment costs. Apart from these
considerations, the public is entitled to know
why, if the Government wanted the mines,
they were not taken over when abandoned,
instead of waiting to pay Reid and party
tor the privilege.
* * * *
Holders 0 f New Red, White and Blue
(Vic.) got on to two good patches last week.
Onq arose out of the better sprinkling of
gold in the spurry formations being driven
on at ir>4oft. The other came from as neat a
bear pinch as has been seen since Dickenson
assaulted the market over A 1 Gaffneys. One
broker admits to being hit, but he will pay
20s. in the £. He might not have been so
badly knocked had the buying been done a
little differently: a fall of 6s. per share the
day after the covering was done tells a tale.
As for the mine, no justification exists yet
for putting scrip to 2Ss. The spurs are not
far overhead, and have a lot of mullock be-
tween. They are not fully opened up along
the level beyond the stope, and though some
rich stone is coming it is a gamble to value
a mine on an enrichment. The deposition
of gold has been influenced by the intruded
dykes. Slates also are highly carbonaceous,
and at Bendigo, as in Gympie, when they
come along-, especially with any faulting,
gold generally shows. A blend of the rich
stone broken for a width of about 12ft. and
stuff from a poorer run of western spurs is
providing the battery feed. If bigger mill-
ings are ordered more low-grade dirt will
have to be sent to the stamps. With a 7dwt.
or Bdwt. grade maintained, a solid basis
will be provided for the progressive work
needed to pick up the rich gold at 1600 ft.
and 1700 ft., as well as to see if the spurs
carry well towards the south shaft, 600 ft.
awmy. In _ the misty past the Red, White
and Blue line put up some scorching yields,
but in late years it has crippled more men
than it has made. The present change in
the luck lets in a few floats. As there is
plenty of untested ground on the line, any
extension of the gold in the New Blue will
end in a big rush for blocks the full length-
of the line.
* - * * «
Another Bendigo show that is going
through the second advent is the Nell
Gwynne, which in the good days of the
past was a fair producer. It is on the line
after which it is named, but the present
Melbourne crowd do not intend to go deep,
as George Lansell would, but intend to try
the shallow ground. They are to work out
into the eastern run of stone where very
little has been done. Already they have got oil
to an inverted saddle, but most old Bendigo-
nians would not place as much trust in such
formations as they would in anticlines.
Driving has been proceeding on the east leg
of the inverted saddle, and the stone has
widened to 18in. with a color or two of gold
showing. Of course, it is all good pros-
pecting, but it is good policy to push out
a crosscut to see if centre country will
carry a decent anticline. The Nell Gwynne
is in a gold-bearing zone, so the eo. has the
usual Bendigo chance.
“Wagtail”: Let me inform “An Old
Hand” (B. 27/4/’22) that in more than one
place on the Bendigo field the rock in the
face was quite hot. In the bottom level at
the old New Chum Railway the ooze from
the face was hot, and we had to keep a cold
water-jet playing on the face at all times.
At the 3060 ft. level at the Great Extended
Hustlers, I have seen more than one miner
nearly jump out of his skin, when, not think-
ing, he would lean against the wall. It was
not always necessary to go 3000 ft. or 4000 ft.
to find the hot ends. The 1700 ft. level at the
Hustlers Royal Reserve, Pall Mall, Bendigo,
was as bad as any. We used to work six-
hour shifts, and the day’s work was generally
a half-hour at the face and a half-hour out
for a blow alternately for six hours. These
are only a few ; others of a notorious charac-
ter were the Shamrock, Garibaldi, Johnson,
and scores of others. Although such health-
breaking mines, they seemed to hold some
fascination. Certainly it was not the pecuni-
ary aspect which attracted the miner—4ss.
per week.
* * * *
Peacock’s office has a hustle on over Tyr-
connel North. Penny calls have been paid
by the faithful in order to drive a tunnel
2400 ft. under Mt. Blackwood (Vic.) and
put in various crosscuts to the east. The
district for the last half-century has had
an easy reputation, and the Tyreonnel North
went thither as a forlorn hope after freez-
ing in Westralia. A spurrv formation met
in the east crosscut at 302 ft. is showing
assays, while from the north drive
samples come from the face. Geolo-
gist Baragwanath fixes the field as one of
saddle formations, and with good gold show-
ing in three crosscuts the directors couldn’t
resist the inducement to pick up a 11501 b.
stamp-battery. So Peacock’s office may be
able to perform the impossible directly in
opening up another Bendigo in the shadows
of Mt. Blackwood.
The coal seams at Catamaran, in the
Speck’s far south-east, may soon be exploited.
Twelve years ago a local investor spent £4OOO
on development, and later a further £l5OO.
but was unable to achieve much. Now the
Catamaran Colliery Pty., Ltd., in 25,000 £1
shares, is at work. The seams have shown
promise of both quantity and quality, and
means are being arranged for carrying the
coal from the field to the mouth of the Cata-
maran River, about 50 miles south of Hobart.
A co. of Queenslanders is also at work two
miles noi'tli-west of the Catamaran, and a
series of test bores are to be put down before
they launch out in a big way.
Sheffield (Tas.) is somewhat excited over
the reported discovery, by a Melbourne syn-
dicate, of rich galena ore at Wilmot River.
Assays have given 1440 z. silver and S 6 p.c.
lead, and as the show is only five miles from
the old Round Hill mine further develop-
ment, is anxiously awaited.

‘T>.F.”: The first discovery of tin in Aus-
tralia goes back to 1798, when Matthew
Flinders found a few grains of it on Preser-
vation Island, Bass Strait. The first dis-
covery in N. S. Wales is claimed to be that
by C. S. McGlew, at Long Gully, Bun-
gonia, near Goulburn, in 18'68. McGlew and
others worked the deposit in 1871, and within
a year or two tin was found in quantities at
Thomas’s Plains and elsewhere in the north-
east of the Speck, and Philosopher Smith
had struck Mount Bischoff.

Harry Minogue, who was admitted to the
Bar by the Vic. Full Court the other day,
is the second son of the Under-Treasurer.
So far his manner suggests the self-assurance
of Justice Starke of 20-odd years ago when
be used to “cheek” the Judges after making
sure of his facts and his law. Young
Minogue has dipped deeply into English,
French and Spanish literature, and is a
ready writer.
Brigadier-General B. C- (“Tiny”) Frey-
berg, V.C., C.M.G., D. 5.0.. of Wellington
(M.L.), was invested with the D.C.L. at St.
Andrew’s University, Scotland, last month.
He is the youngest of Britain’s generals.
Two brothers—Paul (killed in France) and
Oscar (killed in Gallipoli)—helped the
family to its title of “The Fighting Frey-
bergs of Wellington.” This remarkable man
is to be married in June to a Mrs. McLaren,
whose brother-in-law was one-time First
Lord of the Admiralty.
Trained for the law in the Cold Land,
John Ambrose
Kitchen, just dead
at 88, found when
he came to Melb.
68 years ago that
there was more
coin in tallow pro-
ducts, so he went
in for soan and
candles, and, with
other members of
the family, made
his pile. He was

tor of the pro-
prietary co. till the

line he grew apples
in a big orchard
at Pakerham. The
hulk of his wealth

“Coot”: Robert Coombs, just dead at
Molong (N.S.W.), who used to say he was
in Ballarat (Vie.) at the time of the Eureka
Stockade, also declared that he was a valet
of Sir Roger Tichborne, and was the
last person to shake hands with the baronet
when the latter left for Australia and disap-
peared. Coombs himself arrived in Mel-
bourne in 1854.
Prof. Thomas Ranken Ryle, who has been
'insulted with a K.8.E., already had a kite’s-
•ail of capitals headed by D.Sc. (which one
the Sydney dailies printed D.S.C.!) and
.R.S. He was born at Coleraine, Ireland,
a 1860, and had done well at Dublin ’Var-
ty before he got the Natural Philosophy
hair at Melbourne Uni. in 1889. During
ie war he was. on the Commonwealth
lunitions Committee, and handed some
valued tips to the Navy Board. Nowadays
he is one of the Morwell Electricity Com-
missioners.

' “T.0.1.”i The father of the poet Holds-
worth (B. 25/5/’22) was P. R. Holdsworth,
a boat-builder, of Woolloomooloo Bay, and
a shining light in the
old Temperance Hall,
Titt-strect, Sydney.
The son had a clerk-
shin in the Treasury,
when G. H. Reid was
correspondence clerk
there, but later he be-
came Secretary to the
Forest Department,
on which for a time
Henry Kendall was an
inspector. For several
years he was hon.
to the Athenaeum
Club, and he also had
a term as editor of
the Illustrated
Sydney News. He
married Kate Atkins
in 1869. and for some
mysterious reason
always carried a small
bottle of ether in his
coat-tail pocket.
D. G. PATERSON ,
Federal President,
Commercial Travel-
lers' Association.
“Xox” tells how the Mighty relax: —
So far as I can gather the hobbies of Federal
Ministers are as follow: Hughes devotes himself to
cigarette-smoking, trying to suppress the assertive-
ness of his official secretary, Deane, and battling with
a hammer and nails to make his country shack safe
from democracy. Bruce divides his time between
creasing his pants and searching for the perfect hair-
dresser. Greene strives tirelessly to invent a machine
that can be fastened to a cow at one end and
deliver the churned juice in pound blocks at the other.
Groom is a referee at ludo tournaments and tennis
parties, and uppercuts the Higher Criticism at
Anglican gatheriftgs. Rodgers concentrates on miss-
ing trains, eating large dinners and quoting Dryden
to people who suspect the poet of being a new sort
of sheep-dip. Poynton spends his leisure wondering
whether his head would look any larger in a convex
mirror. Foster, a true-blue Soustralian Liberal in a
Nationalist Cabinet, is understood to be quietly study-
ing for the Under 90 “Open Scene” at the Ballarat
competitions. Lamond is alleged to be a hard
vinegar-drinker—the idea being to keep his vocabul-
ary in proper nick for the discussion of Victorians.
Ryrie likes exercising at the punching-ball with the
features of Tom Walsh painted on it. Marks is
addicted to bowls, yachting, the study of Copernicus,
Todhunter and Revelation as a means of arriving
the exact minute when the end of the world will
occur. Millen’s hobby is himself. Earle is said to
be writing a volume on how to be a statesman with-
out State or status; and Pearce is busy mounting and
cataloguing the bands from the cigars that Harding,
Balfour and Co. gave him at Washington.
Justinian Oxenham, who got under the
shower of birthday honors and was struck
with an 1.5.0., has been secretary to the
Central Post Office Administration since
1910. In the late ’seventies he was a clerk
in the Bananaland Telegraph Department,
and when the P.O. was taken over bv the
infant Commonwealth in 1901 he jumped
into the post of private sec. to Drake. t*>«
first Federal P.M.G. Then he became chief
clerk to Robert Scott, and when the latter
retired from the job of official spoter-:
Oxenham moved into his place. He has re-
presented Australia at two postal con-
gresses—at Rome (1906) and Madrid
(1920).
Although Ernest Terah Hooley got only
two years hard labor, while Rottomley
has been given seven years’ penal ser-
vitude, Horatio has achieved the lighter sen-
tence. “Hard labor” in England means work-
ing from 6 a.m. till 7 p.m. at picking oakum,
and the stuff must be shredded as fine as a
hair. At 7 p.m. it is weighed, and if the
malefactor has not picked four pounds, his
blankets are taken away aDd the tarry
“junk” is thrown back into thf> cell to be
de?lt with during the night. “Penal servi-
tude” means that the prisoner’s abilities are
put to some use; he earns money and has a
small sum on his release. The chances are
that Bottomley will be sent to the penal
settlement in the Isle of Wight, where he
will be employed as a clerk. He has tw r o
appeals nominally—one to the Court of
Appeal and the other to the Lords. But
consent has to be got from the Attorney-
General for the latter, and there is little
chance of its being given to Bottomley.
Spiked his last slip of copy, Alfred Eugene
Bishop, “Goodwood” of The Australasian.
He was born at Smythesdale (Vic.) 59
years ago, and the first newspaper he was
connected with was the local Advocate.
After plodding the Inky Way in Geelong and
Bendigo he went to Melbourne and was suc-
cessively sporting editor of the Herald and
the now defunct Sportsman and World.
His association with Wilson and Mackinnon
began in 1891.
Lord Dunkellin, whose statue has been
dragged through the mire in Galway streets
and pitched into the sea, was the eldest son of
that fjord Clanricarde whose second son left
the family millions to Princess Mary’s hus-
band, Lascelles. Dunkellin died before his
father, and by so doing in a sense made
the match over which the Empire has been
enthusing. Certain it is that if Lord Las-
celles had not got the Clanricarde fortune he
would have had to seek a humbler bride
than a Princess of a reigning house.
Joseph Hatch, lately lessee of Macquarie
Island and a candidate for Denison at the
coming Speck elections, is an octogenarian or
thereabouts. His “dodgers” are embellished
with a Macquarie Islet snapshot labelled
“Mr. Hatch teaching the king penguin howto
talk.” The document also mentions that the
aspirant for favor was Mayor of Invercar-
gill (M.L.) in 1878. and a member of M.L.
Parliament from 1884 till 1887.
Ex-superintendent W. Creaghe, who died
at Albury the other day, had been associated
with the N. S. Wales police force exactly
60 years. It was he who led the party that
squelched Clarke’s bushranging gang in
1864 after they had terrorised the Monaro
for months. Following a raid in which the
outlaws murdered Constable O’Brady,
Creaghe and his men cantured the whole
gang with the exception of Pat O’Connell,
who was shot.
If knighthoods counted for anything the
fall of the accolade on the shoulder of Pre-
mier Barwell, of S.A.—an Imperialist of
fighting age who never served in the war and
a white man who advocates a colored Aus-
tralia —might be taken as a studied affront
a;med by Downing-street * , t the sentiments
of 95 per cent, of the inhabitants of the Com-
monwealth. But the thing has become a
howling farce. In the same list as that in
which Barwell figures appears the intima-
tion that William Mills, inventor of the
Mills bomb, has been.given a K.B.E. This
man was .instrumental;w saving thousands
of British lives; and it has been said of him
(by General Gough) that “he did more than
any one man to win the war for the Allies.”
And four years after the fighting has Stopped
he gets the same decoration as was awarded
to Tom Henley, of Sydney, for sticking a
lieut.-colonel’s crown and star on a Comforts
Fund uniform and littering Shepheard’s
Hotel and Horseferry-road with aspirates.
The Mitchell Library (N.S.W.) lately
acquired from the National Art Gallery a
dozen portraits (grouped) by
Charles Rodins. Among them
are Jacob Josephson, a jeweller
of the Macquarie era, who
founded a family now very
wealthy; Edward Broadhurst
and William Foster, Bar-lead-
ers in their day, 'and Henry
Parkes. The last-named was
clean shorn, and had been
sketched in the witness-box at
the Central while giving evi-
dence against certain Eurasian
compositors imported by him,
who broke their agreement. In
the grotir) there is a central
figure dressed d la Count
D’Orsay, labelled “The Comet” :
but no one seems to know who the Comet
was.
“Thorold”: Bathurst’s NATfoNAL Advo-
cate, which decided to appeal last week
as-ainst the verdict in its recent marathon
libel suit, has probably had more edi-
tors than any sheet in Australia.
Frank Fox, Louis Esson, Frank Morton
and many others equally well known
(including at least one curate) have
thundered from the little shack opposite
the pub that Pat ICenna conducted for
so many years; and Billy Hughes was
on the contributing staff for some time,
supplying specials every Saturday. One
man recommended by me had a passion for
the bottle, and the manager demurred. “He’s
only just off a bender,” he objected.
“Exactly, but that means he’ll be on the
water-waggon for the next six months, and
he’ll be a patriarch among Advocate edi-
tors if he lasts as long as that.” Unfortu-
nately the scribe hit the Paris of the West
at its most festive period— i.e., during show
week—and his editorial sanctum on the
first night looked like a brewery. In sheer
desperation they engaged me, and I filled in
the next half-year as the district’s political,
agricultural and literary mentor.
“Harold Hardupp”: I struck Horatio
Bottomley several times in London. Once
was at an Inman-Newman billiard match.
Innm a Daused, studying the balls, and Bot-
tomley arose stagily and advised him what
shot to make! No man in England
loved the limelight more. On the other
hand the next time I encountered him he
was carrying a ragged infant, while the
mother and two other children followed, in
a search for rooms. The woman’s house had
been smashed by Fritz during a raid. Bot-
tomiey said: “Aussie, give a hand with
those youngsters, will you?” And when he
found a lodging he not only paid the rent for
many weeks in advance, but gave the woman
some notes. There was no swank or self-
advertisement in this, for h° didn’t mention
h.s name, and the woman didn’t know it.
John Henry Dabb, BA., 8.D., is the first
Australian minister at Cairns Memorial
Church, East Melb. Born at Richmond, the
son of a pioneer grocer there, he was edu-
cated at Scotch College, Queen’s College
(Arts), and Ormond College (Theology), and
got his B.L). degree at Melbourne College of
Divinity. He was ordained in T 7 at Devon-
port (Tas.), has done locum work for the
Rev. Dr. Sevmour (Adelaide), and has lat-
terly been officiating at St. Andrew’s, Perth.
C. E. Weigall, the new N.S.W. Crown
Prosecutor, bears the sharp features and
prominent chin of his dad, who headmas-
tered the Sydney Grammar School for many
years. His rise is from Parliamentary
Draughtsman. His present job was pre-
viously held by Bevan, White and Wade,
all of whom have been made Judges, and by
Coyle, who has “acted” often. Another
Weigall was readmitted to practice in
N.S.W. as an attorney the other day after
10 years’ practising in India.
The British birthday honors this year were
unashamedly handed out as rewards for suc-
cessful money-making. The peers were b
wick, head of a big engineering firm; Robin-
son, the S’African millionaire, whose virtue,
as set forth by one brief description, is that
“he acquired 20,000 acres on the Vaal River
and found diamonds there”; Waring, of the
furniture firm that went bankrupt and then
made a spirited recovery; and Vestey, of
the meat business. After a survey of the
batch that preceded this one Winston
Churchill’s cousin, the Duke of Marlborough,
is said to have complained: “If this kind of
thing goes on there won’t be an “h” in the
House of Lords in another 10 years.”
A photograph of the three Maorilanders
mentioned in the “honors” list last week
would show an abbreviated politician, an
elongated schoolmaster and a fat, half-caste
Maori. Billy Carncross, Speaker of the Leg.
Council, has been in the Legislature over
30 years. Pie might possi' . measure sft.
2£in. over all, and tip the °am at fully
Ist. In the long ago Billy was Seddon’s
Whip in the House of Reps., and served that
massive battler with unwavering devotion.

principles of Rugby football it was the
youngster’s fault, not Firth’s. The third,
Mani Pomare, originated in a kaianga near
Mt. Egmont. Captured young by the emis-
saries of a Yankee gospel sect, he was trans-
ported to Chicago; but eventually escaping
with a medical diploma under his arm, he
became Government health-officer among the
North Island Maoris. Later he drifted into
politics. Pomare is about 45, and has been
prescribing frequent heavy meals for himself
during most of that time.
“FLAIR.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Miss is tall and slim, and has a flair for
dancing, tennis and dress.” —From beneath . an ,y nor*
trait in any society weekly. -
Miss Mary Anne de Sumwon j
(Her picture’s on the right)
Is the daughter of a magnate
And a leading social light.
She has a flair for dancing,
In her set, unequalled, quite.
You can see her at the Palais
Or the Wentworth any night.
She doesn’t care for children,
She tells you with a sigh;
They’re messy little creatures
And so inclined to cry.
But she has a flair for dressing—
That the dullest can descry—
For how to wear a “straight-lined” frock
And how a plait should lie.
She couldn’t cook a flathead
On a maidless, desert isle;
She’d perish there of hunger
With a faint, esthetic smile.
She has quite a flair for tennis
(And a weary, drooping eye),
And though she’s none for marriage
Yet she may give it a fly.
She has a flair for flirting,
For toying with a fan,
For anj'thing that helps to lure
A young and moneyed man.
But just one flair the press folk miss,
Which no one seems to ban,
Her flair of flairs, it is—l mean,
Her flair for Mary Anne!

“Kewpie”: Witnesses in law cases are
allowed several different ways of taking the
oath. But the right to use an entirely new
form was claimed in a Maoriland court
recently, when a budding Socialist stepped
into the box, repudiated Christianity, and
demanded , to be sworn by “Karl Marx and
the materialistic conception of history.”
• » • »
“Fax”: The action brought against
Jowett’s £5 suit-maker in Melbourne by the
Granville tweed manufacturers,
of Sydney, must have set a
number of expensively-attired
men thinking of their tailors’
bills. According to the original
contract between the manufac-
turers and the maker-up.
Jowett’s suit-length was to
measure less than 3{ yards at
11s. 6d. a yard, or 375. in all,
whilst the tailoring thereof—
linings, trimmings and making
—was to be three guineas.
Naturally, the man who pays,
.say, 16 guineas, for a sac suit
'wants to know what he is get-
ting for the extra money. The
price of the cloth in the law-
suit case was, it seems, reduced
■by agreement from 11s. 6d. to
9s. 6d. per yard, whereas a very
good imported cloth might cost
the tailor 30s. a yard—a lib-
eral assumption. If, then, we
allow the expensive tailor to
have paid £3 7s. 6d. more for
his cloth than the Jowett suit-
producer paid, the cost would
be £5 4s. 6d. And three
guineas for tailoring and the
price works out at £8 7s. 6d
Double the tailoring costs and
the total still remains well be-
low the figure that eight well-
to-do men out of ten are paying
nowadays for the suits they go
to work in. . And, finally, there
is at least one man (a S.vd-
neyite) who asks 26 guineas cash for every
lounge suit he makes. Aye, and gets it-
too. from some of the hardest-headed
Hebrews in the town.

At Denmark (S.A.), the other day, ap ex-
school-teacher claimed that the mother of a
pupil had 3aid things about his morals which
were worth heavy
damages. The de-
fending lawyer
asked only one
question : “H o w
old are you ?” and
on that the case
crashed, for the
answer was
“Twenty and a
half.” In the eye
of the Law he was
bqt an infant and
could not indulge
in the luxury pf
law-suits. His
legal adviser, who
had travelled from
Adelaide to take the
case, apologised to
the Court, explain-
ing that he had
never dreamed his
client, whose occu-
pation was given
as “on the land,
formerly school-
t e a c li e r,” was
under age. The
point is, of course,
not that allcomers
can say anything
thpy like about a
youth till he is old
enough to vote,
but that if he
wants to bring
them to account
he must do it through a relative or “next
friend.”

“0.K.”: It is characteristic of modern
methods that the hangman now starts work
two hours later than of old. The imported
hour for “working off’.’- a malefactor was
8 a.m.
So here I’ll watch the night and wait
To see the morning shine,
When he will hear the stroke of eight,
And not the stroke of nine,
sang the “Shropshire Lad.” lam under the
impression that th£ execution of Deeming—
the only tragedy of the kind I ever witnessed
-—was fixed for 8 o’clock in that same Mel-
bourne Gaol which soon will be no more.
But the killing of Colin Ross took place at
the luxurious hour of 10 a.m., only half an
hour earlier than Burlington Bertie’s hour
for rising. Our ancestors used to get these
unpleasant things over as soon as possible.
It was true kindness to the prisoner. I
trust the time will never come in this easy-
going country when a hanging will be an
evening function.
Christchurch (M.L.) hotelkeepers have
given up the measurement of “nips” of
spirits which was brought in as a war-
measure, and the old-time practice of putting
the bottle on the counter is again the rule.
Bung is no philanthropist, and the meaning
of the change is that, on the whole, dr nkers
take less Lf left to tikeir own devices than when
a paternal Government prescribed for them
as a means of helping to save the Empire.

produced many idiotic reactions everywhere;
but M.L. seems to be the only place where
such superfluous activities resulted in the
promotion of drunkenness.

“Hitric”: “Skipper’s” par (B. l/6/’22),
mentioning “Gertie’s” method of dealing
with leadswingers tells but half the story.
“Skipper” says it was “Give him an egg,
Corporal,” and adds that the .supply of eggs
was inexhaustible. But so was the supply
of “No. 9” which issued from the same
cruse. “Gertie,” questioned on this strange
recuperative mixture, drily remarked: “The
first feeds, the second flushes.” I never
saw a leadswinger last a week on the tonic.
“Zanthus”: Maorilanders have
a lot to say about their French
village of Akawa, but Aus-
tralia once had its French
settlement, too. In the days when
French whalers worked the Bight
Coast, some French sailors started
a farm on Middle Island, east of
Esperance (W.A.). They had
sheep and goats, and grew vege-
tables. The venture was going
Strong in 1840 when Eyre made
his overland journey from Fowl-
er’s Bay to Albany. Incidentally,
lie would not have won through
at all, only he came across the
French whaler Mississippi (com-
nianded by an Englishman, Ros-
fciterl at Lucky Bay, and so got
supplies. In those days there were
800 whalers, mostly French and
American, wmrking off the South-
ern and western coasts of Australia.
The Sydney police raid on the “Cavalier”
restaurant is another example of the imbe-
cility of the N. S. Wales liquor laws and
their administration. The type of diners who
patronise such places do not go in for “high
teas”: they want something to drink with
their evening meal. The law does not forb'd
this : it merely says the restaurant must buy
or receive the stuff before 6 p.m. of the day
on which it is to be consumed, and on that
day only. It is absolutely impossible to
make a rational citizen <*ee the moral differ-
ence between paying for a bottle of wine to
be delivered at a restaurant before 6, and
paying for the same commodity on the assur-
ance of a waiter that it has been bought
before 6. It is well known that if the
failway and tramway employees obeyed the
strict letter of the laws designed to safe-
guard themselves and the oublic the entire
N.S.W. traffic system would be disorganised :
and in the same way, if all the unlicensed
Sydney restaurants that are expected to get
in the whisky, wine and beer consumed
nightly by their customers, tried to do so in
strict accordance with the Act, some of the
chief city streets would be rendered impass-
able during the most crowded hours of the
day. The raiding of places like the “Cava-
lier” does nothing to promote temperance:
these are just the resorts —the haunts of
self-conscious suburbanites struggling so
hard to appear fashionable that they hardly
dare to eat —where the drunk constitutes an
outrageous exception. The only result of
suppressing them is to buttress tne monopoly
held by the large hotels, many of which are
boozing-kens pure and simple—places where
anv citizen who has the slightest claim to
eminence in dipsomania can get all he wants
to drink, with or without meals, for himself

Even the Speck suffers from the One Big
City disease. From 1911 to 1921 Hobart
gained 5620 persons by the excess of arrivals
over departures—the great majority from the
country. Nineteen backblocks municipalities
out of 51 actually lost population, though
the birth-rate is higher in the country than
in the city. Only five showed an excess of
arrivals (from outside) over departures, and
the sum total of such increments was only
1120. The Speck had an excess of births
over deaths of 36,487 for the 10 years, but
the actual increase was onlv 22,666, because
13,821 were lost by emigration. Naturally,
therefore, it has one of W. M. Hughes’s
special immigration officials on the job.

A King’s Man on some honors: —
An inmate of a Victorian lunatic-asylum, who
recently petitioned the authorities for his release
on the ground o' regained sanity, signed himself
‘‘Admiral Field-Marshal Sir Benjamin Dash, V.C.,
K.C.8., D. 5.0., A.8.C.” When asked what A.B.C.
stood for, he replied: “Why any damfool knows that
—it’s Archbishop of Canterbury.” Like that luna-
tic, I am much impressed by titles. The Honor-
li ts never fail to induce in me a pleasing mind
picture of the King, giving the order to one of his
Ministers: “Let the Fountain of Honor play upon
Bill Brown, of ‘Emoh,’ Plantagenet-street, Cremorne
Point, Sydney (or it may be Alf Smith of Bulla-
Bulla, S.A.), for the loyal fellow has well earned a
titular drenching. I ha\e followed his career assidu-
ously, and can no longer withhold this mark of an
Empire’s approval.” Without a doubt Bill, Alf and
the rest are all highly deserving characters. George
Tallis, for instance, was honored as a mark of appre-
ciation of the unpaid work of actors and actresses
for war and other charities. True, his part in it
was not to pay them. But it is doubtful if his
Majesty, ever mindful of the susceptibilities of the
lieges, could in any case have further refrained
from ennobling Tallis, seeing that he had already done
as much in the case of the world-famous head of the
Fuller circuit. I was delighted, also, to learn that
the Mayor of Geelong—l have forgotten his name —
had been made a C.M.G. It was worthy of his
office. And who will deny that Mr. Oakes, of Svdney,
(“Good Old Charlie” to Nationalist Paddington) is
at least the Victorian’s equal in other things besides
his decoration? A study of the honors awarded to
women is not less instructive. Melba has been
honored —and so has the wife of the Prime Minister.
We know what Melba has done. She has made us
ANOTHER USE FOR THEM.
“The safety zones in the city streets are working
satisfactorily.” —News item.
proud of her. And similarly we, who know our
Prime Minister’s qualities, can join with the King
in honoring Dame Hughes’s Christian fortitude.

ACROSS THE HEADS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
V growing gale is screaming
And capping waves with white;
1 lirough leaden rain down-streaming,
Far shines the South Head light.
But we are homeward faring,
And little is our caring
As we go rolling, rolling,
Across the Heads by night.
The pilot lights are winking
Their eyes of green and red,
U hile billows, rising, sinking,
Roll in on Middle Head,
Roll in and on, white sheeted,
And then cast-off, defeated,
By sturdy walls of sandstone,
Fall back, their fury sped.
Seaward a tug is toiling—
-111 weather ’tis' to roam—
To Fort Dobroyd is boiling
With acres of fierce foam ; /
The engine-room is throbbing,
A frightened child is sobbing,
As we go plunging, pitching.
Through darkened waters home.
The pit of night is crowded
With voices, loud and low;
Fast headlands, gloom enshrouded.
And points that dimly show,
We plough, while, drawn together,
Men talk of wind and weather,
And storms that scourged the coastline
A score of years ago.
SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO.
"I don't think it’s right that the old fellows
should have all the young and pretty
wives.”
"Have patience. You may live to he an old
fellow yourself yet.”
Though black waves follow after,
And waves before us run,
The cabin’s full of laughter
And boisterous with fun;
For though the rain be pouring,
And winter winds be roaring ;
We’re homeward, homeward going
And toil of day is done.
A rising gale is screaming
And capping waves with white,
The leaden rain is teeming
On beach and slope and height,
But we are homeward faring,
And little is our caring
As we go rolling rolling.
Across the Heads by night.

Lexite”: The Divorce Court sees some
brass-hided respondents betimes. The testi-
mony of a recent careworn petitioner re-
vealed that she had never had any home
but a room, and that frequently an empty
one; that her husband had knocked her
down, blackened both her eyes and belabored
other portions of her anatomy with pots,
bricks, kitchen chairs and the like. He
drank to excess habitually, and gambled
away any money that Bung didn’t get. The
respondent admitted that the lady’s charges
were substantially correct. “But, your
Worship,” lie cried in the ringing tones of
one proud in the consciousness of more than
Roman virtue, “she can’t say that I ever
misbehaved myself with other women!”

_“S. Guffin”: Re “Ashmead’s” par (B.
2.j,/5/’22) on self-inflicted wounds. I have
heard that, when no accomplice or assistant
was available, a sandbag over the destined
place was regarded as the best specific for
preventing a suspicious discoloration. But
there was a keen lookout kept for made-to-
order “Blighties.” In the case of a Bendigo
Digger of my acquaintance the first injury
of his that was located at the dressing-
station was a puncture in the arch of the
foot. A Pommy sergeant scrutinised it
knowingly, and mentioned his resultant sus-
picions to an overworked medico. I heard
the latter’s answer: “Might be one. Ser-
geant: have some particulars taken at the
base.” Then the wounded man put in a
woixh “Plug the boles in me blanky shoulder
first,” he drawled. It turned out that an
enemy machine-gunner had potted him from
a flying-machine.

“Gagi” tells of anew way of rubbing it in :
On admission the lady was found to have a broken
nose, both eyes out of commission, and certain
abrasions on the body that might have suggested to
NOTHING LEFT.
HE: “But if you were engaged to a man for
file yearn and then he jilted you,
wouldn't you sue him for breach of pro-
mise?"
SHE: Certainly not. If I was engaged to
him for tire years he wouldn't be worth
suing."
a Sherlock Holmes a booted assailant. She became
conscious on the second day. That afternoon an
angel of mercy called and stood by the bedside, but
refused a proffered chair. She was told that she
might speak to the sufferer. “No,'* she remarked
loudly. “Belle, nere, don’t wan ter fork to me, do
yer. Belle':'' Belle, who had not spoken one word
since her admittance, opened her only working eye
and glared unresponsivelv. The visitor came regu-

larly until Belle began to sit up in a bath-chair,
after which her calls ceased. The nurse commented
on the defection. “She seemed quite to take an
interest in you, too. Always asked after your nose;
wanted to know exactly how many stitches yon
had put in you” “An’ why shudden she?” wailed
Belinda. “That’s only her way ter skite, nurse.”
“Skite?” “Yus, blaster! It was she wot guv ’em

“Phthisis”: “Dolerite's” par (B. 25/5/’22)y
re the woman who married a Broken Hill
miner with phthisis and will draw com-
pensation as a dependant when he passes,
states but one side of a distinctly debatable
case. A Digger I knew was drawing the
“totally and permanently disabled” pension
of £4 weekly. His trouble was chronic but
not likely to kill him for many years if he
was well cared for. He married a girl who
was also “delicate” and compelled to live
quietly in the country. The pair being sen-
sible people are much better and happier
for it. Of course, such marriages must be
childless. It is obvious that the disabled
Digger cannot always clothe himself and get
proper attention on his pension. The writer
himself is on a £4 pension, of which £1 weekly
goes in medicine and special food, another
on clothes, laundry, stamps, papers, etc.,
leaving £2 to provide accommodation with
skilled attention in a healthy climate. And
these last cannot be got under four or five
guineas.

“T. 0.1.” : A property in George-street, Syd-
ney, shortly to come under the hammer, has
housed watchmakers for at least 80 years
and possibly much longer. It belongs to the
Oatley family, and Frederick of that ilk con-
ducted a watch and jewellery business there
in the early ’forties. He was followed by John
Forrester, who kept going for something like
40 years, and then handed over to William
Kerr, another watchmaker.. From the
Macquarie era until the advent of Frederick
Oatley, the father of the family, James
Oatley, carried on a clock- and watch-
business in another part of George-
street. He specialised in grandfather
clocks, two of which I know haven't stopped
short yet. James Oatley is buried in the
bush ut Lakemba ; the nearby railway plat-
form is called after him. There is a legend
that (Governor Macquarie gave James Oat-
ley a grant of 000 acres at the place named
in return ,#»r the manufacture of the clock
which still adorns the front of Hyde Park
Barracks, now the Law Courts, and which
still, after a century's wear and tear, keeps
good tip’"'
A firm of Melbourne assignees adver-
tised the other day that “a first and
final dividend is to be declared in the estate
of John Mnstori,” and that “creditors who
have not proved their claims by June 7 will
be excluded.” In 1838 Muston acquired
the fee simple of a little Bourke-street
right-of-way. In 1842 he filed his schedule,
and either through the remissness of his ori-
ginal trustee, or because the lane was consid-
ered valueless, nothing was done to realise on
it. A purchaser of a valuable city property
lately had the title investigated,' with the
rqsult that after 80 years a new trustee
of Muston’s estate was appointed, and the
land sold. If no centenarian creditor has
put in an appearance by to-day (Thursday)
the State Treasurer will scoop a pool that
should be well worth pocketing.

“Resurgam” from the depths
Here’s how I spent a cheap week-end recently in
Sydney. Saturday night: bed in the Night Refuge
(free). Sunday: Sandwiches and tea at the City
Mission’s free breakfast, Milson’s Point, 8.30; bowl
of soup and bread at the Kent-street soup-kitchen at
noon; sandwiches and tea at Ardill’s corrugated-
iron shed, behind Commonwealth-street, at 4 pun.
“And so to bed,” as Pepys- would say, at the Night
Refuge once more. At all these places we had to
pay in the form of illiterate sermons hurled at us
by amateur clerics (mostly pious young men badly
in need of a sound kicking), who took it for
granted that we were criminals. By the way, if the
Lord Mayor is really under the delusion that there
are now no Sydney people living in places unfit for
human habitation, let him disguise himself to look
hard-lip, and put in a night at the dosshouse in
Kent-street run by the Salvation Army. It is the
dirtiest place I know, and I have wooed the goddess
Sleep in some insanitary places since I first fell
from social grace. The Salvos charge 6d. a time,
and the free “Night Refuge” is infinitely preferable.
But it is almost as difficult to get into as the Union
Club these hard times.

“Bristoek” offers a hypothesis:—
Two pars, prompt me to add a further remark con-
cerning sex-determination. “X2X” (B. 13/4/’22)
suggests, in effect, that to produce males the mother
should stimulate her physical fitness. “Azrim” (B.
U/5/’22) says males result from fertilisation of
young ova. Mv own inexpert theory, which seems
to fit in with and fill out those quoted, is as follows:
(1) There are times when one parent is more potent
than the other. This is especially true of the mother.
But the rule (if it is a rule) is subject to the dis-
turbing element of special individual dominance or
otherwise. (2) The tendency is to transmit the oppo-
site sex. This is notorious respecting details of
heredity—-may it not be a general rule, part of the
balance of nature. It may thus be possible to deter-
mine sex by regulating the mating, if the conditions
of prepotency can be ascertained.
* ♦ * <
“Sergeant Ashheap” on the raising of a
mask:—
He was one of those silent, impassive young
Englishmen whom one reads about in fiction, but
all too rarely meets. Nothing excited or amused
or annoyed him. He had done good work on the
Peninsula as a gunner, transferred to the Camelicrs
with a commission after the Evacuation; and
came to us at Stink Farm, below Messilies Ridge,
as B.C. In all circumstances—under shell-fire, at
inspections by C.R.A.’s behind the line, in face
of the blasphemous rage of our C.O.—he was cool,
unmoved, imperturbable. He got his majority pre-
maturely, and we expected some signs of gratifica-
tion at (he news. He did not accord it so
much as a smile of welcome. And then came an
exceptionally good bit of work, and the adjutant
blew into the dugout one morning to say that our
inhumanly wooden boss had been recommended for,
and awarded a C.M.G. — not a D. 5.0.: for some
reason, known only to the Heads, it was a C.M.G.
A strange expression came oxer the young officer's
immobile countenance. Was it joy, grief or the
beginnings of ail epileptic seizure. We were soon
enlightened. “Hurrah!” he cried in his queer, tone-
less voice. And again “Hurrah!” He then bounded
twice into the air in a deliberate manner, and
reaching for his revolver fired it at the roof, takirg
care, while doing so, to avoid various hanging
articles. Again he observed “Hurrah!” and in a
final burst of ecstasy proclaimed “I’m in.” “In
what?” someone asked, “In what ? In Debrett.”
For the first time we learned, then, that a C.M.G.-
winner pushed, ipso facto, into the nominal roll of
dukes, marquises, and so on. Hardly had we
assimilated the tremendous news, however, ere the
Major had regained the captaincy of his features.
Wild, exultant thoughts were his, no doubt, as he
mused in the days that followed on the glorious com-
pany which was implied by his red and blue
ribbon; but while he was with us he never smiled
again.

“Dido” tells a tale of shameful deception:
The City and Suburban Mission had its head-
quarters in a small lane in the vicinity of Little
Bourke, occupying the ground-floor of a barn-like
structure, where it ministered to the spiritual wants
of downtrodden ladies from the Chinese quarter, re-
pentant heathens from China and India, and battered
white men suffering from excess of opium or beer.
The C.O. was a small, pale, pimpled parson, and
his coadjutors were good young men from neighbor-
ing Sunday-schools, with an occasional coadjutrix
•of the better classes bent on rescuing the perishing.
Over the mission room the Ajax Athletic Club was
domiciled, and because of the sympathy and help
afforded by the Rev, John Fox-Dobbin, it presently
changed its name to the Wesley Athletic Association,
and sometimes it had the Rev. Fox-Dobbin to give
it a brief address or to partake of a cup of gingier-
beer and a scone. On such occasions the lady-
helpers from the mission sang hymns. Eventually
the Athletic Association regarded itself as in a mea-
TRUTH IN ADVERTISING.
sure incorporated with the City and Suburban Mis-
sion, and took to providing brands still smouldering
from the burning for the Mission to extinguish.
There were times when five or six representatives of
the Wesley Athletic Association drank tea with the
City Mission, and engaged promiscuously in prayer
on the mission’s premises. If any bad example be-
came obstreperous on the hands of the Rev. Fox-
Dobbin he had only to call up the pipe, and the
Athletic Association would take the too demonstra-
tive sinner in hand, and bring him to a sound know-
ledge of what was due to his betters. As time went
on the two institutions were drawn closer and closer
together. The Athletic Assoc, had even padded its
floors so that violent exertion On the part of its
members would not interfere with night prayers and
hymn-singing on the floor below. The Rev. Fox-
Dobbin was quite proud of the connection, and boasted
of it as demonstrating the signal influence for good
he was able to exert over the young and the hardy.
Then one night the police raided the Wesley Athletic
Association, and rooted it up, rump and stump. It
was a thriving, extremely lucrative two-up school,
and, alas! had never really been anything else.
A TRIBUTE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Though many curse (and some do worse),
Still do I state as my opinion,
Among the nation quite alone,
That he who made the telephone
And planted it through our dominion—
Post upon post, an endless host
Of sparrow-perches, not one missed,
With several million miles- of wires—
Did it not for cur base desires,
But as an earnest moralist.
-Mere words, of course, can have no force
Like practical examples given.
A telephone (the bet I’ll make)
The fiercest sinner’s heart will break,
And make him fit for Heaven.
For slow but sure it holds the cure
Of nasty temper, pride and hate;
It. teaches man how low and base
He is, how sad this earthly place,
Where all must humbly stand and wait.
I hold, indeed, that as years speed.
Two moral species will be named,
Of all such classes left alone—
The meek who own a telephone:
The ’phoueless who arc yet untamed.
And s 0 on earth of higher worth
Than all the pulpit’s vague banality,
I would laud high his work who bade
The poles be planted, wires be laid
Of this great system of morality.

Rio ’: Hasn’t Billy Hughes got a saddle
of his own? A press photo taken before the
debacle at Grafton shows that he was using the
01 dinary cavalry pattern gear. The average coun-
tij horse hates the cumbrous military head-collar,
with its heavy bit and extra curb rein, and when
Bucephalus shows his displeasure the smooth, padless
cowhide seat gives no grip at all, especially to a
short, light man. Many a better rider than Billy
has involuntarily dismounted under such conditions.
Mont that £25,000 run to a decent saddle?

“Snell”: Merton was 50ft. below, filling
the buckets with broken reef. Caster was on top at
the windlass. Presently, dropping the nail-keg
bucket back on its hook hanging in the shaft (a
distinct breach of ethics) Caster missed the point,
and the iron keg went clattering down the shaft.
His hasty “Look up, below!” came too late. The
bucket landed somewhere with a dull thud. Caster,
prone on his stomach, made anxious inquiries, and
faintly up the shaft came Merton’s voice: “Yiv
ruined me hat. Damyerize, yiv teetotally spoiled
me hat on me!” There were further groanings, and
Caster cried impatiently: “But you needn’t make
that hullaballoo over a rotten old hat.” “Shut up
yer face,” moaned Merton —“me head’s in it!”
* * * *
“Jim Carew”: I struck a curious legend
among a tribe of abos. I met near the Macdonnell
Ranges, Centralia. They said there was once a
beautiful young lubra that all the young bucks
were anxious to marry. But she would have nothing
to do with any of them, except two noted young
warriors and hunters, and as to which of these two
she would wed she could not make up her mind.
At last she promised
to bestow Ihier hand
upon the one who won
a race to the top of
a neighboring* moun-
tain and back. The
night before the event
a debbil-debbil visited
one of the contestants,
promised to help him
win, and breathed on
both his feet. When
the race started this
man shot out in front,
and had reached the
summit and was half-
way down again before
his opponent had
reached the top. He
was sailing along at
a teriffic pace when he
suddenly disappeared,
and was never peen
again. The other
competitor duly reached
the winning-post, and
went to claim his
bride; but she, too,
had vanished, leaving
no trace behind her.
Matter-of-faet white
men reckon the lead-
ing Binghi fell over a
cliff and his body re-
mained hidden in the
undergrowth, and while
all the tribe was watch-
ing the race a buck
from a neighboring
tribe came and stole
the prize. But Binghi
put the whole happen-
ing down to super-
natural influence, and
induce the tribe to
the disappearing trick
even now nothing would
camp anywhere near where
was done.

‘•Myall” : A while ago I found one of my
cows with her tongue hanging out and very black.
It had been bitten by a snake and there were two
punctures on the edge. I gave her half a cup of
the juice of a banana-root, and half an hour later
I repeated the dose. On the third day the tongue
had started to mortify. I drenched her with linseed
and washed her mouth with disinfectant. In a
week three inches of the tongue dropped off; but
the end healed over, and after three months on long
grass I sold her as a fat. The vet. that saw her
after I had got her right and the purchaser can
bear me out.

“Te Whare” : The homing instinct of meat-
ants, chronicled by “Bios” (B.’ 27/4/’22), has its
counterpart in that of the honey-bee. A joke-loving
apiarist stole the queen from a wild swarm, and
leaving her majesty in a match-box at the tree car-
ried the others six miles in a box and sold the
queenless swarm to a friend, who promptly hived
them. Xext morning the whole swarm was missing.
It was found clustering lovingly round the match-
box which contained the queen. As to animals,
horses have a keen knowledge of locality, and will
find their way home unerringly, but pussy takes a
lot of beating as a homer.
A PERSONAL AFFAIR.
FIRST ELDER. : “Minister he do want you to
pray for Sammy Penryn."
SECOND ELDER : “For Sammy Penryn—that
owes me five pounds ?”
FIRST ELDER: “ Yiss. ’S all more reason
why you should put some sperrit into
it.”
“Jim Carew”: “Barcoo” (B. 18/5/’22)
makes a row about the “Ruthven Shriek” when
there is no need to. I camped there twice—once in
1904 and again in 1911 —and heard it each time.
There were three of us, all from the South Coast
(N.S.W.), and we unhesitatingly class the shriek as
the call of a bird, probably the screech-owl, which
is often heard in the South Coast ranges. Our horses,
also South Coasters, took no notice of it. There is
another bird of the owl species I have heard on the
coast of Cape York Peninsula that could be respon-
sible for the cry. Binghi knows him as the “death-
bird,” and on hearing him immediately and hurri-
edly shifts camp. If this bird had been heard near
the waterhole a few times Binghl’s early avoidance
of the place is only natural.
* * * *
“Zanthus”: The queerest of the 100 or so
species of rodents in Australasia is Conilurua
conditor, the nest-building rat of Central Australia.
Its domiciles of sticks, so worked in
together that they could hardly be
pulled apart and that dogs could
not get at the occupants, were noticed
by Sturt and other early explorers.
But the rat’s main stronghold is the
arid country around Ooldea, on the
East-West line, where there are thou-
sands of them. They know a thing
or two, for now that rabbits have
invaded the country they build their
nests over a burrow, which gives a
second line of defence if the nests are
removed. Away up in the desert
country towards the Musgrave Ranges
there is a rat, probably the same
species, which builds a nest Of stones,
sticks being scarce in those parts.
But the unique point about the conilu-
rus is the way it “carries” its young.
It does not carry them at all. They
just hang on to the teats apd are
dragged along. These rats are about
the size of a house rat, but more
stockily built, with light-brown fur,
and make a drumming noise by slap-
ping the tail on the ground. Only
two zoos in the world, Sydney and
Adelaide, have specimens, but they
breed freely in captivity. A pair .
in the Sydney Zoo had two litters, one of four and
one of two within seven weeks.
“J. 8.” : I was cutting down a green salmon-
gum tree at Kondinin (W.A.), and when half-way
through I struck a sr...:’l crevice from which came
a hissing sound like that of steam escaping. Being
curious I applied a lighted match, and all the hair
on my face and hands was singed with the small
explosion that followed. The flame was blue, just
like the burner on a primus stove. I have come
across three more trees that have hissed at me, but
each time I’ve kept my matches in my pocket.
“Gouger”: Up here in York Peninsula we
have a “tiger-cat” that stands as high as a hefty,
medium-sized dog. His body is lithe and sleek, and
beautifully striped - in black and grey. His pads are
armed with lancet-sharp claws of great tearing
strength. His ears are sharp and pricked, and his
head is shaped like that of a tiger. My introduc-
tion to this beauty was when
I heard one day a series of
scalp-lifting snarls from the
long buffalo-grass that skirted
a swamp. On peering through
the grass I saw a full-grown
male kangaroo, backed against
a tree; the flesh of one leg
was torn clean from the bone,
and the gasping beast plainly
showed that he was fighting
only because all w'ild things
fight till the very last. A
streak of black and grey shot
towards the ’roo’s throat, then
seemed to twist in mid air
—and the ’roo slid to earth
with his entrails literally torn
out. In my surprise I in-
cautiously rustled the grass)
and the great cat ceased the
warm feast he had promptly
started on, stood perfectly
still over his victim, and for
10 seconds returned me gaze
for gaze. Then the skin
wrinkled back from the nos-
trils, white fangs gleamed and
a low growl issued from the
ugly throat. It was a plain
“Come on you .” I
didn’t. I went backward and
lost no time in getting out
of that entangling grass. And
I always went armed after-
wards. The next brute I saw was dead. And beside
him lay my much-prized staghound, also dead. This
dog had been trained from puppyhood in tackling
wild boars, and praises of his strength and courage
were sung by prospectors all over the country. The
cat had come fossicking around my camp on the
Alice River.

“Mack”: Re never-failing creeks (B.
2/3/’22). My nomination is Back Creek, at Tuena
(N.S.W.), which has never stopped running, even
when the big main Tuena Creek has been merely a
dry sand-bed and the Abercrombie River a chain
of waterholes. But stranger still is the Black
Water Hole, near Cessnock (N.S.W.)—about 60ft.
by 80ft., and from 10 to 20 feet deep. It is
always full of good, fresh water, though a small
creek about two chains away and 20ft. lower than
the level of the waterhole has dried up several times.
* * * *
“Rag”: I know two camels who each wan
a £lOO bet with a darned fine performance. One
trotted 100 miles in 10 hours, and the other got
to his feet under a load of a ton of iron.

“280 A”: At the last Towers (N.Q.) show'
I was wandering about among the side-shows when
I heard a hypnotist declare he would give five of
Jask Collins’s best to any charitable institution if
he could not cast a spell over anyone there. Pre-
sently he caught the eye of a sun-dried bullocky.
“Look here, sir,” he said, “I’ll tell you what I’ll
do: I’ll hypnotise you and make you chew a candle!”
“You can’t,” grunted the cattle man. “Yes I can,
and to prove my words I’ll give £5 to the hospital
UNUSUAL.
“I can't wait for a yarn. I've got to get
home and cut the green stuff for the
cows and mend up the fences a hit."
“What! Ain’t the missus well?"
if I can’t.” “But you can’t,” drawled the bul-
locky. Something in that expressionless face arrested
the spruiker. “Why can’t I?” he asked. “Because.”
said the bushman with funereal solemnity, “I ain’t
got no blanky teeth.”

BILL’S DOG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
i had a dog,” said Bill to me, “a splendid sort
o' tyke;
In all the bushlar.d round about I never :,aw his
like—•
A dog amongst a thousand was that canine labelled
Mike.
Now, I was e’er a generous chap—a generous
chap indeed,”
Continued Bill, “and, so it came to pass, my heart
decreed
To give that dog to those who seemed a dog like
Mike to need.
I gave him first to Atkinson, who owned a golden
claim ;
I mentioned all Mike’s pedigree, and, likewise,
all his fame—
But, ere the night had sped away, to me back
Michael came!
“Next day I made another gift of him to one afar
Across the hills (I made Mike swim across the rocky
bar).
I said: ‘Don’t mention it, old man; he’s yours—
so there you are! ’
“But ere the evening came that dog—and this is
dinkum, man—
Was back with me (God knows how fast the old
cuss swam and ran !) ;
Yes, Mike was licking all the fat from off my
frying-pan!
“Again I gave that dog away—to someone passing
through—
A chap who said that he was bound beyond the dry
Barcoo.
He added: ‘Thank you, very much.’ I said: ‘The
same to you! ’
INSATIABLE.
BENJAMIN BUSH RAT: “Old mopoke's a
glutton. Listen to ’im. singin' out for
more porK when he's got all that cheese
to himself.”
“A week went by, and then at dawn I woke to hear
a sound.
‘nichaers returned!’ I muttered—‘Yes, that’s
Michael, I’ll be bound’;
And it was Michael, sure enough—the boomerang-
like hound! °
“Again a score of times again—I gave that dog
away— 6
Now fastened to a swagman’s rope—now tied beneath
a dray;
But ever Mike returned, and said: ‘Bill Blake I
want to stay!’ ’
“ Pi * plain • him ' 1 f6lt at laSt ’ and said in language
‘Endeavoring to get rid of you is hopelessly in vain.
So, Michael, Ive decided that you really must
remain 1 9
“And after that I fed him till a perfect dog was he:
The finest dog that any man could ever wish to see.
1 said: ‘Oh, Michael. I am glad I let you stay
with me.’
I petted him, I coddled him in every kindly way ;
I praised him till he dozed to dreams, and indo-
lently lay
Beside the fire and snored what seemed ‘l’m glad you
let me stay.’
“One morning I awoke, and called, and kept a-
calling on,
But ne er a sign came back to me—no sign or sound
... .Upon
My uord that dog which I had failed to give away
had gone! ”

“Tito” : “Artimus’s” hefty young Soustra-
lian (B. 18/5/'22) recalls an infantile giant I knew
in Melbourne about four j'ears ago. He was only 11
years of age and measured 6ft. 2in. He had no
surplus fat, and was muscular and broad-shouldered
with a large, sun-tanned face.
* * * #
“Don Q.”: The reptile I described (B.
6/4/’22) was not an outsize death-adder, as “Colub”
(B. 4/5/’22) conjectures, because it did not possess
the horny appendix peculiar to the adder. Inciden-
tally, I recently witnessed a test in connection with
the controversy as to whether the adder will strike
while a person has his boot on him. When trampled
on the wriggler turned out a good unionist and
almost dislocated his jaw in an endeavor to do harm.
Further experiments were conducted with a stick.
His “on guard” position was invariably a coil with
the head raised.
* * * »
“Mallee-Grub”: How’s this for “Holy
Han’s” ploughing stakes (B. 6/4/’22). A cocky
of my acquaintance on Yorke’s Peninsula (S.A.)
employed a man who averaged 14 acres per day over
460 a. one seeding. The implement used was a 10-
furrow Smith cultivating plough, cutting sft. lOin.
to a depth of 4in. Twelve horses hauled it for the
usual cocky’s hours. The going was good and the
man a grafter. I can vouch for this, as I was
driving the drill and had to- put up an average of
20a. a day, with a 13 x 7 hoe drill over the same
country.
“Pick”: If “D.F.” will re-examipe that
National Park (N.S.W.) sledge-tree (B. 18/5/’22),
he will find there is nothing extraordinary about the
seemingly hybrid vegetable. All that has hap-
paned is that the gum and ironbark plantlets
grew so closely together that the gum, being the
quicker grower, enfolded, without killing, the iron-
bark. Examples of the kind are fairly common,
and on one ridge north of Bermagui (N.S.W.) there

are many grotesque specimens. Some dissimilar
species are indistinguishablv joined at the trunk,
others have separate barrels with their branches
enjoined, and one huge spotted gum has a limb
(2ft. thick) of its neighbor growing healthily through
its Bft. trunk. No fissures indicate where the dif-
ferent woods are joined, because the separate barks
unite into one common covering.
“Moriac”: My nomination for the Endur-
ance Stakes is a Binghi who had broken some tribal
law or other. The mob knocked him on the head,
cut him open and took all his caul and kidney fat
in true abo. style, then left him to die. He crawled
through the bush about three miles to a white man’s

camp. The bushman was puzzled as to what to do,
but washed his intestines, put them inside again
and sewed the darkie up. In about six weeks the
nig. left him on vengeance bent, ns fit and well as
ever.
“C. Coral”: Re the par concerning the
crocodile’s spare set of blinkers (B. 2/2/’22). Up
here in the Straits the natives always aver that
the brutes have four eyes, and have pointed out
the same thing- that “J.T.K.” mentions. I can’t
say if the croc, is capable of finding his way about
with these particular organs; but, anyway, this is
my testimony for what it’s worth.
“Lip”: The Blanks were an old family in
our district and had reached the top of the social
pole. Pa and ma
Blank and the two
daughters, stylish girls
in the early twenties,
were at the local show
when they wei e
accosted by Black
Maggie, a gin famed
for her ugliness and
dirt. In the days when
pa and ma lived in a
two-roomed sha n t y
Maggie had assisted at
the welcoming into the
world of the daughters
and had been their
nurse for many years.
Pa and ma stopped and
had a word with her,
but the daughters,
with two city admirers
in tow, passed disdain-
fully on. Maggie
looked at them wide-
eyed for a minute, then
burst forth: “You

Blanks; but many the

the rest of it.

“Ivaitoa” : Re “D.F.’s” bail-inventing pro-
fessor (B. 4/5/’22). Why, cow-bails operated with
a piece of rope, flax or wire were used wjhen my
grand-dad was a boy. He says if the professor had
invented something to get the heifers into the bail
there would be something to write about.
“Talmat” : A friend of mine in Richmond
(Vic.) swears that he turned his Clydesdale mare
out for a spell in a common paddock in which a
Shetland pony stallion was running, and eventually
she threw a nondescript colt, Clydesdale in all
characteristics, but Shetland in size. Has any Abo.
heard of a like case? Personally, I ha’e ma doots.
“H. Ret”: If “Rhino” (B. 11/5/’22)
wants a sure way of settling the rhinoceros beetle,
he had better grow a few flame (flamboyant) trees on
his cocoanut plantations. The rhinos, will make a
blackguard rush for these trees. They fasten them-
selves on trunk and branches and suck the snake-
juice out of the bark, and when thoroughly inked they
fall to the ground. All “Rhino” has to do is to
keep carting them away to make room for their
friends. I have been on New Hebrides plantations
for the last 20 years, and have not seen a cocoanut
palm destroyed by beetles when these precautions
were taken.

“The Wanderer” : Bob Young once caught
some strange-looking stock on his property at Cadar
Party, near Wingham (N.S.W.), and promptly pushed
them into the pound. When the poundkeeper got to
work with the clippers he found that Bob had run-
in one of his own cattle. Bob admitted this the
other day in the Taree District Court, where he hap-
pened to have a case. The inspector of nuisances
at Taree once came across his own old saddle-nag'
cropping the grass in a public thoroughfare at night.
He yanked Darky off to the pound. It shows what
might happen to a blanky cow or horse on the North
Coast, anyhow.
“Jim Carew” : I recently saw tlie start of
a snake-goanna fight. The wriggler was basking
in the sun, when an old go. intruded on the scene.
They glared at each other for a few minutes, and
then the goanna moved in to close quarters. The
snake struck and the fight was on. Five minutes
later the go. was on his way, dragging his late
opponent after him. This scrap seemed to solve
the riddle for me of why the pair fight whenever they
meet. The goanna wants to make a meal of the
snake, and the snake objects. They fight, and
usually the go. gets his meal.
“K. Sped” : Apropos of the argument about
cow-milking snakes; let me remark that some time
ago I was working in a vineyard when a cow came
rushing down a nearby hill, bellowing and doing a
sort of dance. It charged clean through a couple
of pos&and-wire fences, then fell. After five minutes
of wild kicking it was dead. Next day I had the
beast examined. Its udder was distended enor-
mously, and it was found that it had been bitten on
one teat, close to the udder, by a snake.

“Pat Bushie”: “Bitter Bark” asks (B.
11/5/’22) how the green mantis breathes. If he
looks along the side of the mantis’s tummy he will
see small black dots at regular intervals. It’s through
those dots that the mantis, like all other insects,
takes in his air supplies.

“1.W.8.” The other day at Beelbangera
(N.S.W.) a young fellow named Clarke, working
on the steam subsoil ploughs, slipped under a road
wheel of a 28-ton Fowler engine. The 2ft. 6in.
wheel grazed the side of his head, then went over
his left arm two inches below the elbow. The
road was hard, and everybody expected the arm to
be mere pulp, but immediately after the accident
Clarke coolly got on his motor-bike and rode into
hospital, where he was relieved to find that there
would be no amputation. He says he felt no pain,
only a sort of numbness when the fingers burst open.
The doctor wouldn’t believe what had happened
until he went and personally saw the impression of
the arm on the roadway and checked an impression
on the limb with one of the rivets on the wheel.
Clarke has no feeling in the arm at presents—the
nerves have yet to recover from the shock of that
28 tons of ironmongery perambulating over them.

“K. Sped”: “Tinpot Bill’s” (B. 18/5/’22)
Tin Lizzie that started three times when standing by
herself, reminds me that, while riding overland from
Balranald to Melbourne, 1 stopped for the night at
a wayside pub. I left my “X” and side-car outside,
and to prevent theft I removed the magneto brushes
and slipped them into my pocket. Next day I
kicked up and came through to Melbourne, and on
cleaning the ’bus found I’d never replaced the car-
bons. The distributor was wiped and found perfectly
clean and—l’m still scratching my poll, as the ’bus
never missed a spark over 250 miles. Can any Abo.
mechanical genius explain?

“Manrico”: The other night I landed at
Rosedale (Vic.) in my Sunday best, and as it
was raining like blazes I borrowed an old coat from
one cove and old pants from another and walked the
six miles home. Next morning I discovered two stray
dogs tying on the doormat, and a few days later I
found that one belonged to the owner of the coat and
the other to the owner of the pants. What did they
take me for?
*■* * *
“Kaitoa” : I don’t care if you believe it or
not; it happened. We all knew that the fowls had
proved too much for Mick in the garden, but the
boss wasn’t prepared for the sight that greeted him
when he went out one morning. “For the love of
Mike, what's the matter with the fowls, Mick?”
“Well sor,” replied Mick, “They gave me no peace
in the garden, picking the seeds as fast as I sowed
’em, so I reckoned to fix the cows.” And he had,
well and truly. Every one of the 23 chooks w>'s
staggering about, fitted with a pair of stilts.
* * * •
“■Agricola” returns to a dead cow:—
“Exul’s” evidence in discussing the death of Straw-
berry after eating the bones qf a poisoned animal
(B. 27/4/’22) is as bad as the putrid flesh and bones
that contain the deadly toxin. The existence of
such toxin in some bones and flesh is not questioned,
but it is not the cause of heavy mortality. The losses
on a farm three miles from Hamilton (Vic.) ceased
after the owner had brought many loads of putrid
sheep-shanks from a fellmongery for his cows to
use as dessert. In hundreds of cases now the dis-
order has gone after the pasture has been top-
dressed with lime-phosphate. The schools do not
.vet teach the very definite truths recently established
by the bio-chemists as related to blood poverty and
debility of tissue. There is auto-toxa:mia, and toxaemia
from ingestion of plant-toxins, and again there is
the cryptogamic form. “Pica” is indicated by
depraved appetite and is due not alone to deficiency
of phosphoric oxide, but also of lime, sodium chlo-
ride, magnesia, iron, sulphur, etc., and as the ratios
vary so do the symptoms. Sir Arnold Theiler noted
“failure of oxidation” in “lamziekte” and, “a toxaemia”
that he could not account for because of his lament-
able ignorance of “the rfile of the salts” in the
cycle of breathing. Dr. S. Dodd described a toxaemia
that he found in his very patient and very expensive
and futile examination into the N. S. Wales “Braxy-
like-disease” of sheep, “for which he could not in
any way account” (vide his final report Agric. Jour-
nal, 1918). Theiler did deserve credit for his early
advice that it was a problem more for the farmer.
NO MODERN LUXURIES FOR HIM.
“Up in Sydney they're goin' in a lot fer
oyster-beds.”
“They can ’are 'ent Gimme a good old
straw bunk every time.”
We now have a vast amount of evidence that better
farming dispels the trouble. The manager of Burni-
mah station, Monaro (N.S.W.), saw that no “black
disease” happened in a paddock where sheep ate a
natural lick. A corresponding mixture was placed
in all paddocks, and after some months, the disease
permanently left the station. “Exul,” who I suspect
to be a medico, will hav£ accepted Theiler, Dodd
and Seddon’s dicta, and, he will profit much by
referring to the recent works by the leading physio-
logists and bio-chemists re body fluids and essential
mineral elements.

“ft stands
gram it is of course untrue because it is
the truth overstated, but for that very
reason it challenges attention —like the
painted face of a pretty girl. Away with
them both—the dangerous "made-up” flapper
of prose and the flighty little epigram of the
pavement. .
A poignant sense of gratitude compels me
to this task. I am powerless to think of
other things until I have written this unrest
out of my heart. It is very difficult to do,
not only because emotion is re-suffered in
the effort to express it truly, but chiefly
because I am forced to speak of myself, to
make clear all I owe to my unknown friend.
Since I can remember I have tried to
write, and nothing else hao ever really mat-
tered, In boyhood and youth it was, of
course, poetry: not mere verse, but im-
mortal poetry—better than lveats. Every
young writer should try to excel Keats: the
effort helps him to a better knowledge of
himself —and Keats.
At the age of 30 I married and settled
doVvfl to prose. I have published less than
any Australian writer of my age, but I
think I have torn up more. Like many
others I have followed the pale glimpses of
my Star as best I could, with one eye on
the kids and the domestic bills. It still shines
as far ahead as ever; that is a way Stars
have. It must be death and hell to grab
your Star when you are 30, and to have to
keep it in the safe-deposit, with nothing left
to follow —except, of course, the unobtrusive
funeral of a suicide soul. How does a
writer at last get near his Star? I think
he keeps on writing merely good stuff and
tearing it up, and better and still better
stuff, and tearing that up—all but the very
best, until fastidious Nature tears hint up-
all but the very best. I Owe what little I
have done —a “dolor” from ft ton of tailings}
ft speck of radiUin from a inountaih of elfty—:
solely to the life-long companionship and
purifying influence of ray waste-paper basket.
In The; Bulletin Christmas ilumber,
1920, appeared a well-written article on
Australian writers, signed with a name I did
not know. It mentioned me as a writer of
“very good prose.” I was delighted. After
25 years’ hard work tearing-up it was more
than my vanity that thrilled to this tribute
from one whose impersonal praise was, I
felt, true praise. True praise is a purely
intellectual statement of fact, untainted by
a trace of any emotion. Others, including
reviewers, had given me most generous en-
couragement, but they were either friends
inclined to please, or fools who saw fit to
flatter, and the rare wine of praise is
ruined by any flavor not its own. What
wonder I keenly felt the praise this stranger
suddenly flashed to the world from the. lofty
sky-sign of the Red Page?
I impulsively resolved to write to him,
c/o Bulletin. I wanted him to know how
his solitary shout, “Go it, O'Reilly!” had
bucked me up as I entered on the last lap
of my long race, and encouraged me to hope
that, if I could not -win the prize, I might
yet be placed. Other writers will sympa-
thise with me in the effusive exhilaration of
that moment. After a life of total abstinence,
over-proof praise is very apt to go to the
heart, I felt that a _ letter, quick with
gratitude, must please him as it would please
me, were our positions reversed. But, as
the days passed, mean misgivings of the
mind paralysed the first impulse. He might
misunderstand, he might think —-this, that
ftnd the other. I put off the letter, but the
impulse to write came back every time I
sipped in secret his refreshing praise.
In June, 1921, a great idea got hold of me,
and I began work on it. It was of course
to be the best thing I had ever written—
really “very good prose,” which would cer-
tainly catch the eye of that chap whose un-
known name had long since slipped my
memory. But somehow the thing went
wrong from the start: the great idea grew
deformed in spite of endless tearing-up; ugly
excrescences bulged everywhere; work
became a nightmare of frenzied labor and
futile surgery. Worst of all, an amazing
monkey suddenly materialised in defiance of
all art, and the great idea fled with a shriek,
while the hateful creature prowled at large
from page to page. By Christmas the
still unfinished article had swollen to 8000
words —mostly tumor and monkey. I put
it aside for three months. In March I looked
at it again, tore up 7000 words, and was
cheered to realise that the surviving 1000
were the best work I had yet done. The
great idea came back with a rush, and, full
of confidence, I tackled it again. I was
quite certain I could do something really
worth doing—why should I ever feel “down,”
with the cordial of that stranger’s praise to
pick me up?
This time the great idea slowly took its
own shape. Of course there were many
black nights when I wrote and re-wrote in
vain. But there were also nights when
the soul was cloudless and serene, and
my heart beat fast as the glim-
mering thoughts shone clearly out in splen-
did words and phrases like clustered stars.
Then, shaken with joy, the old gratitude
always surged up. i pictured his smiling
appreciation of certain favorite passages—
how he would dwell, not merely on their
finished grace, but also on the faithful work
that went before. When the great idea was
published, and he read it, I would certainly
write to him ; then, without doubt, he must
be pleased.
Yesterday, May 11, I left the typed
copy (3500 words) with the editor of The
Bulletin. He kindly promised to let me
know his decision next day. When I called
this morning- he told me he intended to keep
my article for the Christmas number, and
that I might look in at the office at once, if
T cared to. Such moments are worth liv-
ing. Outside, I ran into Willy, the youth-
ful guardian of the editorial door.
“Willy,” I said impulsively, “will you let
me see a file of the 1920 Christmas num-
ber?”
He brought it. I found the article. It
was signed “Frank Grayson.”
“Do you know this chap?” I asked, point-
ing to the name. He looked, and pondered.
“No.”
“Has he written anything for The Bul-
letin lately?”
“No—l don’t think so.”
“I want to write to him at once. If I
address a letter c/o Bulletin, will it be
forwarded?” *
“Wait a moment—l’ll see if they know him
at the office.”
When Willy returned he said quietly:
“ ‘Frank Grayson’ was Bertram Stevens.”
DOWELL O’REILLY.
Lennox Robinson
Among the Irish dramatists only J. M.
Synge takes a higher place than Lennox
Robinson, whose play, “The White-headed
Boy,” is now delighting Australian audi-
ences. Robinson is the son of a Presby-
terian minister; and his boyhood was spent
in the county of Cork. He has chosen the
everyday life of modern Ireland as the
groundwork for liis plays, and much that he
lias written has a purpose beyond the mere
interplay of character and idea. When the
Abbey Theatre company came to Cork he
saw the medium in which lie could work
and “The Clancy Name,” his first play, was
produced by the Irish Players when he was
22. It is a rather grim study of a powerful
managing woman and a son who holds the
terrible secret of a murder he has committed.
Though the work in “The Clancy Name’'
does not compare with much that he has
done since, it is a remarkable first effort.
Robinson is now 30, and has grown in every
way. His view of life has mellowed ;• much
of the hard Synge-like tendency to look for
unlovely types is gone; and his craftsman-
ship is nearly perfect. As stage-manager at
the little Abbey Theatre —the house has seat-
ing for exactly 502 peoole—he learned a
great deal; but bis larger dramatic educa-
tion was in the homes of the people whom
he so faithfully presents. “Harvest,” which
was first played in 1910, narrowly missed
the same stormy reception which greeted
Synge’s “Playboy of the Western World.”
It is primarily a picture of life on a Cork
farm, but makes the bitterest sort of attack
on the type of schoolmaster who tries to
drive every bright pupil to seek advancement
away from home. The Hurley farm is in
danger of being lost to the family, all whose
brightest members ale scattered and regarded
as enhancing the credit of the district. One
holds a position ih England, which has lifted
him so high that he never writes home ; one
is a struggling lawyer in the west of Ire-
land ; another is a poverty-stricken chemist’s
assistant in Dublin ; and Mary, who is the
beauty of the family, is supposed to have a
post as secretary or something in London.
It is the last-mentioned who alone of all the
brothers and sisters can find the money to
avert ruin; and the shock of the play is
caused by the knowledge that she has been
living as the mistress of several rich men
in succession. The old sweet home-life of
these people of the soil has been utterly
destroyed by the Schoolmaster; and there is
the feeling that nothing at all has been
gained. “The Crossroads,” which was pro-
duced a year before “Harvest,” has also
a purpose. It is directed against the loveless
marriages so common in Ireland. Ellen,
while an assistant in a Dublin bookshop,
has half fallen in love with Brian Connor;
but, to give her sister a chance in town, she
returns home with a desire to put in practice
some modern ideas of farming she has picked
up in her reading. She knows Tom Demp-
sey to be a brute, but she marries him for
his farm and the opportunity it gives her.
Misery follows; and then Brian Connor,
who has won success as a novelist, finds her
and urges her to come away with him.
Ellen’s children are dead; her farm has
failed, though she has shown others the way
to success; but she will not leave her hus-
band. The two men fight, and Connor is
choking Dempsey to death when Ellen stops
him. Dempsey believes she has only inter-
vened to save her lover from the gallows,
not to save himself from death. This is the
end of the play :
Tom: I’ll tell you what I’m doing. I’m locking
the door the way you won’t go after that young
man; an’ I’m going to step down to the village
now for a sup of drink. An’ then —I’m coming
back; an’, by God, I’ll make you pay for this night’s
work, Ellen McCarthy, till you’d wish you were dead
—for the black curse you brought on this farm, an’
for the liking you have to the young man.
On that the curtain falls, with the woman
sitting at the table with staring, hopeless eyes
waiting for the unimagined brutality that is
to come.
Both in “Harvest” and “The Crossroads”
Lennox Robinson’s purpose is to convey
something like a direct lesson; in “The
White-headed Boy” no such motive is evi-
dent. The play is pure comedy, touched as
all Irish comedy must be with something of
pathos; but it goes to the very roots of
Irish life. Anybody who will thoroughly
understand this play will get far towards an
understanding of Ireland ; for the Geoghegan
family is Ireland in miniature. If you will
consider it fairly, all the dividing and dis-
cordant matters in the play are things of
foreign origin; and it is just when, after all
the misunderstandings, deceptions and pas-
sionate trickery, the really Irish feelings and
ideas win through that everybody is satisfied
and happy. The whole- is in a setting of
sparkling fun, and under the surface every-
body is wonderfully decent to everybody else.
Robinson, without dabbling in politics, has
rendered a big service to his country in writ-
ing just such a play. As the Irish Players,
with their perfectly finished naturalistic
acting and their melodious speech, carry “The
White-headed Boy” to the ends of the earth
they are not merely rousing Irish enthusiasm
for things loved and remembered, but show-
ing the world what Ireland is.
Irish literature in the English tongue lives
and moves. All the hard lights and bitter
imaginings of the earlier years of the so-
called Celtic renaissance are giving place to
something sweeter and truer. James Stephens
may be said to have turned the tide; and
now, with such writers as Lennox Robinson
behind the Irish theatre, we mav. look for
things at once greater and more joyous.
DAVID MCKEE WRIGHT.
A Word for the Defence
-“S.M.” (R.P. 20/4/’22) attacks what he
■calls the new American culture. His view-
point seems to me narrow and his method
unfair. Only such aspect's of the subject
as coincide with "S.M.’s” preconceived ideas
are attacked. No one deplores the present
rage for “jazz art” in all its forms more
than the cultured American, nor are such
productions truly representative of the art
of the nation. All nations have had their
periods of so-called “free art,” and the whole
world seems to be passing through such a
period at present. That this tendency is
more worldwide than solely American is
acknowledged by “S.M.” when he says “Civil-
ised countries are setting their standard to
that of the new exemplar, and the more civil-
ised the country the more complete seems
to be jts surrender.” All the vaunted ability
in advertising of the nation under discussion
could not sell things that did not appeal to
the customer.
Walt Whitman is by no means as univer-
sally accepted as “S.M.” seems to imply.
Conflict still rages over his true position in
the history of poetry and even over his
possible inclusion in such a history. It is
surely a gross exaggeration to call him the
"Shakspeare of the States.” Vachell Lind-
say, thank Heaven, is not the true represen-
tative of modern American poetry. In spite
of the seeming popularity of his “jazz muse,”
the older true spirit of poetry is growing
in its usual way. Bizarre effects always
catch the eye, and so it is that Lindsay
receives more publicity than the true poets.
Strange as. it may seem, there are other
writers in the lI.S. than Phillips, Chambers
and Hughes. I need only mention that
“Main Street,” by Sinclair Lewis, was one
year’s best-seller to prove that point. The
writer of thrillers achieves an easy and pass-
ing popularity with the man in the street,
and one does not expect that De la Mare
will sell when Oppenheiip is on the stand.
Yet the culture of present-day England is
surely not represented by the latter. As for
magazines, I should like to suggest that
“S.M.” try the Atlantic Monthly, the
Outlook, Scribner’s or the World’s
Work. Surely they will compare favorably
with any published anywhere, Simplified
spelling was a fad; was never taught any-
where that I know of; and is at present
only partly alive in one magazine.
jazz music did not originate in the States
—though that country is certainly guilty of
giving it its greatest impetus. However,
it is not troubling the coincident develop-
ment of real music. I heard a concert by
Madame Clara Sirena recently. About half
the songs were by American composers, and
not one of them so much as verged on jazz.
It might be pertinent also to call attention
to the fact that the Metropolitan Opera
House is crowded every night during the
season, and that Mary Garden’s Chicago
Grand Opera Company actually makes
money.
True it is that the “revue industry” is all
to the fore at present. But, then, the Ameri-
can public still patronises the acting of
Maude Adams, goes to see plays by Barrie
and productions staged by David Belasco.
The growth of the Little Theatre movement
throughout the larger cities of the United
States in recent years is remarkable. These
theatres put on onlv the best of the modern
plays, including Shaw and Dunsany, and
are playing to packed houses.
In conclusion, I might point out that
where thei'e is a demand a supply follows.
If the majority, or, at least, a strong minor-
ity, in this country did not find that this
"jazzed art” filled their demands it would
not be possible for it to survive. The acci-
dent that some of it is imported from the
.States is no argument that the deterioration
in standards is entirely in that country. I
am sure that.“S.M.” does not judge of the
quality of beer by the taste of the foam,
and no more should the quality of American
art be judged by its jazz stepson.

A Satchel of Books
The Victorian Municipal Directory (Arnall and
Jackson, Melbourne). This publication, now in its
57 th year, has swollen to 784 pages, but it still re-*
mains a slim volume taking up little space on a
reference book-shelf. The information is reliable, and
is up-to-the-minute on municipal affairs.
In the latest volume of the Historical Records 6}
Australia (series iv. vol 1.), the editor leaves the
oulsettlements to give the legal 1 papers from 1788
l ill 1827. They are for the most part dry enough,
though there are some interesting patches, such
as the discussion of 'Governor Darling's attempt to
control the press, and Jeremy Bentham’s 1803 plea
for a Constitution for A. S. Wa.es.
The Great Imaae, by “Pan” (Odham’s Press), tells
of tremendous events that happen in England a
hundred years hence. There is no reason for the
date, as it is the England of to-day, with arrogant
profiteers, soulful revolutionaries and all the other
ingredients that go to produce national upheavals.
The yarn is unconvincing, because the writer fails
to create tin* bizarre atmosphere of an advanced
period* but there is plenty of action in it, and of
that commodity known to careful parents as “healthy
sentiment,”
The Grey Room, by Eden Phiipotts (Hurst and
Blackett). in this novel Eden Phiipotts drops Ids
chosen rfde as a west country historian for a little
adventure in detective fiction. Though improbable,
the yarn is ingenious and keeps rhe reader clamlrer-
ing breathlessly over corpses to reach a highly sensa-
tional conclusion. Tin? opening chapters are cluttered
with ponderous spiritualistic talk, but this won't
damp the amateur Sherlock Holmes once he gets his
nose on the scent.
Mountain Blood, by Joseph Hcrgesheimer. (Uein§-
iiiaiin). This is an early work by Uncle Sam's finest
storyteller, but it is a capital study of West Vir-
ginian life, full of the drama and brutality that a
lesser performer would Shrink from painting. The
biggest figure in the yarn is a curious mixture of
loutishness, avarice and chivalry, and the author
presents him with relentless veracity. Ihe other
characters are also carefully etched. The farmers,
who creep into the tale at intervals to provide the
supers for a wedding and a funeral, have almost the
reality of photographs. In their passion for the soil
they recall Shelia Kaye-Smith’s Sussex yokels.
The Trembling of a Leaf, by W. Somerset Maugham
(Heincmann). Half-a-dozen tales of the South Seas
of which the publisher remarks on the wrapper:
“They are not meant for the delicate-minded; they
are strong stuff, with the bite and the sting of the
uncannily dear reader of hearts. are haunt-
ingly, damnably, bitterly true to life.” That is
irritatingly cheap, and not Quite fair to Maugham,
whose work isn’t in need of that picture-show sort
of boost. Though the stories have drab motives—
mostly unhappy brown-and-white tangles—they are
not as shocking as the wrapper suggests; and they
are well written, with the Pacific color admirably
caught.
Love and Unlove, by Harold Child (Duckworth &
Co.). A reprint of a series of articles contributed to
the Women’s Supplement of the London Times, in
which the author, like so many before him, seeks
to point the road to happiness, and particularly to
tell Man and Woman how they can tramp that road
side by side in amity. His frank discussion of the
relations of the sexes discloses a few ideas that would
be distinctly useful if the old Adam and old Eve that
persist in the race would let them be put into prac-
tice. But in the present generation there have been
more books written to show Jim and Jemima how easy
it is to rub along together than in all the other
generations since printing was invented, yet the
proportion of satisfactory marriages is appreciably
less than when He dealt with Her with a club ; and
it’s difficult to see what the Harold Childs are
going to do about it in the long run.

may be right about there being no doubt that
the soil and climate of the N.T. are suitable

N.T. produces bugs (in the American sense)
which will convey the pollen from flower to

Ceylon it was found that there were no
Ceylonese insects that would undertake this
essential of fertilisation, and the difficulty
had to be got over by putting on coolies with
camel-hair brushes to stud-groom the flow-
ers. There are no coolies in the N.T., and

“Hoppy” : All sugar-growers in the North
are not millionaires. Recently at Giru, up
Townsville way, a cocky, pressed for pay-
ment of a six-months’ old account, sent along
three kangaroo pups in lieu of the £3 owing.
Good hunting-dogs being at a premium in
the district owing to most of the cockies
being compelled to pursue the ’roo or wal-
laby for their dinner, the tradesman accepted
the whelps in full discharge of the bill. I
have not heard of the knights of the jam
industry sending along a few motor-cars to
settle their scores at the grocer’s, so pre-
sume that they are not short of dough.
“F.C.” : Just now Mulgrave, outside Mel-
bourne, is alive with cabbages. Also they
are ripe and must be cut. So the growers
go in with their 40- and 50-dozen loads —and
are lucky if they can get Is. a dozen for
them. Some have sold as low as 3d. a dozen.
(Incidentally, you can’t buy one decent cab-
bage in a greengrocer’s for less than 4d.) I
know one of four gardening brothers who on
Easter Monday went out mushrooming with
his family. They struck a patch, and re-
turned from their outing with 4% cases.
These a brother took to market and sold at
225. a case, netting for him more than his
three brothers got for their three loads of
cabbages.

The usual discomfort of those who inter-
fere with Nature, and especially with her
water-levels, is beginning to be felt or sus-
pected in S.A. The first and lowest of the
river locks, at Blanehtown, is now doing
its work. An immediate result is that the
river above, which in theory should be pushed
back right up to the next lock under con-
struction, is in fact overflowing its banks
in places instead, and flooding lands out at
the side. Down below the river promptly
dropped a foot and a half, and it is feared
that there may not be enough of it to keep
the salt water from coming in from the
mouth, spoiling that end for irrigation and
killing the Murray cod.
“Trevdee”: It has come at last. We have

like a purchaser. If Billy happens to step
into a tram and see an outrage upon himself
in the form of a “Billywog” being caressed
or scolded by its juvenile possessor, his
language may cause a derailment.

market. Many were keen to make the first
purchase in the new place. Particularly so
was one Moss, who claims to have attended
the first fish market ever bold in Adelaide—
on the pavement outside Trinity Church—
and the five-pofinder was eventually knocked
down to him for £22 10s.

BUBBLER' Demonstration by DANES at SYDNEYQOYAt SNOW
The “Bubbler” is a small, patent wool-
scouring- plant, invented by a West
Australian wool-classer, for home
scouring low grade, dingy, dusty wool,
bellies, pieces, stained pieces, locks or
dead wool. You can scour in the quiet
time after shearing, at a cost of about
ljd. per lb. (on the clean wool).
The saving effected will more than
justify the cost of the plant in one
season. The outfit is worked in con-
junction with any ordinary windmill
water supply. Expert labor is not
necessary—-any novice can work the
plant. Follow the simple directions
and mistakes are impossible.
You will be surprised at the results.
No matter how hard the water is, you
can take at least 95 per cent, of the
dirt out of the wool, and make market-
able what otherwise would be waste
product.
The smaller size “Bubbler” has a
capacity of 5 bales a day, and the
larger size a capacity of a bale an
hour. These plants are already in-
stalled and giving complete satisfac-
tion on some of the largest holdings in
Western Australia, including Austin
Downs, Mulga Downs, Boolardy, Yar-
rabubba, Yowergabbie. Burbina, Wad-
gee, Glenburg, Rio Tinto, Yalgoo and
other stations.

“Randolph Rentless”: It was a Redfern
(Sydney) council-meeting. Controversy had
waxed hot over a drain or something, and
hard words were flying to and fro. Finally
one Bumble (hurled the retort discourteous
at another and drove it home with ;a, quota-
tion which, later, he proceeded to inform
his opponent by way of crushing him utterly,
he’d “got from Shakspeare.” The assailed
alderman snorted derisively. “Shakspeare V”
he countered. “I bet he ain’t a ratepayer.
I know everybody in Redfern, an’ I never
’ea,rd of ’im. An’, anyway,” lie added, in
the stunned silence that followed the remark,
“’e ain’t got the of Redfern at
’art.”
“Wharehunga”: At Wharehunga Bay, in
Queen Charlotte Sound, M.L., is to be seen
all that was ever found of Midshipman
Clarke and his party, murdered by the
Maoris during Cook’s second visit to those
parts. The relics are the rusted remains
of two muskets, barrels, trigger-guards, etc.,
an old pistol-barrel, two three-cornered bay-
onets and a piece of rusty iron, probably
midshipman Clark’s hanger. When Cook
visited the spot after the murder be found
a. small piece of ground recently dug up and
described it as being “to the left of tiv>
middle spur of the bay.” This is the exact
spot where long afterwards the above relics
came to light after a landslip. Careful dig-
ging failed to produce anything more.
“M. 0.”: Victoria Barracks, Melbourne,
is getting more like a tomb every day. Its
depressed inhabitants move about the long
corridors like ghosts dwelling on the Order of
the Sack. In the vital years of war, and
for Some time afterwards, corridors, offices
and parade-grounds hummed with activity;
typewriters clicked incessantly ; clerks with
huge bundles of correspondence scurried
impressively into and out of the haunts of
self-opinionated military bosses; temporary
wooden huts sprang up like mushrooms all
over the vacant yards, and workers were
drafted into them like cattle. But now—
Look into the room of that high officer, bril-
liant on the field of battle. He is yawning
over an article about the armaments of
Heligoland. Elsewhere, another famous war-
rior is committing to paper yards of his war
memoirs. He has nothing else to do. _ They
are all waiting, waiting to learn their fate
from Hughes or Massy Greene. To-
morrow or the next day the saddened naval
crowd frOm Lonsdale-street will be thrown
into the same tomb. In one of the melan-
choly corridors I met a spectre, that of a
man who helped to make the name of the
A.I.F. ring throughout the world. He
whispered to me, before he glided into the
shadows, that Australia would rue the day
its fool-Government slashed so ruthlessly at
the navy and the army. And, for my part,
I believe him. Rarely has there been a
more conspicuous example of the overdoing
of a good thing than the Hughes Govern-
ment’s economies on the Defence side.
“Sucre”: Atherton (N.Q.) is such a ter-
ribly healthy spot that only three patients
were treated at the local hospital one year.
They were the doctor, the undertaker and
the monumental mason.
“T.W.” : Nothing astonishes me more than
the swindling charges the lollyman keeps up,
even with the sword of the Cadbury combine
suspended above liis head by one thread.
To-day I paid 3s. Bd. for a tin containing
six ounces of unskinned almonds with a
thin veneer of chocolate. The confection,
which thus costs nine shillings per lb. for the
person who eats it, costs the manufacturer
roughly Is. 6d. for almonds, a smear of
chocolate and sugar and the labor. ■ Its pre-
sent orice in London or Paris to the con-
sumer would be 45., and chocolateers
would not dare offer to people paying that
price almonds with their underwear still
on them. At ss. 9d. per lb. chocolates a,re
sold in Melbourne which would be stocked in
England for 35., and even then the people
would require more chocolate and less raisin
or other fruit interior. When the Tasmanian
outfit is ready Australia’s old-time lollyman
will be in for the rattling good bump that
he so richly merits.
“Hecagus”: Tell Barwell and his crowd
that the other day I met Archibald
McGregor, a N. Queensland resident whose
years number 87. He was on the way to
town to buy a pit-saw, and was looking for
a mate to work the other end of it with him.
“Gustavus Gravelpit” on a lost job:—
“Porky” Biles, rat-catcher of Sydney, has rejoined
the unemployed. He explained the position as fol-
lows : “There’s nothin’ in rats. Nothin’! Look at
me! Chucked out o’ my hotel yestiddy an’ broke
to the wide. Old Shakins, down in York-street, took
me on permanent when the scare started to catch
rats on his premises—said : e’d got a lot. Eight-
pence an ’ed wos ’is price. The first night I only
got two. ’Ardly wot you’d call layin’ the founda-
tion of a compertence. But next night things wos
diff’rent. Forty wos the tally—twenty-six-an’-eight-
pence worth. The number grew ev’ry night. An’
then the perishin’ caretaker queered me pitch. Yer
see they weren’t old Shakins’s rats at all —’is pre-
mises wasn’t ’arf stocked up. I used to ’op down
to the wharves an’ ketch ’em there. Then I’d drop
me sack over the back wall o’ Shakins’s warehouse
an’ afterwards present meself to the caretaker at
ther front an’ settle down fer the night. I should
’a’ been in that steady job now an’ doin’ well if the
blarsted caretaker hadn’t taken a screw round the
buildin’ night ’fore last, soon after ’e let me in
an’ found me well asleep usin’ me blinkin’ sackfull
of rats as a piiler.”
DIPSOS ALL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Professor Read pointed out that... .the simplest
alcohol of all is water, which could be called hydro-
alcohol.”
Where now the Rabelaisian pride
That fed upon the grape’s red juice
And milk-and-water’s lure defied?
Contrariwise, what is the use
Of umpteen years’ abstention now?
Or of that stark Blue Ribbon vow?
Now every pump’s a boozing-shop
No legal threat the drunkard follows;
No tippler shuns the frowning cop
When alcohol each baby swallows;
Beer, gin and rum I no more treasure
Since at my tap I take my pleasure.
But to the next who speeches makes
For Prohibition will I go,
Ask him if alcohol he takes,
And, when he smugly answer “No,”
“Lies ! Hydro-alcohol you drink!”
I’ll shout —and laugh to see him shrink.

P«CQ
J. N. McKenzie, secretary of the Vie.
branch of the Returned S. and S. League,
who seems to have had an unacted playlet
plagiarised in Paris, used to dabble in jour-
nalism and stage business before he went
to the war. In vaudeville he appeared as
Ashby, of Ashby and Glair.
From a specialist in Ritualism: —
The opposition to the individual communion cup
does not come, as suggested in last week’s Bulletin,
i'rom the conservative section of Anglicanism, but
from the A.C.U. High Churchmen argue that many
of those who are behind the individual-cup move
have shown little respect in the past for some of
the deep-rooted traditions of the Church, and have
always pandered to outside Nonconformist influ-
ences. In answer to the long list of medical testi-
monies, A.C.U. members insist that wine is a strong
antiseptic, and drive home their point by indicat-
ing the fact that clerics are usually long-lived,
though as regards communicating they stand a
greater chance of infection than anybody. But,
granting that the common chalice is a germ-breeder,
surely the easiest way out would be to administer
the wafers dipped in the wine.
“Bill o’ Costs” : We have a saying in the
profession that one should never argue with
the beak when he is delivering or has deli-
vered judgment. It does no good, for he is
not likely to change his mind at that stage;
fie dislikes being interrupted or told that
he is wrong, and he may say something
nasty. On the same principle whenever I
see that a Judge has “expressed himself
strongly” regarding an unexpected verdict
I wonder why some juror hasn’t exercised
his undoubted right. In such circumstances
an annoyed jury would be quite justified in
telling his Honor (12 times) to mind his
own business and record the verdict. Like-
wise an indignant acquitted person might
fairly seize the opportunity to tell the occu-
pant of the Bench how fortunate he is to
be sitting there in spite of his senility,
incompetence and partiality. True, these
things might be construed into contempt of
court. But snarls at a jury’s finding and
uncomplimentary remarks addressed to an
acquitted man are also a form of “contempt,”
and hence in registering a protest a wronged
party would in practice be quite safe from
commital.
“Herodot” suggests that most Biblical
miracles will be explained sooner or later:
Tlie description, in the second book of Kings, of
the way in which the Angel of the Lord smote the
Assyrian host during the night and killed over a
hundred thousand of them while they slept, has
always ranked with the supernatural'. Recently
bacteriological and archaeological researches, carried
out in the district where the smiting took place,
point to the annihilation of the Assyrians having
been due to an outbreak of cerebral malaria. The
part of the Jordan Valley where they camped on
the eventful night has, for ages past, been known to
be a hotbed of this type of the disease, as many
of the medical-officers who served with the Light
Horse in Palestine can testify. Once an outbreak
started, especially in a period when even the rudi-
ments of sanitary science were unknown, the death
roll would be tremendous. Probably many other
similar incidents described in the Bible can be
explained as due to such causes—a French chemist
recently read a paper before a scientific society in
Paris, in which he explained the manner in which
several noted miracles were performed and accom-
panied his explanation with an ocular demonstra-
tion. Yet, even in these enlightened days, many
churchmen object to such explanations being put
forward. When the scientists who have found the
solution of the destruction of Sennacherib’s host in
cerebral malaria returned to London a number of
clergymen, including “Gloomy Dean” Inge, fiercely
denounced them as atheistic meddlers.
“Dido” : As a result of flat life the women
of Melbourne suburbs like St. Ivilda are
being weaned off cookery, and confectionery
businesses are taking on an almost incred-
ible value. Many of these in the smaller
business centres are more profitable concerns
than large shops run in the city, inaccessible
to the flat-keeper when in need of a hasty
lunch or materials for afternoon tea. The
flourishing condition of scores of small dress-
makeries implies, too, that there is no room
for a sewing-machine in the ordinary flat.
What is wanted, now, is a creche in every
street to meet another long-felt want among
flat inhabitants, there being no objection to
children for tenants if they are farmed out.
“Tonsor”: I was shaving a small, rest-
less sort of bloke a few days ago when all
of a sudden he seemed to develop blue
funk. The job was nearly finished, but he
whispered fiercely: “Lather me again.
Quick, quick! Put it on thick all over.
Don’t be frightened. It’s half-a-quid in your
pocket if that chap who has just come in
doesn’t recognise me. He’s my tailor. I
owe him £25. and he’ll get it out of me if
he has to stick a week.” Well, an easy
half-quid looks as good to me as to any
man. I lathered my patient thick and slab,
and kept him so that his mother wouldn’t
know him, monkeying about pretending to
shave him till the newcomer had had his
quick trim and left. I got the half-jim all
right, and when my man had gone I said
to Ned at the other chair. “Who was the
big chap you were chatting so affable?”
“Oh. him,” says Ned, “he’s Clowson, the
detective!”
QUERY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I dearly love the footlights’ glare,
I love the actor life.
Some day, with long and loving care,
I'll issue from the strife
An actress great who can command
A wonderful reward,
Whom all the greatest in the land
Will worship and applaud.
Meanwhile I’m counted only fair,
But wedded to my art.
1 just adore the folks who stare
At me from every part.
I love the players, never shirk
Rehearsals by the hour,
For I’m devoted to my work,
And know my growing power.
Should any rich man come to me
With diamonds to give,
And beg of me in luxury
As his dear wife to live,
Should he have gold to grant each whim,
A’.id motors black as ink,
Would 1 go forth and marry him ?
Say, girls, what do you think?

Q. What is Threaded Rubber Insulation?
A. A storagejaattery insulating material made
up of rubber pierced with thousands of tiny
threads.
Q. How does it differ from other battery
insulation?
A. Ordinary insulation is wood, cut in the form
of thin sheets, and is neither as uniform nor
as durable as Threaded Rubber Insulation.
Q. Why is insulation so important?
A. Because battery life depends largely on in-
sulation and because any defect or weakness
of insulation is quickly evidenced by buckled
plates, short circuits, failure of the battery
to hold its charge and so on.
Q. What has this insulation to do with
battery shipment?
A. The kind of insulation determines whether
the battery must be kept wet, or can be
shipped in “bone dry” condition. Wood
insulation must never be allowed to dry out,
hence makes necessary wet or partially wet
shipment. With Threaded Rubber Insula-
tion the battery can be shipped absolutely
“bone dry.”
Q. Why is “hone dry”shinmerit preferable?
A. Because it is the only method by which
chemical action in the battery can be
entirely held up, so that thelbattery reaches
the buyer in truly brand new condition.
Q. Why does wood insulation need to be
replaced?
A. Because wood insulation, being soft, wears
out more rapidly than any other part of the
battery. It is also subject to cracking and
checking, which, if allowed to go too far,
seriously damages the battery.
Q. Why does Threaded Rubber Insulation
last the life of the plates?
A. Because the basis is hard rubber which
resists wear and does not crack or check.
Q. How can I be sure my battery has
Threaded Rubber Insulation?
A. Look for the red Thread-Rubber trademark.
It can be found only on the Still Better
Willard Battery.
Q. How many makes of cars and trucks are
equipped with Threaded Rubber Insu-
lation?
A. 191 use Willard Threaded Rubber Insu-
lation.

“A Little Dutch Girl,” now at Melbourne
Majesty’s, makes a commendable try to look
like a real comic opera rather than a musi-
cal nondescript, though the ellort is not
strong. It might seem stronger if the hero-
ine (llene Maxwell) had more dramatic
talent and personal magnetism ; if, in short,
her qualifications extended further than a
trained singing-voice and pleasing appear-
ance. In the educated warble of Miss Max-
well there is a vexatious tremulous tone
which is not always quite true, nor is it
laden with natural sweetness. The plump
lady is only negatively satisfactory as a
young Grand Duchess, betrothed to a foreign
Prince who (being somehow unaware of her
pretty face) needs to be pursued and brought
to the matrimonial scratch by the ancient
"She Stoops to Conquer” device of a wait-
ress’s disguise. Claude Flemming, as the
Prince, is another weakness, insofar that he
has a double chin and a weighty middle-aged
manner unsuited to a bachelor Heir Appa-
rent. But Flemming is at least magnetic, so
he lends a measure of personal interest to
the prima donna when they meet. Incidental
to the main love affair is the mutual attrac-
tion of George Gee, as the Prince’s factotum,
and Gracie Lavers, as the Duchess’s ditto.
Their duets and dances are the most
applauded features of the show, next to a
grotesque joint leg-shake by Hugh Steyne
and Gee aforesaid.
♦ * * *
Of the three comedians Gracie Lavers
alone is spontaneously droll. Though a trifle
light and skimpy for the character, she goes
at her task with a gay abandon and a deli-
cate sense of humor that mark her for
future distinction in soubrette parts. You
notice that in her duets with Gee it is the
man whose strenuous extravagance seems to
be straining after cheap larfs, whilst the
nimble lady seems to laugh at herself. Gee,
with his frequent trick of stumbling over his
own legs, is amusing only to those who enjoy
practical jokes. He has cured himself to a
large extent of certain unpleasant tricks of
mock effeminacy, but his fun-making will
never be genial. The exertions of Steyne, as
the Lord Chamberlain, are less apparently
strenuous, and his style has broadened some-
what since he last appeared in Melbourne.
But in such a fat part no practised comedian
could fail. All five parts aforementioned are
fuller of acting chances that the music is
of merit or the dialogue of wit. There is a

fair amount of glitter in “A Little Dutch
Girl,” and a sufficient quantity of J.C.W.
girl, but no items of attractive novelty in
song, dance or story.
Humphrey Bishop’s bright little co. will,
for another week at least, justify its coming
to Melbourne King’s at a time when the city
was already supporting more vaudeville than
usual. Local recollections of many panto.
Dames are paling before Joe Brennan’s ver-
sion of the merry old soul whose husbands
are no more. Also Sunshine James has
awakened society’s slumbering affection for
ventriloquial deceptions, and the waning
glories of jazz get a fillip from the clever
tumultuousness of Bert Crawford in the
orchestra.
** * *
At Melbourne Town Hall the violining of
Seidel and the excellent accompaniments of
Frank Hutchens have gathered favor as they
rolled along, therefore one more extra con-
cert is ordered for Saturday. Last week
Grieg’s Sonata in C Minor, Max Bruch’s
Concerto in G, and Paderewski’s Minuet
once again were leading features in the inevi-
table “furore,” and at the Thursday matinee
a charmingly refined treatment of the
“Kreutzer” Sonata made an almost crowded
audience feel good. In its tenderest moments
the performance was beautiful.

Though the Sistine Choristers sang with
all their previous enthusiasm at Melbourne
Princess’s on Saturday, they soon proved
that the theatre isn’t suitable for the produc-
tion of fine polyphonic effects. The Choir
was right enough
in the moderate
passages, but when
urged to lusty for-
tissimos by the
quivering conduc-
tor the proportion
of clamor to pure
music was almost
alarming. The
best thing of the
evening was the
soft openng t o
Perosi’s “Benedic-
tus,” and there
was fine feeling in
Vittoria’s Ave
Maria. Viadana’s
“Exultate Justi,”
Palestrina’s “Exul-
tate Deo,” and
other now familiar
items completed a
programme which
was received with
such fervor that it
w a s practically

with all the en-
cores, the first part
lasted only 40
minutes, and the
whole show was
over a little after

According to Anna Q. Nilsson, at Mel-
bourne Majestic this week, the reason “Why
Girls Leave Home” is the Purityranny of
their parents. The argument is elaborated
in seven reels. At the same theatre Alice
Calhoun appears in “The Matrimonial Web”
and, womanlike, plays both the spider and
the fly. Hoyt’s is affording a peep into
“The House without Children,” and hopes to
benefit both the census and box-office. But
Hoyt’s big item in public estimation is Marie
Prevost in “A Parisian Scandal.” Marie,
whose morals are English and behavior
French, flirts audaciously with a young col-
lector of fossils, eventually succumbing to
his superior charm. Bolsheviks, plain and
assorted, prevent Emmy Wehlen perishing
from boredom in Hoyt’s third attraction,
“Lifting Shadows.” Marion Davies, in “The
Bride’s Play,” is causing an increase of
population at the Melba. The Britannia has
“The Easiest Way,” in which Clara Kim-
ball Young is a sort of vaudeville Camille.
*!' $ v
At Adelaide Royal is a gentle and charming
comedy of “The First Year” of married life
in the U.S.A. There is no particular import-
ance in the ending, of happiness for the wife
with one anticipated infant, of triumph for
the husband with one successful gamble
(which, by Yankee stage standards, proves
him to be a first-class man of business). The
cleverness lies in the domestic details, and
every husband who has been sooled off the
premises just at tne moment he thought .he
was being a domestic heip can appreciate
them. Marjorie JBennett's hysteria-work is
admirable. IShe shares the burden of the
play with Phillips Xead, a delightful Ameri-
can youth who gets his effects without over-
acting. Maggie Moore, Edwin Bryant, Wil-
liam Greene and other clever people fill in
the corners of an artistic little show. Melo-
drama at the P. of W'. takes on a Scotch
aspect this week, which gives the old effects
an agreeable air of being different. At
West’s, Otis Skinner shows Oscar Asche
how to play “Kismet,” with effects of baths
and goats and other Asiatic details which
the stage never knew. At the York, Pris-
cilla Deane tastes the “Wild Honey” of
South Africa, and falls into the power of
various bad men and one raging flood.
Wondergraph shows life behind the scenes
of Broadway theatres: j ack Holt and Lila
Le.e work well in double harness. At the
Pav., “Over the Hill” continues to supply
the Good Cry which many women seem to
think the highest form of enjoyment.

Take an improper French farce concern-
ing a pretty lady and a henpecked humor-
ist who is not her husband ; also a supper,
with complications, at a swift hotel. Trans-
late into English for British, American and
“colonial” consumption, preserving as much
of the original as a public still devoted to,
and somewhat awed by the recollection of,
good Queen Victoria may be expected to
stand. Prepare again as a modern dish,
adding ballads and ballets, apache dances,
topical jokes and contributions from
the _ scene-painter and the costumier.
Garnish liberally with girl and serve. That
is how “A Night Out,” now at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney, was compounded, and the
“standing-room-only” audience that sampled
it on Saturday night was obviously pleased
•with the tare. It is not so filling as the
roast beef of English comedy, nor so art-
fully palatable as the productions of the
French, stage, but it is appetising enough.
There is such a mass of interpolations that
little remains of the original play, and that
little hasn’t been selected with uniform skill.
A particularly coarse specimen of French
farmyard humor might have been left in
the obscurity of the Gallic script. There is
also a depressing example of washstand-and-
ware wit. But for that there is prima
facie evidence that the English adapters are
to blame.
Joseph Pinglet, the rackety sculptor who
shins down from the room in which he has
been locked by his domestic tyrant to sup
with the gay Marcelle, is impersonated by
Alfred Frith. It is a character that gives
full scope to Frith’s energetic methods of
funmaking, and he has never done better
work—not in Australia, at all events. He
forms a considerable part of the show, and
nearly always an agreeable part. What
little singing he has to do is done admirably.
Maud Fane, as Frith’s accomplice at the
Hotel Pimlico, is by no means so impressive.
Whenever Maud is content to be her natural
self she is charming; but at times she in-
dulges in antics which are evidently intended
to amuse the people on the stage first, and
the audience as an after-thought; at other
times she conceals the sense of what she is
set down to sing or sneak in an extraordi-
nary hiss or squeak. These eccentricities get
easy laughs from some of her admirers, but
'fire tedious to those who don’t happen
to be in the joke. A genuine suc-
cess is registered by Madge Elliott,
as Victorine f the maid, and by Cyril
Ritchard as her calf-lover. Both sing well
and dance even better. In an age when
so many young actors and actorines mouth
their mother-tongue atrociously, Ritchard’s
fine enunciation is pleasant to dwell upon.
Another who makes a hit is Cecil Kellaway
as Matthieu, the country cousin, whose leg
begins to “stammer” when a trim-set craft
heaves in sight. His four daughters—Eve
Grey, Winnie Tate, Beryl Ferguson and ,
Mardie Andrews—have little to do except
look nice, and they do it right well. Others
who leave favorable impressions are Millie
Englei", Cecil Bradley, Addie Scott, Field
Fisher, Harry Wotton and Dan Agar.
The chorus work is unremarkable, but the
ballerinas shake their young limbs to some
purpose. And Jack Hooker and Rita
Nugent submit a thrilling version of the
dance popularly ascribed to the French larri-
kin and his tart.

“The Playboy of the Western World”
replaced “The White-headed Boy” at Sydney
Palace on Monday. A rather bored audience
listened to the unfolding of J. M. Synge’s
unpleasant play and vaguely wondered how
such a production could have raised a storm
of protest in Dublin and New York. The
acting was as fine as it possibly could be.
Sydney Morgan, J. A. O’Rourke, Arthur
Shields and Nora Desmond made all that
artists could of their parts: and Arthur Sin-
clair played with a skill worthy of the best
traditions of the Abbey Theatre. Nothing,
however, could redeem the bald inanity of
the play itself. The theme, the handling and
the dialogue are all of the poorest, though
individual lines have a superficial brilli-
ancy. “Harvest,” which had been rehearsed,
is in every way a better piece of work, both
from a literary point of view and as drama,
and it is hard to believe it would not have
hit the Australian theatrical taste more
forcefully than “The Playboy.”

At Sydney Tivoli Talbot O’Farrell and
the Two Rascals have been keeping their
ends up against allcomers. Amomrst the
last is Sam Stern, who scores with his Dago
and Yiddish character-sketches and is par-
ticularly bright as a broken-down opera
soprano selling “da banan’.” George Arm-
strong sings pleasantly and gets an extra
measure of applause, which may be related
to the fact that be left a leg in Flanders.

Charles Ray handles one of his popular
bucolic rffles at Sydney Haymarket this
week. Sharing the same sheet is a locally-
produced film entitled “Circumstance,” with
Yvonne Pavis, Lawson Harris and Carlton
Max in the star parts. It is not an outback
picture, but a heart-breaking story of a
fluffy kitten who is given the cold shoulder
by all the old cats. Of course all comes
right at the fadeout. Hoyt’s Australian
features “Cheated Hearts,” wherein the only
time the hero with the large swallow refused
the “Comeanaveone” invitation was when the
fluid was poisoned. The additional is

Jascha Spivakovsky’s recital in company
with the State Orchestra on Saturdav last
brought an audience to the Town Hall that
looked like a Conservatorium colony. The
programme included the Beethoven Fourth
Concerto, and the Tschaikowsky one in B-flat
Minor. Spivakovsky handled these two dis-
similar compositions with classic grace and
all the delightful abandon of the Slav. Skalski
conducted on the orchestral side, and after
each work the young pianist and the equally -
young bato.n-waver clasped hands in fervent
congratulation. Furthermore, they gener-
ously . insisted on the lesser musical lights
standing up to take their share of plaudits.
Spivakovsky demonstrates Mozart and
Brahms next Saturday with the orchestra.
The claim for £25,000 libel damages which
Sydney Sunday Times fired into ‘Smith’s
Weekly on Saturday does not constitute a
record. Levers asked the London Daily
Mail for £so,ooo—and collected the full
amount. The Mail had accused Levers’
61b. soap-bar of being under-weight.

POVERTY
POINT
From Charlie Kenninghr.m, who knew
him well: —
The lote Rutland Barrington (Rutland Barrington
Fleet), a Charterhouse boy, was more a personality
than an actor, and as Gilbert and subsequent authors
always “fitted” him, he was always “Barrington.”
For some reason or other he never liked Gilbert.
Not being communicative he never told me why.
But Sullivan certainly liked him ; to the composer be
was “Rutty.” Personally, Barrington was reserved.
He resented liberties or familiarities from gny but
his friends. I lived with him during the provin-
cial tour of “Jane Annie,” that unfortunate opera
written by Conan Doyle and J. M. Barrie, music
by Ernest Ford. The music was excellent, but “Jane
Annie” was the biggest failure ever produced at the
Savoy. As the company had to be kept together
for the new G. and 9. opera then being written, we
were sent on a “holiday” tour. Barrington, Scott-
Fishe (the very popular baritone), Ernest Ford, the
composer and conductor, and I were thrown together
for a most enjoyable time. The tour was entirely
successful, but I doubt if the eminent authors
would have recognised their work after a week or
two. Incidentally, Barrington was a good cricketer
and an enthusiastic golfer. He lost a lot of money over
the failure of his “Branksmere Hall,” but wrote
several successful curtain-raisers, generally in colla-
boration with Cunningham Bridgman. Mrs. Barring-
ton, a charming woman, was not an actress, and
there is no family. He was a good, helpful colleague
and friend—peace to his ashes !

“Wyman”: One misses Sara Allgood,
Eileen O’Doherty and J. M. Kerrigan from
the cast of the Abbey Players now in Syd-
ney. But Australian audiences are for-
tunate in seeing the Players at all, for
during 1911-12 the original Abbey Theatre
company was mostly touring outside of Ire-
land, and the theatre in Dublin was left to
the mercy of understudies. Gradually a
decljne set in until in 1916 the enterprise
languished. For nearly two years the Abbey
Theatre sheltered melodrama. Then Lennox
Robertson took over the management, and
good work was revived. The first produc-
tion of “The White-headed Boy” reunited
the original Players for the first time in
several years. Then it was that Maire
O’Neill created her delightful characterisa-
tion of Aunt Ellen. Maire, Arthur Sinclair,
Sydney Morgan and J. A. O’Rourke were
trained in the fine traditions of the brothers
F. and W. G. Fay, to whom full credit is
due for the rise and ultimate fame of the
Irish Theatre.
“Peter”: Tom Walls, whose melancholy
Peter Doody will be remembered in the first
Australian production of “The Arcadians,”
sCems to have struck a gold-mine in “Tons
of Money,” which he and Leslie Henson are
staging at the London Shaftesbury. The
piece, which was written by Arthur Valen-
tine and has been rejected by almost every
other manager in the Fog, is a commonplace
farce, but somehow it has touched the Lon-
doner’s funny-bone with an effect on the
advance booking- that is described as “tre-
mendous.” Another success, “The Faithful
Heart,” at the Queen’s, affords further
ground for cynical comment on the alleged
judgment of theatrical magnates. Accord-
ing to its author, Monckton Hoffe, the plnv
has had a wide circulation among managers
and Actor-managers, and has been declined
hastily and impolitely in almost every in-
stance.
“Norbell”: Roy Redgrave had the mum-
mer’s inevitable in.s and outs —a good many
outs —during the last few years, even to
storming in the Backblocks with Bob Holly-
ford under canvas. Ilollyford is Dan
Barry’s successor. Redgrave had a fairly
good spin with Charles King at the Bris-
bane Royal and
the Tivoli, six
years ago, playing
anything and
everything in
weekly changes of
bellowdrama. He
enlisted in Queens-
land in 11116. but
was turned down
on account of de-
fective eyesight:
he had seen active
service in the Boer
War, and after-
wards did journal-
istic work in South
Africa. He was
fine in costume
plays, and George
Musgrove engaged
him to play Buck-
ingham in “When
Knighthood was
in Flower,” but
Bilanderson held
him to an unfin-
ished agreement,
and J. B. Athol-
wood played the
Duke instead. My

lection of Red-
grave is as the

Gun,” at Sydney

“0.K.”: Harry Roberts was entertained
at Melbourne’s Greenroom Ciub the other
week “on the occasion of his 50th birthday.”
Humph! Maggie Moore’s husband un-
doubtedly started to learn the business at
an early age, but there was an H. R. Roberts
taking a young-man part in “The Merchant
of Venice” and an old-man part in “Gymbe-
lihe” when the late Essie Jenyns played her
fdrewell season in Melbourne 34 years ago.
I have the programmes. Youthful interpre-
ters of minor old-man characters were not
uncommon in Bill Holloway’s co., but a 16-
year-old Roberts in Shakspearean disguises
would have been a bit under the odds. Any-
how. Harry doesn’t look more than 50.
nevertheless and notwithstanding.
“T. 0.1.”: If “Orb” (B. l/6/’22) will
read my par. again he will see that I did
not call Tom Margetts- “a Dago.” I knew
Tom too well for that. Our acquaintance
began when he was apprenticed to a coach-
builder. We both took part in the “Penny
Readings” so popular in Melbourne in the
’sixties and after. Margetts came to Sydney
in the ’seventies under engagement to John
Bennett at the Victoria Theatre. Later,
I think, he sang at Spencer’s Museum, which
stood one door east of what is now the
Strand Picture Theatre. Spencer was a
mechanical genius, who added a miniature
concert-room to his show, in which his
daughter and a son usually sang, danced or
played. Tom Margetts was understood to
have been engaged to one of the daughters,
but he was a bit wayward and was not a
continued success on the stage. By a slip
of memory I gave Scott-street as the site of
the old Newcastle Theatre. It should have
been Watt-street.
“Boyce Rolls”: Mayne Linton, who roars
at the rest of the cast in “The Bat,” at Mel-
bourne Royal, is alleged to have put a big
Shakspearean career behind him. In Eng-
land he appeared in Bardic drama with
Forbes Robertson, Frank Benson and Oscar
Asche, and in the U.S. he was with Edward
bo them and Julia Marlowe. With the last-
named pair he did Laertes in “Hamlet,”
Tybalt in “Romeo and Juliet,” Oliver in
“^ s ,You Like It,” and Banquo in “Mac-
beth. ’ Judging him on his present acting,
one wouldn’t regard him as a very engaging
Tybalt or striking Oliver, and his Laertes
must have been a rather rough customer.
Oscar Asche apparently considered him an
excellent specimen of the muscular mummer.
At any rate, Asche made him Charles the
Wrestler in “As You Like It,” with himself
as Jaques, Henry Ainley as Orlando and
Lily Brayton as Rosalind.
“0.K.”: A new comedy by R. C. Carton,
reckoned one of the brightest of playwrights 25
years ago, was something of a theatrical
event in London last month. In “Liberty
Hall, ’ “Lord and Lady Algy,” “The Tree of
Knowledge,” etc., Carton showed himself a
brilliant writer of dialogue, and a clever
character sketcher, though there was always
a little something wanting in a Carton play
that_ prevented it from getting the multi-
tudes vote. “Lord and Lady Algy” was
effeminate in sentiment (the title betrays the
tact) and too classy altogether. The plot
radiated from the circumstance of a quarrel
between Algy and his wife on the subject of
cigarettes. He preferred Egyptian whilst
she swore by Turkish or vice versa. So
they parted. “The Tree of Knowledge” was
made of sterner stuff, and would be well
remembered in Australia had it not been
played under the management of Harry
Rickards. ’Arry never could get fair credit
for importing a capital comedy company
(Cartwright m control) and doing the thing
handsomely. There were a dozen good parts
m “The Tree,” and the co. had to be rein-
forced with local talent. Edwin Lester, for
instance, played a half-pay officer whose
daughter complained that his services had
not been properly recognised by his country.
“England is ungrateful,” said the girl. “No,
my dear,'’ said Lester“nat-ungrateful; Eng-
land -is--—er— busy.’ 1 ' Such lines are not
easily forgotten. Nor the little social gather-
ing of Dickenesque characters in “Liberty
Hall,” where the stodgiest guest was re-
garded by the lovable old host as a wag of
the first water. Unless long sickness has
robbed his touch of its former delicacy a new
comedy by Carton should be worth the
money.
“Nella”: “Blighty’s” reference (B.
l/6/'22) _ to John Deverell’s playing the
dummy piano on stage, while a real musician
did it “off,”, recalls how the Svengalis “made
music” on the piano in many Australian
productions of “Trilby.” Reuben Fax, .the
first Svengali here, counterfeited playing
very well, his every movement synchronis-
ing with those of the unseen player. Tyrone
Power, himself a good pianist, jibbed at the
“Rosemonde” of Schubert in public, and had
an obliging ghost off stage. Allan Wilkie,
whose Svengali had many striking and
original touches, wisely turned the back of
the piano to the audience to prevent mistakes
when he simulated piano-playing, his expres-
sive shoulder-shrugging being particularly
effective. But Gaston Mervale, a brilliant
piano-puncher, actually played the instru-
ment. His
It was lost, the bel canto, but I found it in a
dream—l and nobody else —I— Svengali— l — l—l!
was thoroughly convincing, and his music
a thing to remember. Nellie Stewart, the
Trilby in that show, had a trying ordeal.
Through a gauze she was shown actually
singing “Ben Bolt” in-the Cirque des Bashi-
bazoucks, while Svengali Mervale conducted
from the estrade in the orchestra. Nellie had
to stand there and mouth the ah-ah-ahs of
a highly florid number, and then do “Ben
Bolt” also in pantomime while the real
singers—there was one for each item —•
warbled out of sight. Nellie Stewart, mark
you, who was once Australia’s prima donna !
“Taloe”: Re “Sarc’s” query (B. 25/5/’22)
“Why don’t these imported piano-thumpers
introduce - some novelty into their pro-
grammes?” Guy Maier and Lee Pattison,
who perform shortly in Sydney, fill the bill
in this respect. Among modern compositions
which they play are Arnold Bax’s tone-poem
“Moy Mell,” which paints the capricious
moods of the mythical Irish “Heaven” situ-
ated somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean ; lljin-
sky’s “The Orgy,” a fascinating and dis-
tinctly unusual work which created intense
enthusiasm in the U.S., and E. B. Hill’s
“A Jazz Study,” sandwiched between com-
positions by Tailleferre, Duvernoy and De-
bussy. If that repertory can be beaten for
unusualness I should like to hear of its
conqueror.
“Thorold Waters”: When the Royal
Choral Society next lifts its multiple voice
at London’s Albert Hall, some other con-
ductor than Frederick Bridge will beat four
in a bar. Bridge was a good pal to have,
for an appearance as soloist with the Royal
Choral Society gave an impetus which was
sufficient to carry any singer of ordinary
capacity through many profitable .seasons.
Harry Dearth, now squandering his voice on
revue inanities, was an instance; on the
night that Bridge allowed him to sing
“Elijah” he wrapped not only the mantle of
the prophet around him, but also the singing

garb of Santley, Ffrancon Duvies and
Andrew Black. Ada Crossley, Esta D’Argo
and Mary Gonly are about the only Austra-
lians who ever sang under the old gentle-
man’s rather, jog-trot baton.
“Cornstalk'’: Mira Kenham, who played
the Bowery girl and the lady with the bad
head in the Sydney production of “My Lady’s
press,” and impersonates the wicked sister
in “The Lie,” is Delmira Brokenham on the
electoral roll. Her sister is a well-known
London actress, Jane Wood. Both Eily
Malyon and Mira Kenham were understudies
to Ethel Irving, but Mira had the better
luck ; in every instance .she got a chance to
go on vice the star. Miss Kenham also
understudied Gladys Cooper when that per-
sonable young woman did “My Lady’s
Dress.” She retires from the stage on June
24 to wed a M.L. sheepman whom she met
aboard the Orvieto coming out.
“0.K.”: Popular though it be, the per-
formance of “The Bat” at Melbourne Royal
is a remarkable instance, from my point of
view, of the art of how not to do' Tt. The
ingenuity and audacity of the plot carry
the matter through in spite of the miscar-
riage of the author’s intention, which is said
to have been thrillingly realised in a Paris
production. There the characters now played
in Melbourne by Emma Temple and Eliza-
beth Dunn were the reverse of matter-of-
fact. The elder woman was a bit of a
spiritualist with a superstitious Sherlock
Holmesian interest in mysterious happenings
and their causes, whilst her terrified com-
panion was a quietly humorous neurotic sub-
ject, not a loudly farcical exclaimer of My
Gawd! In the Melbourne show an unruffled
elderly spinster of the most English type
is associated with a shrill American retainer-
who screeches through her nose. The scene
admits of the young niece being almost as
English as her fiance, the bank clerk, whilst
the local doctor is rather American, and the
detective shouts at everybody in the most
bullying Ameriean-drama manner. Seeing
that the bank, whose director’s nephew is
so distinctly English (Kenneth Brampton,
in fact), has been robbed of a million dol-
lars, and the doctor was lately travelling
with its director in Colorado, the unnamed
district where all these contradictory people
abide is supposed to be American. The in-
consistencies of diction,: the solid British
imperturbability of Emma Temple and her
visitors amidst a rush-of wild alarms, and
the profound disrespect shown to corpses
that occur in her domicile, justify the use of
the term “mystery play” in all the ads.
“Lud”: “The Lie,” now being staged at
Sydney Criterion, is, in its printed form,
dedicated- enthusiastically to Margaret Illing-
ton, the American actress, who appeared in
the part now taken by Emelie Polini. The
piece has not been seen in London, though
it was obviously written for British con-
sumption. Jones, like Pinero, is looked
upon as a back-number in England these
days.
THE DANCERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The music is the cheaper kind:
Two flutes that ever shriller grow,
Three brasses, and away behind
A rasping violoncello.
Conductors bobbing to and fro,
The fiddlers fiddle all in line,
The cornet swells his cheeks to blow—
The dancers only are divine.
I to the singers am resigned,
The best soprano’s just so-so;
The tenor one would gladly find
A little billet with a hoe;
Contralto hints at settled woe,
And baritone is never fine.
I’d up from here, and off I’d go,
But find the dancers are divine.
Tlie play is witless, full of wind ;
The hero swells his chest to crow;
The story desolates the mind;
The bluff comedians are low.
All choruses are flat and slow—
They would not draw a bean of mine.
’Twould be a really hopeless; show
But that the dancers are divine.
Envoy.
The people dreadful yawns bestow
Behind their hands, and mewl and whine.
Into the street the crowd would flow
Were not the dancers quite divine.

magnificent races for its money. In the
A. 2000 Hurdle there were nine starters, and since
(he bookmakers offered 11 t 0 2 the field and a long-
P 1 med candidate rolled home, an enterprising punter
could have backed every one of them and shown a
1 robt. One of the favorites was the Victorian can-
d'date Jewel Song, and he cut out the pace from
Bailies Brakespear—Sopra gelding, Spear Song (12
o/l), with All Aboard prominent. The last-named
iooked a winner half-a-mile from home, but like the
other flat-racer, Ecarte (7’s), he faded over the las/
bit and, settling Jewel Song at the turn, Spear Song
ran home a winner by two lengths from Gold Snow
< ' s), with Ecarte a fair third. Montagne le Roi
came down when going well. It was his first fall
*nd Ins last; he injured a shoulder badly and the
yet. B bullet did the rest. For the First Steeple
12 jumpers were produced, and the Adelaide horse,
Haoma, was made favorite at. 5 to 2. Though
buroencd with list. 131 b.. the Persian Knight—
Windlass bay fenced beautifully, and he landed the
prize and some substantial bets for his owner, Flan-
nagan, after a grand race from the turn with
Warlock (14’s) and Sandridge (B’s), Taralie, Mon-
rose and Basil K. being prominent behind the placed
horses. 1
But good as Haoma’e race was to watch, the
£2OOO Steeple, run on Monday, was better. Most
of the 11 competitors bad started in the First
Steeple, and carried the same weights, but the Mel-
bourne grey Monrose (Tom Moore—White Rose) had
31b. more to hump, 12st. 71b. in all, over a journey
that was five furlongs further. This notwithstanding
he was backed down to 6 to 1 (Haoma was at 3’s,
Sandridge at 4’s and Warlock at 6*s), and he justi-
fled this support by leading all the way and shaking
off first Warlock and then Sandridge in a rousing
struggle up the straight. It was a splendid exhibi-
tion of skilful jumping, stamina and gameness, and
the crowd gave the grey and R. Connelly, who rode
him, a great reception. Haoma ran off—or, rather,
was pushed off- —at the last jump when looking
dangerous. The flat races were not specially interest-
ing. Popaway cakewalked one of the sprints, and
would probably have won another if he hadn’t re-
ceived a bump which settled liis chance. And War
Spear, who had run badly on the first day, sent
T. Mcßoolc home rejoicing by winning-the 12-furlong
Winter Stakes at 25 to 1 from the second favorite
Ulandra, Red Cardinal and Glen Branter dead-heating
for third.

Last year the Hurdle and Steeple on the
first day of the Birthday meeting at Flemington
pointed very closely to the results of the Nationals
four and five weeks later, but the form last Satur-
day was quite unillumiriative in the Hurdle, if
not in the tougher race. Eric Connelly’s King
Neptune, not entered for the National because his
owner is now persuaded that the half-brother to
Greenstead is no stayer, ran right away from Ama-
zonia, Master Avington, Well Off and others. Roisel
discouraged his early “double” backers by getting
a tumble, and of-the others only Master Avington,
the pacemaker, looked likely to have any sort of
say in the three-miles race. Monday’s hurdle was
more revealing. ; The finish was contested by
Bright Plume (9 to 2), Fiscoui (9 to 4) and Pistol-
ier (10’s), and the Plume beat the National top-
weight nicely in 4min. lTsec. for the 18 furlongs.
In Saturday’s Steeple (won by Mountain God
last year) the National pretentions of Truepenny were
silenced by a fatgl fall. - Also Gazomp lengthened
his price for the coming event by a blunder which
apparently did him no harm. On the other hand
it did him no good. The race for the last mile was
between Berribee, the favorite, and Silver Fox, the
outsider. Finally Berribee clouted a fence that
brought Gazomp to grief, and from that time tie
could make no show against Silver Fox, who won
easily. whilst the outsider was making the best
01 his way home, however, Mountain God was put-
ting in a run that brought him to Berribee’s heels
ere they passed the post, and on this run Mountain
God is bound to be warmly fancied for the National,
despite his 12st. 71b. Berribee (9 to 2) won
Monday s race over the big timber, but only three
ot the nine starters completed the course, and at
that tlie third horse (Wee Dook) baulked at one
obstacle. Among those who fell were Silver Fox
and the favorite Grand Fleet, and they were running
first and second at the time.

1 airy Bob shaped indifferently at Rand-
wick last October, but at the moment lie is the best
horse in Queensland. This the son of Bernard
Fairy Gold demonstrated by donkey-licking a w f.a.
flekl in the King's Plate at the Queensland Turf
Clubs Cup meeting—he covered the 10 furlongs in
Lnnn. fi.jsec.—and by running second in the Bris-
,? e with 9st. 101 b. aboard, to the four-year-
old Grichka, to whom he was conceding 181 b.
Grichka, who had won the Hamilton Handicap on the
nrst day of the meeting, was ridden in both races
by Albert Wood. He is by Syce—Number Four.
J n the Cup he went out at 12 to 1 (Fairy Bob was
favorite at 7 to 2), and he beat the topweight by
a length and a half in 3min. 26jsec., Demeranthis
being a couple of lengths away, third. Tile well-
endowed Stradbroke Handicap went to the second
favorite Laneffe (Linacre —Lanieve), who beat the
favorite, Gold Tie, by a length, with Admetus third.
And Ship, a chestnut grandson of Carbine, won the
St, Leger at 20 to 1.
* * * *
Hitherto unlucky in big races, Crusader
(I assmg By—Antrope) won the Adelaide Birthdav
Cup on Saturday from Annexit and Bookaloo. He
was ridden by Myles Connell, whose “forward”
methods suited the horse admirably, and paid £ 4
16s. on the £1 tote, King lngoda (another fourth)
being actual favorite. The 12 furlongs were cut
out in 2mm. 35sec. Adamant (Bock Flint—Saintly
Lady), one of the unplaced division in the Birth-
day, took the Alderman Cup on the Monday, Socrutea
being second and Annexit third. The winner paid a
dividend of £6 155., but his time 3min. 7ssec. for
l,i mile) was slow, even though the race was run in
heavy rain.

Considering that the English Derby course
is more than a trifle up hill and down dale, the
record time achieved by Captain Cuttle (2min.
31 .3-ssec.), in beating Tamar and Craigangower
suggests that he is one of the beat, on the day,
that ever did the trick. The win was easy, other-
wise the performance couldn’t be suspected of
special excellence. And seeing that the horse was
dosed with cocaine after a rail had been removed
from the coronet of one foot, the record performance
is not unlikely to encourage the drug habit among
owners. The Cap’n started at 10 to 1, and was
ridden by Donoghue. Frank Bullock, the Austra-
lian, was on Tamar, who also started at 10’s. St. Louis,
"h° out a 4-to-l favorite, gave his backers a
respectable run for their money, finishing fourth, but
* " oe i’ s mystery-colt Pondoland—second favorite
at 11 to 2 was never sighted. Whereat there was
lamentation in Whitechapel, where humble connec-
tions of the Joels still pursue the ancestral calling—

O.K. : Announcements of early doubles
picked for the Nationals are but ’ lures for
optimists. Last year’s winners of the two big
Hurdle races (National at Flemington and Austra-
lian at Caulfield) are said to have been confidingly
coupled with the winners of the two corresponding
Steeples, which supposes the probability of the pair
of Nationals going to horses heavily penalised for
their successes last winter. Fiscom, the National
Hurdle winner of 12 months ago, may, of course, be
credited with all the improvement claimed for him,
seeing that he was still a four-year-old when he did
the trick, and a jumper is a mere youth at that
age. But Shivander, who ran very prominently in
the same event, was only in his' fifth year, and
whereas Fiscom is raised 311 b. for winning a des-
perate race by a head (the third being only a neck
further back), Shivander is raised only 81b. for
running sixth. The 9st. 91b. candidate is preferable
on paper to Fiscom at list. 61b. As for Moun-
tain God. raised from list. 61b. to 12st. 71b. in
the Steeple, he looks a bad choice for the “second
leg” in a double bet. The God is a safer jumper
than of yore, but he has grown rather old whilst
learning the business. Gazomp, who won the four-
mile Steeple at Caulfield last year, is still on the
youthful side of the account, and should have a
great show with lOst. 111 b, but Roisel, who took
the Hurdle at Caulfield, was an aged animal when
he did it. He won very easily, it is true, and has
no more than lOst. 41b. to carry at Flemington, as
against his 9st. minimum at Caulfield. All the
same, Roisel is not a tempting proposition in the
light of the fact that he is placed within 161 b. of
the topweight in the National, whereas he was
receiving as much as 33, 35 and 41 lb. from the best
performers in the event he won last year.

“0.K.”: Touching Morley’s Totalisator
Bill (B. 26/6/’22), I am wondering what sort of
apologies some of the Vic. Labor members will
offer ior their opposition to an essentially democratic
measure. That a Tote Bill will have their hearty
support is not to be expected. There was a time in
Melbourne when Labor legislators. Federal and State,
used to foregather in honor of citizen Wren, pro-
prietor of the illicit Collingwood tote, and drink
the health of that favored lawbreaker in bumpers
of bubbly water. Then was the betting machine
praised by the members of the party to which John
Wren claims to belong. It was declared to “give
hope to the working-man.” Its presiding genius was
hailed as a benefactor of the suffering masses. But,
oh, what a difference when the Collingwood “joint”
was at last suppressed, and presently a strong demand
for a legalised totalisator in N.S.W. alarmed the
bookmaking forces in both N.S.W. and Victoria!
The same Labor politicians who had favored the tote
that Jack built were found on the side of book-
making when the tote was proposed for racecourse
purposes. Their sympathy was devoted to the pri-
vileged firm of Shortodds and Co., and their efforts
were directed to the maiming of the measure that
eventually passed into N.S.W. law after a scandalous
struggle. That bill permitted the operations of licen-
sed bookies to continue, and the old s.p. shoos to
flourish as before. What happened in N.S.W. will be
repeated in Victoria anon, if the intrigues of
Shortodds and Co. are successful. There will not
be a majority of the House in favor of legalising
the tote on condition that bookmakers are excluded
from the racecourse. The N.S.W. “concession” clause
will be battled for, and the tactics and names of
the battlers will be worth noting.

Adelaide has been the scene of a batch of
inter-Varsity contests. In the sports. L. V. Pellow
(Adelaide) just beat Hutton (Sydney) in the 100yds.
and 220yds., the latter in 22 1-5 seconds. Hutton
won the quarter, as a matter of course. But Mel-
bourne took nearly everything else, and won easily
on the day ; Almond did the hurdles in 15 4-ssec.
and Macmillan surprised himself by running the
mile on a damp grass track in 4min. 80 4-ssec.
Brisbane and Perth were represented also. In the
tennis there were only three teams. Sydney beat
Adelaide and Melbourne in turn ; but the play was
ruined by rain, and was abandoned in each case as
soon as a majority of rubbers had been won. Bris-
bane beat Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide in tne
boatrace.

“Smike”: L. V. Pellow, who won the
100 and 220 yards for South Aus. at the inter-Uni.
sports in Adelaide, is a brilliant successor to his
older brother “Pip,” the Australian cricketer, now
pushing a plough on an up-country farm. “Pip”
Pellew’s appearance for the University happened two
or three years ago, when he collared the 220 and
440 yards—the latter in sensational fashion. In
the last few yards of the sprint he had a breathless
struggle with L. H. Kelly, of Melbon rue, and got
home by half an eyelash, or something of the kind.

Thirty-five thousand people, mostly mugs,
invaded Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday to Wit-
ness the rout of the unscrupulously over-boomed
Maoris by a metropolitan team of Rugby Leaguers,
10 of them “Kangaroos.” It wasn’t a match; it
was a massacre. The Maoris were outclassed in
every department of the game. The tally, 77 points
(1/ tries 13 goals) to 13 points (3 tries 2
goals) wasn t a true reflex of the relative merits of
the contestants; apparently the S}’dney men could
have made it 177 to 13 had they been all out. Onlv
three of them omitted to trouble the scorer—Rule,
who stopped a boot with one of his eyes; Watkins
w'ho received his marching orders for paying coo
much attention to an opponent ;• and Rigney—and he
missed a chance. Burge, the giant from Glebe, raced
over the Maori line six times and hoisted 3 goals,
and Ilorder notched 3 tries and 3 goals. Tlio Maoris
were as draught horses alongside thoroughbreds
borne of them showed a fair knowledge of the game,
and they tackled like demons, but, as they admitted
their conquerors were “too bloomin’ clever.” Pitted
against a second N.S.W. team on Monday the visitors
made a somewhat better show, but were beaten bv
31 points (5 tries 8 goals) to 14 (2 tries 4 goals).
Uufty was their best player on both days, and B.
1 ak), the skipper, G. Gardiner and Maniapota were
also prominent. The Country Districts competition
produced much finer sport. North Coast, a reallv
clever combination with two excellent players, the
Quinleven brothers, walloped Southern Districts by
31 to 5; Western Districts slathered Northern Dis-
tricts by 20 to 3. and Newcastle narrowly defeated
a combined Country XIII—2B to 26. The Country-
men had bad luck. J. O’Shea, their winger, being
hurt shortly after the spell. 8

joke at Sydney Cricket Ground. If I had been
I would commence an action for the return of my
admission-money on the ground of gross misdescrip-
tion of the goods. And 1 would cite most of the
respectable” Sydney papers as parties to the offence.
Sending a delegation over to Maoriland to tooth-
comb that country for native amateurs who might
be induced to turn professional was a low-down
business at best. But when a sort-of-a-kind of a
side is collected, and its coming i s heralded by-
glaring misstatements (to put it mildly) as to its
prowess, individual and collective, and its mostly
mythical deeds “against the Springboks,” the thing
becomes an outrage. Still, the football public doesn’t
object. It is used to having its leg pulled by the
Rugby League.

N.S.W. had a lucky win over Queensland
in a Soccer match at Sydney on Monday The
Northerners had the better of most of the game and
T. Hainsworth (forward) was the finest player on
the ground. But when the scores were two all
a mis-kick by Queensland’s full-back into his
own net gave the Ma Staters their third goal and
the match.
* * * *
The Australian Soccer team in Maoriland
got their first cold blast of adversity when Welling-
ton defeated them by 3 goals to nil. Though Wel-
lington is the Soccer stronghold of the Dominion, the
defeat augurs ill for Australia’s chances in the
tests. However, some of the visitors may not
have stmek form.

About 60,000 persons distributed them-
selves between the two League matches in Melbourne
on Saturday—and got little for their money. It
is seven years since Carlton thrashed South Mel-
bourne on the latter’s ground, and as their position
is none too good the Old Blues were keen to spoil
the record. They kept their end up till lemon-time,
but South had better pace and more stamina and
ran over their opponents in the last quarter, win-
ning easily by 63 points to 35. For four years St.
Kilda have gone down regularly before Collingwood,
but having walloped South, who had just outed
’Wood, the Saints went out feeling good with them-
selves —and crashed horribly. Final tally: ’Wood,
104 points; St. Kilda, 35. Of ’Wood’s 18 men no
fewer than eight kicked goals, and no man more than
three. Even Dicky Lee managed only one. Tliev
are an even, matelike team, and all the plavers are
paid alike.
* * * *
“Coot”: Dick Lee, Collingwood’s veteran
goal-sneak, holds a record not only for “sixers” but
also for long service in the football field. He
just completed his 17th consecutive year of senior
football, and is still going strong. It is a coinci-
dence that J. Mcllale, whose record Lee has just
beaten, also played with Collingwood.
Seldom is Bert Spargo reduced to the
unpleasant necessity of knocking a man out. Like
most Australian pugs who have been trained in the
feather-pillow school, he would rather go 20 rounds
any night : the promoter expects it and the public
applauds it.. But at Melbourne on Saturday just
to show he hadn’t lost the old sleep-producer, the
crack featherweight delivered it in the tenth round
to Walter Ross, of North Britain. Ross had annoyed
the Victorian by weaving in from the start and
landing some nasty
punches on the com-
missariat department.
Twice the provoking
fellow was floored—-
in the fourth round
and the eighth—but
being somewhat thick
in the head, he con-
tinued his contuma-
cious behavior until a.
right to the body and
a left to the jaw sent
him down for the
count, an inert mass
of British beef.

Stanley Mcßride, wlio mc-t Vince Black-
burn at Sydney Stadium on Saturday night, is one
of the cleverest boxers that the L’.S. has
contributed to these shores for a long time.
He is so capable at his trade that if he was always
a trier he would rarely be beaten in his class, and
if beaten the margin would be a narrow one. He
opened a hot favorite against Blackburn, who was
believed to be incapable of coming back against such
a vigorous and artistic opponent; but the first few
rounds demonstrated to the discerning that some-
thing was gravely wrong somewhere. At one stage
it looked as if Mcßride wanted to end the un-
convincing struggle on a foul. However, though
he executed practically his entire repertory of illegi-
timate shots on tiie person of the protesting Aus-
tralian pug, Joe Wallis made no move, and the
fight finished as Mcßride had apparently intended
it should. He took a sound hiding with cheery forti-
tude, and Blackburn administered if like an artist.
Hughie Dwyer (9st. 1011 b.) and Harry
Holmes (9st. 11 lb.) supplied the race-night scrap
at Brisbane Stadium, and a sparkling scrap it was.
There wasn’t much fight in it- —neither lad is a
fighter, as the term used to be understood —but there
was any amount of skill and speed. Dwyer was the
cleverer of the pair, and justly got the decision.
The one thing he lacks at present is a knock-out
punch. If he adds one to his repertoire, by boat-
pulling or some other device, he will whip any man
in Australia at the weight.

According to the cable, Patterson, Ander-
son and O’Hara Wood have decided not to appear
in English tournaments. They want to concentrate
on practising for the Davis Cup. It shows the deter-
mination of the Australians when they are willing
to sacrifice their chances of personal success at the
big Wimbledon meeting; but thousands will be dis-
appointed by their withdrawal 1 , especially as the
Americans, Tilden and Johnston, will also be absent.
On paper the world’s singles looked a good thing
for either Patterson or Anderson, and Patterson and
Wood, or Anderson and Lycett, would have been
favorites for the doubles. Then there was the possi-
bility of Patterson further helping the gate by
entering the mixed doubles with Mile. Lenglen.
However, the Australians have done the right thing.
They have, to meet Belgium _at Scarborough on June
22, and they need all their time to get into form.
* # * *
Britain’s lack of youthful tenuis talent is
shown by the selection of three veterans —liingseote,
Lowe and Riseley—to ,js up port. Lycett in the struggle
for the Davis Opp.' Riseley, whtKgave up first-class
tennis in 19p6', is almost as antique as Roper-
Barrett. thep acknowledged Methuselah-- of the game
in England. Lowe, who came with Kingseote and
Beamish /to tackle Australia for the Cup in 1919,
has made several appearances for the Cold Country
in the .international tournament, and if dogged base-
line driving could win matches he would have to
hire a town hall to house his trophies. Britain
will probably have to depend most on Kingseote and
Lycett. Kingseote, who must be 50 or near it, is a
great stroke-artist, and the form of Lycett is so
good, both in singles and doubles, that he might
well manage to win a tie off his own racquet.
Yet he is close on 40, and his collapse agaifist
Shimidzu, at Wimbledon last year, sugsests that
he hasn’t the stamina to last out a gruelling game
with either Patterson or Anderson.

Two or three splashes of dressiness were
perceptible among the crowd at Her Majesty’s
on Saturday night, but the most expensive
people had been to the races and were tak-
ing no risk of catching a chill. Some of
them, in fact, had safeguarded themselves
against the weather by dining not too wisely
but jolly well. Boxes on the managerial
side of the circle held the Frank Taits in
one case, and in the other, facing the house,
sat Miss Tallis, looking very conscious of her
sire’s brand-new Birthday honor. Opposite
was a bunch of sophisticated flappers,
friends of Claude Flemming; and in the next
box sat Mrs. Gordon Chirnside, her mother,
and two other women. There was no mas-
culine show in the boxes. Men had enjoyed
a bad day at Flemington, it was understood,
and as regards gladness and applause this
was not one of their nights out. Besides,
Rene Maxwell, George Gee and Hugh Steyne
are not prime favorites with the knowing
sort of men who follow the gees, and the
latter wouldn't be greatly interested in
Rene’s royal robes and wedding outfit, any-
how. “A Little Dutch Gill” is rich neither
in chiffons nor in thrills. Remarks on the
“novelty” of Maie Baird’s statue dance were
heard, but there’s nothing new in the idea of
an animated statue, nor any poetry in the
notion of the stereotyped burglar coming
to dally roughly with a cold stone lady
whom he has pinched from her pedestal. A
most unikely proceeding on the burglar’s
part.
Percy Crawford, of the Melb. Tivoli man-
agement, is trying not to look too uppish
over his promotion to parental rank. The
little person that gave him his lift is a girl,
and she’ll be a proud lass if she grows up
as handsome as her mother.
The Best dame’s eldest chick, Margot, has
tucked up her plait and will shortly don
the white trappings of a deb. In the mean-
time Margot, a plump, good-looking flapper,
is doing a few exercise gallops, in the form
of tea-parties, under the maternal wing;
calculated to get her into form for the bigger
social work ahead.
The cream of musical East-Suburbia has
been having the time of its life in a series
of choir orgies. Melbourne Town Hall was
well filled for the first affair, with admiring
friends and sisters from East Camberwell
and other respectable outer-circles. It’s a
proud business, standing in rows of gleam-
ing white evening dress, backed by the
black-and-whiteness of the bassos and tenors,
with choir-master Mewton waving slender
hands to charm the best out of that respect-
able mass of Voice. Pianiste Nellie Billings
and baritone Bartleman did something to
reinforce the programme, and some queer
people, evidently not sisters or mothers or
uncles of the Choir, insisted upon recalling
them. Altogether, it was a wonderful
uight, and Sweet Nell at the piano played
with more delicacy and feeling than usual,
maybe because she had a new frock of prim-
rose satin and gold lace, which suited her
beautifully.
Pat Mullins, best known of Tallangatta
Valley pastoralists, went out last week, after
a very long innings. He was a man of 45
when he went to the Valley half a century
back, and up till a year ago was able to
lead a fairly active life. Some of his sons
engaged in grazing and are mighty prosper-
ous. One (F.W.) was parish priest of
Tamworth (N.S.W.) and his death was a
heavy blow to the old man.
When a passenger train, with Premier
I .awson on board, ran into a goods at
Macedon the other night nobody was hurt,
but the little incident is to be relentlessly
probed. If the head of a Government who
has slipped home quietly for a day can’t
come down to town to attend a levee and d
Governor’s dinner without risking his life
it is time somebody was shaken up. No
wonder Clapp was a trifle sick qext day.
The large audience at Annie Besant’s one
and only lecture in the Town Hall was inter-
esting as a| study in human weirdness.
Scores of old theosophists had emerged from
their calm retreats to do honor to the occa-
sion, and seemingly a large body of junior
members of i the cult had been laid on for
ushering purposes. Annie, introduced by
the local president of the Mahatma crowd,
arrived punctually at 8 upon the platform
and waited for silence ere she started a some-
what inaudible address. Even Solomon of
old was not arrayed more theatrically than
the aged agitatress. She was ail in white
and gold. The material of her robes looked
rich, and the gold threads and appendages
gleamed with mysticism. The white hair,
viewed from a side seat, seemed to be perched
on her head like a dear old lady’s cap. It
looked more coquettish than theosophical,
and, whether real or otherwise, it accentu-
ated the difference between Mrs. Besant and
those grim early mothers of political reform
of whom we read. Nobody could mistake
her for a strong-minded matron escaped from
Dickensian fiction. She was got up to kill
unbelief. Her lecture turned out to be a
not very far-reaching utterance. It sounded
like a plea for Bolshevism camouflaged as a
profession or loyalty to the British Empire. A
few thin-blooded cheers broke out on two or
three occasions during the lecture, and then
a number of non-theosophists waited to see
Annie motor home, and a handful of the
devout gave her a mild, bashful three cheers
as she tooted away.
Smoke-night tickets issued by the mere
man management of the Vic. Artists’ Society
should make many a deceased suffragette
turn in her little grave. A footnote states
that “Lady members are asked to pass their
tickets on to gentlemen friends.” Evidently
the idea is still extant that smoking was
meant for man alone. The footnote is really
a most indelicate hint to women patrons of
the gold-tipped “fag.” They are desired to
stay away lest their presence should be a
check on the feast of improprieties and the
flow of language. Their “broad-minded”
brother-members would be embarrassed and
would rather do without them. They could
help the entertainment, but their efforts
would lack the masculine touch of smoke-
room art, no doubt. Heigho! The brutes
have all the best of it. V.A.S. sistren will
hardly pare to retaliate by giving an after-
noon-tea where the companionship of the
coarser sex is politely prohibited.
Anthony Lucas, the fatted Greek who
runs the Cocktailia, Melbourne’s most highly-
gilded cafO, is “swellin’ wisibly,” both physi-
cally and financially. Originally Anthony
was in a very small friedfishnoyster way.
Now he is on the way to become a movie-
magnate, merely as a means of putting his
spare cash to work. He has the chief
interest in the immense Swanston-street
picture-palace which is now building, and
should make handsome interest on his invest-
ment in view of the fact that the site is
right opposite the Town Hall. Lucas
nowadays lives at Wliernside, Toorak,
formerly the Albert Miller dwelling, runs a
fleet of motor-cars, and takes trips to Europe.
And yet, somehow, he doesn’t look happy.
If you come to think of it few Greek rest-
aurateurs ever do look happy.
This is Nancy Weigall, who starred so
brightly in the last Mermaid Repertory play,
“St. George ana the
Dragon” (she was
the Earl’s daughter
who complained that
a free choice of
parents is denied
us). Miss Nancy,
who is the middle
one of the Wei-
gall Iv.C.’s trio of
brainy daughters, has
inherited the pianis-
t.ie genius of her
mothgr. Mrs. Wei-
gall would undoubt-
edly have won pro-
fessional laurels had
she been born in a
less exalted atmo-
sphere She was the
daughter of a late
Apple Island Governor, Sir Robert Hamil-
ton. _ The elder Weigall sister (now
tripping overseas) is a ’Varsity intellectual
and the younger, artist Joan, is Mrs. Daryl
Lindsay. Their only brother, named Tlieyre,
like his dad, side-tracked a ’Varsity career
to tread the Inky Way as a member of the
Herald’s penny-halfpenny staff.
The sentimental young man and his girl
find “The Bat’’ truly a wonderful play. They
cling to each other, unseen, and hence un-
derided, right through the numerous scenes
in which the lights are black-out. The con-
sensus of opinion in Melbourne love-making
circles is that the mystery play offers more
Opportunities for hand-holding, stolen em-
braces and the like than any picture-palace.
In the case of others regret is expressed that
the frequent spells of gloom hide the gracious
spectacle of the little Parkes girl. She has
evolved a new frock—a duck of a thing in
pale chiffon and satin, very short in the skirt
and very high in the pink-sashed waist. .
Paul Bibron’s Casino de Paris showed, at
its second seance at Anzac House, that it
is getting a hold for the winter. Leslie
Madden-Nelken went along in a Frenchy
black frock, with some sapphire leaves in her
hair and her new husband in devoted attend-
ance. Coleman, of J.C.W. scenic fame, got
an evening off from the theatre—the first in
months—and jazzed busily; and Bernadon,
one of Bib.’s first crack pupils, also went
casinoing. The A, E. Y. Richardsons had a
big supper-party and Lieut.-Col. Watson
danced the programme out. A lot of Diggers
made a frieze of intent faces above the gal-
lery parapet as they viewed the whirl from
above.
The Girl Guide movement, of which Prin-
cess Mary Lascelles is the boss, is getting a
special boost in Australia. The Stradbroke
Countess, who did work of the kind in Eng-
land, is now' the head Girl Guide in Victoria,
and is busy forming an executive committee
which will include women of the calibre of
Mrs. Alfred Deakin as helpers. There is
already a growing batch of vice-presidents—
all matrons of social imnortance —who will
watch the interests of the movement. The
Girl Guide scheme is no tomboy affair.
Though it works along the lines of the Boy
Scouts, it is essentially feminine. The girl is
taught law-an’-order in her household w T ork
and personal life, loyalty to a Chief, and
general method. Miss R. Hamilton, princi-
pal of the Toorak College, who is secretary
of the organisation, has had the first Guide
company in Victoria as a going concern for
18 months, so she has the details at her
finger ends.
The Apple Island, too, has been taking its
Girl Guides seriously for some time, and
Lady Barron was wrapped up heart and soul
in the movement in \Vestralia when she was
Governoress. One of her aides, Miss Grade
Holder, is just now doing temperance work
round the various States.
The Clive Leonard pair are in raptures
over the arrival of a baby girl. But still
prouder are the paternal grand-parents of
the infant, who find a girl an exciting epi-
sode after three sons and a brace of grand-

When the Libia sailed north her boss,
Burzagli, frequently ducked inland to the
Backblocks. He was running a regular
Bac-k-to-Italy revival the other way round.
The Consul-General joined him in'some of
the journeys. Italy is very much alive to
the advisability of letting its youth see the
far parts of the earth and also of keeping
a touch of home in the hearts of its exiles
and their Australian-born children, and
Burzagli, a patrician of strong personality,
was able to work wonders in that line. In-
cidentally, he used to be on the staff of
the Due d’Abruzzi, the admiral-explorer
who visited Australia in 'O6, and one of his
treasures on the Libia is a huge silver cup
presented by his old chief. Burzagli is
well chosen as a wanderer. He is a bache-
lor, and all his people are dead with the
exception of one naval brother. His only
home is in Florence, where he has a villa
wth a wonderfully-terraced garden and a
library which is the delight of his life. Here
after each voyage he tucks himself away,
and gives himself up to his books and his
writings.
There will be four women candidates at
the Speck’s elections in June —Mrs. Lyons
and Mrs. Youl for Wilmot, and Mrs. Water-
worth and Mrs. O’Shea-Petersen for Deni-
son. Mrs. Lyons is the wife of the leader
of the Laborites; Mrs. Youl is the widow
of a one-time M.L.C.; and Mrs. Waterworth
i$ the wife of Newham Waterworth, a
Hobart optician, who tried hard to get into
the House himself, but at last gave it up as
a bad job. Mgs. O’Shea-Petersen has tried
before. She has buried two husbands and
wears the name of both —O’Shea being that
of the first.
“Never saw so many red-raggers in my life
at a Governor’s show,” said one State Minis-
ter after the Stradbroke lev€e. Asked what
Bolshies he had spotted, the Cabineteer
explained that he didn’t mean that sort —he
alluded to Judges, bishops, ’Varsity grandees
and so on, who arrayed themselves in what
they called scarlet, crimson or something,
but which made the ordinary man “see red.”
All the beating up by the dailies, the sending-
out of private entree cards galore, and the
“come-in-your-sac-suits” bait resulted in an
attendance of only 450. Naval, military and
official people made up the bulk of the
crowd. And yet his Ex. is as popular as
anv cocked hat we have had since Hopetoun.
By the way, Lawson, who is credited with
inducing Stradbroke to sanction sac suits at
the hand-shaking, went in a top hat and t!ie
garb inseparable from that style of head-
gear.
The Madden lady is packing up her travel-
ling gear for a flit to England in a month or
two. Her daughter, Mrs. Pat Osborne, ran
over to see her recently and give Melbourne
a peek at. some of her smart tailor-mades.
Ruby of the Dimples has never dropped her
reputation as a smart and individual frocker.
Now that Thomas Lyle has been knighted
George Swinburne is the only commoner on
the Vic. Electricity Commission. John
Monash (whose decorations fairly dazzled
the guests at the Governor’s dinner on Fri-
day) and Robert Gibson are already mem-
bers of our somewhat comic, little peerage.
Chris Lorimer, .artist, does not restrict
her energies to oil-and-canvas, though she
has made a definite place for herself among
the V.A.S. people.
She is an ardent
worker in move-
ments that help
women, and js pos-
sessed of a fine
power of organisa-
tion. For 11 years
she was a member
of the Arts and
Crafts Council, and
organised several
exhibitions. In her
native city, Bal-
-lar a t, she seere-
taried the Art Asso-
ciation for years,
and now she is put-
ting her organising
ability into the
training school for
physical-culture teachers. Miss Lorimer is
battling hard for special registration of such
teachers, as she holds that one who has had
only a limited training can do untold harm
with growing girls. The ’Varsity and many
medical men, as well as most of the medical
women in Melbourne, are interested in the
physical-training school for Australian
women instituted by Ethel Webb and organ-
ised by Miss Lorimer. In England similar
work is being done publicly, but it began
many years ago with the private efforts of
Mrs. Ostcrberg, who spent her life perfect-
ing her school and system, and at her death
bequeathed the result of her work to the
nation. The picture of the energetic Chris
Lorimer herewith was made by Lafayette.
Some ambitious State officers have been
given time off to attend ’Varsity lectures to
fit themselves f df degrees and diplomas, but
on the understanding that they should show
their gratitude by staying three years in the
service after finishing their courses. Evi-
dently the pact has not been observed, and
now a £lOO leg-rope is being attached to all
such officers in the way of a bond guarantee.
Still, it would be worth paying a hundred
if the other fellow offered a big increase of
screw. A sort of premium for a good billet.
Gerald Grove has relinquished the job of
private sec. to the Earl, and Major Wilkin-
son, who has had some experience of Govern-
ment Housing in W.A., is to be given a trial
gallop or two. He will be No. 4—and his
Ex. has been here just on 16 months.
Ella Shields swept breezily through Mel-
bourne on her way to England. She was a
sporting figure in Collins-street with her
tawny tailor-made and glossy black stick.
On Thursday night she visited the Tivoli as
an onlooker, and held quite a reception in
her box. The following evening she shud-
dered through “The Bat.” and she indulged
in manv farewell parties during the day or
two her boat was in port. Ella intends to
return to Australia about a year hence, and
is said to have an eye on some property in
a Melbourne subbub which she will turn into
a home.
A line or two from Adelaide: —
The estate of Mrs. G. S. Fowler, sworn at
£17,600, goes to her family.
Archibald Strong is getting his share of work as
a speaker at public meetings, and was jointly billed
with W. J. Sowden to talk on Naval defence at the
Navy League’s annual muster. Since November, ’lB,
there has been a marked slump in the vogue for
patriotic meetings, but this League whipped up a
fine attendance and gave an equally good account of
its year’s work. The membership is well over 1000.
Ex-Mayor Glover goes back as president, with half-a-
dozen V.-P.’s to give him a helping hand.
Tile Y.W.C.A. is in search of funds (who isn't?),
and has organised a two days’ ffite as a possible
means to the desired end. The show is staged in
the Town Hall, and the Kidman dame, Mrs. McCoy,
Mrs. Henshaw Jackson and Mrs. J. L, Lewis arc
among the stall-holders.
Corporal Jensen, V.C., the Dane who was natural-
ised in September, ’l4, and enlisted a year later,
died at the Adelaide Hospital the other day after
a brief illness. He was a sailor on a Murray steam-
boat before he got into khaki.
This State’s Division of the Red Cross Society
has decided to fall into line with the rest of Aus-
tralia and add vice-presidents to its list of officers.
Till now there has been no step between the
Governor’s wife as president and the executive com-
mittee, and a meeting in mid-June is to make the
fateful change.
The Conservatorium the other night reached No. 6
on the list of its students’ concerts for the 1922
session. The evening’s laurels went to Mignon
Weston for a wood-wind solo, Schumann’s “Romances
for the Oboe, 1 and 3.” She is a daughter of the
versatile little lady who launched community singing
in this village.
Pressure of W'ork has forced Judge Murray to
throw up the chairmanship of the St. Peter’s Old
Collegians’ Association —a job he has held for seven
years. Walter Duncan, M.L.C., goes into the
vacated chair, and G. C. Campbell fills the gap on
the committee. Incidentally, the Association mourns
with the school the serious illness of T. A. Caterer,
one of the oldest-established masters, and the death
of T. J. S. O’Halloran, a keen supporter of the
Association.

The warm sunshine of a still winter day
breathed benediction on beauty and bookie
alike last Saturday at Randwick when the
Winter meeting was opened in stirring style
by Spear Song, who flashed like an assegai
over the last hurdle and shot home ahead of
its prettily-named rival Gold Snow. After
that excitement the clouds of birds settled
down once more on the trees, and the fur-
wearers loosened their peltrv and stretched
themselves in the sun at the back of the
official stand. Whatever the difference of
opinion as to the higher merit of bead or
fringe embroideries, tailor-made or clinging
fabric, there was but one voice with regard
to the absolute necessity for furs. Skin
coats were in the minority,.. but luscious
capes and stoles everywhere bespoke high
ffnance or enviable credit. And the Indian
summer afternoon smiled humorously down
on flocks of women who wore their beasties
front-to-back, so that painted or terraced chins
were snugly befringed by high fur borders.
The ugliness .of a black-stockinged leg end-
ing in a white-and-black shoe was clearly
demonstrated on every side; but most of the
knee-to-toe covering was in tones of grey
and brown, and as most of the Sydney lasses
refused to cramp their style by the longer
skirts decreed by Paris the effect was
exhilaratingly Hellenic.
Dame Margaret, who had gathered quite a
large party around her, wore a befeathered
black hat, and mole cuffs and collar cheered
up her navy one-piece. Owen Cox and his
niece, Miss 80.11 so r, in stone-grey tailorings,
hobnobbed with vice-royalty, as did the
Attorney-General Bavin couple. The Judge
liolin pair helped each other to pick win-
ners, she outstanding as ever, in a frock of
»l ,e .,. s^a^e a poilu’s uniform. Dame
INellie Melba, under vice-regal patronage,
surveyed the universe over the high fur
fence that finished off her blue satin cloak.
.Mrs. I itt Rivers had picked a millinery
winner, and looked conscious of it. Mrs.
A. R. Hughes wore a knee-length fur cape
that must have represented a Canadian
trapper s season. The skins were a deep
brown in the shade and flashed into smoulder-
ing fireglow in the sunlight. It had the
effect of making all the furs in the vicinity
look like poor relations. Premier George
hollers daughter, Gwen, had twisted a bit
of the afternoon sky around a grey satin hat,
and after that had descended to the earthi-
ness of a dove-grey suit. With her was a
tall girl in a dashing cavalier cape-frock of
the tone of mustard pickles. One of the
most graceful “all grey” exponents was tall
Chance ; and furs in cxcelsis enwrapped
Mrs. Tony Hordern; while Ina Clift added
deep fur bands to her usual grey tailorings,
btella George, of Neutral Bay, carried her
famous Burmese silk umbrella ; and blonde
Mrs. Belisario crushed a henna hat on her
pretty hair, and was otherwise swagger in
grey.
Judge Gordon had a birthday last week,
and made it an excuse for going to see
Charlie Chaplin in “The Kid.” He cun-
ningly concealed his own desire by giving
a birthday-party to about 20 youngsters of
his acquaintance, including his own pair
lhey were mostly the pupils of the French
class that studies at the Elizabeth Bay
Gordon home, and of course Daphne and
Diana Davidson were in the throng. Inci-
dentally, there was a cake-eating at
I armer s, but this was so hurried over owing
to. the nearness of closing-time that for 20
minutes S’Onor stood on Farmer’s corner
surrounded by his flock and looking like a
High Chancellor shepherding wards
in Chancery.
Polo,, which is almost the last of thi
sports in which the moneyed man can re-
gard himself as safe from the humiliating
intrusion of the skilled “menial” (to borrow
the Leander Rowing Club’s peerless phrase)
has definitely started again in Sydney. Cord
Digby, Captain Traill and Captain Pitt
Rivers are among the Government House
representatives who are practising fairly re-
gularly ; and Ken Austin, his brother-in-law.
Dennis Allen (who is waiting to become a
solicitor before he marries) and Ken Rich-
ards turn up at the much-improved ground
pretty regularly. Colin Stephen, a bright
light of other days, is too busy to represent
Sydney these days, and another stalwart
Jack Garvan, is off’ with two of. his unmar-
ried sisters on the Niagara.
Mona Greene has become engaged to a
Doctor Denne; she met him during her
recent visit to Colombo.
One of the most popular pastimes of Aus-
tralian women in England consists in flying
from London to Paris. Among the latest to
accomplish the feat were Mrs. Wilshire l •
sister of Mrs. Fred Payne, of Melbourne)
and Mrs. Dick Horsfall, who was Ada Fos-
bery before she married old Itupert Carring-
ton’s brother-in-law. The latter was so
air-sick that the beauties of the Channel-
crossing, such as they are, escaped Tier.
Captain and Mrs. Burroughs are the next
well-known R.N. pair to depart: they leave
for England on the Ascanius.
The chief parties of the race festivities
were the McCormicks’ hop at their Point
Piper home, the Bruntons’ dance at
Gladsv'ood, and the Pat Osbornes’ effort
at the Tony Horderns’ huge place—
Mrs. Hordern is Mrs. Pai’s cousin.
The first skimmed all the Sassiety cream
from the Admiralty House set down; the
second was just as swagger, though there
was no vice-regal halo over it: and every-
one but the socially lost turned up at the
third. Pat Osborne is the best-known and
most successful member of his family (he
has succeeded at everything—even racing),
and his wife is as popular as he is.
Serious-eyed little Bertha, one of the bril-
liant Ryan sisters of Lucknow Downs.
Queensland, made an unobtrusive transfer
of herself to the ownership of Captain Ernest
Nelson-Turner, of Bristol. England. Padre
Lane blessed the knot-tying at Dara, and
the breakfast fizzed in the jazz-room of the
Bellevue Hotel. The honeymoon is being
spent in Tasmania, M.L. and Honolulu.
Mark Sheldon will remove his knighthood
to England shortly and bring his wife and
tte girls back with the thing to Sydney. The
new knightess is the adored sister of Tom
Dalton.
Henry Penn was responsible for a concert
of all-British music at the Conservatorium
last week, and, with the assistance of vio-
linist Hoogstoel, and ’cellist Messeas, carried
most of the programme. Roy Agnew’s
Sonata was the new composition of the even-
ing. and the enthusiasm of the pianist sud-
denly metamorphosed the audience from a
cold-storage condition to one of fervid
applause. The Concerto is modern to the
last degree, and hasn’t two bars of melody
that a milk boy with a ready ear could sneak
off the premises with. But modern music
has no melody in the pre-war sense, and Roy
is essentially of his times, and one of the
most originally creative composers in Aus-
tralia.
A bride of all-Australian interest this
week was pretty I’attie McCausland, only
grand-daughter of the late S’William Lyne.
Relations from all points have been camp-
ing at the Australia and Carlton, among
them the Featberstonehaughs, whom Banjo
Paterson immortalised i.n outback verse.
Miss Roseby. of Kambala, is off to Eng-
land by way of America this week. Her
older sister, who returned a few months ago
from a wild jag at Educational Conferences,
and is now positively heady with all the
latest ideas, will carry on the swagger Rose
Bay school.
Here is Sister F. Lowe, assistant-matron
of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, wear-
in g uniform and
her marching-to-the-
war expression. She
had quite a different
sort of look for the
thousands of
wounded who were
nursed under her
wing at Abassia,
France and Eng-
land. She was twice
mentioned in
despatches for brav-
ery, by the way.
Sister Lowe trained
at the big Camper-
do w n institution,
and with the excep-
tion of her years at
the war has spent
all her grown-up life
within its walls. Her pet job just now is
keeping a mothering eye on the Digger wards
at the R.P.A.
The Rawson Institute .netted a big fish for
its annual meeting last Friday, and the
Davidson lady presided. Secretary Miss
Austin read a report that was as full of
hope as a gold-mining prospectus, and Thea
Milner Stephen grew quite daring in her
advocacy of Clever Marying the spots off
the morals of the big city. Newly-returned
Admiral Rolleston was one of the most
interested of the afternoon’s visitors; and
Melba dropped in late, clutching a cheque
for £25. Mrs. Arthur Scrivener, helped by
her attractive band of St. Andrew’s Guild
girls, was the hostess of the afternoon; and
gentle Chaplain Tomlinson looked more than
ever like an ascetic stepped down from the
centre piece of a stained-glass window.
So many beauties floated, billowed or
swashbiickied at tfie Cretonne dinner-dance
at the Wentworth in aid of St. Margaret's
Hospital the other night that a really plain
girl of the pre-war period would have been
positively eye-soothing. All the prize-winners
had been entrees for the recent Evening
News’s Good Cooks Stakes. Mrs. Eerdi-
nand Glynns Lady Teazle was an easy
winner in the costume department, though
sweet Sylvia Gardiner, as deep-eyed and
straight-backed as a young Maori girl, was
a close-runner-up. A seductive-looking lamp-
shade won another prize, and Nada Conrade,
a Tivoli charmeuse, showed a total disregard
for the scientific statement that the earth
is growing colder every year, and as “a.d.
1940” wore an arrangement in black and
white that looked like an advanced fashion-
note of the Ostend bathing season. It w T as
an affair of long black stockings, knee
breeches, some top-hamper that ended about
the armpits, a short bat-shaped cape from
shoulder-blade to shoulder-blade, and a hat
that looked like a newly-hatched aeroplane.
The Originality prize was hers from the
moment the judges had finished rubbing
their eyes. A Dolly Varden bonnet enfolded
Edna Keeley’s curls. Sister Iverven, of the
hospital, wore the bunched skirts of the late
Georgian days, and another hospital sister
went as a money-box or something of the
kind and labelled herself £ s. d. The insti-
tution’s finance secretary. May Sheehan, as
“Minuet,” suggested Chopin and Versailles.
There were others, nearlv 800 of them, and
it was all very resplendent as far as the
funds were concerned; but the poor over-
flow in the palm-court had only arrived at
the fish at 9.30. They have probably reached
the ices by now.
Herewith Basil Mackey, one of Sydney’s
clever young pianists. He was on the down-
stairs staff of Paling’s when somebody heard
him play and sug-
gested that he should
ask the then-famous
Signor de RCaupuis
to listen to the noises
he made. He did,
and as the rever-
berating echoes died
wistfully away the
great man said:
“Come to me for a
month, and at the
end of it I will
tell you whether the
keyboard or the
counter shall be
your book of life.”
Or words to that
effect. At the end
of the month De
Beaupuis told the
youngster to concentrate on piano-punching.
After his old teacher’s death Mackey studied
first with Pintel, and then with Georgio.
London and Paris claim him after his con-
cert at the Town Hall on June 15.
After careful study of the pipe band as it
skirled defiance to the world in “Macdonald
Going to the War” a few evenings ■ ago at
the new Cafe Ecossais (which isn’t French
for oatmeal and haggis), it suddenly became
clear why the Scotch are the best golfers in
the world. The man who plays the big drum
swings back his sticks in the most approved
manner of driving, regarding the universe
meanwhile with a gloomy and fixed concen-
tration—-the real golfer’s expression. The
pew cafe, housed in the building which used
to shelter a German Club before the High-
land Society took it over, was opened the
other night with a French dinner and jazz
in the interests of the Prince of Wales’s
Nurses’ Home. The guests were mostly con-
sular and Scotch. Picture-star Louise
Lovely’s mother is the smiling hostess of the
latest eatery.
Jolly Marcelle Kellerman (Annette’s sister)
is engaged to one of her beloved Diggers.
She worked in Paris for the Aussies till the
end of the war, and it was there she met
the lucky man.'He is a Bananalander named
Fred Wooster. Marcelle, who designs all
her sister’s clothes, is also a clever illustra-
tor.
Nerve-specialist Chisholm Ross, of Mac-
quane-street. has had to say “Bless you, no
children, to. his son Chishoim and Gwynneth
Mori ice Williams, of Toorak, Melbourne,
who are entering into housekeeping partner-
ship during the year. The young man fol-
lows medicine, like his father.
St. James’s staged the wedding of hist
week, when tall, black-haired Linda Mc-
Master, only daughter of the James Mc-
Masters, of Wonorai, Mudgee, married
Vivian Giddins. of Crow Wood Park. Wilt-
shire. The bride, who affects a Madonna
hairdressing, wore pearly-toned satin that
seemed modelled on a Burne Jones illustra-
tion She moored her veil with a wide silver
band, into which she had slipped an ear-
knot of orange blossom. Georgette in apri-
cot and gold tones clothed bridesmaids Alix
Mackay and Marjorie Alison, who also had
the moral support of brown-and-gold tulle
hats and bouquets of wallflowers. Lieut,
rnei, It.N., was best man, and Commander
Nelson Clover groomsman. After a honey-
moon at Jenolan and Melbourne, they leave
(on the 22nd) for the U.S. and England.
Queenie Goninan, an old Abbotsleigh
(Wahroonga) giri, whose people are New-
castle steel magnates and who has been
studying art in the Quartier Mont Parnasse,
Paris, is one of the few Australians who has
had a picture accepted for the Salon. And
she is absolutely the only one, so far as is
known, to marry a Servian. The venture
has resulted in her becoming Mrs. Marco-
vitch, and she has just gone back to Bel-
grade and the national sport—bloodshed.
She met him when be was a law student
in Paris.
“Babby” Munroe is leaving Sydney to star
with Melba at Ooombe Cottage. She is the
tall, dark and good-looking daughter of the
Ross. Munroes, of Queensland. Her brother.
Roy Munroe, married Connie Johnson, whose
people used to have a station near Yass, but
who now inhabit Summerlees, Moss Vale.
The Johnsons are relations of the Arm-
strongs, and Melba often stays with them
U.S. Consul Norton and his wife are
going home for five months. Her health has
been poor and the holiday is mainly designed
to improve it. They leave by the Ventura
on June 14. Both are Spanish scholars and
ardent collectors, and the lady owns what is
probably the finest private collection of old
embroideries Australia has ever harbored.
Artistic leanings seem the prerogative of
Consuls, by the way. Lindquist, of Sweden,
has a big establishment on the North Shore
line packed with art treasures. His sense
of coloring is so intense that one day in late
autumn, when Sydney Ure Smith and John
Longstaff visited him, they found a pumpkin,
very squat and very red, as the central
decoration of an old table that had been
so polished as to take on the hues of tortoise-
shell.
J. J. Smith’s widow and her two step-
daughter chums left last week for another
tour of the East. The announcement of
their intending departure acted as a clarion-
call among the Foy clan; and farewell fo.-d
has been flung at them from all angles in the
last few weeks. Chester Foy polished off the
festivities with an ultra-smartly dressed
dance in their honor.
The Victoria League is submerged to the
eyebrows in the work of its second inter-
state conference, which was opened during
the week at the Women’s Club by Lady
Forster. Immigration, education-and book
distribution in the Backblocks are the pro-
blems it means to tackle, and the Cullens’
garden-party will represent its relaxation.
The net result of the Bush Book Club's
production of “Quinney’s” (£348 Is. 4d.)
goes to refurnish the shelves of the cockies’
and bowndarywiders’ circulating library.
God knows how drearily life in some of the
little wayback homes would drag if it weren’t
for the parcels of books that bring a glimpse
of the worlds beyond the horizon. “More
members, more subscripting,” was the cry at
the club’s annual meeting the other day,
when vice-royalty presided, and founder of
the club, Mrs. Aubrey Withers, and such good
workers as Beulah Bolton, Bea McDonald
and fragile and befurred Dorothea Mackellar
were on the platform.
Alfred O’Shea, the young tenor who left
Australia five years ago to study with Signor
Loria in London, and later with Fabbri in
Milan, has come under the management of
Nevin Tait in England. He is fair and of
slim build, and when he sang a love aria
at the Queen’s Hall, London, the other week,
the British matrons in the front seats de-
cided that he was as dangerous as a nightin-
gale in June, and kept a stern eye on then-
daughters for the rest of the evening. O’Shea
is a Sydneyite, and paid for his tuition out
of a Bulletin pay envelope previous to
adventuring to London'.
Dion Titheradge has been repairing a
throat that had struck in London’s fog with
doses of Sicilian sunshine. A mountain
perbh in Taorinna was his address, and here
he wrote a three-act play with which he
hopes to conquer London. Partner in
“Billy the Boy” Ken Duffield is returning
to West Australia with his English wife.
The lucky young man has just inherited
some new flocks and herds, and lias dropped
revue-making to inspect his heritage.
The Australian Painter-Etchers’ Society is
holding its second annual exhibition in the
Education Department Gallery. “Ah,” said
one girl at the opening on Saturday, as she
stood before a panel of Norman Lindsay’s,
“Easv seen his models are Australian.”
“Why?” asked her friend. “Because none of
them has that rationed look!”
One of Sydney’s best-known charity
workers is noted for the extreme modesty of
her decolletage, and for her almost unvary-
ing mode of softening the black of her day-
light frocks with sheer white fronts. The
other afternoon she was trying to withdraw
early from a popular niece’s crowded draw-
ing-room on the plea that she had to dress
for a dinner-party. “Dress?” exclaimed the
niece, “Oh, Auntie, you don't dress—you
only take off your dickey!”

And promised even Heaven itself to the brave.

On your altar, fiery spruiker, while you, coo) parson,

The first issue of the Forum, a Sydney
fortnightly, appeared last month. In its
general make-up it suggests a London weekly
of the Spectator or Nation type, with a
little verse, a leader page, letters from
prominent citizens on subjects of national
importance and so forth. The articles bear
such well-known names as H. S. Nicholas
(who writes brilliantly on the Genoa Con-
ference), A. W. Jose, T. W. Heney and D.
I). Braham, the editor. It will be interesting
to watch the public reaction to so much
signed journalism. The one-man signed
article has always been popular in France,
and (very occasionally) it has been a suc-
cess in England. But usually if a paper
carries a “Max” or a “G. 8.5.,” in addition
to some revealed heavyweight, the limit
seems to have been reached. The political
attitude of the new paper is disappointing.
There is ample room tor a journal which will
express what cultivated Australians of all
classes feel about the activities of the illiter-
ates and agents provocateurs who dominate
Ministries such as the nresent N. S. Wales
oue. The Forum is as uon-committal, here,
as one of those dailies which depend for their
circulation on those who persistently elect
our shabby political adventurers to Parlia-
ment. The paper contains a number of
admirable book reviews, and some authori-
tative notes on finance, and it is in these
directions, probably, that it will develop
most definitely as it becomes established.

“I want to add my testimony to the many which you have regarding
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery, for I have tried this remarkable remedy,
and I can honestly say that 1 have ne\er come across anything to equal
it. It is simply amazing how quickly it eases my throat and cures my
cold. There is nothing in the world puts me out more than a cold, and
1 was feeling quite distressed when 1 started to use Dr. Sheldon’s New
Discovery on the advice of a friend, and I had not taken two doses before
1 began to feel better, and one small bottle put me quite right again. It
is a true remedy, and I heartily recommend it.”

Motherless.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BABY hands so white and sweet,
Little dimpled baby feet,
Eyes of pure pellucid blue
(God His mercy siumng througn!)
YVnen you grow a little older.
Colder, bolder.
Will you hate the shame, poor kid,
When you know w T hat Mother did?
Mother simply -went off with another sort of
man.
Mother talked of love a lot (word she
didn’t know r
Ev’n the first true meaning of). Mother had
a plan,
Teased her body, fouled her body. Mother
had to go.
Mother thought your dad too old. Didn’t
care a cent.
Killed her soul and killed my life, but she
up and w T ent.
Baby dear, the world is wide
(Love dishonored, wounded pride),
Some say; but for you and me
It’s as narrow as can be.
When the lights of life shine dimmer
For you, grimmer,
Will you hate yourself, girl kid,
As you learn what Mother did?
Mother went to pieces. Went off with a
man.
Found your doting Dad too old. Itched
for younger stuff.
Mother shamed us both to death, hide it as
we can.
Went to Hell, as wantons will, cheerfully
enough.
Mother had no soul to save—-didn’t know'
what it meant.
Lurching prowler came along. Beckoned
her. She w r ent.
Now where Mother lives and lusts.
Howsoever Fortune’s thrusts
Wound you, it is plain to me
There are things you’ll never see.
You are mine. She must have guessed it.
She confessed it.
You can’t be much like her, kid.
For w r e know what Mother did.
Mother soon forgot you with a man.
Mother left you, left you, for a man !
Made herself a (whisper!) for a man!
Didn’t know what love was. Only
talked.
Didn’t care what, mud was when she ran
Down the rut where shrewder lechers
walked.
Comes the day when I must tell you
What befell you,
How your Dad’s strong heart was broken
(though he hides it when lie can).
How he bowed his head ’mid cuckolds built
upon the other plan,
When the woman w T hom he trusted went off
with another man,
When she made fine sport for devils to be
fondled by a man,
When she made God weep in Heaven as she
kissed another man !

MARY E. SURRIDGE.
A Double Runaway.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MILLY and the young man with the
peremptory voice had just had a
tremendous quarrel in the railway
carriage. The latter was beside himself.
“Hereafter say what you please-—do as
you like —go where you will —live where you
want to!” he foamed. “Before w r e can be
anything to each other again my terms are
unconditional surrender .”
“Unconditional surrender —to you —why,
I’d trade you away for a native-bear any
day!”
It was then that Jackson, the farmer, and
his two fat girls opened the carriage-door
and beamed on Miliy.
“You’re Miss Dennis, my new ’ousekeeper,
hain’t you?” said Jackson.
Miliy was not Miss Dennis: she bore a
message from that lady, who was ill.
But Jackson was such a queer apparition,
long and lanky, with lantern jaws over-run
with red scrub, that she flashed a glance at
the young man with the peremptory voice,
unconsciously ready, if he showed the slight-
est sign of friendliness, to laugh with him
at the ungainly farmer’s mistake.
He looked back at her as if she were an
absolute stranger.
Miliy felt ashamed of her mute capitula-
tion : she wished intensely for the moment
that she was Miss Dennis and going away
with Jackson and his fat girls.
And there was Jackson waiting with that
admiring look on his face.
“You’re lookin’ for Martin Jackson, hain’t
you?” he said eagerly.
“Yes, I w r as looking for you, Mr. Jackson,”
said Miliy nervously—and still delayed
giving her message.
“Right-oh !” said Jackson quickly. “These
uns is May an’ Mag—the girls I want vou
to look after, Miss Dennis. This is your
luggage, hain’t it?”
And he laid violent hands on her case and
rug and cushion.
Miliy, protestingly trying to reclaim them,
shot a glance now at the young man with
the peremptory voice, commanding his pro-
tection.
But he glared at her standing helplessly
there, suddenly bereft of all her possessions
as if she w r ere a natural enemy as well as
an absolute stranger!
Miliy wsent red and white. This was too
much! But though her world was rocking
she stood firm. She looked hard at the
basilisk face in the carriage, deliberately
drew her wedding-ring from her finger, threw
it contemptuously into her bag and followed
the farmer and the girls.
Jackson had his spring-cart outside the
station fence. Miliy had not ridden in one
before, and the high step looked formidable,
but she climbed in bravely and sat on the
plank next to Jackson, while the girls
tumbled into the back.
They were off.
The plank was smooth and slippery, and
the road rough. But Milly’s soul was in
arms. She had expected to be pulled back
into the train, to ne snatched out of the
spring-cart by her husband’s eager arms. Bui
he nact done neither of those things Out
of the corner of her eye she had seen him
on the platform. He had left the train,
too. But that was all he had done. Appa-
rently he was quite content for her to take
Miss Dennis’s place.
“I am well rid of a man,” she told her-
self bitterly, "who quarrels over a tritip
and then —a fine natural protector—basely
deserts me!”
Some people might have thought that
Miliy had deserted 'her husband, but tin.-
was the way she looked at it.
"Springfield for scenery, Miss Dennis,”
said Jackson proudly. "Tney say ’ereabouts
—it was before my time —that an artist was
once seen paintin’ in these parts.”
“Mag can sing.”
It was a live-wire whisper from May at
Milly’s left elbow.
"Yes. Mag can keep a howl goin’ as long
as a dingo caught in a trap,” said Jackson
complacently. "Mag’s mouth is big enough
to sing two songs at once!”
“May can dance.”
This time it was an explosion from Mag
at Milly’s right elbow.
“Yes, they climb trees in these parts to
see May dance,” agreed Jackson.
Miliy soon found that to_ please the Jack-
sons she had only to praise their exploits
and admire their scenery.
“Springfield for trees, Miss Dennis,”
chuckled Jackson. “Most things happen be-
hind trees at Springfield. No need for hotels
when they’re around. We cut our corns and
trim our whiskers behind the trees.”
"May says you can keep your hair in a
box and your teeth in a bag,” said Mag
suddenly.
“May is a bright girl,” laughed Miliy.
“Yes, it’s a wonderful age for carryin’
your features round in your pocket, instead
of scattered over your ’ead in the old-
fashioned way,” said Jackson.
“Mag can ride buckjumpers,” said May
exultingly.
“Mag can ride a ’orse with its bloomin’
tail on fire,” said Jackson. “Yes, Spring-
field for scenery, Miss Dennis. You’ve got
to burn down a street of shops in town to
see scenery. Look out, there’s a yaller
parrot!”
Miliy missed the parrot. But she flattered
herself that she was behaving as well as
the real Miss Dennis could have done.
She was doing her best to please the
Jacksons. And the Jacksons kept the won-
ders going and spared her nothing.
“May can milk 12 cows an hour,” said
Mag.
“May can milk 12 cast-iron cows an ’our,”
said Jackson.
“Mag can jump over a five-barred gate,”
said May.
“May’s 20 jumps in front of them all
’ereabouts,” said Jackson. “I’ve been a
widower six years, Miss Dennis.”
After a few minutes Jackson repeated the
information that he had been a widower six
years, and added that he had been married
twice, and after that he had as much to say
about his wives as the scenery. '
“Both my wives were crazy about me, Miss
Dennis,” he said. “It may be the other way
about with my third wife, says you. But I
don’t know. It’s a poor man can’t make three
women crazy about ’im, hain’t it? I was
always lucky in ioye. How about yerself?”
His voice was confidential and his eyes
flirtatious.
Milly’s spirits began to flag. Somehow
Jackson’s scenery seemed a safer subject
than Jackson’s wives.
“I met the first Mrs. Jackson at a weddin’
spree—an’ she never let go of my ’and all
that night,” said Jackson. “She ’ad yaller
’air like yours, an’ when she died every
tooth in ’er ’ead was ’er own! Your figger
reminds me of the second Mrs. Jackson. She
was tall an’ slender”
“The girls say we are nearly at your
home.” interrupted Miliy.
“There’s Jacksonville,” said the girls,
pointing at a little house on a hill quite
close to them.
“Yes, there’s your new ’ome, Miss Dennis,”
said Jackson grandly. “Hain’t it got a
friendly look? We’re bound to be ’appy up
’ere—ivith the firewood growin’ all round
us an’ no one to stop us rollin’ under the
fences an’ nothin’ to spoil our view of the
scenery. This is Life—up ’ere with the
scenery. Yes, ’ere you are, Miss Dennis —
an’ ’ere for good, perhaps.”
Miliy laughed uneasily at the amiable
forecast. She looked back at the long road
from the station. But no one was driving
frantically to overtake her. No one was
riding furiously to her rescue. And all at
once she felt tearful and lonely—in spite of
the spirit of adventure.
Jackson pulled up the horse. They had
arrived.
Miliy and the girls tumbled out and went
into the house: Jackson disappeared some-
where with the horse and cart.
Miliy found herself in a strange world.
She jumped -when she put her hand on a
frog sleeping on the table. And she screamed
when a cow thrust its head through the
window and gazed at her.
May and Mag laughed and nudged each
other with conscious superiority.
“Wait till you see the horned wallabies
and spitting dingoes at the back door,” said
May. and they laughed and nudged again.
The quaint conceit of the Jacksons, in
themselves and their belongings, enveloped
them in an armor of triple brass.
“We’ll shake you up!” said Mag. “You
saw trees and creeks and cattle-tracks to-
day. You see nothing in town but iron
chimneys and crooked telegraph-poles.”
“There’s nothing in town.” declared May,
“but a mob of pasty-faced girls and pie-
faced fellows. Send them out to catch a
horse and thev’d bring home a calf. They
can’t even hold on to things. The papers
are full of rewards for what they drop.”
Jackson came in and showed Miliy round
the place proudly.
It was a plain slab house with no archi-
tectural pretensions except a tall brick chim-
ney that stood alone in solitary grandeur,
and which the little house leaned against
like a poor relation. But Jackson had built
the chimnev and the house, and could not
forget that he had built them. He had made
the furniture, too. and he praised his work
until the girl from the city of electric lights,

MOST WONDERFUL
Test Zam-Buk on any Cut or Sore.
THE unparalleled success of Zam-Buk comes from
a unique scientific blending of certain herbal
extracts —the result of careful research for a healer
superior to and without the known drawbacks of
fatty ointments and salves.
There is nothing else at all like Zam-Buk. Cheap salves depend on
lard and other animal fats that turn rancid in our climate, choke-up the skin
pores, and leave your disease worse than before. They also often contain
mineral poisons that are a source of real danger to the skin.
On the other hand, Zam-Buk is guaranteed free from all animal fat and mineral
poison. Zam-Buk prevents a sore place taking “bad ways,” kills off dangerous germs,
and ensures speedy, permanent healing.
Zam-Buk is not a new untried preparation. Its proved wonderful healing qualities have made
it famous the world over, both as a first-aid for cuts, wounds, burns and scalds, and as a soothing,
speedy remedy for eczema, ringworm, ulcers, abscesses, piles, scalp sores, poisoned wounds, and all
irritable or inflamed conditions of the skin.
Don’t experiment with cheap, worthless imitations. Get this pure Zam-Buk for all your skin
troubles and injuries. Of all chemists and stores.
HEALER
Zam-Buk Medicinal Soap is specially prepared to meet the
needs of those suffering with a diseased or irritable skin. It
is invaluable when used with Zam-Buk Balm for the. cure of
slcin troubles. -

A MOTHER’S GRATITUDE TO ZAM-BUK.
Mrs, A. Allen, of King Street, Burnie,
Tasmania, says“A severe outbreak of
eczema appeared on the ears, of my son
Lewis. The sores discharged freely, and if
we got them to heal a little they soon broke
out again every bit as bad as ever. After we
had expended a lot of money on other treat-
ments I was persuaded to give Zam-Buk a
trial. The very first dressing of thi* sooth-
ing balm subdued irritation almost instantly.
Further applications cleansed the sores, drew
away all inflammation and healed Lewis's
skin splendidly. ”

electric trams, motor-cars, telephones, special
editions and beauty parlors felt quite limp.
"If I could take tuis ’ouse bodily to town
I’d get a lot of money for it,” declared the
author of the place. “The chimney alone
would bring me a small fortune. I’d build
all the chimneys round ’ere only the brick-
layers’ union might be after me. An’ these
chairs are as strong as drays, an’ as hand-
some as that yaller parrot I showed you.
When I plane their corners down a bit they’re
ready for a shop window. Ah, you’ve got to
come to the bush to see ’ow things are done!
That chimney an’ these chairs”
Milly escaped from Jackson and his chim-
ney and chairs to prepare for tea. They had
given her a room to herself, and in the soft
fading light it looked a haven of peace. She
moved about restlessly. Visions and regrets
were crowding upon her—not unconnected
with a young man with a peremptory voice.
But she dared not think of him.
“Can I hide away here for a few days?”
she murmured. “That will give me time to
make some plans for the future. I can
easily vanish down that road to the station
when I am ready. I wonder if I can risk
it? No one else wants me”
She leant sadly out of the window. And
the view of hills and trees hidden in a little
mist was so calm and peaceful that she
faced the Jacksons again in a chastened
spirit.
Tea was laid in the kitchen —a room
which had strayed some yards from the rest
of the house. And the walls were black
with smoke, and there was a hole in the roof
for a chimney and a hole in the Avail for a
window.
They sat on benches round the table, and
Jackson talked all the time. He held a
cup of tea in one hand and a scone poised
in the other, but it was seldom they reached
their destination in a hurry. Just as they
got within coo-ee of his whiskers he thought
of something thrilling to tell about himself,
and balanced them for a while again. The
tAVo great events of his life —when a tree
fell on him. and AAhen he bounced from tin 1
top of a house—were dilated on with a
Avealtli of graphic detail.
The tea and scones were good, and Milly
was hungry. The girls pressed her to eat
Avithout any further ceremony than a kick
under the table.
“Kick her uoav !”
Milly heard Hu' word of command passed
from May to Mag, and Avas filled Avith appre-
hension until she found that a kick meant a
scone, and then she cherished her bruises.
After tea they still sat round the kitchen
table, and Jackson kept on talking.
“I’ve told these girls. Miss Dennis.” he
said, “that they are to wait on you ’and
an’ foot, an’ obey every word you say.
There’s uo need for you to Avet your fingers.
It’s a poor family that can’t keep one lady.
Yes. ’ere avc are, us four, alone in this beau-
tiful bush, an’ we’ve got nothin’ to do but
make each other ’appy. An’ we’ll do it. too.
by the way we’re runnin’ now.”
The spirit of adventure seemed to flv from
Milly when she heard that affectionate
speech.
“An’ to-morrer after breakfast. May,”
went on Jackson, “you can go up the ranges,
you an’ Mag, an’ look for that lame cow.”
"Will they be away long? ' Miny asked.
“All day,” declared May.
“Then I’ll go with you,” said Milly. : “I
couldn’t stay here alone all day.”
"You won’t be alone,” said Jackson reas-
suringly. "I’ll be at ’ome all the mornin’
an’ in an’ out all the time.”
Milly made an excuse to escape to the
verandah. She wanted to think this aspect
of the next day over. She sat on the bench
feeling very forlorn and desperate and miser-
able.
"You come home I”
A head appeared over the fence. It was
the young man with the peremptory voice
- —the young man in the train who had last
looked at her as if she were a natural enemy
as well as an absolute stranger.
Milly’s first impulse was to fly to him.
But she remembered her wrongs and re-
mained silent and motionless.
Jackson's accents came from the kitchen
like a blast from a croupy cornet.
“Yes. you girls an’ me can make Miss
Dennis ’appy up ’ere. We don’t want ’er
to work—just to be ’appy. This is Life—
up ’ere with the beautiful scenery. An’ Miss
Dennis may be the mistress of this place
before long”
Milly’s outraged feelings were forgotten
in the hideous visions conjured up by Jack-
son’s prophecy. In a few minutes she Was
outside the gate and slipping down the road
beside the young man with the peremptory
voice.
“Unconditional surrender, indeed!” she
cried. “That was a nice thing to say to
me! No wonder I ran away with Jack-
son !”
“Trade me away for a native-bear, would
you?” he retorted. “A nice dance you’ve led
me, Milly. dodging about and following you
all day. But never mind. The great thing
is that you are running away with me now.”
“I’m not.” said Milly with a happy smile.
“I’m running away from Jackson.”

Paddy Mann.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ A RE veh acquaint wid Paddy Mann, son
/-% iv Patsy Mann, was an impedent
bit iv a bye livin’ hereaway in Bun-

on his own responsibilities in an ould log

"There’s a rough bit iv a bush bunk in

“Wan man enthers, ’n’ sits himself be

Sayin’ this same the man Carne shpills the

wid bitter sarcasm. ‘ ’N’ put out the light,
