The Red Page
The Modern Mahan
Professor Geoffrey Callender must with-
out doubt have been assisted in the writing
of The Naval Side of British History (Chris-
tophers, London) by the magnificent and in-
spiring surroundings in which he was able
to write. For he is Professor of History
at the Royal Naval College at Greenwich,
that solid pile iof beautiful Wren buildings
on the Thames opposite the Isle of Dogs and
hard by the Observatory where G.M.T. comes
from. We can imagine the Professor visit-
ing the Painted Hall where the Nelson relics
lie, and where Romney and Gainsborough
portraits of famous old seamen are hung to
provide the present and future generations
with naval inspirations. His, however,
was no headachy hunt for a phrase, for tiro,
whole book gives a vivid impression of having
flowed smoothly from his pen-point with the
effortless continuity of the student who knows
his sqbject and can set it down in plain
words.
Had Mahan not already chosen “The In-
fluence of Sea Power upon History” as the
title of his famous text-book, Callender would
. undoubtedly have selected it, but rather than
the name lie has chosen would I have called
this inspiring book “The Business Side of
Naval History.” For we have here no tire-
some record of personal heroism, the memory
of which,is best retained through the medium
of such verses as Kipling’s' and Newbolt’s,
but a clear, concise and eminently under-
standable tracing of the influence of the
Royal Navy on the History of the World.
There is not a technical phrase in the whole
book, and no tedious recital of the tactics
of the various naval actions which, owing
to the vast changes that have taken place
in ships and weapons, are boresome even to
the naval student of the present day. Thus,
tor example, does Callender describe one of
Blake’s victories over 23 Portuguese ships:
"Blake, with eight sail, attacked immediately,
sent one to the bottom, captured seveu, and
put the rest to headlong flight.” And again :
“The. remainder sighted Blake, and with
drooping wings sought asylum in Carthagena.
Thence on a day of tragedy for themselves
they darted out in search of their admiral,
and as they did so, Blake leaped on them
and drove them to destruction on the rocks.
Not one escaped.”
Callender deals all through his book with
reasons, results and effects while ensuring
continuity by omitting almost entirely the
details of actual battles except in so far as
such are necessary in order to understand
the evolution of the man-of-war from the
armed merchantman to the modern Dread-
nought. That is why I call this book a
“Business” book. Tlie English kings were
wise enough—or enough of them were so,
for some allowed the Navy to languish almost
to the point of extinction —to realise that
sea-borne trade was England’s life-blood
and that it had to be protected. And what
was true when the mediaeval English strained
every nerve to prevent Antwerp in the hands
of a strong Continental .power from super-
seding Ixmdon as the entrepot of Europe and
the clearing house for overseas trade is true
to-day. It was to keep London’s most dan-
gerous rival from falling into powerful
French or German hands that Belgium was
created an independent State in 1839, and
it was to preserve her neutrality and to pre-
serve Antwerp for the Belgians that the Em-
pire went to Avar in 1914. It was purely a
business matter to start Avitli, but sentiment
for a small and comparatively defenceless
country provided the Empire with its rally-
ing cry. For, as Callender says, “tAvo bonds
unite England and her Empire—affection
and battleships.” And the affection extends
not only to British peoples but to others to
whom England has guaranteed protection.
Without in any Avay seeming to discount
the value of personal heroism, Professor Cal-
lender obviously belongs to the school which
sets greater store by brain than by brawn.
The familiar picture of the naval heroes of
old, performing mighty deeds of valor, is
totally absent from this Naval History.
But the other side of the picture, the hours
and days and years devoted to thought and
to the intense study of the problems of the
moment, is heavily stressed, and we are forced
willingly or unwillingly to tin- conclusion
that if military battles such as Waterloo were
won on the playing fields of Eton, naval
battles Avere won by the light of midnight
oil expended in the constant application of
brain power to the changing tactics of the
day. We have here no picture of Nelson
heroically risking his life at AJboukir by tak-
ing on overwhelming odds. On the other
hand the famous admiral is shown deliber-
ately avoiding tlie “Nelson touch,” and, in-
stead of attacking French ships still disen-
gaged, Ave find him ranging his rear division
mi one side of the enemy’s van ships
which were already engaged on the other
side by tlie English van, in accordance with
a carefully studied plan Avhich, as Nelson
said, AA r ould spell “not victory, hut. conquest.”
As a commentary to this tribute to naval,
brain as being more potent than physical
valor, it might be pointed out that during
the Great War tAvo admirals signally failed
—'Craddock and Beatty. I am aware that,
according to many, this stricture ou the
latter may be resented; but Sir Reginald
Bacon, in “The Jutland Scandal.” leaves,
no room to doubt that Beatty failed. Both
Craddock and Beatty were exponents of the
Avorship of physical exercise as against study ;
in fact, Churchill openly prides himself on
having selected Beatty for the battle-cruiser
command because he was a hard rider to
hounds, although the Navy up till then would
have none of him.
The fact that naval battles and campaigns
can only be won by giving deep prior con-
sideration to all the relevant facts and fac-
tors first found literary expression in
Admiral Kempenfelt’s “Signal Book,” Avhich
superseded the fragmentary and umvritten
code in use up till its year of publication,
1782. This famous book enabled Lord Howe
to “shepherd his relief force Avitli a perfec-
tion of management that would have amazed
sea-commanders of pre-Kempeufelt days.”
and we read also that after the victory of
Cape Spavtel in 1782 Howe “gave Heaven
thanks that the ‘Signal Book’ had proved a
success.” Up till this it had been necessary
for every captain to divine the C.-in-C.’s
intentions either from liis movements or
otherwise, /and stereotyped tactics had to be
adhered to in consequence. The Signal Book
gave the Flagship a power of speech whose
value could not be over-estimated. But little
did even Kempenfelt think that early in tlie
Great War the Signal Book Avould have be-
come many books and many codes, and that
in fact at one time a signalman or coder had
to be able to recognise to exactly what page
in which of many books to turn in order to
decode one of the 85 differently-formed
groups of letters that Avere to be found there-
in.
But to Australia the greatest interest of
this enthralling book will lie in that part
describing Raleigh’s visualisation of an
overseas Empire. To use Callender’s words,
“Raleigh’s pet scheme Avas the establishment
overseas of a colonial empire, a union of Eng-
lish-speaking, English-loving Dominions. lie
desired to call into being new worlds to re-
dress the balance of the old; and, in traffic
w-i-th trans-oeeanic Dominions, he wanted
the ships of England to multiply until the
Cross of St. George was the best-known flag
in all the Seven Seas.” That vision is
a reality, and to-day avc reap the secure
benefit of the battles whose names look down
on the quarter-decks of men-of-war that are
not only English but British.
X. N. O.
The Mind of the Communist
Fortunately, in most instances, tlie aver-
age adult has become reconciled to the .fact
that lie is average: The normal youth con-
siders himself unique and the mental, moral
and physical superior of his companions.
This state of mind is admirable and normal
and has made for human progress. It de-
pends upon the balance between his intel-
lect, will and logic and, to some extent, upon
his environment how soon, if ever, he applies
tlie lessons of experience and reconciles him-
self to the common fate of being average. In
most cases a balance is established, and,
after a few years of kicking against the
. pricks, he settles down to a life of average
happiness. These are the fortunate of the
earth. Some few are born with a brilliant
intellect and with Avill and judgment above
the average. They are abnormal, correspond-
ing to “sports” in biology, and are known to
the world as. geniuses.-, A-few unfortunates
remain in the psychic state of their child-
hood. They begin life with the normal feel-
ing of superiority, but when they experience
what should teach them that they are at
about the normal level, their deficient will
and judgment cause them to rebel. They be-
come acutely conscious of differing from their
companions, and gradually develop an inferi-
ority complex. Their intelligence develops,
but tlieif inherent weakness of will and
judgment remains. They are invariably and
inordinately vain.
The normal desire for tlie approval and
praise of their fellows is exaggerated in the
case of people of the last-mentioned type,
and, failing to obtain it, they crave for notice
and attention at any cost. This craving,
lacking, on account of their defective will, its
natural inhibition, manifests itself in child-
hood as “showing off,” or acts of naughti-
ness, and explains the school bully. Later
in life it accounts for the girl whose thwarted
craving for notice cause's her to invent gro-
tesque stories of assault, and the boy who
is discovered self-bound and gagged, with a
sensational tale of attempted robbery. This
condition presents many of the elements of
insanity. Civilised races segregate and treat
those cases only which are dangerous to
other's or are entirely incapable of conform-
ing in their conduct to the customs of society.
Those of these unhappy and unbalanced in-
dividuals who are not considered insane in
the certifiable sense,, with intelligence at or
above the average, but with will and judgment
below par, develop a pathological conceit as
a shield and protection against their know-'
ledge of inferiority. Just as a very shy
person so frequently appears to be gruff and
morose, or a very sensitive individual de-
velops an armor of apparent callousness, so
do these unfortunate but dangerous, indi-
viduals assume,: as a protection against their
environment, an intense and ever-present
appetite for notoriety, and they are as
utterly without scruple in the means they
employ to attain their desires as is the drug
addict. This class includes religious bigots,
the mediaeval martyrs, and, in' civilised
countries, communists and anarchists. Their
intelligence enables them to discover means
by which they can achieve notoriety, find so
satisfy to some extent their overwhelming
vanity aiid soothe their consciousness of in-
feriority. Their enthusiasm is contagious
and their blindness to all but their immedi-
ate object serves to gain a following, consist-
ing partly of fellow sufferers, partly of the
more stupid and less educated. Another class
of follower is attracted by the hope that, by
attaching themselves to a new freak religion
or by joining inner revolutionary circles,
they may gain, in the event of its success,
some material benefit. They are, and realise
that they are, failures in their present en-
vironment; they have little or nothing to
lose, and imagine that they have much to
gain. {Even the relatively successful' are
never revolutionaries.)
Domain orators with freakish • systems of
politics or religion gather an .amused or tol-
erant audience ; their vanity is thus satisfied,
and they are usually of little , or no import
ance. Dignitaries of the churches and poli-
ticians suffering from this complex are actu-
ated by similar motives, and endeavor to
satisfy their vanity by press publicity ; and
it matters not to them if such notice, is hos-
tile.- They are a nuisance.gnd sometimes
dangerous. Those to whom chance or en-
vironment, offers Communism .as the,handiest
means of attempted self-expression become

The Long Haul
THE first Republic truck ever built still
does active daily duty, But it is only
one of the first hundred, the first
thousand, the first ten thousand Republic
trucks, most of which are still rolling up earn-
ings long after being completely charged off,
They are the pioneers of modern haulage.
They total with the volume of Republic sales
to-day to give Republic more trucks in use
than any other exclusive truck maker.
These untiring old Republic trucks early
established the economy and endurance
records which made “road freight” practi-
cal. Beating even traditional Republic
economy is the highest attainment of the
latest Republic models.
To do it takes the finest engines that ever
powered Republics; the most efficient type
of axle ever used; brakes such as no truck
ever had; and a host of refinements in oil-
ing, cooling, frame, controls and bodies.
The Improved
Republic improves
the position o f
every Republic
dealer. The truck
and the organisa-
tion are fit for the
long haul. The
complete line of
Improved Republic
models and the
broad Republic
franchise meet
every need.

a danger to the community. They are men-
tally as pathological and materially as dan-
gerous to their fellows as the criminal or
homicidal maniac, and it is as necessary to
isolate or otherwise render them harmless.
The average man is happy because he lias
the normal balance between intellect, will
and judgment; the stupid man is below the
average, the talented man above; the genius
has mental faculties developed to an abnor-
mal degree; but the anti-social communist
leader, the political or religious bigot, the
crank who seeks and enjoys martyrdom, the
person who seeks, by speaking in the Domain,
or by provocative words or deeds, to attract
press notice, and many of the inmates of
our gaols and asylums, are alike in that
they are suffering from lack of balance and
co-ordination of their mental processes, alike
also in their consciousness of inferiority and
in the consequent desire for notice.. It de-
pends partly on the degree to which they
lack balance, and partly on the mere chance
of their environment, whether they become
criminals, cranks or communists. In almost
all cases they are a menace to the com-
munity.
In considering the right method of hand-
ling them it must be realised that they are
innately unhappy, that their idea of happi-
ness is notoriety and that their vanity and
egotism make them unscrupulous as to the
means they employ in the attempt to achieve
their peculiar idea of happiness. They
thrive on publicity, hostile notice is the
breath of life to them, and, unfortunately,
the daily press is usually only too willing lo
supply them with almost as much breath as
they desire.
CARYSFORT.
Burns, the Exile of Erin
That Robert Burns should stand so brave
and lonely among the generations of Scotch-
men is a fact from which inferences are
seldom drawn at St. Andrew’s Night ban-
quets. It has never struck enthusiasts as
even curious that no Scotchman in the
smallest degree resembling Burns has ever
risen in that “land of brown heath and
shaggy wood,” while many figures move on
a stage not far away from his birthplace
which in personality, taste and general atti-
tude to life are very much like him. For
Robert Burns was born nearer to Ireland
than to Edinburgh, and, in spite of all the noises
made by Scottish throats, is every way more
of an Irish than a Scottish type. You can
carry the matter even to the appreciation of
his work. Wherever Scotchmen discuss
Burns you will find that without exception
they quote his commonplaces or his vul-
garities. The dull bits in his writing that
happen to carry a little crude local color
are always the favorites among his alleged
countrymen ; but for appreciation of the deli-
cate shades of his lyric thought you must
go to Irish or English readers.
The tract of country which Burns called
home was at one time in the kingdom of
Strath-Clyde, where the Cymri for a long
time maintained themselves against the Teu-
tonic invader; but when, in the Middle Ages,
the northern part of the territory passed
into the kingdom of Scotland it was thrown
into very close contact with Northern Ire-
land. When evil days fell upon Scotland
men slipped easily across the 13 miles of
sea into Ireland for refuge ; and in the ter-
rific disturbances of the top corner of Ire-
land by the murderous onslaught of I)e
Lacey and others whole families took
shelter in Galloway and waited for a
chance to return. In some cases we
know that the Irish refugees stayed
away for half a century; and we may
reasonably argue from such delay in re-
turning that some of them stayed away alto-
gether. Thus it becomes almost certain that
a strong Irish strain exists in the blood of
Ayrshire. The strait was narrow enough to
cross in an open boat, and there were no
hatreds or’ even strong racial prejudices on
either side to make the crossing difficult.
That an Irish singer, using a Scottish
medium of expression, should arise in such
a region is no great matter for wonder. The
feeling for such a singer was in the blood
of the Ayrshire people; and it was in the
neighborhood of his home that Burns found
his chief appreciation.
But Burns did not belong to Ayrshire.
It was merely the environment in which
he was brought up and lived. His father’s
name was not Burns but Burn, the s being
added because such a name was so unfa-
miliar in Scotland. His father moved from
some unspecified place in the Highlands—
or said he did —and took a farm near Ayr;
but the attempts to trace a Burn family in
the Highlands have been a failure. Any
district would be very proud to point itself
out as the home of the poet’s ancestors, but
no district has been able to successfully make
the claim. That the elder Burn had been
in the Highlands as a bird of passage, and
had found a Highland wife there, seems
probable enough; but had search been made
in Ireland for the antecedents of a man
named Byrne who left that country for Scot-
land and finally settled in Ayrshire it would
probably have been attended by much greater
success. At any rate, the plain fact stands
that the poet’s father bore a name which is
either very rare or non-existent in Scotland,
and which is very plentiful in Ireland; and
the poet himself showed all the character-
istics of those of Irish descent and none of
the characteristics of the average Scotchman.
The inference seems clear. Hard as it is to
destroy an illusion so deeply cherished, there
would seem to be no doubt at all about the
fact that Robert Burns was Irish.
It is notable, too, that he fits exactly into
the line of Irish bardic descent, following
even in his bitter local satire the very
methods of the wandering singers across
the straits. Among Scotchmen he stands
isolated and utterly lonely, lie has been
the idol of the Scottish people for more than
a century; and yet whatever distinction the
best Scottish writers have gained none of
their work has ever been done along similar
lines to those which admittedly they admire,
most. Once again the clear inference is that
Scotland is in no real way kin to Burns in
thought or feeling. Had it been otherwise,
imitation of Burns would have been the
natural direction of a young Scottish mind.
It has been quite otherwise. Certainly there
are imitations of Burns of a sort —too many
of them —but none of these in all the years
has ever risen above the barest mediocrity.
Under the husk of broad Scottish dialect
which so many have tried to use, the emo-
tional note bears not the faintest resem-
blance to his. Yet so completely is the Scot-
tish mind incapable of grasping this fact that
quite recently a spurious piece of cheap sen-
timental verse in time Scottish vein was
accepted by thousands as from the pen of
Burns himself. Side by side with this must
be taken the other undeniable fact that much
modern Irish verse, though written without
dialect, shows a spirit and emotional color
in every way kindred to the best work of
Burns. It is therefore evident that the cen-
tury and more of applause which Scotland
has given to the exile in Ayrshire is a deli-
cate tribute to the higher mental and moral
qualities of the Irish nation.

Temperament in Art
E. Colclougli (R.P. 22/10/’25) brings us
no nearer to a solution of wliat is art
when lie declines to admit the influence of
temperament and emotion as potent factors in
determining the artist's vision. If art is not
emotion, temperament, then it defies defini-
tion. The fact is, one man paints, or sings,
or writes in such a way that he creates some-
thing which brings conviction and pleasure to
others. lie has a message for mankind.
Another does these tilings equally well, as
far as technical excellence is concerned -
perhaps even better but does not get
there.” What is the difference? One is a
matter of feeling, plus knowledge, the other
a matter of knowledge only. ,
The beauty or ugliness of an artist s tem-
perament has everything to do with the
expression of his art. But it must not be
forgotten that apart from artistic tempera-
ment the artist is neither better nor worse
than his fellows.
Jim Minogue’s notions of what constitutes
idealism and realism (R.P. 29/10/’25) are
altogether askew. Idealism does not mean
sentimentalism, nor docs it bleat for sugar.
It does not mean the art of making Nature
merely pretty. It connotes a sincere attempt
to discover 'the inward spirit of things as
opposed to the superficial the difference
between art and photography. Jim Minogue
lias not interpreted Velasquez and Millet
aright. These artists have given us the
character, the soul of their subjects—not
merely the outward form. Their work does
in a superlative degree express romance and
emotion, is full of divine fire, and is, there-
fore, art. For emotion, despite E. Col-
clough’s doubts and Jim Minogue’s scorn, is
emphatically inseparable from art. But that
does not imply either monotony or sentimen-
tality. Art is self-revelation. The artist
reveals himself in his work. No Australian
artist is so prodigally endowed with the
qualities of romance, emotion and tempera-
ment —as well as imagination —as Norman
Lindsay. But he is a bold man who has the
temerity to designate this artist a sentimen-
talist bleating for sugar ! .
We all see Nature through our particular
temperament, certainly, but it is given to
few to express their emotions, their feelings
in terms of art. To think otherwise is
inimical to reason. Those who believe they
can express the Truth in Nature without
emotion —by direct action are the Bol-
sheviks of art. Would you expect an artist
to express anything worth while in cold
blood without a thrill of emotion? Mere
technical excellence is not art, for the reason
that it is done in cold blood. You can only
express what you feel; and the measure of
your feeling is determined by the quality of
your temperament. If you feel nothing, you
can express nothing. You cannot express
more than you feel; indeed, you are lucky
if you can express all you feel. To express in
terms of art the emotion aroused within you
by a mood of Nature is oue thing; to convey
that emotion through the medium of your
work to the point of conviction to other
minds is another. If you accomplish it, you
have achieved art.
Every artist who has been admitted into
the Holy of Holies has discovered for him-
self the' harmonies of Nature, as Streeton
has done in Australia; but if temperament
has no influence in the expression of their
discoveries, why don't they all paint alike i
The fact is, they all “discover” differently.
Without the quality of receptibility they
could not make these discoveries; without
the quality of temperament they could not
convincingly express them each in his own
individual way. .
Not only the individual, but the national
temperament discloses itself with absolute
accuracy in its painting, literature and
music. But it is in music that the influence
of temperament is most obvious. Tempera-
ment gives us the many charmingly different
interpretations of the same theme; tempera-
ment, the power spontaneously to express
feeling in an individual way—that is what
makes the artist. Otherwise we should all
be mere painters, mere scribblers, mere per-
formers upon musical instruments, mere
voice-producers. Technical excellence alone
lacks power to create; it merely imitates.
You would not say, for instance, that
poetry is not emotion? If it is not emotion,
it is nothing. A hundred writers give us
reams of absolutely faultless verse which
is utterly lacking in artistic quality, for
one who touches the magic lyre and makes
irregular music and thereby achieves poetry.
You can teach the student to draw, but you
cannot teach him to become, an artist. You
cannot teach him color, for instance. Color
is a matter of individual temperament. A
man has it, or he has it not. It is a gift
of the gods just as much as song is a gift,
and the gift of words.
You can only approximate to truth, never
attain truth, with the inadequate media
’available, in the same way as you can only
approximate to truth with musical instru-
ments —never completely express the sky-
lark’s epithalamium, nor the sylvan melody
of the babbling brook. Nor, to take another
extreme, can you completely express the
viciousness of the slums. But you can go
very close to it—if you have imagination
and conviction, technical skill and a tem-
perament sufficiently sensitive to absorb the
spirit of ( vour subject. If you can do that.
you have achieved art; otherwise you ex-
press nothing but the cold calculations of
intellectual excellence.

A Satchel of Books
Y’Understand, by Montague Glass (Heinemann).
The author of “Potash and Perlmutter” found a rich
vein in the life of the Ghetto (American section).
The very human combination of vices and virtues,
avarice and cunning, kindliness and unexpected gener-
osities, makes a popular appeal. It is the antithesis
of highbrow, but the reader who is not catholic-
minded enough to get a laugh out of the farce is
wanting in some element of a normal make-up.
Torchb carers of Spiritualism, by St. Clair Stobart
(Allen and Unwin). The author contends that ail the
torchbearers of Divine truths became great teachers
because their psychic faculty put them in touch with
the spirit world, whence they derived their inspira-
tion. The possession of these psychic gifts enabled
them to accompany their teaching by signs and
wonders. How far Mrs. Stobart is warranted in the
conclusions drawn from the assumed facts must
be left to the reader to decide.
The Interest Standard of Currency, by Ernst Dick
(Allen and Unwin). This is an attempt by a Swiss
economist to formulate a new scheme to stabilise the
currency. The author puts it in a concentrated
form in the following sentence: “Keep the rate of
discount stable after having established it in its
right place, and leave everything else to find its
own place in a scale of values.” That is the whole
of the scheme, but to bring it about will involve
difficulties and re-adjustments that are fully dis-
cussed.
Arnold Thomas, by Nathaniel Micklem (Allen and
Unwin). Bristol, one-time centre of trade in niggers
and rum, does not suggest a spiritual atmosphere. It
was nevertheless in this ancient city of sin and
sailors that the subject of the memoir by Mr. Micklem
was born and spent a lifetime in the service of
Congregationalism. He was cousin to that D. A.
Thomas who afterwards became Lord Rhondda. Dr.
Thomas belonged to the broad school of parsons, and
took his religion in much the same spirit as Dr.
Johnson’s friend took another branch of thought when
he remarked that he had once tried to be a philosopher
but “cheerfulness would keep breaking through.”
Indian Dream Lands, by Margaret Mordecai (Put-
nams). These sketches of Asiatic life and character
are not the superficial observations of the average
tourist. The author, who has already published “A
Key to the Orient,” is one of those who think the
British rulers have not always taken sufficient trouble
to reach the native mind. “But when all is said
and done, since the many and varied races which
make up the population of Hindustan have lost their
independence, thev are fortunate in being under
British rule rather than that of any other Power.
They [the British rulers] do their best to treat
them justly, according to their lights, and that is
more than* can be said of most cases of European
rule over native races.”
A Son of His Father, by Harold Bell Wright
(Appleton). A preacher turned novelist, this writer
of best-sellers appeals to a numerous body of readers
who like to take their fiction with a conventional
religious motive informing its substance. Nor does
it lose in virility and human interest on that
account, for by liis skill the novelist suggests rather
than preaches his moral. In this his latest book
he continues the success which was attained by
“The Shepherd of the Hills” and a long list of
subsequent works. The reader will find in Nora
O’Shea, the young Irish emigrant, whose fruitless
mission to join a brother in the new land con-
stitutes the motive of the plot, the quite impossibly-
perfect she of his imagination.
The Trial of Jesus, by John Masefield (Heinemann).
Mr. Masefield, greatly daring, has undertaken a task
that has in its conception the elements of failure.
The drama in construction follows the Greek model,
the links between the several acts being supplied by
the Chorus. The trial court is conducted on the
English procedure, witnesses being sworn as they
would be in our courts to-day, “depositions” are pro-
duced and Vc'ounsel conducts the prosecution. Even
the death sentence has a familiar sound —“that you be
taken lienee at once beyond the city walls, and there
hanged upon a cross until you be dead. May the
gods have mercy on your soul.” The play has many
beautiful and poignant passages in it, and seeks to
present in dramatic form the biblical account with
intensification but without irreverence. That it would
fail was inevitable.
Round the World with a Circus, by George Wirth
(Troedel and Cooper). “While many struggle sel-
fishly for wealth, often depriving others of their
fair share of this world's goods, the honest show-
man toils to bring laughter to young and old.”
Thus moralises the author in presenting his
“Memories of trials, triumphs and tribulations.”
Wirth Bros.’ circus has in the course of many years
become more than a travelling show; it' has
flowered into an Australian institution. The story
of how it was worked up from the humblest be-
ginnings to its present dimensions —its menagerie last
year held no less than 12 elephants—is told by
the author in a plain narrative bristling with items
of professional experience with a genial thread of
human interest running through it all. Though
owning Australia as its homeland Wirths’ Circus has
traversed great portions of the outer world —South
Africa, South America, Maoriland, New Caledonia
and the eastern coast of Asia —and it was the first
Australian show of its kind to pitch its tents in
England. An interesting little record of what can
be done by pluck and enterprise.
Memories of Life and Art, by Walter Shaw Sparrow
(John Lane). The author’s reminiscences, covering a
wide field of experience in literature, the arts and
the stage, are spread over 60 yearn. Within that
time “many surprises have come from the; changing
tides of art’s wayward fashions and some very
remarkable improvements have been achieved. Yet
the general position, since the days when I first
became conscious of it. has remained approximately
the same in our country. There have been many
differences, but art has not yet been made real
again as a fellowship of enjoyment common to the
whole people.” Whilst England has to-day at her
command a larger number of trained artists than
ever in the past, they live apart from the industrial
world. “Their value to the State would bo inestim-
ably useful if their productions could be ‘made
genuinely economic, and therefore of every-day
service to all classes of the community.” The
effect of the war, with its aftermath of debt iand
taxation, has told heavily upon artists. “Sales at
public exhibitions have become so meagre, generally,
that easel-painters who remain loyal to their colors
need the courage of forlorn hopes.” Again, “If
art is to be once more an essential part of daily life,
her devotees must remember always that. . . .archi-
tecture and her handicrafts need much more atten-
tion than pictures.” The author devotes some
interesting chapters to his student life at the Slade
School of Art ; and Leighton. Watts, Burne-Jones,
Whistler, Rossetti and practically all the great painters
of the mid-Victorian age are sketched in the pages
of an interesting volume.

“Adamascus”: Professor Stable, of Queensland
Uni., is responsible for “The Bond of Poetry,” a
book set down for study next year in Queensland
secondary schools. The collection, which is notable
for the number of purely Australian poems in it,
is divided into three classes —narrative, descriptive
and patriotic. The first contains Lawson, Marcus
Clarke, Paterson, Gordon and the less-known Alice
Werner; the second, Lawson, Arthur Adams,
Ogilvie, Rod. Quinn, David McKee Wright, Boake,
Mary Hannay Foote and Kendall; the third Lawson,
Arthur Adams, Quinn again, Brunton Stephens,
Dorothea Mackellar, Bernard Dowd and Heney. The
collection, which will give the Queensland young-
ster a chance of comparing the work of Australians
with that of the greatest of British poets, while
primarily meant for use in schools, is worthy of a
place on any book-shelf.

Models from £420.
FROM every corner of the world, accounts
are received of the splendid service
Studebaker cars are rendering in the
most gruelling types of service.
In Northern Queensland, a Studebaker has
been used for over six years to link outback
settlements to the railroad. In South Africa,
His Majesty’s mail is carried between Kimber-
ley and Kuruman by a Studebaker that has
traveled over 400,000 miles, but is still going
strong. In Detroit, the automobile capitol of
the world, 130 Studebakers are used in livery
service. And each has a record of over 100,000
miles.
Stupendous mileage! These cases are but a
few of the hundreds of veteran Studebakers.
Because Studebaker makes all of its own
bodies, engines, gear boxes, differentials,
clutches, steering gears, axles, drop forgings
and gray iron castings, the profits of outside
makers are eliminated. Savings effected enable
Studebaker to use better materials and finer
workmanship without charging prices in pro-
portion to quality.
And because Studebaker cars are built better,
they give longer, more dependable and more
economical service. It will pay you to inves-
tigate Studebaker cars before you buy.

Young Moon.
As soon as yellow day leaves the dull town
I love to see the snuall white moon look down
From evening’s clear and lilac-tinted sky.
As shyly as a girl wakened to love,
As frightened as a little quivering dove,
Reluctant, yet in liasite its wings to try
Upon the blue and shining leagues of space.
I love her little white dream-haunted face.
I wonder what she thinks when, from a tree,,
She peeps in wistful curiosity
Down on our little green and glowing earth.
I think at times I've- sleen a gentle mirth
Shake her as lightly as a bee a flower,
Seeking his treasure through a transient
hour.
I’ve often wondered, little wistful moon,
Who is your lover. For once, far and high,
I heard the young wind near your lilac sky
Tenderly piping a thin .silver tune!

“Oh, stay just a while and live with me!
My heart is sad and the fire burns low
And the light from my house of dreams has

Ere you tried your win;gs;
All will I do but set yo a free!” ,
So I kept it close, nor would let it go;
Blit my sweet little song- is dead!

If I should die and you should find my dying
Father to fears and parent to new pain
Within your heart, dim not your eyes with
crying,
But go into the woods ; and when again
The spring comes north and bird with bird
is mating
I will be in the trees’ soft shade —and
waiting.
I will be chained and none on cai;th shall
free me.
I will not speak; there will be naught to
show
Where I am standing, and you will not see
me.
Only by this one token will you know
That I am near; soft breezes will enfold
you ;
They will be I who light as air shall hold
you.

Dream Gardens.
I shall dream gardens wherever I sleep!
If Chance make my ted in the open sea
I shall dream gardens, wherever I be
On the shifting sands where the samphires
creep.
In the wash of waters by cape and rock
Or an islet fringed with a coral reef
I shall find a pleasan.ce of bloom and leaf,
A wild red rose and a milk-white stock.
Violets, like those you used to bring,
Lilies, pale gold for a golden bee —
I shall plan a hive ne.ath the tumbling sea
For brown striped body and gauzy wing..
For I must have bees in my mignonette.
When I find wide beds of it in the blue,
With dusty helmets Avhere jsun soaks
through,
The flowers you tended will not forget!
I shall grow dream gardens wherever I
sleep.
Though they shape my couch of a cold
grey stone
And carve a cross where I lie alone,
There will be a chink where the grasses
peep
And the scattered buds of a wind-torn tree,
Bauhinia bright as butterfly,
Till a page will turn in a sunlit sky
And I read the blossoms that used to be.
In the crumbling clay, when the light has
gone,
I shall build me towers where the tall
palm stands;
I shall fill with myrtles my hungry hands
From the hanging gardens of Babylon.
In wandering ocean, in earth-ditch deep
I shall see green grass and the poppies
blow.
I may fail of Heaven ; but this I know,
God will plant gardens through all my sleep!

The After-glow.
Under a pile of papers, long laid by,
A small grey glove of silk, faded with age!
How came it there? I question memory.
She, gently, shyly, opens at the page.
I read the record of unsoiled romance —-
A youthful dream of love, from passion
clear—
Of one I saw but seldom and by chance,
But still so well remembered and so dear.
The day I found and kept it —blameless
theft —
Comes back with all its heart-throbs, fresh
as then,
And young love’s fears, of all but this bereft,
That never might I touch her hand again.
They say that boyish fancies are but slight.
Not so; our later loves more surely fade.
And as the noon is nearer to the night.
The glow of dawn lights up the twilight
shade.

IF BRUCE SHOULD SELL HIS
WINGS.
The Federal election campaign has given
Australia a higher opinion than it had of
the Prime Minister’s earnestness, eloquence
and physical and mental endurance. Now
it waits anxiously to see if he can go further
than the arrest of Walsh and Jolianson,
presumably with a view to deportation,
and develop the high hand and the hard
heart required in a land which has slid
so close to the brink of a bestial form
of revolution, and which may still go
over the brink if the victory isn’t utilised.
To win battles and lose the results is not
exactly as easy as losing battles or not fight-
ing at all, but it leads to much the same
disaster. If Prime Minister Bruce could
be absolutely depended upon to sell his pair
of angel wings, and buy something in the
way of hoofs and a tail with the money, Aus-
tralia would sleep more soundly o’ nights
than it has done for a good while. There
is no reason why he should sacrifice any of
his outward calm or (except under dire pro-
vocation) his politeness. He would be none
the stronger for descending into the arena
where adjectives rage and political fishfags
and uncouth crooks are gathered together.
But there is no room any longer for that
patience which gives the forces of disorder
90 yards start out of a hundred, or which per-
mits almost unlimited obstruction in the
name of the fetich of “free speech,” and
which lets down its friends lest it should
be charged, by persons who don’t count, with
“victimising” its enemies. Certainly the
arrest of the two seamen is promising; but,
after all, their offence was more or less
spectacular—it consisted not of preaching
and plotting general revolution, but of actu-
ally holding up various vessels on various
pretexts. The question still remains to be
answered whether the Government is pre-
pared to deal effectively with the enemies
w T ho conspire to bring about an upheaval
unconnected with any comparatively small
trade quarrel. The great crime is the defiance
or overthrow of constitutional government,
and the advocacy thereof; and there has been
far more of that in Queensland and else-
where than there has been under Walsh
and Johanson’s direction in Sydney or Mel-
bourne.
* -X- # * -
In all the world there is no white man's
country large enough to be identified which
gives foreign criminals and local dupes and
disreputables such absolute freedom to pl°n,
preach and practise upheaval. In Russia, which
has got back to savagery, even the suspicion
of an attempt at capsizing the Government
with a view to better things is spied out
early, and suppressed in a way which leaves
no room for doubt. In Great Britain the
person from overseas who is decided upon
as undesirable is shot out with such a
minimum of publicity that the number
of expulsions is wholly a matter of
doubt. The method is prompt, and the
desire for efficiency is so great that
new restrictions may be added to those iu
use without reference to Parliament. This
amounts to a blank cheque. As a provision
for the local Bolshevik product there are
vigorous laws and commodious gaols, and
recently 12 noisy advocates of Moscowism
were committed for trial on the same morn-
ing at the same London police court. The
raiding of Communist premises and the
seizure of books, papers and correspondence
have become common. The tendency in the
United States is to mark as serious crimes
membership of a Communist society and
the writing, speaking, preaching, printing or
in any way the propagating of revolutionary
doctrines and Red objectives. As a conse-
quence there were recently over 100 Bol-
sheviks doing sentences as much as 15 years
long in one State, and not one Bolshevik in
Congress. The wail of the Red Objective
person in Australia that tyrants propose
to come down like the falling tower of
Siloam on freedom of thought is quite be-
side the question. No objection is made
ii any person believes in the destruction of
the self-governing rights of his fellow-men,
in revolution and every possible crime that
goes along with it, or in cannibalism. But
even in the last case, which is of minor im-
portance as compared with the other two.
the Law, if it is worth calling Law, acts
strenuously to prevent the acquisition, sale
and consumption of human flesh, and its
advertisement and recommendation in the
Anthropophagous Gazette. If interfer-
ence with outward, visible, audible and
avowed cannibalism, or with any other de-
structive ism, is an outrage on liberty of
thought or speech—well, it must just go
at that.
* * * *
Should there arise, in influential Red quar-
ters, a fear that something serious may be
done to forestall the next Communist cam-
paign, and to make it impossible on any
noticeable scale, the most natural proceed-
ing will be a sudden smothering of activity.
Then it will be advanced that the danger
was absurdly over-rated, else it wouldn’t
have gone out of sight so completely; that
there never was any danger; that if there
was, the result of the elections is a com-
plete and sufficient victory, and that pur-
suit of the victory would amount to un-
manly panic. It may even be described as
unladylike hysteria. There will be pro-
tests against vindictiveness, against bearing
malice, and (fortified by quotations from
the New Testament) against the lack of for-
giveness on the Government’s part of other
people’s injuries. Much will be gained for
the bad cause (perhaps everything will be
gained) if action can be postponed till en-
thusiasm wanes, and till the short-memoried
public has forgotten many things in the ex-
citement of picking the right horse. If the
Prime Minister relapses into his old angelic
or winged frame of mind it is hard to say
what may happen. The Australian Central
(alleged) Government is in want of many
things, among them being (1) a real army;
(2) a capable police and detective force;
(3) its own civil and criminal courts (plenty
of them, on the United States principle)
and its own gaols; (4) a general extension
of its influence by the assumption and exer-
cise of all the latent po-wers conferred on
it by the Constitution; and (5) an unflinch-
ing policy by which the propagation of re-
volutionary or Communistic doctrines will
be punishable by deportation iu the case of
strangers, arid by imprisonment with depri-
vation of the franchise where local citizens
are involved. In a country where the
Supreme Legislature is wholly the creation
of the people the only possible form of suc-
cessful revolution is the rising of a truculent
minority, sufficiently provided with force,
against a majority with insufficient force
but a surplus of ballot-papers. A bigger or
smaller surplus makes little difference. The
only method by which even a small and
wholly unjustifiable insurrection can be put
down is by the use of violence, and it is up
to the Government to get and keep in stock
enough legitimate organised violence, legal
and physical, for the purpose.
SETTING THE STAGE.
“His Excellency the Governor-General shall be
respectfully requested to summon the first meeting
of the tenth Parliament at Canberra.” —Resolution
of the ninth Federal Parliament.
A few miles out of Cooma a homing squat-
ter took pity on our amateur packs and gave
us a lift. We were going to Canberra?
Well, he was passing through it. Once
owned the expletive place, or a good slice
of it. Somebody has to suffer when a coun-
try decides that its new-found dignity re-
quires expression in reinforced concrete, so
he was invited to move on. He moved a
couple of hundred miles to 250,000 acres at
Lake Cargellico. “It’s a place you can
swing a cat in, at any rate,” he shouted as
w y e tore past the holdings of the Cooma
cockies who farm pocket-handkerchiefs of
30,000 acres. There was our first; glimpse
of the Federal Territory. Cuppacumbalong
—immortalised by C. J. Dennis in a nur-
sery rhyme: he had shared it with old Fred
Campbell, who had gone off somewhere in
the direction of the lower Murrumbidgee.
Cuppacumbalong stretched a long blue-
wooded range on our left, and when it dipped
down towards the plain we turned and ran
into Queanbeyan. What a paradise for
some the money of the many makes when
the taxpayers’ heartstrings have been suit-
ably wrung! Queanbeyan isn’t in the Fed-
eral Territory, but it is alongside it, and
it booms as if Canberra had been another
Golden Mile. For the Territory is dry, and
the 3000 scene-shifters who are building at
Canberra the new settings for the tragi-
comedy entitled “Democratic Government”
come to spend their basic wage at Queanbeyan.
We ran past a hotel which, worth perhaps
£3OOO before the present dispensation,
changed hands the other day for £24,000, into
suburban Queanbeyan, which last year did
not exist. Our squatter was stirred to
angry rumblings. Suburban Queanbeyan
used to be a depot for his sheep brought in
from Cuppacumbalong, and the land which
he had sold at not very much per acre the
agents were now selling at so much per foot.
We bumped out of New South Wales
across a line of rails into Federal Territory,
and immediately the road took on the
smoothness of a city pavement. The last
time I had been on Commonwealth soil was
in Port Darwin, and the contrast between
that decaying settlement and this spoilt
darling of the Federal Treasury inspired
melancholy thoughts.
We ran parallel with the railway over a
fan-shaped plain whose handle ran up into
gently folding fingers of green hill. On the
right was the new power-house, ahead the
Administrative block, over there a forlorn
little garden suburb, on every side of us
empty avenues lined for miles with flower-
ing peach and cherry that wasted their
beauty on the untenanted fields.
“I jackerooed here 30 years ago,” the
squatter shouted, and then he rammed his
brakes on hard before a maze of pegs
marked “Commonwealth-avenue,” “Welling-
ton-avenue,” “Melbourne-avenue” and the
rest. “Damn it, I’ve lost my way!” We
slid down a broad highway whose immacu-
lateness was guarded by a notice, “Horse
Traffic Prohibited,” and stopped at the
Hotel Canberra. Shades of a hundred! seedy
country pubs! This glittering caravanserai
moved our friend to fresh murmurs of won-
derment and mistrust. What was the coun-
try coming at when it built a place like that
merely for politicians? He had often boiled
his billy on the spot where we now accom-
modated ourselves in Titanic armchairs and
rang for white-tuniced stewards.
An ex-Prime Minister was spending his
honeymoon in the vestibule. Here like an
old actor he could sit and watch the play-
house for his successors going up at a cost
of £250,000 across the way. Present-day
members, they told us, came here too, to
gloat over the scene of their future triumphs.
The place was full of the pioneers of the
new Canberra, who had the light of en-
thusiasm in their eyes and unprecedented
funds at their disposal; but in the billiard-
room, playing a forlorn game of snooker,
was a group that might almost have been
invested with a pathetic halo of romance.
They or their fathers had been the pioneers
of the old Canberra. One of them was
E. C. Crace, lank of limb and brick-red of
face, who gains a certain melancholy satis-
faction from being the first member of the
new Land Board, and who rents from the
Commonwealth the homestead he once owned.
Another was a descendant in the fourth gen-
eration of that Robert Campbell, of Cal-
cutta, first merchant adventurer of Sydney,
who became a blubber-and-seal trader at
Circular Quay, whose fleet was comman-
deered at a time of famine to fetch food from
India and was wrecked, and who was com-
pensated by a grant of land “beyond the
mountains.” Tall Trooper Ainslie was
sent with the compensation sheep to sit
down at Canberra in 1823. and Robert
Campbell followed to die, 1846, aged 77,
in the garden of Duntroon House, where
Australia’s Military College is now placed.
The present descendant of Canberra’s first
feudal lord now leases the land he w’orked,
and carpenters and bricklayers are convert-
ing his homestead into the Governor-
General’s residence. Somebody has to go
when a country rouses itself to a sense of
its importance ip terms of politicians. Half
a mile down the hill that slopes from Par-
liament House towards the Molonglo we
found Mrs. John Scott under her trellised
porch. Her father had been dairyman to
old Mr. George Campbell, and she was
over 60, and five of her nine boys were earn-
ing money “in the Government”; but she
was far from happy, for she no longer had
any cows to milk. Mrs. John Scott and
her trellised porch will have to go—it is not
mentioned on Burley Griffin’s plan—but
across the Molonglo and up the other side,
not far from Duntroon College gates, we
found something that can be preserved. It
is a picturesque old iron pot still full of
charcoal, with rusty horseshoes in it, and a
big bellows still capable of uttering a remi-
niscent sigh over the old days when it blew
on the iron heels of many a good horse from
Robert Campbell’s stable.
It was the best time to see the place be-
fore the new stage directors had reshuffled
the scenery to their liking. A lovely, low-
keyed picture it made in the still sunshine
of early summer: lofty snow mountains in-
conspicuous in the distance; the tops of
pallid willows mapping the winding course
of the Molonglo; sharp, high notes of pines:
and, like alien islands on the chart of the
new State-owned city and environs, the fine
old Campbell church, the Campbell rectory
and the square stone huts of the Campbell
shepherds and boundary-riders.
In the interesting churchyard we found
the records, covering a hundred years, of
a feudal system that the necessities of a more
crowded era have vanished. On the
tombstone of Sabah Webb (died Nov. 8,
1845) the spirit of prophecy has got to
work. “For here,” it says, “have we no
continuing city but we seek one to come.”
Whether Canberra is the city of the opti-
mistic sculptor’s dream is a matter for the
economists to wrangle over. It is certainly
a dignified stage-setting for the politician
to live up to.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The OutbacK Vote Comes In.
The Outback vote is in these days generally
hostile to the Labor party, and this year,
owing to the nation-wide feeling aroused by
the transport strikes, it has been more hos-
tile than ever. So the election returns
which came in from about the middle of
last week deepened the gloom which en-
veloped Mr. Charlton and his associates
after the early figures had been announced.
Instead of the 40 seats which they reckoned
on getting in the next House of Reps., they
will have, it now seems, only 23. Whereas
every Ministerial seat was held by a largely
increased majority, the Opposition has lost
Wannon (Vic.), Denison (Tas.), Angas
(S.A.) and Barton (N.S.W.), and has almost
abandoned hope in Gwydir (N.S.W.), where,
with preferences to be distributed, Cunning-
ham is 3000 to the bad. As regards the
Senate, Labor is 71,000 behind in N. S.
Wales, 73,500 in Victoria, 53,350 in Queens-
land, 24,700 in S. Aus.. 33,000 in Westralia
and 15,000 in the Speck. Incidentally,
N. S- Wales, S. Aus., Westralia, Tasmania
and Queensland enjoy the blessings of gov-
ernment by State Labor parties; Queensland
has enjoyed them since 1915. In Queens-
land E. G. Theodore, State Premier for five
years, and the hope! of his side, was rejected
by the Herbert electorate, which has six
Labor representatives and one anti-Laborite
in the State Parliament, and which he was
so confident of gaining that he said he would
be disappointed if his majority was less
than 5000. Dr. Nott, the new member,
fought a spirited campaign, but Theodore's
defeat is attributable to his pose of indiffer-
ence to the transport strikes. If he had
followed the courageous example of Ogden,
the Tasmanian Senator, he would have
won the seat. He seems to have persuaded
himself that Australia set a higher
value on “the solidarity of Labor” than on
its own interests and institutions; that the
nation whose sons were at the Gallipoli land-
ing, Pozieres, Bullecourt, Villers-Bretonneux,
Mont St. Quentin and the Hindenburg line
was abject enough to accept injury and insult
from a parcel of mob leaders, mostly immi-
grants of a poor type. He will know better
next time. If Watson, the Fremantle patri-
arch, can be called a Nationalist, the Nation-
alists will have 38 members in the new House
of Reps, and the Country party 14. Be-
cause of this, the Prime Minister has been
urged to cast the Cockies out of his Ministry
and put Nationalists in their places, notably
Hughes and Watt. The advice comes from
a quarter in which Bruce and Page were
blackguarded and ridiculed for years, and
periodically assured that the Labor party,
with Theodore in it, -would wipe the floor
with them in 1925; and no worse advice could
be given. The proposition is that the head of
the Government, being now assured of a
majority of 26 or 27, should exchange it for
no majority at all; that he should reject
faithful allies, without whose help he could
not have won the election, in favor of luke-
warm supporters; above all, that he
should tear up the scrap of paper known
as the Bruce-Page pact. That docu-
ment provided (1) that neither party to the
alliance should contest House of Reps, seats
held by the other, and (2) that the Nation-
alists should have one more Minister than
the Cockies. It was not the best arrange-
ment that could have been made, but the
Prime Minister, having gone into the thing
with his eyes open, cannot now dishonor
it without dishonoring himself. The Minis-
try needs strengthening in certain respects,
but the job can be done without going back
on a definite agreement and forcing the
Country party to take up a position which
would admit of Labor regaining office at no
distant date. Pearce should obviously be
dropped. Australia has done enough for this
flabby Minister, who would have lost his
seat the other day but for the circumstances
brought about by the transport strike; as it
was, he polled fewer primary votes than a
Country-party candidate whom a Leg.
Council electorate had turned down cold.
With Massy Greene available for the leader-
ship of the Senate, there is no excuse for
employing Pearce. Other Ministerial vacan-
cies may arise owing to the necessity for
appointing anew Speaker, anew President
of the Senate and another Chairman of
Committees in the House of Reps. If so,
the claims of men who have been useful to
the Government during the past three years
—such men as Latham, the Victorian,
Jackson, the Tasmanian, Hunter, the
Queenslander, and Westralian Senator
Lynch —should be preferred to those of poli-
ticians who played for safety or sulked in
their tents.
Labor’s Chance to be Democratic.
When the recent N. S. Wales State election
was held, the Labor party returned to power on
a minority vote; and when behind this it is
remembered that the system of party selec-
tion limits the choice of the electors to the
nominees of a mere handful on either side
while any expression of opinion on scores of
matters is impossible, it is easily seen what
small potatoes the elector is in the whole


scheme. Nor does the fact that matters in
other countries are on a no more satisfactory
footing make thoughtful people feel any
easier about it. Further, considering
the extreme likelihood that the Parlia-
mentary majorities Avill do as they please
for three years quite apart from platform
and election pledges, and that the losing
party organisations will be all the time trying
to play tricks with the existing mechanism
rather than improve it, the hope of re-
form under our jiresent system of gov-
ernment cannot be regarded as great.
Yet the question of the expression of
t’he direct democratic will through the Refer-
endum with Initiative, preferably coupled
with a system of Elective Ministries, has
been so often discussed without result that
it has begun to look like a merely ornamen-
tal bauble occasionally displayed for the
amusement of the people. No real argument
on democratic lines has ever been advanced
against it, except the apparently unanswer-
able one that legislators, once they have been
elected to their seats, are against it. It is
quite clear, nevertheless, that Avhatever
imperfections may be inseparable from the
machine employed for the election of repre-
sentatives the evil due to such imperfections
is largely minimised by the Referendum sys-
tem. It is even reasonable to believe that
with it and the Initiative wholly in the hands
of the people a nominee chamber in no sense
representative could be made to do better
work than our present Parliament. On the
Labor platform the Referendum and tlie
Initiative have long had a place; but of late
it has been a place right in the rear of the
movement, and the tricksters and wire-
pullers naturally desire that it should stay
there. Yet sincere Labor men placed those
proposals on the programme and meant them
to be effective. Surely the opportunity of
those earnest men has now arrived. Others
Avho believed that Labor could Avin and carry
out its best intentions through the muddle
of party and the jumble of faction have had
a long try and have largely failed. If Labor
believes in the people it should say so defin-
itely, and allow the people to rule. During
the next three years let it bring those old
planks right up to the front and make them
the centre of its propaganda; if it Avill do
that it will prove its democratic sincerity
in a way which even its bitterest opponents
cannot question. If it refuses or fails to do
iL the only possible conclusion can be that
it doesn’t trust the people and doesn’t desire
them to rule.
#
The Tote.
A. Totalisator Bill is being drafted in Vic-
toria for presentation some time next month.
Unlike previous efforts of the kind, it will
be a Government measure, but the present
Leg Assembly takes an impish delight"® in
snubbing the Allan-Peacock Government,
so that won’t help it much. Moreover, the
Assembly has changed little in personnel
since it threw out Morley’s bill by 41 votes
to 15 in August, 1922. Now, as then, it
contains powerful friends of McSiiortodds
arid the Methodist Conference, as also does
the other House; and the' indications are
that these queer allies Avill unite once more
to prevent the advent of the machine which
never nobbles, stiffens, welshes, or keeps
money wagered on non-starters, and which
always pays decent odds when the Govern-
ment to whose revenue it contributes gives
it a fair spin. In the debate on Peacock’s
Budget, ex-Treasurer McPherson said: “If
a Totalisator Bill is placed before this House
it will never be passed.” Nevertheless Vic-
toria needs the tote, and the man who first
imposed the tax on bookmakers’ tickets
should be the last to vote against the
machine on moral grounds. Also the Gov-
ernment could do Avith the revenue which a
totalisator tax would bring in. Last year
N. S. Wales derived £248,282 from this
source, £221,341 coming from 10 metropoli-
tan racecourses. Yet the totalisator is han-
dicapped in N. S. Wales by excessive deduc-
tions —the Government takes 9 p.c. and the
clubs 34 p.c., fractions of sixpences and un-
claimed dividends, or 13 1-5 p.C. altogether
—and by being restricted to a not very
attractive form of place betting. The result
is that many punters prefer the racecourse
bookmaker, who is not burdened with a
13 1-5 p.c. impost, or anything like it ; and
many more patronise the shop or street
operator, who pays no tax of any descrip-
tion—neither racecourse-admission tax nor
betting-tax nor income-tax nor license-fee.
If Victoria had straightout, place (equal-
division) and double-event totes, it would
probably get as much revenue from a 44 p.c.
Government tax as N. S. Wales is getting
from its greedy 9 p.c. The Allan-Peacock
Government’s bill should certainly make pro-
vision for such totes, and for a moderate
tax. Its chance of becoming law would be
further improved if it permitted a limited
number of licensed bookmakers to field along-
side the totes (the small fry would not long
survive the competition) and declared a war
of extermination on unlicensed bookmaking.
Such a war could be made effective by trans-
ferring the present interdict on the publica-
tion of ante-post odds, which is useless, any-
way, to the publication of nominations,
Aveights and acceptances. Non-proprietary
clubs might be permitted to issue the handi-
caps for races such as the Melbourne, Caul-
field and Australian Cups not earlier than
a week before the event, but in all other
eases “the weights” should be restricted by
law to official programmes sold only inside
the racecourse gates. Then would the
starting-price bookmaker and the professional
tipster have to give up preying on the army
of fools who lose their wages on horses
which they rarely, if ever, see. The races
would remain, and attendances would in-
crease (as also would prizes and consolidated
revenue), but innumerable tax-dodging para-
sites would be deprived of the easy money
they draw from vast multitudes of “mugs.”
It is impossible to wipe out betting in Aus-
tralia, but it is possible, and eminently desir-
able. 'to confine it to the racecourse, the
only place where it is legal. And the thing
mi°ht very Avell be aimed at, as far as Vic-
toria is concerned, in the Allan-Peacock
Government’s Totalisator. Bill.

United at Last.
With the Federal election results opening a
prospect of early success to them, Queens-
land's anti-Labor parties have dropped their
squabbles and come together. Henceforth
there will be only one Opposition party in-
side Parliament, and one party organisation
outside. In the past the anti-Labor groups
have been too busy fighting among them-
selves to spare much time for the common
enemy. They have fought under a variety
of names—Liberals, Nationalists, Progres-
sives, National Democratic Union, Country
party. The United party was formed, but it
was no more united than its predecessors.
Then, about 18 months ago, a working agree-
ment was made between the United party
and the Country party, with Arthur Moore
(of the Country party) as leader of the
w T hole Opposition. This arrangement worked
so Avell that it led to the merging of the two
parties six months ago. The Country sec-
tion, hoAvever, insisted on excluding four
members from the coalition, because they
were regarded as hostile to the producers’
interests. The excluded members formed a
little party of their own, commonly known
as “the Rump,” and retained control of part
of the outside organisation. “The Rump”
had the support of the Courier, and the
Coalition Avas backed by the Daily Mail.
Bitter controversy was waged between the
rival factions in the press and in the party
organisations, while Labor looked on and
chuckled. All that is over. There is now
only one party, to be called the Country Pro-
gressive, which will have the solid backing of
the outside organisations and the party press.
The squabbles and disputes hitherto have
not only stultified the Opposition, but by
disgusting intelligent men have made i,t dif-
ficult to get a good type of candidate. Suc-
cessful business and busy professional _ men
naturally did not rush the chance of joining
a nondescript party Avhich spent its time in
faction fights, with a prospect of another 10
years in Opposition. No\V, Avith a united
party and an excellent prospect of success
at the approaching State elections, there
ought to be no difficulty in inducing capable
men to come fonvard as candidates. The
anti-Labor Opposition has been at low ebb
for years past, but the tide is at the flood
which leads on to office.
O
The Importing Mania in Victoria.
Notavitiistanding the great things Protec-
tion has done for Victoria, many Government
departments and municipal bodies in that
State have the importing mania -in a severe
form. Almost every Aveek comes the
announcement that the Electrical Commis-
sion has sent abroad for machinery, or that
the Agricultural Department is importing
a reaper and binder, or that a foreign road-
roller is arriving to the order of some sub-
urban council, when articles as good or better
could have been purchased in Victoria. It
is one of the demoralising effects of the boom
in borroAving. Usually the excuse is the
comparative cheapness of the imported
article, but in a little matter of rail anchors
—contraptions which fasten rails to sleepers
to prevent “slipping” under the pressure of
oncoming trains —the foreigner was preferred
to the mere Australian, although his price
Avas higher. Until 1920 the Vic. Railway
Department was obliged to use American
rail anchors; and the Vaughan type, then
in use, cost 2s. 3d. apiece. In 1920 the
“Superior” type was introduced ; the Depart-
ment turned these out in its own workshops at
Is. 9d. each. Then W. J. T. McLean, foreman
blacksmith in the Spencer-street workshops,
hit upon an improvement, which he has
named the “M.B. rail anchor,” and patented
it in 17 countries. He secured a trial order
for 1000 from the Railway Department and
presently transferred his rights to a com-
pany. That the M.B. anchors have proved
effective is shoAvn by orders received from
other railway authorities on the recommen-
dation of the Victorian department. The
N.S.W. railways ordered 150,000, the Tas-
manian 4000, the Commonwealth 5000 and
the South Australian 1000; moreover, the
engineers of the Canadian Pacific, after an
exhaustive trial of samples, and those of the
M.L. railAvays, after a two-year test on
a grade of 1 in 50, have reported 100 p.c.
efficiency. Yet the Victorian Railway Com-
missioners, in dealing with tenders for rail
anchors, recently accepted the offer of an
American firm which quoted a price of
Is. 44d. each, although the M-F. Rail Anchor.
Ltd., offered to supply 75,000 at lljd. and
25,0p0 at Is. Id. In reply to protests, the
Commissioners explained that the Americans
were merely getting a “trial” order —a trial
order for 100,000 rail anchors! It is re-
called that the same department formerly
considered 1000 a sufficient trial lot for the
M. 8., and a purchase of 20 Avas regarded as
ample for experimental purposes Avhen the
“Superior” anchor was introduced. There
were other official “explanations,” but the
Australian manufacturers took the shine out
of them by offering to submit their contri-
vance to any comparative test, laboratory or
otherwise. It is now said that these manu-
facturers are themselves to get a “trial”
order for 100,000 anchors. But that, if
true, will only show that there Avas no reason,
except importing fanaticism, for passing them
over in the first place, considering that they
reduced the price of the article required from
an original 2s. 3d. to approximately Is.
♦
The Next Drought.
“B utten derby” : If there is anything in tlie
theory of the cycle of the seasons—and there
seems to be quite a lot—Australia is due for
an old-man drought in ’26 or ’27, and with
the tragic experiences of many former
droughts Ave should be in a better position
to meet it than Ave are. The casualness of
the Australian is nowhere more apparent
than in his haphazard methods of safeguard-
ing his greatest primary industry— aa;ool. In
fact, Avlien. one realises the economic waste
entailed by the loss of 10 or 20 million sheep,
most of Avhich could be saved, one Wonders
if “casual” quite meets the case. It is not
only the loss of the sheep: the diminution
of our exportable wool, and the consequent
shrinkage of income Avhile our flocks are
breeding back to normal, has to be taken
into account. Another important point, and
one that is often overlooked, is that, with
the number of ewes greatly diminished, there
is not that margin which permits of the
culling and selection so necessary to the
maintenance of a high standard, and the
-temptation to make up our losses as speedily
as possible tends to the mating of non de-
script animals. I do not say there are no
sheep-owners who make a certain amount of
provision against drought, nor do I infer
that such provision is entirely a matter for
them alone. The industry having such a
direct bearing ou the national prosperity, and
the finance that would be necessai'y to make
it reasonably secure being so considerable, it
would be neither reasonable nor practicable
to expect the handful of owners to
shoulder the entire burden. That burden,
to a certain extent, should be borne by the
nation. We pay above world parity for
our locally-grown sugar, so this industry,
which is confined to a very small area, re-
ceives a substantial bonus. But there is an
obligation on the individual, too. Some of
the precautionary measures that can be
taken were demonstrated by the late N. A.
Gatenby, of Jemalong, Forbes (N.S.W.).
I spent a few days there during our last
drought, and saw sheep being hand-fed on
irrigated lucerne at the rate of 75 to the
acre. In practically every paddock there
was a silo pit which had been filled the pre-
vious year with barley-grass and thistles cut
along the river-bank, and sheep were doing
well on the silage at the rate of a ton per
3000 per day. Hundreds of thousands of
sheep died that year in the Forbes district,
yet many of the stations possessed quite as
good facilities for irrigation and silage-making
as Jemalong. About 300,000 Burrawaug
sheep were fed at a cost of a trifle over fl
a head, while the Jemalong sheep came
through with practically no additional ex-
pense. That is one directiou in which the
sheep-man, situated in a suitable locality,
could help himself. Another example of
drought-insurance was supplied by a Cobar
squatter. I met him some years back when
lie was feeding sheep on wheat at famine
prices. Later on he bought several hundred
acres in the wheat-belt, his intention being
to let it on the share system and build a
huge silo, into which his share of the grain
would be stored against contingencies. This
appears to me to be an excellent idea, and
could be followed by many of our wealthy
squatters. Possibly a similar scheme on a
vast scale would be the best method for the
Government to adopt. So much for the
material aspect of this great question. But
there is another which we cannot ignore—
the humanitarian. On one Queensland sta-
tion, on which I was working at the time,
the losses during a period of drought Avere
estimated at 180,000 sheep, and most of
that number suffered indescribable torments.
Day after day I killed scores of them, pitiful
bundles of skin and bone that were either
too Avcak to stand up or hopelessly bogged
in a bore-drain or mudhole, and the face of
each was an eyeless, bloody mask, while
many were partially disembowelled. For
every sheep we mercifully dispatched dozens
similarly mutilated were missed, and blow-
flies were buzzling around in millions, while
overhead Avheeled countless myriads of crows
—waiting! I have ridden over miles of
country, and stretching to the horizon on
every hand were bones. A very Gol-
gotha ! On another station over 300 horses
were shot —horses that had borne the heat
and burden of the day and helped to make
dividends possible, but now there was no
grass and feed was fabulously dear. Busi-
ness? Possibly. But along the river-banks
of that station, which belonged to an enor-
mously wealthy company, were thousands of
acres of bare, parched soil which might have
been waving under lucerne. On that station,
which" is typical of so many moi-e, year after
year thousands of tons of grass, eminently
suitable for hay or silage, had been let go
to Avaste. Yes, we are a casual people ! In
some respects, I think, criminally, heartlessly
casual; and each successive drought the
stench of millions of tortured, rotting sheep,
that patient, uncomplaining animal on whose
back we have travelled so far and fast, pro-
claims the fact to high Heaven.
The Submarine.
“X.R.N.”: Tlie cry for the abolition of
submarines, which has been revived in Eng-
land by the Ml disaster, is no sign of cold
feet. Neither tlie Admiralty nor the R.N.
has ever advocated the abolition of anything
or the alteration of any proposed, course of
action merely because there was danger
attached to it. A similar outcry took place
when the early destroyers broke their backs
with depressing regularity. The defect was
ultimately remedied, and since then destroyers
have safely weathered China Sea typhoons,
notably the Exe and Dee about 1907. With
submarines, however, the case is different,
because they have no record as successful
fighting craft to justify them. The damage
done by submarines during the late
carnage by way of legitimate warfare was
negligible.' That Germany used them for
the wholesale sinking of merchant ships
is only an added argument for their total
abolition. Where submarines really were
useful was in reporting work off enemy
coasts. When we had the craft to spare
towards the middle and end of the war we
maintained regular cordons of observation-
submarines close up to the German and Dan-
ish coasts. Their business was not to attack,
but simply to report, and very valuable work
they did, though even here their limitations
were marked. When three or four Germau
battle-cruisers were reported steering north
along the coast, of Jutland, our battle-cruiser
fleet hastened to the scene, only to find that
in fact the enemy had been steering south.
The very difficult task of estimating a ves-
sel's course by periscope observation had
caused the mistake. It is doubtful if sub-
marines will be particularly useful for this
kind of work in the next war. The slender-
ness of thd German North Sea coastline and
the general shortness of North Sea distances
played splendidly into the submarine’s hands
as look-out craft. In any case, recent experi-
ments point to aircraft as obviously more
fitted for such work. The argument that the
submarine, being cheaper in quantities than
battleships and cruisers—this was Charl-
ton’s comic idea—will comprise the small
nation’s navy is entirely fallacious. The
very effective answer to tlie underwater craft
is the destroyer, and the latter serves other
very useful functions besides having the same
effect on a submarine flotilla as a ferret has
on a bunch of rabbits. Destroyers vitally
influenced the course of the Battle of Jut-
land. If the poor nation, therefore, builds
submarines, the rich one will answer with
destroyers, and as far as naval strength
is concerned tlie poor one will only be the*
poorer by the cost of the submarines. All
nations should vote to abolish the submarine,
but the R.N. is not in the least likely to do
so because a few lives have been lost, deplor-
able as that loss is.

Christianity and Bolshevism.
Dear Bulletin, Alice Jackson (B.
12/.1.1/’25) should change her quotation-
service. Marx did not advocate “the official
and open community of women.” The com-
munist manifesto says that the bourgeois
pretend that the community of women is to
be openly and officially established by the
communists. Marx and Engels are heavily
ironical at the poor bourgeois’s expense.
“Tlie bourgeois,” they write, “sees in his
wife a mere instrument of production. He
hears that the instruments of production are
to be exploited in common, and, naturally,
can come to no other conclusion than that
the lot of being common to all will likewise
fall to the women. He has not even a sus-
picion that the real point aimed at is to do
away with the status of women as mere
instruments of production.” Their argu-
ment is this: (1) Bourgeois marriage hypo-
critically conceals a real community of
women. (2) If the communists advocated
community of women (which they don’t)
the bourgeois would have no right to re-
proach them. (3) But “it is self-evident
that the abolition of the present system of
production must bring with it the abolition
of the community of women springing from
that system, i.e., of prostitution, both public
and private.” Will Alice Jackson read for
herself Trotsky’s “Problems of Life’
(Methuen, 1924) ? At page 48 he says : Un-
less there is actual equality of husband and
wife in the family, in a normal sense as well
as in the conditions of life, we cannot speak
seriously of their equality in social work,
or even in politics. As iong as woman is
chained to her housework, the care of the
family, the cooking and sewing, all her
chances of participation in social and politi-
cal life are cut down to the extreme.
Alice Jackson demurs to the parallel found
by Alan Mickle (B. 15/10/’25) between
the ideals of the early Christians and those
of the Bolsheviks. She can see no analogy.
But Mickle is right. Dill (“Roman Soci-
ety,” page 11) quotes St. Paulinus as writing
to a Roman soldier that Christianity was op-
posed to family life, to citizenship, to patriot-
ism, and that soldiers were doomed to hell-
fire. St. John Chrysostom said: “To grow
rich without injustice is impossible. But
what if one succeeded to his father’s in-
heritance? Then he receives what had been
gained by injustice.” Again, lie said: “This
idea we should have of the rich and covet-
ous—they are truly as robbers who, standing-
in the public highway, despoil the passers.”
“Nature,” wrote St. Ambrose, of Milan, “is
the mother of common right, usurpation is
the mother of private right. Property hath
no rights. The earth is the Lord’s, and we
are His offspring. The pagans hold land
as property. They do blaspheme God.”
Apologising for Nero’s tortures, Tacitus
says: “They suffered, those votaries of a
pernicious superstition, not indeed that they
were guilty of the fire, but for their hatred
of the human race” (see Cape’s “Age of the
Antonines,” page 131). Had Alice Jackson
lived in the second century, she would have
believed, as every respectable citizen believed,
that the Christian sacrament was a secret
orgy of infanticide, cannibalism and incest
(see Gibbon, chapter 16). She would cer-
tainly have persecuted in the excellent com-
pany of Marcus Aurelius. “Christianity,”
says Gilbert Murray (“Five Stages of
Greek Religion”), “had a comparative indif-
ference to the virtues of a governing class.”
“Afterwards,” says the Argus reviewer,
“when the governing class came in, they
brought, in these virtues.” That coming-in
of the governing class at the pretended con-
version of the Roman world lias been spoken
Communism in Throe phasos.

FIRST PHASE.
The morning sky was red and wild.
Disorder filled the straggling street;
The dirty laneways were defiled
Where crowds went by on laggard feet.
A sudden clamor in the square,
A sudden break of sound and flame;
The butcher regiments of despair
Along the shrieking highway came.
Yield to the revolution’s power,
Or speak a heedless word and die!
This is the people’s crowning hour —
And very still the dead men lie!
SECOND PHASE.
The morning sky was red and wild,
The time was short, the temper bad ;
In ordered ranks the public filed,
Waiting with downcast looks and sad.
By number called, the people came
For orders to the Soviet boss;
No woman there had any name,
No man could speak of gain or loss.
Go to the job that has'been set,
Go eat and drink the things prepared!
The dull routine of'give and get
By voiceless multitudes is shared.
. THIRD PHASE.
The morning sky was red and wild.
Th,e people in their prison groaned;
Only the ragged despot smiled
In joy of that high power he owned.
The sudden throbbing of a drum,
A bugle call, a distant cheer!
At last the liberators come;
Guns thunder freedom on the ear.
The ragged armies of despair
Are broken in the people’s sight;
There comes a breath of purer air,
The chains on every heart seem light.
All this has been, all this could be,
If folly hold her blood-drenched reign,
And free sons of the ancient free
Give up their freedom for a chain.

Alexandra.
The death of Queen Alexandra in her 8.1 st
year removes a figure which has been held
in the highest sentimental regard for more
than six decades. Even Queen Victoria
never called the mind back to such a carnival
of spring and young love as the “sea-king’s
daughter from over the sea.” She came in
an age of small rosebuds and mild manners.
Victoria had lifted royalty from the sombre
gloom of an old institution accepted for
want of a better into a realm of domesticity
and solid British respectability; Alexandra
walked sweetly into the picture like the prin-
cess of a splendid fairy tale. She had beauty
and grace and frankness and laughter; and
though her com monsense was a good deal
more in real evidence than the much-adver-
tised brand of the article owned by her step-
mother, it was not the quality which was
most in the public eye. She came to Eng-
land in a deep surge of gentle national emo-
tion. Her own land sent her away in' show-
ers of roses; and all the intervening sea and
land Avas gay with bunting and cheers. Great
decorated warships hovered about her on
the voyage; an earl drove the engine of her
floAver-festooned train ; young girls made for
her a carpet of flowers; the Thames glittered
Avith pageant; all London —and, indeed, all
Britain—rocked with the clamor of welcom-
ing bells and cannon; and while still new
batches of girls strewed roses and fresh
cheers took up the chorus, the Prince stepped
into the picture, held her hands and kissed
her before the multitudes. It Avas all very
like the marriage of Guinevere or the wak-
ing of the Sleeping Beauty ; and it was all
very characteristic of the time. But the
strange thing about it was that the woman’s
life, lived in the semi-publicity of British
royalty, kept that old scent of roses around
her for more than 60 years. Other women
Avere called good or Avise or strong; all her
long life Alexandra was called lovely.
That Avord summed up the other virtues;
and as she stood in old age still
young and fair among her ageing daugh-
ters, the Avorld Avas forced to wonder
at the sAveetness of Avill that made such last-
ing beauty possible. Probably Alexandra
saved the. British monarchy. No one speaks
to-day with any enthusiasm of a British re-
public ; yet the republican feeling was once
very strong. Hoav much of the sentiment
Avhich gathered about King Edavard VII.
Avas due to his wife it would be hard to esti-
mate ; but it is certain that the hardest
Avords ever said against royalty by its bit-
terest opponents* always contained a qualify-
ing clause in favor of Alexandra. When
the future world dreams of fair Avomen and
hovers in fancy between the sweet pale saints
and splendid courtesans, this Queen, with
her youth and her love and her laughter. Avill
fill the imagination for long ages. Peace to
her ashes ; she did us great kindness!

This week The Bulletin’s daughter, the
Woman’s Mirror, completes its first year
of life. That it was wanted has been proved
by the welcome it has received. When the
new paper was first sent to the stalls, a
circulation of 25,000 was provided for. The
estimate was far too modest: week by week
there has been an increased demand, until at
the end of the first year a circulation exceed-
ing 100,000 has been reached. It is highly
gratifying; and not the le*ast gratifying fea-
ture is that the circulation is becoming Avorld-
Avide, like that of The Bulletin. The
paper is doing a national service in its own
way. It is helping Australian women to live
better while living, within their means; and
in these days of high costs that is a matter
of national importance. It is helping them
to make the home more comfortable; and
that is a matter of national importance too.
It is providing them with a certain amount
of entertainment and a large amount of good
reading; to those who can write it is offer-
ing a market for their wares; it is gmng
those who are experienced in the domestic
arts and sciences and in crafts a vehicle for
informing others; it is bringing the city
Avoman in closer touch with the country
woman, and the country woman in closer
touch with her city sister. Its extraordinary
success proves not only its usefulness, but
a wide recognition of that usefulness: and
the field it has to cover is so vast —for there
is not a home in which its value does not far
exceed the Bd. a week charged for it—that it
seems fairly safe to say that its second year
will witness almost if not quite as pheno-
menal a growth as its first year; and that
has been quite without precedent in Austra-
lian newspaper history.

“Henry Horsecollar” : Wynyard-square.
Sydney, is being dragged up by the roots to
make room for a station on that city snail-
way which has got about this far after a
dozen years of effort. It recalls old times
and happenings. East century the Ma State
metropolis talked itself hoarse about the need
for anew railway station, the old Redfern
affair being out of the way, mouldy, ram-
shackle and obsolete. In those days labor,
materials and land were cheap, and sky-
scrapers hadn’t begun to block the way. So
The Bulletin ran an agitation in many
articles for bringing the whole passenger
system, and not a mere skinny extension, to
a main station in the Wynyard-square dis-
trict, and then per bridge over the harbor,
thus doing away with the awkward
dead-end altogether. Apparently it was
held, in high and pig-headed quarters, that
the time was not ripe. There was at least
one other scheme for extension into the city,
but thickheaded circles said it wasn’t ripe
either. The Owe’Sullivan, who ministered
to Public Works in 1899-1904, cut the
knot with a blunt axe. Being doubtful
which way to bring the railway into the city,
he left it practically out of the city and
built a one-or-two-million-pounds contraption
not far from the old spot. It was opened
in 1906, and influential numskulls, not to
mention blitherers, said that the wants of
Sydney were met for 50 years ahead. Less
than nine years later, when the price

of everything was sky-liigh and go-slow
had become the fashion, another N.S.W.
Government was liiriug British contractors,
at great cost, to push a thin little extension
into the heart of things. Most of the lines
were still to end at Owe’Sullivan’s master-
piece on the fringe, but the busy centre was
to be furnished with a sort of branch device.
This is the egg or dream that is ripening
now. The size of the bill will possibly be
matched by the size of the failure. It is all
of a piece with Canberra. In Unit also
politicians couldn’t agree over various fairly
good sites, so they compromised by choosing
a particularly hopeless one, and people are
tired of the Federal city before it is officially
born. The ways of borrowing, loafing,
lingering, cow-lieaded incompetents pass
understanding.

“M.G.S.”: A high court of appeal to pro-
tect the public's trees is badly needed. There
are too many barbarous notions of what
trees are for, and too many authorities with
power to carry them out. A country coun-
cil in X. S. Wales refused to join a move-
ment for planting a main road with trees
because there was no guarantee that they
would survive their many persecutors; and
the council was about right. The protest
of the mere owners at the destruction of
a fine Moreton-bay which made the Sydney
National Gallery good to look at brought
forth an explanation that the thing upset
the architectural balance of the edifice and
hid the pretentious inscriptions with which
it is labelled. The citizen’s only means of
saving his property at present is by pro-
test, usually belated, in the press. If every
tree planted in the public territory could
summon its would-be executioners and wit-
nesses for the defence before a board, a lot
of unnecessary uglification would be avoided.
C anada has made a commotion on the
Pacific Cable Board by threatening to leave
if the duplication of the route is completed.
Having only a small interest in better com-
munications with this country, she wants
to _ see her share of the £2,250,000 reserve,
built up mainly by Australian cable-users,
in her own pocket instead of in expensive
new cables. The other members of the Board,
having possibly well-founded fears that beam
wireless may cut into their business unless
their own system is enormously improved,
want to lay the speedy Permalloy cables all
the way from Canada to Australia. The
Canuck member has no objection to the
duplication of the section from Honolulu to
Maoriland, but somewhat tliick-headedly jibs
at the Bamfield (Canada) to Fiji duplica-
tion. This section is the longest electrically,
if not geographically, in the world, and
worked at a snail’s pace until Heurtley, an
ex-officer of the Extension Co., applied a
magnifier to it. Even then it only managed a
speed of 24 words a minute. To lay at
enormous cost a section working at 600 words
a minute (the speed of the Permalloy cable)
to feed a section working' at 24, would be
like putting Windbag into the shafts of a
wool lorry.

Peter Stuckey Mitchell, deceased, under
his will constituted a trust to which lie
devised the residue of his estate for a novel
and beneficent purpose, lie desired to, en-
courage and help the capable, healthy and
strong ‘‘to develop and bring to fruition
their natural advantages.” The benefits were
limited to no class. “Wliat is this?” asked
the Federal Commissioner of Taxation when
he set about making his exactions under the
Estate Duty Assessment Act, a piece of
oppressive legislation which. however,
exempts from death duties bequests to
religious, scientific, charitable, or public
educational purposes. Thinking it over in
the light of doing his best for the Common-
wealth Treasury he came to the conclusion
that this was none of these things and pro-
ceeded to tax the trust funds. The trustees
objected. “Oh. no,” they said, “this is a
charity and you can’t demand any duties!”
The matter went to the High Court, con-
stituted of five Judges, and there the question
of whether the trust came within the mean-
ing of a “charitable purpose” was argued.
Three of their Honors held that it did not.
What “charitable purpose” meant, in their
opinion, was a relief of wants occasioned by
lack of pecuniary means and covering the relief
of any form of necessity or helplessness, in-
cluding spiritual destitution or need, which
excited the compassion or sympathy of men.
and appealed to their benevolence for relief.
Could the Mitchell Trust be brought within
this meaning? Obviously it could not; cook's
son, duke's son or the son of a millionaire
could all toe the line. Two of their Honors,
including the Chief Justice, dissented from this
limited view of a “charitable purpose” within
the meaning of the Act. The trustees,
greatly daring—though, indeed, the cost
would come out of the estate —-carried the
matter to the Privy Council, which, like
death, has the distinction of being a final
court of appeal. Their Lordships of the
Judicial Committee have now held with the
two dissenting Judges and. allowed the
appeal. So now, apparently, you may leave
your money to any kind of scheme calcu-
lated to benefit your fellow man, and con-
stitute it a “charitable purpose.”

Tbefex : “Xamilc’s par. re Queensland
wool (B. 29/10/’25) cannot go unchallenged;
it is too misleading. Up - to about five years
ago the average Queensland wool was of
70’s quality, but is now coarser owing to
the use of broad-haired, bold-stapled, dense-
wooled N. S. Wales and S.A. rams, introduced
to counteract the natural tendency towards
fineness and thinness, which means loss of
weight in the fleece. This tendency is not
solely due to climatic conditions; the chemi-
cal composition of the soil, and, therefore,
of the natural grasses and herbage, also
affects it very largely. Nor are these experi-
ences peculiar to Queensland; they are
everywhere in evidence. As to the effect of
feed, one has only to observe the wool from
identically-bred sheep in identical climates,
but one portion running on saltbush and one
portion otherwise. The saltbush-raised wool
is never so fine. “Xamilc’s” statement
that Australia’s best fine wool comes from
certain of the colder tableland districts is
right, up to a point. These wools are more
valuable in the grease, because of their condi-
tion and clean-scoured yield, but they do
not make a finer yarn than the far western
(N.S.W.) tvools. The record spin ever made
in Bradford was 50 miles of yarn from lib.
of the combed top. This wool came from
Yancannia, right away back of the Darling.
Of course, the seasons affect the quality of
wool, drought times tending to produce a
fine wool, plentiful seasons a coarser one.
There is nothing definite about these mat
ters, but I think the finest wool in Australia
would come from the belly of a moderately
bred sheep running in the West Darling dis-
tricts in times of sparse feed. One has only
to observe the attention given to these red
Western wools by the French woolbuyers
to realise the attraction of their. quality.
There are no greater users of fine wool. than
the French, and none more fussy over their
purchases.
The recent decision of the British Horn 1 '
Secretary to replace the repulsive broad-
arrow prison uniform with “decent, respect-
able clothing” might well be followed in the
Australian States. Nothing could be more
damaging to the self-respect of a prisoner
than the hideous garb he has to wear. The
sloppy, baggy trousers, shapeless coat and
rag moccasins, all of a depressing grey, and
set off by a cloth arrangement which is called
a hat, are enough to make any man feel that
he has plumbed the depths of degradation.
Probably this is what he was intended to
feel in the days when the uniform was
planned and prison discipline was regarded
as a purely repressive thing. The tonic
effect of clothes is well understood by psy-
chologists, and were the present garb to be
replaced by something decently fitting and
less repulsively distinctive, there is little
doubt that it would have its effect on the
minds of the unfortunate wearers.
The League of Nations has been taking
stock of the restrictions wlii ch various
European countries impose upon the stranger
within their gates. The inquiry serves .to
show how easy-going we are where the
foreigner is concerned. Nobody but a native
is allowed to be a hawker in Czecho-Slovakia
or Hungary; the latter country also requires
all bookmakers to be home-grown, and de-
clines to allow- any foreigner to take part in
the promotion of movie enterprises. Fin-
land insists that all printers, hotelkeepers
stud restaurant-keepers must be true Finns.
Eoumania, w-hicli has no coast-line worth
speaking about, reserves all maritime in-
surance business for its own citizens. Many
countries refuse to allow foreigners to be
concerned in the management of banks and
industrial enterprises; and the embargo is
sometimes extended to the learned professors.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The two hottest fights put up in the general
election were both won by young men, who
had no past political sins to handicap them
—Parsons in South Aus. and Nott in
Queensland. Both of them fought against
great odds and won ; Parsons had the well-
advertised sitting member to displace; Nott
had the ex-Premier of Queensland, the very
forceful Tliebdore, as an opponent in a
district which had always returned a Labor
man, though F. H. Bamford called himself
National Labor after 1916. Their success—-
and Bruce’s success, too, not to mention Ley's
ought to suggest something to the men in
charge of the Nationalist machine in every
State, and especially in Queensland. The
resurrected “old hand” has been far too
frequent a Nationalist candidate.
Joel Moses Gabb has been defeated in
Angas (S.A.), but he polled a great personal
vote. When he was only 279 behind Parsons,
his Nationalist conqueror, the Nat.-Cocky
Senate total in Angas was 7260 ahead of the
Labor total. Evidently thousands of Murray
River farmers supported Gabb for the House
of Reps, and Wilson for the Senate, the
latter in recognition of his share in negotiat-
ing the British tariff concessions. Wilson
likewise scored so well in Grey that the
Labor candidates for the Senate led the
Nat.-Cockies by a mere 103 votes when Lacey,
Labor M.H.R. for that district, was 1770
ahead. The voting in Fremantle also shows
that the personal factor is still important,
even in these days of machine politics. There
Bill Watson —an indifferent politician but a
fine old boy—scored a 5600 majority, though
the seat used to be easy for Labor and its re-
capture was reckoned a certainty.
The new Parliament is, by present arrange-
ments, to meet at Canberra some time during
1926; but a great uncertainty still prevails
as to the number of civil servants who
will stay there all the year round,
and the number who will shift back to their
old city (Offices when the Houses are not
sitting. The Commonwealth Bank is to
advance cheap money to officials who want
to put up shacks for themselves, leasehold
land not being a security which private insti-
tutions care for; but building is dear and
slow, and a six-roomed brick abode costs
£2OOO or so. It has therefore come to be
recognised that service at the metropolis
must be paid for at overtime rates. So the
first expense of setting up Canberra isn’t
likely to be the last, the outstanding trouble
being that no one has developed a scheme
for providing the place with any future over
and above politics and red tape.

than half the N.S.W. Premier’s charges
sound hollow: there is no honest ring about
them. Of course one wouldn’t expect him
to follow the example of anybody on the
opposite side, especially if he wore spats;
but Lang’s party might at least suggest to
him that he would be a better leader if he
tried to be more like his predecessors,
McGowen, Storey and even the displaced
Dooley.
The N.S.W. Leg. Council summarily rejected
the remarkable piece of Labor legislation
which sought to degrade railwaymen who
remained at work during the 1917 strike and
exalt those who left the job. Lang, the
accidental and soreheaded Premier, remarked
that he would ruot go to the country. A day
or two later he discovered that his Govern-
ment has “just as definite a mandate, as far
as N.S.W. is concerned, as the Federal Gov-
ernment has in regard to Commonwealth
politics.” As a matter of fact, Lang’s
crowd was 17,450 votes to the bad in the
constituencies, but managed to get 46 mem-
bers in a House of 90. Bruce and Page
were, at latest, 268,500 votes to the good,
and will have 52 members in a House of 75.
Vic. Assembly is to be asked by the Allan-
Peacock Ministry to authorise the appoint-
ment of a commission of three to redistribute
Assembly seats. The measure will stipulate
that the present number of single-seated elec-
torates (65) shall be adhered to, but that
23 or 24 shall be given to the metropolis,
instead of the present 21. The metropolitan
area will be enlarged by taking in slices of
Bulla, Evelyn and Dandenong. There has
THE RECONSTRUCTION.
“Vie. Premier Allan announces that the conference of parties on the question of redistribution of
seats has agreed that the strength of the Assembly shall remain at 65 members, and that the present
representation of 21 metropolitan seats and 44 country electorates shall be amended to 24 metropolitan
and 41 country electorates.”
FARMER ALLAN: “You certainly are a bit bare-like upstairs, Mum. How about snip-
piny a bit off the ’em to go around the neck?”
been no adjustment of boundaries since 1903,
when Irvine (now C.J.), whose hand was
guided by Kyabramapootra, did the mapping.
Ex-Treasurer McPherson’s speech on the
Victorian Budget was disappointing. The
Age had led the public to believe that he was
going to hurl a bomb which would displace
the Composite Cabinet and establish himself
as Premier, but it proved a dud. There was
derisive laughter when he said that he
wouldn’t help to put Labor in power, but
that rather than vote for an increased income-
tax he would walk out of the House. Mc-
Pherson was more canny than H. B. Higgins
was when, encouraged by the same Collins-
street journal, the present High Court Judge
submitted a no-confidence motion against the
McLean Government nearly 26 years ago.
Then it was the Opposition, led by George
Turner, which talked of walking out if
Higgins went on. The motion was with-
drawn.
There was joy among 80,000 State em-
ployees When the Vic. Parliament put the
finishing touches on the Superannuation Bill.
The maximum pension obtainable under the
scheme is £6 a week; the minimum is £l.
The group known as twilighters (those who
joined the service in the period between the
abolition of pensions and the enforcement of
insurance) are also provided for, with a
maximum of £6 and a minimum of £2 a
week. T. E. Meek, Secretary of the
Treasury, will probably be chairman of the
Board of Control. A. M. Laughton will
represent the professional division, and the
railway and public services will elect two
other members.
Queensland Labor bosses don’t worry about
a trifle like disfranchising a constituency
when the seat may be wanted by a friend.
The two ex-Premiers Theodore and Gillies
retired from the State Parliament over a
month ago, but no move was made towards
filling the vacancies till after the Federal
election. It was thought that Theodore
might want his old seat back; he says he
doesn’t, so the by-election can now go on.
Polling-day has been put off to January 16,
no doubt to give other defeated Federal
candidates plenty of time to consider whether
they will turn their attention to State poli-
tics.
The N.S.W. Labor Government has pre-
pared a bill to provide for payment of £1
per week to widows and 10s. for each child
within the age limit. Certainly widows have
lost something; but many a spinster has lost
more—the widow has had something the
spinster has never had. And often it is infi-
nitely to her credit that she hasn’t had it —
there are thousands of unmarried women
who have grown old attending to the needs
of aged parents. It may be quite a fair
thing to provide something out of State
funds for fatherless children; but why the
widow should get what is denied the spin-
ster passes understanding.
From the N.S.W. Gallery:—
Unhappy is the twister who twists too soon. Ka.v,
the Domain spouter, having been elected as an
Independent by Nationalists who thought that he
should have been given a party nomination, hastily-
concluded that a gale of Laborism was springing up,
and trimmed his sails accordingly. He not only
voted for State Labor measures—one of which, the
salary-grab, he was pledged to oppose—but bespoke
support for the Federal Labor Party on the ground
of its “opposition to communism.” Kay’s thoughts
are now gloomy when he turns to the Federal
election figures, which show, among other dishearten-
ing things, that in electorates corresponding to his
own North Shore one Nationalist polled over 4 to 1
and another nearly 3 to 1. With a sinking heart he
recognises that the Federal rout has weakened the
position of the State Labor Government, already
endangered by the inept leadership, particularly in
the Legislative Council, where its A. C. Willis is
an awkward novice among shrewd old politicians and
men of the world. He has the melancholy feeling
that the Government may be unable to control its
slender majority, and that a general election may
follow, which would mean the political annihilation
of the Independent member for North Shore. It is
a painful position altogether.
“Sol M.” : Whenever and wherever Nation-
alism is in power again, it should make it
a point to dish Communist Labor by putting
the referendum and the recall on the statute
book. The initiative is of less importance.
The referendum should be a decisive one,
and not capable of being over-ridden by Par-
liament, as was Queensland’s popular vote
against the abolition of the Upper House.
The recall, which is not so common an
animal as the referendum, would authorise
a certain proportion of the electors of any
electorate to declare their member unseated,
and to demand a fresh deal. The first man
to be thus unseated would naturally be A.
I). Kay, of the North Shore distfict of
Sydney, but it w’ould be useful in any case
where a politician was elected as white or
light brown, and turned pitch black when
in, either voluntarily or by order of some
conference, leagfic or other meddling in-
stitution.
The election that has, to all appearances,
settled the hash of Liberalism in Maoriland
has, ironically enough, returned to Parlia-
ment the last notable link with the glories
of the Liberal past—Joseph Ward, under
whose leadership the Liberals met defeat hr
1911. He went out in 1919, being defeated
for Awarua after holding the seat for 32
years, and was unsuccessful in an attempt
on Tauranga at a by-election in 1923. He
has now won Invercargill. Ward’s mistake
in 1911 w-as in imagining that the inark-
time policy of the Liberals, inaugurated by
Seddon some years before his death, was en-
dangering the party’s hold: he went to the
hustings with an ambitious policy of inno-
vations that a prosperous and contented
country simply did not want. After a defeat
on a no-confidence motion in 1912 and a
sojourn in Opposition, he w T ent back to the
Ministry of Finance in the war-time coali-
tion, and wound up the war with 17 millions
of accumulated surpluses. His speeches have
always been hard to follow-, being made up
of parentheses within parentheses; hut in
dealing with the pawnshop he has always
proved himself remarkably astute.
The Vic. Government’s latest joke is a
lucubration of about 50 pages, elaborately
bound, of winch 150 copies are issued “for
the information of members.” It is a report
of the proceedings and conclusions of a cer-
tain Sub-Committee on Economy, the main
conclusion being that no economy is possible.
“Feng-Shui”: As a young democrat —he
has been practising for only 13 years—the
Chinaman has made great progress. Before a
recent provincial election the enfranchised
citizens—about one in 10,000 of the popu-
lation—lield a conference at which the price
of their support w-as fixed. This prevented
unseemly bargaining. The successful can-
didate has his own means of recouping him-
self with interest. The last presidential
election is stated to have cost Tuan Chi-jui
5.000.000 dollars. The advance-guard of the
Trades Hall makes a great mistake in taking
only Russia for its teacher.
J. 0. Fairfax, chairman of the Australian
section of the Empire Press Union, fare-
welled Westralia with the warmth which its
size and the aggressiveness of its politicians
usually command :
If travellers could come through from Adelaide to
Perth without so many irritating changes many more
would make the journey, which would lead to greater
sympathy and understanding. Then there would be
less reason for the complaint, which was not w'ithout
justification, that Westralia did not receive all the
consideration and attention she deserved from the
rest of the Commonwealth.
There certainly are three changes between
Adelaide and Perth. One, however, is due
to the failure of Westralia to standardise the
Kalgoorlie-Pertli section; and that is the
only break which is due to breach of faith.
So in this matter, at any rate, the Common-
wealth has far more reason to complain
of ill-treatment by Westralia than West-
ralia has to complain of the Commonwealth.

THE TRANQUILLIZER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Miss Preston Stanley, in a light, flowered frock,
tripped into the Chamber, and immediately there
was a lull in the bickering. Her presence seemed
to calm the frayed tempers on both sides of the
House.”
The air was full of threatenings and slaughters,
The glass seemed set for verbal brawl and broil;
Her entrance wrought upon the troubled waters
The same salubrious effect as oil.
Tripping she came to curb the tongues unruly,
To calm disorderlies who took no stock
In the appeals or threats of Speaker Dooley,
Miss Preston Stanley in a flowered frock.
Rough males their gibes and insults ceased to volley,
A calmer atmosphere one seemed to sense
As in she swished —what Wells’s Mr. Polly
Described as a “mellifluous influence.”
Gentry who specialise in crude invective
Choked down the words that shell-like ears might
shock.
The House was out of hand. Came the corrective,
Miss Preston Stanley in a flowered frock.
Ah! Had there been some legislative Phyllis
In days wherewith our fathers were acquaint,
She might have shamed Haypes, Norton, Crick and
Willis
Into some sort of decorous restraint,
Something approaching laudable endeavor
In courtlier phraseology to knock
Each other out. Still, better late than never,
Miss Preston Stanley in your flowered frock 1
O angel sex, with hands so soft and smoothing
(Vide Sir Walter) for the pain-wrung brow,
Even the patter of your feet is soothing
Syrup to stop a scrap or quell a row !
Is this a dream? I see our Parliamentary
Brigade as quiet as any parson’s flock,
And over its behavior sitting sentry
Beneath the Speaker’s wig and passementerie,
Miss Preston Stanley in a flowered frock.

Even the taste in beer has changed since the
Great War. Ordinary beer no longer is the
staple diet; public taste has largely swerved
to lager and bitter beer, and the change has
cost scores of thousands in plant besides
tying up big money in stock—these new
beers take longer to mature. Other factors
obtrude to make the modern beer-foundry a
matter of big capital and threepenny pints
a memory. Look, for instance, at the first
item of that last comparison. These days,
with competition keen as a razor, the pur-
chase outright of freeholds is practically the
only way to guarantee security of tenure
and of market; hence pub properties have
boomed. There is, however, compensation
in the fact that some city freeholds are worth
far more than their value as pub sites, and
that is something pleasant for shareholders
to consider when, in dark moments, their
thoughts turn to the possibilities of Prohibi-
tion. That increase in pub prices also ex-
plains much of the increase shown by
brewery cos. in the volume of their advances
(part of the book-debts item). Tooth’s
“sundry debtors” rose last year from
£869,296 to £1,172,258. The effects of nor-
mal expansion are visible in that as in all
other items; but, apart from that, the River-
ina purchases called for financing of houses,
and a 50 p.c. advance nowadays may repre-
sent three times more than it did in, say,
1914. Stocks increased because of the fac-
tors mentioned, plus the higher prices which
ruled for grain, plus (for a certainty) the
management’s foresight in anticipating the
increase in excise on spirits and its purchase
of big supplies.
Tooth’s is well established in N. S. Wales,
and its purchases in recent years of Castle-
maine and Woods (Newcastle), of Mahon
(Wagga) and Lincoln (Narrandera) have
given it control of areas that ought to yield
good harvests. The 10 p.c. on the greater
capital has proved a simple proposition, and
it should be even easier as time goes on and
increased turnover reduces the percentage of
overhead. And the fact that visible reserves
are over £435,000 is comforting to those who
wake in the silent watches of the night think-
ing of Pussyfoot Johnson and his friends.

Increased business, quicker turnover, success
of wireless broadcasting—these were factors
that contributed to the much-increased profit.
Throughout the period competition in the
retail softgoods business in Sydney was
keener, and overseas values, under the in-
fluence of speeded-up production in low-wage
Continental countries, fell point by point.
Blit Farmer’s handled both problems with
success. Lower values influenced balance-
sheet figures: stocks represented £365,775 on
July 31; a year earlier £467,002. The money
released was placed in Commonwealth stock
and bank drafts. The cash holding, how-
ever, shrank by £24,257. Here are compari-
sons :

An amount of £33,484 owing on mortgage
on the George-street property was paid dur-
ing the year, but the other creditor item
went from £96,308 to £162,628. The co.’s
new building—or, rather, one section, the
George and Market streets corner—is now
being erected. When it is completed there
still will be the task of remodelling the rest
of the big pile to complete the plan. The
directors expect then to carry additional
stock, and open up some new business.
Farmer’s has moved solidly from the days
of the old arcade front in Pitt-street, and
a glance at the introductory table will show
how well the craft has been steered.. In the
big slump following 1920, when most trad-
ers in the Commonwealth were hit heavily
by the crash in prices, Farmer’s continued
without visibly faltering. It must have had
a nice bit put by then to meet such troubles,
and it. is quite likely that the balance-sheet
to-day does not reveal the real strength
either. For instance, there seems to be a
hidden reserve in the premises item, despite
the fact that it bulks in the books at £627,471
—£soo less than the previous year, by the
way. But internal strength is necessary,
because visible reserves of £160,239 are not
over-substantial compared with paid capital
of almost a million. Further, two-thirds of
the capital is pref.—£2oo,ooo of 6 p.c. first
prefs. and £400,000 of 7 p.c. second prefs.—
so the capital-backing of ordinaries is small.
But after providing for liabilities, including
the final div., there were tangible assets
equal to £1 18s. Bd. for each pref. share.
And there was. in addition, whatever was
hidden in the book value of freehold and
stock. First prefs are in a very strong posi-
tion, and seconds well secured. The man-
agement of Farmer’s seems to keener
ivith the years, so ords. have every prospect
of receiving 10 p.c. until they get something
better.

With other retailers making profits almost
as great, as at the peak of the post-war
boom, this well-placed co. again shows a poor
result. Three or more things seem to be
responsible. (1) Over-optimism as to the
value of stocks. In the 1923 report the
directors said that stocks had been further
written down sufficient to ensure a sound
basis for trading. Yet the net return for
the following year was disappointingly small.
In the 1924 report the directors felt “that
the prospects for the future are very en-
couraging,” but again the accounts are not
gilt-edged ; though the profit of £14,460 was
better than the previous term’s (equal to
£Bl5l p.a.), it is still far short of the
£2(3,129 shown by the prospectus to have been
the average annual profits for the preceding
decade. (2) There is a heavy debt; mort-
gages on freeholds, sundry creditors and
overdraft run to £170,481, and that is prob-
ably costing £lO,OOO a year, or not much
short of it. Expenses have, therefore, been
naturally heavy, absorbing £105,464 of last
year’s gross profits of £179,844. For 1924
(17 months) the figures were £207,031 and
£218,498, and for 1923 £151,530 and £105,051
respectively. (3) Reorganisation of depart-
ments and structural alterations and addi-
tions have been in progress—“business was
to some extent interfered with,” says the
report. Whether the position has yet been
righted isn’t visible; but the directors now
report definitely that “stocks have been
valued on a conservative basis,” and express
the opinion that “prospects for the future
appear to be very good.”
The balance-sheet position has moved like

The grouping of all liabilities obscures the
position. What mortgage is the property
carrying? To what extent is the co. leaning
on its bankers? What are the trading debts?
Still, no matter how the heap may be com-
posed, the prof, capital is secure enough,
and the public’s interest is confined to the
9 p.c.’s. There are net tangibles with a
hook value of £279,027. equal to £2 15s 9d.
for every pref. share. Further, the finding of
the prefs.’ £9OOO a year should be a simple
matter. The continued absence of a dividend
on the other shares is regrettable; but so
long as the Hordern family are content to go
without a dividend, preferring to build up
the co.’s strength, the prefs. have certainly
nothing to grumble about.

This is the society’s jubilee year, and the
directors celebrate it by a special appeal for
deposits. And people with a few pounds to
put by might do a lot worse than listen.
They would certainly do far better for them-
selves as depositors than as purchasers of
the time-payment lots which “go-getters” are
unloading on them by the hundred. How-
ever, the difficulty of obtaining deposits of
recent years has had its compensation in
that cos. have been compelled to go slowly
and carefully. The County of Bourke has,
nevertheless, had no difficulty in raking up
enough profits to pay consistent 10 p.c. divs.,
being helped thereto, of course, by the sub-
stantial reserves. Still, there is no great
amount to spare, and though nine years ago
£25,000 was transferred to capital the dose
couldn’t be repeated to-day and the div. rate
maintained. Other movements are shown
hereunder:—

Deposits have shrunk so much that the few
which remain are extraordinarily well pro-
tected. The shrinkage must affect profits;
nevertheless, shareholders are assured of the
10 p.c. so long as total funds earn 74 p.c.
net. It is done; but it takes careful "man-
agement and strict economy to do it.

Practically the same amount was distributed
to shareholders as in the previous yeai-, but
owing to the 1924 capitalisation the div. rate
was reduced. There was even then little
to spare; but there seldom has been—the
only conspicuous exception was when the
sale of the co.’s central office gave one year’s
cake a ricli icing. Deposits, a shade less,
were only £18,578; nevertheless the manage-
ment had not gone to its bankers —the lia-
bility there was reduced from £5Oll to
£1495. Mortgages were £3763 less—
£lB6,3l(l. With no properties on its hands
there was no profit from sales. There are
nowadays so few new advances on the books
lit any one time that the risk of large losses
from a sudden slump is small, notwithstand-
ing the high level of property values. On
the other hand deposits are so difficult to
attract that the brake is down hard on pro-
fits, and, though the present dividend may
be maintained, there isn’t much prospect of
anything a great deal larger in the near
future.

Deposit-money being scarce and dear, the

Depositors and other creditors were well
protected; and, assuming that no unexpected
catastrophe strikes us, the Board is doubtless
right in believing that the 9 p.c. div. can be
paid regularly. At any rate, the reserves
are a substantial help, and the average
annual profit for the past five years has
been 50 p.c. more than the 9 p.c. div. has
just called for.

They could have paid 8 p.c., but were wise
not to. Reserves are small—too small con-
sidering the uncomfortable contingencies
which coal-mining carries. Moreover, the
balance-sheet does rot indicate that anything
has been hidden away. There have been
suspicions, but nothing to suggest that they
were well-based. Consider the introductory
table—moderate to poor divs. and one lone,
microscopic bonus issue in 1914. Balance-
sheet figures compare thus :

This year less information is given as to
assets; mining and house properties, plant,
rolling stock, shares in other cos. and invest-
ments being lumped together. The 1924 sheet
gave the investments at £3570 (Common-
wealth loans) ; the “shares in other cos.”
is chiefly scrip received by the co. when it
sold the East Greta railway in 1918 to the
South Maitland Railways, Ltd.
It is hard to find another stock from which
the market has so persistently expected
better things without getting them. Given
markets to absorb the output, however, the
near future should contain better than ever
came out of the past. Stanford Merthyr and
East Greta are, it is true, old collieries whose
end is in sight; but Merthyr No. 2, near
Cessnoek, is on a 12ft. seam of best-quality
coal, and the association of Adelaide Steam
(it took up 235,000 shares at par) insures
a market for portion at least of the output.
Thus far the new pit has not acquitted itself
too well, but as it is developed a different
tale should be told. During the year
the screens, picking belts and small-
coal box were brought into use. When suf-
ficient working places have been opened up
to admit of full production the pit should
turn out 2000 tons a day. If the co. doesn’t

Nominal capital is to be increased to
£1,000,000 and 100,000 shares are to be
offered to present holders m the proportion
of one to five of their present holdings. Th

Amalgamated Zinc, which worked the De
Bavay process at Broken Hill while there
was anything available for it -the cos. now
handle their own “tailings —is little dis-
posed to go to its own funeral. It Has a
surplus of liquid assets amounting o
£227,169 apart from half a million s worth ot
other holdings, chiefly Electrolytic Zinc
shares (300,000 ordinaries). It did hope
that it would find an outlet for some ot
this in Mussen’s Tasmanian paper : makmg
scheme; but matters in connection with that
ate proceeding behind closed doors. So tar,
of course, the negotiations with the r ederal
Government for a stiff duty or other help
have failed; but the last hasn t been heard
of it by any means. The co. has a fair in-
come from investments; so it paid a shilling
div. during the half-year to June 30 and
another since; each called for £-0,000. 1 lie
liquid assets are nearly all deposits, ihe old
Broken Hill plant has sold. #
Mt. Lyell did well last year despite the
further slump in copper. For the 12 months
to September 30, the average for electrolytic
was £67 6s. as compared with £67 16s. 61.
for the preceding year, and to make the co..s
job harder wages were again lifted, the basic
being now 795. per week, an advance ot
3s. 6d. The increases are estimated as
equivalent to £1 per ton of copper. Set
that task the co. further improved treatment
methods and reduced costs. Expenditure
necessary to enable the economies and im-
provements to be effected cost £-7,06-. lwo
divs. aggregating 10 p.c. (the same as LJ-4
and 1923) were paid, and there is to be a
distribution of Is. plus 3d. bonus on Decem-
ber 15, an indication that the Board is satis-
fied with the co.’s position and its capacity
to earn profits. Factors which assist _to
brighten the picture are the co.’s other activi-
ties : the manufacture of superphosphates,
and its investments. In fact these “others
are now the chief activities. The chemical
works at Yarraville and Fremantle, for in-
stance, are in the books at £485,239, shares
in other cos. (chiefly Metal Manufactures, of
Port Ivembla, N.S.W.) £168,905, with public
securities, deposits and cash running into
nearly £300,000. It is probably correct to
say that superphosphates have been erneny
responsible for divs. paid since the resump-
tion in 1923. As that phase of Lyell’s busi-
ness is w r ell based and expanding, and as
other industries are being developed
caustic-soda and chlorine) the outlook is
quite promising. An addition of L30,b8-
tons of ore to reserves left them greater at
the end of the year, only half that quantity
having been extracted during the 12 months.
Liquid assets at September 30, apart from
shares in other cos. (which are good profit-
earners), were £950,361 in excess of lia-
bilities.

South Comet, Dundas (Tas.), struck
trouble in the matter of power, as the Gov-
ernment couldn’t supply current as early
as had been anticipated. However, a Diesel
oil-engine (to cost £1300) is being installed,
so the first section of the mill may make
a start in February. T. H. Palmer (he was
formerly g.-m. of the B. H. Junction Nortn)
told the first half-yearly meeting in Mel-
bourne that the idea is to produce zinc con-
centrates, lead concentrates and middlings.
The complete mill, including flotation plant,
won’t he ready until June next, but it is
intended to begin with the gravitation mill,
and revenue from production should help _ in
financing the cost of the full plant. With
the Diesel he thinks he can handle 200 tons
a week to start with, working up to 300 by
June. Complete recoveries can’t be got, but
the residues can be handled later. Cost of
treatment of crude ore is estimated at “not
more than 10s. a ton.”

Zeelian (Tas.) shows signs of resurrection.
W. 11. Cundy, of Bendigo, has been in the
district for several months examining, report-
ing and securing options over silver-lead
mines and shows for a Victorian syndicate.
He has confined his attention to an area a
few miles from Zeehan to the north-west.
Among other mines Cundy lias taken an
option over Brown and Clarke’s Big Ben,
which has given good returns. Some old
mines at Dundas have been re-opened and a
revival of mining generally in the Zeehan-
Dundas region is quite probable, thanks to
the better prices for metals.

“O.B.” (W.A.) : As funds are scarce and
debt is growing, Mararoa shareholders had
better prepare for more calls. Meanwhile, to
make things look as cheerful as possible, the
management reports that the mine will pay
in future. Local shareholders hope so, but
some think that the opinion of an outside
man of standing should be sought.
Empire Extended Co., which has little
cash but an abundance of forfeited scrip
ready for unloading, is looking for a new
show in the West. It was offered a reported
“up to an oz.” find at Mundiwindi on the
telegraph line between Meekatharra and
Marble Bar the other day, but the terms
were too stiff, and the locality too distant.

Boulder No. 1 Co.’s old surrendered Boulder
lease continues to increase in value. In the
last year or two a local syndicate of miners
has obtained several small but good crusli-
ings broken over a fairly big width. They
have now exposed a payable shoot for a
length of about 100 ft. at 350 ft., and generally
prospects are encouraging enough to make
the Boulder No. 1 Co. want to kick itself.
*■*■*•*
London controllers of North White Feather
(W.A.) are trying hard to revive a paralysed
market. Statements that the mine is being
watched with special interest and that there
are possibilities of a future recently appeared
in print, and a cheerful line from a Govern-
ment official’s report has been broadcasted.
A Bulletin man who saw the show some
time ago said prospects did not warrant a
continuance of operations, and nothing has
since happened to change that opinion.
* * * *
Ives Reward (W.A.) has crashed. Tiie
Bulletin always thought values were too
erratic to pay. Unfortunately the directors
believed otherwise and raked in many calls
on the strength of a promise that the “co.
would shortly crush its way to prosperity.”
The manager has been told to cease work
underground, put all available ore through
the mill and then go to Adelaide to confer
with the directors regarding future policy.
* * * *
W. F. Lee, who went from Broken Hill to
report on the N.T. Mica and Metals property
at Macdonnell Ranges, was enthusiastic on
inspection, and wired Sydney recommending
immediate exercise of the option. He de-
scribes the mica section of the show as a
“tremendous deposit sufficiently accessible to
last for years.” A sample book exhibited in
Sydney looks the goods, and confirmation of
quantity appeared to be the only outstanding
obstacle. There are 160.000 4s. shares, of
which 65,000 are vendors’, and 95,000
contributing paid to Is. Everything of
course will depend on the rate of produc-
tion. If a staff with sufficient hustle to tear
out a ton a week at a cost of £250 can be
secured, and the product marketed at any-
thing like 30s. per lb. in Adelaide, the pros-
pectus will be fully corroborated and the
return obviously somewhere about 20s. a
share per annum. Such figures look too good
to be true, but they would still be good after
heavy subtraction. The full text of Lee’s
report should clarify the position.

The first annual meeting of Mount Isa
Prop, will be merely a preliminary to the
extraordinary meeting which will place the
co. into voluntary liquidation and authorise
the distribution among shareholders of the
Mount Isa shares which form the purchase
consideration. The published accounts in
any case were of little value, representing
the position as at the close of last year.
Sardine Tin Mines. Kangaroo Hills
(N.Q.), has declared a threepenny div. pay-
able on Dec. 4. With tin at over £2BO there
should be more to follow.
* * * *
Finney’s Hill United, Brisbane, is in
financial trouble. Concentrates haven’t been
up to the expected grade and sales show a
loss lately. So there are no funds to devote
to the much-needed search for better ore. The
market not being favorably disposed, the
Minister for Mines has been approached for
help and will act on Geologist L. C. Ball’s
report. It may be inferred from his past
reports that Ball will probably recommend
some aid for a definite policy of exploration.
He thinks there has been too much hap-
hazard prospecting in the past, and, although
he admits there is not a great deal of evi-
dence to guide the search, there are signs of
Assuring and brecciation of the schists and
felsites in several areas not yet touched.
Those should be attacked, for even if the
values have been largely leached out, they
will form something definite to follow deeper,
where enrichment and primary ore may rea-
sonably be given a chance to exist. Finneys
Hill has never been an easy deposit to diag-
nose. It was a good show for a small party
while they were on. pockets of rich lead car-
bonate. It will be strange if there are not
some good ore bodies below water level, but
there is no definite lode channel to follow.
It’s a show that wants to be under the ex-
pert’s guidance all the time.

“W.” The circular of the Lander Oil Co.
(Q.) has been taken by the public as com-
plete confirmation of the sinister interest of
outside oil interests to prevent the discovery
of commercial oil in the Roma district. How-
ever, the oil-drillers’ iise of explosives and
an under-feamer in drill-holes is quite legi-
timate in certain technical contingencies.
The publication of the full text of the last
report of the individual concerned might be
interesting. One inference certain to be
drawn from the circular is that something
very good must be waiting to be tapped at
Orallo. The facts available, however, are
not nearly so clear as the inference.
* * * *
The striking of the rich shoot now being
worked in the Great Northern at Herberton
(N.Q.) justifies the urgings by the Wild
Cat” over the past 18 months for a more
vigorous development policy for this mine.
The co. this month pays its third Is. divi-
dend out of the shoot—and it looks as if
there were many to follow. In addition 10s.
per share has been paid on preferences. Still,
the energetic campaign that was advised
hasn’t yet arrived, although present results
are satisfying the most avid shareholder.
The shoot, big as it looks likely to be, will
ultimately go the way of other shoots and
soon it will be time to look for others. And
existing indications are that the northern
ground contains other shoots.
Twelve months’ work (to Oct. 29) by the
Billy Hughes Co. (N.Q.) resulted in a loss of
£1339. A steam winding plant has been in-
stalled and the development of the Resurgam
mine is the chief objective. _ It has been
decided to issue 15,441 forfeited shares as
paid to 3s. at 2d. on application and 2d. on
allotment. That evidently is the Boards
opinion of the scrip.

C.S.A. (N.S.W.) increased its P. and L.
debit to £22,755 at the end of June; £1043
was the year’s addition. During the term
the only visible income was £176 in rents
from Kandos, and the outgo was £1219. Since
the accounts were closed an offer was
accepted and some of the buildings at Kandos
sold, and the report mentions that but for
this piece of business “a call would have had
to be made.” In a balance-sheet of £164,097
there is much vapor. Paid capital is £73,716;
plant reserve, £50,468; reserve, £14,118;
wastage of assets accounts, £21,668; credi-
tors, £2480; and overdraft, £1646. Mines
and leases are in at £41,062; main shaft,
£7884; mine development, £11,196; Cobar
buildings and plant. £37,147; Kandos ditto,
£32.336; water conservation, £4300. Stores
on hand at Cobar and Kandos are down at
£6058; ore on hand, £387; cash in bank,
£47; and book debts, £lO3.

Bush fires have swept the Adams River
(Tas.) osmiridium field, and, although a
good deal of damage was done, prospecting
will be easier—it can never be easy. A
record of 84oz. was got in one day from

won 74|oz. valued at £2200. About 1200
men are on the field.

Timor Petroleum has a nominal capital
of £200,000( in £1 shares, of which 60.000
fully-paids are to be issued as part payment
for concessions and rights, and 100,000 are
offered to the public. The vendor is Fred
Nomens, of Melbourne, who holds the option
from Timor Holdings Syndicate and Timor
Oil, Ltd. Nomens gets 10,000, and the
syndicate 5000 fully-paids and £lO,OOO cash.
Timor Oil, Ltd., is to be paid a cash royalty
of 2 p.c., and has the right for 12 months
after the export of oil in commercial quan-
tities of taking up at par shares amounting
to 20 p.c. of the subscribed capital. No ven-
dors’ shares are to be transferred until the
shares subscribed by the public have reached
£2 on the Stock Exchange and for 30 days
thereafter. This is the show which shipped
20 tons of crude oil to Australia as an indi-
cation of what had been found. The oil had
been bailed from shallow wells. Dr. Wade,
consulting geologist, recommends drilling to
1290 ft., and that will prove the real value
of the areas. If the concessions fulfil the
promise of developments thus far, the con-
sideration demanded is not unreasonable.
# * * *
“Kerogen”: Although Portuguese Timor
has been practically neglected geologically,
there is a wealth of information in the Dutch
Colonial Mines Department regarding the
Dutch portion of the island; and with Dutch
New Guinea, Timor is looked on as a future
oil-reserve for the Netherlands Indies. Like
every other oilfield in this belt, the general
strata are sands, clays, sandstone and shales,
with occasional belts of limestone overlying
or intercalated with the more porous sandier
phase at the base of the limestone. Dr.
Wade, who studied the formations at Meta-
I-lou and Irabin for the Timor Petroleum
Co., finds, as would be expected, typical anti-
clinal folding and upper oil-saturated lime-
stone-beds. This latter is unusual in the
belt as a whole, and probably represents an
original oil formed in situ in the limestones
and still present. It is possible to discover
further oil “sands” lower down in the series
underlying the denser limestones, but as all
oil is iikely to be at shallow depths (1200 ft.
or less), spectacular gushers should not be
expected. Java produces oil from wells at
shallow depths, and has been getting small
yields from single wells for years past in
very steady quantities; and Timor should
produce similarly; but the fact of the latter
country being closer to tlie older North-
Western Australia (part of the “buttress
against which the tertiary folding movements
were directed) may have induced conditions
different from those of the other Malayan
countries. Hence the necessity for detailed
surveying in the Portuguese territory to
ascertain whether the favorable oil condi-
tions known to exist in the Dutch portion
extend throughout the island, as the present
developments would indicate.

Lampeh (Siam) Tin Mines is to be re-
constructed by raising the amount payable
on the existing 100,000 shares from £1 to
£2. It has been decided to discard the suc-
tion-cutter dredge; the test extended over
18 months. A new bucket-dredge is to be
built, and its erection at the area is esti-
mated to cost £50,000, which it is proposed
to meet from calls on the *
It is believed that the fire in the mine of
Burma .Corporation, Ltd., is out. Progress
is being made in repairing the recovered
areas, but only so much of the sealed por-
tion is opened up at a time as can be dealt
with by the labor available. As many skilled
men as can be spared are being used for
that purpose.


ABOUT TIME HE WOKE UP!

“and it's

WIMBLE'S INKS”
“Nakhoda” : Amongst those who defied the
Compulsory Voting Act at the recent elec-
tions were members of the small sect which
has made all things ready for the ending of
the world. In view of the early arrival of
YOU NEVER CAN TELL.
“Somebody told me you had burglars in
the house.”
“I shouldn't be surprised. Some awful
people got in at the last election.”
this event they could regard even the donning
of the Priministerial spats by Donald Grant
with equanimity. The expected cataclysm
has been a movable feast for 1925 years-
in fact, since the beginning of our era, the
occurrences in Jerusalem at that time being
regarded as heralding the end of the old. In
1917 I found a Scotchman expecting it on
an island off the W.A. coast, and in 1924
a number of people committed suicide and
one man tried to destroy his family in pre-
paration for it. But the staunchest believer
I have met was a brother of the priest-king
of Solo, Java. He was in correspondence
with the Australian sect, and was expecting
the disaster hourly. The destruction of all
the non-believers of this generation he viewed
with calmness, if not pleasure, but was
worried as to whether his harem, whose
members* being women, had no souls, would
be exempted.
* * * *
“R.Q.”: Some of the 10 per cent, who
stayed away from the poll during the Federal
head-counting were more honest than some
of the 90 p.c. who went. One unoonscientious
objector in my electorate announced his in-
tention of registering an informal vote. The
law can’t get him. He hides behind the
skirts of people of the same ilk as the dear
old lady who remarked to me after it was
all over that she had made quite certain
the returning officer could get her if she
had marked her card wrongly: she had put
her name and address on it. But the most
punctilious non-voter in the Commonwealth
was the man who wrote to the Priminister
enclosing £2 and said he could not vote for
any candidate and retain his self-respect, so
he went to the polling-booth, had his name
crossed off the roll and handed in a blanji
paper. The Melbourne Hospital is now
richer by his conscience money.
* * * *
“Riwaka”: Some incidents in a Victorian
booth at the recent compulsory poll remind
me of the old saying about taking a horse to
water. When the usual question, “Have you
already voted either here or elsew'here in
these elections?” was put to one woman,
she retorted “No! And I don't w T ant to vote
now. You men ought to do your own dirty
work.” Across a ballot-paper containing the
names of two candidates for the Representa-
tives, a feminine hand had written, “Neither,
thanks!” It was a male voter, though, who
popffed a lead pencil into the box as he thrust
the ballot-papers into his vest pocket,

“H.E.R.”: Jim Brown, taking a load of
swedes into town, made mention about “gif-
tin’ hitched up when I come back,” and
naturally the Booker family was excited
over the prospect, for Jim had been “going
with” Janet Booker for over four years.
That night at the evening meal he was the
sole topic of conversation. He was too
"purply mean” for old Dad Booker, but Mum
—possibly after a mental comparison of the
swain with her husband —pronounced him
“not too bad.” Maud Booker, with visions
of all Janet’s work falling on her already
overloaded shoulders, considered Jim was no
good at all. “He’ll do me,” said young Bill,
enthusiastically; “ev’ry time I go to his
place he lets me put butter an’ jam on me
bread.” Janet listened to the for-and-against
discussion with flaming cheeks. "It’s me
he's going t<s marry,” she burst out at last,
‘'not you people.” During the stunned
silence that followed, the familiar rattle ot
Jim’s cart was heard. It stopped outside as
usual, and presently Jim's figure was framed
in the doorway. When he had finished the
“bite” that Dad Booker said it was a
pleasure to invite him to, he unbosomed him-
self. “Them swedes brought a rotten price
ter-day; knocked orl me plans ter pieces. 1
can’t see me way clear ter git married
now fer Gord knows when.”

“Chancery Lane” : In a recent Melbourne
probate case proof w T as required of the mar-
riage of the parents of a deceased lady. The
ceremony was believed to have taken place
at Wodonga, but no record could be found
at the Government Statist’s, and the church
records were also a blank. After weeks
of delay one of the interested beneficiaries un-
earthed an old identity who remembered
meeting the bride and bridegroom returning
from the church after the knot had been tied,
and deposed to having duly showered them
with rice he had carried with him in his
jinker for the purpose. As his evidence con-
firmed that already obtained as to the date
of the reputed marriage, the proof of matri-
mony was duly accepted.

“Macess”: He was one of the crowd
gathered in Queen-street, Brisbane, to watch
the posting of progressive returns on election
night, and it was plain that he’d found some
means of getting behind the regulation that
shut all pubs for the day. Rocking gently
to and fro, he closed one eye the better to
see some figures that were just being postexl.
They showed a decided majority for the
Labor candidate, and he cheered loudly, if
liouidly. A little later some new figures for
another district were put up. These dis-
closed a distinct advantage for the Nation-
alist candidate; but the watcher applauded
as enthusiastically as before. His companion,
who seemed slightly more sober, remonstrated
with him for his inconsistency. He listened
a while, and then shook a weighty finger
under the reproachful one’s nose. “Know
wha’sli wrong with you, Bill?” he said
gravely. “I’ll tell yer. Y’re b-biashed, tha sh

“Feng-Sliui”: The s.s. Klang, on which I
once had the quietest voyage of my experi-
ence, being the only passenger, was the scene
the other day in Singapore of excited doings.
She had 200 passengers this time, and one
was a Malay who presumably had found
another man “eating his rice” and felt life
was no longer worth living. When a Malay
feels that wav he commits suicide by indirec-
tion, and goes to the voluptuous heaven of
the Prophet as the rear-guard of as many
friends, relatives and strangers as possible.
In this case he stabbed 13 people, including
the captain, a Maorilauder, who went down
to argue with him verbally, although lie
had in his pocket the only argument a penga-
mok wall listen to—a revolver. A small
army of police arrived, who shot the would-
be suicide dead after efforts to calm him had
failed. In Java, where the complaint is
understood, the crowd gives the patient the
happy despatch he is asking for Without
delay". I once tvatched a young man come
tearing across the village square weaving a
reaping-knife and shrieking horribly. The
unanimity with which the crowd fell on
him and pounded him to dust was quite
surprising, in view of the sedate nature of

the race. It transpired in this case that the
mob had been too obliging, as the supposed
madman had only been running for help for
his aged mother, who was being gored by an
angry buffaio. It was felt, however, that the
young man deserved all he got, and that
society was justified in not taking any risks.

“Coot”: Kirk’s Bazaar, in Bourke-street,
Melbourne, the historic premises -where
horses have been
sold for 85 years,

time. Kirk’s was
the headquarters of
Cobb and Co. in

two native words
of the Kamilaroi
dialect gun d i

stream). Some
names are found to
have strayed from
the places to which
they were origi-
nally fixed. Cook's
Point Danger, for
instance, was quite
three miles away
from the one to
which the label is
pinned nowadays.
Cumbrae Stewart, registrar of the North-
ern University, is busying himself witli
the work, and a host of helpers are on the
hunt for clues.

“Coppertop”: The recent shipping strike
wasn’t the first time strikers have been
bluffed at Townsville (B. 19/11/’25). Dur-
ing the maritime strike of ’97, shearers who
had arrived by boat from Brisbane were
prevented from landing. There was no jetty
in those days, and all cargo was transhipped
into lighters at the anchorage and towed to
the Ross River wharves. As the tender was
towing in half a dozen lighters, the rearmost
one came adrift opposite the railway wharf as
if the tow-rope had been broken. A man in a
boat retrieved the stray barge and tied it
up to the wharf. At sundown the hatches

were removed and 50 shearers scooted for
a waiting truck with engine attached; before
dawn they were miles away. My dad worked
the trick. His co-operator is a leading
Queensland Laborite to-day.

DOLEUR DE ROSE,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I come as a craven
And suppliant wight,
Prom slumber’s soft haven
An exile o’ night,
Who wanders a desert, despairing,
Unknowing of light.
Not Phyllida’s flouting',
Unfair and unkind,
Not Phyllida’s pouting
Unsettles my mind,
Since Mavis or Doris or Clarice
As fetching I find.
No wearisome trouble
Of wealth or its dearth
Has burst, the fair bubble
Of sleep at its birth,
For haply I have in fair measure
The fulness of earth.
The gift, and the giver
Of life I esteem ;
No laxness of liver
To shadow its gleam,
Whole mind in whole body I harbor
Yet woe is my theme.
T come as a craven
And suppliant wight,
Who begs to be saven
Of sorrow to-night;
Unhappiness mine past enduring—
My roses have blight!

“Mudurup”: Sharks are plentiful enough
off the W.A. coast, but until recently there
was no record of any bather ever having been
attacked by one of the tribe. Many people
believed that there was some valid reason
for the immunity—a favored theory was that
sharks had so much natural food in western
waters that human beings had no attraction
for them —and that it would persist indefi-
nitely. But two or three years ago the vora-
cious scourge claimed its first victim in the
Swan River, a schoolboy. And last Sun-
day at Cottesloe, W.A.'s most frequented
beach, a shark swam in amongst a crowd of
bathers and took a second victim —this on a
foreshore where for a generation swimmers
have never hesitated to venture out for hun-
dreds of yards. From invincible optimism
west coast bathers are quite likely to swing
now to the other extreme. But why immunity
was enjoyed for so long remains a baffling
problem.

“Ex-Dig.”: There are 107 Austral!an _sol-
diers’ graves in Germany, amongst the 5089
wherein rest British prisoners-of-war who
died in captivity; and now the special ceme-
teries containing them have been passed over
to the control of the British War Graves
Commission by Act of the German Parlia-
ment. There was never any ground for com-
plaint about the respect of the Germans for
the graves of dead enemies during the war.
a fact which might well have disposed of
the preposterous “corpse-factory” canard. I
can recall a broken stretcher over a grave
THE HORRIBLE EXAMPLE.
“ I’m sure your mother never dolled up like that to get a husband!”
“No, daddy darling, and look at the husband she got!”
near Rake Zillebeke with the inscription
“Here lies a brave British stretcher-bearer”;
a small graveyard on a high ridge near Wys-
chaete, where the Germans had buried British
soldiers who fell in futile attacks on enemy
positions and had erected elaborate crosses
over them; and a grave near Meteren where
some soft-hearted Hun had carved in German
a simple verse of a child’s hymn over a little
one whose body had been discovered un-
buried. There was reciprocation of course.
Below 7 Wyschaete there was a simple cross
with the English inscription “To an Heroic
German.” I often wondered what form his
heroism had taken.
“Nakhoda”: The faked
photos, bogus letters and
alleged Fascist raids on
newspaper editors which dis-
tinguished the Federal elec-
tions suggest that we are
drifting away from sound
British models. They re-
semble too much a recent
case in India. In the middle
of a municipal election in a
big Indian city, a fakir fell
dead from boredom in a main
street where he was accus-
tomed to squat for alms. The
weather being warm, the
authorities hurried him un-
derground in the public ceme-
tery ; but somebody on rhe
opposition side discovered a
law ordaining that saints
should always be buried
where they died. Officialdom
refusing to disinter the holy
man, the mob was duly
aroused, the cemetery in-
vaded and the fragments of
piety dug up and replanted
in the street. This challenge
to law and order could not
be ignored, and the holy
ruin, now in a bad state of
disrepair and smelling hor-
ribly, was recovered and re-
stored to the cemetery, with
a military guard over it to
keep it down. Thereupon the
mob made an election issue
of if. so that the authorities
were constrained to dig up
what remained of the sainted
corpse, carry it in procession
and rebury it in the street.
Then it was discovered that
the alleged law was an in-
vention and the fakir a re-
tired murderer.
“Tip North”: In the days of the Palmer
rush (N.Q.), loading from Cooktown to
Byerstown soared to £lOO per ton. One
day a packer found a horse useless over the
stony ground, he having cast a shoe. No-
where could the man find horseshoe-nails.
Another carrier, Billy Yates, offered him
five nails for their weight in gold, and the
offer was immediately accepted. -The nails
were weighed out and- balanced by gold.
That afternoon the horse packed 1501 b. 11
miles at Is. per lb., so earning £7 10s.

“Sixenate”: Despite the doubts of Dean
Inge and other pessimists religious beliefs
still hold their
sway. A Melbourne
maintenance defen-
d ant to 1 d the
Bench with a sort
of fierce earnestness
that he would defy
t li e Omnipotent
Himself to live
happily with his
(witness's) wife
for a month; a
week, lie added,
would be the limit
even of Divine en-
durance. A muni-
eip a 1 contractor
scornfully remarked
that he would like
to see the Supreme
Being making any-
thing out of the
job (the removal
of some mullock)
at the price the
council was pre-
pared to pay for it.
A Melbourne publi-
can called the Crea-
tor to be his wit-
ness that he was
serving no beer at
the time alleged by
licensing police. All
this in one day’s
court proceedings.
A day or two
sooner a woman,
asked by counsel if
the defendant had
not used the words

to the plaintiff, admitted that he might have.
“He w T as always a religious man,” she added.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: According to
the S. M. Herald (19/U/’25) Mr. De
Gyulay, opening some new insurance build-
ings in Bond-street (Sydney), said that
Bond-street was once known as Robin Hood-
lane. He was in error; what was Robin
Hood’s-lane is now Dean’s-placc. In the
neighborhood of the present Bond-street,
William Hutchinson, a very early colonist,
had a block of land. Hutchinson was one
of the founders and a director of the Bank
of N. S. Wales; previously he ran what was
known as Hutchinson’s Bank, where people

in bond, or who had been in bond, deposited
their savings. His private residence was on
the s.-e. corner of King and George streets.
When the corner became too valuable for a
private dwelling-house he moved to the
corner of Pitt and Campbell streets. In
the mid-’fifties the Hutchinson family cut up
and sold the block on the George-street front-
age near Hunter-street, and a street was
run down the centre. This new road was
named Hutchinson-street, but in 1874 the
name was altered to Bond-street, as there
was another Hutchinson-street on Surry
Hills.

“Spare Corp": I wanted to bring back
the overcoat I wore on the Meteren sector
i n France; but its
draughtiiiess impelled me
to change it. We were
given the job of enlarg-
ing a very short trench,
and, cramped for room. I
tossed my overcoat, rolled
up in my pack, on to the
parapet whilst we tidied
up and extended. During
the night the Fritz
machine-gunners got a
frenzy, and their bullets
made a colander of my
pack. As the coat was
in several folds, each hole
was quadrupled at least;
as evidence of the stop-
ping power of cloth, sev-
eral bullets dropped out
of the coat when it was
dragged out. I looked
forward to hearing people
say when I should appear
in the garment, “How
did you escape being
killed?” But the holes
were so many, as I have
said, that I had to exchange the thing or
freeze.
“ ’Ungry ’Enry”: A propos N.S.W. Justice
Minister McKell’s action in introducing re-
creative features into the Ma State’s prison
system, the teaching of music might well
have been included. I found my own just
terminated sojourn at Bathurst Gaol materi-
ally relieved of its monotony by virtue of
the occupant of the adjoining cell being a
banjoist. Occasionally permitted to give
play to his musical emotions on a one-
string instrument improvised from a cigar-
box. he produced melody calculated to soothe
tile most savage breast. His repertoire was
certainly a trifle out of date, including
numerous ancient ditties such as “The Girl
I Left Behind Me.” etc. But that was hardly
to be wondered at. He hadn't been out for
nearly 10 years.
“Jim C’arcw” : Re queer finds inside flic
human anatomy (B. 12/11/’25).. A collide
of weeks back a Sydney surgeon removed
a half-crown from the stomach of a N.S.W.
South (Vi a si; dairy-farmer. Over 15 years
ago the man (he was a boy then : ) swallowed
the currency. He was put into hospital for
a fortnight, but the coin remained hidden,
and the boy was accused of imagining that
he had swallowed it —as he suffered no pain
he almost came to believe so himself. A
few months ago a severe pain in his side re-
called the episode, and he came to Sydney
for treatment. An X-ray photograph and
an operation did the rest.

“Hamer”: Melbourne Cup-time always
provides its queer accident. This year the
man was holding converse with a friend who
owns a garage, when he noticed that he had
only a feAv minutes to catch a train. Hur-
riedly he opened and dashed through the
nearest door—and woke up ih hospital. The
door gave entrance to the garage show-win-
dow. and it was through this that the luck-
less person crashed. It took the hospital
people an hour to pick the glass out of him.

“Flicker" : The civic fathers in our suburb
have recently taken to tree-planting, and
the street in which I reside is to be bordered
with Norfolk Island pines. They take a
long time to grow, but a neighbor of mine
who originally came from what is now the
Irish Free State dislikes them for a different
reason. “ ’Tis a disgrace for thim to be
putting those threes down in a free coun-
try,” he confided to me. “D’ye know now”
—here his voice was lowered confidentially—
“people do be telling me that the name of
thim is North av Ireland pines 1 ’! And he
added, as he went his way: “Not another
vote does one av th' council get from me.”
“Miro”: The other Sunday morning we
hired a boat at the Spit and set out for a
picnic up Middle (Sydney) Harbor. In a
sequestered cove we lauded and boiled the
billy, and had just settled down for a peace-
ful afternoon when a launch with a beer-
barrel strapped to her stern hove in sight.
Out of her streamed 50 or 00 men of all
sorts and conditions, who, glancing neither
to right nor left, streaked up the hillside and
disappeared into the bush. The captain alone
remained, refreshing himself with a comic and
a bun, and wearing an air of having nothing
whatever on his mind. Then things began
to happen. Solitary figures stood Napoleon-
like on projecting rocks and gazed sombrely
over the bay, heads bobbed unexpectedly
from behind bushes, grey forms slipped un-
obtrusively along secluded paths. In an-
swer to our query as to what attraction lay
beyond the hilltop the captain replied shortly.
“A pub,” and returned to his comic and
bun. We wore still speculating on the re-
markable popularity of the over-hill pub
THE GIVE AWAY.
“Thinking of me, dear?”
“Was I laughing? I'm so sorry!”
when the wanderers returned, some looking
disgusted, others resigned, and a few well
satisfied with themselves. The launch pre-
pared to up-anchor, and we began our home-
ward pull. Then it was that a genial soul
in the larger craft observed loudly over his
beer that rowing was hard word for ladies,
and insisted on our hitching on. In this
fashion we trailed down-stream, and at the
Spit were cast off by our kind-hearted towers.
We had scarcely touched shore when an
aggrieved relative descended on us. “How
dare you,’' he boomed —“how dare you come
back in this disreputable manner!” We
hastened to explain about the kind gentle-
men in the launch who had offered us a
tow\ “On a Sunday, too!” continued the
censorious one bitterly; “and I come down
here and find you being towed round the
harbor by a two-up school!”
THE PASSING OF CLOVERNOOK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I am a native, and love the old cable-car, and
would feel sad at its passing. If every city in the
world has ugly, disfiguring, almost vulgar electric-
ears, I do not see why Melbourne should follow their
wretched example.”
The restless, roaring rampant world
Onward and ever onward presses;
The silences we knew are hurled
Into oblivion’s recesses,
And Progress slaughters, void of ruth,
The pleasant villages of youth.
The city once was Clovernook,
A village kissed by wood-sweet zephyrs,
Where life its even tenor took
As placid as a mob of heifers.
There rose, where now the tumult tires,
The curling smoke of homely fires.
Ah me! where once the smithy made
His music with the clanging hammer,
The wheels of modern toil and trade
Whirl in the midst of shrilling clamor;
The storeyed pile its bulk upheaves
High o’er where stood the cottage eaves.
The world, as life from youth to age
Moves on and on, it brooks no staying;
Whilst we, still loath to turn the page,
Resentful, strive for its delaying,
And with a sense of longing look
Back to the day's of Clovernook,
VICTORIA.

F. M. F'orde, once again Federal member
for Capricornia (Q.), owes his safety amidst
Labor landslides to sheer hard work. As a
“roads-and-bridges man” he has no superior
in Australian politics, and as a letter-
writer to his con-
stituents he has
broken all previous
Parliamentary re-
cords. When there
are no speeches to
be made, questions
to be asked in the
House or letters to
be written, he tours
his immense elec-
torate giving lec-
tures on his tra-
vels. . The industri-
ous young man took
a day off to get
married a few
months ago. He
has always found
time to be the best-
dressed man of his
party.

One of the most human stories told of the
late Queen Alexandra, not known until Sir
Frederick Treves, one-time Court surgeon,
gave the facts in one of his books, concerns her
visit to the famous “Elephant Man.” He
was a patient in a London hospital whose
face was so frightfully deformed that even
the most seasoned Sister of Mercy felt her
resolution fail when she had to,.,attend to
him. When E'dward Vll.’s lady heard that
the man was pining for communion with his
kind, she did wliat few queens or commoners
would care to do—she paid, the atavistic un-
fortunate a bedside visit, read to him and held
his hand without betraying' %‘iny indication
of repulsion.
Ages of Chief Justices: Adrian Knox
(High Court), 62, on Nov. 29; Irvine (Vic.)
and McMillan (W.A.), 67; Murray (S.A.),
62; Street (N.S.W.), 62; Nicholls (Speck),
57; and Blair (Q.) 54. McMillan (ap-
pointed Chief Justice in 1913) has been the
longest in office.
Though death has struck down most of
the original Commonwealth Senators, the
W estralian six are still going strong. S.tani-
forth Smith, who headed the poll in 1901, is
Administrator of Papua; Harney is in the
House of Commons; Norman Ewflng is a
I asmanian Judge; Matheson, now a
Scottish baronet, is living at present in
Maonland; De Largie helps his son to run a
Westralian farm; and the miraculously luckv
Pearce has been elected for the sixth time.
1 earce will be the only 1901 Senator in the
next 1 arliament, but unless something goes
wrong he will be joined by Josiah Thomas,
who was M.H.R. for Barrier in 1901. Of
the 75 men elected for the first House of
Reps., only Hughes. Watkins and Chapman
will sit in the tenth.
Two candidates—-Collie, in Brisbane, and
Southwick, in Calare—lost their deposits on
l4. But they need not: be cast
down. Not a few persons to whom success
came later have lost deposits at Federal
elections. The list includes G. M. Burns,
for Illa warra 1910-17 (Parkes
1901) ; N.S.W. Judge Beeby (Parkes 1903) •
Andy Lysaght, M.L.A. for Wollondillv (Illa-
waxra 1901) ; Arthur Itae, N.S.W. Senator

Also, when ,T. 11. Catts got 17,271 votes for
Cook in 1910, a certain Thomas Walsh
secured 661.
Three of the officers selected by General
Birdwood for his personal staff of four as
Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army are
Australians; and the native press, always
sensitive about the Commonwealth’s color-
line principles, is apparently annoyed about
it. Lieut.-Col. G. G. E. Wylly is a Tas-
manian who won the V.C. in the Boer War;
afterwards he joined the Indian Army, and
was A.D.C. to Kitchener for four years. In
the Great War he saw service with the A.I.F.
Third. Division and the Anzac Corps, as wefl
as with the first British forces that reached
1 ranee. Captain Keith Dawson has been in
the Indian Army since the war. He left a
job. in a Melbourne bank to enlist, and, de-
ciding that soldiering w r as his forte, never
returned to it. N. S. Wales is represented
by Davenport, the medical officer of the staff;
he, too, has been long absent from Australia.
The recent election of native members
for Maoriland’s House of Reps, recalls a
unique event. In 1908, Hone Ileke, grand-
nephew of the warrior chief, was elected for
the Northern electorate. He died in Welling-
ton early in 1909, before the House opened.
According to Maori custom, it was incum-
bent upon the people of the South to return
the body to the North, where it could be
buried in the sacred resting-place of Heke's
ancestors. A great gathering of chiefs
headed by the silver-tongued Timi Kara
(James Carroll) took the corpse up to
Kaikolie, wdiere a historical tangi took
place. Then the tribe was faced with the
business of choosing a new rep. in Parlia-
ment, and with repaying the action of the
Southern chiefs in returning the body. At
a meeting in the pa at Kaikohe, Hone Heke’s
mother rose and said that she regarded the
seat left in the House by her son as her
son’s widow. “Therefore,” she said, “let us
show our appreciation of the kindness of the
Southerners by marrying my son’s ‘widow’
to one of their chiefs.” This remarkable
suggestion was approved, and it was left to
James‘Carroll to decide who the bridegroom
would be. After three days he gave his deci-
sion in favor of Te Rangihiroa (Dr. Peter
Buck, the noted anthropologist and Director
of Maori Hygiene at Auckland). Without
making a single speech he was returned with
an overwhelming majority, and spent three
years as the “husband” of Heke’s “widow.”
Next session he stood again and went in
flying.
A line sportsman was James Aldridge, just
dead in Adelaide at 76. He was an early
entry at St. Peter’s school, spent years in
the N.T. surveying under Goyder and with
telegraph parties, and then became a hotel-
keeper. He had the now-vanished Globe, in
Rundle-street, Adelaide, when it was the
home of the sporting community in general
and the infant Tattersall’s Club in parti-
cular. He had the Grand at Broken Hill in
the early days of the silver boom. Back in
Adelaide, he kept the Gresham. Then, about
1890, he founded the Richmond Park stud in
S.A., and bred any number of winners. Like
his brother George, who was at one time
chairman of the Stock Exchange, he had
charming manners, and the Richmond home
was the scene of much hospitality.
The late Premier “Farmer Bill” Massey is
responsible for a vote of £12.117 on the M.L.
supplementary estimates, allocated as fol-
lows : Funeral expenses, £1000; beautifying
area around tomb, Point Halswell (tree-
planting, etc.), £117; Government contribu-
tion to national memorial (on account),
£5000; to Mrs. Massey, £6OOO. The £6OOO is
the same amount as was paid to the widow
of Dick Seddon.

united Opposition in Bananaland, is already
hailed as the next Premier of the State which

Queenslander by adoption, and farmer by

when his time comes.
“Sigs": Donald McLelann Grant, who is
bearing the brunt of Labor’s defeat in N. S.
IV ales, is a long, fair-haired, talkative Scot,
who came to Australia in 1909. lie was never
a member of the 1.W.W., but was one of the
early brethren of the International Socialist
party that harbored Harry Scott-Bennett,
Henry Holland (now a Maoriland M.P.)
and Jock Wilson, another tongue-thrashing
Scot whB escaped the I.W.W. round-up and
afterwards got a paid job with a Liverpool
(Eng.) Labor union. Grant, who went in
for a 15-year term with the other 11 “wob-
blies,” was one of the star speakers of the
Reds m the war-days, and was welcome on
any of the Domain platforms. He did four
years of his sentence, and came out on Royal
Commissioner Ewing’s recommendation. He
is still only 30.
A pioneer Australian woman telegraph-
operator died the other day. Miss Gertrude
Mary Creagh surprised, and no doubt
shocked, some of her friends when in 1874
she decided to enter the old Vic. Postal De-
partment. It was a plucky thing for a girl
to do in those mid-Victorian days. However,
she survived to become a post-mistress, and
retired 15 years ago, after having success-
fully S.M. d several big country offices.
Windsor (N.S.W.) is amongst the very
few towns in Australia that have a sky-
pilot to dispense justice from the police-court
bench. Rev. N. Jenkyn is the rector of the
historic church of St. Matthew, and in be-
tween sermons, church and choir meetings
and so forth he takes his seat on the Wind-
sor Bench and tempers mercy with justice.
Not content with all these troubles, he is
now a candidate for the Municipal Council.
Drowned in tragic circumstances at Glen-
elg (S. A. ) Adrian Korff, known to Bulletin
readers as “Flicker.” Korff, a returned sol-
dier, was concluding his law course this year ;
failure to pass an exam, apparently wounded
him too sorely. A popular figure at Adel-
aide University, he edited the magazine in
1924, w r as a member of the Law Students’
Committee and handled the publicity and
entertainments for the Oxford Debaters’
tour. A prolific writer of pars, and a ver-
sifier of some charm, he might have made a
first-rate journalist. An attractive and in-
teresting essay of his on marriage customs
appeared in the Woman’s Mirror the day
after his death.
Grosvenor Francis, who unexpectedly be-
comes member for Kennedy (Q.) through the
death of Charley McDonald, is a Charters
Towers (Q.) solicitor who has had his brass
plate nailed there since 1901. He was born
at Normanton back in the days when that
Gulf-river hamlet busied itself with supply-
ing the needs of Croydon, then a town of
some tonnage and big gold returns: his
father was one of the old band of Queensland
police-magistrates. The new member’s pre-

When in 1917 W. J. McKell, now Premier
Lang’s Minister for .Justice, entered the
N.S.W. Parliament, after beating ex-Premier
Jimmy McGowen, he was the “baby” of the
House, being only 25. Three years later he
and _ E. A. McTiernan were the youngest
Ministers in the Storey and later in the
Dooley Government. His admission as r. bar-
rister last week marks still another stage in
the youthful and serious-minded politician’s
upward slide. A Pambula (N.S.W.) native,
McKell is an instance of what determination
and a good head can do. He left school at
13 and ran messages for a chemist before
entering Mort’s Dock as an apprentice. A
logical and temperate debater, he commands
respect from all parts of the House. Other
members or ex-members of his party who
have been called to the Bar while in poli-
tics are Hughes, Holman, R. D. Hall and
T. S. Crawford ; and three of his present
Labor colleagues, Attorney-General McTier-
nan, H. V. Evatt and Andy Lysaght, are
also members of the Devil’s Brigade.
Dead in Adelaide, at 71, John Bailes, wbo
introduced Angora goats to Centralia. At
one time he had a healthy herd of 2000 at
Blood’s Creek, the largest ever mustered in
the North.
Archdeacon Thomas, of North Queens-
land, having accepted the call to the vacant
see of Willochra, there will now be two
Anglican prelates in S. Aus. with the sur-
name of Thomas. The Bishop of Adelaide
will continue to be known as Nutter Thomas
so as not to confuse the Recording Angel.
L. M. Isitt, shifted to the M.L. Upper
House, is used to “calls.” When in a glove
business in England Isitt got the call to
M.L., and became a Methodist parson
at Auckland in 1881. Next he was called to
lay aside the dog-collar in order to stump
the Ricketty Dies on the Dry ticket. The
next ea.ll was to go to England to carry on
the anti-liquor tight, and he spent ten years
there. Back again, Isitt was elected to the
House of Reps, for Christchurch North in
1911, and hung there till the call came the
other day to settle in the cushions of the
Upper House.
“Gallery” : Just dead Teddy Warde could
produce anecdotes for all occasions. One of
his latest was uncorked while the House w r as
debating the State Employees’ Superannua-
tion Bill recently. The question was the
compulsory contribution of permanent em-
ployees. Warde thought that a certain
amount of compulsion was good for one.
The dictum, he added, was recognised by the
Scot, who, coming home late with a bad'cold,
told the wee wifie to make him a strong glass
of toddy—and see that he took it whether he
was willin’ or nae.
“Sim” : While I was on the soap-box for
the Labor candidate of a tony Sydney divi-
sion I noticed the original-minded chairman
busy with a fountain-pen and a heap of tele-
gram blanks. When I stepped off I learnt
the wherefore. “Before introducing the next
speaker,” he said, “I have a few telegrams

What use to be a mentor
Of men and an inventor
In earth’s great hub and centre
Where fame and wealth accrue,
What gifts can gods provide you
Through dreary days to tide you
If stingo is denied you
When you are seventy-two?
What boots a life devoted
Viito achievements noted,
A shihing name that’s quoted
And lauded near and far,
In lands where laws resistant
Make pubs dim dreams and distant,
Where beers are non-existent
Nor any porters are ?
Blow eminence and dollars
And bays they wreathe for scholars 1
Brown jugs I crave with collars
Atop, of snowy foam.
The Volstead veto thuds on
Most anything with suds on
In homes beside the Hudson—
Hence Hudson leaves his home.
There’s treble V and double
In Burton vats a-bubble,
And no teetotal trouble
In parts like those, I guess.

Go dry beside the Liffey,
Particularly if he
Is partial to Guinness.
For hooch I never hankered,
Or all the rum that’s anchored
Along “The Row’’ —a tankard
Is all to grip I’m fain.
How slowly I’ll up-end it,
How lovingly commend it—
And peradventure send it
To be re-filled again!
My nut-brown ale! I miss it,
But here my lips may kiss it
Only in joints illicit;
I needs must cross the sea.
0 folly crass and frantic,
Stupidity gigantic,
That puts the wide Atlantic
Between my beer and me!

“Tamornio”: Flying-foxes are systomati
cally trapped by the
natives of the Titape
district of New Guinea
for - food and for their
teeth, which are used
in baiter with other
natives. The giant bats
come in from the
hinterland to the
coastal belt at night,
and have to fly over a
range of low hills,
always crossing at
about the same place.
Where these crossing-
places are noted, lanes
are cut through the
bush over the crest of
the hill, and to poles
attached to the tree-
tops on either side are
suspended light nets so
arranged that they can
be lowered by cords.
When it is almost dark
the nets are hauled into
position and the opera-
tor can feel by the
vibration of the cords
when several foxes are
enmeshed, whereupon
the net is lowered and
the catch killed. In
certain places, notably
near Kaut, the lanes
cut on the hilltops are
so close as to give to
the bush there the
appearance of lines of
cypress- or pine-trees.
The flesh of the flying-
fox is agreeable enough
if natural repugnance
at the appearance of
the creature can be
overcome. It is best
after having been
buried in sand for 24
hours, as this removes
the musky odor.
“The Outcast”: Many years ago on a
N. S. Wales show ground I met a foreigner, one
Antonio, a tamer of wild parrots and snakes, who
travelled from show ground to show ground. Tony
had about 40 different varieties of wrigglers, which
he kept in quarter fruit-cases lined with blanket.
I was talking to him one day at his camp outside
Orange when a couple of young fellows passing by
remarked that about a quarter of a mile back they
had seen a large black snake crawl into a pile of
logs. Tony pricked his ears at this and we set out
on the snake hunt, Tony carrying with him a piccolo.
Arrived at the pile of logs he insisted on silence,
and directed me to get on top of the pile, and
when the snake appeared clear of it to quietly drop
my hat alongside. He himself then stood some
dozen yards away and started a lively tune on the
piccolo. Presently the snake put its head and
half its body out from under the logs. Tony then
altered his tune to a kind of droning dirge. The
snake, a good 7ft. in length, continued to crawl
slowly towards the music. When it was well clear
of the logs Tony signalled to me and 1 dropped my
hat. The crawler immediately stopped and Tony
NO SNOBBERY ABORT HIM.
“Cuthbert, you mustn’t play with those boys — they're not nice!”
“Gan I fight with them then?”
left off playing. lie then walked slowly towards
the snake, which seemed fascinated by the hat. At
last he stood over it, and with a quick downward
movement ■ caught the reptile behind the head.
Hissing and twirling, it fought hard to escape.
Presently, however, it quietened down, and Tony put
it in a sugar-bag and carried it back to camp. There
in an open space he proceeded to give us a fine
exhibition of snake charming. Dropping the snake
out of the bag - , a lively scene commenced. At first
the wriggler tried to get away, but Tony was all
alert, and quickly brought it back. Then the
snake became desperate and started to charge, hissing
viciously. It took the charmer all his time, to dodge
it. At last, tired out, Tony caught it about 'one-
third down the body and raised it in the air. There,
despite the vicious efforts of the snake to bite him, he
simply played with it until it showed, signs of
exhaustion, when he clamped it ihto one of his snake
boxes. The same season I met Tony at Nyngan
show. Whilst talking to him in his tent with the
sides rolled up before business had commenced, a
man lialf-seas over lurched in and struck against
the boxes of captives. Over they went, and snakes
escaped in all directions. Tony, cursing loud and
deep, grabbed up snakes by the armful, and thrust
them into their boxes. He did not get a bite
while thus engaged, but later on the same day, when
showing to a tent full of people, he brought out
the large black snake he had caught at Orange—
a vicious creature. While holding it close to his face,
gripping it as usual behind the head, it slipped
through his fingers and fastened on Tony’s nose.
Quickly squeezing the snake off, he dropped it back
into the box and then, slashing the point of his nose
with a razor, pressed from it as much blood as he
could and sprinkled it with a white powder.
An hour afterwards he was performing to a full
house, and having revenge on the black snake by
tormenting it and making it do double work.

“Balala”: “Pyramus” (B. 29/10/’25) is
right in his advocacy of the preservation of abo-
riginal rock carvings. At Kuring-gai Chase, Port
Hacking and near Glenbrook (N.S.W.) are excellent
specimens of native carvings of wallabies, fishes and
birds which the weather and tourists are rapidly
obliterating because they are quite unprotected.
Mosman (Sydney) council recently took steps to
preserve some fine carvings of wallabies and fishes at
Edwards Beach. Other municipal bodies might
well follow its example.
* * * *
“Lilli-Pilli” : In the bar of the Shearers’
Arms half a dozen men were having the time of
their lives tormenting an extremely tall and appa-
rently mentally-deficient young fellow. They hid
his beer, banged his hat down over his eyes, and
vied with each other in inventing indignities to
heap upon him. The victim merely grinned and
made no attempt to retaliate. “Poor old Johnny!”
said the storekeeper, when we got outside, “he is
always a butt for the jokes of everyone. No, he’s
not exactly ‘touched.’ No spirit! I’ve seen the
very school kids doing everything short of killing
him, but he’d only grin like a goat in a cabbage-
patch and take it all. I dunno! It seems as
though some are born to” Sounds of strife
issuing from the pub interrupted the storekeeper
and we hastened back expecting to see the tormen-
tors fighting amongst themselves. But the tormen-
tors we saw wore wearing expressions of dizziness
and astonishment, and were reclining upon the floor.
Above them towered Johnny, and he was passion-
ately exhorting them to rise and allow him the
pleasure of knocking them down again, and the?' all
seemed reluctant. Gradually the storekeeper calmed
him, then sought an explanation. “One of ’em
kicked me dorg,” he said, simply.
* * * #
“Din” : I rise to second the timely protest
of “J.H.S.” (B. 15/10/’25) against the unnecessary
suffering caused our bush animals by the use of the
steel-wire trap. Only the other day, in taking a
little-used track through the scrub, I came upon a
wallaby doe dead in a snare. It was evident from
the marks that she had put up a desperate struggle
to free herself after being caught by the leg, and
finally, after days of agony, had died of starvation.
Near by was her dead baby, which she had appa-
rently thrown out of her pouch to give it a last
chance when she saw her own case was hopeless. At
the opening of every ’possum season youths armed
to the teeth with snares, and with a fortune in
the mind’s eye of each, go into the scrub and set
their traps at every likely spot. After a few
daily rounds without the expected hauls, enthusiasm
wanes and the trappers go off without collecting
all the snares. Every forgotten trap may be the
cause of a dreadful and lingering death to some
poor furry creature. It’s a cruel business.
* * » #
“Centre” : “Dominie’s” mention of a small
girl out back who wore a penny securely tied over
a boil because “copper drors boils’’ (B. 29/10/’25)
recalled some first-aid methods I’ve witnessed in
N. Queensland. Once the small boy while fooling
with dad’s axe contrived to badly gash his leg
above the knee. The youngster ran howling to ma,
leaving a trail of blood behind him. Ma, as usual,
was equal to the occasion; after administering the
expected clout over the head, she dragged the suf-
ferer to the yard through which the drain ran that
carried off the house-water, etc. There she scooped
a generous handful of awful-looking mud from the
edge and clapped it over the wound, yelling mean-
while for Mary to “bring them rags an’ string.” I
watched the “cure” securely tied in position to the
accompaniment of a running fire of reproofs from
ma and continuous howls from Willie. The job
completed, the lady turned and explained, in answer
to my expressed surprise regarding the mud, that
it “beat the band for sores.”
* * * *
“The Rumpus” : Has any member of the
Council ever heard of lightning curing blighted
plants and fruit-trees ? During a heavy downpour
interspersed with strong sheet-lightning, I remarked
to an orcliardist how much good the rain would do,
and he replied, “The lightning’s better for me. All
my apple-trees are blighted.” This I knew for a
fact. A few days later I again examined the trees.
Not a sign of blight could be seen.

A MULGA TRAGEDY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, strange the things they have to say
In far-off Mulga town
Of wonders that befell one day
To James Augustus Brown.
All Mulga knew him just as Jim,
Since Mulga gave him birth.
And many a year had rated him
A citizen of worth.
He grew in civic knowledge there
Quite early, as a lad;
He surely would have been the mayor
If mayor they’d ever had.
But of him it could ne’er be told
He took a narrow view;
No Mulga merely to behold
But other places, too,
Had ever been his wise intent;
Where others walked it blind,
The world, wide-eyed, he scanned and bent
On politics his mind.
The fate of states and empires wide
He settled with a will;
No Government from him could hide
The faults of each new bill.
He read by day, he dreamed by night
Of statesmen great and small,
And ventured views most erudite
On things political.
And nightly at Maguire’s Hotel
They listened long to Jim,
Not eagerly, perhaps, but—well.
They couldn't silence him.
A WAY OUT.
MRS. KENSO-BROWNE : “This is too bad, Norah! You’ve broken
as many cups and saucers and plates and dishes and things
this month as your wages amount to. Now, how can we
prevent the same thing happening again?”
NORAH: “I dunno, ma’am, unless you raise me wages.”
When Bruce, electioneering-bound,
Through Mulga made his way,
Not he but James Augustus found
By far the most to say.
And all agreed in Mulga town
(Though that is not the rule)
They’d never heard, than Jimmy Brown,
A duller, damneder fool.
They sneered at him behind his back
With actions none too nice;
Could Bruce, they asked, survive the lack
Of Jimmy’s sage advice?
They held him everywhere to scorn;
They japed and jeered at Jim
Until the next new-scented morn
A message brought to him.
A wire that read, “Arriving train
To-night; if you are loose
Would like to hear your views again
That matter. —Signed, S. Bruce,”
The township “postie,” Gabbitall,
Soon passed the news around;
Through home and store and Shire Hall
It spread by leap and bound.
It sped, as stone from catapult,
For miles, that startling word:
“Stan Bruce is coming to consult
With Jimmy; have you heard?”
Until was never man nor child
In all of Mulga town
But gaped in awe where once they’d smiled
At James Augustus Brown.
They feted him; from day to dark
Maguire’s Hotel was filled;
They swallowed there with wonder stark
The wisdom that he spilled.
They chaired him to the station when
The train at dusk fell due;
The platform seethed with shouting men
Whose numbers ever grew.
The train drew in; and one stepped down
Who didn’t overmuch
Resemble statesmen of renown,
Prime Ministers and such.
He goggled at the wild array, -.
While someone said “Be dam’!”
Then, spotting Jim, he shouted, “Hey !
D’yer get my telegram?”
Oh,, sick grew Jimmy, then and white,
And hushed the cheering crowd,
And heavily the quiet night
Fell on them like a shroud.
’Tvvas old Sam Bruce of farther out,
And “Yairs,” he said, “that’s how!
I telegrammed to see y’ about
That matter of the cow.”
Now harsh the things they have to say
To James Augustus Brown,
. Whose fame uprose with piping day,
And with the sun went down.
QUEENSLAND.

“Outback”: “Biroobi” asks (B. 8/10/’25)
whether jacky-winter and the ground-lark are iden-
tical. If the birds -were alike one could understand
the confusion. The lark is the bigger bird, spends
its time .on the ground, and when disturbed flies
FAITHFUL IN ALL THINGS.
“Will you kindly give this parcel to Mr. Brown? It’s his shaving
things and slippers.”
jerkily along, landing on the ground several yards
away. In color it is a distinct brown. Moreover,
it migrates northwards every winter, though some-
times a number of the birds do not join in the
movement. Its nest is placed at the base of a
tussock. Jacky-winter, on the other hand, is nearly
grey, and is much smaller. He is seen generally
on stumps watching the surrounding area for the
movement of some insect. Jacky and family build
the flimsiest of nests, so small that it escapes notice
except when the bird is sitting on it. Even then the
grey surroundings hide it. One wonders how the
eggs fit into the small structure. Jacky stays all
the year in and is found throughout the State of
N. S. Wales.
“Hargo”: The porker is not the only
“bov that pays the rent.” At Lisieux, Euchareena
(N.S.W.), there is a ewe which presented her
owner with four lambs in 14 months —one on August
20, 1924, another on April 6, 1925, and twins on
October 22, 1925. She is a six-tooth comeback.
Last year she cut 91b. of wool, this year 101b., and
her last year’s wether lamb yielded a 121b. fleece.

V erity” : This will take a lot of beating
for canine intelligence. An Adelaide suburban
orchardist owns an aged black spaniel which has
achieved a great reputation among his friends for
intelligence. Two seasons ago the orchardist and
his son were pruning peach-trees, accompanied by
Dan, the dog. Dan is in the habit of fetching
numerous articles whose names are familiar to him,
While pruning, the orchardist left his toolbox con-
taining a pruning-saw some distance down the row
of trees. He found a piece of wood too big for
his snips. “I’ll need the saw here,” he remarked
to his son, and, turning to the dog-, added, “Go and
get the box, Dan.” Dan trotted down the row and
returned with the saw. He had extracted it from
a number of other tools, and had left the box be-
hind.
“ J.C.B.”: In March, 1924, I was pulling
corn where carpet-snakes were plentiful, and 1 began
to catch and sell such as were over six feet in
length. One I had was well under standard, and not
being able to get rid of it I kept it in a box till
last month. During its 18 months’ imprisonment it
would neither eat nor drink, and yet it never got
any thinner. It shed its skin twice. In the finish
I got three half-crowns for it. Does any Abo. know
of other snakes fasting for so long at a stretch?

“Polycarp”: Bauanaland leads easily in
the protection: of native birds and animals, and its
last Animals and Birds Act is the most comprehen-
sive ever passed in Australia. Only 14 birds in
the northern State are not protected, and this list
includes five introduced kinds. There are over 100
sanctuaries and reserves, a good many of them
being islands off the coast, but the chief difficulty
is supervision of the gun-fiend over such large areas.
Hinchinbrook (97,280 acres), Bellenden Ker (79,000
acres) and Stradbroke Island (78,720 acres) are
the main national parks, each with its own forest
rangers to cope with marauders.
“Gouger”: Formerly the Darnley and
Murray Islanders never buried their dead, preferring
to sun-dry them and
lash the withered
article to a bamboo
framework. The skin
was thickly smeared
with colored ochre,
though whether as a
preservative or not I
don’t know. Big round
eyes of mother-of-
pearl hinged with
cowrie-shells gave the
silent deceased a hair-
raising appearance.
Each villa had its own
domestic “dead-house,”
in which were spiked
the family skulls. The
dried hands were con-
sidered a chic orna-
ment by the women,
and adorned the necks
of flappers as their
shapely bodies whirled
in the dance. The
islanders’ loaf-shaped
huts were barricaded
at night to exclude the
spirits of ithe dead,
who walked the vil-
lages and tried to gain
entry. Their spirit is
called Lamoor, which
means white man.
Across on Cape York
Peninsula the ghost is
Murki, which also
means white man.
This, I suppose, is
due to the universal
native belief that the
nigger “comes up”
white. The Lamoor is
no silent ghost, but
makes his complaints
in a loud tone, and is
liable to break things.
All of his species have
extremely large hands,
a blow from which is
sufficient to kill a liv-
ing man. Despite mis-
sionary influence I have
not yet met an islander yvho has not seen and heard
the spirit.
“Q. Cliff”: “Polycarp” is wrong in his
estimate of Binghi’s taste (B. 22/’lO/’2o). You
can’t catch Binghi tripping when it comes to tell-
ing by taste whether a thing is good to eat or not.
Ive tried him with various foods quite unknown to
him, and he has never gone wrong. He has to
depend on his taste in his selection of fruit and
root foods and, though some of his vegetables might
not appeal to our palates, he knows what is good
and safe to eat. Personally I should say that his
sense of taste is far more highly developed than
that of the average civilised white man.
“Bokeen”: Re kangaroo stalking (B.
8/10/’25). Forty jears ago, in the Pilly Scrubs,
Port Lincoln (S.A.), we used moccasins made of the
tail of the kangaroo or the “knee” of an emu.
These were slit and laced on so as to leave the hard
side under the foot, and were very comfortable and

quite noiseless on the rough jagged limestone, where
thick scrub stopped a shot at more than 20 or 30
yards. Once when hurrying along a pad about dusk,
and without a rifle, I ran up to a boomer with his
head turned from me, licking himself under his
arm. On the idiotic impulse of the moment I
caught him by the neck from behind with both
hands, and the jump he gave literally carried me
down the track some yards, swinging on his back.
A murderous struggle that seemed to last for three
weeks ended in my letting go the first moment it was
safe to do so, and slipping behind a handy she-oak.
After glaring at each other for a little while we
both Went home unconquered.
“Percy”: Immigrants find some stumbling-
blocks in our language. Recently one was told to
go to the back of a paddock to see if there were
any horses hanging on a fence, and if so to drive
them to water. He returned and informed a harassed
boss that “l'heer worn’t any hoorses ahangin’ on
the fence ’z'actly, but one had his head ahangin’ over
it loike.”

“M.G.”: A great deal has been said about
the dancing of the brolga, or native companion,
but I have heard no mention
of the similar corroborees of
the crested pigeons. The less
conspicuous size and color of
these birds probably accounts
for this. The pigeons form a
group of six or eight, and
begin their dance in stately
fashion, by strutting and grace-
ful) bowing. During recent
months quite a number of these
birds have made the Murray
swamps their headquarters,
probably owing to a drought
in the interior. I have had
several opportunities of watch-
ing their quaint dances, but in
every case, as soon as my
cautious approach was detected,
the pigeons gave a call very
like the tinkle of a small
distant bell, and flew away.
Unlike the brolgas, which hold
their corroborees only at sun-
rise, the crested pigeons per-
form their dances at any convenient moment.

“Kriz”: The Chinese consider the muscle
portion of the oyster found in pearlshell a great
delicacy, and pay lugger crews £ 3 per rice-bag for
it. This portion of the oyster is cut away and hung
in the rigging to dry; after drying it is salted,
bagged and taken ashore when the lugger goes into
a port for water or stores. It makes good soup when
fresh from the shell.
“I.L.I.”: About the most sudden surprise
awaiting the N.Q. bushman arrives when, whistling
cheerily in the saddle, he brushes against a wasp’s
nest. These devilish pests build their residentials
on the hanging leaves of bushes, and are generally
felt before they’re seen. They mob a man in
fury and sting with
wonderful quickness.
The horse generally
bolts about a quarter-
second before the
dazed man compre-
hends what has spiked
him. A prad with a
score of yellow-bellied
black-striped wasps
sinking their fire-tipped
fangs into his rump
bolts like a dozen
maddened fire-engines.
With lashing tail and
misfiring breath he
opens the throttle, then
streaks through t h. e
swishing bushes and
flies across gullies with-
out the slightest
thought of conse-
quences. The rider,
having to sustain two
simultaneous surprises,
not infrequently is
brushed off by the
first low-h a n g i n g
branches, and, hitting
the ground, bounces up
with waving arms to
outdistance the yellow
peril. Under this
stimulus more mara-
thon records have been
broken in the bush
than ever in the city.
The niggers have a
warm respect for wasps.
They approach the nest,
crawling, being very
careful to do nothing
to annoy the busy
inhabitants, and when
immediately underneath
it blow into flame a
bundle of ti-tree bark.
The cloud of thick
smoke protects the
nigger and bamboozles
the wasps. The buck
then grabs the comb-
like nest and makes his
escape. Sitting peace-
fully under cover, he grins, breaks open the comb,
and, picking out the tender larva;, ushers them
into their human sepulchre.

“Bad Australian” : The trouble about cook-
ing food which “Canar” (B. 29/10/’25) refers to
usually begins somewhere about 10,000 ft. above sea
level, increasing in a marked degree with altitude.
The next time he humps his swag above this mark
he should roast his bit of goat or pig meat. He
will find that easy enough; but if he must have his
provender boiled let him put a nigger or a fair-
sized geological specimen on the lid of the billy
while it boils, and the dinner will turn out to his
good content.

“Matrix” : Fiji, which years ago imported
the mongoose to wipe out its rat troubles, is now
indenting some feathered trifles who will lend a
friendly beak on the canefields. Five pairs of
mudlarks or peewits have been sent from Aus-
tralia, whilst Ceylon is to be searched for some
equally harmless birds. The peewit, a lover of
urban parts, carries most of its characteristics on
the right side of the ledger, and as an insect-
eater has few rivals. The lien lays from two to five

main drawback is that it builds its mud-plaster
home in exposed places, often on a horizontal limb,
°P en ,0 birds of prey and to small boys. The
birds move about mostly in batches of from two

or three to six or seven, though occasionally they

flock I have seen was at Rockhampton (Q.), a town
which takes its Bird Protection laws seriously. The
number strung out on the telephone wires one
summer sunset was -within easy approach of 300.
TEN-MILE WISDOM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
After walking ten miles a fool becomes wise.”
—Japanese proverb.
If any fool will walk with me
Ten miles along the track
When morning, in a wattle-tree,
Is laughing at his back.
I’ll bring him home with eyes to see
This country’s greater plan—
A land like God’s infinity,
Fit for the wiser man.
Ten miles of that ten thousand miles
That we might gaily go
Amid the plains or mountain piles
Or rivers singing low,
Where still the open wonder smiles
Of larger things and new,
Though never glimpse of homestead tiles
fie seen the bright world through!
If we should take a railway train
We'd see the best and worst,
The cultured fields, the growing grain,
The pathways trodden first,
And small far towns that die in pain
When mining fever cools,
Till we, perchance, returned again
As fools among the fools.
But make the journey heel and toe,
And use your open eyes
To grasp the fact that tracks may go
Far as the swallow flies
With ever something new to know
That grander years will use—
The wider fields your sons shall sow,
The wider ways to choose.
The little men have downed their tools,
The little tongues are loose ;■
Delay the stalwart’s ardor cools—
He murmurs “What’s the use?”
But here are found the larger schools
Of truth beneath the trees,
Where ten-mile wisdom teaches fools
To use their energies!

IN BOWLING CIRCLES varying statements are made from time to time in reference to
the effect heat has on the true playing of the various types of bowls Ebonite, Wood and
Composition used in Australasia. It has even been contended by interested parties that
Ebonite or Hard Rubber is not so suitable a material as wood for the construction of
bowls for the reason that rubber bowls, if left in the sun, soften to a certain extent and fail
to run true. It has also been stated that if the bowl is left in the sun for half an hour with
the bottom of the bowl resting on a wet patch of grass, a difference in the draw of from 1"
to 6" is noticeable.
In order to officially demonstrate that there was no foundation for such statements, tests were
carried out by an expert of the Melbourne University, on Mr. W. D. HenselPs Testing Table
in Melbourne.
The general method employed in the tests was to heat up one half of each bowl in a water
bath to a temperature equal to the highest sun temperature likely to be met with in practice.
The bowls were then quickly dried and run down the testing table. It was conclusively proved
that the Dunlop Ebonite Bowl was the least affected of all the kinds tried. The details of the tests
were as follows: —We illustrate at the foot hereof the path followed by the bowls during tests, “A”
being the point of release and “B” the finishing point.
The table had a slate bed, covered with flannellette, }i n rubber and canvas. Each of the
bowls tested, was run on the table, the length of run down the incline being in all cases such
that the bowls came to rest on the line “A. 8.” The distance of each from “B” was then
measured to the nearest half inch.
In the first test the following bowls were used:
1 Wooden Bowl 1 Brown Composition Bowl 2 Dunlop Ebonite Bowls
Test No, 1. The four bowls were placed
in water at 100°F. (the wooden bowl being
covered by a thin rubber bag) in such a way
that one half of the. bowl was immersed, this
half being the non-bias side of bowl, the other
half was exposed to atmospheric, temperature
at about 55° F. The water was then gradually
raised in temperature to 150° F., after which it
was allowed to cool slowly to 140° F. The
four bowls were then taken out and as quickly
as possible run along the testing table. The
following table gives results:
Distance from “B” along “A. 8.”
Test No. 2♦ Th e same bowls, and in
addition two more of wood and one of black
composition, were then half immersed in water
at 100° F., in the same way as before and the
temperature of the water was gradually raised
to 170° F., after which it was allowed to fall
slowly to 160° F., when the bowls were taken
out in turn and as quickly as possible tested
on the table. The appended table gives results:
Distance from “B” along “A. 8.”
In each case the figures given are the mean of at least two runs along the table, where the
length of run down the incline was such that the bowls came to rest on the line “A. 8.”
The results of the tests demonstrated that the Dunlop hard rubber bowls were very little
affected by their uneven heating, while there was an extraordinary variation in the case of two
of the wood bowls and the brown compound one, the departure from correctness being nearly a
yard. The figures show that very considerable differences are possible between bowls made of wood.

Nellie Stewart, looking a miracle of youth
in her green linen frock with prize oranges
growing profusely thereon, was queen of the
revels at the Stadium last week. It wasn’t
a prize fight she was gracing, though in-
directly it concerned a fight to a finish,
being a Bohemian carnival in aid of the T.B.
appeal. The Stadium was crowded, but not
with cauliflower-eared Genii of the Ring.
Nice girls bought and sold or intoned invoca-
tions around the whirring chocolate-wheel.
Every known character on the boards or on
the movies stepped down for a night and
mingled with the throng. The stalls were
ranged around the fighting arena, within
which the Police Band gaily prophesied “It
Ain’t Gonna Rain No More”; and less than
24 hours later every woman and man who
had hearkened to the deceiver was nearly
submerged in a realistic imitation of Niagara.
What we shall do with our girls need
trouble no mother these cabaret days. Even
as the hart panteth on the mountain tops
so the lasses pant for this form of entertain-
ment. The Ambassadors netted over 600 last
Thursday afternoon, and the building fund
for the Deaf and Dumb Hostel will benefit
by the gate money. Mrs. A. B. Shand, en-
thusiast in the cause of the people of Twi-
light land (as gentle Dowell O’Reilly called
them), skippered the function, and cleverly
catered for the mali-jongg and bridge fiend
as well as the jazzy sisterhood. Chief Justice
Street’s wife entertained one big group and
the Arthur Eedys another.
Last week the Maceabean Hall for the
second time this year revealed Tennyson’s
Dream of Fair Women. On this occasion
there was a completely new cast of ladies,
blonde and brune, buds of the oldest family
trees that grow on Sydney’s most expensive
Points; so Society buttoned up its mac. ruth-
lessly, loosed the family limousine from its
moorings and pointed its prow towards
Jewry’s headquarters in Darlinghurst. Here
all was bright lights and toothful smiles and
purry raiment. Funnily enough, considering
the wetness of the night, one of the first
tableaux was of Moses in the bulrushes.
Beauteous in this was Dr. Eakin’s lady as
Pharaoh’s Daughter, with Rosemary McKay's
Miriam as second lead —Moses apparently
got stage fright and remained behind the
river’s brim. Mrs. John Faviel (who was
Audrey Pickburn) occurred in an illustration
from Ruth and Naomi; and in the Dream
Donne Waldron’s exotic Cleopatra and Moira
Brady’s Iphigenia in her sea-foam draperies
were a sound argument on the evils of in-
somnia. Donne Waldron, who has ambitions
towards movie stardom, seems to have
snatched a heritage of play-talent from her
father. Two one-aeters, “Between the Soup
and the Savory” and “A Seat in the Park,”
were notable for the work done in the first
by Mrs. Hector Clayton and in the second
by Shirley Bavin. The whole flared into one
last wild turn called “Jazz You Like It,”
in which everybody who had already taken
part and many who hadn’t appeared as a
character from a comic-opera or musical-
comedy success. Pat Levy’s jazz band sup-
plied the mad music, and later on there was
a supper dance in the lower hall. Mrs.
David Cohen and Gwen Marks and Sylvia
Purves are smiling over the success.
The feet that danced at the Palais one
night last week went proudly shod. Cinder-
ella in her glass slippers) was not more glit-
tersome about the tootsies than the maids
and matrons who tore a hole in the jazz at
the Combined Shoe Trades Ball. Since no-
body is allowed to be gay in Sydney unless
in the name of Charity (trust the hospital
organisers for that!), the shoe trade swung
a tireless slipper in the interests of the Royal
Alexandra Hospital for Children. Not only
does it wish to maintain the cot it has already
endowed in the Camperdown institution, but
it desires to spread the good work and
endow another cot. A strictly male com-
mittee kept the flag flying.
The sale of poppies on Armistice Day will
bring almost £5OOO to the Returned Soldiers’
fund. Among city workers actress Ailsa
Grahame lifted the heaviest swag—her total
was £B6. But Mrs. Quick ran her close with
£B3. Mosman, of course, held her head
higher than the other suburbs, and dropped
£250 into the bag.
The movement now on foot to establish a
convalescent home in the Blue Mountains
for shop-assistants is something of an echo
of the idea Mark Foy had a good many
years ago when he furnished a house at Med-
low for the benefit of his own staff. The home
is to be at Warrimoo, and Arthur Rickard
has given the land. The building will cost
about £7OOO, and upkeep will run into two
or three thousand a year. This the shop-
assistants (there are over 10,000 of them in
N. S. Wales) will themselves provide by
contributing a penny or twopence a week.
Dagmar Thomson’s recital filled the Con.
seats with the best frocking—and the best
line of musical ears, too —one warm night
last week. This was the violinist’s third con-
cert since her return from Europe, and at
each she has presented a work new to Syd-
ney. This time it was a sonata of Edward
Moeran, one of the new British writers.
Frank Hutchens looked after the piano end
of the work, as he did in the Wieniawski
concerts, and the two artists portrayed the
subtleties of keening emotion and light-
hearted gaiety with which the work is filled.
Basso Arthur Benham added the charms of
Schubert to the programme.
How many are there left who can claim
to have been guests of Burdekin House in
the days when the beautiful Mrs. Burdekin
hostessed there? The founder of the estab-
lishment probably dreamed of the cedar stair-
case lasting out four generations of Burde-
kin ; but for years now the house has turned
a shuttered front to Macquarie-street, and
the other day the Conquest of Old Sydney
went still farther, and Burdekin House be-
came a tea-and-toast shop. It is to be run
in the interests of the Royal Prince Alfred
Hospital, who pay the new owner, T. E.
Rofe, a nominal rental of a shilling a week’
and tea-dances and amateur theatricals are
to rage in the old ballroom. Mrs. Arthur
Scrivener is president of the committee in
charge.
The gastric juices were kept in brisk action
at the Wentworth the other night by a
flicker-drama that might be said to have
solved the secret of perpetual motion. “Paths
to Paradise” was its name—a sort of tongue-
in-the-cheek crook yarn in which a stolen
diamond necklet, detectives and reformed bag-
snatchers are wildly mixed up. The jazzers
liked the innovation. It was over by 9.30,
and after that it was on with the dance in
tlie usual way. Two new dancers, Zeida and
John Juan, gave an exhibition of footcraft
from the Riviera.
Edna Thomas, back at the Conservatorium,
is dressed in the Louisiana fashions in vogue
before America’s civil war. In a skirt so
thickly patterned in green it might be mis-
taken for the Spreading Chestnut-tree, she
reaped applause and many flowers on Satur-
day night. Not flower-shop bouquets these,
but great bunches of blooms straight from
garden plots. The accompanist had an un-
conscious act of her own. Dressed in the
crinoline of the period, every time she frisked
across the stage she displayed a length of
giddy little pantalette, and every time the
pantalette peeped the audience applauded.
The girl harpist made heavenly sounds.
This little lady isn’t a sword-eater, but she
is one of the cleverest fencers that teacher
Frank Stuart has had in his school of
swordsmanship. A slip of a schoolgirl, this
Elaine Proctor
can lunge and
parry like an
expert. She
holds the
ch am pionship
of the big Wil-
-1 i a m - street
fencing school,
and is such a
brilliant all-
round sports-
girl that she is
rapidly quali-
fying for a
position among
the leading
sports coaches
of Sydney. Mr.
Stuart looks
forward to as
great a suc-
cess for Elaine
as Edith Gil-
lespie, the champion swordswoman of the
State, has achieved. Edith has just covered
herself with laurels in the Hutton Memorial
contests, and no less a personage than Felix
Grave, the knut of the foils world, has de-
clared that she may, with a little more prac-
tice, easily become the leading swordswoman
of Europe. May Moore made the picture.
A note from “A.G.M.” in London :
Melba has sold her bouse in Mansfield-street, and,
by way of farewell, gave an afternoon party there
on October 13. In the gold-and-grey drawing-room
into which the painted panels from her old home
in Great Cumberland-place had been set, the Diva
sang airs by Mozart, Verdi and Bemberg to a com-
pany which included the Timothy Coghlans, Lady
Loughborough, Lady Susan Birch and Lord Dicky
Nevill. After that she went south and sang at a
carnival in Venice. There will be a stay on the
Riviera, and then she returns to Britain for a
“farewell” provincial tour.
It is not so many years since Dr. Edward
Charles Egan, who owns a practice in the
picturesque little town of Nimbin, attended
University lectures. In the middle of last
week he qualified for curtain lectures-—if
ever he deserves them —for he took to wife
Norma Ryan, elder daughter of the popular
.T. A. Ryans, of Waverley. The ceremony
took place at the Church of the Immaculate
Conception, where not two decades ago the
bride was christened. It looked like a hitch
when the lights failed just as the guests
assembled, but after 20 minutes the current
declared the strike off, and lit up a vision
of tall, slim, youthful loveliness, clad in
ivory crepe meteor, glistening with crystals
and encrusted with pearls. A veil of Lim-
erick lace covered a dark waved shingle, and
her train of pink and white tulle looked like
a stray cloud. Pretty sister Sheila and
cousin Claire O’Reilly completed the trio.
The ’groom had PI. McCarthy and Frank
Meacle to sustain him during the dark 20
minutes of waiting. The bride’s aunt,
Marie Narclle, lifted her voice to bring-
down a blessing on the newly-wedded pair as
they signed up.
This sunny face is the one Wynne Whear
Roberts turns

day. But a t
night she is

second face to
turn to th e
world. In
short, she is
a n amateur
actress of such
cleverness that
her face actu-
becomes a
part of tbe
character she
is personating.
One of the
arriving Play-
boxers, she has
done some
striking work
in the little
theatre in Rowe-street. Notably her Mayor-
ess in the gay and philosophic “Lord Mayor"
by McNulty. Her father, the late Whear
Roberts, was one of The Bulletin’s oldest
contributors. The picture is one of May
Moore’s.
Lewis Hamilton, of Ravenswood, Ryl-
stone, whose father was the late James
Hamilton, of Victoria, has just secured the
promise true of Cris Macfarlane, of Teviot,
Darling Point. Her father is Donald Mac-
farlane, knowm as the Corriedale king in the
Mudgee district.
Just back from Europe, Tootles William-
son put a thrill into the Godhai'rd party the
other afternoon by blushingly announcing
her engagement to Wallace Horsley, of Yab-
tree station.
Ex-M.L.A, Orchard had a Saturday after-
noon job last week-end at St. Stephen’s,
w 7 here he gave daughter Jessie Alicia in
matrimony to old Randwick boy John
Norman Lawson, now 7 of Kidgery, Nyngan.
Jessie Alicia, w 7 ho in flapper days threatened
to be a political person, showed a pretty taste
in wedding raiment, and was ivory satin-
bound, with tulle embellishments. Sister Ida
and Eileen, sister of the groom, ’maided in
georgettes blue as the afternoon skies and
Dolly Varden hats on wdiich pink roses
smiled. St. Stephen’s had got itself up with
pink and white posies, and Renee Maxwell
breathed a Song of Thanksgiving over the
assemblage. Later on bride’s mother and
father spread the meats at the Mary Eliza-
beth. *| ,•
A pretty bride of the week w r as Kitty
Edwards, who came in rosy tulles from Kil-
lara to St. Philip’s to let Canon Belling-
ham unite her to Ronnie Edwards, of the
same suburb.
Comte I. de Galembert, Administrator of
the French Civil Service of lndo-China, with
his countess and her sister, Mdlle. Frezouls,
has been in Australia for a few 7 weeks, after
touring Maoriland. Even the French com-
munity found them too elusive to entertain;
they are too interested in seeing the country
to spare time for social amenities. They
leave by the Runic (strike permitting) to
follow 7 their itinerary—S’Afrxca, Madagas-
car, French Coast of Somaliland, then Paris.
The Count is enjoying leave, but is combining
it w 7 ith a mission for France’s Minister of
Colonies.
Mrs. Alex. Joske is wearing the most con-
tented smile her face has knowm for nearly
three years. Her tall, good-looking Nell is
back again from a tour of the world. While
iu London she studied dramatic art at the
Royal Academy. En route for Sydney she
stayed awhile with brother Clive in Suvm,
where that erstwhile airman manages the
firm of Brown and Joske and performs
French Consular duties.
The A. C. Godhards gave the home-again
hand-clasp to a hundred of their friends at
the Australia last week. The drawing-room,
pink roses in its hair, was very festive, and
the hostess was a picture swathed in Floren-
tine lace of the new cocoa shade, its drapings
caught at one side with a diamond clasp.
Notable addenda were liand-painted satin
shoes in the same shade and short gloves
turned back at the wrists to show a cherry
lining. Mother (Mrs. H. E. Bullock)
helped to keep the good cheer flowing, and
had the support of vellum satins and black
lace. Tootles Williamson, in a pert red hat,
whispered of her new engagement; bridge-
builder Ennis’s wife brought a lusciously
embroidered black satin, and so did Mrs.
Herbert Nelson. In fact, perhaps because
the sky was dour and waspish, black was
the favorite wear. Among the guests were
the matron of the Crown-street Womens
Hospital and the new secretary, May Shee-
han ; and Sister Kerven and George Fitz-
patrick’s wife might be said to represent the
rival baby-hospital of St. Margaret’s.
.Tust three months ago Eileen Tilley,
youngest daughter of the William Tilleys,
became Mrs. R. E. Fisher, and a week or so
later she and her new husband sailed for
their English home, intending to spend a
month or two in India on the way. They had
just about finished their travels and had
come down to Calcutta when the bride fell
sick of what seemed to be fever, biit in a
few hours was followed by peritonitis; and
the cables that told of sickness were swiftly
followed by one that told of death. r I wo
terribly stricken parents and daughter In a
will leave on a pilgrimage to the grave at
Calcutta on Saturday.
Miss Brisbane’s sheaf: —
The Wintergarden was lent by the Carrolls, Eddie
Horton gave his services at the organ, and all went
merry as it might have done for an imported film
at the private screening of that genuine Aussie
work, “The Moth of Moonbi” film, which Charlie
Chauvel is giving to the world. Scenes from old
Franklyn Vale station, from Koorallyn, at Fitzroy
Vale, and Alan Chauvel’s home at Suinmerlands, the
Spicer’s Gap-road and about Brisbane are worked
into the story, founded on Mrs. Forrest’s novel,
“The Wild Moth.” Keg Atthow, the champion
cattle-drafter, and the well-known buckjumper Light -
nin’ supply some of the country color, and Joan
Bond, Irma Dearden and other of our naicest deco-
rate the city scenes.
For bride-elect Amy Hall, Mrs. William Buleoek
had a party at Lennon’s, amongst palms and roses.
The guest of honor, in white, with a coral-pink
hat, got an envelope bag in mastic and a basket
of red roses. Mrs. Bulcock wore Paris-tinted mari-
ette over jade, and a gold-brown hat, and pretty
daughter Bebe topped rose and white with a white
hat.
Authors and artists met at the Women’s Club
amidst roses and gerberas to discuss the Australian
novel. Nice things were said of A. H. Chisholm’s
collection of E. J. Banfield’s “Last Leaves from
Dunk Island,” and Dr. Cumbrae Stewart mentioned
that Phcebe Eirwan and J. H. Hartt’s book of
photographs and prose would be ready soon. Merna
Gillies arranged the music, to which Jean Mactag-
gart, M. Barry, A. G. Stark and Mary Sydes con-
tributed.
Isobel Bond, daughter of George Bond, Bodelwyn,
Hamilton, took John Whatmore, the G. W. What-
mores’ son, for better and worse in St. Paul’s,
and did it in white satin, Brussels lace and a sheaf
of water-lilies. Jacaranda color decked Joan Bond,
Grace Whatmore, Freda Stewart and Nancy Hicks,
who ’maided. Alan Mansfield best-manned.
Mayoress Jolly and Miss Bingham (who is leav-
ing for the Cold Country) were guests at the
Women’s Club in a background of red gerberas and
fern. President Harris said the club was proud
to entertain the first mayoress of the world’s biggest
municipality. Mrs. Jolly, in beige and cherry,
thanked the president ; Miss Bingham did the same
in cream crepe de Chine. Mabel Zillman saw to
the musical menu.
Merle Weaver, who takes over the headship of
the girls’ school at Ballina, was feted by the Lyceum
clubites. Jean White-Haney, in moonlight blue,
presided.
The Arts and Crafts Exhibition has been largely
visited this year, and makes an excellent display.
Mrs. Tweedie poured a cup or two to visitors on
the 20th.
Queensland, under Labor rule, needs a Lord Cham-
berlain to settle the order of precedence of its
ladies. One (unofficial) authority recently laid it
down that, Governor Nathan being a bachelor, the
first lady of the land was the wife of the Chief
Justice; but the Labor ladies are not disposed to
accept that ruling. They contend that the “Pre-
mieress” should come first. Then there are two
“ex-Premieresses” (Mrs. E. G. Theodore and Mrs.
T. J. Ryan) who are still prominent socially; also
the widow of the late Chief Justice. The wives of
the Ministers, of course, take the rank of their
respective husbands, as determined by Caucus. That’s
simple enough; but does Mrs. Alderman come before
or after Mrs. Under-Secretary, and what is the
relative importance of the wife of a union secre-
tary and the wife of the head of an A.L.P. branch?
These be vexed questions.

THE 1925 MECCANO
Better fan than ever this year t
The reason so many boys go in for Meccano model-building nowadays is that the
models are real engineering structures in miniature. They work like the real thing
because every Meccano part—Girders, Strips, Gear-wheels, etc.—are all real engineer-
ing parts. And every model you build is strong and sturdy because it is built of
steel. Meccano parts are made of steel and brass, and if you can use a spanner and
a screwdriver that’s all you want. Full instructions are contained in every Outfit and
you’ll find Meccano model-building ever so easy!
If you haven’t a Meccano Outfit see that you get one this Christmas. Talk to
Dad about it to-night.
Any Toy Shop will Show you a Meccano Outfit or'yet one
for you.
MECCANO OUTFITS from 5/- to 540/-
The Magic Carpet is the name of a fine boot
we will send you free. Send a postcard giving
your name and address, and the book comes

your name for reference. When you receive

Although Melbourne was wilting, English
Speakers rolled up in force at No. 9 Darling-
street to say their “pleased you came” to
the G.-G. and Lady Stonehaven. Her Ex.,
with some white tulle upon black-lace drap-
eries, was handed the customary vegetation,
and Lord Stonehaven said flattering things
of the union in return for president Donald
Mackinnon’s reminiscent address of welcome.
Mayor Brunton and his lady, she in a, black
velvet embossed gown; Mrs. W. A. Watt,
who came in pearl-embroidered gold-liued
crepe satin ; the Best dame and Mrs. Donald
Mackinnon; Mrs. Harold Clapp, with fur
touching up Oriental red georgette; Mrs.
Corrie Gardner and Mrs. Herbert Brookes
were some of - the executive. Mrs. Richard
Gipps, wife of the E.S.U. sec., wore smart
covering of floral sprigged taffetas, and Mrs.
R. Pitcher had some lovely bead traceries
upon grey georgette.
“The Farmers’ Wife” —no relation of the
lady of the carving-knife—had a hilarious
premiere at the Theatre Royal. The Eng-
lish countryside did not permit of modern
furnishing or frocking; but Applegarth Farm
had a cheery living-room with pretty chintz
hangings, red geraniums in window-boxes and
some chairs upon which collectors east long-
ing eyes. The sitting-room of spinster Tliirza
Tapper's villa, with its red velvet uphol-
stery, antimacassars and framed models of
a ship and a fish, was an antiquarian’s
dream, and even the frocking bore the im-
print of the corner store and little country
dressmaker. Thirza’s (Susan Richmond’s)
reception gown of fuchsia hue, with high
collar and sleeves of lace, murmured of
maidenly dignity. Doris Johnstone, the good-
looking leading lady, wore the pink zephyr
and muslin apron of servitude, until, as the
farmer’s prospective second wife, she donned
cherry-red flounced frocking with muslin
fichu.
Melbourne Music Club was responsible for
the best bit of instrumental work heard in
Melbourne for months at the Vic. Artists’
Galleries when Louise Gargurevicli and Mrs.
Arthur Streeton presented Vincent d’lndy’s
Sonata for pianoforte and violin. Louise,
with beaten gold embellishment upon white
gowning, joined youth, heaps of talent and a
fine sense of rhythm and accent to the
matured fiddling of Mrs. Streeton, who first
made Australian audiences’ acquaintance as
Nora Clench, assisting artist with Albani.
She was an attractive, graceful figure iu
flowing draperies of black georgette allied to
silver and black brocade. The pianist gained
further well-merited laurels in the colorful
Concerto of Glazouuow, to which Henry Spry
added a second keyboard part in lieu of
orchestra. Artist Arthur Streeton lent a
proud ear to his wife’s performance.
Feminine ratepayers and the womenfolk of
aldermen and councillors murmured “Two
lumps” or “No sugar” to the accompani-
ment of a string orchestra’s “I want to be
happy” when Mrs. G. W. Simpson, Haw-
thorn’s chief civic lady, held her first recep-
tion the other day at the local Town Hall.
Masses of beautiful foliage plants sprouted
in the window-boxes arranged by Curator
Barnard of the Hawthorn Gardens. The
hostess, in an ensemble suit and a black hat,
was supported by daughters Dora and Emily,
who exhibited pretty frocks of bois’-de-rose
and delphiniiim-blue, topped by black crin.
millinery.
An interested first-nighter at “The Farm-
er’s Wife” was Harriet Bennett, the bonnie
young lead who had just arrived for some
of the Firm’s new musical productions. She
comes of a family of singers, and is expected
to make a stir.
Brighton jazzed in aid of St. Vincent’s
appeal at the local Town Hall one night
last week. Mayoress Mrs. Walter E. Briggs,
who helped along the frivol, wore draperies
of fawn georgette with glistening embroidery.
Mrs. R. J. Dunlea and Mrs. A. de Brigny
were the secretaries, the former in a beaded
floral design upon petunia pink crepe
Romaine, the other in a beaded gown of
lavender hue.
Melbourne the past week has been haunted
by well-laundered elderly gentlemen in Lewis
and Whitty coats, check trousers and green-
faced white sports hats. They are the visit-
ing demonstrators of the ancient game of
bowls, come from Britain to pit their powers
against local opponents. The hospitality
extended the strangers almost wrecked their
skill, and they departed to Sydney literally
singing Melbourne’s praises.
The programme of the British Music
Society’s gathering of Friday night suffered
from insufficient mastication, and although
the works were interesting they weren’t
remarkably melodic. However, some com-
pensation arrived when Mrs. Alberto
Zelman, in glistening black, sang a trio of
rondels arranged to a unique accompaniment
of strings by Vaughan Williams. Of the
audience were Mr. and Mrs. Jimmy Dyer,
Dr. and Mrs. Douglas Stewart, Alice Rich-
ardson, J. Sutton Crow and Dr. and Mrs.
Rudall.
Some little time ago Mrs. McCubbin,
widow of the late artist, conceived the pro-
ject of providing meals for hungry citizens.
Before putting out her sign she examined
all the chances, and finding them roseate, will
open the doors of the Cafe Julian—the
name sounds comfy and Bohemian—on the
JOth of this month. Its location is the old
Sux office in Flinders-street. With Mrs.
McCubbin in her venture is Mrs. Hender-
son, whose late husband was Income-tax
Commissioner for the State.
The rift in the lute of the Vic. Artists’
Society gaped officially the other day when
the resignation of president John Longstaff
was announced, though a new head had been
elected a couple of Aveeks ago. Violation of
old-time rules vyliicli allowed the full council
to be the selection committee is the founda-
tion of the trouble. With the election of
the well-known portrait-painter, the council
Avas sorted out and a special body of cen-
sors formed. It only got a chance of using
its powers drastically once—for the autumn
show; but the old order returned with the
lately-concluded exhibition, and all did “the
picking,” the then president, who was absent,
being represented by a deputy. There are
rumors of more resignations, and mahl-sticks
will be broken on palettes before the dispute
is settled.
Mrs. Osborne, who went to Amsterdam
last August to represent the Federal and
Victorian Governments at a congress in
Amsterdam on industrial accidents and dis-
eases, is coming home for Christmas. Pro-
fessor of Physiology Osborne and five little
Osbornes will be Avaiting on the wharf. Mrs.
Osborne is a master of science, bachelor of
medicine and bachelor of surgery, and a
prodigious worker.
I-lelga Sudholz has handed to the Alfred
Hospital _ committee her wonderful supper-
cloth which gained so much admiration at
the recent R.A. Show. Valued by herself
at £6O, it has been priced by Art experts
at £lOO, and should bring in a fine cheque
if raffled. Miss Sudholz owes her profi-
ciency in what is known as “fancy-work” to
some years of ill health; she tried every kind
of _ needlecraft to pass weary hours. ' Now
quite well, she is giving her beautiful cloth,
representing months of industry, as a sort
of thank-offering, though she was not a
patient of the hospital.
Mrs. George Bell, the good-looking origi-
nal of this Lafayette picture, has added to
her histrionic
triumphs by
her charming
portrait of
Mrs. Lincoln
in the Mel-
bourne Reper-
tory’s just-
concluded sea-
son of John
D rinkwater’s
play, “Abra-
ham Lincoln.”
The lady, who
has had much
experience in
amateur theat-
ricals, is the
wife of artist
George Bell,
president of
the Austra-
lian Art x\sso-
ciation.
Lady Stonehaven, in a black gown beneath
a black-and-gold brocaded wrap, attended the
concert at the Auditorium when Bernard
Heinze steered the Uui. orchestra through
Cesar Franck’s great symphony. The audi-
ence was somewhat sparse; of the usual
patrons )vere the Miller dame, knight James
Barrett and his lady, the Creswell dame,
Mrs. Albert Miller, the Jimmy Dyers and
Mrs. Herbert Brookes.
There were crimson roses about the draw-
ing-room and more dolling up the cakes and
scom-s when Mrs. J. H. Keating invited some
friends to meet Pauline Curran and her
fiance, Prince Melikoff. The bride-elect wore
wood-brown georgette and chiffon velvet in
two-piece mode, with trimming of Belgian
hare, and a swathed toque. Black crepe
satin witli a flared flounce and flower-decked
ivory crin. millinery were worn by the host-
ess, whose daughter Tulla sheathed a wil-
lowy figure in pink and blue-shaded jersey
silk. Of the partied were the Quick lady,
Mrs. Carty Salmon, Miss Monks, James Con-
noily’s pretty lass Cassie, _ the Ilennessy
dame and daughter Sylvia, Mrs. Brodie
Ainslie, Mrs. Ivan Gutmann, Mrs. I. Mc-
inerney and her daughter. _ Some members
of the sterner sex strayed in shepherded by
ex-Scnator Keating.
St. Pat.’s Society is talking of selling the
historic hall in Bourke-street, where the first
Legislative Council sat after the separation
of Port Phillip district from N. S. Wales
and before the institution of responsible
government. The upkeep of the building is
a bit too much for the society, and the pro-
perty should realise a good price. The lower
hall was for years the meeting-place of the
C.Y.M. Society—a literary and debating or-
ganisation which developed a heap of talent
and trained scores for service on public and
semi-public bodies. Before the hall is de-
molished there will be a reunion—or wake,
some of the old hands suggest.
This thoughtful lass is Nora Colstad, who
under the guidance of Benno Scherek pro-
mises to join
A ustr alia’s
brightest stars
of the piano.
She hails from
Westralia, her
dad, Captain
Colstad, who

section, being

ai o n wealth

vi c e there.

Of his family of three, Nora is the only
pianist. Lafayette made the picture.
Ola Cohn's sculpture, etchings by Jessie
Traill and G. A. Soilleux and water-colors
by F. G. Reynolds make up a show at the
Queen's Hall which was sent smiling on its
way by Frank Tate the other afternoon. The
Director of Education massaged his Depart-
ment’s spine by pointing out that Ola
Cohn was one of its distinguished students,
having graduated from Bendigo Art School.
Mr. Reynolds, like Ola Cohn, was a former
student of the Education Department, but he
began with agriculture. Jessie Traill is do-
ing well abroad, and G. A. Soilleux combines
architecture and etching. Business promised
well, with the keenest competition to secure
Ola Cohn’s quaint little figure studies.
The medical profession formed a whole
A.M.C. battalion at a bridge-cim-jazz at the
Brenan Hall for out-patients of St. Vincent’s
Hospital. A deluge of rain followed a blis-
tering day, but folk turned up in their pret-
tiest, no doubt in thanksgiving for the
change; and the organisers—Mrs. W. R. Bur-
ston, Mrs. F. Blackball, Miss Celia O’Donnell
and other members of the Past Nurses’ Asso-
ciation of the hospital—will be able to hand
over about £l5O towards the institution’s big
appeal.
Women Royal Autoists sped to the club
one afternoon last week to pass the cup in
honor of Mrs. E. W. Cox, wife of the presi-
dent. The stage-managers were Mrs. C.
Hooper, in a gown of powder-blue; Mrs.
Frankel, in navy georgette ; and Miss Myra
Marsh, whose black frock was beaded. The
leading lady found a silver card-tray lurking-
in the presentation posy of pink carnations.
Mrs. A. T. Ham, of Melbourne’s leading
tea-rendezvous, the Wattle, followed an
annual habit when on one recent night she
handed over the establishment, with its gold,
red, orange and black setting, and the below-
stairs palm court, for a hop and bridge in
aid of the Women’s Hospital. St. Vincent's
benefited last year; the Alfred will say thank
you next.
May Cox, the Education Department’s
organiser of swimming, and during the war
the officer chiefly responsible for the Depart-
ment’s enormously successful patriotic fund,
collapsed when the rush of maimed Diggers
seeking and finding temporary relief tapered
off. A trip to the Cold Country set her up
again; but she returned to work only to
break an ankle. A brief time off duty was
followed by her re-appearance on crutches
to look after her swimmers, and things have
gone so well that another fortnight' should
see the winsome lady diving once more from
the highest springboard she can find.
Dr. and Mrs. Barry Thomson’s only child.
Jack, is to take up a theatrical career, and
at present is reporting progress from Lon-
don, where he is studying the dramatic art
under Kenneth Barnes, a brother of Irene
Vanbrugh. Mrs. Thomson is the first of the
family to lean stagewards; she has a part in
“Jewelled Nights,’’ the new Louise Lovely
movie.
New Norfolk, the little hamlet on the Der-
went, famous for its hopfields, is preening
itself on the honor just conferred on Mrs.
G, A. Matheson, principal of its School of
Art, who has been made a Fellow of the \ ic-
toria College of Music (Lond.). She is the
Speck’s first Fellow of that College, and, so
they say, the first woman Fellow in Aus-
tralia.
There is a move to again popularise long
white gloves for evening wear. At Govern-
ment House during Cup week the lengthy kid
coverings were much seen. Fans, too —silk,
satin and exquisite French silk laces with
decorative handles—have leapt from cedar
chest or glory-box of the late-Victorian
period. At the E.S.U. reception to the
Stonehavens these pretty extras made a
goodly showing over many a modish gown.
Pretty raiment was displayed at the
nuptials of Myfawny Eileen Dixon and Allen
John Roark, a popular member of Mel-
bourne’s Stock Exchange. The bride, who
is the youngest daughter of the John Dixons
of Mentone, scintillated in diamente and crys-
tal beads upon white georgette and silver
lame with white tulle falling from a pearl
head-dress. Her three attendant sprites
sported muffs of real roses and tulle against
dawn-pink and silver. The splendor was
removed to the Oriental afterwards.
Time seems not to wither the lure of
bridge. No less than 62 tables were re-
served at the Women’s Automobile Club
rooms when the Melbourne Hospital Social
Service benefited by the playing. Sales of
flowers and sweets added a bit extra to help
on the good work of this Red Cross auxiliary,
whose job is to regularly convey, per com-
fortably fitted car, ex-patients who still re-
quire treatment at the hospital. The honors
of the afternoon’s success were shared by
many. Mrs. IT. I. Cohen and Mrs. Robert
Hunter directed the card-tables, and Mrs.
E. A. Evans headed the afternoon-tea bat-
talion ; Mrs. G. C. Scantlebury had the blos-
soms stall, and Mrs. Jack Hogan was leader
of the lolly brigands.
Sister Adelaide’s innings:—
Much tea has been stirred in honor of visiting
notables. The A. E-. V. Richardsons brewed some
for Clara Butt, and Mrs. Glover, as representative
of the E.S.U., brewed more for Lee White. Mr.
McEwin was the Union’s spoksman at the latter
party, where Lee White proclaimed herself no
speech-maker and put her thanks into a delightful
song or two. The Butt parties struck the climax
of a heat-wave and the depths of an arctic change
—the former minimised by the large, cool rooms at
Urrbrae and a mass of flowers that looked as
though they’d never felt a hot wind. The Aussenac
frocks (she, by the way, is a friend of Lady
Bridges, and is to stay at Government House as
soon as the Ormonde returns us our wandering vice-
regals) are as short as the Butt ones are long,
but delicate and charming as their wearer’s playing.
There has been a change of presidents at the
Children’s Hospital and Mr. Glover has been voted
to the chair C. H. Angas quitted—he is off to
the Cold Land. The Angases have been sturdy
pillars of the hospital, whereof as witnesses the
Angas wing and the gardener’s and caretaker’s
cottages.
The engagement is announced of Mavis, eldest
daughter of the Claude de N. Lucases, of Anlaby,
Kapunda (she is one of the prettiest of our younger
set), to Leslie, second of the David Shannon sons
of the same district.
There was a minor casualty at Birkalla on Satur-
day a fall that cost Dan Cudmore a damaged
elbow and will put a temporary stop to his polo-
playing. Likewise there was an afternoon of blaz-
ing heat, and few men were more popular than
E. S. Patterson, who hosted the afternoon tea.
Lookers-on included the George Braunds, just back
from England.
The memorial portrait of Harry Butler has been
added to the historical section of the Art Gallery,
and the £4 0 surplus is to be divided between the
Limbless and Blinded Soldiers’ Associations a
decision that none would so heartily endorse as the
gallant flying man.
The Con.’s latest fledgling is an operatic class
which came into existence under Clive Carey’s fairy
wand at the beginning of the year and made its
first bow in Purcell’s “Dido and /Eneas” and a scene
from Mozart’s “Magic Flute” at the Norwood Town
Hall. It gave an excellent account of itself, especially
in orchestration and chorus, and of the principals
a special word is due to the Dido of Valda Harvey
and the Papageno of Gerald Moyse.
While the funds for the benefit of soldiers in
Melbourne and Sydney are exhausted, and appeals
are made for aid for distressed Diggers from time
to time, and while Brisbane occasionally appeals
for left-off clothing, the S.A. soldiers’ fund distri-
butes £30,000 yearly without asking the public
for help. This is a credit to Adelaide’s municipal
ability, as the local fund was started and is largely
run by members and ex-members of the Adelaide
City Council, with ex-Mayor Alan Simpson as the
mainspring.
The Adelaide City Council goes back this year
without an election; the only new councillors will
be motorbody-builder Ted Holden and lawyer Charlie
Jessop. The retiring members are Malcolm Reid, a
veteran septuagenarian, and John Entwistle, the
founder of the S.A. Country Party’.
Dr. Postle, who with his wife worked up our
Presbyterian Girls’ School to a high place, has re-
signed, and the headship is to be taken by a woman.
She is Isobel Macdonald, who, after taking high
honors at Melbourne Uni., was a teacher at the
P.L.C. in that village, had six years as head of
St. Cuthbert’s, in Auckland, and is at present in
England studying the latest methods in pedagogy.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Valais horses were conspicuous at Warwick
Farm (N.S.W.) on Saturday. Gulgong (5 to 2 on),
who has been very successful since he entered W.
Kelso’s stable, beat three commoners in the Home-
bush Handicap, 11 furlongs; Valparaiso (15’s)
cleared right away from a big field in the Nursery
Handicap, and Valicare (5 to 2) scored an equally
hollow victory in the first division of the Farm
Stakes, six furlongs, Valicare is a three-year-old
sister to Lausanne, who was third in the last
Newmarket and favorite for the Doncaster Handi-
cap, and it is to be hoped she will turn out
more trustworthy than her brother ; certainly she lias
plenty of pace. Valparaiso is a gelded brother to
the Doncaster winner, Fuji San, and is a very
promising youngster indeed. In fact the Sydney
two-year-old form is above the average this year.
Rampion, Ivanooka and Valparaiso are good, and
another baby that may turn out well is Kelgoola,
a gelded brother to Easingwold, who showed fine
speed in a handicap at Canterbury Park, though he
ran all over the track. He is engaged in a race at
Rosehill on Saturday, and though still pretty green
should be worth a small tote bet if he starts.
* * * *
Fields were fairly large at Epsom (Vic.)
on Saturday, but many of the starters were just down-
the-line prads, and the down-the-line prad is a poor
old thing. Backers held their own with McShortodds,
as three first favorites were successful. The Epsom
Handicap, 10 furlongs, for which old Pluto was first
choice, was w’on by Lady Warwick (Kenilworth —
Cena), with Ouragan and Reputed King in the
places. Lady Warwick, a fair sort of mare, was
backed down to 5 to 1; she is trained by Dick
Bradfield, who owns portion of her hide. Trillo,
who had run second to Red Gauntlet in the High-
weight Handicap at Flemington on Cup day, was
made a hot favorite at 5 to 4 for the Open Handi-
cap, six furlongs, and won as he liked from Flying
Princess and Amber Ale. Duncan, who is coming
back to form, had the mount.
“Samuel Surething”: There were so many de-
mands for Pluto in the betting on the Epsom Handi-
cap that bookmakers who had laid the gelding freely
at a couple of points longer than his 7 to 2 closing
price refused to go on with him. I had just been
denied accommodation by one particular hero when
an unsophisticated-looking youth pushed past me.
“Wot’s Pluto?” he asked. “No money,” replied
McShortodds tersely, and looked for other customers.
Instantly the youth’s manner changed. “Well, wot
the blazes y’ doin’ down ’ere with a blanky big
bag round y’ neck,” he shouted, “if y’ got no
money ?”
* * * *
“S. Gumm”: So Dr. Argyle, author of
the Vic. Totalisator Bill, “aims at securing a
better machine than any in the other States” (B.
19/11/’25). 1 don’t think the doctor can improve
on the Westralian example, except in the direction
of adding a double-event implement, as in S’Africa.
On Westralian courses there are straightout and
place totes, first, second and third drawing the
same percentage on the place machine; lus. is
the minimum stake in the grandstand and ss. in
the leger reserve. The beauty of this arrangement
is that the small punter who bets 10s. (or 65.)
each way can generally show a profit if his horse
runs into a place, unless he backs a hot favorite
in a small field. By contrast, 10s. each way on
a placed horse at Kandwick, where there is no
straightout tote and the existing machine is a
fool of a thing, nearly always results in a loss.
Second or third horses rarely pay evens on Sydney
totes unless they are rank outsiders; at Warwick
Farm on Saturday a 7-to-2 shot returned 9s. 6d.
for 10s., a 5-to-l chance paid 11s. 6d., and a
horse which started at 10’s in a field of 17 yielded
a whole 17s. 6d. for third. Compare these pre-
posterous prices with some of those declared on the
10s. grandstand totes at the last W.A.T.C. meeting in
Perth. Floramour, winner of the Urove Handicap,
paid £l6 Bs. on the s.o. tote and 40s. on the
place machine; her closing price with the book-
makers was 10 to 1. Maple’s dividends in the
Juvenile Handicap were £ll 18s. s.o. and £2
ss. place; she was 14 to 1 s.p. Sir Alwynne
(20’s in the ring) paid £27 Bs. for a win and
a; 8 9s. for a place; Huett* (10’s) returned
£7 135., and £2 65.; and tote backers of Leopos
(B’s) got back £7 9s. and £2 6s. Dividends on
placed horses were as follows, the ring price
being put in parentheses: Athgarvan (10 s), £1
B’s; Jolly Odd (6 to 4), 165.; Vendace (10's), £1
45.; Kongoni (evens), 145.; Moinette (20’s), £2
10s.; Brownface (7’s), £1 Is.; Eracre (6’s), £1
175.; Borriskoane (7’s), £1 65.; Blue Steel (15’s),
£2 Is.; Piargea (33’s), £l2 18s. If the three
big States catered for the small punter as well as
Westralia does “the game” would be in a much
healthier condition.
“Robert Carew”: M.L. is the place for tidy
tote divs. On the first day of the W.R.C. meeting
at Trentham almost every first dividend ran into
double figures. If a man had backed every starter
—it would have required an outlay of £l93 —he
would have gone home winning just on a tenner.
Even then he wouldn't have struck the biggest divvy
of the meeting—Kiosk’s £36 on the second day.
It was much the same at the N.Z. Cup meeting,
where, on the first day, backers of Comic Song re-
ceived their pound-notes back with £lOl 16s. 6d.
added. In the first division of the Linwood Minotus
paid £4O Bs. Backing every horse, a punter would
have shown a profit of £7B on an outlay of £129.
“Ascot”: Many Queensland owners are
coming to the conclusion that horse-racing is not the
game it is cracked up to be. In the last four months,
out of 469 horses raced in Brisbane, 103 have won
races and 118 have taken out place-money ; the re-
maining 248 haven’t earned a penny. Less than half
the owners (85 out of 177) led in winners. Of
the 95 jockeys riding, 54 haven’t straddled a winner
this season. Some of the licensed trainers haven’t
prepared a winner since Windbag was a foal, yet in
some mysterious wav they manage to keep p-oing.
« * *. a
“Ricardo” ; I have often suggested to race-
club secretaries that instead of padding racebooks with
useless information they should devote a page to
giving the correct pronunciation of the names of
the horses engaged. None of them will take the
suggestion seriously, yet for want of such a guide
even quite simple names are mangled in a way to
make the judicious grieve. I know a bookmaker
who earned a reputation for singularity by pro-
nouncing Bete Noir correctly; the rest of the tribe
made it Beet Nore or Beety Nore. Poseidon, of
course, was Pozza-dun, when he wasn’t Poys-aun;
Polycrates became Polly-erates, and Polybius was
known as Polly-buy-us. There was some excuse
for turning Cetigne into Se-teen. The native pro-
nunciation, I am told, is Set-in-yah, or something
like that—and then you are not right. Pilliewinkie
ought to be easy enough, but the M.L. gelding is
Periwinkle to 90 per cent, of bookies and punters.
A standard pronunciation would be a boon to both
classes.
* * * *
“Ascot”: Nearly all the Queensland Labor
Ministers are patrons of the sport of kings—and
politicians. Ex-Premier Gillies was no racegoer,
but McCormack, who succeeded him, Stopford, Jones
and Kirwan are keen sports. On a big day at
Ascot it would be easy to hold a Cabinet meeting
on the lawn, with a full quorum present.
HTS NOTION OF TT.
“Hey, how far is if to the station?”
“Roughly, two drives, a mashie and a putt.”
“Percy Pawnticket”: Curious is the soft-
heartedness of the “sport.” Just before the Cup
meeting a Melbourne tailor was approached by a
dead-to-the- world acquaintance with a plea for a
first-class outfit, the stone-broke swearing by all the
gods that he would pay “after the meetin’.” He
had “a good lurk on,” he declared, but needed
decent clothes. Snips allowed himself to be per-
suaded, and even lent the impecunious one a pair
of field-glasses. His confidence was not misplaced;
the debtor came along “after the meetin’,” exuding
notes from all his pockets, to settle up. He gave
Snips the story as a mark of gratitude. He had
made a point of following noted punters from
book to book, and seizing an opportunity to talk
to those who had had substantial wins. Sometimes
they would bite at a shrinking, reluctant request
for enough silver to take him back to the city; then
he would curse the luck, and mention the vast
sums he had “done in.” A handful of betting
tickets—picked up on the course—would be pro-
duced as evidence of good faith. The scheme
seldom failed. One big winner passed him two £lO
notes; another, in addition to pressing currency into
his hands, motored him into town and poured
liquor and food into him to cheer him up. Prob-
ably an ordinary hard-luck story would have left
all his victims cold; but each of them regarded
it as the duty of one sport to help another to whom
the goddess they courted had given a “cooler.”
“Myoldern”: Democracy got an innings
when the officials of the Darwin Race Club were
chosen. The treasurer i,s a hotelkeeper; the handi-
capper is a manual laborer; the starter is a dentist;
the stewards are an auctioneer, a schoolteacher and
a laborer; the timekeeper is an engineer ; the secre-
tary is a schoolteacher; and the judge is Government
Secretary.
* * * *
“Bris" : Had Tim Simmons lost the Queens-
land Cup on protest, after winning on Wee Glen by half
a city block, he would have been justified in growling
“It’s just my rotten luck.” On a previous visit
to Brisbane Simmons rode Venture tad to victory
at Albion Park; he won quite easily—-and was um-
pired out for bumping the second horse at the home
turn. The protest against the Cup winner was
backed by a prominent member of the Q.T.C. com-
mittee (“Pearl-king” James Clark, owner of Tabra-
galba), but that did not influence the “stipes.”
When the protest failed, Simmons was called upon
to answer a charge of rough riding; he was cleared
of that, too, so he can claim to have won the Cup
three times.
* * * *
Paul Demsky, who has quite fulfilled his
early Queensland promise, after trying the primrose
path and finding it no bong, stopped Mariano
Adriano for the second time at the Sydney
Stadium. Five weeks ago Paul knocked the
brown lad out in the twentieth round; on
Saturday night he so badly chopped him up,
mainly by means of an excellent straight left and
wicked right uppercuts shooting up the chest in the
close work, after the fashion exploited by Jack
Johnson, that “Maryann” informed his manager at
the end of the thirteenth that he had had enough.
Wallis, the referee, had been uneasy for several
rounds; but Adriano was foolishly game, or he might
have been saved a lot of punishment. As it was,
the doctor had to put six stitches in his lip when
it was all over, and his port lamp was practically
extinguished from the second round onwards. Demsky
9st. 121 b., Adriano 11b. less.
* * * «
Popular enthusiasm failed to draw vast
crowds to the Melbourne Stadium to inspect the
middleweight encounter between Eddie Parker,
champion of M.L., and Alf Stewart, ex-champion
of Australia. Parker was 21 lb. heavier than Stewart,
who was list. 9jlb. The Victorian has improved
of late months, and his straight left was very
effective. Parker relied chiefly on hooks, but while
he was thinking about delivering them that pound-
ing straight left landed frequently and painfully
on nose, mouth and chin. In the fourteenth Eddie
went down for nine, and after another long count in
the next round he was so obviously incapable of
being anything more than a target for the tireless
left that the referee stopped the fight, awarding
the victory to Stewart. The spectators voted it.
unexciting, but Parker was of a different opinion.
* * * *
“0.L.”: Nothing could more vividly depict
the deplorable lack of class among English boxers
than the news from London that Ernie Rice had
knocked out Ernie Izzard inside four rounds. Rice
(really Ernesto Ricci) was a horrible disappoint-
ment to Stadiums, Ltd.; and that he could get a
contest at the National Sporting Club is in itself
amazing to anyone who saw his pitiful exhibitions in
Sydney in 1924. Izzard must be a very poor sample
of the never-was class.
“S. Touteh”: “F.N.W.” (B. 19/11/’25)
is all for 20-round fights. I wonder if he ever
had ’em on and felt the strain of even three rounds
of real hard going. In America 10 rounds is the
usual thing and 15 the legal limit. Fights to a
finish have been prohibited since poor devils like
Wolgast (and there were others) were rendered
actually insane by frequent and savagely-prolonged
thumping. Also, fatalities in the Australian ring
have not usually occurred in the sixteenth round;
it was the eighteenth that was particularised.
Scarcely ever has a boxer been killed in “fiercer
bouts of shorter duration,” let alone “inside three
rounds.” It is the long-continued battering of the
head, and the physical exhaustion that precludes
proper defence or even recuperation between rounds,
that prevent the heart from functioning properly and
superinduce bloodclots on the brain and the sleep
that knows no awakening.
* * * *
With a bit of help from the weather. South
Aus. has started to fulfil its promise to make things
interesting in the Sheffield Shield this season. Vic-
toria led on the first innings through Blackie’s
super-bowling; but in the second he wasn’t a super-
bowler any more. (Incidentally, he was scolded
by an umpire for using his thumbnail to raise
the seam on the ball.) S.A. having piled up 410
runs, there came rain, and, though this did no
good to Grimmett’s curly stuff, Scott’s fast ones
became deadly, in both senses. Ellis- had broken
his thumb on a tramcar overnight, Willis let a
ball from Scott run up the bat and break his nose,
and the visitors’ total was only 182, S.A. beating
Vic. for the first time since 1914. With things
crashing all round him, Hendry scored a free and
chanceless 65 not out, a feat which, following his
5 wickets for 99 the day before, resulted in his
being picked to play for Australia v. The Rest
at Sydney on December 4. To the surprise of most
cricketers, Pritchard, the S.A. left-hander, was
omitted from The Rest. So far from taking his
exclusion to heart, Pritchard made a beautiful 167
(in 192 minutes) in the return match against the
Westralians, whom the Wheat Staters beat by nine
wickets, and he may get a game in Sydney—per-
haps on the Australian side if Johnnie Taylor is
unable to play.
“Mars”; South Aus. seems destined to supply
Australia with left-handed batsmen. Following in
the footsteps of Joe Darling and Clem Hill are
Pritchard, Rymill, Gun and Wainwright—all in this
vear’s State team. Three of the four went to St.
Peter’s College, as also did “Nip” Pellew and his
brother L.V., Jack Murray and ex-wicketkeeper
Gordon Campbell. “Nip,” by the way, reappeared
for S.A. in the second match against Westralia, but
was dismissed l.b.w. for 1.
“G. 0.8.”; After the defeat in Adelaide, Victoria’s
policy of relying on the same old buffers year after
year should be changed. The selectors’ only excuse
for keeping brilliant young players on the waiting
list was that an XI with 15 victories on end
against S.A. and only one defeat by N. S. Wales
since 1920, could not be improved. Thus, though
Schneider, Rayson and Gamble did well in a game
or two when old-stagers were not available, the
youngsters were dropped as soon as the veterans
wanted to play. As Blackie, with his best cricket
behind him, got his chance at 42, Schneider, Ray-
son, Gamble and co. would be well advised to
quit the game for 15 or 20 years. After that lapse
of time they would be pretty sure to get places in
the State XI, and to retain them until they quali-
fied for the old-age pension.
“Hamer”: Those who watched the colts’
match between S.A. and Victoria on the Melbourne
Cricket Ground were not surprised that the heavens
were moved to tears, which damped the ground to
such an extent that the dreary affair had to be aban-
doned. Victoria toilfully made 188 in the first
innings, and S.A. scored 97; then Vic. fell for
48, and S.A. started to show that it could do worse
by losing two wickets for nil. The noteworthy per-
formances were those of Bbeling (Vic.), who alto-
gether captured 10 wicl{ets for 37 runs, besides
making 22 in the first innings; and McKay (S.A.),
who got 2 for 34 in Vic.’s first innings, 5 for 11
in the second, and 22 not out.
“Tren”: The Vic. Cricket Association, by
retaining covered wickets though N. S. Wales and
South Oss have decided to discard the tarpaulin,
shows more concern for its finances than for the edu-
cation of players. The sorry procession of Austra-
lia’s best batsmen on a bad wicket in the third
Test at Adelaide last January taught the V.C.A.
nothing. With Tate, Gilligan and Freeman unable,
through injury, to bowl or field at their top, with over
200 on the board, and Ryder, Ponsford, Andrews,
Vic Richardson, Ivelleway, Gregory, Oldfield and
Mailey to bat, Australia had visions of a record
score. Game a little rain, however, and the seven
wickets fell before Kilner (4 for 14) and Woolley
(3 for 25) for a miserable 39. A wet summer might
turn the next tour in England into a rout.
* * * *
“H. Hardupp”: The proposal that there
should be a sort of sub-grade in inter-State cricket,
for the benefit of Westralia, Queensland and Tas-
mania, is worth following up. It would save any
more overloading of the big-cricket programme and
do a lot of good to the game in the backward
States. One-sided matches with Sheffield Shield
States, which put in their best teams in a jealous
fear that wallopings administered by the others may
eclipse their own performance, are little, if any,
help to promising youngsters in Brisbane, Hobart
and Perth; if they are bowlers, indeed, they are
more likely to be disheartened than encouraged.
An unusual motor record has been put up
over the difficult (estimated) 1600 miles from Bris-
bane direct to Adelaide. The drivers were P. R, A.
Irons and G. 11. Bar-

ney. They left the
G.P.0., Brisbane, at
4.30 a.m. on Sunday,
and got into trouble
early, having a bad
collision with a bullock
at Inglewood and get-
ting bogged at Goondi-
windi. However, they
made it as nearly a
non-stop run as they
could, and, pushing on
across N.S.W., via
Bourke and Broken
Hill, reached the
southern capital at
10.28 p.m. on Tuesday.
“Lounge Lizard”: For 40 years, off and
on, 1 have been attending cricket matches on the
Sydney C. G., and in all that time I have never
seen a really fast left-hand bowler or a slogging left-
hand batsman. Darling, Bruce, Moses, Hill and Bards-
ley could drive hard, but as sloggers they weren’t in
the same street with Bonnor, McDonnell, Massie or
Lyons, all mighty right-hand smiters before the
Lord. And bowlers? Ferris, Peel, Saunders, Briggs,
left-handers all, were medium to fast medium.
Spofforth, Richardson, Lockwood, Cotter and Jones
of yore, and Gregory and McDonald to-day—all fast
to very fast right-hand. Somehow the left-handers
haven’t the driving or propelling power of the
right-handers.

Policeman G. R. Parker cut a lot more re-
cords in winning the seven-miles walking champion-
ship of N.S.W. at the Sydney Sports Ground. He
completed the seven miles in 52min. 45 l-6see. —
21 4-ssec. better than his own time in the same
race a year ago, and 2min. 4 2-ssec. slower than the
world’s record established by G. H. Goulding in
New Jersey 10 years ago. Parker’s new Australasian
record times were: 4 miles in 29min. 31 4-ssec.;
5 in 37min. 40 2-ssec.; 6 in 44min. 50 2-ssec.;
7 miles 1649 yards in the hour. Gardiner, the
Victorian, was second in the seven-mile race, his
time being 56min. 24 4-ssec., and R. J. Latham was
third.

“Lond”: Rugby football in England this
winter is to give a thorough trial to the seven-
a-side tournament, already popular in Scotland. The
team is usually placed thus: 1 back, 2 three-quarters,
1 half-back and 3 forwards. The pace is tre-
mendously fast, and the playing time limited accord-
ingly.

“Lond” : Amateur billiards in England is
to be a much more strenuous matter than formerly
The provincial centres have been increased to 14,
and, when each of these has thrashed out local
supremacy, two names from each will go into the
hat with four from London—much on the Football
Cup lines. The youhg blood lately elected on the
Council has also made a firm decision to scrap
ivory balls in favor of composition.-
THE SEAMY SIDE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The practices of using resin and raising the
seam have been condemned by English cricketers,
but Mailey is able to show that there is a precedent
for everything he wants to do.” —London Daily
Telegraph.
The youngster gazed on the cricket ball, enshrined
on the mantelshelf,
In his face was a rapt and reverent look (I’ve felt
that way myself).
It was mounted and framed in costly style, and
underneath was told
How it rattled the English wickets down in a
famous game of old.
“O Dad”—and the hero-worship breathed no written
word conveys—
“What a ripping day it must have been, what a
glorious day of days
When you took that ball in your strong right arm
and ambled up to the crease
And settled the last three batsmen’s hash for a
couple of runs apiece!
“When the stands were hushed and Australia’s hopes
upon your googlies hung
Did you nerve yourself for a feat supreme as the
ball at the stumps you swung ?
Did you bowl as you never had bowled before,
screwed up to your super-best?
Were they breaks or sw’erves unplayable that won
our chaps the Test ?
“Had the captain’s hand on your shoulder fall’n as
. he urged you to play the game?—
'Twas a batsman, I know, in Newbold’s rhyme, but
the principle’s the same.
Did your heart with patriot fervor glow ? Was it
earnest purpose, Dad,
That gave you the skill and the strength of ten,
like knightly Galahad?”
The old man grinned. “ ’Twas a feat all right, a feat,
as you say, supreme.
You take the trophy out of the cage and have a
squint at the seam.
That’s the stuff w'e gave ’em then —and it took some
artfulness, by gum ! —
Yes, I raised it up with my thumb, sonny, I worried
it up with my thumb.
“ ’Twas the way to compass the subtlest swerve, to
puzzle the keenest bat.
But they reckoned it over the odds, sonny, and
they put a stop on that.
And when they got an intangible seam, by law
of the M.C.C.,
It queered my pitch and I chucked the game—
there was no more cricket for me.”

THE INKY WAY.
“Ces”: J. M. Walsh, writer of serials and short
stories, is finding his trip to the Cold Country
profitable. Latest reports are that since he arrived
in London early this year he has placed three novels,
and is steadily writing himself into the short-story
magazines.
“Derwent”: Another ex-Hobart Mercury youngster
is moving- along well —George C. Dixon, whose book.
“Prom Melbourne to Moscow,” is winning good
notices in England and America. Dixon, who started
on a tramp abroad a couple of years ago, was for
a time the Melbourne Herald's descriptive writer.
He is now on the editorial staff of the London
Daily Mail.
“The Deacon”: One of the veterans of the Inky
Way is Father Michael Watson, the Victorian Jesuit
who at one time or another has edited most of the
little R.C. organs which circulate throughout Aus-
tralia, writing much verse at the same time. Now
he has gathered the best together in a little book
called “Lyrics of Innocence,” illustrated by copies
of sacred pictures, the best being Raphael’s “Ma-
donna di Foligny.”
“Glenbrae”: The Capricornian, the weekly of
the Rockhampton (Q.) Mornino Bulletin, completes
its half-century this year. Three Buzacotts have had
their fingers in the office pi at one time or another.
C.H., whose brother was one-time Deputy P.M.G.
for Queensland, was the proprietor-editor when the
Capricornian earned its first sixpence in January,
1875. Its present editor, J. C. Collins, formerly
pushed a sub-editorial nib on the daily product.
“A.S.”; Australia has few printing-history heir-
looms. But in the office of the Ararat' (Vic.)
Advertiser there is a treasured genealogical tree of
a sort—and, incidentally, a tribute to the enterprise
of the proprietor, A. H. Banfield. It is a little
museum of type-composing machinery. A Porter,
two Hattersleys, a Pulsometer, and a* monoline pre-
cedo the present linotype, showing the transition
from typesetting to line-casting machines. There is
fine educational material in what to the casual eye
might look like a marine-dealer’s junk-store.
Brig”: The burly form and jovial personality
of poet Jim Philp have been missing from Brisbane’s
streets for the last month or two. Philp has had a
bad time with low fever, and has been convalescing-
at Southport. Unexpectedly his verses became one
of the issues of the Federal election. A couple of
years ago he published a little red-clad booklet
entitled “Songs of the Australian Fascisti,” being
a collection of verses (mostly political) which had
originally appeared in The Bulletin and the
Courier. The Labor paper cited the booklet as
proof that the Fascisti had been organised in
Queensland, and that the Courier knew all about
them!
Nationalism’s new member for Henty (Vie.) is
Fla »ry O- ullett, a former editor of the S. M. Herald’s
Land column, a soldier at the start of the Big
scrap and a war correspondent, with a limpid
style, afterwards, who saw the Palestine campaign
th l ough and wrote the volume dealing with it in
Australia s official record. For a while after the
war he brought his knowledge of Australia to bear
oil the job of- Director of Immigration. Printers’
ink and a flair for politics and agriculture run in
the family s veins. It was his uncle, the beloved
Henry, who piloted the S. M. Herald’s leader
columns through the campaign which gave Australia
, (’delation and the House in which the Harry of a
later generation should make his mark.
“Dalba”: England’s first woman reporter died in
London at the end of August. She was Miss Mary
Bulington, the daughter of a country clergyman and
was on the staff of the London Daily Teleoriph
for many years. Her jobs took her to the Delhi
Durbar m 1911, and she paid visits of investigation
to Russia and India. During the war she was much
interested in women’s camps and hospitals. Yet
the women who accompanied the recent “press dele-
gation” to Australia expressed surprise at the variety
of work accomplished by Australian women jour-
nalists, and asserted that England did not have
women reporters except for purelv social affairs.
Poor things! They evidently knew as little about
working journalism as the majority of the male so-
called delegates did.
“Hamer”; Llewellyn Griffiths, the “Copabella” of
many Bulletin pars, and much verse, is going north
as editor of the Bundabcrg (Q.) Daily News
and Mail. Griffiths is a very capable all-round
journalist, whose first experience on a daily paper
was gained during a four-years’ grapple with the
combined jobs of chief-of-staff, sub-editor, No. 1
roundsman and special “woman writer” on the Gee-
long Times. By way of side-lines, he wrote occasional
leaders, filled most, of a Melbourne daily’s verse
column, and put the butter on the family crust
with Bulletin contributions. Three years ago
Punch absorbed him for equally variegated duties,
with book criticisms and theatre reviews added:
in his off-time he was a sort of sub-manager and a
buffer between literary and advertising people.
“Tabac”-; The death of- R. R. Carrington, chief of
N.S.W. Hansard staff, recalls a slight, boyish-looking
Englishman taking his place for the first time In
the reporters’ gallery of Parliament House in Hobart.
This was in the mid-’eiglities, when life was much
easier-going than it is now. On the Mercury’s
reporting staff—for there was no official Hansard
in the Speck of those days—were Geo. B. Edwards,
Carrington and myself Those were the days when,
if it happened that Mr. Speaker had dined well and
found that the comfortable official chair and the
monotonous flow of debate tended to produce som-
nolence, the House, after one or two polite attempts
to awaken him, would adjourn. As the Mercury
was the only southern news-sheet, members
were naturally jealous of the attention they received,
and on one occasion our little staff was told to
exercise its abilities to the utmost and report an
unimportant hut dissatisfied member with literal
accuracy. We did so, and the unfortunate man’s
speech appeared with all its hesitancies, incompleted
sentences, ungrammatical phrases and multiple de-
fects in full. It was cruel but effectual. Our editor,
a shrewd old Scotchman, James Simpson, the pre-
decessor of Nicholls, the father of the present Chief
Justice .of the island, remarked complacently: “The
mon will make no more complaints,” He did hot.
We were a very happy family, with not too much
to do, and certainly with not too luxurious salaries
to do it on. Of the men on the Staff of that day
probably I alone survive. Geo. Edwards married
into jam—his wife was one of the Peacock family—
made a pilgrimage to Sydney, the then Mecca of all
Tasmanian youth, tinned more jam, waxed fat,
became a popular member of the Federal House of
Reps., and came to his death by a gas explosion
whilst yet in the days of vigor. Carrington also
went to the big town, joined the D.T., then became
a member of Hansard staff, and, with the quiet
persistence that was his, climbed to the top of that
little tree.
COMMONPLACE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Pale rose the moon in choddar-tinted light
Over the pudding brownness of the hills ;
The stars, like scattered sago, filled the night,
The tufted grass was as a thousand pills.
The air was like thick kapok soaked in tea;
We spoke as in some tin-horned phonograph,
Still plodding with a hungry energy
Towards the linoleum where none may laugh.
By the bone braces-buttons of the truth
We hang to dreariness as others do,
Missing the pleasant pangs of early youth
When distance lent enchantment to the stow.
Let us be sensible and change our shoes.
The mat skews sideways on the polished floor ;
Home shines with various ointments that they use
To keep the smell of virtue round the door.
Ere long the evening paper will arrive.
Four at the table we shall sit and say
“Please pass the cruet!” We are still alive,
Thank God we have endured another day!

A moving picture tliat can be viewed from
the back as well as the front, can be heard
and smelt and offered chocolates and flowers,
interviewed in the green-room and taken to
supper afterwards, has points above the
ordinary flat article, and might, if properly
developed, cause a slump in real estate at
Hollywood. Such a movie in three dimen-
sions is “Secrets,” the new offering at Sydney
Criterion. A prologue, anno 1922, discloses
Muriel Starr as a grey-haired old lady sur-
rounded by her grown-up family whose mem-
bers hold by the Freudian hypothesis that
love is a reaction of the nervous system.
Frank Harvey, their aged father, is dying
off-stage, and Muriel Starr falls asleep and
dreams three acts to prove the modern view
is wrong. In Act I of the dream-story,
dated 1867, she elopes in a crinoline and
other picturesque fixings of the period; in
Act II (1870) she saves her husband and
babe from being massacred by desperadoes
in a two-roomed shack in Wyoming, U.S.A.;
in Act 111 (1888) she learns that her hus-
band, now a London magnate, has been hav-
ing affairs with other ladies; in the epilogue
(1922) she is again the old lady with
her affection for her erring but still loving
spouse undiminished and the Freudian hypo-
thesis is shown to be a mockery and a fraud.
* * • * *
This critic differs from his learned col-
leagues of the dailies in their condemnation
of the second act, in which Frank Harvey
and John Fernside repel the desperadoes

with a lavish expenditure of ammunition and
commendable agility. He found it the only one
blessed with the quality of action. The rest
of the piece has intervals of good comedy,
much handsome dressing, a mort of moralis-
mg and as much dramatic interest as one ot
the Rev. Ruth’s homilies on life and conduct
in the Sunday Sun. Jean Walker, Ronald
Ward and Fred Conyngham, as Muriel Starr’s
adolescent family, showed signs of creeping
paralysis; and in Rosamund McMillan,
Kenneth Brampton and Charles Wheeler, as
the same family grown a little older, the
tendency was seen to be confirmed. Sidney
Stirling was a satisfactorily autocratic
father, Mildred Cottell and Emma Temple
discharged dowager parts with considerable
distinction, and Mary Marvin, as Mrs. Eus-
tace Mainwaring gave an exaggerated version
of a naughty lady of 1888. Frank Harvey,
Si ri? 6 i th i
showed no signs of havin„ lost himself in
ms part, which was not a part one would
want to get lost m, anyway. Muriel Starr
had a job of unusual difficulty. As Mary
Marlowe, the demure but sophisticated Vic-
torian Miss, she developed a vein of pleasing
comedy; and as Mary Carlton, newly
married, middle-aged and elderly, she was
admirable.

* * * *
Rene Maxwell sang “Phyllis Has Such
Charming Graces” for her first encore in
Sydney on Saturday night, and the delightful
old-world song just described herself, so
fresh, smiling and pleasing to gaze upon.
There was a fair audience, part of it more
interested in the sounds of their own voices
than in the offerings even of the star, albeit
she was as charming as when she delighted
Sydney audiences in “The Lilac Domino,”
her voice as fresh and clear and easily pro-
duced. It was an ambitious programme,
opening with the recitative and aria from
“Don Giovanni.” In this and all the sub-
sequent big numbers the young singer, de-
spite her true, sweet voice and pleasing plat-
form presence, gave a sensation of lack of
depth and finish. It might' have been the
outpouring of a mechanical bird. She was
much more satisfying in ballads; but even
here she confirmed the idea conveyed by her
operatic numbers that the songs she sings
have no meaning for her. Only once did
she make the musicianly part of her audi-
ence sit up and consider that she really did
have the qualifications demanded of a prima
donna, and that was in “Depuis le Jour,”
which she sang with spontaneity and tender-
ness. Nathalie Rosenwax accompanied her
sympathetically throughout. Alexander Sver-
jensky’s work at the piano did not receive
the appreciation it deserved; still, it takes
a genius to interest the average audience in
the piano, and then it lias to know before-
hand that a genius is performing. Sver-
jensky was heard with most pleasure in his
Chopin and Liszt numbers. The violinist
Alexander Chuhaldin, who plays with his
eyes modestly east down and a dreamy ex-
pression around his straight, sad mouth,
made the fiddle sing to match his looks. His
technique is beyond reproach, and he gave
a finished performance of Wieniawski’s
Grand Concerto in F sharp minor. He was
recalled twice, a big compliment, considering
the star had not made her appearance. But
it was a greedy audience. The violinist was
heard at his best in his own composition, a
tender melodious trifle, “Love Song of a
Hero.” Still any violinist who visits Sydney
so soon after Kreisler has a critical time
ahead of him. It would be well to find out
the great one’s favorite items and at least
cut these out.

“Leave It to Jane.” For Janes are ever

Wherefore Delilah’s work is still being left

* * * *
“The Outsider,” which Maurice Mosco-
vitch selected as his farewell offering to
Sydney, is unworthy of his genius; but as
it is regarded by an undiscriminating public
as a dramatic masterpiece—well, why argue?
Further, as Moscovitch is to a large extent
the servant of the public, he interpreted the
role of the one-time Chicago slaughterman
turned medical charlatan with a vehemence
that completely dominated everybody else on
the stage. His opponents being subdued, the
contrast was too glaring, and this merely
added to the play’s improbabilities. The
stooping to melodrama made Moscovitch’s
exit less successful than it might, could and
should have been. William Stack, who re-
placed George Blunt as the pompous Sir
Nathan Israel, and Marie Baton, who wore
Roslyn Vane’s apron as the housemaid, were
the only changes in the cast.
* * * *
The slight slump in the quality of Sydney
Tivoli programme this week can be charged
to the Ormonde, which met bad weather
and is behind time. The big Orient boat
was to have brought Ella Shields and “Bur-
lington Bertie,” who would have filled the
void left by Herschel Henlere’s departure.
As it is the Tivoli is suffering from a surfeit
of mediocrities. Bruce Green, a humorist in
female garb, is a little better than the rest;
still his two sketches, “I Still Went on with
My Knitting” and “The Washing on the
Line,” could be improved. Maurice Dia-
mond’s dancing girls please more with their
physical-culture exercises than their voices.
A trio of club manipulators and a trick
cyclist are also tolerable features.

Professor Holme might not think much
of the methods of teaching adopted by “The
Schoolmaster” of Gayle Wyer’s revue at
Sydney Fullers’ this week, but if they were
adopted in the State schools the attendance
would be higher even if other things slipped
a bit. The Littlejohns journey round the
stage on gigantic spheres while they pelt
one another with ironmongery; Phil Lopaz
is also in the juggling profession, but relies
more upon clowning; and the El Radiants
tinker with electric switches and produce
some novel lighting effects.

ness and a South American revolution seem
poles apart, bat Johnny Hines combines
them in “The Crackerjack” at the Lyceum,
an absurd but delightful burlesque. There
are nine reels of “The Scarlet West” at the
Piccadilly, and more Red Indians in the cast
than there are people in Goondiwindi (Q.).
“The Thief of Bagdad” continues to baffle
the police of Arabia at the Prince Edward.

Lionel Lindsay has a turn: —
The best bit of drawing Lionel Lindsay has yet
done is the “Shearers’ Cook,” which is No. 13 in
his show of etchings, aquatints and woodcuts at
the Macquarie Galleries, Sydney; the pleasantest
chuckle from out back is the bushie and his expectant
hound in No. 24 ; and the liveliest composition is
No. 5, “Ben Hall’s,” with its parallel lines of
forest and shanties broken by the approaching horse-
man and his pack-pony. Lindsay’s new dry-points
are full of a warm light absent from his older
etchings. The woodcuts are- clever, but only
studies. Altogether a rattling show, cheaply-priced.
Any selection from it would be more likely to keep
father at home next Christmas than the half-
dozen silk socks you contemplated. A romantic
Spanish picture (No. 19) reminds that the artist
is shortly off to De Riviera’s country for fresh
inspiration.
* * *
Samuel Sweetland, a prosperous farmer
of the West Country of England, mindful
of a wife whose “last sweet words” had to do
with the airing of his underpants, and in view
also of the likelihood of his two daughters
finding men of their own to look after, con-
siders the possibilities, after two years of
widowerhood, of marrying again. The possi-
bilities are four: Louisa Windeatt, a fox-
hunting widow; Thirza Tapper, a faded old
maid of great “genteelity” ; Mary Hearn, a
shallow vulgarian who is the village post-
mistress ; and a widow lady who keeps a pub
at Dawlisli. Sweetland’s wooing of the
quartette, in the course of which he explains
to each that he can be led by a child but
cannot be driven by an army, goes less well
than he anticipates; and the jolt to his self-
esteem brings him to a realisation that an
unambitious woman nearer at hand who was
not regarded as amongst the possibilities,
but has always shown zeal in his interests,
is the woman for him, just as three of the
others and a telegram from the fourth, the
pub lady, arrive to offer a reconsideration of
first refusals. That, with the working-out
of a minor tangle in the love-affairs of
the daughters, is the theme of “The Farmer’s
Wife,” presented at the Melbourne Royal on
Saturday night to a house which was kept
sizzling at the quaintnesses with which the
characters were painted into the picture.
A refreshing character-play, into which Eden
Phillpotts has worked the types of character
he uses so well in his novel-writing, it is
full of rich humor and amusing situations,
and although on Saturday the first act moved
slowly the fault was not sufficient to inter-
fere with the generous enjoyment it gave.
An outstanding characterisation was Susan
Richmond’s Thirza Tapper, of whom, as she
fusses about her epochal party, Churdlcs
Ash (Edwin Brett) remarks: “She's like a
hen wanting to lay her first egg, and she
can’t find a place good enough.” In an
excellent make-up as the old farm-servant
who hates women, Edwin Brett handled a
large helping of the “fat” in a capital man-
ner. The picture of the honest, self-satisfied
farmer, Samuel Sweetland, drawn by Towns-
end WMtling, very fine at its best, was un-
equal ; perhaps the weight of production on
a first night had some effect. Very fine work
as one of the awkward younger lovers, Rich-
ard Coaker, was done by Graham Stuart;
the other, George Smerdon, was effectively
handled by Ward Morgan. Mary Macgregor
was a charming Sibley Sweetland; Frances
Cave was the supposedly more brilliant
Sweetland daughter Petronell; Doris John-
stone, the Araminta Dench, who finally
gets a chastened farmer as a reward for
much faithfulness; Violet Ley, the fox-
hunting widow, Louisa Windeatt; and Em-
meline Orford, the postmistress. Of the
remaining characters, all fitting nicely into
the mosaic of mirth, Douglas Vigors, who
played Henry Coaker, a dodderer, and Scott
Clark, as a clergyman who never forgets to
put in a word about the needs of the parish,
were most noticeable. The strange mixture
of dialect was a fault; the West Country
tricks of speech had been gathered from all
parts of Britain and Ireland, and in at least
one case from Australia.

News of the carnival of laughter pro-
vided by Harry Green and Roy Rene at
Melbourne Athenaeum is bringing larger
audiences to “Give and Take.” The farce
seems likely to last out till Christmas.

A well-filled and sympathetic house
laughed whenever Nellie Bramley wanted it
to do so at the revival of “Paddy, the Next
Best Thing” at the King’s (Melb.) on
Saturday night—a change in arrangements is
keeping the co. at the King’s, running weekly
changes, until somewhere about Christmas.
The story of the Irish military officer who,
having no sons, finds consolation in one of
his daughters who is as nearly a boy as a
girl can be. has no great strength, but the
appeal to popular taste has been thrown in
by the spadeful. Nellie Bramley, making her
first appearance as Paddy with a fishing-kit,
overdid the hoyden business and the Irish
accent, but vastly pleased the audience.
George Bryant made a brave attempt to
subdue his massive voice in deference to the
heart disease of the character he played (he
was General Adair, the father of Paddy) ;

JBV APPOINTMENT TO
H.M. THE KING
The 19 60-H.P. CROSSLEY
HE 19/60-h.p. Crossley has probably
attracted more attention than any other
car in its class. Certainly it possesses a
very enviable reputation for all-round efficiency
and sweetness of running, and is recognised as
being a delightful car to handle. From five
miles per hour on top gear it can be rapidly
accelerated to sixty. Everything about the car
speaks of qualify, and its road performance
satisfies the most exacting.
Further, the fact that the 19/60-h.p. Cross-
ley broke all Ii.A.C. Certified Trial Car Mileage
Records when it completed 25,000 miles under
the observation of the Royal Automobile Club
supplies ample and conclusive proof of extra-
ordinary reliability. No other car has ever
approached this distance under official observa-
tion. The Crossley completed 25,000 miles with
only 31 minutes spent on adjustments or repairs
on the road, and at a total cost we have calcu-
lated to be l jd. per mile for oil, fuel and tyres.
Full details of this achievement gladly supplied
on application.
It must be emphasised that the 19/60-h.p.
Crossley is a car far above the ordinary, with
all the refinements which appeal to the experi-
enced motorist. Iluilt from the finest material
obtainable and with scrupulous care, it is a car
which can be purchased with confidence, and
which will live up to tint splendid reputation it.
has gained in every part of the world. Petrol
consumption results are better than those of any
other car of similar capacity.
The 19/60-h.p. Crossley was the first
British car to run from Adelaide to Darwin and
back under its own power. The car used had
previously run over 30,000 miles.
There are numerous 19/60-h.p. Crossleys ou
the road to-day which have already completed
over 150,000 miles, and are still running as
sweetly as ever.

September is a bad month in which to speculate. Other
months in which it is unwise to speculate are January,
December, February, November, March, October, May!
June, April, August, July. It’s the sober truth that every one
of these months is the best one in the year to add to your
savings account in this Bank, because the Bank pays a good
rate of interest on your money and you will take no chance of
losing even a penny, for your money is protected by the
guarantee of the Commonwealth Government. Practically

Commonwealth lank of Hustralia.
At the Melbourne Bijou “Willie’s Birth-
day” was this week’s offering of Willie
Lancet and his confreres—a hilarious trifle.
Three Melfords, neat dancers, are new-
comers; Nellie Kolle remains a favorite; and
June Mills employs her superfluous fat in
good-natured—and successful —attempts to
be amusing. There is to be another “Nellie
Kolle night” to-morrow (Friday), the song
her impersonators are expected to deliver
being “Fill ’Em Up. Fill ’Em Up, It Is My
Birthday.” After that the lady departs.

“A School for Wives,” a very badly
wanted institution, is in session at the Mel-
bourne Majestic this week; also a sentimen-
tal film which is the screen representation
of Leonard Merrick’s novel “The House of
Lynch.” “Lightnin’,” a film version of the
play, has come to Hoyt’s De Luxe, where Lila
Lee is “The Midnight Girl.” “Spring Clean-
ing” is another arrival in screen form at
one of the picture houses: it is called “The
Smart Set,” and is no better for that.

By no means an inspiring performance
was that given by the British Music Society
at the Melbourne Assembly Hall last Fri-
day. The string quartette plodded through
Arnold Bax’s G Major Quartette, giving very
little distinction to the movements, and it
was no better in the Havel Quartette in F;
whilst Sliiela Macfie and Dorothy Graham
went through the Delius Sonata for ’cello
and piano as if it were a painful duty. The
singing of Vaughan Williams’s “Merciless
Beauty” by Mrs. Alberto Zclman, to the
accompaniment of two violins and ’cello, was
far better.
* *
An art reminiscence and a mixed show:
The late Tom Humphrey’s paintings, shown at
the Fine Art Galleries in Melbourne, bring back a
memory of the days when art in Australia was
very poorly paid, and the wisest of its followers
were those who regarded their work at the easel
as something which, apart from the pleasure it gave
them, merely put butter on the bread they earned
by other means. They were a hard-working, con-
scientious crowd, who painted on to the picture every
stick they saw; the work contrasts strangely with
the more modern school, which has had the oppor-
tunity to develop a better knowledge of color values
and the art of leaving out. Nevertheless, this memo-
rial show exhibits several canvases that call for high
praise. The men of Tom Humphrey’s day painted
for the gallery rather than the home; to get the
right effect it is necessary to stand off from these
pictures, w'hose draughtsmanship is often faulty, but
whose color is always harmonious, suggesting a tender
appreciation of poetry in nature. “The Road to
Bright” (No. 8), “Winter” (No. 3) and “Evening,
Black Rock” (No. 15), are amongst those which
most appeal; the impulse to copy the work of others
is evident elsewhere, spoiling their individuality,
although in the whole collection there is good, honest
work.
At a mixed show at the Queen’s Hall (Melb.) the
etchings of Jessie Traill, exhibiting the impact of
imagination upon reality, are the most impressive.
“The Hole in the Trees” (No. 5) in particular is
very stirring. The etchings of Gyle Soilleux are set
and conventional, but are not unpleasing; and F.
G. Reynolds shows himself a slave to detail in a
number of water colors and a few pencil and chalk
drawings. There is liveliness in the sculpture of
Ola Cohn, including a “Portrait, Miss White,” which
is altogether puckish and captivating.
** * *
Adelaide Repertory has submitted two per-
formances of Galsworthy’s “Old English.”
The burden rested mainly on Wilfred Neill,
who gave a fine rendering, less deliberate
than Gregan McMahon’s, and with far more
emphasis on the humorous side. He had
valuable support from a large cast, notably
Harwood as the lawyer and Patricia Haekett
(a promising recruit to the Rep.) as the
grand-daughter. In pictures, Valentino is
ornamental in “Beaucaire” at the Pav., and
Barthelmess does his modern best at Wonder-
graph. The York relies largely on fizz and
gowns in “The Golden Bed,” but West’s
(with “Quo Vadis” coming) is purely
romantic in “The Stroke of Three,” which
relies on the fixed American impression that
if you mortgage your property it is gone for
ever. Elsewhere women are the top-liners,
Clara Butt at the Town Hall, and Lee
White at the Royal; both highly popular
off-stage as well as on, and both doing big
business. Herbert Myers, of the Royal, an-
nounces that Ernest Sefton and others of
the Lee White co. will stay on in Adelaide
for his open-air Garden Theatre.
From “A.G.M.” in London:—
Remarkable has been the success of Hilda Rix
Nicholas’s exhibition at the Beaux Arts Gallery
here. According to Frank Rutter, the critic, Mrs.
Nicholas’s work “marks a definite advance on any
purely Australian painting hitherto shown in Lon-
don.” Seeing that some very fine Australian
paintings have been exhibited during the last dozen
years, this is very high praise. And the gifted
Australian woman has no more enthusiastic admirers
of her work than George Coates and his wife,
Dora Meeson. George Coates, by the way, is paint-
ing a picture of Jean Forbes Robertson for the
winter exhibition of the Royal Society of Portrait
Painters.
Poverty
Point
“Tuart”: Queen Alexandra figured in an
unrecorded scene which an English actress
who spent her latter years in Sydney used
to call “the most dramatic episode of my
life.” The actress was on the stage of a
London theatre at the precise moment when
Edward, then Prince of Wales, and the sea-
king’s daughter entered the royal box. It
was during the Prince’s brief—very brief —
period of unpopularity, and there were hisses
from the pit and gallery as he took his seat.
Straightway the little Princess rose and em-
braced him; and the hisses were drowned
in a storm of cheers and shouts of “God bless
you.” Next day an emerald ring arrived for
the actress, with the polite regrets of H.R.H.
that he had been the means of spoiling her
scene.
“Csesar’s Ghost”: Tom Cannam, who re-
turned to the metropolitan boards, after
many years, to play Amos Bloodgood in “Are
You a Mason?” must be nearly the oldest
mummer in the business. Of recent years
lie has been trundling his own company about
the “smalls” in a Ford truck. Cannam came
to Australia under contract to Brough and
Boucicault, but he was an old stage identity
then, having started with Barry Sullivan.
That weird satisfaction which comes of being
able to recall the money you have lost is
Tom’s when he remembers that he financed
an English tour of William Rignold’s
(“Adam Bede” was the play), and dropped
£3OOO.
“A.G.M.” (Loud.) : Wil-
liam Mollison lias done ex-
ceedingly well since he was
producer in Australia for
the Gertrude Elliott co. On
the way home from Sydney
Mollison broke the journey
at Chicago and met Jack
Waller, who happened to be
staying at the same hotel.
Together they went to see
‘‘No, No, Nanette,” which so
impressed them that they
promptly secured the British
rights. Mollison produced
the thing at the London
Palace; its success was im-
mediate, and has brought
him a small fortune already.
The same happy results have
attended his production of
“Mercenary Mary” at the
London Hippodrome, where
the first-night audience nearly
shouted the roof off in its
enthusiasm. W'ithin 24 hours
the booking amounted to
£BO,OOO, and all London is
humming “Pm a Little Bit
Fonder of You.” Peggy
O’Neil plays the leading
part; she has no great gifts
as singer or dancer, but hex-
vivacity and charm are un-
deniable. A curious point
about Mollison’s success with
these two shows is that
Alfred Butt did not think
him experienced enough to
produce Gertrude Elliott’s
venture, “Dancing Mothers.”
Now half the managers in
London are eager to secure
his services. A younger
brother, Clifford Mollison, is about the ablest
young comedian on the London stage.
“Hamfat”: Australia is likely to lose Iloy
Rene. George Carney, now prospering in
/^PSland— and no one who saw him at the
l.ivoli will wonder at it—has offered Rene
a London engagement, and terms are being
arranged. Carney, with a memory of what
t- i lad ,. seei ? in Australia, collared Jack
ivirby directly that stout and amiable person
landed in London. Kirby immediately made
good.
Goldilocks”: Some of these publicity
men, in their desire to let you know all the
facts, have an awkward way of putting them.
We had been discussing a stage lady.
"Blahkby Bloomer is her husband, isn’t he?”
I asked. ‘‘Yes,” said the dope merchant
eagerly; “he has acted both here and in
England.”
“Stage Wait”: The outlook for the Aus-
tralian mummer is not at all promising,
judging by the number of complete com-
panies on their way to the Commonwealth.
With “The Farmer’s Wife” came all the
small-part performers, and Moscovitch, in
his Melbourne farewell, announced that he
was returning with fresh people. Melbourne
Hekald asserted that Mosco was “not
adequately supported,” which was putting
the boot in with a vengeance. Strange that
Williamson, Brough, Boucicaulfl and Holt,
who were not Australians, were satisfied
with Australian actors, whereas managers
who were born in Australia prefer importa-
tions.
“Hamfat”: The supernumerary, once
known to the profession as a banner-bearer,
has had his right to a fairly solid wage con-
firmed by the Commonwealth Arbitration
Court. The rate fixed was £2 per week, with
a proviso that even if the super was required
for but one night a week the £2 must be
paid. The arrangement hits shows like
Allan Wilkie’s, which, staging nightly
changes, may need a crowd for one perfor-
mance and not for others. The large British
force which Hem-y V. should lead is too
expensive at £2 per head for a single per-
formance ; so Allan Wilkie and a couple of
other actor-leaders have to urge an entirely
imaginary army of heroic English into the
breach, and drive before them an equally
imaginary army _of unheroic French, some-
what to the detriment of the performance.
“Flute-a-bec”: Why should “Cor Anglais”
be translated into “English horn” (B.
19/11/’2o) when It is nothing of the kind?
“Anglais” is a misreading for “anglee” or
angled. This term was originally applied to
the instrument because it differs from its
near relation the oboe in that the upper
part forms an angle with the main body.
“Hamfat’’: A new member of the Neil-
Tuohy co. is Eileen Alexander, the Maori-
land girl who while on a visit to Sydney
was selected to play Doreen in the original
production of “The Sentimental Bloke.” It
was a good engagement, that, for Eileen
played the part for 14 months. “On Our
Selection” provided another long-run engage-
ment ; and the lady has filled in intervals
by appearing with Ashton Jarry in Tivoli
sketches. _ She began her career as a solo
dancer with one of the Pollard companies.
A MATERIALIST.
“I'll sell you this beautiful study, note, for ten quid.
“ H'm, n-no But I’ll tell you what — I'll give you ten bob
for an introduction to the model.”
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : “The Playboy of the
A estern W orld, ’ which failed to draw in
Sydney, is now running at the Royalty with
Mai re O’Neil, Sara Allgood, Arthur Sinclair,
Fred O’Donovan and others of the Irish
I layers m the cast. London critics praise the
revival warmly: “There are no degrees in per-
fection” is the Telegraph’s striking sum-
mary. I saw this play in Dublin the other
day, and noted with surprise that the audi-
ence took it as a huge joke. On its first pro-
duction, as may be recalled, it was bitterly
resented as another injustice to Ireland.
Even to-day, both in England and Ireland,
it is variously regarded as a farce, a pro-
phetic review of recent political troubles in
Hibernia, a piece of anti-Irish propaganda,
and a satire on the Irish passion for hero-
worship. The Dublin public is getting tired
of play after play dealing with sordid aspects
ot Irish life. A recent success, “Juno and the
Paycock. was written by a laborer then
on the dole.
“Wood’s Green” (Lond.) : I hope Austra-
lia will see Edith Evans before she becomes
a light of other days. There is no more
interesting actress on the English stage.
She confounded convention by accepting an
engagement at the Old Vic., “to learn how to
play Shakspearej” as she put it, though she
had played several Sliakspearean parts be-
fore. Her Portia drew all the great critics
across the Thames and sent , them away
delighted. i She next appeared as Queen
Margaret in “Richard III.,” and her suc-
cess Was such that she seems likely to
challenge Sybil Thorndike’s supremacy in
tragedy, although comedy was supposed to
be her forte. As to that, no one who saw
her as Milamant in Congreve’s “Way of
the World” can forget the perfection of her
comedy. She could only be compared with
Rejane at the Frenchwoman’s best. Miss
Evans despises modern forms of publicity,
and has no use for interviewers, even when
they come in the guise of critics. An un-
usual woman altogether.
“R.D.”: One of the most interesting
theatres in the U.S.A. is the Wharf Players’
Theatre of Provincetown (Ohio), where
most of Eugene O’Neill’s plays were first
produced. The building is a little old place
near the wharves, was originally a factory
for cod-liver oil, and holds only a handful.
So widely has its fame spread, tlipugh, that
a number of the rich intelligentsia of New
York make a point of motoring down for its
productions. Besides O’Neill, a good many
leading lights of the American dramatic
world have been connected with it at one
time or another—Robert Jopes, the artist-
producer*, for instance, and Stark Young, the
dramatist and critic. At present it has for
producing director J. H. Greene, an Irisli-
Australian who was a contributor to The
Bulletin some years ago.
“Bond”: Bernard Shaw has at last, after
30 years, seen the ban removed from his “Mrs.
Warren’s Profession,” and it is being openly
played at the Regent. It proves to “date”
itself rather severely. The heroine’s bicycle
has been suppressed in the present rendering,
but there were audible smiles when her
mother Warned her that, if she would not
accept professional immorality as a career,
the only resource open to her would be
work as a barmaid, which would —in those
nappy bygone days—mean 14 hours a day.
That serious argument between mother and
daughter about the choice of a career still
leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. But, as
one critic says, the banning of any work of
art because it has an unpleasant theme is
an argument which, “if used nowadays, would
cause the suppression of almost every
written work, except possibly Bradshaw’s
Railway Guide.”
“Albatross”; I went the other day to a
free concert at the Rawson Institute for
Seamen (Sydney). Lord, what a change!
The bill-of-fare which seamen’s missions used
to provide consisted mostly of ludo, draughts
and Ungrammatical “tracts.” On this occa-
sion Jack Shellback was treated to an Up-to-
date vaudeville show with painted serio-
chronics and raucous comedians dispensing
their Usual fare. One,sketch in particular,
wherein a lady, wearing a garter watch,
keeps several gentlemen busy lifting her skirt
to see the time, was received with immense
enthusiasm. By the way, I had to scab to
attend this concert, for Tom Bolsh and his
pals have declared the Rawson Institute
“black.” It wouldn’t surprise me if they
called it blue,
“Caesar’s Ghost”: One change that has
taken place in stage customs has been so
gradual that it has almost escaped notice,
Nowadays the chorus, which used to be as
bare as possible, is well covered ; on the
other hand A bright young thing in
the chorus looked pensive when I asked her
whether she wouldn’t like to appear in
“straight” plays. “I would, in a way,” she
said, “but again I wouldn’t. In some of
those modern plays you have to wear so few
clothes.”
The best of four one-act plays produced
by Mostyn Wright at Melbourne Queen’s
liall was his own farce-comedy, “Affinities,
Ltd.,” in which, more or less efficiently, Het-
tie Feuerman played Mrs. Moya Ames, the
owner of a matrimonial agency; Mostyn
Wright, Phil Moreton (her manager) ;
I rank Goddard, Ferdie Brainerd. The other
three plays, two by Mostyn Wright and “The
Way Out,” by “Juliet,” were verbose, stilted
and mechanical —the last the most wearisome
of the three.
Sweet old English airs pervaded the Mel-
bourne Assembly Hall when May Broderick
(pianist) and Valerie Walsh (contralto) gave
a concert last week. Miss YValsh sings with
a sympathy which atones for a voice that
occasionally wears thin, and is hard under
stress; and in Philip Rossiter’s “What Is
Love?” and the old Irish airs “O Wearily,:
Wearily Lags the Day,” and “ ’Tis Pretty
to be in Ballinderry,” she was much better
than in a modern group. The pianist was
acceptable, especially as an accompanist; but
violinist Donald Mcßeath was disappoint-
ing. There ought to be more finish to bis
work by now.

KELVINATOR
Wherever you live the question of food conservation is important. The station-owner
need never throw out meat if he installs a Kelvinator. He can have fresh meat all the
time. The saving in this direction alone makes Kelvinator an investment, not a luxury,
to the man on the land. The summer problem of keeping things cool is acute every-
where. Meat, milk, butter, eggs, all can be kept in the cold, dry air of Kelvinator
as long as you wish.
You could not eat contaminated foods if they have been stored in a Kelvinator.
There is no ice needed, for the temperature is maintained at the same level of cold
by the refrigerating unit. You can make ice, though, more than you can use, if you
want it. Think of the difference Kelvinator would make in your home. Beautifully

MAKING TYRE HISTORY
SUPERTWIST is doing that in Goodyear Balloons
Most of the earlier users of
Goodyear balloon tyres were im-
pelled to buy them by a desire for
greater riding comfort.
But these users have long since
learned that in Goodyear balloons
this greater comfort is matched by a
quite astonishing increase in service-
ability.
Indeed, in those sections of the
country where service and road con-
ditions ordinarily “burn tyres up in
a hurry,’’ Goodyear balloons to-day
are making history.
They are piling up mileage totals,
and records for sustained freedom
from trouble, that users say are
nothing short of revolutionary.
Back of the splendid achievements of
these Goodyears is the new cord
fabric SUPERTWIST, developed by
Goodyear to solve the special needs
of the modern flexible-sidewall tyre.
The superiority of this new material
lies in its greater elasticity; it far
outstretches the breaking point of
standard cord fabric.
When a Goodyear Tyre made of
SUPERTWIST strikes a stone, the
elastic cords yield to and smother
the impact, stretching under the
blow like rubber bands.
This unique ability to stretch and

Here are drills which give maximum

which keep their cutting - edge longer

THE NEW MEDIUM WEIGHT SIDECAR
Your Pleasure in Sidecarring
Depends on the Chassis
THE chassis of your sidecar is relatively as
important as the foundation of your house.
With Goulding Sidecars the patented floating
axle ensures comfort for the rider as well as
the passenger, and far less strain on the motor-
cycle.
The springs and lugs in black are those which have
been redesigned with the effect of more comfort and
strength, and lighter weight.
In most cases a Qoulding costs less than an ordinary Sidecar

A.J.M.: Too thin even for an ordinary
number... .0.W.M.; The telephones, easily. Gross
revenue of the telegraph branch (all Australia) last
year was £1,430,554, including a trifle from radio;
the telephones brought in £3,301,651 Boomerang:
If the man could get one or two people to swear that
they recognised him, the par. would cost us a
few thousands unless we could prove every word of
it—which, of course, we couldn’t... .Dick H.: Well
done; but why did you do it ? It is too horrible for
general consumption... .M.H.F.: No, it won’t do.
It doesn’t keep step with the facts of the case for one
thing... .C.McE.: A good yarn, with too much prelim-
inary song and dance. Usable if it were reduced by
one-third or more... .1.N.Z.: Pity, but that’s an old
one. .. .Balance: You leave off your yarn too often
to look at the scenery.... L. Forde: Best is a matter
of opinion, but try “The Crime of Sylvestre
Bonnard,” “The Gods Are Athirst,” “Red Lily,” “The
Opinions of JCrfime Coignard,” “At the Sign of the
Reine Pedauque” and “Penguin Island.” The last-
named is a satire and calls for some knowledge of
French history. Alternatively “The Wicker-work
Woman”.... Staple: You might do something worth
while if you took the trouble. You’ve got the ideas.
... . Bacea: But it’s not true —there has been a good
reduction in the Australian infantile death-rate in
the past 10 years. Last complete figures available
are for 1923. The M.L. 1923 rate is 1.54 (per 100
of births) better than the 1913 rate; the N.S.W.
1923 rate is 1.76 better than its 1913 rate....D,T.
(Casino): Not enough there to make a story....
E, J. 0.; The murder yarn lumbers along like a road-
roller. .. ,IV. D. (Granville): Smith’s musings are
rather mild and pointless... .A.R.H.: It goes back.
. ...Ande: Not nearly well enough done... .Lilian
B. ; Very weak and thin. .. . J.C.W.: In the last ditch
of futility... .Apariti: Not up... .H.W. (Mosman) :
All show merit, but are some distance below stan-
dard .... Sydney G.: They miss, but not by much....
Woodki: Doesn’t make us want to print it in colors.
. ...M.G.C.: A bit too absurd... .Tiro: Not bad, but
not up.... Ethel R.: How on earth do you manage
to see an echo of a call'?... .Playfair: Pretentious
rubbish... .Overlander; Hisses the track; but there
are lots more where it’s gone. ... J.R.L.: It’s a
delicate little lyric:—
The wowsers all favor prohibition
And will not allow to each the volition
To choose if he be a pig or a man,
Such small discretion their zeal outran.
We are like to be under the rule of the wowsers,
And of one-eyed women who wear the trousers,
Who would faint right off at the sight of beer,
And from snuff and tobacco keep quite clear.
The wowsers are wanting to close every pub,
Though where they would camp, ah, there is the rub ;
They would stop all the people from drinking beer
And from smoking their pipes, it is madness sheer - .
.. . .L.G. (Armadale) : Poor samples... .F.F. (Broken
Hill) : Lack interest, and a bit rough in workman-
ship.... C.N. (Wayville); Anyway, there is novelty
about rhyming “line” with “iron”... .W.M.8.L.:
None of them up.... Elsie D.: Not quite... .D.F.F.:
A bit too thin... .H.R.M.: The end of the bag
yarn spoils it.... A.D.M.: “The Cynic” doesn’t con-
vince... .G.T. (Roseville): The yarns don’t grip
hard enough... .8.J.A.: Not one of them gets near... .
Henry O.: The story may be true, but you don’t
make it look true.... J.E.8.; A poor kind of verse
that gets a little worse as it goes 0n.... Adam: To
rhyme “ally” with “ye” puts a strain on things. The
verse is very bad.... Ripponlea: The last chapter of
the serial is full of pathos:—
Thinking of the quicksands on the beach,
The old gentleman had given a low, feeble screech.
He blunder'd blindly for a short, thrilling spasm
Along the soft, sandy edge of the awful chasm,
Missed his footing and with heart-rending wails
Clung to a cluster of clover by his nails.
Slowly his Angers opened. They’d lost their power.
He flew downward at an hundred miles an hour.
Through the long night did they try to find the scent
Of which way the hapless old man had went.
Bemoaning and besighing the old man’s fate.
The repentant children feared they were too late.
“See!” suddenly said the son, “see,
Father is suspended from yon overhanging tree.”
“Thank Heaven,” gasped the daughter. “We will
mend
Our ways in future, dear husband.” (The End.)
.... Frontiersman,: Presumably it means something;
but we can’t afford to print verse merely for trained
detectives... .C.W.F.: Lame verse that gets in a few
commonplaces, but won’t say what you want it to
say .J.G.S.: Very crude... .damans: The yarn is
too mechanical... .R.P. (Coleraine) : Poor verse in
very bad shape... .D.M.S.: None of the sketches gets
to anything. .. .W.D.F.: The complicated dream is
not for u 5.... Allan S.: The yarn is too long-drawn-
out, and the conclusion not convincing... .O.M.
(Byron Bay) : Both are rather thin... .R.D.: Fair
material poorly handled... .E.M.G.: The verse misses.
The yarn has some points, but shows too many marks
of the machine.... Fuchsia: Too weak to carry the
idea... .Tog: “Murphy” is not a very thrilling person.
... .W.E.8.: The interest is very slight. .. .Mary R.:
Not enough in it....Barys: Not veryrwell written.
Too many of your points get lost in their unnecessary
packing-straw... .Y.F.D.; No music in it; and verse
of that sort needs singing quality.... R.L.W.: Very
unattractive... .Double You: Sorry; had as much as
we can stand on that subject... .Rolf: Doesn’t suit
us; but it is quite well enough done to 5e11....
C. : Stay where you are. Jobs as good are not
easily got... .G.K.8.; Off our beat. But" there are
others that would rush it....Powis: Comb it out.
The stuff is there, but it is all tangled.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
T.S.B.; All declined. The early Victorian gent,
in top-hat and side-levers declined almost with en-
thusiasm .... G.L.: For thrusting that lot on us
you deserve to be deported to Soviet Russia disguised
in Stanley Bruce’s spats... .T.L.: Weak pencil sketch
and joke to match... .J.F.W.: Fearsome example of
the art that isn’t... .B.C.: You send us a picture
that is a palpable steal and ask us to fit a gag to it.
Away with you!.... N.B-B.: One has slight virtues.
. ...E.S.: Not a bad try, but as awkward as a
bronze dragon... .N.P.: Your lady with the two left
legs is tripping home... .H.R.W.: It won’t make
a picture.
“ Jesmond”: The Seaside Garden Home for
Boys, Newhaven, Phillip Island (Vic.), has
been open for nearly four years. During
that time there has not been a single case
of illness necessitating a doctor’s services,
and only three accidents requiring a trip
to the doctor. As the number of boys in
residence has averaged between 50 and 60,
it speaks highly for the work of the super-
intendent and the matron, W. H. Baye and
his wife, and for the climate of the island.
Can a “home” in any other district even
equal this record?

Miss BERYL
FERGUSON.
To all lovers of outdoor sport a dip m the roaring breakers on a
Summers day is indeed romance. Next day the sunburnt, blistered hands
and scarlet face are painful realities. This distress can be avoided by the
application of soothing, cooling, healing Rexona, the Rapid Healer, to
the face, hands and arms.
Try the following treatment after your swim, and you will be
delighted with the happy results. First bathe the face, hands and arms in
fresh water, making a good lather with Rexona Soap. Massage with this,
then softly dry and apply Rexona, the Rapid Healer, gently to the skin.
If this is done there will be no after-effects from exposure to the sun,
no regrets after a happy day, for the skin, soothed by the wonderful
influence of Rexona, the Rapid Healer, will quickly regain its normal

“Bris.”: A Brisbane ladies' hairdresser
now makes use of the State Radio Service to
broadcast business boosts. If other adver-
tisers follow suit the radio programme sup-
plied by this Labor-controlled station will
consist of: (1) Speeches by Pinkish politi-
cians; (2) Russian propaganda; (3) mar-
ket reports; (4) advts.; and (5) ragtime to
till in the intervals.

“R.D.C.”: The proportion of butter im-
ported into England for the 12 months to
June 30 from the overseas dominions was 47
per cent, of the total, while cheese supplies
were 88 per cent. Keener competition looms
ahead, however. For the first time since the
war large consignments of butter were re-
ceived from Russia, and the quantity of Ital
ian cheese exported is steadily growing.
“Adamascus”: Following the example of
orchafdists who have allotted the product
of special trees or patches of ground to char-
ity (B. 29/10/’25), a wealthy W.Q. pasto-
ralist has a horse which runs for the benefit of
the local hospital. It is a fairly good per-
former, and all stake money won is promptly
passed over. Which reminds me that some
time back a Brisbane public service depart-
ment seized a horse, to satisfy a debt, and lias
since run the animal at Brisbane meetings
with fair success.
* * * *
“Matrix”: Woollen-mills proposals are
finding solid backing in Queensland. Char-
ters Towers has £82,000 on hand to manu-
facture “tops” from the Northern merino. A
contract has been signed for a plant capable
of handling 0000 bales annually and to be
completed in 10 months; and the layout is
to allow for a full spinning and weaving
section to be added later. It is a good Aus-
tralian project that merits a pat or two
between the shoulderblades.
**' * *
“Herodot” ; The value of alcohol as an in-
ternal-combustion engine fuel is shown by the
C.S.R.’s use of the surplus spirit from its
Sydney distillery for the tractors on its Fiji
plantations. The slight technical alterations
necessary for the change from petrol to spirit
were effected without difficulty. With alco-
hol in general use as a motor fuel in Aus-
tralia, there would be a new industry to en-
gage thousands, and millions of pounds now
sent out of the country to pay for petrol
and benzine would be kept here.
* * * *
“Morton” ; From time to time Australian
newspapers publish messages purporting to
come from San Francisco, stating that an
Australian millionaire named Michael Hayes
has died in California leaving a fortune esti-
mated at £500,000 or £600,000 to his heirs
in Australia, who are asked to come forward
and claim it. Michael Hayes has been “re-
cently dead” for the last 16 years, so he must
be nearly defunct by this time. The heirs have
been coming forward in such numbers that
there is now quite an army of them. There
must be a string to it somewhere. What
is it?
* * * *
“Trefex”: Carelessness and slapdash
methods of handling our wool-clip in the
country are responsible for much error and
a great deal of loss. Apart from the un-
intelligent treatment of the staple itself, the
faulty description and the misdescription of
bale contents, the discrepancies between brand
and specification, the error of numbering, the
faulty packing and divers other inaccuracies
are serious and expensive matters. To
detect, rectify and advise the owners of these
things costs each woolbroker, on an average,
about a thousand pounds every season. As
there are ten woolbrokers in Sydney, that
is a cost of £lO,OOO in this centre alone —
a big price to pay for casualness. And the
joke of it is that the owner of the wool
more often than not is annoyed to have his
mistakes pointed out to him; suspicious Mr.
Cocky generally believes it is another scheme
to relieve him of some of his just profits.
* * * *
“Hartwell Conder” To the writer, as one
of the timbermen who, according to “J.P.,”
murder trees and oppose Mr. Irby, the
Conservator in Tasmania, recent references
to Finns insignis in The Bulletin are of
special interest. It is somewhat childish of
the Conservator to produce special samples
of the timber and say what wonderful wood
it is. It all depends on prevailing con-
ditions. If Finns insignis is grown where
other timbers are scarce and there is a
population to use it, it can be made to show
handsome profits. Here on the Tas. West
Coast nearly all the forest is over-mature
myrtle, and useless. Cut it down and burn
it off, and gum and blackwood grow up
automatically with wonderful rapidity. The
growth of blackwood along the Mt. Lyel)
railway is an object-lesson. Blackwood can
be exported profitably and gum is service-
able for local work. If pine legs were given
free to the mills, they could no more be
milled profitably for export than can the
myrtle itself. The folly of starting pine
plantations in such a locale was only one
of a few blunders of inexperience which Tas-
mania can ill afford.
* * * »
“M.S.” : The cockies will be able to walk
nearly a thousand feet between the first and
last letters of the legend “Australian-made”
(twice repeated) that decorates the outside
of the Great White Train which steamed
out of Sydney a few days ago on a six-
months’ cruise of N. S. Wales, and if they
do the journey on the inside of the monster
they should come out at the other end
with some fresh ideas about this country’s
ability to make its own. Elegantly dis-
played in the 16 exhibition coaches —there
are sleeping and dining carriages, a radio
station and a movie theatre as well—is a
multitude of beautifully-finished articles,
from Beale's pianos to Henderson’s hats, and
from the steel products of the B.H.P. to
the timber products of Australian Forests,
Ltd. The wireless outfit and the biograph
are Australian-made, and so is the big engine
—said to be the largest in the Common-
wealth —which drags the collection. But
it is a melancholy fact that after the thing
has ambled up to Queensland’s frontier and
looked over the back fence of Victoria, its
usefulness has ended. The fool-politicians
who. built our railways with their maddening
breaks of gauge have made the splendid ad,
a prisoner of the Ma State,

“H.K.”: November 1 marked the 133rd
anniversary of the arrival in Sydney Harbor
of the first vessel under a foreign flag—the
Philadelphia, from America, loade'd with
urgently-needed provisions for the infant
settlement.
A son of Marcus Clarke has died in Mel-
bourne. His mother was a daughter of
John Dunn, one of Melbourne’s leading
mummers in the ’sixties and ’seventies, and
herself a popular actress. She survived
Marcus nearly 30 years, in her later days
being a Registrar of Births and Deaths in
Melbourne.
“W.G.L.”: Coming in on the electric tram
my attention wandered from the election news
to the knees of the flapper opposite. The
conductor noticed the direction my eyes
were taking, and cut in morosely: “The way
these girls dress nowadays a man can’t
keep his mind on his work. It ought to be
put in the next log submitted to the Arbitra-
tion Court for an increase.”
“Crossed the continent with stock from
North to South more times than any other
man” was the claim of Stuart Field, lately
dead in Adelaide. His 72 years were practi-
cally all given to the pastoral industry. Like
Simpson Newland, he started in the
Encounter Bay district of S.A., at the mouth
of the Murray, and he was associated with
the pastoralist-novelist in various holdings on
the Darling.
“Black Tracker”: Following a drunken
spree, a man who was described by the ser-
geant as the filthiest he had ever seen was
arrested in a northern S.A. town. His con-
dition was such that he could not be brought
into court, but was dealt with in the cells.
His swag was carried out on a stable fork and
deposited on the manure heap. When the man
came out he asked for the bundle, but it
had been carted away with the manure. It
was eventually traced lying on a field ready
to be ploughed in. The man handled it
affectionately, and after exposing a heap of
black rags brought to light a black canvas
bag. It contained £260 in notes.
Arthur Kaines, Adelaide manager of the
Commercial Bank of Australia, died last
week in Melbourne. One of a well-known
S.A. tennis-playing family, he joined the
bank as a youth, was at Broken Hill in
the earliest days, and in Melbourne worked
up to an inspectorship, returning to his old
home in 1918 as manager. Musically in-
clined, he sang bass in the Anglican Cath-
edral in Melbourne and in the Orpheus
Society in Adelaide. Taken ill on a recent
pleasure visit to the Cold Land, he re-
ceived from London experts what was prac-
tically a death-sentence, and hastened back
to end his days in Australia.
“Meriis”: “Ice-cream Jimmy” was as
considerate a husband as ever joined the
A.1.F., for, in addition to leaving his missus
a flourishing ice-cream and cool-drink busi-
ness, he allotted her the whole of his pay,
and embarked for the scene of the disturb-
ance with only ss. in his pocket. But Jimmy
understood high finance. The canteen on
the transport was opened for one hour
daily, and on the first morning he invested
all his capital in cigarettes. In the after-
noon, when his mates ran short of fags, he
sold out at a profit of one penny per packet,
and the next day he bought up again. The
Diggers were quite willing to pay for the
privilege of avoiding the queue at the can-
teen, and Jimmy added chocolates and one
or two other lines as his capital increased.
And he prospered, for trading conditions
were ideal —no competition, and no dead
stock. At the end of the voyage his ss.
had grown to £5O, and this later formed the
capital of that very lucrative concern,
Desert Crown and Anchor, Unlimited.
“Ben Zine”: When the easy-won gold was
getting scarce on the West Coast of the
Shaky Isles many schemes were tried to keep
the pot boiling. One that was a success was
worked by old Honeybee. He prospected a
few remote places, and then whispered it
to those he knew would spread his secret
that he was “making a drop of whisky” in
one of the back gullies. One day he appeared
in the chief of the digging centres, and
went into a pub, where he soon had the ear
of the landlord. He produced from an old
sack a kettle and asked for a glass to let
Bung sample his product. “Grand! Like
mother’s milk!”—this from Bung. Advance
of a tenner? Yes, all right. Not a word to
be whispered. And off old Honeybee went
to work the oracle on another cheap-whisky
purchaser. He did the town’s 20-odd pubs,
and only one didn’t fall to the tempter. He
collected about £2OO and then moved on. The
splendid sample he had was part of a gallon
of overproof he had bought from a local
wine-and-spirit merchant.
“S.S.S.’s” little picture of Papua:—
So Dan Pryke has passed over! Great men, the
Prykes! I happened across them on the Lakekamu
Ranges. The position was a little delicate. I, a
girl, had been sent up to do a man’s work at the
improvised hospital on the new rush. Later on one
forenoon Mr. Assistant-Magistrate called in at the
hospital and said I was bidden to tea at the Pryke
brothers’ claim up the creek. About 10 miles and
he’d call for me at mid-day to-morrow. A squelchy
tramp through 10 miles of mud and scrub-itch
and thick undergrowth at tropic mid-day made
adventurous voyaging. The police boys in new uni-
forms were very pleased with themselves and ran races
with the hospital boys; and that helped me through.
Suddenly the jungle orchestra of cicadas and queer
tropical bird-calls ceased in a startling silence, and
over the illimo treetops Melba soared out in the
Jewel Song. I listened entranced: I thought I must
have died and waked. “Getting near,” said Mr.
A.-R.M. “About an#ther mile.” The brothers were
away at the claim when we arrived, and Mr. Magis-
trate went off to fetch them. I sat near the tent
and fairly revelled in the £2OO gramophone with
scores of grand-opera records. A big enamelled
wash-basin in the middle of the table full of gold
fascinated me. There it smiled, hundreds of pounds’
worth. When the brothers arrived they told me that
no man on the field would dream of touching an-
other man’s gold. It wasn’t done. They feasted me
on tea and soft drinks and chocolates and cherry-
ripe cake and olives and asparagus-such things as
make a Papuan lady-tea. Then I was taken round
the claim and shown the miles and miles of water-
ways and sluices and dams. After which I went
back to the camp and laved my hands in the bowl
of gold and held up handfuls of it and let it trickle
through my fingers. New Guinea gold is not a
poor man’s gold: it takes money to finance it, and
strong men. I never met finer than the Prykes:
nor has anyone.

Neither arctic winters nor tropical rainy seasons keep General
Motors cars out of service. Above is a drawing from a photo-
graph of Hans Osterman, in the Buick with which he won the
annual Winter Race across Sweden this year. At right: From
a photograph of a General Motors car travelling over flooded
country in Argentina during the rainy season.
What makes motor car value?
1L Utility
JLHE beautiful lines and handsome
bodies of General Motors cars are
admired on the boulevards of all the
world’s capitals. But it is essentially
for their utility—for their service on
all sorts of roads and in all sorts of
weather that General Motors cars
are accepted as standard in each price
class.
The open models are built and
finished for all year service. They come
equipped for instant and easy change
into dry and snug shelters for driving
in rainy or wintry weather. And their
Duco finishes are weather and wear-
proof.
The closed models, with their beau-
tiful and comfortable Fisher bodies, are
the last word in motor car utility; they
have fittingly been called out-door
homes. And it is now possible to pur-
chase closed models of General Motors
cars for the price once asked for open
models.

Can You Tell the Cause
of Your Trouble?
y
Are you sometimes discouraged and
think you’ll never get any better?
Can you tell what is the matter
with you, or what makes you sick? Do
you know that about nine-tenths of all
sickness is caused by Kidney Trouble?
Have you ever stopped to think that
your kidneys may be the cause of
your poor health?
Most people do not realise how
much work the kidneys are required to
do every day.
Every drop of blood in the body
must pass through and be filtered by
the kidneys thousands of times a day.
How can they do their work well if
they are sick ?
If your kidneys need treatment, DR.
SHELDON’S GIN PILLS, the Won-
derful Kidney Remedy, will prove to
be just the medicine you need.
“Dr. Sheldon's Gin Pills are wonder-
ful for Backache and Kidney Trouble.
Since taking them the pains in my
back have completely gone.”

Kidneys are the most wonderful remedy yet devised for

Pills for Backache and Kidneys is such that it is
practically impossible to take them into the human
system without results. They start to work the minute
you take them, and they help you from the first time
that you use them. Dr, Sheldon’s Gin Pills for Back-

Uncle John and Uncle Joe.
[For The Bulletin.]
OH, great and good was Uncle John,
A pattern of propriety,
Whose seemly life was built upon
A sane and sweet sobriety.
Of many words and wise withal
That weighty man imparted me
These only now 1 can recall
(The rest long since departed me),
These, heard with warm months yet to run:
“The best o’ the summer’s past, my son.”
A rare, sad rip was Uncle Joe,
The Devil sure was free of him;
At least, ’twas rumor had it so,
For little did we see of him.
A scallywag, whose soul was sunk
In every sin forbidden him,
Shiftless and poor and mostly drunk —•
Such vices long had ridden him.
But this he said, when skies were sad :
“The worst o’ the winter’s over, lad.’”
Rich Uncle John, poor Uncle Joe!
Can any tell with clarity
Why one should deal untempered woe,
And one unwise hilarity?
And now they’re dead. Good Uncle John,
By reason of his piety,
To highest Heaven’s surely gone;
There will he show variety?
Or cry, to each new glory won :
“The best o’ the splendor’s past, my son”?
And Uncle Joe, poor, foolish wight,
For all the horrid sins of him,
To Hell, no doubt, has travelled light,
With nothing but the grins of him
For comfort on his dreadful pyre;
As swift they shovel coal on him
And ever leaps the eager fire,
That scamp will say (my soul on him!)
To one in equal torment clad:
“The worst o’ the trouble’s over, lad.”

HASEN.
The Midnight Twins.
[For The Bulletin.]
I LIKED school, but I did not; like Mon-
day mornings. Neither did the other
boys. The youthful spirits were not as
buoyant as usual as we trudged along - the
winding track by the river, with dinner-bags
and books; and Cobb’s barn, with its empty
straddles on each side of what we called the
schoolroom, looked big and dull. When the
straddles were filled with maize they were
reminders of wearying homework —husking
and threshing, and sewing bags. Every boy
—and girl, too —had that sort of homework
at harvest time, and some of them in busy
seasons were kept away from school for
weeks. Our Monday mornings were not as
bad as that, and consequently none of us
liked missing a day.
Phegan, the teacher, told us we ought to be
fresh and lively after our week-end spell from
lessons. But the week-end was pretty stren-
uous for most of us. We worked all Satur-
day, or perhaps we rode to town, ten miles
away, on errands; and on Sunday, when we
weren’t hunting wallabies or “minding cock-
atoos,” we tramped around lagoons and
swamps, and through the bush and jungle,
carrying the game and ammunition for our
elders.
Phegan was seldom very bright on Mon-
day. He went to town on Saturday on_ busi-
ness and for relaxation among old friends.
On Sunday he was rarely abroad until the
afternoon, unless there was a meeting of far-
mers for a picnic or a battue somewhere.
On Monday he was rather bilious.
We judged by Phegan’s eyes at morning
drill what sort of humor he was in. Dull
and frowning meant storms. A small attend-
ance on Monday was a bad sign, too, since
Phegan’s income fluctuated with the number
of pupils he had. Seeing that he was in a
grumpy mood, we worked and behaved with
particular care, knowing that the cane fell
heavily and on the slightest provocation
when he was cranky.
We had taken our places at the desks,
and books and slates were being passed
along, when Mrs. Paddy Midnight walked
in, leading a boy and a girl by the hands.
It was a happy diversion. We were always
glad to see visitors when Phegan was not
in a pleasant mood. They took his atten-
tion off us, if they did not always modify
him to our liking.
The two youngsters were about 10 years
old, and of the same coal-black complexion
as our old school-mate Peter Possum. The
girl wore a clean print frock of a red-and-
white pattern, but the boy had only a short
shirt. He was shy, and gazed about the
academy with a look of awe in his smoky
eyes. His mother was a plump and comely
gin, and wore elastic-side boots without
stockings.
“You the schoolmaster?” she inquired.
“Yes,” said Phegan. frowning at the group.
“What do you want?”
“My husban’, Paddy—you know Paddy?”
queried Mrs. Midnight.
“No, I don’t,” said Phegan shortly.
“He work for George Cobb now,” she
explained. “Me work for Mrs. Cobb, an’
you learn piccaninny to read paper-yabber.”
“Who told you that?” asked Phegan a
little sharply.
“Boss tell me send ’em to school,” she re-
plied.
“I see,” said Phegan. “Who’s paying for
them? The fee is one shilling a week for
each child.”
“Boss pay you that,” she told him. Then
she hauled her progeny from behind her
skirts and stood them together. “These two
feller twins.”
“Hm!” said Phegan. “What’s the girl’s
name?”
“Bridget Midnight,” said her mother.
Phegan looked surprised. “And what is
the boy’s?”
“Terence Midnight,” was the reply.
A faint titter came from Sarah Cobb in
the third class. She had heard her father,
a good-natured man who was fond of a joke,
advise the gin that the teacher would be
pleased if she gave them those names for
school purposes. Phegan took hold of his
beard and stared at Bridget and Terence
as if he didn’t quite know what to make of
them. After a while he said: “We’ll call
them Biddy and Terry. But you take the
boy home and put trousers on him.”
“What for trousers?” the gin questioned.
“Boys can’t come to this school without
their trousers,” said Pliegan sternly. Then
he led Biddy to a seat at the bottom of the
infant class, and the work of the day pro-
ceeded. Terry appeared later clothed in a
pair of old knickers that wore several sizes
too large for him, and with a saddle-strap
buckled round his waist to take in the
slack.
With the aid of a large alphabet-card
Phegan tested them as to whether they knew
anything about letters, pausing awhile as lie
pointed to each before telling them what it
was. Terry’s ignorance was unrelieved by a
glimmer of intelligence until he came to J.
“That fish-hook!” he said with sudden
animation.
“Funny-looking fish-hook,” drawled Fhe-
gan, glancing at Biddy.
“Little-feller pickaxe,” was her idea of it.
“No,” growled Phegan. “That’s the letter
,T. Say J.”
“Chay,” responded Biddy. “Tjay,” echoed
Terry.
K and L met with blank looks, but at M
Terry brightened up again.
“That yarraman—four-feller leg,” he said.
“What!” cried Phegan, astonished. “Does
that look like a horse?”
“That the way blackfeller make him on
message-stick,” Terry explained.
“This is the English alphabet, not a black-
fellow’s message-stick,” said Phegan. “And
that is the letter M. Understand that?”
“Yowi.”
“Don’t say yowi. Say yes, sir.”
“l r assar,” responded Terry.
“Not yassar. Yes, sir-r,” Phegan shouted
at him.
“Yes, serrah,” Terry shouted back to him.
Phegan shook his head and half-danced
with impatience, unaware that in speaking
with emphasis he was putting a burr on the
end of the word. While his eye was off
them a gild next to Biddy whispered the right
pronunciation, and saved them from a dead-
lock. The- lesson proceeded then until they
got to S.
“That snake,” said Terry.
“Sugh!” said Phegan, turning from him to
Biddy.
“Wire hook to hang up billycan,” was
Biddy’s guess.
At that point Phegan wheeled sharply and
shook his stick at the other classes. “If I
hear any more tittering and giggling down
there,” he threatened, “I’ll give the lot of
you something that will make you wriggle.
Sit up, Era Green. If your thick head’s too
heavy I’ll get you a prop.”
Then the lesson proceeded in a more pep-
pery manner, whilst we bent over our work as
if we loved it, and did not look up again at
Biddy and Terry.
At playtime the mob was inclined to make
fun of the newcomers, till Mary Irvin, a kind
and gentle-natured girl, took little black
Biddy under her protection. Then everybody
made friends with her. As for Terry, he
found a mate of his own race in Peter Pos-
sum, who had been as long as any of us at
the school. Peter had always been treated
as an equal. Ilaving been reared by whites
from his infancy, he never went into blacks’
camps, nor associated with any of the tribe.
He was near the top of the second class.
Terry was interested in a bit of painting
that Phegan was doing. With some tar in
a fruit-tin and a brush made with a bit of
rag tied round a stick, he was re-painting the
sign over the front of the barn-scliool.
“What name that one?” he asked Peter.
“P-U-B-L-I-C—Public,” said Peter, spell-
ing the first word.
“Oh!” said Terry. “This public house?”
“No, public school,” Peter corrected.
Phegan was standing on a ricketty ladder.
Terry stood with one foot on the bottom
rung, intently watching him. The girls were
playing chasings round the barn. One
bumped against Terry, who in turn bumped
the ladder, and Phegan upset the tar, which
spilled over his waistline and streamed down
to his boots. With an angry snort, he slipped
off the ladder and looked round for Terry
and a waddy at the same time.
“Where’s that black imp?” he demanded.
“Bring him, here to me.”
Terry had darted round the corner and
crawled under the barn. The straddle at
each end was floored with slabs, but the
floor of the schoolroom between them was
bare earth. Peter and Biddy tried to coax
him out.
“Come on, Terry; he won’t touch you,”
said Peter. “Hurry up, school’s goin’ in
now.”
“No fear!” said Terry. “Schoolmaster
saucy feller.”
Biddy talked to him in her own lingo,
but he would not budge. Phegan came
round, mumbling savagely about the sticki-
ness of himself, and peered under the floor.
“Come out here, you black scamp, or I’ll
haul you out,” he cried.
“No more school, boss,” answered Terry.
“Me finish.”
“By the holy smoke,” said Phegan, get-
ting up, “I'll finish you!”
He blew a fierce blast with his whistle,
and we were marched into school, all looking
as solemn as owls, and nobody daring to
look at the tarred teacher, who walked as
if he had stiff legs.
“You two boys,” he said, addressing
Johnny Cobb and Ern Green, “lift the slabs
and drag that brumby out.”
While the rest of us were trying to keep
our minds on lessons, the two boys made a
great clatter behind ns with the slabs. Terry
shifted away as each one was raised, until
nearly half the floor had been taken up. At
last they got him in a corner, and he was
dragged out in a smother of dust and cob-
webs. Terry was both frightened and muti-
nous, and had to be half-carried to his seat.
Phegan stood over him, cane in hand; but
he only rapped the desk with the flagellator.
“See here, my boy,” he said, “it’s not my
custom to chastise anyone on his first day
at school. But mark this: if I have any
more of your silly pranks I’ll put totem
marks all over you.”
Terry did not grasp the full text of

“Every Picture
Tells a S tory'
What causes
Aching Joints?
Much of the pain attributed to rheumatism is
really due to an excess of uric acid in the blood
caused by weak kidneys.
When excess uric acid col-
lects in the blood it forms
jagged crystals, which are de-
posited in the muscles, joints,
along the walls of the arteries,
and in the sheaths of nerves.
The movement of a nerve or
muscle that contains these uric-
acid crystals causes sharp, in-
tense, darting pains, and in time
starts swelling and inflammation
of the joints.
The moment you feel any
rheumatic pains—any twinges
or uneasiness in the back—any
sign of urinary irregularity, be-
gin with Doan’s Backache Kid-
ney Pills. This medicine aids
the kidneys to filter excess uric
acid out of the blood, and has
been winning successes for over
fifty years.
SERIOUS KIDNEY TROUBLE
CURED.
Mrs. F. Schroder, Oberon Cottage, 14
Oberon Street, Randwick, Sydney, says:
“For a good while a member of my
family suffered from rheumatism and
backache. The pain was often so severe
that it was torture to move about,
especially stooping. We felt sure the
kidneys were not working properly, as
there were several other marked symp-
toms noticeable, but backache and rheu-
matism were by far the most painful.
One day Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
were recommended to us, so I sent for
some, and I am pleased to tell you
they acted splendidly, three bottles
making a complete cure. Some years
have elapsed since then, but there has
been no return of the trouble, so we
feel safe in saying the cure is a perma-
nent one.”
Six years later, Mrs. Schroder says:
“The cure referred to still holds good,
a fact that speaks volumes for Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. . They are a
splendid kidney medicine and will
always have our hearty recommenda-
tion.”
Sold at 2/9 per bottle at all

TWO RESIDENTS OF SYDNEY CURED OF
PILES BY DOAN’S OINTMENT.
A KENSINGTON CASE.
Mr. Joseph Abrahams, senior, No. 29
Anzac Parade, Kensington, Sydney,
says: “For years I was tortured with
itching piles. The irritation of this ail-
ment is terrible, and only those who
have suffered know how awful it is. I
used dozens of pile remedies, but could
not get anything to give me ease. A
friend urged me to try Doan’s Oint-
ment, saying he was sure this prepara-
tion would cure me. I got some and
commenced using it, and in a very short
time I was completely cured.”
Nine years later Mr. Abrahams says:
“I have not been troubled with Piles
since Doan’s Ointment cured me over
nine years ago. I have advised many
sufferers to use this grand remedy, and
I am sure it will cure in every case if
people will only apply it properly.”
AN UNDERCLIFFE CASE.
Mr. F. W. Martin, Homer Street,
Undercliffe, Sydney, says: “For about
12 months I was tortured with Itching
Piles, aad the pain and irritation nearly
drove me mad. I consulted a doctor,
and used Pile remedies, but could not
get permanent relief. I heard that
Doan’s Ointment was good, and decided
to try it. After a few applications I
felt better, and by the time the third
pot was finished I was perfectly cured.
I advise all those who suffer with Piles
to use Doan’s Ointment, as I am sure
they will benefit by it.”
Eleven years later Mr. Martin says:
“Eleven years ago I told you Doan’s
Ointment had cured me of Piles. I
can now add that my cure has lasted,
for I am still free of this torturing
ailment. I always keep Doan’s Oint-
ment in the house, and use it occasion-
ally, just as a preventive against any
return.”
SOLD BY ALL CHEMISTS AND STORES AT 2/9 PER TIN.
Phegan’s ultimatum, but he knew what
totem marks were, and he stared in a half-
dazed way with parted lips and eyes that
were as round as saucers. He glanced
stealthily at the door, as if he had half a
mind to bolt; but little Biddy laid a com-
forting hand on his arm, and lie settled down
to work, making strokes which he called
spears and yam-sticks on a slate.
Sarah Cobb was put in charge whilst
Phegan went away to get rid of the tar,
and we didn’t see him again till dinner-time.
That helped to steady Terry’s nerves, but
it did not dispel his sullen looks. He scowled
all day, thinking much of the time about the
totem marks he had been promised.
When we were dismissed that afternoon
lie went to the woodlieap, where his father
was chopping sticks with a tomahawk.
“You read paper yabber now?” asked
Paddy.
“No fear, baal me!” said Terry.
“What I send you to school for?” de-
manded Paddy. “What you learn to-day?”
“A, B, C and yessir,” answered Terry.
“School no good,” he added. “Boss belonga
that place saucy feller.”
Paddy only laughed, and went on chopping
sticks. Terry went to his mother, who
laughed more than Paddy, and told Mrs.
Cobb. From that he concluded that he had
been abandoned unreservedly to the terrors
of school. For the rest of the evening he sat
apaiC and sulked.
Next day Biddy was in her place at roll-
call, looking bright and clean, with her hair
brushed and plaited like the white girls.
Terry was absent, but it was learnt that
Paddy was chasing him through tlie corn and
brush, and would bring him along as soon
as lie was caught.
He arrived half an hour late, with a dog-
chain padlocked round liis ankles. Paddy
carried him in and dumped him on bis seat
with a force that shook the furniture. For
once Phegan was dumb. It was a new experi-
ence for him, and though he eyed the rebel
with a frown there was a lurking smile of
satisfaction behind it.
Terry remained in hobbles all day, the joke
of the school. But the shackles proved a
better corrective than Phegan’s cane.

THE dull black barrel of the rifle across
his knees, his back leaning against
a spur of the giant fig that interlaced
its branches through the roof of the jungle
above him, the shell of a man that had been
Harry 'Calvert sat gazing into the light-green
foliage of the sapling cedar.
“God r
Scarcely louder than a breath, the ejacu-
lation was yet softly audible in the silence.
Sharply the shy black-and-gold bird in the
cedar bobbed its head up and explored the
gloomy scrub with quick, darting glances.
Calvert sat perfectly still, and, satisfied, the
bird drew its polished head down again and
continued its shallow sleep.
Calvert wanted to cough, but a regent-
bird was something entirely new to him,
and the fascination of its beauty helped un-
consciously to restrain his lungs. It had
been described to him as a black-and-gold
bird that he could not possibly mistake, be-
cause it was the only thing of that coloring
on the island. He had expected it to be
larger, haying a vague, masculine idea that
only big birds were used in the decoration of
women’s hats. He coupled feminine head-
gear with egrets and ostriches, and, having
never seen an egret, imagined the two to be
much the same size. Pie certainly had not
anticipated that any arrangement of black
and gold patches could produce an effect of
such haunting loveliness. And he had been
told that there were scores of regent-birds
on the island waiting to be shot for the glori-
fication of Woman.
Silently he fingered the lock of the rifle.
One pound each, and a whole fifteen hundred
acres of unharvested jungle to shoot them in.
It was too easy; picking up money. “Scliood
darm in der botee; ve want der het in-
dacd,” the wall-eyed German had said. Cal-
vert grinned grimly. He, an English ex-
soldier, shooting Australian birds for a Ger-
man to export to France! It epitomised the
truth of all wars and all peace. It was rich;
superbly rich. But the option had been pick-
ing paspalum-seed for a Hindoo; and the
German was at least white. As far as he
knew the man wasn’t a bad sort, anyway.
He’d trusted him with the rifle and a week’s
provisions and the job—yes, decidedly the
job! That was more than anyone else had
been game enough—game was the right word
—to trust him with since he came out to
the new country and headed for the Northern
rivers because a steward on the Euripides
had told him that the north coast of New
South Wales was not unlike his own Mid-
lands. Earlier he would have said “gener-
ous enough,” and at that time the uneasy
way in which the owners of the small cow-
farms regarded him was amusing until get-
ting a job became a really serious matter.
It was left to the German to hit the truth.
“Ach !” he had said, “you are like a
tamn ghosd. Id iss der burying eggpense
vat schooes ’em off. You vauder go nord,
my poy—a tamn long vay nord.”
He saw himself after that in a mirror
the German ruthlessly thrust in front of
him, and he started to cough at once at the
mere suggestion of the ghastly thing that
his face had become.
He cocked the rifle. The guarded click
was scarcely perceptible to his own ears, but
the bird thirty yards away jerked its head
up again and inspected the sunless surround-
ings minutely. Its head bobbed about with
quick movements. Without flicking an eye-
lash Calvert watched it; he had not sniped
from the olive grove at Ilelles for nothing.
Pie had learnt the art of sitting still very
young, before he was twenty. It didn’t seem
eight years ago.
But something more than the mere art
of a sniper influenced him now—something
about the bobbing head that made misty stir-
rings in his brain. Swiftly the mental
canvas took definite shapes. As if she had
stepped out from the clean white bark of
the cedar, the girl stood clear-cut in the
foreground. She had that sort of way with
her hands, quick, jerky, impulsive. There
was more than that,. He remembered the
full-mourning dress she had worn for her
brother in 1917; recalled how the black
suited her fresh, peach-blossom cheeks and
her gold hair—and—her —gold—hair !
Exactly! The black-and-gold creature in
the tree ivas like her, astonishingly like her.
Her gold hair gleamed like that brilliant
patch, not so much when it was plaited and
twisted above her ears as when it was spread
out on her back drying in the soft English
sunshine after her mother had washed it. Too
much for her to wash unhelped; far too
much! It completely covered her back to
well below her waist, a golden cascade. He
had put his hand out and stroked it; the
soft, silken feel of it!
He tilted the rifle round nearly in line
with the bird. Just a swift lift, a tug at the
trigger and he would have it—£l in the bag.
Pie couldn’t miss; it was easy money. It
was more than that now; even the thought
of it, the idea of watching the black-and-gold
thing hurtling to the ground, was satisfying.
The thought crossed his mind that she had
been right; the last few months had proved
that. Feminine intuition might have told
her how the next visit to the doctor would
pan out. He had heard of such instinctive
foresight and was satisfied to take as read
anything at all attributed to the inscrutable
sex. But, all the same, he had never been
able to bury the feeling that it had been
mere cold-blooded callousness.
He had told her everything the doctor
said; simply: “We cannot always say, with
these gas cases; you might be developing
T. 8., and you might not. But I think 1
can be sure in six months’ time. Come back
then.” She had cried real tears, big, clear
drops that fell warm and wet on his hands.
He had comforted her, jumped over the low
hedge near Bunyan’s cottage and back again
to show her he was as fit as a fiddle, and
had taken the express that night from Bed-
ford with the idea that he was going to be
in London, away from her, for a whole
grudging week. He had thought the days
of the six months would drag, but they
hadn’t; viewed retrospectively, they had gone
like lightning from the moment he found
the small brown package in the office rack.
For a while the little gold ring with the
four diamonds set in platinum had lain on
his hand, burning like a splinter of ice.
Then he had put it into his top right-hand
vest pocket and read the one-page letter.
She was bitterly sorry ; she was heartbroken ;
but—well, she had asked Dr. Holland her-
self, and, though he had said the things she
had heard already, they hadn’t seemed quite
the same. She had told her mother. They
had talked it over (her mother and father),
and they thought it would be better
llis right hand crept from the rifle-butt
and felt in his vest-pocket. It was still
there. Grimly his hand went back to the
butt of the rifle. Yes, it would be satisfy-
ing to shoot the black-and-gold thing in
the cedar. At one time he had felt like
shooting himself; that was when he strode
out of the office and watched the black
water oozing past Westminster below the
bridges until nearly midnight. But he soon
got over that foolishness. He saw through
her beauty to the cold, calculating image
within. Soon that was the only image he
had of her. Even the glimpse of her that
the black-and-gold bird had thrust upon him
a few seconds ago was already forgotten in
the bitterness of that image of heartlessness
which dogged him even here.
He had not seen a doctor after the six
months; that did not matter now. But he
knew what the verdict would have been had
lie done so. The winter out on the coastal
roads, the drenchings under the trees where
he had huddled and shivered a prayer for
dawn, and the red streaks when he coughed
and spat left no doubts about that. He had
felt better since summer came; much better.
A week or two shooting regent-birds at a
pound a head would do the trick, would get
him where he wanted to go—as far north
into Queensland as possible before the next
winter came.
The thought of winter frightened him a
little, but he shook off the fear. He knew
that when he had put a bullet through the
bird in the sapling he would feel altogether
better. The increasing strength of the morn-
ing sunshine was beginning to invade the
jungle in a subtle, vague sort of way, show-
ing out more clearly the gold-and-black sheen
of the sleeping bird. Gold and black! He
owed those colors something. Vividly he
wondered what she would think if she could
picture him there. It would please her for
having dropped him, no doubt. She could
shrug those soft, silk-covered shoulders of
hers and laugh a bitter-sweet laugh of satis-
faction. “Calvert? Lieutenant Calvert? Oh,
lie’s on a jungle-covered island out in Aus-
tralia, shooting pretty birds for a German
to send to the milliners in Paris!”
His mind was running on vividly, so
vividly that he fancied he could hear her
silvery, tinkling laugh coming through the
jungle; but it was only a soft breeze rust-
ling the sweeping fronds of the bangalows.
■ He glanced again at the black and gold
creature enjoying its equivalent of forty-
winks among the light green leaves. Well,
he would be like her, like the cold image that
was all he had left of her, a destroyer, a
wrecker of what was worth while in life.
A thin shaft of light, slanting in through
an unguarded crevice in the roof of the
jungle, played full upon the bird, bathing
it in a rich light that seemed unearthly in
that ghostly semi-gloom. For the second
time since the black and gold thing had flut-
tered into the cedar, scarcely half a minute
after he had sat down at the foot of the fig,
the fascinating beauty of the polished crea-
ture tugged at the misty curtains of his mem-
ory. It hurried him back, blotting out the
intermediate mind pictures. He could see
nothing now but the girl, sitting out in the
English sunshine, with her head bent over
a book and the shimmering cascade of gold
falling down her back; nothing but her un-
utterable, unattainable loveliness. Un-
attainable
He lifted the rifle sharply. The shot shat-
tered the silence. A streak of black and
gold darted out from the cedar and flashed
on. noise scared, through the jungle.
But Calvert had not missed.
