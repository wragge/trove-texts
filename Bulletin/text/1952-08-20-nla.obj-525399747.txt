GLAMIS CASTLE, SCOTLAND’S LOVELIEST BARONIAL HALL
GLAMIS CASTLE, near Forfar, in North East Scotland, is the seat ot
the Earl of Strathmore and was the childhood home of Her Majesty me
Queen Mother, whose father, the late Earl, was the fourteenth of the fine
of Strathmore and Kinghorne. . . c ... . , - torv
This magnificent castle has played an important part in Scottish history,
and from a remote period it was a favourite Royal hunting lodge. Legena
asserts that the stone chamber in the castle, known as Duncan s Hall, was
the scene where Macbeth, “Thane of Cawdor, Lord of Glamis, King ot
Scotland,” murdered Duncan, but the castle, as it exists today, was built
mainly between 1671 and 1689. Traces of an earlier fourteenth-century
castle however, still exist in the crypt and dungeons of the present structure.
King Malcolm 11, in 1033, after being wounded by an assassin s arrow
on the neighbouring “Hunter’s Hill,” returned to Glamis, where he died.
From the eleventh to the fourteenth century the castle was a Royal residence,
but in 1372 King Robert II created Glamis a barony and gave it as a dowry
to his daughter on her marriage to Sir John Lyon. About 1445 a grandson
of this marriage became the first Lord Glamis, a title which now ranks
amongst the oldest of Scottish baronies. Alter his death James V of Scotland
determined to secure his estate, and in order to do so the widow. Lady
Glamis, was accused of treason and witchcraft and burnt at the stake on
Castle Hill in Edinburgh. Her son, Lord Glamis, a boy of 16, was also
sentenced to death, but this sentence was not earned out, although he was
imprisoned and his estates forfeited. Thereafter, until his death, King James
lived at Glamis Castle and held court there with his queen, Mary of Lorraine
and their daughter Mary* later Queen of Scots. After the K.ing s death in
1542 the property was restored to the rightful heir. Twenty years later
Mary Queen of Scots rested at Glamis on her way north to break Huntley s
rebellion in 1562 The menu of their dinner is still in existence, written in
manuscript 1 by the French secretary. In 1677 Patrick Lyon became
the first Earl of Strathmore.

BOSWELLIANA.
I should think that Norman Lindsay’s
verdict on Boswell in Holland —that it is
disappointing after the London Journal,
but nevertheless entertaining because
nothing that Boswell Writes can fail to
convey something of the exuberance of
his personality—will be the universal
opinion on this second instalment of the
great literary treat of the century.
Until I reached the love-letters at the
end my own opinion was that the
material was really too thin to make a
book for the general reader; and I
inclined darkly to the suspicion that the
editors of this vast mass of Boswelliana,
discovered lurking up chimneys or being
used as wrapping-paper in some out-of-
the-way shop, were going to space-out
their richest discoveries, giving us by turns
something as solid as the London Journal
and then something as weak (compara-
tively) as Boswell in Holland.
That is not altogther a fair conjecture,
since the new volume follows directly
upon the London Journal in time; and
since Professor Pottle of Yale, whose
unobtrusive, scholarly and humorous
annotations are a pleasure all the way
through, makes it clear that he has
selected the material from a mass of less-
interesting documents, deliberately offer-
ing the public only what he thinks will
make an entertaining book, and reserving
the rest for the special edition for
students.
So well, in fact, has he selected the
material —from the notes Boswell made
for the lost portion of his “Holland
Journal,” from the part of the journal
that has been recovered, and from letters
between Boswell and his contemporaries
—that he has given us not merely an
assemblage of Boswelliana but a book
which, like the London Journal, has a
theme, movement, form; a dramatic
struggle which works out like a novel.
But still the point remains: one awaits
the next volume partly in hope, partly in
fear. We don’t want too many books as
thin as this ; or at least we want to be
warned how thin they are, so that we
may read them as sidelights on Boswell,
not as the full blaze of Boswell at his
greatest.
One other criticism might be made of
the editing: the poverty of the illustra-
tions. There is an appealing sketch of
Belle de Zuylen, the heroine of Boswell’s
principal flirtation of the period ; a couple
of views of Holland ; and that is all.
Portraits of most of the other person-
alities should surely have been available ;
and one misses especially a portrait of
Boswell himself. A later sketch would
help if nothing was available from this
period ; but if there was one of the period
available it is a great pity not to have
included it: for here, as in the London
Journal, a point the reader needs con-
stantly to be reminded of is Boswell’s
youth . . . one tends to judge him, in his
moments of genius and moments of folly
alike, as if he were the mature Boswell of
the Life of Johnson; but he was 23 in
London, 24 when he was studying law in
Utrecht. If these illustrations are to be
in the limited edition it is poor publishing
tactics to withhold them from the popular
printing—though the format otherwise,
one might add, is a model of good taste
and readability.
Of course it is ultimately to Boswell,
whose natural genius has paved the way
for Professor Pottle, that credit must be
given for the form, the dramatic interest
of this slice of his life: another proof
of his innate artistry which Norman
Lindsay stressed. And so, too, it is
Boswell who must ultimately be blamed
for the comparative thinness of this
volume.
The fault does not lie so much in the
scrappiness of the daily jottings which,
until we meet the recovered portion of
the journal, replace the smoother prose
and fuller, richer descriptions of the
London Journal: these jottings, as Pro-
fessor Pottle points out, are essentially
just as interesting as the finished article
and often more lively and more revealing.
It is in the theme itself that the weakness
lies.
In the London Journal we had the
delightful story of Boswell’s affair with
Louisa, caught up in the general comedy
of a young man’s discovery of all the
genial wickedness of London. But in the
Holland episode Boswell has met Johnson,
and, possibly from that cause alone, but
more likely also because of his father's
influence, and a fear of the very distress-
ing consequences that followed some of
his amatory exploits, and a general and
deep-seated feeling that it was time he
learned to control himself for fear of
being swept off the earth altogether by
his extravagance and his melancholia—
because, no doubt, of a combination of
all these factors, the diarist has reformed.
His twofold theme is; how shall he
become a respectable, dignified young
man, fit to be the laird of Auchinleck after
his father; and how shall he conquer the
melancholia from which he has suffered
since the age of 17, and which, under the
double stress of the sodden climate of
Holland and the effort to become sober,
studious and moral, afflicts him to th
point of nervous-breakdown.
There is much human interest in thi
private-view of a Prince Hal changin
into a Henry V. There are some amusing
moments of extravagance, reminding on
of some of Byron’s heroic gestures, when
Boswell swears on his sword in the puhli
square of Utrecht never to depart from
his Inviolable Scheme of reformation or
for some reason not clearly stated, spends
the entire night naked on the floor beside
his bed with a coverlet over him. There
is often something moving in his agonie
of hypochondria. There are the stalwar;
letters of his father. There are vivic
glimpses of Boswell’s daily life and an
illuminating commentary on 18th-century
manners.
But there is also a great deal of repeti
tion. It is a sad fact that the raw young
rake of the London Journal, now abstain-
ing from amorous adventures (“Go no
to Amsterdam”), and setting himself up
as a moral adviser to young ladies of
fashion, has become rather a prig ; with
the result that his letters (particularly to
Johnson) are sententious and that, always
striving to take the correct attitude, he is
not as candid as a good autobiographer
should be.
One misses the cheerful frankness of
Pepys, who never deceived himself as
Boswell to some extent does in this
volume ; and if the portrait of the young
man desperately striving to “be Johnson”
has its own charm, one cannot help look-
ing forward to the day when Boswell will
be Boswell again.
A curious fact is that what might have
been the central theme of the volume, and
a most fascinating one —Boswell’s flirta-
tion with Belle de Zuylen (or “Zdlide,”
as he called her) —comes only near the
end, as a kind of afterthought. The lady
who most attracted Boswell in Utrecht
was the widow Geelvinc, whom, as with
so many others, he thought of marrying ;
she was a friend of Zdlide. Then, just as
he was leaving Holland to go on the tour
that took him to France and Rousseau,
Corsica and Paoli, Zelide let it be known
to Boswell that she loved him: which
instantly set him on fire with reciprocal
love, dynastic ambitions, high moral
sentiments, gratified vanity, and extreme
prudence ... so that on his subsequent
European tour he wrote Zelide a score
of astonishing love-letters alternately
hinting at marriage and hastily, in the
next paragraph, withdrawing the hint.
Eventually Boswell got to the point of
writing to Zelide’s father, asking him to
act —in the father’s amused phrase—as
“imperial arbiter” to decide whether any-
one so proud and wayward as Boswell
could ever hope to be happy in marriage
with anyone so brilliant in intellect and
bold in opinion as Zelide ... a most
astounding document to submit to a
prospective father-in-law:
Do not accuse me of being a cold and
indifferent lover. I am not the lover of
Mademoiselle de Zuylen. Had I that fever
in my soul I would not be thinking of a
calm, conjugal engagement. No. I am the
heir of an ancient family, and think
myself under obligation to prolong it, to
lead an ordered and hospitable life like
txqr ancestors before me. I see a person
who would suit me more than any I have
found, or even can well hope to find. That
person is my friend.
1 beseech you, Sir, to advise me. I
consider I am too young to marry; but
such a wife as Zelide might prove is well
worth some years of freedom. Were she
to feel a true affection for me, she has
- force enough to adapt herself in every
respect.
I should marry her, no doubt, by the forms
of the Church. But that would not be
enough for me. I should require a clear
and express agreement. I should require
an oath, taken in your presence, Sir, and
before two of her brothers, that she would
always remain faithful, that she would never
design to see, or have any exchange of
letters with, anyone of whom her husband
and brothers disapproved; and that with-
OU L- e * r approbation she would neither
publish nor cause to be acted any of bet
literary compositions; and in conclusion
she must promise never to speak against
the established religion or customs of the
country she might find herself in....T0
speak clearly, her heart is more precious
to me than her mind, and it is rather what
I hope she will become than what she
actually is that I desire to marry.
The publishers are surely justified when
they describe this long and monumentally
tactless letter as “the most outrageous
proposal any man ever made”: but of
course Boswell didn’t write it for Zelide
or her father but for posterity. He was
too frightened of Zelide’s intellect really
to want to marry her; and he took the
precaution, in the course of the letter, to
ask her father either to return it to him
or to let him take a copy of it: which is
a further reinforcement of Norman
Lindsay’s point of view, that we should
regard Boswell (at the age of 24) not as
the incredible ass he sometimes seems—
the buffoon he appeared to Macaulay—
but always as primarily an artist. Also,
of course, as a further corrective to
Macaulay, one should bear in mind the
great personal charm and visible stamp
of genius Boswell must have had to be
able to post such a letter in the con-
fidence that it would be received—as it
was—in perfect good humor.
This letter is Boswell in excelsis. It is
probably the only part of Boswell in
Holland that was intrinsically worth pub-
lishing, and it casts a retrospective glow
over the whole volume, making you feel
in the end that you really have read
something fully worth your while. If a
doubt remains—if the impression of
thinness persists—so too does the hope
that, with this volume as a weakish
successor to the London Journal and with
many-more volumes to come, Boswell
may yet to be found to have written the
greatest autobiography in the language
as well as the greatest biography, and, in
the Tour of the Hebrides, very likely the
best book of travels. If the later volumes
can recapture the gusto of the London
Journal he will be a formidable rival to
Pepys.

"Australia Writes."
The Canberra section of the Fellowship
of Australian Writers invites contribu-
tions to “Australia Writes,” an anthology
of new and recent writings to be pub-
lished next July. It will include poetry,
short stories, sketches, descriptive and
critical articles, broadcast-scripts and
essays. _No restriction of subject; pay-
ment will be made. Contributions should
be forwarded by August 31 to Mrs.
L. F, H. Rees, 50 Booroondara-street,
Canberra, A.C.T.
Reviewed Briefly.
Hobbes and His Critics: John Bowie
(Cape). The author sees Hobbes as “a
prophet of a cynical, deterministic and
utilitarian political theory, which dis-
cards the old sanctions of natural reason
reflecting a Divine order, and which re-
places it by the imposition of arbitrary
power as the price of security.” That is,
as the beginning of modern Hitlerism,
Socialism, Sovietism, and all the modern
boards and controls by which our en-
slavement is increased for our own
problematical good. Probably believing
that authoritarianism is more taken for
granted today than most people realise,
Mr. Bowie goes back to the innocence of
the seventeenth century, and calls up
Hobbes’s critical contemporaries Sh
Robert Filmer, Alexander Rosse Dr
Seth Ward, Bishop Lucy, Rev. George
Lawson, John Bramhall, John Eachard
Edward Hyde (Bail of Clarendon) and
John Whitehall—bishops, statesmen and
lawyers—and summarises their objec-
tions.
* * ♦ ♦
The Confident Years: Van Wyck
Brooks (Dent). Survey of American
writing and writers from 1885 to 1915
with overtones on Pound, Eliot, Heming-
way and Gertrude Stein which carry It
on into the present day. A central
chapter deals with the great influence
of Mencken ; and later there is much
about the Americans who gathered round
Gertrude Stein in Paris. Writers dis-
cussed include Jack London, Dreiser.
O. Henry and Eugene O’Neill. Altogether
an admirable successor to the previous
volumes in this huge history of American
letters; expert in criticism, witty in style
and vivid in its pictures of scenes, periods
and people.
* * * *
/ Break My Word: Ivor Brown
(Faber). Another of this, author’s popular
word-books ; in which he discussts, with
amusing and enlightening commentary,
such oddities of the language as “adsciti-
tious,” “bezzle,” “mifiy” and “scurry-
funge”; also finding something un-
expectedly fresh and interesting to say
about such apparently commonplace old
friends as “bald,”' “lump'' and “slate.”
* * » *
The Story of Language: Mario Pei
(Allen and Unwin). Dr. Pei will be re-
membered as the author of The World’s
Chief Languages. The present volume
was highly commended by Bernard
Shaw. In his opening chapters, dealing
with the origin of language, Dr. Pei is
rather disappointing, adopting a “hard-
headed scientific realism” which practi-
cally excludes speculation and cuts even
exploration down to a minimum. Thus
all we learn of the “ding-dong” theory is
that it sustains that there is “a mystical
correlation between sound and meaning”
and so, “like everything mystical, it is best
discarded in a serious scientific discus-
sion” ; and other theories, such as the
“pooh-pooh,” which maintains that
language first consisted of exclamations
of surprise, pain, fear, pleasure, etc., or
the “bow-wow” theory which says that
language arose in imitation of the sounds
occurring in nature, are very baldly sum-
marised. However, Dr. Pei’s chief
concern is with the development of histori-
cally identifiable written and spoken
languages, and an extremely interesting
hard-headed book he makes of it; dis-
cussing everything from Homer’s Greek
to the difficulty some Australian
aboriginal tribes found in counting
beyond three; taking in China, Russia,
the Zulus and the Maoris (but New
Zealanders don’t use “pakeha” for
“stranger” as Dr. Pei supposes; only, as
the Maoris themselves used it, for “white
man”); and concluding with a discus-
sion of Basic English and the possibilities
of an international language.
THE YOUNG GIRL.
Her round cheek pressed against the pane
In time and silence lost
She sees the leaves and grasses.
The white of summer’s dust,
And winter’s frost.
I take her hand, she listens
For sounds 1 cannot hear
And when I speak her silence
Beckons out of the air
The footfall on the stair.
With hand upon her shoulder
I turn her gaze to me,
Her eyes are dark and empty
She sees not what I see
But what will be.
Though I am strong and sturdy
As though a pane of glass
She looks beyond my body
At what will come to pass
And cries “Alas.”

The BREAKER
of TABOOS
by W.E. HARNEY
Chuck wales was a
human brute, the bullying
kind who take much
delight in torturing people
who are peaceful and unassum-
ing. Bullies are generally
cowards in a pinch, but Chuck
was one who had been trained
to fight when young; and he
had plenty of guts. The
police had made it too hot
for him in the city, and,
having to get out, he was at the
end of his tether when he met
Bill Noakes of Pulpul cattle-
station, who had just received a
letter from the manager of his
station that he was having a
little trouble with the Jackies, as
he called the aboriginal stock-
men, and would like someone to
come up to keep him company
and give him a hand to run the
place.
So Chuck got the job; he
bought himself a swag and some
bush clothes with some pay in
advance and before long he was
on the plane, heading north.
After a day’s flying and a motor
trip over three hundred miles, he
finally pulled up at Pulpul, his
future home.
The manager of the place, Jim
Dare, met him. He had heard
about Chuck and his ability to
handle himself, and although he
was a little relieved to have a
man like him about the place as
a backstop in his bickerings
with the Jackies, he was never-
theless uneasy. For Jim Dare
had learnt from bitter experience
that force may be all right for a
time, but the day will come
when some blackfellow puts you
down, and then . . .
“Glad to meet you,” from
Chuck as he shook Jim’s hand.
“Damn’ glad to be here. It’s a
long way to travel.”
“Glad to see you, too,” from
the other. “You’ll find every-
thing O.K. here. Hey!” The
last exclamation was to a black-
fellow passing by. “Carry this
swag to the house.”
As they went into the main
building a native girl rang the
bell that told them the smoke-oh
was ready in the dining-room.
“What’s the Jackies like?”
Chuck asked as he put his
enamel pannikin down on the
table. “Bill Noakes tells me
they’re a pain in the neck,”
“Not as bad as that,” Jim said,
laughing. “You see, in .a place
like this with a long distance to
the cattle market, and tucker so
hard to get carted out from the
railway, it’s a matter of tighten-
ing up on the belt after Bill
Noakes gets his cut from the
sales. So it’s not too much for
us and damned little for the old
blackfellows who’ve got to do
all the work.”
“What! I thought from what
Noakes said they were well fed,
but just a mob of loafing rogues,
and always having a go at you.”
“The part about the loafing
is all me eye,” Dare said. “But
this tribe here is full of native
law. Taboos. All right in the
past when the old men used it to
get hold of the youth of the
tribe. It’s nearly useless now,
but you just can’t break it up.”
“Just watch my smoke,” said
Chuck Wales as he got to his
feet and went outside to survey
the country around him.
CHUCK’S first brush with
aboriginal custom came
down at the stockyard. He
asked one of the natives work-
ing with him to call put to a
woman who was
passing by. His
request was quite
natural. He
wanted to give
her a message to
take over to the
manager at the
main house. But
when the native
indignantly refused because,
as he tried to explain, the
woman was his mother-in-
law, and as such was taboo to
him, Chuck saw red. In the
brawl with sticks and fists that
followed this perfectly natural
explanation, the whole tribe came
down to the yard in time to see
the upholder of tribal law being
carried away. Amid the dust
was Chuck telling Jim about it.
“Blasted mongrel damn’ well
refused to do what I told him.
Some business about his mother-
in-law. Hell Jim, we don’t
* tand for slli y thm S s
llke that!
“We’re just as stupid with
some of our own customs,” Jim
said. “Damn’ it all. Chuck, you
can’t go about doing these
things. You’ll find yourself
with a spear in your side.”
“They’ll just do what I tell
’em while I’m here,” retorted
Chuck. “How’s a man to know
whether the thing’s all right or
the blasted Jacky’s just putting
something over?”
So peace came once more,
and slowly Chuck learned about
the different prohibitions of the
tribe. How brother must not
talk to his adult sister and, when
he gives her food, must toss it on
the ground as one does to a
dog. He nearly had another row
on his hands when his native
helps refused to eat some food
that Chuck sent up to them by
a woman tabooed by some
“women business,” and he
cursed aloud at all this stupidity
when his native girl-friend
would not eat some food be-
cause, so she said, it was “Sun-
day business,” and if she ate it
she would die.
“Who made it Sunday busi-
ness?” yelled Chuck. “I’ll belt
the hide off him.”
“Old men,” the girl replied.
“Which one?” Chuck asked.
But to this question he re-
ceived no answer.
C VERYWHERE Chuck found
I—' himself up against the pattern
of aboriginal life. He became
obsessed with the need for break-
/own tribal taboos He
wanted to get even with those
mystical “old men,” always
mentioned with awe by the
younger people, but never seen
about the camp.
“Surely to hell,” he remarked
one day to Jim Dare as they sat
down to their evening meal,
“these old useless blackfellows
in the camp can’t be the old
men these strong young Jackies
fear! Why,” he roared, “they
could belt a whole paddockfui
of the animals any day before
breakfast and then sit down to
a good feed afterwards.”
But Jim quietly remarked,
“Belt them with their hands, yes,
but the old fellows have some-
thing stronger than force”
“And what’s that? What’s
greater than force?”
“The fear of the old men and
their magic.”
“Bah! ” Chuck said. “If I
could lay my hands on the devils
I’d belt th« daylights out of
them,”
'"THE day after this argument
1 with Jim, Chuck had to go
with his native helps to get some
timber for the stockyard. As
they harnessed up the horses
Chuck remembered hearing of a
big patch of timber down by the
river—a place called Walduk.
But when he spoke of it to the
natives they were loud in their
persuasions to keep away from
j k jt had been put under a “Big
Sunday taboo” by the old men.
The more th tried to keep
Chuck from Walduk the
eaßer he was to be there
eag , ‘
After much travelling they ca
to the mouth of a gorge of dense
jungle. Beyond this place the
natives refused to go, saying that
the place was “full of devils with
poison spears that make man go
mad.”
“Have you seen them?”
Chuck asked, and laughed aloud
as he shouldered his axe.
Old man just liar. Sunday
business rubbish.” With that
final burst of sarcasm he moved
into green foliage that closed
softly about him.
As he moved along Chuck
sensed the loneliness and eeriness
of the place. Long vines trailed
over the tall trees; beneath his
feet the leaves crackled; and
then, ahead, he saw a gleam of
light that told him it was a
small clearing in the trees, and
moved over towards it.
The place he now stood in was
a small circle with a heap of
stones in the centre covered by
newly-plucked leaves from the
jungle trees around.
“Sunday business.” Chuck
smiled grimly to himself as he
thought of how he would bring
ridicule on the “old men” when
he told the women and lads of
the tribe.
The sound of running water
interrupted his thoughts. Realis-
ing that he was thirsty, he strode
carelessly towards the ravine.
His weight upon the friable edge
brought disaster upon Chuck
Wales. Crash! He cursed as
he tumbled amid the green
foliage beneath. And then the
“devils of the jungle” were upon
him.
For this sacred jungle of
Walduk was —because of its
abundant food and shelter —the
home of a vicious tree-hornet,
and, out of the knowledge from
past ages, the old men of the
tribe had placed it under taboo.
Now the white breaker of the
tribal lore was learning his first
lesson about tribal taboos. •
Frantically Chuck got to his
feet, but already he was partly
blinded by the stinging, insects,
and, cursing, he stumbled into
the dense growth to fall head-
long into the gully below. He
struck the hard rock bottom ; he
felt a great pain as his leg
crumpled beneath his body ; and,
helpless and stunned, he rolled
and writhed in his agony.
His exposed face was a living
mass of hornets as they drove
their stings into his eyes and lips,
so that he was blind, and could
not cry aloud for the help he so
much needed. As he fought
to be away from this place of
dread Chuck Wales first knew
fear, and with that new thought
upon him he heard the timbers
break around, and heard the
cries of the old men as they
lifted and bore him to safety.
WHEN he lay in the sunlight,
Jim Dare putting bark
splints on his leg, the native
women rubbing something on
his stings to drive away the pain,
he heard the story.
“Good job for you,” remarked
Jim as he tightened a piece of
torn shirt on the improvised
splint, “that you told the Jackies
you were going to the Walduk.
The blacks reported it to the old
men. They came and told me
the secret. They use that place
as a cover for their sacred totem
boards. The only way they can
go there is by rubbing them-
selves with the sap .of a tree
that keeps the insects away. So
while they ran to the camp for
their sap I put the horses in the
buggy and away we came. But
we were too late.”
“Not too late, Jim,” Chuck
said. “I’ve learnt my lesson
and thanks, Jim—yes, thanks to
all the old blokes too?”
It was a full day before the
plane came to take Chuck away
to town. He got better, and
came back. And as he got oft
the plane that brought him home
to Pulpul, Chuck shook the hand
of the first old man he saw, and
remarked, “You win, old man.
By God you’re right; this force
racket is only a game for young
players.”
And the old aboriginal smiled,
for although he could not under-
stand what Chuck was saying,
he nevertheless could read his
face, which was that of a very
understanding man.
Portrait of a Pioneer ...
Nancy Keesing
Photographs cannot show truth, they say,
the face
Trapped too aware in its least hesitant
instant
Is emphasised falsely; subtle trait and trace
Important for living reality are missed
By the lens that catches triviality. For
kissed
Lips’ happiness or a laughter-haunted eye
—These are passed by.
Yet her face, hers I write of, ninety-five
She was when “Olsen’s Portrait Photo-
graph
Faithful to Life” was taken, looked so alive
There, on the page—hair white—her deep
eyes snapped
Straight to my own, her handsome energy
trapped.
Eternally outshining her bonnet’s jet.
One could never forget.
“A leetle more to the left, Ma’am, so, don’t
blink!”
And she, impatient, irked with the
occasion:
“Get on with your work, young man, and
do not think
Your art can alter m. .. .” Click—and
now it’s done.
Each wrinkle seamed with old malicious
fun,
Her mouth shut down on the “m” a' trifle
grim.
You feel sorry for him;
There’s more than he knew here. Hewn
from the granite past
They don’t breed like that now—pioneers
like that.
Perhaps they never did breed thus, but
vast
Necessities drew on seething recondite
sources,
And old rivers flooded through new
courses.
Or smouldering embers leaped with altered
desire
To appropriate fire.
Or is it that “Life” and “The Future”
watchfully wait
(As in the ancient tales but with a differ-
ence)
At some extra-ordinary births, selecting
the bait
For their cunning lures and weaving the
intricate snare?
—All those old legends! the neighbors
unaware
And always misunderstanding the glib
and pat,
Promise—it may be like that.
Can eyes alone truly record a history?
—Fragments of her story down any of a
thousand pages—
While from faded sepia challenges the
ultimate mystery,
Eyes young with inquisitive passion and
new desire
And old: for this was a woman who gazed
into fire
Till her eyes fell hack and flared with a
tumbling coal
Burning her soul
That beckoned backwards, distantly back-
wards, beyond
Comfort and custom, grace and placidity.
Into the stagnant cave, to moon in a pond
On a still most wonder-filled night, past
range of speech.
Past all surviving instinct, or furthest
reach
Of intuition to that loneliest plain
On the lost terrain,
Time’s waste devoid of substance, no firm
ground:
Vapors and swamps, neither safety nor
danger.
Nor any familiar sense, for these eyes
sound
As notes of blackness, all lost noises of
wings,
Heart - beats, nocturnal breaths and
sleepers’ rustlings:
Eyes become migrant birds that scream
and rise,
And who now knows the cipher of their
cries?
Observe these faces of the set-apart sur-
vivors
Whom the puny find too proud—sneer:
“Arrogance I”
Ah, carven ravaged features of life’s livers,
Where body and spirit fuse to phoenix
existence
Lucky? Predestined? Far paced from
mere subsistence
You range as far, who are chosen
splendidly,
As ocean from salt-pan sea.
Look at the print again: it’s the land’s
great-granny.
She belongs to the girl at the sunset and
the Redfern Moll,
But no longer possesses herself, owned by
so many:
“Came free with her man in the ’thirties”
. . . “Where iron drew blood,
Scarred her warm wrist till death” . . .
“Was treed by flood” . . .
“The district’s first white child” . . . So
the young relate,
Themselves born late.
Too much can be read in the lines of a
face or a life.
She might have answered—“ Nonsense,
swag of fancy.”
For sagas are not to be prised and probed
with the knife,
Or tabulated and coldly laid apart.
Sagas are for free singing, for the proud
heart;
And lives as hers, adventurous, passionate,
strong
For symbol and song.

ANZUS AND REALITIES.
The communique of the so-called “Pacific
Defence Council” arising out of the U.S.-
Australia-N.Z. Pact, which bears the
curiously inverted name of “Anzus,”
caused more criticism among British
journals than any other set of decisions
which have been taken on this side of
the world foi a long time.
Mr. Casey, Australia’s External Affairs
Minister, said that the discussions took
place without manoeuvring or quibbling
about words, and that there was a
“remarkably frank discussion.” Thus
agreement was reached on “all points,”
and a pretty wide range of points they
seem to have been. The gathering re-
dedicated the three member-countries to
“the task of strengthening and furthering
peaceful relations between Pacific
nations,” and reiterated what has been
said a hundred times before: that the
three countries have leagued themselves
together “solely for the purpose of resist-
ing aggression”—as, for that matter, sup-
posedly, have all the U.N.Q. nations
without going to Honolulu to do it. The
council had “reviewed situations of
mutual concern, including Korean opera-
tions and the problem of assisting the
free nations of Asia to resist Com-
munism” ; but, unless this means that Aus-
tralia and New Zealand have decided to
abandon the British Commonwealth and
act as part of a bloc led by the United
States in all matters affecting Asia, it is
so much empty talk.
For overall security one would
have imagined that a bloc similar
to the Atlantic bloc, with every
country concerned taking part and
pledging practical help, would have
been the only thing worth while. One
would also imagine that a body which is
short of the United Kingdom, Canada,
Japan, France, the Philippines and
Nationalist China has about as much
right to call itself the Pacific Defence
Council as a combination of Canberra,
N. S. Wales and Darwin councillors
would have to refer to itself as the Aus-
tralian Defence Council.
In this case, arrangements might have
been entered into with the greatest
caution and circumspection, especially in
view of the openhandedness with which
Mr. Casey was ready to make available
defence facilities to the United States and
to invite them to Manus (which they
probably don’t want), a trustee area which
does not belong to us.
This is one aspect of the conference.
A more important one has a much wider
significance. It has been emphasised all
along that the discussions are “only pre-
liminary and exploratory,” that the con-
ference “neither reached any decisions
nor undertook commitments regarding
matters of direct concern to our friends
in the Pacific area or elsewhere” ; that the
council “is just beginning to evolve its
own tripartite organisation and pro-
gramme, and decided that it would be
premature to attempt to establish rela-
tionships with other States or regional
organisations.”
But on top of this bit of vague jargon
it announced that it had taken a very
definite decision —to appoint a military
committee to advise the council on
problems of military co-operation. How
this can be done by Australia acting by
itself with the United States and N.Z.
at this stage may not be a mystery to Mr,
Acheson and Mr. Casey and Maoriland’s
Mr. Webb, but it must be to others.
Our naval defence is integral with that
of the United Kingdom, and at present
high commands in the R.N. and R.A.N.
are interchangeable.
Ships, save for the few destroyers and
small craft which we build, come from
British shipyards. Our armament is
British in type. The defence of our trade-
routes to Europe and elsewhere is fused
into one piece, built upon mutual Aus-
tralian-U.K. commitments and duties.
The R.A.A.F. is virtually in the same posi-
tion as the R.A.N., with a British air-
marshal in overall command, and Aus-
tralian squadrons serving in two British
stations, Malaya and Malta, as part of
the defence of our main external air
connections. The Australian Army
is armed with British-type weapons,
which have proved, in spite of much
publicity to the contrary, about the
best in Kbrea, from tanks down-
wards. Our senior officers are trained in
British staff schools. Our C.G.S. attends
the annual British staff conference. Our
arrangements are so much of a piece that
the overall British Commonwealth com-
mand is held in the Japan-Korea area by
an Australian lieutenant-general, the
command of the British Commonwealth
Division in Korea by a British officer, the
brigade commands by a Briton, an Aus-
tralian and a Canadian —he is a Canadian
brigadier, though Australian-born.
How, in such circumstances, with the
British carrying out their guided-missile
and atom-bomb experiments in conjunc-
tion with Australia, and in the Australian
zone, can Australia help to set up a com-
mittee with the United States to advise
it on defence measures in the Pacific
without acting in conjunction with the
other sections of the British Common-
wealth? It is impossible unless grave
misunderstanding is brought about.
In any case, how is it possible for
military plans affecting Australia and
New Zealand to be discussed without
taking into consideration the United
Kingdom, Malaya and India (on our air-
and sea-routes), Britain’s colonies in the
Pacific, Hong Kong, French colonies and
Dominions in Asia and—very vitally—
New Caledonia? If Australia is to
remain an integral part of the British
Commonwealth the strategic problems
of the Pacific must be discussed
and agreed on as the first step by
the British Commonwealth as a whole
and then by the British Commonwealth
countries as a whole, which are sharing
each other’s resources, with any other
countries involved, including the United
States.
Even if the steps which were being
taken were merely casual and exploratory
they would be dangerous. But Mr.
Casey’s version is that a meeting of
“Anzus” military advisers is “urgent” and
needed “practically immediately” because
of the Communist threat. This seems to
presage very definite action. In those
circumstances it is no wonder that the
whole British Press seems to be angry
and bewildered, and that the New York
“Times” interprets what was achieved as
the creation of a “new power-nucleus in
the Pacific.”
The best that any British journal can
say is said by the “Times,” which is
always scrupulous in its defence of
Dominion rights to decide their own
destiny. But it voices the whole of
British public opinion when it declares:
No world Power has a greater concern
than Britain in what happens in the south-
east Asian and Pacific areas. Anything
that touches Australia and New Zealand
touches this country directly. Their de-
fence is our defence; it is an understand-
ing that goes deeper than any words or
pacts.
If proof were needed of this fact it
would have been found in the manner in
which the United Kingdom sent virtually
the whole of its capital fleet to Australian
waters in 1945 as soon as it had finished
a harassing war with Germany and when
its men were tired to the bone and its
whole economy was threatened with
bankruptcy.
Yet there is still more in it than this.
Trade interests alone show the abso-
lute mutuality of the interests of the two
countries in all defence—Pacific as well
as European and Asian.
Post-office Balloon.
Following a Press statement in which it
was “understood” that the Postmaster-
General would report to Cabinet that the
post-office would show a deficit of £3
million this year unless service charges to
the public were raised again—from which
it was to be inferred that the special
appropriation of £1,750,000 provided in
the Budget to meet the latest quarterly
basic-wage rise was in the Minister’s view
merely a bad joke—the Prime Minister
assured the House of Representatives that
the Government did not contemplate in-
creasing postal charges, and Mr. Post-
master Anthony, also questioned, said
there was no proposal to increase them
at this juncture.
No official reassurance of the sort can
disguise the fact that the Commonwealth
department which perhaps above all
others has in its charge the maintenance
of civilisation in this community has
become a victim of the inflationary
machine with no plans for rescue in
sight. The 40-hour week and the auto-
matic quarterly boosting primarily of
wages and secondarily of all other costs
are fast wrecking the post-office services
on the same rocks upon which the States’
transport services have driven. With this
wrecking agency the Government has no
power constitutionally to interfere.
The chickens of the Chifley Govern-
ment’s socialisation experiment, of which
the operative instruments were all power
to the unions and national living-on-tick,
are coming home to roost in the full view
of every citizen.
The public is now not merely being
levied extortionate charges for letter-mail,
telegrams and telephones. In times gone
by there was justification in the presenta-
tion of post-office accounts for the exclu-
sion of capital-works charges from the
expenditure columns, for these were works
financed by loan on behalf of future as
well as of present beneficiaries. But ever
since the later war years cost of these
capital works has been diverted to current
taxation-first, and in part, by applica-
tion of annual profits earned by the
post-office, and now, with the shrinking
of the loan-market, by direct taxation to
finance all Commonwealth Government
current works. Thus the community is
required to pay for the elementary com-
munications run by the post-office not
only the visible letter, telegraph and tele-
phone rates, but also a tax-surchage
amounting to nearly 50 per cent, of the
amount of all three combined. In reality
the public is paying a minimum letter-
postage not of but something like
5d., for a telephone-call not 3d. but 4|d.,
and for telegrams for the shortest distance
a price advancing upon that which its
fathers paid for words cabled across the
world.
Mr. Anthony says the P.O. made a
profit in 1951-52 of £1.5 million. He
says it will make a loss this year of £3
million. Yet these are the figures from his
estimates for the current year, and the
record of the past year:
1951-3 1953-3
(mil’s) (mil’s)
Earnings 59.3 63
Working expenses, less capital
works and services .. .. 64.3 74
Add capital works & services 38.8 28
93.1 —lO3
For long before these post-war years
necessary works like building new post-
offices, modernising central offices,, and
maintenance and replacement of old
equipment with modern were admittedly
left in abeyance, and the costs of these
postponed works are falling heavily in
these years of disgrace on the department,
the Treasury and the taxpayer. The
profits the post-office used to make
annually—in the period 1937 to 1946
alone they aggregated some £46 million —
were raked into consolidated revenue,
never placed into a post-office trust
account for expenditure on works delayed
but foreseen and yearly becoming more
urgent.
But allowing for the consequences of
this un business-like procedure, what “full
employment” under the 40-hour week
(1948) did to the post-office is shown by
these figures of numbers of employees:
9 Years to 3 Years to
1939. 1948. 1951.
Employees .. 43,000 69,000 93,659
and by these round figures (£ million) of
salaries and wages paid as part of working
expenses:
1945-6. 1947-8. 1951-3. 1953-3 (Est.)
13.1 20 43.8 50.8
These amounts, moreover, are pruned in
some fancy accounting fashion from
divisions and totals, clearly set out in a
“summary of expenditure under the
control of the P.M.G.,” as “salaries and
payments in the nature of salary” at
£54,155,651 for 1951-52 (plus special
appropriation for pensions of another
£1,060,278), and in the estimates for the
current year a total similarly made up of
over £61,200,000.
The P.O. does much work for other
departments, not only in paying pensions,
savings-bank operations and other “social-
security” services, but also in field-
engineering. But this does not do away
with the fact that it is today a spending
department running War and Repatria-
tion hard for third-place after Defence
and National Welfare departments as
eaters-up of revenue, and that the head of
it has become a second Taxation Commis-
sioner quite as much as a provider of
essential services to the community.
The record of State transport systems
seems to be repeating here. High costs
are already defeating the aim of raising
more revenue to sustain the services.
Business is falling off in face of
soaring charges. The latest report
(1950-51) shows that in relation to 1949-50
the volume of first-class mail matter for
within the Commonwealth was little better
than stationary, telegrams fell in number
by a million, and the parcels post (also
now in the luxury-class) dropped signi-
ficantly. There were increased deficits in
all three branches. In further analogy to
the trams, the Government cannot even
collect prescribed charges from public
telephones until the coin-reception boxes
are enlarged to take the 50 per cent,
increase in call tolls. Presumably that
process is to go on repeating itself. The
point has, surely, been reached when
higher charges can only drive away busi-
ness, serving no interests whatever save
those of a powerful and aggressive union,
under Communist influence.
The rot became manifest after the
induction into the post-office of the late
Socialist Government’s “golden age.” The
Chifley-Evatt’s P.M.G., Senator Cameron,
hallmarked his regime when he declared
that in his view the trouble in Australia
was not too many strikes, but not enough
of them; and during his time it
was announced in the Press and
never denied that the Postal Workers’
Union got a Communist secretary
who had belonged to it less than
a month. Anybody who has not seen the
department’s workmen laying under-
ground telephone-cables around the
Sydney suburbs has missed a first-class
exhibition of Government stroke; and
the gangs are complete with special motor-
buses which collect each “worker” from
the remotest domicile each day and take
him back home at mid-afternoon, after
waiting all day, with driver, on “the job.”
What the public will expect of
the Postmaster-General in due course
is a frank admission that post-
office charges are already excessive, and
his proposals not for increasing but for
reducing them, in the interests of reduc-
ing the burden of high costs on public
and private users of these services.
Wanted—a He-man.
Children’s Book Week, held in
Sydney, calls attention to the fact that
there is still a golden age in at least one
department of writing in Australia.
Despite radio and s.-p. in the home,
and all the other “conveniences” which
have come with civilisation, the child still
lives in fairyland, a world where
the good never die young—or not
often and there are no income
taxes, economists, gangsters, bookies or
politicians. Virtue is always triumphant
(sometimes after a few vicissitudes), kind-
ness is always fashionable, the brave
always succeed, humor is always reduced
to its simplest terms and furry animals
and storks win the Miss or Mr. Australia
competition every time.
Not all the most popular books, of
course, are Australian, but a remarkable
number are. They all belong to this
century or its threshold, to the era which
began with the boom days of Ethel
Turner’s Seven Little Australians and The
Little Larrikin and achieved substance
with Amy Mack’s bushland stories and
Mary Grant Bruce’s long series, still very
popular sellers. These three authoresses
—and authoresses are the staple of the
children’s book-writing industry in this
country —not only established the business
of writing for juveniles here but intruded
as very solid landmarks into the overseas
market. They have more or less abdi-
cated now to Leslie Rees and Eve
Pownall and others, though their works
still sell steadily if not comparably to
the modern giants of the counters —e.g.,
May Gibbs of the eternal Snugglepot
and Cuddlepie, the gum-blossom babies.
Over 100,000 copies of her books have
been sold, not to mention millions of
other items embodying the well-known
small figures. Dorothy Wall’s Blinky
Bill yarns have achieved fat and luscious
editions. Young Bill Bluegum and the
characters of Norman Lindsay’s Magic
Pudding represent another lusty venture
in the 100,000-circulation class, one which
has a gusto that sets it in a place of its
own away from all the rest and gives it a
universal appeal to all ages and races.
These Australians do not exclude over-
seas products from the Australian market.
But while Enid Blyton, who turns out
books for girls and young children in a
solid stream and sells mounds of them
in the Commonwealth, might be an Aus-
tralian herself in her outlook, and Lucy
Perkins, whose Belgian Twins and French
Twins strike the instructive note which
is considered correct in the starchier
circles of American juvenility, also might
be one of us, there are no Arthur Ran-
somes or Captain Johnses bom here-;
the 50 or so Biggies books of boys’
adventure, one is ashamed to say, are
not Australian, though they are among
the best-sellers of the lot. No pirates,
bushrangers or wild blacks stalk through
our juvenile best-sellers on any worth-
while scale. The Smithies do not fly
again. .
This is one of the strangest things or
all about the Australian children’s book
market. In a country so devoted to
adventure its world of successful writers
for children seems to be given over almost
entirely to fantasy, fairy-tale and the
animal and vegetable world.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Appeal to Panic.
It was no wonder that the “Labor”
Opposition in the Federal Parliament sat
silent and hangdog while Mr. Menzies
(on Dr. Evatt’s censure motion) delivered
one of the most scathing castigations
which an Opposition-leader has ever been
subjected to. Logically, intellectually
and from the point of view of political
morality, Evatt’s speech had come very
near to touching slime-bottom.
The essence of his and the Opposition’s
arguments, when stripped of the jargon
and technicality thrown in to impress
the moronic mind, was that the country
is going over the economic precipice fast.
Nothing can save it from another depres-
sion and untold misery except a
policy of credit-expansion. (“Inflating
our way out of inflation,” as Mr. Menzies
put it.) Bank-credit should be availed of
more, even in throwing around conces-
sions, tax-cuts, increased pensions and
social benefits.
If the sort of thing that came out of
Dr. Evatt’s mouth had come out of the
mouth of Mr. Eddie Ward or Mr. Dan
Curtin it might have been excused. Their
actions are dictated by a sort of blind
animal reflex. They strike as a reptile
strikes whenever they hear the word
“capitalist.” But Dr. Evatt is supposedly
a scholar and a historian. And he knows
how many hundreds of lives have been
lost in threatre panics caused by a few
hysteric screams which have turned a per-
fectly secure situation into a pande-
monium of struggle and death.
Yet he has used device after device
to create lack of confidence in
the Government and lack of confidence
in the country’s economy: to create fear,
distrust and unease and the utterly false
impression that the Menzies Government
is an evil institution which is deliberately
allowing a depression to develop
in the interests of a few big capitalist
monopolies. which are its friends —
capitalist monopolies like the 8.H.P., to
which Dr. Evatt and his Government went
rushing in 1941 for support, guidance and
management of the war effort for which
they afterwards took credit.
If anybody needs a warning at present
it is the “Labor” party. It is playing the
game of the Communists and the enemy
abroad. As usual, the Communist
party was well ahead of it with
the cry of unemployment and depression.
Both parties—Stalin’s and Evatt’s —are
following the same path.
Communism is the more honest. It is
frankly out to produce chaos. But
“Labor,” when its mouths its deadly
phrases—“a hundred-thousand- unem-
ployed,” “imminent depression,” “no
incentives”—does it with a Stiggins-like
seeming of virtue.
The fact is that almost every word it
says is dishonest. If Dr. Evatt were to
achieve office tomorrow and were asked
to apply the expedients which he advo-
cates —further reduction of taxation,
lowering of interest-rates, bigger pen-
sions, unlimited financing of the squan-
dering States (Messrs. Cahill and Cos. to
write their own tickets), Treasury-bill
finance ad lib. and maintenance of the
defence programme —he or some of his
followers would retreat into a hollow log.
The Opposition leaders do not need
Mr. Menzies to tell them that their pro-
gramme and arguments are crazy. They
know it; but, as the Prime Minister said,
the Opposition’s technique for the new
session of Parliament is to create unem-
ployment in this country by “howling
about it and creating a psychology of
depression.”
If it can be managed there is scarcely a
man among the sorry mob which follows
Dr. Evatt who is too proud to ride into
office on the results of that technique.
Russia's Bluff Called.
The latest overture of the Western Powers
to Soviet Russia seems to have met the
usual fate.
The representatives of Britain, the
United States and France suggested to
the U.N.O. Disarmament Committee last
May that the defence forces of the United
States, Russia and China should each be
limited in future to 1,500,000, and those
of Britain and France to 800,000. Russia
rejected this out of hand. It preferred
a scheme under which there should be an
“all-round reduction of present forces
by a third.” Since China boasts that it
has 5,000,000 armed men at call, and
actually has about 700,000 in Korea alone,
and the Russian strength in Western
Europe alone does not fall far short of
1.500.000, with perhaps 3,000,000 to
4.000. in other areas, this proposition
merely amounted to making Russia a
present of the world military situation.
The Western Powers last week insisted
on reduction to specific numbers
1,500,000 and 800,000, as proposed in
May. They added proposals for the
destruction of all accumulated atom-
bombs, the elimination of all weapons of
mass-destruction, the effective inter-
national control of atomic energy to en-
sure prohibition of atomic weapons and
a gradual extension of the scheme to
the whole world.
But Russia is not having any, by all
appearances. Mr. Malik, the representa-
tive of the country which is the home of
“peace,” merely glared at the document
and remarked that he would “study the
new proposals carefully, but that there
seemed to be nothing new in them.”
The next day Stalin proved how eager
he is for peace by sending a special
message to Kim 11-sung, the North Korean
“Premier,” wishing him success in his
battle against the United Nations of
which Russia remains a leading member.
And at the same time the Western Allies
of World War II made another desperate
attempt to induce Russia to agree to
bring to fruition the war-time agreement
to make peace with Austria on the basis
of her freedom, independence and
sovereignty. But Moscow apparently has
no intention of carrying out the absolute
commitments which it signed in Moscow
on November 1, 1943. It intends that
Austria shall become an Iron Curtain
province and the Danube a Russian
river, if it can manage it.
The Silence of Joe Cahill.
Swift changes in the N. S. Wales
political atmosphere have taken place
since the Ashfield by-election result was
hailed as the first rumble of doom for
the Federal Government. With the offer
to the State Premiers of the right to col-
lect their own taxes half the noise and
more than half the threats which assailed
Canberra died away. Mr. Cahill seems
to have contracted political quinsy.
Especially since the exposure of his Black-
town tileworks fiasco.
Ned Kelly policies, such as that under
which his Government seizes property at
1942 valuations with the ruthless inequity,
have received a check He has Mr. Clive
Evatt, with all his associations with
“peace” movements, round his neck, and
his Left-wing has had another victory
in the election of Mr. W. E. Dickson by
the A.L.P. executive to be president of
the Legislative Council —the Council it-
self does not matter as an electoral body
while “Labor” is in power; its business
is done for it behind closed doors by
the outside junta and the results an-
nounced before the majority of members
in the Council eVen know the names of
the nominees.
The liquor inquiry has put new
weapons in the hands of the Parlia-
mentary Opposition, who are already be-
ing egged on to demand a broadening of
the inquiry, and has also raised a cry for a
new royal commission on police admini-
stration, which seems long overdue.
“Labor,” let it be remembered, has had
the running of N. S. Wales for the past
11 years.
Mr. Sheahan, the white hope of the
Ministry, who set out to perform miracles
in transport in Sydney, has merely in-
volved the Government more deeply in
the financial mire. His great scheme for
compelling the people of the Sydney
northern suburbs to travel by bus and
ferry irrespective of their convenience has
been a blank failure. His increased fares
have resulted in tens of thousands of
citizens learning anew to use their legs.
Under his management the ferry services
have gone to pieces in a few months ;
their policy seems to be embodied in two
slogans: “Better late than never,” and
“Make sure of your wharf —hit it.” Last
week it seemed that Mr. Sheahan had
abdicated altogether, since not he but the
head of the tramway union was announc-
ing to the Press his latest proposed revolu-
tions, which involve a proposed reduction
of fares.
Lastly, production is going to pieces in
the State. Jeff Bate, M.H.R., has given
some of the reasons for the decline. He
said that it cost 40s. to transport a ton
of wheat 50 miles in N. S. Wales against
12s. sd. in Victoria, and superphosphate
cost 235. to haul 100 miles in N.S.W.,
against 10s. 4d. in Victoria and 15s. 6d.
in S.A,
And now, with no fewer than 57 aspir-
ants milling round him in the fight for
the perquisites of an M.L.C.—it is
wonderful how his democrats rush the
Upper House —and influenza and other
diseases raging among his members, Mr.
Cahill is getting ready to face Parliament
and an election, the political ghosts of
Messrs. Jim McGirr and J. A. Ferguson
perched on his shoulder, and his majority
scarcely more assured than it was when
he depended on his expelled “majority,”
Mr, Jim Geraghty.
Public-service Salaries.
In an official statement announcing higher
salaries for certain N. S. Wales public
servants, one of the reasons given for
the move was the necessity to compete
with the Commonwealth public service
in retaining senior officers in the service.
To what extent is this principle applied
in fixing the remuneration of civil
servants?
A similar argument was used not so
long ago to support rises for Common-
wealth servants; the extra money was to
dissuade them from leaving Government
employ and taking better-paid jobs out-
side the service. There was, no doubt,
some basis for the policy. In the post-
war boom many private concerns, riding
on the crest of the sellers’ wave, were
holding out fantastic baits even to office-
boys and stamp-lickers. But that spree
is now over, and merchants and manu-
facturers, up against the problem of rising
costs and dwindling profits, are no longer
throwing margins and premiums about
with lavish hand. There is, rather, a
tendency among concerns which have
been paying wages in excess of award
rates to slough the premium payments
by offsetting them against quarterly-
adjustment rises. The fact that this has
been done in sections of the metal-trade
industry without causing industrial unrest
indicates that employees, though natur-
ally not welcoming the decision, at least
recognise the fairness of the argument
that a continuance of the little extra in
the pay-envelope was contingent upon a
continuance of the prosperity that begot
it.
Possibly the authorities responsible for
fixing Government salaries are not aware
of the changed conditions which have
rendered slightly out-of-date the argu-
ment that the States live in continual fear
of having their high-ranking officers
tempted into the Federal service by offers
of higher salaries and that Canberra lives
in mortal dread of losing its best men to
private enterprise. Asa rule the argu-
ment is applied only to what are called
top-rank men ; but how far down in the
service does its influence permeate? Ten
months ago, in reply to a question in the
House, the Prime Minister gave a list of
the names and salaries of Commonwealth
employees doing work “which was previ-
ously performed by the Department of
Information.” There were over 100
persons on the list, and almost every one
of them was being paid approximately
£72 a year above award rates.
Hunter River Problem.
When Maitland was half-drowned in the
floods of 1949 a member of the Dutch
consular staff in Sydney suggested that
Dutch engineers might be able to offer
valuable advice in overcoming a flood
and erosion problem that has been with
residents on the lower Hunter for the
past 50 years, and has come to threaten
the valley with the fate of the Yellow
River in China.
A royal commission issued the first
warnings in 1870. N.S.W. engineers were
seriously engaged on the means to regu-
late seasonal floods in 1899. The river
near Maitland now runs in a bed offering
only half its former accommodation to
the valley’s natural drainage, and at
Maitland the bed is now 12ft. higher and
holding 25 per cent, less water than it
did in 1870. Deterioration has been com-
pounding in alarming fashion in recent
years.
Experts say that the valley is losing
the equivalent of a square mile of topsoil
a foot deep each year. This is not only
a permanent and increasing threat to
agriculture and urban settlement, but is
choking Newcastle port also with silt, a
menace for which the continual dredging
and dumping of the soil on the harbor
foreshores is no satisfactory solution of
the trouble.
The N.S.W. Government’s scheme
(dating 1947) for a series of storage-dams
on the upper river is still mostly on paper.
Three of the eight dams are proposed
to be kept empty most of the time in order
to relieve pressure on the diminished
river-bed during flood emergency.
But the silting-up of the river-bed is
a problem which cannot much longer be
left untouched. Timber destruction on
the dairy-lands along all the N.S.W.
coastal rivers is bringing this retribution
in flood-erosion and the flattening of
river-beds. Where, as at Newcastle, the
steady destruction of the river-bed
menaces a great and vital seaport also,
it is high time to seek expert advice such
as that which Dutch hydraulic engineers
could offer.
What threatens Maitland and Newcastle
today will clog export from our leading
coalfields in due course.
The Peak Downs Farce.
Apologists for the failure of the grand
Socialistic, Queensland-British Food Cor-
poration turnout at Peak Downs (C.Q) —
in its way as big and costly a fiasco as
the African peanut and egg schemes—
have always blamed the weather for the
failure of the sorghum crops, the miser-
able output of cattle and pigs from such
vast “endeavors,” and the rapidly-growing
losses, now well over the half-million
mark.
The weather has now been exonerated,
and by no less a person that H. W.
Herbert, described by “Courier-Mail” as
“former assistant administrative manager
of the corporation.” who told the
Economic Society a few things which
may be summarised thus:
Losses on grain-farming since 1948
approximated £900,000.
Large-scale grain-farming... .with day-
labor, was not satisfactory under Aus-
tralian conditions.
Poor seasons which a private farmer took
in his stride were major disasters for the
corporation because of its high costs.
The board did not have a single member
with practical farming experience.
Instead of farming practice, the general
policy was along the lines of a manufactur-
ing industry or a Government department.
The employees slowed down and worked
an overtime racket.
Labor turnover amounted to a complete
change of the wages-paid staff four times
a year.
Machinery deteriorated and spare-parts
were used at four or five times the normal
rate.
At one stage there was nearly enough
office staff to run every machine on the
place and dispense with the wages-men
altogether.
The corporation began working 1000
acres per tractor but soon got down to 500
acres per tractor.
In the first year a small loss was made
on 11 bushels an acre, but in the second
year a “huge loss” was made on 18 bushels
an acre.
Mr. Herbert seems to think, however,
that “a lesson” has been learned and that
there is “a useful future ahead for the
scheme on a much modified basis.”
The scheme was here opposed when it
was first proposed because the simple
truth is that farms, whether great or small,
cannot be run like Government depart-
ments. Further, Government chaps are
fundamentally unfitted to run productive
enterprises of any sort on an economic
basis.
All Peak Downs has provided in the
way of “lessons” is proof of those two
facts, and the only “future” the Queens-
land people ought to countenance for
it, seeing that they have to find a lot of
the money, is that it be wound up and
sold for what it will bring.
A Gyppo Napoleon?
General Naguib, striking the Napoleonic
attitude in Egypt’s revolution, looks like
rolling over the Wafd, as Bonaparte
rolled over the Jacobins. In Cairo
streets for the “whiff of grapeshot” as
a pipe-opener he substituted a whiff of
tank-exhaust, and the city promptly ate
out of his hand. Serious fighting after
the riots outside Alexandria resulted in
the threat (not yet carried out) of mass
executions of those found guilty after
trial “on the spot.”
Naguib’s proclamation said the Army
had not deposed King Farouk in order
to see the old hands take over, and
warned all political parties that unless
they “purged themselves voluntarily” of
corrupt leaders they would be purged by
force. The appearance of tanks
roaring and Army jeeps full of khaki and
shrieking on their sirens was a
military presence vastly changed from
the scene after the January riots, when
white-clad police held all the street-corners
with bayonets fixed but also with neatly
furnished tables set out for their midday
meal on the pavements, complete with
flowers in vases.
The warning to the political parties
was to cleanse themselves for a general
election in February. The assumption
that this applied to the all-powerful
Wafd party as much as to any other was
quickly confirmed when Naguib ordered
the Premier, Ali Maher, to bring about
immediate and sweeping agrarian reforms,
including:
Limiting individual landholding to 200
acres. The State to take over all surplus
land and pay for it at 1937-39 prices in
30-year instalments.
State-acquired land to be sold to landless
peasants on 30-year terms.
Co-operative societies to be established
in every village.
Crushing tax-levies (up to 80 per cent.)
on high incomes.
Since Naguib has not so far been
regarded as playing the Communists’
hand, he seems to be forestalling them.

owned by 500 pashas, including 200,000
acres by ex-King Farouk. Another
790,000 acres is owned by 2,000,000
fellahin. The other landworkers are land-
less. The late Wafd Government got
into financial as well as political trouble
last year after it had bought up the cotton
crop at such grossly-inflated values that
it could not sell the cotton overseas.
The riots and the xenophobic demon-
strations earlier this year also seriously
penalised Egypt’s economy. When British
residents began packing up, the first local
sentiments of gratification changed
sharply as foreign capital, including Arab
capital, departed also. Beirut attracted
firms bent on saving as much as they
could from the uncertainties of their
Cairo business.
It is pretty clear that General Naguib
is preparing to break the power of the
Wafd, unscrupulous, extremist and fan-
atically anti-British. That should promise
some lively times in the near future. His
attitude towards the still more extreme
Moslem Brotherhood has not yet been
made clear.
POLITICAL POINTS
Evatt’s Budget speech evoked the
thought that if he ever realises his ambi-
tion of becoming leader of an Australian
Government, he’ll be a strong rival of
Moussadek for the title of the Crying
Prime Minister.
Seizing upon a Government member’s
use of the term “Labor-Socialist,” Ward
said in his Budget-debate speech that
he was not ashamed to admit he was a
Socialist. Well, that’s something; many
of his colleagues—including his leader —
try nowadays to avoid the label.
About the most significant fact about
“Labor’s” no-confidence motion on the
Budget was not what was said but who
did not say anything. The leaders of the
attack seemed to be mainly confined to
Dr. Evatt’s “independent Socialist” group
which produces the journal “Voice,” with
the continued aid of Dr. Burton and Mr.
Macmahon Ball. Where was Thomas
Patrick Burke, of Perth, whom Mr.
Chifley was grooming for Treasurer when
he died, where were Calwell and Clarey;
where Joshua, the new financial genius
from Ballarat? Don’t they agree with
Dr. Evatt?
This ’flu is no respecter of persons or
certificates. It hit Mr. Justice Maxwell
last week and sent the liquor commission
into compulsory recess. Just as Toohey’s
Mr. Kain arrived back from London, too.
Chief requisite for membership of the
Victorian McDonald Government is
adaptability. For two years its Min-
isters, in introducing bills, had first to
make sure that they were acceptable to
“Labor.” Now the test of proposed legis-
lation is whether it is approved by the
Libs. First bill under the new scrutineers
will be before the Assembly today ; its
purpose is to guard against abolition of
the Legislative Council —a plan dear to
the hearts of Victorian “Labor,” though
no longer so to their colleagues across
the Murray.
If the bill is passed—and it can hardly
miss—any party wanting to wipe out the
Council will have to get a bill passed by
both Houses and then approved by a
majority of electors at a referendum.
Most deflated figure in the N. S. Wales
Assembly this just-opened session is J, L.
Geraghty. Since the Ashfield by-election
he has ceased to be Cahill’s “majority,”
and can no longer make the Govern-
ment’s flesh creep with dark threats, never
yet carried out, of voting against it. His
spell in the witness-box at the liquor
commission must have been a trifle
deflating, too.
Opposition suggestions that the Govern-
ment is obviously expecting a rise in un-
employment, as it has increased its pro-
vision for unemployment benefits to
£3,136,000 for the coming year, do not
stand much analysis. At the new rates
that sum would provide relief for 24,000
single unemployed or something less than
half that number of family men. In
relation to the whole work-force that is
hardly an unemployment pool; it is
doubtful if it could even be called a
puddle.
First prize for Budget-hypocrisy goes
to the Communist “Tribune” for criticising
the Government for its use of bank-credit.
Isn’t it time something positive was
done about E. J. Ward’s constantly
repeated claim to have a pipeline or
listening-post inside the Department of
Labor and Industry? The general form
of his claim is: “I am kept fully advised
of what goes on in the Ministerial depart-
ment formerly under my control.” His
latest boast on the subject is that his
figure of 100,000 unemployed is “based
on calculations by high-ranking officers
of the department.”
In the week when the Arbitration
Court opened its hearing of the basic-
wage and standard-hours claims the
central council of the Miners’ Federation,
by eight votes to five, directed the union
to hold pit-top meetings in protest against
the employers’ application before the
court, and urged members to “take
appropriate protest action as required
throughout the entire proceedings.” Fol-
lowing pit-top meetings, 49 mines went
on a one-day strike. Week’s loss of coal,
mainly through this cause, was 62,135
tons.
Using his casting vote, Communist
Williams, miners’ council president, got
a motion carried to spend federation
funds to meet the cost of a tour of
eastern Australian coalfields by returned
delegate Gardner to lecture on the Far
Eastern Comintern’s “peace” conference
in Peking.
The Gairs are said to be thinking
about a referendum about legalised s.p,
betting for Queensland. Church leaders
favor the referendum, though not the bet-
ting. Unsavory as illegal s.p. betting may
be. South Australian experience was that
it had nothing on the legalised form,
which didn’t altogether stop the illegal
form, anyway.
The Merino export-ban controversy
looks like becoming a private fight be-
tween the Graziers’ Association and the
Farmers and Settlers’ ditto. The Graziers
want it lifted, the F. & S.A. want it kept
on. Both have political pull with the
present Commonwealth Government.
Some of these little sideline fights have
more venom in ’em than the big stuff.
South Australian road-transport
operators have asked the Playford Gov-
ernment to consider granting three-year
licences to road hauliers. They say a
man can outlay up to £lO,OOO for a big
vehicle and be refused a licence to oper-
ate it before he has half a chance to get
his money back. The Playfords have
agreed to confer on the suggestion.
“Old A.W.U.”: Met Ben, who runs a
mixed wheat- and sheepfarm Coota-
mundra (N.S.W.) way. He’s looking for
a permanent hand at a tenner a week and
keep, plus 7 p.c. of annual net profits.
“Well.” I said, “according to the papers
the Commonwealth Employment Offices
have plenty of unemployed.” Ben
snorted. “Them blokes. I’ve had them.
Y’ got t’ stand over ’em all day. Can’t
do a thing without being shown how,
want special tools for jobs that any sen-
sible bloke would do with a hammer and
a bit o’ wire. Machine stops they stop
till someone comes an’ fixes it. Run a
mile t’ get out o’ shower o’ rain, but
want a jeep to carry ’em two hundred
yards t’ a job. Always talkin’ about re-
portin’ y’t’ somebody or other. Reckon
their forty hours begins when they get out
o’ bed—aw, pigs. A man gets more work
done on his own than chasin’ one o’ them
round the place.” Ben is probably bitter,
but I can’t help thinking of him every
time I read these howls about there being
no jobs.
“Labor” critics who consider £2OO
million an excessive defence vote should
compare it with Canada’s bill. With a
population only 50 p.c. greater than
Australia’s the Dominion is at present in
the middle of a three-year defence
programme costing £2232 million. No
one with any sense of reality could argue
that Canada faces greater risks to her
security than does this country.
There’s to be an inquiry into the liquor
industry in Victoria, too. No royal com-
mission, this one; the State A.L.P. has
appointed a committee of five to look into
the barrel-and-bottle business “with a
view to its nationalisation.” There is
probably no solid basis for the rumor
that George is to manage the production
side of the Victorian State Brewery while
Peter attends to distribution.
From Molongloside:
A profitable investigation for some pundit
at the National University might well be the
effect of environment on M.Ps., and a first-class
guinea-pig for the initial experiment would be
Allan Fraser, M.P., who hails from the cold
Snowy and who is always put up by Labor
after the Prime Minister speaks, to make broad-
cast-listeners shudder. After Menzies’s casti-
gation of Evatt’s effort on the Budget motion
of no-confidence, even a Greenland Lap would
have shivered as he listened to Fraser’s hollow
tones: “Aged and invalid people without suffi-
cient food and clothing unemployed not
registering for their miserable pittances until
all hope and money gone whole economic
system in danger where there was hope there
is fear, where there was faith there is doubt.
~. .Budget provides neither physical nor psycho-
logical incentives a horror Budget under-
developed continent.” And all this has come
about because Mr. Fraser is no longer on the
Government side.
National coal production at 19,087,000
tons for the year ended June 30 was up
2,659,000 tons on the previous year. Most
of the increase seems to come from open-
cuts (2,666,000 tons in N.S.W. alone),
which were just getting into their stride
in the previous year. All the same,
Menzies-Fadden have done what Chifley-
Evatt couldn’t do: got more coal.
Its joy tempered with acerbity, “North
Queensland Register” reports that a ship-
ment of Newcastle and Port Kembla steel
products is expected in Townsville at the
weekend to “help ease the district’s
chronic shortage.” The paper points out
that this is only the second shipment this
year, that North Queensland has suffered
a steel shortage since the end of the war,
and that fencing-wire, galvanised-iron,
steel posts, netting, reinforcing steel and
girders are desperately short. In a way,
this is an answer to those who talk of
“unemployment,” for the men can’t work
without the materials, and somewhere
along the transport line materials are
being held up.
“Labor” is raising an outcry at the
Federal Government’s action in wiping
out air-route charges which have been
the subject of dispute with private airlines
since the Chifley Government imposed
them in 1947 and on which High Court
litigation was pending. The change
means £600,000 to A.N.A., hence
“Labor’s” annoyance. The fact that
T.A.A. benefits by much the same amount
is conveniently overlooked,
Dedman has again been endorsed as
“Labor” candidate for Corio. The
decision should be as good as a tonic to
Hubert Opperman.
Sporting offer. Complaining of the
poor condition of the railway-lines in
his electorate—“rails, bearing the date
1888, were worn out on one side when
put there in 1918, and now they are worn
out on the other side” —Quirke, Inde-
pendent member for Stanley in the S.A.
Assembly, invited the Minister for Rail-
ways and the S.A. Railways Commis-
sioner to go for a trip from Riverton to
Clare to get firsthand experience, adding
that if they did so the people of Clare
would be prepared “to repair the physical
damage, either in hospital or hotel,
according to the disability suffered.” His
offer was not taken up. Judging by the
Minister’s reply that the line* “was, unfor-
tunately, not unique,” he needed no
convincing.
“F.S.”: In a desperate endeavor to
hang on to Melbourne’s antiquated trams
the City Council has voted £20,000 for
the erection of 60 “non-accident” safety
zones. Looking like submarines rising out
of the ooze beneath the city, they have
prows rising to 3ft. on which speeding
cars which try to get at tram-travellers
will mount until their axles rest on them,
or, alternatively, will be brushed off with-
out overturning. Flashing lights and
floodlights will warn oncoming traffic.
Two people were killed and five injured
last month while standing inside the old
paint marks. To call the new device
“non-accident” is a joke in bad taste.
Nobody knows where the diverted cars
will go to. In defence of his trolley-cars
former tram chief Bell used to quote
London as an example. London’s last
tram was escorted to the graveyard a
couple of weeks ago, and now the Hub
depends on buses.
S.A. Opposition-leader O’Halloran
opposes the idea that production is the
cure to inflation. Increased production,
according to him, leads to overproduction
and unemployment. Canada’s experience
in the post-war years doesn’t support him.
A few figures;
1939. 1951.
Steel (million tons) .. 1,551 3,567
Newsprint (million tons) 2,869 5,516
Aluminium (million tons) 83 400
Motor cars .. .. 155,000 414,000
The overall national output increased by
90 per cent., from a working-population
increase of only 30 per cent. Instead of
this increased production throwing men
out of jobs, unemployment fell from over
11 per cent, in 1939 to a negligible figure
last year.
The head-serang of the Australian
Council of Retailers has concluded that
import cuts on softgoods and reduction
of raw materials for locally-made soft-
goods must lead to a “revival of the era
of retail-shortages.” “This,” he sagely
announces, “will be very damaging to the
morale of the country,” and can “only
lead to an acceleration of inflationary
pressure.” Then what’s the idea of all
those “Bargain” notices in the rag-shop
windows?

Urgent Need For Stability
In all the criticism of the
Federal Budget coming from the
Socialist side of the Federal
House there has been no
emphasis whatever on the howl-
ing necessity for greater produc-
tion in Australia, There has been
talk of instability; there has
been talk of “value running out
of the pound”; there has been
talk of slump and unemploy-
ment ; but not one member of
the “Labor” side has touched on
the necessity for each individual
Australian to increase his out-
put during each working week.
So far has the standard of
Socialist economic debate fallen
even from the levels established
by the late J. B, Chifley.
In the round, the truth of
the present somewhat distressing
situation is that the Government
and the central bank feel it is
unsafe to extend credit to pro-
vide for the great public and
private works that require doing
in Australia for the simple
reason that the work cannot be
done by the present working
population doing the present
amount of work per week. No
amount of credit-creation will of
itself do the work required. On
the contrary, we have seen, in
past years of admittedly over-
plentiful money-supply (when
high wool prices were glibly
claimed to be a menace by many
now squealing against tighter
money), a tendency for man-
hour production to continue to
fall to even lower levels.
This fall in the average rate of
national production, if coupled
with an excessive creation of
bank credit —that is, the issue
of new money in excess of sav-
ings—means nothing more cer-
tain than that prices and the cost
of living will continue to rise.
Under tighter credit conditions,
such as have prevailed over the
past year, there has been some
recognition by wage-earners of
the need for greater production
in return for their wages. When
the weekly rate of production
improves a great deal more,
whether by reintroduction of the
44-hour week or by wage-
earners doing a good deal more
work per hour (especially in
basic industries such as coal and
steel), then it will be far safer
to expand credit than it is at the
present time.
Contradictory as it may seem
in prevailing times of industrial
slackness, greater production of
most things at a lower price will
create greater demand. It is
not a surfeit of housing, furnish-
ings, food or anything else that
has brought a drop in retail sales
and a recession in the building
trades; it is simply that produc-
tion costs have gone so high that
buyers have been forced out of
the market. When credit was
being made freely available the
tendency of prices was to make
increasing leaps with every snow-
balling lift in the basic wage;
production at the same time
tended to fall.
Above all things this country
needs stability in its economy,
or as near to stability as a young
country in the middle stages of
its development is likely to get.
The essence of internal economic
stability is a fair day’s work for
a fair day’s pay—that is, the
wage-earner must give full value
for what he earns, and he and
the rest of the community must,
in addition, give even a little
more than that in order to carry
the burden which the Welfare
State has placed on all earners.
Without stability there is
hesitancy in business (as during
recession) and unbridled specu-
lation (as during a boom). There
is much wasted effort —and
often absence of effort—in each
case. Most industrial progress
is made when economic condi-
tions, including costs and the
price-level, are stable enough to
assure all sections of the
economy a reasonable income
provided they work diligently
and render the required national
service. It is necessary also to
have sufficient stability to
guarantee the lender of money
an equitable yield and the
borrower of money a margin
from his employment of it suf-
ficient to make it worth his while.
Australia has a job ahead of
it that can only be done by a
much greater working effort
from the community. We have a
big leeway to make up. There
are no short-cuts out of our
difficulty. And if we are even
to maintain our present standard
of living there must be a great
deal more production from every
section of the people, especially
as so much production will soon
have to be diverted to the main-
tenance of the national assets.
Maoriland’s Budget
Instead of the real relief they
were aching for. New Zealand
taxpayers have had to be con-
tent with only a few crumbs
handed out in Mr. Holland’s
third Budget, which shows the
free-enterprise Government in
rather a pale and faded light,
and Maorilanders have been left
wondering what has become of
the original fine principles and
glowing promises with which
fixe Government turned the
tables on the Socialists. N.Z.
was promised financial stability,
incentives, progress, freedom
from controls and a wide field
for enterprise. So far, although
nearly three yearrs have gone by,
they have experienced the ful-
filment of none of these
promises. On the contrary, they
are so tied up or hedged around
by controls over prices, credit,
exchange, building-construction,
borrowing and whatnot that
they’re beginning to feel they’re
losing ground rather than gain-
ing.
There is precious little in-
centive in the 1952 Budget, and
the brand of stability offered is
hardly distinguishable from
standstill and stagnation so far
as capital-investment, develop-
ment and real progress are con-
cerned. Consumption is still
taking much too large a share
of the national income, at the
expense of nearly all efforts to
plan and build for the future.
Although average taxation is
down by, roughly, £4 per head
from last year’s peak 0f.£102,
it is still so high that it is
swallowing up an unduly large
proportion of total income in
inflated national overhead. This
means starvation of capital
ventures, and lack of the in-
centive, or even the power, to
save, and, in effect, amounts to
bolstering up an artificial
standard of living. In short,
New Zealand is to some extent
living in a fools’ paradise.
After a decade of this form
of living, while development has
been drifting into arrears, there
is nothing Maoriland needs more
now than to redress the balance ;
but Mr. Holland, who seems well
aware of the need in his public
statements, appears unable to
translate his aims into prac-
tice. He has been missing the
mark a good deal in his efforts
to steer a sound financial course
That he is not blind to the
demands of the moment is
apparent in this statement in the
Budget: “Capital for develop-
ment must be obtained in one
way or another from the in-
comes of the people, and as
capital is in short supply all
forms of saving should be en-
couraged.”
Higher interest - rates, he
admits, would be “a greater in-
ducement” to save, but, he says,
“they would add to costs.” So
Mr. Holland is trying to pull
two ways; he wants people to
save more, but they can’t be
allowed any extra reward. Short
of a rise in interest-rates there
is no inducement, and sooner
or later he will have to recog-
nise this. Mere exhortation will
get nowhere.
Lack of capital is crippling
development schemes, plans and
projects while the Government
dilly-dallies, and there can be no
improvement under these con-
ditions. Competing demands for
funds are banking up behind
capital-issues controls which set
a snail’s pace for private enter-
prise and almost throttle activity
by semi-public authorities with
large arrears to make up.
This, apparently, is part of
the excessive price that Maori-
landers have to pay for the
luxury of their costly Welfare
State and for living standards
which rest on the shaky founda-
tions of their 40-hour five-day
week, outsize social-security
benefits which now total £6O
million yearly, and a tangle of
restrictions and controls. It is
easy to see with half an eye that
the strain is too great and that
some adjustment will have to oe
made, but so far the Govern-
ment can’t muster up enough
courage to tackle the problem.
The longer it waits the harder it
will be to restore healthy
economic conditions and to give
proper scope to long-term
demands.
Another Roma “Duster”
“Petro”: The Australian
Associated Oilfields test-well at
Roma has reached bedrock
without obtaining any result of
commercial value and without
addition of any significance to
the knowledge of the geology
of the district.
In fact, the depth of 3879 ft.,
at which the bedrock was struck,
could have been foretold, with
considerable accuracy, from
knowledge already common
property in 1933. Incidentally,
this depth negatives the “struc-
tural high” which" was deduced
by the Bureau of Mineral Re-
sources after several years of
geophysical work which in-
cluded the employment of the
three standard geophysical
methods gravitational, mag-
netic and seismic—and which
were claimed to have given
consistent results with reference
to the test-well location.
In B. 11/6/’52 the writer
assumed that the anomalies
noted could have been due to a
residual hillock on the buried
basement peneplain, but the
drilling results do not admit
even of this explanation, and a
serious error seems to have
occurred in the interpretation of
the geophysical data obtained
as a result of a lengthy survey,
carried out at considerable ex-
pense to the public purse, during
which several of the bureau’s
officers were prevented from
being employed on useful work
for which they were more suited
than for the highly-specialised
search for oil.
It appears that the N. S.
Wales Government has not yet
paid the former owners for the
land on which the State Tile-
works were built, and which, as
explained in B. 23/7/’52, after
three years’ operation, are an
utter failure, though the best
part of £700,000 has been sunk
in them. A representative of
the Ryde Brick and Tile
Works, Ltd., told the Press last
week that it was now more than
four years since the Govern-
ment had resumed 316 acres of
“the best clay land in N.S.W.”
at the “poultry-farm price” of
£7500; but in spite of “the
paltry amount” no settlement
had been made. The project has
been a complete mess-up from
the start, and “employment” in
the works has been regarded as
a joke by the inhabitants of
Blacktown, especially among
’ those who forgather at the
Robin Hood Hotel. The Gov-
ernment’s land - resumption
policy, as evidenced here, speaks
ominously for those unhappy
people now tangled up in its
County of Cumberland “green
belt.”

Australian sharemarkets were
dull again last week. B.H.P. was
only 2s. 6d. above its lowest
level of the year at 425. 6d., and
A.C.I. fully-paids were weak
again at 41s. 6d., with the rights
to the new issue available at
12s. 9d. (making the fully-paid
price 40s. 3d.). Masonite rights
were still available at under 14s.
(345. fully-paid), though the
paid-up shares were around 40s.
1.C.1. rights at 11s. meant a fully-
paid price of 335. 6d,, against
365. 3d. for the existing fully-
paids, A stock which has had
a spectacular rise since it was
mentioned in B. 23/7/’52 at
41s. 6d. is Mauri Bros, and
Thomson (new). Last week it
shot up to 495., then came back
to 475. 6d. in the slackening
market. Bradford Cotton,
though its 10 p.c. div. has been
maintained, weakened to 335. 9d.
again, yielding 6 p.c. R. B.
Davies Industries, available for
a while at under 255., have
strengthened to 28s.

From Herbert Holman
Parliament’s last week before
the long recess was quite in
character with the present
session. Serious debates either
degenerated into uproar or served
as an excuse for ventilating, with
mounting acrimony, the Attlee-
Bevan struggle.
Both Mr. Butler’s stocktaking
of our economic position and
Mr. Churchill’s review of the
defence programme misfired.
The Opposition’s tactics of dis-
crediting the Government at
every opportunity served to rob
Mr. Churchill’s premonitory
warnings of “grave and serious
measures” of their climactic
force. And, in truth, the measures
themselves seemed so much
tamer than their build-up that
the anticlimax was largely self-
induced.
As to the nation’s economic
position, satisfaction generally
is only mild. Our short-term
outlook is reassuring if not very
exciting. Business interests
would welcome a more drastic
approach by less conventional
means. Financial circles do not
altogether share the Chancellor’s
view that the sterling area will
soon be “just about in balance
with the non-sterling world.” A
strong opinion is held that the
sterling area is, in fact, in a
pretty critical state and likely to
remain so while world trade is
endangered by self-constriction.
The same body of critics also
tends to write down the meet-
ing of the Commonwealth Prime
Ministers in November. They
approve the idea, of course, but
would like to know more about
what proposals the British Gov-
ernment intends to put forward.
The prospect of increased
coal-exp6its is good news. (Since
the bank-rate was raised last
April, some 18,000 men, over
one-third at the coal-face, have
transferred from other indus-
tries.) The gain will be double-
edged, for the costly expedient
of importing American coal will
be avoided.
Mr. Churchill’s review of the
defence programme wlas little
more than a series of hints at
temporary adjustments, probably
governed more by Treasury fore-
warnings than by the exigencies
of the world situation. But at
least he suggests a flexibility
which, in view of the present
high cost of armaments and their
early obsolescence, is infinitely
preferable to hard-and-fast ideas.
The other significant pointers
are the export of tanks and ,other
defence goods, particularly to
Canada, and the switching of
engineering products from
defence to civil export.
Rather less reassuring is the
longer-term outlook, mainly be-
cause of the uncertainties arising
from the surge of wage-claims
and the lack of evidence that the
bulk of the nation’s workers
have yet been educated to
realise that their own future
depends upon the simple virtue
of greater effort.
Party Tensions
The Churchill Government is
nine months old and has not yet
suffered near-defeat. Most prob-
ably this is because the Opposi-
tion, not wanting either the ex-
pense or the embarrassment of a
general election, has not
mobilised to the last man at
divisions. The delicate balance
between the strength of the two
parties is still a potent, and un-
fortunate, influence upon the
Queen’s Government: it inhibits
the Conservatives, provokes the
Socialists and disturbs the nation.
Mr. Churchill’s camp has not
been without murmurs of dis-
affection this year. “The Old
Man must go!” was a catch-
phrase that was whispered loudly
some months back. True, it
received much wishful impetus
from the Opposition, whose
reasoning hardly tallied with that
of the more restive Conserva-
tives. Mr. Churchill is 77, rather
deaf and frail in physique, and
not the indefatigable worker he
was 10 years ago. He has to
take things easy. This means
a lack of contact, both public
and social, so that his supporters
see little of him. They tend to feel
out of the picture, particularly
as the Government so far has
not come forward with any new,
vital approach. But Mr.
Churchill has appeased his mal-
contents. In the House of
Commons he is still master,
especially at taking supple-
mentary questions. In fact, the
earlier slogan was quickly super-
seded by another: “A giant
among pygmies.” There is no
struggle for leadership, overt or
covert, within the Conserva-
tive party.
Parliament’s last hours, before
its members went on their Bank
Holiday ways, were marked by
a discordant clash: a waspish
reproof bv Mr. Attlee and a
defiant, embittered answer by
Mr. Bevan. The two have long
been not on speaking terms, and
Mr. Attlee has made it his prac-
tice to leave the Chamber when
Mr. Bevan has risen to speak.
Meanwhile, Bevamsm (which
might be broadly defined as
“crocodile smears” playing
upon emotion, ignorance, pre-
judice and worked-out ideas for
personal political gain) has in-
creased, as may be noticed from
the agendas of the Labor party
and T.U.C. conferences. Mr.
Sevan’s own popularity has not
kept pace with the wave of ill-
feeling which he so sedulously
encourages. He is too clever,
too wayward, too self-willed for
the conservative Laborite. He
is also altogether too set upon
his objective —to be the big boss.
If Mr. Attlee retains any
semblance of intellectual in-
tegrity he cannot openly ally
himself with the irresponsible
and highly dangerous notions
that infect the rank-and-file of
his party workers. Yet if be
repudiates these notions he in-
vites a reactionary label that
might bring his political ruin.
Mr. Attlee and his lieutenants
are plainly determined to expose
and denigrate Mr. Bevan before
the autumn conference gives the
latter his long-awaited oppor-
tunity of leading a crusade
against reaction and, simultane-
ously, of elbowing out his
leader. The delegates will have
to choose between two pros-
pects ; a joyous, runaway gallop
with the respected but mis-
trusted Nye Bevan at the reins;
and a stay-at-home, restless wait
with Father Clem, for the sake
of family solidarity.
Blood-and-thunder History
The English theatre, despite
its lack of good new plays, is
notably virile in the presenta-
tion of lesser-known Shakspeare.
London has enjoyed two out-
standing productions in “The
Winter’s Tale” and “Much Ado
About Nothing,” both from
Stratford, where “Coriolanus” is
included in the current bill. The
Old Vic. closed their season with
“Timon of Athens” and have
lent their stage to the Bristol
company for a refreshing “Two
Gentlemen of Verona.” “Cym-
beline,” mercifully spared the
greater enemy of summer rain,
bravely overcame some chill
winds at the Regent’s Park
Open-air Theatre. And now
Birmingham Rep., in full throat
and Olympian energy, are raising
the Old Vic. roof with a resound-
ing “Henry VI, Part III.”
Their treatment has a home-
spun roughness, quite untainted
by the insubstantial gloss of
West End refinement, and par-
ticularly suits the blood-and-
thunder, thieves’-kitchen atmos-
phere of the Wars of the Roses,
according to Shakspeare and the
several contemporary collabor-
ators whose handwriting is said
to be so clearly impressed upon
the trilogy.
The first section of the play is
pure comic-strip, and one is
tempted to wonder whether
Elizabethan elders cried out in
alarm at its terrible effect upon
juvenile delinquency. It is all
intrigue, rough - and - tumble,
treachery and violence, with
women and children first;
knives flash and pierce, blood
flows and the quite ignoble Duke
of York’s head, mockingly
crowned, falls. Good stuff for
the groundlings and, like “Tam-
burlaine,” plenty of material for
boyish romps.
Perhaps this ring-a-ring-o’-
roses goes on rather too long
for the adult. So much snarling,
posturing and bellowing becomes
tedious after 10 minutes. The
second section (no doubt de-
liberately, like a slow movement)
is in contrasting tempo and key.
There are more unnatural deaths
but quietude, poignancy and
reflection as well —particularly
in the soliloquy of the uneasy,
out-of-place, quondam king.
Again, the last section has
musical form, this time the
rondo. Richard Crookback, with
his recurring lust for power, sets
the motif, and this is touchingly
as well as diabolically embel-
lished by the effect of his multiple
deformity upon his unusual be-
havior pattern.
The Birmingham players
achieve their end only after
several hit-or-miss tries, but they
do get there. This performance
is genuinely creative, an artistic
whole. Never, since the Old
Vic. went West End, has there
been an evening so like the old
times of Lilian Baylis, with so
much energy, virility and full-
blooded makebelieve.

AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS
“Clooter”: Down with the ’flu which
has afflicted Sydney and with Mrs. C.
gone shopping, I had to get out when the
phone rang. The instant I picked up the
instrument two women began shrieking
at each other in pronounced foreign
accents. I could hear nothing else.
Shouted “Hallo” and “Get orf the line,”
but they continued to shriek. Then, in
a pause of their talk, I said “Der vatch
is vorth every penny of toity guineas.
You get it for twenty-five. So vhat for
you complain? Tell me that.” It got
through to one, but not the other. The
first said “That is about a watch, what?”
The other answered “Which is that?”
“Who is it talking of watches?” “Hullo,
that is Mrs. Swtklp?” “Ya, but is about
some watch.” “No watch. I talk to you
some sense, nothing of watch.” “He said
it was tony guineas, but goes for twenty-
five.” “Hullo, hullo, Mrs. Swtklp?” “I
am here, darlink, Toity guineas, he say.”
“Mrs. Swtklp, who is talkink, please?”
“It’s me, darlink. Of the watch it”
“Hullo, hullo. There is nothink wronk.
“What with these frightful price-rises, I hope We haven't done the
Wrong thing”
perhaps?” A rather baffled giggle from
Mrs. Swtklp. A long pause. Then with
infinite scorn one or the other said
“Stinks,” and both hung up. I went
back to bed.

“P.0.M.C.”: I have been given race-
course certainties from all sorts of un-
expected quarters in my time, but the
source of. a tip passed on to me for
Randwick recently beats the lot. It was

and it came in at 20 to 1. The sergeant
was not at all surprised; he’d got the
information from a most reliable source
—the station’s s.-p. merchant!

“Spokeshave”: Adelaide “Church
Guardian” has respectfully suggested
that the Queen should select for
South Australia’s next Governor a
man as distinguished in art or litera-
ture as his predecessors have usually
been in war. Most of the State’s
Governors have been soldiers, two excep-
tions being Sir Thomas Buxton and Lord
Tennyson. Sir Thomas was the grandson
of the man wl*o helped to liberate the
African negro from slavery (and was
also a relative of Rachel Henning); he
didn’t drink, smoke or swear, and was a
great embarrassment at public functions
when he insisted on serving the cause of
freedom by drinking the Royal health in
lemonade or soda-water. Lord Tennyson
was a son of the poet, and served art by
establishing in perpetuity a medal for
English literature to be contested for each
year by South Australian youth at the
university examinations. I won the first
issue, and was presented with it by the
donor’s own hand, but I don’t think it
did me much good except to put it into
my head that I was a predestined poet.
My teachers stuffed me full of facts about
English literature which were duly
extracted from me by the examination
papers, but nobody told me that a good
rememberer is not necessarily a good
poet.

Oregon.

on New Year’s Day,” Very soon the
mess divided into two camps—two of us
from Australia sticking to the Melbourne
beer, the three Englishmen wallowing in
their particular brands, and, after a few
calibration runs, the solitary Scot coming
in on our side. Many heated arguments
took place over the merits of the various
brands, arguments in which Jock took no
part. He just sat there, bottle of Aussie
beer by his side, and quietly enjoyed him-
self. Finally came New Year’s Day
and we were busy with the last bottles.
The C. 0., who had been loud in his praise
of English beer, asked Jock to explain
why he had preferred our brew. Jock
was silent for a while, then he lifted up
his bottle, lovingly and carefully drained
the last few drops into his glass, “Bigger
bottles,” he said.

“Dentonio”: It must be an educated cat
that is responsible for those pavement
scrawls in disparagement of dogs (B.
30/7/’52) —either that or a very ardent
cat-lover. And what’s more, I suspect
the same party of placing, in the vicinity
of Sydney’s harbor bridge, a succession
of chalked slogans in praise of cats: Cats
Are Faithful, runs the first. There

Catchers. Some other hand, though,
must have added the final message; The

“Koorboora”: If “Oliver Filter” (B.
30/7/’52) is to be allowed to resurrect
damn’-fool jokes, here are a couple more.
When the late P, F. Rowland (head-
master, Townsville Grammar School)
was asked at a literary club “Why is a
raven like a writing-desk?” he immedi-
ately replied: “Because there’s a ‘b’ in
both.” Of more recent vintage: “What’s
the difference between a duck?” the
answer being, “One of its legs is both the
same.”
* * * *
“Macann”; Had an old friend of mine,
temporarily living in Melbourne a few
years ago, read in time “Findy’s” statistics
demonstrating conclusively that “sunny”
Sydney is wetter and more often so than
that much-libelled city (B. 13/8/’52), he
would hardly have strayed from ’the
straight and narrow to the extent of hav-
ing a standing bet of a shilling a day with
a Melburnian that it would rain there
sometime between dawn and dusk. When
I encountered him liquidating his ill-
gotten gains he had had the bet going for
just 60 days and was then three quid
ahead of it. But, as “Findy’s” figures
would make virtually certain, no doubt a
fine day has caught up with him since
then.

“Bo”: It has long been an inviolate
rule in pictorial advertising that the
female of the species must never be de-
picted other than widely smiling, and it
has developed into a Tyranny of the
Grin. Whether milady is holding a shin-
ing new frying-pan or a pair of sheets,
all of which she is destined to wash
hundreds of times, holding a cake of soap
that’s guaranteed by panels of doctors to
make her far more beautiful than Helen
of Troy, or gazing at anything from
nylons to pianos, her risible muscles must
always be working overtime. Let them
all be out in the new car, and Mum leads
the family in the widest smile—even
Father smiles, though he is “in the red”
for several hundreds, and he has just
been soaked about £3O-odd for the first
year’s insurance on it to help pay for the
bumps and wrecks of the speed-happies
and the drunks. Smiling, laughing, smirk-
ing, grinning girls look down everywhere
from roadside posters. It has become
maddeningly monotonous. But the limit
has been reached in a trade journal. In
an ad. for an improved dental drill, the
smiling dentist is holding the drill while
his beautiful girl patient is sitting at her
obviously-relaxed ease, gazing up at him
with an even wider smile. No sign of
any of the chair-side clutching, none of
the staring-straight-ahead with a faraway
look, I am trying to persuade the adver-
tising industry to introduce the Scowling
Girl. For a long-suffering public it should
be an enormous relief.
“X.S.”: For years as I passed along
the pseudo-Gothic flank of the E., S. and
A, Bank in Melbourne on Thursday
mornings I have noticed the rows of
sleek black vans, a cross between a hearse,
an ambulance and a Black Maria, drawn
up along the kerb beside the arched lane
at the back of the building with the grill
gateway. I have observed the string of
men busily conveying metal boxes to the
vehicles, other men with hands in pockets
casting vacant looks up and down the
street, never failing to lay a lack-
lustre and noncommittal eye upon
the handbag I carry. Last week
I learnt that the Black Marias
were Mayne Nickless armored cars; that
the boxes contained a couple of million
pounds in bank-notes, which were being
speeded out to factories, shops, Govern-
ment departments and Army and Navy
payrooms; that the men with hands in
pockets were Mayne Nickless men and
that their hands were clutching lethal
weapons. I learnt all this last week
when one of the metal boxes containing
a small matter of £33,593 was missed, the
bank was thrown into a state of chaos
and there was a hue and cry throughout
the country without any trace of the
missing money being discovered. I told
this story to the meek, innocent young
thing who anaesthetises the germs in my
telephone-receiver every Friday morning
and wondered how the bloke who did it
had eluded all those lynx-eyed detectives.
The spirit of Ned Kelly still persists.
“Good luck to him!” said the lass. “I’d
like to do it myself, but I haven’t got
the courage.”
* * * *
“Looby”: Cloves in apple-pies (B.
30/7/’52)? Can anyone explain this one?
As I work my way through a baked-
apple, complete with cloves, I am in-
evitably reminded of a trip to the
dentist’s, because of that clove-flavored
stuff they call a “dressing.” Yet why is
it that, when I’m at the dentist’s and I
taste the dressing being squeezed down,
I am never reminded of baked apples?
* * * *
“Gambit” : At least one mechanic I
know agrees with “Ceg” (B. 23/7/’52)
that his tribe should be rated higher than
doctors. A medico picking up his car
after minor repairs complained that the
bill was higher than he charged for a con-
sultation. The chap in overalls told him:
“Well, I look at it this way, Doc. You
chaps have been studying the same old
model for hundreds of years, but every
year we get a dozen new ones to master. ’
« * * *
“Wackford”: “Smithy’s” clothes (B.
23/7/’52) had their counterpart in the
dress of a student at a Teachers’ College
in N.S.W. At the end of his first week’s
practice-teaching he was told that he was
too negative in front of a class, he would
have to become the central figure if he
wished to succeed as a teacher. The next
Monday he arrived in a bright but hideous
colored shirt, an extra large bow-tie and
sports-clothes that simply yelled. When
the headmaster asked why, the student
informed him that he had taken the
criticism to heart and was determined to
he the central figure in the classroom.
* * * *
“Jasby”: Those citizens who in the
year 1770 met their deaths by “bursten
(B. 6/8/’52) were not the only ones on
record as having made their exit from
this world in that spectacular fashion.
One of the text-books from which 1
picked up snippets of historical informa-
tion 30-odd years ago recorded that after
the battle of Tippermuir, in which Mont-
rose inflicted a crushing defeat on a
newly-levied Parliamentary army in 164£
“ten good citizens of Perth bursted with
running.”
HOW MACDOUGALL STOPPED THE
SCARE.
“The grumbler, the growler or the shirker should
be taken on a swift trip overseas to get his perspective
right; to appreciate the ease and plenitude of life
in this land.” —Sydney columnist Jim Macdougall,
after an aerial jaunt through Honolulu, San Fran-
cisco, the Yukon, New York, London, South America,
including a few hours on the footplate of a train
in the Rockies.
O you who hate Australia,
Who shirk and squeal and swear,
It does no good to jail yer,
You must be sent by air
Where foreign food is frugal;
And, like the scribe, Macdougall,
Come back to blow your bugle
For good Australian fare.
We’ll punish basic-wagers
Who want another quid;
The lower-tax rampagers
Must do as they are bid:
The whinger and the whiner,
Though master or though miner,
Must suffer by air-liner
Like poor Macdougall did.
In horrible Honolulu
They’ll serve for seven days
Sunburnished like the Zulu
And hung, or hanged, with Ids,
Condemned to making passes
At poverty-stricken lasses
Whose only clothes are grasses,
Or so Macdougall says.
In ’Frisco, when they’re landed
Among that strange hotchpotch,
The slang will leave them stranded —
Except that pidgin, Scotch,
Where sport and world-aggressions
And plunging-necked depressions
In television-sessions
Are all there is to watch.
Though sorrowful as Farouk, on
Capri, they’ll move again
Up to the icy Yukon
Whgre men are men till then,
And going through the Rockies
They’ll serve as engine-jockeys
No matter what the shock is
To such fine gentlemen.
On to New York and London,
Flying through shine and hail,
Forced by a flagellant fund on
Macdougall’s weary trail —
The thirsty New York sumba,
And the British mumba-jumba,
And the South American rumba
Should teach those boys to wail!

Jiggling the coin impatiently, the con-

“H.C.8.”: A Sydney picture-house is
screening an old film of one of Darcy’s
fights. No doubt it will help the young
idea to carry on the legend that Les
Darcy was the greatest boxer of all time,
but it left me with thoughts close to
heresy: If he’d lived Darcy would be
about 56 today. He might have won the
world’s title, made a fortune and retired ;
more likely he would have refused to
admit he was slipping until the old beaver
with the scythe had helped some young
bloke to punch the stuffing out of him.
Either way he would be a has-been by
now, in which case no young boxing
enthusiast of today would admit he would
have stood a dog’s chance with the
present-day pugs. But as it is, Darcy is
immortal. Kids who have heard their
fathers or grandfathers talk about the
“Maitland Marvel” never doubt that he
would have murdered any pug of past or
present. I suppose there’s a moral in it
somewhere, but all I can see is the grim
paradox that to be sure of immortality
you have to die before you’ve had time
to do the things that should make you
immortal.

“Kelms”: Parmelia sandbank, just off
the Westrhlian coast, near Kwinana, has
to be dredged before the oil-refinery can
be established there, and to test it the
authorities needed a big pile. Apparently
a suitable one couldn’t be found in W.A.,
so they got one from the east —for £3OO.
Soon after it was placed in position a
storm blew up and the pile went adrift.
After an extensive search it was found,
but a bloke who badly needed firewood
had found it first, on the beach, and had
chopped it up, claiming it was driftwood.
And as it was driftwood nothing could
be done about it.
“Soc.”: “Pawang’s” confessional claim
(B. 13/8/’52) to the E. K. Chambers
Prize for Ineptitude in Shakspeare Read-
ing is up against a weighty rival. No
other than Samuel Butler,, back in the
’nineties, also took Shakspeare’s son-
neteering self-application of figurative
“lameness” to mean that William was
himself lame. Moreover, Samuel knew
how it happened ; it was the result of “a
cruel and most disgusting practical joke.”
Unfortunately, he omitted to say what
the practical joke was, or why it should
be specially distinguished as “most dis-
gusting.” Lord Alfred Douglas, with
commendable and perhaps understand-
able zeal, read Sam’s book “over and
over again” vainly trying to find that
out. “There is,” declared the Douglas,
“not a tittle of evidence to support
Butler’s story, which he never explains
or elucidates.” On the same count he
applies to Sam, whom he likes, the affec-
X-RAY
“Are you waiting. Major—or have you been done ?”
tionate term “flat-footed stupidity,” and
on the specific sonnet (xxxvii) comments:
Line 3. Malone maintains that the “lame-
ness” in this line and in line 9 is metaphori-
cal. I agree with him. Butler insists that
it is to be taken literally in that Shak-
speare’s lameness was the result of the
“disgusting practical joke” which is the bee
in his (Butler’s) bonnet.
While content to let Butler and “Pawang”
contend for the Prize on that score, I
should like to press my own humble
claim on the strength of a reading not
hitherto made, as far as I know: that
the Sonnets were really written by a boat.
For, to borrow “Pawang’s” useful
dialectic, if the words in Sonnet LXXX
“I am a worthless boat” don’t mean that
William Shakspeare was the name of
some useless old tub what do they mean?
“Tom”: “Pawang” may be in error in
a matter other than Shakspeare’s “lame-
ness”—his claim that Richard 111, “when
he walked into a drawing-room, produced
a thrill of horror.” Modern historians
generally reject the legend that Richard
was dwarfish and hideously deformed,
maintaining that his only defect was
having one shoulder slightly higher than
the other. He was certainly not unhand-
some in feature, and was a fine soldier,
which, under the military conditions of
his time, he could scarcely have been if
seriously handicapped physically. His
seizure of the thitme cannot reasonably
be attributed to the psychological effect
of a deformity. Others, thoroughly
normal physically and mentally, have
been led by ambition to similar acts.

“Tom Trout” (London): Am wonder-
ing about the recently reported inclusion
by Dr. Percy Jones, Melbourne’s reverend
harvester of Aussie folksongs, of “The
Wild Colonial Boy” among those “as
proven words and tune of early Aus-
tralian origin.” If that is so, the song
has certainly emigrated. A while back
I heard the 8.8. C. play a record of it at
the request of an elderly expatriate who
wanted it because it reminded her of
home—lreland! Further, it recurs ad lib.
in Hollywood’s latest technicolor Oirish
effusion, “The Quiet Man.” The words,
vociferously bellowed whenever anyone
takes a drink, definitely give the wild boy
an Irish origin, though he does emigrate.
Perhaps the reason for its inclusion is
the pride that the characters feel at the
(American) hero’s grandfather having
been “hanged in an Australian penal
settlement.” Could Dr. Jones be wrong,
or is it another Hollywood dramatic
liberty, like that in “The Treasure of
Sierra Madre,” when a kookaburra was
added to the Mexican wild-life.
“W.M.H.”: Heth’s iceberg (B.
25/6/’52) reminded me of a bloke I used
to work with down in S.A.’s cold south-
east. He used to brag that he hadn’t
missed an early-morning cold shower for
15 years, and, in that time, hadn’t caught
a cold. He didn’t own an overcoat, never
wore a pullover and, even on the coldest
days, he would take off his coat and roll
his sleeves over his massive biceps before
starting work. Most of the men in the
factory treated him as a crank, but the
girls regarded him with teenage awe.
One unusually cold morning he was
skiting to the girls. “The more clothes
you wear,” he explained, “the more likely
you’ll catch cold when you undress.
Look at me —no coat, no vest, no pull-
over,” and, opening a button on his shirt
to reveal his apelike chest, “no singlet.”
As the girls gaped in amazement the
foreman walked up, shuddered and
remarked “No bloody sense, either.”
* * * *
“Pat”; I had always believed the
window-ledges in electric trains were for
the arm-resters of society, but recent
observations have changed this old-
fashioned theory. This morning I hap-
pened to notice the lass across the aisle.
Apart from the small nail-polish brush
she was wielding deftly, she was quite
unencumbered. But the window-ledge at
her elbow supported—comfortably, too —
a bottle of remover, a bottle of polish, a
lighted cigarette, handbag and gloves.
Any girls tossing-up between finishing-
touches and the early-morning train can
safely choose the latter. Adequate
dressing-tables are provided, so long, of
course, as they grab a window-seat.
“Harbel”; While we were standing at
the intersection waiting to cross and
watching the traffic shoot past up came a
woman with a very small vehicle. She
seemed to hesitate for a moment, then,
giving an exemplary right-hand-turn sig-
nal, began a slow' wheel towards the
traffic-dome. The truck-driver behind
her stood on his brakes. His face showed
that he was shaken to the toe- rails, but
gradually a grin spread over his rugged
phiz. A car coming from the other direc-
tion jerked to a halt; its driver looked
just as flabbergasted. The lady com-
pleted her turn and continued on down
the street. What was so queer about it?
Nothing—except that her vehicle was a
pram.
* * * *
“Roadhog”: With the price of petrol
creeping closer and closer to four-bob
a gallon, my thoughts are turning to the
rusty old charcoalburner that lies gather-
ing cobwebs somewhere under the house.
During several war years it pushed my
car all over the State at a fraction of
the present cost of petrol, and although I
cursed it often enough for a filthy, stink-
ing abomination I may yet resurrect it.
* * * *
“Ahreno”; The Russian skipper taking
over the ex-Yankee destroyer demanded
a new gyro-compass, Sand, at that stage
of the war, our R'lsran allies had only
to ask to receive. There wasn’t a new
compass to be had, so I did everything
possible to correct the faults that Russki
said existed, but he was adamant. It
had to be a new one. In desperation I
decided to remove the old compass, pack
it with all the trimmings of a new one,
and take it back to the ship. The dodge
worked, and llusski was happy. Then
along came the new compass the Stores
had said they couldn’t supply. After
all the fuss I’d made trying to get it, I
had to fit it somehow. Despite my assur-
ances that this was a much later type,
a compass far superior to the other new
one, the Russki would have none of it.
I thought it possible my sailor interpreter
had not been as lavish in his praise as
I had been, so I said to him, “Ask him
why?” He jabbered away for several
minutes. A grin came over the Russki’s
face and he replied, in perfect English,
“I know that you are trying to put back
the old one.” Did anyone say the
Russians are suspicious by nature?
* * * *
“Mark O’Polo”: The oft-repeated con-
tention, strongly upheld by visiting
motorists and local pedestrians, that Mel-
bourne car-drivers are the worst in the
Commonwealth, got further support
recently from a far-distant quarter. A
Chicago traffic-institute reports that the
best drivers are morons,”
people with a mental age of 10 to 12.
Once having grasped the technique and
rules of driving, it appears, the moron
tends to stick to them with rigid caution,
thus making a good if unimaginative
driver, whereas the intelligent driver,
being more alert and knowing better than
the rules, is easily distracted and inclined
to experiment, often with disastrous
results. The high general level of intel-
ligence among Melbourne motorists is
amply demonstrated every weekday
throughout the year, but a more flattering
picture of the city’s intellectual stature is
icvealed on holidays, when, with the due
proportion of weekend, female and
youthful Da Vincis of the bitumen added
to the ranks of the regular drivers, the
average I.Q. is jacked-up even higher,
making the night bright and the day
brighter, with numerous flashes of pure,
inspired genius.
* * * *
“The Missus”: Akin to the compen-
satory development of another sense is
the hearing by vibration of the very deaf.
We had a near neighbor who, though a
lip-reader, was deaf to our loudest shout-
ing. When we wanted to tell her some-
thing we rang her up. A similar case was
that of a leading merchant in my home
town. A regular churchgoer, he once
said he considered he was fortunate in
that he missed the sermons, which he
felt would be tedious, but he did enjoy
the organ-music. The church boasted a
particularly fine pipe-organ and he
claimed he “heard” it best through the
soles of his feet.
PHILOLOGICAL DETECTION.
“Quite the latest” were one time accounted
Straw biscuit and ’lastic-side boots,
Their adjunct a stick, silver-mounted —
For that fashion, who cares two hoots?
And likewise the gallant who parted
His hair in the middle had style.
Twas a mode that caught on when it started —
Its mem’ry now raises a smile.
Well, we’ve snap-brims, short sox and “fused”
collars,
We’ve zoot-suits, and Kramer-cuts, too.
“How long will these last?” someone hollers.
I haven’t a clue.
As with haircuts and clothes, so with phrases
For everyday use that we spin;
They become, more or less, current crazes,
And then they begin to wear thin.
Where now are “Oddbodkjns” and “Marry!”?
“By my halidom!” once was thought cute.
They all are as dead as “By Harry!”
Defunct as will shortly be “Beaut.”
Up to date it has met no recession;
Well, give it no more than its due,
There’s a snap in the current expression:
“I haven’t a clue!”
You might at a party have guzzled
A drink rather strange —one’s enough—
And a friend, who admits that he’s puzzled,
Wants to know what you think’s in the stud;
You’ll be asked if you “know one that’s trying”
(It’s assumed some will be on the ice)
In the Welter, the Mixed or the Flying,
Or where you can get any rice;
If a cove wants to know where is Smithy,
Or who was it started the “blue”—
Such queries are met with theoithy
“I haven’t a clue.”
It conjures up Holmes with old Watson,
His bloodhound, his spy-glass and all,
No handkerchief found with some spots on,
No footprint alongside the wall.
“I haven’t the faintest,” it’s granted,
Had quite a fair spin, but at last
It s bitten the dust, been supplanted
(As could have been simply forecast).
It’s got everyone in, that is certain.
Its meaning you can’t misconstrue.
Whence came it? How long till it’s curtains?
I haven’t a clue!

blacksmith’s Epic Flight
PARIS 1679
EWS has just reached us that the Sieur
Besnier, a smith of Sable, has crossed the river
Rhone from a high place on a flying machine of his own
invention. It consists of two poles, with, at each end, a
folding framework covered with taffeta. He held the poles
on his shoulders and attached their rear ends by cords to his
feet. The wings were arranged to fold on the upward stroke.
By alternate strokes of the left and right wings Besnier
maintained his flight. After he had landed Besnier said, “I
had no trouble at all. There was only three eighths cloud at
1,000 metres, and visibility was 20 kilometres. I believe that
flying has come to stay. This is all right for 1679. But
wait till 1952, when men will fly across the world, efficiently
fuelled, of course, by the BP Aviation Service.”

THE HARD CASE
By NANCY KEESING
SISTER McGINNIS rustled
through the white door,
closing it behind her in a
manner which suggested
that none of the waiting patients
need expect even so much as to
glimpse any of the mysteries be-
hind it until their turn came to
be “called in.” She looked, as
she intended, as if making decent
haste to some important medical
crisis. In fact, she was on her
way to afternoon-tea.
The patients, glad of any
diversion, speculated on the
likely time of waiting, where
Sister might have gone—“l heard
a hambulance ten minutes ago —
prob’ly a naccident” —and then,
drawn together by their own dis-
comfort, fear and pain, united
in a bloodthirsty discussion of
accidents they had witnessed,
been victims of, or narrowly
escaped.
Of the dozen or so people
waiting, only the three girls on
the back form remained
anxiously aloof. Elly Hall, the
one in the centre, could have
told them all where Sister Mc-
Ginnis was —with embellish-
ments—had she been feeling up
to form. She was intimately
acquainted with the hospital,
having been born on the floor of
this same casualty-room, due to
her mother’s fecklessness ;. and
having been treated for such
various ailments as malnutrition
and scurvy, scabies, broken arm,
and a host of minor complaints,
during her childhood; and a
succession of “bad” fingers and
“bad” backs since she went to
work at the factory.
Elly was not, however, feeling
up to form. She shifted on the
hard bench and pushed a lock
of damp red hair off her face.
“How y’ doing, Ell?” asked
Mary, the girl on her right.
“I’m crook, real crook.”
“Don’t you reckon we ought
to get Sister to call you in
urgent?”
“Not her. They don’t see you
out of turn.”
“But surely”
“Shut y’r trap!”
Mary looked at Lil across the
sick girl’s back. They were both
wishing they had not come. It
might have been different had
they been friendly with Elly
Hall, but she was merely a
factory acquaintance for whom
they did not care overmuch;
moreover, they would have liked
to know for sure what was the
matter with her. Elly had not
arrived at work until lunch-time,
and had no sooner reached her
machine than she had collapsed.
“The foreman should have
rung the ambulance,” Lil re-
marked to Mary. Elly looked
dreadful, they agreed. She held
her head in her hands and was
moaning slightly.
SISTER McGINNIS returned
from tea. Mary half-stood
up.
“Mrs. Kalapopoulos,” Sister
called, referring to a pink card
she held in her hand. She smiled
kindly at the Greek woman,
Mary felt that she had been
observed and rebuked by Sister’s
disregard. She sat down again.
The Greek woman was gesticu-
lating and pointing to her throat.
“Yes, yes. Inside, inside,”
Sister said and shepherded her
through the door.
“She doesn’t speak English,”
she told the casualty-surgeon.
“Gripes,” he said. “This isn’t
my lucky day.”
“Ah, but there’s a real treat
waiting.”
“Indeed? You know, Mc-
Ginnis, your voice lacks the
sweet ring of sincerity. What’s
my treat?”
“One of the Banks-lane
Halls.”
“Oh, God. Listen, Sister, fix
it up with a plaster and tell it
to swallow sulphur.”
“My guess is—Nurse, get Mrs.
Kalapopoulos on the table—only
a hunch, mind. Doctor—l think
this Hall is parturient.”
He laughed. McGinnis’s en-
joyment of the word was an old
joke in Casualty. It sounded
fine and resonant with the slight
roll she gave her “r’s.”
“Which one?”
“Elly.”
“Now which is Elly?”
“Elly is the Hall.”
“The matron-biter?”
“The same.”
Nurse came round the screen
“Your patient is ready, Doctor
What about Matron, Sister?”
“Nurse Marlowe, you can’t
both prepare a patient and eaves-
drop efficiently at one and the
same time!”
“No, Sister.”
“Haven’t you ever overheard
the biting affair?”
“I’m afraid not.”
“Then you’re a rotten eaves-
dropper, Nurse. Matron caught
Elly redhanded stealing cotton
swabs. Elly must have been
about eight years old, and we
knew the Hall kids ; they were
always hanging about with
impetigo and suchlike, stealing
anything they could lay hands
on, but we couldn’t prove it.
Matron got hold of Elly and was
about to lock her in the linen-
cupboard when Elly turned and
bit her”— —
“Where?” .
“Where would you bite
Matron, Nurse? In you get to
Doctor! ”
THE nurse went off giggling.
Sister McGinnis turned to
the stack, of cards on her desk.
She went over to the steriliser
and turned off the steam.
Nurse was still giggling and
the casualty-surgeon’s voice
laughed, “She’s a hard-case!”
Sister McGinnis smiled. Per-
haps she was. After all these
years, occasionally, when feeling
unusually introspective, she
sometimes felt a bitter amuse-
ment as she buttoned herself into
the uncomfortable starched uni-
form —as if she had a character
part in a play with an all-time
record run: Scene, the casualty-
room in the outpatients’ de-
partment of one of the smaller
city hospitals. Part of the ham
played by Hester McGinnis.
She knew all the hospital
gossip and the majority of its
patients, having worked there,
except for five years of marriage,
since her training twenty-seven
years before. When her hus-
band died, she returned to this
position, and here she would re-
main until her two daughters
finished their expensive univer-
sity careers.
Fifteen years in “Casualty,"
and five years of marriage to a
busy doctor, had had the effect
of storms on rock, leaving her
personality stripped to its essen-
tial realism. She did not lack
pity, but pity took its just place
in her range of emotions. She
often said that either religion or
humor . was necessary to any-
one who intended to make a life-
job of nursing, “and I have no
religion.” Nurses in training
liked working with her, medical
students feared her, competent
doctors found her a “good sort” ;
most patients loved her.
She opened the door to a
knock and recognised Mary as
one of Elly Hall’s “little friends.”
“Excuse me, Sister. It’s Miss
Hall. She's real bad and 1
wondered”
“Patients are seen in turn, my
girl.”
“She’s feeling sick.”
“She knows quite well where
to go in that event.”
“She can’t stand up.”
Sister McGinnis stepped into
the waiting-room. Lil was sit-
ting very straight and afraid be-
side Elly, not touching her.
Mary said, “We don’t even

know what’s wrong —they sent
us with her from work.”
“Very well; very well. Don’t
cry.”
“Doctor,” she called back into
the casualty-room, “can Nurse
come here a moment, please?”
“You two lasses had better
wait,” she said to Mary and Lil
as she and Nurse lifted Elly
through the door,
Mr s. kalapopoulos
emerged, straightening her
hair. The waiting patients re-
garded her with interest.
“What’s the matter?” one
woman asked. “They sent you
out in a hurry.”
Mrs. Kalapopoulos smiled in
a deprecatory bewildered way,
and raised her hands. The nurse
slipped out, shutting the door
swiftly behind her.
“Here’s your prescription,”
she said. “Can someone show
this lady the dispensary?”
A fussy inquisitive-looking
woman volunteered and the
nurse withdrew.
“What’s the matter with your
friend, love?” They turned to
Mary and Lil,
“We only came with her from
work,” Mary told them. “We
don’t really know her.”
“Was she taken sick sud-
denly?”
“Yes.”
The women sat back expect-
antly. Three men who were
waiting got up from various
parts of the room. Almost as if
by common instinct they fled
from some taboo, and strolled to
an outside porch, where they lit
cigarettes and conversed quietly.
The woman who had accom-
panied Mrs. Kalapopoulos re-
turned. Everyone looked up.
“Bloody ignorant Dago!” she
said, and resumed her place.
Disappointment prevailed. Lil
sobbed and wondered what her
Mum would say. Mary com-
forted her softly. Meeting the
bright eyes of the curious female
she said, “Pack of tabbies!” in
a slightly louder voice that
carried.
Two wardsmen in white coats
hastened down the half, behind
the Admissions Registrar, The
Registrar finished buttoning his
white coat as he walked, and
fidgeted a moment with his
stethoscope as a wardsman
opened the door for him; they
hastened through, snapping it
shut with frustrating haste.
“I distinctly heard a groan,”
the inquisitive woman announced
to no one in particular.
“The per-lice,” someone ex-
claimed dramatically, doting on
the syllables. The sergeant re-
moved his cap and knocked.
“Good day to you, Sister Mc-
Ginnis. As it is who it is, I
thought I’d come myself. A bad
lot.”
The casualty-surgeon stood
behind Sister. “Will you come
over to the Admission Office,
Sergeant? We’re just getting her
up to a ward.”
They went off, and then the
wardsmen came through wheel-
ing a trolly. Elly had her hands
over her face. Nurse accom-
panied them.
Mary went across. “I have
her bag here,”
“Thank you,” said the nurse.
“I’ll take it along.”
A YOUNG sister, just finished
her training, entered the
casualty-room with great
dignity, leaving the door open so
that everyone could see her sort-
ing the cards on the table. She
flipped them over resentfully
and efficiently. Damn the Halls
and their slapdash ways, causing
this fuss just as she was going
off duty! However, the reflec-
tion that the overtime would
finish off the lay-by on a maroon
twin-set half-smoothed a line of
bad temper from her mouth. No
doubt about McGinnis, old
slavedriver; remembering who
was on and who was off like a
bloody time-sheet.
“Mr. Ferris,” she called, in a
dispassionate, businesslike voice,
“There’re three men outside-
I’ll get him for you, Sister”
offered the inquisitive woman.
“Not here. Missed his turn.
Mrs. Mulligan!” called the young
sister. An elderly woman rose,
flustered, and the officious one
trotted out to warn the men that
the machine was again turning
over. They re-entered the room
in a group, all four of them
eyeing Lil and Mary.
“Still waiting for your friend?”
asked the woman nastily.
“Sister asked us to stay,” Mary
told her.
“Ah! The perlice ’ll be
having a word with you!” said
the woman. Lil sniffed into her
handkerchief.
Sister McGinnis came back.
She looked tired standing at the
entrance, glancing round. Then
she walked briskly over to the
girls.
& “You’d better keep your place
or you’ll miss your turn, Mrs.
Panton,” she said to the woman,
“Yes, Sister. What’s the
matter, Sister?”
“Matter?” Coldly.
“With the red-headed girl.”
“Diagnosis is for doctors, Mrs,
Panton. I have a cup of tea for
you girls. Will you come with
me?” They followed her down
the main hall to a small room
at the rear of the Admission
Office. The police sergeant stood
up and passed them a plate of
biscuits while Sister poured tea.
He took their names and
addresses.
“Well, of all the luck!” Me-
Ginnis exclaimed. “They live
bang on the way to the station,
both of them. You can drive
them home.” She turned to Lil.
“Would your mother be Mrs.
Gladys Hansen?”
“Yes, that’s Mum.”
“Then you tell her if she’s
worried about this to call in and
see me tomorrow morning. I'll
have a word with her.”
“Gee—thanks.”
“Thanks for the tea,” Mary
said, as they went off to the
police-car.
K A ATRON had been in town
IVI all day, and did not return
until after dinner. Normally
she only did ward-rounds in the
morning, but, having read the
day-sheet on her desk, she sighed
and changed into uniform,
Then, billowing, she descended
on the ward where Elly Hall lay,
and, after speaking to the sister-
in-charge, sailed across to the
bed, screened so as to be hidden
from the ward, but clearly
visible from Sister’s desk. Elly
lay sleeping quietly. Matron
thoughtfully regarded the loiter-
ing, sticky flow of blood dripping
evenly down its clear plastic
tubing into the girl s left arm.
She turned to the sister, stand-
mg attentively at her side.
“McGinnis is in, I suppose.
“I think so, Matron.”
“No Wood-transfusionswhen
we dealt with Elly s mother,
Funny thing, it was this ward
and I was in charge. McGinnis
was senior nurse in Cas. then, if
I remember.
Matron swept downstairs, her
big, tightly-corseted breasts
heaving slightly, perhaps because
of exertion, memories of Ellys
mother, or reminiscence of the
famous bite.
Sister McGinnis half-rose
from a deep armchair when
Matron entered the sisters
drawing-room.
“Don’t get up.” Matron’s
glance fell, on McGinnis s kicked-
off shoes.
“You look tired.
“Hmm.” At least she looked
quite different out of uniform,
Her springy black hair could
not be said to soften her face,
but it did not, like the veil, force
into relief all the small, sardonic
lines that emphasised, when she
wore uniform, her slightly-
battered appearance.

“Shamuseen”; Old Joe, the Wire-
grass station blacksmith, was hauled from
his bunk on the Sunday afternoon of
the visit by the tennis-party from the
railhead at Mulgaville, and amid great
mystery was drafted up to the homestead
by the missus. Half an hour later he re-
turned to the men’s huts, redolent of rum
but adamantly reticent about the object
of his errand. Not till his tongue was
loosened six weeks later by the rum at
the jamboree put on by the shearers after
the cut-out of the shed did he explain;
“Although a big mob of sheilas had
come out with the tennis-party the only
sign of a female, except for the missus,
I could see at the homestead was that
part not covered by two blankets and
which a crochet-needle was slickin’ into.
The missus told me to have a good go
at the rum-bottle and then get to work
extractin’ the needle. I pretty quick
snapped the needle off at the shank and
pushed the barb through. But I still
don’t know which one of the town
sheilas I operated on, because they were
all cunning enough to put on a bit of
a limp, though only one of ’em had
sat on the crochet-needle she’d been
carrying when the utility bumped over a
culvert on the way out.”

“Phoongyee” (South Africa); So
“8.A.K.” (B. 18/6/’52) thinks the call of
the dove is like that of the cuckoo. Here’s
another sound of the dove’s note. Majuba
Hill, famous in Boer War annals, is
really Amajuba in the Zulu language, and
means the hill of the doves. Let “8.A.K.”
repeat, softly, slowly and drawlingly,
amajuba, amajuba, amajuba, and thus
satisfy himself that this name is certainly
the coo of the dove. Incidentally, there
are thousands of these little grey coves
always fluttering round this twin-horned
hill.

“Brick E.”: I’ve been working “mates”
with a very new New Australian. His
command of English is about equivalent
to my knowledge of Italian© —which
gives us about 40 words between us. The
fact that many English words derive
from the mother of his tongue helps our
conversation a little, but there are pit-
falls. For instance, his “Oona, duo, tree,
quatro,” etc. (spelling phonetic), have not
digressed so very far from the Latin, and
are easily understood as “one, two” and
so forth; on the other hand, when he
gabbled something about a “moratora” I
naturally concluded it had some bearing
on the Act concerning mortgages. It
didn’t; a moratora is an Italian brick-
layer. Still, a “carnie” is a dog; “terra,”
earth ; “peerd-o,” feet; “auto-mobilee,”
car ; but a “guava”—well, when Mario
wanted to buy one I shook my head ; I
hadn’t seen the tropical fruit since my
barefooted days. However, he marched
confidently into a grocer’s shop and
emerged triumphant! A guava, in
Italian, is an egg. Yesterday he was sent
out to do a job on his own. During the
morning he rang the office. Called to
interpret, I caught the words “aqua,”
“freddo,” “scalpie,” “time-a-keeper” and
pieced the rest up: “ ‘Aqua’ is water,
‘freddo’ means cold, ‘scalpie’ would be
head ; of course he must be frightened
that the rain will give him a cold in the
head and he wants the timekeeper to take
his old beret to him. I’ll get it.” On his
return from doing the rounds the time-
“Do you know anything about cars?”
keeper came straight across to me.
“You’re a hell of an interpreter,” he
grinned. “ ‘Scalpie’ means boots. He
wants the gumboots.”

“Dune”: Perfected by a Canadian,
colored eggs are now to the stage of
being a minor commercial proposition.
By crossing an Araucana (Chilean poultry
which lay blue eggs) with a Barnavelder
(Holland, laying a chocolate-brown egg)
and the progeny of this cross with an
Orloff (Russian, laying yellow eggs), the
final result has been called the Onta Cana.
Onta Cana produces eggs of a color-
range from olive-green to khaki. Queer
thing about this breed is that they are
non-setters; all eggs for hatching are
either incubated or placed under hens of
ordinary breeds. Still, our own poultry-
farmers aren’t so far behind when it
comes to the glamorously-colored goog—
their chooks have been obliging with
golden ones ever since Inflation began.
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: Four blokes who
were reported missing to the Kalgoorlie
(W.A.) police recently had merely struck
a spot of car trouble while on a duck-
shooting trip to Rowles Lagoon, out from
Ora Banda. That’s not quite desert
country, but it’s not far short of it either,
and unless you knew you wouldn’t expect
to find either ducks or water out there.
But at times there are both in large
quantities. Rowles Lagoon is a fresh-
water lake, with plenty of tea-tree in
it, and it’s one of the very few inland
lakes that doesn’t dry up quickly after
the rains cease. It’s the main watering-
place for the Black Flag station, and
when I was there 20-odd years ago a cove
who claimed to know told me that years
before, when it went dry in a drought, a
windmill was erected at a spring near its
centre. He reckoned it was still there
and could be seen, at times, when the
levels went down. If that’s so the lake is
deeper than most of them. Two features
of that desert country which mystify
strangers are the torrential downpours
that occur and the presence of a body of
fresh water in a chain of salt-lakes.

“324”: All her life one Victorian
country woman has been puzzled as to
why she was nicknamed Metheress or
Metheras. Her parents thought that her
grandfather, a highland Scot and a sheep-
man, might have started it, and the rest of
the family kept it going; but nobody
knew its origin. Now “Loulalo” (B.
25/6/’52) would seem to provide a key
in the set of words once used in counting
sheep in Cumberland (Eng.), and
maybe elsewhere ; for Australia had early
shepherds from all parts who doubtless
retained their own idioms while living. In
the set given, methera means four: the
lady was the fourth child, or “lamb,” bom
to her parents on a sheep-station 50 years
ago, and that is the probable origin of a
very musical name.
* * *
“Herbert Dawson”; Another cross-
word-puzzle blue (B, 30/7/’52) —not The
Bulletin’s gave “ambler” as the
answer to an equine “slow walker.” An
ambler, of course, is to the bushman
really a “pacer”—that is, a horse using
both legs on the one side at the same
time, whereas the straight walker uses
off-fore with near-hind, and so on. No
straight walker can get near an ambler.
I have at present a young horse of my
own breeding that is an average walker
with an occasional tendency to break into
a shuffling attempt at an amble, which I
am encouraging. His mother was a fast
walker and, particularly when headed for
home, would change now and then to a
swinging amble that added another mile
to the sixty minutes. Incidentally, there
was the quizmaster who asked the lady
contestant what gender was denoted by
“gelding.” Either because of ignorance
or embarrassment on her part she failed
to answer in the required time. “Oh,
hard luck. But you really should have
known that. Male, of course. Most
definitely male,” he exclaimed.
* * * *
“Benbow”: “Lower Tops’!” (B.
23/7/’52) says that Bully Hayes com-
manded the white brigantine Leander. It
was actually the black-painted brig
Leonora, built by Duthie at Aberdeen
in 1860, of 218 tons gross, mounting four
guns, also known as the Pioneer and
Waterlily. The old Bulletin writer Louis
Becke was supercargo of this vessel when
she was lost at San Kusaie ; W. Hayes
was master of it at the time. Other rigs

as dead as the brig are the snow
(rhymes with how) and the lugger ; the
Torres Straits pearling luggers are really

“Curate’s Egg”: The joke played with
blank cartridges on Little Curl (B.
16/7/’s2} recalls another I witnessed ip
a little s.-w.-Q. town. From the veranda
of the one-story pub where we were
seated we could see across the road in
front of the opposition hostelry a sleeping
drunk so seated on an empty beer-barrel
that the letter “O” on the label of the
cask was visible between his suspended
legs. Suddenly
the drunk was
spilled on the
ground as we
heard the crack
of a .303 from
a room on our
right. The
drunk picked
himself up,
inspected th e
shattered stave
of his late seat
with the letter
“O” pierced
dead - centre,
stood the
barrel up again
and resumed his snooze. I was among
several who, dwelling on the possibility
of the joke having misfired, did not join
in the general mirth with which the effort
was hailed. Clearly resenting our atti-
tude, the perpetrator of the prank forth-
rightly explained: “Bill’s my mate and
we’ve been kangaroo-shooting together
for years, but we always dissolve partner-
ship when we come to town for a bender
and we stay at different pubs. He knows
I’d never miss, just the same as I know
he’d never miss if he tried the same trick
on me. It’s the way one of us lets the
other know he reckons it’s about time
we got out after the ’roos again.”
* * * ♦
“Old-timer”: Sunday afternoon. On
the hut veranda a lazy four-handed crib
game droning on. Flat on his back with
his head pillowed on the doorstep Big
Fleming slept, his mouth open. Little
Curl glanced at him, started, and prodded
Pocketknife. A large wood-spider,
commonly called a “triantelope,” rested
on Fleming’s cheek. Pocketknife made
a convulsive leap and shot out a hand
to brush it away. The spider popped
into the nearest refuge—Fleming’s open
mouth. Before anything could be done
the mouth closed, Fleming swallowed un-
consciously, grunted, turned on his side
and slept. The crib-players looked at
each other, Little Curl slightly green.
Pocketknife shook Fleming awake and
said, “Hey, better get some soda or
tobacco or somethin’ inter y’, Bob. Y’
just swallowed a triantelope.” Big
Fleming sat up lazily and grinned. “Have
a go at the other leg,” he mocked. “This
one has been pulled.” In all seriousness
they assured him of the fact. “Garn,”
Fleming said. “I know you blokes too
well. Triantelope! Why didn’t y’ make
it a black-snake or somethin’?” They did
their best, but Fleming sneered at them.
About a month later Fleming and Pocket-
knife were dummying a post and a herd
of triantelopes ran out of the old post.
Fleming laughed. “Reminds me of the
time you blokes tried t’ kid I’d swallered
one o’ them,” he said. “Kid y’, y’ silly
goat,” said P. “It was fair dinkum.”
Fleming looked at him, then hurriedly
turned away, vomited and was so sick
P. had to put him in the spring-cart and
take him home.

“Kesem”: It seems to require a heat-
wave accompanied by a drought, followed
by autumn and winter rain such as we
have had in South Queensland this season,
to germinate Geraldton wax-plant seeds,
In this area, where the popular Westralian
shrub does so well in the sandy soil, many
of my neighbors are boasting of a
splendid seeding. In one case seedlings
are coming up though the parent tree has
been dead over two years.
FLIES ON MY BACK.
In days gone by when I would make
The trip to Bun go Flat
And Dad’s provisions to him take
It always happened that
Our flies sat up and looked at me
As I tied up my pack,.
And all got ready instantly
To ride upon my back.
They jumped up off the cowdung-heap
And gave their wings a brush,
Our dog’s flies that were sound asleep
Woke up and joined the rush,
And some gave all their boots a rub
And some pulled up their sox
And absent ones came from the scrub
In mobs and herds and flocks.
The kitchen flies then washed their hands
And from our rubbish-hole
Came different sorts of eager bands
Who lost their self-control
And pushed and shoved and trampled on
The ones who chanced to slip
In fear th“Ll, perhaps, had gone,
They’d miss the picnic trip.
Then when we’d set off for the Flat
(The food, the flies and I)
Dark swarms of them flew round my hai
And swarms around each eye
While in the rear the back-seat mob
t A keen attack began
To get into my pack and rob
My poor Dad of his scran.
And when I’d get to Dad’s old mine
They’d leave me for the while,
Then sit down on Dad’s bench to dine
In country-picnic style
And swarm the cake and flood the meat,
Attack each jar and tin,
Then buzz about and wipe their feet
On us ere we’d begin.
Once as we left (my flies and I),
My Dad had this to say:
“Run, jump and skip; give them the slip
And lose them on your way.”
To which I said, “The more you jump
The more the brutes attack;
They rode me here and much I fear
That they will ride me back.”

“Mat’s Mate”: Just after the last
quarter of the Undowangie-Walpebool
match started heavy showers began beat-

the ruck on the Undo, wing half-back
line, and with nothing much to do because
the play was all up the other end,
borrowed a gamp from an onlooker and
he and the Walpe. half-forward stood
under it, ignoring the inevitable barrack-
ing from the crowd. Then the play
changed, a long kick sent the ball towards
Mat’s wing. “Here, hold this!” he said,
shoved the brolly in the other’s hand and
shot away to meet the ball. By the time
the Walpe. man had recovered and
dropped the brolly Mat had cleared. Then
he abused the Walpe. man for dropping
the brolly in the mud.

“D.J.M.”: It was race-week at Woop-
naturra. Interest in the Gidgee Stakes
was keen, the town’s s.-p. man doing a
roaring trade. Not to be outdone, Jimmy
Packet, the local aboriginal poker champ.,
was also running a book for his black
cobbers, who seemed anxious to lay their
two-bobs with Honest Jim. The big race
was a close tussle, an outsider called
Taxi winning the event by a short head.
Curious about Jimmy’s bookkeeping
methods, a couple of stockboys strolled
over to watch the payout. A tall, skinny
buck was, apparently. Taxi’s only backer.
After a bit of excited jabbering, Jimmy
presented him with two-bob and the buck
walked off with his mates, looking highly
pleased with himself. One of the stock-
boys asked, “Jimmy, how much that feller
bet on Taxi?” “Two-bob,” said Jimmy,
“But you only give him his two-bob
back. He must have won something on
an outsider like Taxi.” Jimmy looked
nonplussed at this for a moment. Then
he gave his most engaging grin, and said,
“Yair, that feller Taxi lose, me keep two-
bob. Taxi win, me give ’urn back two-
bob, and everythin’ orri’!” The stock-
boys wandered back to then* own bookie,
pondering the pitfalls of gambling with
Stone Age confidence-men.

“Puzzled”: In W. E. Harney’s story,
“Blackfellow Different” (B, 11/6/’52),
when Peter built a house he was un-
able ever to live in it because his mother-
in-law took shelter from a storm
in the building. Granted that the
black couldn’t enter the house as
long as his mother-in-law remained
within it; yet as soon as she had gone
out of the building he would (or should)
have had the right to occupy it himself
Had a “boy” working for me once, and
his mother-in-law came along with other
members of the tribe, and camped on my
land. Both Joe and his mother-in-law
worked for me for a while, but their
dodging of one another was very comical,
and irritating, too, at times. Joe’s wife
would give the signal when ma-in-law
was near, and Joe would then dodge out
of the way. When, as sometimes hap-
pened, he couldn’t dodge, he would stand
in a corner of the building, face to the
wall, and eyes shut tight, while she
attended to her own jobs. As soon as
she left the room a whistle would sound
and Joe would then be free to move about
the place. He would never walk on
the same track as she followed, but keep
a little distance from it; and at night,
when she camped with her own relatives
at one end of the paddock, Joe and his
missus made their camp at another spot,
and he would sit carefully with his back
to his mother-in-law. But, save for their
never meeting or seeing one another,
there was apparently no other restriction
on them, and after the old lady left the
camp and went elsewhere, Joe joined in
with the rest of blacks and all shared
the one camp together. Of course, I
admit that Joe belonged to a different
tribe from that of which Harney’s Peter
was a member; yet I have always thought
the ma-in-law taboo was common to all.

“Bass”: A feature of skin-markets that
mystifies me is the short price offered for
cat-skins. The current price in Perth is
two-bob a dozen—and you couldn’t skin
a cat for that. But why aren’t cat-skins
wanted? Properly tanned and selected
they make a rug that’s stronger, warmer
land prettier than one made of any other
skin in Australia except, perhaps, that of
the native wildcat. I’ve just seen a rug
made of 30 matched tomcat-skins. Each
skin goes 15in. by 9in. When you’ve seen
a tanned tomcat-skin you realise why few
animals can rip a cat, and why even pigs,
which can tear a rabbit to pieces in
seconds, can’t make any impression on a
VM^ T£R
"Yes, sir. This modern stuff has the birds scared stiff.”
feline corpse. The pelt is a sixteenth of
an inch thick, and around the neck it
will go anything up to three-sixteenths.
I once struck a couple of rabbiters out
from Kununoppin (W.A.). They came
from Durham in the Old Dart, and they
were the hardest-living men I’ve met. A
knife, a billy and a frying-pan were all
the eating equipment they carried, and
they lived almost solely on rabbit. They
didn’t waste a thing. I’m not saying they
ate the odd cat they caught, but when
they left on a trip home they took with
them the finest rugs I’ve ever seen —and
couldn’t buy.

“Master Bevel”: The main topic at
smoke-oh was the boss’s recent win
in Tatts. Battler, just warned to slow
down and keep a bit closer to the skin,
was emphatic in his lurid comment that
the “So-and-so old coot ought to pay us
a tenner a hundred and tucker.” Most of
the boys were unanimous that if the luck
had been theirs they’d sling the combs
and cutters in the creek and retire. “What
would you do, Jimmy?” someone asked
the ringer. James didn’t hesitate. “I’d
buy five-thousand little weaners and have
a go at the flamin’ record! ”

“Swelpme”: I parked the towel,
strolled in for breakfast and was greeted
with a foolish smirk and one word:
“Rabbits.” My long-haired mate had
"I buried a bottle of Scotch. THAT makes him dig the garden.”
never shown such signs before, so I con-
cluded that I hadn’t heard correctly and
begged her pardon. There was no mis-
take. “Rabbits,” she repeated, the smirk
spreading. “Where?” I asked, wonder-
ing whether I should humor her if she
claimed that the pests were overrunning
the kitchen. “Nowhere, fathead, it’s the
first of August,” was the amazing answe .
“If you mean the first or April
began, and was interrupted with: 1
don’t; I mean it’s the first of the month,
Obviously one of us was mad. But
what’s that got to do with rabbits. i
demanded. “I don’t know,” came the
candid admission. “But the chap on the
wireless just said that if you say ‘rabbits’
to the first person you see on the first of
the month it will bring you luck.” I
think that radio-announcer had something.
To say “rabbits” to several cockies of my
acquaintance —just after the rabbit-
inspector had been around —would be to
touch off an explosion ; but one in par-
ticular I recall. The word tossed at him
before his breakfast cuppa would bring
the tosser luck all right—but it wouldn’t
be good luck.
* * * *
“Salmon Gums”: I’m all for progress,
so I’m looking forward to the finale of
a cropping experiment which, a Perth
daily says, is pending in W.A. We’re well
past the pioneering stages in aerial-spray-
ing of crops for weeds and wogs, and
one firm is going in for aerial-sowing.
This, my paper tells me, “would allow the
exploitation of rich lands too hard to get
at normally, either because it’s
uneconomical to clear the scrub or
because the land is hilly.” So they're
going to sow pasture crops? Not a bit
of it. The idea behind all this is to
“produce a wheat crop where wheat has
never grown before.” It’s going to be a
fine sight, watching that crop being
harvested.

“Oomalas” (New Britain): Kong
Kong, the celebrated rainmaker from the
Witu Group, worked on a plantation and
in his spare time conducted a weather
bureau. His office, a 6ft, by 6ft. grass
hut, in which hung charms of all descrip-
tions, was set up in the scrub and here
he interviewed his clients, who paid in
cash for advice and help— to offer native
foods in payment was an insult. He
made rain or prevented it according to
his clients’ requests. Maybe rain was
needed to plant “kau-kau” or taro on a
certain day, and perhaps on that day an-
other crowd wanted fine weather for a
“sing-sing.” Kong Kong took their money
and promised each according to their
desires. If rain fell and gladdened the
hearts of the agriculturists he could be
sure of extra cash and kudos from them,
and he would appease the “sing-sing”
crowd by telling them the Masalai
from Naraga had stolen his “fine-
weather” medicine during the night. This
Masalai took the form of a huge palai
(lizard) and was all-powerful. The dis-
appointed “sing-sing” crowd would pay
again and Kong Kong would have an-
other crack at it and sooner or later he
had to pick it. His excuse for failure
was always accepted.

“Gulliver”; Quite a few years before,
Larry had had a job near Wagin, in
Westralia’s south, and now, in the
nor’-west, he was still constantly and pro-
fanely wondering why he’d ever left it.
Down south, we heard over and over
again, there was real grass, not this
blasted saltbush, scrub, spinifex and sand ;
down south it rained regularly through-
out the year ; there was good clear water
everywhere; down south it was cool, it
was cold, you could sit over a fire at night
and “if ever I get away from this god-
forsaken place you’ll never see me
again.” Then one mail-day the miracle
happened and one of his letters to the
lost Paradise brought results in the shape
of an overseer’s job down south. So we
took him into town, rejoiced with him,
filled him —and ourselves—with vale-
dictory beer. All through a long and
Bacchic night we heard how he was going
to buy an oilskin and ride in the rain
through long green grass and fat stock,
and come
home t o
snooze be-
fore a roar-
ing fire,
and the
land of sin,
sorrow and
sweaty
sox could
go where it
should
have gone
long ago.
Loyal to the last, we dragged him from
the bar at sunrise to catch the steamer,
steered him, his two dogs and a caged
white cockatoo up the gangway. The
steamer whistled; the cocky echoed the
blast and made sheepyard noises; the
dogs barked ; the escort, reckless of its
thumping head, cheered. Larry cursed
all in sight, kicked the menagerie at
random and faded on the deck with one
foot stuck in the bird-cage. They were
all back six months later. Down south,
we learned, it never stopped raining, a
man was wet through the whole time and
frozen half the time, the piffling pad-
docks were so small you were opening
and shutting gates all day; when you
sent a dog round the wing of a mob he
went through three adjoining properties
if he was a good wide worker —-and talk-
ing to farmers gave you the pip. The
nor’-west, it appeared, was the only place
for a man of sense, judgment and dis-
crimination. It was all very funny at the
time —but now, with a New South Wales
westerly howling at the windows, frost
in the forecast and snow on the hills,
I’m right back where Larry started—
wondering.

“Eurimburra”: A fiasco of fine pro-
portions was that which accompanied the
importation into N.S.W. of 282 llamas,
vicunas and alpacas. It was in 1859
that the late Charles Ledger was hailed
almost as a national hero when he arrived
in Sydney with them after having
smuggled them out of Peru following a
nightmare journey over the Andes. Only
one, a llama, was born in this country,
but within a few months all were dead
from some form of parasite (probably
intestinal). Ledger’s story makes almost
unbelievable reading, for at a second
attempt, apparently to rehabilitate him-
self, he got away with about 1501 b. of
seed of the jealously-guarded quinine-tree.
His servant, a veritable Man Friday, was
caught and flogged to death. Ledger
offered some of the seed to the Queens-
land Government, which turned down his
scheme. What happened to the 501 b. of
it he sent the Government is a mystery.
The balance he sold, being almost
destitute, to Dutch and Indian planters,
and it is from that seed that the great
plantations of Cinchona ledgeriana have
sprung, bringing millions to their owners.
Chas. Ledger died at Leichhardt, Sydney,
in 1907; he’d had a pension of £2 per
week given him by the grateful Dutch.
The Indian Government flatly refused to
grant him a bob.
A SCULPTOR OF SHEEP.
I am a sculptor of sheep—
My mallet lies in the mare I ride,
My dog the chisel of my command;
And all I am—the hand to guide.
My medium about me spreads,
White on a plinth of gilded grass,
Peace in the arc of sun-bent heads.
I break the mass of a solid wing,
Chiselling curves with a casting dog,
And watch the shadows their contours fling;
And ah—the beauty of camping flock.
Symbolic grace of folded knees
And flowing line from haunch to hock.
And what’s to tell, as I careless go,
Riding, singing, flicking my whip,
Across the plains of my studio —
I am a sculptor of sheep?

PINCHED J. BULL.
Britain’s latest serious
economic crisis, which enforced
the call to London of Mr.
Menzies and other Dominion
leaders, has been explained
from the highly important U.S.
point of view by leading Ameri-
can writer on foreign affairs
Walter Lippmann, in New York
“Herald Tribune”;
“The military and political
commitments of Great Britain
are costing more than Great
Britain is now able to earn. The
big expensive commitments are
the war in Malaya, the military
establishment in the Middle
East, the rearmament of Great
Britain.
“A year hence under present
plans the British N.A.T.O. forces
in Germany, which are now paid
for by the Germans as occupa-
tion costs, will become a British
charge. There are other expen-
ditures which, taken together,
add up to a quite considerable
sum—such as the British contri-
bution in Korea, Hong Kong,
subsidies to African and other
colonies—all of them now in
principle part of the British sec-
tor in carrying out the policy of
global containment.”
Barely Solvent
Britain Lippmann assesses as
just barely solvent, despite severe
restrictions on imports, Ameri-
can aid, and the extending of
the rearmament programme.
And even bare solvency is
due to artificial and probably
quite transitory circumstances
and devices; he thinks it can
last until not later than the time
now set for the Dominion leaders
to be in Britain (November).
“Unless something radically
new develops, it cannot be
counted on to last very much
longer than that. Nor is it likely
that any British Government
could make Britain solvent by
reducing very much further the
standard of life of the British
people. No doubt a good deal
can be done by disinflation. But
... . the British are just about at
the point where, if serious re-
ductions are necessary, they will
have to come out of the mili-
tary and diplomatic foreign
commitments of Great Britain
and not out of the standard of
living in the British Isles.”
Lippmann foresees another
call on America, and the need
there for a drastic change from
the present “unstable system of
trade based on annual crises.”
In further comment, with per-
haps a bearing on the November
conference-date, he sees Britain
(with France also in the same’
pickle) doing its utmost “to get
along for a while by delaying,
postponing, stretching out, hold-
ing breath and treading water” in
order not to embarrass Ameri-
cans during the Presidential
election.
“Moral Failure”
Agreeing with Lippmann that
“a new crisis in 1953 is
inevitable,” London “News
Chronicle’s” financial editor
says:
“It would in the first instance
be a balance-of-payments crisis,
a gold-reserve crisis, leading to a
devaluation of sterling. But from
our past experience we know
that it would be much more than
this —a political and social crisis,
a standard-of-living crisis, a
‘class’ crisis.”
He does not agree that
Britain is strained to the limit of
effort. “I do not believe,” he
says, “that it would inflict notice-
able hardship on our population
or any section of it if they agreed
to consume 3 per cent, less and
to produce 3 per cent, more than
they now do.
“That is the order of what is
necessary on the material plane
to eliminate the ‘gap’ and restore
our national solvency. It is a
mere trifle. The trouble is on
the moral plane. The will is
apparently not there to put in
that bit of extra effort and
tighten the belt that extra quarter
of an inch.”
On the contrary, London
“Spectator” notes that, while
the unions are pressing for wage-
increases which would mean
either prices having to go up as
never before or firms shutting
down wholesale and consequent
unemployment, “no union talks
of an increase in real output to
match the increase in incomes.”
Socialist Legacy
Also on this aspect, Edinburgh
“Scotsman” seeks an explanation
for the failure of national leaders
to convince British workers that
they must get their jackets off
and “go to it.” One reason, it
suggests, could be that predic-
tions of crises have never been
realised in practice: “Indeed, the
term has been used so frequently
that the ordinary man pays little
heed to it,”
They’ve cried “Wolf!” too
often ; but this time, all accounts
agree, it’s a very real wolf. The
differences are over how to get
rid of him.
“The problem of responsible
government in Britain today,”
says London “Daily Telegraph,”
“is to strike a balance between
the needs of defence and of
exports.”
It ridicules present Socialist
policy as based on the slogan
“Dentures, not Defence,” with
“the Welfare State” treated as “a
sacred cow,” and it quotes the
recent findings of an interna-
tional group of experts, issued
by the Organisation for Euro-
pean Economic Co-operation, to
this effect:
“They say bluntly that Great
Britain’s troubles are largely the
result of Socialist policy from
1945 to 1950. At a time when it.
was desirable to ease the internal
pressure for goods, the Socialists
stepped up the pressure. When
they should have been erecting a
dam against excessive credit
facilities, they opened the flood-
gates of cheap and easy money.
In a period of overfull employ-
ment they applied the precepts
appropriate to mass unemploy-
ment. They failed the country
ingloriously.”
Europe's Rising Army.
“The new [European] army
truly represents something new
under the sun,” says “New York
Times,” and, adds “Manchester
Guardian,” “As a military organ-
isation it has every chance of
being efficient.”
In many ways (the “Guardian”
has noted) it is very different
from the original idea. For one
thing, instead of an incredibly
complicated mixing of men
speaking different languages, its
national units will be divisions
in everything but name.
The system is to be so flexible
that in case of “tactical and
organisational necessity” a com-
plete corps can be formed from
one nationality.
There is further flexibility in
that units of the European army
can, when necessary, be intro-
duced into British or American
corps, and in the same way
British and American divisions
can come under European corps
command.
Instead of limiting German
officers to commanding nothing
larger than a battalion or
brigade, the treaty allows them
to be eligible for any appoint-
ment on an equal basis, and
General Staffs will include Ger-
man members.
Uniforms, although they will
have a common pattern, will
London “Daily Express.”
FRANCE: "I don’t know what effect he’ll have on the enemy , but
by heavens he frightens ME !”
not apparently be strictly of one
kind; caps and badges dear to
old regiments can continue to
be worn. An important provi-
sion is an equal period of con-
scription in every country as
soon as practicable.
“Altogether,” comments
“Manchester Guardian,” “the
arrangements seem sensible and
workmanlike —infinitely more so
than the original outline. Here
we have the bundle of tough
faggots which Mr. Churchill
wanted, not the pile of dry kind-
ling which was offered 18 months
ago.”
Another stipulation (noted by
“New York Times”) is that no
atomic or chemical weapons, air-
craft or heavy war vessels will
be permitted to be built in
“strategically exposed” areas,
meaning Germany.
On Germany’s share, London
“Economist” reports that there
are to be 12 German units, com-
prising altogether about half a
million men. The units, or divi-
sions, will be formed in the first
place out of the cadres of pro-
fessional soldiers, who will have
to be retrained to use the latest
types of arms. About 100,000
professionals will train 400,000
conscripts. A conscription law
will be introduced as soon as
the European Defence Com-
munity treaty is ratified.
Also, the “Economist” con-
siders it fairly certain that some
German plants will produce
some types of weapons :
“One factor which will tend
to foster a new arms industry
is the Germans’ determination
that their troops shall have the
best weapons, and their convic-
tion that some American equip-
ment is not so good as that used
by the Wehrmacht. They are
sure that some German infantry
weapons are superior to anything
produced elsewhere, and German
tanks used in the latter part of
the war are also thought in some
quarters to be better than any-
thing the American forces have
on show in Germany.”
Various Voices.
British Colonial Secretary,
Lyttelton ; “If you were to grant
self-government in an instru-
ment tomorrow in Malaya, the
country in six months would be
plunged into such racial strife,
conflict and confusion as we have
never seen.”
James Robinson {American
Mutual Security Agency
administrator in Burma) : “All I
want is to grow these fellows
better pigs. But hell, all they
want to do is talk politics. Why,
I don’t even understand
American politics,”
Adenauer (having emphasised
the evils nationalisn } had inflicted
on the world-first through the
Napoleonic wars and later
through “the orgy of National
Socialism” in Germany) : “A
third peak of nationalistic think-
ing is Soviet Russia, which has
similarly brought endless sorrow
to humanity already, and will
bring still greater evil if it is not
possible to build a dam against
it.”
Truman : “Danger lies in be-
lieving wrongly that we are
weak. Our strength commences
with knowing that we are strong
—and becoming stronger.”
U.S. ex-President Hoover:
“How many mistakes do we
[Americans] have to make before
we learn that our genius lies in
the invention and production and
operation of great weapons?
Our future is in these great
weapons, not in bayonets.”
Cricketer Walter Hammond:
“The man who used to eat 51b.
of prime English meat a week
before the war simply cannot
bowl the same way on £lb. of
stringy Argentine cow. Through-
out English cricket a slower and
quieter standard has been
accepted, to correspond with the
food we are given. So Test series
are lost, and no one need wonder
why.”
Churchill ( in the House of
Commons ): “We look forward
to the moment when we shall be
able to ram red meat down your
throats.”
General Van Fleet, com-
mander of the U.N.O. ground
forces in Korea: “The rainy
season is in our favor. All our
main bridges and roads are in
good shape. We have ample
stocks in forward areas, and we
were prepared for the rainy
season. The enemy is not; he
is in bad shape when it comes to
floods.”
T. S. Eliot {as president of
London Library) : “Great
private libraries have had their
day, and even modest private
libraries are rarities” (presum-
ably in London).
Matsumoto, Japanese Am-
bassador in London: “One
reason why we hear much about
Japanese competition is that
English people generally hold the
view that Japanese goods are
cheap, and the standard of
living low. The fact is, the cost
of living in Japan is very high.
Another somewhat popular mis-
conception is that slave-labor
conditions prevail in Japan; but
although we do not have foot-
ball pools, it does not follow
that we work 24 hours a day.
Japan’s labor legislation has been
established along the lines of
the most modern example in the
world.”
Labor member of the Com-
mons, Denis Healey: “I wish
sometimes that some of my right
honorable and honorable friends
could make one-tenth of the
effort to understand America’s
attitude towards China which
they rightly make to understand-
ing China’s attitude towards the
United States.”

"On Borrowed Time."
Paul Osborn’s fantasy, “On
Borrowed Time” (from L. E.
Watkin’s novel), is one of those
sentimental little folk-tale ex-
cursions into the supernatural,
rather after the manner of
Stephen Vincent Benet, though
not quite up to that author’s
standards. It has to do with,
an honest and cussing old
farmer who, sensing his time is
nearly up and anxious that his
orphaned grandson should not
fall into the clutches of a
vinegary and avaricious aunt,
contrives to corner Death, in the
person of a mysterious visitor
called Mr. Brink, up an en-
chanted apple-tree and keep him
there.
The Mercury Theatre is pre-
senting the piece under Wini-
fred Hindle’s direction at the
St. James Hall, Sydney, and ex-
tracting a good deal of humor
and emotion from it, if not quite
the essential spirit and atmos-
phere—a lot of nonsense about
the American scene comes out
of Hollywood, but the film of
this play, or of Benet’s “The
Devil and Daniel Webster,”
gave a pretty good indication of
the charming, if slightly weird,
folk-story atmosphere that is
necessary.
John Brunskill, in the Mer-
cury production, has a whale of
a time as the old farmer who
finds himself with an apple-tree
from which no one can climb
down until he lets them, and
who, having enticed the invisible
and inaudible Mr. Brink into
its branches and thus stayed the
hand of death all over the world,
suddenly finds it necessary to
prove his sanity by sundry un-
orthodox and alarming mea-
sures. Brunskill gets deep
enough into the character to give
it considerable feeling and
honesty, and, indeed, without
his performance, the production
would be rather lost.
The person of Mr. Brink,
taking the excellent standard set
by Sir Cedric Hardwicke, calls
for suggestions of mysterious
omnipotence, of dignity and
sincerity and infinite gentleness.
John Barnard doesn’t meet the
order —a shallow cheeriness and
an insinuating quality with an
underlying falseness seem, to be
about as far as he can go with
the role. Apart from other
items, that shortcoming also
costs three or four scenes the
full value of the contrast be-
tween the old scamp of a
farmer and the immense and
mysterious power that sits
trapped in his apple-tree.
Camilla Moxham makes an
intelligent and appealing
youngster of young Pud, and
Reginald Lye, as the doctor who
at first disbelieves and then dis-
covers that Death is indeed out
of action for a time, gets some
humor and human feeling into
his acting. The rest of the cast,
while they portray their feelings
well enough, are a little too
obvious in their efforts to take
on character.
Wagner and Berlioz.
At last Eugene Goossens gave
a Sydney audience —in the Red
series of the subscription con-
certs last week —a programme at
which nobody could fairly cavil.
Two composers only were pre-
sented, and they were orchestra-
tors without peer; Wagner and
Berlioz.
When he wrote his “Tristan
and Isolde” the German not only
established a splendid new
standard for the lyric stage but
opened up a new world of
chromatic harmony, to which the
incomparable Prelude points the
way. This was played by the
orchestra with style and polish.
The Venusberg music from
“Tannhauser,” the very acme of
voluptuousness, had the benefit
of some well-disciplined off-
stage work by the Conserva-
torium choir. There were times,
however, when the sensuousness
of the high strings came near to
being swamped by the rest of
the orchestral weight. The
beauty of chordal harmony in
the “Siegfried Idyll” was given
its just due, whilst the Magic
Fire music from “The Val-
kyries” was a spectacular back-
ground for some powerful de-
clamatory singing by Norman
Walker, whose bass is of a
quality and flexibility well able
to cope with the exacting de-
mands of “Wotan’s Farewell.”
The phrase which Schumann
applied to Schubert’s great C
Major Symphony—“of a hea-
venly length”—would not be out
of place applied tb Berlioz’s
“Harold in Italy” Symphony.
Throughout its 45 minutes —the
same running time as the
Schubert —this beautiful work
has many wonderful transfor-
mations xff harmonic color, and
never once does the inspira-
tional pressure flag, Robert
Pikler brought a fine singing
tone to the solo viola, which
supplies a strong melodic thread
through the texture. Though
programmatic, Byron’s hero can
here be forgotten; the music
can be listened to as enjoy ably
as anything abstract that has
ever been written.
Marie Collier, the find of the
last grand-opera season of the
Melbourne National Theatre,
was the chief singer at a benefit
concert at the Hawthorn Town
Hall on a recent evening, and
the strength, color and imagina-
tive quality of her singing of the
“Ah Perfido” of Beethoven
justified the confidence of
people that she will get into the
Melba class one of these days.
If she doesn’t it won’t be be-
cause of a lack of natural talent.
She is 24, has a dramatic
soprano and the intelligence to
use it,
* * * *
The latest of the youth series
of concerts under the Castro
baton at the Melbourne Town
Hall excelled all previous ex-
amples. The Argentinian con-
ductor produced out of his
orchestra a masterly perform-
ance of the “Martyrdom of St.
Sebastian” of Debussy and a
smooth one of Rossini’s “The
Silken Ladder,” while young
Paul Badura-Skoda lifted the
evening to even more exalted
levels with his inspired col-
laboration in Schubert’s Adagio
and Concertante in F. He fol-
lowed that with a remarkable
performance of the solo part in
Liszt’s Piano Concerto in E Flat
Major, packing it with melody
from start to finish. And not a
word was spoken,
* * * *
Very few artists have the
allure of Victoria Anderson and
Viola Morris, the two Australian
duettists who have been enter-
taining audiences that should
have been 10 times bigger at
the Assembly Hall in Melbourne
with a repertoire of songs that
range through the whole gamut,
ancient and modern. A perfect
team, their voices blend together
like a couple of good wines
which, for some reason, supple-
ment each other. There was an
extraordinary richness in their
singing of the 18th-century
songs of Purcell and the 19th-
century songs of Schumann,
Franck, Dvorak and Duparc,
and their solo work was as fine
as their work in combination.
Art.
The Independent Group of
Artists, who are holding their
show this year at the Peter Bray
Gallery in Melbourne, show
their independence in all sorts
of ways. Eveline Syme shows
complete independence of
Nature in her “Road to Bacchus
IVlarsh,” where she would have
us believe that the hills are com-
posed of inflated motor-tyres,
and Edith Alsop shows hers in
her “Market Garden” by follow-
ing after Van Gogh, though a
long way after. There is some
sensitiveness in R. Malcolm
Warner’s “Foothills of the
Rockies” and “Nightfall, Lake
Nagambie,” and there is the
quality of light in the “Carni-
val” of Dora Serle; but there
is none in the batch sent by
Phyl Waterhouse from Europe.
Lina Bryans is not as well repre-
sented as usual.

Following culmination of the inflationary
boom during the first quarter of 1951,
big and significant changes have occurred
in Australia’s economic and financial
position, and the immediate national out-
look bristles with difficulties. In the
monetary and banking fields two major
. influences have been at work: one, the
balance-of-payments crisis, has been
restrictive, and the other, growth of bank
advances, expansive. If the heavy out-
flow of money occasioned by the large
deficit on external account had not been
largely offset by a rapid internal expansion
of credit, there would have been a much
more damaging contraction in the money
supply than has thus far been experi-
enced.
The changes were heralded by the fall
in wool prices, which brought down Aus-
tralia’s cheque for the staple for 1951-52
(£307.7 million) by £328,6 million, or
51.6 p.c. On top of this sharp drop in
export income came a spate of imports.
The combined result was an adverse
balance in our overseas trade account of
£377.6 million, which is the measure of
the drain on our foreign balances, or
London funds. This and its corollary, a
drop in bank deposits, exerted a strong
deflationary influence. Moreover, traders
were caught with heavy commitments at
a time when the public was becoming
purchase-shy, and retail sales therefore
beginning to slacken.
Fortunately the banking structure was
well equipped to come to the rescue and
prevent a financial crisis through possible
business failures and loss of confidence.
But the bulk of the trading banks’
liquidity was frozen on special account
with the Commonwealth Bank. The in-
itiative in this matter therefore lay with
the central bank, which is the executive
instrument of Government policy in the
money and credit field. The central bank
rose to the occasion by progressive re-
leases of these special deposits and by
liberalising to some extent its directives
on advance policy; there has been no
departure from the general principle of
the 1950 directive “to reduce still further
the dependence of industry, commerce
and agriculture on the banking system.”
So, with limited exceptions, customers
are still required to seek finance outside
the banking system for working capital
that could be classified as “non-fluctuat-
ing.”
The amount of trading-bank deposits
frozen on special account with the Com-
monwealth Bank fell from £572.6 million
in June, 1951, to £305 million in June,
1952, and to £219.7 million on July 16.
Nevertheless, credit is still relatively tight,
and likely to remain so for some time,
because the building-up of bank deposits,
and with them bank liquidity ratios, looks
like being a slow process, especially
during the off-season for exports. This
and other things eliminate any danger
there might have been of an unstable
situation being prolonged by easy-money
conditions.
For the banks it meant bigger business
and increased risks. After allowing for
contingencies, the improvement in the
C.B.A.’s gross earnings (£4,543,957) was
£737,778. But the cost of conducting
the business (£3,658,469, up £634,674)
took 80.5 p.c. of gross earnings as against
79.4 p.c. in the previous year, and an
extra £98,553 was set aside for taxation
(£544,925). Declared profit was thus
only £4551 better at £340,563, which was
a moderate 5.2 p.c. on shareholders’ funds
(capital and reserves combined), or enough
to pay the prefs. their 4 p.c. (£84,694)
and show 12.8 p.c. on ord. capital as
against 12.5, 12.5, 11.7 and 10.8 p.c.
back to 1948. The div. was kept at
10 p.c., which is worth only half that
rate on most of the ord. capital, which
was issued at a premium of 100 p.c.
The year’s contraction of £5,713,653
in the co.’s deposits, etc. —the etcetera in-
cludes unspecified provision for taxation
and contingencies—and of £6,429,018 in
balances due to other banks was accom-
panied by expansions of £7,667,970 in
advances and of £5,525,218 in liquids,
all made possible by a reduction of
£26,200,000 in the amount on special
deposit with the Commonwealth Bank:

Subject to further releases from the
special deposit with the C. 8., the co. was
still in a position to further assist clients
within the general framework of credit
policy as stated above.
Since the close of accounts the rates
of interest charged for and paid on
advances and deposits have been in-
creased ; but it is doubtful whether the
net gain will much more than offset the
growth in wage and other costs, which is
the major problem of the whole economy
at the moment. The Budget, which has
given welcome but small relief from the
tax burden, should have an overall steady-
ing effect, and import restrictions con-
tinue —they relieved -the drain on London
funds and reduced the threat from over-
seas competition.
The market, which doesn’t expect the
10 p.c. div. to be interfered with, prices
the f.-p. 10s. ords, at 21s. 9d. (275. 6d. a

By confining its underwriting activities
to the Commonwealth, except for
marine business, the 74-year-old Mercan-
tile hasn’t missed much. Since 1946 the
co.’s net premium income has grown by
over 377 p.c., the overall loss experience
has been favorable and a tight hold has
been kept upon controllable outgoings,
which has meant satisfactory underwrit-
ing results. And those on the share
register have joined in the prosperity.
Besides lifts in the div. from 9 p.c. in
1946 to 12y p.c. for the four years to
the close of last accounts, they have put
up £350,000 of fresh capital, which
brought with it £250,000 of share
premiums, since April, 1950.
It was then that the remaining 4s.
(£100,000) was called on the 500,000 old
shares, making them f.-p. to £1 each ;
and in August, 1951, half a million new
£1 shares were issued at a premium of
10s. each. When the books were ruled
off at June 30 last the premiums, which
have been added to reserves, and 10s. a
share (£250,000) of the capital had come
in, making paid capital £750,000 in
1.000. £1 shares, of which one half are
f.p. and the other half paid to 10s. each.
The remaining 10s, a share on the con-
tribs. will be asked for as and - when
required.
Despite the unprofitable nature of
motor-vehicle and third-party contracts —
due to the mounting tide of road
accidents, heavy damages awarded by
juries for personal injury, and rising cost
of repairs—last term’s overall underwrit-
ing experience was a satisfactory one.
The business kept on expanding.
Gross premium income shot up by
£757,296, reaching a record £2,793,077,
of which 48.7 p.c. (£1,362,076) was
reinsured as against 50 p.c. in the previous
term. The improvement in net premiums
was thus £416,488:

Claims ran away with an extra £5 2s, p.c.,
for reasons already explained. The
pleasing feature was that the bigger busi-
ness was written at £3 16s. p.c. less cost,
notwithstanding the steep rise in wage-
rates.
The gross underwriting surplus was
£265,640 (up £64,330), of which £163,000
was earmarked for unexpired risks,
making the reserve for this purpose
£573,000, equal to 40 p.c. of the year’s
net premiums, which is usually considered
adequate for the purpose. The net under-
writing result was therefore £102,640
(down £470), to which net interest, rents,
etc., added £45,033 (up £6771), making
the total net amount available for distri-
bution £147,673. That was 19.7 p.c. on
paid capital as it now stands compared
with 28.2, 24.7, 21.9 and 16.2 p.c. back
to 1948.

The holdings of Government securities
(up £578,188) and cash (up £147,796) were
together over 3| times greater than last
term’s total claims.
Maintenance of the p.c. div.—-it
now calls for £48,717 more than last
term’s net return from investments —will
depend upon the underwriting experience.
Although premium-rates for motor-
vehicle and third-party risks have been
substantially increased over the last 12
months, doubts are whether resultant
increase in income will more than offset
the continuing growth in claims. The
effect of the large amounts now awarded
by juries for personal injuries “requires
a great deal more than the granting of
increased premium-rates,” the chairman
says. One overseas co. operating here
has already refused to accept certain
classes of third-party risks, as well as
liability for claims under £lO.
At 595. the Mercantile’s f.-p. £1 shares
return 4.2 p.c. on a 12i p.c. div. basis,
which the market obviously doesn’t expect
to be interfered with. On the same basis
the 10s.-paid contribs. at 365. give an
immediate return of 3.4 p.c., or 5.4 p.c.
when fully paid. Including uncalled
capital and the reserve for unexpired
risks, net tangible cover is 475. 4d.

value, and worth a lot more than that)
and shares in other cos. (£133,496).
Last term the refinery was “fully
employed,” and the distillery “had a
profitable year notwithstanding that its
operations were hampered by transport
difficulties.” But a dry spell in the sugar-
belt reduced the quantity of cane put
through the rollers (245,340 tons, down
140,601 tons) and the outturn of raws
(31,095 tons, down 14,091 tons). The
lower production and persistent rise in
costs were partly offset by better prices in
both the home (£33 145., up £9 17s. per
ton) and export (£36 155., up £3 19s. per
ton) markets. The overall average price
for the season was £6 10s. 4d. better at
£34 7s. 6d. per ton.
Including a windfall of £9920 received
from the British Ministry of Food on
account of sugar sold to Canada, declared
profit was only £3092 short of the 1951
figure at £85,465. That was after allow-
ing whatever was considered necessary
for taxation and £42,550 (up £989) for
depreciation, and leaves out of the
reckoning £20,000 taken from inner
reserves and placed in the window. The
£85,465 was 17.1 p.c. on capital as against
17.7, 17.6, 20.9, 16.9 and 4.7 p.c. back to
1947, when a severe drought and damag-
ing winter frosts played havoc with the
figures. The distribution, steady at 11 p.c.
for the 11 years to 1948, has been main-
tained at 13 p.c. since, of which 5 p.c. is
labelled bonus.
The outlook for the industry is one of
increasing production and sales, thanks
largely to the currency problem,
which has neutralised the effect of
surplus production in the dollar area
upon sterling markets. The new
eight-year sugar pact with the U.K. pro-
vides for the export of over 600,000 tons
raws p.a., or 200,000-odd tons more than
formerly, and the Central Cane Board
has lifted individual mill peaks accord-
ingly. Miilaquin’s peak figure has been
raised from 31,000 tons for 1952 to
37,000 tons for 1954, and additional plant
and equipment is being installed to cope
with th£ increase:

A progress report from the A.C.A. . .
As Managing Director, I am delighted to be able to report to the multitude
of policyholders and friends of the A.C.A. that the results for the year ended
the 30th June, 1952, have eclipsed all previous record results which your
Company has established. lam most conscious of the fact that these results
would be utterly impossible of attainment if it were not for the loyal support
and able co-operation which is extended by policyholders and staff to your
A.C.A. Being conscious of these facts, I hold it a real duty and a great
pleasure to take this opportunity of thanking all of the supporters of the A.C.A.
and every member of its staff for the loyal support and excellent co-operation
which it enjoys.
In the Ordinary Life Department new policies issued during the year ended
the 30th June, 1952, exceeded the great amount of ONE MILLION, TWO
HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS (£1,200,000) which is nearly twice the
total for any previous year.
In the Fire, Accident and General Insurance Departments truly astonishing
increases in premium income have been recorded and thus we have been
given the opportunity of 'ensuring that our policyholders can enjoy peace of
mind not only because they have Good Policies on their lives but also because
they have Good Policies protecting their properties and persons from the
innumerable hazards which exist in our daily life.
When it is remembered that we started in 1921 and that, therefore, we are
only a young Company the underwriting of business in such large amounts is
indeed proof of our just claim that
“A.C.A. Policies are Good Policies.”
D. J. MOONEY,
Managing' Director.

on plant, etc., than was written
off. To do this and carry an
extra £156,904 of stocks the co.
drew upon cash for £162,837
and added only £57,830 to the
outside debt.
As for the current term, the
drought broke in March last,
and the Queensland outturn of
raws for the 1952 season is ex-
pected to reach 800,000 tons, or
109.000 tons more than for the
season on whose heels it treads.
Home consumption is running
at around 550,000 tons p.a., and
increasing at the rate of some
15.000 tons p.a., which means
that only about half the export
quota will be filled this year.
The trouble is that costs have
overtaken the controlled home-
consumption price again;
growers and millers have asked for
more, and they have a strong case.
In 1946 they received 62
p.c. of the retail price whereas
their proportion today is only
53 p.c. Profits earned this year
by those at the growing and
milling end of the industry will
depend in no small measure on
the speed with which an ade-
quate selling-price is granted in
the home market. The Govern-
ment, which granted an interim
increase of Id. per pound in the
selling-price of fines in March,
is now considering the report of
a committee which is set up to
examine the whole question be-
fore deciding upon the total and
final amount of increase.
The market, which has always
had a high opinion of the scrip,
prices the pound shares at 545.
(775. a year ago) to return 4.8
p.c. on a 13 p.c. div. basis. Net
tangible cover (book-value) is
425. 4d.
Centra] Norseman Gold
This co., now the star per-
former of the four gold-produc-
ing concerns in Western Mining
Corp.’s stable, works the
Phoenix, Princess Royal and
Lady Miller mines at Norseman
(W.A.). It is just beginning to
reap the benefit of recent heavy
expenditure on development and
shaft-sinking, target of which
was higher-grade ore at depth.
It was a rise in grade of mill-
feed, helped by sale of the
yellow metal on the free market
at a premium for the five months
to March last, that put the
spring of £92,058 into last term’s
net earnings:

respectively for 1951, the extrac-
tion being 1.7 p.c. better at
95 p.c. About 72 p.c. of the ore
came from the Phoenix, and was
hauled through the new Regent
shaft, which has been deepened
a further 435 ft. to No. 33 level.
Costs (mining, milling and
development) increased by 9.15.,
reaching 78.25. per ton.
The £207,987 of profit was
32 p.c. on capital as against
18.6 p.c. for the previous term.
The 10 p.c. div. paid during the
year has been followed by
another of 20 p.c. (£130,000) sent
out in June last. The profit
benefited by £26,527 (about £1
an ounce) from sales of gold on
the free market. That was at
the rate of £63,666 p.a., which
would more than offset the year’s
growth in expenditure on mining
and treatment (£481,995, up
£46,413). Outlay on develop-
ment was £100,634 (up £4429),
the footage being 9036 ft. (up
3327 ft.), mostly on the Mararoa
vein, which is serviced by the
Regent shaft.
At last two balancing-dates
ore reserves and grades compare
as follows:

Total .. 295,000 7.4 328, 000’ 8.5
There is thus over two years’
work for the mill measured up,
and developments in the Phoenix
and Princess Royal have dis-
closed some better than run-of-
mine ore.
When the books closed there
was £112,728 to come in respect
of gold sold or in course of
realisation. Current liabilities
totalled £46,168. Paid capital is
£650,000 in f.-p. ss. shares, of
which Western Mining Corp.
holds 51 p.c. The market prices
the scrip at 16s. 7d. as against
12s. 6d. a year ago.
The future of Wellington
Alluvials, Ltd., whose big
electric dredge is digging aurifer-
ous flats on the Macquarie
River (N.S.W.), depends upon
the co.’s success or otherwise in
obtaining enough financial
assistance to tide it over the
next 18 months or so. During
this time the dredge will be
digging its way through unprofit-
able ground, averaging about
1.14 gr., toward an area esti-
mated to contain 34,000,000 c.y.,
averaging 3gr., which could be
worked at a profit under exist-
ing conditions. Meanwhile the
two imponderables are the ex-
tent to which costs might rise
and whether the price of gold
will be increased. Operations
for the year to April 30 last
resulted in a loss of £46,073
compared with a loss of £26,744
for the preceding year. Re-
coveries averaged 1.53gf., or
11.83 d., per c.y., but costs were
13.37 d. When the books closed
cash and debtors’ balances
totalled £10,786 and current
liabilities £19,915. Paid capital
is £250,000 in 2s. shares, which
the market recently priced at
Is. 9d. each.


Women's Letters
From Melbourne
This month’s luncheon of the English-
Speaking Union had quite a distinction:
the presence of three judges of the
Supreme Court—Sir Charles Lowe, Sir
Edmund Herring and Mr. Justice Shoil
—and of English actress Jessie Matthews,
who, instead of making a speech, invited
questions, and her answers to those fired
at her kept everybody agreeably enter-
tained. Of herself Jessie said that she’s
planning to take off 14 pounds, have her
hair cut and “be a really skinny boy
for my next role” —she hopes to play
Peter Pan —and said slyly: “Possibly the
oldest one ever.” Among others at the
luncheon were the Colin Mackays, Mrs.
A, G. Hunter, Mrs. T. J. Ryan and Mrs.
Graham Egerton.
Margaret Mary McKinnon, who died
at Hopkins Point, near Warrnambool
(Vic.), at the age of 75, won fame at the
beginning of the century when, as
Margaret Maguire, daughter of a pioneer-
settler of the district, she put the dairy
produce of her father’s property, Tara,
Garvoc (Vic.), on the map. While still
quite a young girl she was noted for her
cheese- and butter-making. The Tara
herd of 150 cows was a fine one, and for
years Margaret made a daily average of
nine 401 b. cheeses. For export purposes
she also made 801 b. cheeses, and with
one of the latter beat all-comers in the
class for export cheese at the great
A.N.A. Exhibition of 1908. The butter,
which she also made, was tinned and
exported for sale to Western Australia,
where there was a big market for it.
Margaret Murdoch’s new Club
D’Orsay, which opened with a gala night
at the Eden Cabaret, brings a little bit
of Paris to St. Kilda. A backdrop, which
features the gaily-striped faqade of the
Cafe de Paris, made a fitting background
for the can-can dancers, the artists who
sang French songs and the excellent
French food served. The French Consul,
M. Gerard Sirot, and his wife were in
a party which included the Consul for
Switzerland, M. Paul-Emile Cattin, and
Madame Cattin, and the Consul for
Belgium, M. Rene Vanderkelen. Members
of Margaret’s family rallied round ; they
included her uncle, Sir Keith Murdoch,
and Lady Murdoch, whose slim graceful
gown was of black crepe, and Mrs.
Geoffrey Handbury, Margaret’s cousin,
and her husband. Mrs. Gordon Coulter’s
frock was of American-beauty French
crepe, Mrs. Frank May’s of black velvet.
Madame Bascourret-de-Gueraldi was
guest-of-honor at a reception given by
Prof. Sir Bernard Heinze in the Melba
Hall. Madame is chief teacher for Alfred
Cortot, and is a professor and chief
teacher of the piano at the Ecole Normale
de Musique in Paris. In the absence
of Lady Heinze, Mrs. J. H. Cook received
the guests. The guest-of-honor wore a
gown of black nylon, her daughter Lucille
a very wide skirt of gold lame and a
black tulle bodice massed with multi-
colored sequins. Many Conservatorium
students were at the reception, and
students Ruth Farren-Price, Margaret
Herm, Rosemary Hole and Donald West-
lake provided the music.
A day of blue sky and sunshine
brought spring suits to Flemington for
the Melbourne Racing Club’s Anniversary
meeting. The wife of the acting chairman
of the club, Mrs. P. W. Mein, enter-
tained at luncheon, and among her guests
were Lady Collins, Mrs. Henry Stebbins,
Mrs. Harold Rabling, Mrs. R. Owens, a
visitor from the U.S., and Mrs. A. G.
Hunter. There were many large hats
worn and yellow in all its tonings was
used either as accessories or as posies
pinned in the lapels of suits. Sheila
Scottar wore a charcoal-grey suit, the
jacket having the new dropped belt at
the back ; her Greta Garbo hat was in
black felt. Pat Garvin (Sydney) had
a wide-brimmed black felt hat to go with
her black suit. Mrs. J. Reilly, also in a
black suit, wore a small hat which had
bands of scarlet velvet and small black
ospreys. A snow-leopard fur collar
highlighted the beige coat worn by Mrs.
L. R. Buxton with her small forward-
tilted hat in beige melusine. A posy of
bright yellow clover matched the sweater
Mrs. Gerald Alderton wore with her grey
suit and hat. Mrs. Tom Staughton’s
grey suit had a pleated skirt; she used
Parma violets and scarf to gain contrast.
Mrs. Noel Calvert combined tiny white
cloche and grey suit.
There were more than 50 guests for the
party given by Mrs. S. Bak in her East
St. Kilda home to celebrate the
birthday anniversary of Alyce- Wyatt,
former stage and screen actress. The
hostess wore black crepe patterned with
a taffeta spot. The guest-of-honor’s
crepes were junior blue, her coat beige
wool angora. With her black suit Mrs.
S. Aarons wore a primrose-yellow cloche
studded with black sequins. Mrs. N.
Lynch had a matching pink hat to go
with her dusty-pink, black-patterned
faille frock. Mrs. Frank Marland’s
black cloth coat had a nipped-in waist-
line and very full skirt and was worn
with a winter-white melusine hat. A
deep-red felt toque topped Mrs. Con-
stance Day’s dyed-ermine coat. Mrs.
John Ingleton was in turquoise-blue
feather-cap and black Persian-lamb-
trimmed coat. Mrs. A. A. Davison’s
choice was junior-blue crepe contrasted
with a powder-blue head-hugging hat.
Mrs. Joe O’Collins wore a grey suit and
matching felt hat, and Helen McDonald,
from Ferny Creek, black with an azure-
blue hat. Mrs. Norman Bennett’s tiny
black-velvet bonnet went with a simple
black tailored frock.
This is Mrs. R. G. Casey, wife of the
Minister for External Affairs. Mrs.
Casey, who is president of the women’s
group of the Australian-American Asso-
ciation, has held a pilot’s licence since
1938 and pilots her own aircraft. Paint-
ing is another of her accomplishments,
and she is an excellent horse-rider. Later
in the year Mrs. Casey will go to England
as one of a panel of judges for an Inter-
national Sculpture Exhibition.
A lovely collection of spring clothes
was shown at a cocktail-party in the
Myer model salon for the Whernside
Auxiliary to the Royal Melbourne Hos-
pital. In opening the show Kenneth
Myer said it was the first collection of
all-Australian models his firm had shown,
and was to the credit to Sheila Scottar,
who had adapted the clothes, which had
a French flair, to the needs of Australian
women. President of the Whernside
Auxiliary, Mrs. J. J. Campbell, attended
the showing with her husband and
mother, Mrs. Rupert Downes. Mrs.
Ronald Marriott, who was ticket-secre-
tary, was attractive in black suit and
beetle-green feather hat. Mrs. Sidney
Baillieu Myer’s suit and hat were in
elephant’s-breath toning. Her daughter-
in-law, Mrs. Kenneth Myer, wore over
a black frock a three-quarter coat of grey
Persian-lamb. Mrs. Ross Shelmerdine
contrasted her black suit with a tangerine
straw hat. Mrs. Philip Dare combined
black jacket-suit, mink stole and tiny
black velvet beret. Madame Reshid Bey
wore a red-spotted black taffeta.
From the fashion house of Georges, in
Collins-street, comes exciting news for
spring and summer. “Fashion prefers
blondes” is the theme, with tonings on the
vegetable level; from pale parsnip to
onion-brown, with catrot-red, coral-red,
tomato and emerald ; black with white
will also be popular. With black, these
various shades will be used for accents,
Summerweight worsteds, alpaca, paper
shantung, embroidered linen, heavy
corded silks, deques and chiffons will be
used to make attractive ensembles for
the warm weather. The “wandering
waistline” is emphasised with cummer-
bunds and the long middy line in frocks;
necklines feature the cut-low and scooped-
out and the wide, cut-to-the-shoulders.
These necklines are often filled in with
gilets, jabots and scarves. There is the
charm of “separates.” One consists of a
citron-yellow organza blouse, the sleeves
cut very wide and worn with a black
alpaca skirt. Another teamed a coral-red
organza blouse with a black skirt. The
skirt of one black organza frock was
sunray-pleated, with the deep hem of
corded pleating, giving a bell-effect.
From Sydney
The Opera Ball, held on Saturday at the
A.C.I. ballroom, was a great success,
although there were very few guests in
costume. The decorations were excep-
tionally attractive—masked figures in
opera costume leaned over the balcony
and stood on the steps; swans, birds,
butterflies and clusters of pink flowers
created an atmosphere of gaiety and
grace. The president of the ball com-
mittee, Mrs. Tom Bateman, was Amelia
from “The Masked Rail” —her husband
was a very convincing Sacristan from
“Tosca.” Mrs. Charles Parsons as Lucia
won the prize for the best costume worn
by a woman, Dr. Fitzpatrick’s Barber
of Seville carried off the prize for the
men. Jann Rollason and Harry Kean as
Carmen and Don Jose were the best-
dressed couple. Mrs, Walter Simpson’s
Tosca was graceful. Operagoers in Sydney
have by this time come to know one an-
other so well that any function arranged
by them has the atmosphere of a private
party. It was this spirit of friendliness
that made the ball on Saturday night such
a success.
A most interesting musical recital was
given by 14-year-old Oleg Hmelnitsky at
the Mosman home of Mrs. Frank Cook
during the week. who is a student
of Scots College, plays the zcymbalon, an
instrument which dates bacL at least as
far as King David’s time and is men-
tioned in the Bible. Very rare in Aus-
tralia, the zcymbalon is made in Hun-
gary, where it is usually played with a
band. Dr. Kauzal, who spoke at the
recital, said that to play it accompanied
only by a piano, as Oleg did, required rare
musical skill. Oleg has been learning
only 14 months from his father, who was
formerly musical director for Pavlova.
Mrs. Bruce Eaton, who organised the
recital, said it is hoped to raise funds for
Oleg’s further musical education. Among
those who listened with enjoyment to
the music were Lady Hallstrom, Mrs.
J. W. M. Eaton, Mrs. Florence Taylor
and Mrs. E. Scorfield.
This is versatile June Wimble, who will
play a leading role in the Mercury
Theatre’s gala production of “The
Witch” on August 29. This premiere will
mark the opening of the Mercury
Theatre as Sydney’s new full-week
theatre. Since her recent return from
several years in Europe, June has starred
at the Mercury Theatre as Toinette in
“The Imaginary Invalid,” which she had
played earlier with Peter Finch, and in
“French Without Tears,” another box-
office success. June is the only child of
the G. B. Wimbles, of Darling Point,
and is Mrs. Douglas Pollard when away
from the theatre.
There were about 250 people at the
“Encore a Paris” party at the A.C.I.
ballroom on Friday night, but it was
generally considered that “everyone” was
there. Perhaps it was the presence of
Mr. Justice Maxwell that gave rise to
this impression. The main entertainment
was a parade of clothes (few but elegant)
by Caroline Chambrelent and hats by
Henriette Lamotte, who obviously con-
siders that the back of the head is no
place for a hat at the moment. Elizabeth
Northcott was there wearing a classical-
blue and white dress, Mrs. Laurence
Byrne in black lace, Mrs. Ernest Watt
in a cocktail dress of black velvet and
grosgrain (very fetching), her daughter
Mrs. Laurence Street in a lovely grey
organdie sprinkled with white organdie
flowers. Sue Playfair wore organdie also.
Madeleine Archbutt’s dress had a hobble
skirt slit to the knees. The clothes of
the guests were mannequin-parade stuff,
generally speaking. The party was
a combined effort by the committees of
the Black and White Ball and the
Naughty Nineties Ball.
A dance with a different flavor was
the birthday-party of the Independent
Theatre, held last Sunday night in the
main hall, where it seemed that practically
any member of the audience could have
leapt on to the stage and entertained the
audience had he or she been asked. As it
was there were some very fine items, in-
cluding Bobby Limb’s “Cecilia,” “Dear
Miss Dix” and “Abadabbadabba.” Doris
Litton (who can jive most expertly, by
the way) wore a cocktail dress of shot-
rose taffeta. Mrs. Walter Running, presi-
dent of the dance committee, was in
black. Mrs. Bunning really should get
a special mention for the work she has
done during the week at social functions.
For the Opera Ball she cooked enough
fish-raornay for 350 people (and a very
good fish-mornay it was), while on
Sunday she cut 500 rounds of sandwiches
for the party at night. On Thursday,
Friday and Saturday she appeared as
Julia in the Independent's production
“The Cocktail Party,” wherein she passes
some scathing remarks on the catering.
Well, she certainly should be able to
judge.
Mrs. R. G. Menzies delighted listeners
at the English-speaking Union meeting
on Thursday when she spoke of her recent
trip abroad with the Prime Minister.
She described her experiences with the
simple enthusiasm of one who doesn’t
know what it is to be bored and who
finds pleasure in every new experience.
Her amusing little stories of the P.M.
sitting up all night in the plane because
he said there wasn’t enough room for him
to undress, of Margaret Truman being
disappointed because renovations to the
White House prevented her playing her
trick of lowering and raising the three
huge chandeliers by merely pressing a
button, of Mr. Churchill’s preference for
champagne and his amazement that any-
one else would dislike it, gave her account
of the trip intimacy and charm. There
was a record attendance at the meeting,
for which the hostesses were Mrs. H. J.
Brady and Mrs. J. R. Miller.
The J. D. K. Roches, of Edgecliff, in
their trek round the world have now
reached South America —the Argentine,
to be precise—where they are the guests
of Mr. and Mrs. Julio Menditequy. Julio
is a famous polo-player whom they met
when they were staying with the Duke
and Duchess of Sutherland. A few weeks
more in South America, then the Roches
go to South Africa for a month, then
back to Sydney via Singapore.
The pageant at the Royal Empire Ball
on September 3 promises to be extra-
special this year. Arranged by Colonel
O’Sullivan, it features the queens of
England from Elizabeth I to Elizabeth
11, as well as a Commonwealth group
posed around an illuminated globe and
heralded by trumpeters and drummers.
Anne Lovett is the first Elizabeth, Miss
V. B. Webb, Queen Anne. Mary II is
Elaine Cook and Mrs. Allan Williams
will be Queen Victoria. Queen Elizabeth
II will be represented by a large portrait
to be unveiled by pages. Tickets both
for the gallery and for the ball itself are
very much in demand.
For her wedding to Noel Tanner,
Elaine Davis, of Coogee, wore a dress
of French mignon lace over satin with
a three-tiered fingertip tulle veil held in
place by a pillbox hat of lace and satin.
The bridesmaid, Yvonne Davis, matron-
of-honor Mrs. H. Biner and flower-girl
Joy Davis wore full-skirted yellow self-
flowered organza dresses with matching
hats beaded and pearl-sewn. Elaine is
the eldest daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
L. M. Davis, of Coogee. Her husband is
the youngest son of Mr, and Mrs. R.
Tanner, of Bondi. The wedding took
place at the Temple Emanuel, Woollahra.
The tours to Canberra and Orange be-
ing arranged by, the Garden Club seem
very moderate in cost. For a three-day
trip to Canberra during blossom-time
(September) the charge of £8 10s. includes
bus fare, accommodation and sightseeing.
There is to be a similar tour in November
for the spring flowers. The Orange tour
starts on October 10, so that it will be
possible to see the Cherry Festival and
the crowning of the queen. This is a
four-day tour and the cost is £ll 10s.
Replicas of the British Crown jewels
will form one of the special display sets
at the International Exhibition which
begins in the Y.W.C.A. building on
September 3 and continues for 10 days.
The exhibition is designed to foster
friendship between national groups and
to help New Australians to find their feet
here. Evening entertainment will be dif-
ferent every night, and will include folk-
dancing and singing, classical dancing,
orchestras, conjuring and tableaux.
Artists are coming from South Australia
and Cooma (N.S.W.). Costumes are
being sought from as far away as west
Australia.

G. E. Barwick, Q.C., had the Bank
Grab case in his satchel in 194*8, as well
as the wheatgrowers’ in their claim on
the Federal Government. An Old
Fortian who won a Sydney University
medal in law in 1925, he has been
steadily climbing ever since. Now one
of the handful of counsel for whom there
is always a rush whenever big issues are
involved, he was elected president of the
Law Council of Australia the other day.
A keen skier, he’ll take a brief for the
attractions of the snow country on the
slightest provocation.
Professor Clyde Kluckhohn, who is
billed fgr an Australia-wide series of
lectures under the terms of the bequesfi
of the late E. C. Dyason, the Melbourne
stockbroker, thinks that the cure of the
world’s ills could lie in anthropology. Il
has been found in the past, he says, that
the understanding of neighbors is of
vital importance, and if war is to be
avoided we must understand the nature
of the Russians. When he was in his
first year at Princeton he was taken ill
and went to New Mexico to recover,
became interested in the language and
customs of the Navaho Indians, got lost
in wild country in Utah and was rescued
by a Navaho rescue-party. His first book.
To the Foot of the Rainbow, was a
description of his packhorse wanderings
on this occasion—he has written a lot of
others. Of mixed English, Scottish and
German descent, he was born in Le
Mars, lowa, in 1905, went to Oxford as
a Rhodes Scholar, and is now Professor
of Anthropology and Director of the
Russian Research Centre at Harvard,
where 80 workers are hard at
researching into Russian politics,
psychology, sociology and economics, at
a cost to the Carnegie Corporation of
150,000 dollars yearly. The professor is
married to a sociologist, was at one-time
backstroke swimming star of Princeton,
and owns a 160-acre ranch in New
Mexico.
_ In Tom McMahon the Reaper claimed
i he Bulletin’s oldest identity in Sydney
the other day. For long the paper’s sec-
retary and accountant, Tom had been
with it for 48 years, joining in 1880, one
week after it was born. Born himself in
the rear of his father’s farrier’s shop in
George-street, Tom’s job in The
Bulletin in those early days ranged
from keeping the books and sweeping
floors to looking for ads and turning the
fly-wheel of the printing-machine when
its engine broke down. When a couple
of Bulletin scribes called to wish him
a happy 90th birthday he could still recall
the giants of the past. Signer of count-
less “Thank Heaven, That’s Paid”
cheques, Tom also gave almost as many
unofficial handouts from his pocket to
hard-up contributors. He was 92 at the
end.
“A.U.”: After training Malaya-bound
Lincoln-bomber crews at Amberley (Q.)
for 17 months, Wing-Commander Noel
Quinn is himself to do a bandit-bombing
tour in command of the R.A.A.F.’s No. 1
Squadron in Malaya, based at Tengah
airfield, near the Bukit Timah-road that
Singapore Diggers know so much about.
Slightly-built, sprightly and decisive,
Quinn joined up on September 3, 1939.
By the time he qualified as a Hudson
pilot the Japs were well on their way
through the Indies. With other hard-
flying Hudson crews, Quinn fought losing
air-battles from bases on Ambon and
Timor, and later met the Japs again on
the New Guinea side, when he went north
with No. 6 (Hudson) Squadron, after that
taking the war into Jap shipping-lanes as
commander of No. 8 (Beaufort torpedo-
bomber) Squadron. In December,' 1943,
Quinn led a torpedo low-level strike
against Jap shipping in Rabaul —he still
does not know what hit his plane, except
that it was made in Japan. Captured in
Rabaul, he was rolling cigarettes from
Jap doormats in a mainland p.-0.-w. camp
when finally freed in 1945. In Malaya he
will be under the wing of another Aus-
tralian Air-Vice-Marshal Scherger,
Malaya’s new air-boss.
The somewhat pugnacious expression

worker, Sir Walter comes of a great pas-
toral family, has been president of the
Royal Agricultural Society of S.A. since
1932 and a director of Goldsbrough
Mort for a v mort of years. As well, he
has done much to place his State on the
industrial map, directorships on B.H.P.
and Australian Iron and Steel assisting
in that regard. President of the council
for the past eight years, he’s the son of a
former M.L.C.
“Smilo” farewells an institution:
The closing-down a week or so ago of the
“Albury Banner” printing-works was the final
phase in the activities of what was for many
years the largest provincial newspaper in Aus-
tralia. The journal itself ceased publication
two years ago, after circulating widely in the
Riverina and north-eastern Victoria for over
90 years. Founded .by George Arthur Adams
on July 4, 1860, the “Banner’s” first leader
styled itself in the journalese of the time a
“chart to direct the traveller and the settler
to a safe and pleasant harborage, and to divert
them from the shoals and quicksands of
degradation.” A promise was also made to
“spare neither pains nor expense to obtain the
latest intelligence and to avail ourselves largely
of the aid of the electric-wire.” Within a few
years the four-page broadsheet of 1860 had
grown to a 48-page weekly. George Sunder-
land Adams (son of the founder) and Foster
Cooper later joined the firm, which then became
know as Adams, Cooper and Adams. For 49
years Foster Cooper’s editorial pen worked in
the interests of his paper and the Murray Valley
districts —and perplexed compositors who set his
copy into type. I recall as a boy running copy
and proofs to and from the home of this
dignified bearded figure, and my delight in the
reward of an apple or slice of cake from his
daughter Caroline. Next editor was George A.
Gray, who for some years as “Uncle Jeff” had
conducted the two weekly pages for children.
A much-loved identity of the paper was
Thomas Smiles, who, as “Atlas,” edited the
sporting-pages for almost 20 years. Coming to
the “Banner” first as a compositor, he was
over 40 years with the firm. Among contri-
butors none was more eagerly read than Harry
Turnbull (“The Little Rascal”), who turned
out delightful verse and comment for many
years. For the last 10 years of its life the
“Banner” was controlled by the Elliot group.
L. J. Clarke, new head of the P.M.G.’s
telegraph branch in Westralia, started as
messenger. Born in the State, he took his
specialised knowledge into a sigs unit just
before Australia mobilised, and prac-
tised it in New Guinea, coming
home major. After the war he held
down a senior post in the Munitions
Department, at the same time completing
the B.A. (Economics) Degree which the
war had interrupted. A neatly-built 50,
he’s had 36 years in the P.M.G. outfit.
Adelaide’s business centre lost one of
its best-known arid most genial prac-
titioners when Sir James Hay Gosse
passed on the other day. Born at Kent
Town (S.A.) 75 years ago (his father was
one-time Deputy Surveyor-General of the
State), Sir James laid the physical founda-
tions of his business alertness through
representing his State at football and
rowing. Consul for Denmark for years,
he had a directorial interest in a long list
of concerns, their ramifications ranging
from steamships and cement to banks and
collieries. He added the chairmanship
of directors of the Bank of Adelaide to
the list in June last year. Created Knight
of Dannebrog in 1934, he received the
British accolade in 1947.
From “Wingella,” Darwin, N.T.:
A colorful character died in Darwin hospital
the other day. He was Maiauggala, a lead-
ing citizen of Amheim Land. He spent several
years in Darwin as a police-tracker, but pre-
ferred his own class and community. A leader
in all corroborees, and strongly attached to
tribal ceremonials, he resisted all efforts to
convert him to Christianity.
Plans are in hand to build a Greek church
in Darwin and to appoint a priest, such as the
Greeks knew in pre-war days. Archbishop
Theophylactos, head of the Greek Orthodox
Church in Australia and New Zealand, is at
present visiting Darwin.
An early-morning visitor to Darwin hospital
the other day was a 3ft. 6in. crocodile. He was
interviewed by one of the doctors, but was
not admitted.
“D.E.H.”: My brother, Surgeon-
Lieutenant C. F. Harrington, was lost
when H.M.A.S. Parramatta was sunk
north of Tobruk in 1941 ; not in her sister-
ship Yarra, as mentioned in B. 6/8/’52.
Good morning, Sir Edward. Would
you tell us something of that Appleton
layer of yours up in the ionosphere before
you address the U.R.S.I. conference?:
Oh, that —by the way, it’s almost warm
enough here for cricket, y’know. Cricket’s
the game, m’lad! Only thing I don’t like
about it is that I can’t watch it all day. My
biggest disappointment is that I won’t be
able to sit on the hill and listen to those
priceless comments. Eh? Oh, yes—York-
shireman, born in Bradford. Well, my
layer is 150 miles up, 90 above the Heaviside
layer—by Jove, you should have seen Vie
Trumper in action! And that other feller —
you should know, they called him the
“Governor-General” Charlie Macartney.
Did you know that he and Bradman each
made a century before lunch in Test cricket?
Eh? Oh, it makes short-wave communica-
tion possible by reflecting the radio-waves
downwards. Speaking of Bradman —I could
see him in Adelaide; but that won’t be
much good—he won’t be playing. Damned
pity. Eh? What’s the layer composed of?
EDWARD APPLETON.
Oh, all right—l must say you’re damned
persistent. It’s made up of freely-roving
electrons which are chipped off the atoms
of oxygen and hydrogen by sunlight—ultra-
violet light from the sun. Will that do?
Yes, chipped-off is the term. Talking of
chipping—next to cricket, golf
Short, rotund, genial and frosty-pated,
Sir Edward Appleton, one of Britain’s
most distinguished scientists, principal of
Edinburgh University and cricket
enthusiast, marched off to deliver his
opening speech at Sydney University as
president of the international radio-
science assembly.
Landed in Australia, Dr. Silvio Daneo,
newly-appointed Minister for Italy.
An artilleryman of War I, he has been
in Italy’s diplomatic service since 1927,
and comes here after four years in Phila-
delphia (U.S.A.). Italy, he says, is keenly
interested in Australian wool, and pre-
pared to exchange textiles and jnachinery,
among other products, for it.
“P.0.M.C.”: Many on this eastern side
will be delighted if astonished to learn
that P. C. Anderson, of Swanbourne
(W.A.), still smites golf-balls with force
and accuracy (B. 30/7/’52). I knew him
intimately 40 years ago, when I twice
received “the cuts” from his own limbered
swing, a rare distinction for a lower-
former. On the first occasion, after
vainly searching every nook and cranny
of the holy of holies for his outsize cane,
he delivered the “sixer” with a strap,
presenting me with the difficulty of pre-
tending that the strokes hurt. In a sense,
P.C. combined the pulpit with the school-
room ; he personally conducted morning
prayers daily before the assembled school
and always took the Scripture period in
each class himself. However, a little
judicious prompting by pupils at the
outset soon sidetracked these latter
sessions into amiable talks about almost
anything but religion. A truly lovable
man ; his long career at Scotch must have
endeared him in the memories of thou-
sands of ex-scholars.
At the time of his death in Sydney Sir
William Dixson was the outstanding col-
lector of Australiana, the greatest in Aus-
tralian history except for David Scott
Mitchell —his collection of books alone is
estimated by an expert to be worth well
over £lOO,OOO. Born in Sydney and
schooled at All Saints’ College, Bathurst,
William went off to Scotland at 19,
had 10 years of engineering there and
returned home to join the family tobacco
firm. His business acumen, which gained
him a directorship of that concern, as well
as of the British-Australasian Tobacco
Co., proved a great asset in amassing his
accumulation of books and pictorial
records. Most of these will go to N.S.W.
Public Library. A large part of his
historical picture collection is already in
the Dixson Gallery there. He was his own
librarian. Though frequently urged to
employ one it was his pleasure to do his
own collations, and he was never happier
than when dissecting a newly-found
treasure with the help of some expert
friend. He was among the seniors of the
15 Fellows of the Royal Australian
Historical Society, and a benefactor of it.
Many a young historian had cause to
thank him for a helping hand, for his
collection was always at the disposal of
scholars. Knighted in 1939, he was 82 at
the end.
Into the Silence:
In the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital, at
45, Brigadier A. G. Torr, C.8.E., D. 5.0.,
commander of the 2/1 Field Company, R.A.
Engineers, 6th Division, in the late war, one
of the youngest majors, and one of the first
Australians to gain D. 5.0., in the 2nd A.I.F. He
served in Libya, Greece and Crete, was later
chief-engineer of the Australian force in New
Guinea, and was in charge of the engineering
work in several important New Guinea, New
Britain and Bougainville campaigns.
In Fremantle, at 84, William John Doherty,
one-time heavyweight boxing-champion of Aus-
tralia and contender for the world title. Born
in Victoria, he walloped every middleweight who
shaped up to him. He had his first big fight with
Tom Duggan, and fought up to the Australian
championship. He met Kid McCoy at
Johannesburg for the world title, but was beaten,
and lost the Australian title to Billy McColl in
Sydney. A survivor of the old moustached, Jem
Mace school, Doherty had a marvellous memory
of the old-time fights and fighters, which was
reinforced by a large collection of newspaper
clippings. These supplied him with material
for his one venture into authorship; In the Days
of the Giants, published in England, was a
mine of information about the ring in the
latter half of the past century. After putting
his gloves away Doherty became a patrolman
on the Fremantle wharves.
Near Gosford (N.S.W.), at 73, David John
Mares. Son of American parents, he was born
in Sydney, schooled at Fort-street and St.
Andrew’s College, and gained top score in
meteorology in the P.S. exams, of 1910. He
was appointed N-S.W. Meteorologist seven years
later. When the meteorological service of Aus-
tralia was transferred to the R.A.A.F. for the
duration, Mares was gazetted wing-commander.
Earlier, his forecasting had been of particular
value in the pioneer days of Tasman Sea flying.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Air-curing Lucerne.
“Agric”: The growing of
lucerne in Queensland coastal
areas may be revolutionised by
air-curing methods adopted by
Damien Kennedy, Monte Casino,
Kilcoy (Q.). Kennedy began to
experiment with artificial curing
after severe reverses in field-
curing during the 1950 flood
season.
Barn hay-drying is practised
extensively in Britain and
America. With plant obtained
secondhand, and assembled by
local resources, Kennedy is now
marketing a green, leafy lucerne,
straight out of the windrow. He
is using a lOh.p. diesel engine,
which drives a countershaft,
from which is driven a 42in. fan
running at 600 revs, per minute.
The engine is big for the job, but
it is used also for irrigation-
pumping. A 6h.p. engine would
be arpple, he says, and it could
be fitted up within a few feet of
the fan with short belting.
Through the centre of the hay-
shed is a pit about 3ft. deep and
4ft. wide, through which air is
forced from the fan. The pit is
straddled crosswise by substantial
logs capable of holding up
several tons of lucerne. The
lucerne is loaded into the shed
by a steel fork-grab worked by
a tractor on a wire-rope system.
It takes off about half a ton at
a grab. The hay is run over the
pit to any required position and
dumped off, where two men
spread ft over the logs.
Sufficient hay for 200 bags of
chaff can be handled at a time.
The fan, steel grab and pulley
system cost less than £lOO, while
the pit construction requires only
a pick and shovel, or scoop.
The chief advantage of air-cured
hay, says Kennedy, is the higher
protein food-value, estimated at
20 per cent, better than the best
field-cured hay; in some cases
it would be 50 per cent, higher.
No leaf need be lost with air-
curing. Kennedy believes that,
taking all costs into considera-
tion, he can cure lucerne by his
method more cheaply than in the
field, although this seems to be
at variance with American
opinion.
American Herefords.
“Oxo”: R. S. Wilson, of
Calliope Hereford stud, Glad-
stone (Q.), back from U.S.A.,
says American horned Herefords
are so different in type from the
Herefords in Australia that he
declined the offer of a bull
though he had been hoping to
buy one.
On the other hand, he found
that Poll Herefords had improved
out of recognition since he was
in America 15 years ago. The
horned Herefords had wonderful
heads, a lot of thickness and
also a lot of fleshing—all wanted
in Australia —but American
breeders took no notice of color
and markings. The lighter the
color the better breeders seemed
to like them ; they paid no heed
to black noses or tails. Practi-
cally all the horned cattle he saw
had a “tie” in the back.
Cotton.
“C.S.”: In 1949 the Tariff
Board found the local cotton
industry in a state of collapse,
despite 30 years of Government
support, and said that support
should cease.
On the other hand, the Aus-
tralian Agricultural Council has
set a “target” for 1958 of
60,000 acres of cotton for a
yield of 10 to 15 million pounds.
The August “Review” of the
Bank of New South Wales says
the major problems of cotton-
growing in Australia are how
to obtain better yields per acre
and how to overcome the
scarcity and high cost of labor.
Almost all the Australian crop
is grown in south-east Queens-
land, where it is mainly an
adjunct to dairying.
Yields in Australia have not
improved since the 1920’5,
whereas in the U.S.A. there has
been a steadily-increasing yield,
and today the U.S. farmer gets
three to five times as much as
we do per acre. Limitation of
growing to irrigation areas and
better rotation systems could
bring improvement, and
mechanical picking reduce costs.
If the 60,000-acre target can be
reached we could save some £3
million annually in cotton
imports.
Bees For Hire.
“S.”: Following the droughts
and bushfires of last summer
fruit- and vegetable-growers
have begun to miss bees from
their orchards and gardens. Ex-
tensive burning-out of blossom-
ing trees and heaths sent travel-
ling apiarists far in search of
new blossom country, millions
of wild bees were destroyed in
the fires, more have been de-
stroyed (many deliberately) by
poison sprays, and far too many
orchardists and gardeners are
indifferent or openly hostile to
bees.
Now I’m told that in the big
Shepparton fruit-belt of Vic-
toria the executive of the local
growers’ organisation says fruit-
growers “are not interested in
encouraging apiarists unless it
can be absolutely guaranteed
the bees will pollinate the trees.”
This is astonishing, putting it
mildly, and displays incredible
ignorance. In U.S.A. the result
of bee-labor on the trees is so
evident that the basis of profit
to both bee-herder and grower
is worked out on the returns
over and above the yearly aver-
age of the land. Lucerne-seed
men are finding it needs four
times the number of sacks
necessary to hold the yield when
bees are present. At flowering-
time all over the U.S.A.
thousands of miniature colonies
of bees, known as “package-
bees,” are installed up and down
the rows of trees, on the head-
lands of seed crops, on vast
fields of the various melon
crops.
However, there is some
awakening here. At Rutherglen
(Vic.) a “Pollen Experimental
Apiary” has been set up.
Records are being made of the
effect on near-by crops. Ten
hives set in a pumpkin paddock
resulted in a 95 per cent, setting
of fruit; in a similar crop a
mile away without hives only a
fraction over half the crop set.
As growers slowly learn the
value of the honey-bee they will
find that a “Bureau of Pollina-
tion” —in Victoria, at least —
awaits them. A phone-call to
the bureau will result in 10
hives, or 20, or 100 being placed
along their boundaries. Once
established the idea will spread
as rapidly as any other plan
which brings great benefit to
those who use it, and for both
beeman and farmer the sooner
the better.
Cattle and Railways.
“Ox-tail”; Cattle equal in
value to the cost of building
vital railways from the Dajarra
railhead in Queensland to New-
castle Waters in the Northern
Territory and the Charleville-
Blackall link have been lost in
the northern drought, according
to the president of the United
Graziers’ Association (W- A.
Gunn).
Gunn estimates the loss at H
million cattle valued at £25 mil-
lion, and says most of these
would have been saved if there
had been a Dajarra-Newcastle
Waters link. He said that by
the end of August there would
be few fat cattle left in Queens-
land and by Christmas a major
beef shortage was likely. The
drought would be felt most
severely in 1956 and 1957 be-
cause of the loss of breeders and
calves.
There seems to be a moral in
this, and, as far as I can work
it out, it is that affected cattle
interests should form a com-
pany, raise capital, obtain a
franchise from the Queensland
and Canberra Governments and
build the railway themselves.
On Gunn’s figures they could
expect to save £25 million in the
first drought following the build-
ing of the railway—a very good
return on capital outlay.
Pyrethrum Prospects.
“F.G.N.”: Attempts to grow
pyrethrum on a commercial
scale in Australia over the past
20 years have failed primarily
because production costs are 100
high. The C.5.1.R.0. sees no
reason for believing that further
attempts could succeed at
present.
In 1931 the C.5.1.R.0. im-
ported seed of Pyrethrum cine-
rarifolium and grew it at Can-
berra, The best strain was
“He keeps thinkin' he's Little Boy Blue."
selected and seed-stocks accumu-
lated. Seed was made available
to 170 farmers in N.S.W. and
Victoria. The Domino Chemical
Co., of Canterbury (N.S.W.),
processed about one ton of
locally-produced flowers in the
first few seasons. In 1938 the
company stated: “Our efforts to
establish the industry of pyre-
thrum-flower production have
failed.” Other commercial in-
terests admitted failure.
Since Japan was the main
supplier, by May, 1942, pyre-
thrum was short and the Army
asked that local production be
tried even if only on an emer-
gency basis. Plantations were
started in p.-0.-w. camps and
under C.5.1.R.0. supervision, v
A total of 26i tons of dried
pyrethrum flowers was produced
with an average yield of 3241 b.
of flowers per acre in the first
season and 5631 b. per acre in
the second season.
Content of active principle
(pyrethrin) of the flowers was
disappointingly low.
During the third season
D.D.T. became available, and
increased supplies of pyrethrum
came from Kenya. The need to
struggle further with local pro-
duction ceased and the planta-
tions were abandoned. The
C.5.1.R.0. continued its experi-
mental plots, but it has no record
of any subsequent commercial
production of pyrethrum in
Australia. Imports of pyrethrum
flowers during 1951-52 approxi-
mated 2123 cwt.
The most optimistic expecta-
tion, says the C.5.1.R.0., is that
growers in Australia might aver-
age 6001 b. of flowers per acre
annually over a five-year period.
Average life of a plantation
would not be longer than five
years. If the material produced
were of 1.3 p.c. pyrethrin con-
tent the gross annual return per
acre would be just under £lOO.
Prospects of producing
material with such a high con-
tent are very slight. At the best
a content of 1 p.c. might be
realised, and it is doubtful if
material of this quality would
be saleable.
Home-grown Tomatoes.
“C.H.”: In N.S.W. the best
time to plant is September.
When transplanting from the
seedling-box lift out each plant
with its full share of soil. Use
a short-handled hoe, drive it
into the soil and pull it back-
wards without releasing it.
Now, behind the hoe, set the
tomato plant to the depth of the
first two leaves, hold it down
firmly and, as the hoe is released,
gather the soil around it, press
closely around the root and stem
and level off the earth with the
fingers.
Tomatoes set in this way are
never affected by high winds,
which kill them off when they
are planted at shallow depth or
just dropped in, A 14in. spacing
is satisfactory.
For single-stem plants place
stakes in position immediately
after planting. This forestalls
damage to the root-system later.
Make the stakes sft. long and
lin. thick and drive them in to
a depth of lsin.
Cultivation of tomatoes should
be shallow ; keep down weeds
and maintain a soil mulch which
will conserve moisture. Shoots
starting at the junction of leaf
and stem should be pinched out.
Early spraying with Bordeaux
mixture 3:4:50 will ward off
attacks of blight.
Storing Apples.
“Jonathan”: Experiments in
the gas-storage of Granny Smith
apples indicate an early end to
seasonal famines. Under normal
storage conditions Granny
Smiths have to be taken out of
cold-store in August or Sep-
tember, but under gas can be
kept until December. This
means that apples could be
available at a time of shortage
and high prices.
An official of the C.5.1.R.0.
claimed that gas-storage had
extended the life of Jonathan
apples by as much as 50 per cent.
Life of Granny Smiths could be
THE WEATHER.
By Inigo Jones.
It is possible that a rather pronounced southern sunspot
group on the move may cause further disturbed
conditions unless it fades badly, which is possible. If, how-
ever, it livens up it will act more quickly and with greater
intensity.
Relief for the northern pastoral areas still holds off,
but relief is shown on both cycles and should come,
probably with one of these sunspot outbreaks. The records
are not yet sufficient to check this, but it should come with
a sunspot outbreak if it is a component of the present cycle.

Elements of an Industry ... No. 7of a SerieO
J
IRON The element Iron is the most important of all
metals and, -next to aluminium, the most widely distributed. It
has been estimated that there is an average of 1 cwt. of iron for
every ton of the earth’s crust. There are many different forms of
iron ore but only four haematite, magnetite, limonite, and
siderite are of industrial value. Most of the iron ore mined in
Australia comes from the haematite deposits at Iron Knob in
South Australia, and Yampi in Western Australia. The ore is
smelted in a blast furnace with coal and limestone, becoming
pig-iron, the raw material from which cast iron, wrought iron,
and steel are made. Steel, the strongest metal in common use, is
iron containing about 0.15 per cent carbon and small amounts
of other elements.
Although copper and bronze have been used in the world much
longer than iron, history shows that over three thousand years
ago it was used to make implements and weapons. Today, it is
an essential in the structure of civilisation. Without it there
would be no railways, steamships, skyscrapers or machinery as
we know them. Apart from its use in the construction of plants
and factories, iron, and some of its compounds are vital to
certain chemical processes.
At Deer Park, ICIANZ uses iron as a catalyst for the production
of synthetic ammonia, whilst some of its compounds are used in
other factories in the manufacture of chemicals. At the same
time, ICIANZ also supplies a number of chemical products
which are essential to the production of iron and steel in their
various forms.

prolonged by as much as 30 per
cent., though they have a
tendency to superficial scald.
Chicken-brooding.
“Rooster”: For the coming
breeding-season clean and dis-
infect the incubators, brooders,
drinking-troughs, food-hoppers,
etc., and thus reduce disease
risk. Ample room should be
provided in the brooder-house
and under the hovers. Over-
crowding can cause deaths and
injury, and allows the introduc-
tion of coccidiosis and other
diseases.
Chickens rear better on wire-
floors. These allow air to
circulate under the chicks at
night while they are confined to
the brooder and eliminate sweat-
ing. Wire-floors keep the chicks
clear of droppings and prevent
damp-spots.
Thousands of chicks die each
year through insufficient atten-
tion, resulting in chilling and
overheating.
Chickens need a clean, warm,
healthy environment, particu-
larly during the first weeks.
Watch closely the growth, food-
consumption and general
activity each day.
Pig-raising.
“Mr.”: Food can be saved by
arranging for sows to farrow at
periods of skim-milk production.
The right times are about two
months prior to the cows calving
and again six months later.
The first (autumn) litters will
be weaned and able to cope with
the increasing supplies of skim-
milk as they grow to heavy
baconers in November. The
second litters born in October-
November won’t have as much
skim-milk as their predecessors,
and consequently will need to be
pushed along by increasing their
supplementary feeds.
This pig-crop is best marketed
as light baconers and porkers
before the sows farrow again in
the autumn.
Kikuyu.
' Kikuyu has its
faults. The late E. J. Breakwell,
who introduced it into this
country from Africa, said he
could never decide whether he
had done Australia a good turn
or not. When conditions suit it
kikuyu will take full charge of
any holding.
Never plant it near buildings
or homesteads. Its roots go
down 12-14 feet after moisture
and wreck foundations. It will
choke up creeks and overthrow
fences. But its nutrition-values
are high.
“L.H.8.G.”: I have found
that a strip of buffalo-grass, say
2ft, wide, will stop the spread
of kikuyu in any direction.
Buffalo-grass is not hard to
control and stands up to winds.
Hints for the Farm.
“Sundowner”; For Victorian
apple - and pear - orchards,
plough-in green manure in
August to rid the soil of black--
spot fungus.
“C.A.A.”: Because potatoes
develop a green color under
light and can then cause stomach
disorders, store them only in a
dark place.
“Konanda”: When handling
bees, wear a shirt with elastic
at the wrists to prevent the bees
crawling up the sleeves. Wear a
fine cloth shirt over a pullover
in cold weather, as bees object
strongly to rough surfaces.
“Mur”; Spare woollens keep
perfectly and suffer no moth
damage if they are washed and
dried and immediately placed in
a freshly-washed meat-bag. Tie
the bag with string. If it is pos-
sible to buy paradichlorbenzine
a few crystals will kill any insect
pests left in the bag.
“Quorn”; When tethering a
grazing animal wrap the line or
chain round the peg a number
of times to shorten the tether.
The animal will then feed closer
to the peg, and when the line is
unwound later the new feed will
not have been trampled over or
spoilt,
“Big Billy”: Naphthalene
dust, applied frequently, is a
useful repellent for carrot-rust
!jy- °n commercial areas apply
3001 b. to 4001 b. per acre; in
home gardens Ijroz. to 2oz. every
foot Of row. Dust after the first
thinning of the crop and repeat
fortnightly throughout the
season.
“Myrr”; If the growth of
leaf-crops, beetroot or tomatoes
slackens before maturity, work
in an ounce per square yard of
sulphate of ammonia or blood-
and-bone. With silver-beet,
Chinese cabbage and other
vegetables which produce over
an extended period, £oz. of
sulphate of ammonia or its
equivalent per plant every month
will keep them growing vigor-
ously. A rapid-growing plant
like lettuce will benefit from
lighter, more frequent applica-
tions, but keep the fertiliser
away from the leaves and stems.
“Spes”: In our N.S.W. central
coast district nearly 60 per cent,
of the dairymen are rearing
Hereford calves, and some are
using beef bulls on dairy cows
to produce quick-growing vealers
that are now real money. Selling
heifers as well, they aim to buy-
in heifers for the dairy herd.
There’s cash profit, but the
system is all wrong because
many heifers from topnotch
milkers are being lost.

Goodyear Tyres
m
It’s a big sprawling place, this Australia
. . . and our roads are —well, what they
are! That’s why so many Australians
prefer to travel on Goodyear tyres.
Goodyears give real comfort wherever
the going is good, and husky help when
it couldn’t be worsen In fact, many a
man has cause to thank the wider,
flatter, road-hugging tread and stronger
Goodyear shoulders. Why not get more
miles per tyre and more safety per mile
by travelling on Goodyear tyres?
THIS HAPPENS...
On this type of bridge
you find loose boards and
projecting bolts. Strongly
built Goodyear tyres
prove their worth, as
their tough resilience
minimises the bumps and
gives safe riding comfort.

The Seedlings Hold a Stop-
Growth Meeting.

ing around at the various seed-

lings in their backyard beds.
“We’re here to discuss our griev-
ances —and we have plenty—
and possible ways to get redress.
“As you know, we’re on the
job, selflessly, for 24 hours a
day, and he’d have us doing
overtime if he could find a way
to buck Greenwich and the
calendar. Bed and board is all
we get —if you can call it board,
the old skinflint. And even the
beds are lumpy—‘they haven’t
been turned for weeks. I’ll bet
he’d go crook if his wife treated
him like that. And I don’t know
about the rest of you, but I
haven’t had a decent feed of
blood-and-bone since I’ve been
here. It’s a poorhouse.
“My old man —Drumhead was
his. name —told me he was very
well fed. But, mind you, he was
pretty shrewd ; in fact he was
one of those hard-heads. His
grandfather used to make his
mouth water by telling him of
the beautiful tucker he used to
get —but that, of course, was
back in the days when they didn’t
have so many motor-cars. Why,
he even used to get second-help-
ings of liquid manure! But the
bloke who’s taken over this
garden now doesn’t know any-
thing about the game. If we
could only tell the nmg of a
good balanced diet for us! He
thinks you can take all the good-
ness out of the soil and never
need to put any back. And,
of course, we can’t stand too
much of that”
“Hear, hear!” interrupted the
young imperial black-seeded
lettuce aggressively. “He must
think we’re green! We’re not
going to stand any more, though.
I’ve developed a crook heart and
all because the cow’s too lousy
to sprinkle a bit of air-slaked
lime around to stonker the slugs
and snails that have a bit of me
every night. Why, he’s even
more frugal than police-
sergeants, and some o’ them,
I’ve heard, can make a deener
go farther than anyone else can
make a quid go.”
“And talking also of pheno-
menal luck,” said Nugget, a
young cauliflower. “I’d have
been sawn in halves early this
morning if a peewee hadn’t
snapped up a cutworm that was
making its way threateningly to-
wards me. Fancy a gardener
sinking so low r that he comes at
depending on the charitable act
of a passing bird to save his
seedlings from cold-blooded
murder! All he had to do was
to put some bran poison-baits
around —but oh, no, not him.
We’re only the things that work
for him.”
“Ar, his garden’s full of pests,”
said a small, battered-looking
spinach gloomily. “Especially
his kids. They will rush straight
across my bed, I suspect with
foul intent. They don’t like me,
not even with butter. I’d have
been dead long ago, what with
the mayhem they’ve committed
on me, only for my iron con-
stitution. They reckon my
ferric content rates higher than
the stuff from Iron Knob that
they feed into the B.H.P. blast-
furnaces. I used to wonder, be-
fore I woke up about all the
iron in me, why I used to go so
rusty-looking after we’d had a
lot of rain.”
“I’ll admit I’m a bit of a hog
on scran, and a heavy drinker,”
said the rhubarb. “But I can’t
get used to going to bed hungry
and thirsty every night. Me
stalks are just skin and fibre.”
“Just take a screw at me, will
you?” piped up a young odor-
less onion. “I should be start-
ing to get a corporation on me
like a poisoned pup the time
I’ve been in the ground. As it
is, all I’ve got’s a screwy-looking
swelling no bigger than a mump.
The ground I’m parked in is as
hard as the hobs of hell. And
no wonder. The goat slings all
his grass-clippings, vegetable-
peelings, old flowers and weeds
over the back fence on to that
vacant allotment, and here are
we doing a perish for the want
of a bit of compost. Ah, for
the sight of a few millions of
those juicy white wogs that crawl
around under a six-weeks-old
cabbage-leaf! I suppose our liv-
ing on other old vegetation
makes a cove a cannibal —Drum-
head’s relations have, in the past,
supplied some of my family with
its choicest viands, and we’re
grateful.’ Still, I suppose we
can’t help it if we’re built like
that. No doubt members of my
own family have also sacrificed
themselves nobly in the same
cause. Excuse me for howling,
but I’m a sentimental cuss,”
“Aw, you’re not so badly off
as us greens,” said the imperial
lettuce. “We’re half-starved, the
same as you blokes, but this
Alec must have read somewhere
that a few strong shots of sul-
phate of ammonia when a lettuce
is coming into heart gives us
such a boost that we’ll mature
quickly. It makes even the best-
tempered lettuce bitter when he’s
forced to grow slowly. Not be-
ing used to rich foods —you

phate ; it’s too rich, How T
would his stomach like it if he
was made to put away a big feed
of caviare and champagne
straight after doing a starve in
a desert? He’d break out in
carbuncles.”
“Pity he didn’t, anyway, the
way he treats us,” said the cab-
bage “Anyway, I’m putting this
motion to the meeting: ‘That
we form ourselves into an under-
ground resistance movement.
That we restrict our root-systems

treat us —or our successors, if
we are compelled to make the
supreme sacrifice —better. All

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Outback Transport
I see repeated over and over again that
some relief from rates and taxes would
attract people to and hold them on the
land. Although we live in an area where
bad weather renders our only means of
entrance and exit to the property impas-
sable to any type of vehicle, and although
the shire has this year raised all rates as
high as it is able, I still don’t think that
is the answer.
A cut in transport costs, including
personal travel, is the most useful con-
cession that I, as a grazier’s wife, can
suggest. Certainly our local licensed
carrying services have to provide a living
for the men who run them. The local bus
service, which also carries the mails and
links us with the nearest shopping-centre
and the railhead 50-odd miles away, also
has to pay driver’s wages and provide its
proprietors with a living. And, because
we are some hundreds of miles from the
capital city, petrol and other charges are
already higher for them than for people
in similar undertakings nearer the city.
Surely the Government could devise some
form of subsidy so that the cost of these
utilities to us outback people is no higher
than to the man close to the centre of
things.
Transport costs make our living
expenses very much dearer. Our local
storekeeper is allowed to pass on his
freight-charges and does so, with the
result that almost every item on my
grocery-docket averages out twopence
higher than it does if I travel to the
market-town and shop there— and the
stores there are dearer again than city
stnrf^o
c.,e co ts operate against us on the
y, too. If we were near our
y ' " could drive our stock to
-■y thus paying only corn-
yard dues. From here we
ansport fees or travel the
; t>- era! days, incurring drover's
er incidental expenses. If
o; uitable for the local buyers
mere is the extra cost of jailing beasts to
one of the bigger markets, and if one
strikes a dull market rail costs and com-
mission leave very little return.
Lately my husband took a small draft
or sheep by transport to the local market.
He struck a dull day when the market
definitely favored the buyer. That did
not matter to the farmer who had brought
his sheep to the yards himself. He
simply took them home, to return a few
days later and jget his price. Having
already incurred transport costs of over
ss. per head we were faced with a similar
charge to take them home and a further
charge to bring them back, not to mention
loss of bloom by handling and loss of
time to ourselves. Consequently we sold,
at a price considerably below the real
market-value, rather than incur the extra
expense and risk of striking a dull market
a second time.
Where personal travel is concerned I
am not much inconvenienced, for I am
content with life in the country, but I
sympathise with the women from the cities
—and we are getting more of them
among' us. A day among the shops is a
tonic for homesickness and helps to keep
them contented with their country life.
but it can’t be undertaken lightly when
bus-fares alone come to well over £2, and
lunch and similar extras have to be added.

The unkind cut was aimed at the Aus-
tralian Press, the Australian sporting
public and, obliquely, at the Australian
gold-medallists. I sympathise with the
view, often put forward by The
Bulletin, that many Australians are far
too “sporting-mad,” but a certain interest
in sport is healthy and desirable for a
balanced outlook.
I. see no harm, therefore, in the Aus-
tralian papers “playing-up” the success
of Australia’s representatives at Helsinki.
National sentiment demands that the
feats of the Aussies at the games g’‘ ven
a certain prominence. The Australian is
naturally more interested in the doings
of his compatriots than in those of
athletes of other countries, even if the
latter are far the better. Every other
country, anyway, would have paid more
attention to the achievements of its own
performers.
As for the gibe about “Marge”—well,
after all, Marjorie Jackson was the out-
standing woman athlete of the games ;
so the amount of newspaper-space
allotted to the chronicling of her deeds
was justified. Australia is proud of the
fact that the world’s fleetest woman is
an Australian.—K. Ross 1 (Vic.),
Union
While agreeing with most of D.
Empson’s remarks on the need for a
more compact form of government (B.
30/7/ 52), I don’t think that the men
who arranged our Federation “took the
wrong turning.” After all, it stopped the
dnft-apart of six separate States and we
became “one nation.” If a referendum
for “unification” had then been put to the
people it would almost certainly have
been turned down.
Even now, with the needless expense
and friction of seven Parliaments, it is
doubtful if the electors would be willing
to give the Federal Government supreme
and unified power, although I quite agree
with “D.E.” that it would be in the best
interests of Australia that the change be
made.
I feel sure, however, that the electors
would pass a referendum initiating this
reform if it also gave us the “recall,” so
that we should have some control even
between elections. —M. C. (Vic.).
Australia would gain no benefit were
her Federal form of government replaced
by one Parliament “with supreme and
unchallengeable powers” (B. 30/7/’52).
So highly centralised a polity is unsuit-
able to such a large country. Even in
far smaller States an ultra-unitary Con-
stitution has been found unduly
cumbrous.
Enthusiasts are fond of citing Great
Britain to support their claim. For years
past, however, the congestion of Parlia-
mentary business in that country has been
causing concern. It has even been pro-
posed that the House of Commons should
be divided into two sections, one confined
to foreign affairs, the other to domestic.
Indeed it seems likely that there will
soon have to be a division of powers be-
tween the national government and local
authorities.
The Federal type of government offers
far greater obstacles to totalitarianism
than does one that is highly centralised.
Federalism saved Australia after 1918
from having a permanent Socialistic
regime forced on it against popular
desire. When Lang embarked on his
repudiationist policy it provided the means
to get rid of him without civil strife.
Were Britain’s Constitution Federal,
Attlee would have found implementation
of his Socialistic programme a much
more thorny proposition. Parochially-
minded politicians and those who, put
party before the nation are as charac-
teristic of unitary States as of the Federal.
Britain has her counterparts of our
Cahills, McDonalds and Evatts.
Australia’s Federal Constitution, after
half a century, needs overhauling. It is
a written Constitution, and a written
Constitution requires regular revision to
bring it up-to-date. There should be
reallocation of State and Federal powers
and provision for the easy creation of new
States, such as is found in the U.S.
Constitution. Federalism would function
more impressively in Australia if each of
the larger States were divided into several
of moderate size.—Den (N.S.W.).
Soldier Settlement
Figures for one estate in western Vic-
toria seem to illustrate that soldier-
settlement is one of the keys to greater
food-production. This estate produced
50,0001 b. weight of wool before the pro-
perty was purchased; after it had been
subdivided into 15 single-unit farms it
returned 107,6431 b. weight of wool,
82961 b. of butterfat, 675 tons of cereals
and 2743 dozen eggs.
These figures could probably be
matched in every other soldier-estate in
Victoria. A carefully planned progressive
acquisition of some of the large areas
now' only in partial production would
ensure that Australia reaches its food
targets in the shortest possible time.—
Plain Australian (Vic,).
Government Bonds
As a banker I don’t agree with
“C.8.M.” (B. 6/8/’52). The wrath of
any investor in Commonwealth bonds
who loses money through having to sell
below par should be on the head of the
loan-organiser, bank-manager, stock-
broker, solicitor or trustee who advised
him he could expect near-par realisation if
in need of cash, and not on the head of
Treasurer Fadden, whose attitude, in my
opinion, is completely correct.
Commonwealth bonds guarantee
regular interest payments, at a rate satis-
factory to the investor at the time of
investment, and return of capital at
maturity. Nothing more or less. Any
adviser who does not impress on his client
that he is completely dependent on the
open-market price offering if he has to
realise before maturity is doing a great
disservice to the client and to Govern-
ment borrowing from the public.
Bonds are for the investor who is pre-
pared to go the distance and wants safety
of income and capital, not for the chap
who wants it both ways. He can either
put his money on fixed deposit and play
safe or take it on the chin if he picks a
loser. —H. J. D. (N.S.W.).
