FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
has real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

Literary Oddities
Every year or so the book-reading world
gets excited about some publication, not on
account of its merits as a work of art, but
because of its freakishness. That epic liar
Trader Horn achieved fame in this way,
and before him Louis de Rougemont.
Writers of the sort become best-sellers
partly, of course, because they have some-
thing new to say and an interesting manner
of saying it, but partly, also, because they
have the luck to be discovered and boomed
by some famous author. Where would “The
Little Visiters” have been without Barrie?
Other works just as quaint are continually
appearing,, but somehow they pass un-
noticed. Characteristics which should earn
them places as literary museum-pieces in
thousands of homes are only appreciated by
a handful. The material is there; all they
lack is a celebrated writer to supply a pre-
face drawing attention to it. Three
examples are reviewed below.
Anglo-Chicago
Desperado, by John Hunter (Cassell;
Dymocks; 7s. 6d.), describes the adventures
of Les Foster, a young West End of London
car-salesman. Les is introduced to Si
Calvert in a Piccadilly bar. He is impressed
by Calvert’s good looks, Savile-row clothes
and apparent wealth. Calvert, who is the
head of a gang of burglars, wants him for
his skill as a car-driver and public-school
voice and manner. He is tricked into steal-
ing a fast car, and Calvert and he escape
in it after a smash-and-grab raid on a
jeweller’s shop. He joins the gang, be-
comes infatuated with Calvert’s lovely
mistress Kay (neglecting his humble
Streatham sweetheart Norah), participates
in other crimes and eventually—— But his
fate is immaterial. The fantastic feature
of -this novel is that it depicts a collection
of Londoners who talk and think like
American gangsters. When Les first strolls
into the Piccadilly bar he finds the pro-
prietor shooting poker dice with Skitts
Rafferty. “Hello, gorgeous,” he says to the
barmaid. “Have one with me.” (Quite the
old Etonian.) “That’s fine,” says Calvert
after a talk about cars. “Is that O.K., Les?”
Les experiences a momentary uneasiness
when he gets outside.
As he boarded the ’bus he saw the big
fellow with the broad shoulders. He was
still standing on the pavement looking about
him idly. Bum sort of guy, anyhow.
On one of Les’s excursions into the
country with Calvert they are accompanied
by Marcel, a member of the gang. Marcel
is .shot. Calvert explains: “I took Marcel
for a ride.” In spite of Calvert’s relentless
ways Les philanders with Kay, and she
duly gets hers according to Hollywood
tradition.
“I’ll wring his blasted neck for him.”
“I should,” said Kay coolly.
He took her by the jacket, bunching it
in his grip across her breast, and pulled
her towards him.
“And don’t hand me your snappy come-
back.”
He struck her twice heavily with his flat
hand, bringing it across her cheek, still
holding her so that she did not skittle side-
ways under the blows.
And now the gang begins to break up.
Rafferty tells Les he has had enough of
Calvert.
“You mean you’d walk out on Si?”
“Yeah. I’m hanging for no man. And
hanging there’s gonna be before this racket’s
through.
A description by Rafferty (an ordinary
Cockney crook) of an enemy:—
1 “There was Mendoza. I told you about
him in Si’s place. He was slick, slick as
hell. And a tough gviy, too. Six feet one
in his socks, and weighed about a hundred
and ninety pounds, and didn’t think twice
before hitting you.”
There isn’t one recognisable Londoner, nor
a single English idiom, in the book, yet it
is offered by a famous London publishing-
house as an authentic picture of English
life.
St. Cecilia Up-to-date.
The heroine of Mundy’s Child, by Alice
Bindley (Philip Allan; 7s. 6d.), is a sophisti-
cated blonde, like Anita Loos’s famous
creation; Tony Wysard’s illustrations give
her the same appearance of wide-eyed
idiocy, and her habits and manner of speech
are much the same. The difference is that
she and her sister Toots are Bright Young
Things. Mundy is 19, Toots 18. Their
adventures in search of wealthy husbands
are described by Mundy in letters to her
godfather. They meet a charming young
rajah.
Perfect English,
of course, better
than ours, and
lovely clothes. Keep
calm, we’ve not
fallen for him, tho’
I’ll admit Toots
suggested what she
calls “Offering Herself” for his longest string
of pearls! Arc you shocked? She has been
in particularly good form lately, that young
woman.
Mundy leaves the Continental city where
her father is an ambassador for a grouse
moor in Scotland (“Needless to say I got
picked up on the boat”), and in the train
meets Sir Nicholas (“Tall and as brown
as a berry, with black hair and blue eyes
and the figure of an archangel Nicky
the great, the wonderful, the girl-hater, the
married woman’s pet”), and, of course, he
turns out to be one of the house-party.
Nicky, who is inordinately rich, duly falls
for her, but it isn’t all plain sailing. The
engagement has hardly been announced
when Toots appears in Mundy’s room.
“Dear sister,” she said, falling on her
knees beside my bed and putting her head
on the pillow in an exaggerated attitude of
woe. “I have spent the night with a Man!”
I sprang up with a loud yell and pushed
the little wretch off. “What have you been
up to, really, you little ass?” I begged. “In
pity’s name stop trying on my drawers.
Is it a joke?”
Not only has Toots spent the night with
a man (though in all innocence) but she
has signed Mupdy’s name in the hotel regis-
ter. To make matters worse, Toots has her
eye on a promising meal-ticket.
Lord Eilley is very much in love with her,
I think, but he is just the sort of correct
rather prim young man who thinks Young
Girls should be like Flowers, AHEM.
Toots doesn’t worry, and leaves for a
charity function with no concern except
that the florists have sent her pink instead
of white flowers.
“Clever my eye,” said Toots. “Florists
aren’t paid to think. What do you suppose
my carrots will look like under these bloody
blossoms ?”
Mrs. Bellairs, one of Nicky’s old flames,
gets hold of the story about the hotel,
and the sisters have to intrigue skilfully to
defeat her and land their young men.
If Mundy and Toots were presented as
what they are, namely, gold-diggers who,
behind a fagade of prattling imbecility,
conceal a cynical knowledge of what they
want from men and the easiest way to get
it, their history might have points as a
study in feminine guile. But their creator
wants it both ways. She asks readers
to believe that young women can talk and
to outward seeming behave like street-
walkers and remain Brownies at heart.
The miracle has never happened in the
history of organised society, and every man
and woman who knows human nature knows
it never can happen.
Journalese in High Places
Sir Raymond Beazley is Professor of
History at Birmingham University. In
The Road to Ruin in Europe (Dent; 3s.
6d.) he epitomises the events on the Con-
tinent and in Britain between 1890 and
1914 which led to the World War. His
survey distributes the blame judicially
among all the nations. Germany didn’t
plot the war, and made genuine efforts to
avert it. He thinks it “unlikely that Pan-
Slav and anti-Teutonic forces would have
started the rolling of that fatal ball at Sara-
yevo without a confident hope of British
support,” and that without British support
“Germany and her Allies would have
gained a victory—a kind of triumph.”
Britain didn’t plot or want the war either.
In common with the other nations it moved
blindly to its undoing. The astonishing thing
about the book is its style. The British
Empire is “the Island Empire”: there is “a
tolerant attitude in London and through-
out the Island Empire,” for “the time is
not yet ripe in the Island Empire.”
Edward VII. is “the Crowned Diplomatist,”
and. again “the crowned diplomatist” (with-
out capitals). Bismarck is “the giant.”
Most of the old newspaper cliches appear—
“Descent to Avernus,” “Men in the Street,”
“Dropping of the Pilot,” “apples of the
Dead Sea” and so on; and the author has
a passion for inverted commas, which he
uses as inconsistently as he does his
capitals. “Naval ‘drive’” on page_ 26 be-
comes “Naval Drive” on page 27. This is
probably the first book that has been
written by one of Sir Raymond Beazley’s
cultural standing in the English of a
champion cricketer.

Customs Department shouldn’t have banned
it as an obscene publication. The legal
definition of an obscene publication is one
“tending to corrupt those whose minds are
open to immoral influences.” Gross writing,
whether in the Old Testament, in Eliza-
bethan drama or in James Joyce, never had
an aphrodisiac effect on anybody—on that
every sensible parson, priest, doctor and
social student are agreed. Many writers lay
themselves out to be inflammatory, and
they succeed in proportion as they manage
to avoid grossness. Elinor Glyn, who imi-
tated the popular French feuilleton-writers
of her day, was a leading British exponent
of the art. Her adulteresses might have to
face agonising emotional storms but they
always did.it delightfully in delightful sur-
roundings. In any case the proportion of
readers liable to be demoralised by read-
ing fanciful romances like “Three Weeks” is
small. The books that do the damage—
and it is indisputable that some have a
damaging effect on certain communities —
are of an altogether different type.
It was idiotic of the Customs authorities
to ban “Brave New World,” which deals
with a fanciful society of a singularly un-
alluring kind, and which makes such a slight
appeal to the general reader that, up to the
time of the interdict, only a few hundreds
had been sold here. It was equally idiotic,
assuming they have the moral welfare of
impressionable young Australians at
heart, to let in (say) F. E. Bailey’s Supper
Time (Collins; 7s. 6d.).
This novel is about a fashionable Mayfair
family. The still-beautiful wife, aged 45, is
in love with a young dramatist. The good-
looking husband, aged 50, has had a series
of intrigues, and is now in love with Lady
Mary Philbeach, aged 22, who wants him to
marry her. The wife wants to divorce him
and marry the dramatist. Their son, a
cavalry subaltern, is being blackmailed by
a girl with whom he spent a night while
drunk. He tells his mother, who threatens
to expose the girl’s relations with an artist,
and so saves the situation. The other
member of the family is a daughter married
to one Esme, a waster. Esme is faced with
ruin unless his father-in-law gives him
£6OOO at once, and Dorothy goes after the
money. On the way she calls on a friend.
Over a cocktail apiece they talked with the especial
frankness of two young brides. They discussed
candidly and in detail their own love-lives, their
husbands’ love-lives and the love-lives of their girl-
friends and their husbands, the details of the girl-
friends’ husbands’ love-lives having been revealed
by the girl-friends. Dorothy inquired tenderly as
to the progress of an extra-marital love-affair of
Lisa.
“But, Lisa, have you actually deceived Arthur,
as the saying is?”
“My dear, if you really knew Charles you’d
realise it wasn’t a case of half-measures. How
grand it seems that I should have qualified as a
bad girl. Frankly, I find it terribly exhilarating.”
Everything turns out happily, and the
reader is glad, for these handsome,
amiable, beautifully-dressed amoralists are a
likeable lot. But it isn’t either the ending
or the likeableness or otherwise of the
characters that matters; it is the impression
which the book gives of being an accurate
picture of life. • One would diagnose that
Mr. Bailey had told the truth about the
kind of British family which produces
Bright Young Things even if hundreds of
English novelists and dramatists hadn’t
written in the same vein of late years.
Australian society—meaning the thousands
whose names figure in the social columns of
the papers—is essentially imitative; and
these thousands have tens of thousands of
imitators in outer suburbs and back-
blocks towns. The blurb of Supper Time
claims for Mr. Bailey that he has “the
greatest following of women readers of
any author living to-day” (which is the
publisher’s way of asking women to read
his books), and the Australian Booksellers’
Association, in its list of “Novels for Popu-
lar Reading,” stars Evelyn Waugh’s “Black
Magic”! “Cabby knows his fare.”
My point is this. If we must have a
censorship in Australia, for God’s sake let it
direct its attention to the only imported
books which are capable of doing what
moralists regard as moral harm; in other
words, books which encourage drunkenness
and promiscuity by representing them as the
favorite diversions of the more attractive
members of the British ruling classes.
JERMYN STREET.
And a Little Verse
SIMILE.
My mind is like a citadel sloping to ruin
by the sea.
The pock-marked moon lights up my towers,
The arrowy gulls scream over me.
Wearily, eerily, all day long
Rolls the guttupal sea’s dark song,
Impregnate in the heart of me.
Between the fair clear sand and sea
I slant t 0 ruin. Day by day
The humpbacked waves, the hurtling spray
Slash at my stone; and night by night
Seamed shadow and the, stained moon’s light
Restore my long magnificence.
Wrapped in the dirt’s indifference,
Moon-silvered in moon-leprosy,
I dominate the sky and sea,
And valiant thoughts like ruffling ghosts
Invade, in slippery-footed hosts,
My mind’s deserted corridors.
There is a banging of old doors,
There is a whispering of old words,
But day. brings back the harsh, mad birds
And all my crumbling poverty.
My mind is like a citadel sloping to ruin
by the sea.

MICHAEL JORDAN.
J. Le Gay Brereton
His verse, which was singularly personal,
expressed the man: his benignity, his wide
tolerance and his scholarliness. He could
love, but he couldn’t hate. Much of his best
work was done during the war. He could
only be angry with War. The spectacle of
poor old Kretschmann creeping about the
streets of Sydney tore at his heartstrings.
He was old and grey and weary, death and he
were long at grips,
Evil whispers hissed behind him, German to the
finger-tips.
War’s wild fury snarled about him, so he gently
stepped aside,
Loving us and loving Germans, heavy-hearted, and
he died.
It is easy to feel that way now; it took
a great man to do it seventeen years ago.
No recent Australian writer except Brennan
has used the sonnet form quite so easily
and naturally.
THE DEAD.
Hail and farewell to those who fought and died,
Not laughingly adventurous, nor pale
With idiot hatred, nor to fill the tale
Of racial selfishness and patriot pride,
But merely that their own souls rose and cried
Alarum when they heard the sudden wail
Of stricken freedom, and along the gale
Saw her eternal banner quivering wide.
Farewell, high-hearted friends, for God is dead
If such as you can die and fare not well—
If when you fall your gallant spirit fail.
You are with us still, and can we be adread
Though Hell gape, bloody-fanged and horrible?
Glory and hope of us who love you, Hail!
He had a happy life at the University,
where he was beloved, and Fate was kind
to him to the end. When he was in the
full tide of health and spirits he wrote: —
When my time is come to die
I would shun the decent gloom,
Whispered word and weeping eye,
Fitful hum of moving fly
Questing through the darkened room.
I would lay my skin and bone
Where no busy care could trace
Failing steps by bush and stone,
With my farewell dream > alone
In a bird-frequented place.
And his time came when he was with his
sons on a bush caravan tour.
A Satchel of Books
The Countryman (2s. 6d.), which is pub-
lished quarterly at Idbury, in Oxfordshire,
is not only a sort of official organ of the
English agriculturist but a delight to all true
naturalists, flower-lovers and students of
rural lore. The latest (Jan.) issue has an
article by the Marquess of Tavistock entitled
“My Spiders,” a third instalment of Sir
Austen Chamberlain’s “Gardening Experi-
ences” and some fascinating stuff about
birds. Avoid it if you are English and don’t
want to be made nostalgic for the sights
and sounds of the English countryside.
Forlorn Island, by Edison Marshall
(Hodder and Stoughton; 7s. 6d.), is a tale
of fantasy, adventure and love in Alaska.
Eric Ericssen was the son of a .couple that
had come from Norway to the north-west
to dig for gold and remained to fish for
salmon and halibut. The big thrill comes
after Eric’s discovery that Nan, the heroine,
loves him. She has hardly come to him
when the terrifying Sandomar, who has the
strength of ten a.nd the malignancy of a
demon, arrives at their shack preceded by
a 200-pound boulder which he has sent
crashing through the roof. Then an all-in
fight with tomahawks and the triumph of
true love. The Lost People of the isle to
which Paul Golilcoff came in the 18th cen-
tury aren’t nearly so convincing as the de-
scriptions of the scenery and of the emotions
of the principals.
Snow on Water, by Merle Eyles . (Faber
and Faber; 7s. 6d.). Another war-time
novel. Pietolan is a Finnish student who
has been brought up to hate Russians, un-
knowing that he is half-Russian himself.
With some other youths he arranges to ski
to a place on the Swedish coast from which
they can get to Germany, and there be trained
to fight against the hereditary oppressor when
Finland revolts. They are betrayed, and all
except Pietolan are butchered by a Russian
detachment. He muses on the futility of
war.
It was only an accident that had made him a
Finn—in name. He might have been fighting in
one of the trenches, or lying dead, or being used
for soap. He had heard rumors that the English
cut up their dead to make soap and candles. All
this warfare was stupid. All this race-hatred was
stupid.
The book is in that minor key throughout,
and it ends consistently with the suicide of
the hero.
Sister of the Sun, by Sonia Keppel (Chap-
man and Hall; 7s. 6d.), is yet another story
of English society as it was before the war,
and as it became afterwards. The style
is chatty and feminine.
The journey out to St. Moritz was a distinct
strain to Florence and Bridget, who maintained
supine attitudes for most of the way. Austin
achieved a great deal for their comfort with bribes,
but, nevertheless, they continued to wish themselves
at home. Florence became a positive Cassandra
prophesying that no good would come of the trip.
The ending of the Victorian era, the war
years, the political and economic changes
of the post-Armistice period, and particularly
the reactions to them of the leisured classes,
are all handled in this light manner. There
is no depth to the book at any stage. Georgia
Fane, who was born a month after Queen
Victoria’s death, is the central figure, and
there is no depth to her either. She is one
of those conventionally unconventional lasses
who swarmed in London after the war got
into its stride.
“Your mother has been here, Georgie,” said
Marian gently. “Where were you?”
“At the Bull Hotel. I spent the night there.”
“By yourself?”
“No. With a young Tommy. It wasn’t because
I liked him, Aunt Marian, Bjut he was frightened
of going back. And he had nothing to do till his
train left at four.”
Characteristically, by 1932, she has taken
up flying. We make our farewells as she
is leaving Lympne for Capetown. “Would
Georgia come back?” is the last sentence,
and the answer, we fancy, is “Yes. Next
year, in a sequel.”

LANG’S NEW PROGRAMME.
John Thomas Lang, the fool or knave who
brought Australia to the threshold of civil
war last year, has apparently neither learned
anything nor repented of anything. He
is still, it seems, proud that he defaulted,
and ready to default again; he speaks of
having had “victory almost within our
grasp” when “we were struck down by the
assassin’s hand,” victory being Sovietism
and the assassin the Governor of N. S.
Wales. But Mr. Lang is not discouraged,
or professes not to be: put him in power
again and he will, he says, hurry on the
process of “socialisation,” the thin disguise
under which Communism and Sovietism and
Bolshevism are working to-day. “Socialisa-
tion of credit,” he told a conference, “must
be our immediate objective,” though he
presently found occasion to say that with it
should come unification. “It must,” he added,
“be apparent to any observer of Australia’s
efforts to free herself from the depression
that the chief obstacles have been private
control of the financial system and lack of
unity as a nation.”
Now, what is this credit which Mr. Lang
wants to “socialise”? We say of a man
that his credit is good, of a country that its
credit is sound. There is nothing for either
Mr. Lang or his hungry hunters in national-
ising that sort of credit; but there might be
a great deal for both of them if they could
secure the exclusive right to give or to
withhold credit to State and citizens alike.
And it is no less than this they claim, on the
plea that what the banks give—financial
credit —is something which costs them noth-
ing, and is in fact not theirs but the public’s.
The “public credit,” Mr. Lang says, “is
in the hands of private enterprise. What
the people must do at the next election is
to place in the Commonwealth Parliament
a party pledged to take the control of the
public credit out of the hands of private
enterprise and hand it over to the control
of the people.”
The argument is simple. In “The Blight
of the Banker,” the whole thing is ex-
plained. Jones lodges £lOO in notes on fixed
deposit. The banker knows that on the
average only 7 p.c. of the amounts drawn
are required in cash. So he drops £7 in the
till and puts by £93 to play with. Now a
farmer comes in and wants an advance.
The banker knows that the farmer will
draw cheques and that the 7 p.c. average
will apply here, too; so he will be safe
in advancing £1328 on the strength of
having Jones’s £93. He therefore advances
£1328, on which he charges 7i p.c., or
£99 12s. a year; and the farmer gives a
mortgage over his property. Observe, say
Mr. Lang and the “social credit” gospel-
lers—Mr. Lang probably with his tongue in
his cheek—“observe that the bank does not
pay out one penny of its own money. The
£5 interest it pays to Jones is supplied out
of the farmer’s £99 12s. interest. The bal-
ance is what the bank gets for doing
nothing but keeping books.” Further, the
farmer was given an advance upon his own
asset or credit. He was, in plain English,
so it is claimed, lent his own property and
was charged interest for the use of it. As
one furious commentator puts it:—
Mr. Farmer is one of the nation. His farm is
one of the national assets; and the bank, with an
impertinence that passes belief, lends the nation’s
credit to the nation in return for the use, not of
the nation’s currency, which it does pot possess, but
for spurious currency, which the bank produces at
no cost to itself.
So we have Mr. Lang demanding that the
control of this national asset, this public
or social credit, shall be taken out of the
hands of private enterprise and given into
the control of the people—which, of course,
means the politicians, and which Mr. Lang
hopes will mean Mr. Lang.
Now, what are the facts concerning that
loan we have just heard about? Mr. Lang
says that what the bank lent was public
credit; it did not use a penny of its own
money. First let us see what a bank is.
It is a dealer in money: it borrows and it
lends. It puts up some capital of its own,
and on the strength of that it may, perhaps,
borrow seven times as much. But since
there is no profit in borrowing, but on the
contrary only expense, it lends out that
borrowed money; and, as we have seen, a
farmer sometimes borrows it. Now we can
leave the books and the newspapers and go
into any farming or grazing district in Aus-
tralia, The case of the grazier who gives
his hard personal experience on this very
page to-day will serve as well as any. He
has borrowed £lO,OOO on a property which
to-day is not worth £6ooo—he doubts if it
would fetch more than £3OOO. The bor-
rower cannot pay what he has borrowed;
indeed, he is getting further and further
into debt. The bank must keep the place
going to preserve the asset; it knows that
it can never get the £lO,OOO back; but it
knows that it must pay the lender —the
depositor—every penny of the £lO,OOO
it has borrowed from him. On present
appearances, on that one loan it will lose
£5OOO, probably more. In the ’nineties the
banks of Australia lost altogether something
like 11 millions in this way. To-day, if their
depositors called on the banks as certain
depositors did in the ’nineties, and if securi-
ties had to be quickly realised in conse-
quence, shareholders would get out of the
business very well with a loss of 50 millions.
Yet there are stupid people, and some people
who are worse than stupid, who say banks
do not lend a penny of their own.
In this respect the banks are not in any
different position from the little grocer
down the street. He buys from the mer-
chants and sells to customers. He could do
without any capital of his own if every-
body paid promptly. But the moment the
little grocer strikes a bad debt it is his
pocket that has to suffer. The money of
the good marks flows. automatically to the
merchants, with 15 or 20 pic. deducted for
expenses; all the bad debts are his own.
He gets his profit, in short, for guaranteeing
the merchants their money whether the cus-
tomer who finally buys the goods pays or
not; and that is precisely the position of the
banker.
But the politicians who despise the intelli-
gence of their audience can always depend
upon winning cheers by an attack upon
the banks and the “great financial inter-
ests”; and if those who ought to do their
share in combating this propaganda let it
go by default, these politicians may even
win a majority of the votes. It is just as
well therefore that they should realise what
it is that is aimed at. Fortunately Mr.
Lang has left the tremendous consequences
of the matter in no doubt. “Control of
credit,” he declares, “is of far more import-
ance than control of all the post offices and
railways in the world.” And Lang is right.
Transfer of the monopoly of credit to the
political party in power could close up every
private business in the land. It could pay
off the “Labor Daily’s” debt to Mr. Lang
and subsidise the paper with £5OOO a month
to “compete” with the “S. M. Herald” and
“Daily Telegraph.” It could make terms
with every crook in the country to finance
his tin-hare course or fruit-machine on con-
dition that he paid the advertising bills
of the party in office and provided its
friends and relations with motor-cars and
week-end bungalows. It could make things
easy for every political friend and impos-
sible for every political opponent.
And Mr. Lang will have no silly talk
about self-determination and the rights of
communities to some say in their own
government. If Mr. Lang and his friends
of Woolloomooloo and Surry Hills like
the idea of getting control of “public
credit”—like the idea of signing cheques
on the national account for the benefit
of their political and other friends and
supporters—who are the farmers of N. S.
Wales and Victoria or the citizens of Tas-
mania or South Australia or Westralia that
they should stand in the way? So to his
policy of seizing the exclusive right to give
overdrafts and other financial credit Mr..
Lang joins unification—on the principle
that if you are going to rob a bank you
might as well rob a big one.
Mr. Lang, being a man whose business
it is to get votes, and who has told us
before that the man who will promise the
most loot will get the most votes, assures
his intended victims that prosperity lies in
doing the things he now advocates. Well,
what precisely are we suffering from? The
. figures show a steady improvement in busi-
ness and employment during the past six
months. There is not the faintest shadow
of doubt about the reason. With the dis-
missal of Lang and his gang of boodlers,
confidence began slowfy to return, not
merely to N. S. Wales but to all Australia.
While these men were in power nobody
knew what was going to happen next.
Already the Government Savings Bank of
N. S. Wales had closed its doors, and so
hopeless was the outlook that distressed
depositors were accepting a few shillings in
the £. This country will not have to return
Mr. Lang to power to weaken if not destroy
the confidence which has been putting a
new face on Australia. It will be sufficient
to even make it look possible that Mr.
Lang might be returned. The forces that
are against the seizure of the national credit
and its transfer to the people who broke
the Government Savings Bank of N. S.
Wales and had their election expenses paid
out of the tin-hare money—the forces
against this calamity are surely over-
whelming. But unless great damage is to
be done, we must show that these forces are
awake to the tragedy that being prepared
for them and for Australia.
UNIFICATION.
Mr. Lang wants unification as well as the
socialisation of credit. “There are seven
Governments,” he says, “and every time
they meet in conference there is discord.”
What Mr. Lang really means, of course, is
that every time he meets his brother-
Premiers they stand in the way of his
schemes. This is discord. Well, thank God
for discord!
One of Australia’s greatest curses and
heaviest handicaps is the congregation of
an overwhelming proportion of its people
in a few swollen cities. In N. S. Wales, as
in Victoria and S. Australia, more than
half the population is within the metropoli-
tan area! This means that a great deal
more than half the political power in each
of these States is within the metropolis,
because a compact mass can always exercise
more political pressure than the same num-
ber of people scattered over a wide area.
Out of this has arisen what is known in
N. S. Wales as the Country Movement —a
movement, in effect, to shake off the
stranglehold which the city has on the
country and give the latter an opportunity
to govern itself in its own interests. What
Mr. Lang aims at is to increase the strangle-
hold. It is not enough that a largely-indus-
trial population in one great overgrown
city should control the entire State, from
Tweed Heads, in the nor’-east, to Went-
worth, in the sou’-west, just upon 900 miles
away; what the people of S. Australia and
Queensland and Westralia and Tasmania are
asked to approve is that they shall be put
under the control of the great industrial popu-
lations of N. S. Wales and Victoria. Between
them these two States hold 4,300,000 people
out of Australia’s total of 6,500,000.
It is true, of course, that in certain mat-
ters the smaller States have already allowed
themselves to be submerged by the greater.
But they always have the protection of the
Senate: in that Chamber the self-govern-
ing rights of the smaller States are safe-
guarded by the equal representation of all
States. Unification means, among other
things, the disappearance of the Senate.
In effect, of course, it means the disappear-
ance of a second Chamber altogether.
There was a time when unification had a
pleasant sound. We have had many object-
lessons since then. We have seen how ill
unification has worked in N. S. Wales, with
its area of a mere 309.432 square miles:
we can judge from that how it would work
over the whole Commonwealth’s area of
2,974,581 square miles. We have seen how
ill the attempt to legislate for the Northern
Territory from Canberra has worked out:
we can judge from that how it would work
if it were applied also to the vast areas of
Queensland and Westralia. We are told
of the savings that might be expected under
unification; but we know that the attempt
to administer the Northern Territory from
Canberra has been not only very expensive
but futile to the last degree.
THE GRAZIER AND HIS DEBTS.
From “Dialectica”:—
I should like to present my case, which 1
believe is typical of thousands. I owe
£lO,OOO on a property, and my interest bill
is £5OO a year. Shire rates, interest on
wool advances and so on come to another
£lOO a year; shearing, ctutching, dipping and
odd wages absorb as much between them.
1 must, therefore, get in £7OO a year in
order to meet these expenses. In addition,
my wife and I and our children must be fed
and clothed. In good years I run 1600
sheep, half lambing ewes and half dry sheep.
This year I received £450 for wool, after
paying freight, brokerage and so on. 1
marked 600 lambs, which, at 6s. a head,
brought me £lBO. So I grossed £630, and
my unavoidable expenses were £7OO, without
allowing for living expenses or taking into
consideration deaths and depreciation of
stock. I am down £7O for the year, although
it has been a good season and the stock have
done well. Since I cannot possibly reduce
my expenses, and cannot get more for my
produce than the market will give me, it is
not my fault I am losing money; I am
simply in the grip of circumstances.
I owe £6OO to unsecured creditors, and
cannot see that I shall ever be able to
pay them. Actually I am bankrupt, and in
theory I suppose I should hie my schedule;
but if I and the thousands in my position
do so, what shall we do to get a living?
And what sort o& a land crash would there
be if thousands of properties were suddenly
dumped on an already weak market? The
only thing I can do is hang on, take advan-
tage of the Moratorium Act with regard to
interest payments, and hope for a rise in
prices; there seems an upward trend at
present and it may eventuate. But if it
does not and another drought follows the
present good season, I shall have no alterna-
tive but to get off my property, which is being
neglected for lack of money for repairs.
What will it be worth then? The man
from whom I bought it gave £3060 for it in
better times than these, and that seems to
be its real value. If he were voluntarily
to reduce the mortgage to, say, £6OOO, he
would really be better off because I should
be able to pay interest on that much, and
I should have a little to spend on destroying
rabbits (the place is alive with them and
I have no money to buy poisons and traps),
fencing (some of it will fall down soon for the
lack of a few hundred posts and a ton of
wire) and tanks (which are silting up).
Moreover, I should have an incentive to
work. If I go off the place, who the dickens
would be fool enough to want to pay him
the £lO,OOO I have contracted to pay? He
would have to take whatever he could get.
It is obvious that the writing down on a
grand scale of mortgages on sheep and wheat
properties must soon be done. I am heartily
sick of handing over 80 p.c. of my produce
to a mortgagee I never even see and who
does not labor on the place or take any of
the risk of sheep deals. Some day a lot of
us will drop the whole wretched business,
walk off and leave our mortgagees to
clean up the mess. Given another drought
in a year or two —and it must come —we
shall not have any option. There will be
plenty of writing down then.
My solution of the problem would be for
a number of boards to judge each case on
its own merits, the decision of each board to
be binding on both parties.
STILL MORE DOUGLAS CREDIT.
This at any rate can be said for the
Douglas Credit disciples: their zeal never
flags. The Bulletin is simply inundated
with letters trying to show this paper the
error of its ways. Some of these letters
are merely stupid; some are offensive
(Douglas Credit enthusiasts are not, as
a rule, conspicuous for courtesy); a few
are solid. From these last The Bulletin
chooses this letter because it goes closest to
the root of the whole matter. The writer
is Edgar Plumpton (Melbourne): —
“Cost,” Major Douglas has explicitly laid
down, is the core of the problem. Major
Douglas challenges the orthodox assumption
that, because all present collective costs are
the sum of past distribution of incomes,
the sum of present distributions of income
must be equal to the present collective costs,
i.e., prices. A cost is a record of past ex-
penditure (history), on the basis of which
somebody possesses a present claim to col-
lect it in present prices (law). But a fact
of the past and a present claim do not create
money. Yet money is assumed to be avail-
able to meet the cost. On what ground?
You practically state or assume that,
under the present system of costing and
selling, either there is no leakage of pur-
chasing-power during the period of produc-
tion, or that, if so, the leakage is made good
and available when the product is ready for
sale. If you cannot prbve that, then you
have no right to say that industry’s price to
consumers at any time measures the amount
of consumers’ incomes at that time. That
the money paid out in the past is still
existent is your false assumption, based on
the lack of appreciation of the fact that
money (credit) in its repayment to the bank-
ing system is cancelled and destroyed and
is non-existent then. It only comes into
existence again for further production and
incurs or produces at the same time its own
equivalent costs. It cannot be available to
purchase present consumable goods, and
so liquidate their costs, and also be available
and existent in the future to liquidate its
own ghost of costs which will appear in
future prices.
If the A + B theorem is not correct, it
would follow that the converse must be
correct. I will call this the P + D theorem
as follows: At any given time the total of
wages, salaries and dividends disbursed by
industry may be divided into two categories:
P, that part recoverable by industry
promptly: D, the remaining part, the re-
covery of which is deferred. The ratio
between P and D is the same as the ratio
between the amount of real wealth bought
promptly from industry by the community
and the amount of real wealth left behind
for deferred delivery. This amount left
behind may be comprehensively defined as
real capital; and its money value (at cost)
as financial capital, or F.C. In that case,
at any given time Dis equal to F.C.; which
means that the community possesses at any
time, as existent money, a margin of spare
income equal to the cost value of all exist-
ing capital assets. The existing capital
assets of Australia are statistically esti-
mated as between 3000 million pounds and
5000 million pounds. Then there must be
in existence in Australia at least 3000
million pounds actual money. Is this so? I
do not think so. If you think so, and your
opposition to the A + B theorem would in-
dicate that you subscribe to this conclusion,
would you kindly indicate where and in
what form is this money in actual existence?
On which The Bulletin remarks:—
Here are a pair of boots. In their cost of
production are the price of the leather and
other materials, and the wages, and the rent
of the shop, and something for light and
power. Mr. Plumpton denies (as they all
do) that the purchasing-power paid out for
the production of the leather is still existent.
The leather merchant worked on an over-
draft and when he was paid for the leather
and in turn paid in this money to the
bank the debt was simply cancelled,
they say. Therefore, they ask, how can the
complete cost of those boots be available for
their purchase? Now, that drives us back to
the leather merchant. He was in business, and
to buy more skins went to his banker, who
lent him (say) £5OO. This money he paid
out to graziers and workers in his yard; a
little he kept for himself. Then he sold the
finished leather and pajd off the debt. But
that didn’t destroy the money he had paid
to the grazier or his workmen or the little
he had kept for himself.
Yes, it is answered, but the money paid
to these people was long ago spent. This
only means that it was passed into other
hands; it still exists, in some form, no
matter how many hands it has passed
through.
But, Mr. Plumpton counters, if there is
enough purchasing-power in the country to
buy all the things that have ever been pro-
duced, then, since the existing capital assets
of Australia are over 3000 million pounds,
there must be over 3000 millions of actual
money in existence in Australia. Let’s go
back to that pair of boots again. If the
cost of producing them is represented by
purchasing-power, then the cost of producing
everything else must be represented by pur-
chasing-power. But who wants to keep all
his purchasing-power in money? The boot-
maker is saving up to buy a suit of clothes.
H'e puts the money in the savings bank;
and the savings bank lends it to somebody
else. Trade is simply one great system of
barter; and all the world needs is enough
counters to carry on this barter smoothly.
And now, as the Douglas Credit-ers have
asked us a question, let us ask them one.
If in the very nature of things there has
never been enough purchasing-power m the
world to buy all the things that have been
produced, where are the things that were
produced and could not be bought for lack
of purchasing-power in the reign of Leorge
111 v They must still be kicking around
somewhere. ' And the enormous heaps that
must have been produced in the. early days
of Queen Victoria and couldn t be bought
for lack of purchasing-power? What became
„f them? If they are not there because
they never existed, then the whole Douglas
Credit house of cards collapses.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Film Business.
So “the pictures” are a problem too; and
the Postmaster-General has been asked “to
protect the interests of the Australian pub-
lic in the matter of imported films.” Exactly
what is desired Mr. Parkhill does not say;
but various representative people, including
the president of the Film Society, have pub-
lished their desire for, a quota of British
Empire pictures.
The position is more complicated than
it looks. There would be no hesitation
about granting British pictures a very defi-
nite preference if they were generally the
equals of any other pictures. But there are
doubts on that point. From one cause and
another America won and long held an
easy lead as a maker of films. Whatever
else they were, the men who gained con-
trol of the “industry” had shrewd business
heads, and when they saw their monopoly
seriously threatened they changed their pro-
gramme. Realising that the time had come
when extravagance could not take the place
of quality, they proceeded first to produce
at home a few films of a much higher value
than their old output and then, by using
their enormous wealth and influence, to
secure the best principals a.nd producers
in Europe for a series of productions there.
The most brilliant and accurate picture of
contemporary English life that Australia has
seen on a screen was probably Lonsdale’s
“Aren’t We All?” with an all-Britteh cast
which included Gertrude Lawrence, Marie
Lohr a.nd Hugh Wakefield. It was one of
these productions, made for Paramount.
So was “Trouble in Paradise,” a brilliant
picture of Continental life, with a German
director and a cast of British and American
stars.
British companies, on the other hand,
came into the business equipped with not
much more than good intentions. They had
to face the competition of American groups
with vast resources in money and organisa-
tion, who not only knew the business from
A to Z but had most of the worth-while
artists and others tied to them. That, in
spite of all this, they have already made
great progress nobody denies. But there
still remains much to do. The “New States-
man and Nation” cannot be accused of lack
of patriotism; yet the latest number to hand
has this to say of the current film at the
London Plaza:—
The plot is futile, the humor flat; it moves with
agonizing slowness to a foregone conclusion, and
never attains mediocrity in acting, photography or
direction. We are always being told that the British
film industry now turns out a first-rate article, and
sudh pictures as “Rome Express’’ do indeed show a
considerable improvement in technique and general
intelligence. But, unfortunately, such a film as
“Riverhouse Ghost” still presents an epitome of all
these faults which we must be prepared to dis-
cover, in greater or less degree, in films coming from
British studios.
Nevertheless, granting all this about them,
if all-British films were being crowded out
of Australian picture-houses there would be
a case for action of some sort. But they
are not being crowded out; and, even if
the)r were, it is very doubtful whether action
in their interests should be by way of quota
legislation. The quota system is always
open to serious objection. It is an
announcement to the world that certain
things not good enough to stand on their
own merits are included to meet some poli-
tical or other exigency; and it would be a
doubtfully patriotic thing to put either
British or Australian films forward with
such an invitation to public pity and pos-
sibly scorn. None realise this better than
the makers of all-British films. “From a
national standpoint,” the representative of
one of the largest of these firms said the
other day, “it is a vital necessity that the
showing of British films should be fostered;
but not by a quota.” And he added that
his company had no difficulty in placing all
the films they could supply.
Legislation of some kind may be wanted.
But it is not legislation to force British
films upon us; rather it is legislation to pre-
vent any other interests forcing their films
upon us. For the rest dependence should
be placed upon those very serviceable
leagues and societies which have been
formed for the express purpose of popu-
larising British films. The representative
of the great British co. quoted above de-
clares that what they need is “fostering.”
These leagues and societies can do that;
Parliament cannot.
-
Exchange and Tariffs.
An interesting little cable which the Aus-
tralian dailies received a week ago was
stuffed away among the also-rans. It re-
ported that a vote in the U.S.A. House of
Representatives on legislation to increase
tariff rates against countries with depre-
ciated currencies was assured by the filing
of a petition signed by 150 members. The
petition had been signed speedily, it was
explained, after the Republican conference
had voted in favor of the plan.
Sooner or later this kick was bound to
come. In Australia, for example, we laid
ourselves out to get an advantage over
our competitors in overseas markets by giv-
ing our exporters a bonus of 30 p.c., later
reduced to 25 p.c., by manipulating ex-
change. It worked all right until others
dropped to the game. Then they made the
obvious reply: they gave their exporters
a bonus. And so the business has gone on
until, on a recent count, 42 countries had
depreciated their currency.
For a while it was only the primary pro-
ducer whom it was sought to benefit. But
very soon the manufacturer claimed the
same assistance; and the results there have
been very remarkable. In a report made
three or four months ago to the U.S. Cham-
ber of Commerce, it was declared that
British black steel was selling in New York
at 29 dollars, while the quotation for
American black steel was 49 dollars. In
1928 the Japanese made only 29 p.c. of
the miniature electric lamps used in the
U.S.A.; last year they made 84 p.c. Before
the yen fell from 46-i cents (U.S. money)
to 22 cents, the Japanese lamps were sold
in the U.S.A. at from 14 to 16 dollars per
thousand; after the fall, at from 5.50 to 6
dollars. And the rubber manufacturers
pointed out that the importation of the
goods in which they are interested had
increased sevenfold. So we get a further
answer to high exchange rates: the raising
of tariff walls at the very moment when
the economists of the world are declaring
that we shall never get back world-pros-
perity till we lower them.
There are times when a high exchange
rate is justified—when it is necessary in
order to secure and preserve a trade balance.
But that is a very different thing from
manipulating exchange in order to gain for
ourselves or a section of ourselves an advan-
tage over trade competitors; and those who
have pursued this policy of set purpose have
added greatly to the world’s economic diffi-
culties. As to the business morality of it,
we shall have to leave that for another
generation to decide.

The Tragedy of Canberra.
After giving it a fair trial Senator Cole-
batch has joined The Bulletin in believing
that Canberra can never be a success. The
expense of it is bad enough; but “the
greater calamity is that it can never operate
successfully. It is isolated from those
influences to which it should be close—the
press and public opinion. Ministers cannot
spend the time they should in their depart-
ments, and in consequence Australia is
losing good administration and good law-
making.” That covers much of the ground
on which The Bulletin stands. But there
is another point of very great importance.
At Canberra the politician is thrown too
much into the company of the public
servant; and together they are cut off
too much from the public. They are thus
inclined to form a group separated from the
people, with the result that the influence
of the public servant upon the politician is
far too great. Anything in the shape of
public-service economy, for which Aus-
tralia is calling so loudly, thus becomes
very difficult, and in some cases impossible.
And such a position must continue because
there is no prospect whatever of Canberra
ever having any population to speak of
apart from politicians and public servants.
Even at this late hour the whole business
ought to be reviewed. In the first place
what is Canberra costing us in cold cash?
How much more are we paying for service
at Canberra than we could' get the same
service for elsewhere? And in the second
place what is it costing us indirectly in the
ways indicated? On the other hand, do we
gain one single advantage in either legisla-
tion or administration from having the seat
of government in a remote village, miles
away even from a main railway line?

“An Overlooked Color Problem.”
“W.H.M.” writes from our Farthest North:
The problem of Queensland’s undeported
kanaka was bound to come up (B.
14/12/’32) ; a good many other problems
are arising from indentured labor used in
marine industries in Northern Australia—
it is bound to be so while men are brought
into the country without their womenfolk.
Already we are called upon to face the
question whether these indentured men shall
be allowed to marry Australian wives, or
simply continue in illicit alliance with
women whose children are added to our
“Australian-born” lists.
Here in Torres Strait we have some of the
kanakas who remained behind at the time
of . deportation. A number had married
Torres Strait wives, or wives of mixed
blood; on one island (Darnley) practically
all the population to-day consists of the de-
scendants of South Sea men, while other
islands carry a good percentage. The Gov-
ernment, however, 25 years ago set aside a
portion of one large island, Banks (known
better by the native name of Moa), about 30
miles north of Thursday, as a Pacific
Islanders’ Reserve; this is known as “St.
Paul’s,” and is under the control of the
Anglican Mission. There is now a com-
munity of 300 in that settlement alone. They
are a self-supporting community, earning
their living in the trochus, pearling and
beche-de-mering industries; and they have
a good reputation as skin divers and swim-
mers. Some of them are captains of fishing
luggers, working down the east coast, and
hold positions of responsibility. The infusion
of South Sea blood seems to have been
to the good so far as the Torres Strait
islanders are concerned; and a glance at
statistics will show that the community in
Torres Strait, which includes a large per-
centage of those of kanaka descent, is a
valuable asset, commercially, to Queensland,
producing a large amount of exportable
produce, and consuming goods the value of
which is by no means insignificant and upon
which they pay exactly the same charges
and duty as the white man. Under a policy
of wise education, in which the Government
and missions co-operate, they are being
fitted to take their place in the development
of the North.
The solution offered in the case of the
kanakas who remained round Mackay and
district, and whose descendants are increas-
ing so rapidly, is to place them on a fertile
island. There should be no difficulty about
finding an island, or a group of islands, for
that matter. Whether these people will
return to the past arts and skill of their
forefathers (to which they themselves are
strangers) is debatable; even in Torres
Strait the schools find it difficult to arouse
interest in mat-making and suchlike arts,
since modern civilisation and white-man
stores have given the younger generation so
different an outlook. But there certainly
seems to be scope for some scheme of settle-
ment whereby these “children of the sea”
might swell (to mention only one aspect) the
number of marine workers. There should
be no necessity for importing indentured
labor for getting marine products if our
own resources were properly trained and
utilised. And there are other industries for
which they are fitted. North Australia’s
empty spaces have a chance of being at any
rate partially filled by this colored popula-
tion of our own, which is steadily growing
and which surely ought not to be treated as
a waste product.
By some the utilisation of our colored
labor in cotton-growing has been suggested;
and it is probable that, were there a properly-
worked-out scheme by which families could
be settled on areas of land (island or main-
land) in the North, that idea would be a
workable one. It would mean organisation,
and also capital. But we should have to
face that.

John Le Gay Brereton.
The death of Professor Brereton removes
one of the most generous friends the Aus-
tralian writer ever had. It may be that he
was too generous. Within him heart and
head were perpetually in conflict, the one
bidding him offer encouragement without
reproof or correction, the other urging him
to criticise or condemn. Generally the
heart won; for Brereton never found it
difficult to persuade himself that it was
better for a man to do his poor best than
never to attempt at all. But it was far
more than vague encouragement he offered:
his counsel was as freely given. It was
thoroughly characteristic of him that, serv-
ing as one of the judges in The Bulletin’s
recent National Song Competition, he was
not content merely to choose the entries
he liked best'. “This, I think, could be im-
proved if so-and-so were done; and 'star-
crossed’ won’t do there”—and, with his
infinite patience, he proceeded to show why.
There must be a thousand poets and prose-
writers who have at some time or other
sent him their early efforts, and got from
him, in pages of notes, evidence of how
carefully he had studied their halting lines.
His own contribution to the literature of
Australia was considerable; his work first as
Librarian and then as Professor of English
Literature at Sydney University will be
enduring; his reputation as an authority
on Elizabethan texts is as wide as English
scholarship. But more deeply shrined in
the memory of Australian writers will be
his complete approachableness (The Bulle-
tin recalls how much he did for Henry
Lawson when Lawson was most in need of
friends) and the entire unselfishness of his
devotion to his country’s letters.

Old King Coal.
Dunningham. the N. S. Wales Minister
of Labor and Industry, has been on a
visit to the Newcasfcle-Maitland district,
where the best coal in the Southern
Hemisphere is mined. He knew from the
unemployed returns that many of the
people were in sore straits, but he was not
prepared for the pitiful sights that met
.his gaze or the harrowing stories related to
fiim during his melancholy pilgrimage.
At Greta the Minister was told that 95
per cent, of the inhabitants are on the dole.
In good times they were a hardworking
and thrifty lot, and a large proportion
saved up enough to buy their own homes.
These homes they cannot sell, nor can they
raise any money on them, nor get any kind
of work, even relief work. The local council
was offered a loan, but refused on the
ground that it could see no prospect of
repaying the money, an attitude rather stag-
gering to a politician trained in the boom-
borrow-and-burst school. He rallied, how-
ever, and promised that some work should
be found for the Greta people, a promise
repeated in other townships where councils
have taken the same stand, and where the
miners and their families have suffered
almost as much. At Cessnock and other
places the Minister was informed that thou-
sands of men had had no work for years,
that thousands of youths approaching man-
hood had never had a job, that women were
without linen and bedclothes, that children
had been withdrawn from studies for which
they had shown exceptional aptitude be-
cause they could not be properly clad. All
this undeserved misery has been bravely,
proudly borne.
On the other ■ side of the continent a
Royal Commission has been giving an
account of the situation on the second-rate
Collie coalfield. It reports that because
“successive Ministers have yielded to pres-
sure exerted by the coalminers’ union against
the most definite advice of the Commis-
sioner and his officers, soft coal has been
forced on the Railway Department,” and
the miners and mineowners, who had a
friendly understanding, have been on a
wonderful wicket for years:—
Declared profits of Amalgamated Collieries for 12
years to June 30, 1932, averaged 15.3 p.c. p.a. on
£250,000. Actual profits have been at least 24.4
p.c. p.a. on £lBO,OOO.
Mr. Walter Johnson has absolute control of
Amalgamated Collieries, Occidental Insurance and the
Collie Power Co. In 12 years, at least £BO,OOO
more than was necessary to command all legitimate
services of general management and for bunker sales
was paid to Messrs. Johnson and Lynn. In addi-
tion to net remuneration of about £93,000', Johnson
and Lynn have received over £20,000 for expenses.
During the 12 years consumers of Amalgamated
Collieries coal have paid in excess of all fair
profits and costs £312,000 in profits on real capital
invested, £BO,OOO for administration, £12,000 for
insurance, and £27,000 to the Collie Power Co., a
total of £431,000 —equal to Is. 9d. per ton of coal.
In 11 years the Railway Department purchased
3,014,080 tons of coal and paid £828,800 too much
for it; the East Perth power station paid £253,300
too much.
From the Hibble (Commonwealth) award of
September, 1920, to the Walsh (State) award of
October, 1931, rates of pay at Collie averaged 73
p.c. more than those of the Kalgoorlie gold workers.
Since the Walsh award the excess has been 30 p.c.
For 11 years prior to the Walsh award, owners and
workers together received ss. 6d. too much for every
ton of coal produced.
The position is not quite the same as it
was in N. S. Wales, but it isn’t very differ-
ent. “Why quarrel between yourselves?”
Billy Hughes asked owners and miners in
effect when trouble threatened over coal
in the early days of the war. “There is the
melon, divide it between you”—the melon
being the public. The plan gave simply
wonderful results, so long as the public had
no alternative. But the public eagerly
sought alternatives; oil or other power
was substituted wherever possible, and to-
day N. S. Wales has lost its once great coal
export trade almost completely. In 1924
the output of N.S.W. coal was 11,618,216
tons; in 1932, according to preliminary
figures, it was 6,432,362 tons. The shocking
things which Dunningham discovered on the
Northern field are the natural consequence.
He might find even worse on the other
fields.
This civilisation of ours is a complicated
business. Billy Hughes looked like a fine
friend of the miner when he made the great
lift of earnings possible 18 years ago; actu-
ally, nobody ever did a worse thing for the
industry or the men engaged in it. And
sooner or later the same verdict will have
to be entered against those who have been
responsible for cutting up the melon in the
West.

Real Education.
Dear Bulletin, —Few practising teachers
will endorse Mr. Osborne’s eulogy of the
revision of the elementary-school curri-
culum in Victoria (B. 25/l/’33). In true
inspectorial vein Mr. Osborne regrets that
“many Australian teachers fail to achieve
greatness because they do not realise their
true objective—they concentrate on the
teaching of subjects” and consider them-
selves successful “if the child at the right
moment is able to reproduce the facts.” Are
not Mr. Osborne’s colleagues, the inspectors,
solely to blame for this? In Victoria
primary-school examinations have been
always under the sole control of the in-
spectors.
The inspector is still an inquisitor of
teachers’ work, in whose hands lies the in-
spected’s career. Too often the inspector
—who may be one of the latest appointed
—judges teachers by results in examina-
tions; more often, having concentrated at
the Teachers’ College or at the University
upon one feature in education, he preaches
this to the detriment of all else. The
scheming teacher plays up to the faddist—
and secures promotion. The real teacher,
the educator, ignores the fad—and is slain
for his “lack of enthusiasm” or for his
“poor results.” Despite Mr. Osborne’s plati-
tudinising on reality, Victorian education
will never be “real” until its teachers are
real teachers and not mere echoes of the
administration.
Victorian inspectors need a changed out-
look more than the teachers. Hitherto the
inspectors have never been noted as edu-
cational reformers. Mr. Osborne sneers
at “mass-teaching methods”; but no in-
spector has ever yet had the courage to
refuse point-blank to allow a teacher to be
saddled with a class of 80 youngsters. The
inspectors have done nothing to help along
the vitally necessary reformation of our
post-primary system, possibly because they
fear that as primary inspectors they may
lose a little of their prestige if all children
above 12 were given a modern post-primary
education. Even revision of the elementary-
school curriculum was forced on them by
the brilliant advocacy of Geo. Browne, vice-
principal of the Teachers’ College.
“Reality” in education is very necessary.
But until Victorian teachers are entirely
freed from the ingrained fear of the in-
spector, until all inspectors make them-
selves, like the late Aubrey Russell, the
teachers’ friends and supporters, and until
teachers can feel that their department is
really their support, and that they are not
there simply as subjects for bureaucratic
pin-pricking, all the curriculum revision in
the world will not make Victorian education
one iota more effective. A fearless, broad-
minded teacher teaching 10-year-old young-
sters Icelandic would lay firmer and surer
foundations for his pupils’ adult life than a
typical inspector-ridden Victorian teacher
teaching all of Mr. Osborne’s revised curri-
culum. “The teacher’s the thing”—not the
curriculum. The remedy lies with Mr.
Osborne and his inspectorial colleagues.—
Yours, W. Cremor (past-president of the
Victorian Teachers’ Union).

It was coolly suggested to the Canadian
Government the other day that the swap-
ping of Russian oil for Canadian cattle, of
which so much has been heard, could be
arranged if the Government guaranteed pay-
ment of 4,000,000 dollars represented by
7 p.c. Russian bonds. The reply was to the
effect that the Government would see the
Soviet in Sheol before it would put its name
to a Russian p.n. for a dollar. Russia has
been trying to get money in Wall-street, offer-
ing 10 p.c.j the smallest donation thankfully
received ; but there are no takers. The way
of the defaulter is hard, as Lang found last
year, though the experience seems to have
been wasted on him.
Surrounded by the usual flock of profes-
sors, the Loan Council met in Melbourne
last week and suggested biting the Common-
wealth Bank Board’s ear for £6,000,000, “to
enable the remainder of the 1932-33 loan-
works programme to be financed.” The
board drew its attention to the fact that the
floating debt had reached £86,000,000. After
chewing this over, the Premiers found they
could get along with £4,000,000, and agreed
to go on the market for what they want next
year; and so it was arranged. Premier
Stevens gleefully reports that his Govern-
ment will have spent £7,000,000 on loan
works for the year “as against a credit of
only £4,000,000 during the period of our
predecessors”; but this is nothing to be
thankful for. Borrowing got us into the
worst of this mess, and can’t possibly get us
out of it, though courageous reduction of
taxes and public expenditure may.
More thousand-pounders for the public
service ! Lang’s Conciliation Commissioner
was retired on the ground that there was
nothing for him t.o do; but Stevens has
appointed a successor, also from the Trades
Hall, at £lOOO a year. The gentleman is
to have an Apprenticeship Commissioner to
keep him company. Simultaneously, Can-
berra reports that “a new office has been
created in the Federal Attorney-General’s
department, that of second assistant secre-
tary and second assistant Parliamentary
draughtsman; the salary ranges from £950
to £llOO a year.” Presumably the wickedly
overburdened taxpayer is expected to be
grateful.
Germany is to have another appeal to the
distracted people (it will be the fourth in
12 months), with the Nazis controlling the
electoral machinery. Hitler is Chancellor.
That is to say, he has been named Chancel-
lor, but a Sydney “Herald” portrait of him
would pass for one of Eric Campbell, of
the New Guard. Eric is in Europe, or
could be there by this time. He called at
Fremantle about the middle of last month,
A DOLF: “Eric, mein friendt, you've gome
shust in time . Ve’ve six million Gom-
munists in Shairmany. Go und, hit
every vun of der on der nose.”
bringing the news that the New Guard had
become an international organisation and had
250,000 members in N. S. Wales alone.
Strange that his descent on the Old World
should coincide with the sudden elevation of
Hitler, whom Hindenburg hated like poison—
if it is Hitler.
Lang’s newspaper gleefully reports that
“when the next Federal election is held
invalid and old-age pensioners will
prise a solid block vote for Labor. It
adds that the Federal Langsters have
“organised tlie pensioners into strong bodies,”
and quotes Beasley, their group leader, as
saying that “Labor could win a Federal
election on the pensions issue alone.” At
the beginning 0 f the month there were
177,462 old-age pensioners and 72,143 in-
valid pensioners. Altogether, they represent
about 8 p.c. of the voters at a Federal elec-
tion. It is utterly disgraceful, though char-
acteristic, to “organise” them so that a poli-
tical gang may purchase office with promises
which can never be fulfilled; but it will be
a pity if the country should be driven to
protect itself.
Honest old Jack Barnes told the A.W.U.
convention why the Scullin Government, of
which he was a member, had to reduce old-
age and invalid pensions :
When Labor came into power there was no money,
and we could not borrow any. In 1931 we were
faced with the position that we could have paid
pensions to the middle of July of only 12s. per
week. After that, not a bean! That forced upon
the Government something' that was very distasteful,
and it was done, not because we liked doing it, but
to save the people from a worse fate.
The “worse fate” will arrive if the Friends
of the Pensioners who are “organising” them
and promising them a pound a week gain
power by such means and “socialise credit”
—seize control of the banks and the note
issue.
“Hey! What are you doing in that rig-out ?

The parcel of union secretaries who ex-
pelled Premier Hogan and some of his Minis-
ters had things all their own way at the Vic.
A.L.P. conference. By resolution of that
body no “leader of the State Parliamentary
Labor party” will in future be “permitted to
accept a commission to form a Government
unless he has a Labor majority in the Leg.
Assembly.” There has never been a Labor
majority in the Leg. Assembly, so if the
party had been thus shackled since it began,
forty-odd years ago, there would never have
been a Yic. Labor Government. If the
Federal A.L.P. had had a similar rule from
the beginning, there would have been no
Watson Ministry in 1903 and no Fisher
Ministry in 1908, nor perhaps any Labor
Government at all. For the people would
have been chary of placing their destinies in
the hands of meek serfs of a machine—
poor creatures without administrative experi-
ence or the sense of responsibility which it
brings.
Though Blackburn and Slater, the two Par-
liamentary lawyers, fought hard at the Yic.
A.L.P. conference to have Harry Bailey re-
admitted as a member, the majority insisted
upon keeping bim “excluded.” Bailey followed
his leader, Hogan, on the Premiers’ Plan issue
at the general election in May; at one fell
swoop he lost his Ministership, bis Asse.mbly
seat (Warrnamb.ool) and his A.L.P. ticket.
He can appeal to the Federal executive and
Federal conference if he thinks fit, but per-
haps he has had enough of being persecuted
by intolerant pigmies.
There have been ominous complaints in
Queensland where “comrades” congregate
that Forgan Smith hobnobs too much with
Governors and other pillars of an effete capi-
talism. By way of showing that he is still
sound at heart, Foggy declined an invitation
to a Commonwealth Government dinner i»
Melbourne, at which bankers, as well as
Tories, were to be present. About the same
time be projected a torrent of words at
Latham, the Commonwealth Attorney-
General, because that coldly efficient person
gazetted a regulation frustrating the Foggy
Government’s plans for taking control, of
wharf labor at Brisbane and giving the
Waterside Workers’ Federation a monopoly
withdrawn from it by the Commonwealth
Arbitration Court. “We have a mandate
from the people of Queensland to carry out
Labor policy,” said Foggy, striking a Lang-
like attitude, “and we will use all the re-
sources at our disposal to give effect to that
mandate.” It is now hoped that the “com-
rades” will stop growling.
Some Queensland Laborites would like to
depose Foggy Smith and set up Bruce, Minis-
ter of Works and member for The Table-
land. Wliat Bruce has to offer that Foggy
cannot supply is by no means clear. Most
probably the storm that is brewing for the
Government would fall just as relentlessly
on Bruce as it will on Foggy.
Bike thousands of other devoted ladies,
Miss Beatrice Taylor has rendered good
service as a Government school-teacher, and
N.S.W. people who have no sympathy with
Reds would have been sorry if her pilgrimage
to Russia and her lectures on the marvels
alleged to have been accomplished in that
country had ended in her getting the sack.
This has not happened—the Public Service
Board found the charge of wilful disobedi-
ence not proven—and the lady is reported
to have said she was sure it would not
happen. Then it is strange, that she did not
snub her noisy Communist sympathisers and
repudiate the school-children’s strike they
tried to work up. That idiotic business
proved a dud, as it deserved to be.
Queensland employers are applying for a
reduction of the State basic wage from £l5
14s. a week to £3 Os. lOd. Queensland trade-
unions are urging the Forgan Smith Gov-
ernment to usher in a 36-hour working week
with no reduction of pay. It is suggested
that the sugar industry will be the first to
have the 36-hour week thrust on it. If so,
there will be an immediate demand for further
concessions from the southern interests which
forced the recent reduction of the retail
price of sugar. Queenslanders should be
pulling together these doubtful days, instead
of fighting one another.
The word “rob” is even more grossly mis-
used than the word “invest” (as applied
to gambling operations) in the journalism
of the day. Poor old N. S. Wales, which
went £13,253,000 to the bad last year, and
is spending at the rate of £9,000,000 a year
on social services, borrowing most of it, is
trying to save a trifle on its non-contribu-
tory scheme of widows’ pensions, which, when
wool was Is. 6d. a pound and wheat ss. a
bushel, were fixed at £1 a week. This has
been described as “robbing the widows and
their children” (who got 10s. a week) “of
per cent, of their pensions”; and one
indignant commentator adds that “the
Stevens Government did it like a thief in
the night.” The Vic. Government reported
that the number of persons receiving un-
employed-relief had decreased from 47,098 in
.Tune to 23,482 in December. Straightway
it was accused of having “robbed 23,616 of
the dole.” How can people be robbed of
what they do not possess and can neither
sell nor sue for?
Following the example of the Clerks’
Union, the Brisbane branch of the Water-
side Workers’ Federation has thrown out
all its old officials with a thud that could
be heard from the Tweed to Thirsty Island.
The first ballot was declared invalid, and a
second was held. All the new officials are
actual working members of the Federation.
Of course, Thomas, the Dominions Secre-
tary, must go and poke his nose into the
cricket wrangle. This foolish Minister helped
to put De Valera in by allowing it to be
said that he had referred gleefully at Ottawa
to the prospect of civil war in the Free
State (he denied it, but too tardily for his
denial to carry any weight) ; now, by receiv-
ing members of the M.C.C. at the Dominions
offi.ee, and countenancing an appeal from his
“And here, my son, take a few K.C.M.G.’s
and C.B.E.’s and things, and see if you
can do anything with them.”
subordinate in Australia to the Board of
Control, he has made it look as if the board
had some warrant for its idiotic assertion
that “body-line bowling is likely to upset
the friendly relations existing between Aus-
tralia and England.” Obviously Britain
needs a new Dominions Secretary, just as
Australia needs a new Board of Control.
Jimmy Stopford, the Queensland Minister
for Mines, was busy at an annual meeting
of the A.L.P. when a mass meeting of rail-
waymen wli.o were discussing the abolished
superannuation scheme demanded his attend-
ance at their show. Stopford told the mes-
sengers he couldn’t be in two places at once.
When this statement of the obvious did not
impress them, he said they could go back
to their meeting and tell it to go to Gehenna.
The railwaymen are pressing for the return
of what they paid into their superannua-
tion fund. To mention this just now to
members of the Forgan Smith Ministry is
enough to make even the mildest of them
hit up 50,000 revolutions to the minute.
S.A. PREMIER HILL: “Ah, well, thank you,
gentlemen, for the mat.”
The choice of Hitler as Chancellor sug-
gests that Hindenbufg has done what the
electors of Southern Ireland did to De
Valera—handed him a nice long rope in the
hope that he will put it to the best possible
use. The difference seems. to be that Hin-
denburg has acted with his eyes open, and
Ireland has betted on the blind.
One of Lang’s clumsy performances when
Premier was a measure making £5OO p.a.
the maximum salary payable by the N.S.W.
Government. He wasn’t serious, but some
of his more or less dutiful followers thought
or choose to think he was; anyway, he is
to be embarrassingly reminded of the stupid
stunt. The Concord branch of his organisa-
tion is to propose at a Trades Hall confer-
ence, to which Lang has been bidden, that
“members of Parliament and all holders of
or candidates for a paid office within the
party” should be compelled “to sign a pledge
agreeing to pay unreservedly into party
funds all income received in excess of £3OO
a year.” Another branch asks for a ukase
commanding “members of the next Labor
Government” to “pool their salaries, devot-
ing 40 per cent, to the furtherance of the
socialist objective and equally dividing the
remainder among themselves.”
North Queensland has become a happy
hunting ground for Communist agents, who
stir up all the trouble possible. Of recent
months they have concentrated on relief
workers; now they are infesting the cane
districts and giving an ugly twist to the
British preference question, already diffi-
cult enough. As the majority of these
nuisances are foreigners, some of them hardly
able to speak more than a few words of
English, Commonwealth action is called for.
Deportation of the most noxious pests would
do a world of good.
Allegedly as a protest against the con-
tinued failure of the Commonwealth authori-
ties to provide Tasmania with a wireless ser-
vice approximating to that enjoyed by all
the mainland States (barring, perhaps,
Westralia), the Speck’s Listeners’ League
has resolved to ask its members to refrain
from renewing their licenses. Though it is
reported that one or two loyal leaguers have
already complied with the request, nobody
expects the rush of cancellations (and con-
sequent loss of revenue) will be such as to
fill Treasurer Lyons with alarm or to be-
cloud the Cymric hopefulness of the A.B.C.
Pressure has again been brought to bear
on the Indian Government to approve of
legislation permitting Hindus of low caste
or no caste at all to enter temples and enjoy
other privileges from which they have
hitherto been debarred. The Viceroy refuses,
and refusal is forced upon him. When the
British took over from the East India Com-
pany, rigid undertakings were given that
there should be no interference with re-
ligions. Any departure from this undertak-
ing would necessitate a complete revision of
what is, to all intents and purposes, the Con-
stitution of the Indian Empire.

Lake Victoria, near Sliepparton (Vic.). A
young man was out with a girl in a canoe
when they saw a wire attached to an elec-

They went ashore, and the girl swung herself
out on the wire. She got safely back, but when
the youth essayed the feat he found himself
unable to let go. He was taken out of the
water dead. It was at first assumed that he
had been drowned and the doctors applied the
appropriate remedies for two hours. At the
inquest, however, it turned out that
swimmers had amused themselves for a
long time by swinging on the wire, the slight
electric shocks they got apparently being-
regarded as an added zest. Instruction in

ienced to terms of imprisonment totalling
360 years. “Of course, several of them were

pired that the much-sentenced one had been

the little green is bounded on three sides by

Judge and a K.C. (the fourth side faces the
harbor) an inordinate number of rules, regu-
lations, ordinances and the like are habitu-
ally broken there. “Private Beach. Tres-
passers will be Prosecuted,” says a notice;
and the place is a miniature Bondi on fine
holidays. “No Dogs Allowed in this Park
Except under Control,” says another notice ;
and it teems with seemingly ownerless mon-
grels. Ball games are forbidden ; and cricket
and football are regularly played, according
to the season, while golfers do approach
shots into gardens and occasional full-blooded
drives into the harbor. One regulation alone
is rigidly obeyed: “Do Not Interfere with

as a corruption of an alleged abo. word
“borak,” though what the unsophisticated
native knew of barracking in its present
sense is not altogether clear. Another view,
pressed with a deal of positiveness by a
recent disputant, is that the word was first
coined in Melbourne owing to the proficiency
at roaring encouragement and howling abuse
displayed by the supporters of a football
team that had its habitat near some artil-
lery barracks of the period. This sounds
more probable, though for that matter there
are barracks and Barrack streets in most
Australian capitals. The assertion is also

“M.0.P.”: The periodical story of Japan-

waters has cropped
up in the papers. So
has the dark suspi-
cion that the vessels
alleged to have been
seen were really sur-
veying the Barrier
Reef passages.
Marine surveying is
a long and intricate
business, and all that
a furtive collection
of small craft could
do in this connec-
tion -would be of
little practical use.
As to illicit shelling,
it has been practised
ever since the Jap-
anese occupied the
Marshalls. They are
after trochus .shell,
not pearl, and they
are occasion-
ally caught, as was
the case in New
Guinea waters last
year. The Japs are
uot the only ones.
In the past Dutch
poachers from the
Indies are known to have frequently raided
Australian waters, pearl-shell being' their
objective.

“Feng-Shui”-: The German Pacific islands,
over which Japan has the mandate which it
says it won’t give up even if it leaves the
League, contain about 50,000 inhabitants of
Malay origin, and IS,OOO Japanese, who,
according to some ethnologists, are also of
Malay origin, crossed by Mongol elements.
One of the islands, Ponape, has monolithic
vestiges of an ancient civilisation in a city
in the sea larger than ancient Rome, a sort
of Asiatic Venice with water streets. The
builders are said to have come from Central
Asia via Japan by stepping-stones that have
since disappeared. They were driven out of
their continental home by the desiccation of
their pastures and they vanished from their
island stopping-place through the opposite
cause, too much water, which submerged
their homes. Prof. Macmillan Brown, of
Maoriland, estimates that a population of
several millions would have been required to
quarry out and convey the gigantic stones of
which the walls of their city were composed,
though the island on which it was built is
not large enough even to grow the food of
the army of builders, whoever they were.
So one is forced to postulate a vast archi-
pelago as large as the Dutch East Indies and
as thickly populated, which has sunk beneath
the waves. Such subsidences still occur in
the Pacific on a small scale, such as a mis-
sionary reported when he went recently to
revisit an island and found it wasn’t there.
If the subsidence was gradual it must have

remaining specks of land and wholesale mass-
acres of the residents unable to defend them-
selves. It is a pity there is no historical
record of an occurrence which must have
rivalled the Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire; but if there had been any Ponape
Gibbon lie would have had no paper to write
his impressions on.

“Mells”: Arnold Bennett and John Gals-
worthy, perhaps the two most notable Eng-
lish novelists of this generation, were born
in the same year (1867), and died within
12 months of one another. Both were
trained for the law, Bennett in a country
solicitor’s office, Galsworthy at Oxford and
the Inner Temple; neither ever practised.
Bennett’s first book was published in 1898,
Galsworthy’s in 1901. The latter’s death
recalls that he visited Australia when he
was a young man in the course of a lengthy
and leisurely world’s tour, and that the
sailing-ship Torrens, bound from Adelaide
to Durban in 1893, carried two men who
were destined to make great names in litera-
ture —Joseph Conrad, first mate of the wind-
jammer, was the other. Conrad the Pole,
who was 10 years Galsworthy’s senior, and
who died half a dozen years ago, was the
first to become famous.

“Oxmead” : The town of Gladstone (S.A.)
is to keep its 50 th birthday (or birth-
week) in March. Every other Australian
State, and Maoriland as 'well, has a Glad-
stone on its map, but this one seems to
have a better right to the title than any
of the others, for it is on record that the
founders wrote to the British Prime Min-
ister in 1872 asking for permission to name
the town after him and received a courteous
assent. Also the present Lord Gladstone
has maintained the connection by present-
ing the town with a portrait of the G.0.M.,
and is about to present it with a bust.
These numerous Gladstones, however, are a
vexation to the postal authorities, and a
few years ago the Queensland. Government,
which claims to have an older if not as
well-credentialled a Gladstone as S. Aus.
possesses, suggested that it was up to the
southern State to find a new name for this
particular spot of earth. An Adelaide Pre-
mier countered with the suggestion that the
Queensland Gladstone should be rechrist-
ened Ilawarden —but this hasn’t been done
yet. Queensland would seem to be open to
reason in these matters; a good many years
ago it changed the name of a northern sea-
port from Geraldton to Innisfail because there
was a more important Geraldton in Westralia.

“Hotliam”: Melbourne is mildly exercised
over the discovery that its coat of arms is
illegal as well as being shockingly bad
heraldry. The arms were assumed by the
corporation itself immediately after the city
was founded. The granting of arms is a
Royal prerogative exercised by the College
of Arms. This august body was never con-
sulted in the matter, and. what is worse,
the necessary fees, amounting to about £l5O
at par, have never lieen paid. Still, Mel-
bourne has sinned in good company. The
City of London is in the same box.
A FORGOTTEN PIONEER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“At a meeting of the Royal Life Saving Society
in Sydney it was recalled that the first man who
donned a costume at Manly, some 30 years. ago,
and plunged into the surf was arrested and fined
£2 and costs at the Water Police Court. He stub-
bornly repeated his offence the next day and the
Elizabethan statute under which he was prosecuted
soon became a dead letter. The pioneer’s name is
variously given as Gocher and Goucher.”
Honor to them, the sturdy pioneers,
The chaps who blazed the track, whate’er
their spheres!
Nor picture all of them those doughty bands
Who fought their way into untraversed
lands,
Beat back the bush and carved through
storm and stress
Homes in what erst was frowning - wilder-
ness,
Or burst undaunted into silent seas,
Like Dampier, Flinders, Cook and such as
these.
Remember there were lots of humbler souls,
Whose names are not enshrined in history’s
rolls,
That broke the barriers and paved the way
To half the liberties wo prize to-day.
Sheiks of the surf and sirens of the shore,
Perpend on what lie did for you of yore,
And give a cheer belated for your voucher
Of all you owe to Gocher —or to Goucher.
History was made at storied Runnymede,
1 think it’s universally agreed,
When barons forced tyrannic John to sign
The Magna Charta on the dotted line;
When Tyler settled, in a moment rash,
An interfering tax-collector’s hash;
When Hampden, with determination grim,
Declared they’d get no ship-money from him.
’Twas made when Kosciusko fighting fell
And Pickwick went to quod on principle.
And when by sea-girt Manly’s pine-fringed
tide,
The first of bathers manfully defied
Outworn conventions, also man-made laws,
Be sure that watching Freedom shrieked—
applause!
You lusty cavaliers and sun-tanned braves
Who pay some surf queen homage by the
waves,
Bethink in garb like that you’d scarce
approach her
Had it not been for Goucher—or for Gocher.
Picture the scene! Into the surf he hops
Oblivious alike of laws and cops.
Haled to the seat of judgment, coldly chid
For his offence and fined a cuppler quid,
He never turns a hair but makes a mock
Of some pretentious Shallow from the dock;
Threatens to do it again, amid a buzz
Of admiration for his nerve —and does.
Till the Law wearies of a losing game
And a new generation lauds his name,
Or possibly omits such meed because
It’s still a bit uncertain what it was.
O for a pageant in this spacious age!
Think what a pastoral play ’twould be to
stage,
On Mrs. Grundy and the way to quash her,
As pioneered by Goucher —or by Gocher!

T. THE R.


“Ax-beep” : There are a number of dodges
for keeping a railway carriage to yourself.
One commercial I knew used to screen the
windows and yowl like a baby when the
train was at a station ; he became quite an
adept at imitating a scolding mother and
an outburst of lusty bawling whenever any-
one approached the door. Another had a
supply of “Engaged” labels stolen from some
station, but that was a risky business. The
trump card was played by a gentleman of
the road who cari-ied a little case contain-
ing a packet of prawn-heads and scales and
half a dozen empty beer bottles. Selecting
an empty cOinpartment, he would scatter
these about the floor and the cushions, and
settle down comfortably for the night, snug
in the knowledge that this mute evidence

he was joined by a genuine drunk hiccup-

“C'owles”: It isn’t only at Melbourne that
huge pieces of statuary and other weighty
objets d’art are liable to disappear mysteri-
ously. Last August some unknown and
acquisitively-disposed persons removed from
Sydney’s Garden Island, where it stood be-
side the door of the main official building,
no less valuable a souvenir than the
bell of the Emden. Nobody knows
how the nefarious business was man-
aged, for it would take a strong man
to lift this massive curio, or what the thieves
proposed to do with it; and nobody knew
where a search for the stolen goods might
be instituted' with any chance of success
until last week, when in consequence of “cer-
tain information” —almost as mysterious as
the theft itself—a party of naval officers and
detectives got on the trail of the bell. It
hadn’t travelled far, having merely been
conveyed across to the Domain and buried
a foot or two deep. There are all sorts of
theories about the motive, but it seems cer-
tain that the bell could only have been re-
moved by someone with an inside knowledge
of Garden Island.

“Ben Gunn”: All the hidden treasure isn’t
in buccaneers’ West Indian haunts ; accord-
ing to the Westralian “Mirror” an ex-
pedition is being organised to prospect
for a rich cache believed to have been
planted somewhere near the coast within
150 miles of Perth, over a century
before Captain Cook landed at Botany Bay.
Interest in the doings of the old Dutch navi-
gators was revived a couple of years ago when
a crumbling skeleton was found near the
mouth of the Moore River, and valu-
able old coins, bearing early seventeenth-
century dates, were happened on half a mile
away. Then a veteran Westralian, Alfred
Burt (a scion of one of the celebrated
Six Families), recalled that in 1875 he was
with a marine survey party that came upon
a curious circle of stones near the old coast
road from Perth to Geraldton, apparently
placed there by some inexplicable human
agency. Attempts are now being made to
link up that landmark (as it obviously was)
with the first disastrous wreck in Australia
of which history has any record. These are
the details briefly summarised: —
In 1649 the Vergulde Draeck (Gilt Dragon), laden
with rich merchandise and 78,000 guilders in money,
was wrecked in lat. 30.40 and 118 lives were lost.
Seven of the survivors managed to reach Batavia,
leaving 68 behind to protect the cargo and! treasure.
Several ships were dispatched to search for the
castaways during the next few years, but no trace
of them or the treasure was ever found.
The approximate site of the circle of stones
is placed about 60 miles north of where the
Gilt Dragon came to grief, but, of course,
the Dutchmen may have moved northward,
and the suggestion is that they buried their
treasure here and marked the place in the
best' way that occurred to them before they
perished of starvation or were exterminated
by the natives. There are vague stories of
other people besides Burt having seen and
been intrigued by this mysterious ring of
stones, but the coast is a wild and desolate
one, with almost impenetrable thickets and
incessantly shifting sandhills, and nobody
has managed to locate it of recent years.
* * * *
“Kerberos”: The announcement that the
monastery of St. Bernard is sending a band
of monks to Tibet to found a hospice with
St. Bernard dogs at a spot 12,000 ft. above
sea level reminds one that these tykes, like
the Alsatians, were originally sheep dogs,
and acquired their rescuing proclivities from
hunting for snowed-up sheep and lambs.
One notes that the breed is now popular, in
Britain, having been introduced, according
to a London journal, by Lloyd George, who
brought one back from a Geneva Peace Con-
ference. This is tosh. In the 1880’s the
giant dogs were the rage in England, as
anyone who can recall George du Maurier’s
magnificent drawings of them in London
“Punch” can testify.

“Kerys” : Mrs. Binks arrived at my back
door in a state of fearful agitation. She asked
me to telephone for the police and, pending
their arrival, to enlist the services of Mr.
Cash, the corner grocer. It appeared that
sh e had been
hanging out the
clothes when she
suddenly noticed
a suspicious-look-
ing stranger en-
tering the wash-
house. She dash-
ed up and locked
the door, and, as
the window was
nailed up, count-
ed him securely
held. “H ear
him?” she whis-
pered, as sounds
of yelling were
borne over the
fence. “He’s a
terrible r looking
man—has a face
like a murderer.”
And certainly the
language sounded
unrefined. Forti-
fied by Mr. Cash,
we crept round
to investigate and
found an indivi-
dual who, having
smashed one of
the small panes,
was glaring out
of the window,
purple in the face
and almost be-
yond speech.
That came when
our local con-
stable arrived in
haste, and moved
him to intimate
that a charge of
“language” would
be added to the
original one. In
the midst of
argument an and
general confusion, it presently dawned on
us that it was a case of mistaken identity,
the locked-up one being merely the meter-
reader, who, finding the place open and no-
body at home, had presumed to enter the
wash-house to get a drink of water. The
constable left, looking rather aggrieved. Mrs.
Binks offered the indignant victim a cup of
tea, and I went home to find the pudding
burnt to a cinder.

“Erua” The war altered a lot of business
relationships, sometimes for the better. I
recall a M.L. junior accountant who in his
spare time licked aspiring soldiers into shape.
In 1914 he found his ranks reinforced by
patriotic civilians getting ready for trouble,
among them his own boss, with whom he
had never been on the best of terms. The
boss had a poor opinion of the junior
accountant in office hours, and was unpre-
pared to find himself hustled unceremoni-
ously hither and thither by an efficient young
man in uniform, who acted as if they had
never met before. But he grimly did as he
was ordered, endured insult and sarcasm,
and towards the end of the evening earned
a word of encouragement. When the account-
ant appeared at the office next morning he half
anticipated trouble, if not dismissal, but the
boss made no reference to the night before.
He duly turned up to drill next week, and
when the accountant went off to Gallipoli he
told the young man his job would be there
for him when he got back. The accountant,
minus a foot, to-day runs the business, and
plays a solemn game of bridge once a week
at the boss’s mansion.

“Cauboy”: An interesting assertion of the
principle of nationalism has been made in
Lo.s Angeles, of which Hollywood is the

Murray W. Garson, special assistant to the
U.S. Secretary for Labor, that all foreign
actresses, actors and technicians are under

An effective retort would be for the Govern-
ments of the film-consuming countries to
announce that films not containing a certain

banned from their screens. It savors of hide

is likely to become completely unintelligible

“Mixed” The other evening another un-
fortunate threw himself off Sydney Bridge
just as a water police launch was passing
under it. As the Hops were
taking the shattered body out
of the water, one of them was
nearly brained by the sudden
descent of a pair of heavy
crutches. Investigation
showed that a sympathetic
witness of the tragedy had
rushed to the rescue of the
suicide, but was too late.
The man who went over was
a cripple, and had left his
crutches on the footpath.
Unable to be of any other
assistance, the flurried would-
be rescuer sent his crutches
after him, whether in the
hope that they would support
the owner in the water if he
retained consciousness or on
some other impulse of the
moment is matter for con-
jecture.

“Murkah”: In these days
of trans-ocean radio-tele-
phony there seems to be no
great difficulty in hurling a
voice across Bass Strait to
Tasmania, yet the service
has not been provided. The
reason sounds like a clumsy
attempt at humor —the dis-
tance is not great enough.
If short waves are used their
high angle of diffraction from
the Heaviside layer carries
them too far —they miss the
island ! And if long waves
are used the earth-born wave
(negligible at a distance) is
still strong enough to inter-
fere with the ,ether radiation,
and thereby hopeless distor-
tion is caused. Were Tas-
mania 500 miles nearer the
ice it would have been linked
up with the mainland at least six months
ago. Of course, the battle is still on.

“Strict Yeg.”: An Englishwoman had a
stirring experience as a result of a senti-
mental journey to King Island in Bass
Strait, prompted by a desire to see the spot
where her husband had been wrecked and
washed ashore in his boyhood. With four
others she took passage in a Matthews
amphibian from Hobart. The expedi-
tion made a forced landing on the island
in heavy weather, but got away next morn-
ing for Melbourne. When 25 miles off the
Victorian coast the oil-pressure pipes on two
of the engines broke and the pilot descended
on to a turbulent ocean. Ordering his pas-
sengers into the stern to equalise the weight,
he proceeded to taxi for Apollo Bay, with
less than an even chance of getting there
The coast is grim with beetling cliffs and
no harbors, except those presented by the
few rivulets that debouch into the surf in
widely-separated places. By an extraordinary
coincidence Flight-Lieut. Armstrong, of the
R.A.A.F., happened to be motoring along
the recently-opened Ocean-road, saw the
amphibian and sized up the situation. He
made a rapid survey and guided the voyagers
to a strip of beach 200 yards in length at the
mouth of the Kennett River. The senti-
mental tourist was motored to Melbourne in
time to catch the Sydney express and con-
nect with a Maoriland steamer on which
she had booked a passage. The pilot of
the amphibian was Captain Frank Neale,
one of the most brilliant airmen in Aus-
tralia.

“Ibn el Issar”: Not content with chang-
ing the name of Allah, Kemal Pasha, ruler
of Turkey, has ordered all the Roumi
equivalents of Smith, Jones, etc., to get them
fresh labels. Anyone can choose the name
he prefers, but fancy monnikers are for-
bidden, and in all probability family names
will be those of a person, place or profes-
sion. Children born after the new law comes
into force will take the family name of their
fathers, a thing hitherto unknown in Turkey
unless with the prefix “son of” or some
similar distinguishing title. “Christian”
names will also suffer a change. About the
commonest one in Turkey is Ali. In future
all Alis will be distinguished by an adjec-
tive such as “The Fat Ali,” “The Tall Ali”
or, perchance, “The Leg-theory Ali.”

passing interest in the Indian experiment.

High Court Chief Justice Gavan Duffy
has been granted six months’ leave of
absence. The highest judicial officer in the
Commonwealth is also the oldest in years,
and is unlikely to return to the Bench,
though it is denied that he is retiring. His
Honor was born in Dublin on Feb. 29,1852,
son of a man who was to be Premier of Vic-
toria 20 years later. The old C.J. was called

Brennan and Brercton, Brereton and
Brennan—their names were always coupled.
But the two Sydney poet-professors, who
lived and. worked side by side for years and
died within a few months of one another,
were strangely unlike. Brennan loved life
and good food and good wine; Brereton was
an ascetic —a vegetarian who went hatless
years before the no-hat brigade was born.
Brennan was tall and round and rubicund,
with a great mop of black hair; Brereton
was tall, too, but angular and pallid, with a
bald top above a thin grey thatch. It was
Brereton who once helped to persuade J. F.
Archibald to take a spell in the vegetarian
sanitarium at Wahroonga. Archibald liked
good food, too, and plenty of it. He stood
the diet for a couple of days and then the
menu said .“Vegetable Turkey.” That and
what was served as turkey broke down
Archibald’s resolution. He stayed on; but
he had discovered that you could get a very
good grilled steak at the pub at Pennant
Hills.
For so genial a man John Brereton was
a curiously silent one. Among his landloping
companions in the old days was a well-known
colonel. Once they went off into the moun-
tains from Blacklieath, and for two days did
not know where they were. Then Brereton,
loping ahead, hatless as always, came on a
track. Turning, he said to the colonel
“This’ll do me!” The colonel swears it was
the first word that had been spoken for two
days.
Professor Copland is presented here in an

indeed, and there seems to b<s evidence here
that he has made a satisfactory recovery. A

man; and though Douglas is not very fond

Josiah Thomas’s death cuts off another of
the men who were prominent in those bitter
strikes of the early ’nineties which laid the
foundations of the Labor party. Only one
of them is left in politics—Senator Rae.
He, too, was one of the first to be gaoled.
Josiah Thomas was a mine manager in
charge of the Black Prince, an outside show,
when the big strike of ’92 began at Broken
Hill; and, with a few other heads, ’Siah,
best known at that time as a Methodist local
preacher, took the stump against the owners.
More, he joined the strike committee and
was sent to Queensland to beat up support.
When the long fight was over there was no
job for ’Siah, so he was given the safe Alma
Labor seat in the State Assembly. There-
after he was in Parliament for over 30 years,
winding up as a Nationalist Senator —lie

who died at- his

old cow-farmer, who was known as “Straw-
berry”—not derisively; he had too much
character to be laughed at—was born at
Jamberoo 65 years ago, and had all his life
been associated with dairying. His record of
public service on shire councils and kindred
associations was a lengthy one; it was not
until his sons returned from the war that he
turned his attention to Parliament. In
1920 he contested Byron unsuccessfully, but
a couple of years later the constituency
returned him, and for the last five years he
had represented Lismore. His sound first-
hand knowledge of farming and his strong
personality soon made him a leading figure
in the Country party. He was a firm
chairman, and he would probably have made
a good Minister; but he was never given
the chance.

ralian M.L.C., who happened to be on the
spot and deputised for the State’s regular
representative. Miles was a Nor’-West store-
keeper before he got into Parliament a dozen
or more years ago. and can probably claim
the distinction of being the weightiest man
(physically) in any Australian Legislature.
If he ever played cricket the mildest sort of
body-line bowiing would have more dangers
for him than half a dozen ordinary players.
Ernest T. Crutehley, the representative
of the Imperial Government in Australia,
who has been dragged into-the fierce vortex
of cricket politics by some persons woefully
lacking in a sense of proportion, is a man
who has played many departmental. parts
in his 55 years. He began as an assistant-
surveyor in the Post Office; during the war
he served with the Royal Engineers and in
the Army Postal Service, and he was in the
Ministry of Transport before having a spell
at Dublin Castle on the staff' of the Chief
Secretary for Ireland. He got his Aus-
tralian job a couple of years ago. It doesn’t
appear that he has any special knowledge
of cricket, but he plays a good game of golf,
and writing light verse is another of his
recreations.
Australians crop up in all sorts of places
and callings; according to a cable an Aus-
tralian-born barrister has just succeeded Sir
Chartres Biron as chief magistrate at Bow-
street. This is William Everard Dickson,
a native of Geelong, whose father is
now a resident of S. Aus. The Bow-street
job is one of the plums of the Loudon magis-
tracy, carrying a salary of fISOO. The new
magistrate is a barrister of Gi*ay’s Inn, and
won a captaincy and the M.C. in the war
while serving with a machine-gun section.
He is a nephew and godson of Bill Everard,
Chairman of Committees of Vic. Assembly.
The first priest to become a sky pilot in the
literal sense of the term is Father B. Ryan.
He quajified for his “A” license at the Bal-
larat Aero Club during a three weeks’ holi-
day in the Golden City.
Fifty years ago a youth from Orange
(N.S.W.) dropped into the old Bulletin
office at the bottom of Pitt-street and asked
for a job. Overseer Ifenton told him to take
off his coat and make a start. His name was
Tom Reynolds, and he hasn’t missed the pay-
roll since that day in February, 1883, having
become the oldest inhabitant of the compos-
ing-room. Tom has handled the illustrated
blocks in The Bulletin for more than 40
years, and has struggled with the hand-
writing of thousands of contributors without
his natural cheerfulness being in any way
impaired. “It has been a happy time,” he
said simply, in acknowledging a jubilee
present from the staff.
The Agency-General used to be described
as the grave of political reputations, and
many a man has found a London term a
fatal bar to the continuance of a Parlia-
mentary career in his own country. Knight
Hal Colebatch proved a notable exception.
He was little known outside Westralia when
he first went to London in 1923. Return-
ing, he built up a new reputation as a Com-
monwealth Senator who threw himself vigo-
rously into almost every topic of moment,
and never lost a chance of impressing him-
self on the public as well as on his colleagues.
Colebatch, by the way, had two unsuccessful
shots at Parliament before he arrived there
20 years ago. The second election which he
contested was the most strenuous of all.
He and Tommy Bath, an ex-leader of
the Labor party, whose goldfields seat had
been wiped out, fought for the votes of the
largely agricultural population in the newly-
created Avon seat. Bath just won.
A great miner was'Henry Jones, just dead
in Adelaide at 82. Coal was the magnet
which brought the young Welshman to
Maryborough (Q.), but he turned to gold
when Gympie was discovered, and managed
the Phoenix there. Moving to Westralia, he
was manager of Devon Consols and one or
two other Golden Mile shows. Later he
tried some disappointing S. Aus. claims at
Waukaringa, Tarcoola and Birdwood, and
ended with 15 years as Inspector of Mines
for that State.
S.A.’s ’new watchdog, the Chamber of
Building Industries, has chosen as its first
president P. R. Claridge, who is still on the
right side of 50. He has already been pre-
sident of the Institute of Architects, both
for his own State and for all Australia.
A Gawler-place pile of offices, Claridge
House, is his chief monumfent at present.
Of course when an hon. member ot the
N.S.W. Parliament is in i doubt he can
consult the Clerk or even Mr. Speaker, or (if
he is in the Council) the learned Professor
Peden may come down from the President’s
perch to throw light into dark places ; but
there are many members who would advise
“OLD DARB.”
you, for a start, anyway, to “ask Old Darb.”
“Old Darb’s” other name is Frank Darby,
and he has been for nearly 33 years on the
staff, latterly in the library, fie was a ser-
geant-major in the Boer War, and managed
to get away to the Great War, too.
Alfred William Yeo, the C.P. member for
Castlereagh in the N. S. Wales Assembly, is
one of Mick Bruxner’s new hands. Yeo
came to Macquarie-street last June after un-
seating Joe Clark, one of Lang’s henchmen.
It was Joe who had his watch pinched while
he enjoyed forty winks in the House one
evening. But Castlereagh’s grouch against
him was that he was one of the rural Labor
members who dangled the 7s. 6d.-a-bushel
A. W. YEO, Country party M.L.A. for
Castlereagh (N.S.W.).
wheat-bait whieh so many farmers swal-
lowed in 1930. Yeo is a fine type of out-
back rep. Born near Dunedoo (.N.S.W.),
he has won a living from the soil all his
life. He has a farm at Tooraweenah, near
Gilgandra. Incidentally, the evidence sub-
mitted by him to the Public Works Com-
mittee in favor of a line to that district was
selected as the basis of a test paper in Eng-
lish set for the Shire Clerks’ exam, recently,
which speaks well for his command of the
King’s language.
Walter Wright, the Maoriland artist, who
died the other day at 67, was the younger of
two brothers who were brought there as
children, and in later years devoted their time
to painting the scenery of their adopted land.
Walter Wright’s best-known and largest
canvas, “The Massacre of the Boyd,” a fine
reproduction of a tragic episode in the
Dominion’s early histor*y, is in Auckland Art
Gallery.
Monty Henwood, the new N.S.W. Con-
ciliation Commissioner, was secretary to the
Farriers’ Union in 1908, when Wade’s Indus-
trial Disputes Act gave a start to the
occupation of industrial advocate, Hen-
wood, with Mick Corinington, of the Trolly
and Draymen’s Union, quickly established a
reputation at the Trades Hall as an ex-
ponent of industrial law; his services to his
• own union soon created a demand from
others, and finally he became a straightout
professional advocate. Henwood will fit all
the better into his new job because he is
popular with all sides.
D. M. Dow, Australian Official Secretary
in New York, told some Australia Day ban-
queters about the Premiers’ Plan and recom-
mended a similar plan to the U.S.A. Dow is
a brother of Mrs. Perry, who, as “Johanna,”
conducted The Bulletin’s Melbourne
Chatter brilliantly for many years. She still
wields a freelance pen in Heidelberg (Vic.).
“Davy” in defence :
Dr. Dulng’s claim (B. l/2/’33) that Mr. Roberts
knows more about engine-driving' than cancer •is
ill-chosen, as Mr. Roberts has gone through a five
years’ medical course, although he did not sit for
his final examination. I mention this because, as
a journalist, it was my duty to investigate the
claims of Mr. Roberts. I interviewed many medical
men and many of Mr. Roberts’s patients. My
verdict is that there is strong prirrw. facie evidence
that Mr. Roberts can cure certain forms of cancer,
and the Queensland Government on the evidence has
quite rightly committed him for trial. Dr. Duhig
refused to be a member of the jury because he
decided that it would be unpleasant for him to hear
evidence which might mean that the medical pro-
fession was wrong. All Dr. Duhig succeeds in doing
is to reveal himself a biased critic unwilling to
listen to evidence before convicting a man with
qualifications nearly as good, as his own. Does Dr.
Duhig consider the discoveries of Pasteur unworthy
of consideration because that gentleman was not a
qualified doctor or member of the B.M.A. ? The
B.M.A. endeavored to ridicule Sir Herbert Barker.
It succeeded only in ridiculing itself, and after
killing an honored doctor with the shame it heaped
upon him, it restored his name posthumously to
the register in deference to public opinion. The
Medical Board in Queensland has attempted the
same tactics. I am not arguing in favor of Mr.
Roberts. I do not. say his claim has been estab-
lished but I do say that he is entitled to a fair
hearing.


The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Commonwealth Life (Amalgamated)
Twelve months ago net tangibles were
valued in the books at £72,414 less than the
actuary’s estimate of liabilities under poli-
cies. Capital of this operating co. is fully
paid, but shareholders in the two holding-
cos., Commonwealth Life Assurance Society
and the Citizens and Graziers’, can be called
upon for a further £122,000-odd. Much
depends on what this uncalled capital is
worth.
The actuary recommended that share-
holders immediately fork out £60,660; if
delayed, loss of interest would amount to
£16,577 in five years. The board promptly
made the call, and attempts are now afoot
to oust it for doing so. A Mr. Smith has
been circularising shareholders, and the co.
reports on his activities as follows: —
Regarding the offer mentioned by Mr. Sydney
Smith in his circular, the following extract from
a letter from Mr. VVm. T. Page, Managing Director
of Associated Dominions Assurance Society, Limited,
to your Chairman, dated 11th October, 1932, explains
the position:—
“Mr. Partridge called upon me in July last and
stated that he had called to see me at Mr. Smith’s
request, and stated that Mr. Smith would be pleased
if we could make an offer for the purchase of the
business of the Commonwealth Life (Amalgamated)
Assurances, Limited. After due consideration, I
agreed to meet Mr. Smith in connection with the
matter, after which the offer referred to was made
by this Society.”
The Board is firm in its refusal to have any
dealing directly or indirectly with Mr. Partridge,
late Governing Director of the Federal Life Insurance
Company the unfortunate history of which, coupled
with that of the People’s Prudential Assurance
Company, Limited, is fresh in the minds of S'ydney
people.
Last week Page and .O. E. Corkhill were
charged with publishing a false balance-
sheet of the Associated Dominions, the
society mentioned as having made an offer
for the Commonwealth Life’s business.
The Common wealth Life, like nearly all
post-war life offices, is having a hard fight;
but the present management is doing better
work than any of its predecessors. Since
the co. took over the Commonwealth Life
Society and the ,C. and G.’s business in 1926,
its figures, both Ordinary and Industrial,
have moved as under: —
Excess
Sept., Income. Claims. Exes. Income.
1927.. £114,155 £11,213 £87,361 £15,581
1928.. 125,883 15,065 92,287 18,531
1929.. 133,342 20,340 83,225 29,777
1930.. 131,887 26,978 73,953 30,956
1931 . 120,853 32,853 57,550 30,450
1932.. 106,283 25,632 49,723 30,928
Lapses have been heavy, and interest-reduc-
tion has affected returns from investments;
thus there was a further slip of £14,570
in total income last year, £13,853 of it being
on account of premiums received (£96,038).
But that was partly because of more careful
selection of business. Exes, were reduced
£7827. being equal to 51.8 p.c. of the pre-
miums, as against 52.4, 60.2 and 66.3 p.c.
in the three preceding years. The movement
is encouraging, but the figure is still high.
From the beginning the co. was saddled with
unprofitable short-term endowments; never-
theless claims were reduced £7221. So the
surplus of revenue, available for investment
and the payment of claims, was actually
£478 stronger.
In the Ordinary department, new busi-
ness was much more satisfactory:—
1929. 1931. 1932.

First premiums . . 8,669 3,126 3.477
Renewal premiums . . 36,350 33,355 28,7-09
More whole-of-life and long-term endow-
ment policies were issued. Exes. (£11,568)
took 35.9 p.c. of the year’s premiums, as
against 35.2 p.c. and 45.2 p.c. in the two
preceding years. New business costs
dropped to 182 p.c., compared with 198 and
192 p.c. in 1931 and 1930; that is assuming
that new premiums are 10 times more expen-
sive to gather than old. The figures are
an indication of the management’s efforts
to clean up the position ; provided the good
work is continued further, and shareholders
make up the accumulated actuarial deficit,
the business should be pretty nearly on an
even keel by the next quinquennial valua-
tion. But policy-holders will need to stick
to the co., too ; lapses are mostly dead loss.
New Industrial business written was
£101,070 less at £406,372. Exes, took 59.8
p.c. of the premiums, as against 57.8 and
69.2 p.c. in the two previous years.
Assets are mostly the right stuff :
1927. 1931. 1932.

Loans on mortgages .. 14,152 8,050 7,789

Surplus .. .. £28,398 £37,131 £9.179*
Paid capital .. .. £149,415 £149,921 £149,921
*Excess Life Fund.
Government stocks are so well bought that,
even allowing for the interest cut, they
showed 4.4 p.c. on the mean net tangible
assets last year.
The board, apparently, is not opposed to
amalgamation, but naturally wants any
merger to be in the best interests of policy-
holders and shareholders. Amalgamation
with a concern no worse off than itself
should be a great help to the co., provided
the nolicy of reducing costs was held to
unrelentingly.

In 1981 a reduction in the quantity and
quality of the business offering brought about
an underwriting deficit of £11,132 —unsatis-
factory marine business written in London
was largely to blame. During the past year
the co. withdrew from London; because of
that, and a falling-off in local motor-car in-
surances, there was a slip of £11,164 in
premium income. But it was much more
satisfactory, despite claims which still came
in, and which may come in for some time,
from the long-winded marine business.

The loss ratio was the lightest since the co.
began to write policies direct with the public
seven years ago, when activities spread to
Melbourne and Adelaide. For 17 years before '
that the co. was a reinsurance office for the
Mercantile Mutual. The expense rate was
4.7 p.c. heavier; still, an underwriting
surplus of £2375 showed up. Interest and
rents (£5577, down £l6lß owing to the in-
terest cut) brought total profit up to £7952.
and the 6 p.c. div. was an easy matter, £3752
being carried to reserves —£49,604, equal to
66 p.c. of the year’s not premiums.
In addition, there is £70,000 of paid capi-
tal for policy-holders’ protection, and another
£130,000 at call. The funds are in this

Plagues of locusts in Kenya (East Africa),
where the mills and plantations are, have-
eaten most of the profits during the past two
years. Prices have been low, too. Because
of pests the cane yield on the co.'s planta-
tions dropped from 31.8 to 12.2 tons per acre
during the term (to April, 1932) covered by
the accounts just issued in Melbourne, where
headquarters are, and where most of the
capital is held. The native population, which
consumes most of the co.’s sugar, had its pur-
chasing-power reduced by the ravages of the
locusts on their various crops; thus, though
the co.’s output was greatly reduced, it was
still in excess of local requirements.
The co. shares the local trade with three
or four other mills. The danger of severe
competition appears to have been eliminated
by the formation of East African Sugar Dis-
tributors, Ltd., which markets the finished
product of all the local mills. Though the
actual area harvested last term was greater
than in any previous season, Victoria
Nyanza’s crushing of its own cane dropped
10,983 tons, and farmers’ supplies fell away
21,742 tons: —

Sugar production is not given, but it was
around 3900 tons. After striking off £12,920
for depreciation, only £7lB of profit remained,
and shareholders were again passed over.
They averaged 15.5 p.c. during the five years
to 1930, and, “once the locust cycle is past,
and provided the mills and boiling house are
balanced,” E. G. Mayers, chairman of the
local board and son of the founder, is con-
fident that the co. will pay divs. as in
previous years, even with a further fall of
20 p.c. in the price of the product. It is
a bold but cheering statement in these times.
The new marketing arrangement is re-
flected in a reduction of £61.900 in stocks,
and a drop of £39.492 in the co.’s commit-
ments :

Because of provision for depreciation, the
more or less liquid surplus (£44,163) im-
proved £12,225 during the twelvemonth.
Plant is reported in good working order, but
additional agricultural machinery will soon
be required. On plantation development
£2607 more was spent than was written off.
The co. expects a crushing of 55,000 tons,
mostly from its own plantations, for the
year ‘ which will close on April 30 next.
About 4450 tons of wliite sugar should
result, part of which will have to be ex-
ported ; negotiations have been commenced
with the Sudan Government to supply sugar
at £ls a ton ex mill.
The shares are priced at about 16s. on
the market. Net tangibles amount to 245.,
mostly fixed assets, worth what they can be
made to earn.
Melbourne Electric Supply Cos.
The Victorian Electricity Commission did
not take over the undertaking until Sep-
tember, 1930, though the co.’s franchises ex-
pired in November, 1925. In the interval the
eo. was allowed to continue supplying Mel-
bourne and Geelong with electricity for a
specified return, any profits over and above
that figure being handed over to the Elec-
tricity Commission. Only by drawing on
reserves for £102,848 was the co. able to
pay the customary rates of 8 p.c. to its pref.
and 10 p.c. to its ord. shareholders during
this period of control, but the State was
credited with enough to purchase the under-
taking at its assessed net physical value
(£1,323,552), with about £20,000 in cash to
embellish the gift!
From the co.’s point of view, the deal
was not so satisfactory. The consideration
was received in Commonwealth stock, which
became subject to the 224 p.c. interest cut.
Then the directors became apprehensive
about the fall in Government securities on
’Change. Though some of the furrows have
since been removed from the foreheads of
the board, returns from investments are
still very low —too low to compensate share-
holders for the undertaking they lost, even
allowing for the fall in the cost of living.
The co. is now purely an investment in-
stitution. In April, 1925, an offshoot, the
Melbourne Investment Trust Pty., was re-
gistered. The parent then raised £300,000
of 64 p.c. and 400,000 7 p.c. debenture stock;
this rather expensive money enabled the co.
to invest £673,300 (book value) in the
Investment Pty. This concern passed on
no divs. during the period of control, all
profits being reinvested. But 6 p.c. was
handed out during 1931, and apparently the
same rate was paid last year.
Because of financial emergency legislation
the parent’s total earnings (£103,854)
slipped £15,982. Net profit (£91.038) was
£9443 lighter, and the ord. div.. which
dropped from 10 p.c. to 74 p.c. in 1931. was
further reduced to Oj p.c., the. final being
at the rate of 6| p.c. After paying the
prefs. their 8 p.c., £lOOl was carried to
reserves (£636,931, including £31,511 pre-
mium on the Government stock conversion).
The lay-by was reduced from £1,115.222 in
1929, mainly because the Commission’s
valuation of the undertaking was not equal
to the book figure.
Here are the parent’s balance-sheet figures :
1930. 1931. 1932.

Sundry creditors, £126,820, is the only lia-
bility which is really the co.’s; the Victorian
Government has taken responsibility for the
debentures, hence the contra. But the de-
benture trustees still hold the co. respon-
sible prima facie; and though the co. could
return all its pref. capital (which carries a
premium of 5 p.c.) and all but about Is. 6d.
in the £1 of its ord. stock, leaving the
Investment Pty. intact, the debenture
trustees stand in the way. But a scheme
has been put forward, and it is hoped that,
with the aid of the Vic. Government, the
debenture debt will be discharged, leaving
the co. at liberty to deal with its assets as
shareholders desire. Of the debenture debt
£700,000 is repayable at par in 1935; the
balance may be redeemed by the co. any
time at a premium of 24- to 5 p.c. The co.’s
£1,355,050 of Commonwealth inscribed stock
is repayable in 1935.
The co. owns all the 673,300 £1 shares in
the investment pup, and values the scrip at
par. The pup owes no one except the tax
commissioner; its assets are represented as
follows:
1931. 1932.
Owing by parent .. .. £84,693 £84,693
Inscribed stock . . .. 140,240 141,747

Pref. shares . . .. .. 17,350 4,700
Bank ; deposits . . . . 18,000 -
£873,633 £870.948
Reserves of the pup are thus around
£190,000, and there is some inner strength
in book values. Including the visible lay-by
and, its own reserves, the parent’s £5 prefs.
are covered by £2l ss. in net tangibles; the
. backing for the ord. stock is slightly more
than 40s. in the £l, allowing for the pre-
mium (5 p.c.) at which the pref. capital is
repayable. At £5 10s. pref. holders stand to
lose ss. per share should their capital be
returned, but obtain the high yield of 7.3 p.c.
At 30s. the ords. show a return of 4.3 p.c.
on a 64 p.c. div. basis.

Twelve months ago the N. S. Wales pro-
perty-owner’s position looked hopeless. The
crazy and cruel legislation of the Lang Gov-
ernment culminated in the 10 p.c. levy on
property, which was fortunately squashed by
the Federnl authorities before it could
operate. There had been, undoubtedly, call
lor a moratorium and amendments to the
Landlords and Tenants Act; but under Lang
rule such legislation was used mainly to
strike at the property owner.
Barely eight months had passed between
Lang’s dismissal and the end of the year;
yet in that time there was a definite recov-
ery in property turnovers. But they are
still scarcely a tenth of boom figures, as
this table shows :
■ Property Sales.

1931 . . . . 364,420 484,528
1932 . . . . 660,695 580,782
A large proportion of the city sales repre
.sent the acquisition of premises by firms
previously living in rented properties. The
largest individual transaction was the pur-
chase by Wool worths of the resumed area
on the corner of Pitt and Liverpool streets
for £171,000.
Richardson and Wrench’s figures do not
reflect the recovery, however slight; com-
petition amongst agents was very keen, and
the co.’s gross earnings dropped a further
£2347:
1923 .. £36,250 | 1928 .. £40,488
1924 . . 33,567 1929 . . 36,854

1926 .. 42,795 1931 .. 20,176
1927 . . 41,225 1932 . . 17,829
But exes. (£17,568) were cut £4225; thus
net profit (£261) was an improvement of
£1877 over the previous year’s loss, the
first in the co.’s history. Though share-
holders received divs. right through the
’nineties, they have gone hungry over the
past two years. In 1930 results were equal
to 10 p.c. on capital, compared with 23.9,
31.2, 34.6 and 36.6 p.c. back to 1926.
If advances are of the readily-realisable
nature, practically all the co.’s assets are
liquid:—

The debt (£8046, up £4073) is more than
covered by cash alone.
Future earnings will depend, as past ex-
perience shows, on the tone of the pro-
perty market. Goodwill, the chief asset in
cos. like this, is not taken into account in the
books. The 15s. shares, covered by 16s. lid.
in not tangibles, are at 16s. 6d. on the
market.

Shareholders can thank two things for those
excellent figures. Firstly, the co. has built
up an extensive goodwill oiv the quality of
its products; and secondly, finances have
been kept in good trim by writing down plant
heavily.
The'latter activity shows up in a great
preponderance of liquid assets ; indeed, when
it is considered that £95,802 of the co.’s
assets is represented by Government stock
and bank deposits, the earning power looks
more remarkable still.
After taking stock at £5664 less than a
year ago, gross profit (£42,939) was £1222
more; exes., including taxes and bad debts,
were £Bl2 heavier: thus the net result
(£16,825V was £4lO better. Allowing the
usual £SOOO for depreciation (shown as
written off in the table) enough remained to
pay 12.4 p.c. on capital, compared with 11.9,
11.7, 11.5 and 18.8 p.c. back to 1928. when
boom conditions made trading really lucra-
tive. The div. was kept at a comfortable
10 p.c., though visible reserves are equal to
three-fifths of the capital, and cash is in
excess of trade requirements.
Since 1927 £25,508 has been spent on new
machinery, but all that, and £5492 besides,
has been written off. Other balance-sheet
movements can be seen in this table: —

Stocks are the lowest in the “Wild Cat’s''
records of the co., and they go back to 1900.
The more or less liquid surplus (£135.b93)
was £40,313 in excess of capital when the
books closed.
The visible net tangible backing for the
£4 shares amounts to £6 Bs. The market
appreciates the co.’s strong position, and
pays £7. as against £6 14s. 12 ago.
The return at the present figure is 5.7 p.a.
on a 10 p.c. div. basis.

He could have protected his
old age and his dependents
WE like to paint cheerful pictures of Life Assurance, pictures
showing how it keeps the home going, how it educates children,
and how it makes old age sweet and beautiful. There is no
harm, however,, in occasionally painting the other kind of picture.
Here is a man to whom the depression has brought penury, simply
because he failed to use part of his income in his prosperous years to
ensure against the swing of the pendulum.
How could he have done it? There are many kinds of A.M.P. assurance
that would have saved him. Take policy AE60. Under it a man can
insure his life for, say, £1000. When he reaches 60 years of age, £500
is immediately paid to him. The other £500, plus accumulated bonuses
on that amount, is paid to his dependents on his death. Now, there are
two points to observe in regard to this: One is that a man of 30, in
good health, can have such a £1000 policy by paying a half-yearly
premium of £12/18/9 up till his 60th year, with a reduction to £6/2/6
after his 60th year. The other is that, at any time during the currency
of the policy, he can (should hard times hit him) draw against it, and
keep looking the world squarely in, the eye.
Hadn’t you better find out how little it will cost to start the building
up of such reserves?

averaged less than 1 p.c. p.a., and £BO,BOI had
to be drawn from reserves to pay that and
extinguish losses. Last term, despite poor
demand for frozen beef in the U.K. and on
the Continent, there was a slight recovery
in world meat prices, the movement being
aided by the Ottawa agreement. And
though exports to the East fell off, the co.
recovered its contract with the U. S. Army
in Manila. Thus a profit of £18,409 was
shown, an improvement of £23,705, and a
2J p.c. div. was declared.
Balance-sheet items have' been broken up,
and £99,393 of Consols (par value
£100,280) have been dragged out of hiding
from amongst fixed assetp:—

Also, £192,895 of cash, previously shown
amongst debtors, has been brought to light.
There is thus a surplus of cash and Govern-
ment securities over liabilities amounting to
£269,129, equal to Bs. 2d. per share; it .is
proposed to hand shareholders some of this
as a part repayment of capital, but exactly
how much has not yet been disclosed.
The old Q.M.E., with capital and reserves
of £369,862, was split in two in 1915, capital
mounting to £873,306. The pastoral proper-
ties were passed over to Australian Stock
Breeders, the meatworks at Townsville and
Brisbane being retained by the present co.
The problem at present confronting the in-
dustry is mainly one of high costs (including
long-distance carriage) and low world-
prices. With more and more countries leav-
ing gold, the exchange is not going to mean
all it used to, either.
The scrip is backed by £1 Is. 7d. in net
tangibles—los. 3d of it in fixed assets,
shares, etc., at book value, and the balance
in surplus liquids, which include £84,199 of
book debts. The market prices the shares
at 10s., which shows 5 p.c. if the insecure
2| p.c. div. is maintained.
Associated Dominions Assurance Society
This concern was promoted by William
Thaddeus Page early in 1928, commencing
business on July 1 that year. Page became
managing director, and the co.’s articles pro-
vided that he was not liable to removal from
that office so long as he held 2000 shares.
As consideration for his having arranged
reinsurances with two other concerns (the
A. N. A., Ltd., and the Associated Deposits
Assurance Society, Ltd.), the society agreed
to pay him £20,000 in fully-paids—£62oo in
1928 and the balance in three annual instal-
ments of £4600 each. At June 30 last,
according to the balance-sheet presented as
at that date, total paid capital was £24,009
in 20,007 fully-paid £1 shares and 26,680
shares paid to 3s.
Apart from intangibles (at June 30 last
there was £10,200 represented by purchase
account and £87,724 by establishment
account), the “Wild Cat” has summarised
the co.’s assets and liabilities (apart from
those under policies), as set out in the pub-
lished accounts, as follows :

tOther than under policies.
It is in connection with the 1932 figures
that Page and O. E. Corkhill were charged
last week. The matter is therefore sub judice.
The co.’s figures have expanded rapidly,
partly as a result of absorptions, In 1930
the life business of the Farmers’ and General
Assurance Corp. was bought, and this was
followed in 1931 by the acquisition of the
Australian Benefit Life. In respect of the
year to June last, premium income is shown
at £91,836 and interest at £8208; claims took
£14,312, and exes, ran off with £52,504, equal
to 57.2 p.c. of the year’s premiums, compared
with 59 p.c. in the previous year. There
was thus a surplus of income amounting to
£33,228 (compared with £31,392) ; the life
fund increased to £181,809 and other re-
serves to £22,948. An actuarial valuation
was made during the 1931 term, but the
results have not been broadcast. Assuming
that the assurance funds exactly cover the
liabilities under policies (and that is not at
all certain), then net tangible assets, as
given in the co.’s balance-sheet, were £49,45S
short of the mark when the booksv closed.
There is £22,678 of uncalled capital.
The tin-restriction scheme has now been
in operation for 22 months—present visible
stocks still total 50,000 tons, double the
amount considered necessary. Of this,
21,000 tons is held by the International Tin
Pool. It is estimated that the scheme has
prevented the unprofitable mining of at least
124,000 tons of metallic tin since it came
into operation. The November, 1932, out-
puts of the principal countries compare with
November, 1931, as under:—

It has been reported that world consump-
tion of tin is now slightly in excess of sup-
plies ; any improvement in trade should
therefore be quickly reflected in a reduction
of stocks and a rise in the price.
:Jc * * *
World stocks of zinc have shown a de-
cline of 94,880 tons for the‘l7 months ended
October, 1932, the figure now being 257,685
tons, or equal to one-sixth of world consump-
tion in 1929, the peak year. Under the
international cartel, production is being
maintained at 45 p.c. of capacity; the out-
put of the Electrolytic Zinc Cos. at Risdon
(Tas.) is not, however, affected thereby.
Stocks of lead, on the other hand, have in-
creased during the same period by 64,175
tons to 503,185 tons, which is a little less
than one-third of consumption in 1929. Of
this stock, 147,000 tons is held in America.
Statistically, the outlook for zinc appears
brighter than for lead.

December, valued at £18,877, which was
more than three times the yield for December,
1931. Chief December producers were Mt.
Coolon, 28390 z., and Batavia, 480 oz. Pro-
duction for 1932 totalled 20,0700 z., valued
at £85,252, nearly twice that for 1931
(10,3210 z., valued at £43,841) and is the
best for the last five years.

A promising reef is being opened up near
Blue Mountain. 35 miles from Coen, Cape
York Peninsula (Q.). The initial crushing
at Charters Towers of 28 tons yielded 2i£oz.
per ton. The find is in rough country, and
development has been hampered by trans-
port difficulties.

“Quidam”; Mining at Sunny Corner is
not what it used to be, but a little alluvial
is being won, mostly by men on the dole,
intermittent little finds of the metal supply-
ing some useful cash. As most of the Sunny
Corner field is on the catchment area of the
Winburndale dam, for the Bathurst water-
supply, there seems a big chance of mining
operations being stopped altogether. Argu-
ment is at present proceeding between the
Bathurst Council, the water authorities and
the Mines Department over the matter, and
goldwashers are holding their breath, and
wording as well as the dry conditions will
permit. Meantime, the Bathurst P. P. Board
is enforcing rabbit-poisoning on the area in
question!

Arsenic, obtained as a by-product at
Wiluna by Leggo’s, is now Westralia’s big-
gest export mineral other than gold. Ship-
ments for 1932 represent nearly half the
value of the total minerals other than gold,
and more than four-fifths of those grouped
under the heading of “miscellaneous.” Apart
from the big and increasing quantity of
arsenic exported, outstanding features of the
return are the absence from the list of
copper and the insignificant export of lead
and silver-lead ores. Both these commodi-
ties were at one time shipped abroad in sub-
stantial quantities. The market, however, is
too low at present for their profitable pro-
duction in the West.

Sons of Gwalia, Leonora (W.A.), treated
150,150 tons for the 12 months ending
December 31, 1932, for a yield valued at
£185.039 (gold at 845.). Working and
development expenses totalled £190,842, leav-
ing a loss of £5803. With premiums, this
is turned to a working profit of about
£125,000. Boulder Perseverance, Kalgoorlie,
milled 87,404 tons for the same period and
showed, on the same basis, a loss of £2736,
plus an additional £12,869 for development.
But including premiums, the loss becomes a
profit of £111,231. It would be more satis-
factory to see these cos. breaking even on
the basis of gold at £4 4s.

Kalgoorlie tributors are impatiently await-
ing payment of the premium from exchange
on the price of gold on a fifty-fifty basis,
which the Privy Council decided they were
entitled to receive from certain Golden Mile
cos. Approximately £300,000 (Australian
currency) awaits distribution, and some of
this cash is expected to be handed out this
month.

sumed at the Biplane Monarch and Sambas
mines, Harrietville, and the Pioneer at
Bright is being worked at a profit. The
site for the Adelong Co.’s dredge at Smoko

Beaufort Hope Gold has been formed,
nominal capital £50,000, to work a valuable
area of alluvial wash at Beaufort (Vic.).
To date, boring has proved 32,000 c.y. of
wash, 3ft. thick, averaging 6.6dwt. per yard.
Extraction is expected to yield a profit of
£50.360 with gold at £7 per ounce, and
further boring is likely to prove a much
greater yardage. From the present small
shaft 20oz. to 30oz. per week is being won.
and anew shaft is to be sunk at a cost of
£3OOO.

BRIEF ANSWERS.
G. 1.: Wound up....M.P.: (1) Avery doubtful
proposition. (2) You can probably forfeit. (3)
Yes; write and ask if a buyer can be found, or if
your payments can be applied to a smaller holding,
treated as fully-paid... .X.Z.: Hold on to your
scrip. Even if the banks were nationalised, com-
pensation should be something in excess of share
par-values. If not, then the Government of the day
would be likely to do anything with any property.
. ...G.F.L.: See “New Registrations” section of
“‘Wild Cat’ Monthly,” February, 1933... .W.C.:
No. 1 is under a cloud, as in the ’nineties; but
don’t forget that it made a startling recovery early
in the century. It certainly has not been hit
so badly this time, either, and its wool turnover
is expanding. No. 2 should be worth holding;
absence of divs. have unduly depressed the stock.
Losses are being reduced. No. 3 is doing better
than usual; but with seasons and prices uncertain,
this is a stock you might unload if pressed....
M.W.: (1) Worth holding, but satisfactory divs. a
couple of years off yet. (2) One of the best coal

BUSINESS, ROBBERY, ETC.
Telegraphic Money Orders
“David”: A couple.of weeks ago a friend
dying in Brisbane needed a close relation who
was in Melbourne. Knowing the Melbourne
friend was practically destitute I volunteered
£lO for fare and travelling expenses. It was
then noon on Saturday, I got to the bank
about 12.15 and, conservative though banks
may be, the manager did not hesitate to cash
my cheque when I explained the urgency.
Round at once to the G.P.0., I found the
“Telmo” department was closed and all my
pleas would not reopen it. I dashed to the
railway. There I discovered I could pay
the fare in Brisbane and it would be advised
telegraphically to Melbourne (without cost),
but they could not pay out cash. I decided
to pay the fare and the advice was received
in time to enable the relation to catch the
Saturday afternoon express; but to enable
him to have some cash I had to ring up a
business acquaintance at a cost of 10s. and
beg him to rush round in his car to my
friend in another suburb and give him £5.
If we had been compelled to wait for the
G.P.O. the friend could not have left Mel-
bourne until an hour after he actually
arrived in Brisbane. The Telmo is closed
from noon on Saturdays until 9.30 on
Mondays! Surely the G.P.O. can arrange
for the service to be available at all hours
of the day and night where telegraph offices
are open, subject to the usual provision of
funds being available. Money is not tele-
graphed unless urgent.
And could not the G.P.O. issue a proper
money order by telegraph instead of the
ordinary telegram form prefixed “MOA”?
The British post office can and does. In
Australia if there is a message on a MOA,
one has to surrender it or go without the
cash. With a money order one can get cash
from a tradesman after hours or pay it into
one’s bank. But a tradesman naturally will
not cash an ordinary “received telegram”
form; only a visit to the P.O. will ensure
its authenticity.
Taxation by Instalments
Dear B., —The payment of taxation by in-
stalments would be a great help to many of
us. Let the Governments issue books ruled
to take stamps, then issue income-tax stamps
(obtainable at all post offices) in denomina-
tions of Is., ss. and 10s. The taxpayer buys
his stamps whenever he can and sticks them
in his book. Assessment and demands are
sent out in the usual way, and upon the due
date he goes to the department and produces
his book. The commissioner cancels stamps to
the proper amount; those not cancelled
remain to his credit. We all know the
approximate amount of our tax per week,
and I for one would gladly buy a weekly
stamp instead of having a cold sweat every
time the darned thing becomes due and I
must have a hectic interview with my bank
manager to get an overdraft for a few weeks.
The cost would be the cost of the books and
the stamps, and this amount would easily
be saved in interest, as under the proposed
scheme the commissioner would be getting ss.
a week from me instead of nothing for 12
months and then £l3-odd in one hit. One of
the _ reasons why there is so little squeal
against the unemployment relief tax is
that it is paid each week instead of in a
“terrible total.” —Yours, Vidle.
The Future of the Tung-nut Oil Industry
From Frank Cotton :
Some of my country friends have asked me to
endeavor- to obtain reliable data as to the possi-
bility of developing an export trade in tung-nut oil
from Australia to Britain. I have carried out that
task to the best of my ability, and a brief summary
of the results obtained may prove interesting to
Bulletin readers.
The present European supply of t.ung oil comes
from China and it is used in the manufacture' of
paints and varnishes on account of its drying
qualities. There is every reason to believe that these
nut trees would grow on some of the coastal land
of Eastern Australia. As a matter of fact, there
are a few mature trees already in existence, which
are looking well and bearing fruit crops. The
trees at maturity are from 12 to 15 feet high,
with a corresponding lateral growth. Allowing for
a reasonable quota of open spaces for light and
air, about 55 trees could be grown to the acre. The
trees come into full bearing in about seven years.
The yield per tree is from 400 to 500 fruits, and
each fruit contains four small nuts. A sample of
Australian-grown nuts unshelled weighed 160 nuts
to the pound. This means a probable yield’ of from
101 b. to 121 b. of nuts per year when the trees are
in full bearing. Assuming that lib. of oil could
be extracted from 21b. of nuts, this would mean
a yield of from 51b. to 61b. of oil per year per
tree. This is certainly an optimistic estimate, for,
as far as can be ascertained, no such high ratio of
oil-extraction has yet been attained in any part, of
the world where mechanical treatment is applied to
oil-bearing vegetable products. The present European
market value of tung-nut oil is about 4s. per
gallon, and a gallon of oil weighs about 91 lb.
On this basis the yield per acre from trees in
full bearing would be under 40 gallons and the
commercial overseas value of the finished product
would be under 3s. per tree per year. The actual
producer of any kind of raw material would be
very fortunate if he received one-third of the world-
parity value of the finished manufactured product ;
consequently the return to the Australian cultivator
would probably be under is. per tree per year. As
long as our Australian orchardists can harvest two
cases of oranges per tree during the bearing season
and get ss. per case for them, they are hardly
likely to become enthusiastic over the prospect; of
tung-nut cultivation.
Still, time may bring many changes. If, as some
writers predict, “the rising tide of color” in the
East eventually overwhelms Western civilisation and
Australia in some future age becomes an oversea
province of a great Chinese or Japanese Empire,
then there might be a possibility of the commercial
cultivation of tung-nut trees in this country—under
Eastern economic conditions.
A Country That Is Being Transformed
Tanta Tyga” : No part of the Common-
wealth has shown itself capable of greater
improvement at comparatively small cost
than the South-east of S. Australia. Here
thousands of acres of very poor (third-
class) re-afforested lands are now providing
millions of feet of softwood, which is being
utilised for'fruit cases and building timber’,
with a continuous supply following on. The
land was let at one-eighth of a penny per
acre before it was resumed, and much of it
grew nothing but bracken. Hundreds of
thousands of acres of second-class lands, in
their native state incapable of carrying more
than a sheep to two acres, now carry as
many as four; and that change is made by
the expenditure of a few shillings in super,
per acre per annum. A drainage scheme near
Millicent has transformed much rough and
inferior pasture land, previously let at 10s.
per square mile; thousands of acres of this
type, improved by draining and by the use
of super., have produced up to 60 bushels of
malting barley, 40 of wheat and 80 of oats
to the acre, and with good farming will do
this for many years in succession. As many
as 16 crops of varying cereals have already
been taken off this land in as many years.
Poor swamp lands once almost perpetually
under water carry, when properly dealt with,
eight sheep to the acre for eight months in
the year, and with successive grazing on
small areas this number will probably be
raised 50 per cent. With an abundant supply
of excellent water only a few feet below
the surface in summertime, small experi-
ments indicate that immense crops can be
grown for green feed or ensilage when dairy-
ing is systematically undertaken; an offi-
cial reported lately to the Department of
Agriculture that much of the land could be
successfully irrigated for the growth of cocks-
foot and strawberry clover for dairying. Up
to 100 tons of mangolds per acre have been
grown on reclaimed swamp lands. Altogether
an area almost as big as Denmark is capable
of being utilised as intensively as that small
kingdom. Incidentally, pigs do remarkably
well, and moreover do more than any other
animal to improve the quality of the land
over which they graze.
The Farmer’s Extravagance
Dear B., —The farmer is not so much to
blame for the position he is in as some seem
to think. Those that bought land when pro-
duce was realising high prices thought they
could substantially reduce , the mortgage in
the three or five years before the balance
was due, but the Federal Government hit
them with land tax assessed on the high pur-
chase price, and income tax was gathered
from every effort the farmer, his wife and
children made. The State was also busy
collecting taxes. I know one farmer who had
a £5OOO mortgage and during the good prices
paid £7OO p.a. in direct taxation and no one
knows how much in indirect, besides his
interest, £3OO. Fie, still owes the mortgage
and to-day can sit back and listen while city
men and a few others talk about the
farmers’ “extravagance” in the good years!
—Yours, J. A. W. (S. Aus.).
Pictures in Business
, “Nakiioda”: We are all influenced by pic-
tures. My small boy lately had a cold and
he started clamoring for a particular brand
of chewing gum which he asserted was an
infallible specific for sore throats. I traced
his medical knowledge back to advice given
to him by an adult, and the adult had got
her medical knowledge from a picture of a
beautiful smiling mother giving the delicacy
to an equally beautiful and smiling child.
The Australian manufacturer has a long way
to go before he can catch up with the Dutch
trader in the art of hypnotising the native
mind. I have before me a brochure issued
to expound the virtues of “Abdijs Siroop,”
a cure for everything from “demam” (fever)
to “sakit toelang” (bone sickness, whatever
that is). It is lavishly illustrated and
printed in Malay and contains glowing testi-
monials from Chinese merchants, Javanese
rajahs, railways porters and the like. The
pamphlet is 25 years old. The Dutchman,
who has a profound knowledge of the native
character, religion, history and language, has
been doing this sort of thing for hundreds
of years, and the Australian trader will have
to do as well, or he will be only wasting his
time.
The Interest Factor
Dear B., —Mr. E. Aitchison’s scheme for
a Farm Mortgage Corporation (B.
28/12/’32) will make a powerful appeal to
men on the land. Two years ago I analysed
the returns of 39 farms in S. Australia,
each spreading over a period of 10 years.
From the weighted averages of these re-
turns I found that the cost of production
of wheat was 4s. 10.26 d. per bushel and that
the fixed overhead charge (interest at 6 p.c.
and depreciation) was 2s. o.Bld. per bushel.
The, average price of land at that time was
£7 15s. per acre and the average yield for
10 years was 15 bushels per acre. Neither
the price of the land was excessive nor the
average yield low. Professor Perkins arrived
at practically the same results at the Gov-
ernment farm at Turretfield, which was 1 run
as a business proposition. This was further
confirmed by the analyses of the particulars
and returns of 140 farms collected by the
field officers of the Department of Agri-
culture. At the time the interest rate for
advances to farmers was about 7 p.c. to
74 p.c. Although that rate has now been
reduced under the Premiers’ plan, many
farmers are still paying from 6 p.c. to 64
p.c. for overdrafts advanced to them on the
security of their farms.
If Mr. Aitchison’s scheme could be put
into operation and Ins corporation able to
borrow money at (say) 34 p.c., and if this
money could be loaned to farmers at 4 p.c..
then the reduction in overhead or fixed
charges would be equivalent to Sd. per
bushel. With a corresponding reduction in
other cost factors, too, then wheat can be
grown at a profit for about 3s. 3d. per bushel.
Some farmers can grow it for less, but when
all cost factors are taken into account, in-
cluding the reduction in interest rate, then
3s. 3d. per bushel would be a reasonable
figure.—Yours, Yeoman (S.A.).
“J. 0.0.”: There always are thousands of
rabbits in my rough country; and whenever
I read that rabbits are an asset I might feel
rich enough to buy another Rolls Royce if
I didn’t keep a few account sales on my file.
Here’s the story my latest tell me. I sent
away 1490 skins (three bags) weighing
1571 b. Prices varied from Id. per pound
(kittens) to U4d. (fawns). The lot brought
£2 ss. 10d., less commission and warehousing
—£2 Os. Id. net, or almost an exact 3d. per
pound on the average. Other charges:
Strychnine (50z.), £1 Bs. 9d.; rail, Bs, 4d.:
cartage to rail, 25.; exchange, 6d. Total,
£1 19s. 7d. This left me a clear 6d. to pay
for the bags and the time I spent pre-
paring baits and getting up at 4 a.m. to
skin the —the assets.

“L.A.T.”: In our output of blankets a
serious slump has occurred. The production
dropped from 1,097,178 in 1916 to 875,888
in 1930. Single blankets require approxi-
mately 441 b. wool; threequarters, 61b. to
71b. ; double, 7lb. to 81b. ; large double, 91b.
to 1041 b. The loss of wool consumption
involved in this reduced output of 221,120
blankets is thus very substantial. Kapok, a
vegetable fibre, is produced in large quanti-
ties in the East Indies (black labor). As
it is not grown in Australia it enters the
country subject only to a 10 p.c. primage
duty. It is the chief packing for bed quilt-
ing. The extent to which this has displaced
wool can easily be assessed by the above
figures. Much of our cheaper wool should
be absorbed in this branch of woollen manu-
facture ; but with kapok competition it does
not pay the grazier to send his locks (chiefly
table locks) to the sales when the distance
is over 80 or 100 miles. This represents a
serious loss to Australia ; and it is all avoid-
able.

“5.J.8.”: Timber-cutters will hear with
interest of the arrival of an English axe-
blade designed and constructed in Sheffield
for use on Australian timber. So far prac-
tically all axes used by Australian choppers
have been imported from America or
Sweden; English manufacturers, up till
lately, seem to have made no effort to turn
out an article to compete with these. The
new Sheffield blade is reported to be the
result of two years’ experiment, and repre-
sents an earnest bid for the Australian
market.

“Long Steel” ; Queenslanders were not re-
presented at the recent conference of citrus-
growers held at Gosford (N.S.W.) to dis-
cuss export problems. The reason is that,
Queensland is not interested in export pos-
sibilities for oranges. Her growers have
adopted every variety known to man. The
result is that uniformity of fruit is simply
not possible so far as Bananalanders are con-
cerned, and their marketing men stayed
away. Yet the northern parts of Queens-
land particularly are very suitable for citrus
fruits, and in the Cooktown district excel-
lent oranges are grown. However, as with
other lines of primary produce in the
northern State, the producer only begins to
inquire what his prospective customer really
requires when he finds out by bitter experi-
ence what he will not buy.
H* =l= • S»S
The Communists had a short-lived win in
Westralia lately, and persuaded the Timber
Workers’ Union to hand over control to the
usual “Central Committee.” Only one mis-
take was made: there were too many -inis
and -vitclies on the committee, and the good
Australian rank and file soon rebelled against
being ordered about by this body. The Com-
monwealth railways were most concerned:
they will get their sleepers, if a trifle late,
and Moscow will get a report that things are
not yet quite ripe for the Revolution in the
West.

“The Command to Love,” which took the
stage at Sydney Cri. on Saturday night, is
a Viennese comedy of that city’s very latest
vintage, and concerns itself with the adven-
tures of a military attache of the French
Legation in Madrid, which provides a pic-
turesque setting. The subject matter is the
fine art of philandering, demonstrated very
much in the manner of the Restoration
dramatists —the ■ art is an I old one, s and its
technique differs very little from age to age.
Marie Bremner as Yum-Yum in ‘‘The
Mikado
The first act is explanatory; the second
expository; the third fills in the time that,
must reasonably elapse. before the audience
can be expected to go. home. Half the first
act on Saturday night was occupied with
oVations tendered to the various. members
of the cast, who had to acknowledge these
tributes to the success they were about to
achieye before they could commence the duty
of impersonation. Theo Shall, the reason
for the play’s production in Sydney, entered
during one of these extraneous interludes
and missed an individual welcome. The
general impression given by the portion of
the act that was acted was that if diplo-
mats are the childish imbeciles they are
made to appear in this presentation there
is a good deal to be said for the late Presi-
dent Wilson’s attitude towards their profes-
sion. Act II exhibits Mr. Shall (Gaston,
the attache) and Coral Brown (Manuela,
wife of the Spanish Minister of War) mak-
ing love, a process prolonged by frequent
interruptions per door and telephone. Inter-
ruptions in such circumstances get laughs
much more easily than dialogue. Any-
way, Mr. Shall cannot depend on dia-
logue for his effects, because his English,
until one gets used to it, is at times a little
difficult to follow, and his voice seldom car-
ries further thafi the fourth row of the
stalls. He is precisely the same in the role
of the Marquis du Saint Lac, captain of
Spahis, as he was in the part of the Tyrolean
waiter in “Autumn Crocus,” which may or
may not prove that Tyrolean waiters and
French marquises are sui generis. Miss
Brown takes the feminine side in the en-
counter with considerable skill, Campbell
Copelin’s bluff personality suits the Spanish
Minister of War, Roger Barry makes a pre-
sentable attache’s secretary (an unusual
job) and Kenneth Brampton looks the part
as Court Physician. Jean Duncan’s histrionic
powers are not unduly taxed by the part of
the French Ambassador’s wife, and the other
members of the cast patiently endeavor to
make the very commonplace remarks allotted
to them sparkle with Viennese verve. Theo
Shall, as producer, made good use of the
Firm’s extensive stock of props., but in-
cluded a dock which registered twenty past
three at five in the afternoon, and stayed
that way for half an hour.

The story and the words of many of the

lost none of its appeal. The most unfor-
tunate feature of the revival at Sydney
ltoyal on Saturday was the unsuitability of
Gregory' Stroud for the part of Strephon.
His baritone voice was in excellent con-
dition, particularly in the two duets “None
Shall Part Us” and “If We’re Weak Enough
to Tarry,” but he failed to suggest in appear-
ance or carriage a lover in his twenties.
As the Lord Chancellor, Ivan Menzies was
in fine fettle. He scampered ludicrously
across the stage in his long robes, played
the clown with infectious glee, raised peals
of laughter by his rendering of “A Very
Susceptible Chancellor” and “Said I to
Myself, Said I,” and overcame the vocal
pitfalls of “Love Unrequited Robs Me of
My Rest” with his usual adroitness. Marie
Bremner was an admirable Phyllis, and
Mary Hotham’s lolanthe reached a very high
level in her appeal delivered to the Lord
Chancellor while she was kneeling at his
feet. As the Fairy Queen Evelyn Gardiner
was an imposing figure, and her rich con-
tralto voice was heard to good effect. John
Ralston, in the red jacket and busby of the
sentry in the palace yard, was as sound as
ever. His solemn rendering of “When All
Night a Chap Remains” was heartily
approved. Leo Darnton and Bernard Man-
ning paired well as the Earls Mountararat
and Tolloller, and Grace Crotty, Dawn
Harding and Rona Wimpney pleasingly por-
trayed the Fairy Queen’s assistants. The
chorus of Fairies and Peers added to the
piece’s charm. Andrew MacCunn’s orchestra
was a continual pleasure to the ear.

Doris Fitton’s Independent Theatre
Players presented Sil-Vara’s “Caprice,” a
comedy in three acts, at Sydney Savoy on
Saturday. The play deals with Viennese
life, and, like most dramas that come from
that gay city, is light in plot but has a
daring theme and smart dialogue. The In-
dependents’ presentation lacked brilliance
and exuberance, but there were redeeming
flashes. Acting honors went to Doris Fitton
and the very juvenile Peter Osborn. Doris
Fitton produced the play, and Don Finley
designed the scenery. The Independents’
next production will be “Precious Bane,” by
Edward Lewis, adapted from the story by
Mary Webb.

Adelaide, which is apt to be left out when

bably early and next after Melbourne.

On Saturday night Scott Alexander’s
Repertorians revived “The Fergussons,” an
American domestic comedy. It ought to be
easy for any resident of Sydney who fre-
quents the talkies and reads' the magazines
to which the population is most exposed to
give a colorable imitation of a citizen of the
U.S.A., but Harry Farrell was the only Re-
pertorian who got anywhete near it. Setting
aside matters of accent and manner, Dorothy
Whiteley as a mother, Helen Kent as her
daughter, and William Rees as a papa gave
meritorious characterisations.
Leo Darnton as Nanki-Poo.
There seems to be no urgent demand at
Melb. Tiv. at present for the deportation
under guard of Syd Beck, though that pie-
faced comedian’s chief business remains un-
varied. It consists of the mispronunciation
of common or garden English, a device which
casts no undue strain on an audience’s in-,
telligence and sometimes has a quaint effect.
Portion of the programme is taken up by
the two Lampinos. Mr. Lampino is a gentle-
man with what appears to be a carefully cul-
tivated foreign accent, his partner a lady who
invites inquirers into the mysteries of the
future to write questions on pieces of paper,
burns the documents in a brass bowl without
looking at them and then answers the ques-
tions, presumably to the satisfaction of the
questioners. The i-est of the bill is occupied
with comedy sketches of the order in which
the low comedian makes a mistake about the
number of his hotel bedroom, with results
that are left to the imagination by the black-
out man. The chief virtue of this turn,
unlike the stage play of the same genus, is
that it is short.

The renaissance of Alfred Frith threatens
to prolong the Nellie Bramley season at
Melbourne Palace into its second year of
continuous performance. The comedian with
the rat-trap countenance is a hard and con-
scientious worker in the cause of public
entertainment in “Baa, Baa, Black Sheep,”
a piece of utter blither, the responsibility
for which is shared by lan Hay and P. G.
Wodehouse. As a reveller escaping from a
raided night club in the garb of a clergyman,
Frith is genuinely funny. If the play-
wrights saw their brain child as reared by
Frith it is suspected that they would fail
to recognise their offspring. As a character
actor, the comedian Frith isn’t in it with
such artists as Cecil Kellaway, but as an
unadulterated farce merchant he knows his
onions. The fact that he lacks seconders
in the remainder of the company passes un-
noticed. The customary weekly change is
indefinitely postponed to enable Frith to
exhaust the possibilities of the present
opus.
Poverty Point
“L.H.P.”: Anniversary Night, Jan. 26,
ISS3, saw three theatres open in Sydney,
the attractions being nigger minstrels at the
Gaiety, panto, at the Royal, and “Boccac-
cio” by the Melville Opera Co. at the Opera
Bernard Manning as the Mikado.
House. Fifty years later we find more
theatres, but of these on Jan. 26 four were
given over to and the Cri. and Savoy
were shut. Only the Royal, Her Majesty’s
and Tivoli presented fiesh-and-blood shows..
Now there’s talk of turning Her Majesty’s
into a Woolworth store, which will leave
the second city of the Empire where it was
half a century ago in the matter of theatres.
“Cuthbert”: The applause, largely indis-
criminate, and very often detrimental to
musical effect, lavished by Australian audi-
ences on the principals of the Italian ,opera'
co. brought here by the Firm has pow,
become indispensable to these singers. Lately,
some operas have been broadcast from a
Sydney studio, and one of the listeners (pro-
bably representative of many) wrote to the
“S. M. Herald” protesting against the “con-
tinuous hand-clapping at the studio.” It was
explained, in all seriousness, that it was
necessary for the singers to have a l , “back-
ground supplied by a studio audience.
The applause helped them , to re-create the
atmosphere of the stage to' which they were
accustomed..... An operatic atmosphere
had to be re,-created.”. It wouldn’t surprise
me now to be told that they have claquers
in their entourage to encourage them while
they practise their scales.
“Lond.”: “Punch” has at last struck a
blow’ against the deep-blue tone of .London’s
revived variety shows-—“grimy quips and
badinage, all . more suitable to a saloon bar
than a music-hall. .. .deplorable in' its
lowering of taste... .indiscriminate vulgar-
ising of a houseful of people, many of them
quite young... .dirty and degrading... .it is
hard to say which is the more sad, the gross-
ness of the performers or the delight with
which it is received.” As a matter of fact,
it is just what modern London demands —
and naturally gets.
“L.H.P.”: Passed over in Wellington
(M.L.) the other day, Bill Densem, known
from one end of the Shivery Isles to the
other. In his latter days a teacher of elo-
cution and acting, he was in his prime, a
fine singer, and in amateur opera he was a
notable Gaspard (“Les Cloches”). He made
his professional debut in Sydney at the Cri.
in August, 1893, in a lantern show entitled
“Picture, Song and Story.” Later he be-
came stage manager at Sydney Tiv. Before
joining the “purfesh,” he managed Scoullar
and Co., Dunedin merchants.
“Spokeshave”: The reason why stage
plays are becoming more and more like dress
rehearsals for the talkies is not far to seek.
Take- Noel Coward’s spectacular “Caval-
cade.” Nearly a million people saw it at
Drury Lane and another million are ex-
pected to survey it on tour. But that is
nothing to the public it will tap when it
is celluloided. At a conservative estimate
100,000;000 will, pay to see it.
“Hamfat”: The earthquake the talkies
have brought upon the theatrical world has
brought down the New York Palace Theatre,
America’s vaudeville centre. It is the place
where Charlie Chaplin, amongst others, had
his first American appearance. To get on
the bill at the Palace was sufficient to stamp
an act as first quality. The management
paid £7OO p.w. to Sara Bernhardt for a very
short appearance nightly. Recently it has’

Mikado."
had to stagger under appalling costs —£1000
a week to Eddie Cantor and a similar amount
to George Jessel were items —and in spite
of making the show continuous, which has
saved the big London houses, the strain has
proved too great. The house is going over
to the fillums.
“Cooramin”: I don’t know whether it
was an Australian production or not, but
lately I sat through a photoplay that was
supposed to represent Australian horsemen
in pursuit of outlaws. These gentlemen,
when dismounting, took both feet out of the
stirrups and slipped off like a woman. Their
feats in the saddle, compared with the sort
of things one sees in American pictures,
were a libel on the crack riders of the big
back country, now brought together annu-
ally in pastoral centres. The rugged haunt
of the outlaws looked all right until a couple
of garden seats under the trees at a seaside
resort intruded at the edge of the scene.
Then someone sniffed audibly.
“L.H.P.”: From New York comes news
of the death at 92 of John R. Rogers, still
remembered in Australia by the oldsters.
He married Minnie Palmer, who was
brought here by Williamson, Garner and
Musgrove to star in “My Sweetheart,” which
opened on Boxing Night, 1886; at' the old
Sydney Opera House, and Rogers, a sunny
soul who always signed himself “Yours
merrily,” gave Sydney some new ideas in
the matter of theatrical advertising.
“P. Pawnticket”: Raw material for a
talkie in these parts cost 2%d. per foot;
until picture-makers get over the painful
recollection of this fact few really first-
class Australian pictures will be produced.
My wanderings in studios have impressed
upon me the agony of mind that goes
through the place if a foot or so of film is
wasted. It does not help production. An
author would be similarly handicapped if
he had to write a novel with the knowledge
that he would have to account for every
wasted scrap of paper. Hollywood reckons
it normal to shoot 20,000 ft. of film to make
1000 ft. of picture.
“Hamer”: At 75, Helen Fergus, one-time
dramatic favorite in Sydney, is doing a bit
of film-acting in circumstances . that are
rather remarkable. For 40 years she had a
growth on the lung which a couple of years
John Ralston as the Board of Control in
“The Mikado.”
ago caused her to go to the hospital with
the expectation of never coming out again.
She, had miraculous luck —“coughed the
thing out,” to use the expression of her
doctor —and went home completely cured.
The lady’s first husband was “Colonel”
D’Orsay Ogden, well known in Australian
theatrical history, and her daughter, Nellie
Ogden (more lately using Nellie Ferguson
for stage purposes), was a star child-actress
—probably the most weepful “little Jo” the
Australian theatre-public ever saw.
“Cauboy” : I see that the King has author-
ised a standard rendering of the National
Anthem by civilian and military bands and
orchestras. The matter will be the subject
of an Army order, and presumably gramo-
phone records will be required for convey-
ing the spirit of the regulation to conduc-
tors overseas. The rearrangement does not
•alter the harmony, but the tempo will be
fixed to convey the necessary impression of
dignity. It would be interesting to know
iWliether the order is a result of the over-
zealous efforts of foreign virtuosi and con-
ductors to emphasise their reverence for the
.Crown. A Russian pianist who recently
•visited Australia played so many variations
on the theme that it assumed the propor-
tions of a sonata.

SHADOW SHOWS.
At Sydney Lyceum just now, Douglas
Fairbanks is bounding zestfully all over a
tropic island as “Mr. Robinson Crusoe.” He
is there because of a bet. In one month he
makes enough useful gear, out of little or
nothing, to shame the annual handicrafts
exhibition of a zealous troop of Scouts. Man
Friday materialises but refuses to grovel, and
after a fierce scrap Doug takes from Friday’s
necklet two radio valves. A chunk of zinc
ripped from the defeated blackamoor’s canoe
and a conch for a loudspeaker complete
the wireless set. A runaway native bride
complicates things. When the island is
inundated by yelling savages Doug has to
take her back to the TJ.S.A. with him. He
solves this problem by putting her in Zieg-
feld’s Follies. Taken in the spirit in which
it is offered the film will delight old as well
as young.
“Self-made Lady,” the other, is an ama-
teurish English effort which shows the rise,
in slow-motion, of a slum hoyden (Heather
Angel). With a boxer and a doctor’s son
she is involved in manslaughter what time
the blackmailer lurks behind a convenient
shrub. Clearing out, she becomes a great
dress-designer and wins the love of a licen-
tious lord. She discovers next that she is
the daughter of a duke. Here the producer,
who should have been proceeded against an
hour earlier for loitering, seems to have
concluded that the thing has gone far enough,
so commands the lord to attempt her honor
in order that the doctor’s son may save her
and gather her into his arms. Simultaneously
the boxer removes the blackmailer and
escapes to Europe with an Aching Heart,
for he, too, Loved Her. Harry Wilcoxon, as
the boxer, is fairly good.
“Me and My Gal,” at Sydney Regent,
must be about the most inept gangster that
has come out of Hollywood. Spencer Tracy,
as a riverside cop, helps to explain why crime
is such a paying industry in the TJ.S.A. He
wisecracks about his beat, pinching food,
such as bananas, for immediate consumption
from passing carts, having meals in a restau-
rant, where he exchanges badinage with Joan
Bennett (a gum-chewing employee), and get-
ting laughs by such artless means as buying
a hat from a low-comedy Jew and jumping
off a wharf after a drunk. The drunk is an
exerescence after the tradition of old-fashioned
English films. His antics interfere with the
continuity for nearly half the picture, and
he has nothing to do with the story. George
Walsh is the leader of a gang of hank-robbers.
After a successful coup he takes refuge with
the swag in the home of Joan Bennett’s
friend, Marion Burns, who loves him as she
did in the happy days before he went to gaol
and she got married. Spencer’s dog and
Marion’s paralysed father do their best to
tell Spencer where George is, but he is too
stupid to understand, and when his sus-
picions are aroused, instead of having the
place surrounded he blunders into the room
alone and lets the desperado take a pot shot
at him. But perhaps the hardest feature to
swallow is that Joan Bennett —an entirely
unconvincing Bowery lass—should fall in
love with such a • flash oaf as Mr.' Tracy
makes the policeman. The best that can be
said for the picture is that the wit is as
innocuous—also as primitive—as that of
“On Our Selection.”
“Gold Fever,” which, inexplicably, is the
subsidiary, is an unusually good melodrama
with a strong cast and some fine crowd
scenes. Practically the whole of the action
takes place in a bank of which Walter
Huston is the president \Ang. manager).
He is worshipped by the staff, being a true
American democrat who chews gum and
bonnets the commissionaire every morning
when he comes on duty, but the directors
distrust him. A cashier wh 0 loves Walter’s
wife, Kay Johnson, and is in the power of
gangsters nearly ruins the bank. Pat
O’Brien is the heroic underling who saves
the day and wins the hand of the lovely
typist j Constance Cummings. The shots of
the mighty safe, which can only be opened
by one who knows the secret of its mechan-
ism, are interesting; and the panic run on
the bank which follows the publication of
the news that thieves have got away with
most of its assets is highly realistic up to a
point. The dialogue is bright, and the
interest never lets up.
Most admirers of “The Maid of the Moun-
tains” will be disappointed with the film
version at Sydney Plaza. Director Lupino
Lane has cut the music to the bone and
tinkered with the text to no good purpose.
His weakness as a film producer is that he
can only think in terms of the other medium.
It is sad to see such artists as Harry Welch-
man, Nancy Brown and Betty Stockfield
battling against the odds imposed on them.
The comic relief, which isn’t particularly
comic, is furnished by Wallace Lupino and
Gus McNaughton.
* * *
In “Tess of the Storm Country,” at Syd-
ney State, ' sentiment, sweet and strong,
triumphs over probability as regards such
natural phenomena as drowning, maternity
and the forces of gravity. Janet Gaynor
makes an appealing heroine—but what a
voice ! Claude Gillingwater is incisive as the
elder Garfield, but the others arc colorless.
Louise Glosser Hale runs away with “No
More Orchids,” a comitragedy in which
wealthy Carole Lombard is urged to marry
a European prince, though she loves Lyle
Talbot. Carole’s grandfather (C. Aubrey
Smith) wants to sacrifice her in order to
gratify his hatred of her father (Walter
Conolly) .• The father, after seeing the girl
married to the right man, suicides in a mono-
plane crash, leaving his insurance money to
save his bank from the machinations of Mr.
Smith.
* * *
As most film-addicts will gather from the
title, “The Thirteenth Guest,” at Sydney
liaymarket, is another Falling Body or Fre-
quent Corpse film. The first gasp is sounded
when the supposed tenement of one who in
life was Ginger Rogers, heroine, is . dis-
covered sitting at a table. Death by electro-
cution is diagnosed. But Miss Rogers is
presently found driving a stolen police car,
so Lyle Talbot, a modern Sherlock Holmes,
develops an interest ifi the proceedings. The
family lawyer is added to the mortuary list
before the mystery is. solved. Frances Rich,
daughter of Irene, does good work in a small
part.

“Wilderness” : I am in a position to empha-
tically endorse the claim of “W.P.T.” (B.
25/l/’33) that, when rain fills up dried-up
waterholes, pelicans transfer to these from
permanent waters quantities of young fish
THE QUALITY OF PATIENCE IS NOT STRAINED.

and frogs. Indeed, I have known a pelican,
when a rush job was in hand, to hire numbers
of female kangaroos or wallabies to carry the
fish and frogs in their pouches for restock-
ing his preserved water. I use the term
“•preserved” advisedly, for the pelicans keep
a careful eye on their stock, frequently run-
ning them through a race made by digging
a shallow gutter along the bank at water
level. There is also always a pelican in
attendance as boundary-rider, his job being
to keep the frogs in the paddock. Of course,
dulling and lifting were practised by other
pelicans, and these caused much bad blood
in the community. One pelican I knew im-
ported large green frogs from the coast and
started to breed them. A neighbor got away
with a prize bullfrog, which was later iden-
tified in the pelican court, the thief being
duly sentenced to death and executed.

“Arachnid”: “Roga” (B. 18/l/’33) would
do well to hurry to the museum with that
Tom Mix spider of his that catches “any
insect” with a looped rope; and he had
better take with him the spider’s wife, which
stuffs the prey in a “pouch like a kangaroo.”
The Magnificent Spider of North Queens-
land does something of the sort, but his line
has no loop and he fishes for a parti-
cular variety of moth, a sticky bead on the
end of the line doing the trick. Also, he
has no visible wife. Indeed, the spider who
keeps house with his missus of the moment,
except for a few fleeting moments in the
breeding season, has not yet been catalogued.

“Black Mountain”: At Upton Zoo in Eng-
land, a monkey recently committed suicide.
Hanging in an open-air cage was a rope.
The monkey amused spectators with a few
antics on it, but the applause evidently
wasn’t hearty enough, for it calmly chewed
off a few yards of the rope and retired to a
tree. Here it tied one end to a bough and
made a slip-knot noose at the other. Then with
the greatest of deliberation the ape climbed
as high as the rope would allow, inserted its
head, pulled tight the slip-knot and jumped.
The keeper of the Zoo called a doctor, whose
verdict was instantaneous death.

“Fan Kwai”: Queensland Customs officers
have again realised how peculiar are the
ways of the Heathen Chinee. Searching a
steamer from the Flowery Land at Towns-
ville, they noted a peculiar chirping in a
bathroom. A kerosene-tin full of soiled
clothing was emptied, and found to con-
tain a false bottom. Under this was a
number of Japanese love-birds, the impor-
tation of which is forbidden. There were
tiny perforations for air, but the birds were
evidently not getting enough of this—hence
[he chirping. It is supposed that they were
kept in proper cages until arrival at Towns-
ville, and then transferred to the tin. No
one claimed them.

has had four husbands. Originally two
birds were caught
when only fledge-
lings, and they
lived more or less
in harmony until
an argument with
a strange cat
ended the male’s
exist ence. The
widow moped for
a week, and then
disappeared, re-
turning after a
few days with a
new mate. He
lasted only a week
or two ; his depre-
dations among the
chickens earned
him a bullet. Mrs.
Maggie did not
appear to mind
until next spring
arrived; then,
after a period of
restlessness, she
went husband-
hunting again.
She was away a
day, and came
back with what
was obviously a
tame magpie from
some elose-at-
hand home. No-
body claimed him,
however, and he
stayed until his
death in the fol-
lowing winter
from some bird
complaint not
diagnosed. Mrs.
Maggie was ob-

hastily and was
never seen again. During the argument the
perfidious male kept out of sight round a
corner. To date he remains Mrs. Maggie’s
husband; but if anything happens to him
no doubt she will set off again for No. 5.
The elder Weller’s views on “vidders” seem
applicable to magpies.
“Cymro”: At Mitchell’s station, Kings-
town,' near Uralla (N.S.W.), a woman clean-
ing a window during a storm had her hand
flat on a pane. There came a flash of light-
ning., stunning the woman, and leaving an
indelible imprint of her hand on the glass.
I saw this in 1929, two or three years after
the occurrence.
“Frig.”: On January 15, 1913, lightning
struck a house in the Coorparoo district (Q.),
what time an old dame was seated on a
chair upholstered with brocade.. She re-
ceived portion of the discharge and on the
back of her frock was printed minutely the
flowery design on the back of the chair.
“Muldoon”: Regarding the pictorial tricks
played by lightning, here’s my experience.
During a heavy storm recently the head
teacher’s room in the Cannon Hill school,
Brisbane, was struck at nine o’clock at night.
In the morning I found a picture lying on
the floor; its metal cord had melted through
where it crossed over the brass hook. Though
the fall was eight feet, the glass was un-
broken, but all across the half-inch gilding,
at right angles to its length, w r ere fine hair-
like lines, dark or brownish, slightly waved,
close together and roughly parallel.

to the Alsatian dog is that his .size and
strength, plus his intelligence, are likely to
make him a dangerous beast should he decide
to take to the wild life, as so many other
sheep dogs and other varieties of tyke have
done in Australia. The same may be said
of the Australian kangaroo dog, nowadays
not too common. It is rare for this follow
to go bush, but it has been recorded. Near Mt.
Morgan (Q.) a party of relief workers heard
loud complainings from the scrub by the track
on which they were travelling. Investiga-
tion showed a boy treed by two evidently
wild kangaroo dogs, which withdrew on pres-
sure, with very bad grace. On the same day
a man, on horseback this time, reported he
THE FRYING PAN OR THE FIRE.
“Yes, I have to do my own typing. My wife is so expensive I can’t
afford a typist.”
“Gosh! My typist’s so expensive I can’t afford a wife!’
had met the two dogs, which menaced him
but retreated before the stockwhip he was
carrying. If gentlemen like these should
cross with the equally big and far more
brainy Alsatian, life in the Great Outback
would gain in spice.

“Rana” : The reason the green frog of which
“Chelsus” vainly tried to rid himself
returned as remorselessly as a time-payment
collector (B. 25/l/’33) was that it is the
nature of that particular frog to do so.
“Chelsus” will have to take his boarder much
farther afield than lie has done before he is
likely to be rid of him. As a liome-finder.
having once selected one, the green frog is
the equal of any homer pigeon. But why seek
to get rid of him? lie is an intelligent,
sociable beast and a whale on cockroaches
and similar pests. Ilis only drawback is his
tendency to lift up his voice in song at un-
reasonable hours when he estimates rain
is coming. No, “Chelsus,” spare that frog!
“Vosadina”: It has been asserted that the
Dobu (Papua) natives are the only people who
use a kite for fishing. They attach a bunch
of spider’s web t 0 the tail. Recently I was
surprised to see the people of the island of
Iwa (Marshall Bonnets) also using the
kite. They assured me that it was an old-
established method with them. Monckton
gives another curious- method of catching
fish in Papua. Women milk their breasts
into the stream and thus coax the fish to
the surface, where the scoop-net is awaiting
them.

“Q.E.D.”: A cross new in the history
of Australian ornithology has been evolved
in the aviary of a Goondiwindi (Q.) grazier.
A blue bonnet, in the absence of a lady of
his own kind, mated with a pale-headed
rosella hen, and in November last became a
father. The offspring, which has now been
flying for about three weeks, is a blue bonnet
in appearance, with the exception that he
is inclined to be pale green on the back,
whereas the real blue bonnet is grey.
AUSTRALIA SPEAKING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a clear voice ringing, ringing through
the fragrant morning air,
And the bell-bird stops to listen and the
dingo from his lair
Seems to intercept the message as it rolls
the land across,
Carrying content to thousands: “Billy Wood-
full’s won the toss.”
Where the great white mountain gum-trees
gleam like ghosts across the dusk,
And the creek drops, singing softly, through
the tree-fern and the musk,
Where the scented night-wind murmurs
through the wattle and the pine,
Peals the cheerful, brisk announcement:
“Two-toothed wethers—six-and-nine.”
Scene, a humble wayback shanty, and a
crowd has gathered there,
Strong, determined, sunburnt bushmen, bend :
ing heads as if in prayer;
And an almost- reverent silence falls upon
the motley mob
As they get the news momentous* “Kibosh
wins from Noscybob.”
Lo, it’s good to be at Gunya, where the red-
gums kiss the stream,
And the great calm river’s bosom holds the
golden sunset gleam;
And the brooding wild-fowl waken as they
rush the tidings through
To the land’s extremest confines: “That
makes Bradman eighty-two.”

“Castle Hill”; A sinister and suspicious
happening at Townsville (N.Q.) has set the
town by the ears, recalling as it does the
sudden ending in America of Phar Lap.
An Australorp hen had been entered for
the N.Q. egg-laying competition. The bird
was a comparative unknown on starting, but
rapidly forged to the front, and with only
five weeks _to go was a strong favorite
in the betting. Then it was discovered in
the pen at the Show Ground with the head
missing and the body badly battered. The
pen was closely guarded against cats and
other enemies, and the suggestion that the
champion had been kicked to death by jeal-
ous rivals has been scouted. Peeling runs
high, and there is talk of asking Premier
Forgan Smith to appoint a Royal Commis-
sion to inquire into the tragedy.

“M.L.C.”: Keeping goldfish may not
appear a very exciting pastime, but many
people seem to be bitten with the craze, and
zoologists have' lately been pointing out the
danger .of spreading the parasites which
cause disease in goldfish to streams or ponds
in which they would attack our freshwater
fish. White-spot disease is a case in point.
The young infusorian (about l-500th of an

inch long) meets a fish and burrows beneath
its skin. After about a week it breaks
through the blister thus formed (being by
this time about l-50th of an inch) and settles
down on the bottom to form a cyst, out of
which from 200 to 2000 young ones may
develop in a day or so. They are quickly
liberated and set about to search for a host.
These young parasites are not fastidious,
and will infect any fish they encounter.
Those who make a hobby of keeping goldfish
should be warned of the very great danger
of turning fish, or water in which they
have been kept, into any drain where they
may filter into a stream or pond.
“F.”: A most remarkable mir-
age was seen as the Canberra and
Port Brisbane were coming from
Melbourne and passing Gabo
Island. It seemed as though the
vessels were passing through two
long lines of cliffs, over which water-
falls were pouiring, while the light-
house at Gabo appeared to be of
tremendous height, like a tall
smoke stack. A steamer travelling
south, although not visible, left
four distinct streams of smoke, and
another, which had long since passed over
the horizon, was still visible.

“Mako” : The stories of strange monsters
that live in the depths of Maoriland rivers
and ponds have a foundation in fact. Some
years ago the Waikato River was in heavy
flood, and in the settling-down process the
waters cast many strange creatures on the
land. Some of these looked at first glance
like ancient logs, but proved to be eels of
such girth that they had lost all semblance
to the surface variety. They lived in deep
water and never encountered the baits of
fishermen.

“G.D.T.”: Camped at Princess Charlotte
Bay, I awoke to find all my blacks had de-
serted me. I grabbed my revolver and
went in search of them. ‘ Unexpectedly I
was helped by the rising sound of voices.
Dogs were barking, piccaninnies squealing
and women yelling. The word “kalka”
(.spear) reached my ears several times. I
doubled my pace, thinking that a fight was
on. Presently I perceived fires. Round the
main fire the male abos. were sitting, smok-
ing, holding their spears and womerahs, and
occasionally laughing heartily. In the middle
of the clearing the women were running
hither and thither, armed with yam sticks,
torches and all sorts of implements. Sounds
of hitting were frequent, increasing in
violence and volume. Then I saw the king of
the Ivookoo-Lama-Lama tribe clutching in his
arms a young lubra. The women were
beating him mercilessly, not caring where
they struck. Presently lie collapsed, bring-
ing the girl down with him. At this the
women ceased their outcry. Their place was
taken by the men of the tribe, who formed
a ring round the fallen couple, shouting and
shaking their spears and womerahs. They
began to dance, at first prancing about
individually, but gradually co-ordinating
their movements till these were in uni-
son. A sound like a long-drawn moan
developed into a song, in which the word
“kochamba” was often repeated. The
song ended, but the dance went on.
All the women sat in a circle round the
main fire, playing on 1 reeds, or rather
splinters of native bamboo, producing sounds
like those from a jew’s-harp, but more

musical. Aften ten minutes of this the
men finished their dance, with a great
yelp and stopped. The ring broke up, reveal-
ing the dazed old king sitting on the ground
and still holding his bi'ide in his arms. The
male members of the tribe began to approach
him one by one, addressing him in their
native tongue. A boy who had served on a
lugger began a speech in English : “You black,
people look out him old pfeller our king
Tim-I-Rai, him properly married. Him king
guur (good) pfeller, gin gurr pfeller too.
Hurray!” Then he came forward and shook
hands, first with the old black and afterwards
with his bride. The next day his majesty
could not attend to my needs, being bruised
and cut all over, but with great pride and
the help of a row of stones he conveyed to
me that it was his thirty-sixth marriage!

“Shrewsbury”: Some time ago a Bulle-
tin par referred to a plague of musk-
rats in England, the beasts having originally
been imported in the hope of establishing
a trade in their fur. The pioneers only
arrived in 1927, but now they are such
a pest in some parts that the ; Board of
Agriculture is taking desperate, steps to ex-
tirpate them,' a special Act. having been
passed. Expert trappers have been imported,
and one of these is waging a vigorous cam-
paign in Shropshire, where the brutes have
become strongly established in the Severn.
In many parts of England streams and
canals have been raised above the level of
the surrounding country, and the tunnelling
of the muskrats into the containing banks
has done a considerable amount of damage.

“Ume” : That story of the Island native
hospital assistant who fainted after being
made to insert a hypodermic needle in his
boss (B. 25/l/’33) recalls the case of a
native witness I had to handle in the long
ago. He was a Papuan village constable,
and was more than suspect of complicity in
a raid in his district involving a couple of
murders. Treated as a hostile witness, he
was having a bad time in cross-examination
when he suddenly keeled over and fell bang
to the floor, apparently in a dead faint. H'e
was a big hefty gentleman who only a few
years before had been a leader among a
frankly cannibal people, and by all accounts
a particularly ruthless one—quite the last
person one would expect to faint. However,
he was resuscitated in rather downright
fashion and carried on without any further
histrionics. It is worth noting that in
Sydney courts there have been several cases
of fainting witnesses within the last month,
both men and women. Is it mental sugges-
tion or just theatricalism?
* * «: HI
“1.M.” (Tientsin, China) : Has any Abo.-
liar ever heard of a fungus which grows
out of the head of a caterpillar? It is said
to be found in Australia and M.L. The
M.L. variety is associated with the cater-
pillar Cordycepft robertsii. The grubs on
falling from the tree burrow into the ground,
tail first, the fungus growth shooting out
from the head and attaining a length of from
6in. to 12in. That, however, is hearsay; I’ve
never seen ’em. The Chinese variety, which
I do know, comes from Kiangsu, Szechwan
and Tibet, is known under the name of
“tung-chung-hsia-ts’ao” (meaning winter
worm—summer grass) and is used as a medi-
cine. The fungus growth sometimes attains
a length of two inches, and the roots shoot,
down into the body of the insect, finally caus-
ing its death. The corpse is gathered,
dried, tied into bundles of about one ounce
and is then ready for the market. The
Chinese think very highly of it as a medicine
in the treatment of jaundice and phthisis
and pay up to 80s. or 40s. per pound for
good-quality cargo. It is usually prepared
for use by being boiled with pork; the pork,
soup and the “medicine” itself being taken.
The medicinal properties are compared by
the Chinese to those of ginseng. If the
plant exists in Australia there may be a
possibility of an export trade being built up.

'“Pueblo”: The movement to commem-
orate the memory of Granny Smith, the
Eastwood (Sydney) lady who produced the
apple that carries her name, reminds me
that in Riverside, California, I saw an
orange-tree protected by a spiked railing and
bearing an inscription that it was the first
navel orange and “the father of all the
navel oranges in the world.” At San Diego
(Cal.) the first palm-tree planted over a
century ago by Fra Junipero Serra is still
growing vigorously and bearing at its base
a tablet telling the world its story.

“Homfrey Beale”: The kangaroo that sur-
prised the Methodist congregation of Nar-
rabri (N.S.W.) recently by hopping into
church during the sermon wasn’t the first
wild thing to invade a place of worship.
During a storm at Walgett (N.S.W.)
one Sabbath evening, three emus elec-
trified the Scotchbyterian congregation by
bursting open the insecurely-closed door
and avalanching down the aisle, where
all of them diverted attention from the
pulpit by slipping and skidding. Curi-
ously enough, the birds’ entry was during
a sermon on the need for kindness to
animals. They huddled in a corner
behind the organ, and w T ere there when the
congregation left; meenister lived up to his
teaching by leaving them there and the door
open. Next morning they were gone.
* * * *
“Wandi”: Is a snake-and-goanna cross
a possibility? What looks like such a freak
was killed the other day at Windellama, in
the Goulburn (N.S.W.) district. The oddity
was a brown snake, Bft. long, with a head
like that of Varnanus varius, and one front
leg, 4in. long, also resembling the lizard’s,
except that it had no claws. As a general
rule, snakes and goannas are deadly enemies,
and here crops up one of the great contro-
versial subjects of the bush. It is said that
wherever goannas are found there grows the
dinkum antidote for snakebite. Some enthu-
siasts have placed the reptiles in a small
enclosure, and when casualties had resulted
the clawed gladiator was liberated and fol-
lowed. In every ease lie rushed up a tree,
apparently unconcerhed about his wounds.

With firm resolve and strong.

And all the shed’s worst smells are known,

And treat me as a jest.

Perhaps he looks and grins;

Compared with what the rollers trim,
And pile up in the bins.

Of pride in what he’s shorn;
And e’en the drummer, with a flair
For moccasins an’ scented hair,

Inspect the whole fraternitv
An’ all their props—exceptin’ me
An’ my old rubbish tip.

The man who has the dirty job.

SAVE AND PROFIT
Piling shillings one upon another may be a form of thrift, but it is a
risky method—and unprofitable. There is loss of profit because the
same money, placed in a Commonwealth Savings Bank, would earn
interest. There is risk of loss by fire, by burglary, even by inadvertence,
and, not so obvious but quite definite, there is the risk of temptation
to spend.
The Savings Bank Account is the logical place for your savings, for
there they both accumulate and earn interest. Thus your saving power
is multiplied, your savings become profitable, and you are less tempted
to spend wastefully.

a hero’s role. Judge of his gratification
when on nearing his home the other even-

rising’ from the rear of a neighbor’s house.
To see was to act! Having sounded an
adjacent fire-alarm, he dashed back to the
conflagration. No one about. The glory of
achievement would be his alone.
Rushing up the side walk, he found him-
self confronted with a massive latticed gate
—locked ! A glance at the mass of roses
with which it was crowned convinced him
that climbing was impossible. The grim
circumstances called for drastic measures.
Stepping back, he launched his full weight
against the structure, which collapsed under
the impact, at the same time bringing down
most of the fence. No matter! The owner
could only feel gratitude to one who had
saved his home; perhaps his life.

ANOTHER CRISIS.
London, any old time:
England is seething with indignation over
the ludo Tests. The flagrant use of the
hypnotic-stare theory by Guzzer, the Aus-
tralian, in his match against Buzzer, the
Englishman, at Sydney has rocked the
Empire.
The King has appealed to his people to
remain calm.
Ramsay MacDonald arrived by ’plane
from Lossiemouth this morning, and said:
“Losh, let us do something!” Later he flew
back to finish his interrupted game of golf.
Lord Blymee, chairman of the L.L.L.
(Loyal Ludo Leaguers), has abandoned his
week-end at Slopton-on-Slush and is now
sleeping at the War Office.
In its leading article to-day the “Times”
explains that the hypnotic-stare theory is a
diabolical practice borrowed by Guzzer from
the meaicine-men of the savage tribes of
Bellevue Hill near Sydney.
The Prince of Wales has formally aban-
doned his scarlet shirt and beret as a ges-
ture of disgust. He attended a meet of the

THE PERFECT WIFE.
We have been married for a number of
years, Alan and I, yet I still love him dearly.
Does he still love me? Sometimes I almost
doubt his constancy.
Last night he came home slightly—er—
unsober. As a wife should, I met him with
a radiant smile, and ran to kiss him. He
returned my caress with a punch under the
ear.
Some might have resented this, but I try
not to nag. I merely said quietly “Here’s
your supper, dearest.”
“Struth !” he exclaimed; “saveloys again.
Blast!”
“Yes, love,” I answered as I mopped my
ear with a towel.
Then he threw the casserole-dish —Aunt
Euphemia’s wedding present—at me and I
went “out” for half an hour or so. A marvel-
lously accurate shot, Alan.
I was telephoning the doctor later about
the symptoms of a broken jaw when Alan
said: “Are you going to hang on to that
—- ’phone the whole night.”
Sometimes his tone is quite peevish. I
made way for him, and to my surprise his
manner changed. He spoke gently—l had
almost used the word “cooed” —to someone
whom he called “Maisie.” He was making
a luncheon appointment with Maisie.
Am I losing Alan’s love? But there—what
a silly I am ! Perhaps I expect too much. I

know that deep down he loves me. He told
me so in 1908 and I know he wrnuld not
deceive me. Whatever his faults may be,
Alan is a gentleman.

_A woman can still wear her “godets”
without feeling as if she’s fallen out of the
front rank. Flounces flutter on soft, crushy
muslins and washing silks, and after the
struggle to be placed high up, they
descended to the hem of the garment, whence
they are again climbing ambitiously to the
knee; also, they crisp and crinkle on shoul-
ders and sleeves. You can’t have too much
pleating, and goffering, and frilling and
ruffling about; to reach the present fussy
ideal a woman must look as much like a
French hen as her money will run to.
Blouses are not possible without several
miles of narrow lace meandering over them.
“Is my hat straight?” won’t be the burning
question this season, as the great object of
millinery to-day is to sit on the head at a
rakish angle and be adorned with a highly-
colored assortment of fantastic raggery.—

THE CURSE OF THE COUNTRY.
“Oh. yes, I moved into town last week.
I liked livin’ out the back of the Park right
enough; but I used to come in here now and
again for a nip and a yarn, and some of the
boys d propose a game of nap till 12 o’clock,
no later. At 1 o’clock we’d say ‘We’ll make it
four-nap at 2,’ and at 3 o’clock we would
make it four-nap ; and as soon as Kitty was
took I’d hurry downstairs, and it give me
a creep to hear the key gratin’; and when I
sneaks out, blow me if there wasn’t always
a swarm of them darned little sparrers sit-
tin’ in the road waitin’ for me; and they’d
start chirrupin’ and chirrupin’ and chirrup-
in’, and runnin’ along peerin’ at me, and
talkin’ to themselves; and down at the
corner another lot, twitterin’ and twitterin’
and twitterin’, you never heard the like;
and I’m hardly inside the Park before there’s
four or five black-and-white birds, peewits
they call ’em, screechin’ out ‘p ee-whit, pee-
whit,’ the most unearthly sound you ever
did hear, and me feelin’ like a man wot’s
got buried alive and rooted himself up to
a daylight he don’t recognise; and mol*e
sparrers everywhere, chirpin’ and chirpin’,
and tellin’ each other to look at me stealin’
home; and just as I’m tappin’ so gentle
at the shutters, cuss me if five or six of
them jackasses doesn’t begin laughin’ fit to
kill themselves, and rousin’ up the whole
house; and after I gets in and gives the
old woman two pound to buy a new bonnet,
I’ll be hanged if she don’t buy one. with a
dead sparrer on top of it. I’m glad I shifted,
anyway. Them sparrers is the curse of the
country.”— Leslie Oakes | 11/12/’97],

TEACHING A FARMER.
I was up at Glen Innes last summer and
called on a farmer whose crops had been in-
jured by rain and frost. And, in order to
hearten the poor fellow, I pointed out that
it was only a question of time before his
occupation would be gone.
rt You> see,” I explained, “we already know
all the constituent parts of a cereal. When
chemical science can form a synthesis of
these, food products will be directly derived
from the soil in laboratories.”
“Now, just you clear!” said lie. “I won’t
have none of you blanky book-agents about
my place. Git, you broody German!”.
A book-agent! I w T as hurt.
“My dear sir,” I said, “you misapprehend
me.”
“Ye’re a bloomin’ liar !” cried Wapstraw.
“I never laid a finger on yer! But if yer’ll
put up your blessed ’ands I’ll”
I, with some presence of mind, hastened
to soothe the patient by applying whisky,
and when he had relapsed into his normal
state of tranquil idiocy I placed the fence
between us and bored in again. I wrestled
with the matter, put on the strangle-hold
and threw it repeatedly. I appealed to him
as a man of intelligence and enterprise (the
poor devil never tried to grow anything but
wheat and spuds) to try to realise the
imminence of the danger that menaced the
backbone of this great country.. In the course
.of half an hour I used up enough brain-tissue
to overstock the N.S.W. junior Bar for 18
months.
“What will become of you,” I cried quiver-
ingly, “when we get a week’s supply of bread
by dropping into the chemist’s for a penn’orth
of wheat-extract; or when a beef pellet swal-
lowed too quickly gives a swagman acute
indigestion for a fortnight?”
The cocky regarded me with a sadly criti-
cal look in his little grey eyes, and sniffed
despairingly at intervals.
I pushed the question. I showed that
agricultural lands would lose all value; that,
if crops grew of themselves, they wouldn’t
pay to reap, and that wheat would be down
to a halfpenny a bushel. And all the time
I rang “synthesis” into him. I’d slung it
at him 30 or 40 times and was just butting
through again when the cocky spoke.
_ “That’s all blanky fine,” he said. “But
s’pose you sows your gory sinisis, and s’pose
we gets no blooming rain and she don’t
come up, what?”
It was nearly sundown, and I pushed on
toward Glen Innes.
[3l/7/’97.] Cecil Poole.
Down South there is a tall, wide-eyed
barrister who may be often seen striding
rapidly along thoroughfares, each stride
covering at least sft. of space, a gaunt
whirlwind, generally armed with a stick or
umbrella, and having short pants that ,show
a good 4in. of socked shinbone between their
leg-ends and the tops of his boots. He once
accepted a job to serve a man in the country
with a writ. To save train-fare and pocket
it, along with the mileage allowance, he
walked to the servee, about 120 miles,
served the writ, and walked back to the
city. There lie discovered that he had
served the writ on the wrong man : the son,
instead of the father! Vexed, but un-

daunted, he got a copy of the writ, and
walked all the way again! This same- joker
once wanted to join the “mounted infantry.”
Attending at the barracks, he overheard the
major-general then in ' command swearing.
“How shocking! Do the men swear, too ?”
he asked of the officials* with whom he was
treating. “Could it —ah —be arranged that
they will not swear in my presence? I do
not like swearing.” This request being art-
fully fenced with, he proceeded: “Must all
the members of the regiment ride?” “Yes,
of course.” “Well, I do not ride. Could it
—ah —be arranged that I could walk? I
am a very quick walker, and I am sure that
I could keep up with the others. Could
that be managed? I do not like horses.”
Negotiations snapped, carrot-like, at this
request. [IS/9/’97.J
Ever drive a traction engine in the back-
blocks? Oh, it’s gay. Taking her down from
Syaney to Cootamundra we met a man on
horseback; and, as usual, the horse shied. The
rider, as much astonished as his beast, tied
up to a fence, and came to inspect us. As
he did so the horse dropped with a thud and
remained motionless. “Your moke is dead,”
says my mate. H'e looked round, then stared
at the engine again, and we left him staring.
Further on we wanted to take a short cut
through a station, but were
forbidden by the boundary-
rider, till we threatened to
get a map and open up every
road on the run, when he
yielded so far as to show us
a green line of timber, which
he told us to “foller right
along.” We did, and I
wouldn’t like to say how
many fences we went
through—so easily that you
wouldn’t know you touched
anything. We camped that
night near a dam, and the
squatter rode up to warn us
against taking any water.
We’ kept him on the other
side of the engine for fear
he’d see the hose pulsing up
and down like a snake in
the grass. By the time he’d
finished the tank was full,
so we cheerfully agreed not
to take a drop out of his
dam tank. One morning, in
passing through Coota, with
three loaded waggons, we
turned a corner sharply and
brought away some fencing
and part of a house. We
didn’t know anything about it until we came
back in the evening, when “our attention
was drawn to the matter” as politely as the
Irish blood of Mrs. O’Something would allow.
We made money when the drought came, and
the language of the weatherbound bullockies,
as -we passed by, was crimson. We were
taking one load across the river at Booligal,
but the bridge was rickety, and the authori-
ties refused to allow the engine to cross, so
we had to camp. The bullockies were cheer-
ful, for although there was a good crossing
the water was deep and would put out our
fire if we tried to cross. About midnight we
got up full steam, detached the waggons,
fastened one end of a rope to a tree on the
other side, and fixed the other on to our
winding-drum. Turning on steam, we began
to wind ourselves over the crossing. About
half-way over the fires were out, but there
was enough steam in the steam-chest to drag
us half-way up the other bank—where we
relit our furnace and drew up to the top
Then, passing a line over the bridge, we
pulled the waggons across, and waited for
day to dawn on the profane bullockies.

“Australia’s most successful aboriginal
mission station,” writes “M.D.” to The
Bulletin from the Far West, “is that con-
trolled by Spanish monks at New Norcia.
Many years ago the monks' settled in wliat
was then a most inhospitable region, on land
given them by the Government conditionally
upon their improving the condition of the
natives. After overcoming tremendous difficul-
ties, they have civilised large numbers of the
aborigines, and with their assistance are mak-
ing fertile a big tract of the wilderness.
They have large areas of land in high culti-
vation, and are possessed of considerable
flocks and herds ranking among the best-
bred in the province. They have a flour-mill
and a tannery, make their own
clothes and boots, do their own.
blacksmithing and carpentering —
in fact, make all that is possible
for their requirements. They have
splendid gardens and vineyards,
and from a distance tlie mission
looks like a village. The brothers
take pride in showing visitors their
old-time agricultural implements—
among them a wooden plough with
a wooden mouldboard —and their
first dwelling-house, still religious-
ly cared for, and surrounded by
buildings that would not disgrace
a modern town; also, their school
would compare favorably with
those of the State. The married
people live in rows of comfortable
cottages, and the grown-up males
and females who are single live in
separate dwellings—apart. It is a
pleasant scene on a summer’s even-
ing to see the mission residents
sitting under shady trees watching
the young people dance to the
music of a band of wind instru-
ments, played by aborigines, who
would make a small fortune in the
streets of the Bast, were it possible and
desirable for them to go on tour. Eccle-
siastically, the mission is an abbey, and its
head—the venerable Bishop Salvador-—is the
lord abbot, and, in imitation of the abbeys
of old, all wayfarers who desire it are
entertained. Those who stay for the night
are given a sitting-room and a bedroom, and
a bottle of good wine with meals; and, if
they have horses, these are cared forj no
remuneration whatever being accepted.”

One of the first things the Caringtons did
on reaching London, after their term of Gov-

you are very strong indeed, my dear,” said

A very successful evangelist who had pre-
dicted the end of the world and fixed the
date of the resurrection, and was working
large crowds of people into a state of frenzy,
visited Ballarat, and presently had a big
percentage of the population preparing for
its end and packing up for the voyage over
Jordan. Business became bad, particularly
amongst drapers, it bping held by the women
that existing styles were going right out in
favor of diaphanous robes and feathers. At
this juncture a Bridge-street draper hung
this legend on the outer wall: “Bargains!
Bargains! Bargains!! Grand Clearing Sale
in View of the Resurrection ! Cerements a
Specialty.” It brought business back. The
last trump would not draw the average
woman from a bargain. [lB/9/’97.]

MANLY LAGOON.
Where the long beach runs to its far north
end,
And the sandways cease at the north rock's
feet,
And the foam is fiercer, the waves, more
fleet,
Lies a low lagoon that the high tides blend
With their billows’ brine as they come and
go;
And the ways of its water are smooth
and slow.
Though the salt waves weep through it night
or noon,
Yet its mother-stream from the backland
sweeps;
With a sighless swaying her water creeps
O’er the inward edge of the slow lagoon,
And her tender bosom bears life and grace
To the ways of the lake in the sea-girt
place.
In the summer dusk when the moon rides
fast,
Ere the sunset’s burning has faded quite,
And the seas fall eastward in liquid light,
On the sea-lake’s face such a gleam is cast
That it lies on the earth in its golden
glows
Like the quivering leaf of a heavenly rose.
All the seas to the east move silver sweet
In a floating shroud by the moonbeams
made,
All the westward skylands their light have
laid
On the lake that lies at the sunset’s feet;
And between the shroud and the golden
lands
Is a narrowing pathway of surf-swept
sands.
But in winter eves when the sun is not,
And the moon is buried in mist and cloud.
And the sea, unlit, is a moaning shroud
For the bones of the dead that the sea-
waves rot,
On. the narrow shore between sea and lake
Boils an ocean of sea-foam and billow-
break.

In the far sad sky not a rose is blown,
Not a fleeting gleam in the grey-bound
west,
Not a mirrored glow on the lakelet’s
breast,
And no light where the waves round the
north crags moan ;
But the cold sea creeps on the narrow
sands,
And the shroud has enveloped the golden
lands.

THRILLING HEALTH
THROUGH YEAST!
Half-Sick, Tired, Weak People Find
I 1 hat Truly “Yeast is Life ”
Probably no scientific discovery has caused
such attention as that of the importance of
vitamines in our food. Research has shown
that much of the prevalent ill-health, “half-
health,” pain and weakness is due to the
lack of these vital elements. Many leading
health specialists recommend yeast, which
is especially rich in encrgy-and-health-giving
vitamines. Good results have been obtained
by plain yeast, but in no case do the results
compare to those obtained from Cream of
Yeast, which is the super-active yeast, made
more valuable by combination with other
valuable medicinal agents. Men and women
who have tried Cream of Yeast report a
startlingly quick return to thrilling health
and vigor—headaches, indigestion, nervous-
ness, depression, tired feeling, gone in a
few minutes; sallow complexions enlivened
to healthy glowing color; pimples and black-
heads cleared —all in quick time ! Many
who were once forced to rely on Aspirins to
keep going now find Cream of Yeast not
only far superior, but actually cheaper,
results considered. Chemists say the wonder-
ful efficacy of Cream of Yeast, with its
surprisingly small cost, is converting thou-
sands.*

REINFORCED IRRIGATION.
“N. P. Kay”,: gome years ago I experi-
mented in reinforcing irrigation water with
plant food prior to irrigating. Results, par-
ticularly in the case of irrigating in the
summer, prior to ploughing, were definitely
good; unfortunately, my lease of the place
expired before the experiments were com-
plete, and no opportunity has since pre-
itself for the work to be finalised.
Ihe method I employed was to suspend a
mixture of equal parts of sulphate of
ammonia and potash sulphate in sugar-bags
at the take-off, allowing 561 b. of the mix-
ture per acrfe, no matter whether the water
applied was Sin. or 6in. The trial with
super, was not a success, for the fertiliser
pugged and did not dissolve. A better result
was obtained by throwing the super, into
the main race, but this was discarded in
tavor of sowing with the seed.
The idea is now passed on to the M.O.L.
with the suggestion that a trial be made
wherever possible. It is granted that
summer irrigation, as practised along the
Murray, presents difficulties in that the
growing season at this stage is too far
advanced; but in dry years— i.e., in the case
of early irrigation—it is possible that this
method of manuring will reduce costs, not
only directly through reducing labor, but in-
directly by increasing the yield and quality
cr °P Per acre. Of course, the soluble
fertilisers mentioned are the only ones
worthy of trial, because bonedust and the
owing to their insolubility in water,
would be practically useless.
Irrigating with water reinforced with
plant food prior to ploughing has possibili-
ties. Irrigating the young crop in a similar
manner practically amounts to feeding the
crop at the critical period of growth. It
is a more economical method than applying
the solid fertiliser by hand.
WHEY AND LINSEED.
“J.W.W.”: Large numbers of Gippsland
larms which had been abandoned in the boom
years, mainly because farmers’ sons had
been attracted by big wages to the cities,
have returned to production; and almost
everywhere in the State (Vie.) pasture im-
provement is in progress. In most cases
chief dependence is being put on butter. But
that is often a mistake. In many of the
dairy herds I have found cows more
adapted for cheese- than for butter-produc-
tion. There are still, after considerable cull-
ing many cows not very high in butter-fat
test but exceptionally high in their yield of
the protein elements and milk-sugar, and
these cows should be producing cheese" in-
stead of butter. With such animals about
-lb. ,of cheese can be made from the milk
required to make lib. of butter, and the
price of cheese is a good deal more than
half butter price.
I hear someone object that you lose the
skim-milk for the calves. But the whey from
cheese-making is a very satisfactory calf food
it a little linseed meal or fish oil is added
to it as a balance. . The best plan is to grow
an acre or so of linseed. The seed .boiled
into a mucilage and mixed in the whey, with
a little salt added, makes as good a calf-
tood as any skim-milk.
“CULL, BREED AND FEED.”
“W.D.Mc”: The mixture “Alf Alpha” (B.
H/l/ 33) suggests for a 10001 b. cow is a
very good one, but, except in isolated cases,
it is not an economic proposition. According
to my reckoning, it would cost 12s. 4d. a
week: 1401 b. shandy chaff, at 4s. per hun-
dredweight, 55.; 701 b. lucerne hay. at ss. per
hundredweight, 3s. 6d.; 211 b. crushed oats, at
3s. per bushel, Is. 6d.; 71b. linseed meal, at
2d. per pound, Is. 2d.; 211 b. bran, at £5 per
ton, Is. 2d. These are wholesale prices
(the dairyman usually has to pay more),
and nothing is added for rail carriage or
cartage. And the revenue derived from
Strawberry, as stated by “Alf Alpha,” is at
most 10s. 6d. a week—three gallons a day
at 6d. Or three gallons of 3.5 milk will make
about lilb. of butter, which at Is. per pound
(more than the market price)' = Bs. 9d. per
week. In effect, a loss of Is. lOd. in the
case of whole milk, of 3s. 7d. if the milk
is made into butter. And nothing for the
dairyman, not even tucker.
What is the remedy ? There is only one
thing to be done; grow the feed or get out.
Experts (who never did it for a living)
.advise the dairyman to make silage. I tried
it more than 30 years ago and found it was
a dud. First you have to grow your crop,
then cut it, pick it up, throw it down, put It
through the chaffcutter (unchaffed silage' is
an abomination), blow or elevate it into
the silo and put weight on top; and it takes
a sight longer to get it out than to get it in.
And when you have gone to all this labor
and expense you will find out that one ton
of good oaten chaff or clover hay is worth
three tons of silage, and is much easier to
handle and store. The only time silage is
any good is in a drought. If I were a young-
man going in for dairying again I would
concentrate on oaten and clover grass, hay or
lucerne, and grow green fodder crops that
can be cut or grazed. Grow them on well-
worked fallow, manure heavily, and it will be
a very dry year in which you do not get a good
cut, with a fair second cut. With the money
that you would have spent building silos or
pits and making silage you can buy bran
and linseed meal, and Strawberry will
respond to the treatment. A big barn or
hay shed, no matter how roughly it is built, is
one of the best assets a dairyman can have,
as every load he puts in is safe from the
weather. “Cull, breed and feed” should be
every dairyman’s slogan, and the greatest of
these is “feed.”
DAIRY-CATTLE IMPROVEMENT.
“Strawberry”: The Queensland dairying-
industry is deeply interested in the Dairy-
Cattle Improvement Act, which came into
force on January 12. It was the result of
an intensive survey of Queensland dairy
herds by the Agricultural Department and
was drafted after a conference with some
of the leading representatives of the indus-
try. The Act aims at the all-round improve-
ment of dairy herds and contains many
drastic proposals, which are to be reviewed
at a meeting to be held in Brisbane in
February ; officials of the Herd Book societies
and the Royal National Association will be
among the delegates. Opinion is by no means
generally favorable to the measure and
amendments are likely to be put forward.
The Act requires a license for every bull
over 12 months. It will cost ss. and
expire on December 31, being renewable by
January 21. Bulls for beef-breeding are not
included in the provisions, but the owner
must take out a certificate of exemption from
the department. Fines are provided for fail-
ing to license bulls, and inspectors may in-
spect any bull anywhere and demand pro-
duction of the license or exemption certifi-
cate. Penalties are provided for obstructing
inspectors, and these have power to order
any bull found to be. damaging neighbors’
property, discovered to be diseased, or con-
sidered worthless by the inspector to be
destroyed or emasculated at the inspector's
discretion. The sections containing the itali-
cised words are strongly objected to by many
dairymen, who consider the power placed in
the hands of an inspector, who may be a
mere political appointee, far too drastic, and
likely to open the way to “irregularities.”
Results are not likely to accrue from the
new legislation until after a lapse of two
years at least. However, the Act anticipates;
bulls which are not well grown, according
to age and season, sound of constitution and
manifestly showing dairy characteristics two
years after the commencement of the Act
are to be refused a license, emasculated and
destroyed. It is admitted that the measure
contains many excellent provisions. E’or one
thing, there is insistence on herd-testing, a
matter grossly neglected in Queensland.
POLLED CATTLE IN QUEENSLAND.
“Ruddy Neil”: “Beefo” (B. 18/l/’33)
says polled cattle in Queensland cannot forage
for themselves under drought conditions and
this has been their undoing. During my
wanderings through the cattle areas I have
seen the natural poley living hard, particu-
larly the Aberdeen-Angus. The acclimatised
animal has mastered his yo-yo, and can fend
for himself just as effectively as a liorney. His
modus operandi is different, that is all.
Where a Shorthorn or Hereford will labor
to get mulga top into contact with his mas-
ticating machinery, a sophisticated poley will
centre the sapling or tree between his' fore-
legs and walk it down to eating distance in
half the time and more effectively.
No, the principal difficulty with the black
poll—l cannot speak so authoritatively
about the red —is that on the big cattle
stations of the west and north-west his ten-
dency to wildness is pronounced, and makes
handling difficult. Freedom from daily or
frequent contact with man creates a ‘ ten-
dency to go the whole hog when he gets to
the wide spaces. That is really the only
shortcoming of the breed.
“Rocky”: Shorthorns and Herefords are
the ideal beef strains for tropical Queens-
land. Herefords are already well established
as a polled breed, and the polled Shorthorn
is becoming popular. The polled bulls are
already used on several well-known proper-
ties in the Clermont district. W. R. Tin-
dale, of Monteagle, got his first bulls from
Areot, near Stanthorpe; the owner of that
station started the herd from a freak polled
Durham bull which happened along in his
stud about 30 years ago. This bull was
mated with pure Canning Downs heifers, and
the first cross resulted in 40 to 50 p.c. of
polled calves. The heifers were then crossed
back on their sire. Later polled Durhams
were imported from Maoriland and the stud
is now well established. Tindale’s experi-
ence with some of the bulls was that the
first cross with good Durham cows produced
up to 50 p.c. of polled calves, and it is
evident that anyone who will give this breed-
ing of polled cattle attention for about six
years will have established by then practi-
cally a polled herd. Much can be accom-
plished by selection and judicious breeding.
MINERAL DEFICIENCY OF PASTURES.
“Yeoman”: The mineral content of pas-
tures and the value of a particular pasture
with regard to the mineral nutrition of the
grazing animal depend upon the species of
plants, stage of growth of plants, climatic
conditions and nature of the soil. Legumes
are generally richer in minerals than the
grasses. This applies particularly to lime
and sulphur. On the other hand, the ash
of grasses is higher in phosphates compared
with legumes. Accordingly, the value of a
pasture of different types of plants is obvious.
Generally, young vigorous plants are rich-
est in minerals. As herbage reaches maturity
the mineral contents progressively decline
because certain of the minerals, particularly
phosphate and nitrogen, migrate to the seed.
Climatic conditions also seriously affect the
mineral content of pastures (for example,
phosphate absorption by plants is seriously
reduced .during periods of drought), and so
does the nature of the soil. Any' deficiency
of any particular mineral or minerals in the
soil is reflected in the quality of the herbage.
This is why so many pastures respond with
such marked effect to top-dressing. Not
infrequently improvement of breed, includ-
ing increased rate of growth, is associated
with an improvement in the pasture due to
top-dressing.
The mineral deficiency of a pasture may
be so serious that actual disease results, or
of such a degree that the feeding value of
the pasture is affected, with lower animal
production. Diseases attributed to the defi-
ciency of either phosphorus or calcium in
pastures are common in all States of Aus-
tralia. Coastal disease cripples, pica (de-
praved appetite) and changes in the skele-
are results of phosphorus deficiency. So
is “dry bible,” which leads to bone-chewing.
It is important to note that our saltbushes
—the standby of owners of millions of
sheep and cattle —have a marked beneficial
effect on the health of stock. They are rich
in phosphate and lime.
Diseases resulting from mineral deficien-
cies in pastures may be prevented by either
direct administration of the required
minerals to the animal through licks, etc.,
or indirectly by enriching the pastures by
top-dressing. Theiler strikingly demonstrated
in South Africa the value of feeding bone-
meal to stock depastured on phosphate-defi-
cient country. Young growing cattle, fed
3oz. of bonemeal per head per day, made an
increase in weight of 4451 b. Similar cattle
grazing the same pasture, but denied access
to the bonemeal, put on only 1501 b. in weight
in the same time. Still application of
mineral fertilisers to the soil is the better
method. Top-dressing not only enriches the
pasture with regard to mineral nutrients, but
improves its feeding value in other ways.
Indeed, the carrying capacity of pastures is
frequently doubled by top-dressing with super.
PRAIRIE GRASS.
“A.C.8.” : Prairie grass is a feed that is
not fully appreciated by many N.S.W. dairy-
men. On the Manning I have seen cows
taken from good pasturage to a prairie pad-
dock increase their cream one-third. Rich
loamy soil with abundant rainfall is ideal
for prairie, which will stand heavy stocking
when thoroughly established. Feed it right
off; spell the paddock until growth is good;
then feed off again. Here lies one of the
advantages of having a number of small
paddocks instead of a couple of large ones.
At the end of the season prairie should be
allowed to make its seed and thus renew
itself.
Prairie goes well in combination with
lucerne, but must be .spelled when eaten
down. It gives good feed during the period
when the lucerne is resting. Autumn is a
favorable time to start either lucerne or
prairie. In districts such as the Dorrigo,
prairie gives capital results in conjunction
with paspalum, but not in the .same paddock.
Unlike paspalum, prairie does not seem to
coarsen with age; it remains palatable.
KIKUYU GRASS.
“Hortus”: Dry-district farmers would do
well to try this drought-resistant grass. The
peculiarity about kikuyu is that It fails to
set seed anywhere except in its native home.
It, however, is spread easily bj means of
rooted cuttings. It produces vigorous sur-
face and underground runners with roots
at the nodes, and pieces of these runners
(underground) with two roots are sufficient
for planting. The best method is to plough
shallow furrows about 3ft. apart, drop the
pieces in the latter about every 3ft., and
cover with two or three inches of soil. If
this is done in spring, the shoots will be
noticeable in about a week.
Kikuyu is a rapid grower, and will thrive
on many different classes of soil, growing to
a height of 3ft. under favorable conditions.
Although heavy frosts kill the flag, the root
system persists, and sends out new shoots
in the spring following. One good point in
its favor is that it will smother weed growth,
even nut-grass. As it is so persistent, it
should not be planted in an area likely to be
turned later into cultivation. There is, how-
ever, no risk of its spreading any distance,
as it does not seed. All classes of stock find
kikuyu nutritious and palatable, and it is par-
ticularly good for milk production. Although
chiefly a summer grass, its season is longer
thftn that of paspalum ; in fact, it could be
profitably used in conjunction with the latter.
It “mats” in time like paspalum, and then
the same treatment must be meted out to
the crop as is given to paspalum. In South
Africa, white clover has been found to grow
well with kikuyu.
SUBSIDISED HORSE-BREEDING.
“Yarraman” : Alone among the Dominions,
Canada has for years given State encour-
agement to horse-breeding. The results of
this policy are now proving its worth. Cana-
dian farmers, sorely stricken by the world
depreciation of agricultural prices, have
found the cost of tractors and fuel too heavy
and are returning in large numbers to the
horse. They are fortunate in that the Gov-
ernment’s policy has provided cheap and
adequate supplies for them, in addition to
a surplus which is being eagerly snapped up
in the U.S.A.
In the past the Canadian Government
encouraged breeding by subsidising breeders’
clubs utilising approved stallions. It has
now added to this a system of direct pay-
ments to stallion owners for each mare bred,
up to 50 mares, from stallions which have
passed Government inspection. According to
a report issued by the Department of Agri-
culture, five dollars is paid for each mare,
and last'year over 500 owners benefited by
this bounty, the total paid out amounting to
122.000 dollars.
Here in Australia, once renowned for the
quality of its horses of all types, the States
and the Federal Government have done little
to encourage breeding'. Certainly Queensland
and Victoria have legislated against unsound
and otherwise unsuitable stallions, and N. S.
Wales, for its part, has established a Clydes-
dale stud. But the results of that enterprise
has been disappointing,' because of the in-
ferior quality of the sires utilised. The stand-
ard of the mares running at the stud calls,
for the introduction of stallions of undeniable
breeding quality, .not only for the production
of farm working stock, but to enable the
supply to private draught-liorse breeders of
colts for stud purposes.
TWO GRAZIERS’ RETURNS.
“Golightly”: My aim is to produce fat
lambs; my neighbor plumps for the wool clip.
Here’s how we get on. Neighbor’s wool comes
mostly from young, dry, good-quality merino
sheep; the clip averaged 111 b. per head and
average auction price was 9d. per pound.
Thus his sheep cut Bs. 3d. per head at the
wool saleroom. His merino lambs are almost
unsaleable as stores, and are overstocking
the farm.
My clip comes wholly from ewes (80 per
cent, of them rearing lambs) which were
selected for plain bodies, with some come-
back and some crossbred. They averaged 81b.
per head, which sold at 7Jd. all round—ss.
per head at the wool store. My lambs were
by Dorset rams, and were below average this
season owing to unsatisfactory pastures in
June-July. They were sold at Homebush,
Sydney, and netted Bs. per head on the farm,
or 6s. 4d. per head per ewe.
Bearing in mind that where the clip alone
is the consideration more sheep may be
risked per acre, there is not much difference
in these returns. I am dissatisfied with my
prices and results, but I hate to be over-
stocked.
TO POTATO-GROWERS.
“R.X.8.”: Knocking around Sydney’s
potato markets, anyone who knows the game

Use strong and clean bags. See that each

grade and fill with only that grade, and let
each bag have a distinctive form of brand-
ing. It doesn't matter what design of brand
you adopt so long as it will be recog-

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Prescriptions used for injections for (1)
milk fever, and (2) stomach staggers m
dairy cattle? —4017. . .
(i) A solution of calcium chloride is in-
jected intravenously as a treatment for milk
fever, but as this injection is extremely dan-
gerous in the hands of inexperienced persons,
its use cannot be recommended. (2) Various
treatments and injections have been pre-
scribed for the disease known as stomach
staggers, but so far none has proved effec-
tive in all cases.
A Vic. dairy-farmer who makes Ivis own
butter tells me that from a can of cream, on
which a factory would credit him with 40 lb.
of butter-fat, he gets 5 61 b. of butter. Taking
this to be correct, is the 17 p.c. overrun
allowed to the butter factories included in
this, or is it allowed them over and above
the 40 p.c. they don’t pay you for? When
butter was 82s. a hundredweight in London,
our manufacturer paid us B d. per pound
butter-fat. If 40 lb. of butter-fat make 56/5.
of butter, that 82s. should be worth 1155.,
plus exchange. —3B72.
Vic. butter must contain at least 80 p.c. of
butter-fat. 49£lb. of butter would be the larg-
est amount that could be made from cream
containing 401 b. of fat if the composition of
the butter is to be within the limits prescribed
by law. Dairy butter sometimes contains
well over 20 p.c. of moisture, and that may
account for the large yield of butter some-
times made from cream churned on farms.
The maker would be liable to prosecution.
Butter factories are limited to 22 p.c. over-
run. This means that only 1221 b. of butter
can be made from 1001 b. of fat, and any
excess of this amount must be paid back to
the suppliers. Butter factories pay a
levy of lfd. per pound on butter manufac-
tured in order to provide a bonus of 3d. per
pound on butter exported; this has the effect
of raising the local price. No levy is paid
on farm-produced butter, the makers of
which receive the benefit of the higher price
and so unfairly compete with the factory.
I am running cattle on a large unimproved
place at Gosford ( N.S.W. ) where top-dressing
is impracticable, and think that the cattle are.
in need of lime, as all this district is lime-
deficient. Would it he possible to supply, it
in lick form, and, if so, could ' you furnish
me with a recipe for a good, all-round lick
containing lime? If the lick is impracticable
would top-dressing a small portion, to which
the cattle all have access, supply the want,
and would it need to be harrowed in or just
broadcast on the grass? What is the best
time to apply it? —3791.
Lime may be used in a lick, but is not
such a suitable means of supplying calcium
to stock as sterilised bonemeal (calcium phos-
phate). A useful cattle lick can be prepared
by mixing 25 to 50 p.c. sterilised bonemeal
with the balance of common salt. As to top-
dressing, although the lime and fertiliser
will give better results if harrowed in on
the land, it is not absolutely necessary to do
so. The best time to apply is in March or
April, using half a ton of lime per acre once
every three years, and lewt. superphosphate
per acre every year or every second year.
How to rid a beehive of wax moths? —

First scrape all propolis from upper and

over each set of combs a piece of cloth about
lOin. square—doubled—and over this pour
one tablespoon of carbon bisulphide. Cover
the super with two thicknesses of newspaper
and repeat with as many supers as have to
be treated, placing one super on tqp of the
other. Carbon bisulphide is highly inflam-
mable, so work out of doors and away from
any form of naked light. Supers that are
lightly infested with moth may also be
cleaned up by placing them on top of strong
colonies of Italian bees.
Correct amount of strychnine in mixing
pollard baits for rabbits? How should the
strychnine be mixed with the pollard? —

Sulphate of strychnine should be mixed

milk and rubbed into a very fine powder
before mixing it with the bait. Use loz. or
loz. of sulphate of strychnine for every 31b.
of pollard.

How to stop the suckering of silver poplars

We know of nothing that will prevent
them from suckering; even if the trees are
removed suckers will probably show up for
some time afterwards. As the silver poplars
are apparently doing well, it is probable
that Populus deltoidea (the cottonwood or
Carolina poplar) or Populus nigra pyrami-
dnlis (the Lombardy poplar) would do well
also. These are quick growers and do not

HINTS FOB THE FARM. ,
“Cockyson”: A bone stuck in a beast’s
throat can sometimes be dislodged by pushing
against it carefullv with a broom-handle, the
rounded 1 end, ’ being nsed. The
head should be raised or drawn back, accord-
i ne to whether the beast is on its feet or
lyfng down, so that its throat may form a
straight passage.
“.Tumbuck”: Arsenical preparations for re-
pelling the attacks of blowflies are more or
less effective but thev’re risky to use at
times, espedally sheep thi are badly
blown Castor oil (two parts) and kerosene
(one part) will keep flies away, and the
“llllni-mnnTif” • lucerne should be gar-
or four days, as “Minthall” (B. 18/l/’B3)
says. The vagaries of the weather control
the length of time it should left in the
paddock In very hot weather I cut in the
morning and cart in in the afternoon, other-
wise I would lose much of the leaf and
considerable weight.
“Sylvester” : I don’t agree with “Beady”
(B IS/l/’33) who advocates a sledge-
hammer for splitting timber. A few years
ago a Cairns (N.Q.) man was skewered by
a splinter that flew from a wedge under a
sledgehammer and lost his life. TJiere have
been other cases. If there is a mate potter-
ing about he runs the most risk.
“Gumblegubbin” : Some farmers who have
cars use the vehicles as driving power for

“Wandi” : Where a gutter crosses a farm
road,, and filling it would block water from
running away, drop m a small stiaight

Information Sought.
How to prevent rain entering the mag-
neto of a motor-cycle? —4o9l.
Modern magnetos are well protected, but
rain is apt to trickle down the liigli tension
wire, and may penetrate to the terminal. To
prevent this wrap the end of the exposed
wiring with insulating tape or cut a hole in
a tyre patch and thread the wire through.

sporting prints? (2) Who was Caldecott?
(3) Titles of books illustrated by him?- —
4089.
(1) 1880 to. 1885 approximately. (2)
Randolph Caldecott was born at Chester in
1846. He was a bank clerk before taking
to illustration for a profession. Later lie
became a distinguished ornithologist and ex-
hibited oil paintings, water-colors and model-
ling in plaster and metal at the Royal
Academy and the Grosvenor Gallery. (3)
Washington Irving's “Bracebridge Hall” and
Christmas,” “The Great Panjandrum,”
"Babes in the Wood,” “The Harz Moun-
tains,” “North Italian Folk” and “Breton
Folk.” A series of 16 picture-books were
made by him and had tremendous popu-
larity. “Foxhunting,” written and illus-
trated by bim, was probably the most suc-
cessful of his publications.

sion continue on taking up permanent resi-
dence in Australia? (2) Would such a pen-
sion be subject to deductions? (3) Any
benefits from the prevailing rate of exchange?
—3965.
(1) Yes. (2) Not in Britain on account
of payment in Australia, but it might be
taxed. (3) The benefit of exchange is
added.
Difference in meaning between “ physics”
and “physiology” ? —4660.
The two words had once the same mean-
ing. Now “physics” refers to the properties
of matter and energy in inorganic nature,
and “physiology” to the functions and pheno-
mena of living beings.
(1) What are grounds for divorce in
Victoria, and are they the same as in other
States? (2) Time usually occupied for
lodging of petition to granting of decree
3999 What does decree nisi signify? —
(1) Adultery by wife ; adultery, with deser-

excuse; habitual drunkenness, coupled to
cruelty by husband and leaving wife with-
out means of support, or, in wife’s case,
neglecting her domestic duties or rendering
herself unfit to perform them; commuted
capital sentence or penal servitude for
serious crimes, and repeated short terms of
imprisonment where the husband has left
his wife without means of support; attempts
to murder, and assaults with intent to inflict
grievous bodily harm, or repeated assaults
and beatings. In Queensland and Tasmania,
but not in Victoria, insanity is a ground
for divorce. (2) There is no limit. It
depends on where the case is placed on the
list, the time taken in the hearing, length
of the defence and other circumstances. (3)
Every decree for a divorce is in Ahe first
instance a decree nisi , that is to say, a
decree which will be made absolute unless
within a stated time cause is shown w'hy it
should not be so made.
(1) Is there a clinic in Sydney where 1
could get my dog's teeth attended to? (2)
He also has a wart under the lower eyelid
{outside), ivhich is attached to the skin by
a piece as thick as a pin. How can I get
rid of it? —3945.
(1) The veterinary school at Sydney Uni.
will attend to the dog’s teeth free or for a
very small fee. (2) Take a pair of sharp
scissors and cut it off. Bleeding will be
negligible.
I am going to Western Samoa to take up
a position. What income tax will I have
to pay while there? —4065.
If you spend six months or more of the
financial year in S(unoa you will pay a per-
sonal tax of 255. p.a. and a salary tax based
on gross salary, including bonuses and allow-
ances, collected at the end of the financial
year. The rates are: £2OO and under,
exempt; £2OO-£4OO, £1: £4OO-£6OO, £2 • £6OO-
- £5; £lOOO-£l5OO, £10; over £l5OO,
What is the approved modern method for
preserving old oil-paintings? —4o7o.
Many methods are current. That recently
applied to paintings by Titian consists pfi
•first thoroughly soaking the canvas in a
solution of paraffin wax. It is then placed
in a frame of metal and asbestos, with
a glass top and holes for ventilation,
appliances for regulating the temperature
and pressure, and an electric fan. The pic-
ture is placed face upwards in the frame
and a solvent vapor applied. Its action is to
dissolve the varnish without disturbing the
delicate original glazes underneath.
• Where is Flint Island and who owns it?
What are its staple industries? Any Euro-
peans there and how reached? —4083.
It is a British possession, one of several
small, isolated islands lying northwards of
Tahiti, and without indigenous inhabitants.
It was originally leased by J. T. Arundel
and Co., but is now held by S. R. Maxwell
and Co., of Tahiti, whose plantations there
contain about 30,000 cocoanut palms. A
white manager and some 30 natives work
the plantations and are visited about four
times annually by a schooner from Tahiti.
I have photographs of the clipper ships
(a) Mount Stewart, (b) Thyatira, (c)
Samuel Plimsoll and (d) Pericles. What
became of these ships? —4o67.
(a) Caught fire in Sydney Harbor in 1904
and was badly damaged. In 1924 she was
sold to a French firm. (b) Wrecked off
Brazil in 1894. (c) Caught fire in the
Thames in 1599 and was scuttled. Having
been repaired, she ran to M.L. till 1904,
when she was sold and converted into a coal
hulk at Fremantle, (d) ‘Sold to Norway in
1904 for the timber trade to Melbourne.
Renamed Sjuroo, she was broken up in 1923.
What are the characteristics of the bird
called the noisy pitta? —4o69.
It is sometimes also called the dragoon-
bird and inhabits the Queensland and north-
ern N.S.W. east coast. It has a black head,
deep-green back, black tail and wing-quills
and buff-colored breast. There are patches
of brilliant metallic blue on the shoulders,
of bright scarlet under the tail and of white
on the wings. It frequents the densest parts
of the scrubs, feeding on insects, snails and
fruits, and would ‘rarely be seen if it did
not draw attention to itself by a loud call
(resembling the words ’"walk to work”),
which it constantly repeats.
I wm making a fishing-rod from saffron
heart. I am told that the timber needs oil-
ing and case-hardening beforehand. Is this
correct, and, if so, how is it done? —4o7s.
The wood is greasy and requires a long
time to season. If made into a rod un-
seasoned it is weak and will not return to
shape after bending. There is no necessity
for oiling, a hard varnish finish being best,
but the wood can be improved by twirling
the stick over a flame—really a method of
quick drying—as practised by North Queens-
land abos. The timber shrinks slightly in
this process, and this should be allowed for.
or the ferrules won’t fit tightly.
My five-year-old fox-terrier dog suffers
from enlarged glands below the jaws und
just above the point on both shoulders.
Cause and treatment?. —3990.
May be due to anaemia or to undiscover-
able causes. Administer half a teaspoon
of syrup of iodide of iron in a little water
twice a day. Feed only once- a day, and let
the meal be mostly raw meat. See the dog
gets a fair amount of exercise to counter-
act the constipating effect of the medicine.
Continue this treatment for a fortnight.
Best diet and clothing when training for
an athletic contest? —4100.
Good, plain food, such as bread and
butter, cheese, eggs, milk, porridge, dripping,
rice pudding, fresh vegetables and fruit.
Eat what you are used to, but be moderate.
Don’t train until two hours after meals.
During your training wear as little clothing
as possible, so that the limbs can move
freely, but don’t risk catching a cold. If
the weather is cold wear a sweater.
Some particulars concerning the bush-
ranger named Jockey Jockey?— 4o96.
His real name was William Westwood.
He was transported to Australia in 1837
when only 16 years old, took to the bush in
the Goulburn district in 1840, and for some
time robbed mail coaches on the Bungendore
road. Growing more daring, he frequented
the main southern road, and even visited
Sydney, but in 1841 was captured, sentenced
to penal servitude for life, and after an
attempt to escape from Cockatoo Island
sent to Port Arthur. He escaped, but was
caught in Hobart and sent to Norfolk Island.
There in July, 1846, he headed a riot, killed
four policemen, and was hanged on October
18.
What is meerschaum, where is it found,
and how is it prepared for use?— -4090.
It is a white or yellowish mineral com-
posed of hydrous silicate of magnesia. When
dry it floats on water. It occurs in beds
and in irregular masses in alluvial deposits
at Ramos and Negropont, in Asia Minor,
in Morocco and ill Spain, where it is used as
a building stone. It is first soaked in
tallow and in wax and then polished.
Recipe for a preservative and dressing for
a leather pigskin suitcase which is show-
ing signs of wear? How should it be applied ?
—3947.
Nothing better than soft soap. Apply spar-
ingly with a flannel, rub well in, and apply
fresh lots until the leather will absorb no
more. Then polish well with a clean flannel,
and rub up with silk.
What are the duties of the Lord Warden
of the Cinque Ports? —4025.
The office is no longer invested with more
than a slight power of jurisdiction. At one
time the Warden was a Judge of Appeal
from the local Courts, but. could be appealed
from to the King’s Bench, though we read
that "flu- King’s ordinary Writ did not run
in the ports.”.
(1) How is a metal decoration in niello
work done? (2) When was it invented and
h y whom f —3998.
(1) _ The design is engraved on an
article in gold or silver, and these engraved
lines are tilled with a composition of
silver, copper, lead and sulphur, which is
made up separately and powdered very
finely. This powder is applied to the metal
with borax, which acts as a flux. The
article is then heated so that the compound
liquefies and runs into the hollows of the
design. When the article is cool the work
is scraped over, polished or burnished, leav-
ing the design outlined in the composition,
which is black upon the metal. (2) Thomas
Finiguerra, a Florentine of about the middle
of the fifteenth century.
Are Australian authors subject to the
payment of American income tax on sums
sent to them from American publishers or
film c05.? —4032.
Yes; but it has been decided by U.S.
1 reasury officials that tax is not applicable
to outright sales, such as serial rights, and
usually film rights, but only to receipts from
royalties, unless outright sales are paid by
instalments. Royalties are taxed 6 per cent,
if the money is sent to the author or his
agent.
I am told that when a word of more than
one syllable is in use both as a noun and
ajs an adjective , it is in certain cases the
practice to differentiate the sound by accent-
ing the last syllable in the adjective but not
in the noun. Can you furnish examples?
—4048.
Com pact (adj.), co /iipact (noun) :
instinct (adj.), instinct (noun) ; content
(adj.), content (noun).
Titles of novels which furnish a picture
of social conditions in the West Indies ?—
4035.
“Far Enough,” by Helen Ashton; “A
High Wind in Jamaica,” by Richard
Hughes; “Susan Proudleigh,” by H. G. De
Lisser; “Black, White and Brindle,” by
Eden Phillpotts; “Hurricane,” bv Lester
Ralph; “The Water Diviner,” by Dolf
Wyllarde.
(1) What is the present-day judgment re-
garding the musical compositions of Anton
Rubinstein? (2) What was his best work?
—4087.
(1) Despite what Grove’s Dictionary
refers to as “a fine broad vein of melody,”
he was not a great composer, and with the
exception of his “Melody in F,” “Trot de
Cavalerie,” “Valse Caprice” and “Kamennoi-
Ostrow” his pianoforte works are seldom
played. (2) His “Ocean Symphony”
(orchestral) probably ranks highest.
(1) Who was St. Augustine? (2) Where
can details of his life be obtained? —4o73.
(1) There were two; Aurelius Augustinus,
the greatest of the four Fathers of the Latin
church, and Augustine or Austin, a Roman
monk, afterwards first Archbishop of Can-
terbury. Aurelius was born in Numidia in
A.n. 354, and was 82 before he became a
Christian. His best-known work is his Con-
fessions, written shortly after he became a
bishop. The other landed in Britain about 596,
established Christianity and died probably in
a.d. 607. (2) Tillemont lias devoted a quarto
volume to Augustinus in his Ecclesiastical
History. The “Encyclopaedia Britannica”
gives a fairly comprehensive account of his
life. For St. Austin the best source is the
Lives of the English Saints, No. 111, 1847.
What price do artists receive for etchings?
—3956.
Prices artists receive for etchings vary
according to the popularity of the author.
Three guineas a copy for an etching in an
edition of, say, 40 would be a remarkably
good price. The average mediocre work,
of which there is plenty, scarcely sells at
all, except perhaps on subject matter. Of
course, work by a man with the reputation
of Norman Lindsay may fetch up to 15
guineas a copy.
What is the International Polar Year ?—
4072.
Fifty years ago an investigation of the
physical condition of the atmosphere in
the neighorhood of the North Pole was
commenced. . From August, 1882, until
August,. 1883, 12 stations in the zone of
latitude from 65deg. to 80deg., and two in
the Antarctic zone, were occupied by repre-
sentatives of different countries, who made
observations according to a concerted plan.
This scheme is now being repeated, and a
party of English meteorologists took up their
station at Fort Rae, Great Slave Lake, in
August, 1932. They will remain until August
or September of this year, making observa-
tions, in concert with representatives of other
countries at other places, of earth-magnet-
ism and atmospheric conditions, the aurora
and determination of its height being a
special object of study.
What is the nature of the new aluminium
alloy which has made an appearance on the
English market? —4068.
It is called M.V.C., and is pure aluminium-
silicon in which impurities have been re-
duced to a negligible proportion. It can be
rolled into thin sheets or drawn into bars,
spun-pressed, or stamped, while castings can
be bent without breaking; it can also be
forged and welded without difficulty. It is
used principally in the form of castings for
parts requiring maximum resistance to
tarnish and corrosion. The alloy has been
employed for naval purposes.
(1) What was the nature of the protest
against the Rational Anthem which caused
a stir in England some time ago? (2)
Was the House of Commons asked to change
the words of the anthem, and, if so, what
was the result of such representations? —
4055.
(1) An anonymous letter appeared in
the “Times” in February, 1931, condemning
the lines “Confound their politics, Frus-
trate their 'knavish tricks,” as “unchristian,
indecent, disgraceful anywhere, in a church
blasphemous, and in a cathedral a brawling
obscenity.” (2) In reply to a Parliamentary
question as to whether the Government
would consider the substitution of a new
and more appropriate verse when the
National Anthem was sung on occasions
for which the Government was responsible,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer replied that
tradition was everything in the matter, and
that, the Government did hot propose to
make any alteration.

terested in Chris; but it is young
Peter Fordyce, a wealthy pearler, and
not Chris, who is interested in June,
June makes a friend of Queenie, a
girl of her own age, about whom
there is some mystery. A letter
from Lettice brightens Chris, but
he fails to notice her references
to a new male friend. Chris, whose
affairs have not been going very
well, loses his diver through paralysis
—a heavy blow. Peter Fordyce pro-
poses to June, but she staves him off ;
and Peter turns enthusiastically to a
new scheme for pooling pearl-shell—
a scheme which will, incidentally,
damage “Monty,” an old friend of
June's family. Goer alone amongst
the master-pearlers stands out of the
scheme, and June is upset by the ill-
feeling that follows. “Monty” tries
to cheer her up. At an “afternoon”
to which June is invited, she is warned
against making a friend of Queenie,
June is furimis, but, walking home,
she sees Kent's lugger coming in and
forgets her troubles.
CHAPTER XIII.
The Festival of the Lanterns.
IN far-away Japan a myriad lanterns were
swinging in street and garden—little,
friendly lights to guide the beloved ghosts
back to earth, where they would find await-
ing them offerings of fruit and saki, fragile
cakes and flowers, pale lotus lilies peopling
the air with elusive wraiths of scent. And
these lanterns, lit in honor of the dead,
would light the dances of the living—sacred
dances, mystic ceremonials, the supreme
rites of the O-Bon Festival, the Feast of
the Lanterns.
In Broome the creek sprouted with a
forest of masts: more than half the pearling
fleet were in. For three days cars laden
with Japanese and Chinese scurried along
the sandy dry track to the cemetery, a drab
little paddock set amid the low scrub and
red-beaned bauhinia trees of the pindan
behind the town. The stores did enormous
trade in joss-sticks and lanterns; the eating-
houses baked spirit cakes; agile brown
fingers twisted wire and tinted paper into
delicate blossoms —there were no lily-ponds
and fragrant gardens in Broome! Neither
would there be dances; only once or twice
had men been found willing to dance the
Bon-Odori, rare occasions when the sea had
taken unusually heavy toll, when amongst
the grey slab headstones of the Asiatic
cemetery were many but newly fetched from
the beach. Nor would port wine or saki be
offered to the spirit-guests: the police of the
white men forbade it—the binghis would
come stealing into the cemetery in search
of tucker, w T hen the feast was over, and the
laws of Australia prohibited the giving of
wine to aborigines. The little yellow men
who went to such infinite pains over their
gifts for the dead held no rancor for this
gobbling of their funeral meats. They were
absolute materialists, for all their spirit
worship: if the natives did not eat the
food, the ants would.
The Malays spent the three days’ holiday
in gambling or playing billiards; they were
not at all concerned about ghosts or pre-
pared to spend money on their ancestors.
Nor were the whites in the least interested
—the majority had no idea what the rites
were about, neither cared nor realised that,
they were witnessing the remnants of a reli-
gion older than Buddhism, the remains of
the ancient Shinto-faith of centuries long
since buried in oblivion: a dismal religion
professing no Nirvana, only a hereafter
wherein disembodied spirits inhabited a
world of darkness, yet possessed the power
to bring either joy or sorrow to those they
had left behind on earth. And so obviously
the spirits had to be propitiated. On the
three days of the year in which they could
return to earth, it behoved their descendants
and friends to greet them with proper atten-
tions and dutiful affection. Only on the
third and last night of the Festival did the
white folk of Broome take notice: then it
had become the fashion to stroll—or motor,
if you possessed a car—out to the cemetery;
of no use hoping to get a taxi, for they were
all far too busy reaping rich harvest from
the Japanese. Once there you could admire
the illuminations, whilst the women and
children gathered lanterns from the graves.
A week had passed since June beheld
Christopher Kent’s lugger sailing up the
creek. A whole long week, and June had
not yet seen him. But she had been told of
his bad luck; and she realised that a dead
diver meant a great deal of business to be
seen to. She went out to the cemetery
with a party of people all piled up in the
Captain’s car, and she knew that if she
missed Chris there she would be obliged to
think of an excuse to make her father look
him up.
The last flush of sunset had died in the
west; the bush loomed eerily against the
sky. A taxi filled with white-clad divers
carrying lighted lanterns passed Goer, cover-
ing them all with dust and making the
Captain curse. Round a sharp curve they
came upon the cemetery, and swiftly the
night was illumined by glow of lanterns
winking in the breeze. Pale-blue lanterns,
merrily dancing, shedding an exotic radiance
on the graves, on the little knots of mor-
tals gathered there in the empty bush, by
shows and symbols fortifying themselves
against the cold impersonal void of star-
sprinkled space, stretching overhead from
flat horizon to flat horizon in one immense
and overpowering arc.
Captain Goer did not care about these
expeditions to the cemetery; there was
nothing more certain to put him in a bad
humor than having to attend a funeral. He
was so rapaciously alive that thought of
death in relation to himself appeared an
impertinence. But the others had wished
to come, so he made a good fellow of him-
self and prowled round exchanging a word
here and there, until he found a man he
wanted to see, and was soon engrossed in
a very material and slightly questionable
transaction which would ultimately bring
to his pockets money that might more justly
have gone elsewhere.
June strolled down the little paths with
the rest, looking at the decorations, praising
here a flower, there a monster lantern. The
night was kind; will-o’-the-wisp light of
lanterns made beautiful the poor little plot,
and invested with dignity and glamor the
pile of a monument in memory of hundreds
of Japs who had perished in one of the big
blows. Scarcely a grave had been forgotten;
and there were many. A lantern, a cake,
a flower would greet nearly every spirit
who answered the call of the fire burning
at the gates. Some, more recently departed,
would learn the affection of their friends
from lavish decoration of their tombs. Only
over the fence, in the white man’s plot,
brooded darkness and desolation: no fire
burned a bright welcome at that gate to
call back the dead, to bid them remember
they were not forgotten.
June glanced into the blackness; whimsi-
cally she wished she could light a dancing
lantern for the tiny newly-turned grave she
knew lay there in the shadows—children
adored Japanese lanterns. All the children
of Broome seemed to be at the cemetery,
laughing, running, down the paths, pointing
and calling to each other in high excite-
ment: “Bags I that one!” as they singled
out the spoils which would be theirs when
the moon rose and the festival was over.
Hashimoto’s grave burned like an oasis
of light. Triple strings t>f nodding lanterns
swung above the disturbed earth, and at
each corner winked enormous square lan-
terns, beautiful things, handmade, carved,
painted, trailing streamers of white paper
cut out in cryptic designs; lotus lilies, pale
and exquisite as the paper lanterns, lay
beside mounds of food and fruit. A crowd
of divers stood round, talking and laughing
their indifference to the fate of all flesh.
To-morrow, next year they also might be
creeping in from the cold dark world of
the Hereafter; but their Oriental fatalism
allowed no shadow to fall upon the present.
When the spirits had been appeased and
fittingly entertained, the living would troop
back to Chinatown to entertain themselves.
The Festival of the Lanterns was no occa-
sion for lamentation.
June admired the big square lanterns on
Hashimoto’s grave immensely.
“I make’m that one,” announced a Jap in
whom she recognised one of the store-
keepers. “Him verry fine feller. You like’m,
you have. By’m-by I give you.”
June thanked him; the yearly bestowal of
special lanterns she knew to be a mark of
high esteem. As for the ordinary blue ones
—anyone who could get them first was
welcome to them, once the moon rose. June
already had a pile of those at home, the
ones she used for dances.
“What - for you
do all this, Yuki?”
chipped in a young
shell-opener stand-
ing near by. “That
one take you long
time to make—you
suppose spirit
jump-up. take a
look-see ' lanterns
and eat-up cakes
and fruit?”
Yuki turned an
inscrutable face in
the direction of the
speaker, and for a
while stared in
silence at the white fool. “You bury white
feller, you suppose spirit jump-up smell’m
flowers?” he retorted at length with calm
disdain.
He turned back to June. “What happened
to Hashimoto?” she asked. And Yuki began
a long story about the demons in the
diamond-fish.
Kent, who had just come out and was
walking across to his diver’s grave, sud-
denly found his attention rivetted by sight
of the girl’s absorbed face, now clearly seen,
now elusive, in the fitful light of dancing
lanterns. Divers and finance fled from his
mind; he became conscious of an enormous
longing—if only for one moment he might
be transplanted from this alien bush to
England!
June moved and saw him. Welcome leapt
to her face/into her eager eyes; and Kent,
quickening his step to meet her, found him-
self grasping her outstretched hand and
thinking he had really forgotten what a
charming child she was.
Desire sharpened June’s wits. She was
never quite certain how she contrived it,
but somehow she at last found herself down
on the foreshore alone with Chris. He had
told her about the spirit boats which would
be sent sailing down the creek when the
affair at the cemetery was over; and June,
finding that her father refused to be bored
any longer, had told him she was going with
Mr. Kent. Somehow she had managed to
leave her father to look after the rest of the
party, without waiting to hear what he had
to say. It had been more difficult to elude
Peter, who had come up and wished to
take them back to his house; but it had
accomplished, and there at last she
was, standing on the grey beach beside
Chris, who would have been hugely ‘sur-
prised had he guessed it was any more than
chance which had left him alone with June.
The familiar sprawling sheds and the
stores behind looked weird in the light of
a waning moon which rose over the man-
grove swamps and threw a red fantastic
light on Chinatown. There was scarcely a
soul about. The whites had gone home with
their spoils; the night had grown chilly. A
few devoted Japs waited to set sail the
spirit ships; the others knew the necessary
ceremonial would be completed and had
already departed to chop-suey shops, to
lodgings, to the mysterious house hidden in
a clump of bamboos at the top of Sheba
Lane.
Down at the water’s edge stood June and
Chris, and the moon cast a long red path
to their feet, and the strangeness of it made
June shiver. The cries of the men with the
ships came fitfully to their ears, were carried
away by a rising wind.
The little boats were to carry the spirits
back to their own dark world; although
Chris, who did not know the ritual or that
on every lake and stream in far-away Japan
fleets of fairy-boats were also setting sail,
told June these contained offerings for the
ghosts of men lost at sea. Yuki would have
told her they were but a final courtesy to
departing guests: spirits were very small,
they did not need much space, and the four
or five little boats, fashioned of iron,
painted, decorated with lanterns, laden with
food, were large enough to carry away all
the ghosts of Broome.
Out went the fragile craft, caught by the
ebb-tide. The wind ballooned their tiny
sails; down the creek they drifted, out to
the open bay, with gay lanterns bobbing to
the waves; and with them went the sOuls
of the men who had so often sailed out the
self-same way in search of pearls.
June drew her breath sharply. They were
lovely, the little craft, till the night swal-
lowed them, till their brave gay lights were
obliterated by mangrove swamps.
“It’s all over,” she murmured regretfully.
“I suppose we should go home.”
CHAPTER XIV.
The Cattle-run.
Kent had gone ashore in the dinghy
almost before the anchor-chain rattled out
in Dampier Creek. He felt thankful to
get away from the lugger, from the sail-
wrapped form lying in the bunk, from the
smell of death. He interviewed the neces-
sary authorities, the doctor, the police and
the president of the Japanese club, and
made arrangements for the removal of
Hashimoto’s body to the morgue behind the
hospital. Then he walked slowly along to
the Buccaneer Arms.
He knew he should really go and see
young Fordyce at once, to discover the
exact extent of the loss incurred by Hashi-
moto’s death; but the prospect appeared
so depressing that he felt he would rather
let the matter slide until the following day.
He trudged along dejectedly. As soon as
he reached the pub, where one of his boys
had been bidden to leave a suit-case, he
would get out of the grubby khaki suit he
was still wearing, and have a general clean-
up and feel the better for it. -
But when he stepped into the shade of
the hotel verandah and heard laughter from
the bar, a drink suddenly appeared of far
greater importance. For the first time in
his life Christopher Kent yielded to an
immediate . inclination without any regard
for appearances; and if he forgot he was
unshaA r en and untidy, certainly the men
leaning over the bar counter failed to
remark anything unusual in his appearance.
They were used to such things, and did not
remember that hitherto the Hon. Christo-
pher had at all times appeared immaculate.
The long whisky in its glass frosted with
cold tasted wonderful; it flowed soothingly
along Kent’s veins, straightened his shoul-
ders, brightened his eyes. He looked round
at once to see if he knew any of the men;
but, although one face seemed familiar, he
could not remember the fellow’s name.
It was a point of honor with Chris never
to drink alone, so he turned to the man
closest, a stocky red-faced person with a
bald head, and asked him to have a spot.
“Too right I will,” replied the stranger.
“Meet my mate, Mr.”
“Kent,” answered Chris.
“Oh, I’ve heard about you.” A pair of
keen eyes narrowed; Chris was subjected to
swift and detailed scrutiny. “Name of Ryce
meself. Th’ other feller answers best to
Steve, though he’s known to the police as
Munro. Pleased ter meet yer.”
Kent shook hands with both men. A long,
cadaverous, hungry-looking chap, he thought
Munro, but he paid little attention to either
at first. They were a means to an end.
But after a round or two, Chris grew more
interested in his companions and even
started talking to the barmaid. A new girl;
he thought there was something rather jolly
and kind about her and discovered her name
to be Ivy. She had black hair, and brown
eyes which kindled when she laughed, yet
looked sad as a spaniel’s when she was not
throwing her head back and showing her
teeth. Chris liked the quiet way she went
about her work, ready enough to joke, but
not thrusting herself at a man like so many
of the girls.
“How’s pearling?” he heard Ryce ask.
“Not up to much,” he answered and
laughed a dry laugh. “I’ve just come from
the morgue—lost a diver three days ago!”
“You don’t say! Well, I always did
reckon it’s a mug’s game. I got out meself
and into something better.” Kent, ordering
more drinks, missed the wink, the knowing
look as much as to say, “Here we are!”
which Ryce threw to his mate. “Me and
him ain’t, been into town now fer a coupla
years. We’re in to ship cattle now, but the
blanky boats charge so much I reckon we’ll
have ter overland the cows to Perth, after
all. A thousand miles to a rail-head is a
swine of a trek. But we’ve got a choice little
mob, three hundred-odd at twenty jims a
head. Not too bad, eh?”
“Very good,” replied Chris politely and
indifferently. “Where is your station? I
thought most of the country back of here
was poor stuff and that there was only one
big run close to Broome?”
“No fear! We’ve got a slice of first-class
country to the north. We done very well
since we took it up—a darn sight better
than fishing for pearls you don’t get! Only
me and Steve here and a tribe of niggers to
do the work. Classy stock-boys they make
too. The only trouble is that we could do
with a bit more hard cash. The bulls are
old, we want some new blood—that’s one of
the reasons we’re so keen to get this mob
off quick to catch the good market. A week
in a boat—six months’ overland. A darned
shame I call it, the way the shipping com-
panies bleed us poor blokes.”
“What we really need is another partner,”
murmured Steve in a faint, tired voice.
“Sleeper. Put his money in and draw div-
vies. Damned good divvies in a year or
two, I may say. But in this blarsted town
everyone is so taken up with a luxury trade
that they don’t know a good proposition
when they see one—anyone’d think they’d
never heard of cattle or sheep or anything
else but pearls!”
Munro’s voice arrested Kent’s attention;
he had been digesting one phrase of Ryce’s
which stuck in his mind: “Fishing for pearls
you don’t get.” Now he glanced at Steve.
Educated fellow, evidently. What was he
saving?
“I don’t suppose you’ve got any spare
cash, Mister? We’d sell you a third share
and welcome, just to get the place going in
good style. You could easily sell out to
us later on at a profit. That is, if you still
preferred pearling; but I seem to remember
it is supposed to be sound business not to
have all your eggs in one basket.”
“Garn, Steve,” cried Ryce laughing up-
roariously. “You have a hide! Fancy trying
to hawk it round like that—as if Mr. Kent’s
going to buy stations from a pair o’ pick-ups
in a pub! What d’yer take him for?—he’ll
reckon you’re some sort of smart Alec.”
“You speak for yourself. You’re always
full of suspicions. You don’t imagine, Kent,
that I’d suggest anything that wasn’t quite
above-board?” Steve leant confidentially
towards Chris.
“My dear chap, of course not!” Chris
felt warmed towards the stranger whose
whisky he was drinking. “I only hope you’ll
get somebody. Sounds excellent to me, but
I came up here to get pearls—which, as Mr.
Ryce says, don’t show up. I leave cattle
to sensible fellows like yourselves. Have
another spot? Ivy!”
Mr. Montgomery had heard that Chris
had come in, and also the reason thereof,
long before lunchtime; yet he, who thought
himself beyond surprise, experienced a faint
sense of shock when Chris walked in to the

table in a grubby suit, still unshaven, dark
cheeks heightening the brilliance of his eyes.
“You must forgive me, Monty,” he said
jovially, “but I’ve had a hell of a lot to
do, and no time to change.”
“I heard you’ve had some bad luck.”
“The devil’s own! Poor old Hashimoto!”
His tongue tripped over the name.
So that was why Chris’s eyes were so
bright, why he had not found time to
change! Well, it was a pity. But you
couldn’t blame him. There were times
when it seemed the only consolation left!
Kent’s interview with Peter Fordycc
proved even more disastrous than he
expected.
A smart, brisk Chris set out for China-
town in the morning, in crisp white suit and
newly pipeclayed topee and shoes. The
morning air struck fresh on his face as he
sped along in one of the rickety old tourers,
hoodless and shabby, which plied between
the jetty and Chinatown, picking up pas-
sengers a;t a shilling a head for the two-mile
run. The iridescent bay gleamed a faint
promise; luggers’ sails shone pure as pearls.
The Japanese taxi-driver was blandly polite
and the two shell-openers who boarded the
car were in high spirits: one had brought
in a seventy-grain stringer and expected to
get at least three hundred pounds commis-
sion. He knew he was not supposed to talk
about it, and so far he had managed to
hold his tongue; but exhilaration bubbled
out of him, and for that morning he beheld
Broome through rose-tinted spectacles.
Kent’s volatile spirits rose. He swung into
Peter’s office with a smile on his lips.
After he left, Peter sat for some time and
played with a pencil, drawing circles and
squares on the blotter on his large deal
table. Nothing had been altered in the big
room, with its shuttered windows, since the
days of his father. A safe, chairs, a few
charts on the walls, a set of pigeon-holes
and the plain kitchen table which did duty
as desk.
Kent ha.d looked so hopeful when he came
in—Peter had not cared for the half-hour
which followed. This loss of a diver was
calamitous! The thousand pounds which
Chris had brought to the partnership with
old Captain Kent had been swallowed; they
were already two hundred in debt.
“Where has it gone?” demanded Chris
almost, thought young Fordyce, like a
forlorn child.
Peter explained as best he could, bade
Chris remember he had warned him not to
be extravagant, but had to admit that the
old Captain had been responsible for a great
deal—only a fool would have advanced
Hashimoto nearly three hundred pounds—
all lost now. And, then, they had had such
rotten luck.
“Rotten luck,” murmured Chris. “I should
say so! Never a pearl worth mentioning.
I don’t think much of this business—l
thought the old fellow was straight enough,
but he never said a word about the back
stuff you’ve just shown me.”
“Well, cheer up,” commented Peter. “You
should have insisted, you know. But never
mind, we’ll rake round for another diver.
There’s probably one or two who didn’t
sign up, though it is so late in the year.
Worse debts have been paid off than this—
it’s nothing. One decent pearl would square
it and leave a handsome balance.”
“That’s all very well. What if the said
pearl never appears?”
“Well, the bank will advance,on your
shell-take,” replied Peter trying to make a
joke of it. “And if' the worst comes to the
worst, you’ll be working for Fordyce and
Sons next year.”
“Thanks awfully, old fellow, but I’d rather
not,” Kent said studying his nails. Abruptly
Peter thought it strange that he should
always have felt Chris to be no older than
himself. The deep lines running from nos-
trils to mouth made him look middle-aged
now—and it was extraordinary how he had
hitherto failed to notice the almost bitter
droop of his lips!
Chris rose suddenly with an unexpected
bluntness, and for once the lift of his hazel
eyes did not create a.ny illusion of youth
to give the lie to Peter’s observations.
“I’ll drop in to see you later,” he said
and went out quickly.
He walked swiftly enough down the road;
but the spring had vanished from his step.
He was merely in a hurry; he had remem-
bered the two men he had met the day
before.
He had scarcely listened to their talk
then, but it recurred to him now. He was
tired of this pearling game. Two years—
and he was considerably worse off than
when he arrived. He could still raise
another thousand; it might be worth look-
ing into the cattle business.
Ryce and Munro spent part of the morn-
ing wondering if it were worth while follow-
ing up the bar acquaintance of the day
before. Munro decided that a direct attack
would be rather too obvious; they would do
a pub-crawl, and be sure to’ run across the
Hon. Chris sometime in the day. Ryce set
out at once, jambing an old wideawake
over his shiny head. Steve Munro said he
preferred to wait for the new suit he had
ordered yesterday from Wing Loon.
“Think yerself a toff again, eh? Reckon
the station’ll pay fer it?” demanded his
mate.
“Of course. Who else? As a matter of
fact, I believe in making a good impression.”
“I’m a bushman!” Ryce snorted.
“You look the part to a T, my dear chap.
Just as I did—yesterday. To-day the Hon!
Chris will discover one of his own kind.”
Ryce’s red face split into a grin. He gave
a shout of laughter. “We ain’t got Buck-
ley’s chance of a deal, if that’s the case,”
he commented, and went out still shaking
with ribald mirth.
Yet Munro was right: when eventually,
after several inquiries, Kent ran him to
earth in a tiny room at the Sun Hotel,
he felt both surprised and pleased to be
greeted by a white-clad, quiet-spoken man,
thin to a degree, but lacking the hungry
look he had so disliked the previous da.y.
Chris felt doubly relieved because he did
not much care for the Sun Hotel: it stood
at the head of Sheba Lane, down in China-
town, cheek by jowl with the Japanese
house behind its screen of bamboo. The
publican was a decent enough chap, but a
lot. of drinking went on at the Sun, and
Chris had always imagined it a snide sort
of place and avoided it. As he stood wait-
ting whilst the barman kindly went to see
if Munro was in his room, he noticed with
pleased astonishment how clean it was, how
brightly polished the floors.
The barman returned with the desired
information; Chris followed him down a
long passage, through a rather dismal dining-
room, which must have been impossibly hot
'but for the drab punkahs hanging limp at
that hour in the morning, and out into a
kind of walled-off cubby on the verandah,
where. Munro sat on one of the two stretcher
beds which comprised the furniture.
“Good-morning,” he cried affably jump-
ing up. “This is a pleasure, Mr. Kent.
Wait a moment, Jack. What’ll you have—
gin?”
Steve could afford to be extremely hospit-
able—he had not dreamed of such a stroke
of luck as Kent’s looking him up. And his
whole demeanor left no room for doubt of
the genuine pleasure the visitor inspired.
By nightfall Christopher Kent had become
a squatter, with a third share in Ryce and
Munro’s Pindan Plains Station, north of
Broome, in the province of Wek Kimberley.
Munro had been very loath, he said, to
do anything in a hurry—surely Kent must
want to go more fully into the matter, see
his banker, get outside advice? Of course
there was no denying that it would be all
to the advantage of the place if the money
could be put into it at once; on the other
hand, it was always a pity if one rushed
things, and then perhaps regretted it. Chris j
agreed, thinking of his transactions with his !
pearling partner. But this was rather different.
To begin with, he was very favorably im-
pressed by Munro, now he had talked to
him a little. No ordinary rough cattle-
man like his mate, this fellow; he even
knew some of the same people in the Old
Country. They understood each other.
And Munro quite evidently thought his
mate a most able chap—what Ryce did not
know about stock was obviously not worth
knowing. They would soon have a wonder-
ful property; lack of funds alone had held
them back. Chris remembered some of the
Victorian squatters he had known in aide-
de-camp days—there was no doubt about it
being a paying game! He even suggested
to Munro that sheep were more profitable
than cattle. “I know,” replied Steve,
thoughtfully. “But this is rather far north.
Still, a few have done well even further up,
and Ryce and I have thought of experiment-
ing; it’s just being so broke”
Kent and Munro were still talking when
Ryce, very genial after his pub-crawl,
returned for lunch. Steve told him, in the
lavatory, that the matter was all but fixed.
“Too easy,” was his comment. “He’ll want
advice.”
“He doesn’t. He takes my word.”
“Garn!”
“I tell you he does! I’ll show him the
books after—you’ve got ’em fixed? My
deah chappie, he reckons I’m ‘one of us.’
And so I was—-once. I know his sort. He’s
been brought up to believe in people, and
the poefr boob is still doing it. Me lad, he
is almost too good to be true—in Broome!”
“Don’t get the bit between yer teeth—he
may change his mind. Come on, his nibs
will be waiting ter go ter lunch—me lord,
dinner is served!”
(To be continued next week.)
Sail.
I’ll sing no ballad of far Ushant, no song
of a racing ship,
Nor pen an ode to the driving load that
the Biscay comber scales ;
But rather I’ll tell of the short steep swell,
an’ me in a two-ton slip
Of a Queensland craft with her loading aft,
an’ only the power of sails.
Me topmast’s spliced with a stove-pipe fish,
an’ the garboard’s caulked with pitch,
With ev’ry line from keel to chine as tight
as a barrel-an’-bung;
I’ve shaken a reef in the whistling teeth of a
southerly buster, which
The power fleet were loath to meet, and in
anchored shelter swung.
I’ve laid her off an’ I’ve laid her on at the
mouth of Pancake Creek,
With a six-knot up an’ a five-knot down,
an’ a beam-tide roll that looks
From the deck of my ship like the Queens-
cliff rip, an’ I’m there for half the
week.
From dawn to dark, for mangrove bark,
an’ a crate of half-drowned ebooks !
An’ many a night when I’m beating down—
ah, pity a seaman’s dreams! —
This ketch of mine is a frigate fine, an’
I’m there on the fighting poop,
With our yardarms locked an’ our gun-ports
blocked —hear the bosun’s pipe as it
screams:
“Away! We’ll meet on their quarter-deck !
Bay aft an’ take the sloop!’’

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Bronze Hawk is an unsatisfactory animal.
He races like a champion now and then,
and like a commoner on other occasions. A
short-priced favorite for the Three-year-old
Handicap at Rosehill, he never travelled
like a winner and was just lumbering along,
well beaten, when Prowler (12 to 1), Cer-
cello (7 to 1) and Dame Moab (4 to 1)
were battling out a desperate finish. At the
Leger, Dame Moab seemed to have the others
settled, but weight told on the little filly
and she ended up third to Prowler and Cer-
cello, with heads between. Prowler is a
rather good sort of gelding by Spearhead—
Queen of Night.
Bronze H'awk had had a race, so there
was little wanting on the score of condition.
Veilmond’s appearance in the Flying Handi-
cap was his first this year. Few thought he
could win “first up,” especially as he has-
grown into a massive stallion, and those
who discarded him on that account felt sorry
for themselves when they saw him cut down
Loch Garry (5 to 1) brilliantly to beat him
by a neck. A few minutes later those who
had turned from Veilmoiid to Loch Garry
were delighted, for Veilmond’s jockey,
McCarten, failed to draw the weight. A
leaden vest had been overlooked, and Veil-
mond carried 9st. 51b. instead of 9st. 121 b.
He hadn’t been backed to any extent, but
punters who took the price (tens) had rea-
son For the soreness they expressed. Ranier
was placed second to Loch Garry, who was
ridden by Robinson, and Promptitude third.
MoCarten was suspended for two months.
Rampion’s growing reputation as a sire
was enhanced by the easily-gained success
of his daughter Emily Rose in the Maiden
Bert ‘."Those people have lost

Giert \" Hush ! We just picked

Bert ; * But ( it \bmt ours"
G\ERT ; Vou MEAN, IT wasn't OURS
Two-year-old Handicap, for which she was
one of the favorites. Whitta, a brilliant
sprinter, was the other party to the union
that produced Emily Rose. J. M. Dunning-
ham nas done no fielding since he became a
Cabinet Minister, but a horse or two carry
his colors. His Astute (Magpie—Earloona),
starting at 8 to 1, downed a warm favorite,
Motor, in the Maiden Handicap. She is a
sister to Karuma.
A plunge on Lavington was the feature
of the betting on the Rosehill Handicap, and
Lorigan’s horse finished up at 5 to 2. He
landed the money, but did not seem likely
to do it till the last 40 or 50 yards. Then
Simpson belted him for all he was worth
along the rails, a gap having been left by
Nord (8 to 1), who had come fast in the
middle of the track. Kelso’s horse was tiring
a little, and a few gigantic strides took the
favorite to the front, the winner by a head.
New King (7 to 1) was a poor third, and
Cherbourg, the second favorite, nowhere. It
was a double for Simpson, who had piloted
Astute. He is doing well this season.
A good many punters for whom it had
been a losing day tried to get square on
Maltdale (7 to 4), a stable-companion of
Veilmond and Ranier, in the Carlingford
Handicap. Badly placed most of the way. he
came with a fine run in the straight, but
could not overhaul Bold Boy (5 to 1), on
whom Britt had stolen a nice lead; Lorason
(6 to 1) was third and Cylanta, finishing
well, fourth. Bold Boy can gallop when he
likes, but—as with other offspring of Brazen
—the difficulty is to catch him in the mood.

Ascot (Vic.) broke its attendance record
on Saturday. The V.T. and R.A., which
conducts horse, pony and trotting racing
there, has benefited wonderfully by coming
under V.R.C. jurisdiction. So far few of the
big Melbourne bookmakers have taken out
paddock licenses for Ascot, perhaps because
of the frequency with which short-priced
horses score. Eight of the ten winners on
Saturday started at 9 to 2, 10 to 9, 6 to 4,
7 to 2, 5 to 4, 2 to 1, 6 to 4 on and 5 to 2.
In the Five Hundred, furlongs, Valmist,
Harry Gavin and Largesse competed. Val-
mist registered his fourth consecutive suc-
cess by carrying Bst. 91b and romping home
in advance of Harry Gavin and Grenadier —
a half-brother to the Westralian Derby hero,
Olympian. As Harry Gavin met Valmist
on 161 b. better terms than when the grand-
son of Valais vanquished him in the Five
Hundred on January 14, Fred Hoysted felt
hopeful of his little fellow turning the tables;
but Valmist has improved out of all know-
ledge, and never left the issue in doubt.
The time, lmin 6fsec., is believed to be a
recor'd for the course. Handicapper A. J.
Gray cannot remember anything better than
lmin. 7sec. having been done before.
Valmist is owned and trained by R. Fish-
wick, who used to be stud-groom for E. M.
Pearce at Mount Martha, Mornington. Fish-
wick wisely has made hay while the sun
shines, but if Valmist had been reserved for
the Newmarket Handicap he would have got
much less than Bst. 61b. Largesse (33 to 1)
ran fifth in the Five Hundred. This Tippler
mare originally belonged to Mrs. Hunter
White, but at' present is raced by James
Scobie. Protea, the V.R.C. Oaks winner, was
another starter and met with mild support.
She looked really well to the eye, but is more
of a stayer than a sprinter and failed to
show up.
Even money was accepted about Torado
(Equator—Adamant), a filly that carries
the colors of H. A. Currie, for a two-year-old
race. Torado was hampered by begin-
ning flat-footed and had to concede the
leaders an appalling start from the home
turn. Half-way down the straight Courtney
tried to force a passage, but was compelled
to pull bacls and go the outside. Even under
these disadvantages Torado finished third.
The winner, Beautiful Girl, was saddled up
by “Horie” Leek, whose late father landed
the Caulfield Cup of 1900 with Ingliston. She
is by Beau Fils, sire of Waltzing Lily, from
Traward, by Trafalgar from Ada Ward, by
Harmonist, and cost only 45 guineas as a
yearling.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
“Tom Cribb”: The British heavyweight
championship at London Olympia saw the
title retained by Welshman Jack Petersen,
who knocked out his London opponent, Jack
Pettifer, in the 12th round. Petersen, at
13st., was giving away 3st. 101 b. and a lot
of height and reach as well. He went for
the Englishman from the jump, however, and,
though he stopped some stiff ones, gave him
the father of a hiding.
Lundyn, the fiery Finn, made things lively
for Lurich at Leichhardt. Although Lurich
looked big enough to beat a couple of Lun-
dyns before breakfast, the Finn threw the
Russian about like a bag of bran for two of
the six rounds. But it wasn’t Lundyn’s
night to win, and Lurich’s figure-four body-
scissors scored a fall in the third round.
The equalising fall was delayed till the fifth;
Lundyn grabbed the Russian’s hair, pulled
him back and applied a flying-mare and a
body-press. Lurich’s slam put Lundyn out
of action in the last round.
Ins and Outs
The Board of Control’s reply to the M.C.C.
cable refusing to interfere in the leg-theory
controversy practically skated round the
subject. While no apology was made for the
use of the word “unsportsmanlike” in the
first message to Lord’s, the board says it
appreciates the difficulty the M.C.C. finds in
dealing with the matter without having seen
the actual play. It reiterates its objection
to such bowling as against the spirit of the
game as well as dangerous, and says it
has appointed a committee to devise a means
of eliminating the practice from Australian
cricket, whatever may happen elsewhere.
The committee consists of gentlemen notori-
ously opposed to leg-theory. The board
adds that it will forward a copy of
that committee’s findings for the infor-
mation of the M.C.C.
The Marylebone Club cleared the air with
a further cable in which it records its plea-
sure that the Australian body does not con-
template cancelling the tour, and asks if
it may conclude that the good sportsmanship
of the English team is not in question. With-
out waiting for the board to reply, the man-
agers of the English team asked for a with-
drawal of the word “unsportsmanlike”
through the British Government represen-
tative in Australia, and P. F. Warner said
at Brisbane “I pray for peace as much as
any statesman prayed for peace when his
country was in war.” Pity so many well-
meaning persons have allowed themselves
to be dragged into an exaggerated attitude
over what, in cold truth, is but a trumpery
matter in a world full of infinitely more
threatening problems.
Requiring to beat both N.S.W. and Vic-
toria outright, South Australia began the
last Sheffield Shield match but one of the
season against the Ma State at Sydney
Cricket Ground. The opening stages of the
game were full of interest, the home side
going to pieces before Wall, who, bowling
magnificently on a perfect batsman s
wicket, got _lO wickets for 30> e
SSS 4 I'LrXly
Bradman was the only other double-figure
score in a tally which included six blobs.
The bowling of Tobin, selected for the fourth
Test was quite innocuous, while Grimmett
again failed to get a wicket, though it must
be said, that he nursed the later batsmen for
Wall’s benefit. South Australia did little
better, the innings closing for 114. After
Richardson and Nitschke had gone for 5 and
12 respectively, Lonergan made 22. Then
began a collapse which was only stayed by
a stubborn stand by Shepherd (32) and
vtall (13), the innings ending at 114.
Howell, with 5 for 31, bowled exceedingly
well after dropping to medium pace, and
McCabe got 2 wickets for IS, one of them
being Richardson. O’Reilly and Bradman
each took a wicket. . . .
McCabe followed his debut as an opening
bowler with a turn as opening batsman in
put urfa^p'artnership 1 lieforT
and went to a catch by ’keeper Walker off
Wall. Fingleton was caught by Tobin off
Wall for a duck, and Rowe was dismissed
by Lee for 19. A dashing innings by Brad-
man ended at 97. when Lee clean bowled
him. Cummins (36) and Love (31) took
the total to 356.
Nitschke (105) made a fine attempt to
win the match for South Aus., but after
Richardson (35) left wickets fell rapidly
6 being down for 185. O’Reilly (5 for 45)
did most of the damage. Tobin (1) again
failed.
* * :J: ❖
After a holiday match at Toowoomba, the
English Eleven turned out against Queens-
land on the Brisbane Cricket Ground, Eng-
land’s first appearance on this arena for
many a long day. The visitors fielded their
last Test team, except Voce, who is down
with influenza, Bowes going in in his place.
Queensland’s side included the aboriginal
Gilbert and young Govan, the schoolboy
slow bowler. England was evidently out
for a Test-match practice, but in one or
two instances found the batting unexpectedly
strong, the Bananalanders shaping much
better against the fast stuff than they have
done this season to slow and medium bowl-
ing in the Sheffield Shield games. However,
the general run of the batting bordered on
the abject, and the first innings of the locals
ended for 201 (Litster 67, C'Qok 53 and
Andrews 45). England was 6 for 169 at
lupch on Monday; Oxenham then had 3
for 38.

“Gabba” : Everyone will hear with regret
that Archie Jackson has suffered a recurrence
of the illness which has kept him out of first-
class cricket for some time. The attack was
serious, and he is now in a Brisbane hos-
pital. To many understanding the con-
ditions it seems peculiar that Jackson
should have been advised to take up hi.s
quarters in Brisbane instead of some inland
place.

Ins and Outs
"Mells”: “No Englishman has written
about cricket so fascinatingly as Barrie and
Andrew Lang, who were born and bred north
of the Tweed” (R.P. 25/l/’33). And liow
hard some of their pleasant conceits die!
At one of the receptions to the English
cricketers the other day. chairman Henry
Braddon revived the story attributed to
Barrie of how he went to Lord’s on purpose
to see a famous cHcketer of pre-war days and
had the bad luck to find the hero right out of
form. “Iu the first innings he made 1; in
the second he was not quite so fortunate.”
On this occasion the story was told at
Warner’s expense; the beauty of that sort
of anecdote is that it can be hung on anyone
who happens to be handy.
* * * $
“Rabbit”: One of the features of the Aus-
tralian batting in the Tests this season has
been the failure of the opening batsmen.
Indeed, save in the first match, England has
also been notable in this respect. Why not
try sending in a couple of tail-end batsmen
to change the luck? In the fifth Test
against Chapman’s side in 1929, Hornibrook
and Oldfield were sent in to open Australia’s
second innings. Both were unbeaten at
stumps and carried the score to 51 for the
first wicket next day, laying the foundations
of Australia’s solitary victory in that series.
* Jjc * *
‘‘Five Ways”: Queensland’s Sheffield
Shield side suffered its sixth outright defeat
of the season at Brisbane when South Aus-
tralia beat the Bananalanders by 9 wickets.
With a first-innings knock of 129, the
home side replied to South Australia’s first
innings of 249 with 192, Levy (68) top-
scpnng. Grimmett this time took 7 for 86.
Walker again seconding him ably behind the
stumps. South Australia lost Nitschke for
9 to get the runs required, Lonergan (28)
and Richardson (39) being both n.o. Queens-
land cricket has fairly gone to the pack during
the past two seasons.
* * * *
“Methuselah”: The many ancients who
have been talking and writing about body-
fine bowling as if it were an entirely new
idea must have overlooked a London
’Punch” cartoon, first published in 1854
and reproduced in the famous journal last
week. The drawing shows the batsmen and
all the field arrayed in a heavily-padded cos-
tume from head to foot, with divers’ hel-
mets. The caption is “New Cricketing
Dresses to Protect All England Against Pre-
sent Swift Bowling.”
* * * *
“Shrewsbury”: When the Marylebone
club gave the Australian Board of Control
the option of putting up with leg-theory bowl-
ing or cancelling the Tests it was taking a
chance. Cancellation would have meant
that there would have been no Australian
visit to England for some years at least;
then some of the smaller first-class coun-
ties, which rely on the periodical Austra-
lian tours to replenish their coffers, would
have had to put up the shutters. Not only
do they make a handsome profit from the
matches on their own grounds, but they g("
a substantial cut of the Test takings.
Commenting on this, PI. J. Henley, of
London “Daily Mail,” estimates that the
counties would lose at least £2OOO apiece
tr°rn the Test funds, and larger sums from
the Australian fixtures against themselves.
* * * *
“Jolimount”: Hendry, who some years ago
left his native Sydney for Melbourne, where
he has recently been captain and coach of
j-“ e colts* team, is returning to take up a
billet in Sydney. Hendry was a member of
the Australian teams of 1921 and 1926.
His batting average in Tests was 21.84 fol-
io innings, with a top score of 112. In
bowling he took 14 wickets for 36.2§ runs
apiece. In Sheffield cricket he averaged
40.44 for 82. innings with the bat. his high-
est score being 177. In bowling his figures
were 101 wickets for 29.48 each.
“Spare Mussolini”: One obscure Austra-
lian _ cricketer has taken his own way of
settling the leg-theory bowling problem, while
all the experts have -been satisfied to write
and talk about it. He was batting in a
junior match in Sydney when the opposing
bowler resorted to Larwoodian tactics. The
embryo Digger took a couple of thumps in
the slats, and then, walking down the pitch
laid the aggressor on his back with a hefty
punch. Umpires and fieldsmen restored
order, and the game was resumed—without
leg-theory bowling.
Racquet and Bawl
Australia more than held its own in the
national championships concluded in Mel-
bourne last week. Crawford won the singles
title for the third time, boating Gledhill 3
sets to 1. With Mrs. Crawford he beat Vines
and Mrs. Van Ryn in the mixed doubles,
but went down, in partnership with Moon, to
Vines and Gledhill in the men’s doubles. Of
the other events, Quist, of S. Aus., won the
junior singles from Purcell (Vic.), while
Joan Hartigan overcame Mrs. Buttsworth,
bolder of the title, in the women’s singles.
It was hard luck on the loser, who would
have collected the championship cup for keeps
had .she won on this occasion. The Queensland
pair, Mesdames Molesworth and Wesfma-
cott, took the women’s doubles from Mrs
Van Ryn and Joan Hartisran.

m the Aorangi. They have been popular,
and it is not easy to estimate at this short
range the extent of the influence they have
had on the game in this country, though
there was evidence before the end of the
tour that their example had visibly improved
the standard. The tourists seem to have
enjoyed their trip, Vines especially. If he
can manage it, he intends to come back in
a couple of years, bringing with him
America’s Viv McGrath, young Frank
Parker. He can count on the heartiest of
welcomes.

“Bournemouth”: Entries for this year’s
Davis Gup closed last week. The tally for
the European zone is 24, compared with 28
last _ year; it includes Australia, Britain,
Belgium, Germany, Poland, Italy, South
Africa, Holland, Japan, Spain and Ireland.
There are nine entries from the two
Americas, and such countries as Denmark,
Czecho-Slovakia, India and most certainly
France will also be included in the European
roster. Australia has drawn a bye in the
first round and will then play Norway.
Germany, Britain and Japan may prove
tough nuts to crack. The Italians, as they
are to-day, should prove less formidable than
of yore when they upset Australia’s apple-
cart at Genoa.

N.S.W. Country Week in Sydney produced
a feast of good tennis and introduced some
promising young players. The old hands
got most of the plums, W. B. Walker, now
well out of the junior class, taking the
singles from F. E. Kalms, who won the title
in 1925-26 and the N.S.W. championship in
the, latter year. With Guy Williams, of
Barraba, Kalms captured the doubles title
from Walker and Breden, and then, part-
nered by Miss O’Donnell, beat Williams and
Miss Wilson in the final of the mixed
doubles.

crows and magpies, but what are these com-
pared with the hippopotami who stamp holes
in the Uganda fairways or the tigers which
sometimes constitute unexpected hazards in
India? Still, there was a little out-of-the-
way excitement in Victoria the other day
when a caddie, searching for a ball in the
rough, was bitten by a snake. There was
a doctor handy, of course, and the boy was
none the worse for his experience after treat-
ment. This is about the first recorded in-
stance of the kind, for, though snakes are
plentiful enough on many of our courses, they
seem to show a consideration for golf addicts
that is simply marvellous, considering.
* * * *
"Divot Digger’: There should be some
rare tussles between the young entry at the
next Australian golf championships, for both
in N.S.W. and Victoria the pup players are
showing extraordinary form. At Manly
recently Jim Ferrier wiped the eyes of the
other N.S.W. amateurs and the pros, to boot
by putting up a new record of 68 in an
afternoon round. This was two strokes better
than the previous best, while Fred Popple-
well’s professional record was beaten by one.
At Sorrento (Vic.). H. L. Williams, the Cab-
bage Garden Infant Phenomenon, partnered
by R. Baillieu, put up a foursome record for
a round with 71, * which, with a minus 3
handicap, gave them a net card of 68. Wil-
liams’s driving was longer than ever, one
tee shot ending dead on the pin at the 15th
hole of 280 yards.

“Carnoustie”: Modern golf innovations
are enough to make Tom Morris and Wully
Auchterlonie turn in their honored graves,
what with steel-shafted clubs, cored balls and
all the rest of the clamjamfrey. The latest
has sprung from the fertile brain of Percy
Allis, a Yorkshire pro., who was largely
responsible for the introduction of golf to
Germany. Percy has evolved a steel-shafted
club which carries the “whip” under the
hands like a first-class hickory shaft. The
“whip” in the original steel gadget is near
the head, and, though experts find this favor-
able, the mugs who make up 90 per cent, of
the world’s golfing population prefer it the
other way. This fact has probably inspired
Allis, being a Yorkshireman, to devise the
new shaft. Think of the market that lies
open to hi lit!
"Bally”: Anyone prepared to lay odds
that a women’s golf team from England
will not be seen in Australia this year is
on a good wicket. Of those invited, Doris
Chambers has declined to skipper the side
or accompany it, and others to turn the pro-
position down arc Enid Wilson, Miss Cam-
eron and Mesdames Gold, Holm and Brown.
This barely leaves a team out of tire re-
mainder of those invited. One strong objec
tion voiced is that the expense of the tour
will exhaust the Ladies’ Golf Union’s inter-
national tour fund. But surely the hosts
of the team will foot the expense bills? If
they handle the tour properly they should
get back enough to cover these and a bit
over from the gates.

“Sandwich”: The English cricketers num-
ber some useful golfers in their ranks. Ham-
mond and Brown had a day out at Roseville
(N.S.W.), and shook the opposition up. In
the morning the pair, partnered by Charlie
Macartney, played the best ball of the club
champion, T. J. Buckley, and a former cham-
pion, ,T. Hughes, winning 5 up and 4. In
the afternoon the club president, S. V.
Toose, the club captain, R. O. Nall, and J.
Hughes were also beaten, 2up and 1. Both
the Englishmen are excellent players, Brown
in particular being a very long hitter, as
he is in cricket.
Car and Cycle
“Ped.”: An idea that might be adopted
with advantage in Australia is the Freedom
from Accidents Competition conducted annu-
by the National “Safety First” Asso-
ciation. Last year over 53,000 professional
drivers entered, and over 75 per cent, got
through the year without an accident for
which they could be blamed. Entries in-
cluded drivers from the Post Office the Lon-
don General Omnibus Co. and other big
carrying concerns. The successful drivers
each qualified for a reward.

• “Hoppit”: Britain is experimenting with
a new type of roadway for vehicles. The
road is divided into three longitudinal strips
by white lines. In the two outer spaces
the slower vehicles will travel, with the
speed-hogs hitting it up down the middle.
If the outer roads are kept for horse-drawn
vehicles only, well and good, for the motor-
ists in the middle would then be free to
extirpate themselves and no one else. It is
characteristic of the times that no special
provision has been made for the unfortunate
pedestrian. The time is fast coming when
he will have to travel underground like
a wombat, or like the worm he already is in
the eyes of motorists. Even overhead road-
ways promise to be little protection, since
he is likely to be knocked off those by
aeroplanes.

Tlotham” : The Australian Tourist Trophy
races for motor-cycles on Phillip Island
(Vic.) drew the usual big attendance, which
got full value for its money in thrills. The
star turn, the Senior, over 100 miles—l 6
laps of the tricky course—was won for the
second time in succession by the Victorian
rider who prefers to blush unseen as “Reg
East.” L. S. Potts, of South Aus., who
filled second place last year, repeated the
performance, with D. Brewster (N.S.W.)
in third place. The winner’s time was lhr.
28min. 45sec. The sidecar event over 50
miles went to L. F. Pratt, of Victoria, in
tlie smart time of 4Smiu. 17sec. H. Hinton
(N.S.W.) took the Junior race over 100
miles in lhr. 32min. ssec., while L. Thomas
(S.A.) won the Lightweight in lhr. 27min.
ssec. for the 75 miles. Queensland riders
appeared for the first time, 11. Todd gaining
fifth place in the Senior.
* * * *
“Sprocket”: Young Buckley is turning
out one of the best amateur cyclists N.S.W.
has seen for some time. He is an all-round
one to boot, having won championships up
to |3O miles on the road. His latest success
was at Goulburn in the State quarter-mile
ciiaiupxonsihp, vvnicn he won all the way in
the final, beating Duncan Gray, among others,
in 30 2-ssec. Three of the State champion-
ships have now been decided, the three miles,
1000 metres and the quarter. Buckley leads
with 71 points, McGregor, of Goulburn, being
second with (H points.

“Sprocket”: James Geoghegau, the South
African amateur cyclist, now in Australia,
lias a pleasing tale to tell of the formation
of the Kimberley cycle track. When it was
being made the cluh found enough diamonds
in the disturbed soil to pay for the track and
erect handsome grandstands and dressing-
rooms. That’s where Kimberley has the pull
over its Australian opposite numbers. The
only diamonds seen on Australian courses
are on the bookmakers’ fingers, and even
then are getting scarcer, so my Tattersall
Club friends tell me.
Miscellaneous
“Decath”: An interesting new arrival in
Australian athletics is George Brooder, six
times winner of the U.S.A. javelin-throwing
championship. lie competed at the N.S.W.
championships at University Oval the other
day. and attempted to set up a new Aus-
tralian record. His throw was 181 ft. 7|in.
The Australian best is 198 ft. 7-Jin., by
Maorilander S. A. Lay at Brisbane in 1926.
However, Bronder beat the N.S.W. record of
174 ft. 3Jin., by J. F. Boyce, though the gusty
weather and heavy ground were against him.
The world’s figures are 242 ft. lOJin., by
Matti Jarvincn, of Finland.
* * * *
“Blue Chalk”: Few Dominion billiard-
players have improved so much in the past
year or two as Maorilander Clark McCon-
achy. He put up a fine performance in
London when he beat Walter Lindrum in
the final for the Gold Cup. Walter gave his
opponent 3000 points in the fortnight’s play
under baulk-line rules, but failed to pick up
the handicap, going down by 3080 points.
* * * *
“Splash” : Noel Ryan added the Australian
mile championship to his list at the national
meeting in Perth, getting over the distance
in 22min. 15sec., or lmin. 8 l-ssec. slower
than the Australian best by Arne Borg at
Manly (N.S.W.) in 1929. Ryan himself
has done it in 22min. lOsec., the record for
an Australian. He won by 40 yards from
the Victorian representative, Voekler, who
found the distance too much for him. N.S.W.
took another title when Edna Davey won
the women’s quarter-mile in 6min. 1 l-ssec.

“Spinnaker”: Owing to the tremendous
expense involved, it is likely to be many years
before another challenge is issued for the
America’s Cup. It seems likely that inter-
national yacht racing will be, for the present
at least, confined to a new competition
founded by the North American Yacht Rac-
ing Union for 12-metre yachts—39.37ft. It
will be for a challenge trophy, and will be
open to all comers, one yacht only repre-
senting each country. The first race will
be held in American waters early next
season, but the promoters do not intend, as
in the case of the America’s Gup, to compel
the challengers to come to America when
an attempt is to be made to win it; they arc-
willing to meet competitors in Europe. As
the Scandinavian countries are keen on the
12-metre type, the new competition pro-
mises to be a lot more open and interesting
than the hidebound battle for the older
trophy.
* * * *
“Blade”: The N.S.W. rowing authorities
have at last made a much-needed alteration
in the rules. In future, if a foul occurs in
an event, the umpire may stop the race and
restart the boats from the original starting-
point. Formerly he was obliged to re-
start the contest from the scene of the foul,
doing his best to determine the positions
of the different boats as they were when
the foul occurred. This naturally gave rise
to errors on the ump.’s part, with subsequent
bad feeling among the competing crews. Now
it will be a case of a new start and no favor.

“Hotham”: Some of the more ancient
among Melbourne bowlers are perturbed at
the progress of the game among the women.
The first woman’s club in Melbourne was
founded 26 years ago, and now there are
35, with a membership of over 600, which is
steadily increasing. Male players a-re dread-
ing the days when their clubs will be chal-
lenged by feminine organisations. Already
there has been a mixed tourney, and, though
the men characteristically arrogated to them-
selves the important positions of leaders, they
had by no means the better of it. Several
of the women skippered, and on occasions
rectified the mistakes of their men partners.
The time is in sight when women bowlers
are going to figure in inter-State teams

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Lennon's Hotel
BRISBANE
The Centre of Queensland
Distinguished Social Life.
Residents of Potts Point, and of Elizabeth
Bay in particular, are still seething with in-
dignation over the assassination of the old
fig-tree in Beare Park —which, by the way, is
never called by its right name. To the hordes
of children and nursemaids who frequent the
little plot, which so suggests a village green
in England, it is The Esplanade. By general
consent the deed must have been performed
by an expert. It is thought that if the
City Council added £75 to the reward of £25
which has already been offered by Alderman
McElhone, who lives in Billyard-avenue near
by, the actual perpetrator would turn King’s
evidence, so to speak, and give away his das-
tardly employer. It is claimed that the inno-
vation would pay the council in the end; that
if this tree-murder goes unpunished there
will be an epidemic of poisonings on similar
lines. There are few great trees in thickly-
populated localities that don’t annoy some-
body.
Miss M. E. Proctor. 8.A., who succeeds
the retiring Miss Miller as inspector
of infants’ schools, is an authority on
hygiene in such institutions. She has made
this the subject of research; as far back as
1914 she was doing demonstration work at
Blackfriars —the famous infants’ school
where tiny Sydney citizens are trained to
be true children of the sun. Here classes
and games in the open air are a feature of
the day, as are the health lunches and the
simplified lessons 0 n diet and hygiene. Black-
friars is a training centre for the teacher-
student, and here as well as at the Darling-
ton and Haberfield demonstration schools
Miss Proctor has put in good work. Single-
ton and Cessnock will be pleased at their
friend’s promotion; the lady was previ-
ously infants’ mistress at both towns.
This Letter must pause a moment in its
record of the quick to take farewell of the
dead. Professor Le Gay Brereton was one
of the great figures in the Fellowship of
Australian Writers. His presidency was
marked by a gentle smoothness, under which,
nevertheless, the work of the F.A.W. went
steadily forward. The tall figure of the poet-
professor, on which the clothes had the
effect of hanging loosely, will be missed not
only in the University which he graced with
his erudition but by many a hard-up writer.
Of his little charities it might be truly said
that his left hand never knew what his right
was doing.
The professorial side of Le Gay Brereton s
life was more stressed in the company at
his grave than the poetic. Perhaps that was
because the funeral was at Rookwood, and
though poets may have a lien on Pegasus
few of them possess a motor-car. The
scholar’s passing was impressive; in dignity
the panoply of death enfolded him, and as
the funeral procession passed through the
grounds of the University the stillness of
the air was shattered into brittle sorrow
by the carillon which clashed and beat and
quivered the Funeral March of Chopin.
Out at Rookwood, under a grey sky, the
grey Professor Edgeworth David uttered the
panegyric over one who had been among his
most distinguished students. Just as the
last wreath was laid on the newly smoothed
mound the sun broke through the pall of
cloud, and the grave was flooded with golden
rays. Apart from Mrs. • Brereton and an-
other member of the family, Henry Lawson’s
widow and daughter Bertha were the only
women at the graveside. _
According to immemorial custom the new
Lady Mayoress gave a tea party to the city’s
women scribes. This was held so quietly it
might almost be said to have been in camera,
but Mrs. Hagon did her guests the honor of
turning out in a smart confection of wine-
red flat cr6pe. There was further intoxi-
cating influence in the white and pink roses
that swooned about the mantelpiece; how-
ever, lest the prohibitionist in our midst
take this wrongly, let it be added that noth-
ing stronger than tea and coffee is served at
afternoon parties in the Town Hall. The
savories and sandwiches were of the rich
and rare variety. Talk was the principal
amusement.
Two brilliant lady dominies who teach
languages, etc., in the N.S.W. Education
Department, Annette McLennan, 8.A.,
and Ada Long (home villages, Hunter’s
Hill and Epping), are back in harness after
a few weeks in Hobart. Miss Long owns a
snug little shack under the shoulder of Mount
Wellington (amongst the fairy mists at Fern
Tree), and with her chum and a sister, ac-
companied by a baby motor from Sydney,
batched under the starline overlooking the
old town that’s far below. Both ladies, by
the way, took extra Uni. courses in pre-war
days in France and Germany to get an aca-
demic polish on their fluent tongue-tips.
Where Franklin Square (with the long-
ago Governor and Arctic explorer’s central
statue high above the footfalls of the passers-
by) forms a charming little patch of flower-
rimmed park, right in Hobart, Tassie
Government House once stood. Ancient
prints of it show a long two-storeyed building
with shuttered upper windows and an exclu-
sive air of hiding its lower rooms behind
lattice-work. Built by Governor Sorell in
1817. it predeceased the huge baronial pile
(built in the fifties of last century) in which
Sir Philip Game and his lady have been
holidaying as guests of the Apple Isle
Government.
Pat Thorpe’s wedding to Bill Rossell filled
St. John’s in Darlinghurst, for both have
crowds of friends and acquaintances. The
guest list, too, covered a wide area, for the
'groom is the son of the A. 0. Itossells,
of Summer Hill, while the bride is the only
chick of the George Thorpes, of Croydon.
Pat’s wedding frock is being discussed among
Easter brides-to-be; it was of magnolia
chiffon finely pleated, covered with a shim-
mering redingote of satin. This was thickly
stitched in seed pearls, and had a long train.
The vellum tinge was i-epeated in the flowing
tulle veil and an armful of suurayed lilies,
whose silver streamers fell almost to the
hem of the dress. Pink tiger-lilies and white
roses made floral alliance about the ’ altar,
while early-Victorian posies smiled demurely
from every pew. Bride’s mother received
at ‘the Forum Club, her brown laces being
the right color composition for Mrs. A. C.
Rossell’s powder-blue chiffons. The two
’maids, incidentally, were a color harmony
with the cake’s frill of lettuce-green tulle.
Empire frocks and wide crinoline hats were
of the salad toning.
Vinia de Loitte, widow of Howard Vernon,
in his day one of the most proficient ex-
ponents of Gilbert and Sullivan Australia
has known, has been telling the stories of
the G. and S. operas every Tuesday at
David Jones’s. For hundreds of tea-drinkers
Vinia, who is a clever little actress as well
as a songbird, relives the whimsies and
the satires of that evergreen partnership.
“The Yeomen of the Guard” and “The
Mikado” proved tremendously popular.

Sydney seems more than satisfied with
the new bottles into which the old wine
of “Our Miss Gibbs” has been poured. These
same bottles decant it nightly to crowded
houses, and the laughter bubbles up as irre-
pressibly, this Letter dares to swear, as
when one of her predecessors wrote of it
over 20 years ago. How light of foot,
how sweet (though small of voice) Madge
Elliott is as Mary Gibbs, the Yorkshire lass!
Her frocks, from the little grey chiffon rag,
marvellously pleated, immaculately collared,
which clothes her when she is a struggling
shopgirl, to the dewy-pink satin sheath in
which she becomes betrothed to the son of
the noble earl, are a dream. Cyril Ritchard
is just so many coiled springs, perfectly tail-
ored. The chamois bounding among the*
mountain-tops never showed a cleaner pair
of heels than Cyril does in the “Yip-I-Addy”
number.
Sydney would hate to think that the J. C.
Williamson people were being burgled of
theatres. Two heads of the Firm, ques-
tioned last week, seem not even to have
heard that J.C.W. was relinquishing Her
Majesty’s. As for other theatres that may be
going to the hammer or the lessee, “Tut,
tut!” says one magnate ; “everybody seems to
know more about it than we do. Things are
a long way off being settled. But that Pitt-
street corner has become too valuable for
a theatre site.” Presumably E. J. Tait will be
terribly surprised some morning when he goes
down to Her Majesty’s to find that the place
has been turned into a fetch-and-carry. But
won’t the invaders be more surprised if the
influence of the place proves too strong, and
all their young ladies suddenly turn into a
sprightly corps de ballet, their young gentle-
men become Lears and the middle-aged heads
Romeos and Hamlets? Even bricks and
mortar must be permeated with atmosphere
after 50 years in the show game, and there
must be ghosts of good singing, good dancing
and good drama at every turning of the old
theatre. . . • .
The American tennis-players had a great
send-off when they left by the < Aorangi last
week They made hosts of friends in Syd-
ney and their farewells were merry and
many. Joan Hartigan is very emphatic m
her approval of them, both as sports and as
charming people. U.S.A. Consul-General
Caldwell and Mrs. Caldwell staged a dance
in their honor the night before their de-
parture, when a hundred or so guests made
merry at Tudor, the Consular home in Eliza-
beth‘Bay. White angel-skin crusted with
rhinestones was the glittering raiment worn
by the hostess.
Archbishop Kelly in bronze is. to occupy
the pedestal opposite that of Cardinal Moran
at the entrance to St. Mary’s. The two
statues are the work of Bertram Mackennal,
and the artistic Papal Knight, John Lane
Mullins, arranged the commission. The
statue arrived by the Ormonde, but it will
not be ready for unveiling by his Grace s
birthday on February 13. Archbishop Kelly
will then be 83. The sculptor, by the way,
has made the statue of a corresponding size
to that of Cardinal Moran, thus increasing
the Archbishop’s inches.
When bright-faced Joan Hartigan called
in at The Bulletin office the other day, the
office photo-
grapher could-
n’t resist tak-
ing her pic-
ture. Joan
has just pluck-
ed the wo-
men’s singles
tennis cham-
pion ship
of Australia.
She is 20.
and finds the
world a beau-
tif u 1 place.
She’s the
younger
daughter of
of new Rail-
way Chief
Hartigan, and
she has played
brilliant ten-
nis since her
school days.
She was junior champion of Australia in
1931. , ~ .
Doris Fitton as the rather naughty lady m
“Caprice” wears some dreams of frocks.
She makes her first entrance in black chiffon
and lamd, finished off at the waistline by a
spray of orchids. Her afternoon frock is
of dark navy made with a short coat and
the smartest pillarbox red-and-white cape
collar, a tight little red hat and a square
red handbag. Her last entry is made
rather stunningly in an azure-blue evening
frock and a golden wig. “Good Heavens,”
says Clarence Murphy, who plays hero
opposite to her, “you have dyed your hair!”
“It has turned gold with grief,” she coldly
replies. The dress is backless, the empty
spaces being filled with an enviable little
cape that has a great starfish of silver lace
let into it. Myra Heard wears an amethyst-
ine dress that makes itself felt, and Estelle
Macken looks wistful in roseate chiffons.
Military circles will miss the cheery
Heritage couple when the Brigadier and his
lady go off to Melbourne. Like the departing
Captain and Mrs. Feakes, the Heritages have
been sustaining a round of farewells.
One of the most important was the affair at
the Victoria Barracks last Friday. The mem-
bers of the Staff Corps Officers’ Mess and
their wives were responsible for this effort,
which was very well done. Army and Navy
nabobs rolled up in battalions; the guests
were received in the garden ; there was a mili-
tary band, and a tea beyond criticism. Mrs.
O. V. Hoad, whose husband is president of
the Officers’ Mess, wore a black hat with her
frock of flat white crepe; while Mrs. Heri-
tage reversed it and wore white millinery and
a black dress.
One of Sydney’s popular invalids is Jimmy
Osborne, who is suffering a protracted re-
covery at Molong Hospital. His wife
(Maud Jeffries of other days) and son Bed-
ford wanted to keep him at Bowylie, the
family station near Yass, but the doctors
said he would work if he stayed where there
was work to do, and rest is part of the treat-
ment. He gets about in a car, and looks in
occasionally at the Union Club, but most
of his social life is lived at the hospital.
One of the brightest of the many con-
gratulatory tea-drinkings surrounding Joan
Higgins last week was spread in the Mac-
quarie Club by Mrs. Fyvie Watt. In a draw-
ing-room decked with great bowls of yellow
flowers, Mrs. Watt did the honors in a frock
of primrose-patterned chiffons. Joan was
smart in black and white and received feli-
citations and a shining array of presents —
among them two water-colors of the Harbor
from Mrs. George Earp. , These will remind
Joan of Sydney when after her marriage to
Dr. Raymond Kaines, of Adelaide, she takes
up housekeeping in Gawler.
A wide circle of friends in both Sydney
and Brisbane are grieving over the untimely
death of Mrs. Bryan Carson. Six months
ago Mrs. Carson was gaily receiving con-
gratulations on her marriage; it took place
in Brisbane, where, as Jean McWhirter,
she was one of the northern city’s
popular girls. Bast week she died in
St. Luke’s. The late Mrs. Carson was
gifted in many ways. She Avas a musician,
was artistic, and excelled* at games. To
quote a line from a contemporary English
verse-writer, the pretty young thing “lived
in love, in beauty and in mirth,” and died
all too soon —at 22.
Sydneyite Wynne Wliear Roberts drops a
note from Monte Carlo, which she has found,
despite the Casino, not all it’s cracked up
to be. Gone are the flash and the jewels and
the pretty ladies: “Everyone looks respect-
able even if they are not.” Sydney, Wynne
Roberts says, still holds its own for youth,
beauty and frocks, and Manly and Bondi are
still, in her opinion—and she has given the
onec-over to most of the Riviera —unsur-
passed as watering-places. The New Year
found Wynne in London in the matter of a
film contract.
News has come through the cables that
Vera Bedford, daughter of The Bulletin’s
old friend Randolph, lias made a hit with
the 8.8. C., and will commence broadcasting
through them next month. Vera’s voice is
not only a good one, it is an intelligent one.
The owner of it was one of the Cou.’s bril-
liant students in the Verbrugghen days. She
is also a gifted pianist, and has appeared
here in grand opera. Another former Syd-
ney girl who is stepping up in London is
Carol Coornbe, now playing a leading part
in an Elstree production. She’s a daughter
of Perth’s movie knight Thomas Coornbe,
who has just married again. His bride Avas
Frances Smith, of West Perth, before the
ceremony in St. Andrew's Church, Mel-
bourne.
There were none of your newfangled
notions about Diana Churchill’s wedding at
St. Margaret’s, ' Westminster, with' John
Milner Bailey, a son of Sir Abe Bailey, the
South African millionaire. She carried a
prayer-book bound in vellum, instead of
flowers, and the service contained the cere-
mony of the blessing of the ring, rarely used
at modern weddings. Last, and this is im-
portant to the men, the bride made the
promise to obey. However, if she had
wanted to omit it she could not, as the
obey clause is an invariable part of the cere-
mony at St. Margaret’s.
Queensland’s quantum:—
The Governor, Lady Wilson and Marjorie Wilson
were entertained at the Pier Theatre, Southport, by
the A. F. Stoddarts. The C.J. and his lady, with
Judge and Mrs. Webb, were also in the party. The
vice-regals returned from Southport to Government
House before departing for Stanthorpe to stay with
the Percy Wglkers, of Glenlyon.
Mrs. J. S. Trade arranged a party for Lady
O’Neill at Endrim, Toowong; pink zinnias and
blue hydrangeas backgrounded the bridge fables and
supper was served among red flowers. Mrs. Trade
chose blue chiffon; daughter Everil was in cherry
lace, Lady O’Neill in two tones of red. The
Macartney and Glasgow ladies, Mesdames A. E.
Moore, William Collins and Gerald Gore were among
the guests.
Mrs. Mary Graeme Boyd, the widowed daughter
of the James Loves, Glen Kedron, Brisbane, is soon
to be married in England to J. P. Blaikie Webster,
a director of Mount Isa.
In St. Andrew’s, a well-known cricketer, Dr. James
E. Phipps Hogg, Avas united to Zelma Larsen. The
bride was given away by her brother-in-law, Charles
Gamin ; she wore white bridal satin with a ’broidered
silk net veil. Mrs. Jack Dunstan, Pittsworth, was
matron of honor in daffodil satin with a wreath
of velvet roses. Marie Magee ’maided in cream lace
over pink. The Charles Gamins’ home at Annerley
saw the feasting, Mrs. Gamin acting as hostess in
the unavoidable absence of Mrs. Larsen. Cricket
emblems adorned the cake.
At Ascot a pretty frock of pink embroidered linen
was worn by Mrs. A. E. Moore; Mrs. Donald Hill-
Smith (Longreach) wore black with daffodil blouse;
Mrs. Hubert Harris (Townsville) was in navy; black
and white was worn by Mrs. D. G. Evans (Malvern
Hills). Mrs. Cadell Garrick and Pat O’Shea had
tea parties on the committee-room verandah. Mrs.
Gilbert Wilson wore navy, patterned in green flowers;
Ella O’Shea chose burnt-rose; Mrs. G. M. Ralph
wore brown and white, her daughter Eileen being in
black and white; Mrs. Victor Bell donned brown;
Mrs. H. Bonney’s ivory was patterned in cactus and
jade.
Mayor Greene presided over the Historical
Society’s Australia Day celebration at old Newstead
House, where the lawns slope greenly to the Bris-
bane River and the flower beds are full of color.
President of the society Inigo Jones presented the
historical figures appearing in the pageant —Governor
Macquarie and his spouse and Mrs. Macarthur, in a
powdered wig, were amongst those represented and
Philip Hoare recited a poem by Emily Bui cock. An
interesting address was given by Colonel F. M.
Lorenzo on the part of the military in early explora-
tion of Australia; ex-Judge Jameson, still an
excellent speaker at well over 80, told stories of
personal contact with early legal lights, and Di.
Sandford Jackson’s address was on the first medical
men in Australia. The relics and the building,
once a station homestead, were inspected by a large
gathering.

Lord Somers attended the opening of a
new ward at the Frankston Orthopaedic
Hospital, which has been equipped by the
Lord Somers Commemoration League. A guard
of honor of Boy Scouts, Wolf Cubs,, Girl
Guides and Brownies turned out to protect
the visitor, and Girl Guide Commissioners
Mrs. Norman Brookes, Mrs. Bowtell Harris
mid Mrs. Evan Pearce were there in uni-
form. After speeches had been made by
officers of the hospital, Lud Mayor Smith
opened the ward and unveiled a tablet that
marked the occasion. Lord Somers compli-
mented the league upon its effort. Mrs.
.1. G. Latham, acting-president, who wore
draperies picked out in. black and a shady
•4'liite hat, formally accepted the gift. Mrs.
Lauchlan Mackinnon, the president, who is
halving a rest on account of ill-health, put
in an appearance, and both she and Mrs.
Latham received posies. Balloons and
flowers adorned cots and wards, and some
kind friend hung a daintily-dressed doll over
each patient in the new annex. The fairy
godmother of the kiddies, Mrs. Wallace Mit-
chell, came armed with packets of ice-creams
to the delight of all the invalid kiddies, for
the day was mighty hot. League members
present were Mrs. Vary, Mrs. J. W. Chal-
mers, the hon. treasurer, W. J. Doig, and
Mrs. Doig, and the hon. secretary, R. R.
Middlecoat and Mrs. Middlecoat. Knight
William Brunton and his lady, Mrs. Harry
Emmerton, Mr. and Mrs. H. Barrett and
Miss Jean Turnbull, president of the Frank-
ston auxiliary, were in the throng.
Mollie, daughter of the Ernest Trends,
of Dunedin (M.L.), was wedded at Gram-
mar School chapel to William, younger son
of Mr. and Mrs. W. G. Tilley, of Toorak.
The bride, whose parents formerly resided
in Melbourne, wore a princess robe gown of
white flat crepe allied to a tulle veil and
orange-blossom buds. Betty Erswell, her
attendant, sported a Patou-pink gown topped
by a large hat.
Emilie, daughter of the W. N. Lanes, of
Trangie, exchanged vows with Henry, only
son of Mr. and Mrs. W. Ferguson, of the
same place at the Armadale kirk. The
bride wore white satin and Limerick lace,
with veil of embroidered net and tulle.
Millieent Lane ’maided in amber-colored
draperies of embroidered net, with a floral
cap, and a small trainbearer’s organdie frock
matched the shade. After-rejoicings took
place at the home of the bride’s uncle, O. B.
Sides, at Armadale.
The engagement is announced of Amy.
younger daughter of the C. L. Bennetts, of
Surrey Hills, to Terence, youngest son of
Mr. and Mrs. E. A. Lester, of the same
locality. The young man lives in Gympie
(Q.).
Wearing patterned green and white chif-
fon topped by a large white hat, Marie de
Bavay was hostess of a bridge gathering at
her parents’ home at Kew, as a farewell to
friends who are going holidaying in Eng-
land. Among the guests were Dorothy,
daughter of the J. K. Merritts, Barbara and
Judith Campbell and Mrs. Arthur Moore
and her daughter Betty.
Mona Barlee, in the much-discussed
comedy “While Parents Sleep,” wears some
delectable attire. A peignoir of grey-blue
chiffon, cut on princess robe lines, floats to
the ground, positively dripping frill upon
flounce. An evening gown of white brocade
is patterned in cubist design in pink, silver
and blue. A coatee that would suffice for
bridge or theatre has long tight sleeves, and
wide scarf-like drapery, bordered with brown
fur, falls like a bell sleeve over the right arm.
The hue is something between old gold and
snuff.
In an amateur performance of Noel
Coward’s comedy “Home Chat,” under the
direction of J. Beresford Fowler, Linda
Newcombe. Brenda Thomas, Loveday Hills,
Marjory McLeod and Fred Speight earned
laurels., A Grand Guignol play, “The Love
Letter,” was given as a curtain-raiser.
In our City Court the other day there
was a kidnapping case of more than usual
interest. The kidnappee, a native of Aus-
tralia and a resident of Phillip Island, was
not able to give evidence on his own behalf,
and judging by his frantic efforts to escape he
had very little confidence in the Court. He
was a young koala that had been taken
trom his leafy sanctuary by a Sydney visi-
tor, who said he wanted to make a pet of
the little bear. Police-magistrate Bond, hav-
ing heard the testimony of the police that
the defendant had treated his captive kindly,
and the explanation of the defendant that he
was ignorant of the law, reckoned that jus-
tice would be done if the kidnapper popped
a pound in the poor-box and the bear was
returned to his lawful abode. Judgment
accordingly, without costs, and a koala has
gone back to tell his mates that justice and
mercy are not unknown in the haunts of men.
The Maudsley lady, who died last week,
was on the council of the Janet Clarke Hall,
of Trinity College, was founder and first
president of the Victoria League Club, and
chairwoman of the Education Circle of the
Victoria League. She was connected with
the Lady Northcote Trust of the Uni. Con.,
was a foundation member of the Alexandra
Club and an original associate of the Royal
Melbourne Golf Club. She was the youngest
daughter of the late Canon J. F. Stretch, of
Newcastle, and sister of the late Bishop
Stretch. She left a son, Dr. H. F. Mauds-
ley, and a daughter, Mrs. Leo Miller.
The Rev. Dorothy Wilson, a Congrega-
tional minister, has come to Melbourne
on a health trip and will conduct services
at the Independent Church, .Collins-street,
during her stay. A daughter of Sir Cour-
thope Wilson, Iv.C., she is a graduate of
the Congregational College, Mansfield, and
holds the Oxford Theology Diploma. The
reverend lady is the guest of Mr. and Mrs.
Peter Tait, St. Ivilda.
Having concluded a week’s stay with the
boys in camp at Balnarring, Lord Somers
went to the Boy Scouts’ camp at Gilwell
Park, where he spent a jolly week-end.
A few nights ago a sailor in merry mood
climbed to the roof of St. Paul’s Cath-
edral. He used a ladder attached to the
scaffolding that has not yet been cleared
away. A man in blue, who also scaled the
ladder, failed to persuade Jack to descend,
and it was found necessary to commandeer
firemen from Eastern Hill to truss him and
lower him to the lawn. .From the roof the
sailor addressed the crowd, but bis remarks
were not informative. “Drunk,” was the
only charge entered against him at the lock-
up.
W. B. Mclnnes, the frequent Archibald
Prize-winner, has been commissioned by the
Castlemaine Art Gallery to go to England
to paint the Duke of York. Australia’s pleni-

its gallery, which used to be a modest apart-
ment over a bank, but for which handsome
premises were built a few years ago.

Queenscliff has an attraction for Arch-

a sort of ’busman’s holiday. He will stay

also supposed to be holidaying, for his

Adelaide has seen a literary reunion, four
survivors of “We of the Never Never” get-
ting together for a dinner, a drive and some
stockwhip-cracking. Bryant (“The Dandy”)
and McLeod (“The Quiet Stockman”) both
live at Angaston, but had not met Pearce
(“Mine Host”) and McCarthy (“Irish
Mac”) for many years. Mrs. iEneas Gunn,
their author and old friend, telegraphed affec-
tionate greetings.
English papers feature a delicate brain
operation which lasted all day and demanded
the closest attention of five doctors. Their chief
was H. W. B. Cairns, a graduate of Adelaide
University, now a brain specialist and sur-
geon on the staff of the London Hospital.
Mr. Cairns went to Oxford as a Rhodes
scholar, and rowed against Cambridge in
1920. In 1926 he was awarded a Rocke-
feller travelling scholarship and spent a year
attached to a clinic in Boston studying brain
operations.
A description of the first hospital at
Marble Bar (W.A.), given by Senator
Iviugsmill, is illuminating. It was a
canvas structure, and its operating table
was a camp stretcher; the doctor was a
young man who had just finished his train-
ing in one of London’s biggest hospitals. He
made the material at hand do, and his
operations were most successful.

S. Aus. socialities :
Mrs. Allan Simpson and her young people have
returned to Undelcarra, Burnside, after spending a
month at Victor Harbor. Mrs. J. H. Gqsse and
family, who have been staying at her parents’
summer home, Gulroy, are back at St. Margarets,
Parkside. Mesdames Roy Burston and Humphrey
Makin, after a month at Mrs. H. H. Duttons’ sea-
side residence, have returned to North Adelaide.
Mrs. Ernest Jolly, with her son Derrick, her
sister-in-law, Mrs. F. Penfold Hyland, and her small
daughter, has returned from Mount Bfeckan.
The Foundation Day races at Victoria Park were
marred by wind and dust. Muriel Hall, who helped
her father, chairman James Hall, entertain at
afternoon tea, chose a navy blue woollen georgette
ensemble and a navy straw hat. Furs were
prominent and those who ventured out in chiffons
soon had to don an overcoat.
Mrs. A. Dudley Hayward and Miss Helen Seeck,
of North Adelaide, have left on a motoring trip to
Melbourne, and will spend a few weeks at Mount
Macedon.
The Moldavia took away a number of Adelaide
folk. Mrs. J. Speding Curwen, who has been visiting
her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Otto Schomburgh, Unley
Park, was among the homeward bound. Miss
Barbara Howard, who has been on an extended visit
to relations in Adelaide, left by the same boat, her
mother Mrs. F. C. Howard and brother Robert
accompanying her. Mrs. Jack Howard (a sister of
Mrs. Speding Curwen) was also a passenger as far
as Colombo.
Lady Buckland, who, with Sir Reginald, has been
in Adelaide for a few months on a visit to her
parents, Mr. and Mrs. T. E. Barr-Smith, is leaving
for England with her husband by the Cathay.
She was given a farewell luncheon party by
her mother at Wairoa, Aldgatc, and another by
Mrs. Max Fotlieringham at her residence, Toorak.
In March, Mr. and Mrs. T. E. Barr-Smith will join
their son and daughter, T. E. and Ursula, who left
for England a few weeks ago. Mrs. H. H. Dutton,
of Anlaby, is another who departs for London on
March 9. She left her daughter behind at school
in England when she returned hurriedly to Adelaide
on the death of her husband.
Mrs. Alice Leggitt, who is quitting Adelaide to
reside in Melbourne, was given a farewell bridge
party at the Pier Hotel, Glenelg, when the floral
decorations were carried out in red, pink and
yellow gladioli. A presentation was made to Mrs.
Leggitt by Mrs. John Fisher.
.Beyond the Bight:—
A pretty bride was Becca, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Adrian Davies, who kept a tryst with Warren
Marwick on e evening in St. Mary’s Cathedral. The
long-sleeved wedding gown of ivory crepe satin was
swept by a veil of Brussels lace. The dewy bouquet
was composed of tiger lilies, white roses and maiden-
hair fern. Bride’s sister Jo, cousin Katherine Davies
and Millie Lightly stepped up the aisle in scarlet
turbans and slippers. They carried scarlet roses
against their cream satin gowns, on the corsages of
which were pinned brooches of sparklets around
ruby centres.
Even the flag high on the top of the Ascot grand-
stand wilted and was limp at the second summer
meeting. Attendance was in inverse ratio to the
mercury, which galloped well up over the century.
Mrs. Barr-Goyde was among the most attractively
garbed; her rose-beige georgettes were leaf patterned
and she wore a shady nigger -brown hat; Mrs. Roy
Mitchell wore saxe-blues; Mrs. R, Crommelin was
a cool vision in her jade-green and white with
prickings of orange; Mrs. Vetter chose brown mil-
linery with her burnt orange voile; Mrs, Pat Maxwell
allied emerald marocain with the same material in
black; Mrs. Gillespie (who is visiting her mother,
Mrs. Basil Murray), had a cape effect to her
greeny floral frock; Mrs. Lovell wore a suit of
white spun silk; Mrs. Wilford Mitchell was in navy,
and Gertrude had a floppy panama for her white
crepe de Chine.
Dick Giles returned from Adelaide after having
received the right kind of answer from Ghita
Locke. Ghita, who is an erstwhile equestrienne
of this State, now lives in S. Aus. Betty S'impson, a
very much admired lass, has given her promise to
Norman Barrett-Lennard. Dr. and Mrs. Simpson
arc now in Sydney; bells will ring soon after their
return.
A swarm of the young and vigorous packed their
holiday grips and went south for the “Bunbury
Week End.” The south-west tennis tournament was
the prime attraction, with races on Foundation
Day and dances every night. There was not much
time for sleep and crowds of visitors only managed
to be home in time for breakfast on the Tuesday.
Betty Wood defeated Miss Cullen in the final of the
women’s championship and W. Kennedy fought his
way to the top in the men’s event.
Speck speckings:—
No one had a good word for our climate on Cup
Day, when long-threatened rain came down from
morning till evening. It spoiled the gate at Elwiek,
but the T.R.C. officials got some compensation from
insurance. There was little to be seen of feminine
f rocking and adornments save mackintoshes and
umbrellas and occasional fur coats —the last par-
ticularly incongruous, for it was never cold
all day. Chairman J. A. and Mrs. Miller
entertained a flock of peopla at tea. The Lieut. -
Gov. and his lady were there, she wearing a beige
tweed suit and sable necklet. Mrs. Miller was in
black silk crepe with flesh tonings in vest and hat
trimming. Sir Philip Game and his elder boy defied
tlie weather.
Steeplechase Day brought the Cup week to a
cheerful close after the previous wet days. The
lawns and flowerbeds were a picture, and the summer
frocks and sunshades looked like flowers of a larger
bloom against the green setting. Large hats were
the chief feature of the younger folks’ wear, and
very becomingly they topped the frilly organdies and
light silks of the frocks. The G. J. Millers dispensed
hospitality.
The Harvie Thompsons had a party for 21-year-
old daughter Wilga at their pretty home in Sandy
Bay, when the drawing- and dining-rooms were
thrown into one for dancing. Wilga was in' flowered
primrose and mauve satin and sister Pat in soft pink
georgette.
11. S. East held a one-man show of water-color
sketches of the East Coast at the Launceston Art
Society’s rooms. A number of the studies found
buyers.
Anti,sts H. B. Herbert and Charles Wheeler have
been browsing about the Midlands and finding plenty
of material for their brushes, especially at Oatlands,
where the old stone houses, stone walls and ruined
windmill delighted them. Some time ago Mr.
Herbert made some capital pictures of our old stone
and brick bridges, of which there are many good
specimens throughout the island.
A well-known woman, politically, socially and
philanthropically, was Mrs. Lewis Parker, just passed
out in Launceston. Among her numerous activities
the Red Cross, perhaps, came first. Mrs. Parker was
Ainiee Archer, of Panshanger, Longford, before her
marriage.

His Blameless Youth.
BY ROBERT'R. FITZGERALD.
THAT hill, Chief, at which you arc look-
ing is Calalevu, where the fighting was.
It takes its name from that time which
was a cala leva, a big mistake. For it was
a foolish thing to resist the Government, be-
sides being most disrespectful; yea, and it
was foolish to eat men as was done at that
time and had not been done for very many
years.
Yes, sir, that was the manner of it. The
people refused to pay the taxes, and they
ate Samisoni and another who were sent out
to collect them. They ate them on that very
hill, it being a strong place only. Then
they built a fence and barricades and held;
out for a day against the soldiers who were
sent against them. The big chief, the Gover-
nor himself, came here at that time with
the soldiers. It is a thing much talked of
in Yiti to this day; but it was a thing very
foolish, as we all know now.
No, it was not long ago, not much longer:
than thirty-five years perhaps; there are
many men still living wlio were there that
day. Why, Taitou here was inside the fence,
and remembers well the fighting and the men
who were shot by the soldiers. He could
tell you of it'. And he remembers also the
eating; though he did not eat, for he was a
boy at that time, perhaps eight his years.
But it was his uncle who cut up the bodies
into pieces about the length of my forearm;
and Taitou helped his uncle dig the oven
and'helped with the firewood and the heat-
ing of the stones which roasted tliem. ' His
uncle peeled the skin off the ' pieces aftier
he had cut them up. It peeled off their
feet, Taitou says, like a' stocking peels—
a wonderful tiling to see.
1,. Chief ? I was . certainly not : behind, the
fence, I.: Always have I respected the. Govern-
ment and obeyed the Government religion;
moreover, I do not belong to that tribe. I
was down here, sir, with the soldiers, carry-
ing their food.
But no, it is not much I can tell you of
such things, nor of the old times, though it
is many my years.
It is true I am old. Yea, I remember the
time of the sickness of the measles, and
that was while Cakobau was a very big
chief and King of Bau and of all Fiji, just
before he gave the land to the British. I
remember when the flag was hoisted in these
islands and the Government came.
But no, sir, I do not remember many of
the old customs. At the time of the sickness
of the measles, when many people died, I
was young only—l cannot recall much that
went before. And always as a young man
I respected greatly the Government; yea, all
my life I have followed the Government reli-
gion. My father and my mother prayed, too,
and were Christians, for the native mis-
sionaries had been long and were strong in
that part of Macuata where I was born and
lived as a-young, man, though my tribe be-
longed here in Seaqaqa.. I myself have been
a Talatala, a native, missionary; and I know
very little of the; old. customs. . They were
a thing ashamed-of,;and people did not speak
of them; Yet sometimes when men grew angry
they forgot the things they had been taught.
There was. a chief in that part of Macuata
where I - lived who was a -very big chief
indeed and a strong, great man besides; yea,
a terrible man, oho not to be angered lightly.
Why, he was known to have clubbed some
who had merely stood accidentally in his way
—they paid for their-clumsiness with death
at one blow: His name was Ratu Sarataqa,
and he ate men like much. But at the time
I tell of he was a Christian and had not
eaten for some years. That, sir, was the
reason why the Christians were so strong
in that part, for all his people turned Chris-
tian, too, as was fit and becoming and a
matter of proper deference to their chief;
it might have been dangerous to do other-
wise. Yea, for all that he no longer ate
men, he was a proud and terrifying man
still, a very great ‘chief whom none dared
offend, but to whom all paid due and proper
reverence.
Yet once a certain youth offended-him like
much. Aisakataletu his name was, which
is a very old name; men are not now given
such names. He was usually called Aisaka ;
I knew him well, though he lived in a far
part of the district. He was about my own
age. This young man stole a girl not of
his own village, but of another village which
also obeyed Ratu Sarataqa. Such a thing
is common enough in these times, and even
now it sometimes causes trouble and ill-
feeling; but in those old days it was much
more serious; and there were war-mete sung
and war-challenges made in the two villages.
No one was killed, but it was a great trouble
and disturbance, and it, did not subside
quickly, even after it was known that it
had come to the chief’s ears and he was
angry thereat. Aisaka, who stole the girl,
was also prominent in the trouble, and the
chief was furious with him and swore that
his punishment would be a heavy one indeed.
I was there when Aisaka was trfken before
Sarataqa. He was tied hand and foot and
slung from a pole between two carriers, one
leading • and one behind; who bore the pole
on their shoulders; and he was presented
outside the chief’s house by men of his
own village, fearful of the chief, as they well
might be.
It was the night of the full moon, which
had not long risen, and the chief sat in his
house drinking yaqona. They presented
Aisaka outside the house in the moonlight;
and it was done with all due ceremony, such
as was always used when a chief was given
a bokolo , which is the word for a corpse or a
live prisoner for eating. And they gave also
a huge heap of food from their gardens,
yams, taro, all manner of food, and pinch
yaqona and some whale’s teeth, articles of a
chief-like significance; all.of which was very
becoming aind; right. Then a messenger went
inside- to Sarataqa and. using the? proper
ceremonious words, told him what had hap-
pened. And Sarataqa said the food was to
be divided up among the people, and ordered
Aisaka to be brought before him.
Aisaka was carried in trembling and
dumped on the I 'floor. He'was terribly afraid,
yet he managed to answer when the chief
spoke to him, for you must remenmer that
he was a man very respectful: it is true he
had caused much trouble, but what he
had done was the fault ; of youth and
impulsiveness and fierceness and hot
blood; he had done nothing in any
way lacking proper reverence. He did
not look up as he spoke his answers, for
that would have been most impudent; and,
besides, the chief was a fearful and terrible
man to look at for one afraid. He was a
huge ,man, a giant; all his limbs were im-
mense, and his, shoulders were as high as
most men’s heads. His great head of hair
made him seem taller still; it was trained
stiffly from his forehead and stood so high
that three handspreads might be measured
from his eyebrows to the height of it. Aisaka
just cowered; where he sat awkwardly
huddled because of the bindings upon his
limbs.
And Sarataqa was angry indeed. And, as
I have said, when men were angry they
forgot what they had.learned. So Sarataqa
; called out to the men outside: “How high 1
’ is-the moon'?’’ And they outside replied that
it had most of the sky yet to climb. “Then,”
said 1 the,chief to Aisaka, “you have still some
time to live; for I will not eat you till the
moon reaches its height.” So Aisaka was
carried outside again to wait till the chief’s
' hunger should be ready. And the chief
ordered-more yaqoria to be chewed, and sat
insider-drinking.
; All' the young men .and, girls of the chief’s
town; then) - prepared themselves for great
ceremonies to follow, for it was felt to be a
notable:: occasion. The old customs were by
no means forgotten, and all was done after
the manner of our forefathers. We painted
our limbs and made our bodies smooth and
glossy with smeared oil; and we blackened
our faces and hung ourselves with garlands
of sweet-smelling leaves. Yes, I myself was
among them and not ashamed, for it was
, both prudent and seemly to venerate our
chief and to follow in. what he-did: yea, the
Vu la tala was with us, too, and that also
was thought only proper, for if the chief
was returning to the old ways, it was right
in everyone to put from him the new religion.
So we bound on necklaces and wound wreaths
round our hair and made ourselves bracelets
and anklets of flowers. Ceremonial clubs
and spears were brought out for spear-dances
and club-dances later on ; and there was talk
and excitement and great getting ready.
Aisaka, lying bound near the door of Sara-
taqa’s house, could only wait and watch
the moon creeping up the sky. The chief
seemed to have forgotten all about him;
Aisaka could hear him inside talking of all
manner of things with the lesser chiefs who
sat drinking with him, and every little while
he could hear the decorous cries of “Maca!
Maca !■ Dry ! Dry !” as the cup was drained.
And so the time wore on.
But he had not really been forgotten; it
was merely that he was a low object beneath
the notice of Ratu Sarataqa until the moment
should come for dealing with him,, a time
which at last the chief judged had come, for
suddenly he roared aloud in his great voice:
“You outside there, Aisakataletu, I am
getting hungry—how stands the moon?!’
Now Aisaka was greatly frightened at
what was to happen to him, and frightened,
too, of that big roaring voice and of the
terrible man within, and could hardly speak
because of his terror. Yet lie knew the
respect due to a chief and that it is a becom-
ing thing to answer well a chief’s question.
He summoned all his strength that his words
might be heard, and managed to reply:
“The moon, sir, is almost at its height. I
think that it is time for the oven to be pre-
pared. Do you wish me, sir, to call : some
of the men?”
Now, those were words respectful, and the
chief heard them and loved' them greatly.
It was a speech respectful indeed to be
spoken by him who was to be-cooked in
that oven. Then the chief swore that he
would not' eat so ’ respectful a pan,, for he
loved him greatly, and loved greatly his
words and the reverence he showed for his
chief. . ..
The rain, sir, is stopping; you and your
men will be .able soon to. return to your
work on the hillside. It was fortunate that
you reached my little house in time. It is
not a real house such as we build in our
villages, just a shelter in my garden where
I can rest from my work, but it keeps away
the rain. Yet I fear, Chief, yon will be
tired from sitting so long cross-legged on
the mat, which is Fiji-fashion and not the
custom among Europeans.
What? Aisaka? He lived, sir. and for
many years, and went back to his village.
He even kept the girl whom he had stolen,
for none of her people dared make further
trouble now that it was known the chief
loved him. And thus it is, sir, that I have
never seen men eaten ; neither have I eaten
them, I. But those days are gone and no-
body now gives proper respect to- chiefs —
no, not even to the Government, for were
they not men insolent who defied the Govern-
ment at Calalevu?
Yet I have heard that even at Calalevu
there were respectful men : there is a story
told of the two who were taken to Suva to
be hanged for the affair. One, the chief,
was hanged well and so died, but the rope
failed round the other’s neck and he did not
die at once, so they told • him he- might live
if he wished. But he answered : “I know I
have done wrong. Moreover, my chief is now
dead: I wish to die with my chief.” So
they hanged him a second time and he died
thereby. That was certainly very good
behavior in him and according to.the old
custom.- "Whenever a chief died in the old
days mein were always killed and buried with
him, and they died willingly.
I think that man who was hanged was
the last-of those who ate bokolo at Calalevu,
for some were killed in the fight. At any
rate, all are dead now, though we joke some-
times and , say : “It is a brave man, the
Taitou—he eats men.” But that is a thing
of laughter only: Taitou did but help his
uncle, as I have told ; lie was too young to
eat. He smelt the roast, though: it smelt
very good, he says, much like pig; but his
uncle told him it was much better than
pig—that it was the best of all foods. That
also is true—l have heard it said; I have
not eaten, I—but eating such food was never-
theless a very- bad custom, like many others
that the Government has put down.
Yes, - there were many bad customs; in the
old days everyone was always afraid. In no
village was it happy at night the sleep. Most
villages had deep ditches dug round them
to keep off attack, but withal men were afraid
and ever watchful. Yet all the danger did
not come from- without, since men might kill
their own kinsmen if they were hungry; or
if no enemy had been slain and there was
no bokolo thereby for the chief, then some
man of his own tribe might be slain from
behind or some woman surprised at her
fishing.
It was great always the fear. Suppose a
party of men and women searching for food
in the bush should be overtaken by night and
decide to camp. They would not then dare
light fires lest an enepy should be near and
find them thereby; or if a child cried at
those times its mother would quickly
smother it or 1 strangle it lest its crying
betray them to an enemy and all be killed :
in the morning they would then cook and
eat the child. Or suppose a tribe had to
run from- some place from their foes, and
some might lag behind, being a little old,
then they would be speared by those with
them lest all be endangered by their slow-
ness. However, there were very few old
people; the old were not allowed to live,
being useless and an encumbrance to the
tribe. There were other bad customs, too,
as burying a man alive beneath' the king-post
of a new house that the house might stand
many years, or the launching of a new boat
over the bodies of living men stretched out
on the beach for rollers, thqt the boat might
be. rolled to, the sea crushing them to death
with its weight, whereby the boat-was judged
to be fortunate. Yea, though men gave
themselves willingly to these deaths to please
their chiefs, yet is it a good thing that the
Government now forbids such customs. Now
there is no war and a man may go alive from
one end of • the land to the other and meet
no foes, but friends only, though he go among
tribes whom liis ancestors fought continu-
ally. Nor,is anyone now afraid to walk
along tracks unarmed or to go alone into
the bush or to sleep out. And in our villages
at night we sleep secure and well and with-
out thoughts always of attack. Men work-
ing in their gardens do so unafraid, with no
need to glance over their shoulder?, ever
watchful of the bush around, where some
enemy might be hiding with a spear in his
hand.
For none in these days carry such spears.
And nobody is afraid. And nobody now eats
bokolo.. ..
The rain, sir, is quite at an end.
Yes, the old days were very bad. These
days are good days and the Government is
a good Government. But. .. .but the food is
not so good.


To the Man who has
Held his Job through
the Depression
THE man who has held his job
during the worst depression
the world has ever seen is in
an enviable position.
So many men have gone back-
wards during the last
three years lost their
sayings, lost their jobs,
lost their nerve. When
the depression is over, it
may take these men years
to catch up.
But the man who has
kept his job, who has kept
in direct touch with the
changes that are taking
place in business methods
—that man will be fitted,
the minute the period of
recovery begins, to make
faster progress than he has ever
made before in his life.
How can you be sure to make
the most of this opportunity when
it comes?
Danger lies in the fact that you
may become satisfied with yourself
—that you may let down just at
the moment when full steam ahead
will produce rich profits. Many
men will do this. They are spend-
ing so much energy in weathering
the depression that they will have
nothing left to offer when their
big opportunity comes.
PROOF THAT IT
PAYS
Some of the men in organisa-
tions who have subscribed to
the Institute Service are listed
below. The judgment of such
men is an argument stronger
than anything we could write.

When business takes the turn for
the better, when companies begin to
expand and take on newsmen, will
you be ready to take full advantage
of your experience and position?
The Alexander Hamil-
ton Institute has published
an interesting
book on this subj ec t. This
book points out the ex-
ceptional income oppor-
tunities for exceptional
men which will occur in
the next 5 years. It also
announces an unusual Ser-
vice, available to you in
your own office or home,
which enables you to
prepare yourself to take
advantage of these rich
opportunities.
Men who are satisfied with de-
partmental jobs and small earnings
will not be interested in this type
of Service. It is offered to the kind
of men who want to become execu-
tives of their companies or go into
business for themselves.
The book, "W&at an Executive
Should Know,” is well worth half
an hour of your time. Many men
have said that in 30 minutes it
gave them a clearer picture of their
business future than they ever had
before. Send for it to-day.
