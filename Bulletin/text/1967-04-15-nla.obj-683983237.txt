You may find a lower priced type of shipping service...but
when time means money
specify Emery Air Freight
Think air freight is an expensive way to ship? Think again. Think of faster
return of your money through faster turnover of reduced inventories be-
cause Emery can make intercontinental deliveries in two days instead of
three or four. Think of lower manufacturing costs because you can buy for
less from any distance. Think of the total operating savings for you in Emery’s
total air freight service. That’s why thoughtful businessmen around the
world are converting time into money by specifying Emery Air Freight.

ESTATE
WINE
The wine growers story of favoured vintages.
Coonawarra Estate
’66 Riesling
The success of the Rhine
Riesling vines planted at
Coonawarra Estate is shown
by this wine. Bottled within
six months of vintage, the ’66
Riesling has retained fully
the fresh, slightly ‘spritzig’
Riesling character.
Coonawarra Estate
’63 Hermitage
The ripening period of 1963
at Coonawarra was
unusually humid, which
seems to have added
subtlety to the wine, giving
it greater delicacy, yet
with a deeply satisfying full
flavour. It may well prove
to be the best Australian
Hermitage ever.
Coonawarra Estate
’62 Cabernet
Following on the 1960
Vintage, (the 1961 Vintage
was a total loss at Coona-
warra Estate) the 1962 is a
bigger wine in which the
oak-maturation and
Cabernet Sauvignon
character form a well
balanced soft symphony of
flavour.
Modbury Estate
’65 Moselle
Riesling grapes vintaged
early in March result in a
light, delicate wine with all
the best characteristics of a
true Moselle. An undertone
of soft fruitiness adds an
intriguing characteristic
which will appeal to those
who prefer a crisp, not too
dry, white wine.
Ovens Valley
’62 Burgundy
A fine, big Northern
Victorian wine grown from
Shiraz, pressed and matured
in oak for three years. Now,
after bottle-ageing, this soft,
smooth Burgundy is being
released from Wynns. It is a
superb example of the big
wines produced in this area.
Modbury Estate
’65 White Burgundy
Semillion grapes, grown on
gently-contoured Northern
slopes, and expert care have
produced this full, rich
White Burgundy. The ap-
pealing fragrance and flavour
of this vintage earns it pride
of place in any cellar.

Reminder
PERHAPS we are being over-sensitive,
but the idea of a Vietnam Cup for
the Anzac Day race meeting in Syd-
ney, with an overseas dress designer
here to judge the fashions, rather chills
the blood. There is a tradition for
naming races after past victories, but
there is no victory yet in Vietnam, and
there may never be one, at least in the
old-fashioned, banners-waving sense.
Perhaps the racing people feel it will
make the soldiers in Vietnam feel we
have not forgotten them. We feel it
might remind them that things are
going on here just the same as ever; in
fact, you wouldn’t know there was a war
on at all.
Newcomer
A BOOK PUBLISHER enterprising
enough to make his first appearance
here a few months ago, as a millionaire
at 32, and his second, shortly, as a $25
assisted-passage migrant, is obviously
the sort of person Australia needs,
although it will be interesting to see
what sort of a welcome local publish-
ing, fairly somnolent in some .sections,
gives Welshman Gereth Powell.
Sense of loss
THE ANIMALS, the Hollies, and the
Who are among the groups Perth will
miss out on seeing this year because the
Capitol Theatre is to be knocked down,
warns Aztec Services managing director
Kenn Brodziak. A few more warnings
like this and there will be moves to
have Perth’s His Majesty’s Theatre
knocked down, too.
History
A SYDNEY court case last week
seemed to touch our early history at
many points. Gregory John Blaxland, a
bus conductor, of Endeavor Avenue,
La Perouse, a former officer of the
Randwick Historical Society, was
ordered to pay $260 to the caretakers
of Bare Island museum, La Perouse,
Mr. and Mrs. Milton Powell Moore, for
alleged defamation.
Competition
THE CIRCULATION battle between
the two Sydney afternoon papers, “Sun”
and “Mirror,” is becoming so fierce and
involved that last week the “Sun had
as its chief feature, running over several
days, the life story of television per-
sonality Dick Van Dyke. “The Dick
Van Dyke Show” is the top-rated pro-
gram of Channel 9, rival to the “Sun’s
Channel 7.

If you’re wondering how we manage to cover that
many miles an hour, the answer is really
very simple. We do it by going so many places. All
at once. Just as we’re about to take off in San
Francisco, we’re landing in Hong Kong, circling over
Manila, approaching Zamboanga, serving
cocktails above Honolulu, fastening seat belts in
Australia and taxiing in to Taipei. You
can see how a thing like that adds up. So there’s
really nothing new about flying
6,000 m.p.h. We do it every day.

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
The night
the old Tiv
burnt down
I WOULD LIKE to have a good cry
over the old Tivoli, but it is not easy.
The old dear hasn’t been well for a
long time. The City Council nearly
bought the whole block of Tivoli build-
ings for $2 million back in 1963 and
last year the theatre closed as a variety
theatre and reopened as a cinema.
Last week in the middle of the night
came the fire. Your correspondent
hurried along next morning to look at
the cadaver. The mess was frightful.
The roof and the projection-room had
crashed into the dress circle.
The Bourke Street facade alone re-
mained untouched. The signs were still
aloft: “Uncensored, new,” “Angelique
returns in her new amorous adventures,”
“Road to Versailles.” There was a pic-
ture of Angelique lying naked on a bed
and one suspected that the ravages she
suffered during the fire were not the
equal of the amorous ravages she suf-
fered four sessions daily.
Unfortunately, we’re awfully good at
burning down 1 theatres in Melbourne.
They all go that way eventually. At
various times we have burnt down the
Theatre Royal, the Bijou, the Kings,
His Majesty’s, the Haymarket. The
burning down of His Majesty’s was a
pretty good fire in 1929. The only
picture that survived a singeing was a
painting of Dame Nellie Melba by
Rupert Bunny. There was almost a
mystic feeling about this. The old
diva was so formidable the flames
didn’t dare touch her.
But there has been a theatre on this
Tivoli site back to the 1850 s, and it has
outlasted all the old ones: the Theatre
Royal opposite with its mirrors and
saucy wenches out the back and the
Bijou which was said to be terribly
opulent with red satin and plush.
Originally the Tiv was the Varieties
Music Hall and it was here in the
golden ’fifties that the excited diggers
threw their nuggets on the stage. Next
it became the Alhambra, then the Opera
House, and in 1900 (Dammit, you’ve
guessed already) it was burnt down.
Harry Rickard, the marvellous
comic singer and entrepreneur, rebuilt
it for £13,000. The “Argus” purred
about the glories of the new Opera
House. It wasn’t Renaissance like every
other piece of architecture in town; it
was Moorish with splendid Moorish
arches. There were spandrels, there
were arabesques, there was a gold dado
and the walls were hung with handsome
gold paper richly embossed with flowers.
On the way to the dress circle there
were ferns and a fountain.
Furthermore, the carpet was the
same as the Duke and Duchess of Corn-
wall and York used in the Ophir on
their Royal visit, no less.
Your correspondent, as he thumbed
through the old “Argus,” was most
impressed with the advertising. Mr.
Rickard had gusto. For the opening
day, May 18, 1901: “Absolutely the
most gigantic and magnificent first part
ever designed in Australia. The most
gorgeous and luxurious ever devised in
any part of the world.” Then for the
star we had London’s idol Marie Lloyd
in her first appearance: “Absolutely the
most marvellous artist the world has
ever seen.”
The “Argus” on Monday clearly
adored Marie Lloyd, but there was a
suggestion of alarm about Miss Lloyd’s
bracket of five songs “Some of the inci-
dents she described were not such as
would meet the approval of the prim.”
Another critic found her songs “irre-
deemably vulgar.” “Coarseness may at
times be associated with wit, but the
songs to which the audience was treated
on Saturday night did not even have
the saving grace of humor.”
She sang “Dear Little Shamrock”
and “Robin Adair,” but there were other
songs that went like this:
“Where’s the harm, where’s the harm,
Will anyone tell me, pray,
If the sexes bathe together
In the beautiful summer weather . . .”
Yes, as the “Argus” said, Marie
Lloyd could interpret “with an archness
and a meaning that few singers knew
how to infuse.”
On Monday Harry Rickard took an
ad to announce, “Everyone is saying:
The seating is unsurpassed, the line of
Dick Bentley
sight is perfect, the corridors are
unanimously admired . .
Prices of admission were 3s, 2s, l/6d,
and Is, and 6d for matinees. Harry
Rickard paid salaries on Mondays just
to make sure that all performers were
present and correct on Saturdays. He
was superstitious, forbade the chorus to
wear yellow and black and he was ter-
ribly cautious about Fridavs and the
number 13. Which, no doubt, was very
wise of him because he died on Fri-
day, October 13, 1913. The building
didn’t change but it was renamed the
Tivoli in 1914, in line with Harry
Rickard’s other Tivoli in Sydney.
We could sentimentalise for ever
about the people who performed there.
Little Tich dancing in his three-foot
boots was paid an unbelievable £250
a week in 1905. Ada Reeve had a salary
of £3OO a week, and Harry Musgrove
paid Tommy Trinder and George
Formby £lOOO a week. W. C. Fields
performed in 1903 before he went to
Hollywood. It was about 1905 that we
saw Houdini. As a splendid publicity
stunt he had himself manacled and
strait-jacketed and he jumped off
Princes Bridge into the Yarra. In 1908
Rickard booked Tommy Burns, who
regrettably failed to win the world title.
Then he had Jack Johnson, who did win
it. The crowd booed Johnson as he came
on stage.
“Ladies and gentlemen, I came to
your lovely Australia to fight and win
the world’s championship. I have done
so. Could I do more?” This was very
good P.R. The audience then stood and
cheered him.
There were other names: Sandow the
strong man; Lily Langtry, the Jersey
Lily; George Robey; Chico Marx; Allan
Wilkie, right through to Roy Rene,
Athur Askey and Dick Bentley.
The big question now is what will
happen to the old Tiv? The present
managing director, Gordon Cooper, is
not saying anything. However, the
chances are that it could come back
as a picture theatre. After all, the old
Opera House staged Melbourne’s first
movie in 1896 and we had some jolly
good Boer War films there around
1900.
But look, the movie-picture business
here has never been so prosperous in its
history. Picture theatres are being built
and rebuilt all around the city. Just
around the Tiv, we have the Palladium
Centre with two new theatres, we have
the Bercy, the Paris, and the Esquire.
Over the road, Hoyts are building a
s4m. cinema centre with three theatres
with capacities of 960 seats, 840 seats,
and 800 seats. The cycle has taken a full
turn. Why, business is so good in
motion pictures the standard line is that
soon they will be converting bowling
alleys into cinemas.
The point at this stage is not to let
Mr. Cooper lose heart. With a little
encouragement I am sure he could put
up something gigantic and magnificent
with furnishings that would be superb,
with seating unsurpassed and corridors
that would be unanimously admired.

A Parini suit costs

The pleasure of any possession that is the product of
genius is worth a lot of money. In Parini suits, this is
what you buy. Luxurious fabrics, selected regardless
of cost, wherever they can be found. Craftsmanship
upon which that expensive commodity called time is
never allowed to impinge, because Parini tailors are
perfectionists. Craftsmen of the old school now
all too few around the world.

SYDNEY
BY DAPHNE GUINNESS
A taste of
the big
banana shape
THE FACE OF THE MOMENT
stares unemotionally from under
cropped short back-and-sides hair
which, in profile, balloons into an in-
flated sausage. It stares from above
flat chests, exposed knees and thighs
encased in pearl-white lace stockings,
themselves encased in thick-set shoes
that clump up and down Sydney’s pave-
ments.
The Face of the Moment arrived for
testing in the Metropolitan Area some
four weeks ago, preceded by a rash of
advertisements displaying a naked girl
covered with fourteen essential black
daisies. Not since the launching of in-
stant tanning has a cosmetic caused
such a commotion. England’s Mary
Quant may be labelled eccentric by
some and gimmicky by Balenciaga, but
if anyone has proved misplaced the
belief that Australians are slow to ex-
periment with new sophistications of
life, it is she.
Not that The Face is everyone’s cup
of tea. We have heard reports of dis-
turbed gentlemen, on lunchtime per-
ambulations round the city, showing
signs of distress at the sight of teenage
Greta Garbos, their faces all deep-
socketed eyes and no mouth, their noses
shining, shining bright. One executive
failed even to recognise his secretary
in her new face, and another inquired
of his Miss Jones if she knew she had
a dirty mark on her chin.
But such was the onslaught on stores
(David Jones, for one, sold 60 percent
more than they anticipated) that Aus-
tralian distributor Raymond Mullis’
original sales target of $lOO,OOO was
passed in the first two weeks. He was
then put in the annoying, expensive
position of having to air-freight replace-
ment stock fro,m England by the day.
This week, however, a ship sailed in
with around $200,000 worth of Quant
cosmetics, some for Sydney, some for
other States where two Quant-trained
girls have spread the story of the face
to come.
With the product, packed in mod
black-and-white cases and which, says
the accompanying blurb, “is a whole
new concept in make-up,” there comes
a whole new set of phrases. We are not
suggesting they will outdo anything as
established as Strine, but for future
cordial communication between men
and women we think it is as well to

know that, for instance, “big banana
shape” has absolutely no connection
with what is coming for tea: it is shad-
ing in the hollow of the eye.
“Hurly-Gurly” means a mouth cov-
ered with half neon-red and half neon-
pink, or alternatively, for the sake of
breaking monotony, “skitzo” will do.
“Twiglets” are not cocktail biscuits and
were thought of, so we are informed,
long before that Other Girl, Twiggy,
came on the scene. They are, in fact,
false lashes painted on underneath the
base of the eye. “Starkers” is Quant lan-
guage for old-fashioned foundation (as
in cream), and “boning” means the
polishing of the cheek, chin, and eye-
bones.
According to Miss Quant’s staccato
space-age instructions, there is nothing
one cannot do to a face that has no
beauty to recommend it, but has many,
many defects to hide. We can slim
to nothing our unfortunately shaped
nose, obliterate our sagging jawline, re-
mould entirely our fat face. Our mean
lips can become sexy, our cheekbones
higher, our cheeks look devastatingly
hollow. And our shallow forehead, pro-
vided it is not covered with hair, can
be rounded out; and if it is covered
with hair, our close-set eyes magically
widened.
The disturbing thing is that having
bought sixteen dollars’ worth of this
morale-lifting product, and having
Designer Mary Quant
learnt to apply it so that one does not
look like a clown, we may eventually
have to rethink the entire situation.
At the end of Miss Quant’s blurb is a
gay little message which reads: “That’s
the lot for now! Nothing fussy, no un-
necessary bits and pieces, absolutely
nothing old hat just the essentials for
today’s look (and the newest ideas).
And when the look changes so will my
cosmetics. Newies will happen all the
time. So watch it!”

Competition
in the
auction room
THE WHOLE SPLENDID TONE of
this year’s Barossa Festival was set by
a prominent lady who had never before
visited the area. Driving along the road
to Tanunda surrounded by vineyards,
grape pickers, busy wineries, and the
sights, if not the sounds, of incipient
festivity, she found herself following a
large battered grey truck which was
loaded with some White Shiraz grapes.
“Look at that!” she exclaimed quite
seriously. “With the Festival on, you’d
think that they would paint the truck
a different color to show off the grapes
better!”
This perhaps does reflect the rose-
colored attitude of many who attended
this year’s Festival. They had come to
enjoy themselves and, by Bacchus, they
were going to enjoy themselves.
But the Barossa, indulgently putting
up with its visitors, intended to strike
back. A gigantic ambush had been
laid. For, on Friday, 31st March, at
1400 hours, there was an auction of
Rare Australian wines!
They did the thing properly. The
night before, 180 dinner-dressed guests
and 20 scruffy Sydneians (having left
their glad rags at home) sat down to a
$l5 dinner. The oysters and whiting
were splendid, cold buffets had sur-
vived the journey from Adelaide, and
there were nearly 100 wines to taste.
Auction wines were served throughout
the dinner, and then we were turned
loose upon three great rows of the rarer
vintages after an exhortation by the
auction chairman, Mr. Peter Lehmann,
to think of the others. Incredibly, of
the two bottles only of each rare wine,
there were some unopened bottles still
at the end!
This was the fourth auction of note
in the past two years. Interest in them
was resurrected by the Barossa Valley
Festival Committee in 1965 when they
sold a haphazard but interesting col-
lection of wines that achieved fair
prices. The table wines sold well, some
over £1 a bottle, but there were many
bargains among the dessert wines. I
remember buying some wonderful
Hoffmans Old Port for only 6/- a
bottle and a ’34 Yalumba Sauternes for
10/-.
In 1966 to celebrate Wine Week the
Chevron put on an auction with the
co-operation of the industry, and the


Linde man's

PRIZE-WINNERS
wines were truly representative: ’54
Richard and ’52 Pinot Hermitage from
Mount Pleasant got between $5 and $6
a bottle and the top table wine price
paid was for a ’53 Grange at $7.60 a
bottle. A bottle of 1890 Muscat sold
for $l7.
Then a few weeks ago the Ruther-
glen area displayed many of its old
wares in a slightly hysterical auction
which fetched high prices from the well-
heeled Victorians. “What am I offered
for this old bottle of Chambers Muscat
which sold for $l7 in Sydney? We can’t
let them beat us, can we?” They got
$22 for it.
So the scene was set.
At 1400 hours we trooped dutifully
into the number 2 cellars of Kaiser
Stuhl Wines, which had been most suit-
ably decorated for the purpose with
pieces of Rare Old Equipment. The
ladies were asked to sit on the upturned
ends of barrels, which left quite an
impression on them. Wine-hearty greet-
ings were exchanged, though one could
sense the malice underneath. “Oh, he’s
here. Blast! I can write off Lot 72!”
The first lot was a dozen of the very
same Hoffmans Port that I had bought
for 6/- two years previously. It fetched
$2.
Reality cold-showered us at lots
7 and 8. Three bottles of Maurice
O’Shea Mount Pleasant 42 “T.Y.”
Hermitage from Yalumba’s museum,
$2B a bottle! Three bottles of Seppelts
1892 Port, $3O a bottle! From that
point my interest in the auction
remained, but my excitement at being
able to purchase rare and beautiful
wines died.
The auction, capably and splendidly
conducted by Mr. lan Bruce, of
Adelaide, appreciated nearly $BOOO, of
which quite a whack will go to charity.
Major bidders were Mr. Keith Water-
man, of 408 Beverages, Adelaide, who
purchased one thumping lot of 100
dozen and many rare old ports around
the $2O per bottle mark, and the multi-
faceted Mr. Derek Penfold-Jolly. He
bought many interesting lots, mostly
reds, for his store and restaurant. These
two gentlemen tended to upset the
plans of one or two syndicates who
had hoped to buy lots to be split
among them. Perhaps this was just
as well, for on one occasion when our
syndicate was given a chance to
purchase we bid against each other.
A call for an old Frontignac was
made from the far side of the room,
which I raised to $1.25. My opponent
bid $1.50 and I realised that it was
Bob Raymond, Director of Channel 9’s
“Project ’67” and a member of our
syndicate.
“Hey!” I shouted.
“$1.75 on my right,” said the
auctioneer.
“What?” called Raymond.
“$2.00 on my left,” said the auc-
tioneer.
“You idiot!” I cried.
“I’ll take that as a bid,” said Mr.
Bruce as he knocked it down for $2.25.
All the auctions have achieved con-
siderable publicity for wine, and charity
has benefited manifestly on a couple
of occasions. Does this give a prominent
place to auctions in the future?
George Kolarovich, the technical
manager of Kaiser Stuhl and vice-
president of this year’s Festival Com-
mittee, says:
“I hope they continue. There are
not enough wine museums or libraries in
Australia. Wine-makers are proud
people and I am sure would make very
special wines in small quantities for
auction-selling. In Europe auctions
are far more important than any wine
show and I would like to see the day
here when they become as significant.
The wine-auction trend must drive us
back to respect quality and this is most
important. And though I support the
charity angle I would also support the
purely trade angle in which brokers
buy wines both in bottle and bulk.”
Prominent Barossa Valley innkeeper
Mr. Frank Nicholls, who runs the excel-
lent Angaston Hotel, agrees. (He bid
for a number of wines and secured a
couple of excellent reds.)
“I am building up my cellar, as I
always have tried to do, but I find
that as soon as I get something excel-
lent my customers want the lot. I like
to serve a representative collection of
matured wines in my dining-room and
undoubtedly auctions would help me do
this.”
Peter Lehmann, the chairman of the
actual auction committee, thought the
prices were too high and inflated by
enthusiasm. Not dismayed, he would
like to see the Barossa Valley the
auction centre of wine in Australia (and
agrees with me that they should be held
at least once a year) with wines from
every area.
While I would like to see auctions
continue and to become more frequent,
perhaps they could be conducted as a
mixture of overseas auctions.
In the morning, say, different gallon-
ages of young wine in bulk to be sold
and to be bottled at the right time by
the selling company for whoever pur-
chases the lot.
A rest for refreshment, then a number
of rare wines to be sold in the after-
noon. There is a need to know what
old wines will bring and the auctions
could prove the means of fulfilling it.
This system has been maintained in
London for years (even Christies, that
venerable institution, has started selling
wines by auction again after a break of
over 20 years. They first started auction-
ing wine in 1766!).
Back to the Barossa. I don’t think the
attending public knows how hard the
vignerons work at this affair. They are
in the middle of vintage and yet their
hospitality to, and enthusiasm for, the
visitors is simply amazing. Hard work
is added to hard work. On Sunday there

OVER 30 YEARS EXPERIENCE BEHIND EVERY FLIGHT
ON THE
MARGIN
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
His slits
widened to
mere eyes
“EYEBROWS were raised when Prin-
cess Margaret appeared in a mini-skirt,”
says a report from London. Though I
was not present on this royal occasion,
I doubt the accuracy of the report. Con-
ceivably some spectators were surprised
and disapproving when they saw the
Princess’ garb (though it is a bit late to
be surprised by what she wears). But
from my observations, people do not
usually express surprise and disapproval
by raising their eyebrows. They are
more likely to lower them.
The eyebrow-raising cliche is of fairly
recent date. A generation ago eyebrows
were not raised, though eyes often
bulged or popped. Eyebrow-raising
came in about the same time as taking
long, hard looks, grinding to a halt, and
pulling no punches.
I am a member of the Anatomical
and Physiological Sub-Co,mmittee of
the An ' ralian Cliches Advisory Board.
Our Si. .-Committee has recommended
that the Board withhold its approval
from eyebrow-raising; also from the
curling or biting of lips and the gritting
of teeth.
There is a literary tradition that a
person’s lip curls when he or she feels
scorn or contempt. I have been able
to observe people looking at me with
scorn or contempt on a number of
occasions. They have included distin-
guished men and beautiful women. It
was noticeable that their lips never
curled; they showed their attitude by a
sort of immobile calm.
The alleged biting of lips (preferably
till the blood comes) as a symptom of
rage must be regarded with similar
scepticism. There may be some who do
it, but I have never encountered a lip-
biter, and I have seen many enraged
persons editors, wing-commanders,
wives, football spectators.
As for the cliche that determined
people grit their teeth, its accuracy is
hard to confirm. The verb “to grit,”
according to the Oxford Dictionary,
means “to produce a grating sound as
of the crushing of grit.” This sound,
when produced by teeth, is not easy to
hear except under favorable conditions.
I have never heard a determined per-
son grit his teeth, nor have I had
enough determination to grit my own.
Many writers state that a determined
person also “squares his jaw.” This feat
is possible to only a few. If your jaw

happens to be round, you cannot make
it square however determined you feel.
Speaking of jaws, it is doubtful whether
the jaws of people drop in astonish-
ment as often as novelists say. The same
authors tend to exaggerate the pre-
valence of pouting among girls. The
female pout (“a protrusion of the
lips”) was more common in days when
men said “Pshaw.”
Different parts of the body have their
own sets of cliches. The eyes may be
wide (in innocent or idealistic persons)
or may narrow to mere slits (if their
owner is cunning or sinister). Our
Sub-Committee does not favor these
expressions. There are many conflicting
instances of wide-eyed rogues and slit-
eyed idealists.
On the other hand, we take a tolerant
view of more fanciful cliches that are
not meant to be taken literally. Few,
if any, idle people actually pass the
time by twiddling their thumbs; nor
do industrious ones keep their noses
to the grindstone. Likewise, the un-
hygienic practice of having a finger in
the pie is rare today. Yet all these
phrases serve their metaphorical pur-
pose.
Pectoral cliches
An odd cliche of the same class is
the rising of hackles. Not all those
whose hackles rise know what hackles
are (they are the neck-feathers of a
cock). There are also two curious
pectoral cliches making a clean
breast of it and unbosoming oneself.
These are strictly one-way. It is not
idiomatic to make a dirty breast of it
or to bosom oneself.
The cliches to which our Sub-Com-
mittee takes objection are those that
are meant to be realistic but aren’t.
Bottom-pinching, for example. This
behaviour is referred to frequently in
books as a standard manifestation of
male libidinousness. In real life such
pinching is resented. There are many
ways for a man to make a good impres-
sion on a young lady, but bottom-pinch-
ing is not one of them. Like pouting, it
is less usual than novelists believe.
All these anatomical and physiologi-
cal cliches, however, may be growing
less false with time. As Wilde said,
nature imitates art. People who read
that eyebrows are raised as a sign of
surprise may begin to raise them. They
may also, when they have the
appropriate feelings, curl their lips, grit
their teeth, drop their jaws, narrow
their eyes to mere slits, pout, and even
- however unwisely pinch bottoms.

AUSTRALIA
Malaysias Tun Abdul Razak:
a quiet methodical egalitarian
TALKING ABOUT THE arrival in
Australia this week of Malaysia’s Deputy
Prime Minister, 45-year-old Tun Abdul
Razak, a Canberra official recalled that
when working in Kuala Lumpur he had
mentioned to Razak at a party that he
iwas expecting a reply from one of his
departments about a relatively unim-
portant clarification of a small request:
Razak at once recalled the date of his
department’s letter in reply. It turned
out that he was exactly right. The
letter had been mislaid at the Australian
High Commission.
1 With the stern, dignified appearance
of a headmaster or a Customs official,
Razak is a politician who loves the
details of administration more than
making speeches. He finds it difficult to
project his feelings or open his heart.
But in Kuala Lumpur they see “the
Tun” as the man who makes the admin-
istration tick.
Hostile reporters can expect sharp
answers if they question him during his
ten-day tour of Australia about Viet-
nam or Communist insurgency in
South-East Asia. He is said to have
given Dr. Jim Cairns an uncharacter-
istically hot blast last year when, on
tthe Australian parliamentarians’ visit,
Cairns said that Australia was sowing
seeds of resentment among Asians be-
cause of its military involvement in
Asia. But, apart from thanking Austra-
lians for their assistance to Malaysia,
3 the Tun wants to get down to details
jin discussing with Australian officials
this country’s economic development.
1 Although he is also Minister for
(Defence, it is to his Department of
Rural Development that the Tun
mainly devotes himself. His control
system for development projects has
lecome internationally famous. The
planning is more down-to-earth than
that of most countries, but what is
unique is the system of control by
jvhich he sees that plans are actually
j carried out. Through a series of
military-style “operations rooms” the
Tun keeps detailed tags on the progress
of every development project in the
country, from a timber road in Perak
|to land clearance in the Jengka tri-
angle. Through charts and huge “Red
Books” three feet by two any delays
i or difficulties are immediately recorded,
so that the Tun can turn up by heli-
copter, unannounced, at a provincial
The Tun in his “operations room”
operations post and demand to know
what is holding things up.
The Tun’s pragmatism represents a
new kind of Asian leader. The belief
is spreading throughout the nations of
South-East Asia that once the charis-
matic, oratorical leaders have done
their stint of nation-building it is time
for the quiet, subtle types to get on
with the hard administrative work of
planning economic development. In
Indonesia this is the way things now
seem to be going. The chauvinist Suk-
arno has been succeeded by a very
Razak-like figure in General Suharto,
cautious and quiet, bad at all aspects
of the political art of mass communi-
cation. Since separation, Singapore’s
Lee Kuan Yew has quietened down a
lot, making fewer stirring speeches, giv-
ing more attention to matters such as
trade expansion. Even in Saigon, Dr.
Phan Quang Dan, the principal leader
of the Constituent Assembly has called
for the end of the great-man approach.
But Razak isn’t just a very hard
and purposeful worker. Unlike the
aristocratic Tunku with whom he has
worked so closely, the Tun is something
of an egalitarian, opposing the ex-
penditure of money on prestige projects
like the magnificent, but grossly under-
utilised airport. A story has it that he
once said: “We need the old order to
maintain social stability while we raise
up the simple people of the villages.
We need about 20 years for this. But
once the job is done, we can take all
these damned princes and titled aristo-
crats and chop off their heads.”
Lions
For peace
SYMBOLICALLY, THE week-long
visit of Lions International President
Edward M. Lindsey to Australia had a
dual purpose: to boost Lions’ campaign
for world peace and to present a
$75,000 cheque to Southern Tasmanian
Lions for fire relief work.
The peace effort is designed to mark
the 50th anniversary of Lionism and
was instituted by Lindsey at his in-
auguration as President in Tennessee
(U.S.A.) last July. Central to the
effort is a 5000-word Peace Essay Con-
test which 20,000 Lions Clubs in 136
countries have been promoting and con-
ducting since last August.
The peace campaign is also a shrewd
piece of public relations. The American-
produced “Manual of Procedure for
Conducting the Peace Essay Contest,”
issued to all Club Presidents, instructs
them to use the contest as a means to
“promote the image of the Lions
throughout the world.”
The second string in the Lions peace
bow is the people-to-people project of
clubs with South Vietnamese “com-
munities.” Once the “marrying” of
towns has occurred, it is not yet clear
what will ensue, although Lindsey
announced last February that there
would be “a two-way exchange of two-
way ideas and philosophies.” Though
Lions claim they are non-partisan in
politics, Lindsey clearly approves the
Edward M. Lindsey


American effort in South Vietnam, and
sees this Lions’ project as support for it.
Meanwhile, the other facet of Lions’
work—community service—remains in-
tact. Lindsey (who referred to Lions
in his Inaugural Address as “the greatest
service club”) assured Canberra Lions
last week that the peace program would
not detract from this more traditional
role of Lions Clubs. Such assurances
are not likely to cause surprise to clubs
which are already operating at total
capacity on community projects—in the
Sydney district, Dee Why Lions are
conducting an appeal for $40,000 for
a young scoliosis victim who must be
sent to Los Angeles for treatment.
Australiana
The Mackaness
collection
THE GEORGE AND ALICE Macka-
ness Collection of Australiana is, in the
words of publishers Angus and Robert-
son, “one of the biggest and best in
Australia.” A. and R.s have just
released the first catalogue of the col-
lection. Dr. Mackaness and his wife have
20,000 books in their three libraries, so
there may be up to ten catalogues
released, one a year, before all the
books are sold.
There are 1193 books listed in this
first catalogue, and after being on sale
for only four days 800 of the volumes
had been sold. This enormous and grow-
ing interest in Australiana —books, maps,
lithographs, anything—is good news for
collectors. Since 1960 half a dozen or
so big Australian collections have been
dispersed. One was Mr. F. G. Coles’
library of 924 books, which were sold
for $96,000. Top price was $2OOO for
“Birds of Australia and Norfolk Island”
by G. M. Matthews. Half the collection
of Mr. H. H. Dutton, of “Anlaby
Station,” was sold in 1966, and his
“Mammals of Australia” by John Gould
brought $25,000.
The books which bring the highest
prices are often personal recollections
of early Australia. For instance, in the
Mackaness Catalogue, John White’s
“Journal of a Voyage to New South
W 65 coloured plates of non-
l Animals. Lizards, Serpents,
Curious Cones of Trees and other
Natural Productions,’* was sold for $320.
For $7OO was a satire called “An
Object of Pity or The Man Haggard, a
Romance by Many Competent Hands.”
(Real author was Mr. Bazett Michael
Haggard, British Land Commissioner
in the 1890 s.) Prices are not all so high
in fact, there are quite a few books
listed at $3, many of which will increase
in value as time goes by.
Dr. George Mackaness, a fourth-
generation Australian, started his col-
lection when he was twenty. He and
his wife have travelled all over Austra-
lia to find rare volumes. Dr. Mack-
aness, who has doctorates from Sydney
and Melbourne Universities and an
OBE, has written 78 books himself. A
complete set of his Australian Histori-
cal Monographs is listed in his catalogue
as “extremely rare” at $5OO.
The biggest collections of Australiana
are of course in the Dixon and Mitchell
libraries. Sir William Dixon gave 61,000
volumes, maps, views, and pamphlets
all valuable Australiana to the
library in 1910. His pictorial history of
early Australia is unique.
“Imagine if one could point to a
painting in England and say ‘That is
the first-known painting of London’,”
said Mr. Williams, joint general mana-
ger of Angus and Robertson, and an
expert on Australiana. “Such a painting
would be beyond price. In the Dixon
gallery are the first drawings of Syd-
ney, the first painting of Sydney done
by a convict. People are just beginning
to realise the importance of this. It’s
fantastic.”
Fashion
The Male Look
THIS WINTER WILL be an exciting
one for Australian men, if they follow
the advice of Pierre Cardin and the
Wool Board’s full page color adver-
tisements in the national dailies.
“The undistinguished look is
finished,” they tell us. “The Male Look
’67 is here . . . strong, striped, double-
breasted.”
Australian suit manufacturers are un-
derstandably enthusiastic about this
decree. DBs and three-piece suits use
a lot more material than the slim line
two-piece which has been worn for the
past few years.
Unhappily, the Average Australian
Male is sticking, by and large, to his
two-piece. Anthony Squires, who make
2500 suits a week, report that only one
percent of their suits are double-
breasted, and a slightly larger percent-
age are three-piece.
Mr. Nott, of Frieze Bros., Melbourne,
says about one-third of his firm’s suits
are three-piece. “That’s because we
cater for the right kind of young man,”
he explained. “Not the long-haired,
scruffy sort.”
Three-piece suits sell better in Mel-
bourne, Adelaide, and Perth than they
do north of the Snowy. Perhaps Syd-
ney men obey the dictates of the cli-
mate rather than Cardin.
Ernest Hiller is manufacturing an
elegant Hardy Amies DB in Australia,
but it appeals only to the select few.
“The trend is there, though,” said
Mr. Duncan, marketing manager.
War veterans
A coming of age
ANZAC DAY, 1967—21 years after the
war in the Pacific will mark a dis-
tinct change in RSL outlook. This week
the Australian veterans are host to 24
of their fellows from South-East Asian
and South-West Pacific ex-service
organisations. From their welcome
in Sydney by Sir William Yeo,
president of the N.S.W. branch, to
receptions and addresses by the top
political brass in Canberra and Mel-
bourne, the Asian and Pacific veterans
have found themselves on a pleasant
but slightly bewildering familiarisation
tour, with only occasional discussions
of ex-Service matters.
After hearing speeches by everyone
from the Governor General, Lord
Casey, to Housing Minister Dame
Annabel Rankin, the visitors were to be
whisked away on visits to Wollongong,
the Snowy, and Melbourne with side
excursions to artificial limb and appli-
ance centres, one talk by the Repatria-
tion Minister, and one conference ses-
sion devoted to a scheme for selling
their own ex-servicemen’s handcrafts in
Australia, one to Colombo Plan aid for
rehabilitation training.
Finally the 24, who include Dato
Abdul Rahman, of Malaysia, serving
military men from Indonesia (the Con-
ference might have been held in 1963
but for Confrontation), and Mr. Law-
rence Konimoro from New Guinea,
will be guests of the RSL for the Anzac
Day March in Sydney. They will watch
from a balcony of Sydney Town Hall,
and fly home next day.
Critics of the RSL might wonder
why the Veterans’ Conference did not
go all the way and invite Japanese
veterans in a grand gesture of forgive
and forget. That time may come, if
the other Asian and Pacific veterans
agree. Meanwhile, the RSL in Perth
has invited the Japanese consul-general,
Mr. Tanetani, an army officer in
World War 11, to place a wreath on
the State War Memorial on Anzac
Dav.
Sir William Yeo of the R.S.L.


Army Minister Fraser (centre), in Vietnam, sees Communist
weapons, including punji stakes, at right
Laying it right on the line
ARMY MINISTER Malcolm Fraser,
Jhe clean-cut farmer’s boy already noted
for his outspoken and frank statement
on the problems of the most difficult of
the junior Ministerial portfolios, has
laid it on the line again.
Late on Tuesday evening three
hours after the ABC had lifted the
lid a little and let some steam out
Fraser called an impromptu Press con-
ference to reveal that half of the Aus-
jtralian front-line troops in Vietnam
‘from June would be National Service-
m€ l n ’ , , . , , , ,
I It is doubtful whether Fraser called
the journalists together to make this
specific point. What he wanted to clan y
(as the ABC had pointed out) was how
i National Servicemen on a percentage
(basis were being killed at almost twice
x r
.the rate of regulars.
! His explanation that National Service-
men because of their limited period in
the Army could not be trained for the
specialist, skilled “behind the lines”
positions (the confines of the “profes-
1 sional brass” as one critic later cynically
put it) carried him the inevitable step
I forward on to soft ground.
In characteristic fashion he did not
duck. Yes, he said, this meant most
National Servicemen would be f ron t-
line troops It also meant that still
more would be front-line troops after
i J une . wh . m the ne « Task Fo . rce ™ th lts ,
increased commitment of National
Servicemen (33 percent against 25 per-
cent in the old Task Force) went into
action
“It is possible that more than 50
percent of the men in the field will be
National Servicemen,” Fraser said. “It
is not impossible that in some combat
actions National Servicemen would
comprise above 50 percent of the troops
in action.” (At present, National Ser-
vicemen comprise 33 to 50 percent
Mr. Fraser’s estimate of front-line
troops.)
Bluntness in foreshadowing bad news
rather than waiting for possible protests
was a typical action by Fraser, who
knows what the risks are to men in
Vietnam, and also to anyone who tries
to hedge about them
The initial reaction to Fraser’s frank
revelation caused some consternation in
Government circles. There were doubts
that he should have pub licised that most
National Servicemen were destined for
combat roles> but there was also dismay
he should envisage batdes in which
AT . , c . ° ~ . ,
National Servicemen could outnumber
. r . , ...
the professional soldier,
But Mr. Fraser, answering a question
from Deputy Opposition Leader Lance
Barnard on Thursday, repeated for the
benefit of all Members his previous
night’s statements to the Press. The
political pundits then decided it was
time to take a closer look at the Fraser
tactics,
The ex ercise has resulted in the belief
that while Malcolm Fraser on this occa-
sion appeared to be indiscreet he in fact

Archaeology
Greek dig
THE UNIVERSITIES’ money
squeeze does not appear to have af-
fected one of the most exotic of Aus-
tralia’s academic activities: Classical
Greek Archaeology. The University of
Sydney’s Archaeology Department has
received a grant of $35,000 from official
sources for an expedition which sets out
from Sydney next month for Andros, an
island not far from Athens.
The total cost of a number of seasons
of digging on Andros is expected to be
about $70,000 dollars, which will leave
about $35,000 to be collected by pri-
vate donation. The leader of the expedi-
tion, Professor Alexander Cambitoglou,
has launched the Association for Classi-
cal Archaeology, which will collect the
money. The Association had its
inaugural dinner at the Menzies Hotel
in Sydney last Thursday night, attended
by 150 such well-heeled culture-lovers
as Warwick Fairfax at $250 a plate.
Greece must have been dug over more
than any country in the world. The
material dug up cannot be removed
from Greece. The digging season comes
during the middle of the Australian
academic year. The distance from Syd-
ney to Greece makes it possible to take
only three students to gain practical
experience in digging which seems a
slight gain in comparison with the work
the University’s Anthropology Depart-
ment is doing with its digs in Australia.
In the circumstances, a grant of
$35,000, when other worthy projects are
crying vainly for money, seems odd.
Resorts
Norfolk Is. bars
PLACID LITTLE Norfolk Island is
currently debating an issue that would
have amused Fletcher Christian heartily
in his palmiest days - whether or not
the island’s tourist hotels should have
bars selling liquor.
They hadn’t, until the planners of a
new hotel asked for a licence, and the
Representative Council recommended
it to the Department of Territories.
That was enough. The new hotel’s
owners did not wait for official per-
mission, but opened the bar and started
selling, just before Christmas. Other
hotels followed.
And that was too much. A new
Council spoke of reversing the recom-
mendation. The island’s chamber of
commerce met to affirm its support
for the bars. The wheels of the island’s
democratic institutions are now grinding
toward a decision.

Building
Plastic kits
George Barker and his plastic home in suburban Perth
WHILE MIGRANT HOUSING was
the subject of charges and counter-
charges throughout Australia last week,
in the West a British migrant builder
was confidently setting out to mass-
produce a better, comparatively low-
cost house of plastic. And to 45-year-old
Mr. George Barker this would be the
understatement of 1967, for he main-
tains he holds the key to a building
revolution that will supersede present
construction techniques. Mr. Barker’s
idea is to have a series of light columns
instead of the few heavy columns.
For this he is using plastic plastic
in such a variety of permutations that
a computer is used for selection of the
right one. And the new building tech-
nique, he says, will also radically alter
design. “In Spain, for example, they
build to suit the climate, and I intend
dojng this here. There will be no open-
ing windows, simply louvres in the top
section. The material I am using has
been found to have the thermal insula-
tion equivalent of 7ft. Bin. of brickwork,
so it will certainly be cool enough for
the Australian climate.”
Mr. Barker left England because he
could not get Government backing for
his ideas. While he has received no
cash from the Western Australian Gov-
ernment, Mr. Charles Court’s Depart-
ment of Industrial Development
(“There is no equivalent body in Eng-
land”) has shepherded him through the
birth throes of his new venture.
He is setting up a 17-acre factory
leased from the Government on a nom-
inal rental in Bunbury, and plans to
start operating in two months, with the
first home off the line a few weeks after
that. He hopes eventually to employ
up to 200 in the plant . . . most of
them, remarkably, girls. A “very con-
servative” estimate of the cost for a
10-square house: $BOOO.
The Barkers’ Perth suburban home is
in plastic and has created a great deal
of interest. “The first home off the line
will be for the Government,” Mr. Barker
says. “They want the prototype to try
in a number of different situations. And
there have been inquiries about us turn-
ing out houses for the Mt. Newman
project; that would entail houses for
two towns, more than 500 in all. The
Minister for Education has shown
interest for packaged schools, the Army
has asked about plastic pontoons with
the same material, and we will be pro-
ducing beach-side houses with do-it-
yourself kits.
Mr. Barker, who started patenting his
ideas as a 16-year-old, is a mechanical
engineer by profession. His last job as
an employee was in research into gas
turbines, and since then he has set up
Barker Houses Ltd. with his “matrix
materials,” which, he says, have won
approval of university and industrial
boffins, including top scientists from
ICI and Shell; “ICI said we were 20
years ahead of them.” In Australia he
is negotiating with Olympic Products
and the Nylex plastics group for a stake
in the new venture.
To Mr. Court, this is a man with
the type of initiative and courage the
State needs. “He has brought challeng-
ing ideas at a time when it is most
urgent not only to reduce housing costs
but to increase the availability of houses.
He has put a lot of thought into climatic
requirements, and from our point of
view has the added advantage of want-
ing to set up in the country. We wel-
come men like this, willing to give it a
go, men of enthusiasm whose ideas are
capable of generating new thought in
the community.”


Man on the Land
Brokers plan new look for
wool marketing
THE 4000-WORD document on wool
marketing issued by the National Coun-
cil of Wool Selling Brokers is un-
questionably the most important de-
velopment in wool politics since the
1965 reserve-price referendum.
The brokers are proposing that a
wool-marketing organisation be set up
to administer the selling system. This
organisation would consist of 12 direc-
tors (six growers, three brokers, and
three buyers) under a grower chairman.
The organisation can come into exist-
ence only if growers, through the Wool
Industry Conference, endorse it. This
may or ,may not happen, but one can
hardly imagine that the brokers would
have made this suggestion without first
sounding-out the likely reaction.
There is a concession on the part of
the brokers in this proposal. As stated
by the council chairman, Mr. A. S.
Dunstan, it gives growers “for the first
time in 124 years of wool auctions the
opportunity of participating in the man-
agement of the system.” In the past,
wool-selling regulations have been
framed by brokers and buyers with the
brokers acting on behalf of growers,
who have not always been entirely ap-
preciative of what has been done on
their behalf.
From the Australian taxpayers’ point
of view, this proposal, if it comes to
fruition, could end the squabbling which
has lowered the prestige of the wool
industry in recent years. Prestige is
all very well, but, more important, this
proposal does not ask the taxpayer to
dip into his pocket.
If growers give the go-ahead, then it
could be said that the wool industry
has, at long last, begun to put its own
house in order. The timing, from the
grower-approval angle, is good. The
reverses suffered in New Zealand have
caused many former reserve-price sup-
porters to doubt the wisdom of planned
wool marketing. Wool Board chairman
Sir William Gunn is in deep trouble
with a number of grower organisations
(formerly his allies) over the promo-
tion-funds issue. These organisations are
not opposed to the idea of wool promo-
tion but are opposed, very strongly, to
promotion without reserve price or,
alternatively, planned marketing.
The alternative, which has created
most discussion and which possibly
prompted the brokers’ move, has been
the Killen acquisition-cum-pool system
which has been taken, in some quarters,
as a blueprint of Wool Board and In-
ternational Wool Secretariat ambition.
Into this cauldron of conflicting and
seemingly unrelated issues, views, in-
sinuations, falling wool prices, in-
creased promotion expenditure, wasted
research moneys and suspect theories,
the National Council of Wool Selling
Brokers has pitched a positive, and
feasible, plan for free-enterprise mar-
keting of wool. Not all woolgrowers
will welcome it, some will certainly
oppose it. Yet the chances of accept-
ance are by no means as dim as some
of the planned marketing enthusiasts
would have us believe.
Whether or not the brokers’ proposal
meets with growers’ approval the fact
remains that it is a firm statement of
opinion. This has been sorely needed.
It was missing, remember, in the reserve
price referendum and was commented
Woolbrokers’ A. S. Dunstan
upon by numerous growers who actu-
ally sought a lead from their brokers.
The 22 firms belonging to the
National Council of Wool Selling Brok-
ers have now committed themselves to
the free enterprise system, to outright
rejection of any acquisition plan, and
to a doubtful attitude toward any re-
serve price plan. The council does not
seek mandatory controls over private
buying. It hopes that its proposal will
be so attractive that growers will volun-
tarily support auctions rather than sell-
ing privately.
This, to all grower organisations, is
likely to make strong appeal even if
other parts of the proposal do not. All
organisations, officially, are opposed to
private buying, but they know full well
that many of their members indulge
in it. In fact, it goes deeper than this
generalisation. Many smaller growers,
who are supposed to be the strongest
supporters of planned marketing, are
private sellers of wool.
Taking a very broad view, the reac-
tion to the brokers’ plan might go this
way. The Woolgrowers and Graziers’
Council, and the State Graziers’ Associa-
tions, could give approval. The section
of the N.S.W. Graziers’ which has been
dabbling with the Killen plan could
take the attitude that this is worth a
try. The Wool and Meat Producers’
Federation could offer resistance and
yet, because of antagonism with the
Board over promotion funds, this resis-
tance might be lessened if, in some
manner, conditions relating to promo-
tion funds were forthcoming.
Promotion funds are not part of the
brokers’ proposal, but consider the pos-
sibilities if the Wool Industry Con-
ference takes the view that the six
grower directors of the proposed
marketing organisation should be one
and the same as six grower delegates
on the Wool Board. This could happen.
In the past there has been a suggestion,
strongly supported by some growers,
that the executive of the Wool Industry
Conference and the Wool Board should
be one and the same. But could the
chairman of the Wool Board and the
chairman of the proposed marketing
organisation be one and the same?
Interesting question, with interesting
possibilities!
The brokers’ proposal gives growers
a chance to participate in wool market-
ing programming and the fixing of
regulations which the Wool Board
cannot offer.
The proposal extends, obviously, to
reserve price supporters as, almost cer-
tainly, the composition of the AWIC
would mean that three directors would
come from one side (roughly speak-
ing anti-reserve price) and three from
the other (roughly speaking pro-
reserve price). Some of the reserve
price men are astute enough to take
the view that if this is not what they
really want, it is nevertheless a good
opening.
We can take it for granted that this
brokers’ plan suits the brokers or it
would not have come into being (al-
though some of them doubtless took
some persuading). The same goes for
buyers. It should suit the Federal Gov-
ernment and it should suit the Austra-
lian public. The manufacturing trade
seems unlikely to offer opposition.
The growers, as far as we can see, are
placed in a position where, if they do
not “give it a go,” they are out of step
with everyone else.
The proposals go far beyond the
setting up of the marketing organisa-
tion, although clearly such an organisa-
tion is necessary in order that the plan
can function.
Important suggestions in the plan
are: —a marketable parcel of wool would
be four bales or more; one, two, or three
bale lots received for sale would be

Visions of beef
in the north
WE ARE HEADING fast toward
becoming a cow culture. Our children
will see beef replace wool as Aus-
tralia’s most important agricultural
industry. Within 50 years the northern
half of the continent w'ill have an
export income matching that of the
south. It will also be providing a liveli-
hood for as many people. By that time
cattle numbers in the north will have
mounted to 60 million, w'hile in the
south a ceiling around 25 million wall
have been reached.
This is the destiny foreseen for us
by Dr. E. M. Hutton. His immediate
and knowledgeable audience, consisting
of members of the Australian Institute
of Agricultural Science who had
gathered in Melbourne to listen to his
presidential address, did not appear to
doubt these prophetic utterances. Dr.
Hutton is characterised in the profes-
sion as a soundly cautious scientist: if
he says something then it must be so.
His professional career now stretches
over almost 35 years. The first half of
his experience w ? as w ; on in the south of
the continent and the second half has
been gleaned w'hile he has been
stationed in Queensland. He is the
Assistant-Chief of the CSIRO Division
of Tropical Pastures. His most out-
standing contribution to agriculture has
been the breeding of the world’s first
man-made tropical legume, Sirato. He
bred it from two varieties of Phaseolus
atropurpureus, which is a perennial
relative of the phasey bean. The parent
varieties came originally from Mexico,
but Sirato is considerably more produc-
tive than either of them. It is especially
suited to pastoral conditions in tropical
and sub-tropical Queensland, but also
does w'ell elsewhere in northern Aus-
tralia and promises to raise the standard
of living in various parts of the tropical
world.
Dr. Hutton documented his prog-
nostications wfith plenty of data which
any Doubting Thomas will be able to
consult in due course w'hen the full
text of his address is published in the
June issue of the Institute’s quarterly
journal. Suffice to mention here only a
few' of his figures. Roughly two-thirds
of the total area of Australia which
lends itself to pasture improvement
lies in the north. Some 430 million
acres of Australia are capable of inten-
sive agricultural or pastoral develop-
ment. Only 150 million of these are in
southern Australia, with a rainfall of
15 inches or more, but the remaining
280 million acres are in the north,
where they receive not less than 20
inches. Of this improvable land 43
percent has already been developed in
the south, but only 2\ perc.ent in the
north.
Such facts led Dr. Hutton to pro-
nounce that “in spite of the acknow-
ledged value of its mining industries,
the greatest long-term asset in the north
is its vast areas of undeveloped land,
which research is now showing is
capable of much higher production.
Thus beef will take its place with
minerals as a potent force in northern
development and also in Australia’s
overall prosperity.” (He sees beef and
veal exports increasing sixfold.) For
emphasis he added, “The chain reaction
started by minerals and beef in the
north will ultimately prove to be vital
Loading Queensland cattle
to Australia’s prosperity, stability, and
future security in spite of unrealistic
predictions to the contrary.”
Curiously, in Dr. Hutton’s view, the
old money barons in the south have
generally failed to notice the invest-,
ment opportunities beckoning in the
north. As long as the southern financiers
remain unmindful of their patriotic
and pleasantly profitable obligations in
our nether lands, Dr. Hutton welcomes
the increasing infusion of American
dollars. This astute Yankee money is
putting northern development at least
ten years ahead, he believes.
Stranger still to Hutton’s mind is the
fact that only 20 percent of our 2560
agricultural scientists are at present
living and working in the north, where
the challenges are greater and the
chances of winning fame correspond-
ingly better.

"If Australia is now a part of Asia how are those
two Asians going to get back into Australia?"
COMMENT
Should we play favorites in Asia?
NOW THAT MR. HOLT has returned
from his tour of Cambodia, Laos,
Taiwan, and Korea, the Deputy Prime
Minister of Malaysia arrives on a 10-
day tour of Australia. As well as thank-
ing us in public for our military and
economic assistance, Tun Abdul Razak
will no doubt also discuss in private
what the future relations of our two
countries are to be. These have been
for so long the relations of crisis that
it is useful for Tun Razak to be in Aus-
tralia at a time when affairs are quiet
in the Malay Archipelago.
Given peaceful relations between the
four nations that make up this appen-
dage of the Asian land mass
Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the
Philippines it is important that Aus-
tralia should not play favorites between
them, at least so far as economic assist-
ance is concerned. Despite the tragic-
ally pressing needs of the fndo-
nesians for some kind of prop while
the new Government in Djakarta begins
o clean up Sukarno s mess, it a so
yms.mportanl that th.s urgcn ne.d
should not interfere with the assistance
we provide to other nations in the area.
Malaysia, for instance, is earning its
prosperity by good internal manage-
ment and deserves further support.
There would be a temptation to play
favorites with the nations of the Malay
Archipelago as a whole, as contrasted
with the rest of South-East Asia, but
we cannot afford this way out. Political
interest and other reasons demand that
we show our friendship to the strange
mixture of styles in Government that
are represented in Thailand, Cambodia,
Laos, and South Vietnam. By the time
we take a special interest in providing
economic assistance to eight nations the
phrase loses its meaning. Between them
they make up all South-East Asia, apart
from Burma, whose present policy is
that it doesn’t want anybody’s interest.
would seem more than ever neces-
sary that we should increase our total
a.id. appropriation so that we have a
hit more to go around. But merely
increasing appropriations is not good
enough, as our expenditure on the
armed forces shows. After the long years
Q f ne glect this has gone up by a
dramatic proportion, but who would
suggest that we know what we are
doing? No general policy informs our
on , he armed ( „ rcfs

A S eneral P oll <T on aid mi S ht lnclude
a statement on an area of special
interest. (South-East Asia seems a big
enough area.) The approach that Mr.
Hasluck suggested in Djakarta in
January of paying special
to training programs seems a good
one. What seems very important is that
we should take any sense of patronage
out of it. There are some kinds of aid
that can benefit us as well as the nation
we are dealing with. A clear example is
when some of the aid money is actually
spent in Australia. Another and even
more important example would be a
policy which dropped tariffs on certain
goods from a defined area. We could
then buy these things more cheaply
and, to the extent that we were no
longer manufacturing them ourselves,
direct effort to economic activities that
make more sense within Australia.
In these matters the shape of possible
policies may soon be clearer. If the
Japanese secure our assistance in build-
ing up some kind of Asia-Pacific
economic arrangement, this will give us
something to work within. If some of
the nations of South-East Asia form
economic groupings, this will give us
larger units to deal with. And if Britain
enters the Common Market and we
have the problem of New Zealand to
help dispose of, along with quite con-
siderable problems of our own, we may
get the kind of shock that breaks up
old policy habits and creates new ones.


THE B.H.P Australai's 7th State
Sir Colin Syme
IN THE 19305, at a time when people
were seriously wondering if capitalism
might not be collapsing, one of the fav-
orite blame-it-alls in Australia was the
BHP, believed to be at the centre of a
national conspiracy which was summed
up in the student song “There’ll always
be a Menzies while there’s a BHP.”
Suspicion of this Australian monopoly
belonged to the last years of the car-
toonist’s conception of the capitalist as
“Fat Man” a top-hatted, coarse-
faced, big-gutted monster, every tooth
in his head gleaming with ill-gotten
gold.
Now that the vogue fear figure is
not the top-hatted millionaire but the
heavily bespectacled American Organis-
ation Man, thin, steely-eyed, every inch
of his stomach lining ulcerated with
anxiety, the BHP gets by much more
easily in the public mind as the most
convincing single example of native
Australian industrial enterprise. It is
fitting that some of its biggest problems
are now organisational. As hundreds of
ironworkers’ cars glistened outside in
the sunshine at the BHP’s Newcastle
steelworks, a BHP executive said:
“We’ve still got a PR problem. But
it’s not the public we are so much con-
cerned about now. Nor the workers.
It’s the image of our company held by
our own executives, scientists, and tech-
nologists. Many of them feel that they
belong to something that is too big for
them to understand and that is too big
to understand them.”
Of the BHP’s bigness there is no
doubt. Outside American companies, in
profit terms it is the second biggest
steel cojnpany in the world. It is one of
the world’s biggest companies of any
kind. Its turnover, estimated at some-
thing like $B5O million, is bigger than
the Budgets of any of the States, in-
cluding New South Wales. At about
$l5O million, the BHP spends more on
salaries and wages alone than the whole
Tasmanian Budget. If you add capital
expenditure, the BHP spends twice as
much as the Tasmanian Government. It
is as if Australia had a seventh State,
and its name was the Broken Hill Pro-
prietary Company.
BHP still sells the world’s cheapest
steels. During the past 15 years its out-
put of steel has almost quadrupled. Its
rate of expansion has been almost twice
the world average, beating all the others
except Japan. Its pervasive influence on
the economy one way or the other
affects the prosperity of all of us. Or
as its managing director, Sir lan Mc-
Lennan, puts it in a masterpiece of
BHP understatement: “The impetus
given by the rapid expansion of output
has been an important factor in the
progress of the Australian economy.”
Its plants and quarries ring Australia
(see map). Spread around the contin-
ent (and New Guinea) at 26 different
places, they provide a giant complex of
extraction of natural resources and the
use of them in heavy industry. This
spread across the continent is no whim.
The BHP is driven by a hunger to make
steel and it is this basic drive that
pushes it into new fields. The things
the BHP needs to make steel out of
come from all round Australia dolo-
mite, limestone, and iron ore in South
Australia, iron ore in Western Australia,
coal, limestone, and magnesite in New
"The B.H.P. spends twice as
much as the Tasmanian
Government."
South Wales, manganese in Groote
Eylandt, and the BHP ransacks Austra-
lia looking for them.
Even the new venture into oil and
gas in Bass Strait was connected with
the BHP’s basic strategy of controlling
the supply of its own raw materials.
Steelmaking takes large amounts of
energy, and natural gas could be a use-
ful source. There is certainly more
about its venture into this field than one
of its Board member’s recent remarks
that “BHP ca,me to oil and gas explora-
tion because we thought it was time
it was done efficiently.” What has hap-
pened with the BHP is that from being
a steel company that happened to mine
many of its raw materials it is becoming
a huge mining company in its own right.
Much of its creative energy is now
directed to exploration. In fact, this
year the BHP set up an explorations
directorate.
The BHP set out on this sort of
course years ago. To talk of a “new”
BHP misses the point that when Essing-
ton Lewis stepped down from the
Board’s chairmanship more than a dec-
ade ago the new men began to have a
new look at development (and market-
ing). Their decision to spend $250,000
in preliminary testing of Louis Week’s
decision that the Bass Strait was the
place to drill for oil and gas was
simply part of that development. With
the BHP, policy follows technical re-
quirements. Many of the decisions
that look so much like major policy
moves seem instead to have emerged
out of the group’s technical require-
ments. They need something. So they
go and look for it. For example, the
nickel finds near Rockhampton made
last year followed a lengthy research
program aimed at showing the most
likely environments where nickel would
be found. This same sort of approach
applied to manganese and also to gas.
In the same way, the BHP’s .massive-
ness as a steel producer pushes it into
other manufacturing. Its manufacture
of tungsten carbide and cement and its
associated companies’ activities in air-
craft, chemicals, files, cutlery, pyrites,
small tools, pipes, tubes, and drums are
all associated in some way with its steel-
making. And its very size pushes it into
political decisions. Cheap power was
only one reason why the BHP set up a
manganese smelter in Tasmania: an-
other reason was that the company was
not really represented there. As it
stands now, the manganese ore comes
from the top of Australia at Groote
Eylandt, right round to Tasmania and
then up to Newcastle and Port Kembla
after processing.
Nevertheless, if a proposition doesn’t
seqm to make sense the BHP will re-
ject political endearments. It has re-
jected the Tasmanian Government’s
attempts to get it to start up a steel
industry in Tasmania and it took its
own time in reacting to Western Aus-
tralian pressure to set up a steelworks
at Kwinana.
Its size and complexity necessarily
make the BHP a political animal, but
net in the sense that the chairman of
the BHP and the Prime Minister of
Australia plot together over their glasses
of port in the Melbourne Club. Most
of the problems of the BHP are too
technical and detailed for its chairman
and the Prime Minister to know about,
or perhaps even to understand. As a
kind of Department of State in its own
right the BHP’s contacts with Govern-
ment departments are “at the appro-
priate level,” and not always one way.
Sometimes Government officials must
turn to BHP officials for information,
not least when they are making
economic plans. A Government that did

would find it hard to plan for Australia.
For instance, Treasury officials need to
know what the BHP is thinking of put-
ting into forthcoming Government
loans and what its future capital ex-
penditure is likely to be; Trade officials
want to know about steel exports, the
BHP’s imports bill and import replace-
ment plans. And one way for Govern-
ment officials to manipulate the econ-
omy is to try to give the BHP a bit of a
push in the light direction. It was
interesting to note that last year, when
the rate of increase in private fixed
investment slackened, the BHP pushed
up its own capital expenditure to the
biggest in its history.
It is part of the BHP style that Sir
Colin Syme, the BHP’s chairman, drives
his own not-so-new Holden car, has
more old suits than new in his ward-
robe, keeps his papers in a tatty brief-
case, and wears a raincoat that has seen
better days. There is no anxious pres-
tige-building about the BHP Board. If
anything it tends toward an English
emphasis on amateurism. Whereas the
Board of an American steel company
would bristle with company men, the
Board of the BHP is made up mainly
of outsiders. A lawyer by profession,
Syme himself only recently decided to
devote his whole working time to the
BHP.
One of the reasons for internal dis-
content among the company’s executives
and specialists is this feeling that, at the
top, they are not adequately repre-
sented. The situation of the Board in
Melbourne adds to this sense of remote-
ness. Although the Bass Strait oil and
gas exploration now brings something
of importance close to the Board, it is
ironic that, to the BHP, Victoria is one
of the least important States. In the
days of the company’s foundation as a
mining company at Broken Hill, Mel-
bourne was the centre of the Austra-
lian .mining boom. But this no longer
has any meaning. Some executives in
the field are afraid that part-time direc-
tors living in Melbourne lose all “feel”
for the company, that if the boardroom
was moved to one of the major plants


this could lead to a cross-fertilisation of
attitude that would benefit the
company.
It has been one of the curiosities
of the BHP that, while in its general
management it is very much “an en-
gineers firm” some of its critics
would say too much so at the top,
in its Melbourne fortress, it has dis-
played an untypical remoteness from
the problems of the field. Down the
line - straight under the boardroom
level it has as many engineers in key
positions as Qantas has ex-captains for
executives. In fact its financial affairs
have usually had to fit in with the way
the engineers wanted to run things.
This may explain why the company
keeps up its uneconomic method of fin-
ancing its development by having lots of
money lying around in low-yielding
Commonwealth bonds. It raises money
well in advance of its needs and then
buys bonds with it, as much as $75 mil-
lion worth.
The management structure is now
convulsing with change. Last year a
New York management consultant
group was hired to diagnose the symp-
toms. The big change on top was the
decision to make the chairman, Sir
Colin Syme, a full-time executive and
to bring up Sir lan McLennan from
general manager to managing director,
Sir Colin chairing the finance com-
mittee, Sir lan chairing the executive
committee. This two-men-at-the-top
idea, one a bit ahead of the other but
having different responsibilities, has
been developed in America recently
“for balance.” The General Motors
management is the biggest example of
it.
Working with each of the two top
men will be a special assistant. For Sir
Colin Syme, J. F. Rich, a 47-year-old
accountant who will also be general
manager, a BHP man since the days
when he left Newcastle High School;
and for Sir lan McLennan (himself an
engineer) another engineer in J. C.
Richards, 55, who has been general
manager of development and shipbuild-
ing since 1959. In the McLennan appar-
atus, instead of the bottleneck of one
general manager who had to issue orders
all over the place, eight heads of par-
ticular activities will filter things out
before they knock on Sir lan’s door.
Two of them seem to be more equal
than the other six. J. D. Norgard, an
engineer who has spent his working life
with BHP, has the general supervision
of the group’s steel and probably, later,
shipbuilding and engineering operations.
J. C. McNeill, an accountant, will super-
vise finance. Along with Rich it is ex-
pected that he will develop a more effi-
cient and coherent budgeting and fin-
ancial pattern which will go beyond the
present eccentricity of raising $75 mil-
lion in debentures costing 7 percent in
interest, which is then held in Common-
wealth Bonds earning something like 4
percent.
Along with these changes is accept-
ance of the idea of “profit centres.” In
an organisation like the BHP, which is
a meritocracy with share ownership
irrelevant to preferment and with no
line of succession in the management,
one of the problems is to instil a spirit
of, competition between the managers,
or even to know what is happening.
Under the new idea the BHP’s activities
are now grouped into “profit centres,”
each of which is considered as if it were
a separate company, irrespective of
whether the BHP or one of its subsidi-
aries owns it, so that the subsidiary
structure becomes more of an account-
ant’s fiction than a function of manage-
ment. It is a way of working out. what
is really going on.
It is by such means that the BHP is
struggling free from its own history. For
many years its management structure
was just put together in bits and pieces,
as the situation seemed to demand, with-
out any coherent or predictable pattern.
No one in the present management has
gone through a thorough services staff
college to get a full appreciation of
what decentralisation is really about.
In 1959 there was an attempt to put to-
J . C. Richards, Executive Assis-
tant to the Managing Director
gether a chain of management by crea-
ting a series of general managers for
the various operational divisions, under
a chief general manager who was re-
sponsible to the managing director. But
the BHP being what it is, the principle
of decentralisation got rather lost. The
old-boy nod and the bush telegraph had
been around too long to be given away
at one stroke.
It is premature to start talking about
who will follow at the top. Rich has
youth on his side, but the BHP may be
looking to operations for its next mana-
ging director, and for a steel man at
that rather than somebody mainly
versed in administration or finance.
Here Richards may be a candidate, al-
though he is not on the recently set-up
executive committee of four, whereas
this committee does include J. D. Nor-
gard. The company seldom has need to
look beyond its own four walls for a
top man, though it recently did when
it brought in D. G. Maye, 47, from the
Snowy Mountains Authority - another
reservoir bursting with Australian bred
and trained engineering talent to
head its exploration division. The great-
est measure of the BHP’s Australianism
is it ownership. The company is about
90 percent owned by Australians and
New Zealanders. Its 130 million $2
shares (worth about $B3O million at
current prices) dominate the Australian
stock market so massively that when
their price falls, so does the share price
index. In 1961 many U.S. international
investors bought heavily into the BHP
at high prices, but they sold out four
or five years later when the company’s
performance did not satisfy them. In-
vestors wonder if the BHP put out
unimpressive reports to encourage the
Americans to sell! Since the Americans
sold out and shares hit their low of
$4.55, they have gone up again by more
than $2.
When the embattled Mr. Albert Shep-
herd (the company’s largest individual
shareholder) attacks the BHP for its
profit policy, the board replies that it is
concerned with the national interest as
well as shareholders’ dividends. Dis-
J. F. Rich, General Manager,
Administration, and Assistant to
the Chairman
contented shareholders point to BHP’s
assets of SB7O million at book value
(worth a lot more in real terms) and
suggest that the $24 million dividend
is not an adequate return. Says Sir lan
McLennan: “We have four sections of
the community to whom we are respon-
sible: shareholders, employees, custom-
ers, and the public in general.” To
this the discontented reply that the
company is not earning enough because
it is doing too many things. To this
the Board can reply that, of the world’s
major steel companies, the BHP shows-
one of the highest rates of profitability.
That the BHP is development-conscious
seems beyond dispute. Of last year’s
pre-tax profit of $133 million only $21.5
million went out to shareholders (and
$27 million in tax). The rest went back
to finance expansion and replacement
of plant.
When they expand, how far is the
Board concerned with Australia’s inter-
ests as well as the BHP’s? The question
cannot be answered. What’s good for
Australia is good for the BHP. When
the BHP came to the aid of the Mt.
Newman iron ore operation, giving it a


60 percent Australian ownership and an
Australian management, it aided Aus-
tralia, and also itself because the
BHP becomes its own customer at Mt.
Newman, and as the capital cost of de-
veloping it is amortised over the Jap-
anese export contract, BHP should be
getting so,me cheap iron ore. In the
same way with oil and gas the
BHP could do with some. So far as
dividend policy is concerned, while the
BHP’s policy is developmental, it is
also sensible self-interest for it not to
make a welter of profit-making. That
way could lie nationalisation.
Criticism of the modesty of its role
as an exporter of steel often ignores the
difficulties of the world steel market,
where prices fluctuate, usually down-
ward. In the past the BHP has always
aimed at meeting Australian demand.
In the Essington Lewis days and for
quite some time afterward there
were many critics of the company’s
methods of not quite keeping up with
demand, so that there was always a bit

General Manager, Operations
J. C. McNeill, Executive
General Manager, Finance

of a shortage and sometimes a serious
one. This did not assist Australia’s bal-
ance of payments and at times of serious
shortage it harmed them. Should the
BHP sacrifice its own stability in the
interests of Australia’s export earnings?
The answer lies in a special difficulty
of the steel industry: that it costs an
immense amount to add to capacity
(for example, the BHP spent $126 mil-
lion last year) and this bas to be done
in big units. So increases in capacity
cannot at once be matched by increases
in demand. While capacity goes up in
ju,mps, demand rises more gently, and
sometimes falls. The two extremes are
that a steel company can decide to
keep capacity ahead of demand or to
undersupply the market almost perm-
anently. If it keeps capacity ahead of
demand it tries to sell off extra pro-
duction on the world market at the best
price it can get. Lately this has not
been very much. If it undersupplies,
this has to be supplemented by millions
of dollars’ worth of imports.
The BHP seems to have taken a posi-
tion somewhere between these two ex-
tremes. There have been enough
periods of undersupply for the BHP not
to come out as a company concerned
entirely with the national interest; on
the other hand there have been times
when it has deliberately set out on an
expansion that it knew would be far
ahead of demand and on which it would
have to depend on exports for a large
proportion of its sales. Over the past
eight years BHP has exactly kept this
middle position; steel imports and steel
exports exactly balance out over the
past eight years, with five years of ex-
port surpluses totalling $B3 .million be-
ing exactly offset by three years of im-
port surpluses of the same amount. Steel
does not look like a net export earner
for Australia unless the BHP changes
its attitude. But while in a “bad” year
like 1965 we had to import $22 million
worth of steel, in a good year like 1966
BHP exported enough steel for Australia
to have net export earnings of $3l mil-
lion.
For the first time the BHP is now
facing competition in the iron ore busi-
ness, but despite all the big new de-
velopments in Western Australia the
BHP is still dominant. It takes 7 million
tons of its iron ore, mined mainly in
South Australia, and behind the reserves
at Iron Knob and Iron Baron there lie
large Western Australian deposits at
Yampi Sound, Cockatoo Island, Koolan
Island, Deepdale, and Koolyanobbing.
And the BHP owns a third of the stake
and is managing agent for the biggest
development in the West, at Mt. New-
man.
The BHP is also soon to face competi-
tion in the steel industry, the first com-
petition since it bought out a competi-
tor at Port Kembla in the 19305. Under
the terms of its agreement to mine and
export iron ore from Mt. Tom Price to
Japan, Hamersley Iron (a member of
the CRA-Kaiser group which also owns
Comalco Aluminium) is obliged to start
up a steel industry in Western Australia.
The BHP’s first counter-,move was to
try to buy into the Australian alu-
minium industry by tendering for the
bauxite deposits at Gove, in conjunction
with Reynolds Metals, of America. It
failed to Australia’s other giant
company of native origin, the CSR, in
conjunction with Swiss Aluminium. But
now that the CSR and the BHP are
partners in Mt. Newman, it is possible
that BHP could win a role at Gove.
Competition might also come from
Britain. Several of the major British
steel companies have large interests in
Australia which use steel but do not
make it here. When these companies
are nationalised they .may well look to
Australia as another place in which to
set up steel works to replace their Brit-
ish investments. For example, John
Lysaght is a subsidiary of the Guest
Keen and Nettlefold group of steel-
makers in Britain. Lysaghts are Austra-
lia’s main producer of strip and metal
steel sheet and the BHP’s biggest single
customer. Lysaght’s own requirements
are enough to justify a new steelmaking
plant. Competition also looms from
Tasmania. The Government there says
that an Australian company is investi-
gating whether a small specialised steel
industry could be started on the western
end of the Tasmanian north coast at
Port Latta, where Pickands Mather is
pelletising iron ore mined from the
Savage River, 50 miles inland, and ex-
porting it to Japan.
While the BHP is a .mammoth in size,
it is no mammoth biologically. It is
not likely to become extinct when faced
with competition. Embedded in the his-
tory of Australia and now, because of
its widespread operations, even in the
geography of Australia, the BHP is
very much a creature of its environ-
ment, skilled and adaptable, knowing
the lie of the land in the country it
has helped make prosperous.


MILLAND:
A backward glance
Ray Milland
“I WAS SITTING on my boat. This
book lay on a table in the saloon. I
read it, and I was horrified. Shocked
by the whole thing. My wife said, ‘Call
Buddy de Silva’ (he was head of Para-
mount). She said, ‘He says you’ve got to
play the lead in “The Lost Weekend”.’
And that was the shocking book I had
just finished. I thought, ‘He’s joking.’
I said, ‘l’ve no conception of how to
play a drunk. I don’t drink! I just can’t
play that part.’
“But I was on a studio contract. I
played it. And when I heard Charles
Brackett was going to produce and Billy
Wilder direct I didn’t back out. But I
had to find out what it meant to have
delirium tremens, to be in an alcoholic
ward. So I had the studio arrange for
me to check into the alcy ward at
Bellevue Hospital in New York. I had
to see what it was like, but at 3 a.m.
I couldn’t take any more. I ran out
of that place, right into the street, in
my pyjamas. A policeman took charge
of me and ordered me right back in
again.
“Then I did the exact same scene in
the film. Don Birnam, the central char-
acter in the book, also runs out of hos-
pital in the middle of the night, is taken
in charge by a cop, and returned in-
side. And the whole set of the hospital
was exactly like the real one, right down
to the last detail.”
It was, certainly, a part played to the
life; and it remains Ray Milland’s finest
achievement, one of the few screen
performances to justify its Oscar. As
Don Birnam—failed writer, desperate,
down on his luck, with overdone lit-
erary speeches to a barman, gazing at
the glittering liquor-rings of a city bar,
lurching along Third Avenue trying to
pawn his typewriter on a Jewish holiday
—Milland gave a frightening glimpse
into a private nightmare; he conveyed
the charm, the softness of the character
to perfection.
During his 21 years at Paramount,
as a contract star, he played everything:
bumping around in a studio tank with
Ethel Merman and Carole Lombard in
a madcap comedy, about stranded
desert islanders, “We’re Not Dressing,”
appearing in a sarong opposite Dorothy
Lamour in “Her Jungle Love,” riding
around the desert in a topez in “Beau
Geste,” grappling with an octopus in
“Reap the Wild Wind,” confronting a
writhing smoky ghost at the head of a
staircase in “The Uninvited,” braving
a seance presided over by an evil-eyed
Hillary Brooke in “Ministry of Fear,”
being thrown into debtors’ prison in
Mitchell Leisen’s splendid 18th century
story “Kitty,” dodging a lethal Charles
Laughton in “The Big Clock” and co-
starring with Ann Todd in “So Evil
My Love,” an actress of whom he suc-
cinctly said, “she had a whim of iron.”
Since then, as “X, the Man with the
By CHARLES HIGHAM
X-Ray Eyes,” he has had the worst
ordeal of all, seeing the bones beneath
the skin of otherwise enticing females.
In Sydney for the lead in “Hostile
Witness” (“It’s a wholesome play”) he
retains the suave and conservative
detachment that has enabled him to
breeze his way through his harrowing
assignments.
Conservative is, in fact, the word for
Milland: sober suited, with the well-fed
face of a successful stockbroker, his
voice as smooth as a silk’s, he exudes an
air of old-fashioned and agreeable re-
spectability that is a far cry from the
grunts and sweatshirts of today’s idols.
In the lushly upholstered Dietrich
suite at the Hotel Australia (they had
appeared together in “Golden Ear-
rings” “those earrings, how they
itched!”), Milland had forgotten a good
many of his pictures, but others evoked
some bizarre memories.
Pure “Hollywood” was Ginger
Rogers, Milland’s co-star in the famous
Kurt Weill musical “Lady in the Dark.”
“One morning we waited for hours.
Fabulous models, 200 extras, and me
. . . Ginger was late again. She was
always late. At last she came on the
set. It was 11 o’clock. And she still
hadn’t put on her make-up. The director
blew his stack and he could blow
it! She said, ‘All right, I’ll go and
make ,up.’ She left. 12 o’clock. No
Ginger. 12.30. Still no sign. They called
make-up. Not there. They called the
gate. Not there either. She’d just driven
away! And she didn’t come back for five
days ... . She just went off and got
married . . .”
On “The Uninvited,” the late Gail
Russell, then a budding star, later to
die tragically of drink, proved equally
hard to handle. “There was a scene
when I had to play piano, the theme
tune, ‘Stella By Starlight.’ I really had to
play, too, they couldn’t use a dummy
piano. Gail, who was the female lead
in the picture, had to look out of the
window as I played that tune and cry.
But she couldn’t cry. The director,
Lewis Allen, tried everything. She was
driving him nuts. Finally she said, ‘I
can only cry to Duke Ellington.’ So
he said, ‘Fetch a record.’ They put a
record of Duke Ellington on the set.
I was supposed to be there playing
this tune at the piano, ‘Stella By Star-
light,’ and they put on this darned
Duke Ellington record. It cut across
me. But she did cry and cry . . .”
On working with Hitchcock, with
whom he had made “Dial M for Mur-
der”: “He sits there like a Buddha
and never says a word. I remember in
that picture I had to play the longest
dialogue scene I’ve ever played 11
minutes of it in one take. I blew a line.
I ruined the take. I looked at Hitch-
cock. He said without a change of ex-
pression—Milland’s voice lapsed ex-
pertly into cockney—‘l wind it up, I
put it on the floor, and it doesn’t work
5 55
What about contemporary cinema?
“All those Italian films, horrible...
and ‘Fahrenheit 451’, directed by
Frankenheimer, no, Truffaut, terrible
. . . and theatre ... no wonder
Broadway’s doing so badly, Broadway
itself, that whole theatre area, it’s so
degenerate and bedraggled, people
won’t go, and they’re frightened to go
down there at night. Who’s going to
take his wife to such a neighborhood?
And pornographic films in the New
York movie houses. They found a girl
dead with her arms full of needle
marks, ripped right open up the front,
and she was the star of one of those
pictures . . .”
In his long career, encompassing an
entertainment era that had moved from
the cheerful extrovert crudity of early
Paramount musicals and comedies to
the age of sick theatre and pornog-
raphy on the public screen he hated,
had Milland taken much note of
critics? “Yes, except for critics like
Stanley Kauffman who write long
literary pieces working out all sorts of
meanings the director never intended.
What should a film critic be? He
should give first of all an analysis of
a picture’s entertainment value. Not
go into some kind of psychiatric
diatribe. Does the picture offend? Is it
compelling drama? That’s all.”
In those words, contemptuous of the
writings of critics like Pauline Kael
and Dwight Macdonald, of magazines
like “Sight and Sound” and “Film
Quarterly,” Ray Milland was the com-
plete professional.


How can a jet do a vertical take-off
without moving an inch?
A new wind tunnel has been designed and built by Hawker Siddeley Aviation
at Hatfield specifically for V/STOL research. The first in Europe, it has a
working section of 15' x 15'. The tunnel floor can be raised and lowered inde-
pendently of the model, and air-speed through the tunnel varied to simulate
different aspects of vertical and short take-off and landing.
Hawker Siddeley know how.
The jet aircraft is an accurate scale model. The vertical
take-off is simulated in Europe’s first V/STOL wind
tunnel, designed by Hawker Siddeley Aviation. Instead
of the model moving, the tunnel floor moves. And
research into V/STOL development progresses.
Hawker Siddeley have the world’s first operational
V/STOL jet to their name —the P. 1127. But the
Hawker Siddeley name means far more than this. It
represents a complex of companies that make Hawker
Siddeley a world-size industrial group.
You find Hawker Siddeley products almost every-
where. They go down on the farm —haul trains —steer
and power ships—probe space —build and equip
power stations —roll roads —store heat—fly people—
transform electricity—pack food —fuel aircraft. And
maintain a daily turnover of more than $A2f million.
Aircraft of the future are already part of this turnover,
but only part. That’s what makes Hawker Siddeley a
group. With group power.

JUNK
A LITTLE OLD LADY came into one
of the newest bric-a-brac shops in Wool-
lahra. She pottered around for some
time, gazing with some interest at a den-
tist’s chair, a wooden mangle, a moult-
ing feather fan, several luggage racks,
and a sign saying “Beware, Trains.” She
was looking, she said, for some little
thing to decorate her living-room. At
last her eyes lit up she had seen an
old-fashioned sign saying “French Corn
Cure Try It For Outstanding Re-
sults.” “I’ll have a packet of those,” she
said.
This marvellously quaint 1920 s sign
is now the talking point of someone’s
clever 1967 living-room, and so is the
story which goes with it. For the
trend-setters of Sydney, who follow the
scent of the latest “in” thing in decora-
tion with the keenness of bloodhounds,
have decided Victoriana is dead and
long live anything from Art Nouveau
(1895-1905) to the 19305. Tiffany
lamps, or, anything remotely like them,
are passionately sought after. Made by
noted American glass-worker Louis C.
Tiffany in the 1900 s, these lamps all
have a bronze base and shades of multi-
colored pieces of glass patchworked to-
gether with lead. They are spectacu-
larly inefficient at lighting up a room
and are very difficult to acquire in
Sydney, but are so hungered for that
paper facsimiles are being rustled up
and are selling rapidly.
Grant Roberts and Victoria and Don
Fish are three followers of the latest
fashion. They have been running a shop
called Kaleidoscope in Woollahra since
last September. They gather up a
collection of bric-a-brac and furniture,
send out invitations to an Opening, then
keep the shop open on Fridays and
Saturdays until everything is sold, or
until they get bored with the whole
thing. Then they shut up shop and start
collecting again.
For them the shop is a part-time
business. “We are anti-establishment,”
Mr. Fish, an advertising executive, said.
“We choose our things from the point
of view of design. We might be offered
seven old wooden mangles, for instance,
but only one would be marvellous, with
interesting fittings, nice wood, and a
good balance to it.”
Where would one put a wooden
mangle? “On the patio, in the living-
room, anywhere. This idea of beauty
in form itself, whether the article is a
dentist’s chair, an old wringer, or an
ancient sewing-machine, has some con-
nection with junk sculpture. Junk
sculptors use bits of machinery, nuts

and bolts, anything all welded to-
gether. When people see these sculp-
tures they become aware of the beauty
in ordinary things.”
Although there were no signs of a
beautifully formed mangle in the Fishs’
newly decorated Paddington terrace
house, there was rich evidence of Art
Nouveau and after. Tiffany lamps, of
course, a marble-topped table with cast-
iron sewing-machine base, 1920 s adver-
tising signs, a marble bust. In the
breakfast-room was an ornate French
country clock (1825) with a long pen-
dulum which no longer moved because
BY MARGO RATCLIFFE
a small child had recently swung on it.
The house shelters most of the con-
tents of the five-ton crate which the
Fishes brought back with them from
London two years ago. They got “hung
up” on Art Nouveau overseas.
The Fishs are always looking for
“something fresh.” Victoria, in particu-
lar, loves the beaded dresses of the
19205, and often wears them. They
think the frenzied stripping of furniture
which has been popular for the past
two years is “out.” Bright enamel is
“in.” Hand-painted chests-of-drawers
with flowers on them will be featured
in the next sale at Kaleidoscope.
Those who can’t find what they want
at Kaleidoscope -- little old ladies,
perhaps often get satisfaction at
Bizarre, another newish place in Wool-
lahra. Proprietor Noel Sweeney takes
in Victoriana, Art Nouveau, and any-
thing else he can acquire. He has old
photograph albums, inkwells, church
pews ($3O and snatched up for the
living-room), and a store dummy (a
boy’s head). He is meant to be smoking
a cheroot, but is making do with a filter-
tip. Mr. Sweeney stocks crystal, bronze,
copper, Chinese bric-a-brac. He aims
at keeping his prices below $4O and
thinks the market is “for anything dif-
ferent.”
In their search for individuality,
people buy old silver-framed photo-
graphs of other people’s dead relatives,
and florid, flowered chamber-pots, which
are used for ashtrays, soup-tureens, or
punchbowls.
More trend-setting goes on in Dry
Red, which is not a wine bar but a
furniture shop run by two nice English
girls Anya Copeland and Jackie Mac-
Donald, who couldn’t get the jobs they
were trained for when they arrived
from London last year. (They are dis-
play artists, but find it is a man’s world
here.) Their shop has been open for
three months, and they have their den-
tist’s chair upholstered in purple for
$95. The most expensive item in the
shop is a Chesterfield sofa, splendidly
covered in a William Morris type fabric,
for $136, and they have sold their
chamber-pot ashtray for $lO (it was
a vintage Doulton).
Enamelled furniture, Art Nouveau,
and the jazz age will have to satisfy
the hungry homemakers for a while.
Eighteenth- and nineteenth - century
antiques as well as being unexciting
to advanced taste are ever diminish-
ing in quantity and ever escalating in
price. \
Fifty years from now, what will be
treasured as bygones? The only unbroken
plastic toy jetgun left from the 19605?
A pseudo-Danish sideboard with pointed
metal legs, neatly finished with black
plastic caps? Or a lovely bunch of
plastic flowers?

This one
Modern Motor Readers' Poll, 1967
Winner BEST ALL-ROUNDER category
ROVER 2000
surprised even us!
Know why?
In the ‘Best Luxury Compact’ section of Modern Motor’s
readers’ poll, we had some fairly healthy competition:
Cars like the □ Daimler 2.5 □ Jaguar 3.8 S and
□ Lancia Flaminia, plus the □ Chrysler Regal □ Fiat
2300 □ Falcon Fairmont □ Holden Premier □ Nissan
Cedric De Luxe and the □ Triumph 2000. Still, we
weren’t too surprised to win this one. It was winning the
“Best All-rounder” category that really tickled us. For
this was the question asked: “Which current model,
regardless of cost, would you choose as the best all-round
car?” You know, we really expected people to go for the
Rolls. We really did. Or perhaps, since the Bond epics,
the Aston Martin DB6. But no, our Rover 2000 took it
out comfortably. Seems that the average Australian
motorist agrees with the' motoring authorities and writers
around the world who have heaped laurels on the Rover
2000 to the point of making us blush. Of course, this was
Rover’s avowed intention when they created the 2000
to make it the ultimate “all-round” car. Not just a mag-
nificently-appointed luxury car. Not just a rip-roaring
sports car. Not just a long-loping, mile-eating G.T. car.
Not just the world’s safest car. Not any single one of these
but all of them. If you’ve never before driven four cars
simultaneously, you’ve a treat in store. How about today?


Harold Holt continues
his education
By ALAN REID
who accompanied the Prime Minister on his recent Asian tour
CAMBODIA’S ANGKOR once had a
population of 12,000,000 people. War
and pestilence, but particularly war,
hit it. The jungle swallowed the city,
abandoned in 1432, as inexorably as a
boa-constrictor absorbing a rabbit. It
remained hidden from the view of the
world until a hundred years ago French
naturalist Henri Mouhot, turning a
corner of a jungle path, glimpsed the
mysterious loftiness of a tower above
the otherwise unbroken sea of foliage.
Mouhot and the archeologists who fol-
lowed his footsteps revealed to the
world the ruins of the most populous
city into which man is known to have
crowded. Unknowingly, they were also
to contribute to the education of an
Australian Prime Minister.
When Harold Holt stood in one of
the vast ruins of Angkor he looked
about as typical a representative of
modern Western civilisation as you
could find. Despite the oppressive heat
radiated from the age-old stones, his
whitening grey hair was smooth. He
was wearing an Hawaiian-type shirt,
smoothly laundered slacks, and sun-
glasses. He looked like any one of the
hundreds of the tourists who have
gazed, overwhelmed, at the impressive
majesty of the ruins. But for once
his rather toothy smile had disap-
peared. He was thoughtful, very
thoughtful, as well he might be. The
Australian Prime Minister was getting
an education and an insight into some
of the motivations of the people who
are our neighbors in South-East Asia.
He was also getting some guidance
to the thinking of Prince Norodam
Sihanouk, the controversial ex-king
who abdicated to become head of
State, politician, digger of ditches,
composer of music, director of films,
a many-sided man with the talents of
a Renaissance prince.
My impression is that several of the
things that were baffling Holt about
Sihanouk started to make sense after
that Angkor visit. It was not without
significance that later, back at the
modern, air-conditioned tourist hotel
(characteristically built under Sihan-
ouk’s careful personal supervision) Holt
said thoughtfully, “It does not matter
how good the reports are that you get
from your ambassadors and officials.
Not until you actually visit the country
upon which they are reporting can you
fit the reports into a proper context.”
Though he visited Cambodia, Laos,
Taiwan, and South Korea, I should
imagine Holt found the Cambodian
part of the trip the most fascinating,
and certainly the most demanding in
the political sense. Holt had to walk
a very careful tightrope. He was be-
tween the devil of American disapproval
of Cambodia and the deep blue sea of
his own conviction that Sihanouk was
acting in what Sihanouk considered to
be the best interests of. his people in
maintaining non-alignment. Even before
he went to Cambodia Holt was pre-
disposed toward Sihanouk. A pragma-
tist himself, Holt always has sympathy
for a fellow pragmatist.
Holt could understand the plight of
a country of only 6,250,000 people, with
indefensible frontiers, situated on the
edge of a war zone that might any
day extend into its territories. But
what Holt did not want to do was to
embarrass the United States, whose
broad policies in the area he supports.
Nor could he understand fully why
Sihanouk’s hunger for peace should be
accompanied by a strident anti-
Americanism and the placing of the
blame for Vietnam almost exclusively
upon American shoulders..
But from his conversation with
Sihanouk he learned that Sihanouk was
concerned with two things—military in-
roads and cultural inroads. On the
military side, Sihanouk was concerned
about getting involved in a war, in
which, whoever else might win, Cam-
bodia would lose. Holt does not believe
that Sihanouk wants to side with China
nor with anyone. He wants to keep
his indefensible country free from war
so that he can proceed with its develop-
ment. If the North Vietnamese should
chance to win and the Americans with-
draw, Sihanouk has no place to go. He
has to stay where he is geographically
located, and in the absence of the
Americans it is inevitable that China
would become the dominating power
of the area. It is as an insurance policy
against this that some of Sihanouk’s
anti-Americanism operates.
But this is only part of the picture.
Sihanouk is also a fervent nationalist.
Heir to a proud history Cambodia is
the oldest State in South-East Asia
Sihanouk is clearly determined to main-
tain the Cambodian culture as some-
thing precious and worth while. He has
fostered the old customs, the old dances,
and the old ways, but within a context
of modernity. Some of the architecture
in the Cambodian capital of Phnom
Penh is as exciting as any you would
see anywhere, combining the traditional
forms with utilitarian concrete, often
left rawly uncovered, as in Sihanouk’s
own palace, to blend with rich marbles
in quite startling beauty.
China as yet does not represent so
much of a cultural threat as America
does. But Sihanouk clearly does not
want a pop-and-automobile culture
wiping out the traditions which he
clearly believes should be preserved in
Cambodia even while it is making tech-
nological advances to gear it to the
modern world. Though much more
materialistic than Sihanouk, less
frightened than Sihanouk of American
culture, because he believes that it
brings benefits even while sometimes
extinguishing local cultures, Holt could
appreciate the nationalist basis of
Sihanouk’s anti-Americanism. But it
was probably not until he visited Angkor
that Holt realised the justification that
Sihanouk believes he has for the pre-
servation of the Cambodian way of life.
Holt appeared to get along extra-
ordinarily well with Sihanouk. There
was probably more than a bit of poli-
tics on both sides. It suits Sihanouk
to have a Western friend in addition
to de Gaulle. When he is charged, as
he often is, with reserving his cordi-
ality for those who are determinedly
anti-American, he can always point to
Australia. Similarly it suits Australia to
demonstrate to Asia that, while we
may go “all the way with LBJ” on
broad policy in South-East Asia, Aus-
tralia is capable of taking an indepen-
dent line on such an important issue
as friendship with the non-aligned
countries. Holt made no bones of his
belief that while the Americans might
think that Cambodia’s non-alignment


operates in favor of China, Australia
disagrees. In Holt’s view, it is an advan-
tage to have Cambodia non-aligned, to
limit the area of war. And it is of
value to the West to have a friendly
bridge, Australia, across which Cam-
bodia and the United States can later
cross to greater friendliness.
But as well as the politics, I think
genuine liking entered into the meet-
ing of the two men: Sihanouk, a bril-
lian improviser, devoted to the prag-
matic, and Holt, similarly pragmatic
but prosaic compared with Sihanouk,
an administrator rather than an impro-
viser, controlling a long-established
bureaucracy when Sihanouk has had to
rely upon personal exertion and
example.
The contrast between Cambodia’s
Phnom Penh and Laos’ Vientiane may
have influenced Holt’s judgment of
Sihanouk. However irritating Cam-
bodia’s policy may have been to the
In Laos
Western world, Cambodia has kept
itself free of actual war. This has per-
mitted it to concentrate upon develop-
ment, which appears to be significant,
steady, and mounting. Through no
fault of its own, in Laos, one man in
ten is in the Army, yet even so
(according to the Cambodian Chief of
Staff) a larger number of North Viet-
namese are on Laos territory than
there are Laotians in the Laotian
armies. As a consequence, Laos, which
once used to export rice, now imports
it. Admittedly it has been hit recently
by floods—Vientiane was almost com-
pletely under water but even if that
is allowed for, what comes through is
a sad picture.
Prime Minister Prince Souvanna
Phouma gives the impression of a
strong man trapped by circumstances.
He was quite gloomy when he spoke
to Australian pressmen. He could see
no way out of his country’s difficulties
until there was a settlement in Viet-
nam, and he could see no immediate
prospects for that. He was cautious
about commenting in public upon the
role that China was playing in South-
East Asia’s troubled affairs, but in pri-
vate he was forthcoming with Holt and
was not nearly so reticent about the role
China was playing.
Holt undoubtedly went down well in
both countries. Basically humanitarian,
he can see the immense problems they
face. As well as seeing their short-
comings, he wanted to see what posi-
tive achievements they had to their
credit. As an administrator and a man,
his heart went out to them in the
immensity of their tasks and I think
they realised that he was sincerely
interested in their problc . Though
himself in a more fortunate position,
with a prosperous and stable country
to administer, he had no sense of
superiority. In fact, he had only a sense
of thankfulness that the problems he
faced were of nowhere near the same
magnitude.
Paradoxically Holt in Taiwan had to
walk the tightrope almost as carefully
as in Cambodia, though Australia and
Taiwan have basically the same appre-
In Cambodia
hension of the power of Mainland
China.
Holt arrived in Taiwan as fit as a
fiddle, bursting with energy, incorrigibly
cheerful despite an exhausting week in
climates where a man’s shirt sticks con-
tinuously to his back. This seems to be
part of Holt’s charm for the Asians
-—the impression he conveys that de-
spite his 58 years he very definitely
belongs to the “in generation.” Nobody
is too unimportant for his interest. He
talks as animatedly with the least im-
portant figure as he does with the nobs.
He seems to exude the unaggressive
egalitarianism which several thoughtful
Asians have told me is increasingly be-
coming the ha’ mark of the better type
of Australian in Asia.
In Taiwan he received the impression
that the younger generation of admin-
istrators is highly pragmatic. They
have not altogether lost hope that the
future will see them back on the main-
land but they are content to patiently
await the outcome of events in Com-
munist China. While waiting they have
turned their attention to the develop-
ment of their island citadel. They cer-
tainly wanted to —and did —discuss de-
velopments inside Mainland China and
surprised Holt with the range of their
detailed knowledge of what was going
on. But sensibly practical, they did not
confine their talks to this subject but
got right down to bread-and-butter
questions.
While return to the mainland was
still for them a matter of faith, in the
interval they were prepared to deal
with the day-to-day problems of de-
veloping their island. But looming over
them was the shadow of President
Chiang Kai-shek, who, though now 80
years of age, still hopes to see the day
when he will rule over China again.
Chiang was the unknown factor on
Holt’s visit. Though the Australians did
not expect him to raise policy diver-
gences personally, not until the last
moment could they be certain about
whether or not this was going to be
raised by someone on his behalf. But at
the initial meeting (the formal dinner)
the Generalissimo was the essence of
cordiality. He did not mention the sub-
jects of Australian wheat sales to Com-
munist China, Australia’s recognition of
Mongolia, or Australia’s two Chinas
policy. Instead he praised Australia for
the interest it was showing and the role
it was playing in Asia. Holt had pre-
pared himself to defend Australia’s
policies on these issues but found he
did not need to.
For Holt his whole tour was a per-
sonal triumph. But with attractive
humility he confesed in Taipei that the
trip for him was most important as an
educati a. It had, he said, added to his
knowledge and knowledge always added
to understanding. I do not think the
trip changed any of Holt’s basic views.
But, a good listener and a perceptive,
quick observer who has the practical
politician’s capacity to judge what is
going on by such mundane—but usually
accurate yardsticks as the rate of
building activity, the growth in school
populations, the cleanliness of a city,
the number of times a week there is a
garbage disposal service, the duration
and number of power blackouts, the
state of the water supply and such
things, Holt fitted his views into a dif-
ferent context of personal experience.
If he started off looking for short-
comings, he ended sympathetically
appreciating the immensity of the prob-
lems whether they existed in non-aligned
Cambodia or Laos or in anti-Communist
Taiwan and South Korea. He kept his
speeches short and dignified. If of neces-
sity they had mostly to be platitudinous,
he infused into them what appears to
be his genuine sympathy for the under-
developed countries of Asia. It was his
warmth, I believe, that secured for him
the rapport he achieved with Asian
leaders whose views were often as wide
apart as their countries were close.
Fundamentally, as Holt modestly ad-
mits, the trip was designed to broaden
his education, and he felt he achieved
his object. It will be interesting to see
what results this broadening produces
in the future.

WHAT TO DO?
They wisely called in LIQUID AIR, and our consultant literally had a gas idea. He
suggested LIQUID AlR’s Turbo-cutter, the only gas-turbine cutter available in
Australia. Weighing in at just 26 lbs., this precision machine cuts anywhere you can take oxygen and
fuel gas, and is driven by the cutting oxygen— without loss of gas. Amazing? There’s more.
Amongst other things, the versatile Turbo-cutter, on its special track, cuts straight lines on plate to
7", square or bevelled. Parallel cuts from 7§" to 16f" wide. It makes edge preparation easy, and a
turntable device allows production cutting of circles from \ to 11f" radius. You can even hand guide
it over any surface, including rough, scaled or buckled.
Solving problems for clients like Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd. is one reason why LIQUID AIR
has achieved such a remarkable reputation for service. There are others. A complete range of gases
and accessories. Prompt, on-time deliveries. And assistance, anytime, day or night. (Call us, if

BRAMBLES
NEW
For better
Service
Australian Owned — Australia Wide
Volume 4, No. 2.
April, 1967
Transport is an integral part of Australia’s
economic growth. Brambles plays its part by
continually matching this national growth
with new facilities and services.
QUEENSLAND: Brambles has recently acquired
a new transport terminal and warehouse at
Hendra, Brisbane, to provide space and facili-
ties to keep pace with the rapidly expanding
operation in Queensland. The property, which
was brought into operation in January of this
year, includes a terminal of eight acres and a
warehouse area of more that 40,000 square feet,
plus workshops, parking areas and other facili-
ties. Located two miles from the wharves and
six miles from Brisbane G.P.O., the terminal is
convenient to the major commercial centres and
provides an ideal location for the provision of
comprehensive transport services. The photo-
graph below shows a section of the terminal
area and warehouse.
SYDNEY: Brambles Industries Limited has
acquired the business and assets of the Dailey
Transport group of companies. These include a
customs and shipping agency, interstate trans-
port services, storage, heavy haulage and the
Taslines roll-on-roll-off ferry operation.
The Dailey companies will continue to offer their
personalised services under existing manage-
ment.


“Containerisation'is the ward today..and dig we do!
Containers have been used for more than
fifteen years in Australia, but today more
than ever before they are receiving attention
from every division of the transport industry.
“Containerisation” is basically a method of
carrying goods in reusable boxes which can
be readily transported by road, rail or sea.
Efficient transfer equipment such as cranes,
fork lift trucks and other handling equipment,
speeds cargo movement when containers
are used. Containers also reduce damage to
fragile goods and prevent pilfering.
Australia can match the world leaders in
modern shipping, capable of handling all
types of cargo. The ‘PRINCESS OF TAS-
MANIA’ went into service in 1959, as Aust-
ralia’s first roll-on-roll-off ferry, between the
Port of Melbourne and Tasmania. Since then,
seven more roll-on-roll-off ferries have been
added to the coastal fleet and roll-on-roll-off
services now operate from Sydney to Tas-
mania, Melbourne to Tasmania, and Port
Adelaide to Port Lincoln and Kangaroo
Island.
But the ships are not enough. National trans-
port companies, such as Brambles, play a
major role in providing an efficient service,
whether goods are despatched by container
or more conventional means. Goods are
collected for shipment, loaded onto trailers
or into containers and the necessary dis-
tribution services are provided at the ports
of destination, giving industry the complete
personalised door-to-door service it looks
for today. Every day throughout Australia,
Brambles are loading “Searoad” shipments
accepting full responsibility for the complete
door-to-door operation.
As roll-on-roll-off facilities expand and as
the use of containers for overseas trade
develops, Australian industry can look to
Brambles Transport to provide complete and
co-ordinated transport services at all points.

Many old buildings and dimension stone
walls in Sydney have been built straight
on the ground, instead of on conven-
tional footings or solid rock some way
below the surface.
When excavation is necessary alongside
such buildings, it is a complex problem
to underpin and preserve the foundation
from damage. Two recent projects illus-
trate this very well.
One project involved the underpinning
of a building at Elizabeth Bay during ex-
cavation of the site for a Senior Citizens
Welfare Centre and the other was at
Paddington, at the Overseas Telecom-
munications Commission’s building.
The OTC project called for the use of steel beams
prefabricated as triangular trusses and infilled be
(ween the webs of the upright beams with concrete
slabs The difficulty was to excavate and form an
18-inch by 12-inch concrete beam under the wall
before placing the steelwork to rock level
The Elizabeth Bay project involved underpinning frome units built
only on beams supported by sand. Underpinning was by conventional
means using brickwork, but the difficulty was to support the stonework
so that it would not drop and to adequately timber shore each bay to
prevent the tine sand from running out from behind the wall
Excavation under wafer presents its owr problems principally
because the operator cannot see the bed of the waterway in which
he is working Brambles helped n the laying of high-voltage power
cables across Sydney Harbour by excavating stone from the harbour
bed to form a trench m which the cable was laid T wo divers who
can be seen in the picture, drilled and blasted rock from the bed of
the harbour to form the channel which was up to 35 feet deep


OVERSEAS
The clash between Moscow
and Hanoi in Laos
LAOS’ GOOD FORTUNE to have
remained aloof from the Vietnam war
is usually explained by reference to the
motives of the “Great Powers” inter-
ested in Laos: the North Vietnamese,
for instance, can no longer spare the
men or the materials for any new
offensives in Laos because of their in-
volvement in the South. The U.S. for
its part does not want to open up a
“second front” there to “block” the
Ho Chi Minh Trail, since it does not
have the troops to squander in an
operation whose strategic utility is any
way dubious. The fact that the tempo
of the Laotian war has slowed down
while the Vietnamese war has escalated
is often said to constitute evidence of a
tacit agreement between the two of
them to “leave Laos alone” and to
concentrate on the more pressing busi-
ness elsewhere.
But the more closely the Laotian
scene is examined, the less satisfactory
this “story” becomes as a complete
explanation of its tranquillity. It is
true that there are no American
ground troops in Laos (or at least
nobody has given adequate proof that
there are), nor have there been any
major Communist offensives for more
than two years. But if disengagement
implies a reduction by both sides of
their “presence” in Laos, there has been
none. The North Vietnamese still keep
between 25,000 and 30,000 troops there
and the Americans have given Prince
Souvanna Phouma’s Government all
the aid they can, short of actually com-
mitting troops. Nor has there been any
“disengagement” based on an informal
agreement to respect existing “spheres
of influence” in Laos. The American
aid is not being used by the Vientiane
Government to maintain the military
status quo but to change it in their
own favor. With the Royal Laotian
Army strengthened by American
equipment and backed up by the
American Air Force, and the Pathet
Lao weakened by the fall in the num-
ber of North Vietnamese troops
integrated in their ranks, the Vientiane
Government now has a superiority
both in firepower and mobility which
it has used to clear the Pathet Lao
from areas which they overran during
the past six years.
These clearing operations have made
steady progress during the past two
years. The Communists have been
completely cleared from Champassak
and Sayabouri provinces (the only two
Laotian provinces on the west side of
the Mekong); their position has been
weakened in the areas immediately
north and south of the Plain of Jars,
and although they still control the
Plain itself, the crucial Route Nationale
7 -- the only supply line with North
Vietnam is now vulnerable to con-
tinual harassment by Meo guerillas
operating from the hills. In the far
south, the Pathet Lao have been
pushed back from the Mekong along
the entire “Panhandle” of Laos all the
way fro,m Thakkhak to Pakse, and the
Royal Laotian Government control
now extends as far east as the towns
of Saravane and Attopeu (Attopeu
itself is contested and was recently the
scene of heavy fighting).
These operations have brought the
Royal Laotian Army very close to the
“sensitive areas” which Hanoi deploys
25,000-odd troops to defend: in the
south, the eastern half of the “Pan-
handle” through which runs the Ho
Chi Minh Trail, and in the north-east
the regions contiguous to North Viet-
nam and China. There is a mass of
evidence which points to an American
A Far Eastern
Economic Review Report
plan to carry out a “backdoor” attack
on these areas. The Royal Laotian Army
receives day-by-day air support from
the American Air Force (and the Royal
Laotian Air Force flying American-built
T-28s out of the USAF Air Base at
Udon); it is equipped with American
weapons, and supplied in the remote
areas by the ClA’s own Air America.
Moreover, its troop strength can only
be maintained at 50,000 (a huge size for
a country of only one and a half mil-
lion) because of American willingness
to underwrite the Laotian budget and
foreign exchange account at an average
of about $lO million per annum.
It misses the point to argue that
Hanoi does nothing to stop the Royal
Laotian Army because it knows it
could destroy it standing on its head
and therefore cannot be bothered to hit
back until the Laotians are unwise
Premier Souvarvia Phouma (left) with
the King of Laos
enough to press too far. Such reticence
would make sense if the Royal Laotian
Army were pottering around on its own,
paying off some old scores with the
Pathet Lao while the Americans kept to
their bases in Thailand. But with the
Laotians receiving enthusiastic support
from the United States all along the
line, and with Souvanna’s complete
dependence on the United States econ-
omically, it would be logical for the
North Vietnamese to conclude that the
United States was using its “puppet,”
the Vientiane Government, to open up
a second front in Laos with the Royal
Laotian Army acting as the thin end of
the American wedge. In other words,
the American strategy would be to push
the Laotian Ar.my right up to the “sensi-
tive areas” so as to provoke a North
Vietnamese retaliation, and to use this
as a pretext for their own intervention.
And yet the North Vietnamese remain
inactive, keeping their troops strung
out along the Ho Chi Minh Trail (with
the occasional sally into Royalist terri-
tory to give their “transit” troops some
battle experience before reaching the
South) and not taking any steps to aid
their hard-pressed ally, the Pathet Lao.
The explanation of this “paradox” is
not to be found in any tacit agreement
between Washington and Hanoi. To
expect Hanoi to respect American
assurances not to use Laotian territory
for offensive purposes when America is
deliberately stepping up the pressure
against Hanoi almost daily is wildly im-
plausible. If any tacit agreement exists
it is between the Vientiane Government
(or more accurately Prince Souvanna
Phouma) and Hanoi, with the Soviet

Union acting as a bridge between the
two an understanding based on
Souvanna Phouma’s good relations with
the U.S.S.R. as well as the Western
powers. Somewhat unexpectedly, Sou-
vanna’s diplomatic respectability turns
out to be a key factor in preserving
stability not only in Laos itself but
with Thailand’s extreme sensitivity to
events in Laos, and Cambodia’s fears of
Pathet Lao designs on her northern
provinces of Stung Treng and Ratana-
kiri for these two countries as well.
Because there has been a tendency
among Western powers to regard the
Royal Laotian Government as some-
thing of a joke, they have tended to
overlook this crucial role which its
Prime Minister is playing.
That Souvanna should be on good
terms with the Russians is entirely the
result of the consistency with which he
has pursued his “neutralist” objectives
during the past ten years. His diplom-
acy has always exhibited two themes:
first, his refusal to connive in the
Dullesian policy of setting up a Thai-
type regime in Vientiane “willing and
able to resist Communist subversion and
aggression” (an American official’s des-
cription of the Laotian Rightists in
1962). Secondly, his persistent attempts
to bridge the differences between the
Rightists, the Neutralists, and the Pathet
Lao. This explains why he could not
join the 1958 Phoui Sannanikone Gov-
ernment which abruptly abandoned
Souvanna’s tripartite neutralism (with
the full support of the Eisenhower Ad-
ministration), and why in 1962 he was
prepared to enter into an alliance with
the Pathet Lao to oppose the American-
backed Boun Oum/Phoumi Nosavan
regime which was bent on destroying the
Pathet Lao once and for all —again
with full American support. In spite of
his increasing reliance on the U.S. be-
tween 1962 and now, Souvanna has
persistently stated that he would never
agree to American troops in Laos, and
this assurance is undoubtedly the prin-
cipal reason for continued Soviet sup-
port for him.
Current Soviet thinking on Laos is
clearly stated in an article on the Lao-
tian situation in the January edition of
the Soviet weekly .magazine “New
Times,” which of course faithfully
echoes Government thinking. Predict-
ably, the article accuses the U.S. of
withdrawing “only part of its' military
personnel” after the 1962 Geneva agree-
ments, and of sending in servicemen
“disguised as personnel of civilian and
semi-civilian agencies” while “continu-
ing to bring in arms.” But nowhere is
Souvanna himself blamed for this, which
is an extraordinary oversight, since he
is fully responsible for the American
“presence” in Laos. Instead, the article
avoids attacking Souvanna, by resur-
recting the old distinction between
“Rightists” and “Neutralists” (the latter
referred to in the article as “The Prince
and his supporters”) which has long
ceased to be a meaningful distinction
in Vientiane politics. It is the “Right-
ists” who are accused of putting strong
pressure on the Kong Le neutralists

(which resulted in Kong Le’s exile to
Indonesia), although again this was
done with Souvanna’s complete compli-
ance.
The fact that the Russians bend over
backwards to avoid attacking Souvanna,
and last year even invited him and
King Savang Vatthana on a State visit
to Moscow, is a clear indication not
only that he is still useful to them but
also that they are prepared to give him
the benefit of the doubt in spite of his
co-operation in “turning the country
into a base in America’s dirty war in
Vietnam.” From the Russian point of
view,, Souvanna acts as a kind of “safety
valve” against American intervention
in Laos were the U.S. to insist on
sending in troops, the Co,mmunists could
rely on Souvanna to resign or retire to
the Plain of Jars as he has always done
in the past in the face of similar Ameri-
can moves which would in itself be
a danger sign to the Communists, and
a signal that the Laotian crisis was
about to open up once again. But with
Souvanna firmly in office, and on good
ter,ms with the Americans, the Com-
munists can be confident that Washing-
ton’s commitment was being kept within
manageable limits.
The remarkable restraint which Hanoi
has shown in Laos suggests that the
North Vietnamese are prepared to ac-
cept the Soviet view of Souvanna’s role,
and to regard the clearing operation of
the Royal Laotian Army as part of a
purely domestic quarrel with the Pathet
Lao. But this identity of outlook be-
tween Moscow and Hanoi is only likely
to last as long as the Vietnam crisis
remains unsolved. The long-term
objectives of the U.S.S.R. and Hanoi in
Laos are opposed, and on the issue of
whether Laos should be preserved as
an independent State, or should be
absorbed into a Hanoi-dominated Indo-
Chinese federation, Hanoi’s view is
nearer to Peking’s than to Moscow’s.
With the Vietnam war obstructing
the detente between Moscow and Wash-
ington, it is clearly in the Kremlin’s in-
terests to bring the war to an end as
soon as possible. This policy must in-
volve building up an independent and
genuinely neutral Laos which could
act as a buffer State between Vietnam
(whether united under Hanoi, or still
divided with a neutralist regime in the
South) and Thailand. If Laos were to
remain weak and divided, on the other
hand, there would be ample scope for
continuing subversion and for mount-
ing “wars of national liberation” indefi-
nitely irrespective of whether a
settlement was reached in the South.
But it coincides with neither Hanoi’s
nor Peking’s declared interest to “seal
up” the Communist sphere of influence
in Indo-China by building up a neutra-
list cordon sanitaire which would pre-
sumably include Cambodia as well as
Laos. As long ago as 1951 Ho Chi Minh
declared his ambition to “bring about a
federation of the States of Vietnam,
Laos, and Cambodia.” This project
stems not so much from an ideological
imperialism pure and simple but from
the conviction that a united Vietnam
(“The Chile of the Far East”) could
never be secure unless the neighboring
countries were ruled by friendly
preferably Communist - governments.
Peking undoubtedly supports Hanoi
to the full. The Russian plan is obnoxi-
ous to her because it allows for an
“unliberated” Thailand protected by the
two neutral States, free to rely on the
military backing of the United States.
So to expel the United States fully
from South-East Asia, Peking cannot
afford to support any guarantee or
treaty which would freeze the status
quo in Indo-China. This is why the
Chinese have refused Prince Sihanouk
a guarantee of his frontiers.
Therefore, as long as her involvement
in the South makes it impossible for her
to fight two wars on two fronts at the
same time, it is in Hanoi’s interests to
observe the Soviet-maintained neutrality
of Laos. But once they have accom-
plished their aims in the South (if they
ever do) the North Vietnamese are
likely to adopt a hard line in Laos
overnight. The disappearance of Laos
as an independent State would follow
almost as rapidly.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Music
Meale’s hard night’s work
By DAVID SALTER
Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Con-
ductor, Dean Dixon; soloist, Ladislav
Jasek. Town Hall, Sydney.
MR. RICHARD MEALE has written
another piece and critics must make
that painful journey to the typewriter
to tap out what they didn’t think. I
attended the third airing of “Nocturnes”
(to avoid any possibilities of misper-
formance) and found there was indeed
very little to think of the work at all.
It is not that the work is disappointing
—it is, I feel, an improvement on the
1966 model Meale, but approached
simply as a composition of absolute
music, “Nocturnes” seemed to take too
long in stating too little.
I must admit that I deliberately
ignored the astrological/poetic consid-
eration which Mr. Meale described as
the foundations of his piece.
As an experience, “Nocturnes” was
Richard Meale
no heart - stopper.
The concertante
group of vibra-
phone, harp, and
celeste became over-
bearing (something
akin to an over-
worked stereo-
phonic mixture of
Lionel H a m p ton
and Tinkerbell),
and the legion of
percussion players
had more to do
t h r o u ghout the
work than can be
taken with com-
fort in an entire
evening. With the
exception of “Nadir,” which never be-
gan to sound like anything at all, let
alone develop, the six movements had
little to differentiate themselves save
variations in tempo and dynamics. “Peri-
gee” was frantic and “Apogee” more
relaxed, but in texture their similarities
managed to obscure the detail and con-
trasts one would expect to find in these
two extremes.
What is encouraging, however, in
“Nocturnes” is the evidence that Meale
is composing more. His previous efforts,
especially the recent “Nagauta,” are
masterworks in the art of spinning out
a few passages of actual composition
until they occupy ten minutes or so.
There is a good deal of actual writing
in “Nocturnes,” and the occasional
moments of orchestral density reveal a
growing control of counterpoint and
instrumental organisation. If, in his
next piece, Mr. Meale concentrates his
thoughts and his technique into a
shorter space of time, who knows?
For the first time in many years of
ABC programming we heard the con-
certo as the final item. As soloist in
the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto, Ladi-
slav Jasek presented an attractively
“small” reading. Jasek, who has re-
turned to Australia to teach at the
Queensland Conservatorium, must be
recognised as an invaluable asset in
the nation-wide task of producing com-
petent professional string players.

Slow motion

Eh? Henry Livings. Community
Theatre, Killara, Sydney.
The Good Soldier Schweik. Hasek.
New, Sydney.
The Lion in Winter. James Goldman.
Independent, Sydney.
“EH?”, SET IN present-day northern
England, and “The Good Soldier
Schweik,” set in Czechoslovakia during
World War I, are two comedies which
both have as heroes the kind of people
who inevitably gum up the works.
Through the comic misadventures of
the good-natured Schweik (delightfully
played by John Armstrong) Jaroslav
Hasek makes a devastating criticism of
the oppressive Austrian bureaucracy
under which Czechoslovakia suffered at
that time, of the Austrian Army in
which the Czech soldiers were forced
to serve, and of war in general.
Some people would see certain
similarities between the position of
Czechoslovakia in 1914 and its position
today, but, since the New Theatre is
committed to supporting the present
regime in Czechoslovakia, it is con-
cerned to emphasise Hasek’s criticism of
war rather than his criticism of Austrian
rule. This has led the New Theatre
to end the play (which consists of a
number of episodes from the novel) in
a heavy-handed fashion, with Schweik
stomping off the stage declaring, in a
most un-Schweik-like way, “All right.
Fight your own bloody wars.”
But Hasek, left to himself, has the
lightest of touches and an unerring aim.
In “Eh?”, however, I was unable to-
decide what Henry Livings is about.
Valentine Brose is a young man
whose job in the boiler-room of a
factory requires him to do little more
than press a button, but he cannot
even get that right. Unlike “Mon
Oncle,” whose awkward individuality
put him at odds with all gadgetry,
young Brose is almost entirely feature-
less. I am afraid I was on the side
of the eh? saying Works Manager who,
although a square, is at least there.
I do think that I might have liked
this play better in a different produc-
tion. For one thing it is too slow and
for another Kerry Francis is all at sea
as Brose. John Gray, Ron Haddrick,
Lyndall Barbour, and Jasmine Green-
field show themselves as talented char-
acter-actors, but they seemed somehow
to be acting in slow motion.
In recent years most history plays
have been about one or other of the
Plantagenets. Henry 11, with or without
Thomas Becket, is always popping up,
and in “Left-Handed Liberty” his son,
John, had a play to himself. In “The
Lion in Winter” James Goldman has
had the bright idea of assembling the
whole family, including Henry himself,
his redoubtable wife, Eleanor of Aqui-
taine, his three unruly sons, Richard,
Geoffrey, and John, who are busy
squabbling over the crown, his mistress,
Alais Capet, and her brother, King
Philip of France.
Early in the piece it almost seemed
that, as well as a racy pen and a
theatrical flair, James Goldman might
have something interesting to say about
the Plantagenets. But, as the play wears
on, it becomes clear that his explana-
tions do not rise much above the level
of Hollywood.
The best thing about “The Lion in
Winter” is that it offers a vehicle for
Jacqueline Kott who plays the fas-
cinating but Machiavellian Queen
Eleanor in the grand manner. Ron
Graham has a good voice and presence
as Henry 11, while Kerry McGuire is
romantically pathetic as the pretty
Alais. Of the sons, Sean Scully has the
most promising part as the knock-kneed,
pimply adolescent John.
AH three of the above productions
meander along with a provincial tard-
iness. Since all are comedies there is
no excuse for the producers not crack-
ing the whip and speeding them along.

Showing her paces
John Norman in “The Collection.” Q
Group, AMP Theatre, Sydney.
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Georgy Girl. Director, Silvio Narizzano.
Contempt. Director, Jean-Luc Godard.
LYNN REDGRAVE, who in her small
role was responsible for the only signs
of life displayed by that flaccid film
“Girl With Green Eyes,” gets a real
opportunity to show her paces in the
title role of “Georgy Girl.” Free-swing-
ing, athletic paces they are, too, in a
breezy and refreshing movie one of
the most likable and least pretentious
to come from the Old Dart since the
English Cinema began getting too big
for its Carnaby Street boots.
Georgy is a humorous, warm-hearted
girl, only too conscious since she is
never allowed to forget it that she is
too big and too fat, who lives vicariously
through her sexually successful girl-
friend, falls for the friend’s lover, and
takes over their unwanted baby.
Both Miss Redgrave and Silvio Nariz-
zano have been wise enough to play
down the pathetic aspects of the charac-
ter; the avoidance of an easy senti-
mentality makes the movie more genu-
inely touching. Narizzano’s free-wheel-
ing direction underlines the humor,
often almost farcical, of the situations
it’s not a disciplined film, its hap-
hazard construction divertingly echoes
the slapdash quality of Georgy’s own
approach to the world.
Though the emphasis never really
shifts from Lynn Redgrave, the rest of
the cast Alan Bates, James Mason,
Charlotte Rampling give bravura
performances; Ken Higgins’ photog-
raphy is fine, and Alexander Paris’
score, though perhaps a little self-
conscious, is always entertaining.
The combination of Godard,
Jacqueline Kott and Michael Laurence
in “The Lion in Winter.” Independent,
Sydney.
Moravia, and Bardot is a weird and
not particularly successful one. Bardot
always looks enchanting, of course, but
there is no point in anybody pretending
she’s a great actress; Moravia, though
“Contempt” is still vaguely based on
his novel, “A Ghost At Noon,” seems to
have got lost in the shuffle.
This isn’t by any means a typical
Godard film - for one thing, he starts
his story at the beginning and tells it
straightforwardly through to the end,
which isn’t like our Jean-Luc. It’s a
simple enough tale a young wife
grows to despise her husband, allows
him to drive her into the arms of his
film-producer boss, and finally to meet
her death in a meaningless accident.
The movie is dubbed into flat Eng-
lish and, apart from the photography,
its main interest is in the strange
appearance of director Fritz Lang
playing the role of director Fritz Lang.
He’s lousy in the part, too.

Romantic triumph
By ELWYN LYNN
Roland Wakelin Retrospective. Art Gal-
lery of N.S.W., Sydney.
William Gear. Hungry Horse, Sydney.
Kenneth Rowell, Macquarie Galleries,
Sydney, and South Yarra, Melbourne.
TWO CURRENT SHOWS are ready-
made for any venturesome investigator
who might like to do a Ph.D. on peri-
pheral culture: William Gear is a Scot
involved in the triangular cultural ex-
change between Edinburgh, Paris, and
London that has gone on since 1600,
and Roland Wakelin, now 80 and show-
ing 92 paintings from 1915 to 1966, is
a case of curiously indirect development
in isolation. In 1913 he saw reproduc-
tions of Duchamp’s Nude Descending a
Staircase and of Cezanne and Gauguin
and heard of Gilman, Gore, and Gin-
ner from Norah Simpson, who had just
returned from Europe; before seeing a
real Cezanne he called his cottage by
the master’s name, and without having
seen Delaunay, whose Orphism was akin
to the Synchronism evolved in 1912 in
Paris by Morgan Russel and S. Mac-
donald Wright (whose brother’s book on
recent art he had read), he devised in
1919 with De Maistre a style they called
Color Music of fresh, lively patches
of flat color. It was a style that Wakelin
was to return to between 1960 and 1963.
Color Music and the slightly veiled
impressionism of 1915 and T 6 (with a
reduction in vibrance in Gilman’s man-
ner) so distressed the establishment,
that one inclines to say that the avant-
garde in a peripheral culture is the
derriere of the cosmopolitan centres, but
avant-garde may have a more absolute
meaning than is generally accorded it;
at any time the avant-garde artist is
almost a man without a past and is not
the romantic who shuns society but the
artist dedicated to the subversion of
accepted forms. Artists like Goya, Bosch,
Dubuffet, and even Tui*ner are peren-
nial rebels.
Wakelin did not push his experiments
because he fell between, or more gen-
erally kept a balance between, romantic
and avant-garde styles and attitudes.
When he went to London in 1922 he
adopted the dullness of English deriva-
tiveness, but a trip to' Paris elicited the
sharp hues and the flickering immedi-
acy of In the Luxembourg Gardens, No.
1; yet, at the same time, he reduced
color in the small Battersea Bridge
(1924) that has the fine architectural
amplitude of his Black Mountain of
1944.
That he returned to Australia divided
between the use of small broken, vibra-
ting touches and flat planes of light
a division that he often bridged success-
fully should not surprise, for London
and Paris were painting adulterated and
eclectic versions of Impressionism,
Cezanne, Delaunay, and Cubism. It was
Mondrian, in Holland, and Malevitch,
in Russia, who were to develop the
tenets of Cubism and its associated
movements.
English, French, and Australian “ad-
vanced” painting became obsessed with
shallow, patterned, sterile compositions
and people and pumpkins were dis-
posed as if every object was nature
morte; Wakelin did some dull, routine
pieces between 1930 and 1935, but a
painting of the Terrigal Skillion in 1926
foreshadowed, with its formidable shape
and divisive surface, a mode that he
was to use with quiet authority. Slabs
of paint, looking like congealed light,
were to stress monumental forms, while
flecks and mottling were to give the
solid shapes an interior flicker; it
occurs in the clouds of Storm Over the
Bay (1935), in Romantic Landscape
(1937), and in a view of the old Fisher
Library, where the pulsating and stiller
areas just cohere. They don’t in St.
Peter’s, Watson’s Bay, because the cen-
tral church won’t fuse happily with the
sky and harbor.
When he was to take a less formal
view of light, let it act emotionally in
the nocturne, Crepuscule (1924) or
break from clouds in Black Mountain
and Breezy Day, North Ryde (1948) to
cast fugitive shadows over hill, field,
and houses, he obtained a serene ease
of breadth of movement, somewhat like
that of Lloyd Rees (who is to be simi-
larly honored next year) and a balmy
romanticism and golden utopianism that
recalls happy Heidelberg rather than
the cerebral exercises of color theorists.
The romantic triumphed in Wakelin,
and happily the forces that might have
cast him in the role of permanent pro-
gressive came too late.
William Gear combines cerebrally
disposed abstractions of cliff and tree

ist yellows, blues, and light oranges in
a set of oils that from 1961 to 1964
(Gear is now 52) show a deepening of
mature and sensitive judgment. As one
title indicates, he lends his abstracted
landscapes an heroic presence without
heroics, and he has obvious connections
with our young painters, who are turn-
ing to the expressive qualities of pure
color (Aspden) and non-color (Har-
pur).
To such and Gear, art is pure evoca-
tives symbol, but Kenneth Rowell’s
designs and sets have to conjure up,
without diminishing, the spirit of play,
ballet, and opera. It’s a tight-rope
journey that he makes with appropriate
skill, calculation, and a good designer’s
reverent modesty. Like Gear and Wake-
lin at their best, Rowell exemplifies the
virtue of underplaying one’s hand.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
“Super spread” and the dairyfarmers
IT WILL BE fascinating to see whether Marrickville
Margarine succeed in their great new advertising and pro-
motion campaign. The new product, which does undoubtedly
conform to cooking margarine specifications, is being pro-
moted as a table margarine. It is, as required by law, 90 per-
cent animal fat and 10 percent vegetable oil. The difficulty
the company will have will be in persuading the public that it
is in fact something more than the simple old-fashioned
cooking margarine. It does taste a little more buttery and it
spreads better, but its main components are the same as those
of other cooking margarines. Not, of course, that there is any-
thing wrong or novel in people using cooking margarine on
their bread! Pensioners and other less affluent people have
been doing it for many a year. The real question is whether
customers can be persuaded to pay a premium of 15 or 16
cents a pound, the amount by which the new “super spread”
exceeds the price of other cooking margarines.
There will be some people hoping that the new product
is not too successful. The vegetable oil growers, whose inter-
ests Marrickville has so vigorously canvassed in the past,
have nothing to gain by the success of a product which is
mainly tallow. The booming, go-go oilseeds of former Mar-
rickville publicity have been left out on a limb. And
sufferers from heart disease get no relief from the new pro-
duct, which is more saturated with those naughty cholesterols
than even butter.
The cynic might ask Marrickville if this new product is
cheaper than other table margarines, Dinkum Aussie and
OK by the Government, just what was Mrs. Jones getting
so upset about?
Changing the tack somewhat, the dairy hoys are really
being shown up as unimaginative, complacent conservatives.
Why on earth cannot they get out and compete? Here are
two suggestions for them. First make butter spreadable at
winter temperatures. Many people must turn to margarine
from the frustration of having bits of solid unspreadable
butter wreck their breakfast toast or carry away the middle
of their piece of bread. It only needs a tiny bit of safflower
oil mixed into the butter to make it as workable as any table
margarine. And second, packaging. A little plastic carton as
used by one margarine manufacturer would work wonders
in sales. The familiar oil-paper wrapping is messy and time-
wasting, the cause of cursing in millions of households each
day.
But when all is said and done, Marrickville Margarine
must get full marks for its tireless efforts against Government
restrictions. The laws against free competition are an inde-
fensible mollycoddling of entrenched interests. Consumers
should be free to do business with whom they wish, to buy
whatever is offered for sale. That is what free enterprise is
about. Dairying, like other industries, must pay its way by

MEN AND MATTERS
THE MAN WHO recently told the
British newspaper industry what was
wrong with it (and who is paid hand-
somely to be incisively rude to irtdustry
around the world) has just spent a
couple of weeks looking at the Aus-
tralian operations of his world-wide
economic research organisation—and
drumming up more business.
Geoffrey Browne, the short and solid,
bustling, aggressive 59-year-old manag-
ing director of the Economist Intelli-
gence Unit, is always looking for busi-
ness. The bigwig guests who attended
a cocktail party in his honor last week
in Sydney (Sir James Vernon, Leslie
Bury, and so on) ended up getting a
20-minute burst on the merits of the
EIU.
Born in Shanghai, where he did his
elementary schooling, Geoffrey Browne
took up a cadetship in the Hong Kong
and Shanghai Bank before going off to
the London School of Economics to get
first-class honors in agricultural
economics. After a spell with the
National Farmers Union (where he
helped fashion the farm support
schemes that have helped keep Britain
out of the Common Market), he was
invited in 1947 by the editor of the
“Economist” (Sir Geoffrey Crowther)
to set up an economic research depart-
ment within the magazine to answer
questions. So great was the outside
demand for information that the depart-
ment began charg-
ing £5 a question
and the busi-
ness snowballed.
Twenty years later
the EIU, the
world’s big gest
private enterprise
employer of econ-
omics graduates
(there are 150 on
the staff) and the
world’s big gest
economic research
outfit, earns far
more profit than the “Economist” does.
And more than half comes from the
U.S.
EXPATRIATES FROM Adelaide,
where they were at St. Peters and the
University, the two Bridgland brothers,
who moved up to top positions in
ICIANZ’s executive hierarchy last
week, have ploughed widely different
furrows since joining the group they’ve
been with most of their working lives.
In his thirty or so years with ICIANZ,
Mr. L. C. Bridgland, the elder, has fol-
lowed accountancy and commercial
stars (he’s a commerce graduate) and at
one time was assistant company secre-
*tzfry. His young brother M.D. has al-
ways been on the technical side, in
develop fnent and production. After get-
M. D. Bridgland
L. C. Bridgland
Geoff Browne
ting his M.Sc., he started at ICIANZ
in 1945 as a chemist at Deer Park, was
for ten years technical manager of dyes
and fabrics, and in 1962 went to Balm
Paints, a subsidiary. Since 1962, L.C.
has been manager of commercial ser-
vices and now, on his appointment as
an executive director, succeeds Mr. Eric
Sorensen, who is retiring after 41 years’
service, latterly as finance director.
Mr. M. D. Bridgland, who becomes
managing director of Balm Paints, has
been operations manager of that com-
pany since 1962, and was made a
director of it a year later. He gets his
opportunity by the translation of Mr.
E. P. Sanford, Balm’s former managing
director, to a seat on the parent com-
pany’s board, making that an eighteen-
man affair.


producing a product which is needed, a need which will be
demonstrated in market competition.
The dairy' industry must appreciate that it cannot continue
to survive for very long entirely on the present quota pro-
tection. Mr. Chaffey’s position in the N.S.W. Cabinet is by
no means assured, and the Liberals are getting increasingly
restive about the protection policy. Only Victoria is likely to
hold out in favor of retention of existing quotas when they
come up for review next year at the agricultural council
meeting. This last time it could be successfully argued that
the Agriculture Ministers should not be pressured by adver-
tising into changes in policy. By next year, with Marrickville
selling “cooking margarine,” the quotas will look sillier than
ever.
It is unrealistic to expect an immediate dismantlement of
quotas. But they must be expanded. It is not always realised
that by keeping quotas stable in the context of a popula-
tion increase, Governments are not merely holding mar-
garine’s share of the spread market at an artificially low level.
They are ensuring it steadily falls. Unless, that is, “cooking
margarine” slides by the side of the quotas. Which would
serve the protectionists right.
The stimulating game
WHETHER OR NOT the Arbitration Commission has
been trying to have a bit both ways as an economic stimu-
lator, it cannot be gainsaid that its decisions have the effect
of tipping the scales of effective demand in the economy
this way or that. So much is obvious from the revival in
spending following the combined rise in the basic wage
and margins last year, which the employers say has increased
the national wages bill by $345 million a year. Of course,
not all this goes to supplement effective demand (for in-
stance, the Treasury takes a fair slice of it), but enough of
it does to have a decidedly helpful effect on consumption,
even discounting dilution by price increases. As the nation’s
wage-fixing authority the Commission cannot opt out of the
stimulating business for all its pretence that it is an innocent
neutral in the matter.
At all times, and especially at the present juncture when
the banks are taking the bit of expansion and the Federal
Treasury is running a whopping deficit, it is up to the
Commission to look beyond the strict interpretation of its
function of adjudicating award wages in isolation to economic
effects, be those on spending, costs, or prices. There is no
doubt at all, for instance, that the effects on all three will
be considerable if it concedes the unions’ full claims for
an increase of $7.30 a week in the basic wage and $5.40
more a week for margins (leaving out the interim dollar
granted in December). Even with the Federal Government
taking a benevolent position in the current cases, the Com-
mission is unlikely to go nearly that far, nor is it likely to
agree with the employers and have a stand-still in wages
until next January to give industry the necessary time to
absorb the latest wage increases.
Getting at a point of compromise between these two
extremes is going to be a tortuous exercise for the Com-
mission. It is not only a matter of economic effects in a
situation where the economy is moving out of a trough. It
will be equally difficult to equate the employers’ claim for
a total wage with the conceptions certain Commissioners
apparently have of the place work-value cases should have
in considering it. Mr. Robinson caught at least Mr. Justice
Gallagher unawares last week when he said work-value
cases were taken care of in the roll-up of the sort of total
wage based on economic considerations the employers were
asking for. The vital point at issue here is that Gallagher
thinks that work-value cases are the best way of employees
obtaining wage increases. In other words, they should give
employees another layer on their wages over and above
that decided on economic considerations alone. If a majority
of the bench take this view, Mr. Robinson’s case for a total
wage could well be lost.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy 2 The trading banks approved

a week in the month ended March 8, or $ 16.1 m. a
week above the similar period of 1966. Total bank
lending committals stood at $4330.1m., $73.1m. more
than the January-February level.
The Federal Government is borrowing 50 million Swiss
francs ($10.2m.) on the Swiss market at percent.
March imports, $256.8m., exceeded exports of
$241.9m., thus throwing down a current account trade
deficit of $14.9m.; the nine months deficit is $40.8m.
For the markets 2 A much livelier atmosphere
has stirred Australian share markets, with, after all,
some leader guidance and some well-spread improve-
ment among industrials. The miners, thankfully, are
not only WMC.
London took on a series of mild forward kicks, chiefly
on expectations of a moderate Budget . . . Wall Street

The iron-ore pot was kept bubbling by Hamersley

vealed, among other things, hopes of sales a third more
than existing contracts by 1972.
Parent of CRA Rio Tinto-Zinc Corporation brought
earnings from $23,805,000 to $30,727,500 in 1966 and
held \l\ percent on higher capital; the increase was
attributed mainly to South Africa’s Palabora copper
mine . . . Barriers New Broken Hill and Zinc Cor-

March quarter; silver outputs fell.

Even takeovers sounded less exciting, although directors
of textiler Davies Coop rejected the Viyella bid by pre-
dicting a 1966-67 profit up by 25 percent and a

Doing its best for Sydney retailers, Lowes hoisted
dividend from 11 to 12 percent on earnings up by 13.9
percent to $266,934 and giving a 27.4 percent earning
rate . . . Doing its best, Anthony Hordern broke even in
the December half and won’t need to call a special meet-

for British Tobacco, which is offering 95 cents a share

Trade Practices Act
Prepare for proclamation day
By CROESUS
THE BUSINESS WORLD is currently
astir preparing -for. a May it hoped
would never arrive in Australia. The
word has gone out that on June 30 or
thereabouts the Trade Practices Act will
be Prodaimed. It is tempting to dub
t 0 commemorate Mr. B
M. Sneddens tireless work on it and
te assignation of steamroller put on
the bill by Mr L. M. Waite when it
was passed in December, 1965 or B
Day to mark the bonanza it is bringing
to lawyers and bureaucrats and the
origination of. the whole idea by oil
Garfield Barwick eight years ago. But
perhaps “P” Day will suffice At any
rate, for businessmen it is a thorough
pest, and as we suspected all along,
once the Federal Government got in by
the side gnte of the States . industrial
gaiden it would soon be roving widely
over the whole place.
With less than three months to go
before “P” Day, firms trading intra-
state only, and innocently thought to
be beyond the Act’s reach, have had to
reconsider their situation following a
recent intimation of the Trade Prac-
tices Commissioner, Mr. Roger Banner-
man, that such firms should consider
themselves within the purview of the
Act, whether the State in which they
operate has passed complementary
legislation to it or not. In other words,
they should now take the same pre-
cautionary steps as firms trading inter-
state. This also appeared to be the
import of remarks on the matter made
in Parliament, last week by the Federal
Attorney-General, Mr. N. H. Bowen.
Perhaps the most urgent of these pre-
cautions is to consider whether they are
parties to agreements and practices
registerabie under the Act. These must
be registered within 30 days of the Act
being proclaimed. Another would be
to satisfy themselves that, if they are
parties to agreements not registerabie
but nonetheless examinable under the
legislation, such agreements are fool-
proof against any charge that they mili-
tate against the public interest. Also,
those contemplating new agreements
and practices after June should now
be considering how to safeguard them
against possible anti-public-interest
charges. Unlike old agreements, which
presumably the Commissioner will take
time to sort out, new agreements and
practices covered by the Act are
examinable immediately they come into
effect. Further, in case anyone has.
lingering doubts whether, surreptitiously
or otherwise, he is concerned in collu-
sive bidding or tendering, this is the
time to unscramble. Such practices are
outlawed by the Act;
As the Commissioner sees it, then,
every trading and finance corporation
(broadly interpreted this means every
business in the country) is covered by
the Act and, until the matter is put to
the test of the High Court, nobody in
States without complementary legisla-
tion will be exempt from its far-reaching
clauses. Even if, as many may at present
be contemplating, it will take an awfully
long time to ferret offenders out, they
must not assume that, simply because in
the space of half a century or more
only a handful of charges were laid
under the old Australian Industries
Preservation Act, they will necessarily
escape the dragnet. The fact is that
after June it will be an offence not to
have registered an agreement or prac-
tice specified as registerabie under the
Act, and the hunt, started ever so
quietly, will be on. In these circum-
stances it is better to be sure than sorry
and let the lawyers have their Roman
Holiday.
The only State so far to have passed
complementary legislation to the Fed-

eral Act is Tasmania, and the only other
one to have given notice of its firm in-
tention to put one through is South
Australia, which will make the move
later this year. Perhaps it isn’t so sur-
prising that the Labor Governments in
these two States have not hesitated to
follow the Federal Government line, nor
that the Liberal Governments in the
other four States have been hesitating
plenty. In the two most important,
N.S.W.’s Government passed considera-
tion of the matter to a Cabinet sub-
committee appointed last December, but
it is still silent; Victoria’s has come out
dead against complementary legislation,
except that acting in vacuo it has
passed a separate Act outlawing col-
lusive tendering and bidding.
However, in Victoria, as we shall see,
all is not plain sailing for the Bolte
Government on this issue. The Govern-
ment’s hostility to the broad sweep ap-
proach and the take-it-or-leave-it man-
ner of the Federal Act was underlined
forcibly by Mr. R. J. Hamer, Minister
for Local Government and the A-G’s
spokesman in the Legislative Council, in
the debate on the Collusive Practices
Bill. He abhored the setting up of elab-
orate and costly machinery, as under
the Federal legislation, because there
was no need for it. The Victorian Gov-
ernment, he said, did not accept the
large burdens which the system of regis-
tration, filing, examination, investiga-
tion, and challenging of agreements
would entail for Australian industry
unless there was clear proof to justify
it. The Premier himself stated categori-
cally that the Collusive Practices legis-
lation was as far as the Government
would go.
With the coming State election in its
sights, last month the State Council of
the Liberal Party rebuffed the Premier
by passing a motion in favor of enact-
ing complementary State legislation to
the Federal Act. This was done despite
a strong protest by the secretary of
State Cabinet, Mr. Rafferty (presum-
ably under instructions from the
Premier), It is even possible, though,
that the latter had changed his tune
somewhat because Mr. Rafferty ex-
plained that Sir Henry only wanted to
see how effective the Federal Act
proved to be before complementing it in
Victoria. If the Liberal Government is
returned in Victoria on April 29 it
would not be obliged to act on the
resolution passed by the party’s State
Council, but it might be under strong
pressure to do so.
The Federal Government has cer-
tainly put the States on the spot by
assuming that the Act will be enforce-
able over the whole country, irrespect-
ive of the passage of complementary
State legislation. While this strategy
was probably the only one open to it in
the circumstances of some States not as
Commissioner Roger Bannerman
yet being willing to pass complementary
legislation, some of these States might
well say that their hands are being
forced and will dig their toes in accord-
ingly. In that case the matter may soon
get to the High Court. I sense that the
climate of opinion is changing in the
more recalcitrant States now the Fed-
eral Act is a fait accompli.
The Trade Practices Commissioner
has adopted a very sensible approach by
going round industry in advance of “P”
Day on a sort of persuasive-cum-educa«
tive mission. Mr. Bannerman, who is
44, was formerly first assistant secretary
in charge of the executive branch of the
Commonwealth Attorney-General’s de-
partment and takes a supremely de-
tached view of the rights and wrongs
of the legislation itself, admitting quite
frankly, that he has no practical experi-
ence of industry. So his initial task is
not an easy one. To assist it, the
Attorney-General’s Department is pre-
paring a guide book explaining the de-
tailed provisions of the legislation and
its various attachments. It is rather a
pity this is taking such a long time in
reaching those who will be affected.
Without playing down the Federal
legislation, Mr. Bannerman at this stage
is taking a helpful attitude. For instance,
his aim appears to be to get industry
to operate as far as possible on a con-
sultative rather than a litigative basis,
though doubtless when particular cases
are in mind he won’t hesitate to get
down to brass tacks and put them before
the Tribunal. The Tribunal’s president
is Justice Eggleston, assisted by Justices
Sweeney and Nimms of the Arbitration
Commission and Justice Kerr. None
of these is a stranger to industrial liti-
gation. One of the delays in getting the
machinery in motion has been the re-
cruitment of staff, of which there will
be about 55 in Canberra and 21 in the
State capitals. If these numbers would
seem to imply a rather high concentra-
tion of officials in Canberra, far from
the key areas of industry, Mr. Banner-
man explains that his men will com-
mute as the particular cases demand.
The State offices will be mainly infor-
mation and registration centres.

SAVING
AS WELL AS SELLING
OVERSEAS is vital to Australia
Associated Pulp and Paper Mills does both, and this
Australian-owned company is a large contributor to the economy and
prosperity of Australia.
In 1938, for the first time in the world, printing and writing
papers were produced at Burnie from short-fibred Eucalypt pulp.
Today, more than 3,000 people are producing some
100,000 tons annually to supply most of Australia’s requirements
in fine papers. There are “Burnie” and “Ballarat” papers
for personal stationery, Government usage, school exercise and
text books, printing, publishing and special wrapping.
This local production effects a very substantial saving in imports
and so conserves Australian overseas funds. To further assist
the nation’s trade balance, large tonnages of “Burnie” and
“Ballarat” papers are exported to South East Asia and other
foreign markets.
Constant quality control, intensive product research and the skill
of Australian workers ensure that the “Burnie” and “Ballarat” brands
rank as world-quality papers.

Wanted: iron ore projections
MINING • SHARE • LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON in Sydney
IF $2.50 IS TO BE the rule rather
than the exception in profit rates a ton
for the big iron ore contracts, then
Hamersley Iron’s prospectus may have
made things look a bit better for the
other companies involved in these major
developments. And with so many com-
panies now getting imo the iron ore
act, it is important for the market
to get some idea of just what is in
it for investors. Most companies have
done these projections of profit—they
would not have put their money up
otherwise. But shareholders know noth-
ing of them in most cases, even though
everything should be fairly simple to
work out provided costs are kept near
budget. For prices and export quan-
tities are both known for years in
advance.
This lack of knowledge not only
affects shareholders in companies like
BHP and CSR that have a large (even
though in CSR’s case substantially re-
duced) stake in big projects like Mt.
Newman; it also applies to those like
Ampol that have a small slice of the
Savage River scheme or McDonald In-
dustries with its 25 percent interest in
the modest-sized Frances Creek venture.
Most of the estimates on this page in
recent times about iron ore company
earnings have been based on the guess
that profits per ton would be around
the $2 mark after things settled down.
But if the Hamersley profit rate applied
to the Mt. Goldsworthy operation, Con-
solidated Goldfields’ share of 1967’s
three-million tons exports would be
worth about s2| million in profit alone,
compared with the profit estimate from
the whole group for the current
financial year of $4 million and last
year’s total profit of $2.9 million. So
on this basis (if it is right), the Gold-
fields profit in a few years should be
getting up around the $6 million mark
if its earnings from other sources (cop-
per, tin, coal, beach sands, and gold)
can be maintained. And the prospects
are that its tin earnings from Renison
will bound ahead.
But it seems reasonable for share-
holders to be told of the projections
on iron ore. At Mt. Newman the
economics of the affair are far from
clear yet, but the very volume of the
contracts suggests a healthy earning
rate. And when the ore exports from
this source reach the 6 million tons a
year mark, the chances are that CSR
will be raking in something like s2|
million in iron ore profits (depending,
of course, on its arrangements for re-
paying borrowings).
Shareholders in McDonald Industries
should not get too upset about the com-
panies’ problems with the Common-
wealth Railways over the state of the
track from the ore deposits at Frances
Creek to Darwin.
There is an urgent program of im-
provement to the line now under way
(in which McDonald is taking part and
so presumably keeping some of its work
force and equipment occupied) and it
should not be too long before the small
production now possible of only 2000 to
3000 tons of ore a week will be greatly
increased. This latest setback means
that McDonald’s market recovery is
simply being delayed a little, but it
will eventually come to light.
ANOTHER COMPANY whose shares
have fallen to bargain prices is island
trader Burns Philp. The 50-cent fall
from last year’s peak price around
$4.20 seems to be largely in sympathy
with the decline in earnings and market
price of its rival W. R. Carpenter. But
Burns Philp is not in the same boat as
Carpenter, as its interests are much
more concerned with trading and mer-
chandising over a wide area of Aus-
tralia and the islands, its plantation
activities are concentrated more on
copra and not spread into as yet unre-
warding centres, and its larger invest-
ment portfolio appears to be sounder
based.
Last year’s 9.4 percent profit rise was
despite the severe impact of drought
on its Australian operations, hurricane
damage in the islands, and generally
a decline in liquidity and purchasing
power. So this year’s profit should be
well and truly up, and no doubt the
new men at the top of Burns Philp will
soon wish to show they are at least as
good at making bonuses as their pre-
decessors, who paid out four bonuses
between 1958 and the most recent
one in 1964. These issues all took place
after Burns Philp’s earning rate reached
over the rate of 26 percent on capital.
Last year’s adjusted earning rate was
25.7 percent; this year’s is certain to
be over 26 percent.
The Chartist says:
INVESTORS certainly have not struck the “Jackpot” with NUTT & MUDDLE.
A 100 percent uptrend rate was followed from the official listing in June,
1965, until October of that year and, up to the time of the bonus issue, only
those investors who sold on the break of the upward trend would have avoided
considerable erosion of capital. A strong resistance level was established at 51c
after the bonus and the stock traded essentially in a rectangle formation with a
support level at 36c, which was penetrated in October, 1966, and prices declined
to a low of 28c. The normal “pullback” rally to the base of the rectangle followed
and the stock is once again deteriorating technically and decline to at least 22c
could be expected, where the situation would again cal or reassessment. Last
sales price on 7/4/67 —31 c.

FOR MEDIUM- TO long-term capital
growth and a reasonable income in the
meantime, Motels of Australia seems to
provide an excellent opportunity. The
shares have climbed six cents to 79
cents since the interim report was
released last month, but this price
should still leave a lot of room for
profits by investors who are not after
immediate gains. Yield from the 10 per-
cent dividend which will undoubtedly
be paid for the current year is 6.3 per-
cent.
Apart from the need to conserve
cash, directors must lend a .thought to
the day when the financial demands of
their expansion necessitate a cash issue
to shareholders. Although the majority
of the expansion will be financed by
borrowings and the proceeds of asset
sales to its new partner, it seems very-
likely that shareholders will be asked, at
some stage, to share in the development.
The capital gains advantages of such
issues are often lost if the issue is
coupled with a cut in dividend rate.
A cut is usually necessary if the payout
has been increased previously. Motels
directors will be precluding this possi-
bility by holding the payout at 10 per-
cent this year.
The group’s $2O million expansion
program with Britain’s largest hotel and
accommodation chain, Trust Houses,
will make it by far the largest accom-
modation chain in Australia. This will
place it in a prime position to take the
largest share of the phenomenal increase
in business which has been predicted for
tourism and the accommodation
industry over the next decade.
The deal with Trust Houses means
that the group is already getting on
with the necessary expansion. Five
motels and motor hotels are planned
in Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji,
with a total 1200 suites. This will boost
the company’s accommodation capacity
50 percent, although it must be remem-
bered that Trust Houses will be getting
half the profits from the new units. To
finance its part of the plans, Motels
sold four of its centres to the joint
partnership and has disposed of another
two elsewhere. The joint partnership
company is called T. H. Motels Ltd.
It has already embarked on the first
motel at Fiji (expanding as a tourist
centre) and another at Wellington
(N.Z.).
The amazing thing about Motels’
interim report was the growth recorded
in the December half despite the loss
of its full interests in some of its centres.
Profits were higher also despite a down-
turn in the results of the group’s build-
ing subsidiary. Another adverse factor
was what directors termed a sluggish
start, before the breaking of the drought
started to improve accommodation

figures. As the interim report revealed a
further distinct improvement in accom-
modation figures since January, it would
seem that the rate of profit growth
achieved in the first half will be bettered
in the second. It must also get an addi-
tional boost from the new TraveLodge
at Kings Cross. This did not open until
the end of November and will operate
for a full six months in the current
half.
So the company’s short-term outlook
is probably as bright as the long-term
prospect. Nevertheless, the substantial
growth which is promised in the longer
term should be the major factor in any
investment decision. The shares seem
ideal to buy, and sit on, for at least a
year, especially if one’s pocket is peri-
odically lightened by motel visits. The
profits which look like being made on
the market will soften such blows no
end.
COMMODORE MOTELS appears to
have plucked the fruits of an even
better half-year than Motels of Austra-
lia. It is doubtful that shares will still
be 70 cents by the time this issue of
THE BULLETIN reaches the streets.
However, should the strange quirks of
the share market keep them at, or re-
turn them to, this pre-interim-report
level, then a parcel may be well worth
acquiring. They have a slightly different
appeal from Motels of Australia, not the
least being the handsome seven percent
dividend yield on a 70-cent market
price, after brokerage.
There seems a chance of a dividend
increase from the group this year. Earn-
ing rate was 18.9 percent in 1965-66 and
dividend 10 percent. Profits in the latest
December half are reported to have
shown a good rise and the interim dis-
tribution will be held at five percent.
Directors have a stated policy of avoid-
ing share issues so that the group’s
rapid rate of expansion can be financed
by retained earnings, and borrowings
on the ever-increasing assets bought
with these earnings. Hence, if share-
holders are to receive any benefits at all
from the company’s growth, they must
come in the form of an increased
dividend.
The current year seems the most
likely for such an increase, as earnings
look like climbing to well over 20 per-
cent on capital. This will provide more
than double cover for the dividend, un-
less it is lifted. An increased dividend
could not help but raise the price of
the shares on the market. They are
already yielding this seven percent,
which is about as much as the market
usually lets a solid income-producer
offer. Perhaps they are worth buying
anywhere up to about the 75-cents level.
For the long-term investor, there is a
distinct possibility of takeover unless
the company does more for its share-
holders than pay 10 percent dividends.

Security analysis
Myers, with a leader’s yield
APART FROM GROUPING this sec-
tion of the retail leaders into variety
and department stores, one could also
group them as follows:
Group 1, G. J. Coles & Coy;
The Myer Emporium.
Group 2, David Jones; Waltons;
Woolworths.
It would then be found that this
grouping could indicate either the State
of incorporation or whether the com-
pany did or did not disclose its precise
sales figure. One has to say “precise,”
because Woolworths has disclosed an
approximate figure in the last three
years.
It would be very interesting to specu-
late why Victoria has been more en-
lightened than New South Wales in
this matter of the disclosure of total
sales by retailers. It could perhaps be
because the Myer Emporium Ltd. has
been the outstanding retailer in Aus-
tralia for some ti,me and feels that it
has nothing to lose by disclosing its
turnover to all its competitors. The
statistics show the growth that has
occurred over the past five years and
go some way to explaining why Myers’
shares are selling at fifteen times earn-
ings to show an immediate dividend
yield of only 2.8 percent:

Those who care to make some com-
parison between Myers and David
Jones may like to look back to last
week’s article and study the Tax per-
cent pretax profit and Depreciation
percent plant. These figures are repro-
duced below:
Tax % pretax profit 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
David Jones 39.1 37.5 43.1 42.1 40.9
Myers 43.0 43.0 45.6 45.6 44.7
Depreciation % plant
David Jones 15.1 9.8 10.2 10.3 10.1
15.8 16.1 15.1 14.2 15.1
Although it is quite impossible to be
certain, it looks as though Myers uses
a depreciation rate which is fifty percent
greater than that used by David Jones.
Perhaps in the final result this is not
terribly significant, because “plant” is
not a very large item in the total assets
of a retailer. But it may be as well to
point out that, if Myers had used the
same rate of depreciation as David
Jones, net profit after tax would have
been between 8J and 9 percent greater
over the last five years. There is a fair
chance that this “excess” depreciation
of Myers is not allowable for tax and
this is a possible explanation why the
tax provision is that much higher than
would seem necessary.
Apart from disclosing consolidated
sales, Myers also discloses the remun-
eration paid to its employees. In other
words, the amount of the major item
of cost is also given:
$ million
Year to July 31 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
Sales A 207.5228.72434266.5272.6
Remuneration B 31.9 35.0 36.3 39 5 42.9
B % A 15.4 15.3 14.9 14.8 15.7
Of course, it is only possible to guess
at the average gross margin which
Myers gets on its sales — that is, the
difference between the cost of sales and
the value of sales — but it could be
assumed that this does not differ much
from 30 percent. The actual margin
would vary quite considerably with the
type of goods. If this guess is right,
then salaries and wages would take
more than half of the gross margin and

would undoubtedly be the largest single
item of expense.
The basic wage increase will there-
fore be quite significant so far as
retailers generally are concerned and,
unless Myers achieves a much greater
increase in sales in 1966/67 than it
did in 1965/66, salaries and wages as
a percentage of sales will increase again
and probably result in another decline
in the percentage of trading revenue
to sales. The trend in this percentage
over the last five years has been:
Year to July 31 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
Trading revenue %
sales 8.8 8 7 9 5 9.9 9 3
Trading revenue in this sense means
net profit before tax, depreciation, and
interest, but excludes investment in-
come. It is probably a close approxima-
tion to net trading profit, although it
would include profit from the Myers
financing operation.
Over the last three years, the
deferred payments accounts of Myers
have been decreasing:
Year to July 31 1964 1965 1966
Gross amount $’000 20,435 18,832 16,983
Less Unearned income
interest 3,281 3,189 2,843
other 3,523 3,230 2,868
It seems likely that “Other” repre-
sents the profit on the sale on deferred
terms and that, contrary to the more
common practice, Myers does not take
in the retail profit until payment has
been received in full.
Myers is well established in every
State except Western Australia and
this gives rise from time to time to
speculation about the eventual entry
into that State. In the last chairman's
address, as a comment on the “peculiar
lethargy and unresponsiveness of con-
sumer de,mand,” it was stated: “. . . the
condition existed virtually throughout
Australia, though it seemed less appar-
ent, if no less real, in newer areas and
shopping centres.” This might well
mean that Myers will prefer to concen-
trate its energies in new shopping
centres in States where its name is well
known. The development of the South-
land Centre near Melbourne could be
an indication of this intention.
These developments are nevertheless
expensive in terms of pre-opening and
promotional expenses and it is very
satisfactory to read in the interim report
for 1966/7 that group net profit for the
half-year is up after absorbing these
expenses for Northlands and Burwood.
It looks as though the key to success
in retailing is in the expansion of sales,
since it is very difficult to control the
major cost. Certainly, it seems necessary
to achieve a greater increase than 2.3
percent per annum if profit is to con-
tinue to increase. Per share earnings
have increased very satisfactorily, while
sales have been increasing at about 8}
percent per annum on average. It must
be admitted that 1965/6 is complicated
by the issue of shares to acquire the
outstanding capital of Myers (S.A.).
It will therefore be extremely inter-
esting to study the increase in sales
and profits for 1966/7.

The spotlight was partly shared with an active BHP, which
on the week added 30 cents to finish at $6.70. Cyclone, on take-
over hints, put on 22 cents and closed at $1.70. Associated
Portland Cement, $l.OB, lost 7 cents, while A. & K. Cement
came back 3 cents to 98 cents. Vigorous miners included B. H.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
Conversation
piece from
way out West
ALL THE TALK around town this
week is of our biggest share float ever,
Hamersley Holdings. The iron ore
miner from out West is shortly coming
on to the Exchange lists at an all-time
record premium of 400 percent. Not
bad for a stock without an earnings
record! Australian shareholders are be-
ing asked, and in fact are falling over
each other, to take up the 10 million
available shares at $2.50 apiece. On a
par value basis this is exactly double
the float-off price of the other “excite-
ment” stock of recent months, Con-
solidated Goldfields. The latter com-
pany’s shares rocketed to $4 immedi-
ately they hit the market. I don’t think
Hamersley will be quite as dramatic
or as profitable in its floor debut, but
can still see a healthy margin for those
fortunate enough to be able to get a
parcel.
Hamersley’s charm for the market
lies in its big plans for the future.
Directors say they will get sales up
from the meagre 724,000 tons of 1966
to 4.8 million in 1967 and then pro-
gressively to 10 million tons by 1972.
They estimate that profit will be 22
cents a 50 cent share by 1970 and
that a maiden dividend of 15 cents a
share will be paid in the same year.
Nice work, if you can get it!
A stock I have been watching with
interest over the past few months is
Containers. Since January it has risen
20 cents to $l.BO. As the largest manu-
facturer of metal containers in Aus-
tralia, it is doing really well out of the
rapidly growing demand for soft-drink
cans. Just take a look at the ever-
increasing number' of these that are
appearing in supermarkets, cafes, and
even service stations. In addition, the
company has recently reorganised its
management and rationalised its fac-
tories. It has also built a new factory
to handle all canning requirements of
the Heinz group. I bought 200 at the
$l.BO price.
Incidentally, while talking about food
companies, I noticed that Mrs. Jones,
despite all her bickering with Daisy,
was able to earn higher profits for Mar-
rickville Margarine in the first half of
the year. What is more, the chairman
has said he expects profits for the full
year will be better than last year’s
effort. On this basis I have made a note
on my calendar to have another look
at this company a week or so before


Don’t

■ You’re a success today because you had sufficient
foresight to recognise your opportunity, the courage to

that the advice and assistance given to you by a Free
Enterprise Bank has been valuable in translating initia-
tive into success. There is scarcely an item we eat, wear,
drive, use, or live in that does not benefit in some way
from the resources which the banks maintain. Success
is no matter of luck. It is invariably the product of
co-operation between competitive banks and competitive
people.

I had been toying with the idea of
buying some Coal & Allied ever since
I heard that America is having trouble
keeping up with its coal supplies to
Japan. This is because its own steel in-
dustry and those in Europe are step-
ping up production and are taking
more of its coal than in the past. As
Australia is the second largest supplier
of coal to Japan, it is the logical place
for the Japanese to turn to with their
order books. Coal & Allied will benefit
here. The company is also doing well
from the new power stations which have
lately been built, and are being built,
right next door to its mines in northern
New South Wales.
Thiess is another coal miner which
will do well from its exports to Japan.
However, some investors are still wary
of this company because of its con-
tractual engineering division. They
remember the heavy losses this division
incurred a few years ago.

When Alcan puts ideas into aluminium,
a Land Rover operator can carry an extra 2cwt.
Vehicle: 109" wheelbase Land Rover.
Examine the facts: increased payload 10%. The result of replacing a
wood and steel tray with Alcan aluminium Plank-flor. Plank-flor tray
measures 7' x 5'6" (includes headboard, rope rail and mudguards). Legal
gross weight: 2 ton 13 cwt. Complete Plank-flor weight: 3i cwt.
Payload 1 ton 2i cwt. Payload up: 2 cwt.
The Land Rover* illustrated above is fitted with Plank-flor—a system
for manufacturing tray bodies. It is made up of a set of high strength
aluminium interlocking sections. It is ideal for all sizes of tray bodies.
Plank-flor is tough, it lasts longer than conventional materials and
eliminates re-flooring. Plank-flor never rusts, rots or warps. Never needs
protective painting. Stays clean . . . and efficient. Operators can save on
registration, third party and road tax. Empty vehicles save on tyres, fuel
and maintenance, because there's no heavy tray dragging behind.
•Land Rovers are manufactured in Australia by: Pressed Metal Corporation Limited, Cosgrove Road,
Enfield. Incidentally, the Land Rover cab illustrated above is also constructed from aluminium.

Prospects of luck for
Metals Exploration
THERE ARE FEW companies on
Stock Exchange lists which have been
as unlucky as Metals Exploration N.L.
Over recent years one after another of
the company’s investments has proved
disappointing and shareholders have
seen the value of their shares fall from
a peak of 102 cents early in 1964 to
levels of around 32 cents in recent
weeks. These investments have included
Westernport Sand Pty. Ltd., Barrier
Exploration N.L., Greenbushes Tin
N.L., and the Leisner mine at Wolfram
Camp in Northern Queensland.
In 1961 the company began testing
the wolfram - bismuth - molybdenite
deposits at Wolfram Camp. These
deposits were worked extensively
earlier this century, and before 1920
Australia was the principal producer of
molybdenite, much of it from the work-
ings at Wolfram Camp. Since testing
began the company has developed and
rehabilitated the mine considerably and
discovered several new pipes of mineral.
However, no information giving details
of ore reserves has ever been announced,
the company being satisfied with figures
relating to the amount of ore extracted
during development. Development came
to a disappointing conclusion last year
when it was found that the ore structure
was rapidly disappearing at depth.
This mine is now being put into pro-
duction on a salvage basis. In October,
1965, the directors anticipated a profit-
able operation for some time to come
from this source, but in the 1966 ac-
counts they considered it prudent to
make a provision of $250,000 to write
off part of the exploration costs involved
in locating ore before mining com-
menced. By December last year the
company was extracting ore for stock-
piling, and design of a treatment plant
was undertaken. Production of wolfram
and molybdenite concentrates was ex-
pected to commence by the middle of
1967 and yield a substantial surplus
after paying for the treatment plant and
mining and treatment costs. The total
investment by the group in locating
quartz pipes containing the high-grade
ore was almost $400,000 at Tune 30,
1966.
As the company has provided
$250,000 for the exploration costs, it
appears likely that its share of this 50
percent venture will be to the order of
$150,000.
Westernport Sand Pty. Ltd., in which
a 25 percent interest was acquired in
1964, was subjected to test boring to
prove reserves which contained two
nfillion cubic yards of concrete sand
and six million cubic yards of glass
sand, but by 1965 the company had
found the market for these products
limited and deferred further action.
Late in 1964 the company took up a
12|- percent interest in Barrier Explora-
tion N.L., which was formed to deep-
drill a lease at Broken Hill in an effort
to prove the extension of the existing
lead/zinc ore structure. Drilling to
date by this company has established
an extension of the ore structure, but
of insufficient grade to be exploited,
and the current drill hole is just below
target depth. Should this drill fail to
find substantial intersections of eco-
nomic grades, the company would have
a very uncertain life.
Another unlucky investment is the
company’s 19| percent interest in
Greenbushes Tin N.L., which was
floated in August, 1964. Dredging was
commenced at the company’s alluvial
tin and tantalite area in Western Aus-
tralia in September, 1965, and in Janu-
ary, 1966, the company’s dredge found-
ered. After recommencing dredging
operations during March, Greenbushes
has encountered problems in achieving
prospectus throughputs due to the clay
content of ground dredged. After a
large loss last year and a small deficit
for the first half of this year, the com-
pany is now operating profitably, but
operations seem unlikely ever to pro-
duce worth-while returns.
Extensive quantities of clay were also
responsible, together with lack of water,
for the failure of the alluvial tin-
washing operation at Tingha, in N.S.W.,
undertaken by Australian Placer N.L.,
in which the Metals Exploration group
had a 38 percent interest on its forma-
tion in 1963. These problems caused the
closure of the plant eight months after
operations commenced in 1964. On the
closure of this plant the company ac-
quired the balance of Australian Placer’s
capital and re-established operations on
leases at Stannum, in the New England
district. This operation has run well
from its inception, producing tin con-
centrates at the rate of 200 tons per
annum, and in its first six months’ oper-
ations an operating surplus of about
$BO,OOO was earned. Reserves at this
deposit are sufficient for the next three
years’ operations and the company is
fortunate in that, as mining progresses,
less overburden will need to be re-
moved and profitability should increase.
Experience gained from this operation
should stand the company in good stead
when it begins another alluvial tin oper-
ation in June. This deposit is at Ruxton,
in North Queensland, and it is planned
to produce 120 tons of tin concentrates
per year.
The combination of profits from Stan-
num and Ruxton, together with the
surplus expected from Wolfram Camp,
should allow the company to turn in
quite a respectable profit next financial
year, while during the current year a
small operating profit should also be
earned before taking into account lease
amortisation and exploration costs writ-
ten off. During the current year the
company will also be bringing to ac-
count a capital profit of $508,000 from
the sale of its 2,325,566 shares in Cleve-
land Tin N.L. In addition, the com-
pany’s share of the proceeds of sale of
leases and other property by the Aber-
foyle Tin development partnership to
Cleveland Tin N.L. was $269,000.
Some newer prospects should not be
discounted too severely, as success in
one would certainly offset - failure -of
others. It is to be hoped that share-
holders and investors will be able to
gauge the current prospects of the com-
pany by announcements in regard to the
results of drilling the Greenvale nickel
deposit, for example. With a capital of
only $2,141,603 contained in 5,991,700
shares, there is plenty of scope for
appreciation from the current level of
35 cents should one of the company’s
larger ventures prove worth while.
Commodities
Joint action from
copper miners?
WITH THE RHODESIAN stalemate
and the possibility of strike action by
U.S. mineworkers in mid-year the only
bullish elements left in the copper mar-
ket, talk of producer marketing co-
operation grows. Copper prices had
come back £stg.Bo a ton in two months
by last week. The £3BO a ton price
then prevailing was about half the
peak not a year ago. But it was still
£l5O above the extended market
plateau held by producers up to the end
of 1963.
So it isn’t quite kicking a market
while it’s down to point to the accelera-
tion of the return to a better supply
position in the U.S. Mounting U.S. de-
mand has been the prime basic factor
holding up prices ever since the Chilean
strikes ended last year. Without this the
Zambian alarums would not have been
of such concern.
The amount of extra copper required
by U.S. fabricators to meet working
stocks and unfilled contracts fell from
74,000 tons in January to 31,000 tons
in February. A much lower level of out-

standing orders appears to be the rea-
son for the improvement as yet,
supplies of metal have not gained by
much. If the trend continued this
month there could be an American sur-
plus for the first time for three years.
During copper’s wild flight of the
past three years, several tentative moves
were made by Chilean and Zambian
Mines Ministers to co-ordinate prices.
Although these failed, there have been
renewed efforts at co-operation in the
face of the less encouraging recent mar-
ket trends.
As there is likely to be considerable
surplus capacity in these two countries
they are the top exporters of copper,
although the U.S. is the largest miner
it will largely be up to them to
control the market. There is reason for
scepticism, on past performance alone.
But the Frei Government in Chile
has shown an enlightened attitude on
many of the country’s problems, and
it may be able to bring itself to volun-
tarily forgo some vital foreign ex-
change in the short-term in the hope of
doing better in the long run. Certainly,
signs of some joint action from these
and other producers will be a factor
in the market in coming years.
THERE HAS BEEN a resurgence of
price weakness in the U.S. aluminium
markets. Despite the outwardly united
front of a uniform 25 U.S. cents a lb.
price, the U.S. industry has never over-
come the discounting which first began
during the bad days of the late 19505.
Then, over-expansion led to cuts in
the official price and even larger cuts
in the prices at which most sales were
actually made.
Aluminium leaders protest that all is
still well and point out that the industry
is so large today that a fundamental
imbalance between supply and demand
would neither be so harmful nor so
long-lived as in the 19505.
Like copper, though not to the same
extent, aluminium has met quieter de-
mand this year. Last year’s boom has
been followed by a March quarter in
which producers expect little growth
over the first quarter last year. The
increases in semi-fabricated product
prices in January have evidently not
“taken.”
Alcoa in January had stressed the
need for more strength in the semi s
field, where margins were still felt to
be too low. The industry giant made
only a |-cent lift in metal prices
(against the general wish for a 1-cent
lift) and raised semi-fabricated prices
1 cent.
Both the primary and mill-products
prices are now thought to be back to
last year’s published prices in some
sales. Meanwhile, production of ingot
continued to rise strongly in January,
gaining 7 percent over January, 1966,
levels.

The file on William Faulkner
By H. P. HESELTINE
The Faulkner-Cowley File. Malcolm
Cowley. $5.15.
Essay, Speeches, and Public Letters.
William Faulkner. Edited by James
B. Meriwether. $4.25, both Chatto
and Windus.
“THE FAULKNER-COWLEY FILE”
is the record of a correspondence be-
tween the novelist and Malcolm Cowley,
initiated when the latter was preparing
the Viking Portable Faulkner and con-
tinued spasmodically until 1962. The
book concludes with a chapter of criti-
cal co,mment and makes use of some
narrative continuity, but, in the main,
Cowley is content to let the letters speak
for themselves.
“The Faulkner-Cowley File” is
presented as a dossier. The letters have
great fascination. They testify, for
instance, to the practical value of a
lively and sympathetic literary criti-
cism. When Cowley started to prepare
the “Portable Faulkner,” the novelist
was scarcely read or acknowledged in
his own country outside a small band of
fellow writers. The appearance in 1946
of this integrated selection of his fiction
can be seen in retrospect as a land-
mark in his history of Faulkner’s repu-
tation; never again would he be ignored
by either critics or book-buying public.
In the course of this high-level pro-
motion campaign, both men naturally
revealed something of themselves to
each other. The lot of the writer was,
n a sense, the easier. He could defend
his integrity by retreating into his
vriter’s pride. Cowley, on the other
hand, sometimes seems to have found
himself in an uneasy dilemma: want-
ing desperately, in his role as literary
critic, fairly to serve the great writer
he had discovered, but tempted sorely,
in his capacity as literary journalist, to
make use of a hot property. The con-
flict of interest is nowhere plainer than
in the episode of the projected article
on Faulkner for “Life” magazine. At
one .moment the paid professional is
talking: “Messrs. Life & Co. would
stake me to a trip to Mississippi and I
vould love to see you there, and they
vould pay a large sum for the article,
something I could use right now and
leel happy about.” The next, it is the
servant of literature sorrowing over the
inevitable invasion of Faulkner’s privacy
by some other and less responsible
writer: “Some time ‘Life’ or another
magazine I can prophesy is going
to send a reporter to Oxford with in-
structions to get a story, and he’ll do
the job unscrupulously. That’s the
trouble with your decision it’s abso-
lute for anyone who respects you and
admires your work, but won’t have any
effect at all on the sons of bitches.”
The profile was, in fact, written
(though not by Cowley), and published
in “Life.” Cowley’s role in the entire
episode can tell us a great deal about
the kind of moral minefield that any
responsible .middleman of literature
may have to negotiate in the modern
world. But the incident is finally more
interesting for the light that it casts on
Faulkner. No American writer has
entertained a greater passion for
privacy. The intense secrecy in which
he strove to envelop himself may have
had in it some elements of neurotic
role playing. There was the omnipresent
British officer’s trench coat, for instance,
or the pretence (sometimes adopted in
correspondence) of being a naive Mis-
sissippi dirt farmer. There was the
dedication to hunting, the running of
bootleg liquor, and, most improbably,
the two-year career as Scoutmaster. But
there was more to it than that. “It is
my ambition,” he once wrote to Cow-
ley, “to be, as a private individual,
abolished and voided from history, leav-
ing it ,markless, no refuse save the
printed books.”
In those words can be heard the true
tones of the Joycean artist, desiring to
remain within or behind or beyond or
above his handiwork, invisible, refined
out of existence. The need for anony-
mity was, as Cowley shrewdly points
out in his last chapter, an essential
ingredient of Faulkner’s greatness. It
was as if he needed privacy to allow
his energy and experience to sink deep
into the stir of his subconscious mind,
finally to emerge as the epic of Yokna-
patawpha county. “The Faulkner-
Cowley File” hints again and again
at just how much of the fiction came
from those deep pools of barely con-
scious creation which seem peculiarly
the property of genius. It tells, for
instance, of Faulkner’s capacity to recall
details of his fiction, quite apart from
any text, and years after the original
composition. It records his repeated
assertion that all he was doing was tell-
ing stories, retelling them, and trying
to get them right. It reveals the
essential quality of his imagination in
his recipe for novel-writing: “You have
William Faulkner
to take chances and get, it down good
or bad.”
Yet the very success of Cowley’s
promotional efforts mean that Faulkner
would no longer be left free just to tell
his stories, to get it all down as best he
could. He was forced to face up to the
demands of fame. The measure of his
response is taken in Ja,mes B. Meri-
wether’s collection of essays, speeches,
and public letters. The volume, includ-
ing such famous pieces as the Nobel
Prize Acceptance Speech and the Letter
to a Northern Editor, covers a wide
range of subjects: notably integration,
the place of the South in America and
America in the world, the function of
the writer. They have one thing in
common the famous style, complete
with all the key words, the recognisable
tricks of syntax. Nearly all the prose
in this book dates from the early or
middle 19505, and it is tempting to
see the heightened rhetoric of the later
Faulkner as, in part at least, a projec-
tion of his public status as celebrated
author. Yet the germ of that style is
to be found not even in the early
fiction (Cowley had identified it:
Faulkner had admitted possible flaws)
but in the very experience of his
adolescence. In his Foreword to “The
Faulkner Reader” (1954) he recalled a
book he had read when he was about
sixteen. Its Polish author, Henryk Sien-
kewiecz, had recorded in his preface
that his novel was “written in travail for
the uplifting of men’s hearts.” So early
were planted the seeds not only of the
resounding phrases of the Nobel Prize
speech but the fictional purposes of a
lifetime.
These speeches, essays, and public
letters, then, catch Faulkner’s style
fully developed and put to the purposes
of public morality. But the morality as


much as the style is the product of a
whole career. The notorious and often
misinterpreted attitude toward integra-
tion; the pleas for the betterment of
the Mississippi education system; even
the comments on the Suez crisis and
the captured U-2 pilot, Gary Powers;
these were not the manufactured
opinions of the moment. They grew out
of everything that Faulkner had experi-
enced and known.
Colette by Colette
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Earthly Paradise. Colette. Seeker &
Warburg. $5.65.
THIS IS “COLETTE” by Colette: the
autobiography she never wrote. In-
geniously made up of long excerpts
from her own enormous output, three-
quarters of which has not appeared in
an English translation before and
cleverly put together by Robert Phelps
to cover her whole eventful life, it
Succeeds in giving a sanely rounded
portrait not only of the person and
the myth but also in showing exactly
how the two overlap into legend.
For once it is possible wholeheartedly
to agree with a blurb: it dares to place
Colette next to Proust. The 30,000-
word excerpt from “Le Pur et l’impur”
(originally entitled “Ces Plaisirs”)
would alone be enough to substantiate
this claim. Colette herself, whose
highly developed critical faculty was
always turned upon her own writing
as well as on others, has, I feel, cor-
rectly assessed it: “Perhaps some day
this will be seen to be my best book.” It
is about time the whole work appeared
in English. It was published in France
in 1932 and predates many other female
writers’ clinical studies of sex.
The realms of Colette’s sexuality
seem to have recognised no boundaries.
She writes not only of what she her-
self calls “Sodom and Gomorrah” but
of all the graded country in between.
Her own bisexual nature seems to have
attracted her both to men and women
and resulted in several marriages, a
daughter, and some lesbian involve-
ments. “The Impure” of the title does
not, of course, refer to homosexuality
in any of its forms but rather to what
exists in the minds of many people.
In excerpts from “Mes Apprentis-
sages” she unmasks at length the
literary confidence trick played by her
first husband: “Monsieur Willy” forced
her into ghost-writing for him and
claimed for years that he was the
author and Colette merely the model
for her Claudine. It seems quite in
keeping with the character of such a
man that before their divorce he had
sold all rights over her head so that
financially she never received anything
for these best-sellers.
Portion of the trick was acting the
part in public, and a teenaged Jean
Cocteau remembers seeing them “on
show” in Paris, “Willy, Colette, and
her bulldog: Willy with his walrus
moustache and goatee, his heavy eyelids
and flowing tie, his wide-brimmed top
hat and his bishop’s hands clasped on
the knob of his cane, and beside him
Colette ... a thin, thin Colette, a sort
of miniature fox in cycling dress . . .”
Colette rather liked being called a fox.
It probably appealed to her strong
pantheistic streak, her creed that looked
for and found true innocence and
purity only through the eyes of animals
and children.
Throughout this selection of writing,
which covers her Burgundian birth as
Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette in 1873 right
up to her death in Paris 81 years later,
it is her acute joy of living, her senses
constantly stimulated by everything
around her, whether birds, animals,
food, or simply the shape of clouds pass-
ing across her window, that shouts
triumphantly from every line, and
which not even the pains of severe
arthritis could stifle.
Parasite
By EUGENE KAMENKA
Post-War Years 1945-1954. Ilya Ehren-
burg. Translated from the Russian
by Tatiana Shebunina and Yvonne
Kapp. Mac Gibbon & Kee. $8.90.
ILYA EHRENBURG, for nearly thirty
years a roving Soviet cultural ambas-
sador abroad, has never had the respect
of intelligent people either inside or
outside the Soviet Union. Once an
entertaining but second-rate novelist,
Ehrenburg has become or perhaps
has always been a journalist in all
the worst senses of that word. He is an
intellectual parasite, always living on
borrowed capital, dropping shallow
ideas and great names with equal
facility. He transports the mentality of
the afternoon Press into literature, sub-
stituting “human interest” for principles
and sentimentality for critical judg-
ment. Dotted through the pages of
Ehrenburg’s works are the true writers
tortured by Soviet life. Some com-
mitted suicide; some were killed; some
tried to live as internal emigres. Ehren-
burg can only shine in the reflected
glory of having known them. He chat-
ters while they suffer.
The outstanding thing about Ehren-
burg is that he has lived through forty
years of horror piled on horror, and
that he has never known one moment’s
spiritual agony strong enough to show
itself in his work. Whatever field
Ehrenburg belongs to, it is not that of
literature. He has the mentality of a
commercial salesman a fund of
stories, a respect for the things his
patrons respect, and a certain ability to
predict the trend of taste.
Ehrenburg is now old, over 75, and
it is not clear whether his role as a
“liberal” in the Soviet Union today is
based on his estimate of the market or
on the feeling that it is time he tried
to leave a better impression behind
him. Certainly it was he who came out,
from 1953 onward, as a champion of
sincerity and technical skill as part
of the author’s craft. It was Ehren-
burg’s novel “The Thaw,” published
in 1954, with its unflattering portrayal
of conditions in Soviet intellectual life,
that gave the new Soviet movement to-
ward intellectual liberalisation its
name.
Since then Ehrenburg has been pub*
lishing his long autobiography, of which
“Post-War Years” is the sixth and final
volume. It has taken us through his
childhood and youth in pre-revolution-
ary Russia, the first years of the revolu-
tion, the period of “truce,” 1921-33,
which Ehrenburg spent mostly abroad,
and the Nazi era and the war. In this
final volume he turns to the early post-
war years the period of peace con-
gresses and the cold war, of the new
Stalinist purges and the campaign
against Jewish cosmopolitans.
Personally I found this volume, like
all the preceding volumes, profoundly
irritating in its glib pretence of frank-
ness and sincerity and its continuing
underlying dishonesty. Ehrenburg
always tells enough to make himself a
champion of the anti-Stalinist spirit and
never enough to discuss problems
honestly or to put his present political
position into serious question. One
would like to feel that he is just
muddled or confused. But his words are
chosen with too much care; dangerous
questions are raised and dropped at just
the right moment, the protestations of
ultimate loyalty to the revolution are
always made at precisely that point
where the censors might otherwise have
got restive. To the skills of journalism,
Ehrenbrug has added the skills of
diplomacy. Both have destroyed him as
a writer.
No doubt, those with a detailed inter-
est in personalities and events in the
Soviet Union and in the Peace Con-
gresses of the early 1950 s will find
occasional grist for their mill in Ehren-
burg’s pages. He writes about his con-
versations with Bernal and Joliot-Curie,
he gives his younger Soviet readers
what they want by recalling the indig-
nities to which Pasternak and Akhma-
tova were subjected; he talks of the
Army purges and of the campaign
against Jews in Soviet theatre criticism.
But all the time he plays the particu-
larly nasty game that Soviet conditions
have long encouraged: he twists every-
thing into a personal issue, evil as well
as good; he ignores the death of mil-
lions in order to write about the death
of one and so make it seem compara-
tively exceptional.
If Soviet writers constantly stick to
the personal, this is not because they
have a deeper feeling for the individual,
but because they cannot afford to treat

Spies in aspic
By JOHN BAXTER
The Night Is A Time For Listening.
Elliot West. Gollancz. $2.65.
The Man In The Glass Booth. Robert
Shaw. Chatto and Windus. $2.65.
FROM THE FIRST three lines, one
knows what sort of book “The Night
Is A Time For Listening” will be. “He
had been told to stand at 3 p.m. in the
entrance to Breite Strasse facing Marx-
Engels Platz, where a taxi would pick
him up. Not just any taxi—a very
special one, whose driver wouldn’t need
to be given instructions but merely
told: ‘My face is frozen stiff.’ ” We
are back in the Le Carre-like world of
the “real” spice, a place where the
hitherto glamorous profession of
espionage is shown to be as devoid of
interest as the wholesale grocery trade
and just about as profitable.
Those who read spy stories regularly
will be able to fill in the rest almost
without thinking. There will be a
secret which everybody from the
Albanians down is looking for, a bitter
girl who sells her dubious virtue for a
carton of cigarettes (one gets the
impression that, in post-war Berlin,
everybody was a chain smoker), a dis-
enchanted spy who is eventually be-
trayed and destroyed by an impersonal
higher authority.
The predictability, however, does not
make stories of this kind any harder
to read, and Mr. West deals the
familiar cards with considerable skill
and originality. He has, too, his ace
in the hole, a hero whose particular
skill (a memory capable of total recall)
makes him more than usually interest-
ing. It is not hard to believe that the
Russians would approach such a man
to “record” and bring back the infor-
mation supplied to him by a traitor
British scientist, or that he would accept
the offer in return for the right to
revenge himself on the Nazi who
murdered his wife and is now working
for the Russians.
In retrospect, it is easy to see “The
Night Is A Time For Listening” and
its kind as literary confidence tricks.
One starts with a relatively simple
premise a love affair, in this case,
between a spy and the wife of his con-
tact and works back from it, compli-
cating and confusing the story line until
one reaches what seems like a promising
beginning. A plot line which, run back-

wards, seems transparent, will, read
from the beginning, appear engagingly
complex, and the final denouement will
have more than usual impact because
of its seemingly inevitability.
This system is good enough for spy
stories, but one would not imagine that
it could be adapted to a serious novel
where, in theory at least, action springs
from character and not from the neces-
sity for a sock ending. Mr. Shaw’s
book is, however, remarkably similar
to “The Night Is A Time For Listen-
ing” in its structure, differing only in
that Shaw brings to the rather tired
mechanics of this plot an alert and in-
genious talent.
Arthur Goldman is a New York real
estate tycoon, old, perhaps senile, but
still controlling an empire of skyscrapers
and developments. Crossing the road
outside his hotel one evening with his
secretary, Charlie Cohn, he sees a man
he claims to recognise as “Dorff.”
Though terrified, he refuses to discuss
the man or his significance, and from
then on his mind begins quickly to
collapse. He wanders dazed around a
frozen park at midnight, then stumbles
home to claim that he has been beaten
by Dorff. Cohn is suspicious, but it is
not until he returns one night to Gold-
man’s mansion and finds his employer
dressed in the uniform of the SS that
he begins to suspect that Goldman may
himself be Dorff, a Nazi renegade mas-
querading as a rich Jew.
This is only half the story, but the-
rest is so surprising that the reader
should experience it for himself. Shaw
enjoys ringing the changes on old
cliches, alternately parodying and ana-
lysing such institutions as custom tailors
and charity parties. The Israeli under-
ground is sent up with hilarious atten-
tion to detail, and the incongruity of a
persecuted nation itself becotning a
persecutor is ruthlessly exposed.
Through it all walks Goldman, a dazed,
dying old man searching for peace or
fulfilment, or perhaps both.
In “The Sun Doctor,” Shaw showed
himself as the most personal of stylists,
a description which seems even more
appropriate after this magnificently tex-
tured novel. Shifting with ease from
internal monologue and broken, frag-
mented conversation to the complex
construction of background, he is at all
times in complete control of his
material. The chapter on Goldman’s
gala, attended only by himself and a
score of beautiful, rich women, is as
richly colored as a historical romance,
though informed with the feeling for
detail that few writers since F. Scott
Fitzgerald have been able to handle
with ease. The party scene is, in fact,
reminiscent of that in “The Great
Gatsby,” though without the romanti-
cism that Fitzgerald could never
exclude totally from his work. If we-
are to have thrillers, let us by all means
include in our list Mr. West’s involuted
conundrum. But the top .must be
reserved for books like “The Man In
The Glass Booth.”

Seeds of discontent
THE BULLETIN’S Western Australian
correspondent has made the following-
reply to six points raised in Professor
Underwood’s letter (8., April 1) about
Uniwager.
(i) The originally announced agree-
ment with Lielders would have re-
stricted University “absolute freedom
of action” by precluding bulk produc-
tion or marketing of the University’s
own varieties “unless after consultation
with the company.” This may be among
the sections which Professor Underwood
told the W.A. Larmers’ Union had been
amended after pressure from public
reaction and the Press.
(ii) The Trustees referred to are
those of the Soil Lertility Lund, who
officially knew nothing of the deal
before the seed was in India. The
Larmers’ Union general executive was
told only in strict confidence, stifling-
debate and the chance of competition.
(iii) The strongest protests have
come not from farmers kept in the
dark but from professional agricultur-
ists closest to the deal and certainly
“sufficiently acquainted with the actual
facts.”
(iv) Exploitation for three years is
prevented over Uniwager; no such
guarantee has been revealed for the
most lucrative aspect of the contract—
the Uniwager cross-breds Lielders will
have access to.
(v) As involved as it has become with
the company, the University cannot so
glibly wash its hands of responsibility
over the Esperance Plain aspect of the
deal.
(vi) While farmers may not disagree
with Professor Underwood’s concept
of University-private enterprise co-
operation, they would demand the first
prerequisite of free enterprise com-
petition. Despite talk of Lielders’
‘“initiative,” there was no competition.
The company has been secretly handed
a bonanza on a plate.
Olympic twilight
It is a pity that your sports column,
which had been closed for repairs
for two years, had to be revived with
such a gloomy piece as “Discus’ ”
doomsday message for the Olympics
(8., March 11). He writes about the
“twilight” of the Games and one should
be grateful that he doesn’t add the
Gotterdammerung for good measure.
It is true that the growing size of
the Olympic Games is causing some
headaches to the organisers. However,
it’s not the increasing number of
athletes that make the Games a big
financial gamble but the residual greed
of the host city.
Consequently, I doubt if it is true
that only the richest cities or countries
can afford to stage an Olympics. Hel-
sinki in 1952 proved that it is possible
to hold the Games for a modest
financial outlay, without ruining your
economy. And those Games, from a
purely sporting viewpoint, were much
closer to the Olympic ideal than the
Rome or Tokyo Games.
However, there is more to the
“Discus”-prophesied twilight than
meets the eye. He advocates that
“amateur sport would be much better
served if the individual sports each
held their own world championships,
yearly, in a chosen city . . .”
I hope it doesn’t come as a complete
surprise to him that this is being done
on a vast scale. Last year separate
world championships were held in 15
Olympic sports, each quite indepen-
dently, at a different venue.
Alas, Australia competed only in a
handful of these. In fact, the appear-
ance of Australians at world champion-
ships has always been a rare and plea-
santly surprising occasion. So it’s not so
much that the world fails to respond
to modern ideas but that Australia
remains hopelessly isolated. These
world championships, by the way, are
not replacing the Olympics, merely
supplementing them.
The truth is, no matter how painful
it may be to swallow, that while most
other countries recognise the immense
value of international sport, in Austra-
lia it remains a pastime tolerated by
the Government and blessed with an
incredibly archaic organisation.

COTOM
Some time Ameriyiajr' Tress
photographers easedup' on what the
cognoscenti call “COTOM.” But this
unfortunately still persists in the other-
wise excellent work of our Australian
artists. We can see evidence of this in
nearly every issue of THE BULLETIN.
Lor the sake of the unlearned, I may
need to explain that COTOM is the
Cult Of The Open Mouth. It was
originally based on the incorrect sup-
position that back teeth or the epiglot-
tis are among the most attractive
portions of the human anatomy.
In the most recent BULLETIN
the following seem to be victims of
COTOM: a Saint in a stained-glass
window, Mr. Robert Morley, our Prime
Minister, an American officer in Viet-
nam talking to the Prime Minister,
that charming actress Miss Bette Davis,
and an Italian gentleman explaining-
why he does not watch a certain TV
channel.
It is possible that a photographer
might find it hard to take a non-
COTOM photograph of the cinema
actor, and the American soldier was
perhaps just swearing. The picture of
the actor was a drawing, and the actress
was photographed, a little unkindly.
In the issue of March 11, I find the
following COTOM pictures: Mr. Suk-
arno and Hitler (serve them right!),
Senator Gorton, an Indonesian student
at a microphone, a fellow-member of
the cloth in a cartoon, and a man in an
advertisement falling from a great
height.

Migrants
Re the article “Migrants” (8., March
4), the term “white Anglo-Saxon Pro-
testant” reeks of religious bigotry and
intolerance, and of the narrowest and
most obnoxious type of racialism.
The Anglo-Saxon myth was largely
the offspring of the imperialistic move-
ment in the late 19th century.
Modern U.K. writers, being more
realistic and better informed, do not
seem to be at all keen on perpetuating
“White Protestant Anglo-Saxonism.”

Kit Courses
I have to point out a serious inaccuracy
in your article (8., April 8) about Syd-
ney University Adult Education De-
partment’s Kit Courses.
The Department does not intend to
terminate its Kit Courses.
These were begun as an experiment
in the method of Adult Education, but
the Department has never regarded
them as an activity providing Uni-
versity-type Adult Education, and it
has always been ready to transfer them
to some other appropriate body. But,
since they have proved so popular and
are highly valued by so many people, we
intend to continue them until successful
transfer is possible. This remains our
policy.

Education, University of Sydney.
