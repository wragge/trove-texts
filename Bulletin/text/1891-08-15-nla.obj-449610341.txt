BUCKINGHAM PARK ESTATE,
MEDLOW (Blue Mountains).
This charming Estate has its Railway Platform air OSt
adjoining, and its level land proves it to be emine tly
adapted for residential purposes. Nature seems to h. ve
lavished all her varied charms on BUCKINGHAM PAI R,
which is, without exception, the CREAM or PICKKu
SPOT on the BLUE MOUNTAINS.
BUCKINGHAM PARK ESTATE
Is beautifully surveyed. The Allotments are unusually
large-from 100 Up to 180 feet frontages, with long depths
—thus enabling buyers to have Garden, Tennis Lawns,
etc., if they so desire. In fact, it may be truly said, there
is no finer Residential Land on the Mountains.
The BELGRAVIA HOTEL, MEDLOW, which cost £4OOO,
is now open for visitors, and is the First Hotel on the
Mountains supplied with the Electric Light, and the
Proprietor is willing to supply any cottages built on the
estate with the electric light. Two elegant Villas are
now nearly finished on this estate. The rapid advance in
the price of land at BLACKHEATH during the past three
years, amounting to fully 300 per cent., clearly shows that
early buyers at Buckingham Park will make a splendid
investment. Title is TORRENS, and the terms are liberal
and to suit buyers. For particulars, apply to the Pro-

cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending

The Co-Operative
SYSTEM, the nearest approach to Socialism that can be achieved under the
present conditions of life, has met with phenomenal success wherever it has
been applied to any object. In England, even the Co-operative Societies
benefit some millions of persons—their membership exceeding a million and
a-half, and hold invested capital to the amount of eleven millions of money.
This success is owing to the fact that the investor sees not only a fair com-
mercial return on his investment, but a proprietary division of profits, which
he would not receive from any other organisation. It has been left to Aus-
tralia to apply this communistic principle to

SATURDAY, AUGUST 15, 1891.
A Governor on Grab.
“ The dear old mother country ” is a phrase
continually mouthed by Australian Imperial-
ists. Whenever they get a good chance they
remind anyone who may be listening that
Australians owe everything to that affec-
tionate and self-sacrificing Alma Mater. As
a general thing they choose banquets and
layings of foundation-stones, and other
“ functions ” of that kind, for expression of
their sentiments. On such occasions they
are able, as it were, to get an audience down
and hit it, without their being subjected to
the risk of being struck back. Proposing a
toast affords them a famous chance. They
will drag in “The dear old,” &c,, when
giving “ The Queen, goblesser.” But they
brim over with delight w hen they can hitch
their remarks on to “ The land we live in.”
Then it is that they really revel in imported
patriotism. They are proud to claim the
name of Britons. (Cheers.) All Australians
are Britons, and it is highly creditable to
them. (Cheers.) All Britons are superior
to everybody else—(cheers) —but the genuine
stock is centred in the dear old mother
country. (Emotion.) There exists the stud-
farm, so to speak. The gentry who thus
hold forth know perfectly well that Young
Australia chafes at such remarks, but is too
courteous to hoot on a social occasion, and
hasn’t a chance of replying. Moreover,
indeed, when they hook their remarks on to
“The Queen,” anyone who should look un-
pleasant would be charged with insulting
a lady—unmanly wretch ! It is people
of this Jingo quality, who are in the
habit of affirming that the dear old
mother country displayed unparalleled
generosity when she conferred on the several
Australian colonies the right to freely deal
with the lands within their respective boun-
daries. It is these same gentry who assert
that the dear old mother country has shown
extraordinary benevolence in lending these
colonies two hundred millions sterling or so
on public account and about half as much
again as private advances.
* # #
That the territory generously granted to
the people who occupied and explored it
was supposed to be worthless or thereabouts
at the time the concession was made disturbs
those Jingoes not at all. To hear them,
it might be thought that the genuine, pure-
bred Britons who stay at home had, by their
extraordinary talents and exertions,” made
Australia habitable and valuable, and there-
upon, with gorgeous self-denial, bestowed it
upon the thankless and undeserving persons
who happened to be loafing in the territory.
One would also imagine that the lent three
hundred millions or so, had been presented
unconditionally in the purest spirit of philan-
thropy and of natural affection, without any
stipulation for repayment or for so much
interest per shent. The common, vulgar
Australian, however, recognises these truths
and listens with undemonstrative contempt
to the mawkish blatherings of after-dinner
Imperialists. He has arrived at the know-
ledge that the dear old mother country has
never made one single sacrifice for Aus-
tralia. He is j)et’fectly acquainted with
the fact that in the seventies, at a
time when the British Island Britons
were of opinion that these colonies cost
more than the profit derived from them,
a deliberate and pretty strong hint was
thrown out to Australians that there would
be no objection offered Avere they to dis-
solve partnership with the old country. He
is aware, moreover, that the parental affec-
tion, since so much vaunted, never carried
away the people of Great Britain to any
outbursts of generosity, in any respect dif-
ferent from ordinary speculative dealings
Avith alien communities; and that money
Avas just as readily provided to satisfy the
applications of Chilians and Argentines
and Uruguayans and Turks and Egyptians
and Russians and Portuguese as it AA'as
to “ ad\ 7 ance the interests of our brethren
in the Antipodes.” The events consequent
on the national aspirations in Egypt, of
which the reA r olt headed by Arabi was the
manifestation, have also opened the eyes of
the common Australian to Avhat might be
the result Avere any indication given that
Australia might be disposed to snap “the
crimson thread of kinship ” and the gilt-
steel bond of dependence Avhich c institute
the British money-lenders’ security for their
investments in these colonies.
* * *
If Australians were not fully alive to these
aspects of the Imperial connection the
recently - published despatch by Lord
Kintore, Governor of South Australia, to
the Secretary of State for the Colonies,
Avould have sufficed to arouse him. Lord
Kintore is one of the batch of gold-plated
persons of title, which was recently dis-
patched by the Tory Government of Great
Britain to officiate in the Australian colonies,
in response to the declarations of “returned
Australians,” travelling Companions of
Saints Michael and George, “leading”
journalists, and other snobs avlio pre-
tended to be, and Avere accepted as being,
representatives of Australian public feeling.
Lately, Lord Kintore took a trip across the
continent from South to North, in the
course of which he traversed what is termed
the Northern Territory, a tract placed pro-
visionally under the administration of the
South Australian Government. On the
strength of his couple of years’ residence in
Australia and this bit of OA r erlanding, the
Peer, who is unconscious that, despite pro-
longed habitation and this trip, he is still
ranked among newchums, assumes airs, as is
not uncommon Avith newchums at that stage,
of authority on the most difficult problems
of Australian settlement. It Avas at precisely
the same stage of Australian experience that
Julian Thomas, known in literary circles as
“ The Vagabond,” visited North Queensland,
as a special commissioner for the Melbourne
Argus, at a time when the statesmen and
old inhabitants of the Northern cohmy were
Avrestling with the problem how to deal with
the Chinese question. Mr. Thomas, after
a short residence in Cooktown, convulsed
all Queensland Avith laughter by Aviring to
his employers that he had arrived at a settle-
ment of the Avhole difficulty. Now, Mr.
Thomas is, by virtue of native endowments,
an immeasurably abler man than Lord Kin-
tore, and he brought to the investigation he
Avas charged Avith, qualifications such as few
men possessed and to which Lord Kintore
is entirely a stranger. Mr. Thomas had led
a roving life, had visited many regions of the
world, and had sharpened his powers of
observation and judgment by attrition on all
sorts, conditions, and races of men. Lord
Kintore, on the other hand, is simply an
Eton and Oxford young man ; a Park and
Piccadilly young man. Yet, he has ventured
to assert his competency to settle, after just
the same inadequate Australian experience,
the question, an alleged settlement of which
under like conditions, overwhelmed Mr.
Thomas beneath the ridicule of experienced
colonists.
* * *
Even this exploit has not satisfied Lord
Kintore’s self-complacency. Besides settling
the Chinese question, he disposes of the
future of all tropical Australia, and sum-
marily adjudges the much-vexed questions of
a transcontinental raihvay and wholesale land
alienation. Into a single dispatch to Loi’d
Knutsford, this eminently rash young man
crowds a farrago of erroneous “facts,” pre-
posterous inferences, and mischievous anti-
Australian suggestions. His Lordship pro-
nounces that the average Avhite man is
incapable of sustained exertion in tropical
Australia, and that European Avomen and
children do not thrive in these regions. Both
of these assertions are capable of disproof.
There are thousands of men and hundreds of
Avomen who can controvert them from their
own experience. The 'assertion has, in
fact, been made and disproved over
and over again, long before Lord
Kintore ever thought of Australia.
And it has always been advanced by the
same class of persons, and Avith the same
ulterior purpose. That purpose is ordin-
arily kept somewhat in the background, but
Lord Kintore, being a more than usually
green disputant, trots it out in his very next
sentence. “It is clear,” he remarks, Avith
innocent candour, “ that no employer Avould
be likely to continue to pay 10s. a day to
Europeans for labour which, as a rule, they
are incapable of satisfactorily performing,
seeing that Asiatics can work continuously
and satisfactorily at a much lower wage."
And he is, unfortunately, enabled to support
his position by reference to the fact that
the South Australian Legislature has quite
recently passed an Indian Coolie Immigra-
tion Act for application to the Northern
Territory. His Lordship is even less happy in
the next bit of testimony he adduces. This
is the unhappy condition of agriculture in
North Queensland —an unhappy condition
which he gives Lord Knutsford to under-
stand is due to the failure of white men to
endure labour in the climate. It so happens,
on the contrary, that the stagnation of
agriculture in North Queensland may, with
more justice, be attributed to the failure of
the very course which the Governor of S A.
recommends the introduction of cheap
coloured or Asiatic labour. Not that slave-
labour might not be made to pay, but because
the white colonists of Queensland simply will
not permit it to exist. Lord Kintore was
absolutely ignorant at the time when he
penned his dispatch that the owners of
plantations in tropical Queensland had
found a solution for the difficulties into
which they had been plunged by the prohi-
bition of coloured labour, and that the
solution was simply to sell their plantations
in moderate-sized lots to white settlers on
the instalment principle, with assistance in
the way of implements, while undertaking
to buy and manufacture the raw products of
these white farmers’ industry.
* * *
The absolute ignorance of Lord Kintore
on this point is no inference of ours. It is
clearly expressed by words in the dispatch.
“ Asyour Lordship is aware,” he writes, “the
Queensland Act for Indian Coolie Labour has
been repealed, the Polynesian Labour Act
expires next year, and the Chinese are
rigorously excluded. It is therefore difficult
to see what course the Queensland sugar-
planters can adopt to prevent their
machinery standing idle, or, indeed, to avoid
the abandonment of their plantations.”
Prompted by the imagined plenitude of
information and experience derived from
a canter from Adelaide to Port Darwin, and
by his actual wealth of ignorance, this
glittering new-chum proceeds to trifle with
the destinies of all Australia, He impeaches
the judgment of Australian legislators in
Brisbane and Adelaide as beingthatof persons
“ mainly ignorant of the conditions of tropi-
cal life, and swayed by constituencies
having little interest in or prejudiced against
the methods and management of tropical
colonies.” This is perhaps the most magnifi-
cent display of supercilious and self-satisfied
newchumishness in the whole of the remark-
able dispatch we are considering. Poor
Lord Kintore has evidentally fallen pros-
trate into the mental self-sufficiency which
more or less bewrays all immigrants at his
stage of colonial experience. He knows
everything, and all older colonists lack ex-
perience and sense. No one has ever done
any overlanding such as he has accomplished,
and inasmuch as he has visited the tropics,
all other inhabitants of Australia have
omitted to do so. It follows, of course, that
he considers himself competent to teach
Australians how to manage their own
business. This frame of mind is so common
among new-chums that it would merely
evoke the customary smile, were it not that
this particular greenhorn is Governor of a
colony and is thus in a position to embody
his fatuousness in the form of a dispatch,
and present it as serious advice to the
Government of Great Britain.
* * *
Regarded in this light, Lord Kintore’s
conclusions are past a joke, and may be
productive of the gravest consequences.
On the grounds stated, he has under-
taken to influence the Government of South
Australia to the most unpatriotic expedients,
and the Government of Great Britain to
adopt a coui'se which would inflict desperate
damage upon the Australian Commonwealth.
“I am in hopes,” he writes, “that my
Government may see their way to undertake
to do their utmost to render operative legis-
lation providing for the supply of Indian
Coolie Labour for a stated term of 9 years,
in order to attract to the Northern Territory
enterprise which has been killed in Queens”-
land, and capital to carry it on.” Not
content with this, the South Australian
Governor proceeds to hint that it might be
just as well were the Northern Terri-
tory taken out of the hands of Aus-
tralians altogether and converted into
a Crown Colony. Such a suggestion,
if not rebutted by the most determined
remonstrances on the part of the constitu-
tionally-governed colonies, is but too apt to
commend itself to the grabbing financiers
and syndicate-mongers of Great Britain.
Since Western Australia received a consti-
tution there has been no part of this con-
tinent in which a British Minister could order
a free gift of a million acres to be granted to
a globe-trotting nobleman, as Avas done there
in the case of the late guinea-pig Duke of
Manchester. Were the Northern Territory
withdrawn from Australian control this plea-
sant process could be revived. In accord-
ance with the spirit and purport of Lord
Kintore’s recommendation, huge tracts
might be granted to British land-grabbers on
the agreeable condition that they undertook
to import so many Chinese or Indian coolies
to work on the land. By supplementing this
with the adoption of the land-grant system
of trans-continental railway construction -
ikevvise to be accompanied by the introduc-
tion of Oriental labour —the entire social and
political fabric of Australian existence could
be undermined. The conditions which
brought about the civil war in North America
could be thus implanted in Australia. And
all these miseries because the busybodies in
London, called returned Australians, and the
wealthy lower orders who constitute the
Government House sets in our own capitals,
have managed to persuade the Colonial Office
that our essentially democratic communi-
ties “dearly love a lord” to preside over
their affairs, and don’t mind how verdant or
how gawky the lord may be.
* * *
It is requisite that a peremptory stop
should be put to Lord Kintore’s impertin-
ences and to all similar interferences with
the destinies of Australia by young gentle-
men exported to satisfy the unwholesome
cravings of the snob-circles after persons oi
title to rub against. The publication ot
Lord Kintore’s most mischievous dispatch
can only be attributed to a most exceptional
accident. The complacency of his Lordship
has been so supreme that he has been per-
fectly satisfied that his ravings are exemplars
of profoundest statesmanship, and certain
to be acceptable to every sensible person in
Australia It is impossible to know how
many more dispatches of like tendency have
emanated from British Governors in the
several colonies. But it is natural, after
having been let behind the scenes in this
instance, that uneasy conjectures should assail
Australians, that this sort of thing may have
been going on for a long time in the confiden-
tial communications between Governors and
Secretaries of State. It appears that while
our Legislatures have been playing at Fede-
ration conferences and all the rest of it,
there has appeared to the mind of at least
one British Governor of an Australian pro-
vince no incompatibility in supposing that
the Colonial Office would calmly accept and
act upon suggestions that a big slice of the
continent should be withdrawn from Aus-
tralian control and converted into a receiving
depot for Chinamen and Hindoos, who would
unfailingly filter past the borders of the
slave-state so created, and, by invading the
constitutionally -governed provinces, over-
turn and destroy all those social and
industrial arrangements which the European
population are working out for themselves.
To Lord Kintore, the proposals embodied
in his dispatch bear, no doubt, an aspect of
judicious, although somewhat superior and
uncommon, sense. He will probably be
surprised to learn that, in the opinion of The
Bulletin, they are pregnant with the seeds
of insurrection, bloodshed, and separation or
subjection.
Wanted: A Code.
It is a healthy sign to see a lawyer leading the
attack on the venerable iniquity miscalled Law.
The stronghold of chartered injustice has held
out stubbornly for many centuries against
the assaults of reason and progress and en-
lightenment ; but when its own defenders begin
to come out, we may hope that the walls are
growing shaky. The Labour-party in the New
(South Wales Assembly will do well to keep
their eyes on George Reid, who may be very
useful to them by and by. Their present and
only business is to get Electoral Reform. “ One-
man-one-vote ” is the most important plank in
their platform yet. There will be no candid,
straightforward, unforced legislation in the in-
terests of the people until the legislature
truly represents the people. Bur when that
does come about, then anybody who has any
sensible practical scheme for bringing the
system of law and legal procedure into
something like harmony with popular ideas will
be welcome to step forward and unpack his
soul. It is the imperative duty of a genuinely
democratic legislature to see that the laws of
the country reflect the will of the people of the
country, and there will have to be a great cart-
ing away of mouldy legal rubbish before that
can be said, of the laws of any of the Australias,
or indeed of any square foot of British territory
under the sun. Perhaps George Reid can
assist in sorting out from the rubbish the little
useful material that, having hitherto been over-
looked by the lawyers, has inadvertently been
allowed to remain.
* * *
The only system of law-reform that can be
expected to give satisfaction to the people of
Australia is a system that goes down to first
principles and makes a fresh start. We need
not trouble ourselves about the jar that it will
give the “Constitution” and the venerable
superstitions of our ancestors. Our ancestors
are comfortably packed away underground,
thank Heaven, and when the jumble of cranky
atrocities that those old humorists of the
middle ages jocularly called a legal system has
been duly interred along with them, it will
make the air clearer for to-day’s generation.
We may not be any wiser than our forefathers ;
but a good many things that were good enough'
for them are not good enough for us.
* # #
Our ancestors made laws as they wanted
them to suit their own circumstances, or rather
the laws were made for our ancestors by, and
to suit those who were bossing them at the
time. We have the right to make our own
laws, and they should be made to suit our cir-
cumstances. We are more or less free Aus-
tralians, living close up against the far end of
the nineteenth century, and the chances are not
in favour of our being properly suited with laws
or anything else that were intended for English
serfs when the centuries were just beginning to
get into their teens. We have no call to deal
tenderly with old laws. There is no sanctity
about them. The English nation didn’t get
their code handed down from Sinai on tables of
stone. Laws have no more claim to reverence


of partnership or the articles of
tba, N«tion of a joint-stock company. In fact,
ass ociatio whj J. the laws 0 f a nation amount
t iat Hitherto the British race has allowed the
H Lc run in the interests of the
concern _ now t i ie shareholders have come
to’have a’sav in the matter, it is time to over-
Sul the articles of association and re-cast them
from end to end.
# * *
The simple question is, whether two or three
ill inn Australians, freeborn in theory, and
*v u .* „ nrettv vigorous determination to
Sl °kfi 1 themselves free in fact, are or are not fit
Sty down for themselves the rules by which
their transactions with one another are to be
governed. If they arc, then why should they
Slow themselves to be overborne in all their
civU relations by a horde of king-cursed and
1: ridden semi-barbarians who formerly
Sffed the distant British Islands? Why
should they suffer their criminal-law policy to
Lp dictated by the unmitigated barbarians who,
in the inscrutable wisdom of Providence were
iiprmitted to invent and put in practice a
B er , lirv 'iso the “ system ” that turned the
hemisphere into a seething hell ? Will
’ member of Parliament, after reading, say,
the New South Wales Criminal Law Amend-
ment Act steadily through, venture to say in
„old blood that he considers it to be
such a code of criminal jurisprudence as
a young, free, and enlightened nation
m i 2 hb adopt with a sense of satisfaction,
if it were turning its hands to the law-making
business for the first time, and had no traditions
or rooted prejudices to take account of i If
not why should it remain on the statute-book ?
If it suits the people, if it be adapted to their cir-
cumstances, by all means let it stay. Though it
is a gory anachronism, a relic of the times thar
we have put behind us, a companion horror to
the triangles and the cat, it may be that a
majority of the people’s representatives have
no fault to find with it—that they are quite
satisfied to live in a country where a man, who
wants to be hanged, can take his pick out of
one of the choicest collections of capital offences
to be found anywhere on the surface of the
earth. Then give them an opportunity of
saying so. Let them take on themselves the
responsibility of re-enacting the statute, section
by section.
* * *
The one merit of the criminal law in New
South Wales is that there is very little doubt
about it. If you want to know the charge for
any given diversion—from picking your neigh-
bour’s pocket to cutting his throat —you have
only to refer to Sir Alfred Stephen’s carefully-
compiled and comprehensive tariff. There is
no such royal road to learning on the civil side
of law in any of the Australasias. The only
way to ascertain for certain what your
rights and liabilities are, under a contract which
you may have been foolish enough to sign,
is to bring an action on it in the Supreme
Court, and then appeal to the Privy Council.
If you succeed you will find that you are
entitled to pay a large sum for costs, and if you
are lucky subsequently the Insolvency Court
authorities will not suspend your certificate for
more than three months. But the point of law
will be settled. Nobody knows what the law
is on most points in any Australian province.
That is the sole reason why it continues to be
the law. The first duty of the law-reformer is
to get a man, or half-a-dozen men, appointed to
write out in plain English a concise statement
of what the law under each of its branches is
supposed to be. That would do the whole
business. No argument would be needed.
Somebody would at once bring in a Bill of one
clause to this effect; —‘ ‘ Be it enacted that all
laws in force are repealed from this date.”
And it would pass through Parliament in
one sitting. Then there would be a clean sheet
for the commencement of a code that would
not look like the production of a medieval
crusader.
# # #
There was a crafty statute passed in the reign
of his sacred Majesty Charles 11., a little over
200 years ago, “ for the prevention of frauds
and perjuries.” That Act and the osculation
of the Holy Scripture are still the chief safe-
guards in Australia as well as English Courts
of alleged Justice against false oaths. If a
plaintiff, suing a defendant for the price of a
suit of clothes, goes into the box and swears
that he made the suit for a third person on the
defendant verbally “guaranteeing” payment, he
will be promptly nonsuited because the law con-
siders that no man can be trusted to swear the
truth in a matter of that sort. But if the
plaintiff has been there before, he swears
that the defendant said “ You make the clothes,
and I’ll pay you,” and gains a verdict. It’s the
same individual, and he kisses the same greasy
Bible; but while, if he swears to one form of
words, his evidence is admissible, he is not
allowed to swear to the other for fear he should
perjure himself. In the same way the man
who sues his employer on an unwritten engage-
ment to take him on for 12 months certain,
finds that his case turns entirely on the question
whether he is prepared to swear that the 12
months was to commence the day the engage-
ment was made, or the next day. If he has
had anybody to put him up to the statute “ for
the prevention of frauds and perjuries,” he
kisses the book cheerfully and swims ahead ; it
not, he comes a cropper. There were no doubt
reasons for enacting a law of that kind which
were perfectly satisfactory to its hydrocephalous
authors in the year of grace 1677. We don’t
complain of their passing it. But why should
such a piece of legislation, with its brother
abortions on every page of the statute-book,
hang round our necks in the last decade of the
nineteenth century ? We must do justice,
however, to our forefathers. There is Aus-
tralian legislation dating within the decade
that antiquity would find it hard to
beat. It may not be generally known
that by the Criminal Law Amendment Act of
■New South Wales every married woman in the
province —unless entitled to a decree annulling
her marriage—could lay an information against
her husband rendering him liable to fourteen
years’ penal servitude and three floggings. The
knowledge of this fact should be balm to some
of the more strident spinsters of the Women’s
Suffrage League. It meets one of their choicest
grievances.
* # *
And once more The Bulletin says : Wipe it
all clean out, and let ns have a code—not a
mere compilation from the hands of some Cock-
ney lawyer-knight, but an adaptation to the
needs of Australia of the best laws of the most
democratic countries of the world.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Two Governors-Creaeral.
The news that the British Tory Government
propose to establish a censorship of the native
press in India, and the cablegram that
some native papers are to be prosecuted for
sedition, is an instructive commentary on
a good many different subjects. The Indian
press is the mouthpiece of some 270,000,000
souls, forming more than three-fourths of the
population of the entire British Empire. It is
the one and only means by which this vast
mass of humanity can protest against the
exactions of British officials and the lop-sided
justice of British magistrates—against the
ruinous policy of extravagance which has loaded
India with an enormous debt and a vast mass
of taxation—against the lying of British diplo-
macy, the forcible introduction of landlordism
in place of the old system of common tenure
which once prevailed in many parts of the
country, and a hundred other grievances. There
are no Parliamentary institutions in the coun-
try—there is no modern history, except that
which is written by British historians for the
purpose of demonstrating the benefits and
advantages of the Christian autocracy —there is
absolutely no means of protest except through
the press, and even it has never ventured to
protest save in a minor key, for fear of the
irresponsible satrap at Calcutta. Yet even the
feeble remonstrance of Indian journalism is to
be smothered for the future, and three-fourths
of Britain’s subjects will thus lose the last
semblance of human liberty. There is a moral
in this which is particularly appropriate in
these days when Federation is “in the air.”
What the Governor-General of India does is
exactly what the Governor-General of United
Australia would do if the opportunity pre-
sented itself, and for that reason Australia
must take no chances and run no risks. The
Indian Viceroy has the power to run an autocratic
Government on the Russian model—to pile up
an immense debt and weigh the nation down
with the burden of a huge army—to fill the
offices of state with a countless swarm of
corrupt, expensive, and useless officials—to
arrest and imprison any native of influence who
is not sufficiently subservient to the Foreign
invaders, and to gag the press —and, simply
because he has the power, he does all these
things. The old, benevolent drivel about a
civilising mission, and an inborn love of free-
dom, and such matters count for nothing ; the
requisite brute force is available, and therefore
Britain’s representative goes the whole hog
without hesitation. And in like manner the
Commonwealth Bill gives the coming Australian
viceroy authority to create a Ministry out of his
own friends and hangers-on—to keep that
Ministry in power either with or without the
consent of Parliament—and to do as he darned
well likes without consulting the Executive
Council if it pleases him, and, because he has
the power, the imported Governor-General of
Australia will do these things, provided a crisis
should arise which will make it worth his while
to run the risk. The two Governors-General
will be built of the same material, will be men
of the same class and the same nation, with
the same prejudices'and the same training,
and will receive their instructions from
the same Government ; and both starting
from the same causes they will arrive at the
same results. When the Parkes Government
issued its mysterious pamphlet explaining away
the anomalies and discrepancies of the great
Convention bungle, it was claimed in that
historic document that all these extraordinary
concessions to Imperialism mattered nothing,
because the Governors-General would never take
advantage of the powers conferred upon them.
It is sufficient answer to this assumption that
the other Governor-General—he of Calcutta —is
endowed with still greater powers, and that he
uses them to the uttermost whenever the
interests of British supremacy demand it. And
as his brother and duplicate in Australia will
be sent out to represent British interests in
exactly the same way, he will act in just the
same manner when the occasion requires it, and
the occasion will require it the very first day
Australia refuses to be sacrificed to British
policy. If the Convention Bill passes in its
present suicidal form, then when England’s
next big war comes along, and this country fails
to see why Sydney and Melbourne should be
bombarded or burnt in England’s quarrel, it
will l)o discovered that the two Governors-
General are wonderfully alike after all.

N aturalisation.
Ninian Melville, M.P. (N.S.W.), wants to
make the naturalisation of aliens more difficult
of obtainal, by grafting on to the preliminary
five years’ residence and the twenty-shillings’
qualification - fee an examination in English
literature and law. The qualification for voting
now existing is purely a residential one, and it
would not only be ridiculous, but unjust, to
substitute for it, in racial cases only, an intel-
lectual standard. Many Germans, on arrival,
know more, from a literary point of view, of
British literature and law than a great
proportion of the residents of Australia.
Is it right that those men should be dis-
qualified from voting on account of a presum-
able intellectual deficiency, or a lack of oral
volubility in the use of English ? Surely not.
The lack of acquaintance with English forms of
speech does not absolve the foreigner from
subjection to Australian laws, whether framed
here or borrowed from Britain; it does not
release him from his obligations to contribute
to the revenue. As a matter of fact, the resid-
ence of an alien in Australia imposes on him
all the obligations, moral and monetary, of
citizenship, while depriving him, for a time, of
its highest privilege —the right, by selection of a
representative, to have a voice in the making
and administration of the laws in this land of
his adoption. The Bulletin, unlike Mr. Mel-
ville, M.L.A., is cosmopolitan, and would like
to sec naturalisation made easier of accomplish-
ment. In America the alien is admitted in
most States after six months’ residence (four
months’ in Minnesota) to all the privileges of
American citizenship, on making statutory de-
claration of desire to enjoy that citizenship,
coupled with a casting aside of allegiance pre-
viously given to outside princes, potentates,
and powers. Some day the intelligent Britisher
arriving in Australia will require to abjure
himself, by statutory declaration, of his
oath of allegiance to the House of Guelph ;
meantime, the law which makes five years’
residence and a twenty-shilling fee the con-
ditions of Australian citizenship to the intelli-
gent foreigner, is undemocratic, stupid and
tyrannical.
+
Chinese “Raids.”
The anti-Chinese deputation which recently
waited upon Premier Parkes to urge the sup-
pression of the Mongolian fan-tan industry
made about as large a mistake as any one depu-
tation could well do. According to the evidence
brought forward, there are something like 400
yellow speculators in Sydney alone, who live
exclusively by running various seductive
games ; and in one end of a leading street no
less than thirty-six “ hells ” are in full blast
about six or seven days in the week. Further,
it is claimed that the police receive liberal tips
from the proprietary heathen, and thereby the
way of Ah Sin is made smooth, and he is enabled
to lead his patrons in green pastures without
interference. This was the case advanced by
the deputation, and on the strength of it the
said deputation demanded that “raids” should
be made with greater frequency in order that
the idolater might become dispirited and aban-
don his nefarious occupation. It would have
been a great deal more to the point if it had de-
manded that raids, as the term is at present
understood, should be entirely abandoned, now
and for evermore. There is no more sense in
raiding a Chinese gambler than there is in raid-
ing a larrikin or a burglar, and if the former
individual were treated with the same Spartan
brevity as the others he would be captured a
great deal oftener. The difference between the
methods employed is just the reason why the
Mongol flourishes. When a vigorous and in-
telligent policeman hears six rowdies rioting in
a hotel, he simply rushes in and seizes the
first one he can get hold of, and as many
more as he can capture with both hands, and it
is a cold day when he fails to secure at least
two law-breakers by this simple and effective
process. If he came across thirty-six such riots
in a day, he would probably rush in and get
somebody every time. But the same officer
wanders daily past the thirty-six fan-tan estab-
lishments already mentioned, and though he
knows that the law is being broken in every
one of them, he doesn’t rush in or capture
anybody. Apparently, too, his superiors
never even ask why he allows his beat to
be crowded up with criminals, without any
interference on his part. But, about once in a
long time these officials organise a massive
expedition, which looks as if it were going to
storm a besieged city, and send it out against
the enemy. It takes weeks to get it up, and
while it is preparing, there is an air of bustle
and dark, piratical excitement about the depart-
ment which gives the whole proceeding away.
Also, there are paragraphs in the evening
papers, and only the most thick-headed of
Mongols can fail to take warning. The hollow
tramp of the expedition can be heard two streets
away, and the proceedings are about as con-
spicuous as a torchlight procession, accompanied
by bonfires and blazing kerosene, and banners
and a brass band, and when the great cara-
van gets fairly started, it is generally about
a month too late to capture anybody. The
burden and physical exhaustion of the movement
make it practically impossible to get up more
than one raid in ten weeks without wearing
holes in the department, and in between times
the Chinaman follows his calling in peace. The
only possible conclusion is that there is too
much style about the campaign. A Chinaman
is easy to capture —much easier, as a rule, than
the smallest of Aryan drunks, and he is twenty
times less formidable than even a dwarf bur-
glar. If they went home and organised them-
selves, and laid in provisions for a campaign,
and called out the reserves, when these pecu-
lators were about, they would only capture
about one prisoner per annum ; as it is, the
force jumps upon them whenever they show
themselves, and takes them without any cere-
mony. The same process would suit the fan-tan
sharp admirably. If the passing constable
rushed his premises in a plain, disorganised,
rough-and-ready fashion every time he had
reason to believe the law was being broken
inside—which is probably about 38 times a day
—and collared any law-breaker he could get
hold of in the confusion, just as lie does with
other kinds of criminals, he would produce
more effect than 150 years of the present
elaborate system. If he got one Mongol in six
tries, on a steady average, the fan-tan business
would fall off in less than a week. This is an
exceedingly simple remedy, but apparently no
one ever thought of it before. The Chinese
Anti-Gambling Association doesn’t want more
frequent raids—what it wants is one raid that
will last all the time. And as the law provides
for this, the deputation might reasonably have
asked Parkes what had become of the law, and
why it wasn’t enforced ?

Railway Revelations in Victoria.
The new yearning for political purity in
Victorian railways management is alleged to
be finding expression in the reports of a Stand-
ing Committee, Bent, as arch-angel, in the
chair. For months past, these seekers after
truth have prowled around the wilderness,
absorbing a good deal of refreshment on their
weary way, to collect evidence respecting lines
that run nowhere in particular, and stations
erected for the convenience of rural populations
which don’t exist. Armed with the sorrowful
fact that Commissioner Speight’s estimates arc
constructed on the same commercial principles
as the baseless fabric of a dream—knowing, as
everybody knows, that the sure profit on each
scheme of railway extension always results in a
certain loss—the Standing Committee went
forth to find an explanation that was already
clear as daylight to the community at large.
No picnic pilgrimage was necessary, and the
Standing Committee might as well have stood
on their heads at the top of Collins-street all
the time. But they penetrated into the interior
on a comfortable salary, collecting statistics on
the spot, and ocular proofs at the scene of
action, until at last they felt justified in advis-
ing their bleeding country that the explanation
of the great railway joke was land—L A N D—
land. The previous innocence of Tom Bent
and his colleagues on this otherwise well-known
point, indicates that they must be political
Arcadian shepherds who haven’t read The
Bulletin as much as one could wish. Now
that they know, however, they are quite
alarmingly free with disclosures, and moral
comments thereon, and the Age, in an equally
reckless spirit, quotes as follows from the
Committee’s report:—
In many Instances lines have been surveyed dose to
three chain roads, which might be used as the track for
the railway, thereby saving almost the entire sum esti-
mated by the department for land and compensation.
The Inglewood to Durham Ox line is one of many cases in
point. The country is almost level, and the local bodies
interested have written to the committee stating that
they are quite willing to give portion of the road for the
railway track. Another instance is the proposed railway
from Longwood to Nalinga, where the surveyor of the
department suggested to the Engineer-in-Chief that the
line should be carried along a two-chain main road for a
distance of six or seven miles, giving as his reasons that
there was considerable settlement along it, and a large
traffic, besides room to run the line on it. Notwith-
standing this, he was directed to survey the land at the
side of that road, and on no account to keep on the road.
The above piece of report upon lines yet un-
made throws a little light upon lines already
created and worked at a loss, or rather it
doesn’t throw any light, but merely officially
confirms what the public have long known, or
shrewdly suspected, to be a fact —viz., that the
first consideration in constructing Victorian
railway lines is the purchase of somebody’s land
on terms satisfactory to the vendor. On the
vital question of why land that has been sur-
veyed and estimated to cost a certain amount,
should invariably cost twice as much, the Stand-
ing Committee seem to preserve a dark, signifi-
cant silence. Nor do they report upon the
careful and well-considered folly of the average
Victorian Government in selling at, a low figure,
slices of soil to private individuals in order that •
the Railway Department may promptly buy
them back again at a high figure. No,
indeed. The object of the Committee is to dis-
close just as much information as looks bad for
Speight (a risky policy even at that) without
attempting to explain matters that would look
a deal worse for other people. What the Vic-
torians sigh for is a complete list of the legis-
lators who have personally, or through their
dummies, sold land for railway purposes, or
otherwise profited by the laying down of un-
called for lines. The befooled taxpayer wishes
to know the true history of all land taken up
by this extravagant Department, as well as the
reason why the line which ought to run straight
is generally found to diverge a little to the left
when it isn’t making a semi-circular curve the
other way. And, unless the Standing Com-
mittee can supply this long-felt want, they
might as well sit down, for all the real good
they are likely to do.

Dear Bulletin, —The British and Australian
laws defining insanity leave no medical loop-hole
of escape for a murderer who has never suffered
from concussion of the brain, sustained fits of
dementia, chronic “strangeness of manner,” or
has been preceded by a long family line of
maniacs, whose confinement in padded cells can
be proved to the satisfaction of the Court.
Insanity, according to the bewigged fossil who
first thought it out for the British Empire at
large, or the fossil who last amended the ideas
of his venerable predecessor on the job, is that
condition of mind which prevents a person
from understanding the difference between
right and wrong. It is pretty widely recog-
nised by this time that the commonest form of
insanity, the insanity of intelligent people, is a
lack of will-power to resist an impulse which
the mind admits at the time to be foolish, rash,
cruel, or downright wicked —the sort of impulse
which seizes us, as Charles Dickens said,
when we look over the edge of a precipice, and
sorely tempts us to fling ourselves into space.
Every imaginative man has to struggle against
impolitic impulses, of which the sleepy old
law, and its equally stupid idolaters, know
nothing. Murderer Colston, ex-soldier, is an
imaginative man, a highly-intelligent fellow,
who has acquired a taste for slaughter in
good Queen Victoria’s service. His only
conceivable reason for the Narbethong
murder is set forth in his story of the crime. A
horrible old couple had concocted a miserable
scheme to blackmail him, and whilst the hus-
band was threatening to charge him with a
criminal assault upon the hag of his bosom,
Colston killed him. Then Colston “thought
of the old woman,” he says, and went back to
the cottage and killed her. The fury of this
being spent, he became sane as other people
and made himself scarce forthwith. If “general
paralysis of the insane ” means occasional
paralysis of the impulse-resisting power, then
Colston has no doubt got it badly. But, as
half-a-dozen ridiculous doctors state that the
complaint in question is idiocy and raving mad-
ness rolled into one, why, nothing can be
plainer than the fact that Colston hasn’t got it,
except the further fact that a sensible defence
on the mad theory lines might—not as a matter
of law, but as a matter of grace on the part of
the Executive and public opinion—have saved
him from being judicially murdered at an early
date.—Yours, E.F.

the gallows the benefit of the doubt. However,

imprisonment for committing 400 forgeries in-

pocketed from the Commercial Banking Co., of

Dr. A. J Beehag, a brilliant young Sydney
medico, has died of typhoid fever. He had been
but two years in practice and yet enjoyed an
income of at least £5OOO. The doctor had in him
a very strong spice of originality; was a most
excellent operator, and had achieved excellent
results by the use of menthol in pthisis. He had
allowed himself to run down by overwork, and so
could not fight the fever when it came. The death
of such a man is a national loss.
[?]
810 Macquarie-strect North, Sydney, August 12,1891.
My Dear Moorarinua,—
The Bernhardt boom is over, and the cantankerous
“pusson ” who could do those things ever so much better
herself finds herself justified in get ting out the little bow and
arrow. For instance, rather a boring feature was the
way Sara used to iterate that tomato-tinted top thatch ; it
made all her women look alike —“ Frou-Frou ” might have
been “Fedora” to a deaf person who had lost
his programme. It is Sara’s pride and joy that
she never wigs it, only adding long plaits and
frizzles to her not too luxuriant thatch ; but the audience
gets tired of sorrowing with a sempiternal strawberry-
blonde. If they don’t, why does that wily comic opera-
manager cork the locks of a fourth of the chorus?
Another thing that made you think Sara’s prices rather
high was the inherent ghastliness of her make-up—on the
stage only -for off it she monkeyed with the cold cream
in a highly successful manner. There were phases of it,
certainly, but her cheek was always too chromotropish for
a nation bred up to the neurotic pale greens and yellows
of the Australienne. But I doubt if anybody anywhere
ever had ears the colour of raspberry-jam, vermilion
inner nostrils, melon-pink temples,, and fingers radish-
colour to the second joint. Apart from the make-up,
what further shook the devotion of the dress-suited
portion of the throng (by the way, in Sydney Sara was
emphatically a woman’s actress) was the widening of the
view when she turned her heels on the house. It was the
sort of prospect one would like to see the moon rise
behind.
Finally, 1 am distinctly sorry Bernhardt ever came to
Australia. Don’t you think it rather a pity such a
meteor should come to dazzle a simple and joyous com-
munity who took Brown-Potter for a histrionic immortal ?
Now they will sit and yawn and grumble at the people
who had them barn-dancing round the circle with two-
guinea bouquets in other times. If I were an “emotional
lead” I would leave tears and long trains severely alone
until Sara is utterly forgotten. Then treble recalls and
gushing notices may once more be the guerdon of the
lady who tangles her feet among the furniture and col-
lides with “ .Mario” instead of shaving him.
Black and mournful printer’s ink is the best thing to use
in embalming the last Australian appearance of Bern-
hardt, which look place at Sydney Royal on Blh inst.
before a sort of John Lucas house. “Camille” was the
bill with the agony at high-pressure, and the audience
scarcely drawing its breath, but 1 couldn't help smiling
at one thing. If somebody whispered or coughed or
dropped an aitch the whole beehive of a house rose and
“ hus-s-shed ” them down and made ever so much moie
row than the cause of it. Some of the women present
bad combed up for the final. Mayoress Manning, in prim-
rose with a cream lace scarf ; Mrs. Forbes Angus in a
picturesque yellow frock ; two sisters in yellow reminded
one vaguely of “this way to the canary-show;” a red-
faced woman aggravated her complexion by a bright
blue silk ; a stagey black velvet and white, trimmed with
gold-jewelled stuff, had a good glittering position in the
front row, and a legal gentleman’s sister in a box nearly
tipped over on to the stage as she stood up and peered
through her long-handled pince-nez at the brass bedstead
of act last.
After excited recalls and a greater deluge of floralities
than I have ever before envied (including the inevitablefloral
ship, which strikes me as being in such execrable taste-
something like handing a visitor his hat) the curtain
descended and J.C.VV. came forward with a beam-
ing smile to announce that Bernhardt would be visited
on the stage by a number of the profession, and when the
rag rose there they all were- Myra Kemble, Pattie Brown,
Elton, Bracy, Anson, Brough, Geo Rignold, W. ditto—
also a übiquitous old lady whose eldest child ha s
lately burst forth as a two-line slavey, and who regards
herself as histrionic in consequence, I suppose. Every
actor and actress of the “there’s so-and-so” sort was
staged round Sara and a French flag gently waved at
every corner of the proscenium, yards of stuff decora-
tions, showers of flowers, and the howls of the mesmerised
gallery, made the closing scene a wild, cleverly-staged-
managed enthusiasm, you bet.
After that, a large procession ambled behind the
scenes, where Sara, in the white muslin robe of the last
act, leant on a French doctor’s shoulder, and was mobbed
by her fond admirers. It was a marvel the Star didn’t
whirl in her mental orbit, for the hot, gaseous air, the
mingling odors of paint, flowers, fifty different perfumes
in the dressing-room was enough to make a strong man
falter where he stood ; but the Divine one seemed rather
to like it. Much kitten French and gushing buggery was
gone through, but the spectacle of all was when the
dapper, little, nose-glassed critic of a pious morning paper
(who is understood to be quite a harmless tame cat) was
encouraged by the doctor aforesaid to kiss Madame on
the cheek. From what I saw of it, the lady didn’t return
it, though she did put her fair arms round his neck—and
it is, therefore, highly probable that the last “ notice ” of
that recorder will contain more delirium to the square
foot than any of its predecessors. Sara got into her little
bed at the Australia when the cocks began to crow.
“The Profligate,” at Sydney Garrick, seemed a strange
erotic symptom in which the heroine looked as if she
wanted to eat off the same plate as the hero all the time,
and rushed about after him with her mouth open in a
hopelessly mashed manner that must have made the mar-
ried portion of the audience wish they were dead accord,
ingly. But Olga Nethersole dressed Mrs. Profligate
engagingly. In the first act a bridal sort of frock in cream
silk and insertion with puffed sleeves and flat hat trimmed
with yellow roses— it is nice to see a floral hat at this
period—it reminds one of the flowers that bloom in the
spring, tra la. Act 2, pink pongee with flounce of cream
Valenciennes and girdle, and pulled sleeves of pink
chiffon ; collars of cream lace and floral h&t in pink roses.
In this act the graceful Miss Stonehay comes out in a
figure which would benefit by a little dressmaker's art. I
certainly abhor a woman who makes an impromptu hosc-
and-handkerohief satchel out of her bodice every time she
goes out, but when a lady is what one may call shingle-
chested she ought certainly to manufacture an undula-
tion, otherwise the audience can never tell whether she
has got her back to them or not. In act 3 Olga wears a
beautiful dress in ivory silk, the front draped in white
chiffon designed in applique pansies ; sleeves of puffed
chiffon with pansies at the top ; Tosca sash of pansy
velvet, and a sort of Fiji apron around the front of pansy
flower-stalks and leaves. Act 4, a green velvet robe with
sleeves, yoke and petticoat (slightly revealed) cf fawn
green, making rather a picturesque tout. Of the other
people, Cautley and “ Wilfred Murray ’ looked and posed
exactly like superior shop walkers, and the betrayed
damsel was the fac simile of Lady X. There was a full-
dress house on the evening I was present, including
Virginia Earle in an infantile get-up aggravated by daffo-
dils.
What a lot of feathers they are wearing on the Block !
T 13 women I saw there on Saturday morning were all fat
and feathers.
A sort of April occasion in Sydney was the departure of
the Himalaya for England with the time-expired crews of
the Orlando, Curacoa, Cordelia, &j.—because there were
tears for the travellers and sweet, sweet smiles for
their substitutes. The naval gods made quite a little
festival of it, and a large number of people (princii ally
women, need I add?) boarded the Or'ardo at “ Ilis Ex-
cellency ” Admiral Scott’s invitation to sea the last cf the
Mohicans, so to speak. Lady Charles Scott was present,
as was every other woman who could manage to get there
anyhow, and the mixed up sentiment of the ocoas'on was
soothed by coffee and crackers in the saloon of the flag-
ship. By the way, it was simply lovely to see the way in
which a sad-faced girl, who had looked ready to weep in
her little ball cf a lacs handkerchief while the Himalaya
got under weigh, skipped down among the fiist flight for
the cake-section, altho’ the troop-ship was sti 1 gliding
mournfully out of the harbour.
Talking about naval men, there are some women who
don't love them, and there are fond mammas who like to
keep Matilda always within coo-ee, and object to her
pairing with a maritime person, because he is hustled
about so from pillar to post. One woman whose child
yielded to the entreaties of a gay sea-dog, almost weeps
over the fact that her daughter’s husband was so long away
that their three-year-old sonlet calls him “ that man.”
There is no mistake about the trail of the bill-sticker
being over us all. They 7 send notices to the dailies now
when a girl gets her to a nunnery. Says the D.T.: —“ At
St Bridget’s, Jambn’oo, last Sunday, Miss O’Brady (in
religion Sister Theodosia Mary Magdalen), daughter of Mr.
E. O’Brady, Croagingolong, was received into the order cf
“Our Lady of Mercy.” The next thing, 1 suppose, will
be a thrilling account of the robbery of Mother So-and-
so’s antique rosary, when the rival convent has boomed
itself by letting the papers know that the inmates are all
heiresses and wear silk stockings bought with their own
money.
East Sydney Rowing Club ball, at West's Rooms, on
7th instant, was one of the most successful the club has
held—quite seventy couples were present. W. Hamlin
and H. Ackland were hon. secs., and from first to last
kept the ball a-roiling by providing partners for the
partnerless and otherwise doing the guardian angel in a
dress suit. Two sisters, in white silk with pretty
bouquets, looked well; so did a sea-green spotted net
trimmed with gold ; cream, with long art draperies of
yellow, edged with chiffon frills, suited a married lady ;
and a cream brocade, edged with gold braid, would have
been all serene if the girl hadn’t made it herself. Some
crossed oars added to the decorations on the dais—but
why did they put up a pair of sculls with no “ buttons ”
on them. They didn’t look “ professional”—not a bit.
Speaking; of sales—a plethora of which always occurs in
August—l am told that at a big one in Sydney an
went about warning the shoppers to look after their bags
and purses. Quite English, you know, wasn’t it? And
yet, after all, the greatest pocket danger lay in the beau-
tiful young lady behind the counter who was pushing a
mildewed line in her best manner and draping a damaged
parcel of plush so that the spots wouldn’t show.
Quite a gay circle (including a Yaucluse theatre party)
assembled at the Criterion, the other night, to giggle at
the Frenchy funniments of “ Dr. Bill ” with Myra Kemble
playing the frisky Mrs. Horton in several nice frocks.
Myra’s seraphic form has cast off the plumpness of in-
activity, and she looks charming all along—especially in
the silk tea-gown with chiffon sleeves and girdle of sage-
green and gold guipure in which she flabbergasted the
Brown family. And, talking of the second act, when
“ Dr. Bill ” was in Brisbane, uninitiated scene-shifters
were called in on one occasion when the others were on
strike. In the middle of the second act, as the maid was
fishing for the key among Mrs. Horton’s corsets, down
came the rag with a run. “ Why did you let the curtain
down?” fumed Myra to the blushing “frauds.” “Why,
mum,” came the response, “ we thort it was time, as you
was beginning to take your clothes orf.” By the way,
one can’t help smiling at Pattie Brown’s kangaroo-dance,
although that quicksilver little lady is suffering from a
complicated Latin knee complaint in three syllables, and
ought not to be on the gay fantastic toe.
In happy tadpole times, when the rain descends and
the mud riseth up to meet them, one can’t help being
struck by the feeble grip with which the average woman
hitches her pendant draperies out of harm’s wet way.
Half the back of her gown is grabbed high and dry,
certainly, and then the other half is left hanging loosely,
swabbing up all the liquid increment round about, and
the last state of that woman is worse than her first. But
one hardly blames her—for there are only two ways of
keeping one’s final frill spotless in bad weather, and
neither of them looks nice enough to be photographed in.
One is to take off your skirt and hang it in a dry place ;
the other is to give both hands to the job, and trust to
the chivalry of your male friends to look another way as
you loom across the gutter. To keep a clean keel and
look pretty in the rain, is about as impossible as to fall
up a hill.
Ad. from a recent S.M. Herald :
SUPERIOR Woman, with personal refs., Protestant,
as Nurse and Needlewoman, under-nurse kept;
children walk in their oivn grounds. Mrs. Blank,
Blank. Open two days.
“ Walk in their own private grounds” is lovely, consider-
ing that there isn’t such a thing in or about the whole
length and breadth of Sydney, where the stuccoed mansion
generally abuts on the main road, and one hears the
dinner-gong at. the front-gate. Under the average cir-
cumscribed circumference, I suppose the order would
lia\e to be—“ Exercise the children round the drying-
paddock, Parker!”
I wonder if a scribbler ever realises the awful danger
there is in trying to get too far off the beaten track of
every-day English’? For instance, recently I turned up a
country paper in which the reporter, “doing” a local
wedding, ambiguously commences; "Monday was the
day Mr. Smith and Miss Brown elected to jump over the
broomstick,” &c. The spectacle of a broomstick jumping
over the reporter was the probable result of this little
verbal eccentricity’, don’t you think?
“ Adoption as a fairy-tale means of sneaking into an
unborn somebody’’s inheritance isn't quite the rosy game
it used to be in the good old days. Mr. James Swan,
M.L.C., of Brisbane, who died at Suez (en route), the
other day’, left the whole of his self-made £25,0C0 to a
cold-water religious sect, provided they band over £SCO
a year for life to his young and disconsolate widow, but
never willed even the historical shilling to his adopted
daughter whom he made one of his family in 1860, or
thereabouts. Perhaps her marriage put her out of the
race—at any rate, the lady probably regards “ adoption ”
with a strong expression at present.
On dit, that at a recent “society” Sydney assembly
two ycung ladies were informed by the stewards that
unless they danced “in a different manner ” they would
be hustled into their wraps and sent homo. More of the
emancipation of women, probably. Man has hugged her
long enough in the waltz—now she is beginning to hug
him.
Melbourne is all agog over the “Japanese wedding’*
just now—the heroine of which is to be Miss Alice
Speight, a daughter of the Victorian Railway Coramis
sioner, and the bridegroom Mr. Baker, a widower. Miss
Speight set sail for Japan the other day with a costly
trousseau and cases of gifts, many’ of which were, I am
told, of very Yokohamaish character, foolishly enough, as
she will have quite enough of that sort of thing when she
gets there. By the way, Mr. “ Dick ” Speight is affianced
to Miss Fysh, daughter of the Tasmanian Premier. From
this it seems that the Speights don't find any (matri-
monial) prophets in (heir own country.
It did seem a reversal of things to see Bernhardt in
front at Her Majesty’s on Monday evening at the “ Merry
Wives of Windsor,” played in the usual soothing style by
Bill Rignold and brother George, assisted by the company.
There was a good house. Sara, accompanied by as many
people as could possibly crowd in whether invited or not,
occupied the vice-regal box, adorned with tri colour, not
plants, and a huge managerial corbeille, which balanced
on the box-ledge, while the stalls thought of putting up
umbrellas as a guarantee of good faith. “She” looked
fagged-out, but still charming, in a chrome-green velvet
and pale-pink chiffon gown, the high collar and front
edged with green feathers—two bunches of pink rose-
buds at neck and waist ; the long wrinkled gloves
to which she gives her name reaching past the
elbow, cream Manola cloak with the high gold
broidered collar lined with pink feathers. The liom ss
behaved quite rationally, clapping Harcourt ecsta'
tically for his Dr. Cains, because of the Frenchyness of the
part, and nursing a small child in a long frock which Dar-
mont brought to her for, a whole act, to the rapture cf the
galleryites, at whom Sara aimed a divine smile once o r
twice, as if she rather fancied the Australian gods. Du-
quesne, squatting on the floor of the box, fetched and
carried all the evening- first a cushion and then a fur-rugi
and a blonde masher faltered into The Presence with
much pantomime and a big bouquet, which Sara seized
by the centre in a way which must have hurt hisfeelings.
I couldn’t help feeling cruelly glad as Sara and the rest of
les belles frongsays appeared to be straining themselves
to know w’hat was going on on the stage—it was such a
quid pro quo. They tortured us with their lightning
French long enough—it was quite the boot on the other
foot.
At the close of the second act Handsome George, in the
picturesque heliotropie velvet suit of “Master Ford,’
stepped forth and speechified, asking for three cheers for
Bernhardt, which were shrieked with three cheers for
himself thrown in. Then the Marseillaise was played,
and everybody perpendicularised, and Darmont, standing
up beside Sara, sang the words in a boisterous baritone,
and somebody cried “ Hurroo ” from the gallery, and
Bernhardt undulated her thanks. In fact, there was
nearly as much irresponsible gush as on the last night at
the Royal, when people wept all over her dressing-room,
and George Anson (he speaks French) tripped in ahead
of several eager cavaliers and led Sara B. out to her
kerridge —Comus and Melpomene arm-in-arm.

Mrs. Alfred Devlin, of “ Clovelly,” Ashfield, has issued
cards for a ball, to be held at “ Clovelly,” on 261 h inst.
Lord and Lady Jersey will be present, on 15th inslant,
at the Intercolonial Sports Championship Meeting,
organised by the Sydney Harriers Club, to be held on the
Association Ground. It is to be hoped there won't be any
tykes on the cycle-track this time.
The Bal Masque at Cocgee Aquarium, on Slst ultimo,
was attended by about four hundred people, mostly in
fancy costumes. But a brace of South Sea Islanders, in
genuine “tappa” and “ sisi ” costumes, looked best
among the men. Only a few wore masks.
Some of the “democratic ratepayers” of Broken-hill
are prancing because the local mayor invited Gov. J. and
other itinerant vice-regalities to a banquet, paid for by
the town, and didn’t bid the whole community to the
feast, but made the turkey-struggle as “select” as
heaven. But the question is, does a real democrat ever
yearn to take a potato out of the same tureen as the
Governor?
Sydney' Reunions meet again at Nithsdale on 18th

A recent Southern engagement, between the daughter
of a Jewish money-lender and a furrin’ count, has a
distinctly Claude-Melnotte-ish “this- your-palace” air.
Let us hope the coilnt will be well-sifted before the lady
permits herself to become his “ counter.”
It is authoritatively stated that St. Vincent’s Ball toil*
take place this year as usual. The National Fair (not the
Arts and Science Exhibition, as previously stated), the
proceeds of which will go towards the building improve-
ment fund of the Hospital, will be opened by Lady Jersey
in the Centennial Hall on Slst inst. and will close on Bth
proximo.
This is the cold and halt-way month
When winter changes airs,
And the dry-goodsman without vain brag
Marks sixpence more on every rag
Of his “ sale-price ” counter wares.
This is the time when drapers nice
Push the moth-eaten bale,
And quote the old original price,
As “ such a reduction,” “ a sacrifice,”
And thus women crowd to the sale !

After giving 28 performances in Mel-
bourne seven in Adelaide, and 32 in Sydney, the
of’ Sara’s genius dipped beneath the Aus-
tralian theatrical horizon with a lurid glow that
resembled the iridescent gleam of her own
Titianesque looks. (N.8.-This is a feeble attempt
to emulate the soulful flapdoodle of the S.M.
Herald.) Bernhardt business, fading away at
Svduey Royal, came with a rattle during the last
three nights, and “Camille,” the closing repre-
sentation, was witnessed by a Large and
enthusiastic crowd who cheered themselves
hoarse at the end of every act—till the
scene-shifters must have got sick of hauling-up
and letting-down the curtain—while hurling on
flowers with an expedition and inaccuracy of
aim that betokened more zeal than discretion. At
the close, after three calls, the audience remained
at the request of James Cassius, and the curtain
being again drawn-up, Sara was seen surrounded
by her company and all the leading lights of the
Australian theatrical world. The band at the
rear struck up “The Marseillaise,” the French
flag was wildly waved from the proscenium
boxes, and the audimoe yelled wildly, while
half-a’-dozen gentlemen, including the handsome
Georges, Rignold and Anson, conveyed floral
tributes of fanciful design harps, crowns,
wreaths, ships, &c.—to the feet cf
world’s greatest dramatic genius. Trie
curtain was then lowered to allow Kowalski to get
ready for a bright little speech which he subse-
quently fired off with great effect, but the lowered
curtain had again to be drawn up in response to
unanimous appeals for Sara, which came from a
house that climbed up on seats and hung over
railings, regai’dless of appearances. It was nearly
twelve when proceedings terminated, and then
the “ God-given janius ” retired from the Royal
stage for the last time to her carriage, escorted by
the gallant Anson, who bore the belle away, ’mid
the frowns of her envious compatriots. She sailed
in the Mariposa on Tuesday.

Some excitement was caused at Her
Majesty’s during the later nights of “ Honest
Hearts and Horny Hands ” by the action of
Duncan B. Harrison, who came before the cur-
tain and condemned, in no measured terms, the
attitude espoused by the Sydney press towards
his show. Long ere the opening night, he
said, it had been prejudged and condemned.
One newspaper proprietor, averred Harrison,
had given his employes instructions to damn
it, because he had wagered £lOO that he
could ruin any American play that came along,
while the editor of another paper had
ordered his subordinates to cut it up without
mercy. These statements were received with
solemn silence from the house at the time, and by
the newspaper press subsequently. We trust, for
the sake of peace, that no act ; “n promoting
lawyers were present.

Sydney D.T. declares that “Jimmy”
Williamson’s good-natured accession to the request
of Sara, on the score of fatigue, to be absolved
from visiting Brisbane, cost her managers at least
£2OOO. Bosh ! It is scarcely likely that seven
performances at Brisbane would have realised a
greater sum than the £4OOO said to have been
taken during a similar period at Adelaide. Against
this amount may be set the time lost through, and
in, travel, say, six days, the transit expenses of
scenery and company, and the sum actually taken
in Sydney in the interval. Viewed without
reference to the coin that might have been taken
by the Opera Co., probably no greater sum than
what was taken by Bernhardt, it is certain that
the Brisbane trip would not have altered the
exchequer to the extent of one maravedi.
* # #
Now Sara has gone it will be easier to
estimate better, not only her worth, but that, in a
lesser degree, of her company. For herself, who
will ever forget the soul-stirring pathos of the
cry “Armand !” as the returned lover approaches
her death-bed ; her anguish of feature, gesture,
and voice as Tosca in the torture scene ; the snarl,
like that of a cornered dog, with which she
strikes down Scarpia in the succeeding scene, and
all the wonderful details that precede her weird,
panther-like exit from the chamber of horrors, lit
up only by the death-candles that glimmer feebly
in the pallid dawn ? As for the company : None
have claim to any absolute excellence, but all are
artists, aiming, not at individual distinction, but
at general ensemble. As an instance in point,
the messenger, with a one-line speech, who
delivers Marguerite’s letter to Armand in the
cottage retreat. One thing about Sara is notice-
able, her performances are never mechanical or
stereotyped. She never played Camille or Floria
Tosca, during her Sydney stay, in exactly the
same fashion. Broadly speaking, of course, the
performance was the same, but in little things it
differed, in bye-play, in stage movements, in the
emphasis of trifling phrases, and so on.

“The Profligate’s ” sowing of wild oats is
said to have been reaping a fat harvest at the
pay-boxes of Sydney Garrick. Consequently, he
continues to flood the auditorium with moral
aphorisms and tears until Saturday night, when
“ The Idler ” follows. “ The Profligate ” will be
played for the last time on the afternoon of that
day. “ A Scrap of Paper ” is said to be in
rehearsal.

Despite the fact that admission to the
gallery was two shillings, a house, crowded in
every part, greeted with tumultuous applause the
return of Billy Elton, Charles Ryley, the “tiny-
tots,” and Henry Bracy with the Opera Co., at
Sydney Royal, on Monday last. “ Old Guard,”
musically considered, is a feeble “Paul Jonesy ”
rehash, with an ill-developed plot and no situa-
tions worth speaking off. It only contains one
character, thePolydore of Elton, that is not afeeble
replica of some type we've seen hundreds of times.
All the others are simply silhouettes, dim outlines
of old, worn-out stereos, that have neither height,
breadth, depth, nor rotundity. Therefore is
Elton, as was Arthur Roberts, at London Avenue
three years ago, the whole show and the dog
under the waggon. “ Old Guard ” is fairly well-
dressed, well-scened, thanks to Goatcher and
Brunton, and its orchestration is excellent. So is
the stage-drilling, though, bar the Fin-de-Siefe
ballet —for whose arrangement Marie Reddall
took a weU-deserved call on opening night—
there is little dancing and less marching.
The “opera” needs a heap of building-up,
and Elton—made up cranially to resemble “Bill
Nye”— not only lays the bricks, but carries the
hod, albeit his magnificent vocal organ was a
little husky on the premiere. Ida Osborne has
seceded, and her place is filled by Julia Loel, a
young lady of pleasing presence, with a mezzo-
soprano of good quality, but wanting in smooth-
ness and flexibility. Alongside her, Florence
Young, much-improved, appears a capable actress.
Several numbers have caught on, particularly
Elton’s “Dashing Militaire,” Ryley’s “When
Thou Art Near,” an introduced song composed by
Conductor Caron, and “Farewell, my Humble
Home,” sung with much taste by Julia Loel.
se * * *
It is a long leap from Harrison and John
L. Sullivan to Shakespeare and Bill Rignold, but
Sydney Her Majesty’s Co. cleared the chasm on
Monday night, without straining anything. The
“Merry Wives” is played by the original cast,
except in the case of Master Slender, whose gar-
ments are now filled by Mr. Ivimey, a feeble copy
of Harry Hoyte, their previous wearer. William
Rignold’s fat knight has even gained in breadth
and unctuousness with age and sea-voyaging,
and Ford, played by Brother George contrary
to report, is of its old-time excellence.
Messrs, Jewett, Harcourt, Sweeney, Greena-
way Burford, Hazlitt, Whyte, Rigby, and
the Misses Bishop, Watts-Phillips, Rignold,
and Tracey repeat former successes, and the only
leading feature not up to the mark of twelve
months past is the fairy dance of the last act.
Madame Bernhardt, some of her company, and a
few hard-shelled social limpets were in and around
the vice-regal box all through on Monday night,
and applauded throughout right lustily. Between
acts G. R. came ,to the front and called on the
house to arise and cheer, with might and main,
the great woman. After everybody had
responded, the band struck up the Marseillaise,
in which everybody, including Sara and Darmont,
joined with Gallic energy and enthusiasm. Thus
was ushered in the “Merry Wives’ ” revival, thus
closed Sara’s last night in Australia.
* * *
When a critic is on cheek-kissing-terms
with a great actress, what sort of criticism can
you reasonably expect? You can easily see that
Nugent Robertson never kissed Sara.

Madame Simonsen’s new Italian Opera
Company opened the attack at Melbourne
Alexandra on Saturday night. With fashion
fully represented in the dress-circle, crowded
stalls, every inch of standing space occupied in
the old shilling pit, and a gallery well nigh loaded,
the appearance of the house—cleaned and done up
for the occasion—was an entertainment in itself.
Moreover, the display of musical enthusiasm
almost equalled the furore of four-and-a-half years
ago, when the first Simonsen company sang the
same opera on the same boards. Saturday’s per-
formance of “II Trovatore ’’ was in some respects
superior to the one by which it was judged,
though, perhaps, less satisfying to the average
unculchawed listener, who mostly swears by the
soprano’s solos, and is easily taken captive by a
tenor’s top-note. Right away it became evident
that Napoleone Maffezzol, the conductor, is a
first-class general, able to make the very most of
a sufficiently large orchestra, and especially strong
in his control of a limited chorus. Such a sharp,
clean, neat rendering of the opera throughout
has probably not been heard before in Melbourne.
It was a credit to the chorus-master and a genuine
triumph for the commander-in-chief, who, by the
way, put things through with an air of
composure that is far from being the badge
of all his tribe. The principals—as many
of them, at least, as showed on Satur-
day—run strictly on traditional lines. The
prima-donna, Guidotti, weighs a few stone more
than her tenor adorer, Signor Vilalta, whilst the
jealous baritone of the evening, Signor Sisco,
wears hair all round his face, and could also sit on
the tenor if the plot of the narrative gave him a
chance. The baritone’s white cloak (a preposter-
ously thin and raggy garment), the tenor’s
humiliating helmet, and the soprano’s tragic black
dress are just what was expected, also the way in
which they all rush up and down the stage or bolt
off at a certain given bar of music are pathetic
reminders of the dead, dim past. Their readiness
to come forward and bow acknowledgements in the
middle of a supreme moment of passion is another
well-remembered feature of the lyric drama. In
fact, the general resemblance between the event of
Saturday last and its Alexandra original was as
striking as the likeness which one yard of
maccaroni bears to another 36 inches of that
. farinaceous food. The reappearance of Cavalleri
as the gipsy assisted to make many of theaudience
feel a few years younger. Time has improved the
fine contralto voice of Signorina 0., besides
giving another touch of power to her
always efficient playing of the part. Sisco
is a good melodious baritone with a more
free, easy, and accessible sort of walk than his
predecessor, Pirnazzoni, whom he otherwise re-
sembles. lorio, the basso, seems promising, and
two or three subordinate characters throw off their
little bits of warble like artists. Signorina Gui-
dotti is a nice-faced, buxom prima-donna and
emotional actress, with a high, forced soprano,
less powerful than Ciuti’s was, but more sym-
pathetic in the middle notes. The other lady,
without question, could shriek to greater advan-
tage in the concerted numbers. Vilalta is merely
a good specimen of the average Italian tenor who,
strictly speaking, doesn’t sing tenor at all. Vil-
alta pumps up a metallic flow of falsetto, which
s in tune without being melodious. However,
his voice, although sadly unsympathetic and
strained, will probably be found to wear well, and
it certainly attains to a high altitude in its own
weird, peculiar way. Should several other artists
(who were to appear in public ere this) turn out
superior to the first samples it is very likely that
the season will boom. Melossi, a baritone of big
repute, was due as the Count di Luna on Tuesday,
together with a second basso. On Wednesday
and Thursday (to-night) the “ star,” Signora Cut-
tica, appears with her tenor husband in “Martha.”
If the Signora’s voice is anyway sweet, “Martha”
ought to knock ’em, for concerning the lady’s
vocal powers there is said to be no possible doubt
whatever.
& » * W
At the Opera House they were to close the
“County Fair” after Tuesday, and shunt that
dreadful, noisy machine which used to work Cold
Molasses first past the post by a short nose. For
the three following nights the theatre remains
closed, in order that the eminent fighter-actor,
J. L. Sullivan, may be put into rehearsal and pro-
duced in something like a common-sense manner
on Saturday next (15th). It is rumoured and
hoped that the village blacksmith will not sport
evening dress to make a horseshoe in.

“ Miss Laura Yilliers and her entire com-
pany from London ” are beginning to look very
lonesome-like amidst the regilded vastness of
Melbourne Royal. Even with the adventitious
aid of a newspaper-controversy, it was found
impossible to prop up “ The Dancing Girl ” for a
third week, and on Saturday that badly-treated
nymph, likewise the dear dook and his humorous
auntie, took themselves off in favour of a double
bill, “We Two” and “ Woodbarrow Farm.”
Seeing that the public showed little desire to
back the double bill, and seeing furthermore that
it wasn’t accepted with much gusto, the reason
why Miss Yilliers and Co. don’t give themselves
up as a bad job will soon require as much finding
as the North Pole. In “ The Dancing Girl ” they
fell below expectation with a sickening thud,
and the change of programme leaves them
gasping for appreciation on the old level. They
haven’t come to fill a vacuum, or supply a long-
felt want in Australia. In point of superfluous-
ness, these well-meaning strangers may be com-
pared to a sack of coke at Newcastle, and the
question of what on earth to do with ’em cries
aloud for thoughtful consideration by the Royal
proprietary. The managing-director and friends
ought to form a glee-party behind the scenes, and
sing “ Laura, dear Laura, go. ‘home’ with you
now.” If the lady persists in carrying out her
engagement after that, then they ought to per-
suade her to play something with an American
novelty in it, and give the Hairless Horse from
the Waxworks a leading character. The spectacle
of that unfledged beast of burden romping to
victory in a mechanical race would draw good
money.
* * * *
“ We Two ” is a weak one-act yarn, show-
ing how Miss Yilliers and Clifton Anderson are
drifting apart, or something, mainly in conse-
quence of A If. Boothman, who invades their
domestic circle in tan shoes and an ulster. For-
tunately an old family butler forgets to do some-
thing, or does something which he had forgotten,
after which the clouds roll by, and Boothman’s
tan shoes never darken the other people’s door
again. Anyway, it all comes right, whereas the
acting manages to go a trifle wrong throughout.
The effect produced is a yawn. “Woodbarrow
Farm,” by Jerome K, Jerome, seems a bright
little play, containing many smart lines, two or
more well-sketched conventional characters, and
at least one striking incident. A man who pre-
tends to be somebody else drops dead, and the
real person, who was intended to be murdered,
turns up unexpectedly and is identified as his
buried impersonator. Meantime a noble-hearted
yokel has come into the property by mistake and
been mashed by the wife of the necessary
villain, and when he refuses, for the sake
of his unfortunate attachment, to assist the
man that wasn’t killed in securing the villain,
there is nothing left for the noble yokel
but to return to Woodbarrow Farm and settle
down for good on three acres and a cow. The
drama ends in peaceful smoke, and would not take
the town’s breath away even if it were produced
with a B. and B. cast. Under present conditions
it gives a fairly interesting idea of how much
better the Farm might be worked. Julius
Knight doesn’t carry quite enough guns for the
trying part of the suddenly-enriched country-
man, whilst Miss Yilliers, rather attractively
made-up, again proves that she lacks force and
feeling, rather than experience. Percival Stevens
(the company are great in stage names), who
appeared as Mr. Crake in the withdrawn piece,
makes something of his opportunities in this
instance. The rest are either a little livelier, or
else no better, than they gave promise of being
at the outset of their Australian careers. No-
body, in fact, gets near to revealing any unsus-
pected talent, but Brunton’s scenery is cleverly
performed as usual.

The market for Gaiety burlesque remains
firm, and buyers flocked to the Princess’ again
last week. *“Ruy Bias,” however, must posi-
tively draw its gorgeous inanity to a close on
Saturday night, because “ Cinder-Ellen ” will be
ready to kick up her volatile legs on the Monday
following (17th). Sunday, of course, is always set
apart by the Gaiety Company for prayer and
thanksgiving,
* * * *
“Peril,” at Melbourne Bijou, is
liked, especially by the local aristocracy, who
come in glittering relays of theatre-parties to see
the naughty capting chivvy Lady Ormond round
the coal-scuttle. Perhaps they heave a sigh of
disappointment when that virtuous enigma closes
the shutters between herself and the capting with
the pious ejaculation that she is “safe!” but
sassiety must admit that the shutters are a satis-
factory solution of the difficulty. The farcical
comedy incidents sail along a rippling sea of
laughter, and if “ Peril ” were more robustly built
and had a sterner purpose it would fill the pretty
house for a long time. It runs over Saturday pre-
sumably.

Halle concerts, despite the excited shrieks
of musical critics, are not in great request at the
Town Hall, although programmes are now
generally described as “ popular ” in the advertise-
ments. The famous artists take a last grand final
farewell on Monday next when a crowded audience
might be expected but for the fact that Halle
farewells seem to come round pretty often.

Frank Clark & Co. flourish at the Gaiety,
also the Vic. pegs along quietly. The Waxworks
is still located at the old spot and the Oyclorama
promises to exchange “Waterloo” for a new
subject—“ Eureka Stockade ” —in a week or two.
Fortunately the Gillies Government is “out,”
otherwise Wrixon would have brought in a bill to
suppress “ Eureka ” on account of its disloyalty tc
the Crown, or something.

The substitution of “ Les Cloches de
Corneville ” for “Bridget O’Brien, Esq.,” at the
Adelaide Boyal, by the Sheridan combination,
has been admittedly a failure. Talented as the
great J. F.’s company are in their own little line,
they are off-colour in opera. Warwick Gainor,
with his robust organ, was, in tome respects, one
redeeming feature of the production, and although
Jules Simonsen sang prettily, he wanted life and
finish. Johnny Sheridan’s make-up as Gaspard
was complete and ghastly enough, but here
remarks should cease. “Fun on the Bristol ”is
being restored to bring matters round. Then, on
the 14th and 15th, Adelaide will be engaged in
discussing a new drama, “The Jonquil,” by a
local author-actor (Mr. Guy Boothby). Wybert
Reeve takes the responsibility of the production,
which will be interpreted by amateurs, assisted
by Harry Norman as coach and stage-manager.

The Achurch-Charrington crowd did re
markable business at Broken Hill, opening with
“ Forget Me Not,” and changing to “Camille,”
“ Doll’s House,” &c. They were assisted by the
presence in the silver city of Lords Jersey and
Kintore, and the enthusiasm of the inhabitants
over a copious rainfall, and the Theatre Royal was
densely packed every night.
At Poverty Point.
Patti seeks £1000 a night from Abbey and Grau for an

A posse of police the other night, about 12 o’clock,
raided a hotel adjoining one of Sydney’s leading theatres,
and there surprised a crowd of the “ boys.” Included
therein were several popular actors, whose wit suggested
some fun at the expense of the others. As the latter
entered, the “accusedat the bar' all commenced jabber-
ing in alleged French, and, on being asked for their
names, gave a long string of Gallic titles. The whole
family of Duval (Claude, Armand, and several others)
were represented, several Comtes were included in the
gang, but the joke reached its climax when a Thespian,
recognised everywhere by his Falstafflan proportions,
returned his baptismal cognomen as Alphonse Pierre
Jean Jaques Le Blanc. Nothing has since eventuated.
During her Australian season Sara Bernhardt got a
cheque for £100 every morning at breakfast and £200 on
any day on which a matinee occured. Nor was this the
whole of her remuneration. It was, by the way, Sara’s fad
to pay her hotel-bill every day—nine guineas.
On Bernhardt’s last Sydney Royal night a souvenir
sheet of music, styled “ Pensee,” was given to every lady
in the house. The music was by Georges Charton, one of
the company, and the words composed by Sara, on board
the Monowai, run thus
On devrait vivre pour aimer et
Mourir de ne plus aimer.
In other words—
We ought to live to love and die,
Not loving any more.
Major Henry C. Dane, the lately-wedded and favourably-

The very latest about Melba:—“The cloak worn by-
Melba when she appeared as Elsa in ‘ Lohengrin ’ excited
the greatest possible admiration. It was made by M
Worth, and is looked upon as quite a chef d’ oeuvre , The
material is cloth of gold, with fleurs-de-lis embroidered
upon it in white. The border, which is also white, is
thickly studded with pearls, rubies and emeralds. It is
immensely heavy, and two stout pages Svere put on by-
Mr. Harris to carry the train of this gorgeous garment in
the wedding scene ; but, in spite of the two bearers, the
movements of Madame Melba were much impeded as she
moved about the stage.” What a tail our cat has got!
A benefit to Johnny Wallace, the immortal Bambini,
will be arranged in Melbourne directly the heads of the
perfesh come forward with their vote and interest, say ing
“ We are here, dear Duke.” Johnny wants a benefit
badly, they say.
Each individual of the new company at Melbourne
Royal appears to consider that the others are weak— very
weak.
The most astounding thing in the last Melbourne opera
season was when Madame Ciuti was taken ill and could
not play Valentine, in the “Huguenots,” whereupon
Madame Simonsen went through it splendidly, without a
rehearsal, never having done it before.
A “ Professor ” Hoffman, described as “ the greatest
prestidigi-comedian and ventriloquist of the world,” has
been fooling them in Newtown (M.L.) with the prize-
distribution fake.
It took a two-horse carriage to convey Sara’s floral
trophies to the Australia after her farewell performance,
Sara Bernhardt, it is said, is so well pleased with her
bust as executed by E. B. Mackennal, the young Austra-
lian sculptor, that she intends to have it reproduced in
marble, bronze and silver.
Says S.M. Herald of Dr. M’Carthy’s portrait of Sara
Bernhardt as Cleopatra; “The head thrown hack with
regnant grace, whilst the blue eyes, suffused with a love-
look of languid, voluptuous expectancy, gaze rapturously
forward, is instinct with the spirit of the character as
represented by Mine. Bernhardt. The warm carnations of
the cheek and the ruddy gleaming of the fair nut-brown
hair, with the rich yellow of the loose robe relieved by the
heliotrope colour of the jewelled sash, give, in their pro-
fusion of harmonious tints, the required suggestion of the
‘ gorgeous East.’ ” Have all the Herald staff kissed Sara
goodbye ?
What caused all the trouble in the swell concert-com-
pany was the fact that the handsome soprano was guilty
of the unpardonable sin of dressing better and looking
better than her gifted female boss. That story about the
missing trunks is declared to be all flam.
The Alexandra, Melbourne, looks fresh and beautiful in
its new decorations, and electric-light now triumphs at
all the Melbourne plays. Poor Joubert! one says again —
the man who furnished Melbourne with its best theatre,
at the date of its completion, and now it pays as well as
any.
Little Simonsen has gone under—under petticoat guv—
because he made so small a success of his last trip to
Europe, wherefore the gifted missus clutches the reins. He
will just be allowed a little fiddle solo, between the acts.
Maffezzoli, Madame Simonsen’s conductor, is charmed
with the orchestra of 35, gathered for him in Melbourne,
and Harcourt Lee has drilled the chorus. Never had
opera in Australia such a band, the cream of the training
by Cowen and Hamilton Clarke, not to speak of such
enthusiasts, in the past, as Hazon, Zelman, Siede, and
Giorza.

In the race between monarchies and

Melbourne Age says that “ M‘Millan’s
abandonment of office at this particular juncture
is viewed as a piece of political cowardice.”
“In politics there is nothing meaner than
to steal without acknowledgment, because the
loser has no redress except public opinion.”—
Reynolds.
Premier Munro says that the Victorian
Government railways have sponged on revenue to
the extent of nine millions sterling over and
above loan-moneys.
The S.A. Ministry are trying to institute
single electorates; all nominations and elections

The same crowd who put in MTlwraith

“ Steadfast loyalty to the British Crown is

The National Observer, referring to
Lord Salisbury’s African annexations, says “his
achievement is all the more grateful in that it has
been largely bloodless.” Which seems a gentle
substitute for slightly bloody.
There are only 1800 Jews in all Ireland.

arrested in London for stealing; “I am not a
thief; I am a Socialist. He is not a thief who,
when workless and necessitous, only takes that of
which he is in need : he only is a thief who,
having enough, takes more.”
The nomadic vote might be taken in N.S.
Wales, it has been suggested, not by transference
of the electoral right to fresh divisions and dis-
tricts, but as in S.A. and Queensland (in the elec-
tion of Divisional Boards under the Local
Government Act) by the transmission of ballot-
papers through the post.
The O'Sullivan, M.L.A., declares that he
obstructs Neild’s Divorce Bill “ on behalf of the
women of N.S. Wales.” On behalf of that section
only whose religion deprives them of the moral,
social, and political right to seek and obtain
divorce when marriage ties are a source of moral,
physical, or intellectual misery.
If the whole of N.S.W. were converted
into one electorate at present, as proposed by some
speakers, with 141 members to be elected out of
perhaps 500 candidates, the returning-officer would
have a lovely task in running down the list to
point out to the illiterate voter the 141 members
whom the latter particularly wished to elect.
M‘Millan’s backers assert that he has paid
off the Dibbs deficit. Yes, in the good old
Parkesian way—-with Treasury bills, or 1.0.U.’5,
not one of which has yet been redeemed. The
deficit still exists. The N.S.W. Treasury is
merely in pawn. We could wipe out all the
national debts in the world ourselves, in that
fashion.
Jawbone Neild proposes by bill in the
N.S.W. Parliament that the holder of every lease
of landed property having a minimum unexpired
currency of 50 years shall be entitled to buy the
fee-simple upon tendering to the owner a sum
equal to 20 years rent, and that he shall have an
action for damages in the event of the owner’s
refusal to surrender the title.
It is suggested that electors be paid £5
apiece to record their votes, so as to induce all, or
nearly all, voters to exercise their right of fran-
chise. The argument is : You pay members for
legislating; why not pay voters for enabling mem-
bers to legislate? The difference is that the man
who votes is only minding his own business ; the
member is minding other people’s.
Attention is again being called to the
N.S.W. State pension-list of £50,000 a year. At
one end thereof are two ex-judges (£2620 and
£lB2O annual pension respectively), who for long
ENVY.
UNEMPLOYED: “Do they git that often?”
KEEPER: Reg’lar, twice a day.”
UNEMPLOYED: “Ah ! I wish I could git a billet ’ere as a wild beast!”
years enjoyed fat salaries; at the other is the
poor woman who gets £l5 annually for the loss of
her husband, murdered by a highwayman. Surely
some highwayman hath constructed such a pen-
sion-list.
Personal registration of votes should be
supplemented by house-to-house canvas by the
electoral officers’ delegates, and, as has been sug-
gested in the N.S.W. Assembly, public interest
and enthusiasm might be awakened by having
public days of registration. Registration, aye,
and voting, might just as equitably be made com-
pulsory as the registration of births, deaths, and
marriages.
Premier Munro has sent a mi]d protest to
the Indian Government against the influx of our
beloved fellow-subjects, the Indian hawkers, who
roll their kincob eyes so ferociously when a woman
whose husband is out won’t buy But, of course,
in the grand United Empire Ghollah and Chunder
have a right to swarm here by the million. Vic-
torian General Tulloch will tell you how vital
Herat is to Australia.
Copeland, M.L.A. (N.S.W.), objects to
the abolition of the £4O Parliamentary nomination
deposit on the ground that it prevents vexatious
candidature. It does, the vexatious candidature
of the poor man only, for a £4O or £lOOO deposit
cannot prevent the vexatious candidature of the
rich man or his dummy. Monetary deposits in
cases of candidature are simply weapons in the
hands of property-holders.
Premier Munro’s abstention from pro-
posing fresh taxation euchres even the astute
Gillies. Munro absolutely courts a defeat in
Parliament, because a defeat means a dissolution.
And what would Gillies do then, poor thing ? It
would kill him politically to denounce Munro for
not taxing Victorians some more. Gillies yearned
to hear Munro’s budget, in the certain faith that
it would bristle with new taxes.
The present attitude of the Irish priests
towards Parnell reminds The Bulletin of the old
story told of Murphy, who got very “screwed”
one evening at the house of his life-long friend
Flannigan. “ Luk here, Flannigan,” said Murphy
in an outburst of drunken confidence, “ we’ve
been frinds — [hie) —for thirty-siven year, but (con-
fidentially) Oi’ve niver raley liked you, Flanni-
gan.” The Irish hierarchy has gammoned a lot,
but it has never liked Flannigan Parnell.
The Commonwealth Bill is being shunted
by the Tasmanian Parliament to a Federal Con-
vention, consisting of 50 members, elected by the
parliamentary voters. This Convention, to which
members of Parliament may be elected, will be
empowered by statute to consider, and amend, if
necessary, the great measure, which Parkes told
the open-mouthed people of Hobart must not be
touched—not a line or a comma of it.
Scores of workmen want employment in
the Richmond (N.S.W.) district, and along come
a crowd of newchum Austrians who are ready to
sink dams for 10s. a week and food. Scores of
able-bodied workmen are wandering about the
Johnstone River (N.Q.) country, and down come
boatloads of Chinamen from further North who are
eagerly engaged at sweated wages. The Chow has
not yet been half edged out of Australia.
The N.S.W. Cabinet are blowing very cold
on the creation of a Labour Department, now that
they have secured the Labour-party’s support. If
a Department of Agriculture can be created ille-
gally by a Parkes Cabinet, with the tacit conni-
vance of Parliament, why cannot a Department
of Labour be instituted without the passing of a
special bill ? Parkes can be counted on to act
“ hutterly hunconstitutionally if in want of
parliamentary support.
Sydney Echo proclaims in favour of
enfranchising propertied women— which, of course,
would be merely wealth. The
Bulletin wants to know what is "wrong with its
proposal that woman-franchise should first be tried
by enfranchising red-headed women, of whom
some have property and some have not ? As there
are many red-headed Scotchmen, there are, no
doubt, lots of red-headed Scotchwomen. Tims
the Echo’s clientele would get a fair deal.
Kaiser Wilhelm says he will drink no more
wine until he drinks it in France. Wilhelm may
intend a lot, but his threat may not mean much,
after all, Napoleon 111. drank German wine in
Germany—as a prisoner. Wilhelm may yet drink
French wine as an exile enjoying the hospitality
and protection of the Republic. During the Ger-
man occupation of Champagne after the war a
French peasant sowing seeds in a field was jeered
at by a half-tipsy German who said : “ You sow ;
but the crop will be ours.” “That may be so,”
said the Frenchman, “ I am planting hemp.”
In the N.S.W. elections, a defeated Oppo-
sitionist was deprived of his railway-pass within
24 hours of his defeat; while a defeated Minis-
terialist was allowed to continue to travel “on
the nod,” both of them looking for another seat.
The Oppositionist won a seat in the Never Never
country, and the Ministerialist, after being de-
feated a second time, had to pass in his railway-
pass. The question now is—Should the former be
refunded his fares to Bourke, or should the latter
be called on to pay for his free trips out West ?
And a second question is—Are the railways
managed on political aa well aa on commercial
principles ?
Premier Parkes, haring stated in N S.W,
Assembly that he favoured what was styled over-
representation, because it did away with
cliqueism, provided the friction of many minds,
and thus aroused an enthusiasm which sought and
found expression in high-class oral utterance,
Mr. Crick: “Deniehy made some of the best
speeches ever heard in this Chamber to a House of
thirty members.” Parkes; “I fear the lion,
member will endanger his reputation by speaking
in such terms of speeches he never heard.”
Crick: “I never heard Cicero, but I believe he
was very good. ”
N.S. Wales pays dearly for the services of
“Prime Minister” Parkes. The Sobraon pur-
chase, for instance, is the latest specimen of his
blundering. The ship cost £ll,OOO, and the
fittings will probably cost another £ll,OOO. It is
stated on Imperial authority that but for Parkes’
churlishness the province would have been pre-
sented with the training-ship, Shah, at a saving
of many thousands to the taxpayers. The offer
emanated from the Admiralty; but probably it
reached Parkes when he was busy with his Federa-
tion fad. The Agent-General’s cablegrams ought
to be moved for.
Parkes’ Electoral Bill, if passed as thrown
together, would not give the franchise to the
shearers and the seamen, and would take the
suffrage away from every man who could not read
and write ! The Bill is a disgrace to even Parkes,
and the man who operated the scissors and paste
on his behalf merits a stern reproof. Every Elec-
toral Act in the Australias has been liberally
drawn on to compile another of Parkes’ “great
measures.” The work has been done so badly,
that the closest possible scrutiny will be required
to see that the machinery of the Bill does give a
vote to every citizen, whether literate or illiterate,
stationary or nomadic.
Wilkinson, an obscure M.L.A. (Vic.), died
last week, and the House lost an evening. With-
out being unkind, the democrat must protest
against this sort of thing, and chiefly because it is
a kind of assertion of a corporate spirit in Parlia-
ment, inimical to the view of delegation. Besides,
the system is hypocritical. No one in Parliament
really grieved, as a member of Parliament, over
Wilkinson’s death. They looked at the matter as
calmly as did the surgeon who, scraping with his
knife the heart of his dead friend, said —“ Ah, it
is lime that kills us ! ”
With the advent of the British Parliamen-
tary Labour-party, the Daily Chronicle, the
only London morning paper with really demo-
cratic leanings, has the ball at its foot. From the
Times, Standard, and Post the unprivileged
classes can expect nothing; they can hope for even
less at the hands of that truculent organ of an
execrably venal and creasy bourgeoisie, Levy’s
Daily Telegraph. The Daily News is the
“official Liberal” paper, and the wage-earners
know by now of what the Liberalism of upper
Civil Servants consists. Before the Chronicle,
which has a clean record and is owned by
wealthy men who seem to live in more than a
glimmer of democratic light, now lies the most
glorious chance in the world’s journalism.
Victoria pays its money and takes its
choice between the legislative opinions of two
sapient Scotchmen —M‘Call and Jock Nimmaw.
M'Coll affirms that the admission of Maoriland
into the Federation scheme would weaken the
position from a defence point of view by reason
of the long distance separating that country from
Australia. And anon old Jock rises to protest
that it would be a great advantage for Maoriland
to come into the Federation from a defence point
of view, for she would form a very dangerous
base for the operations of a foreign foe. Mean-
time the question of how any foreign foe can pos-
sibly take possession of Maoriland remains ridi-
culously open.
A writer in the S.M. Herald, in re
woman-suffrage, puts it thus :
In a civilised State, not the man Or the Individual adult,
male or female, is the unit of society. The family is the
Unit of civilised . . . society, and the enfranchise-
ment of families only will give representation to women
without endangering the sanctity and unity of family life.
This should be favoured by women, tor it will be a pre-
mium on marriage. The married are the most trust-
worthy members of society. The single furnish most of
the criminal. . . . The larger the number of married
in the State the better the morals, is most obvious. So
long as young men remained in their parental homes they
could have their share of influence in the political counsels
pf the family. The widowed mother would then vote as
the head of the family, and the sons and daughters, when
they gave hostages to fortune by marrying, would then
have the right to a family franchise. This is the only way
to prevent society from becoming socially disintegrated
by individual political rights being given to all adults.
England is about as funny a Freetracle
country as is New South Wales—or Victoria. It
only applies Frectrade to foodstuffs which it can-
not itself grow, but most consistently doses its
manufactures with Protection. Duties, more or
less heavy, are on—ale and beer, ammunition,
arms, books, butter, candles, cheese, chinaware,
cottons, some descriptions of earthenware, em-
broidery and needlework, ostrich feathers, &c.,
artificial flowers, hair manufactures, iron and
steel goods, opera-glasses, paper, pewter goods,
leather goods, dressed rice, silks, spirits, tallow,
tin, watches, wines, woods (with exceptions), and
woollens. It cannot be argued that these selected
items form any portion of merely revenue-raising
duties; they evince a studied discrimination to
protect manufactures already in vogue in that
alleged Freetrade country.
Gov. Kintore wants the Northern Territory
to be separated from South Australia. This must
come under a Federal Government, but here is
Kintore’s reason ■
. . . How possible it is to look for satisfactory legis-
lation by a Parliament 2000 miles distant, and composed
of gentlemen mainly ignorant of the conditions of
tropical life, and who are swayed by constituencies having
little interest in, or prejudiced against, the methods and
management of tropical colonies.
What about the alternative? A Crown colony
governed not J2OOO miles away but 16,000! That
is what Kintore wants, and presumably it is what
the Imperial Government wants if, as he says,
Kintore was sent across Australia in Imperial
interests !

Gladstone held a unique position at the

Sir William Gordon-Cumming is of the
bluest of blue blood. He is of the blood of Robert
Comyn to whom the Conqueror, in the third year
of his reign, gave the earldom of Northumberland,
and he is of the race of Comyn of Badenoch, men
of stainless honour: one of whom, John Comyn,
claimed the throne of Scotland, and whose two
sons, John and Roger, were both murdered by
Robert Bruce. And the blood of Bruce, as well,
now flows in the veins of Sir William Gumming
through his ancestress, Lucy Gordon, the lineal
descendant of Princess Margaret of Scotland,
through whom he represents the premier Baronets
of that country. And he also represents an
ancient West of England family, Penrose of Pen-
rose, in Cornwall, settled there before the
Conquest.
Colston, the Narbethong murderer, has
left his brain to the doctors, in the hope that it
will enable them to settle the question of his
sanity. Now, a man may have been as mad as a
hatter and yet his brain may show no recognisable
signs of disease. “I have examined over 2000
brains,” we once heard Dr. Neild say, “and yet I
know nothing.” Apropos. Two men, both said
to be shamming madness, were confined in a
southern N.S.W. gaol a few years ago. One, in
an access of rage had chopped down a boy who
had thrown stones at his hut, and was awaiting
execution ; the other had been convicted of horse-
stealing. A medical commission reported both
sane, and the homicide was hanged. The horse-
thief broke gaol and drowned himself in the local
river. A local surgeon opened his skull and found
in his brain a walnut-sized tumour. Yet that
thief may not have been half so mad as the
murderer, in whose brain no disease could be
recognised post-mortem.

One of Disraeli’s friends, Sir William
Eraser, has published a biography of the old,
glaring, garish Hebrew, and the result ought to
knock Primrose Leagueism on the head for good
and all. Disraeli, according to this authority,
doesn’t look like good material to build a Primrose
League upon. He didn’t care for primroses, which
was already well-known, or for flowers of any
kind, or for poetry or scenery, but he had the
Hebrew weakness for glaring at red and blue and
yellow furniture, and his tastes in upholstery were
loud enough to alarm the whole neighborhood,
He was addicted to green velvet pants when he
was young, and shrieking brass jewellery; and
when he was old he had black velvet waistcoats
and howling gold chains instead. He wore big
rings outside his gloves and had a little curl that
hung down about the middle of his forehead. It
looked as if it had been left loose through haste or
negligence, but Disraeli struggled with it for
years'before he got it to hang right. He had the
most successful hair-dye in Europe—in fact, it is
supposed that he made it himself secretly in the
dead of night. He was always oily and more or

W AKLoH Hie literary man of the

Pastoralists’ Union, for the Upper Hunter, when
shearing was always in the front rank in uphold-
ing the rights of his guild. He was once working
on a back-country station where the boss (the
well-known Mr. C ) attempted to work off ram-
stags upon the shearers as mutton. The boys
grumbled, but no notice was taken, so the gentle
Thomas was deputed to wait upon the boss and
inform him that unless decent mutton were forth-
coming all hands would leave. The boss stormed
and raved, but finally had to give in on the mutton
question. This was before there was any Union,
and though the price was 20s. per hundred, all
shearers had to agree to be paid off at 15s. if dis-
charged before completion of shearing. Within
one day of the close of shearing Williams and
some others who had spoken their minds pretty
freely on the ram-stag business were “sacked,” and
informed that they would be paid off at 15s. per
100. The other shearers were indignant, but
could do nothing, as the manager had enough
boundary-riders on the station to finish the few
sheep still unshorn, and would have smilingly
paid all hands off at 15s. had they struck. Tom
got his own and mates’ horses up out of the pad-
dock, put their packs on, and then coolly strolled
up to the office with a heavy green-hide riding-
whip in his hand for a settlement. The kind
employer had the accounts made up at 15s. per
100. “Now, Mr. C ,”said Williams, “don’t
let us waste time. It is 25 miles to the nearest
police-station, assistance cannot possibly arrive
from there under five hours, and the shearers will
take great care that no one on the station will
come to your assistance. You’ll either pay me
and my mates in full for the sheep we have shorn,
or I’ll flog you as long as this whip hangs
together.” They got their money in full.
Samuel Vincent Winter has severed his
connection with Melbourne Evening Herald.
He can stand a great deal, can our old boss, and
has served a severe apprenticeship to a variety of
swipy reporters and maudlin compositors. But
then, he has always been able to get off his disgust
when annoyed, by giving forth strong language,
in a broad, gusty, Benbow fashion. This has
saved him from premature apoplexy. Now, how-
ever, even this resource, or palliative, is denied
him. The Herald has passed into the hands of
a syndicate of blue Presbyterians; God-fearing
men, who walk the narrow path of righteousness,
.and know not the comfort of a good, full-bodied,
healthy old blast of blasphemy when the soul is
vexed by any of the miseries incident to the pub-
lication of the evening newspaper. The whole
influence of this salutary change is felt by the old
staff, who have one and all gone off their liquor,
and thinned down perceptibly. Geo. Walstab
has lost much of his tine cavalier boot-and-saddle
swagger, and seems somehow to have been re-
formed into the solemn presentment of a Round-
head or Cropeared trooper. Ellis, the versatile man
of marvellous memory, has ceased to tell his green-
room stories. Jem Middleton has been detected
reading “Pilgrim’s Progress,” while O’Toole,poor
devil, is doing his best to appear as though born
and bred an Ulster Orangeman. Honest Sam
Winter, however, who cannot be all things to all
men, has growled his farewell curse, and left the
Herald to the care of the Elect. McKinley, of
the D.T.—and Punch ! —is to be the manager.
Anybody who remembers the good old, spicy,
stay-out-all-night style of the Herald, cannot
but be edified at the change which has come over
that disreputable old cripple. Sermons and soda-
water have succeeded the gay and giddy dissipa-
tion of the past career of the paper, and as fit and
proper to a visible decay of strength and mental
capacity, and a sure approach to dissolution, the
tone and style are now of the best improved
Christian order, warranted to wear, and well
shrunk. Poor old Herald ! Many have been
its vicissitudes under Kavanagh, Michie, Franklyn,
Levey and Winter; but never in its most de-
praved times did it fall into such humiliation as
now threatens it, at the hands of this Calvinistic
company of godly journalists. Eheu ! Eheu !
Dan O’Connor has just been appointed to
the N.S.W. Legislative Council. This is what he
said (as per Hansard) about the Legislative
Council aforesaid, not so very long ago :
I think it must be patent to every man in the com"
munity that, at no distant date, the Government must
take some action to maintain the honour and dignity of
Parliament by making the Upper House, not a place of
refuge for intellectual incapables, but a home of
patriotism and intellectual power. The members are
appointed at the bidding of ministers of the day. They
owe their existence, as members of the Council, to the
smiles or caprice of ministers, not to any services which
they have rendered, not to transcendent genius w’hich
they have displayed, but because, after a life of sordid
avarice, they desire to have the social distinction which
the position confers on them. Instead of being relegated
to obscurity, they are sent to a place where they have it
ip their power to defy the will of the people. In the
House of Lords are men who have in their veins the blood
of ancestors who have rendered marked services to the
state, men who are distinguished in every walk in life.
Take two or three men away from the Legislative Council
and, in the name of heaven, where can you match them
for a certain quality which 1 would be out of order in
mentioning?
J. H. Jones, Esq., Survey Camp, Toko
block, Taranaki, New Zealand, writes : —“Dear
Sir, —The bottle of Clements Tonic I received
from you gave me great satisfaction and ease.
I suffered from nervous debility and prickly
heat and one bottle of Clements Tonic did me a
power of good, and I intend to always keep it
by me, as it did so much good.” H. Garkell,
Esq., writes on May 20th: “St. Leonards,
Sydney,—Dear sir,—l can with pleasure bear
witness to the great relief I have received from
the use of Clements Tonic and Dr. Fletcher’s
Pills. I have been a great sufferer for 11 years
from liver disease, with at times considerable
enlargement, which caused a swelling in the
side under the ribs and was very painful, the
abdomen, bowels, &c., always felt very tender
on pressxire, with most obstinate constipation,
for which I took Fletcher’s Pills, the first dose
caused a copious evacuation and gave great
relief, and I thought I was all right, but after
a week I was as bad again as before, I again
had recourse to Fletcher’s Pills, but I took
Clements Tonic as well this time and continued
it for a couple of months, after the first dose I
felt better and got rid of all the symptoms I
used to have, as flushings of heat and cold,
splitting headaches, pains in the side and small
of the back, extreme lassitude, and the general
feeling of ‘ all right to-day, seedy to-morrow,’
all these symptoms with many others I used to
have, but now, thanks to Clements Tonic, I am
quite cured. I can get up in a morning re-
freshed by the night’s rest, and can eat a good
breakfast, whereas before taking the medicine
I scarcely ever could cat anything, and when I
did, it nearly always made me vomit, but now I
am quite well and have been so for 5 months.
I have no cause to fear a relapse. I don’t mind
your publishing my ease if you add nothing to
it, as it may bring relief to similar sufferers.”
Thomas Oliver, Esq., proprietor Lillydale
Express, Vic., writes under date Nov. 10th,
’9O :—Dear Sir, —About two months ago Mrs.
Oliver went to Sydney as weak and helpless as
a child, notwithstanding the doctors had tried
to baffle her complaint. Her friends in Sydney
(with whom she is at present) persuaded her to
take Clements Tonic, and from reports the
results are almost magical, instead of only
being able to walk 100 yards she can now walk
half a mile without the least trouble. She
hopes to return shortly, she says, ‘a new
creature’ thanks to Clements Tonic,” Such
grateful acknowledgments as these must carry
conviction to the most sceptical mind; the
great pity is that owing to the wonderful
efficacy of this remedy, unscrupulous traders
offer substitutes in place of Clements Tonic
when this article is demanded. Patients must
remember that a man who will sell an inferior
article for the sake of extra profit is a villain
and a rogue, for he not only robs you of your
money, but trifles with your health, for whilst
you fancy you are secure, the disease is making
headway all the time. Beware of these
swindlers and expose them to your neighbours,
and buy no Tonic that does not bear the
signature of F. Moore Clements in blue ink on
wrappers and labels, and the address, New-
town, N.S.W.

A certain learned professor was travelling
towards Sydney University in a crowded tram.
Suddenly a man left the corner opposite to
him, exposing the professor’s umbrella to the
vulture-like eye of a lady who sat at the other
end of the compartment. Arriving at her point
of exit, she said to the professor, “Will you kindly
hand me down my umbrella?” “Madam,” said
he, emphatically, “ this is my umbrella! ”
“Pshaw!” replied the dame, clearly “on the
make,” “ you claim the umbrella because you
think it belongs to the gentleman that just got
out.” “Pardon me, madam,” politely and neatly
said the professor, “ but that statement describes
your position, not mine. ” The passengers grinned
widely, and the lady got out awkwardly without
the parapluie.
* * *
A nude woman, the other day, walked
right down the main street of Richmond (Melb.),
ducking herself in the public-house horse-troughs
as she went along —decidedly an improper way to
water one’s whisky. The Sydney papers, in
printing a telegram about the matter, label it
“ A Maniac’s Freak.” Why necessarily a maniac ?
For all they know, the woman is as sane as James
Service, or Bruce Smith, or Sam. Griffith, and
does this kind of thing out of pure cussedness.
The papers would not admit that Johnston, who
did a still more insane act, was mad ; nor do they
admit that there is any chance of Colston being
insane. “ But the woman had no motive,”people
may say. Nonsense ! She may fancy that she
has no end of a figure. Maniac, indeed !
* # *
The recent report as to £lO,OOO having been
offered Sir Henry Parkes for a history of Aus-
tralia during the last 50 years, was, of course, mere
nonsense on the face of it. Who would think of
going for a history to a politician who fancied
himself the chief actor in the era described ? Then
again, the price would be colossal —even Brigand
Stanley, advertised in all languages, only got 50
per cent, more for his fine imaginative efforts.
The N.S.W. Premier’s autobiography, if skilfully
and carefully done, would be of enormous Aus-
tralian and general interest; and last year Sir
Henry offered to supply something of the kind to
a Sydney man for £lOOO and half-profits, but
apparently no strong local publisher could be
found to take it up on those terms.
# # *
Mr. Charles Jewel Oliver was born under
a lucky star. For having his services as a N.S.W.
Under-Secretary “dispensed with” at his own
request, he has been awarded a pension of £360 a
year, while he is drawing £l5OO a year as a super-
numerary Railway Commissioner. Is it not time
this farce were denounced in Parliament, and the
Superannuation Fund conserved for the relief of
old State servants? The Civil Service Board
must be composed of sorry civil servants, to allow
themselves to be “ used ” in this illegal fashiou.

Spicy ads. from a Sydney paper :
Wanted by widow lady, loan £l5, pay back instalments.
Wanted a kind gent, to befriend a respectable lady in
distress.
Would kind gentleman lend young widow in trouble few
pounds at once ?
Would elderly gentleman lend a widow in difficulties a
few pounds?
Would elderly gentleman of means oblige widow lady
with £5 privately ?
Will some kind gentleman lend a widow £5, paid back
weekly ?
Will gentleman assist a dressmaker in difficulties with a
few pounds?

Lord Jersey has been telling some official
fibs. Outside the boundaries of N.S.W. he signed
a batch of gubernatorial messages as at “ Govern-
ment House, Sydney.” The Constitution enacts
that a Governor shall only exercise the functions
of his office within the sphere of his jurisdiction ;
and as Lord Jersey did not appoint a deputy to
act in his absence, the point is whether the
messages are valid, and, if not, whether all the
Government measures are not improperly intro-
duced, including the Electoral Bill.
* * •
The second volume of the History of N.S.
Wales from the Records is a year or two overdue.
The Government may have unpleasant experiences
with the subscribers for the work if they don’t
mend their ways.
* * *
Lord and Lady Jersey have been con-
ducted through the underground workings of the
great Broken-hill Proprietary silver-mine. Will
someone now please conduct them through all the
underground workings of the wild-cat companes ?
They would be edified.
People are getting pretty sick of Sydney news-
paper (daily and weekly) mining advice. The
Bulletin presumes that the exhortations to “buy
so-and-so and so-and-so if yon have to pawn your
coat,” tendered every week by one classical pub-
lication to the world at large, benefit somebody.
They certainly don’t benefit that credulous por-
tion of the public which takes the tip; to con-
sistently follow, on a reasonably large scale, that
scribe’s advice would have broken even a
Jemmy Tyson. It makes one laugh to see shares
cracked up at 2s. lOd. and watch the faces of those
responsible for the crack-up as, two days later,
said shares are being unavailingly rushed round
in 5000 parcels at a modest “ bob.”

Charley Kingston, Q.C., of Adelaide,
boldly states that a knowledge of Latin is of
little or no use to a lawyer. He also holds that
doctors’ prescriptions should be written in Eng-
lish. What would the chemists do in the latter
event ? How could they have the gall to charge
3s. 6d. for threepen’orth of sal-volatile, syrup of
orange, and water, coloured with solution of burnt
sugar? Or Is. 6d. for a ha’porth of sulphate of
zinc, 10 drops of opium wine, and water as an eye-
lotion? But let the mixture read: —“ R. —Sp.
Ammon. Aromat. (and then something like three
or four wooden soldiers outside a sentry-box);
Syr. Aurant. (more hieroglyphics); Sacch. Ust.
(more again); Aq. @ (and the final lot);” with a
mystery instruction —“Ft. mist; cap. coch. mag.
T ter in die ;” or again, let the lotion read —“R. —
Zinci Sulph. (soldiers) ; Yin. Opii (soldiers) ; Aq.
@ (soldiei’s) ; Ft. lotic, u.t.d.” —why, the whole is
a cabalistic charm, and the art of charging top-
prices is established on a firm basis.
# * *
The N.S.W. Premier discovers that the
Australian Agents-General should be changed
every three or four years. Is he ready to sacrifice
his friend of half-a-century as another “sop” to
the new power? He further thinks that the A.-G.-
ship should be a non-political office filled by a
succession of colonists “ of independent means and
who would not take it for the sake of the salary”—
another way of saying that the representation of
Australia at the world’s hub should be the special
perquisite of a class instead of going to the ablest
man available out of all classes. By the way, if
Sir Saul Samuel was studiously discourteous to
Mr. Fitz Gerald, the N.S.W. Labour delegate, in
London, he must surely either have had official
instructions to be uncivil, or Fitz. must have run
up against him when he had the gout. Old Sir
Saul has, up to date, been found by travelling
Australians of all grades to be an exceedingly kind
and considerate man.

BROUGHT IT UPON HIMSELF.
UNKNOWN MASHER (iftiny his hat and proceeding to make himself agreeable) : “ Haw»
pardon me. You are fond of dumb animals, I see.”
SHE (frigidly) : “Yes; I much prefer them to the talkative variety.”
The N.S.W. Commissioner for Stamps is
a great revenue-hunter, and never lets a fair
chance slip. But he got a fright the other day
when the result of the Marianne Hope case was
cabled out. It is just possible that a few big
refunds will have to be made shortly.

Dear Bulletin, —The objection of the
N.S.W. Registrar-General (mentioned by you in
a recent issue) was not so much to his clerks
working in their shirt-sleeves, as to their appear-
ing in His Presence in that free-and-easy attire.
His Eminence is quite shirty enough for the whole
department.—Yours, Kiltentiuely.

A Privy Council appeal, in a case decided
by N.S.W. Full Court in ’B7, has been decided in
July of the year of our Lord 1891. The respon-
dent has meanwhile died, and the sum at stake
has all been swallowed up in costs. Truly, the
Australians are a long-suffering and law-abiding
people. # # #
The Anglican Synod, held in Sydney last
week, was opened with an attendance of 59 clergy -
men and 92 laymen, but the preliminary devotional
service in the Cathedral, intended to invoke the
Holy Spirit to preside over the Synod, was
attended by only 12 clergymen and two laymen.
The vulgar reading of this is that the Synod now
thinks that it can do very well without the
patronage of the Almighty.
* * *
It is long since we reprinted any hunks of
wisdom from the pen of that great master of
vigorous English, Ambrose Bierce. Read :
The writer who calls a social entertainment a “function”
is apparently in no peril of starvation: he has steady
employment on all the newspapers. There is comfort,
though, in the bright hope that he may hang, and that
great ravens may come from the four quarters of the sky
to fight for his eyes ; that the green and rancid fat may
drip from the toes of him, begetting the abundant maggot
beneath; that his fragrance may impest ten provinces
and unpeople the most ancient city in all the world !
These be cheery possibilities whereon the Christian soul
joys to dwell, remembering his great unworth. For God
hath said He will not hold him guiltless who mocks not
when evil comes upon the fool, nor prosper these who
mourn him. Wherefore, in forehanded fulfillment of the
Law let us gibe and gird and make our mouths marvel-
lous, even to-day, lest when the time of his punishment
be at hand we be worms’-meat ourselves.
* * *
Once more the Bierce :
There never was a prince nor a king who was a gentle-
man ; a princess nor a queen who was a lady. You may
search authentic history from alpha to omega and not
one instance can you find. Of those concerning whom
enough is known to justify an estimate of character all
have been vulgarians. In the nature of things it must
be so. The first requisite in the character of a gentleman
is his sense of equality with all other gentlemen : the
least assumption of superiority is fatal to the character.
The entire education of a prince, everything in his en-
vironment, both before and after he becomes a king if he
is that kind of royal pollywog, tends to keep him in
mind of his superiority to all about him. He comes to
believe in it, as a thing intrinsic and essential. He
permits himself to be addressed by titles signifying an
inherent and substantial difference between him and his
fellow mortals because he believes that such is the fact.
His irresponsibility for infractions of social and moral law,
the servility of all with whom he comes in contact, make
him with absolute certainty just what I have said—a
blackguard and a vulgarian. To a less degree the same is
true of “ the nobility and aristocracy.” It is nearly im-
possible that they should be gentlemen and ladies in that
high sense in which those use the words wlm use them
least. It is antecedently improbable and in point of fact
obviously untrue that “ the upper circles ” in any country
but a republic which is a republic in nature as well as in
name (as ours is not) are distinguished for moral worth.
They are “ a bad lot” the world over, and those of Eng-
land are probably not the worst despite our reverent
genuflexions at their “shrines.”
# * #
The absurd judgment given in favour of
Miss Wiedemann against Mr. Walpole for alleged
seduction, in an English court, was based on
corroborative evidence, consisting of letters
written by Miss Wiedemann herself to the
defendant and left unanswered by him. Which
rather reminds one of the cruel Sydney experiences
of Mr. Myles Mcßae.

An accomplished magazine critic thinks
that the novel of the future will begin where the

here mention that we are writing a novel begin-

It isn’t good form, in the very best British
circles, to cross a street diagonally. You may cut
off a considerable angle and save time, but the
proceeding lacks tone, and isn’t first-class. If a
person moving in the highest society wants to get
to the other side of the thoroughfare, she should
go right on till she gets opposite the place she is
aiming at—then stop suddenly as if she had
catalepsy or had seen a spectre —next describe a
quarter-circle, fetching out somebody’s eye with
her umbrella as she does it, and go right across in
a bee-line. When she gets to the middle of the
opposite pavement she makes another sharp turn,
and impales a fresh infant with her sunshade, and
goes on her way serenely. It is a sure sign of a
neglected education if she looks surprised when
she impales the infant. A person of the very high-
est culture will stop and talk in mangled French
to a passing acquaintance, with a child in a par-
tially disembowelled state entangled on the end of
her gingham, and never even change countenance.

The just-introduced N.S.W. Criminal Law
Amendment Bill places the dishonest civil servant
of the future on the same footing as the common
or garden rogue. In the case of the latter it is
and has been sufficient to_ prove a general em-
bezzlement ; in that of a civil servant each em-
bezzled item must be made the subject of a
separate indictment. Henceforth gentlemen in
the service who “stumble,” will have to plead to
a lump sum, “ Guilty or not guilty, av ye plaze.”

Condensed remark from an Ipswich (Q.)
paper:—
Queensland has been smitten in the face with the
Naval Defence Bill, and to-day she lies prostrate, her
power of self-government rent in twain, the chief part
torn from her, and the remnant lying in her helpless
hands bleeding to death.
Just so. Also in her dreams she sees the bright
lexicon of youth bounding through the primeval
forests, and the vanished grace of a day that is
gone has been butchered to make a Roman holi-
day, and Freedom has croaked owing to tumultu-
ous horror having got there with both feet.
* * *
As a rule, the woman whose dress is cut
lowest among all the crowd in the circle is the
immense, corpulent female of 47, whose arms look
like two red sacks of flour, while the great desert
of her shiny flesh expands so far that you feel
tired before you have walked twice round the bare
part of her. And the woman who runs her very
close in the matter of scarcity is the scrawny indi-
vidual of 17, whose bones jut out like crags and
pinnacles and old yellow knobs in a great waste
land of skin. When you find a plump and fresh-
looking maiden among the crowd it is three
chances to one that she is so disguised in bits of
lace, muslin, and other small mysteries that she is
about as invisible as if she had no evening dress
at all. Heaven knows why this is—we don’t.
The bare and mountainous old female, or her
famine-stricken sister, might be able to explain it,
but we have never had the pluck to ask either of
them.

One of the most “ swagger ” house-boats
at Henley this year is hired by Mount Morgan
Knox D’Arcy. The decorations cost a small
fortune, and fairly give Colonel North the knocks.
The gilded D’Arcy is a most hospitable fellow,
and keeps open table on board. Needless to say
that Bananalanders turn up religiously in scores
when the gong sounds.

There is much Melbourne discussion over
Miss Pickett’s death at Colombo. Persuaded by
Madame Blavatsky’s particular friend, Col.
Olcott, she went there, from Melbourne, to take
charge of the Buddhist Girls’ School, but it
appears that, being short-sighted, she fell in a
well, and was drowned. On the other hand,
suicide is alleged.

The leading Melbourne caterer was
engaged, not long ago, to provide for the Young
Women’s Christian Association, at the Town
Hall, but they found out he was an alcohol-
merchant, and deputationised to argue and pray
him out of it. He assured them that he only
attended to their little affair as a matter
of benevolence, and nothing ever paid him
where alcohol was not involved. This was indeed
a neat stroke. Pious people who like not beer
have enormous appetites.

“SHE FOLLOWED HIM HOME.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“About three weeks ago we chronicled the
death of Mr. . It is now our sad duty to
announce the demise of his widow who has abso-
lutely died of grief at her loss. ’’—[Daily Paper.)
Her soul through magnificent space
Has passed up beyond the deep blue
Of the sky, and the light on her face
Is lovely, and radiant and new ;
With never a sign or a trace
Of the sorrow and pain that she knew.
From the folds of a fierce sudden woe
She has fled where the days are all bleat—
Where a balm for her grief she will know
In the arms of (he one she loved best.
And the parting thatr'saddencd her so

A London paper states that the Prince of

Since the Hotel Metropole, Sydney, was
licensed to sell liquors, it pays a dividend of 8 per
cent. As a coffee-palace, it was a spec, out of
which its owners could only expect to draw divi-
dends in Heaven. By the way, teetotaldom
will be painfully interested to learn that at the
big Australia Hotel, Sydney, more than 150
gallons of over-proof whisky are being consumed
weekly.

Mrs. Newmann, of Logan Reserve (Q.),

one girl. Total to date : 18, of whom 15 are

The M‘Meckan (Melb.) will-case cost over
£7500. The barristers absorbed £2280, the solici-
tors (who paid witnesses, &c.) took double as
much. The jury got £2B 12s. each, or £343 4s. in
all. The trial lasted 17 days. Purves, Q.C.,
drew 625 guineas ; Wood and Madden, 490
guineas; Topp and Gold ham, 355 guineas.

Mem. for lady witnesses. Purves, Q.C.,
said that Miss Mackie need not have been un-
truthful about her age, as she was not bound to
have answered the question. Higinbotham, C. J.,
did not object to this statement, so it may pass as
good law. But how would this work in a
marriage-promise case in which the bride had
understated her age ?

Some time ago the S.M. Herald, as self-
constituted spokeswoman for the epicures of
Sydney, bitterly complained that at local banquets
oysters were served on the flat instead of on the
deep shell; and now we have the cultured Even-
ing News (shade of old Sam Bennett!) moaning
loudly because at the inaugural banquet of a
Sydney hotel “ Canard sauvage was not served.”
The chef explains that he did serve wild duck,
only the Evening News didn’t recognise it.

“A well-educated sense of humour will
save a woman when religion, training and home
influences fail,” says Rudyard Kipling. Quite
right, but—as the cookery-books don’t say : “First
catch your humorous woman.” If women had
any humour a lot of things would happen. For
instance, the clergy would have to chop wood for
a living.

The gallant Queensland cavalry “ volun-
teers” are now doing some underground engineer-
ing with a view to getting paid ; and the local
military officers have had a board appointed to
examine their claims to extra remuneration on
account of special strike services. So these
warriors are not disposed to live on votes of
thanks. They recall in a roundabout way the
more honest Soudan contingenteer who when
asked, “What are you going to fight for?” replied,
“ Five bob a day and tucker.”

Concerning the influence of climate on
manners. In the rural Maoriland districts up
north the inscription generally reads : “ You are
requested to close this gate,” In the middle pro-
vinces, where man is a shade less civilised, it
appears in a shorter form: “Please close this
gate. ” Down among the savages of Otago and
Southland, the brief paragraph on the top bar is
simply: “Shut this gate.” You can’t get any
further south than that.

The Melbourne lady who lately claimed a
corpse for that of her poor lost husband, just pre-

The Melbourne lawyers, having taken a
first pull of £BOOO at the M'Meckan estate, are
now engaged in whispering around that a new
trial would upset the previous verdict and leave
things as they were, after which the other side
could start again and give the defendants a fresh
opportunity to appeal and reverse the former
decision. There’s nothing like M‘Meckan hay
while the sun shines.

The Age poop-poohed the possibility of

Licensing-Inspector Attewell successfully
opposed the granting of a publican’s license last
week in Sydney, on the ground that the applicant
was a woman, and that the house she sought to
license could not be managed by a woman. Thus
is the question of the equality of the sexes settled,
once for all, in a bold, policeman-like manner.

North Shore (Sydney) has a private gas
Co., or rather a private gas Co. “has” North
Shore (Sydney). The Company wants £90,000 for
its property. The Council can do it for under
£60,000 and mean to do it. Hereupon the
Company whines and says that widows and
orphans have shares in the Company which will
be ruined by Council competition. The Council
rejoins that widows and orphans are being ruined
by gas-bills. The Council is going ahead, anyhow.
Dear Bulletin, —In yesterday’s Argus there is
a sub-leader re loss of ships, which remarks that when
there were few or no lighthouses or tugs, wrecks were
uncommon, but that now they are many. The
master, says the Argus, “ must have degenerated.” Of
course there are more wrecks now, for in days gone by
the shipmaster—who must degenerate under existing
conditions—was fairly paid and treated, and was allowed
to manage the ship both as regards sailing and loading
and manning ; but how different now! Take the master
of an ordinary large sailing-ship. His wages are often
£l2 per calendar month, or Bs. per day (little better than
labourer’s wages), and he is put in charge of a ship per-
haps over £20,000 in value, with perhaps £50,000 worth of
cargo on board and the lives thrown in. To obtain this
high position he has to pass three examinations and the
best part of a life at sea. He has little or no voice in the
loading or manning of his ship, and is liable to be dis-
missed at any port at any part of the world at any inomen'.
The next person in command is the chief office r
whose wages range about four shillings per day ; then
comes the second-officer, at often 2s. Bd. per day. Take
a large mail-steamer worth perhaps half a million pounds,
carrying hundreds of lives and thousands of pounds of
cargo, where, should anything happen to her master, the
chief-officer takes charge. This gentleman, you will find,
this gentleman often starts at 6s. Bd. per day, always has
to dress well, wear expensive livery, mix with people of
means, and yet it takes him 10 to 15 years to obtain this
position. I have not said anything of the hardships, loss
of home comforts and recreation, incidental to the life of
a seaman, nor to the fearful risks so often undertaken to
make fast passages, the alternative to which is the
“sack.” I am now referring to shipping companies
generally. To sum up, the shipmaster has degenerated
through bad pay, overwork, and bad treatment, and the
losses are swelled by overloading and undermanning. As
I dare not here write ray name, I will simply subscribe
myself— Constant Reader, Melbourne, July 19, ’9l.

The Governor of New Caledonia has made
it illegal for barmaids to serve drinks in his
dominions.
Guinness’, Limited, have paid 15 per cent,
carried forward £68,000 and added £lOO,OOO to
reserve. Long may they wave ! Without them,
oysters would be a mockery.
Both as an anodyne and expectorant, Ayer’s
Cherry Pectoral is prompt in its action. It checks
the advance of disease, allays all tendency to
inflammation and consumption, and speedily
restores health.
We are told that when the “scab”
shearers from Sydney reached a black-block
(N.S.W.) station the other day, eight of them took
all day to shear 96 sheep.
In answer to a remark in the organ of a
Bourke M.P., The Bulletin has to say that it
has seen through, and has not sympathised with,
the sinister efforts made to work up a row be-
tween the police and the unionist shearers. The
political crowd who have been egging the shearers
on to violence, despite the prospect of an amicable,
even if but temporary, arrangement, are a set
whose word no one will take, and whose most
sacred promise is not worth a copper token. They
would sneak into wombat holes in the event of a
fight, and, if there were no longer any prospect of
making capital out of the trouble; would not
put their hands into their pockets to save insur-
gent bushworkers from being hanged as high as
Hainan. The road to reform lies, not through
physical violence, while entrenched monopoly has
a clear and overwhelming advantage, but through
the Legislature ; and any politician who, with his
tongue in his cheek, “kids on” the unarmed!
shearer to threaten violence against the law, with
its gun in its hand, is the bitterest enemy of those
he gammons to serve. The fighting plan has been
tried and has failed. The Parliamentary plan is
now being tried and threatens to succeed —much
to the chagrin of certain mangy politicians whose
game it is to prove that the workman, voting-
ticket in hand, cannot be his own political
saviour.
The Australian Workman upholds the
principle of “ One-Man-One-Billet,” and contro-
verts the Bartonian assertion that —
If members have to confine themselves solely to politics
the country will lose the services of many men of in-
tellect and experience, who cannot give (.sic) those services
it doing so deprived them of attendance on their business.
“ The sooner we lose the service of those business
men the better,” says The Workman —
The legislation of this country, the making of good
laws and the repealing of bad ones, the solution of the
problems which are agitating the minds of all white
people, demand that a politician shall give up the whole
of his time to serving the interests of his country. If a
man is not prepared to do this then he has no right to be
a member of Parliament; and be his intellect what it
may, we have plenty of intellectual and experienced men
who are prepared to give the whole of their time and brain
power to the interests of their country. “One-man-one-
billet” is our motto.
This sounds like the utterance of a man who, in
the first flush of getting £3OO a year for his Par-
liamentary services—twice as much, perhaps, as
he ever earned before in his life —or smarting
under defeat at the hands of men who could hope-
fully’ aspire to more than £3OO a year, seeks to
make all people conform to his own standard.
Yon could not get the very best, or even the most
mediocre, men in the community to confine them-
selves absolutely to politics for the present rate of
Australian parliamentary pay, and as most seats
are uncertain at the best of times, the man who
relied solely on them as a means of livelihood
would show himself to be an improvident fool.
Had “ One-man-one-billet ” been the rule, scores
of the best men who have sat in Parliament would
have been excluded, and were it the rule now
the Houses would be largely' composed of mere
shiftless, needy seekers after parliamentary screw,
and puffy people “of independent means.” In
N.S. Wales, for instance, G. H. Reid and Barton
would be out of Parliament for a start ; so would
Bruce Smith and M‘Millan— The Bulletin, while
working for the ascendancy of Labour, hopes to
see the best men from all sides in the Legisla-
ture — and sj would not only every other man
who could not live on £3OO a year, but everyone
who, in the open market, could earn more. If
a member does get £3OO a year he is expected to
give away half of it, just as the Minister is
expected to give away £6OO or £7OO of his £l5OO.
The object of granting pay to members of Parlia-
ment is not necessarily to shut rich men out —
that is, men who are rich because they are
highly paid for duties other than political, but
to let poor men in. It is in the direction of
equalising opportunities. A rich man may be a
good democrat. Sir George Grey, for example,
is a rich man. The man who can best afford to
fulfill the one-man-one-billet condition is the pro-
perty-owner, of necessity utterly out of sympathy
with labour legislation.
FROM GAY TO GRAY.
The sun it shineth brightly
On a petted royal youth
When his step is gay and sprightly,
And he hasn’t lost a tooth;
Life once was all to-morrow
For the giddy coming K.—
Now, he wears a look of sorrow.
And his hair’s gone gray.
'Twas nice to be a Bertie
In hig podgy golden prime }
Till long past five-and-thirty
He enjoyed a jolly time;
But* the passion flower withers
As the summer fades away—
O, alas ! for royal brithers
When their hair turns gray.
Lovely woman’s sweetest glances
Greet his Highness as of yore,
But the taste for “ passing fancies ’*
He has lost for evermore ;
The life that was so pleasant
Seems a thing of yesterday,
’Twere as well to be a peasant
Now his hair’s gone gray.
Such a spectacle pathetic
Is not very often seen ;
The effect is quite magnetic
On the Sydney Bullytebn ;
Though, perhaps, we have been ready
Rather cruel things to say,
We’ll be kind to Albert Eddy
Now his hair’s gone gray.

Radam’s Microbe Killer Co.
Gentlemen, —Some time since you kindly gave
to an applicant of the Melbourne Jewish Philan-
thropic Society two jars of your “ Microbe
Killer.” The unfortunate man was in a bad state
from consumption, and very little hopes were
entertained for his ultimate recovery. After
taking five jars of your “Microbe Killer ” he found
great relief, and, continuing with same, is now all
but thoroughly recovered and able to earn a living
for his wife and family. You are at perfect liberty
to make what use you think fit of this testimonial,
and I can vouch for its correctness in every
particular.—Yours, &c.,

J. A. B.” (Hawthorn) : Too “long-winded.”....
‘John Stewart”: Many thanks. ..“K.R.” (Bendigo):
Next week “ Forsitan ” : Will consider for next week.
. ..“Christian K.”: Old as Jerusalem... “W.A.K.”:
Yes, you are a Civil servant and are subject to the pro-
visions of the Civil Service .Act which provides for your
pay being docked on account of the superannuation fund.
“W.J.C.”: Rather rough. We don’t go out of our
way to deal with religious questions....“ Artaxerxes” :
Nothing under Heaven is new- not even your foolish
letter. Tub Bulletin is not absolutely original it is
only as original as it can be. To show all you know about
the matter it is only necessary to state that the alleged
joke in question was not stolen from the Family Herald
—which steals nearly all its paragraphs—but probably
from the source whence the F.H. stole it..,. “Blue
Gum”: Will come to them shortly. Both type-written...
“Rationalist”: The kingly superstition is largely a con-
sequence of the theological one, as you say.... “ Golden
Fleece” : All said before.... “Minnamurra ” : Your verses
lack oongruity... “B.B.”: Too gushy and too hack-
neyed “Republican Australian”: We admire your
sentiments, but pooh-pooh your spelling, anathematise
your handwriting, scoff at your rhymes, and execrate
your rhythm....“ Alexandra”: No room for purely
parochial politics “ Kumanave Adrink”: The letter
of “Paterfamilias” has aroused considerable controversy
—it has been taken too seriously. Its purport was appa-
rently to show one of the tendencies towards inequality
in prevailing conditions, which can only be removed by
their alteration....“ Navigator”: Not in our way ...
“ A.M.L. ” : The Bulletin no more believes in Parkesnow
than it ever did. It regards his political existence as
utterly noxious and absolutely degrading to the public
life of Australia. Trying to use as a tool an insincere old
schemer, who has so far used all other men as tools, is, we
admit, an experiment, but nevertheless one worth trying,
(2) as “Mister Gladstone” is just now advocating One-
Man-One-Vote Parkes may push it through on the “me
ar.d Mister Gladstone” principle... “ Yarrawonga ” :
The principle of betterment is undoubtedly a righteous
one. Corollary: If a specific agreement respecting
reservation for railway construction appears in the title,
which moans that the land was only allowed to be taken
over subject to a defined agreement, the whole ground of
complaint is covered. Let the matter be fought out in
the law courts and see where you will be. It may be
hard on the purchaser from the original holder ; but he
only purchases “within” the title, and is supposed to
have horse-sense enough to know it and examine the said
title.... “W. Fitz ” ; Thanks, but next time try and boil
it down “If we have your story you haven’t written
your name on the face thereof. Name it, please? ...
“ Carbine ” (Adelaide): Geo. A. is certainly right. If you
like you can have a (properly-accredited) representative
to see it worked off “Win. H. K.”; At variance with
Bulletin ideas... “J. Court”: W.P.8.,. “T.G.S.”; Thanks ..
“B.B.”: To have any interest or influence women
writing on Socialism should drop generalities and get to
particulars....“ W.M.” : Wants condensation and finish
“Hans Machputy”: Too lengthyA. M'L.”:
Your verses are not likely to “get us in for libel; ” we’ve
burnt ’em too much.. .“Mindai”: Having lived in
b arding houses, we are not disposed to resurrect buried
me nodes in the dry-hash of your verse....“ R.J.1.”
iStockton); You could not expect us to publish 200
lugubrious lines such as you send along. Cultivate the
faculty; verse - writing is an inexpensive and refin-
ing amusement “Sans Peur ” : Will consider
“Hayseed”: Not suitable “Nat. Derns ” ; Hough’s
lines on the Devil were replied to metrically in The Bul-
letin five years ago “ Ironsides ’’: The stomach of the
is probably beginning to turn against
gratuitous advice . “A.V.0.”: Stale n0w.... “Didy-
mus”: (1) He must gr straight. (2) On the instalment

be consented to. (4) The Labour-party are pledged to a

COLGATE’S
SOAPS and PERFUMES
SPORTING NOTIONS.
The six-foot-two figure of the Earl of West-
moreland has disappeared from the English turf and
sought seclusion in the family vault. His ludship went
"broke” at an early period of his racing career, but the
“books ” he owed money to must have died long since,
leaving hint to settle down amidst an odour of sanctity as
a more or less perpetual steward of the Jockey Club. The
“home ” sporting papers will, no doubt, relate many in-
teresting reminiscences of this colossal identity, who
would have made a splendid earl “on the stoush ” a
couple of centuries back. As things went this man of
long descent was simply so much bone and sinew wasted. "
# # *
The cable informs us that a New York stock-
broker named backer, has failed for £300,000 —
That there’s much, after all, in a game
Is proved by this Mellikan joker
If he only plays high at the game
A Backer must soon be a “broker.”
* * *
Kingston, of the S. A. Assembly, suggests that it
would be much better if Governor Kintore attended to his
own business. The noble Sandy hasn’t any business at
present except mining shares and land specs. ; he attends
to them dutifully enough, goodness knows! At the
Flcmington Spring Meeting he will pay great attent ion to
Donald Wallace and Septimus Miller, you bet! Kintore
is a perfect terror for his own business.
# # *
American sports say that Kilrain is a bettor
boxer than Slavin, but that the latter is the greatest
fighter, bar Sullivan, living. Why bar Sullivan ?
* * *
A certain well-known Melbourne “hooky”
warns the lamb-like public, in a sporting paper that the
national game of football is on the down-grade. “ It’s a
matter of money, now,” says he, and he ought to know.
# # #
Griffo has, no doubt, discovered, through his
f,,-ht with Murphy, that as he gets into years he requires
anore training, and that a boy ,of 17 or 18, with ordinary
exercise, can undergo as much fast work as a well-trained
man of mature years.
# # *
Judging from the' attendance, it woidd seem
that the days of the Waterloo Coursing meeting are num-
bered. Take away owners, trainers and bookmakers and
you could gather up the rest in a bucket.
* # *
One of Sullivan’s American backers has put up
1000 dollars with the N.Y. Herald for a match with
Slavin. Bluff.
# # *
In Sullivan’s “ knock-out ” days he used to be
allowed to stand over his prostrate foes and jab them
before they were fairly on their feet—while they wer e
“ technically so much up as to be technically not down.”
* * *
Felix Tanner, the fasting gentleman,, has started
business in Adelaide. This time he is fasting in an
abandoned’ boot-shop, which arrangement has an unpro-
misi v r look about it, somehow. Probably the fasting
industry is about played out. The Bulletin suggests, in
order to revive this decaying industry, that there should
be two fasting men, and that they should fast 40 weeks,
and then fight each other to a finish for £lOOO and a
funeral. If this wouldn’t infuse some vigour into the
proceedings, nothing would.
# * *
One Cussen, aged 19 years, 6ft. 4in. in height,
the other day at Loneragan’s, Mudgee (N.S.W.), carried
(so says a local paper) a 2001 b.-bag of flour under each arm
for 20 yards. Now, many years ago there was in the Vic-
torian police a trooper named Forbes, who weighed under
list., and yet could ascend a 14-step set of stairs with
2001 b. of flour under each arm.
# # *
London Referee maintains that the Kilrain
w ho fought Slavin is the wreck of the man who really
knocked out Smith. “If an evil spirit,” says the Ref.,
■“might wreak his wicked will in sending a big, powerful,
plucky, well-built, loose-limbed, very decent man indeed
to physical ruin, such a demon could not run an athlete
faster on the downward road to perdition than Kilrain
raced himself after he achieved in England celebrity.”
Nevertheless, the American sporting reporters—not that
they are infallible authorities-desoribed Jake’s condition
as perfect when the Australian gave him worst. Con-
dition counts for nothing without constitution.
# * *
The Leader correspondent says that should
Jackson and Slavin meet, Slavin will smother the- black,
who has played himself out by fast living.
# * *
Cable reports of alleged big winnings at Monte
Carlo are coming too frequently of late. They look very
much like gambling-heil advertisements designed to trap
the travelling Australian. It would pay the hell-owners
to subsidise the cableman handsomely in this respect.
# * *
The genial Mick Dooley’s real name is not
“Michael,” but “Nicholas;” still they persist in calling
him “ Mick.”
# # #
If some of the Melbourne turf-advisers don’t tip
any better than they pay their debts, we pity their
credulous clients.
The many complaints about misfitting
artificial teeth, we are told, is due, a great deal, to
the work being put out. The success of Mr. J. T.
Marshall, dentist, of Sydney Arcade, is doubtless
owing to the fact of all dentures being made on
the premises, and not passed until perfect, thus
ensuring first-class workmanship at moderate fees.
When, by reason of a cold or from any other
cause, the secretory organs become disordered,
they may be stimulated to healthy action by the
use of Ayer s Cathartic Pills. Sold by all dealers

A counter-jumper—Sir William Gordou-
Cumming. .
Justice Manning (N.S.W.) thinks it should
be made penal for a man trading alone to attach
“ and Co.” to his name.
Says an epigrammatist: —“In England
you must not gamble; or if you do, you must
cheat, 'i hen you will have public sympathy.”
Three thousand V.D.L. Bank shares were
sold by auction, at Hobart, on Friday, July 21;
the bank suspended on Monday, August 3. Who
was “ in the know Of su.h is the Kingdom of
Heaven.
The marmalade ladled out to Premier
Park es by the Pall Mall Gazette is attributed
by the London correspondent of the S. A.
Advertiser to the fact that the Pall Mall is
edited by a brother-in-law and regular corres-
pondent of B. R. Wise.
The other day Judge Docker (N.S.W.)
sentenced two men found guilty of violently
assaulting a fellow prisoner in gaol—one to ten
years’ additional penal servitude and the other to
seven years additional, each to have three hog-
gings of 25 lashes. A day or two afterwards, on
a pretext too flimsy to be discussed under the
circumstances, the Judge called up the prisoners
again and remitted the floggings. We hope that
the Judge was ashamed of himself—or of the Law.
We presume that any civilized being would be
ashamed of a law so barbarous and illogical as to
add flaying alive to ten years “extra” penal
servitude.
Mr. and Mrs. Eather, of Windsor (N.S.W.),
have just got out of gaol. Twelve months ago
someone brought a slander-action against Mrs.
Eather, in which her husband was “joined.” A
verdict was given for the plaintiff, and the unfor-
tunate pair, being moneyless, had, under the
iniquitous N.S.W. Defamation Act, to go to gaol,
where they have since languished apart from their
young children, who have been the recipients
of charity. Imprisonment for debt has therefore
not been abolished in N.S.W. And allowing, for
the sake of argument, that Mrs. Eather deserved
12 months’ gaol for her slander, is it not altogether
against the general tendency of the marriage laws
that her husband should be made thus responsible
for her act ? How would this kind of thing be
regarded in any semi-civilised country—say in
England ?
Capitalist and labourer, aristocrat and
proletaire have' recognised the efficacy of the
Bethel Electric Medical Baths, Swanstou-street,
Melbourne, in all digestive, nervous and con-
sulatory diseases.*
Secured Deposits. —ln view of the promised
legislation to regulate the business of those finan-
cial institutions which receive money on deposit
from the public, we are pleased to notice that a
step in the right direction has been taken by the
Universal Land and Deposit Bank, Limited, who,
in a little pamphlet entitled “Mutual Banking,”
have called attention to a few points of practical
interest to all bank depositors. The main idea of
the above company appears to be that the
depositors, not the shareholders, should be the
first to receive the benefit of the profits made by
the bank, whilst, by the issue of debentures, they
(the depositors) obtain lien over all the
assets of the concern ana are in possession of a
collateral security equal to the sum deposited,
which, by the way, bears interest. The scheme
is entirely novel, and we think the originators
deserve the support of the public in their efforts
to improve the position of the depositor. We
commend the above-mentioned pamphlet to the
attention of our readers who contemplate invest-
ing their money in this manner. It is forwarded
post free to any address by the bank, whose office
is at 301 Pitt-street, Sydney.*
"KEEP NO FOR REFERENCE.
The following suggestions aie not designed to
induce the public to attempt the duties of the
regular surgeon, but merely to place the reader in
possession of a means of treatment of the minor
accidents occurring daily in the household. No
family can be assured against accidents; the
broken bone, the dislocated joint, the severed
artery, these are misfortunes that may possibly
happen to anyone ; and we scarcely need to add
that they demand the instant attention of the
most skilful surgeon within reach. But by house-
hold accidents we mean those which are constantly
occurring every day, in nearly every family, and
which, while not always dangerous in themselves,
are exceedingly annoying. Burns, bruises, cuts,
scalds, sprains, &c., are principal among these
troublesome and annoying occurrences, and
demand immediate treatment with the best means
at band. In the kitchen, the dining-hall, the
nursery, and the sitting-room they are liable to
happen, and instead of fear and alarm at the sight
of the cut or smashed finger, or burned or bruised
arm, or scalded surface, a cool and quiet manner
should be assumed, and after washing away the
blood (if required), the injured parts should be
dressed with that most valuable remedy—St.
Jacobs Oil. Its especial worth for the injuries
named, and others of similar nature, is not based
upon mere claim and assertion ; but its constant
use for a long term of years has given it a
reputation which is always increasing. Its sur-
prisingly quick relief, its cleansing properties, it s
tendency to quickly remove all inflammation, and
its wonderful efficacy in the above, as well as in
all muscular and other pains, such as rheumalis n,
neuralgia, toothache, headache, stiffness of the
limbs, joints, &c., these qualities render St. Jacobs
oil pre-eminently the best external remedy before
the people, which claim is fully substantiated by
the class of strong testimony voluntarily accorded
it by representatives of every class and station in
life.
ASSAULTS ON WOMEN.
At present it is only a suspicion that the police
have, but something may be expected to come
out of it. Something usually does, even if it is
only a proof that they were entirely in the wrong,
and there was no ground tor suspicion anyhow.
But they may be in luck this time, and everybody
hopes they are, because these assaults on females
in lonely places are becoming scandalously
frequent, and it is more than likely that they
never will be quite stopped until the male relatives
of the victims turn out for the purpose, and then
somebody will get shot, or badly bruised, and the
police will get there in time to recognise the
remains of the man they suspected all along, and
followed for miles, and saw him do all torts of
things except the one particular thing they wanted
him to do, and which thing he would not do,
because he knew them, and stopped to have a
smoke and a yarn with them, and found out as
much about their business as they, knew them-
selves ; and then, like a mean skunk, went off in
another direction and did it again somewhere
else. And if he should some night be shot in the
act so much the better for all the survivors,
because if bo is only taken alive some humanitarian
crank, who has no female relatives of bis own,
will certainly arise and say; “Do not scar his
tender shoulders with the la°h, but lock him up
comfortably, and treat him kindly, and lend him
a tract to read.” For so the world wags, and the
thoughtful ruffian takes note of it. Also when a
worthy wife and mother, who is the mainstay of a
household and the support of a drunken loafer,
gets assaulted by a lamp which bursts like a 10-
inch shell, and wafts everybody but the drunken
loafer aforesaid who bought the kerosene into
glory, the same world sagely remarks: “ Who’d
have thought it? However are people to know
when they are safe?” Which is a ridiculously
insipid conundrum in view of the fact that the
virtues of Luxene, the new illuminant, have been
so freely published and tested that they are now
known to all men—except perhaps the police, who
are so constantly on the track of suburban band ts
and “ fan-tan ” Chinamen that they have no time
to read the papers. But everybody can find out
all they want to know about Luxene by applying
to Messrs. J. Barlow and Co., T. W. Eady and
Son, Mason Bros., Ltd., Tillock and Co., D.
Mitchell and Co., J. Keep and Sons, Holdswortb,
MTherson and Co., M'Lean Bros, and Rigg,

point. The dock-labourers for instance, threw up
their income of eight shillings a week and went
rollicking out on “ strike” long before they had a
reserve fund of five millions at the bank. It was
like their atrocious impudence, not to postpone
the matter for another century, or so.

S ; r Lepel Griffin declares that opium-con-

This quite fits in with the view expressed to The
Bulletin by a surgeon who had practised'3o years
in Hong-kong, and probably knew as much about
the matter as any man on earth. The fact is that
every people has its sedative stimulant. Wine in
one country, tobacco in another, opium in another.
The only people who can do without stimulant
are those who have no nerves—usually because they
have no brains. Abolish rum and you erect a drug-

“ Leslie’s ‘ 'Av a glass along with me ’ is one of the
best character songs ever heard in Melbourne.” So says
a Gaiety “supporter,” Yes, and his joke about the
“ hairy parent” and the “heir apparent” and the “’ail-
apparent” is one of the most brilliantly original chestnuts
of humour ever heard in Australia.
Perhaps, remarks a correspondent, the Gaiety Com-
pany are too high-class to get Lance Lenton or someone
to re-write their “ comic ” songs locally, but it would be
such an improvement, even with the Cockney or coster
accent left in.
A noticeable feature in “Ruy Bias,” Melbourne

The queerest thing in the world was how Fritz Emmet
made his Melbourne hit, with Minnie Palmer’s J. A.

one night the Governor went, when Emmet chose to get

Blanche Stammers running off the stage in a fit of
laughter. After this the larrikins took the show under
their patronage, and it had a tremendous run, with
Emmet’s songs humming unceasingly in the Melbourne
air. Emmet was this kind of man—you would drop in to
see his old familar first act, only intending to stop a few
minutes, but you would be unable to tear yourself away
from his rubbish. R.I.P.

Lady Clancarty, late Dunlo, late Belle Bilton, is said to

J. L. Toole has struck oil (as much as his little theatre

plays, called “ Ibsen’s Ghosts.” As a counterblast to this

Scandinavian Symphony, on the ground that it is so
strangely remindful of the great “Master.” Unfor-
tunately Cowen wrote his Symphony before he knew
there was a “ Master” at all.

Georgina Lingard, a Yankee actress, made an appoint-

whip at the trysting-place. The lady followed up this
icurvy trick by charging the poor fool with insulting
oehaviour, or something of that sort, and having him
oound over to keep the peace. Georgina is possibly a
highly-virtuous genius, whose black-rimmed eye flashes
fury at the thought of any man writing a letter to an
actress before he has been introduced to her mother. On
the other hand, Georgina may have discovered that her
admirer was worth very little as a mash, but a tremen-
dous lot as an advertisement.

ship had not been out three hours before she had explored
it thoroughly from stem to stern and down into the
hold. One dark night she announced her intention of
mounting to the crow’s nest. It takes a man of good
nerve to do this even in quiet weather, and on this
evening there was a heavy sea running. The captain and
officers urged her not to attempt it, but she laughed at
them and ran up to the foot of the topmast with the
lightness and agility of a cat. The members of her
company, the other passengers, the ship's officers, and
many of the crew had gathered on deck and were watch-
ing her breathlessly as she turned to descend. When
half-way down she stopped, and, clinging to the rigging
with one hand and gesticulating with the other, began
reciting a poem from Victor Hugo. The wind blew her
skirts with tremendous force against the rigging, and the
ship was tossing in a heavy sea, but she held on and went
through the poem.” How truly theatrical!

“Give Wing's to My Soul.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I.
How many old diggers of the early days on North
Gympie recall Mark Foster? He was a great,
long, slouching dyspeptic-looking mixture of the
Victorian and Yankee, who pottered about from
mine to mine, nearly always on his own account,
and always within a couple of days’ rations of the
end of his resources. He looked the embodiment
of melancholy. Those who remember him will,
however, be able to recall many of his sentiments
which were sunny rather than sombre, and a few
of the peculiarities which enlisted the goodwill of
every party of men among whom he fell.
His favourite expression, “ Give wings to my
soul,” was applied to him as a nickname in several
tents, and it is possible that this name outlives the
real one in the memories of many.
He had a peculiar way of drawling those words.
Ordinary diggers’ speech is a forcible article. It
comes from the muzzle as if there were a full
charge of powder at the back and cuts clean to
the ear of the listener. Mark’s method of delivery
was just the contrary. The words themselves
were of the hymnal character and their vocal
vesture matched. “Give wings to my soul.”
Whether it was a snake-yarn of stupendous pro-
perties, a nobbier of extra-fiery draught brandy,
or a lucky discovery among the pebbles in the
creek, Mark’s emotions found an equally satis-
fying vent in “Give wings to my soul.” Where
he picked the expression up was never known. He
was not a reader, nor did he use the words in any
devotional sense. In fact, he was no more
religious than are diggers generally. This was
well-known, otherwise his exclamation would not
have been tolerated, nor would he have been such
an all-round favourite.
It sounds paradoxical, but it is a fact that
melancholy-looking men make the best of boon
companions. Men who seem to have a natural
aversion for society are the pleasantest associates
once they are well in it. So, when Mark dipped his
head and inserted his long body inside the door
of the Mia-Mia Hotel the ruddy-faced diggers
there assembled used to call on him, in one
breath, to push up to the counter. When Mark
complied, as he almost invariably did, the fun
really began, and every time he exclaimed “ Give
wings to my soul,” the spirits of the crowd leaped
several feet higher, and that in the bottles sank
proportionately lower.
But North Gympie began to thin out. Com-
panies with money were laying hold of the likely
spots, and the enterprising free lances had to push
afield. Instinctively they climbed the ridges, but,
when up, some went eastward and some west-
ward, and soon the gay guests of the once
rollicking Mia-Mia Hotel were straying in ones
and twos all over the tableland.
In a western gully Mark pitched his tent. His
liking for a lone hand was undisputed. A mush-
room hotel had sprung up a couple of miles off,
and thither he went at irregular intervals to
exchange a little dust for needful commodities.
Thescene of his work was desolate in the extreme.
A little rivulet dropped languidly from stone tc
stone, curling into pools here and there, but with
a weary gurgle as if it ran to a funeral march
There were trees about, but the bark was hanging
off most of them, like old posters off dead walls
Everybody has heard of the red clay of that
region, but where on Mark’s section the stones
gave place to clay, it was redder than usual. Mark
knocked off three or four pennyweights a day at
the start, but soon even this small assurance of
wealth dwindled down. At last his dish merely
yielded a colour.
It happened at this stage that a flood set in.
The rain poured day and night. The rivulet
became a torrent. Mark moved up the ridge,
exclaiming as he shook his wet clothes and sur-
veyed the scene, “ Give wings to my soul.” Day
after day the rain kept on. It was ten miles to a
store, backwards over the hill. Between him and
the other store a roaring torrent now rolled. His
rations were done. Anyhow he had but a colour
in the match-box in which he carried his dust. He
could, however, obtain credit if the water would
but let him pass.
He could not ford the torrent, and could not in
such weather and over such country tramp ten
miles. He accordingly arranged the fly of his
tent, huddled himself up, wet as he was, in his
damp quarters, and muttered, “ Give wings to
my soul.”
II
The rain ceased, the creeks fell, and men again
moved to and fro. A horseman travelling west-
ward sighted Mark’s tent, and made for it. He
hallooed lustilyallround the structure,(but received
no answer. He coo-eed towards the top of the
ridge and the bottom and to each side, but with
like result. Then he dismounted and thrust his
head into the tent.
A man lay huddled on the ground. A ’possum-
rug and a fevy other articles of clothing were under
and about him, but he and they were saturated
with wet. The man was emaciated to the con-
dition of a spectre, and his first attempts to move
showed that rheumatism had gripped every joint
m his body.
“Hello !” cried the stranger.
Mark's glassy eyes rolled about, and hisblueish-
white lips emitted a groan as he tried to raise one
shoulder.
“So !” said the stranger, going to his saddle and!
returning with a flask. “Brighten up, friend;:
take a pull at this.”
Mark was willing enough to comply, but physical!
disabilities forbade. In a little while, however,
hesueceeded, and soon was able to rise to his feet.
Did you see it ?” were Mark’s first words.
“See what ?”
“ My soul!”
The stranger looked at him a minute. The eyes
were unmistakably the windows of a mad mind.
I lost my soul,” continued Mark, in a low,
even voice, as he hobbled outside the tent. “ Ite
fluttered off. I was lying down there, with a
piece of damper by my side, when it took flight-
A always had misgivings when I said ‘ Give wings
to my soul.’ How did I know I wouldn’t be
taken at my word ? You see, it cannot last. How~
li’o 33,11 a man live without his soul?”
Soul?” echoed the stranger. “What sort of
thing was that?”
“ 1 can’t say I saw it right. It was dusk at the'
time, and the rain had suddenly stopped. So I
urned over, and lifting a corner of the calico, said’
n surprise, ‘ Give wings to my soul !’ Without a
second s warning it rustled off. The wings went
SW i 1 ( ! and it never came back.”
Berhaps,” said the stranger, “if you got on.
and we went over to the hotel, we might'
Couldn’t leave here on any terms. It must-
e somewhere about, and when it sees the state
am in, it will come back. You have your soul
with you?”
The question was abrupt, and the glassy eyes
rolled greedily over the person of the stranger.
“ Yes. I suppose I have ; such as it is.”
“ A fairly good one ?”
“Yes.”
“ Take care of it, friend, take care of it. The
soul is the only portion of you worth thinking of.
It is your proper self. That’s what few under-
stand. If they lost it, like me, they’d find how
mean and paltry is what stays behind. Mere
rags of flesh, dropping away day by day. The
soul lives for ever I I wonder would it be about
the foot of the gully ?”
But Mark was hardly strong enough to go
alone. The stranger, saying that a companion
would arrive shortly, put the patient sitting on a
log, and proceeded to light a fire to make some
tea.
“Come back,” said Mark, plaintively, looking
through the trees at the foot of the gully, “come
back. I feel I am only a brute until you come
back. I’ll not walk upright any more ; I’ll crawl
on hands and feet, like all other brutes.” Then
he glanced furtively at the stranger, and added,
“ He has a soul!”
There was a heavy wedge of wood lying near
the log. Mark’s eyes rested on it a minute, and
again he muttered— “He has a soul. And,” he
continued, “he doesn’t seem to know the use of
it. If mine won’t come back I might buy his.
But then I have no dust. Well ! ” and he looked
at the billet of wood.
The stranger was on his knees trying to kindle
the damp fibres into a fire. Mark moved noise-
lessly from the log, picked up the billet and
approached the stranger from behind.
In a minute there was a “ woosh!” and both men
rolled in the grass, locked in a savage embrace.

“Of all the bogus science dinned into the
world’s ears medical science, as addressed to men-
tal complaints, is the most colossal fraud. Why,
what do 90 diplomaed men out of 100 know about
psychological derangements? As a mere matter
of fact— can you deny it ? —men get their degrees
in Australian universities without any compulsory
training in psychology at all. Where then is the
cense, when a man’s sanity is under question, in
appealing to such authorities as final judges ? I
have been told it, and on excellent authority, that
men have been hanged in these colonies on medical
testimony as to sanity where the medical men
were known to possess no more special knowledge
■of the subject than the lawyers, the clergymen, or
any other of the merely scholastically-trained per-
sons of the neighbourhood. The fact is that the
average clergyman obtains a better course of
psychological training—a much better—than the
colonial doctor. Yet this latter has actually the
power to send a man to the gallows, sometimes on
this own unsupported testimony, and at other
times with only the corroboration of another like
Mmself. I call this state of things monstrous.”
Dr. Pfeiffer had been nettled by some uncom-
plimentary allusions made to the value of his
foreign distinctions and qualifications. He had
attained an extensive experience in the mad-
houses of Germany and Russia, and on a trip to
Australia had been solicited by the Queensland
■Government to report upon some vexed questions
in connection with the treatment of the insane in
that province. This appointment set the local
medicoes up in arms, and it was to retaliate on
them for their remarks that he wedged into an
after-dinner speech at his club the above denun-
ciation.
On his first asylum visit Dr. Pfeiffer appeared
to be specially struck by the case of Mark Foster.
Mark, he was told, had been an inmate for over
five years and was looked upon now as incurable,
his delusion being that he had lost his soul, and
that, as he could not get it back, he was justified
in taking one when he could. He had killed one
man (for which he was sentenced to be hanged,
for the medical testimony at the trial was to the
effect that Mark was simply a cunning murderer
who concocted the story about his lost soul when
found out), and had attempted the lives of three
others while in confinement.
Dr. Pfeiffer talked with Mark. He listened to
the story, which was told in very much the same
words as when the horseman was listener. He
returned when Mark was in bed. As usual, the
patient was invoking his lost soul to come back.
The doctor joined in the invocation. He went to
the window and opened it. The maniac leaped
from his bed, with hands outstretched, to seize
the doctor by the neck, but the latter was pre-
pared for this and threw him back, without mani-
festing either fear or anger. Then the doctor
talked to him of night and wings in the night; of
lost souls more anxious to find their old bodies
than the bodies were to receive them. He placed
his hands firmly on the shoulders of the maniac,
holding him down, and discoursed rhapsodically,
incoherently perhaps, but with ardour and en-
thusiasm. The talk was all about lost souls,
yearning to return.
He turned to the window. To Mark’s cry,
loud, long, passionate, there came as answer a
swish, a whirr. Wings struck his breast.
IV.
“See here,” said Dr, Pfeiffer, alluding to the
matter afterward ; “no one knows how small a
thing, what a feathery notion, may overbalance
the mind. In some, it is always cn the brink of
the chasm. An instant’s over-excitement or undue
despondency, and it goes. That man, Mark
Foster, was one of these. A bird must have
taken refuge in his tent—possibly the crumbs of
the damper brought it —and on his awakening and
uttering the only poor thing he nursed as a senti-
ment, he look the flight of the frightened bird for
the flight of his soul. The bird I drew in from
the window merely turned his order of thought
back; lifted it back again to the brink of the
chasm. There’s no miracle whatever about it.
He is well now, and may stay so while he lives—
although, of course, no one can be sure.”
The amalgamation of the Exchange Bank
of Australia, Ltd., with the Sydney Deposit Bank,
King-street, is a step in the right direction and as
following in the line of the English banks, a great
number of whom are adopting this satisfactory
method Of concentrating their energies and
capital. The total business of the Exchange
Bank has been merged into .that of the Sydney
Deposit Bank, and under the able management of
Mr. T. S. Richardson, the General Manager, con-
tinued success is 'assured. The latest development
in banking has been promulgated by the Sydney
Deposit Bank who have for some time past given
practical effect to the principle of equitably
dividing banker’s profits with depositors’. The
Exchange Department is very interesting, and
travellers to all parts of the world are informed
that they can obtain or dispose of coins and notes
of all nations, also circular notes of exchange are
issued negotiable in all the principal cities through-
out the world.*

234 Clarence Street, SYDNEY.
A Nhill (Vic.) farmer has raised a cauli-
flower weighing 701 b., measuring 3ft. in diameter*
and 6in. ditto in the stem.
One, Dr. Coruil, stood up in the French
Academy of Medicine the otlur day and unblush-
ingly narrated the result of “experiments of great
scientific interest.” A woman was suffering from
a voluminous breast-tumour. The operator, after
extirpating this tumour, cut off a very small
fragment, and inserted it under the skin of the
other breast, which up to that time was in a
normal condition. This inoculation was made
while the patient was under chloroform with the
most minute antiseptic precautions. Nothing
was observed during the first few days; the skin
was cicatrised, and there was no trace of inflam-
mation. But soon a hard nodule was felt, which
grew, attaining at the end of two months the size
of an almond, and was removed by the same
surgeon.” Dr. Cornil adds, “I received the
fragments of the tumour developed after the
grafting; the tissue of the first and of the second
showed identically the same structure.” He also
recounted another operation of the same kind in
which the poor patient (who was subjected to the
same outrageous cruelty), not wishing to submit
to another operation with the object of removing
the graft, which had become a little tumour, left
the hospital, and had not since been followed up !
“Her Jackeroo.”
He was but a Britisher, it is true, and for many
months succeeding his advent on the Country of
the i achlan his aggravating haw-haw manner and
rather consumptive physique were the scorn of
the loud-voiced, lithe-limbed Australians who
were not afraid of the warrigal, nor timorous in
the pig-hunt. But the little governess at Galah
Station noticed that his voice held music in its
tones, and that his eyes were sympathetic and
dark. And, being of a highly poetic and maternal
nature —rather paradoxical, by the way—she
looked on Henry Grove as her big child, and was
perfectly, though unconsciously, prepared to give
him second place the moment she achieved a child
of her very own. These were the gradations —
first the doll child, then the husband child, and
then the child of the last. He was a colonial-
experience man and had jumped straight from a
clerk’s desk to a jackeroo billet on a sheep-station.
He had been dependent on his clerkship for a
decent living, and ill-health had thrown him out
of that into a mere subsistence. The men of the
station were strong and wild and scornful of
weakness and an incapac’ty and unwillingness
to go out on a periodical drinking-bout. So
Grove knew not them. And his round of duties
made him tired, although he was rapidly securing
sound lungs, and accordingly the super, and the
storekeeper and the other aristocracy of the run
weremot for him either. So he fell back on his
self-appointed mother —the governess, little Ger-
trude Bayley.
The usual result of such a companionship was
forthcoming in this instance. They became
engaged, but Gertrude was Scotchly cautious and
advocated patience.
“Let us wait,’’said she, “until you are quite
well. Then you can go back to an office, and we’ll
get married.” And Grove was forced to be con-
tent with that.”
And so matters remained through the long, wet
winter. August had arrived, and the spreading
stream was beginning to flood and back its waters
for miles over the flats. Every pair of hands was
worth untold gold on the day the water reached
its highest mark, and super. Jackeroo and general
hand were engaged far into the night removing
the stock from positions of danger. The owner
and Ids manager, seeing the water rise as
the night closed in, went down the stream
in the station boat, and brought away all the
women and children but one. They searched for
hours, and then they returned on the back water
and said they thought “the little woman” was
drowned. She had gone to her own room just
before dusk and the water was (> feet deep there
now.
Grove was in agony as he thought on the girl’s
probable fate, and he asked to be allowed to
return to the submerged station.
“ Nonsense, man,” said the manager, “ do you
want to lose your own life too? There’s no hope
for the girl and none for you if you get in there,”
pointing to the racing stream which swept by
them, carrying with it trees, wreckage and the
carcases of drowned sheep and horses.
“If there’s no hope for her, then I don’t want
any for myself,” he replied, and without asking
again for permission, stepped into the boat and
sculled it into the flying water.
It took the boat for a moment broadside on,
threw it like a chip into an eddy and whirled the
little ark on its turbulent bosom.
“Consumptive jackeroo or not,” muttered the
super., “the ringer of us wouldn’t dare more
than
The young man tugged at the oars to warm Ins
chilled blood, for he had been waist-deep in the
water all day. So, aided by his strokes, the boat
rushed through the churning water until, by-and-
bye, he heard a noise as of breakers upon a wind-
swept sea-coast and saw, by the light of the
waning stars, the roofs of the station buildings
groaning and swaying before the weight of the
waters. The flood had spread further, and the
buildings stood in the current.
He fended the boat off from the sides of the
house and guided it through the almost submerged
doorway into what had been the dining-room.
Then, not daring to go further, he raised his voice
above the howl of the hurricane, the rush of the
flood, and the ominous swaying and creaking of
the old homestead, and cried : “ Are you here ?”
Once—twice—no reply, and then a weak voice
said—“ Yes.”
She was within a few feet of him but had been
too weak to speak before. While in her own room,
which was a wooden addition to the main build-
ing, a wall plate had given way and had struck
her, almost stunning her. She had managed to
get on to the dining room table wh ch was of very
heavy and old-fashiom d make, and had heard the
others leave in the boat, but had been too weak to
call. As the flood rose the table had risen with it,
and her only fear had been that she would be
crushed against the ceiling and drowned before
help could come.
As he lifted her tenderly into the boat the
groanings of the doomed house become louder and
the water hissed through the deserted rooms like
a host of serpents. Quickly but steadily he pulled
the boat towards the doorway, passed through it
and headed for the back-water.
The rough oars tore his hands, but ho pressed
on steadily out of the current and had almost
reached the still water when a floating tree struck
the boat and headed her down stream again.
And then there was a sound as of splintering
wood and rending paper, and the homestead, with
one last deep groan and agonised quiver, went
down before the mighty flood.
The boat, despite Grove’s frantic pulling, shot
down the stream like an arrow and passed over
the wrecked building.
And then Grove lost heart and began to joke
feebly.
“ It went first to make a soft bed for us,” he
said.
The boat sped on in the half-darkness and they
had to let her drive without interference until a
new danger threatened them —a great tree-trunk
was racing after their frail craft, and if it struck
them certain death would be the result. In the
face of this peril Grove forgot all fatigue. He
strained at the oars with a perceptibly-increasing
result, but his heart was almost bursting with
exhaustion. A few minutes more and they shot
into smooth water, and the rower, throwing up
his arms, fell backward with the blood oozing
from his pallid lips.
He found himself in a small lessee’s hut next
morning, feeling slightly better for the rough
surgery and make-shift febrifuges administered
him. But then, during the day all his hereditary
gouty deposit evidenced itself, and the wetting of
the previous day brought as its punishment
a neuralgic rheumatism in the hip and knee that
was almost maddening.
And, as is usual in these cases, he became very
irritable with his best friends. Gertrude was well
enough to attend him now, and he watched her
trim little figure brightening that rude hut, to his
eyes, into a palace, and wished that she and the
hut were Ins.
“ I suppose this will put off our marriage again,”
he said grumblingly between the more acute
paroxysms of his pain.
“Well, dear, it certainly keeps us all the
longn- away from the necessary means to start
housekeeping with.”
“You’d better leave me altogether,” he spoke
gaspingly in his agony. “I’m only a drag on
you, and now I’m helpless and only fit for a
coffin.”
But in an instant she was at the side of her big
baby with tender words that quickly dissipated
the gloomy future he had imagined. He wanted
calming in this fashion a dozen times a day.
A few days later she brought him a ticket of
which this is a copy :
Please give
Mr. Grove a bath.
Alf. Lepage.
“You’re to ask no questions, but to go to that
address in Melbourne as soon as you're tit to be
removed.” IShc said, and her wish was law.
They waited a week for an improvement suffi-
cient to warrant the journey, but it did not
appear, and then Grove, longing for re’ief at any
cost, resolved to bear the coach-ride to Hay, the
nearest railway-station, and then to travel round-
about by rail through Albury to Melbourne.
The day after his arrival in the Southern capital
he was carried into a cab and driven to the address
in Lonsdale-street on the ticket given him by his
fiancEe-mother. And over the doors of the large
two-storied building he read the words “The
Bethel Electric Medical Baths Co.” Then he was
carried into the bath, but an hour later could
almost put his feet on the ground as he was helped
out. He had baths every day, and wrote telling
his sensations in his letters to Gertrude.
“As soon as I get the strong currents on,” he
wrote, “ I can almost feel the agony and the old
dead flesh and blood leaving me, and the new li e
of strength coming on. There is no shock per-
ceptible, only a gentle flow of electricity that is
really pleasurable. And the current sensitises the
water, so that you are half floating in liquid waves
of strength—quite different to the waves we
experienced that awful night, I can tell you. That
was the bane and this is the certain antidote.”
“You do not know nor can you imagine,” he
wrote a week later, “ what an utterly new man I
feel. All the nerve-pains are gone, and my
breathing is immensely improved. I intend to
use these Bethel Baths until I am as strong as that
b g man on the old station who used to knock
down horses with his fist. This Bethel— who
sounds Wesleyan but is merely inventive and
commercial —has cured my rheumatics and strung
my nerves again, and I intend that his baths shall
deaden my lung-disease before I come back to
make you Mrs. Groves.”
Well, three weeks later Henry Groves went
back to Galah with a wedding-ring in his pocket
and a strange and almost foreign strength in his
limbs.
This story has to end with a wedding, but its
climax might have been a funeral, and little Miss
Bayley would certainly have died a governess had
not that bath-order happened along in time.

The Story of a Vagrant.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Arthur Jubbins, junior clerk in the Bank of
, Durran, stood on the footpath one
morning about eight years ago, just outside the
bank door. It was not the custom of the bank’s
officers thus to occupy their spare time, though it
was the practice of the clerks in the employ of
Messrs. Dolby and Co., auctioneers, a few doors
higher up, and the young man in the office of
Wakem, the solicitor, a few doors lower down ;
but on this morning, an autumn one, the sun
poured down such deliciously warm rays upon the
footpath, that Arthur Jubbins who was writing
with numbed fingers and chilled blood, felt he
could “ stand it ” no longer, but must go out and
bask in it for a while.
Mr. Jubbins had stood outside his office but a
few moments when his curiosity was excited by
the figure of a swagman some 50 yards distant. It
was not that swagmen were ram avi in the
streets of the pr saio town; but this particular
swagman bore his swag with an apparently
haughty sense of protest—as if it did not belong
to him at all—and, withal, looked so uncommonly
like a “gentleman whohadseen better days” that
Mr. Jubbins turned hastily into the bank and
implored the accountant to watch the swell-mob
swagman go by. To John Field, a new-chum,
swagman were still objects of interest, and his
lively junior never neglected an opportunity of
bringing under his notice anything of “bush”
life that he thought would find a place in Mr.
Field’s next home letter. The next moment the
svvell-swagmen arrived outside the bank window,
and he was observed to halt and study the name
of the bank where it glistened in gold letters on
the wire blind. Then he walked in.
Beyond doubt he was a gentleman. John Field
recognised this fact at a glance. It did not matter
that the stranger’s clothes were dusty and weather-
stained and patohed-up, and with patches that did
not match, and that he bore upon his shoulder a
rolled-up blue blanket, which, with a sense of
relief and proud submission to his hard lot, he
unslung from his shoulder and cast at his feet.
There were two gentlemen in the room—John
Field, the official, dressed in tweeds, and the
swagman, clothed in rags; and the recognition of
personal equality was mutual. Addressing him-
self to Field, the latter said, “Pardon me”—in
a clear, cultivated voice—“have you an officer
in your service by the name of fit. John Bute-
Dalzell ? ”
The enquiry was so different in purpose from
what the accountant had prepared himself to hear,
with his fingers handling some small coin in the
till, that for the moment he was taken back,
looked confused and turned to the junior—Mr.
Jubbins-standing at his elbow, from whom he
enquired—
“ Do you know that name ?”
“ There was a Bute-Dalzell in this Bank a few
years ago, bub I have heard that he left it to go to
Queensland.”
An expression of acute disappointment came
over the face of the stranger as he listened to this
statement of Jubbins. He turned to John Field.
“ This is bad news for me,” he said, “ er—he is
my brother —and I half expected to find him at
this office.”
“Oh, indeed,” John Field remarked, his eyes
speaking an eager sympathy.
‘‘This sort of thing,” and the stranger cast his
eyes over himself as he spoke, “ rather discredits
my statement.”
“ Adversity may overtake all of us, youknow,”
Field responded with delicate interest.
“It does indeed—and I ought not to be in this
position. When my brother, St. John, joined this
bank I was principal of a Melbourne college, but,
however, that’s neither here nor there. I have
just come over from Sydney, where I was chief
leader-writer on the Commercial Thunderblast.”
John Field listened attentively, but without
interrupting, and the ex-guide of Sydney public
opinion, continued;
“ A little friction occurred between myself and
the editor. I was bound to respect my scruples—
and—er—-I suggested, in short, that we were not
in sympathy in our views. In short, I handed in
my pen.
“ I had plenty of money—the Thunderblast
paid well—so I travelled to the Temora rush. I had
bad luck there, lost all, and had to take to the
‘ wallaby ’—as it is called ” —(he pointed sarcasti-
cally to the humble burden at his feet). “I have
managed pretty well to work my way so far. I
am now making for Melbourne, where I have
plenty of friends.” Here he stooped down,
picked up his blue-blanket bundle, and threw it
carelessly over his shoulder, where it sat as
awkwardly as a monkey on the pole of a street-
organ. John Field, who had been much in-
terested in the ragged gentleman’s story,
remarked, kindly—“ Your friends in Melbourne
will help you ? ”
The blue-blanket bundle was dropped on the
floor again, and the owner advanced close to the
counter. “My friends in the metropolis,” ho
said, speaking under a reserve that was plain was
painful to him, “are wealthy and influential,
and have urged me to rejoin them—but pride—
you understand ?”
John Field acquiesced, with a delicate assent
that bespoke a courteous sympathy with the
genteel hardship before him.
“However, 1 am endeavouring now to make
my way down to those friends, and am travelling
by stages to Warradambra, where I have a friend
who will put me right.”
The gentleman in rags paused at this juncture.
Then he went on again, a faint blush pervading
his features : ...
“Painful necessities are sometimes imposed
upon us. The fare by train to Warradambra I
have ascertained to be 7s. fid. It is unfortunate
for me that I have only 45.”
Contrary to the gentleman-in-rags expectations,
John Field, the gentleman-in-tweed did no more
than to listen courteously. He did not volunteer
the expected delicate assistance which rendered
the situation painfully embarrassing to the dis-
tressed speaker, who continued ; “ Would it be
an unpardonable presumption on my part as
brother to a former officer of the bank to ask you
for the loan of —— ? I desire you will under-
stand it to be a loan merely of the few shillings
necessary to carry me on to Warradambra?”
Thus appealed to there was nothing left for the
accountant, having an open till before him, but to
hand to his visitor the sum indicated, which he
did with generous sympathy.
“You will give me your card,” the recipient
observed graciously, his voice trembling with
gratitude ere scraping into his hand from the
counter the “loan,” “and when I reach Mel-
bourne I shall take the earliest opportunity of
refunding this —this loan. I shall never forget
your consideration —never ! I am very much
obliged to you—good morning.” So saying, in a
voice betraying much emotion, the brother, whose
brother was at one time in the bank, withdrew
from the institution, looking even when his back
was turned, a gentleman—aye, every inch.
• » «
Field has now obtained a managership and a
wife, and resides in another part of the country;
and Arthur Jubbins has graduated through the
several stages of promotion, and is himself an
accountant of the bank at an equally important
township, as remote from Durran as the boun-
daries of the colony will permit. Folks who
knew him eight years ago as junior clerk at
Durran no longer recognise him now in his altered
condition of person and fortune. A month ago—
just about eight years since the morning on which
he discovered the “ swell swagman ” coming down
the street of Durran, Jubbins was writing up his
books behind the counter, when the glass door of
his office opened, and a tall, haughty-looking, but
shabbily-dressed individual entered, bearing on
his shoulder a blue-blanket bundle. He looked a
gentleman, despite the raggedness and dust-
stained character of his attire. Yes, above all, he
looked a gentleman, though a gentleman whose
“ better days ” had long gone by.
“ This is the Bank of , I believe,” began
the somewhat haughty, if dilapidated, visitor.
Jubbins assented.
“ Have you an officer in your service by the
name of St. John Bute-Dalzell?”
“We had at one time,” responded Jubbins,
readily, “ but he has quitted the service for some
years. ”
The stranger looked disappointed; then,
brightening up in a moment, he remarked : “Ah,
of course—we have lost the run of each other of
late years—er —he is my brother.”
“ Oh, indeed,” Mr. Jubbins remarked, with
neutral interest.
“That announcement, coupled with my per-
sonal appearance”—and he cast his eyes over him-
self with a well-bred shrug—“will somewhat
surprise you, I have no doubt. But I have met
with misfortunes. I formerly held the position of
principal of College, in Melbourne. I have
just now come over from Sydney, where I was
editor of the Thunderblast. I am in rather an
unfortunate dilemma at the present moment—ef—
I have wealthy and influential friends in the
metropolis, and am anxious to get to Orville to-
night, but I find the fare is seven shillings, and—
really I am ashamed to mention it—when
seeking my ticket at the booking-office I found
I had but three shillings and sixpence about me.”
“ Yes, that is very awkward,” Mr. Jubbins
remarked, coolly.
The distressed visitor continued, with an em-
barrassment of manner pa nful to contemplate—
“ I can assure you the position forced upon me is
very painful to my feelings, and had not my
brother been in this bank I could not bring my-
self to ask of you the loan—only as a loan, you
must understand—of the deficient sum—”
He would have continued, but that Jubbins
broke in with the remark, “It is unfortunate
that you should have happened to call at this
office.”
The other lifted his eyebrows, by way of in-
quiry, but did not speak. He was too well-bred
in manner to attempt.
“Yes,” said Jubbins, as uming the facial
aspect of a judge about to put on the black cap,
ere he proceeded in a calm and deliberate manner
to recall to his mind a visit paid to the bank at
Durran some eight years previously, under
circumstances not dissimilar to the present. He
did not forget to dwell upon his friend
Field’s generosity, which had never been
repaid or acknowledged in any way, nn<j
finally wound up with a scathing denuncia-
tion of the other’s iniquity and impudence.
As soon as he delivered himself of the last word,
however, the miserable culprit remarked calmly—
“ But you won’t refuse me the trifling loan I have
asked, surely ? ”
Jubbins was aghast. “What! ”he exclaimed,
“are you really serious? Why, you must talcs
me for a fool, or a child. To my knowledge now,
you have been travelling for eight years on this
‘racket,’ and yet you—you can stand there and
ask me to help you.”
“Then you refuse to assist? It is a trifling
sum and won’t hurt you.”
“ I do 1 ” shouted Jubbins emphatically.
“Then you are not the man I took you for
and, setting his blue-blanket burden upon his fine,
square shoulders, the dust-stained but gentle-
manly-looking swagman withdrew, gentlemanly
asever.
PELICAN.
A few weeks ago it was announced that
the French, German, and Austrian troops were in
future to be armoured with cuirasses; and now
the further intelligence comes along that every
Swiss soldier is to carry a tin-opener among his
equipment. This looks like business. When the
German enemy comes along in his bullet-proof
case the Swiss warrior will seize him in a calmly
practical way, and open his outer husk with his
tin-opener ; and then he will pick out the occu-
pant, and throw him away down a crevasse. ■

Thus an irreverent contemporary :•*—
The state of California should get a new design for the
marriage licenses vended by county ‘clerks at two,dollars
apiece. The present instrument’ is disfigured with a
picture of an unattractive pair of human beings standing
before a clergyman, in the garb of the Episcopal priest-
hood, with an altar in the foreground. State documents
should have the insignia of the commonwealth upon
them. We therefore move the elimination of the minister
and altar from the marriage license, and the substitution
of a grizzly bear.

In sad, but loving remembrance of my dear husband, Peter
Seres, who was killed at the Lambton Sinking Pit, by
, v the breaking of an old rope, on the 12th October,
1869, leaving me with three children—one three weeks
old—to mourn their sad loss. Also, my beloved hus-
band, Thomas Gillons, who was killed through an old
boiler bursting, at Lambton Middle Pit, June 28,
1890, leaving me one son to mourn his sad loss. Also,

parted this life on October, 14, 1890, leaving five

■ The people of Chicago intend to construct
a new Leaning Tower, after the model of the
-ancient wonder of Pisa. The venerable Italian
castle is 13ft. out of the perpendicular, and the
question that puzzles all antiquarians is—how the
deuce it got to that awful angle and yet didn’t
finish the job by falling over altogether. The new
pork city means to go one better, however, by
sloping its tower 100 ft. off the straight, so as to
make it seven and a half times the more remark-
able of the two. After all, the Yankee is not so
inventive as he looks. He licks creation at copy-
ing the marvels of other lands, and making the
copy 18 times bigger than the original, and as a
fair sample of this weakness he is going to have
the biggest exhibition on record with an Eiffel
Tower several times more gigantic than the
original, and a Leaning Tower in red railway-iron
that leans seven times harder than any such thing
ever leaned before. He wanted also to get the
bones of Columbus and show them round, but as
the Spaniards haughtily declined to dig up their
old hero from his resting-place, he will probably
make a hardwood skeleton of a Columbus 12ft,
high, and show it instead. And then, by the
bye, he will build some fresh pyramids that will
lick Cheops into fits, and put a bogus, dog-skin
Pharoah inside; for the modern American is pas-
sionately fond of antiquities, only he likes to have
them new and fresh and in good condition. He
is a strange individual —a wild symphony in red
paint and pork and pills—full of weird enthu-
siasms and gold-stopped teeth : and for selling a
time-payment organ, or for buying the sacred
scenes of Galilee cheap, and digging them up, and
transplanting them bodily to New York, and then
turning a brass band loose upon them and charging
10 cents admission, he has no equal.
Purves, Q. 0., performed one of his sur-
prising feats as a cross-examiner in the M'Meokan
will-case the other day, when he got a doctor in
the box, and made him faint by reading to him
one of the items out of his own bill. That is to
say, he grasped the bill in his hand, and impaled
the doctor with his eye, and then he read the item
over about 16 times-, till his witness nearly died
through the horrible iteration* There isn’t so
very much in being a great cross-examiner after
all, and Purves’s method is often very simple. He
gets a nervous Witness before him, and looks at
him for a moment •or two with rage and thunder
in his eye. Then he leans towards him, and says
iii a hollow, menacing tone like a dog barking into
an empty jam-tin : “ Is that letter in your hand-
writing?” The witness answers promptly : “It
is.” “Did you write that letter?” The man in
the box looks a little surprised, but replies again :
“ I did.” “Do you mean to tell me ” but
when he has got as far as this the lawyer stops as
if overcome and broken up and shattered by the
astonishing nature of the situation. Then he pulls
himself together, and you can hear the gurgle in
his aorta as he clutches a double handful of papers,
and starts again in a Johnel Sullivan voice : “ DO
you mean to tell me that you— you — you wrote that
letter—DO you say that you would write SUCH
(fearful howl on the “such”) a document as
THAT ? ” (unearthly scream on the “ that ”).
Here the witness staggers and turns pale
and feels that he must have ruined his reputation
somehow over the letter, though there is nothing
in it but a bald statement that he had lost the
9.30 train, and, consequently, couldn’t go some-
where till next morning. But he feebly admits
over again that he wrote it. Then the barrister
turns pale with excitement and suppressed frenzy,
and grabs all the papers on the table, and, with a
shriek that wakes his wife and family in the next
province, he wades in, and the place seems to be
filled with a tangled waste of barks and vocifera-
tions. This time he speaks all in big capitals, and
the smallest words-nearly lift the roof. “DO
YOU ACTUALLY STATE YOU WROTE
THAT LETTER ?” The testifier feels that the
Last Day has come, and collapsing in the box,
says, “I did.” The lawyer glares horribly in the
empty air : wildly casts his papers at the roof;
and for want of anything else'to seize he grabs
the table itself, and with it in his arms fires his
last howl. “ You DID ! ! !!” There is no answer,
for the witness is in an insensible condition on
the floor. That is the way to: be a Great Cross-
examiner. c

My lot has been so hard
To see two able-bodied men
Cut off without a word.
And I am left to do my best;

They seem to take no notice.
The dead, they feel no pain ;

Although the ropes and boilers
Were not worth a snuffer.

At the conclusion of the Wiltshire murder
trial, at Adelaide, at which trooper Willshiro
was honourably acquitted, his boss, Police Com-
missioner Peterswald, ostentatiously shook hands
with him.
Dear Bulletin, — It was Detective “Dick”
Elliott, now retired, and who may be seen any day
on the King-street (Sydney) block— not Mr.
Inspector Oamphin, who “dropped” to Nichols’
and Lester’s little game in the advertising line.
Elliott had had Nichols in his care some years
previously for forgery or something of that sort,
and recognised his handwriting the moment he
saw it. Oamphin arrested the miscreant Lester,
alias Froude. The latter was said to be highly
connected.—F.
A wandering revivalist has been warming
up a Maoriland town lately. Hand bills were
scattered broadcast h aded, “A voice from tho
Condemned Cell,” and setting forth that the Rev.
John Mac Neill, 8.A., will “deliver a message
from a young man executed in Sydney in connec-
tion with the Mount Rennie outrage,” and invites
all, “especially young men and young women.”
The rev. gentleman, according to an M.L. paper,
has had packed houses—especially of women. He
takes up a collection at the end to defray
expenses. Rev. Butcher Yarley might here learn
a wrinkle er two.
Lord Normauby : “I believe that women
have no appreciation of simplicity in dress, nor in
anything else. I believe that the more a man
bedizens himself with velvet, satin, gold chains,
rings on his firrgers, and varnished boots, tho more
they admire him. For example, for seven years I
carried a cane which I felt was a degradation to
me. It was a brown cane; the upper part
was made entirely of turquoises ; it was a most
disreputable cane. It Was given to me. So long
as I carried that cane I was ail powerful. Every
woman succumbed the moment she saw that
cane; they felt that therein was wealth, splendor,
etc. I lost it. From that hour my power ceased,
and I never regained it.”
The Maorilanders are thinking of sending
P. A. Buckley, of the Upper House, home to
London to be their new Agent-General. Buckley
is a loud and warlike Irishman, and the Upper
House would be glad to get rid of him, for he is
not solemn enough for the billet. He has no
extraordinary intelligence, but still lie has about
enough to crowd through, and he has two great
qualifications for the ambassador's job. First, he
can speak quite a lot of languages, most of them
pretty badly, so that if any foreign power wanted
to take his country in he could go out and talk to
it, and as neither party would be likely to know
what the other was saying no bad results could
very well ensue. Secondly, he is not likely to
ooinmit hMs country to any warlike experiments,
or to encourage any Soudan contingents or
similar foolishness, for he took a hand in a con-
tingent himself when young, and there was so
little glory and so much hunger and mud and
rheumatism, that he is most unlikely to want any
more of the kind. Buckley went out along with a
good many other Irishmen to fight for the Holy
Father, against Garibaldi’s rod-shirts, and very-
few @f that Irish Brigade over came back- They
got no pay, very little provisions, and a good deal
of the Holy Father’s benediction. Some of them
were killed in battle; and a lot more were
wounded, and then some amateur surgeon tried to
amputate their damaged limbs with an axe and a
shovel, and finished them off. Some of them were
left crippled on the field, ere a kindly Garibaldian
came along and finished them with a fence-rail,
for the Liberator’s army consisted of a lot of nob e
patriots in front and a lot of irredeemable ruffians
behind. Some of them were captured and hung
surreptitiously ; some disappeared mysteriously 0
others eloped with strange Italian females whose
husbands followed them and shot them in the
night; and a few got into trouble through serenad-
ing girls whs didn’t belong to them. And taking
them all round they had a very bad time, and
Buckley has never gone fighting for any other
Holy Father from that day till this.
The great official intellect shines out very
conspicuously whenever it gets a fair chance.
When some poor wretch has been run in, and his
clothes embezzled, and his boots collared, and his
hat boned, for the same reason, the police
straightway communicate a paragraph to the
evening papers setting forth that they want an
owner for one blue tweed overcoat, one pair gray
pants slightly frayed at the feet, serge jacket, and
waistcoat, and a silver Waltham watch, &c.
Then in about half an hour the air is full of men
all in want of an outfit, and all bounding madly to
the police-office to claim the property. And
the description furnished by every one of
them agrees so exactly with the descrip-
tion m the newspaper that there isn’t the
slightest doubt that the whole lot of them is the
only real owner. The world is choke-full of
owners—it is the property that isn’t sufficiently
copious to go round. Meanwhile the man who
was,arrested is under lock and key so that he
can’t bound in with the rest and lodge a des-
cription and claim the goods, sonsequently, who-
ever gets the things, he is left every time. And it
never seems to strike anybody that the system
too brilliant and too successful
for if the police arrested the Union Bank, and
then announced that an owner was wanted for a
eapjtd of £1,000,000 and a reserve fund of
£BOO,OOO, both of which were awaiting identifica-
tion, somebody would burst round the corner a
minute later, and prove that he had lost these
u 4 s , a hancJ y wa y of getting a winter
outfit the best dodge we know is claiming stolen
property, and the next best dodge is identifying
lost luggage at the railway station. N.B. To
work this last dodge inquire either for a well-worn
travelling bag with a number of defaced labels on
ior else for a tin trunk. There are always about
wo dozen lost articles of each sort, and the man
vfio °an t lodge a description that will ITit one out
“.wt had hotter give up the trade and turn
'°?. es . t ; But don’t go beyond these limits. The
individual who attempts to define a lost hat-box
or a wooden trunk that he never saw before, is
ure to get fife. Hat-boxes and wooden trunks
are too various.

Illustrated London News (which is
understood to be the Liberal paper of its class —
the Graphic is Tory), in describing Miss Albeita
Victoria Ponsonby’s wedding, pours out the
following sickening slush at the loot of the altar
and throne :
The lucky man to whom this prize has fallen is Col.
Montgomery, of Grey Abbey, County Down. Col. Mont-
gomery served with distinction in the Zulu War of 1879,
but military renown fades before the achievement of
marrying a god daughter of the Queen, and in the pre-
sence of snch an array of Royalty as seldom graces the
domestic festivities of subjects.
Bwoogh ! Military renown is in itself a ghastly
glitter that lowers the human race, especially when
the hireling butcher, at the nod of a king,
goes forth to kill half-armed niggers at so much a
day ; but this sort of greasy grovel suggests quag-
mires alive with slimy, wriggling worms and
squash-toads, and limbless, foul-smelling, squirm-
ing reptiles. The English illustrated press is the
stipendiary agent of Loyalty, which is another
name for the apotheosis of vulgarity. It deifies
insignificance, ennobles sordid wealth, shores tp
the rotten edifice of hereditary titledom, and pre-
sents to the human eye as refined and artistic all
that is really coarse and revolting in the realms
o c caste and privilege. The heavy-jowled, heavy-
feeding Guelphs are, in its pages, beautiful for
ever. The coarse, sensual Royal glutton is tin
Apollo—the vacuous stare of hopeless imbecility
is carefully extracted from the long face of his
nibs with the sheep-hurdle collar. The British
illustrated paper is nothing but a Royal posting-'
bill, and we never look at its Royal processions
unless the doctor has ordered us an emetic.

Two Men Wrong—One Man Right.
“ You will be in kingdom-come in less than twelve
months! ”
“ You can't live three years I ”
“ You are not going to die! ”
These three prophecies were addressed to the
same man. The last one had the most comfort in
it, yet he couldn’t tell which had the most inspira-
tion.
Here’s the story. It isn’t pleasant reading at
first, but it “ comes out ” all right, as the children
say. _ .
Perhaps it’s better to let our friend tell it him-
self. We all like the pronoun “I,” that’s why
an autobiography is never dull. This relator is a
butcher of Auckland, N. Z., and his style is so
clear and good, it needs no editing.
He says ; “ Some five years ago, when lifting a
quarter of beef, I noticed a remarkable soreness in
the small of my back. I called a doctor, gave up
business, and took to my bed. He prescribed a
lotion to be rubbed in around the region of the
kidneys. This was done, and I remained in bed
several days, suffering excrutiating agony. At
last, haying examined the kidney secretions, the
doctor said, ‘You have Bright’s disease, and will
be in kingdom-come in less than twelve months,’
“Never believing I had Bright’s disease, I
thought, however, it would be as well to insure
my life. On examination, the company’s physician
refused to pass me for life insurance, saying,
‘ You can’t live three years.’
“About three months afterwards I was again
seized with a severe attack, and went about more
dead than alive. Finally I broke down and again
took to my bed, as was supposed, for the last
time, I sold one of my businesses so as not to
leave too many affairs for my wife to sunervise,
made my will, and explained to my wife what to
do in case of my death. I can well remember her
listening with tears in her eyes to what she be-
lieved were my last instructions. I then lingered
for some weeks, waiting for death to free me from
my sufferings-taking whatever medicines were
prescribed, but deriving little or no relief.
“One evening a friend called, and we talked
over my case and the very serious turn it had
taken. Presently he said, ‘You are not going to
die. Have you tried Seigel’s Syrup yet ? ’
“ I confessed that I had not. In fact, I had
religiously followed the instructions of my medical
advisers. My friend persuaded me to try Seigel’s
Syrup, and I began at on»e, taking twenty-drop
doses according to the directions. In about a
week I felt a little more life in me, and after
having finished the second bottle I was convinced
that improvement had fairly set in. I continued
taking the Syrup until I had consumed ten bottles,
then went downstairs to work again, still using
the Syrup. After having taken from eighteen to
twenty bottles altogether, I found myself entirely
well. It is now four years since I took my last
dose of Mother Seigel’s Syrup for Bright’s disease
of the kidneys, and I have suffered no symptoms
of kidney complaint since.
“ (Signed) Robert Hutchinson, Butcher.
Wellington-street, Auckland, New Zealand.”
We print Mr. Hutchinson’s statement as he
wrote it, yet it is not probable that his malady
was actually Bright’s disease, as that is a degenera-
tion or destruction of the substance of the kidneys,
and difficult, if not impossible, to cure. What he
really suffered from was, no doubt, a debilitated
state of the system, originating in indigestion and
dyspepsia, with severe kidney symptoms, as is often
the ease. When we remember that nearly all
maladies, including rheumatism, gout, consump-
tion, liver complaint, heart disease, &c., are due
to poisons in the blocd, arising from fermented
food in the digestive tract, we can see why Mother
Seigel’s Syrup is victorious over so great a variety
of apparently diverse diseases. And because of
the one source of these complaints, serious and
often fatal mistakes are made in the diagnosis and
in the treatment. The point to emphasise is this :
Heart disease, consumption, and Bright’s disease
are much rarer than they are supposed to be.
Generally what seems like them is a group of
symptoms of indigestion and dyspepsia. It is
always best to take the advice of Mr, Hutchinson’s
friend when he said, “You are not going to die ;
try Seigel's Syrup.”
Men Who Rose from the Ranks.
This is the heading of a paragraph in a Sydney
weekly, conducted by a family of eminently pious
professing Christians. Amongst others they
mention that “ Brindley, the engineer, Captain
Cook, the famous navigator, and Robert Burns,
the poet, were originally ordinary day labourers.”
That's all perhaps they were.
Then they give us some masons and bricklayers.
I’ll come to them last.
But take this ;
The carpenter's shop has given us Inigo Jones, the
architect; Harrison, the famous chronometer-maker; John
Hunter, the eminent physiologist; Romney and Opie, the
painters ; Professor Lee, the great Oriental scholar ; and
John Gibson, the sculptor.
Are these the biggest swells you can mention ?
Don’t you think, in common decency, you ought
to have put in the Carpenter who, to this day, has
such a crowd of followers? Shame on you ! That
is, if you believe what you pretend.
Then you name Arkwright, Tenterden, and
Turner as barbers. Not a word about the woman
who stopped the Syrian Jack the Ripper by shav-
ing his head.
Lindsay, the ship-owner, was a cabin-boy. So
was the man who lived under a pumpkin-vine and
afterwards in the innards of a cretacean ; at least,
he was entered on the books at a shilling a month.
But your masons and bricklayers do get
me. You can’t have forgotten the poor widow’s
son whose name is at the bottom of this para-
graph. He is said to have taken a big hand in the
building of a finer tabernacle thananyPresbyterian
show you may sleep in. But the contemptuous
way in which you mention the different trades !
Don’t, brother or brethren Smoothfacts, sneer at
labourers in contradistinction to the condition to
which they have risen (?) Of the fifteen or twenty
you mention two at least were drunkards, two
others were accused of peculation. I remember
well when a fifth one of them shot himself, and, if
you wish to give your female relatives a treat, I’ll
mark a page or two of the writings of another for
a Sunday afternoon’s quiet reading in their
boudoirs.
I now caH to your mind another mason or
bricklayer. Perhaps you know more about him
than I do. I refer to Him who built the High
Heavenly Temple.

Such is the mocking song of the Melbourne

hungry unemployed for a free meal.

An unemployed painter and house-
decorator applied verbally for the vacant position

“looked more like stone-breaking,” and, indeed,
he deserved the compliment. Precedent decrees
that only a pompous toady can adequately fill the
vacant stool.
The operation of the Queensland act which
empowers local bodies to rate on the unimproved
land values is making the Brisbane capitalist sit
up. One big city firm had their rateable
value raised to £61,000 and rose up to object there-
to; but as they’ve a £40,000 building on the land
and an £BO,OOO mortgage over the lot—a mortgage
being generally estimated at one third of the
security—they sat down and paid up or will pay
up when the time comes unless they’ve sold out to
somebody else." Which reminds us that financing
is a varied and peculiar thing, for one of the partners
valued the property on behalf of the company
making the advance and the other as a director
thereof solemnly assisted in authorising same.
Wherefore we fancy the Municipal Council might
as well have stuck on another £lOO,OOO and then
sent round its collector in the sure and certain
hope of gathering in the greed.

appear to think, actuated by mere love of money,

A Melbourne barber, in Melbourne, re-
cently filed his schedule and set down his assets as
a razor and pole. Which reminds us that, under
the old law, Judge Barry (Vic.) had a petition for
sequestration put before him, in forma pauperis,
wherein the assets were set down as nil! “ What’s
this, sir?” said the Judge, in his pompous way.
“ I wish to sequestrate my estate, your Honor ! ’
humbly responded the bankrupt. “Estate !
Estate! You have none, your assets are nil! Go
and buy a razor and set your assets down at one
shilling, and bring your petition back to me.”
The poor bankrupt did as directed, surrendered
the razor to the assignee, and was whitewashed
accordingly.

The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress ; it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege —the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, IHE
Bulletin will fearlessly apd ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to tne
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of ion'te
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ ot tne
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletins
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact
easily ascertainable from any postal official-Imu,
of all journals issued in Australasia, iHE dui.
letin is the one most frequently remaned iron
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in i K
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original an
specially-written reading matter is the brign
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and i
artistic, and its policy the boldest ami m
straightforward ever submitted to the Austra
public.

or other articles of leather by means of a sponge, attached
to the cork by a wire, so that the blacking can be used by
anyone without soiling the fingers. No polishing brush
is required. It dries immediately after being applied, and
will not soil the most delicate clothing.

To H. F. KbOELMANN, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, w
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, whii
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. 1 consult
more than one doctor, and during that time took a gre
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slighte
good, but 1 became worse every day, wasting away urn
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last I bogs
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and seve
pains m my left lung, and the quantity of bad mattei
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarme
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, ar
you told me you could cure me for a given sura. I agree*
and went under your treatment in March last. At tl
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, ar
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and strim
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, ar
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago tl
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and tl
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pr
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
