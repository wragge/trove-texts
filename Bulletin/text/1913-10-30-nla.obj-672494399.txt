Amiwud is the
Ideal Material
for Ceilings and
Wails.
If you don’t know the score of uses to which AMIWUD—the imitation hardwood—is used, you should write to
us for our Printed Matter. AMIWUD is made to look exactly like hardwood—in fact, the colorings and
markings of the various woods are faithfully REPRODUCED by a new process. When AMIWUD is up, you
can’t tell it from hardwood, yet it costs but a fraction of the cost of hardwood. It is sold in large sheets, which
are tacked to the studs of the house direct, or, in the case of a remodelled house, to the existing walls.

Dostoevsky
The Red page
The second volume of the novels of that
Russian genius, Fyodor Dostoevsky, to reach
the English reader thrdugh the admirable
translation of Constance Garnett, is The
Idiot (Ileinemann, per Dymock’s Library),
This novel does not reach the extreme length
of the first volume in this series, The
Brothers Karamazov, reviewed last year on
this page, nevertheless it exceeds GOO pages
of close type. In style the two works are
identical—and Dostoevsky’s style is unmis-
takable. The Idiot repeats all the charac-
teristics of The Brothers Karamazov; the
book has the same formlessness, the same
leisurely and haphazard progress from inci-
dent to incident, the same divaga-
tions from the central theme, the Same
preoccupation with minor characters,
holding up the story to tell their
story, the same inconsequence. Here, as in
his other work, the novelist crowds his stage
with characters, and the story proceeds from
one drunken orgie to another, from passion
to crime, from pathos to horror.
J*
But, one cannot help wondering, are these
mostly objectionable people, these extraor-
dinarily'loquacious people, these treacherous,
lying, mean, unmannerly, drunken, passion-
ate, beastly people, the modern Russians?
Surely the Russian, as modern travellers
have described him, is a cheerful and jovial
soul, surely he is something more than a de-
generate. a brute, a fool or a dreamer? We
have been told that Jerome K. Jerome and
VY eiis and Dickens are universally read in
modern Russia. It is impossible to con-
ceive any one of the many characters that
throng about “The Idiot” as delighting in, or
even as reading, Dickens. For one thing,
he or she would not have the time. Each
would be much' too busy explaining his or
her soul.
Dostoevsky gives us the impression that a
human being might feel’if fearfully peering
over the- rim of the planet Mars. These
strange Dostoevskians belong to another
race—a most interesting race, but swayed
by ideals inconceivable to us, and motived
by an automatism inexplicable. Peering at
them over the rim of our English hori-
zon. we find them quite objectionable beings
—a race with which it would be waste of
time to communicate; and yet. once Dosto-
evsky forces us to know them from the in-
side^—as he does with his merciless psycho-
logy—the “pattern in the carpet” becomes
suddenly clear. These beings have souls;
they are human. More, they have remark-
ably interesting souls. And it is only with
the souls of good in these things evil that
this Russian interpreter has to do. Things
happen, tragedies take place, dramas of
passion unfold, interminable conversations
go on....and behind these trivial screens of
action the souls of the actors persist un-
changed, untroubled. That, to Dostoevsky,
is the only thing that matters. And to
Dostoevsky it greatly matters.
J*
“The Idiot” is a prince without a patri-
mony, a gentle Christ-like soul (who yet
can get drunk cheerfully), an epileptic (as
was his creator),• but the one sincere and
honest person amid this horde of quasi-
ruffians, impostors and snobs. The idiot
offers this explanation of himself: —
He told me that he had come to the con-
clusion that I was a complete child myself,
altogether a child; that it was only in face
and figure that I was like a grown-up per-
son. but that in development, in soul, in
character, and perhaps in intelligence, I was
net grown up, and that so I should renfain,
if I lived to be GO. ,1 laughed very much.
He was wrong, of course, for I am not a
child. But in one thing lie is right: I don’t
like being with grown-up pe0p1e....1 don’t
know how to get on with them.... Everyone
looks on me as an idiot, too, for some rea-
son. I was so ill at one time that I really
was almost like an idiot. But can I be an
idiot now. when I am able to see for mvself
that people look on me as an idiot?
Returning, as a young man, to Russia, he
is thrown into a series of extraordinary
adventures. Through an orgie of passion
centred around a girl of wonderful beauty,
seduced in her youth, the prince moves with,
his calm and calming gaze. This girl prac-
tically sells herself to the highest bidder in
a scene of almost melodramatic interest, in
which the characters are all more or less
drunk and excited to a frenzy of passion.
Half a dozen of these scene's make up the
book. In Russia —at least, in the Russia of
Dostoevsky—any man’s home seems liable
to be invadpd at any moment by a hetero-
geneous crowd of unpleasant persons, many
of them drunk, who stay interminable hours
talking, talking, explaining their souls to
people who listen impatiently, eager
in turn to explain their own souls. And
everyone insults everybody else —and is for-
given. An itch to torment each other seems
part of the mental idiosyncrasy of each!
character.
Jt
Dostoevsky troubles little about his con-
struction. The heroine drops out of the
story for hundreds of pages, and her place
is usurped by another heroine. Several
chapters are given up to the full text of a
dying confession read by a consumptive
youth of 18, eager to make his departure
from ate in a melodramatic way, and finally
to put on record his soul. And the gaps in
the narrative are clumsily filled with long
explanations from the author. Dostoevsky,
for instance, remembers towards the end of
the novel that there are quite a lot off per-
sons mentioned whose souls he has not ex-
plained to the reader. They are “common-
place” or “ordinary” people. And Dostoev-
sky takes pages to show that their ordinari-
ness is really extraordinary. In fact, every
soul —this is his message—is extraordinary.
Yet the women of his story are strangely
interesting, depicted with an almost mali-
cious verity. What happens—and the most
melodramatic incidents happen in the spa re
left for them between the interminable con-
versations —does not matter. The Russian
soul does. The book ends with a horrible
murder of the heroine, and the murderer
takes the poor idiot to show him the victim.
They stay all night in that death chamber,
and in the morning the prince has become
hopelessly insane. For sheer horror this
incident can hardly be matched. But it is
like many other passages, such as the de-
scription of a convict’s feelings when the
guillotine is about to drop on his neck, the
last moments of a man condemned to be
shot —as Dostoevsky was himself condemned
to be shot, the mental experiences of an
epileptic just before having a fit —Dostoev-
sky was an epileptic.
But “God only knows what is hidden in
those weak and drunken hearts.” God —
and Dostoevsky.
Shaw, the Romantic
Is Bernard Shaw his own dupe? Is this
man who prides himself on his freedom from
illusions and on the irresistible power of
pure thought being used as an idle toy by
superior powers at the very moment he is
proving their non-existence? Must we add
Shaw to his dramatis personce ? Is he really
a rabid romantic? These, and other cognate
questions are brilliantly asked and answered
by Dixon Scott in his amusing and quite
Shavian article .upon Shaw in the September
Bookman, History, says Scott, will not
have “that striking picture of the fierce
Irish eremite, staining his sackcloth to make
it look like motley, and using his staff and
scrip, sublimely sacrilegious, as a fool’s blad-
der and wand.” Chesterton has written of
Shaw’s “narrow Puritan home;” and his
photographs, of which this magazine gives
many, picture him as a lean, harsh, unrelent-
ing fanatic ; but, says Scott. “You are being
bluffed by a beard. It obliterates a bland
and luscious chin." Shaw is no puritan: he
is the son of Lucrezia Borgia!
“Of Lucrezia Borgia ; and of the Margaret
of ‘Faust’; and of the Donna Anna of ‘Don
Giovanni.’ For Shaw's mother was a
young and beautiful Irish opera singer (she
was only 20 years her son’s senior), who
-carried on a ‘blameless menage a trois’ with
a famous musical genius and the feckless
second cousin of a baronet (Shaw’s father) ;
and Lucrezia Borgia (Donnizetti’s), Donna
Anna and Margaret were her three favorite
parts.”
J*
It is astonishing, the critic says, how
adroitly these romantic facts have been muf-
fled in all the current accounts of his charac-
ter. “Aceticism and austerity!” Dixon
snorts: “The lad’s life was a voluptuous
revel. He dreamed and dawdled at school.
. . . .but at hopie he simply soaked himself
lusciously in the licensed orgies and
ecstasies of music.” Shaw admits that he
approached literature through music: “I
gained penetrating experiences 0f.... the
Bible from Handel, of Goethe from Schumann
. . . .besides finding in Berlioz an unconscious
interpreter of Edgar Allan Poe I could
become quite maudlin over Mendelssohn and
Gounod.” “Elaborate, these orgies.” Scott
adds, “with emotions greedily sought for in
the Italian rooms of the Dublin Art Gallery
—rooms which he haunted hungrily, weeks
at a time, all through his romantic adoles-
cence” ; and you see how much of ascetism
triers was in his upbringing. Thus, when he
reached London in his twenties, he was a
pure romanticist. And London took him in
hand —this “tender emotionalist, fed hitherto
wholly on the sweetstuff of onera and still
viewing the world in terms of Shelley and
Wagner.” Shaw met Sidney Webb, and re-
cognised him as “the ablest man in Eng-
land.” He determined to be another Sidney
Webb, and went straightway into training.
He, too, would be a dictator, an authority, a
liberator, a dogmatic and precocious oracle.
And in the process “all his soft faculties”
were thrust into a permanent mould: “just
thoSe quaint, innocent qualities of con-
temptuousness and arrogance which ought,
in the ordinary way. to have been softlv
erased by experience,” were emphasised and
petrified and fixed for ever on bis character.
He was quite unfitted for the job : Dixon Scott
records in # Shaw’s own words his struggles
“to learn the tricks of Cockney repartee.”
But the result of this inverted idealism was
the production of “one of the most remark-
able verbal weapons ever forged by a literary
craftsman.”
J*
“It was a cnld-drawn instrument of ex-
pression built for cut-and-thrust conflicts —-
designed to fulfil every platform need or
emergency that its maker’s imagination could
foresee; and every ancillary qualification or
charm was dourly and ruthlessly threshed
out of it. To get rid of these alloys and vet
maintain the thing’s temper meant the in-
vention of a whole new range of prose de-
vices : and it is the way he worked at these,
the devouring adroitness he showed, the fresh
formations and annealings and interlockings
of language he passionately invented and per-
fected, that give us our first infuriating idea
of the triumphs he would have brought us,
the work he might have done, if only he had
never been drugged and trepanned and un-
consciously sola into slavery whilst asleep.
... .The hour of ‘oratory’ was over : the per-
oiation was punctured; the purple passage
was merely a red rag to rouse restiveness;
hungry democrats and terrible vegetarian-
anarchists wanted utterances that hit and
looked like lumps of steel.”
This Shavian prose, Scott asserts, for
rapidity, poignancy, unanimity, promptness,
and an exquisite timing and adjustment of
its parts, cannot he compared with any other
prose in English. “Lightened of all adjec-
tives —nimble with nouns —turning cate-
gories into keyboards when it wants to
ripple us a run, and avoiding vowels in order
to obtain the snap of consonants—it rattles
at a rate that makes the best of Swift seem
slow, and pelts the brain with stinging
drops like driving hail. It is deliberately
cold and colorless, but it produces a kind of
glow—a sensual warmth that almost melts
the icy argument, almost turns it into some-
thing soft and kind.... It grows more sen-
sual the more cynical it'becomes; it prac-
tises a bodily seduction even while seeming
wholly to rely on pure intelligence.”
But his style reacted on himself. Actu-
ally it was his own mind that he put on the
anvil and altered ; “it was his own larynx
that he fitted with patent stops....lie
slaved to acquire a tone of icy arrogance;,
once found, it seemed to freeze to his
tongue.” And, within the bars of this cage
is an artist. But the artist cannot
escape. “He feels forced to adhere to all the
attitudes of his salad-days, down even to
his devotion of salad ; he is incapable of con-
fessing that those early passions for rolled
oats were really only another of youth’s
ways of sowing wild ones. . . .His heart is in
the right place ; it is only his tongue that has
gone wrong ; it has taken a permanent twist
into his cheek.”
Dixon Scott’s delightfully cheeky article
will be chuckled over —most of all by Shaw.

William Morris
“In a multitude of memoirs, it may well
be that all recollection of a man is lost.”
Thus 11. B. Cunniughame Graham, in his
stimulating introduction to Arthur Oomp-
ton-Rickett's biography of William Morris
(Jenkins, 7s. Gd.), “A study in personality,”
the author labels this big, elaborate book.
But Cunninghame Graham has hit off that
personality more aptly in liis seven pages of
introduction. Thus :
“Morris was of the middle height and
very strongly built, not the least athletic- ‘
looking; but still a stout carle for the
nones. His face was ruddy, and his hair
inclined to red, and grew in waves like
water just before it breaks over a fa 11....
When he walked he swayed a little, not like
a sailor sways, but as- a man who lives a
sedentary life toddles a little in his gait....
His speech and his address were fitting to
the man ; bold, bluff and hearty. ‘None of
your damned poets about me !•’ he might
have said —perhaps he did ; I almost fancy
that he did.... When In* talked he seldom
looked long at you. and his hands were
always twisting, as if they wished to be at
w'ork....llis speech was not convincing,
but mofet enthusiastic in its quality. You
felt when hearing it: this man is right,
although you half suspected he was wrong.
That kind of speech befits the kind of man
Morris was. for those who speak in order
to convince most commonly speak to ad-
vance a cause, and not unusually their own
....Morris most certainly wanted nothing
from mankind. His was the nature that has
all to give—his art, his genius, ideas, and
himself....l think he had no humor, for
he loved fun. broad, medieval fun and jokes
....Criticism did not. I fancy, bother him
greatly, and for it he used to substitute
that hearty hatred of forms of art that did
not interest him. a"n attitude which minds,
stronely creative in themselves, are prone
to fall int0....T0 read Morris and never
to have known the. man is to lose half of
him. . ..For me, he was no mystic, but a
sort of symbolist set in a medieval frame,
and it appeared to me that all his love of
the old times of which he wrote was chiefly
of the setting; of tapestries well_ wrought;
of needlework, rich colors of stained glass
falling upon old monuments, and of nna
work not scamned. I cannot find a trace
of medievalism in the inside of his work.
There you have the essential Morns.
Those who need details can find a heap ot
them in the body of the book.

able cartridges are invaluable is
in big-game hunting. A miss-fire,
an inaccurate cartridge, or one
having poor penetration may
mean the loss of a coveted trophy
or even injury to the hunter.
Winchester the W brand —of
big-game cartridges, either smoke-
less or black powder, can always
be relied on to be sure fire, accur-
ate and to have the proper speed
and penetration. You can help

opinion of
CLEMENTS
--TONIC--
Miss Cardwell writes from her private residence, “ Coreeßooth —
Annandale, Sydney:—
CLEMENTS TONIC LTD., :
“I have very great pleasure in testifying to Clements lonic as
builder-up when in a run-down condition.
“When teaching in the State schools of New South Wales I wany
times resorted to its use, taking one to three bottles in course.
“The ever constant strain on the nerves of a Public School
soon brings on a low state of the whole system. In my case it vas ov
strain in teaching and mental worry through family bereavements,
ing Clements Tonic advertised, I tried one small bottle, and feeling m
benefit got the larger size. It was such a restorative that wheneiei
the least run-down, it never failed me. No household should be g
it, or fail to use it in any case of over-strain, for I feel sure it wi
the desired effect. You may publish this letter. „

THIN WOMEN!
What is more pitiable than a pretty woman whose neck, arms and
scraggy chest destroy her every chance of being really charming ?
Nothing gives charm to a woman so much as does a full, well-rounded,
perfectly-developed figure. If you lack it, science will enable you to
obtain it.
WHEN you look into the mirror and your
hollow cheeks, thin neck and scrawny
arms mock even you, what effect do
you suppose they have on those with whom
you mix socially?. .. .A woman’s chief charm
is a well-rounded figure and full bosom. With
these, thin arms and hollow cheeks are a
rarity.
If your bust lacks development, and you
are scraggly and attenuated, we will advise
you free and gladly as to how you may im-
prove your figure and beautify your bust.
We are only too pleased to tell you the
secret, for we know it cannot fail, and that
in a few weeks you will be happier, healthier
and more sought after socially than in your
present undeveloped, emaciated condition.
Thousands of women suffering the ravages
of ill-health have sought and accepted this ad-
vice, and to-day are models of womanly de-
velopment and examples of perfect health.
The same success awaits your call. In the
wake of attenuation follow such complaints
as constipation, indigestion, bilious head-
aches, internal functional derangements, etc.
As your development advances and weight im-
proves, these gradually disappear and perfect
health results.
Every case is accepted under a guarantee
to refund fee if satisfactory results do not
follow the use of the treatment. SEND FOR
SPECIMEN COPY OF GUARANTEE.

Dear Sir,—Words fail to express my
gratitude for what your wonderful
remedy has done for me. Since taking
Flesh-Food my health is much better,
my appetite is keen, I enjoy my meals,
and I can see that they nourish me
properly now. My weight increased
nicely, and my bust has enlarged by
four inches, and has not stopped de-
veloping yet. My hips are now nicely
rounded, and my health is splendid.
Yours faithfully, BOSE WAGNER.

writes: —
"It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I
have been completely cured of the Tobacco Habit by
your wonderful Tobacco Specific, after using tobacco
heavily for seven years, sometimes Boz. to lOoz. in
the week. It is now 12 months since 1 last used
tobacco, and, although I am, continually in the com-
pany of smokers, I do not have the least desire to
smoke, therefore I consider the cure permanent.
“Mv general health is now perfect; all my former
complaints, such as irregular Heart Action, Dizzi-
ness, Nervousness and Stomach Trouble, which I
have every reason to believe were caused through the
use of tobacco, have entirely disappeared, and are
onlv remembered as a hideous nightmare. I eat
and sleep well, and feel fit to face the world again.
Tt will give me great pleasure to recommend your
remedy to others.”

Woodburn Heath.
The Spring has come to Woodburn Heath,
With joyous eyes and honeyed breath,
And scattered broadcast, wealth untold
Of pink and gold.
The purple sarsaparilla, hung
Upon the bracken, she has tiung
In wanton prodigality
And careless glee.
And of her largesse wattle trees
Fling golden bounty to the breeze
That dances, singing as it c-omes
Of scented gums.
Here the boronia blossoms crowd
In radiant host, and as a cloud,
Incarnadine at dawning, glows
The native rose.
The bloodwood capsules, dry and brown,
Make pungent perfume dropping down;
The bottle-brush’s stately head
Is decked with red.
All sweetly flushed is Woodburn Heath,
As a maid’s cheek, where underneath,
The tender brown of wind and sun,
The red veins run.
And shining from her joyous face
Is nought but artless vernal grace—
They lie who say you met your death
On Woodburn Heath!

Sabbath Thoughts.
Upon a sultry Sabbath day
Good people on their way to pray,
Decked out in starchy church array,
Pass by
And eye
Askance my easeful mode of prayer,
As, lost within an easy chair,
A kind tree keeping off the glare,
I pray
This way:
“I thank Thee that Thou didst not please
To make me, Lord, as one of these
Who squander thus their hours of ease,
While they
Might stav
A.nd snooze beneath my shady tree.”
(For ease doth ever make of me
A creature full of charity.)
I sigh
As I
Upon a flower perceive a bee
Work overtime: such industry
Disturbs my sweet tranquillity.
And then
Again
The Army settles somewhere near
And sends unto my suff’ring ear
A host of noises shrill and queer.
I pray
That they
May go. and even while I pray
I henr them pass upon their way
To turn some other sleeper grey
With lays
Of praise.
Ah me ! ’Tis sweet to lie and doze
And listen while the thoughtful hose
Upon the thirsty lawn bestows
A drink.
I think
Of years and years of endless ease
Beneath some kindly, shady trees
Away from silly, busy bees
Where i
Can lie
Within this easy chair and yawn
All day upon a drunken lawn
And wait for more such days to dawn.

Echo of the Bells.
Mv native mountain village, hidden high
above the plain,
Though not again its red-tiled roofs and
belfry I may see,
Still echoes to my memory the clang of a
refrain
Rung out across the valleys like a message
sent to me :
“Home, come you home!
The world is not so sweet
That you, with wearied feet,
Should follow fate, and roam
Afar with vague unrest;
But here with us is best.
Home, come home !’’
I know the western summits are emblazoned
as of old,
Against the violet scarpings that rive the
rugged hill
With sunset capes of splendor and palaces
of gold ;
While, swelling and diminishing, the
chimes are calling still: —
“Home, come you home ! fc...
From all the stress and coil
<)f pleasuring and toil
Where turbid waters foam
Or smoky cities roar —
To ancient peace once more.
Home, come home !”
The grey-walled gabled cottage and the
swinging ropes of vine,
The sloping emerald meadows and the
star-bespangled dells,
The mighty snow-clad ridges streaked with
sombre ranks of pine—
I see them all re-pictured to the echoes of
the bells: —
“Home, come you home!
Life’s book is read full soon —
Dawn swings apace to noon,
And evening shuts the* tome.
What profits it to stray
And fret sweet hours' taway?
Home, come home !’’

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions. ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the liditor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

SOME MORE ABOUT IMMIGRATION.
A member —not by any means the brightest
member —of the present N.S.W. Labor
Government lately broke out in an old place
with a denunciation of immigrants. The
Liberal party, in his opinion, wants to pour
white people into the country in order to
reduce wages. And no doubt some Liberals
—probablv a good many of them —have that
end in view and have a crazy idea that im-
migration into an almost empty country is
calculated to reduce pay immediately and
permanently. The intelligence of fhany
Liberals isn’t of a lofty order. It seems a
pity that a Labor Minister should have such
profound faith in that intelligence as to
assume that, because Liberals expect cer-
tain results from certain causes, these re-
sults are bound to ensue. Labor Ministers
are not paid their salaries to wallow in
admiration of the enemy’s mental capacity.
If the Liberals are prepared, as alleged, to
do the best thing from the worst and most
mistaken motives, it seems advisable to let
them do L, and enjoy their disappointment
afterwards. It is a mighty poor general
who refuses to profit by the enemy’s
blunders. Of course there is no evidence
4bat all Liberals desire immigrants for the
sake of getting cheap labor, but that is
hardly the point. The main issue is that it
is absurd to believe that what Liberalism
favors Labor must always oppose.
Flowers, M.L.C., can’t afford to go naked
because Wade, M.L.A., wears clothes, and
there are many other cases on which direct
and strenuous opposition is undesirable.
Unfortunately on this matter many Labor
politicians are apt to lose the run of their
principles just as they did over their alleged
anti-borrowing policy and other things. The
party isn’t opposed to immigration, but too
many of its members have a habit of forget-
ting the fact.
Australia, to put the matter shortly, is in
desperate need of more good white popula-
tion —not any kind of population ; and when
any politician who is allowed to tack his name
on prominently to a party which should
stand for the highest Australian patriotism
preaches the gospel of emptiness he becomes
a calamity. To take the most rudimentary
aspect of the case, this continent wants de-
fenders —not defenders crowded into one or
two or three big cities in the most sheltered
corner of the continent, but a widely distri-
buted, robust and well-trained people. To
the north of us is a nation equipped for war,
with about one-twentieth our area and ten
times our numbers, and that community is
growing five times as fast as ours. A nation
of the sort is liable to slop over, especially
if it sees within easv reach an empty coun-
try to slop to. Certainly there might be
treaties in the road, but no hundred treaties
ever restrained a warlike crowd, if the slop-
ping-over instinct was upon it. Assuredly
the risks that the assailant took might be
tremendous, but when a splendidly-armed
fighting multitude grows hungry enough to
eat the Trades ITall and the Eight Hours
Procession raw, it takes little stock in risks.
Then Australia apparently wants more tax-
payers. When the richest and most boast-
ful and by no means the least densely-
peopled State of this Commonwealth has
been trying for 50 years and more to raise
the price of a single bridge, and hasn’t
found the money yet, there is surely room
for improvement in its affairs somewhere.
And when the “permanent and reproductive”
loan works of the same State have sunk into
the condition of a dead loss and a burden
on the people, it suggests either most lament-
able management or a grievous lack of folk
to use these works and make them remunera-
tive. As to the want of more citizens to
carry the burden of the Public Debt, any-
body who has tried to lift the hefty incubus
can speak with authority on that point.
And the need for more small capitalists to
lend our thriftless Governments a trifle of
money to go on with clamors to the halls of
Heaven —unless it is claimed that Holman
and McGowen and Scaddan and co. are
selling our children into financial bondage
to the absentee capitalist out of sheer love
of him. For people who clamor so much
against the absentee in general and the
capitalist in particular, the situation is
grotesque.
This Commonwealth, being a remarkably
unpeopled land, with great areas and few
protectors, has, naturally, a big surplus of
food for export. If there were more inhabi-
tants here to use the food locally it would go
to build up the bodies of those who may
one day be badly wanted to prevent an in-
vader eating the Trades Hall and the Eight
Hours Procession. As matters stand the
surplus goes, in a great measure, to feed
people who are likely one day to shoot at
us instead of with us. Probably the first
enemy who is disembowelled in the coming
struggle will have good Australian provi-
sions in his inner economy —the provisions
which we have supplied to help make him a
really capable fighter, and which we have
sent abroad at great, needless cost in freight
and charges to make our own army an in-
capable one. Food makes man, but a land
of many risks should be careful which man
it makes with its food. At the same time,
through lack of artisans to eat the local
food, the Commonwealth is dependent to an
amazing extent on far-off countries for its
manufactured goods. It is dependent to an
extent that now represents nearly £80,000.000
per annum. Australia will be a world’s
curiosity in the day of blockade unless it
gets a hustle on itself with its population
problem. It will have few soldiers. Its
inflow of manufactured goods—boots and
clothes and hats and ironware and a thou-
sand sundries —being cut off, and its outflow
of raw material being stopped, its scant
population will wander more or less nude
and very short of arms, locomotives and
other appliances of war, amid mountains of
unmarketable provisions. The money hav-
ing ceased to come in by way of nayment
for exported provisions, therp will be a
curious breakdown in the machine of civili-
■ sation. In fact, things will be quite mild
and primitive except for the presence of the
enemy. He roav be primitive, but he isn’t
likely to be mild.
Australia, by reason of its lack of people
and the consequent marvellous development
of the importing and exporting disease, is,
for the size of its census, about the largest
employer of cheap labor on this earth. Local
industry can be watched and regulated, but
imported goods can’t —at least, not to any
great extent. They are selected solely on
account of their cheapness. If they stand
for the work of the “scab.” the black man,
the yellow man, the sweater’s serf or the
ghost-female who sings the Dirge of the
Shirt—well, in the free competition of the
importing trade it is so much the more
likely that Australian unionists buy them
and use them. It isn’t a pleasant idea that
this nation should be, for its dimensions, the
boss sweater of the earth, but until the
country acquires sufficient men and women
to make its own goods and bangs the door
on cheap imports with a real, hard bang per
medium of High Protection, it is likely to
remain in that disgraceful condition. It
isn’t proposed, of course, that the Common-
wealth should ambition to be like
England, a place with 620 people to the
square mile, and so helplessly dependent on
foreign lands for its food that it could be
starved out by a few weeks’ blockade. But
to be a place with less than two persons to
the square mile, and so hopelessly dependent
on foreign lands for manufactured goods and
Toans that a few weeks’ blockade might
mean bankruptcy and the breakdown of civi-
lisation would prove very little better in a
day of sudden stress.
The immigration question depends on
another question, or series of questions, to
this effect: Is the whole scheme of Aus-
tralian Labor politics a failure? Is the
decently paid trades-union section in this
country merely a temporary parasite, like
the old slave boss of Louisiana or Arkan-
sas? If Australia can’t make its own goods
on its own premises without reducing wages
—if it can only maintain its most favored
workers at their present level of existence
by buying the cheap products of the foreign
wage slave, and paying for them by export-
ing the products of- the local wage slave who
is the cow-cocky’s child and other ill-paid
or unpaid toilers —then there is a large hole
in the bottom of the situation. If, in addi-
tion, it is necessary to bolster up the situa-
tion by loans from the foreign capitalist,
and by selling the young sons and daughters
of the land into financial bondage to the
Egyptians of the Stock Exchange, then the
position is rotten, and can’t last. _ There is
no real difference in an industrial sense,
however much there may be in a racial
sense, between buying the goods of the nig-
ger or the serf abroad and letting
the nigger or the serf make the goods here.
One is, industrially, as much treason to
unionism and White Australianism as the
other. The Bulletin, however, doesn’t
take the despondent view that this Common-
wealth must be a nigger-driver by deputy
and a slave-owner at second hand in order
to live and be bright and free. It believes
that, given a sufficient influx of good, white
citizens, an efficient tariff and sane finance
it is quite possible for it to supply its own
requirements by the aid of well-paid free
labor. The influx of population to such an
empty country as this doesn’t, except under
utterly insane management, necessarily in-
volve low wages. It may be the other way
about. Away back in 1823, when N.S.W.
had no population to speak of, a laborer’s
pay, for very long hours, was 3s. a day.
Yet in that same year butter varied from
2s. 3d. to 2s. lOd. per lb. ; wheat was Bs. per
bushel; eggs Is. lOd. per dozen ; and mutton
Bd. per lb. All this made a beautiful out-
look for the three-shilling laborer. It was
only with the influx of population that wages
began really to go up. In the very old,
thinly-peopled days remuneration in N.S.W.
wasn’t much better than that of Robinson
Crusoe when there was no rush of immi-
grants to his island.
But even if wages did fall a little when
a large influx of people set in—they
couldn’t fall much under decent tariff con-
ditions unless all the machinery of trades
unionism and wages boards is a hollow
mockery—what exactly is the difference be-
tween a Liberal who wants to grind down
his bootmaker here by competition, and a
Freetrade Laborite who believes in grinding
down his bootmaker abroad by the policy
of buying foreign goods in the cheapest
market? In one case you see the boot-
maker and in the other one you don’t, but
even the least imaginative mind must rea-
lise that there always is a bootmaker. Labor
has three disastrous supporters—the bor-
rower, the spendthrift and the person who
believes in importing almost anything and
everything except reliable white citizens and
defenders. And they are three millstones
round its neck.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Comets, etc.
It is a matter of some interest that five of
the six federated States maintain an astro-
nomical observatorv apiece. Presumably
this is done as a matter of dignity and
pomp, but there is a streak of absurdity
about the dignity, and the pomp costs money.
At one time an observatory 7 was tacked on
to a weather bureau, and a star-research
was done in the intervals of trying to hunt
up rain for the thirsty farmers, but now that
the departments are separated the five star-
gazing jobs have to justify, their own exist-
ence. For years they had a share in the
great undertaking of mapping out the
heavens, but that work is practically fin-
ished now. The occupation that remains
consists partly in ascertaining the exact
hour of noon, and firing a gun, or dropping
a time-ball, or waving a flag, or something
of the sort to relieve the suspense of the
population. Every ship captain is supposed
to be able to find the hour of noon, with
equal accuracy. Something may be done
occasionally in the way of supplying infor-
mation to the press, but only a very few
experts care for that kind of information,
and the experts possess it already. And an
Australian State Astronomer may, or may
not, come back to his office at night and
hunt for comets, and he may have better or
worse luck, or no luck at all, in finding
comets. The public ratlrer likes a comet if
it is a big one with a Persian cat’s tail,
but it takes a very dull interest in the con-
cern which is merely a bag of flying stones
with a faintly luminous decomposition be-
hind, making poor time among the back
rows of the stars. There is no money in
comets, and anyhow:, two first-class
establishments in the northern hemisphere
and two in the southern, aided by private
enthusiasts, could dog all the comets this
world is likely to require. It seems some-
how that Australia is overdoing an abstruse
branch of learning. These remarks are in-
spired by the fact that, recently, five costly
observatories in this country were chasing
one poor little sawn-off heavenly body
which looked like a farthing rushlight a
billion miles away. It suggested turning
five bloodhounds loose after a sparrow.
What chance has a small, lame comet in
these circumstances? If astronomy has
any hope of locating Heaven, then it is
hardly possible to spend too much on it.
Otherwise people are apt to think it a futile
trade for such lavish public endowment,
especially when there is such a struggle to
find money for deepening the entrance to
Port Phillin, and the railway to Port Dar-
win isn’t even started.
The Urgent Need for Importing a
Premier from Brazil.
Tom R. Johnson having been so conspicu-
ous a success as boss of the N. S. Wales
railways, the Government proposes to pass
him out before his engagement expires, in
March next; and that it may be quite sure
of getting another genius trained in the
same school, so that another Government
may pass him out before his term expires it
cabled recently to the Agent-General in t-mg-
land to appoint a Board to choose Tom 1{ s
successor. Probably the Agent-General mav
be able to secure the help of the Board
which recommended Johnson, and if he
has that bit of luck the State’s cup 0 f *
happiness should be full. Not that this
paper has any complaint to make against
the Board. Presumably Johnson was the
best foreign person available; anyway, the
Government, which knew all about his his-
tory, was so well satisfied that, whereas his
predecessor, the Australian Oliver, had
been hobbled and handcuffed, the foreigner
was given autocratic powers. If he subse-
quently turned out to be an autocrat it was
no more than he was told he was expected
to be. That he could be a successful auto-
crat was entirely out of the question. Aus-
tralia is a country with railway problems of
its own, arising mostly out of its own
geography and its own climate; and the
attention of Australian railway men has
been turned to these special problems ever
since they became railway men. But instead
of making use of these men’s knowledge,
the Government told Johnson to go ahead
on his own responsibility; and he went
ahead with such disastrous results that even
now, with a new harvest beginning, some of
last year’s harvest is still lying at country
stations, the bags rotted, the grain vermin-
infested. And now the present fool-Govern-
ment proposes to bring in another Johnson
to face the same problems with the same
inexperience. Heaven knows why it didn’t
bring in a Portuguese instead of appointing
the Australian Harvey to the Supreme
Court bench ; and to people who propose to
introduce a foreign person to govern the
railways there should have been obvious
advantages in importing a Dutch constable
to manage the police, instead of giving the
job to the home-grown Day. Similarly,
and proceeding on the same principle, Hol-
man is right out of place as Premier of
X. S. Wales; he ought to be Premier of
Brazil, or some other country he knows
nothing about. In return, Brazil should, of
course, send us a Premier —some person who
hasn’t got much of a job where he is, and is
prepared to up sticks and take his chance of
making a rise in some other billet. Or if Hol-
man isn’t prepared to go to Brazil, on ac-
count of his superlative modesty, the next
most proper thing is for him to play second-
fiddle in the local Labor band to Tom Mann
or Ben Tillet. These are very prominent
Labor leaders in England, and Labor is
Labor all the world over, just as much as
railways are railways, or more so. That
they have proved their ignorance of Aus-
tralian conditions doesn’t matter. The
magnificent ignorance that is sauce for the
railway goose is surely sauce also for the
Labor gander. If we can’t get a Premier
from Brazil, let Holman do the plain duty
which impels him to send to England for a
Railway Commissioner, and retire to a sub-
ordinate place under an imported Tom
Mann.
The Naval Base.
It is a good thing to have a fleet; but it is
foolish to keep it right in the marine hallway
where blundering merchant shipping may
fall over it at great expense. Some of the
naval moorings in crowded Sydney Harbor
are awkwardly placed, and shipmasters
using Woolloomooloo Bay have lately been
dodging the anchored cruisers Sydney and
Melbourne, which ships sit at the entrance
when they might easily be down in Jervis
Bay. The modern big steamer is a clumsy
brute of a thing, which sprawls and kicks
and requires several acres of sea to turn
round in. If expensive obstacles such as
modern warships are placed round it, it is
liable to fall over and spoil them. Sydney
would be acting kindly by the Australian
taxpayer and the worried captains and pilots
if it encouraged the worships to use Jervis
Bay or any other unoccupied sheet of water
as much as possible. There is hardly enough
room in its own harbor now for its merchant
shipping and ferry boats. And apart from
that, it is the darnedest of darned foolishness
to try to make a great commercial harbor
also a naval base, even if the big. vain,
vaunting city on that harbor thinks its dig-
nity hurt when it is left out. Britain.
France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Russia and
the United States all know better. A naval
base requires in war-time to be a place at
which all commerce can be prohibited—a
place at which any strange ship that at-
tempts to enter may be cheerfully sunk by
the shore batteries. The harmless-looking
tramp steamer that plods in at night may
be a disguised torpedo . craft, or a mine-
layer, or there may be an intention of sink-
ing it in the fairway, and thus bottling up
the fleet, so it should be prohibited. But it
is impossible, even in war-time, to sink every
strange craft that comes wandering into
Sydney or Melbourne, therefore places of
that sort shouldn’t be naval bases. Then a
naval base should be a locality from which
every foreigner or apparent foreigner can be
remorselessly chased away in time of stress,
because he may 7 be an agent of the enemy,
with schemes and appliances for dynamiting
the warships. In fact, it should be a place
where no foreigner has a right to be at any
time. And if the fleet is beaten and has to
retreat under cover of the shore fortifications
at the base, and there put up a sort of
scrap, it should have no terrified city behind
it clamoring for a surrender because the
enemy’s shells are setting its shops and
warehouses on fire, and burning the spring
bonnet, and making hay of the spring pants.
These are a few of the reasons why Sydney
and Melbourne and Adelaide shouldn’t he
naval centres. And there are other reasons.
The Railway Confusion in N.S.W.
Tile same day when it was announced that
Newcastle isn’t able to handle more than
half the coal which now wants to get away
from that congested river mouth, there wa
lamentation at Sydney. It was announce
that in the single item of agricultura
machinery—an article for which the farm
is shouting like a demon with hayseeds 1

nrioritv.
for Sydney they get jammed in the last
stages of their journey and time is lost,
though it must be admitted that what is lost
in time is gained in the shape of chaos. And
when a goods train does escape out of the
welter with its load, it is often an absurdly
long time in coming back for another load,
because under the wonderful one-port system
it has often such an absurdly long way to go.
It might cover the ground faster if it had a
better engine, but the present Government
has managed to turn the once-profitable
lines into a dead loss, and engine repairs
are skimped to prevent the loss becoming
any deader. If it became much deader it
would soon be “high.” The number of rail-
way employees has been more than doubled
in six years, and the amount of railway
takings earned per year by each employee
has consequently dropped from about £3OO
to about £2OO. As rolling stock, coal,
material of all sorts, and interest on bor-
rowed money have to come out of that
amount it is plain that the employee, now
that he has become so amazingly numerous,
can’t expect any further increase of w r ages
unless fares and freights are to be again
raised, or unless bankruptcy is to supervene.
The way things stand he gets the whole
darned lot, and a trifle more, which is about
all there is to get, even though the rotten
old engine is driven off its legs in the
struggle to save money. The Bulletin
never burned much incense at the shrine of
Johnson, nor offered up sheep, goats or
horned cattle as fried sacrifices on his altar,
big it feels rather sorry for him just now.
The effort to make bricks without straw
has become serious. The simplest form of
economy would be to shorten the haul,
wherever possible, by using the nearest good
port for export and import business, but
that, it appears, is the one economy which
no Government will consider. The present
crowd would probably kill Johnson in cold
blood if he mentioned it, and bury his re-
mains under the hearthstone of Parliament
House.
On the Advantages of Light, Drastic
Legislation, etc.
“Xylem” —who is by way of being in the
medical business —has a few words to say
on the advisability of keeping the general
public ignorant about venereal disease :
The more we treat syphilis as a disease of shame
the less victims will it demand of our children. To
say, as The Bulletin does (9/10/’l3) that if it had
been subjected to the same free discussion as has
small-pox, it would have been wiped out long ago
is to utter a thorough-paced absurdity. Free public
discussion on medical science does little or no good,
and may, in this case, work incalculable harm.
Legislation is certainly necessary—not for those who
wilfully run the risk of the sexual scourge—but for
those poor wretches whose fathers and mothers have
branded them with a sorry birth-mark. The congeni-
tal syphilitic should be protected by the State not
allowing him to be born. Proper segregation and a
strong eugenic law prohibiting the marriage of in-
fected individuals would ensure a more healthy sexual
life, and would eliminate the poor human monster
who, before he opens his eyes on the world, is branded
with his parents’ sins.
The above is quoted more as a deplorable
example of the way intelligent folks cling
to ancient and oft-exploded gags than any-
thing else. During the past 250 years, at
least, the world has found repeatedly that
there is nothing more salutary to the com-
munity than what “Xylem” terms “free
public discussion on medical science.” It
was first tried in London during the plague
year of 1665. The Government was panic
stricken. The medical profession was des-
perate. The College of Physicians issued a
Pamphlet explaining what the plague was;
how it was contracted ; what were the like-
liest methods of evading it; and how plague
patients should be dealt with in the earlier
stages of the disease. It has been said, by
those who should know, that this did more to
scotch the visitation than any other human
effort that was put forward in the cause.
Bince then every other epidemic of import-
ance has been assailed on similar lines.
Twenty years ago, when cholera was devas-
tating Hamburg, Genoa and other widely-
separated Continental cities, the local
authorities fell over themselves, in a manner
of speaking, in their furious struggles to get
the populace to discuss publicly, and in other
respects lay themselves out to assimilate
all that medical science had to say about
the horror of the moment. It was the same
when influenza first appeared in a virulent
form in Europe. When the plague came
to Sydney, 13 years ago, free public discus-
sion of the reasons why fleas should be
shunned, and rats treated like enemies, was
among those popular activities which the
State most welcomed. During Sydney’s
present small-pox epidemic public discussion
on the subject has been so stimulated, at the
instance of the health authorities, that it is
safe to say that the average local daily
newspaper reader knows as much about the
fine points of dodging small-pox as he does
of the careers and habits of C. G. Wade
and Holman. More people have been saved
from consumption probably, by that free
public discussion, of the past couple of de-
cades, which has shown the dullest the in-
fluence of mal-nutrition, bad air, etc., on
those with a pre-disposition for the disease,
than there are niggers in Egypt. And so
with diphtheria, typhoid and countless other
complaints. Light is the enemy of disease
in more senses than one. Knowledge is, for
obvious reasons, particularly needful in the
case of venereal diseases. The only objec-
tion that, can possibly be advanced is founded
on a species of bastard morality, which pre-
supposes that innocent persons are to be
lured on to a life of vice by being told, in
sober medical language, some of the hellish
possibilities of indulging in vice. It is
tantamount to arguing that healthy, life-
loving folks are to be tempted to take
prussic acid by being provided with the
spectacle of a dog or other subject suffering
from a dose of this poison. Legislation pro-
viding for the segregation of syphilitic
parents, is as impracticable and inhumane
as a “eugenic law prohibiting the marriage
of infected individuals.” Modern statecraft
has long since dismissed both proposals as
hopelessly visionary. One of the principal
decisions that was come to by the last Inter-
national Medical Congress—a gathering at
which 7000 delegates, from all over the
world, attended—was a resolution calling
upon the Governments of all countries:—
(1) To institute a system of confidential notifica-
tion of the disease to a sanitary authority wherever
such notification does not obtain, and
(2) To make systematic provision for the diagnosis
and treatment of all cases of contagious diseases not
otherwise provided for.
That is the reform which The Bulletin
has for many years advocated in Australia.
With it should go a full understanding on
the part of the public as to the nature and
possibilities of venereal diseases —precisely
the same understanding that the public has
already of the nature and possibilities of
phthisis. Nothing else will ever eliminate, to
borrow this paper’s critic’s phrase, “the poor
human monster who before he opens his eyes
on the world is branded with his parents’
sins.”
♦
The Great Obstructor.
One of the most prominent features of the
Party. Government system is the persistent
way in which it operates to prevent the
doing of nearly all those things which the
electors as a whole wish to have done. Take,
for example, N. S. Wales and the question
of sane finance. Ninety-nine rational citi-
zens out of every hundred are agreed as to
the danger of the Ma State’s present finan-
cial position and the criminal folly of allow-
ing it to be rendered any worse. In the
matter of the advisability of taking a pull
on the borrowing habit the solid Liberal and
the sturdy Laborite see eye to eye. Human
nature is such, however, that individual
votes are to be got by extravagance. Polit-
ical support is always purchasable by means
of bridges, railways, Schools of Art, Tech-
nical Colleges, grants to A., H. and P. Asso-
ciations, jobs on deviations and a thousand
other schemes for the outlaying of the pub-
lic’s money. So whether these things are
needed or not, the country gets them, pro-
vided the constituency that clamors for
them is doubtful in its allegiance to the party
in power. Also the country pays for them,
or at any rate owes for them. The pheno-
menon occurs regularly, irrespective of
whether Laborites or Liberals are running
things. The difference in the matter of out-
lay consists mostly in the fact that the more
desperate the Administration of the moment
happens to be, the more uncertain it is of
its hold on the popular confidence, or in
other words, the less authority it has for
committing the State to the squandering of
vast sums of borrowed cash, the likelier it
is to be recklessly lavish. Picture a big
drapery shop that was managed now by
Protestants, now by Catholics, and in which
each section sought to remain on top by
making absurd concessions out of the firm’s
dividends to all those who were suspected of
the ability to keep the said section where it
was, and some slight idea of the economic
insanity of our Partv Government system
is obtained. And the calamity works out
analogously in almost every other respect.
Sydney, as a case in point, is understood to
be losing about £lOO,OOO per week by its
small-pox visitation. The shops are half
empty half their time ; the theatres are doing
rotten business; the restaurants walk hand
in hand with insolvency. About 50 per cent,
of the city population have submitted volun-
tarily to the mild discomfort of vaccination.
The remaining 50 per cent.—the cranks, the
irresponsibles, the fools and the incurably
stubborn and ignorant half of the community
—have refused to be treated at any price.
So their city continues to be a species of
pariah, and it goes on losing a fortune every
seven days, and the small-pox flourishes as
briskly as it did when it first arrived. A
Compulsory Vaccination Bill would have ob-
viated these and innumerable other dis-
abilities. It has not materialised, and it
probably never will materialise, because the
Government which Was responsible for it
would alienate the cranks and fools above-
mentioned. persons whose feelings in this
matter should no more be considered than
the feelings of embezzlers or pickpockets
should be in regard to their particular
hobbies. Every single authority of any
weight is at one on the point that the whole
community ought to be vaccinated. But
so long as the votes of the reckless and the
unpatriotic have to be angled for, equally
with the other variety of votes, by
the party in power, no reform of the sort i§
possible. Australia’s child army is a result
of the Party system. The Fisher Govern-
ment feared the votes of the adults who
would have been' inconvenienced by com-
pulsory training, as much as the Deakin
Administration did, or as the Cook crowd
does. The Riverina is cut off from its nat-
ural outlet in Victoria because each succes-
sive N. S. Wales Government fears the loss
of State Bight votes if this obvious act of
justice is done. Jervis Bay and Port
Stephens remain in the trade wilderness be-
cause the opening of them up to commerce
may mean tne loss of Sydney and Newcastle
votes to the Party that is responsible.
There is hardly one big move from
tariff reform (which successive Aus-
tralian Governments have jibbed at per-
sistently by reason of the suspicion that the
Freetrade fantasy still lingers here and
there) down to the building of a bridge be-
tween Sydney and the North Shore of Port
Jackson (a step which, it is feared, may
madden the country voter and the ferry
shareholder) that is not blocked by the in-
sane set of rules under which this country
elects to.fight for wealth and comfort. A
pugilist who went into the ring, of his own
accord, with one hand tied behind his back
and the other muffled in a pillow would be
regarded justly as eccentric. What is the
difference between his mental case and that
of a State which tries to wipe out
a small-pox epidemic by providing for the
compulsory vaccination of unborn infants?
Or to come down to first essentials, a State
which patiently endures a governmental
system which is inevitably responsible for
such dementia?
Free Railways.
One of those episodes which make the well-
wishers of a party wonder why some of its
leaders aren’t exported happened lately at
Melbourne, when ex-Federal - Minister
Thomas delivered a lecture on “Free Rail-
ways.” Thomas s idea isn’t, of course, a
new one. Years and years ago this Free
Railway proposal was the solitary inspira-
tion of a certain profoundly wooden-headed
Sydney paper. A time came when the
wooden-headed paper saw the absurdity of
its ways, and dropped the subject, and now
Thomas has assumed the old mantle of pro-
phecy. To put the scheme shortly, all goods
and passengers are to be carried for nothing,
and the loss made good by a tax on land—
private land, of course, for if the State
taxed its own lands it would simply be tax-
ing itself, and it would have to borrow the
money to pay itself its own taxes. The
abolition of railway charges throughout the
Commonwealth would mean the sacrifice of
£20,000,000 of annual revenue, which is
practically all absorbed by annual expenses.
Then there would presently be many
millions of extra expenses to meet,
for when every schoolboy, newspaper
kid, guttersnipe, pushite, criminal, un-
employed or Domain dosser in every city
took a run as far as Adelaide or Oodnadatta
or Bairnsdale or Bourke or Rockhampton,
whenever he had nothing better to do, the
demand for extra trains and for the quadru-
plication of railways would be something
unparalleled. It would probably be a mod-
erate estimate to put the addition to the ex-
penses within a year or two at £10,000,000,
making £30,000,000 in all, with a prospect
of great expansion. All. this, according to
the Free Railway idea, is to be made out of
land values. But the private land values
of the Commonwealth have never been esti-
mated at much above £500,000,000, and
even if they are put at £600,000,000 the
whole rental, at a very liberal 5 per cent, es-
timate, would be only £30,000,000 a year.
And a good part of that goes in rates, taxes,
probate duties and sundries, and a good
deal more would go in cost of collection.
Thus,. even if every square yard of private
land in Australia and Tasmania were con-
fiscated, and all the mortgages upon it can-
celled, and most of the financial institu-
tions, including life assurance offices and
savings banks, were ruined in on» heroic
smash, the Free Railway idea would appar-
ently break down through want of money
inside a month or two. Somehow it doesn’t
seem worth while to blot out the whole
business of the country in order that Weary
Williams may sleep in the Adelaide ex-
press instead of some cheaper and less mov-
able domicile,_ and may by force of numbers
turn the railway refreshment-rooms into
compulsory free-lunch counters. When the
Fisher _ Government presently returns to
nower it should certainly drop Josiah
Thomas, of Broken Hill, and put somebodv
of a less experimental turn of mind in his
place. A man who failed to realise the
rudimentary facts set forth above hardly
knows enough for an important job. No
party can afford to advertise a Free Rail-
way crank, or a Universal Free Lunch en-
thusiast. or a Free Drinks prophet as one
of its leaders. The advertisement does more
harm than good.
The Stale “Strike” Joke.
Dear Bulletin, —Melbourne has just had a
couple of those senseless strikes of which the
public is getting so thoroughly weary. The
first was that of the builders’ laborers, in
which matter the employers appealed against
a recent determination of the Wages Board
and were so far successful that Justice
Hood, the Appeal Judge, altered the Board’s
decisions in some details, and, particularly,
fixed the builders’ laborers’ hours at 48 per
week instead of the 44 previously in force
and still the regular rule in other depart-
ments of the industry. Before this decision
could be given force by gazettal the em-
ployees “struck,” and, there being no means
of enforcing the decision, and, the State
being thus threatened with an industrial
upheaval, Labor Minister Peacock argued
long and earnestly with the employees—
though without consulting the employers—
and finally suspended the gazettal of the
Appeal Court’s finding for six months. At
which the employers are much aggrieved.
The second ruction concerned the slaughter-
men in the export meat trade, who at pres-
ent have a plaint before the Federal Arbi-
tration Court, and are, further, working
under a private agreement to slay lambs
and sheep at 275. 6d. per 100. The idea
seized these persons, numbering less than
150, that they should be paid 30s. per 100,
and they incontinently demanded it. The
employers refused, cancelled many of their
contracts and prepared to shut down their
works. The men’s leaders and union repre-
sentatives told them plainly they were defy-
ing the law, making a fool of the Arbitration
Court and acting the revolving goat generally ;
but they continued in their contumacy. Then
the Arbitration Court was notified, and Jus-
tice Higgins summoned a conference, and
told the slaughtermen straightly that if they
didn’t return to work there would be a prac-
tical end of the business, as he would arbi-
trate no more. They decided, by 98 votes to
33, to do the right and decent thing, but the
voting showed that one out of every four of
these men is a dishonest and unreliable
waster; and, under existing circumstances,
he may behave again, after the manner of his
kind, with immunity from punishment. The
obvious remedy lies in the one step just short
of which the Federal Arbitration law stops
and at which the State Industrial legislation
shies —namely, compulsory unionism. Were
all these strikers, and other employees,
compelled to join unions—for the mainten-
ance of their rights and the defence of their
obligations—they would not only be less sus-
ceptible to exploitation, better paid and bet-
ter treated, but they would also be rendered
better citizens, inasmuch as they would gain
a larger and wider sense of responsibility
as part of the existing industrial system.
Matters could then be so fixed that persons
who broke their agreements and wilfully and
out of pure impatience or devilment defied
the law, could be made to suffer heavily,
while those who now suffer innocently?
thereby should not be inconvenienced or in-
jured quite so seriously. A certain:
type of worker needs badly to have it im-
pressed on him that the “strike,” regarded!
as an irresponsible joke, has gone very stale..
The greatest sufferers thereby often have'
least say in the matter, and they have grown
weary of the witticism. —Yours, etc., F. C-
About Hungry and Overloaded Ships.
“Shipmate” : A specially appointed com-
mittee of the British Board of Trade is sit-
ting on the loadline, and sliipmen all over
the world are anxiously waiting the result.
For the benefit of the landlubber I’ll men-
tion that the loadline is the line marked on
a ship’s side to show the point to which the
law allows the hull to be submerged. The
little circle (“Plimsoll Mark”) was put
there after Samuel Plimsoll had raised
Cain and a rough sea about the overloading
of ships and sending them out to drown,
while the owners collected the insurance
money, and the widows took in washing. In
1906 Lloyd George, who was a lawyer, or a
bricklayer, or something equally nautical,
agreed to raise this loadline, without appar-
ently consulting anyone who knew anything
about it, except the ones who asked him to
do it. Naturally the shipowners were glad
to have the line raised, as it allowed them
to carry more cargo per ship. Lloyd
George has never been credited with being
anxious to put himself out to please the
wealthy classes, but his complaisance in this
case is accounted for, by seamen at any
rate, thusways. He was being worried by
the Labor demand fqr an improvement in
seamen’s conditions. He was on the Board
of Trade then, and when a committee came
to him and asked him to kindly sign the
altered loadline rule, he saw a brilliant
chance, to strike a bargain and earn loud
cheers from Labor. He told the shipowners
that if they would not raise any fuss over a
new food scale for seamen he would quietly
pass the new loadline. The owners exam-
ined Lload George’s new scale. The old 1
scale was so impossibly bad that, in their-
own interests, most owners had abandoned!
it long before, and the one submitted to them
as the proposed law was little more costly
than the one in general use. In fact, in
many cases it gave the seaman less, as the
present rations are better than Lload
George’s, and a skipper holds it up as a
threat to his crew that he’ll put them on
their “Board of Trade whack.” The owners,
of course, consented to the dicker, and the
new Lloydline quietly became law while
Lloud George called attention to the tre-
mendous improvement he hadn’t made in
seamen’s rations. The landlubber public
thought this a real scoop for the shellback ;
but seamen knew better, and saw plainly
how they had been diddled. Ever since then
a steady agitation has been going on for the
reconsideration of the loadline, and at last
it has resulted in the appointment of the
present committee. There is no representa-
tive of the masters, mates, or men on it; but
it is announced that the committee will
accept in confidence the evidence any officer
or seaman likes to send in. So officers and
men who have anything worth while to say
on the subject should immediately hand out
the yarn to their Service Guild or Union.
Amid all the rush of imported experts to.
Australia there is still no news about the
importation of a mono-rail man. It is now
alleged that Brennan’s mono-rail device
has been so vastly improved that a train
could be run from Sydney to Parramatta on
a single rail in about a dozen minutes,
dropping a car-load of passengers and pick-
ing up a car-load of passengers at each
station without stopping. The matter might
be worth looking into. Brennan, how-
ever, has the bad luck to be an Australian —
by adoption at least. When Australian
Premiers went to England they never
called at his factory—presumably be-
cause a mere Australian, even by adoption,
wasn’t worth considering. Then apparently,

a time came when they were so ashamed of
having ignored the great inventor that they
had to keep ignoring him in order to main-
tain their dignity. Still, when the country
is fuli of foreign wireless experts, and im-
ported Cockburn Sound experts, and extra-
neous Port Phillip experts, and Yankee
experts who come to lay out the Federal city,
and English experts who come to advise on
Sydney’s city railway, it seems a pity that
the mono-rail expert didn’t get so much as a
look in.
The Daylight Saving Bill, fathered by A.
II. Outtkim, of the Victorian Assembly, is
to be discussed in a Federal spirit at the
next conference of State Governmental
heads. If it is good for one State it is worth
adopting by the others. The idea is to put
the G.P.O. and railway clocks an hour —or
75 minutes —forward on a certain date in
spring, and put them as much back on a
corresponding date in autumn. Thus seven
o’clock a.m. would be changed to six o’clock
as soon as it became a time when all good
health seekers would be better out of bed.
The working day would begin earlier, and
the hours after business would contain more
daylight than at present. When the sun-
light period gets greatly contracted at both
ends of the day and there is no more sense
in the “early to bed, early to rise” arrange-
ment, the clocks are put back to the winter
time-table to which humanity is now subject
all the year found. The Victorian Railway
Department favors Outtrim’s proposal;
citv workers of all descriptions are bound
to approve ; shopkeepers and showmen can
have nothing to say against it. The only
perceptible objection to starting the longer
days of the year an hour or so earlier than
the shorter ditto might be raised on behalf
of the placid cow and the canoodling couple.
The cow may not wish to be squeezed earlier
than at present in order to meet the milk-
train requirements of an early rising town,
and it is certain that Love in shady groves
and public parks wants a 11 the dark it can

hand, the Wowser will welcome the Day-

“Leo Lear”: Mount Gambier (S.A.)
perches alongside one of the potholes from
which, in ancient times, the Devil smothered
the surroundings with brimstone, ashes,
heat, dust and sudden death; and every now
and then the residents are reminded, by an
earthquake shock, or a mysterious rise or
fall in the waters of the three lakes that
fill the local craters, that things are probably
not as serene in the basement as they are
on the roof-garden. At present the usually-
stationary waters of the laaes are out on
one of their rampages; and during the past
few weeks they have subsided to such an
extent, in one crater, that people can walk
dryshod over what is commonly a dark, wet
abyss. In the larger and more famous
Blue Lake, whence the town water supply
is drawn, the face of the moisture has
dropped about 18 inches without apparent
rhyme or reason. There is no surface flow
into these lakes, and where the liquid comes
from is a mystery. The orthodox assert
that it is the residue of Noah’s flood; the
mere scientist says it is an underflow from
the waters that run away underground in
N. S. Whies and North Vic. in wet seasons,
and pass out to sea somewhere off the coast.
As some miles from land, off Cape Bridge-
water (Vic.), fresh water can be got in the
ocean, this theory sounds plausible. Then,
this being a dry season in the North, the
surplus underflow would naturally slacken
and tend to lower the Mount Gambier lakes.
Anyway, local residents feel most comfort-
able when they accept this theory; they
don’t like to think of still-active volcanoes,
or picture an emblematical pitchfork poking
through the bedroom floor at the hour of
Nothing a.m.
In N.S.W. the Water Waggon begins to
hustle furiously in view of the general Sta*o
election, and the accompanying local option
roll. For a Sydney Town Hall meeting
held the other day,, the Waggon
issued a card decorated with a big
bottle and a little one, and the
superscription: “This is why the
Brewing Monopoly fights No
license; they know it is effective
in Maoriland.” Well, the big
brewing cos- of Australia never
were so prosperous and never before
riaid such fat dividends as in the
past 12 months, Brisbane offering
the one possible exception to this
rule. And practically the whole
explanation lies in the fact that,
notwithstanding the great increase
in throats that call for irrigation,
there has been no increase in
breweries, the fury of the Water
Waggon having scared investors
off new beer-factory enterprises,
and actually produced an amalgamation here
and there. So if there is a brewing mono-
poly, the Water Waegon is the father of it,
even though it be the bad offspring which
the Waggon seems to infer.

On the third evening of “The Ring,” by
the Quinlan Opera Co. at Her Majesty’s
(Sydney), Siegfried, the hero, son of
Siegmund and Sieglinde, takes the
centre of the stage and gives his name
to this explosion of the colossal music-drama.
Siegfried is the show boy of “the Ring.”
He has the magnificent lung power of a
village blacksmith, and the bright-pink tights
of a star circus rider. Francis Costa, a
robust, not to say stormy, tenor, sang the
music of Siegfried’s persistent warble —
notably the uproarious Song of the Sword
—remarkably well. No slim or drawing-
room tenor could touch this part. Costa, in
spite of a pale tow-colored wig, the violent
pink tights already mentioned, and a tunic
of shining armor, looks like a heavyweight
champion boxer. Therefore, lie is the man
for the part. No Wagnerian orchestra can
or ought to care a tinker’s burial whether
it exterminates the tenor or leaves the
soprano in a dead faint on the doormat of
Valhalla. Its business is to down the singers.
A tenor who can forge a sword, pull the
rope of a primeval smithy’s bellows, stoke a
fire and hammer the anvil like a navvy
cracking blue metal, while he sings Wag-
nerian music (mostly a classic dissonance
arranged against the full blast of the or-
chestra) deserves and got the ovation of
“The Ring” production. As a hero it is
Siegfried’s business to slay Fafner, the giant
who has taken the form of a dragon on
guard over the family plate. This was
originally stolen from the Rhine maidens.
The curse-motif (orchestra) precedes the
deep bass remarks of Charles Magrath from
the dragon’s stomach. In spite of notices
that gentlemen must expectorate in the gut-
ters of this would-be-clean city, Fafner spits
in the face of the hero. No hero would
stand this insult. Fafner dies repentant
after Siegfried has made one lunge at him.
Mime, the cunning dwarf, is also slain
the . forest-life motif and the forest-bird
motif give the orchestra one of its finest
opportunities. Eckhold led his forces
through this sweet ripole of bird-melody with
his whiskers set to pianissimo. Wotan. as
the Wanderer (Parker), heavily disguised
as the first Quaker, and Alberich (in a nasty
temper), with Erda (Edna Thornton) and
the wood-bird, are subsidiary to Siegfried.
Perceval Allen, the Brunnhilde of “the
Ring,” only gets a look-in at the finish.
* * * *
“The Twilight of the Gods,” the grand
terminus or Central Railway station of
“The Ring,” is—musically—the finest of the
Cycle. It chases the curse of the Nibelung
to the end. and the end of things in that old
land of legends was either the perpetual joy
“SIEGFRIED ,” AT HER MAJESTYS ,
SYDHEY
The tuneful dragon Father protests against
Siegfried stealing the magic ring from him.
and drink and battle and free lunch of Val-
halla, or the frost of Niflheim. The open-
ing scene is like the opening in a tunnel.
But the audience, having by this time ac-
quired a Wagnerian trick of seeing the gods
through the middle of the night is used
to tunnels. It discerns—chiefly by the light
of its mind’s eye —the three Norns or Fates
winding and unwinding the rope of destiny.
This appears to be a stout clothes-
line. The Norns are dark and dreary
ladies, and their departure, presumably
through a trap door, is the first cheerful in-
cident of the dull prelude. Then Brunn-
hilde and Siegfried appear, and business
begins to brighten. Hero Siegfried, at the
close of the preceding slab of “The Ring,”
married Brunnhilde. This young matron is,
so far as one can follow the domestic habits
of a valkyrie, her husband’s step-aunt.
Having given his legal lady the Ring, the
hero goes forth to see what he can kill to
the accompaniment of the horn. This gives
the orchestra a joyous interlude, and con-
ductor Eckhold is fiercely crescendo till the
music of the horn is drowned in the waters
of the Rhine. Perceval Allen as Brdnn-
hilde has a tremendous night out in the
“Ring” terminus. Her vocal work in this
great climax is gigantic. She fairly earns
a week’s holiday (all expenses paid by the
management) among the mountains of Gos-
ford, which may or may not be unlike Val-
halla as it really was, if it ever was, which
it probably wasn’t. Wagner mercifully
allows Brunnhilde to drown herself.
Parker, as Hagen, of the Gibichung
race, was tame. His stage sister
Gutrune (Gladys Anerum) wailed sweetly
over the muscular corpse of Siegfried, whose
death marks the last ,lap or heat of the
cycle. Siegfried’s matrimonial troubles with
Brunnhilde, whom he deserts for the golden-
haired charmer Gutrune, lead to his murder
by Hagen, who looks like the animal that
did the slayings in the Rue Morgue. The
Rhine maidens splash round to soprano and
alto music, and get the Treasure back into
their slippery keeping. And Valhalla, in the
absence of a fire brigade, burns to the final
crash of the orchestra, and all the glory and
the free lunch are consumed.

The Quinlan Opera Co.’s production of
“Faust” was chiefly remarkable for the
small dimensions of Marguerite’s (Felice
Lyne’s) waist, and the charm of the or-
chestral performance. The overture or
prelude, under Eckhold’s baton, set the pace.
With the exception of a bumpy moment
with the stage band (soldiers’ chorus scene),
“TWILIGHT OF THE GODS.”
The magic ring on the deceased Siegfried's finger
retuses to be stolen by Robert Parker-
the chorus singing and orchestration were the
events of the evening—after the waist
already mentioned. The young and slender
Felice Lyne (a mere child, as prima donnas
go) sang the showy music of her part in a
voice of limpid purity. It is the voice of a
youthful thrush, with a trill at the top end
and a soft, velvety mezzo at the lower ex-
tremity. As Marguerite, however, Felice is
a mile or two below the Melba performance,
because she is too girlish to grip the right
interpretation. Maurice D’Oisly is a pale,
drab Faust —good in spots, and piebald the
rest of the time. William Anderson gave
us a Sunday edition of the Devil. His
Mephisto was a solid and rather gloomy
Satan, possessed of a fine bass voice and
inarticulate phrasing. Mabel Dennis is pos-
sibly the best Siebel —vocally by reason of
her perfect enunciation —Sydney has encored
for years. Samuell was not up to his true
form in the part of Valentine. Something
went wrong with his breathing apparatus in
the solo, “Even Bravest Hearts,” etc., and
his voice was produced with the wheeze of
Mime’s bellows in that unwashed dwarf’s
primeval smithy. The fall of the Gods
seemed to be progressing favorably behind
the scenes during the “Faust” production.
The noise of heavy bodies rolling over the
performance was, of course, unrehearsed.
Mozart’s contribution to the week’s
opera was “The Marriage of Figaro,” an
opera more comic than grand; with much

whether a better “Bohbme” lias ever been
heard in Sydney. And at odd times, when

called Hoffman’s. The N.S.W. State brick
yards use a different kiln, but they are very
good bricks and you can buy them at Hip
yards for 30s. per 1000. Bricks don’t seem
to have much connection with Quinlan; still
you can drop anything into either grand-
opera or grand-opera criticism. Besides
they’ll come in handy to throw at the press
agent when he calls round to complain that
since there are only 17 adjectives in the

and hostile notice.
Cook and Rotherts are responsible for a
very passable mixture of dancing and con-
tortion at Sydney Tivoli this week, and add
a few vood yarns by way of seasoning.
Theirs is the only new turn. Among the
older hands the most prominent are the
Mullers, hoop spinners : Prince, ragtime vio-
linist; Bellora ; Martynne. the dancer; and
Gene Greene, the champion long-distance
ragtimer.
The kiddies are still doing their charming
little wmgandance. “Eyr-' Irish Blue." at
the Palace (Svdney). Incidentals are Allen
Doone (his singinsr) and Edna Keely (her
accent). Good business induces another
week of the piece.
Jansen, the illusionist, who
started a season at Sydney Royal
on Saturday night, provides a fine
entertainment for the young and
for the earnest or worrying type of
adult who wants to see how it is
done. The people who enjoy it
most are the investigators who
accept the performer’s challenge to
go up on the stage and focus their
vast intellects and eagle eyes on
the box, or bag. or whatever he
happens to be using. The happiest
and proudest man is the one who
is given the pencil and requested
to write his name on the mysteri-
ous prop. He swells up with im-
portance and joy, and when, later
on, he is asked to identify his
own signature, he looks at the tri-
umphant performer with a faithful,
pathetic smile, and shuffles back, very red in
(he face, to his dark and ob?cur° seat. On
the night The Bulletin attended, one of
the earnest investigators was a tremendously
keen young man, and. when the trick bent
him, he came back over the footlights nod-
ding very wisely, with his eyes half-closed
and his lips pursed up. It was a fine ex-
pression implying that he wouldn’t give the
show away.
St. John Ilankin seems to have started
“The Cassilis Engagement” by imitating
Wilde, and then branched off into sentimen-
tal comedy of his own. Adelaide Literary
Theatre gave it a trial showing last week,
and it proved light and bright enough for
any “commercial” theatre. Young Cassilis
has shocked the County by getting engaged.
The girl is unknown ; also her name is Bor-
ridge, so the worst is feared. Mrs.
•Cassilis plans to break off the match
without estranging her son. She will
ask his Ethel for a long country
visit, and let him see how out of it she is in
County circles. The place is 12 miles from
a shop, and 50 from restauiant and theatre.
There is nothing to do but ride —seemingly
the play was written just before motoring
came in—and Ethel, by the whim of her
creator, hates horses. She yawns for a week,
and then, being judiciously reminded by a
rowdy uncle of the delights of town, breaks
off the engagement herself. This slight story
runs to four acts, mostly filled by women.
The acting varied, with only slight excep-
tions, from good to very good. Very sound
in the “straight” parts were Arthur Smith,
Jean Robertson as his mother (though she
made no attempt to look the requisite age),
and Zoe Reid as an Ethel more refined than
the author probably intended. Ethelwyn
Robin scored continuously as Ethel’s impos-

The Russian dancers of the Rickard-
Mclntosh circuit have now srot as fsr as
Adelaide Tivoli, where their act does not
much infringe the copyright of the Saxones
who are in the same line of business. Other
features are the acrobatic Alginas and
Merian’s dogs. The King’s is strong in ani-
mal turns. Mikko (out of another show
now disbanded) is back in Adelaide as the
dog who does mind-reading, and the Morris
ponies knock their trainer about in a wrest-
ling-match. Von Liston also imitates many
animals not otherwise on the programme
La France has added an imitation-of-artists
turn to her artistic posing. The Royal is
closing the Anderson season with “A Day
at the Races” and “The Speculators.” A
leading idea of the latter seems to be that a
Jew has no chance with a Yankee. Some
day a drama will be written on the insol-
vency of the only Hebrew who ever set up in
business at Aberdeen; but that, of course,
will be a tragedy. Incidentally, there was
once an insolvent Hebrew money-lender at
Dunedin (M.L.), and he couldn’t get his
certificate owing to the opposition of a
Presbyterian parson- The Dandies have
started their open-air summer session in
appropriate weather and to enormous book-
ing. Pav. and Wondergraph show pic-
tures all day, and the latter at
night also. West’s have a winner in
the Pompeii film, which is the more striking
because of the sporting way in which old
\ esuvius plays up to supply a background.

In “A Marriage of Convenience,” now
putting in a fortnight’s run at Melbourne
Royal, the comedy gets its most pleasing
effects from its ornate appointments. The
clothes are more admirable than the char-
acters they cover. Comte and Comtesse,
who get married to one another, with the
idea of remaining otherwise engaged, are
picturesque exponents of airs and graces
rather than honest flesh-and-blood creations.
The story of liow the pleasantly improper
husband wins his bride from the chevalier
she had regarded as her sweetheart, whilst
himself dropping the invisible Comtesse
whom lie had accepted as an encumbrance,
is robbed of interest by the Chevalier’s ab-
surd manner of making love to the bride.
Ilis discomfiture is a foregone conclusion,
lie makes himself ridiculous. There is no
apparent need for the Comte to take active
measures to achieve a pretty ending to the
pbwdered and perfumed fiction. After tak-
ing stock of his foolish rival, he might have
written his lawful donah a note, signed
“Yours obediently to command,” and stayed
away until she sent for him. Nobody be-
haves humanly in “A Marriage of Conveni-
ence”-—not even the highly moral uncle, who
rushes off to arrange a divorce for his young
relatives when he should have perceived the
inevitable with one wink of his eye. As a
merely theatrical entertainment the little
comedy is a success, all the same. Lewis
Waller plays the alleged Parisian exquisite
of the period (Anno Domini 1750) with
decorative art and easy confidence. He
cannot make the character convincing
below the surface, but he thinly veneers it
with realism. Miss Madge Titheradge does
as much with the elegantly costumed char-
acter of the Comtesse, who acts remarkably
like the Nellie Stewart of long ago. R.
Dane is satisfactory in the unthankful part
of the chevalier, and Halliwell Hobbes pre-
sents the meddling uncle as a very likeable
old autocrat.
The monologue, written by Henry Hamil-
ton. that precedes the play, is simply melo-
dramatic in design and mechanical in per-
formance. Waller —a wealthy bachelor,
seemingly—walks into the sitting-room of
his flat and speaks of his impending suicide.
Then lie goes through a thin pretence of
admitting King Death, and, the imaginary
presence being seated at his table, Waller
proceeds to read letters from his Girl to the
spectre who isn’t there. He sends no thrill
of horror through the audience. When
he takes his deadly capsule there
comes a letter from his girl announcing that
she will not marry the other fellow, and
when his tongue has ceased from talking
and his body is at rest upon the floor, a
belated spot of tragedy falls upon the scene.
Some knocks at the door are understood to
be indications that the corpse’s fickle girl
has come to be hugged. Unfortunately, no-
body suspects the girl of having existed;
therefore nobody supposes that the actor has
missed anything.
** * *
A revival of “The Arcadians,” at Her
Majesty’s (Melbourne) comes appropriately
at Cup-time on account of the extraordinary
turf episode in the second act. The rules of
racing are outraged by Simnlicitas when he
talks horse to Peter Dood.v’s relinquished
mount and rides the savage beast to victory
in bare legs under catch-weight conditions.
Rut the lack of stipendiary stewards at Ask-
wood is in accordance with the spirit of the
show. “The Arcadians” is half a fairy tale
and wholly different from all other musical
comedies. It was a charming novelty when
Clarke and Meynell produced it in the dear
old days of healthy competition. The revival
by the Combine is less novel and not quite so
charming, but The Bulletin accepts it
thankfully, and in the full expectation that
the nut with a tooth-mark on its shell will
figure in the Arcadian Restaurant menu for
weeks to come.
“WHAT DID TOMKINS
DO?” AT MELBOURNE
BIJOU.
Harry Corson, Clarke —
a study in feel.
Dr. Hastings.
The present cast, with (say) three indivi-
dual exceptions, is somewhat rougher than
the original cast. W. S. Percy, as a cherubic
Simplicitas ; Miss Ghiloni, as the stout lady
who weeps for her guilty passion ; and Doro-
thy Brunton, the dainty Chrysea—these are
the exceptions. For the rest, it must be
admitted that Roberts and Miss Arundale,
the Irish girl and her love-struck Jack, are
never in the picture; that Phil Smith is mis-
fitted to the part of Bobby ; and that Miss
Hilda Vining puts nothing of note save her
fairly good singing into the poetic character
of Sombra. And there are others whose
work wants polishing. Maggie Dickinson
and Charles_ Albert lose no time with the
“flying-angel” item in the second act, where-
as R. Whyte, jun., takes his popular
“Motter” turn rather too slowly.

Joe Fanton’s Athletes, a trio of rapid
gymnasts and strong men, are the latest sen-
sation at Melbourne Opera House,' where also
Miss Whitaker, the lady with a rich con-
tralto voice, is again requesting the congre-
gation to stand up and sing Hal-le-lu-jah.
Reynolds and Nellie Donegan are dancing
divinely on roller skates, and the rest of last
weeks’ programme— minus the Dogs—is pro-
ceeding as before.

To-night (Thursday) and on Saturday the
warble of John McCormack will be heard at
the Melbourne Auditorium. Perhaps McCor-
mack is not the world’s greatest lyric tenor
(although the Taits’ advt. says he
is), but his popularity is large enough
to fill the Auditorium, and his wor-
shippers have never heard enough of him.
To anyone who attaches no special imnort-
ance to Kathleen Mavourneen on account of
the land of her birth, nor is prepared to
swear whether machushla and machree are
terms of endearment or epithets of derision —
to people of that sort the sweet McCormack
voice sounds better suited to an aria from
an Italian opera than to a ballad. It must
be the singer’s quiet, forceful way wid him
which carries his machreetian ditties into
double encores.

At Melbourne King’s they are making
ready for the Musical Burlesque Co., due on
Saturday, in “A Day at the Races.” After
six weeks of “The Confession” the patrons
of Billiam Anderson reckon that this strik-
ingly complete change of bill was fairly up
to him.

The Rev. Cyril Mackay, on point duty at
the corner of the Road to Ruin and the
Path of Righteousness, has had some busy
evenings directing traffic into the latter
thoroughfare, and, incidentally, into Mel-
bourne Princess’s. One of the first pedes-
trians he put straight was Jess Walton, a
lady of peculdtive disposition, who was tak-
ing the wrong turning with a somewhat
dissolute gent. Neither, however, would
yield to Cyril’s forceful persuasion at first.
They continued on the Down Track, leaving
a wake of tobacco smoke and an aroma of
patchouli. The parson spotted them often
after that, and was a saddened spectator
when the lady separated a baronet from a
box of jewellery, and was sent to quod to
ruminate over her impenitence. Later,
when she was at liberty to be cuddled and
kept by a tame journalist, the Rev. Mackay
was still there, pointing a peremptory fore-
finger to the Boulevard de Virtue. On this
occasion Jess accepted the Reverend’s ad-
vice, and grabbed her partner for the Higher
Life, what time the parson was struggling
with another female who had followed Jess’s
former trail with a tremendous appearance
of unsuccess. This wayfarer had previously
stumbled on maternity in her careless way,
and had charged the holy man with the blot
on her escutcheon; but he freely forgave
her, with doffed hat and upraised eyes, when
she came to die of sorrow at his feet. What
with this female and Jess, a 'foolish old
bishop and the villainous author of all the
trouble, the Rev. C. Mackay has led the
strenuous life. Miss Pergusson is the
heroine, Frank Neil a pressman with a foggy
voice, while Hilliard Vox’s idea of the vil-
lain looks like an attempt to present a cari-
cature as an etching. Herbert Leigh,
Arthur Shirley and a couple of others don’t
call for anything large and injurious.
*
The story of Tomkins and what he Did
seems in a fair way to create the want it
came to fill at Melbourne Bijou. Corson
Clarke will keep Tomkins worrying along
through Cup week, and if the guffaw of in-
nocent merriment continues to gain force
his next change of bill may be delayed until
the dust of the Horse Carnival has vanished
into space.

Wirths’ Circus is back again at Mel-
bourne Hippodrome for two weeks. A couple
of small pigs and a flock of Spanish sheep
(including a ram of loose morals) have
been added to the Circus gaieties since its
previous visit, but in other respects it is
much the same collection of feats in the
arena and animals on the-stage. And, as
before, the brightest incident of an estim-
able Wirthian show is La Belle Victoria on
the swinging wire. Her act is wonderful
and her personal appearance gives the boys
a treat.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Stargazer”: Lewis Waller’s Henry V. is a well-
schooled performance. Waller has learnt his part
well, and much practice has resulted in what per-
fection is possible to a good actor who lacks nothing
but temperament. This quality is certainly wanting
in Waller. There is not enough color in the pic-
ture ; it is only an excellent monotone. This being
so, “Henry V.” falls considerably short of an
artistic success. If Henry fails, the slump of the
whole show must be emphatic, since the Shaks-
pearian effort is not a drama at all. As revised and
renovated it is a series of tableaux, with one large
actor exhibiting ironmongery in the spaces between,
and delaying wars and the progress of other great
events while he parades his samples of elocution for
the young.
The proverbial harmlessness of circus lions at
large was further evidenced in Leipzig (Germany).
Eight of the amazed beasts escaped from a cage
which had been wrecked by a tram-car, and, instead
of attacking the shrieking populace, they went around
trying to avoid observation. Three of them did
succeed in making themselves scarce for the time
being, but the other five were shot by the police
without being permitted to plead for mercy. One
lion, says the cable, ran into an hotel; but, instead
of roaring to the bar, thirsting for human blood,
he merely dropped his tail between his legs and fled
upstairs—with a view to shutting himself up in a
bathroom probably.
“0.K.”: Lewis Waller’s production of “A Mar-
riage of Convenience,” at Melbourne Royal, brings
memories of 15 years ago, when Charles Cartwright
staged the ornate comedy at the Bijou, under the
management of Harry Rickards. Cartwright brought
a good company with him, but his leading lady,
Beatrice Lamb, was too large and plump for the
part of the young girl-heroine in “A Marriage of
Convenience.” Cartwright’s daughter, Edith Morley,
a very pretty girl, whose acting was gracefully ama-
teurish, figured as the Comtesse (now played bv
Madge Titheradge). It was during the run of this
piece that Edith Morley met with a shocking mis-
hap. She went out riding with Noni Rickards, and,
being even less experienced on horseback than on
the stage, she got a bad fall, and was dragged some
distance along the highroad, with one foot in the
stirrup. Her pretty face suffered considerably in
the accident. A constant reminder of the members
of Cartwright’s co. is a framed collection of their photo-
graphs in the vestibule of Melbourne Opera House.
Charles Thursby was the jeune premier: he took the
part that Waller plays in “A Marriage.” Hartley
Manners, Dennis Bryan and James Welsh were in
the cast; also Arthur Styan, the only one of the
newcomers who remained in Australia. Gethyn
Darragh and Katherine Stewart were other ladies
of the co. All of these, bar Styan, did their best
work, perhaps, in R. C. Carton’s five-act play, “The
Tree of Knowledge.” Stvan made his particular
success as Lord Jura in “Moths” —he was the high-
toned gentleman of the piece.
“Harrison O.”: What a painfully limited person is
the average grand-opera artist! Let him be able to
sing, and he thinks no more should be required of
him. We may have a Faust looking like an animated
quarter-cask, wooing a Marguerite who is a hay-rick,
and neither of them may be able to act for nuts,
and will not deign to sing so that their remarks may
be understood, yet their possession of voices will be
regarded as compensation for these and other blem-
ishes. Generally speaking, all of these faults could be
overcome, or greatly mitigated; but since musical
critics and the public seem prepared to overlook them,
the performers do not bother. The principals of the
Quinlan company are, in these respects, not nearly so
bad as manv previous visitors, yet in a light opera
like “The Marriage of Figaro,” in which snatches of
straight dialogue take the place of recitative, the his-
trionic amateurishness of the performers was dis-
tressingly obvious. Also, with one or two noteworthy
exceptions, the enunciation of the words in this, as
in other operas, was of such a quality as to reflect
great credit upon the astuteness of the managerial
minion who discovered and announced that the works
are being sung in English.
In Beerbohm Tree’s production of “Joseph and
His Brethren,” at His Majesty’s (London), the
scrumptious Maxine Elliott (Mrs.” Potiphar) sent the
bald-headed critics away all a-tremble; whereupon,
of course, they went back to their highly respectable
offices and hinted their disapproval on high moral
grounds. Said one: “Her amplitude of action and
development of intent left literally nothing to the
imagination.” Another: “Her wooing of Joseph
might have been expressed with less warmth and
color.” And a third declared that no actress ever
put such “significant naughtiness” into her eye as
Maxine did when she baited it for Joseph.

Marie Lohr, having put the newest baby to sleep,
has returned to the stage as leading lady to H. ii.
Irving at the London Savoy. They were to start on
October 4 with a four-act piece called “Le Grand
Seigneur,” dealing with the early period of the
French Revolution.
From London: In spite of its rqwdy first-night
reception, J. M. Barrie’s ‘‘Adored One” is going
pretty strong at London Duke of York’s. He has
carefully revised it, knocked the second and third
acts into one, cut out a lot of the superfluous humor
in the trial scene, and generally pulled the piece
together. On Barrie’s behalf, it, is urged that
audience and critics missed the point of the play on
the first night—which isn’t much to urge on behalf
of any writer. His job is to stick the pin so that
the point can’t be missed.
At Her Majesty’s, Sydney, the other night, where
the Quinlan Grand Opera Co. is holding forth, a
young man was arrested in the stalls on a charge of
stealing a book on the “Ring of the Niebelung”
from the Public Library reference branch. First it
was the Deadwood Dick publications; then, the pic-
ture shows ; now, grand opera—literature, art, music
—-as the sources of corruption in the young. Thank
Heaven, there is musical comedy left.
“Harrison O.”: To Charles Brookfield, who died
the other day in the Cold Country, belongs a good
deal of the credit (or otherwise) of giving a start
to the musical-comedy craze, which only now shows
signs of wilting. “The Poet and the Puppets,” of
which Brookfield was part author (Jimmy Glover,
the Drury Lane conductor, was the other part), was
the pioneer. It was in connection with this piece—a
sort of burlesque on Wilde’s “Lady Windermere’s
Fan”—that Brookfield, who has lately been censor
of other men’s plays, first bumped against the then
examiner of plays, E. S. Piggot, with the result that
some personal references to Wilde had to be hewn
out.
THE DOLL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Any well-known, middle-aged citizen who has paid
for his seat is liable to be merely annoyed at being
singled out and addressed publicly as a Great Big
Beautiful Doll.—' “Sundry Shows” (25/9/’l3).
A well-known citizen was he,
Half-bald and middle-aged ;
Unto his wife and familee
He wired: “I can’t get home to tea—
Am otherwise engaged.”
Then at a local music-hall
That sportive, half-bald cit.,
Bought for himself a front-row stall—
That ticket well might Wowsers call
“Admission to the Pit” !
He thought the “turns” were much the same
As “turns” were in his youth ;
Performing monkeys—very tame —
And ditto comic songs. The game
Seemed quite played out, in sooth.
He yawned through nearly half the show,
Alas, he even slept!
But woke up when a “serio,”
All smiles and leers, into the glow
Of limelight briskly stepped.
And soon, egad ! himself he found—
That half-bald citi-zen— <
The cynosure of all eyes round.
He wondered why, and why the sound
Of “guying” from the men?
But very soon he tumbled to
The shocking fact —’twas plain—
The singer winked her eye of blue
At him ! He blushed and shivered through
The words of her “refrain” :
“You are my doll, my dolly, dear —•
I’ve loved you all my life!”
Oppressive grew the atmosphere
For that poor cit. ; he glanced in fear
Around, and saw his ivife!
She, too —unknown to him —had bought
A ticket for the stalls;
“Sauce for the goose,” he had been taught—
“ She’ll sauce me well enough,” he thought—
“ Look out to-night for squalls!”
Before the damned song was o’er
He slunk out of the place ;
His better half was at the door.
She greeted him: “And this is your
Engagement! You disgrace!”
His mem’ry of that awful shock
Will ne’er in life grow dim—
“A doll!” she shrieked. “You laughing
stock!”
And then proceeded straight to knock
The stuffing out of him !

ROUGH LUCK.
Beards are coming into fashion for men in London
and Paris.—News item.
He : “ Are you having a jolly evening, Miss
Sprightly ? ”
She : “ Only so-so, Mr. Flighty. You see one
cannot ENJOY sitting out a dance When ail
the men are cultivating beards.”
The chucking-out habit grows on the
N.S.W. Ministry. It has thrown out the
proposition to give the Commonwealth a
port at Jervis Bay. It has thrown out the
Governor-General. It proposes to throw
out Railway Commissioner Johnson. And
it suggests throwing out the Federal
Weather Bureau from its rented premises on
the Observatory Hill at Sydney, and
filling the whole place with State astronomi-
cal officials, so that they may drop the time
ball and see stars. The Year-Book of
Australia for 1913 (page 384) thus sums
up the astronomical department of Sydney :
Its most obvious work of immediate practical
importance, however, is in connection with local
time, and a time-ball has been erected on its tower,
220 ft. above sea-level, and visible from nearly all
parts of the harbor.... A time gun is also fired at
Fort Denison at the instant the ball is seen to drop,
but this is not under the Astronomer’s control.
So, if the astronomer isn’t a gunner, why
not simply describe him as a time-baller?
The unfortunate modern girl has many
pious critics and few holy friends. The
other day Sydney Sun took the trouble (or
professed to take the trouble) to pay for a
lengthy cablegram about some obscure and
unnamed doctor (probably named Jones) at
Rhode Island (U.S.A.), who objected to
girls bathing in the sea. This was part of
his moral muddle :
He says that mixed bathing is giving the death-
blow to marriage, and goes on: “I don’t believe one
young man out of 50 wants to marry the girl he
has bathed with.
“In the times gone by men were entranced by
the sight of girls elegantly, daintily and modestly
attired. Then affection sprang from a kind of wor-
ship, something that enchanted. There were no
bare necks, bare arms and legs, and ugly skull caps
then.
“What effect has the ungraceful, flopping, por-
poise-like female on the male intellect ? I watched
the other day two exceedingly pretty girls in
walking costume. They impressed me with their
elegance, but afterwards I saw those two girls waddle
into the surf and try to ride a wooden horse float-
ing in the sea. .
“They returned to the bathing shed, and again I
saw them emerge, clad in their elegant walking
costumes. But to me they were not the same girls.
I had seen them bathe!”
This, be it noted, was alleged to be the
tale of a doctor —a man who cuts up the
more or less nude girl on the operating table
in the interests of humanity. And it is the sort
of stuff which is backed up by the church,
which alleges that the one halcyon period in
the world’s history was when woman wore
nothing at all —not even a split skirt or a
bathing costume. It may be, as slated,
that not one young man in 50 wants
to marry the girl he has bathed with, but
the statement seems improbable. In the
first place, the fact that the girl bathes looks
like a recommendation. Some girls don t
bathe. And in the second place, unless the
young man selects his girl very badly, he
must needs be pleased to see her when she
bathes. Nowadays the British peerage is
largely recruited from the leg-show, and if
the leg that is hot and dry behind the foot-
lights is so attractive, the one that is cool
and wet in the healthy green sea can’t be
utterly objectionable.
The Old Colonists’ Homes at North Fitz-
roy (Vic.) are to have a very useful addi-
tion made to them through the generosity of
Mrs. Sumner, who has persuaded the trustees
of her late husband’s estate to spend a sum
of money sufficient to cover the cost of an
up-to-date hospital. The
accommodation will consist
of 14 beds, an isolation ward
and nurses’ quarters. The
building will be proceeded
with immediately, and Mrs.
Sumner will be asked to lay
the foundation-stone. The
Sumners have made very
many benefactions to the
Homes; in fact, they have
been the largest contribu-
tors. The firm which made
most of the wealth thus dis-
posed of was in the first
’so’s Heape and Grice. In
the middle of the decade
Theodotus John Sumner
joined Richard Grice, and
the signboard then read:
“Grice, Sumner and Co.,
General Merchants.” Their
place was in Flinders-lane.
Some years later, Mr. Sum-
ner was M.L.C. for the Cen-
tral Province. He had a
fine homestead on the Merri-
Merri Creek, not far from
where the Homes are. and,
making a hobby of agricul-
ture. he maintained also a
mrdel farm at Schnapper
Point.
The book of Will Dyson’s cartoons from
London Daily Herald strikes one as being
the cheapest sixpenn’oi'th of illustrations
ever published in England. There are 46
cartoons, and their political character is
told in the editorial preface: —
Will Dvson is the cleverest cartoonist doing work
in Great Britain to-day. It is possibly because he is
a young Australian, coming from the celebrated
school of black-and-white men of the Sydney
Bulletin that he shows such a wholesome disrespect
for so many of our dear British accepted ideas and
institutions. This, indeed, has been the keynote of
the Daily Herald, which is the rallying ground of
rebels against things as they are, and does, perhaps,
in a rough and ready way, strive to make articulate
the various phases of social and economic revolt.
Dyson’s cartoons, for the most part, express
Bulletin doctrines applied to British con-
ditions, and they give this journal the holy
feeling of a missionary society. Take, for
instance, the picture of the scowling em-
ployer, clutching a paper of “Union De-
mands,” and speaking to a lean “Free”
laborer, heavily manacled.
The Master: I’m glad to see you are not one of
those immoral Trades Unionists.
The Scab: No, sir; thank you, sir—l value my
independence as a free-born British Laboring Man
too much, sir! Why, sir—it fair breaks me ’eart
sometimes, sir, to have to share in the benefits they
so cruelly drags from you, sir !
“Port Bow” : A tragic occurrence was the
sinking in Brisbane River of the tug Ches-
terfield while trying to get a line from
the inter-State liner Ivyarra. While cross-
ing the bows of the big vessel the Chester-
field was rolled over like a candle-box, and
the two engineers below probably hadn’t
time to yell. If they had they’ll never men-
tion it this side of Jordan. This is the
class of accident which Sydney goes in
hourly danger of with the crowded ferries
passing and repassing in endless procession
the bows of the great steamers (some as big
as two Kyarras) that move up and down the
harbor. The chance of a ferry being cut in
two is not so much to be dreaded as the risk
of being turned over. I reckon in that
awful event there would be IT seconds in
which to get into lifebelts. The Chester-
field tragedy is a mournful advertisement
for the North Shore: bridge.

The popular gag of the moment has to do
with the astonishing popularity of George
Reid in England. Reid’s success as a
laugliter-maker is nut forward as a reason
why Australia should be proud of him. He
is represented as having been an amazing
success. The perspective is all wrong,
Almost any moderately gifted comedian could
have done as well (or as badly) in .London
as Reid has. The difference between the
regard that London has for Reid and the
regard ihat it had for say Choate of the
L.S., lies m the tact that it laughed witl
Choate, whereas it laughs at Reid. The
whole world is delighted at the clowning
of the sort of person at whom it can
laugh—barring, of course, the humorist’s
near relatives. Most people number among
their acquaintances someone who is always
doing absurd things, whose entry sets the
room in a sort of subdued roar, who is highly
popular, but totally lacking in that dignity
which wins respect. Reid is like that.
When he jests at a big London banquet on
the subject of his immense girth, imperish-
able digestion and kindred topics the audience
roars. And naturally so. In the first place
there is the staggering novelty of one in an
ambassadorial position conducting himself so ;
and in the second there is the comforting
fact that he belongs to someone else, so to
speak. If Asquith or Bonar Law or Bal-
four or Sir Edward Grey cut loose with
jokes about his stomach Britain would be
so scandalised that the downfall of the mis-
guided fun-maker would be a mere question
of weeks. If the Ambassador from the
Court of St. James’s at Paris or Vienna or
St. Petersburg convulsed the representatives
from the other chancelleries and the rest of
the high local dignitaries with primi-
tive wit of the sort, he would be recalled
almost before his humorous sally was over.
Why should a different standard be set in
the case of Australia? The Commonwealth
undoubtedly gets a certain amount of ad-
vertisement from the sort of humor that its
High Commissioner specialises in. But it
is not the right sort of advertisement, and
that sort is about 17 times worse than none,
The other day C.J. Madden examined a
motor-’bus from all angles and decided that
it was not a stage coach within the mean-
ing of the Act. The vehicle was licensed
as a hackney carriage for the City of Mel-
bourne, but it drifted into foreign parts
and carted the gentle punter from Mentone
to the adjacent racecourse. The result was
that the Cheltenham Bench jumped on the
owner and fined him for not having the
weapon licensed as a stage coach. An appeal
to the Supreme Court followed, and Madden
laid it down that a stage coach is a vehicle
which runs habitually from one terminus
to another, with the names of the stages
painted on it. So in the eye of the Law,
far as it relates to traffic, the motor-’bus
ranks, apparently, with the ice-cream chariot
and the rabbit-oh outfit.
“Briner” : Shipmasters are keenly inter-

The Church has not much sympathy with
the theory that cleanliness is next to godli-
ness ; there remains still something of the
old antipathy to washing as a doubtful, pagan
practice. Recently Melbourne Board of
Health made a move with the object of in-
ducing the churches to use separate com-
munion cups, pointing out that the use of
a common cup, like the use of a common
Bible in police courts, is dangerous and in-
sanitary. Archbish. Clarke has just replied
that the Lambeth Conference laid it down
that “the use of separate cups is not desir-
able” ; and he pointed out, further, that the
communion is a religious rite, wherefore the
Board should not disturb it in any way.
Two wrongs may not make one right, but it
is now plain that one rite may make a pre-
posterous wrong. It is recorded, by tne
way, that the folk of the Early Church hac
all things in common—lands, money, houses
and goods. Apparently the common use o
a drinking vessel is the last survival ot tha
halcyon age.

Shot with a silver sheen ;
Will they be spangled or
Rosy as peaches?
Will they be slily slit,
Showing a stocking fit,
Or will they be but bags
Posing as breeches?

Satin and silk array,
Loose robes or tubulars
Clipping like leeches,
Gone are your glories now,
Gone like the gallant’s bow,
Way must ye make for the

No more shall pretty pets
Rage for Equality’s

MEN’S OUTFITTERS,

The I.W.W. has got a new grievance, inas-
much as the Brisbane police have been trying
to suppress an epidemic of Socialist or
Anarchist meetings in the streets, and have
been prosecuting Cicero and Demosthenes for
refusal to move on. Also, when Stentor
didn’t pay his fine, he had to take it out —
in other words, he was shot in. This is de-
nounced as “an unwarranted attack on the
citizens’ right of free speech.” Quite a
large book could be written on that mis-
used expression—a book of legal defini-
tions. What is, or what is not, free speech?
Generally speaking, it is the right to say
anything except “blanky” and kindred ex-
pressions, always provided you don’t call a
bigger man than yourself a liar, incite to
crime, falsely accuse a citizen of felony or
leprosy, or say that his father was hanged,
impugn a woman’s honor when her big
brother is within hearing, or do any one of
about 2000 other things, which include being
a deadly bore. These are the limitations as
regards the quality of the speech. As re-
gards the quantity, it isn’t advisable to
speak freely till you fall down dead through
fatigue,. for the spectacle is objectionable.
And it isn’t advisable to be so buried in free
speech as to have no time for work, for then
you must live as a parasite of one kind or
another. Then the location of free speech
must be considered. It is absolutely un-
reasonable to expect this priceless boon (1)
in the middle of a busy pavement; (2)
on the gangway of the ferry steamer; (3)
at the turnstile where you pay your penny
as you come off the ferry. (One day, years
ago, half North Sydney went raving mad
because a pleasant old lady tried to tell the
whole story of her life to the man at the
turnstile, just when the suburb was rushing
to its office at 9 a.m., to start the Business
Robbery of the day) ; (4) on the tram-line;
(5) at midnight, in the sleeping compart-
ment of the express; (6) in the steamboat
smoking-room—free speech puts the bridge-
players off their oats in a manner of speak-
(7) in a pub (to the barmaid) when
16 dry souls are trying to catch her eye for
a drink; (8) in church, because it wakes
up the congregation; (9) in the dress circle
of the theatre; (10) in a multitude of other
places. Inside these and a lot more limita-
tions, free speech is about the grandest thing
on earth, and everybody should have it, pro-
vided he doesn’t snuffle or drop his “h’s.”

It won’t be long now before Mel-
bourne’s collection of depressing statuary is
joined by Margaret Baskerville’s big bronze
figure of Tummus Bent, which is completed
and ready to be set up in Brighton, at the
corner of Bay-street and Point Nepean-
road. There is no special fault to be found
with the sculptor’s work, but Mikeangelo
himself could not have made an impressive
figure of the defunct market gardener and
land boomer and teller of amazing tales.
The statue is more interesting than it de-
serves to be, because of the method of its
making. The bronze was placed in the

moulds and beaten into shape, instead of
being melted and poured in. This was also
done with N’Yark’s much-boomed Statue of
Liberty, but in that case the parts were lap-
jointed and riveted, whereas in the local
work they have been welded by a new pro-
cess, so that the joins are quite invisible.

Some evidence that might have been use-
ful to N.S.W. Industrial Court Judge Hey-
don, in his cost-of-living inquiry, was re-
cently published at Sydney Central Police
Court. A Pure Foods Inspector there pro-
duced a cargo of tinned oysters, salmon and
meat, part of eight cases found on the
premises of the man he was prosecuting.
Some of the dainty goods were fly-blown;
according to the labels some more of them
were canned 16 years ago; and the whole
lot was unfit for human consumption.
When the flabbergasted inspector asked what
he was going to do with the delicacies, the
defendant said he proposed to send them to
the auction rooms. One similar lot had been
already sold to a dealer, who vended it from
his stall in the markets of a workers’ suburb
at 3d. a tin, or 2s. a dozen —which proves
that food is cheap, if you get it at the right
place.
The Law is a joyful and exhilarating con-
trivance sometimes. At Redfern (Sydney
suburb) recently, a party of bobbies care-
fully raided a greengrocer’s shop and ar-
rested the principal contents on a charge of
gambling. At the court subsequently, the
proceedings had barely started when the
solicitor for the defence objected to the war-
rant being put in on the ground that it was
issued under the Gaming Act of 1902. Last
year the gaming laws were consolidated, and
the 1902 Act became the Act of 1912. The
State representative nearly melted in an
effort to convince the Beak
that the 0 in 1902 really
meant 1, and that a mere
clerical error didn’t upset
the fact that the accused
had been gambling, but it
was no go. Balaam said
that his vehicle would stop
dead if it wasn’t allowed to
do things in its characteristic way, so he
dismissed the case with a whisk of the
animal’s fail, as it were.
The usual crowd of people was awaiting
the customary ferry-boat at Milson’s Point
(Sydney) last week, when the welkin was
suddenly punctured by a loud crack, and a
vast bang, that made the ear-drums tremble.
Women screamed, men swore loudly and
without reservation, and children” wept
miserably, and kicked their owners when
chided. Simultaneously, a small and horri-
fied boy hurtled through the air, seemingly
from nowhere, and landed with a howl of
dread in the midst of the crowd. It tran-
spired that the human missile had been gaz-
ing inoffensively on the peaceful afternoon
scene through the window of the ferry build-
ing, when he felt a gigantic hoist as though
the Lord of Hosts had kicked him savagely,
and the next thing he knew was that he was
on the. pontoon with a broken shoulder or
something. Altogether three people went to
hospital, a gas explosion in the innards of
the building being to blame. What vexes
your thinking citizen is that, at North Syd-
ney, though it is hard to get enough gas
to cook the dinner properly, and though the
light is never sufficiently bright for the ar-
tistic housewife to work point lace by, yet
there. always seems to be enough pressure on
to bi’ing about this sort of useless and dan-
gerous demonstration.

Said the Rev. S. D. Yarrington lately in
Sydney:—
The prevalence of opium smoking constitutes a
public scandal. The police have only touched the
fringe of a problem which has recently grown to
such an extent that it is positively a public menace.
. . . .Those three houses are the resorts of at least
seven white girls. Their ages range from 26 years
to nearly 40. At certain times, generally at night,
the whole seven are there.
Yet the Rev. Yarrington sternly declined to
give the police the assistance of his know-
ledge as to the location of these dens. And
how can three dens live on selling opium to
seven girls, aged nearly 40 —a fraction over
two girls apiece? If they had seven solvent
elephants as customers it wouldn’t do much
more than keep the business alive, unless
an elephant smokes more opium than this
paper ever heard of.
God’s eternal and long-suffering sea has an
unpleasant trick of occasionally throwing
back some of the rubbish that is heaved into
it. A week or so back, the Manly surfer
shot his breakers and splashed amongst a lot
of refuse that had been .punted out to sea
on account of the blundering Sydney muni-
cipalities. The average Sydney council has
only two ideas on the garbage question—if
it can’t spread the nuisance on the local
park it must be taken out to sea. And
the mariners and punt-men who attend to the
job seem to empty their loads soon after pass-
ing the Heads; so the channel silts up, the
fishing is destroyed, and the surfing beach
is haunted by all sorts of horrors. But
occasionally the council takes a strong stand
and disposes of the rubbish question by
ignoring it. The- writer of this paragraph
recently moved to a flourishing North Shore
suburb where the garbage question is settled
periodically by every resident with a shovel
in his own back yard. The arrival of the
usual dustman of civilisation was awaited
patiently for the first two weeks; then, at
the instigation of the lady of the house, a
polite letter of inquiry was sent to the shire
clerk. In due course a reply was received.
There was not, and never had been, a dust-
man in the district. So the writer tem-
porarily laid down the pen for the shovel, and
wondered if there could be any escape from
the dust-box drudgery by way of the devilish
Ulreater Sydney scheme.

Died in Melbourne the other day, John
Creuze Ogier, aged 92. He came to Vic-
toria in the ’so’s as an English barrister
looking for gold, and was eventually ap-
pointed to the police magistracy, where he
became deeply involved in unpopularity.
After he had lost his P.M., the contentious
Ogier spent some years in getting compen-
sation. By way of making himself nasty to
the'Government in his old age, he questioned
Victoria’s claim to include the Riverina
within its boundaries, and the arguments he
advanced are still under legal discussion.
The old barrister was a controversialist to
the bitter end.
It will be 78 years to-morrow (October
31) since Melbourne got its first publican’s
license. John Pascoe Fawkner was the
licensee. Melbourne not being then named,
the permit was issued in Sydney, for pre-
mises to be provided in “the Port Phillip
settlement,” where Johnny had camped two
months before.

J. A. Panton, for nearly half a century
Victoria’s best-known police magistrate,
didn’t long survive his friend Casey.
The friendship of the pair began in the oid
days of Bendigo, where Casey ran a papei
and Panton was Lands Commissioner first
and then (in 1858) magistrate. Neither
Casey nor Panton was much of a lawyer;
but they both had‘a lot of hard common-
sense, and more justice was done than usual
in Casey’s County Court and in Panton’s
Melbourne Police Court.
The S. Aus. Government, being quietly
sounded, expressed its complete willingness
to accept a proffered soldier as State Gover-
nor after its present sailor. The difference
is that, while Sir Day Bosanquet had never
before commanded anything except a fleet
or a harbor, the new man has his foot on
the ladder as a professional Governor. Sir
Ilebry Galway is 54. He spelt it "Gallwey”
till he was 52, when he changed it to the
Irish form. Presumably he was tired of
always seeing it misspelt. He has had nine
drowsy years of St. Helena, and several very
lively ones of West Africa; in the latter
country he was Commissioner of various
districts, where it was often necessary to go
and chastise a monarch who had exceeded
the speed-limit. At present he is Governor
of Gambia. Having at last secured a White
country to live in, he married last August
the handsome widow of a Baron d’Erlanger
—an Englishwoman. Governor Bosanquet is
going to see his five-years’ term fully out,
but won’t be seen in Adelaide very much
more, as he is going to spend the summer in
the Hills.

ELECTIONEERING PREPARA HONS.
In a moment the whole hall was in an uproar, and
men and women stood on the chairs and yelled at
each other, while the contestants uppercut and hooked
and swung with such effect that their faces were
blood-smeared.... There were cries of “Rats!”
“Balderdash!” groans, cat-calls and bursts of cheers
and applause as the rival factions took in the pur-
port of the resolution. —A Willoughby Liberal item.

The appointment of Rufus Isaacs to the
Lord Chief Justiceship of England should
mean, amongst other things, the return to
Parliament of Captain Leslie Wilson,
D. 5.0., and some time A.D.C. to the late
Governor liawson, of N. S. Wales. When
Wilson was first put up against Isaacs in the
Conservative interest, at Reading, where the
biscuits come from, he was laughed at by
liberalism as the most forlorn-hope candi-
date imaginable. He was duly defeated.
But the next time he contested the seat the
complexion of things was altered. The
Liberal organisers found that Wilson, who
lives in the constituency, had been making
appalling progress with the electors. Isaacs
was sent for in haste, and so grave a view
did he take of the situation that lie came
down and worked personally like a Hebrew
demon —a thing he had never felt called
upon to do before. Despite all his efforts
he only beat the politically-unknown Wilson
by 99 votes. Wilson is the ideal candidate.
His A.D.C.’s manners go down splendidly
with the women. He has unlimited time at
his disposal wherein to canvass the neighbor-
hood ; a nice place to ask the right sort of
voter to; and plenty of money wherewith
to provide the voter in question with such
things as the law allows. If he is to be
defeated at the coming by-election the
Asquith party will need to send up one of
its largest guns ; and even then the ammu-
nition will probably prove ineffective.
Louis Becke. whose South Sea and other
yarns have given pleasure to tens of thou-
sands of Australians, lies buried in an un-
marked grave at Waverley (N.S.W.). A
few of the dead writer’s friends want to
see some kind of memorial raised on the
spot, and are gathering a few pounds for
the purpose. The treasurer of the fund is
Farmar Whyte, of the S. M. Herald, to
whom contributions should be sent.
Died lately, at Sapphire Creek, Papua,
Denis Edward O’Doherty, a battler in most
Australian gold rushes from the Palmer to
the Murchison, where he made a punch out
of the Lady Forrest float. Once, being
flush, he tried the Melbourne Stock Ex-
change, and left well skinned. With Eng-
ish backing, he prospected in Rhodesia and
;he Gold Coast (Africa) ; and ex-G.-G.
N’orthcote was behind him in a go at the
Northern Territory. Falling sick, he went
to Sapnhire Creek for a spell. Most men
would have tried a city; but O’Doherty, if
he was to die, wanted to die comfortably,
so it was a prospector’s camp and in the
end a prospector’s grave for him.
What a Jekyll and Hyde the late Dill
Macky was! .jekyll has been known, out of
his great charity, to take the boots off his
own feet when a man, tramping for work,
came almost barefooted to his door. Then
he called up the yellow dog from its kennel,
and, transformed into Hyde, out of his great
lack of charity there was hardly a foulness
he wasn’t ready to impute to the dreadful
Scarlet Woman of his dreams.
Justice Joshua Williams, who has been
called from Maoriland’s Supreme Court
bench to the judicial committee of the
Privy Council, holds the long distance record
in the Unstable Islands as a judge—3B
years. The P.C. appointment takes him
back to London, where he was born 76 years
ago. He was 24 years .old when he landed
in M.L., 34 when he accepted the Registrar-
Generalship of Lands ; and 38 when lie
started to wear a hole in the doorstep at the
judges’ entrance to the Supreme Court. It
is a fairly sizeable hole now. One of the
notable cases which Judge Williams re-
fereed followed the crash of Joseph Ward’s
Farmers’ Association, an occasional echo of
which still resounds in the land after 18 or
19 years. Williams had a brief flutter at
politics in his youth. The year after he
arrived in M.L. he sat as a member of the
Provincial Council of Canterbury (1862-3),
and again in 1866-70. In between times lie
was chancellor of the University of Otago,
first chairman of the Board of Governors of
Canterbury College, and first judge of the
Arbitration Court. In fact, our learned
brother has had a strenuous career. And
lie’s still a-going it.
Australia has just acquired a man from
Mexico who isn’t likely to join in the chorus
when some clubman says. that Capital is
leaving the country, or, if it isn’t, it ought
to. His name is Laird, and he arrived by
the San Francisco mail steamer, a week or
so back, to take on the job of superintendent
at the Great Cobar copper mines. Laird’s
last job was in the place where Huerta has
been throwing things at Felix Diaz. The mine
in which he was interested had been damaged
to the extent of £250.000, and another
£150,000 would be wanted to get the water
out of it, while the plant had got bullet-
scarred and rusty. lie had been waiting for
two and a half years for the country to
simmer down and give poor old Capital a
chance; but as politics, at the end of that
period, were boiling over more furiously
than ever, he decided to get out and come to
peaceful Australia, where the Labor party
rages like a pet lamb, and the tiger of Sosh
purrs sleepily on the hearthrug alongside its
saucer of milk.
Father Wolff, who died in a Brisbane
hospital the other dav, was probably the
only R.C. priest who was ever a Mayor, in
Australia. It happened at Blackall —out
towards the place where the dead men lie
and the live men haven’t time for any in-
sectarian foolishness.
It isn't settled, but. if the Minister ap-
proves the director’s recommendations, and
the Public Service Commissioner has nothing
to say against it, the officering of the Light-
house inspection service will go to Captain
Sim, of the trawler Endeavor; Captain
Hood, of the Torres pilot service; Bulger,
of the Lady Loch; and Airlie, of Albany.
Sim’s beat will be the North Coast; Hood’s
the region of the Barrier Reef, and down to
Brisbane; Bulger’s from Brisbane to the
S.A. Cape of Northumberland; and Airlie
will manage the rest —a mere matter of 2900
miles.
INTRODUCING BABY AT

Dr. Benjnfleld (Tas. ) said that in Glenorehy there
had in three years been only tour deaths in 1000.
The average age of the tom was flu years. In an
adjoining; district of tin- Tasman Peninsula Inst year
there were four death:- in moo pen-one. Two wore
drowned, one was a detormed in,.ml. who could not
live, and the fourth had taken poison,
Mr C. T. Fisher (S.A) stated that in the district
of Marsdens, not far from Adelaide, there had been
seven people. six of whom wire now dead, whose
uses aggregated 614 year.
“Come. lute, Methuselah, and tell Mr. Sack-
butt how old you me.'’
From the Western Pacific Herald we
learn with as much regret as there’s space
left for, that Sosocini Tamanikairukuru-
kuiovalau has died in the Levuka Hospital.
Sooner or later it was bound to be fatal.

ARCHBISH WRIGHT IN HIS
SYNOD RIG-OUT.
The late Edward Braddon’s old home-
stead at Leith, on the north-west coast of
Tasmania, was burned down a few days
ago. The house was big and two-storeyed,
mounted on top of a hill, whence it com-
manded a splendid view over land and sea.
The late father of the alleged “Blot” was
something of an art connoisseur, and, in
his time, the house was stocked with trea-
sures; and until this fire wiped them ouf
many of the door panels were still decorated
with rather fine paintings by the picturesque
old man’s artistic wife.
From the Oldest Inhabitant: —
Margaret Catchpole has been again “discovered";
they won’t let the poor old Suffolk horse-sweater
rest in her grave. This time the discovery is made
by a writer named Charles Jackson Campbell, who
says Margaret’s remains were found in Devonshire-
street (Sydney) cemetery when the site was cleared
for the “Central” Railway Station. All an error
The “Margaret Catchpole” whose bones were removed
from the Devonshire-street cemetery was Mrs. Mary
Reiby, an educated woman, while the real Margaret
was very illiterate. In the register of St. Peter’s
Church of England, Richmond (N.S.W.), will be
found this entry in the handwriting of Parson Ful-
ton: “Margaret Catchpole, aged 51 years, came pris-
oner in the Nile in the year 1801; was buried May
14,' 1819. Henry Fulton.” The only resemblance
between the pair was that both were involved in “love
affairs,” and were expatriated for horse-sweating in
connection with their escapades, the one from Lan-
cashire, the other from Suffolk.
The “Gallery Hand” passes the prophecy
pot:—
I reckon this is how the roster will read if Hol-
man’s Government is sent along at the end of the
year. Premier: Wade; but without portfolio. He's
had a hard time lately, and, besides, there’s going
to be an awful scramble for a terrible few port-
folios. Treasurer: Waddell. Cohen has been men-
tioned, but as a financial expert during the past
three years he has shown himself no better than
Waddell, and he hasn’t Waddell’s capacity for
affability in tight places. Chief Secretary:
“Splinters” Wood. Education: Varney Parkes (can
you hear the Yellow Pup say, “Ah! Now it’s OUR
turn!’”). Works: Tom ’Enley. Attorney-General:
1 hate to doxdt, but I’ve got to say that Daniel Levy,
the little police-court attorney, will take some pla-
cating. Lord forbid that I should suggest he would
ioin the conservative party on the University
Senate if he were thrown down, but the world is
full of ingratitude. Lands and Agriculture will pro-
bablv fall *-o Hall fis Ball also among the pro-
phets?) and McEarlane. In case no portfolio is
forthcoming, Cohen will no doubt beat Henry Willis
for the Speakership. And after that Henry Willis
will beat Cohen on points of order and disorder.
WHAT THE HORSES MISSED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Since landing-, High Commissioner George Reid
has spent much of his time running about Melbourne
in a big yellow motor-car. — Melb. paper. .
He lounged back in the motor-car,
George Reid, a man too great by far.
With frequent lifting of his lid,
He bowled along the city streets.
His Highness filled three peoples’ seats —.
At any rate, his wideness did.
All men seemed glad to see him there,
His bingv terraced in the air.
No single creature turned to, scoff ;
They cheered him with uncommon vim—
Australians recognised in him,
If not our land, the fat thereof.
Yet no mere man along his routes
Was half so glad as were the brutes.
Upon the ranks, and, outside bars,
Cab horses watched with thankful eyes ;
You might have heard their gracious sighs:
“Oh, thank the gods for motor-cars!”
VICTORIA.

'1 he fact that the Colonial again shows a shade more
profits than in the previous term may be taken as a
hint that, in the opinion of the management, nothing
serious has happened, and that the outlook is, if
anything, a trifle better than when the directors last
had their say. Nevertheless both deposits and ad-
vances have shrunk during the past year:—

The Bulletin has no complaint to make regarding
the reduction of advances, which doesn’t even neces-
sarily mean that anybody’s toes have been trodden
on. As a matter of fact, this bank had been lending
rather beyond its resources; and if it hinted to its
trading clients that their merchandise stocks were a
bit too heavy, it was probably justified. Anyway,
it was more than justified in increasing its own
holding of liquid assets to 35 p.c. of its liabilities.
Its previous holding looked too small to be safe in
times that promised to be troublous. The present
35 p.c., if it is maintained, should do very nicely ;
in fact, the bank might be entitled on the figures to
pass out at least eighteenpence to help some lame dog
of a customer over his last ditch. As for deposits,
and speaking in a general banking way, they will pro-
bably not shrink much more. The wool clip is good
and prices excellent, and if the coming wheat harvest
isn’t likely to be all a wheat harvest should be, it
isn’t going to be what one might be. And the dis-
mal gentlemen who were always coming across
Capital packing up his traps for an ocean voyage
have been little heard from of late. After looking
round, Capital has seemingly decided that he could
go further and fare worse.
The Colonial’s capital is £304,044 in 31,184 pref.
shares fully paid to £9 155., and £135,236 in
77,278 ordinaries of £4 ss. paid to £1 15s. The
prefs. are entitled to a first 5 p.c. and the same rate
as ordinaries when more than 5 p.c. is paid. When
the prefs. have had 14 half-yearly divs. of 7 p.c. or
more, the, preference as to capital ceases. Four more
half-yearly divs. at the present rate, and then all
shares Will rank alike except that the prefs. will be
it lea to 5 p.c. as a sure thing if the profits can
stand it. When that position is reached, or when
the management is dead sure that it can be reached,
some of the unpaid capital will no doubt be got in
from the ordinary shareholders, provided the money
market is favorable. The present capital is none too
large for the business even now: there is a little over
£6 of the public’s for every £1 of the shareholders’
money. Allotting to the two classes of shares their
proportion of the reserves, the assets in excess of
liabilities represent £l4 11s. per share for the prefs.
and £2 12s. per share for the ordinaries. The
market values them at about £ll 10s. and 365. 6d.
Whether the reserves are sound or not depends upon
the quality oF the assets. And in that connection it
has to be remembered that a bank has something
more than its own funds out at its own risk ; in
this case it has £3,106,376, exclusive of premises
and public securities, or about 44 times more. On
the other hand, the visible reserves are not a well-
conducted bank’s only provision for ordinary contin-
gencies. Most banks don’t admit an internal reserve
against bad and doubtful debts, but the Colonial
does. Calculated on capital and reserves combined,
profits have lately been as follows:
Profits as Compared with Shareholders’ Funds.
Mar., 1910 £8 2 4 p.c. Mar, 1912 £9 2 6 p.c.

Mar., 1911 8 0 0 „ Mar., 1913 8 16 3 „
Sept., 1911 8 3 10 „ Sept., 1913 8 15 0 „
And though there are banks that make a better show-
ing, on the face of them these figures suggest that
there are not many lame ducks among the assets, or,
if there are lame ducks, reasonable allowance has
been made for their infirmity when valuing them.

This is the baby in the family of Australasian banks ;
and as it was born in 1888, the stork which attends
to these matters hasn’t had a busy time. But if
the number of banks hasn’t increased the available
business has. The Royal arrived during the second
quarter of 1888, and it is worth while considering
the growth of the banks’ possibilities since then.

A comparison of the deposits and advances gives a
remarkable result; while the former have increased
nearly 71 p.c., the latter are only about 164 Pc.
greater. The fact, of course, is that nowadays the
banks hold a much larger amount of coin and bul-
lion—over £36,000,000 as against £18,000,000,
notwithstanding that they have £5,000,000 less of
their notes in circulation and liable to be presented
for gold. The banking position is, therefore, vastly
stronger than it was in 1888 —-as it ought to be, re-
membering what happened shortly after 1888. Still,
though the banks’, capacity for mohey-iuaking hasn’t
increased as fast as one might expect from the
growth of the deposits, the increase of' 161' p.c, in
the advances is substantial; and then there is the
enormous development of the exchange business, fol-
lowing on the increase of foreign trade. Yet, as re-
marked before, until the Commonwealth Batik arrived
the other day, there hadn’t been a birth in the
family for 25 years, so there are no new mouths to
feed. On the contrary, several boom weaklings,
never quite recognised as members of the family,
disappeared in the early ’9o’s.
The Royal didn’t make the mistake, of trying to
push itself all over the place in its early days. "For
many years it confined itself to Melbourne; then,
as it got friends elsewhere, it opened a few branches,
though even now it has less than half-a-dozen.
Working expenses have thus always been distinctly
moderate; and, as the management had sound ideas
regarding reserves, dividends have never got out of
hand. The result is a very fine accumulation of
reserves. Assuming that these reserves' are sound
(m other words, assuming that the advances and
other assets are not overvalued), there is now nearly
345. per share in excess of all liabilities. Last sales
of these shares were at 265. 6d.—a pretty good indi-
cation that the market either doesn’t believe that the
reserves are sound or (what is more likely) doesn’t
take into account much besides the interest yield.
This paper isn’t at all disposed to whoop up the
price of any shares ; it merely observes, as an amaz-
ing thing, that, when the prospectus of a new co. is
issued, the public will pay tens of thousands of
pounds for the goodwill of a business, in addition to
20s. in the £ for all the assets, whereas it not only
is not prepared to pay anything at all for the good-
will of a business such as this, biit actually writes its
declared reserves down by more than 50 per cent.
There is, certainly, no way of telling whether the
reserves are worth 20s. in the £. A sort of test is
provided by their earning power, coupled with that
of the capital; and, as to that, here are the figures
for some terms past:—
Profits as Compared with Shareholders' Funds.

But it is not conclusive, for high earnings may re-
sult, not from undervalued but from risky securities,
among other things. However, so far as they mean
anything, the figures are excellent. And so are some
other figures. Take the data supplied by the balance-

The liabilities on all accounts amount to

so there is less than £4- 10s. of the public’s coin
for every £1 of the shareholders’ money in the
business —a very moderate and safe proportion. And
of the public’s money 52 p.c. is in liquid assets —
and that is a large proportion, which in this ease
means not only safety, but the, ability to give con-
siderable further help to the bank’s customers when
the right securities are available.

Twelve months ago the capital was £96,351; now
it is £125,683, and for underwriting the new issue
£1582 was paid and has come out of the year’s
profits. Seeing that the concern was comfortably
paying 7 p.c., and in 1911-12 made just on 10 p.c.,
and seeing, moreover, that there were reserves repre-
senting over 6s. Bd. in the £ of the capital, Heaven
and the directors alone know why £1582 was paid
for underwriting the issue at par. It looks much
more as though it was a case for a premium. Cer-
tainly the co. hadn’t the best of reputations once ;
but that was in its unregenerate days, and things
have been, to all appearances, thoroughly cleaned up
since then. The table starts from this clean-up. At
that time foreclosed properties of the written-down
value of £54,071 were on the books; and that the
writing-down was vigorous enough was subsequently
proved by the bagging of surpluses as the properties
were sold. Of late no surpluses or profits on sales
have been shown, which suggests that they have
been turned over to some internal contingency fund.
As the old properties have been realised the money
along with the new deposits and capital, has been put
into new advances. The position has changed this
way:—

Cash .. 4,779 2,548 48 2,093 17,020
Excellent progress has thus been made in clearing
off the old properties; and very few, if any, new
ones have fallen in to replenish the heap. Not that
this latter means much: it isn’t in a rising or firm
property market that foreclosures hit a building
society. Still, given even fair management, there
Shouldn’t be the makings of many bad debts among
the present advances. Trouble comes when a bad
slump follows quickly on a period of large ad-
vances. In this case, though a lot of money has
been advanced during the last few years, and though
prices have been high, work and money have been
olentiful, hence the repayments of principal ought
to have been kept well up. And with a very fair
season ahead of Victoria there shouldn’t be any
change in that respect. As for the deposits, they
are of course very fully protected: the slump that
could make the assets worth less than £78,268 even
for quick realisation can hardly be conceived.

As with most building societies* there are two classes
of shares —permanent and investing. The latter are
built up by instalments, and when the last instal-
ment is in, the principal, along with interest and
bonus-dividends, may be withdrawn. A few of these
shares have been paid out during the year;
hence the capital has shrunk a trifle. The £394 of
forfeited capital now added to the reserves repre-
sents instalments paid on shares which are
“dead”; under the rules when no instalments have
been paid for 20 years, the money previously paid
goes to the society, being transferred, in effect,
from capital to reserves. The Langridge has had a
remarkable history: it lost money, like the rest of
them, in the boom, but it didn’t lose so much that
it had to even write off any share capital. Divi-
dends, of course, had to be cut; but nothing beyond
that was necessary to see the society through. Now
practically all the old trouble has been got rid of,
and, except for a thousand or two, all the capital
and borrowed money is in new advances, etc., on
building-society terms. The following table shows
the progress made:—

The liabilities are still very moderate; which means
that, while the depositors have splendid security, the
shareholders risk not a great deal more than their
own money. The profits, taking that fact into
account, are very excellent indeed. Frankly, consider-
ing the terms on which the State (through the Sav-
ings Bank) nowadays finances purchasers of houses
and shops (it has lent out nearly 1J millions in under
three years), this paper doesn’t know how the
Langridge does it. And it knows even less how the
society is.going to keep on doing it.

The capital is £30,000, equal to £1 per share paid,
and there is £4 uncalled. That, with the £12,316
of reserves, offers a very solid guarantee that there
w , Y. e n ,° hanky-panky with the estates left in this
co. s hands. Although the shareholders aren’t in any
visible danger of being called upon to pay out now,
they must have had a few sleepless nights when
Melbourne was recovering from its jag in the early
90 s, and securities were slumping and beneficiaries,
not getting what they had expected, looked round
for a stone to fling at somebody—the executor for
choice. The executor (as in -this case) had troubles
with his own investments, too; hence the dividend
(U P-c.) in 1899 was the first that was paid after
the smash of the boom. The co. then crept up very
?o«o Ua ?to the present 7 p.c.—the highest since
*•11 V w “ en 3 P‘ c ‘ was paid. But the reserves are
stall by no means conspicuous, so the directors will
do well to stick to the 7 p.c., and not attempt to
go any higher for a while—certainly not until the
mortgage on the premises acquired in Q,ueen : street
has been rooted right out. Lately £2OOO was
hacked off, leaving £2950 still to be dealt with.
Ihis and £3l of sundries are the only liabilities.
Against that and the shareholders’ funds (capital
a ?i/^ rves - ) i there are these ass ets: Public securities,
£11,200; advances on mortgage, £7506; bank de-
posits, £ 287 5; advances to beneficiaries, £8222-
and the Queen-street freehold, £13,950; with a trifle
in cash and etceteras. “Commissions, rents and
interest have moved in this cheerful way: 1903
, £479 V , 1912 ’ £8094; 1913, £B6Bl. Rents and
interest from mortgages very likely bring in more
than they did a few years ago ; but the big increase
the composite item in recent years seems to show
that the co. is making good headway also in the
matter of trusts in hand. No figures can, however
be given on that point, the Melbourne Perpetual being
one of the few remaining trustee cos. that don’t
supply them. All that the directors say is that “the
business in hand is sufficient to justify an optimistic
v u ew , °L the eomln ff y ear ” ; and they “urge all
shareholders to personally assist in promoting the
business of the co. to their own manifest advantage ”
WeH, the advertising expert would probably tell
them that one of the best ways to get more estates
to manage is to announce the size of the estates they
have already been trusted to manage. No man wants
to be the fool who rushes in where angels feared
to tread—before they became angels, of course.

The business had been muddling along on a small
capital for many years. Then Thomas Davis, an ac-
countant with ideas and energy, took it in hand
and got in some more money. There was evidently
a heap of business waiting to be done; and the
amount that was done made people wonder for a
while, whether the management, being more ’or less
ne ' v , to £he time-payment line, wasn’t taking trade
which other older hands at the game were declining
No doubt it was with a view to settling doubts on
this point that the co.’s auditors were invited last
year to investigate the whole hire-agreement opera-
tions. The report was very satisfactory: the total of
arrears was found to be under 6 p.c., and, though
there had been a percentage of forfeitures, inev'it-
fiT e ln c ° ndu ct of a tiihe-payment business,
those suffered have been dealt with promptly. Anv
loss after re-sale has not been great and has been
en Sl ly borne by the profits, and such few returned ;
struments as may be undisposed of at stoevtov
are valued at cost or under.” There is ™ „ klll »

Of the book debts, which are thus £31,538 more

on_ time-payment sales. The actual amount t
paid is 3.186,249, but the odd £20,529 is deducted
on account of unearned interest and to pay for in-'
su ranee. “There have not been any bad debts in
connection with hire-agreements,” the directors sav
“whilst the total arrears, or unpaid instalments are
n °j- in , excf)SS °f the co.’s low percentage”—pre’sum-
ably the 6 p c. or less mentioned in the special re-
port before alluded to. Though there is now another
£31,538 on the books, the co.’s own liabilities it
will be noted, have grown by only £6432 The
balance has been provided partly by a small in
crease in capital but chiefly by the reduction of
stock-in-trade and the accumulation of reserves. These
reserves are growing pretty well, and it is the an-
nounced policy of the management to pay no more
than 7£ p.c. until they have reached £50,000.
Seeing that time-payment purchases are made bv
people who haven’t got the cash to pay for them it
looks as though the losses should be heavy. But (1)
the time-payment purchaser pays a deposit of 10 p.c
or more; (2) if he doesn’t complete the payments
the goods are taken back, since he hasn’t bou"ht
them, but only “hired” them; (3) the goods don’t
go out until the dealer is satisfied that the “hirer’s”
position ensures the payment of at anv rate the
early instalments; (4) after the “hirer” has paid
the deposit and a few instalments, he can be de-
pended on to make a hard struggle to pay the bal-
ance, rather than lose all; and (5) if he doesn’t pav
the balance, he has by that time paid so much that
on the return of the goods, the dealer doesn’t stand
to lose much. So, one way and another, the bad
debts of a well-managed time-payment house are
smaller, as a rule, than they are with a house which
gives credit to motor-car customers and the like
When the motor-car customer doesn’t pay, the trades-
man mostly gets nothing at all, and loses his goods
Not for that tradesman the joy of getting half-pay-
ment and the return of the goods into the bargain!

This is one of the cos. in the brewery combine, so it
no longer makes beer itself ; like the others, it handed
its business over to the Carlton and L T nited Brew-
eries, Ltd., and gave that amalgamation the right
to lease its premises and take over its plant. In
return it got stock in the new co. of a face value of
£102,500; and during the past year it exercised its
right to take another £5125 for cash in pref. shares.
Most of that £102,500 is goodwill; but to even
things up a bit this co. practically wrote the holding
down by £25,625, and at the same time wrote its
brewery premises down. What the tangible assets
are worth it would be very hard to say. If for any
reason or other the combine fell to pieces (though
it is hard to see why it should), this co.’s interest
in that business would shrink tremendously; on the
other hand, the co.’s brewery premises would pro-
bably be worth far more than they are now valued
at. Besides the interest in the combine and its own
old brewery, the co. has a large holding of pub
property ; but most of the latter has been bought
with borrowed money. This shows the position bet-

would reduce the net income from that source to
under £lOOO. Yet, in spite of that poor net yield,
some at least of-the property assets are clearly under-
valued in the books, and nearly every year a profit is
shown on sales.
As for the outlook, the combine (Carlton and
United Breweries, Ltd.) has evidently come to stay;
and, though Victorian pubs are gradually being re-
duced under the compensation scheme of 1906, there
is no large reduction in the State’s thirst. On the last
official figures available, Victoria still soaks up just
on 12 gallons of beer per head per annum —a gallons
month, which is pretty fair going, considering the
number of people who do no soaking whatever. As
for pub property, there were still on June 30 of this
year 787 hotels in Greater Melbourne, and 416 of
them were doomed under the 1906 Act; but the
compensation has been fixed, so that no pub should
now be overvalued in any brewery co.’s books. The
reductions may, of course, go beyond the number
fixed under the 1906 law ; for there is nothing to pre-
vent a new law when the present measure has com-
pleted its slaughter. At the same time, with only

A great mistake, when erecting new works or re-
arranging old ones, is often made in constructing the
building and installing machinery ere looking round
for means of transport of the raw material, half-
manufactured and finished goods. Messrs. Adolf
Bleichert and Co., of London, have issued various
catalogues and leaflets, illustrating and describing a
few of the many transport systems and plants which
they have supplied, and which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-
ploying such appliances. W. and J. Lempriere,
Melbourne and Sydney, are the Australian representa-
tives, and would be pleased to hear from those in-
terested. A specially trained engineer is retained to
consult and advise.*

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Hardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co. that grinding is not such a difficult
problem ; they have installed 64 of them, and say
“the Hardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of.” If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.
The Austral Ot;s Eng. Co., Ltd., of Melbourne, are
the sole representatives for them in the Common-
wealth, and will be glad to forward particulars.* [1

192 hotels closed out of the 663 that are to be
closed from first to last, the public begins to make
loud noises at every holiday season, complaining that
already hotel accommodation can’t be got ; and after

This has been a dreadfully mismanaged concern. In
the first place, if there had been anybody to pay the
excessive preliminary exes., business would not or at
any rate should not have been started at all, because
of 100,000 shares offered, no less than 68,575 were
not taken; and on those that were taken only a
few pence was paid. Then when the co. needed
capital and an attempt was made to force the calls
in, the dilatory shareholders stayed away from the
store. Which in a roundabout way reminds The
Bulletin of two neighboring publicans and sinners
it knew once. They were both good fellows and
good marks, and many a bob was cadged from them.
But gradually Brown’s trade increased while Smith’s
decreased. Then they swapped experiences, and
Smith discovered that, while he always “lent” the
bob, Brown was always careful never to lend any-
thing —he gave. It came to the same thing in the
long run, since the bobs were never paid back ; only
the man who “lent” the money never saw his cus-
tomer again—he turned into the other fellow’s bar.
Of 2800 shareholders on this co.’s register, 2000
were in arrears six months ago. Most of these
people held only three or four shares each. “After
exhausting every possible means to enforce pay-
ment,” 642 shares have lately been forfeited. That
is one part of the tale. The other part is that “in
our last report we predicted better results. Instead,
the sales have steadily decreased fully 25 p.c.” The
moral is: Never let a man owe you money that he
doesn’t like paying if you want him to come to your
store. How it is going to end Ti-ie Bulletin doesn’t
know. The co.’s capital is only £12,624, more than half
of which is lost or unrepresented by assets ; the co.’s
credit is probably not large (there is a small over-
draft, secured significantly by a mortgage debenture) ;
and, as the co. put nearly £2OOO of its mere hand:
ful of money into premises and fittings, the stock
isn’t large enough to be very attractive. No doubt,
if the real co-operators in the co. cut off all frill,
and for a start hired a small unpretentious store
(present rented premises run into £l4 a week), and
stocked a few lines well bought for cash, they would
save themselves in the aggregate a few hundreds of
pounds a year, and give the co. a chance of living.
But this paper isn’t very hopeful. At the half-
yearly meeting the shareholders certainly agreed to
write off the lost capital (ss. a share) ; but when it
was proposed to have three directors instead of five,
“no one voted for it.”

The inter-State coal trade from Newcastle
has been brisk, and shows a gain of 267,372 tons for
nine months, compared with a similar period in 1912.
The total value of coal exported was £1,982,071.
Unfavorable ocean freights have caused a falling-off
in the foreign trade to the extent of 100,616 tons ;
but, after all, it is the inter-State and Maoriland
trade that grows the fastest and pays the best.

Frank Powell’s Lambing Flat (N.S.W.)
venturing has been short and sweet. Boring proved
a gutter, but the width was narrow and the pluck
of the shareholders in the little Melbourne co. was
poor. So a liquidation div. of £5 goes back to the
shareholders, and a fee of £5O to the legal manager.
F. W. Cape, J. Woolcock and W. Cock,
the three mining engineers whom the Ardlethan
Options engaged to thoroughly sample and examine
the 1 co.’s options, have handed in their reports. “They
are unanimous,” the directors report, “that, though
the surface richness of the deposits on Dumbrell’s
Bygoo made it an attractive proposition, these veins
without exception having cut clean out within 40ft.
of the surface, the price asked for was not warranted
by development. Moreover, the bulk value of the
ore bagged was not nearly so high as we had been
led to believe.” Yet that was the best of the bunch.
The Lone Hand was too poor to pay, and in the ;
others the pipes Were small and the ore over-rated.
The only lease the cd. has hung on to is one near the
Carpathia (“where a large tonnage of high-grade
ore has been produced from pipes”). The block that
the co. has taken isn’t, it is admitted, very promis-
ing ; the milling ore raised isn’t good enough to send
away, and trenching has yielded nothing of value.
Stili it has position, and is at least an excuse for
hanging on to life in the vague hope that something
may turn up. This Ardlethan Options, by the way,
was Scantlebury’s co.—the same Scantleburv who
fired a writ into The Bulletin for saying before-
hand a few of those things about the field and its
“friends” that Scantleburv himself said with great
emphasis subsequently. Needless to say, The Bul-
letin hasn’t had the pleasure of meeting Scantlebury
in the courts. Perhaps he is sorry now that he spoke.
If so, he might at least give The Bulletin the
satisfaction of hearing him say it.
* f * *
Last week a nice little type-written circu-
lar was sent out officially by the manager of one of
the best-known Ardlethan cos. It inquired whether
the addressee still held his shares in the co., and if
he did would he please call round at the office?
When a call was made at the office it was put to the
caller very nicely that something might be done to
improve the price of the shares. Within a few
hours Pitt-street began to talk of a pool; and
though, judging by the number of those circulars
that have floated into The Bulletin office, a crowd
of those to whom they were addressed have no use
for them, the market, thinking the thing might
come off, doubled the price of the shares. That’s
the sort of “development” Ardlethan values depend
on nowadays.
Ivanhoe (W.A.) is again compelled to
reduce its average grade and tnus pare its profits.
Starting in January next, tne monthly surplus is to
be cut down to a. 10,000, or about half of what it
was three years ago. This reduction will necessitate
a shrinkage in the quarterly dividend to 3s. Mean-
time the co. is pushing down tte main shaft to test
geologist Maclaren s theory thar values may improve
again lower down. It is also bearing in mind the
same expert’s opinion that diamond-drilling to a
depth of 2000 ft. may reveal a new payable lode in
the Ivanhoe Junction and other leases on the western
fringe of the Hannan’s belt. The Ivanhoe acquired
these blocks on Maclaren’s tip some time ago and an-
nounced that it proposed to expend £lO,OOO on bor-
ing. On second thoughts, however, it got six
months’ exemption ; but some work will probably be
done before long.
* * * *
Golden Ridge (W.A.) also reduces its
monthly profit. This step is taken on account of the
accumulated residues having been treated; also the
average grade of the ore is nothing like it used to
be. lor the present the surplus is to be brought
down to £500; but judging by the appearance of
the mine workings, it may have to come lower than
that very soon.
* * * *
Ora Banda (W.A.) for a time basked in
the sunshine of Ministerial support. Then it starred
a bit on developments in the Victorious leases ; but
the State battery soon found out its weak points,
and the throwing up of the Gimlet option by Lionel
Robinson and party made it feel very sick. Disap-
pointed, but not dismayed, some of the Adelaide pro-
moting gentry have now turned their attention to
Holden’s Find, near Ruby Well. Of this field The
Bulletin’s advices are not favorable so far; but final
judgment is reserved.
Lancefield (W.A.) got a winding-up
order in the Perth Supreme Court the other day.
The total indebtedness amounts to about £40,000,
but only the mortgagee will get anything out of the
estate. Inability to find a process capable of treat-
ing the ore at a profit is the chief reason assigned'
for giving up.
Whim Well (W.A.) informs shareholders
by circular issued in London that everything in
the Murex treatment works is lovely. Recovery at
present averages something under 80 p.c. of the cop-
per, but this is expected to be improved upon.
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) has adopted
the bad policy of paying dividends before getting
out of debt. The co. began the current year with a
credit balance of £35,000 and has put by approxi-
mately the same amount since. Yet, although it still
owes the best part of £lOO,OOO, it coolly proposes
to make a 4s. distribution, absorbing with income
taxes £63,000, on October 30. This will leave
practically nothing in hand and a heavy debt to
debenture holders. Of course the div. has been de-
clared to worry the bears, and by way of giving them
an extra shake the. official announcement is made
that Vthe outlook at depth is extremely good.” But
that, .does not furnish the board with a legitimate
excuse for paying away money which ought to go
towards the liquidation of a debt bearing interest
at 6 p.c.
Luptons (W.A.) has decided to wind up
and is auctioning its effects. The Bulletin never
could see any other end for it.
* * * •
Efforts are being made to boom Randall’s
(W.A.), and before long Eastern capital may
be invited to come in. This district’s lodes
and other gold-bearing formations were never any-
thing more than short shoots pitching very flat to the
south. High values were and may still be obtained
in portions of these shoots, but if all the ore between
the walls is bulked it is doubtful if the average
would cover working costs. Several attempts have
been made by the old Santa Claus Co. and others
to make a do of things, but all have failed, and, as
usual, the blame has been thrown on the State mill.
That battery, however, was good enough to get the
gold if it was in the ore; but it wasn’t. Arsenical
pyrites are met with in depth, and that has been
another source of serious trouble. Some parts of the
district might pay if worked on pick-and-choose lines
by small parties of practical men, but cos. would
be well advised to stand clear. Stories are told about
hundreds of thousands of tons of haif-ounce ore being
in sight, and shoots of ore thousands of feet in
length ; but these riches exist only in the imagination
of the authors.
Great Fingall’s internal shaft is now
nearly finished, and haulage from the deep workings
below No. 13 level should be in full swing by the
beginning of November. Values continue to keep
up fairly well round about the 17th and 18th levels,
and a lot of payable ore of higher average grade
than present mill returns is now blocked out in this
part of the mine. The co. is still good for occasional
dividends.
Great Boulder is running the sampling
pick over the Big Bell, near Cue, and expects to have
some idea of the show’s worth by the end of the
month. Meantime the itinerant option-seeker has
appeared on the scene, and is tickling Adelaide ears
with yarns about the prospective value of surround-
ing blocks.
* * * *
Yuanmi (W.A.) has been obliged on
account of hard ground and scarcity of machine men
to curtail development. Plenty of ore is, however,
available to draw upon for a while. Though troubled
at first with minor metallurgical difficulties, the new
sulphide process is now reported to be “giving satis-
faction.”
Lake View and Oroya (W.A.) attributes
last month’s poor showing at Queen of the Hills to a
break-down of the power plant. This month's re-
turn should be normal.
For the last two months Oroya Links’
working costs have been little more than 155., which
is a remarkably low figure, considering the class of
ore dealt with and the depths from which it is
mined, and provided no costs have been suppressed.
The co.’s hopes are mainly centred on the Eclipse and
Croesus Prop, leases, where preparations are being
made to open up a fine body revealed some time ago
in a crosscut off one of the No. 7 level winzes.
“Rangan” : Mount Morgan is by no means
free from the settlements of ore that killed so many
men a few years ago. The hilltop has been so
honeycombed that, in spite of square-set timbering,
big lumps of the earth frequently shake themselves
into more comfortable positions. Fortunately the
“talking” of the timber generally gives ample notice
of a strain, and the men never wait for what fol-
lows. Within the last month or so three falls have
taken place. First about 200 tons “let go,” then
about 900 tons, and finally the biggest lot of the
three. But as the neighborhood is dangerous this
last movement hasn’t been explored. One notable
thing about it was the action of shift-foreman John
Williams in travelling through a ladder-way in the
stope in which the earth was moving in order to
make certain that all the men were out.
The Mariner Mineral Co. is having a go
at the Eleanora, on Langmorn station, 17 miles from
Marmor and five miles from the Queensland North
Coast railway. Thirty years ago a trench was opened
on this property and a shaft sunk ; but somehow
Thomas Creed, who owned the freehold, wasn’t satis-
fied with the cut he got out of the proceeds (mostly
his cut was nil), and at the first chance he drove
the miners off and kept them off for nearly 30 years.
Six days before the old man died, at the age of 86,
J. P. Mitchell, chairman of the Marmor, got him
to take a kindlier view of mining men, and went
away with the mineral rights in his pockets. The
Marmor Co., guided by J. M. Newman, started a
shaft in virgin country, and from development work
sent away 226 tons of ore worth about 13£ p.c.
copper, lldwt. gold and 6oz. silver —picked stuff, of
course. Since May no ore has been sent away, but
there is a fair tonnage broken and exposed, ready for
the hoped-for smelter. The lode formations run up
to 14ft. in width. The Government has now granted
the co. an aid of £6OO to put the shaft down another
100 ft. and open out at that level; and if there is
nothing yet showing to whoop about, there is at least
enough on which to build the hope that this mine, and
perhaps others, will put pounds into the miners’
pockets and shillings into the owners’.
At Charters Towers the Papuan Bril-
liant and Victoria’s crushing of 283 tons for £2230
was quickly followed by a 3d. dividend ( £1200).
The feature of recent development has been the loca-
tion of a cross reef at right angles to the Moonstone ;
this was met with while running a drive in search
of a dislocated section of the Moonstone at No. 4
N.E. level. As prospects are fair, Papuan shares
have picked up on the local market, and are now
more popular than the New Queen Cross next door.
The Cross, however, is developing No. 3 level to
some advantage.
* r- ■» <
Kelly’s Queen Block. Charters Towers,
has been pretty constant with its penny calls, so the
nicely-worded report has failed to attract buyers
at more than a humble copper or two. But there may
be something in the wind ; the crushing now going
through is reported to be looking very well, and
contributing shareholders might as well wait to see
what it amounts to.
* * * *
The Mammoth (N.Q.) smelted 456 tons
in six days for 130 tons of matte containing 40
tons copper, 1950 z. silver and 70oz. gold. The average
extraction is 8.7 p.c. copper, with approximately 12s.
worth of silver and gold. Total money value (copper
at £75), £7 2s. per ton of ore. If this high aver-
age can be maintained, profits should be substantial.
The matte is being sent to Chillagoe, and road
transport (about 20 miles to Mungana) is rather
expensive; but Mount Molloy paid dividends under
similar conditions.
The Mareeba (N.Q.) co., formed a few
months back to re-open the old Minnie Moxham, thinks
it has enough stone exposed already to justify a 10-
head battery; and 16,000 reserved shares (55.) are
being offered to provide the £3OOO or so which the
plant and water supply will run away with. If
favorable opinions could sweeten up stone as well as
shareholders, the mill would soon be belting out
dividends.

George Bryant’s report on the Cathcart,
Ararat (Vic.), will stimulate the fight over the old
bones of that show. The capacity of its drives to
unexpectedly jump from poor ground into 2oz. dirt
is bewildering those who like to speculate over
natural phenomena. For a lead to give 4190 z. from
2790 fathoms ; for it to have 2248 fathoms to come
and go on near Nos. 3, 5 and 6 rises ; and for it to
have a slab of ground still undeveloped north towards
the old No. 2 workings speaks more of a prosperous
old age than an early death in the gutter. The
mystery why, when the Cathcart Central could get
gold from the boundary onward, the Cathcart eouldri’t
get a decent prospect alongside, now seems to be
settled, as it is whispered that 2oz. dirt lies inside
the Cathcart boundary. To the man who bought at
255. and had to sell out at 65., it is written: “Opera-
tions in this part of the claim are expected to affect
the estimate of ground given for extraction in other
parts of the mine.” Cutting out this “probable”
bunk of the gutter at the south end, 2248 fathoms
of 30dwt. will give 33720 z. gold. As costs ought
not to be more than 15dwt. per fathom, seeing the
amount of dead work that has been done, profits
of £6750 ought to be won, apart from “probable”
results.
Record of the Duke and Main Leads Con-
sols, Maryborough (Vie.), for the last half-year:
5143 fathoms panelled; expenditure, £11,942. That
of the Cathcart, Ararat: 2790 fathoms panelled;
expenditure £10,816. Still, in the face of its
cheaper costs, the Duke Consols didn’t do more than
keep the wolf from the door. The average value of
the wash was a shade under 48s. per fathom, while
costs ran into 465. Yields came down because the
co. had to abandon 2000 ft. of the gutter in the
north end worth only 7dwt. As dirt like that cannot
be handled profitably, the staff had to be shortened
and development hastened. As often happens, a
double-barrelled improvement is reported for the
last 500 ft. of the gutter in both ends of the mine.
The co. has over 7000 ft. of the gutter to work. So
if it hasn’t a big cash balance it has plenty of
ground to find cash for. To those who like such
studies the following analysis tells where the money
goes in an alluvial mine:—
Wages .. . . ~ .. .. 67.5 per cent.
Fuel 6.9
Props and laths . . .. .. 4.7 ~
Timber and stores .. .. .. 5.3 ~
Royalty .. .. .. . . 2.0 „
Dividends .. .. .. . . 9.4 ~
Rents, management, etc. . . . . 4.2 ~
The div. return wasn’t earned, but was possible
because of the carry-over from the previous half-
year. This record shows that lldwt. dirt in a big
alluvial mine is the dead limit for profitable work
—a fact that led to the downfall of 8., M. & Co.’s
alluvial venturing in Victoria.
The Age has given an immoderate puff
to the Mount Lyell’s Comstock mine, asserting that
the acquisition of that claim is “the best and most
important deal in the history of the field.” The
reason is alleged to be that the shoots of ore from
the North Lyell have crossed the boundary at 850 ft.,
while at 1000 ft. and 1100 ft. they are only 50ft.
distant from the Comstock. There must, however,
have been a vast increase in the pitch of the shoots
of ore in the North Lyell mine for the Comstock to
have got the ore. The last plans issued by the Lyell
co. certainly don’t show up such a prospect, nor does
that very good barometer, the share market, hint at
such a thing. Nor have Lyell Blocks stopped their
shaft, which is to pick up the shoots on their under-
lie.
The new Kampong Kamunting Co. has
let the contract for its two dredges to Ruwolt, in
Melbourne. The machines will be easily the biggest
ever made in Australia- —and on Malayan experience
Australia knows more about dredge-building than
any other country in the world, and has done as
much of it. One dredge is to be ready in eight
months: the other in 11. The cost, including spare
parts and buildings, will be over £40,000. The
Austral-Malay prospecting syndicate, which floated
the Kampong, has exercised its option over a 170-
acre property, averaging lib., at Taiping, and the
Larut Tin Dredging Co. is to be formed to equip
and work it. Of three other properties under option,
two have been turned down on T. W. Horton’s boring
tests.
Tongkah Compound has tacked on another
16 acres of ground, presumably the result of Pea-
cock’s mission to Siam. The new ground bores ljlb.
tin oxide. This, though only about half that of the
old Compound area, is distinctly payable, as Com-
pound's costs keep close to sd. Another Is. div. and
Is. bdnus tall into the pouch of the Compound share-
holders on November 14, making their little total
375. per 20s. share, or £92,500 in all. And the co.
is still only about five years old.
North Australian Exploration has taken a
nine months’ option over dredging areas on the Mowai
River, Woodlark Island, and is to give the Guinea
Gold Syndicate one-fifth paid interest in the co. and
£3OOO from profits on gold won. The area has been
reported on by Clark and Hungerford, and covers
what is reckoned the best of the old diggings of
Busai and Karavakoom. The Guinea Gold Syndicate
has also secured aieas on the Gira and the Yodda ;
and Papua generally is in for dredging activity.

The Cornwall Tailings Co. (Eng.), which
is partly engineered by Australian metallurgists, is
making poor recoveries from a million-ton dump.
The tailings contain, at present prices, an average of
30s. worth of tin, but the net return last year, after
paying smelting costs, was only 10s. 3d. per ton,
out of which 4s. 7d. goes for purchase. As wet con-
centration loses more than 60 p.c. of the metal, it is
proposed to try chemical methods.


AN EPILEPTIC FIT.
A famous London physician, who for vears
made a study of this disease, has, after a number of
experiments, found a prescription which affords re-
lief in almost a marvellous manner. This has been
put on the market by Mr. I. W. Nicholl, Pharmaceu-
tical Chemist, of Belfast, under the name of
“Ozerine,” and the number of unsolicited testimonials
received speak well for its efficiency as a remedv
against this appalling disease. Your chemist can
easily get it for you.*
IT’S LIKE PLAYING HAMLET and leaving out
the Prince of Denmark to buy Penduplicate Books
not supplied with “Zanetic” Pen-copying paper. If
security is valued, and permanency of copy desired,
it is VITAL to be sure you are supplied with
“Zanetic.” Copies that fade are useless. “Zanetic”
paper ensures permanency of copy, whilst the latter
is denser and more distinct than the original. Of all

WOMAN'S
LITTER
Sydney, October 27, 1913.
My Dear Arini, —
The Kentuckians landed the biggest fish of
the season —in fact, a social whale —at their
dinner the other evening. This was the
guest of honor, Admiral Patey. The Ken-
tucky Club is so-called because each member
pays for herself. (That is said to be a
habit they have in the State that grew
Uncle Tom’s cabin. In Kansas, on the other
hand, they owe for the drinks.) After mem-
bers have put up the price of their own
meal, they pool the extra cash for distin-
guished persons, and angle in the most likely
waters for those rather .-"'ary fish. An
Admiral is their best catch to date. The
Australia hostel was the place. Decorations
were unusual. An Australian homestead (a
sort of potted grange) on a living area of
tablecloth was surrounded by fine wheat-
growing damask, and included everything a
bush selection ought to have except a rain-
fall and some stringy bark with which to
tie up its gates.
Mrs. Trefie dashed up to Gilgandra to open
a fair in aid of the Bush Brothers’ cashbox
the other day. She raced to town again in
time to put her feet up and take down her
back hair (an imposing mane of raven hue)
for a few hours before the Kentuckians’
evening out with our own Patey. The fair
smashed every local record —or tried to —
with £7O to the good.
Governor Strickland, shadowed by Aide
Talbot, opened the Women’s Handicrafts’
show last week. St. James’s Hall sheltered
the exhibits until Saturday evening, when
the unsold samples of women’s toil were
bundled off the premises, and the sold de-
parted in lumpy brown-paper parcels. Mrs.
Sansom’s leather work was the strong meat
of the show. Cleone Cracknell, who learnt
the craft in Paris, was ahead of competition
in some gorgeous samples of enamel work.
Ella Richards, and other exhibitors of China
painting, had attractive wares to sell. Mrs.
Munday possesses the potter’s thumb, which
she u@es vigorously in Australian clay. Busy
Mary Makinson was entrenched behind a
fortress of carved wood. Mrs. Anderson’s
bed-cabinet, a cute contrivance in fumed oak,
was exhibited at the Women’s Handicrafts'.
This ingenious patent would be a godsend
to G.-G. Denman during his hurried visits to
this city. With a Gentleman Help on sentry-
go, his Ex. could camp in a bed-cabinet o’
nights in Hyde Park. By day, if he stroked
it the right way, it would turn into a ward-
robe, a desk, a bookcase, cupboards for his
sword and cocked hat, and a mirror. The
bed-cabinet belonsrs to the hurried age, and
should be carefully inspected by Governors
on the wallaby.
Rose Day had hardly vanished into the
limbo of lost cash when Bird Day shook the
echoes of the Technical College. Chief Justice
Cullen held forth at this third annual chirrup
of the N.S.W. Gould League of Bird Lovers,
and quoted novelist Charles Reade’s eulogy
of the Australian thrush. The traveller
who once said in his haste that our flowers
had no scent and our birds no song was an
Ananias of the most brazen cheek. Obviously
She was so much cheek that he had no nose
and was blind in both ears. (Incidentally
lie said it of South Africa, and not of Aus-
tralia, but some traveller or unreliable per-
son shifted the statement.) Anyone who
has heard a magpie chorus gurgling up a
bush gully to meet the morning milk-cart
might easily take it for the original version
of a bird interlude in a Wagnerian orches-
tra.
The Gould League falls with a thud on
the hereditary instinct of the Boy to steal
birds’ nests. If he takes the anti-egg pledge,
however, it doesn’t include total abstinence.
He can still rob Mrs. Black Orpington, and
take a joyous part in another street collec-
tion. Evg Day, coming once a year,
looks a dubious speculation. No egg is eat-
able by white people when it is 12 months
old, though the Chinese sell, as great and
costly delicacies, the blackened hen-bomb
that was left over from the reign of George
IV. And, by way of a side issue, a frantic
short-story writer once perpetrated a tale of
a man who dug a huge egg out of the bottom
of an African swamp. He put it in the sun
to dry. and —it being an antediluvian egg—
it hatched a fowl that was partly ten lions
and partly three ostriches, and the fowl
chased him to the top of a tree, where he
lived in great discomfort for 17 years. But
this is a departure from the subject. No
ordinary or sane Egg Da/ lasts 17 years.
The Roval North Shore Hospital is still
opening its larder for more eggs. Last week
this egg-hunting institution got about 115
dozen, more or less, of poultry produce. As
this letter reaches you, its committee will be
counting up a fresh supply. No elderly eggs
will be considered eligible.
“The Midsummer Week’s Dream” is
going to be taken wide awake from Decem-
ber 2 to 6. This daymare will occur on
the Sydney Cricket Ground in aid of Will
Shakspeare’s Tercentenary party. Organis-
ing-sec. Grace Burrows (who is organising
so much that she’ll have to take to tabloid
meals instead of week-ending at Wagstaff
Point) is in charge of events.
Horticulture for women is so much in the
air just now that it occasionally descends
to earth in weird shapes. Some just-born
guild is chasing the Horticultural spade
with all its might (its might is at present
as stupendous as the battle-cry of one mos-
quito). It is alleged to have been respon-
sible for the “horticultural” section in the
recent Women’s Handicrafts show. If this
section, which was spread over about six
feet by eight of St. James’s Hall basement,
is the best the baby Guild can do, it ought
to swear off horticulture and buy its green
fodder from a Chinaman.
The Mary Ann problem is going to be
thrashed black and blue at a meeting on
November 12. The Millions or Billions
Club lurks behind this latest development of
the Help-less housewife’s wail. Mrs. Gor-
don Wesche is one of the aiders and abettors
of this scheme. The übiquitous Percy
Hunter has helped to sketch the skeleton
outline of a conspiracy to prepay the pas-
sages of British domestics to these shores.
Some kind of legal chain will have to be
gummed on to the emigrating goddesses of
the broom, however. Trusting housewives
might hand out £8 towards the passage of
a Treasure who wouldn’t stay in one billet
long enough to understand the kitchen
chimney.
“Snowy” Baker is mentioned as one of
the reckless persons who undertakes to be
a judge of Australian beauty. The J.C.W.
management is going to turn the climax of
its “Forty Thieves” panto into a beauty
show. The Australian girl in her most
shapely form will be culled from hundreds
of applicants. Last time Mr. Snowy Baker’s
serene smile was mislaid for a few weeks
was the occasion of a Venus competition.
Some of the Venuses had arms like working
blacksmiths. They couldn’t all get first prize.
Some of them wanted to know why (if pos-
sible in mortal combat) they didn’t get first
prize, or even more. Organiser Baker was
reported to be in hiding behind his own tele-
phone while wrathful Venuses inquired if he
were at home.. I understood he would in
future ask a fee of one million pounds to
say that one girl was better looking than
another. Still —he’s looking for beauties
and trouble all over again.
Mrs. Gertrude Innes-Noad has fallen with
some slaughter on the scribe who dared to
draw up a summary of events for the Twi-
light Home. As Hon. Sec, of the Home,
which is rather nearer to earth than Wal-
halla in its present indefinite shape, the large
sister of Bruce Smith, M.P., has some right
to poke her pen into suggestions which were
as practical as a house of pie-crust. “Home,”
says the astounded Mrs. Gertrude, in a
letter to the press, “wants a little suite
where convenience and utility must be
studied and beauty not lost sight of (etc.)
for six or eight ladies, with a working house-
keeper (first class) to be obtained and
maintained on funds from the said six or
eight tenants, amounting to a total of £2 Bs.
a week” (etc.). Mrs. Noad doesn’t know
how the domestic millennium is going to be
achieved this side of starvation. The Twi-
light Home still trembles on the horizon
from lack of funds, and its committee wants
cash, not froth, to build or rent a house
which won’t waltz into the bankruptcv court
when its gasbills come in.
Mr. Henry Gullet and daughter Minnie
have tripped off to the Apple Isle for a few
weeks.
Tea-planter C. J. Speer, one of Ceylon’s
rising young men, is combining business and
pleasure in a holiday saunter round about
here. Sydney is growing into a frequent
habit with some of Colombo’s most expen-
sive people. You can bounce into tea or
rubber any fine summer morning in a Manly
breaker. Tea, by the way, seems to be a
safer product (to be very rising in) than
rubber. In the former, Sahib Golden Tips,
if he has some luck and tumbles out of bed
in the dawning, can catch a small fortune
before he gets the devilled liver feeling. In
rubber, the rise is likely to go off pop with
a sudden puncture in prices, as evidenced by
the present flopped condition of that wobbly
commodity.
The A. C. Lavingtons, of Ceylon, hurried
off to Maoriland in the Niagara after a
brief stay in this township. Mrs. Lavington
used to be a Miss Blundell, of Wellington
(M.L.). Her people pursue the inky way
by controlling the thunder of the Evening
Post.
Papua has been whispering in the ear of
one G. A. Scott, a son of the late Admiral
Scott, and an ex-Anglo-Indian. He planted
rubber and cocoanut in India’s colored
strand for 30 years or so, before settling
down in Westralia about two dozen months
ago. A sudden competence blew in from
somewhere, and he decided to personally
conduct a Scott expedition through the
cocoanut and rubber jungles of Papua. Mr.
Scott picked up a partner, and the two left
Sydney with supplies for the mosquito king-
dom beyond PiM't Moresby. Just here the
partner changed his mind or his plans so
swiftly that he forgot to notify the astounded
Scott," who had to lead the busy—it might
almost be said the crowded —life till lie could
tap his bank account. In spite of this very
bumpy beginning, the enterprising Scott,
whose opinion is worth 30 years’ experience,
considers Papua a good place to get into
the rubber and cocoanut business. But he
is not looking for another partner, if that
jade Rumor can be believed for once. He
finds partners too sudden and variable.
Roycroft Library, where the amiable Miss
Peacock presides, sends “Peter Piper” this
way. It is written by Doris Egerton Jones,
of South Australia, and is published by
Cassell’s. Miss Jones, 8.A., is the clever
young woman who wanted to join the Devil’s
brigade—l mean practise law —in Adelaide.
She went down on her bended frock (or
thereabouts) to implore the Supreme Court
in the Holy City to allow her to put on a
horsehair wig and gown. But the Supreme
Court wasn’t taking the responsibility of
chaperoning young lady lawyers. The girl
then appealed to Parliament, which was
(presumably) so dazed by her persistence
that it took the line of least resistance. A
Bill, graciously permitting women to be
eligible for admission to the Bar (the legal
Bar, of course) in S. Australia fought its
way through the political haze which usually
obscures a clean-cut case. Now Doris. B.A.
has plunged into literature. Though “Peter
Piper” is obviously a first attempt, it is
more piquant and readable than the mature
solids of duller minds. The hero is a Her-
cules with the face of a Greek god. Miss
Jones will outlive this kind of hero very
quickly. Hercules tosses his yellow mane
through 342 pages of Peter Piper’s love
story. The Greek god is such an ordinary
cad in his dealing with a simple flapper of
17 summers that he ought to have been
kicked all the way from Sparta to Thebes
with a special kicking in Attica by Miss
Peter’s very casual male parent. He re-
vokes his caddism later on. but the writer
will probably hand us something that doesn’t
bound so much in her next novel.
A deluge of tea parties is washing over
these shores. Miss Marshall, a daughter of
medico George Marshall, of Darling Point,
was farewelled in the great tannin tidal
wave the other day. She is going to wed
Dr. Moore, who amputates in Hobart.
The bridal present item which is so fresh
that it can’t be told in cold print has a
nasty way of going stale when the printer’s
devil has slept on it. Three weeks ago a
reliable rumor that bride-elect Mabel Pres-
ton (whose wedding occurs before this
reaches you) was having her nice appear-
ance painted by Florence Rod way, floated up
the office stairs. The miniature is to fit
into the gold cigarette case the lucky ’groom,
Roy King, gets as a present from his bride.
I hung on to that crumb of news and locked
it up in the office bread-basket, by request,
so that the ’groom wouldn’t be clamoring for
the picture three weeks before the wedding
morn. The Inky Imp purloined the old
original “going to be married in two or three
weeks, etc.,” news, and sent it along to you
last mail. Now, I’m waiting to purloin the
Imp’s scalp.
The handsome Vera Connell is going to say
“I will” to Russell Rowe on or about Nov. i.
The girl belongs to the King-Marks family,
which once stuck its roots under the shade of
Illawarra’s cabbage-tree palms. She’s a niece
of George Fuller, ex-member for that dairy-
district in the House of Reps. Vera’s
mother and her auntie Fuller have both been
noticeable for their good looks.
Mrs. Bruce Nicoll, an Australian who
recently quenched the wander thirst in con-
tinental travel, is going to lift up her soprano
voice in concert or operatic trills here under
the name of Nicollini. The Voice was
trained in the way it should go by J. Court-
land Cooper and Trangott Ochs, of the Ochs-
Eichelberg Conservatorium, in Berlin. This
nomenclature sounds as if it ought to be
heavily loaded with Wagner.
Will Samuell, who made such a stir as
the father of Louise in Charpentier’s opera,
is a carpenter by trade. He was born in
Swansea, South Wales, and went on ham-
mering nails for quite a while after his fine
baritone voice arrived. As a sideline, young
Chips began to win Eisteddfod competitions
at a record pace, and knocked out competi-
tion by making his century in first prizes.
Later, he took up the song-bird business
seriously and became a starter in the Royal
Academy of Music. Here he continued his
swift career as a student who was always
in front. He won a stack of trophies, in
his kit he packed away the silver and bronze
medals, the R.A.M. certificate, the Goldberg
Prize and the Betzman Gold medal for opera.
If every Welshman is a miner, singer,
draper or preacher, Samuell adds another
profession. He is a fine actor, with an in-
tensely dramatic sense of song. I fancy he
gets a good start from some picturesque
Hebrew squatter on the Plains of Abraham
who migrated to Wales when f ree selection
became too prevalent. (Uon
After many false alarms and several sem-
obituary notices, Australian sculptress n

The Henniker Heaton dame beamed under a
canopy of greenish-blue plumes. Penny Post
Henniker, who has parted with about half
a yard of his beard since he returned to
N.S.W., loomed in the centre of the crush
like a tall pillar-box. He hints at pulline
down the cable toll before he hands in hr
resignation. The McMillan lady tossed a
honeyed greeting at the departing Dora, and
Mrs. German Consul Killiani, added a Teu-
tonic postscript. Archdeacon d’Arcy Irvine
contributed his best gaiters to the occasion
Mrs. Ronald Forbes, in a meek blue frock

she lingers in that stairy eyrie, the Queen's
Club. George Earp, M.L.C., and a bright-
eyed young daughter helped Mrs. George to
squeeze the visitors into the right niche.
Manager Freddie Shipman drops in with
a line re tenor Dufault. The best financial
streak in the Nordica concert tour occured in
Maoriland. In Christchurch, city of spires
and bicycles, the authorities stopped the
sale of tickets some time before the perform-
ance began, owing to the audience threaten-
ing to grow several sizes too large for the
hall. Shipman has impounded Paul Dufault
for a comprehensive tour of Australasia.
Our National Gallery has taken to itself
Phillips Fox’s beautiful oiled flicker of light
and shade called “Motherhood.” The young-
est belle in the group (mother and two chil-
dren) is an infant niece of the artist.
According to her fond uncle, this smali
beauty is quite as lovely as she’s painted.
This picture was hung in the Roval Acad-
emy, 1908 ; Paris Salori, 1910. Its catalogue
value is 300 guineas, and it earns every
copper.
The Quinlan co.’s production of “Faust”
gave us a Marguerite (Felice Dyne) with a
20in. waist and the sweet chirrup of a pet
canary. She hopped about the stage like the
same agile warbler when it goes after a lump
of sugar. Felice hasn’t outlived her flapper-
hood long enough to walk when she can run.
She skipped round her stout Faust (Maurice
D’Oisly) like a butterfly flirting with a
Lord Mayor. Basso Profundo William
Anderson dressed his form as Mephisto in
geranium red, with flame-colored millinery
of the Marie Stuart period. A long, lean,
wicked-looking feather in the Devil’s close-
fitting cai> was a fac-simile of the plume
which was so prevalent in race week. No
wonder his Anglican Legs has been talking
about our clothes as if they were sartorial
imps of Satan !
“Faust.” which began at 7.45 or there-
abouts, didn’t drag the Wagner enthusiasts
out of their secret hiding places, though it
filled the theatre. The hungry expression
noted while the 6.45 p.m. audience fell into
its seats was missing on Saturday night. The
osprey showed its fluff in the stalls, and a
huge green mount must have infuriated the
person who had paid 10s. 6d. to sit behind it.
The front rows of the stalls had a cow-like
pppearance owing to the presence of several
fat women in very ddcollete undress. The
early Victorian revival of hair gummed down
on the cheeks adds to this bovine expression,
and ought to be used with care.
“The Twilight of the Gods” was a majestic
pursuit of the Curse (I suppose that’s why
it’s called “Gotterdammerung”) which made
Society writhe into its places at 6.45 p.m.
Siegfried (Francis Costa) sparkled in sil-
very fish-scale armor like the Principal Boy
in pantomime. Brunnhilde had to sing over-
time in a garment that looked like a bath
sheet cut square at the neck. The end of
Walhalla is a bad bush fire, and the flop of
Brunhikle’s drapery as she dives into the
Rhine.
One of the best preservations in this State
is the old mill built by Thomas Rose in 1836.
This veteran can still shake an arm or a
leg in the wind, about a mile from the main
road between Campbelltown and Appin. It
stands on the hill which was in the long ago
christened Mount Gilead. Mat Harris,
M. now owns the mount and the mill
which used to belong, I think, to the V ood-
house family. Syd Ure Smith recently chased
this relic for its portrait. The result is a
hand-colored memory of the bad old days in
N. which ought to attract the gaze of
delvers in the pact.
Yours affectionately,
VANDOHLAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, October 27, 1913.
My Dear Yarrie,—
The Encounter will be guarding Melbourne
during the Cup revels. By way of thanks-
giving, the captain and officers have invited
everybody to a dance on board, at 9 o’clock
on Friday, November 7. The accomplished
Geoff. Stuart, who is recognised as the lead-
ing exponent of ragtiming, is dance-secretary,
so the programme should be quite satisfac-
tory. The marine hosts particularly want
guests to note that the cruiser will be along-
side the Town Pier, at Port Melbourne. Nice
and bumpy for motors, that pier, but ever so
much better than any shaky launch.
The Naval and Military Club has issued
invitations to a Cup dance. The valuable
documents (for as such they are regarded)
are being treasured by the lucky girls who
have received them. The naval men, though
they are tired, can dance like fury, and the
military men are, and always have been,
“dears.” God bless them !
The Denman Cup dance is programmed
for Wednesday, November 5. By that time
the chief horse scramble will have been de-
cided and everybody will know the worst.
An informal afternoon tea happened at
Federal Government House, on Thursday,
when the Denman lady gathered the
Y.W.C.A. delegates about her. Motors cut
round to the portico door, and two of the
largest footmen were told off to usher in the
guests thus delivered. The beautiful plush
creatures unconsciously took on quite a
churchwarden air of solemnity, though the
delegates wore just as many fine feathers as
the average collection of wordlings. They
hailed from all parts. The Fairfax dame,
who had come across with her daughter from
Sydney, was on hand; while Mrs.
Gladding, in a wine-colored dress and
chinchilla furs, helped to represent New
York. She is doing a world-tour,
and just happened to drop into Mel-
bourne in time for the function. The
Y.W.C.A. in the United States is a very up-
to-date institution, with women’s hotels in
every big centre. Any woman who is travel-
ling alone can put up at one of these com-
fortable places and still be considered in the
running, from a snobbish point of view. Mrs.
Willie Sharp, of Melbourne, has Mrs. Glad-
ding in tow. Miss Barnes, of New York,
als« attended in a businesslike hat; and a
businesslike hat at a highly-feathered tea-
par*v is always supposed to indicate that
the wearer is dead in earnest and not to be
put off on any acount. The hard-working
Miss Barnes has been stirring up this city
for several months. Mrs. Harper buzzed
about in the centre of the rally, which oc-
curred in a tapestry-hung drawing-room
which looks on to a terrace garden. Chamber-
lain Nevill, hovering massively in the door-
wav, took over the guests from the footmen,
discovered their names, and passed them on
to her Ex., who looked a cool and dainty
circumstance in a cinnamon-colored sheath
ruffled in white. Captain Pollok skirmished
on the outskirts of the flock. Some white-
clad feminines (violinist Gertrude Summer-
hayes. was amongst them) lurked dimly in a
curtained embrasure and supplied music.
Tea was poured in the State dining-hall.
Thither the chatterers drifted, and, after
being properly fed, were packed into home-
ward-bound motors just at sunset.
The sun blazed down on Henley and
brought out all the ribbon and lace in Mel-
bourne, as well as a mass of pig’s-face blos-
som on the rugs of vegetation that drape the
river avenue. Henley is a futile sort of
occasion ; but it is an outlet for the carnival
spirit, of which there appears to be a larger
bulk stock every year. The carnival spirit
drives the immature office youth to wear hat-
band, cummerbund, tie and socks of the same
vivid color, and go on like the fool he is. On
most other occasions he manages to conceal
his natural aptitude for being a highly-col-
ored ass.. At the earliest and dreariest hour of
the business morning, early girls were wait-
ing beneath the station clocks, wearing ridic-
ulous paper hats like lamp-shades, and an air
of forced gaiety, also shoes. When the long
afternoon really commenced, the still heat of
the low river banks baked out the high
spirits of the youngest and most idiotic ; but
at night the grateful coolness of the air.
the soaring rockets, the dancing lanterns and
all the rest of it revived fainting Folly and
gave Plain Idiocy a fresh start. Then the
colored ass of the afternoon was mercifully
obscured, and the girl with the paper hat
felt glad that at last no one could see it.
The half-crowners did not have the best of
the racing. Thev were on the flat in a hot
and restless herd: conseouently, they only
got occasional glimpses of the racing craft
between the houseboats. In the houseboats
themselves, only the fattest and most per-
sistent got the fr rnt seats. Uninvited
minxes and others climbed the grassy cliffs
towards Government House, and viewed the
madness from afar. The Gaud Mayor sup-
ported a small straw boater and commanded
the flagpunt. G.-G. Denman turned up with
white spats on his. feet, which looked un-
necessarily hot. His dame stayed indoors
with a headache, and watched the bright
show from a cool corner of her own grey
housetop. She has a fine array of feminine
aides now to help her out. Mrs. Pearson acted
as her representative on Saturday, and
visited the Gaud Mayor’s drain-cruiser,
accompanied by Chamberlain Nevill. She
aroused the interest of the hot and flustered
feminine crowd with her dress of cool, white
muslin edged with fur —the very latest dress
idea. Pie Commissioner Reid waddled hap-
pily down the green baize gangway; his tie
was a real Henley blue and his suit a fes-
tive grey sac. His dame looked about 28
years young in a white muslin with
an orange sash. Daughter Thelma romped
round tlie boat until she discovered the ice-
cream department. Mrs. Hennessy had
orange-tinted stencilling on white towelling
for a frock. Leonie Peterson-Mackworth,
just back from her honeymoon, wore a
poster-striped blue and white frock, and
promenaded with her tall husband. Help
Barttelot and Secretary Wilberforce strolled
with them. Mrs. Fairbairn was attached
all day to her own housepunt.
A conspicuous feature of Henley was the
enamelled flapper. Youngsters were pow-
dered and rouged till they looked like circus
clowns. Every “smart” flapper nowadays
seems to be a competent painter and deco-
rator.
One of Australia’s best-known champion
sports, who plays the game in England nowa-
days, is said to have been engaged to the
daughter of a Jewish multi-millionaire, with
papa’s consent. Papa was understood to
favor the match more or less. At any rate
he scornfully rejected the application of a
smart London stockbroker who asked leave
to pay his addresses to the lady. Time went
on and the stockbroker renewed his applica-
tion and was turned down a second time.
“Oh, well,” said he to the angry father, “you
needn’t get excited; we’ve been married
three months.” The Australian seemingly
had been too absorbed in his game to attend
t the important matrimonial business.
Mrs. Ledingham is off to Maoriland this
week, after some hard-fought battles for
charity. The energetic lady, having helped
all the human institutions she can think of,
is now planning a bazaar for the benefit of
lost dogs. By the way, I can’t remember if
there ever was a bazaar in aid of lost cows
or cats. Presumably the cow is never lost
and the cat always remembers the way
home. Then it can always climb a fence or
a tree when danger threatens.
At'the Wiseman-Syme weddiuv. on Octo-
ber 23, uncle George Reid drank the bride’s
health in barley water! The act is of vast
historical importance. The bride was his
niece, Marion Elizabeth York Syme, daugh-
ter of shipping-man York Syme and his lady,
who is the sister and image of the High
Commissioner. The knotting happened at
the Scotch kirk at Canterbury, and the bar-
ley-water incident was “staged” in a large
marquee at Tour Mont, the York Svme home.
Reid certainly is slimmer than of old, and
has lost quite five of his chins. Perhaps the
barlej 7 water is responsible for the shrinkage.
He looks almost youthful and very well. His
dame was as slim as a fashion-plate in a
startling sheath gown of shiny pink-purple.
It was cut very low, and the little black
hat that went with it was decorated with
an osprey like a burst watermain.
Society attended in battalions. One
just-returned female, full to the neck
with useless knowledge, murmured in-
formatively to a friend: “You know, dear,
nothing is considered really smart in Eng-
land unless there is a fearful crush.” The
weather was of the right sunny-blue brand
prayed for on outdoor occasions like wed-
dings and garden-parties. Mrs. York Syme,
in blue and clasping blue larkspur to her
bosom, welcomed the guests effusively, and
presented them with the freedom of the
whole house. Her husband also adorned the
head of the stairs. He is a quiet man of im-
pressive appearance, who is generally up to
his eyes in shipping business down town,
and is., consequently, rarely seen, even at
vanishing time, by the frequenters of his
wife’s parties. Quite a lot of the guests
looked at him with interest; he was a new
exhibit to them. The bride and bridegroom
received congratulations in a fortified corner
of the hall. Her head was visible above a
lot of lovely Limerick lace, while the new
husband’s tie was seen to match his mous-
tache exactly. These slight details could be
noted even when the crush w"- at its worst.
Then the presents were looked at. A maid
held, the door against the stream of guests,
while a couple of watchful groomsmen regu-
lated the traffic at the far door of exit. A
sister bridesmaid had pink roses on her dress
and a layer of chiffon over that. Mr. Miller (I
think he is captain of a bank, or something)
showed his curly head in the throng. Robert
Best and his wife had only to get through a
hole in the hedge from round the corner
(that looks involved, doesn’t it?), and the
Tom Hogans (Mrs. Tom in a dream of a
trench mustard dress) cut across tbmr
neighboring place that finishes at the White
Horse-road. Mrs. Agar Wynne and Mrs.
Ledingham motored on from the Herbert
Sarffood party. The Gaud Mayor’s hat had
a high nolish,. and heliogranhed congratula-
tions. while his dame smiled in grey. Mrs.
Colonel Selheim was a slender fmnre in white
cloth. Mrs. Elkington seemed nroud of her
fine feathers, and prouder of the fact that
she had oantured a whole afternoon of her
busy husband’s time. Mia Mia girls, in
cherry-colored dresses, seemed cheered by the
honor of being chosen to spread food for the
High Connoisseur.
An elaborate wedding card is now posting
through the land bidding folk to the mar-
riage of Elizabeth, the second Pinschof
daughter. She is to assume the ring of
Mr. Walter Moore Finley, on Monday,
November 17, at St. Paul’s, and admission
to the tabernacle will be by card only. The
usual food will be spread at Studley Hall,
the Pinschof domicile.
The Creswell dame, heavily gowned . in
black, came out of her mourning seclusion,
last week, to flit about the town and have
lunch with the King-Hall dame, while their
respective husbands were engaged at farewell
functions. Later on, the Creswell dame went
down to the sea and waved last good-byes to
the voyagers.
Consul Magelssen and his wife are look-
ing after the Panama Commissioners. Alva
Adams, of Pueblo, ex-Governor of Colorado,
who leads the band, is a typical Western
American, and a great favorite with all the
men who have taken refreshments with him.
Strong tea is raging as a prelude to the
Cup-week frivols. Mrs. P.MG. Wynne,
aided and abetted by daughter Maud (the
Manser Major’s wife), contrived to squeeze
a few hundred women into the wide halls of
Halcyon, on the 27th. Mrs. Isaacs will pro-
vide tea and buns for all comers, at Cliveden
Mansions, on the 30th. The next notable
teapotting occurs on November 5, when
Vera Clarke Landale and her mother are to
preside.
The Marcel Conrans, who lived in Sydney
for years, have returned to Victoria and
taken a house on the Como Estate, which
is on the border of Toorak. They decided
against returning to Geelong, where they
abode for years. Thus is the course of his-
tory altered.
The Herbert Power family are seldom
without an invalid to look after. Daughter
Gladys is again on a sick bed, though she
was reported quite well some time ago.
Fat and beauteous Hal Cohen, who ceased
to decorate the Block two or three years
back, has made his fruity tenor heard to some
purpose in the Fog, and (as Harold Colonna)
has been engaged to warble the leading tenor
roles for the autumn season at Covent
Garden.
Mrs. Hugh Ward is over here for the race-
time frivols. She is staying at Mount levers
with the jolly tribe of Brenan sisters, of
whom there are eight. Alderman and Mrs.
Brenan are due to return from their Eng-
lish trip on November 9.
Jennie Brenan has got hold of a discreet
ballroom version of the Tango, and is teach-
ing it to a select assortment of social pupils
at the Dyce Murphy home. Miss Knatch-
bull-Hugessen and Mrs. Harold Pearson
motor along to study the Brenan version of
the dance, which has nine steps, and is quite
proper. A number of smart hostesses are
hurrying to have it included in their race-
week programmes. It is being done in polite
circles in England and elsewhere, and the
flappers here are practising tirelessly.
Tom Humphrey has been working hard
for a spell, and the result is a Centreway
studio full of pictures. Women have got
into the habit of dropping in for a few
minutes on their way to fashionable tea-
drinkings. Humphrey’s work is pleasantly
varied, but he seems to have a fancy for
one particular brand of moon. It spots
dozens of his canvases. In a tumultuous
thing called “The Wave,” a strip of lightning
takes the place of the pancake moon; but
the good old orb of night reappears redly
above a scrubby corner inhabited by a swag-
gie who is accumulating rheumatism for his
old age by sitting on a damp log. To balance
this, the versatile artist has painted a hot
summer beach full of sunlight, bathing chil-
dren, nurses and picnic refreshments.
Clewin Harcourt is an artistic Australian
who has spent most of his life out of Aus-
tralia. He returned eight or nine months
ago with his French polish thick upon him,
and has placed a picture here and there in
Melbourne shows. He has taken the ele-
vated Beasant Hall, from October 21 to the
end of. the month, and the reader who sees
this will still have time to visit an interest-
ing show, including pictures that have been
exhibited at the Royal Academy, Paris
Salon, Japan-British Exhibition and various
English provincial galleries. Anyone may
buy a reproduction of “June,” the R.A. pic-
ture.
Ethel Webb, who teaches gymnastics on
the lid of the tall Auditorium, asked her
friends to roof coffee, fresh air and fire-
works on Henley night. Her guests looked
down on the carnival lights and up the
stars, and the shrill chorus of admiration
almost drowned the top notes of John
McCormack, carolling in the concert-hall
below.
My Adelaide correspondent writes:—
Another week of social delirium has whirled madly
by. The revelry began on Saturday, when the Bony-
thons asked a number of ratepayers to tea at Victoria
Park. You have not seen what one may call genuine
social dementia till you have witnessed the spectacle
of an Adelaide ratepayer consuming a gift tea.
Mrs. Bonython revelled in a slimly-built black gar-
ment with a hint of softening white at the bodice and
a colored rose stuck in her belt. Amongst others pre-
sent were George Reid and his sons and daughter.
The Bosanquets arrived at four o’clock, she in cream
satin and lace, with vagrom touches of heliotrope,
and her daughters in biscuit color and grey
and blue respectively. Amongst those absent were
the Ways—-he is still recuperating at The Grange—-
and the entire Duncan clan —a matter of mourning.
Mrs. Albion Tolley had planned a garden party for
Tuesday—such is the infectiousness of the prodigal
life—but the rain came down like a ton of Assyrians
on an unusually unprotected fold, and the entertain-
ment had to be transformed into an ordinary tea-
fight. What had the Psalmist to say about the
weather’s habit of going on in this maddening
fashion? I forget for the moment, but I know it
was something extremely apposite in an objugatory
sense? To get back to business. Mrs. Tollev poured
out tea in white (A.D.C’d by a blue-clad daughter),
thus saving from death by Exhaustion, the daughter
of Famine, the Mayoress and her sister-in-law,
Mrs. Angas Parsons, the Josiah Symon lady, and one
of her daughters, Mrs. Arthur Rymill, Mrs. H. C.
Cave, Mrs. Kenneth Milne and Miss Russell, Mrs.
Downer, Mrs. W. A. Magarey and others.
John McCormack’s first concert attracted to the
Town Hall every Adelaidian who was not cynically
prepared to be branded for life as fit for treasons,
strategems and spoils. And there were a lot there
who liked the music for itself. Anyhow they yelled
and encored as though they did. On \tnna„

On Monday died H. D. Sutherland, manager n f u.
local branch of the National Bank. He was a°o

his early 30’s, and leaves a widow and three chiT

The Government House Garden Party on Pride,,
was about the last big affair the present vie/
regalities will give before they leave us for
ever. Lady Bosanquet wore white, with panels Z
black lace, and her daughters were in cool white
muslin. No frock was particularly startling, thonod,
there were some absorbing leg-shows when fljms ’
garments got into the glare of- the sun. Two thmi

Mr. Delehanty is still worried to death on thp
subject of the vastness of our thirst. He complains

figures, £3 9s. 4sd. worth of snakes per head Or
hearing this the true moralist is expected to fall
down incontinently and execute an epileptic fit as
some slight expression of grief. Withal there appear
to have been no seizures to date. .

“Machete”: Can I push in a few deer-

18/9/’l3) that the dingo is a courageous mongrel?
Years ago Hill, manager of Bullamon station, in
South-Western Queensland, started a stud of the
Caledonian hounds with the object of exterminating
the “dogs” which were very bad in that thick coun-
try. The long-legged Scotchmen made very short
work of their brethren, who, when run down, handed
in their resignation without fighting. Like the
Christian in the Coliseum, who never kicked or
jumped on the lion, they passed out quietly.
“C.A.M.”: The ganger of a party of cane-
cutters on the North Coast of N.S.YV. received the
following application from a cook anxious for the
billet of “poisoner” to the gang
To Mr. Smith and Gang.—
Dear Sir, — Re the aid of a good cook for the men
which has been puzzling yous some time, I prefer
myself a pretty lively cook or worker all round —hold
best ref on everythink I touched—yet am willing to
accept the cookery job within one week from now.
Will guarantee a pudding every dinner hour and a
complete luxury every Sunday dinner in the pudding
lines and cakes every afternoon tea, not bread and
butter and jacket potatoes for dinner. I am not lazy
—I will peal them. Theirs only one thing I have
not tried to cook, and that is yeast bred, and as for
that I am willing to come up and have a look at
father for a couple of trips and I will guarantee to
fill the bill with that lot too. Once I seen it done
that does me. I can cook dampers etc., I am willing
to put on the cap and apron and give every man his
rights, liberty and guts enough to face hi-_ work
every day, and as regards luxuries I am willing to
put in bob for bob and obtain it for any little thing
that we may require. I always get plenty of work
myself, but it has been brought up to me time after
time, so now I apply for the same and I am confi-
dent of giving every satisfaction to the end of the
season. Awaiting your reply, I am yours
(better known as featherweight boxer). Goonel-

“Errant” : The different methods adopted
by bushmen, bagmen and others for remembering
dates are many and curious. In W.A. if one asks
when a certain event occurred, the reply comes some-
thing like this: “Let’s see, that was the year Mug-
gins found his show,” or “Two years before the Hang
On and Snuff-out claim was found.” The horror-
remembering cuss reckons it happened “when Red
Mick bashed out his father-in-law’s brains,” or “when
the barman at Gobble-em-up cut his windpipe.”
Then there’s the sport with his “Year after Snoozer
ran second to What’s This in the Cockies’ Purse,” or
“the time the Wild Irishman fought 16 rounds with
Hilly Crackit.” Big events of local importance, as
“The year of the big drought,” “When Dead Man’s
Creek ran a banker,” “The year of the big wind,”
or some other large object are common time marks
all through the bush. Farmers generally time hap-
penings before or after epoch-making events on the
farm, such as: “When Strawberry had twin calves."
or “When I got a 20-bushel crop.” A cocky’s wife
on being asked by a school teacher the age of little
Willy replied: “Let me think. We went down to
Melbourne when father showed the prize pumpkin.
A year before that the dapple grey mare died, an’
she was two years older’an our Bill.” “And how old
was the mare?” asked the teacher. “Why, I thought
every one knew she was aged.” Willy was put down
as 11.

“Eeo Lear”: Re the habits of the dirgo in
the matter of scaling fences and hunting in packs.
“Pick’s” Jingera dingoes (B. 18/9/T3) may not
climb over netting and barb-topped fences yet; but
they may accomplish it to-morrow, next week, or
three years hence. And, once one
animal has managed by accident
or design to circumvent the ob-
stacle, safety for the in ide wool
is over for ever and all ens„ing
time. In the Burnett district
(Q.) sheep men kept dingoes at
bay with the above type of fence
for some years. Then, after
heavy rain, several small wash-
outs occurred under the fence.
Before all c~uld be repaired an
odd dog had got through. There-
after the vermin were at home
on both sides of the fence, because
they had learnt that the barrier
was not impassable, and could be
got under by scratching. And
they scratched. In the Cunna-
mulla locality (W.Q.) the rabbit
fences kept sheep secure for years ;
but now landholders to save their
flocks are compelled to run three
feet of dog-proof netting on top
of the bunny-proof construction.
As for pack-hunting; cattle men
in coastal Bananaland during the-
-1902 drought tell horrible tales
of half-starved weak cows hunted
by six or eight dingoes, caught and
torn open while still alive. In
this controversy I reckon “Pick”
had better wire “A.L.8.” four
beers and one lobster.
“John Moran” : In reply to the inquiry of
“Sluice Box’" (B. 11/9/’l3) as to how the snake per-
forms his annual undressing. I don’t think there is
an annual undressing. I think it depends on how
much food the snake gets. If he is well fed he sheds
his envelope often. I’ve known a carpet-snake to
get out of his coat twice inside of 3even months.
After good tucker for a couple of months the crawler
goes off his oats; his skin becomes dull, and his
eyes lead-colored. He coils up and does not like to
be disturbed, remaining like that for a month or
more. Then one night you will notice him moving
round and round, and as be moves he rubs first one
side of his mouth and then the other against the
floor. If you look closely you will notice the skin
beginning to fray on the edges of his lips, top and
bottom, and very soon the skin will turn back under
the lower jaw and over the top jaw, and the snake
just pushes himself through the aperture. The beast
then looks brand new, and is quite lively and ready
to start feeding on man and other prey again. I
have seen three carpets and two death adders dis-
robing, and it has been just as I have described it
in each case; also it ha 3 always happened at night.
Now I think of it, most disrobing happens at night.
“Gouger”: Came across something that
made me do a hard think recently. Was prospecting
far out North, where a man sees never a white man
for months. In a dry gully, the long grass on either
bank almost hiding the place, lay what remained of
the carcase of a bullock, and inside the carcase was
huddled the skeleton of a man. There was no mys-
tery about it. The skeleton in life had caught the
bullock shooter red-handed, had threatened him with
the penalty of imprisonment, been promptly shot,
and had then been sewed up inside the bullock when
the innards were taken out. It was about as good
a hiding-place as could be imagined.
NOT HIS FAULT.
Seedy Boarder : “Haw! You — haw—may not believe it, don't you know, Polly, but I

POLLY: “Well, fancy ! An ’ me an' mother thought you spoke like that on purpose.”
“Petramos” : When Cassidy took the hyp-
notic course advertised in the newspapers he deter-
mined to put his new-gained powers to practical
use. He nailed Sullivan as his first victim. “Phwat
will ye take f’r y’r black cow ?” he asked. “Tin
pounds,” said Sullivan. “Sullivan,” said Cassidy,
solemnly, “ye mane foive pounds.” “The divil, I
don't,” retorted Sullivan. “Ye’ll sell the black cow
f’r foive pounds,” repeated Cassidy, staring Sullivan
straight in the eye. “Foive pounds,” he repeated.
“Tin,” said Sullivan dogedly. “Foive,” said Cas-
sidy, making some passes before the other’s eyes.
“Foive, foive, foive, foive, foive.” “I tell ye tin
pounds,” cried Sullivan; “divil a cent, less.” “Sul-
livan,” said Cassidy, “ ’tis useless t’ set y’r will
agin mine. ’Tis foive pounds ye’ll take f’r the
black cow,” and he pointed his forefinger at his
victim’s nose, and glared fixedly. “Are ye daft?”
yelled Sullivan. “I don’t know phwat ye’re doin’,
Cassidy, but I warn ye I don’t like it.” “Sullivan,”
explained Cassidy, slowly, “ye’re passin’ into a hyp-
notic shlape. Ye’re in me power, mahn, an’ when
ye wake ye’ll sell me the black cow f’r foive pounds.
Shlape, Sullivan, shlape.” “Shlape, be damned,”
yelled the indignant Sullivan ; (‘if annyone’s goin’
to shlape here ’taint Pathrick Sullivan.” “The
shtronger will must triumph,” persisted Cassidy;
“don’t resist, Sullivan, but shlape, mahn, sh lape,”
and he passed his hand across Sullivan’s brow. Sul-
livan sprang in the air, a shovel in his hands.
“Shlape, is it, ye durned idjut?” he yelled; “then
shlape y’rsilf,” and he brought the flat of his
weapon down on Cassidy’s head. They carried the
hypnotist into O’Brien’s pub, and the scared Sulli-
van sat by the sick man. “Sullivan,” said Cassidy,
when he came to, “I claim foive pounds damages
agin ye.” “ ’Tis yours, Cassidy,” cried the relieved
Sullivan, and dived into his pocket. “Shtay y’r
hand, mahn,” said Cassidy, sitting up, “and marvel
at the powers av hypnotism,” and he took five
sovereigns from his trousers and handed them across
to the astonished Sullivan. “Take them, Sullivan,”
he said, “and when ye’ve given me the black cow
we’ll consider the matther settled.”

“Camp” : You can get some fairly strong
whisky in Tassy on the road to the East Coast tin
mines. Anyhow, that’s what Bill told me. He said
he got some one day at a wayside pub (any other
kind of pub would have suited Bill just as well)
that had some real whisky in it. “Gorspareme-

I blew me nose I burned a hole in me rag!”
“Te Babarantiko”: “Tekelo’s” nursing
troubles (B. 25/9/’l3) with Papua bush boys was
only natural considering how helpless (and con-
trary) most Pacific Islanders are in case of sick-
ness. Remedies of their own are almost non-existent
and what they have are largely of the
Christian Science brand. In case of serious illness
a miniature town of tiny palmleaf huts is built by
the sick man’s relatives a short distance from the
village. The patient is conveyed to his hut and (he
crowd takes up residence in the impromptu town, and
is careful that the sick person has no chance to feel
lonely. After a few days the huts are moved on-
wards about a quarter of a mile, and, by degrees, as
far as the next village, and back until the sick recovers
or dies. In the Line Islands I have seen a liquid made
by soaking the thin, red skin on certain roots of the
pandani tree, together with tender crushed t’un
leaves in water, and used for fever, but without appar-
ent benefit. The great resort in nearly all ailments is
the firestick. For pain in, say, the abdomen, the end
of a stick the size of a pencil is set aglow from
some embers kept in the half of a cocoanut shell.
The skin is lightly touched with the glowing end,
raising a small blister. The vertical rows of blis-
ters, and, later, scars, vary from two to five, and
give the pleasing appearance of rows of small but-
tons. Massage is greatly in favor, be it for head or
bingy ache. Incisions made on the forehead with a
large shark tooth is also a valued headache cure.
But now on most islands the cure-all is Perry Davis
Pain Killer, castor oil, and, occasionally, iodide of
potash.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The line and bridge across the creek upon the esti-
mates are down,
They’re loaves and fishes, so to speak, that come the
way of Mulgatown.
The line won’t pay for axle-grease, and for the bridge
there’s ne’er a call,
But Mulgatown can speak its piece when Big Loan
questions fill the hall.
When loaves and fishes are the tune
The bloke from Mulgatown’s a coon,
Who’s handy with a cod harpoon, and lusty with a

Our member Doormat’s in the joke. He carries
brains beneath his hat.
By day he works the office bloke, by night he camps
upon the mat.
With hat in hand and aspect bland he works the in-
fluence a treat
To get Jack Lynch a block of land or Scott some
new imported wheat.
Your orator’s all wind and skite,
Your broad-browed statesman’s out of sight
When roads and bridges come to light in battle gay
for Doormat’s seat.
He got the town a daily mail. And Emu Vale did
in its block,
And passed remarks absurd and stale when first it
saw our P 0. clock.
’Twas Doormat snared our courthouse new, the stout
brick wall around the gaol.
If everybody had their due the leading lights of Emu
Vale
(My friend, there’s more than you and me
Are out of gaol who shouldn’t be)
Would eat the bread of hominy—a fare prescribed
for morals frail.
So ever unto Doormat sing, and on his brow some

Arise and make the welkin ring, for he’s- the one to
work a joke.
While Party Governments obtain and small majorities

We'll milk the old State Cow again, and loaves and

“Machete”: “Bex” (B. 18/9/’l3) asks for
information as to why white-eyed and black-
eyed crows are found together all over Australia.
The white-eyed kaffir is only the young of the black-
eyed ruffian. After his first year the color of the eve
changes to the sooty hue that matches the other
characteristics of the Devil’s pigeon.

Jobber : The worst of this country is
that people are so short-lived. Not far from my
southern N. S. Wales hut there live together an old
pot and his son, and they both draw the old-age
pension! The boy is thinking of going to the
Northern Territory to make a start.
“Eddyson”: Coombes had been ordered
the Simple Life. The medical profession told him
he had been overdoing things and drawing too heav-
ily on his nerve reserves. “Go into the country ; find
a quiet family ; and take life calmly like a wise
vegetable,” said the medical profession. Coombes
went deep into the bush, and found the Hill family.
It said it was a quiet family. But, of course, quiet-
ness is a relative quality. A man who worked in a
big quartz-crushing mill might think a Melbourne
sixpenny restaurant at noon a peaceful retreat.
Coombes found that there were seven children and
180 head of poultry in the Hill family ; also numer-
ous cows, some horses, a few pigs and a sheep. The
sheep was more in the family than the cows and the
horses because it was a pet sheep, but the cows and
the horses were a good deal about the house.
Coombes spent most of the first day killing mos-
quitoes and improving his knowledge of natural
history. He discovered that no two roosters crow
exactly alike, and that one hen’s conversation differs
greatly from another hen’s conversation in all essen-
tials. At the evening meal the whole Hill family
and a hired man were present. The hired man would
have been unobjectionable had he refrained from giv-
ing life-like imitations of a chaffcutter and a cream
separator in eating his meat. It was really the
quiet Hill family that provided the distraction. Mr.
Hill had “skelped” little Willie Hill for persistently
dipping a potato first into the milk and then into
the sugar. Mrs. Hill fired up for the defence. “You
leave im alone, 111,” she piped. “Don’t you dare
lay your ’ands on my children. ’lt yer own brats, if
you must ’it someone. Willie ain’t none o’ yours,
and you know it.” “I’ll ’it who I like, when I
like, retorted Mr. Hill. “Oh, no, you won’t,”
snorted Mrs. Hill, shaking her knife at him. “Oh,
no, you won t, Jim ’lll—not them as is not yors
you won’t. Not Willie, an’ Nellie, an’ Joe, you
won t. Them as ain’t yors you’ll keep your ’ands
off.” Mr. Hill, who was biting a hot potato, said
something indistinct; all I could be sure of was
that Mr. Hill supposed he’d gotter take Mrs. Hill’s
word fer it. “But who feeds ’em?” he asked when
the potato had gone. “Who feeds ’em? An’ I tell
yeh this—l’ll ’it ’em while I feed ’em. Ain’t that
fair?” He turned suddenly to Coombes. Coombes
coughed confusedly and nearly choked. He had
been making a nervous effort to affect obliviousness
to these painful family details. Mrs. Hill rapped
wildly on her plate. “No interference!” she squealed.
No interference from ’im, nor you, nor no one.”
“Oh, shut up, Annie!” said Joseph Hill, addressing
his mother. Joseph was nine years old. “And you,
too, Jim,” he added. “You orter have better
sense.” Then Mum and Joey started a long “barge,”
under cover of which Hill took down his dinner in
great gulps, and, choking in an effort to accommo-
date a whole chop, escaped into the yard. Coombes
stole out and fed the mosquitoes in the front garden.
Before daylight next morning Coombes had made up
his mind to leave the quiet family. His determina-
tion was due less to Mr. and Mrs. Hill’s long and
loud barney over the limits of Hill’s parental rights,
carried on just beyond a thin partition, than to the
persistence with which the pet sheep wanted to steep
with him.
THE CLIMAX.
SQUATTER: “ Well, keep your cattle out or I'll

The pearling industry is now the one
black spot on the White Australian policy. The
Westralian fleet of 42 boats employs 1000 Japanese
and 800 odd of variegated nationalities. When
approached with the idea of white labor the owners
howl miserably about the ruination of the industry
—which howl sounds all right till you remember
that identically the same howl was raised about
Bananaland’s sugar industry. Fortunately in that
case the howl was disregarded, with the result that
last year there was a record number of acres under
cane, and this year more money is going to be made
out of the business than ever was made in Tommy
Tanna days.
“McNorth”: In attempting to refute my
allegation that the average white stockman or pro-
speetor is as good a tracker as the aver-
age Binghi, “Ivory” (B. 14/8/’l3) states
that tracking is not a general accom-
plishment of the black tribe; only a few
are expert. Which is just what I set
out to prove. Nowadays Black Brother
does not have to pursue the elusive wal-
laby and bandicoot as industriously as
before the advent of the white man.
Most of him (in Queensland, at any rate)
hang round stations and townships, work-
ifio occasionally and living on flour and
other European tucker. Hence the neces-
sity of tracking to live is, in a great
measure, dispensed with. But a white
stockman or prospector has to be able
to track some if he wants to find his
cattle or horses. It’s the same with
spear-throwing. Binghi has not much
use for his spear in these days of guns,
and, consequently, his skill with that
weapon is, generally, a memory. Near
where I am writing this there is a large
camp in which, with the exception of the
w’ire-pronged fish-stabbing arrangement,
there is not a single spear. The nigs
have guns instead. And this is not in
civilisation (it’s a 300-mile ride to the
next pub). The present-day black aris-
tocrat, who has been schooled in a mis-
si°n ' and talks English and smokes
tinned tobacco, scornfully disdains to use the weapon
of his fathers. lie prefers hitting things with a
shot-gun to missing them with a spear.
* *
From Grove Hill (N.T.) :
It was a particularly cast-iron specimen of a hard-
iivmg old bushman who blew into the store last
W i* , After buying his month's rations (flour, cream
ot tartar and soda, salt and tinned dog) he picked
a treacle from the counter and asked-
w hat s this treacle like?" The pea behind the
counter gave his opinion ; it was good. “Oh well ”
said the man from the bush, “I’ll take a tin. A
bloke may as well live well while he’s about it.”
“W.E.”: Those Nunnick forest dingoes
referred to by “Pick” (B. 18/9/T3), must be vege-
tarians. They’re a degenerate lot, at any ra,te, if
an ordinary rabbit-proof fence with a barbed wire on
top stops them from chewing Monaro mutton. The
dingo is a champion fence-scaler if it’s worth while.
One Brett, down Cudgellico way, got tired of breed-
ing lambs to fatten the mallee mongrels, so reckoned
he d keep them out. At short intervals along his
rabbit-proof fence he put in a 7ft. 6in. post, and
hung up another 3ft. width of wire netting. Above
that he put two No. 10 wires, six inches apart, and
capped the lot with barb. Then he sat down and
applauded vigorously—until lambing time. Also my
experience of the beast makes me differ from “Pick”
about his (the beast’s) inclinations to solitude. Cer-
tainly they don’t camp together in the day-
time, as a habit, but where there’s enough
of them to form a choir they have a habit of meet-
ing, generally in the early morning hours, and chorus-
ing mightily.
* * *
“E.S.S.": From Broken Hill right down
to the busy junction town of Petersburg you tra-
verse a big belt of territory so densely populated that
everybody s Wells and dams are marked on the map.
More than half of the places are dams. It is a
good way of filling a map. Queenslanders do the
same; every squattage homestead and many boun-
dary-riders’ humpies are marked in their proper
latitudinal and longitudinal positions. It gives the
territories an appearance of being settled. There
is one place called The Corners. The traveller
hears frequent allusions to it, and when he arrives
there he finds only a solitary post standing in a
wilderness of mulga. There is a similarlv lonelv
mark on the east coast, which some people go into
raptures over. It is only a cairn of stones, marking
the boundary of N.S.W. and Victoria; but there
the coaster can be in both States at once. You can
be in more than that at The Corners; you can
sleep in three by coiling up around the cdrner post.
There are only three other spots in the Common-
wealth where you can be in so many places at once ;
and at one of them, where N.S.W., Victoria and
S. Aus. meet, it is generally too moist to coil up
in comfort.
H.T. : I had only been averaging about
a beer and a half a day for some time. The near
approach of a wedding, with myself the leading
actor, was the reason. You will see I was out of
training, so to speak. The leading actress in the
wedding earned her living by politely snubbing tele-
phone users in Invercargill, the prohibitionists’ pride
of Maoriland. I got three days off, and left the more
or less alluring barmaids of Christchurch for my
lady-love and her pure city of No-License. Before I

very seldom uncomfortably hot; in Adelaide you

perfect cloudless days that anyone could wish for.
rurther north the atmosphere is, of course, more
humid, and therefore the heat is not so bearable;
but it is more bearable than a few days I had in
Sydney last summer, when one had to go about one's
business, in the clothes that civilisation demands —
you can t leave off all but trousers and a cotton shirt
in Pitt-street. If the Centre and Northern Territory
are such awful places, how is it so many people re-
turn to them when they could easily stay away? The
croakers croak because they have never been there,
but make capital out of what some dissatisfied per-
son has told them—and dissatisfied people always
exaggerate. While going up and down the land with
the black-labor \loee in their bonnet they forget the
very thing that Is wanted to keep it a white man's
country—the railway line; the line that is going
to take the white man there and enable him to stop
there; the line that is going to convey thousands
upon thousands to the at present empty North when
the time of trouble comes.

BROWN-BOVERE TURBO-BLOWERS
supplying six of these to the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd., Tasmania.
Fig. 4. Motor-driven Turbo-Blower, supplied to the Skinningrove Iron Co., Ltd.
The Blower is for a duty of 24,000 cubic feet of air per minute, at a pressure of 71b. per
sq. in., and is driven by a three-phase motor rated at 1000-h.p., 440 volts, 40 cycles.
Australian Representatives i
MESSRS. BROWN", BOIERI were among the first to
realise the inherent advantages of turbo-blowing and
compressing machinery, and in the early days devoted
a large amount of time to research and experiment in order to
perfect the design of this class of plant. As a result, the
machines constructed by them are not only designed along the
lines which experiment has shown to be correct, but they
embody the results of a very wide practical experience in the
operation of turbo-blowing and compressing machinery under
all conditions of working. Up to January, 1912, they had
installed over 80 machines, representing about 47,500 h.p.
Their experience has enabled them to eliminate the
features of design which have been found to affect the satisfac-
tory operation of such machines, with the result that the
turbo-blowers and compressors now constructed are flexible,
efficient and absolutely reliable in operation even under the
most severe conditions of service.

Sound, beautiful teeth
are one of the grandest gifts of Nature,
but they are not intended for merely
temporary use, and only temporarily to
adorn the mouth ; they are meant for
a whole lifetime of continuous work.
Consequently they should be always

Odol is the most economical of all dentifrices,
for, owing to the concentrated strength of the pre-
paration and the absolute purity of its ingredients,
a few drops only are sufficient for use at a time.
Poetic Justice and the Mexican
Upheaval.
if the Mexican pot does boil over, as it is
threatening to do, nothing is certain but
that Uncle Sam will get scalded. Also, he
will have to think hard, fight hard, and pay
very hard. As a nation, Mexico has gone to
the woods. As fast as one man wins to the
Presidency a fresh insurrection breaks out,
and the old insurrection continues on general
principles. Five of the 27 States which
make up the federal Republic—States which
lie close to the U.S. border —have seceded
and set up as an independent nation. At
the capital, General Huerta, who over-
threw and slew General Madero, has gaoled
his Congress, suspended the Constitution,
declared himself dictator, and defied Presi-
dent Wilson, of Washington. Wilson says
that if the Congressmen are injured he will
be seriously displeased ; but whether his dis-
pleasure will vent itself by poking his tongue
at Huerta or marching a Yankee army over
the Texan border and blockading the coast,
Wilson does not say. He seems a vague
sort of person. Huerta replies that the
Congressmen will be put on trial, but does
not say on what charge ; and it is safe to
wager that the penalty will include a little
shooting. Huerta has also sent a special
envoy to Japan, and is suspected of trying
to arrange an alliance with the little brown
men, who are already exasperated with the
Yankees over the Californian land question.
When Mexico had a stable government under
Porfirio Diaz, which ruled with some horse-
sense, valuable oil fields were discovered on
the long, narrow peninsula of Lower Cali-
fornia. Individuals supposed to represent
the great Standard Oil Trust tried to induce
Diaz to give them a monopoly over the
whole of those oil denosits. The tremendous
old man declined and shortly afterwards an
insurrection broke out. When the Federal
troops attacked the insurgents they dis-
covered, to their amazement, that the rebels
were splendidly armed with the latest pat-
tern of Krag-Jorgensen rifle and equipped
with almost unlimited machine artillery of
the most up-to-date type. The Federal
troops were mown down, and it became
apparent that the people behind the insur-
rection had money to burn. In the end
Diaz had to get out quickly. But before the
new Government could get securely in the
saddle a counter insurrection broke out, and
now it is the Diaz party that is on top again.
That United States financiers who wanted
control of the oil fields of Lower California
were behind the original insurrection is
almost certain. They have not got control
of the oil fields yet, but they have brought
their country to the verge of war with a
nation of about 15,000.000 people, and if
the war takes place it will be a big, costly
struggle, overshadowed with the possibility
of Japanese intervention. The United
States is great and wealthy, but this riot
will prove the naval and military weakness
of the great chaotic Republic, and its total
unpreparedness for offensive military opera-
tions. If Japan intervenes it is almost cer-
tain that the States will lose Hawaii and
the Philippines for a start. Even supposing
the invasion of Mexico were a mere military
promenade, and everybody who has invaded
Mexico up-to-date has found it a very tough
promenade, the task of reorganising
15.000,000 people at the point of the gun

Some Calculating Yanks and P.F.A.
Fierce language by O.C.C. :
The last Yank mailboat to Ma’s congested capital
four gentlemen who talk rapidly through
thelr noses and have remarkable-looking glad-rags
and a j iurr i et j a i r generally. They are the four corn-
missioners or spruikers for the San Francisco Exhi-
bition (they call it Exposition, or Imposition, or
something), which is (they say) to be held in 1915
to celebrate the “opening” of the Panama Cana.l;
tl"B2jr2Ur3E*
had they the time to wipe the last drops of cocktails
off their moustaches ere Grandma ’Erald and Aunt
’Tildagraph interviewed them. The results were
fer °? ioi i s > no lt°, s . a y alarming.
The first offlclal interviewed was the military com-
missioner Major s> A cloman, who, according to
auntie's young man
“bore an active part in establishing the Republic of
Panama, which granted the territory through which
the canal has been cut to the United States, and
authorised its construction.”
0f course, the ’Tildagraph reporter wasn’t to know
wha * an infamous bit of chicane was the establish-
ment of this precious ‘Republic of Panama, because,
j assume, that great daily’s History Class has not
y e t got further than the late Georgian or the Early
Victorian era. But it was when the Major cut
loose on our Great Natural Resources, no less! that
?. n . e began to feel dubious as to this new Exposition
u seems that we are reaUy some pump ’
, <And ghould you fail to be represented at San
Francisco in 1915, it would be a distinct disappoint-
ment to us that nothing else could obliterate.”
This hits us where we live—we mustn’t let any feel-
ing of reserve set up some horrid unobliteration or
° th er. But the secretary to the commission is the
P each - H ear
, A P ro P os < b® Chicago, and for 30 years
he has been identified with the agricultural machinery
business. Most of his missionary work with agricul-
tural machinery was done in South America.”
“Missionary work” is good. Have we forgotten the
Harvester Trust? The secretary says:—
“It is only a question of a few years at most until
the Pacific Coast States must look to Australia for
meats and breadstuffs. The opening of the Panama
xrs
j n f rozen meats, dairy products and flour. The chance
the Exposition at San Francisco in 1915 will offer
your [four] people to exploit the vast re-
sources of Australia is better _ and more opportune
than . was ever P resented before. ’
So it; a ™ounts to this—-that the Exhibition is to be
supported by us in order to prove that we can grow
meat and cereals to ship away to Unclehamland at
prices lower than we shall have to pay here for them
ourselves. Can’t you see the Australian branch of
the Yankee Meat Trust “competing for New York
City’s and other Atlantic coast trade in frozen meats,
dairy products and flour” ? And in exchange for all
tbe « pr i mar y products” we are to drag out of the
ground, and off the back of the sheep and the
rabbit, and other Great Natural Resources and Aus-
tralian Institutions, what are we to get? Ready-
made clothes of the famous Stein-Cohen brand,
££» S/KSW. SSSSSUWIJS
Australian hides), breakfast foods (from our own
wheat and maize), hats (from our despised rabbits)
and a thousand other manufactured goods, all of
which we ought to make here l Is it our Destiny to
become the grain-paddock, or cow-paddock, or rabbit-
run of the Yank? And, if so, must we hasten to
“exhibit” our degradation from a young Nation to
the status of a World’s Cocky at the Panama Exhibi-
Hon? 1 * I trow— -in fact, I bet—not! Perish the
thought! If we can’t send along a first-rate exhibit
of manufactured articles—things made in Australia
by Australians from Australian “primary products
we had better not exhibit at all.
A Man Like Mr. Johnson.
Thus writes “Petronius Earbiter” :
Like a good many others, I have been fancying
for some time past that the S. M. Herald was
beginning to “shape better” as an Australian journal
—to show signs of having lost a lot of the imp°U'
ing inflammation which has distinguished it and dis-
tressed us in the past. But, no! We have just lost
(for a time) from our shores the Unparalleled
Griffin, but—thanks be to Cook!—the great
Chicago Yank, who was awarded first prize for
Atrocita, or Canberra, or Desolata, returns to
direct the poor blighted, ignorant Australians in
the “laying-out of Disastra! (N.B.—He will do
the job at a salary that, I am credibly informed, is
well over £3OOO a year, plus exes., and he has been
given a nice, long engagement.) Of course, one can
have nothing but good to say of Griffin as an Ameri-
can architect and as an American individual, but
when the craze dies down—and in this writer’s brain
it was buried last week—and the rush for the foreign
Griffin sketch-plans, and elevations, and building
“poems,” and similar things, ceases with a bump,
the still, small voice of patriotism may, perchance,
be heard. The laying-out of Catastrophica is an
engineer’s job—the job of a dashed good engineer,
too, with a wide knowledge of architectural matters.
I am hopelessly Australian enough to think that, now
that the O’Malley Board of fourth-raters lias rioted
all over the Griffin twiddly-bits, it would have been
wiser, fairer and cheaper (not to say more generous)
to have sought in this poor, blighted, incompetent
Australia of ours for the latent talent that possibly
may exist m it, and to have allowed Australian
engineers and architects a chance to show what they
are made of! O’Malley could go nap on a person
like Chinn ; why didn’t he use one-quarter of the
guff, blarney, affection and determination he lav-
ished to keep Chinn in his job on, say, the appoint-
ment of a clever Australian engineer-architect to
look after Calamita? The Kink left things (un-
wittingly) to Cook, and leaving things to Cook is
like leaving them to the office-boy. And this is
where the S. M. Herald comes in! That silly old
woman went into spasms of delighted rhapsody on
Friday last over an • “exhibition” of the cute
Griffin's modern “American” architecture. Said
Grandma
“Most architects, at least in Australia, are satisfied
to produce a combination of bricks and mortar suffi-
ciently ingenious, comfortable, or ornamental in
itself, irrespective of the trees, rocks or water in its
vicinity, save in so far as they affect the lie of the
ground. Mr. Griffin compels Nature to serve his
ends, or, rather, persuades her, seldom destroying
what he finds, but utilising it, and so designing not
only the house, but the grounds, that the building
seems merely the natural culmination.”
So “Mr. Griffin compels Nature to serve
1 • j «« • 1 1 ((•*» _TnnTtvty-
his ends, simpiy because Mr. Griffin IS
imported. Now, where exactly’, has Mr.
Griffin compelled Nature to serve his ends?
Among all the United States cities is there
anything which can teach Australia much of
a lesson? There is not. in all the States, a
•. ~ , e j ’
< lty that for order and picturesqu ness or
glory, comes wilhin a thousand miles of
Paris or Berlin or Hamburg or Brussels,
Griffin’s work is hard to find. There is
nothing in his country to compare with Mel-
bourne or Adelaide, and even such places as
r> ,i „ 1 „ • „ j „„„ •
Bairnsdale, in Gippsland, can give most
United Mates cities points as a mere matter
of town-planning. A few years ago, when
that most capable N.S.W. railway manager,
OLIVER, declared against the policy of carrv
i n g the daily publications of the rich
newspaper proprietaries free by rail ho l
-U 1 JOHNSON succeede/V,; “ e ! ost
ms dna Johnson succeeded him. And
long before anybody m Australia saw John
SON — even before they knew what he looked
like — the cry of certain Sydney dailies wo
that w hat N.S.W. required to put everythin
right in every department was “a man lik
Mr. Johnson.” Johnson arrived, and he
wasn’t exactly a god. Now, with the same
insane faith in anybody who is imported the
demand is for a man like Griffin. ’The
S. M. HERALD couldn t show — not even to
save its soul that GRIFFIN has devised anv
better-laid-out places than Melbourne nr
Adelaide or Bairnsdale or Toowoomba Rul-
. •
he ls TIFFIN, and be IS imported.

UON (J. . cCU a is going the rounds,
warning retailers not to sell, under the name

those manufactured by BORSALINO, GIUSEPPE

CUiar calls attention to an injunction which

p t i e m ..u, Anafroitn • Q

ports something like IUU,UUU Borsalino hats

Sion that the protection afforded by our

the Commonwealth. If that is not so, then
turther confirmation is added to my theory
that about the best protection the Austra-
lian manufacturer has is to be a foreign
manufacturer living in his native land,
r> Y •
"
The Commonwealth is pledged to spend £1,500,000
on a dockyard at Cockburn Sound (W.A.), awl a
further half-million in dredging the place. Thrilled
to the marrow at the prospect of a land boom the
indigenous soil speculator has accordingly got early
(° work, and at latest advices innumerable lots of
ea P . bordering on the Sound have been ‘ cut up,”
gndironed with streets that aren t there yet, but may
be ultimately, and flung on the Melbourne market,
where they will be readily snapped up by those with
a hobby for collecting unearned increment. An elo-
fluent puff-paragraphist has placed his pen at the
service of the vendors, and he points out in sen-
tences which fairly throb with conviction that on
the occasion when Australia’s glorious fleet of 52
EE
will bound to almost any old fissure. It nil looks
quite true. When Cockburn is attached to Fremantle,
Perth and Melbourne by rail, real estate there should
be a sizeable proposition. But why should the pri-
vate speculator benefit from this essentially national
work? The answer is: He shouldn't not to the
ext , ent ° f a farthing. Nor should he at Jervis Bay
and other places where the Commonwealth is expend-
jng thousands, and will, in course of time, expend
millions. The way to block an inequity which
amounts really to a deliberate removal from the
pocket of the community of vast sums of public
money is for the Commonwealth to acquire that land
which is going to be unduly bloated as regards value,
by Commonwealth expenditure. The advocates of
an i ns jg n ifi can t Federal territory are not the whole-
souled defenders of their State’s rights that they love
to appear: they are merely the staunch upholders of
the land jobber and the earth-gambler.

DANIEL CRAWFORD’S
PURE SCOTCH
WHISKY.
When ordering Whisky you naturally want the best.
You therefore cannot do better than call for CRAWFORDS —
THE FINEST VERY OLD SCOTCH WHISKY.
As Supplied to the P. 8 0. and other large Shipping Companies,
POLITICALPOINTS
All last week there was weeping and wail-
ing and gnashing of coals at Newcastle. It
is alleged that the incapable port has
reached some kind of a crisis; that it can
only load about half the stuff that should
be loaded ; that ships wait till the Day of
Judgment for a berth, and then have to
sell the cargo to the Devil, he being the only
purchaser left; that the loss of £2OO pn a
single trip is quite common, solely by reason
of the absurd delays; that congested
coal trains are sometimes 25 hours
late, and that mines have often to
stop working because they can’t get
their goods away. In fact, it is
testified that the whole business has, to some
extent, Burst. But however Burst the busi-
ness may be, the idea of using the adjacent
and vastly superior outlet of Port Stephens
is as much anathema as ever.
AN UNPOPULAR PET.
That State Liberal organisations be asked to im-
press on their candidates the necessity for the regula-
tion of trusts and combines. — Women’s Liberal League,
resolution.
MR. LIP. : “But aven't I told yer 'e wuz
'armless ? ”
MRS. LIB: “ Yes, dear ; but just for appear-
ance's sake don'Wher think it best f put a
tiny muzzle or some restraint on 'ini in
ease we should get into trouble ? ”
Big John Forrest, who believes that Fed-
eral Old Age pensions are wrong in prin-
ciple, because they sap the people’s inde-
pendence, himself draws £lOOO a year pen-
sion from the Westralian State Treasury.
Some of the headings over last week’s
N.S.W. railway news: “Newcastle’s
Plight,” “Serious Congestion,” “Strong
Criticism,” “A Disgusted Deputation,” “No
Trucks,” “Chaotic Conditions in Sydney,”
“Where the Railways Fail,” “Smash at Cen-
tral,” “Brakes Fail to Act.” “Carriage Piled
up on Platform,” also “Mr. Johnson’s Posi-
tion.” It was a hurried week.
Something ought to be done to more-or-
less Colonel Ryrie, M.H.R., who last week
called Higgs, M.H.R., "a miserable body-
snatcher.” Certainly Higgs had been some-
what intemperate in his language about
ltyrie’s political associates, but when he
called them “hypocrites” his speech was
plain and to the point. Ryrie’s was absurd,
lie couldn’t produce any body that Higgs
had snatched. He hadn’t the cadaver under
his arm or the tombstone in his pocket. It
would have been quite as sensible if he had
called Higgs an inebriated oil-painting, or
an opium-eating whale-fishery, or a dishon-
orable. and embezzling omnibus. Ryrie is
a man of big words uttered with a big howl,
and his capacity for not meaning anything
in particular is big also.
“F.C.” writes: —
Melbourne won’t see the Australian flagship at
Cup time, after all. It is not a question of lack of
the sporting instinct on the part of the officers. They
have as much desire as any other officers to do a
flutter. But ships are growing big, and the Aus-
tralia can only squeeze into Victoria s insanely-
selected boss harbor with a high tide and a dead
calm. No one can guarantee either of these, so it
must needs keep away. To ride £2,000,000 worth
of ship, for three minutes of horse is over the odds.
Victoria’s congestion policy has struck the ill-luck
that it deserved. ,
N.S.W. Works Minister Griffith at Junee :
We have a national debt of over £100,000,000,
but the taxpayer is not asked to pay the interest,
because the enterprises pay the interest, and at the
same time develop the country.
N.S.W. Auditor-General Vernon in his last
annual report (the italics and all are
Vernon’s) :
The net results of the reproductive assets have.
until lately, yielded sufficient net profits to cover the
annual interest on the whole capital indebtedness;
the amount for 1912-13, however, fell short of re-
quirements to the amount of £445,462.
In other words, the money in former years
was well enough spent to earn interest, but
under the mad Holman-Griffith regime it
has been so mis-spent that the producers
have to put their hands in their pockets, and
for _one year alone dip out no less than
£445,462 in order to square the bill. And
this was the Government which came into
office pledged to loan money only on
works which would pay full interest and
sinking fund in addition.
According to the British Board of Trade
the cost of living has risen, during the last
32 years, as follows: Britain and France,
15 per cent.; Australia and Maoriland, 16 ;
Norway, 19; Italy, 20; Russia, 21; Hol-
land, 23 ; Germany, 30 ; Belgium, 32 ; Aus-
tria, 36 ; Hungary, 37 ; Japan, 38; United
States, 39 ; Canada, 51. So considering that
Australia has about the best luck that is
going, amid a world-wide rise, why raise the
cost of living by paying an expensive Judge
to inquire about the rise in the cost of liv-
ing? Why not let the risen dog lie?
“Nestor”: One of the nasty
episodes of the closing of the
N.S.W. P arliament w T as the public
abuse of a well-known civil servant
—a very painstaking, hard-work-
ing. capable officer—by one of the
Ministers, in the precincts of the
House, just outside one of the
chambers, before a number of
people. The Cabinet would hardly
approve of the worst methods of
capitalistic bosses being adopted by
those who were sent in to give a
square deal all round. It is not a
very courageous thing for a Minis-
ter. either, to vent his spleen on an
understrapper who has done his
best, especially when the civil ser-
vant can’t well “cheek back” at his
Minister. The officer in question
has been working himself to the
bone over a number of Govern-
ment jobs, and all the thanks the
Minister gives him is public humil-
iation before a number of people,
and a refusal to allow him an
opportunity of justifying himself.
It is hard enough to get ability in
the civil service as it is; but if
men have to submit to the bullying and the
browbeating of a “transient and embarrassed
phantom,” the ability in the service will
gradually become less.
“Henry Horsecollar” writes :
. The Sydney city railway, and its concomitant, the
North Shore bridge, have come to grief again. The
bridge was biffed out first, just as it has been biffed
for half a century, and the city railway, being of
little value without the bridge, and also having the
grievous disadvantage that the building of it would
almost certainly lead to the construction of the
bridge; perished in a natural sort of way. It is a
pity about that bridge. It can’t even meet with a
bit of fluff without falling over the same and break-
ing its neck. A fly is sufficient to trip it up just
when it is going strong. It is the one big projected
public work in the State which would make hay of
an immensely rich Private Enterprise. Naturally
its constant failure makes peonle wonder how much
Private Influence has to do with the ill-luck.
The Argus has every reason to be annoyed
with the Age. During the Referenda cam-
paign the paper which many democrats of
Victoria still read for the sake of auld lang
Syme, said that, if the proposals were car-
ried, terrible things were likely to happen,
simply because the Commonwealth would
have power to make them happen. Where-
fore, said the Age, the only safe thing to do
is to refuse-to give the power. Now, the Age
badly wants the Greater Melbourne Bill to
pass ; but it finds the Argus using its own
old arguments, and warning the public that
the new authority could do terrible things,
and the only way to be sure that those
things won’t be done is to refuse to give
anyone the power to do them. Yet instead
of getting compliments from the Age, for
using old Age arguments, the Argus finds
itself being called an idiot for assuming that
the citizens would elect mad aldermen to do
the insane things suggested.
The president of the Associated Chamber
of Manufactures worked a neat racing-car-
nival epigram into his speech at the annual
meeting last week. “Australia,” he said,
“must forego the splendid isolation of a
gigantic sheep-run, for the winning post of
empire can never be achieved on a saddle of
mutton.”
The death of John Duncan, following
close on that of Joseph Vardon, has hit the
S.A. Liberal party hard. His seat in the
Leg. Council will be fought for by Laborite
Harvey—who opposed Foster for the Reps,
at the last Federal election —and D. J.
Gordon. ex-M.H.R., who gave up a position
as chief of staff on the Register to take up
politics. Edward Lucas replaces Duncan
as Liberal leader in the Leg. Council. He
is a spruce and fluent little Irishman, and
one of the very few softgoods men in S.A.
who trouble about Parliamentary affairs.

“Conning Tower” writes :
Howe, M.11.R. for Dailey (N.S.W.), last week fired a
string of questions at the Minister for Defence regarding
the food conditions on board the Australian war-
ships. Prime Minister Cook implored members not
to make the Commonwealth a laughing stock by
parading every little grievance or hitch in the navy
affairs before the Parliament, and it is to be hoped he
will stiffen his backbone on this matter. One of the
most ridiculous features in the vai ..s State Parlia-
ments is the way every disgruntled public servant
with an axe to hoe or a row to grind gets a legisla-
tive friend to “ask a question.” The N.S.W.
Assembly devoted a whole evening once to
discussion of the grievance of a fireman who
thought he had lost a few shillings 10
years before. As for the Select' Committee which
inquires through ensuing decades as to why Bloggs
was separated from his job in the sanitary service
whole reams of paper could be covered. This world
isn’t spotless, and, so far as I have heard, never will
be. Probably even in the household of Howe,
M.H.R., the soup isn’t always perfect, or the corned
beef wholly above reproach, or the mustard Dot
shining like the Jasper Sea or the glassy walls of
Paradise. And the premises may not look entirely
like the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Some allow-
ance must be made for human deficiency and human
impecuniosity. The worst thing that can be done to
the best-regulated navy is to make it a means of
advertisement for cheap politicians, who clamor about
its imperishable wrongs when there is too much rind
on the breakfast bacon.
At a social function in Sydney last week,
F. W. Ward, of the Telegraph, descanting
cn W. B. Griffin, designer of the Yassberra
capital, said “if he (the designer) had been

ney was built, what a Sydney we would see

WADE: “Yah! Socialist!"
From the press gallery :
Apart from policy, the N.S.W. Labor party made
its most conspicuous failure in the Upper House. It
fell between two stools. It hesitated to swamp, which
was its obvious course from the jump ; and when it
made a feeble attempt to redress the balance against
it, its nominees were a poor lot, only one man being
competent to meet the enemy, and that one promptly
went over to the other side. The leadership of the
party in the Second House was put in the hands of
Flowers, who failed dismally, as was natural, first
because he is more Conservative than even the older
crowd in the Upper House (was it not Flowers who
declared he did not believe in municipal govern-
ment?), and next because he never got within coo-ee
of grasping the meaning of the measures he was in-
troducing. It was the commonest experience to have
men like Carruthers, Tom Hughes, J. A. Browne and
Ashton get up, after Flowers had tried to show the
meaning of a Bill, and say, “What the Bill means is
this” and proceed to explain the measure which
the Government representative had not understood.
And, having done that, they would ask the House to
kick it out or amend it beyond recognition. It is
not too late even now to swamp ; but the Government
does not contain one man who may be regarded as a
constitutional authority, while they are so nervous a
lot that they jump at their own shadows.
Vic. State member Mackey is introducing
a Criminal Appeal Bill. It is the English
11)07 Act with improvements. Thus it is
proposed to give the Courts power not only
to quash decisions but also to vary them,
or to order a new trial, or even to uphold
them in the face of a valid technical objec-
tion, if no substantial injustice is thereby
done to his Majesty's prospective guest.
This sounds like good, sound sense, calcu-
lated to narrow the barrier between Dives
and Lazarus by discouraging the Yankee
dodge of endless and manifestly unjust liti-
gation. Incidentally, appeals may be taken
on matters of fact or of law, or a little or a
lot of both, and the two may be mixed. If
the A.ss makes these and a few more sen-
sible innovations, the man on the beat will
scarcely be able to recognise it as the old
animal which he never quite knew whether
he had firmly collared by the ear or not.
Westralia. despite its respectable-looking
sinking fund, has some rotten methods of
finance. In the Railway Department nothing
is put aside, as a steady thing, to provide
for renewals; consequently, when recently
a fairly big sleeper-renewal job had to be
undertaken, four-fifths of the cost had to be
—or at any rate was —charged up to loans.
Which means that, in addition to borrowing
the money from Cohen to pay for the trous-
ers. the State has now gone to the pawnshop
and pledged the youngster’s credit to pay for
the patch on the old man’s worn-out gar-
ment.
According to Melbourne Argus, State
Treasurer Watt’s Budget speech was a
“story of prosperity”—and its two outstand-
ing features are announcements (1) that
the State is about to borrow half a million
to erect school buildings, and (2) that the
Weary State’_s imports during the past year
totalled £25.081.074, and its exports
£l9,ll3,l2l—leaving a debit balance of
£5.967,953. It is indeed a tale of wild
affluence, just as though Watt, in the days
when he was a mere clerk, found his pay-
ments amounting to £l9l in a year and his
purchases to £250, and then borrowed a fiver
to pay for his youngster’s music lessons.
THE SLEEPERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The fathers, . despite hard work, deemed it a dis-
grace to lie abed. Their sons, wearied with pleasure,
kept their lazy bones within the sheets on Sunday
morning. These people had no place in their lives
for the religion which had made it possible for them
to be here at all. They were moral invertebrates,
and, often enough, social parasites. This indifference
must have a disastrous social effect. — From the Itev.
Sourr’s Baptist Union address ( Melb .).
Awake, arise, ’tis Sunday morn !
The sun is shining overhead,
And fierce ecclesiastics scorn
The sluggard wretch who lies abed.
Shake off the blankets’ evil spell,
Get up, apply yourself with grace
To bear, with puritanic face, ;
The tongues of parson and of bell
That warn you off the shoals of HcL !
The wickedness of wicked ways
Have been recited many times.
They’ve often changed within our days.
Just now most heinous of our crimes
Is that of villains who infest
Their beds while pulpits vent their din
To waken sleepers to their sin.
Arise, and suffer with the best —
Behold it is the day of rest!
Oh, spineless ones, so warmly lodged
’Tween linen sheets, you’ll rue the day !
By you the tinkling plate is dodged,
Ye never hear the pastor pray.
Must Church to win such worthless skunks
Revise her present sitting scheme,
That worshippers may lie and dream
The service through, and stretch their trunks
Where pews have given place to bunks?

SAVED A WELL-KNOWN PADDING-

UNDERGO AN OPERATION.
“Two years ago,” says Mrs. H. E. Deacon,
grocer, Campbell and Hopewell Streets, Pad-
dington, “through contracting an internal
complaint, I was advised to undergo an
operation by my doctor, but I did not feel
inclined to consent to its being performed.
1 tried Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, as I
thought that they were doing me a lot of
good. They had a tendency at first to
create a feeling of sickness, which, when
over, the benefit of the pills manifested itself.
I think they are a wonderful remedy, not
only for ordinary complaints, but for any
internal derangement. I would not be with-
out them under any consideration, and I
hope this may be of use to you in publica-
tion.”*

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The most reasonable Melbourne Cup tip
at time of writing is “Wait until Monday.” Both
the Derby and Cup have a very open appearance,
and admitting that a dandy 3-year-old would be
very likely to Win the big handicap, the difficulty
is to guess which Derby colt (there are no fillies left
in the race) will do the trick on Saturday. Radnor,
who may have been short of work when Beragoon
wore him down in the A.J.C. Derby, was severely
damaged in his reputation for stamina when Duke
Foote and Harpist beat him so easily over two miles
a week later. There is no just cause or reason, on
paper, why Beragoon should not beat everything at
Flemington that he beat at Randwick; but he and
all of them have shaped badly in w.f.a. competition
with older horses, so the chances are that none are
first-class. Moreover, a Vic. Derby win for Bera-
goon, Radnor or Andelosia would not mean that he
was bound to beat Ulva’s Isle and Marculfus in the
Cup, for these two are sons of Positano —probable
stayers both of them —and if they miss the Derby
they will meet the aforementioned trio on a stone
better terms in the long race. If either of them
should win the Derby, he will jump from 6st.' 71b.
to 7st. 61b. in the weights, and be strqngly fancied.
They seem worth considering for both races. Ulva’s
Isle is very stoutly bred ; and Marculfus performed
like a possible top-notcher the last time he ran,
which is more than can be said for Beragoon, Rad-
nor or Andelosia. Marculfus is sluggish ; yet, with
a strong boy on his back, he might win the Derby
from the colts he has not yet met in public, and, in
any case, he and Ulva’s Isle are this scribe’s Cup
fancies as far as the 3-year.-olds are concerned.
Of the older horses nothing looks dangerous below
the mark of Sea Prince (7st. 51b.). Cagou, at
Bst. 131 b., is certainly to be preferred to Aurifer
(9st. 21b.) on the Metropolitan running, and because
he ran second in last Sydney Cup, where he out-
stayed Posinatus. But Cadonia gave Cagou a lot
of weight, and beat him, and the cowlike Cadonia,
even on his best behavior, cannot be thought of as
a really great horse. It is fairly arguable that the
uncertain Hallowmas, who ran a good race with very
bad luck when he finished second to Piastre last
November, is best worth backing of the heaviest
weights in this Melbourne Cup.
Hallowmas may have gone off a lot, but one must
remember that this time last year was his best time.
Harpist, a proved stayer (in races where the pace
was not violently fast), has Bst. 51b. as against the
Bst. 61b. of little Ladies’ Man, and the 7st. 121 b. of
Wassail (son of Malster, and therefore a supposed
non-stayer). From some points of view, Harpist
is a good thing for Melbourne Cup, but he has done
nothing brilliant thusfar. He beat Cadonia over
three miles. Everything has beaten Cadonia at one
time or other. He appeared to get Duke Foote going
over two miles at Randwick the other week. All
the same, he failed to make the pace hot enough to
settle the doubt as to Duke Foote being a real
stayer. The Melbourne Cup probably will be faster
than the w.f.a .event at Randwick. Posinatus may
not quite last through a severe two miles’ struggle,
according to his form up to date. Uncle Sam and
Anna Carlovna also will fail at the finish, in this
writer’s opinion. What about Sea Prince, the only
reasonable hope of all the Victorian horses now re-
maining among the Melbourne Cup acceptances? The
sour imported animal, with three 12-furlong races to
his credit, looks good enough to carry 7st. 51b. to
victory. He will have another jockey on his back
next Tuesday—Killorn instead of Turner —and may
run kindly enough. Assuming the son of Persimmon
(sire of Comedy King) to be a stayer, and remember-
ing that his disappointing Caulfield Cup performance
was at least respectable, one is bound to fancy Sea
Prince a little on his form, apart from his private
reputation, which may, or may not, be wholly false.
The writer thinks there are some grains of truth in
the moody chestnut’s reputation, strengthened of late
by solid work on the track.
Taking Cagou, Harpist, Posinatus,

SEA PRINCE,
whilst repeating the advice, “Wait until Monday
before trying to pick it.” Few Melbourne Cups
have looked so open a week before the race.
Moonee Valley Cup result was another
facer for the local trainers. Greek Fire, a S’Aus-
tralian gee of no great pretensions, won from the
aged Broadsword, with Sanskrit (also from Adelaide)
in third place. Except that Limelight, fresh from
Sydney, ran as though he was not yet himself again,
the race probably represented form as it is at pre-
sent. The winner doesn’t look at all dangerous in
the Melbourne Cup.
The flying Traquette is apparently a
cert., as such things go, for the Maribyrnong Plate
on Saturday; and surely Crosska has a great chance
in the Coburg Stakes.
S.A. Jockey Club has taken its long-
promised step of appointing stipendiary stewards to
act at its meetings ; and other clubs can have their
services for a consideration. M. J. Hogan, who has
had a lot of experience in N.S.AV. southern districts,
and latterly in Sydney, is to be chairman, with £6OO
a year. A tremendously keen competition for the
other two places ended in a dead heat for two Ade-
laide men —Tom Wigley (lawyer) and Clem Hill
(sharebroker and cricketer). They get £4OO each,
with the right to continue their professions if they
want to. Considering the stalwart Wesleyans they
have always been, there is a lot of Horse about the
Hill family. John Hill, father of Clem and the
other cricketers (and himself a fine batsman in his
time), is managing director of the big coaching and
mail-contracting firm of Graves, Hill and co.

The English Jockey Club has at last pro-
hibited the use of assumed names by racehorse own-
ers. There has never been any public sympathy with
the practice, save in the case of the Yorkshire parson
of old, who ran some fine gees of his own breeding
under the nom-de-course of “Mr. Lowndes.” A
famous mare named Apology, which won the Oaks
and Leger, brought the owner’s real name and call-
ing into notoriety. His identity had been known
only to the inner racing world; but the sporting
press talked about Apology as “the parson’s mare,”
and the secret was out. Whereupon the parson s
bishop asked him what he thought of himself, and
the good man replied that he was not ashamed of
his misconduct. He had inherited two or three valu-
able mares, and had bred from them, and confided
the management of his racing stud to a trainer.
Personally he had never had a wager or been on a
racecourse in his life. But the bishop bade him
chuck either the turf or his cloth, so he chose the
cloth, and died a good old parson.

The prospects of a Victorian horse win-
ning this Melbourne Gup are so poor that possibly
one of them will do the trick —a surprise is just
about due. Only two winners during the past 10
years have been trained in Vic., and one of them —-
Comedy King—was English-born. Seven winners
came from N. S. Wales. Blue Spec (1905) was
classed as a Westralian. In the preceding 20 years
15 Victorians got home; of these Carbine was bred
in Maoriland. Auraria represented S’Australia, and
the other four came from Sydney. Eight times in
the past 20 years a 3-year-old has been successful.
Five winners were in the “8-stone and upwards”
division; 13 were in the 7-stone lot, and only two
carried less than 7st. The ordinary 6st. 71b. boy is
pot strong or experienced enough to ride a 2-miles
Cup winner.
As the result of what the High Court had
to say about the V.R.C. committee’s treatment of
Frank Meyers in the Blackpool case, that sporting
hosier has been invited by the autocratic tribunal to
come and have his case “reheard.” Meyers is ad-
vised by his solicitors to stipulate for an open in-
quiry this time, with counsel at the back of him,
and press reporters present. There are no new facts
to be produced, and unless the new light of publicity
were thrown on them, the same old secret tribunal
would not suffer any great temptation to own up to
an injustice. If the invitation to the owner of Black-
pool were “please come and accept an ample apol-
ogy,” he would doubtless go like a bird ; but under
present circumstances he would be merely running
the risk of hearing that after further consideration
(in camera) of his story, the committee saw no
reason to alter its decision. A tribunal that gazettes
“suspicious practices” as an offence, and never gives
any reasons for so doing, nor any reasons for sticking
to its suspicions, is practically condemning itself.
Its own practices are suspicious.
The Parisian’s leg trouble broke out again
at the old place, and he has gone into final retire-
ment, with the full strength of his “form” still
untested. The Parisian was rarely wound up, and
only twice in his life started for a long-distance
handicap in the character of a “moral cert.” Each
time he won very easily. As a five-year-old he can-
tered home for the Australian Cup, carrying 7st.-odd.
Next season he won the Melbourne Cup with Bst. 91b.
up, going away from the runner-up like a shot out of
a gun. The farther he went the better he seemed
to go, and nobody could say exactly how good he
was at two miles and upwards. Charles Wheeler, his
trainer, who is reckoned a better judge than most
experts at the game, wouldn’t hear of Trafalgar being
a match for The Parisian on his best days. But,
then, the gelding’s best days were so few and far
between. He was a heart-breaking animal to train,
owing to his habit of striking himself when fully
extended.

The newly-formed Umpires’ Association
and the N.S.W. Cricket Ass. are threatening to get
right into holts. Last week the Cricket Ass. jumped
on the umpires’ claim to appoint referees, and also
heaved out the demand that “no umpire shall be
appointed to office in any match under the auspices
of the Cricket Association unless he is a member of
the Umpires’ Association.” Somehow or other the
Cricket Ass. discovered that the proposals sniffed of
preference to unionists; a thing anathema in the
haughty circles of the Ass. Yet the demand simply
amounted to a request that only thoroughly trained
umpires should be appointed.
The Yankee amateur invasion of Aus-
tralia has now been patched up, and the wandering
band will begin its rush for medals, certificates and
such-like . Unsubstantial things at the Australasian
Championships meeting at Melbourne on Jan. 26.
Thereafter, the Yanks will compete in the various
State championships before thev wipe the dust of Aus-
tralia off their elegant footgear.
Amid all the horse rush at this season the
official returns of the rifle clubs in the Commonwealth
come as a refresher, like a long beer in a weary
land. Out of a total strength of, 49,564 the efficients
total 35,050. And, please don’t forget that to be
classed as “efficient” the shooter has to score with
70 per cent, of his shots. Riflemen put in more time
on Australia’s behalf than all other sportsmen
lumped together, and deserve well of the land.

“Blackbutt”: Stand by and hear me
speak: J. F. Bradley is the finest sprinter the Ma
State has sheltered beneath her covering wings for a
long while. Recently he ran 100yds. a half-yard
worse than evens. Last week the same speed-merchant
threw 75vds. behind him in 7 2-ssec. ; and then on
ton of all this he picked up the South Sydney cham-
pionships on Saturday last: 100yds., in 10 l-10sec. ;
and the 440yds. in 53sec. Bradley should give
the oncoming Yanks a fine tussle in the Australasian
championships in February.
Australia is going to welcome the dusky
Duke Kakanomoku in December, this year. He is
universally admitted to be the world’s top-notch
swimmer, and the fact that he will take part in the
Australasian championships meeting on January 3,7,
10 and 31, and February 2, and also the Queensland
Championships on Jan. 17 and 24, is putting the
local talent on its mettle. Many reputations have
been buried in Australia, and it is auite possible
that bv the time he is through the Duke may be a
very shorn and shaven Kanaka.

Next Saturday will see the long-talked-of
race between the scullers Arnst and Pad don. Breth-
ren, just consider what sort of a struggle it should be
if they put all their hearts and. souls into it. Arnst,
of Maoriland, aged 30 years, weighs 13st. 31b. in
condition, and is 6ft. 0 3-Bin. high. Paddon, of
Evan’s Head (N.S.W.), is 27 years of age, 13st. 121 b.
in condition, and 6ft. 3-Jin. in height. It may not
be absolutely a battle of giants, but the pair are
about as gigantic as it is safe to be. If you are too
enormous you can’t turn round, and you become a
freak.
A really sporting event, the Race Round
Adelaide, has been inaugurated by the S.A. Am.
Ath. Ass. The course, which begins and ends on the
Victoria Park racecourse, is 10 miles. The runners
skirt the city, and are never outside its boundaries ;
and (thanks to Light, its surveyor and founder) they
can travel on the broad grassy belt of park lands all
the way. Adelaide men have hardly got the long-
distance habit yet, and the event was a gift for
various ex-Englishmen of the Y.M.C.A. Soutar won
in 63min., with Harley 2min. behind; then P. C.
Spouse and Burford.
Rupert Jeffkins, who since leaving Aus-
tralia the other day has developed into one of
America’s motor-speed kings, and John Wren are
arranging motor-car races on the latter’s Richmond
pony course. The moan of the Wowser on the sub-
ject of “brutal sport” is still unheard, though train-
ing for the thrilling business has already begun. So
far a 65-miles-per-hour gait is about the limit. But
that should be enough for excitement-lovers. The
track, though banked, is only 60ft. wide at its
narrowest, and but 912 yards to the lap. Moreover
and above, Douglas Campbell, of Melbourne, who pos-
sesses a speedy car, has challenged the newly returned
speed monarch or scorch emperor (meaning the afore-
said Jeffkins) to race for £250 a side, in two two-
mile and a one-mile heats —winner of any two dashes
to collect the boodle.
Schneider, one time N.S.W. amateur
cyclist champion, has been quite unable to strike
form in Europe this season, and as a last resource
has joined a troupe of stage cyclists bound for
Egypt. This is about the first time a great road
cyclist has left the open spaces of the country road,
or even the more circumscribed space of the city
track, for the cramped vaudeville stage. But it will
probably turn out the more profitable branch of the
business.
The Petrol Substitutes Committee, which
has been sitting in England for some time, has now
'definitely reported that the new by-product spirit
obtained from coal is capable of being cheaply
treated so as to make it available for use in internal
.combustion or explosive engines. The actual fluid is
of a light yellowish color, and belongs to the benzole
classification, and has proved to be quite as good as,
if not better than, petrol for motor fuel. A produc-
tion of 40,000,000ga15. per annum in England is
now assured, so presumably the price of petrol spirit
will begin to tumble rapidly. It will have to in
England, anyhow, as the new spirit, it is anticipated,
will be sold at about Is. per gallon.
The last first-class match of the English
cricket season was a picnic for Australia’s old friend
Barnes, who had played in only three other first-
class engagements during the year. On behalf of
;the Rest of England v. Kent and Yorkshire the
veteran took 11 wickets for 79 runs. His figures for
the four matches were 35 for 351. England has
found no bowler to rival Barnes, nor any new men
who can beat Blythe. The best of the younger
bloods this season were Drake (116 wickets for an
average of 17 runs) and. Booth (181 for an average
of 18J). Hitch, the young man whose half-way hop
set the Australian crowds laughing, was almost %s
destructive as Booth. Foster’s name didn’t appear
in the list of averages for either batting or bowling.
In India the white men were beaten badly
at their own cricket game this season. The quad-
rangular tournament of Mohammedan, Hindu, .Parsee
and European teams ended in a draw between the
two former, who had vanquished the two latter.

“Mark IV.”: N.S.W. National Rifle Asso-
ciation landed itself in & bog last week, over the
decision in “The King’s Prize,” worth £lOO. Ed-
wards had registered a score of 285, while McAlister
had scored 281, and was about to fire his last shot.
A “bull” would have given him the prize, and an
“inner” (four) meant a tie. He got an inner, but
the marker signalled that he had exceeded the time-
limit (60sec.) by 15, and disallowed the last shot.
The matter was referred to the executive, which up-
held the decision, but by some weird turn of the
wheel the two men were sent dow r n to shoot off.
McAlister won. The disallowing of the “inner” was
referred to the council, and by a vote of seven to
six the verdict and the £lOO were awarded to
McAlister. McAlister is a fine fellow and a good
shot, and this writer hates to say a word against
the decision which brought him luck. But the other
fellow is a good chap, too, and Justice, brethren, is
mighty. Truth compels one to remark that there is
no earthly justification for the final verdict. The
rules distinctly lay it down that the rifleman must
fire all his shots inside lOmin. According to the
testimony of the range officials, he exceeded that
limit by 15 sec., and, therefore, should be outed.
The worst feature of the business is that the men on
the executive feel that they have received a slap in
the face, and are talking of resigning in a body.
It will be a national disaster if they do, for the rifle-
men are a valuable association of citizens, and the
executive, judging by its past record, is one of the
best. Perhaps the men on it will consider that the
good of rifle-shooting is above a question of personal
pride. At least it is to be hoped so.
Saturday saw the conclusion of the third
round of Sydney First-Grade cricket. It was a
bowlers’ day, the top scores being Iredale, of Gordon
(84), and Pratten, of Western Suburbs (61). As
regards the matches, Gordon, having smacked up 280,
defeated Balmain (247) by 33 runs on the first
innings. Waverley (264) roamed over Petersham on
the first innings by 123.. . Central Cumberland, other-
wise Parramatta, smashed Western Suburbs with
317 to 210, a victory by 107 on the first innings.
North Sydney, having piled up 315 for the loss of
nine wickets, wisely declared, and set to work to
turn the other crowd out quick and lively so as to
register a full-time win. But Glebe struggled so
hard that North Sydney had to be content with a
first-innings’ victory by 180. Redfern came up
against Svdnev, and scored 308. Sydney could re-
spond only with 86 and 137, and so lost by an
innings and 85 runs—a regular dog-walloping. Pad-
dington, having accumulated 387 for two wickets,
arrogantly declared. Middle Harbor hit un 118 and
62 for four wickets, so the suburb on the hill won by
269 on the first innings. Summed-up, 83
wickets fell for 1404 runs, an average of 16.91
runs per wicket. The men who mainly brought
about this disastrous result were Grummett, Shep-
pard, Folkard, Makin and Hopkins. Grummett took
four Sydney wickets for 56. Sheppard got away with
seven Petersham wickets for 62. Folkard, of Bal-
main, smashed up seven Gordon wickets for 127.
Makin, of Redfern, blasted four Sydney wickets for
32 and two for 26. Hopkins, of North Sydney,
dynamited five Glebe wickets for 21. It was a great
day-—for the bowlers.
The long-postponed battle between Dave
Smith and Pat Bradley filled the Sydney Stadium to
overflowing, and at last the myrmidons on the doors
refused to take cash and set themselves to hurl out
bodily the men who tried to storm through regardless
of the news that there was not even standing room.
As a matter of fact, there was standing room, but the
astute Baker doesn’t allow men to stand in his
Stadium, because they block, the view of the people
who sit. It was a great and gorgeous crowd. Writer
remarked to Mr. Baker after the mill that it was
a fine exhibition of pluck on the part of the beaten
man, and Baker said softly, reverently, as though
pronouncing a benediction, “Yes, a glorious house!”
Pat Bradley, with his contusions and all the rest of it
thick upon him, staying himself with a flagon of
champagne, replied to the press expressions of svm
pathy, “Gentlemen, he walloped the Devil out of
me, but I’d gladly take twice the walloping every
night, barring Sunday, for half the house.” Dave
Smith, seen while being rubbed down, pointed to
some glasses, and remarked, “I never touch it myself
but go right in. He was as brave as a lion.” “Well'
you won a splendid victory!” we of the Fourth
Estate remarked over his liquid. “Yes, yes; a splen-
did house!” he replied dreamily.
It was a highly-strung audience that watched them
advance for the first exchange. The silence was
spacious. Half that vast assembly expected to see Brad-
ley walk right in, take a few bad wallops, swing, and
then —see Smith on the floor handing in his resigna-
tion. Bradley came in, in that fair and warlike
manner so characteristic of him, his right glove over
his chin, his left poised lightly, slightly extended
prepared to take all that was coming, till he got THE
opportunity. Smith lingered the fraction of a second
on tiptoe, then Bradley swung. It was an eminent
wallop, and it crashed down on Smith’s neck —but it
fell on a swinging door. Smith was flying from the
scene, but after the impact he suddenly reversed, and
came in with a left drive of no small importance, and
landed right on that which Bradley smells with.
Bradley reeled, but as he reeled over came the left
with a towering smite. Again Smith was not there.
It missed by inches. The habitually-absent Smith
smiled. Bradley rushed in, and once more as he
swung the lightning-like left flashed out and caught
him on the nose while his smite was still in mid-air,
destroyed the aim and sent the blow wild. Smith
swung a right and left, and then danced away like a
cork on a raging sea. He was absent some more.
That, absolutely, was the fight summed-up. For 20
rounds Smith evaded the swings or anticipated them.
He was in the next county when they arrived. Some-
times he was even touring in Europe. Once, in the
first round, Bradley sent out a sort of feeler, and it
caught Smith right on the point and sent him stag
gering. Had it been aimed as a blow, the fight had
ended there. But it wasn’t. And it served to make
Smith understand where his danger lurked, in the
quick sudden swing as he left a clinch. After that
he was on his guard. In spite of all his precau
tions, Bradley landed him several times in the sa.me
way—but not on the vital spot. And those were the
only blows that Bradley managed to land. Early in
the mill Smith met a charge of Bradley with a righ;
swing that looked capable of waking up a slumber
ing elephant. When Bradley came from his corner
later on his left eye was closing, and for the rest of the
evening that eye took little notice of the master-
pieces of literature and art. The closing of that
eye was the beginning of the end. Half-way through
the fight Bradley was a man who saw out of one
half of his face only, and the fact spoiled his aim.
He became futile and insolvent, and banged at the
wind. Still at the end of every clinch he swung the
blow that had carried him to victory so often. But
this time he was up against a faster man than he
had ever met before, and the swing struck a hollow
void. As Bradley wasn’t fighting the hollow void
the blow didn’t count. Yet even in the very la=*t
round the sally of Bradley’s garrison missed Smith's
chin by only the fraction of an inch. When the
gong sounded the end there was only one possible
verdict—and referee Scott placed his hand on the
personality of Smith. The crowd stood up as Brad-
ley stepped through the ropes and cheered and cheered
again. He had fought a good fight, but he had
failed to batter his way into the charmed ring of
first-graders. “Life’s dream was o’er.”
The victory of a 50 to 1 outsider in the
English St. Leger, coming after a 100 to 1 “turn-up”
for the Derby, suggests that the fastest of the Eng-
lish 3-year-olds this season are weedy things wanting
stamina. The Epsom Derby course is a severe 12-
furlongs test, and the Leger is more than 1J mile
longer. In a field of 12 Night Hawk was ‘tailed off”
half a mile from home ; but as soon as they got into
the straight he overhauled the tiring 11, and eventu-
ally won easily. A couple of 33 to 1 chances and a
20 to 1 chance filled the next three places. This in a
field of 12 only. If the English books can lay start-
ing prices which are undreamt of in the philosophy
of the Australian ring, how sore is our need of the
Tote in the two rich States where Ikey and his
friend Wowser have still got Parliament by the
throat!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He came to me the other day,
A pencil in his fist.
“I want some horses’ names,” said he,
“To make a little list.
My painful lack of horsey wit
Has put me fairly out of it.”
I gave him half a dozen names
Of horses said to be
Enlisted for the equine games
Run by the V.R.C.
He put. them down all in a row ;
Reciting them, he turned to go.
“But why,” I asked, “this curious freak?”
No snigger twitched his lip.
“How can I,” said he, “all the week
Give other chaps the tip
If I (to my eternal shame)
Don’t know a blessed horse’s name?”

The only way to keep
cool and vigorous in the
hot weather is to keep
the system cleansed.
Rriischen Salts re-
move Uric Acid, brace
and stimulate the body
and remedy all liver and.
kidney troubles, Gout,
Rheumatism and Lum-
bago.
The stomach and
kidneys are frequently
thrown out of gear by
the heat, and the first
symptoms of disorder
Keep cool!
Not a Fizzy Drink
must on no account be
ignored.
Take every morning,
on rising, a half-tea-
spoonful of Kriischen
Salts in a tumbler of hot
water.
Headache, undue
fatigue, loss of appetite,
indigestion, lack of
spirits, are put to rout
by Kriischen Salts, and
in their place will come
the clear vision, the
energy, the buoyant
vitality and the joyous
glow of radiant health.
Kruschen Salts are not
effervescent, and therefore do
not cause flatulence. They
can be taken with perfect
comfort by the vast number
of people whom gaseous and
aerated mixtures do not suit.
Kruschen Salts do not
spur the body to any un-
natural activity; they help
it to perform its natural
functions by supplying the
salts which are essential to
health.
The Case of Rheumatism or Gout
which Kriischen Salts cannot
benefit has yet to be discovered.
Doctors, at homo and
abroad, prescribe Kriis-
chen Salts—and what is
more —use it them-
selves. When the sys-
tem’s balance is upset
by the heat of the
summer Kriischen Salts
will preserve and restore
the proper working of

“Splitte Skirte” : The impudence of some
folks ! Likewise, their inability to see them-
selves as others see them! The latest to
inveigh against the new style in female dress
is, of all absurdly and improperly clad human
beings, an Anglican Archbishop. Hear Ur.
Wright, of St. Andrew’s Cathedral, as re-
ported by the Sydney Telegraph :
There is a want of delicacy in the dress of to-day.
One lady said recently, “I don’t care what I wear
so long as I startle people.” Such people forget the
sense of proper decorum, and unlock the forces of
passionate desire which cast aside a noble self-
restraint to work all manner of grievous mischief.
In Melbourne, we read, two or three women not
properly dressed were ordered out of a ballroom, and
I venture to say I would like to see that firm and
dignified stand taken by other hostesses.
For years past I have writhed with shame
at the spectacle of our Archbishops, Bishops
and Archdeacons promenading the public
streets and other places in costumes which
disclose practically the whole of their legs,
and outline, in the most brazen fashion, every
detail of the wearers’ figures. Many a time
have 1 seen modest women and their escorts
slip into bars, etc., as an Archbishop, or
what not, was to be observed advancing to-
wards them —a clear proof, to my mind, that
the garb of the higher order of Anglican
cleric constitutes a powerful incentive to
drink. Far, far worse, in a moral sense,
these carefully-studied allurements than the
frank, healthy limb-exposure of the surf-
bather. Let a Vigilance Society be formed,
with the object of compelling Dr. Vv right and
his colleagues to cover up their legs, and to
cease from swathing their waists in infam-
ously suggestive bandages. The writer will
be among the first members and the most
strenuous workers.
A somewhat voluminous scrap from The
Bulletin’s Oldest Inhabitant: —
Some of the journals and other papers of Lachlan
Macquarie, Governor of N. S. Wales from 1810 to
1821. will be offered for sale in London in February.
The 29 lots will, at first, be offered in one lqt; then,
if the price is not satisfactory, they will go up separ-
ately. Of the journals, the first covers Macquarie’s
“inspection of the interior of New South Wales,”
which means the County of Cumberland, also Cam-
den and the Coast about Newcastle. The second deals
with Van Diemen’s Land and the planning of
Hobart, in 1811 ; and the third refers to his tour in
the new country west of the Blue Mountains in 1815.
There are also many letters and documents on the
early history of Australia. The whole, it is under-
stood, belong to an old lady relative of the Mac-
quarie family. It is understood that a cash offer was
made for them by the Government; but the owner
prefers to test their value at public auction, though,
of course, they must come to Sydney in the end. The
Macquaries came from the Hebrides, and one of the
family is mentioned in a letter from Boswell to Dr.
Johnson (July, 1777), at a time when Lachlan was a
youngster of nine. Among other things, Boswell
wrote: —
“Macquarry’s estates, Staffa and all, were sold
yesterday, and bought by Campbell. I fear he will
have little or nothing left out of the purchase money.
The gentleman who purchased Ulva is Mr. Campbell,
of Auchnaba. Our friend Macquarry was proprietor
of two-thirds of it, of which the rent was £156 ss.
This parcel was set up at £4069 ss. Id., but
it sold for no less than £5540. The other third of
Ulva, with the island of Staffa, belonged to Mac-
quarry of Ormaig. Its rent, including that of Staffa,
£B3 12s. 2Jd.— set up at £2178 16s. 4rl.—-sold for
no less than £3540. The Laird of Col wished to
purchase Ulva, but he thought the price too high.
There may, indeed, be great improvements made
there, both in fishing and agriculture; but the in-
I*l SSTS
There is an island called Little Colonsay of £-wj
yearly rent, which I am informed has belonged to
the Macquarrys of Ulva for many vears, but whi
was j a tely claimed by the Presbyterian Synod of
Argyle, in consequence of a grant 'made to them bv
Queen Anne. It is believed that their claim will L.
dismissed, and that Little Colonsay will be sold for
the advantage of Macquarry s creditors. What think
Jg
church of England?. How venerable would such an
institution make the name of Dr. Samuel Johnson
in the Hebrides!”
while in Australia Macquarie is known to have
saved every penny of his earnings in order to re-
purchase the familv property in the Hebrides, and he
succeeded, though he only lived to enjoy it for about
(- wo years after his return. His savings were eon-
sjderablv added to bv the will of Andrew Thompson
of t j, e Hawkesbury, who left him a considerable por-
tion of his estate.

worker, you require heavy sleep
and plenty of it.
So leave your call with Big
Ben. Go to sleep and sleep your
best. Forget the rising hour.
His merry morning call will
call you every day at any time
you say. It will keep on call-
ing until you’re wide awake.
Big Ben stands seven inches
tall. He’s massive, well poised
triple plated. His face is frank,
open, easy to read —his keys
large, strong, easy to wind.
He’s two alarm clocks in one —a
long alarm ringing for five min-
utes continuously, an intermitt-
ent alarm ringing for ten min-
utes at half-minute intervals.
Big Ben is made in La Salle,
Illinois, U.S.A., by Westclox. His

“ How are you
feeding him ? ”
Next to maternal
milk, nothing is so
good for feeding babies
as Albulactin with diluted
cow’s milk.
For Albulactin is simply the
vital nutritive and digestive
element which is so abundant
in maternal milk—and so lamentably deficient in cow's milk
and other foods.
Write to-day for a Free Baby-book.
Therefore, babies digest this
mixture and thrive on it as per-
fectly as if they were breast fed.
Lady Howard de Walden—
mother of “the richest twins in
the world”— writes : ‘‘The twins
are being fed on Albulactin, and it
suits them very well.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is happily becoming much more the custom for
people in society to go out of their way to be civil
to Antipodeans. This is due to a desire to draw
together the threads of humanity into the loom of
Empire. Antipodeans are invited to social functions
to which they would probably never receive the entree
but for the fact of their residence outside England.
—Bishop Frodsham, in London Morning Post.

HARRISON 0.
The Oldest Inhabitant’s house and land
agency notes: —
The old Wentworth h»use at Vaucluse (B.
16/10/T3) was originally owned by Sir Henry Brown
Hayes, who was transported for life for abduction.
Having means, he purchased, through Simeon Lord,
the land for £lOO, built a house, and named the
place Vaucluse. The snakes bothered him, and, so
the legend goes, he sent for some Irish earth, and
encircled his cottage with it. After that, you couldn’t
find a snake on the premises unless you searched
with a corkscrew. Hayes being pardoned, he left in
1812, and the house passed to Colonel O’Connell, of
the 73rd Regiment, who had married Mrs. Putland,
a widowed daughter of Governor Bligh. They occu-
pied it until they left for India in 1814. Somehow
or other Captain Piper got possession ; but when he
made a mess of things, it passed, in 1827, to
William Charles Wentworth, in whose family it re-
mained until it was resumed by the Government.
Greycliffe, another Wentworth home, which is to be
resumed by the Government and used as a hospital
for babies suffering from gastro-enterflis, belonged
to Fitzwilliam Wentworth, and was occupied by
him from the first ’7o’s. During one of the owner’s
frequent absences, Chief Justice James Martin lived
in it. A few years later Mrs. Martin occupied it,
while James was back at Potts Point. The couple
are now united in a handsome mausoleum on a
jutting crag close to the ocean in the Waverley
Cemetery.
That generous feeder, George Reid, gives
it as his opinion that George V. will prove
“bne of the greatest kings in English his-
tory.” Wonderful how monarchs improve!
When Victoria died, a frenzied London
pressman commenced his leading article with
the words: “Yesterday passed away the
greatest personality the world has known
since the days of Jesus Christ.” (The article
didn’t appear, by the way.) Yet Edward
VII. was said to be greater than Victoria,
and Geo. V. is apparently going to beat
Ed. VII., and consequently be very much
greater than Victoria. Behind "V ictoria
were Geo. IV.,' “the first gentleman in
Europe,” and behind him was James 1., who
had the whole blessed Bible dedicated to
him. Behind them again were kings who
Were called the Confessor, the Martyr, the
Csesar, and the Great. The struggle that
every sovereign puts up to be the very best
t 0 date must be tremendous, with all these
records to beat. It is a wonder that he
doesn’t tear some of the buttons off his coat
in the effort.
The grounding of the new Dutch boat
Houtman on the Proudfoot Shoal is Ihe
latest reminder that the Australian sea
traveller takes his life in his kit-bag with
unnecessary frequency, pnd that the Federal
authorities can’t , hurry too much with the
coast lighting job. The Bananaland Gov-
ernment, it appears, stationed a lightship
near the Shoal for. years, but removed or
abolished it some time ago, just when the
tourist was becoming plentiful. Banahaland
bids pretty briskly for the tourist traffic,
but it always seems to have looked on a
dark coast as a sort of extra inducement to
the person who travels for pleasure.
The barn-like Scots’ Church, on Church
Hill, Sydney, has had only three
permanent ministers in its 90 years. The
first was John Dunmore Lang, who held the
pulpit for 55 years ; the last was the just-
dead Dill Macky, who held it for 25 years.
The sandwich-man was the Rev. A. M.
Jarvie, who there preached the terrors of
Hell for 10 years. Notwithstanding Lang’s
opposition to State aid, he built his church
with Government money, and enjoyed the
Government stipend (paid to all who were
in receipt at the passing of the Abolition
Act, 1863) until his death.
The folly of Owe’Sullivan’s Artificial
Ilump and Dead End station at Sydney
was illustrated last week, when the brake
on an incoming train failed to act, and the
outfit started to climb the platform and run
wild among the enthusiastic populace. If
the railway ran right through Sydney and
across the harbor —as it ought to do, no
matter how much influence wealthy Sydney
Ferry shareholders can employ to the con-
trary—a train which overshot its mark at
the big station would simply pull up and
come back. It wouldn’t start to heap itself
among the waiting passengers and bang them
about, and throw broken limbers at them,
and otherwise misbehave. For a very busy
station the Dead End idea is a curse. It
causes incoming and outgoing trains to get
mixed; makes the engine that dragged in
the train a useless confinee in a cul-de-sac
till, some considerable time later, a new
engine hitches on to the other end of the
train and drags it out, thus making it neces-
sary to have two locomotives instead of
one. Then, when the train is dragged out
by the second engine, the first engine blocks
business and makes confusion until it can
contrive to flee for its life on to a side line,
where it has to wait till it is appointed to
a new job. When a train goes mad the
result is much smash. Incidentally the
habit of throwing passengers out at a Dead
End station, a mile from the business centre
of Australia’s biggest city, leads to conges-
tion of the streets, and overcrowding of the
tramcars, and running over of dogs, and
terror of elderly females, and now and then
it leads to more smash. One of these days
it will lead to most smash. The final re-
sult may be unparalleled smash.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf or going deaf, you Will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are No mystery or
secreev about it ; We describe it fully-, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same Way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able, No one can tell you are Wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them—
the strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. \V hat
a relief to have'done With that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds. .
So that you may clearly understand how the Sountl
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natuial
drum. Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt
the ear. It fits the ori-
fice of the ear with pre-
cision and comfort. The
division that runs across
the mouth is to allow the
removal and insertion of
the Ear-Drum, and to
brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lo t
the he a r ing-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend - ■
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of- the
absurd claims made to-day. But
if you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (we
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
Even a child can insert and remove them without
the least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are only
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also an
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but the
pair you get at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order Form below, and the Outfit will be sent you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t delay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

For the Country Horseman
The saddle here illustrated is expressly designed
for country use, for stock riding, etc., and is built
of the best materials throughout. If any of our
friends are requiring such a saddle they will find
this a genuine bargain.
It has a hogskin seat, a plated bar-tree, extra
lon'' flaps, with points to buckle below. An economi-
cal feature is the skirt, which extends all round
and thus adds years of wear to the saddle by pro-
tecting its interior from the weather. It has a
deep, “sweepy” seat, 4in. kneepads, nickel-plated
iron stirrups, and double buckle leather girth. The
price complete is £3/15/- Mention of The
Bulletin when ordering will ensure your having a
leather surcingle given in free, and the saddle will
be forwarded freight paid. It is to be obtained
from J. P. Talty, 388 Sussex Street, Sydney.

ferior imitations to deceive you. Look for the signa-
ture of Alfred Ardlev on genuine. Price 1/- and 2/6.
Obtainable from all Chemists and Stores in Australia.

slightest change in the weather would affect it, and
I would have to go home from work feeling fit for
nothing. My sister swears by Chamberlain’s Cough
Remedy, so I thought I would try it. I did so, and
can honestly say it has worked wonders, for iny
throat is now quite strong.”*

BANANALAND
Called in at Cairns lately the ship Nor-
folk, laden with railway iron for the Mount
Mulligan line. The stuff, however, couldn’t
be landed at Cairns, as it was consigned to
Brisbane, whence it will shortly travel back
to Trinity Bay. No wonder the North dis-
trusts a Government conducted so flagrantly
in the interests of the South, and no wonder
it begins to see here and there that unifica-
tion and reconstruction of State boundaries
is the one practical cure.
Captain G. A. Taylor, secretary of the
Queensland Institute of Local Government
Engineers, recently pointed out to that As-
sociation, in a paper on “Sneed the Factor
in War-time,” that “Japan. 3500 miles away
from Port Darwin, is actually nearer to it
than Cloncurry, the terminus of the nearest
railway transport.” Still Taylor should
remember that we’ve got at least a couple
of hundred camels available for the continua-
tion of the journey.
“Politicus”: The McKeen motor-train
seems destined to prove an incubus. Present
writer, who has travelled almost- dailv by
the contraption, can cheerfully testify that
for unpunctuality, frequent break-downs and
general crankiness the Yankee notion is
ahead of nearly everything on the road. It
is said that Commissioner Evans (who
never approved of the introduction of this
concern) damns it heartily. The public
certainly does.
Says the annual report of Queensland’s
Commissioner for Public Health :
The crude birth-rate (per 1000 of mean popula-
tion) for 1912 was 29.70, higher than for any pre-
vious year since 1902, and higher than that of the
Commonwealth for 1912 (28.65). The crude death-
rate for 1912 was 10.96 as against the Common-
wealth’s 11.23.
More striking and significant still are the
figures regarding infantile mortality,
Queensland giving 71.4. as against Eng-
land’s 105 for 1910. Austria’s 205, and
Chili’s 313. Yet there are still monomaniacs
who go round lamenting The North’s unfit-
ness to rear a white race.
Old George Fox, who represents the cocky
interests of Normanby electorate (C.Q.),
has just put in a first appearance this ses-
sion. It had got to his ears somehow that
Parliament was sitting and might rise in
November, so he hurried along. Not that it
made any difference to the talk, because he
never says anything when he is there. Still,
when the cockies remember what a dandy
non-commissioned agent the old man is, they
are quite content.
“Kobbi”: Bananaland’s estimates provide
for the hatching of three additional Binghi
settlem nts, Chief Protector Howard having
persuaded the Government that segregation
is Black Brother’s only hope. One of the
new experiments will be on some island in
Torres Strait; another will find a perch
midway between Cairns and Thursday
Island? at Pascoe River; the third is to put
in an appearance at Tam O’Shanter Point,
which is about 20 miles north of Cardwell.
It was at Tam O’Shanter, about 40 years
ago, that one of the first Papuan e> peui-
tions came to grief. A syndicate known as
the N.G. was formed in Sydney to search
for gold in the big island up north, and
the brig Maria was chartered to carry the
company of 75 to fortune. But the Maria
was a leaky vessel, and when the monsoons

struck her she made a bad showing and
finally piled herself up on Bramble Reef.
Thirty-five paid the toll, sharks and blacks
accounting for most of them. The rest were
by the medium-sized leviathan Bas-
ilisk. The authorities, it seems, were a bit
suspicious as to the proposed doings of the
•adventurers, and the Basilisk was sent to
keep an eye on them. That suspicion was
the best bit of luck the syndicate had ; other-
wise Binghi would have got the lot. The
captain of the Basilisk, by the way, was one
Moresby, who afterwards discovered and
named Port Moresby.
Talk about vitality! About 12 months
ago, at Wycarbah, some prickly pear was
thrown up on to the galvanised iron of a
shed, and left there. And notwithstanding
that its tail was unduly warm at times, the
plant continued to hang on to life, and finally-
flowered and bore fruit! The settler who
expects to dodge the prickly curse by going
to Gehenna may yet find himself out in his
reckoning. •
The deadly Northern climate again!
Lately the Liberal —at times very Liberal —
Government of Bananaland “permitted” the
retirement of a Northern police inspector on
full pension, six years before the retiring
age. 111-health and the climate were alleged
to have got him down. Now it is announced
that the ex-officer has been appointed Liberal
organiser for the same district. Of course
it’s all. right; but if there’s a Labor sympa-
thiser in the public service who reckons he
ought to get at 50 the pension that isn’t due
to him till he’s 60, and asks for it on the
ground that if he got it he’d be in a position
to do some cheap organising for his crowd,
lie’ll probably find Digby Denham quite un-
sympathetic.
A Northern Idyll.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Wide spreads the tawny down
In dunes of drifted sand —
Blue hills and grasses brown—
Of my warm northern land ;
Arched with her jewelled nights ;
Or golden, glowing days,
When, on her cloudy heights.
Red suns blaze.
Saltbush and mulga plain :
Brakes where flame-trees bloom
Star-flora, dewed with rain.
Glimpsed against the gloom ;
There, in an ancient song
Born of wind and sea,
Quandong and currajong
Sang to me.
Rock-ridge and river-bight,
Where tropic tendrils twine ;
Marsh-land, and wooded height
Of gum and bunyah-pine ;
Therein such friendship lies
As shall not pass away—
Warm as her ardent skies ;
White as day.
Friendships of buds and bees,
Hills, and flowers, and streams,
Bright birds, and ragged trees,
Men, and dogs, and teams ;
These linger in the heart
After youth has sped—
Ribbon’d and laid apart—
Loves long dead.
Ere yet the morning star
Pales to daybreak’s gleam,
Youth, ranging wide and far,
Captures many a dream.
Out where the lancewoods grow,
And desert tracts are bare,
Dwell many folk I know—
Woven of air.
L’p where the red sun lifts
Against the eastern gate;
Out over river drifts
Broadened into spate;
Or in the pathless glades
The kindly spirits roam.
Bushward, their gentle shades
Make for home !
Thereby, the hills and streams,
The dunes of drifted sand,
Harbor those gracious dreams
Of my warm northern land ;
Where, in their ancient song,
Born of wind and sea,
Quandorg and currajong
Sang io me.

O. G. A. COLIES.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, October 25, 1913.
My Dear Tiiargomindaii,—
The fete pest has broken out again. To-
day it attacked the outlying suburbs with
great virulence, especially at Red Hill, where
Lady Macgregor, assisted by her official half
and the Paget child, grappled with the emer-
gency. At Dutton Park, Mrs. Huxham
aided and abetted the noxious social weed
with malice aforethought and her brightest
smile.
Two golden weddings have been celebrated
this week. One was that of Captain and
Mrs. Burke, two very well-known old people.
Alderman J. E. Burke, once Mayor of South
Brisbane, and Captain Peter Burke, of the
Porpoise, are sons. Old Captain Burke >
came to Brisbane as A.B. in fhe Erin-go-
Bragin the first boat that brought immi-
grants to Queensland. He started work on
the river, and built up a shipping business,
of which he. is still senior partner. In 1887,
when the big floods on the Logan occurred,
he was captain of the steamer Fanny, and
saved some 60 lives or thereabouts, and 1m
is very proud of the testimonial he was
given by the grateful and damp survivors.
Mrs. Burke, who was then Miss Sword, was
also a passenger to Brisbane by the Erin-
go-bragh.
The other golden celebration was that
of Mr. and Mrs. R. H. Mills, of
Kangaroo Point. They are a fresh-
looking young couple, and are seen at
most of tire concerts and musical
shivoos around this burgh. Daughter Amy
Mills has a very good contralto voice, which
she uplifts in aid of manifold charities. The
accursed climate was represented by Mr.
Gill, father of the bride who was enjoying
her golden wedding. He is barely 96 years
of age. In the early days he was in charge
of the post office at Ipswich. Two other
couples who have passed the fiftieth mile-
stone in their married life came along to add
their congratulations to the heap. They
were Mr. and Mrs. Holder Cowl, and the
Hon. J. and Mrs. Cowlishaw.
Vice-regality and the lon ton gathered on
Monday night in the Centennial Hall to
hear Winifred C. Wilkinson (better known
as Winifred Moore) elocute, etc. As one
nasty critic put it, Winifred did everything
but balance on a tight-rope and perform in
a tank. Certainly she had a very busy
evening. She was Portia, and Juliet, and
then in a scene from Othello she double-
banked the parts of Desdemona and Emilia.
She also danced a Spanish dance (the pro-
gramme said it was Spanish) and uplifted
her voice in song. The Othello scene was
the funniest. The bed where the smothering
was done was a very modern and horribly
wobbly four-poster. Othello, when his
grisly work was done, peeped cautiously
round the curtain and muttered “Ha, not a
movement.” Desdemona, coming to life in
order. to be Emilia, immediately gave him
the lie. The wretched four-poster barkfed
like a dog. The amateurs supporting Wini-
fred were a fairly scratch lot, and their
most serious moments were greeted with
shrieks of impolite laughter from the audi-
ence.
Leon Berliner, who was playing a pretty
pianoforte solo in minor chords (one of the
artistic events of the evening), had his
music drowned by a conversation or verbal
uproar in the front row of the stalls. One
of the offenders was a well-known station
man, and his voice rumbled through the hall
like all the three bears of Goldilock’s adven-
ture, rolled into one.
Yesterday Aviator Jones made a number
of flights, and carried several passengers.
This afternoon he made an attempt to fly,
but a tyre burst, and he was son™ *•

Yours affectionately,

I saw no evidence of race deterioration
whatever among the people of the North
On the contrary, I believe their physical
quality and energy is, if anything, superior
to that of people elsewhere. I met many
people from the South who have settled in
the North, and there is no trace of deterio-
ration among them. I had opportunities,
too. of observing people born in the North,
and neither in them nor their families is
there a trace of degeneracy. The infant
mortality of the North is exceedingly low
perhaps the best of all tests of climatic con-
ditions.” — Dr. Elkington, of late years Pre-
sident of the Queensland Board of Health.
The Queensland Labor party clamors for
a Referendum on the new Elections Bill.
And Old Stodge replies, for once with per-
fect justice, that Queensland Labor has been
so hostile to the Referendum on previous
occasions that it surely can’t be serious on
this occasion. It can’t be craving in real
earnest for what it so often reviled. Which
recalls the fact that the Referendum is a
huge plank of the Federal Labor policy—so
huge that you could build two houses with
it Then a time came when Hughes was
shouting for a dry. far-inland Federal capi-
tal whLh couldn’t in any way compete with
Sydney, where his own wharf-lumping con-
stituents are. And when a Referendum was
proposed Hughes’s scorn of the whole idea,
and his. contempt for the public intelligence
as applied to that particular matter —well,
they were six times bigger than the plank
itself. The plank looked like a chip by
comparison.

Mr. Fred Peakman, of Wairoa, New Zealand, is another wonderful case. His hairdresser tells
he had not a scrap of hair, and now, after a few months’ treatment with my preparations he he, 6
got a splendid growth of hair.

liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
H.F.: Considerable promise in the effort
....L. Mahon: This paper is tied to neither Wade
nor Holman. All it is tied to is its own principles.
And because one of its leading principles is financial
honesty and plain-dealing, it can have no truck with
a Government whose administration lias been an
orgy of extravagance and financial crookedness.
Heaven alone knows how the Labor party can have
any truck with such a Government either ; but it
will wake up in time —if it isn’t dragged to its
ruin first. It is the duty of this paper to howl in
the party’s ear in the hope that it will wake up in
time to save itself. .. .Brolga: Cut out and post to
accountant giving date and page. This is the
second time we’ve made this remark.... Baldy: That
yearling-calf-follerin’-her gag may have been told to
a Melbourne policeman in your hearing, but there’s
nothing' strange in that. Even comparatively re-
cent stories of Obadiah, Jonah and Moses (particu-
larly Moses) are recalled to Melbourne policemen
occasionally.... H. L. Lismore: Don’t think 50....
Ben: intimate history of the small local “drunk”
isn’t of general Australian interest. In fact, it isn’t
of any interest whatever Telephone Lineman:
Yes; but an inspection of the ballot papers can’t
disclose how any individual voted.... Cassowary: It
is a very good notice; we had a par about it 12
months ag0.... Carver: It may be true; but we
should hate to chance it and spend the next election
campaign in ga01.... Oildag: Passed to Souter for
his sins, which are many. .. .Ibex: Too vague and
wordy.... Max P.: The fact that one was paid for
on a higher scale than the other indicates that it
was judged the better of the two at this end. Sorry
to hear that you differ, but we can’t help that....
A. Bond (Melb.) : Sorry work unsuitable for us. Try
any of the Melbourne weeklies. .. .A.A.D.: Torrent
of mild jokes received. You may write payable stuff
later on, but we refuse to prophesy... .M.U.: Very
amateurish verse.... Don C.: Reminiscences unsuit-
for B W. O’H.: Poem too wild and jagged....
S;H.: Written in purple ink on both sides of the
paper! Assuredly you will be d—d E.F. (V.):
It isn’t Australia’s welcome ; it is your own exclusive
whoop, and a dashed poor one... ~ .R.T. (S.A.) :
Haven’t thought about it at all. It is the sort of
thing that doesn’t need thinking about. ... Gerald
B. : A sort of flicker. The lady is the most interest-
ing figure, but apparently you dare not use her....
Hatter (V.) : Mush.... Mint: “Summer Time” only
fit for the furnace. ... .Will F.: Your severely simple
story is not good enough. .. .N. 8.: Who appointed
you? Disqualified for 1ife.,... Jumbo : A nice bit of
paper absolutely ruined, t.. . J.P.G. (Paris): Unsuit-
able for us. Can’t suggest another paper....
G.E.L.: Don’t do it again—or, if you do, please don’t
do it for us. .. . Rastus: It won’t crowd anything
out; it will just help to congest the basket
Gobbler: No earthly or infernal use to man, beast,
devil or reptile. .. .A. A.P. (Charters Towers): Crude
bush rhymes of no print value.... G.E.8.: Send it
to the paper in which the original article appeared.
It will probably be rejected, but you can squander
a stamp on it if you like. .. .L.F.Y.: Wearisome
stuff.... Stewart Island: Plans and specifications for
right kind of girl not very alluring. ...G.8.: Lines
not so much bad as rotten.... D. 8.: Thoroughly
original and villainous. .. .Excelsior Australia: We
will not “in union join with hands and social voice.”
Dashed if we will!. .. .W.K.F.: No force. ... D.E.J.
(S.A.) : A small idea in ragged verse. It makes an
appeal which is disallowed R.P.J.: The poem
wherein the poet addresses a mute and respectful
audience at great length grows tiresome after the
first furlong., . .John Q.: “To E—” is so melting
that it should have been forwarded in a bottle....
O’P. : “Ballad” is too sugary, and the other too
shadowy A.S.: (and 48 others) : That (‘limit” story
is in the Commercial Travellers’ Club museum....
White Eye: Two of them stale as the cellar of a
deserted pub ; the other fired on suspicion. .. .Vakuta:
We feed our Chained Anarchist on people who write
on both sides of the paper. Drop in and see him any
time you’re passing and don’t forget to bring a
sample of that very faint ink and the mapping pen.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
R.V.J.: The person who makes it “dashed shovels”
instead of spades has had his day. It wasn’t much
of a day, but it was all the day he deserved.... T.
Walsh: There is just one thing wrong with your art.
It isn’t art.... Len Beck: The lady with the split
skirt is simply beautiful. We would like to buy
her. But the remark she is making to the man in
the wonderful pants lacks interest. .. .W.8.R.: Don’t
care for Mabel, and regard Kitty as a fraud....
P.P. : Before sending in any more drawings on the
subject of Cook’s majority, please remember it is
still possible to hire criminals in Sydney, and the
next man who sends in a picture on that subject will
drive us to it.. . .M.G.W.: Decline to regard picture
of decayed female moaning about spasms as a side-
splitting jape... .J.S.: “The Difficulty” is a some-
what unpleasant one. . . .F.A.J.8.: Subject already
dealt with.... B.: Have a hazy recollection of hear-
ing that yarn before.
N. S. Wales has at least one instance of
sea captain turned sky-pilot. A. J. Gardner,
now rector of Forbes, went to sea young,
and worked his way up, the ratlines to the
dignity of a master’s certificate. Then he
adjourned to a university to qualify for the
Church; and nowadays, instead of roaring
stentorian orders for all hands to man the
topsail halliards, and go aloft and throw the
main-deck overboard, he pours out quiet,
scholarly sermons, punctuated with quota-
tions from Shakspeare and “In Memoriam.”
Up there on the Lachlan he leads the
strenuous life, and covers much coun-
try on a motor-bike in search -<)f souls
to cure. There have been cases of high
ecclesiastics going to sea in a warlike sense
and doing good service, but this is a rare
case. Peter was a previous example, but
then the Sea of Galilee can hardly be reck-
oned as a nautical school.
The first medical man to enter into pri-
vate practice in Australia was Pr. Martin
Mason, who arrived in the old transport
Britannia, on July 18, 1798, as medical
superintendent of 94 female convicts. An
ancient chronicler says: “The cattle which
came in the Hunter, and were sold by
auction about the same time, were not
.greater objects of contest than were these
ladies.” The Britannia remained in Aus-
tralian waters, whaling, and Pr. Mason,
being temporarily employed relieving sur-
geons on the official staff, and as surgeon of
11.M.5. Buffalo, sent for his family and
settled in Sydney. In January, 1804, the
full staff of surgeons being complete, Mason
went to Green Hills (now Windsor), and
commenced private practice. After the
arrest of Governor Bligh he gathered the
clans of the Ilawkesbury to the defence of
the imprisoned Governor. This brought
about his own imprisonment; but Mason fol-
lowed his persecutors to England, his ex-
penses being defrayed by public subscrip-
tion, and gave strong evidence on John-
ston’s trial. He was rewarded with the
usual grant on his return and went on the
land.

TERRIBLE AGONY
All Over Face, Used Cuticura Soap
and Ointment, Not Suffered with
(t Since, Also Cured Husband and
Daughter of Sores.
35 Susan St., Annandale, N. S. W. “I
used to suffer terrible agony with a scurfy
itching all over my face, especially in sum-
mer. I was told by a friend to try Cuticura
Soap and Ointment, which I did, when I
found my face getting better after using one
cake of Cuticura Soap and a little Cuticura
Ointment. I have not suffered with it since.
I always used the Cuticura Soap for the
baby and he has a lovely skin, also to keep
my own skin nice and clear, and always
recommend it to my friends.
“My husband had about six or seven
large sores for which he tried ointments
from the chemist, but they would not heal.
I told him to put some Cuticura Ointment
on them. He did so, and they were better
in about a week, so we always use it now.
My little girl scalded her finger and there
was a large sore, nearly the size of a shilling,
coming and spreading. I was afraid blood
poisoning was setting in till I thought I had
a little of the Cuticura Ointment left.
I put it on and kept bathing it with Cuticura
Soap and warm water, and I could hardly
believe it, as it was healed after only using
a small portion of the Cuticura Soap and
Ointment.” (Signed) Mrs. A. Laundry,
October, 1912.
Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment do
so much for poor complexions, red, rough
hands, and dry, thin and falling hair, and
cost so little, that it is almost criminal not
to use them. A single set is often sufficient.
Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment, are
sold throughout the world. Liberal sample
of each mailed free, with 32-p. Skin Book.

The peace-at-any-pricers who blither about
the Commonwealth Defence Act “making
criminals of our boys” won’t get much am-
munition out of the defaulters’ camp at
George’s Head (Sydney). The tents are
well-pitched and shifted to new ground at
intervals; Ah Pong never heaves a basket
above the horizon, because the camp grows
its own lettuce, cabbagee and callot; rein-
forcements of fresh meat and bread arrive
every day ; the Y.M.C.A. has fixed up a big
cement-floored marquee and stocked it with
parlor games and literature; and every
Saturday evening the Association’s musical
battalion puts Dull Care to rout with har-
mony. For the rest, while the defaulters
aren't sleeping or eating or swimming or
reading or playing outdoor or indoor games
or listening to vocal and instrumental con-
certs or lying around skiting about all the
goals they didn’t kick last season, they are
making up the missed drills; and all the
time, whether at work or at play, they are
getting used to healthy discipline. In short,
the “brutal punishment of our boys” is a
well-regulated picnic, with just enough
wholesome work thrown in to keep the fun
from becoming monotonous.
In a dry town (Maoriland) :
The entrance to the hotel yawns like a dark, un-
inviting chasm. There is no one in the office. There
never is. It seems as if the proprietor had aban-
doned all hope of profit, and given up keeping books.
Ultimately you find a slatternly girl who thinks
there is a room vacant. The fact that it is really
untenanted is due more to the climate than to
cleanliness. If you are wise you look at your sheets
and towels by daylight. If you leave the inspec-
tion till you go to bed it will be too late to get
fresh ones, even if you should retire as early as
8 p.m. There is no one to attend to you at that
hour. The office is then locked up and in darkness.
I think the slatternly girl is locked up, too.
If you should seek the smoking-room you will
find it is’ always called the commercial-room. Liquor
having been abolished (officially), smoking is now
at least a suspect. In the commercial-room a cheer-
less fireplace is surmounted by a glass over-mantel
which advertises somebody’s whisky—a relic of bet-
ter days. The chairs are covered with horse-hair
waiting to come through like a beard on the
blue-black jaw of a tragedian. They are very slip-
pery chairs to sit on, and when they have been
slipped upon often enough the points do come
through. They have all reached this stage. Whether
this sort of chair naturally gravitates towards the
No-License district, or whether they attain this
stage only in a No-License district, I have been un-
able to determine, but there they are.
In response to a mournful gong at some extraor-
dinary hour, you descend to the dining-room, and
discover the fons et origo of that elusive smell which
has baffled you ever since you arrived. A few dis-
mal people "glance at you furtively as you enter, and
you wonder why they look so ashamed of themselves.
Then you catch a glimpse of yourself in a misty
mirror arid realise that you look just the same your-
self.
In the morning, after some exploration, you find
the bathroom hiding away in a dark place, and you
turn on the hot-water tap with trepidation, Your
misgivings were justified. It simply “gurrs ’ at
vou. You watch it patiently for a moment, and
then turn on the cold tap. This opposition excites
it into activity. The “gurrs” change to staccato
coughs, each more promising than the last; but
there is no hot water. The coughs retire up the
pipe diminuendo, and die away in a satisfied “gurr”
of content.
You descend for breakfast into the elusive aroma,
now mingled with fried fish. When you go to pay
your bill you see the nroprietor for the first time.
He has taken heart in the book-keeping, and you
find by the tariff that you have been staying at a
first-class hotel, after all.
“Shipmate” : The British Board of Trade
has just announced a concession that is
loaded down to the Plimsoll with interest to
deep-sea Australians who earn their bread
upon the waters. It is over the sight tests,
about which storms have been howling for
years back —ever since they were brought
into force. These new tests, according to
the grumble of most mariners, were framed
by spectacled experts who wouldn’t know a
ship’s port light from its starboard liver,
and were overloaded with theoretical dun-
nage that was so much dead weight. The
greatest hardship was that a mate (say)
who had spent a lifetime at sea, had passed
the old tests, and been given his mate’s
ticket, and naturally concluded there was
nothing to stop him carrying on his career
aboard ship till Davy Jones hailed him, was
liable, when he went up to pass for his
master’s ticket, to fall down over the new
sight tests and bump the bottom out of his
sea career. If he couldn’t pass the new
truck he was politely told to hand
over his mate’s ticket and go to Sodom
and Gomorrah. Now, the Board of
Trade, after listening to gales and
cyclones of protests, has announced that in
future any officer who has passed the old
tests will not be asked, when he rolls up for
a fresh ticket, to pass the new. This is good
enough as far as it goes, and will be a de-
cided relief to plenty of officers who have de-
liberately held back from going up for exams,
qualifying them for a higher ticket; but it
leaves a curious state of affairs. In future,
the man who has to pass the new tests will
go on board ship and share duties with
other men who passed the old tests, but very
possibly could not pass the new\ Therefore
there are only two ways of looking at it—
either the new men have to pass a stiffer
test than there is any practical need for, or
the old men cannot pass a test which there
is practical need for. Which, as our old mate
Euclid would say, is absurd.
“Ivan” sends a postscript to the Francis
Conway biographies (B. 9 and 16/10/T3) :
Francis Conway, who kept Prahran’s oldest boot-
shop, was also the suburb’s most extraordinary land-
lord. He started buying Chapel-street land 40 years
ago, and he never raised the rent to an original
tenant or to one of that tenant’s children who car-
ried on the business. Needless to say he was popu-
lar in Chapel-street. Over and over again he refused
offers from outsiders of treble the rent his old ten-
ants were paying. One estate agent went into his
shop about two years ago and offered to double his
income if he had the letting of the shops. The old
man —he was then 84—replied: “You mind your
business. I’ll stick to mine. Clear out.” To one
tenant who had a run of bad luck he gave £5OO and
a receipt for three years over-due rent. Perhaps the
fact that Conway was the son of an Irish evicted
tenant had something to do with it.
The Sydney Historical Society lately had
news of two globe-trotting Australians.
Yemmerrawanyea, a Neutral Bay (Sydney)
tribesman, went to England with Governor
Phillip and died there. His lately-renovated
tombstone, in the parish churchyard at
Eltham, Kent, records: “In memory of
Yammerrawanyea, a native of N.S.W., who
died the 18th of May, 1794, in the 19th year
of his age.” Underneath is the representa-
tion of a boomerang. Another of Phillip’s
aides-de-camp was Bennillong, who hung on
to his billet until 1795, wdien he got full-up
of the effete ways of the British aristocracy,
kicked his belltopper into the Thames, and
came back to the simple life of ’bacca, rum
and ’possum.

Needs Zamßuk
THE. EVER-READY HEALER.
Every mother realises to-day that a handy pot of Zam-Buk is a
priceless boon. Zam-Buk is not only world-famous for its heal-
ing, soothing and germ-destroying qualities, but gives us for the
first time an ever-ready “first-aid,” uniting simplicity, effective-
ness and safetv.
Simplicity. Because it requires no previous preparation,
———— needs simply to be taken out of the pot
with the clean finger-end and rubbed gently over the cut or sore,
when the fine juices sink into the tiny pores in the skin and “get
at” the harmful germs that are lodging in the under-tissues.
Effective
Because Zam-Buk is prepared by methods en-
tirely different and ahead
ot mere ( ointments and cheap salves or
creams.” Because it is composed of pure
juices and oils, scientifically refined and skil-
fully combined. The uniform success of
Zam-Buk shows that the ideally effectice
balm has been discovered at last.
Safe
Because Zam-Buk’s active constitu-
tor ents contain no trace of rancid animal
lat, mineral irritant or poisonous acid. Because
Zam-Buk achieves its exceptional results
by methods quite different from fatty
ointments and cheap salves. Zam-Buk is
so pure that it suits the fraMist invalid
and the youngest babe. It is the one and
only Zam-Buk.
Daily mishaps make Zam-Buk
a daily need ; and its instant ap-
plication on cut, sprain or sore
is a sure safeguard against blood-
poisoning germ diseases and all
the common complications of ac-
cidents and skin diseases.
A MOTHER PRAISES ZAM-BUK.
Mrs. 8. M. Burgess, of 34- Cambridge
Street, Rozelle, Sydney, says: “ For
such injuries as cuts, abrasions and
festered sores, and for children who are
a'ways falling and hurting themselves,
Zam-Buk shcu d be kept on a handy shelf
in every home. For chapped hands and
cracked lips caused by the bitter, winter
winds. Zam-Buk is a splendid remedy.”
Zam-Buk Is invaluable
for eczema, ringworm,
scalp trouble, poisoned
wounds, piles ; and heals
cuts, burns, bruises,
scalds and scratches.
S-old by all chemists and
stores at 1/6 and 3/6
pot (contains 3 times 1/6).

THE.
QUESTION of the DAY.
The question* of to-day,
of to-morrow and of
every succeeding day is
HAVE YOU USED PEARS* SOAP ?
If you have not, you have not
done your duty by your skin and
complexion. If, on the other hand
—that is, on both hands, and on the
face, and on the skin generally —you
HAVE used PEARS, you can feel
happy, for you will have done the
best that possibly can be done tor
the skin’s health and beauty. There
can be no question about that.
PEARS has been making beautiful
complexions for nearly 120 years.
ARS
Matchless for the Complexion
A Philosophy of Kisses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A KISS is a delightful thing
In very many ways,
As simple as the piece of stiing
That ties a poet’s bays,
Or as the footprints of a king
In one of Snakspeare’s plays.
It is a profitable bliss
If properly employed—
A fact explorers often miss,
And thereby are annoyed—
The wholesome, young and useful kiss
’Twere wanton to avoid.
Let me explain just what I mean :
The night was very still,
I met somewhere a wandering queen
Who purposed me some ill;
I pointed out the sleeping sheen
Of moonlight on the hill.
The lady was exceeding cold —
She thought she hated me.
For various things she had been told,
And anyone could see
Hers was the sort of breast to hold
A lot of enmity.
But moonlight has a curious charm,
And e’er she could refuse,
I took her half-reluctant arm
And made her turn her shoes
And seek a seat remote and warm
That lovers often use.
Then I remarked in accents clear
That I should like to know
Upon the instant now and here
Why she disliked me so;
A little curl above her ear
Was floating to and fro.
She made some statements large and plain,
Strong statements full of spleen;
I had a touch of passing'pain
To hear her call me mean,
Untruthful, drunken, shameless, vain,
And all I might have been.
But both her lips were very red,
And such a night, was this
That not a single thing she said
Seemed very much amiss ;
I merely swiftly turned my head
And stole a pleasant kiss.
I took a second. Then she rose,
Her anger all iu flame ;
She tilted a disdainful nose,
And spoke her scorn and blame ;
But I was hardened, I suppose,
And did not feel much shame.
I said, “I like that little curl
Just underneath your hat.
It sets my inmost heart a-whirl
To see you look like that;
In fact, one seldom sees a girl
So well worth looking at.”
She threw me one dark, scornful look
And turned upon her heel;
Her anger all her shoulders shook,
Which made me rather feel
The simple kisses that I took
Were precious things to steal.
A moment as in doubt she stood,
Then sighed in heavy pain ;
On wrath and death she seemed to brood,
And with a fine disdain
She whispered merely, “What’s the good?”
And sat her down again.
I think I kissed her sixteen times
With some degree of haste.
I sorrowed somewhat for my crimes
But still enjoyed the taste;
For lips on lips make pleasant rhymes
Which poets should not waste.
And in the moonlight still and clear
We quite forgot our strife.
The little curl above her ear
With witchery was rife—
You seldom meet a girl as dear
As a forgiving wife.
And thus, absolved of all my sins,
With her I homeward stent
To where the bread my toiling wins
Is put to use or keot.
And where our nurnle-headed twins
In curtained darkness slept.
For kisses arc delightful things
In taste and shape and sound
As simple as the works and springs
That make a clock go round.
Or as the song a poet sings
When scratching for a pound.
N.S.W.
PAT O'MAORI.
My Financial Position.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BEFORE me as I write lie a number of
unpaid bills. Presently a fit of blue
rage will possess me, and I will stuff
them out of sight in the small brown kit bag
that yawns at my side through all the work-
ing hours and accompanies me to and from
the office Then I will take pencil and paper
and draw up a balance-sheet —salary on one
side and bills of the past, present and future
on the other. The bills always overpower
the salary and give me a blank feeling of
hopeless insolvency. I know what the result
will be before I star*-. Yet I must do it. I
have been doing it for years, and you can’t
break off a confirmed habit like that without
a severe struggle. I am not good at severe
struggles. As a cold matter of fact, I am
not any nearer actual stone-broken ness than
I was years ago. Never since I set up house
has a perspiring tradesman paid me an even-
ing ffisit to tell me that he really couldn’t
think of letting the account run any longer.
As for bailiffs! Well, I suppose there are
such tilings r but I have never seen them.
My horror of small debts is really a form of
cowardice —call it financial cowardice. That
smirking and apologetic appeal, “A chcqut-
will oblige,” is quite sufficient to drive me
into a panic. I cannot extract any satis-
faction from the implied compliment,
namely, that I have a cheque-book and a
bank account, and can free myself from the
shackles of debt at any moment by merely
scribbling on a slip of paper. I think my
alleged commercial experience is partly re-
sponsible for my financial cowardice. I know
it is responsible for the accursed balance-
sheet habit, and the even worse habit of
carefully folding and preserving these de-
pressing documents for future reference and
profanity. I secretly admire the cheerful
way the confirmed journalist or writer who
has never been immured in a commercial
office throws out and annihilates waste
paper, lie has never had to hunt through
sheaves of invoices for the missing letter or
note demanded by an exact boss, so that he
may contradict some other grand duke of
commerce, and prove beyond shadow of
doubt that the amount of 2s. 3sd. was paid
10 years ago. A few experiences of that
sort (and they are frequent enough in
offices) make a waste-paper miser of a
man. All Hades may hang on some uncon-
sidered scrap of figuring ; so he saves them
all.
In the days when I was going through the
commercial mill, I was stipendiary slave to
a boss who, in his worst moments (usually
after a disastrous Saturday at the races)
used to slap the fluttering ledger leaves with
the back of his be-ringed right hand and
cry shrilly that the people who owed him
money ought all to be in gaol. The stand-
ing instruction to the firm’s bad debt col-
lector (myself) was “Give him Hell!” It
was a nice sort of training for a nervous
and fairly conscientious boy with a morbid
horror of offending people—even when they
owed money. I know it is foolish, also
hideously unjust, but I always suspect that
my mild, polite creditors go on in private
exactly as that bygone boss used to do. I
guess it is an instance of how an early ex-
perience stamps itself on the youthful mind
and defy reason and experience to erase it.
I don’t know how many thousands of dun-
ning letters I sent out in those bygone days,
but there must have been snowdrifts of
them. They were all carefully graded as
regards ferocity and we fired them out
quite mechanically. They created about
as much stir as feathers cast into a river.
The bulk of the creditors received them
and threw them away without comment or
reply. But now and then some supersensi-
tive soul would come in looking agitated
and lodge a complaint with his payment.
I remember now that we used to be dis-
tressed and embarrassed by such exhibi-
tions of weakness over such a trifling mat-
ter as a dunning letter; it seemed to us
poor sportsmanship, or something of the
kind. The man who paid spot cash was
regarded gratefully—because spot cash was
very scarce in those days ; still we felt some
vague resentment against him for his evi-
dent unwillingness to linger on our books.
In business the cash customer gets the cold
politeness that is extended to the uncom-
fortable visitor who “won’t come in, thanks,”
and gabbles his message at the open door.
Remembering these things, I can see how
it is I long to be out of debt, instead of
taking it easy in the armchair of credit
like the notable insolvent who goes home in
my train. He is a splendid figure, that in-
solvent, and his motor-car is the best in the
suburb. He failed for some heroic sum,
and now he sits prosperously in the shadow
of his obligations and flaps his evening
paper in the faces of miserable, envious
wretches like myself, who scuffle about pay-
ing contemptible bills.
We moved the other day, and the domes-
tic paroxysm brought to light a grievous
collection of past balance-sheets —mute re-
cords of days when, so far as I could judge
from a sternly impartial view of my absurd
finances, I was absolutely ruined. I had
found them all before on other occasions,
had sighed over and d—d them —and then
put them carefully away for re-discovery.
But this time, by Heaven’s mercy, I found
strength to rend one of them —the notebook
in which, during the three months preceding
my marriage, I forecasted, with the accu-
racy of financial despair, every minute ex-
pense incidental to the great and holy step.
It would not be fair to detail it here, be-
cause young wives regard all such experi-
ences with the soft eye of sentiment. If
challenged, they assert they would like to
be married all over again. But ask the
husband —-the one who was casting up the
interminable accounts on the honeymoon
beach and wondering if the cash would last
out, while his bride was rhapsodising. See
if he wants to finance and be honorary trea-
surer of another romance! Not unless he
is a courageous and cheerful ower. Unless
he has a comfortable cash margin, the new
husband, much as he may love his wife,
can’t help thinking long, sad thoughts of
the probable charges of some future cabman
or luggage juggler. I can see nothing funny
in these comic portraits of wedding groups
with, the bride, a self-conscious mass of
white clothes, and the bridegroom, a sternly
resolute frock-coated figure in the back-
ground. He always looks as if he had been
worrying, and so he has—over houses, and
furniture and immense problems of the sort
right down the scale of expenses to that last
blithersome item —the verger’s tip.
The night before my wedding I strewed
the poor remnants of my bank account on
the table and asked the best man. who was
glumly watching me pack, what he thought
would be a fair thing to give the verger.
After a brief and profane discussion, we
unanimously decided that 5s. — (SHAME)
-—would be quite enough. I would have
made it more, had I dared ; but it seemed
to me that the difference between ss. and
20s. (that is to say, the difference between
a verger’s contempt and respect) might,
later on. leave me owing money to someone
who had really earned it. So I gave the
doubtful best man ss. fur the verger, and
next day, after the ceremony was over, he
bravely shoved the disgraceful sum into the
functionary’s hand and hurried away be-
fore he had time to sort out his emotions.
Even now I have no idea wlia! he expected
to receive for wafting himself round, and
walking solemnly before, and lingering
watchfully in the offing; but, whatever it
was. it must have been more than he got.
Well, confound him, I worried over his :>b-
surd fee for days before he got it, and even
now I have occasional conscience pangs and
wonder if it would be worth while sending
him a few more shillings anonymously
(Continued on next paye.)


ARE YOUR KIDNEYS WEAK?
Weak Kidneys Cause Backache, Gravel, Urinary
Disorders, Dropsy, Lumbago and Rheumatism.
Every moment of your life, poisonous waste keeps
getting into the blood from your food, and from the
wear and tear of the body. But the kidneys filter it
out and keep the blood pure.
But when the kidneys are weak, they cannot do
their work thoroughly. Then some of the poisonous
waste gets left in the blood, and you begin to feel
dull, heavy and drowsy ; your back is bad, your head
aches; dropsical swellings appear in the ankles or
under the eyes, and the heart becomes affected. You
may get rheumatic twinges, lumbago attacks, or dizzy
spells. The bladder acts too often, or there is pain
in seeking relief. There may be sediment, gravel, or
cloudiness of the water.
When the kidneys are ill they need a kidney medi-
cine—ordinary medicines won’t do —they cannot
cleanse and relieve the kidneys. Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills act quickly and directly upon the
kidneys and bladder—help the kidneys to filter the
mischievous kidney poisons out of the blood and
dispose of them through the urinary system. Doan’s
Pills give the best results of any kidney medicine
known.

SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
from camperdo wn. j
Mrs. E. Furness, No. 1 McLaughlin Terrace, Church
Street, Camperdown, Sydney, says: “For years I was
martyr to severe backache and other distressing symptoms
of Kidney trouble. The pain in my back was awful,
especially if I had to do any stooping or move about quickly.
It seemed to centre just above the kidneys, and never left
me, day or night. My secretions were much affected, being
thick and cloudy, and I always felt tired and had no energy
for anything. I tried all sorts of medicines, but it was not
until 1 had been using Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills for a
day or so that I got any relief from my suffering. These
pills were recommended to me, and proved to be the very
thing I wanted. Before I had finished one bottle I felt
very much better, and by the time I had used four bottles
of the pills the pain in my back had gone, and I was quite
well again. Over six months have elapsed since my cure
was effected, and I have been free of every symptom of
kidney trouble ever since. I now feel a different woman,
thanks to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
| FROM CROYDON. "|
Mr. Charles Merrill, Kyarra, Davis Street, Croydon,
Sydney, late of Lithgow, says: “For many years I was
employed in the ironworks at Eskbank. and 1 was often put
on filling the skips with coal. In this work there is almost
continual stooping, and after a while I began to get nasty
pains in the small of my back. At first I thought they
might be caused by fatigue, but they continued and grew
worse. They troubled me also a good deal at night when
in bed, as if there w r as something hard gripping my kidneys.
-Mjßt ers looked pretty serious, so I commenced trying
different remedies. I did not meet with any success until
I saw Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills advertised, and sent
for some. They have given me splendid relief; I can now
work with ease, and am quite free of backache.”
Twelve years later, Mr. Merrill says: “Twelve years is a
long spell, but time has made no difference in my cure. I
am still absolutely free of backache. That is a good record,
and proves that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are a gen-
uinely good remedy.”

through the post. But he may have given
up verging now, and been transformed into
a lay reader or a curate.
The so-called “artistic temperament”—
that is, the temperament which leaves
things lying round anyhow, while the pic-
ture is being painted or the article written
—is very comfortable, and the tidy com-
mercial temperament is admirable in many
ways ; _ but an accidental mixture whereby
you miss the benefits of both isn’t satisfac-
tory. I have got that mixture. Commerce
taught me how to get out depressing balance-
sheets and hoard them. But I never acquired
the commercial knack of hanging on to
money and making it make more money;
and I never mastered the fine intricacies of
Tick. I can only stand off and admire the
poet who laughingly showed me a summons
for groceries stuck carelessly and contempt-
uously on a nail. And I have nothing but
wonder for the tale which tells how a well-
known artist used to let his milkman’s bill
get up to £5O, and, when the wretched
tradesman called, used to shake him warmly
by the hand, give him whisky and an arm-
chair, and tell him freely and frankly that
he ‘had nothing—ab-sol-utely nothing! If
you doubt me, ask Mrs. Paintbox there. She
will tell you that there isn’t a shilling in
the place. Is there, my dear?” And “my
dear” would corroborate every word, and
the milkman would glumly accept another
whisky ( that was somebody else’s trouble)
depart like a cow in a dream.
Now Christmas is upon me—Christmas,
the alleged time of good cheer and presents.
I never have any money to buy presents;
kut I do—and I put them all down on the
Christmas balance-sheet and make it a
document of despair. In the trunk that
holds my rubbish, the Christmas balance-
sheets are the prize depressing items. There
are illuminating marginal remarks in pen-
cil such as, “Buy brooch and owe tailor,”
, Too much—ask B. for a cheaper bangle,”
Get book instead of this.” I hate this
miserable side-stepping; but it has to be
done. I have always found it profitable to
get the wife to buy the Christmas presents
for other women and children. A man
always goes out and buys something expen-
sive and (more or less) useful. But with
all his profanity and extravagance he never
scores the splendid successes his wife does
with some trifling and generally contemot-
lble scrap of rag that will last at most about
one week. To a man it looks just a flutter-
ins: insult; but it is invariably “just what I
wanted!” Men haven’t got that fine in-
stinct for rags ; it is doubtful if even drapers
. ? 1 have an idea that a woman will
gleefully accept from another woman small,
cheap gifts that would bring a man nothing
but cold contempt. I cannot imagine any
able-bodied male winning applause from a
female relation at Christmas with a six-
penny handkerchief and a demented scran
of lace. A shameless softgoods traveller with
a. new line of cotton stockings to push may
distribute a few pairs amongst his relatives
or the inmates of his boarding-house without
losing prestige; but softgoods travellers can
do things that ordinary laymen dare not
attempt. I remember an abject jobbing
gardener (he was a partially reformed
Domamiac) who used to infest the garden
of a friend’s house and whine at the back
door for food like a new sort of upright dog.
One Christmas lie ventured very humbly to
present the lady of the house with a six-
penny handkerchief. It must have repre-
sented a lot of self-denial and deep thought:
but, ever afterwards, when he appeared at
the back door in search of food, the cook
grinned idiotically, and the housemaid had
to stuff her handkerchief into her mouth and
rush from the scene, while smothered
shrieks of delight would be heard within
doors where “the mistress” dwelt. The
poor wretch’s one experiment in cheap
present-giving caused so much mirth that he
eventually ceased giving careful imitations
of a man working in a garden and fawned
elsewhere for his food. No, even the most
hard-up man cannot afford to give cheaply.
But if he has a wife she can do it for him.
In my Christmas balance-sheet there are
two entries, (a) Wife’s present £3, (6)
presents for F, L, G, S and T (all female
relations), £l. It isn’t what you might call
an equitable distribution; but I suppose she
deserves something extra for having actually
married me. It’s easy enough to be a
female relation.
Well, Christmas is here again, and I sup-
pose I’ll have to put up with it. I hope I
don’t get any ties that are absolutely pain-
ful to witness in a mirror. If I might
express my views, I would prefer my pre-
sents to be of the unwearable sort" that
can be left at home without bringing down
reproaches. There used to be a diabolically
small silver matchbox which contained a
whole dozen matches (when carefully
loaded), and now and then snapped on a
match-head and blazed up. It encumbered
my watch chain and embittered my whole
existence in a small, frittering way until
my,wife took nossession and added it to the
curious savage collection of silver she calls
her chatelaine and dangles from her waist-
belt. I hate the opulent jangle of that chat-
elaine. It suggests a richly-laden caravan
ot camels coming home across the desert,
whereas it is as valueless as a string of
iam tins and a mere advance warning that
I am about to be bushranged for another
half-crown for tramfares and afternoon tea
I d like to know who first got off that gag
about two living cheaper than one. If he
wasn’t a fool bachelor with a sprouting
moustache, he must have been a savage
humorist with 10 children,. I wouldn’t
mind the loss of that half-crown so much,
only it brings up the expenditure side of
my last balance-sheet from £9 18s. 3d. to
£lO Os. 9d. Let’s see now ! If I leave that
baker’s account over till next week

Straight Trees.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YOL see,” said the axeman thought-
fully, “it’s the straight tree as does
the mischief. Every tree has got
to fall, and the great thing is to know what
it’s likely to do. Some has a kink to the
north, some to the south ; some bows to the
east like that blighted Parsee hawker who
was here last week. All of these trees a
man can understand and guard against. But
it s the upright beggars that do the mischief
unless you’re an old hand that understands
the game. There they stand leaning neither
to right nor to left, waiting for a breeze to
topple ’em any way, and many a new hand
has lost the number of his mess because a
tree couldn’t make up its mind where it
would kiss its mother when it touched her.
Nothin is so treacherous as your upright
tree. Never yet saw r a man hurt by a tree
with a good lean —but these perpendicular
hypocritical vegetables lay out some poor
fellow every day. T’other day I see poor
young Greenhorn chopping away at a
beauty. Along comes Smithers, a poor old
hatt r from Binger’s Gully, and Greenhorn
calls out, “Get away, you fool! She may
fall any minute and I’m damned if I know
how. The wind blew in little gusts, and
Smithers, in trying to run, catches his foot
in a vine and trips. Poor Greenhorn, a
plucky, big-hearted beggar, runs to help him
up and away, and as he pushes the old
cove safe out o’ the road down comes the
straight un and flattens him. . . .For pure,
vicious, wilful homicide you can’t beat a
nice upright eucalyptus.”... .The axeman
paused. “Just the same with human bein’s.
If a man’s given to drink you know what to
do with him. Shepherd him at the pubs.
It he has to pass a night in a shanty look
after his money and don’t fire his blood by
asking him to drink. If he’s fond of a
gamble don’t be such an ass as to lend him
money, and if he has a weakness for petti-
coats give him the tip about the sort of
scarlet iniquity that little Bella with the
black eyes has been as long as she’s been
starring as Delilah in this part of creation.
But then there’s the Straight Cove who
doesn't booze, who won’t gamble, and who
looks as innocent with girls as a baa-lamb,
.there was a big, brown-haired, blue-eyed
young fellow with us once who just filled
the bill for Innocence. Wouldn’t lush;
never touched a card ; kept away from the
wild girls in Timberton. We’d have staked
our last cent on him as the pure-bred clean
merino. We called him Billy the Bud.
Just a quarter of a mile off our camp
ayed Joe McGuire, the railway ganger.
Sheepish sort of chap was Joe, and clean
dotty on his wife, who was a fair clinker.
Straight, tall, hair raven black, olive com-
plected, with a pair of black eyes that
would burn holes in a blanket. Half the
chaps in our camp were shook on her and
would make all sorts of excuses to call round
at McGuire’s with a melon for Joe or a
pineapple, or something else of the kind....
All of a sudden the woman disappeared
and poor McGuire went off his head at the
Joss of her. Our camp broke up a few weeks
later, all the decent pine in that section
being cut out, and I left for Melbourne.
Six weeks later, walking down Colli ns-
streeG who should I meet but Mistress
McGmre fresh as a daisy, walking along
beside Billy (he Bud, and he looking at her
as proud as ninepence—the one man in n,

The Maitland Road.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A LONG the road to Maitland town,
An ’ you will walk with me,'
A heart as light as thistle-down
Your heart, my love, shall be;
For every bush—green bush and brown- i
Shall thrill with minstrelsy.
The road is long, the road is white,
A careless road it seems—
A hollow here, and there a height,
And yon a scene of dreams,
Where—lucerne flats to left and right—
The Hunter River gleams
The courting birds are thrilling all
The noon with melodies;
M ith feathered throats grown musical
And love upon the breeze—
Who knows what good things shall befall
Our hearts —what ecstasies?
M ith every league a golden span,
And all the wayside gay
We shall forget the cares of man
That turn the noontide grey;
No more the sport of trouble than
Red cattle by the way.
Then up and out, and don your cloak—
Rich scarlet you shall wear ;
The country folk are simple folk,
And twice or thrice, I swear,
They’ll turn and twist, and gasp, and
choke
To see a face so fair.
There shall not be a man of them
But he shall envy show ;
Belike, a rich rose on its stem
Whence fragrant odors flow,
Or some red radiant ruby-gem—
He’ll deem you, eyes aglow.
And every bird that we behold
Shall sing with sweeter stress
For having seen a twain so bold
Who love and laugh no less
For that they boast not minted gold,
Nor gems from Heathenesse.
Then get you ready speedily
In scarlet cloak and gown,
And you shall see what you shall see
Ere yet the sun falls down,
When, having fared through Arcady.
We come to Maitland town.

it. It s designed for maximum production on both hard 'and soft
woods, and secures you a bigger return without any increase on
overhead ex’s. W rite tour “Waterous” expert for details. He’s
