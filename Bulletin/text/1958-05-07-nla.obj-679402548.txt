THE UNBANNED BOOKS
Senator Henty’s announcement of
the revised list of books banned by
the Customs Department has been
received by the world in a strange
silence.
There has been (up to the time of
writing) an almost complete absence
of editorial comment in the Sydney
papers. “Pro Bono Publico” from
Pymble and “Indignant” from Glades-
ville have been equally mute.
No excited telegrams, no loud and
prolonged cheering came from the
Fellowship of Writers. Nobody even
bothered to ring-up Norman Lindsay
and ask him how he felt about Redheap
being liberated at last.
And yet, when you look at the list
and compare it with the highly-secret
list of banned books which “The
Bulletin,” acquiring it by means too
devious to be mentioned, published in
1946, it appears that the Literature
Censorship Board has done some really
good deeds.
It would seem that no fewer than
four of Norman Lindsay’s books have
come off the list: not only Redheap,
which everybody knows about, or used
to, that delightful comedy of small-
town life in Victoria, but also a slighter
comedy. The Cautious Amorist ; and
—incredible to think that they could
ever have been banned —the two
editions of Petronius, one translated by
Jack Lindsay and the other by W. C.
Firebaugh, Norman Lindsay’s illustra-
tions to which are rated by many con-
noisseurs as the highwater-mark of his
craftsmanship in black-and-white.
One must be careful here not to do
too much justice to the present Censor-
ship Board, and some corresponding
injustice to its predecessors. “The
Bulletin” acquired its secret list of
banned books some years before it
published it; and it is possible that the
Petronius editions were released either
before 1946 or at some unknown date
before the present revision. Certainly
you never had any trouble in buying
them, secondhand, in the bookshops:
as with so many other books that some-
body had banned some time and then
either released or forgotten about.
But Redheap and The Cautious
Amorist certainly appear to be new
releases. And so must be some of these
books that were on the previous list
and now have disappeared from it:—
All Men are Enemies by Richard
Aldington; Apples Be Ripe by
Llewelyn Powys; Bessie Cotter by
Wallace Smith: The Bishop’s Jaegers
by Thorne Smith; The Colonel’s
Daughter by Richard Aldington; The
Gentle Libertine by Colette (imagine
banning Colette!); The Glorious Pool
by Thorne Smith; The Love Books of
Ovid, translated by J. Lewis May;
Nineteen Nineteen by John Dos Passos;
another Petronius item. The Satyricon,
“translation attributed to Oscar
Wilde”; Rabelais, “works of; cheap
paper-covered editions only”; The
Story of Venus and Tannhauser, illus-
trated by Aubrey Beardsley; and Turn-
about by Thorne Smith.
As I say, such is the secrecy with
which censorship in the past has been
conducted, and such is the obscurity
surrounding the present announcement,
no one can be sure precisely when all
of these books were released. I doubt
if the N department itself knows. I have
omitted from the list such titles as
Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World,
Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms,
Defoe’s Moll Flanders and Joyce's
Ulysses (which once made a Customs
Minister’s hair stand on end) because
I am fairly sure—and quite sure in
some cases—that these were released
years ago: and I have also omitted
Radcliffe Hall’s Well of Loneliness, The
Golden Ass of Apuleius. Aldington’s
Death of a Hero and Erskine Cald-
well’s Tobacco Road because Sydney
“Sun” in 1946 managed to discover by
some dark process that these books
had by then been released.
With these —and probably some later
bannings—released, the question is,
then, what books remain banned?
Sydney “Herald,” I must say, con-
siderably startled the town by stating,
in its brief analysis of the new list, that
the Decameron was on it. But that was
a mistake. A more careful examination
of the list discloses that what is banned
is not the Decameron in any of the
standard editions (which so annoyingly
leave one of the most amusing stories
in Italian) but a special edition of
Ten Tales from the Decameron, illus-
trated by Edmonds Lucchesi: I fear it
must be naughty.
Though I am sorry to be deprived of
The Limerick: 1700 Examples with
Notes, Variations and Index (would
that be the one Norman Douglas is
supposed to have edited?), and I admit
to some dim curiosity about The Secret
Diaries of Eva Braun, there seem on
the whole very few bannings one could
question. The E’s make a fair sample,
and the whole list goes on like that: —
Eastern Love, English versions of
the Kuttanimatam of Damoclara-
gupta and Samayamatrika o f
Kshmendra, by E. Powys Mathers ;
Ecole de L’amour, L’; L’Art
d’amour; L’Art de Seduire les
Femmes, by Dr. Verdier ; Edmonde
Seduite, by P. de la Batut; Enthullte
Gehcimnisse der Liebe und Erotik,
by Rolf Verthen; Erotikens Historia
I Europea, by Paul Englisch;
Erotische Liebespielen, by Amar
Amarus; Eselava de la Lujuria
(Anon.); Ethik der NackheU, by
Fernand D o u g e r ; Entretiens
Perverses by Flora (Pseud.); Ex
Husband (Anon.).
In fact, unless there are scientific
works in it which I know nothing
about, the only item that might still
seriously be challenged seems to be
Lady Chatteriey’s Lover (“excluding
the expurgated editions”).
But if that —and admittedly a con-
tentious one—is the only case to argue.
Australian censorship is at the moment
in a most happy position. And. subject
to human frailty, there is every chance
of its remaining so. for not only are
all new bannings to be openly pub-
lished in the “Government Gazette” but
also there is provision for the list to be
revised every five years. Any new
Redheap that happens to be banned
should not have to wait 28 years for
a foolish decision to be reversed.
The one outstanding injustice that
remains to be remedied, that of the ban
on Lawson Glassop’s We Were the
Rats, is. unfortunately, one that the
Commonwealth can’t touch. It was
banned, in New South Wales alone, by
prosecution. But it could now be
reprinted overseas and admitted by the
Customs, conceivably to circulate freely
in all States except New South Wales.
Certainly, with its present enlightened
outlook on literature, which is no doubt
inspired by the Prime Minister, the
Customs couldn’t possibly ban it. And
the really important thing, with such
vital Australian novels as Redheap and
We Were the Rats, is not merely to
remove them from the list of banned
books but to get them into print again.

CORAL SEA REFLECTIONS
THE Coral Sea Battle, the anniversary
of which is being celebrated this week
with United States official visitors
present in force and a modern United
States cruiser in Sydney Harbour, has
acquired in Australia something of the
same symbolism in relation to World
War II as Gallipoli had in relation to
World War I.
It had more than that. It represented
not merely an event in Australian and
Pacific war history, but the passing of
an old era of weaponry and tactics and
the beginning of a new one.
With it went out the age of the big
gun as the decisive weapon in sea-
warfare. though the heavy, long-range
gun still had its vital role in landing-
operations and in those phases of war-
fare in which it was inevitable at that
time that ships should come to close-
quarters.
There were three battles which were
vitally important to modern naval
history, and which had historic effects,
all fought within a period of three
months towards the middle of 1942. at
a time when, to the man-in-the-street,
the Japanese appeared to be making a
completely victorious advance against
main objectives, of which Australia was
supposed to be one, though it was not.
The first was the battle of the Bay of
Bengal, when for the first time the
Japanese advance was stemmed. This
was fought by old-fashioned methods
by British Royal Navy cruisers and
aircraft from Ceylon and prevented the
enemy from penetrating to the Indian
coast by sea and establishing control
of the Indian Ocean trade-routes.'
Then came the Coral Sea engagement,
which is popularly supposed to have
prevented the invasion of Australia.
In fact, the Japanese had no intention
of invading, at least until they had
beaten America and ourselves. They
merely envisaged the establishment of
a powerful cordon round South-east
Asia, running, on the southern side,
from a bastion in the Gilbert Islands
round the south of Indonesia to India.
The Coral Sea Battle resulted from
a major attempt to take a force to Port
Moresby to establish there one of the
key-posts or main forts of the bastion.
The third battle of the series took
place in the first week in June off Mid-
way Island, and its decisive results were
such as to send the enemy on to the
defensive permanently and to assure
his military thinkers that the war was
lost, however long they might hold-out.
This Japanese war-historians admit
frankly.
It is, however, no wonder that the
general attitude of Australians to the
Coral Sea Battle is based on the
erroneous conception that it saved
Australia from imminent attack. The
Government of the day did everything
to foster this idea. But in actual fact
the American plans to use Australia
as a base were matured long before.
Moreover, the battle was fought
within air-range of the Queensland
coast. It was "the first battle of great
magnitude fought in the South-west
Pacific. And while there was no real
danger that it would be followed by
invasion, it was conceivable that part
of the Japanese operations might have
included a blast to render useless aero-
dromes and military installations in
North Queensland.
The real significance of the battle,
however, lies in the fact that it was
revolutionary in method, if not in basic
tactics. And it is a strange paradox
that in it the techniques which began
the swift revolution in naval ships,
fleet-methods, weapons, tactics and
strategy should have been first exhibited
in the seas remotest from the great
fleet-bases and centres of conflict in
the world.
What was new particularly was the
weaponry and its method of use. For
it was the first time that ships had
fought each other more than a hundred
miles apart, at a minimum, and far out
of range of each other’s guns. It was,
in fact, the first real major battle of
aircraft-carriers, which began to raise
the carrier from its old primary role
of reconnaissance, with secondary
offensive and defensive functions, to
that of battleships of the line which
“fired” aircraft instead of shells in main
battle.
Regarded from the eminence of 17
years later it seems a rather elementary
operation between forces of light fire-
power with limited range. The interval
has seen the disappearance of the
battleship with its heavy armor and big
guns, the disappearance of the old-
type-loading cruiser-guns and with
them the old type of cruiser; also the
increase of the range of the marine air-
craft and of its hitting-power, which,
per machine, is now more lethal than
that of a whole six-inch-gun cruiser of
the 1940 era. It ushered-in a complete
change in the role of the aircraft-
carrier, which has taken the place of the
battleship, and a devastating revision in
methods of reconnaissance, in which
radar has replaced both Nelson’s
frigates and the flying-boats and the
carrier-borne aircraft of the last war.
Moreover, this year's celebrations see
the beginning of the exit of the large
carriers, save as the basic units of land-
ing attack commando-forces, and the
entry of the submarine of unlimited
range and size, atomic-powered as the
potential battleship of the near future.
The 16-inch gun with a metric-ton
shell travelling at the rate of 2650 ft. a
second and a muzzle-energy of a mere
97.000 foot-tons has given way to the
guided missile which travels at speeds
in the order of 3500 miles an hour,
with a range of 1500 miles, and which
is armed with a nuclear warhead of
megaton—a million tons of T.N.T. —
power.
Whereas at the time of the Coral Sea
affair the world was feverishly building
giant battleships to replace the losses
of Pearl Harbor and the Mediterranean,
this past year has seen the exit of the
last two giants, the Vanguard in the
Royal Navy and the Wisconsin from
the U.S. Navy, from active service.
Either of them could well fall a wreck
before the onslaught of one modern
destroyer or submarine or a single air-
craft.
The emphasis in ships is now on the
submarine and the submarine-hunter,
on the long-range marine aircraft and
on the commando-carrier, which may
have only an ephemeral career, and its
servant the up-and-coming helicopter,
and aircraft capable of vertical ascent.
Radar and guided rocket-missiles are
queens of the air.
If there is any outstanding signifi-
cance in the Coral Sea anniversary for
Australia it lies in the swiftness with
which techniques have advanced and
in the widening of the distances over
which an enemy might strike at us.
It also lies in the fact that by modern
standards we are, at the moment,
virtually bare of deterrent defence
against long-range onslaught - as
naked as a newborn babe to the
modern savagery of the guided weapon
and the world-range submarine.

" HOW?"


PLAIN ENGLISH
Nasser
[By “One Spur"]
Until the horse was completely banished
from the battlefield it was corporals who
used to cause most of the trouble in the
world. The Little Corporal stamped all
over Europe, and, at the very end of
that era, Corporal Hitler followed his
example. Even that great and enlightened
commander, the first Duke of Marl-
borough, took as his favorite nickname
that of “Corporal John.”
In those days leading soldiers was
still an aristocratic prerogative, and the
corporal's good democratic title, with its
implication of steadiness and skill-at-
arms, appealed to the limited imagination
of the files.
Then to call an officer “ambitious”
was to damn him as an outsider. All
that the ordinary regimental officer in
any army ever hoped to do was to be
lucky enough to survive to command his
regiment and, if possible, lead it in
battle. When this simple aspiration was
fulfilled he was content to retire from
public duty, respected by his country
until the iconoclastic age of “Colonel
Blimp.”
But now, since soldiering has become
a business instead of a vocation and
armies democratic, the troublemakers of
the world have been promoted to lieu-
tenant-colonels. Examples of this ten-
dency may be found in Thailand, Indo-
nesia and elsewhere. (South America has
always been the hotbed.) It is difficult
to find any reason for this, except that
officers have become ambitious; so
lieutenant-colonels, coveting their red
hats, have put themselves into the
category of the baronet, cynically defined
as being “no longer a gentleman but not
quite a peer.” Frustration, perhaps, has
sparked-off mutinous and political
action.
The doyen of these political lieutenant-
colonels is Gamal Abdel Nasser,
President and dictator of Egypt, with
Syria firmly under his control as part
of the United Arab Republic, and Yemen
his satellite. A young man still, aged
only 40, he has sprung up in six years
from obscurity to the position of
acknowledged leader of the Levant.
His technical capacity as an officer
is hard to compute. Ordinarily Egyptians
do not shine in command in the field, and,
although Nasser fought in the first cam-
paign against Israel and was wounded
there, no record is at hand which shows
his prowess.
He is certainly a good learner, as the
writer of this item knows from having
taught him certain functions of the
British staff. If it were possible to com-
pose a fair confidential report on an
officer of whom one had had inter-
mittent knowledge only for three weeks
and then simply as a student, the answer
would be —“a keen and painstaking
officer who asks questions that are
usually to the point ; he was the leader
in his particular batch ; inclined to be
cheeky, but responds to firm manage-
ment.”
But this, mark you, is not judging him
technically as a fighting-officer, purely
as a staff-wallah. And this was Nasser
seven years ago.
Still, it may give some clue to those
who understand to say that, at that time
and in his batch, Nasser was the one who
might have been chosen as staff-officer
rather than as battalion-commander.
This is the judgment of a simple soldier.
Remember that the Arabs are simple
soldiers, too.
Nasser does not play that game now.
He is on the political bandwagon. How
much hope has the ordinary modern
officer, even staff-trained, of understand-
ing the intrigues of Realpolitik ? Very
little, one would say, particularly
remembering that Nasser relies on the
emotions rather than on reason for his
politics. He admits himself that he
follows the stream, trying to canalise it
into a flow which will help the Arab
world to find a leader for its aspirations.
The leader he envisages is Nasser. But
it might be pertinent here to remark that
Nasser is not an Arab but an Egyptian.
There is some difference between the
man painted here and him who wrote:
Deserts, the dawn and the destriers I
ken,
And the glaive and the guest and the
paper and pen.
(if a translation which gives nothing but
the thought and alliteration may be
excused).
Lieutenant-Colonel Nasser has gone to
Moscow. Well, let him remember that
the Little Corporal went to Moscow, too.
TV Political Personalities
Easily the most compelling personality
to emerge in television in Melbourne is
the same old The Trump. The Prime
Minister in his TV-debut in “Meet the
Press” on HSV7 must have heartened his
party considerably, since TV probably
will become more and more important
politically.
He has lost weight, and the TV-make-
up ironed-out the wrinkles of statecraft
and complimented his silver hair; more-
over, his technique, like his platform-
manner, was urbane and persuasive, and
he looked his questioner in the eye
physically, if many of his replies didn’t.
Of the political personalities on TV in
Melboufipe, Calwell and John Galbally
probably have been nearest to the P.M.
Calwell was able to get in some telling
jibes without losing his temper —without,
indeed, raising his voice—and Galbally
emerged very well from the only real
roughhouse so far in “Meet the Press,”
still smiling and good-tempered. Casey
looks good, but, like the Doc., is a little
long-winded for television.
The Prime Minister was treated per-
haps a little considerately by the press
panel, probably because of his high office,
and they accepted almost all his replies
without demur. An obvious one-two
would have been his complaint in Sydney
about the aggregation of power in Can-
berra in contrast to Canberra’s
attitude to power in the Northern
Territory.
Considering his ability to give and
take at any level, even in the Eddie Ward
basement, this was a mistake, and it may
now be December before politics become
excitingly visible in thousands of houses
where they now are never mentioned.
The Champion
The spectacle of Dr. Evatt in the role
of the champion of freedom of speech
should give the gods—at least the Red
gods—a good hearty laugh.
He is trying to make a national issue
of the fact that, at the moment when
the United Kingdom had taken steps
to invade the Suez area to protect its
large interests there and Australia’s sea-
communication line with Europe, the
A.B.C. objected to a journalist opening
his script with the sentence: “So, at this
hour, Britain is at war, and without any
doubt is regarded throughout most of
the world as an aggressor,” following
this up with:
It seems incredible, even a little shatter-
ing. No one can read with much pride
or pleasure of R.A.F. bombs crashing on
Egyptian centres. Still less of Egyptian
civilians being killed merely because they
are in some proximity to military instal-
lations or airports.
And further:
Over the decision [to attack Egypt], its
planning and its timing, hangs an un-
pleasant scent.—or should I say stench —
of ruthless opportunism. Ideals to which
Britain has firmly adhered in post-war
years have been scattered to the winds.
The United Nations has been dealt a cruel
kick in the stomach. The newly-freed
nations of Africa and Asia have been out-
raged as the clamor of their protests,
just beginning to flow across the world
cables, makes clear.
However misguided the British action,
it was designed to come between two
combatants and save a communication-
route and vast defence-installations, in
which Australia, like the United King-
dom and the rest of the Western world,
had a vital defence interest, from falling
entirely into the hands of an adventurer
who was already flirting with Russia.
This seems to have given the A.B.C. a
good deal of basis to object.
Moreover, if Britain was at war, and
it was obvious that the A.B.C. would be
considered as an agency of the British
Commonwealth in such a case, it was
clear that it had a duty not to allow
anything to be said at that premature
stage which would be irresponsible or
tend to compromise its position or that
of the country.
Of course, if Mr. Rohan Rivett, the
A.B.C. commentator, had been a
Hungarian or Czech or an Egyptian and
he had turned on his national bloc in
the manner of his broadcast, he would
probably have found himself in his grave
or on his way to Siberia a few hours
afterwards, and then there would have
been no protest from Dr. Evatt —or
rather, no Dr. Evatt to protest.
The main issue, however, is one of
consistency. Dr. Evatt denounced the
unfortunate Sydney “Australia First” men
who were interned and ruined under his
regime during the war as “undoubtedly
a Quisling, subversive, anti-Australian


and anti-British group” on no other evi-
dence than they had called for friendly
relations with Japan years before the
war, had criticised the British Navy’s
efficiency early in the war, and had called
for a national Government, courageous
war-leadership, and inquiry into Minis-
terial responsibility for the failure of the
Government to defend Rabaul after war
with Japan had broken-out.
An examination of the censorship
during Dr. Evatt’s period of rule and of
the intimidation of those opposed to the
extreme Leftist viewpoint at that time
would provide a revealing addendum to
Dr. Evatt’s sudden indignation about the
A.B.C.’s alleged suppressions.
His indignations always seem to flower
when something has interfered with
Communist world interests. Moscow
would have relished the Rivett broadcast.
It suited its purposes exactly, especially
since Mr. Menzies was giving the U.K.
support and at the same time financing
the A.B.C.
United Europe Plans
The plan for Western European arma-
ment adopted lately represents an
important step.
The plan is British, and it is a
striking illustration of the manner in
which the lions and lambs of yesterday
have begun to produce a new composite
Europe. Already the working of the
coal-and-steel community has shown that
the impossible is possible, with six
countries operating in unity under an
Assembly of 78 members drawn from
national Parliaments of France, Germany
and Italy (18 each), Belgium and Nether-
lands (10 each) and four from Luxem-
bourg.
This body has its own High Authority,
or executive, a large consultative com-
mittee and its own Court of Justice.
It established its common market for
coal, iron-ore and scrap on May 1, 1953,
and for steel on August 1, 1954. It
entered into a formal association for joint
consultation with the United Kingdom in
September, 1955.
The new arms scheme includes pro-
posals for joint building of submarines
and anti-submarine equipment by seven
Governments of the Western European
Union Powers the U.K., France,
Germany, Italy and Benelux, to insure
standardisation for the Baltic, Medi-
terranean and North Sea. The other
plans cover radar, guided- and
ballistic-missiles of all types, tanks,
jet-engines, a new-model machine-
gun of high velocity and tremendous fire-
power. For the time being nuclear
weapons are excluded, but they must be
included when the scheme comes to full
fruition.
The continuous rise in cost of defence-
production has been forcing develop-
ment towards the present type of planning
for some time.
The Governments concerned formally
agreed to the plan on April 17, and
within two months the experts of the
participants in the Western European
Union are expected to have worked-out
the idea in detail to the point at which
it should begin to function.
It is a matter in which Australia must
have the closest interest from the begin-
ning, particularly in view of its associa-
tion with the United Kingdom in
Woomera and because deterrent defence
must be long-range defence, a fact
which is likely to make European
weaponing more suitable for Australian
purposes than at any previous time
during the present century.
Sydney's Own Regiment
May 3 was chosen as the day for the
Army to change from summer- to
winter-dress, and also for the review of
the Ist Infantry Battalion (Commando),
the City of Sydney’s Own Regiment.
Everyone sweltered in the hot sun ;
but the heart of any soldier watching the
parade went out to those who were
taking part in it.
All ranks moved with soldierly
precision, and Major “Mac” Grant
deserved congratulation on his command.
As one would expect with Sydney’s own
regiment, there were Macarthur-Onslows
there —one as honorary colonel, the other
as second-in-command.
The Governor-General took the salute
and looked and spoke like a soldier. He
gave praise, which is long overdue, to
the citizen-soldier who does his soldiering
in his own spare-time and often at his
own expense. Since this steady parade
was composed entirely of citizen-soldiers,
his remarks were apposite.
Two officers of the C.M.F. were given
prizes they had won in the Field-Marshal

Clyde Cameron's
Pretty Scheme
Since Comrade Thornton returned from
North America during the war with a
scheme to replace arbitration with collec-
tive bargaining, no scheme has been put
forward more speciously and more
cunningly thought-out than the one tor
union elections produced by Clyde
Cameron of S.A.
The essentials of it look so innocent
that to some it must seem as if Mr.
Cameron were shaping-up to join the
Employers’ Federation. Even the Demo-
cratic Labor Party has fallen for it.
Firstly, he wants what all the Com-
munists, not to mention himself, have
been opposing for years with great bitter-
ness: all-union secret election-ballots
conducted by the Commonwealth Elec-
toral Office, with compulsory voting,
every union election to be held on the
same day.
Key words in this include “compul-
sory voting.”. Among other things, this
is a first step to compulsory unionism.
The holding of elections throughout
the Commonwealth on the same day has
its purpose. It means common election-
funds. And this would enable the Com-
munist-run unions like the Watersiders
and the Seamen to marshal their money
to decide the fight and put Communists
into control of the kind of smail key-
unions whose members form bottlenecks
and who could thus be used to paralyse
industry through strikes of a few-dozen
men.
Great efforts would be made to con-
centrate on such unions which can’t be
won when elections are fought piecemeal
but in which, as plums in the pudding of
national elections, a great deal could be
done by pressure and intimidation, plus
outlay of money.
The second part of the Cameron pro-
posals is the enticing one that there
should be a safeguard against the dis-
missal of elected union officials save for
“impropriety or serious breach of union
rules.” The safeguard, of course, is for
Communist or extreme Leftist officials
in unions in which, as in the Federated
Clerks and the Ironworkers, there has
been a landslide and a residue.of Moscow
agents is in jeopardy.
There are some subsidiary rules which
show a trend towards compulsory union-
ism. With compulsory voting and the
rolls compiled from union rolls, unionists
would become a privileged class on such
a scale that the non-unionist or the non-
conforming unionist would find this a
cold, bleak world.
What Mr. Cameron and some “con-
vert” supporters in the Communist party
are likely to gain under the proposal as
outlined amounts to complete domina-
tion of all the unions through gradually
marshalling power and money and
concentrating them on particular union
elections.
Dunkirk
[From “C.S.”J
It has taken the premiere of the British
film “Dunkirk” to get the promise of
formation of an Australian branch of
the Dunkirk Veterans’ Association.
The premiere, the first outside Britain,
will be at the Bourke Street (Melbourne)
Metro, and 189 applicants turned-up to
form a Dunkirk guard-of-honor for the
Governor and to attend a champagne-
supper with him later
Only 20 were chosen, but the others
propose to get together, in Victoria at
least.
I wonder if the Dunkirk deliverance,
at a time when the British countries were
fighting almost alone, is fully appreciated
in Australia. On the second night of the
“lift” I was sitting in a vaudeville house
in Leicester Square next to a young officer
who looked tired ; he had come off the
Dunkirk beach that morning.
Can it ever be understood how near
a thing Dunkirk was?

was enjoyed by the whole crowd. The
color-addict was ready for convalescence
when he contracted mumps and was
transferred to an infectious-diseases hos-
pital. On recovery he was boarded by
the mumps-specialists and, forgetting to
mention his surgical history, was marked
“Fit for Active Service.” In due course
he appeared before the two Horseferry

recognising his patient, snatched-up the
papers and exploded. “Fit for active
service!” he roared. “What bloody fool

were explained the resulting row was

then and 1897, when the first car powered
by an internal-combustion engine was
put on the road by William Grayson

“This fine carriage is a smart piece of
skill, possessing the desired quick-turning
power for busy streets and narrow road-
ways . . The same year, in South Aus-

car that was the first car in the world
to use a differential. In 1904 Australian

SHEILA'S SHOE SHOP
"It's always the same . I bought them on h.-p. and they had to be half soled
before they were half-paid for."


JOHN LAFFIN’s reference (B. 23/4/’5B)
** to the inscription in Villers-Breton-
neux took me back 40 years. The 53rd
Battery was plugging its weary way down
from round Hazebrouck to the Somme.
Most of us who were on the guns hoofed
it in preference to riding on a limber;
those old 18-pounder limbers provided
a pretty hard seat, nor had they any
springs. So we mostly preferred to wear-
out our boots rather than our breeches,
the boots being much easier to replace.
Ted Davidson (he who became a bishop
later and who has just died) and I were
on one gun together and on that April
day in 1918 we were at the head of the
column.
We had not long passed through
Corbie when we met a French family
trudging along the muddy road. Pater-
familias had obviously been a soldier.
He was pushing a wheelbarrow piled high.
Next came his wife pushing another
wheelbarrow, though this one had
harnessed to it a large dog, who was
doing his best, Then came a boy and
a girl, the girl leading an elderly cow,
the boy arguing the point with a recalci-
trant pig, The old man had his head
down, and had just about drawn level
with the gun when he looked up.
I shall never forget his face as he
called out to his family: “Les Aus-
tralians!” As they couldn’t reach the
drivers, the whole four fell on Ted and
me. Ted, then a lad of 19, was some-
what embarrassed at the hugging he got
from Maman. As I was the only one in
the battery who could speak French
with any fluency, the O.C. came gallop-
ing up, and told me to warn the
family they must keep going, that
a break-through by Fritz was expected
at any moment, that we were to take-
up our position a few miles further on,
and that, once we did, considerable
shelling could be expected. Finally, that
it would be most unsafe for them to
remain. I explained all this to the old
man and his wife.
He looked at me for a full 10 seconds
and said: “Nous revenons. Les Aus-
tralians, jamais nils se retirent” (“We
return. Never do the Australians retreat.”)
It was perhaps the greatest compliment
ever paid the A.I.F. No amount of
argument would alter their decision. The
Australians had come; they were now
safe, and that was all there was to it.
So back they went to their farmhouse,
while we went on to the junction of the
Ancre and the Somme, there to annoy
Fritz with a spot of shelling until July,
1918. I have often wondered whether
the family were in fact safe, or whether
a stray shell intended for some of our
heavies found the wrong mark.

Or titbits for a barbecue —
They hate to gnaw a stranger<
For uncles big and fat they yearn
(There’s something in the flavor!)
Even a stringy aunt will earn
The compliment of a “return.” '
Cousins they love to savor.
Large families are imperative
If Guaruas would hope to live
Their lives in blissful plenty
With “long pig” never in short supply
To casserole and grill and fry ;
Happy and fat, to torpify
In dolce far niente.
And civilised man can’t have the face
To aim recriminations
At practice he may deem so base,
Yet which with him’s a commonplace,
Something he looks on as a grace:
To live on his relations!

A Letter from a Yank
WEATHER is, I am
sure, of more pressing
concern to us subur-
banites of the north-
eastern U.S.A. than all the dire
implications of the sputniks
put together. For example,
two inches of (snow plus
rain) greeted us one morning
towards winter’s end. It was
our turn to drive the “car-pool”
four wool - enshrouded
grade-scholars. They shrilled
joyously and steamed the
windows with their breath as
we slithered and fish-tailed
over the gelatinous roads.
From school onward to the
office five miles away it was
an hour of stop-and-go, zig-
zagging, fender-bending and
bumper-clunking through the
morning tide of steel, rubber,
glass and chrome we call
“traffic.”
At latitudes a couple of
hundred miles north of our
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
home, winter is nowhere
near the nuisance. There
it is generally an honest,
solid, steady, frigid thing.
I refer to upper New
York State and the upper
reaches of New England. Snow
comes and it stays. Since one
expects it, one gears physically
and philosophically for months
of icy whiteness and tempera-
tures that pinch the nose. So
do highway departments, with
battalions of snow-ploughs and
sand-trucks that start rolling
as the first flake falls.
But, here in the Delaware
River Valley, winter is usually
skulking and treacherous, pre-
tending to pass us by one
moment, turning to stab us in
the back the next. And the
rQad people, with as much
excuse not to buy equipment
as to do otherwise, choose to
fondle their budgets. The
motorist, it has been found,
will get there somehow.
Plaguing in winter or no,
water in any form is welcomed
by more-thoughtful parties.
Last summer in this area was
one of the driest on record.
Many places felt not a drop
of rain for several months of
the growing-season. In the
farm-country one saw a
feverish digging of new wells,
deepening of man-made ponds,
and dairymen hauling water
over considerable distances.
Groundwater tables sank
alarmingly and need replenish-
ment now. Sprinkler-irrigation
—even for pastures —is mov-
ing rapidly into this so-called
“humid” area.

youngsters just under legal
driving-age. It has, in fact, set-
up a new category of offending
the law. Instead of “car-theft,”
it is termed “unauthorised use
of vehicle.” For older boys,
on the other hand, community
“drag-strips” are proving good
safety-valves ... In our family
we’ve recently added a Vespa
motor-scooter that helps 15-
year-old Rob run-off his head-
of-steam.
A friend and I toured 1500
miles through Canada, includ-
ing Nova Scotia, last August,
via scooters. We found them
noble and thrifty little beasts,
each carrying about 300
pounds at better than 91 miles
to the gallon throughout the
trip. On the heels of our small-
car trend, scooters, too, seem
to be widening a beach-head. A
local dealer tells me his current
orders are double those of a
year ago. Chill weather limits
the scooter’s advantages in
these climes. Even so, they
appear to be helping an increas-
ing number of Yanks to
realise “you don’t need 300-
horsepower to carry a pack of
cigarettes.”

Picasso is in town. Or, I
should say, the largest
American exhibit of his work,
to date, is at the city Art
Museum. I mention this in
recollection of Brisbane’s lively
and sometimes pungent interest
in such matters. At any rate,
Mum and I went down and
let it knock us around a bit.
And we wouldn’t have wanted
to miss it. The marvellous
draftsmanship, bold color and
intense imagination. But I will
say we preferred the lucid,
straightforward things:
“Woman with Loaves,” and
the more obvious land- and
beach-scapes. Even these, it
was agreed, we might gladly
surrender for one of George
Aubrey-Crowe’s watercolors of
the Numinbah Valley!
TTERE in south-eastern Penn-
sylvania' we are rather
impoverished for boating, fish-
ing and other moist recreations.
For instance, our handiest
place for a dip is a State park
40 miles away. There, on a
hot holiday, one must battle
for a place in the sun can
hardly take two crawl-strokes
without thudding into another
bather. This has created a
notable trend of defence against
our sticky summers in the form
of neighborhood swim-clubs.
Three are in our community.
Each always has a long wait-
ing-list. In fact, our number
just came up, and we joined
one, for a $250 share in the
corporation, plus $3O annual
dues. For this we get access to
an L-shaped quarter-acre pool,
with wading-pool, lifeguard
protection, picnicking area,
bath-houses, showers and park-
ing. We anticipate it will be
well worth the expenditure. I
dare say our kiddos will be
popping in every warm after-
noon on their way home from
school.
Our crowded suburbs don’t
afford many places for such
clubs. Water-supply and
-disposal are big problems. So
are zoning-laws. Nearly every
club has a legal battle to begin
with before a permit is granted.
Adjoining householders almost
inevitably fear they will be sub-
jected to raucous splashing and
sporting at all hours. Rules of
conduct, therefore, must be
fight and rigidly enforced.

The move initiated by Ward to have
Cyril Chambers reinstated in the party
and re-endorsed as A.L.P. candidate for
Adelaide at the next election seems to
have been a fizzer. The S.A. branch
made it clear that it preferred its State
secretary, Sexton, and that even if he
stood-down it wouldn’t guarantee taking
Chambers back. Chambers himself says
he has no intention of standing as an
Independent or as a D.L.P. candidate.
If he can’t get the official Labor nomina-
tion he’ll retire at the end of the present
Parliament, having no desire to end his
Parliamentary career “by being branded
as a rat to the Labor party.” Chambers
was expelled from the A.L.P. for saying
the party would never win an election
while the Doc. was leading it. Most
of his colleagues have been content
merely to think it.

Austins, Citroens, Hillmans, Volks-
wagens and similar small cars are largely
responsible for the U.S. recession, accord-
ing to Ken F. Cox, chairman of A.R.C.
Industries, who has been looking-over
North American business. Americans are
shying-off large cars, and the manufac-
turers who employ, one way or another,
one in five U.S. workers have been hit
because they do not make a competi-
tively-sized car. So the U.S. car-makers
are having a recession while bank savings
are at record level and, with farm-income
£l5O million up in March over February,
the farmers are having their best season
since 1942.
Ken Cox isn’t expecting an Australian
recession. He is just setting-out, with two
other sportsmen, to establish a £lOO,OOO
thoroughbred stud to build-up the Vic-
torian bloodstock industry, which has
sagged in recent years.

With 10,000 signatures already on its
petition, the Capricornia New State
Movement hopes to make it 15,000 by
the time it goes to the Queensland Parlia-
ment in August. North Queensland is
aiming higher ; it expects 25,000. Nicklin
has told them to produce evidence that
the people of their areas want action
if they can show him enough evidence
he’ll consider a referendum.

Premier Bolte hasn’t been able to raise
any enthusiasm even in his own party
for his proposal for four-year Parlia-
ments. He should never have tossed-up
the kite. His Cabinet spent the first two
years of their term working hard, and
much of the last year patting themselves
on the back.
A four-year term would mean, pre-
sumably—if he gets it —two years of
work, a year to unwind and a year to lie
doggo.

“Ex-ACT”: Mention of the death of
former Federal Hansard chief George
Romans (B. 30/4/’5B) recalls that it is
the somewhat uncomfortable lot of
Hansard chiefs, when their retiring-day
arrives, to hear tributes paid in the House
to them by Prime Minister and
Opposition Leader while they themselves
sit at the table, perforce silent. Romans
found this quite an ordeal. So did his
successor, W. J. Campbell, who is now
also in the news, happily for a more
pleasant reason. Campbell, as an elected
member of the A.C.T. Advisory Council,
is taking a prominent part in the agita-
tion for the Capital Territory to have its
member of the House of Representatives
given full voting powers.

First day of the N. S. Wales new road-
tax brought an unexpected headache to
officials of the Transport Workers’ Union
in Sydney, when more than 1000 truck-
owner-drivers staged a strike against the
tax and sent a deputation of 50 to the
Trades Hall to demand union action
against the tax. The officials were for
once at a loss. A strike over wages or
conditions is routine stuff. But a strike
against a tax imposed on owners by a
Labor Government—well, just how does
a union bloke go about organising it?

South Australia and Victoria in 1957
again topped the list in percentages of
population-increase, with 2.8 per cent, and
2.6 per cent, respectively. Queensland
(1.6 per cent.) and N. S. Wales (2 per
cent.) brought up the rear. Differing
ratios of absorption of migrants were the
main reason for the disparity. Queens-
land didn’t do much more than break-
even in arrivals and departures, and in
proportion to population the N. S. Wales
intake of migrants was far below that of
South Australia and Victoria. Net-
migration figures for the various States
in 1957 were: Victoria, 31,000; N. S.
Wales, 26,000 ; South Australia, 12,300 ;
Westralia, 3750; Tasmania, 2300;
Queensland, 396.
Estimated population of the Common-
wealth at December 31, 1957. was
9,747,471. Individual figures for the
States and territories were:
N.S.W. .. 3,660,497 W.A. .. 700,214
Vic. .. 2,700,635 Tas. .. 340,866
Q’ld. .. 1,401,427 A.C.T. .. 39,114
S.A. .. 886,203 N.T. .. 18,515
The Commonwealth Statistician expects
the total to reach 10 million some time
in March next year.

“Selective” price-control will be re-
introduced by the A.L.P. in the remark-
able event of its winning the Victorian
State elections. How selective it would
be remains to be explained, and it is
probably one of John Galbally’s lesser
brainwaves.
During Cain’s Premiership, in 1954,
price-control ended when the Legislative
Council, in which there was only a hand-
ful of A.L.P. members, refused to extend
it. It died unlamented, but some

“Mugga Way”: Reports of the Prime
Minister circling in fog around Mel-
bourne recalled the war-time (and
unpublished) Incident when the DCS
(a rare bird) in which he was returning
from Tasmania could not get its wheels
locked in position for landing at that same
airport. During the hour of unpleasant
jolting as the pilot did his best with the
recalcitrant landing-gear at a height of
a mile or so, and as the uncomfortable
passengers glimpsed a new cemetery
beneath them every few moments, the
then Leader of the Opposition was asked
if he would care to dictate a final message
to the nation which could be cast out of
the window. Menzies’ testy reply is still
recalled by at least one person who was
Within earshot. The landing, with
ambulances, fire-tenders and what-nots
in attendance, was perfect.

The A.L.P. Anti-Eviction and Tenants
Protection Committee ended its brief
career ©n Sunday night with a decision
to disband itself. The decision was
probably made with mixed feelings—as
mixed as the motives of the members
for joining the committee. Reports
circulated during the week, and on which
the State executive of the A.L.P. appar-
ently took action, alleged that Eddie
Ward and other Left-wing Labor M.P.s,
Federal and State, intended to use the
committee as a weapon to “capture” the
A.L.P. conference in June, and were
prepared to risk losing the Cahill Govern-
ment the next State election in order to
strengthen their own grip on the party —
the ultimate aim being the Federal
Labor leadership for Ward.
As soon as Campbell, chairman of the
State executive, began to talk of disci-
plinary action and to point-out that as
the body was not sponsored by the
executive it was not entitled to call itself
an A.L.P. organisation, the less zealous
began to stand from under. By Sunday
it was all over —for the present. The
committee’s disbandment motion, inter-
larded with phrases about “rapacious
landlords” and “exploitation of home-
seekers,” professed to expect that the
State executive would now establish a
committee to carry-out the Ward com-
mittee’s policy. And so full-steam ahead
to the June conference.

As was expected, the D.L.P. has said
“Nothing doing” to the Doc.’s offer of

it could help to return the Evatt party

It is more or less a traditional privi-
lege of a citizen to throw eggs at poli-
ticians. Pies are a different matter. In
the Manly Court of Petty Sessions a
man was charged with offensive behavior
for having thrown a pie at a car in which
N. S. Wales Minister for Agriculture
R. B. Nott was a passenger. According
to Nott’s evidence, gravy and mincemeat
were spattered over his coat, shirt and
trousers; the pie was thrown from a
utility which Nott’s car was passing. The
pie-thrower claimed he had been giving
a right-hand signal when a car behind
him sounded its horn repeatedly. He
then began to pull over to the left and
withdrew his right hand to “assist in
the action.” Then “realising that my
right hand still retained a portion of
uneaten pie, I tossed the pie out of the
window.” He said he had no idea who
was in the car. After hearing pie-
thrower and pie-copper, M. J. Austin,
S.M., said he had no doubt that the pie
was thrown deliberately. He imposed a
fine approximately equivalent to 100 pies.

When the Cahill road-tax bill was
before the N. S. Wales Parliament the
Government refused to consider exempt-
ing primary-producers using their own
vehicles to carry their own produce. The
argument, now repeated by Minister for
Justice Downing, was that the Govern-
ment had had legal advice that such a
provision would make the bill unconsti-
tutional. The Victorian and Queens-
land Governments must have had other
advice. Both their Road-tax Acts provide
exemptions.

Australia under the plan. Only one item
in a very considerable list seems to have
been a failure—a miniature harvesting-
machine which was tested in ricefields

No marketing-board in Victoria enjoys
much prestige among consumers, but the
Egg Board is undoubtedly in the worst
odor of the. lot. Its latest gesture to State
consumers is an announcement that eggs
will be stamped large or small, with a
code-number, the letters V.E.B. and a
number running from one to six for each
week of a series of six weeks.
Instead of all this lettering and
numerals, most folk would prefer to see
simply a date, but the board says it
doubts if it could get a date on an egg—
although it can get V.E.8., large, a
number and a code-number. To a
suggestion that crafty traders might hold
eggs for six \veeks until their number
(at least) became fresh again, the board
says naively that no retailer would hoard
perishable food.

Egypt seems to have got the better of
the bargain in the agreement on com-
pensation to the shareholders of the Suez
Canal Co. Full settlement is £stg.29
million, to be paid in seven instalments
over six years. First payment is to be
round about £5 million, to be paid by
Britain releasing the equivalent from
canal-dues paid in London and Paris
since the seizure of the canal. So for
the moment the position is that each
side holds what it has. Nasser has the
canal and it is agreed that he may keep
it. The Western Powers have £5 million
in canal-dues and it’s agreed that they
may keep ’em. As to future instalments
—well, there’s always Cleopatra’s
Needle or the mummies in the British
Museum to be brought into account.
THE HAUNTED GUEST-ROOM


PERSONAL ITEMS
“D. S.”: It is not to be supposed that
when two such celebrities as Malcolm
Muggeridge and Norman Lindsay meet
they turn somersaults over the lawn at
Springwood or throw bombs at each
other. They save all that for their writ-
ings. And, having had the pleasure of
driving Muggeridge up to the Blue
Mountains for the meeting, I find that,
even on editorial request, I have very
little to say about it. They sat down
quietly and talked about books and
mutual acquaintances Somerset
Maugham, Owen Seaman and Max
Beerbohm —and I’m afraid that the only
things Muggeridge said which might
startle his TV audiences were cracks
about a couple of Britain's best-known
writers. What most struck me about
him, as well as his politeness, his
shrewdness and his persistence in
asking awkward questions, was his
imperturbability. Even when he asked
the burly publican on the way up
could he have a sandwich and the publi-
can said “Nuh” —just that and nothing
more —he took it on the chin without
murmuring; and in fact the only time I
saw him the slightest bit rattled the whole
day was when we got back to his hotel
at King’s Cross and they told him,
amongst six other messages, that “Mel-
bourne had rung.” “Did he?” said
Muggeridge. And, when he had seen
Jack Lang on the Wednesday, Norman
R . N. WEIR, general-manager of
Allan and Stark, Ltd., the Brisbane
store, and chairman of Sargeants
Engineering, Ltd.
Lindsay on the Friday, and was to go on
TV with the redoubtable Santamaria
next morning, that solitary moment’s
confusion was more than understandable.

The Blind Book Society’s exhibition of
Australian books at Anthony Hordern’s,
Sydney, opening on June 9, is intended to
remind people of the mass of Australian
(and other) writing from which the blind,
by reason of theitxmisfortune, are norm-
ally excluded, Kenneth Bruce, secretary of
the Blind Book Society and himself sight-
less, told The Bulletin. The, aim of the
society, a registered charity with head-
quarters at 491 Pitt Street, Sydney, is
to fill this grievous gap in some measure
by distributing, free of charge, tape-
recorded books which can be played on
talking-book machines at home. It costs
BLIND LIBRARY
about 2gns. to record a book, complete
with title, author’s name and the name
of the donor, and six cop : es are usually
made ; when demand slackens five are
erased and one kept in stock. Ken
Bruce (likeness by Aria herewith) said
that local publishers had waived copy-
right, subject to author’s consent, which
in every case so far had been given.
Some authors had gone further, reading
their own work. The society borrows
recorded books from the Royal Blind
Society and the Repatriation Department,
but hopes eventually to build-up a
sufficient libarary to make available to
the blind a more representative range of
literatu. e than has been available to them
in the past.

afterwards —by Szentleleky —at The
Bulletin office. Large, quiet, silver and
impeccably turned-out, like - a well-
groomed first-edition, he has spent 30
years in the book-Jrade, starting at
Spencer’s; and, naturally, talks about
books: notably Birds of New Guinea, a
most beautiful edition-de-luxe which was
highly recommended among the publi-
shers’ “Books of the Year,” and two
forthcoming publications, a German
migrant’s account of hitch-hiking across
the world to Australia and a book about
—of all things—cast-iron. He said that
at Geelong, Vic., there is a house,
imported from Glasgow, made entirely
of this versatile substance.

Dropping in at The Bulletin the other
day, John Shaw Rennie, British Resident
Commissioner in the New Hebrides,
explained how the condominium of the
New Hebrides was formed in 1906 and
that since then Great Britain and France
had jointly administered the archipelago.
This is the only condominium existing in
the world.
The British Overseas Service does its
share in administering the New Hebrides
from London, although the islands are
economically and strategically connected
to Australia. John Rennie is an officer
of the British Overseas Service (formerly
the Colonial Service). He comes from
Scotland, and served in Tanganyika and
Mauritius before going to the New


Hebrides in July, 1955. He had much to
say about these volcanic islands, of which
the staple trade is copra, but which also
produce cocoa and timber and where
there are prospects of mining.
He also said that his French colleague
has lately been up to Vanikoro in the
Solomons, where he has rediscovered the
site of the vessel in which La Perouse
was shipwrecked. The French resident
has collected relics from the wreck in the
form of anchors and cannon.

ABORIGINALITIES
BACK in the late ’twenties the tales
told of Fanny Bay jail, Darwin, must
have run into hundreds. Swopping them
round the campfire before rolling into
our swags was one of the regular
diversions in the Territory stockcamps.
Many of them were probably apocry-
phal, I suppose, but some of them, on
the theory of averages, must have been
true, or nearly so.
There is the one of the redoubtable
old jail-superintendent, Sgt. Dempsey,
who, when all the best citizens of Darwin
were going to jail for refusing to pay
income-tax as a protest against their non-
representation in Federal Parliament,
phoned the superintendent of police to
ask if he, the s. of p., would mind seeing
“She used to he quite a nifty little number when I was
a young fellow .”
that each small batch of offenders sent
out by the judge contained at least three
bridge-players.
And there was the cove who sued Sgt.
Dempsey for damages arising out of the
cove’s breaking an arm trying to get over
the wall into the jail when, returning
late from a day’s leave in town, he found
the gates locked.
But the one I like best concerned two
constables doing a stretch of jail-guard
duty, whose names, for the purpose of
this tale, will be Mulveeney and Dunoon.
One warm morning, armed with loaded
.3035, they found themselves in charge
of a party of native prisoners detailed
for a leisurely job of scrub-clearing on
the farthest boundary of the jail’s grazing-
area. The party included Wollogorang
Tommy and Lame Paddy, both amiable
murderers—of other natives.
Arrived at the scene pf their labors,
and seeing their gang more-or-less at
work, Mul and Dun retired to the shade
of a tree, there to spend the rest of the
day. An hour or two later they were
joined by a passing friend and a couple
of bottles of “square,” an oily Dutch
gin with a powerful kick, sold in tall,
square, black bottles.
Three or four hours later again, Lame
Paddy, waking from a prolonged after-
lunch snooze and
noting the position
of the westing sun,
roused the rest of
the party and pre-
pared to return to
jail. “More better
allabout boy been
catchem that one
pleecemans and take
’im back longa carry
’im longa jail.”
And a little later
again, from the
veranda of his
house, Sergeant
Pempsey gazed
unbelievingly at a
long, single-file pro-
cession, at the rear
of which, carried
shoulder-high, were
the somnolent forms
of ‘ Mul and Dun.
Behind them, armed
with loaded .3035,
marched Lame
Paddy and Wollo-
gorang Tommy.

“H. C. B”: But
has the wharfie any
greater flair for
humorous or scath-
ing nomenclature
than any other
Aussie worker (B.
16/4/’58)? The
building-trade has produced some apt
monickers. There was the hodcarrier
whose dislike of washing earned for him
the title of “The Camel”—he could go
for so long without water. An old Irish
brickie addicted to the habit of surround-
ing himself and his job with nauseating
splashes of chewed tobacco retained the
designation which some unknown
nomenclator chalked on his wall: “The
llama —this animal spits.” “St. Vitus,” a
carpenter, received his handle because
his surname was Twitchings. Bat the
one that tickled me most was “Seidlitz”
—he was a New Aussie whose real name
sounded something like Fizzgwick.

“Fuzzy Wuzzy”: Training of Papuan
youths in Navy League and Sea Cadet
groups is envisaged as one way of help-
ing the development of inter-island
shipping in the Australian territories in
the Pacific. During a visit to Moresby
John Howse, Parliamentary Under-
secretary to the Minister for Territories,
suggested that an amendment of the
law might also allow trained Papuans
to join the R.A.N.

“Lignum”: Riley Groundwater, an
expert amateur hunter, of the West Dar-
ling, recently secured a “ringed” black
duck. From the markings on the ring
it was established that the bird had
migrated from New Zealand. Why it
should have abandoned the rich feeding-
grounds across the Tasman in favor of
the arid regions of the far west of N.S.W.
is a puzzle to ornithologists.
* * * *
“Manamoi”: Many bets have been
lost on the question, “Has Australia any
privately-owned railway services?” You
won’t catch the Westralians with that
one. In 1891, the first year of respon-
sible government in the big State, its
suitably large Premier, Sir John Forrest,
granted the Midland Railway Company
permission to build a line from Perth
to Geraldton, which is still operated by
the same company. No takers in Central
Queensland either—they all know the
Aramac Tramway, so-called. This line
was built in 1907 by the Aramac Shire
Council to connect their town with the
main Central-Western Line at Barcaldine,
40-odd miles away. v The council has
replaced its rather Hornby-ish little
steam-engine with a diesel. I hope the
steamer, after more than 40 years of
excellent service, will be suitably housed
and preserved.

claim that a fleeing ’roo’s ejectment of
her joey is both automatic and un-
conscious, her haste being too great to
allow her to use her paws for the-job.
This is definitely not the experience of
hunters (including myself) where the
big hoppers abound. The maternal one
does in fact use her forepaws, deliber-
ately heaving the small one in the
direction opposite to her line of flight.

“Bre”: While I was spraying ants’-
nests in the garden with dieldrin, pants
tucked into socks, many ants climbed
over my shoes, socks and trousers-legs
and took a firm grip. At the conclusion
of spraying I brushed the ants off before
going inside for a cuppa. No sooner
had I stretched-out my legs than the




house-cat came and licked my shoes and
socks, then rubbed himself vigorously
all over them, finishing with a roll over
the shoes. This happened two different
times after spraying. It hasn’t hap-
pened on any occasion that I have worn
those shoes without going near the ants’-
nests. Perhaps cats, like birds, like the
taste and feel of formic acid. It also
appears that the smell of formic acid
arouses the fighting-instinct in ants. I
have found that every time I approached
a new nest after shoes and trousers had
been attacked at a previous nest, the
ants would rush to the attack while I
was still several feet away.

gaudy- colors, and bodgie- and widgie-

their teenagers. Maori elders are con-

“Fairf”: It didn’t need a very experi-
enced fisherman to know that the catch
was an octopus, and a pretty big one by
the feel of it. It was an octo., all right,
but not such a big one as it seemed,
mainly because it had left a firm bottom
for the security of a small cave —and that
cave was the bottom half of a broken
demijohn. A bewildered look in its eye,
the octo. vacated the premises on seeing
the change of address, and, having some-
how got rid of the hook, floundered off

into the drink. His erstwhile home
remained there till a small boy earned
the wrath of the assembled anglers by
chucking it in, just for the splash. An
hour later I hauled in again—same octo.,
or his twin, firmly braced in the same
treacherous hidey-hole.

“Bushrod”: Question of the possible
overlap of the two eastern “species” of the
silvereye (B. 19/3/’5B) doesn’t arise.
Since 1947, both the grey-breasted and
grey-backed silvereyes are officially the
same species (Z. lateralis). Ornithology
is not a static science, and in the 27 years
since Cayley was published many changes
have been made in the status of different
species, in the light of further information.
The change of status affecting the silver-
eyes was based on work by George Mack,
now Director of the Queensland
Museum, back in 1932.

pure Saanen-type, on their hind leg's,
doubled forelegs raised, hanging from the

then out shoots the tongue, higher still,
to wrap around the foliage and pull it
down until a big mouthful is secured.
Around them the nannies, outclassed,

Where the quick water glitters and glistens.

To hear the stream sing, to hear the creek

“Horseless Horseman”: On Kolora
station, Hay (N.S.W.), last week I
watched a mysterious flying object dive
from the heavens at great speed. Then,
as the phenomenon neared the distant
river-plain, it flattened-out and spread
like a giant explosion as it drifted slowly
west towards the line of Murrumbidgee
gums. I realised then it was a huge
flock of birds, and next day I got a close-
up of them. They were starlings, tens
of thousands strong, flying wing-tip to
wing-tip and forming what seemed a
solid black cloud. At times the birds
on top opened-out as they zoomed about
the upper air while those underneath
still held their packed formation, the
whole giving the effect of a giant

Nellie was about 16 they took her
with them. By then she was quite
accomplished and was treated as one of

“Tiki”: Age-old Maori superstitions
have halted the N.Z. Government from
removing a dangerous traffic-hazard five
miles outside Hawke’s Bay, City of
Hastings. For many years successive
Governments have been blocked in their
moves to erase the obstacle because of
strong and concerted protests from the
Maoris, who doggedly hold to their
observance of old tribal customs and
beliefs. The traffic-hazard is a big stone
on the main road, one of many the
Maoris placed at intervals of a few
miles along their main tracks. Bodies
being carried to distant burial-grounds
were rested on them. Maori legends had
it that resting bodies on the ground of
their dead displeased the gods, making
the earth at the spot tapu, and casting a
blight on any crops sown near it.
The Hawke’s Bay sacred Maori stone is
recorded in their accounts of tribal wars,
specifically concerning the sacrificial
slaying of Huia, a maiden.

“Tom Trout”: In Welsh mining-
villages it’s not a question of how many
sheep to the acre or how many acres to
the sheep, but of how many sheep to the
street. There, anyone with a yen to be a
pastoralist but no paddocks to his name
simply turns his jumbucks out to graze
the cracks between the cobbles. No one
seems to mind —except, perhaps, garden-
owners with fences low enough to be
jumped. The woollies develop quite a
fair traffic-sense, though an occasional
mauled corpse by the roadside testifies to
an underestimate of the speed of the
modern car, a lapse not uncommon
amongst human pedestrians!

HTHE origin of the phoenix legend is
more complicated than that given by
Dr. Maurice Burton in his book Animal
Legends (B. 12/2/’5B).
The trade in bird-of-paradise feathers
is as ancient as that of jade or amber.
Archaeologists have unearthed plenty of
proof, one of the most striking finds
being the discovery of bronze trade-
goods in the form of axe- and adze-
heads at Lake Sentani, on the north
coast of Dutch New Guinea and close
to Humboldt Bay, headquarters of the
feather trade for thousands of years.
Malay sea-traders used to secure bird-
of-paradise skins there and, in order to
protect the precious contents and give
the package an added value, the wrapping
was given a thick coating of dammar-
gum, one of the resins which, under the
general name of myrrh, was burned in
temples as incense. These packets were
traded via Indonesia to China, India,
Persia and Egypt, with the stories about
the birds from which the gorgeous
feathers had come becoming more weird
and wonderful with distance.
The Chinese merely thought that the
birds had no legs—the natives who
secured them used to cut off the feet —
lived on dew and flew always with their
heads towards the sun ; but by the time
the skins reached Egypt at the end of
the 12,000-mile trade-route—the longest
in the Ancient World —the bird was
credited with consuming itself with fire
when it grew old and being reborn from
the ashes.
No doubt those notorious liars the
Phoenicians, always ready to pitch any
tale which would enhance the value of
the exotic goods carried in their ships
and to conceal the source of supply, had
a lot to do with the weird oeliefs held in
Egypt. Pieces of that dammar-gum from
Celebes, with some of the original wrap-
ping from around the bird-skin still
adhering to them, have been dug up on
many sites in the Middle East.

Sharemarket Doubts
AN accumulation of adverse
economic factors (and defla-
tion of oil-share interest) has
tended to bring about a sagging
in sharemarket support during
the past few days. Wool prices
have gone down to their lowest
level since 1949, metal-mining
has been hit hard by low world
prices, dairying is also affected
by similar factors (N.Z. particu-
larly so), and there is still
a hangover in Australian
production and production-
costs from the drought of the
past summer.
As all these things relate to
exports, there was a fall of
£BO million in our overseas
income during the nine months
July-March (compared with
the corresponding period of
1956-57). In the same time our
export-surplus was down to
£49 million, compared with
£192 million —an adverse move-
ment of £143 million in the
balance of trade. An increase
of £6l million in our imports-
bill (£592 million) was partly
responsible for the drift.
Internally, industrial produc-
tion has not shown much sign
of suffering from the down-
turn in our overseas income.
Except for refrigerators and
some textiles, most significant
categories of industrial produc-
tion (as supplied in the
Treasury’s latest Information
Bulletin) show upward move-
ments in the period July-
February.
Industrial stability is likely
to be helped, for a limited
period, by the release of
frozen funds by the central
bank. Also, there continues
to be a strong consumer-
demand within the country that
depends for its satisfaction
upon domestic production. And
many national works can be
carried-out largely by internal
effort with home-produced
materials.
But we need our export
income to buy many things
that are as yet obtainable only
from abroad and to sustain
land industries and mining-
operations. The purchasing-
power that comes into the
hands of rural areas depends
considerably upon prices for
our produce sold overseas. If
export prices remain low, then
we must reconcile ourselves to
a real loss of wealth flowing
into the country and some dis-
ruption to the economic order
we have become accustomed to
over the past few years.
Even where readjustments are
possible following a severe loss
of external income, usually they
cause a good deal of economic
discomfort.
If current price-levels persist
during 1958-59, then our
export-values will be much
lower than those already
averaged during 1957-58 so
far.
Australian investors are wise
in taking a more cautious view
of current market prospects.
While the long-term view for
most well-established industries
is attractive, there is a fair price
for everything, and in many
instances “glamor” stocks for
some time past seem to have
been overpriced in Australia.
It is a fatal mistake to count
on “m a r k e t - increment”
making-up for lack of a
reasonable income-yield over
the period of intended holding.
Metal Shares
Broken Hill and
Broken Hill South having
forecast losses on mining
operations for the year to
June 30 next, and North having
cut (ts interim from 4s. to 2s.
per ss. stock-unit, South from
4s. to Is. 6d., it was natural
enough that the market for
all base-metal shares should
take a knock, even though
experienced operators had
probably w r orked-out already
what the economic position at
the Barrier was likely to be.
Fortunately the old-estab-
lished Barrier cos. have some
fat, in the form of investments,
to help keep the wolf from the
door during periods of
depressed metal-prices. Other
concerns are not usually so
lucky.
But if efficient, low-cost
producers like the Broken Hill
silver-lead companies are now
mining and milling at a loss,
some overseas concerns may be
forced to shut-down altogether,
which would tend to bring
supply of lead and zinc more
into line with demand, and so
to stabilise prices.

or earnings; but it is stated
that the net tangible backing
for the ss. units is 10s. 6d. a

tenance of that average rate.
The board is quoted as antici-
pating, on current results, a
dividend of 16.6 p.c. p.a.,
which would give a yield of
£9 11s. sd. per cent, on the
proposed div. and placement-
price.
It is not clear whether the
Snowy Mountains contract will
create a need for more
ordinary capital, but if it does
holders of the present issue

OIL CRISIS IN PAPUA
By L. OWEN, A.R.C.S. (Loud.), A.R.S.M., D.I.C., F.Inst.Pet.
HTHE serious search for
A petroleum in Papua may
be said to date from July, 1919,
when an agreement was signed
between the British and Aus-
tralian Governments and the
Anglo-Persian (now British
Petroleum) Co. whereby the two
Governments provided £50,000
each, while the A.-P. Co.
supplied and directed the tech-
nical staff for geological
exploration and drilling.
In these days £lOO,OOO would
be of little use for the financing
of a major search for oil, par-
ticularly in a terrain as difficult
as Papua. In 1919, however, the
sum was considered adequate.
Later the obligation proved
burdensome, for the British
Government withdrew from the
arrangement in 1921 and the
Australian Government
followed suit in 1927. In spite
of these withdrawals, the A.-P.
Co. did not suspend operations
until October, 1929.
The work resulted in a fine
series of geological maps and
reports spread over an area
extending from Yule Island to
west of the Vailala River.
Several well-sites were chosen
on the structures mapped and
five wells ranging in depth
from 888 ft. to 2707 ft. —were
drilled on the very broken anti-
clinal structure at Popo,
presumably because of the oil-
seepages found there. In all of
these wells the notorious “heav-
ing shale” of the Papuan
Miocene gave trouble; no
results of any commercial value
were obtained.,although small
quantities of oil and gas were
struck.
From the recorded data, it
was an obvious conclusion that
drilling on broken ground in
seepage country in Papua had
very little chance of yielding
worth-while results. This fact
was in entire conformity with
general experience (including
my own) in other parts of the
world.
I arrived in Papua at the
beginning of 1938 to report on
a small coastal oil-exploration
permit of 75 square-miles,
running n.-w. from Cape
Possession. In view of past
experience, my first action-
following on a reconnaissance
of the area—was to stop
drilling, already in progress
on a very broken belt with
gas-shows, and to initiate
a detailed geological survey
with the object of block-
ing-out more stable structures
suitable for oil segregation and
preservation. When this work
was sufficiently advanced, I
located a deep test-well on a
favorable structure. I left the
company’s employ before this
well was drilled and I was
astounded to learn, some
months later, that the well had
been abandoned—apparently
through incorrect drilling tech-
nique— at the shallow depth of
around 2500 ft.
Much additional geological
knowledge with reference to
coastal Papua has accrued since
that date through the intensive
geological and geophysical
surveys and drilling, carried-
out by Australasian Petroleum.
My own views have been
modified, of course, in the light
of the new data, but, at the
time, the completion of my
well would have been of very
considerable value to all con-
cerned and might have avoided
much abortive drilling.
Exhaustive Exploration
Australian Petroleum com-
menced its systematic survey
for petroleum in Papua in 1938.
The permit granted to that
group of companies covered
9944 square-miles and had
common boundaries with the
small area, on which I was
working, to the west, north
and east. The first well to be
drilled as a result of the work
carried-out by Australasian
Petroleum was sited, like mine,
on a relatively unbroken
structure away from oil- and
gas-seepages.
This Kariava well was
located about 70 miles up the
Vailala River, at Lat. 7° 20'S,
and Long. 145° 30'E., approxi-
mately. It was spudded-in on
March 8, 1941, and was finally
completed, at the phenomenal
depth of 12,621 ft., which then
constituted an Australasian
record. It produced nothing
of commercial value —other
than geological data of incal-
culable worth—but some of the
cores recovered showed slight
oil-impregnations.
The rig was then moved
southwards to Hohoro, near the
mouth of the Vailala River,
and, surprisingly, a well was
drilled there within the Vailala
shatter-zone, already notable
for its seepages, difficult drill-
ing conditions and failures. It
is possible that the choice of
this site may have been dictated
by political rather than
geological considerations, or it
may have been that it was
hoped that the powerful rig
used at Kariava would be
capable of overcoming the
hazards of the treacherous
Papuan “heaving-shale” and
strike oil either within the
Miocene argillaceous series or
below —in competent porous
and permiable beds.
After experiencing extremely
difficult drilling conditions, the
Hohoro well was eventually
carried down, late in 1952, to
the depth of 10,642 ft., where it
was abandoned without
encountering any formations
which could act as oil-
reservoirs.

had reached basement at
Oroi, in the extreme south-
eastern part of the permit and
had been abandoned at 5516 ft.,
after striking some gas, late
in 1949. Equally disappointing
results were obtained at Mala-
laua and, further west, at
Upoia in the Vailala zone.
The Westward Trek
Interest of the operators
then shifted away from the
east and the Vailala fault-
zone and moved westward from
the Aure Trough to the
Western Papuan Basin, where
a well was already drilling near
Omati at Lat. 7° 30'S., Long.
144 E., approximately. Here,
limestones were the predominat-
ing feature, and the Wana well
(Lat. 70° 30'S., Long. 144° 45'E.
approx.), had given proof of
the existence of extensive
porous and permiable strata by
striking a considerable flow of
salt-water. These conditions
were in happy contrast to those
of the shales, mudstones, silts
and tuffaceous beds of the Aure
Trough which had, at best, pro-
duced only small and transient
shows of oil and gas.
Omati 1, after a series of
setbacks, was drilled to the
limit of the rig and was
abandoned at 14,352 ft. High-
pressure “wet” gas was struck
at 13,743 ft., and it was truly
unfortunate that the collapse
of the well just above this
depth prevented a thorough
testing of the very interesting
gas-horizon before it was
almost completely sealed-off by
caving, although there was some
suggestion that it would not
produce a commercial yield.
Omati 2, which had been
spudded-in two miles to the
west of No. 1 in April, 1954,
was stopped, therefore, at
10,880 ft. It is probable that
this decision was influenced by
the fact that geological and
geophysical surveys indicated
better prospects to the north
and west.
Aramia well (Lat. 7° 50'S.,
Long. 142° 20'E., approx.) was
spudded-in on April 12, 1955,
but entered basement-rocks at
6538 ft., having encountered
only very slight traces of gas
and oil; it was abandoned at
6628 ft. on September 6, 1955.
Kuru 1 well (Lat. 7° 10'S.,
Long. 144° 30'E. approx.) was
spudded-in on January 1, 1956,
and struck a very heavy flow
of high-pressure “wet” gas at
968 ft. which ran wild. It was
brought under control under
very difficult conditions with
superbly skilful technique.
Kuru 2, which was practically
an offset to Kuru 1, was
commenced on June 16, 1956,
and encountered the same gas-
horizon, under the same
pressure conditions. On deepen-
ing, however, the gas was found
to be underlain by water, and
the well was abandoned at
7305 ft. owing to continuous
caving.
The prospects of striking
commercial gas or oil below
that depth were considered to
be favorable, but it was
decided that the lower column
could be tested to greater
advantage at a site half-a-mile
away, to be called Kuru 3.
The Barikewa test-well was
located some 40 miles west of
Kuru and was spudded-in on
August 11, 1956. Moderate
to substantial shows of gas
were encountered above 8000 ft.
At the beginning of April of
this vear the well had reached
10,262 ft.
The Morehead test-well
(Lat. 8° 45'5., Long. 141° 30'E.
approx.) was started on
October 5, 1956. Drilling-tools
stuck in the hole at 8087 ft., and
the expenditure of time and
money necessary for their
recovery before drilling could
be resumed was not considered
warranted, as seismic evidence
indicated that the well was
closely approaching basement.
No gas or oil “shows” were
noted in this well.
Komewu J test-well (Lat.
7° 15'S., Long. 143° 05'E.
approx.) was spudded-in on
April 10, 1957. It reached
basement at 6135 ft. without
recording any gas or oil
“shows” and was completed
at 6393 ft. in October, 1957.
Komewu 2 well, two miles from
1, was commenced on Novem-
ber 30, 1957. It entered base-
ment rocks at 9950 ft. and was
completed at 9977 ft. in early
April, 1958.
The Sireru test-site, 8 miles
north of the Kuru structure,
was spudded-in in June, 1957.
It was located with the object
of testing the northern exten-
sion of the Kuru gas-horizon,
which was reached, here, at
1510 ft., but contained brine.
The well was abandoned in
Aueust, 1957.
The Puri well (Lat. 7° 05'S.,
Long. 144° 55'E. approx.) was
started on October 29, 1957.
At the beginning of April, 1958,
it had reached the depth of
5980 ft. No oil or gas has been
reported to date.
The forward programme
comprises the completion of the
wells now drilling at Barikewa
and Puri and of the well to be
sunk on location Kuru 3, all to
conclusive depths.
Prospects
All the wells included in the
current programme are located
near a line running west-east
very slightly below the 7°S.
parallel of latitude, and extend-
ing from just west of Long.
144°E. to Long. 145°E. Drill-
ing-results have proved the
existence of a zone (or zones)
of porous and permiable beds,
charged with high-pressure
“wet” gas underlying this line.
Owing to the nature of the
gas the presence of oil, also,
is probable. The lateral extent
of the porous and permiable
strata is still unknown, but the
striking of salt-water at Sireru,
8 miles north of Kuru, would
suggest a minimum width of
possibly 15 miles.
From an original permit-
area of 9944 square-miles, as a
result of intensive aerial and
ground geological, geophysical,
and topographical surveys
extending over 16,000 square-
miles, a block of roughly 70
miles by 15 miles —or, say,
1000 square-miles—has been
culled.
That this culling has taken-
up 20 years of expert specialist
endeavor, at a cost of £3O
million, is largely beside the
point. What matters is that this
valuable result has been
attained in spite of the
enormous difficulties which
none unfamiliar with the
Papuan hinterland can appre-
ciate.
In the event of the current
programme failing to produce
worth-while results, the with-
drawal of the major partners
from further participation will
load Oil Search, Ltd., with
very heavy problems. On the
other hand, it will provide the
company with a valuable legacy
in the form of a highly selective
area within which the search
for oil can be conducted on a
much smaller budget than
would have been necessary for
the larger permit-area now held.
Within that limited area, it is
my considered opinion that the
prospects of commercial
success, to properly conducted
and controlled exploratory and
developmental work, are as
bright as those of any unproved
territory in the Southern
Hemisphere.
Problems
Very little specific data has
been released with reference
to the physical characteristics
of the gas-bodies encountered
in the Papuan wells, and,
apart from the description of
the gas as “wet,” no chemical
analyses have been made avail-
able to the public. There can
be no doubt, however, that the
gas struck in the Western
Papuan Basin has undergone
substantial migration from its
source-bed.
A major problem is to
discover whether this migration
occurred up approximately
vertical planes or whether the
direction of travel included
considerable lateral com-
ponents.
Clues for “the solution of
these questions are to be found,
for instance, in changes in gas-
composition from point to
point, in variations in the con-
centration and composition of
brines, and in the physical and
chemical characteristics of the
strata enclosing them.
Above all, no effort should
be spared to obtain a com-
prehensive and true understand-
ing of the geological history of
the region.

Stage and Music
New York Ballet
Of the three new ballets
presented in the company’s
third Sydney programme, “The
Duel” (choreography William
Dollar, music Raffaelo de Ban-
field), packed the most drama.
Based on the Tasso poem,
“Jerusalem Delivered,” the
story of the woman warrior
who during the Crusades met
death and defeat, after many
victories, at the hands of her
lover Tancred, was mimed with
sharp realism and danced
beautifully by Melissa Hayden.
Small, slim and very supple,
Miss Hayden may be the
physical antithesis of the fear-
some battleaxe of old, but her
swift litheness made it more
than possible to believe that her
flicking, imagined sword-point
could find its way into the
biggest masculine frame. Fran-
cisco Moncian danced the role
of Tancred with sure and facile
technique.
“Pas de Deux” (Balanchine-
Glazounov), a series of related
episodes, is pleasant enough to
see and hear —it is primarily a
showpiece designed to give the
varying groups of dancers a
chance to demonstrate their
technical equipment. As such,
it gave the two principals,
Patricia Wilde and Jacques
d’Amboise, plenty of oppor-
tunity to display some dazzling
virtuosity, with the former's
relaxed poise and ability to
finish-off a movement with a
precise delicacy sorting well
with her partner’s virility and
restrained strength.
“The Pied Piper” (Jerome
Robbins-Aaron Copland) has
practically nothing to justify
its inclusion in the repertoire.
A lone clarinettist appears on
an empty stage and begins to
play, whereupon ballet-dancers
in their practice-tights are
drawn irresistibly to the music
and throw themselves into a
variety of grotesque contortions
and swoonings.
The strongly - rhythmic
patterns of the repeated
Symphony in C, Bizet’s sole but
wholely successful venture into
that sphere, found the corps-de-
ballet in splendid form ; Diana
Adams’s dancing was notable
for the ethereal quality of her
arabesques, giving a slow-
motion-camera effect as she
was borne in a “floating”
arc by her partner. It was iff
this ballet that the true quality
of the orchestra’s work could
be gauged, and the standard
was high.

Istomin in Melbourne
When Eugen Istomin took
his delicate fingers to the key-
board at the Melbourne Town
Hall the other evening the
audience felt reasonably
justified in expecting an ex-
quisite performance. It had
read the programme, in which
Pablo Casals was described as
saying of the young American,
“Already he can take his place
among the great of the piano.”
Casals should know ; more-
over, he has backed his fancy
to the extent of giving Eugen
an annual invitation to play at
the famous Casals musical
festival in Europe. So, at the
conclusion of Istomin’s recital
of relatively well-known and
established works of great
composers, it was understand-
able that the audience was
somewhat bewildered because
its hero didn’t quite seem to
come up to its high expecta-
tions.
Hence it would be as well to
ask the question: Did Istomin
treat Melbourne to a n.ew and
deeper interpretation of the
works he performed, or did his
playing simply lapse and not
recover from the opening bars
of Haydn’s sonata onwards
owing to some temporary lack
in the operator? Some of Mel-
bourne thought the latter.
His playing throughout was
admirable technically. The
brilliance and color of many
passages and phrases in the four
Chopin nocturnes and in the
Schubert and Schumann sonatas
were astounding. Musically, the
slower movement of the oft-
rendered Beethoven “Wald-
s'tein” sonata was far more satis-
factory than the quicker. The
Beethoven work suffered most
because of Istomin’s insistence
on pace changes and shattering
tonal contrasts.
But, perhaps, the only fault
of his playing was that it was
unfamiliar, if it can be called a
fault for an artist not to con-
firm accepted standards.
Beethoven’s score is the final
arbiter of that and it does not
seem to allow for the musical
treatment dished-up on this
occasion.
It would be good to hear
from Istomin’s sensitive hands
a more imaginatively and
adventurously chosen pro-
gramme.

Emlyn Williams
Emlyn Williams went from
Dickens to Dylan Thomas with
his readings at the Assembly
Hall, Sydney, and, if it was a
less rich field, it was still rich
enough—a faultless selection,
one would imagine, that be-
came, in Williams’s expert per-
formance, a delightful and
warmly affectionate study of
Thomas and his work.
“The Outing,” a rich and up-
roarious story of a Welsh pub-
crawl finishing with the vivid
picture of a busload of happy
drunks paddling or bathing in
the moonlight, and including
the portrait of “my uncle,” like
a large red buffalo confined in
the airing cupboard, and
around whom the house
seemed to grow smaller as he
ate; “The Fight,” an em-
broidered but sensitive and
amusing glance at youth ; “Just
Like Little Dogs,” wet, dark
streets and grubby sex in the
sandhills; “Self-portrait,” a
study of adolescence; and
“Adventures in the Skin
Trade,” an immensely amusing
piece about leaving home and
going to London and the odd
characters there met —Mr.
Williams brought all these to
breathing colorful life and, as
he left the stage and echoed
back from the darkness, “Death
has no dominion,” brought a
well-nigh perfect evening to a
perfect conclusion.

Artbursts
Alison Rehfisch
The qualities which would
make Alison Rehfisch’s paint-
ings look both attractive and
distinctive in a mixed exhibi-
tion or on the walls of a home
count against them in her
exhibition at Sydney Macquarie
Galleries: so much color, all
keyed so high, becomes at once
dazzling and monotonous ; and
there is monotony, too, in the
repetition of color, form and
rhythm in the essentially
stylised landscapes.
Obviously the thing for the
artist to do, if she wishes to
avoid this effect, is to vary
the formula: which can be
done simply by a change of
scene —she is, in fact, about to
go abroad —and, wherever she
is, by a closer observation of
Nature, however she proposes
subsequently to rearrange it.
One misses, in fact, in the
present exhibition as a whole
—though there are exceptions—
a certain warmt(i and simplicity
which used to characterise the
most effective of her paintings.
All the viewer has to do, on
the other hand, is to isolate
each picture from the rest and
then it is' astonishing how well
it comes up: such striking
landscapes as “Talbingo in
Summer” or “Fishing Huts on
the Hastings,” such vivid
flowerpieces as “J anu a r y
Flowers.”
“North Coast Landscape”
with its old cottage in a, tumble
of wintry earth and “Winter
Roses” and “The First Rose of
Summer” are among the paint-
ings more deeply felt and
observed.
Sculpture for the Home
If there is nothing to strike
the mind with the force and
sensibility of a Rodin, who had
so much feeling for life as well
as for “shapes,” it is still a very
lively and engaging show of
“small sculpture for the home”
which the Society of Sculptors
has put on at David Jones,
Sydney.
It is strangely pleasing to
come out of the uproar of
Sydney’s traffic to this queer
cavern of the arts where there
are flying wooden owls and a
sandstone cat that looks like
a serpent and little bronze
stylised horses leaping straight-
up on their hind-legs and an
elongated Judas in stone that
looks like wood and a wobbly
polar-bear .in beautiful pink
marble and “sea-forms” in
black bogwood and (of course)
Henry Moore’s women scraped
bare to the backbone.
Of all the arts sculpture in
stone or bronze has the best
chance of surviving through
fire and flood and war and all
the other chances of mortal
existence, and for that reason
alone this commentator can
never really bring himself to
approve of the spiky things in
wire and spindly iron that so
many sculptors go in for. Yet
it must be admitted that there
can be both ingenuity and feel-
ing in this medium and
perhaps it will come into its
own when wrought-iron decora-
tion comes into its own again.
The most distinctive works
are those by G. F. Lewers. His
owl would find its right place
as a lectern in a church but his
“Seated Torso,” which at first
glance looks like a greenstone
Maori mere and then turns into
a back-view of a nude, would
make a lovely little thing to
have about the home.
Films
*‘Saddle the Wind”
While not approaching the
quality of “High Noon” and
“Shane,” this Western is lifted
well out of the ruck by its
attention to characterisation
and credibility. And the
scenery—cattle-plains against a
background of snow-capped
mountains—is done full justice
in Metroscope.
The story is of two brothers
—a reformed gunman (Robert
Taylor) anxious to get on with
his job of raising beef, and his
young brother (John Cassa-
vetes), a trigger-happy, vicious
killer. Following the latter's
cold-blooded killing of a
squatter who has produced his
legal title to the land on which
the cattlemen ranch, brother
is stacked against brother in a
final law-v.-lawlessness issue.
Taylor and Cassavetes are
both good, although acting
honors go to Donald Crisp as
an old rancher with a natural
dignity and a passion for fair-
ness and justice all round.

ward enhances this psychiatric
drama, based on an actual case
of a young married woman who
suffered a personality split

confidence and refinement.
The psychiatrist who takes
the case, after much patient
probing, eventually tracks the
trouble to a moment of terror
in her childhood and, though
necessarily restricted in its
action, the film is a fascinating
study of the human mind. Miss
Woodward projects herself into
each personality convincingly
enough to give the impression
that There are three distinct

The WILD CAL
COLUMN
Howard Smith, Ltd.
nrHERE was better return last year
from a number of Howard Smith’s
numerous and varied interests, and much
larger provisions for depreciation and
taxation were chiefly responsible for the
lower net profit disclosed by the consoli-
dated accounts after excluding the
amounts set aside for “future income-
tax.”
Originally a prosperous shipping-
concern, Howard Smith transferred its
fleet to the wholly-owned Australian
Steamships Pty. early in the century, and
for many years has operated mainly as
a holding- and investment-co. Bonus-
scrip accounts for £1,500,000 of the
£2,000,000 ord. capital (there is another
£250,000 in 6 p.c. prefs.), the last share-
issue occurring over 30 years ago.
Principal subsidiaries, other than Aus-
tralian Steamships, are Australian Sugar
Co. Pty., Caledonian Collieries, Ltd., and
Invincible Colliery, Ltd., the sizeable
investment-portfolio, valued in the
accounts at £1,154,084, including large
shareholdings in 8.H.P., A. Goninan and
Co. and Southern Portland Cement
In conjunction with an associated co.,
Australian Steamships set-out last term
to recapture some of the trade lost to
road-hauliers in recent years, and, with
the two new vessels received in the
previous term in full operation, the
introduction of improved inter-State
services and less-frequent industrial-
stoppages, earnings from this quarter
would appear to have improved.
Unfortunately, however, the actual
earnings of Australian Steamships and
those of its fellow-subsidiary Australian
Sugar Co. (which is reported to be
benefiting from its extensive modernisa-
tion programme) are not made public,
being included along with the figures of
other subsidiaries in the consolidated
statements put out by the parent co. On
the other hand, scrip in the partly-owned
Caledonian Collieiies and Invincible
Colliery, is listed on Australian Stock
Exchanges and the accounts of these two
cos. are published.
A weaker market for N.S.W. black
coal forced both of the coalmining-
offshoots to limit production last term,
Caledonian turning-in a £30,366-smaller
net profit (£193,475), while capital-profits'
were responsible for the £4892 improve-
ment in Invincible’s earnings (£12,064).
Variations in the amounts provided for
future income-tax affected the results in
both cases.
Investment income received by the
group as a whole rose by £7276 to
£142,130, net profit from all sources
rising by £26,610 to £317,464 after
eliminating the proportion due to outside
shareholders and setting aside £162,656
(up £79,314) for taxation, £375,653 (up
£85,154) for depreciation and £14,500
(down £108,000) for future income-tax
payable by the colliery cos. However,
if the amount provided against future
tax-liabilities is regarded as profit, net
earnings were £84,390 below those of
the previous term at £331,964:

Australian Steamships took delivery of
the new 3700-ton general-purpose vessel
Macedon last December, and, with the
outlay on the two ships received in the
previous term and a heavy expenditure
on plant, etc., by Australian Sugar and
the colliery cos., the group’s liquid
resources have shrunk over the past few
years. Nevertheless, the overall financial
structure is particularly solid, and some
improvement in the liquid position can
be expected in the current term:

The net growth in the book-value of

reduction in holdings of cash, etc., an
extra £180,140 from the bank and a
£271,557 slip in book-debts providing
portion of the funds’needed to finance the
capital-outlay and a £346,238 cut in the
amount owing to creditors.
No further additions to Australian
Steamships’ fleet are contemplated at
present, but the subsidiary and other Aus-
tralian shipowners are investigating the
“practicability” of building at least two
large bulk-carriers as a joint venture, with
an eye to sharing in the expanding iron-
ore and other “bulk” trades.
Although the immediate prospects of
both the coalmining and inter-State
shipping industries are somewhat obscure,


the potential earning-power of Howard
Smith’s investments in these fields, as well
as the co.’s substantial reserves and wide-
spread investment-portfolio, add to the
possibilities of the scrip as a long-term
proposition.

Mac. Robertson (Aust.), Ltd.
T ATEST accounts from the big
■*-' chocolate-, confectionery- and cocoa-
manufacturer, Mac. Robertson (Aus-
tralia), Ltd., reveal a 13.6 p.c. improve-
ment in net earnings, but the substan-
tial increase in the amount provided for
taxation (up 38 p.c.) would appear to be
a better guide to the extent of the co.’s
success last term.
Developing from a small- business
established by the late Sir Macpherson
Robertson in Melbourne, almost 80
years ago, the Mac. Robertson group of
cos. has occupied a prominent position
in the confectionery trade for many
years and, today, is one of the largest
organisations of its kind in Australia.
The public first, acquired a share-
interest in the business in 1950, when
shareholders in the newly-formed
holding-co., Mac. Robertson (Australia)
offered to sell 850,000 f.-p. 10s.
ords. at 16s. At the same time the hblding-
co., which had previously exchanged
3,400,000 10s. ords, for the £1,027,203
share-capital of Mac. Robertson Pty.,
raised its paid capital to £2,000,000 by
the public issue of 300,000 £ls p.c. prefs.
Since then a further 47,764 ords. have
been issued as consideration for minority
shareholders’ interests in a subsidiary
co.
Subsidiaries in the five mainland States
and local and overseas agents (in South-
east Asia, the Pacific Islands, New
Zealand, Japan, etc.) distribute the well-
known confectionery lines produced by
the group at its large Melbourne factories,
a wholly-bwned offshoot, Colorprint
Pty., turning-out the necessary cartons
and wrappers.
Work was commenced on an experi-
mental cacao-plantation near Lae, New
Guinea, in 1954, but further develop-
ment of the 1250-acre property is con-
sidered necessary before the co.’s
“ultimate prospects” of successfully
growing cacao “on a large scale, at com-
petitive prices,” can be assessed. At
present the bulk of the cocoa-beans and
cocoa-butter used by the group comes
from overseas growers, sharp and erratic
movements in the prices of these basic
raw materials causing chocolate-manu-
facturers considerable concern in recent
years.
In addition to its manufacturing- and
distributing - interests, Mac. Robertson
Pty., holds large parcels of shares in
several public and pty. cos., among which
are Australian Licorice Pty. (19.5 p.c.
share-interest), Lifeguard Milk Products,
Ltd. (15.7 p.c.), Life Savers (Australasia),
Ltd. (25.1 p.c.), Maize Products Pty.
(22.8 p.c.), Waxed Papers Pty. (50 p.c.)
and Mac.Robertson-Miller Airlines,
Ltd. (46 p.c.). The total investment in
other cos. was valued at a conservative
£480,256 at the end of last year, £217,982
of this amount relating to scrip listed
on recognised Stock Exchanges.
Output from the Mac. Robertson
factories has more than kept pace with
the 50 p.c. increase in production (volume)
reported by the Australian confectionery
industry as a whole over the last eight
years, but rising costs and keen competi-
tion have tended to narrow profit-margins,
while fluctuations in the price of cocoa-
beans, etc., have affected stock-values
and earnings. v (Avei;aging £3lO a ton for
the 1953 crop, the price of Gold Coast
cocoa-beans rose from £4BO to £670 a
ton in 1954, but dropped back to around
£250 a ton over the next two years,
only to rise again in the latter half of
last year to over £4OO a ton.)
Group-turnover reached record levels,
in both value and volume, during the
year ended December 31 last, a fall in the
average price paid for cocoa-beans and
cocoa-butter offsetting higher labor-costs
and resulting in a substantially improved
gross profit. Investment-income rose by
£432 to £51,050.
As a sharp increase in raw-material
costs is expected in the current term, the
board decided to strengthen the group’s
“competitive position” by writing-down
stocks to the extent of £40,000. Despite
this charge which could well be
regarded as an appropriation of profits
—and the heavier provisions for deprecia-
tion (up £63,380 at £193,921) and taxa-
tion (up £59,192 at £213,179), net
earnings advanced by £33,728 to
£281,312:

An increase in the ord. div.-rate, from
9 to 10 p.c., lifted the average rate since
formation of the parent co. to 8| p.c., the
larger div. compensating shareholders for
the omission of the tax-free content which
has been a feature of previous distribu-
tions. Net profit, as claimed by the
board, covered the pref div. and 15.4 p.c.
on ord. capital compared with 13.5, 13.4
and 13.2 p.c. in three years back to 1954.

In line with forecasts of higher material-
costs in the current term, an increase in
the value of raw materials bought under
forward contracts was responsible for
the additional £187,213 owing to sundry
creditors and a large part of the extra
£271,716 against stocks. New premises
in Wollongong (N.S.W.) and a building-
site at Rockhampton (Q.) were acquired
during the year and a further £16,642
spent on development of the cacao-
plantation. However, sales of plant,
etc., possibly resulting from the closing
of a factory at St. Marys (N.S.W.), and
the higher provision for depreciation,
reduced the book-value of fixed assets by
£39,809. Scrip, bought during the year
in Gibson Confectionery Pty. (W.A.) is
included with shares in other cos. (up
£26,553).
Portion of the higher costs experienced
in the current term has been passed on
to consumers by price-increases and
reductions in the weight of some
products, but these moves are unlikely
to have any noticeable effect on sales.
At 16s. 9d. the f.-p. 10s. ords. would
return £5 19s. sd. p.c. from a 10 p.c.
distribution. Net tangible cover at
December 31 last was a shade under

Century Storage Battery Co., Ltd.
OINCE the end of February, when
Century Storage Battery Co., Ltd.,
announced an increase in the interim div.
and a substantial improvement in earn-
ings for the first half of the current term,
bids for the co.’s f.-p. £1 ords. have
jumped from 48s. to 595., to return
buyers, at the higher price, £5, Is. 9d. p.c.
from a 15 p.c. div., or £5 10s. 2d. p.c.
should the 16| p.c. div.-rate be restored.
The contribs., paid to 55., are initially
cheaper at 315., but the immediate yield
is much lower and the date of future
calls uncertain. The outstanding 15s. is
payable “as and when required.”
The 30-year-old Century Storage
Battery Co. has its headquarters in
Sydney, where it manufactures a full
range of lead-acid storage-batteries,
operates a zinc-rolling mill and reclaims
rubber for use in the production of
battery-casings. The co. supplies both
local and export markets, enjoying the
whole of the Australian market for
process-engravers’ zinc.
Several new products have been

the battery range and the
development of a new tech-
nique which enables the co. to
produce guttering and down-
pipes from rolled-zinc strip.
The shares of a competing
battery - manufacturer, Erg
Industries Pty., were acquired
at the end of 1956 term at a cost
of £11,297 in scrip, issued at a
total premium of £17,934, and
a net £24,718 in cash. The
deal raised Century’s paid
capital to £386,980, the con-
tribs., issued at par in 1956 on
a one-for-seven basis, account-
ing for £25,541 of this total.
Helped by a steadily increas-
ing demand and the introduc-
tion of fresh share-capital,
earnings more than doubled
during thd five years to 1955,
but higher costs and keen
competition have slowed-down
the rate of progress in subse-
quent years, a cut in the div.-
rate, from 16| to 15 p.c.,
following last term’s increase in
capital. Gift-scrip was handed
out (two-for-three) in 1951, the
div.-rate over the seven years
to 1957 averaging a shade
over 14.5 p.c.
Although sales of batteries
reached a new peak during the
year to June 30 last, there was
a sharp fall in demand for all
of the co.’s products during the
first six months of the term,
credit restrictions and the
higher rates of sales-tax
applicable to motor vehicles
and motor-vehicle parts con-
tributing to the decline. A
marked improvement in trade
over the latter half of the term
permitted an almost complete
recovery and, at £72,824, the
published net profit fell short
of the previous term’s record
figure by only £3205, after
providing £54,650 (down £2600)
for taxation and £33,988 (up
£3150) for depreciation:

However, there was, in fact,
a small improvement in earn-

tion was calculated on the rates
applying prior to the last
Budget, the excess provision
amounting to approximately
£3450. As claimed, the profit
represented 18.8 p.c. on the
larger capital (all in ords.)
compared with 21.7, 21.5, 17.9
and 17.8 p.c. back to 1953.
If the healthy state of the

From Herbert Holman
r THE conviction that retro-
spective legislation is, at
all times, bad legislation will
probably cause the Cabinet to
have second thoughts about
the tax-avoiding device known
as “dividend-stripping.” An
army of back-benchers, indig-
nantly quoting “The Times’s”
condemnatory leading-article,
is determined that a Con-
servative Government shall
not have its conscience sullied
by such reprehensible practice
—amounting, in fact, to pen-
alising someone for a course
of action which, at the time it
was carried-out, was perfectly
legal.
It is a nice issue, analogous
to “If you choose to play dirty,
chum, so can I.” The Govern-
ment budgets for faxes. The
intended victims, brilliantly
aided by accountants, solicitors
and perspicacious laymen, take-
up the challenge according to
the dictum that “it is every
citizen’s duty to himself and
his family so to order his
affairs that they attract the
least possible taxation.” Never
was there a struggle more quiet,
more dignified, more resolute
and more continuous than this
one. Since no Act of Parlia-
ment can be watertight and all-
comprehensive, vast sums of
money, theoretically due in
taxation, are lost to the
revenue. And by the time the
dodges are open to counter-
attack it is too late ; the
plunderers are safe.
Of course, if everybody paid
his taxes according to the
Spirit of the thing there would
be no problem. But people
are human and, where money
is concerned, extremely reluc-
tant to let it go. The higher
the incidence of income-tax
and surtax, the more will they
fall back upon their ingenuity.
The Chancellor’s concern, no
doubt, is less with the retro-
spective losses than with deter-
ring the wary from embarking
upon fresh schemes by imply-
ing that, in the end, they may
have to pay - back their
dubiously-gotten gains. To
throw away the rules and play
“dirty” too is, it seems, the
only way of avoiding being
outwitted.
This whole business of
“ordering affairs” has become,
if not a science, a preoccupa-
tion often more important than
seeking a straightforward profit.
Nobody nowadays gets rich by
hard work and good husbandry
alone. The ordinary bloke
who works that bit harder than
the next is, indeed, to be pitied.
So, for that matter, is the
author or actor who hits sudden
fame. Surtax, even when spread
over three years, eats-away his
good fortune.
That is why, on the face of it,
the shrewd are comparatively
poorly paid. Offer them £20,000
a year and they will recoil. A
mere £5OOO and “the usual
accompaniments” is much mote
attractive. Yet this amounts
only to a good standard of
living at executive level. It will
not enable a man to make his
fortune. But if he can combine
an ability for complex
manoeuvre with the patience to
take a long-term view he can
still amass great wealth.
The essence of the matter is
simplicity itself: to convert
heavily-taxable income into
tax-free capital - appreciation.
“Ploughing-back and selling-
out,” takeover bids and the
ingenious 'fiddles that depend
upon loopholes in successive
Finance Acts all have this
objective in common.
A New Comedist
John Mortimer, a 35-year-old
lawyer and novelist, has burst
into the theatre with an irrepres-
sible verve that recalls the
early George Bernard Shaw.
The two plays that make-up
the double-bill at the Lyric,
Hammersmith, are not, it is fair
to say, master-works and break
no new ground by their impact,
although one, “Dock Brief,”
has won a radio award and, in
a television adaptation, has been
performed in several European
countries.
Comedy, affirms Mortimer,
is “the only thing worth
writing in this despairing age,
providing it is. truly on the
side of the lonely, the neglected
and the unsuccessful, and plays
its part in the long war against
established rules and against
the imposing of an arbitrary
code of behavior on free and
unpredictable human beings.”
There is room in our theatre,
at present in an exciting period
of transition, for such icono-
clastic attitudes, the more so
for their being backed by a
profusion of ideas, an incisive
power of observation and a
buoyant sense of fun. And it
is refreshing, too, that the
power of the author is coming
back.
“Dock Brief” is a little gem
of satirical comedy in which
a down - at - heel barrister
gambles his long of
failure and his unfulfilled
imaginings on a last chance —
a convict who murdered his
wife (because she never
stopped laughing) and who
admits without repentance to
his crime.
In the prison cell, the bar-
rister rehearses his defence,
putting into it all the forensic
artifices of shock, persuasion
and surprise that he has
learned at second-hand. A
gentle twist in the tail only
confirms his failure as utterly
shattering. While the prisoner
is no more than a puppet,
though a comic and lovable
one, the barrister is rooted in
life. There is genuine pathos
in his successive brainwaves, in
his learning and “know-how,”
and in the evident distress that
comes with the self-knowledge
that each trick won’t work and
that he is too far-gone in
failure ever to come to the
surface.
The second play, “What
Shall We Tell Caroline?”, will
soon be forgotten. It is (purely
in the Shavian sense) an
unpleasant comedy of man-
ners in which a stupid martinet
of a' headmaster storms and
rants, his much-suffering wife
(whom he looks upon as a
“companion for a walking-tour ;
through life”) dallies harm-
lessly with his assistant, an
ageing charmer, and the 18-
year-old daughter, Caroline,
refuses to speak a word until
she leaves home for nothing
more exciting than a job in
a London bank. The drama-
tic structure, though intended
as pungent social comment,
completely fails to click, but
the play serves well enough as
a vehicle for old-fashioned
gusto, explosive laughter and
uninhibited acting.
Michael Hordern and
Maurice Denham appear with
distinction in both plays,
alternating the principal roles.
In the second play Brenda
Bruce gives excellent support
as the numbed wife.
High Fantastical
The Old Vic “Twelfth
Night” is superb, very nearly
definitive. Michael Benthall
has caught the essence of this
loveliest of comedies by the
pale, wistful melancholy which
overhangs his production and
stays to haunt the memory like
a Dowland song.
For tenderness the Viola of
Barbara Jefford is unsur-
passed ; her transparent inno-
cence brings the part to life
and she is real and credible,
even in boy’s clothes. Derek
Godfrey’s Feste has both the
tragic mask of Pagliacci and
the unrequited love of Jack
Point giving, witn sweet sad-
ness, the play its key. Wel-
come, too, is an Agiiecheek
who is not embarrassingly
silly ; John Neville’s interpre-
tation achieves the right
balance by a mixture of gravity
and a communicated sense of
inferiority.
It is a pity that the comic
scenes are primed with every
trick out of the bag and are
put-over with the patronising
touch of a conjurer at an
infants’ party. Moreover, Paul
Daneman’s whimsy is unsuit-
able for Sir Toby, and the
Brummagem accent affected
by Judi Dench ruins an other-
wise adequate Maria.
The Vic needs to be box-
office conscious (as witness the
magnificent new extension),
but this is going altogether too
far.

Wonder-Dog
By JOHN GILMORE
THE stockmen first learned
of the dog from a
young man who walked
into their noon camp at
Sulieman.
“This dog’s a wonderful
worker—an all-sation. Cleverest
dog J ever see . . .” But this
was later.
Sweeney, he called himself.
Henry* Charlie and Bill Dodds
and Jack the overseer guessed
he was of the drifting, droving
Sweeneys from the sunbaked
railhead-settlement 50 miles
along the winding Gulf-
country road, a rutted track
over which the powdered
red dust hung endlessly,
shimmered-througn with ever-
lasting heat-haze.
A bay horse had thrown
Sweeney.
“Terrible good cut of a leggy
bay colt. I only rid him once,
been savin’ him for a big day
mustering, when I could gallop
the guts out of him and quieten
him proper. Brushed me off
against a carbeen down the
creek.” The stranger gestured
with a work-crabbed hand to
where, across the bare claypan,
the eucalypt-fringed, sandy
creekbed snaked southwards.
When Sweeney accepted
Henry’s grey mare, an un-
handsome, shaggy stock-horse
with large, unshod hooves,
Henry said casually, “She
roots a bit.”
“You think we should tell
him to look-out for her?”
Jack the overseer asked doubt-
fully of Charlie, as the young
man was about to mount.
Clad like the rest in grey
moleskins, sweat-streaked shirt,
riding-boots and greasy wide-
brimmed hat, the stranger
stood well forward by the grey,
right fist bunched on pommel,
left drawing the near-rein tight,
bringing the mare’s blunt
muzzle almost to his spurred
heel. With this hand he grasped
the near-ear, screwing down
and back so that the animal’s
whole unwilling body twisted
towards him ; as his right foot
left the ground to swing across
her back and she shied, the
movement was towards him and
threw him firmly into the
saddle, where he had planned
to be.
“He’ll manage,” Charlie told
Jack.
Sweeney located his run-
away colt arid yarded him late
by the old dip near Sulieman
Waterhole. When he hobbled-
out the borrowed grey and
mounted the colt, that terrible
good cut of a horse tried
desperately for 20 minutes
to deposit him on the claypan
near the camp. It was a lively,
entertaining ride, with Sweeney
sitting loosely in good balance,
smoking the traditional rough-
rider’s cigarette as the bay-
reared and twisted beneath him.
Before he left to ride into
the darkness on a subdued bay
colt, Sweeney shared the camp’s
boiled salt-beef and four-day-
old, wind-dried town-bread,
pickled onions, tea and apricot-
jam. It was then he spoke of
the all-sation.
“Terrible good worker, this
all-sation,” he told them.
It was by far the brightest
dog he had. ever seen. It was
an Einstein of a dog, with
strength and endurance enough
for 10 sheepdogs. Even the
kelpies, serious, intent, work-
eagered bodies huddled beyond
the campfire, seemed absorbed.
Henry, too was silent. Dogs
were vital, with the party
combing Mr. Hennery’s 40-
mile paddock for the sheep they
were to overland from Bucking-
ham Downs to Rosevale, near
Kynuna. Against the muted,
tinny bells of the grazing
stock-horses, Sweeney went on:
“This hound is just a lot of
good dog going to waste in
Dajarra. There’s no sheep there
for him to work. Should be
working woollies . . .”
The only stock the all-sation
had to spend his energy on in
Dajarra were goats, Sweeney
said. Dajarra common grazed
over 200 goats, from the station-
master’s two prize-milkers to
34 of Yeller Nellie’s, the
half-caste crone who resided
with Eric the Fettler under
canvas beyond the railway-
lines. Every afternoon the all-
sation worked the herd,
Sweeney said, rounding-up the
whole number on the common,
searching-out stragglers ; then,
gently and firmly and compe-
tently, he divided them into
their mobs before patiently
driving each little lot to their
respective homes, until the
common was deserted.
TN days following, Mr.
Hennesy’s men often dis ■
cussed the all-sation. Henry
was most impressed.
“Y’ know,” he drawled more
than once, “I’ve never had a
good sheepdog. A man’s life’d
be a lot.more comfortable with
a decent hound.”
Sheep ready to travel, Mr.
Hennesy visited the camp at
Sulieman. Jack the overseer
drove-off with him to the
homestead for final orders,
returning alone in his em-
ployer’s utility-truck ; arrange-
ments were to be made in town.
As the four men bumped into
the bleak little settlement in
the vehicle, Henry had made
a decision.
“Leaving that all-sation in
Dajarra would be a proper
crime,” he said. Then dis-
gustedly, “Wasting his talents
on jolly goats.”
All agreed it would be,
indeed.
Jack left the party at Fasil
Deen’s, the Hindu store-
keeper’s, while he sought a
permit from the police-con-
stable to move 15,000 sheep
along the stock-routes. There
would be less than 15,000,
but the mobs they handled
for Mr. Hennesy had
an unaccountable habit of
accumulating, and it was as well
to be on the safe side. When
he returned to Fasil Deen’s the
Dodds brothers were carrying
out stores.
“We could have some beer at
this stage,” said Bill Dodds;
“if there was a pub.”
“Where’s Henry?’’ said Jack.
“Henry said to wait on the
edge of the common,” Charlie
hefted a sack onto ‘the back of
the loaded utility. “Said he
won’t be long.”
As the three smoked in the
laden vehicle, where the road
slanted up through the rocky
outcrops towards Sulieman,
Henry joined them. High-
heeled boots scuffling the red
dust, he walked quickly, leading
on a short length of frayed
rope the largest dog any of
them had ever seen.
He was a fine-looking dog, an
enormous dog, yellow and
white and black and brown,
lantern-jawed and powerful;
long, flat muscles rippled
beneath the wire-stiff coat as
he ambled on ponderous feet.
The rope might have been
twine, and the dog appeared to
the watchers to dwarf Henry,
too.
Wordlessly, Jack let down the
tailboard while the others,
struggling, lifted the all-sation
aboard. The great animal
grinned sleepily around, then
disposed himself comfortably
on piled bags and crates. Henry
joined him there, seating him-'
self on a half-bag of the
Hindu’s aged potatoes, cradling
the massive canine head in his
lap.
It was a silent drive back to
camp. Only once, when they
slowed to bump through a dry
washout known as Afflick’s
Mistake, did Henry exult:
“What odds! ” they heard
him cry. “We’ll put a bend in
them blanky wool-blind wethers

A pool in the
Waingongoro
By DOUGLAS STEWART
THE very name of the
Waingongoro is enough,
as Rilke says some-
where of some other
river, to fill all my conscious-
ness with sparkling water . . .
though I suppose you would
need to have been born in
Eltham to be able to pro-
nounce it —Wy - nong - oro,
with the accent on the second
syllable.
It means “Snoring Water”
and is supposed to have been
so named because at the
mouth, near Hawera, twelve
miles away from my own
territory, Turi, the ancient
Maori navigator, camped a
night there with his canoe the
Tainui and, semi-mythological
hero though he was, snored.
But it is not its history that
endears the name to me; it
is the sound ; it is a bubbling,
shingly, boulder - rumbling,
altogether rivery sort of word,
and even when we shortened
it in boyhood to the useful
monosyllable of “the Wong”
it still has a pleasant, deep,
plonking sound, like a stone
dropped in a pool . . . The
Wong!
And the Wong, the long-
rippling Waingongoro, is
indeed a bubbling, shingly,
boulder-rumbling, plonking,
altogether rivery sort of river.
It is shaded with willows. It
is thronged with watercress.
It smells of mint. It is a small
stream, clear, steadily run-
ning, perpetually winding
round low cliffs or tall dry
banks into pools and shallow
rapids, and pool and rapid
again round the next bend,
all the way down through the
green paddocks from Egmont
to the sea. The willows spread
their fibrous red roots into
the runnels; ferns' and the
dark-green glossy leaves of the
tutu-scrub glimmer in the
water-lights on the cliffs ; sand
and shingle lie golden in the
pools and grey on the beaches.
It tastes of snow, earth and
sunlight.
1 wish now, for the satis-
faction of knowing every inch
of it, that 1 had tracked it to
its source somewhere high up
on that gigantic pyramid of
forest and stone and snow that
filled the western sky; or at
least that 1 had fished it close
to the mountain as I fished the
Kapuni and the Mangahume;
but if I never knew precisely
in what enchanted wellspring
it first bubbled through the
stones below the hanging ice,
in what white cascade it fell
headlong through the bush to
the plain of Taranaki, nor in
what tiny x pools and rapids
among the gorges where snow
still lay upon the moss it first
began to be fishable, I knew
that sort of country well
enough; and once it fairly
became,a river, wandering out
near Stratford to turn south for
Eltham and the coastline near
Hawera, I did indeed know
every pool of it, almost every
willow and every pebble: the
deep water, silent under
willows, south of the town
where George Batchelor and
Fin Maslin used to catch the
six-pounders ; the shallows up-
stream near Stratford, down
the bank of which I sometimes
walked all the way home to
Eltham when I was a reporter
on the Stratford “Evening
Post”; and, above all, that
exquisite midway water,
neither too large nor too small,
from Chiselhurst to Finnerty
Road, where our picnic-pool
was.
That would be, I suppose,
about three miles of the wind-
ing river. Something memor-
able must have happened
along every yard of it.
There was, for instance, the
day lan Wylds and I ate the
bait; something that still
strikes me as irresistibly
comic, though all we did was
to cook and devour a piece of
scrapmeat we had got for eel-
fishing from Alf Ware the
butcher.
For more serious eeling we
would go to the Black Creek,
that sinister drainage-channel
in boggy country south of the
town, in useful proximity to
the septic tank, where the
dark, slimy creatures
flourished in profusion. But
these eels from the Black
Creek we despised as fodder.
We called them yellow bellies
and took them home only to
be cooked for the fowls: and
an indescribably foul smell
they made, too, boiling in the
big iron pot on the kitchen
stove.
For eels to eat ourselves, we
favored the silverbellies from
the clean Waingongoro, and
on that day lan and I must
have intended to cook and eat
them on the spot, for we took
no lunch with us; and, while
the meat on our hooks bled
white in the water, grew hun-
grier and hungrier; and looked
avidly upon the bait, and
smelled it —and it smelled very
richly—and debated it and, in
such an ecstasy of nausea and
Rabelaisian delight as only
small boys can know, ate it.
Dimly 1 see us still, two
brown, small boys roiling on
the stones with roars of dis-
gust and joy while the smoke
from our lire of willow-twigs
drifted across the river in the
sunlight.
There was the time when,
a mile or so downstream from
the picnic-pool, on a grassy
and willowy flat where a low
ridge sloped down to meet
dark water swirling against a
cliff, we camped for a summer-
holidays, my sister Jean and I
and the Carter girl and boy,
Wray and Desmond ... of
which glorious 'adventure I
can remember only how
startled we were one night
when our parents drove down
to see, how were getting on
and interrupted our compara-
tively innocent but enthusiastic
good - night embraces with
the girls a ritual which
had not been provided for in
the parental programme; and
how white, like naiads or like
fish, the girls looked when
wickedly one afternoon we
peered through the tutu-scrub
at them while they were bath-
ing naked; and how tremen-
dously Jean and I quarrelled
one day, over Lord knows
what, when either she attacked
me or I attacked her with
the toasting-fork and I ran
home to Eltham and had to
be ignominiously driven back
to the camp by my mother.
There was the day when, in
that same pool of the holiday-
camp, Fred Vincent gave me
my first lesson in trout-fishing.
It should have been the
supreme occasion of my life,
but, alas, I remember it as an
anticlimax.


A great and a most ardent
fisherman was Fred Vincent,
the jeweller ; and a most kindly
soul, too, with grins of
encouragement covering his
round, weather-beaten face as
he taught a small boy how to
assemble his rod and tie his
cast, how to put on his lead-shot
to take the bait to the bottom,
how to find a “creeper” under
a stone and, disregarding its
justly indignant pincers, impale
it on the hook ; how to cast
out gently where the current
ran deep there against the edge
of the cliff and where—“By
jove, now! Look at that now,
Alec!” (to my father) —a fine
trout was rising just at that
moment.
It was too much for Fred.
He grabbed my rod and fished
for it himself. And, although
a rising trout had no business
to be taking a creeper, got a
tug from it, too. Having since
taught a novice or two myself,
I can now understand how
overwhelming was the tempta-
tion to which he submitted ;
and I take this belated oppor-
tunity—years ago he fell over
a cliff into the sea, snapper-
fishing at Urenui, and died of
pneumonia of * forgiving
him....
There was the day when,
wandering through the last
patch of native bush left at
Chiselhurst for shelter for the
cattle or the few old ewes that
were sometimes imported to
these dairying-pastures to have
their last lambs, I heard among
the ferns, the supple-jack vines,
the mossy stumps and the
ancient, storm-beaten white-
pines the blackbirds making
that high-pitched, furious com-
motion which is their warning-
signal of a cat or a weasel in
the neighborhood “jennet-
ting,” Nigel Connel the
painter-photographer used to
call it; a jennetting blackbird
—and suddenly, when I was
investigating, a monstrous
great yellow hare sprang from
her form on a cushion of moss
and raced to safety down the
trail the cattle had trodden
through the undergrowth. And
in that same patch of bush
one howling day of July—for
I used to prowl the river winter
and summer alike —I saw a
new-born lamb that made itself
into a poem for me: so glisten-
ing white like the frosts it
would still have to endure
before the buds on the bare
willows turned into the first
green leaflets ; so frail against
the darkness of that stormy
Taranaki dusk.
Somewhere along that spark-
ling stretch of the river was
the cliff where the wild duck
—the grey duck of New
Zealand, called the black duck
in Australia —had the nest to
which she returned season after
season, where her eggs clustered
like pebbles of jade in their
hollow of grass and down from
the mother’s breast. Once on
a misty grey dawn when I was
fishing below that cliff the most
curious shapes, like water-rats,
raced past my legs in the
water: the wild duck and her
ducklings swimming under-
water to evade me.
And just round the bend
from the wild-duck’s nest was
the run where my winter
explorations paid a most rare
and excellent, dividend.
It was a place where the
stream ran fast and a fairly
big rock divided it into two.
Not more than four or five
feet deep at most, a ragged bit
of water unfishable under the
willows, it was a place that
normally you would just have
passed by. But, clambering
round fhe bare trunk of a
willow one sunny winter's
afternoon, I discovered exactly
where the trout lurked in
that awkward spot: in the lee
of the rock, safe from the
currents on either side and,
with both rock and willow to
protect them, pretty well safe
from a fisherman. Like fish
in a crystalline spring, a nest
of whirlpools vand bubbles
isolated from the 5 flowing
waters, I could see them
there nuzzling the golden sand ;
the dark-brown backs, the flash
of a tawny speckled side as
they turned, three or four
most noble trout —so far as
trout in that reach of the
Waingongoro went, which was
never above three-pounds at
the outside, and mostly about
a pound-and-a-half.
The only way to fish for
them, if it were possible at
all, would be to scramble
through the willow-branches
as I did then, hang out over
the stream at the great risk
of scaring them, and just
drop the worm or the
<?reeper on top of them—
the fly was beyond me then
—as if you were fishing
for mere simpletons of fish,
like eels or cockabullies in
a rock-pool. And come the
spring, and the first faint
green of the breaking buds
on the bare twigs of the
willows that hung like harp-
strings over that swift-running
water, I did thus insinuate my-
self through the branches, and
poke my rod out before me,
and drop a creeper weighted
with lead-shot, down into that
bubbling whirlpool; and
instantly got a strike and,
playing my fish with I know
not what wild excitement
around the rock and in the
current while I balanced as
best I could on branches that
dipped into the water, landed
a fine two-pounder. Such are
the rewards of constancy.
But now when I think back
on those delectable miles of
the Waingongoro from
Egmont to the sea, from
Ngaere down to Chiselhurst,
it all seems to coalesce, to
crystallise, in that one little
central pool where we had our
family picnics.
It was an insignificant pool,
one among a thousand ; but
like the dusty cavern under
the veranda at home where
you could crawl to search for
pennies dropped through the
cracks between the planks,
like the fort we made of an
old tin washtub among the
loganberries at the far end of
the fowlrun, like the mysteri-
ous caves and the pool where
Des Carter nearly got drowned
on the Town Creek, it was
one of those places, as vital
and intimate as the solar-
plexus, where the whole exist-
ence of boyhood finds its
centre.
It was there, on some
infinitely remote day of my
boyhood, that I discovered I
could swim; “walking” along
the pebbles on my hands and
suddenly finding that, if you
lifted your hands for a second
or two and dog-paddled,
there was no real need to sink
to the bottom. It was there
that, having mastered the dog-
paddle, I learned how thrilling
it was to wade into the current
at the head and race down
with it into the pool, partak-
ing of its swiftness as if you
were part of the water
yourself.
It was there that —though
for more serious blackberry-
ing we would go to Cheat
Road, where the bushes grew
man-high over the tree-stumps
of the Ngaere swamp—many
a day < we filled the fire-
blackened picnic-billy with
those glistening fruits, eating
as we picked and staining
purple our hands and our
mouths. It was there ' that
one notable day I dragged a
nettle across the back of my
father’s hand as he lay dozing
under the willows ... I take
it as a remarkable example
of his courtesy that, though
he jumped to his feet with a
roar, he took no further action,
while I stood poised for flight
over the paddocks, but merely
apologised for the roar, saying
mysteriously that he thought
it was the kind of nettle that
stung. It was.
It was there that, on I don’t
know how many glorious
Saturdays and Sundays fa
multitude of them) we drove
in the ancient cream Buick
which my father bought
second - hand from Mick
McGarry, the land - agent
(after, I think, Mick had
landed it on top of the big
boxthorn hedge on the way
to the golf-links)— a> car we
thought so superb with its
silver lion on the radiator that
we named it, after fierce argu-
ment, “Beauty”—and boiled
the billy with a stick float-
ing in it “to draw the
smoke,” and ate such
marvellous foods as
tomatoes stuffed with
salmon, and savory-eggs
each in its leaf of lettuce
. . . and sunbaked on the
warm sand, and swam and
fished for eels, and climbed
the trees for birds’-nests
and looked under stones
for the odd creatures that
lived there; and lived like
water-creatures ourselves, the
two active boys, the three
graceful girls, and our parents
at ease in the green shade of
the willows.
Under the big stone that
jutted into the pool from the
far bank, to whose grey side
we so often clung when we
desperately dog-paddled the
full five yards of the river and
from whose sunny top we so
often dived our first splashing
“belly-busters,” lived, as after-
wards we found-out to our
consternation, the father of
all the eels, a monstrous great
slimy creature five-feet long,
22-pounds in weight, 16-inches
round the girth—how these
proud statistics do glitter in
the memory!—which, though
not in the tranquillity of a
family picnic, was to provide

Delocalised Government
The Renshaw Plan
IT is nearly a dozen years since The
Bulletin first accused the N.S.W.
Labor Government of pursuing a
deliberate policy of “taking the local
out of local-government.” Every year
since then additional evidence has piled-
up to demonstrate the truth of the charge.
The Sydney metropolitan area was
given the treatment 10 years ago, when
half the municipalities disappeared from
the map through compulsory mergers
with their neighbors. At that time the
technique had not been perfected and
some of the more vigorous of the pro-
testingv corporations were able to save
their bacon—though they are continually
being reminded that they were merely
reprieved. Greater Sydney is still the
goal.
In the country the number of areas
affected runs into dozens. Shires and
municipalities have been combined to
form cities ; shires have absorbed muni-
cipalities and municipalities have
absorbed shires, but always the net result
has been that one or more local-govern-
ment area has disappeared and a much
larger one has emerged. And it is
axiomatic that the bigger the area of the
unit the less local its government can be
—which means that the personal influence
of its elected representatives must wane
and the power of its paid officers grow,
and with it the power of the Local
Government Department and Minister.
Negation of Democracy
TT is not suggested that local-govern-
ment boundaries should be immut-
able, any more than it is suggested that
England should revert to the wapentakes
of Anglo-Saxon days, but an essential of
true local-government is consultation
with the governed ; it is a negation of
democracy to make drastic changes in
an area without ascertaining and respect-
ing the wishes of those affected by them.
Until the advent of the Cahill-Renshaw
overlordship this principle was embodied
in the N.S.W. Local Government Act;
a referendum of ratepayers was required
before any such changes could be made.
This barrier in the path of the Socialist
planners was unobtrusively removed in
1945, leaving the way clear for the
onward march of the bureaucrats.
Of the amalgamations and absorptions
that have been arranged since then some
have been good moves and some have
been welcomed by the people of the
areas. Some have even been both.
But the great majority have been
neither good nor welcome.
In the City of Sydney civic pride is
at the lowest ebb in decades; the City
of the Blue Mountains, which sprawls
along the Western Highway like an
uneven string of beads, was thrust upon
its citizens unsought, and if its title-deeds
were torn-up and thrown over Echo Point
not even the Three Sisters would mourn.
In 1947 the shires of Bulli, Central
Illawarra, North lllawarra and Wollon-
gong were squeezed together to form
the City of Greater Wollongong. At the
time of the last local-government elections
the people of Greater Wollongong voted
27,572 to 9319 in favor of reverting to
smaller areas.
No notice has been, or will be, taken
of this expression of opinion, but the
figures speak for themselves. So do
those recorded at the same time ia
Randwick, a city municipality which has
so far escaped absorption into Sydney,
b.ut is still under threat. Randwick people
voted 33,587 to 12,775 in favor ,of
remaining masters of their own affairs,
but despite that they feel far from safe.
The shire of Shoalhaven, created in
1948 by the fusion of the municipalities
of Berry and Broughton’s Vale, Nowra,
South Shoalhaven and Ulladulla and the
shires of Cambewarra and Clyde, is now
in the hands of an administrator. There’s
no suggestion of maladministration ; it’s
just that the area has proved too cumber-
some for the council to manage. And
that is just what critics of the plan
predicted from the start.
In many parts of the State ratepayers,
having seen how the Minister has ridden
roughshod over opposition to his plans,
have taken the attitude that it is useless
to make a stand against any Renshaw-
sponsored proposals. This attitude can
be summed-up: “What’s the use of fight-
ing? It’s all cut-and-dried, and nothing
we can say or do will alter it.”
The feeling is quite understandable;
the long list of amalgamations that
were engineered between January 1, 1947,
when Tweed shire and Murwillumbah
municipality were merged, and January
1, 1958, when Upper Hunter shire and
the municipality of Scone were joined in
unwanted wedlock, is not calculated to
encourage resistance-movements. At the
same time it is nothing short of tragic
to see whole districts submitting without
a murmur to the edicts of bureaucracy
and exchanging their title to true local-
government for a sham copy of it—and
all in the name of progress.
Prepared to Fight
■pORTUNATELY there are some dis-
tricts where men still value their
democratic rights and are prepared to
put up a fight for them. Beyond the Blue
Mountains the long-range objective of the
Renshaw Plan is undoubtedly a huge
regional-council area stretching from
Lithgow to Orange and beyond—an area
in which local-government will have lost
all meaning except as a branch of the
centralised Government in Sydney. As
the penultimate step towards this end the
Minister’s current plans are to extend
greatly the city boundaries of Orange,
Bathurst and Lithgow, wiping-out in the
process the shires of Canoblas and Blax-
land and amalgamating the shires of
Abercrombie and Turon.
This plan was announced oh April 3,
six months after two departmental
officers had visited the area “to get a
general picture of things,” but it is doubt-
ful whether it would have differed much
if they had never left Sydney.
The shire of Canoblas has for over a
year been resisting a move for its absorp-
tion into the Orange municipality. When
the former mayor of Orange made the
proposal in December, 1956, the opposi-
tion of shire residents was vehement and
spontaneous. All over Canoblas shire
protest-committees were formed—l 7 in
all—and they shortly combined into the
Canoblas Shire Defence Organisation
with upwards of 1800 members.
People do not rally to a cause in
numbers of those dimensions unless they
have been profoundly stirred, and the
enthusiasm of the farmers and orchardists
of Canoblas shire gives the lie to those
who say that local-government will die-
out by default. At a public meeting held
in Orange to protest against the proposal
876 ratepayers turned-up. These numbers,
of course, meant nothing to Renshaw. His
officers presented their plan after visiting
seven shires and three municipalities in
three days. There can be little doubt that
the plan was, in fact, compiled before
they even left Sydney.
Inquiries and investigations don’t seem
to cut much ice with the Minister for
Delocalising Government. Some time ago
the City of Bathurst applied to have its
area extended to include parts of Turon
and Abercrombie shires. A commissioner
was appointed by the Minister, and his
report recommended that certain limited
areas should be added to Bathurst. The
Minister disregarded the recommenda-
tion, and when representatives of
Bathurst, Turon and Abercrombie
councils went to Sydney to discuss the
matter with him Renshaw opened pro-
ceedings with the remark that he was not
going to allow any discussion on the
commissioner’s report, but that he had
proposals of his own to make.
After that, it is easy to believe the
story of another commissioner sent out
to report oh a Far Western area and who
listened to proposals of the local repre-
sentatives and admitted they were sound.
He then added, “But it’s no use putting
that in my report. He wouldn’t take any
notice of it.”
Some of the enthusiasm and indigna-
tion of Canoblas shire has spilled-over
into adjoining shires, and a big public
meeting is to be held in Bathurst at which
ratepayers from all the areas affected
will be given a chance to say what they
think of the latest Renshaw plan. The
Orange meeting is believed to have been
the biggest held in a N.S.W. country
town for many years, but the organisers
of the Bathurst meeting hope to eclipse it.
Time is running out, but the men
behind this new freedom-movement in
the Central West hope that even now it
isn’t too late for a successful last-ditch
stand. At any rate, they’re prepared to
give it a go.

Sydney Racing
On Saturday Gregory John
won-two races at the Warwick
Farm meeting, to equal the feat
of Belmont Park at Rosehill on
July 31, 1954. The latter, inci-
dentally, wasn’t of much
account after that dual success.
Gregory John won ' , the
Encourage and Welter Handi-
caps, each time being ridden
by apprentice R. Williams. In
the restricted event he carried
Bst., and in the Welter 8.10.
Williams rode two well-judged
races. Gregory John is raced
by Frank Donohoe and trained
by his brother Johnnie, who in
earlier years had won daily
doubles with Delara at Canter-
bury and with jumper Bibben-
luke at Moorefield. Gregory
John could prove a useful
stayer in the coming staying-
season.

Last October Jazz Singer won
a Two-year-old race at Rose-
hill in easy fashion and then
was spelled. He reappeared at
Randwick on April 7, when he
started at 100 to 1 in a field
of 23 and beat four home.
Smart trackwork at Randwick
and the presence of G. Moore
in the saddle helped to keep
him at a short price (6 to 4)
once betting settled down for
the Warwick Farm Juvenile
Handicap, and, sure enough,
the gelded son of Damnos (Fr.)
and Regal Gold won it in easy
fashion.
• • • •
Class generally tells in
racing—but not always. For
example, Teranyan’s past record
overshadowed that of his
opponents in the Warwick
Farm Flying Handicap, and he
was confidently supported from
5-to-2 to evens. For a horse
of his class his performance was
well below expectations, and
maybe the stable will now con-
centrate upon races longer than
six furlongs. Teranyan could
be well placed over a middle-
distance and he might quickly
rejoin the winning-list when
raced beyond the six of the
Warwick Farm event.
Wagga Maiden Handicap
winner Barrow Boy is trained
at Rosebery by Sid Nicholls,
who later the same day won
the Improvers’ Handicap with
Bob’s Son. Barrow Boy’s time,
59f, was a race-record. He
won by seven lengths. Both
winners were ridden by Fred
Hood. Maybe Barrow Boy will
now act in keeping with his
first win and score in better
company in Sydney. He cost
475gns. as a yearling at the
1956 sales at Randwick-and is
a three-year-old by Newtown
Pippin (imp.) from Hunter
Belle.
Former Brisbane mentor
Dick Roden on successive
Saturdays at Sydney meetings
“He'd clock me if I allowed his dial to be photographed
as it is.”
won the main distance-event.
Prince Dante won at Rosehill
and Macdougal had an easy
task in the 11-furlongs Warwick
Farm May Handicap. Both
horses were weighted for Tatter-
sail’s big-money Centenary
Cup at Randwick on Saturday
next, and maybe Prince Dante
will be the stable representative.
Other top horses engaged -in
that Cup include Monte Carlo,
Theodric, Ter any an and Lord
Cynara. Macdougal won four
races in the autumn and the
winter of last year, but failed
badly in the A.J.C. Metro-
politan Handicap. However,
he is bred on staying lines, and
may go on to win an important
long-distance event.
El Rocco, a Kembla special-
ist —he has won a number of
races there —came from the
rear of the field to win the
Three-year-old Novice at War-
wick Farm. Trained by Darby
Munro, the black gelding had
also won at his prior start, the
Kembla First Improvers seven.
He is a well-bred three-year-
old by Damtar (Fr.) from La
Duchess by Le Grand Due
(Fr.),' and cost 1300gns. as a
yearling.
A. D. Webster, a veteran
New Zealand trainer who has
had many Australian successes,
added to his list when No Boots
won the Warwick Farm Flying
Handicap with a lucky run
alongside the rails, to beat
Aura a head with Royal King-
dom a short head away third.
Time, 1.121, was moderate.
No Boots has won half-a-dozen
Sydney races, four of them
in the autumn of last year.
The 23,500 attendance at
Warwick Farm was well up to
average for a May fixture.
Each enclosure was well pat-
ronised, three favorites won in
seven races, and the other four
had good backing. Weather
conditions were ideal. Maybe
the attendance would have been
even greater had there not
been counter-attractions such
as the Soccer-match between
Blackpool and Australia, and
the King’s Cup rowing. The
A.J.C. should finish Warwick
Farm meetings much earlier
than 4.45 p.m. There seemed
nothing to have prevented last
Saturday’s meeting starting at
12.45 instead of 1 p.m. The
late finish makes it far too late
when some patrons get back
to the city.

Each season more and more
two-year-olds are racing in
Brisbane. Bloodstock agents
buy many yearlings at the Syd-
ney sales as well as some in
Melbourne and in N.Z. for
Queensland owners. There
were so many youngsters avail-
able for racing at the Doom-
ben fixture on Saturday that the
club staged four events for two-
year-old maidens. Respective
winners of the Doomben races
were: First, Repatriate;
second, Kyra; third, King’s
Song ; fourth, Imposing. In
each of the four divisions the
favorite was defeated.
CommiUee members of
Tattersall’s Club expect a big
roll-up at Randwick on Satur-
day when its Centenary Cup
(worth £3500, an attractive
late - autumn mile and a
quarter) will highlight the
afternoon’s racing. Excellent
entries were received for the
minor events, though the two-
year-old races are light on.
Cup nominations include
Wagga Cup winner Flash Gem,
as well as other proved
middle - distance gallopers
Prince Dante, Lord Cynara,
Saltillo, Monte Carlo, Teran-
yan, Theodric, Lindberg and
Macdougall.

Goldist, at 40 to 1, was an
easy winner of the fillies division
of the Hawkesbury Two-year-
old Handicap, while the fancied
My Sambo had an eight-
lengths win in the colts-and-
geldings division. Goldist is by
Prince Goldsborough (imp.)
from Lindist, an interesting
name in her pedigree being
that of Signorinetta, a winner
of the English Derby and
Oaks. My Sambo, a first foal,
is by Berrylands (imp.) from
Dayann, family-lines including
Hall Mark and Nuffield.

Scotch Sun, easy winner of
Hawkesbury Second Maiden
Handicap, is owned and trained

to Palo Alto and French’s

Brimstone (imp.) gelding is
from the Enfield (imp.) mare
Gaetane, whose dam, Lance-

—and Melbourne
Racegoers at Flemington last
Saturday saw one of the best
performances put-up by a two-
year-old in Victoria this
season. Carrying 9.8, 201 b.
more than the second top-
weight, Sir Blink was badly
away from the barrier in the
first division of the mile Fern-
dale Handicap. At the half-
mile, he was a good 20 lengths
from the lead. Turning into
the straight he met a bad
check ; and yet he ran on so
stoutly that he won the race
going away.
• • • •
This is not the time of the
year to look for Derby colts,
but next spring Sir Blink
could be a match for the best
staying three-year-olds in the
land. He has the blood-lines
of a classic winner. He is
N.Z.-bred, being by Blue
Coral from Inky, and on his
maternal side is closely related
to the great Rising Fast. Sir
Blink has now won at his last
three starts at Flemington, and
in the spring he could find the
Derby distance there very much
to his liking.
•*• ' •
Second division of the Fern-
dale went to Sumner, having
only his third start in a race.
At his previous start, at Moonee
Valley, Sumner finished a long
way from the placegetters, but
in last week’s commentary this
page suggested that the huge
(17-hands) gelding wo.uld be
a different proposition on a
roomier track.
Like Sir Blink, Sumner is
N.Z.-bred. Appropriately, the
gelding gave N.Z. hoop Keith
Nuttall his first winning ride
in Victoria. Nuttall has
settled in Melbourne as first
rider for prolific owher W. R.
Kemball, who bought Sumner
for 1350gns. A galloper as big
as Sumner who shows ability
is liable to be right out of the
box.
• • • •
From now on, with the
Nationals in view, Melbourne
racegoers will take a keener
interest in the form of jumping
horses. The' V.R.C. last
Saturday put-on a hurdle and
a steeplechase. Winner of the
Barkly Hurdle was the aged
son of Gay Lad, Lord Celere,
who won the same race last
year.
It is remarkable how often a
horse wins the same race two
years in succession, but even
more remarkable is the fact that
Lord Celere had not won a race
in between his twin Barkly
successes. Last year Lord
Celere started equal favorite
in the Grand National Hurdle,
but failed badly.
The two-miles-and-half-a-
furlong Grassmere Steeple
went to Roadbourne, an aged
gelding by Ford Transport.
New to fencing, he has taken
kindly to the game, having won
twice from three steeple starts.
His good form is a change of
luck for owner A. Rizzetti, who
has paid high prices for horses
in the past but had not raced
a winner before he gave
800gns. for Roadbourne. That
gelding gets his jumping ability
from his dam, Boumeith, herself
a hurdle winner at Caulfield,
and a daughter of David,
greatest sire of jumpers the Vic-
torian turf has known.
Naturally Rizzetti is looking
to Roadbourne to be a National
prospect, but the distance might
trouble his horse. Dam of
Boumeith was Swan Song, a
half-sister to sprinters Manrico
and Studio.
On her recent racing three-
year-old filly Mineral Sands will
turn-out a really good-class
stayer. After a string of suc-
cesses on country tracks she
won a 13-furlong event at the
Valley last month in a common
canter ; and at Flemington on
Saturday she proved much too
good for the other three-year-
olds in the mile-and-adiaif
Terrace Handicap.
Interesting runner in the
Terrace Handicap was King
of Trumps, who won a maiden
event at Randwick last month.
Even Bill Williamson could not
restrain King of Trumps from
pulling hard in Saturday’s race.
The gelding ran well until the
straight entrance, and, if he
settles down better, should
pick-up a race against the class
about at present.
When a horse wins at 14 to 1
the race is usually a good
result for bookmakers, but not
many bagmen showed a pro-fit
over the success in the six-
furlongs Dover Handicap of
Seabeau. As much as 66 to 1
was bet against Seabeau, and
the bookmakers did some fran-
tic twiddling of the knobs as
money kept coming for the
three-year-old gelding.
Seabeau was one of the
smartest two-year-olds to race
in Melbourne in recent years.
He won his first three races so
easily that he was considered
a danger to the flying Sydney
youngster Todman. A rangy
colt, he outgrew his strength,
and his race-form became so
bad that it looked as if he
would be retired. He was
given a spell, and Saturday’s
success vindicated his trainer’s
judgment.
‘‘Bookie’s Dog”: The ex-
perience of Mildura (Vic.)
bookmaker Mel. Brown shows
how dependent racing is on
betting. For many years
Brown has fielded at meetings
held by the racing-club at Dar-
nick, a tiny township some 160
miles north-east of Mildura.
At most meetings he has been
the only bookie. The road from
Mildura to Darnick is so rough
that Brown told the club he
would not be qble to field at
any more'of its meetings.' The
club promptly put down an air-
strip so that Brown could fly
to the course.
“Bullaw'ay”: Moni Koura,
dam of brilliant filly Manzana,
is unable to produce enough
milk for her foals, whiqh have
to be reared on a foster-mother.
This has not affected their
ability on the race-track, as her
six foals to race are all winners.
The first one, Wonder Gold,
won over $ 11,000 in Malaya;
another, Golden Apple, has
won in Japan.
“P.0.M.C.”: According to
racing records generally, horses
carrying saddlecloth-numbers
6 and 7 win the least number of
races. For instance,, in the
Caulfield Cup since 1908 these
numbers have registered one
win each—No. 6 in 1910
(Flavinius) and No. 7 in 1938
(Buzalong). In the Melbourne
Cup since 1877,-No. 6 has
scored once —1878 (Calamia)
—while No. 7 hasn’t scored at
all. The average for No. 7 isn’t
much better week after week
at suburban meetings ; No. 6
bobs-up slightly more often.
This remarkable fact probably
explains why, in their eternal
search for winners, punters
are, in short, mostly at sixes-
and-sevens.

Trotting
The previous week’s deferred
trotting meeting was held at
Harold Park on Saturday
night before a crowd of 19,476.
Sibelia romped home a winner
from her old rival, Sky High,
in the Harold Park Free-for-
all. Sibelia is now to get a
well-earned spell.
Watts jumped Sibelia away
smartly at the start, and the
result was never in doubt. He
was leaning back in the sulky
trying to hold her back to the
field most of the way, even in
the straight, and won comfort-
ably by a length from Sky
High.
The three heats of the
£4OOO N.S.W. Pacers’ Derby
provided some thrilling racing.
New Zealander Tobacco Road
redeemed himself after his
narrow defeat by Perfect Lass
at Menangle the previous week.
Starting favorite at 5 to 2, he
went on to defeat Correlate by
If lengths.

Victorian gelding Wondrous
(9-to-4 favorite) impressively
won the second heat by half-
a-head from local colt Illawarra
Ayr (3 to 1), with Gay Baron
(3 to 1), a length away, third.
Wondrous ran the Ilf furlongs
in 3min. 9fsec., 2fsec. faster
than Tobacco Road in the first
heat and 2fsec. faster than
Perfect Lass in the third heat.
In the third heat Perfect
Lass won in good style by 11-

Stories of the Coastal Lights No. 17
Gabo Light
£2*35
Because of the part it plays in reporting the movement of
passing ships and ocean-going yachts, Gabo Island light is
one of the best-known in Australia. The island has an area
of 380 acres and is a third of a mile from Cape Howe on the
border between N.S W. and Victoria. The 154 ft. tower is
the second tallest on the Australian coast—only 4 ft. less than
the tower at Cape Wickham, King Island, in Bass Strait.
The first official move to build a lighthouse on Gabo
Island was made in 1845 and work on digging the foundations
began the following year. However, the cost of excavation
exceeded the contract price and work was halted in 1847.
The wreck near Gabo on May 15, 1853, of the Monumental
City —first steamer to cross the Pacific from America to
Australia —with the loss of 33 lives is believed to have
prompted a decision to erect a temporary fixed light at Gabo.
The precise date of opening is uncertain, but it was probably
first exhibited in November, 1853. It then had a range of
15 miles. As a fog signal, the lightkeepers were required to
strike .i gong every minute, day and night, during a fog.
Later, an explosive rocket fog signal was installed.
In 1862, the temporary wooden tower was replaced with a
permanent tower of red granite quarried on the island. This
light was strengthened in 1909 when an incandescent kerosene
mantle burner replaced the old wick lamp. In 1913, the
character of the light was changed from fixed to occulating,
and four years later it was converted to group flashing.
In 1935, the original lens which had been installed in 1862
was removed and an electrically-operated revolving lens in-
stalled. This new apparatus increased the strength of the
light to 927,000 candlepower, giving it a visibility of 19 miles
in clear weather. An auxiliary fixed red light in the tower
also has a range of 19 miles.
Three lightkeepers are stationed at Gabo Island.
Wrecks near Gabo since the light was firs' shown include
the Easby, 1489 tons, the Iron Prince, 1992 tons, the River in a,
4758 tons. The position of the light is latitude 37° 34' south,
longitude 149° 55' east.

Blackpool was not even disconcerted
when Australia had two No. 13’s
on at the end.
The 43-year-old “Mr. Soccer,”
Stanley Matthews, at outside-right,
was the centre of attraction, and
the crowd roared each time he had
the ball at his toes. Though with
sore feet and never appearing to
over-exert himself, he showed
enough of his magic and wizardry
to please anyone. He weaved right,
left and centre —a couple of times
he even took the ball through his
opponent's legs and kept posses-
sion. Blackpool's second goal,
headed-in ’ by the not-altogether-
ordinary-either outside-left, Perry,
came from a famous Matthews
centre. Inside-right, Jimmy Hagan,
was another star of the game.
Australia; as in recent years
against other classy overseas' clubs,
tried hard right to the end. Best
forwards were the two goalkickers,
Loughran and Morrow, while in
defence skipper centre-half Joe
Marston and goalkeeper McCabe,
from South Australia (who made
some splendid saves), did best.
On Sunday, at Wallsend, Black-
pool defeated N.S.W., 8-0, with
Stanley Matthews having to retire
injured in the first half.
Another Soccer result —the English
Cup-final, at Wembley, was won
2-0 by Bolton Wanderers from ill-
fated Manchester United.
“Rob”: Stanley (“The
Magician”) Matthews, aiso
known as “Mr. Soccer,” played
his first big league club-match
in 1931 for Stoke City. He
made his international debut
a bare three years later, and
since then has played in more
than 90 international and
representative games. Mat-
thews transferred from Stoke
City to Blackpool in 1947.
Many people seem to think
that Blackpool paid a king's
ransom for Matthews. Actually
they paid only £11,500—£3500
less, for instance, than they
paid for right-half Jimmy
Kelly. In 1948 Matthews was
voted Footballer of the Year.
Last year he received a C.8.E.,
and many think he’s earned a
knighthood.

Melbourne, as has so often
been the case in the past couple
of years, is now alone on
match-points at the top of the
V.F.L. ladder. On Saturday
the Demons just got there
against a determined Hawthorn
11.10-9.14, while Collingwood
and Richmond, which had
been level with Melbourne on
match-points, both went down.
Essendon maintained its hoo-
doo at home against ’Wood,
13.9-9.15, while Fitzroy Lions,
keeping Richmond Tigers’
redoubtable little men right
under control, chewed ’em up
properly, 16.17-8.8. St. Kilda
gave Carlton the blues, 12.21-
8.7; Footscray beat North,
7.12-6.4; and in its first win,
an exciting one-pointer, 8.12-
8.11, South allowed Geelong to
keep one distinction all to itself
—the Cats are the only team
yet to win.

“Rossby”: Sometimes it’s
quickly come and quickly go,
in the V.F.L. as elsewhere.
Take the case of full-forward
Max Cross, erstwhile of Foots-
cray. In 1956, in his first
V.F.L. year, he did so well
while deputising for injured
star full-forward Jack Collins
(top V.F.L. goalkicker in 1954
and 1957) that, when Collins
returned to the side, he was
shifted and Cross was left in
front of goal. Cross finished
1956 with 52 goals, second on
the V.F.L. list, four goals
behind, to another first-year
player, St. Kilda’s Bill Young,
and he looked to have a big
football future. But in 1957 he
faded-out, and spent most of
the year with the seconds ; and
this year ’Scray cleared him
without any hesitation to

probably the most interesting
in Australian boxing at
present. On April 18, at
West Melbourne, the

Italian Giordano Campari on.
a t.k.o. in the ninth round.
On March 28, also at West

with the highly rated Campari.
On April 26, at the same

thrashed another Italian,

on April 28, in Sydney, had a
close win over yet another
Italian, Letterio Petilli. Sands’s
next opponent, on May 28, is to
be Filipino Tommy Romulo,
who k.o.’d him a few months
back but who then was beaten
on points by Carlos.

James Dugan’s book, The Great

the Great Eastern was dismantled
in 1890, two skeletons were lound
in the ship's sneli. L. T. C. Rolt,

skeletons were found. Can anyone

correct version?
Information Supplied
From The Bulletin’s
Service Department (26/3/’5B)
erred when it said, that Athene was
the Greek goddess of the sea.
Pallas Athene (Roman Minerva)
was the goddess of wisdom who,
according to the myth, sprang fully-
aimed fiom the head of Zeus (or
Jupiter). She was destined to pre-
side over peace, defensive war and
needlework, and to be the inca* na-
tion of wisdom. The name
“Athene” is derived from a Sans-
krit word meaning “the light of
daybreak,” hence the idea of this
goddess being the impersonation of
the knowledge-giving spirit of the
sky.
lhere was no goddess of the
sea—not even a wife of the god
of the sea, Poseidon or Neptune,
who was said to love the earth
(Ceres), whom he embraces, as the
sea does the earth. Both in Latin
and Greek the word for “ship” is
feminine. In Virgil’s Aeneid names
are given to a number of the
ships of Aeneas —“Chimtera,”
"Scylla,” “Centaur,” “Pristis,”
“Tiger” and “Triton” —in keeping
with the figureheads.
There is a beautiful bronze figure-
head of Minerva, found near
Epirus, in Greece, in the British
Museum, and other goddesses, etc.,
may also have been used.
The feminine gender of ship in
Latin and Greek may have had
some part in the use of “she,” and
also the prevalence of women —1
believe —as figureheads in past days,
together with the various charac-
teristics imputed both to women
and to ships.

A search showed slaters, or wood-
lice, to be the culprits. 1 recom-
mend the following remedy:
Put a heaped teaspoon of Paris-
green into a breakfast-cup of plain
flour and mix well. Cut a very
small hole in the corner of a
paper-bag; trickle a fine stream of
the mixture round clumps of
plants or seed-boxes. Knocks ’em

Can you give me a formula jor

Boil 2oz. best hops in 4 quarts

half-pound brown sugar, beat-up
lib. flour in some of the liquid and
mix all well together. On the
third day add 31b. boiled and
mashed potatoes, letting the mix-
ture stand until next day. Strain,
and it’s ready for use; stir fre-
quently while making, and keep
near a fire. Before using stir well;
it will keep two or three months
in a cool place. This yeast packs
a punch; half the usual amount
necessary for baking is enough. It
can be kept in a temperature as
high as 104 5 F.

Can you tell tv? if, as I’ve read,
the bays extending up and down
the coastal plain from Virginia to
Georgia {U.S.A.) were caused by
a shower of comets ?
Hard to say definitely; there
are two schools of thought. Some
think the strange scars —the bays
of the Atlantic Coastal Plain —are
merely rather odd swamps. But a
good few believe a comet was the
cause—or, rather, a swarm of
comets of an estimated 40,000 tons
travelling at 144,000 miles per hour.
Some points for the defence: the
w'hole area is thought to have been
a vast ellipse, with its long axis
running north-west-south-east; in
the eastern part of this great oval
the craters made by the descending
meteors would long since have
been obliterated by the sea; in the
western hilly and mountainous
parts erosion would have done the
trick; but in the central belt across
the middle of the ellipse, where
erosion is very slow, it seems
reasonable to assume the crater-
bays would still exist in recognis-
able form. Also, all the bays are
beautifully oval in shape; they are
oriented in the same general direc-
tion; they are bordered by sand-
rims, highest and widest around
the south-eastern ends of the
depressions, which are composed
of the same kind of sand as that
lying under the black-peat soil
with which the depressions have
“This calls for a widerscope!”
been filled over the centuries.
Magnetometer-tests ate said to indi-
cate the presence of great masses
of deeply-buried metal just south-
east of certain bays.

The school attended by our

sample. It had nine brand-
new rooms when she was
enrolled. Before the first school-
year was out, township
authorities had to order con-
struction of an additional nine
rooms. Son Robin’s secondary-

About 200 years ago he estab-

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
DISENGAGEMENT
THERE were plenty of
arguments in favor of
“disengagement” in Europe
before George Kennan
delivered his. much-discussed
Reith lectures on the subject
over the 8.8. C., but these no
doubt gave fresh impetus to
popular feeling in favor of the
mutual withdrawal of opposing
forces in Europe and conceiv-
ably added a number of new
recruits to those favoring the
idea.
Among the many who dis-
agree with Kennan, however,
are Dean Acheson, who was
U.S.- Secretary of Stale from
1949-53, and who examines
Kennan's views and explains
his own in a lengthy article
in the current (April) issue of
the U.S. quarterly, “Foreign
Affairs.” .
“Disengagement,” Acheson
suggests, is by no means a new'
idea:
“Moods change as memories,
once fearful, become dimmed,
as new anxieties arise, and as
present exertions become in-
creasingly distasteful. The
bitter teachings of 1914-1918,
and the determination they
fired, had quite disappeared by
1938, to be replaced by ideas
of neutralism, withdrawal
from conflict, ‘America First ’
After these, in turn, were swept
away by the devastation of
mother world war and by a
display of world-leadership
entailing vast national effort,
another 20 years has ended by
bringing back the old yearn-
ings and errors under a new
name. ‘Disengagement,’ it is
called now ; but it is the same
futile —and lethal —attempt to
crawl back into the cocoon of
history. For us there is only
one disengagement possible—
the final one, the disengagement
from life, which is death.”
The Kennan View
Summarising Kennan’s views,
Acheson notes that they “are
not new to him (Kennan)”:
“They do not spring from a
fresh analysis of the current
situation. He has held and
expressed these views for at
least a decade. The effect
which they have had currently
makes us realise anew that the
reception given to the expres-
sion of ideas depends upon the
mood of the hearers. This
reception may have little to do
with the truth of the ideas
expressed ; it has a great deal
to do with their power. Mr.
Kennan has told people what
they want to hear, though not
because they want to hear it.
What is it that he has said?
“The ideas are almost as
vague as the style is seductive.
IN THE POT.
An Illingworth (London “Daily Mail") view of the British
taxpayer.
The thoughts are expressed
as musi n g s, -wonderings,
questionings, suggestions. But
what comes out of it is about
this:
“First, there is the idea of
disengagement in Europe. By
this is meant mutual withdrawal
of American, British and
Canadian, as well as Russian,
forces from somewhere. This
somewhere first appears to be
East and West Germany ; then
the ‘heart of Europe,’ again, the
Continent; and sometimes,
from the general ethos of the
discussion, it appears to be
all overseas areas.
“The second idea is the
neutralisation of Germany.
The third is that there should
be no nuclear weapons in
Europe. And the fourth is that
throughout Asia and Africa, in
what are called the uncom-
mitted areas,’ there is little to
be done.... except to relax’;
that ‘lt is perfectly natural that
Russia... .should have her
place and her voice there too’ ;
that ‘our generation in the West’
has no ‘obligation vis-a-vis the
underdeveloped parts of the
world,’ and, anyway, there is
no ‘absolute value attached to
rapid economic development.
Why all the urgency?’ If any
sound schemes for development
are presented, we should
support them, ‘when they arise’;
but only on the condition that
they tell us first ‘how you
propose to assure that if we give
you this aid it will not be inter-
preted among your people as
a sign of weakness and fear on
our part, or of a desire to
dominate you.’ If Asian and
African States should find in
this grudging, meagre and
humiliating policy no oppor-
tunity to push their economic
development within the non-
Communist system, and should
turn to Communist methods
and Communist help, we should
accept their action without
concern and with good nature.
“One sees at once,” Acheson
continues, “that these concep-
tions are the very opposite of
those which the West has been
following for the past 10 years
or more. It is an assertion that
the struggle naught availetn;
that it is dangerous, unwise
and unproductive. It is a
withdrawal from positive and
active leadership in the creation
of a workable system of States.
It is a conception, blended of
monasticism and the diplomacy
of earlier centuries, by which
the United States would artfully
manoeuvre its way between and
around forces without attempt-
ing to direct or control them.”
Disengagement Problems
Analysing these (Kennan's}
suggestions, Acheson then goes
on to consider the problems
which “promptly emerge”:
“First, let us consider the
idea that something called dis-
engagement can be brought
about by removing American,
British, Canadian and Russian
troops from some area in
Europe. What disengagement
does this bring about? Very
little, as one sees if one pauses
to consider the real it es.
“Compare the confrontation
which takes place between the
United States and the Soviet
Union in Germany with that
which occurs along the D.E.W.
line that system of early-
warning stations which stretches
from Alaska across the Arctic
regions and far out into the
Atlantic. Here there are daily
contacts on a thousand radar-
scopes, and doubtless the same
is true on the other side of the
screen. Some of these blips
on the radar are actual aircraft;
sometimes atmospheric condi-
tions produce them. But they
represent a contact which no
action in Germany can dis-
engage.
“There is confrontation in
every part of the world where
the area of the open and free-
world system may be reduced
by Soviet military, economic or
political penetration. No
action in Germany will produce
disengagement here. The word


Failti lit the
Future
• ;• •;>
This is the time of year when the world dwells
in love on the word Mother: on the faith it inspires;
on the gratitude it stirs in the hearts of us all.
What is its meaning—this word which is
construed in every language to convey all that is
honorable in origin? It goes in world-wide
acceptance: we speak of our mother country, our
mother tongue.
As a word alone it can be defined in any
dictionary; but in the mystical values it sheds upon
life, it is above definition. The story of motherhood
is so vast and embracing that no writing could
contain it.
Were a million histories to be written, they
would not encompass one small part of what
mothers have given to the world: given in a first
suffering to bear their children; given in sacrifice
to nourish and rear and educate them; given in
thirsts and hungers that rise not in the body but in
a spiritual striving for their family’s good; given
in the first prayers they have taught, and the Faith
they have left to surround and penetrate the lives
of their children after they themselves have passed
from mortal sight.
Joyful, sad, glorious—they all describe the role
of a Mother. She it is who stands silent to the faults
of those she has borne; understanding of their
weaknesses, proud of their strengths and
achievements. And she it is who is heart of the
home.
To have a good and devoted Mother is one of
the richest blessings given to Man. To lose her,
in the inevitable course to which time has been
set for us, is a deep sorrow. It is one which I have
had to bear lately.
This is the cycle of life; and the greatest tribute
we can pay to our Mothers is to live courageously,
mindful of everything they have given us, and
taught us, and left us in their noble example.
is a mere conception, which
confuses and does not represent
any reality.
“So, let us turn from it to
consider something more
capable of delineation. For
instance, exactly what is the
extent of the mutual with-
drawal about which we are
asked to negotiate? The
answer to this question does
not depend upon penetrating
the vagueness of Mr. Kennan’s
language. For there can be
little doubt, I believe, that,
once a withdrawal begins, it
will be complete, so far as
United States, British and
Canadian troops are con-
cerned. All the forces, foreign
and domestic, will combine to
bring this about.
“Complete Withdrawal”
“As the withdrawal makes
the military position weaker,
our forces will be less desired
wherever they may remain. If
withdrawal is represented as
advantageous for Germans, it
would seem equally advan-
tageous to Frenchmen. Ice-
landers, Moroccans, Saudi
Arabians and the rest would
quickly follow. And, once the
idea caught hold, Americans
would, of course, join in the
general demand. The ‘New
Statesman’ shows how the
matter is now being presented
to a small section of British
opinion and how it could
bemuse a still larger one" in
that country”:
“ Yet [says the “New States-
man’’] the missile agreement
is one of the most extra-
ordinary and complete
surrenders of sovereignty ever
to be made by one country for
the exclusive benefit of
another. For the missiles are
not intended to defend Britain;
on the contrary, they decisively
increase its vulnerability.
Their prime purpose is to
reduce the likelihood of a
Soviet 1.C.8.M. onslaught on
America during the crucial
three-year period which must
elapse before America
possesses 1.C.8.M.s herself.
The sole beneficiary will be
America.”
“We should not deceive
ourselves,” Acheson comments.
“After disengagement, we
would soon find ourselves dis-
cussing complete withdrawal
from all European areas and,
very possibly, from bases in
the Far East and Near East
as well. Indeed, Mr. Khrush-
chev has twice served warning,
once in Berlin in 1957 and
again in January of 1958, that
the sort of withdrawal which
he is talking about is with-
drawal from all overseas bases.
This would cut the striking-
power of the free world by at
least a half, and, perhaps, until
our [A mer i c a’s] missile-
programme accelerates, by
much more.
“This Vast Price”
“We must think of what we
purchase for this vast price.
What would Russian with-
drawal from Germany or the
heart of Europe amount to?
Is it possible to believe that
the Soviet Government, what-
ever it may say or whatever
agreement it may sign, would,
or could, contemplate with-
drawing its forces behind, say,
the River Bug, and keeping
them there? And, by forces,
I mean effective Russian
physical power, by whatever
name called.
“It is hard to see, after
events in Poland and Hungary,
whatever the Russian Govern-
ment may wish, how it could
possibly undertake so
hazardous a' course. For, if its
physical force were per-
manently removed from
Eastern Europe, who can
believe that even one of the
Communist regimes would
survive? Therefore, wherever
Soviet forces might b e
garrisoned, the expectation and
threat of their return must con-
tinue to be ever present (at
most it would require from 12
to 18 hours) if Russia is to
maintain the power which it
has insisted upon as recently
as the Hungarian uprising.
“At this point in our discus-
sion we must examine the con-
ception of the neutralisation of
Germany; and then bring
together the consequences of
withdrawal and neutralisation.
It is necessary, we are told, that
Germany should not be
allowed to be free to choose its
own course after unification.
It must accept limitations upon
its military forces and its
military alignment. In other
words its national life will be
conducted under far greater
limitations than those in which
other sovereign people live. The
possibility that any such situa-
tion could endure seems to me
quite fantastic.
“Whatever Germans might
initially think they would be
willing to do, there is no pre-
cedent in history for, nor does
there seem® to me to be any
possibility of, the successful
insulation of a large and vital
country situated, as Germany
is, between two power-systems
and with ambitions and pur-
poses of its own. Constant
strain would undermine the

sanctions of neutralisation.
The final result would be
determined by the relative
strength of the pressures from
the two sides.
“As 1 have already suggested,
the pressure would all be from
the Russian side. For there
would be no Power in Europe
capable of opposing Russian
will after the departure of the
United States from the Conti-
nent and the acceptance of a
broad missile-free area. Then,
it would not be long, I fear,
before there would be an
accommodation of some sort
or another betw e e n an
abandoned Germany and the
great Power to the East.
Under this accommodation, a
sort of new Ribbentrop-
Molotov agreement, the rest of
the free world would be faced
with what has twice been so
intolerable as to provoke
world war —the unification of
the European land-mass (this
time the Eurasian land-mass)
under a Power hostile to
national independence and
individual freedom.
“Good Propaganda?”
“So, as we think about the
matter, we must wonder
whether there is anything we
can purchase ‘one-half so
precious as the goods’ we sell.
We are told not to worry about
this ; that, even though it seems
quite unlikely that the Russians
“When Molotov said ‘No!’ we
knew what to say.”
would carry-out any with-
drawal, nevertheless it is good
propaganda to make the offer
and cause them to refuse it.
This seems to me profoundly
false.
“In the first place, it treats
international negotiations as
though all the figures on the
chessboard were made of wood
or ivory ; whereas, in fact, we
are dealing with living people,
subject to all the emotions of
mankind. If I were a European
and had to live through two or
three years of American
negotiations about withdraw-
ing from the Continent, I think
that, very early in the game I
would discount America’s
remaining and would prepare
to face a new situation.
Furthermore, to believe that
the Russians can be put in the
position of refusing to evacuate
Europe underrates their skill
in negotiation. They would
simply, as they have already
done, continue to raise the
price. And it would be we and
not they who would do the
refusing.
“When Stalin blockaded Berlin,
we knew what to do.”
“For those who believe that
Eastern Europe would welcome
American and Russian troop-
withdrawals as the beginning
of liberation, I suggest a quiet
sampling of candid Polish
opinion. I venture to predict
that what they would find is
a horror at being abandoned
by the West and left between
the Soviet Union and a
Germany similarly abandoned,
to which the offer of another
partition of Poland might be
irresistible.
“Finally, a thriving Western
Europe would continue its
irresistible pull upon East
Germany and Eastern Europe.
This would, in turn, have its
effect upon the demands of the
Russian people on their
Government. With a rise in the
standards of living in the

Soviet Union, and as some
broader participation in the
direction of affairs was made
essential by their very magni-
tude and complexity, the
Russian need for the forced
Communisation and iron
control of Eastern Europe
would diminish.
“Then negotiations looking
toward a united Germany,
under honorable and healing
conditions, and toward the
return of real national identity
to the countries of Eastern
Europe, while preserving also
the interests of the Russian
people in their own security
and welfare, could for the first
time be meaningful and show
the buds of hope. This has
been the goal of Western policy
for the past decade.
Asian Consequences
“Mr. Kennan’s discussion of
the uncommitted countries of
Asia and Africa seems to me
to disclose a complete lack of
understanding of the forces
which are at work there. In
the first place, he would like to
tell them, as Thoreau would
have done, that the whole
march of industrial civilisation
since the beginning of the nine-
teenth century has been a
mistake ; that they must be
patient about increasing their
standard of living; that they
must curb the mad rate at which
they reproduce ; that we have
no sense of guilt or obligation
to them because we are in a

development as our own w

any sound plans, we will con-
sider them on terms which they
cannot accept. This means
that we find nothing to our
interest in their industrialisa-
tion ; and that they are in
reality ward - heelers who
threaten one political side with
desertion to the other unless
they receive a handout or a
sinecure.
“Nothing,” comments
Acheson, “could be further

Union, that conditions shall

The conditions in these
countries vary from those which

stage to those which have begun

push it speedily forward.

power unless they respond to
the demands of those who will

altogether refuse, to expand the
standard of living in Russia.
“There are two ways in
which the Governments of the
undeveloped countries can bring
about conditions which their
peoples demand. Both of these
involve acquiring capital, but
under very different conditions.
One involves the adoption of
totalitarian authority, a
temporary depression of the
standard of living, forced
savings, and industrial equip
ment from Russia, paid for by
the export of raw materials.
“The other involves the
maintenance, and perhaps a
steady expansion, of the
standard of living, the main-
tenance of systems of govern-
ment in which there is a con-
siderable area of freedom, the
import of capital from Western
Europe and North America,
and the repayment of these
loans over a considerable period
of time by participation in the
expanding trade of an open
economic system.
“To say that economic
development has nothing
whatever to do with political
alignment is a fallacy of the
gravest sort. It is, of course,
true that economic aid cannot
force, cannot ensure, a political
alignment from any country.
But it is certain that, without
it, a different alignment will
take place.” .
Haves and Have-nots
“New York Times” editorial
comment on the U.N. report
that over $5500 million have
been contributed to the less-
privileged countries by
America (more than half of the
amount) and other major
donors, including Great Britain,
France, Australia, Canada and
the Netherlands:
“What is important is that
the free and relatively pros-
perous~States have assumed an
obligation to assist those that
are less fortunate on a scale
that could not previously have
been imagined. The idea of
investment in human welfare
has become a fixture in patterns
of world behavior when it
reaches sums such as these.
The extent of ‘aid’ is significant.
Several reasons have been
advanced for taking such a
course The most loudly
asserted is that it is necessary
to combat the Communist
menace by attacking hunger,
misery, disease and unhappi-
ness, because these can provide
the soil Communist
, propaganda thrives.
“More important by far is
that those who are sensitive to
human need and are able to
do something to meet it have
an obligation imposed by their
very well-being. Beyond that is
the realisation that all of us
will prosper as we make various
parts of our world community
more prosperous. Thus the
motives are a mixture of fear,
good morals and the desire for
gain.
“None of those motives is
wrong in itself and the corn-
binations may well be pro-
ductive. What is really im-
portant is that resources, both

"Colonialism"
It would be a very narrow
view which attributed the post-
war dismemberment of the
British Empire—variously des-
cribed as “strategic with-
drawal,” “retreat from respon-
sibility,” “the policy of'
scuttle,” etc., to either one of
Britain’s main political parties,
but it would be a fair observa-
tion that the Socialists have
been the most vocal in their
“anti-colonialism.”
Right-wing Conservatives—
such as the Suez Group —have,
of course, vigorously opposed
the relinquishment of Empire
and, at this stage of history, it
is interesting, if not ironical, to
hear the occasional Labor
voice more-or-less supporting
what the Right-wingers have
been saying for years.
Christopher Shawcross,
brother of Sir Hartley and
British Labor M.P. 1945-50,
is one of them and, as
“Yorkshire Post” notes, he
is now “ruefully aware of
Malaya begging Britain and
other Commonwealth countries
to share the burden of her war
against Communism, of
Ghanaians who called give us

Nigerians shouting‘Down with
Black Mans rule, of (as he
curtly and truthfully said) ‘the
Sudanese left by us to the
mercy of the Moscow-visiting
firebrand,’ and he asks if this
rot and renegation cannot be
stopped.”
“In country after country,”
the “Yorkshire Post” com-
ments, “it is realised (too late)
that propaganda about
imperialism was lying and mis-
chievous, that British over-
lordship was not an oppression
but a shield; and now that that
shield has been taken away
peoples of many nations lie at
the mercy of internal tyranny
and misrule or foreign infiltra-
tion.
“These calamities were pre-
dicted 10 or 12 years ago. With
courage and resolution they
could have been prevented.
Other countries, other peoples,
are on the list—Cyprus and
Kenya, Rhodesia, Somaliland,
British Honduras, to name a
handful. On behalf of those
that have gone an operation of
return and rescue is as much
beyond Britain’s competence
as it is beyond her desire.
Have we the will now to stand
and try to save those that have
not yet been abandoned to their
and our enemies? The retreat
has gone far and it is very
late.”
Various Voices
Peter Thorneycroft (former
Chancellor of the Exchequer):
“In the long-run the party
which will govern Britain will
be the party which has the
courage to face her with the
truth. And the truth is that we
can’t have more bombs, more
welfare, more schools and
more hospitals, only 1 per cent,
of the population changing
jobs, stable prices and a rising
standard of life all at the same
time. If we attempt it, we go
'on running into trouble.”
Prime Minister Macmillan:
“The free world cannot defend
itself by bombs and rockets
alone. If it were allowed to
fall into a world slump on
anything like the scale that we
knew 30 years ago, this would
lead to a danger almost as
great as military aggression—
that is the danger of large-scale
unemployment, poverty and
suffering. There coulo be no
better opportunity for Com-
munist subversion and
intrigue.”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
New States
There may be a majority in
favor of new States in N. S.
Wales and perhaps for a
central new State in Queens-
land (B. 2/4/’58); but, so far
as North Queensland is
concerned, the sugar-men—
by far the most important
section of its population—don’t
seem to want any change.
Three Governments on the
Queensland coast, with the
usual red-tape, might make
matters very awkward for the
sugar organisations. And there
are far too many civil servants
now, without adding to their
numbers.
The proposed new State of
Northland would have a
population of some 200,000.
About a quarter of its popula-
tion would be in Townsville,
which would almost certainly
be the capital; Northland’s
allocation from loan-funds
would be much the same as
any other Australian State with
a comparable population, and
taxation-powers may some day
be returned to the States. In
this case it would have to raise
the money to carry-on from
the people living within its
own borders. Wages and costs
are higher up there than in Bris-
bane, and this would be
reflected in the extra cost of
maintaining a Parliament.
It is obvious that-the same
political party would rarely
control all three proposed
States Northland, Capri-
cornia, and Queensland a
situation that would be inimical
to the sugar industry. The
desire to break Queensland into
three separate States is born
of the political hatreds and
jealqusies that go with elections,
and kept alive by a belief in
each political party favoring
the breakaway, that they would
be in control of the new States.
At present Brisbane gets the
most public money spent on it
because most of the population
lives there. A hundred years
hence the capitals of North-
land or Capricornia would be
pulling the trade and public
money of their own particular
State just as Brisbane is doing
today.—A. S. (Qld.).
King O’Malley
The work of King O’Malley,
picturesque Com m o nwealth
Minister who died in 1953 at
the reputed age of 99, has been
the subject of argument from
time to time. I had occasion
to address some questions to
him on the subject in 1946, and
his reply (in which, of course,
he addressed me as “Brother”)
was along these typically
O’ Malleyish lines:
I came to Australia for health
reasons and remained here. I cer-
tainly made some big contributions
to the financial and economical
progress of my adopted country —
organised Trans-Australian Railway
on credit. It is the only railway
in Australia paid for.
I called for designs all over the
world for the building of Canberra,
Commonwealth capital. I received
137. Instead of spending the
people’s money for rent to show
them, Lord Denman, Governor-
General, lent me the ballroom free
at Government House.
I appointed a Board of Selection,
which selected: 1, B. Griffin,
Chicago; 2, Sarine, Helsingfors,
Finland; 3, Pachu, Paris.
I paid two young Australians,
who worked hard over one year,
£4OO. I believe in encouraging
Australians.
In the first Commonwealth Par-
liament I moved for a People’s
Bank and continued for over 10
years, but no Labor man would
second. The Commonwealth Bank
was never before Parliament. The
late Hon. A. Deakin enabled me
to have the scheme printed as
a Government document, which got
on the fighting platform at the
Brisbane Labor Conference, 1908.
On October 5, 1911, the Caucus,
after an all-day fight, defeated the
Ministry and ordered the Com-
monwealth Bank to be created. Mr
Allen, the Under-Treasurer, told
me that Mr. Fisher asked him to
write a speech about a bank, but
old not say what kind of a bank,
1 told him a bank of issue, deposit,
exchange, reserve and rediscount.
Mr. Allen wrote the speech and

On March 12, 1913, my wife, at
Canberra, handed Lady Denman a
gold case containing the name of
the capital and she opened it and
christened the capital “Canberra ”
The Government of New South
Wales gave me half the Canberra
land free and I passed a bill that
the balance of the 593,000 acres
can never cost more than £4 per
acre.
The owners of the property
fronting Pitt Street and Martin
Place valued it for tax purposes at
£BOO,OOO. I added 10 per cent.,
making the total £BBO,OOO, and
secured it for the Government.
The then Prime Minister handled
the deal. . . .
My ancestors: They date back
from 190 a.d. and were so famous
in their time that they make me feel
an insignificant sparrow. In the
early days of Ireland they used to
fight each other, and when there
was no one else to kill they killed
each other. That is why there are
so few O’Malleys in Australia.
I have never kept a diary of my
people. They may be good, bad
or indifferent as far as I know.
I was never interested in them and
they were even less interested in
me.
Some of these facts are, no
doubt, open to debate, but
that’s the O’Malley story as
he wrote it to me.— Phil

Nevertheless, the claims of

They are, in short, doing a good

Walkabout and Wages
Why is there always an
implied sneer when speaking of
aborigines and their love of
walkabout? You can hear it on
all sides. “Oh, it’s no use
employing them; they only
want to go walkabout.”
We don’t, I suppose, when
we demand three weeks’ annual
leave on full pay, to take-off

Far better for the native to
follow the old customs and
bush-tracks on walkabout than
to hang about the outskirts of
towns, seeing trashy films or
haunting the back-entrances of
pubs.
It always beats me that with
all the yakkety-yak about the
general uselessness of “natives”
—I heard the same line of talk
in New Guinea —so many
whites are content to sit on
their, broad ends /ind employ
them. Natives are nc more use-
less than a lot of whites and
they don’t have a union to back
them in it, either.
That’s a very comfortable
theory of “Plain Australian'’
(B. 9/4/’5B) that too much
money isn’t , good for
aborigines, and that they “blue”
it on fripperies. You can tip
enough junk out of the average
Australian home, bought with
wasted money, to set-up a
solid second-hand business. The
only difference is that no one
tells us how to spend our
money.
With Government control, a
native doing the job of a white
man should receive award
wages—sufficient to keep his
family. This system of throwing
them a few bob and tucker can
never do anything for them but
keep them on myall-footing.
Talk of “fitting them into a
pattern” too often means a
pattern acceptable to the white
man, with no real attempt to
give the aborigines a dignified
footing in the community, or
any incentive to accept respon-
sibility.—Reveille (Q.)
Summit Talks
What change has occurred in
recent times to suggest that any
success could be achieved in
meeting the Russians at any
level? All the events of the
last 20 years have shown that
all and every means will be
availed of by the Communists
to reach their avowed ends.
Any agreement reached by
treaty would be all to the
advantage of Russia, because
only one side—our side
would adhere to such an agree-
ment, and thus we would lose
any position of advantage held,
Surely we have not forgotten
the “scrap of paper” excuse in
World War I, and the “peace
in our time” exultation of
Chamberlain on his return
from Germany in 1938? Only
a fool would deliberately place
himself at a disadvantage to
such an unscrupulous adversary
as Khrushchev by voluntarily
banning the H-bomb or any
other powerful weapon. As
none would seriously believe
that Britain or the U.S. would
use such a weapon as a means
of aggression, where is the
danger of its development?
The danger lies in not develop-
ing with all speed every superior
weapon at our disposal.—
E. S. G. (W.A.).
The A.C.T.
Now that the Federal Con-
stitution is to be reviewed io
clear-up points not settled in
the original Act, consideration
may be given to enlargement
of the Australian Capital
Territory to cover the whole
watershed of the Snowy
Mountains, right to the coast
on the eastern side, and to the
foothills from Albury through
Tumbarumba to Jervis Bay.
When the six colonies
voted in favor of Federation
Sir George Reid made a condi-
tion regarding the choice of a
capital-site exclusive to New
South Wales territory. The
other colonies agreed. In the
bargaining it was at last Con-
ceded that the capital-site
selected was to be of “an area
not less than 100 square-miles”
and that it was “not to be within
100 miles of Sydney.”
The battle had not started
for the selection of a site. Many
were submitted by local
advocates from all over N. S.
Wales. The highest-qualified
surveyor from N. S. Wales
chose what was called the
Dalgety area, inclusive of the
Monaro Plain, the Snowy
River and Twofold Bay.
Sydney did not want a new
safe harbor halfway to Mel-
bourne, with ever-flowing
rivers, and big mountains as a
background. It wanted the
whole of the boundary within
its State, so that it could
command communication over
road and rail and with no
access to a port. Later the
Commonwealth was ceded land
for a railway (but no road) to
a point 87 miles from Sydney
to high water at Jervis Bay.
Control of the water of the bay
remained with the State.
The Constitution Act pro-
vided that the capital territory
should not be less than 100
square-miles. This left the
whole of N. S. Wales as possible
Federal capital territory. It was
then explained that not less than
100 square-miles meant “as near
as possible” to 100 square-
miles.
Controversy and disputation
went on for years, the decision
being eventually made by a
majority of one in the Senate.
Thus was Canberra chosen.
It should be possible to
extend the area to cover the
portion described and thus
develop a static area of N. S.
Wales into a wonderful Aus-
tralian Capital Territory, in a
good climate, with fertile plains,
snowy mountains and a safe,
deep harbor. This territory
would be bounded on the north
and west by N. S. Wales and
on the south by Victoria.
All the sources of the rivers
flowing east and west would
come under the one authority,
thus eliminating all questions ot
riparian rights. Chas. C
Deland (S.A.).
Stamp-duty
In its search for extra
revenue, the Victorian Govern-
ment increased the stamp-duty
on cheques from 2d. to 3d.
Now the Comptroller of Stamps
has issued a ruling that all
inter-State cheques must bear
a Victorian 3d. duty-stamp
when paid into a Victorian
bank. This is said to apply
irrespective of whether the
cheque is payable to order or
to bearer—previously it was
understood to apply to order-
cheques only.
My bank informs me that the
Victorian authorities require a
duty-stamp to be affixed, even
when a cheque has already been
stamped in endorsing it so as
to constitute a valid receipt.
Thus in the case of a cheque
drawn on a Sydney bank and
paid into a Victorian bank,


stamp-duty may be payable
three times: by the drawer of
the cheque, who pays N.S.W.
stamp-duty ; by the Victorian
payee, in endorsing it in receipt
form ; and again by the Vic-
torian payee, by affixing the
stamp. So an inter-State
cheque for £2 2s. may attract
a total of 9d. in stamp-duty.
Add 6d. exchange and 4d.
postage paid in forwarding the
cheque, and the payment of
£2 2s. has involved incidental
charges of Is. 7d.!
For concerns dealing in large
amounts, such incidental
charges may be trifling, but
firms whose transactions mainly
involve small individual sums
are finding the extra cost con-
siderable — Doynest (Vic.).
One-class Trains
I travelled from Sydney to
Katoomba during the Easter
holidays in a half-etnpty first-
class carriage ; yet the second-
class ones were overcrowded.
This is not by any means an
isolated case.
Surely the time has come to
introduce one-class country
trains. I recall the outcry
against the proposal to have
one-class suburban trains when
it was made some 30 years ago ;
but the system has proved
eminently satisfactory.
The railways are losing
money by sticking to the two-
class system on country lines
A single class would mean
increased revenue —prospective
passengers are lost because of
overcrowding in the present
second-class carriages. The loss
of revenue from the slight
reduction in first-class fares
would be more than overtaken
in the all-round improvement
in passenger traffic. —W. P. T.
(N.S.W.).
New Guinea Natives
The Papua-New Guinea
Administration, in setting the
maximum workers’ compensa-
tion as £2350 for whites and
£634 10s. for natives, has the
ratio all wrong. On the basis
of what a native earns, it would
be nearer the mark to make the
ratio ten to one.
High payment to natives who
still don’t know the value of
big money goes back to the
middle ’thirties, when I was
acting Resident Magistrate at
Daru in the Fly River area.
The R.M. I relieved acciden-
tally found-out that our pearl-
ing-boys working at Thursday
Island were compulsorily
insured with Queensland
Government Insurance. When
some Papuan natives were
drowned during a hurricane
he put in a claim for £6O
compensation for married men
and £4O for single ones. To
his amazement Queensland
awarded the boys about £l5OO
each. The wise Native Affairs
people stepped in and put the
money into a trust-fund and
doled it out a little at a time.
They knew that if such
money were suddenly loosed in
a native village loafing would
be rife and health would be
impaired through white-fella
flour, biscuits and tea replac-
ing their own vitamin-rich
garden-produce. Later a native
named Barani, married and
with three children, was taken
by a shark and his widow got
£l5OO. I remember asking the
villagers, “Who will now look
after this woman and her
children?” The subsequent
roar of “I wills” nearly lifted
the roof off the district office.
In New Guinea’s communal
society widows are always
looked-after and so are mental
defectives and the maimed.
There is no need for high
compensation, which too easily
can corrupt untutored and
inexperienced minds. — Sanasi

The Musical English
Norman Lindsay’s quotation
from Pepys’s D i ar y (B
26 / 3 / ’5B) is a reminder that the
English of the past were great
music-lovers and -makers. The
paragraph quoted expresses the
diarist’s almost ecstatic reac-
tions to wind-music “that
which did please me beyond
anything in the whole world.”
This sentiment is entirely
in keeping with the character
of the man who was in the
habit of choosing his servants
according to their ability to take
part in the music of his house-
hold. Not that this was unusual
in Pepys’s time: indeed, from
Henry VIII’s days music
appears to have been a neces-
sary part of the lives of English
people. Kings and Queens
composed musical pieces good
enough to be performed for
more than four centuries after
their composers were dead.
Moreover, music was not
then merely a prerogative of
the highly-placed but was the
treasured possession of all
Classes. Pepys himself, in his
description of the flight of
London’s citizens before the
Great Fire, observed thaf
“hardly one lighter or boat in
three that had the goods of a
house in, but there was a pair
of virginals in it.”
In the reign of the first
Elizabeth music - study in
England was practically uni-
versal ; the middle and upper
classes considered it an essential
part of their children’s educa-
tion. Thomas Morley, the
composer, tells of a youth who,
invited out to dinner, was asked
by his hostess to read off a
part of a madrigal at sight.
When the young man’s attempts
at sight-singing proved to be
a failure, everybody present
wanted to know, “Where were
you brought-up?” Lower down
the social scale a similar pro-
ficiency was expected. Delonez,
in 1598, described how a man

Grandpa; I've got to go to bed.”
who pretended to be a shoe-
maker was bran d e d an
impostor because he was “un-
able to sing, sound the trumpet,
play upon the flute or reckon
up his tools in rhyme.”
In seeking jobs for the boys
of Bridewell and Christ’s
College, the City of London
authorities made it a rule to
advertise the lads’ musical
abilities. It was customary for
a young woman to be taught
“to play upon the virginals,
lute and cittern and to read
prick-song at sight.” Ben
Jonson relates that bass-viols
and viol-da-gambas were to be
found in every drawing-room,
while musical instruments hung
in all barber’s shops so that
customers might strike-up a
tune as they waited their turn
in the chair.
England in fact, boast
a longer continuous musical
history than any other Western
nation. The usual reckoning
is that the English school dates
back to John of Dunstable, 500
years ago, but Dr. Emil
Naumann (who never allows
English music more than its
due) believes it was inaugurated
“somewhat earlier than 1360.”
My personal opinion agrees
with that of those writers who
date the emergence of an
English national school of
music from the time of that
remarkable and original secular
canon, “Sumer is icumen in,”
which, written (and probably
composed) by John Fornsete in
1226, would make the school
more than 700 years old. Today
few would claim that
Anglo-Saxon race is as musical
as are, for instance, the
Germans.
If, as some think, a national
culture flourishes under
adversity (one could quote
examples),' then, one might
conclude, the English, riding
as they did for so long on the
crest of the wave, became too
much preoccupied with material
things and neglected the cultural
side. In that case we might
look for a further flowering
of England’s musical genius
now that she is no longer on
the crest.
Whatever may have been
the cause of the decline, the
fact remains that few today of
English birth or descent know
anything of their nation’s
important contribution to
music. No doubt millions of
English-speakers can discourse
intelligently concerning Beet-
hoven: how many hundreds, I
wonder, can name a major
work by Henry Purcell?
Why the English ceased to be
a great musical nation is as
much a mystery to me as the
reason why the Scots, Irish and
Welsh, with their wealth of
native (folk) music and the
genuine love of music found
among all classes and types of
Celts, have failed to produce
among them a single composer
of world stature. If Norway
can give us a Grieg ; Finland
a Sibelius; Czechoslovakia a
Dvorak and a Smetana ; why
is it that the Celtic races can’t
come forward with at least one
composer of renown? — Maitri
(N.S.W.).
Manners
Is one’s modern manliness
stressed by omitting to rise
when women enter a room or
to ask their permission to
smoke? We can look back dis-
passionately to our youth and
remember our resistance to
elders’ plans for our absorption
of politeness ; the young male
was particularly non-conform-
ing lest he become sissy,
smarmy or sucking-up.
However good the recollec-
tion of our youthful conviction
on this eventuality, we still
cannot remember a single
contemporary who acquired
with polite manners a despic-
able character of suave in-
sincerity.
Basically tho whole business
was by our elders a valiant and
valuable attempt to instil un-
selfishness and combat the
“Hang you, Jack, I’m all right”
credo in life, and it is regrettable
that parents don’t always stress
this point while steering widely
clear of any hint that children
lacking manners won’t ever be
gentlemen, get on in the world
or please rich Aunt Agatha.
The charming little par. by
“Applex” (B. 16/4/’5B) reminds
me that in “Thank you’s” the
females are deplorably lacking.
Never have I so longed to wield
a hairbrush on feminine sterns
as when I held a cafe door
open for four girls, in their
charming youth the essence of
grace, but in their thankless-
ness the epitome of bad
manners. — Sevenelms (Vic.).
“The Shifting Heart”
Val Vallis is not alone in his
opinions on this play (B.
16/4/’5B).
I have had close associations
with Italian migrants since the
war, having lived for 10 years in
North Queensland, where we
knew them as farmers, business-
men, fruit-shop proprietors,
cafe-owners, fishmongers and
cane-cutters. I left “The Shifting
Heart” convinced that Richard
Beynon’s migrant family was
not real, that the situations
were fanciful and the Aussie
intolerance not the kind that
exists. Momma is not the
dominant figure in an Italian
home ; sentimentality is seldom
paraded, though emotions are
always strong.
Many Australians do resent
migrants’ industry and success,
gossip about them, often keep
them out of their homes and
social-gatherings, and to these
the play has no doubt gone
home. But, after eight years
here, a 21-year-old Italian youth
who was not at all assimilated
would be hard to find let
alone one kicked to death.
I consider the play’s theme of
Australian intolerance quite
wrong, and the vulgar portrayal
of the Italian family not at all
likely to increase tolerant
understanding or friendly
relations with migrants.—

kind of farmer or
grazier are you? The
people who do research about
other people have found that
you and I can be put into one
of four fairly clearly-defined
groups. Once you learn what
these groups are, you can soon
pick where you belong, and,
what is perhaps more interest-
Speaking on the sub-
ject of modern methods
of transporting stock
from one country to
another, Dr. Ham-
mond, a world-
renowned animal-
research authority,
recently stated that
fertilised ewes’-eggs had
been sent from England
and transplanted to
ewes in South Africa,
using a female rabbit
as a transport medium.

method of sending
flocks overseas be-

ing, you’ll quickly have your
neighbors typed, too.
It all depends on how rapidly
you accept new ideas. Some
folk always seem to be first
with the latest. They’re called
the Innovators. You’ll find them
at every field-day; they pore
over the newspapers and
magazines and they badger the
Department of Agriculture in-
cessantly. Chances are they
own a farm welding-unit, and
maybe a power-tool kit. Their
properties are littered with
priceless junk: tins of drench
and dip, partly used and
discarded in favor of some-
thing fresh; new machinery,
waiting for the maker’s repre-
sentative to call again about the
defect ; gadgets tried and found
wanting.
In spite of all this dedicated
pioneering they stay cheerful
and their places are well run.
Their wives seek the company
of other Innovation Widows for
solace.
The Older Hands think
Innovators are slightly nuts.
They are treated with tolerance,
however, and even encouraged.
For, after all, they do give the
district something to talk about.
The second group are the
o_nes who befriend the Inno-
vators. They are willing to try-
out new ideas, too, but they
prefer to let someone else do
the testing. They enjoy watch-
ing Innovators. You’ll find
these valuable members of the
community among the larger
and more commercial farmers
in their areas. They lack the
air of mild panic that hangs
around an Innovator.
They are not blind to the
problems that need solving on
their properties. They want
labor-saving methods and
devices as much as any one.
But their affairs are too well
run to justify the risk involved
in trying something absolutely
new. In any district you’ll find
them the very first to try-out

ideas that someone else has
tested and found safe. In
America, where thousands of
people spend all day studying
other people, these farmers are
called Community Adoption
Leaders.
Next to them come Local
Adoption Leaders. These
farmers and graziers are often
quite tardy about adopting any-
thing new. They don’t need
to. They have been on their
places for —oh—years, and
probably their fathers before
them.
They are sound. So, when
they do accept a new idea, it
must be good. The news gets
around. They are asked to
explain it, and because they are
invariably on at least one com-
rnittee, they are asked to speak
on it. The news travels fast,
Most of us are in the last
group of all. We are Later
Adopters. We are the great
majority who mean to do some-
thing about it, but some-
how take a while to get
around to it. You see . . .
there’s the disturbance the thing
or the method will cause ; then
there’s the cost (which might
come down); and the business
of ordering it.
It takes us a while to hear
of it in the first place. We
work like the devil all day, and
that makes reading difficult
in the evenings.
A field-day has to be mighty
close and the weather right
before we’ll go. And if there
should be some job which ought
to be done that day the field-
day is out.

worry us much, and we don't
worry them. Occasionally we
find ourselves reading an
advertisement, but you can’t
really believe a man whose sole
job is to sell you something,
can you?
We’ll come round to these
new ideas in time ... When the
old implement wears-out, or
when the traditional -methods
we’ve grown used to aren’t
enough. But meanwhile, let the
Innovators amuse themselves
and let the Big Men, who can
afford these things, be the
pioneers.
So those are the four groups.
To which do you belong?
Whichever group we belong
to, we all go through the same
stages before we finally adopt
an idea. Here’s how the
research people have worked it
out:
First, we become aware of
the idea. We may dismiss it or
we may (next stage) show-
interest. Then we evaluate it
—weigh the merits of the idea
for our own set of conditions.
If we’re still in the race, our
next stage is to test it, usually
in a small way. Then (the last
stage), if we like it we adopt it.
Actually we are, each one of
us, under constant bombard-
ment of new ideas. Most of this
is by mass media—newspapers,
magazines, radio and circulars.
These agents ate effective in
making us aware of something
new at the beginning. But they
rarely prompt us enough to
adopt a practice on the farm.
We need more individual
prompting.
Friends and neighbors, sales-
men and commercial dealers
play a part here. Agricultural
advisory-services help, too,
though less than most officials
imagine.
The critical stage is the last
but one. Decisions are made
almost every time on the
success or' otherwise of the
private trial on the man’s own
place.
Acceptance depends, too, on
how simple or complex the idea
is. Simple ideas can win-
through on mass media alone.
Complicated or expensive ones
have a long hard row to hoe,
aided by the prompting of
friends, the urging of salesmen,
and the voice of Authority.
Another factor is Climate of
Opinion. “Joe says it doesn’t
work.” “Bill tried it and seven
of the beggars died.” “Cap't
be much good if they’ve got to
keep-on advertising it.” “It
works all right, but you’ll never
get your money back.”
That idea will catch-on
slowly, whether it deserves
such an unhealthy climate or
not.
Often no one knows how
Climate of Opinion is formed.
It may be favorable: “Fred’s
got one —it must be okay.”
“They cost the earth, but what's
the alternative?” “That sales-
man knew what he was talking
about all right.”
In communities where tradi-
tions die hard, new ideas will
take-on slowly. Where people
don’t meet often or get out-
side their own district, change
will be slow.
Young people hear more
about new ideas and are
readier to act on them. The
more education a person has,
the more likely he is to try
something new.
Ideas are the most precious
assets of any age. They spell
hope, interest and a solution
to our daily problems. Yet
our make-up is such that we
resent change. It's as old as
history.
In agriculture, it has been
said with conviction that if
every research-scientist stopped
research for a year, and went
into the field to meet the farmer
and grazier to explain the work-
done so far, we’d be five years
ahead in our ideas by the end
of the year.
The results of most scientific
work have to wait a year before
being published in an official
journal. These results may or
may not be spotted by radio
or the popular agricultural
press. If they are missed, the
job rests with the Departments
of Agriculture, whose allotted
function is chiefly extension.
The mass media come in some-
where along the line.
Delays occur in the
mechanical field, too. New
machines take six to 18 months
to reach Australia. Sometimes
release is withheld until stocks
of old models are sold. And
even when methods or machines
are publicised, the slow
mechanics of awareness,
interest, evaluation, trial and
adoption must go on.
Without doubt, our hope lies
in our sons, who are more
likely to know of what’s new
and to try it out. Let us hope
they are neither too hasty nor
too slow.
Somewhere between the
Innovator and me is the happy
man who makes this game pay.

White Panicum
“Myall”: “Magnoon- is
slightly off the beam when he
states that Siberian millet is
white panicum, and giant
setaria, as well as several other
names. The fodder-crop he
grows is white panicum, and he
has not exaggerated on its
growth and palatability. The
true Siberian millet is not grown
in Australia, but, somehow or
other, the name has been
attached to white panicum,
which, without doubt, is
another variety of millet —
probably Manchurian. If
“Magnoon” has any doubts,
the Queensland Department of
Agriculture will verify this
statement.
Giant setaria is not either
Siberian millet or white
panicum, but a late, tall-grow-
ing variety of what Queens-
landers call panicum, and
southerners know as Hungarian
millet. It is sometimes called
foxtail millet because of its
longish cylindrical head of seed.
Regarding the “few other
names” in 50 years in the seed-
trade I have never heard white
panicum called anything else,
until someone started using the
erroneous name of Siberian
millet.
Apropos the tricky germina-
tion of the seed of white
panicum. At times, especially
on the heavy black soils of the
Darling Downs, heavy rain just
after sowing will result in a
poor strike, as. the ground is
beaten down too hard for the
tender shoot to force its way
through. This might be over-
come by shallower sowing, as
the seed is rather-small, almost
half the size of Japanese. On
the lighter soils, little trouble
is experienced.
To get the best results, sow
101 b. to the acre as soon as
frost-danger is past, and the
plant will flourish throughout
the summer and autumn, until
the winter frosts' cut it down.
Cattle will clean-up the frosted
plants, practically eating them
to the ground.
Sleeping Cattle
“M.G.”: There has been
some discussion about the
sleeping habits of cattle. Own-
ing stud-cattle and caring for
them, frequently at night, I
noticed that in the open, and
on the alert for the approach
of unfriendly cattle, humans,
dogs and so on, they slept
lightly and for short periods.
However, when in a pro-
tected area, where they felt
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(24/4/’58)
Most of Queensland will probably get only light,
patchy rains during May, although moderate rain is indi-
cated on the north coast and part of the south coast.
However, general rains are likely in June, and these should
relieve the dry conditions in the south-west.
Patchy rains only likely in N.S.W. during May, although
moderate rain should occur on the southern tablelands,
south-west slopes and Riverina. General rains should occur
in June, with the heaviest falls in the southern divisions.
General rains likely in Victoria during May, with the
best falls in the east central, west coast and upper north-
east areas. Fairly heavy rains should occur in June and
July, with the likelihood of flooding.
Good rains should occur in a large part of South Aus-
tralia during May, although rainfall will probably be light
in the interior. The heaviest rains are indicated in the
Stirling Ranges and in the south east. Good general rains
should occur in June.
Moderate to good rains are indicated in the south-
west agricultural areas of Western Australia during May,
with the best rains on the central and south coast and
s.-w. central south. Apart from reasonably good rains
in the Kimberleys, the balance of the State will probably
get poor rainfall.

undisturbed sleep greatly
helped them to acquire and
maintain condition.

ing bull stretched on straw
bedding in his enclosure with-
out in any way disturbing him.
Drenching
“Billjim”: When drenching
sheep with phenothiazine, two
cardinal precautions should be
observed. Never let the
chemical contact the wool, and
guard against injury to the
mouth by the nozzle.
After drenching, sheep
should be led into a paddock
to prevent them slobbering on
other sheep in the race. Guns
which have cesophageal-tubes
attached (for the placing of the
drench in the gullet) have
proved very successful in
eliminating slobbering and the
staining of wool.
Damage to the lining at the
back of the sheep’s mouth can
lead to an infection which is
fatal in five days. Don’t ram
the nozzle hard against the
back of the mouth, and make
sure the end of the nozzle is
smooth.
When using a gun with the
oesophageal - tube attached,
make sure the tube is soft and
pliable and undamaged.
If, after drenching, animals
develop an' eye - condition
similar to “pink-eye,” they
should be placed in a shady
location and they’ll usually
recover.
Chances of animals contrac-
ting this eye-condition will be
minimised if the weather is
cloudy following drenching.
Rape
“M.”: For fattening sheep
and lambs, there’s no better
green-fodder than rape. It is
of easy culture, grows rapidly,
and is highly nutritious. Under
favorable conditions sheep may
be tumed-in on the crop 12
to 14 weeks after sowing, and
it will carry 10 head to the
acre.
Rape is specially valuable for
lambing-ewes, as it increases the
milk-yield at the time when
lambs are most in need of
nourishment. Sheep being
fattened for market may be
allowed to consume as much as
they are able, and they put-on
weight to, a remarkable degree.
Dairy-cows also milk well on
rape, but it should be fed
judiciously. The animals should
be turned-in on the crop
immediately after the morning
milking, allowed an hour’s
grazing, then driven out for
the rest of the day.
Pigs of four months and
over rapidly gain weight on
rape, and the flesh is firm and
of good flavor.
The land for rape should be
rich, and made friable by
ploughing and harrowing. Sow
about 41b. per acre in drills —
81b. if broadcast. If |lb. of
mustard is sown with the rape,
it will prevent hoven or bloat.
An excellent method is to
sow a cereal and rape together,
as this forms a more balanced
ration. About half-a-bushel of
cereal and 11b. of rape is suffi-
cient to sow an acre.
Sown in the autumn, the
plants will be ready for grazing
in the early winter, and will
give a large bulk of feed
through the spring and into
the summer, when pastures are
almost bare.
Showers for Pigs
“Ripview”: Everyone knows
that need plenty of water
to keep themselves cool during
hot weather, but no one had
done much about it when taking
pigs to market, until recently,
when the Americans fitted
sprinklers to their motor-
trucks. Truck-drivers can turn-
on the sprays when they think
the hogs need cooling-off.
This has paid-off well.
Experimental trailer-loads have
showed a saving of 2261 b. of
hog per trip when sprinklers
have been used. And there
have been no deaths in
sprinkled trucks.
Sugar-preserved
Cream
“Big Billy”: U.S. dairy-
research has uncovered a sugar-
preserved cream that will keep
well without refrigeration. It
keeps as well as sweetened
condensed or evaporated milk.
The manufacturing process is
simple for any well-equipped
dairy-plant. It produces a
sweetened cream-product con-
taining 40 per cent, butterfat,
additional nonfat milk-solids,
and sugar in sufficient con-
centration to preserve it at
room-temperature for at least
six months.
When used as the source of
milk-fat, ice-cream can he made
from it. It can be whipped,
used as a source of cream and
sugar in coffee, and in other
ways.
Only a cream-separator and
pasteurising and packaging
equipment is needed in pro-
cessing.
Rabbit Tastes
“Embassy”: What is one
bunny’s dislike is another
bunny’s < poison—as far as
food is concerned, at any rate.
Like humans, rabbits can be
fastidious about their diet. For
instance, it has been found that
not every rabbit likes his
thistle-root or chunk of carrot,
any more than every human
likes fruit-salad and cream.
In the past, the odd bunny
who didn’t like carrot has
enjoyed a longer life than his
many friends who couldn’t
resist this underground delicacy,
even when it had a bit of
arsenic or 1080 mixed with it.
However, science is catching-
up fast by providing a mixture
of foods such as oats and
thistle-roots with the carrots,
to give the necessary tempta-
tion to every rabbit with enough
incisors in his head to eat them.
Watermelon might tempt even
the most fastidious bunny.
Even so, the carrot is such a
favorite with Australia’s worst
underground movement that
the authorities are even con-
sidering growing crops on
contract to provide enough
bait for the continuous
campaign against rabbits.
Picking Apples
“B. I.”: Granny Smith apples
should not be picked before
mid-April in the Goulburn
Valley (Vic.), or late April in
southern Victorian orchards. If
picked too early these apples,
which will be stored until
August, will develop a disease
known as scald.
To reduce this risk place the
apples in oil-wraps and store
at 40° F. until the end of
May and thereafter at 30° F.
If it isn’t possible to change
the storage - temperature, a
temperature of 30° F.

Wheel-grips for
Tractors
“Billjim”: Wheel-grips on
tractors fitted with pneumatic
tyres are an important factor
in safety, particularly during
operations in hilly country.
While the safety angle is
dominant, it is advisable to fit
grips for other reasons. These
are saving of fuel by minimis-
ing wheel-slip, and the pro-
tection of the tyre from
excessive abrasion, also caused
by wheel-spin.
The gripping-lugs of all
wheel-attachments will have a
cutting effect on the ground.
On cultivated areas this is not
important, but it could be bad
on areas where it is necessary
to preserve an unbroken surface
because of possible erosion.
The variety of grips now
available enables owners to
provide better traction for their
machines in wet conditions or
on hills, but care is needed in
the selection of grips suitable
for particular machines and
conditions.
Principal requirements are:
they should stay fixed in the
position selected by the
operator; they should not be
cumbersome —the heaviest grip
isn’t always the best; they
should be easily and quickly
extended or retracted and
attached or detached this
applies more to the retractable
types than to extension- or
cage-wheels; they should be
strong and durable, and give
equal traction in both direc-
tions.
It is most important that
gripping-lugs be fixed firmly
and securely in the off position,
so that there will be no possible
clanger of their coming loose
while the tractor is travelling
from place to place or on roads.
Periodic inspection of bolts,
nuts, lugs and the moving parts
of retractable gripper-com-
ponents is a wise and necessary
precaution.
Barley
Barley-growing on
the Queensland Darling Downs
has developed to such an
extent that the Department of
Agriculture, in conjunction
with the Barley Marketing
Board and Northern Australian
Breweries, Ltd., are to conduct
experimental plots in two areas
during the coming season. Two
growers will be selected in
different districts, some 100
miles apart, and each will sow
four plots of eight acres, the
varieties on trial being Prior,
Chevalier, Research and Malt-
worthy.
Seed will come from southern
experiment-stations, the cost of
the trials being borne by the
Barley Board and the brewery.
The harvested grain will be
subject to malting-tests.
At present, Prior is the most-
favored variety, but Research
and Maltworthy are two new
varieties about which there have
been good reports.
Japanese buyers say the
Queensland grain suits their
requirements better than that
of other States, and present
indications are that surplus
barley can be sold at a good
price.
Under the circumstances, the
outlook for Queensland barley-
growers is quite bright, as the
crop yields very heavily, and
matures quicker than wheat.
Queensland Pest
“M.”: Foxtail grass—not
to be confused with fox-tail
millet —is causing farmers on
the Darling Downs (Q.) a
headache.
The pest first made its
appearance around Too-
woomba, and is gradually
spreading further afield, having
been found in small patches as
far west as Dalby, 50 miles
away. Here the town council
has taken steps for its im-
mediate destruction, before it
takes a hold.
The grass is not poisonous,
but its extremely low feeding-
value reduces dairy yields
wherever it gets a hold. It is
a low-growing grass, about 6in.
tall, with long roots and narrow,
stiff, leaves with razorlike
edges. The seed-head is like
a small bottle-brush, white m
color, and literally covers the
plant, almost hiding the foliage.
Foxtail grass is extremely
difficult to eradicate by digging,
as it forms a dense mat, but
sodium-chlorate or T.C.A.
sprayed at the rate of lib. per
gallon of water, plus a wetting-
agent, will destroy it.
Wheat Yields
“Mallee”: Competitors in the
1957 wheat-crop champion-
ships in the Vic. Mallee were
faced with their most crucial
dry-farming tests since the
inauguration of the competi-
tions, because of the unusually
dry conditions.
In the circumstances, the
final harvest of 33 million
bushels for the State was a
fine achievement.
A comparison of average
yields between the best five
years of the 1920'5, and the
best five years of the 1950’5,
showed an advance from 16
to more than 20 bushels an
acre, which reflects the im-
proved techniques of wheat-
production.
While much of the credit for
increased yields must go to
the plant-breeders, a big factor
has been the build-up in soil-
fertility through the use of
clover- and medic-pastures.


Women’s Letters
STONEY
“Never leave a party before the cham-
pagne!” was an adage impressed on this
Letter by that great-uncle of hers —the
one the family never mentions. Of course
these days one might stay all the week
awaiting the moment, but the Fourth
Birthday party of the Phillip - street
Theatre recalled the adage, for this social
reporter had to fly-off early to something
else and The Bulletin s man-about-
town, one Phillipe, put in his report,
which is hereby appended, as we used to
say in the civil service:
The best! Charles Dickens was there
disguised as Emlyn Williams, and so was
the beautiful Elvira, disguised as the
beautiful Betlina Welch. Saw Diana David-
son and the Harald Bowdens just around
the corner of Kevin Brennan, who denied
making the handsome, tiered birthday-cake.
Ruth Cracknell said she was leaving
Phillip-street’s current show, “Cross Sec-
tion,” because she was going to have a
baby, and that her place had been taken
by John Meillon, who after a week of
rehearsals had proposed to June Salter and
been accepted. So Mr. William Orr,
Phillip-street’s director, stood cnampagne
all round and called on Miss Salter and
Mr. Meillon to cut the birthday-cake.
Then Miss Salter kissed photographer John
Hearder for taking and making such
strikingly life-size and life-like photographs
of Mr. Meillon and herself, and a dramatic
critic who had wandered in complained that .
photographers got all the breaks, where-
upon Miss Salter very kindly kissed him,
too, and it is understood that, because of
possible future bias, he has been trans-
ferred to political rounds and will remain
there until kissed by Doc. Evatt.
However, champagne is obviously not
the only thing, for the party which the
British Drama League gave for Emlyn
Williams (disguised as himself) was some-
thing quite unique, and it was a sherry-
party. The setting was that stone build-
ing at the East Sydney Technical College
which was in early days the prison for
women. Now the bare stone walls rise
60ft. up to the open sky, the full-moon
sails around the lofty watch-tower and
you feel that you are in the last act of
“Tosca.” What a setting for a sherry-
party! Miss Evelyn Tildesley received
the guests, and Miss Beatrice was there
too. Mrs. Greville Maizels (a Sydneyite
who used to live in the same street in
Wales as Emlyn Williams), Miss Hyacinth
Simmonds, who knows all about pho-
netics (and so, no doubt, does E.W.), Mrs.
Sheila Nicholas (who was the one to say
it was like “Tosca”), Donovan Clarke
(who talks when he feels he has some-
thing to say), Miss Molly Cahill (who is
headmistress of Hornsby High), Edna
Todd (who comes from the A.8.C.),
Dick Parry, Ruth Shipley, Mrs. Harold
Abbott and many another interesting
person interested in drama and also in
Emlyn Williams. A delightful party.

shipping business in Bombay, is the son
of Mr. and Mrs. Norman Tattam, of

married at a Nuptial Mass, and the bride
was given away by Australian Trade
Commissioner Don Walker. Her parents
were thrilled to hear from her in Kash-
mir, where the honeymoon is being spent,
as they may not have an opportunity of
seeing her until after the 1960 Olympic
Games in Rome, which Ross and Maxine
plan to visit (they met at the Melbourne

What with the people who are inter-
ested in modern sculpture and those who
are interested in Malcolm Muggeridge,
there was a splendid attendance at the
opening of the “Small Sculpture for the
Home” exhibition at David Jones’
Gallery during the week. Mr. M. was
very amusing. He is apparently as
antagonistic to sculpture as he is to
culture, but he did concede that if we
must have sculpture it is preferable to
have it small and for the home rather
than large and for the street. The exhibi-
tion is most interesting, some beautiful
pieces, some odd and some puzzling.

Mrs. Ross Shelmerdine, of Toorak,
who is the mother of three small children,
heads a committee organising a big
carnival for children next Saturday
(May 10), at Como Parade, South Yarra.
Mrs. Shelmerdine, who is the younger
daughter of Mrs. S. Baillieu Myer and
the late Sidney Myer, became interested
in the Cancer Campaign when her mother
became chairman of the womens com-
mittee; the carnival proceeds will assist
that cause.
Cranlana, the Toorak home of Mrs.
Sidney Baillieu Myer, was the setting for
a gala dinner-dance, as a result of which
£lO,OOO will be given to the Cancer
Campaign. Through indisposition the
Governor was unable to be present, but
Lady Brooks was there, wearing a gown
of champagne-tinted satin. The garden
was floodlit, and in the reception-rooms
white and gold were used for the color-
scheme. Huge urns held lilies, roses,
gladioli and hydrangeas ; boys, dressed as
blackamoors, held candelabras. The
hostess wore a formal gown of white
French-organdie, with black Alen?on-lace
appliques on the bodice, and it was
swathed with watermelon-pink faille at
the waist. She was helped in receiving
guests by deputy-chairmen Mrs. Norman
Sheppard and Mrs. Maurice Nathan.
Those who attended included the chair-
man of the appeal (Mr. W. J. Kilpatrick)
and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth
Myer, Mr. and Mrs. Ross Shelmerdine,
Mr. and Mrs. W. K. Burnside, Mr. and
Mrs. Trevor Clarke (Dunkeld), Mr. and
and Mrs. Wesley Ince and Mrs. lan
McEachern.
First important function of the newly-
formed Junior Australian - American
Association was a supper-ball held in the
Royale Ballroom. An unusual featuie of
the decorations was a maypole, which
was set-up in the foyer, and from which
streamed ribbons of red, white and blue
held by amusing and colorful cardboard
figures. In the ballroom, where over
1000 people danced, rosettes and ribbon
streamers in red, white and blue decorated
the tables. The guest-of-honor, U.S.
Consul-General Graham Hall and Mrs.
Hall, were received by the four
vice-presidents: Peter Tremayne, Andrew
Gibbons, Jane Hennessy and Joy Allen.
Leis were sold during the evening by
members of the decorations committee:
Adrienne Paul, Beatrice Earle, Pat
Gregory and Lynn Vickers.

Sugar-plum fairies decorated the tables,
and large flower-faces were suspended at
the ends of the tables, when members
of the Genazzano Old Girls’ Association
held their annual ball, which attracted
700 dancers to the St. Kilda Palais.
Twenty-four debutantes wearing white
frocks and carrying posies of pink flowers
tied with white ribbon made their entry
through a backdrop of a fairy-castle to
make their bow to the president, of the
association, Mrs. R. J. Stanley. Guests
welcomed by Mrs. Stanley and her
husband included Rev. Fr. Gleeson
(rector of Newman College), Dr. and
Mrs. Leslie Smith (she is president of the
Loreto Old Girls’ Association), Mr. and
Mrs. Godfrey Stewart, Dr. Frank Hurley
and his fiancee Joan Lightfoot, Mr. and
Mrs. O. Canny and Helen Jorgensen.

The Oaklands Hunt Club celebrated
the 70th anniversary of its founding with
a supper-dance held in a huge red-and-
white striped marquee set-up in the
grounds of the club’s property, Sher-
wood, Green Vale. Wrought-iron horses
and gilded horseshoes, whips and caps
were used as decorations, and bales of
hay and straw contributed a rural
atmosphere. An old brewery-wagon,
piled high with hay, was used as an
orchestra-stand, and members of the
orchestra wore hunting-pink coats and
black velvet caps. The 400 guests were
greeted by the Master (Mr. Keith Camp-
bell) and his wifQ, and the Deputy Master
(Mr. Eric Rundle) and Mrs. Rundle.
Guests included the Master of the
Findon Harriers (Mr. Noel Mason) and
Mrs. Mason ; the Master of Melbourne
Hunt Club (Mr. Alec Creswick) and his
wife, and the Master of the Yarra Glen
and Lilydale Hunt Club (Mr. John Lith-
gow). Forty guests from the Murray
Valley Hunt Club, headed by the Master
of the Club (Mr. D. Martin) and Mrs.
Martin, were present, as also were Mr.
H. M. Deakin (Master of the Macquarie
Dale Hounds) and his wife, who had
come from Sydney to -take part in the
opening meet of the Oaklands Hunt Club
the next day.


now, won’t we, Kruger? Gawd,
ain’t he a dog-and-a-half! ”
Jack the overseer and the
others liked the name Henry
chose for the all-sation. At
Sulieman, Henry took the
strongest chain in the plant,
and, leading Kruger 500
yards down the creek-
bank, tied him up in a dense
thicket of gum-suckers. Though
three times during the night his
new master visited him with
food and comfort, Kruger was
unhappy in his solitude, bark-
ing throatily and howling
spasmodically until nine next
morning. But Henry remained
as happy as his friends had
ever seen him.
“He’s human,” he claimed.
“Crikey, he can almost talk. If
that dog was a man, I bet he
could be Prime Minister.”
A T nine-thirty, while the over-
■*"*- seer returned Mr. Hen-
nesy’s truck, the sedan rolled
into Sulieman Waterhole from
the direction of Dajarra. Bill
mentioned it to Jack on his
return.
“Three blokes get out and
announce they’re lookin’ for an
all-sation dog. They wouldn't
drink our tea, an’ they poked
about in circles and wandered
along the banks of the .creek
for a couple of hundred yards
each way. Sceptical coots. Un-
sociable. They growled and
grumbled about a ute, and
went away mumbling about
police.”
As the others rested in the
late afternoon, Henry saddled
the grey mare and whistled
Kruger.
“First real dog I ever had,”
he laughed jubilantly. “I reckon
he’s just what we need. If he
can draft up a couple of
hundred jolly rolled-oats into
about twenty mobs and shoo
’em off where they belong, by
crikey, it's goin’ to be a holi-
day for him, turning the wing
of a mob of wethers on the
road.”
Henry returned late and un-
saddled quietly. Kruger
gambolled clumsily about him,
but when cooking-scents drifted
across he left the stockman
abruptly and loped puppishly
in among the trio seated about
the gidyea-log fire. Jack roared
as a quartpot of tea flew under
an eager paw.
As they questioned him,
Henry filled an enamel plate
with food and wordlessly
applied himself to it. Later,
cross-legged in the firelight, he
unburdened himself. The trial
had been unsatisfactory. The
all-sation was strange in his
new surroundings, or perhaps
beef was the wrong tucker, or
more likely the sheep-man’s
whistles and signals were new
to him. He hadn’t worked any
sheep.
“Maybe he misses the goats,”
suggested Charlie, interested.
“The smell, or something.”
And later, “Y’ know, it’s a
German breed. You reckon
that makes any difference,
Henry?”
Henry thought not. He
thought there must be some
code of signals they would have
to discover, by process of
elimination.
But as the men rolled them-
selves into blankets by the dying
fire, he asked Jack quietly,
“You suppose they got a
German dictionary at Fasil
Deen’s?”
When the drovers moved off
at dawn with the sheep and
the eager Kelpies spread out
along the flanks of the slow-
moving flock, Kruger, slowed
by an ample breakfast, ambled
sluggishly behind Henry’s mare.
By 10 he had brightened, leav-
ing Henry to follow Jack the
overseer, but Jack drove him
off when the all-sation began
to make playful passes at his
horse’s swishing tail, and to nip
at the plodding hooves.
Eventually the big dog
galloped ahead to the wagon,
and at midday was discovered
riding on it, stonily masticating
a quarter of dressed mutton
which he had torn from a
fastened sugarbag.
As Henry and Charlie drank
tea from chipped mugs at
dinner-camp, they consulted
gravely. By some unspoken
agreement which had developed
during the morning, Charlie
had acquired a share of the
dog, a sort of moral responsi-
bility bolstered by Henry’s
requests for advice.
Trying to persuade Kruger to
work, Charlie himself ran at the
sheep, crying encouragingly to
the dog, which romped beside
him. These little rushes con-
tinued for some time, until all
four men were at it, but always
when they halted, willing the
all-sation to understand, the big
animal checked too, gazing up
expectantly with lolling tongue
dripping and heavy lips sagging
over long, yellowed fangs.
When the sheep were in the
break that night and the stock-
men had finished their meal,
Henry and Charlie squatted on
either side of the reclining
Kruger, feeding him scraps of
beef as they thoughtfully
weighed every aspect of the
business.
T>Y noon next day the two
men were as disconsolate
and puzzled as ever. They had
tried cutting off a tiny mob of
sheep as they travelled, especi-
ally for Kruger, but the all-
sation had merely flopped down
in the shade of a silver-box and
rested his head on extended
paws.
So when he swung into
action, Henry was quite
startled.
“Kruger! You little beauty!”
Henry stood in his stirrups
as the wonder-dog suddenly and
unaccountably darted forward.
But only one wether seemed
to appeal, a small one which
was cut smartly and keenly
from its fellows. Kruger
wheeled it around and chased it
rapidly back over their churned
tracks. A hundred yards off
he lunged and ripped at a
shoulder, bared teeth leaving
two wide furrows of white wool
half-a-yard long across the
ribs.
As suddenly as he had begun,
the all-sation withdrew, dis-
concerted by the strips of fleece
which clung to his mouth and
teeth. He rubbed his jaws on
extended forelegs to rid him-
self of pieces of wool as the
wounded wether shakily
regained its feet and scampered
back to be lost in the dusty
pack.
“Just hungry,” Jack the over-
seer suggested later.
German Alex had worked for
Tyson for 30 years. Living
alone in the corrugated-iron
shed just off the stock-route,
he was pleased to see Charlie
and Henry when they rode up,
but the visitors wasted little
time with pleasantries.
“Me and Charlie want you
to talk to this all-sation,” Henry
said. “In German.”
German Alex’s rusty memory
creaked as he rubbed the white
fuzz of down fringing his bald
head, while Henry outlined
their difficulties.
There was a short expectant
silence then as Alex hitched at
his thick flannel singlet and
his faded eyes met Kruger’s,
where the dog sat in the dust
before them.
Alex coughed. “ Guten he
said self-consciously, “ guten
tag. Er, guten-gute nacht.”
They watched the animal
intently. The all-sation gazed
for a long minute, head cocked,
then darted his snout nervously
around, to work busily at his
flank with bared teeth.
“Were you tellin’ him to
scratch himself, Alex?” asked
Henry.
He tried the incantation
himself: “Gut in dag!’’
Sternly. “What’s it mean
Alex?”
“Means ‘Good-day,’ Henry,”
the old man admitted. “Gute
nacht, ‘Goo’-night.’ ”
Henry’s face fell. “Gripes,”
he was contemptuous. “What
a cranky sort of thing to tell a
dog. How in hell would that
mean anything to him? Don't
you know any more?”
German Alex shuffled his
heavy boots awkwardly.
“Fell you blokes the truth,”
he admitted, “I can’t say as
I do.”
“Jove,” Charlie urged,
“come on. You been ‘German
Alex’ long enough.”
“Tell you blokes the truth,”
Alex repeated, “I’m not a
German at all. I’m a Pole.
It all seems the same out here
in the £iulf.”
The drovers were silent.
The old man added hope-
fully, “1 think I remember some
Polish, Henry, if that’s any
good.”
But Henry was slouching
dejectedly towards his horse.
“Gut in dag,” he. drawled
over his shoulder. “Crazy old
coot. How in blazes you expect
an all-sation to latch onto
that?’’
■OVEN when they sold Kruger
a fortnight later, Henry and
Charlie wouldn’t admit that he
was no good, never had been,
didn’t know a sheep from a
pork chop, nor that he really
was a hybridised imbecile
throwback to a mentally-
retarded mongrel Russian wolf.
The boss of a passing
droving-team, returning with
empty plant along the stock-
route, admired the huge dog,
and was able after discussion to
persuade them to part with
him.
Jack and Charlie and Bill
admired Henry’s demonstration
of a smart manoeuvre at which
it had been found the all-sation
excelled. Perhaps 600 sheep
comprised the little mob
which grazed quietly 50 yards
from the knot of travellers.
“Watch! ” Henry commanded
the prospective buyer ; then to
the dog, “Split ’em, Kruger!”
Barking loudly, the eager
hound bounded away, tearing
through the startled flock,
which parted magically on
either side, melting away before
the fury of the charge.
“See?” Henry boasted. “Split
’em neat as a cat’s whisker.”
But the drover was a hard-
bitten man, and when Kruger
loped back 10 minutes later
the price had fallen from £2O
to £4, and Henry and Charlie
had thrown in a strong chain.
(Continued on next page )


The new owners were travell-
ing light and fast, and might
be several days’ journey off
before requesting Kruger to do
anything but split ’em ...
On the same warm summer
afternoon Mr. Hennesy, driving
his utility on a bush-road near
MacKinlay, nearly 300 miles
away, was astonished when
a mounted policeman halted
him to enquire about
an Alsatian dog, and to
insist on looking under the
tarpaulin which covered the
tray of his truck.
IT was mid-January before
Henry’s kelpie bitch, Lil,
littered. Henry didn’t respond
when Jack the overseer, read-
ing from a Sunday paper,
pointed-out that the pups were
born under Zodiac Capricomus,
the Sign of the Goat. When
the bitch had weaned, the
stockman left the five mongrel-
Alsatians with the dark-eyed
children of a Chinese gardener
near Cloncurry.
“Even more goats in Cion-
curry,” he said, “than in
Dajarra.”
The Dodds, Jack and Henry,
had returned to Buckingham
Downs when Jonesy, looking
after Headingly cattle on agist-
ment, became their guest in
their quarters. The five were
enjoying a final smoke before
bed when Henry asked Jonesy
if he had ever seen an all-station
dog in Dajarra, and heard the
wonderful tales of his prowess
with goats.
“Yair,” Jonesy admitted
noncommittally,
“Was he really good?”
Henry pressed,
The other eyed him coldly,
“Good? Yair, good, all right.”
“Rounding ’em up, taking
’em home?”
Jonesy laughed rudely.
“Round ’em up! ” he roared.
“Gawd, man, they used to
keep the monster chained-up
always, until he’d broken every
chain in Fasil Deen’s. But he
used to tear his chains out by
the roots, and he’d go charging
out, slavering at the chops, and
he’d bog in and pizzle them
billies hell, west and crooked,
and tear around the town bay-
ing like a banshee, until the
goats were crazy with fright
and raced for the nearest
shelter they could find!”
Stretching lazily before turn-
ing towards his bunk, Henry
broke the long ensuing silence.
"Gute nacht,” he said softly ;
"gute nacht, you blokes.”
me with the most hilarious
adventure, and the most
perilous, which the Wain-
gongoro ever offered.
There still exists in the
family albums a photograph
of lan Wylds and myself, its
captors or at any rate its
successful claimants, holding
up this gigantic brute outside
my bedroom window when
we had got it home, lan with
his bandy legs, batlike ears
and grin of tough triumph,
and myself, always diminu-
tive, precisely the height of
the eei; and I remember, as
an outstanding example of the
vitality x of its tribe, that, when
we put it under the hose-tap
at the back of the wash-house
for some mysterious purpose
—probably to revive it and
preserve it as a pet —the beast,
which had been gaffed and
dragged to shore, severely
damaged with stones, hauled
across the countryside, hidden
under a bed and at last trium-
phantly bicycled home in a
sugar-bag, came dramatically
to life again and began to
weave its way in the stream
of the tap-water slowly
towards the shrubbery in the
back-garden.. It was eventually
boiled for the fowls, and kept
them happy for days.
I have told the story of its
capture, pretty well as it hap-
pened, in a short-story, so
cannot legitimately do more
than summarise it here: how,
eeling ourselves, we found
the boy Ewans, from the
neighboring farmhouse, stocky
and tow-haired, squatting like
some kind of water-haunting
gnome on the big stone over
the swimming-pool; how —he
spoke in his father’s Cornish
accent —he showed us the
“girt big yule” he was fishing
for; how we all three dangled
our worms before its huge
head, clearly visible in the
still water under the rock,
without its taking the slightest
interest; how a kindly trout-
fisherman came along in his
rubber gumboots, tried to
gaff the eel and disturbed it;
how we found it again for
him downstream a bit, just
before the rapid began, and
he gaffed it successfully this
time and dragged it ashore for
us; how, when we decided to
go home with our prize, after
duly admiring its magnificent
proportions, that kindly trout-
fisherman said sharply, “You
leave that eel alone!” and
we realised he meant to steal
it from us. . . .
And then how, when his
back was turned, we some-
how snatched it up and raced
across the river with it and
yelled defiance and insult from
the clifftop at that lean, dark,
nasty-moustached man and,
when he came pounding
and splashing after us
across the river with his
ugly great gaff ~ outstretched,
fled in terror to Ewans’s house
and hid quaking under the
bed with the bed-fluff and
the porcelain chamber-pot
while Mrs. Ewans rocked with
uncontrollable Rabelaisian
mirth —“Under the bed with
the po! ” —and Mr. Ewans,
that stolid man from Corn-
wall whose thick lip was
stained yellow with his pipe,
poured scorn upon our adver-
sary for chasing after “a dirty
great yule that only a Maori
would eat.”
It was only many years
afterwards that I realised that
there was perhaps some sub-
stance in the fisherman’s claim
that it was not so much the
looting of the eel as the cheek
we gave him from the clifftop
that had sent him so furiously
chasing us, even to the door
of the farmhouse; and if,
making this allowance, I still
think the hound was after our
eel —what a rage he must have
been in! —it does strike me
as a weakness in our case that
it was not our eel at all, if
priority in discovery was to
count, but belonged to Master
Ewans. Very likely, as small-
boy gangsters from the town,
we had cowed that rustic
youth out of his rightful claim
to it and were in our own way
quite as unscrupulous as the
fisherman. Anyhow, we got
that eel.
But these were indeed des-
perate doings. Never was the
seclusion of the picnic-pool,
shadowy and sparkling
between the cliff and the
willows, shattered with such
violence before or since. Even
Ewans’s bull, who sometimes
entertained us with his uproar
from his paddock below the
ford, knew better than to leap
the fence and burst into that
sacred retreat. No other
picnickers ever came there.
It was ours, inviolably. And
it is thoroughly in keeping
with the spirit of that happy
place that the supreme experi-
ence I enjoyed there should
be an event from our own
family-life: a small thing,
nothing, everything. It was
no more than the sight of my
uncle Maurice Fitz Gerald, one
sunny afternoon when we were
all picnicking there, coming
round the bend from up-
stream in his canvas waders,
with his rod in his hand and
his canvas bag on his back—
tall, straight-backed, Roman-
nosed, with a clipped, reddish
moustache; the very picture of
a fisherman —and, in the bag,
when he displayed his catch
to us, two beautiful .speckled
brown trout, wrapped in
fragrant green mint.
I do not recollect that in
all the years after that flash
of inspiration, when I must
instantly and with my whole
being have decided that trout-
fishing was the joy of life, I
ever caught anything very
impressive in the Wong.
There was the trout whose lair
I discovered in winter; there
was a small fish caught after
dusk one evening in singular
triumph because my father, a
sea-fisherman but not inter-
ested in trout, had made one
of his rare excursions to the
river to see me catch it; there
was a splendid three-pounder
caught on the Coachman when
it was rising in the late after-
noon in the rapid where
Maslins had their stone-
crusher ; what else I know not.
But I fished that stretch
from Ngaere to Chiselhurst
far more often than any other
water in Taranaki almost
every evening of the season
when I was working for the
Eltham “Argus”— not for its
trout but for its magic. To
this day I have only to crush
a sprig of mint in my hand
and the whole Waingongoro
comes bubbling and sparkling
into my mind and, the image
of the art of fishing, my Uncle
Maurice, with two speckled
trout in his bag, wades round
the bend to the picnic-pool.


" Salome" Again
It would be unwise to expect too
much from R. A. Walker’s claim in
Heinemann’s new edition of Wilde’s
Salome that it is the first ever to con-
tain all the drawings which, Beardsley
made for the play.
No doubt that is strictly correct and
may make the book important to
Beardsley connoisseurs ; but the general
effect is much the same as in earlier
editions. Artistically it is no vast
improvement that the curious “male
figure” of “Enter Herodias” —which
like all Beardsley’s male nudes looks
more like a hermaphrodite —now
appears without its figleaf, while such
pieces as the discarded cover-design of
smudgy peacock-feathers would really
better be left discarded. And though
one agrees with Walker that it is strange
that “John and Salome” was omitted
from the first edition, it seems likely
that “Salome and Settle” was left out
simply because it was not a success and
didn’t really seem to have anything
to do with Salome.
The effect of the total drawings, new
and old, is to stress how haphazardly
and inconsequentially Beardsley
illustrated it or refused to illus-
trate it drawing, for instance,
“The Stomach Dance” when Wilde had
so clearly stated that Salome did the
dance of the Seven Veils, and bringing
in so many inappropriate objects such
as the venetian-blinds, the pierrot, the
satyr and the Parisian fashion-note of
“The Black Cape.”
Wilde, of course, by continually for-
getting, for the sake of pretty images
in the style of the Song of Solomon,
that his play was set in Judaea
(Salome’s hands are “white butterflies”
and even John the Baptist is “white
as the snows upon the mountains”)
gave Beardsley a lead for ignoring
realism; but the artist strayed far
beyond the inconsistencies of the text.
As for Walker’s astonishing claim
(following Robert Ross) that the
Salome drawings were “the greatest
set of black-and-white drawings that the
art world had then seen,” that is
simply an ingenious way of avoiding
comparison with the infinitely greater
engravers and etchers who had pre-
ceded him. Beardsley had the slightest
of talents . . . but, of course, one that
was distinctive enough to go round the
world, influencing many of the Aus-
tralian black-and-white artists of the
early 1900’s, and one-that remains very
charming in its bold decoration and
touches of juvenile decadence.
As for “Salome” itself—this hand-
some edition is chiefly intended to dis-
play the illustrations—it remains, in its
new translation by R. A. Walker from
Wilde’s original French, much what it
always was: a pretty tinkle of language,
an effective outline-drawing of the
characters, with a touch of genuine
depravity at the end. On stage, despite
the embarrassment of a shy English
actress trying to do the dance of the
Seven Veils, it was surprisingly alive in
a humorous and nightmarish sort of
way when the Australian Frank Thring
put it on in London a few years ago.
A Freud Family Album
Martin Freud sticks pretty well to his
resolution not to bring in his father’s
psychoanalytical studies in Glory
Reflected; Sigmund Freud —Man and
Father (Angus and Robertson); not
that his old man encouraged mental
studies among his children —the best
story in the book is definite on that
point;—
There had been a discussion in the
family about cattle, when it became
clear to father that none of his
children knew the difference between
a bullock and a bull. “You must be
told these things,” father had
exclaimed; but, like the majority of
fathers, he had done nothing what-
ever about it.
When you consider how often
Freud’s name has been invoked by
advocates of complete frankness
among the young, that is indeed a dis-
closure. There is another unusual
picture of him when his two little sons
had rowed him across the Thumsee
Lake, in Bavaria, where they were
holidaying in 1901, and a group of men
and women stood across the roadway
to Reichenhall and began shouting
anti-Semitic abuse: —
Father, without the slightest
hesitation, jumped out of the boat
and . . . marched towards the hostile
crowd. When he saw me following
him, he commanded me in so angry a
voice to stay where I was that I
dared not disobey. My mild-
mannered father had never spoken to
me in anything but kindly tones.
This display of anger, as I thought it,
upset me more than all the abuse of
the strangers. Nevertheless, 1 took
an oar from the boat, swung it over
my shoulder and stood by, ready to
join any battle that might develop
... .They numbered about ten men,
and all were armed with sticks and
umbr ell a 5.... In the meantime,
father, swinging his stick, charged
the hostile crowd, which gave way
before him and promptly dispersed,
allowing him a free passage. This
was the last we saw of these
unpleasant strangers.
Another unusual picture shows
Freud, hiking with his son, suffering a
heat-stroke on a mountain road,
“leaning against a boulder near a low
bush”:—
His .face was a purple red, almost
violet... .He was able to point
towards my rucksack, and 1 guessed
that he was indicating the bottle
of Chianti.... Kneeling beside him
1 handed him the flask. With his
arms raised and bending backwards,
he drank deeply from the actual
bottle. Anxiously I studied his face
which, although still discolored,
remained as calm as it always was.
He had not for a moment lost his
self-control.
Nevertheless, and this was notable
in my father, he did for once
abandon a number of conventions
which he always strictly observed.
He drank from the actual bottle
instead of using the small flat
aluminium beaker he carried in his
waistcoat pocket. He removed his
tie and unbuttoned his collar. He did
not, however, go so far as to take
off his coat . . .
Freud was, in fact, a typical
Edwardian father. He was always well
dressed, we learn early in the piece,
because it was proper for a young
doctor to be impeccable. He used to
take the family for afternoon walks
across Vienna, walking very fast, telling
often-told jokes. His favorite dish at
the midday dinners was boiled beef.
He would work from eight in the morn-
ing until three the next morning. In
the middle ’nineties he had a telephone,
but hated it, because, Martin Freud
opines:—
He looked one straight in the
eye, and he could read one’s
thoughts. Then it was an absolute
impossibility to attempt to say any-
thing that was not precise truth. . . .
Father, aware of this power when
looking at a person, felt he had lost
it when looking at a dead telephone-
mouthpiece.
His son, who is modesty itself, claims
rather wittily a small part of Freud’s
special gift:—
I have not inherited any of my
father’s knowledge of the human
mind, but possibly a tiny scrap of
his faculty has come down to me as a
kind of consolation-prize. When
anybody looks into my eyes, I can
read what he thinks of me.
But if the main interest of this
book as it relates to Sigmund Freud
is in the normalcy which readers of his
books might not expect of a man of
genius and of a genius whose dis-
coveries and theories of the dark back-
ground of people’s thoughts and
emotions have startled the world, it has
its own appeal as an account of young
Martin Freud’s childhood and youth;
his holidays on the Tyrolean lakes, the
trip the family made in two horse-
drawn carriages (the coachman offering
as a present to the somewhat shocked
Sigmund bunches of grapes stolen
from vineyards on the way) to Lake


Garda; his mountain-climbing as a
young man, and the loss of his friend,
the son of a rich man whose secretary
had a little daughter:—
I can now boast that one day,
when I was on leave during the first
World War, I held an entirely
unclothed Hedy Lamarr in my arms.
She was then two years old.
There are lively accounts of young
Freud’s (he is now about seventy)
university-life, where he took part in
battles of Jewish students versus the
rest, and of his military service, as a
trainee in the Imperial artillery. Photo-
graphs show him as an artilleryman in
World War I (where he made some
impression as an advance-patrol and
was, he records with quiet pride, the
first to liberate Lublin); Austrian
lieutenant, in the uniform in which
he insisted on visiting the bier of Dol-
fuss, lying in somewhat deserted State ;
and as a private and potato-peeler in
the British pioneer corps in 1941 . . .
World War I took all his
father’s savings, but provided the
cases which so much added to his fame
as an alienist. World War II
threatened his life, old and sick from
the cancer of the palate that had
worried him since 1923. The last
chapters of this book show how little
security even a man of international
fame can rely upon in a world of
politics and war.
Here we see Martin Freud, as
manager of his father’s printing-
business. forced to stand by while
the newly-empowered Nazis rifled his
safe and ransacked his papers; his
sister Anna forced to go to Gestapo
headquarters, which she might never
have left, except for camp and gas-
chamber, only that she was able “to
produce a letter addressed to her by a
German member of the Psychoanalyti-
cal Association, it being recognised in
Germany as highly reputable”; his
father’s flat, in which the family had
lived for 47 years, “swarming with S.S.
men in smart uniforms,” and an S.S.
man pulling open a cupboard and
“dragging out piles of beautifully
laundered linen”:—
Without showing the slightest
fear, mother joined the fellow and in
highly indignant tones told him
precisely what she thought of his
shocking beha vi o r... .The S.S.
man, a big fellow, jumped back
from the cupboard and looked
terrified.
Though, of course, S.S. men couldn’t
be kept at arm’s-length in that manner
for long; it took the efforts of Marie
Bonaparte (Princess George of Greece)
and Freud’s English protagonist, Dr.
Ernest Jones, who flew to Vienna, to
get him out, thankful that the valuer
appointed by the Nazis for his collec-
tion of antiques was a secret admirer
who awarded him almost the maximum
money he could take with him. and
pleased that “the commissar whom the
Nazis had placed in the press with
instructions to destroy it went about his
work with surprising gentleness.”
And he had reason. His brother
Alexander, an expert on public trans-
port, was lucky, despoiled by Nazis, to
escape to Canada, but one of his sisters
died of starvation in a Jewish ghetto
and three others were “murdered, most
probably at Auschwitz.”
Reviewed Briefly
Cake Making in Pictures: Muriel
Downes (Odhams). No review-page
devoted to the fine old arts could fail to
notice this useful and beautiful volume
with its 350 “how-to-do-it” pictures,
after which there seems to be no excuse
whatever for not making a success of
everything from scones to Creme
Chantilly. An additional literary attrac-
tion is that the letterpress, as it is set-
out amongst the photographs, looks
like —and perhaps is—nothing less than
poetry: —
Roll dough or pat it out with a
floured hand on a floured board.
Cut the dough into rounds with
a floured pastry-cutter or cut into
rough triangles with a knife.
Place these on an ungreased
baking-sheet and brush with milk . . .

No Earthly Command: Arthur
Calder - Marshall (Hart - Davis).
Biography of Vice-Admiral Wadham
Woods, who left the Navy to become
a parson in London’s East End. It was
said that he had received “an inter-
posed message” during the Battle of
Jutland “telling him to serve God.”
Calder-Marshall, who investigated the
clergyman’s life to get the background
for a film, found that this story was
the invention of a newspaperwoman
named “Bee Kay,” without any foun-
dation in fact: which, to anyone who
knows the newspapers, is not surpris-
ing. In the course of exposing the
hoax, finding something supernatural
in every simple coincidence. Calder-
Marshall himself gets somewhat
unnecessarily mystical; and also very
wordy.
THE SEA.. . FRANCIS WEBB
Mile and mile and mile; but no one
would gather
That we are running from something;
peremptory hours
Examine, order, condemn; all the stars
patter together,
A heathen tongue, while our homesick
storytelling fires
Are Hellas mouthing, burning;
Little dangerous men attack without
warning;
We loot and kill, singing hopelessly in
the foreign morning.
And the guide from Gymnias—none of
us trusts him, but here
We kick anthills, villages tickling his
queasy city:
At fear’s uplifted finger, fear rapes fear.
Ghosts of an army, of a people, how
might we have pity?
Pity is none of our pain
As, dutifully, dully, we prod blaze for
bone.
Talents wink witlessly as we shamble on.
Bicker with our breath the dry salt leaves
of his promise,
Still he is a safety, a medal of the kill.
See, the sun’s withers, letting blood,
inform us
Of haunted villages past this giant hill.
—But new rioting overhead:
The little dangerous men? Let us double
up to our dead
As the tail of the serpent lashes back to
his battered head.
Chorus, tempest, O canting heavy cruse
of oil . . .
The sea! And this bay, a carved golden
gymnasium
With alarums of the coastal birds that
dip and wheel:
Famous, jockeying, muscular, the waves
come
Putting their silver weights
Of spray so vehemently. Genesis of
lights!
Odysseus begs and prays his passage
through the gates.
We call, we fall on our knees, and we
embrace.
But Zeus, but Zeus, it is lungs, a living,
a moving;
Epic of Hellas, ten thousand voices cry
peace.
Our Melos might enter, holy and dead
and loving.
To wash his blood from our hands.
We raise an altar of stones. Hear the
chanting winds
Cajole from the godly cliff-faces their
shower of tributary sands.
And our guide? stockstill, the half-smile,
the pale anger.
Something is lost to him, finding itself
at the breast.
But something makes obeisance with rings
for that thin finger,
A horse, a goblet, money. Something
may not rest:
Tatterdemalion, see,
Ten thousand ghosts flutter after him.
But we
Turn again to our mother, our revels.
The sea, the sea!

This is one of the many accidents, caused by bad roads,
that are helping to push up your cost of living. Every
day perishable foods are lost through unnecessary
accidents and delays to transports. Who pays for this
waste? You might think the farmer, the insurance
company or the truck owner, but in the long run it’s
you who pays every time you buy something over
a counter.
76% of all freight is carried by road. Faults in our
road system, which cause transport accidents and
delays, result in unnecessarily high transport costs. In
fact, it is estimated that the cost of freight is 6/- in
every £1 you spend on consumer goods. Experts say
that good roads would substantially reduce this freight
cost even by half. Based on last year’s retail sales
this would mean a saving to the community of nearly
£350,000,000 annually.
We need a blueprint for better roads - NOW!
Roadbuilding is vital to Australia’s economic growth. It
is a task of top and urgent priority that must be tackled
now. We have the engineers, the manpower and the
ingenuity to build good roads. What is urgently required
is an Australian National Roads Authority. Such an
authority could submit to the Federal Government a
constructive programme for the planning, financing,
building and the maintaining of Australia's roads.
Good roads don’t cost . . . they pay!
When you think of
better roads, think of
the big yellow machines
that help build them.
