HIS BOOKS
Pacifist Fiction
It is significant that no such books as
the two reviewed below are appearing
in the countries that lost territory in the
World War. In this sense works of the
kind are national menaces, and they
would be banned if our censors were
logical. They create an impression that
civilisation considers another war un-
thinkable, whereas members of the dis-
possessed races who refuse to think con-
stantly about another war are regarded
at home as traitors, while those who ex-
pose the horrors of the last war are per-
secuted—-for example, the author of “All
Quiet.” Of course, pacifist fiction, like
Anti-War Societies and Disarmament
Leagues, has no effect on those who are
clear-headed enough to understand that
war only seems senseless barbarism to
the national haves ; that the idea makes
a diametrically opposite appeal to the
have-nots —always has and always must.
Meanwhile dreams of a world at peace
offer inspiring themes to imaginative
writers. They touch the same chords,
cater for the same yearning after the un-
attainable, which are the essence of the
Christian ethic. It is impossible for all
of us to be consistent Christians. But
how delightful it is to dream or talk of
a Christianised world!
The World War as a Dream
No Poppies in Flanders, by George C.
Foster (Ivor Nicholson and Watson;
7s. 6d.), postulates that the World War
didn’t happen. When the story begins
in May, 1914, the father of the heroine
is being tried at the Old Bailey for shoot-
ing in a Bloomsbury teashop Vladimir
Uljanoff and Leiba Bronstein, Russians,
and Gavrilo Princip, a Servian. He can’t
explain why he did it, and he is sent to
Dartmoor as a criminal lunatic. Both
father and heroine are Scottish and fey.
Jennifer, the daughter, marries Bill, and
they go to Belgium for the honeymoon
towards the end of August. At Mons
near a canal she falls into a doze.
The country which before seemed so
empty now was very full, although she
could actually see no one and sensed with
but an inward vision the presence of many
men... .Vaguely her mind told her that she
was in the midst of a crowd, and that
there was a horrid rumbling which meant
danger.
She is at Landrecies a few days later.
Even as she walked by Bill’s side in
peaceful happiness her imagination stirred
again. This town, with all sorts of little
side-streets creeping tortuously into the
central square, was all at once no longer
sleepy and peaceful. It was as though the
little side streets were all full of hostile
and armed men advancing through the
night. There was a vision of people locked
in conflict and the flare of burning
buildings.
Throughout the war years she sees
these dim fragmentary pictures of what
might have happened, and they go on
after the war. Trouble in the Balkans is
ended by the transference of “generous
additions of Bosnian and Herzegovinian
territory” to Servia. The Czar dies, the
Czarina devotes herself to religion and
her son, and the Grand Duke Cyril, as
Regent, gives Russia “something in the
nature of representative government.”
Germany gets territory on the Baltic and
no Corridor question intrudes, Poland
being satisfied to become a kingdom
under the Czar with access to Russian
ports. Germany is allowed to buy Portu-
gal’s colonies, and the British Empire
remains intact. In short, diplomacy
accomplishes what it never has before.
It satisfies everybody.
Jennifer and her husband are in
Vienna in the present year of grace when
a house-painter at work opposite their
hotel falls off his stand and is killed.
The small black moustache, dark against
his pallor,; reminded her, even in that
moment, of Charlie Chaplin. It was a
strong, good face, and she had an idea that
in another environment he might have gone
far....,
The man’s name, she hears, is Adolf
Hitler. It conveys nothing.
The obvious fallacy is that individuals
and not conditions cause wars and re-
volutions. Similar
rea s o ning has
caused Christians
to kill pagans,
and one another,
in millions (and
vice versa) on
behalf of religion. Martyrdoms have
stopped because religion isn’t taken as
seriously as it used to be: property, on
the other hand, is taken more seriously
than ever.
A Dream of World Peace
Gay Hunter, by J. Leslie Mitchell
(Heinemann; 7s. 6d.), reveals a world
which is at peace because property values
have disappeared. Gay Hunter, the
heroine, is projected into a future so dis-
tant that the very stars have changed.
Science and the war spirit have produced
the inevitable results; an over-compli-
cated civilisation, enslaved by its own
machines, has wiped itself out. The
earth is inhabited again by wild animals
and naked hunters. Humanity had gone
from bad to worse in the closing stages
of the civilised era.
The dreams of the great heroes, Akhnaton
and the Christ, Spartacus and Buddha, those
who had believed iri the triumph of the
kindly and the free, those whom men had
taken as beacon-lights for two long n%il-
lenia....had sunk into pits of slime, de-
voured and befouled in a more cruel
aberration of the human spirit than the
blood-sacrificing Aztecs ever knew.
The chief aim and only religion of the
descendants of the few who survived the
final holocaust is to live simply and shun
militarism and nationalism. Into this
paradise come an English society woman
and a Fascist, major exuding class- and
race-consciousness; determined to “put
these dirty people to work and establish
a colony.” They form their plans amid
the fantastic ruins of London. The
heroine realises that only one course is
open to her.
Massacre. There was nothing else could
wipe clean that sore. The Folk must kill
Houghton and Lady Jane and all of the
hunters, men, women and children, who had
gone with them, smash in whatever of the
great buildings and machines were smash-
able, and march out of London, setting on
it a taboo for anyone ever to go near the
place again.
How like the sentiments of many Ger-
mans with regard to Londoners and
London, and of many Britons with regard
to Berliners and Berlin 17 or 18 years
ago!
This is a beautiful story written with
great gusto and imaginative power. The
author is clearly an idealist, and probably
young. He hates strife, cruelty, injustice
and all the other evils which are asso-
ciated with self-aggrandisement, personal,
nationalistic or Imperialistic. Hates them
so much, as practised by humans on
humans, that he considers nothing too
bad for those who are guilty of them.
But his reformed Folk practise strife,
cruelty and injustice on deer, hares and
other defenceless animals, and he sees
no harm in that. The Folk must do it
it they are to live in the dietetic state
to which they have been accustomed.
The Folk are obliged to arm themselves
because without arms they would not
only have to forego their luxuries, but
would be in danger from enemies. Mor-
ally, they are less pacifist than thousands
of present-day vegetarians. Advocates
of disarmament are always confronted
by this impasse. Human beings can’t live
in comfort if they disarm completely,
and so long as anybody is armed he is
in danger of being out-armed by an ill-
disposed neighbor.

Some Australian Dramatists
Eight Plays by A ustralians may be got
from the Dramatists’ Club, Melbourne.
The problem presented for solution in
Doris Hayball’s “The Grotesque” is the
overcompensation of a hunchback’s sense
of inferiority. He appears “like an
obscene orang-utan” against a black
background, and children, lovers, beggars
and a priest pass behind him while he
soliloquises. The dramatist here remains
consistently in the realm of ideas. She
is presenting her understanding of an
emotional state in poetic form.
Most of her colleagues, however, don’t
seem to have made up their minds
whether they are in the realm of ideas

or that of concrete reality. In “Travail,”
for instance, Marjorie McLeod appears
to have been inspired by the visit of Amy
Johnson to discuss the following propo-
sition: an Australian aviatrix who has
flown round the world is in love with a
man who in turn falls in love with her
adopted daughter. , In a spirit of self-
sacrifice she decides to eliminate herself
oy flying to China via the Himalayas—
incidentally, rather a long way round. To
make this situation more plausible the
playwright has introduced a dialogue be-
tween the God of Love and a fairy, whp
is subsequently reincarnated in the self-
sacrificing aviatrix. One is left with the
eeling that an ounce of observation
would have been more convincing than
a ton of second-hand Barrie. There is
™° re .. Barne in Dymphna Cusack’s
shallow Cups, in which a woman’s
corpse is laid out for burial and a Dark
Man .with a candle comes in and gives
the relatives the opportunity for bring-
ing hei back to life, an opportunity of
which, for various reasons, they fail to
avail themselves.
Besides the previously mentioned Miss
Hayball, the only dramatist who appears
to traffic at all deeply in ideas -is George
Duke Walton, whose “Love Song”
paints a convincing enough picture of a
woman who has lost her husband and
son 15 years previously. The shock has
produced a neurosis which expresses
itself in the clinging to an illusion that
they are still alive. Here is an excel-
lent idea, but Mr. Walton, unfortunately,
leaves the impression that his heroine’s
mlantifism has such valuable lessons for
another character who is bolting from
hei husband that it impels her to return
to him.
D remaining plays John Ormiston
Reid s Van Diemen’s Land” is a rous-
ing melodrama of Tasmania’s convict
days ; “The Queen’s Maries,” by Phyllis
Dorrington Tweedie, is an ineffectual
attempt to re-create an episode in the life
of the Queen of Scots; “On the Edge
oi the Future” is an endeavor by Lloyd
Ross to show that the Spanish priesthood
opposed the attempt to discover new ter-
ritory in the physical sense as resolutely
as they opposed discoveries in the region
’ anc * Orake-Brockman’s
Ihe Man from the Bush” is a modern
satire designed to show that people’s
principles are seldom what they annear
to be.
A varied assortment, but nothing in it
to indicate that the Australian dramatist
has any very clear notion of the nature
of his job. There is nothing to prevent
his improving the quality of his ideas.
But his ideas will depend for their quality
°? vt S now^et^Be °f hfe ; and knowledge
ol fife comes from experience of it, not
from reading about it or attending uni-
versity extension lectures by professors
of Elizabethan literature or swotting up
the works of Barrie and Shaw in order
to learn new devices for writing plays.
Nor can an experience of life be put to
artistic purpose witho'ut an understand-
ing of what the experience was. A cow
has an experience when she looks at green
grass, and she puts it to very valuable use ;
but she doesn’t make out of it a work
°f art - The understanding of the experi-
ence varies all the way up the scale to
a landscape by Corot or Constable, who
knew how to relate the green of the
grass to the blue of the sky. This all
seems very elementary, but I make no
apology for stating it, because if there is
one thing which seems conspicuous by
its absence in Eight Australian Plays it
is knowledge of life. However, Austra-
lian painters and novel-writers have
shown a considerable knowledge of life

The Professors Hold Forth
Nation/xl Economic Planning (Angus
and Robertson ; 55.) consists of papers
read and brief reports of debates thereon
at the Summer School of the Australian
Institute of Political Science held at Can-
berra last January. That the book was
considered worth publishing is an index
to the importance which university pun-
dits attach to their lightest observations.
Unly two of the seven economists who
read papers purported to present a pro-
gramme of planning for Australia; the
others played with the idea.
Prof. Giblin’s scheme is to limit the
subsidy on any industry, whether by
tariff protection or straight-out monetary
assistance, to 20 p.c. on world price, sub-
sidies to be paid out of surpluses of price
ovei essential costs in unsubsidised indus-
tries. Assisted industries must submit to
control of prices and volume of produc-
mon: hopeless industries and
P-acti aoners of industry are to be
squeezed out and translated to subsist-
ence xarms, where they will have “the
barest opportunity to scratch a living;
bark or slab huts, potato diet and all the
other discomforts of the struggling
settler.” A “good proportion” of this
subsistence farming will be necessary.
Prof. Giblin thinks, “in the debilitated
condition of international trade which
we may expect for the next 30 years.”
Lloyd Ross, who followed, said un-
kindly that his learned friend believed
neither in Capitalism nor Socialism, and
probably would find himself in the next
decade having to choose between Fas-
cism and Communism or retiring to his
subsistence farm. Mr. Ross holds that
the only sort of economic planning worth
considering is Socialist planning, with
the nationalisation of banking and of all
main industries as the first step.
Save for a shadowy suggestion by
Prof. Shann (an aside in a report on the
World Economic Conference) that bor-
rowing by Australia for governmental
purposes would have to cease, and for
Mr. Macmahon Ball’s suggestion that
this country should set up a Supreme
Economic Council, that was the total
practical production of the session. The
chap who dubbed pol. econ. a “dismal
science” got the adjective right, at all
events.

Heraldry
“Kennel Club”: '‘Noblesse Disoblige”
(B. 25 /7 / ’34) disposes of heraldry—a
big subject—in one short article, which
is more notable for inverted snobbery
than logic. Heraldry is first and last a
stud record, and a glance at any stud-
book will dispose of arguments in favor
of millions of ancestors for the pedigreed
individual.
It is true that “no one knows who his
forebears were in the thirteenth century”
—mainly because heraldry, as an exact
record, is a product of the sixteenth cen-
tury. But the ancestors certainly did not
number 1,073,741,824, for lack of popu-
lation in mediaeval Europe. Furthermore,
at all times the number of English
families entitled to “bear arms” has been
small, and until recently it was unusual
for these people to marry outside their
class. In other words, inbreeding took
place, all gentry being in some degree
related to other gentry. This argument
does not ignore the forebears in the
female line, though with few exceptions
Europe has practised a system of
patriarchy.
“Aerogenes”: “Noblesse Disoblige”
has forgotten that inbreeding reduces the
number of ancestors needed. A list of
great-grandparents numbering, say, eight
may be reduced to four by the marriage
of first cousins.
History points to many cases where a
few people have become isolated, have
bred amongst themselves and have built
up strong tribes or clans without intro-
ducing outside blood.
The aim of many families, who were
keenly conscious of their lineage, was to
keep the line pure by allowing no
marriages with people of other families.
This system has shown an interesting
array of results. In early times the
struggle for existence was fierce, and
weaklings were killed or died out. The
strong became rich and monopolised
education, comfort and power, thus
building up the ruling classes of the
last few centuries.
Why have these aristocrats become the
mock of other classes? Why has pride
of ancestry fallen into something like
disrepute?
Improvement in transport was largely
responsible. It broke up the family
settlements of the higher classes by in-
ducing the secondary heirs to travel. In
every way it has been, and still is, break-
ing down the walls between peoples and
classes and levelling all off into one homo-
geneous mass. Also, transport has been
an immense stimulus to mechanism, a
development which has altered the
whole face of society by giving power
to those who know how to control
machines.
It is much easier now for defectives
not only to survive, but to prosper and
make their force, or lack of it, felt, with
a corresponding change in the mass
effectiveness of society. Great families
still produce great men of course, but
their degenerate members keep dragging
them down in the estimation of
the people; and universal education
enables the people to know much more
than they once did about the skeletons
in the cupboards of the rich.
I can understand how people like
“Noblesse Disoblige” come to scoff
at lineage, and I don’t support the re-
storation of any kind of privilege. But
I do hope that we will gradually apply
control to our own mating and breeding
based on knowledge of genetics. Know-
ledge of ancestry and lineage will then be
useful in deciding the suitability of a
proposed match, not only as it reveals
weaknesses and diseases, but also as it
enables a choice to be made based on
known genetical laws.
Love didn’t enter into matchmaking in
ancient times (or in our own, in many
eases, until recently); so there is reason
to presume that it may again be placed
more or less in the background by an
enlightened race.
A Satchel of Books
The Home for August is unusually
social; that master-gossiper Tommy
Cochran has about twice his usual quota
about life in the West End of London.
But the most interesting items are literary
and artistic. They include another instal-
ment of C. H. Bertie’s “Picturesque
Rascals” series and a couple of tine color
reproductions of paintings which will be
exhibited at Norman Lindsay’s forth-
coming show in the Macleod Gallery.
Mufti, the official organ of the
R.S.S.I.L.A. (Vic. Branch), is different
from most soldier publications. The
Digger is beginning to express an in-
terest in such sinister phenomena as the
armaments ring, the glaring disharmony
between the statesmen’s pious prayers for
peace and their active manoeuvring for
position for another war, the equally
glaring discrepancies between the politi-
cians’ promises when they are angling
lor soldiers’ votes and their performance
when they are in office. Mufti has
correspondents in Washington, Rome and
Paris, a section for kids and humorous
sections which recall “Aussie” in war-
time.
The Diary of Mrs. Pepys, by F. D.
Ponsonby Senior (Hurst and Blackett;
Robertson and Mullens ; 7s. 6d.). The
writer who attempts to forge the sort of
diary Mrs. Pepys might have written if
she had been the sort to write a diary
has a hard task before him. Mrs. Pepys
was a penniless beauty of 15 summers
when Samuel married her, and he treated
her with amused contempt as the rather
childish person she probably was. He
never allowed her feelings to interfere
with his numerous infidelities. The diary
of such a woman would probably not
be very interesting or infused with much
understanding, but Mr. Senior makes it
mildly amusing by exploiting the lady’s
natural jealousy and bringing in a drama-
tic finish which has nothing to do with
history. Pepys goes blind and Mrs.
Pepys rejoices in a new position which
makes her indispensable to him. Actu-
ally, she died of typhoid at 29, which
was the normal expectation of life in
those unhygienic times, while Samuel
flourished another 40 years.
Short Stories, Scraps and Shavings, by
G. B. Shaw (Constable; Booklover’s,
Melb. ; 11s. 3d.). This collection goes
back 50 years. How many writers could
stand such an exposure? G.B.S. comes
out of it with flying colors. His ideas
of Shakspeare, the drama, music, war and
society generally seem as sound now
as they were when he first offered
them to the world, which at the time
attacked their author as a megalomaniac.
“Death of ail Old Revolutionary Hero”
(1905) is a gorgeous picture of a Labor
stalwart who opposed every piece of pro-
Labor legislation because it did not reach
absolute perfection. In “The Emperor and
the Little Girl” (written for a Belgian
charity in 1916) the Kaiser goes for a
walk in no-man’s land to convince him-
self that he is as brave as his soldiers.
There is a previously unpublished act
from “Back to Methuselah”; also the
whole of the more recent “Adventures
of a Black Girl in Her Search for God.”
It is difficult to understand why Shaw
likes his books to be illustrated by John
Farleigh, whose art-attitude is the anti-
thesis of Shaw’s attitude towards litera-
ture.
A Message from the Sun and Stars in
Australia's Rainfall Records, by G. W.
Nowland (Wellington “Times,” N.S.W.),
contains 111 pages, mostly filled with the
rainfall records of Australia for as far
back as there are any, with especial refer-
ence to the droughts and deluges of
Tamworth. Interspersed with these are
extracts from prophecies inscribed in the
Great Pyramid, disquisitions on the
Bruckner wave theory, the precession of
the equinoxes, the centenary cycle, the
34-year cycle, the 28-year cycle, the
7-year cycle, the 11-year cycle, the 10-
year cycle, the 103-year cycle, the 23-year
cycle, various combinations and permu-
tations of these cycles and notes on the
influence of the planets upon seasons and
financial affairs of this weary world. To
follow Mr. Nowland’s reasoning is im-
possible—he mixes his cycles too vigor-
ously—but he concludes that Australia
will enjoy good seasons in 1942-43-44-45,
but that between then and now there will
be a series of bad droughts caused by
Jupiter.
The Outlook of Science, by R. L. Wor-
rall (John Bale, Sons and Danielsson;
Bs. 6d.), is a tilt at the authors of recent
quasi-popular books on scientific de-
velopments—notably Lodge, Eddington
and Jeans—who have indulged in what
Dr. Worrall (his degrees are medical)
calls a flood of philosophical idealism
and mysticism.” The author raises the
banner of uncompromising materialism,
and in a chapter which Einstein (accord-
ing to the preface) read with approval,
states the Einsteinian hypotheses with-
out recourse to metaphysics. Dx*. Wor-
rall includes psychology, biology and
aesthetics in his concise and logical sur-
vey, covering therefore a more compre-
hensive field than most of the philo-
sophers he assails, but he finds nowhere
any reason to discard commonsense. He
writes plain English, and has no trouble
in expounding the most complex of
modern theories in that medium. If he
were American his title might have been
“Science Debunked.”

TOURISTS AND TAX-
GATHERERS.
Australia is repeatedly assured by
U.A.P. politicians that its recovery from
the plight to which it was reduced in
1931-32, when it seemed to be rushing
to ruin, has extorted the admiration of
the world. Politicians are prejudiced wit-
nesses, but British newspapers have no-
thing to gain by exaggerating the facts,
and sober journals like the “Financial
Times” have said much the same thing.
Sometimes they add that the British
investor is full of gratitude to and in-
terest in the Commonwealth. The Brit-
ish investor is indistinguishable from the
British tourist. It is strange that he should
so rarely seek to improve his know-
ledge of the country which has been so
careful of his investments and has made
such sacrifices to pay his interest, especi-
ally when £lOO English is worth £125
Australian.
In proportion to population, Britain
still leads in output of tourists. Every
year myriads of them go abroad for
change of air and scene, sunshine and
surf-bathing, field sports, mountaineering,
ski-ing, shooting and fishing. Australia
offers them all these attractions and more,
together with cheaper hotel accommoda-
tion than they can get in their own coun-
try, and better food than can be had any-
where else in the world. Articles that
are luxuries to Britons—such as oysters
and peaches, pineapples and table grapes
—are procurable in Australia for a frac-
tion of the London price. And the risk
of catching some dreadful disease from
natives or animals is negligible. Hydro-
phobia, typhus and cholera are un-
known ; typhoid in settled parts is becom-
ing as rare as smallpox ; with 36 deaths
per 10,000 persons living in Queensland,
as against 166 in France and 240 in Fin-
land, tuberculosis may also be said to be
within measurable distance of extinction.
Maoriland and Australia have, in fact,
the lowest death-rates in the world. For
every British tourist who goes to Queens-
land, 20 or 30 go to Egypt and Ceylon ;
yet Queensland’s crude death-rate— i.e.,
number of deaths per 1000 of annual
mean population—is 8.1 as against 20.5
in Ceylon and 26.8 in Egypt; rates of
infantile mortality are 41 in Australia,
106 in Italy, 160 in Egypt and 162 in
Ceylon. 'And crime is as rare in the
Commonwealth as it is in the United
Kingdom ; the English traveller is as safe
here as at home. That is, he would be
if he came ; but he seldom comes.
The regimentation of Germany and
Austria and the risings and shootings
have made those countries unhealthy for
tourists. France has become too dear
for all except the rich ; besides, the in-
ternal situation of the Republic is far
trqm secure. This is also the case with
Spain, a country which, in any case, lacks
the conveniences that tourists nowadays
demand; and only the curious visit
places like Russia, Poland, Turkey and
the Balkan States. But all sorts are going
to Italy, which is cultivating the tourist
trade for all it is worth. The Fascist
Government arranges programmes to suit
all tastes and purses, announces them six
months to a year ahead, puts out seduc-
tive magazines and folders, the work of
accomplished journalists and photo-
graphers, and capitalises the curiosity
about Mussolini. So the English flock to
Italy to smell Naples and perhaps die ;
but, though they could get 25 p.c. on their
money by transmitting it to the Com-
monwealth, they avoid Australia as if it
were a contagious disease.
They are not alone in this. There is
an incessant outpouring of Australians
from Australia. It began in the first de-
pression year, and, although it dimin-
ished a bit last year, it is increasing again.
Overseas-migration statistics for the first
six months of 1934 show that departures
exceeded arrivals by 4693. No doubt
hundreds of cricket enthusiasts went to
England with return tickets (incidentally,
there are more Englishmen than Austra-
lians interested in representative cricket,
but very few took advantage of the
exchange to follow Jardine’s team
about); but they figure as “Aus-
tralian residents departing temporarily.”
Of the rest, 6483 were classified as
“Australian residents departing per-
manently,” 5736 being of British
descent; “permanent new arrivals” num-
bered 4818, of whom 3403 were British.
So there was a net loss of 2333 British,
and of 1665 Europeans ; the difference
was made up by (among others) 513
Italians, 65 Poles and 57 Greeks.
Why do so many Australians leave
Australia not to return? And why do so
few Britons arrive? The only feasible
explanation is that bad taxes drive out
good people and keep others from com-
ing in.
One advantage of going to a foreign
country for a holiday or for a long stay
is that, while it lasts, a man can escape
the income-tax pests. He can’t escape
them if he comes to Australia. They will
be at him as soon as they learn that he
is, within their reach and is suspected of
having drawn income, no matter whence.
Not one set, as in Britain, but two sets
at least; perhaps three, four, five, six
or seven sets if he decides to make a pil-
grimage round the States. The Common-
wealth lot will want to know all about
that £4OO or £5OO he had transferred
from his London bank, and will warn him
that Commonwealth tax is payable on
income from abroad, and also on ex-
change. The N. S. Wales crowd will
order him to account for every pound of
income he receives in excess of £1
(“penalties, £lOO to £500”), and tax him
lOd. in the £ whether it comes from Pim-
lico or Greenland. And the longer he
stavs the more he will be persecuted and
bled.
"My small income,” a correspondent
writes, “is derived entirely from the U.K.
It is barely sufficient to maintain my large
family. Every penny of it is spent in
the State, so the State must benefit; but
the State taxes what has already been
taxed in the U.K.” “I am a retired naval
man,” another writes, “with a pension for
long service and good conduct (22 years
of it, including the entire period of the
war). My pension is taxed in England
and again in Australia.” A third, com-
menting on these cases and others,
observes bitterly that “British folk here
all have friends at home who are kept
informed of this kind of thing.” He
points out truly that the N.S.W. “special”
income tax, formerly levied for unem-
ployed-relief but now raised for addi-
tional purposes, is a gross infraction of
the double-tax agreement, which provides
that “taxpayers doubly charged may
claim an allowance at half the British
rate or at the Dominion rate, whichever
is the lower.” The “special” tax was im-
posed after the agreement was arrived at,
and N. S. Wales takes advantage of the
fact that it is not a Dominion.
Tourists will not come to nor will
sojourners stay long in a country where
they are harried and cheated. But they
would come and remain in multitudes if
assured of fair treatment; that is to say,
if tax-exemption certificates were avail-
able to travellers, if the double-tax agree-
ment were scrupulously respected, and if
the income-tax business could be so
ordered that one return and one payment
would be sufficient, as in England. In
the past, Australians have had to import
capital and population, and have paid
dearly for both. With exchange so favor-
able to the tourist, and with Germany,
Austria and France out of the field, they
now have a chance of getting considerable
supplies of both without paying a cent;
and politicians and - taxgatherers are
flinging it away.
A WORLD UNDER ARMS.
From the English Channel to the China
Sea every country is full of uniforms and
of men with arms in their hands. Even
the police go armed. Between the last
bobby seen at Folkestone, with nothing
more lethal than an arm-band about him,
and the first turbaned copper fortified
with an umbrella in an Indian border
town, there are French gendarmes and
German Betraeger with revolvers, Aus-
trian Schutzpolizei and Turkish gen-
darmes with rifles, Bulgarians, Rou-
manians, Jugo-Slavs in pairs or threes
with cartridge belts, and a few assorted
civil forces with machine-guns.
Apart from these reminders that civil
disorder does not pay, one male in
Europe in every nine between the ages
of 15 and 49 wears a military uniform —
6,000,000 in all, of whom 2,000,000 are in
regular armies. There are another
18,000,000 trained reservists. Belgium,
with a population about equal to that of
Australia, has 93,000 regulars and 495,000
reservists. Germany has recently added
£34,000,000 p.a. to her annual Defence
Budget. Italy, when the Austrian
situation became critical, was able to
mobilise 160,000 men immediately and to
send 60,000 of them to the Trieste border
within a few hours —“the quickest
transfer of troops in history.” And
France has built along her whole Rhine
frontier an underground trench line which
is in places 100 yards deep. Believed to
be impenetrable to shell fire, it has an air-
pressure system against gas, is equipped
to feed, house and water millions of men
for months on end, and possesses guns
enough to sweep clean of every living
thing a belt of country 10 miles wide, so
that “even a grasshopper could not live
on it,” as one visiting authority declared
recently.
The thing cost nearly £30,000,000 to
lay down with conscript army labor. Yet
even with this the French do not feel
safe. They fear a Germany strengthen-
ing herself every day in the air. The
same fears are alive in Britain.
Says Winston Churchill:
Germany is arming fast, and no one is
going to stop her I dread the day
when the means of threatening the heart
of the British Empire may pass into the
hands of the present rulers of Germany.
Stanley Baldwin has told the Commons
that the “old frontiers have gone and
that, when you think of the defence of
England, you no longer think of the
chalk cliffs of Dover ; you think of the
Rhine.” This statement can be easily
understood in the light of an exposition
by Cunningham Reid, M.P., formerly on
Sir John Salmond’s staff:
We have a machine to-day that can go
four miles up in the air within 17 minutes
of the alarm being given. The time in-
cludes the giving of the alarm when not
expected, the waking and dressing of the
pilot, his getting into his machine, warm-
ing-up the engine and taking-off.
Mr. Baldwin says that the “same feel-
ing of apprehension which we all feel
about London is felt in Berlin.” Cer-
tainly Hitler’s official paper, “Volkischer
Beobachter,” insisting on Germany’s
right to build 2800 ’planes for defence,
avers that there are “7000 military ’planes
on the Continent,” excluding Russia and
Britain, and shows every apprehension
that France will attack in a “preventive
war” ; while Louis Barthou, France’s
aged Minister for Foreign Affairs,
whose conscription law of 1913 alarmed
the Germany of his time, said to an
American international correspondent:
“A year ago I wrote that war could not
possibly come in 1934 ; to-day I can no
longer express the same opinion.”
Only Mussolini seems confident. He
says there will be no war for ten years.
For all that, Europe has her Saar, her
Dantzig, her Austria and her Balkans,
with armed men staring at each other
against every border, with mutual fear
driving nations into incongruous huddles
—Poles and Russians and French against
Germans; Germans sullenly watching
Austria and Czecho-Slovakia and the
coalfields taken from them ; Britain and
Italy standing aside but adding to their
air forces and their navies ; Japan and
Russia glowering at each other across the
Manchurian border, and the U.S.A. un-
easily transferring her fleet from ocean
to ocean, never knowing where the storm
will break.
Australia has something to be thank-
ful for in her remoteness. She does not
gaze across a foreign frontier at steel-
topped machine-gun cupolas set up half
a river’s breadth away on land which
once was hers, as do the Germans in
Kehl, where a stone can be thrown from
the Strasburg bridge centre to the ad-
vance posts of the French defensive line.
No 900 miles of rusty barbed-wire
separates us from some adversary, as it
does Pole from Russ. We can look
over every Australian border without see-
ing in the distance cavalry wheeling
in a pass against the day they have to
fight us —a usual diurnal experience on
the Bulgar-Yugoslav border.
But this is no reason for sleeping. There
is no room for truculence in Australia’s
attitude to the world ; but, with all the
world arming and tempers everywhere
in tatters, we must be prepared to help
our sister-nations and to protect our-
selves.
"NATIONALISED” LOSSES.
Westralia has had another issue of
trouble in large quantities, and this time
it can’t blame the Federal octopus. The
Commonwealth is indeed an aggrieved
party, since a lot of its soldier-settle-
ment and migration money has gone
west.
John Forrest established the Westra-
lian Agricultural Bank in 1894 to “pro-
mote the occupation, cultivation and
improvement of agricultural lands of the
colony.” Funds were originally raised
on 5 p.c. mortgage bonds with 20 years’
currency, redeemable by annual draw-
ings which began six years after the
date of issue. In the early days there
was a strict limit to the bank’s powers.
Lending capacity was restricted to
£lOO,OOO by the first Act, but in ten years
the maximum had been raised in jumps to
£500,000. Later, group-settlements and
soldier-settlements were added to its re-
sponsibilities, and with the Common-
wealth ready to shell out millions the sky
became the limit. The original confine-
ment of lending to improvement advances
widened till it embraced every activity,
from paying off old debts to giving the
family a car. Interest went up from 5 p.c.
to 7 p.c., but came back to 5 p.c., except
to soldier-settlers, who enjoyed a lower
rate.
By 1925, when a commission surveyed
the south-west group-settlements, which
accommodated immigrants and A.I.F.
men, all settlement finance schemes were
beginning to suffer from political ague,
and their controllers were foreclosing on
people to whom they had flung cash so
airily a few years before.
Group-settlers had been dumped down
at a cost per settler of from £1468
to £1758. By the end of 1927
some of them were saddled with an
advance and interest liability of over
£3OOO, and their interest bill was £3 a
week. It did not stagger them ; they
never paid it. Their holdings had, for
the most part, been hacked out of mag-
nificent hardwood forests in accordance
with a prevalent notion that forestry was
far less important than dairying. Another
commission that probed the cow-farm-
ing side of the venture in 1932 reported
that the majority of the settlers were
“capitalised 100 p.c. on present valua-
tions” ; in other words, their farms were
“fully owned by the State.”
In 1933 the State Auditor-General
pointed out that the Agricultural Bank
was “up” for £11,584,000. Of in-
terest amounting to £1,743,000 about
£1,450,000 was in arrear, and capital re-
payments were £1,500,000 behind. At the
end of that year 1080 farms were on the
institution’s hands —748 had been repos-
sessed from civilian settlers and 332 from
soldier-settlers; and dozens of properties
had during the year been taken over and
sold at a loss. A great plan for unload-
ing abandoned farms on residents of the
effete East seems to have miscarried.
A third Royal Commission, appointed
to inquire into the affairs of the bank,
has now completed the picture. It has
found that the capital loss made by the
bank, the soldiers’-settlement scheme, the
Industries Assistance Board (set up after
the 1914 drought) and the group-settle-
ments is £6,619,000. Amounts written
off group-settlement accounts at the
instance of Governments bring losses to
£11,304,000, and with estimated losses
added the total is reckoned at
£12,304,600, The bank “took” a
couple of millions from loan money
to fill the gaps between interest and
other receipts and annual liabilities, and
£1,193,000 was “obtained” from the
Industries Assistance Board in repayment
of interest due by settlers under the
board. Accrued interest due alone totals
£2,375,538. The State now has to find
£650,000 a year for interest and sinking-
fund payments on loans which have been
squandered—not by the Commonwealth,
at which so much objurgation is hurled,
but by Westralian State politicians and
officialdom carrying out an inebriated
policy of State paternalism.
It is no consolation to those who have
had a debt of £25 15s. per head hung
round their necks to be told that the
trustees of the bank had absolute dis-
cretion to make advances,’ exercised the
discretion “recklessly and committed
grave breaches of trust.” Nor is there
any comfort in the knowledge that “from
1914 to 1932 they had never placed the
true financial position before Parlia-
ment,” and that the yearly audit of ac-
counts had been conducted in a most
incomplete manner.”
The commission recommends that the
bank be placed under trustees free from
political control. It should never have
been susceptible to political control.
There is this to be said for the trustees
so roughly handled: they did not choose
the settlers, many of whom should never
have been placed on the land, and the
group-settlement experiment was in an
impossible position long before it was
thrust on them. The bank did not receive
deposits —which is lucky for the class
from which depositors are drawn. Still
its melancholy state is another warning to
the people of the perils that lie in
“nationalised” banking.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Thirteenth Parliament.
The thirteenth Parliament of the ‘Com-
monwealth is no more, and it expired un-
regretted. It is hoped that the fourteenth
Parliament will be an improvement, but
pre-selection may prevent it. Mr. Latham
leaves a gap which Mr. Menzies promises
to fill. Senator Lawson will be diffi-
cult to replace. In the nomination of
Senators the machines have had things all
their own way, and the results are sad-
dening. Taken by and large, the Senate
is not now conspicuously superior to any
of the Legislative Councils, and it might
be adjudged inferior to some.
Similarly, the late House of Represen-
tatives was much below the pre-Canberra
standard. Two things for which it will
be remembered are that it helped to
settle Lang’s hash and left the finances
much better than it found them. But the
salary grab was a disgraceful business,
and no party or faction is exempt from
blame, though the Country party was
perhaps the least culpable. And during
its term Secession developed from a small,
despised thing into a dangerous move-
ment. The Government is chiefly re-
sponsible for letting it thus grow, but
the House was not guiltless; members
in general evidently shared the Govern-
ment’s odd belief that you can solve
problems by appointing royal commis-
sions and choke discontent with a grant.
In conducting its business the House
followed the now-familiar formula. It
dawdled at the beginning of a session
and bolted at the end. Winding up
its 1933 “deliberations” it put through
26 bills at a sitting of 55 hours;
stopping only for meals and salary-grab
manoeuvres. At the dead finish it dis-
posed of 25 bills in 20 hours ; some of
them only the Minister had read. This
is no way to make good laws, but it is
the Australian Parliamentarian’s way;
the irregular has become regular. So
the lawyers get fat harvests of fees, and
the people get government by regulation.
Australia urgently needs new men and
vastly improved methods, but it is not
likely to acquire them while politics
remain under the control of the machines.

The Price of Bread
Some hours after the last Bulletin was
issued Mr. Stevens, the N.S.W. Premier,
told a Labor member in the Assembly
that he had “read a statement in a weekly
periodical that there was some proposal
to form a monopoly in connection with
the vending of bread,” but had “no
authentic knowledge of it.” However,
the Government had adequate powers to
deal with bread and flour prices.
Then a country member asked whether
the Premier had obtained the report
which he had promised on the relation
of bread prices to wheat prices. Further-
more, whether he knew that bakers were
stocked with flour bought at low rates
but proposed to raise the price of bread
on the basis of current wheat prices. The
Premier said the matter was under his
personal review. Before “Hansard” was
out with the report of his remarks, a
farthing was added to the price of the
21b. loaf in the city and the inner sub-
urbs and a halfpenny in “outlying areas.”
Meanwhile, the Farmers and Settlers
at their annual conference urged the
amending of the law to prevent millers
refusing to sell flour to bakers willing to
pay for it. One miller rushed into print
with an assertion that this is a “hostile
and vindictive demand.”
Authorship of the scheme which The
Bulletin outlined is acknowledged by
Mr. Raith, manager of the Sydney Auto-
matic Bread Baking Co. He is reported
to have said that he does not aim at
forcing the price of the 21b. loaf to 6d. ;
with flour at £9 155., bread at over
the counter and sid. delivered should
give a fair return. It certainly should ;
and they are the prices now. When
wheat was 9s. a bushel and flour £l9
a ton bread was 5-|d. over the counter
and 6d. from the carts. The draft agree-
ment circulated among master bakers
mentions sid. and 6d. with flour at £lO
per ton; “and for every rise or fall of
flour by £1 per ton the price shall not
vary more than id. per loaf.”
Mr. Raith, it seems, put out his pam-
phlet as plain Raith and not as manager
of his co. ; the Master Bakers
(whom The Bulletin did not men-
tion in that connection) were not in-
volved. Very interesting. On his own
responsibility, at his own cost and with-
out reference to those who employ him
as a master baker, Mr. Raith issues an
appeal to the general body of master
bakers to sign an agreement binding
themselves together “into a family
that will overcome all opposition.”
And he seeks merely to “put the industry
on a sound paying basis, to raise the stan-
dard of ethics in the trade and ensure
the public a bread of good quality at a
fair price” ; in effect, “the control of in-
dustry by men engaged in it,” which is
“their right.”
When Mr. Stevens finishes his “per-
sonal review” of the bread situation, he
might tell Mr. Raith and his friends that
master bakers and millers have no mono-
poly of “rights.” The consumers have
“rights” also, and it is the duty of the
Government to protect them.

League Debts.
After 15 years the League of Nations
has £2,000,000 owing to it by members.
This is something of an achievement
considering that the League has 57
members and that its annual Budget is for
£1,200,000, of which the British Com-
monwealth of Nations provides one-
ninth. Japan and Germany are among
the heaviest debtor countries, but others
assessed for only one unit of subsidy
also owe.
Britain pays most. She has 105 units
out of 1013 of expenditure to meet; then
come France and Germany with 79 ; then
Italy and Japan with 60, and India with 56.
Some of the assessments are difficult
to understand. Australia, with fewer
people and less interest in the League,
pays a third as much again as Belgium
and nearly three times as much as
Turkey—one of those countries whose
behavior inspired the alleged necessity
for a League.
What Geneva can do about its debtors
is hard to say. It can’t haul them up in
a police court and it can’t declare war,
because the basis of its constitution is
“not to begin hostilities without submit-
ting the dispute to arbitration or inquiry
during a delay of from three to nine
months.” If, therefore, any attempt
were made to put a bailiff in everybody
concerned in the outrage would become
“automatically in a state of outlawry”
and cut off from diplomatic intercourse
with San Domingo, Panama and Nica-
ragua, a disgrace which no decent nation
could be expected to sustain.
It is about time that Australia stopped
wasting money on the League. Our con-
tribution would pay the basic wage to
400 families. Possibly it does —but not
in Australia.

All After Judge Wells!
After the Darwin jury had expressed
“deep disgust at the way the authorities
handled the case and failed to procure
material witnesses whose presence would
have made a finding less difficult,”
Tuckiar, a Caledon aboriginal, charged
with the murder of Constable McColl,
was found guilty. The Judge sentenced
him to death and said he thoroughly
agreed with the jury. The aborigines in-
volved were not so primitive as had been
represented, and must be taught that they
could not murder a policeman in cold
blood and escape with a short sentence.
His Honor accused the Government of
not upholding his judgments in recent
cases: “the action it took was highly
improper.”
The death penalty has not yet been
abolished; but if the legislators want
to abolish it they should not do so by
back-door methods.
Laying on a Judge the onus of deciding
whether or not the death penalty shall
be inflicted for murder is something not
normal in British law courts.
Following the hearing of the case,
every busybody in the South has been
at work to save the Caledon Bay culprits.
The Association for the Protection of
Native Races, which was vigorously
criticised by Judge Wells some time ago
for its interference in the Stott case, has
launched a campaign. Another effort,
which received in “S. M. Herald” the
prominence of a war or a cricket victory,
came from a meeting which demanded
the release of murderers, the recall of
Judge Wells, proclamation of native re-
serves and the holding of future trials
on the scenes of alleged crimes. The
last two demands are sound, but the
source from which they came was
singular. The meeting, which the chair-
man announced as “non-political and
humanitarian,” was “convened by the
International Labor Defence,” a body
much given to defending people. It
carries on a campaign “against Fascism,
Social Fascism, White Terror, War and
Illegality,” apparently with ample funds.
However, it need not have exercised its
humanitarianism in this case if Canberra
reports to the daily press are reliable:
It is considered probable that the Execu-
tive will commute the death sentence on
Constable McColl’s murderer after a con-
sideration of the papers in the case.
But the problem of the native mur-
derer will not be solved by the commu-
tation of death sentences at Canberra.
If Mr. Perkins is incapable of devising
a plan which would both protect life,
white and black, and conserve native
rights, he should requisition the assistance
of experienced Territorians. Effective
patrols would cost less than the proces-
sion of trials which have cluttered the
Darwin courts for over a year.

Gifts to Diggers.
Save for a conditional legacy of £lO a
week and two annuities of £156 each,
gifts of a car and some jewels, Mrs.
Kirby, of “Mrs. Kirby and Son, Lead-
ing Funeral Directors, Elizabeth-street,
Sydney,” has left her estate in trust for
the relief of “necessitous returned sol-
diers and their widows, children and
grandchildren who may be necessitous.”
The returned soldiers must have enlisted
in N.S.W. and be Australian- or British-
born ; and they and their widows, child-
ren and grandchildren will be held
to be “necessitous” if they earn “only
the basic wage” or are “not possessed of
more than £200.” They must have had “ex-
perience on the land” or be the children
of fathers “who had such experience.”
Provided he conforms to these condi-
tions, an ex-warrior will be entitled to
apply for a lease, at peppercorn rental,
of virgin land, to be bought by the trus-
tee (the Perpetual Trustee Co.), 50 miles
or more from Sydney G.P.O. The trustee
is to decide what amount should be
“applied for the benefit of any one indi-
vidual,” but it “should not exceed £500.”
The trust is to go on until 20 years after
the death of “the last survivor of re-
turned Australian soldiers” who was
drawing a pension when Mrs. Kirby
died. Then leaseholders are to get the
fee-simple of their land and share equally
in such cash as remains.
The estate has been sworn for probate
at £177,600. Large as it is, if every
“necessitous” N.S.W. Digger with land
experience exercises his right to apply
for a lease it won’t go very far.
It is highly probable that the Equity
Court will be called in to elucidate the
provisions of the will and accelerate the
operations of the trust, as happened in
the German Verge case. Like Mrs. Kirby,
German Verge, a Macleay River grazier,
left the bulk of his estate for the benefit
of N.S.W. returned soldiers. After a
friendly action, in which all the
N.S.W. returned-soldier organisations co-
operated, a German Verge trust was set
up and a scheme of distribution devised.
It came into force in February, 1925 ;
since that date about £132,000 has been
expended in grants, loans, medical assist-
ance, purchase of small businesses, assist-
ance to vocational trainees and the like.
The fund has now been exhausted, and
any further distribution will depend on
repayment of loans.
The grandest bequest of the kind was,
of course, made by Samuel McCaughey.
He left £6oo,ooo—at least, accrued in-
terest is expected to bring it up to that
figure—for the technical education of
war orphans and of the children of
totally-disabled soldiers, and for their
maintenance while being trained. The
beneficiaries were not limited to any one
State, and a wide discretion was given
to the trust. To the end of June, 1933,
£411,000 had been spent, the number of
beneficiaries being 10,666. The noble
bounty of the dour old Irish pastoralist
is already bearing fruit, and the results
will endure. This can scarcely be the
case with the somewhat confused philan-
thropy of Mrs. Kirby and German Verge.
Italian Corporations.
Under Mussolini’s new corporation sys-
tem industries are marshalled—accord-
ing to productive cycle rather than
category—into 22 sectional bodies. The
first group includes partly-elective cor-
porations dealing with cereals, horticul-
ture and fruit, the vine, oils, beet and
sugar, animal and fish products, timber
and textiles. Then come machinery and
metallurgy, chemical industries, clothing,
paper and printing, building construction,
water, gas and electricity, mining and
glass and china. Finally, insurance and
credit, the professions and arts, sea and
air, communications, the theatre and
“hospitality in all forms,” which includes
hotels and the tourist traffic.
The planners decided against putting
artisans and craftsmen into a separate
corporation on the ground that they do
not represent any specific branch of pro-
duction, but rather a distinct form of
economic activity. Workers, therefore,
are represented equally with employers
on the corporations of their separate
trades, and also in the corporation of
arts and professions, “since certain
phases of their work rise to the dignity
of true artistry.”
Mussolini will nominate the president
of each corporation himself, and also
experts who may be drawn from a
National Research Council. Groups will
have presidents, as well as corporations.
The establishment of the new bodies
is only a first step. The corporation idea
is to be applied to politics, and is intended
to pave the way for a revision of the Con-
stitution under which the national Parlia-
ment will be elected to represent every
phase and class of industry.
It is a revolutionary move, but there
is a lot of sound sense in it —considerably
more than there is in the system of allow-
ing coteries of worn-out politicians to
drag other worn-out politicians, who are
sometimes incapable of casting a formal
vote themselves (as the N. S. Wales Legis-
lative Council elections last year showed),
to victory at the polls through a riot of
recrimination.

“Vulgar Insults.”
The Bulletin’s mail this week includes
a copy of “Die Briicke,” “organ of the
German Union of Australia and N.Z.,”
and of the German-Australian Chamber
of Commerce. In it, marked in red
pencil and printed in English, is a letter
from the president of the G.C.C. headed
“Insulting Australian Press Propaganda.”
The German community, it appears, is
“now passing through a time of news-
paper propaganda and journalism which
can only be compared with that during
the war.” Germans must read “vulgar
insults thrown by a no doubt one-sided
press against the honor of the nation and
its people.”
But the medicine is in the tail. The
writer knows that all such news “will at
once reach Germany,” and that it “can-
not help to solve those far-reaching pro-
blems of mutual trade between our coun-
tries, and particularly the impasse in
which Australia’s most important trade,
the wool trade [in very black letters],
actually finds itself, and all this trade
means and brings to Australia.”
Insult is a poor weapon, but it scarcely
does more than sting. It is not nearly so
painful to the ordinary individual as the
axe, even when the latter weapon is
delicately wielded by a gentleman in a
top hat. Nor so vital to the individual
who suffers it as the impact of a bullet —
General and Frau Schleicher might be
expected to agree with that if they lived.
Likewise Hitler’s deceased associates in
the Nazi revolution, of whom he said:
Even though they talk about the weather,
if three traitors secretly meet a foreign
diplomat I will have them shot.
But perhaps Australian newspapers
had better let Herr Hitler alone, and
Propaganda Minister Goebbels, too
—Herr Goebbels, whose short way with
English newspaper critics is to deport
them, and who stigmatised a represen-
tative of the sober “Daily Telegraph” as
“a lying correspondent.” Herr Hitler
and Herr Goebbels are sensitive plants.

Our Own Fuels.
Two movements are afoot in Queens-
land to produce power alcohol from
maize—one in the Lockyer and one, spon-
sored by A. W. Fadden, M.L.A., in
Atherton. The suggestion is that the law
should make it necessary for every gallon
of petrol consumed to contain a per-
centage of locally-manufactured fuel.
The schemes have so far not reached
fruition, but there is a basis for them
in what other countries are doing.
Maize alcohol can be extracted fairly
cheaply, and it produces a range of by-
products which have a steady market.
South Africa has a plant at Germiston
which cost £65,000 to erect. It was in-
stalled under the supervision of Dr.
Arnstein, chief technologist to the Bald-
win-Southwark Co. of U.S.A., who
reckons the cost of extracting 99.8 p.c.
pure alcohol at 2ld. per gallon. From
200,000 bags (700,000 bushels) his esti-
mate of production is 1,600,000 gallons
of alcohol, 1000 tons of glycerine, 2000
tons of cattle feed (worth £2 10s. per
ton), 180,000 gallons of salad oil, 12,500
gallons of fusel oil, 5750 tons of dry ice
(worth £2B per ton), 200 tons of acetone
and 800 tons of yeast cubes.
With the best and cheapest maize land
in the world, Australia should be at an
advantage if the scheme is sound. The
Argentine Government has sponsored a
bill, passed by the Senate and now before
Congress, which, will compel the addition
of 30 p.c. of maize alcohol to petrol. In
France, mineral-vegetable fuel blends
were made legal in 1932 and about
55,000,000 gallons of absolute alcohol per
annum are sold there for fuel. Blended
min.-veg. petrols are on the market in
England as well as in S. Africa, and the
U.S.A. Navy is said to be holding over a
transfer to a Diesel-engine policy while
it investigates the new blending tech-
nique, which might reduce fuel costs.
Present production of maize in Aus-
tralia is about 8,000,000 bushels p.a. To
supply Australia’s fuel requirement in an
efficient mixture would need, if the spon-
sors of the idea have a sound basis for
their ideas, at least ten times as much.
It might be a wild-cat scheme, but it
is one which should be investigated in
a country likely to be robbed of its
transport if exterior supplies of petrol
were cut off.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Karaway”: The hawker of collar-
studs and boot-laces slouched on to the
verandah of our boarding-house and
stood eyeing a pair of newly-pressed
pants that were airing on a chair, without
suspecting that he was being watched
through the window-curtains. Getting no
answer to his knock, he snatched up the
pants and was rolling them up when their
owner, clad lightly in a shirt, darted into
the passage—there is no egress through
the window —and rushed frantically to
the rescue of his vanishing strides. He
would have caught the thief, too, only
for the diversion created by the landlady
in the hall. She had been coming on
slippered feet to say lunch* was ready,
but instead she threw up her arms with
a shriek and fainted. He and I co-
operated in rendering first-aid.

“Nakh”: Melbourne municipal coun-
cil debates are famed neither for learn-
ing nor good humor, but they hand the
public a mild laugh occasionally. Caul-
field Bumbles were discussing a complaint
from a local bung that the zeal of the
Salvarmy, which meets outside his door,
prevented customers from getting their
orders heard. Councillor Packer had a
bright thought: “Perhaps the licensee
would be satisfied if the band struck up
once in a while ‘Another Little Drink
Wouldn’t Do Us Any Harm.’ ”

“Oxmead”: “S. M. Herald” tells us
confidently that the word “news” is de-
rived from the initial letters of the four
“Would you like twin beds, sir?”
“No, they can sleep with us.”
major points of the* compass, denoting
anything fresh from North, East, West or
South. It is surely a fantastic and long-
exploded idea ; I can’t find any diction-
ary, from Webster downwards, which
mentions such a derivation except with
entire disrespect. The word obviously
came to England from the French nou-
velles, and the French got it from the
Latin novi —the Latin tag ex Africa
aliquid novi was encountered by most ot
us in our schooldays. Even if the com-
pass derivation had anything to recom-
mend it, the letters would have run
N.W.E.S., judging from the bridge hands
with which we are becoming so increas-
ingly familiar and reading the second
line, as is natural, from, left to right.
There was once a humorist who suggested
that Shakspeare’s line “When the hurly-
burly’s done” was a corruption of “when
the early purl is done.” I suspect that the
unknown who invented the compass deri-
vation of “news” was a leg-puller, too.

“Roto”: The danger of the sneak-
thief getting away with your milk (B.
1 /8/’34) has been overcome in the latest
English bungalows. A servitor panel is
let into the front door fitted with a com-
bination lock. Milk, bread or anything
else may be deposited therein by anyone
knowing the combination. On the re-
verse side the gadget becomes an ordinary
cupboard from which the housewife
collects her necessities. If you . change
your tradesman you merely change the
combination and notify his successor,
and there’s no chance of anyone break-
ing in to steal. In many places the post-
man is also given the combination, thus
ensuring the safety of your mail.
“Olet”: The King’s Hall meeting in
Sydney which clamored for more justice
for Black Brother sent me to the “Aus-
tralian Encycloptedia” to verify some of
the guesswork figures about our abo.
population. There I found many other
interesting things about Binghi, notably
this:
The body exhales an odor quite charac-
teristic of the race, noticeable by whites,
horses, cattle and dogs, just as the odor
of the white man, imperceptible to himself,
is noticeable by the black man.
Queensland footballers, among others,
have assured me of the truth of the first
part of this proposition ; also I had a dog
once, a Caucasian obviously, who, while
uniformly friendly to our own race, could
scent and resent an approaching colored
man hundreds of yards away. But the
“Encyclopaedia” goes a step further in its
discussion of this delicate subject:
Perhaps the Japanese is the only race
that is odorless in this sense.
It would be interesting to know if this
is so, and whether there is any evidence
to support it beyond the fact that the
Japanese in the bulk are about the clean-
liest of nations.

“M. de Paris”: If one thing were to
convince me more than another that
Middle Europe is returning to the social
culture of the Middle Ages, it would be
the story of the hanging of the two men
who assassinated the Austrian Chancel-
lor. An execution, whether with sword,
axe or rope, can be made a stately and
impressive ceremony. But imagine the
leading of the two subjects beneath an
ordinary beam, the attachment of a rope
round their necks and the hoisting of
them into the air to die by slow stran-
gulation! It is even mentioned that one
man’s sufferings were shortened by the
executioner leaping on his shoulders.
That confirms me in my Middle Ages
thesis. In Victor Hugo’s Notre Dame
Oliver le Daim does the same thing to
Esmeralda after dangling her at the end
of his rope.

“Hamilton Reach”: That yarn of the
motor-yacht which has just vanished
from the Brisbane River (B. 8/8/’34)
recalls a similar happening of some years
ago, when a small syndicate made
elaborate preparations to get away to the
“I never allow my clerks to kiss the typists.”
“Greedy!”
Solomons, or further. The boat’s owners
were away, and they carefully stocked
her with tinned provisions, arms and
ammunition, petrol and anything else they
could think of. They made a good job
of it, too, by stealing most of the stuff
from a carefully reconnoitred store the
night they left. It wasn’t till they were
well out to sea that they found they had
forgotten lubricating oil. As the engines
showed signs of seizing, they opened tins
of dripping and smeared the stuff on
the hot bearings. Naturally, the revolv-
ing cranks threw the burnt fat all over
the shop, and the ghastly smell, aided by
a heavy chop, brought the expedition to
ignominious disaster. The stalled yacht
and her seasick crew were grabbed a few
miles up the coast and lugged back to
Brisbane.
“Old Hand II”: Travel-
ling by tram the other day
through the thickly-popu-
lated district between Spit
Junction and Mosman
Bay, my mind went back
to my boyhood in those
parts. In the early ’seven-
ties I wandered, gun in
hand, through the present
jungle of bricks and
mortar shooting gillbirds,
with an occasional wal-
laby or kangaroo. There
was never a house but the
“Old Barn” and another
structure at the head of
Mosman Bay, where tea,
native roses and waratahs
could be had on Sunday
afternoons. Old Jack
Cannon, of Balmoral
grounds, was considered
dotty by us young men
when he advised us to buy land where
Spit Junction now stands.

“C. 8.”: The centenary “Eiffel” tower
to be erected on St. Kilda-road is not a
new idea. In the early optimistic days,
when half a dozen fresh projects were
being hatched every day, J. S. Goode, the
lecturer in Russian at the University, sug-
gested that such an edifice be planted in
Port Phillip Bay. The notion as a public
enterprise was turned down. Now Cen-
tury Tower, Ltd., has let a contract to
Johns and Wavgood which will result
in Melbourne having the largest air
beacon in the world. It will be
440 feet high, and will delve 75
feet into the earth on a block 70 feet
squai'e. The first of the three floors will
be given up to a. Continental cabaret and
lounges, the second will be a garden in
Spain and thence three high-speed
lifts will convey passengers 300 feet to
an aerial promenade. The final stage is
to be a platform where “many novel
entertainments will be provided.” Above
that will be a giant searchlight and a
Neon beacon, visible for 100 miles. The
whole edifice will be picked out with
Neon lights, and the promoters will have
to make it earn the interest on £55,000.
“Exdig”: “A.5.Q.” (B. 1/8/’34) is
quite right in saying that “all enlist-
ments were for general service,” but when
definite preferences were indicated they
were frequently honored —invariably, I
think, in the case of men who enlisted for
non-combatant service. The Diggers I met
whose grievances were most loudly ex-
pressed were those who had wished to
enter the Light Horse. Hundreds of
these, who plodded through the mud of
France with the infantry, always in-
sisted that they had been “chiselled.”
Recruiting officers rarely wasted time in
explanation. “If you want to get into the
Light Horse,” they would say, “you’ll
have to join for general service first,”
and that was generally the last the re-
cruit heard of his early aspirations.

“Barby”: How hard it is to pick up
a newspaper without seeing the Freudian
“inferiority complex” confused with a
simple sense of inferiority! Thus, for
instance, Mailey, commenting on Wood-
full’s return to batting form:
Some weeks ago Woodfull had developed
a serious inferiority complex, which made
him refuse to hit the meanest 'half -volley.
A serious inferiority complex would make
the sufferer much more inclined to try to
hit a six off. a deadly yorker.
“X.N.0.”: Cases of ships being struck
by lightning are rare, but the freighter
Barrhill reported one on reaching Fre-
mantle —she had set out from Rotterdam.
The wireless aerial, which could not have
been earthed* was responsible, and the
third officer was very sore when he picked
himself up; the compass, too, started
chasing its tail like a couple of mad
kittens. The only other case I can re-
member occurred when I was a cadet on
the old Britannia at Dartmouth. On that
occasion the principal damage was done
to the main truck, which came hurtling
down on deck. It was subsequently
placed in a glass showcase near the gang-
way, with a suitable inscription. That was
in 1903 ; the truck had been in place
since the Battle of St. Vincent in 1797.
THE TALLY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Jonah took the loco.
From Charlie Mack, he signed
A chit on which was written
A list of parts he’d find.
But ere he got to Raglan,
Uphill, two wheels were fiat;
And so he wired to Bathurst,
Where he had started at.
“Rear tender wheels are skidded,”
Was what he meant to send;
But telegrams get twisted
Or altered in the end;
And “Tender wheels are missing”
Was what the shed boss read :
His breath through shut teeth hissing,
The shed boss scratched his head.
Outside, beneath the window,
Sat Charlie in the sun.
The boss produced the message
And said “Look what you done!”
Then Charlie, fairly flummoxed,
Replied, in accents slow,
“Well, may my eyes be jiggered!
I counted them, I know.”

“D.E.”: Quarter of a century ago 1
was trying to run a Sunday paper in
one of the minor capitals. The place
was being bombarded with lottery pros-
pectuses and books of tickets from
Switzerland, and in a dull week our
“special” writer turned in a four-column
article, with alliterative headlines, in
which he denounced the cannonade as
a venal attempt to corrupt the morals
of a Christian people (he was the office’s
most inveterate punter), and gave the
Switzers beans. He dropped the subject
in the following week, a juicy murder
case having come along. A couple of
months later he stalked into the sanctum
with a cutting from the morning paper,
his face beaming. “Did y’ see this in
the cables?” he asked. Without pausing
for an answer he read it out:
Switzerland is suppressing the lotteries
conducted in that country, and is placing
a postal embargo on literature relating to
them.
“Must have been that article of mine,”
he went on —“I knew it would tickle up
the Swiss Government.” He was an-
noyed when I. laughed, for the man was
in deadly earnest; he was incapable of
joking about his stuff. “Struck you
funny, has it?” he hissed, and walked
out. It wouldn’t have “struck” me
“funny” if it had happened last week.
The world has narrowed since those
days, and members of the human family
are much better informed, though not
less touchy than my old friend. Testy
remarks made by or attributed to Kings-
ford Smith and Mollison have led ,to
their being refused permission to fly over
Turkey during the centenary race —which
means that, unless the Foreign Office can
mollify Mustapha Kemal, they may be
counted out of it. Gibes uttered by
obscure politicians or penned by insigni-
ficant pressmen may have more serious
repercussions at Rome or Tokio.

“Barkly”: If at any time in some far
N.Q. or N.T. settlement you come on a
perspiring individual violently pedalling a
bike which never gets anywhere, don’t
write him down as a candidate for a
mental hospital. He is providing power
for one of the 20 wireless sets now dotted
about northern Australia by the Inland
Mission, and principally used to call up
the hospital ’plane in cases of serious
illness or accident. The apparatus is
foolproof ;• the sender of a message
bangs it out on a typewriter device which
automatically translates the story into
Morse and puts it on the air while the
operator generates juice with his bicycle.

“P.S.C.”: Granted that Hindenburg
was an epitome of all that was best in
the Prussian Junker—-solid, fearless,
faithful to his hereditary ideals —I de-
cline to believe that he was
a great soldier. His “lime-
light” victory at the Masu-
rian Lakes was a much easier
job than it seemed at the
time. Further, apart from the
Old Man’s headship, the
whole thing was planned and
directed by Ludendorff, as
every junior S.A. knows to-
day. It was the same story
on the Franco-Belgian front.
The Junker general towered
like a shadowy colossus in
the background. It was
Ludendorff who devised and
directed strategy and tactics
on four fronts at once until
Germany broke. Just as
surely was Australia’s Brud-
enell White the brain behind
Birdwood’s reputation on
Gallipoli and in France ; and
the man who schemed and
launched the great attack on the
Turks in Palestine which ended at Dam-
ascus and Aleppo was not Allenby but
his C.O.S. Chetwode. Of all thankless
jobs under heaven, give me that of chief
of staff.
“Kali”: Long telegraph circuits, is it?
We had relay trouble on our Adelaide-
Sydney line and were unable to stop
Adelaide sending. As a stunt we flashed
him a stop memo, via America and
London. It travelled to Montreal, via
regenerators at Fanning Island and Van-
couver, thence to London, and from
London to Adelaide, again passing
though regenerators at Port Said, Singa-
pore, Cocos and Cottesloe. Adelaide
“’Sense me, miss, but did you say
come in or don’t come in?”
desisted 28 seconds after the memo, had
been dispatched, and acknowledged the
stoppage. Originally transposed into per-
forated tape for its initial section, the
message was transmitted automatically
for the rest of its world tour.
“Fakir”: That reference to water
diviners (B. 18/7/’34) reminds me that
the fraternity has been held up to rib-
shaking derision in Britain, where it has
a trades-union or something known as
the Society of Dowsers. As an answer
to the scoffers it held a great gathering
in Sussex to demonstrate the powers of
its members. The waterfinders tried first
and came a thud, failing even to locate
an underground pipe-line which most of
them crossed several times. The star
turn was to be the finding of a small boy
hidden in one of the many gorse thickets
in the vicinity. After hours of search a
tired and bad-tempered lot of dowsers
owned themselves beaten. The boy’s
“emanations” were not just right, or the
presence of many ribald spectators had
upset the etheric balance ; the truth was
that the kid had sneaked off to see a
cricket match.
*•* * *
“General Prac.”: “Shep” doubts my
statement (B. 25/7/’34) that during the
war doctors kept supplies of blood handy
“And that, my boy, was the part I played in the Great War.”
“Well, why did they want all the other soldiers?”
so that wounded men might be saved by
timely transfusion. It’s quite true.
Listen to this, written by an American
medico, Dr. R. H. Major:
In the World War blood transfusion
was extensively practised with most grati-
fying results, and in many field hospitals
quantities of blood, kept from clotting
by the addition of chemicals, were stored
for emergencies. On one occasion, during
a German advance, the British were forced
to abandon a hospital rather precipitously,
leaving behind a large quantity of blood
stored in jars and ready for instant use.
The British medical officers, we are told,
were much distressed to abandon so much
blood, but were later consoled with the
thought that some of the Germans would
perhaps be better men for having some
British blood circulating in their veins.
I should like to take “Shep” to a big
hospital and show him some citrated
blood waiting in its flask to save some-
body’s life. He would then know that
I’m not talking out of my turn.
“Chirurgeon”: Long ago in Western
Queensland 1 had a case where blood-
transfusion was instantly called for. The
only humans about were the man’s
amemic little wife and a couple of chil-
dren. The woman’s distress moved me to
cast professional etiquette to the winds
and use the blood of a remarkably fine
billygoat that used to draw the children’s
cart. The patient rallied at once, and 1
left, confident he would make a good
recovery. I was recalled two days later.
When I got there, the children were on
the roof of the fowlhouse, and the wife
began to explain that she had found the
patient that morning trying to eat the
flowers in the bedroom carpet. At this
stage of the narrative she was violently
propelled from behind into my arms by
her husband, who, like Nebuchadnezzar,
was on all fours with his mouth full of
grass. I must pass over what followed.
Suffice to say that when darkness came
and I descended from the tree I had
climbed, I called on the police to act.
They refused to do so, and we had re-
course in the end to the poundkeeper. A
fortnight in the village pound with no-
thing to eat but mildewed lucerne caused
my patient to return to normal—so much
so that he refused to pay the pound fees,
much less my medical charges.
* * *
“Shep”: In the last few minutes of
the boss’s time I’d read “Unemployed
Youth’s” diatribe against women steal-
ing men’s jobs (B. 8/8/’34), and as the
clock struck I streaked for the lift. Its
cargo was mostly male, the exceptions
being a pair of office flappers. At a
floor lower down two hardy toilers en-
tered. They had been tearing down a
partition wall and were in a hurry to
wash down the dust. Our hats were all
off. Theirs stayed on ; but they squeezed
back to let the girleens emerge first.
Then came withering looks at us, and
one of them bellowed “Wotcher all doin’
without yer ’ats? Spare me days, failin'
over yerselves to smoodge to shielahs
that’s doin’ yer out of yer jobs! ” Perhaps
he’s not far out.
* * * #
“Roxko”: 1 submit tiial the haka is
kept going by Maoriland football and
hockey players (B. 8/8/’34) because
it has become an institution, and
when it is omitted the onlookers feel
they are not getting their full money’s
worth. The M.L. Uni. hockey players
discovered this some years ago when
they decided to drop it. The uproar at
their first match and the demand for the
Maori war-cry had such an effect on the
team that next day their captain was
agitatedly rushing round Sydney trying
to find a Maorilander who could supply
the complete words of the slogan. Which
reminds me that at a M.L.-N.S.W. con-
test some years ago in Sydney the local
players listened interestedly while the
All-Blacks bellowed the haka, and then,
being apparently well-instructed therein,
gave the same war-cry with much more
vim and effect. Naturally they won.
* * * *
“Ex-P.8.1.”: “4 x 2” (B. 8/8/’34)
doesn’t put up much of a case for the
tin hat. Most line soldiers can recall
cases of h.e. shells bursting almost on
top of a man ; when the smoke cleared
away it would be found that someone
yards from the burst was riddled with
splinters. Our War Museum has a
British foreign-service pith helmet (of the
topee type) through the crown of which
ploughed the whole fuse of a German
shrapnel shell. The wearer was un-
harmed. Had he worn a tin lid, the
splintered steel would probably have
torn off the top of his head. Many
men were blinded through the brims of
their helmets being smashed into their
eyes; with the ordinary f.s. hat or cap
this could not have occurred. The most
that could be said for the abominations
was that they gave you a sense of secu-
rity. After one became used to them,
to be caught in a dinkum strafe without
a steel helmet was to feel that your head
was as big as a kite balloon and as
vulnerable.

POLITICAL POINTS
With wheat down last year, wool was
up. Now, with the wool outlook a bit
uncertain (though better since the threat
of an Italian embargo on purchases has
been withdrawn), wheat has gone to
3s. a bushel at Australian ports,
and London has paid 31s. 9d. a quarter
for Westralian parcels. In U.S.A. the
output will be the smallest for years—
probably 490,000,000 bushels, against
932,000,000 in 1931. So it may not be
long before the politicians can say again
“See what we’ve done for the wheat-
grower ! ”
There was a nice symbolism about the
signing of Commonwealth election writs
at Collector (N.S.W.), having regard to
last year’s salary grab. Collector was
one of the haunts of “Starlight.”
The reconstructed N.S.W. Leg. Council
has filled its first casual vacancy, and this
time there were no allegations that some-
body went round offering to wager £lOO
to 6d. that he wouldn’t get in. The seat
belonged to the late Dan Rees, a septua-
genarian coalminers’ union official
nominated by Lang in accordance with
his policy of satisfying the claims of
youth. For the next eight years (D.V.), it
will be the property of E. E. Collins,
a wool man from Wagga. Collins is
U.A.P.
Lang’s Inner Group has struck a
Federal-election levy on N.S.W. trade-
unions, and his newspaper publishes a
daily “barometer” to encourage the will-
ing and shame the unwilling. There are
many gaps where subscriptions should be,
notably in the case of the coalminers.
Ordered to find 10,000 shillings, the
coalies haven’t sent one. Instead, they
are making nasty remarks about the
machine owing them £3OOO and spending
£5OOO on the hire of radio stations for
Lang’s sermons against the banks.
Two Lang Labor candidates put up for
the vacant seat in the N.S.W. Upper
House. One, the Broken Hill Dickson,
got 39 votes out of 139 cast; the other,
Mrs. Webster, got a whole two. Mrs.
Webster is a Mother. Lang weeps copi-
ously about the wrongs of Mothers,
but he has no use for them as politicians
—only as voters.
The unity achieved by the four S.A.
Labor “parties” did not last long. One
of the Bardolph brothers, K.E. (D.H.
constituted one of the “Lang Labor par-
ties” in the Assembly), won the pre-selec-
tion ballot for Adelaide. Immediately
the result was announced, Comrades
McArthur and Blake said they were
coming out as Ind. Labs. Now Comrade
Yates, the former member, says he is
going to be in it.
There are some downy old birds
among the bankers whom mob-politi-
cians and projectors abominate. Bal-
larat’s little Banking Co. had its annual
meeting the other day and the manager,
A. S. Rusden, mentioned that he was
just on 70, had been 50 years a banker
and was still at large. “If I had applied
Douglas Credit principles to banking
practice,” he added, “I should be in
Pentridge.”
Disney, the Vic. M.L.C., threw a mild
bombshell into a recent sitting by giving
notice of a bill to provide for the steri-
lisation of the unfit. His idea is that
State medical inspectors should have
power to submit to a board of three
experts cases of children who are a
burden to themselves and society. He
would start with defective children, leav-
ing the case of the adults for later con-
sideration.
From the dawn of its history, British
Army and Navy veterans have had a part
in the making of Australia, and their
sons and grandsons were thick among
the warriors of 1899-1902 and 1914-18.
Nowadays, of course, the Imperial pen-
sioner who was a serviceman is more
numerous than ever before. Australia
has been getting a few of him, and could
get a lot more; but his small pension—
small by Australian standards —is taxed
in England and again in Australia. He
regards this as robbery, so he curses the
Australian politician and taxgatherer and
writes to his old regimental or quarter-
deck mates not to come.
His lips unlocked by the High Court
judgment, which was against him, Hogan
is giving the Trades Hall bosses some-
thing to go on with. “They ought to
talk about the Premiers’ plan,” the ex-
Premier thundered in Parliament. “/
didn’t cut the pay of civil servants on
£4 a week. They took 10 per cent, off
their £4-a-week men. and docked them
during their annual holidays.” There is
a lot of sympathy for Hogan in Victoria,
and if he came out for Ballarat he would
get a big vote.
NOT WITHOUT HONOR NOW.
“On the 50th anniversary of the day on which Lawrence Hargrave read the first
paper on flying by machine, flags were flown at Stanwell Park, where he constructed some
of his models, aeroplanes flew over'his house at Rusheutter Bay and speakers paid tributes
to him at Sydney University.”
Douglas Credit candidates are going
to cut into the votes of all the older
parties—heavily, in some cases. The
Labor factions will suffer most. Doug-
lasite promises of work and “national
dividends” for all, together with a
necromantic removal of taxes and public
debts, have caught heaps of half-baked
idealists who used to be captivated by
the Labor box of tricks, and Lang and
Scullin are not regaining them with dull
stuff about the banks. Here and there
Douglas Credit cranks are getting Labor
nominations, to the sore embarrassment
of Labor leaders.
Melbourne’s Great Dailies are bewil-
dering their devoted readers. The “Argus”
is booming J. W. Leckie, who is a manu-
facturer and a Protectionist. The “Age”
is sneering at Leckie —or allowing cor-
respondents to sneer —and praising his
opponent, Senator Bob Elliott, who is an
Imperial Freetrader. One of its writers
compared the “petrified” Leckie, “about
70,” with Elliott, “aged 48, virile, with
ability and determination to think and
act.” Leckie replied spiritedly that he
was the youngest of the three U.A.P.
men and was prepared to meet his critic’s
“pet candidate” in “any of the recog-
nised athletic contests.”
When it seemed certain that Lang
would retreat to Commonwealth politics,
Lamaro, who was his last Attorney-
General, decided to follow him to
Canossa—that is, Canberra—and went
after the nomination for South Sydney.
After the familiar shindy, he got it, but
to the bitter regret of the young man
the electorate was shorn of Labor strong-
holds on which old Riley used to rely.
Long thought on the subject has led to
Lamaro resigning from the Assembly, but
in his letter to the “Tory” Speaker he
announced that if Watson (as South Syd-
ney is now to be called) did not
avail itself of his services he would
confer them on Leichhardt again. An
innovation diverting to “Tories,” but the
Inner Group may not be amused.
S.A. Labor Premiers have been an un-
lucky lot. Verran and Crawford Vaughan
had a term apiece, turned Nationalist and
were obliterated. Hill managed to get
out just before disaster smote his party,
but he immediately became involved in
an argument over the expense of trans-
ferring him to London; now he is to be
recalled. Richards, his successor, lasted
only a week or so. Until a few weeks
ago John Gunn seemed the excep-
tion. He led his party to triumph at
the general election of 1924, and was
Premier till the end of August, 1926.
when Bruce appointed him to the
Development and Migration Commission
at £2OOO a year. Now Gunn has fallen
ill, and has been threatened with im-
prisonment unless he obeys an order ol
the Vic. County Court.
Premier Forgan Smith, back in his
adopted country, is annoyed with J. Bull
for even daring to propose restriction
of beef imports. Very wrong of Bull,
no doubt, but possibly he thought the
plan might appeal to Foggy and his
friends, since restriction is the very core
of Labor policy. Restriction of immi-
grants, of supplies under the “orderly
marketing” system, of jobs to trade-
unionists, of seats in Parliament to
pledged comrades who win selection
ballots; even restriction of output in
some instances. Another case of the
crimes of Clapham being chaste in
Humpybong.
The establishing of base hospitals in
country towns, now the policy of the
N.S.W. Hospitals Commission, looks
good, and so does the replacement of
the pound-for-pound subsidy system with
one based on needs and merits, if the
thing can be worked non-politically. Base
hospitals such as that at Orange are valu-
able training centres for nurses, and
places like Bulli, where unemployment is
rife, deserve special consideration because,
in times of prosperity, they supported their
hospitals generously. N.S.W. donations
and subscriptions fell from £564,000 in
1929 to £192,000 in 1933. It says little
for the State lotteries, though unem-
ployment was the main cause.
Pronounced the loser of the Labor
selection ballot for Bourke (Vic.), and
the winner after the votes had been
counted again, Maurice Blackburn had
a majority of 616 over young Peters at
the second poll: Blackburn, 1573;
Peters, 957. When it was declared, the
ex-Speaker referred to “deliberate at-
tempts to vilify me and members of my
family,” adding that “but for Mr. A. R.
Wallis there would have been no second
ballot.” Wallis, for his part, asserted
that his man had won the first ballot
“by at least three votes” and .that anti-
Blackburn Trades Hall bosses had done
their darnedest to give the nomination to
the loser.
Consider the luck of Pearce, 33 years
in Parliament and for more than 18 of
them a Minister. There have been times
when the party to which Pearce belonged
—and he has changed his allegiance as
often as the Vicar of Bray —has been ex-
cessively unpopular in Westralia, and its
nominees have been rudely rejected. But
whenever one of these unpleasantnesses
occurred Pearce’s term has always had
three more years to run; and as often as
his time for re-election arrived the pen-
dulum has swung back sufficiently to
secure his return. If Pearce had been a
candidate this year he would have fallen
harder than Kingsmill. Three years
hence, if he is still a Senator, the seces-
sion movement is quite likely to be dead
and buried.
“Nitchevo”: “Good Ole Piddo” broke
the long silence that followed his flop
before the Privy Council with a London
interview in which he said he had found
much to ponder over as a result of a
visit to Russia. He added that he knew
the language sufficiently to make his own
inquiries. One only hopes that the vener-
able jurist’s Russian is less whale-like
than his English. For circumlocutory
verbosity—l am catching his style, I’m
afraid —in his native tongue the learned
gentleman has only one Australian rival
—the man who wrote “ ‘Why I Fight,’ by
J. T. Lang.”

The Royal College of Surgeons has
awarded the Jacksonian Prize (1933) to
Dr. Edgar S. J. King, of Melbourne Uni-
versity, for an essay on the pathology,
diagnosis and treatment of localised, rare-
fying changes in bones. He lifted this
prize in 1930, and he is still only 34. Dr.
King graduated (first-class honors) at
Melbourne Uni. in 1923, and he won the
Alvarenga Prize, which is awarded by the
Philadelphia College of Physicians, four
years later.
“H.W.M.”: Here’s a family record for
longevity that will take some beating.
Mrs. Rebecca Turner, of Prahran (Vic.),
is 87 ; her brother, W. Cranwell, Essen-
don (Vic.), will be 92 this month, and
two other brothers are in the seven-
ties. The nonagenarian was 66 when
he married for the second time, and his
first two children by the marriage were
twins.
Dr. Alexander Leeper, who has died
at 86, held the banner of classical learn-
ing aloft at Melb. University for close
on 50 years. He had a passion for Latin
plays, and was responsible for the

production of the first drama in Latin
by the students of Trinity. He was also
the first producer of Greek tragedy in
Victoria. He was president of the Public
Library board, and filled more honorary
jobs than any other don at the univer-
sity.
“Second Divvy”:—
No. 1 of the U.A.P. Senate team in Vic. is
Major-General Brand—and how pleasant it is
to be able to give a public man a military
title that he won in the field! Brand was in
everything from The Landing to the Hinden-
burg Line. He earned the D.S.O. and other
decorations for gallantry, eight mentions, and
two wound-stripes. He is 61, and gave up the
job of Q.M.G. of the A.M.F. last year. If
elected one of his chief aims will be to see that
war pensioners and unemployed soldiers get
their rights.
James (“Jimmy”) Thomson, who
passed out in Perth the other day at 82,
was an Irishman by birth and a press-
man by nature. He was writing for
country newspapers in Vic. as long ago
as 1868. He founded the Melbourne
“Evening Standard” (where, incidentally,
he gave the late Mrs. Macleod, then
Conor O’Brien, her first start), find some
comments of his on the case of the Mer-
cantile Bank led to his being fined £lOO
and given seven days for contempt of
Court. Jimmy never failed to refer to this
experience with pride. The early ’nineties
found him in Westralia, and there he
remained till his death. He founded the
“Murchison Times” at Cue, and ran it
for some years ; he started an evening
paper at Fremantle, and finally settled
down to freelance work, which he con-
tinued in leisurely fashion up to a year
or two ago. A kindly, genial soul, with
a real talent for descriptive writing and
a richly-stored memory, Jimmy left a
mark which was all his own upon the
Inky Way.
One of the delegates to Sydney
Farmers and Settlers’ Assoc, conference
was H. S. Henley, son of Tom ’Enley,
M.L.A. The young man acquired Basset
Downs, Cowra (N.S.W.), about a dozen
years ago. He runs Dorset Horn sheep
with which he has won prizes at
many R.A.S. shows, and the fame of his
fat lambs has reached Smithfield. He
has tried to break into politics as a C.P.
candidate, and means to have another
shot. Old Tom lost another promising
son in the war.
George Wilkins
(alias “S i r Hu-
bert” these days)
is stouter, trimmer
about the beard

face than when he
was last in this
part of the world ;
otherwise he is the
same old adven-
turer, and as full
of Enthusiasm as
ever for the new
worlds which he is
to conquer when
he returns from
his present tourist
trip to the Antarc-
tic and Byrd’s

schemes is the
establishment of a

He is young; he
is an eminent common-law man '(a
department in which the N. S. Wales
Bench was not strong); above all,
he isn’t a politician. He was educated
at Fort-street and Sydney Uni.; was

Judge. The general public first realised
his abilities when he appeared for Bishop
Dwyer, of Wagga, in the Liguori case.

broker, was killed in a car accident last
week, and thousands grieved who only
knew him by sight. He was an embodi-
ment of controlled energy. He played
first-grade cricket for North Sydney
before the war, and shone as a N. S.
Wales bowler against A. O. Jones’s Test
side. He was also a first-class golfer
and baseball player, and a fine swimmer.
A smallish, compact, balanced man, he
gave the impression of complete physical
efficiency that one notices in great boxers.
He even picked up a pen and moved
the papers on his desk with swift preci-
sion. It is hard to associate such vital
beings with death, for in some ways they
always remain boys. Les Minnett had
been a member of the Stock Exchange
for eight years; he was one of the
pioneers of Collaroy as a residential
suburb, and he would always go out of
bis way to do good turns —particularly
for anybody who played cricket or golf.
“S.T.S.”: The Biography legacy left by
Fred Johns allows £lOO to be given
every second year for a life, “extensive
and original,” of some departed Austra-
lian. The subject of the first competi-
tion was announced recently by Adel-
aide Uni.: George Fife Angas, founder
of the pastoralist family, and importer
of those South German and Danish
settlers who have done so much for
S Aus.
Captain Eugen Mathy, new Australian
representative of the N.D.L., was among
Australia’s first prisoners of war. He
was third officer of the N.D.L. Thuringen
when she was stopped near Fremantle
by H.M.A.S. Pioneer and told there was
a war on. Mathy (who first went to sea
aboard a Norwegian barque at the age
of 14) spent the war years in Austra-
lian internment camps, and then served
on German-American liners.
Here is a Frith
impression of J. B.
Chifley, campaign
director and leader
of the Federal
Labor party in N.
S. Wales. Six-foot-
odd of wire and
whipcord, he was
born and educated
in Bathurst, where
his father was a
b 1 a c ksmith. An
en g i ne-driver by
calling, he became
organiser and in-
dustrial advocate
for the Federated
Union of Locomo-
tive Engineers, and
he was elected
M.H.R. for Mac-
quarie in 1928. He
was licked by Lawson in 1931. and is
now having another stab at the constitu-
ency, every yard of which he has known
from boyhood. He was Minister for
Defence under Scullin.
Thomas Armstrong, elected at Detroit
(U.S.A.) as governor of the 76th Dis-
trict of Rotary International for 1934-35,
was old John Brown’s principal adviser
on industrial questions in the Newcastle-
Maitland district (N.S.W.). Brown’s will
appointed Armstrong his general
manager up north, and when the colliery
merger took place Armstrong became
deputy-chairman and consultant, with
the chairmanship of some of the subsi-
diaries. He has been a Rotarian since
the movement started.
Frank Wilmot, winner of Mrs. Dyer’s
£5O for a centenary ode, is better known
as “Furnley Maurice.” His “Ode to
Melbourne and Memory” was acclaimed
by the three judges as a poem of “beauty
and permanence.” Wilmot’s verse is to
be found in most of the anthologies, and
he has written plays. He is librarian
at Melbourne University.
Bert Levy has passed out at Los
Angeles. A Bulletin contributor in the
long ago, he was successful as a sketcher-
monologue-spinner in Australia, and even
more so in London, where he often
topped the bill at the Alhambra. In
the U.S.A. he became a star cartoonist,
a highly-paid entertainer, a studioland
host and guide, representative for J.C.W.,
Ltd., and Efftee Films, an inventor of
screen novelties and a producer of
“shorts.” Several now-successful Aus-
tralians in Hollywood have Levy to
thank for their rise. “Snowy” Baker will
probably step into his shoes as Aus-
tralia’s chief representative at movie
headquarters.
“X.”: Frank Walsh succeeds the late
W. H. Austin, another old Brisbane
Grammar School boy, as Under-Secretary
to the Queensland Labor and Industry
J. B. CHIFLEY, who wants to be M.H.R. for Macquarie
again.
Department. Sport is in the blood of
the Walshes and Austins. Though
Frank’s activities were mainly military in
his youth, his brother J.J., a leading
member of the Queensland Bar, played
Rugby for Queensland and was president
of the old Rugby Union.
An addition to the livestock of “White
Horse Inn” at Melbourne His Majesty’s
was a lamb, presented to Arthur Stigant
by Angliss, M.L.C. The Lamb Gift to
Britain idea, which has resulted in thou-
sands of carcasses being shipped overseas,
originated in Stigant’s fanciful brain.
Canon Bob Hammond, of Sydney, is the
only prohibitionist who runs hotels. Ham-
mond’s Hotels, where those who are up
against it can get food and shelter, are
well and favorably known from end to
end of the Commonwealth. His settle-
ment near Liverpool, where a number of
families have been put on cultivable
blocks, is a success, too. Most of the
settlers are raising vegetables or poultry
or both, and look like becoming the
owners of the properties they are working
and the houses on them in less than a
third of the time it would take under any
of the Government schemes. Sydneyites
of all denominations are agreed that if
this remarkable cleric were not devoid of
rancor and the capacity to use insulting
language, and if he were not the pos-
sessor of a good business brain and a
sensitive conscience, he might have made
a first-class party politician. He has a
great way with crowds.

The old C.8.A., floated in Melbourne
in 1866, was the most severely injured of
lhe banks which survived the storm of
the ’nineties. When it closed its doors
on April 4, 1893, it was holding about
£10,000,000 of deposits, half gathered in
Britain, and therein lay much of the
trouble. ' Even if all the old capital
(300,000 £lO shares had been issued and
paid to £4) could have been got in and
written off immediately, it would not
have straightened out the co.’s affairs.
Actually, after a painful struggle to get
in calls, all but £95,659 of the old capi-
tal was ultimately lost. With some excep-
tions, depositors received two-thirds of
the amount coming to them in 4\ p.c.
deposit receipts, and the other third
(£2,117,350) in 3 p.c. pref. shares, eligible
for 4 p.c. when conditions permitted.
Commenting on the scheme, the Chief
Justice of Victoria, on April 28, 1893,
said:
I think to-day that trustees are certainly
not placed in any worse position by the
scheme proposed—which I propose to
adopt—than they would have been in with-
out it. Apart from that, I think the scheme
is manifestly and palpably the very best
thing that could be adopted So far as
1 am able to judge, it promises a career
of success for this institution.
The worst of the wreckage was passed
over to a separate concern, the Special
Assets Trust, the bank being responsible
for its debts. Everybody was paid 20s.
in the £, and the Trust was wound up
in 1919. Meanwhile, general-manager
H. L. Heron had laid very solid founda-
tions, upon which a large and sound
banking structure has since been erected.
As the eye sweeps down the column
in the table devoted to dividends one is
apt to get the impression that the busi-
ness has been highly prosperous, whereas
only moderate returns have been won.
Since 1920 shareholders have subscribed
£3,808,682, one half capital and the other
half share premiums, which were sent to
reserves. Divs., which began in 1921, are
therefore worth no more than half the
declared rates on all but £95,659 of the
ord. capital. The prefs. shared in the
new issues, which were in the nature of
bonuses to shareholders, because the
scrip Commanded a premium in the
market.
During the 12 months covered by the
latest accounts a growth of £1,403,733 in
current accounts and of £798,038 in in-
terest-bearing deposits was accompanied
by an expansion of £1,424,785 in the book
value of advances and of £889,805 in
low-interest-bearing liquids and cash.
Despite this and a bigger exchange busi-
ness, gross earnings were £1079 lighter,
due to causes frequently explained in
these columns:

Salaries increased by £6153, of which
£2752 was offset by savings in other
exes., leaving enough to pay the pref.
div. (£84,694) and show 6.2 p.c. on ord.
capital as against 6.4, 5.7 and 11.1 p.c. for
the three preceding terms. On capital
and reserves combined, the year’s profit
was a mere 3.2 p.c., and that is a shade
above the general level of banking profits
in Australia, which is lower than for most
other-countries in the world. The nomi-
nal rate of div., which had been steady
at 15 p.c. for many years, was kept at
5 p.c.

There has lately been a lot of loose
talk about “watering” capital. Any con-
cern which has issued bonus scrip has
been accused of it, irrespective of
whether the gift has come out of accu-
mulated real profits or out of water or
hot air pumped into the assets for the
purpose. Very few cos. have actually
watered their capital. This highly suc-
cessful Auckland-controlled fire and
marine office —fish swim into its net from
all quarters of the globe—has a paid
capital of £1,500,000, of which £1,200,000
has been transferred from genuine re-
serves or real profits since the end of
1912; the co. was then 53 years old.
Indeed, instead of injecting water into
its assets, the co. has kept their book
value below market value. At the close
of last accounts £147,585 was brought
from hiding and put in the window ; and
still the market value of securities ex-
ceeded their book value, the auditors say.
It was the phenomenal leap in ship-
ping values during the war that sent pre-
mium income up with a rush —indeed,
there was more business offering than
cautious underwriters cared to accept.
The success of the British Navy in deal-
ing with the submarine menace kept the
loss rate down, enabling large profits to
be won. Instead of all being distributed
as they were earned, a substantial
portion was kept in the business. Capi-
tal thus became entrenched behind a
high wall of protective reserves invested
in sound securities. Meanwhile, interest
and rents have, for the most part, fol-
lowed closely on the heels of advancing
divs., leaving the bulk of underwriting
surpluses available to swell Investments
and returns therefrom.
The sharp spring in last year’s net
earnings was due to an improvement of
£57,489 in the underwriting surplus
(£110,593), following one of the most
favorable loss experiences since the be-
ginning of this century:

•General. tSan Francisco disaster.
The shrinkage of £7202 in net premium
income, despite firmer values, bigger
pay-rolls and larger stocks of merchan-
dise generally, suggests a more rigid selec-
tion of risks. Still, the loss rate, down
£6 Bs. per cent., making the drop £9 6s.
per cent, over the last three years, is
largely an uncontrollable factor. The
return from investments (£117,702) was
£2342 lighter at 7.8 p.c. on capital. The
net return from all sources was 15.2 p.c.
on capital as against 11.6 p.c. and 10.4
p.c. for the two preceding terms.
To celebrate the co.’s diamond jubilee
a 6d. bonus went out with the final div.,
making Y2\ p.c. for the year. The bonus
and disclosure of inner reserves surprised
the market, and the pound shares rose
sharply from 60s. to 625. At the higher
figure the return is 4 p.c. on a \2\ p.c.
distribution, or 3.2 p.c. on a 10 p.c' div.
basis. The cover is 375. 6d. in net tan-
gibles.
Here is the position as balance-sheet
figures show it:

Appearances are that the inner reserves
disclosed came mostly from public securi-
ties, up £130,700. Policy-holders could
see net tangibles equal to 280 p.c. of the
year’s net premiums, or 130 p.c. more
than is usually considered adequate.

There was a marked increase in the
number of passengers and the quantity
of cargo carried, and the subsidiary,
Hobson’s Bay Dock and Engineering Co.,
showed “improved results,” too —the cur-
tain is kept drawn over its figures. In
the coal trade things were not so good ;
but the co. has no capital directly in-
vested here, its interests being confined
to agency and carrying work. Also,
earnings were assisted by returns from a
fine wad of investments outside the busi-
ness —Consols, £162,988 ; fixed deposits,
£142,000 ; debentures, etc., £16,300 ; total,
£321,288. Shares in other cos., chiefly
the subsidiary, figure at £41,371. The
accumulation is the result of the sale of
surplus tonnage when prices were high
and of liberal allowances for deprecia-
tion and other contingencies during the
boom years. The co. was unable to find
employment for the money in the busi-
ness, owing mainly to competition from
rail, motor and air transport.
The board wrote the year’s profit
£5825 better than the 1933 figure at
£31,494, or enough to pay the pref. div.
and show 8.8 p.c. on ord. capital. The
difference between the profit claimed
and that shown in the table represents net
additions to various reserves, chief of
which is provision for depreciation,
special replacements, contingencies, etc.
(£377,682, up £14,223). Taking these net
additions into the reckoning, and again
allowing for the pref. div., the year’s
result was £l7O lighter at 13.1 p.c. on ord.
capital as against 13.2, 9.5, 2.2, 18.7, 11.7
and 13.5 p.c. back to 1928. The div.
was kept at 6 p.c.

To add £32,715 to the book value of the
fleet, carry an extra £12,868 of invest-
ments and cash and £7706 of debtors’
balances, the board went outside for a
further £32,690. Still, the more or less
liquid surplus (£343,477, including
stores) was only £ 11,231 lighter than at
the previous balance. There will be no
need to call upon shareholders to meet
the balance of expenditure on the new
10,000-ton passenger and cargo motor-
vessel Duntroon, which is expected to be
ready in July, 1935. The Dimboola, the
co.’s only passenger ship at the moment,

The volume of trusts is not disclosed,
nor are interest and other earnings
separated in the sheet. Still, it is plain
that the co. does a substantial business,
which is steadily expanding, due partly
to the complications which slump and
recent legislation have created in connec-
tion with the administration of estates.
For the same reasons exes, now take a
larger proportion of gross earnings than
they used to:

high rate of earnings and of divs. is made
possible, by the fine pile of reserves
(£3256 in excess of paid capital at June
30), from which shareholders are as
much entitled to a return as from capital
alone. On the two combined a 12 p.c.
div. calls for no more than 5.8 p.c., and
last year’s net earnings were 8.1 p.c.
When the books closed paid capital
(£90,000 in 50s. shares paid to 10s. —the
other 40s. is callable only in the event of
liquidation), the reserves and a mortgage
of £31,612 (there was nothing coming to
sundry creditors) were represented by
freeholds, etc. (£142,111), debtors for
commissions, etc. (£66,832), and cash and
public securities (£11,535). It was to help
finance erection of the new Bourke-street
premises that the board went outside.
The market notes the improvement in
the figures, the cheapness of money and
the co.’s past performances—£so,ooo of
the £90,000 of capital was transferred
from reserves, though share premiums
have since taken some of the gilt off
the gingerbread—and prices the shares
at 345. 6d. At that figure the return is a
shade under p.c. on a 12 p.c. div.
basis; the investor who looks for 4 p.c.
on his money counts on a 14 p.c. distri-
bution.
Bulolo Gold Dredging has thus far
confined deep drilling to the upper half
of the original Bulolo area, where pay-
able values have been proved to depths
varying from 60ft. to 180 ft. But a lot
more work has yet to be done before
commercial dredging depths, which will
to some extent affect recoverable values,
can be determined. Subject to this, and
with gold at 35 dollars an ounce, recover-
able values below 22ft., the originally
contemplated bottom* range from 25
cents to 40 cents a yard, or Is. to
Is. Bd. sterling. When the work in
hand is completed, drilling of the lower
half of the area, and of an extensive con-
tiguous area to the west, will be under-
taken. The co. has three dredges at
work ; their aggregate performances for
each of the last three months compare as
follows:
May. . June. July.
Treated, cub. yds. .. 707,000 688,700 634,900
Pine gold, ounces • . . 7,548 9,602 10,691
Value (Aust.) .. £64,158 £81,617 £90,873
Working profit (Aust.) 43,996 60,579 69,368
Values have been reckoned with gold at
£8 10s. per fine ounce in Australian cur-
rency. Initial difficulties in connection
with No. 3 dredge have been overcome,
and recoveries are now up to bore values.
No. 4 dredge, now complete, will set in
on the Bulowat area this month. Com-
pletion of the 4000-h.p. Baine hydro-
electric plant is scheduled for November.

Mt. Lawson Prospecting and Options
Syndicate—no connection with the Mt.
Lawson floats of a few years ago
—recently increased its capital from
£3OOO to £lO,OOO in £lO shares, of which
100 are offered at £l5 each. The
money is wanted to test a property on
the Upper Watut, and to inspect a 10-
mile dredging proposition along the
Lower Watut. Options are held over
these New Guinea properties, and pri-
vate sampling is said to disclose ground
going from Is. 9d. to 3s. 6d. a cubic yard.
**. * *
Mt. Kaindi Gold Ridges, a show which
began life in New Guinea with a flourish
of trumpets, has pulled up its socks and
announced an option over 50 acres near
Braidwood (Vic.), in the Kelly country.
The area contains a large outcrop of
gossan and slate, 60ft. wide, containing
quartz veins. The lot is expected to go
6dwt. gold to the ton, and is workable
by open-cut methods.
Palmer River Gold (N.Q.) continues to
slog away at its dredging proposition on
the famous old field. During the second
half of July 21,000 c.y. was put through
for 81oz. sdwt. gold, worth £650. This
shows an improvement in values, which
is expected to continue. The depth of
ground worked was 21ft., with a decom-
posed granite bottom.
t- * * *
If anticipations are realised, Avoca is
to be among the big gold-producers again.
It is figured that Talbot Alluvial’s
lease, which covers about seven miles of
the Bet Bet main lead, will yield at least
677,6000 z. of gold, which isn’t much
when you say it quick. With the metal at
140 s. an ounce (Australian currency) and
costs at 645. a square fathom, total
profit is put at £2,772,050. The treat-
ment plant should be ready next month.
The Madame Hopkins’s ground, which
covers at least nine miles of the same
lead, is estimated to contain “a mini-
mum” of at least 871,0000 z. of gold,
valued at £6,087,000. Here preparations
for sinking two shafts and installing
plant are in progress; full production
should be reached within two years. The
Homebush Co., which also holds about
nine miles of the Bet Bet and three
miles of two other leads, has proved
about five miles of wash, carrying gold
for a width of over 2000 ft. In the past
one of these leads yielded an average
of 36dwt. per square fathom. Three
main shafts are to be sunk, the first to
be finished in about 18 months. Tenders
have been called for a central power
plant for the three properties, in which
New Consolidated Goldfields, Oroville,
Camp Bird and Mt. Elliott are interested.
The last-named holds approximately 37
p.c. of the capital in Talbot Alluvials,
which in turn holds 40 p.c. of the issued
scrip in the Homebush and Madame
Hopkins cos.

After being worked continuously since
1861, the Rose, Thistle and Shamrock,
Harrietville (Vic.), closed down early in
1934, values having petered out. Alto-
gether it paid over £41,000 in divs. It
is now proposed to go into voluntary
liquidation, nothing worth while having
come along. At the end of October last
there was £5OOO in the till; paid capital
is £18,667. There is about 30,000 tons
of 3-4dwt. tailings, now being treated on
a royalty basis, which brought the co.
£238 to June 30. The plant was recently
sold at a figure not mentioned.
* * * *
Values in the Little 180, Bendigo,
are improving as the drive continues
south on the 593 ft. level, where the reef
is 25ft. wide. At the beginning of this
month 465 tons yielded 248J0z., an
average of 10.7dwt. as against 4.sdwt.
for stone crushed four weeks earlier.
The co. is now clear of liabilities, and
divs. are just round the corner, provided
values hold.
* *• * *
The new find at Marong, near Bendigo,
is thought to be a continuation of
the Providence line of reef, successfully
worked years ago about half a mile
further south. Where exposed, at 6ft.
from the surface, the stone is 3ft. wide,
pitches south and is covered by heavy
clay, from which prospectors have got
payable yields.
He %
At the Great Boulder meeting in
London on June 29, chairman John Wad-
dington said that, like other gold-pro-
ducers, the co. had benefited considerably
from the high price of the metal; he
rejoiced at the prospects of saving about
£48,000 a year in treatment costs when
the new mill gets into its stride, and at
the chances of a remunerative clean-up
following the dismantling of the old one.
He added that ore in sight had bulged
considerably; that the wealth in
the accumulated residues approximated
nearly two millions sterling, and that,
notwithstanding the hostility of a section
of Australian shareholders, tributors were
best left alone. A. H. Collier (director),
who concurred, argued that so long as
the management kept a sharp eye upon
tributors’ developments shareholders had
nothing to worry about.
* * * *
Western Mining Corp., which has been
a good spender on aerial and surface
prospecting and development in West-
ralia, has acquired 10 leases on the Prin-
cess Royal property, and 14 on the
Norseman-Phcenix-Viking line of lode, at
Norseman. Here activities are confined
to the Phoenix mine (the old Mararoa),
where over 100 men are employed, three
diamond drills are in operation, and the
water has been lowered to 1000 ft. This
show is expected to be put on the market
in a month or two. The Corporation
has also taken up several leases at
Kanowna, including the Lily and Main
Reef line of country.
♦ * # sfc
Good values have been found on a
new line of lode at Burbanks, south of
Coolgardie (W.A.). The reef is over
20ft. wide, between porphyry and green-
stone. At a depth of 20ft. T. Martin
and W. Trythall have taken out 80 tons,
expected to average 3oz. On the south-
ern end of the lode J. Hurley got 1490 z.
from 4cwt. of stone, and the Franks
brothers, of Wannaway fame, have also
struck a rich pocket. One man refused
£lO,OOO for his claim. Much will depend
upon the depth to which values live.
* * * *
On the recommendation of T. Leon-
ard, Westralian Gold Development has
taken an option over 144 acres at Shiel’s
Area, north of Wiluna (W.A.). About
14,000 tons of ore has been crushed
from this district for 10,000 oz. of gold,
and the lode outcrops over the full length
of the property. The option is for 12
months, with £lOO deposit, £7O lease fees
and a 3| p.c. share interest in any co.
formed to work the show.
* * * *
Edna May Amalgamated (W.A.) will
discharge its surplus mine water into a
drainage area reserved for the purpose,
having obtained permission from the
Minister for Mines to do so. Bewick,
Moreing and Co. have been appointed
general managers, C. W. Cayzer, for-
merly chief surveyor at Sons of Gwalia,
will be mine super., and George Dun-
woody, who used to look after the hydro-
electric plant at Mt. Margaret (Tas.),
mine engineer.
* * * *
At March 31 S. Kalgurli (W.A.) had
209,000 tons of 7.4dwt. ore blocked, and
76,000 tons of probable 6.4dwt. stone.
During its last term the co. treated
112,676 tons for a profit of £84,304
(sterling), and paid divs. and bonuses
totalling ss. per share, equal to 100 p.c.
# * * *
Lady Gladys (W.A.) continues to take
a fair amount of gold out of its holes in
the ground, and there is talk about a
London crowd becoming interested. So
far, the co. hasn’t shown any inclination
to push ahead with development at depth.
A few months ago a machinery call was
made ; some shareholders are wondering
why.
H* Hs * ❖
The Lancefield Co. (W.A.) is going
ahead. Most of the water has been
emptied out of the mine, the installation
of plant is well forward and production
is tipped to begin early in 1935. Pay-
able ore in sight is estimated at 300,000
tons.
* * * *
Westralia Mt. Morgans has been
handcuffed to another show and floated
in Adelaide as a good thing. Gold
production is to begin right away. At
one time the show ranked among the
best gold producers in the West, and
A. E. Morgans made a fortune out of
it. When the London co. of which he
was managing director shut down, a
local syndicate took possession, and has
pottered about the property ever since.
It is said to have done fairly well.
* * * *
According to the cables, Common-
wealth Mining and Finance, Ltd., floated
in London recently by Claude de Ber-
nales and others to carry on mining
operations on its own account, has kicked
off by, swopping £175,000 sterling for
shares in Anglo-Australian, Southern
Cross Gold Development and North Kal-
gurli United, all of which came out of
the same stable. It is one way of giving
the market a leg-up.
* * * *
Ora Banda Consols has abandoned its
option over the Melbourne United and
Queen Margaret leases at Bulong (W.A.).
To thoroughly test these properties would
mean spending a lot of money on un-
watering the mines and probably sink-
ing a new shaft.
* # * :K
The Golden West Co., an offshoot of
New Venture, has crushed 100 tons from
its mine at Kunanalling (W.A.) at the
South Kalgurli mill for an average of
14dwt. fine gold. Another parcel will be
treated shortly.

Norseman (W.A.) milled 2159 tons in
July and cyanided 1850 tons of residues
for bullion valued at £13,250 Australian
currency.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
A.A.H.: (1) They all differ slightly. (2) Yes.
(3) Yes, but vestibule transactions are not re-
corded unless parties agree to book the business.
... .V.H: The market is not quite certain what
the strike might lead to, if anything. It is a
sound concern, and figures at June 30 last
promise to be better than the 1933 ones....
J.M.: (1) Fair prospects. (2) and (3) Sit tight;
both promise we11....N0. 2421: If safety of
capital is important, look elsewhere J.E.N.:
The C. and G. and Commonwealth Life
merged their interests in Commonwealth Life
(Amalgamated). See B. 3/1 / ’34 M.A.S.:
Nos. 5,6, 7 and 1 are investments, 2,8, 9, 10,
4 and 3 are specs, in the order stated
J.8.M.: No record... .C.S.H.: (1) All right so
long as opposition keeps out of the way. (2)
and (4) Good specs. (3) Doubtful Anxious:
Bonus shares are taxable, and should be in-
cluded in income-tax return of allottee....
F.X.L.: H01d... .A.D.8.: Looks blue....
H.D.: If properly handled it may develop into
small dividend-payer... .Pro Bono Publico:
(1) The management is right, but the co.’s
contract with the Government runs out next
month; much depends upon its renewal and
the terms. (2) Sound lock-up scrip, though it
may be a year or so before ords. get back
into picture. (3) The future of copra is the
problem. Subject to that they look like a
good buy.

“Viva Villa”
The director of this one at the St.
James was faced with the task of making
a likeable character out of about the most
callous ruffian of modern times. He
has done it, though Wallace Beery, as
Villa, condemns an enemy to be eaten
alive by ants and is revealed perpetrat-
ing other barbarities. We are shown
some of the excuses for Beery’s sadistic
behavior. An oppressed peasantry. His
father being flogged to death at the order
of an alien tyrant. His early manhood
as a fugitive patriot. The sentimental
motive is supplied by H. B. Walthall as
Madero. There is no historical evidence
that Villa gave a hoot for Madero, but
here the bandit’s adoration for his Presi-
dent resembles that of a dog’ for its
master.
Given the premises (which, by the
way, are not claimed to be correct
by those responsible for the film) and
the story is satisfying enough. Beery
gives a magnificent study of a vainglori-
ous, illiterate barbarian with muddled
aspirations after higher things. The ori-
ginal of the character was the burglar
who departed tearfully, leaving the
family silver behind, after an interview
with an innocent child, and Beery is not
all criminal; he has an edifying dash of
Robin Hood. In dramatic contrast with
Beery’s sweating, roaring violence is the
tight-lipped reserve of his natty little
idol; and for comic relief there are
Stuart Erwin, a reporter who goes raiding
and murdering with the bandits, and Leo
Carrillo, who when not fighting admires
himself in looking-glasses.
The immense crowds are handled with
great skill, and the battle pieces are as
realistic as any that have been put on
a screen.
“Manhattan Melodrama”
Clark Gable and William Powell are
boyhood friends. Clark grows up to be
a boss gambler, a swell guy and a bril-
liant figure in the night life of New
York. William becomes a district
attorney bulging with high principles.
Clark takes life with insouciance, and
other people’s lives with pleasing skill,
and when Myrna Loy crosses his path
he allies himself to her without benefit
of clergy. Then Myrna falls into Wil-
liam’s arms by accident and in a taxi-
cab, and is offered matrimony and a
career of dazzling social eminence. It
takes her no time to make up her mind.
Will is on the eve of being elected
Governor of the State when he is faced
with the problem of sending Clark to
the chair or being unfaithful to his public
responsibilities. He chooses the former
course, only to discover that Clark’s
latest murder was committed to help his
friend, and that he has maintained his
principles only to lose the affections of
Miss Loy. He goes to Sing Sing and
tries to induce Clark to accept a reprieve,
but Clark opts nobly for the hot seat.
William then makes public confession of
his infidelity, resigns the Governorship
and steps out into the world to make his
life anew. As he walks from the legis-
lative halls he finds Miss Loy waiting for
him, her faith restored. They are re-
united as messengers bring the news that
the Legislature has rejected his resigna-
tion. The Metro, Melbourne, is the
scene of this elevating work.
“Princess Charming”
In this British picture, at Melb. May-
fair, the R.N. is enlisted to make an
amusing romance on “Prisoner of
Zenda” lines. A marriage of convenience
has been arranged between the King of
Aufland (George Grossmith) and Prin-
cess Evelyn Laye, whose kingdom has
been seized by a dictator. She escapes
the revolutionaries by espousing Captain
Laund (Harry Wilcoxon) who looks sus-
piciously like a commander in the R.N.
The monosyllabic seadog refuses to
hand her over to the king, and when it
comes to the point bolts with her in an
aeroplane. There was urgent need of a
reducer, as in so many British films, but
the thing has plenty of bright moments,
and Miss Laye looks beautiful.
“Beloved”
At the Liberty. It begins before the
American Civil War with John Boles as
a rising young Southern violinist. We
follow his progress from a back room to
a gorgeous apartment in which he rests
after his concerts. Then
we find him back in the shabby room,
haying abandoned concert work as a
point of principle.
A drunken son appears, and he is fol-
lowed by a musical grandson. The
grandson unconsciously plagiarises his
grandfather’s melodies, and becomes
famous and rich. The happy ending
arrives when the grandson persuades a
concert company to play Boles’s great
symphony.
Richard Carle is amusing as a concert
promoter who believes that you can kid
the public all the time.
“The Old ’Bus”
This is an account of Australia’s
achievements in the air, with particular
reference to those of Kingsford Smith
“VIVA VILLA,” AT SYDNEY ST. JAMES.

and his colleagues in the Southern
Cross. The story goes back to Har-
grave, who, in 1894, demonstrated that
four kites attached to a rope would lift
a man. Glimpses are provided of the
first flights in Sydney of Houdini, W. E.
Hart, Guillaux, Marduel and the Rich-
ardson brothers in flickering, cloudy
shots rescued from old news-gazettes.
The exploits of Knabenshue, Bleriot,
Guynemeyer and other early European
aviators are also touched on. The Aus-
tralians Ross and Keith Smith, Parer and
Mclntosh, and Bert Hinkler are all seen
before Kingsford Smith appears. A good
deal of this part of the picture consists
of scenes of cities and stopping-places on
the London to Australia air-route, and
there are some absorbing shots of the
north and interior of Australia.
“Heat Lightning”
We see a day and night at a desert
car-service station. The station is kept
by sisters, Aline MacMahon and Ann
Dvorak. Miss MacMahon’s performance
sticks in the memory. Facially she is
the Mona Lisa come to life. The story
is an average talkie blend of crooks,
divorcees and Mexicans, but Miss Mac-
Mahon gives it life and naturalness. She
talks little and seems to act not at all. The
many subsidiary characters —almost all
wayfarers—pitch their characterisations
in the same key, so that what the adver-
tising represents as a melodrama of the
most pungent sort achieves a very much
higher niche. Sydney Capitol’s current
programme is the gainer.
“She Learned About Sailors”
Alice Faye, who croons, and who is, of
course, a cabaret-singer so that she can
prove it, falls in love with Lew Ayres,
who, with other knockabout comedians,
has a job on a U.S.A. battleship. The
crew spend their time knocking one
another down, falling down hatchways
and meddling in one another’s love
affairs. When Mr. Ayres writes to Miss
Faye stating that it wouldn’t be fair to
marry her on a sailor’s pay his asso-
ciates become rabidly sentimental and
neglect to post the letter. Later they
engineer an Ayres-Faye marriage by re-
presenting to each party that the other
will be gaoled if they don’t marry. The
brightest spot in the fantasia is a rough-
and-tumble in which Harry Green jiu-
jitsus three of the lads in pork-pie hats.
Sundry Shows.
When eminent singers have visited
Australia in the past it has often been
possible for some cosmopolitan in the
audience to temper enthusiasm by
remarking, “Ah, but you should
have heard her in her prime!”
Florence Austral, who received the
usual hearty Sydney welcome from a
big audience at the Town Hall on
Saturday, stands in no fear of that sort
of compliment. She is, if not in her
prime, not yet in it, for her voice is a
much more expressive instrument than
it was when she was last heard in these
parts, and obviously she is surer of her
business. She has achieved smooth-
ness over the whole of an extensive range
of scale. On Saturday night she soared
to the B flat above the stave in the prayer
from “La Forza del Destino” with no
visible effort, and negotiated the lower
notes of “The Erl King” so comfortably
that it would be difficult to say in what
part of the scale her best texture lies.
The programme was selected to dis-
play virtuosity—four songs of Schubert,
a good deal of Richard Strauss, Rach-
maninoff’s “Spring Waters,” Malashkin’s
“If I Could Express in Song,” Bantock’s
“Yung Yang,” and a burst of Wagnerian
drama —Brunnhilde’s battle-cry. Of all
these “The Erl King,” perhaps because it
is most familiar, seemed to evoke the
greatest enthusiasm, though “The Youth
at the Spring,” in very much more placid
vein, ran it close in popularity.
Flautist Amadio, who makes his pipe
carol as freely as a bird, was heard in
Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Ravel and
Rimsky-Korsakov. The Russian’s “Song
of India” proved ideal for the instru-
ment. Raymond Lambert, in addition
to displaying his talents as an accom-
pianist, gave a fine performance of
Beethoven’s Sonata, Op. 78, with a
Chopin nocturne and the Allegro de Con-
cert of Granados as sweets.

The ladies in the entourage of Carter
the Great, who opened at Sydney Cri.
on Saturday night, share the violent
doom of the martyrs in the hymn, being
frequently “torn asunder, slain with
sword”; but, since these things befall
them merely in a Pickwickian sense, as
it were, they are able to keep smiling.
Carter is a good showman. His air is
a trifle aloof and indifferent, as if the
marvels he performs were but the relaxa-
tions of a savant. He speaks learnedly
of the Einstein theory and of the
latest developments in surgery, and smiles
indulgently when the applause that greets
some sensational feat breaks in upon his
lecture. Illusion follows illusion with
rapidity and precision, and some tricks
that are not new are given a new setting,
a new form and a new approach. Perhaps
the most effective illusion is that at the
end of the first part, in which a girl ; s
extracted from a box that has been folded
into tiny compass, but they are all in-
teresting. The “telepathic” demonstration
is very smartly managed.

Shaw’s “Man and Superman,” which
was produced by Gregan McMahon at
the old Athenaeum at Melbourne in 1912,
reappeared under the same generalship at
the Garrick on Saturday before a full and
enthusiastic house. The latest presen-
tation was remarkable for brilliant cast-
ing, an art at which the veteran pro-
ducer becomes ever more adept. A
better Anne Whitfield could hardly be
imagined than Marie Balfour, whose
combination of exterior innocence and
inward guile was the result of hard
study plus appropriate natural gifts.
Phoebe Marks was an admirably emo-
tional Mrs. Whitfield, and Eileen Ragg
made a brief but dazzling appearance as
that pillar of British morality Miss
Ramsden. Ruth Conabere’s Violet
Robinson was solid and sincere; and
Collins Hilton’s obsessed poet, Frank
Desbrowe’s Roebuck Ramsden, Norman
Blackler’s Cockney chauffeur, Paul
O’Loughlin’s Hector Malone and H. M.
Gregory’s American millionaire fitted into
the picture without showing any joins.
McMahon’s acting was a well-nigh
perfect vehicle for the heterodox opinions
of John Tanner Bernard Shaw, and if
the make-up had included the familiar
beard it would not have seemed out of
place. Many lines were forgotten on
Saturday night, but the audience waited
indulgently, for it was deeply interested.


THE OFFICE FLAPPER GOES CRUISING AND TAKES HER CAMERA.


ABORINGINALITIES
“Bill O’C.”: Apropos the pup that was
recognised because “he barked like his
father” (B. 25/7/’34), heredity manifests
itself in unexpected ways. In the old
pioneering days an uncle had two men
working on his run —one a weedy Cock-
ney, the other a hefty, red-headed York-
shireman with an impediment in his
speech. Also employed was an attractive
damsel, to whom both men paid court.
Each left about the same time, and pro-
bably for the same reason, but the girl
stayed on. A few years later uncle ran
across the Cockney, who, in embarrassed
fashion, led up to a delicate subject: The
girl—was she still at the station? He’d
heard she had made a start with an un-
orthodox family of her own shortly after
he left; did the kid —er —resemble him
at all? “No,” roared his bluff old boss ;
“he’s the dead spit of old Yorkie, red
hair and all.” Then, as Cockayne seemed
still incredulous, he added the clincher:
“And he stutters like him, too.”
❖ * ❖ *
“W.P.T.”: Monaro Mick carried a
billycan that was always as bright and
shiny as a new pin. It had everyone
“Come on, now —tell me where you were lust night!”
“Aw, go and lay an egg!”
puzzled; but when I came upon his
camp suddenly one afternoon as he was
preparing his evening meal 1 discovered
the secret. The billycan was never placed
on the fire. He boiled the water for his
tea in a stiff brown-paper bag, and then
poured it into the billycan. It’s easy
to boil water in a paper bag.
“Felis”: The Brisbane end of the
R.S.P.C.A. is complaining bitterly that
there are 10,000 homeless, unwanted cats
in Brisbane. Melbourne has the same
problem, which, owing to the notorious
homing propensities of the breed, cannot
be solved by deportation. My advice,
taken from a long-forgotten volume of
American humor by Max Adeler, is to
grow a grape-vine. In the story a small
American community is plagued with un-
wanted cats. A leading citizen, unable to
sleep by reason of the nightly caterwaul-
ing, discovers that as fertilisers for his
grape-vines defunct cats are unequalled.
Thus, gradually, the community is freed
from the plague, and, though many cat-
addicts mourn the unaccountable dis-
appearance of their pets, the experi-
menter’s grapes are accounted the finest
in the countryside.
“Crotalus”: Queensland
herpetologists are interested
in a statement by H. A.
Longman, of Queensland
Museum, that the very ven-
omous and savage “southern
tiger” exists in the border
scrubs and in some localities
nearer Brisbane. Two recog-
nised varieties of tiger-snake
are known in the State, but
neither approaches the notori-
ous southerner as a killer.
This snake would be the
most dangerous in Australia
but for the fortunate fact
that he belongs to the colu-
brines, which have short
poison fangs with an open
groove down the curved
front —the poison is often
partially absorbed when
clothing is bitten through.
Had the tiger the long,
viperine fang of the death
adder, with its internal tube
for carrying the poison into
the wound, the stumpy ser-
pent with the spine on his
tail would be running him a
poor second as a killer. The Eliza Hall
Institute in Melbourne, which has long
been experimenting with snake venoms,
classes that of the tiger as the most toxic
in the world.
“Kultur”: There is something to be
said for both sides to that argument
about whether or not wild turkeys acquire
appendicitis through eating wire-legged
grasshoppers. For instance, the cases
quoted as occurring in Centralia (B.
18/7/’34) may have been due to the un-
couth table manners one would expect
from fowls inhabiting those savage
wastes. On the other hand, the Queens-
land birds referred to by “Pauw” (B.
25/7/’34) as suffering no ill-effects save
repletion from a grasshopper diet were
probably careful at meal times. Such
was the case on the upper Barcoo in
my youth. There a turkey has been
distinctly seen to take the grasshopper in
one claw after catching it and to pull
all the legs off with its bill, standing the
while on the other leg. Further inves-
tigation showed that the bird was
accompanied on its stately walk through
the grass by hordes of ants. These
“sprung” the grasshoppers right under
the turkey’s bill and were rewarded
with the legs. As every student of
entomology knows, any ant will leave
“Ladies and genelmen, y'll ’ave to excuse the villain fer not gnashin’ his teeth,
’cause he fergot t’ fetch ’em.”
home and mother for a grasshopper’s
leg, so the partnership must have been
satisfactory to both parties.
* * * *
“Yarri”: The nucleus of inland town-
ships is generally a wayside pub. Roma
(Q.), now a fairly big and important
place, with hopes of being an oil city,
had three hotels before it had a private
house.
“Petrel”: Surprising to read (B.
1 / 8/’34) that Maoriland ornithologists are
wondering how a shearwater came
to be cast up on the Shivery Isles,
“birds' of the kind never having
been seen there before.” The
observers must have had the tele-
scope to the blind eye. Shear-
waters, a numerous family, are
distributed all over the oceans of
the globe from the Arctic to the
Antarctic circles. They get their
name from their ceaseless habit of
weaving to and fro close to the
surface, a habit which has caused
French sailors to dub them ames
damnees, the aimless wandering
suggesting that of lost souls. There
are many varieties, and possibly
the M.L. specimen was one seldom
seen so far south. Like all the
petrels, the shearwater never comes
ashore save to nest, and this would
help to make identification diffi-
cult ; though the mutton-bird, him-
self a shearwater, is a prime M.L.
delicacy.
“Salvo”: Down around Albany (W.A.)
way fishermen have been cursing for
years about the damage done to nets by
schools of what they knew as “albacore.”
Now that the albacore have been defi-
nitely identified as tunny, Westralian
anglers are smiling and getting their gear
ready for trips down south. The tunny
usually come into King George’s Sound
about Easter and remain for upwards of
three months. They travel in schools of
about a dozen, and the average weight is
estimated at something like 120 pounds.
“Bucerotida”: Sydney Zoo is mourn-
ing the loss of a rare hornbill which was
voyaging from Sumatra with three com-
panions. They were in a bamboo cage,
and bamboo is not easily severed even by
a steel saw. This enterprising fowl got
busy with his huge toothed bill and cut
a way out, to make for home and mother
again. His friends, with less Dillinger in
them, failed to follow, and now adorn
Taronga. The hornbill is the master-
woodcutter —even the gang-gang and
other cockatoos which bite pieces out of
steel-hard gum-trees while searching for
grubs take second place. Also he has
been a great moral influence ; legend says
he influenced the Hindu idea of the
purdah for women, later copied by Mos-
lems. Locating a hollow tree, Mr. Horn-
bill drives a crosscut into the trunk until
the shaft is cut. Mrs. H. then enters and
begins to lay. Husband takes no
chances. He walls the entrance up with
thick clay until, escape is impossible, and
there the missus stays until the chicks
are hatched and grown up. The family
is fed by papa through a small hole left
in the clay barrier, which he breaks
down when the time to emerge has come.
In Papua, where edible birds and beasts
are often rare, the usually plentiful horn-
bill is in great favor for soup. The
bird’s flesh is black and repellent, but
the soup is a rich brown brew much re-
sembling that from the hare, and many
a washed-out fever-convalescent has
mopped it up gratefully.
“Metoo”: After a hectic career in and
around Dongarra, near Geraldton
(W.A.), a dingo with £25 on his head
made an easy target at 30 yards’ range
the other day. Local pastoralists reck-
oned he accounted for 674 sheep in three
months. They,identified him by a miss-
ing toe which showed up in his tracks.
For a long time the hunted one was too
shrewd for capture. But he ventured too
close to a settler’s home and was potted
from a bedroom window.
“Kapiti”: Maoriland naturalists are
worrying over the increasing destruction
of sea-birds by waste oil from oil-
driven craft. Recently hundreds of
birds of various sorts have been picked
up on the Manawatu beaches dead or
dying, their feathers all glued together
by the viscid oil waste. There have been
cases of the kind in Australian harbors
where oil has been allowed to leak out
against the regulations. At sea the
trouble does not seem to be general, and
this may be due to the much warmer
temperature of the coastal waters on this
side, which would be a help to the break-
ing up of the oil film. In the cold M.L.
seas the films would be thicker and
heavier, and would take much longer to
dissipate.
“J.H.F.”: I"m not looking for a tilt
with “Cachalot” (B. 25/7/’34) over the
question of whether whales spout con-
gealed air or water —a mixture of both is
probably near the mark—but I’m ready
to swear that they do bellow. In a fight
one round of which took place within
60 feet from where I stood on the deck
the bellowing was as loud and clear as a
lion’s roar, and could be heard as far.
“Cachalot” says “whales have no vocal
organs.” I’m not on intimate terms with
them, so I don’t know. But, even if they
haven’t, I would ask “Cachalot” what
vocal organs are brought into play in the
trombonic blowing of his own nose.
AT NYNGAN WHEN IT RAINS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We talked to him of Paris,
Of San Francisco’s charms,
Of Buda-Pesth and China,
Of Manitoba’s farms,
Of Colorado’s canyons
And wild Potosi’s plains . . .
He said, “You come to Nyngan
And watch it when it rains!
“The world’s awash with water,
So in the pubs all day
We greet the happy farmers
Who come to town to stay;
For why should fellows travel
, And tire their eyes and brains,
When they can stay at Nyngan
And watch it when it rains?
“The noisy maggics chatter,
The crows for ‘Fa-a-ther’ cry,
The kookaburra’s laughter
Would make'a wet pup dry.
The cows and calves go crazy,
The sheep-dogs break their chains,
And nothing’s slow or lazy
At Nyngan when it rains.”
We told him of Balbao
And Monte Video’s views,
Of Calais and Callao
And great white ships that cruise.
He said, “My hack goes balmy;
He backs and breaks his reins.
You oughter come to Nyngan
And watch him when it rains!”

“Airline”: Have never used a kite or
cobwebs to catch fish (B. 27/6/’34); for
a wild night’s entertainment give me an
eel-“bobbing” expedition. It is a sport
widely practised in Maoriland. The
“bob” consists of a bunch of glow-worms
threaded on to a length of flax fibre. A
stout rod is employed, and when the
wrigglers start to bite the fun begins.
There’s a sad lack of technique about the
business—simply one mighty heave to
throw the victim as far from his native
element as possible. Mistakes are bound
to happen, and many a slimy projectile
finds a hapless human mark in the dark-
ness.

“Brace-and-bit”: “Pack Saddle” needs
to correct both his history and his geo-
graphy when describing how Chinks
slipped through to the Cloncurry fields
(B. 18/7/’34). Nararni Creek is not on
Lake Nash. Nowrani, the watercourse
to which he is trying to refer, is on Rock-
lands—or used to be before that country
was resumed. The Chinese didn’t make
down as low as Lake Nash. There’s a
story that a Territory man acted as
Chinese smuggler into Queensland. The
Chows used to come to him from Darwin
with letters of introduction. He would
get three months’ labor out of them and
shoot them up Gidyea Creek to the Clon-
curry Ranges. He would hand them a
quantity of rations, see them over the
border between the Territory and Q., give
them his blessing and bid ’em good-bye.

“Cam Cove”: “Uncle Ben’s” recom-
mendation (B. 27 /6 / ’34) of how to wring
a crow’s neck may very easily be suc-
cessful—strange things do happen. Hugh
McCrae tells the story of how David Mc-
Kee Wright lost a favorite sunflower in
a similar way. David took a candle out
one night to see how his sunflower was

getting on. Suddenly the bloom dropped
to the ground, severed from its stalk.
David, unconsciously, had been walking
around the plant, and the giant flower,
following the candle light, had wrung its
own neck.
* * * *
“Bam”: Re the snake that fitted the
hole (B. 13/6/’34). A snake pursued on
a property near Mt. Gambier (S.A.) soon
got into difficulties. He may have fitted
his hole when he came out, but he most
certainly didn’t when he tried to re-enter
it. He was killed, and his slayer dis-
covered that the obstruction in the rep-
tile’s middle was a stumpy-tail lizard,
intact.
“Tom Willie”: Yes, I know that the
more truthful people of the time did
ascribe a different perform-
ance to the tucker-box dog (B.
18/7/’34), yet we haven’t
located the position of the
strange act. Has Gundagai
been moved, has four miles
been saved by the new road,
or is the apologetic monument
in the wrong place? The story
told of the animal was at first
a bushman’s camp yarn. It
afterwards got into two bal-
lads: one by Jack Moses, the
other by “Jim Grahame.” The
latter was intended by his
proud parents to be James
Gordon, but Henry Lawson
gave him the Scotch handle
for use in The Bulletin, and
he is more Jim Grahame now
than he ever was Jim Gordon. And,
while I’m at it, who wrote the first ot’
the ballads, Jack or Jim?

“Sand G.”: I’ve found the crushed
leaves of the dock-weed to bring almost
instantaneous relief when rubbed on the
stings of a gympie (B. 18/7/’34).
Strangely enough, the weed is nearly
always found near the gympie-gympie
trees, and is easily identified by its
narrow curled leaves on a pink stalk.
“De M.”: Gympie isn’t as dangerous
as the milky mangrove, which grows
from N.S.W. to North Aus. A drop
of sap in the eye will cause blind-
ness. You can’t gather even a cupful
of the fluid without being affected by a
burning sensation in the throat, sore
eyes and a headache. Abos. and New
Guinea natives use the juice to “cure”
leprosy, and in Fiji the patient is'fumi-
gated with the smoke of the burning
wood.

“Wagga”: Where do some writers
glean their information? In Hendrik van
Loon’s “The Home of Mankind” it is
asserted that Australia was not seen
by European eyes till 1642, and that its
aboriginal inhabitants, of intelligence on
a level with the ape, did know something
of the boomerang (“a clumsy weapon”),
but hadn’t enough brains to devise spears.

“C.L.8.”: I can guarantee “Felis” (B.
18/7/’34) a good hearty meal. Tiger-
cats on the Comboyne (N.S.W.) grow to
about 501 b. weight and are marsupial.
They are tree-dwellers, and will fill the
hollow of their home with bones and the
like until the thing becomes uninhabit-
able. A specimen was caught here a few
days ago, but how to forward it to “Felis”
is the question. When cornered these cats
arch their backs and give out a snarling
hiss that will stop “Felis” or any of his
tribe from approaching unless properly
armed. I have seen six kittens, the size
and shape of the Canadian-wonder bean,
neither legs nor tail properly formed,
firmly attached to their respective six
teats in the pouch of this animal.
“Molrolonga”: Gippsland Ranges
abound in wild cats, most of them the
descendants of Chinese diggers’ cats of
two generations ago. I snared and shot
a tomcat having particularly well-defined
“Blime, the bloke ’e falls on is goin' to get ’ urt!”
black “tiger” markings. His overall
length was 3ft. 4+in., and his skin was
as large as any wallaby hide I’ve seen.

“Bally”: “Lancewood” (B. 11/7/’34)
doesn’t accept without argument the way
my mate detected a bushman. Very well:
try this one and never know
a miss at picking an old-time
or present horseman. By
means fair or foul, get the
suspect to pick up something
from the floor—anything at
any level with his feet. Take
note of how he bends. The
horseman, swaying in the
saddle all day, gains a
suppleness about the loins
which no other form of work
will give. When he picks up
that matchbox he swings
from the loins, and his knees
don’t bend more than is
necessary. Most of ’em will
only bend one knee and
swing the other leg straight
out behind as they stoop.
The other fellow hasn’t that
suppleness of the loins; he
bends his knees, sways slight-
ly at the loins and squats like
a frog as he goes down to
pick up the change which
spilled from the counter.

“E. 8.”: You needn’t go to
the islands to find places
where bunny won’t multiply.
Travelling through part of
the Gascoyne in Westralia,
we noticed no traces of rab-
bits. Inquiry elicited the
reason —the country was so
infested with ants that young
rabbits were eaten by them
as soon as born. When
camping in this country
it is necessary, if any rest
is hoped for, to place wood ashes round
the bunks. Ants don’t like walking in
ashes.
“Wagga”: Met an outsize in horse-
shoes the other day. It was picked up
in an old hotel yard in Portland (Vic.),
and, rusted and worn, with broken nails
in it, still weighed 4|-lb. The shoe was
about eight inches in length, the iron at
the heel being a couple of inches across,
and correspondingly heavy. I don’t
know what sort of a draught horse wore
it originally, but it must have been some-
thing pretty hefty.

“King T.”: The feathers of the owl
are supposed to be designed so as to
enable it to fly with such muffled flight
that it can surprise its quarry lurking in
the grass. I think, however, that the
silence of the owl’s flight is to enable
itself to hear, rather than to prevent
others from hearing it. In its hunting
the owl is dependent upon the minutest
sound for guidance, and it would be
impossible for it to hear anything un-
less its flight were noiseless. It often
turns in flight round some obstacle
obstructing its vision, then suddenly
pounces—guided, apparently, by a sound
so slight that human ears couldn’t detect
it. Such keen hearing would be useless
unless supplemented by noiseless flight.

“Kali”: Any Aboliar explain the idio-
syncrasy of my spider weather-prophet?
A handsome hairy-legs, about dusk he
builds along the verandah-rail in accord-
ance with the approaching weather, using
the posts, window-boxes and geraniums
as stays. Next morning all that remains
of the job is the dozen or so radiating
main strands ; the circular architecture is
entirely missing. Does he wind in these
strands each morning?
* * * *
“W.P.T.”: The thirsty traveller in the
western parts of N.S.W. and Queensland
welcomes the sight of a native nectarine
(Owenia acidula ) almost as much as a
fresh-water spring. The fruit is a great
thirst-quencher. It is about the size of
a small nectarine, and has a somewhat
similar, though very acid, flavor. The
abos. knew it as gruie; it is one of the
prettiest trees to be found in this coun-
try, and is a standby for stock in times
of drought.
“Fancar”: Apropos of “C.M.B.’s”
mention of Irish farmers running a goat
with their dairy herd “for luck” (B.
11/7/’34), I’ve seen cow-cockies run a
goat with their milkers as a charm against
red-water. One at least swears by it.
:<c * * *
“Mac Binghi”: That caterpillar-cum-
fungus mentioned as a Maoriland wonder
is common on the N.S.W. North Coast,
two varieties having been unearthed. The
spore of the fungus settles on the body of
the living caterpillar, which, having
grown to full size, burrows into the earth
and calls it a day. The fungus then
begins to absorb the juices of the grub,
and fills the skin with its own growth.
When the toadstool is dug up it is hard to
tell where plant begins and grub ends, the
caterpillar having become virtually the
fungus root, while retaining its own
form with head and legs complete.
THE QUID TEST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You, may think there isn’t much about him that
you wouldn’t know;
You’re persuaded you can read him like a book,
but even so
You will get another outlook, • though you've
known him from a kid,
When he tells a hard-luck story—and then
nips you for a quid.
You will find, I rather fancy, as so many more
have done,
That his mem’ry has blank spaces and your
quid has dropped in one.
It may dawn on you, like others, that the chap
you used to greet
Puts himself to endless trouble to avoid you
in the street.
1 here’s a lot in the transaction, simple as it
seems to be;
And I think it pretty certain there are many
who'll agree
In a most emphatic manner that a fellow lifts
the lid
On a lot of human nature when he “lends”
a man a quid.

ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
SHED EFFICIENCY.
“Murrawong”: It is only natural that
every grazier should want his shearing
carried out as cheaply as possible, but it
is a mistake to sacrifice the preparation
of the clip for the sake of saving a few
shillings in wages.
Years ago, it was the custom to instal
shearing-machines in multiples of four.
Sheds might have 8, 12, 16, 36 stands,
but nowadays the big sheds are dis-
appearing, and in their place are
smaller sheds fitted for any number
between three and eight stands. It is
when a team of shed-hands has to be
arranged for an odd number of shearers
that the cheeseparing begins. The
general idea is to engage the recognised
number of shed-hands for, say, four
shearers and then to put on five or six
shearers with that team.
Certain woolsheds, on account of their
construction, require more rouseabouts
than others for a similar number of
stands, but the old idea of 8, 12 or 20
shearers was based on the fact that the
minimum number of shed-hands could
attend to four shearers. One boy can
pick up fleeces for four men. One piece-
picker can cope with the output from
four shearers, and so can one wool-
roller. For an eight-stand shed, two of
each are needed.
In sheds of five, six and seven stands,
the trouble begins. One active boy can
pick up for five men when the tables are
handy to the board. For six men he has
got to be exceptionally smart, especially
in some L sheds, and it" the team is a
fast one there will be fleeces and locks
from one end of the board to the wool-
table, and a boy knocked up and dis-
spirited before the end of the day. He
cannot be expected to pick up and throw
out the fleeces properly, sweep the board,
tar and take the stains out of the wether
bellies. Something must suffer, especially
when five or six shearers finish their
sheep together.
One good piece-picker may be able
to handle the skirtings from five shearers,
but where he has to pick for six or
seven he either dumps the wool half-
picked or gets hopelessly bogged behind
a mountain of skirtings.
ANTHRAX PRECAUTIONS.
“Beefo”: Twice within three months
anthrax has occurred in N.S.W. and
Queensland.
Treatment is waste of time. Symptoms
are scarcely noticeable before the affected
animal lies dead. Burning of carcass is
too dangerous, and careless burying
makes it certain the spores will infect
pastures. Bury at least 6ft. deep
without cutting the hide. Keep a good
fire going above the grave for a
couple of days and then fence the spot
in. No stock should be allowed to graze
in the same paddock for at least 12
months, and even then there’s a danger.
A recent case in N.S.W. proved that.
DIPPING FOR FLY.
“St.- Andrews”: Tell “Crutchem” (B.
25/7/’34) that I was not lucky in getting
good fly-prevention results from dipping.
“Crutchem” says that he would never
dip for fly because the sheep always get
“knocked about.” I suggest that
“Crutchem’s” dip is obsolete and that
his men are rough.
He says that his sheep were struck
four days after dipping. That fact proves
that they were put through too fast and
did not absorb the dip, or that the mix-
ture was too weak or improperly pre-
pared.
I have dipped three-quarter-woolled
ewes a month from lambing and not
too flash in condition, and never lost
one. They had 90 p.c. of lambs, so they
were not much the worse for dipping.
I ran a public dip for more than 30
years, and have used all kinds of dips,
both liquid and powder. If “Crutchem”
puts in an up-to-date “walk in, walk out”
bath he will never have to complain
about his sheep being knocked about.
I have never seen properly crutched
sheep blown after being jetted or
swabbed unless they were very wrinkly
and always wet, and 1 always culled
“wrinkly britches” —better a pound less
wool than a dead sheep. A word of
warning, however. Many “walk in, walk
out” bath plans that I have seen are
wrong in principle, but I shall be glad to
help anyone who wants details.
LAMB-HANDLING METHODS.
“Spring”: Care in handling sucker
lambs must begin at birth.
A lamb should never be held by the
legs. This is one of the main causes of
swollen joints, which ruin the carcass
for first grade. Pick them up by slipping
the arm underneath the brisket, ,
Grabbing them by the wool or poking
them with sticks bruises the meat and
causes abcesses. When yarding and
drafting don’t allow them to be forced
through gates, and watch the dog. He
often works too hard with lambs.
At trucking-time get exemption (if you
can) from branding, which bruises the
lamb and reduces his value in the market.
Lambs thus carefully treated will soon
prove their added value by the higher
returns when sold.
PREVENTION OF BLACK DISEASE.
“Lion”: Prevention is easier than cure,
and, as the disease can only be present
in conjunction with fluke, get rid of the
fluke in animals for a start by drench-
ing with carbon tetrachloride. Then
clean the country. Drain all swamps and
all stagnant pools if possible; if not,
treat.with bluestone in small bags. Any
water in which the fresh-water snail
lives should also be treated. The snail
is essential to the life cycle of the fluke.
Fluky properties are always a poten-
tial source of danger to the sheep, and,
should an outbreak of it occur near by,
the owner who has rigidly guarded
against fluke will probably escape serious
losses.
Consider the money spent on blue-
stone and labor a definite improvement
to your property. It will repay you most
handsomely.
FUMIGATION V. BAITS.
“Rich. J.”: “Valerin’s” way with rab-
bits (B. 25/7/’34) may be effective, but
his elaborate method of preparing the
baits calls for much labor combined with
a chemist’s judgment.
Fumigation is by far the best way of
keeping bunny down, and carbon bi-
sulphide and cyanogas stand out alone
for the job.
Carbon, however, though very potent
in experienced hands, is dangerous and
not so effective when used by a new-
chum. Heavier than air, it affects the
lower holes in the warren, leaving the
occupants in the high portions unscathed.
Cyanogas (calcium cyanide) is a dust,
and is best applied with a blower.
When fumigating, the first essential is
to see that gates and fences are in per-
fect order. If they are not, all fumiga-
tion is useless.
Kill, time and cost have to be con-
sidered when judging results. David
Stead, a former Rabbit Menace Com-
missioner for N. S. Wales, instances a
case where 8000 acres was cleared by
digging, trapping and liquid fumigation
at a cost of 4s. 6d. an acre for labor
alone. With cyanogas he cleared a
similar area for an inclusive cost of 9d.
per acre.
Cyanogas is particularly useful in
rocky and heavily timbered country
where rabbits are difficult to dig out. It
will float into the furthermost recesses
of the warren.
I once completely cleared 250 acres,
heavily infested, in four days at a cost,
excluding labor, of £4. And this included
a blower costing 555.
CHOOSING POTATO SEED.
“W.D.Mc.”: “R.J.” (B. 25/7/’34), who
says that now is the time to select your
seed potatoes, is wrong. The only time is
while they are being dug. Once in the
bag the best expert in the land cannot say
for certain whether they are prolific or
duds. When I am digging and come on
a good root with a large number of good-
shaped, marketable tubers, true to type,
I put them on one side. When I have
sufficient to produce enough seed for
annual requirements, I plant them in a
stud plot and thus grow my own seed.
Like produces like in the plant world
as well as the animal, and you will find
stalks with only one or two beautiful
tubers. If you plant them, they will re-
produce one or two instead of a dozen or
more. The grower who starts with first-
cJass seed, true to name and type and
selected at digging-time, will never need
to go outside to get fresh seed unless he
desires to change the variety.
If the land is good, you can, if you
wish, produce two crops from the same
piece of ground in the year. 1 planted
Carmine No. 1 at the end of July and
will dig them at Christmas, and then
replant with Snowflake, which will be
ready in the autumn.
Manure well with super, and sulphate
of ammonia at the rate of 6 to 1 and you
will get a good crop from each planting.
The more you work between the rows
the better the crop, and the higher you
mould them up the greater the protection
from grubs.
CORRECTING THE BALANCE.
“Jass”: It is one thing to find that
deficiency of specific minerals (“Rich.
J.,” B. 25/7/’34), but another to correct
it with a lick.
“Rich. J.” mentions sulphur. Every
sheepman knows that wool contains Jt
and therefore sheep must obtain a regu-
lar supply. What few know is that sheep
cannot apply powdered sulphur to their
needs. Every atom of the sulphur in
wool comes from the proteins forming
part of the sheep’s diet. To use sulphur
in a lick is quite futile.
The same applies to other minerals.
Phosphorus is best supplied via young
succulent grasses obtained either by top-
dressing or systematic encouragement of
desirable grasses and the avoidance of
overstocking. Admittedly, bonemeal,
dicalcic phosphate and finely-ground
Nauru phosphate are fairly satisfac-
tory mediums for furnishing phos-
phorus, but their aid should be invoked
only if the deficiency persists after atten-
tion has been given to the grasses or in
times of shortage.
Top-dressed land gives good results not
only from the phosphates in the soil, but
because growth of a better class of herb-
age is thus encouraged.
LIFTING HEAVY POSTS.
“Lion”: This method of lifting heavy
posts is out on its own. Get two straight
stringybark poles, about sin. in dia-
meter. Bore a hole about 6in. below
the top of each pole. Thread a No. 8
wire through both, leaving about Sin.
between the two poles. The wire should
be doubled and tied securely. The poles
should be about 7ft. to Bft. long, accord-
ing to the worker’s height.
Having got the butt of the post to be
lifted over the hole, lift the top end on
to a trestle. Now place the post between
the two joined poles so that it lies on the
doubled wire, with one man on each
pole it can easily be worked into the
hole. A rest can be had when-
ever wanted, as the weight of the
post is maintained by the joined poles
resting on the ground. If the post is a
long one, care should be taken that
it does not get pushed over the vertical
and so damage your hole and give you
the trouble of lifting all over again.
LAYING SHEET IRON.
“Spring”: Sheet iron should be laid
as follows: Having placed and lined the
first three sheets so that there will be
no “running,” see that you overlay each
sheet one full corrugation and a half.
Anything less will result in a leaky roof.
From the start, one branded side should
face the sky, and on the next sheet the
brand should face the earth. If this is
continued throughout there will be no
fear of leaks.
When laying old iron this cannot be
managed, as the side with the old nail
holes on the top has to be placed
upwards, irrespective of where the brand
is. A good tip for preventing leaks is
to drive the roofing nail through a small
square of thick leather before placing
through the iron. This holds the iron
tighter, without any fear of wind allow-
ing it to enlarge the old hole and tear
out of the sheet.
Holes in the channels of old iron can
be easily and cheaply made watertight
as follows :
Get some waste wool and soak it in
any thick oil paint. Stuff the holes with
this, and allow to dry. Then paint over
them.
MORE ABOUT TRAPPING.
“Valerin”: The N.S.W. landholder
who hopes to clear his property of rab-
bits by trapping solely is an optimist.
The trapper who knows his job devotes
himself as far as possible to bucks, leav-
ing the does severely alone, a policy
which encourages breeding to the maxi-
mum.
Several careful investigations proved
that trappers’ “catches” comprise from
80 to 90 per cent, bucks, and when the
same country was poisoned later, the
poisoned rabbits were nearly all does.
I have seen country trapped through
the winter until it was hard to find a
rabbit, yet in the spring it was thick
with kittens.
Many P.P. Boards do not recognise
trapping as an “effective” method.
BUILDING THE SHED.
“Dead Finish”: Now that the shearing-
shed has the roof on, through the assist-
ance of “Bert the Carpenter” (B.
11/7/’34), it only remains to see to the

head-plank and slip the machinery up in
readiness for the barber.
Rough timber, nothing under six inches
at the small end, and at least three feet
in the ground, is satisfactory for the
posts to take the planking for the
machinery. The wall-plate of the shed
should be bolted to these on top. This
will strengthen the roof and brace
machinery posts against vibration.
With these head-posts you must depart
from the carpenter’s usual style of lining
up on the outside of the building. It is
to the inside line, where the head-planks
go, that attention must be given. If this
is not carefully watched, it will be found
that a big scarf has to be taken out of
some posts, while others may require
packing out to the line. The face of
the head-plank must be plumb perpen-
dicularly, otherwise the machinery will
be awry.
Head-planks should be bolted to posts
with iin. or fin. bolts, two to each post,
to prevent buckling. The square washer
that holds the hooping around bundles of
woolpacks will come in handy when
washering up.
If possible, splice your planks to the
posts, as this stops vibration.
When boring the head-plank for the
machine bracket allow five feet between
stands. Watch that the down-tube falls
to allow the shearer to send his sheep
straight out the chute.
The mild-steel rods “Bert the Car-
penter” recommends to pull the construc-
tion together are excellent. The holes
through which these must go, being bored
slanting, make it an awkward job to
wangle the rods through. Cut your rods
in halves, and, with a blacksmith’s forge,
make link joints, like those of the draw-
rods on a waggon. This allows plenty
of play, and it is simple to slip the rods
through the holes.
A saving can be effected in gates by
treating the letting-go pens in pairs. Place
a sheep-hurdle midway across the post at
the end of the rails dividing the first and
second pens. This covers the opening
the sheep will be counted through. Block
the balance of pen-ends on each side
with stakes. Put in three posts outside
the hurdle to hold it secure, and the job
is finished.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Gpmblegubbin”: Before storing bolts,
dip the threaded ends in melted fat or
beeswax. They will then keep any length
of time without rusting, and the nuts will
always be easy to screw off. Treat nuts
on vehicles and implements the same
way before tightening them.
“Pump”: When several mills or engines
pump into tanks, it is not always easy to
tell if the tank has overflowed in your
absence. Tie a piece of paper over the
overflow pipe. It will break when the
water reaches it.
“Searchlight”: To eradicate tar stains,
lay the stained portion of clothing on
clean blotting-paper and sprinkle with
benzine. Then cover with another sheet
of blotting-paper and press with a hot
iron. If stains are set it may be necessary
to repeat the process.
“A.C.8.”: An easy method of preserv-
ing posts in the ground is to paint with
boiled linseed oil mixed with ground-up
charcoal to consistency of paint. Apply
to portions that will be underground
with an ordinary paintbrush. Posts can,
of course, be tarred, but my way is less
expensive.
“Mulyan”: The small dam or tank in
many a dairy paddock becomes foul or
full of insects. This can be avoided by
planting reed grass (common green reeds)
along two sides, and introducing a few
small fish, such as gudgeon. The reed
grass, which should be protected from
the cattle, aerates the water and keeps it
wholesome; the fish destroy insects, par-
ticularly the larvae of mosquitoes. The
reservoir should also be shaded with
trees on the north side. Cool water does
the cattle more good than warm, and
they don’t drink so much.
“Nimbin”: To make a mouse- or rat-
trap which needs only one set-
ting, cut the top out of an oil-drum
and get a broom-handle long enough
to rest on the diameter of the
drum. Wire the handle to the disc cut
out, so that it balances evenly. Fix this
to the top of the drum so that it cannot
slip, but so as to see-saw easily. Fix
baits to the disc, and very soon after
the rodents step on it they find them-
selves struggling in the drum.
“Bufforp”: Never disturb a red meat-
ants’ nest near a henhouse in the fowl-
tick area. Coax the ants into the fowl-
house with a piece of meat, and smear
some blood along where the ticks are
hiding in the crevices. If you kill a few
all the better. The ants will scoff the lot
and generally keep the house as clean as
a whistle. Never disturb any ants —
except the termite or white-ant —from
near a chookshed.
“johnno”: Finely-powdered charcoal
is better than salt to neutralise a bait
(“Bullant,” B. 18/7/’34). Charcoal is
an antidote to strychnine—dog poisoners
almost invariably use strychnine—and jf
given in time will save any dog. The
difficult part of the job is to get the dose
down the dog’s throat. Pull his mouth
wide open and throw a handful of the
powder well down. Then close his
mouth, and hold it firmly shut until he
gulps down the medicine. Some stock-
owners I know never ride out without a
tin of powdered charcoal.
“Darken”: A handy torch for light-
ing bracken heaps and such can be made
from a piece of old, rotten rope and a
3ft. or 4ft. pipe. Push the rope through
the pipe, leaving a few unravelled inches
outside. Dip this in dirty kerosene or
oil. At the handle end leave a foot or
so of rope to feed through. Lighted, this
will burn for a good while, and can
be pushed well into any heap.
“Jumbuck”: To prevent the spread of
galvanised burr on holdings with only
isolated patches, spray with an arsenic
pentoxide solution, lib. to each gallon
of water. By carrying a gallon fin of
the mixture on the saddle and a small
sprinkler, scores of isolated plants can
be treated quickly and easily.
“N.W.J.H.”: When ploughing in long
green weeds or the like with a swing
plough, use a fairly heavy chain and
fasten one end to each end of the
double horse bar, thus making a long
loop. Adjust the chain so that when the
horses are pulling the sod being turned
just misses the chain. This will be found
more effective than the single chain and
no knots are needed.
“Karaway”: To mend the split shaft
of a cart, cut a long thin strand of
greenhide, soak it and stretch it, and
while it is still wet bind it neatly round
the damaged part of the shaft. The skin
draws up as it dries, making a lasting
job.
“Jaw”: I differ from “Cockyson’s”
idea (B. 18/7/’34) that the roots of culti-
vated crops other than lucerne and fruit-
trees do not penetrate below the depth
of soil worked. Crops such as wheat,
oats, barley, all penetrate well below the
worked soil. Even maize, which is con-
sidered a shallow rooter, has a root sys-
tem which goes down 2ft.
“Tailin’ Weaners”: I’ve tailed weaners
all day because it is considered the
proper thing to do. There were dozens
of other jobs which I wanted to do, and
at least half of them would have kept me
better employed. All the early training
in the world will be useless if those cattle
aren’t handled properly later in life. The
whole process of tailing and turning,
yarding and handling can be nullified in
one act by a bad stockman letting a
beast break away and go bush. If
cattle are handled in a different manner
from that in which they were tailed as
weaners, then that tailing is only so
much waste time. And if they are to be
handled properly later on, and are under
cattlemen who know how to handle them,
then tailing isn’t necessary.

duce power alcohol from it ? (2) Approxi-
mate quantities of alcohol to be obtained in
proportion to wheat used? (3) Approximate
cost of necessary plant to produce, say, 500
gallons of power alcohol weekly ? (4) What
denaturants must be used, in what quantities
and cost of denaturing ? —2630.
(1) The ordinary alcohol distillation process
is used: that is, malting, followed by fermenting
the resultant mash and then distilling off the
alcohol. (2) One bushel of wheat produces
about 2.2 gallons of 95 p.c. alcohol. (3) £lOOO
to £l5OO. (4) Some time ago the require-
ments were: 1 p.c. of wood naphtha, p.c.
of pyridine, and not less than 2 p.c. of one
of the following: approved coal tar naphtha,
benzol, shale naphtha, petrol, gasoline, petroleum
benzine, petroleum naphtha, ether or the like
substances. It would be desirable to consult
the Department of Trade and Customs on this
point and others connected with any new pro-
ject for power-alcohol manufacture. The
approximate cost of denaturing by the formula
mentioned amounts to about lid. per gallon of
alcohol.

LEAVES FROM THE PAST.
XIII .—Exploded Exploration.
The courage and resource of early Aus-
tralian explorers have been much over-
rated. Their task was really quite simple.
The whole country lay there waiting to
be explored, and whichever way they
went they had to find something. Take
Blaxland and co., who crossed the Blue
Mountains. The mountains were there,
and it was just a matter of climbing over
them. They knew for certain there must
be something on the other side, otherwise
where would the west wind come from?
Then there was Sturt’s trip down the
Murray. A pleasant jaunt, but with no
real difficulties. There weren’t even any
locks to negotiate. He knew that the
river couldn’t go on for ever. It must
end somewhere. (Tennyson’s Brook had
not been discovered then.) Of course,
there was the possibility that it might end
up in China, where he’d have had diffi-
culty in passing the dictation test, but
the chance was a remote one. Anyhow,
when he got to the Murray mouth, there
was no necessity to row back again. That
was mere swank. There are two good
hotels in Goolwa.
As for Stuart and other transcontinen-
tal ists —well, their job was mere child’s
play. All they had to do was stick to
the Overland Telegraph Line, and they
couldn’t go wrong. But all the explorers
were profoundly lacking in imagination.
The most notable Australian explorer,
apart from Cabinet Ministers, was Louis
de Rougemont.
Unlike the others,
he possessed an
excellent imagina-
tion, which was of
great assistance to
him during and
after his travels.
Hi s wonderful
ride on a turtle
from Alice Springs
to Broome, with-
out saddle, bridle,
soap or a change
of underwear, was
one of the epics of
the nineteenth cen-
tury. It was un-
fortunate that he
related his experi-
ences to a genera-
tion brought up on
the dry -as - dust
narratives of the
orthodox explorers.
Consequently he
was not believed,
and when unscru-
pulous people dis-
covered that Baron
Miinchhausen and
George Washing-
ton were remote
twigs of his family
tree he was brand-
ed as an impostor.
He challenged his
accusers to a turtle
race, post entries,
flying start, free rules—first past the
post to take the purse and foie—but
no one came forth. Dispirited, he left
the countiy The present historian is
prepared to say that if anyone were to
ride a turtle over the same route to-day
he would encounter just as many swarms
of flying wombats and showers of frogs,
flsh and « oannas as De R ° a Semont did.
But turtles are so expensive nowadays.

CRICKET QUOTAS.
Are the grand old traditions of cricket
to be sacrificed on the altar of political
expediency? The “Daily Blah” has in-
formation which discloses an infamous
attempt to barter our sporting birthright
for a mess of meat quotas.
We challenge the Federal Government
to deny that it has been in negotiation
with the British Cabinet to allow Eng-
land to win the fifth Test in return for
a substantial increase in the Australian
meat-import quota,
and that Brad-
man, McCabe,
Chipperfield and
O’Reilly are to be
dropped in return
for a guaranteed
British price of 7s.
6d. a bushel for
Australian wheat.
Election or no
election, Mr.
Lyons must assert
himself and pre-
vent this iniquitous
bargain, which in-
volves also the
banning of Danish
butter in England
in return for our
letting England
have an innings
win in the Test
and 75 per cent, of
the remaining
county matches.
The “Daily
Blah” calls on its
readers to take up
the challenge. Our
boys must not be
sacrificed to make
a farmers’ holiday.
Sign the pledge on
the sporting page
undertaking not to
eat meat, bread or butter until this sinis-
ter bargaining away of a people’s rights
is publicly repudiated. This may be good
business, but it’s not cricket. After all
the game’s the thing.

ON WITH THE DANCE.
“A masked dance, during which showers
of balloons fell upon the dancers, was one
of the novelties of the Taxation Social and
Recreation Club’s annual ball.”
—Sydney “Telegraph.”
Things were slightly different down at
the annual ball of the Taxpayers’ Sob
Club. Fox-trots monopolised the pro-
gramme, chiefly because the members are
accustomed to being hounded from pillar
to post. Summons-blue dominated the
decorative scheme, with here and there
a touch of red-tape and crape. Beneath
a huge wreath the debs, were presented
to the Dole Commissioner, some very
striking ensembles of sugar-bag brown
and flour-bag grey being worn. A
quaint novelty was the shower of final-
notice papers during the “Desperation
Blues,” played with deadly effect by
the Morgue band under the baton of a
Bankruptcy Court Judge. After a rush
supper of dog-biscuits and “starvers,”
the Sydney police choir foolishly volun-
teered to sing “Abide with Me.” The
entire club rushed the offer.

HARD ON HIM.
He paused outside his wife’s people’s
place. He knew that, following his
abrupt departure after a violent row
some little time ago, his wife had gone
back to her parents. But how would he
be received? That letter he had sent
had been a bit on the strong side —that
would have to be reckoned with. As
he entered and stood there, awkwardly
trying to say something, the bulky form
of his father-in-law loomed up. At sight
of his daughter’s husband he uttered a
hoarse cry of rage and, picking up the
offending letter, dashed it lull in his face.
They planted him, toes up, the next
day.
He was most unfortunate to have
lived in that remote period of history
when the method of correspondence was
by chipping hieroglyphics out of a slab
of solid rock!

PROBLEM PICTURE.

cigar; what the girl is about to reply to

has just said, and what the bulldog is think-

linger. Slippery Dan, hero of many a
Darlinghurst affray, was more deserving
of their attention.
The local man’s prowess cannot be
doubted. He is wonderfully versatile —
can shoot a man’s ear off with a gun or
slice it off with a razor with the same
perfect equality of ease.
Perhaps his greatest feat was his hand-
ling of two opponents at once. They
rushed him, so he pulled out his gun,
which contained only one bullet, and
fired between them. Then, whipping out
his razor, he sliced the bullet in halves
just after it left the barrel. The division
and the deflection were perfect. Yes —
both stone dead!

UNDOUBTEDLY.
The prosperous man and the over-
underdressed girl got on the tram and
apparently had run out of conversation.
Shortly the male sought to find it by
making a remark about some untidy build-
ings. “Factories are dingy places always ;
it is. gold-diggers who have made Aus-
tralia,” was his comment. The girl
turned on him sharply as if sensing an
affront; then she flashed a smile. “Yes,
we have brightened up the old place,”
she said.

THE LESSON.
They met while staying at'the beach:
The fragile dinger she,
The girl that needs strong manly arms;
A manly man was he.
He said he’d show her how to swim—
‘‘You’ll be all right with me.”
“I know,” she murmured, smiling shy ;
‘‘l’ve no anxiety.”
The surf was cold; she screamed aloud
And clung to him in fright.
“Be brave,” he urged, “and trust in me ;
I’ll get you back all right.”
The undertow swept both from land;
It certainly looked grim.
“They’re safe,” the local surfers cried.
“Now watch her rescue him.”

And, pleased with him, they let him go

He’s skirted all his troubles.

Information Sought.
(1) When were moving pictures invented ?
(2) When were they first shown in Australia ?
—2736.
(1) Several English, French and American
inventors claim this honor. The first practical
invention was marketed in the beginning of
1896, and was installed in Koster and Bial’s
music hall, New York, on April 20, 1896, when
600 feet of film was shown as an added attrac-
tion to the vaudeville programme. (2) October,
1896, in premises in Pitt-street, Sydney, near the
corner of Market-street, alongside Roberts’s
Hotel.
(1) Origin of the word squatter? (2) Does
it refer to a large or small sheep-farmer ? (3)
What is the dijferen.ee between a pastoralist
and a squatter ? —2786.
(1) It was originally applied to the cattle-
men and sheepowners who “squatted,” without
legal right, on land outside the region in N.S.W.
where settlement could legally be established,
with the view of later securing full title to the
land. Governor Brisbane encouraged the prac-
tice, disapproved by Macquarie, and allowed
them to settle on Government land under legal
restrictions. (2) The squatters usually occu-
pied large areas and-raised-sheep on an exten-
sive scale. (3) A pastoralist is one who raises
sheep or cattle. A squatter could be any sort
of farmer, though he - usually did go in for
livestock breeding.
Occasionally men are deported from Nor-
folk Island and, as a preliminary, are • sub-
jected by the authorities to a foreign-language
test. (1) What is the object of this test ?■' (2)
Under what Act are proceedings taken ? —2593.
(1) The object is to prohibit the admission
or terminate the stay of persons whom it is
desired to exclude, and the choice of the lan-
guage to be used for the purpose (any Euro-
pean language) rests..with the officer applying
the test arid not with the immigrant. A similar
provision has been included in the Common-
wealth Immigration Laws. (2) Immigration
Restriction Ordinance, 1922.
What is vodka ? What is it made from and
is it pleasant to taste? Has any attempt ever
been made to prohibit it in Russia ? —2353.
Vodka is Russian brandy, the national
spirituous drink of Russia. Originally it was
distilled from rye, but maize and potato spirit
are now often used. It contains about 50
per cent, of alcohol and has a flavor that does
not recommend itself to people other than
Russians. Its sale was prohibited in Russia
during the Great War. The effects of vodka
drinking amongst those who cannot purchase
spirit of good quality constitute one of the
social problems of Russia. An effort towards
enforcing prohibition failed in 1917.
How and when did (1) the Republic of
Czechoslovakia and (2) the Kingdom of Yugo-
slavia come into being? —2763.
(1) The Czecho-Slovak State cameintoexistence
on October 28, 1918. On that day the Ndrodni
Vybor (National Council) took over the govern-
ment of the Czecho-Slovak countries, including
Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, and Slovakia, which
had previously belonged to the Austro-
Hungarian monarchy. On November 14, 1918,
the Czecho-Slovak National Assembly met in
Prague, and formally declared the Czecho-Slovak
State to be a republic, with Dr. T. G. Masaryk
as its first President. (2) After the revolution
in Austria-Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Dal-
matia and Bosnia declared their independence,
and their union with Serbia, together with that
of Montenegro, which had been voted on
November 13, 1918, was proclaimed on Decem-
ber 1, 1918, when the official 1 name of the
State was announced as being the Triune King-
dom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In
1929 the name was changed to the Kingdom of
Y ugoslavia.
(1) Geographical distribution of the Sampson-
fish ? (2) Its habits? (3) What does it eat?
(4) Method of capture ? —2768.
(1) So far this fish has been recorded as
existing only in the waters of N.S.W. It is
probable that it will be found to have a much
wider range when the Australian seas have been
thoroughly investigated, for it is a powerful
swimmer and a lover of the open sea. (2) In
habits it resembles in many respects its confrere
the kingfish, but, although it is often found in
shoals, these are never so numerous and rarely
so large as those of that species. It is usually
to be found in deep water off rocky headlands.
(3) Smaller fish, and, to a lesser extent, crusta-
ceans. (4) It is sometimes taken in the net at
the mouth of the estuaries, though the line
comprises the principal means of capture. It
readily takes a fish bait, and when hooked
puts up a valiant and stubborn fight for free-
dom. For its size it is probably as strong and
as game a fighter as any fish found in our
waters. Unless the tackle used is very strong,
considerable skill and patience are necessary to
land the fish.
Can you tell me something about the short-
nosed bandicoot of Victoria? —2801.
It is a compact, short-legged animal, some-
what larger than a rat. Although called “short-
nosed” its muzzle is long, though the long-
nosed bandicoot and Gunn’s bandicoot have
longer ones. The tail is short, and the hair on
the body is coarse and spiny. The upper surface
is grizzled, yellowish-brown, and the under
surface yellowish-white. This is the commonest
species in Victoria, and it is found in numbers
quite close to Melbourne. It feeds upon insects
and their larvae and earthworms, and will also
eat roots and bulbs. It makes its home among
the roots of trees, or by scratching a depres-
sion under clumps of grass or low bushes. The
species may be identified by its short, rounded
ears.
Family and species of Australian wood
known as ‘‘saffron heart”? —2654.
The name was coined by the Q. Forest Ser-
vice to denote two species of Halfordia, H.
drupifera and H. sideroxylon, belonging to the
family Rutaceoe.
A few details concerning Henry Handel
Richardson, the Australian novelist ? —2770.
The lady who writes under that nom de
plume was born in Melbourne, was educated
at the Presbyterian Ladies’ College, and studied
music in Leipzig. She married John George
Robertson, Professor of German Language
and Literature at London Uni., who died in
May, 1933. Her publications include “Maurice
Guest,” “The Getting of Wisdom,” “The For-
tunes of Richard Mahony,” “The Way Home”
and “Ultima Thule.”
(1) What is the prayer said daily among
Mohammedans ? (2) What is the person called
who leads the prayer? (3) Must all Moham-
medans stop work when it is called? —2T54.
(1) The azan, consisting of seven or eight
phrases, to each of which there is a set re-
sponse to be used by the hearer. (2) The
muezzin proclaims the azah standing at the
door or in the minaret of the mosque, with
his face towards Mecca .and his ears, stopped
by his fingers. (3)' During the proclamation
passers in the street must stand still, all work
must cease and even the sick must sit up in
bed. \
(1) Some details about actress Peg Woffing-
ton ? (2) Where can I obtain a biography ?
—2368.
(1) She was Irish by birth, and played in Dub-
lin from 1732 to 1740. Her London debut was
at Covent Garden under Rich in “The Recruit-
ing Officer” (1740). She also acted at Drury
Lane and lived for some years with Garrick.
She often appeared in male characters, notably
as Sir Harry Wildair in “The Constant Couple.”
She excelled in comedy as a lady of high rank
(Lady Plyant, Lady Betty Modish, Millamant,
etc.), and also acted in tragedy. (2) See life by
Molloy (1884); Daly (1888), Taylor and Reade’s
and .Faces” (1852), and P. Reade’s
“Woffington” (1899).
Origin of the phrase “tweedledum and
tweedledee” ?— 2644.
The 1 phrase' occurred about 1720, in lines
by John Byrom, referring to the feud between
Handel and Bononcini, rival musicians at
the time —
-Some, say, compared to Bononcini,
That .Mynheer Handel’s but a ninny;
Others aver that he to Handel

What provisions are made for the training
of school-teachers in Victoria ? —2809.
All entrants to the service must successfully
complete probationary period as junior teachers
in the schools before entering one of the
teachers’ colleges. Junior teachers who do not
complete their leaving certificate, or who are
unable to obtain studentships at a teachers
college within five years, are asked to leave the
service. There arc teachers’ colleges m Vic-
toria at Melbourne, Ballarat and Bendigo. The
Melbourne College is the largest institution,
training students for all types of teaching work;
Ballarat and Bendigo are smaller colleges, pre-
paring teachers for work in the rural schools.
Is it lawful in N. S. Wales for a man to
marry his deceased wife’s brother’s daughter ?
—2754. , ,
In 1563 the Church of England drew up
a table setting out for marriage purposes the
prohibited degrees of consanguinity or affinity,
and in the reign of William IV. these degrees
were made part of the law of England. In
N. S. Wales and sister States this table has
been varied by legislation permitting marriage
to a deceased wife’s sister. Under the original
table it was not permissible for a man to marry
his deceased wife’s brother’s daughter, but it
has not been decided how far such relation-
ship is affected by local legislation. In Vic.
it has been held that a marriage between a man
and the daughter of his deceased wife’s sister
is voidable and may be set aside during the
lifetime of the parties; after death, however,
the validity of the marriage or the legitimacy
of the children cannot be questioned.

open to anybody resident in Australia who at
any period during the three years ending
December, 1934, has been a pupil of any recog-
nised art school or teacher. Entries in both

(1) and (2) No comparative data available.
Communicate with the De Havilland Aircraft,
Mascot aerodrome, Sydney. (3) and (4) Every
aircraft has a minimum speed at which it
travels steadily. This minimum speed occurs
when the force on the wings reaches its highest
value; i.e., when they are inclined at an angle
of approximately 15 deg. to the horizontal air-
flow. If increased beyond 15 deg. total force
of wings suddenly becomes less than its maxi-
mum value. In this condition the aeroplane is
very unstable laterally, and, if one wing should
drop or have its incidence increased, there is
a tendency to spin. This condition of instability
is termed the stall. The lateral controls of some
aircraft are not powerful enough to raise the
lowered wing unless the nose of the aeroplane
is lowered and the forward speed is increased.
In considering the general theory of slots it is
usual to suppose that they are fitted to the
whole of the leading edge of the wing, and in
this application their effect is to give a greatly
increased maximum lift at a larger angle of
incidence than. is the case with an unslotted
wing. Beyond this angle of incidence a sudden
loss of lift is experienced and the wing stalls
as before. The action of slots is that of
smoothing out the airflow over the upper
surface of the wing as it approaches the original
stalling attitude. Normally, the airflow tends
to break away or “burble” at the trailing
edge portion of the wing when approaching the
stalling, attitude. By only slotting a portion of
the wing the slotted and unslotted portions stall
at different angles of incidence, the combined
effect being that the sudden loss of lift is
avoided after the wing has reached the angle
of maximum lift or stalling incidence. The
partially slotted wing, therefore, is a close
approach to a wing having no vices.

PRACTICALLY every man, between

fortune.
The question is—“ How much of the
money which has passed through his
hands has simply disappeared, and
how much has been used so as to pro-
vide against inevitable old age, sick-
ness and death?”
Not every man can make investments
that are remunerative and permanent,
but, happily, the system of life assur-
ance puts easily within his reach a
means of securing the future for him-
self and those who look to him.

THE PALETTE
The Royal Art Society of N.S.W. com-
fortably fills the walls of the Education
Department’s,gallery, Sydney, with a show
strong in landscape. In this department
Erik Langker shows great development.
His “Night Reflections,” “Ever so
Humble” and “Sunlit Road” admirably
capture the spirit of the scenes they por-
tray. Syd Long is still reaching after
mystic beauties 'of form and color, and
achieves the sort of results he seems to
be pursuing in “Wiseman’s Ferry,” “The
Approaching Storm” and a canvas named
simply “Landscape.” The ever-reliable
J. R. Jackson is at his most reliable in
“Old Road, South Coast,” which has been
bought for the gallery. J. S. Watkins
demonstrates his versatility in a nicely-
balanced water-color landscape, “On the
Hawkesbury River,” a fine sky in “Old
Water Reserve, Botany,” a faithful portrait
in oils of T. E. Rofe, a good interior study
and a striking head in charcoal. Tom
Garrett’s monochromes and W. Lister
Lister’s dappled representations of Austra-
lian scenery help to raise the average of
the landscape section. Charles Bryant, in
addition to marine studies in his usual
style, has two pictures of London, “St.
Paul’s” and “The Thames Near Black-
friars,” which demonstrate that he is a
much better draughtsman than anyone
suspected. Stephen Bransgrove shows
three very striking canvases, all of Ameri-
can origin, one of which, “Winter Morn-
ing,” goes to the Gallery. In portraiture
Normand Baker’s “Mrs. Alex. Miller,”
Lyall Tindall’s self-portrait, E. J. White-
Burgess’s “Edna” and H. A. Hanke’s
vigorous impression of pianist Trixie
Tange are notable. Hanke also shows
a robustly-drawn scene, “The Fruit
Market.” George Johnstone’s self-por-
trait, bought for the Gallery, is a splendid
piece of pencil work. In still-life, A. J.
Sherman’s “Morning” and “Evening”
lead a not very long nor distinguished
procession. There are few nudes ; the
best is Lyall Tindall’s “Rhythms of Life.”
The cameos of R. Rajola are very
daintily executed, and the miniatures of
Dorothy M. Bates should not be over-
looked.
Despite the poet, four walls do a
prison make, and iron bars a cage. Even
the most hardened criminal dislikes a
strait-waistcoat as a permanent article
of apparel, and the person who prefers
legirons to liberty has yet to be found
outside a hospital for the insane. Hence
the pecks, dabs and splashes, plus draw-
ings and monotypes, of the Contemporary
Art Group at Melbourne Athenaeum are
intelligible as a series of valorous
attempts by sundry earnest students to
escape from the Pentridge of academic
art. Unfortunately, the occasions for
sinning are greater in the outside world
than in a prison cell, and many of the
fugitives appear to have exchanged one
house of detention for another, where
the accommodation is just as limited. To
make the paradox complete, the escapees
have voluntarily walked into their new
prison, locked the door and anchored
themselves to the wall. Messrs. Frater
and Shaw, for instance, are seen to be
singing their song of freedom through the
window of the cell previously occupied
by Cezanne, Gauguin and Van Gogh
lan Fairweather is at hard labor carving
figures out of wood with an axe, and
Roland Wakelin is doing the same thing
with trees, hills and skies. In his “Organ-
ised Line in Yellow,” S. Atyeo has gone
bush and joined the abos. Miss A. M.
Plante’s “Landscape” is more like a
genuine impression of nature than most
of the rest, though it is crude, and
in her “The Creek” everything looks like
running water, except the water. Isabel
Tweddle’s quick sketches of European
scenes also betray a knowledge of appear-
ances. But to say this may be to insult
the lady, for, as a group, the Contem-
poraries seem to regard a knowledge of
appearances as a capital offence.
The menu of the New Melbourne Art
Club at the Athenaeum has dishes to suit
almost all tastes. Miss Sybil Craig
serves academic realism in a series of
still-life and portraits. Miss Peggy
Crombie proves that she can repeat any
of the National Gallery recipes from
memory, and John Vickery demonstrates
that he found Nature suffering from suc-
cessive attacks of vertigo. Jessie Mackin-
tosh is a modernist even in her arith-
metic. There were only one pot and one
plant in her picture labelled “Pot-plants”
when present critic looked at it. W.
Constable, unlike his famous namesake,
is unaffected by the fact that Nature
presents herself to the eye in a fascinat-
ing variety of planes and a subtle scheme
of tonal relationships which ordinary
painters spend a lifetime in endeavoring
to transfer to canvas: he reduces every-
thing to a flat pattern and sees the deli-
cate profiles of children in terms of
heavy line and coarse color. Edward
Heffernan has the greatest degree of
delicacy and the sincerest ambition of
all the exhibitors, but he has chosen
water-color for his medium. If this artist
took to oils he would have a chance of
escaping from his present limitations.
On the whole, the new club lacks a con-
certed and intelligible aim, in which it
differs from those Australian art move-
ments of the past which have left their
mark on history. They are an orchestra
of young people without a conductor, and
their understanding of their instruments
is not in proportion to their aspirations.
Expatriate Dora Meeson has been chas-
ing the sun, mainly in Italy and France,
and the results have been hanging at the
Fine Arts, Melbourne. She is an
astute mixer of various approved for-
niulae. Some of her pictures show the
influence of Brangwyn, and she slaps the
paint about with Will Ashton’s con-
tempt for the rising price of pigment.
She has a passion for the kaleidoscopic
color schemes of Mediterranean fishing
ports, but she can sing a quieter song
when an opportunity like “Snow in
Chelsea” presents itself. Three of the
paintings have been Paris Salon exhibits.
“F.S.”: Bernard Hall, the Vic. Nat.
Gallery director, who is travelling in
Europe for the Felton Bequest, has fol-
lowed up his suggestion to buy another
Alma Tadema by recommending the
purchase for £2OO of a contemporary
copy by Henry Stone of Van Dyck’s
“King Charles I. with Monsieur de St.
Antoine,” and the trustees have con-
sented. This choice has no justification,
artistic or historical. The picture is a
conventional imitation of Velasquez’s
equestrian portraits, and the horse looks
as if it ought to be on a rocker. It is
not a great painting, and, though Hall
says the copy is in itself “a work of
art,” it can only be in the sense that a
good copy of anything is one. Such
replicas have a virtuoso value, like the
faithful playing of a sonata, but a slight
original sketch by an Australian painter,
as long as it is a record of the artist’s
own knowledge of nature, would have
been a more intelligible selection.

HOW TO CUT RUNNING COSTS
FRICTION THE THIEF OF POWER.
BY FRED BERRY.
N° matter what the initial cost of a new car, it is safe to
assume that running expenses and maintenance charges will
amount in 1 0 years to six or seven times the capital outlay.
Drivers who study the minor details, important if economy
in running costs is to be achieved, can save the price of a new
car in a decade.
Motorists who can afford to buy a new-
model each year know within narrow
limits their outlay for depreciation. The
. majority, however, for obvious reasons,
must continue with the original car for
several years. To whichever group one
may belong, the practical advice given
here will not only ensure a definite sav-
ing in operation and maintenance costs
but, equally important, will ensure a
better price when the time comes to sell.
When any two parts of a car in con-
tact with one another begin to move fric-
tion is set up. Wear can be retarded in
direct proportion to the care bestowed
upon these units. Tyres wear because of
friction on the roadway ; cylinder bores
and pistons, through friction of piston
rings ; bearings, through friction of rotat-
ing shafts; brake-linings, through fric-
tion of brake-drums ; and even uphol-
stery, through friction of clothes.
Reduction of Friction.
Ideal conditions for the reduction of
friction—impossible, of course, in prac-
tice—can be represented by two pieces
of glass between which a protecting film
of oil has been placed. These could be
rubbed together for untold years without
showing wear so long as the lubricant
was present in the right quantity, the
inference being that in operating a car
it is of the first importance to see that
friction is eliminated or reduced to a
practicable minimum.
Care is especially necessary during the
“running-in” period. Although the metal
surfaces of the various moving parts of
a new car appear to the unaided eye per-
fectly smooth, a microscopic examina-
tion would reveal a series of hills and
hollows. Hence drivers must exercise
restraint during the first thousand miles,
Examples of faulty wheel alignment in-
volving increased tyre wear. Weak
springs are sometimes responsible for the
defect.
never using full throttle at any time,
however great the temptation. Failure
to observe this policy strictly will inevit-
ably result in a partial seizure of some
unit—maybe a cylinder wall, piston or
bearing. Whatever it is, the motor will
never give its best during the rest of the
life of the car. On the other hand, care-
ful and painstaking control during this
critical period will ensure that all fric-
tion surfaces are stropped to a mirror-
like finish.
During the “running-in” period the sub-
ject of lubrication requires careful study,
for, although bearing loads are low and
oiling systems almost foolproof in
modern machines, too much reliance on
these factors may lead to careless and

Excellent “Motor” impression of speed. Hon. R. E. Lewis crossing the finishing
line at Mannin Moar at a speed of 140 m.p.h.
A good deal depends upon whether
the motor is equipped with an efficient
oil-purifier, but in any case crankcase
oil replacement at definite intervals is
essential.
A good engine with well-fitting piston
rings and crankshaft bearings should con-
sume very little oil, but it must be re-
membered that the quality of the oil
deteriorates considerably, even though
the quantity remains constant. The hap-
hazard driver continues for several thou-
sand miles without replacement, deem-
ing fresh oil a wasteful expenditure, but
he is penny wise and pound foolish.
Lubrication Problems.
Oil, however high its quality, should
be changed at least every 2000 miles, for
the reason that after that distance petrol
dilution, together with minute particles
of carbon, introduces a risk of lubrica-
tion failure.
As a rule motorists are content, and
wisely so, to obey makers’ instructions
as to the oil to be used in filling the
sump, but in at least two other directions
can owners play for safety.
First, as a safeguard against seizure in
the “running-in” period, colloidal
graphite should be added to the engine
oil and small quantities to each tank of
fuel. By this means “hills and hollows”
in all bearing surfaces are speedily filled
with an ideal lubricant, and the perfect
surface is quickly attained. Further-
more, as the greatest damage is done to
any motor during the few minutes after
starting from cold each morning, an
upper-cylinder lubricator, supplying as it
does a film of “greasy” oil to the piston
walls after stopping at night, is a sound
investment. Not only will upper-cylinder
lubrication, correctly applied, assist
early-morning starting, but installation
cost will usually be saved in prolonging
the life of the battery.
Another direction in which money can
be wasted is in continuing to drive with
binding or badly-adjusted brakes.
Modern cars usually have such a huge
reserve of power that the retarding effect
of binding brakes is scarcely noticeable,
yet expenses of operation are increased
by reason of fuel wasted in overcoming
friction.
Testing is a simple process. Jack up
one of the rear wheels, put gear-lever in
neutral and release brake. Then give
the raised wheel a spin by hand and see
what happens. Half a dozen noiseless
tikrns are an indication of correct adjust-
ment, but a lesser number coupled with
a scraping sound demands immediate
attention.
Job for Specialist.
If something is wrong, it is cheaper in
the long run to take the car to a brake
specialist and have the job done thor-
oughly and by scientific methods, but
failing this opportunity the owner-driver
can remove each wheel in turn. See that
brake-bands or -shoes, as the case may
be, throw clear when the pedal is re-
leased ; also, that all moving parts of
the assembly, including actuating rods in
mechanical types, are freed from rust and
mud. Bearings should be lubricated with
light oil before reassembly. In cases
where it is noted that rivets are project-
ing through linings new linings should
be fitted without further delay.
With regard to gearbox and differential
assembly, unnecessary friction through
the use of heavy greases instead of thin
engine oil or special light compounds
means wasted fuel and lower efficiency.
There is no need to adhere to the old-
fashioned ideas of greases for gearboxes
and differential. Drivers who use these
materials know what a difficult matter
it is to pull the gear-lever through when
changing after a cold-morning start.
To save undue tyre wear it is essential
to maintain correct wheel alignment and
correct tyre pressure in relation to load,
and to make rational use of clutch,
brakes and acceleration.
Cars were never designed to move
crab-fashion, with wheels out of track.
Bendix duo-servo brake-shoes, showing
closing springs, coupling links and operat-
ing cam.
This results in a scrubbing action of the
tread on the road and tremendous in-
crease in wear. It has been computed
that if the wheels are |in. out of align-
ment the tyre is pushed sideways for
16 miles in every thousand travelled!
Last but not least of the aids prized
by the sensible driver is the possession
of a reliable tyre-pressure gauge. Its cost
will be saved in a few months if makers’
pressures are regularly checked and
strictly adhered to.
Alfa Romeo Wins Mannin Moar.
Douglas (Isle of Man) closed all roads
to vehicular traffic to allow ten of the
world’s fastest racing cars to fight out
a 50-lap event.
Streaking down the Promenade lap
after lap at better than 130 m.p.h., Hon.
R. E. Lewis, at the wheel of a 2.6-litre
Special Alfa Romeo, made goats of the
opposition, many of whom crashed in
forcing their cars to the limit.
Dixon, driving a Riley, was cornering
like a demon in an effort to make up
the leeway, but finally came unstuck on
the Onchan Hairpin, ran up a side road
and missed a place.
Results: 1, Hon. R. E. Lewis (Alfa
Romeo), 75.34 m.p.h. ; 2, C. J. P. Dodson
(Alfa Romeo), 73.61 m.p.h. ; 3, Cyril

Effect of Heat on Tyres.
During extremely hot weather many
motorists, thinking the heat will affect
their tyres, run them inflated at a lower
pressure than they would do under
normal weather conditions. This is a
wrong procedure, inasmuch as the in-
creased flexing of the walls of tyres
generates considerably more heat in the
covers than if the tyres were inflated to
the pressure specified in the maker’s in-
flation-pressure table.
Dunlops say any pressure increase due
to running under hot-weather conditions is
extremely small and of no consequence.
This will be realised when it is mentioned
that, if a tyre were inflated to 251 b. with
air cooled down to freezing point, it
would rise to only 281 b. if the air in tyre
rose to 90 degrees Fahr.
The generation of heat through tyre
flexing is of far more, importance to tyre
life, for even under normal inflation
tyres absorb some 2\ h.p., and this heat
rises rapidly if the flexing of the covers
is increased through under-inflation.
On a. very hot day the slight pres-
sure rise of the contained air is an ad-
vantage, because by reducing the flexing
of walls of covers less heat is generated
from that cause.
The best rule for motor-owners to
follow, for all ordinary purposes, is to
adhere to the pressures set out in the
tyre-maker’s pressure chart, which gener-
ally allows for any slight increase of the
contained air.
Inter-State Reciprocity.
A commendable movement to facili-
tate the issue of permits to motorists
travelling inter-State is announced, the
three States interested being N. S. Wales,
Vic. and S.A. It has been the custom,
when driving a car across the border of
any of the States mentioned, for the
visiting motorist to call at border police
stations for the necessary windscreen disc
—a practice that on many occasions leads
to delay and embarrassment.
It is now proposed that motorists
before leaving Sydney, Melbourne or
Adelaide for another State will be
able, on application to the respective
motor-registration branch, to obtain a
visiting permit for affixing to windscreen
instead of having to make a stop at
border towns, sometimes at very incon-
venient hours.
The disc will be issued only at capi-
tal cities. Country motorists who on
their journey do not pass through the
capital city of their State will still have
to call at the first police station across
the border.
Motor Oddities.
“Black Mountain”: R. Langley, of
Chiltern (Vic.), drove his car home the
other day with the engine functioning
perfectly. Next morning his car wouldn’t
start. It was towed to a garage, where
the trouble was found to be a rat. It
had got trapped in the hot-air induction
pipe.
Preventing Roadside Accidents.
More Control Necessary at Intersections.
Of the last year’s reported motoring
mishaps more than 25 per cent, were due
to collisions at intersections. In Sydney
regulations were framed some time ago
to organise pedestrian traffic in the metro-
politan area and prevent as far as
possible the practice of crossing streets
on a diagonal. But this is not enough.
The lead of older countries should be
followed in making it compulsory for
any driver of a vehicle turning from a
side road into a main thoroughfare to
come to a standstill, regardless of
whether there are or are not any vehicles
on the main road.
Of course, it will never be possible to
restrain the road hog or the drunken
motorist, but a raised concrete strip built
across side streets adjacent to main-road
crossings should have a steadying influ-
ence upon the reckless driver, as well as
serving to remind careless or ignorant
people of their responsibilities.

COMPULSORY CAR INSURANCE.
Australia has gone to greater lengths in protecting its
people from pecuniary loss in the event of accident, injury or
sickness than most other countries, but it is still possible that a
person may be knocked down by an uninsured automobile and
forced by circumstances to foot the bill himself.
Compulsory third-party-risk car in-
surance exists in M.L., an annual pre-
mium of £1 per car being collected at
time of registration. Legislation has been
introduced in Victoria, and is promised
in N. S. Wales.
It has been argued that with everyone
covered motorists would exercise less
care, and that the high premium may
debar the youngster from buying his first
car.
There is not much in the first objec-
tion. The majority of motorists realise
that damage to others
always means damage to
themselves, with an ensu-
ing period during which
use of the car is lost.
There is, however, some
merit in the argument that'
the youth, generally an
ex-motor-cyclist, who pays
£3O or £4O for a second-
hand car would find an
additional charge for in-
surance rather a burden.
Still, a start has to be made
somewhere, and there must be no excep-
tions. The old crock constitutes a far
greater menace than does the more ex-
pensive type of car, by reason of its
greater liability to failure and mechanical
breakdown. Quite a big percentage of
irresponsible drivers uses these scrap-
heap machines, and they do not worry
overmuch what damage they do, for they
stand to lose little even in the event of
a serious crash.
Fortunately agents and distributors
insist upon covering every car sold by
them on the hire-purchase plan, regard-
less of the owner’s wishes. This means
that for at least a year the car is insured.
Damage to the vehicle itself is not of
great moment, for in this respect pre-
miums could readily be adjusted to suit
the pocket of the insured. For instance,
if the motorist elects to bear the cost of
all repairs up to £lO, his premium would
be correspondingly less than that of the
man who desires the company to cover
him against everything.
Under existing conditions, private com-
panies handling this business reserve the

Driving a low-slung sports model.
right to cancel or refuse any policy. This
being so, compulsion will almost cer-
tainly mean a demand for higher pre-
miums to cover the additional risk. But
close co-operation between police and in-
suring companies should remove this diffi-
culty.
It would do no harm if it were made
clear that a risk too great to be carried
by a reputable company was not a fit
and proper person to hold a driver’s
license.
There is another aspect that must be
given very serious consideration if any
compulsory scheme is to be made an
unqualified success —the safe, considerate
motorist should reap the benefit of his
care and consideration in the shape of
reduced premiums, while the foolhardy
must be made to pay for their omission.
To fulfil these conditions a flat rate
for first year’s premium should be fixed.
If no claim is made during that ye&r a
rebate of 15 per cent, should be allowed
on the second year’s premium ; on the
third year’s premium a rebate of 25
per cent., and on the fourth and subse-
quent years a rebate of 33 1-3 per cent.
Simple Way to Prevent Rattles.
Motorists driving cars of a venerable
age are, as a general rule, continually
worried by irritating rattles which are
set up in many cases in brake-conlrol
rods and steering connections, especially
where these are of the type in which the
rod is bent at right angles, passed through
a hole in the lever and secured with a
split pin.
It is not always convenient or even
worth the expense to rebush such holes
merely to restore a snug fit, but the
trouble can usually be effectively over-
come by stretching and looping a small
rubber band around the end of rod and
lever. Such a band is sufficiently flexible
to allow full movement of the joint, yet
it will keep the parts in close contact
and so prevent rattle.
The Trouble Lamp.
R.A. (Port Kembla, N.S.W.): Rear trans-
mission details are apparently in very bad order,
and unless new parts are fitted there is still
more trouble ahead. Price of crown wheel and
housing was fair if in good condition. Axles
should not have end play, and the distance
piece will at best be but a temporary expedi-
ent... .W.J.M. (Kogarah, N.S.W.): Jet sizes
for carburettor are correct, according to
maker’s instruction book. Possibly the choke
tube is in upside down or there is an exten-
sive induction air leak somewhere. Ignition
point is approximately correct... .R.S. (Bal-
gownie, N.S.W.): Manual posted as requested.
F.H. (Belmore, N.S.W.): Several modern cars
fit tin-plated pistons. Whether you can save
a rebore by plating old pistons is a matter for
experiment....D.G.C. (Wallendrie, Vic.): Un-
less a new panel is fitted there are only two
remedies. Either plug holes and refit screws
or fill the old holes with plastic wood before
inserting the screws again; allow 12 hours to
harden before using. If the hood is already
cracked and perished reconditioning is only a
waste of money except for appearance sake
K.B. (Wooloowin, Qld.): Every symptom
points to slack main in connecting-rod bear-
ings J.B.S. .(Normanhurst, N.S.W.): Colloi-
dal graphite can be obtained from any large
accessory house; one ounce to gallon of oil,
mixed before putting in sump....A. G. Hill

digo, Vic.): Standard and Hillman are both
down for test at an early date. Comparisons
can then be made E.McM. (Queanbeyan,
F.T.): The trouble is not inherent in this car;
it must be due to careless fitting or bad driving.
Fault can only be located by personal inspec-
tion. ... .C.A. (Hurlstone Park, N.S.W.): Round
belting will do temporarily but is a poor sub-
stitute for Whittle belt. Mid-week starting
won’t help matters. Rather check carefully
the ignition system and look for air leaks in

THE “WIDE-WORLD TWO” SHORT-WAVE
RECEIVER.
BY DON B. KNOCK.
The application of the electron-coupled detector in the “Wide-World Two”
receiver has been the basis of the three- and four-valve models previously
described. Here is a description of a two-valve receiver of proved efficiency.
Designed by the writer, it is of the “universal” type, in that it may be
used without alterations on A.C. or batteries with the same valves. The
short-wave listener will find the “Wide-World Two” gives strong signals
and easy tuning, and the experimental transmitter will find the stability of
the E-C detector of great advantage.
People without previous experience of
short-wave reception may think that a
vast array of valves is necessary to tune
in short-wave stations in England,
France, Germany, U.S.A. or elsewhere ;
but that is not so. The combination of
a superhet converter and broadcast re-
ceiver, or the complete all-wave super-
het, provides the medium whereby one
can operate controls and,
with good reception condi-
tions, sit back and listen, via
the loudspeaker, to a rea-
sonable measure of short-
wave entertainment. The
loudspeaker has the final
say.
It is as well not to let it
have its say in early-morn-
ing hours if one doesn’t
want to arouse domestic
wrath. The loudspeaker
faithfully reproduces every-
thing, including static and
the sudden bugle-blaring
rush of a high-speed auto-
matic Morse station. Before
the noise can be stopped it
has penetrated everywhere.
The big modern all-wave
superheterodyne receiver
does what it is intended to
do, but, unless the makers
have provided for a head-
phone connection, the in-
evitable loudspeakering has
its drawbacks. All signals
audible on the short-wave
bands may be heard com-
fortably and quietly with a
separate and relatively in-
expensive small receiver
with headphones. The tun-
ing procedure is a little dif-
ferent from the handling of
a superhet, but it is not by
any means difficult.
To meet the needs of
people who want something
in the nature of a small but
efficient short-wave receiver,
this “Wide-World Two”
emerged from the writer’s
laboratory as an example of
a thoroughly modern re-
generative two-valve re-
ceiver. There is no com-
parison between this and the
once-popular triode detector
and one (or two) audio type.
Advantages of the Electron-coupled
Detector.
A valve (triode or multi-element) may
be used in a variety of ways as a con-
trollable oscillating detector, and in many
years of receiver design the writer has
used all the methods. The E-C detector,
as used in the Wide-World Two,” is by
ar tne best Lack of stability is the
oremost trouble with the usual autodyne
etector, and if a detector suffers from
mnerent instability received signals
cannot be expected to be steady. “Creep-
ing” of the signals, or “wobbulation,”
makes the receiver difficult to handle.
With the introduction of the E-C detec-
tor, such undesirable features can be re-
duced to a minimum or eliminated.
77 and 38 Valves Permit “Universal” Use.
The 77 type of valve in the 6-volt
indirectly-heated series is admirably
Fig. 1—The “Wide-World Two” schematic circuit. A3B pentode is used in place of a 37 triode with
inti eased audio gain. If all-battery operation is desired, leave out the centre-tap heater resistor and
connect A- to B - direct.
suited to short-wave detection, and the
audio output of this is almost equal to
a sta B e of audio. With the addition of
a high-gain pentode in the audio stage
there is more than ample signal gain for
headphone use, and enough to operate a
loudspeaker on strong signals if desired,
The original receiver used a 37 triode
in the audio stage, but this has since been
changed to a 38 pentode, as illustrated in
the circuit diagram, with even better
results. These “auto” valves make it pos-
sible to use the receiver on A.C. for the
6-volt heaters and a power pack for the
plate voltages (a Philips 3002 eliminator
is excellent), or to run the heaters from
an accumulator and to use B batteries
for the plate voltage. With the receiver
working correctly, it is almost impossible
to tell the difference between power and
battery operation, hum being entirely
absent. Therefore the “Wide-World
Two” will do its job equally well any-
where, city or country.
The Circuit.
Since the original receiver was designed
one or two small improvements have
been effected. The circuit diagram is
shown in Fig. 1, and for the benefit of
the reader with comparatively little tech-
nical knowledge the reading of it has
been simplified by the pictorial repre-
sentation of components. The main fea-
tures are: Electron-coupled 77 detector
with grid-leak detection, regeneration
being controlled by the 50,000-ohm
potentiometer in the screening grid. This
potentiometer is virtually the heart of
the receiver, and it must be noiseless and
smooth in operation. The Stromberg-
Centralab type is insisted upon for good
results. The value of 50,000 ohms is not
essential. It can be anything up to
250,000 ohms. Wave-change is by plug-
in coils, and there is nothing against the
use of plug-in coils for a receiver of this
kind. Instead of using resistance coup-
ling in the plate of the detector, high-
impedance audio coupling is used. This
permits far better operation of the de-
tector, and contributes materially to the
audio gain.
The 38 pentode is cathode biased, and,
although a 700-ohm resistor is shown in
the diagram, this can be anything from
this value to 2000 ohms, but there will
be a reduction in audio gain with the
higher resistance. At the same time, plate
current drain will be reduced. This re-
sistor is by-passed by a 10-mfd. dry elec-
trolytic Ducon condenser.

The Efco type a.-w. (all-wave) dial is

the latest Efco Junior aero-type dial
would result in a very pleasing appear-
ance, coupled with ease of tuning.

ceiver for anything but a tuning con-
denser designed for the purpose, and not
merely an afterthought.
The “J. 8.” condenser, as recommended
for the “Wide-World Four” (B. 18/7/’34),
is a particularly good one, being designed
to eliminate rotor contact noises by the
insulation of the rotor from the frame.
The one used in the original receiver is
an R.C.S. .000175 mfd., which is quite
a sturdy make and smooth in operation.
For those who would like to include the
broadcast band in the tuning range the
special Efco split-stator condenser is par-
ticularly suitable. A small switch may
be fitted to cut in the extra capacity, and
thus use a coil for the broadcast range
with fewer turns than* are required for
coverage with .000175 mfd. The tuning
condenser is mounted on the base far
enough back to permit the mounting of
the dial behind the panel, in which the
aperture is cut for reading the indicator.
Amateur Bandspread Feature.
The circuit diagram shows, included in
series with the stator section of the tun-
ing condenser, another variable con-
denser with a switch to short this out.
This extra condenser is of very little use
to the listener- interested in short-wave
broadcasting alone, but is invaluable to
the amateur transmitter. This 23-plate
midget variable can be adjusted to spread
the amateur bands over more of the dial,
with consequent extra ease of tuning and
signal separation. Its inclusion merely
reduces the effective capacity across the
grid coil. If this condenser is not wanted,
it should be ignored in the diagram and
treated as if a line were drawrn straight
from the tuning condenser to the. top
of the grid coil. If it is used, it can be
mounted as close to the tuning condenser
as possible, together with the shorting
switch, on a strip of bakelite supported
by stand-off pillars. A better scheme is
that adopted by a reader, E. Maros
(Lismore, N.S.W.). The bandspread con-
denser is fitted with two plugs, so that it
can be plugged into sockets mounted on
bakelite. When
bandspread is not
wanted the con-
denser is removed
and a wire jumper
plugged into the
sockets.
The illustration
shows the receiver
viewed from the
rear. The 77 valve
is in the screen on
the right, the audio
valve on the left,
and the coil socket
and coil between.
The coil socket is
mounted above the
metal base on in-
sulating pillars
ljin. long. Behind
the audio valve is
the audio choke,
and the bandspread
condenser and
shorting switch are
behind the 77. The
telephone jack may
be seen projecting
at the left from
under the base,
and the battery (or
power) leads are
taken through a
rubber bush at the
rear. The regeneration potentiometer is
mounted directly underneath the tuning
control on the front panel, and the aerial
coupling condenser and aerial terminal
arc at the side of the base underneath
the 77 valve.
The 77 valve takes a six-pin socket
and the 38 a five-pin socket. The actual
connections may be seen from valve
charts, one of which is published.
With the exception of the grid condenser
and grid leak, all resistors, coupling con-
densers and by-pass condensers are
underneath the base, in the most
suitable positions for short wiring.
The centre-tapped heater resistor
is really only necessary for
A.C. on the valve heaters. It is
connected directly across either of the
two valve-socket heater-lugs, but if the
receiver is to be used on D.C. this re-
sistor should be omitted and the A nega-
tive connected to the B negative in the
usual way.
Fob A.C. use, a special Creela six-volt
two-amp C.T. transformer is available.
With this and a good B eliminator, com-
plete A.C. operation is had.

30-55 metres 12 4 * fin.

For use with the .000175 mfd. tuning
capacity a coil can be made for the
broadcast band having 155 turns of 36
D.S.C. for the grid and eight turns for the
cathode coils, but if the split-stator type
of condenser is used a standard 102-turn
32 enamelled coil, with an eight-turn
cathode coil, will be suitable.
The connections to the coils are exactly
as indicated by the circuit diagram. The
grid end of the grid coil is at the top
of the former, and the cathode end of.
the cathode coil is next to the earth (or
bottom end) of the grid coil.
In order that kits of parts may be
obtained, or even complete receivers,
Cohen and Burrows, Royal Arcade,
Sydney, are specialising in the “Wide-
World Two.” Operation of this receiver
is a sheer joy. All that is necessary is
commonsense in construction and observ-
ance of the time-honored injunction to
“keep all wiring as short and rigid as
possible.” If a large modern all-wave
superhet will reproduce the Daventry or
This new Efco dial is recommended
as particularly suitable for the “Wide-
World Two.” It is the “Aero Junior”
model. The speed ratio is 9-1, and a
special anti-backlash spring device keeps
tension in one direction. The drive is
the well-known Efco wedge-motion, and
is smooth in action. The gears are highly
accurate, being machine-cut and not
merely stamped. With this smooth and
free from lag motion, the “Aero Junior”
dial is excellent for short-wave tuning.
Paris programmes well, so will this re-
ceiver, and probably even better in pro-
portion. It is easier to render intelligible
the weakest of signals with a sensitive
and stable regenerative receiver, even
though it may be by headphones. But
headphones have their advantages, as re-
ferred to previously.
As for the aerial, it should be unneces-
sary to adjure the reader to use the best
he possibly can. It need not be hun-
dreds of feet long, nor need it be strung
at some inconvenient height. Good in-
sulation and clearance from surrounding
objects are the essentials.
The “Wide-World Two” does not cost
much to make, and if it is properly con-
structed it is a means of unlimited hours
of enjoyment. But if it is “thrown
together” it will be no better than the
next “haywire” job.

THE RENAISSANCE OF STORY-
TELLING.
The art of oral story-telling, which
had been declining ever since Caxton
started a printery, is being developed
again for the purposes of broadcast en-
tertainment. It is not yet as well done
as it might be, but it is already probably
the most widely popular feature (outside
the cricket scores) of the daily fare pro-
vided by city stations. Most widely
popular because even people who have
“no ear for music” like stories. Best
and most steadily occupied of the Aus-
tralian practitioners is Tal Ordell (2BL
Sydney). From Mondays to Fridays he
tells (or reads) a short story at 9 a.m.
and 2.30 p.m. ; on Saturdays, in the
morning only. That involves finding 11
new stories every week, whereas, if
mediaeval records speak truly, the pro-
fessional raconteurs of the days when
literature was left to the clergy seldom
troubled to add that many to their reper-
toire in a year.
Ordell eschews both very well-known
and very recently-published stories, but
despite that he maintains, week in and
week out, a good literary standard, while
the stories he purveys are only very occa-
sionally recognised as old friends by the
most omnivorous fiction-readers. His
stage experience, of course, stands him in
good stead. He knows how to present
effectively a dramatic climax, a good joke,
or a pathetic situation. But all actors

are not good raconteurs, and Ordell’s
literary bent is probably his best asset
not only in the matter of telling stories,
but in selecting them.
As well known as Ordell, and also a
very accomplished yarn-spinner, is Cap-
tain Stevens of 2UE, but he seldom
indulges in fiction. He is an avid student
of biography, and his Sunday afternoon
sketches of great literary personages have
contained much which, though quite true,
was new to most of his hearers.
A considerable amount of story-telling
talent has been brought forward for the
children’s sessions. 2FC Sydney has its
“Elizabeth” and “Shere Khan”; 2HD
Newcastle is generally good for a well-
told fairy story, and 7ZL Hobart is
equipped with “Polly Flinders” and
“Judy.” The gag to a recent Bulletin
drawing in which a sedate elderly couple
reprove their son for making a row be-
cause they want to listen to “Jack and
the Beanstalk” hit the truth very closely
concerning the interest taken by older
folk in the broadcast fare intended for
their youngsters. Sick folk, too tired to
read, find the voice of the radio story-
teller a refreshing companion, and for
their sake alone this feature is well
worth while. But the art of story-telling
is only in the first blush of its renaissance,
and it is hardly recognised as an art.
Possibly in a few years’ time it will stand
so high that its virtuosos will command
the respect (and the emoluments)
accorded to a Paderewski or a Melba.
Whether that happens or not will de-
pend upon the tale-spinners. They have
a great opportunity.
A. D. W.
Casual Comment.
There are wholesalers who should
realise that any old substitute will not
do for the man in the country, particu-
larly where short-wave receivers are con-
cerned. A Bulletin reader, regarding
the “Wide-World Three” (B. 20/6/’34):
After reading your letter I examined the
all-wave switch and found that it was of
another make, and not the one you re-
commended in the article. My dealer
orders from a concern .in Sydney,
and every order I have given has been
unsatisfactory in some respect. In this
case, I also ordered the Centralab poten-
tiometer you insist upon for good results,
and they sent one of another make which
is little more than useless.
This is typical of other complaints. The
wholesaler is not alone to blame. The
country dealer should take more interest
in his customer’s requirements than to
accept substitute goods.
Latest in the Trade.
Ducon Condenser Pty., Ltd., have
placed on the market new electrolytic
condensers, a group of which is here-
with illustrated. Type 22 is designed for
mounting underneath the chassis of a
radio receiver, and consists of two 8-mfd.
condensers rated at 500 peak volts. This
unit is thus a space-saver. Type 80 is a
tubular model of standard size and
8-mfd. capacity fitted with the familiar
and extremely convenient centre-screw
fixing and rated at 500 peak volts. The
larger tubular model, type 81, is particu-
larly noteworthy. This is an 8-mfd. con-
denser with an 800 peak voltage rating,
and is continuously safe at 600 volts. Ex-
perimental transmitters should find this
type useful, 600 volts for the plate supply
to a 25-watt transmitter being a fair
average.
What’s What in Radio.
Nazi Germany gives short measure to
listener pirates. People convicted of
using receivers without a license go
behind bars for three weeks.

Greece claims a youth with the ability
to light valves and lamps by merely rub-
bing them between the palms of his
hands. An ideal person to take along on
an outing with a portable receiver. No

A transmitting amateur in England
thought out a bright scheme for keeping
his aerial wire clean and bright. Radia-
tion and reception are much better with
a clean-surfaced wire than one dirty and
corroded, and the idea is thus worthy of
attention generally.
A large-size cotton-
bobbin was cut in
half lengthwise. The
hole through the
centre was lined
with emery-cloth,
the two halves
screwed together and
an aluminium wheel
with a series of
vanes resembling a
windmill fastened at
one end. A washer
was slipped on the wire at each end to
prevent the bobbin jambing
against the aerial insulators.
On windy days the wheel
assembly travels up and
down the length of the aerial
and thus keeps the surface
of the wire clean. The only
possible snag is the tempta-
tion to small boys with pea-
rifles.

The output from the secondary is a good
sin. spark. After having been rectified by a
Philips 5605, if the output is taken through the
secondary of an old audio transformer the
current appears to be alternating, as I can still
get a jin. spark. Would it be necessary to
use extra filtering to obtain pure D.C. ? —B6.
Remember that you are using half-wave
rectification and that, unless filtering is very
complete, there will be a large amount of
ripple left. This residual pulsating D.C. is
responsible for the apparent A.C. output you
get. If you intend using this eliminator for
a receiver, full-wave rectification and perfect
filtering are necessary.
7 am commencing as an amateur transmitter,
and wish to build a fairly efficient ’phone trans-
mitter. Would appreciate a few suggestions.
—Bl.
Firstly, get the A.R.R.L. Handbook (Swains,
Ltd., Pitt-street, Sydney); secondly, start off
with a crystal-controlled transmitter. A very
fine telephony transmitter can be made,, by
using a 59 pentode as oscillator-doubler and
a 59 as amplifier, with suppressor-grid modu-
lation. The only modulator valve needed is
a low-power triode feeding the suppressor-grid.
A complete transmitter of this type was de-
scribed in “QST” for May, 1934. The circuit
diagram illustrated also shows an excellent
type of transmitter for amateur telephony.
The list of parts is as follows:
LI, L 2 and L 3, all identical. For 80 metres
should be 25 turns on 2iin. form, space wound.
L 4, depends on aerial; Tl, microphone trans-
former; T 2, any good-grade audio transformer;
CH, centre tapped 180 ma. choke, 30 to 60
henries; M.A., 0-150 ma. milliammeter; Rl,
50,000 ohms; R 2, volume control, 200,000
ohms; R 3, 2500 ohms; R 4, 100 ohms; R 5,
30,000 ohms; R 6, 15,000 ohms; R 7, 5000
ohms; Cl, .01 mfd.; C 2, .5 to 2 mfd.; C 3,
.00015 to .00035 variable; C 4, .000025 vari-
able (neutralising); Jl, J 2, J 3, J 4, J 5, meter
jacks.

Under the Whip
Though Melbourne people grumbled
at the poorness of the Australian Hurdle
and Australian Steeple fields, the time
record in each event was broken. Laniroi
brought the hurdle figures down from
6min. s|sec. to 6min. 2sec. ; Redditch
took Hsec. off the record he made 12
months before. The Red Dennis geld-
ing is held on lease from A. L. Yuillc,
keeper of the Australian Stud Book,
whose grandfather won the first Cham-
pion Stakes with Flying Buck. As the
earnings of Redditch • now aggregate
£7702, Loddon Yuille must have received
a very substantial sum.
Redditch carried only a pound short
of 13st. His burden was 131 b. less than
Redleap scored with in 1892, but Red-
leap took Bmin. 45fsec. for four miles ;
Redditch covered miles in 6min.
53|sec. In other words, F. W. Hoysted’s
champion could have equalled Red-
leap’s time for the longer journey
by traversing half a mile in lmin.
52-}sec. And Hynes did not give
his mount free rein until a mile from
home. He afterwards said that never
before had he ridden a horse that pulled
at the end of 2\ miles. Tracks admittedly
are faster than they were four decades
ago, but Redditch jumped as many fences
as Redleap did. In the opinion of Hynes

he is a stone better horse at Caulfield
than at Flemington.
They were a poor lot of horses that
finished behind him, but this did not
detract from the brilliance of the 13-to-8-
on favorite. Jack’s Jason (second in
request at 7 to 1 in a field of six) had
not raced since he landed the Warrnam-
bool Grand Annual two years ago. He
earned £l5O for running third simply by
jumping safely at little better than hunt-
ing pace..
For his ill-luck with Etymology in the
Australian Hurdle, H. E. Connolly was
compensated when the son of Analogy
annexed the Arkaringa Hurdle in record
time for the course. Because of a good
mile gallop during the week Mount
Dangar shared favoritism with Poitreux.
Mount Dangar knocked up five furlongs
from home after helping Taciturn to
make the pace.
Three-year-olds were tested over a
mile in the Chatsworth Plate, run in two
divisions. Red Ray, favorite for the first
bunch, did well to finish third after being
interfered with early to such an extent
that he was near the tail of the field
with five furlongs to go. The winner,
Beautaur, cost only 35gns. as a yearling.
He carried top weight (9st. 31b.), took
charge early and won easily. Takata
ran away with the second division at
14 to 1. He is a grey, and was bred by
J. P. Arthur, who won a Metropolitan
with Cragford. Like Cragford, he is by
Eastern Monarch, and takes after his
dam, Ruby Agnes, in color.
Holt expected to win the Balaclava
Stakes with Picatus, first up, on Satur-
day. The Magpie gelding went out at
5 to 2. He put up a good .fight, but
may have needed a run, and was nar-
rowly beaten for third money. Sordino
(12 to 1) helped Takata to enrich Mc-
Shortodds. Beaten previously in most
moderate company, this five-year-old
stallion put in an overpowering run in the
straight to win by three-quarters of a
length from the unreliable Noel Soldat.
Jack Donohoe made his presence felt
in Melbourne soon after arrival from
Sydney by finishing second in the St.
Aubin Welter at Caulfield with Dermid.
He scratched Burlesque, and made a
fairly substantial plunge on the Tippler
gelding. Dermid accounted for every
rival but the favorite, Sir Simper, who
had too big a pull in the weights. Dermid
and Burlesque are almost certain to pay
their way in Melbourne.

Epsom and Metropolitan candidates
in Kuvera, Limarch, Johnnie Jason,
Regal Son, Roman Spear and Multigris
figured at Rosehill on Saturday, and
some were fancied. All failed. Kuvera’s
fifth in the Dundas Handicap, first
division, was the best showing. He
had 9st. 51b., more weight than he
will carry in the Epsom, Metrop.
and Caulfield Cup, and his jockey wisely
did not knock him about when he had
no hope of catching the brilliant Le
Touquet (7 to 1), who led throughout
and beat Some Boy and Frimsel easily,
with Roman Spear fourth. Le Touquet
is in the Epsom with 6st. 121 b., but there
is a doubt about his running a solid mile.
Bim Boy (7 td 2) made hacks of the
opposition in the second division. He
had not sported silk for nearly three
years. A big chestnut son of Green-
stead, trained by Jack King, he jumped
into the lead at barrier-rise, and the rest
was a procession. Kagal and Anchor
chased the runaway. The favorite, King
Moab, would not gallop despite Darby
Munro’s efforts over the last half-mile.
Randwick trainer Eiver Walker is re-
gretting that his charge Jonker is not in
the Metropolitan or the two Cups. He
put up a meritorious performance in the
Rosehill Handicap, for which his price
was 6 to 1. Jonker appeared to be out
of it turning for home, but when Knox
drew the whip the ex-Maorilander put
in such long ones that he beat Cylanta
handily, with Headgale third. He was
sold by Jamieson to Walker for 100
guineas. The favorite, Measure, gave
an inglorious display, dropping out of
the race at the turn. Perhaps he could
not manage the going, which was soft in
places.
Somebody missed a bargain when
King’s Head was passed in at the yearling
sales for 30 guineas. He won the Three-
year-old at 14 to 1, giving the bookies
a clean sheet. Povertdale, the favorite,
got hemmed in and had to be checked.
However, he would have had no chance
with King’s Head, who beat him point-
less in the run home. Booth’s filly,
Pavarti, was third.
Canegrass (6 to 4) was too solid for
the Derby candidate Duke Caledon in
the Wentworthville Stakes. The favorite
commenced smartly, and was always
going easily in front. Sarcherie showed
promise by running third ; Contact dis-
appointed.
Pike was seen at this best on Tatyoon
(2 to 1) in the Parramatta Mile. Half-
way down the straight he allowed his
mount to move off the rails, but when
Bold Boy dashed through he quickly
closed the gap, and Tatyoon won easilv,
with Captain Rado in third place. A
protest was dismissed.
St. Globe (10 to 1) and Verberry (2 to
1) won their heats of the Maiden in easy
fashion. St. Globe lost his form after
running third in the Breeders’ Plate ; he
may still come good with age and racing.
Verberry, owned by Victorian Frank
Robinson, got a nice run on the rails all
the way. He beat a poor lot, but is
open to improvement. He is by Sol
Green’s horse Verbius from Foxberry.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
A Russian, Lurich, and a Bulgarian,
Penchiff (14st. 41b.), wrestled for the
“Australian” championship at Leich-
hardt. It went nine rounds ; then Lurich
gained the deciding fall with a forward-
slam and a body-press. Tommy Nilan,
who has met both, defeated George
Calvas in a supporting match. He is an
Australian.
Footbrawl
Saturday’s game between South A us.
and Vic. at Melbourne proved a dud.
Fielding almost the same 18 that had
walloped the Cabbage Gardeners by 11
points in June, the Croweaters found
themselves quite outclassed. In marking,
long kicking, position play and pace they
were inferior ; but, above all, they failed
to back up, either through under-training
or under-coaching. The 17,800 who
contributed £720 wanted, above all, to
see a close finish, and were sold a pup.
At the first change-over the Dark Blues
owned 60 points to S. Australia’s 13 ; on
resuming latter scored three quick goals,
but after that were out of the picture.
At lemon-time the Vic.s held 148 points
to 66. Then they concentrated on feed-
ing S. Melbourne’s full forward, Nash,
so that he might smash the inter-State
and Vic. League records, which he did —
with 18 goals. Full scores: Vic., 30 goals,
19 behinds, 199 points; S.A., 14-10,
94 points. The aforesaid Nash, Shea,
Bunton, La Fontaine and Regan stood
out for Vic., while Quinn, Hender and
Dermody for S. Aus. did most to avert
the tragedy.
* * * *
Australia beat M.L. fc>y 25-11 at Sydney
Cricket Ground on Saturday before a
crowd of over 33,000 —the largest Union
gate since 1908. It was a fitting com-
memoration of the R.U.’s diamond jubi-
lee in Australia. M.L. has now fourteen
wins to seven by Australia, and one
match has been drawn. The All-Black
tally is 339 points ; Australia’s, 204.
Only selected on the previous Sunday,
with eight of the players drawn from
Victoria and Queensland, the Australians
had little time for more than a ground
practice, and their opening form was a
bit ragged. M.L. had a lead of 11-6
at half-time. However, signs of combina-
tion began to show up in the home side
when a great movement sent McLean
over. As the second half began it was
apparent that the jigsaw was fitting to-
gether. The Maorilanders fought bitterly
to gain the upper hand as the truth began
to dawn on them. Gradually the home
team took command, and at full-time had
an ascendancy over the visitors in every
department of the game, even the famous
All-Black forwards being helpless to
stem the tide —a mighty rare experience
for them.
In the second half Bonis quelled Hadley
as a hooker, and in line-outs and rucks
the giant Victorians, Bridle and Dunlop,
more than held their own. The packing
of the 3-4-1 scrum was far sounder on the
Australian side, the All-Black back-row
man resolving himself, as was expected
(B. l/8/’34), into our old friend the wing-
forward. In the loose the All-Blacks had
the better of the opening stages, but faded
out noticeably as the game went on.
Hodgson played an inspired game in ruck
and loose for the winners, though the
forwards were difficult to separate.
McKenzie, Knight, H. McLean and Man-
chester were a splendid nucleus to the
defeated pack.
The Australian back division was
superior at all points. Ross, playing the
game of his life, made the temperamental
Collins look second-class. Our wingers,
D. McLean and Kelaher, outshone Bul-
lock-Douglas and Hart in attack and
defence, McLean in particular giving a
wonderful exhibition. Towers at outside
centre benefited greatly by two inside
backs like Hayes and Lewis. Well served
by Malcolm they made openings for the
Randwick man time and again, and
thoroughly accounted for the M.L. in-
sides. Caugliey was again the best of
these, Page, with the cares of captaincy
on him, failing to master the opposition.
Corner, substituted for the injured Kilby
behind the scrum, showed himself a
pocket champion.
With a bit of luck, the winning score
should have been larger, two Australian
tries being disallowed. As it was, Towers
(2), Bridle and McLean crossed. Ross
converted two tries and added three p.gs.
Hore, Knight and Max scored for M.L.,
Collins converting one try. Referee
Cooney made a fine game of it. In one
sense his job was easy, since not an in-
stance of bad temper marred the match.
Rugby League grade matches in
Sydney saw Western Suburbs win the
minor premiership from Eastern by 7-2.

Woodfull’s Men
The Australians got a taste of real
leg-theory against Nottingham when
Voce, with seven leg fielders, took 8
wickets for 66 on a pitch recovering from
rain, the tourists reaching 237. Wood-
full again batted impressively for 81,
while Chipperfield also put up a con-
fident 57. Bradman and Oldfield were
out of the Australian team; Larwood
did not turn out for the county. Notts
had lost 1 for 42 at stumps.
* * * St
England has picked 14 men for the all-
important final Test, which begins at the
Oval on Saturday. They are: Wyatt,
Sutcliffe, Walters, Hammond, Hendren,
Leyland, Ames, Allen, Verity, Bowes,
Gover, Clark, Peebles and Gregory.
Gregory and Gover are two Surrey men
who did well against us earlier in the
season, Gover with his fast bowling,
Gregory with most consistent batting. ~
(Continued on page 36.)
The Australians made a good show-
ing at the Empire Games with eight
wins, to say nothing of placings. But
Metcalfe’s inability to capture the long
and high jumps after a fine start with the
hop, step and jump was a disappoint-
ment, especially as he failed by inches
to reach his Australian figures. Ryan
retained his 1500 metres and 440 yards
swimming titles, and as he won the 400
yards in Canada last year he now holds
three Empire titles. Claire Dennis also
scored in the 200 yards breaststroke, the
Olympic champion hoisting an Empire
record, as Ryan did in his two swims.
Our two wrestlers each won in his class,
Knight taking the heavyweight division
and Garrard the lightweight. Cyclist
Gray won the 1000-metre time trial,
and Cook the lightweight boxing.

“Ike Mcßagg”: Consider the horrible
case of the pore Adelaide bookmakers.
The Betting Control Board reports that
to June 2 punters put £1,304,068 in the
bag and took out £1,184,262 in winnings,
turnover tax and stamp duty making the
total £1,281,442. It doesn’t need a trained
accountant to see that only £22,626 was
left to be divided among the 362 bagmen
practising in the State, • the handout
averaging £63 a head. But they didn’t
all get that; 227 made £159 each. The
down-trodden remainder came out with a
dead loss of £96 a man. That ought to
squelch the fairy tales about limousines,
bediamonded shirt-fronts and peroxided
damsels that hang about the struggling
fielder.
The AJ.C. balance sheet for the year
ending June 30 shows a surplus of in-
come over outgoings of £2037, this after
allowing £19,734 for depreciation on
totalisators, buildings and plant. It is
an improvement on the figures for the
past three years. In 1931 there was a
deficit of £26,000. Next year the debit
had dropped to £6347. In 1933 a surplus
of £1931 showed the corner to be turned.
Admission money was the chief revenue.
At £93,563 this was £II,OOO better than
the previous year’s gates, leaving out the
small figures. Prize money had to be
cut from £87,574 to £81,084, but the com-
ing spring meeting will see an increase of
£3600.
“Holy City”: Ipswich (Q.) Amateur
T.C. has the bailiffs in. For a long time
the club has been behind with its pay-
ments to the Taxation Commissioner.
The other day this authority took over
all the cash standing in its name. That
left the committee with no brass to
pay the prizes at the meeting then in
progress, and the hapless committemen
had to personally guarantee their bank
,£or a bit of accommodation. The Q.T.C..
is to be appealed to for help, and, of
course, the Government. The State
Auditor-General is asking for the balance
sheets for the past two years, failing
which he is going to have the books and
accounts officially quizzed.
“Sefton Park”: Though the favorite
won, the Liverpool Grand National spelt
disaster to many of his backers. A
special express left Paddington for Liver-
pool on the morning of the race. Enter
to the punters a demure and lovely
damsel, all in black, who handed every-
one a card headed “Bet in Comfort.”
She worked her way back through the
train, taking wagers and giving tickets,
the while she explained that settling
would occur on the return journey.
Many of the passengers were solid win-
ners, and waited expectantly after the
train started for the demure damsel. She
never turned up, and a check of the seat
bookings showed that one passenger had
missed the train. The cruellest stab came
when the punters inspected the gilt-
edged tickets. The telegraphic address
of the mythical Regent-street firm of
bookmakers was “Gladovit.”
Woodfull’s Men
Rain brought the Australians’ match
with Glamorgan to a draw —the- 13th
of the tour. Closing with 7 down for
440, the tourists dismissed the Anglo-
Welsh for 112, O’Reilly taking 7 for
37 on a sticky wicket. Following on, the
home side did better, and had lost only
5 for 198 at the close. Smart, a profes-
sional all-rounder, top-scored for Glamor-
gan with 75. O’Reilly’s bag this time was
4-41.
The Australia-Warwickshire match was
another weather washout. Australia
made 221 on a sticky wicket, Oldfield
(34) and Grimmett (38 n. 0.) saving a rout.
Mayer and Croom took 4 wickets
each for 75 and 33 respectively. War-
wickshire reached 179, Croom (51) and
Santall (61) making most of them. Wyatt
got only 9. Grimmett (5-76) and Ebeling
(3-19) did the damage. Australia had lost
4 for 185 when rain drew the match.
McCabe (77) and Darling (50) headed the
scoring.

“Kennington’: Marylebone has con-
sented to shorten the hours of play
in the fifth Test at the Oval, and they
will now be from 11.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m.
Australians have objected for a long
time to the customary 11 a.m. start save
on the first day. As this game is to be
played out and may run a week, the
change will probably be appreciated by
both sides, especially as the weather is
frizzling and promises to remain like that.

“Coif”: A quaint yarn of the second
Test comes from England. A Select
Committee of the House of Lords was
considering an important bill. All were
dying to know what the Australians had
scored in reply to England’s first innings
of 440. The atmosphere of such a com-
mittee was too sacrosanct for a clear
statement on the subject, but a barrister
who was examining a witness had a
brainwave as his clerk brought him in
a note. Said he to the witness, with
whom he was disagreeing, “My point is
that it would be just as wrong to say
the Australians were 285 all out when,
AUSTRALIANS IN THE MATCH AGAINST M.L.

5, Hodgson (N.S.W.); 6, Jessep (V.); 7, McLean (0.); 8, Bonis (Q.);
9, Birmingham (Q.).
as a matter of fact, their score was 284.”
A general sigh of relief went round the
room.
Footbrawl
“Fitzcray”: Vic. League and Associa-
tion are to hold a meeting to consider
a suggestion that the rival bodies
should affiliate and that each Association
club be hooked up with a League club
—on the lines of the “linked battalions”
of the Imperial Army. There are other
proposals, but the king hit seems to be
the classification of all senior players,
with duplicate “dossiers” of their per-
formances. to be filed under a
reference number for each player to
aid the maintenance of secrecy. No sug-
gestion of taking finger-prints has been
made; but a lad's boot-prints might be
attached to his “dossier.” Identification
of the gentleman who kicked the umpire
in the fight to reach the dressing-room
ahead of the woman with the hatpin
would then be a mere matter of routine.
* * * *
“Huon”: One of the sorrows of the
minor Australian States addicted to the
national football code is the periodic
ravishing of their pet piglings by
the Big, Bad Victorian Wolf. Protests
have been vain, and to-day most of the
big Melbourne League clubs contain a
considerable percentage of players
“recruited” from other States. The Tassie
League, which has suffered more than
most, rose in wrath the other day, and
resolved that all the States outside Vic-
toria be circularised regarding the
“piracy” of players and invited to help
in fighting the practice. Victoria is to
be asked whether it is not a fair thing
to come to an agreement to regulate the
transfer of players from other States and
to stick to it —“gentlemen’s agreements”
have been made on other occasions.
* * * *
“Der Jong”: Someone said in my pre-
sence the other day that football re-
quired a high standard of intelligence
from its votaries —meaning players. I
suppose that is so, but on being appealed
to for a verdict I could only cite the case
of the most intelligent footballer I have
met. He was a famous sprinter who had
come to South Africa with an overseas
team years ago. We took him out on
the high veld near Heidelberg, which was
then full of buck for a bit of shooting,
As we got out of our Cape cart, an
orabi gazelle jumped up under the feet
of our sprinter. With a wild yell he cast
rifle and impedimenta aside and made
after the fleeing buck. The orabi is
credited with being able to cut out any-
thing up to 50 m.p.h., but the enthusiast
kept up the chase for a couple of hun-
dred yards. By the time it had dawned
on him that he had no hope the gazelle
must have been somewhere near Vereeni-
ging.
“Senex”: What has become of the
“honor cap” which was once awarded to
international, inter-State and even club
players in the long ago? In the old
country, the R.U. men are still spoken
of as being “capped” if they gain inter-
national selection. I doubt if the cap
is still handed out there or here. In any
case, it is many years since I have seen
members of visiting teams walking the
streets with ornate contraptions of velvet
and gold or silver braid topping their
craniums, much less going on the field
wearing the things. Once it was de rigueur
when the photograph of a team was
taken that each man should wear his
“honor cap.” Nowadays there isn’t a
sign of the things in the pictures. Writer
recalls a noted English international who
took up his abode in Queensland and
fell upon evil days. Everybody’s friend
but his own, he persisted in wearing,
whenever he appeared in public, his “Eng-
land” cap and a tailed morning-coat that
he had brought from home. The velvet
of the cap grew greasy, and the metal
braid wore to filaments ; the coat became
greener yeaj- by year. I was far away
when news of his death reached me.
Knowing the old lad well, 1 hope they
buried him in his uniform.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Brassey”: Australian golf looks like
suffering from an embarrassment of
riches in the near future. The cables
say that, in addition to the official team
of amateurs, headed by Michael Scott,
two of Britain’s best-known pros, are
corning along, presumably playing for
their own hand. They are Padgham and
Alliss. Padgham has won the British pro-
fessional championship among many
other first-class achievements. Alliss has
a European reputation, for it was he
who established golf in Germany after
the war as professional at the Berlin
club. German and French champion
ships stand to his credit.

“Lakeside”: The Australians respon-
sible having sportingly asked the Yank
professional golfers’ organisation to pick
the team of six to visit Australia, the
Americans have responded with a tenta-
tive dozen of the men ready to come. The
final six looks like being Dutra, Armour,
Horton Smith, Craig Wood, Densmore
Shute and Paul Runyan. "Sarazen and
Kirkwood are coming over on their own,
of course. Dutra is open champion of
the U.S.A. Armour is a Scot and a
winner of the British and Canadian open
championships. Shute won the British
open in 1933, after a tie with Craig
Wood. Runyan holds the U.S.A. profes-
sional title. Horton Smith is ranked in
America as the finest player produced
since Walter Hagen.

“Marino”: Mrs. G. de Crespigny,
, winner of the women’s golf champion-
ship of South Australia, only tackled the
game in earnest three years ago, when she
joined Royal Adelaide. After collecting
a few junior and handicap events the
lady walked off with the Royal Adelaide
Championship of 1931, and topped that
by running up to Mrs. Britten-Jones in
the final for the State title that year. A
trip to Britain in 1932 put further polish
on the new champion’s golf, and to-da>
she is one of the most attractive stylists
among South Australian associates.

“Baffy”: Challenges to Kirkwood and
Sarazen have started already. The defi.
has been issued by W. Bolger, of Oat-
lands Club, and J. H. Cohen, of Parra-
matta, and the stake is £lOO a side. The
match will be played on the Blacktown
(N.S.W.) course, where some years ago
Hagen and Kirkwood were defeated by
W. Bolger and A. Downs. This win did
a lot for golf in the district, and the
coming game should drag a fat gate.

ERE’S a very simple way ro prove the outstanding value of the
1934 Standard Nine. Just imagine you were choosing a car
double its price and decide what equipment you would look for.
You’d want four doors, six windows, leather upholstery, Buoyant
Power, Synchro-mesh gears (in top, third and' second). You’d
insist on an X-braced frame, on Luvax Hydraulic Shock Absorbers,
on Silent-bloc Shackles and on powerful four-wheel brakes. Those
are the features of which big, expensive cars are proud. Those are
the features you get in this Standard Nine Saloon for £289.
Combined with this equipment goes real beauty —the
beauty of low, sweeping lines achieved up to now only in long-
wheelbase models. And PERFORMANCE —performance that, if
described here, might sound exaggerated, but will astound you
when actually experienced.
Why not have a trial drive to-day and learn how this year’s English
Standard NINE has combined small-car economy with big-car
luxury. ’Phone your Standard dealer now.
T.he NINE is one of four models available in the 1934 line of English
Standards. See this fine range and you’ll find the car you want at
the price you "want to pay.

“Rev. Knucklebone”: After the
moderate display of our Davis Cuppers
in Europe, the Australian L.T.A. is said
to be considering challenging again next
year. It seems to me, as an unbiased
observer, that a challenge until we have
built up another team is a waste of
money. Crawford has had a fine innings,
but no punter would back him now to win
a match against a third-class player even
if he defeats a topsider in a previous
game. Travelling en famille, as he in-
sists on doing, he is an expensive pro-
position into the bargain. He has ad-
mittedly ceased to be a doubles player
since he and Hopman parted company.
McGrath should be taken out west and
set to dig postholes for a couple
of years. The pursuit is a great
developer of character, and press blah
will not reach him there. Quist is a
doubles player pure and simple, though
a good one —a partner will have to be
found for him. Turnbull automatically
goes into the discard, of course.
* * * *
“Heeby-Jeeby”: The Davis Cup final
didn’t pass without the usual newspaper
comment on Perry’s antics. One critic
says that his court manners are “still ques-
tionable” and that he “repeatedly glared”
at officials after what he thought wrong
decisions, the performance being in
marked contrast to the unemotional con-
duct of Shields. One of his defenders
protests that Perry is unaware that the
crov/ds “who admire his play deplore his
antics.” That is not so. After his last
exhibition in Sydney he gave a local
paper an interview which was about as
contrite an apology as anyone could
expect. The crowd on that occasion gave
him very clearly to understand that it
“deplored his antics,” and the English-
man had the sense to know when to
climb down.
“Hotham”: After hanging back for
some time, overseas tennis players desir-
ing to come to the Melbourne centenary
show are breezing in like homing bees.
The latest are Stoeffen and Lott, the U.S.
doubles pair who were undefeated at
Wimbledon and in the Davis Cup this
year. Perry and Hughes (England),
Kirby and Malcolm (S. Africa), Stefani
(Italy), Menzel (Czecho-S.) and Maier
(Spain) have already accepted ; so have
the Misses Round, Lyle and Dearman—
all English.
Miscellaneous
“Charlotte’s Pass”: This contradictory
country, which most folk abroad imagine
to be a burned-up desert area infested
with politicians, goannas and Caledon
blacks, held its annual snow sports last
week in the Kosciusko range country.
The outstanding event of the meeting was
the Slalom championship. The men’s title
was won by T. Mitchell, of Victoria.
The women’s end went to Mrs. Tinsley,
also a Cabbage Gardener. Outstanding
was the performance of 14-year-old W.
Pattinson, second to Mitchell. Like his
brother, J. Pattinson, who finished in
fourth place, he comes from Kiandra,
where the kids don skis before they are
promoted to breeks.
* * * *
Neville Quinn, whose death in South
Africa at 26 has been reported, was a
very well-liked member of that team of
sportsmen which toured Australia in
1931-32 and, if it didn’t win Test
matches, made itself one of the most
popular ever to visit this country. Tall
and with a beautiful action, he was a
left-hand bowler of parts, and in all first-
class matches for the tour took 42
wickets at an average of 23.90, though he
suffered severely at the hands of his slip
fieldsmen.
* * * *
Leslie Minnett, killed in a motor acci-
dent near Sydney, was one of a trio of
notable athletic brothers, all of them
cricketers out of the common. In addi-
tion to being a fine bowler, he was a fair
bat, and, like his brothers, he represented
N.S.W. in Sheffield matches, in which he
took 14 wickets at an average of 23,
while his batting average was 16 for 8
innings. For N.S.W. against A. O.
Jones’s team of 1907-08 he took 9
wickets for 223. Like his brothers also, he
was unlucky in playing at a time when
Australia had an embarrassment of high-
class cricketers. From cricket he turned
to golf, and made a success of that also.
* * * *
“Cage”: That reference to the coming
English croquet teaih (B. 1/ 8 / ’34) re-
minds me that the austere London “Morn-
ing Post” has been discussing the matter
frivolously. After making the rather
curious statement that, whereas croquet
is ignored by the English public, in Aus-
tralia “the contest for the croquet ashes
is hot news,” the journal considers that
its unpopularity at home is due to the
fact that it is “at once so provocative and
prohibitive of profanity.” Writer has
watched lots of croquet and never noted
a happening calculated to rouse the ire
even of the retired colonels who so
greatly affect it. Just as well, perhaps, for,
if one of the game’s exponents did run
amuck with the very heavy mallets which
are part of the paraphernalia, the
casualty list would be a serious one.

Activities of a “Trust Group”
Early in 1933 the prospectus of South-
ern British National Trust was circulated
in Sydney. It was reviewed in The Bul-
letin of February 15, 1933, as follows:
™ ncern has a nominal share capital
01 «00,000; it is now asking for £5,000,000
m £lO debentures for investment in stock-
exchange and other securities. Capital is
in 400,000 ss. ords. and 400,000 6 p.c. cum.
prefs. of £1 each, participating with the ords.
«p to 10 Pf- Of the scrip, 375,000 ords. and
-50,000 prefs. are also on offer. How much
capital is actually subscribed and paid up is
not stated, but £lOO,OOO has been mentioned,
and the co. claims to have bought the “Daily
telegraph” building, King-street, Sydney.
The directors are W. A. Pilkington, O. M.
Hope, H. H. Pollard and J. W. S. McArthur
(managing); they also constitute the board of
the Investment Executive Trust of N.Z., Ltd-
registered in Maoriland in May, 1929. The
Southern British Co. was registered in N. S.
Wales last month. The plan of finance
adopted in both cos. is strikingly similar to the
bond” method, inasmuch as share capital is
small, shareholders look for profits mainly by
way of a percentage on the earnings of the
debentures, and debenture-holders shoulder
most of the risks.
ln view of the magnitude of the Austra-
lian co. s proposed operations, and the fact
that the directors are not well known in Aus-
traha, the incorporation of the results and
financial position of the Maoriland co. would
have made the prospectus more impressive.
If such figures are made available to in-
tending investors, and they are satisfied with
the possibilities of the debentures, they should
note that the latter have not the security usually
associated with the term. Also that, whereas
the ‘ A” series may be invested only in approved
trustee stocks, the directors are allowed practi-
cally unlimited scope with the “B’s”
The Bulletin later discovered that this
co. was affiliated with about 15 others,
mostly interlocking through sharehold-
ings or directorates. Because of the un-
usual method of finance, the paucity of
information available as to the figures
of the Investment Exec. Trust and the
interlocking, nature of related companies,
The Bulletin declined to accept the
Southern British Co.’s advertising or to
publish offers of shares and/or deben-
ture issues made by any member of the
group.
Last week the Stevens Government
took action at the request of the M.L.
Government. It rushed through legisla-
tion appointing Justice Halse Rogers a
Royal Commission to investigate the acti-
vities of a. group of 17 investment cos.
operating in N. S. Wales. The members
of the group most familiar to the N.S.W.
public are the Southern British National
Trust and V. B. Mclnnes and Co. (Aust.)„
Ltd. In Maoriland the best-known is
Investment Exec. Trust of N.Z. An in-
vestigation is also being carried out in
Auckland under a special Act.
An interim report issued by a former
M. commission of inquiry refers to
heavy dealings in the shares of British
National Investment Trust by J. W. S.
McArthur and C. G. Alcorn. It de-
clares that about 240,000 2s. shares in
this co. were transferred to the British
National Trust at a price “over £1 each.”
More than £lOOO stamp duty was paid.
The Investment Executive Trust of
N. in April, 1934, had a paid share
capital of £29,970. J. W. S. McArthur is
managing director; in evidence before
the Sydney commission he stated that
the public had subscribed a little over
£400,000 in debentures. He had taken
about four-fifths of the ordinary shares
for cash which he had received from the
co. for “compiling records.” Nearly all
the shares in the Maoriland co. had been
transferred to the Sydney concern, South-
ern British National Trust, now practi-
cally owner of the M.L. co., which held
investments in 200 concerns in different
parts of the world.
Questioned by the Judge, McArthur
said that over the last three years his
holdings had increased from £24,000 to
£90,000 by “profitable deals in com-
panies—these companies.” At the for-
mation of the Southern British National
Trust about £95,000 of ss. shares was
subscribed. They were paid for by the
exchange of debentures in the British
National Trust, a co. registered in Can-
berra about the same time.
McArthur added that £200,000 had
been raised from the public by “the Can-
berra company.” The “Telegraph” build-
ing stood in the books at £450,000. This
building, incidentally, was given a special
opening about two months ago.
C. G. Alcorn, managing director of
Investment Securities Associations, Ltd.,
said he did not know whether there were
any other directors. There had been no
“Why, you”
“ ’Sense me, mister, c’d y’ tell me the way to the G.P.O.?”
board meetings ; “you don’t have board
meetings of private companies.”
Evidence was taken on Thursday and
Friday; the inquiry was then adjourned
to August 20.
Control of Bond Cos.
These days, when investments generally
are returning very little, and short-term
fixed-deposit rates are the lowest on
record, the go-getter with a glamorous
prospectus and an endless repertoire of
sales-talk finds easy marks amongst
those with so little capital that ordinary
investment returns mean near-starvation.
The person who can least afford to
lose is most often the mug. On the other
hand, some very high dignitaries have
fallen for go-getters’ schemes in late
years.
There are bond cos. which have
every appearance of being honestly run
in a genuine endeavor to prove a new
industry—mostly a primary industry of
some kind. The British Government, for
instance, has been encouraging Empire
experiments in tung-nut culture, and
there are tung-nut cos. which seem to
be going about their job in a level-headed
way. Such propositions admittedly are
highly speculative, but so long as the
public is not overcharged for land and
services, and no extravagant promises
are made, there is little objection to their
schemes, except that shares are at all
times preferable to bonds.
Many forestry cos., too, are doing
their planting and maintenance in a satis-
factory manner. But nearly every one
of them could have done the job at much
less cost to the bondholder. Charges
for planted acres have been far too
high. And many people have bought
bonds on the strength of doubtful, one-
sided sales-arguments. Very few pros-
pectuses have put
their proposition
fully and fairly.
“Bond s,” which
are investment con-
tracts covered by no
specific legislation
such as covers shares
and share - issues,
have been found an
easy way for a Smart
salesman with a few hundred pounds of
capital to set himself up in a more or less
permanent job on a fat salary.
The few hundred pounds may be
enough to register a company, issue a
prospectus and acquire options over land.
There is little or no personal responsi-
bility on the promoter ; the company of
straw protects him and provides his
salary. If the scheme goes well there
is probably more than salary ; rarely is
the co. prohibited from paying dividends
to shareholders even though bondholders
get nothing.
The danger in such propositions is that
they are promoted by salesmen. Their
prospectuses are salesmen’s prospectuses.
The financial side is usually dealt with
in a slipshod way, and the position
is rarely put before the public on expert
authority.
It is up to Governments to introduce
legislation covering bond-issues. Exces-
sive profits on land and service charges
should be curbed, a limit should be im-
posed on selling exes., deposits should be
demanded by the Government the same
as with insurance cos., and certain definite
information should be made compulsory
in the prospectus.
Operations of these concerns could be
put on a sounder basis without making
capital-raising a close preserve of mem-
bers of Stock Exchanges. Such control
is far from desirable. Tight legislation
on the foregoing lines, particularly pro-
visions restricting selling exes., say, to
10 p.c., would put most go-getting con-
cerns off the road.
The outlook for German support at
the wool sales is a little brighter. Repre-
sentatives of the British Board of Trade
have been negotiating for settlement of
Germany’s overseas commercial debts and
relaxation of exchange restrictions. An
agreement has been signed to operate
from August 20. Germany is running
out of raw materials, and there is a possi-
bility of trade reopening with France in
wooltops. Brisbane sales, the first of the
new season, are also scheduled for
August 20. Offerings before Christmas
are expected to total something less than
1,600,000 bales.
* * * *
The overseas wool cheque for the year'
to June 30 totalled £57,000,000, and
brought £21,000,000 more into the
growers’ pockets than in 1932-33. Chief
customers were the U.K., Japan, Ger-
many, Belgium, France and Italy—in
that order. The favorable trade balance
for the year was £48,000,000 (Aust.),
and the commodity balance £38,800,000,
an improvement of over £12,000,000.
Wheat exports were valued at less than
half those of the preceding year.

The United States grain crop looks
like being the lowest since 1894, and
about half the yield of 1932. Including
a large carryover from 1933, the present
crop is reckoned enough to supply nor-
mal domestic needs and carry 130,d00,000
bushels into next season.
Australian gold production continqes
to mount in every State except the
Speck, where the yellow metal is mainly
a by-product of at present unprofitable
base ores. Westralia produces over
three-fourths of the Commonwealth out-
put, while, owing to the development of
the Mt. Coolon, Mt. Morgan and Golden
Plateau mines, Queensland has rapidly
outstripped Vic. for second place. Here
are production figures for the first half
of the past three years:
1932. 1933. 1934.

Gold remained around £6 18s. per fine
ounce in London last week. The popu-
larity of mining-scrip gambles has re-
ceived a check, and shares in established
shows have weakened. But concerns that
“have the goods,” and are producing
them, are reaping the benefit of present
favorable gold prices.

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Innisfail”: Receipt from the Sugar
Pioducers of a reprint of newspaper
articles shows how the foreign-immi-
grant question has reoriented itself in
North in 15 years. At the
end of the war, no association would
have dared to approve of Italian
settlement—popular opinion then was
that the authorities were opening the way
brigandage and other Mediterranean
villainies, and there were those who
seemed to imagine that a few years would
see the use of the stiletto taught in
schools and bombs sold over bar coun-
ters. The pamphlet now issued says that
absorption of the Italian into Australian
stock will become complete within three
generations, at most, and that he is
mostly a decent citizen and a hard
worker. It adds that there is no danger
of his creating an alien State or even of
tiansplanting Italian ideals and culture
Australian soil—he absorbs into
the Australian mass too rapidly for that.

X.T. : Brisbane Show has been put-
ting up records both in attendances and
entries. It can teach the two big southern
shows a bit in organisation. Its cattle-
men in particular have developed the edu-
cational side of the exhibition, and, while
the entries in some sections do not com-
pare with those of Sydney, the facilities
for lectures and for the driving home of
the practical lessons of the judging cer-
tainly do. Brisbane has the only show-
ground which can boast decent clubhouse
accommodation for its stock exhibitors.
On the Sydney ground a couple of small
boxes are the only places to which ex-
hibitors can retreat for discussion except
on full-dress occasions, but Affleck House
at Bowen Park provides a meeting-place
which every showground in Australia
might duplicate.

Humo : Though I know nothing of
abos., my associations with Kanakas lead
me to disagree with “Sailor” (B. 27/6/’34)
when he remarks that “understanding
and kindness will make of them willing
friends.” I, like “Sailor,” have worked
large labor lines for many years. I still
work a line of over a hundred “boys.” My
experience has been that no Kanaka
understands kindness; for immediately
any consideration is shown to him (such
as an extra stick of tobacco or a day off)
he will invariably come along and ask
for more. A “boy” will always let you
down, and the more imperative his co-
operation the harder you fall. The only
way either to work or to deal with
Kanakas is to say what you mean, mean
what you say, never give them praise,
punish severely when punishment is
necessary, and at all times treat them as
Kanakas.

Horn Island”: Apropos this opium
smuggling, I was once starting down the
O.T. line in Cape York when a person
who was mostly rags and whiskers came
off a lugger and asked me if I would take
a bag of brown sugar to a friend
several hundred miles south. He said
that he had promised to land it at Nor-
manton, but had decided not to make the
voyage and didn’t want to disappoint his
pal. I refused his proffered freight
money, hitched the nuisance on to a
pack-saddle and a few days out suddenly
remembered it when 1 was looking for
a pillow. After a night or two I de-
tected a strange odor which certainly was
not brown sugar. A royal commission
held at midnight revealed five sardine-tins
m the centre of the bag. lam not one
to interfere with other people’s vices, but
it anybody sees a crocodile in a certain
Cape York river who looks as if he has
just swallowed a rainbow I hope he
won’t blame me for corrupting the poor
saurian. And if there are any gardeners
around the Gulf who suffered a famine
of delights in 1911, they may have the
consolation of knowing that I got some
free sugar that year.
* * * *
“Murlonga”: Home Sec. Hanlon,
after a recent northern tour, has been
telling how his department takes care of
the abos. and how well they thrive under
his administration. I question whether
he saw any abos. other than those in
mission stations and on settlements • and
[hose abos., largely neither white nor
black, have departed from the ways of
their fathers. Take the pure blacks in
one small district, healthy for man and
beast—Georgina River, from Urandangie
to Camooweal. During eight years,
1913-21, I knew, or knew of, 300
to 500 pure abos. in the district,
but I never heard of the birth of
one aboriginal baby. There were odd
half-caste and other strains. They were
outnumbered ten to one by the deaths
of older people. At the end of T 7 there
was a camp of old blacks on Walgra
numbering 15 to 20. Though they were
treated well by the station and given
every consideration, four years later but
three of them remained.

“Fossicker”: “Jerry’s” par. (B. 1/8/’34)
about the farmer who innocently deco-
rated a kangaroo with an old waistcoat
in which his absent wife’s savings were
hidden reminds me of a yarn told by
old Harry Elling, a veteran of Cape York
(N.Q.). He used to keep his gold in a
bag made from the tanned skin of a
small green tree-snake. One day he left
the bag with lOoz. of gold in his tent
while he went to see if the billy was boil-
“It's yours for fifty quid. Take it or
leave it."
“I th-th-think I’ll I-leave it now.”
ing. He returned to find the bag missing,
while out from the tent glided a large
carpet snake with a telltale bulge in its
middle. The snake escaped, and to this
day no carpet snake is safe once old
Harry has sighted it.

“Vanrook”: The record put up by Mrs.
Talbot vSanderson, who lives in Mel-
bourne, will take some beating in modern
times. Starting out a few months ago
from one of her husband’s stations in the
Gulf Country, she rode to Brisbane in
fast stages of from 40 to 50 miles per
day, with breaks for mustering and in-
specting the family properties. Mrs.
Sanderson did the job in a light poley
saddle mostly on 15-hand hacks with a
bit of spirit in them. The trip is not
nearly finished. She will continue to Mel-
bourne, with one stop on- the way.
**-'*.'*
“Sailor”: Where those New Guinea
navigators picked up their crews (B.
20/6/’34 and B. 1/7/’34) I don’t know.
Perhaps they had as much idea of a com-
pass and chart as their allegedly bad
helmsmen. I’ve worked many degrees of
long, and lat. in New Guinea, Papua,
North Australia, East Indies and
Solomon Islands, in both sail and steam,
and I can say that any beach Kanaka or
Binghi after a good gaze at the figuring
of a compass card and a squint at the star
over the fore truck can keep a course
that would make a gyro wheel-repeater
look like a greenhorn. The average salt-
water Kanaka is as good a seaman as the
average Scandinavian, and that’s saying
a lot. But if the “brassbound” captains
of the launches and cutters will put bush-
men on the wheel they deserve what is
sure to come.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
Mooing of cattle, the whirr of machinery,
the voice of the ring announcer, and a sad
voice which hoarsely cries “ ’Ot pies and sos-
sidge rolls, ’am sandwidges and sof’ drinks”
all mingle with the sound of hundreds of
voices. The Show is here.
The district exhibits were a triumph of
arrangement. The one-farm exhibits had
each its little family group, proudly pointing
to this or that. L. D. Christensen, of Crow’s
Nest, again took the first prize, but the points
between the four exhibitors were not so many.
Theima Beck, aged 15, a capable, self-com-
posed little thing, was her father’s right hand
° n exhibit from Stanwell (C.Q.). She is
the eldest of three sisters, all of whom do their
fair share of the work of the farm. Mrs.
Beck must be a good teacher for these young
J anc h judging by her jams
and jellies and other exhibits.
More women entered for the ring events
this year than ever before. This, no doubt
was due to the fact that there are two riding
clubs m existence and another just being formed
in Brisbane. Beryl Collins, of Nindooimbah
E 1v Ver f l r of f her lovely horses > and
Miss D. Gray, of Grafton, N.S.W., was in for
everything in which a woman may compete, as
were May Wood, of Warra, Miss Kemp, of
Carr.p Hill, and Mrs. G. Wrigley. Mrs. Jim
Scrymgeour did not ride, but a small daughter
did Doris Heindorff and Mrs. Stan Schooley
she was Hazel Willcocks—made several
appearances, and Mrs. Schooley’s two small
daughters, very businesslike in their riding togs,
were in for the junior events.
Ten small girls were included in what used
l ca^ the Farm Boys’ Carqp, but which
will have to change its name if it is to con-
tinue on co-educational lines. These lassies
came from various spots in Queensland, and
were as keen as thp boys on seeing everything,
and learning all about what they see.
Mrs. Ralph, in georgette draperies of a deli-
cate beige shade, with a bouquet in tonings of
pale pink and yellow, was the official hostess
at the Anzac Ball, and led the debs, along to
make their curtsies. Brig.-General Ralph and
Colonel F. Lorenzo —she was in black velvet —
gave a gay touch of color to the show in their
scarlet mess jackets. Trains were much worn,
Mrs. J. Lipscombe, of Julia Creek, trailing
black skirts after her, as did Mrs. Eric Molle,
who was Rose Jardine, and is as lovely as any
of her celebrated ancestresses. Mrs. Barry
Watts in maize, with a long train, looked like a
Viking’s daughter. One tiny girl, in a bouffant
irock of pale pink organdie, wore a coronet
of live pansies and a shoulder knot of the
same flower as her only ornaments. R. D.
Huish, who is president of the R.5.5.1.L.A.,
brought his wife, who wore mignonette-green;
and R. C. Lloyd, secretary of the same body,
proudly escorted his better-half, who looked
charming in rose color.
Much more formal was the United Service
Ball. There was a thrill for the debs. —a
surplus of men, and most of them in uni-
form ! Lady Isaacs, in gold brocade, was with
the vice-regal party, and her bouquet was
daffodils and pansies. The one passed to Miss
Amy Smith was composed of red roses, and
someone must have whispered that the rose is
her favorite, for the posy presented to her
at the Anzac Ball was of the same lovely
color.
The debs, were charming and graceful.
Elizabeth Edwards gave a touch of color to
her snowy flounces by adding a shoulder spray
of forget-me-nots and a pink rose. Mrs.
J. J. Buchanan, that grand old lady, came
along to watch with pride her granddaughter
socially launched, and Mr. and Mrs. E. E.
Edwards also were there. Mrs. J. L. Wool-
cock had two debs, with her, her own daughter
Joananne and the late Justice’s granddaughter
Peggy Dinham-Peren.
There were 72 hostesses at the Matrons’ Ball
—a cheerful party. The old South Brisbane
Technical College Hall provided the setting.
Once all the best dances were held there, and, if
it is not too cold, the river by moonlight gives
a most romantic touch. Mrs. Hannibal King
presented the 11 debutantes. As the Gover-
nor had a date with the Jewish Council of
Women, and had to attend its ball first, an
exception was made for once, and the young
things were allowed to dance before being
presented.
The South Brisbane Hall also saw the Girl
Guides’ Ball. There were two debs., Kathleen
Jackson and Dorothy Yuille, and the Macart-
ney lady did the presentation honors. His Ex.
went along, and Lady Isaacs also was.present.
The vice-regal parties have been large numeri-
cally, with. Capt. Honnor looking after his
Ex., and Lieut. Findlay minding Lady Isaacs’s
coat. Then Amy Smith and cousin Peter
Wilson usually are there, too, and Mr. Fielden,
the private sec.
When the Lord and Lady Mayoress enter-
tained Lady Isaacs at afternoon-tea in the City
Hall the deputy Premier, Mr. P. Pease, lent
his moral support, and Dulcie Sampson said it
with music at the piano.
Mrs. Silas Harding, who is down for the
Show —than Silas there is no better judge of a
thoroughbred in Queensland —was tea’d by Mrs.
R. A. Wearne. Same afternoon Mrs. C. L. Mc-
Fadden, of Nambour, whose husband is presi-
dent of the Country Press Association, also
rattled the teacups, most of her guests hailing
from country centres.
Pamela Persse, of Tabragalba, who has
entered some of her horses in the Show, gave
a huge party for about 70 guests before the
Girl Guides’ Ball. There were ever so many
parties that night, Mr. and Mrs. E. J. Watt,
of Sydney, and Carlie Yaldwyn, of Too-
woomba, also entertaining. J. P. Love had
Doris Drake, of Los Angeles, and Doreen
Hooper—she was on the committee of the ball
—at his table.
Alice Thomson, who has Mrs. Maisie
Tanner, of Sydney, staying with her, gave her
cocktail party at the family home at New
Farm, and Mrs. J. Mowbray Thomson helped
to look after daughter’s guests.
Peggy Arnott, of Sydney, is staying with
Peggy Menzies. Before coming up to Brisbane
the Sydney Peggy had been staying with the
Leslie Hills, outside Moree. Nancy and Betty
Allard, of Burwood, also are up for the Show,
and the Bells, of Coochin Coochin, are here
in force, the three girls, Una, Dolly and Aileen,
Mr. and Mrs. E. T. Bell, Mr. and Mrs. Bert
Bell and Mr. and Mrs. Victor Bell all having
gathered together.
Mr. and Mrs. W. Kent, of Jondaryan, with
debutante daughter Marjorie, and Mrs. Duncan
Nelson, of Toowoomba, with debutante
daughter Mary, are among the week’s hosts and
hostesses.
Spring and winter modes mingled at the
official opening of the Show. Lady Isaacs
added an ermine cape to her black gown,
and Miss Amy Smith wore a tailored suit of
red Angora cloth and a hat to match. Miss
Pat Honnor wore black-and-white checks.
Most of those who were at the official Show
luncheon went on to the races. Mrs. J. L.
Woolcock not only had her own daughter
and her late husband’s granddaughter with her,
but four other debutantes nestled under her
wing. The Bill Kents, of Jondaryan, Leslie
Kent and his wife, the R. M. Bells, of Eskdale,
the Bells, of Coochin, Mrs. William Collins,
daughter Beryl, Pamela Persse, the Lloyds,
of Harrow, and Lola Rouse, of Toowoomba,
Mrs. Darvall, of Boonah, and her two hand-
some daughters, Andy Tyson and his wife and
daughter, the Harveys, from Pittsworth, and
the Malcolm McDougalls, from Dalveen, were
among the hundreds on the lawn. Parliament
was well represented, for Jimmy Stopford,
Randolph Bedford, A. W. Fadden and R. M.
Bell were all taking a day’s holiday. Big Bill
McCormack, retired from the political arena
and now living quietly in Sydney, also is up
and backing winners.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The huge mauve, pink and blue parch-
ment lanterns and the trees of flowering
peach, David Jones’s setting for their
spring fashion show, made fairy-like the
Uni. Medical Society’s Ball. Taffeta has
caught the fancy of youth. Girls, dozens
of them, in coats and capes, long and
short, severely tailored, puffed as to
sleeve or stiff with frills, rustled out of
motor-cars and tramcars. Lace was the
favorite in the official group. Mrs. C. B.
Blackburn (president of the ball com-
mittee) wore hers in black, Mrs. E. W.
Fairfax chose the blue of an Australian
sapphire, and Dr. Edgar Stephen’s wife
stuck to beige. Ellis Dettman wore crepes
in her favorite Nile green. Silver threads
gleamed in Cecily Nixon’s white crepes
(she was the only deb.). Mrs. C. G.
Berge’s black taffetas had a ruffled train.
Margery Shine was on the gold standard
from shoulder strap to tip of train. Jes-
sica Malone bound her head with a plait
of her own fair hair, and was rhythmic
in white satins. Patsy Dangar also chose
white satins, pleated from knees to toes.
Diana Davidson’s crepes were green, and
Felicia Garvan’s velvets blue.
Boy Scouts say their Campfire Ball
was the biggest event of the season.
Scoutmasters came to it in uniform, but,
as a concession to their best girls, wore
evening shoes. Illness kept the patron.
Miss Charles Fairfax, away, but she sent
a party, including Mollie Mack, in leaf-
green velvets, to represent her. Nora
Mack wore rose-petal-pink crepes. Cap-
tain and Mrs. W. de Merrall, Denmark’s
Consular Hosts, Mrs. E. T. Pilcher, the
friendly Kelso Kings, she in trained
velvets, and Mrs. R. C. Hagon were
others who warmed their fingers at the
campfires on their tables. The First Port
Jackson troop of Sea Scouts kept things
going. They wore sou’-westers, and when
they weren’t dancing hornpipes they sat
round the big campfire in the middle of
the room and sang chanties with such
heartiness that everyone soon joined in.
It was a great night, as the president of
the Scout Club, N. J. Bowden, Chief
Commissioner Col. J. Maughan and the
Commissioner for Sea Scouts, P. Ship-
way, all agreed.
The storm that had gathered since
lunch-time on Friday broke, just when
the Acting Governor’s wife was opening
the Y.W.C.A. Festival of Spring. But
none heeded the roar of thunder, the
crash of hailstones or the glowering sky.
The beauty of flowering peach-trees,
masses of daffodils, mignonette, lavender,
sweet-peas and violets and the chirping
of canaries filled the eye and ear with
pleasure. The girls were pictures in
their old-world dresses of flowered
cretonne and silk. The stalls did a roar-
ing trade, and it’s on the cards that the
£4OO needed to gain the association’s ob-
jective of £3OOO will be forthcoming.
Newcastle has had a ferry disaster,
and Sydney is full of sympathy. At
10.45 on Thursday night, the Bluebell
left Newcastle for Stockton (a distance
about as far as from High-street to
Neutral Bay), most of its passengers men
and women returning home after the
theatre and from the community singing
that had been heard in Sydney on a
broadcast, when the Warraneen and she
collided, and the Bluebell sank. The
death toll was three, Mrs. Annie Kerr
and Mrs. Isabella Frew, whose bodies
have been recovered, and Mrs. Gladys
May Bignall, who is still missing. What
it might have been but for the heroism
of members of the Warraneen crew, who
without hesitation dived into the, harbor
and held up women and children till the
boats came to the rescue, it is hard to
say.
. Knight Thomas Bavin didn’t open the
International Poster Exhibition at David
Jones’s. A court case detained him, so
American Consul Caldwell bravely
stepped to the front of the platform.
Nearly every Consul came —the Mar-
chesa Ferrante with her Marchese ; the
fair and tall Lola de Dardel with her
Swedish Consul father ; the Danish Host
couple, and the representatives of France,
Mexico, China, Greece and Austria.
Mrs. Norman McLeod was with her
Latvian Consul husband. The William
Moores were glimpsed. Artists Alfred
Coffey and Mary Edwards looked at the
work with critical eyes ; so did Howard
Hinton. Sydney Ure Smith was one of
those called upon to speak. Julian Ash-
ton kept his thoughts to himself. And
later the C. L. Jones couple dispensed tea
and cheery words to all.
Germany’s Oberammergau poster with
its slim, gleaming cross suspended be-
tween two hills and high above the low-
lying hamlet attracted everyone, even
those who didn’t know it had won the
Paris prize. England’s zoo posters got a
laugh, especially the one in which
humans are caged, and the animals are
walking about reading the notices, and
looking with obvious clelight on Church
and Law dignitaries having the time of
their lives on the swings and in the pools.
One of Thomas Cook’s, a black untying
the cords binding a white man to a tree
and saying, “Why didn’t you say you
were from Cook’s? I’m their local
agent!” was another that drew a gurgle
of laughter from all. Italy’s ribbon of
railroad, with its silver spots marking such
places as Florence, Naples and Rome, and
a sketch of a hand lifting a layer of
Pompeii were two that showed imagina-
tion. Czecho-Slovakia’s “Shakspeare” and
Sestra Angelicka posters are products of
a more modernistic school than Sydney is
used to. An Australian artist known as well
abroad as he is here told this Letter that
Australia’s “Sunshine and Romance,”
“Blue Mountains” and “Kangaroos”
were equal to the best shown. But a
wild-eyed, longish-haired youth standing
entranced before a panel of four small
Japanese pictures depicting the seasons
waved his hand and almost shouted that
all the others were crude, only fit for
savages with their vivid colorings, and
asserted, “When you leave you will only
remember these with their suggestion of
space and soft clouds, and that little
summer tree!”
A. R. J. Watt, K.C., will open a special
exhibition of water-color drawings, pen
drawings and etchings by Norman
Lindsay at The Bulletin’s Macleod
Gallery to-morrow at 3 p.m.
Something extra-special in the way of
fun and frolic is promised at the Kinder-
garten Union’s All-night Vagabond
Cabaret to be held on October 3. Justin
Harve’s Bohemians will provide the
music. Mrs. J. C. Windeyer is the presi-
dent ; Mrs. J. McGeorge, Mrs. E. Bel-
lingham Roberts and Miss Eve Alwyn
are the secretaries; the treasury is
being looked after by W. G. Layton and
Lionel Dare. The Pompadour ballroom
will house the revels between 10 p.m. and
4 a.m. There’ll be a real supper some-
where about midnight. From then on-
wards till going-home time, you will be
able to help yourselves to saveloys or
sausage rolls, as the fit takes you.
Here is Mary Wells, who has good
looks, a friendly manner and a flair for
dressing, three in-
gredients which
make lor popu-
larity. She is the
elder daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Vin-
cent H. Wells, who
have recently come
down to Sydney
lrom Broken Hill,
where he was
Stipendiary Magis-
trate for about 18
months.
The love the
German people
had for Hinden-
burg was shown by
the numbers in
which they came to
the Assembly Hall
for the memorial
service • shown,
too by’ the flowers
with which the
altar was decked
stocks, sweet-peas,
lily-of - the - valley!
Flax leaves some
of them lacquered
mauve, kept com-
pany with arum
lilies. Dominating
everything was the
photograph from
which the dead
field-marshal look-
ed down on the
Rev. G. Lahusen,
pastor of the Lutheran Church, and on
the congregation. This was wreathed in
black-lacquered laurel leaves and red and
white flowers; it was flanked with
the swastika and the black-white-and-
red flags of Germany. Many of the
Consuls sported their medals ; our own
navy and army representatives wore uni-
form. Commander Moore represented
the Governor-General, and General
Anderson Acting-Governor Street. Syd-
ney’s Lord Mayor and General
Rosenthal were others who stood
upon the entry of the German Consul-
General, Dr. Rudolf Asmis, while
Brahms’s “German Requiem,” played by
Vern Barnett, stole with solemn grandeur
through the building. Then “Grosser
Gott, wir loben dich” (“Great God, We
Praise Thee”) rang out. Impressive was
the traditional “Ich hatt’ einen Kamara-
den,” sung by the German men's choir
(one member proudly wearing his iron
cross). Leonore Gotsch in Schubert’s
“Du bist die Ruh”and Phyllis McDonald’s
violin in Bach’s Aria in G Minor carried
messages of peace and love.
After the service and while still the
majesty of Beethoven’s “Funeral March”
echoed through the building, Dr. and Mrs.
Asmis stood at the door and acknow-
ledged the congregation’s sympathy, and
inside very young frauleins and kindly-
looking fraus gathered up lovingly a few
violets or lily-of-the-valley to take away
and cherish in memory of the “Father of
the Fatherland.”
Sydney was busy honoring that great
Australian Lawrence Hargrave last week.
On the 50th anniversary of his reading
his first paper on flying to the Royal
Society, ’planes swooped and circled
around the site of his old home. In the
evening admirers of all ages and all sizes
found their way to the Uni. Here Dr.
Mary Booth, T. C. Roughley and Pro-
fessor O. U. Vonwiller held the ears of
all with stories of the pioneer’s efforts,
while eyes were enthralled with exhibits
of the devices which have been the foun-
dation of the art of flying. It is worth
remembering that the first aeroplane ever
to fly publicly, that of Santos-Dumont in
France, was based in design on Har-
grave’s box kites, which possessed greater
stability, more lift and less drag than any
apparatus previously discovered.
Hargrave died in 1915, just six weeks
after his only son Geoffrey (who was on
the way to become as brilliant an en-
gineer as his father) was killed on Galli-
poli. So he saw his dream of flying come
true, and also probably something of
what a man of his vision must have
feared—how destructive a weapon flying
would be in the hands of the war-lords.
His eldest daughter, an artist, was hon.
sec. to the A.T.N.A. in its beginnings.
She married a naval architect, and now
lives in London. One of her two daugh-
ters is a medical woman. Her sister is
Mrs. Blackman, whose husband after the
war occupied an official post at Geneva,
where she got a reputation as a charming
hostess. A third sister trained at the
P.A.H., and married a doctor in South
Africa.
The alterations being carried out at
the Town Hall, necessitating the using
of the Druitt-street entrance, added to
the excitement of Austral’s first concert.
For sixpence you had your choice of an
orange or mauve programme in a crinkly
paper cover through which you glimpsed
a very windswept Austral as Brunnhilde.
In her frock of ivory moire velvet with
its sweeping train and cleverly-arranged
fulness, the songstress looked like a
piece of statuary. A diamond bracelet
and a single stone gleaming at the neck
of her throat-high corsage were her only
ornaments for the first group of songs.
After that she wore Gladys Moncrieff’s
gift—a spray of slipper orchids and lily-
of-the-valley. Floral offerings there were
in abundance, among them a laurel
wreath brightened with red camellias
and a replica in red camellias of Brunn-
hilde’s spear.
Sydney’s Mayoral Lud and his lady
were early arrivals. She, like everyone else,
stuck to her coat (summer ermine) the
whole evening. Glimpsed in passing were
the Kelso King lady’s mulberry laces
and Eva Wunderlich’s floral brocade
coat, with its pink ostrich-feather collar.
Nellie Veitch’s lily-of-the-valley green
chiffons were warm under a mink coat.
Beatrice Tange paid a round of calls
during the interval. Joan Mackaness
dangled long earrings above floral chif-
fons. Mrs. T. S. Gordon was wrapped
in black lace. Austral’s old friend Mrs.
Arthur Scrivener was a front-seater. The
Marr Thompsons, Beaupre Bassett and
her mother, the H. Amadios, Gordon
Lavers and John Dudley were others
who waxed enthusiastic over every item
on the programme.
Gladys Moncrieff slipped into the Arts
Club’s party to listen to Jack Freeman,
the Australian youngster who is giving
every promise of making a name foi
himself as a pianist. Mrs. Florence
Taylor, who wore a wide-brimmed velvet
hat, introduced Jack, who, without any
fuss, sat down and played Chopin and.
later, without any apparent nervousness,
announced that he would play some ot
his own compositions.

Chatter
There was quite a doggy atmosphere
about the Dogs’ Ball at Bibron’s. Queer
little double-join ted toy poodles, each
with a number tied upon his collar,, were
sold at Is. each, the holder of the lucky-
number dog taking home a very small
and fluffy pom. who spent the evening
asleep or cuddled up on the shoulder of
one of his admirers. Mrs. Barry Thom-
son wore hyacinth-blue lace, silver leaves
in her hair and a chromium-and-ivory
dog bracelet, a present from the Wallace
Mitchell children, to mark the occasion.
Mrs. Mitchell’s blue dress had fluffy
feathers outlining the back of the cor-
sage. Mrs. H. Davis was in blackberry
with gold “shoulder-blades,” and Mrs.
P. H. Lock wore black satin. Mrs. Rus-
sell Keon-Cohen, in black lace and a
brocade coat, presided at the treasury,
just inside the door. Mrs. Ernest Rolls
uncorked bottles in sparkling black
sequins, and. Louise Lovely risked the
perfection of her white gown by crack-
ing eggs for her tall silver cocktail
shaker.
Mrs. Sandford, who donated the pom.
pup, wore green with gold hangings.
Others who moved among the date-palms
were Mrs. R. G. Stillwell, in black lace ;
Linda Smith, in long-sleeved black
velvet; Joyce Walker, whose shoulders
glittered with gold sequins; Norma
Lloyd, in black chiffon, and Betty Man-
son, who contrasted her blue dress with
scarlet shoes, shoulder spray and diadem.
Beth Duckett was in white, and Violet
Eastwood’s off-white gown spread itself
to black daisies round the neck. Betty
Giles varied her cherry-colored turnout
with a black cape and gold speckles on
her frock.
The Dogs’ Home had its 21st birth-
day this year. Its objects are to teach
the public kindness to animals, to give
temporary kennel shelter and a bone a
day to lean wanderers, to rescue strays,
to find good homes for suitable dogs and
to execute a painless death when neces-
sary. It provides accommodation for
dog and cat boarders, and hospital ser-
vices are given to the dogs and cats of
genuinely poor owners, for the home
does not poach upon the territory of
practising vets. An average of 8000 dogs
passes through the home annually, occa-
sionally as many as 200 tail-waggers
being there at the same time.
Science students up at The Shop spent
an afternoon and evening explaining
apparatus to crowds who visited the dis-
play. In the physiology room “Eric”
was in good form. He’s a figure with
removable inner workings, and on occa-
sions interrupts the demonstrator with
terse and critical comments. The origin
of “Eric’s” voice is a secret; if med. stu-
dents are asked where it comes from
they just say “Ah! ” and look mysterious.
The uninitiated were dazed over the
workings of the inner ear, for nobody
liked to appear so ignorant as to inquire
which way up the model worked—for
the ear that we are familiar with was left
in a drawer and not clapped on until the
budding sawbones had finished his dis-
course. Those interested in staying
power could have their lung capacity
measured on a gadget. If the reading
was disappointingly low the sweet young
thing in charge would say “You couldn’t
have taken a very big breath.” In the
bio-chem. lab. students explained the
mysteries of butter-fats in an atmosphere
of weird smells and strange bottles. In
the engineers’ domain lived a cathode
ray, a sinister green thing which made
faces at you ; it’s very sensitive. Within
a dark, isolated workroom, with a “Don’t
touch the tap” danger warning outside,
was a crackling, spitting purple current
—made-to-order lightning. A peep down
the lens of the pyrometer and you read
through color the temperature of a fur-
nace. Adventurous spirits measured their
powers of resistance through grasping
handles which felt more and more un-
pleasant as milliamps. scampered along
a dial. A visit to an unostentatious tin-
shed revealed the secrets of good road-
building and a diamond drill, the jewels
of which are more interesting to feel
than to look at.
Mrs. D. Binks chose Killara Bridge
Club, South Yarra, for her afternoon
party. Iceland poppies of gold melting
into pink decorated the attractive card-
rooms and the lounge where the players
drifted for a tea diversion. The hostess’s
tailored suit went gay about the shoul-
ders with a vivid spray of berries, and
her hat was a trim Breton sailor. Mrs.
Ewan Downie’s halo hat and fog-grey
roat were distinctive. A beige coat and
hat were matched by Mrs. Bertram
Lazarus. Mrs. M. M. Phillips, Mrs.
Stogdale, Mrs. Lester, Mrs. G. Scott, in
magpie black-and-white, and Mrs.
George Goodes were a few of the others.
Mme. Marcel Crivelli gave an engage-
ment celebration tea as an opportunity
for felicitations to be offered to her
future daughter, Gwenda Boyd. Miss
Boyd and Roger Crivelli have recently
announced their engagement. Madame
presided at her blossom-sprayed tea-
table in nut-brown silk boucle, a lace
motif making a variation upon the cor-
sage. The guest of honor, who chose a
black berette and black coat lavishly
trimmed with fur, accepted a posy from
the hostess and several more from well-
wishers. Mrs. Reg Boyd was wrapped
in a coat of air-force blue. Mary Boyd,
in a navy suit, Mrs. John Gurner and
Brenda, Grizel Hamilton, Elspeth Elder
and Barbara Weigall were also of the
party.
Wearing a little swathed toque is Mrs.
Barry Thomson, president of the Dogs’
Home and Animal Hospital auxiliary,
which ran a cabaret ball last week. Mrs.
Thomson’s soft spot for animals does
not mean that she has no time for other
good works. She’s a supporter of the
Orthopaedic Hospital for Crippled Child-
ren at Frankston, and is on the com-
mittee of the Alfred Hospital and the
Blue Triangle. The William Foster Try
Society, which helps newsboys, has had
her aid for 20 years. Her husband,
Dr. Barry Thomson, is a Collins-street
medico. Only son Jack and his attrac-
tive American wife are on the stage in
the U.S.A. Portrait by Rembrandt.
In an atmosphere of daffodils, jon-
quils, japonica and peach-blossom the
Percy Dobsons mixed cocktails at
Bywong, Toorak. The hostess satisfied
her whim for floral adornment with a
lei of red, mauve and gold flowers round
her neck. Her sister, Hilary Symonds,
was smart in a utility combination of
navy-blue and white. G.H. was repre-
sented in the guest list by Colonel and
Mrs. Helme Pott and Aide Barbour. The
Marcus Wettenhalls, the Pat O’Hara
Woods, the Lindsay Mildreds, Nancy and
Jean Murdoch, Cedric Staughton and
Rupert Levi were a few of the others.
Barbola work and big-game fishing are
the favorite diversions of Mrs. Oswald Gib-
son. Mrs. Gibson’s unfortunate accident
has kept her a prisoner for many weeks,
but she has completed her dolls’ centen-
ary market from the level of her pillows.
It’s just as charming as the dolls’ house
which was such a success last year. No-
thing is forgotten. There are piles of
paper and string near the hand of each
doll stallholder. On the fish counters are
silver flounder, long slimy eels, pink lob-
sters ; at the oyster bar there are tall
stools and bottles of vinegar handy.
Crates of poultry, dressed birds, sheep’s
tongues, rabbits and sausages are there
to tempt the doll housewife and her
future little girl-owner. Of course, there
are sinks, chopping-blocks, cash-tills and
a lad in a coster cap ready to hand over
succulent vegetables (the mushrooms are
a dream). A flower stall includes mourn-
ing wreaths, their protectors bits of the
capsule coverings used for horse pills.
Dog-pill capsules are perfect for pickle
bottles. The market will raise money for
the Animal Welfare League.
In the room next the market is the
head of a splendid swordfish, stuffed
and made into a plaque and hung below
the framed certificate for catching him.
Mrs. Gibson attributes her success last
year in the Bay of Islands, M.L., to being
an excellent sailor, to good luck and
to her experience with a rod. The
swordy, who weighed 2421 b. and fought
for 55 minutes, chose the hook wielded
by the smallest and lightest person in all
the 20 launches out that day. He was
a tactless fish; the Governor-General
was after him, and the day before the
Duke of Northumberland had taken his
departure after a month’s fruitless wait-
ing for a bite.
Donations such as a bag of potatoes,
a case of oranges, a sheep or parcels
of foodstuffs, no matter how small, are
always welcome to St. Matthew’s Social
Service Guild, Prahran. Early in June
the Rev. and Mrs. P. W. Robinson em-
barked upon their campaign of providing
260 meals daily to undernourished chil-
dren from schools in Hawksburn, Wind-
sor and Prahran. The smallest youngsters
are under three, and walk over a mile for
their hot midday meal. Mr. Robinson
does what he calls the begging, and his
wife, with a bright smile, a gift for
organising and a band of helpers, runs
the kitchen ritual.
She arrives at- St. Matthew’s Hall at
9.15 every day. Presently appetising
odors arise from four gas stoves, where
a whole calf and part of a sheep are
being cooked —or, if it’s mutton day, three
sheep are required. After every meal a
sack of either cauliflowers or cabbages
has disappeared; also half a sack of pota-
toes, 40-501 b. of flour and 10 gallons of
milk. To-day 16 big plum puddings are
eaten with relish ; yesterday there was
bread-and-butter custard with apples crisp
and brown cooked on the top ; to-morrow
is roly-poly day. The youngsters look
forward to their second course so
anxiously that, although Mr. Robinson
marshals them in tens, says grace and
keeps order generally, there are always
excited yells for more pudding. These
children are all deserving cases chosen
by the teachers in their schools. They
are of all ages and creeds; need, not
creed, makes them eligible for assistance.
The members of the Marquartsteiner
troupe in “White Horse Inn” are never
happier than when romping with children.
After the Berry-street Foundling Home’s
annual meeting the committee members
meandered out on to the lawns to find
the seven husky dancers having a great
time with the babies. One little semi-
Maori lad didn’t reciprocate the compli-
ment, and shed woeful tears into the
tufted hat of his prancing human steed.
The other youngsters were all rosy smiles
in their best blue jumpers.
Pictured here by Broothorn is attrac-
tive Mrs. Sverre Kaaten, who is to be
found at present taking vigorous exer-
cise among the snow at Kosciusko.
Last week her Norwegian husband won
the combined championship ski event
and the jump, and his fair-haired sister
Dargie, who is in Australia on a
holiday, won the women’s open slalom.
This is the Norwegian girl’s first prize
for ski-ing, for although she has used
skis every winter since her childhood such
organised races are not known in her
part of Norway. Mrs. Kaaten is Aus-
tralian by birth; she and her husband
live in Sydney.
In his lecture on Siam at the Victoria
League, A. J. Phillips unfolded a picture
of Bangkok as the Venice of the East.
He spoke of the Siamese water gipsies,
who are born, live and die upon their
floating homes on the muddy river ; of the
hybrid population on shore ; of the King
of Siam’s palace, where electric-light and
-fan switches (there are fans, though pun-
kahs are more important) are placed
close to the floor—the reason being that
servants fall on their knees in the pre-
sence of royalty. During the afternoon
the senior vice-president; Mrs. Rupert
Greene, and the day’s hostesses, Mrs.
George Langridge, Robert Best’s lady,
Mrs. Chris Cowper, Mrs. Hudson East-
wood and Mrs. Fred Thiel, were busy in-
troducing a batch of new members.
Behind a thick green hedge in Domain-
road is an old cottage with Rathmines
painted above its verandah. Within is
Miss Lydia Allen, who celebrated her
100th birthday this week. Miss Allen
and the cottage, which is about the same
age and built of cedar and teak, came
out from England in 1853. Miss Allen’s
earliest recollections of Melbourne are
of the gold boom, when every adven-
turous man was packing his swag and
setting out to make a fortune. She
waved her handkerchief to the first
Cobb’s coach when it set out for the
diggings.
Hubert Gepp’s lady has no fear of
discomforts, for she has accompanied her
husband on a mining exploration trip to
The Granites. Miss L. Wilcox went, too,
and the men on business bent were H. C.
Chapman, owner of leases in The
Granites, Dr. Loftus Hills and M. L. C.
Stuckey. The party travelled per ’plane
through Broken Hill and Alice Springs.
There will be many attractions at
Moonee Valley racecourse on September
8, the date of the gymkhana in aid of
the Alfred Hospital and the Animal Wel-
fare League. Knight Robert Knox pre-
sided at the first meeting held to discuss
fixtures; at his right hand were his wife
and the Luxton lady, Mrs. J. G. Purves,
Mrs. Frank Andrew, Mrs. Lort Smith,
Miss Montgomery, Mrs. lan Macfarlan,
Mrs. Walsoe, Mrs. David Braham and
other ingredients of a responsive com-
mittee ; at his left were Colonel Burrell
and Wilfred Ryan. The horsy, doggy
and catty people were sifted to the most
suitable auxiliaries. There’s to be a long
string of equestrian events. Dog prizes
are not all destined for blue-blooded ani-
mals ; there will be comic events for the
most miserable-looking hound and for
the pup who looks most like his father,
and plain suburban cats, without even a
hint of Persian ancestry have a chance
of honor and glory. At the meeting
offers of prize money rolled in so rapidly
that the minute-recorder couldn’t keep
pace with the bids.
Mrs. E. C. Tronson, who on her visit
abroad was admitted to Dame Fashion’s
strongholds in London and Paris, de-
clares that we will be up to date for the
centenary. She stresses the importance
of the new sleeve length ; it should be
youthfully short and perhaps edged with
fur, or else three-quarter length, with
plenty of room to display your bracelets.
A very smart black suit has a drapery of
its figured blouse threaded under the
belt, a notion which obliterates the cut-
in-half appearance of our old friend the
three-piece. Mrs. Tronson commends
the little suit of soft wool jerselli, the
coat of which slopes over a flowered
blouse into a V at the back, an echo of
its frontal fastening. Tucks, frills and
kiltings have been pushed down to the
region of the hem. Evening dresses are
modest at the throat, not quite so low
at the back, and a bustle is as important
as a train. Broad taffeta bows are smart,
and for the sake of the new shallow-
crowned hats the long bob must be
pinned up of else shorn to a normal
length.

THE LITTLE SISTERS.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Nearly 2000 were present at the Toe
H Welcome Ball to his Ex. and Lady
Dugan at the Palladium, the first occa-
sion upon which a dance has been held
in the former skating-rink. Ida Turner,
who devised the decorations, apportioned
the whole of the northern end of the
ballroom as a v.-r. reserve, where, against
black velvet hangings, a forest of
almond-blossom was interspersed with
concealed pale-pink lights. The Dugans
arrived at 9.30, accompanied by their
staff. The huge committee of young
matrons and girls, in frocks every color
of the rainbow, formed a guard of honor
extending from the entrance to the dais.
Lady Dugan seems to favor pastel
tones. At her first appearance at the
Palais she wore pale-mauve chiffon ; on
this occasion her choice was a dainty
pinkish-maize chiffon, pintucked. A
string of pearls was her only ornament,
and she carried a bouquet of pink roses
and sweet-peas, presented to her on
arrival. Lud Mayor Cain was accom-
panied by his daughter, Mrs. H. Dun-
stan, who sported scarlet chiffon. Pre-
mier Butler’s pretty wife was smartly
gowned in black; Chief Secretary
Ritchie’s wife wore ruby chiffon velvet.
A symbolic pageant, arranged and pre-
sented by Heather Gill, in which over 100
took part, was a feature of the evening.
Later on in the programme came “The
Dance of the Debutantes,” which had
been arranged by Nora Stewart, followed
by a ballet under the direction of
Dorothy Slane.
Lady Dugan has every reason to be
impressed with the number of societies
we have in Adelaide. Nine banded to-
gether and had a big shivoo in the Town
Hall in her honor, and now 43 affiliated
organisations are to take part in a re-
ception and welcome in the Town Hall
arranged by the N.C.W.
The Music Salon’s opening crowded
the Wentworth. Prof. H. J. Wilkinson
in his brief speech of welcome to mem-
bers said over 170 had joined and many
others had expressed their intention of
doing so. Music and chatter formed the
programme. The night was frosty, and
most of the party wore their fur coats
over their evening frocks, while one lady
brought a footwarmer.
For the Aquinas Society’s dance in
the Uni. refectory, the decorations were
sweet-peas and irises. President Gunson
smiled on the proceedings, and many
young married people were among the
guests. Mrs. Alan Britten-Jones was
frocked in smart black lace, Mrs.
Eugene McLaughlin chose flowered green
chiffon and Mrs. J. O’Loghlin geranium-
red lace.
Scotch College, Torrens Park, burst
into festivity with a cabaret party of
which members of the Fathers’ Associa-
tion were hosts. Songs were sand-
wiched between the dances. Supper was
served in one of the classrooms, the
tables being decorated with irises.
WESTRALIA.
Black suiting was almost a uniform
with the fair sex at the opening of Par-
liament, but a colorful hat here and
there and many sets of luxuriant furs re-
lieved the monotony. The James lady
clasped an ermine necklet over her sombre
costume ; Mrs. Vernon Hammersley ran
a white stripe down hers ; Mrs. Geoffrey
Drake-Brockman’s disclosed a bright
blue-and-white plaid blouse. Mrs. Mc-
Intyre’s brown-and-beige outfit hostessed
knight John Kirwan’s tea-party ; Premier
Collier’s wife wound stone-martens
around Nile-blue matelasse; Lady Bird-
wood’s enveloping earth-brown fur coat
was topped with a knoll of moss-green
velvet; and Mrs. Panton presided over
teacups in the Speaker’s room in white-
circled navy foulard.
The committee of the Bankers’ Ball
had to close the subscription list at 600,
so good use was made of the floor of
Government House ballroom. The com-
mittee of men who had the doings in
hand left the ballets and exhibition
dances to Rene Esler. Manager R. A.
Love’s lady bowed graciously from a
swirl of ciel-blue moire and sovereign
lame; Mrs. Wreford’s black georgettes
were cloudy with fur; Mrs. Aylwin’s
bronzine laces were cloaked with deeper
green velvet; Mrs. Keeling’s turquoise
was in lush velvet; and Mrs. Yeldon
swung scarlet laces.
Katriona de Castilla delved into the
past to gown herself for her marriage
to Tom Letch. A crinoline that had
graced her grandmother 103 years ago
was pressed into service; its rich ivory
brocade, falling off the shoulders and
laced at the back, was moulded to a
pointed bodice with small puff sleeves,
then shirred voluminously at the hips.
The old Brussels-lace veil, which was
arranged straight across the head and
caught over the ears with blossom, was
made two centuries ago. Sheila Denny
and Marjorie Burnett struck a modem
note with coral-pink slinky crepes, slit
up the back and sleeved with flat frills.
Frilled pink tulle gauntlets clasped their
pastel posies. The Parish Hall, Clare-
mont, housed the 300 guests.
Twenty-four debs, spread their social
wings at the Catholic Ball at the Y.A.L.
Hall, and made their bows to Archbishop
Clune and Dr. Prendiville. A fanfare
of trumpets heralded the advent of the
young things, whose procession up the
aisle was preceded by three diminutive,
blue-organdied nymphs carrying posies.
These were bestowed on Mrs. J. P.
Maxwell, Mrs. Walter Dwyer and Mrs.
Dan Mulcahy, who presented the debs.
Two of the biggest private dances of
the season fell on the same evening. Mrs.
Merryweather celebrated daughter Betty’s
coming-of-age with a dance at the Em-
bassy, and the J. A. Collisters honored
twins Joan and Joyce’s nineteenth anni-
versary at the Karrakatta Club. Mrs.
Merryweather’s black chantillies and
velvet were offset with a posy of roses
at the corsage; Betty’s trained snowy
tulle frothed over satin with a trio of
frills at the hem, and an airy bertha
caught at the shoulder with a spray of
pink roses. The pink floral decorations
on the supper-tables spread to the birth-
day cake, which bloomed with 21 pink
carnations in lieu of candles.
The Collisters’ shivoo was a masquer-
ade, with identities strictly concealed till
the unmasking. Joan was a delightful
Madame Pompadour in her frills and
furbelows, and Joyce as intriguing as
Sheridan would have wished his Lady
Teazle. Mrs. Collister’s graceful black
georgettes and lace ushered in the twin
birthday cakes at midnight.
Sir William and Lady Birdwood, with
daughter Judith, disembarked from the
Cathay, crammed in a host of official and
private engagements, and then left with
their daughter and son-in-law, Mrs. and
Mr. Colin Craig, to spend a few weeks
at Boraming, near Williams.
Jo Rigg came back from holidaying
in the eastern States, announced her en-
gagement to Athole Fergusson-Stewart,
and, after a few days, surprised dancers
at Karrinyup Country Club by turning
up there to celebrate the knot-tying at
St. Luke’s, Cottesloe.
TASMANIA.
The A.I.F. Ball in the Albert Hall,
Launceston, attracted a record number
of dancers. His Ex. and Lady Clark were
there; also the Prime Minister and Mrs.
Lyons, the State Commandant and Mrs.
Whitham, Lieut.-Com. F. W. Heriot and
Mrs. Heriot, and a throng of other naval,
military and Parliamentary folk.
Scotch College, Launceston, ran its
ball in the Albert Hall. Officials and
invited guests were made comfy on a
low dais. Mrs. Briggs, wife of the prin-
cipal, wore black lace with a train and
a short velvet coatee ; Mayoress Hollings-
worth chose black satin and gold lame.
Small children held the floor in the early
hours, and a pipe band was among the
attractions.
His Ex., who was accompanied by
Lady Clark, opened the new wing of St.
John’s Hospital, which was dedicated by
Bishop Hay. The building is roomy, well-
lighted and up to date in every particu-
lar, an immense improvement on Hobart’s
older hospital accommodation.
A bridge drive for the Queen Alex-
andra Hospital was staged at the Con-
tinental, and produced a fat cheque, with
few expenses to be deducted. Nearly 100
tables were filled, and many more were
paid for. Almond-blossom, narcissi and
mauve iris brought spring into the rooms.
The Fred Downies gave a very jolly
party at their country home, Glenelg,
beyond New Norfolk, for daughter Faith.
Carloads of young things rolled up from
town and the surrounding district. Mrs.
Downie looked handsome in black
chiffon velvet and silver lace, and Faith’s
frock was of green flat crepe and gold
lame.
Angus Henry and Lesley Freeman
were made one at St. George’s, Battery
Point, with a minimum of fuss, only in-
timate friends and relatives being bidden
to the ceremony. The bride’s frock was
of palest pink chiffon velvet; her long
tulle veil fell from a halo caught with
orange-blossoms. Rosalin Cloak ’maided
in pale-green velvet with a train and a
little velvet headdress.

Do Women Players Compare with
Men?
BY DR. H. L. TONKIN.
This question has been put by a cor-
respondent, and as it is always cropping
up I am going to risk an opinion.
My experience is that the best of
our women players do not quite come
up to the standard of our best men. For
one thing, while no player can alwavs
expect to be at his top, I think that
women are more inconsistent than men
1 know two or three ladies who, at
their best, are more brilliant than any
men I have seen, but over a period
of time their percentage of error
is greater than that of most men
of similar standard. This is not
due to any physical defect; they are
just as healthy and should not have any
more worries than the male. It is not.
caused by lack of practice, for they have
more time for the gam-e than most men.
I attribute it partly to lack of thought
and the habit of playing too quickly. I
would be the last to advocate prolonged
study of every card before parting with
it, but I do contend that situations arise
where deliberation is essential to get the
best results.
The placing of important cards and
the counting of opponents’ hands require
time, even from the expert, especially
against players who are using every wile
to deceive you. There are many deals
where four or five seconds can be well
spent in this at the commencement of
play, and men seem to have absorbed
the lesson better than women.
I think, also, the ladies are liable to
be more upset by reverses. Plenty of
men show the same failing in competi-
tion bridge, but not, I think, to quite the
same extent as women. Don’t think
that I am accusing the other sex of
crumpling up too readily ; it is not just
bad luck which seems to upset them, but
bad results caused by their own errors.
1 have often noticed that if a fine woman
player handles a deal with less than her
usual skill she is likely to be affected
by it over the next two or three hands.
That feeling of annoyance is common
to most of us ; the only thing to do is
to train oneself to dismiss the recollec-
tion and concentrate on the play of the
moment. Notwithstanding the fore-
going, there are lady players whom
I would gladly have as partners against
the best men I know —that is, if any of
them will accept me after this.
Influenza and Psychic Bids.
The influenza which has whirled round
the continent may be blamed for many
things, but the following is the only in-
stance in my knowledge where it has
been responsible for increasing a doubled
contract. At a friend’s house last week
this deal occurred:
North dealer, both vulnerable, and North
and East suffering from heavy influenzal
colds!
North bid one heart; East, instead of
doubling, said two diamonds. South
cheerily went to three clubs, and West
started to think. With South failing to
support the hearts, he reasoned that
North’s off-suit might be spades. If he
could induce a double of four diamonds
the game looked good. He started his
plan, therefore, with a bid of three
spades.
North rather dolefully doubled. Owing
to impaired hearing, the double escaped
East altogether, and after some con-
sideration he called four spades. West
concealed his distress as best he could,
and when South doubled he had to re-
strain himself from calling too quickly.
Then he went to five diamonds, and was
duly doubled by North. East unfortu-
nately heard this one, and sat back to
think, while West’s face was worth a
snapshot. However, East decided to pass,
and South led his heart king, which as-
sured the contract. A club or a spade
lead would have defeated it with normal
play, for East is certain to finesse against
North for the missing heart honor.
West’s scheme of trapping his oppo-
nents into a double of four diamonds
was good tactics. It will be seen that,
unless North-South start looking for
penalties, it is impossible for them to
lose a five-club contract.
The Olympic Trophy.
The old combination of lawyer-doctor
has once again sustained its reputation.
This time it was at contract bridge, in
opposition to the rest of Australia. Mr.
R. Keon-Cohen and Dr. T. Allen, of
Melbourne, put up a wonderfully fine
performance in easily winning the Aus-
tralian division of the Culbertson Olym-
pic contest. Their score of 80 per cent,
was a long way in front of anything
achieved in Sydney.

So far as the people of Australia understand it, they think that when
our policy, known as the Lang Plan, was issued in February, it started a run
on the Bank which finished in April when the Bank suspended payment
In this Lang is right. The people will continue to think that Lang’s policy
destroyed the G.S.B. so long as they remember that the Lang Plan provided
for the repudiation of debts and the deliberate refusal to pay interest. No
wonder the depositors became nervous.
Peopie also remember that the Lang Government owed the
Bank £2,600,000, including £432,000 for overdue interest, and
continued to owe this money whilst the Bank’s doors were closed
against depositors who had placed their trust in the Government’s
guarantee of their deposits.

Out of the Past.
THE PEACE-OFFICER.
BY J. H. M. ABBOTT.
THE night was very still and hot when
Constable Denis O’Riordan, of the
New Police, took up his duties for
the first time. Down in the Cove, the
lights of the single ship then in port
reflected themselves in motionless black
waters, and on the Rocks, where the con-
stable stood contemplating the town
below him, not a breath of air was
moving.
A red-headed Irishman of twenty-five
was Constable O’Riordan —muscular,
athletic and well-built. He had not been
long in N. S. Wales, and did not want
to be there at all.
Ireland in 1813 was suffering under
more than one grievous hardship. Eng-
lish coercive measures had made life a
hell, and there was no escape out of it to
America, since England was at war with
the United States and her cruisers barred
that only road to freedom. So there was
no great joy in being an Irishman on his
native sod—but much less, in the estima-
tion of Mr. O’Riordan, in being a com-
pulsory Australian. And on account of
such a trifle!
There had been a few words over the
vending of a horse between Mr. O’Rior-
dan and a fellow called Brady, believed
to be an informer. Brady had been ex-
ceedingly aggravating. His veiled insults
and semi-threats would have tried the
temper of a saint. When he informed
the crowd gathered about them to watch
the bargaining in the market-place of
Ballyharrich that Denis O’Riordan was
contemplating marriage with a Protestant
Englishwoman, it had been too much.
Mr. O’Riordan had tapped Brady on
the hat with his blackthorn. It was the
merest tap; yet the fool had tumbled
down and died on the spot.
To Denis’s amazement he had been
arrested that night and charged with
murder. None but the hirelings of the
English Government would have done
such a thing.
They tried their best to hang him, but
the evidence of the doctor who con-
ducted the post-mortem showed that
Brady had really died of a weak heart.
So the infamous English Judge who pre-
sided over the Cork Assizes had sent him
to Botany Bay for fourteen years.
However, no sooner was the ship
anchored in Port Jackson than Mr.
D’Arcy Wentworth, Superintendent of
Police, knowing a good man when he
saw one, had come aboard and selected
him to be a constable. So here he was,
up on the Rocks on this stifling evening,
thinking his sad thoughts and wondering
vaguely what he was to do and how he
was to do it. But, as had been pointed
out to him, it was better to be one of
Governor Macquarie’s and Mr. Went-
worth’s New Police than to be a mem-
ber of a road gang. He would bide his
time, and his chance would surely come
of proving that he could be as good a
policeman as any of them.
The New Police were one of the
earliest creations of Governor Mac-
quarie. When he landed in Sydney at
the end of 1809 he found a great deal
that was not as it should be, and very
little that was. Sydney was built any-
how, and its citizens behaved anyhow.
So he proceeded immediately to
straighten out the streets (a little), and
then set about the somewhat more diffi-
cult task of straightening up the
people.
With the chaotic jumble of houses built
along the crooked “rows” running more
or less parallel with the Tank Stream, he
was moderately successful. He made
proper streets where there had only been
haphazard thoroughfares and rights-of-
way, and gave them most of the names
they bear to-day. Sydney is irregular
enough as we know it—that is part of
its charm —but if it had not been for
Macquarie’s peremptory town-planning
the oider portion of it, in the neighbor-
hood of Sydney Cove and along the
valley of the ancient creek that con-
stituted its first water-supply, would have
been the queerest urban district in the
world.
But with the inhabitants he had harder
work, and not such good results. He took
from the garrison the task of keeping
order, conferring it upon a body of con-
stables recruited from the ranks of old
soldiers, sailors and such prisoners of
the Crown as might be looked upon as
reasonably trustworthy. Sometimes they
were and sometimes they weren’t.
He divided the town into five police
districts, in each of which were erected
a watch-house and lockup, with a
District Constable in charge. Ordi-
nary constables were assigned to do what
is now termed “beat” duty. Over all was
a Chief Constable, responsible to the
Superintendent of Police, Mr. D’Arcy
Wentworth, who was also empowered to
discharge the functions of police magis-
trate. His powers are nowadays some-
what staggering to contemplate. Take,
for instance, paragraphs 5 and 6 of
Section 6 of Macquarie’s extraordinarily
comprehensive “Police Regulations”:
That he shall have the power of punish-
ing every prisoner duly convicted before
him, upon the oath of one or more credible
persons, of wilful neglect of work, of
being abroad during the night after the
limited hours, or of being intoxicated in
the publick streets at any time, by pub-
lick whipping, not exceeding fifty lashes,
and also by confining such persons to hard
labor for any time not exceeding thirty
days.
That he shall have the power of punish-
ing all persons whatsoever, duly convicted
as above of being idle and disorderly
persons, by publick whipping and confine-
ment to hard labor, as above.
From this it will be seen what an
important personage Constable O’Riordan
really was in 1813 as he pondered his
procedure that evening on the Rocks.
Constable O’Riordan was armed with
a cutlass of the navy pattern and a
watchman’s rattle —equivalent of the
modern police whistle. He wore a blue,
red-cuffed jacket with tails, white canvas
trousers and a flat cap with a glazed peak,
and, being of soldierly build, did not
look anything but smart and efficient.
The nine-o’clock gun booming out
from Dawes’ Battery, down at the end
of the point, reminded him that the hour
of closing had arrived for ale-houses, rum-
shanties and ta' erns. He moved off south-
ward. So long as the front door of a
licensed house was closed, the windows
veiled and the conduct of the customers
moderately decorous, drinking might con-
tinue all night, so far as the police were
concerned. But it was strictly enjoined
upon members of the force that every
foot-passenger in the streets after gun-
fire must be regarded as a potential
felon.
The officer sauntered slowly along the
crest of the ridge, the cutlass in its black
leather scabbard swinging against his left
leg, and the cumbersome rattle in his
hand. People passed him, hurrying home
with jugs of beer in their hands, but,
since the instructions of his District Con-
stable had enjoined him to give the citi-
zens half an hour’s grace in repairing to
the domestic hearth, he saw no occasion
to interfere. All the inn doors were
shut, and the town was very quiet.
His district was “Number 2.” It ex-
tended from Surrey-lane on the north to
the Military Barracks on the south, with
its eastern and western limits on the
shores of Sydney Cove and Cockle Bay
(Darling Harbor) respectively.
It was the hub of the town. On its
eastern side were the shipping and Gov-
ernment offices and the establishments of
such leading merchants as Messrs. Under-
wood, Lord, Campbell, Reibey and
others. Up on the Rocks were many
private houses of a better sort, and not
a few drinking dens of the worser.
Whilst its divisions of caste were strict
and inexorable, Sydney society was aston-
ishingly mixed. The Very Best people
found themselves living cheek by jowl
with the Very Worst. A Commissary-
General might be the neighbor of a
doubly-convicted felon who had only

Why we have two sets
of teeth; what to do to
make them strong and
keep them healthy;
why some children eat
chalk or mud; how to
protect teeth from de-
cay after they come
through the gums.

Milk is oat of the finest foods known
for building hard teeth because it is
rich in calcium.
A drawing of a child’s jaw showing
how the permanent teeth form be-
neath the baby teeth and gradually
push the latter upward until they
loosen and come out easily.
THE celebrated first tooth
that causes mother such
excitement and gives father
such pride is really months old
when it breaks through the
gums. For we now find that
teeth begin to form months
before birth and continue to form long
afterwards. Thus scientific men now
believe it possible to actually “build”
strong teeth by having the baby as well
as the adult eat the proper food.
The harder and thicker the enamel of
the teeth, the more resistant they are to
decay. Therefore nutritionists tell, ex-
pectant mothers to eat plentifully of
foods containing lime and phosphorus
and certain vitamins so that the baby
will have good teeth. They advise
mothers to feed children tooth-building
foods in large quantities. Milk, oranges,
cod-liver oil are some of these tooth-
building foods.
Dental science explains that decay is
caused by particles of food that lodge on
teeth and under the edges of the gums.
This food is spoiled by certain bacteria.
As it decays, acids are formed which
destroy tooth surfaces. After eating
through the tooth’s hard enamel cover-
ing, these acids proceed to decay the
inner part of the tooth until finally the
nerve is reached and the entire tooth
affected.

The roots of baby
or first teeth are-
gradually dissolved
and absorbed by
the body, probably
to be used again in
building the per-
manent teeth. Roots
of second teeth are
not absorbed.
One of the scientific methods
of preventing decay after
teeth have once come through
the gums is to remove from
teeth the film, or bacterial
plaque. Film is that slippery,
sticky substance that forms on
teetli. You can feel it with your tongue.
Film is a friend of the germs that cause
decay-producing acids. It glues germs
to the teeth, provides them with a warm
shelter . . . even supplies germs with
food on which to live and multiply.
Thus removing film from teeth means
removing the cause of decay. Important
progress in removing film was made
recently in the laboratories of The Pepso-
dent Company when a new, revolution-
ary cleansing material was developed.
The cleansing and polishing material
is the part of any tooth paste that does
the work. Most cleansing materials are
so hard and abrasive that they scratch
the tooth enamel. Here is the difference
between the best tooth paste and in-
ferior brands.
The new Pepsodent cleansing material
is twice as soft as the material com-
monly used in tooth pastes. Pepsodent
Tooth Paste is unsurpassed in cleansing
power and safety.
That is why Pepsodent is known in
67 countries as the special “film-
removing tooth paste.”

escaped the gallows by the merest fluke.
Suddenly the stillness of the night was
shattered by a prodigious uproar. Con-
stable O'Riordan involuntarily dropped
his rattle and drew his cutlass as he
bounded forward in the direction of the
startling and appalling row.
Yells, loud cursings, the slamming of
doors and the clatter of overturning fur-
niture mingled in the discord. Minor
noises of all description helped to swell
it. Dogs barked, women screamed, and
some unknown contributor to the unholy
chorus beat upon a frying-pan, or some
such metal utensil, with a club. The
mingled sounds were unmistakably the
sounds of battle—battle that was fierce
and ruthless and bitter.
As he ran up and over the hilltop
towards Cockle Bay, Constable O'Rior-
dan gasped: “’Tis at Black Tom Nut-
ting’s—’tis at th’ Good Intint.”
The Good Intent Inn lay behind the
north-west corner of the barrack-wall,
slightly northward of it, and not very
far from where the round tower of St.
Phillip’s Church marked the ecclesiastical
centre of Sydney. It was a place where
anything might happen. And the licensee
was as evil as the house. Transported,
in Governor King’s time, Thomas Nut-
ting was capable of any villainy.
A long, low, thatched stone cottage
his den was, with outbuildings behind
it that were enclosed within a rectangle
of six-foot rubble wall. It stood on one
side of a little irregular open space
where grew stunted gum-trees and
patches of scrub, and across which well-
beaten tracks led in several directions to
its front door.
As the constable doubled along one
of these, he collided violently with a man
who came running from the inn.
They both jecoiied a couple of paces,
having almost knocked each other over.
“Damn ye, out o’ my way!” gasped
the man.
Constable O’Riordan whirled the naked
cutlass above his shoulders, threatening
to cut down the assaulter of the police.
The other raised his arm to shield his
head, and yelled a hasty cry for quarter.
“Don’t hit me, constable. I’m going
for th’ sojers. ’Tis a shindy would take
th’ main guard to stop. They’re killin'
one another, an’ wreckin’ my public.
Lemme get to th’ guard-house.”
O’Riordan stayed his hand.
“What is ut, thin?” he grunted, block-
ing the other’s way. “Such goin’s on are
not allowed, Misther Nutting, as well, ye
know. I misdoubt ye’ll lose y’r licinse
over ut. Come back wid me now!
What’s it all about?”
“I tell ye, constable, ’twill take a comp’ny
o’ sojers for to stop ’em. Ye’ve no more
hope o’ doin’ it than ye have o’ jumpin’
from here into th’ Cove. ’Tis Cath’lics
an’ Prof stans, sojers an’ pris’ners,
free men an’ sailors, all mixed up.
They’re wreckin’ th’ place, an’ tryin’ for
to kill each other. It started with a
word. Patsy Donovan calls Bill Tacker,
th’ Lane Cove timber-getter, a heretic —
but there’s th’ drums beating the ‘alarm’
in th’ barrack-square.”
Constable O’Riordan stood on the
starlit hillside and considered the situa-
tion for a few seconds.
“ ’Tis th’ Irish an’ th’ Cath’lics agin’
th rist?” he asked.
“Yes,” replied the other. “That’s it —-
a releejous row.”
“An’ who’s winnin’?”
“There’s scarce a dozen o’ th’ Cath’lics,
an’ twenty or thirty on the other side.
They’ll pull me house down. Come with
me, an’ we’ll fetch th’ sojers. They’re
me on’y ’ope.”
“No!” roared Constable O’Riordan.
“I’ll do me juty.” He ran towards the inn.
Black Tom Nutting stared a moment
after the policeman ; then he turned and
ran down a track that would lead him
to the main guard-house, at the corner of
George and Grosvenor streets.
His Excellency the Governor, but just
come out from breakfast, his napkin in
his hand, stood on the verandah of Gov-
ernment House in serious conversation
with Mr. D’Arcy Wentworth. Sum-
moned by an orderly to the Presence, the
superintendent had hastily repaired to
the big cottage on the hillside above the
Cove, across whose blue waters the gaze
of his Excellency and of himself was
turned towards the town as they dis-
cussed the riot of the previous evening.
“And have you many prisoners, Mr.
Wentworth?” the Governor was asking.
“We must make an example. Such
blackguardism cannot be tolerated for a
moment. How many were arrested?”
“About a dozen, your Excellency. But
there are three or four in the hos-
pital, and two others, who have suc-
cumbed to their injuries, in the dead-
house. It seems to have been a very
serious business.”
“And what was the reason for this out-
break of violence? It must have been
terrific. Mrs. Macquarie and I could
hear it from here. More than a mere
tavern brawl, I take it?”
Mr. Wentworth nodded.
“The Chief Constable tells me, your
Excellency, that about a dozen Irish
timber-getters were drinking in the Good
Intent Inn, of which Thomas Nutting
holds the license, in the company of
nearly twice as many people from all
parts of the town and all conditions of
society. Some dispute arose, and it de-
veloped into a sectarian argument. Then
into a free fight, in which all the Irish
were on one side and the rest of the
company on the other. It seems to have
been a most bloodthirsty affray. Only
when a party of the military from the ;
barracks arrived could order be restored.
And then only with great difficulty.
“One of the two persons fatally in-
jured was bayoneted by a soldier. The
sergeant-major, who himself accom-
panied the detachment, has informed
Mr. Rooney that the soldier had no
option but to use his bayonet, being
attacked most savagely by his victim with
an iron bar.”
“Most unfortunate,” sighed Macquarie.
“This sort of thing must be put down.
How did the New Police behave? Were
any of them concerned in the affair?”
Mr. Wentworth beamed.
“Only one man, your Excellency—a
recruit but lately arrived in the colony.
Attracted from his post by the sounds
of disorder, he charged into the midst of
the riot, and it was owing to his
courageous conduct that seven of the
rioters were placed under arrest. Rooney
speaks very highly of him. Recommends
him to me for speedy promotion. 1
shall make it my business to interview
him, and to commend him for his good
behavior. I am happy to say that I
myself selected him on board the trans-
port Lady Portland, upon her arrival
here a month ago.”
“Ah, a prisoner?”
“Yes, your Excellency—a young man
named O’Riordan. He was transported
for manslaughter ; but he assures me that
the affair was accidental. We could do
with more of this man’s sort in the force.
One is not always so fortunate.”
“Well, then, my dear Mr. Wentworth,
please to send him up to see me. I think
some reward from the Police Fund might
be a suitable recompense for such a good
and useful peace-officer. Possibly a
pardon, in a little while. What do you
think? Please be so good as to obtain
a report from the Chief Constable, and
send it to the Secretary, with your own.
And let O’Riordan come up here after
he has given his evidence. I would like
to see him.”
“Very good, your Excellency.”
“Well now, thin, Dinny, me bhoy,”
said Mr. Chief Constable Rooney to the
much battered Constable O’Riordan as
the latter limped into his office and
stood to attention before his superior
officer —“th’ Gov’nor’s sint for ye for to
thank ye for y’r foine behavior—th’ same
as I do, an’ all right-thinkin’ people in
th’ community. Ye done well. That big,
ugly Jawn Jones, th’ brickmaker, I heard
him say ‘lf it hadn’t been for that
flamin’ red-headed polisman a-goin’ in
on th’ soide o’ the Papishts we’d ha’
killed ’em.’ Well, Jawn’s now enjoyin'
fifty lashes, together wid his her’tic mates,
over in th’ gaol yard, an’ there’s not a
single wan o’ th’ thrue faith in th’ whole
dozen that’s takin’ it in turn at th’ tri-
angles. Mark that, Dinny, me bhoy!
All Protestan’s an’ Sassenachs. I’ve said
in me report to th’ Soper, that ye’re th’
very eyedale of a peace-officer. Go ye
now to his Excellency, an’ rape y’r just
reward.”
Solemnly, Chief Constable Rooney
winked at his subordinate. Painfully,
Constable O’Riordan closed one of his
blackened eyes as an acknowledgment.
He saluted and went out, proud in the
consciousness of having done his duty.
Unchosen.
1 have given my heart to Beauty, whose name
I now confess;
She, who is mistress of a world that loves
her little or less,
Has chained me as she tethers a star to the
nethermost reach of sky:
1 have given my heart to Beauty—and she has
passed me by.
Yet shall I know my service scorned, insen-
sible of blame,
Who came with such unskilful hand to tend
her sacred flame?
While in her courts her mighty, ones fling music
to the sky,
How could she heed a minstrel who plucked
a lute awry?
Oh, I am the fool of Beauty, as the veriest
fool of Love;
She has laid a spell upon me no litany may
move.
I would have been her lowliest so that her
throne were nigh :
1 have given her my heart, my heart—and she
has passed me by!

Strength Stability
Built Upon Confidence
The whole structure of our financial system is
built upon public confidence.
The big financial institutions are the trustees oi
the people's savings and are big only because
of the trust and confidence reposed in them by
hundreds of thousands of Australian citizens.
The individual, by entrusting his money to a
bank, an insurance or trustee company, thus
expresses his confidence in the institution which
he selects to safeguard his savings.
Public confidence is maintained only so long as
these institutions invest soundly and administer
wisely the funds entrusted to their care.
These funds are placed at the disposal oi pro-
ducers, traders and governments and are the
source out of which the country's production
and trade is financed and employment found
for its people.
The interests of depositors and policy-holders
and the interests of the financial institutions are
so closely related that an attack on any cus-
todian of the people's savings is an attack on
the people themselves.

The Promise.
BY GEOFFREY HARRY.
THOSE who discover Mount Gambier
on a sunny autumn day should be
overwhelmed with the beauty they
find there. If they are not, then assuredly
they are fit only for treasons, stratagems,
spoils, politics and stone-cracking.
| I felt that I was fit for higher things
I than these when I walked up the long
! rise from the town and looked down on
the still waters of Valley Lake far below
me.
Here was rare and peaceful beauty, a
sort of solatium offered by nature for
the volcanic disruption which, ages ago,
it had caused. I sat down at a point
where the crater side fell almost sheer
hundreds of feet to the lake. So far as a
limited artistic perception would allow,
I absorbed the beauty of the place, the
coloring of the surrounding cliffs, the
pine-clad slopes of the crater’s further
side and the sleeping lake. Then I de-
parted from my own artistic standards
by falling asleep myself.
I awoke to the murmur of conversa-
tion a few yards from where I was lying.
A girl and a man were talking, and the
conversation came to me clearly. They
had apparently been talking for some
time, and after hearing the first few
words I decided that less embarrassment
would be caused to all concerned if I
stayed unnoticed where I was.
The girl said, “When are we going to
get married, Jim?”
He said, “I can’t get married, Lorna.
My pay barely keeps me, let alone two
of us.”
“I can keep on working,” she urged.
“I don’t want my wife to work,” he
answered. “If I couldn’t support the
woman I married, I wouldn’t marry.”
They were silent for a few moments,
sitting on a seat in my full view. The
girl was amazingly pretty, bareheaded,
her auburn hair glinting in the sun like
red gold. Her companion was a sallow,
pasty-faced, unimaginative-looking youth
with lank black hair.
“Jim,” she said after a short silence,
whilst they both stared out over the
lake, “we can’t go on like we are. There
was a time before I met you when it
would have shocked me. I’m not quite
so girlishly innocent now, but I can’t
see how we’ll ever get any lasting happi-
ness unless we marry.”
His voice was in sharp contrast to the
deep modulation of hers.
“You don’t know what you are talk-
ing about, Lorna. We’re all right as we
are. I’ll get enough money some day.
Don’t go spoiling things.” His voice
trailed away into a whine.
She turned to him, and her magnificent
eyes seemed to blaze.
“Are you playing around with anyone
else?” she asked fiercely ; and there was
a grating tone in her voice.
“What if I was?” Again that whine,
with a note of petulance in it.
“Only this,” she said deliberately and
never removing her eyes from him; “if
you do, and I get to hear of it, I’ll kill
you. That’s no threat. It’s a promise.”
He laughed nervously.
“1 believe you would, too. Well, don’t
worry, I’m not going to, anyway.”
She persisted.
“Don’t forget what I said, Jim. I can
make something of you if you’ll let me.
You don’t want to be a wages man
all your life. You know how I love you
—but you try any funny business
and”
“Well,” he interrupted, “we’d better be
getting back. I’m cold.”
They moved away, their voices dying
in the distance.
The lake below, its motionless surface
darkly shadowed as the sun declined,
seemed to me somehow to have become
sinister. Perhaps, I thought as I walked
back to my hotel, the conversation which
I had involuntarily overheard had con-
tributed to this impression. However, an
excellent dinner, combined with a pint
of good beer, soon dispelled my uneasi-
ness, and for the time being I forgot the
incident.
Years later I visited Mount Gambier
again. In the interval I had often casu-
ally wondered as to the ultimate marital
destiny of the strangely-assorted pair
whose conversation I had overheard
above the lake.
Some male curiosity had prompted a
desire for closer acquaintance with the
girl, even after that lapse ol time. One
i of my few qualifications is a memory
for faces which would be an asset to a
detective or a hotel proprietor, and *
knew that if I saw the girl again I should
recognise her.
One evening a few days after my
arrival, an acquaintance, a public ser-
vant, invited me to his house. After
dinner we sat on the wide veran-
dah overlooking the town at the foot of'
the mount. I had taken a few apprecia-
tive puffs at my cigarette when I noticed,
walking along the street which bounds
the house in front, the auburn-haired
girl of the lake.
I drew my host’s attention to her.
“Do you know who that is?” I asked.
“I think I saw her last time I was here.”
“Quite possible,” he replied. “She
lives here. Her name’s Lorna Felspar.
She’s married, and she’s done quite well
for herself —rules her husband with a
rod of iron, they say. Incidentally,
they’ve got two of the handsomest kids
I’ve ever seen.”
“Ah, yes,” I said intelligently, not
knowing whether my feeling was one of
disappointment or relief.
“There’s a bit of a mystery about her.
She was engaged to a chap named
Mawby. Useless, good-for-nothing fellow.
Don’t know how a girl like her ever saw
anything in him. You may wonder why
I gossip. If you lived in a small town
you’d gossip, too.”
I made deprecating noises, but he didn’t
seem to notice.
“Anyway, about the mystery, if you
can call it that. This chap was no good.
After he’d been going around with Lorna
Galena —as she was then—for quite a
while he got into a mess with a good-for-
nothing little bit in the town who put it
across him that he would have to marry
her.
“It must have been a hell of a position
for the fellow. Engaged to one girl
(and what a girl!), and prompted by what-
ever honorable motives he had to marry
the other. As it turned out, the other
was merely pulling a bluff, but, of course,
no one concerned knew that then. He
decided to marry the one he’d got into
trouble. On a matter of honor, I sup-
pose, he can be said to have done the
right thing, but he must have suffered.
“Anyway, to cut it short, one afternoon
a couple of days before the marriage was
to take place, Lorna Galena walked into
the police station and calmly announced
that Jim Mawby had fallen into Valley
Lake. Of course, there was a hullabaloo.
Had she tried to save him? Where had
he fallen in? And so on.
“They found him dead. He’d fallen
200 feet into the lake and had hit the
crater side several times en route.
“Naturally, there was an inquest. She
told her story quite calmly. They had
been walking together along the top,
when he had lost his footing and fallen.
“Had she tried to save him? No, she
couldn’t. Could she explain the scarred
surface of the ground at the spot from
which he was said to have fallen? No.
Did she not think that it seemed to indi-
cate a struggle of some sort? She didn't
know.
“Had she ever been to that spot with
Mawby before? Yes, many times. They
used to sit on a seat there and talk. Had
she a grudge against him on account of
the marriage? Yes, she had. Had she
wanted to marry him herself? Not after
she had heard of the other affair. She
had immediately broken off their engage-
ment.
“Why had she gone with him to the
lake lookout that afternoon? Just
a sort of farewell talk. Could she explain
his death? No.”
He paused for breath.
“Where is this place where the death
occurred?” I asked, knowing the answer.
“This side of the Valley Lake. There’s
a seat there almost on the edge of the
cliff. It has been fenced off since Mawby’s
death. Do you know where I mean?”
Oh, yes, I knew exactly. I had gone
to sleep while admiring the view there one
day some years before. “And what was
the finding?” I inquired casually.
“Accidental death,” my host replied.
“There couldn’t have been any other in
the circumstances. There were no eyewit-
nesses except herself, and it was impos-
sible to prove any definite motive. She
may have had one. She may have been
guilty. I don’t know. In any case no
jury could have convicted.”
“No,” I said. But I thought of the de-
pression which had seized me at the
sight of that timeless waiting water when
1 left it.

The Forgotten Factor
BY P. B. SLOCIM.
I" 1 HE relief-workers had been in the
street for three months, and the
nerves of the residents were becom-
ing frayed. The inconvenience caused
by dust and mud looked like being per-
manent. Heaped dirt blocked gateways,
and a stretch of water-main lay naked to
the day. A woman outside whose front
gate a gang had been located for weeks
replied to an inquiry for the time:
“Never mind the time ; do some work
and get away. We’re sick of the sight of
you!”
The workers downed tools to hear
what Sam had to say about it. Sam had
boasted that he was a Red.
“Sick of the sight of us, are they?” said
Sam. “And who put us here? You didn’t,
or you, or you.” His glare darted impar-
tially over his listeners.- “You’re where
you’re wanted to be—you’re slaves, and
you squeal when somebody gives it to
you in the neck. These women will be
spitting on you next, and you’ll have to
let ’em.”
Sam spoke feelingly. He had had a
steady run of odd jobs. They had not
been interfered with by his attendance for
a few minutes each fortnight at the relief
depot to arrange for his food supply,
but they had been wholly disorganised
when the Government claimed his ser-
vices for five days in every fourteen.
Disappointed, the workers took up
their tools.
“Y’ always talk that stuff,” growled
Bob. “What’s this direct action your
cobbers mag so much about?”
Sam bristled. “What do you want to
do? Pelt rocks on her roof?”
“Let ’em see they can’t talk to us like
that. Show ’em”
“Horses ; horses again! ” From the
crest of a heap of mullock the ganger
was looking down on them.
‘'Wrong ; wrong again! ” chirped Bob.
"We asked an old sheilah the time, and
she said they were sick of the sight of
us.”
“I don’t wonder. Well, they won’t
have you much longer. The street has got
to be finished this week. The Water Board
men will be here immediately after dinner
to lower those pipes ; that gives us to-
morrow and next day. So shake a leg
and get that place cleaned up. Stack
the ballast on the footpath.”
The ganger spoke half-heartedly, as
if he knew he was wasting his breath.
He had given Sam and his cobbers up as
a bad job. Whenever he looked at them
he thought of how near he had come to
laughing in the face of an alderman who
said, “We will be satisfied if we get
eighty per cent, efficiency from our
relief-workers.” His council hadn’t
wanted the relief-workers, believing them
to be the Government’s responsibility ;
but, having got them, it hoped to make
the best of a bad bargain.
He had suggested that it ask to pick its
men.
The Government had said “All or
none.”
Sixty per cent, was unfitted for the
work ; they were willing, but willingness
was not enough to shift mullock and
chop rock profitably. From the remainder
he was getting some return —now that he
had weeded out of the gangs the
shrewdies, won’t-works and magsmen and
put them where they would do the least
harm to the smallest number.
He ran an appraising eye over the work
of the twelve below him. Two good men
would have done as much. He often
wondered what jobs they had had. By
their conversation, most of them were tip-
slingers and urgers. Horses were all they
thought of.
“I’ll get that greasy cow,” said Sam
when the ganger was out of hearing.
But how? Inspiration came to him
when he bumped his head on the water-
main as he was listlessly lifting a quarter-
pound lump of sandstone.
He examined the big pipe. Rusty! He
looked about him. The section of the
street in which they were working was a
wide, shallow trough, its bottom and sides
of solid rock. A few holes in the water-
main and there would be no work that
afternoon, probably none next day—only
bailing out.
Leaning on a shovel, Sam thought over
his scheme. He’d need helpers. He had
already done his bit towards damaging
the council’s- property —by using picks
as crowbars and pushing barrows over
cuttings so that they’d fall on boulders—
but he wasn’t sure how he’d stand with
Water Board property. Better to distri-
bute the blame. He was sure of Bob,
but not so sure about the others. Then he
remembered the advice of a master at
whose feet he had sat: “Don’t waste your
breath when you want to get a mob
thinking your way. Pick a few hardheads
and tell them what you want. They’ll do
the rest.” He’d leave it to Bob.
“If that shovel-handle breaks and goes
through your chest you won’t get com-
pensation, remember!”
Sam started, spat “Basket!” in the
ganger’s direction and called to Bob,
“Want to see you at smoke-oh.”
“Good-oh,” returned Bob. “How’s the
tucker-bag? I’ve got no scran till dinner-
time. The old lady’s out for the day, so
she didn’t get anything in. Thought I’d
have money—and it’s nearly a week since
pay-day! I had to nip her for a deener
to buy my dinner. I’ll be there.”
Bob wasn’t there, however. Bob
had last been seen in the wake of an s.-p.
bookmaker.
“Backed Bluetail,” said Bob when he
returned. “Only a deener. All 1 had.”
Sam drew him aside. “Forget about
your dam’ horses a minute and listen.
You wanted action. Here it is.”
As Sam unfolded his plot Bob’s eyes
danced. “I’m with you,” he said. “Gimme
a pick.”
“Steady. We’re not going to do it yet.
I want to know how the others’ll be.”
“Soon find out.” Bob put the scheme
as his own.
“Do the holes one at a time,” suggested
Joe. “I’m a plumber, and I’ll get a trey
an hour extra while I’m mending ’em.
Other gangs do”
“Like hell!” ejaculated Sam.
The rest were easy, they said ; except
Bill and Jack, who thought it would be
rough on the ganger: they’d blame him
if the street wasn’t finished. “It’s the
people we’re out to get, isn’t it?” they
asked.
“Doesn’t he represent them?” de-
manded Sam. “What—hell!”
The sound of a loud explosion had
come from the park.
“Some blast, that!” exclaimed Bob as
they watched a cloud of smoke and dust
drift away from a patch of shattered
rock.
Discussion followed on the lousiness of
the council, which was speeding up the
work by firing ten holes at once with a
battery.
“We ought to put the boot into that
dam’ battery,” said Bob. “Kick its guts
out! ”
Before they could consider Bob’s sug-
gestion the lady who had refused to tell
them the time claimed their attention.
From her gate she was yelling for the
ganger.
“That blasting has killed all my birds!”
she said. Six lovebirds were dead, and i
she wanted to know what the ganger was
going to do about it.
“Don’t bother about him,” said Sam.
“He’ll put you off to save himself. It’s
his fault. Write to the council and com-
plain. Claim a pound a bird. It’s dis-
graceful! It’s a wonder your house
wasn’t shaken down. Go and write the
letter now, before you forget it.”
As the lady turned to go in, Bob asked
her what she was going to do with the
birds. Surprised, she said she was going
to bury them.
“Give ’em to me to make a pie for my
Sunday dinner,” said Bob. “If you don’t
I’ll have to kill my cat.”
As though afraid she’d forget herself,
the lady fled.
“Teach her to tell the time when she’s
asked again!” Bob grinned.
“Here’s what we do,” said Sam as
they clambered down about the main and
its attendant service pipes. “When they
blow us up for dinner, we hang back and
let the mob get into the shelter-shed.
Then we belt the pipe. No one’s likely
to notice it for a while, and there’ll be
no hope of getting the mob out once
they’ve started eating. Besides, it’ll take
time to get someone to turn the water
off; the turncock’s generally missing
when he’s wanted.”
“A few holes in the side will give the
women’s verandahs a wash-down,” sug-
gested Bob.
“Better put ’em underneath,” said Sam.
“It’ll look as if we bumped the pipe acci-
dentally when we were lifting our picks.”
“I'd better get out of here, then,”
laughed Bill, who was standing in a hole,
“or the ganger will never swallow that
tale. He reckons he can tell the time
by watching how high a relief-worker
lifts his pick. Two foot’s eight o’clock,
six inches is half-past eleven.”

from here, and that’d crab the show.”
Abandoning their customary practice
of standing shoulder to shoulder and
passing the lumps of stone from hand to
hand, each set his burden in its place,
until the footpath in front of a dozen
houses was lined with an unbroken wall
of stone a yard high. As they worked,
Sam outlined the demands they should
make when asked to work in the water
from the burst pipe—for extra pay, for
rubber boots, for shorter hours—until
he found the rest of the gang more
interested in Bob’s defence of his wager
on Bluetail and in combating the scorn
Bob poured on their racing judgment.
“Do you blokes ever think of any-
thing but horses?” he snarled.
“Sometimes,” said Bob ; “there’s
ponies.”
He eyed the stacked ballast critically,
“Looks too good for our work,” he said ;
and at a touch from his pick here and
there along the heap cascades of stone
shot on to the footpath. “Give the old
girls something to knock their corns on,”
he said.
From time to time the ganger had
paused to watch them, but always from
a distance. They were getting the ballast
fteToment H heeSS
mented on the rock-strewn footpath or
the lack of openings to give access to the
houses, the ballast would probably end
up on somebody’s lawn.
A garbage-man was not so complacent.
“How the hell do you expect me to get
my tins out?” he demanded as he sur-
veyed Bob’s handiwork.
“Don’t see anything wrong with your
hands and feet, said Bob. Want a vvel
nurse? , .
The garbage-man scanned the horizon,
discovered the ganger a quarter-mile oft,
then thought of what could happen to
his unattended cart. Cursing, he went
stumbling on his way.
“Old girl in there wants you,” he said
to Bob when he came from the house of
the woman who had lost the birds! .
Bob was away quite a while, but move-
ments of a window-blind told that he
was on the alert.
He came back grinning sheepishly.
“The old girl took me serious about the
birds,” he said. “She gave me a cup of
tea, and she’s asked me there for dinner
on Sunday” ; and he began kicking the
ballast on the footpath back on to the
heap.
The footpath cleared in front of the
house out of which he had come, Bob
carefully made a wide opening in the
heap of ballast.
“What the blazes” Sam had begun
to say, when Bob bounded away to meet
a furniture-van. A minute’s colloquy
with the driver, and he was superintend-
ing the carriage of a bulky parcel through
the freshly-made opening in the ballast
and over the cleaned footpath.
“See you later,” he called as he fol-
lowed the cortege into the house.
“That looks like a wireless,” said Bill.
“Bet Bob’s butted in to listen to the
races.”
“Wish I had half his luck” came from
the mob.
As they waited for the lunchtime “Yo-
ho! ” Sam gathered his flock. “Don’t be in
a hurry. Pick a thin place, and belt
hard,” he was saying when Bob rushed
out of the house.
“Hi, mates! ” he said excitedly ; “have
your dinner here against the fence. That
was a wireless, and the lady’s going to
put it on the verandah so’s you can listen
to the races. Hi, come and listen to the
races!” he yelled to men going to the
shelter-shed.
Sam laughed. “Going to be a pretty
damp possie when that pipe’s busted.”
“What pipe? Oh, that! To hell with
you and your pipe!” exclaimed Bob.
“Think we’re going to miss the races to
muck about with pipes? Go and chase
yourself! What d’y’ think of him?” he
demanded of the rest of the gang.
Before any could reply, “They’re at the
barrier now! ” came from the house. Ten
picks clattered down ; ten men leapt the
ballast and ran to the fence.
Disgusted, Sam hurled his pick from
him. As he went off to eat his dinner
by himself he heard Bob yell: “Bluetail,
you beaut! Home. with big boots on!
What did I tell y’?”
Candidate’s Manifesto
BY ANGUS O’COHEN.
IN response to numerous pointed hints
from my creditors, and owing to a
tightening-up of the dole regulations,
I have decided to offer myself as a can-
didate at the Federal elections.
My policy? Charity towards all and
malice towards none, at least until after
the poll. On questions of national policy
I shall stand four-square to whatever
wind is blowing. I believe in taking the
long view. Immediate decisions are often
embarrassing.
While I am not in a position at the
moment to do much entertaining, not
having the advantage of a previous term
in Parliament, my prospective constitu-
ents can always be assured of a kind
word, and any recommendations regard-
ing pensions, baby bonuses or Govern-
ment jobs that I can make will be gladly
given.
Regarding the depression, one of my
first moves, if elected, will be a bill to
have it filled in, the work to be made an
unemployed-relief measure at an in-
creased basic wage.
Remember, enough votes for O’Cohen
will take a man off the dole. Vote early
and often.
Porcine Ponderings.
BY S.W.K.
“A pig with eight legs has been born on
a Grafton farm.” —Sydney “Telegraph.”
AS a pig-fancier and experimental
breeder of several years’ experi-
ence, I can give a solemn warn-
ing to this farmer to desist from experi-
ments which, if carried to their natural
conclusion, must inevitably land him, as
they did me, in the murky confines of
the Bankruptcy Court.
Foreseeing a bright economic future
by evolving a pig with eight legs, which
would thus have twice the number of
hams and trotters of the ordinary pig, I
specialised in litters of piglets having
four legs each on the port and starboard
sides.
It would have been a brilliant success,
too, but for the restrictions and quotas
superimposed on a disastrous depression.
With pig-farmers making nothing but
heavy losses on their orthodox-pedalled
pigs, naturally my losses were comraen-
surately greater with my eight-legged
variety. The more I sold the heavier
became my burden.
Still, I find comfort in the fact that, had
my scheme to evolve a 2700-pound pig
by crossing my eight-legged ones with the
American bison fructified, my bankruptcy-
might have been even more serious, and
I would have almost been to the point
of worrying about my creditors. As it
turned out, the scheme fortunately failed
because, on top of acclimatisation diffi-
culties and the bison’s intense dis-
like of spinifex and prickly-pear as a
staple diet, there was nobody on my farm
who chewed gum, crooned or utilised
his nasal organ for speech.
The bisons all died of galloping nos-
talgia.
A Glimpse.
Through my window, northward facing
Over garden, over arbor,
Over laurel-trees and lilacs,
Night and day I glimpse the Harbor.
Night and day entranced I view it,
When there comes no fog to mask it,
As one views a radiant jewel
Bedded in a perfect casket.
Beauty dwells there, wakes there, sleeps there,
Dreams there ever, late and early—
Night and morning, noon and sunset,
With her golden lights and pearly.
There I glimpse at gifted moments,
From the heights whereon I’m dwelling,
Sunset-magic and moon-magic
Past all painting, past all telling.
There, when fade the stars at daylight—
Lonesome stars and stars that cluster—
Dawn from out her well of glory
Draws and pours a roseate lustre.
This I vision, northward facing
Over garden, over arbor,
When compelling Beauty bids me
Gaze upon her home, the Harbor.

“Psalmist of the Dawn,”
By MARY MARLOWE.
There are few settings left in the world
that some novelist or other has not used,
but for this charming romance Miss
Marlowe has found one of them. Her
story, from the bustle and feverishness
of city life, moves quickly to Lord Howe
Island, palm-crested speck in the Pacific
which is a romance in itself. Miss Mar-
lowe knows her islanders intimately:
remote from the world’s hurly-burly;
characteristically ruled over by Three Wise
Men; altogether about the happiest people
on earth. The real and yet almost fairy-
tale island atmosphere gives the novel a
refreshing distinction, a compelling touch
of difference.
“Psalmist of the Dawn,” by Mary Marlowe, is now on sale at
all bookstalls and newsagents. Published by The Endeavour
Press, 252 George Street, Sydney.
An Endeavour Press Book. Price 4j6 (postage 3d.).
