Are you sitting tight...
While everyone's up in armchairs!
Can it be . . . you haven’t heard?
After all, since the very first Armchair flight enthusiasts
have been crusading for the right to stretch. Telling the
world that BOAC really have the most comfortable
economy class seat in the world.
Friends are told about the roomy contours of the seat.
Relations learn about the foamy soft upholstery. Complete
strangers overhear about the stretch-right-out leg room.
Now everyone is up in armchairs. Maybe that’s why the
company is so varied and so much fun on BOAC.
BOAC have 10 Armchair Flights a week out of Australia
to London and Europe. Seven a week West via India. Three
a week East via the U.S.A.
So go along and see your BOAC Travel Agent, BOAC or
Qantas, General Sales Agents for BOAC.
Any time at all, they’ll get you out of a tight spot.
And up in armchairs.

ONE MORE
WEEK
INFORMALITY
THE PRIME MINISTER, Mr. Gorton,
with his shirt unbuttoned to the waist,
has been setting new standards in in-
formality for politicians. In fact, the
decision on how much bare skin they
are going to show is now as serious
for politicians as it is for film actresses.
A photographer, recently in Adelaide,
went first to take the Premier, Don
Dunstan. Mr. Dunstan was in a suit.
However, he generously suggested that
if the photographer came back the next
day he could photograph him in shorts.
The photographer then went on to
take Mr. Andrew Jones, MHR. Mr.
Jones was at his desk in shorts, but, for
the photograph, slipped into a suit
jacket so that he would appear con-
ventionally dressed.
AGREED
HARD on the death of Harold Holt,
we mentioned that the British “New
Statesman” has set a competition, men-
tioning Holt’s drowning and asking for
suggestions on how other world states-
men might die and devising their last
words. We wrote that this seemed in
bad taste.
We have now heard from the British
High Commissioner in Canberra, asking
us to note that the “New Statesman”
has now admitted that at one point it
seemed there might be more protests
about the poor taste of the competition
than there were entries.
WHOSE BEST FRIEND?
THERE’S an international acid test
by which the value of diamonds can
be precisely assessed — relax, all
owners, of course we’re speaking
figuratively — and Australia is simply
not using it. Appraisals here are more
in the nature of estimates based on
the experience of traders in the keen,
wholesale diamond market.
Who dares play such a dim light on
the brilliance of jewellers’ professional
standing? The culprit is Mr. Roy Giles,
of Sydney, back home last week from
the U.S. with a diploma from the
Gemmological Institute of America,
eager to put out his shingle as Aus-
tralia’s first such “qualified diamond
appraiser,” and convinced of the need
for at least a dozen others from Aus-
tralia to undertake a similar study.
There is no need, he says, for
mystique in judging what a diamond
is worth. Yet not long ago a young
solicitor here purchased a diamond for
$240, and, happily believing he was
buying wholesale, received a valuation
from the jeweller of $320. When an
insurance company asked for an in-
dependent valuation, the figure he got
from another reputable source was $l2O,
from yet another $l5O, and still another
$240.
In Australia, Mr. Giles claims, valua-
tions will not stand up in court, because
there is no yardstick. In the U.S., as
a result of the Gem'mological Institute’s
work (assisted by a gift of 1500 carats
of diamonds from De Beers a few years
ago), standards are precise. The
Institute’s scientists go into court and
their expert testimony can win or lose
cases.
After the first gem-cutting work of
a Venetian, Vincenti Peruzzi, in the
17th century, little further progress in
cutting was made for 300 years until
1919, in America, when Marcel Tol-
kowski, more a mathematician than a
gem-cutter, worked out the proper pro-
portion of cut for maximium degree
of brilliance. It is his gospel Mr. Giles
aims to spread.
Tolkowski’s ideal cut remains the in-
ternational basis for evaluating diam-
onds and any deviation from this shape
reduces a stone’s value: for instance,
the table, or top surface, of a diamond
should represent 53 percent of diameter,
no more, no less. If the proportion is
greater you get a swindle —a traditional
term relating to cutting, nothing to do
with what might happen to an unwary
diamond buyer in the East, which, Mr.
Giles says, is the world’s dumping
ground for junk diamonds.
The Gemmological Institute, educa-
tional centre for the diamond industry
in America, and to which famous
centres such as Amsterdam send men
for training, is the only recognised body
which produces a price list directly tied
in with tests of quality to enable valuers
to do an exact job, according to Mr.
Giles.
At his mid-city jewellery story, Mr.
Giles’ easy-going manner (“with per-
missible exaggeration you could say I
was born under a jeweller’s counter”)
comes rather refreshingly after the
Roy Giles...no need for mystique
shock of a floor-to-ceiling-grille door
which arrests customers in the small
lobby until business is stated and a
release catch under the counter allows
admission. In his new venture as a
valuer he expects to work mainly for
insurance companies.
If the opinions of Mr. Giles, a trim,
fit 60-year-old, make some old-estab-
lished jewellers fidget, they could make
some owners of “nest-egg” jewels even
more restive, particularly those who
bought in the belief that “diamonds are
a good investment.”
"They are if you’ve got at least
$50,000,” Mr. Giles said. For what?
“To open your own retail diamond
business. The man in the street who
buys a diamond pays 25 percent sales
tax, plus the retailer’s legitimate profit,
so how can it be an investment for the
buyer? And if he later wants to sell he
is in a forced-sale position, like an
estate which is being sold for probate,
and he should expect something like
a quarter of the retail price. Why
should a jeweller buy back a stone
for more than he need pay in his
regular trading channels just because a
customer has had the loan of it? If
you buy a refrigerator, do you expect
your money back after you have had it
for 12 months?”
Not that Mr. Giles is knocking diam-
onds. He loves ’em. They are an

One look tells you it’s the handsomest
Holden ever built. So let’s get down to the
brawn beneath the beauty.
A barrel-chested new VB. 5 litres big.
210-hp strong. And available on all models.
Bigger, dual-circuit safety brakes tame it.
And there’s a new road-sure ride that stamps
this as the smoothest, most responsive
Holden yet. Not surprising!
Its track is wider. Wheelbase longer.
Suspension huskier. And steering lighter.
A bigger, better, stronger car all round.
And a safer one with a host of
majoi advances including the exclusive
energy-absorbing steering column
and double-sided safety rims on all wheels.
Premier at left shows you the kind of
goodies you’ll find inside. Softer, plumper
seats higher-backed for extra comfort.
A new line-up of rich nylon cloths as well as
luxury Morrokides and easy-care Sadlons.
And for those who prefer them, bucket seats
(reclining if you wish) are available on all models.
Which brings us to big news of a personal
nature. Custom features galore! So many
that you can virtually design your own car
on the showroom floor. 4 engines, 4 ways to
change gear. Air-conditioning. Power
operated windows. And loads more.
Like we say, this Holden isn’t just a
new model. It’s a new generation! Catch up
with it soon at your Holden Dealer.

something peerlessly beautiful. And
there is appreciation of value. Before
1966, when a 1\ percent rise
declared by the Diamond Trading
Company of London, which controls
97 percent of the market, $200 would
buy a diamond of 33 points. Now it
will buy only 29 points.
COSMOPOLITAN CHARACTER
A BRIEF BIOGRAPHICAL run-
down on Roderick Cameron makes
him sound like one of the more cos-
mopolitan characters in a book by his
former neighbor, Somerset Maugham.
The son of an American father and
an Australian mother (who belonged
to the Lindeman wine-producing
family and was acclaimed, as women
no longer are, as “a great beauty”)
. . . educated at a kindergarten in
Paris, an Arab school in Cairo, private
school in England, college in Switzer-
land, and university in Munich, and,
somehow, the first child to be taken
into Tutankhamen’s tomb after it was
opened.
During the war he served with the
Intelligence Service in Washington
. . . wrote for “Life,” then “Horizon,”
and published his first book, “My
Travel’s History,” in 1952 ... an
American citizen who lives in a villa
built in the Palladian style, in the
South of France.
An imposing, even forbidding, list
which makes Cameron’s modesty a
surprise. He is in Australia for four
months doing research for his next
book, a pictorial history of this
country, and he has taken as his head-
quarters a flat in Darling Point.
“The w'ay 1 w’as brought up is not
the way I would choose for my chil-
dren, if I had any. I don’t think
children should be moved around too
much—they begin not knowing what
they are.”
He is still moving around, to a new
country for each book—Africa, the
East, Latin America, Australia. “This
isn’t my first book about Australia.
‘My Travel’s History’ was about the
first visit I’d made here since my
childhood. And I did an account of
Captain Cook’s voyages. In all of
them I’ve tried to give a feeling of
moving backwards and forwards, from
past to present, as I’m going to do in
this one.”
The book will be a type of cultural
history, with more than 300 black-and-
white photographs and illustrations and
20' color plates. “I’m not at all in-
terested in politics, so I didn’t want to
write about this aspect of the country.
I’m interested in the art and the archi-
tecture. I want it to be as visual as
possible.”
Cameron himself is taking the
architectural photographs — he’s visit-
ing every Australian capital — while
Kerry Dundas, a Sydney photographer,
is working on others for--the book.
Cameron is also using some historical
illustrations from the N.S.W. Public
Library.
He spends an average of three years
on a book from conception to com-
pletion, usually choosing a country he
knows nothing about. But in the case
of Australia, of which he knew a good
deal, he re-read the early histories be-
fore making this trip. “When I got
here, I was like a cook who knows the
ingredients he is to use.”
Since Hamish Hamilton published
his first book, each of those he has
done since has been commissioned, be-
ginning the next as he finished the one
before it. In fact, his last book, “Vice-
royalties of the West,” will be published
here in March, before he leaves.
“Writing is agony for me, but being
commissioned for books does give you
impetus to finish them. You don’t have
that awful feeling that perhaps you’re
doing all this for nothing.
“I think I became a waiter merely
through willpower. Somerset Maugham
told me once that you must treat it
as if you’re going to an office that
there is no question of waiting for
inspiration. So that’s what I do. It
has become easier over the years
like a muscle you’ve used often. But
I’ve never done fiction because I can
never convince myself that a story I
think of is real enough.”
And what would he have been if he
hadn’t become a writer?
He smiled. “Quite easily nothing. My
father built one of the first skyscrapers
in New York, so by right I should have
gone in and managed that.”
Despite his American citizenship, he
has spent no longer than six months at
a time in the United States “only
because of circumstances. I could live
there quite easily, I think.” Instead,
he lived in England until the war, then
moved to the South of France.
“My mother bought the property 25
years ago, and I thought, well, why not
live there? So I rebuilt the house which
was there in the Palladian style.” He
took a set of bound photographs from
a small side table. “It looks pompous,
but it isn’t. I’m impressed by modern
architecture, but I couldn’t think of
living in a modern house except if
it were a glass house on a clifftop
somewhere.
“My mother’s in South Africa now,
because of the horse-racing. At 74, she
suddenly decided she was interested in
racing. One of her husbands had a
facing stud. She’s still wonderful-
looking.”
And the childhood visit to Tutank-
hamen’s tomb? He looked amused.
“That happened because Lord Car-
narvon was a friend of my mother’s.
I was eight and, as you can imagine,
was tremendously excited about it. The
footprints of the high priest were still
there in the dust.
“Yes, I still feel close to my family,
although we’re all a long way from one
another. After all, they’re the only
people who don’t question you, who
accept you as you are.”


A green lawn
is the
badge of shame
BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
UNDERSTAND that I am a good Mel-
burnian. For the good of the com-
munity I have stopped drinking water.
I have even made the sacrifice of not
using ice blocks in my scotch. When
I take a shower I stand in a bucket
and use the water on the azaleas. After
having the bath I syphon the water on
to the grapefruit tree. Nor is a drop
ever wasted out of our washing
machine. Immediately it starts to
gurgitate we form a chain gang with
buckets. There are some citizens in
this town who have been urging us
to put a bucket in the lavatory cistern.
They point out that each time the
lavatory is flushed, then the volume
of a brick of water will be saved.
Patriotic and Melburnian to the core
as I am, I have resisted this idea.
Dear reader, since this column last
reported to you on the rigors of the
Melbourne drought the situation has
become far worse. We are now allowed
only to water the garden by bucket.
There is something superbly egalitarian
about bucketing. Even the rich have to
bucket. Indeed they have to bucket
more than the poor because their
gardens are bigger and rhododendrons
more precious.
Indeed, a trip down Albany Road or
Heyington Place, Toorak, during the
evening is a most rewarding experi-
ence, one sees the very nicest of people
from the very best families, bucketing.
One of the society pages the other
night gave health instructions on “how
to bucket.” Some of the nicest backs
have been injured lately from the loads
they have had to carry. Now here’s
the good advice. NEVER carry two
buckets at once. Carry the first load
in your right hand, the second load
in your left. Also, always bend your
knees and lift with a straight back.
Thank you.
Some of the rich still escape. There
are areas like Beaumaris, Brighton, and
such, where it is possible to put down
a bore. Mr. K. G. Putt, in Brighton,
spent $2OOO putting down a bore to
190 ft., plus a 4000-gallon tank and
electric pumps to keep his automatic
sprinkler going. Naturally he was be-
ing dobbed in every five minutes to the’
Board of Works, so he put up a sign:-
“BORE WATER IS BEING USED IN
THIS GARDEN.” From then on the
citizens were knocking on his door
every five minutes asking for infor-
mation on how to put down a bore.
So he took down the sign. It was easier
to get dobbed in to' the Board of
Works.
The Board of Works has a water
patrol. They go round in cream cars
with red signs down the side. The
badge of shame is a green lawn. If you
have one of these you are instantly sus-
pect. Yet most of their information
comes from neighbors, and they get 40
to 50 dobbing-in cases a day. One
gentleman from the water patrol made
this significant remark: “You’ve no idea
how many people telephone to dob their
neighbors in, particularly if it’s a
migrant neighbor.” In the last batch of
dobbers, one neighbor called to say the
housewife next door was filling her
birds’ bath. Another announced that his
neighbor was hiding behind the wisteria
washing his car with the hose.
Oh, yes, we have come to drinking
the Yarra water. A cocktail of one-in-
five has been going into the water sys-
tem. We were terribly hurt when the
Sydney “Daily Telegraph” commented:
“The drought has caused great hardship
in Australia, but Melbourne will make
the supreme sacrifice. They’re going to
drink Yarra water.”
Well, it should be pointed out the
Yarra may be small, it may be an odd
color in its lower reaches, but its water
is not to be spurned. After the
announcement, the Board of Works, in
the presence of the chairman, Mr.
A. H. Croxford, ran a water-tasting. It
took place miles from Yarra Glen,
right at the spot where the Board pumps
it into the metropolitan system. The
general comment was “odorless, color-
less, with a clear, sweet taste.”
Obviously it was a water that would
improve. Stored for five years at 62deg.
in green bottles, here was a water that
would gain great nobility.
Then the ultimate indignity came last
week. It was felt necessary to bring
down a team of Aboriginal rainmakers
from back of Bourke. The visit was spon-
sored by the Plastalon plastic raincoat
company. You must appreciate the
Plastalon people would be greatly
assisted if Aboriginal rainmakers could
do any good right now.
Plastalon flew to Melbourne four men
of the Moorawarri tribe, ■ Jack O’Lan-
tern, Bertie Powell, Shiny Ban, and
Shillin’ Jackson. Robin Quartpot should
have come, too, but he had been paid
last week and gone walkabout. All of
them, except Shillin’ Jackson, 63, were
over 70. They arrived at Essendon with
the news that they had already given
Sydney rain. There it took them only
three days. Although the temperature
was in the nineties, Plastalon had two
models in plastic raincoats, absolutely,
at the ready, so to speak.
Now one would have thought that
the proper place for Jack O’Lantern,
Shiny Ben and Co. to go to work would
have been somewhere close to the
swans in the Botanic Gardens. No, it
was all organised for a lunch-hour per-
formance at Waltons. The locale was
the first floor right beside the lounge
suites, plastic cocktail bars, wardrobes,
prams, and inner-spring mattresses,
plus signs “SATISFACTION GUAR-
ANTEED OR YOUR MONEY
BACK.” Some of us wonder whether
the gods and ancestors who were to
provide the rain, might have been
a little disturbed.
The lights were dimmed, because it
is important to do your rainmaking
stuff at twilight. Our twilight was some-
what hampered by batteries of arc-
lights.
The team, giggling and somewhat
embarrassed, came on in tribal paint,,
plus brand new khaki shorts.
The PR man said, “Yes, I know they
should have been in loincloths, but
here in mixed company, I mean, do
you think . . .”
Jack O’Lantern, banging two boom-
erangs started off with chanting “Yeee-I
Yeee-I, HIKE, HIKE,” and the others,
shaking their shoulders, stamped their
feet around three tribal stones which we
The rainmakers came, but not the rain

There was an artificial fire made out
of red paper.
The guttural rumblings with the
sharp cries reminded one of a wool
auction. “Do you think they’ll work it?”
said one lady. “I didn’t bring my
umbrella.”
Next there was a reception at the
Hotel Australia, where we had all been
invited to eat witchetty grubs with
the Moorawarri tribe. What with the
drought it is practically impossible to
get witchetty grubs, so we were served
with fried Mexican tinned worms
bought at Myers. Bertie Powell was.
offered one. He looked at it sadly and
crumbled the over-dried thing in his
fingers.
When asked what was the delay
factor in rainmaking, Jack O’Lantern
said it could be as long as three weeks.
There was no rain that day, and the
next day the temperature in Melbourne
was 110, the hottest since 1939. So the
rainmakers were not immediately suc-
cessful, but one felt at least they were
doing as well as the rainmaking air-
craft which have been operating over
the catchment area since last November.

Hot enough to
make a girl's
eyelashes slip
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
ALL RIGHT, girls, it’s hot. One pair
only of false lashes today or they’ll slip.
No, model June Massey’s not gonna
wear tights. Model June Massey can
hardly breathe to put her eyeliner on,
for the simple reason that Mrs. George
Falkiner’s dining-room window appears
to be irrevocably stuck. Mrs. George
Falkiner’s other window has before it a
table covered with hats and scarves and
shoes, and her sideboard is littered with
jools, the costume variety, and where
her dining-table normally rests and
now pressing heavily into her carpet are
chromium-plated racks of thick winter
clothes; that is, the new collection of
Henriette Lamotte’s Boutique Couture.
Madame Lamotte, otherwise Jani to her
close customers and friends, otherwise
the Countess D’Espinay to people who
care for titles.
Mrs. Falkiner has kindly lent her
Bellevue Hill home for this charity
occasion, which is in aid of the Royal
Blind Society of New South Wales, her
first fashion show ever, she says with
some feeling, and while 300 of Sydney’s
footloose social set pour into her
drawing-room, sometimes referred to as
the ballroom, her sitting-room, her
passageways and out on to her veranda,
waiting for the show to begin, model
June Massey, who allows no one but
Gloria to dress her, is dispensing advice
of a more immediate nature to her four
model colleagues “. . . yeah, they’re
marvellous, one-dollar lashes from Big
‘W’ or Coles, they’re marvellous. I just
tell the boy go and get some more
lashes—you should see his face —well,
at a dollar you can.”
That’s marvellous, June, the girls
breathe. They’ve been paying $6 and
some of them have actually fallen
apart and left hideous gaps. You can’t
have that happening with lashes “. . .
and if you’re going to a party what you
wanna do is press ice on your make-up,
clonk, clonk all over your face, and it
stays put. Really put. What? Well, if
your nose goes, Dari, that’s it. You’ve
had it. Say, hasn’t yours been bobbed?
Best of all, keep your foundation in the
fridge, it comes out set.” June knows
a thing or two about make-up. Revlon
gave her a ton the other day, and, just
her luck, all the wrong colors, but June
happens to be in with all the girls in
Sydney cosmetic shops, so she went
round changing it. One actually gave
her a discount. A discount. True! So
she got some deodorant absolutely free.
Up goes an arm and on goes instant
freshness.
In Mrs. Falkiner’s ballroom every-
one’s bringing out fans. “I think a
southerly’s coming up oh, it’s you,
darling,” and at this moment the hand-
made draught seems almost as good as
air-conditioning. Everyone at this stage
feels like admiring Mrs. Falkiner’s
decor, the hibiscus on the catwalk, and
there’s a story: should they be yellow
on the stairs or red, you know, match
them or not? argued the slaving
charity workers all morning round
Madame Lamotte, up to her eyes there
with important things to get done. And
that small fracas over the microphone:
Nola Dekyvere wanted it one place,
someone else another. Well, Nola lost,
and it stays right where it is now, in
Mrs. Falkiner’s connecting doorway.
A girl comes round selling 50-cent
raffle tickets, first prize a Lamotte hat,
second prize three bots. whisky. It's
getting fearfully hot. Handkerchiefs dab
delicately. Someone’s come in a swim-
suit under her dress. Someone else is
wearing whit could be a swimsuit over
her dress. Beth Churchill, a regular
social-page name, arrives weighed down
with giant acrylic earrings and ring.
Well, she’s got the agency for them in
Australia and d’you know she sold
three dozen in the surf that morning at
Bondi. A girl actually had $2O in her
purse. On the beach, for heaven’s sake.
A dog appears and is quickly
dispatched. Nola rises and says into the
mike “. . . we must thank Madame Le
Bas, our guest-of-honor, for coming
today. She is the wife of the new
Consul-General for France, where they
were so very popular, and I know we
shall love having them here.” A second
dog enters. He is asked to leave. Car-
lotta, Madame Lamotte’s Pekingese, was
coming, but the heat proved too much.
Ted, the AWA man who often brings
his wife to social occasions but could
hardly, he says, to this one. Ted turns
on his tapes, produces Victor Sylvester
. . . and on comes model June Massey
in her single lashes, sans tights, and
dressed beautifully by Gloria in navy-
blue culottes. For an hour she and her
cohorts posture in various thick dresses
and coats. “I must say,” says Nola, “the
flowers are bearing up.” But then, Nola
can get away with things like that.
She actually, when everyone’s gasping
for champagne, they can see the stuff
there at the door, Nola actually says,
raising a commanding hand, “Ladies,
please stay in your seats while I draw
the raffle and say thank you to every-
one, including Mrs. Les Hooker, who
donated the chairs, and they are cer-
tainly very comfortable chairs . . .”
Incidentally, where did the thigh-high
black leather boots come from?
Madame Lamotte doesn’t know. All that
Eva, the model who wore them, knows
is without suspenders they damn’d well
fall down.

\i>u may never quite get used to
those second glances that come your way
You didn't notice them, not at first; you were too absorbed
with piloting your new Datsun 2000 from the moment
you drove it out of the showroom, with just the hint of
perspiration on your palms, wondering if you shouldn't
have done a brief conversion course after driving that
everyone-has-one machine for so long.
Then after you'd panicked at the traffic lights, and dived
forthe ignition key when you gotthe green and found that
the engine was running, but so quietly; and when your
familiarity with all the knobs and switches controlling the
comfort and safety features had given you that quiet glow
of proud ownership, then you became relaxed and
conscious of those double takes from others on the road
and from behind curtains on your own street.
There was that fellow' in the long American job at the
intersection, who sidled alongside and looked so long
that he nearly forgot to make his challenge; thatgirl in the
big round sun glasses in the open sports car who didn't
even notice who was driving the Datsun —that's what
you've got to expect now; those second glances of which
you may never grow tired.

Vietnam: when is
defeat a victory?
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER"
IT DOES NOT MAKE things any
better in the Vietnam War to get
hysterical about it —especially since
the war may now be in a stage when
things are decided. One can at least
recognise at a time such as the Viet
Cong attacks on Saigon and other
cities that although there may be
mysteries in particular engagements,
and although there are special un-
familiarities and difficulties in talking
about the Vietnam War generally,
there is nevertheless a whole body of
general knowledge about warfare from
which one can still derive a certain
amount of relevant commonsense.
For example, the mere fact that an
enemy attacks is not in itself an
occasion for panic. This is what
enemies are supposed to do. In par-
ticular it should be remembered that
it is a commonplace of war that the
enemy looks for a weakness and tries
to launch overwhelming strength
against it. Under these circumstances,
if he has made the right decision, he
might advance. But if his troops are
then slaughtered to a man, he may
have suffered defeat, not victory. For
example, the Viet Cong made a cor-
rect appraisal of the strength of the
guard on the grounds of the American
Embassy in Saigon. They applied
strength, and seized the grounds. Then
they were all killed.
It is misleading to think of Saigon
as a “guarded city.” Saigon is a city
in which a strong deployable force is
available, but it is not ringed with
troops in a battle line that has to be
forced. It can be “penetrated” by a
small party on a bus ride. But if
Viet Cong units attack as openly as
they did last week a force can be
quickly deployed against them that
can trap them and kill them. This is
what American and allied “control”
of Saigon and other cities means. It
means that Viet Cong forces can seize
a building, or a district, and then they
are all killed. If they continued to
follow a policy of raids on Saigon and
other cities the most likely result would
be that they would all get killed. The
war would then be over. In the same
way, if the Viet Cong and North
Vietnamese units outside the cities
massed against even inferior forces of
Americans so that America’s terrify-
ing firepower could be concentrated
on human targets, they would be
slaughtered. Most of American fire-
power now explodes on earth and trees.
If the Viet Cong make themselves con-
spicuously available, it will explode on
them.
Why then has General Giap taken
such bloodthirsty risks in attacking so
many strong points in Vietnam at
once? If there is nothing more to his
strategy than this, if he intends to
continue to send his troops to almost
certain death, he is just as likely to
lose as to create that psychological
victory that may be the decisive factor.
Of course it is possible that if, when
the present attacks are defeated, they
are followed by later attacks, con-
fidence could be so shattered, in
America as in Vietnam, that, despite
the death of so many Viet Cong and
North Vietnamese soldiers, Giap would
win; but it is also possible that if he
did turn all the communist forces in
South Vietnam into a suicide army his
army might fall to pieces. There is also
“psychological victory” for the defender
if he continues to defeat an attacker.
It seems hard to imagine that Giap
intends to take this risk. He would
know that it would serve his cause if
the populations of South Vietnamese
cities were thoroughly demoralised by
continuing attacks. But he would also
know that a state of continuing attacks
would be one that would be settled by
armies not by the morale of city
dwellers and that the morale of his
own army could be destroyed by con-
tinuing and certain defeats. Even if the
present attacks are not followed up
there is no doubt that they have shaken
confidence in the Americans and in the
Thieu Government; but they must also
begin to shake the confidence of Giap’s
own forces.
What next? Probably an attempt
to turn Khe Sanh into a Dien Bien
Phu. The attacks on the cities are prob-
ably a diversion, to be followed up by
new battles in the north that may be
decisive. If these battles begin we should
not assume that the Americans will lose.
The Americans are not the French.
They have air fleets unimaginable to
the French; much better weapons; much
better defences; much better morale.
And even if the Americans lost Khe
Sanh they would not be militarily
defeated. But there is no doubt that this
would be a psychological defeat of
immense but unpredictable effect on
American public opinion.
It is for this reason that we may
be reaching a decisive stage in the war,
about which one can make no confi-
dent predictions whatever. Is Giap go-
ing for complete victory (and thereby
risking complete defeat)? Or is he
punching away at his enemies’ morale,
hoping for truce talks and a settlement
that will give his side the advantage?
We don’t know. But we do know that
Giap once said: “Every minute hun-
dreds of thousands of people are dying
all over the world. The life or death of
a hundred, a thousand, or of tens of
thousands of human beings, even if
they are our own compatriots, really
represents very little.”

The Viet Cong;
a drive
of despair?
LAST WEEK the Australian news
media were full of the Viet Cong kami-
kaze attacks on the U.S. Embassy and
many other city installations. Rarely
have the media provided such an
inaccurate version of what happened.
The laughs were in the simple mis-
takes. The Melbourne “Herald” had a
picture of Diem’s presidential palace,
demolished after the 1964 coup, and,-
presented this as the building which
some VC peppered with sniper fire and
the odd mortar bomb. The “Age’s”
John Bennets from Singapore gave an
excellent description of the old U.S.
Embassy which had been “assaulted,”
but unfortunately for him he described
the wrong building. It has since shifted,
and it was a quite different new'buikk
ing which was, in fact, attacked.
The Sydney Afternoons reported U.S,
Embassy seized, when a small squad of
suicides only managed to get into the
grounds. The ABC had a Prime Minis-
ter Thieu declaring martial law and a
United Nations Command sending in
tanks. The “Canberra Times” had
North Korean troops massing near
Khe Sanh. Most maps of Saigon had
Tan Son Nhut well out of place, one
paper having it on the road to Bien
Hoa. N
Superficial mistakes of course, but
these are symptomatic of the partial
ignorance of Vietnam of many of the
people who process our news. More
important was the ’silly and inaccurate
reaction of the leader-writers in major
papers to the attack oh the American
Embassy. ;
Most seemed to start writing from
the assumption that the target attacked
had been heavily defended in some
way, making the attacks particularly dif-
ficult. Anyone who goes to Vietnam
quickly notices how little static defence
there is. Major hotel billets are
guarded by a single sleepy marine or
MP with a few sandbags or an oil-
drum around him and his rifle stuck
against a wall, the U.S. Embassy has
two or three men guarding it, the
Vietnamese Army headquarters has two
soldiers in a bunker at the entrance,
province capitals usually have a few
strands of barbed wire around the
province chief’s compound and, at
most, a platoon of troops. Risky of
course, but the real war has been one
of mobility out in the paddies and
jungles.
In these circumstances it is premature
to say as the “Age” did that the attacks
were a “spectacular feat of arms*” or
as the “Sydney Morning Herald” put
it, that the “military initiative is firmly 1
in the Hands of Communists” and that
Westmoreland had been “outgeneralled”
by Giap.

-captured out of the Communists’ main
force strength of about 125,000. This
is not a victory, unless it produces
other results, and that remains to be
.seen.
Not a single significant U.S. or Viet-
namese official, leader or military man
hurt, no serious damage to any in-
stallation attacked (except the radio
station). Massive “Pentagon East,” the
very flammable wooden office complex
at Tan Son Nhut, from which most
of the allied effort is planned and
directed, is left untouched. Nothing
whatever seized and held. More than
five percent of the Communist troop
strength lost in several days of bloody
slaughter.
There is no more local victory in
losing 15,000 troops for 1200 allied
soldiers and a few dozen machines than
there was a “victory” in the 8 to 1
against slaughters at Dak To and Loc
Ninh. And the introduction of war-
fare into the streets of cities will no
more endear the Viet Cong to the Viet-
namese people than the flame-thrower
massacre of women and children at
Dak Son.
It is the virtually unanimous view of
Vietnam war analysts that the Com-
munists in October last made a major
strategic about-face. Critical man-
power, morale, and logistics problems
(as described by Hanson Baldwin for
example) made them abandon “pro-
tracted warfare up to 20 years” as
the guiding doctrinal theme of the
struggle. That went right overboard
and was replaced with phrases like “All-
out offensive,” “The sprint phase of the
revolution,” and “General uprising.”
A crisis in the Communist military
effort caused them to abandon attri-
tion as a strategy and go for broke
to strengthen their bargaining position
before switching the struggle to the
conference room.
The Communists hoped through a
last desperate drive on centres of
administration to weaken American con-
fidence in the allied military position
and give a little more substance to their
claims of de facto control over areas
of the country. Thanks to the allied
military efforts over the past 18 months,
the Communists now look more likely
than ever to shift their energies into the
political and diplomatic area and to
agree to talks and a truce.
If a “political settlement” is to be
more than a semantic dress-up for a
withdrawal which allows the Com-
munists to ride along their “coalition
route to power” then we will have to
fight a protracted international
“psychological war.”

AUSTRALIA
Mr. Hasluck goes off,
holding tight to his options
WHEN EXTERNAL AFFAIRS Min-
ister Hasluck went off on Friday to
Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, and Dja-
karta he took with him not only the
Secretary of the External Affairs De-
partment, Sir James Plimsoll, and the
Deputy - Secretary of the Defence
Department, Mr. G. E. Blakers.
He also took with him what could be
the beginning of Australia’s first inde-
pendent strategic policy, carried out
with a major ally, forced on Australia
by the British withdrawal.
Mr. Hasluck is telling the Foreign
Ministers of Malaysia, Singapore, and
Indonesia that Australia is prepared
to continue its limited troop commit-
ments to Malaysia-Singapore and that
it would like them to be there under
a loosely worded agreement which is
seen as an adaptation of the existing
arrangements. Mr Hasluck may not
say so, but it is believed that the Aus-
tralian Government can probably be
pushed into some modest expansions of
military strength in Malaysia-Singapore.
Mr. Hasluck may also offer a modest
training team of military advisers and
instructors. He may also discuss the
possibility of offering defence equip-
ment on easy terms.
What seems certain is that Australian
defence planners are keen to make a
go of the joint air-defence system.
They want the British to train local
technicians to take over the early-
warning and ground-to-air missile sys-
tems, and they will offer to maintain
a Mirage interceptor presence. At
present there are two Australian squad-
rons at Butterworth. The Australian
Government might be induced to put
a third at Singapore, especially if Sin-
gapore and Malaysia were to decide to
contribute to the system by themselves
acquiring some Mirages or their equiv-
alent.
However, the Australian Government
is trying to maintain a public attitude
of cool toward invitations from Mal-
aysia’s Tunku Abdul Rahman and
Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew for Aus-
tralia to move into parts of the
British vacuum. This comes both from
a hesitance about taking on new
burdens and from a desire to demon-
strate that Australia does, not want to
butt in as the heir of a departing
colonial power.
Part calculation, part rationalisa-
tion for indecisiveness, the argument
proceeds that it does Malaysia and
Singapore no harm to sweat a little,
and for the fact to sink in deeply that
they have to live without a great power
as ultimate guarantor.
One of the causes of the present
misunderstandings between Australia
and Singapore comes from the different
time perspectives of the Australian and
Singaporean leaders. The Australian
Government thinks in terms of the next
three or four years, Lee Kuan Yew
and his Cabinet are worrying right
through the 19705. Canberra men see
a continuation of an Australian pre-
sence in the area in terms of provid-
ing “something just more than a token
force” so that they can demonstrate
continuing Australian interest. Accord-
ing to their policy the force would be
there:
• Because the local Governments want
it there for the continuity of military
capability it gives.
• Because it lessens the degree of
isolation felt by the Americans in
Vietnam, with pressures for a Western
withdrawal from Asia.
• Because it gives Australia a base
from which Australia’s presence could
be expanded should other develop-
ments demand it.
While Australia’s policy is an
option-holding one, in Singapore and
probably in Kuala Lumpur, too, the
Governments think of possible specific
threats. Could Suharto be overthrown?
Would Indonesia regress to chauvinism?
Or split into rival islands? Is Maoist
insurgency likely? What would happen
to Singapore if Malaysia went extreme?
What would happen to Malaysia if
Singapore went extreme?
Australian strategic planners seem
more prepared to dismiss these as sheer
speculation rather than treat them as
contingencies which have to be pro-
vided for. So far as immediate insur-
gency is concerned, they believe this
has to be tackled principally by the
governments concerned, and that on
their present scale there is no doubt
that this is possible. Malaysia’s 15-bat-
talion army should be able to deal with
the thousand or so insurgents in the
North Borneo territories and the similar
number along the Thai border, as long
as Indonesia and Thailand remain as
they now are.
It is because it wants to hold tight
to its options that Australia is most un-
likely to agree to any tightly worded
treaty. Too tight a wording might limit
Australian flexibility. This would be
important in deciding, for example,
whether or not to assist in countering
an insurgency of a kind that was mainly
or wholly inter-racial. But even modest
option-holding will make extra military
demands. At present the Australian
Army has an infantry battalion and an
artillery battery in Malaysia. New Zea-
land has an under-strength battalion.
To maintain these, once British support
elements are withdrawn, about 1000
extra Australians might have to go to
Malaysia. And the Australian Govern-
ment might possibly undertake with
the New Zealanders to gradually build
the present one-and-a-half battalion
Hasluck and advisers...a public attitude of cool toward invitations from the Tunku
(Left, Sir James Plimsoll: right, Defence Deputy-Secretary Blakers)


force up to a three-battalion-strong
brigade.
But, if the option of doing something
(contrasted with the option of not doing
something) is going to work, this
increase in force would not be enough.
It might be a big enough force to hold
in the area, but to be credible there
would have to be more like it back
home. The crucial strategic issue re-
mains the extent to which Australia is
prepared to give its “just more than
token force commitment” real meaning
by developing the capacity to reinforce
in strength and with speed should the
situation demand. Three battalions
could easily be stationed in peacetime
Malaysia right now, but since we have
only an eight-battalion army this would
provide no base from which to rein-
force. This puts the Government back
to its basic problem of how far the
Army has to be expanded. The betting
at this stage (taking Mr. Gorton’s
statement last week to refer only to
Vietnam) is that the next three-year
program will see an unspectacular ex-
pansion from eight battalions to 11 or
12. Does this provide an option?
The RSL
Challenging an old British tradition
IS PRIME MINISTER GORTON, as
his supporters claim, a man who has
no time for the stuffy sentimentality
and traditionalism of former Australian
leaders? The RSL is going to put him
to the test soon. They are about to
demand a full inquiry into military
service decorations. Last October’s
RSL national congress threw up wide-
spread and almost unanimous criticism
of the procedures and rules governing
the award of medals for gallantry. And
anyone who talks to our soldiers in
Vietnam at the ACMP at Nui Dat will
find such sentiment reproduced with
great fervor among our present fighting
men . . . “It’s a bloody' farce,” they’ll
say.
The discontent revolves around three
issues:
• The cumbersome procedure of refer-
ring recommendations to a British com-
mittee in London, whence they are
leisurely passed on to Buckingham
Palace for approval, delaying the issue
of awards up to 12 months.
• Non - recognition of non - British
awards, which requires Australians who
have fought in Allied units as instruc-
tors or as comrades in joint actions to
refuse to accept awards granted by
Allied governments.
• The limited number of awards which
can be granted posthumously.
RSL national secretary Bill Keys is
fighting mad on the subject: “The sys-
tem is utterly archaic and in need of
urgent review.” He is even more deter-
mined that the RSL case should be
properly considered after receiving two
quite inane letters from the Govern-
ment in reply to RSL representations.
A letter with the signature of
Defence Minister Fairhall on it (though
to be fair to him, obviously drafted by
a departmental Colonel Blimp) read
as follows: “I do not share your view
that the war in Vietnam proves the
need for revision of the awards system.
The Australia forces fighting in Viet-
nam are fighting in the Queen’s Ser-
vice, and whether British Forces or
other Commonwealth Forces are simi-
larly engaged has no bearing whatever
on this fact. Her Majesty is the Queen
of Australia ... the rules are sound
and consistent, and have been so proven
over many years. The reasons behind
the limited conditions for the accep-
tance and wearing of foreign decora-
tions is that our servicemen are wear-
ing the Queen’s Uniform and are fight-
ing in the defence of Her Realm, it
is Her Perogative (sic) alone to grant
honors in recognition of gallantry in
Her Service . . .”
Australian troops in Vietnam say
that this rule of refusing non-British
decorations is a major cause of friction
with the Americans and the Vietnam-
ese, and it is a source of disappoint-
ment for Australians themselves, who
hold in high regard a number of Viet-
namese and U.S. awards, and would
be proud to wear them.
The RSL wants final approval of
awards to be made by the Australian
Governor-General. “He’s good enough
to appoint an Australian Prime Minis-
ter and swear in the Australian minis-
try. And he’s been shot at more than
the Queen,” said Keys. “What on
earth could a British Medals Board
possibly add to the consideration of
an award for an act of gallantry in
Keys ... a great anti-climax
Vietnam? Commonsense tells us that
in the years ahead we are unlikely to
be fighting beside the British. Times
have changed, commitments have
changed, and procedures should change.
The system of considering awards
must be streamlined too, to make it
more speedy and eliminate the un-
necessary delay in referring them to
London. By the time awards for Viet-
nam are announced the soldier in-
volved is usually long back in Aus-
tralia, and deployed in a relatively
peacetime capacity. It seems more like
a good behavior award. The action in
which gallantry was displayed, com-
rades saved or whatever, is often for-
gotten. It is all a great anti-climax,
when it should be an immediate
morale-boosting emotional occasion.”
The limited scope for granting post-
humous awards is also a sore point
with the RSL. The DSO, the Military
Cross, the Distinguished Conduct
Medal, and the Military Medal can-
not be granted if the soldier dies, for
some unknown traditional reason. On
the other hand the Victoria Cross, the
Queens Commendation, and Mention
in Dispatches can be granted post-
humously.
The RSL wrote to Mr. Harold Holt
last year on this subject and received
a reply signed “Secretary, E. J. Bunt-
ing” in these terms: “Consideration
has been given at various times to
proposals for widening the scope of
posthumous awards . . . The system
of gallantry awards has been built
up over a very long period dur-
ing which the most careful attention
has been paid to maintaining
uniformly high standards. This has
greatly enhanced the esteem on which
awards are held. The rules to which
we subscribe limit the grant of post-
humous awards to the VC, GC, MID,
and QC which are available to all
ranks. The Statutes of the Orders of
Chivalry state that only living persons
can be appointed to an Order, the DSO
and the OBE are therefore ruled out
as posthumous awards unless the
Statutes were amended. But if they
were amended certain ranks of officers
would still be excluded from awards,
because the DSO is not usually re-
served for officers below the rank of
Major or the equivalent . . .”
Obviously there is plenty of stuffi-
ness and traditionalist thought left for
Prime Minister Gorton to disperse, and
confirmation of the RSL’s attitude to
Australian service decorations would
seem a very good point to begin this
exercise.
Task Force , Vietnam
An old foe
THE EXPANSION of the Australian
Task Force in Vietnam to three full
battalions has greatly increased its
flexibility, and this was reflected in last


week’s Operation Coburg which took
most of the force right out of Phuoc
Tuy province, its “tactical area of
responsibility.” Leaving a battalion at
home to defend the base or provide
relief for Vietnamese outposts attacked
within the TAOR, a two-battalion
force was lifted 40 miles north-east to
the Song Dong rubber plantation on the
outskirts of the great U.S. base at
Bien Hoa. The Americans had detected
at least a battalion of reinforced Viet
Cong moving from their deep VC base
in Zone D near the Cambodian border
toward Bien Hoa, and wanted rein-
forcement. This was given.
It was no radical change in policy,
for Australian troops have always been
available for deployment anywhere in
the 3rd Corps region (which roughly
encompasses a 60-mile radius around
Saigon). But earlier, without the
ability to put out a two-battalion force,
able to cope with about an enemy regi-
ment, and the ability to leave a
battalion back home, Australian troops
were not able to range widely.
The Viet Cong have also played
their part in enabling Australian troops
to be used over a wider area. One of
the two VC regiments which, since
their formation in 1964, have roamed
Phuoc Tuy, was withdrawn before
Christmas to Zone D for recuperation
after a series of beatings at the hands
of Australian troops. That was the 275
Regiment.
But in moving north in Operation
Coburg the Australians seem to have
found their old foe again. For it
was elements of 275 that they en-
countered at Bien Hoa, and in a set
of scattered clashes they killed another
two dozen Viet Cong and made heavy
hauls in arms, ammunition, food, medi-
cal supplies, and documents.
Immigration
Sponsoring Choi
ENTHUSIASM FOR expanding Asian
immigration to Australia grows steadily.
"We reported last week the surprisingly
favorable reaction of the delegates to
the usually staid Citizenship Convention
In Canberra. That was followed by
a strong statement by the powerful
Associated Chambers of Commerce.
The Chamber described Asia as “a vir-
tually unexplored source” of immi-
grants and said: “If shortages exist for
people with particular skills, then it is
in Australia’s interests to fill these
positions with suitable non-European
immigrants.
“There are many reasons why a pro-
gram of stepping up Asian immigration
is timely. With living standards rising
in Europe the task of attracting new
settlers from traditional source coun-
tries is becoming increasingly difficult
. . . Australians in many walks of life
are having much greater individual con-
tact with Asian people. Australian
engineers, doctors, teachers, and tech-
nicians are working with Asians in a
multitude of aid projects in the various
countries of the region. And with in-
creased trade and the establishment of
joint ventures. Australian businessmen
also are experiencing closer contact and
co-operation with many Asian counter-
parts. In this way, prejudices which
may have existed in the past are
steadily being broken down . . . there
is certainly scope for increasing the
rate of acceptance.”
Only last weekend there was another
indication of the same trend with the
announcement by the “veterans of
South-East Asia” that they were spon-
soring a Korean immigrant and his
family. The association of servicemen
from Korea, the Malayan emergency,
and the Confrontation and Viet-
nam campaigns intends this as a test
case, with further sponsorships of Asian
immigrants in the future.
The first sponsored immigrant, Choi
Yung Kil, was befriended as a refugee
boy of 16 by members of the 3rd
Battalion in Korea. He became in-
formally attached to the regimental aid
post and moved with the Battalion
wherever it went, acting as an inter-
preter, procurer of short material, go-
between with villagers, mechanical
wizard, and battalion mascot. At war’s
end the Battalion members raised
money to put him through his final
years of high school. He succeeded and
won a scholarship to university where
he got an economics degree. For some
years now he has been an economist
with the Korean Steelmakers Associa-
tion. At 34 he has a wife and family,
and his 3rd Battalion comrades are
looking forward to having him in Aus-
tralia for a reunion. They will help
him find a job and a house.
State elections
The exceptional year in State politics?
AUSTRALIAN STATE PREMIERS
rarely have to consider the possible
effects of world events in setting dates
for their elections, and usually can
ignore most national issues in favor of
bread-and-butter ones prominent with-
in their own States. But with polls
coming up in New South Wales on
February 24, in South Australia on
March 2, and Western Australia on
March 23, this might be the exceptional
year in State politics. And last week
the ALP’s Federal Leader Whitlam,
just returned from a thorough-going
tour of 10 Asian countries, made a
point of saying he would campaign
vigorously for all three elections.
In New South Wales, Liberal Premier
Askin is able to claim much for his
Party’s first term in office after seem-
ingly endless years of Labor administra-
tion. If State issues alone govern the
election he should be able to win an-
other term on a “give us time to finish
the job” basis alone. He has not
attempted to impose any severe State
taxation, but can still claim visible
movement in many areas, without any
Askin . . . first-term progress
Dunstan . . . developing industry
single “spectacular.” His Government
has done reasonably well in provisions
for education, but this appears to be the
basic issue on which he is being attacked
most strongly and the one for which
he will depend most on goodwill.
This Friday he will give his policy
speech on television, after sending his
coalition partner, Country Party Leader
Cutler on ahead, last week. Mr. Cut-
ler spoke to his State-wide audience
from an ambience of rural-progress
pictures on which were imposed, from
time to time, words such as “Ten
Times Faster,” and “Three Year
Guarantee.” His most memorable tele-
vision speech phrases had to do with
N.S.W.’s topsoil being allowed (some-
how, by Labor) to be blown to New
Zealand where it was used to grow
prime strawberries. Fortunately, Cut-
ler’s speech was better treated by the
Press, which clarified his many points
and offerings.
This year, television is to be widely


used by the Parties in State elections
for the first time and this alone will
give a fillip to electioneering. It might
be the background reason for a “Com-
mittee for Dunstan” which is seeking
public funds in South Australia. In
that State, Labor’s win at the last
election from a Tong-entrenched Liberal
Country League, gives it a “give us
time” advantage, too. The LCL leader
who stepped into Sir Thomas Playford’s
shoes, Mr. Steele Hall, has not become
as well-known as Premier Dunstan, but
television appearances could even that
up by March 2.
Both major Parties in S.A. are
presenting a scattering of young,
new candidates and the Opposition's
already have the campaign support of
young Liberal Federal Member Andrew
Jones, who has lately added appear-
ances on a radio “open line” program
to his many activities. The Opposition
plans to attack Premier Dunstan on an
alleged “failure to develop and foster
industrial growth,” and Sir Thomas
Playford struck the first blow last week
with two articles on these lines in the
Adelaide “Advertiser.” Dunstan, who
is proud of his plans for developing
industry and State services, is expected
to reply vigorously on television.
The furthest election is Western
Australia’s, and by March 23 outside
events may have faded in significance.
The coalition Premier, Liberal David
Brand, is confident of being returned
on his Government’s developmental
record alone and sees little for Labor
Opposition Leader Tonkin to campaign
on. The only flicker of coalition trouble
so far, in a State where the Liberals
and Country Party are sometimes un-
easy partners, has been the switching
of a former Liberal to the CP after
missing pre-selection.
Gough Whitlam
Floodlit hour
EVIDENTLY HAVING READ and
noted the advice against making
decisions or policy statements at the
end of long flights, a wary Mr. Gough
Whitlam would say nothing on arrival
at .Sydney airport last Thursday.
Instead, he nominated 3.30 p.m. Friday
for a Press conference too late for
the afternoon papers but in good time
for extensive TV coverage and the Sat-
urday morning dailies. Then, in the
presence of much of Labor’s top brass,
a dozen or so newspaper reporters, and
television and radio men with prolifer-
ating equipment, he spent an hour on
impressions and opinions gathered in
10 Asian countries before asking for
questions. There were remarkably few.
Some of it Mr. Whitlam had said
three days before on television in Singa-
Opposition Leader Whitlam . . . no Allied defeat in Vietnam
pore, when his questioners had included
American, British, and Russian cor-
respondents. His main criticism of the
American effort in Vietnam was that
only a tenth of its spending went to
support the public servants and soldiers
of South Vietnam, who remained poor
and unable to provide a base for stop-
ping the country’s general corruption.
If only a portion of the money spent on
bombing the North was diverted to
such sectors it would be possible to
have proper development and adminis-
tration in South Vietnam.
While he felt that recent Communist
frontal assaults would not lead to an
Allied defeat in Vietnam, they had
shown that South Vietnam desperately
needed assistance to bring about security
and honesty. It had become urgent for
Australia to use its undoubted influence
to persuade America to change the
whole method on which the war was
being fought, to one of clear and hold
and build, similar to the Australians’
approach in Phuoc Tuy.
In a run through the countries he
had visited, Mr. Whitlam first men-
tioned Japan in the Malaysian con-
text, as helping Malaysia in economic
and trade affairs, including shipping
matters in which Malaysia was look-
ing for help, through regional arrange-
ments as much as she was looking for
possible military help. Later, he ex-
panded on the Japanese role as a future
partner for Australia in elevating the
whole region, and the South-West
Pacific, if Australia would contribute
comparably, at least on a pro-rata basis.
Japan placed much emphasis on the
UN, and wanted to live in competition,
not in conflict.
On her side of the Pacific, said
Whitlam, Australia was ignoring the
effects of the British vacuum on the
South Pacific Commission areas, was
reluctant to enlarge the Commission’s
role, and had refused a call for assis-
tance from Fiji. Another Australian
neighbor, whose future was basic to
Australia’s, was Indonesia receiving
more than $lOO million in aid from
both America and Japan this year, and
a grant of $5.8 million from Australia,
with nothing more until the next
Budget came into effect in October.
“Indonesia is as much our respon-
sibility as anyone’s. We should at least
double last year’s amount. Money spent
on Indonesia is a good investment. It
can be done and should be done.” A
few words in praise of ASEAN as
against an ASPAC, which did not in-
clude Indonesia, and the Opposition
Leader had spent his hour.
The only trouble, perhaps, was that
elsewhere at the same time the Prime
Minister was tugging the rug from
under Mr. Whitlam’s feet by making
his own headline-worthy statement
about Australia’s commitment to Viet-
nam that it would not be increased,
“now or in the future.”
Aircraft industry
Crossroads
THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT indus-
try of Australia, now running at close
to peak peacetime output with the
concurrent Mirage and Macchi pro-
grams, is heading for another cross-
roads. Later this year the Mirage order
will peter out and with no future orders
in sight the industry seems bound to
begin another costly and injurious run-
down. Some defence planners believe
the opposite should be happening, that
Australia should already be working
toward its own strong aircraft industry
which would enable it to plan, design,
and produce its own service aircraft
and in the long run no longer be depen-
dent on other nations for planes, spares,
or armament.
Probably this was an advance many
expected to follow Australia’s initial
capacity to build aircraft such as the
Mirage under licence, but so far there
is no sign of Government thought along

that line. Or even of a first step
onward, one which would require Aus-
tralia’s air arms either to be amal-
gamated or their needs drastically
rationalised so that the number of dif-
ferent aircraft types now in use could
'be cut to an absolute minimum and the
numbers of types finally settled on
raised to a sufficient level to warrant
complete local production, including
weapons and spares.
In all, four basic types of aircraft
could, in future years, be adapted to
meet most of Australia’s service needs,
creating a very effective multi-mission
force.
Firstly, Australia would need a basic
jet trainer able to double as a light
ground support aircraft, preferably of
local design. Some 200 of these would
form an effective replacement for the
Macchi at a later date and would easily
warrant full local construction.
Secondly, the fighter / bomber,
advanced trainer and high performance
reconnaissance roles could well be filled
by one type, instead of by the F- 111,
Canberra, Mirage, and Sabre, all of
which will have to be kept in service
for as long as possible to meet current
requirements. The Phantom is perhaps
the best present example of such an
aircraft, but there are several next
generation multi-mission types under
consideration overseas which could
ultimately be adapted to Australia’s
needs. Some 250 would form a very
effective force and would provide suf-
ficient work to support local construc-
tion also.
Thirdly, there is great demand for a
medium/heavy lift helicopter to meet
the big Army requirement and the
smaller Navy and Air Force needs. At
present some 80 helicopters made up
of five totally different types, each 100
percent dependent on foreign support,
perform these tasks rather inadequately.
A force of up to 200 machines of the
category of the Sikorsky S-61 or one
of its derivatives would justify local
construction.
There will probably emerge one day
a medium/heavy transport aircraft with
some degree of STOL capacity, and
as most modern anti -submarine mari-
time aircraft have been developed from
transport types, it is quite possible that
a satisfactory replacement for the
Orion and Neptune could be developed
from this basic type.
With careful planning and sensible
dovetailing of orders there would be
no reason why a healthy local in-
dustry could not undertake the con-
struction of these four types, over a
realistic period.
This would be good news for some
of the thousands of skilled tradesmen
and scientists who will be forced out
of the ailing British aircraft industry.
Many of them, too, will have had
experience in the complex fields of
titanium working and in the develop-
ment and production of the sophisti-
cated engines and weapons systems
which will be needed when the produc-
tion of the next generation high-per-
formance aircraft is undertaken.


THE SUB-TEENS
THE LITTLE GIRL on the hard
stadium bench was screaming wildly.
Her long, black, evenly cut hair was
flying round her head in dangerous
whips of passion guaranteed to damage
the eyes of anyone within range. Her
plump baby hands, braceleted and
painted, clutched her padded breast and
she bounced up and down in her
knicker outfit. Around her, tier upon
tier, were other little girls in various
states of emotional disturbance, all well
dressed and sitting in seats that had
cost several dollars each. They surged
and seethed with the music bouncing
up from the floodlit square where the
Who were literally smashing their in-
struments in an electronic frenzy. Most
of them were in girl packs, but here
and there a boy with long curly hair
was obviously an escort. There was the
odd flowered tie, smart jacket, and
booted foot showing in the mass of
femininity.
All these plump little creatures are
Australia’s Teeny Boppers, the young
teenagers modelling themselves with the
intensity of fanatics on their older
sisters; behind them, even younger
Boppers are trying to imitate the young
teenagers.
The term originated in Los Angeles,
where the Teeny Boppers are cast in
a much fiercer mould. There, on the
Sunset Strip, a ten o’clock curfew has
had to be introduced to get the roaming,
self-destructive band of youngsters in
off the street. These young kids, bliss-
fully trying out pot and LSD, swallow-
ing pills with the absorption of children
eating lollies at a party, are fortunately
not our problem, though we, too, have
our percentage of tough youngsters.
But for the most part, Australia’s
Teeny Boppers are the well-cosseted
children of an affluent generation. They
are given most of the things they want,
and life is for them a pleasant round
of school, parties, and home life, where*
again they have comfortable rooms,
good food, and the panacea of constant
television.
So what makes the child at the
concert scream so hysterically and
writhe in such abandonment? Accord-
ing to one expert, she is subconsciously
reacting to the subjugation she under-
goes every day of her life. As a child
in an adult world she is constantly
irritated by, to her, meaningless edicts
and commands. She resents them, but
cannot reasonably refuse them. (Pre-
sumably such fierce orders as “Eat your
breakfast” come into this category.) But
once in the thrill-packed auditorium,
surrounded by her peers, reality recedes,
and to the insistent beat of the music
she ceases to be an individual. She
forgets rational behaviour, she weeps
and faints and screams, shrieking her
transcendental message which could be
roughly translated as “Let me out!”
Everything the Teeny Bopper does is
an attempt at a breakthrough. The
nine-year-old who insists on having
mesh stockings and high heels, the 12-
year-old peering through gobs of mas-
cara, the little boy stalking about in an
Edwardian jacket, they are all pathetic-
ally looking for a door into the world
of authority where they can make their
own decisions.
It isn’t a new phenomenon. Children
have always tried to be grown-up be-
fore their time. They’ve smoked and
climbed out of windows and drunk
the cooking wine probably since the
first Elizabethan period, but they have
never before been quite so well catered
for. The urge to emerge prematurely
from childhood is exploited to the full
in these permissive days.
Mr. J. Rooklyn, member of the
Bangkok Stock Exchange and general
manager of Playland, Pitt Street,
Sydney (which surprisingly is a


$500,000 enterprise), leaned back in
his red leather chair and looked
severely over his pipe. “Whose fault is
it that the kids get so much?” he said.
“They don’t make the stuff. We do.
We manufacture the clothes and the
records and the sportsgear they want.
Then we cry because they want it.”
To find a very large panelled office
fitted with deep leather .couches and
rich carpeting at the top of the poky
stairs leading up from Playland’s
plethora of pin-ball machines and
snapping air rifles was almost as sur-
prising as Mr. Rooklyn himself, ex
Birtlin holiday camps and via the
Navy to Sydney and a partnership with
the late Lee Gordon.
He has a healthy respect for the
young people who come swaggering
into his parlor. “The very young ones
usually come in over the holidays and
at the weekends. Often they come with
parents. Most of them are decent, well-
controlled youngsters from ordinary
homes. We very rarely have any
trouble. Only once did we suspect a
lad should have been at school, and
eventually the Welfare Officer claimed
him. But for the most part they are
no smarter and no more sophisticated
than the kids were a generation ago.”
Rooklyn has had 25 years’ experi-
ence in handling juveniles, and he sees
no cause for alarm in the present
generation. “It isn’t only in Australia,
either. They are just the same in Hong
Kong or Singapore or Thailand, where
I also have amusement arcades. Re-
gardless of color or creed, a boy is just
a boy. The machines attract the boys,
though, of course, the boys in turn
attract the girls, so we see them, too.”
The troublemakers who have to be
dealt with occasionally are almost
always from homes where there is little
discipline. “I think the suburban clubs
have a great deal to answer for Mum
and Dad are off enjoying the Thursday
night 50-50 dance and playing poker
machines and they don’t really know
or care what their teenage sons are
doing. My customers are rarely short
of money. The most usual note changed
is two dollars, which is a fair amount
of money to spend on five-cent and
ten-cent machines.
“You know, there is nothing diffi-
cult to understand about these half-
grown kids. They need a lot of atten-
tion. They need their parents to spend
time with them, find time if their lives
are busy. Anyone can find time. It’s
tragic to see the loneliness sometimes.
I know one boy whose father’s only
contact with him is to give him money.
He thinks that by pressing a S2O note
in that kid’s hand that he’s doing him
a favor.”
The chilling pronouns of “they,”
“him,” and “she” have given many
parents pause when they overhear their
children talking. For the most part
the parents of the Teeny Boppers are
only in their early and mid-thirties,
and they find it hard to believe that
theirs is the square generation and
that they very definitely come under
the heading of oldies.
“My parents can’t dance, but they
do and it just curls me up,” one 13-
year-old confided. “They do things
like the Twist and the Swim and it’s
all dated and it’s terrible.” Her
agonised expression clearly showed that
she had suffered torments at a party
probably given for her by the parents.
She was sitting in a coffee
two equally young friends, earnestly if
rather nauseously drinking black coffee.
Her face was made up skilfully, her
float dress concealed her complete lack
of shape, her nervously bitten finger-
nails were painted a pale almost green
color. Her smile revealed the last traces
of orthodontistry.
“And you can’t tell them,” she said.
This is the key phrase in the com-
partmented world that separates the
Teeny Bopper from adult life. Lack
of communication, a language barrier
as deep and effective as a vow of silence
seems to operate in too many homes.
This is very frequently the cause
By APRIL HERSEY
when a child runs away. At some
point in the moody up-and-down world
of puberty, the isolation becomes too
big a burden, and what appears on the
surface to be a happy situation in a
normal home atmosphere irritates the
young teenager to the point of revolt.
He is off to join his own kind. With-
out thought of the consequences, like
an eager cub out hunting on his own
in the jungle for the first time, he is
away.
Enid Harris, social worker attached
to the Wayside Chapel at Kings Cross,
is appalled at the mobility of the run-
away today. “The ingenuity and the
speed they display is quite terrifying.
A girl can disappear in Brisbane and
before her parents have had time to
notify the police she’s in Melbourne.
“They move off without money
sometimes, supremely confident that
they will survive. I find them very
interesting, these 14- and 15-year-olds.
They can sort out their problems and
speak very fluently about them. At least
they can to me. They don’t seem to be
able to articulate their thoughts at
home.”
One 15-year-old was brought in for
counselling by a distraught mother,
who had found that instead of spend-
ing her two nights a week of free time
at approved youth clubs and with
friends, as arranged, she had been for
18 months leading a life of remarkable
debauchery with a crowd of motor-
cycle buffs. Wild beach parties, heavy
drinking, drugs, and sex were all very
old hat to this clever fourth-year high-
school girl. She had always been care-
ful to return to the youth club or to
the friend’s house where she had been
deposited by a loving parent in the
first place in time for the pick-up, Her
double life was accidentally discovered
when she failed to make the tran-
sition and slept the night in the back
of a car, too drunk to remember the
time. Police were called in to find who
had abducted her, but when she did
arrive home she was quite calm about
the whole business. Questioned by her
stunned parents, she was honest and
straightforward, denied nothing. Their
desperate: “Why didn’t you tell us?”'
was countered by: “Why didn’t you
ask?”
This breakdown seems to Miss Har-
ris to follow a pattern of often in-
advertent neglect. Parents who ring
in asking for help in locating a lost
child almost always harp on the sub-
ject that they have given them every-
thing. Very rarely do they say: “Help
me to find her because I love her.”
Sometimes embattled parents are
unaware that their friction is rubbing
off on sensitive older children and that
their constant bickering is creating an
intolerable situation for the emerging
young adult.
One 14-year-old boy from Brisbane,
located in Kings Cross by the police,
was asked sternly why he had left
home. “But I was the last to go,” he
said. “First Dad ran off and then
Mum left and I was there by myself.
Why should I stay there sweeping the
floors and getting myself off to
school?” The parents were angry with
each other, but when the boy left they
joined forces to demand his return.
The demands of parents are often the
reason for the constant escapism of the
Teeny Bopper. One clever woman
executive has placed such demands of
perfection on a 15-year-old that she
is now regarded as an uncontrollable
child. She has run away so often, been
remanded and taken to shelters so fre-
quently that her next step is the Parra-
matta Girls’ Home. Each time her
father finds her, once even locating her
in bed with a stray boyfriend, he rescues
her and takes her back to his affluent
and successful world. “But it is never
the mother who comes,” Miss Harris
said. “And that is all she wants. She
told me her father used to tuck her in
at night. She doesn’t want her mother’s
ambition for her. She will never take
up the same profession, though she is
quite capable. She is destroying herself
in an effort to attract her mother’s
attention.
“The troubles are not always the
parents’ fault. Other pressures often
cause the break. Parents are blamed
very often, but if they treat their chil-
dren like thinking human beings and
keep up with the world around them I
don’t think they can go wrong. This
moving ahead, being aware, is terribly
important.
“To me this seems to be the age
of thinking for the teenager. He is
opinionated and he feels he has the
right to an opinion. The father who
decries drugs while never missing his
few beers at the pub is living a lie
to his son. The woman who doesn’t


read the papers or know what is hap-
pening is an embarrassment to a
daughter who is sharply aware of the
world.”
The new style of broader education
has driven something of a wedge be-
tween the hopefully omniscient parent
and the child. The parent is fre-
quently outclassed by first-year high
school and has none of the answers.
The child is quick to notice and always
ready to humiliate.
But to the high-school teacher the
fast-growing pupils in her class seem
to have little mystery.
“I find them quite steady, sensible
youngsters,” one said. “I probably
wouldn’t recognise them out of school.
But here they generally are very inter-
ested. They know they must work
hard if they mean to get an education
and they are all pretty much aware
that if they don’t they. will have very
ordinary jobs.
“What does amaze me often is their
complete lack of ambition. They all
seem to have very stereotyped ideas
of what they want out of life. The
girls want marriage ultimately, but now
they all add the proviso that they
want to have something else that will
bring money in their early married
years and be an interest when the
children are grown up. The boys are
all looking to a very stolid security.
Nobody seems to want to be a test
pilot or to climb Everest despite the
Duke of Edinburgh’s incentives.
“Sometimes I think they are all very
much older and more cautious than we
were at that age. Though the question
on the Depression was considered the
hardest to answer in the School Certifi-
cate history paper because no one can
imagine what it was like, they don’t
want to find out, either. They think
about getting married, and look out for
jobs that will bring a satisfactory
amount of income, and not for jobs that
will be primarily satisfactory to them.
It is a very serious generation no matter
what effect the pop stars have.”
This feeling is strengthened when you
discuss teenage banking. Almost all
youngsters opening a savings account
ask about Home Savings or know all
about it. It seems extraordinary to have
12-year-olds and young teens solemnly
saving up for their future homes in
order to take advantage of the Govern-
ment grant in the far distance. But they
are shrewd bankers. They deposit much
more than they withdraw.
Where the spending power comes
from is obviously Dad’s bank account,
which is frequently overdrawn. “I know
that kids want everything,” one father
said. “But what upsets me is when
my boy wants everything that all his
friends have. So if Joe has a guitar and
Mike has a car and Jim has a surf-
board, my bloke doesn’t just want one
of those things. He wants the lot.”
The estimated spending power of the
American teenager has been put at so
many millions of dollars an hour, but
the Australians are not quite so well
catered for. The girls can buy padded
bras at ten, girdles and wigs and false
eyelashes. A wig-shop employee recalled
the ten-year-old who wanted long hair.
Instead of being encouraged to grow it,
her parents had a special blonde wig
made to fit her, providing her with an
instant mane.
Make-up (which is worn from age
nine in some cases) is very much
geared to the young face today. The
pale lipsticks and transparent powders
are intended for the child-woman. Mary
Quant’s Paintbox (approximately $10)
is only a step beyond a little girl’s
paintbox from which experimental
rouge and lipstick have long been
stolen from the Rose Madder square.
The Quant demonstrator at David
Jones’ Elizabeth Street store, herself
a small English Teeny Bopper, ex-
plained how the make-up works. For
the shapeless face of infancy, the
puppy-fatted little round cheeks, there
are face-shapers, pressed powders in
ivory and brown to create the shadows
that have not yet formed. The Quant
perfume called succinctly AM and PM
is meant for Boppers. “Red roses,
violins,” burbles the advertising. “What
on earth has that got to do with us
our generation? Things like the back
row of the flicks, sand, and suntan oil,
or the bitter taste of Campari, are the
stuff of our lovely memories.” Mary
Quant’s memories, incidentally, go back
almost as far as some of the scorned
parents, for this lady, despite her
youthful clothes, is actually on the
wrong side of thirty.
John Hemmes, sideburned and
suave in his thriving House of Meri-
vale, in Castlereagh Street, Sydney,
which pulsates with music and Teeny
Boppers who start shopping there at a
very early age, does not believe that
fashion being conceived today is only
for the young. Despite the leggy little
girls climbing up and down his stairs
as though they have reached the
promised land, he firmly believes that
fashion is only meant to be fun and it
shouldn’t be taken too seriously.
“Any woman with a reasonable shape
can get away with most of this gear.
Even in their forties they can wear
tailored garments in the young styles.
Why shouldn’t they? I think fashion
should be inexpensive and meant to
last only a season or two. If you want
to take it seriously and buy something
for a lifetime, well, buy something in
leather,” he paused. “Actually, leather
will be very popular this winter.”
This slightly off-beat philosophy
which discards at one sweep all the
established attitudes toward good dress-
ing is probably why this tiny shop has
had such a phenomenal success. Only
opened four years ago, it now does as
much trade as the dress department in
Some of the Teeny Boppers at a recent
series of pop concerts at Sydney
Stadium
a large store. Two factories are needed
to keep it filled.
Hemmes goes overseas three or four
times a year to London and Paris, and
his stock is so completely on the
Boppers’ wavelength that he has literally
outgrown the local manufacturers.
Even Australia’s young designers are
six months off target. He has found he
has to produce his own designs month
by month.
“They are very perceptive, these
young customers of mine. They know
exactly what is happening in the big
capitals of the world. They were asking
for Bonnie and Clyde fashions before
‘Time’ magazine had published a review
of the film. They’ll get them, too. I’ve
registered the name and we’ll copy
the long dresses of the ’thirties for
them.”
He is Mr. John to all his customers,
most of whom are, like their idols, long-
haired, short-skirted, made-up with
expertise, and jumping up and down.to
the sound of music. He is a tall,
acceptable 30-plus gentleman, a cross
between a salesman and a showman.
The little girls look upon him as
some benevolent Santa Claus who actu-
ally provides the brown velvet suits,
the ruffled blouses, and dolly-dolly
dresses on cue while they are still sell-
ing in London. His assistants at the
present time all look like Josja, the
tousle-headed Dutch friend of the


Right and above right, serious or
screaming, the young girl at a pop
concert is in a world of her own

Beatles and other expensive hippies.
Her clothes are scraps of brilliant cloth
mainly in the patchwork tradition,
which has resulted in a happy eccen-
tricity in downtown Sydney, but only
in the eyes of the uninitiated. In his
Edwardian jacket Hemmes wonders if
it really matters what they wear. Cer-
tainly many parents could take a
more lenient view, for in the long run
all fashion is absurdity.”
Things are not quite so wild in the
department stores. At Farmer’s, Miss
Marian Claudius buys dresses for the
Young Sydney Department. This year
the styles were really very young The
dolly dresses are just like the party
dresses once designed for six-year-olds
, . , , , , a.a. a
an tey o oo e er on young een-
agers than on 40-year-olds, despite
the philosophies of Menvale. So do
the knicker suits, which also sold fast
in “the department stores.
“Girls start coming in here while
they are still at primary school. They
look in the Tweens sections upstairs—
that used to be the Maids and then
they come here. By the time they are
in high school this is quite a stamping
ground.” A pretty, very young executive,
Miss Claudius pines for music in the
emporium, but it is against store
policy.
“A lot of money is spent on girls.
They have several outfits in every
season, even before they are halfway
through school. By the time they are
working they often buy something every
week.”
Boys are not quite so well catered
for. Their fixations seem to be on
length of hair and on covering their
spots with brilliantly named lotions,
rnost of which appear to be related
stage make-up. Their surge forward
i nto manhood is frequently sidetracked
by crazes like slot cars and by a devo-
tion to the beach. They are not in-
dined toward heroism even here, and
their interest in war is so slight that
they are bored and half resistant to the
school-cadet training schemes. Interest
j? handling the guns is paramount.
Ihe mystique of war has largely been
disbursed for them. After having seen
excerpts from Vietnam as a steady
feature on television for what must
seem most Q f t h e ir lives, they cannot
be blamed for lack of interest. Men
dying as you eat your chop and worry
about your homework hasn’t much
relation to the “Blue Max.”
The young boys under 15 don’t
seem to want to change the world so
much as to get a safe niche where their
generation can survive. Their irritation
w ith adults still burdened by dreams
Q f world peace and concerned about
which ism should be triumphant is
transitory. They may run away from
us, rebel and show frustration in bad
temper and bad manners, but it is a
symptom of impatience to be able to
control their own destiny, no matter
how narrow the horizon,
A curiously questing group, who
may yet overcome their parents*
depression-haunted obsession to provide
them with everything at once, these-
under-fifteens are not likely to take
Flower Bower too seriously when they
are older teenagers. The beards and
the beads of the hippies will not appear
to the future stalwarts of the Stock
Exchange.
No doubi they are already in the-
trough of the wave of some new craze
as yet unborn, but this is the gen-
eration listening to the words as well
as the music. Donovan s Legend of
the Girl Child Linda” and the Beatles’
“She’s Leaving Home” are their kind
of songs.
Absurd and cute in mini-skirts and
fake eyelashes, heads crammed with
science, surrounded always by the
voices of their gods emanating from the
plastic trannies, growing so much
larger than their parents that some
fathers are waiting to inherit their sons’
sports coats, flip, bouncy, too articu-
late for comfort, what a tumult and a
shoving is coming up the line!
“But isn’t it amazing,” as the man
from Playland said, “how each suc-
ceeding difficult generation turns into
such a pleasant crop of adults?”

The future is bullish
at Taronga
By CHARLES HIGHAM
FEEDING TIME behind the monkey
cells: we might as well be in a dwarf’s
version of Long Bay. A long, low stone
corridor, tiny green metal doors, and in
the stench and heat, the reddish hulks
of the orang-utans, shrivelled old men’s
faces with blind, bright eyes emerging
from aureoles of straw-flecked fur as
huge fists shake the bars. Door-bolts
slide back with a deafening clang as
each monkey is released in turn from
a small to a larger cage, while the
keeper sustains a determinedly cheerful
commentary: “Men can go in there, but
not women. They don’t seem to take to
women, somehow. And Charlie here
he’s a big one, as you can see threw
us out of the cage one day. This one,
she wouldn’t let me out once, but I
think she only wanted some company.”
Keeper Bill Sykes smiles as a ferocious
animal hurls fistfuls of sawdust at us
through the bars. “You wouldn’t want
to go in there on your own,” says Sykes,
as a mountain of bananas, pineapples,
and spinach is made ready for those
slavering mouths. “They eat eight
pounds of porridge of a morning. And
they like tea, just as we do. Give them
the wrong amount of milk and sugar
and they’ll throw it right back at you.”
The big cats seem scarcely more
inviting, although their keeper, Brian
Adamson, is just as calm, saying, as we
hear the door-rattling of the caged
tigers, ‘They’re fiercer when they’re
born 111 ra P tivit y than they are in the
jungle. Because here they don’t have

them, of course. All day the tigers
prowl their grimly bare stone enclosures,
or sleep in almost motionless heaps
vyhile the public grins at them through
the bars. lor all the laughter of the
audience, the bristle of the holiday
crowds, and the beauty of the setting
above Athol Bay, Taronga Zoo still
seems, in many ways, as depressing as
a J ad -
Yet it will not always be so. Ronald
Strahan, the dynamic new Zoo direc-
tor, driving in his white car round the
narrow, badly laid lanes of the hill-
side, working a ferocious schedule, has
ambitious plans, and has already wrung
large sums in cash from a once-
apathetic Government,
Taronga Zoo was founded in 1916,
at a cost of $209,040 dollars. It
replaced Moore Park Zoo, always
unpopular with the residents’ of Pad-
dington because the roaring of the
lions kept them awake at nieht When
nuns Kepi uk.hi auaKe at mgm. vvnen
Premier Holman opened the new Zoo,
it was described as “the greatest show
on earth.” Taronga meant “ocean
view,” and the superb site was
originally known as Ashton Park.
Since then, the Zoo has often been
attacked never more fiercely than
under the embattled Sir Edward Hall-
strom, who poured much of his per-
sonal fortune into its upkeep, but who
was skewered by a report by Dr. H.
Heidiger, of the Zurich Zoo, in 1966.
Popular with the public because of his
frequent appearances in Press photo-
graphs holding baby animals high, Sir
The director of Taronga Zoo, Mr. Ronald Strahan, supervises the building of a new artificial marsh for some of the Zoo’s deer


Edward was often thought much less
well of by scientists.
Heidiger, like everyone else, savaged
the old-fashioned, seedy, and run-down
look of the Zoo (while giving due
credit to Hallstrom’s excellence as a
gifted amateur), and Sir Edward spoke
of a conspiracy: “There’s been a lot of
talking in Parliament and Press, but it
all boils down to one fact. Someone—
I’m not saying who it is doesn’t
want me connected with the Zoo.”
Ronald Strahan, formerly Senior Lec-
turer in Zoology at the University of
N.S.W., has been in charge since last
March, and has been given much help
by the Minister for Lands.
Overcrowding has always been an
ugly feature of the Zoo: horrible to
see giant animals stuffed into iron boxes
not much bigger than kennels behind
their public showcase, and one recalls
the often-quoted remark of a colum-
nist of a few years ago: “If Taronga
crams any more kangaroos and walla-
bies into that grim, concrete enclosure,
they’ll have to breathe alternately.”
But futures are bullish at Taronga.
As the well-oiled Zoo public-relations
machine has already been pounding into
us over the past nine months, we are
soon going to see a new Zoo, with
moats instead of stark stone-and-wire
fences, grass-laid enclosures, and walk-
through aviaries: a Zoo, in fact, that
will not make the term “park” look like
an indifferent joke.
Today, much of the Zoo still looks
like a Luna Park as well as a Long
Bay for beasts: a bizarre and crudely
Thorn hush is replacing barbed wire
outside the elephants’ cage
painted “Indian” temple complete with
dome marks the elephant enclosure,
lions prowl in imitation canyons, and
the aquarium is a three-tier labyrinth in
Tunnel-of-Love Modern, with concrete-
and-plaster ceilings and walls, giving
an effect of some suburban dramatic
society’s pantomime idea of Aladdin’s
cave. Over the shark’s pool, a stuffed
crocodile sits with permanently open
jaws, invaded only by the omnipresent
flies. The glass screens are much too
small, the tanks cramped as we peer
through inch-thick glass at axolotls walk-
ing on webbed feet, octopuses writhing-
in a mesh of rubbery limbs and white
suckers, and perch mouthing inanely. I
look in vain for piranhas, those pretty
Latin Americans which can reduce a
man to teeth-fillings and signet ring in
30 seconds. “They’re a prohibited im-
port,” says the keeper. “And besides,
they eat their plastic containers.”
Eventually, one hopes, Strahan will
reduce this bizarre fish palace-cum-
grotto to rubble, and the Indian temple
will presumably follow the crumbling
miniature Sydney Harbor Bridge, which
once embellished the duckpond, into
oblivion. “We’ve been making plenty
of money flogging off our scrap metal
lately,” Ronald Strahan told me proudly,
conjuring up a vision of iron bars and
steel mesh carried off in truckloads.
In his office, with its fraying green
armchairs and atmosphere of 1930 s
gentility, Strahan, leonine and obviously
dedicated, talked about the gigantic
job of running the Zoo. There is a
staff of 95 keepers, most of them
reserved, shy men with pale, distant
eyes, and the slightly uneasy air of
someone who has spent more of his
life saying things like, “Feeding time,
Susie,” to a boa constrictor or a baboon
than in making small talk with human
beings. Most of the keepers are shifted
around from one batch of animals to
another, although (“There’s Peters, he’s
a. very good man on reptiles”) some are
allowed finally to specialise.
Under these men’s care are 1000
animals, 2500 birds, 200 reptiles, and
1000 fishes, many of which have very
peculiar diets. Koalas, the Zoo’s public-
relations woman told me, will eat only
the fresh tips of specific gums, glossy
black parrots will eat nothing but
casuarina cones, and dolphins and pen-
guins are kinky for yellow-tails. Reptiles
don’t read this if you’re eating
enjoy only freshly killed mice and
pigeons: the pigeons are specially bred
and slaughtered by the Zoo. And
horses are killed on the premises in a
slaughterhouse, their meat served in
giant, dripping steaks to the carnivores.
A Zoo is like a small town, with
birth, life cycle, and death, matings,
and battles (mainly for predominance
between young and old males) causing
as much gossip among the keepers as
they would among tradesmen in a local
pub. Inhabitants are on a permanent
daily theatre stage, almost always
watched, whether from the winding
paths or from high crags. Does out-
presence concern them? “The monkeys
know we’re there, of course,” Strahan
said. “But most of the other animals
aren’t really aware of us. Except for
the animals which dislike being watched
from above the animals used to
being prey. Walk above the deer on
the north side of their enclosure, and
you’ll see every eye swing, startled, in
your direction.” He doesn’t feel that
animals in the Zoo are to be pitied,
since they appear to be content once
their breeding and feeding requirements
are satisfied. But he does feel that there
is a problem of boring the more intel-
ligent creatures. “You see a chimp or
a gorilla, staring blankly into space. We
must give them more to do. And I
agree that our leopards really don’t
have enough room.”
Forty thousand people visit the Zoo
a week, and it costs $70,000 a month to
run. Strahan has upped the official
annual Government grant from $6OOO
to $150,000 in the past year, and points
out that the Zoo, until this increase, had
been virtually self-supporting, just
breaking even except in the inspired
“King Kong years” of the early ’sixties,
when that famous gorilla earned the
Zoo a healthy profit with its theatrical
antics.
Despite the improvements he has
already brought about the Zoo looks
altogether better-swept, the animals are
just beginning to be better housed
Strahan admits that the drains are
poor, the water system fails to work,
and the ferry wharf is in ghastly shape.
Overcrowding has been stopped:
Strahan has been “flogging animals all
over the show.” He has even sent “coals
to Newcastle, or giraffes to South
Africa,” and tigers, antelopes, elephants,
and polar bears have been marketed
vigorously. The animals are so healthy
in the Zoo that they don’t die very
often; when they do, they are burned
in incinerators or packed off to labora-
tories in universities for research.
Animals aren’t, just because they are
in a zoo, tame; not even the fish, which,
the aquarium keeper told me, often
violently attack each other if they’re
left too long together in a small tank,
and will even tear and rend their own
species. You only have to see the terri-
fying leap of the lioness at the bars of
her cage as visitors come to see her
cubs to realise that for all their
apparent glamor, Zoos are not exactly
places of charm. And the sight of the
reptiles is altogether daunting: trans-
parent watchglass eyes staring at you
through flat rocks, the sudden stiffen-
ing of a snake’s body as the tongue
flickers and the poison sacs prepare.
One doubts that even if Strahan gets
his wish and Taronga Zoo is made
worthy of its site, it will ever seem other
than unsettling. But he points out that
much of the pain one feels in seeing
these creatures, our prisoners, will
vanish in his new settings. “We even
had some outside silver gulls trying to
get into the gull cages. And we had
two blue-winged kookaburras in a bare
cage. They didn’t laugh for two years.
Finally we installed a fountain and
some grass. They’ve been laughing ever
since.”

SINGAPORE
UNSCRAMBLING
IT WAS one of those numerous organi-
sations, nominally, if not substantially,
devoted to the enhancing of Austral-
asian friendship. The boring and
platitudinous meeting was proceeding
—some six or seven years ago—in a
hall somewhere around the St. Kilda
Road area in Melbourne. I would have
left but for my Indonesian friend’s
attentive concern.
Afterwards I asked his opinion of
it all. “Five years ago when I first
came here those people at the meet-
ing,” he replied, stressing “those people”
with understanding irony, “those people
had a fad for poodles. Now they’re
not patting poodles, they’re patting
Asians instead.”
I don’t know what became of my
friend. I would like to think he stayed
on to become an Australian citizen.
He was the kind of person who could
now be helping Australians discover a
renewed, fresh sense of urgency to-
gether with a passion for human
equality, two qualities particularly
needed in this present situation when it
is more than ever necessary to take a
hard look at an old situation and at
enduring realities in order to obtain
a new vision.
South-East Asia is a complicated
jigsaw puzzle. The British piece with
Australian and New Zealand coloring,
which still fits into that jigsaw, is now
being hurriedly removed. Will that
unscramble the whole puzzle? Or can
another piece, say a purely Australian
and New Zealand one, be substituted?
Or will a new puzzle or a different
game inevitably take the place of the
old one?
As in a jigsaw puzzle there are many
parts and all the parts relate to each
other. “Regional security” is a mis-
nomer in the first place and not a
simple answer to a single threat in the
second. Better then to think in terms
of how the region can live with a wide
range of varying insecurities. Western
countries and Japan love to hope that
their defence or aid policies will pro-
mote political stability when, for most
developing countries, and developing
nationalism, an uneasy equilibrium
amid various competing or comple-
mentary instabilities is the best that
can be hoped for.
South-East Asian nations are indeed
“living on top of a social volcano that
can erupt any day with or even with-
out communist prodding.” (One might
well continue the quotation. South-
East Asia certainly “has no time to
lose, but must mobilise without delay
all the resources of the community to
attack the social problem at its root.”)
“Security” depends a great deal on
two questions: Can South-East Asian
nations mobilise? If so, will they?
Before turning to the multiplied
effects of accelerated British withdrawal,
what is being withdrawn?
Behind the target date of 1971 lies a
different reality from that announced
last June. Apart from the ostensible
flexibility of a mid-’seventies departure,
it was then intended to leave behind
“base capability” in Singapore such as
would render more effective military
forces or reinforcements flown in from
the outside. Even this is now going.
The three airfields in Singapore at
Seletar, Tengah, and Changi; the huge
naval base at Sembawang; the troops
in Singapore—excluding Marine com-
mandoes on the carriers Albion and
Bulwark, each with a battalion aboard,
based in Singapore but usually afloat—
now two battalions of British Gurkhas
and one squadron of British troops, the
70 ships of the Far Eastern Fleet rang-
ing from the carriers Ark Royal, Eagle,
and Hermes to mothballed mine-
sweepers; the huge base facilities in
Singapore occupying some 10,000
“non-fighting troops,” but which can
supply and support a very large influx
as they did during Confrontation with-
out further expansion; two Gurkha
battalions based in Malayasia; one
British battalion in the Commonwealth
brigade at Terendak, PLUS the 2000
support troops servicing the British,
Australian, and New Zealand brigade;
the 800 RAF support airmen servicing
the RAAF base at Butterworth;
numerous other miscellaneous items
which military presences naturally
accrete. This is a sizable chunk of per-
sonnel and hardware in anybody’s
language, most of all in the language of
power.
It will not be withdrawn gradually,
imperceptibly over eight to ten years
with some facilities left behind for
reactivation. It is—presumably—to be
suddenly, traumatically wound up in
three years with so far only one facility
{jromised to remain—the radar defences
ooking north at Butterworth and look-
ing south at Singapore. By 1971 these
will be in Malaysian and Singaporean
hands again, presumably expanded into
a joint air-defence system. Also, Lee
Kuan Yew will evidently be retaining
the Bloodhound ground-to-air missiles
which the British leave in Singapore.
In passing it is as well to note what
will be left behind elsewhere amidst
the west-of-Suez scramble. There will
be a 10,000-man garrison in Hong
Kong, including four battalions of
Gurkhas, and one Gurkha battalion
will remain in Brunei until the end
of that oil-Sultanate’s Protectorate.
Just how the Brunei Shcllfare State
would be “protected” by one battalion
of Ghurkas were trouble once more to
arise in neighboring Sabah and Sara-
wak is hard to see. The case of Hong
Kong is more worth speculating about.
Would the four Ghurka battalions be
sent to Malaysia in case of need while
Hong Kong was reinforced from Lon-
don? Or would' they have to stay in
Hong Kong to maintain their combi-
nation of tripwire and security roles?
The frantic way in which Britain
has changed policy overnight has almost
had the unhappy effect of persuading
The Gurkha battalions in Malaysia are to be disbanded. Gurkhas have fought for
Britain for centuries and are regarded by many as the world’s finest soldiers

THE PUZZLE
By HARVEY STOCKWIN
some she had withdrawn already. For
this reason the trouble that has now
arisen in Mauritius is providential in
that it serves as a reminder that this is
not so. Nevertheless this fast rundown
to the point of disappearance will itself
have an impact on regional security by
its very abruptness. In theory four
years remain. But in practice what
impact will the presence make or be
capable of making once the withdrawal
gets well under way? It could be
argued that the presence were better
gone than causing additional strains
by its non-use.
But suppose the Conservatives are
returned to power a near certainty
provided De Gaulle’s departure
doesn’t allow Wilson to enter Europe
before the next elections. What then?
A base capability? Or a retained mili-
tary presence? Foreign Minister Brown
is right in saying that the Conservative
pledge “enlarged the area of uncer-
tainty,” though he and his colleagues
have done most of the enlarging.
Speaking for the Conservatives, Mr.
Maudling is also correct to stipulate
that “if the Labor Government has
not in some way or another totally
sabotaged any chance of reversing that
policy, reverse it we certainly shall.”
By 1971 plans will have been made
and policies redirected on the basis
of the British piece being removed.
Will these plans take into account the
possibility of its being retained? Will
it by then have any chance of fitting
into the puzzle?
In measuring the impact of acceler-
ated withdrawal another prior question
presents itself: How does the British
presence fit in at the moment?
It fits into the overall power situa-
tion via three legalities:
• First and foremost there is the Anglo-
Malaysian Defence Treaty to which
Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore
all adhere even though they are not
parties to it. The Treaty underpins the
presence. While their greater military
muscle gives the British that much more
proportionate a say, its essence lies in
its provision for mutual consultations.
In turn, given such consultations, the
presence is available for wider functions.
• This leads on to the second legality —
SEATO. Ever since its inception
SEATO has been a subject of debate,
particularly by way of unfavorable com-
parison with NATO. Nonetheless it,
too, “fits.” The Malaysian leaders, for
example, have never sought to become
parties to SEATO, while all the while
noting that Britain’s SEATO com-
mitment worked to support the main-
tenance of the Anglo-Malaysian Defence
Treaty and vice versa. More important,
SEATO stands today as the sole legal
underpinning of the American com-
mitment—ever growing in size—to
Thailand. There is no United States-
Thailand defence treaty.
• Thirdly, the ANZAC accession to
the Anglo-Malaysian Defence Treaty is
formalised through the ANZAM Agree-
ment, which, in turn, underpins the
' Commonwealth Brigade at Terendak
and the Anglo-Australian air base at
Butterworth.
If these are the legalities, what of
Tunku Abdul Rahman, who recently gave an honorary doctorate to Philippines
President Marcos, sees regional co-operation as the hope for security in S.-E. Asia
the politics? Most important, how did
these treaties relate to local nationalism?
To my knowledge the greatest “nation-
alist upsurge” against the Anglo-
Malaysian Defence Treaty was the very
first., It is generally long since for-
gotten that many branches of UMNO
(United Malays National Organisa-
tion, one of three parties making up
the Alliance Coalition) were strongly
against the Treaty when it accompanied
Merdeka (independence) in 1957. The
UMNO youth organisation was then
particularly vehement against this “post-
colonial position.” This was the first
time the Tunku threatened to resign.
The agitation tailed off. It speaks
volumes for the situation I am describing
that, while the Tunku has threatened
resignation on other issues since then, he
has not had to use this sanction vis-a-vis
the British presence. Or, to put it
another way, the Australian Labor
Party was objecting to foreign troops
in Malaysia long after most Malaysian
nationals had accepted them as a fact
of life. Anti-British sentiments and
even “campaigns” there have been, but
in the broad the Defence Treaty has
been accepted.
In this respect, however, it is im-
portant to note how events themselves
made acceptance easier. At Merdeka
time the British were still heavily in-
volved in Malaysian internal security,
winding up the Emergency, and then
Sukarno’s confrontation did nothing to
encourage those who might otherwise
have objected to the Treaty’s further
extension via the London-Malaysia
Agreement. Meanwhile, as the years
passed, the Anglo-Anzacs were careful
(if not always successful-r-but much
more successful than the Americans in
Vietnam) to leave the Malaysians in
charge as much as possible, even at some
inconvenience to themselves, and to
stick to the mutuality provision no
matter what. Sometimes the Malaysians
weren’t as reciprocal of this considera-
tion as they might have been; the
abrupt way, for instance, that the
Anglo-Anzacs were “read out” of the
Joint Defence Council at a meeting'
once Confrontation ended, did give un-
published offence. But then, so did the
manner of the abrupt British with-
drawal from Borneo, when equipment
was destroyed instead of being written
off to the Malaysian Army as it took
over responsibility. Significantly, when
I got hold of this unhappy story, two
Malaysian Cabinet Ministers, while con-
firming it, requested that it be played
down—a good illustration of how the
Alliance leaders have preferred the
Defence Treaty in their hand to all the
possible inconveniences in the bush.
So, too, have the Singapore PAP

leaders, though, in the heady days of
their anti-British struggle, elimination of
the bases was a national goal. Had
Malaysia jelled and had Singapore’s
economic future been assured within it,
then maybe the PAP might have played
to the national gallery by reviving the
demand. Separate and alone, the PAP
was in no position to court the elimina-
tion of their base economy. To be fair,
over the separation years the never-
ending stream of speeches, to which
Singaporean citizens are daily subject,
has contained a large proportion of
references to the power advantages of
a continuing British presence. But the
same Lee Kuan Yew who, when the
chips were down in London, could not
bring himself to embarrass Wilson in
the same way as he once embarrassed
Dean Rusk (by releasing private letters
to the Press), must or should have been
haunted by the thought of how he had
not so long ago contributed to the end he
was in London trying to forestall. Seek-
ing Afro-Asian recognition for his inde-
pendence he talked about being able to
request the British to go at 24 hours’
notice, once even talked of inviting the
Russians in, forgetting thereby he was
giving ammunition to the Left-wing
Little Englanders he so much despises
today. Lee was not alone in wrongly
imagining that the British presence
“fitted in” to a British world view.
Singapore particularly realises that
the presence fitted into its own economy
to perhaps a larger extent than large
fixed bases fit into the theorising of
modern military planners. Together
with multiplier effects, the Singapore
bases account for between 20 and 25
percent of the gross national product.
In a region where jobs and politics
closely mesh, the more important fact
is that the base facilities are labor-
intensive economic assets. Nor is the
proportionally smaller economic effect
in Malaysia negligible. During Con-
frontation, for example, military spend-
ing contributed to the continuing health
of the Malaysian balance of payments,
though this effect is somewhat
diminished now.
Questions of how the British presence
has side effects which may become,
unintentionally or otherwise, major
justifications cannot be put across on
the domestic political scene back in
England, and would scarcely be under-
stood even if they were, but historically
British imperial policy not only created
the framework of the modern Malayan-
Malaysian State and created Singa-
pore. It also gave both colonies their
multi - racial substance. Immigrant
Chinese, Indonesians, and Indians were
encouraged to join the original Malays
and older-established Chinese settlers.
They were needed for the rubber estates
and tin mines and for the whole com-
mercial enterprise. Race relations have
several times reached boiling point in
Singapore, while even since World War
II there has been a violent dust-up

between Cantonese and Hokkiens in
Kuala Lumpur. The British delayed
their Malayan departure, while, on the
one hand, fighting an Emergency for
anti-communal as well as anti-
communist reasons, and, on the other,
until a multi-racial power—the Alliance
coalition—emerged to take over the
British role. Even after Merdeka the
British presence still helped “hold the
ring” by making sure the communist
bid for Chinese hegemony failed.
Thereafter, Britain ceased to be
nominally and physically involved in
internal security, but it would be idle
to pretend that psychologically the
“presence” was not still involved. It
deterred the Communists as much as it
gave additional self-confidence to the
nationalists. And, apart from anything
else, the South-East Asian riddle
remains—can you in reality divorce
internal security from international
security? For example, if the recent
Penang communal riots had become a
really major flare-up, spreading through
the towns and kampongs of western
Malaysia, reaching such dimensions that
Chin Peng and his Malayan Communist
Party colleagues on the Thai border
found conditions right to get busy again
—what then? Would the Anglo-Anzac
presence sit tight and say, “Sorry, in-
ternal security”? Just to indicate the
complexity, to what extent does this
problem relate to the Thai view of
insecurity? To what extent does Chin
Peng remain a potential threat, because
Bangkok fears Thai-Moslem and Thai-
Malay-Mosletn seccessionist aspirations
more than they fear the Communists?
Be that as it may, Mr. Thomson’s
“My dear Harry” letter to Lee Kuan
Yew is worth noting. The Anglo-Anzacs
would do all they could, said Mr.
Thomson, to help Singapore and
Malaysia maintain their national
security. But the point is that national
security in South-East Asia is not only
threatened when borders are crossed.
The balance-holding function became
international during Confrontation.
Sukarno’s confrontation was among
other things an assault toward Malay
racialism, which the Alliance resisted
despite Lee Kuan Yew arousing Malay
fears at the same time. The Com-
munists tried to ride the Djakarta tiger
in the hope that racial chaos would
unseat everybody except themselves. On
top of this, the British presence was
defending the new communal arrange-
ment —Malaysia—no doubt partly in
the hope that the Malaysian solution
would facilitate their quicker with-
drawal by establishing the best possible
basis for enduring politico-communal
harmony with speedy economic advance
to underpin it. Theoretical hopes gave
way to a practical disaster. Separation
not only left the British straddling the
Causeway, but also in a very subtle but
real sense still “holding the ring.”
Separation raised again, in some ways
more acutely, the questions the forma-
tion of Malaysia was meant to answer.
Separation also implied that the British
departure would be delayed, not
accelerated. In what form was the com-
munal balance to be peacefully and
politically sustained? How were Singa-
pore and the overseas Chinese, whose
interests Lee Kuan Yew articulated and
asserted, to fit into the South-East Asian
pattern? Was Lee’s Singapore destined
to be regarded as an eastern-supported
“Israel” in a predominantly Moslem
area, setting in train a similarly Israel-
like chain of action and reaction? Or
could Singapore and Singaporeans fit
into the regional ASEAN scheme of
things? Would ASEAN have the appeal
of Maphilindo without its racial impli-
cations? Could the Malaysia-Indonesia-
Singapore triangle work out an endur-
ing emotional and political relationship
sustained by mutual need, tolerance,,
and acceptance? Or were Malay-
Indonesian relations with the minority
Chinese within “their” area tragically
and inevitably headed on collision
course?
Today there is observable only an
uncertain mixture of happy portents
and unhappy omens. Will there be any
clearcut answers by 1971? Or are the
British, despite the role bequeathed
upon them by political acceptability, by
history, by circumstances, and in part
by their own lack of finesse, abdicating
their psychological and power function
before all these unanswered questions
can be reasonably and happily subject
to tlie sorting out processes of time?

OVERSEAS
The War -1
This is the big one
Bodies of Viet Cong laid out after the attack on Da Nang last Thursday
A VC killed in the U.S. Embassy
GENERAL GIAP has set it roll-
ing. This is the big battle, at last.
Beautifully synchronised, and timed for
the middle of the truce, the action he
opened last week should settle the
Vietnam war one way or the other.
General Giap is one of the best tactical
commanders of our generation. He
seizes the local initiative by moving his
troops faster than anyone has a right
to expect given the other side’s con-
trol of the air. And he is a master of
the surprise diversion. Last week’s
attacks by the Viet Cong on eleven
South Vietnamese cities unmistakably
bear his stamp: though the Viet Cong
is nominally an independent army, its
last known commander was a North
Vietnamese general and it does not
plunge in like this unless General Giap
gives the word. In all these things
and in the way he cannot stop him-
self jumping in to take tactical control
at the key moment in the fight ■ —
General Giap is remarkably like an-
other great tactical commander: Erwin
Rommel.
But he may resemble Rommel in
another way, too. Rommel in north-
west Europe in 1944 was a master-
tactician trying to cope with what he
knew was in the long run a strategically
hopeless situation. The more one looks
at the offensive General Giap has been
running since the autumn, and which
led to the attacks on the towns last
week, the more it looks as if its real
aim is not a military one at all. Its
aim is political: if possible, to shake
American public opinion into electing a
peace-making President in November;
failing that, to get negotiations going
on relatively favorable terms before
the Americans’ eats deeper
and deeper into the Communists’ hold
of the back-country. General Giap
might have preferred to hold his hand
until closer to November, but he is
obliged to strike now because the
weather will turn against him in the
spring. It is an attempt, conducted with
brilliant tactical dash, to force a settle-
ment before it is too late.
Three years ago, before the Ameri-
cans sent their army in, these attacks
on South Vietnam’s cities would have
been the last stage of the guerillas’ war:
having mastered the countryside, they
would have been mopping up the
towns according to Mao’s schedule.
Unless everybody has been wrong about
Vietnam, they are not capable of this
now. The Americans have been made
to look foolish by losing control of
part of their own embassy in Saigon.
They will be in serious trouble if they
and their allies cannot root the Viet
Cong squads out of all the cities
attacked last week. But it is very dif-
ficult for little bands of men with
small arms to hold out in street-fight-
ing against a determined regular army.
The last people who tried holding a
city against armored troops were the
Hungarians in 1956, and remember
what happened to them. And if the
allies do regain control, last week’s
attacks will look in retrospect like a
pretty desperate adventure. The
casualty count —it was 5000 Viet Cong
against 1000 allied dead after a week,
though the figures may conceal a lot
of civilian casualties—was bound to go
against the attackers: that is what hap-
pens when you throw yourselves at
the enemy’s strongpoints. The prob-
ability is that it will also end up as
a propaganda defeat for the Viet Cong.
Certainly the Viet Cong could not be
stopped from getting into the cities.
That will impress the nervous. But in
doing so the suicide squads have caused
a lot of civilian deaths. This time it
is the Viet Cong’s victims in the horror-
pictures: that should help to restore
the balance of emotion about this
war.
For a time, at mid-week, a lot of
people thought that this was the big
attack and that the communist build-
up around Khe Sanh in the north-
west corner of the country was a diver-
sion to pull American troops away. It
is almost certainly the other way round.
It is at Khe Sanh that General Giap is
looking for a victory that will achieve
his political purpose; the raids on the
cities are a diversion to draw the


Americans’ attention away from the
testing place.
The campaign that General Giap
launched at the end of last summer has
followed a perfectly clear pattern. First
he made an artillery attack on the
Marines’ base at Con Thien, near the
demilitarised zone in the far north. The
Americans duly sent reinforcements
scurrying up from farther south. He
then launched his North Vietnamese
and Viet Cong infantry, from jumping-
off points in Camodia and Laos, into a
series of attacks starting in the south
and moving steadily northward: at Loc
Ninh, Dak To, and now Khe Sanh. The
fact that each new attack has taken
place to the north of the previous one
is a tribute to the effect of the Ameri-
cans’ bombing of his supply lines. It
takes him about eight weeks, under this
hammering from the air, to assemble a
force big enough for a major fight. If
President Johnson had called off the
bombing, General Giap could have put
in more attacks, at quicker intervals,
and he could have darted from point
to point much more nimbly. At Khe
Sanh he is now at the stump-end of his
supply lines. The battle that is pre-
sumably going to take place at Khe
Sanh this month may be his last chance
of taking the offensive before the mon-
soon clears away from this part of Viet-
nam in April; and when the monsoon
goes the sky will be wide open to the
Americans’ airpower.
This was the setting of last week’s
attacks on the cities. The decision to
set the whole campaign under way was
presumably taken in the middle of last
summer, when the American public-
opinion polls began to show a sharp
decline in the Americans’ popular sup-
port for the war. The communist
attacks at Loc Ninh and Dak To were
bloody failures, and in December the
polls seemed to show that the Ameri-
cans were recovering their self-
confidence. It is all the more important
for North Vietnam that the Khe Sanh
attack should succeed. This must be
why President Ho Chi Minh took the
enormous risk of giving the Viet Cong
the order to go for the cities. It is some-
thing he never dared to do before, even
in the chaotic months of 1965 and early
1966 when the Saigon Government was
rocking on its feet and the Americans
had just started coming ashore to help
it out. If he is taking the risk now it
is because he feels he must.
The confrontation now taking place
could well be decisive. President Ho
and General Giap know the score. So
far this winter they have lost the big-
unit battles. The Communists have
taken far heavier casualties than the
Americans have; American opinion at
home has hardened in support of the
war. Nor has the decision to draw the
Americans into a series of big battles
stopped the allies from slowly whittling
down the area the Viet Cong controls.
The statistics are moving against the
Communists where it matters: in the
number of people under each side’s
governance; in the miles of roads
relatively secure from attack; in the
casualty ratios. They are moving
slowly, but they are moving. And North
Vietnam’s leaders know that after the
Presidential election there will be very
little they can do to recapture the
advantage.
The next President, if he is still com-
mitted to the war, will have three years
in which he can ram the allies’ military
superiority home virtually at will. The
Russians and the Chinese have made
their position pretty plain. One or both
of them might intervene if North Viet-
nam were invaded, though even that
is far from certain. But short of that
they are leaving it to the North Viet-
namese. If the Vietnamese Communists
accept the failure of their attempt to
put their sort of government into power
in Saigon, Russia and China will accept
it, too.
So unless General Giap’s regulars and
the Viet Cong irregulars do something
about it now, they will be on a long,
unstoppable slide downhill. And “now”
means by April, when the planes will
once more have an uninterrupted view
through the clouds in the northern part
of the country, which is the part
General Giap can still get at. It has
always been obvious that this war will
have to end in a political settlement.
Neither side wants, or has the power, to
kill or capture the entire enemy army.
The question is whether it will be a
settlement that makes South Vietnam
into a communist-run country or leaves
it to develop under a pluralist system.
It is a decision that will send its effects
rippling through the rest of southern
Asia. The big push that has now begun
—General Giap’s right-hook at Khe
Sanh, coupled with the Viet Cong’s
demonstration in the towns —is intended
to hustle Mr. Johnson into accepting
the sort of negotiations that will eventu-
ally leave South Vietnam to the Com-
munists; or, if Mr. Johnson won’t, to
frighten the Americans into electing
someone else who will. It is up to the
soldiers. If the allies cannot reassert
their control over Saigon and the other
big towns, the Americans will have to
negotiate their way on to the troop-
ships. But if they hold the towns and
stop Giap at Khe Sanh, they will have
won the upper hand in the war and in
the peace talks.
The War—2
VCs call the shots
By FRANK MARKLAND in Saigon.
SAIGON IS FULL of the usual odd
contrasts when the stubborn needs of
everyday life are challenged by crisis.
The women go out to buy what little
they can at prices two and three times
the normal. The housewives’ gossip is
of hoarding shopkeepers and prices
A VC slain in the onslaught on Saigon
is dragged away unceremoniously
that will stay high even after the trouble
is over. The small boys in the street
are playing “combat” outside the win-
dow with the super toy weapons they
were given for the Tet New Year holi-
day. Television keeps the street quiet
for two hours in the evening, with
uncles and aunts and cousins from the
battle zones as enthralled as everyone
else.
The other face of Saigon today is the
Vietnamese Catholic priests driving in
jeeps with heavily armed bodyguards.
Four Viet Cong prisoners looking like
high-school boys pick up Viet Cong
corpses under a police guard.
The corpses, with their violent
wounds, look as unreal as Tussaud’s
horror dummies and their hair is stiff
and matted like a dirty wig. American
soldiers armed to the teeth and pro-
tected by fat flak jackets speed
dramatically by, guns sticking out like
oars from their cars.
A 22-year-old Viet Cong, who sur-
rendered, tells how he joined the Lib-
eration Front only a month ago and
was sent into battle with one grenade,
which he never used. An Army officer
grins and holds the homemade weapon
up for people to see.
The use of American helicopters and
Vietnamese Air Force Skyraiders in the
city fighting seems to have produced
questionable results. Some 100 square
yards of jam-packed houses behind the
An Quang Pagoda were reduced to
charred rubble on Saturday afternoon.
Luckily, most of the inhabitants had
moved out after earlier fire-fights in the
area, because, in this case, the Govern-
ment apparently gave no warning of the
coming air attack. But few, if any,
Viet Cong seem to have been killed
either.
Helicopter gunships may have caused
most of the civilian casualties, accord-
ing to Vietnamese who have fled battle
areas. The Provisional Government
figure of over 1000 civilians wounded


Johnson on Thursday urging Americans
to prayers “for strength of purpose”
and 100 killed in Saigon seems low.
A check of only two hospitals on the
first afternoon of the fighting showed
some 300 wounded.
The refugee problem is also bad,
though a good many will drift home
in the next few days. One Catholic
church and school in the Gia Dinh
suburb has taken in 4000 refugees since
Wednesday.
But most have probably found refuge
with friends or relations, and, on Satur-
day, with the curfew lifted till 1 p.m.,
the streets were full of people with
their bundles, manoeuvring like ants
past tanks, police checks, and road-
blocks.
Reports from the rest of the country
are still too hazy to allow a judgment
on the extent of the damage done by
the Viet Cong attacks. But the destruc-
tion in several places seems likely to be
severe. The American Command claims
some 15,000 Viet Cong have been killed,
giving the Government forces a 13-to-
one “kill ratio.” This represents a Viet
Cong loss in a week of fighting the
equivalent to the American estimate of
their average losses over two months.
Although it is impossible to disprove
this American figure, it is certainly not
necessary, in the circumstances, to take
it as gospel truth.
It will be a different war after this
week, and the odds are that it will be
a bigger, more bad-tempered, and much
more dangerous war. Everything now
depends on how the three major ele-
ments on the non-communist side —the
Americans, the Saigon Government, and
the South Vietnamese people react
under the shock of the Viet Cong
offensive.
The most immediate reaction can be
expected from the American machine
in Saigon, if only to relive the painful
situation it has now tumbled into. For
the fact is that the senior American
officials in Saigon * and, above all,
General Westmoreland, have made a
bad shock worse by recent optimistic
reports on the war’s progress.
It is perfectly clear that the American
military command had no idea of the
scope of the coming Viet Cong attack,
which their estimate of the enemy’s
strength and capability seemed to rule
out, and, although U.S. commanders
say they were aware of unusual Viet
Cong troop movements in January,
they failed to intercept the forces that
have now attacked over half the coun-
try’s provincial capitals, Saigon, and
major military installations.
At the same time, the degree to
which the Viet Cong have held the
military initiative since the start of
their dry-season campaign last October
has now been rubbed home with a
vengeance. In this period almost all the
big battles have been fought when and
where the Viet Cong wanted.
American troops have had to be de-
ployed to meet these threats, most not-
ably to the country’s two northern-
most provinces, where an unprecedented
concentration of over 6000 U.S.
Marines and soldiers are waiting for an
attack at Khe Sanh.
Lieutenant-General Wyand, Com-
mander of American Forces in the area
round Saigon, said the “basic purpose
of the Viet Cong attack on the capital
was political and psychological.” He
also admitted that the Viet Cong may
not be interested in the American judg-
ment that they have suffered their
“greatest military defeat” in terms of
losses.
Nonetheless, the most likely Ameri-
can military response here is to demand
more men, and less restriction on their
use, in order to achieve higher enemy
losses, for this is basically what the
American military machine has been
constructed to do.
There is little chance that Ambas-
sador Ellsworth Bunker and the civilians
under him could force any rethinking
on this aproach to the war at this time,
and it is doubtful whether they even
want to.
The two Vietnamese elements in the
present situation are in danger of being
ignored. Symptomatic of this was the
way in which on Wednesday American
officials were treating the Viet Cong
attack on the Embassy as the most
serious event of a day when the Viet
Cong were on the rampage throughout
the length of the country.
In fact, the Vietnamese Government
is now under serious strains. First it
has been hit by yet another crisis of
confidence about American intentions.
Ambassador Bunker was forced to deny
rumors spread, according to him by
the Viet Cong Liberation Radio, that
America was co-operating with the Viet
Cong to destroy the Thieu Government
and replace it by a coalition.
However, incredible though it may
seem, these rumors were current in
Saigon political and military circles on
Thursday, apparently independent of
any communist broadcast.
Second, the crisis could soon un-
settle the uneasy balance of interests
between the Generals, who are the
real decision-makers at a moment like
this.
In these circumstances, the future of
the whole brand-new constitutional set-
up, laboriously constructed over the
past 18 months, looks uncertain.
Even if this sort of trouble is avoided,
the Thieu Government has suffered a
severe reverse in its task of winning
the active support of the Vietnamese
people. This is of vital importance, be-
cause the people are the prize the Viet
Cong also are trying to buy with their
soldiers’ blood.
In these circumstances, the Govern-
ment’s job in winning back some
measure of confidence and support in
Saigon, let alone the rest of the coun-
try, is going to be long and tough.
The Wa r-3
Playing it cool
By ANTHONY HOWARD in Washington.
THE JOHNSON Administration is re-
acting to the dramatically changed mili-
tary situation in Vietnam with just the
same caution and care that it displayed
last week in its handling of the Pueblo
crisis.
Instead of making any direct military
response to the communist offensive, it
has launched a domestic propaganda
drive designed to reassure public
opinion. This is a necessary operation—
popular morale on the war has never
been at a lower ebb. But what has
caused surprise is that the President
has made no effort to capitalise on the
widespread sense of shock and outrage
—by, for example, seizing the oppor-
tunity to order a further mobilisation
of reserves. Instead, he has seemed to
be doing his best to confine and contain
public indignation.
Even East-European diplomats, while
openly derisive of the President’s
“Pollyanna” approach at his Press con-
ference on Friday, admit to being im-
pressed by Mr. Johnson’s reluctance to
inflame public opinion. Among both
western and communist diplomatic
sources here there is, in fact, a surpris-
ing unanimity of view that peace talks
may be a great deal nearer than anyone
looking at the immediate military situa-
tion could possibly suspect.
One East-European ambassador, who
predicts the first round of negotiations
by June or July, is certain that the
President has recognised at last that not
all the promises the military made to
him can be fulfilled. This diplomat
candidly admits that he originally ex-
pected the moment of truth to come
much later, but now that it has arrived
he is certain that it explains the ex-
ceptionally restrained attitude of Mr.
Johnson to the successive psychological
blows that U.S. has suffered, first in
Korea and now in Vietnam.
The President, at his suddenly sum-


moned meeting with reporters in the
Cabinet Room of the White House on
Friday, announced none of the reprisals
or retaliations against North Vietnam
that had been widely discussed and
anticipated.
Instead, he coupled a sombre warn-
ing about the threat to American troops
at Khe Sanh with a cool assertion that
all the Viet Cong’s attacks in Saigon
and other provincial cities had been
a “complete failure.”
In making this latter point the Presi-
dent fully endorsed the essentially de-
fensive position taken up by General
William Westmoreland in Saigon. The
General has maintianed ever since the
first Viet Cong assault on the American
Embassy that the enemy’s best-laid
plans went astray and that the Viet
Cong is not only “going for broke” but
also “running out of steam.”
For the time being, the President’s
public underwriting of the General’s
stand seems to have disposed of the
heavy question-mark that even Govern-
ment officials had hinted was hanging
over General Westmoreland’s survival
in his present command. It did not,
however, pass entirely without notice
that for the first time Mr. Johnson con-
ceded that both General Westmoreland
as a military commander and he him-
self as the Commander-in-Chief might
have made “some serious mistakes.”
A great deal of irritation exists else-
where in the Government with General
Westmoreland’s apparent conviction
that everything can still be justified in
terms of tally of enemy dead—a tally
that is regarded with widespread scep-
ticism, anyway.
There is another snag about the
optimistic gloss that the Administration
is trying to put on recent events. What
the Viet Cong has done once it can
presumably do again. If the South Viet-
namese nation is plunged two or three
times more into anarchy by lightning
enemy strikes not in the countryside but
rather in the heart of what was sup-
posed to be Government-controlled
areas, then the much-advertised U.S.
experiment in nation-building will begin
to look rather unsuccessful.
It is plainly this more than anything
else that is now alarming at least the
political elements within the Johnson
Administration.
The President’s own electoral assess-
ment has always been that on Vietnam
he has nothing to fear from an attack
directed at him from the right. The
principal reason why he has always
been terrified of a Rockfeller Republi-
can candidature has lain in his nagging
suspicion that somehow Rockefeller
might put himself up as the sensible
moderate and present LBJ as the
“hawk.”
Now, however, a new threat has
emerged to the President’s re-election
prospects —and potentially it could be
a serious one. Conceivably the first
veiled hint of it came last week from
Mr. Richard Nixon, who, in announcing
his candidature for the Republican
nomination, went out of his way to
make it clear that his support of
national policy in the present crisis did
not imply that he was happy about the
limited use that President Johnson had
made of “America’s vast military and
economic power” in Vietnam.
It is Mr. Johnson’s misfortune that
in the ten shattering days since the
Pueblo incident he should suddenly
appear to many bewildered and resent-
ful Americans as an ineffective steward
of the nation’s proud heritage. Yet the
very restraint and responsibility with
which he has so far reacted to both
crises have rendered him suddenly vul-
nerable to precisely the kind of political
attack from which he always used to
seem secure.
Singapore-Malaysia
Towards neutrality?
By HARVEY STOCKWIN in Singapore
AS MR. HASLUCK (see page 17)
set out to visit the area from which
the British rug was being abruptly
pulled away, it is possible that the red
carpet would have been put out for
him with more eagerness in Singapore-
Malaysia if an enthusiastic “how-soon-
shall-we-get-around-the-table” response
had come from Canberra to proposals
for a Five-Power, Singapore-Malaysia-
Britain-ANZAC Conference.
Nevertheless, Mr. Hasluck’s visit will
undoubtedly be a useful means for
gauging the uncertainties. It has been
generally welcomed as a clear indication
of increased Australian concern.
It should be indisputable that it is
too soon for any hard and fast con-
clusions to be drawn, and that the
accelerated withdrawal still gives time
for prior consideration of what needs
doing rather than decisions about what
should be done. Nonetheless, one pos-
sible means has emerged as a distinct
likelihood in advance of prolonged
analysis of ends. This is that, given the
winding up of the Commonwealth
Brigade at Terendak, a compact Aus-
tralian presence could be created in
and around Butterworth. The RAAF
base could be sustained (?) given the
replacement of the 800 RAF personnel
presently servicing it. Further it is
speculated the Australian Battalion now
situated at Malacca could be based, in-
stead, nearby.
Such a “presence” might well fit in
with what Malaysia’s Tunku Abdul
Rahman had in mind when he spoke
last week in the Malaysian Parliament
about Malaysia’s “old Allies” continu-
ing to provide Malaysia with “a certain
amount of strength” to make Malaysia
“more dependable for any agreement”
that might be made “with other coun-
tries on matters of defence or on mat-
ters of neutrality or non-aggression.”
This reference came about specifically
as a result of a striking Parliamentary
speech by the Melbourne-educated ex-
Minister of Home Affairs Tun Dr.
Ismail, speaking from the backbenches
for the first time since his retirement.
Tun Dr. Ismail, stressing that he spoke
for himself and not his ex-Cabinet col-
leagues, proposed that the countries of
the region should collectively declare
“the neutralisation of South-East Asia,”
which to be effective “must be guaran-
teed by the big powers, including Com-
munist China.” He then suggested the
signing of non-aggression pacts and dec-
larations of peaceful co-existence be-
tween and among all South-East Asian
States.
Tun Ismail significantly said he made
this proposal “in case the Five-Power
Conference either fails to materialise
or, if it meets, fails to bear satisfactory
fruits.” Very likely he had in mind
the lukewarm Anglo-ANZAC response
to the Tunku’s proposal for a Five-
Power Conference. In any event, he
said that soundings in . regard to
neutralisation, non-aggression, and co-
existence should take place “before pro-
ceeding with the Five-Power Confer-
ence.”
Naturally, the T'unku, seeing that the
old alliance could be “complementary”
to any new arrangements, did not accept
such re-allocation of priorities. Equally,
seeing also the need to “look further
ahead” and not to just “confine our-
selves” to Anglo-ANZAC-Malaysia-
Singapore arrangements, the Tunku
accepted the possibility that “the right
approach at the right moment” might
help persuade other countries “to agree
to non-aggression pacts and agree to
the neutralisation of this area of South-
East Asia.” He stipulated, however, that
such a solution “is difficult to achieve
without working hard and conscien-
tiously for it.”
On the one hand, therefore, the
Tunku opened up a new range of pos-
sibilities by stressing flexibilities in
Malaysian foreign policy to a much
greater extent than hitherto. On the
other, shrewd politician that he is, he
displayed no intention of allowing co-
existence, non-aggression, and neutralisa-
tion hopes to be subordinated to hard
defence facts and power realities.
Ironically Indonesia may have
assumed the un-neutral stance Sukarno
once attacked Malaysia for having.
Passing through Singapore prior to the
Tunku’s speech, but after Tun Ismail’s
proposals, Brigadier General Sudjono
Humardami, a personal assistant and
special envoy for Suharto, was reported
as stressing that Indonesia was com-
mitted to anti-Communism since “we
have had various experiences with them
so that we believe Communism cannot
co-exist (with) any isms.”
Thus Mr. Hasluck has flown to a
situation in which old attitudes are
reversing even as the options are
changing. Indonesia is now the most
domestically preoccupied of the three
countries he is visiting, while Malaysia,
once too introverted, is widening its
view.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Its not all gilt for the
balance of payments
THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
performed remarkably well in the
December quarter last year, but most
of the gilt is taken off the gingerbread
by the big writedown of overseas
reserves (the sterling segment) con-
sequent on the devaluation of the pound
in Australian dollar terms. (Although
the latter had to be, of course, nobody
is saying that the purchasing power of
our sterling reserves has dropped by
anything like the full percentage of that
adjustment.) Net apparent capital
inflow for the December quarter was
$250 million, or $l3l million more than
in the corresponding period in 1966. If
a lot of this was funk money entering
prior to devaluation, there’s every indi-
cation that most of it is here to stay.
We also did much better on the current
account balance, albeit still being in
heavy deficit actually $lBO million
as against $259 million the previous
quarter. The improvement there was
owed thanks to an export surplus on
visible trade of $37 million, compared
with a deficit of $72 million in the
September quarter.
A salutary drop in imports in the
month of December to $232 million,
from $258.5 million and $275.6 million
in the two previous months (all on a
seasonally adjusted basis), was a very
helpful factor in getting this visible
trade balance. But with defence imports
now a highly volatile influence on the
monthly imports figures, it should be
interpreted cautiously.
In the upshot there was a fall of
$43 million to $llOO million (by
$93 million since June 30) in overseas
reserves after deducting the $ll3 mil-
lion reduction in the sterling compon-
ent including the N.Z. component,
consequent on the devaluations. With-
out that deduction reserves would have
risen by $7O million in the quarter.
Clearly, without any firm assuran-
ces that the imports bill isn't going to
rise strongly again (the January
figures are due this week) and with a
big question mark over capital inflow,
exports assume a greater importance
than ever. Not that they’ve been let-
ting the side down, of course. So far
in 1967-68 they have been consistently
above last year’s level, and ended the
six months to December $73 million
higher at $1479 million.
Happily, exports of iron ore are now
making their presence felt in a big
way and largely account for a jump
from $70.1 to $113.5 million in what
are plassified as metalliferous ores in
the s,ix-month period. This sum should
be stepped up considerably; obviously it
is just as well, because neither exports
of cereal grains (mainly wheat), up
from $154 million to $247 million in
the last six months, nor textile fibres
(mainly wool), which were down from
$390 million to $339 million in the
period, look like weighing in nearly to
the same effect in 1968.
Wool
No firm case for
"management"
THE AUSTRALIAN WOOL
BOARD’S proposals for reviving its re-
serve price scheme received two severe
blows last week. The one which got
most publicity was the International
Wool Textiles Organisation’s strong
attack on the idea. But in the long
haul, a more significant blow has been
struck by the Bureau of Agricultural
Economics. In a detailed study of the
price elasticity of the demand for wool
it comes up with a set of conclusions
which seriously undermine the case
for “management” of the supply of
wool, as proposed by the Board. The
board’s case for such management rests
on the theory that if prices of wool are
kept up there will be no significant re-
duction in sales.
A sixty-page report on research done
in the Bureau concludes, among other
things, that this is incorrect. The price
elasticity of demand for Australian
wool is estimated to be “in the vicinity
of unity,” which, translated out of
economic jargon, means that a given
rise in the price for Australian wool
would cause a fall in the amount
bought of an equivalent percentage,
leaving the gross returns unchanged.
The trend of elasticity, said the re-
port, has been steadily increasing over
the past 12 years, parallel with the
development of synthetic wool substi-
tutes. This suggests that increasingly
the demand for wool will drop by pro-
portionately more than any rise in price,
suggesting that efforts by a reserve price
authority to raise prices would be posi-
Wool’s Gunn . . . wishful thinking?
tively counter-productive. Rises in
prices would tend actually to reduce
gross returns to woolgrowers.
Another Wool Board theory has been
that demand elasticity is greater at
boom times than at dull times and that
an authority could increase overall re-
turns by successfully predicting price
trends—buying low and selling high.
The Bureau report says flatly that there
is no empirical support for this theory.
It finds no difference in elasticity,
which suggests that the Wool Board
theory is sheer wishful thinking.
Consumer spending
Retail sales aren't
really booming
THE COMMONWEALTH
TREASURY in its January Informa-
tion Bulletin claims that consumer
spending has been particularly buoyant
so far this year. If there is unusual
buoyancy it is in car sales. Up around
an annual rate of 430,000, they have
responded more strongly than the most
optimistic estimates of a year ago.
December quarter sales were up 15
percent above those of a year ago. The
new Holdens seem to have got a
good reception and this will probably
lift the whole market a little.
But, excluding cars, retail sales are
not going up at anything that can be
described as boom rates. The December
quarter saw the level of sales rise by
just on one percent on the September
quarter, which makes an annual rise of
only four percent. September had been
up on June 2.4 percent, but a good
proportion of that (two-thirds, prob-
ably) is accounted for by price
increases. None of this bodes particu-
larly well for the profitability of retail
stores this financial year.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy : The Federal Treasury’s new loan
offers a mild lift m interest rates for the short and medium
terms, their first advance for two years; long-term rates
are unaltered.
The December quarter produced a net apparent capital
inflow of $250 million, $l3l million more than the corres-
ponding 1966 period; visible trade showed a $37 million
surplus, to contrast with the September quarter’s $72 mil-
lion deficit, while the current account deficit totalled $lBO
million (September quarter $259 million).
The six months to December saw wool exports reach
$338 million, or $5l million below the 1966 six months;
Japan bought about 30 percent in the latest period.
For the murhets : Miners and oils once more tended
to dominate dealings on Australian share markets, aided by
London buying and good metal prices; industrials look a
little irregular.
Equities went well ahead in London finishing firm on
hopes of rising industrial output and higher exports . . .
Wall Street turned down after profit-taking and concern
about Asia.
For companies: With a kind of calm skill, Western
Mining Corporation revealed its plans to finance Kambalda
nickel’s $5O million expansion a premium share issue
to raise $45.15 million; after splitting the existing 50-cent
shares into 10-cent units, the offer will be l-for-4 at a price
of $3.20 (equivalent to $l6 a 50-cent share) payable in
instalments and involving rights trading. Kambalda’s reserves
continue to grow, standing just now at 9.3 million tons
averaging 3.8 percent nickel . . . Surface studies have
apparently disclosed a large nickel area at Wiluna (W.A.);
drilling is now to be carried out by Australia’s Vam in
partnership with the U.S. Delhi Petroleum . . . Silver
Valley Uranium is to become Silver Valley Minerals and
intends to develop its 60 percent interest in a Newcastle
property containing coal, gravel, clay, aggregates, build-
ing sand, and timber . . . Higher sales and profits are
coming to Associated Minerals, which has kept a steady 20
percent interim . . . Higher sales also, and “improved
efficiencies,” sent Comalco Industries’ earnings up by 82
percent to $10,853,120; the N.Z. smelter, with Japanese
participation, is to go ahead.
Financiers still look lively, with Commercial and General
Acceptance (CAGA) putting the first half’s profits up
by 13 percent to $1,142,750 on higher volume.
The December half saw transporter Brambles Industries
earn $177,348 more at $1,060,145 and pay the anticipated
6 percent on issue-increased capital . . . For the same
period, Dunlop Australia moved up by $1,137,711 to
$3,791,040, lifting the interim from 4 to 4|- percent.
Agricultural equipment maker Chamberlain Holdings
forecasts increased earnings for 1967-68 ... In the same
line, Ralph McKay showed profit gains in the face of
drought.
Melbourne brewer Carlton and United pushed first-
half profits up substantially, partly as a result of the Syd-
ney brewery strike . . . Cigarette maker Philip Morris
improved by 20 percent to $1,484,039 in its first half.
BHP’s subsidiary, Commonwealth Steel, will expand
stainless-steel sheet and strip capacity by a $lO million,
plant expansion.
MEN AND MATTERS
IN AUSTRALIA FOR a week to check
on the lead battery business of Asso-
ciated Battery Makers of Australia Ltd.
and give his blessing to the establish-
ment of alkaline battery production by
the new Alkaline Batteries Australia
Pty. Ltd. at Revesby (N.S.W.), Sir
Joseph Hunt took time off to tell of his
interests outside being executive director
of the parent Chloride Electric Storage
Co.
As he started work in a cotton mill
at the age of 12, and then with Chloride
as an office boy at 14, he has great
sympathy for all education and training
schemes. Fie is chairman of the
National Advisory Council for Educa-
tion in industry and commerce, which
takes care of all adult education. He
was on the board of governors of the
technical college in Birmingham, which,
three years ago, became the new tech-
nological university, Aston. Sir Joseph
became the pro-chancellor, sharing his
business experience for the benefit of
the academic world.
In Sir Joseph’s opinion, one of the
most important things to have happened
in U.K. industry is the Industrial Train-
ing Act. He is a member of the Central
Training Council, a governing body
advising the Minister on its operations.
As an apolitical industrialist, Sir
Joseph is chairman of the Hunt Com-
mittee for Intermediate Areas, looking
into economic planning. This uses the
carrot of inducements to invest in areas
that are not prosperous and the whip
of withholding licences to build factories
in congested or prosperous areas, so
attempting to achieve distribution of
economic growth and avoid the social
and economic costs of big cities.
His Chloride responsibilities are for
overseas operations, reorganisation, and
personnel. From his home in Redditch,
Sir Joseph does some watercolor paint-
ing, and is interested in pre-history,
archaeology, and music.
THIS WOULD BE a bad time to be
getting a first ducking in the turbulent
waters of Australian industrial relations,
and it is just as well for us, as for him,
that Dr. P. Halford Cook, 55-year-old
Melburnian (Wesley and Queens),
who recently took over from Sir Henry
Bland as secretary of the Department
of Labor and National Service, has been
coxing about on them these many years.
He’s not only been first secretary of
this particular branch (there are two
others) for the past five years, but has
frequently stood in for Sir Henry in
the top post. Nonetheless, Cook sees the
new job as a great challenge for him-
self and also his professional psycholo-
gical approach, something he has
developed as well by hard experience
in the field as through university work
in several countries and fellowships of
the Australian and British Psychological
Societies.
The doctorate is of philosophy, of
Sir Joseph Hunt
Dr. P. H. Cook
course, and was awarded in psychology
by the University of Kansas (U.S.) as
the climax to postgraduate work in the
subject at Melbourne (where he was a
part-time lecturer and started the first
course in industrial administration after
earlier getting his M.A.), Columbia and
London, where, as well as studying at
the university, he worked at the
Tavistock Institute of Human Rela-
tions.
In climbing its ladder in the past 25
years Dr. Cook further tightened his
disciplines, but has also found a lot of
time for outside work at Prince Henry’s
Hospital in an honorary consultant’s
role, for mountain-climbing and hiking
generally, and for writing (two of his
works are “Productivity Team Tech-
niques,” 1951, and, earlier, “Theory
and Technique of Child Guidance”).


THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
Ask the proper
questions
please, Mr. Gorton
BY J. C. HORSFALL
MR. GORTON has yet to show
his full hand in economic affairs. But
going on his Brisbane performance, the
new PM, who studied economics at
Oxford in the depressed early 1930 s
and has since cut out a good living
from farming, is not exactly a babe in
the economic woods. Reading between
his Brisbane lines one got the distinct
feeling that he’s going to demand
heavier ounces of value from Govern-
ment spending than his predecessor got,
also that he’s going to weigh more
exactingly what the country can afford
to spend on the respective spheres of
defence and development.
We got a clear hint of his approach
to spending in general from his intima-
tion that he was looking at social ser-
vices expenditure with an eye to in-
creasing its effectiveness within the cur-
rent limits of the outlay. Although this
is something one had hoped the Gov-
ernment regarded as a continuing exer-
cise, conducted along strict economic
lines, the same old pattern of social
services payments has been virtually
unchanged for years, with the
dichotomy between payments to the less
needy and the more needy being hope-
lessly blurred resulting in consider-
able waste simply because the Govern-
ment has so long turned its deaf ear
to suggestions to streamline the prin-
ciples behind the social-services budget.
While the new PM is about it, he
should extend his observations on social-
services spending to the whole range
of Government expenditure, which has
grown in Alice in Wonderland fashion
and speed in recent years, most of it
on an ad hoc basis to the virtual neglect
of any clearly defined principles and
national priorities, let alone cost/bene-
fit analyses. Just to mention one angle
Gorton might care to look at on this,
it is high time a thorough examination
was made of the wide area available for
economies in Government expenditure
over the country as a whole.
Obviously a stricter measuring rod
will also have to be put over the twin
claims of defence and development.
It is pretty clear that, despite Gorton’s
intimation that the cost of the Aus-
tralian commitment in Vietnam would
have to be contained around its present
level, it is equally clear that overall
the Australian defence effort in South-
East Asia is going to increase substan-
tially in the light of the British with-
drawal from the area. Mr. Gorton may
well find that something the rate
of development, perhaps will have
to give to get more defence. In any
case, now would be the right time
for the Government to redefine its
attitude to the defence-versus-develop-
ment question, a matter which Mr.
Holt always preferred to leave hanging
in the wind and which Mr. McMahon,
in his strange action (strange in face
of the predictable increase in defence
outlay) in opting more resources for the
private sector in his last Budget, never
appears to have got firmly to grips with.
It now becomes one of the most urgent
issues, not only because of the British
withdrawal but also because of the
strong likelihood of less overseas capital
and reserves being available to us in
the next two years as a result of recent
U.S. and British decisions. It is sense-
less for the PM or anybody else to go
on thumping out a rousing development
beat if, through lack of an adequate
defence effort, our whole set-up is
imperilled.
So far as overseas capital goes, the
real point now is that a high proportion
of it likely to come here in the next
two years will go into minerals develop-
ment nickel, iron ore, oil mainly
and overseas-owned enterprises operat-
ing here. This will put considerable
strain on local capital supplies for
the maintenance of development in
the general industrial sector of the
economy, on which the absorption of
a high intake of immigrants largely
depends. This puts the issue of defence
versus development into sharp focus
for the Government. It calls for a re-
appraisal of the Holt Ministry’s assump-
tion that ample resources were available
for the absorption of as many immi-
grants as it could persuade to come here
and that they could be accommodated
without any sacrifice to the local
standard of living and price stability.
As a matter of fact, the validity of the
assumption looks to have been seriously
questioned by the upward (four per-
cent) movement in consumer prices
in the past year, nothwithstanding their
lower rate of rise in the recent
December quarter.
What’s been happening, of course, is
that through liberal credit policies in
the past year or so, when the break
from price stability has become more
pronounced, we’ve been trying to stretch
our available capital supplies by a pro-
cess economists such as Sir Dennis
Robertson used to call forced saving
(speaking broadly, this is simply squeez-
ing the public, by allowing prices to rise
more, into providing more capital for
the economy than they would save under
conditions of price stability). Mr. Gor-
ton, even in selecting his Treasurer,
should take a good look at the possible
effects of continuing to run the coun-
try’s finances along these abandoned
lines, whether, in fact, in the long run
both development and the provision of
resources for defence would not better
be served by a return to more orthodox
policies.
At any rate, a continuation of the
McMahon line, acceptable though it
would be to business in that it cuts all
the corners in its efforts to keep effec-
tive demand topped up and economic
activity bowling along under its spur,
would mean that Gorton, like Holt, was
prepared to live dangerously so long as
the momentum behind development is
maintained. Nobody has any qualms
about conducting economic affairs in
this spirit of careless rapture in,
say, South American republics, but
here we’ve built a fine reputation
for promoting fairly vigorous growth
in conditions of moderate price
stability, and this is one of the main
reasons (coupled with stable political
conditions and a wealth of natural re-
sources) that we’ve managed to attract
so much overseas capital. At the very
least I would expect Gorton, who has
been dubbed in some quarters as being
rather on the reactionary side and,
above ail, tough, will, as an Oxford
economist, ask the right questions about
where this policy could take us.
This is not to say that business-
should expect an early reversal of Mr.
McMahon’s financial policies. For one
thing Gorton is the new boy with only
passing acquaintance with the mysteries,
of the Treasury, where, since Sir
Roland Wilson went, McMahon would
seem to have bent the secretary to his
will, rather than the other way round,
and, for that matter, even got Dr.
Coombs to sing in his credit bath
(bankers, please pass the soapl). How-
ever, by next August, when we’ll have
another Budget, I would expect quite
a change in the Government’s approach
to the country’s finances, with the heat
having been taken off the credit pumps
and the Treasurer’s hand on the taxa-
tion tiller—something Mr. McMahon in
his unavailing attempt to please every-
body in the past two years has hardly
dared to touch, even in the interests of
getting the now huge sums required for
defence (they are not so tender of the
taxpayer’s feelings when it comes to
defence taxes in Israel or the U.S.).
One wouldn’t expect Gorton to have
McMahon’s inhibitions about increasing
taxation, though this would be because
he would take a more rigorous fiscal
rather than an economic approach,
especially in the interests of pre-empting
resources for defence. If industry would
probably prefer the method of forced
saving, it is unlikely to go empty-handed
from a PM who has been looking after
CSIRO affairs in recent times. The last
time I saw Gorton on a platform, he
was lauding the results of CSIRO’s
research efforts to a group of Victorian
farmers. Wouldn’t it be nice if, for all
his expected efforts to prune Govern-
ment expenditure, he offered research
money to industry on a dollar-for-dollar
basis? That would really be a step for-
ward.


Are Your Investments Growing?
Has your portfolio performance been held back by the drift in Coles,
Henry Jones, David Jones, W. R. Carpenter, Woolworths & other “Leaders”
- instead of gaining ground with 8.H.P., Western Mining & PekoP
The Good Solid Stocks:
Of course W. R. Carpenter, Waltons, Queensland Press,
National Consolidated, and Coles are “good sound stocks”. So
are many others which have declined persistently in the market
in recent years. Somebody has to own them. So, when our port-
folio clients sold out, other people bought them. And some nave
held them all the way down. Somebody had to be the bunny. In
the investment business, there are far more bunnies than foxes.
The New Growth Stocks:
After selling the now senile “growth companies” to the bun-
nies. the foxes have been having a royal time with the growth
stocks of today. They have been making money with the new
dynamic market leaders Thiess, Peko, Western Mining,
8.H.P., C.R.A., King Island, and their fellows. The days when
the best investment policy was to “buy good sound stocks and
lock them away” are gone forever both in Australia and
overseas. To be sure, if one buys a selection of such stocks, and
lives long enough, there is a good chance that his portfolio will
keep pace on average with the cost of living. But is “on average”
good enough?
What is the advantage of investing for half a lifetime, only
to find that when the critical time comes, the portfolio is worth
far less than it should be. It is jioor consolation to find that
many of the “good sound companies” have been falling in the
market, while the growth stocks of today are held by somebody
else. By the’time a growth stock is recognised by everybody,
there is a good chance that its period of dynamic growth is
drawing to a close.
Today’s Growth Stocks:
The outstanding rises in stocks like Western Mining, Mary
Kathleen, Thiess, Peko, and King Island have priced many of
them far higher in the market (in relation to present or pros-
pective earnings) than are the world mining leaders such as
Climax and Anaconda in the U.S.A. market.
Can they keep going up? No, they cannot. Sooner or later
they will top out, and decline. They will join the band of
“mature growth stocks” and will yield pride of place to the new
dynamic growth stocks of the seventies.
If you want your portfolio to grow in value, you must buy
into today’s growth stocks, and get out of them when they
become yesterday’s.
Recognising Growth Stocks:
Trendex portfolio management employs both company per-
formance and market action analysis as guides. Last week you
read the news that “Bass Strait’s turbulent waters ... cover an
oil-field of proportions equally as heroic as anything the Middle
East has to offer”.
In our report to portfolio clients in August, 1966, we stated:
“Few fields in the world have the combination of thickness of
oil sand, porosity, and permeability, which has been demon-
strated by the off-shore testing to date in Gippsland . . . B.H.P.
has struck the jackpot in Gippsland with its first play . . . this
is a turning point in B.H.P. history”.
Because of this, and because Trendex principles showed that
a big price rise was coming, Trendex advised buying.
In selecting B.H.P. for clients in 1966 between $5 and $6,
Trendex was reversing a former policy, because clients had been
taken out of B.H.P. five years earlier in 1961, before the stock
declined from $7 to wallow in the doldrums for years around $6.
Why Prices Stop Rising:
A stock like Western Mining rises in price because demand is
unsatisfied. After a stock is becoming “recognised” and “res-
pectable” (and particularly while rising in price) more people
seek to buy it. Buying Power exceeds Selling Pressure. Even-
tually, practically everybody who wants the stock, and is in a
position to buy, has had his fill, and Buying Power dwindles.
When it has weakened sufficiently, very little Selling Pressure
is needed to cause a stock to topple. And any show of price
weakness begets Selling Pressure. If Selling Pressure exceeds
Buying Power by a clear margin, price fall can be rapid. The
decline accelerates Selling Pressure and the effect is cumulative.
Traders who bought to sell at a higher price, quickly bail out. It
is the conventional portfolio holder who stands the brunt of the
loss. When the turn comes in 8.H.P., and Western Mining, the
average portfolio holder will grit his teeth and hang on just
as he has done for years with the Coles and the Jones (Henry
and David).
Growth Companies and Growth Stocks:
Trendex portfolio management clients have an advantage
here. They know that every stock has its day, and that sooner
or later every one of them tops out after a good rise. They also
know that a stock is worth only what it sells for in the market.
They know that companies like David Jones, John Mcllwraith,
Marrickville, Carpenter, Coles, Woolworths and Waltons are
sound enterprises. They know that at least some of them are
progressive and expanding industries of the highest order. But
they also know that a sound, progressive, and expanding com-
pany is not necessarily a growth stock in the market. That is
why Trendex clients have avoided such stocks during their
declines of recent years.

How to beat the suburban sprawl
By BRIAN HOAD
AUSTRALIA’S FIRST blocks of liv-
ing units were launched 'upon a sus-
picious and hostile public some 20
years ago. Many stood empty, and some
developers lost heavily on an idea that
was premature. For another 13 years
passed before the “one-man-one-house-
one-garden” philosophy of the Aus-
tralian way of life, through the Strata
Title Act of 1961, allowed units to be
built and sold in any quantity,
and today there appears to be more
than enough of them. Or are there?
Melbourne liberally scatters its
2,121,900 citizens over an area of 812
square miles; Sydney, with a couple of
hundred thousand more people to cater
for, has laid claim to a more modest
671 square miles. Sparing a thought for
7,948,800 Londoners packed into 620
square miles, or 8,125,000 New Yorkers
piled one upon another in a mere 314
square miles, it becomes understandable
why Australia has acquired a certain
international fame for being the most
suburban place on earth; an endless
desert, goes the rumor, of red earth and
red roofs.
But in Sydney there has risen a 430 ft.
monument to the revolutionary idea
that Australians are at last becoming
ready to step into the modern age of
expanding populations and high-density
living, and move back into their cities;
that 100 miles and more of commuting
each day is beginning to be thought of
as excessive; that, in Sydney at least,
the rush-hour journey from even the
inner suburbs has become too crowded,
too uncomfortable, too lengthy and
frustrating a business for those who can
afford otherwise.
The site on which this monument
has arisen stood vacant for years at
the corner of Castlereagh and Park
Streets in an area where, it was reputed,
office space could fetch at best an
annual rental of $3 per sq. ft., while
$6 per sq. ft. was said to be the price
needed to make the building of a
modern office block viable. And the
site languished as a car park valued at
half a million dollars. Naturally, the
idea of building a residential block had
been mooted over the years. In other
parts of the world people lived in their
cities’ centres; but Australians were
different, they valued their suburban
way of life; at least, the State Govern-
ment would not sanction the building
of mixed developments in Sydney’s
centre.
In 1965 the Government relented, the
site was promptly bought by Stocks and
Holdings—a property company whose
residential developments had for some
years been closing in on the centre
of Sydney and the company
announced plans for a mixed com-
mercial and residential development to
be called Park Regis at a cost of $5
million.
A primary objective of S & H was
to keep the cost of the residential units
involved as low as possible, and cer-
tainly no more than a couple of
thousand dollars in excess of similar
units at inner-harborside suburbs. This
modest difference, it was believed, could
be justified in the minds of would-be
buyers by the convenience of the posi-
tion and the broadness of the views—
from a hundred feet up or more, that
is. The necessity of reaching the views
and utilising them for the advantage
of every occupier dictated that the
building must needs be tall, thin, and
articulated. The problem of that first
hundred feet overlooking blank walls
—and office windows —was resolved in
the planning of four floors of car-
parking and a 10-floored motel.
The taller the building the more
expensive it is to build. Structurally it
needs more complex design and more
sophisticated equipment to carry out
that design, a factor which can add as
much as 40 percent to the cost of a
unit in the city compared with one in
an average-sized block in the suburbs,
says Mr. John Hammond, a director
of S & H. But the higher cost can to
some extent be compensated by the
greater usage of site allowed in the
city. Hammond explains: “In the sub-
urbs say at Darling Point it is
permissible to build on only 20-25
percent of the site, while the total floor
area of the building must not exceed
1.15 times the site area. In the city one
is allowed to use the entire site, and
the floor area of the building is limited
to 12 times the site area.”
A tall building is also more expen-
sive to construct than a shorter, fatter
version of the same floor area because
it takes longer a point which is per-
haps less obvious than it appears. Ham-
mond points out: “It would be most
uneconomical for any company to use
its own funds for the period of con-
struction, no matter how big the com-
pany. No matter how high the interest
rate never lower in recent years
than 8 percent the only reasonable
way to finance is through borrowed
funds to an extent of 80 percent of the
total building cost. This bridging
finance is flexible, the builder only
paying interest for the precise period
of borrowing, which he aims to keep
as short as possible.” By such means
the builder maximises the scope of his
business. At the same time, the asking
Park Regis . . . revitalising the city?
price for a unit valued at $20,000 in
an average-sized block in the suburbs,
taking a year to build, would have to
include the interest on that finance—
s24oo, an earning-rate of 12 percent
being considered “most satisfactory” by
financiers and builders alike. By .com-
pletion date, next May, Park Regis
will have been 20 months in the build-
ing and the interest on a similarly-
valued unit will have risen to $4OOO.
Another aspect of the time factor
intrudes. As the demand for living
accommodation is a continuous process,
so the selling of it must be. Hammond
estimated that a building the size of
Park Regis would take anything up to
two years to sell, so bringing the total
interest charges on that $20,000 unit to
$6400 and creating an asking price
which he reckoned would frighten off
the most ardent, would-be city dweller:
“In order to be able to proceed with
Park Regis we had to assume that it
would be sold out by completion date.”
To ensure this as far as possible it was
decided to work on a flexible design
throughout the construction period,
using a basic plan of six bachelor units
and two two-bedroomed units on each
floor which could be combined into
larger units when the demand arose.
Another factor with regard to the
rapid selling of Park Regis was given
serious consideration: with a ceiling
height of nine feet (the minimum for
office space) potential buyers such as
dentists or lawyers wishing to carry on
their practices from the premises could
be accommodated; with the ceilings at
eight feet six inches another two
floors could be fitted within the height
limits imposed on the building. The
dentists were turned away: “And it
occurred to us we might be sorry,”
comments Hammond.
Today, however, there is little reason
for sorrow. “Exclusively residential”
one-bedroomed units the motel has a
separate entrance and lift—have been
selling like fairly hot cakes at $lB,OOO
apiece, compared with $16,000 for
similar units in the more fashionable
suburbs. And with four months still to
go before completion date, 83 percent
of the residential area is reported to
have been sold under Strata Title and
the motel leased out to Australian Motel
Industries.
Park Regis has been a smoothly
handled and generally successful exer-
cise in complex economic and architec-
tural planning. And yet in a building
that will house shops, a bank, a 130-
roomed motel, and something in excess
of 200 living - units, there is parking
accommodation for only 157 cars. Did
something, somewhere, go wrong?
According to John Hammond, S & H
would have liked room for up to 400
cars but found itself bridled by a local
council intent on keeping cars out of
the city centre by limiting parking
space. Laudable though such an aim is
in a world where so many cities have
been submerged in a sea of traffic, the
application of the policy in this instance
seems at best unimaginative most
city-dwellers being prone to developing
a sudden need to get away from it all
at times and curiously at odds with
the Lord Mayor’s “wholehearted sup-
port” for a project which was to
“revitalise the city.” Hammond shrugs
off the matter: the limitation has pre-
sented S & H with no special selling
problems so far; and he’s very much
looking forward to that five-minute
walk to the office which probably
also goes for the business and profes-
sional men, the graziers and the diplo-
mats, and the honored guests of Aus-
tralian and overseas corporations
(Woolworths have taken an entire
floor) who will be staying there. Park
Regis seems destined to house a largely
impermanent population.
Despite being the first development
of its kind in Sydney’s centre since the
war and one of the largest in the world,
Park Regis has added up in some minds
to something less than the beginnings
of a “revitalised city centre.” This is
to ignore the fact that its concept was
as revolutionary in Australian terms as
the building of those first block of liv-
ing units 20 years ago. In investing $5
million in ideas of cities retarding their
sprawl outward and increasing their
climb upward, of a population swing
not only back into the older, inner
suburbs but on into the city centre,
no less a gamble was being taken. No
living accommodation has climbed
higher or swung closer into an Aus-
tralian city than Park Regis, and if
the economics of the day have pre-
cluded a completely residential develop-
ment, a more permanently resident
population, and a more handsome addi-
tion to the Sydney skyline, the achieve-
ment remains.
S & H are preparing to back their
ideas again, and to that end have
acquired the old YMCA building at
the corner of Liverpool and Common-
wealth Streets for a further mixed
development. Not that they expect the
demand for city apartments to be any-
thing other than a small one in the
foreseeable future, but steady—in the
region of about a hundred a year thinks
Hammond. So the plans are being laid,
and a start will be made sometime next
year on a 39-floor building in which
three floors will be designed with those
disappointed dentists in mind. After
all, with suburbanism so deeply en-
trenched in the Australian way of life,
one cannot be really sure just how
small the demand for purely residential
accommodation is going to be.

The New Year
clean-up
still proceeds
THIS WEEK it’s straight to business
and my first buy was Cockburn
Cement, the Australian subsidiary of
Rugby Portland Cement of the U.K.
The company operates out of its name-
sake area near the industrial area of
Kwinana in Western Australia. Since
listing some six months ago, its shares,
which have been loyally and profitably
supported by a wad of English invest-
ors, have been perky performers. They
made their debut on the Exchange
floor at around the $l.BO mark and
have been rising ever since. They fin-
ished 1967 at around $3.50 and entered
1968 with such zest that they are now r
up to $4.10.
Apart from the expectation that a
healthy final report will be released
in April for the year ended December,
1967, the main reason for such bull-
ishness is the proposed expansion in
the company’s capacity. Later this year
a third manufacturing unit will more
than double the company’s capacity
from 260,000 tons per annum to
560,000 tons per annum. The reason for
such a large increase is that Perth,
where the company holds the major
share of the cement market, and West-
ern Australia generally are needing
more and more cement to cope with a
very much accelerated demand, caused
by the much-publicised boom “out
West.”
On the subject of demand, it would
seem that new cars are one item that
are currently very much to the fore-
front. The latest Commonwealth statis-
tics show that for every month of 1967
new motor vehicles registrations ex-
ceeded those of the corresponding
month in 1966, the increase becoming
more marked in the later months.
These figures are worth remembering if
you are thinking of doing any trading
in the motor vehicle section over the
next couple of months.
Next on the shopping list was a
finance company. With the excellent
spate of interims coming from most of
the major hire-purchase companies,
such as Associated Securities, it seems
a good idea to get on the band wagon.
General Credits, as the lowest-priced
bank - affiliated company, looked the
ticket. Since 1962 the company has
increased its profit from $336,000 to
last year’s record of $1,053,000, this
being achieved without the benefit of
additional ordinary capital (although
about $2 million was raised by prefer-
ence shares issues) and without a back-
ward step in any one year. If the com-
pany continues this trend of earning
increases, there is a reasonable possi-
bility that it will soon also increase
its dividend rate. Its last increase was
in 1965, when the payout rate was in-
creased from 6.66 percent to 8 percent.
At that time the earning rate was 10.5
percent. This year earnings look like
being somewhere around 16 percent of
ordinary capital, which gives the com-
pany plenty of room to manoeuvre in
the dividend section. Either way the
company looks good value at $0.71.
Another company that is good value
(and which incidentally has been get-
ting a lot of good Press lately) is
Brooker Holdings Ltd. The main
reason for this company’s recent success
was its decision back in 1965 to set up
an aluminium boating division. Since
then it’s been going great guns profit
has risen by over one hundred percent,
the earning rate has jumped from 11.9
percent to 26 percent, and the dividend
rate has been lifted from 10 percent
to 12 percent. For a good medium-term
investment the stock looks hard to beat.
My New Year clean-up of stock is
still on and I again had six sales this
week. The main one was Transoil. As
you will recall, this stock was only pur-
chased a week ago, but since then it
has been acting in a most inconsistent
sort of way and has shown no really
definite trend one way or another. The
long and short of it was that I became
nervous and sold out at 32 cents. How-
ever, I certainly can’t complain the
one-week holding returned me a net
profit of $419. The five other sales were
also all profitable ones, though not as
rewarding as Transoil. Bennett and
Wood earned $2B, Planet Oil $l9,
Hunter Douglas $ll, Lindeman’s $45,
and King Island Scheclite $66. Total
profit from the six sales was $5BB.

MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
IT WASN’T SO MUCH the upping of
interest rates on the short- and medium-
term tranches of the new Common-
wealth loan that made the market
ponder last week. The increases, pretty
marginal, in fact, merely brought offi-
cial rates in line with commercial ones.
It was rather that it was taken to be
a pointer to the higher rates which now
look written on the wall, even for long-
term bonds, as a result of the complex
forces operating in that direction—not
only seasonal ones, either—which were
canvassed in The Bulletin last week.
The extent of upward adjustments in
interest rates now likely to ensue as a
result of local and overseas pressures is,
of course, anybody’s guess, with so
much tinder about both at home and
abroad which could easily ignite to the
discomfort of everybody, including
■those in the lending business. Under-
standably, also, in the heady atmos-
phere created by the antics of the big
fish such as Western Mining and BHP,
it was unlikely that the more sober-
minded of the financial fraternity
would be heard all that attentively
muttering prognostications of tighter
anc j dearer money to come,
„.., , , ,
J The new element in the local capital
demand and su PPty equation, is
naturally Western Mining s big issue
which, along with BHP s debenture, is
going to drain off a considerable propor-
tion of investable funds in the near
future. Happily, WMC has staggered the
amount it will be asking to be sub-
scribed well into the future; this fits in
quite nicely with the likely flow of avail-
able investment funds in the immediate
and near future, as well as allowing
subscribers to squeeze the maximum tax
advantages available to themselves in
the provision of what Sir Lindesay
Clark euphemistically called risk capital
in a mining venture (though where the
risk lay in this case could easily be
puzzling the tax commissioners).
The prospect of tighter money and
higher interest rates poses problems for
investors in shares of companies pur-
veying money, meaning those whose
shares comprise the official indexes for
banks and other finance companies.
Over the past year, there’s no question
that on market performance bank shares
have easily beaten their rivals in the
outer finance company world. The
measure of this is that the Melbourne
Stock Exchange index for bank shares
has risen from 112.4 to 148, or by 32
percent, over the past year, while that
of “other finance” companies has come
up from about 70 to 84, a rise of only
17 percent. Without putting too fine a
point on it, the rise in market status
of bank shares reflects the new deal
afforded the banks by Coombs and
McMahon, coupled with striking profit
increases.
The other side of Dr. Coombs’ penny
is that the banks have been horning in
on some lines of the lending business
that their finance company rivals liked
to think of as mostly their own, though
in the welter of business offering over
the past year there would appear to
have been enough for everybody. As a
matter of fact, even if finance com-
panies couldn’t quite match the rises
in at least some of the banks’ profits
last year, they still showed a remark-
able recovery from the previous one
when the long credit drought hit them;
it was only after September, 1966, that
what can now be seen as a sustained
period of recovery for finance company
profits was set in train.
There’s plenty of evidence in the
latest interims reported by finance com-
panies, notably AGC, CAGA, and Asso-
ciated Securities, that this recovery was
well sustained in the second half of
1967. All three reported profit increases
in the 12 to 15 percent range for the
period. Earlier, Custom Credit regis-
tered an increase of 11.3 percent, which
prompts the suggestion that, as the
yield on these shares is only 4.1 percent
at the current price of 120 cents after
last week’s rise whereas most of the

LONGREACH OIL LTD. was first recommended in February, 1967, at price levels
of about 31c. The 80c target was achieved in November last year, and tbe situation
now calls for reassessment in view of recent market action. Although volume has
not been reproduced with the chart, it shows an extremely strong technical situation
and there is now the possibility of a further rise in the short- to medium-term to
an objective of about $1.65. Last sale price on 2/2/68 —85c.

Envelope export manager, John McDougall
Licking exporting.
Energetic John McDougall, and his men
at Besley & Pike Pty. Ltd., have licked a
big profitable envelope market in
South East Asia and the Pacific.
For a time, sales had been slow. So they
developed an envelope that didn’t glue up
in tropical storage. It was a simple modifica-
tion in the adhesive - and it gave
them a unique sales advantage. To seal
the business further they opened sales
offices, appointed agents in some areas.
Now they’re holding a good share of a
lucrative market.
Does Besley & Pike’s success give you a
thought? Could you begin to export your
product by making a slight modification
in its performance, price, size, colour or
appearance? Study the markets. Study
your product: You’ll find that exporting
can be easier than you think.
Note: Exporting can increase your
turnover; can lower unit costs of your
product; can iron out seasonal fluctuations;
and can increase profits. Your company
will gain extra marketing knowledge,
and prestige.
The government helps you with:
Payroll tax, travel and promotion costs;
EPIC export insurance cover; Trade
Commissioner Services; promotion
publicity; and Department of Trade and
Industry facilities.

other leaders in the industry yield con-
siderably more (lAC, 5.7; CAGA, 5.9,
etc.), those interested in this class of
share should explore the switching possi-
bilities, taking comfort perhaps in the
thought of one current theory that the
banks are less likely to do as well as
the finance companies in the emerging
conditions.
THE SEVERE DRY in Victoria, South
Australia, and southern New South
Wales did not prevent Ralph McKay,
Melbourne-based agricultural equip-
ment producer, from selling higher in
the December six months, but the
Westralian, Chamberlain Holdings Ltd.,
said the weather conditions depressed
their market for agricultural tractors
and implements.
Chamberlain’s industrial tractor busi-
ness was very firm, however, allowing
group sales and profits to show encour-
aging increase. The 50c shares at $1.76,
yielding 3.6 percent on the current 12J
percent dividend (established in 1964)
and 9.5 percent on 1967 earning rate
of 33.5 percent, seem inevitably destined
for higher things. They were up to
$2.02 in 1967, anyhow.
IT SEEMS HUMAN NATURE for
company directors to blame circum-
stances beyond their control for
declines in profitability, and attribute
improvement to their own efforts.
Dunlop Australia Ltd., reporting a
meritorious 43 percent rise in profit
for the December half-year, said the
intensive drive for internal efficiency
and economy throughout the group con-
tinued, and had been greatly aided by
the response of management at all
levels. Implementation of further phases
in management reorganisation was
under active study, they said.
They neglected to mention that auto
industry conditions were a whole lot
better. The motor trade has recovered
from recent dullness, and this is the
biggest market for Dunlop products,
diversification notwithstanding.
The day of the interim report,
Dunlop shares broke through the $2
barrier. Looking back to the 20-year
low of $1.15 in 1966 suggests that the
prudent investor should not permit a
one-time blue chip to approach parity
unless it is actually trading at a loss.
True, the ten percent dividend had been
cut to eight percent for two years, but
in 1966, Dunlop’s worst year, earning-
rate was 8.2 percent. Eighteen months
later, the first half’s results indicate an
annual earning rate of 18.2 percent, and
dividend is now up to an annual nine
percent.
SHAREHOLDERS OF the diverse
transport group, Brambles Industries,
may obtain a 7J percent return for eight
years (or 1\ percent for 15 years) on
debenture stock now offered for their
subscription. But the 4.8 percent return
now obtainable from additional invest-
ment in the 50c shares currently selling
around $1.26, close to their 1967 low,
should be supplemented by a substan-
tial rise in market value, to compare
more than favorably with the fixed in-
terest yield of debentures.
Dividend is currently 12 percent a
year, after scaling down from 15 per-
cent with the one-for-four bonus and
one-for-eight par issue of last year.
Investors who want a stake in
Western Australia’s phenomenal de-
velopment, without the hazards
inherent in mining stocks, could con-
sider Brambles, whose long-term con-
tract to handle the pig-iron production
at BHP’s Kwinana steelworks will re-
quire the company to make substantial
investment in additional plant and
equipment. The new debenture funds
will assist in financing this and other
aspects of the group’s expansion pro-
gram.
A 20 PERCENT PROFIT lift for
the first half of Philip Morris’ year
could mean a near-quadrupling of
profits in 1967-68 since 1963, a
trebling since 1964. Coming up from
behind, Philip Morris is about to over-
take Rothmans in profit-making capac-
ity. Until Rothmans’ dismal showing
in 1966-67, when profit was less than
$1.8m., it had held profits around the
s3m. mark for several years. Judging
by Philip Morris’ performance in the
December half, the year’s result could
approach s3m. also.
Their relative market capitalisation
is $24.48m. for Philip Morris (at $4.80)
and $19.1 lm. for Rothmans (at $2.10),
seemingly cognisant of Morris’ gather-
ing momentum. Unless Rothmans
comes up with evidence of a very strong
recovery in its interim report, Morris
shares are the more attractive for
growth, assuming the priority is not in-
come, and provided the investor is will-

GROSBY SHOES-
HEART AND SOUL!
Once Grosby moulded the soles
for their ‘Shipmates’ from
natural materials. These days
Ithe fast growing band of Grosby
wearers are getting an even
better product - thanks to Geon.
Geon is a polyvinyl chloride
resin made by B.F. Goodrich-CSR
Chemicals. It can be made into
any shape from boats to bottles,
clear or coloured, and may be
formulated for clarity, rigidity,
high impact resistance, flexibility
in the combination to suit you.
The soles of Grosby ‘Shipmates’
are iniection moulded from Geon
PVC, a process Grosby intro-
duced four years ago and with
which they have now completely
replaced old methods.
Their customers like the longer
wear they get from Geon soles.
They prefer its greater comfort
and smarter, cleaner appearance.
Grosby profit from the fact that,
though they sell more shoes,
easy handling Geon PVC means
less labour and faster moving
production lines.
Behind Grosby's famous ‘Shipmates’
is a team of Geon-trained chemists
& and production experts who offer
the most advanced and efficient technical
service in Australia.

THE STRONG, SILENT FOOD in-
dustry supplier, Mauri Bros, and Thom-
son, triggered off talk of another bonus
with its expected dividend lift in the
interim to 11 percent a year, the rate
at which handouts have been made in
the past, the last a one-for-four in 1965.
The terse statement that turnover and
profits for the November half were
higher than for the previous corres-
ponding period, with New Zealand
profits included at devalued rates, was
not much to go on for the present or
potential investor.
Earning rate in the past four years
has been remarkably steady at about
21 percent. At $2.05 the yield is a tiny
2.7 percent, one of the lowest outside
the mining market. Present holders may
be content, but the uninformed outsider
need not rush this one.
PERSISTENT TALK that BHP would
make a takeover bid for Ampol
Petroleum, interspersed with talk of a
takeover by Caltex, and suggestions of
a merger wirh H. C. Sleigh, or a
share investment by Boral, has fanned
the volume of Ampol share dealings.
A 30 percent price rise to around $1.20
in the last three weeks has been on
increasingly high volume.
The directors’ confident prediction
of a substantial increase in group earn-
ings, largely emanating from Ampol
Exploration’s W.A. oilfield, in itself
almost justifies current enthusiasm.
Once again, the survivors of a loss of
general confidence in a leader (the
50c shares scraped along at 57c some-
time last year when the company was
reduced to a 10 percent dividend, with
little cover) have been vindicated.


Security analysis
The excellent profit ratios of
Electrical Equipment
I LIKE TO THINK of Electrical
Equipment of Australia Ltd. (EEA for
short) as being the nearest Australian
equivalent to the Square D Company.
Not that there is any connection or
association between the two companies
and EEA particularly prides itself on
its 100 percent Australian ownership.
But there seems to me to be an affinity
perhaps in their philosophy of approach,
apart from the fact that both produce
and sell electrical machinery, equip-
ment, and supplies.
For the record, Square D is about 20
times the size of Electrical Equipment
of Australia in total assets employed
and about 10 times as big in the num-
ber of persons employed. Yet, in the
U.S.A., Square D is itself only a David
compared with the Goliaths of General
Electric and Westinghouse for
example, it has less than 3 percent of
the assets employed by GE. But Square
D earns each year over 2\ times as
much on sales and almost twice as
much on shareholders’ funds as the
average for the U.S. electrical manu-
facturing industry as a whole. For the
statistically minded, Square D in 1966
earned a remarkable 13.1 percent in
net earnings after tax to turnover, and
24.7 percent in net earnings after tax
to shareholders’ funds.
The “Delfin Digest,” the directory of
top companies in Australia, shows
EEA as controlling only about 1 percent
of the $6OO million assets making up
the top 40 electrical manufacturing
companies in Australia. However, in an
industry where over 50 percent of the
total assets are controlled by subsidiaries
of overseas companies, EEA is among
the five top performers in terms of
profit return to funds employed. In
fact, Electrical Equipment of Australia
reports a profit ratio to funds employed
which is more than double the Aus-
tralian industry average.
In 1937, two electrical engineers,
Alan Crook and Gregory Kater, formed
the predecessor to the present Electri-
cal Equipment of Australia. In the
first year, a loss of $l2OO was incurred
and even in 1947 net profit was only
a modest $1756. Progress since then
has been very rapid, for, by 1950, when
EEA went public, net earnings after
tax had risen to $35,390. Over the past
17-year interval to 1967, shareholders
were to see net earnings rise by 20
times to over $750,000.
Exit Mr. Crook in 1947 and enter
Mr. Norman Palmer. Mr. Palmer was
appointed general manager and chief
executive officer. Mr. Palmer died in
1967 and with him went the tribute of
having built up a very successful com-
pany. Mr. R. F. Stein, a colleague of
Mr. Palmer going back almost 30 years,
succeeded to the chief-executive-officer
position in 1967. Mr. Kater, the co-
founder, has been company chairman
almost since the company’s inception,
and his family investment company
remains the largest single shareholder.
Apart from the original factory at
St. Leonards (Sydney), all the other
manufacturing units in the group were
acquired in share and cash takeovers.
From the original 20,000 sq. ft. factory
unit, six factories in the Sydney sub-
urbs of St. Leonards, Rockdale, Arn-
cliffe, Bexley, North Sydney, and
Rozelle now cover a total manufactur-
ing area of 261,000 sq. ft. Group
employment exceeds 1000. Exports to
overseas countries represent about 10
percent of group annual turnover. Con-
versely, imports of components and
supply for local re-sale or for incor-
poration into company products repre-
sent about ten to 15 percent of total
turnover. EEA have agency and/or
licensing agreements with some 30 to
40 overseas companies.
In the group turnover made up from
local manufacture, telephone and tele-
communications equipment, electric
motors, electric switchgear, and “other
lines” make up approximately an equal
volume in dollar sales. “Other lines”
include time-recording and timing
devices, hot water systems, and earth-
ing rods. Transmission Products Pty.
Ltd., the group subsidiary in telephone
and telecommunications equipment,
makes no attempt to compete with the
giants—the four overseas controlled
companies, STC, TEI (Plessey), L. M.
Ericsson, and Siemens, who supply most
of the major equipment bought by the
PMG Department. Transmission Pro-
ducts makes money out of filling in the
gaps of supplying on a mass-production
basis small accessory components to
fine tolerances which the major com-
panies and the PMG buy in. For
example, they produce a patented plug
and socket which connects the flexible
lead to the telephone set. They make
more telephone plugs and jacks than
any other Australian manufacturer, and
they are the only mass producer in
Australia of cord-type switchboards.
Another product line is a loading coil,
which leads to clearer speech trans-
mission by helping to eliminate cross
talk from other subscribers’ conversa-
tions when you lift the receiver.
One area where the EEA group
believes in direct competition with the
overseas majors is in fractional and
integral electric motors up to 5 hp.
GMF Electric Motors Pty. Ltd., the
group subsidiary, is now one of the top
two marketers of electric motors in
Australia, which are used widely in
domestic appliances and in multi-
tudinous industrial and commercial
applications. GMF is one of the few
companies to rely wholly on Australian
design ability and not on overseas know-
how to produce better and more effi-
cient electric motors. They are now
using the services of a computer to
help them find the most successful com-
binations in producing the most econo-
mical, efficient, and powerful motor in
a given size.
Australian Line Materials Pty. Ltd.,
another group subsidiary, makes high
tension outdoor switchgear and is one
of the top two marketers in Australia
of isolators and earthing switches,
which are used by electricity supply
authorities in both the transmission and
distribution of electricity. The acquisi-
tion of the associated companies,
Canney and Towe Pty. Ltd. and Aus-
tralian Insulated Ironworks Pty. Ltd.,
in January, 1968, at a cost of $300,000
cash, add complementary products to-
Australian Line Materials’ range. The
two new members of the group produce
pole-line hardware and earthing rods.
One significant and profitable associa-
tion in the new group structure will be
that Canney and Towe and its associ-
ate, who are large customers for gal-
vanising and machining, will now pur-
chase their annual requirements from
Australian Line Materials, which has
considerable facilities for this type of
work. The earthing rods, made of steel
and copper, using a patented process,
come in lengths which can be joined
and driven to a depth of 140 ft. Both
electricity supply authorities and the
PMG are increasingly insisting on the
use of earthing rods, so this business
should show rapid growth.
EEA’s subsidiary, Australian Time
Recording Co. Pty. Ltd., makes and
sells time recorders and timing devices.
The company is very proud of its foot-
ball timers, which incorporate some
Swiss parts. The company also imports
Patek Philippe crystal chronometers as
master clocks, which have the reputa-

I am impressed with the logic of
EEA’s management principles, which
have been followed for many years and
which have helped in the development
of the company. These principles
Include:
Diversify within the electrical indus-
try, but never outside. (In other words,
know your strength, don’t dissipate it.)
In building up a group of companies,
look for a product range and turnover
composition where there is sufficient
diversity of production to balance the
ups and downs in government and
business orders. The company tries to
achieve a balance in its turnover mix,
so that the four sectors of Federal
Government; State, local and semi-
government; industry and consumers
will contribute in proportionately equal
volume. This is the ideal goal which
the company strives for.
In management philosophy, operate
on a system of almost complete decen-
tralisation, so that each of the company
managers in the major subsidiaries re-
tains extreme flexibility and autonomy
in running their business.
Don’t manufacture in competition
with your customers.

Over the four years 1963-1967, net
earnings after tax increased at almost
double the rate of increase in total
assets —the cumulative increase in net
earnings was 82.5 percent, compared to
an increase in total assets of 46.4 per-
cent, earnings per share rose by a
cumulative 79 percent over the four-
year period, and dividends per share
by 51.8 percent.
There was no growth in profit in
1967, the first pause in profit expansion
since 1961, but from what I hear the
group is on the march again.
SUMMING UP:
The Bulletin (March 18, 1967), re-
porting that the company “always
seems to have comforting news for
shareholders,” advised that “investors
might as well clamber on for the ride.”
I would agree in the light of events
today and suggest that the ride would
be eminently worth while taking. At
$2.32, the shares have a dividend yield
of 3.7 percent and the price earnings
ratio is 12.3. The shares are very tightly
held; in the absence of a volatile market
turnover they tend to be and currently
are underpriced.

We plan to make them work 25 hours a day!
In a country like Australia
with its very low rainfall,
there is a demand for reli-
able pumps of all types for
primary and secondary in-
dustry. Pump reliability is of
vital importance. That is why
McPherson’s developed
their own range of pumps
and built a highly mechan-
ised factory for pump pro-
duction at Tottenham near
Melbourne. Ajax pumps
made by McPherson’s are
not copies of overseas
models. They are wholly
designed and manufactured
in Australia in more than
90 different types. For over
25 years, Ajax end suc-
tion, multi-stage, submer-
sible, vertical sump, rotary
gear, diaphragm and piston
pumps have been proving
their exceptional depend-
ability under the severest
conditions. Many operate 24
hours a day with little or no
maintenance. Because this
high standard performance
was also wanted elsewhere,
Ajax pumps are today win-
ning valuable export con-
tracts all over the world.

Mining
Greenvale and Kambalda nickels
IN ASSESSING THE worth of large-
scale low-grade mining ventures a
small variation in ore grade has a
large effect on profitability. If annual
ore production is, say, two million
tons, then a change in grade of only
.1 percent will mean a fall in metal
production of two thousand tons
quite a lot of money in the case of
a nickel mine, when nickel is selling
for $lBOO a ton. In an underground
mine like Western Mining’s, where the
ore grade is relatively high, such a
small variation is not so important and
the orebody can be mined more selec-
tively so as to avoid the extraction of
ore which falls below any nominated
value. But in any open-cut operation,
such as may be initiated by Metals
Exploration and Freeport Sulphur,
ability to bypass lower-grade ore is
severely curtailed. The economics of
large-scale open-cut mining on a low-
grade orebody requires the continuous
removal of large quantities of ore
without too much regard for quality;
ore containing less than a specified
commercial quantity of mineral may be
either left in the ground if it does not
interfere with the extraction of payable
ore, or if it does, then dumped in a
stockpile or blended with better ore
for actual treatment.
For these reasons Metals Explora-
tion’s latest announcement is of some
interest, as it gives details of both the
estimated quantity of nickel ore at
Greenvale as well as specifying the
cut-off grade used in arriving at these
reserves. The deposit, which is situated
some 100 miles west of Townsville, has
now been drilled sufficiently for direc-
tors of the company to be able to state
that it appears to contain about 45
million tons of ore with an average
metal content of 1.55 percent nickel
and 0.11 percent cobalt. In arriving at
this estimate, ore containing less than
1.0 percent nickel has been ignored,
although there is also nickel in the over-
burden which contains values less than
1.0 percent of nickel. The significance
of using a cut-off grade of 1.0 percent
appears to be that at current prices this
grade is the one below which the de-
posits could not be commercially ex-
ploited. This implicitly assumes various
possible levels of cost for transport and
power and so forth, and no doubt has
as its starting point the basic assumption
that the ore, which is a lateritic type,
will be amenable to treatment by com-
mercially tested processes.
While all such assumptions have yet
to be justified, they are probably better
than most, as Freeport Sulphur, which
did the work on the deposit, itself has
some expertise in mining lateritic nickel
ore from its years in Cuba (before Cas-
tro). And the choice of a cut-off grade
of 1.0 percent seems to be adequately
conservative in the face of a strong
market for nickel and the prospect of
continuing strong world demand for
the metal.
On the basis, then, that a metal con-
tent of 1.0 percent is somewhere around
a break-even grade for the exploitation
of the deposit, it becomes very easy to
estimate likely profitability. The ore
contains 1.5 percent nickel so that,
ignoring the cobalt content of 0.11 per-
cent, 0.55 percent of the nickel content
will be available as a rough estimate
of gross mining profit. Realisation
charges for transport, smelting, and re-
fining will be higher than those incurred
by Western Mining, but there should
still be something like $BOO to $9OO per
ton of nickel left over after the deduction
of these charges from the current nickel
price of around $lBOO. The deposit of
45 million tons contains in all about
675,000 tons of nickel (at 1.55 percent)
and the 0.55 percent available to pro-
vide profits means a total of 247,500
tons. At a net $BOO per ton this repre-
sents quite a sizable figure—sl9B mil-
lion to be exact. Freeport Sulphur has
earned a 50 percent interest in the
project and hence the profit available
to Metals Exploration would come down
to $99 million.
The factors which would bear down
on this figure would depend largely on
the method of financing and on the
period over which the mine could be
properly exploited. And this latter item
is quite significant, as it affects amor-
tisation and depreciation charges, which
themselves will have a bearing on
annual profits. Obviously, the project
will be much more profitable on an
annual basis if worked over, say, 20
years than if worked over a longer
period of, say, 40 years, in spite of the
higher amortisation charges which the
shorter life would attract. Over a life
of 20 years, gross profits could be as
high as $lO million per year, and even
after Freeport Sulphur’s 50 percent
interest has been deducted, as well as
charges for depreciation and taxation,
etc., it is quite apparent that Metals
Exploration has a potential prize of con-
siderable dimension, perhaps even better
than Western Mining on a per-share
basis, with only six million shares issued
against Western Mining’s eleven
million.
But and it is quite a big but
all this is only on the assumption that
the ore is amenable to treatment by
commercially tested processes. Metals
Exploration has itself stated that the

extraction of nickel from lateritic ores
is more difficult than from sulphide
ores; it requires either direct smelting
or other complex processes. The metal-
lurgical testing needed to determine
this is likely to take some time, and
it is w r orth remembering that there is
another deposit of lateritic nickel ore in
Australia wdiich is, at 60 million tons,
larger than the Greenvale deposit but
which has not been commercially feas-
ible due to a combination of metal-
lurgical problems and geographical
remoteness (in the Blackstone Ranges
near the confluence of the Western
Australian, South Australian, and Nor-
thern Territory borders).
Both these deposits have been paled
to insignificance by the latest develop-
ments at Kambalda, where the ore is
mostly a sulphide type very easily
treated, and the grade high enough
to take advantage of the latest tech-
niques and go directly into a refinery
without going through a smelter. To
justify recent share prices for Western
Mining, something like one million
tons of ore was looked for as an annual
throughput in a few years’ time. The
latest report indicates that this sort of
expectation looks like being proved too
conservative, in that such a level of
production is likely to be achieved
rather sooner than assumed in many
estimates of profitability.
The first nickel concentrates were
produced only 16 months after sinking
the initial drill hole at Kambalda, and
less than 12 months after the first shaft
was begun. The company’s second shaft
is already on the way with a third
planned and a treatment rate of
800,000 tons per year looks as though
it will be a reality within twelve
months. And this means that the com-
pany will be extracting ore from only
two of the six ore shoots so far dis-
covered! Already ore reserves have
been doubled from the 4.6 million
tons of 3.65 percent nickel proved last
June, an increase far in excess of the
company’s own estimate that it was
proving additional ore at the rate of
some 300,000 tons per month.
The matter-of-fact tone of Western
Mining’s report could not hide the
exciting implications of the actual
words: “The initial exploratory drilling
at Kambalda-St. Ives located six ore
shoots. In recent months drilling has
been concentrated on three of these
shoots with the object of providing
assured ore reserves as a basis for
expansion. The sulphide ore reserves
at Kambalda and St. Ives are now
estimated at 9,306,000 tons averaging
3.8 percent nickel . . . The limits in
depth of these ore shoots have not yet
been reached. Drilling in the other
three ore shoots has not advanced far
enough to enable estimates to be made,
but the results to date are comparable
to those in the ore shoots which make-
up the present reserves, at a similar
stage in drilling. There are also other
surface indications of ore not yet pros-
pected.”
If 800,000 tons of ore a year can be-
obtained from the three shafts to be
operated on the first two ore shoots, the
potential production of the six shoots
(with more to come?) can be almost
any figure the company desires. At an
annual production of two million tons
of ore from relatively shallow shafts it
is possible to apply the same sort of
yardstick of profitability as has been
used on Metals Exploration’s Green-
vale deposit of lateritic nickel—that is,
that an ore grade of 1 percent will be
someu'here near a break-even point for
mining. On Western Mining’s higher
grades of 3.8 percent nickel this leaves
over 2.5 percent of the metal content
available after mining costs have been
met. High as it may seem, there will
be 50,000 tons of nickel metal to pro-
vide the company’s annual gross profit.
On an estimated net price ex Kambalda
of $lOOO per ton this adds up to $5O
million. Quite a princely sum but
perhaps not so much when the com-
pany’s eleven million shares are selling
at over $5O each.

Commodities
Varied luck on the plantations
WORLD TRADE IN “plantation”
crops has presented a generally dis-
mal picture over the past seven years,
according to the latest review of the
subject by the Commonwealth Secre-
tariat. The review calculates that
among the heaviest price falls since
1960 are sugar, 39 percent, and rubber,
38 percent; Cocoa is cited at 13 per-
cent, but a recent movement on the
London market for which no single
factor has been held responsible
brought prices to their highest level for
seven years and is bound to have pared
this decrease.
RUBBER steadied recently under
the influence of the U.S. defence build-
up, following a slump on the London
market which was attributed to specu-
lation during those fearful gold-rush
days of last December. Prices were
forced down almost to the level of
the 1967 low, despite devaluation, and
contributed to the undermining of
Singapore values which fell back to
the 18-year lows reached last Septem-
ber. Other factors at work in Singapore
are said to include undercutting by
Indonesian rubber suppliers and, above
all, record stocks of some 170,000 tons.
COFFEE has also found its feet again,
following the nervous flutterings which
accompanied the exchanges between the
U.S. and Brazil during negotiations to
renew the International Coffee Agree-
ment. The U.S. is adamant about re-
taining its right to take unilateral action
to defend the interests of its domestic
industry. In other words, the world’s
largest coffee consumer reserves the
‘ right to impose a tarrif on imports of
soluble coffee from the world’s largest
producer, if it feels it is not being given
equal access to the coffee from which
that soluble is made. The Brazilians—
who in two years have captured 12 per-
cent of the U.S. market for soluble—
are equally adamant that the new
agreement must be multilateral in all
respects. Several months of brinkman-
ship resulted in deadlock, and negotia-
tions have now been adjourned for
three weeks. High-level missions from
the Coffee Council are at present visit-
ing both Washington and Rio de
Janeiro in the search for a peace for-
mula.
COTTON prices, on the other hand,
are threatening to reach such a high
level that the usual output of cotton
yarn in Western Europe will no longer
be viable. Increasing difficulties in the
disposal of yarn at current raw material
prices have been reported. And some
spinners, having turned to lower-grade
cottons in an attempt to hold down
production costs, have left merchants
of the better grades without a market.
Current high prices are said to stem
originally from the U.S. decision to
cut back output and run down stocks.
But this has been achieved much more
rapidly than was anticipated. Unfavor-
able growing conditions in the U.S.
are expected to result in a crop this
season of only eight million bales,
which augers for a world production-
consumption deficit of some five mil-
lion bales, compared with 4.5 million
bales in 1966-67.
The current difficulties of the world
markets, however, might well be partly
relieved by the record crop of 5.8 mil-
lion tons achieved in the U.S.S.R. last
year. Although the U.S.S.R. exported
an all-time record of 0.5 million tons,
of raw cotton last season, it is believed
that a large amount was held back.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
It was certainly back to last year’s boom days, only more
so, for those two eminences Western Mining Corporation and
BHP. Dealings in both shares were hectic and heavy; it is
history that WMC reached a peak $53, slipping back at
the end to $49.50 for a net $9.50 leap on the week. BHP
put on $1.65 to finish at $18.90. Peko became prominent
toward the close, its $ll.lO meaning a net advance of $2.02;
similarly CRA added 90 cents to hit $12.80. Among the
vigorous oils, Ampol Exploration gained 36 cents and Oil
Search 10 cents; Ampol Petroleum added 22 cents.


THE LAND
Down with wool’s defeatism
IT IS CERTAINLY impossible to
say that, since their publication last
October, the Wool Board’s latest
marketing proposals have engendered
very much confidence and support.
They have been strenuously attacked,
or at least criticised, by a great multi-
tude of organisations and individuals
connected with the wool industry; there
is extreme difficulty in calling to mind
any single source of wholehearted
agreement. In the face of such dis-
sent, one can only hope that, when
the Australian Wool Industry Confer-
ence reconsiders the Board’s proposals
next week, some notice of the in-
dustry’s mood will be taken, and no
attempt made to divide growers once
more with a program of old dogmas.
More and more there appears some-
thing unbalanced in this intense con-
centration upon marketing, especially
for a commodity being sold on inter-
national markets. Obviously the in-
famous cost-price squeeze must be
tackled, yet, in Mr. G. S. Le Couteur’s
almost offhand words last week,
“fiddling around with the basic supply
line will not work.” That was clearly
the line being taken by the Inter-
national Wool Textile Organisation
when it resolved to ask Australian
growers to reassess their Board’s in-
tentions. The list of countries voting
in favor of that motion should surely
exercise some restraint on proponents
of statutory boards and attempts to
interfere with free flow; it included
South Africa, Belgium, France, Italy,
Germany, and Japan.
Recent domestic opposition to the
Board’s notions is proving just as im-
portant as the almost unanimous over-
seas rejections, and it has been rather
remarkable for one feature alone. Des-
pite the prevailing and doubtful price
situation, there are not lacking growers
and others ready to adopt a more
optimistic attitude about wool’s future.
Something a lot more positive than
sheer defeatism is bound up in the host
of suggestions now flying around about
improving management technique, rais-
ing productivity, and bringing about
structural alterations within the in-
dustry. Nowhere was this more appar-
ent than at last week’s very prac-
tical Sydney forum on wool’s future
run by the Committee for Economic
Development of Australia.
The first speaker, Mr. A. S. Dun-
stan, deputy general manager of Dal-
gety and New Zealand Loan, played
the well-known population-increase
gambit to some effect. Despite the pri-
macy of cotton and the marked inroads
of synthetics, world consumption of
wool has remained constant at lib. per
head over the past 17 years. “The
world’s human population is increasing
much faster than the world’s sheep
population and, in fact, in the past four
years for which we have figures there
has been no increase in total wool pro-
duction, and certainly no increase in
apparel types,” Mr. Dunstan argued.
He felt able to point out there has
always been a ready market for wool
and it is not unreasonable to assume
that any increase in the production of
better wools would willingly be taken
up by users. Briefly, the demand for
textiles is rising; wool production is not
rising; production of synthetic fibres is
increasing rapidly; unless more wool is
produced, synthetics are likely to be
used to bridge the gap.
Now that theory may not inevitably
apply, yet presumably it holds out
more hope to Australian woolgrowers
than a device to rig the market out of
fear of price fluctuations. And it is
doubly interesting that Mr. Dunstan
laid considerable emphasis on pro-
motion, with the twist of giving sup-
port to the promotion of wool blends.
That tune was also taken up by
Merriwa grower Mr. I. Steele-Park,
who, in the midst of some general
pessimism (“those that are still swim-
ming are beginning to flounder”), put
in a plea for better management of
properties. He ended with a string of
down-to-earth palliatives: a concerted
and purposeful research program;
more salesmanship to Australian re-
tailers; the abolition of land tax; the
introduction of drought bonds; the
right to pay off probate on a rural
estate in instalments over a number
of years; an increase in the superphos-
phate bounty; a more equitable method
of apportioning shire rates between
town and country.
Those are all factual, discussable
remedies, far removed from the cloud
cuckoo land of statutory control and
support prices. To cap the forum, Dr.
Bruce Davidson scotched the case for
direct subsidies: “The payment of sub-
sidies to stabilise wool prices would
simply discourage the adoption of tech-
niques needed to increase efficiency and
lead to a misallocation of resources
between Australian industries.”
Agrisearch
Asians can't always drink milk
WITH COMMENDABLE SPIRIT the
Australian Dairy Produce Board began
establishing milk factories in Asia
several years ago. The first, at Singa-
pore', went into production in Nov-
ember, 1964. Two more soon followed
—one in Bangkok and another near
Manila. They make sweetened con-
densed milk by recombining Australian
non-fat milk solids and butter oil and
adding locally produced sugar.
So far the dairies have been a re-
sounding success. They have captured
a large share of the established market
for sweetened condensed milk which
European firms had begun to create
long before World War II. By the
time the Australian-Asian plants were
in production, large numbers of people
in such cosmopolitan cities as Singa-
pore, Bangkok, and Hong Kong had
become accustomed to this kind of
milk and were taking it as part of their
normal daily diet. Each of the three
Australian factories has a large output.
Unfortunately, this enterprising
scheme seems doomed to slow growth
once the established market of accus-
tomed milk-users is saturated. In par-
ticular, the dream of improving the
daily diet of the average Asian by
supplying him with condensed milk
seems to have come up against a natural
barrier. Research conducted by Drs.
Davis and Bolin, of the University of
New South Wales, at Prince Henry
Hospital, Sydney, has disclosed that
milk makes most adult Asians sick.
It turns out that almost to a man they
are unable to digest lactose, the sugar
in milk. Less than three ounces of this
sugar is sufficient to induce marked
abdominal pain, collywobbles, and
diarrhoea. All but one of 20 Chinese
and Indian students at the University
had this reaction after being given
lactose in water. The exceptional case
provides an important clue. He is an
Indian who has lived in Australia for
about 14 years, during which time he
has become well acquainted with our
Western-style diet.
The Dairy Board’s job in Asia would
seem, therefore, to be only just begin-
ning. Having overcome the technical

and commercial problems of manufac-
turing milk in Asia, the next, and more
difficult stage is to edufcate the stomachs
of the potential consumers and the
people most in need of the health and
strength that can be derived from dairy
foods. The effort would be well worth-
while if the results in Japan are taken
as a guide. Since the war, milk drinking
has been encouraged in that country
and the present generation of children
is markedly superior in physique, health,
and intelligence.
The United Nations Organisation,
which is deeply committed to helping
Asia cope with its food shortage, might
be prevailed upon to help the Dairy
Board mount milk-promotion schemes.
One wonders, also, what happens to all
the milk powder that the various chari-
ties have managed to send to India and
other places. No doubt the children up
to a certain age retain their ability to
digest lactose and would profitably
enjoy eating any milk provided for
them. Otherwise it must be presumed
that free milk doled out to the needy in
India merely produces a lot of upset
stomachs and disillusionment. Clearly,
the business of bringing aid to Asia is
fraught with difficulty and it is to be
hoped that Drs. Davis and Bolin can
push on with their research and define
more precisely who can drink milk in
Asia and how those who can’t take it
straight may be introduced to this valu-
able food. The small sample of people
involved in their study is not represen-
tative.
But all is not lost. The CSIRO’s
forward-looking Division of Dairy
Research recognised some time ago that
sweetened condensed milk is not the
only means, or always the most suitable
way, of improving Asian diets. It had
also recognised that some people, even
in the West, let alone the East, have
trouble with lactose, though it had prob-
ably not suspected that the intolerance
might be almost universal in Asia.
Accordingly, the Division set about
developing a lactose-free milk powder
and a recipe for offering it in the form
of a baked biscuit. Recently it was able
to announce that a pilot trial on a com-
mercial scale had shown that, if minor
modifications are made to existing
biscuit-making plant, a very acceptable
milk food can be produced.
Ordinary cane sugar and wheat
starch have been used to replace the
lactose so that the nutritive value of
the milk biscuit is fully equivalent to
whole milk. The biscuits can, indeed,
adequately replace milk in a child’s
diet provided, of course, that the child
is old enqugh to take solid food.
Seventy grammes (about 2£oz.) of the
biscuits equate with one pint of ordin-
ary cow’s milk. Moreover, they can
readily be fortified with vitamins and
minerals such as fluorine or iodine
which are deficient in certain areas.
Popular flavors such as chocolate,
vanilla, raspberry can be added and
savoury types, including cheese, could
also be prepared to satisfy local tastes
as required. '
Apart from their dietary importance
as a rich, digestible source of protein,
these biscuits have a long shelf life.
Under tropical conditions they will keep
for about a year without becoming
rancid or developing off-flavors. This
means that they could be distributed to
remote places lacking regular transport
or refrigeration. In the mouth they
resemble shortbread or many of the
common types of sweet biscuits. Since
these are beloved by children every-
where and in the East, especially, re-
garded as a prestige food, it seems
highly unlikely that the new milk bis-
cuits would be rejected by anyone.
Western mothers might well come to
prefer them for their children.
At this stage no information is avail-
able on the cost of manufacture, but
the scientists have pointed out that only
conventional equipment and processes
are involved. No additional capital in-
vestment should be necessary.


Potter in a
choir-loft
Pictures and text by MARY WHITE
SYDNEY POTTER Peter Travis has
his studio in the choir-loft above the old
Presbyterian Church in Palmer Street,
Woolloomooloo. To make himself a
thoroughly acceptable tenant, he plays
the organ for Sunday services.
Travis intended first to be a musician.
After leaving school he worked first in
a metallurgical laboratory, then obtained
a scholarship to study at the Sydney
Conservatorium of Music. He studied
the piano under Laurence Godfrey
Smith for five years; fellow students
included lan Wilson, Geoffrey Parsons,
Richard Bonynge, Richard Meale, and
Malcolm Williamson.
At the end of his course, sickness pre-
vented him from taking up teaching, so
he took a temporary position in a retail
store. During this time he wrote a panto-
mime, “Man in the Moon,” the first
performance of which coincided with
Russia’s first flight to the moon. He also
set the choruses of “The Trojan
Women” for the first performance ever
held at the Cell Block Theatre.
In time he found his temporary job
had stretched into seven years, for six
of which he was a buyer. He had, how-
ever, been going to the National Art
School four nights a week studying
design. He then became a designer,

designing and manufacturing teenage
clothing. Some of his radical designs
caught the attention of Boussac, the
financial force behind Christian Dior.
Travis was the first Australian to be
included among the international de-
signers who submit work to this firm.
Later he was in charge of the design
department of Speedo, sportswear
manufacturers. During a trip to Europe
for his firm he visited Valauris, where
everyone is a potter, but his interest in
ceramics had not yet been awakened.
He was also impressed by the tiles of
Salerno, in Italy, but it did not occur
to him then that he would one day
earn his living working in this medium.
After returning home, Travis re-
sumed classes at the National Art
School, this time in pottery. Finally,
he made a major decision, gave up his
jobs, and studied sculpture full time,
with a view to teaching art. He became
the first student to gain the new
ceramics certificate.
Travis had his first one-man show at
the Adelaide Festival in 1966. Critic
James Gleeson said the show was “one
of the unexpected delights of the Festi-
val.” In 1965 he began teaching
ceramics at the Mary White School of
Art and color theory at the Phyllis
Shillito School.
Like all pottery students, Travis was
immediately fascinated by the wheel
and managed to avoid the awkward
hand pottery until his final year as a
student. He then discovered the flexi-
bility of hand-building and its closeness
to sculpture. In all his work he finds
sensations similar to those he experi-
enced with music.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
“Art is a language”
By SANDRA HALL
“WHY DID I come back? That’s not
an easy question. I suppose I can only
say it was the call of the soil.”
Yvonne Audette, whose first Aus-
tralian exhibition opens at the Bonython
Gallery on February 26, was sitting in
the studio of her Rose Bay home, sur-
rounded by her paintings—paintings
which have evolved through 14 years
in New York and Europe. She has had
seven exhibitions in Florence, Milan,
Paris, Rome, and London, but, ironi-
cally, is almost unknown in her own
country.
“This exhibition is very important to
me—not only because I want to sell
but because I want to stay here now —
so I have to make sure I’m showing my
best work this time.”
She returned a little more than a
year ago, bringing a collection of paint-
ings which she planned to exhibit here,
but she has since done 43 more, so that
the Bonython exhibition (23 paintings
and 30 drawings and gouaches) will
span the past five or six years.
Dark-haired, fine-featured, and ex-
pressively intense about her work, she
studied at the Julian Ashton School and
the Sydney Technical College, then set
off for New York and a scholarship at
the National Academy. But it wasn’t
until she had left New York and its
abstract expressionist revolution that she
began to undergo one of her own.
She travelled through Europe, set up
a studio in the south of Spain, painting
figuratively all the time, then settled in
Italy. It was there that she began to
express the influences which had been
at work on her since her departure from
Australia.
“I found a good, inexpensive studio
in Florence, which made me feel fate
had decided I should live there for a
while and develop my work.
“I turned to abstracts because it was
the natural step to take after absorb-
ing all I had—everything from Giotto
to El Greco to Mondrian and Picasso.
Living in Florence didn’t provide the
influence, because Florence is very pro-
vincial as far as art is concerned. It is
full of aristocratic families so proud of
the traditional art around them that
they’re blind to what’s happening in
their own century.
“But I went to Paris and to Milan
quite often in fact, I lived there for
two years before coming back here.
“There’s a tremendous amount of in-
tellectual creativity in the north of
Italy. Fascism held them back for a
while, but now they’re surging
forward.” To Yvonne Audette, painting
is a continuous process (“it is with me
all the time”), and return to Australia
meant a disruption of the continuity.
She estimates it took her eight months
to accustom herself to “the rhythms of
Sydney,” but the compensation was a
certain independence of mind this city
gives her.
“We’re isolated here, which means
we can see things at a distance. There’s
not the same pressure about keeping
up-to-date as there is overseas. This is
something some of the young artists
here should realise.
“Another thing about this country is
that we are so close to nature. For me,
the bush symbolises the freedom of
spirit I talk about. It affects me, and
so comes out in my paintings, I sup-
pose.”
She finds it impossible to pinpoint
visible shapes or objects as inspirations.
“The unconscious is the thing which is
so much more important than anything
we look at consciously. I have a vision,
but it is not a final one. It exists only
like a distant image that I can’t grasp,
until it gets closer to me. Then it
becomes more mysterious, so I can
never really see it clearly enough. But
this is the way it must be. I would have
it no other way.”
At one time, she may be working
on as many as 10 paintings putting
them aside and reviewing them con-
tinually, perhaps for a year.
“During the time they are turned to
the wall, the brain washes over, so to
speak, and the over-intellectual facul-
ties are put aside. Then when they’re
taken up again I see it all in a new
way and I know what’s wrong.
“The more knowledgeable thing is
substituted for an inner vision which
takes over, giving out its own logic
and language.
“Art is a language not a demon-
stration of a particular idea.
“The sort of things inspired by tech-
nology are interesting, but they’re not
painting. The people who are working
this way may be discovering whole new
concepts, but they’re separate from the
painters.
“Painting is a way to commune with
the essential mystery behind all
things.”

Something
different-again
By CHARLES HIGHAM
WITH THE WORD “different”
printed boldly on his tie, Hollywood
producer-director Eddie Davis seemed
really to be giving us the mixture as
before when he announced last week
that he would be making “It Takes All
Kinds,” a story about an art theft from
the Art Gallery of New South Wales,
to be made on a low budget (about
$300,000) with American stars and Aus-
tralian cast and crew. But it looks as
though the contracts have been signed,
and by the end of February the film—
with a deferred sale-to-TV-network in
the U.S. and two years’ theatrical re-
lease ahead of that—will be shooting
on location in Sydney Harbor, the
Domain, and the main city streets.
The financing is unusual: Reginald
Goldworthy, a former actor who, with
his wife, runs a model school and
agency, represents a group of business-
men interested in financing Australian
films. They have put up the entire
capital, with guaranteed release from
BEF through Greater Union on a
better-percentage-than-usual - of - gross
deal. On the film’s completion, an
American company involved, an inde-
pendent outfit called Harold Goldman
Associates, will hand over half the
finance to Goldworthy’s board. Gold-
man will supply the stars, and, although
Goldworthy and Davis won’t mention
the network, we heard that NBC is
almost certain to tie the film up.
Goldworthy is aiming at continuity
of production, with 12 features planned,
including a life of Robert Louis Steven-
son in Samoa, and many of them will
be directed by Davis, who made most
of the TV sl(ow “Sea Spray” here. He
has just finished shooting “Panic in the
City,” with those two stalwarts of early
’fifties crime films, Howard Duff and
Stephen McNally, in the leads.
The Australian series may be a
compromise between film and TV (in
a pattern of films made for the box
now more or less standard in America)
and scarcely above the B-picture level,
but 12 productions a year is a start and
may start off a shoal of similar Holly-
wood-Australian low-budgeters in the
next two years.
No rich rewards
THE UNIVERSITY of New South
Wales Drama Foundation has ap-
proached its season of Australian plays,
which begins this week, with enthus-
iasm. However, there is one sad warn-
ing for aspiring playwrights. Rodney
Milgate has two plays in the season,
but it is still his paintings, not . his
plays, which enable Milgate and his
family to eat. So far, his first play, “A
Refined Look at Existence,” has earned
him $62.
The Foundation judged “A Refined
Look at Existence” as “the outstand-
ing success” of the Jane Street season
of Australian plays presented last year,
and commissioned Milgate’s second
play. He is an ex-actor and television
interviewer who gave up his job sev-
eral years ago to paint and write plays.
“The two complement one another,
really,” he said. “If I come to a block
in my painting, I start writing or vice
versa, and it usually helps. I’m working
at the same themes in both.”
Milgate’s second play, to be pre-
sented during the current season along
with a revival of “A Refined Look at
Existence,” is “At Least You Get Some-
thing Out of That,” which Professor
Robert Quentin describes as a “story
with Hell on one hand and a striptease
dancer on the other.”
A one-act play, “Norm and Ahmed,”
written by 23-year-old Alexander Buzo,
will be programmed with “Fire on the
Snow.” Mr. Buzo was a clerk with the
Education Department until he decided
to devote this year to writing. “I’ve got
quite a lot I’d like to do,” he said: “For
years I wanted to be a novelist, but I
gave the idea up and started working
at the New Theatre Workshop. I’ve
done one other play, which has been
staged' there.”
His play, to be directed by Jim
Sharman, is about a meeting between
an Asian student and a middle-aged
Australian. “It’s based on a real inci-
dent. I was drinking in a pub one day
with an Asian student I know when
this Australian came up to us and
started talking. At first everything was
fine, he was being very jovial, but
gradually he got nasty and turned on
the Asian.
“The play’s about the kind of menace
lurking beneath a situation like this.”
Integrated
"Beauty"
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Sleeping Beauty. Director, Kon-
stantin Sergeyev.
The Long Ride Home. Director, Phil
Karlson. ,
Bandit’s Revenge. Director, Francesco
Rosi.
THERE HAS NEVER been a truly
cinematic approach to classical ballet,
most ballet films being merely photo-
graphed records of theatrical perform-
ances. Even “Romeo And Juliet,”
though filmed in a proper film studio,
had a distinctly stagy look. But when
it was decided to film the Kirov Ballet’s
performance of “The Sleeping Beauty”
its ballet-master, Sergeyev, determined
to produce “not a filmed version of a
ballet but a motion-picture in its own
right . . . the art of dancing and the
art of cinematography are comple-
mentary.” A fine attitude, but, unfortu-
nately, Sergeyev, however much he
knows about ballet, isn’t exactly a
master of screen technique.
So his daring new approach boils
down to a few fancy camera-angles—
he’s particularly keen on looking down
on his dancers from the ceiling—and
some rather naive montage, mostly
involving shots of the Lilac Fairy super-
imposed on flowers, babbling brooks,
and so on. Apart from these tentative
excursions into experimentalism, the
whole thing looked awfully like a photo-
graphed stage performance to me.
Even as such, I found it less than
satisfactory. Sergeyev has seen fit to
“integrate”—the credit title’s word —his
own choreography with the accepted
Petipa version; which means that he’s
altered a good deal of it and cut the
rest. Only the first pas de deux of the
Bluebird variations, for instance, sur-
vives—which is a pity, since the dancers
looked pretty good—and Sergeyev’s
new choreography never seemed to me
any improvement and indeed quite
lacked the sparkle and freshness which
the Petipa version miraculously keeps
after three-quarters of a century.
By the way, this fairytale ballet has
an undertone of cynicism in its evalua-
tion of-good and evil; though Aurora
has a positive regiment of Good Fairies
cooing and showering blessings over her
cradle, it only takes one Carabosse to
throw a spanner into the works.
A capably made Western of the high-
minded type, “The Long Ride Home”
sometimes degenerates into a tract as
it rams home its message that war and
hatred too often suppress the innate
decency of humankind. The script-
writer, anxious lest we don’t get the
message, often afflicts his characters with
exchanges of dialogue straight from a
debating society. George Hamilton, as
the rabid Southerner who never intends
the Civil War to end, is particularly
hard done by in the writing of his part;
the role played by Glenn Ford has
more light and shade and therefore is
more believable.
Rosi’s “Salvatore Giuliano,” shown
here by film societies, has been given
an apologetic commercial release by
being dubbed, retitled “Bandit’s
Revenge,” and put on as supporting
feature to the above Western. It is still
very well worth seeing; the dubbing is
not as distracting as it might be, since
dialogue is the least important part of
the movie. Rosi’s approach to his sub-
ject avoids sentimentality and sensa-
tionalism, but evokes wonderfully the
explosive atmosphere of hate and bitter-
ness always just below the harsh and
arid surface of Sicilian life. Gianni di
Venanza’s superb black-and-white
camerawork makes the most of the
stony, dried-up countryside, with its
glaring sunlight and sharp black
shadows.


Engineering
achievement
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Northern Safari. Producer, Keith
Adams.
AUSTRALIA is truly the land of the
amateur. In recent weeks over 70,000
Victorians have crowded into town halls
to watch a 10-year-old, three-hour-long
home movie. Almost unbelievably, it
was written, directed, photographed,
recorded, and edited by a retired
engineer who’d never previously
operated a camera.
As well, he plays a leading role in
the drama, wrote the theme tune, reads
the narrative, hires the halls, helps with
the ushering, and projects the show on
portable equipment. Meanwhile, his co-
stars, wife Audrey and sister Margaret,
sell tickets and programs.
The film is a slow-moving yet wholly
absorbing account of a 9000-mile
expedition in a ’4B Buick—from Perth
across the Dead Heart to the Gulf of
Carpentaria, with a return journey
down the Western Australian coast. Its
rough edges endow the production with
such authenticity and authority that the
hall crawls with snakes, lizards, and
bush flies.
There are almost too many memor-
able images to remember. A beaten-up
old car crossing a red Martian dust-
scape towing an incongruous boat; the
cave where Lasseter languished; giant
lizards running absurdly on their hind
legs; the Adams family landing epic
sharks from the beach on handlines:
their fox terrier attacking emus, snakes,
and crocodiles, only to be vanquished
by an ant; alien herds of camels,
buffalo, and donkeys; and, appallingly,
a young Aboriginal girl with a face
deformed by a huge cancer, sitting in

children and a yellow dog.
In documenting the wildlife, Adams
leaves no stone unturned. Funnel-webs,
scorpions, and venomous snakes are
lovingly handled and displayed, and a
score of animals are disembowelled for
the furthering of our education. The
aspect of the film is a little disturbing,
as throughout it Adams uses the
slaughter of animals to provide gory
spectacle, as well as powerful argu-
ments for conservation. A case of two-
bob each way if ever I’ve seen one.
Adams is bitter with the lack of
interest show'n by business, Government,
and the Press in his achievement. He’s
convinced that without his stubborn-
ness and the help of w'ord-of-mouth
advertising the film would never have
been screened. So now, almost in
defiance, he’s taking it to America,
where he proposes to hire a theatre on
Broadway. With such a vivid record of
a garden older than Eden, he’ll have
little trouble in making a fortune.
Art
Run aground
By ELWYN LYNN
Juan Almoril. Macquarie, Sydney.
Jeffrey Makin. Watters, Sydney.
JUAN ALMORIL, a texture painter,
was born in Madrid in 1931 and came
to Australia in 1963, but has now run
aground on the iridescent mudflats of
texturology. There is a very awkw'ard
and treacherous terrain between the
quiet domains of Fontana and the
rugged dry lands of a Tapies. With
finesse and deliberated subtlety, Fon-
tana can glue glass to a canvas, pierce
it wdth bullet holes and ragged tears
and such is his nervous elegance that
there is no trace of spoliation or
carnality. Tapies., equally impatient with
the idolatry of the flat surface and Holy
Immaculate Picture Plane, with a
fetishistic ardor, gouges and lacerates
the surface so that, in his own words,
“dull, inert matter begins to speak with
incomparable expressive force,” and it
does this because the color and matiere
are one; color is not imposed on rugged
surfaces and the fissures and cracks look
as natural as Fontana’s simple incisions
in monochrome canvases. Fontana
destroys the flatness of the picture plane
with such intense decorativeness that
his holes and cuts look natural; Tapies
exploits the natural clumsiness of spon-
taneous creation from stolid material.
Almoril is not single-minded enough
and, with his series of paintings that
at first sight look like crusty-surfaced
armorial bearings, w'ants the best of
several worlds. Fie w'on’t give his verdi-
grised, dull brown and faded gold tex-
tures their independence from uncon-
vincing imitation of spades, wheels,
houses, fish, and caverns. His hues and
slices are so imposed on the thick sub-
stances that the material remains inert,
congested, and, to recall Tapies’ words,
tongue-tied.
Almoril does obtain some entrancing
passages of paint that recall ancient
walls, mossy caverns, and quiet, gloomy
caves, as in Lane Cove; his work is
full of beautiful secondary qualities like
the stained porosity in The Reform ,
but one misses the primary power. When
he does risk pure abstraction he is more
convincing and it ought to be clear
enough that non-representational areas
of impasto (like that on the forehead
of Rembrandt’s self-portrait in the Mel-
bourne Gallery) have a life of their
own and, without being inappropriate,
don’t have to be imitative. Mr. Al-
moril’s fellow Spaniards, Canogar,
Tapies, Feito, and Millares, who
created a mid-century textural revolu-
tion, are concerned not with eclecticism
and surface virtuosity but with some-
thing that will have to be vague: a
message.
Jeffrey Makin has no ideological mes-
sages, but has some quiet, artistic ones;
where Almoril is vulgar and ostenta-
tious, Makin is reserved, firm, and mild
(as no doubt befits the amateur
wrestling champion of Australia, for
that is what he is in his spare time)
and he has a gentle hold on his squares,
oblongs, and triangles that he arranges
in patterns akin to those of Klee and
de Stael. Some of his recent figurative
oils are composed from (not imposed
upon, as is the case with Almoril) flat
areas somewhat in the manner of Keith
Vaughan, who, with English sang-froid
took the angst out of Cezanne and de
Stael.
Makin is likewise little concerned with
expressive power: his balance of shapes
is almost always a visual rather than
an emotional matter and Warrior I is
an almost perfect orchestration of
small, bright oblongs mounting some
irregular forms that cut into black at
the top and sink with a sharp edge
of orange into dark green below'. Here,
and elsewhere, he has an excellent
sequential, control of shapes, and, less
raggedly divisionist than Vaughan, tries
to preserve the wholeness of areas
sometimes patterning cruciform shapes
with varied reds in City of Night or
with sour green and shadowed lemon-
yellow oblongs in Babel 11.
These have an unforced solidity, an
ease of movement from square to square
that is at its best in Babel I, where the
rigidity of form is quite destroyed by
the slow flow and expansion of simple
areas. His concern with ease, in this
fine debut, is further exemplified in his
Print Releases, so called because part
of them consists of solvent transfers
from newsprint; these he allows to w'aft
up from vaporous grey squares with
Marshal Ky appearing momentarily
and Rubens’ plump nudes melting into
thin air. Girlie in Pink uses a couple of
arrow's, and, like arrows used sensibly in
painting, they indicate not movement
but where the action is. Makin’s action
is not big league, but real art-action is
going on without drums and banners.


BOOKS
No new light in the dark
corners
By ALEXANDER CRAIG
Australian Poetry 1967. Edited by
Max Harris. Angus & Robertson.
$1.95.
MAX HARRIS IS so well known today
as a combination of literary gossip-
columnist, book-promoter, art-show-
opener, self-advertised professional Aus-
tralian (a kind of Rolf Harris in print),
also as a TV comedian in his own
right, a self-appointed Press secretary
to Mr. Don Dunstan, and a booster for
Adelaide tourism, that it’s being rapidly
forgotten that he was once a poet of
extraordinary and exciting promise. He
was the leader of an avant-garde
movement in the mid-19405, a critic
of occasional, illuminating intuitions
and insights during the early 19505.
Remembering these far-off things, I’d
hoped (against hope) that, when Mr.
Harris became its editor, we might see
a more surprising, alive “Australian
Poetry” anthology than we’ve been
used to for a long time. However, Mr.
Harris, after about three months’ edit-
ing, complained in “The Australian”
that current Australian poetry’s dull.
I suppose this was fair warning. “Aus-
tralian Poetry 1967,” anyway, is one
of the dullest, most unadventurous, and
most conservative collections ever to
appear under the Angus & Robertson
imprint.
This small book also advertises a
kind of poetic justice: because of its
timing, it bears also the ricochet-marks
of two of Harris’ own recent bullets
from his fortress in “The Australian.”
Early this year, he patronised Kenneth
Slessor with the words “Beaut old
Chap . . . Wouldn’t say that the con-
temporary literary idiom is really his
thing these days,” at the same time
attacking James McAuley as the
“Author of ‘The End of Modernism’
and an implacable opponent of non-
traditional literary forms.” On the
evidence of “Australian Poetry 1967,”
an immense gulf separates Harris him-
self from the language and direction
of what’s actually happening in the
urbanised landscape of current poetry;
and Professor McAuley would have
little trouble producing an anthology
at least as up to date as Harris’. Still
occasionally proclaiming and fre-
quently implying his championship of
avant-gardists, Harris really shows
little or no awareness, certainly no
understanding, of the truly contem-
porary, idiomatic diction, imagery, and
economic flexibility of form which a
number of poets today are attempting.
He displays Geoffrey Dutton’s dated,
sprayvling, autobiographical alexandrines
(four pages of them!) — 1 appallingly
slack, lacking any sort of poetic in-
tensity and compactness.
To give just three instances and
among the younger men two out-
standing poems by Andrew Taylor,
several rhythmically interesting, suc-
cessful experiments by B. A. Breen, and
a few poems with fresh, fluid, coales-
cing images by Tim Bass were published
just before and during the months when
Harris was putting this anthology to-
gether. “Previous publication,” as
Angus & Robertson say, “is no bar to
acceptance.” If these and like poets
didn’t submit typescripts, I’m quite
sure that this publisher wouldn’t have
stopped an editor from writing to poets
for work he had seen in print and liked.
Most Australian poetry still belongs
stylistically and formally either to the
English Georgian period or, with shifts
in tone and a few half-rhymes, to the
poetry most fashionable in England
during the early and mid-19305; rela-
tively more “modern” printed verse
derives from American poetry between
the late ’twenties and (more rarely) the
early ’forties. Usually, the “Australian
Poetry” anthologies—Harris’ being no
exception —faithfully reflect this state
of affairs. Nevertheless, poems were
available with a bursting energy, a
controlledpporer,w r er, a lyric incisiveness
that might have floodlit the darker
corners of the “current” anthology. He
includes only Norman Talbot and
Roger McDonald from the newer poets.
They certainly try for a more flexible
movement than do most other contri-
butors, but it’s partly vitiated by one or
two threadbare, traditional epithets and
phrases, a few hackneyed images—even
(in McDonald’s short, second poem) by
an unfortunate, very “poetic” inversion.
Talbot’s “The Hare’s Eye” ends rela-
tively flatly, like some short thesis; but
McDonald’s poem on Emily Dickinson,
the better of his pair, rises to an appro-
priate, presageful climax:
The poems climb in their packets:
The boy sings by the burying-ground,
Afraid.
Harris includes one excellent poem
by Gwen Harwood about a religious re-
vival-meeting, fusing a riotous “gloomy
humor” and a kind of nightmare
imagery with realism and a profound
insight into human longings: this poem
effloresces above a traditional stanzaic
and metrical framework which never
draws attention to itself for its own
sake. Ironically, the most contemporary
poem is J. M. Couper’s slightly updated
version of the Anglo-Saxon “Seafarer,”
competing with Ezra Pound’s well-
known paraphrase, because of its col-
loquial immediacy, its functional buoy-
ancy and sweep of dark feeling. W.
Hart-Smith’s first poem is a fairly good
one in his characteristic manner (his
second’s merely an Imagist exercise).
“Shorelines,” by Les A. Murray—a poet
who hasn’t previously impressed me
suggests Hart Crane’s quatrains in “The
Max Harris . . . little awareness
River” and “Dance” sections of “The
Bridge”: even his images occasionally
read like Australianised adaptations of
Crane’s. Crane’s poetry, of course, be-
longs mainly to the American ’twenties,
but it’s good to find a poet with some-
thing like his verve in this curiously
static collection. Douglas Stewart pro-
vides one of the rare examples of
Hope’s “discursive mode” appropriately
used, a lightweight poem but not pre-
tending to be anything else; the femi-

nine rhymes and half-rhymes are
adroitly managed; the pentameters
possess a litheness and jauntiness (they

poem, formal in its diction, marred by
a couple of capitalised abstractions
(even allowing for possible irony), is, I
suppose, an academic poem, a little
Audenesque and like some “New Lines”
pieces of the late ’fifties, but it carries a
conviction and an authority which to-
gether with its good images lift it
above many of the other poems. Bruce
Dawe’s second and third poems are all
right, but his first one and Robert D.
Fitzgerald’s Vietnam piece are, however
sincere, merely versified propaganda,
not poetry. Fitzgerald’s “The Road
North,” though better, is two pro-
saically discursive, too much given to
explaining itself.
A. D. Hope, Evan Jones, R. A. Simp-
son, and those uneven poets Charles
Higham and Vivian Smith are hardly
seen at their best (though far above
Harris’ worst items). R. F. Brissenden
not generally known as a poet
offers an interesting biographical sketch
of Dr. Johnson, in the form of a sonnet.
David Campbell’s double-sonnet has a
freshness that almost reinvigorates
classical mythology. There are middling
poems by Bruce Beaver and Philip
Martin (his mainly marred by a poor
close). Jill Hellyer’s “Calculating
Female” would be shrewd and delight-
ful but for a certain flatness of language
and some reliance on cliches.
The remaining poems range from
bad to very bad. Robert Clark’s is par-
ticularly banal. Rosemary Dobson’s very
Georgian poem has one good penta-
meter—“only the thin attrition of blown
sand” but includes nineteen others.
Rodney Hall’s half-page holds a. thin,
mannered trio of dimeter quatrains
about rooks in a wheatfield. Geoffrey
Lehmann’s “Kiev Waiting for the
Mongol Hordes” relies on a medley of
two dozen trimeters, tetrameters, and
particularly flabby pentameters all
in a flat, lifeless diction, with cliches
and stock poeticisms at the most
strategic points. The old poetic Adam
dies hard in Professor McAuley, in
spite of reactionary poetic mayhem: his
“sun’s silver stare” looks precisely
right in its immediate context; his
sunlight’s “soft hilarity on hair and
skin” and “voltage of pale sunshine”
are good images in his second poem;
but both pieces are rhythmically and
formally uninteresting (the first being
very stiff and awkward) and too
concerned to make their moral points.
Craig Powell’s “Villanelle” isn’t saved
by one good image: he says, “There is
a time and language to renew” and
that “words are there and have their
work,” but his own language here is
largely second-hand and doesn’t work.
Eric C. Rolls’ single worthwhile image
closing “Kama” is spoilt by one of his
inappropriately weak rhymes, by his
singsong “Shearer’s Dream” couplets
and neo-Georgian diction. David Row-
botham overworks his simple candle
metaphor (inspecting it almost mawk-
ishly from every angle) before snuff-
ing it out, at last, in his labored penta-
meter couplets to Henry Lawson.
Thomas W. Shapcott’s “Mr. Cage”
begins very well but degenerates to a
stereotyped handling of its last scene.
The poverty of John Thompson’s
language and his rhythm throughout
“Street Scene” ruins a good poetic idea
in his final quatrain: so do the personi-
fied abstractions that might have earned
him a footnote as a mid-18th-century
minor poet. I’m sorry that Judith
Wright’s poem is so very bad senti-
mental, with hackneyed images, a bald,
flat conclusion, the whole movement
wooden because her work over a
long period has represented one of the
peaks of Australian poetry.
Fringe-nibblers
By SAM LIPSKI
Politics of the Extreme Right. Warrin-
gah, 1966. R. W. Connell and
Florence Gould. Sydney University
Press. $2.50.
UNTIL RECENTLY, the really inter-
esting political events, developments,
and personalities in Australia did not
seem to hold very much interest for
Australian political scientists. This was,
and is, especially true of politics on the
fringe. All the more reason to wel-
come this study by two young political
scientists from the University of Sydney.
They write as if politics in Australia
can be at least as interesting as those
of Chad or Burma.
“Warringah 1966” combines a
theoretical analysis and background
account of the extreme Right gener-
ally in Australia with a discussion of
the political campaign in the Sydney
electorate of Warringah during the
Federal elections of 1966. It was here
that the extreme Right made its first
concerted effort at the polls in an
attempt to defeat or weaken the
endorsed Liberal candidate, Mr. E. H.
St. John.
The authors see the extreme Right
in Australia not as a completely alien
group but one which shares many of
its beliefs with “more moderate con-
servatives.” In this view what dis-
tinguishes the extreme Right is that
their “political opinions on certain
important topics are at the extreme
of the spectrum.” The most impor-
tant topic is anti-Communism. And the
intensity of their obsessive anti-Com-
munism not only distinguishes the ex-
treme Right from their colleagues but
is the one element which all the dis-
parate organisations on the extreme
end of the continuum have in common.
Two comments: first, the obsessive
anti-Communism. This is certainly the
sine qua non of all extreme groups in
Australia, but it is often ritualistic and
not always the dominant element in
their attitude patterns. The writers
have paid too little attention, for in-
stance, to the anti-Semitic and racialist
obsessions of the great majority of the
far Right. Thus the extreme Eastern
European emigres are certainly anti-
Communist, but they carry on their in-
digenous anti-Semitism. The concern
with apartheid and Rhodesia among
the Cilentos and the Butlers stems as
much from their racialist views and
fantasies about black people as it
does from their anti-Communism.
Where anti-Communism would pre-
sumably have dictated support for
Israel in the June War, “Australian
International News Review” and other
far Right publications were attacking
“Zionism” and using similar language
to rat on the Soviet UN delegate, Mr.
Fedorenko, who specialised in com-
parisons between Jews and Nazis.
The second comment is related. It
is not only that anti-Communism
seems to have lost much of its relevance
as a distinguishing criterion for the
Right-Left continuum it is the con-
tinuum approach itself which leaves
me unsatisfied. Certainly, the spec-
trum or continuum view makes it
much easier for political scientists to
measure “political attitudes.” Since
today they must quantify or perish,
this is one way of trying to under-
stand extreme political behaviour. Its
weakness is that it does not tell us
very much about the essential and
politically crucial difference between
a man like Eric Butler and W. C.
Wentworth to argue that on anti-
Communism they are much the same,
only Eric Butler is more so. Is it
too unscientific to see in political be-
haviour cut-off points where the
quality of behaviour and outlook
changes as we get to the extremes, and
we find ourselves talking about a dif-


Graham Kerr says:
It only takes
genius to make
the perfect
omelette.
Clarified butter
helps.
Clarified butter, as you know, is simply pure
dairy butter with the water, salt and curd
removed. Because it has no moisture it
doesn’t splutter and foam when it’s melted.
It won’t catch or burn. But the smallest
amount of it (just enough to cover the bottom
of the pan) will bring out the subtle flavour
of an omelette, for example, in a way nothing
else can. Try this recipe and prove it for
yourself. You don't have to be a genius to
appreciate the difference Clarified Butter
makes to cooking just perceptive.
1 oz. clarified butter
2 tabs, water
pinch salt, cayenne pepper
2 eggs
Filling
1 small tomato
1 tab. vinegar
1 tab. cultured sour cream
2 oz. cottage cheese
1 tab. chopped chives
Method: Cut tomato into eight
pieces; marinate in sour cream
and vinegar 30 mins. Combine
drained tomato with cottage
cheese and chives.
Melt clarified butter in omelette
pan. Add water, salt and pepper to
eggs and beat. Pour into pan and
cook until set, gently moving the
centre to cook the omelette
evenly. Place filling on half the
surface and fold in two. Serve
immediately. Serves 1.
Clarified Butter (also sold as Ghee or Butter
Oil) may be purchased at all the best food
stores. If you have trouble obtaining it, or if
you’d like our recipe leafet, write to The

NATURE 8 FINEST
ferent sort of anti-Communism, not just
more of it?
Apart from these differences of
emphasis, I found the study provided
a great deal of new and valuable
material on how the extreme Right
works, who they associate with in the
Liberal Party and the DLP, how they
co-operate with one another, and their
differing emphases on matters like
Rhodesia, apartheid, and Vietnam. An
important and valuable distinction is
made between the “extremist” Right
in the tradition of European Fascists
or some of the American groups who
aim to overthrow democratic institu-
tions, and the “extreme” Right,
which, for the time being at least, is
content to operate within the frame-
work of Australia’s social and poli-
tical institutions. This means that
the handful of deviates who call
themselves Nazis are not mentioned in
the book. This is how it should be.
They may be interesting case studies,
but are politically irrelevant in Aus-
tralia.
What about the campaign in Warrin-
gah? The authors conclude that War-
ringah was a defeat for the extreme
Right and showed that there were
definite limits to how far the movement
could nibble at the fringes of the
Liberal Party before being isolated and
rebuffed. A useful analysis of the voting
figures suggests that the extreme Right
vote as distinct from the vote for the
candidate supported by the extreme
Right was about five percent of the
total vote in Warringah. Considering
the conservatism of the electorate, one
would expect a national percentage to
be even smaller.
The baffling thing in this section of
the book was the way the writers (or
whichever writer was more respon-
sible) lost their academic cool when
it came to assessing St. John. Some-
times they write as if they feel uncom-
fortable with a man who genuinely
does oppose extremism of both Left and
Right. Whatever the reason, St. John
is variously described as “self-
righteous,” showing “rigidity,” politic-
ally “unsophisticated,” lacking . in
“verve,” hypersensitive to criticism.
None of the other candidates fare quite
so badly at the hands of the authors.
Apart from this sort of labelling,
for which the book presents little or
no evidence, there are criticisms of
St. John as made by others involved
in the campaign. Some are out-
rageous ones made by the far Right,
and some are plain bitchy ones made
by Liberal Party colleagues peeved
at St. John’s maverick style. [He is,
after all, a classic Liberal, as the authors
rather grudgingly acknowledge.] The
criticisms are repeated, but rarely is
there any ' attempt to assess their
validity. For instance, when St. John
finally went to court to prevent the
defamatory campaign against him from
being carried into every house in the
Connell . . . assessing St. John
electorate via the local newspaper, and
won his case, there were, according
to the book, charges that he was try-
ing to muzzle his political opponents.
But who made these charges? Is
this really what St. John was trying
to do? We are not told. This seeming
nonchalance is unexpected in an
academic study.
Since the book’s publication, St.
John has claimed that apart from one
interview on his preselection, the
authors never discussed the campaign
or any of its aspects with him, nor did
he see the manuscript before publica-
tion. In itself, writing a book about
a political campaign without inter-
viewing the central figure may not
result in a lopsided account, but, on
this occasion, however, it goes fairly
close.
One final comment about St. John’s
political capabilities seems appro-
priate. Watching him throughout
that campaign in Warringah, I saw him
learn politics very fast. He may have
started off green, but by the end of the
campaign he had learned more than
many a politician will pick up in a
lifetime. If he was as naive and un-
skilled as the authors suggest, it cer-
tainly did not show when he played
a crucial role in getting a second Royal
Commission on the Voyager disaster.
Not a bad display of “verve” for a
backbencher of barely three months.

SOMETHING
NEW
WITH GRAHAM KERR
Learn to cook the
way Henry Ford
made cars
COOKING ISN’T really difficult, yet
it seems that the harder food writers
try to bring simplicity to the kitchen
the worse the phobia becomes for some
people who go on insisting “I’m just
not a good cook.” Yet there are only
obvious physical limitations —like lack-
ing a sense of taste or smell—to stop
anyone from cooking well.
Cooking, like most things in this life,
requires an interest and some self-
discipline to get on the right track.
As a guide to better cooking I would
say the first requirement is organisation.
Without it you must fail, with it you
will soon get the interest that sparks
the creative instinct of the “good cook.”
Preparing a dish can be likened to
building a motor-car. It can be custom-
made without restriction on time or
cost. To attempt such a “Rolls-Royce”
project before grasping fundamentals is
to court disaster. It is far better to
adopt the Henry Ford technique: make
a dish the production-line way
organise its preparation so that you
eliminate error, cut time and cost.
You may imagine that I’m bringing
an “art” form down to an impossibly
crude commercial basis, so let me
recount a personal experience. In 1958
I took over as Chief Catering Advisor
to the Royal New Zealand Air Force,
whose kitchens left a lot to be desired.
The cooks simply lacked interest and
the food standard fell accordingly. My
aim was to increase the quality of the
cooked food; in other words, to make
my cooks good cooks.
I did this by offering an incentive.
Obviously, in a Government establish-
ment you cannot hang out financial
carrots, give a bonus or extra leave. The
incentive was simply based upon giving
them the opportunity to buy exotic
foods, crayfish, turkey, anything they
fancied, provided that they cut costs.
The carrot was increased variety and
this meant a better menu standard. It
worked. But what I set out to achieve,
to make them better cooks, worked even
better. In order to save money they
had to eliminate waste. By far the
greatest waste in the kitchen takes place
through overcooking. Overcooked food
is poor food. The logical result was that
every cook was careful—he made sure
that oven-roasted meats were cooked at
the right temperature and removed when
just done and vegetables were crisp.
Mundane and commercial—not a bit
of it. It was exciting, creative, and
interesting.
All very well for 4000 meals a day,
but how about relating it to the average
household. All cooking starts from a
basic plan, the recipe, which is a model
of clear, concise direction.
I have been creating recipes for 16
years. Each dish that I use on television,
radio, in the Press or magazines, or that
I include in my books has been tested
at least three times. The need for test-
ing is to achieve the best possible
balanced taste. But I can only use my
own sense of taste; like any author of
recipes I can only hope that my taste
will be compatible with yours, yet it
doesn’t always follow. Just as I cannot
prejudge your palate, you cannot pre-
judge mine. You have to give the recipe
a go—as written —and then make notes
in the margin on your own attitude to
change ready for the next time you
attempt it. If you do change the recipe
at the first time of preparation, then
the result is your own, not mine. It
could, of course, be an improvement.
Just because Henry Ford put his engine
in the front didn’t stop Volkswagen
from putting theirs in the back!
If it is your decision to follow the
recipe. v then first scan the list of
ingredients and do not attempt a dish
if any single item is not in your cup-
board. Frequently water is used in lieu
of stock, a bayleaf is simply left out,
and substitutes for fresh garlic are used.
There is no way in which substitutes
can reproduce what the author origin-
ally created. ‘ When all ingredients are
at hand, they must be weighed or
measured accurately. Half a teaspoon
of cayenne is spicy, 1 teaspoon may be
a disaster.
Preparation is vital if you are to
enjoy cooking. You must prepare every
ingredient to a stage where it is ready
for the pan or saucepan. Onions peeled
and sliced, garlic peeled, meat or fish
trimmed or filleted, flour sifted, parsley
chopped. All this is essential and must
never be left to be done while the dish
is being “cooked.” Imagine what would
happen on a production line if the gear-
box hadn’t been assembled by the time
the car reached that point—chaos!
You now have all the right in-
gredients, weighed, measured, and pre-
pared ready for the pot. All you have
to do is put them together in accord-
ance with the sequence and times given
so that the dish arrives at its completed
stage just before you eat. This I must
stress —you must adjust your start time
so that whatever dish you cook is
finished when it is time to eat. So often
food is ready an hour before service,
ready to get served, limp and un-
appetising.
I am certain that if you select six
recipes today and undertake to prepare
them as I have suggested, you will by
the sixth effort suddenly enjoy yourself,
and from that moment on your enjoy-
ment will lead you on to be a
thoroughly interested and creative cook.

Pleasures of Malta
The article “Mintoff amongst the
Maltese” (8., Jan. 20) is most interest-
ing and readable, but I am sorry that
a paragraph concerning Malta gives a
completely erroneous picture compared
with its undoubted charm and quite
bearable summer and winter.
It is unfair to say of a climate which,,
while certainly justifying the modern
amenities in summer of air-conditioning,
has attracted 170,000 tourists during
these past two years, that its “soil is
scorched brutally” by the sun.
Small it may be, but because of this
—unlike the torrid Mallee and the
Western plains—it .has available within
easy access to all the advantage of safe,
crisp sea water. Its agricultural areas,
protected by its varied sensible strongly
built stone walls, and constituting 45
percent of its 120 square miles, is at
present as green as Ireland. From June
it will be brown like the Victorian
Western District plains in January.
An Australian’s reaction to “almost
treeless” would envisage the aboreal
emptiness of the Nullarbor Plains.
Malta has a change and contrast of
city and countryside in aspect through-
out its four seasons, which, allied with
its historical background, makes it a
most unique and fascinating island for
resident and visitor. It admittedly has
its personal problems which, throughout
the years, have created the necessity for
emigration but the least of the motiva-
tions for leaving is any antipathy toward
this country as a desirable place in
which to live.

Masons and Catholics
The growing tolerance between Masons
and Catholics is not going to hold
much interest for the new breed of
dinkum Aussies.
Freemasonry, particularly in its secret
society aspect, is almost the complete
anachronism in this world of instant
communication with L.B.J. and Ho Chi
Minh in our sitting-rooms.
While Roman Catholicism occupies
its immeasurably greater sphere than
Freemasonry, yet it somewhat resembles
the latter in respect to a privileged and
self-perpetuating hierarchy given to
secret conclave.
It can be confirmed by campfire
candor and bottle party ear-bashing
that the great majority of rank-and-file
Aussies have a deep, if somewhat


inarticulate, respect for the pristine and
egalitarian Christian mateship which is
the real church or ecclesia.
For this, as well as other reasons,
Freemasonry as at present constituted
has a declining future in Australia.
What Luther stated in Roman
Catholicism is slowly and painfully but
with increasing momentum still being
worked out mainly by the lower orders.

Lee's lapse
So Singapore’s Prime Minister, Lee
Kuan Yew (8., Jan. 27), now read>
Bloodhound brochures at night instead
of Plato and Socrates.
It would appear that he is making
the same mistake as most of the other
world leaders. More sane philosophy
and less preoccupation with armaments
would be the surest way to world peace.
Or maybe, after reading “Iron Moun-
tain,” we shouldn’t be worried about
war.

The Gallup Poll
The letter (8., Feb. 3) by Roy
Morgan of the Australian Gallup Poll
in no way changes my view that both
The Bulletin correspondent (8., Dec.
16) and the Gallup Poll organisation
were wrong in claiming that the result
of the May Nexus Referendum had
been “predicted with complete
accuracy.”
The actual result of the Nexus Refer-
endum was 60 percent for No; the
final qualified forecast of the Gallup
Poll was 55 percent —a difference of
5 percent which does not constitute
complete accuracy.
It is clear that the Gallup Poll or-
ganisation should have concluded its
analysis and article immediately after
the distribution of the 16 percent, in-
stead of introducing three arguments
as to why the result would not be 60
percent but 55 percent for No.

Non-occasion comment
It is difficult to understand The Bulle-
tin’s petulance at the non-appearance
of Acting President Suharto and Prince
Sihanouk at the Holt Memorial Ser-
vice. It is also difficult to see why
these leaders needed to interpret Mr.
McEwen’s statements as they did.
Let’s face it if Sihanouk had
wanted to attend the Memorial Service
to a man with whom he had “got on
so handsomely” he could have, without
sacrificing his neutrality. He needn’t
have gone within 100 miles of the Can-
berra Rex.
Likewise Suharto, although perhaps
a lesson derived from the unhappy
experience of President Nkrumah may
have made him glad of an excuse to
stay at home.
They could have come, and the fact
that they didn’t is of little importance.
So perhaps the non-occasion prize
should go to the journal which made
the unnecessary attack on Mr. McEwen
when he was carrying out a most dif-
ficult task with rugged dignity.

Defending Sir Alex
It is bad enough for your writer
“Observer” to describe Britain (in
her relationship with Australia) as “just
another country” (8., Jan. 27), but to
speak of Sir Alex Downer as an
“amateur” and “untalented” seems to
me to be both insulting and rude. He is,
after all, the accredited High Commis-
sioner to Britain and may, like many
diplomats, have much to learn, but
“Observer’s” whole article reeks of anti-
British feeling. Britain is still the centre
of the British Commonwealth and not
only the monarchy but numerous insti-
tutions, trade agreements, migration,
language and system of government, to
mention but a few, make Britain, in
regard to Australia, far more than “just
another country.”
But I suspect that Sir Alex’s remarks
favoring a strong and resurgent British
Commonwealth which could and, I am
sure, despite your thoughtless remarks,
will play a constructive role in world
affairs, are the reason for such an
article.
Of course Sir Alexander Downer has
spoken out strongly against the attempt
to take Britain into the Common
Market, remarks which did gain
prominence in sections of the British
Press. British public opinion, despite
places like the Foreign Office, which for
years harbored Communist spies, will
have the final say in the country. The
“I’m Backing Britain” movement is
only the start.

Lakemba, N.S.IV.
The trouble with abstract
There are three points in Mr. Lynn’s
review (8., Jan. 22) of Franz Philipp’s
book on Arthur Boyd which I feel de-
serve some attention. The first refers
to the passage where Mr. Lynn says,
“. . . it is the first book to elevate a
living painter to historical importance
. . .” Much as Mr. Lynn may believe
in the powers of the critic, surely he is
a little grasping to assume such power
for an art historian?
The second point refers to Mr.
Lynn’s words “. . . female, wispy ecto-
plasm . I . being watched by mongrel
brutes . . . evokes the primeval mud and
mist.” The words “ectoplasm,” “brute,”
“primeval mud and mist” seem laugh-
ably pretentious used in this way. If
one looks at Boyd’s painting, or even a
reproduction of it, one could convinc-
ingly say “female, wispy current sex
symbol, with disproportionately large
head, veil, and red hair, being watched
by mongrel dog.”
The third point refers to part of Mr.
Lynn’s reference to The Antipodean
Manifesto of 1959, “Well, were Sydney-
siders so harsh? Did they say anything
so intolerant as that abstraction was
ultimately headed for ‘the silence of
decoration’?” Well, Mr. Lynn, what has
abstract painting, or its critics or apolo-
gists said, since 1959, which makes that
statement harsh? Abstract art may do
some good by making people aware of
their simple, physical visual reactions;
the bell is rung by shape, color, texture,,
etc.
This sort of knowledge is shared by
artists, designers, decorators, advertisers,
etc. For the artist to make abstraction
the central core of his contribution is
to relegate himself to a secondary role
in the arts, to try to usurp that of
designer or decorator. It actually unfits
him to be a painter, whose function it
is to take the lead in the change and
development of images.
Mr. Lynn may not regard this as
important, but as we use images in
thinking and are continually exposed
to them, their understanding and
development are of considerable value.

Don't be caught with a machine-shaped system
when you could have a system-shaped machine.
We’ll talk to you about accounting machines if you
wish, but we’d much sooner discuss what you want
out of your accounting system. That way, you’ll get a
system tailored to your needs and an NCR machine
tailored to your system. And you’ll avoid the risk of
installing an accounting machine which expects you to
adapt your procedures to its capabilities.
When you buy an NCR data processing system you get
more than just the hardware. A vital part of every NCR
installation is the supporting software. (The term “soft-
ware” describes all the supporting services a manu-
facturer of “hardware” supplies to customers.) It’s
designed to ensure that NCR machines handle applica-
tions efficiently. It’s tailored to help solve customer
problems, to simplify installation, and to facilitate
training of users. The term is relatively new but the
concept is not; NCR has placed strong emphasis on
such services for many years.
Because NCR has always stressed a systems approach
to business problems rather than a machine approach,
we can offer today many advanced customer aids.
NCR Data Processing representatives are known as
systems specialists because they are trained in good
business methods as well as in equipment capabilities.
They are backed by the accumulated experience and
ideas of NCR Systems Research teams, who in turn
have access to world-wide NCR experience gained
through operations in over 100 countries.
