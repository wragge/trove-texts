the New South Wales Political
Situation.
, Po trace the origin of tho unhealthy condi-
Wtmj’bf public opinion which has prevailed in
>' ftfrr South Wales for many years and formed
' jhfr matrix of political ovil, ono would have
to make an excursion into history somewhat
. . remote ; but it is sufficient to start with the
* period when Sir Henry Parkes contrived to
• divide the poople inro two bitterly hostile
- eitnps. The seeds of confusion aiul corrup-
" itofi qnickly germinated in the soil thus pre-
jmnkL Designing men hastened to secure
."their'own wretched little ends, whilst the
Y-SUmos were kept thinking only of religious
rdjnefoncea, ana the general election which
gave Parkbs and Robertson their quietus
gave tho country an Assembly compoaod
n»o*tly of knaves and inoapables. Tho ad-
, YVeot of Mr. Stuart afforded ground for high
hopes ; but unfortunately the health of that
gentleman failed, and the country was left to
the mercy of Mr. Dallky, whose sole idea
to show that tho Orange party
Pjjßp'ttot a monopoly of that “ loyalty to tho
•VfSovereign " of wnich so much absurd talk has
teen heard. While Mr. Dalley was law-
faealy wasting his country’s substance ovor
military enterprises, all sorts and conditions
pf thievos wore dipping into tho Treasury
and bringing on tho financial catachysm that
, now overwhelmed the oommunity. Tho
of tho regime of Dallby and
ifj/KBB is now nc^ 5 —a matter of contro-
'"Wr7- When oske. - cf- what fund tho

rjSad,thesepoliticiansanswered. “Outof the.
; iurplus revenue!” It is to-day a proved fact
Vtfcafc when Parliament was told this there
was not only no surplus, but an actual deficit
Ipformidable proportions, and a prospective
deficit calculated to alarm a capable Govorn-
. into taking precautionary measures.
•'VjjWSKnataad of rushing into costly, sonseloss,
unlawful enterprises, the Ministry of
' tlpkt day had engaged at once in systematic
3$ jifrenohmont of the expenditure, theoountry
would not now be driven to its wits' ends to
tvert bankruptcy. J v \\ .
the last Assembly was bad
in oveiy point of view that takes in tho
Woll-bemg of the ooontry. It possessed no
legislative capacity, no financial acumen, no
critical insight into publio affairs, no honesty
of purpose. It psAsed a Land Act which is
an egregious fiaaoo, and a Criminal Law Con-
solidation and Amendment Act which is a
disgrace and a '.srror, we will not say to
' civilisation, but to absolute humanity. For
the rest it did nothing beyond registering
and endorsing measures involving unparal-
leled extravagance of expenditure and
sickening corruption. How far the present
House i: *»» improvement on its predecessor
is hard, to determine. The deficit be-
queathed to it was one million. It is now
threo millions and a half. The inference
hero deducible is that the Assembly just on
the eve of being sent about its business ex-
tolled tho House of 1882. It has at all
‘ Events tolerated au administration which
has exhibited noarly all the vioes
of tho Dallky-Dibbn coterie with none
of their virtues and strength. The
dnd of the Jbnninos Government was
worthy of its career. The stery of the fall-
ing-out between the ex-Prime Minister and
Mr. Dibbs shows tho utter incapacity of
these men cb manage even a quarrel with
dexterity. Wo suppose there is no other
ciso on record where two Cabinet Ministers
•oolded each other publicly as thoee two in-
dividuals have dono. Wherever it has become
j£wN^!id y Kd/brn, the
positions of-, the writers being analagous,
their publication has been reserved for a
fitting season, when the writers had ceased
to have tho onus oast upon them of uphold-
ing the dignity of the country. Like a
couple of nshfaga, however, the ex-Primo
Minister and his most important colleague
must needs rush into the market-place to
have out slanging-match, aud thus dis-
grace not only themselves—that is nothing— I
but tho oolony as a whole. This truly is par
excellence the sge of outrages.
The puerile and ludicrous means
adoptod by the ex-Premior to rid himself of a
contumacious and unworkable colleague in-
dicate ignorance of the very gjphabot of
politics. His duty was to demand the dis-
missal of Mr. Dibbs as an alternative to re-
signing offioe himself. Mr. Dibbs would not
have been the first Australian Minister
gazetted out of office under like circumstances
to those that have lately transpired. But
possibly Sir Patrick JenninoS, after a pro-
oess of severe introspection, concluded tho
country would derive some advantage from
the removal of himself as well as Mr. Dibbs.
And here we are disposed to inquire touch-
ing tho manner in which tho Ministerial
resignation was tendered. The oonduct of
the Governor seemed to support tho general
boliof that ho and Sir Patrick Jennings
were simply ondeavouring to cut the Colonial
Secretary out of the Cabinet. Lord Caring-
ton evidently did not regard tho matter as
one of serious importance, for he went off on
a jaunt to Sutton Forest, as though no-
thing particular had oocurred, leaving the
oolony practically without a Government
on the vory eve of the assembling of Parlia-
ment. When Mr. Dibrs telegraphed that
he would resign in order to reliovo his
Excellency of embarrassment, tho Governor
returned what was evidently intended to be
a sarcastic reply. “I thank vou," he said,
“for your genorous offer." AH this went to
•how that some arrangement had been made
whereby Sir Patrick Jbnninos was to be
again entrusted with the seals of offico.
Yet at the eleventh hour Sir Henry Parkk-s
was called in 1 If any understanding did
exist between Lord Oarinoton ana Sir
Patrick Jennings, it was the most extraor-
dinary agreement Co-which a constitutional
Governor ever allowed himself to be made a
party ; and if no understanding existed, why
was the resignation not accepted without a
moment's dolay? Macaulay has affirmed
that the worst Government in the world is
S referable to nono at aIL Perhaps Lord
arinotox was merely experimenting with
the view of disproving this theory.
But he should be informed that
New South Wales does not want
an experimenting Governor added to
her other ills. - Nor does she want a
Governor who seeks advioe from men not re-
sponsible to Parliament. At the time of the
overtly made, and has remained unchallenged,
that the late Chief Justice was called in for
advice by Lord Carinoton ; and now it is
as publicly doclarod that another man has
been performing the role of unconstitutional
and irresponsible adviser to his Excellency,
in connection with the Jbxninga-Dibbs im-
broglio. ‘ We may .rest assured that the
gentleman who was used by Mr. Dibbs to
intoxicate the people with copious draughts
of rhetoric whenever they sought to compre-
hend the financial position of the Govern-
mont would not reoommond the sending for
'6b Henry Parker until the last moment ;
and hence perhaps tho miachiovotu procrasti-
nation that has occurred.
Sir Henry Parker has re-entered office
after a prolonged rustication. Yet he sooms
•to make a fresh start precisely at tho point
where four years ago he left off. He~“ has
learnt nothing and forgotten nothing." It
is difficult to transplant an oak at wo
may be sure the man who has lived so long
as Sir Henry Parkbs in an atmosphere of
Freetrado will find it hard to get on with
strongly with Protection. * The ? present
House and Sir Henry are not in the least
likely to have confidence in each other ; and
we make no doubt tho new Prime Minister
has arranged in advanco foe a dissolution.
But the point is, what does the country
think 1 From every quarter tho news
arrives that Protection is the fast-
coming power, nor is that news mere
ldlo rumour. When the Jbmxikqs Mima,
try, which wont into office ostensibly as
Freetraders, broke up v it wasYotind to con-
sist of five Protectionists and four adherents
to‘ tho fiscal faith which is ruining England.
No less than 66 members of tho present
New South Wales Parliament are ready to
support tho imposition of a tax on agricul-
tural produce, and tho man who will tax
com will tax anything. This state of aflairs
is not likely to be changed by an appeal to
the country, from the loudly-expressed
opinionof tho time-servers and dodgers
of politics—most of whom, ominously enough
for tho failing cause of the “ calico Jimmies"
of East Sydney, now sit in the temple of Pro-
tsetionj—havo taken their cuo: Tho journals
which support Parkbs, and are credited with
being fau mouthpiece, aver that his Ministry
is to bo Freetrade to the baokbone. Such a
Ministry can only exist on sufferanoo

man who gave New South Wales
“ Prosperity ” by selling heriinds, and who
has been tried and found wanting in nume-
rous balances ; and looking to the immediate
future--though hopo with her flattering
tongue tempts us to look farther ahead—we
can only porcoive that the colony has got
out of the frying-pan into the fire.

Drowaineaa and Railway Disasters.
Ik instead of winning the doarly bought favour of
the Sydney morning papers by arranging for^the
one except the proprietors of the morning papers
aforesaid, Mr. Lynk had endeavoured to make
railway travelling safer, he would have done
something to vindicate his administration of an
Important Department. The trouble Is this. As
soon as an o/floor is doomed to be qualified to Uko
charge of a railway station, and a vacancy occurs,
hs U made night-offloor-ln-charge—tliat Is to sa»,
he Is responsible for the conduct of traffic at a
station during the night just sa the station-master
Is during the day. For t leelve hours overy night
In Iho week, oven Sunday night, from 6 p. m. to G
am , the night officer occupies a position where a
moment's carelessness may lead to a colossal
years old, and has not dovoloped that steadiness
whloh comes with maturer age. He has not ac-
quired strength of constitution capable of endur-
ing night-work with Impunity ; and having still
not, la up and about all day, and enters upon his
work at night in a drowsy, rtnpld state. Of
course he ought not to do so, but as long as
youths hold such positions such things wljl be
done. He has been tempted to enjoy himself
during the day, and to that temptation has
yielded at the risk of the lives of those who will
be carried past his station at night. In any coss,
the sleep obtained during the heat of the day is
less restful than night sleep. At nearly all coun-
try stations the traffic at night is heavier than
during the day, and the liability to error and
consequent need of vigilance ten times as groat;
yet the day traffic Is directed by a man In the
higher grade of the service, and the heavier re-
sponsibility of tho night trafflo Is borne by a man
who receives leas pay, has had less experienoe,
and Is less capable of oont lnued vigilance. Think
of thesis things, you night travellers, as comfort-
ably bestowed In your bunki you are borne past
obuntry stations; remember that your lives aro
possibly dependent upon the dear-headodness of a
youth who has not slept einoe the day before yes-
terday, and then reflect whether Mr. Lynx would
not have done better to reform the system which
makes these things passible, instead of wasting
his energiet by dangling an Impracticable scheme
of morning malls before tho covetous eyes of the
proprietors of those Influential journala
“ Mr. Dlbbs—Guilty or Not Guilty?"
In the excitement consequent upon the political
changes In New South Wales it must not be for-
gotten that np to the time of writing Mr, Dions
has omitted to clear himself of the damping
charges made against him by Mr. Thomson.
The main facts of the oorrespondenoe most never
be allowed to pasa out of memory so long as Mr.
Dm ns has a seat In the Assembly or aspires fh a
position there. As far as Mr. ls con-
cerned the matter may be allowed to rest: he
never was charged with having wilfully misled his
Ministerial superiors, and the charge of blunder-
ing In his work, preferred against him, 1* fairly
and fully answered by his official record, and by
aoousation. It is quite possible that Mr. Dibbs
may have a defence as strong and sufficient as that
of Mr. Thomson is generally admitted to be, bat
so far It has not been diaoloeed. Possibly Mr.
Dibbs is armed so strong in honesty that such
charges " pass by him as the Idle wind" : It may
be that pride In his past record prompts him
to suffer In sUenos these accusations which
actually affect his honour as a man, as much
as they do his integrity as a politician.
But this Is a false pride, for he must be aware that
In political, no loss than In legal matters, judg-
ment goes by default If there is no appearance by
defendant. Every hour that those accusations
remain unanswered, Adds to tho task of disprov-
ing them. The vital charge is that Mr. Dibbs,
when Treasurer, " oooked " the Estimates for 188 S
by “docking" the Expenditure, and by adding
various sums on to tho “ Estimated " Revenue, in
order to make the figures foreshadow a surplus
for that year in place of a deficit. The accusa-
tion, if it be false, is so gross and heinous a libel,
that no feeling of friendship, sympathy, or com-
passion that Mr. Dibbs may entertain for his
whilom subordinate should deter him from enter-
ing upon Ida prosecution for criminal libel. For,
true or false, so long os the charge Is ucrefuted,
Mr. Dibbs Is Incapable of serving his country in
Parliament although ho may sit and vote there ;
and any constituency nominating him as their
member would share la the disgrace attaching to
an^ imputation. The vile charge Is a
long as it Is undenlod ; " Disprove this accusation

r otigqance is looming in the air. Tho
British have occupied the Burmese ruby-mines
without resistance—or at least they have been
able to shoot and hang and malm everybody who
tried to them what miserable, cowardly
thieves they were—and a syndicate haa been
formed to take over the claim. Wo have not yet
heard Whether there U to be a local board of
directors, but wo trust there will be. It would be
swoet revenge for a portly yellow chairman to
tavy assessments on British shareholders, and by
the time ho had called up half tho capital of the
-Britwflsles, and tho nation which yelped so loudly
far the annexation of Burmah would wish that a
hundred murdered •• dacolts" bad been tiod round

to Bir ’Knery and his new Government which, we
are told. Is to be of strictly Free-trade composi-
tion. It is said on good authority that the
number of members who have plodged themselves
to vote In favour of a tax on agricultural produce
constitute more than a majority of the total
number of members of the present Assembly.
Unless Sir Henry Is prepared to swallow this dose
of protection he will have to treat an affirmation
of the principle aa a want of confidence in his
Government, whereupon, no doubt, he will advise
and secure a dissolution of Parliament and an
appeal to the eleotors on tho question of Free-
trade ▼. Protection—a consummation dovoutly to
be wished.
