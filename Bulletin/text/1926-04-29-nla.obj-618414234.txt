Our Brother’s Keeper
As Judicial Officer, Acting-Administrator
and Lient.-Governor, Hubert Murray, hoav
K.C.M.G., has dived deep into Papuan lore
since he took up his work in the island in
1904. In Papua of To-day, an Australian
Colony in the Making ,(I J . S. King and
Sous: Angus and Robertson), he tells us of
the things done and the conclusions arrived
at.
Unlike his important predecessors in
Papua, Sir William Maegregor and Sir
George le Hunte, Murray had no training
in colonial or any other administrative work.
A scholar and fine athlete at Oxford, he had
become a Parliamentary draughtsman and a
CroAvn Prosecutor in N. S. Wales, with the
prospect of a seat on the Bench at some
future date. Fortuitous circumstances made
him Judicial Officer and later Lieutenant-
Governor of Papua, Avlien the old Colonial
Office regime had passed and Australia had
taken over the charge of the not-greatly-
desired bantling. Whatever some of his
carly-day critics have said about him, there
is no denying that his policy has been justi-
fied by the years, and that his most persistent
opponents have come to admit it.
In an earlier book (1912) the author gave
a summary of the work done in Papua prior
to 1907, when he became Acting-Administra-
tor. The present volume takes up the story
where the other left off. Yet, while record-
ing" much of the accomplishment of the years
between, the new book is for the most parr,
an exposition of Papua’s place in the scheme
of Australian government to-day. " Its open-
ing section, dealing Avitli Papua’s population,
dwells much upon the widely differing types
AA-bich go to make up the comparatively small
whole. Pygmy-Papuan, Papuan; Papu-Mela-
nesian and their transmutations offer as
many puzzles for the anthropologist as their
many varying languages do for the ethnolo-
gist. Like all primitive pe'oples, the Papuan,
a stone-age dAveller, is fenced in by unbe-
lievably complex conventions and rituals. To
get past these is the white man’s difficulty,
but underneath them there is evidence of
a high standard of intelligence and a ready
adaptability to civilised undertakings. There
aHe many expert enginedrivers among the
natives, and at least one anaesthetist! The
author ranks the Papuan as higher in intelli-
gence than the Malay, and there he is in
accord with Richard Wallace.
The'Papuan is not a great criminal, for,
as the author points out, there are feAv
crimes lie can commit save murder, rape and
robbery, and the first named, at least, is often
a social observance. It may be, however,
that if he knew how he would be as crooked
as many civilised whites. That is a matter
to be Avatched in the future. Fenced off from
intoxicating liquor, the Papuan is a stranger
to one of the curses of primitive peoples
elsewhere; and though he is a gambler in
a small way, the two-up school and the pony
courses are sealed books to him. Labor is
becoming recognised as a disagreeable neces-
sity ; but here again the Administration safe-
guards the native. However much he may
desire it, he is not allowed to work con-
tinuously for more than a certain term. He
must go back to his village and take up again
for a time bis old role of peasant proprietor
lest he become a landless man, with no pro-
vision for his old age.
In his chapters on European settlement in
Papua, the author points more than one
moral for the Australian politician who,
ignorant of the country and its requirements,
lias exercised a blighting influence on its
development. In spite of initial errors and
failures, there seemed an assured future for
plantation produce Avlien the new regime
began. But the Navigation Act and the Aus-
tralian duties on Papuan products struck a
deadly bloAA' at the Possession’s trade. The
war slump in the copra market and the fall
in rubber prices piled woe on Avoe, and ship-
ping strikes Avhich cut Papua off from the
outside Avorld almost completed the promise
of a first-class smash. The author has chvelt
at some length' on these handicaps, for the
suspension of the Navigation Act and the
Papuan Preference Act had not come about
at the time his book went to press. Now
that Papua is free to trade with any port
instead of. Sydney only, and vessels of any
nation, Avith- plain or colored crews, may
call for her produce, there should be a revi-
val of the old hopes; Avhile the lifting of the
Australian Customs duties on products of
Australia’s own tropical back-garden Avill re-
move a galling anomaly. It is the ending
of a bad dream for Papua, and one which,
it is hoped, party politics Avill never revive.
The record of latter-day exploration slioavs
that very little of Papua proper now remains
unvisited. Nothing has helped so much in
this direction as the institution of the Patrol
Officers, which has given the administrative
man a chance to look after the often multi-
tudinous affairs of his district. That the
quality of these officials is Avorthy of Aus-
tralia’s proudest traditions is a point that
the author is never slow to stress.
The chapters on Native Administration
are naturally an interesting section of an
arresting book. They open with the axiom
laid down in Section 22 of the League of
Nations Covenant, that the care and develop-
ment of subject native races must be re-
garded as a sacred trust. This, always the
keynote of Papuan administration, has not
always met with general approval. In the
earlier days of Australian control much
trouble Avas caused by the big companies’
impression thajt, as they paid the piper, they
were entitled to call the tune in respect to
native labor. But Avhile the interests of the
native have come first, the claims of the white
investor and the Government’s duty towards
him have also been recognised, and the
native and his Avhite employer are probably
in better accord in the Papua of to-day than
ever before. Here again the author pays
tribute to the Papuan Anthropological De-
partment under Dr.- Strong. ’ It is to this
much-abused science that he apparently looks
i'or aid in warding off the disintegrating influ-
ences of civilisation from the native; to
this and to the substitution of Christianity
by the missions for the complicated social
and cultural structure in Avhich the Papuan
has housed his soul. In the author’s opinion
the native must have new lamps for the old
to light him in his darkness. Else “he is
like a ship without a rudder, and will run
a great risk of' being wrecked in the sea of
alien civilisation.” As Judge Murray truly
says, the Government cannot undertake the
teaching of iCliristianity. His idea is that
the missions should extend their orbits,
helped, of course, by Government subsidies.
Since the old must go, a substitute Avill have
to be found. The missions deserve, much, if
not all, of the good which lias been said of
them. One could wish, however, that there
Avere not so many differing brands of
Christianity offering to the Papuan.

Why Authors Leave Home
The other day I said farewell to an Aus-
tralian novelist who, like most other Aus-
tralian authors have done or are doing, is
going to London, where he is already well
known, having captured a fair reading public
in England and America, and having had at
least one of his excellent romances trans-
lated into a Continental language. Why do
these authors leave home?
Coincident with my farewelling of this
friend, I read W- It. Fleming’s article (R.P.
l/4/’26) on Australian Literature. Had it
been of the same genus as a recent prize
essay on Australian literature which ignored
most of the men and women who are doing
real Avork in favor of literary skirmishers, t
would not have gone far with it. But as-
it had a bread-and-butter flavor I persisted,
and shall comment on two phases only of
what was really an appeal to the common-
sense patriotism of the Australian reading
public: (1) The formation of an Austra-
lian Authors’ Association ; (2) the need for
some protection (in more ways than one)
against the backwash of cheap Yankee and
British magazines that is choking the Aus-
tralian market, and strangling attempts to
produce magazines locally.
There has been an Authors’ Association in
existence off and on for some years. The
don’t-care attitude of the writers themselves
killed the movement when, first it was begun*
Then, four years ago, a resurrection was
attempted in Melbourne, this time as an off-
shoot of the Australian Journalists’ Associa-
tion. E. M. Webb (E. Mery on) Avas the
driving force, and for a time the movement
prospered. A literary agent was appointed,
and he did such good work that the serial
pages of most of the big Australian dailies
began to look ljko real Australian papers—
they actually published Australian serials
and paid so handsomely for them that writ-
ers changed their custom from the kerbstone
cates to Sargents. Writers, too, began to
get a mortgage on the few locally-produced
periodicals with short stories, and Avere-paid
fairly remunerative rates. The objects of
this A.A.A. were not high-floAvn ; its aims
were purely bread and butter. Briefly, they
Avere to .secure by award or agreement
through the A.J.A. set rates for short stories,
verse and articles ; the syndication of serials
and short stories; payment on acceptance
for manuscript; the amendment of the copy-
right laAv so that copyright may be secured
in Australia by American publications only
Avhen these works are published in Aus-
tralia ; an investigation of the business of
publishing in Australia with a view to
discovering whether Australian publish-
ers were taking undue advantage of
the tariff on paper, ink and other printing
materials, to the detriment of Australian
writers ; and the establishment of an infor-
mation bureau for persons desirous of plac-
ing manuscript. Most writers who joined
the association benefited from it, chiefly be-
cause of its agent, Mr. T. J. Symonds, of
the i\felbouriie Publishing Co. In fact, the
brethren and sistren of the pen promised to
become quite prosperous; and then all of
a sudden the A.A.A. collapsed. Perhaps the
fear of prosperity was too great. I have
been endeavoring ever since to revive what
Avas for a time a healthy baby. But—-well,
the brethren just look up, say “What’s the
use?” and go back cursing to their midnight
oil. That is in Melbourne; in. Sydney the
A.A.A. is still breathing. Mr. Fleming says
on this point : “Not many Australians live
by writing books. A few have tried it, but
they are all starved into submission by a
world that would not feed and clothe them.”
True, and by failing to see the advantages
of organised effort the writers are themselves
a good deal to blame for the neglect The
time is not far distant when they will real-
ise ’ this.
As to protection against the overseas
magazine and cheap syndicated press matter,
in a measure I disagree with Mr. Fleming
Avhen as an M.H.R. he refused to plead for
a duty on “foreign” literature. The tariff
as it stands at present .is all against the
local publisher of books and magazines.
Paper, ink and all printing materials are
subjected to a heavy tariff. The local pub-
lisher has to pay that duty, and at the same
time endeavor to compote'against the Ameri-
can and English magazine which comes into
this country by the shipload free of duty.
Under these unfair conditions it is a prac-
tical impossibility for an Australian pub-
lisher to successfully conduct a fiction maga-
zine. I agree there should be no prohibitive
tariff on books; that is to a certain extent a
tax on knowledge. But there should most-cer-
tainly be a tariff (and a heavy one) on
magazine's, and most of all on the syndicated
serials, articles, short stories, “tonic talks”
and other trash that can be bought by the
mile for a mere song. This is the practical
side. If we give it attention by the organ-
isation of authors, political endeavor, judi-
cious self-advertisement and public propa-
ganda, the literary side will soon obtrude
itself.
I believe the Australian author is pre-
phred to do his share of the Avork, if he is
given promise of reasonable support from
the publisher and the bookseller. If this

Disillusionment
The attitude of pessimistic detachment
with which so many modern thinkers view
the perplexities of the world’s affairs is ex-
plicable chiefly on the grounds of disillusion-
ment. Under the new enlightenment ot
science men have been forced to see things
as they are, and not as they would like to
imagine them to be. Cherished hopes have
therefore been chilled, aspirations rendered
futile. Although pessimism has always been
regarded as a temperamental matter, now-
adays more and more cultured men are
tuning-in with the lyre of Omar the tent-
maker, and repeating the phrases of Kohe-
leth the sceptic. For to see in a much-
vaunted progress merely an increasing
aggrandisement of material wealth, and in
civilisation merely “the multiplying of the
baser forces of humanity as compared with
the higher,” is to fall into line with the
gloomy prognostications of Dean Inge, and
to acknowledge the terrible truth of Arthur
Balfour’s dismal axiom that “man will go
down into the pit, and all his thoughts will
perish.”
Of course the majority do not believe
such doleful prophesyings. Their natural
vanity prevents them from seeing themselves
vanquished. They go through life without
question, content to burn incense to the
business ideal of a large income, to marry
and beget children, to share in what physical
happiness comes their way. They accept
the beliefs of others and harbor the pre-
judices of their neighbors. They bow before
current opinions, however fallacious, and
care not to oppose popular causes. A lazy
acquiescence marks the mental attitude of
the majority. But among the growing class
of thinking men, scientists and artists alike,
there is an ever-widening stream of pessi-
mism discernible.
Science has opened new doors, and is still
opening them. Things undreamed of by, our
ancestors are taken for granted. The forces
of nature have been overcome, the wells of
energy tapped. But with all this new know-
ledge comes disillusionment. Biological
science has put man in proper perspective;
and the allied researches of anthropology
have filled in the unedifying background.
His life has been re-valued and issued in a
new edition, making his insignificance in the
scheme of things more apparent. He is made
aware of the inequalities which exist among
the species. He knows the laws of heredity,
the inborn qualities of greatness and the
seeds of degeneracy which lie hidden in the
embryo. He sees men bent and maimed by
their environment. He sees the dawn-peeps
of glittering possibilities; but he also sees
himself in his awful nakedness and hears the
muffled drums of death beating beneath all
his activities and pleasures.
Progress is a common assumption, spring-
ing from an innate wish for happiness and
the continuation of life after death. It is
the idea that civilisation is continually mov-
ing towards an ethical ideal; but unless that
ideal is defined it is impossible to be certain
of any progress other than that of mere
movement of change. While the goal of
human destiny is hidden, progress . remains
more a supposition or a devout wish than
any tangible reality.
History shows man in the most pitiful
light; doing most unjustifiable things, selling
his birthright, embroiled in useless warfare,
committing crimes, practising fraud _ and
tyranny, a slave to* the meanest necessities.
Its blood-stained pages display an unparalleled
record of rapacity, arson and murder, and
force from unbiased lips the conclusion that
there has been no verv obvious progress to-
wards the Platonic ideal. For progress does
not mean faster elevators, more telephones,
bigger flying machines, more autocratic mono-
polies. Rather is the idea governed by con-
siderations to which so little heed is paid—
of racial hygiene, better and braver children
who can grow up robust and sane, without
the splints of surgery or the correctives of
medicine; children in whose veins flows blood
untainted bv the venom of degeneracy and
disease. Progress is synonymous with the
growth of altruism and the development of
a cleaner intellectual life.
Not to believe in progress is a modern
form of heresy. Yet the thinking man must
often doubt the existence of such a condi-
tion about which after-dinner speakers and
political windbags are so assured. He must
have grave misgivings at times about the
shimmering white outlines of the Promised
Land, and think that they belong merely
to a mirage in the far distance. And who
can blame him for doubting that over such
a remote country the sun shines eternally?
Revelation ceased witli the Jewish disper-
sion. Jehovah has been silent for 2000 years:
the thunders of Sinai no longer echo His
voice. But men will continue to speculate,
whether in shares or on matters of racial
destiny. There will always be prophets. The
Ezekiels of every country will continue to
preach destruction, and the optimists to point
to the sky. There may be a key which will
unlock the future: there may be a plan
which -will solve the mystery of life. But
at present they are hidden; and the attitude
of the thoughtful man is one of unsettled
perplexity. Though the prevailing Church
still nurses its claims to divine enlighten-
ment, belief in personal immortality is
shrinking; faith is fading; scepticism is
growing. Formerly the advanced among
men worshipped reason ; now they are com-
mencing to distrust it. Argument and sup-
position have so often been baffled. The
Jews in their journey through the wilderness
followed a cloud by day and a pillar of fire
by night. Modern man has neither. Blind
guides are continually shouting to him to take
this way and that way; ecclesiastics think
to look beyond the grave; while the impotent
pessimists find vanity in all things. There
is no collective idea which finds universal
acceptance. We have no star to follow.
Millennial aspirations have ceased to in-
terest thinking men; they choose to find
a ' lJ *PPi neBs they can in life, content to
let death, the most perplexing of mysteries,
take care of itself.
Heraclitus long ago emphasised the
the constancy of change. Civilisation is
in a perpetual state of flux, and new
achievements are sure to add variety
to life in the future. New discoveries
will enrich man’s experience. Genius will
flower as of old, adorning the intellectual
life with the gifts of song and the symbols
of beauty. From time to time in the long
hereafter, trfumph w’ill walk with disaster.
A philosophy of life is needed: something
which will give spiritual permanence to the
race which we are so laboriously and blindly
building. No mere pygmy faith or humble
aspiration can satisfy. It must be a philo-
sophy which, springing from the imagination
and the desire for ecstasy, annihilates shame,
vitalises the slumbering senses and links our
little lives with Eternity. But wliat will
ultimately befall “God’s most glorious ani-
mal” one dare not guess. Some think he will
reach heights undreamed of; others that he
will drowse eternally in the miasma of
mediocrity. He began, a conscious _ clot, in
primeval slime: he yet may achieve tho
sovereignty of a superman. But for the pre-
sent the end is as obscure as the beginning.
REG. S. ELLERY.
Shakspeare’s Pound of Flesh
The pair, deep in conversation, would have
let the third man pass with a mere mental
reflection on the effeminate fashion of his
clothes, but he turned suddenly upon them.
“Why, Frankey!” he cried.
Recognition was then mutual. Francis
Drake’s friend, Colville, acted as expounder
of the history of his companions since they
had last met. Sidney had been in Italy on
the Queen’s business. At the cue given by
the reference to his exploits, Francis Drake
commenced to tell how he had singed the
Spaniard’s beard.
“Marry, I heard of it in Rome,” said Sid-
ney, with a laugh. “The news of the exploit
in San Domingo set two worthy citizens
by the ears: a Roman merchant, one
Paul Secchi, and a Jew, Sampson Cone-
da, mark you. Secchi, having rich car-
goes, had, with wisdom, insured them
with the Jew, to whom, well satisfied
that the circumcised infidel should have
to pay, he goes with the news, only
newly arrived. ‘l’ll lay you a pound of my
flesh it is a lie!’ quoth the Jew, eager to arm
his own confidence. Whereupon Secchi
wagers him a thousand of his crowns against
a pound of the Jew’s flesh. When thy suc-
cess was confirmed, Frankey, the wager
comes to the ears of Pope Sextus, who send-
etli for the parties. ‘Contracts,’ quoth he,
‘must be fulfilled. Take a knife, therefore,
Secchi, and cut a pound of flesh from any
part you please of the Jew’s body. We ad-
vise you, however, to be very careful, for if
you cut but a scruple more or less than your
due you shall certainly be hanged; go and
bring hither a knife and a pair of scales, and
let it be done in my presence.’ The Pope,
however, relented his decree immediately;
and what thinkest thou? He sentences both
to death, the Jew for having consented to
suicide, and the Christian for being guilty
of premeditated murder.”
“Marry, that is a story I must tell to one
I know, a man named Shagspere—a clever
rogue when sober, and one skilled in the art
of play-writing,” said Colville. “A rare play
he will make of it, I warrant.”
It was probably that story, broadcasted by
the Elizabethan equivalent of the Sun’s ex-
clusive cable-service a few years before Shaks-
peare produced “The Merchant of Venice,”
that provided the original urge for the writ-
ing of that play. The story is contained in
“The Life of Pope Sextus V.,” written by
Gregorio Leti, who flourished between 1630-
71. The story would certainly resurrect a
number of older stories, some of them dating
back centuries before, and much more on the
lines of Shakspeare’s plot.
“The Reliques of Ancient English Poetry,”
published by Bishop Perry in the later part
of the eighteenth century, contains “Gernutus,
the Jew- of Venice; a new song, showing the
crueltie of Gernutus, a Jew, who. lending to
a merchant an hundred crowns, would have
a pound of his flesh because he could not
pay him at the time appointed.” This nar-
rative verse was popular at about the time
when “The Merchant” was produced, and
whole lines are similar to those in Shaks-
peare’s work. It may have been written
upon the play, an attempt of a rough ballad-
seller to make money out of the fame it had
earned; but the crudities would suggest that
Sliakspeare saw these lines and refined those
he wanted.
Of course the flesh-bond was known in
early Roman days, and stories of adamant
creditors —not in every instance a Jew —seek-
ing the contracted flesh were frequent.
Sliakspeare almost of a certainty must have
become acquainted with the tale contained
in a collection of Italian stories, “II Peco-
rone,” published in 1378. Gianetto, in charge
of a mercantile expedition for his Venetian
friend Anseldo, puts into Belmonte, where
there is a lady of great wealth who is pre-
pared to marry the man who can overpower
her. Gianetto fails in the attempt, as a
result of soporific drinks, and forfeits his
(or rather Anseldo’s) vessel. His friend,
intrigued by the adventure, fits him out for
another venture, upon which he again loses ;
but he wins when Anseldo has fitted him
out a third time on money borrowed from
a Jew upon the flesh-bond. After that (ex-
cepting Jessica’s story) the tale is much the
same as Shakspeare’s, even to Gianetto’s
wife disguising herself as a lawyer. The
story of the ring is included in the narrative,
and its end comes with reunion and explana-
tions at Belmonte.
An Eastern version was contained in “The
Persian Moonshee,” a collection of Persian
stories translated by F. Gladwin and pub-
lished in 1875. In this the plaintiff brings
action against a man who is unwilling to
forfeit the seer of flesh he has lost in a wager.
The Court gives judgment in the plaintiff’s
favor, but threatens suitable punishment if
he takes more or less than the exact amount.
In the “Gesta Romanorum,” a collection of
old monkish tales, the story appears in a
mediaeval setting. A knight who has failed
in two attempts to win the daughter of
Selestinus, the Emperor, each failure costing
him “an hundred marks of florens,” makes
a flesh-bond with a merchant in order to
secure money for a third attempt. This time
he is successful, but forgets to pay up, and
the merchant claims the bond. The Emperor
is forced to give judgment, but the lady fn
the case, entering in the guise of a knight,
puts in the argument “there was no covenant
made for the shedding of blood; if he sheds
any blood with his shaving of the flesh, then
shall the King have good law upon him.”
In the “Cursor Mundi,” a long religious poem
written towards the end of the thirteenth
century, it is a Jew again who lends to a
Christian goldsmith a sum of money, and if
it is not repaid an equal weight of flesh is
forfeit. The Judges give the ruling for the
adamant Jew; “but if he lose a drop of blood
the wrong is on you.” In “The Orator,” a
book of “discourses,” translated from the
French by Anthony Munday about 1596, the
“95th declamation” has the title: “Of a Jew
who would for his debt have a pound of the
flesh of a Christian.” The Judge in this
makes no mention of blood, but decrees that
“if he cut either more or lesse, then his owne
head shall be smitten off.” This is mainly
an argument on rights, in which the Jew
pleads: “I have need of this flesh to cure a
friend of mine of a certain maladie which
otherwise is incureable.”
Several editors have used the known date
of the publication of “The Orator” as a
means for fixing the year of the production
of “The Merchant”; it seems more likely that
Shakspeare was indebted to “II Pecorone.”
Much more probable than that Munday’s
translation preceded the writing of “The Mer-
chant” is it that a cultured patron who had
both foreign books in his library, knowing
the task Shakspeare was undertaking, trans-
lated portions for him, and later, delighted
with his success, prompted Munday, to whom
he may also have been a patron or friend,
to translate into English a book which, be-
sides becoming generally popular, might help
Shakspeare with legal argument in court
scenes introduced into other plays.
Stephen Gosson, in “The School of Abuse,”
published in 1579, denounces the scurrility
of current plays, from all but two of which
he wishes the stage purged, one of the two
being “ ‘The Jew’. .. showne at the Bull.. . .
representing the greediness of worldly chasers
and the bloody minds of usurers.” Obviously
that indicates a previous play (now lost)
very much like the one which introduces
Shylock.
Shakspeare (or whoever was Shakspeare
if he wasn’t himself) had a mass of material
to draw upon in the libraries of patrons (or
in his own), and probably drew upon the
lot. But the popular revival of the old story
following the spread of the yarn in which
Pope Sextus was concerned was without
doubt liis inspiration.
As an alternative, it is quite easy to imagine
a managerial conference in which words such
as these were spoken: “Everybody seems to
have gone crazy on stories about Jews and
the flesh-bond. If we get out something on the
subject we’ll turn ’em away, my boy—turn
’em away! I’ve dug up this play, ‘The Jew,’
and thought of a revival; but you could make
something better of it; and you might throw
in a woman who is the chief genius in the
show—that’ll please the Queen. I got that
in talking over the idea with the Earl of
Oxford; he says he has a book in which a
woman’s wit saves a man from having to
pay the flesh-bond; if you look him up he’ll
be glad to let you have the yarn. Silly rot,
of course, but it does us no harm to please
her Majesty.” That’s the way it might be
done in our time; there is no reason why it
should not have been done in Shakspeare’s.
HAROLD MERCER.
“Centurion”: In his entirely delightful musings
on mortuary literature (R.P. 8/4/’26) Allan W.
Dawes errs in ascribing “Wrap me up with my stock-
whip and blanket” to Banjo Paterson. It was a
popular sOng on the Queensland cattle-stations long
before Banjo saw print, and was adapted from the
old Ihdian Army ballad, “The Gallant Young
Lancer,” while the tune is the “Cavalry Canter”
played by the bands at mounted reviews. Banjo’s
supreme achievement in tombstone verse is in “The
Geebung Polo Club”:—
By the old Campaspe River, where the breezes shake
the grass,
There’s a row of little tombstones which the stock-
men never pass.
This inscription’s on them written, “Stranger, pause
and drop a tear,
For the Sydney polo players and the Geebung boys
lie here.”
“Ah Gee”: It is not often remembered- that Swift’s
Lilliput was placed on the southern coast of Aus-
tralia. Gulliver was wrecked there on November
5, 1699, at the time Dampier was exploring the n.-w.
:oast. The land of the Honvhnhnms was assigned a
place south of Western Australia. But Swift had a
very hazy notion about the size of Australia, for he
made Gulliver traverse all the south coast in a
couple of days in a sailing-boat. Brobdingnag, by
the way, was supposed to be in British Columbia.
“Mako”: Maoriland has produced a very youthful
poetess in Beatiice Holmes, whose “Morning Song”
has been published by the Morton Press in London,
with a preface by an ex-Governor’s wife, the Countess
of Liverpool. All the poems were written before
the author was 16 ; another young M.L. girl, Betty
Rhind, has illustrated the book very cleverly.
“Zanthus”: Three years ago Gregory Mathews
offered his wonderful library, containing 5000 volumes
dealing with ornithology and especially with Aus-
tralian birds, to the Commonwealth for £3OOO.
Since it includes almost all known works on the
birds of Australasia, many of which are out of
print and others are not to be found in any library
in the Commonwealth, 12s. a volume all round seems
exceptionally moderate. Apparently this struck the
owner when his offer was not closed with promptly,
and he raised the price to £5OOO. Offers are
said to have come from U.S.A., so the library is
likely to go there, as John Gould’s material went
to Philadelphia.
“Mat Lowe”: I am sufficiently Australian to depre-
cate the dumping of any cheap or nasty literary
product from abroad to the disadvantage of the
local writer; but why do so many Bulletin contribu-
tors inveigh against the Yank in particular? Cer-
tainly we get a lot of inferior printed matter from
America, but most of it is clean, which is more than
can be said of some of the English importations.
So far I have found few Yankee equivalents for, say,
Arlen, McKenna, Frankau, Willard, Danby, Hull and
the crude and vulgarly funny Travers. The fact
that some of these write well only reveals the pros-
titution of their art when it descends to unnecessarily
dirty detail —or dots. I know of only two Americans,
Fabian and the later Hughes, who compete at all
with the up-to-date English school. It has remained
for “Britishers” to glorify the amours of a stallion,
lament their impotence from the literary housetops,
and drag the lavatory into their works. Why not
bar the lot?

THE NEW EDITION of
“Who’s Who in America”
is the most powerful argument
ever printed in favor of training
for success. It contains the
names of 25,357 Americans who
have climbed to the top in busi-
ness and the professions.
“Who’s Who” is the accepted
criterion of success in our
American life. Consider these
startling facts: —
77 per cent, of the 25,357 people
in the new edition of “Who’s Who”
attended college.
14 per cent, of them had only a
high school training or its equivalent.
Only 9 per cent, had but an elemen-
tary school training.
What does this mean? It
means that if you had only a
preparatory school education the
odds against you are 3 to I as
compared with the chances of a
college man. If your education
stopped with the grammar
school, the odds against you are
9 to 1.
The time has passed, in other
words, when a man can merely
“start at the bottom” and, with-
out training, get to the top. The
high places demand training, ana
business moves too swiftly for
the man who does not have it or
will not take the trouble to get
it for himself.
Dean Joseph French Johnson,
of New York University, recog-
nised this fundamental truth
vividly when he and his associ-
ates established the Alexander
Hamilton Institute sixteen years
ago. The soundness of their
vision has been proved by the
more than 250,000 men who
have shortened their paths to
success through this sound, prac-
tical form of university training
for business.
An advertisement such as this
can give no adequate conception
of the character of the Institute s
training or the unique methods
which make it so definitely
capable of immediate results.
The whole story is told in a book
entitled “Forging Ahead in
Business.” You are invited now
to send for a free copy of that
book.
What guarantee do you have
that it is worth your while to
send for it?
1. First of all, the men behind

ANNOUNCEMENT
HE increase of popularity and the consequent expansion of busi-
ness is the finest gauge of the quality of a product. Packard cars
are acknowledged a quality product, and means to cope with
the greatly increased volume of business and to provide a thor-
oughly efficient service to Packard owners have become an urgent necessity.
Realising this, Packard has built for itself a new home Berk House
conveniently situated in one of the main thoroughfares of the city—William
Street. We have pleasure in announcing that these premises are now open
for business and a cordial invitation is extended to interested motorists to
inspect these showrooms.
Berk House is one of the most up-to-date motor showrooms in Sydney. It
has four floors in all, of which the basement and ground floor will be occupied
by Packard as showrooms, stores, service station, and offices. Fitted with
every modern appointment that efficiency and convenience can suggest, these
new showrooms will be a fitting background for a car of the Packard class.
To sense the mastery of the power embodied in a car is one of the keenest
delights of motoring. Packard has always appreciated this phase and recent
improvements in the Packard engine have greatly increased the power of
both the Packard Single-Six and the Straight-Eight; and, as ever, the
Packard remains supreme.

Horse and Boy.
When I rode, a happy boy,
All alone ’neath gum-trees tall,
Overfull with health and joy,
Lord, how wonderful was all!
Horse and I —on ways apart,
Ways aloof from worry—went,
Beat of hoof and beat of heart
Keeping time in merriment.
Fresh about us sui'gcd the breeze,
Tossing leafage, high and low;
Pleased were all the nodding trees
To behold us, mated so.
Matched in spirit gay were we,
Glad of earth and air and sky;
Willing as the wind was he,
Woeless as the wind was I.
Careless all what might betide,
On we sped ’neath Heaven’s blue;
Neither whip nor spur I plied,
Neither spur nor whip he knew.
Sometimes sang a happy bird
As we galloped green leagues o’er;
Sometimes for a friendly word
Halted we at gate or door.
Halting thus at door or gate—
Greeted, cheered by neighbors glad—-
Bread of kindness oft we ate,
Draughts of kindness oft we had.
Thus it was in days of yore,
Days of youth that golden glowed.
Docs the open heart and door
Still exist by track and road?
This I wonder, musing much,
Thralled and charmed by memory.
Are the brown bush-dwellers such
As their fore-folk used to be?
Lord of everything is change.
Sun and season, star and sea;
Old familiar things gi’ow strange,
All the world is new to me.
Yet ’twere joy again to ride
As I rode ’neath Heaven’s blue,
When nor whip nor spur I plied,
And nor spur nor whip he kxxew.

In Those Days.
The world was a wide and lonely place
In olden times, my dear;
All sox-ts of wonders came to pass
And nobody was near!
A wing-helmed shouting viking
Strode up the pebbled shore
Where never the voice of an out-world man
Had stirred the deeps before.
A tongueless dwarf moaned in the wood;
His little wife, too, was dumb;
Nor even the priests of the mountain folk
Could tell whence they had come.
Though sagas and strange legendry
Are piled at the heart of man,
The world was wonderfuller yet
Before the songs began!
Witches and knights and whimsical folk
Peopling the stellary gales
Alighted gently, one by one,
And filled the world with tales.

Say, love, shall we hasten
Or, love, shall we stay,
Or, love, shall we loiter along the highway?
Shall we clasp in the shadowy pools of the

Or weep, love, that autumn
Goes over so soon?
The light wind has shaken
A leaf on your hair;
The sad trees are sighing “Beware, oh,

Bitter winter wall come with the wane of

And youth is a season
Goes over so soon.”

Gifts from the treasure of land and sea;
Color and song from the shining shore,
Blue and gold from the ocean store ;
Jewels agleam where the breakers curl,
Sapphire, emerald, opal, pearl;
Tangle of tea-tree and bracken fern,
Sun-dappled shadow at every turn ;
Soft, white bottle-brush blooming sweet,
Misty paths for my straying feet,
Beckoning, promising joys unseen
Through leafy trees and a dcptli of green;
Drooping boughs and a breeze that sings,
Twitter of birds and a flash of wings;
And, over the cliffs the tea-tree through,
A gleam of white and a glint of blue;
Peace and beauty and witchery,
The ceaseless song of the surging sea;
Color and sound from the shining shore,
Gold and blue from the ocean store;
Jewels agleam where the breakers curl,
Sapphire, emerald, opal, pearl.
Joy, oh joy, for my heart is light
For the loveliness and the cloudless height,
For the blue that lies to the world’s far rim,
For the cup of life with the sparkling brim !
The sun is kissing my outstretched hands.
From over the sea and the smooth, bright
sands
A murmurous music fills my ears.
I hear the songs of the coming years,
And its burden is sweet, is sweet to me,
For the song is of joy in the yegrs to be.

MEDICAL REPORT ON SMALL
SISTER.
The official announcement has been made
that a State of the Commonwealth may be
compelled to declare itself at least partially
bankrupt, thereby breaking the ice, or paving
the way, or setting up a precedent, unless
substantial and possibly permanent assist-
ance is forthcoming. It is certainly the
smallest State, but a small precedent, like
a small baby, may grow. The matter has
been taken by the general public, the press
and the mass of politicians with a torpid
calm which might almost suggest that the
event was accepted as the beginning of the
inevitable. When a British Cabinet Min-
ister begins to talk of the possibility of civil
war there may be a feeling that the old
order is changing, and if it decides to change
that is its own affair. Still, the Federal Gov-
ernment sent over to Tasmania as a Com-
mission of Inquiry an elderly and dignified
ex-public servant best known as a Chief Col-
lector of Customs and Excise, and his sug-
gestions for meeting the crisis are regarded
as scrappy, insufficient and unsatisfactory.
They include:—
An instalment loan of £1,000,000 without in-
terest (as if existing loans aren’t numerous enough),
to be spent under Commonwealth supervision (this
can be seen at work any day all over the Northern
Territory) in improving agriculture and horticulture.
(Tasmania remarks here that imported hops and
imported oats are able to beat it. in the mainland
ports because they come by cheap-labor oversea
ships, while it has to trade, under the Navigation
Act, by erratic coastal ships—the most expensive
ships going. Small Sister says that all this makes
her a trifle tired of agriculture.)
A temporary grant of £50,000 per annum, to be
spent on afforestation under Federal control —speci-
mens on view daily in the N. Territory. (Tasmania
recalls at this point that it is already about seven
times more afforested than the Commonwealth aver-
age. Still, more forests would be beneficial if the
law' was more helpful of the export business. Re-
cently it was found that the only way to get a
cargo of big hardwood timber to Melbourne was by
scow. That unmanageable type of vessel accumulated
costs for weeks or months on the high seas, and then
drifted miserably into Sydney. But for the guiding
hand of Providence it might have drifted into
Switzerland.)
An annual grant for 10 years to be used under
Federal instructions (the N.T. is full of them)
in reduction of the ruinous and well-nigh impos-
sible tax burden.
Also a grant of £lO,OOO a year for 10 years to
open up the West Coast, and one of £500,000 to-
wards the great hydro-electric scheme, in considera-
tion of the heavy burden which the little State
assumed, at Federal instigation, for the establish-
ment of the electrolytic-zinc industry in Australia.
Further, in consideration of the fact that “Tas-
mania is the only State which has not received in-
direct benefits by Commonwealth expenditure with-
in its borders for the purpose of purely national
policy.” The Commissioner cited the Federal rail-
ways, the sugar bounty, shipbuilding, the Murray
Waters scheme and defence factories, to all of which
Small Sister had to contribute.
* * # #
The Commissioner then proceeded to take a
pessimistic glance at the Tas. railway sys-
tem. To condense his story; “Lines have
been built without the least justification.
Several of these not only fail to pay interest
but are unable even to meet working ex-
penses. It is imperative in the interest of
the State that these lines should be closed.
Further, in no circumstances should con-
tracts be entered into for the carriage of
goods at less than cost of haulage.” These
may be words of wisdom, but Tasmania has
a right to reply that the Federal Govern-
ment has a whole railway system (1733
miles) which fails to pay interest, and is
“unable even to meet working expenses,”
and though this is all on the mainland the
island State pays its share. Then Commis-
sioner Lockyer’s own State had, by last
returns, 30 railways, three of them over 100
miles long, which pay neither interest nor
working expenses. No one suggests closing
the bankrupt Federal or N. S. Wales lines,
nor did anyone tell Westralia to close its
non-paying railways when it asked for aid
at the general charge. In addition, N. S.,
Wales’s Railway Commissioners carry one-
fourth of their freight at about half or less
than half the cost of haulage. As experts,
they seem to suffer from the idea that the
practice pays indirectly or somehow. An-
other point is that when Tasmania built the
great bulk of its railways there was no idea
that the Navigation Act was going to strike
the place, and though the system was never
any great shakes of a profit-earner, it was
showing itself just before the shock better
able to earn its living than those of Queens-
land, Westralia or S. Australia, to say no-
thing of the Federal calamity. In 1920-21
the Tasmanian system earned £2 6s. per
cent, towards interest on cost, Westralia £1
12s. 10d., S. Australia £1 9s. 7d. and Queens-
land 11s. 2d., while the Federal show
produced much less than nothing. It was
only after the new marine law struck the
island that it learned how unpayable a dud
its system was. A drop of net takings to
less than one-tenth the old figure was con-
vincing. Mainland Labor politicians de-
clare passionately that the spell of prosperity
would have died as completely without the
Act, but they don’t say w r hat it would have
died of. The Commissioner who sat on
Small Sister regarded the heavy expenditure
on roads as another evidence of bad house-
keeping, in view of the fact that the convicts
left 200 miles of good highway behind them.
To w r hich a natural answer is that the State
has to maintain many hundreds of miles
which the convicts didn’t leave behind them,
and that, anyhow, the convicts, like the
Romans, passed out a long time ago.
* * * *
To sum up the case, the aids which the
critical gentleman proposed are temporary,
and quite insufficient to meet a situation
which appears to be permanent. They are
a weird mixture of annuities terminable at
fluctuating dates and gifts subject to compli-
cated conditions. There is rather much
Federal supervision about them, and in super-
vising neither its railways nor its mercantile
fleet, its Northern Territory nor its huge
London establishment, has Federal super-
vision paid much of a dividend. It would be
better and more definite to cut down the alms
to one item, and give permanent assistance
by taking over Tasmania’s outside debt, and
to cut down the supervision to one item
likewise—the insertion of a clause in the
local Constitution that outside borrowings
are for ever prohibited. A side-issue in this
partial filing of Australia’s first public
schedule has received 1 little, if any, attention.
The troubles of the Government at Hobart
began with the coming of the Federal tariff,
for it lost a larger proportion of its revenue
than any other State. (In fact, four of them
lost nothing, and N.'S.W. gained enormously.)
It lost something more under the uniform
subsidy. The Navigation Act and the marine
strikes heaped disaster on it. Then it
hastened the inevitable crisis in this way:—•
State Roan Expenditures per Head, 1924-25.
Westralia .. .. .. .. £ll 5 2
S. Australia .. .. • • 6 10 9
Queensland .. .. .. .. 6 0 1
Victoria .. .. .. .. 5 6 2
N. S. Wales 4 15
Tasmania .. ..... ... 123
Doubtless the Hobart Ministry felt that to
attempt 1.0 an.-mongering on the usual scale
and simultaneously to announce that the
State might cease to be a solvent debtor
would be not quite gentlemanly. It didn t
even borrow enough in London_ to pay the
London interest bill. The possibility remains
that, if Tasmania hadn’t cut down its wild-
catism as it did, its crisis might have been
postponed for a good while, and that if some
of its neighbors had similarly put in the
plug their crises might have arrived instead,
and they might be sitting in a row outside
the Federal Treasurer’s door. But for the
fact that he helped his Federal finances with
£7,317,370 of loan money (say, £1 ss. per
inhabitant) Earle Page might have had a
sort of crisis himself, and be sitting outside
his own door.
LANG’S FORTY-FOUR HOUR WEEK
FIASCO.
Pursuant to its policy of being excessively
liberal at other people’s expense, the N. S.
Wales Labor party, in bidding for votes at
the last election, undertook to reduce the
general working week from 48 hours to 44
without any loss of wages to those whose
votes were sought. It did not suggest that
there might be difficulties in the way ; when
Labor politicians go after votes difficulties
are never mentioned. But before the Lang
Government had been three months in office
the proposed beneficiaries learned, some oi
them with chagrin, that it was one thing to
promise the 44-hour week and another to
deliver the goods. In the first place, the
Federal election was coming on, and the
necessities of Charlton’s party had to be
considered. Without eight or nine N. S. Wales
country seats, Charlton’s party would have
to remain in Opposition, and its miserable
showing on the transport-strike question had
made the cockies uncordial, to say the least.
They were certainly in no mood to be told
that they would have to give their employees
the 44-hour week. So rural workers were
excluded from the measure then being
knocked into shape by the bright young legal
minds of the Labor Caucus and from the
accompanying Arbitration Bill as well. The
next trouble was that many thousands of
the electors who had been promised the same
wages for 84 per cent, less toil were work-
ing under awards of the Federal Arbitration
Court. An. Act of the N. S. Wales Parlia-
ment could override State awards, morality
being left out of the argument, but could it
override Commonwealth awards? The High
Court had once laid it down that a Common-
wealth award was not a Commonwealth law
within the meaning of that provision of the
Constitution which says that, where there
is a conflict between the law of a State and
the law of the Commonwealth, the law of
the State is invalid to the extent of the
inconsistency; but subsequent judgments
were to a very different effect. In the case
of the engineers the High Court affirmed that
“the moment State legislation encounters re-
pugnant Commonwealth legislation operating
in the same field the State legislation must
give way.” And Starke, J., quoting these
words in the Waterside Workers’ Federation
v. Gilchrist, Watt and Sanderson, said:
“An award made under the authority of
Commonwealth legislation takes its sanction
and its force from such legislation, and has
therefore supremacy over the State law.”
* * * *
In this predicament a brilliant idea
occurred to a member of the Government —
Willis, it would seem. That exuberant
gentleman, recommending the Forty-four
Hour Week Bill to the Leg. Council, held
forth in this ingenuous strain: —
Most of the Federal awards say “the hours of labor
shall not exceed 48.” If we introduced a bill
saying “the hours of labor shall be 49.” then we
would be challenging the Federal law, because we
would be attempting to override it by increasing
the hours beyond the point fixed by the Federal
law. On the other hand, if there is an award
which says that the hours of labor shall not be less
than 48 we are challenging it, but I do not know of
any such award. If such an award does exist, I
assume the courts would decide that we are exceed-
ing our powers by including this provision in this
bill. But so far as I am able to learn, none of the
Federal awards) states that men must work 48 hours,
and when we choose to make the hours of labor less
than 48, I submit we are not exceeding our juris-
diction, and that we have a right to do it.
Professor Peden, the Council’s eminent
legal authority, suggested in his polite way
that the plan was preposterous, but the Gov-
ernment scorns criticism, however friendly
and well-informed. It pinned its faith to
the subjoined clause :
Where in any award or order made under any Act
of the Commonwealth of Australia provision is made
that the standard or ordinary weekly hours of work
or duty of an employee shall not exceed a number
stated as greater than 44, or where expressions of
a like significance occur, then in such a case the
standard or ordinary hours of work or duty of such
employee shall not exceed those prescribed by or
under section five of this Act — i.e., 44.
Another section permitted the employers
concerned to work their men the full 48
hours, but ordered them, in such cases, to
pay overtime rates for four hours, the 48-
liour wage fixed by the Federal Court to be
forthcoming in every instance for 44 hours'
exertion. Thus armed, members of federated
unions brought test cases against employers
who refused to waive their rights. Verdicts
having been given for the plaintiffs by magis-
trates who did not go into the constitutional
position, the defendants appealed to the High
Court, the Government becoming a party to
the proceedings. The High Court judgment
shattered the childish contentions of the
Lang crowd. In allowing the appeals—there
were three —Knox, C.J., ruled that the
Commonwealth Parliament had exercised all
the powers necessary for the making of a
valid and permanent award and that sec-
tions 12 and 13 of the Forty-four Hour
Week Bill were inconsistent with Common-
wealth law and to the extent of that incon-
sistency invalid. Isaacs, J., laid it down
that the settlement of an industrial dispute
on such terms as the Federal Arbitration
Court thinks just cannot be prevented or
impeded by any State law.^
The position now is that the 44-hour week,
which was promised to all 48-hour week
workers without exception or qualification,
is operating only among a section. It is
certainly a numerous section, and another
half a million p.a. or more will have to be
extracted from the taxpayer to meet the addi-
tional expense of running the Government
railways and tramways, the police, fire-
brigade, Water-supply, irrigation, sewerage
and municipal services and the like. Never-
theless, there are no signs of rejoicing among
the recipients of the boon, for the reduction
of hours was followed immediately by a rise
in the cost of living. There has also been a
considerable exodus of employees from small
concerns which could not or would not carry
the new burden, but this effect has been con-
cealed for the time being by terrific loan
expenditure on “reproductive” works of the
sand-shifting order. While Lang and co.
were waiting for the High Court judgment,
Baddeley, the Minister for Labor and In-
dustry, was sent on a mission to other State
Governments to suggest the general intro-
duction of 44-hour week legislation. There
is no likelihood of such legislation being
passed, nor could two or more States upset
Federal awards any more than one State
can. The Victorian Government is hostile to
the 44-liour week. The Tas. Government may
be sympathetic, but can’t afford it. Westra-
lian Labor has conceded the shorter week to
its Government employees, but it is too
scared to impose it on private employers. As
for S. Aus. Labor, the Government entered
into a 48-hour week agreement with the
railway construction workers even while
Baddeley was on his way to Adelaide. In
the end the Lang crowd will probably put
its pride in its pocket and ask Bruce to
move in the direction of securing a uniform
working week, although what Bruce can
do, apart from appointing the usual Royal
Commission, is not clear. Meanwhile N. S.
Wales, besides losing various factories and
jobs—naturally the 48-hour-week States can
do them cheaper—is likely to have strikes
and other unpleasantnesses as consequences
of the Labor party’s reckless election promises
and of its efforts to treat lawful agreements
impartially arrived at as scraps of paper.
IS THE TIN HOUSE UNHEALTHY?
There is no doubt whatever about its dis-
comfort and unsuitability and general objec-
tionableness, but, whilst keeping one eye
firmly on its heat-shimmering contour, it is
well to let the other rove round for some
evidence as to whether the tin house has
done, or is likely to do, any real harm to
the quarter of a million Australians who
live in the tropics. That unbiased person.
Wickens, the Commonwealth Statistician,
has a good deal to say on the subject in a
quiet way. For example, in his census re-
ports for 1911 and 1921 he shows that in the
three principal registration districts in Tro-
pical Queensland, the population grew dur-
ing those 10 years from 130,412 to 179,801;
that is to say, by nearly 38 per cent. Dur-
ing the same 10 years the increase for all
Australia was 22 per cent. The Statistician
also alleges that the natural increase (births
over deaths) for Queensland, 1920 to 1924,
amounting to 16.03 per 1000, was higher
than that of any other State except Tas-
mania, higher also than that of any Euro-
pean country except Russia, higher too than
that of Japan. Ninety per cent, of all Tro-
pical Australians live in Tropical Queens-
land, and form about a third of Queens-
land’s total population. Any shortcomings
in their natural increase would obviously be
reflected in the total rate for the State.
It is also obvious that the first and worst
effect of the tin house must fall on young
infants. Infantile mortality is the most
delicate of all tests of the suitability of any
country for permanent settlement. The meti-
culous Wickens records that from 1920 to
1924 there were 26,175 babies born in Tropi-
cal Australia, and that of every 1000 of them
59 died before reaching one year of age. In
the two most typical and tinny areas, Towns-
ville and Cairns, 15,562 of them were born.
Of these only 50 per 1000 died. The north-
western district of Westralia, the very hot-
test and very tinniest part of our tropics,
lost in the same four years eight out of the
200 infants born there. This works out at
40 per 1000, or the same as Maoriland’s
latest and best with Truby King’s help. For
all Australia, including the tropics, during the
same four years, 57 infants died of each 1000
born, the fourth-lowest infant mortality-rate
in the world. London loses, on recent aver-
ages, 69 per 1000 born, England and Wales
75, Canada 79 and Scotland 98. Nobody
ever accuses these respectable places of hay-
ing tin houses about them. The metallic
abode does not seem to damage the mothers to
any extent either. The inconvenient Wickens
alleges that the death-rate in child-birth in
Queensland is consistently lower than that
for N. S. Wales, Victoria or South Australia.
Nearly a third of Queensland’s total births
occur in the tin-house tropics, and if the
mineralised humpies were liable to kill the
mothers, the results would show Queensland
as worse, instead of better, than the pre-
sumably well-housed States, in respect of
child-bed death-rates. Fertility does not seem
to be affected, either, as the recent Cilento-
Gorman investigation showed that the aver-
age number of children born in 740 house-
holds was well abreast of the Australian
average.
Maybe the tin house gets them later? Tro-
pical Australian children —and children of
white parents born in other tropics—are
often accused of being paler than the non-
tropic born, and therefore possessed. of
“thinner blood.” Breinl and other scien-
tific workers at the Australian Institute of
Tropical Medicine at Townsville showed
years ago that the blood content was the
same as for children elsewhere. The pallor
was due to a surface condition of the skin
only, and had nothing to do with health.
School medical-officers examined thousands
of tropical school-children in many parts of
Australia, and found that they were de-
cidedly taller, somewhat, heavier and
freer from disease and physical defects than
were children in the Southern States. Men-
tally they are at least equal to the southern-
born. Of 44 students at Cairns in 1924 who
had qualified by examination for high-school
education, 39 were tropic-born, and of these
23 were of the second tropic generation on
one side or both. The tin house does not
therefore seem to damage children at school
ages; and Breinl, Young, Cilento, Sunb-
stroem and others have published much evi-
dence, based on exhaustive physiological re-
search, to show that they do not suffer from
any apparent bad effects in later life. The
actuary of the A.M.P. Society made a special
examination of 5000 policies issued to resi-
dents of the Cairns and Townsville areas,
and went on record with the statement that
the rates of mortality were “surprisingly
low” —much below the Australian A.M.P.
figures going back to 1849. Successful life-
assurance concerns are caution personified in
all matters relating to local health risks,
and it is quite clear from this that Aus*


trnlia’s largest office lias no qualms concern-
ing the corrugated shack of the hardy North-
<rTVoiie of this affords, or is intended to
afford the least justification or defence of
the tin house, any more than it justifies the
miles of utterly insanitary London-style ter-
races which disfigure Sydney or Melbourne.
1 do not own a single tin house, and would
Jike to see the infernal things, m which I
have spent many a torrid hour, wiped ott the
face of Australia. They are a blot, though
a removable blot, and a blot which is being
removed as the Northern surplus of mascu-
line population becomes lower—it fell from
17 to 12 between the last two census takings.
But the tin house is not a danger to health.
The warmest advocates of a good cause are
apt to forget that injudicious insistence on
minor detail is liable to distort the public
view of the situation which they are striv-
ing earnestly to better. No country in the
world to-day needs or deserves population
more than does Tropical Australia. Our very
national existence may turn on the extent to
which it becomes populated within the com-
ing generation. Would it not be better to
regard some of the other aspects quoted above
from irrefutable sources, and to depict it in
its true colors as a remarkablv healthy land,
a beautiful land, a fertile land, a land essen-
tially suitable for habitation by white men
and women and their children to many gen-
erations, a land in which a still large but
rapidly decreasing area is still passing
through those early stages of discomfort and
poor housing which prevailed only a couple
of generations ago in New South Wales and
Victoria?

PLAIN ENGLISH.
High Court v. Privy Council.
When the High Court of Australia decided
by a majority, in the recent case of Pirrie v.
McFarlane, that the Victorian Motor-car
Act, in the absence of specific Common-
wealth legislation to the contrary, is bind-
ing on servants of the Commonwealth, it
merely postponed the collision that must,
come sooner or later between the High Court
and the Privy Council on the subject of the
High Court’s exclusive and final jurisdiction
in constitutional questions of purely Austra-
lian import. Motoring along St. Kibla-road,
McFarlane, of the Royal Australian Air
Force, was asked by Pirrie, a Victorian
police officer, to produce his license. He
hadn’t one, his excuse being that he was
driving an Air Force car on Commonwealth
business. When he was prosecuted, the
P.M. dismissed the case, holding that the
State Act did not apply to the Common-
wealth or its servants. The State appealed
from such dismissal to the Full Court of
Victoria. The Full Court warily eyed the
section of the Commonwealth Judiciary Act
which reserves exclusively and finally to the
High Court of Australia the jurisdiction to
determine all questions, however arising, as
to the limits inter se of the constitutional
powers of Commonwealth and State, and
automatically transfers from any Court to
the High Court any proceedings in which
such questions arise. After which it passed
the pigeon on to the High Court, and the
Victorian Government’s appeal was accord-
ingly listed for hearing there in due course.
This did not suit the State. Mindful of a
High Court decision, on which the police
magistrate had based liis opinion, that the
State Act did not apply to the Common-
wealth or its servants, Victoria sought to
side-track the High Court by making appli-
cation to the Privy Council for special leave
to appeal directly to that tribunal in London
from the decision of the police magistrate in
Melbourne —and from the action of the Full
Court of Victoria in trying to pass the matter
on to the High Court instead of itself deal-
ing with it. The Privy Council granted the
special leave to appeal. A cable to that
effect from the Registrar of the Privy Coun-
cil to the Principal Registrar of the High
Court startled the Bench then sitting in Mel-
bourne and almost on the eve of hearing
the appeal. The unexpected development
was announced from the Bench in open court,
and the parties were invited to attend the
following day and explain. Counsel for the
Commonwealth attended, but could not explain
anything; all he could do was to express his
own and his client’s surprise. Counsel for
the Victorian Government respectfully sug-
gested there was nothing to explain. The
High Court then announced that it would
hear the appeal in its proper turn in the
list, despite the special leave granted by the
Privy Council. When, a few days later, the
appeal came on for hearinsr. the State Gov-
ernment was not represented. But counsel
for the Commonwealth Government, never-
theless, was called upon by the Court to jus-
tify the finding of the police magistrate
against which Victoi'ia had appealed. He
offered no argument. Absence and silence,
however, did not prejudice Victoria’s case.
A majority of the Court (Knox, C.J.,
Higgins, J., and Starke, ,T.) upheld Vic-
toria’s contention, allowed the appeal, re-
versed the police magistrate's decision and
fined McFarlane one shilling. The minority
(Isaacs, J., and Rich, J.) upheld the police
magistrate’s decision. Victoria, having thus
succeeded, has no need to proceed further
with the appeal to the Privy Council, and
the Commonwealth will not appeal from the
High Court. Had the actual appeal come on
before the Privy Council Victoria would have
contested the validity of those provisions of
the Commonwealth Judiciary Act confer-
ring exclusive and final jurisdiction on the
High Court in the matters mentioned above.
It would have questioned the power of the
Commonwealth Parliament to oust the appel-
late jurisdiction, in such matters, of either
the Full Court of a State or tin; Privy
Council. That battle has yet to be fought.

Home Ownership for the Poor.
The mildly humanitarian programme of the
Bkuce-Pages, even where it plagiarises
Labor proposals, is deeply distrusted by
almost all class-conscious Laborites on the
ground that the intention is to stave off a
social revolution. The fears are not ill-
founded. A particularly dangerous proposal,
from the point of view of the gentleman who
yearns for a Soviet, with himself as a Com-
missary, is the project for selling poor people
homes on the instalment plan. It isn t: a
new one, of course. Private Enterprise
thought of it years ago, and practises it very
lucratively to this day. Australia has had
a taste of the State administration of such
schemes in the operations of the W ar Ser-
vice Homes Commission. In that case the
main principle involved has been rather
obscured by sentimental and political con-
siderations, but a very clear view of what
happens if such schemes are made a perma-
nent part of State activity can be had across
the Tasman. Maoriland started selling
homes to “workers” —which originally meant
folk whose wages were less than £4 a week
—2O years ago. Usually the worker first
bought the little section of land out of
his own resources. Then the State, came
along, built a house on the land for him and
allowed him to pay for it in equal weekly
instalments, covering principal and a low
rate of interest, spread over 33 years. It
meant a weekly payment of rather less —m
some cases considerably less —than the
worker would have paid in rent, with the
benefit of an assured tenure and a prospect
of living rent free later on. As a business
proposition, looked at from the side of either
the worker or the State, it was open to
certain criticisms, but as a means of secur-
ing social stability it has proved remarkably
efficacious. In the course of years the prin-
ciple has been expanded and extended —there
was a big impetus given just after the war,
when a marked housing shortage was experi-
enced —and for many years the householder
of the Dominion, whether on the basic wage
or enjoying 10 times that stipend, has found
it hard to rent and easy to buy a home. The
State has not done it all, but it has set the
main in the matter of cheap money for home-
purchases, and other agencies—building
societies, insurance companies and other in-
vestors—have followed suit. The result _ is
shown in the last census (1921), statistics
compiled from which are still coming to
hand. According to the census less than
two-fifths of the householders of the
Dominion now are rent-payers. The other
three-fifths have all some sort of equity in the
home they live in, and nearly 13 per cent, of
them enjoy unencumbered freehold. The fact
has an. undoubted bearing upon the relatively
small political support given in Maoriland
to Labor —12 seats out of 80 was the Labor
share at last election. More than 80 per
cent, of the people of Maoriland belong to
the wage-earning classes, and on a clear-cut
class division Labor's share of seats would
be 64. It is not putting it too highly to say
that the main reason why the socialists don't
get the votes of the wage-earners is that so
many of the alleged Seven Devils of social-
ism let loose by Dick Seddon a generation
ago devoted their deviltry to giving the
worker a stake in the country.
♦
Australia’s Cheap Parliaments.
Something would have been lacking if
“great dailies” hadn’t rushed to blame the
cost of Parliamentary government for Tas-
mania’s money troubles. As a sample:—
Tasmania, with all its grievances, manages to
maintain an extensive method of government with
the formalities necessary for a principality of a
million people, rather than for a State which has
been relieved of its external and some of its internal
functions.
Tasmania, by latest figures, ran its govern-
ment machine for £35,629 per annum Gov-
ernor. Government House, two Houses of
Parliament (including estimated value ot
railway passes), Cabinet, Hansard, Royal
Commissions, Select Committees, electoral
office, electoral rolls, etc. It couldn’t be done
for much less even by abolishing the Parlia-
mentary system and letting any casual
Thomas or Jacob take charge. He might
easily cost £1,000,600 instead of £35,629.
The seven Parliamentary machines of the
Commonwealth ran up a bill, in the same
year (1923-24), for £973,140, including all
the above items and three general elections
(Victoria, S.A., and Westralia). That was
less than Sydney City Council expects to
spend, in its haphazard, secretive way, on
the widening of Park-street. Two States,
Westralia and Tasmania, run their two Par-
liamentary shows for a whole year for about
the amount which the same Sydney Council
has added to the cost of its new power-house
at Botany by employing only city workers
known to the aldermen in office instead of
men on the spot. Australia has certainly
no ideal collection of Legislatures, and few
countries have—perhaps none. But the
whole seven, including viceroys and general
elections, cost only 3s. sd. per inhabitant
per year, or about half a drink per month,
and 'the money, unlike that laid out on the
purchase of imported fluff, remains here. A
vastly greater outlay would be worth while,
if it was necessary, for the sake of the pub-
licity which the Parliamentary system gives
to matters which a great many people would
prefer to keep murky. Because publicity
prevents many jobs (though it doesn’t pre-
vent enough jobs), all the worst characters
advocate plain unification, and a multitude
of foolish characters go with them because
they know no better. The ideal of the worst
characters is a single Parliament of a single
House at Canberra, and beneath it a jungle
of little municipal bodies or county councils,
with a tendency to the Sydney municipal
pattern. They would have no powers which
couldn’t be suspended or abolished at short
notice. Also they would print no Han-
sards. The publicity of the local paper in
country districts would amount to very little,
even if any hostile local organ wasn’t shut
out or squared with a printing contract, and
the quiet little elections should be easily
manipulated. Witli the one-House Parlia-
ment shunning publicity at Canberra, and no
other legislative mechanism save these abso-
lutely subordinate and dependent little
shows, the position should favor boodling on
a great scale.

The Opposition’s Task in Queensland.
The Queensland Labor Misgovernment held
43 out of 72 seats in the last Parliament,
and it is sure of five in the next, F. W.
Bulcock (Barcoo), Dave Riordan (Burke),
George Pollock (Gregory), Jack' Payne
(Mitchell) and Randolph Bedford (War
rego) having been returned unopposed. A
Country-Nationalist in 11. F. Walker (Coo-
roora) has also had a walk-over; there was
no contest in his rural division in 1923 or
1920. On the latter occasion Cooroora had
an electoral population of 6576 -616 more
than the quota—spread over 840 square
miles. It contained more electors than
closely-settled Labor constituencies like Bris-
bane (6610 electors, Og sq. mile). South
Brisbane (6502 electors, 1 sq. mile) and
Rockhampton (5426 electors,’, Of sq. mile), and
nearly as many-as Paddington (6624), For-
titude Valley (6644) and Maree (6660), all
under 2 sq. miles, while it outdistanced
the population of such Labor pocket-boroughs
as Flinders (4190 electors), Cook (4557),
Gregory (4560), Ckillagoe (4574), Mt.
Morgan (4602), Charters Towers (4662),
Balonne (4779), Burke (4915), Bowen
(4924) and Mitchell (5117). Yet after the
redistribution of seats carried out under
Labor-Socialist auspices, the M.L.A. for
Cooroora found himself with 7837 consti-
tuents inhabiting 1120 square miles of rural
territory, whereas the 16 Labor districts
mentioned contained exactly the same area
as before, while the number of registered
electors had slumped to 2161 in Flinders,
3596 in Gregory, 3900 in Burke, 4070 in
Cook, 4191 in Balonne. 4237 in Charters
Towers, 4419 in Mitchell, 5831 in Brisbane,
6270 in Paddington and 6478 in South Bris-
bane. Whatever the “revised” Queensland
rolls may say, it would be safe to wager
that the Cocky-Nationalist member for Coo-
roora represents more flesh-and-blood electors
than the Labor members for Burke, Gregory
and Flinders (Attorney-General Mullan
sits for Flinders) combined. This indicates
how hard it is to get rid of the Continuous
ci’owd, even though (as generally happens)
it polls a minority of the votes, after making
a liberal allowance for uncontested elec-
tions. As regards next month’s affair, the
Government’s fate will be decided in 14 elec-
torates, which may be classed as “doubtful. ’
the names of which, and the voting in 1923.
are subjoined:—

Eacham . . ■ ■ 2641 1809 832
Eacham is included because tbe Labor
majority was reduced to a mere 166
in ' the' by-election consequent upon ex-
Premier Gillies’s appointment to the
Board of Arbitration— Gillies, had been
member for the district since 191*,*
Townsville and Port Curtis were repre-
sented by Oppositionists m the 1418-
21 Parliament; on this occasion 1 . W.
Paterson, the former Rhodes scholar
who played a conspicuous part in tbe railway
strike, is standing in Port Curtis as a mili-
tant industrialist, and the factional feel-
ing is such that it is questionable whether
Carter, the official Labor nominee, will get
many of Paterson’s second votes. In any
case contingent voting is optional in Queens-
land. Fitzroy. Kennedy and Cook are very
difficult from the Labor point of view, and
so are Maree (represented by Speaker Bert-
ram) and Metliyr, where the Labor majori-
ties at tbe 1920 election were, respectively,
149 and 200. Again, the Federal voting in
November has brightened the Opposition s
prospects in Gympie, Ipswich and Kelvin
Grove, and the Labor selection-ballot in
Ithaca, which resulted in the rejection of
the old member, Gild ay, has left a trail ot
bitterness behind; nor can the crowd m
office regard Bulimba as a certainty. Three,
years ago A. H. Wright beat the Opposi-
tionist by 3956 to 3298 in Bulimba; this time
Costin, an Independent with Ivabor lean-
ings may cut into Wright’s vote. On the
other hand, several Cocky-Nationalists were
run pretty close in 1923— Nott had only 2o
votes to spare in Stanley, Brand 64 m bur-
rum Swayne 107 in Mirani and Peterson
257 in Normanby. To win the election the
Opposition will have to hold its present num-
ber of seats, and gain anything from eight
to a dozen, the more the better. If it per-
forms this difficult but not impossible task,
one of its first legislative proposals should
be a Redistribution of Seats Bill modelled
on the Federal arrangement, which is scrupu-
lously fair and lias worked well.
The City State.
Victoria has always given the country folk
more than their share of Parliamentaiy
members, believing that the country needed
them to look after its development. Had
they used their spare horse-power to create
one or two new ports and cities they might
have solidified their position and avoided the
present fuss. But. they only helped to de-
velop Melbourne, and now the discrepancy
between a country electorate with about 4000
voters and a city one with 71,000 is rousing
furious protest. If the State electorates are
re-adjusted according to population, like the
Federal ones, most of the country members
will disappear, and if the process of Metro-
politan Bloat continues others will disappear
later. Some people have a vision that a time
may come when Melbourne and suburbs will
return the whole Assembly save one member,
and that he will speak but not vote, like the
M.11.R. from the Territory, n the Com-
monwealth could only be endowed with the
nower of subdivision it would probably be
the best tiling to set up Melbourne and Syd-
ney and possibly other metropolises later
on with a little adjacent territory apiece, as
separate States, after the manner of Rio de
Janeiro Buenos Aires, Hamburg, Lubeck,
Bremen and a good many others, neither
trying to manage farming and pastoral
affairs nor being managed by wheat-growers
and cowmen themselves. That would end,
for tbe time at least, the quarrel about the
division of representation, and as eacli big
severed area would want a capital, and pro-
bably have ambitions to develop a port ot
its own decentralisation would get a move
on Then Victoria wouldn’t necessarily have
to’lose its Premier Allan, after all. When
the Country party removed to the country,
where it belongs, he could go with it, and amid
more fitting surroundings he could legislate
badly with one hand and milk the cow effi-
ciently with the other. Some bright young
country member, or even some dim old one,
might take up this scheme with a view to
saving his party from practical extinction
while it still has a majority to save itself
with. None of the old orthodox secession
projects include the idea of the City State.
Horsey, Keep Your Tail Up!
Above the bang and rattle of a community
given over to motor-transport, even above
the shrieks to Heaven of the pedestrian
casualties, a voice is sometimes heard cry-
ing, unheeded as the pelican in the wilder-
ness, a solemn warning against the growing
neglect of the horse. The latest of the pro-
phets is E. B. Comans, honorary secretary
of the N. S. Wales branch of the Common-
wealth Clydesdale Society. In a lecture at
the recent Sydney Show, this expert made
clear the folly of belittling an animal which
is, and always must be, a great national and
industrial asset, not only to Australia, but
to the world at large. This country is cer-
tainly notorious for its devotion to one type
of horse. Unfortunately that is the special-
ised racer, often useless for any other pur-
pose, since the catsmeat industry is not yet
established in this country, and even he is
only interesting because he is an excuse
for the community’s inordinate gambling
proclivities. The standard of the highly-
bred riding-horse that was once an even more
widely-appreciated product of Australia than
her wool has sunk to dwarfish dimensions.
Buyers have had to turn to other markets, or
set about breeding the required type them-
selves. Even the fact that this type of
horse, once world-famous as a cavalry
charger, is vitally necessary to the scheme
of Australian defence has not revived in-
terest in it or stayed its deterioration. The
downward progress which was. begun when
sheep supplanted cattle is being hastened
by the motor-car. The U.S.A., with all its
craze for the motor, has not neglected this
aspect, for it maintains over 400 stallions,
SO per cent, of them thoroughbred, for breed-
ing army types alone. The downward trend
in Australia is hardly less marked among
the draught types. The general-utility light-
draught horse is becoming increasingly hard to
find. Much of this is due to careless breed-
ing and the use of bad stallions, as well as
the prevalent fad that the tractor and the
motor-lorry are soon to relegate the draught
horse to the scrap-heap. Here, again,
America points the moral that, for some
purposes, the tractor and the truck are
never likely to oust the horse. There are
nearly 7,000,000 farmers in the IT.S.A. and
but 450.000 tractors. Only 10 per cent, of
these tractors are used on farms, which, on
the other hand, employ 20,000,000 horses
and mules. The cables told us recently that
one of the greatest of the New York carry-
ing companies had returned to the horse, as
cheaper, quicker and more efficient, for
short hauls: and Mr. Comans himself
quotes a big London firm as putting 1000
horses into work again. The present out-
look indicates that the next war in which
Australia is implicated will see this country
unable to horse adequately 50 per cent, of
its cavalry requirements. Mr. Comans sees
a remedy in a Horsebreeding Bill, and if
this was a Commonwealth enactment, and
thus enforceable throughout Australia, it might
do a great deal for what is at present a hap-
hazard undertaking. The idea of premiums to
approved stallions is excellent in its way:
but unless the standard of the mares is also
safeguarded the future holds little promise.
Indeed, the idea that any runt of a mare
will breed good stock to a good stallion is
one of the fallacies that have helped to lower
the quality of Australian horseflesh —a fal-
lacy which still remains popular, and can
only be eradicated by propaganda and legis-
lative action.

The 111-paid Queenslander.
Queensland’s Continuous Government is
now fighting for its existence under its
fourth Premier. Its weapons include gerry-
mandered constituencies, a much-suspected
ballot-box, an impossible list of promises and
a catalogue of the things it has already done
for the worker. These things generally re-
solve themselves into improved wages, which
are the prime necessity, for a man with suffi-
ciently improved wages can buy most other
benefits for himself. In this line the Con-
tinuous Government tells the people that it
has provided them with something extraor-
dinary : and being unaware that the Federal
authority issues a Labor Report and other
documents, the Northern toiler is apt to be-
lieve that he is blessed beyond the common
and to vote for the men who say
they brought him to that condition. A
condensed commentary on the matter is
supplied in the Federal Quarterly Statis-
tics. which lump manufactures of all sorts
and size-up the pay. The verdict given on this
evidence is that the Queenslander was in 1924
(latest figures) the worst-paid person of the
factory kind on the mainland. He was £8
Bs. per annum, or about Bs. 3d. per week,
behind the procession. His wages have
risen, as all wages have in this paper-money
age, but he hasn’t kept up with the move-
ment, for in 1915, when the Labor Govern-
ment took office, he was only £3 15s. lOd.
per annum to the bad. There was a boomlet
in 1917 and 191*. when the bright young
Government was spending lavishly and the
big taxes which were to result therefrom
hadn’t yet arrived; in that period the
Queensland wage-rate got above the general
level —in 1917 it was £7 14s. 4d. per annum
above. But even in that brief spell of bril-
liance South Australia, dry and devoid of
coal, paid its workers better than Queens-
land. and was further ahead of the proces-
sion. In 1918-19 and 1919-20 the inevitable
big taxes came, and prosperity began to dry
up; the Queensland pay-rate fell below the
average, and has been there ever since.
First Queensland became No.' 3 among the
five States of the continent. Then for a
while it was No. 4. In 1924 it achieved its
destiny and became No. 5, or the worst-
waged State of the continent. But for the
remarkable amounts earned by workers in
the Commonwealth-supported sugar industry
(the sugar-mill workers alone constitute 13
per cent, of the State’s factory-“hands ).
the position would be much worse. Yet a
much larger proportion of the Queensland
workers are men, and much fewer are women
and girls, than in the case of the Common-
wealth generally. The figures given in the
Federal Labor Report show that in the
matter of agricultural, pastoral, mining and
railway employees Queensland has the same

Boys from the Outposts.
1 >ear Bulletin, —Now that Australia’s own
infant is so well provided with assorted
schools and colleges, and has his educational
cake so lavishly sprinkled with concession
travelling rates, bursaries and scholarships,
it is time the Commonwealth gave some con-
sideration to the educational disabilities of
her step-children in the Northern Territory,
the Mandated Territory and Papua. That
these youngsters’ parents have torn them-
selves away from the picture-shows, theatres,
pony-racing and cheap beer, and have even
forfeited their votes, in an endeavor to make
these places supply the Commonwealth with
the copra, rubber, coffee, cocoa, hemp and a
lot of other essentials which she at present
depends on foreign-owned coolie countries for,
should at least entitle the aforementioned
youngsters to adequate educational oppor-
tunities. This they are not getting. When
I tell you that at Port Moresby, the chief
settlement and capital of Papua, there is
just one male teacher (third grade) to dif-
fuse knowledge to a schoolful of pupils of
both sexes, whose ages range from six years
to fourteen, you will see how deplorably in-
adequate the present educational fare is. The
chief concern is for the boys’ as they approach
their teens. They cannot acquire the
foundational knowledge necessary to develop
them into anything in particular, and drift
away from school with the merest modicum
of readin’, writin’ and Tithmetic into the
woeful ranks of the unskilled. Admittedly,
these places have not enough children to
warrant such schools as are desirable being
established here. But were the Common-
vvealth to establish at Sydney a “residen-
tial.” under a manager with disciplinary
powers, and at moderate cost to parents,
where boys from these parts would be gener-
ally looked after whilst attending metropoli-
tan schools, a step would have been taken in
the right direction. People in Australia
seem to see folk from these parts in a sort
of glamor of prosperity; but the sordid truth
is that, excepting a very few of the higher-
salaried Government officials, ministers of
the_ London Missionary Society, and an odd
civilian, very few earn anything above the
cost of living. It is ouite impos-
sible for the majority to afford their boys any
sort of education in “the South.” Some
parents have tried boarding their boys with
strangers whilst they attended metropolitan
schools, but this has very seldom been found
satisfactory. I can’t see any alternative but
a Commonwealth Government hostel. What
do you think about it? —Yours, etc., It. A

IhiE Bulletin’s article on “Sydney’s Sick
Hospitals” (S/4/'2G) evidently gave courage
to some of the desperate committees
of management, and, following a little
straight talk, the Lang Government pro-
mised to guarantee all their bank over-
drafts. But obviously something more
is avanted; the hospitals must be placed
upon a basis Avhich will prevent the accumu-
lation of a new oi'erdraft every year. The
overdrafts of three leading hospitals have
grown to large proportions—the Prince
Alfred, Sydney Hospital and the Royal
North Shore owe the banks £250,000 between
them —yet these places, with their large
revenues, are better off than some of the
others. The Balmain, which charges its
patients an average of £1 per week, has, by
A'ery strenuous cadging, lifted its revenue
in. three years from £5OOO to £15,000; but it
anticipates an expenditure of £20,000 this
year, and since January has only been able
to pay wages and a few hard-hearted trades-
people ivbo have dunned for their money.
Reckless spending, which has increased the
cost of living, has frightfully increased the
cost of hospital maintenance; on the other
hand the community has largely abandoned
the habits of thrift which included, even
amongst comparatively poor people, a sub-
scription to a hospital whose services might
be presently required by the household. It
is hard upon the hospitals, but it is poetic
justice that the representatives of the party
whose rotten doctrines and worse leadership
have largely produced the present predica-
ment should be given the problem of finding
a way out.

In Queensland an unemployed man can’t get
a job m a “preference” industry unless he
holds a union ticket covering the particular
work offering. He may hold tickets in two
or three other unions, but that’s no good.
He may offer to join the union which covers
his new job, but that’s no good either, unless
the union will accept him; and many of
the “preferred” unions are chary of accept-
ing new members. If the workless man
is lucky enough to obtain a union ticket of
the right brand he is immediately stuck up
for entrance fee (heavy, in some cases)
dues and levies. If he is too old, sloav or in-
firm to earn the award rate, he must obtain
a permit from the union secretary before
he can accept less. Opposition-leader Moore
promises to alter all this. He proposes to
make preference to unionists subject to the
following provisions:—
(1) Compulsory dues or levies shall not be used
in aid of any political party or party political
publication.
(2) A worker debarred from joining a union shall
have the right to work without membership.
(3) A reasonable time shall be allowed after secur-
ing employment for payment of union dues.
(4) A worker shall be required to hold only one
union ticket during any one year, that ticket
covering the employment in which he is mainly
occupied.
These provisions will be a boon to workers
engaged in seasonal industries, who have to
fill in with casual labor for the rest of the
year, and will be welcomed by many mem-
bers of the A.AV.U. “The right to work”
was strenuously advocated in the early days
of the Labor party. “One union one ticket”
is the ideal of the 0.8. U. It will be the
irony of politics if both reforms are achieved
by Nat.-Cockies in the teeth of opposition by
the latter-day leaders of Labor.

checked. Near Kuala Lumpur, in the same
country, malaria had almost wiped out the
labor force engaged on the same sort of job.
The engineers who erected some hydraulic
gates lost 14 slain by the vermin in three
months. White men would not sleep there,
and natives would only recruit for the death-
trap if offered exorbitant <jaji. Gunong
Pulai was taken in hand by white sanitary
engineers. Subsoil drainage removed stag-
nant water, constant oiling checked the pest
in the surrounding district, coolie lines and
overseers’ bungalows were completely en-
closed in wire-net. Result, a malaria admis-
sion rate in the first year of 151 per 1000,
and many of the cases were imported from
outside. This easily beats the record of the
Americans at Panama. That much-boomed
enterprise recorded a rate of 821 per 1000
after two years of careful preparation. And
the precautions amply repaid their cost in
cheaper labor and a more rapid completion
of the job.

“Cleveland”: “W.P.D.” (B. 25/3/’26)
estimates that cassava will give a yield of
from 10 to 20 tons per acre in N.Q. May I
point out that the yield of cassava per acre
is estimated by the Agricultural Department
of Queensland, which has never yet missed
a chance to boom anything, at eight tons?
G. W. Moniek Williams, in his “Power
Alcohol, Its Production and Utilisation,”
says that in selected U.S.A. soils the yield
runs up to 15 tons per acre, and that the
general average is nearer nine. He also
says that it does best on a dry, sandy soil
with little rainfall, whereas “W.P.D.” tells
us that it requires humid heat and a heavy
rainfall. Cassava is a greedy feeder, and,
“W.P.D.” notwithstanding, requires a lot
of cultivation, and goes down so deep that it
has not yet been decided whether a rural
workers’ or a miners’ award governs the
harvesting. “W.P.D.” has cassava looking
after itself when once planted, and from a
20-ton crop has up to 1000 gallons of power-
alcohol per acre. This means an alcohol
content of 50 gallons to the ton, though no-
body else seems able to get more than 40.
There seems, to be a strong tendency to make
loud noises in Queensland when a new vege-
table is discovered. But the lessons of cotton
have been well learned, and few eockies
are springing to attention over the new
“find” to date. _ The vegetable might be all
right, but there is going to be no frantic rush
into growing it, only to find that it is all
wrong.
“G.M.L.” : A leader in the Sydney Daily
Telegraph, inspired by travellers’ tales, has
been followed by a number of letters and
paragraphs denouncing Australia House in
London as a costly white elephant. There
are further insinuations that it is staffed by
over-paid high officials, with supercilious
English clerks in the junior posts, and com-
plaints of the lamentable ignorance of Aus-
tralia shown by those of the staff who answer
inquiries. It isn't always easy to ascertain
what these indignant people mean by “Aus-
tralia House.” I recently asked a traveller
who had been pouring contempt upon a
place of this name for its inefficiency and
extravagance, and discovered that his griev-
ance was with a private travel-agency
which rents offices in the building. For
the benefit of the next bandsman who
decides to beat this particular big drum, here
are a few facts. Australia House cost
£1,000.000, and is now reckoned to be worth
over £1,500,000. The rent from offices let
to private firms pays all rates and upkeep
expenses for the whole building, despite .that
various Commonwealth departments and the
Agents-General for all States except Queens-
land and Wlestralia absorb about half the
office space. The Daily Telegraph leader-
writer uses tlie phrases “the Australia House
department,’* with its “92 officers.” What is
this department? In Australia House are
branches of the Migration Office, whose
headquarters are at Melbourne, of the
Pensions Department, the Commonwealth
Line, the Commonwealth Bank; simi-
larly, there is a Supplies and an
Accounts Department, branches of Aus-
tralian trunks. The number of Com-
monwealth Government officials outside these
departments could be counted on two hands.
And within these departments the employees
are no more “superior” or “languid,” and
often less well paid, than similar officers
at home. Also, practically all adult officers
and all who answer inquiries are Austra-
lians. The staff of the Government depart-
ments at Australia House is as hard-working
a team as will be found in the home services;
they are certainly not over-paid ; and their
greatest trials are Australian travellers who
fancy that, because Australia House belongs
to their Government, they are going to get
from it something for nothing.
“S.N.R.”: “A Medical Alienist” (B.
15/4/’26) leaves himself open to the sus-
picion entertained by many men in the street
that an alienist, dealing as he does with
the mentally abnormal, tends to himself be-
come “peculiar.” He is neither impartial
nor logical in his statements and deductions.
If he is bent on condemning the hypnotism
of words, let him not confine his remarks to
those used chiefly in the Domain. Let him
exemplify his argument with words used also
in the best circles. Nor is he any more logical
than he is impartial. He says: “Each
member of the audience knows he is not a
slave.” He doesn’t. He may think he is, or
is not, but he does not know, since he is
incapable of marshalling the facts and weigh-
ing them. He may even—hypnotised by the
jingle of still more words—think and believe
he is the “master of his fate, the captain
of his soul.” But can he know? “Individu-
ally lie knows well that there is no such
thing (in the sense used by the orator) as
a master-class.” Does he? Well, he’s not
a Hilaire Belloc, who wrote “The Servile
State,” nor does he know as much as “A
Medical Alienist,” who recognises the
presence of the “German and Jewish
master-class” in Russia to-day. “A Medi-
cal Alienist” rails, too, against the
use of “the ugly and stupid word scab.”
Stupid it may be—the ignorant didn’t
invent the word—hut they are not so
stupid as not to wish to get rid of scabs
because they are “ugly.” In spite of “scab-
bing being a part of the process of healing—
an important part of the vis medicatrix
Natural,” they are unsightly, and as justifi-
ably removed from the industrial body by
aesthetic unionists as those on the human frame
are by the careful practitioner. “A Medi-
cal Alienist” is apparently in agreement
with Bismarck, who said: “The judgment
of the masses is sufficiently stultified and
undeveloped _to allow them, with the assist-
ance of their own greed, to be continually
caught by the rhetoric of clever and am-
bitious leaders.” But modern crowd-psy-
chologists believe this to be a false conclu-
sion, and hold that it is not the crowd that
is caught by the demagogue, but the dema-
gogue that is caught by the crowd. No: the
misuse of words and phrases is not the mono-
poly of any individual or of any class. The
French alone appear to have the gift of
coining apt words. _We Australians have to
content ourselves with borrowing words, as
we borrow coin.
Adopting a compromise arrived at by a sub-
committee of Ministers and representatives of
the parties concerned, the Vic. Cabinet has pro-
vided sites for a new Melbourne hospital and
educational buildings close to the University.
Nearly two-tliirds of the market site at the
northern end of the city is to be set aside for
the hospital. The other third will be used
for a teachers’ college and a hostel. There
are to be some structural changes in the
University grounds, and a block of 5-} acres
adjoining the general cemetery (it was for-
merly a cricket-ground) is to be comman-
deered for a high school. Before this trian-
gular. block can be touched Parliamentary
sanction must he obtained. It has never
been park land, but was set aside specifically
for an oval for the Carlton Club. The club
got a better spot and deserted it. There lias
been some fuss about assigning it for
a school and playground why, it is not
easy to understand. There was no scruple
about converting Melbourne’s first cemetery
into a Paddy’s Market extension.
“Cartot : Nearly all the cocaine smuggled
into the Commonwealth comes from Java;

Isn t it up to the Federal Government to

ernment that it would be a friendly act to
exercise a little more supervision over the
disposal of the deadly narcotic?

POLITICAL
POINT
including “harassing deficits, excessive taxa-
tion and dwindling population,” lies in an-
nexation to Victoria. Australia is nch in
dodgy expedients which avoid the big con-
sideration-r-that the country makes too little
and imports far more than it can honestly
pay for. The proposed union would leave
Tas. still an island, and would also leave the
Navigation Act where it is. Hobart, in-
stead of being a capital, would be an out-
port, the same as Portland. There would
be the advantage of sharing in the Allan-
cock Ministry at Melbourne, but even the
Melbourne people don’t think very much of
their Allancock Ministry. As regards ex-
cessive taxation,” Tasmania taxed its people
last year some £3 per head more than Vic-
toria did; on the other hand, Victoria eked
out its revenue with £5 Bs. 6d. more loan
money per head than Tasmania did. So it
is difficult to see what Small Sister would
gain apart from the saving of Governor
O’Grady’s salary; and he is so cheap that
this paper believes he was got at a before-ten
sale.
The compulsory signing of political items
while a Federal election scuffle is in progress
is being inquired into by a Parliamentary
committee. The plan is more foolish than
anything else. Thus in case of difficulty one
Bruce and Page have revived their plan
of abolishing the per capita payments to the
States and letting them have the income-tax,
except as regards companies. One great ob-
jection to this is that it would continue the
maddening duplication that goes on in nearly
every department of direct taxation. There
would still be Commonwealth and State in-
come-taxes, Commonwealth and State land
taxes, Commonwealth and State amuse-
ment taxes and Commonwealth and State
death duties, along with mountains of un-
necessary returns, the preparation of which
involves fresh taxes, and a superfluous army
of assessors, collectors and so forth. What
should be aimed at is the educing of order out
of chaos, a thing which could be accomplished
by the Commonwealth reserving the income-
tax for war-debt and war-pension purposes,
abandoning to the States the taxation of
land, amusements and dead men’s property,
and, instead of paying them the 255. per
head, taking over a proportion of their debts.
That is the only sort of settlement that
will last.
It is impossible to see why a person who
draws £2OO from a manufacturing company
should be looted of £5O, while a similar income
derived from private bookmaking or drink-
selling went free. Company investment _ is:
to a great extent the refuge of the small in-
dividual. As a case in point, live British
banks have a combined capital of £60,473,352,
but it is divided among so many that the
average belonging to each capitalist is £219.
It would be far more equitable to free com-
panies from income-tax altogether, except
as regards that part of their profits which
belongs to absentees, and lay for the indi-
vidual shareholder.
The Federal Committee on Electoral lie-
form, which has been taking evidence in
Sydney, was told the other day (1) that the
East Sydney roll used last November con-
tained 5000 “dummy” names; (2) that a
woman (name and address given) boasted of
having voted 29 times for the Labor man;
(3) that the president of a Labor league
(name and address given) distributed pre-
pared slips containing a dozen “dummy”
names; and (4) that one small house was
given as the address of 19 electors, although
“you couldn’t get 19 people into the house
if you strapped them to the clothes-line.”
The witness described himself as a publicity-
agent who had been a paid organiser for the
Labor party and afterwards an honorary
organiser for the Nationalists. His asser-
tions may be disproved, but they will focus
attention on the fact that existing electoral
arrangements afford no protection against
the criminals who fake selection-ballots in
divers 'ways.
As was to be expected, Melbourne Age
thinks the remedy for Tasmania’s troubles,
way is to sign the yarn John Jones, with
an address on board a steamer which has
just taken Jones to sea. There are composite
articles and paragraphs in which at least
three men have a hand. The Bulletin con-
fesses quite cheerfully that in its own case
some of these used to be signed by the typist
who reduced the spidery MS. to readable
“copy.”
Someone or something having offended him
again, the swollen-headed N. S. Wales Pre-
mier is not going to the conference respect-
ing the Federal financial arrangements with
the States. Young Mr. McKell may be sent
instead. McKell has a “good press, ’but it
neglects his financial attainments, if any.
And perhaps he, too, will stand on his dig-
nity and send Sam Blubberlips, the Sene-
gambian Terror.
Labor Governments are notoriously suscept-
ible to appeals for the release of prisoners;
but the limit was probably reached when
Kirwan, Queensland Minister for Works, was
asked point-blank on the platform in Brisbane
the other night: “Will you, if elected, obtain
the release of James Duvey, under sentence
of 24 years for robbery with violence?” The
candidate didn’t explode. Instead, he humbly
replied that the Home Secretary had agreed
to remit three months of the sentence.
The chief speaker at an anti-secession
meeting in Hobart the other night managed
this: —
What folly it is to suggest that we can use a
threat of secession in order to extract a fair deal
from the Commonwealth! The enormous disabilities
secession would impose upon Tasmania are of course
as plain to Federal Ministers and members as they
are to us. If we brandish the big stick of secession
we may be quite certain that some mainland critic
will promptly put his finger through it and prove
it to be only a bubble.
It won’t secede, of course, with or without
a big stick, because, for one thing, Australia
will do the fair thing by it; but, frankly,
what would Tasmania lose by secession?
Certainly not its liberty under the British
flag; at any rate, Australia would be just
as interested in preventing that whether the
islet was outside or inside the Federation.
When the Walsh and Johanson deporta-
tion controversy was raging, the loudest
screamers against the invasion of the liberty
of the comrade to make a pest of himself
were Jock Garden and other self-confessed
worshippers of Soviet ideals. One would
like to hear their opinion of the treatment
of Harry Toogood, a leading British Corn-
ON HIS DIG.
“Premier Lyons of Tasmania strongly objects to any conditions being attached to the grant of
Federal money A private member recently introduced a bill to the Tasmanian Legislature authoris-
ing a loan of £2000 for a tennis-court and croquet lawn in his constituency.

munist, who, according to the cableman, has
just been booted out of Russia, where he
has been living and lecturing for the past
two years, much as Tom and Jacob did here.
No board was appointed to investigate
charges against Toogood. He was just
thrown out, and, though he is indignant,
Moscow is not worrying.
Sir jo Ward, who a few months ago was
warning Maorilanders to look out for a
period of financial stringency and urging
them to put the soft pedal on importations,
gets corroboration in the March-quarter
banking averages, which show advances and
discounts of the Shivery Isles’ banks to be
nearly a million in excess of deposits. Com-
pared with the previous March quarter the
set-back, in decreased deposits and increased
advances, amounts to over seven millions.
Latest trade returns, too, show a balance of
exports over imports not nearly sufficient to
pay interest on foreign debt.
It. is now alleged that the widening of
Park-street, Sydney, for which £500,000 has
already been borrowed by the remarkable
City Council, will cost another £500,000.
And it is only one street out of many. When
the mix-up was in its early stages his Lord-
ship the Mayor reported that the “owner’s
valuation” of the John Wren property was
£250,000, and that it could probably be
acquired for less. The municipal valuation
was first £201,000 and then £267,000, but it
now seems that the real demand is for
£500,000. New trouble has arisen over the
attempt to appoint a municipal ‘publicity
officer” at £550 per annum. What the crowd
in power really needs is. an obscurity officer.
Publicity is pouring in like rabbits.
The election campaign in Queensland is
remarkable for the number of things the
Ministerial party is not mentioning. No
one expects it to say anything about the
£12,000,000 railway deficit, or the £40,000,000
increase in the public debt, or about the
bankrupt State enterprises; but it has
dropped even the measures forced upon it by
the Southport Labor Convention. That Con-
vention insisted upon a governmental inves-
tigation of the Abrams treatment,, an increase
in the unemployment dole and limitation of
profits. Labor Parliamentarians are as
silent on all these subjects as they are on
the Mungana affair.
Scenting a general election, Vic. Labor is
calling for applications from comrades ambi-
tious of contesting seats not held by other
comrades. The P.L.C. wants to contest 24
seats besides the 28 already occupied. If
out of the 24 it can succeed in winning six it
will be more than satisfied. While Labor
is thus planning the crowd on the other side
is squabbling and subdividing its three sec-
tions into six or more. It seems a pretty
terrible thing to long for another Tommy
Bent; but Bent did at least round up all the
Libs, into one yard, and established the two-
to-one majority which lasted for years.
Labor campaigners in Queensland are
making copious promises of child endowment
and of widows’ and orphans’ pensions. It
is all bait for flatheads. Child endowment
was taken up by Gillies just before he
scuttled out of office, and was dropped by
McCormack when he came in; it was taken
up again at the behest of the Labor Con-
vention, and will be dropped again after the
election. If McCormack had wanted child
endowment he could have passed a bill be-
fore Parliament rose. Actually, the “widows’
and orphans’ pensions” featured on Labor
placards Avere whittled down in his policy
speech to “pensions to widows with depen-
dent children,” which is merely a change of
name, as poor widows with dependent chil-
dren have for years been granted allowances
by the State.
If it proves true, as alleged, that some
Fremantle (W.A.) policemen have taken to
burglary, it is difficult to feel the orthodox
and proper indignation. The W.A. police-
man is poorly paid in a high-wage country.
He has no assurance of a pension when
played out. When it was known that the Eng-
lish marine strikers, armed with lethal
weapons, proposed to do gory deeds on Fre-
mantle wharves, the order given to the force
was practically to offer, a passive resistance
and be killed. After a quarter of their
number had been damaged they did some
damage in return, and took a few prisoners,
who were fined a trifle but didn’t pay. Later
a policeman who had arrested a seaman was
dismissed, it being alleged that he had taken
the wrong seaman. There is very little for
a man on so hopeless a wicket to do except
burgle.
In the three years to 1924 Queensland’s
total butter production was 152,622.1871 b.
and cost to produce —according to Price-
Fixing Commissioner Ferry—l9d. per lb. Of
this total 51.4 per cent, was exported and
realised 15.6 d. per lb., less freight and
charges. This meant that to return produc-
tion cost for the 74,191,1001 b. consumed in
Australia, the farmer had to get 22.57 d. per
lb., and still be out of pocket for the freight
and selling charges on more than half of
his output. It is a joyous part of the mad
business that the lower butter is in London,
the more the Australian consumer has to
pay up, or the greater the perish for the
Australian producer.
Boston (U.S.A.) Herald recently printed
some nasty and not very accurate things
about N.S.W. —a place which is evidently
becoming known. One of them, which roused
Sydney’s Herald to fierce and scornful con-
tradiction, read that “so burdensome have
these State and municipal debts become that
already we hear from Labor-party leaders
that repudiation is the only way out.” It
may be said that both Heralds are right
and both wrong. “Responsible” Labor leaders,
to avoid being thrown out of the party and
the emoluments by Irresponsible, have abso-
lutely accepted the Red Objective, and “the
socialisation of industry, production, distri-
bution and exchange,” and the whole Moscow
programme of confiscation and repudiation —
whereof Moscow itself seems a trifle weary.
But certainly no one “hears” from them in
advocacy of repudiation, especially when
applying to the “capitalist” for another loan.
They lead the double life in a clumsy fashion,
and sit cheek-by-jowl with raging Commu-
nists while pretending not to see them.
JEAN’S COMFORTERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Paris correspondent of the Times states
that on a recent day when the franc touched another
low record (139.95) the Chamber was engaged in
a protracted discussion whether or not to prohibit
the sale of babies’ comforters.”
“Oh, Jean!” they cried, “poor Jean Crapaud,
For pity we would spare you this;
The world must seem a weight of woe
With little of it yours to miss.
And now when we would waft a kiss,
Our duty ’tis to deal a blow—
More menacing than serpent’s hiss,
A whisper lays your credit low.
The days ahead look very lean.”
“Let’s talk of comforters,” said Jean.
“Oh, Jean!” they murmured, “Jean my old,
Your cheeriness is all in vain;
The truth we may no more withhold —
In ev’ry bank you’ve got a pain;
The wasting in each franc is plain;
Your system lacks life-giving gold
And loses still, and that amain;
Your bed may be the churchyard mould—
So sick a man we’ve seldom seen.”
“The baby’s looking well,” said Jean.
Good Jean, I thank you for the hint:
When earth, as well as sky, looks blue
And through a misanthropic squint
The straitened ways of life I view,
I’ll know at last just what to do;
Though serried debts that know no stint
Beset me, and the thick clouds through
I fail to see the smallest glint,
I’ll think no more of way and mean,
But talk of comforters —like Jean.

Last year’s results add to the glamor that
surrounds the name of this co-operative
office. Premium income in the Ordinary
branch passed the million mark and in the
Industrial the half-million. The expense
rate was 7.8 p.c. of total income compared
with 8 p.c. for 1924, 8.4 p.c. for 1923, 8.9
p.c. for 1920, 7.5 p.c. for 1919 and 8.8 p.c.
for 1914. These figures illustrate a phase
which promoters of the many young cos. now
struggling for business refrained from men-
tioning in the flotation period. Without ex-
ception, every insurance float since 1920 of
which this Column has record used the M.L.C?
as an illustration of the good things that
would come to shareholders. Not one ex-
plained the chief reason for the prosperity
which M.L.C. proprietors enjoy. The
expenditure percentages supply the omis-
sion. The M.L.C. it was the Citizens’
Life for its first 21 years won its
early successes by rigid economy: its man-
agement then as now kept the closest guard
on expenditure. With a couple of exceptions
the newcomers have made no serious en-
deavor to follow in the tracks of the office
on whose reputation and record they based
their share-selling. Instead of maintaining
a ruthless offensive against extravagance, the
majority of new managements, finding them-
selves in possession of share capital, pro-
ceeded to attempt things on a large scale;
opulent offices, expensive staffs, and other
capital-eating devices were common to most.
Business-getting under those conditions
would be expensive no matter what the
attendant circumstances, but with the old
offices maintaining their progress much of
the business captured by the young cos. has
not been of a good type: indeed, most of it
has lapsed after the first year or two. Under
the stress of the fervid competition costs in-
creased even in the case of the oldest offices,
but the M.L.C. succeeded in keeping in the
neighborhood of its old expense ratios. That
was perhaps its most notable achievement.
In 1907 tin; Citizens’ absorbed the M.L.A.,
a purely mutual office, and took its present
title. Even at that time it could claim to be
the “most economically conducted Life office
in Australasia,” its Ordinary expense rate
being 8.1 p.c. of total income and 10 p.c. of
premium income. The M.L.A., which was
then 39 years old, could only show 16.2 and
22.4 p.c. respectively. Two years later the
Widows’ Fund (also mutual) came in; its
figures, after 38 years, were 18 and 25 p.c.
The Citizens’ in each instance guaranteed
that costs would not exceed 15 p.c. of total
income. Policy-holders of the two old mutual
offices have had a wonderful time. Last
year’s surplus exceeded 106 p.c., sufficient to
provide a compound reversionary bonus (a
bonus on the amount assured plus accumu-
lated bonuses) of £3 p.c.; this means that
policy-holders are receiving more than the
amount paid in premiums. Policy-holders in
both of the old societies have their interests
watched by trustees, and those representing
the A.W.F. felt it necessary, in view of the
new record established, to express their
appreciation :
The cash surplus allotted to the “A.W.F.” policy-
holders is equal to £lO3 9s. 7d. of each £lOO of
premiums received. It is expected that this exceed-
ingly liberal rate of bonus of £3 per cent, compound
will be maintained for several years to come*, and
probably, in individual years, special rates above
this figure may be again declared. This year’s
distributed surplus, if divided as a reversionary bonus
calculated on the sum assured only (as is customary
in Australia), would equal £4 ss. per cent, oil
policies of all classes, a rate probably never exceeded,
if equalled, by any other Life Office in any part of
the world.
A lily which needs no paint.
M.L.C. policy-holders get their share: re-
versionary bonuses of £3 4s. on 10-year poli-
cies ranging to £4 4s. on the oldest. The
total surplus of cash income over expenditure
was £524,152, of which actuary Miller re-
commended that £523,954 be distributed; this
will provide reversionary bonuses of
£740,000. Liabilities under policies in tlu:
Ordinary branch are calculated on the
assumption that funds will earn only 3 p.c.
That means extra security for policy-holders
in the present and substantial bonuses in tbe
future, actual earnings being well in excess
of 3 p.c. In 1914 the rate was £4 16s. Bd.;
in 1924 a shade over £5 55.: last year it
jumped to £5 9s. Id. p.c. The increase was due
to the exchange of Government securities for
others yielding a higher rate, and the office
states that the full result will not be visible
until the accounts covering 1926 are pub-
lished. The improvement has been won,
moreover, without disimpfoving the composi-
tion of securities—indeed the percentage of
gilt-edged stocks increased. This comparison
with 1924 discloses the changes :

Liabilities . . 3,084,622 1,819,159
Net assets ..£13,631,194 £15,316,480
That comparison shows that the last of the
heavy borrowings by the M.L.C. for the pur-
chase of Government stock —the original
arrangement, despite ill-based political cri-
ticism, was all to the credit of the co. —is
being liquidated. The net result of the move-
ments is a still further increase in the hold-
ing of public securities which, at 88.6 p.c.
represent extraordinary strength.
With such solidity it is little wonder the
co. can win a steady amount of new business
at small cost. Last year’s business figures
were a shade bigger than 1924’s and the
average amount of cover taken up better
than most: —

1925.. 10,459 3,111,194 297
Assuming that new business costs 10 times
as much as old, last year’s new business was
written at a cost of 74 p.c. On the 7 p.c.-
for-renewals basis the cost of new business
was 77 p.c. That was not so good as the
previous 12 months’ record, but the move-
ment was of no material consequence. When
most of the new cos. have cut back outgo
to within 20 points of that they will be doing
well.

The expense rate was 27.1 p.c. of total in-
come and 84.8 p.c. of premiums. For 15)24
the figures were 28 p.c. and 34.9 p.c. re-
spectively, and 30.3 p.c. and 37.7 p.c. for
1923. The rate of interest in the Industrial
is assumed to be 3-1 p.c. for policies 14 years
(or less) in force and 4 p.c. on older policies
whereas the actual return has been around
5 p.c. for some time. It leaped 11s. lOd. p.c.
last year, reaching £5 12s. 3d. ■ p.c., and it
will be higher when the next accounts are
published. Thus in the net liability of
£2,402,415 estimated by actuary Miller there
is a strong reserve for the benefit of policy-
holders. It is from the Industrial depart-
ment that shareholders receive most of their
profit; but policy-holders are guaranteed
that the amount assured will be paid, and
the co.’s capital backs that guarantee. Apart
from the economical manner in which the
business is handled, the reserve which is
hidden in the assumption of a lower rate
of interest than that received, plus the re-
serves that are hidden in the co.’s assets, adds
to the general strength. If the proprietors
were div.-hungry they could easily re-arrange
matters so that they received much more
and still be w T ell within the safety zone.
Shareholders can also take up to one-fifth of
Ordinary profits; which means that the
management has to save at least £4 for
them in order to get £1 for shareholders.
Actually policy-holders are more handsomely
treated: last year they got £6 for every £1
which shareholders received from Ordinary
profits. In all divs. amounted to £170,000—
£lO,OOO increase over 1924. Of the amount
£25.000 came from the Accident branch. As
paid capital is £200,000 the return is very
rich; but there are few if any to whom it
represents the full 85 p.c.

Although the Bank of Adelaide has branches
in Melbourne, Sydney and Perth, its chief
field is its thrifty home State; and its thrifty
home State, notwithstanding a recent notable
increase in manufactures, is still mainly de-
pendent on wool and wheat. That fact
largely governs this bank’s progress and is
reflected in its earnings. It is not surprising,
therefore, that profits last term should have
slipped back a little from the exceptionally
handsome figure of the previous year, when
phenomenal prices were got for the State’s
staples. The margin between net income and
the amount distributed last year was the
narrowest since the div. rate was lifted to
10 p.c. eight years ago; nevertheless, there
was still £17,233 left for reserves, which,
were very comfortably proportioned at
£824,974 —within £50,026 of paid capital. It
may reasonably be assumed that contingen-
cies were not neglected either. They cer-
tainly oughtn’t to be, because there are a
whole mob of contingencies in front of us,
including a very savage one—the probability
that we shall have to stop public borrowings
later on. As the present condition of Tas-
mania helps to show, even the gradual stop-
page of borrowing will make us feel very
sick ; a sudden stoppage would probably make
us wish we had never been born. And the
worst of it is the slowing down or stoppage
will almost certainly take place just when
our other conditions are worst.
Last year’s changes in the Bank of Adel-
aide's balance-sheet were nowhere serious:—
Liquid
Deposits. Assets. Advances.
1914 .. £4,834,739 £2,988,615 £3,128,104
1919 .. 5,365,076 2,176,522 4,424,338

1922 . . 6,545,112 4,087,129 3,991,579
1923 . . 5,853,069 3,220,147 4,478,926
1924 . . 6,143,317 3,315,369 4,686,169
1925 . . 6,317,889 3,805,303 4,436,198
1926 . . 6,453,083 3,791,891 4,623,226
Deposits were thus £135.194 greater and
advances moved up £187,028. But an exact
analysis is impossible owing to the move-
ments of State Government funds: these
are not shown separately. The liquid posi-
tion eased a trifle, but the strength which
has always been a feature of the Adelaide
was still evidenced, 54.5 p.c. of all liabilities
being held handy, compared with 56 at the
previous balance. With most of its risks
in one State, the bank doubtless considers it
wise to maintain that high proportion,
although 40 p.c. is usually accepted as
adequate. The same motives are visible in
the proportion of the bank’s own funds in
relation to those of the public. To bold £8
for every £1 of a bank’s own money is gener-
ally reckoned safe enough in the case of Aus-
tralian banks; the Adelaide holds only about
half that much. Of the outside liabilities at
March 29 more than half were covered by
cash, public securities and other liquids;
for the balance (£3,157,712) there were
£4,623,226 of advances and £278,209 of
premises, both written down. Thus the
whole of the hidden reserves and
more than a third of the book value
of those assets could vanish before a
shilling of outside money would, be in
jeopardy. The Adelaide apparently realises
the wisdom of spreading its risks a bit more
(risks of course include deposits) ; hence the
Sydney branch will shortly move tom its
present unobtrusive offices into a new home
which is now under construction in George-
street.

It was a successful year; much more suc-
cessful, in fact, than those ngures suggest.
Advantage wae taken of the robust profit to
appropriate £15,000 . for employees’ shares
and a superannuation fund. “Staff partners."
as those who hold employees’ shares are
called, received T p.c. as compared with 5
p.c. for 1925, flue distribution representing
£3905 compared with £2470. Thus the net
profit of £64,241 (£48,353 in 1925) disclosed
by the accounts, was allocated: Pref. shares,
£5600 ; ordinaries, £37,500; staff-partnership
divs., allotment for certificates and super-
annuation fund, £18,905; £2236 added to re-
serves. At Feb. 28 reserves amounted to
£111,743, but goodwill is in the books at
£65,702, and tha|t is not accounted an asset
in the introductory table. Reserves are not
over-substantial considering the capital:
£380,000. Distribution close up to earnings,
however, is part of a definite policy. The
Board does not favor accumulations for
future distribution as bonus shares; it takes
the attitude, broadly, that existing share-
holders are entitled to current profits. Which
means that divs. will fluctuate with income.
At February 28 the “staff partners’ ” and
superannuation fund amounted to £72,200.
Amouiits allocated to employees over the past
eight j*ears have been as follows :
Certi- Divs., Certi- Divs.,
ficates. etc. ficates. etc.

Four of the six directors are Wunderlichs,
who are an unusual combination of the artis-
tic, the altruistic and the commercial; and
from the commercial point of view they jus-
tify their large allotments to employees by
the claim that, for one thing, the feeling of
“interest in the business” reduces waste in
operations where waste is easy and very ex-
pensive. The long succession of divs. of
10 p.c. or more, notwithstanding the large
goodwill item, seems to justify the policy.
Inabilities were £62,790 more than in
1925, but the position was still very strong:

Premises and plant bulk largely in the bal-
ance sheet and depreciation is an important
matter. No mention is made of the annual
provision, but the directors affirm that it is
ample. The process of expansion continues:
the management is alert in meeting new de-
mands created by changes in the construc-
tion of big city buildings. Providing the
allowance for depreciation has been suffici-
ent the co. should go on to even better things.
At the same time, investors have to remember
the policy that has been followed in the mat-
ter of the distribution of profits ; and whether
building will continue on the recent scale
is also a matter for consideration.

It lias been a tough tight, and the manage-
ment has done well to regain even as much
ground as it has done, considering the fright-
ful mess that was uncovered when the
collapse of prices in 1921 forced a cleaning-
up. Whether the profit claimed for the past
year was actually made is by no means
certain, though. The directors frankly
direct attention to an item, “London sus-
pense, £lO,OOO, which appears in the London
accounts as a capital asset.” They have
their doubts, and managing-director Longland
(his status was raised from g.-m. during
the year) will “thoroughly investigate” the
matter during his forthcoming London visit.
The co. wasn’t helped much by circumstances
last year. It lost by death Herbert Wicken-
den, chairman of the London board and chief
Duyer; the British seamen’s strike kicked it
when it was just getting up; and two old-
established Flinders-lane firms hit the market
in its tenderest spot by cleaning up stocks.
Results for the first part of the year showed

Hiv was paid on the cum. prcf. shares,
squaring things up to July, 1924. Anticipa-
tions for the second half were realised so far
•is turnover was concerned, but the factors
mentioned cut down the profit: the gross
for the year was £108,053, compared with
£136 996 for the previous 12 months. Ex-
penditure, apart from debenture interest,
was £lO,OOO heavier —an unpromising de-
velopment that should have been given a
few words in the report. Balance-sheet
movements were in the right direction, but
that is as much as can be said: —

Although creditors are well enough secured,
the outlook for shareholders is far from
bright. It has been an unfortunate business
right from the beginning. The public became
interested in 1912 on prospectus Promises
of profits which did not crystallise until the
post-war boom years. In the slump which
followed loss was heaped on loss, the total
for the four years 1922-25 being £290,2 <3.
There were managerial changes and business
reorganisation, and capital was written down
by £110,625. The present balance-sheet
figures may be taken as honestly representing
the position, even though the Melbourne
freehold was written up by £20,000 in 1925.
The management has succeeded m holding
much of the business, and is apparently fully
aware of the difficult task ahead. And that
is a task not confined to this house, ine
way of the general softgoods importer is
becoming more and more difficult as the
specialty house and the Australian manufac-
turer grow in number and strength. Fret,
divs. will be two and a half years in arrear
by next balance, which means that the neces-
sary provisions will have to be made and
£16,250 handed out to prefs. before ordinary
shareholders can have attention. And, as
there is £184,375 of ordinary capital, even
a modest 5 p.c. calls for £9218 clear of the
liability to prefs.

Big business walks about Australia in
seven-league boots these days. The sale of
the Anthony Hordern business for £2,900.000
has been followed by Marcus Clark and Co. s
purchase for something like a million of the
premises, stock and goodwill of Craig, Wil-
liamson Proprietary, of Melbourne. The
Craig-Williamson business was established
45 years ago in Blizabeth-street, where its
real estate alone is worth half a million. The
romance of the Hordern business goes back
to 1821, when Anthony Hordern arrived in
Tasmania to take up a grant of land. If he
and his wife had cared for farming there
might have been no Palace Emporium; as
they didn’t they in 1823 moved on to Sydney
and set up in business. The Baillieus are
interested in the float at the Melbourne end,
where most of the business has been done;
Titmus and Quinan were the Sydney
brokers. All the shares were taken before
the public knew anything about it. Marcus
Clark’s will presumably want capital; it
will be very easily got. This progressive
firm considered the purchase a while ago of
a very old-established Sydney business; but
nothing came of that. In Sydney it has
built up a high reputation as a time-payment
general-supply house.

From a man who knows the area:—
Alluvial Gold and Platinum Mines, Ltd., Burra
(N.S.W.), will have difficulty in living up to its
prospectus—if it lives at all. Of the area men-
tioned —80 acres —perhaps five are worth looking at;
on my testing, the quantity carrying the values
stated is nearer 70,000 than 700,000 c. yards. For
the rest the ground is rocky or shallow and unsuitable
for hapdling by any method known to me. If,
which I doubt, the proposition would warrant a
water supply, the rainfall is very poor and the
area outside the artesian belt. The district has
been extensively prospected —it is 12 miles from
Fifield —and prospectors who tried the area before
me told me that they did not know of any platinum
having been produced at Burra.

Stackpool’s Crystal, Ardlethan (N.S.W.),
crushed 101 tons for 4 tons 14cwt. concen-
trates. Half of the tonnage came from the
open cut, and was thrown in as a test. The
little show, fostered by Melbourne folk,
would be O.K. if it were able to mill con-
tinuously, but its deposits are bunchy. If it
comes to that, what lode-tin deposits are not?

Broken Hill Prop, has taken £lO,OOO
worth of shares and debentures in the West-
ralian Manganese Co., and has been given
representation on the board. Rails and
sleepers have been ordered for the line which
is to connect the eo.’s deposits with the
railhead at Meekatharra.

“O.B.” (W.A.) : The death of Herbert
Moir in London last month revives memories.
Moir was in the first flight of Kalgoorlie
boomsters 30 years ago, and engineered a
number of promotions. The best-known was
Hannan’s Prop., which acquired nearly the
whole of the eastern side of what was after-
wards known as the Golden Mile. One
hundred of the principal speculators of Lon-
don were £lOOO subscribers to this float,
and when the prospectus was issued there
was a wild rush by the public for shares,
and many millions were put up. Moir in-
vested some of liis profits in Perth bricks and
mortar, but the bulk of them never left
London. Later he cut his connection with
the West and got the itch for Nigerian tin.

Wiluna Development Syndicate (W.A.)
broadcasts the news from London that share-
holders applied under the underwriting
scheme for 52,839 shares in the Wiluna
Gold Corporation and let outside parties
take up the remaining 22,161. It also
passed over the right to call 283,000 shares
in the Wiluna Gold Corporation to the afore-
said outside parties, who will receive 82,000
free shares in the event of exercising such
call. This will mean that instead of the
Wiluna Syndicate shareholders receiving
187,000 shares in the Wiluna Gold Corpora-
tion-equal to about four shares for every
one now held —they will receive 105,000 or
shares for every one now held.

Kanowna Red Hill (W.A.) potters along.
Latterly only a small margin of profit has
been obtained from ore treatment, but the
co. hopes to strike another rich patch by
and bye. Meanwhile a cash reserve of about
£3OOO is carefully held, as a new shaft may
have to be sunk very shortly on account of
the reef flattening and getting away from
the present one. In the hands of a co. which
has been willing to bog in and fossick here,
there and everywhere, the show has done
very well to date.
* * * *
Hampton Celebration (W.A.) will soon be
buried. A deathbed meeting of shareholders
will be held in London this month, and the
undertaker is certain of a job early in May.
The Bulletin remarked some time ago that
the life of the co. hung by a very slender
thread. A fair quantity of gold has been
won, but not nearly enough to pay exes.;
in view of its failure in this respect it is
surprising that the co. survived two recon-
structions. # #
Reefing at Warrandyte has been a hatter’s
job ever since the bottom blew out of George
Dickenson’s Caledonia. Not that it was any
great shakes—though the market got the
idea that it was —for the runs of ore were
too narrow and the shoots too short to keep
up divs. Now some alluvial has been alighted
upon in the river-flat near the pub, and a
night pegging out of ground furnished a tip-
top chance for the dailies to splash big head-
ings. All that has really happened is that
another small shoot has been found and
a bit of sinking has yielded a few bags
of decent-grade stone. The shoot may carry
beyond the claim boundary. If so, Warran-
dyte’s luck has changed.
* * • *
Since the Goldsborough moved to Maldon
the sun has smiled. Most district formations
are big, but they generally stand amid the
road-metal group. Otherwise Maldon would
boom like the Golden Mile. Now Golds-
borough, with an intermediate level at 185tt.,
thinks it has a bonanza. This is because for
106 ft. south and 32ft. north it has developed
a reef averaging 5 to 10 ft. wide which in
the northern section is freely said to average
an ounce a ton. A trial lot of 325 tons gave
15dwt. a ton over the plates, and so the window
is well dressed. But why is the board letting
the manager open up a level 15ft. below the
so-called intermediate level at 185 ft.? Tak-
ing the whole width of the shoot to be 10ft.
—which it isn’t—and its length 140 ft., about
six weeks’ crushing by a good battery would
see the new level worked out. Is there no
stone overhead at 185 ft.? If not, the proved
ore reserves are 1500 tons, which isn t much
to prod shares to a 28s. mark. With the mar-
ket strong, calls can be safely made and funds
be forthcoming for sinking a proper lift of
100 ft. A horrid thought is that, as shoots
of gold at Maldon are erratic, the right
thing is to freeze tight on to the shoot at
3 87ft. Even so, why not underhand stope
till the shaft is down to 50 or 100 ft. before
opening out?

Coal, Ltd., is getting rid of extraneous
assets, such as sawmill plant and stock of
firewood. Then one of its mortgages has
been renewed for three years. So everything is
shipshape for someone to put up cash for the
development of the coal blocks. The co. owes
about £lOO, and has cash and other liquid
assets of about £l2OO, so it saunters along
in comfort. The big asset nowadays is the
freehold valued at £6375, which, however,
carries a blister of £3200. The difficulty
with shows like Coal, Ltd., is that they are
so utterly dependent on a brand of labor that
is fond of making the innocent employer
suffer for the sins of the guilty.

The new find of osmiridium at the junc-
tion of the Huon and Weld rivers (Tas.)
made by the Rev. Fitzgerald and party is in
the known serpentine belt of country, and
hence may be important. The quality of
the metal is good, although nothing rich has
yet been unearthed. Many diggers are leav-
ing Adams River for the new field. Mining
is difficult, as there is an overburden of 10
to 15 feet in most places.
A nominal value of ss. for Lander Oil
shares obtains on the Sydney Stock Ex-
change pending the removal of the plant and
the starting of No. 3 bore. No. 1 has been
duly plugged under the requirements of the
Queensland Petroleum Act, and the third
bore will start on a site agreed upon by the
State and Federal departments interested.

The arrival of Dr. H. I. Jensen at North-
cote (N.Q.) to supervise operations at the
Antimony Mines, floated last month in Syd-
ney, has released a flood of antimonial litera-
ture in Cairns. Meantime the quiet con-
fidence of his reports resulted in large par-
cels of shilling scrip becoming marketable
at 3s. in Sydney. If, as Jensen’s backers
expect, he will develop and market pay ore
so rapidly that calls will not be levied on
those supporting the show, it will cer-
tainly be a freak among latter-day floats.
But it is just as well not to assume that
Dr. Jensen can’t go wrong. His disposition
is to give a bird the benefit of the doubt and
rank it with the swans and not the geese.

Manager Arthur Moore, of the New
Guinea Oil Co., Vailala River, thinks that
on a new field lightning drilling is not com-
patible with careful research. He adds that,
in conformity with this policy, records will
not be attempted. Yet the plant and its
crew are slick enough, the first 150 ft. being
penetrated in six days. After a hiatus for
casing, the next 100 ft. went down in four
days. The unanimity with which promiscu-
ous oil-stabbing in Australasia has failed pre-
cludes a market flutter till the New Guinea
co. delivers something resembling the goods.

Back in 1922 the bears almost completed
the knockout of Nawng Pet (F.M.S.) when
the 2s. 4d. shares were dumped below (id.
Liquidation was only averted by a member
of the board personally undertaking to reduce
the indebtedness of the co. by £1250 a month.
Thus it was that the co. started tin produc-
tion with a debt of £14,000 to shear off.
Since then £25,000 has been paid m divs. on
the 500,000 2s. 4d. shares. To-day the old
bear-squeeze is still being felt; but not in
the old way. Since the disastrous floods ot
November stopped production for over three
months, share values have been affected
hardly at all. At present, indeed, they are
moving up despite the official bulletin that
nothing but attenuated yields from one face
instead of fat ones from four need be ex-
pected till October at least. All of which
goes to show that Bruin has his uses as well
as his abuses.

Takuapa (Siam) has entrusted the con-
tract for its No. 2 dredge to Poole and
Steele, of Sydney and Adelaide, who were
the builders of No. 1. Sixteen months for
construction and an extra month tor de-
livery under steam and general good behavior
are specified. Electric power will be gener-
ated by Diesel engines, and the parts ot the
two dredges will thus be rendered inter-
changeable. G. M. Yetts, of Penang, field
manager of the liquidated Malaya Corpora-
tion, has caused a commotion by placing in
writing certain questions about a sum ot
£2OOO, said to have been received by George
Blakemore for “special services” m connec-
tion with Takuapa No. 1 dredge. Yetts
avers that Blakemore automatically vacates
his seat on the board under rule <3 by
accepting fees of any kind unless he be man-
aging director. Moreover, he queried tHake-
more’s qualifications as a specialist in tm
dredge construction and wondered whether
another £2OOO would be handed out m con-
nection with No. 2 dredge. The board re-
plied in effect that Mr. Yetts was a sorehead
whose services had been terminated by the
Malaya Corp. at a figure arrived at by nego-
tiation between himself and Blakemore: that
£2OOO was not paid by Takuapa to Blake-
more, “but the very reasonable sum of
£1200”: that the board took full responsi-
bility for No. 2 dredge, and that the Blake-
more payment was sanctioned by rules <4
and 75. . ,
Having been got off the rocks, Lampeli
(Siam) seems now to be sailing along
smoothly. Its first, blob was scored over the
cutter-dredge experiment: in 1924. That leL
the co. £21,809 in debt, of which £13,492
was claimed by the dredge-builders as due
for spare parts, renewals, etc. Having got
that claim cancelled, the co. has had the
bellman at work to sell the cutter, but can t
get a decent bid. Meantime a bucket-dredge
lias been ordered. Not from Australia but
from the Dutch firm of Conrad, Ltd. For
£10,250 it guarantees to have a 40,000 cub.
vd. bucket dredge delivered at a selected
Mala van port in seven months on c.i.f. terms.
Another £3OOO should put the plant on the
claim under steam. If the dredge works it
means that Australian builders under pre-
sent conditions will not have a look-m with
Holland over jobs of the kind. Labor s frac-
tiousness prevents a short-term guarantee
being given by any Australian contractor,
and costs of the plant are much higher.
Being £22,000 to the bad, fresh capital was
sot in by the co. through an issue of 50,000
?i in ner cent. cum. prefs. This cash has
wined out the debt, the £13,492 has been
written off by the builders and 20 p.c. has!
been paid to the Dutch dredge-builder. Not
bad going. Although the ground on which
the cutter plant lodges has been whittled
down by inspecting experts to a smallish
patch, what remains has been passed as
good. So Bill Dawson is satisfied that the
co. has a future. As a second string to its
bow it holds exclusive prospecting licenses
over 3000 acres. Dawson says that some
of this ground is reported by the original
owners to go 41b. oxide. Stuff worth that
cannot lie idle, so Dawson and Co. intend
to pick one or two experts to run their rule
over it.

Tantalum, a metal worth only about one-
twentietli as much as platinum, may oust
platinum from chemical laboratory equip-
ment. Platinum and platinum-iridium have
dominated the position because of their re-
sistance to chemical attack, and their scar-
city warranted very high prices. Tests with
tantalum have shown that it is well ahead
of pure platinum, and very little below plati-
num-iridium. In all acids except hydro-
fluoric, tantalum is insoluble. It even resists
aqua-regia, which finds weak spot in pure
platinum.

A gold-bearing reef has been discovered by
prospectors about two miles from the Adams
River osmiridium field (Tas.). One sample
of the ore sent to the Government Mines
Office assayed loz. 12dwt. The reef is on
the contact of two large bodies of quartzite
and serpentine.

“Devil’s Advocate”: During the past few
weeks an optimistic evangelist has posted to
every member of the Bar in N. S. JA ales a
neatly printed tract bearing the title is
Counsel Assigned?” It would be interest-
ing to know its reception. The writer pre-
faces his remarks: “I do not know' ot anyone
that the truth of religion should appeal to
so much as members of the legal profes-
sion.” His reasons are that they see much
of the results of sin and appreciate the need
of an advocate —and know 7 also something
about judgment (this in ominously black
lettering). Incidentally, the evangelist re-
marks that he is writing his tract sitting m
his pyjamas in the early hours ot the morn-

as readers who are used to their 100-guineas-
a-day briefs. The optimist should have en-

“Moreton”: Not all big lottery winners
spend their money foolishly. .Tack Thompson,
a Cliarleville (Q.) laborer, who had a halt-
share in a 15000 Golden Casket prize, applied
for a block in the Dillalah estate, one ot the
gone-bung State stations now 7 being cut up
for closer settlement. The Casket money
not arriving in time, Thompson had to
scurry round to raise the deposit; finally
he lodged his application with only one
minute to spare. He drew blanks in the bal-
lots for the first two blocks, but tor Block
No. 3 (his last chance) his marble went m
last and came out first. As the block com-
prises 19,456 acres at 3d. an acre, it: was
better worth drawing than the Golden
Casket prize. With a girl in the offing, a
villain or two and a lot of galloping and gun-
shooting, the story of Thompson’s luck would
make a Wild West scenario of the approved
pattern. , ,

a daily feature of

was called th e
“B aro meter of

thing equally fanci-
ful. It consisted
of a numbered
clock-face, on which
were two hands,
moved day by day
to keep tally of the
official New York
returns of deaths
by automobile and
by shooting respec-
tively. The date
of the paper was
January 30, 1020.
and the automobile
hand of the baro-
meter for the 29
days of that month
stood at 61, the
shooting hand at
24. “There used

The hair of the others ranges from flaxen
to jet-black, but for the last five generations
the third child born, boy or girl, has been a
copper-top. Is there any scientific explana-
tion? Apropos of colors, it is an established
fact that, though brown-eyed parents fre-
quently have blue-eyed offspring, tw T o blue-
eyed persons never produce brown-eyed chil-
dren. If both parents are brown-eyed, the
proportion of blue-eyed children they are
likely to have is one to four; but brown-eyed
progeny are denied to blue-eyed parents. I
write, of course, only of blue-eyed parents,
not of grey-eyed, nor of cases where the one
parent alone is blue-eyed.

“Soda”: Some enterprising safeblowers
struck a patch of cruel luck at Deewhy
(N.S.W.) the other
night. Very labor-
iously they had
plugged with gelig-
nite the keyhole of
a n ironmonger’s
safe, working at
high tension, for
the owner lived
near by, and adja-
cent shops w'ere
tenanted. After
some elaborate
packing with bags
and other material
to deaden the ex-
plosion, the fuse
was lighted. A
muffled bang fol-
lowed, and the
cracksmen dragged
away the packing
and tried the door.
I t was locked tight,
though the explo-
sion had caused a
lot of minor dam-
age, apd they re-
tired empty-handed.
There was nothing-
in the safe for
them to get, any-
how, a piece of in-
formation wh i c h
they must have
read with mixed
feelings in next
day’s newspapers.
But when they
went on to read,
on the authority of
the proprietor, that
the safe had not
been locked at all
before the opera-
tion, but that the
explosion had shot
home the locks, one
wonders if their
vocabularies were
adequate to meet
the case.

“T. Square” : As elsewhere, land values in
the vicinity of Liverpool-street (Sydney) ai e
jumping With joy as the time approaches tor
the opening of the Museum station, which
will take place in September, when the
underground to St. James’s gets going. Cor-
ner land in Liverpool-street sold nn 191 J
for £330 per foot is now worth £lOOO, and
Elizabetli-street land which went at £lOO pel
foot seven years ago is up to £»00. 0/Ollege-
street values have gone from £5O in IJIU to
£3OO. and even the side streets such as F ran-
cis and Stanley are exalting themselves.
Land there, costing £lO per foot before the
railway was mooted, is easily worth ilw.
Many'a fortune in land has been made here-
abouts. Giving evidence before a commission
which did some washing-up after the old
Wcxford-street resumptions, which led to the
making of Went worth-avenue, Arman d
Jerome testified that he made £14,000 over
options he had secured, without expending
a penny. Two institutions standing to benefit
bv the jump in values are Sydney Grammar
School, which will probably in time move
nearer to its playgrounds, and the Unitarian
Church.
“Macess”: Melbourne Annus tells of a

When first he took a wife on ;
Perhaps they “put a stick in,’’ say;
He sizzles now his life away,
A mere innocuous syphon.
No cave-man attitude is his;
By fate he claims he’s owed a
Big debt, since it reversed the biz —
Now hers the kick of whisky is,
While he’s the simple soda.

“Topee”: Thackeray was an expert in
minute caligraphy (B. 3/4/’2O), and one of
my family’s most treasured possessions is a
Christmas letter written by him to my
mother in 1852. It contains the Lord s
Prayer written within the area of a three-
penny-bit. Some old Bulletin readers may
remember a humble scrivener who used to
haunt Sydney bar-parlors in the ’seventies
seeking orders for visiting-cards, which he
would fulfil on the spot. On these occasions
he would produce a card on which the Prayer
was written three times within this restricted
space, the centre one in red ink and all down-
strokes thickened. Failing an order for
cards, he would offer to do the threepenny-
bit performance once if anyone would lend
him the coin. Before starting he would stare
fixedly at the .table, and on being asked why
he didn’t go ahead, would reply, “I could
have sworn I brought my beer in with me .
The ruse never failed.

Four motor-cars whisk them and their tents

IN MELBOURNE TOWN.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
“A blight lias fallen upon the plan adopted at tne
end of the war for raising a memorial in Melbourne
that fittingly should commemorate the sacrifices or
soldiers and sailors in the war. The War Memorial
Committee is breaking up. Of a large committee, the
majority took little interest in the work-
in Melbourne town they talked awhile
Of war and what their sons had done,
Of building them a stately pile,
Whose facets flashing to the sun
Should wake with every day begun
The memory of maid and man
Till all the sands of time had run
And every life outlived its span.
Anil over many a splendid plan
And many a neatly-numbered file,
As dutiful committees can,
In Melbourne town they talked awhile.
In Melbourne town they talked awhile
Of ways and means and wrongs and rights,
Of this or that or t’other style,
Of soaring spires and splendid sites,
While many measured out their mites
’Way back as far as Billabong,
And Woorup worked by days and nights
To build its plinth and build it strong;
While Sourgrass Flat and far Solong
Could see their columns mile on mile,
And yet about them made no song,
In Melbourne town they talked awhile.
Dear God! I must have dreamed awhile,
For rank on ghostly rank I saw
Of faces tortured to a smile,
Of broken bodies, foetid, raw,
That once into the bloody maw
Of brother-hate, that man had made,
Were fed, as one to fire feeds straw;
And as 1 watched that grim parade
That once was youth all unafraid,
Why, Lord, I wondered without guile
What might have happed if these had stayed
In Melbourne town —and talked awhile.

“Akran”: At the last. N.S.W. elections one
of the candidates for a northern constituency
was addressing a large crowd at a seaport
town. Interjectors were numerous, and the
spruiker’s patience presently broke down.

“Spenner”: Could this happen anywhere
except in Australia? About 75 years ago a
Frenchman named Duran was horsebreaking
on Ardno, Strathdownie (Vic.). He took a
great liking to one of the youngsters he had
schooled, and wanted to buy the colt. The
offer was refused. Duran worked on for
some time; then, saddling up the fancied
horse, he rode off. leaving the offered sum
in payment. Evidently he didn’t expect
pursuit, but the irate owner overtook and
shot him on a lonely bush track only a rew
miles from the station. The slayer tlieu
AND THEN THE CAT PURRED.

gave himself up to the police, and at the trial
which followed was acquitted on the ground
that he had acted in self-defence. Duran’s
body, rolled in a sheet of stringybark stripped
from a near-by tree, was buried almost on
the spot where he fell. A post-and-rail
fence enclosed the grave, but busli-fires have
swept the spot clear. Through public sub-
scription a more lasting memorial in the
form of a headstone has now been erected,
and the other Sunday settlers from near and
far assembled for the unveiling. As various
Bulletin contributors have been saying,
doubtless there are thousands of Australians
who have never been in a saddle. The real
bushman, though, not only still has an
affection for an ’orse, but is ready to think
well of almost anybody who is fond of the
animal.
“Wynyard”: Curio-hunters at Settlement
Island, Macquarie Harbor (Tas.), and else-
where attach a special value to bricks with
a thumb-mark because of the tradition that
the convict artisan stamped every tenth one
in this way. I doubt if they are not under
a delusion. As a
boy I lived close to
a brick-kiln where
bricks were made
before the advent
of machinery, and
have seen thou-
sands with the im-
print of a thumb.
This was simply
due to the brick-
maker pressing on
one corner of the
brick to help it out
of the frame. I
have watched the
process for hours,
an d no t many
would leave the
frame without this
help.

“Nakhoda”: Professor Colin Mackenzie,
director of the National Museum of Australian
Zoology, the other day told a small Melbourne
assemblage that a skull he had discovered at
< 'ohuna, in the Murray River district, was
older than the Piltdown skull, the Talgay, the
Rhodesian, and all other ancient craniums
hitherto uprooted. Whether he intended liis
statement to get the notoriety it did is doubt-
ful, but within 24 hours sceptical comments
were pouring in by cable from all parts ot
the world. The most weighty came from a
fellow-Australian in London, Elliot Smith.
He considers the possibility of the Murray
River district being the original incubating
place of man to be remote, evidence going to
show that the Piltdown man was living m

“Windsor”: Melbourne trammies’ “lazy”
•trike had its humorous incidents. The con-
ductor of a crowded electric, crawling along
St. Kilda-road, spoke severely to three pas-
sengers who were clinging to the step and
directed their attention to the regulation
prohibiting travel on that part of the tram.
The offenders refused .to budge, pointing out
that short of clambering on to the roof there
wasn’t any other means of getting carried.
When they alighted at Bourke-street. there-
fore, the conductor pursued them with note-
book and pencil, while an enraged crowd
fumed at the delay. Then a bright young
medical student rang the bell, and the motor-
man. in blissful ignorance of the conductor s
absence, continued on his way, the enterpris-
ing student controlling the bell until he him-
self had to alight. Then lie gave the
necessary two tugs and hopped off, while the
tram, still minus a conductor, rattled on
towards its destination.

“Leamington”: The present tonsorial
fashions are shattering the military belief
that the toothbrush moustache makes the
officer. During the recent Ist Division exer-
cise at Liverpool (N.S.W.) Lieut. Pompous,
of the Staff Corps, met an evening train
which was supposed to bring an expected
visitor, Major Joske. M.C., of Fiji, who was
holidaying in Sydney. There stepped from
a carriage a duly toothbrushed traveller, and
the lieutenant, seeking no further evidence of
identity, welcomed him on behalf of the Staff
Corps. The visitor seemed a little embar-
rassed, but courteously listened to the details
of the exercise as their car covered the short
distance to the officers’ mess. The new arri-
val was promptly taken to meet General
Bruche and his staff, but seeing that Major
Joske had already arrived by car in the
meantime, the introduction of Toothbrush
as the major merely bred a cold silence.
Toothbrush then took his cue and explained
that he was the typist detailed by D.11.Q.
to report in response to the General’s wire
of that day. If he appeared to take a little
malicious delight in his explanation, anyone
who knows the relations between the mili
tary and civil factors in the Defence Depart-
ment will understand.
“A.H.R.” : I know of no word with three
“e’s” following one another (B. _B/4/'26), but
in my capacity as a telegraphist I recently
came across one with three “s’s” similarly
placed, my first experience of such a thing
in 15 years. The message stated that the
sender was “unable to accept the mistress-
ship” of some school or other.
“H. J.” : “Country Ped” may find support
for his theory on heredity (B. l/4/’2G)
in the works of Professor Redfield, famous
in the U.S.A. for his research work in this
and kindred subjects. Redfield arrives at
the conclusion that early parentage prevents,
and delayed parentage encourages, the trans-
mission of acquired mental powers; he in-
stances many of the world’s greatest
as having been the children of parents
well advanced in years. The reverse
holds good in the physical sense; chil-
dren of young parents are more likely to
.excel in the athletic field. The child in-
herits. as a rule, the physical and mental
powers of its parents at the time of concep-
tion, and this also applies to the lower ani-
mals. According to the authority cited, if
racing mares were put to the stud _ at the
top of their form, instead of waiting till
their racing days are over, their progeny
would have a better chance of inheriting
Mu's fast habits, and the punters’ boot-soles
would last longer.
“Erua”: One of those unpleasant persons
who are addicted to announcing periodically
that they intend to commit suicide had a
chastening experience the other day. He is
a M.B. farmer who has long pestered a
totally-incredulous family with threats of an
early and spectacular end; this time he im-
parted to a dour Scotch neighbor that he had
finally selected the place and date. The Scot,
instead of trying to dissuade the intending
felo de stp, cheerfully volunteered to accom-
pany him, and was presently seated
on a river bank, with all the air of a dead-
head at a theatre, while the suicide, after
sundry delays and dissertations, waded into
the icy water. But when the performer’s
courage failed him, and he showed signs of
abandoning his purpose, it was too much for
the invited guest. Descending hurriedly,
he tried to pusli the infirm of purpose into
deep water, and had if not been, for the
appearance of a chance angler, it is highly
probable that he would have succeeded.. To
the subsequent remonstrances of the victim
and his rescuer, Sandy merely vouchsafed,
“Ay, but he said he wad do it, and I canna
waste a day for naething!”
* * * *
“Figure Merchant” : The man in the street
finds statistics not nearly so readable as
divorce reports, but here’s something that
may bu£k him up. The latest of them show
that the Australian has formed the habit
of living much longer than he used to. The
expectation of life at date of birth for males
was 47 years in 1890. In 1922 it had risen
to 59 years, a really remarkable advance.
The corresponding figures for females are 50
years in 1890 and 63 years in 1925. Another
thing that may please him to discover is that
whereas in 1890 only 10.4 p.c. of the males
born could count on reaching 80, in. 1922
18.6 p.c. were likely to get there, and in the
case of female children the chance is even
better.

“Pat Bushie”: So far as N. S. Wales, at
any rate, is concerned, “Buttinski” is talk-
ing through the headgear which he contends
a John Hop may and should wear when on
duty in a court of law (B. 8/4/’26). For
years I have been associated with courts of
many different grades in that State, and
never yet have I seen a cop who would dare
to keep his cap or hat on while either seated
or standing. A court of law creates rules
for the conduct of its own business, and to
disregard those rules is contempt and punish-
able as such, whether a policeman or a
civilian be the offender. The only citizen
who can keep his hat on is a Jew, and that
only while taking the oath. After that it
must be removed forthwith. Even the soldier
in court is bound by civil laws, like anyone
else.
* * * *
“Feng Shui” : A million Chinese make the
prosperity of the Foreign Settlement in
Shanghai, and time was when the idea of
giving them any control of tlieir destiuy was
unthinkable. At one period they .were not
even allowed to stay overnight inside its
borders. It required the shooting of a
number of Celestial rioters and the subse-
quent strike and boycott of British goods
to change the official attitude. Now a meet-
ing of ratepayers has almost unanimously
passed a resolution favoring the election of
three Chinese to the Council and the appoint-
ment of Chinese administrators of justice. It
is even proposed to admit the native popu-
lation to the parks. For many years it was
popularly believed that the public gardens
of Shanghai were guarded with the notice
“Dogs and Chinamen are not admitted.”
There was some justification for it, too. The
notice read, “No Chinese except servants in
attendance on foreigners are admitted” ; the
reference to dogs appeared four paragraphs
further down. The notice caused almost
as much bitter feeling as the belief that
missionaries were in the habit of kidnapping

“You're lucky. Mine can't but will.”
children for the purpose of making medicine
out of their eyes. A Chinese signwriter,
consciously or unconsciously, avenged his
nation’s honor, however. He was deputed
to add to the notice, “Drunken Persons Not
Admitted.” For some days afterwards the
ribald smiled at the legend “Drunken Parsons
Not Admitted.”
THE CURRICULUM OF LOVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“The University of Boston (U.S.A.) has insti-
Hlt J . Vacuity of love and Marriage. Female
students completing the course to the satisfaction of
the examiners are entitled to the degree of C.B.
(Certified Bride).”
They’ll doubtless teach the maiden wise
How best to use her sparkling eyes,
And, with a glance dashed through the dark
To speed unerring to the mark,
They’ll teach her, doubtless, how to say
Her lover “No” in such a way
That he’ll know well, in his distress,
A "No” is oft a masked "Yes.”
They’ll take a maiden free from guile
And teach her clearly how lo smile
Flirtatiously, yet innocent
Of what, might happen consequent.. *
They’ll lecture her on “Methods Sure
To Make a Wavering Love Secure,”
And all the other sundry arts,
To make her Bachelor of Hearts.
As for the men, they’ll teach them “Fine
Points of the Eternal Feminine” ;
They’ll show them how, when they would please,
All maidens work by contraries;
How, when they smile on other men
And turn from one, nine times in ten
That one they love; and do this thing
To tie him to their apron-string.
They’ll teach them signals of alarms,
Just when and where to “take to arms,”
And how an eye that’s turned away
Means “Come again some other day”;
How tears may be a sign of joy,
And frowns no more than a decoy ;
And, when great crises must be faced,
How best to utilise the waist.

Mark Sheldon, who is to be chairman of
directors of the new three-million-pound co.
which is to take over the Anthony Hordern
business, chose his father-in-law wisely: he
married a daughter of one of the Dalton
Brothers, and, having made good on various
rungs of that merchant firtn’s ladder, became
m due course its managirtg-director. While
las brother Stratford has ween making post-
mortems in Sydney—he lias carved up more
corpses than any other sturgeon in N. S.
At ales Mark was piling up the commercial
mid financial experience which a few years
ago led to his appointment as Australia’s
Commissioner in the U.S.A. Nowadays, be-
sides his connection with thfc Dalton busi-
ness, lie is the never-ruffled dhairmau of the
Australian Bank of Commerce and half a
dozen or so other concerns of importance.
The family came from Shaldspeare’s coun-
try; the two brothers were born in Armi-
dale, and came on to Sydney Uni. when
they were old enough.
Sam Hordern personally handled the
family s big money-making machine for some
years, but in 1917 he recalled Justly Raw-
lings from London to take the wheel. His
personal interest in the £3,500,000 company
which is now selling out is a mere 67,389
shares, but there is, besides, his interest in
the Samuel Hordern Trust, of which he is
chief executor and beneficiary, and wdiicli
holds 3,031,497 shares ; and he has massive
wealth in outside investments. Still the
present arrangements wouldn’t be changed if
some others of the family wmnted money as
little as he does. _He is keen, though,
on doing more for his country; for instance,
it ( certainly wasn’t for the miserable little
£6OO a year that he accepted a seat on the
Board of the Commonwealth Bank last year.
Of the original Federal Ministry led by
Edmund Barton, the only survivor is the
Speck’s former Premier Elliott Lewis, who
was a member of the Cabinet without port-
folio, but never sat in the Commonwealth
Parliament.
Regret will be felt at the passing of the
broadminded Rev. A. T. Chodowski, who
“rabbied” in Christchurch (where he made
his first appearance in Australasia), Bris-
bane, Dunedin, Melbourne and Sydney—the
Newtown synagogue w T as built under his
supervision—and w T ho a few years ago estab-
lished the Australian Jewish Chronicle,
In M.L. lie was a factor in public affairs.
Having helped considerably the agitation for
female suffrage, he led a procession of 200
women to the polls at Christchurch to record
their first vote; his advocacy led to the
supercession of private butcheries by muni-
cipal abattoirs; he had a hand in the first
shipment of frozen meat from M.L., and it
was after he had told Seddon about the pro-
vision made in ancient Hebrew law for the
aged that ‘'King Dick” decided to introduce
old-age pensions. The son of a dis-
tinguished Polish
Rabbi, be was,
with the exception
of Rabbi Dr. Abra-
ham s, of Ml el-
- the fore-
most Talmudist in
Australia, could
speak and write in
half a dozen lan-
guages, and was a
chessplayer of the
first class. His
habit of respond-
ing to every appeal
for help kept him
poor, and if he had
not himself the
means of helping
he generally knew
where to find it.
Once a cadger
bailed him up and
drained his pocket
of silver, Chodow-
ski keeping merely
enough, after list-
ening to a piteous
story, for his fare
home. “T hank
you. sir'; I could
see you were a
■Christian,” said
the cadger.

One of the victims of the Exeter (N.S.W.)
railway smash of 12 years ago was a seven-
year-old boy, who had to have both his arms
amputated below the elbow. His name was
Clyde Redshaw. and it was the same Clyde
Redshaw who the other day marched up to
the headmaster’s desk at Fort-street High
School to receive his leaving-certificate—he
had passed with three B’s and one A. As a
special concession he was allowed to use a
pencil instead of a pen at his examination
work. He cannot wear artificial arms owing
to the pain they cause, but he has learnt to
hold a pencil between the stumps of his
forearms.
The disappearance of Fred McDonald
created the political sensation of last week.
He simply vanished, and when a law case in
which he was a party was called on Thurs-
day he was still missing. McDonald, who
was beaten by Ley at the last Federal elec-
tion, had won the Barton seat in 1922
largely on his popularity amongst the scholars
at the Hurstville public school, where he was
a teacher. The unanimity with which the
school-kids did their bit for him was remark-
able. He lacked personal contact with these
useful election agents at the last political
affray, and, anyway, lie had not learnt that
the beginning of political wisdom lies in
nursing an electorate.
After a strenuous Easter campaign in Wel-
lington (M.L.) that would have laid up
many of his juniors. Archbishop Francis
Redwood, of the Marist Society, is on his
way to equally big efforts in S.A. and West-
ralia. On April 8 lie celebrated his 87th
birthday, and it is 52 years since he became
Bishop of Wellington. All his earliest con-
temporaries have departed, leaving him the
longest-term bishop in Christendom. He is
still erect and active, with more gold than
silver in his luxuriant beard. Later on
this year he will attend the Eucharistic Con-
gress in Chicago and bring back points for
the Sydney session in 1928.
Historic St. Francis’s, Melbourne, has lost
its Archpriest W. J. Quilter. The status he
held in the church was attested by the pre-
sence of more than 100 members of the
clergy at the requiem. Archpriest Quilter
took a special interest in children handi-
capped in life by lack of parental care,
and when he was given a feast-gift of £5OO
he transferred it to the foundling hospital at
Broadmeadows. In him that home loses its
staunchest champion.
Colin MacKenzie, the Scotch-Australian
professor who has caused a sensation by
claiming that a skull discovered at Cohuna
(Vic.) is ancient and non-aboriginal, is a big,
ginger-haired bundle of energy who worked
with Sir Arthur Keith at the Royal College
of Surgeons, and did great war service re-
educating maimed Diggers’ muscles. His re-
searches into infantile paralysis are in an
Oxford text-book, and he re-edited the famous
“Anatomy” of Sir Frederick Treves. A re-
search college is being built for him at Can-
berra, and he has a farm for breeding curious
fauna at Healesville (Vic.). Some time ago
he made the blinding discovery of a new
gland in the neck of the platypus. Not of
much moment in the layman’s eyes, but he
rushed off to England, stayed a fortnight,
and rushed back, having upset London’s pre-
conceived ideas upon a recondite subject. In
anthropological circles he has a world-wide
reputation, and he is a fanatic on the sub-
ject of Australian football.
A notable Bananalander, H. G. Livesay, the
discoverer of the Chillagoe caves, has passed
out at Cairns. When William Macgregor was
Governor of New Guinea Livesay was com-
mandant of police at Moresby, and the
Queensland Museum houses many tine speci-
mens of natural history and geology given
by him during that period. Though he was
64 when the Boer War broke out, the Third
Queensland Contingent secured him as a pri-
vate —the oldest man to serv« in the war. He
was at Ladysmith and Spion Kop, and re-
turned to Queensland severely wounded; but
the northern climate let him live till 90.
Whitmore Carr has been re-elected presi-
dent of the Stock Exchange of Adelaide for
the 23rd year, and Walter Gurner its vice-
president for the eighth time. Carr was, be-
fore lie took to share-dealing during the Ival-
goorlie boom, sporting editor of Adelaide
Register.
Death has claimed another of the a’Beck-
etts —this time Dr. W. G., of St. Kilda —a
son of the former Anglican diocesan regis-
trar and brother of the late senior Judge of
Vic. Supreme Court. Born in London in
the year Queen Vic. came to the throne. Dr.
a'Beckett came to Melbourne in ’5l, and for
years w T as senior honorary surgeon at the
Children’s Hospital; his name was revered
in many struggling households.
A real South Aus. pioneer was R. S.
Townsend, lately dead at 94. He remem-
bered clearing stumps out of Hindley-street
at a time when most of w T hat is now Adel-
aide was scrub. As a small boy he lived for
several weeks in a native camp just outside
the city; then he was billposter for his uncle
Deering in Adelaide’s first theatre, and later
a comic singer on its boards. He was no
longer young when he became a miller at
Mount Torrens; but he put in half a cen-
tury there.
Anzac Day has dug out another almost
incredibly ancient Digger. Harry Brown,
who is a verger at St. Paul’s, Melbourne,
has a birth-certificate to show that he is
78 years old, which means that he was 69
when he enlisted in 1917. The call w T as for
men, and, as younger men were not offering
quickly enough, he said he was 44, and
passed through. He finished as a corporal.
Alfred Settree w T as a man of consequence
in Sydney shipbuilding when the launching
of wooden craft for the coastal trade kept
business brisk. He was born in Sydney 81
years ago, and built many stout vessels of
good Australian timber, but ultimately gave
up shipbuilding and went into the sawmill
trade. He had filled out 20 years of retire-
ment with an enthusiasm for bowls before
his clubs, at Gladstone Park and Drum-
moyne, half-masted their flags for him.
The new Bish of Christchurch (M.L.),
Campbell West-Watson, has been duly en-
throned in the city wdiicli gives name to his
extensive see. The dear old gentlemen of the
Synod were much vexed over the choice of
a successor to Archgaiters Julius, and, un-
able to reach any agreement, referred the
whole question to Randall Cantab. So the
new man starts bishing with the highest
recommendations. On the first night in his
new home he was presented with an
ultimatum by a hot-and-bothered canvasser
to the effect that if a pink form was not filled
II L forthwith the electric light would be cut
ott, which means that the new bishop is
enjoying the full rights of citizenship in the
serious little flat city from the word “go.”
A sturdy Scot is A. (“Sandy”) Lamont,
born 100 years ago, who, coming to Victoria,
settled near Lancefield. The other day the
local meenister, on behalf of the ladies of
the kirk, presented-the centenarian with a
birthday-cake bedecked with 100 candles.
“Ma conscience!”
exclaimed the grati-
fied recipient, “I’ll

Another little lot of Vic. railway officers
will leave for Yankeeland shortly. The 34-
year-old Vic. Letcher, who is already special
officer to the Commissioners (after 16 years’
service), member of the committee inquir-
ing into metropolitan rail facilities and
Clapp’s representative on the ’Bus Advisory
Board, will lead the delegation. The other
two are M. J. Brennan and the poetic James
McClelland. Brennan, who is 54 and has
been on the job 39 years, is chief of a new
division which keeps a staff of 75 employed
on the tabulating and calculation of all rail-
way statistics. McClelland, whose verse has
appeared in The Bulletin, is 44 and the
Department’s fares expert.
“Coppertop”: Although the cableman
didn’t mention it, many an Australian Dig-
ger had reason to be grateful to Bayard
Brown the eccentric American millionaire
who recently died aboard his yacht, the Vel-
freyia, which had been lying off the English
coast for 35 years. During the war years
the yacht was anchored in the river iColn,
some miles from its mouth, near Wivenhoe.
All engineers of the A.I.F. who passed
through Brightlingsea Camp, Essex, could
see it clearly from the train on their w T ay
to Colchester, the Diggers’ week-end ren-
dezvous. Hundreds of Australians in local
hospitals were indebted for small comforts
to a fund provided by a benefactor who pre-
ferred not to have his identity disclosed. It
was Bayard Brown.
Old Macananly, a Mqrram (Vic.) cocky,
took with him to the grave lately a caustic
wit that was the joy of the district. It’s
just a little while since he met another
old cow-farmer at the graveside of a mutual
friend and astonished his crony by remark-
ing after the ceremony, “Well, d’ye think it’s
worth while our going home, Bill?”
Still active about Bundaberg (Q.), though
now nearly blind, is a veteran nearing 80
with a Santa Claus beard and a fund of
reminiscence. He is William Howard, tin*
discoverer of the coalfield whose central
township bears his name, and the first
settler in the district which accounted for
the foundation of Bundaberg, now 12,000
people strong. Howard was pioneer of the
Isis country, a great sweep of red-soil which
is now dotted with townships and closely
settled with cane-farms.
Methodist union in Australia has existed
for 24 years. Before that there was division
amongst the Methodists and no Federal con-
trol. Four men who toured the continent in
the interests of unity did much to wear down
the hostility, and of these Dr. W. H.
(“Bleeds”) Fitchett alone remains. Samuel
Way, the S.A. Chief Justice, and Dr. Bur-
gess (S.A.) died years ago; and Thomas
Copeland has now heard the call. Born 81
years ago, Copeland was a boy-preacher, and
started his work in Australia as a mission-
ary to the Fiery Creek diggings at Ballarat.
He was for 10 years editor of the sect’s
paper.
Fred Davison, R.SX. representative on
the German Verge Returned Soldiers’ Trust
(Sydney), whose spectacular resignation—
it was subsequently withdrawn—drew atten-
tion to the delay in dealing with cases of
soldiers and soldiers’ dependants in distress,
managed to get past the recruiting-officer
when he was 49; ajnd he did his bit in
France as well as tine best of the juveniles
of the First Battalion. When the war came
he was in America, where his attempt to raise
an American-Australian Corps was stopped
by. the U.S. Government. A majority of the
exiled Australians wjho bad rallied to his call
crossed the border and enlisted in the Cana-
dian forces. Davisfon stayed in the States
until he had grown, sick of carrying on pro-
paganda to brinjg them into the war.
Then he came to Australia and enlisted. He
has been a leading} spirit in the R.S.L. ever
since his return.
GLAD TIDINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The King and Queen were awakened between three
and four o’clock on Tuesday morning, and told
of the birth of their first grand-daughter.”
They woke a King—not as in olden days
To tell him that the foe was at the gate
And bid him buckle on his armor straight ;
No stimulating news of hard-fought frays
And rival monarclis squelched was theirs to bring ;
Yet, ere the early-morning April haze
Was off the Thames and the mild winds of spring
Arose the Windsor oaks to agitate,
The varlets at his door were hammering
To wake a King.
They woke a Queen —p’r’aps not from beauty sleep
Precisely, for the clock had stricken three;
Withal a trifle early, you’ll agree,
For even Queens from Blanketland to leap.
Had it been Bess—but no, that couldn’t have been—■
She might have made them feel a trifle cheap
For breaking her somniferous routine.
Nor was it with a cup of morning tea,
Or news that you could class as unforeseen,
They woke a Queen.
They woke a pair, the highest in the land—
Whether apart or side by side they lay
Is immaterial, and it doesn’t say.
The point is courtiers feared no reprimand
Such as an ordinary dad might fling
From Dreamland dragged to learn the prefix “Grand-”
Was his henceforward for the uttering.
These twain were royal, and when the dawn was
grey
They woke, to tell them this auspicious thing,
A Queen and King.

“Anaf”: Can anybody identify two ani-
mals, possibly- belonging to different varieties of the
same species, which were captured recently by some
trappers in the country around Wilson’s Peak, near
Killarney, On the Queensland-N.S.W. border? The
creatures were small and sturdily-built, about 3Aft.
long from the tip of the nose to the extreme point
of the tail, the latter—which was bushy'—-being about
18in. in length; the legs were 12in. long and about
Sin. in circumference. In color they were a dark
chocolate-brown, with creamy-colored spots about the
size of a shilling. Their heads, which were equipped
with stiff, bristling whiskers, were long, narrow
and pointed, like those of rats, the ears also re-
sembling- those of a rodent. The peculiar creatures
carried their bodies close to the ground, with a
slinking movement, and their paws seemed to be
fitted for burrowing. The cry' they' uttered was not
unlike that of a fox, but rose to a high and plaintive
wail. Residents of the district have been quite
unable to classify the animals, nothing like them
having been seen in those parts before.

“Strict Veg.”: The mushroom season has
arrived, and already a party of Melbourne motorists
has boasted that it returned from a day’s excursion
to the country with a load that realised £25. There
is another side to the triumph, however. A few
years ago the Vic. Railway Department advertised
special trains for mushroom-gatherers, but protests
from the surrounding cockies made it change its
mind. Most of the fungi come from private lands.
The farmer surely has as much right to this natural
catch-crop as the suburbanite has to the lettuces in
his back yard.
* * * *
“Mug Gunner”: I agree with “Cuchulain”
(B. 18/3/’26) that my-a 11 is an excellent cabinet-
making wood, and that its foliage is good sheep-
fodder, but to recommend it as firewood proves he
has never used it in a stove. The fact is, burning
myall throws off a heat so great that only' firebricks
could resist it; a stove would soon turn pale, lose
its shape and tumble to pieces. Out in the open,
however, myall is the king of billy-boilers. It makes
no charcoal and burns to an ash as light and white
as cornflour.

"Lao-dah” : Dr. Cilento, the director of
the Commonwealth Institute of Tropical Medicine,
with over 30 years’ experience, says that Northern
Queensland’s troubles are largely due to unsuitable
clothing. The man who wears close-fitting garments,
whether he lives in Townsville or Melbourne, i-
always in the tropics, because the layer of stagnant
air he carries round inside his suit is heated by
the body to 98.4 deg. F., with maximum humidity. I
always find that the
native dress, whatever
it happens to be, is
founded on sound
science, like th c
Papuan habit of guard-
ing against too much
moisture in the body
by filling the mouth
with water and then
spitting it out. A
cotton singlet and a
cotton sarong twisted
round the waist and
dropping to the ankles
is the universal house-
wear for white men in
Malaya. Unfortunately,
when they go out, they
don the starched drill-
suit or the black even-
ing-dress of “ ‘olio’ cus-
tom.” In Java Dutch
women ascribe much of
their good health to
their habit of wearing
the native sarong and
kabaya. The English
woman rigs herself out
in European dress, and
tells her husband she
needs a trip home even'
second year. Nudity',
plus an umbrella, would
probably be the ideal
array, and the Chinese
rickshaw coolie in
Singapore, who drags
entire Malay families
round at a jog-trot all
day long without get-
ting in a perspiration,
comes as near to it as
any with his short blue
drawers and sun-hat.

to the tropics. It remains only for the white man to
struggle against reason and necessity, and go proudly
to his grave clad in a serge suit and a stiff boiled
shirt.

“Nitram”: “Jora Jora” (B. 25/3/’26)
thinks there is more luck than judgment in guess-
ing the weight of a bullock. Here’s an instance of
both ways coming out a dead-heat. About 20 years
ago at one of the good old sports days we used
to have at Mount Morgan (Q.) guessing the dressed
weight of a live bullock was one of the attractions.
In this instance the beast was one ol a mob a local
butcher was putting through, and his book-keeper
told me they died about 50ib. better than thev
looked. 1 was working for the rival cow-killer, who
had often proved his skill as a judge of “beef on
the hoof.” Returning from the sports, he told us
wliat his guess was. I added the 501 b., and “landed” ;
but so did another man —a miner, who just knew a
bullock from a horse. I naturally asked him how he
got there. He explained that it was the number
of his brass-ticket, which the co. used to issue to
THE QUICK THINKER.
“Mary, it’s seven o'clock and per father's not ’ome. For better
'op round to the police-station with his tea.”
its permanent hands in those days. It became known
that I hadn’t seen the bullock, and I was accused
of being- lucky, but I always considered that my
guess was based on sound judgment. The prize was
a thousand-gal. tank. My brass-ticket partner, being
a single man, sold out to me for 30s.

“Bughunter” : Tlie Vic. Government ento
mologist receives some queer “insects” to identify.
One evening recently his dinner was disturbed by an
agitated lady pulling at his doorbell. Inside the
cardboard-box she produced there was, she said,
a live worm which she had found on the front lawn.
“It has grown feet during the day,” she assured
the Government man. A peep into the box in the
semi-dusk did not clear up the mystery, but under
the electric light the inside of a golf-ball was
revealed. The heat of the day had caused a strip of
rubber, which had become detached, to 'further un-
wind ; hence the growth of the “worm.”
* * * *
“Verri”: Among the trees and shrubs of
the Maoriland bush is a small shrub that grows well
near the sea and bears an orange-colored berry.
This is used by the Maoris, and many whites also, as
a stimulant, and its bucking-up properties are cer-
tainly marvellous. Not long ago a woman who had
a strenuous day before her and felt utterly unfit
to face it was induced by her half-caste maid to
try the remedy; she remarked later that after taking
it she felt fit to carry on at top speed for a week.
The same family had a sick cow which was lying in
a moribund condition. As a last resort a farm-hand
shot a scoopful of the berries down the cow’s throat,
and an hour later the astounded family met the
animal strolling round. An old man facing a long
trek across Waiheke Island to visit relatives took
a supply with him to help the journey out, and
reported later that he didn’t even feel tired.
* * * #
“Larrapinta” (N.T.) : Bushdwellers who
“prepare” honey in the way mentioned by “Goolabah”
(B. 25/2/’26) deserve a far heartier cursing than
he gave them, as they are often responsible for
spreading “foul-brood,” a disease which is as great
a calamity to a beekeeper as rinderpest is to the
stockraiser. A bushman finds a swarm in a hollow
tree, cuts the latter open, and carries the combs
home, leaving some pieces behind. If a. man who
makes his livelihood froom bees has hives, which
may number from 150 to 500, within three miles of
the spot, his bees will assuredly find the tree, and
rob the swarm of the little honey left. If the wild
swarm should happen to have foul-brood, the infec-
tion will be carried by the domesticated bees back to
their hives, and the beekeeper has often to destroy
bees and plant together worth a hundred pounds, be-
fore lie can stamp out the disease. Twice in the
last six years I have discovered foul-brood in my
apiary, and in each case I traced the outbreak to
this cause.
“Der Jong”: “Coconut” (B. 8/4/'26)
blames,the Papuan white women for allowing native
houseboys to see them in scanty raiment, and gives
this practice as a reason for the unpleasant change
in the darky’s attitude towards white women.
Ho is, no doubt, right there, as he is wrong in refer-
ring to this laxness as a South African custom or
habit. No white woman in South Africa, in my
experience, would take
such a risk, at any' rate
among the Butu warrior
tribes, of which the
Zulu is the highest
embodiment. YV h e n
’Tchoka organised the
Zulus into the most per-
fect military organisa-
tion in savage history,
he made chastity for
man and woman the
foundation of his
scheme. No man could
marry among his own
people till he was a
ringed man, and had
seen active service for
a stated time. The
Zulu girl had to remain
chaste until duly given
in matrimony. The
punishment for
offenders was the same
for both sexes. They
were pegged out on
antbeds. The result
was that the Zulu girl
remains a synonym for
chastity in South Africa
to-day. Her brother
does not, since the law
does not debar him
from alien women, and
his freedom to deal with
these as he liked was
one of his great incen-
tives to battle T h «
Basutos and Swazis, off-
shoots of the Amazulu,
maintained this law,
and the story of white
settlement along their
borders and those of
Zululand is a catalogue
of horrors where white
women are concerned.
The danger of the old
raids is gone, but the
individual Kaffir re-
mains always an un-
pleasant possibility.
He is thus quite differ-
cut from the South Sea native accustomed to
early sex promiscuity, and neither maid nor matron
takes any chances where he is concerned,

‘‘Tratnpas”: Peafowl in large numbers
were a year or so ago to be discovered feeding in thick
scrub at the bottoms of some of the more inaccessible
valleys of Rottnest Island (W.A.). As they were
extraordinarily wary and few people ever came across
them, I suppose they are still there. An islander
who has been stationed by the Fremantle Harbor
Trust at Rottnest for a quarter of a century told me
that flocks were sometimes to be seen a hundred

strong. Detecting slight scepticism on my part, he
dragged me through a mile of detestable scrub to
the floor of a narrow valley where abundant evidence
of the recent presence of peafowl was disclosed in the
shape of discarded feathers from the tails of the
rocks. Of a live bird, not a sign!

THE SONG OF THE GRAPE-PICKER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the land is tired of summer, with March and
April here,
In what poets call “the mellow, leafy falling of
the year,”
When the vines are at their greenest, and the grapes
are hanging low,
A purple harvest waiting in every laden row,
Then it’s down on your knees, set the knife a-flashing
through;
There’s many a bucket idle yet, a hundred more to
do;
The cellars all gape empty, the old vats thirst and
wait,
So pull the leaves away and pick—we’re on a paying
rate.
It’s out in the morning ere the dewy vines are dry
With the old sun a-winking from out a cloudless sky.
We cannot pull the grapes yet—the drays are here
to load,
The drivers waiting anxiously to be upon the road ;
They’ve many miles to do to-day before their journey
ends
’Way out to where the sluggish Murray drifts and
dreams and bends. .
So we hoist the gleaming buckets and ram the
bunches tight,
While the scent of welling grape-juice fills our
nostrils with delight.
The drays go creaking outward in flying clouds of
dust,
The horses pulling gamely as toiling bush-teams
must;
The sun is climbing upward, the hazes dip and flow,
The nipper gathers in the tins, and sets them row
and row;
GOOD PROSPECTS.
“Any chance of a job this mornin’, Boss?”
“I shouldn't be surprised. I sec there's a wan hasn't come. If
he isn't here inside half an hour I'll send him home and
give ye the job, I will.”
The full day's tally must be made, the time is fly-
ing fast;
The laziest man has settled down —he’s working hard
at last.
The buckets bang and rattle; the ringer gets away,
The novice picks his thirty and is finished for the
day.
So it’s down on your knees while the knife goes
flashing through.
There’s many a bucket idle yet, a hundred more to
do;
The purple stains the old vat’s mouth, and still he
gapes and waits ;
Each bunch we pick he thirsts the less —and these
are paying rates.

BRAND
P /§)
Fumigation with Cyanogas (Calcium Cyanide) is the modern
scientific method of wiping out the rabbit pest. It is safe, sure,
and speedy in action. Blown in the form of a fine dust into the
openings of the burrows, it gives off deadly fumes which destroy
every rabbit in the area.
Mr. G. C. Davis, Dampon, Scone, writes ‘2sth September, 1925:
‘■Re Calcium Cyanide Dust. We did great work last season with
it in thinning out the rabbits. Where they were very thick la#
season there is hardly a rabbit to be seen now.”
Mr. Geo. Langley, of River Farm, Albion Park,
writes 23/11/’25: “My experience with Flake
Calcium Cyanide is that it kills every rabbit
in the burrows, no matter how large the
burrows are. I have dug the rabbits out of
my farm (200 acres). I used the 61b. r
bought from j'ou in the largest burrows, and
after digging out the smaller ones I decided
to dig out the large ones, and in every instance
found the rabbits all dead. I got as many as
32 in one burrow. I can recommend it to
anyone who wants to get rid of rabbits.”

“Pick” : Re the value of cedar-trees (B.
25/3/’26). Near the northern bank of the Tweed
River (N.S.W. North Coast), a big cedar stands
upon a ledge half-way down the face of a 350 ft.
precipice. An offer of £3OO stands in the name of
a local timber merchant to anyone lowering the giant
to the cliff-foot below, or hauling him to the brow-
above, w-ithout damage to the trunk. Cedar has not
always been so prized. At Gerringong (N.S.W.) a
one-time livery-stable, now used as a motor-shed, is
constructed of 12 x 2 cedar-slabs 10ft. long.

frowsy specimen of the suburban tramp, and viewed
with evident distaste the proposal that he should
qualify himself for a meal. After 10 minutes’ wood-
chopping, lie again appeared at the kitchen door.
“Got it. finished so soon?” I inquired. “No,” he
said, wiping his perspiring brow, “but I thought
before doin’ any more I’d ask to look over yer bill-
of-fare.”
“Sir Nigel” : Dogs sometimes acquire queer
habits. An old collie belonging to a friend of mine
in a small Queensland town had a way of going to
sleep with his head on one of the rails of the local
railway line. Do what he could, his master failed
to teac ‘h him to cut it out. I was in the cabin
of an engine one day when suddenly the driver cried,
“Good Lord, we’ve run over poor old Ranger!” He’d
had his morning nap on the rail once too often,
“GOOD JOB I WAS ’ANDY, WASN'T IT, MISTER?”
“Fitz” : They grow some pretty tidy sticks
oh the Bulga Plateau, some 28 miles from Wingham,
N. S. Wales North Coast. One tallow-wood tree
recently operated on-at Elands was 60ft. in length
and as sound as the Rural Bank. It had a girth of
12ft. Bin., and boasted of 7218 super, feet log mea-
surement. This stick was cut into four 15ft. logs.
Another twig treated at the same mill was 83ft. long,
wan solid throughout, and had a girth of lift. Oin.
Its super, log-measurement totalled 8233 ft. This
sapling also was cut. into four logs.
“Bushie” : There is a common fallacy that
as men bred in the bush know all about trees and
their habits, we are the right people to be put in
charge of forests. 1
don’t believe it. The
bushman’s attitude to-
wards trees is mostly
not that of a friend
but of an enemy. Wc
may weep a few senti-
mental tears over a
magnificent - cedar as we
chop it down, for some-
thing the same reason
that the Malay says
soothing things to a
deer as lie cuts its
Uiroat, in order to pla-
cate its vengeful spirit.;
but our real interest
lies nearly always in
destruction and not in
preservation. It. is in the
nature of our struggle
with Nature that we
should want to see the
bush removed. All our
knowledge goes for
nothing when a new
pest comes into the
field, and our braw-n
and muscle can be van-
quished by an insect
we are unable to see.
The scientist takes long
views which may be-
come of incalculable
value to posterity. His
seemingly feckless re-
searches in a laboratory
tniles from the scene
of battle may- be the
means of saving mil-
lions of pounds of
timber. Vic. Minister
for Lands Downward
told a deputation that
asked for the appoint-
ment of scientific foresters the other day that
bushmen would do him. Yes, bushmen certainly-;
but scientific buslnnep.
* * * *
“F.H.”: Reference lias been made to the
importation of cochineal beetles for the destruction
of prickly-pear, and it has been asserted that these
insects will not attack fruit-trees or become a
national pest. As a set-off to such assertions, the
following is an extract from an American work,
“Henly’s Twentieth-century Book of Receipts, For-
mulas and Processes.” On page 422 it is stated:
“For cochineal insects: An emulsion for fumagine
(malady of orange-trees caused by the cochineal
insect) and other diseases caused by insects.” Then
follow the directions and proportions of the
emulsion. Apparently, then, this importation j does
not confine itself to a prickly-pear diet.
“Jimpey”: Has “Vie Emma” tried au
arsenic spray for that patch of Johnson grass in his
cultivation paddock (B. 4/'3/’26)? This, if applied
to the stubble with thoroughness directly after the
grass has been barbered, should do the removing
trick. If the poison doesn’t shift the patch “Vic’s”
only hope is a withering- drought.
“Rambler”: Only perseverance will beat Johnson
grass. Try fencing in the area and using it as a
pig-yard. Stocking it with plenty of pigs will beat
it, as they root out and eat the succulent shoots.
We had .an area on the Darling Downs. I dug it
deep, the full depth of the fork, and picked
out all roots visible. Then as the plants showed
above ground I pulled and ran the shoots, then
worked over the land with a duck hoe as deep as
possible. This I kept up as long as a plant showed,
and it was not long before the whole area was
free of the curse. The secret of success is to keep
the plants from getting light or air. Spring- is
the best time to tackle the work.
* * * *
“Namoi”: Nigger, at one time boss
of the yard, had become a canine old-age pensioner,
toothless, stiff in the joints, almost blind. We let
him live, since none had the heart to put the old
fellow to death. Then Ring, an eager, feathery-tailed
nondescript youngster, was added to our horde of
mongs. From the first he constituted himself the old
dog’s guardian. As soon as’the scraps were thrown out
Ring- used to charge in, 'back out with a bone, tear
off and deposit it -at Nigger’s ,‘fedt, "and then fly back
for his own share. The wife saw to it that there
always remained a titbit for the little gentleman
sans pedigree.
“Wandi”: A cunning o'ld bloke on the
Richmond (X.S. \V'.) used to catch mullet with hook
and line when other people could get them only with
a net. At last it was discovered that he baited With
the ripe fruit of the Moreton Bay'fig-tree. Mullet
are fond of the figs, and ho fished where the trees
grew near the water. Bushels of fruit were knocked
off by pigeons and other birds, and the popping on
the water attracted any mullet that happened to be
cruising in the neighborhood. The Richmond is one
of the most favored spawning-places of sea-mullet.
Sometimes a sudden flood catches them when they are
high up, with the result that their gills get clogged
with mud, and tons of dead fish float hack to
the sea.
“A.McD.”: Recently two aboriginals—a
rare sight in Melbourne—found their way into the
Picture Gallery. They stood in front of the well-
known painting “Anguish,” wherein a ewe with a
dedd lamb at her feet is surrounded by ravenous ctow-s
ready to feast upon the dead. Coming from far back,
where the crow and his ways are well known, the
realism of the painting keenly aroused the ire of
the blackfellows. One, evidently- more moved than
his companion, tapped the other on the shoulder and
said: “By cripes, 1 wish I bin there. I’d gib those
plurry crows somet’ing.” It’s the first bit of art-
criticism I’ve ever heard of from Black Brother.
* . * * * <
“Jimmy Possum”: “Outsizes in trees?” said
old George the blower, as we were yarning after tea
one evening. “Well, I seed one that high wunst —I
forget jus’ where it were—that it took yer two hours
ter see ter th’ top uv it. But th’ whopperest wus
a grandfather croV-ash growin’ in a patch uv jungle
high up on th’ Bananaland coast. It wus that thick
it pushed th’ scrub back two chains tryin’ ter make
room for itself. An’ th’ top—well, if it wus growin’
in th’ open half uv Kidman’s cattle could ha’ got
in th’ shade uv it. It got that heavy .at last that
th' ground caved in under it, leavin’ a hole that big
that three chains uv scrub all round fell in an’ went
clean out uv sight. Th’ las’ time I seed it th’ hole
was three parts full uv water an’ jus’ lousey with
ducks an’ pelicans.”
* * * *
“Werrimee”: The brolga was probably
Australia’s first protected bird, being held sacred by
Black Brother. The Castlereagh tribe had a legend
that long ago there was a beautiful girl named
Brolga, who was far-famed for her dancing. She was
kidnapped by two giants, whose incantations changed
her into a great crane. In that -form she returned
to dance before the camps, and was recognised by
certain steps that no one but she had danced. By
and bye, on the plains, the one bird became many,
and for ever afterwards they were known as brolgas.
“Mungina”: “M.G.” is wrong when he say s that
the brolgas dance only at sunrise. I have seen them
in western N. S. Wales dancing as late as ten o’clock
in the morning.
* ■* * #
“Don”: Touching the distance the human
voice will'carry (B. 18/3/’26), my experience is
that it goes furthest on frosty nights or during the
very early hours of a frosty morning. Where I am,
in the Avon district of W.A., I have heard a neigh-
bor calling his cows (never mind what) over a mile
away, and axes “going” on different farms at the
same distance. When the railway was being built
one could hear blasting over 20 miles away, but
only on frosty mornings. In the early pioneering
days of this district a brother-in-law of mine was
singing one night something about “home and
mother.” The next day a neighbor, whose camp was
two miles off, paid him a visit. “Did you hear the
dingoes last night?” he asked. They compared
times, and the dingoes were exculpated.
“Two Seas” : That story of the small frog
that jumped down the navvy's throat (B. l/4/’26)
uncaps a cell in my memory. At the boarding-
school I attended when a youngster in England was
a consumptive-looking- usher who used to ask me
to bring him any tiny frogs I caught at the swim-
ming-pool. It puzzled me what he did with them until
one day I was amazed to see him swallow one. An
older boy told me that the natives of that county
believed that to swallow a small frog alive
helped in some mysterious manner to cure consump-
tion. He was quite serious, and seemed to think
there was some truth in it. Has anyone on the
Council ever heard of such a “cure” ?
* * * *
“Gouger”: Ten thousand or more years
ago Binghi’s ancestors thought out intricate tribal
laws relating- to marriage, to relationship, to the
food-supply, to religion, to birth-control, to war, even
(among island tribes) to navigation. All was buih
on the surivival of the fittest as necessitated by
environment, and, as was absolutely necessary, all
laws hinged on “a tooth for a tooth.” The thinking-
out and memorising of every detail proves thai
Binghi’s ancestors possessed a mentality of a high
degree, however curious it seems to our eyes. Thou-
sands of years ago Binghi’s spiritualism was esssn
HE NEVER MISSED IT.
BARKBLOKK: “Yairs, I'm sorry I sold that
lirrel daug—I am really. I dicin' know
I’d miss ’ini so much!”
BLOKKRAKK (who has got the worst of the
bargain): “By cripes, I never miss the
cow! I just let ’im 'are ’it wir the
boot.”
Dally the same as that known amongst us learned
peoples to-day. His mythology agrees remarkably
with our Bilile, even to a well-authenticated Flood
and Ark. He implicitly believes in the “Great
Spirit” who. made all, in reincarnation, and in long-
ages to come a final heaven far up beyond the Milky
Way.
RECALLED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They sought the peace of the fairer fields where the
orchard blooms and the cornstalk yields
In a laughing land of rolling streams which the
carefree heart rejoices.
They crossed the sands of the wilted plain that craved
for the healing balm of rain,
While mirages mocked at hopeless dreams and the
lean sheep's pleading voices.
They rode for the range that rose between their shim-
mering waste and the planted green
Where bright birds squander their dulcet tones to
blend with the fragrant zephyrs;
They rode from famine and scourging drouth with
yearning ey-es on the verdant South,
From blight of the bleaching, scattered bones and
the starving steers and heifers.
They trekked long days o’er the lifeless loam, the
hot wind urging them far from home,
The slow- hoofs timing their grim retreat and the
purple summits calling.
They turned at times for a space to gaze with dumb
regrets through the woeful liaze
That hung like a pall on burning- wheat, when
tlie molten sun was falling.
The wind from tbe South w-as soft as fleece, and the
sun smiled fair on a day of peace
Beyond the heights where the tall trees sing as
they shake their gleaming- tresses.
Their hot eyes fell on the downs of gold that into
the dreaming distance rolled
While a magpie choir w-as carolling to banish their
dire distresses.
One glance behind for the last—-but lo! a column of
sombre cloud crept slow
From the far horizon brown and bare whence a cool
north wind w-as springing.
They loitered then on the timbered crest while a
scud closed in from the east and w-est;
They drank deep draughts of the mountain air,
and the kingly trees were singing.
They felt the balm of the healing rain and w-atched
it flooding the wilted plain
They had crossed for the shining waterways, on a
trail by song forsaken.
Then home they turned from the planted South to a
land redeemed from the scourge of drouth;
To toil for the yield of fruitful day-s that shower
and sunshine waken.

REDUCE OVERHEAD COSTS!
At no stage in the history of this country
has it been so imperative that costs
should come down. Efficiency in every
branch of industry is called for.
Material, effort, power must all render
their utmost. In this connection
DUNLOP
BELTING
SERVICE - CONVEYOR- DRIVING
offers manufacturers, mining, and
other primary industries the opportun-
ity of obtaining the highest efficiency
and economy in transmission of power;
also in the transport of every descrip-
tion of material —from ore to grain—
at a charge infinitesimal to the cost of
the out-of-date methods employed in
many industries. We have the finest
and largest plant in the Southern
Hemisphere for the manufacture of
every description of high class rubber
belting, thousands of miles of which is
already rendering fine service in the
industrial progress of this country.
Dunlop belting has won a unique repu-
tation in the Common wealth for quality,
value and service, and has demonstrated
its superiority over the imported article.
Our experience is at your service,

STOCKINGS
The week-end found Australia with bowed
head for the passing of her 70,000 Anzacs.
In Sydney Chopin’s “Funeral March” and
“The Last Post” surged around a sunwashed
city like the waves of some unplumbed sea
of sorrow. Out at the Memorial in Anzac-
avenue an army of fathers was gathered,
the eyes of many still bewildered from the
sight of that suddenly emptied world they
had gazed at 11 years ago. The Woolloomoo-
loo gates drew the mothers and widows of
the leaf-brown soldiers who had never re-
turned. In almost every church army-
padres assisted at the service of remembrance
-—no less than five soldier-priests celebrated
the Requiem at St. Mary’s. Out to the
gates of the Town Hall surged the overflow
congregation at the civic service; and every-
where Diggers in the now seldom-worn khaki
walked lonely for the cobbers they had lost.
Sydney walked with learning last week
till it arrived with a flourish at the gradua-
tion ceremonies at the Uni. Marked trees on
the path blazoned (a) the discovery of a
skull that is claimed to be the first brain-box
of the human race, (b) W. Sliakspeare’s
birthday, (c) the turning of Priminister
Bruce into a Doctor of Laws. Item c was
the star event of the cap-and-gown parade
in the Great Hall. Mr. Bruce, putting up
a by no means contemptible imitation of Car-
dinal Wolsey in his scarlet robes, success-
fully interpreted the mystic signs put before
him by Chancellor William Cullen, and
passed out into the world an LL.D. of Syd-
ney. But you mustn’t think that Mr. Bruce
had all the trimmings. A knutty design in
floating white sleeves was flung on the screen
by Knight of the Midnight Oil Mungo Mac-
C-allum; a touch of ermine enhanced the
roses in the cheeks of Judge Backhouse; the
Viking aired his Admiral’s cap, and an air-
man’s coat with the fashionable godet in its
skirt accentuated the waistline of Aide Max
Coote. The business of handing out the
scrip was completed by an experienced Chan-
cellor in an hour and a half. There was a
cheery, cash-and-carry air about the giving
and taking' which indicated that the young
can flirt with Homer and Cicero, anatomy
and pathology and still escape the bearing of
a Portia or a Lady Macbeth. Elaine Shorter,
incidentally, coupled her law degree with
the Rose Scott prize. Addie Walker was
the only girl to get honors in medicine. As
for Hazel Claire Weekes, she bearded the
lion in his den, so to speak, and has the
honor of being the first girl student to carry
off the University medal for Zoology.
If any ghostly Sliakspeare company walked
the Sydney boards in honor of the Bard’s
birthnight, they must have done it in the
nude, or in those suits of vapor that are gen-
erally supposed to be their common wear. For
the J. C. AVilliamson wardrobes had been
cleaned to the bone of their Shakspearean
costumes by ardent English-speaking Union-
ists, and the pegs of the Hook and Eye
were reported by special-courier Puck to
have been emptied by the same enthusiasts.
The moment having arrived, the costumes
performed their masque at the Ambassa-
dors, where good Queen Bess held court,
contenting herself with a playful shake of
her jewelled red head at papa when he
arrived with all six of his wives. Shaks-
peare didn’t come, but Francis Jackson was
there, and he is Shakspeare’s special repre-
sentative in Sydney. He and Nellie Stewart,
with Theo Cowan (a sweet Ann Hathaway
with Tudor roses clipping her upstanding
ruff of old English lace), awarded the prizes
for the most effective costumes and sets.
Seated on a throne-like chair, Queen Eliza-
beth (Mrs. Philip Roseby) received the
allegiance of nobles and ladies, the grand
and the simple, from all climes and times,
her subjects by right of conquest—conquest
by the genius of Will of Stratford.
Mrs. Mortimer Richards wore the golden
plaits and the innocent blues of Desdemona.
Three Juliets, two Portias (one of these was
Sybil Morrison, barrister-at-law; the other
the brilliant Marie Bentivoglio) and two
Beatrices—one of them actress Renee Kelly
accompanied by Pirie Bush as a Hamlet who
had evidently dressed with the idea of going-
on to Moore Park Golf Links. Mrs. Harold
Vale wore the white funnel-like headpiece of
Mistress Quickly with charm, and much the
same headgear swathed Mrs. Godhard from
the chin up. Sir Dudley and Lady de Chair
(she in a fascinating mixture of old rose
and gold) came on to the ball after the
Bard’s birthday party at the Uni. They
brought the Mungo MaoCallums, the Elliott
Lewis couple of Tasmania, and new Doctor
of Laws Priminister Bruce and his lady.
Mark Sheldon, acting-president of the E.-S.
Union, was there, a look of bitter calcula-
tion in his eye as he mentally measured
the length of fabric required by the ladies
of olden times, and reflected on the three-
quarters of a yard that clothes the modern
species.
Back to the stage came Sweet Nell last
week to raise funds for the radium needle
she is giving to Sydney Hospital. And in
what play should she come back but the
romance with which her own name is indis-
solubly linked—“ Sweet Nell of Old Drury”?
The Opera House was packed to the ceiling
to see Australia’s old favorite trip through
the story of that “most happy woman” Mis-
tress Gwynne. And not even the most carp-
ing youngster went away disappointed.
Pretty foot and arm, merry eye and pleasing
voice proved just as potent as mother and
father had told a hundred times.
Lee White, sparkling like hoar-frost under
a cloak of flame, makes a startling entity in
“Keep Smiling,” the Palace revue. The
frock of white triple georgette is hand-sewn,
with brilliants from hem to shoulder-straps.
The cloak is entirely composed of ostrich-
feathers mounted on georgette. Another
dress in Nile-blues represents a scarab. The
front panel blazes with a myriad charms of
Egypt worked in topaz, sapphire and rubies,
and the back presents the smooth, unbroken
surface of the ancient mascot. With this
is worn a train of beaten silver linked as
closely as chain-mail. But the most in-
triguing apparel of all is of rich Canton
crepe. In this she is meant to typify the
spirit of running water. Over the shoulders
fall cascades of brilliants; from each hip,
too, a flashing stream ripples. The edge of
the skirt is gripped in the jewelled feet of
a regal flamingo, about his graceful shins a
lush growth of bulrushes. The bird rears
a proud and roseate chest; finally, with a
toss of his dazzling crest, he ends just under
Lee’s chin. But you chn’t satisfy everybody.
One man in the O.P. box had a grouch.
“There’s the stork, all right, and there’s the
bulrushes; but where’s Moses?”
“I drink to the Australian press!” cried
Pavlova, suiting the action to the word at
the Institute of Journalists’ lunch in her
honor. A straight frock and a little hugging
hat of deep coral enwrapped slim Vivacity,
who only grew serious when Brunsdon Fletcher
uttered a prayerful ejaculation for Peace in
Russia. Pavlova’s tall, grave, grey-haired
husband was touched by the president’s re-
ference to Sovietland, and remarked that
this -was the first time in their travels
a sympathetic appreciation of their country
had warmed their hearts. Dutch journalist
Mrs. Weersma had a glass raised in her
honor and smiled gaily under a Minerva-like
helmet of silver tissue;
This is a last-minute picture of Marjory
Arnold, taken by Dayne, and is of interest
because she
has been a
very vital
member of
the selection
committee of
the Women
Painter s’
Slio w. The
exhibition at
the Education
Gallery will be
opened by the
State vicereine
this afternoon.
Miss Arnold
has the dis-
tinction of be-
ing one of the
original mem-
bers of the so-
ciety, which
she joined at
the first meet-
ing called in
the studio of Miss Cusack in the days when
she was a flapper student in Miss Cusack’s
classes. The Sydney Royal Art Society and
the Slade School have left their mark on her
work; and for the last 16 months she has
been toiling hard in Paris. She gleaned
from Bissier, Fauconnier and the Grand
Chanmiere, and is now seriously devoting
herself to life studies. Eric Scott, a Sydney
etcher, quite a rage in Paris and America,
was among the successful Australians she
met. Another rapid climber is Olive Crane.
Marjory and Olive were the only two Aus-
tralians engaged to work on the decorations
of the British Pavilion at the Paris Exhibi-
tion of Decorative Arts; at this small Wem-
bley the applied art of every European
nation except Germany was on view.
Next Sunday coincides with a day known
amongst the Chosen as Lag B’Omer, which
stands as a sort of wedding-day oasis in the
50-day desert wherein marriages may not be
celebrated between the children of Israel.
The period is that of “the counting of the
Omer,” and the one-day exception is the
33rd of the Omer. A great epidemic
ravaged the Israelites, and it was on this
day that the last victim, a noted scholar,
died. The exception was made in token of
thankfulness for the passing of the plague;
and because of a certain distinction given
to the day, it is usually rushed by brides.
The bright young face looking out from
this window is owned by Cecil John F.
Purdy, son of
S y d n e y’s
Health Officer,
and it is as
young as it
looks iust
20. The boy
flashed into
notice as a
chess player,
one of the
N.S.W. side
in an inter-
state match,
when only 16:
i n 1924 h e
actually won
the Maoriland
championship,
though Spencer
Crakanthorp
took it from
him at the last
congress,
Purdv winning
first prize in the consolation class; and he
ran third in the recently-held Australian
championship. He was one of the brilliant
scholars of Cranbrook School, and is now
going through an Arts course on an exhibi-
tion won at the Leaving Certificate examina-
tion. His rare talents will probably be de-
voted to latv.
Much sympathy goes out to Oswald
Cheeke over the death of his mother, Mrs.
Selina Cheeke. The lady, who was one of
the three good-looking daughters of W. A.
Long (one of them married James Martin,
the other W. B. Dailey), was well in her
eighties when the end came. A remarkable
point is that Wamboin, where she died, is
one of several houses built in what was the
garden surrounding the home to which she
went as a bride. Mrs. Cheeke, who had been
absent from Australia for half a lifetime, re-
turned “for a short visit” last Spring. Her
husband was associate to his uncle, one of
the first of our Supreme Court judges.
“In death they were not divided” applied
to the parents of Jimmy Lawson, the Sydney
auctioneer who makes business his jest and
jest his business when handling a saleroom
crowd. James Lawson the elder, who had
reached 90, died last Friday, and his wife,
who was his junior by only two years, slipped
away next morning. The old couple had lived
on the mountains, at Springwood, for 35
years.
Couriers continue to arrive with tidings
of further splendors of the Falkiner-Lowry
matrimonial venture of last week. Every-
thing that could be gold was gold—gold plate
on golden tablecloths, gold baskets spilling
with blooms (all out of season), gold wed-
ding bells, gold in the bridesmaids’ dresses
and flowers and gold sunshine. And where
the gold wasn’t actually visible one sensed
it flowing from the Falkiner bank account to
the florist, the dressbuilder, the caterer;
even to the stonemason, for a flight of steps
had been specially laid on to the laurelled
marquee at Tokay where the reception was
held. The wedding frock was soft beauty
in duchesse point and georgette, and drew a
long and sinuous train of ivory satin sus-
tained by rucked georgette and embellished
by duchesse lace, heather and orange blos-
som. A mellow old lace veil, banded to the
head with pearls, was worth more than its
weight in gold.
Old-time journalist and now successful
dentist Ernest Blackwell saw son Clive off
the slips into the sea of matrimony last week
at St. Stephen’s. The bride, May Gordon
Willis, is the daughter of old family friends
and North Shore line neighbors. Dr. Sinclair
Gillies squired the bride up the aisle in her
frock of ivory georgettes embossed in chenille
and patterned in gold. The dress drew a long
foam of georgette and velvet shot with gold,
and this was followed by three maids in
blue and silver. The Queen’s Club put the
final marcel in the festivities.
William Johnston, of Noumea, found his
bride in Mosman. The lady was, till Canon
Bellingham said the necessary words last
week, Bonnie Innes, of the red-roofed sub-
urb. St. Philip’s blessed the vows, and
Petty’s filled the glasses.
“Poss” Nivison, of Ohio, Walcha, who lias
just become engaged to Nancy, only daughter
of the Hugh Munros, of Keera, Bingara,
is a lucky man. Nancy is small, pretty and
a country girl to the marrow. In the inter-
vals of riding and motoring she doctors as
successfully as a vet. any sick horse, dog or
cat around the homestead. Another of her
hobbies is running a free library at Keera
for the workers on the station. When her
mother was president of the Country Wo-
men’s Association it was Nancy who brought
before the first conference the discomfort of
the seats in country schools and the absurd
programmes the film firms released to country
patrons. Mother is at present in India with
her sister, Mrs. Evan Thomas.
The railway people got a surprise at the
unexpected crowding of the train from
Molong to Sydney recently; the rush was
caused by the pilgrimage of some of Mrs.
Alexander Giffin’s 175 descendants —they in-
clude 70 grandchildren, 87 great-grand-
children and 6 of the newest generation—on
the way to Cronulla to honor the old lady's
centenary. The great event occurred on the
21st, and it found the lady clear-eyed and
clear-headed enough to recognise all her visi-
tors in spite of their multitude.
The dance at the Yacht Club at Kirribilli
the other night might be described as a four-
candlepower entertainment. But then it
wasn’t meant to be a high-voltage affair.
Ever and anon the old salts and the slightly-
salted members of the club become neigh-
borly and have in the wives and best girls
of all concerned. Then are gay awnings and
festive lanterns hung about the club verandah
that seems about to launch itself into Port
Jackson, so that, given the right partner,
deluded couples have been known to imagine
themselves fox-trotting on some seventh wave
of Romance. A nice bright moon and the
sky’s complete equipment of stars were served
with the dance last week. The garden, too,
suggested possibilities to the explorer; but
maybe the affair was too small-and-early
even for that.
Something of the glory that was Greece
still springs to life when the Greek colony
sets about giving an entertainment. This
year a pretty ballet told the story of Cupid
and Psyche in an interval of jazz at the
Greek ball in aid of the Children’s Hospital.
Under a flowery arch that gave them wel-
come, hundreds passed on their way to the
Ambassadors’ ballroom, for the affair was
one of the most crowded of the week. Mrs.
A. J. Lenos, who was president of the dance,
glittered in lame set in silver, and vice-
president Rita Fox happily combined black
velvets and white georgettes.
Clients of the Hotel Australia have been
shocked by the death of Mabel Bouffler, who
had controlled the book and art stall for a
number of years. Miss Bouffler was a dis-
criminating collector of books and pictures,
and her knowledge was always at the dis-
posal of the hotel’s visitors. Sister Ethel is
carrying on in her place.
Mrs. Klymmup was giving her first really
triumphant party in her palatial seaside
home, when her social sponsor was horrified
to hear her remark to the exclusive social
capture who had proved elusive for months:
“So glad you approve of me having the party
here. I think these quiet homicidal enter-
tainments are always the happiest.”
Mrs. Tony Hordern has settled down in
London for at least a year, but her husband
is planning to return within six months. The
children have been placed in schools. Mrs.
Tony’s mother, Mrs. Bingham, is living
handily, and her eldest sister, who married
a soldier of renown, lives near his job at
Aldershot.
Miss Brisbane goes the rounds:—
The Apollos had the first concert of their season
in the Exhibition concert hall. Leonard Francis
waved the baton and both “Little Billie” and “Tann-
hauser” were on the programme—Winnie Dunoon
was Elizabeth and Gerwyr* Jones Wolfram.
Mrs. J. O’Neill Brenan had a bridge and mah-jongg
party in the new lounge at Oxford House in aid of
the R.S.P.C.A. The game was played in the lower
section, where the color scheme is orange and black,
and scenes from the Persian poet who preferred a
jug of wine and thou to mah-jongg and row decorate
the walls. Bridge was played in the upper lounge, a
palm grove for the afternoon.
Eddie Cahill and George Brooke are to have a
Civic Reception. They are back wondering how it
all happened.
Wild white flowers dressed up the Ann-street kirk
for the wedding of Eric Duncombe, of Springhill,
elder son of the F. J. Duncombes of Stratton, to
Hazel Campbell, daughter of the G. B. Campbells of
Clayfleld. An arch of fern and chrysanthemums,
with a white wedding bell, was overhead, and pink
and white flowers were about the pulpit. The bride
said “I do” in ivory mariette with a veil of Brussels
rose-point, and the bridesmaids, Edna and Marion
Campbell and M. Duncombe, wore jacaranda blue
over peach pink. Pink roses and antignon graced the
tables at the National. Mrs. Campbell received in
black and gold; Mrs. Duncombe wore henna and
black brocade.
The Albert-street Methodist Church saw the
marriage of Arthur Tuckett to Lex Brodie, daughter
of the late Alex. Brodie and Mrs. Brodie, of Oxley.
The bride was in ivory mariette, Dorothy Morley, her
cousin, ’maiding in pale blue.
Toowoomba has been going gay over its annual
show. A new item this year was a Baby Competition.
Between 20 and 30 entries were judged by Dr. Glen
Hickey and Matron Armstrong; in the under-12
months class, James Archibald Young got first and
Robert Fetherstone second. Boys carried off most
of the prizes. The luncheon drew a big crowd, Mrs.
A. E. Moore wearing grey mauve floral marocain, Mrs.
Llewellyn brown and gold, Mrs. Annand brown, Mrs.
Wolfgang Hunt grey, and Mrs. D. Crammond’s navy
blue mariette had a pattern in henna. Many Bris-
banites went up. The Country Women’s Association
had a Rest tent for visitors, with Mrs. Fairfax to
superintend. A hundred babies patronised t*he
creche, amongst them triplets—said to be the best
behaved of the hundred.

Your Personal Responsibility.
Do you bring to your personal affairs the same careful thought that you give
to your own or your employer’s business?
One of your main business principles is to save money where possible, and to
spend wisely when spend you must. Is your own personal income so great that
you can afford to be less careful in saving, less wise in the spending of it?
Practically every man has family or other responsibility, and knows the need
for economy.

Anzac Day broke clear and cold ; but, alas
for hopes raised at daAvn! it was in pelting
rain that 10.000 of those who had gone to
war marched to the Exhibition. Yet a fine
sight was Melbourne's first big effort to
make Anzac Day a fitting celebration
of a great memory. “Once a soldier
always a soldier” proved true in the
case of the A.I.F. men—those thousands
in sac suits, civvy overcoats and felt hats
who swung along in perfect step. There was
very little khaki, but a wealth of medals.
At the head alone w r alked General Monash,
leading his unarmed army. The Air Force
pilots and mechanics made a bright spot amid
the companies in mufti; three officers in their
front line carried laurel wreaths to lay upon
the cenotaph at the steps of Federal Parlia-
ment House. The police who had seen ser-
vice were well represented in the ranks, and
so were the Imperial and South African
forces. Many motor-cars conveyed limbless
and invalided soldiers, and even a few cot-
cases were in covered motor-vehicles near the
head of the procession. Despite the rain
there were thousands of onlookers every-
where to give the men a cheer.
The cenotaph, a copy of the one raised in
simple grandeur beside the Thames, was a
beautiful if breath-catching sight, rising to
the memory of the Glorious Dead from a
bed of flowers that seemed to cover a new-
made grave.
The initial Boucicault performance of
Barrie’s “Admirable Crichton” drew record
patronage to the King’s. Society’s chief in-
terest was in Mary Hinton Pitt-Rivers, who
made her first bow professionally here in the
role of the languid Lady Mary Lasenby.
She looked the part admirably, in silver and
blue lame, with a cloudy top-dressing of blue.
With the rest of the fair ladies stranded on
the desert island, she adopted Robinson
Crusoe-like apparel, returning in the last act
to the less voluminous covering which mod-
ern society terms evening-dress, some gold
lame and lace drapes filling the bill. Joan
Radford and Betty Schuster, who completed
the trio of spoilt daughters of the Earl of
Loam, wore dainty party-frocks in both first
and last acts, and Violet Sterne as the
Countess of Brocklehurst added splendor in
black and silver robing. Angela Baddeley
appeared in the conventional garb of the
stage maid as Tweeny. By request of the
perturbed producer, no flowers were handed
over the footlights; even the late. G.-G.’s
daughter had to collect her little lot back of
stage. The Norton Grimwade couple, the
Russell Clarkes —she in a cosmos-mauve
gow r n—and Marie Greene, who accompanied
them, with a necklace of crystal sparkling
upon a robe of two shades of petunia, were
an eye-taking group in the stalls. The d.c.
galaxy included Mrs. Lascelles and her two
daughters, lately returned from Europe.
“The Bad Man,” G. B. Post’s new offering
at the Royal, has a title to draw the crowd
that hungers for thrills. It got them, and
plenty of laughs, too, from the gay Mexican
bandit who wasn’t such a bad chap after
all. Society on Saturday night divided itself
nicely between the Royal and the King’s;
both harbored first performances. Some of
the heads of the Firm looked in at the Post
show for a critical peep. Perhaps that was
why the Murkan star, all upholstered, em-
broidered and walnut-stained, poured bless-
ing on the J.C.W. name in his speech after
the fall of the curtain. The two lasses of
the piece, Eileen Sparks and Cecil Haines,
displayed but one frock each, pretty, but
neither of supreme interest. The Bests,
with daughters Margot and Phyllis, occu-
pied a box; Dorothy Brunton and Colonel
and Mrs. Watson applauded from another,
and Mrs. Harry Emmerton gave an air of
opulence to the d.c. front row with her coat
of ermine. The good-looking Bates matron
had pink leaves crowning her greying locks,
and an arresting gold coat. A trio who
sported something specially smart in evening
wraps were Mrs. Douglas Stewart, Mrs. It.
Fitcher and Lilian Cassidy.
Winter came last week, and with it the
wearing of the green. At the Caulfield races
many fair patrons were in verdure clad, so
far as color went, anyway—not the tender
green of early spring, but the fuller
richer hue of early summer. This mode of
attire, with dress and flat of the same shade,
was adopted in so many cases as to cause
some humorous mistakes and several apolo-
gies. Very nice, too, and quite becoming
were the jumper and tailored suits and top-
coats of bottle tone. Some wearers of the
favorite hue at the V.A.T.C. meeting were
Mrs. H. S. K. Ward, Mrs. Fred Krcrouse.
pretty Beryl Cunningham and Mrs. Cust.
Secretary H. V. Kewney’s attractive wife
had a black satin coat and furs over a gown
cheered with Oriental embroidery, allied to
a feathered hat. Ada Reeve, just in from
the other side, and looking younger than on
her last visit, was in black-and-white check
with a squirrel coat.
The burning of the Shakspeare Memorial
Theatre, at Stratford-on-Avon and the
world-wide appeal for funds to rebuild the
historic playhouse have shaken up interest
in the deceased playwright, and two celebra-
tions of his birthday, which fell last Friday,
were announced locally. Mrs. Dyer, as re-
presentative of the British Music Society,
therefore ante-dated her festivities, which
took place on Tuesday at Kinnoull. As
usual the lady provided a charming setting
for her guests ; all who helped in the enter-
tainment were in the raiment of some char-
acter of the Bard’s creation. The hostess
was radiant in peacock-green and gold bro-
cade, with white muslin head-dress, as Mis-
tress Ann Page; Lesley Merrick, daughter
of Leonard, the author, and Mrs. Mansley
Greer were others of the Merry Wives of
Windsor. The charming folk from “A Mid-
summer Night’s Dream" formed a tableau in
the drawing-room, and Titania (Viola
Morris) and Peaseblossom (Lilian Crisp),
with Henry Trompf as jester, sang Shaks-
pearean songs expressively. Professor W.
A. Osborne, as president of the Shakspeare
Society, put in a plea for funds to help
the memorial theatre to be a phoenix. The
call to supper provided a surprise, for the
dining-room table was arranged as an Eliza-
bethan garden with a paved path, a wee sun-
dial and borders of real pansies, rosemary
and such.
Gwen Horne, who has chosen water-color
as her medium, is pictured here in serious
mood. She re-
ceived her first
art training at
S w i n b urne
College, and
then spent
nearly tw o
years abroad
learning a bit
more, and get-
ting fresh
atmosphere. At
the Chau-
miere School
in Paris she

some months,
and she had a-

nal and his

With Lilian Pentland, a
gallery student of Melbourne, she joined the
sketching classes of Frederick Whiting in
Sussex one. August, and the next year at
Montreuil in France. From St. Ives, in
Cornwall, where she shared a studio with
another Victorian, Elma Roach, Miss Horne
has brought back some picturesque bits,
which were shown lately among other of her
works at the Decoration Galleries. She has
now settled down after her wanderings to
paint her own busli-lands and train Young
Australians. She is art-teacher at Lauriston
College. Morven.
The Embassy’s former icy whiteness was
seen to be mellowed to ivory, with panelling
of pink, grey and gold and window-boxes
beneath curtains of old rose, when the estab-
lishment threw open its doors to jazz for
the first time this season. Jennie Brenan, in
a shaded pink-and-amber gown, bearing in
crystal a design like a wind-swept fern, scat-
tered among her patrons numerous novelties,
trifles collected during her recent look-in at
the Big Smoke and Paris. Pretty articles
of colored paper, dainty miniature felt hats
and the latest of dolls were distributed. These
dolls are to be the special draw of the season
at this rendezvous, for every evening some
fair dancer will find she has a lucky ticket
enabling her to say “Mine” to one of these
smart little mannikins and maidikins. In-
terludes in a particularly bright evening were
furnished by exhibition dances by Vivienne
Knox-Ivniglit, whose powder-blue frock was
a firmament sprinkled with crescent moons
and twinkling stars, and Marie Tait, a
daughter of the Charles Taits, in a white geor-
gette frock of much fullness, embroidered
in glistening beads. Both lasses stepped it
with Frank Alderson—the former in tango
and foxtrot, the latter in the Charleston.
It was remarked that the dancing mode
of the moment seems to require more space
than has latterly been consumed by an equal
number of trippers.
St. Paul’s spires may now be said to be
really and truly begun; for though scaffold-
ing has reared itself over the sacred edifice
for some time, it was not until Sunday of
last week that operations received the bless-
ing of the Church, given in the presence of
much attractive millinery, mainly clerical.
There were crowds within and without the
cathedral, and the history of the Anglican
Church in Victoria began a new chapter.
A hearty response to the appeal for funds
to : crown, as it were, the historic church has
resulted to date in £40,000 of the £70,000
being subscribed. The committee hopes that
as the central spire rises, adding a new
beauty and dignity to the cathedral and a
gracious adornment to the city, the remain-
ing £30,000 will be forthcoming.
For weeks events have conspired to pre-
vent the wives of Melbourne aldermen and
councillors from carrying out their intention
to hand a gift to the Mayoress commemora-
tive of her husband’s knighthood. After a
series of postponements the little ceremony
has at last taken place. In the private
drawing-room at the Town Hall a crystal bowl
was handed over by the Town Clerk, on be-
half of a large feminine assemblage. The
recipient, whose black gown and velvet hat
had a background of pink chrysanthemums
and carnations, said her thanks, and then
everyone relaxed gratefully as the clock
struck four. ,
Well-laid plans for die unveiling of the
Maryborough War Meinorial, the tribute of
the women of the district,: have miscarried.
When it was seen that the big bronze,
Margaret Baskerville’s work, could not be
in position and the monument completed for
Anzae Day, the ceremony was hurriedly
transferred to King’s Birthday, June 7.
The George Swinburnes are about to lose
daughter Edith, who leaves by the Diogenes
to keep a marriage contract with Dr. Clif-
ford Ellingwortli in London. The doctor is
a Box Hill (Melbourne) boy who, after a
brilliant medical course in London, decided
to stay there and practise.
The day on which the Clive Baillieus wel-
comed home their daughter Jean from Paris
saw the passing of her cousin King, the
Arthur Baillieus’only son, who two years ago
married Gracie, Lavers. It was a tragically
sudden blow ; an ordinary cold that turned
to pneumonia. The young couple recently
moved into the house they had built on the
Trawalla estate, and sympathy is being
heaped on the little widow.
The Clive Gaunts, from Singapore, are
unpacking for a short stay in Melbourne.
He is closely related to the Gaunts who
have given an admiral or two to the navy,
and she was a Morrison of Geelong. Mary
Morrison, who also has been in “the East’’
a year or so, has just returned.
Mrs. Ivan Gutmann, who with her husband
is now aboard the Oronsay, called her friends
together at the Oriental. The lady, who
wore champagne-hued felt millinery with a
black bead-encrusted frock, cheered with re-
seda-green, and a black coat edged with
white fur, raised longings in many breasts
when outlining her itinerary, which includes
peeps at Naples, the Tyrol, Riviera, Paris
and London; then home via America and
Japan. Phyllis Fuller, also a traveller by
the same boat, was there in a kasha coat
covering an accordoon-pleated frock of
geranium-red hue, with felt hat in tune.
When George Rex, as Duke of York,
visited Brisbane with liis lady, umteen thou-
sa n d school
children from
all parts were
collected to
raise their
voices in “God
Save.” Among
these young
Cornstalks was
a smal I boy
from Been-
leigh visiting
the capital for
the first time.
This taste of
the city and
the limelight
and the glamor
of royalty was
so much to
his liking that
since then he
has attained
the distinction
of being the
only Bananaland musician who has had a
command appearance in London. The pian-
ist is Edward Cahill, who with his co-worker
of some 10 years’ standing, baritone George
Brooke, of Melbourne, put back to Australia
lately after over three years of wonderful
success in Britain. They intend to make
a concert tour of their native land before
returning to England in January of next
year.
A cable tells of the death in a railway
accident at Spezzia, Italy, of Miss Jeanie
Jobson, M.A., whose name deserves to be
remembered for her patriotic zeal during the
war years. As senior mistress of the Bal-
larat High School from its foundation, she
endeared herself to innumerable students.
Failing eyesight forced her retirement from
the Education Department, and the greater
part of recent years has been spent in travel
abroad. There is a sister at Pymble (Syd-
ney). and Alec Jobson, the accountant, is
a brother.
The W. iC. Guthries, of East St. Ivilda,
had a wedding tea at Menzies’ after daugh-
ter Wilma Margaret had become Mrs. W. A.
Cuming. The Rev. Leonard Arnold had put
the usual questions to the parties at the
chapel of the Church of England Grammar
School, decorated for the occasion with
autumn blossoms and foliage, with crimson
berries. The bride, who had two ’maids in
blue, wore a trained gown of ivory crepe de
Chine prinked up with gold embroidery, with
a veil of old lace of filmy softness. Mr. and
Mrs. Alex. Stewart, Major and Mrs. Harry
Cuming, the J. Burns Cumings (Adelaide)
and the S.A. knight Lennon Raws and his
wife were at the after-rejoicings.
The very latest of evening gowns, which
comes from Brussels, combines taffeta and
georgette, and mingles in its design the early-
Yictorian and the straight slim lines of the
mode of the moment. A model viewed last
week suggested a tropical sunset. The com-
plete front half was deep amber georgette
with heavy embroidery of gold beads in varied
tones; shot taffeta of harmonising hue
formed the back half, full and bunchy, with
fussy frills, made bunchier by a big bow at
the waist-line. It was rather too freaky to
be pretty, though each half separately was
charming.
Members of the Women’s Citizens’ League
and sister societies are sighing for recogni-
tion of their fitness to act as J’s.P. and
jurors, conceded in other States. Two depu-
tations have lately waited upon the Attorney-
General and demanded the boon. Barrister
Mrs. Joan Rosanove was one of the spokes-
women, also Mrs. Ross Watt, who has the
distinction of being a councillor. The good
accomplished by England’s 1100 women jus-
tices and by admission of women to the jury-
box was, of course, cited. The law as it
stands requires the gentlemen of the jury to
be over 35 years of age, but this regulation
seemingly holds no terror for the earnest
souls who demand their rights.
Last American mail tells of a three
months’ holiday jaunt just completed by Enid
Bennett and her husband, Fred Niblo. They
wandered through the Holy Land and into
Iraq, visiting Jerusalem, Damascus, Bagdad
and other places of renown. The pilgrimage
followed on the completion of the new "Ben
Hur” film which producer Fred directed in
Rome and Los Angeles, and which is claimed
to have cost five million dahlers.
Sister Adelaide of things seen and heard:
The E. A. Brooks had the first big dance of
the season, the occasion the coming out of elder
daughter Barbara, and the setting the Floating
Palais. There were pink roses and pink-shaded lights
to reflect the beaded pink of the debutante’s frock.
Of four other damsels who made their bow on the
same evening (Audrey Young, Mavis Marsh, Bay
Sinclair and Margaret Salter), two were pink-clad and
two all white and silver. Mrs. Brook’s own froc-k
was jade green; so was that of Mrs. Wallace Bruce.
High praise is due to Miss Violet de Mole for her
production of De Banville’s “Gringoire” and her
delightful stage setting—all tapestries and fifteenth-
century furniture and dressing. She herself was
Nicole, with Clive Carey in the name part and
Miss Laybourne Smith as a graceful, charming Loyse.
Proceeds are for the Tubercular Soldiers’ Aid Society
and the Aged Poor of Dernancourt. A satisfactorily
large audience included Lady Bridges and a party
from Government House.
Thursday saw the marriage of Doreen, daughter
of A. E. and the late Mrs. Rowley, to John Good-
child. The white and gold bride had no brides-
maids, but her sister, Mrs. Rosslvn Morris, was
matron of honor in apricot crSpe de Chine with
hints of fur and a sheaf of autuinn-hued flowers.
The public had its first view of St. Mark’s, resi-
dential college at a fete held in the grounds. Mrs.
G. E. Good headed the committee responsible for
the admirably stocked stalls, and in the evening
bridge-players filled the rooms to overflowing. In
the year of its existence the college has filled its
original building (the old John Downer home) and
built itself a wing which, at the present rate of
growing, should soon expand into a quadrangle.
The same afternoon, and a perfect one at. that, saw
a. garden party at Victoria Park and the Amateur
Turf Club’s meeting at Cheltenham, whereat Mrs. W.
B. Carr, in cinnamon brown, hostessed the com-
mittee’s lunch and tea. The Governor and Lady
Bridges were there, she brown-clad too, with a
bordering of bronze coque feathers about her coat;
they brought Miss Desiree Brooke, whose brown hat
topped a frock of pink. The garden party was by
way of celebrating the opening of Francis Xavier’s
Cathedral and mustered four or five thousand guests.
The cathedral, by the way, added over £7OOO to
its bank balance in donations and collection at the
next day’s services.
Visitors to this village include Sir Amberson and
Lady Marten —he one of Bombay’s High Court Judges
and a cousin of Dr. R. H. Marten.
When the Governor’s lady stayed the night in
Robe on her way to Mt. Gambier, she was in a little
town closely connected with her husband’s family.
George Danby (born Affleck), the Governor’s uncle,
is taking his last rest in the Robe cemetery; he
succeeded to his uncle’s estates in England and took
the name also. Preferring Australian life, he built
a home, which he called Lakeside, near Robe, and
brought furniture, pictures and other heirlooms from
the English estates. When he died and his family
scattered, some of the contents of the house were
sold. A marble bath is in Robe’s only hotel and
the Keith Bowmans have the dining-room table.

This Company is being’ formed for the purpose of supplying the City of Melbourne, and its
suburbs with a most modern and efficient fleet of Taxi Cabs.
The Checker design has been adopted because the Checker Cab name and organisation is
world famous. The design and the name Checker have been registered and protected by law
against imitations throughout Austialia.
A company of similar name is operating in Sydney and has now 40 cabs actually plying
it.r hire on the Sydney streets, and is continually adding new units to its fleet. These Cabs
are of the same uniform design as those suggested for this company, but the latter will have
minor improvements that experience has suggested. It is desirable that cabs of the same name
and similar design and of the same distinctive appearance should be running in other capital
cities, so that interstate travellers who are used to riding in a particular type of cab will
naturally ask for a cab similar toi those used in their own city.
The advantage of companies operating in different States with the same equipment is too
obvious to need stressing. The principal service in Auckland (N.Z.) is also known as the
Checker, and the same name is well and favorably known throughout the whole of the United
States. It will be seen that the advantage to this company of being associated in name and
design with the premier Taxi Service in the main cities of Australasia is highly important.
The Chassis adopted is the well-known Six-cylinder Buick, as used by many leading American
Taxi Cab Companies, and is probably the best and most favorably known car in Australia.
Consistent with its other equipment, the meter (the Ohmer) used is the best obtainable —-
a receipt-giving, practically infallible meter, approved by police and traffic authorities throughout
the world. These meters are now being used with complete success in the Sydney fleet, and they
are used also by virtually all the leading American companies. This meter is specially constructed
and sealed to prevent interference by the driver, therefore the hirer is protected against incorrect
fares.
The fact that the company will operate on an entirely cash basis will enable the directors
to commence operations with a fleet of at least 80 cabs, and have! ample funds for registration,
insurance, garage equipping, garage equipment, telephone, organisation, etc.
Twenty Cabs of the accented design are already definitely ordered, and will, it is expected,
be plying on the streets in July next. Tentative arrangements have been made for very quick
following deliveries.
The Company will be listed for official quotation upon the
principal Stock Exchanges.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The resumption of suburban meetings in
Sydney enabled horses that ran well at Randwick
without getting into the winning list to pick up
decent races. There were only five commoners opposed
to Night Heron, most consistent of Sydney nags, in
the Moorefield Handicap at Kogarah, and Teddy Keys’s
meal-ticket never left the odds (7 to 4 on) in doubt.
He is as honest a horse as ever looked through a
bridle, and has amply repaid the ministrations of
the capable veteran who owns and trains him. It
was Irish Prince’s turn in the Holiday Handicap at
Rosehill on Monday. Dick Wootton’s horse and
Hermealdo shared favoritism at 7 to 4 and fought
out the finish, the Prince winning cleverly by a
neck in 2min. 20sec. for the 11 furlongs. Having-
proved that he likes a distance, this fine-looking-
four-year-old may now be' reserved for one of the
big spring handicaps, and he will not lack support.
Backers had a trifle the better of things both at
Moorefield and Rosehill, which is a change.
“S.G.”: Night Heron hasn’t been out of a place
in his last 11 starts. This is his worthy record:
Third to Greendale and Murray King, 10-furlong
handicap, Moorefield, February 6 ; third tq Stony and
Belle Shot, Parramatta Mile, Rosehill, February 10 ;
second to Valdorea, Granville Stakes, nine furlongs,
Rosehill, February 13 ; second to Mikaro, 11-furlong
handicap, Canterbury Park, February 27 ; first R.vdal-
inere Mile, Rosehill, March 6; first Hawkesbury
Autumn Handicap, 11 furlongs, Moorefield, March
13; third to Shrapnel and Naos, A.J.C. Tocal Handi-
cap, 12 furlongs, Randwick, April 3; second to
Gaelic Maid, Highweight Mile, Randwick, April 5;
third to Pantheon and Player, Dangar Handicap, 12
furlongs, Randwick, April io ; third to Resource and
Tibbie, City Tattersall’s Cup, 11 furlongs, Randwick,
April 17; first Moorefield Handicap, 10 furlongs, April
24—three firsts, three seconds and five thirds. By
Night Hawk, who won the 1913 English St. Legei
(at 50 to, 1), out of a St. Alwyne mare, he hasn’t
a vestige of brilliancy, but succeeds bj r dint of sheer
pluck and staying-power. A one-run horse like
Murray King, he might, had he been nominated for
the Sydney Cup, have beaten the erratic Comedy
King gelding at his own game. However, Teddy
Keys may yet win a Cup with his hardy bay, who is
only in his fifth year.
* * * *
“11 a,sen” ; The wave of disappointment at
passing through Sydney too late for the third and
too early for the fourth day Of the Randwick Easter
meeting swept me on its crest to the £lOOO trotting
fixture at Victoria Park. I know nothing of trotters
and their -ways, so I paid Is. to one of a score of
yelling urchins who were selling the tips of —call
him Spoofer, “picked five winners at Epping.” 1
was given a sealed envelope which, when opened,
presented a ragged, dirty scrap of paper with
names of horses scrawled on it in distinctly childish
pencilling. Nastily suspicious, I compared with other
buyers of tips. Though their envelopes were exactly
similar (plain white with the name “Spoofer” stamped
on them), I found that the dinkum forecasts were
on printed dodgers, and did not agree in any case
with mine. Simple enough—all that was needed
was the wherewithal to buy some cheap envelopes and
a rubber stamp. But I foresee a large future for
that 12-year-old.
* * * *
Cecil Godby has got hold of a promising
hurdler in Jollity (Comedy King—Ellen Graeme),
who easily took the race over the battens at Sandown
Park (Vic.) on Saturday. Jollity was a 6-to-4
favorite, so punters who followed the stable lead
began -well, but subsequent proceedings were not so
satisfactory. MeShortodds had a “skinner” in the
two-year-old race, the weU-backed Master Trillion
finding the straight too long and striking his colors
to Achilleid (33 to 1), who is by All Black —-
Achilla—a real Maoriland pedigree. However, the
Nassau-Bray ton gelding Affirm, who had run a close
second to Batteryman in the Glenhuntly Cup, came
to light in the Park Handicap, for which he was
always favorite, his closing quote being 6 to 4.
Leading all the way, he won nicely from Miss
Meadowes (5 to 1) and Corncrake (8 to 1). Affirm
must have had a good deal in hand, for, carrying a
71b. penalty in the Eight Hours Handicap at Moonee
Valley, and going out at 6 to 1, he beat Batteryman
(5 to 1) and Oriental Gem (12 to 1) pointless.
Ridden on both occasions by Daniels, he ran the
10 furlongs at the Park in 2min. lOsec. and the 12
furlongs at the Valley in 2min. 32sec. The useful
fellow is owned by G. Harris and trained by F. G.
Doran. »

“Ascot” : The tipster of the Brisbane tote,
who indicates his selections by means of check
words printed on the tote tickets, is still going
strong. As souvenirs of the last Ascot meeting 1
have tickets labelled “Blotto” (horse left at post),
“Clumsily” (ridden by apprentice), “Chubby” (too
fat), “Parsley” (too green), “Gote” (should have
been “Goat”), “Drawback” and “Peculiar.” They
all ran accordingly. I had hopes of “Conducive,”
but it didn’t prove so; and “Artisan” held a stop-
work meeting half-way through the race. The tote
tipster slipped only once, to my knowledge: he
marked an undersized outsider “Childish.” It ran
second, and I collected.
* * * *
“Petrie”: Goodna, a pony-racing course
near Brisbane, is appropriately situated. The State’s
largest hospital for the insane is right opposite.
# * * *
“Bris”: A Brisbane punter has improved
on the system adopted by “Mars” (B. 22/4/’26). He
collects the tips of all the dailies and the weekly
sporting sheets, marks them off in his book, and
then backs on the tote every horse not tipped. He
claims to be ahead of the game ; he certainly catches
all the big dividends.
* * * «
“E.K.”: The two-up school at Innisfail
(N.Q.) is a small affair compared with one at
Nelson, in the Mulgrave district. There the scholars
study in a marquee, with a padded ring built up in
the middle. The game is scrupulously fair, and if the
luck would only hold there is always £5OOO to be
won. Bets over the hundred are common any Sunday
morning.
* * * #
Stadiums, Ltd., has imported a typical
U.S. preliminary fighter in Izzy Tanner, the ’Frisco
Hebrew, who made his Australian debut at Sydney on
Saturday night. Weighing lOst. 91b. to Fred Brock’s
lOst. 8-Jlb., the sturdily-built visitor essayed to
knock the polished pupil of Dave Smith in short
order, but was rarely able to connect with what are
evidently pretty hard punches. Brock was taught
the real science of the game by the Old Master, and
a long spell and careful attention to his health and
condition have brought him back a really fine per-
former. Tough and determined, Tanner fought con-
tinually, but Brock punished him severely, and there
was never any doubt as to Wallis’s verdict. Tanner
would make quite a splash in a four-rounder with
another crude slogger.

Thanks to a £2OO side-wager and skilful
publicity work, Tom McAuliffe, the mystery-man from
Wagga, had the satisfaction of seeing nearly 7000
patrons of Art at the Melbourne Stadium when he
attempted to dissever Billy Grime from his light-
weight crown. It was all the satisfaction Thomas

got, for in less than

Tom has a wicked
right, but was much
too slow with it. After

thing in the champion’s
repertoire for two
rounds, he was merci-
fully put down and out

weighed 9st. 341 b. : and

The cricket season in Adelaide dragged on
till nearly the end of April. Sturt, the .leading-
club all summer, was just displaced by University
at the finish of the season proper, but won the first
“final” by a narrow margin. In the challenge round
to which ’Varsity had a right, Sturt made 275,
mostly contributed by the veterans Townsend, 73,
and Willsmore, 64, with Scott, 33, next best. Uni-
versity had to finish on off afternoons. Colin Alex-
ander went far towards winning with a beautiful
82, and the side got home by three wickets, Bayly
(who batted on three afternoons) remaining 40 not
out; sundries with 29 was the fourth-highest scorer,
and Vic. Richardson was unexpectedly the best
bowler, with 3 for 62. It is University’s first
premiership. The highest aggregate in club cricket
in Adelaide for the season goes to Ryan, with the
very moderate total of 686. On the other hand,
Williams, of Port Adelaide, though his curly de-
liveries have been superseded in the State XI by
Grimmett’s, secured 61 wickets, a total exceeded
only once —by the imported Crawford in 1912-13.
“Hotliam” : The mercurial .T. D. Scott did
not roost long on his South Australian perch. After
a season in Adelaide, “Scottie” is to flit to Melbourne,
where he will play for Northcote and presumably with
Victoria. His pace should give a much needed
variety to the Dark Blues’ attack, for a sign that
a real fast bowler is wanted has been hanging out
in the Cabbage Garden ever since Macdonald went
where the money calls.

“Harold Hardupp”: My friend Biliks,
chosen to represent the office in a picnic match, had
talked so much about his youthful cricketing days
that when I met him the day after the game 1 asked
him how he had got on. Binks didn’t seem to hear
me but Bloggs answered for him. “He didn’t do
badly; not badly at all,” said Bloggs heartily, “in
the first innings he was bowled first ball, but he very
nearly made a run in the second innings.”
* * * *
“Ex-Englishman”: G. A. Faulkner, who
came to Australia with the South African team of
1910, -and who has been writing a lot of rubbish
about Australians he has never seen, has started a
“school of cricket” just outside London. It is open
all the year round, with himself as “principal”;
the other directors are our old friend Warner,
Leveson-Gower, a former Surrey captain (it was a
disagreement with him that put J. N. Crawford out
of the county team), and Philip Trevor, who once
came here as manager of an English team and made
himself conspicuous by newspaper criticisms. Trevor
was then keen on the abolition of lefthanded batsmen.
His “reform” (one of many) was not to come into
force for 10 years, to allow Hill and Bardsley and
Ransford to work themselves out; but no new ones

were to be trained. It will be interesting to see
if he brings the principle into his directorship, or if
the years have brought him more sense.
* * * *
“Lond”: Stewart Caine, who has taken up
S. H. Pardon’s editorship of WiSDE.v’s, gives promi-
nent notice in the new number to “illegal practices”
on the field. The Marylebone Club has instructed
first-class umpires that lifting the seam of the ball
is illegal, so that point is settled. “Viewed from
any angle,” says Wisden, “the practice—happily
very rare —is indefensible.” The other point is the
one raised by Mailey, about a bowler having resin
on his fingers to get an extra spin. “From inquiries
made I found that resin had in fact been used at
various times by some of our own bowlers. If not
actually contrary to the laws, this is quite foreign
to the spirit of cricket.... There is no analogy with
sawdust, which is allowed after rain to restore the
state of the ball to the normal; resin clearly brings
about a condition that is abnormal.” But wicket-
keepers began, some 40 years ago, to put a sticky
solution on their gloves. “This has continued, I be-
lieve, without any protest. If it is allowed, then,
in fairness, resin must be also. There is danger
in both.”
“Hotham”: The inter-State cricket confer-
ence in Melbourne on May 7 promises to be a lively one,
for Victoria and N.S.W., who have been making
faces at each other across the Murray for some
time, are bent on scrap. Queensland has been granted
special representation, in view of its urgent appeal
for admission to the Sheffield Shield competition,
and will no doubt side with N.S.W. Victoria has
hitherto backed the northern State, which has only
S.A. to fear, since the present rules demand a
unanimous vote in favor of admission. Another
important matter for discussion is the pooling of
gates for Shield matches. Victoria is agin this,
while South Aus„ for once, is in agreement with
Noo South. The rule as to covering the wicket is
to be finalised one way or the other. Last season
Vic. refused to comply with it, With disastrous
results to South Aus. So there’s fuel for another
blaze.

“Number Five” (Lond.) : The training
news of the Oxford and Cambridge boatrace crews
was obscured this year by descriptions of the devas-
tation wrought in flapperdom by G. P. Bell, the
Geelong boy who rowed No. 2 in the Cambridge boat.
Belt was described as a young Adonis, and his steps
were haunted by gasping femininity. The training
runs were seriously impeded by adoring females get-
ting under the feet of the runners,' and Bell had to
be placed last in the queue, where the unpleasant-
ness of running down a fat flapper would be minimised.
It recalls the adoration lavished on golden-bearded
George Bonnor, of the early Australian elevens, by
English dames and damsels; The thing was a con-
founded nuisance to his mates, though George greatly
appreciated it. The best cure was to introduce the
adorer to the “young Greek god,” as some gushing
paper styled him. George’s only topic of conversation
was George, and the lady’s recovery was usually
speedy.
Spirited football was witnessed in the
opening round of N.S.W. Rugby League matches at
Sydney. Warned by declining “gates” that the
public was wearying of the stodgy and time-wasting
exhibitions so common last year, the League introduced
a few improvements—the “play-the-ball” rule; the
tick-out from the goal-line instead of the 25yds.
after a “force”; extra footballs on the line-out; and
a time-bell—and the changes were certainly appre-
ciated by the spectators on Saturday. The match in
which South Sydney, last year’s premiers, downed St.
George by 16 points to 12 was exciting enough
for anything. Only the brilliance of Benny Wearing
pulled South through; after the winger had scored
two tries early in the piece, South was generally
outplayed, especially its forwards. Three players
(Tye and Burns, of St. George, and Root, of South)
were sent off for infringements, mostly fistic, and
Traynor, the St. George captain, was an ambulance
case in the second half; even then the Illawarra men
did most of the attacking. With a little less bad
luck they would have won. The Western Suburbs—
Glebe game was also vigorous; the scores (West 5,
Glebe 4) were all made in the opening half. The
fine hooking of R. Lindfield was a factor in West’s
win. The League lias been short of a g'ood “rake”
since Sandy Pearce gave up the game. In the other
matches, ’Varsity upset Newtown by 23 to 12, and
the rejuvenated Eastern Suburbs trampled on Balmain
by 20 points to 9.
“Shrewsbury”: One of the most fatheaded rules of
Rugby football has at last been amended, though only
by the N.S.W. players of the League version. This
is the rule which gives a defending side, when it has
to save its bacon by “touching down” behind its
own goal line, the right to start again by a kick
out from a line 25 yards up the field. This not
only penalises the attackers who compelled the
“force,” but gives the sorely pressed enemy an
advantage which he hasn’t earned. The kick-out has
now to be taken from the goal line, or, if the
ball has been kicked “dead” by an attacker, from
half-way. The writer has long advocated giving a
point to the attacking side for a compulsory “force.”
This would do away with deliberately defensive
“forcing” and liven up the game, since players
behind the line would sooner take the risk of
clearing the ball than of losing a certain point by
“forcing.”
“Centurion”; Sydney Rugby League’s attempt to
get another lease of the Sports Ground, which it has
monopolised for years, has been frustrated. The
ground trustees were willing, but Lands Minister
Loughlin was not, and he has the last word. The
Minister can see no reason why the ground should
not be allotted on different days to other sporting
bodies. His attitude is refreshing, more especially
as there has been a strong League element in the
Labor party, and if he can free the Cricket Ground
from the winter monopoly which he has terminated in
the case of the Sports Ground, he will have a worthy
niche in the temple of amateur sport.

“Flagwagger”: Most wealthy men have
their hobbies, but that of, Tom Pavey, a Footscray
contractor, is unique. Tom runs the Kingsville team
competing in the Vic. Junior Association. He em-
ploys most of the players and pays them extra for
Saturday afternoons. And some of the Kingsvillers are
cracks. Early last season the Footscray League club
induced Cahill, a prominent Subiaco (W.A.) player,
to come to Victoria. But when he arrived he got a
job with Pavey and sported Kingsville colors. This
season he is remaining with Kingsville as coach.
Another noted footballer who played with Kingsville
for portion of last season is Alec Eason, of Geelong,
Footscray, and inter-State fame, generally reckoned
the greatest rover of all time.
* * -X- *
“Trekle” : Footballers among the Melbourne
police find it impossible to play their game. After the
police strike in 1924, the Wednesday League refused
the Police club’s application for readmission to its
ranks, and this season, though only five teams will
be playing and a bye every Saturday is certain, the
union-dominated Railways and Waterside Workers
still look on the new force with animosity and
decline to let it compete. This prohibition is thrust-
ing good cash aside. A clash between the lumpers
and the John Hops would draw a bigger crowd than
a Fitzroy and Collingwood match.
* * * *
“Shrewsbury”: The English Athletic
News, which eaters very largely for Britain’s huge
Soccer following, recently laid down its pen to
heave the inkpot at the big limited liability profes-
sional “clubs” which are the heart of the game in
the Cold Country. There is some excuse, the News
thinks, for the refusal of most of the First League
clubs to permit their players to visit Australia, since
the trip cuts into two seasons; but a proposed Cana-
dian tour during the summer has “exposed the
miserably selfish attitude of the clubs,” only four of
which are willing to lend their gladiators. There
are two sides to the question, as I remember a
Bulletin writer pointing out. “Clubs” which re-
turn fat dividends to shareholders have to watch
their stock-in-trade. A player whose purchase may
have cost £5OOO or £6OOO, apart from his weekly
wage, can no more be risked on tours of this descrip-
tion than Manfred could be allowed to go on a tour
of grass-fed meetings, in the bac-kblocks. It would
not be a business proposition, and League Soccer in
Britain nowadays is a commercial undertaking, “first,
middle and last,” as they say in Lancashire. Inci-
dentally, there were 92,000 people at Wembley when
Bolton Wanderers scored the goal that spelt defeat
for Manchester City in the Cup final. Attendances
of 92,000 are, of course, a rarity, but there is any
amount of money in the game.
• * * *
The Hawkes-Kalms match, played on the
last day of the Vic.-N.S.W. tennis tussle at Rush-
cutter Bay, was the most interesting of the series.
Kalms had previously beaten the very promising
M.L. youngster E. D. Andrews for the N.S.W.
singles* championship, and he showed better form
against the Maorilander than against the man from
Geelong. Nevertheless, he took a set from Hawkes.
The win was not sufficient to crown the Southern
State’s representatives with victory, N. S. Wales
finishing with a rubber to the good. Victoria
was unfortunate in losing the services of Wertheim
owing to an attack of gastritis. Patterson and
Hawkes won all their engagements, both singles and
doubles; Clemenger and L. E. Baker were equally
successful for N.S.W. in the singles, but crashed
dreadfully when meeting the Victorian champions in
the doubles. The Victorian ladies won their con-
test, also by a narrow margin, 6 rubbers 16 sets
to 6 rubbers 13 sets. Daphne Akhurst was again
beaten by Esna Boyd after Daphne had scored in
the first set. 8-6.

A perblicitv vote
To put Iffcoadcasters wise
On the tack they prefer to be fed on, the manna
they like from the skies.
There are market reports
For old birds, and for youth
Comic opery and sports,
Jazz music and—’struth !
Perlitical speeches, and sermons churned out by the

Well, each to his taste,
As the copybooks say.
Know wot ’d be placed
Fust favorite, eh ?
If they asked for a plain reffyrendum on what we
prefer at the Bay?
We have sermons, a train,
Concerts too, if you please,
And a film by a jane
Called Luvly Lerweese
Was a step on the pathway of progress Tong which
we advance by degrees.
But to think I should live
To see bruisers engage
In jabs at the chiv
Right here on the stage!
It shows they’ve discovered a way to make quod
a bit less like a cage.
No, I can’t say I hold
With the poet who sings—
A story he told
And hollow it rings—•
That sorrow’s piece de resistance is ’membering
happier things.
Gipsy Smith may be in
Any time—he’s a whiz
At scrapping with Sin
With his ’Vangelist biz,
I’m told—but these pugs were the real goods, and
oh, what a diff’rence there is!

THE INKY WAY.
A Hobart Mercury man, A. J. Villiers,
who made the journey to the Antarctic with
the Ross Sea whaling expedition a couple
of years ago, has made an attractive book
out of his experiences —“Whaling in the
Frozen South,” he calls it.
“C.Q.”: A Melbourne cleric covered him-
self with glory the other day. The church
fete hadn’t gone as well as a Pavlova season,
so the committee deputed him to splash some-
thing on more publicity. A list of the attrac-
tions offered duly appeared in the local rag.
It was headed “Lust Night at the Bazaar!”
“ Uramao ”: The M.L. Mercantile
Gazette has just notched its fiftieth year.
R. T. Wheeler, of Dunedin, founded it; and
though it has lengthened its name, con-
tracted it and absorbed other publications
during the half-century, it hasn’t otherwise
altered much. T. G. Russell, of Christ-
church, has been associated with it for 40
years.
“Roycha”: Even the police-court yields
its Spoonerisms. The other day I heard
a suburban magistrate remark, address-
ing a solicitor: “And you say he had a
weekraan’s worldy ticket?” Also I recall a
John Hop who, stepping briskly into the
■witness-box, began.: '“My name is John
Jones. I am a police-station constabled at
.so-and-so.” And nobody grinned except a
couple of pressmen.
The S. M. Herald had its 95th birthday
this month; it was first issued as a four-
page weekly, costing 7d., on April 18, 1831.
In 1833 it was published twice a week at
(id., and in 1837 three times a week. It
became a daily in 1840, the name being then
changed from Sydney Herald to Sydney
Morning Herald. The price was reduced
in 1857 to 4d., in 1860 to 3d., in 1868 to
2d., and it has been Id. since 1893, with one
small break in the post-war years.
“Clerk”: The shingled sirens on Vie.
Railway Commissioner Clapp’s head-office
staff run a bright little 36-page quarterly of
their own called The Whisper. It contains
a serious editorial, some short stories and
verse, gardening and household notes, and
personal items. The literary staff are their
own publishers; they run off the sheets on a
duplicating machine and fold and bind ihein
in a stiff cover. Sixpence buys the journal,
and all proceeds go to charity.
“0.P.H.”: I was on duty at a St. Pat-
rick’s Day luncheon at the Melbourne Exhi-
tion when the chief guest was “Fighting
Larry” Rentoul, wdio extolled St. Patrick
and joined in expressing the hope that Ire-
land would be granted a measure of self-
government similar to Victoria’s. So elo-
quent and so gripping was Larry that one
of the reporters doing the speech forgot his
turn and just listened, as Charles Dickens
did to O’Connell in the House of Commons.
“Oxmead”: The little word “crook,” which
is used colloquially, my dictionary informs
me, to signify “a professional rogue; a per-
son recognised by the authorities as belong-
ing to the criminal class,” seems in danger
of being overworked. A correspondent who
recently wrote a letter to the S. M. Herald
giving a spirited account of his experiences
as a country delegate to the A.L.P. con-
ference employed it 18 times. The word has
been a favorite in Labor circles ever since
N.S.W. ex-Premier Dooley stigmatised the
comrades as “uncouth crooks,” but somebody
should think out a synonym or two for it.
“Bill Bowyang”: The Australian writer
who posts his MSS. to U.S.A. and selects
likely markets from such publications as
“The Writer’s Market” (Cincinnatti) or
“1001 Places to Sell Manuscript” (Frank-
lin, Ohio) will save time and stamps by
ascertaining first of all if the publication
to which he is forwarding his literary wares
really purchases original matter. During
recent months a number of American maga-
zines have ceased to do so, the latest being
Ainslie’s, which announces that in future
it will confine itself to reprint matter, and
many other magazines use nothing else.
“N.P.”: Australians who remember the
name of Sydney de Loghe, the young Eng-
lish settler in Gippsland who went to the
war and wrote “The Straits Impregnable,”
may have forgotten that his real name is
Sydney Loch. This name has since appeared
on the covers of several books, one of which,
an honest impression of Dublin in the Blaek-
and-Tan period, wms widely read. The
author wrote it in collaboration w T ith his
wife, formerly Joyce Nankivell, long known
as an Inky Wayfarer in Melbourne. Sydney
Loch’s latest book has just been published
by Jonathan Cape. It has the liighbrow-
vampish title of “Three Predatory Women.”
“Ricardo”: I am wondering how long it
will be before the Australian papers which
ape Yankee journalism introduce the “Advice
to the Lovelorn” column. In Uncle Sam’s
country women writers like Beatrix Fairfax
and Dorothy Dix have won widespread repu-
tation as counsellors on affairs of the heart.
When an American girl is in doubt as to the
number of kisses she ought to allow the beau
who takes her home from a dance, or whether
it is strictly proper to park her corset before
a petting party, or whether 40 is too old to
marry or 16 too young for divorce, she writes
to the “Lovelorn” editress and gets an
authoritative ruling.
“Modestine”: Here’s a queer coincidence.
Almost the last bit of writing old Henry
Parkes did for the press (he died in April,
1896) was an imaginary conversation be-
tween Dr. Lang and W. 0. Wentworth,
printed in the Antipodean in 1893. Part of
it ran as follows
Wentworth: “Well, see what your Democracy has
brought us to; the rotten material they are putting-
in the Upper Chamber.”
Lang: “Are you sure Sir, you can acquit yourself
of all blame? In the repair of your model Upper
Chamber, is not the rotten material the natural
fruit of your cherished principle of Nomineeism?”
Wentworth: “I fear I was a little blind. It never
crossed my mind that the ignorant will of a truckling
Minister would be allowed to have full swing.”
Lang: “Look at the latest appointments.”
Wentworth: “I have looked at them—with disgust
and loathing. Where did they come from? The
present outlook of the country is sickly.”
Lang: “And more of your constitutional work will
have to go: your nominee Upper Chamber mmt go.
It is not die mere material only—the whole fabric
is rotten.”
Wentworth: “You know I left it in their hands.
They had five years to try the experiment. They
might have changed it of their own free will.”
Lang: “It will be changed.”

available. These new lamps combine all
the outstanding advantages of the other
types now in use, and incorporate recent
developments not to be found in any other
type. The lamp is of graceful design and
is frosted on the inside. The outside is
perfectly smooth and is as easily cleaned
as a clear lamp, yet the diffusion of light
from this new lamp is greatly superior to
that of the clear lamp, and the loss of
light due to the frosting is neglible. This
new development embodies the most out-

ten years in the art of incan-

another accomplishment attribut-
able to the research work and

“Amarilla,” Pavlova’s offering to Sydney
this week, gives the star opportunity for a
brilliant contrast with her work as the pas-
sionless “Fairy Doll” ; in the newer offering
she. is the passionate gipsy girl jilted by a
noble lover, driven by the chief of her tribe
to entertain him and his bride, struggling
with a variety of passions and emotions,
even springing to an ecstatic hope of still
holding him. From Pavlova’s entrance, re-
luctantly forced forward by the gipsy chief

who even neglects his shaving—the tragedy
of the girl’s wounded feelings moves against
a background of gaiety, through her wild
hopes, up to the moment when, thinking she
,has succeeded in winning him back, she
finds that he has arranged a secret meeting-
only to pay her off with a purse of money.
It is vivid work, although the Count, who
wears a perpetual look of idiotic beatitude,
seems hardly worth the girl’s agony. Laurent
Novikoff, who did some good work in this
as Pavlova’s brother, is again, with the star,
the biggest factor in “Walpurgis Night,” in
which a grotesque Mephistopheles (Pian-
owski) introduces a Faust (Domoslavski)
who is surely far too like an over-dressed
tailor’s dummy to command the ladies’ atten-
tion. As Pavlova is Helen, Cleopatra has,
of course, to take a back seat, which throws
things rather out of focus. Incidentally, the
view of the palace in Hades is one that
should cheer a good many members of the
audience.
* * • *
Amongst the divertissements, although
Pavlova herself does dainty work in “Cali-
fornian Poppy,” the most entertaining items
are a dashingly-delivered Polish dance by
10 members of the company, the “Buffoons”
and a dainty Grecian dance, in which the
Misses Stuart, Nicholls and Mather are
concerned. The orchestra’s “ Egmont ”
(Beethoven) overture gives to the carnival
an exceptional introduction. Conductor
Wurmser’s methods make him one of the
most interesting members of the company;
and the looks with which he slew some
late-comers on Saturday night—they may
have been Vice-regal late-comers—were
Jovian.
“Lilac Time” being due to bloom at Syd-
ney Royal next Saturday, with Harriet Ben-
net as a new flower, “White Cargo” has
sailed for new ports.

Pirie Bush has stepped into the shoes of
Paul Plunkett, who has inherited a title —
he is the Prince now in “Katja,” Reginald
Dandy having been transferred to the lead
in “Rose Marie.” With that solitary change
the Polly of the Present is the Polly of the
Past at the Criterion (Sydney).
** * *
Looking for spare seats for disappointed
latecomers remains a nightly Sydney pas-
time at the new St. James’s Theatre, where
“No, No, Nanette” is still giving much satis-
faction.
At Sydney Palace Lee White should be
able to forget any sorrows she ever had in
the warmth with which “Keep Smiling” is
greeted nightly.

Sydney’s last immediate chance of hearing
Uncle Tom tell Legree that he may own his
body, massa, but his soul belongs to God, will
happen to-morrow night. “Faddy the Next
Best Thing” makes its start at the Grand
Opera House at Saturday’s matinee.
** * *
Tal Ordell had a rough spin in his Sydney
season of “Kangaroo Flat.” The month be-
fore Easter vies with the month before
Christmas as the worst part of the theatrical
year, even the big firms being glad to get
through these periods of saving up with
small loss; and Ordell, when he went to the
Palace, hoped that the Firm would let him
have it for Easter itself. The Firm didn’t.
Now he has ventured on a week’s suburban
produption of a play by Arthur H. Adams,
“Gallipoli Bill,” which he is trying on the
dog, so to speak. Adams’s method of play-
construction seems rather artificial; but
Ordell, as Bill, draws an Australian charac-
ter distinctly and gets a lot of humor out
of the part.
The Veterans of Variety are farewelling
at Fullers’ Theatre (Sydney), leaving many
old songs unexploited, and a pleased Show-
man for once in a way hopes that the fare-
well will be a good laster. Lily Burnand’s
singing of “I’m Waiting Here for Romeo”
and “Maggie Murphy’s Home” and George
Campbell’s “The Old Kent Road” were most
acclaimed of this week's offerings. At the
other end of the programme Jim Gerald as
Admiral Pitchitoffski in “Once Aboard the
Lugger” is at his best.
Jf: * *
The ingenious Mantell’s Mannikins arc
paying a farewell call at Sydney Tivoli —
Mantell declares that over a thousand
strings have to be pulled during the enter-
tainment, and it is quite believable. Back
from musical comedy, Athol Tier, with his
likeable partner, Peggy Ross, is as grotesque
as ever in his old act, “Silly, but Soothing,”
which bears repetition; but Scott Sanders
finds it necessary to work desperately for
his laughs. In the otherwise good Rigoletto
Brotliers-Swanson Sisters act there is occa-
sionally a crude suggestiveness in the sisters’
songs which ought to be cut out. The
youngster who, of the Six Imperial Patri-
colas, takes most of the risk will probably
break his neck some day; the turn is a
whirling one, but leaves a feeling that the

main chance should be taken by one old
enough to choose what he likes to do with
his own neck. The still smaller member
of the troupe whose activity is as yet limited
to hand-springs makes a pathetic picture.
Such acts shouldn’t be encouraged.

Wirths’ .Circus, considerably strengthened
since it started its season in Sydney, con-
tinues its course at the Hippodrome. You
have hardly finished with the young lady
who has so marvellous a control over the
elephants before white-tighted arcobats are
whirling through the air or a humorous dog
is helping to keep the clowns busy. The
Wirths have been so long in the business
that they know how to time such things to
the second.

In “Lovers in Quarantine” Hoyt’s Sydney
house presents a lively comedy more or less
founded on the “Quarantine” which Lawrence
Grossmith gave us; Bebe Daniels is the
riotous tomboy who, believing the explorer-
lover really loves herself, locks up the sister
with whom he has arranged to elope, and
becomes marooned with him and her shat-
tered delusions on the ship on which the
elopement was to happen. The whirl of
reasonable fun changes to a whirl of
action when Buck Jones in “The Cowboy
and the Countess” gallops on to the screen.
The Lyceum, where harsh-voiced but ever-
popular Amy Rochelle wins applause during
the interval, has a well-staged picture in
“Confessions of a Queen,” a particularly
happily-cast and well-acted romantic. story ;
and “Memory Lane” (Haymarket and
Strand) deserves a word as a well-worked
story, marred only by a final unreal twist.

The unseen hand of Dion Boueicault —yet
not always unseen to those who occupy the
outer edge of the o.p. seats —is apparent in
the admirable performance of “The Admir-
able Crichton” at Melbourne King’s. The
Barrie fantasy depends for its appeal on
every situation having the last drop of
emotion extracted from it, and just as Bouci-
cault, when he played parts like Mr. Pim,
stretched his business almost —but never
quite—to the point of breaking, so, as pro-
ducer of this play, he makes his band pro-
long the note and play variations on over-
tones which threaten to collapse, but never
do. The piece embodies the Scotch play-
wright’s familiar trick of putting ordinary
people in situations where they do exactly
the opposite of what is expected of them,
but there is an absence, not to be deplored,
of the overflowing Barrie sentiment. First
played here over 20 years ago, the thing
remains as fresh as a memorial wreath of
artificial flowers enclosed in a glass con-
tainer. The Earl of Loam is a peer, subject,
as peers are to-day, to attacks of Liberal
or even Bolshevik heresy. Crichton, his
butler, is a Conservative all the time. He
cannot maintain his social position in the
servants’ hall unless his master is careful
of his in the drawing-room. The Earl in-
sists on his family meeting the servants
(once a month) on a basis of equality.
Crichton has no delusions about equality—
it is against the law of nature. The next
act sees the breezy aristocrat wrecked on a
tropic isle with three daughters, a useless
nephew, a parson, a lady’s maid and the
butler. Crichton never approved of equality
in England, and he does not sanction it on
a desert island. The law of nature operat-
ing, his superior talents give him the leader-
ship. But once more a law of nature oper-
ates, and the corruption that attacks all
ruling classes shows no respect for Crich-
ton. A victim of megalomania, he becomes
a king and the aristocratic crowd his ser-
vants. From amongst four adoring women
he selects, as his consort, the peer’s eldest
daughter, and the nuptials are about to be
solemnised when a ship’s gun announces an
amendment to the natural law. The last
act finds Crichton back in bis lordship’s
drawing-room, still a worshipper of his Tory
deity. He lets the Earl resume the pose of
master while himself returns to butling. His
intended wife, however, will not abandon
him for her own class without a romantic
spasm. But Crichton is proof against the
temptations of cheap sentiment. He repels
her attempt at a passionate farewell with
an obsequious bow and the hand-washings of
a perfect domestic; on which situation the
curtain artistically descends.
* * * *
Brian Aherne as the admirable Crichton
earned the adjective. The part required a
demeanor in which every gesture counted.
The rest of Boucicault’s symphonic orchestra
obeyed the producer’s baton. Mary Hinton
as the eldest daughter was adequate but a
little hard of texture; Hubert Harben was
an amusing earl; Ronald Ward a perfect
ass of a nephew; Violet Sterne a scandalous
countess. Angela Baddeley emerged from
the lord’s kitchen as a purely comic servant
but developed on the island a capacity for
primitive emotion. The lady has versatility
and humor.
* * *
The choral show of the Don Cossacks at
Melbourne Auditorium has been caviare to
the general, as well as to the lance-corporal
and the sergeant-major. So listeners haven’t
flocked there, although the show is well
worth while. Saturday night’s programme
displayed the team in some items against
which difference of language and atmosphere
erected no barrier to pure enjoyment. Local
choristers have lent an appreciative and
wondering ear to the devices of these heredi-
tary community singers. The beauty of the
falsetto voices enables the conductor to gain
the effect of a choir of members of both sexes
raised in song. This was quite remarkable
in two numbers, “At Church,” by Tschaikow-
sky, and “Evening Prayer,” by Ilwovsky,
sung with the greatest devotional feeling, in
which the voices faded away almost to a
whisper. And largely because it includes the
same striking effect, “The Volga Boat Song”
has consistently received encore honors. The
team moves onwards next week towards Bris-
bane, calling at Toowoomba on the way.
My good fren’ he go to the war and fight
for the country of which you fob him. Why
not do the Mexican way: the soldiers get the
QQt and the people the bonus—p’raps.’
Could a play with such utterances have any-
thing but an uproarious welcome on Anzac
eve? “The Bad Man,” who is Guy Bates
Post, masquerading as a Mexican bandit,
I ancho Lopez, spoke the sentiments at Mel-
bourne Royal for the first time on Saturday
night. In this r6le of dare-devil who takes
what he wants and puts a bullet through
anyone who stands in the way, G.B.P. loses
all former suggestions of stolidity, some-
times mistaken for restraint, and rolls out
the cave-man stuff to the great joy of his
audience. Leslie Victor gets lots of enjoy-
ment out of his capital study of Henry
Smith, a nosey old gentleman confined to an
invalid chair. Ashton Jarry’s dark-visaged
Pedro, Lopez’s lieutenant, is another good
study. The ladies of the cast have but little
to do. Elsie Sparks, as the injured wife
of a cowardly husband, has only to be
scared; and Cecil Haines uses some good
gestures as a pert 'miss ready to vamp even
a brigand. Eric Maxon, once a matinee
idol, now with many silver hairs, is the like-
able chap whom Lopez called “my fren’.”
#* * *
The shadow of parting is the only half-
tone on “The Sport of Kings”—and others—
at Melbourne Athenaeum. On May 8 “The
Best People” will arrive. Avery Hopwood
wrote the play, which has no serious inten-
tion. A liner is hurrying hither an all-Yank
cast, stated to be the original troupe that
presented the cheerful thing in New Yoik.

Melbourne Tivoli is drawing quite a lot
of people away from the free show provided
by the waffle maker in Swanston-street. Gau-
tier’s dogs are the attraction. The humorous
canines provide a bricklaying act which is
really funny. The seal has suspended his
imitations of human beings and in his place
the Australian Wilbur is giving apt simula-
tions of the world of animals, and the axe-
men continue their inroads on somebody’s
woodheap.

The Brahms “Spring Symphony” was the
most ambitious effort of the Melbourne Sym-
phony Orchestra at the first concert of the
Orchestral League of Victoria last week.
Zelman’s forces gave a particularly good
interpretation of the third movement. An

An autumn picture-show:—
Making the annual pudding for the Victorian
Ai lasts Society show must be great fun. The multi-
tude of cooks ls only limited by the number of
members on the roll. The result is a dish that
acks not lung ln variety. One mouthful may be
the brilliant draughtsmanship of W. B. Mclnnes
and the next the contribution of a lady who shares
. her notions concerning the hues of human flesh with
the makers of the popular nude hose,
nr • Wh S eler ’ s lively effigy in oils of M. J.
McNally is the outstanding picture. The popular
m itic and water-colorist looks like a fresh carrot full
ot juice. Next comes the alluring study of a person-
able young girl by Muntz Adams. There is a nur-
seryful of the slickly-painted and sophisticated ehil-
dien of Mclnnes, done with his usual zeal. F. R.
Thompson has made a homicidal onslaught on A. J.
Ingram and got the victim’s bays and promontories
rather mixed, but he has done better than E. Elder-
son Smith, who has put an elderly ladv together as
it her features were parts of a Meccano set. The
agitation in the shawl and hands of Vesta Carah
distract from the calm contemplation of the lady’s
pretty face, capably painted by W. B. Collins;
while F. G. Reynolds’s fine portrait of J. Howlett
Ross is marred by a too-prominent right shoulder
Amongst the oilscapes Will Rowell’s ‘‘Hot After-
noon" is easily missed, but worth returning to, for
the color-draining powers of the vampire noonday
sun are here cleverly suggested. So is the down-
pour that threatens any minute to overwhelm the
harvest field of Delafield Cook in No. 51. A. E.
Walcott and W. G. Collins have found the Sydney
atmosphere something new and strange, but Esther
Paterson is turning to the Melbourne streetscape
with a courage that promises well. E. Buekmaster
continues to paint Nature in a mood of jerky arro-
gance. His broad study of Upwey is harsh, but full of
vigor, and his “Golden City” will introduce Mel-
ourmans to a new vision of their village. In No.
J- M - llas given his timber-getters space,
.light and air to work in—a very vivid picture. Dora
Wilson has painted a dryad with a bush-fire in
her hair, and a nice view of Collins-street. There
,s a Promising snap about the drawing of “Eleanor”
Pratt > but the lady sits in vacuo; and
Portia Geach is a cubist, probably by accident.
In the sculpture J. R. Tranthim Fryer exposes
an admirably-felt Chinese head, a-nd Wallace Ander-
son has a Diana with a Parisian bob-shingle and
decided grace of body. In his sketch for a statue
of his Majesty George V. Paul Montfort has done
as well as any sculptor could be expected to do.
On the whole, the show is nearly the worst this
critic can remember seeing in his last six incarna-
tions. The exhibits number 272, and about 200 of
them are best taken at the pace a motor-funeral
travels the side streets.

From an Adelaide critic:—
The autumn show of the Society of Arts is unpre-
tentious. Local artists have been encouraged by a
modest prize to concentrate on still life ; Miss Arm-
strong wins it with a study of zinneas. Malcolm
Hilsby has found some good subjects in Europe, John
White is sound in his familiar style, and a newcomer,
Mrs. Cudmore, shows promise. A new tone is lent
to the show by the collaboration of the architects
of Adelaide. They exhibit practical plans for build-
ings, photographs of the completed structure and
dreams of structures to be. Among these last is a
fine study by Eric Dancker, showing a church blending
with a hillside —an imaginative composition that
suggests S. H. Sime.
** * *
“Wildflower,” at Adelaide Royal, is doing
big business in a short season. Marie Burke
as heroine is an acquired taste, but her
abounding vitality and her sound art
methods bring conviction steadily as the
story proceeds. An odd mixture, this cen-
tral European story translated into the
American language; but having a snappy
Immor of its own (mostly in the hands of
Charles Zoli, Barrett-Lennard, and Marie
La Varre), and with some haunting melodies.
Gropmgs after the art'3tic appear in the
curtain being allowed to fall often on an
almost empty stage. “Ivatja” is to follow.
“Ancient Prompter”: It hasn’t been men-
tioned before that Maggie Moore’s death was
the third amongst the principal players in
Thank U,” produced only a few months
ago in Melbourne. The others struck down
were Lottie Sergeant and Arthur Styan.
Also in that excellent cast was Eardley
Turner, who is just out and about again
after five weeks in an Auckland hospital fol-
lowing a serious operation.
Poverty
Point
“Hamfat”: An interfering male has
stepped in to break the partnership of Lorna
and Toots Pounds, who have been associated
on the stage since they were infants in Mel-
bourne. Even when I met them first at the
house of some patriotic Australians living
in St. John’s Wood, London, the collective
introduction “Lorna and Toots Pounds” was
considered all that was necessary. The girls
were then starring in “The Bing Boys on
Broadway,” which had a long run at the
Haymarket Theatre with George Robey as
chief comedy merchant. Lorna was in Syd-
ney not long ago (Toots meanwhile went to
America) ; and on her way back to London
the interfering male aforesaid, second officer
on the Naldera, convinced the elder girl that
the name of Mrs. Hugh Cecil Slinn was
worth bearing.
“Harold Ilardupp”: Nowadays the visitor
to Sydney usually mentions Taronga Park
Zoo amongst its outstanding attractions;
and if the figures of a juggler who has been
estimating how Sydney enjoys itself are
anyway correct, it is the best-patronised
attraction, too. His estimate is that
23,000,000 people attended theatres and
picture-shows last year (there are 11 theatres
and 147 picture-shows to divide the crowd) ;
1,500,000 paid out at the half-dozen Sydney
racecourses; 625,000 looked on at Rugby
League football; the Art Gallery attracted
219,000 people, and the Museum a mere
30,000. The Zoo’s little lot was 703.000. Of
course the ocean beaches are Sydney’s chief
amusement, but they haven’t got turnstiles
to count the crowds. Not yet.
“M.G.S.”: Melbourne is to have a new
temple. George Tallis and John Tait have
passed over the Firm’s cheque for the site
of the Argus office and several adjoining
properties in Collins-street and Flinders-lane.
An ornate picture-theatre, shops and an
arcade are to be erected. The Argus moves
its portly form to Elizabeth-street, where
its home (in 14 styles) is almost ready.
“Miro”: An instance of the educative
effect of the “pitchers” on Henare and Hori
was afforded re-
cently at Ruatorea
(M.L.), when a
local saddler was
wakened from
sleep at midnight
by a sepulchral
voice calling his
name. On opening
his door he found
a stalwart Maori,
who requested his
advice on a saddle
that needed repair.
He was awaiting
the arrival of the
saddle when two
masked natives
walked in, one
remarking, as
he presented
a double - barelled
gun in the best
Tom Mix manner,
“Up with your
hands! No noise,
or I’ll blow a hole
thro u g li you.”
Aft e r knocking
their victim uncon-
scious and annex-
ing £l3, the des-
peradoes rode off,
while the half-dead
saddler struggled
along to the police.
The Law went
post-haste to the
Whenuakura pa,
whe r e, true to
screen example,
the robbers were
fighting over the
proceeds. But at
this point Henare
and co. invariably
go to pieces, giving
in a bland and
childlike manner a
detailed account of
their gory deeds
and producing with
pride the weapons concerned, and here
they ran true to type. As the pakeha has
up to this dwelt alongside Brown Brother
with a feeling of goodwill and security, it’s
a pity to let Hollywood bust up the situa-
tion.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : The stage was a world
apart when Sir Squire Bancroft, who died the
other day, made his first appearance in
Birmingham at the age of 20. Later, in
management, he was so successful for 20
years at the Prince of Wales and Haymarket
Theatres, London, that he was able to retire
41 years ago after giving the stage both an
artistic lift and a social prestige. Thereafter
he devoted his thespian talents to charitable
work. Queen Victoria knighted him in 1897 ;
he was_ then 56. One of his sons, George, is
a distinguished lawyer who married the
daughter of another distinguished actor. Sir
John Hare.
“Avon”: Maoriland will miss Charlie
Berkeley, who has been rushing up and down
the long islands for about half a century, in
later years as advance manager for the
Firm’s touring enterprises. Sub-editors, who
don’t love advance men as a rule, made an
exception in Berkeley’s case, and he alw'ays
got the greeting of an old friend. He isn’t
dead —merely retiring to live in Sydney.
Before he joined up with the Firm—aiid
that's 41 years ago—he had a varied theatri-
experience. He ran his own show. Foley
and Berkeley, entertainers ; he played Shaks-
pearean roles under Harkins, the Yankee
tragedian, and then was with the George
Darrell c-o. in the cast of “The Mystery of
a Hansom Cab” and other mellow ones.
Also he was leading comedian in the William-
son co. that introduced “The Gaiety Girl”
to M.L. He proposes to write his reminis-
cences, and they should be worth it.
“Venables” : Touching the fact that Minnie
Everett is billed as producer of the Gilbert
and Sullivan revivals, “Flaming Youth” (B.
15/4/’26) asserts that it is.the first time a
woman has appeared in professional produc-
tions in that capacity in Australia. Though
they may not have been billed as such, we
have had a good many produceresses in past
years. There was Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis, to
begin with ; and of late Kate Howard, who
wrote “ ’Possum Paddock,” produced that
play herself. In any case, Minnie Everett had
her name on the Firm’s programmes as pro-
ducer for the Gilbert and Sullivan revivals
m 1922, and, I fancy, before that.
“C. Ockney”: Dramatic artists who find
that the play is not the thing for the public
nowadays are turning their attention to
musical comedy. There’s more money in it.
Thus Diana Wilson, whose last work on
Australian stages was in the legit, (she was
Desdemona to Oscar Asche’s Othello), is
now in _ the cast of “Kid Boots” at the Lon-
don Winter Garden. Di. is the lady doctor
who massages the chief comedian.
“Wood’s Green” (London) : After an ab-
sence of several seasons, Kubelik appeared
in early March at the Royal Albert Hall
and added interest to the occasion by includ-
ing a concerto of liis own composition—one
of six works for violin and orchestra. What-
ever enthusiasm it aroused in the audience
was in no way reflected in the judgment of
the critics. Indeed, almost all the highbrows
not only scoffed at Kubelik as a composer,
but did not hesitate to add that in striving
for laurels which are obviously not for him
lie had relaxed in his mastery of technique,
in which he was at one time without a rival.
Daisy Kennedy, also an absentee for some
time, likewise gave a recital in London the
other day. From the outset she seemed in
trouble with the E string, and altogether
seemed unable to do justice to her reputation.
“Ricardo”: What I have long suspected
has been admitted in a Queensland arbitra-
tion case. Many members of theatrical
orchestras “play by ear” —and some of the
ears need attention. According to A. J.
Davidson (representing J.C.W., Ltd., and
others) 60 per cent, of the Musicians’ Union
have passed no competent test. The union
sec. admitted that some are merely pianola-
players—girls who change the rolls. I hope
my little daughter doesn’t see this, or she'll
be claiming musician’s pay for switching
the family gramophone on and off.
“Flaming Youth” : As a rule, Her Majesty’s
is the great chocolate-eating theatre of Syd-
ney; but the audiences are taking the high
Pavlova prices out of the chocolate-sellers.
After the intervals the boys make gloomy
remarks as they carry away their too-weli-
laden trays ; and at one of the neighboring
sweetshops the girl who served me remarked
sarcastically, “Here they come —six deep at
the counter!” I was the sole representative,
of the six-deepers, and my purchase was
small. But in a way it is a compliment to
Pavlova or her press-agent; for the Sydney
flapper isn’t easily divorced from her choco-
lates.
Ant”; A memory was stirred in
a Melbourne court when a lady sued the
r^J^w! ways ® oar 4 and another defendant for
£lOOO damages and got £5OO. She was Miss
Mabel Tracy. Asked by counsel what quali-
fications she possessed to pose as a teacher of
singing, dancing and elocution, she replied :
forty-two years ago I was a Melbourne celebrity.
1 was leading- lady with Bland Holt and the late
George Rignold. I was brought out specially by
the late A. T. Dunning to play lead in “Sinbad the
Sailor.” So you see 1 have had experience.
That settled it.
“Voice Off”: “Yarra Ben’s” par. (B.
22/4/’26) concerning the original cast here
of Barrie’s “What Every Woman Knows”
requires amplification. Gaston Mervale cer-
tainly appeared on the opening night as Mr.
Venables—he also produced the show —bul-
lie took dangerously ill on the second night.
Thereafter the part was played all over Aus-
tralasia by Norman Campbell, an old Bul-
letin contributor who is now on the Mel-
bourne Herald.
“A.G.M.” (London) : Following a trial run
at the Everyman Theatre in Hampstead, the
ballad opera “Mr. Pepys.” by Clifford Bax
and Martin Shaw, has been transferred to
the West End, the cosy Royalty being well
suited to its calibre. The author and com-
poser are both native-born, and their very
definite effort to free themselves from the
tawdry musical-comedy conventiofis: of the id ay
has met with warm encouragement. Every
other musical play in London at present is
of foreign origin. If “Mr. Pepys” should
have a long run, it will be largely due to
the excellent impersonation of the name part
by Frederic Ranalow, who made a tour of
Australia with Melba 15 years ago.
MANLY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Those who remember the days when the old
Brighton plied to ‘Manly Beach’ must be astounded
at the improvements that have been made in what
was once ‘the Village.’ ” —Manly alderman at the
Diggers’ Carnival.
V hen the Brighton plugged to Manly
With its paddle-wheels a-thump,
Taking every wave that met her
With a shudder and a bump,
Then it really was a village,
As you’d readily allow ;
But there’s few would recognise it
By that artless title now.
Then the bush came down to Manly
On the hills around her set;
Fairy Bower was a bushland
Where the flowers were living yet;
RESIGNATION.
“No complaints about your bill, I hope, Mr. Barnstormer?"
“No, Madam. Merely permit me to remark how thoroughly you
must have enjoyed my stay here.”
And the coaches gay and gallant,
Six good horses for the load,
Briskly whirled along the sandy
Track of old Pittwater-road.
Broad cool shades and hot white sunlight,
Blending scents of pines and sea,
Homely ease and pleasant laughter,
Where they picnicked merrily.
Now you pay for show and glitter,
And they charge you for your breath,
All the pleasures of the Village
Have been modernised to death.
Now the mttor-cars are purring
Where the horses had their day;
There are Coney Island sideshows,
Carnival must have its say;
And the laughter—somewhat hectic—
Shows existence still is good.
But I’m glad I sampled Manly
Ere it shed its villagehood.

Auto Strop Razor the wonderful self-stropping device is
the same.
Ten seconds to strop without removing the blade or
unscrewing anything, a minute or two to shave, a few
seconds to clean the razor, and so it goes on for 40 or 50
mornings with the same blade, giving perfect shaving

Service From Waste
FROM the beginning of human life man instinctively
has endeavored to make use of the resources of nature.
Among the forces which first appealed to him was the
power represented by falling water. In the primitive stages
of his development, he crudely endeavored through the
exercise of his own muscular efforts to transform to his
service the energy thus represented.
It is far different today. Through power houses and dis-
tributing stations such as the local representatives of the
International General Electric Company have erected
throughout the world man harnesses the tremendous en-
ergy of water power to electric motors and transmits it, far
and wide, to the service and benefit of distant millions.
Deserts blossom, jungles and forests are cleared, the trea-
sures stored in the bowels of the earth are made to serve
man, transportation transforms wastes into bustling cities.
Everywhere, through the marvelous conversion of wasted
power into electric energy for thousands of uses, electricity
is making the world better and brighter. Such is the ser-
vice rendered by our local representatives.

REVOLUTION in SHAVING!
Old Way: Rubbing
Snap made with Sod*

NO SOAP! NO BRUSH!
Why the Shavex Way has come to stay
ShaveX
New Way:
Smear lightly
ever face
Is it not strange that for hundreds of
years man has been scrubbing his face
with soaps containing soda, and has never
reasoned that under such treatment the
skin may suffer? Nothing is more ugly
than a face that looks raw. Shaving
soaps are always the same old method
of shaving. They are made with soda.
But now we have discovered SHAVEX,
thi natural method, where no brush and
soaps containing soda are needed.
FREE SAMPLE!
One can shave with Shavex in half the
time, and you will get a smoother and
closer shave than you have ever had,
and shaving will become a pleasure. Your
skin will look and feel like satin, and
your face under this treatment will look
twice as young. No after lotions are
required when using Shavex, for it is a
skin food as well.

Twom: We rarely find the behavior of the
mentally sick humorous.... S.N.R.: Not as forceful
as it ought to be J.W.W.: You don’t throw any
new light on The Bulletin’s favorite topic
J.H.C. (Brisbane) : You have the knack of rough
rhyming; but you’ve got nothing to say. ...Reg 0.
C.: The second is the better; but it is merely time-
stained melodrama... .D.M.E.: Idea good; see if you
can’t cut some of the scrub out of the verse. . . .
L. : Good idea, not treated incisively enough....
Andrew G. M.: Certainly, dozens of other Australian
plays have been produced—Frank Grist alone put
on about a score, full of local blood and thunder....
A.T.L.: “Rock of Truth” needs smoothing... .D.T.0.:
“Byron” wanders too much... .Narara: There is no
such name in the Sydney directory /.. .E.G.K.:
Nothing fresh in the observation... .Jack A.: Very
uninteresting.... L.W. (Bundaberg) : Not for u 5....
Rotom: Yes, it looks bad ; but many a decent employer
lias laid himself open to that charge rather than
turn a derelict workman on the streets.... Clem
G.: John Abbott has been working in that field
for us lately.... Mary M.: “Courtship” is overdone.
... .W.D.F.: “Skinner” has a good idea beaten out
a bit too thin for our pui’pose.., .E.A.C.: “The
chief cause of sleep appears to be the exhaustion oi
potential energy in the brain cells.” We wondered
what it was in some articles that made us
drowsy.... Edward O.: No single new thing
in it... .D.T.H.: No g00d....0x: A dull de-
scription. You did not see their features
of interest Mrs. D. B.: The verse is very
p00r... .Robert S.: Thin and weak... .Helen H.:
Not quite well enough done.... G.N. (Wayville) : Has
some strength, but too many lines fall down,- and
once or twice the grammar slips H.A.W.: The
subject is important, but your contribution is too
technical in its present form... .Victoria M.: We
can’t keep this out:-
All funny things are not seen
Upon a filmy screen.
Our eat, you know he is a Tom,
And fighter very clean.
Our neighbor’s cat it’s plucky,
And believes in all things fair
And tries and tries
To pull out Tommy’s hair.
The battles rage from day to day,
The neighbor’s cat can’t rest.
Determined not to chance
No more of Tommy’s jests.
The little cat across the road
Has a friend in need,
A dog called Ebenneese
Who also is a tease,
So Tommy’s now made up his rniiid
His hallowed ground to keep,
But in his dreams he sighs
“I could manage quite a lot of cats,
But keep off Ebenneese.”
. ...F.W.N.: “Fool’s Gold” hasn’t enough grip on
life... .S.M.L.: The idea may be good, but you
don’t make out a case for it... .R.S. (Coorow) : The
point is too small, and the verse fails... .J.F.K.:
AH too mechanical... .Jaembi: A man flirted with
another’s wife and got punched. Only that and
nothing more Jay G.: A poor yarn that moves
heavily and doesn’t make us believe it’s true....
C.F.J.; A wholly improbable horror. .. .Norman F.:
The charge against Conan Doyle could hardly be
sustained, and all the rest is very tedious Eau-de:
No hope for your attempts while your ear will
allow you to rhyme “myths” with “mists” and
“thine” with “time”.... Syd S.: (Ch’eh) : A wooden
statement of a commonplace.... Louise: Rather feeble
attempt to state the obvious.... Ripponlea: A very
tender and original lament: — 1
No bones those ivory-colored teeth’ll
Grind now. Save in regions lethal!
No more the creeping pangs of hunger’ll
Tantalise you now, poor mongrel!
Ne’er more your growl, nor more your roar
Will aggravate the dog next door!
I had only, strange to say,
Renewed your license, yesterday;
And now th’ Flame of Life’s abated,
Scandalously asphyxiated!
Ah, how your ears were soft as silk!
And did they dangle in your milk?
Ah, how you loved to carry chips,
Getting blist’rs i’ th’ lips.
When you were hut a little whelp
At the butcher oft you’d yelp !
In mine fancy, now and then 111
See you sitting by your kennel.
. ...F.M. (M.L.) : Don’t care for it.... To pyx (or
Japyx, or something else): Bumpy verse of no
quality.... Juan: The sort of remarks that might be
made by any inane person on a dull day... .Josephine
A.: Weak imitation without point. The conditions
that might give it force do not exist, and the work-
manship is crude... .Gordon S.: Horrible....
A.1.C.0.; More horrible... .Audrey R.: Feeble for
such a great occasion.... N.W. (Milton) : Don’t try to
write verse while you are content with a lazy hash of
short prose barks E.M.E.: The Lion must retreat,
. ...P.O’F.: Not in our line, hut it has a hint of
cleverness. The accent in “romance” is on the second
syllable J.P.S.Mc.: Dull, ungrammatical and ill-
constructed. .. .D.E.C.: Not nearly up to the mark.
. ...P.P.P.: Weak in conception and handling....
Stan. M.: It misses... .Marjorie K.: Not enough in
the yarn Margaret M,; The rebel fowl doesn’t win
through C.G.F.: Strangely sudden and crude
G.M.C.: No use at all G.M. (Tathra) : The cocky
verse belongs to a large class and says nothing fresh.
. ...N.L.S.: Fact that your house is swept out on
Thursday is not of inter-State importance A.II.
(Manly): Rather strains the probabilities E.L.S.:
Not quite enough there... .Ernest A.: Far too slight
in theme R.C. (Lindfield): Too little in it, and
that little is too rough Stephanie J.: The matter
is thin. Also, there is no “Fall” in Australia
M. : Still too long for u 5.... Driftwood: Nearly
floated in.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
8.E.1v.: The joke is as ancient as the Piltdown
5ku11.... H.R.0.: Bribe the clubman to place his
number nines on the street pavement again.... .8.J.R.:
As shapely as a sugar-bag of live eels.... G.T.: What
is the obscure object protruding from the bottom
right-hand corner? Y.M.: The office-boy whistled
a waltz tune and “That Jazzing Craze” wriggled its
way out of the office... .Walgee: Hopeless as an
icicle in H—l P.L.: Both appear to be gazing
at the other and muttering “Heavens, what a mis-
shapen creature!” M.P.: You’ve only reached the
bush-carpentering stage yet... .H.W.M.: None but a
woman hater could depict the opposite sex like that.

BEALE'AMPICO
tyhe Perfect
The Beale Piano
The Beale Piano has reached the zenith of
its fame. After establishing a remarkable re-
putation in the land of its production it has
advanced to a world-renown.
Her Majesty the Queen, pleased with its
tone and impressed by its workmanship has
bought the Beale for Buckingham Palace.
The New South Wales Conservatorium of
Music possess nineteen Beale instruments.
Leading Educational institutions use it for
the training of their students. The Presby-
terian Ladies’ College owns twenty-three.
In thirty years over 60,000 Beale instru-
ments have been sold.
Beale Pianos gained every award at the
Franco-British Exhibition in 1908, and
they’re even better to-day.
Every important concert pianist in Australia
has spoken in the highest and most enthusi-
astic terms of the Beale Piano.
It is eminently fitted by reason of great
depth and richness of tone to meet the exact-
ing demands of the concert platform. Be-
cause of its mellowness and elegance it is
the ideal instrument for the drawing-room.
The Beale-Ampico
The Beale Piano combines with the Ampico
in the achievement of an almost-despaired-
of success in the re-enactment of greatpiano
performances. The Ampico, lacking the
powerful yet subtle co-operation of the E-tale,
would be precluded from the achievement
of its remarkable results.
But in association with the celebrated Beale,
the Ampico is granted a medium of expres-
sion commensurate with its own powers. It
moves from triumph to triumph in preserv-
ing for perpetual repetition the finest efforts
of the greatest artists. Such performance is
that of a master always at his best—of him,
himself, in very essence and presence.
As"unto the bow the cord is”; as the haft is
to the blade, so is the Beale to the Ampico
and the Ampico to the Beale the Perfect
Partnership.
Exchange your Piano
Any piano that you now own will entitle
you to an allowance in buying a Beale-
Ampico. Convenient terms can be arranged.
Descriptive literature post free on request.
The Ampico
The Ampico is not a Player-Piano. It was
developed for those who are unsatisfied by
player-pianos.
The Ampico is capable of the one great
thing exact and perfect reproduction
in technic and volume-—of the playing
of the world’s greatest pianists. So perfect
is its achievement that only a special word
—re-enactment —has been found adequate
to describe its performance.
The Ampico re-enacts with an amazing
fidelity all that mastery of interpretation
from crashing chord to shadowy pianissimo
—that distinguishes great music from mere
sound.
Hear the Ampico
—for without hearing it you cannot appreci-
ate the marvel of its performance. The
Ampico—now in association with the Beale
Piano—may be heard at our George Street
Showrooms, Sydney, or any of the Branch
addresses as below. An inexhaustible store
of melody is yours to command with a Beale-
Ampico in the home the most modern
selection beside the musical treasures of
generations.

Business, Robbery, etc.
“Mako”: Talking of women in partner-
ship with their menfolk in business, the
senior partner of one of the biggest drapery
establishments in M.L. was a woman. The
firm of Milne and iChoyce, of Auckland, was
actually the partnership of Miss Milne and
her brother-in-law; from small beginnings
the lady saw her firm grow to wealth and
prosperity, and finally administered by a
second generation of both Milnes and
Choyces.
* * * *
“Chloe”: Put it to the credit of the R.C.’s
that every penny of the £40,000 expended on
the new cathedral, St. Mary’s, at War-
wick (Q.), was spent in the State. The
rich, yellow sandstone, of fine grain and
almost gem-like lustre, is from stone quarried
at Greymere or Yangan, in the near neigh-
borhood ; the granite pillars were quarried and
wrought at Greymare; and the silky-oak and
cedars of the district have provided most of
the wood.
* * * *
“G. 8.”: There are various schemes for
importing embryo cockies, but it is another
thing to keep them at the work. Of over
70 ardent youths who came four years ago
under the Barwell scheme to my part of
S. Aus., I know of only one who is still
with his original boss. Railway-construc-
tion gangs seem to have attracted a fair
percentage of them, thereby adding to the
army of dirt-shifters whose work has .to
be paid for out of loan money.
* * * *
“Strict Veg.”: A new industry has been
discovered in Melbourne, but it is not ex-
pected that registration will be applied for.
It is the reconditioning of meat-pies. The
enterprising suburban piemaker buys up the
unused stock of city cafes, and heats them
up, “fills” them afresh and sends them on
their dyspeptic travels again. The Health
Commission takes the view that nothing can
be done to stop the practice, because it
would be impossible to prove who had sup-
plied the culinary gelignite. How often the
same pastry envelope can be made to do duty
hasn’t transpired.
“Clerk”: If “Home Town” (B. 8/4/’26)
will re-read my par. (B. 11/3/’26) he will
see that I only announced and didn’t “eulo-
gise” the introduction on the Yic. railways
of the c.o.d. system, whereby the s.-m. for a
21 p.c. consideration collects cash from
country clients for city firms. Even when
I wrote the protesting bellow of the local
storekeeper was already loud in the land.
Still, the innovation has satisfied some of
the railways’ biggest customers, and a point
in its favor from the departmental view is
that the goods must go by rail, and Clapp’s
biggest snag at present is the road vehicle.
* * * *
“Alex. Val”: Economy in signwriting is a
common virtue amongst the Scotch and
others. When a Brisbane Macdonald sold
his business to a McDonald it wasn’t sur-
prising to find the “ac” merely painted over
and a small “c” substituted. But the saving
habit was even better illustrated in a case
which occurred in Brisbane some 10 years
ago. The firm name or Robinson, Tait and
Co. was changed to R! J. Wilson, Tait and
Co. The initial “R” in Robinson was left
undisturbed, the letters “obin” painted over
and “J. Wil” inserted in lieu, and the auditor
didn’t have any complaint about extrava-
gance.
* » * *
“Moreton”: Queensland has 426 auction-
eers and 707 commission-agents (including
estate-agents and business-agents) licensed
this year. Every one of them has to find
a fidelity bond for £5OO, but a man who holds
two licenses (as auctioneer as well as com-
mission-agent) is let off with one bond.
Two agents put up the £5OO in Treasury
bonds, and one man deposited cash, on which
he is allowed Savings Bank interest; all the
others took out bonds in the State Insurance
office, for which they pay £2 14s. It is
profitable business for the insurance office,
as only four bonds have been forfeited since
the Act came into force. But the Insurance
Commissioner picks his marks; 13 appli-
cants were refused cover this year.
* * * #
“T. Square”: Sydney softgoods temples
continue to lift their heads high in air. Mark
Foys are the latest with skyscraping ambi-
tions. Their proposed additions are to cost
a quarter of a million, against the half-
million which is going into Farmer’s pre-
mises and the £400,000 which David Jones
will expend. It is a curious reflection that
the modern prosperity of these and a score
of other softgoods firms started from a cause
which was regarded at the time as a catas-
trophe. The first shop assistants’ award
caused such consternation that one big
draper sold out at practically the value of
his stock rather than face the impending
ruin. But employees’ unions produced em-
ployers’ associations, and the firms, thus -
thrown together, discovered a means of re-
moving the cut-throat competition which had
previously limited their profits.
* * * *
“John D.”: Alf Thiessen’s 30-year-old
apple orchard at Geeveston, Huon district, is
only a 34-acre patch, but it is reckoned the
most productive in Tas., if not in all Aus-
tralia. Ordinarily, it yields from 1200 to
1500 bushels to the acre, prime fruit. The
State’s average is only 200 bushels. Heavy
manuring (a ton of blood-and-bone mixture
and 7cwt. of super, to the acre every year
as a chief dose, with 2cwt. sulphate of
ammonia and 4cwt. of potash applied a little
later, and 30cwt. lime and lcwt. sulphate of
iron year about), the constant use of the hoe
and careful spraying is the Thiessen way.
And it is a paying way. Bordeaux-mixture
spray is applied twice, at different stages of
blossoming, of different strengths, and sul-
phate-of-iron spray twice. Sorts are mostly
those proved best for export; Sturmers do
best. The garden contains only one codlin-
tree, an old chap that Thiessen has often
threatened with grafting or extinction. This
season the ancient orphan produced 20
bushels for export. And Thiessen, probably
thinking of the fine Scandinavian ancestor
who toiled long hours for low wages at local
(Tas.) sawmills, and thriftily planted apple-
trees for his descendants on wet days and
by moon and starlight, confesses.that he has
not the heart to cut the old tree down.

A Domestic
Dialogue
HUSBAND: “I saw in the city papers to-day notice of
a remarkable 25 per cent, reduction in the
price of Columbia Grafonolas.”
WIFE: “Oh, Charles! What wonderful bargains
they will be now. Why, the model for
which we paid £39/10/- will only cost
£29/10/-. Well, our machine has proved
a delight to us, brightening up home life
considerably, and I think we received excel-
lent value for our money. The Columbia
Grafonola is a pretty instrument, the tone
is exquisite, and expression all that could be
desired. I must remind my friends not to
miss this chance of securing a good musical
instrument at a cheap price.”
HUSBAND: “That’s not a bad idea for you, Elsie. You
had better tell your friends to hurry up and
buy, because the reductions will only last
until present stocks are sold.”

The drawing takes place at Sydney
Town Hall on May 13, 1926.
“A.H.S.” : I have seen a threepenny-piece
with the Lord’s Prayer, decipherable under
the microscope, scratched thereon with an
ordinary pin. A Digger did it in an endeavor
to keep his mind off work in France.
A cry from the S.A. Border Watch
(6/4/’26) :
TO MY FRIENDS.
Otto Singh, Indian hawker, begs to announce to
the general public that he is not now indulging in
intoxicating liquors and he will be pleased if his
friends will assist him in his praiseworthy attempt
by not asking him to “Come and have a drink.”
“Centurion”: I fancy “Wooden Shoe” (B.
l/'4/’26) is wide when he derives “sabotage”
from the Hebrew “Sabbath,” thence linking
it up with the slow, clumsy movements sup-
posedly associated with the wearers of the
“sabot,” the heavy wooden shoe of French
workmen and peasants. Certainly saboter
is to work in clumsy, slovenly fashion. But
“sabotage” was first used by French work-
men when machinery began to creep into
skilled trades. The disgruntled man’s remedy
was to throw his sabot into the machinery
and thus cause a smash-up. The Yankees
have an equivalent—“to throw a spanner
into the machine.”
Stephen William Harvey, a Canadian now
in Melbourne, has an unusual record for a
lad of 24. He offered himself to the Great
War in 1914 at Winnipeg, but the recruiting-
sergeant told him to run home and be a
good boy. He stole a railway ride to Mon-
treal and got into the army there. He fought
at Ypres, the Somme and Vimy Bidge before
his 15th birthday, earned several medals, and
left all his teeth in France. Then he went
to Archangel with the Russian Expedition-
ary Force. The Canadian Navy, the mercan-
tile marine and the overseas shipping strike
in Australia followed. Now he is a recruit
for the Australian Navy.
Lukin, J., one of the elders of the Queens-
land Bench, is back from his travels. No-
thing he saw in the courts of other lands
hit him harder than the trials that jury-
men in New York have to put up with.
Before the wretched citizen can take his
seat in the box he is subjected to a rigid
cross-examination by counsel, who walk
about the pit of the court like raging lions.
He is badgered as to his character or its
fragments, his family and his business his-
tory, his relations (if any) with the parties
in the case, his views on prohibition or any-
thing else. Then when he has been reduced
to a pulp he may be allowed to drop into
his seat—ready to acquit the most scarlet
sinner.
“The Listening-Insect”: Australians may
soon be able to look in as well as see in if
they can afford the high price of the tele-
vision outfit, which is now regarded as a
commercial proposition in Englaud; £6O will
buy the apparatus, and application is shortly
to be made in this country for a broadcast-
ing permit to supply subscribers. The shadow
pictures of living people having actually been
transmitted, it may not be long before mov-
ing pictures are disseminated. It only needs
the phonofilra attachment and color photo-
graphy to complete the ensemble. The house-
holder will then be enabled to retire of an
evening and have his favorite opera, plus
the music, thrown on his bedroom ceiling.
But there are a lot of technical problems to
be solved before this unpleasant dream is
realised.
“Light Horse”: A cable reference to our
recent visitor Allenby reminds me of his
Ludship’s presentation portrait. After the
great knock-off someone started a movement
among the Palestine forces to present the
Field-Marshal’s portrait to his mother, sub-
scriptions being confined to officahs. I heard
nothing more but dead silence for some years
until in 1922 I received a circular reporting
gloomy news from England. A portrait to
cost £5OO had been commissioned and pre-
sented, “the artist having consented to wait
for the money.” The English committee had
been able to collect £2OO, and an Australian
body had been formed to scratch up the
balance. My heart bled at the thought of
the too-trusting artist, standing, hat in hand,
on the committee’s doorstep trying to shove
his “To balance of a/c. rd., £300,” under the
door. But, after all, these fellows, like
writers, are accustomed to that sort of thing,
so I tore up the half-written cheque.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” among the oldest
bookshops:—
In 1859 —67 years ago—l served behind the counter
of Edward Arnold, a bookseller at 56 Elizabeth-street,
Melbourne, and continued there until he sold out
and went to Maoriland at the time the Shotover
diggings broke out. Round the corner in Collins-
street East was Joseph Wilkie, musioseller, whose
manager was Robert Elvy, later of George-street,
Sydney. A speaker at the Australasian booksellers’
dinner, lately held in Sydney, was in error in saying
that E. W. Cole, George Robertson and Samuel Mullen
arrived on the same day in 1853. George Robertson
and Samuel Mullen——l knew both intimately—arrived
on the Great Britain steamship, on her first voyage
to the Antipodes,. on Nov. 20, 1852. Cole arrived
in Melbourne on Nov. 12, same year, from Cape Town,
and immediately went to the diggings. In 1864,
broken down in health and pocket, he opened a small
stall in Paddy’s Market for thei sale of second-hand
books. Later he established “The Arcade.” George
Robertson first opened his bookshop in Collins-street
East, opposite the Argus office, where he had William
Maddock and Sam Mullen as assistants. In 1859
Sam Mullen opened in Collins-street West, near the
Bank of N. S. Wales, a library on the lines of
Mudie’s, London. He imported literature from
America as well as Europe. George Robertson re-
moved from Collins-street to Elizabeth-street, io
premises which he built near the Age office, and
nearly opposite Arnold’s. George Robertson decided
upon a branch in Sydney, and sent William Maddock
as manager. He opened right opposite the Royal
Hotel. In a short time Maddock purchased the
business. After some years he gave it up and under-
took the management of Dymock’s lending branch,
under the Royal Hotel. Another pioneer of Melbourne
was H. Talman Dwight, whose store was at the top
of Bourke-street, next the Old White Hart Hotel.
Dwight had 3d., 6d., 9d. and Is. baskets on the
footpath, with a man on guard who kept up the
parrot cry “Books, books! Buy books! ”On D wight’s
death his stock of 30,000 volumes took two weeks
to sell at Edward Cohen’s auction rooms in Collins-
street. Another pioneer was Charlwood, of Bourke-
street, next the Herald passage. The manager was
Charles Muskett, a son-in-law. Muskett later opened
for himself in Bourke-street East, opposite the Theatre
Royal, and his wife had a branch shop in Brunswick-
street, Fitzrpy. There were thus many noteworthy
bookselling pioneers in Melbourne before E. W.
Cole started in 1864.

Only Dodge Cars Are Practical
in Wild Gobi
Dr. Roy Chapman Andrews, world-famous scientist, is now
conducting his fourth expedition into the Gobi Desert, in the
north of China.
The Gobi Desert is wild, sandy, rocky and roadless—almost
impassable, at many points even to camels, to say nothing
of motor-cars.
On previous trips Dr. Andrews used various well-known
makes of cars, including Dodges. This year he is using
Dodge cars exclusively— one of the most impressive tributes
ever paid an automobile .
Jh is the only car that will stand the strain,” said Dr. Andrews.
“Last year our Dodge cars covered 5,000 roadless miles, without
repairs, and at the end of the trip we sold them for more than
they cost us. Dodges are now regularly run over desert roads
from Kalgan to Urga, a distance of 700 miles. Their stamina
is positively remarkable.”

Girls! Have You Soft,
White, Attractive
Hands?
s
a
/
Miss Queenie Stanley, a beautiful
Rexona Girl of Waratah Flats, Bays-
water Road, Darlinghurst, N.S.W., who
possesses these beautiful hands, was
awarded a Diamond Ring in “The
Most Beautiful Hands in Sydney” (Com-
petition. Miss Stanley writes us as
follows: “Having been the successful
competitor in the recent
competition for ‘The Most
Beautiful Hands,’ I must
appreciate the value of
Rexona Soap for keeping
my hands attractive.”
Rexona
Soap
It’s Medicated!
What greater attraction is it pos-
sible for any girl to have than soft,
white and attractive hands? For the
hands are to the body like the index
to the book. Beautiful hands amply
pay for the care and time used in
keeping them beatftiful, and care
is all that is necessary for develop-
ing and retaining beautiful hands.
When washing the hands, any
soap wall not do; only a specially-
prepared soap which is
entirely free from alkali
and one which keeps the
hands in perfect condi-
tion should be used. Such
a soap is Rexona Soap,
so if you would have
beautiful hands, start at
once by using only
Rexona Soap daily, and
you will be delighted with
the results, for Rexona
Soap is a toilet luxury
that any lady of discrimi-
nation must appreciate.

A Midnight Sea.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE skies are ink, but seafires dart
Like scattered serpents as we part
These waterfields that to a plough
Of cleaving iron furrow now.
A midnight sea! One knows the old
Romantic years will ne’er unfold
Again the charm that lured them so,
The roving hearts of Westward-ho;
Or, southward-bound, the clippers fine
On white wings shape to cross the Line
A careful course for Williamstown,
And daily run their easting down.
But still this midnight quiet brings
Sweet stories of departed things
In echoes that return in rhyme
Like wave-beats from the shores of Time.
Red-hearted ’neath her glossy hide,
The great black liner breasts the tide;
With monster bulk, she little fears
The terrors of those timid years
When creeping hulls by chance winds found
The ports of Home or Outward Bound,
Or else a broken fabric laid
On reef or sandbank unsurveyed;
Or in some tragic fashion lay
By seaward chances “cast away”—
A pirates’ capture or the dire
Sad prey of sudden storfii or fire.
A clouded night! One’s aft-deck dream
Is haunted by such thoughts. They seem
To speak the engine’s throbbing and
Bring back a shining sea and strand
Where Cyprian sails to noisy quays
Bore precious cargoes, and the knees
Of thankful sailors bent to praise
The gracious gods of ancient days.
When Phryne, with her lips of flame
Fresh-rouged, in wanton freedom came
To greet with welcome and desire
The Dioscuri out of Tyre,
And sell her favors for the fine,
Soft, purple gown, the food and wine,
If Aphrodite please—the pay
Of some young shipman home to-day.
And in the engine’s throb again
I hear a growling voice complain
That Caesar’s food is coarse and scant;
That in the ports of far Levant
The wine was strong, the girls were fond,
Unlike these savage Saxons, blonde,
Who grudge their Latin lords the grace
Of willing lips and smiling face.
If Caesar and his Government
On empire be—Jove’s curse ! —intent,
By this colonial wharf must we
Rot till they bid our ship to sea?
Shall rainy London rudely make
Another month our hearts to ache
For sunny shores that call us home,
We luckless sailormen of Rome?
A midnight sea! I hear the oars
Of Nordic rowers by the shores
Of Anglish coasts, where muffled creep
Those preying panthers of the deep,
The Viking men. And then I catch
A bitter discourse from the hatch
Of Grenville’s ship—“ God wot he knew,
Nor cared one whit for me or you.
“ Tis death or prison for our share!
My wounded thigh! Ah, have a care!
The Spaniard grants us truce? To Hell
I hat gunner, and the Dons as well!
“Why sank he not our proud Revenge?
By God, some day I will avenge
Upon our master-gunner’s face
This shattered leg and our disgrace!
“What sayest thou? He tells us he
For love of valor sets us free,
Has ta’en our chief aboard.... Ah, then,
I die at ease... .Good friend. . . .Good den !”
A clouded night. The engine beats
In perfect metre and repeats
This tale in everlasting rhyme;
The-ways-of-men must-change-in-time, *
But-song-in-deed and-deed-in-song
Will-sound-for-aye the-world-a-long.
Though-Bells-of-Fate for-ev-er-chime,
The-ways-of-men must-change-in-time.
The lands are green, the lands are small;
Three times the waters cover all
The compass of the solid land
M here men abide. By God’s command,
From-age-to-age, from-cli me-to-clime,
The-ways-of-men will-cliange-in-time,
Oh-Son-of-Dust, with-soul-sublime,
Tliy-Bells-of-Fate for-ev-er-cliime,
The-ways-of-men must-change-in-time.

E. J. BRADY.
A Matter of a Dog.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HER name was Lena Phillips, but the
Maoris called her Hine Piripi. Her
father, whom she so seldom saw, called
her Lena. It was her joy to be called Lena
and to have her father at home. She would
sit by his knee at nights in Te Awaiti, after
tea, and he would tell her of the whales he
had helped to catch, and what a brute that
whaling master was. He was her first hatred,
the whaling master. She clenched her little
fists at the mention of his name. Slid called
him Hari Tomiana with a little spitting
sound. Her father used to laugh at her
fierceness. Her mother would nod comfort-
ably on the other side of the manuka firs,
bke was much browner than Lena, much;
and her eyes were brown, too. Lena had
eyes as blue as Riel.
Her mother was most particular about
Lena. She combed and cleaned her, and
when Lena wriggled she shook her and told
her she wasn’t like other children her
father was a white man, and all white chil-
dren were washed night and morning. He
had said so. It was his wish. After that
she relapsed ihto silence, for she had much
to do, and had not a rascal of a wood-hen
stolen the watch-chain of her lord and
master? Boil all the wood-hens —boil their
thieving heads!
The day before they left Te Awaiti Lena
had been sent to track the wood-hen. A bit
of bright tin had been left for him, and Lena
watched for his coming, hiding behind a lace-
bark-tree. He came teetering sideways, wag-
ging his impudent brown tail —such a bit of
a tail. “Cunning old waggler!” thought
Lena in her own mind; but she said not a
word. The lacebark was a big tree, and he
didn’t see her, or at least he only suspected
something Was there. He pecked at the bit
of tin, and Lena crept out and followed him.
She went parallel to him, as she didn’t want
to frighten him, but he went too fast for
legs as small as hers. He ran low to the
ground, shaking his body and making little
rumbles of sound behind the bit of tin.
She had to go back and confess that the
cunning bird had beaten her; and her mother
wailed, Maori-fashion. They went into the
bush together, in and in, catching here and
there a weka footprint. At last, by a big
rata root, her mother paused—“A fight here!
He drop it, I think.” She pointed to a
flurry of footprints in the dark, soft, leafy
loam. Then she opened her fist. Her little
daughter stared. There it was, the watch-
chain with mud in its holes and a bit of
fern flattened to it. At that moment she
admired her mother almost as much as she
did her father. A woman who could track
a wood-hen and get back a chain was a
mother to be proud of.
Her mother left when they left Te Awaiti.
It was because of her they left there. It
seemed that Dicky Barrett, who had married
a chieftainess and had a lot of mana, had
told her father that the white men who had
come in the ship called the Tory were going
to bring a lot of white men and women and
children to live in Whanganui-a-Tara, or
Port Nicholson, as her father called it. And
her father had looked long at her that night
and spoken things that made her mother cry.
He had said that in time her mother and she
must go to Port Nicholson because Lena must
not grow up a little savage. She must learn
the white man’s ways.
And in time they went. They lived at
Pito-One. Her mother was frightened of all
the white folk, and after a time she drifted
into the pah with her little daughter, and she
was quite content there. But Lena missed
her father. He came now not at all, and if she
asked her mother where he was her mother
only wailed and muttered something about
Tomiana. Tomiana was the hardest of the
whaling masters. He would not let her
father come. He kept him catching whales,
and when he complained said, “Bring the
brat back to Te Awaiti. You’ll see her some-
times then.” But her father thought she was
learning the white ways at Port Nicholson,
so he went on whaling, though with a sore
heart.
But she wasn’t learning the white ways.
She ran with the other children on the beach,
ate pipis and mussels, and even the dried
shark that her father hated so. She was
always called Hine Piripi now, never Lena
Phillips, and except for her red hair and
her blue eyes you’d never have known her
from the rest of the children on the beach.
Oh, yes i There was another thing that
marked her out, and that was Taffy. “Taf-
fee” she called him in her rich little voice.
He was a dog, a mongrel dog that her father
had brought with him from Sydney. He was
getting old now, but he never let Lena out
of his sight. He was yellow and lean, and
liis hair was off in patches. Every bare
patch meant a fight. He was death on wild
boars, but if Lena looked at him, from a
distance even, he crawled to her on his
stomach all the way. The other children
loved him too. He was in all their games,
and he ran after them into the sea.
Young as Lena was, she sensed many
things. There was trouble in the air. Even
the children brought murmurs of it.
“Puakawa was talking yesterday. He
made Te Puni very angry,” said one shock-
headed boy. “I had it from my father. My
father says that Puakawa said Te Puui did
not own this land. We all owned it, and
now the white man has bought it.”
“Te Puni is the chief. If the chief sells,
the tribe sells,” said another boy fiercely.
Why does he not order that Bitter Thistle
to go. The thing is done now.” That was
what he had heard his father say to a friend
the night before. “Wharepouri believes now
that Puakawa is right. He is sorry that he
sold Kaiwharawliara. He sits all day with
his head in his hands, and he sifaps like a
shark if anyone talks to him. I would
sooner be in Pito-One than in Kaiwliarawha-
ra. Wharepouri is young. Te Puni is old
and calm. He has not long to live. He sits
quiet, and the white men listen more to him
than to Wharepouri.”
“He is soft, Te Puni. They tell him he is
great, and he thinks they mean it.”
“They like Te Puni,” said another boy
sharply. He was the son of a whaler.
The Maoris turned on him. “Ha! Of
course! You are half pakeha.” He stamped
his foot. “Dicky Barrett is a pakeha. Your
men think enough of Dicky Barrett.”
“He married a Maori,” they told him
fiercely, “and they don’t love him so well
now. They think he is rubbing noses all
day long with the pakehas. And he cannot
be the great friend of them both.”
“He is good, Dicky Barrett. He gave me
some figs.” It was Lena who thrust her
little fiery head into their councils.
“Ha ! Ha ! Hine Piripi, you are pakeha
too,” they told her.
Lena and Taffy ranged themselves beside
the whaler’s son. “My mother says the whites
are good. She says that you would be all
eaten now but for the white men.”
“Hau ! Who would eat us?”
“Te Rauparaha.”
“Te Rauparaha!” They repeated it after
her in a stark whisper, in a chill of terror.
He was the bogey-man of their twilights.

Stop that backache!
Look to your kidneys!
WHY be a martyr to backache? Nine times
out of ten it is quite unnecessary. Back-
ache, in common with headaches, dizziness and
urinary disorder, sciatica, rheumatism, lumbago,
stone in the kidney, gravel, and dropsy, is frequently
due to weak kidney action. Don’t waste precious
time! So long as your kidneys allow impure blood to
circulate through the system, you cannot hope to get
well. Be quick to strengthen the kidney action by
using Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills; they will not fail.
When your kidneys are well again, take an occasional course of Doan’s to keep them healthy and active.
A MAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mr. W. H. Trott, “Fail-view,” Gannon Street, Tempe,
Sydney, says: “Off and on for years I suffered a good deal
from backache and kidney trouble. Sometimes my back used
to ache terribly, the pain being particularly severe when I
stooped. One day Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were recom-
mended to me, so I bought some and they worked wonders.
After taking a few doses I felt much better, so I continued
with the treatment for a few weeks, and I am glad to say
they drove the pain out of my back and made me feel
splendid. Two years have elapsed since then, and I am still
free of backache, but I keep Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills by
me, and take a dose or so whenever I feel a little off color,
and they always do me good.”
Twelve years later, Mr. Trott says: “Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills cured me of backache 14 years ago, and I am
still free from this trying complaint.”

PEOPLE
CURED OF
BACKACHE
AND KIDNEY
TROUBLE.
A WOMAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mrs. Emily Osborne, 5 Queen Street, Petesrsham, Sydney,
says: “Some years ago I had a very bad attadk of disordered
kidneys, and as a result suffered agony from backache and
rheumatic pains all over my body. I was often so bad that I
could hardly get about the house, every movement giving me
increased pain. My rest at night was very disturbed, as it was
impossible for me to lie in one position for any length of time,
owing to the nagging pain in my back. My ankles and arms
swelled a good deal, and were very painful if I touched them.
I had no energy for anything, and wasl really far from well.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were recommended to me and
after taking a course of these grand Pills, I was completely
cured.”
Ten years later, Mrs. Osborne says: “Ten years have
elapsed since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me, and I
am still well, a fact that speaks volumes for this splendid
remedy.”

“Te Rauparalia will come, and his teeth are
longer than a shark’s and sharper than a
pipi-shell.” How often had they heard that!
He was the last resource of every mother in
the four pahs. And, what was more, Te
Rauparaha liked little girls and boys better
than big men —to eat, that was. And so that
whisper was so faint that it fell like a leaf
through the air.
Next day they were at it again. A white
man had accused a Maori of robbing him of an
axe. Well, now, what harm was there in
that? In the pah everything belonged to
everybody else, and no man wanted a thing
all to himself. It was hard to understand
the white men. The white man would have
had the Maori shut up for taking that axe,
but another white man stopped him, a kind
white man who listened to the Maoris. True,
other white men sneered and said he was
jiaid to do it, but nevertheless he was kind.
Things grew worse and worse. Lena often
had to play alone, and Taffy, the dog of all
the world, was stoned. “Pakeha dog!
Pakeha dog!” the little boys screamed and
threw stones at it.
Taffy was afraid to stir from the side of
Lena’s mother. And in the midst of it her
father came. lie stole in one night, and her
mother talked to him long and earnestly,
crying all the while. He seemed very angry
with them for being in the pah, and strangely
enough her mother now wanted to leave the
pah. They decided to go and live some-
where on the beach at Port Nicholson.
Her father went into the little town the
next day. He had cut his beard off, and
Lena scarcely knew him. He came back in
despair. No place to be got in the town!
Her mother seemed frightened this time. She
was always looking round corners to see if
someone was coming. Then there was a
shouting and screeching on the shore. Taffy
was being stoned, but it was by men this
time. Her father rushed out and knocked
a Maori over. There was a terrible uproar
of men fighting, and someone came along
and took her father away.
Her mother cried all that night, and Lena
at last got from her that he was taken away
by the kind man that listened to the Maoris,
and he would be shut up, and the whaling-
master would catch him again and punish
him.
“Is he running away from Tomiana?”
asked Lena, staring. Tomiana was more
terrifying to her than Te Rauparaha.
Next morning they went into the town.
Her mother was still crying all the way.
She did not know what to do.
Lena stared hard at the harbor. There
were one or two ships in port. One was a
brig from Sydney. The other was a schooner
from Valparaiso. Another lay closer in. It
was a Government ship, called the Chelydra,
but as Lena couldn’t read she knew none of
these things. She knew only that there
were two ships far out and one close in.
Along the beach people were gathered to-
gether in little knots, talking in whispers.
Some were pointing to the ship and others
to some writing on a poster. They all seemed
very angry. Their heads wagged fiercely.
Down the sidepath from the ship came a
few men. In the centre of them walked a
man. He looked ill, and his shoulders
seemed too heavy for his body. As he passed
one of the men on the beach muttered fiercely
“Captain Crimp.” But it was Governor
Hobson.
“Who is he?” said Lena to her mother.
“He the Queen’s man, the boss of this
country. They very angry here. He take
away their men who work. No work here.
Plenty work Auckland. The men glad to
go, but the bosses very hot. They say the
men promise to stay with them when they
bring them out. They hate that man, any-
way. They always quarrelling. Doing no-
thing right to each other.” So much gossip
had she picked up from her husband before
his capture. She thought Lena was nearly
as clever as her father, so she told it to her
as she would to an old woman.
The child sped after the retreating figures.
Her mother gave a gasp of terror and fol-
lowed.
Lena soon caught up with them. She went
in a sideways flight to the sickly-looking
man,
“Please, you are the Queen’s man, and
the boss?”
They all stopped in amazement. She wore
a Maori mat, but her hair was bright red
and her eyes were bright blue.
“Run away!” said one of the men.
“Quietly!” said the man in the centre.
“It is a petition.”
They were entering a building bigger than
the others on the sidewalk. The child went
with them blithely. Her mother stretched
her hands out after her. She cried to her in
Maori. She wrung her hands, but she was
afraid to enter the pakeha’s house, so the
child went on alone.
They entered a room at the side, the child
pattering at their heels. In answer to a
quiet sign the other men withdrew. And
there was left the red-haired child and the
pale-faced man.
“Now,” he said, sitting down as if a chair
was the thing of all that he’d been longing
for.
“It is Taffy,” she said shyly. “My father
is pakeha. He catches whales for Tomiana,
but Tomiana is a bad man,” her brows
frowned fiercely. “My father ran away. The
Maoris were kind at first, but now they hate
Taffy, and they are cross with the pakehas
for something. My father threw a man down
and they shut him up. The man was kicking
Taffy. And, please, if you are the Queen’s
man, make them let my father out. He will
be good. And make them stop hurting
Taffy.”
There was a Maori word here and there,
but he got her meaning.
He leaned his head on his hand. Was he
going to say that her father must stay shut
up? There was a knock at the door. “Come
in,” he called fretfully. And Lena’s heart
stood still with terror. In his proudest kahu,
old and stately, a Maori chief!
The child cowered back and back till she
stood against the wall with her wide eyes
on his calm, sad face.
“Te Puni!” It was only a sigh, but Te
Puni lieai'd it. He stared at the strange little
figure, but he went on with his ceremonials.
The white man and lie were evidently on
good terms.
It was another white man who had en-
tered with Te Puni who pointed to Lena
and asked a brief question.
“She’s your business, Halswell, not mine,”
said Hobson. “You were appointed to pro-
tect the natives. This child is the daughter
of a whaler. The Maoris are stirred up over
something. They have beaten her dog.”
“I remember. The father is runaway. He
got into trouble last night at Pito-One. I
can’t have the natives injured by runaway
whalers.”
“They were beating my dog!” The child
clenched her little fists. “He saw them beat-
ing my dog.”
“It is because these quarrels cause such
trouble that her father must remain locked
up,” said Halswell firmly.
“Must?” The other man’s voice w r as
quiet, but something in it made the younger
man go red.
“Of course, Excellency, if it is your wish
that he be released”
“It is my wish.” said Hobson. He turned
to the child with his slow smile. “I can
save your father, but I cannot save your
dog, and that is bad, for I, too, love dogs,
though I am a man of the sea. God send
that some day I go back to the sea!” His
voice was full of sorrow.
He looked at the little figure by the wall.
“Perhaps Mr. Halswell may not think it
unworthy of his office to protect a dog?”
The Protector of Aborigines opened his
firm lips, but there was no time given him.
Te Puni strode forward. The feather on
his brow trembled fiercely.
“My child.” he said in Maori, “thy mother
is of my people. I am not the chief my
father was. My maria is slipping from me.
Rut who shall say of Te Puni that his tribe
flouted his spoken word? Te Puni is old.
Te Puni is broken, but Te Puni has power
still to save a dog from death. Thy dog
shall go free, and Barrett shall see to it
that thy father escapes to Sydney and you
with him. Now, who has done more for thee,
thy father’s chief or thy mother’s?”
She said “Thank you,” in two tongues
very softly and slipped out of the door.
EILEEN DUGGAN.
With Wisdom.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LAST night said Wisdom’s self to me,
“Why toss and trouble so?
Come, boot yourself and robe yourself,
And we’ll a-roving go."
I rose, and said, “To-morrow’s dues
To-morrow’s thought shall be’’;
And robed myself and shod myself,
And whistled merrily.
Forgetting age, forgetting all
Care’s wrinkles on my brow,
Right noble company it was
To walk with him, I vow.
We took that old, familiar road
(How straight it stretched and clear!)
Whose every yard a minnte is
And every league a year.
With pilgrim-pack in pilgrim wise
I’ve roamed o’er rock and range;
And yet that road I trod (’tis true!),
Though old, seemed new and strange.
I am not over-young, alas!
Nor over-old, I trust;
And yet the dust about my feet
Was like no other dust.
I am not eagle-eyed, nor yet
Rat-blind, but lying there
I saw the prints of many feet—
All feet that are and were.
And some huge-booted men had been,
Great captains long asleep:
Within the dust their footprints lay
Clean-cut and ankle-deep.
This path a Caesar sure had ta’en,
And that some cavalier—
What weight of armor bore them down
To make their tracks so clear?
And here had silken slippers pressed,
And here went shoes a-dance —
Why was it that I paused to dream
Of roses and Romance?
And then, as though o’er all was thrown
A charm, a potent spell,
Mist-built, it seemed, and wind-destroyed,
Walled cities rose and fell.
Tall towers and temples came and went;
Gold domes and statues shone;
Now, was yon city Nineveh,
And yonder Babylon?
Mind-dazed, I .turned to Wisdom then
And faltered, “Tell me true
What road is this?’’ And Wisdom said,
“Look you!” I looked and knew.
Beside the road its maker stood.
Its builder grey with grime;
We waved our hands, and to him cried —
“Good morrow% Master Time!’’
He smiled, yet underneath his smile
A sourness seemed to lurk;
“Good morrow, sirs,” he said, and then
He bent him to his work.
Whereat said Wisdom unto me,
His head held high in air,
“For man or maid, or beast or bird,
Time hath no time to spare.”
Said Wisdom: “Walk what gait you please,
Chant loud or loiter dumb.
To death and dust, footprint or nought,
When God wills thou shalt come.”
Then on and on, and stride for stride,
Adown that road we went;
And, oh, the lark! and, oh, the rose!
And, oh, the morning scent!
