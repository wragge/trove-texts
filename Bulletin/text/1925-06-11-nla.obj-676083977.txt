The Lost Books of Livy
So far we have heard no more of the dis-
covery of the lost books of the great Roman
historian announced by Dr. Mario di Mar-
tino-Fusco on August 5 last, and described
as a “ sensazionalc scoperta.’l Must eager
scholars Surrender the hope of being able
to read tlie complete text, composed of 142
books, of which a mere fragment has so far
reached this age—the first 10 and the 25
from book 21 to book 46 ? These 35 books
have preserved the semi-fabulous story of
the origin of the eternal city and the history
of the epoch which extends from the second
Runic war to the defeat of Perseus. The
books which dealt with tlie civil wars of
Rome from the Gracchi to the times of Augus-
tus are lost, and they were undoubtedly the
most important from the historical and bio-
graphical points of view. They contained
the history of the generations over which
towered the great figure of “the mightiest
Julius,” being the story of Livy’s own times.
The historian’s sympathies were obviously
aristocratic, and, according to the modern
standards, he was not a reliable historian.
Although not devoid of the critical spirit, lie
allowed his work to be influenced by his own
prepossessions and temperament, and was
quite candid about it. He did not possess
historical imagination, and he frequently
transferred the ideas of his own times into
the earlier ages. He put into the mouths
of the personages of his history what he
thought they said or ought to have said. He
is indeed more of a poet and a dramatist
than a scientific chronicler endowed with
the critical mind. He was an enthusiastic
patriot, moralist and artist whose aim was
to bring home to the men of his generation
the preeiousness of the legacy on which they
had entered. In this way he is nearer akin to
his own compati’iot Virgil, and to our Shaks-
peare, the greatest historian of them all,
than to such precise scientists as. Mommsen,
Niebuhr and James Harvey Robinson.
Titus Livy was neither a professional poli-
tician nor an academic student. He was a
rich and leisured aristocrat who had studied
deeply in philosophy and had lived at Rome
in the inner circle of Augustus without tak-
ing any active part in politics. He wrote
liis great work under the eyes of the em-
peror who had appointed him the tutor of
Claudius, the future wearer of the purple.
Like the poetry of Virgil, his history was
national propaganda' of the best type. It
was the literary expression of the deep reli-
gious, traditionalist and aristocratic spirit
which inspired the last generation of the
men of the civil wars. Paradoxical as it
may sepm in the light of the oi’igin of his
nower, Augustus himself was tlie outstanding-
incarnation of that spirit. Although Livy
must have regarded Julius Caesar as a traitor
to his class and a monster of ambition, the
qnti-Caesamm of the historian was not a
personal reaction entirely, but the expression
of a deep current with which the most en-
lightened of his contemporaries sympathised
keenly. In this stream of feeling Augustus
Himself was carried along, though lie was
the adopted son of the great revolutionary.
Caesar had virtually destroyed the old Roman
aristocracy, and then found himself unable
to govern so great an empire without one.
In more recent years Napoleon I. and Lenin
Have discovered themselves in a similar
dilemma, and have set about creating a new
privileged class. The shrewd Qctavianus
soon perceived that, since be could only
govern tlie empire through an aristocracy,
lie must become reconciled to its remnants.
Livy saw in Julius Csesar the destroyer of
the ancient Roman patrician order. He re-
corded this nobility as tlie only class capable
iff preserving lex and imperium in the mighty
Roman State, and he bore Caesar a deep
grudge, the justification of which was
afforded by the later history of the empire
which Livy could not foresee. Tlie whole
story of the Augustan family in power is
fiat a despairing effort to-govern and admin-
ister an immense dominion without an ad-
equate personnel, trained and educated for
the purpose, and with an age-long tradition
<>f service behind it.
We know by indirect evidence that the
part of Livy’s history which we lack was
written in a spirit of avowed hostility to
the great Julius. Seneca tells us that Livy
discusses “whether it would have been better
for the commonweal for Caesar to have been
born or not to have been born.” He did not
bide liis ardent sympathy with Brutus and
Cassius ; and that Augustus was pleased at
times to poke fun at him by calling him
“the Pompeian.” All subsequent classical
historians who have attempted the story of
Julius Caesar show traces of Livy’s influ-
ence. All of them arc cold and sometimes
hostile to the great dictator. In their works
there is none of that unrestrained admiration
Which the nineteenth century lavished in the
hero-worship of the little man who crossed
the Rubicon and wrote tlie strangely imper-
sonal yet egotistic commentaries. They were
too close to his contemporary reputation to
be blinded by the aura of the nebulous glorv
which has since gathered round liis bald
bead. Nearly all the modern swashbucklers
and commerors who could read —from Charles
Y. and bis admirer, the Sultan Suleiman, to
tlie pitiable poseur Napoleon 111.-—have pro-
fessed unbounded admiration. His commen-
taries have become a textbook for tyrants
and upstarts who from time to time" have
shut the gates of mercy on' mankind. Shaks ;
peare’s ironic picture of Julius as a piece of
' -tin. weak, boastful and vacillating senility
on the eve of liis assassination may be Avery
near the truth about the man who'was sen -
sual enough in advanced middle-age to dally
with tlie lustful flapper Cleopatra when the
business of Rome urgently needed his atten-
tion.
If tlie subsoil of Dr. Mario di Martino-
Fusco’s house at Naples had indeed
furnished tho world with the lost books
containing the story of Julius Caesar
and the civil wars, Mr. 11. G. Wells
might at last have received some his*
torical support for his condemnation of
the conqueror, published in the “Outline
of History.” as “a dissolute and extravagant
“oung man—the associate of the reprobate
Clodins and the conspirator Catiline....
there is nothing in his political career to
suggest any aim higher or remoter than his
advancement to power and all the personal
glory and indulgence that power makes pos-
sible.” In modern Italy the Faseisti, who
have taken Caesar under their protection as
the classical vindication of their own parti-
cular brand of violence, would not hesitate
to declare Livy a “ rinunciatorio ” and an
“antinazionale .” The anti-Csesarism of the
Roman historian is, however, the key to the
first century of the Roman Empire. Through
its misunderstanding of this, the seventeenth
century of our era completely falsified the
most brilliant period of Rome, and failed
to understand one of the profoundest lessons
of wist ;.n which come down to us as a'
legacy of Rome. What is this lesson be-
queathed to us in the pages of Livy? It is
not hard to guess the burden of the message
contained in the lost books. In the words
of Guglielmo Ferrero he would say: “Take,
care, Europeans of the twentieth century !
Beware of a little river! It is easy to cross
it, but when it is once crossed there is no
means of getting back—-you must go on to
the end. It is called the Rubicon.”
FRANCIS JACKSON.
Newman
The glory of Bloomsbury-square has de-
parted. Nowadays the fine old homes, rich
in oak panelling, are the abodes of lodging-
house-keepers . and their paying (or other-
wise) guests. Fashion long ago packed up
its furniture and went westward. But in
the early years of the nineteenth century
it was, if not the residential area of the
beau monde, yet a quite “select” locality
where the upper stratum of the middle-class
of old England lived in spacious comfort.
The mossy garden was the playground of the
youth and the resort of the nurses from the
surrounding homes. There two small boys
romped together. “The younger, whose head
was profuse with long black glossy ringlets,
was a child of a rare Jewish type of beauty,
and full of life and activity. The other was
grave of demeanor, wore his hair close-cut,
and walked and talked and moved in a way
which in young people is called old-
fashioned.” The elder -was John Henry
Newmap. destined to become a cardinal of
his church; the younger Benjamin Disraeli,
whom fortune and his own genius were to
raise- to the peerage of England. Two types
very diverse, both in temperament and mode
of thought, yet having in common, though
each in a different way, a love of letters, and
both defending the citadel of tradition and
time-hallowed institutions against religious
and social disintegration.
In a biographical and literary study. Car-
dinal "Newman , by Bertram Newman (Bell),
the author, who. notwithstanding the iden-
tity of surname,- is not related to the subject
of his work, confines himself, so far 4 as, pos-
sible, to the literary side of Newman’s life.
It is from this point of view he regards the
influence of the Oxford movement, founded
by Keble and nurtured by Pusey, upon the
life of Newman and his associates. None
of the Tractarians of the ’thirties regarded
themselves seriously as literary forces, their
motive being purely doctrinal: nevertheless
the movement called for adequate expression
and a fitting instrument. This was found
in Newman. He had at that time no more
than an ordinary acquaintance with litera-
ture, and his classical attainments do not
appear to have been anything out of the
common. His favorite classic writer was
Virgil: he refers to the poet’s “single words
and phrases, his pathetic half-lines,” as “giv
ing utterance, as the voice of Nature herself,
to. that pain and weariness yet hope of better
things, which is the experience of her child-
ren in every age.” It is interesting -to'place
by the side of this Virgilian appreciation his
own confession of faith given in the
“Apologia” :
Starting, then, with the being of a God (which,
I have said, is as certain to me as the certainty
of my own existence, though when I try to put the
grounds of that certainty into logical 'shape I find
a difficulty in doing so in mood and figure to my
satisfaction), I look out of myself, into the. world
of men, and there I see a sight which fills me with
unspeakable distress. The world seems simply to give
the lie to that great truth, of which iny own being
is so full; and the effect upon me is, in consequence,
as a matter of necessity, as confusing as if it denied
that I am, in existence myself. If I looked into a
mirror, and did not see my face, I should have
the sort of feeling which actually comes upon me
when I look into this living, busy world, and see
no reflection of its Oeator. . . . Were it not for, this
voice, speaking so clearly in my conscience and
my heart. I should be an atheist, or a pantheist, or
a polytheist, when I looked into the world. I am
speaking for myself only; and I am far from denying
the real force of the arguments in proof of a God,
drawn from the general facts of human society; but
these do not warm me or enlighten me;, they do
not take away the winter of my desolation, or make
the buds, unfold, and the leaves grow within me,
and my moral being rejoice.
The author only briefly sketches the events
leading up to the memorable day when
Newman joined the Church of Rome, taking .
with him—on the authority of Lord Hough-
ton—“3o clergy and twice as many lay-
men.” Whether, regarded as a. great ecclesi-
astic. a spiritual force in Christianity or,
on the other hand, “an impossible prophet
of ‘them that look behind,’ one who by sheer
fascination of style lured men back to out-
worn and chimerical ideals,” there can be-
no doubt of the impress, he made upon the
spiritual and intellectual life of bis time.
And this not by forces of such masterly-char-
acter and dominating gifts as endowed that,
other outstanding figure of the Church of
his day, Cardinal Manning, but, by a cer-
tain simplicity of faith, deep and enduring,
and such a charity as had Francis of Assisi:
a human pity and appeal that touched the
hearts of men. Where Manning held respect
the other drew men by affection.
Newman did not. when he wrote, set out
with any literary intention. Much of bis
written matter —and it was largely contro-
versial—had but a passing interest. , Yet
lie could display an imaginative capacity
-and an aptness of phrase that lifted him
high. His style was free from mannerism
and unforced, never failing in lucidity and

in beauty of cadence. Apart from such
polemical works as the 11 Apologia pro Ut
gua” and the “Grammar of Assent, a sheat
of historical sketches, critical and dmput- -
tious essays, and many volumes of s ® rm ° ns ’
the purely literary work of Newman was
embodied in “Verses on Various Occasions
“The Dream of Gerontius, a poem; boss
and Gain” and “Callista,” prose nar-
ratives. Of this relatively small out-
put of imaginative work, the one of
outstanding merit and most widely
is “The Dream of Gerontius. The poem is
a dialogue, and, “though touched with the
indefinable quality of poetry, is singularly
unadorned, and recalls his prose in its pre-
cision, restraint and melody. Act it holds
passages which, by their vividness of presen-
tation, dwell in the mind.

man may find on the shelves ot tlic libiaiy
there is a chink in human souls into winch,
he tliev the souls that give allegiance to
Rome or the souls of Anglicanism, 1 reshy-
terianism and the many other isms ot the
Protestant faith, the voice of the dead priest
will enter. Once in the early days of man-
hood he was cabined on a vessel becalmed in
the Straits of Bonifacio. There to the lap-
ping of the sea waves, with the free sunlit
canopy of Heaven above, Newman wrote a
hvmn, a hvmn that somehow caught up the
great, longing in the heart of. humanity-
brooding over the mystery of life and seek-
ing light. It may he that some day the greater
body of men will remember Kipling because
the Recessional rings down the avenue of
time through church, chapel and conventicle.
Certainly Newman will never die so long
as the strains of “Lead, Kindly Light unit
into the world through the opened doors and
windows of the churches.
T. B. C.
The Worthless Writer
Ono Red Page contributor lias been insis-
tent upon his dislike for books. Books, like
morality, are among those things we are
taught to revere, and it seems quaint for a
man openly to admit to this dislike, it is
not proper and it makes us suspect him of
being an ignorant and base fellow. let
there are many who feel very similarly.
Books, to most’ people, were things imposed
upon them in their childhood, and their
emancipation from parent and schoolmaster
marked their complete deliverance from a
thrall. They never thought about them when
they did read them, and now they do not
read them and have no thoughts about them
either. They have only this prejudice-
books are to be honored, respected and
revered.
A similar prejudice has grown up around
the writer. The average person would never
think of writing a book, but he thinks it a
worthy deed to do, and would hasten to
accomplish it if assured of success. The Red
Page, requiring less sustained effoi’t, is
aspired to by a much larger group, and
though the Page is small and has very, few
equivalents in journalism, it is. surprising
how manv have achieved publication. With-
out exception they talk of it, they, tell each
chance acquaintance about it, they are proud
of it. they live in the constant consciousness
of their noble accomplishment. When we
step a rung lower on the ladder and come to
jingle, another •'! or 4 per cent, of the popu-
lation is added to the circle of writers. All
over Australia, in all sorts of occupations,
are to be found people who have written
jingle, and will, on the slightest provocation,
produce well-worn clippings and read them
to the sufficiently long-suffering. The jinglist
is closely akin to the paragraphist, and it
we include these last in the category of
writers we have, at a conservative estimate,
a good 20 per cent, of the adolescent and post-
adolescent nopulation.
And all these people feel nobler for having
placed their scribblings on paper. They
feel more worthy for having had those scrib-
blings published. It is so with all of us.
When travelling I carry my clippings with
me in case I meet someone on whom I can
safely inflict them. I often present my
business card and say, “Perhaps you are
familiar with the name,” in. the hope that
the recipient will ask a leading question so
that I may expand my chest and make rny
journalistic glory known. I 'meet other
writers and I find it true of them all. They
are all proud, self-satisfied, even puffed-up
over their achievements. Whether the
emanation has been a book, or such admir-
able essays as I write, or the lilting jingle of
a million other writers, or the commonplace
“nar” makes no difference. All are con-
sumed with a diabolical pride. . And.. the
strange thing is we “get away with it,” as
the vulgarly expressive American would say.
People really are impressed. Our opinions
arc accepted as authority, our presence is
revered as sacred, and as we move onward
our paths are cleared by the grovelling multi-
tude. Dropping the hyperbole and becoming
specific, it is literally true that I have won
many an argument by stating that I am
Lester Way—“ You know... .Red Page of
The Bulletin.” The times this doesn’t
work are the times when my opponent has
himself written a story, or a few lines of
verse, or a paragraph about the inhabitants
of the Barrier Reef. Many a carefully con-
structed illogical argument has been wrecked
because of this flaw in my scheme. Writers
are so damned plentiful.
But why should I be proud that I am
a writer, and why should the general public
respect me on that account? My conceit,
of course, is part of me and needs no expla-
nation, and I suppose the pride of other
writers springs from their lack of any sense
of proportion, and the imbecile public’s lau-
dations. But why should the public laud
the writer? The motor-mechanic, the car-
penter, the farmer or the navigator is more
worthy of praise than the writer. The man
who writes for a living is, at the best, wast-
ing his own life; and at the worst he is
helping millions to waste theirs —often caus-
ing strife and discord, propagating fraud and
inspiring scandal, blinding the alert and dis-
couraging the brave, asserting the false, dis-
guising the true, and clothing beauty in the
tinsel of perversity.
While I write my very true and very
clever articles about women, others are mak-
ing love to. and winning, them. While I
write about Nietzsche's philosophy, more
active men are applying the worst of it. to
my decided chagrin. While I write stories
of achievement, the young and ambitious are
achieving. Writing is the dream-life of the
weakling and the coward—the escape ot him
who is afraid to face life; the hypocrisy ot
the failure w T hom life has beaten, Jstcele

glorified the bush that he had been unable
to endure. Masefield lives in foggy London
but writes about the sea; yet he does not
return to the sea. He knows how hard a
life that is. The scenes which O. Henry
fled are the scenes of many of his wittiest
stories. . „
But what of the really great writers ?
What of the inevitable Shakspeare? It seems
generally supposed that the world would
suddenly fall to pieces if we "were to find
that Shakspcare's plays had never been
written, but were things we had all dreamed
about at the same time; just as it is sup-
posed that the world would all go bad and
start murdering itself if we found out the
same thing about the Bible. But it is only
a very small proportion of the people who
read the great writers, and those few are
not people who count much. They do not
determine the destiny of the nations nor the
mind of the multitude nor even the latest
fashions. I cannot sec how these great
writers are accomplishing anything towards
the preservation of the race or of morality.
Personally, I like reading them; but, then,_l
am a writer and am naturally prejudiced in
favor of worthlessness.
But I am trying to break myself of this
bad habit. Like drink, it takes too much of
one’s time from one’s business: so I have
solemnly pledged myself to total abstinence.
I therefore beg eager controversialists to
leave this article unchallenged lest I again
yield to temptation.
LESTER WAY.
The Windeyers
The admission of Mr. W. J. V. Windeyer
to the Bar of N. S. Wales was made the
occasion for references to this historical
legal family. In England professional tra-
dition often runs back for a century.
There are families, such as the Pollocks,
whose names are knit into the legal history
of their country. We are too young a com-
munity to boast of many such, but at least
we possess one or two. The latest repre-
sentative of the legal house of Windeyer
is of its fifth generation.
Not only the Bar but the press can claim
association with the Windeyers. Charles,
the founder of the Australian branch of the
family, was 48 years of age when he came
to our then young colony, bringing with him
a wife and large family, lie had been a
press reporter in London, and, it is said,
was the first shorthand-writer “who had the
courage to rest his notebook on the bar of
the House of Lords.” An old newspaper
record tells how the presence of the press
was recognised in the House of Lords
through an incident in which Charles Win-
deyer was one of the participants. Eldon,
who was then Lord Chancellor, had been
an opponent of verbatim reporting in the
House. One day, when proceeding to the
bar where a deputation was awaiting him,
his robe caught the notebook of the venture-
some pressman and scattered its contents.
The Chancellor stooped and picked up the
sheets scrawled with shorthand characters,
“and with a smile courteously returned them
to Mr. Windeyer, knowing full 'well what'
were their contents.” From that time on
the press little by little built up its now-
vested right to report the proceedings of
Parliament. The difficulties under which
reporters labored in those days, with no
conveniences supplied them, and writing a
primitive and cumbrous system of steno-
graphy, is graphically told by Charles
Dickens, who was himself a reporter in the
Houses some three years later. “I have,”
he said, “worn my knees by writing on them
on the old back row of the old gallery of
the old House of Commons; and I have worn
my feet by standing to write in a preposter-
ous pen in the old House of Lords, where
we used to be huddled together like so many
sheep—kept in waiting, say. until the wool-
sack might want re-stuffing.”
It was little to be wondered at that, even
with the years of maturity to handicap him
for a venture so essentially one for youth,
Charles Windeyer gathered his clutch to-
gether and crossed the seas to this distant
land. He was an optimist in spirit, and
bore the evidence of it in his fresh com-
plexion, bright blue eyes and cheery manner.
It was his original intention to become a
grazier or farmer: but even in those
days going on the land meant at least some
capital, and a large family was not then
the asset it is to-day in dairying districts.
So he accepted the small but sure post of
chief clerk of the police. He had not long
to w T ait advancement, for Governor Dar-
ling, having learned that he had rendered
himself very useful by his knowledge of law,
to which his Excellency understood he had
been bred, advanced him to the position
of Superintendent of Police, which car-
ried with it the post of second Police
Magistrate. Thus he became passing
rich on £350 a year. But the great-
est honor he had thrust upon him,
though the dignity is much bedraggled these
days, was his appointment in 1842 to be
first Mayor of the City of Sydney, holding
office until such time as a Municipal Council
could be elected. He died aged 75, and of
the kindly, tactful and wise old man naught
but good was said.
When Charles sailed from England he left
behind him his eldest son, Richard, aged 22.
The son followed in the steps of the father.
He too launched his barque in the troubled
waters of journalism, and became Parlia-
mentary reporter for, among other journals,
the old lion of Printing House-square, the
TIMES. He came in touch with quite a
number of prominent men of that day. Mr.
Aubrey Halloran, who takes a special in-
terest in the historical reminiscences of his
profession, relates that when Disraeli
launched the Representative he brought on
to its staff young Richard Windeyer, whom
in a letter to the publisher. .Tohn Murray,
he described as an “excellent reporter and
man of business.” But letters, whether in
shorthand or in literature, have rarely been
the paving-stones on the highway to riches.
Richard turned his attention to the law. and
was called to the Bar of the Middle Temple.
At this time his father in the antipodes
urged him to pack his trunks and ship to
N. S. Wales. The time was opportune. The
great Wardell was dead. The belligerent
doctor had fought Darling, fought a duel —-
four shots each and no one injured—fought
all the big legal battles and most of the
conventions of polite society, till at last he
came up against an opponent to whom per-
force he handed over wig and gown without
a blow. This was Windeyer's opportunity
—Wardell called to another Bar; Went-
worth drifting into politics: the field was
fairly clear. He seized it, and with his wife
and an only child, sailed for N. S. Wales.
Arrived, he at once commenced to practise
his profession, and entered on a brilliant
career. There was plenty of talent at the
Bar in those days. “All of them.’’ said a
writer, “had powerful voices, and used them
to the utmost. Foster and Windeyer were
distinguished for their cutting sarcasm,
Wentworth for his red face and irritable
lifting up the collar of his gown in his most
impassioned addresses. In private conver-
sation, when in anger, he would swear like
a trooper.” But if Charles Windeyer's pro-
fessional path was a sequence of success,
Fate offset it by a series of financial mis-
fortunes, and at the early age of 42. battling
bravely to the last, he was counted out.
His son. William Charles, dabbled a little
in journalism when Henry Parkes secured
his services as law reporter for the Empire ;
and there the newspaper strain in father
and grandfather spindled out. After that it
was the law and nothing but. the law.
LEX.
Charlotte Bronte and France
The receipt of the prospectus of a superb
Paris edition (in English) of “.Tane Eyre’
coincides with that of a London bookseller’s
catalogue announcing for sale five autograph
letters by Charlotte Bronte for £5O. Pro-
bably more than enough has been written
about the Brontes; Clement Shorter, most
enthusiastic student of all, says that when
he mentions their name in his weekly talk
in the Sphere, people write to complain that
they are tired of the subject. Yet. so wide
is their fame and so strong the hold of their
tragic history on all who read English, that
material concerning them is as precious as
that on Keats and R.L.S.. if not as endless.
One cannot help but regret that Mary Taylor
(the Rose Yorke of “Shirley”) felt it her
duty to destroy every letter Charlotte had
written her over a period of many years, on
the ground that such correspondence was
not the public's, concern. .The whole ques-
tion of what claim the public has in the per-
sonality of the artist enters in here: but
it were futile to discuss it. It might be
argued, however, that when a man or woman
sets up as a teacher, or reformer, or breaks
new ground in art. the personality of the
preacher, within understood bounds, is part
of the propaganda. We all know the little
acidities of Charlotte’s character. But we
know, too. what nobility and genius were
licrs. and the letters to Mary Taylor could
only have added to her lustre.
This French edition of “Jane Eyre” is
rather astonishing. Not only because, it is
so sumptuous —500 large quarto copies, in
vellum, water-marked “Jane Eyre,” ancient
type, lithographs by Ethel Gabain, and priced
from 8 to 35 guineas, according to binding,
etc. —but because it is “Jane Eyre” and not
a work by Bernard Shaw, Galsworthy, Kip-
ling or George Moore. Charlotte Bronte
hated the Belgians, she hated French novels,
she had no sympathy with the Latin tem-
perament, in religion or in literature. . Yet.
by a capricious turn of Time's whirligig, it
is France that to-day devotes art and crafts-
manship to exalting her.
The promotion of the work has been un-
dertaken on the initiative of a group of dis-
tinguished French collectors, who state that
they wish to prolong into the working days
of peace the friendship and alliance born in
the hour of tragedy, and to continue it in
lim domains of Letters and the Arts. No
better way could be found, they considered,
than the publication in a noble and beautiful
form of one of the greatest works in Eng-
lish, which they publish as, in some sort, a
French homage to English literature. Per-
fectly expressed as that aim is. it by no
means infers a belated recognition on the
part of France of Charlotte Bronte’s genius.
For years both “Jane Eyre” and “Villette"
have been for sale in moderately-priced trans-
lations; which means, they are read. But
an edition de luxe from the City of. Light—
that is a crown for any foreign writer! In
bestowing it on the author of “Jane Eyre”
the French offer homage not only to English
literature but to a brave and passionate
woman.

The Abrams Treatment in Practice, by G. Laughton
Scott. M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., 8.A., Oxon. (Geoffrey
Bios). The de-froeking of a Maoriland physician
who diagnosed diseases from the patient’s hand-
writing and then cured them by means of the
oseilioclast invented by the late Dr. Albert Abrams,
of ’Frisco, has put the method temporarily under
a cloud; but its great popularity in Britain, where
it is used by numbers of battling practitioners, and
the apparent genuineness of many cures, makes its
further propagation in Australia certain; so this
inquiry conducted by a presumably reputable physi-
cian and two qualified electrical engineers is timely.
An impressive array of authenticated cures, ranging
from cancer and tuberculosis to asthma and per-
sistent boils, leaves the reader wondering whether,
after all, the inventor, who reaped more from the
sale of his machines (at £l5O a box) than from
using it himself, did accidentally stumble on some new
law of Nature ; a perusal of the engineers’ report and
the diagram attached will convince anybody with
a knowledge of electrical phenomena that the thing
is mumbo-jumbo of the crudest kind. Abrams's
simple theory was that the blood or sputum of a
diseased person yielded certain vibrations which he
claimed to be able to measure, and which the
opposing vibrations from his magic box were said
to smother. What the box actually does is to
charge up the patient, who is insulated, to the
potential of the electric-light mains* with an infini-
tesimal current (about 3 0 micro-amps) at a fre-
quency of 200 to the minute. Much of the apparatus
is electrically redundant, to make it look worth the
money, and it has no power whatever to vary the
rate of charge. Every city-dweller, in short, can
get all the Abrams’s oseilioclast that he wants In-
putting a damp finger on one of the contacts of a
lamp switch. Whether the treatment will dissipate
his headache or his corns depends, apparently, on
the degree of faith he has' in the curative properties
of the current.

The Treasure-Seeker.
As I was out a-walking
On a cool Spring day,
1 met my darling Danny.
He stopped right in my way.
Said he: “Where are you going?
Said I: “My footsteps wend
In search of fairy treasure
At the Rainbow’s End!”
“Ah, listen to the foolishness!”
Said he, so very wroth ;
“ ’Tis the bad word you’d be calling
Down upon us both;
’Tis like you’ve seen the little man
And he bewitched your heart!”
Said I: “If you’ll be leaving me
I’ll make another start.”
“ ’Tis treasure she’d be seeking!”
Ah, me, so white he’d grown.
And down he laid his curly head
On a damp, mossy stone.
“Now you’re the foolish fellow,”
Said I, “but just attend :
’Tis yourself I might be finding
At the Rainbow’s End!”

Three Ships.
I saw a ship go sailing, gold and rod, go sail-
ing by;
Her crew was copper-colored, and her
Spanish skipper bold.
And her bos'n in a bright sash—-they envied
him his bright sash —■
Tucked two pistols in his bright sash.
They did what they were told;
But they itched to share the plunder that
sparkled in the hold.
I saw a ship go thrashing by, topsails gone,
go thrashing by;
Her crew was blue and freezing, and her
main shrouds hummed a song %
And the ’drift had froze the gaskets—it’s hell
with frozen gaskets—
But they had to furl with gaskets to get
their craft along.
So they tried to sing a chanty to make
their fingers strong.
I saw a ship go speeding by, twenty knots, go
speeding by:
Her crew was clean and Snaven, and tier
captain dressed in whites.
And her cargo carried passports —nice
leather-covered passports —
And guide books with their passports;
they’d come to see the sights.
Her stewards bow’d and scrap’d for tips,
and then switched off the b’srhts.

Progress.
The old conventionalities arc gone;
We walk in widening ways. The old dim
views
Of virtues straitened to dire primness lose
Their guardian for Ce. Clear-eyed, we can
look on
At life and enter in and take and share,
Though here and there some coward-spirit
shrink.
As I am coward, I have paused to think
“This valiant freedom I can scarcely bear;
And my cramped shoulders, bent for other
weight,
The burden of old servitude and use.
May cringe when even kindness bids mo
choose
At every crossroads. Am I free——too late.'
T dare not own the hauntings of my fear—
The new conventionalities are here.

Triumph.
Here, where the fire-heart dies
Gleam by red gleam,
Love will come vexing me
With an old dream.
“Fool!” I say. “Embers fall,
Chill shadows creep ;
Brave you life’s conquerors,
Silence and sleep?”
Thin, thin your laughter grows,
Mirthless and sere—
“ Love! it*is late aqd lone;
What seek you here?
“Deep in my careless heart
Long since you set
Roses for memory
Rue for regret!
“Long since you lit for me
One golden pane—
Far is its glimmer now,
Cold drives the rain!
“Hark! How the lost wind wails,
Frantic with fear,
Shrill as the banshee’s cry—
Love, do you hear?
“Have you grown bitter, too,
Jester of old,
Prince of the fairy dawn’s
Castle of gold?
“Is it to mock you come,
Recreant tunied,
Whispering, ‘Embers fade
Where life’s flame burned?’
“Youth, passion, joy are dead —
So let it be —
Still is the triumph mine;
Now at last, see !
“Here at my dreaming heart,
Blossoming yet,
Roses for memory.^
Rue for regret!”

BRUCE’S EAST OPPORTUNITY.
The ninth Commonwealth Parliament has
entered upon its last session, and the Bkuce-
I’age Government upon the most critical
period of its urbane career. There is no
doubt that the Government will survive the
session, although the customary muck-raking
no-confidence motions are threatened • the
doubt is whether it will get sufficient useful
work done to satisfy the electors that it is
entitled to another term of office. It came
into being without a mandate from the
electors, who were taken by surprise when
two parties which had fought one another
briskly in December, 1922, co-operated six
weeks later under the leadership of a young
politician who had never been mentioned as
a possible Prime Minister, having been
merely second juvenile in the Hughes
troupe; nor have they any particular reason
tor regarding it with enthusiasm. So far
it has left very faint footprints on the sands
of time. It has been a Government in kid
gloves, silk socks, spats and patent-leather
shoes: very polite and anxious to oblige,
but tepid and somewhat deficient in resolu-
tion. There have been times when its ex-
cessive politeness got on the nerves, times
when the public yearned for it to forget all
about the kid gloves, silk socks, spats and
patent-leather shoes and go after the internal
foes of the nation in pants, shirt-sleeves and
boots of the most substantial kind, with the
light of battle in its eye and a club in its
right hand: but it is not that sort of Gov-
ernment. Industrious in its fashion, it has
shed platitudes and left an impression of
perfect tailoring in parts of Australia that
never saw a Prime Minister before; and it
f* as . Passed a multitude of bills, some of them
fruitful. Also its administration has been
clean, it undistinguished, and free from that
passion for meddling which was the bane of
ihe Hughes regime. Rut it has neglected
work of the first importance, though its
output of small-beer legislation lias been
above the average. There is still time to do
I,' larger work, if the flow of Parliamentary
flapdoodle is kept within bounds ; but the pre-
sent breed of Commonwealth lawmakers has
a poor sense of the value of time.
* * *
The Government will presently be indicted
in the House of Reps, on the score of its
alleged kindness to Kidman. In point of
fact, the gravest charge that can be brought
against it is that it has hitherto failed to
act up to the Protectionism it lias so often
professed. .Ever since it took office it has
known that the tariff was ineffective. There
has been an unhealthy boom in imports, par-
ticularly in goods competing with the produce
ot Australian factories supposed to be pro-
tected, and the Customs revenue has ex-
ceeded the Treasurer’s estimates by 11 mil-
lions in two years. Yet because of this
inflated revenue, which has been handy in
vote-catching ways, and because it was afraid
to offend the Cocky Freetrade section, the
Government dodged its obvious duty for those
two years. Its Protectionist sentiments slum-
bered even when the Commonwealth Statis-
tician reported that, owing to conditions
brought about by the war, the 1920-21 tariff
had become Protective in sections than
that of 1908. Now, however, when the seri-
ous effects of the importing boom can no
longer be concealed, when factory after
factory has closed down or reduced opera-
tions, and thousands of workers in the textile
and engineering trades have placed their
names on the unemployed lists, the revenue
tariff miscalled Protective is to get some
attention. The Government’s proposals for
the session include “revision of the tariff to
give effective Protection to a few important
industries”—at least, that is the Age’s ver-
sion. According to the Argus, while “the
Tariff Act” is to be “amended. .. .the policy
of the Ministry will not be settled until vari-
ous reports by the Tariff Board have been
considered in detail.” And the Freetrade
journal darkly suggests that “it will not
be surprising _ if some duties are decreased,
and if other industries are not awarded the
high Protection they have applied for.” If
the Government’s idea is merely to tinker
with the tariff it won’t do. Tinkering is a
crude and unsettling method of dealing
with a tariff; when amendments are required,
as is obviously the case in this country, they
should be disposed of in one session instead
of being spread over several. It would be
a monstrous thing to discriminate be-
tween industries with legitimate claims to
higher duties, and there are many such indus-
tries, as the Tariff Board has been informed.
In short, tariff reform on a comprehensive
plan is an urgent matter, and the job should
be done thoroughly, even if it takes six
months. As to that, there is no reason why
Parliament should not sit for as many
months as may be required to deal adequately
with the tariff, the North-South Railway
Bill and the proposals for adding to the Air
Force and strengthening the Arbitration Act,
as well as the ordinary financial business of
the session. Nobody wants another Decem-
ber election, and honorable members have
had holidays enough.
* * * *
’Phi' Government, following the Nationalist
precedent, may appeal to the country on its
financial record, which, tested by Australian
standards, is fairly good, together with a
programme destitute of inspiration and voci-
ferous attacks on the other side. That is
what the Fuller Government did the other
day, and the Fuller Government has fallen.
In N. S. Wales, as in Tasmania, South Aus-
tralia and Westralia. the electors have shown
that they would rather take a chance with
the Labor crowd than return Administra-
tions like those of Fuller, Mitchell, Bar-
well and Lee. Not because they have any
great liking for the new Laborism. but be-
cause they are weary of dull “Nationalists”
who take n good name in vain. Bruce can
only avoid the fate which has overtaken
Fuller. Lee. Harwell and Mitchell by
demonstrating that there is Nationalism iii
the bottle as well as on the label. And there
is no time to be lost.
DEMOCRACY AND THE WORTHLESS
VOTE.
The twentieth century has seen many re-
treats from the salients of advanced opinion
and feeling which mankind had reached by
the middle of the nineteenth. The faith in
the permanance of peace, which grew into
a fairly robust creed ten years after the
Franco-Prussian struggle, was shaken largely
by the South African tumult; and the cen-
tury died to the noise of the big British
enterprise which undertook to tread the once
victorious Boer farmers in the dust. Soon
afterwards Japan flew at tbe throat of
Russia; then Italy challenged Turkey; then
the Balkan States rose and drove the Otto-
man back to his last European defences. But
the faith remained —a pathetic faith, in the
light of after-events —that the great western
European nations would never more draw tbe
sword against one another. In August, 1914,
the general murder began ; and though in a
perfectly honest sense the war was fought
for peace, the permanence of that peace is
now everywhere gravely doubted. Human
opinion has retreated from the advanced point
it. held; mankind is definitely accepted as
ranging some distance below the angels in
pacific qualities. Another, and in a way
a more important, salient of opinion is in
danger of being driven in. In the mind of
the present generation democratic freedom
is not the infallible thing it once seemed.
Italy and Spain are both under a kind of
despotism; and. though all the democratic
forms remain in the other States, there is
scarcely a country on earth from Britain to
China where a dictatorship lias not been
seriously canvassed as a possible means of
improved government. No parties are de-
finitely pledged to a dictatorship, and no
country has actually denounced democracy;
but the fact that this godlike thing of our
grandfathers’ time can be questioned at all
marks a very serious change of thought.
Thomas Carlyle declared that the object
of all political systems was to find the man
best fitted to rule, and then put him in full
charge; but it is very much to be doubted
whether any considerable body of political
thinkers of his time supported Carlyle in
this. The general notion which continued
to be strengthened right up to the beginning
of the present century was that the demo-
cratic machine could do all the work that
any one man could accomplish, though it
might be forced to work through compara-
tively poor agents. Now the whole matter
is slipping into doubt. Private concerns run
for profit arc hardly ever on a democratic
basis; and even in the most democratic
States the various public departments are
virtually under separate despots, with demo-
cracy reserving the right of criticism and
the power, to change the despot. In the
ordinary practical affairs of the commercial
world very few people would be willing to
risk their money in a concern under really
popular control; and even Communistic ex-
periments in Russia have sought the strong
hand of a single leader to give them anv
semblance of success. Not that the faith
in democracy has really gone. On the con-
trary, it is subscribed to by monarchist, re-
publican, socialist and anarchist; but the
feeling has grown that it is rather an ideal,
which is at present unworkable, than a
practicable cure-all for political diseases.
* * * .v.
The thing that is fundamentally weak
about democracy would seem to be its in-
ability to remain of one mind on any sub-
ject which does not painfully obtrude itself
every hour of the day; and this amounts
to saying that democracy is non-constructive.
B lierever there is a direct interference with
that which the public regards as its right, or
any capricious exercise of power by an estab-
lished authority, democracy will work heart
and hand to secure reform ; but the moment
reasonable political comfort has been reached
the public mind is so uncertain of its course
that its actions look almost fickle. In addi-
tion to this the popular memory is generally
very short unless fixed by some great passion-
ate outburst which has crystallised into
catch-words. Thus the people of the United
States have no political memory of the causes
except _ one which led up to the
great civil war. That war was due to
dozens of causes, of which one was
slavery. Yet there was actually a
point in the controversy between North and
South when it seemed that the South was
likely to proclaim slavery illegal; and it was
only when the North forced its view upon the
South that the contention on that question
took a central place. Now slavery is remem-
bered as the cause to the exclusion of every-
thing else. Nothing showed the shortness
of political memory in a more painful way
than the turning of Bulgarian arms against
Russia in the late war. When the atroci-
ties of the Turks in Bulgaria had stirred
a wave of indignation throughout Europe,
Russia alone, at great national risk, under-
took a long and costly war to save tin
alleged Christians of the Balkans from the
gently persuasive methods of Islam. That
war was primarily fought for the Bulgarians ;
the Bulgarians gained most through its suc-
cessful conduct; yet on the first opportu-
nity—less than 40 years later—the rescued
Bulgarians turned their arms against their
saviour. The story of the struggle for the
protection of British industries affords an
example of another kind. Two or three
times a great campaign against the destroy-
ing doctrine of Freetrade has been conducted
with the heavy artillery of convincing argu-
ment. Great ground has been gained; the
enemy’s advanced works have been totally
blown away; yet so short was the memory
of the electors that at the next election every
argument had been forgotten, and the advo-
cates of fiscal reform had to begin again
at the very alphabet of economic exposition.
It is the general survey of such things, after
the lapse of a century or so of effort to-
wards a real working democracy, which is
now causing that democracy to lose some
faith in itself. A State requires that same
kind of continuity of thought in its national
affairs as is needed by the individual in
building up a business or improving a farm ;
and there are grave enough reasons for
thinking that democracy is incapable of such
continuity of thought. So the mind of the
public runs back to the opposite extreme, and
in order to get to something definite, sug-
gests that one man should do the job at
which the many have made such a poor
attempt.
* * * *
To get to the root of the matter and find
out the cause of the shortness of democratic
memory it is only necessary to examine the
democracy in groups that come within Hie
intimate knowledge of the person making
the examination. There is Smith, who has
steadily advocated the same things for 20
years; Johnson, who is full of information
about the political movements of half a cen-
tury and who regrets the constant chopping
and changing of the winds of opinion ; and
MacDonald, whose rising contempt for the
futility of all office-holders is based on the
fact that his party programme of 30 years
ago has not yet passed into law. These three
democrats can be absolutely relied upon to
hold to an idea and give it their support. But
Thomas, a very strong partisan to-day, has
once completely changed his colors. He will
tell you frankly why he did so and by what
means he was convinced of his error. He is
a good thinker, apd it would take much to
make him retreat from his present position.
Robinson. Jones and White are of different
quality. They take their opinions ready
made from daily newspapers ; they will quote
platitudes by the hour and a slab of that
morning s leader on very small provocation.
Then there are Green. Peters and Thomp-
son, who are so completely absorbed in the
form shown by racehorses and a considera-
tion of the bets they might have won that
they are absolutely ignorant of all political
matters; and, last, there is Parks, who is
slow and dull-witted and who in a strict
S ii nse rr?? ay said Rot to know anything at
all. These 11 men make up a group of demo-
crats.; and only four of them possess any real
political mind at all. The other seven, who
represent a majority, may give any kind of
vote and cause any kind of change in the
political outlook, though their vote is clearly
Without meaning. If to these 11 men you
add .11 women, you are likely to enormously
increase the chance's that the alleged voice
ot democracy is merely a wanton noise. The
figures are then likely to show something
like six political thinkers—not necessarily
very clear thinkers at that—to 1H blind and
mindless votes. Yet the business of stam-
peding those who neither know nor can-
about political issues to the polling place
goes merrily on. A party cares only for
votes, nothing about the thought behind the
casting of the votes. Queensland has for some
time compelled the citizens to mark ballot-
papers, and the Commonwealth has adopted
the same futile system. Yet an unthinking
voter defeats the very spirit and'purpose of
democracy. All other electoral machinery is
useless as long as the majority of the votes
polled are given by people who do not under-
stand the meaning of their action ; and it is
very clear that the citizen who does not use
his franchise without compulsion is worth-
less in expressing the mind of the democracy.
Instead of forcing the people to the polling-
booth it should be a matter for rejoicing
that, through laziness or sheer lack of inter-
est, so many who have no thought to record
stay away from the polls. In the same way,
perhaps, it .was. a very good tiling that in
V S. Wales so many informal votes hav<
just been cast: it means that a large number
failed at the, very first educational test. But.
despite that sort of test, with the party organ-
isations at work the voice of the country is
hardly heard at all. So. while there is a
growing undercurrent of distrust of demo-
cracy, it is well to remember that real
democracy is not having a chance. If out:
of the present futility despotism should arise,
a real democracy would at once assert itself.
The people who have no mind on ordinary
political questions could always rise to tic
thought of breaking the rule of one man.
Even the person from the racecourse would
probably show enough rudimentary intelli-
gence to resent being trampled upon; but
once democracy was restored the picking of
doubles would become his business of life
to the exclusion of every national affair. The
only remedies would seem to be freedom from
compulsion, a restriction of party activity
by law, and, above all, political education.
Democracy has still a sporting chance of
salvation.
EDUCATION AND THE MOVIES.
In view of its immense cinema interests it
was appropriate that the TT.K.A. should have
been the first of the nations to seriously
tackle the problem of the utilisation of the
film for educational purposes. It is now a
good many years since New York City
appointed a director of visual education with
an assistant and a camera expert. Between
them they started to instal the cinema, and
last year 86 schools were handling two
or more filmed subjects per week. France,
too, despite her war-wounds and depleted
treasury, has been active. A Commission
appointed to investigate the question reported
on the desirableness of introducing the
cinema into every type of school and of fol-
lowing the matter up until all in France were
provided with ‘‘this marvellous educa-
tional instrument.” So rapid was the policy
developed that France now possesses pro-
bably the largest number of educational films
stocked in any part of the world. In the
first six months of last year the number lent
out to schools exceeded 21,000, the number
of projections was over 80,060, and more
than 36,000,000 feet of film were dismayed.
Many schools used a complete series of
technical films for teaching a given subject.
John Bull, as usual, waited a while. He
was thinking about the matter as far back as
1916, and in the early part of the present
year attained the point of having some re-
sults of his scientific experiments to exhibit.
A cinema commission of inquiry was origi-
nally established by the National Council of
Public Morals. This body went into tin-
whole question of the physical, social, moral
and educational influence of moving pictures,
and in its report expressed the opinion that
no social problem of the day demanded more
earnest attention in view of the profound
influence these graphic representations were
having on the mental and moral outlook of
millions of young people. The evidence be-
fore it did not impress the Commission with
the idea that there was any special value in
the inclusion of occasional educational films
in the entertainments placed before adult
spectators. “The public to which the cinema
appeals has not sufficient general knowledge
of science, natural history, geography or his-
tory to form that connection between pre-
vious experience and the subject matter of
the film which is so essential to vivid inter-
est.” The Commission therefore proposed a
more specialised appeal for educational pur-
poses. “To make an educational film of real
value,” it declared, “there must be pre-
liminary preparation by work in the school,
or the running comment of a lecturer.” In-
deed, the teachers and others who appeared
before it had little to say to the Commission
in favor of the educational film in a mixed
programme. Sandwiched between a Ciiarlik
Chaplin farce and the wonderful derring-do
of Tom Mix, the “educational” simply bored.
Accordingly the Council handed the matter
over to a special body for detailed investiga-
tion and two committees were appointed, one
to carry out psychological research and the
other to inquire into mechanical experiments
with a view to their applicability to teaching-
purposes.
* * * ‘ *
The British research committee has now
concluded its work, and has made a very
comprehensive report. It had some diffi-
culty in determining the form of its tests in
view of the many factors involved. In the end
the film and slides were first shown without
comment of any kind, and were then repre-
sented with a running commentary from the
teacher constituting “film-” and “slide-talk.”
and finally the unaided teacher gave the oral
lesson. Immediately after each lesson the
boys and girls who were the subjects of the
research wrote essays on what they had
learned. They were told to describe exactly
what they had seen, and information learned
outside the experiment was barred. An in-
teresting fact disclosed in connection with
the tests was that whilst boys attempted to
memorise the words in the sub-titles thrown


on the screen, the girls ignored them almost
entirely and gave word-pictures of the film
itself. The principal general results from
these tests were as follows: —
(1) Other things being equal, the greater the part
played by pictures in the lesson, the greater the
percentage of picture material in the essay.
(2) The greater the percentage of picture material,
the greater the degree of “particularity” in the
reports.
In a comparison between essays from film
alone and oral lessons of equal length, film
essays are relatively more “particular” than
oral essays. On an average the girls gave
92 per cent, of particular statements with film
essays, whereas the same girls produced only
86 per cent, of particulars in the oral-lesson
essays. This it is suggested may be regarded
as a measure of the vividness of mental im-
press. In view of that comparison the com-
mittee could not escape the conclusion that
the cinema has from every point of view “a
well-marked advantage for educational pur-
poses.”
THE LEAF OF TRANQUILLITY.
“Place upon a gentle lire the tripod whose color
and form tell of a far antiquity, and fill _ it with
renter of molten snow. Let, it seethe till it would
be hot enough to whiten fish or to redden a crab.
Then pour it upon the tender leaves into a cup made
from the earth of yue. Let it rest till the mists
which freely rise have formed themselves into thicker
clouds, and until these have gradually ceased to
weigh upon the surface and float away in vapor.
Then sip deliberately ihe delicious liquor which
drives away the five causes of disquietude. You
may taste and you may feel ; but never can you
express in words or song that sweet tranquillity wc
draw from the, essence thus prepared,”-— -From the
recipe of the Emperor Chjen-mjng.
An Australian tea-taster in Batavia —•
romantic profession, though he did not know
it—whisked me up in his car to the high-
lands where the tea is grown. The parti-
cular plantation lay beyond Buietenzorg,
where are the famous Government gardens
which have done so much for tropical agri-
culture in the Dutch Indies, and we bored
farther and farther into the green hills, and
rose higher and higher until the mists closed
down and the rain began to fall; or, rather,
we entered the region where the rain is
always falling. Mount Salak, 9000 feet, came
towards us like a blue ghost, and passed us
in the grey distance. The rice sawahs tilted
up and spilt their surplus, one into another,
all down the mountain sides; the road ran
like a river of tea, the kalis tumbled their
tea-brown floods laughing under the bridges,
and the brown women lifted their sarongs
and showed their brown legs splashed with
mud and laughed too. We ran out of the
mist of the road into the mist of infinite
space, and just as our crazy native driver,
who had never ceased to sound our horn
since leaving the Koningsplein, seemed about
to drive, us, car and all, over the edge of the
world, we stopped in a trim Dutch garden
of bare earth set with whitewashed pots on
pedestals fronting the usual square, squat
house, with bloated Doric columns enclosing
a verandah, on which the usual round table
surrounded with rocking-chairs and set with
gin and bitters awaited us.
We drank the gin and bitters, and then
the engineer, the usual stout Eurasian but
a hearty fellow, took us to see his factory,
which was full of laughing girls and giggling
children. In the light of cold reflection and
the figures in my notebook of their hours
of daily toil and the emolument they earned,
I wonder now why they should have laughed
and giggled; but laugh and giggle they did;
and, contrary to the tradition of the brutal
Dutch planter, fostered by “Max Havelaar”
and similar works of fiction, the engineer
laughed with them. There was machinery
there—English machinery by Ransome,
Sims and Jefferies, Ipswich, who may be
dead now for all I know, since the date on
their handiwork was 1894 —but it did not
seem to matter. The children played over
it, and the girls squatted round it, and what
work was being done was being done by
hand. Women, the only ones with serious faces,
tossed trays of leaves to eliminate the stalks,
and got fivepence a day for doing it. The
children ran about and shifted things with-
out any apparent aim, and got threepence
for an 11-liour day, and a halfpenny for an
evening’s overtime. The estate was 60 years
old, and had a 75 years’ lease; and, with
the aid of the laughing children and the
giggling girls and water-power drawn from
a lake 20 miles away, it produced 650,0001 b.
of tea at one and fourpence a pound ; and
expended sevenpence a pound in doing it.
That, at any rate, is what the fat engineer
told me, smiling his patriarchal smile over his
flock—though most of them, he explained,
were away at the moment getting in the
rice harvest: it seemed to be a family affair,
but it was a family affair that made big
profits for its foreign shareholders.
As our motor, sounding its horn like the
hosts of the Lord before Jericho, lowered
us through the mists down to the plains
again. I reflected on the vicissitudes Aus-
tralia’s national beverage has undergone,
and recollection 'of a houseboat journey
through the once-famous tea centre of Ningpo
in China returned. Its blue hills, now
clothed in forest, were once studded with
the knobbly tea-slirub, and 40 years ago any
Australian schoolboy would have been able
to tell you where it was; to-day he would
have to search a long time for it.
At one time the river was visited
yearly by hundreds of ships from Europe;
nowadays it is an out-station of Shanghai
and Hongkong. Those were the great days
of Chinese commerce. Not that the import
and export trade of China could compare in
actual figures with that of to-day; but the
risks were considerable and the profits pro-
portionately immense; buying and selling
were enterprises invested with all the
glamor of romance. There were real mer-
chant princes in those days. They were
dictatorial as kings or servile as slaves, as
suited their occasions; and at this distance
they look more splendid apparitions than our
modern captains of industry. Nevertheless,
their prosperity was short-lived. In 1860
not a leaf came out of India or Ceylon.
Thirty vessels at a time would lie in harbor
at Ningpo preparing for the race across
the world and to Australia with the first
season’s pickings. Then Robert Fortune
collected and shipped some plants to India,
and in Assam another unadvertised patriot,
Dr. Jameson, assiduously fostered the in-
dustry by means of Government plantations.
By 1879, of the ISO million pounds con-
sumed in England 24 millions came from
India; by 1910 the Indian and Cinga-
lese contribution had risen to 211 million
pounds and the Chinese had dropped to 81.
Australia followed the shifting market, first
getting all her tea from China and after-
ward most of it from India and Ceylon.
Java came late into the field ; nevertheless,
she already fills Australia’s billy more than
halfway up.
We rushed, barking like a rabid dog, into
Batavia as the tropic night closed swiftly
down; and looking back I saw the sunset
mirrored in ten thousand panes of glass.
That enormous skylight of the gods stretch-
ing back into the folds of the hills was the
native rice-fields where men, women and
children work the day long for a smaller
pittance even than the tea-workers earn.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Development, of the Commonwealth
Shipping Line.
The reasoning process by which the Prime
Minister has decided to make a plunge
and build a whole lot more ships is
complicated. The decision arises out
of his inability to persuade some outside
company to buy the seven Government ves-
sels which are not obsolete, to add enough
good vessels to make a regular line, and to
run them here under the conditions that re-
sult in a loss to Australia of about. £700,000
per annum if moderate depreciation, is
allowed for. Why the failure of his realisa-
tion scheme should have so radically altered
the Prime Minister’s plans as to start him
cm another orgy of construction it is hard
to say; but the heroic burst is excused on
the plea that the future is to be very different
from the past. The Government is going to
“tighten up industrial conditions,” and will
also “endeavor to eliminate those factors
which are at present operating to the detri-
ment of the line.” But it has to be kept in
mind that the factors are just as likely to
eliminate Bruce. Indeed, that sanguine
gentleman will certainly be eliminated one
day, and then the prospects are that his re-
forms will go, while his ships and his huge
building programme will remain. At the
best his promise is merely a revised version
of the remark which the Principal Sheep
made when it viewed the damage done by the
Habitual Dingo, for it also stated that the
elimination of the beast would have to be
attended to. The commendable ambition of
S. M. Bruce is “to maintain adequate and
reasonable shipping facilities for our pro-
ducers.” What has been managed, if the,
present freight rates are really the work of
the Commonwealth’s bit of competition, is
to secure a somewhat reduced rate for rather
more than half this country’s external trade
(for the Commonwealth fleet covers a strictly
limited area), leaving the balance as it was,
and the exceedingly important coastal trade
very much worse than it was (at latest
advices the wheat and flour rate from Aus-
tralia to England was 355. per ton, and the
general rate from to Launceston
was 40s. 6d.). Considering what the loss
is, quite apart from what it may be if Bruce
leaves a bigger fleet for a wild successor
to play with, the game doesn’t seem worth
half the candle. It is probable that equally
good results as regards export freights could
be obtained at less cost by biting the ear of
Private Enterprise with a subsidy. As for
freights on imports, they are of less account.
If the people who prefer foreign goods to tin;
Australian variety have to pay more for then-
craze, it may mitigate the craze.

The First Fowl of the Season.
When Lang attains the N.S.W. Premiership
in the near future lie will find a monster bird
on the roost waiting for him. In the rush for
votes he promised job control of the rail-
ways, and a conference of unions took him at
his word, and hurriedly jobbed out a scheme
of which some leading features are: —
(1) Control by three Commissioners, of whom the
Labor Government shall appoint one and the em-
ployees two, selected by ballot.
This means that about 50,000 rail and tram
men will have two-tliirds of the voting power
which controls the State’s biggest national
asset, while retaining their share of authority
as ordinary citizens. The other 1:} million
or so of adult inhabitants will have wliat is
left. As an instance of plural voting this
ought to take a prize.
(2) Piecework pay, bonuses for good service and
any and all inducements to give capable service
to be rigidly banned.
The ballot for Commissioners, being on the
same lines as the pre-selection of candidates
with the dubious ballot-box, will, in fact, pro-
bably rule out the energetic worker as a per-
son who sets a bad example.
(3) Once every fortnight “union officials” are to
be consulted by departmental heads about “griev-
ances,” which are evidently expected to be very
numerous even under the new order.
This introduces another element into the
control.
(4) The working week to be five days of eight
hours each.
If the 40-hour week is accompanied by an
increase of wages (and a man with two
clear days for amusement is apt to require
some spending money) the expense bill is
likely to be an interesting study.
(5) Every employee is to have 11 free passes
(first-class) per annum for himself, six of them being
good all over the Commonwealth.
The other States and the Federal department
will have to be paid for their share in all
tliis. either in cash or in corresponding con-
cessions in N. S. Wales. In the first ease
the expense will be quite surprising, and in
the second alternative N. S. Wales will need
more rolling stock to carry the deadheads.
The poorer States will probably demand
cash, the money being useful and they having
no desire that their staffs shall spend their
time wandering about the Ma State. As no
average employee can travel over the length
and breadth of this spacious Commonwealth
six times a year, even if he steals his food as
he goes, the six passes will probably be
transferable, and be put on the market.
(6) The same privileges are to be extended to
each employee’s wife, to his housekeeper if he has
no wife, to his children aged under 16, and to all
retired employees and their wives.
The man who retires early and takes to
commercial travelling should find liimself
on a good wicket. Also there is something
quaint and invidious about, the proviso that
a widower may take bis housekeeper with
him on his travels at the public expense.
If she has a husband living, surely in the
interests of morality he should come along
on a free pass ; for what is one more pass
among so many? When all this lot is added
up, it should run to a couple of million gratis
first-class long-distance tickets per annum
at a moderate computation. Yet, all said
and done, Lang is only being presented with
his own legitimate bill a little sooner than
lie expected to get it. His promises were
vague in spots, but when he was at the
top of his campaign frenzy they were large
enough to give reason for all these demands.
And when he becomes Premier, and doesn’t
grant sufficient of the programme to put the
petitioners in good fettle for asking the
balance later on, he may have to face more
excitement than is good for any house-agent.

Pioneering in the North.
Sir George Buchanan, the expert on har-
bors imported by the Federal Government,
recently delighted everybody by a declaration
made at Port Darwin that that ramshackle
and ill-fated tropical settlement would some
day be one of the great cities of the world;
but be has since qualified his statement by
pointing out that be was careful when be
made the prophecy not to predict under what
nationality this glorious consummation would
be realised. Ho lias made matters worse
since his return south by giving impressions
of white colonisation in Queensland and the
Northern Territory which are, to say the
least of it, melancholy reading for White Aus-
tralians. He found the pioneers of tropical
development living under conditions quite
unsuitable for the tropics. “Tin boxes” was
too good a name for their houses. Their
dietary consisted of meat three times a day,
too little fruit and vegetables and too much
beer. Their women suffered even worse pri-
vations—for too much of a good thing in
the tropics is just as much privation as too
little in the temperate zone. They lived
on the same wrong diet as their menfolk,
but had not equal opportunities of outdoor
work to correct the evil results of it. They
spent half their time cooking this unneces-
sary food in little kitchens as hot as ovens
that a black servant in India would refuse
to enter; and they occupied their leisure in
arguments with their spouses as to the advi-
sability of a change “down south.” It was
quite impossible for a healthy white race ?o
exist under these circumstances. Doctors
confirmed bis own impressions, and it seemed
that the real reason why white occupation
still persisted was that it was constantly
getting fresh draughts of new blood from
the more temperate regions. This declara-
tion, which has elements of truth in it, was
claimed by advocates of a semi-black _ Aus-
tralia as an argument in favor of the intro-
duction of colored labor. How this is going
to lead to the uplift of the white residents
is not explained, the experience in tropical
U.S.A. being that where the imported nigger
is thickest the resident white is most de-
praved. In any case there is nothing new
in the discovery that the opening up of vir-
gin country is attended with risks and a
certain degree of inconvenience even in the
temperate or Arctic zones. That these dis-
abilities are overcome as population increases
is a commonplace of history. When Hong
Kong was first occupied the white mortality
was utterly appalling; to-day the barren and
crowded rock is healthier than London.
Manila under the slovenly Spaniard was a
death-trap for Europeans; under the Ameri-
cans it has been made a safer place for white
mothers to have babies in than San Fran-
cisco. New rubber land in Borneo and
Malaya has always claimed a heavy toll of
white lives; but planters and their wives
live healthier lives there now than they would
in Melbourne. The reason is not far to seek.
A reform in clothing led to an enormous
improvement in the health of the Dutch in
Java: the filling of a moat had a miraculous
effect in the Philippines; the application of
commonsense and science to food, clothes,
houses and way of living in Equatorial
America made the Panama Canal possible;
roads and railways spread hygiene and sani-
tation over the Malay Peninsula; fresh
vegetables and fruit banished dysentery from
Hong Kong. No esoteric magic or great
statecraft either is needed to bring these
blessings to tropical Queensland and the
Northern Territory. There is no reason, ex-
cept ignorance and prejudice and Govern-
mental foolishness, why workers in the North
should not be as well and suitably housed and
fed as workers in the South. The U.S.A.,
regarding the Panama Canal as essential
to the country’s preservation, made an heroic
effort to overcome the natural difficulties of
the enterprise and succeeded; the effective
occupation of the North is of at least as
great importance to Australia and is worth
a similar effort; and the introduction of
hordes of discolored helots is not going to
quicken the process or make it any easier.
The Court of Vacillation.
The Federal Court of Conciliation, Arbitra-
tion and Vacillation lias had one more of its
doubts removed. The President, whose hesi-
tating career was closed for the time being by
the handing over of his duties to Deputy-
President Webb, left to that gentleman a
legacy of outstanding questions which quite
bewildered that worthy semi-Judge. As the
latter could not relieve himself of the burden
by taking a vacation, he happily bethought
himself of the expedient of dumping his
troubles on to the High Court ; and, deter-
mining to make a thorough job of it, he
scheduled a long series of problems embody-
ing his doubts and hesitancies. The bulk
of the schedule the High Court promptly
turned down, on the ground that it was_ not
its business to answer hypothetical questions.
“Let us have specific facts and clear ques-
tions of law. and we’ll know where we are;
hut as to what the Arbitration Court might
do if something happened that hasn’t yet
arisen is no business of ours” —that was the
attitude the Court took, and about 75 per
cent, of the body of doubts still await, un-
dissipated, the return of the President. Tie-
issues the Court did settle it settled witli
firmness, promptitude and the explicit answer
that leaves no room for doubt. It was asked
“Has the Court of Conciliation and Arbitra-
tion, and have I as deputy-president thereof,
power to cancel the registration of the Sea-
men’s Union in the proceedings mentioned
in this case (i.e., the application by the Aus-
tralian Shipping Board and the Common-
wealth Steamship Owners’ Association for
deregistration of the union) or on any other
proper application made on similar
grounds?” To which the Court replied
that it and he had. His Court if
properly constituted had jurisdiction to
hear alid determine the application to
cancel the registration of the union; more-
over, the Parliament of the Commonwealth
had power to invest the Court with the right
to do so. What apparently had fretted the
deputy’s soul was anxiety whether the rights
conferred on him as a court were really
rights that the Federal legislature could con-
stitutionally give him. This sort of dubiety
is characteristic of all who have anything
to do with this extraordinary sport from
the judicial growth. Not one of its adminis-
trators seems to be easy in his mind as to
whether it really is a court or not, and their
doubt is very widely shared by the public.
At any rate, offenders against its awards
laugh and pass it by. or obey or disobey its
mandates at their own sweet will, and the
Court bites its thumb, doubts the reality of
the whole business —and does nothing. The
position is very unsatisfactory; and, though
the High Court decision has improved it a
little, the fact that the chief administrator
of this law has so many other doubts about
his powers calls for the earliest attention of
the Government.

The Disadvantages of Living in a
Crater.
One of the first problems Maoriiand’s new
Premier has been asked to consider is how
to overcome the disability of having a capi-
tal city in the bottom of a crater. The
trouble has existed ever since about 1840,
when the first settlers, having been swept by
floods off the only piece of flat ground in
the neighborhood of Port Nicholson, moved
across to the other side of the harbor and
set up the city of Wellington where it now
hangs. The awkwardness of trying to do
business while clinging to the edge of a
precipice early presented itself, and was
temporarily avoided by dredging some hori-
zontal foothold from the harbor. The shores
being steep, this method could not be car-
ried far. After the war the trouble became
acute, and was attacked by the Massey Gov-
ernment in the customary way—by means of
a moratorium and a fair rents court. The
result was that builders stopped erecting
new houses which didn’t pay, and rushed into
the more lucrative business of buying up old
tenements, giving them a lick of paint and
selling them at inflated prices as apartment
houses. Six-roomed wooden hutches, 30 years
old, witli no land in front and a perpendicu-
lar back yard, which probably cost £6OO to
build, changed hands for as much as £3500,
and dwellings that had with difficulty pro-
vided for the comfort of two old ladies and
a parrot were pushed and bulged into accom-
modating half a dozen families. The rents
accruing from these genteel slums rose to as
much as £2O a week for a ten-roomed house,
and the price of the goodwill soared so
rapidly that it was possible for a person
to leave honest employment, purchase a lease
and in a fortnight retire with the money
equivalent of a year’s hard labor. Having
killed the private building trade, the Gov-
ernment went into the complicated business
on its own account, and after running up
an inadequate number of standardised con-
crete dwellings at Miramar, a flat piece Of
ground subject to inundation outside the
crater bottom, it gave tin- business best when
the cost of construction began to exceed the
original estimate by about 25 per cent. The
position now is that, owing to a recent slump
in building, there are fewer hutches
available than ever, while the rents range
round about two guineas for a double room
with a communal bath on the landing and
a common kitchen down three flights of
stairs, and there is a greater shortage of
new dwellings than before. The Mayor, in
a tour recently taken through his crowded
diocese, unearthed, among other features, a
husband, wife and four children living in
a garage fitted with a fireplace, e.l. and sink,
for which accommodation they were paying
225.; on the same section he found three
small rooms accommodating three adults and
four children at a rental of 31s. a week. His
solution of the difficulty is that the Govern-
ment and the Council should return to the
expedient already proved abortive, and
build more houses, leaving the problem
of the crater where it was. The
mere effort of dragging bricks and
mortar, butter, eggs and the morning
paper up and down the crater walls will
always make the cost of high. The
rocky basin has only two negotiable exits* —*
one through the wall itself by means of tun-
nels and another along its edge stewards the
Hutt Valley. The Hutt Valley, despite the
Wellington politicians’ neglect to. provide
wharves or dredge the foreshore, is gradu-
ally becoming the industrial sulfmrb whence
everything is dragged to the capital to be
shipped. Nelson, on the South Island oppo-
site the Windy City, which was once mooted
as the capital, and has all the advantages
the other lacks, is starved for transport in
the interests of its elder sister. Auckland,
which isn’t in a crater bottom, long ago out-
distanced its hampered rival in population:
Christchurch is going in the same direction.
Altogether, the endeavor to maintain the
administrative centre of a coutntry in the
bottom of an extinct volcano isf proving sin
expensive hobby, for which the dwellers in
the crater mainly have to pay.

Internationalism and Shanghai.
The immediate cause of the upheaval in the
Shanghai foreign settlement, where Chinese
police in European employ are shooting down
their compatriots, is the well-meant endeavor
of the white municipal council, which is the
Government of the territory, to please the
International Labor Bureau at Geneva by
introducing new by-laws with regard to child
labor in foreign factories. English and
American employers favored the measure,
but the Japanese, w T lio are alleged to own
the worst factories, disliked it; and they
killed it by the simple expedient of absent-
ing themselves en masse from the ratepayers’
meeting, which failed to obtain a quorum in
consequence. Although, ostensibly aimed at
the Japanese, the agitated protest of the
Chinese is directed at foreign industry in
and clamoring for spurious market regulation, are in
leality representative of the spirit of our pastoral
pioducers. Woe is it that they are encouraged to
squeal by high political personages, and woe that the
scream has not been summarily silenced long before
now, for the longer it continues the more harm it
will do.
Panic was the cause of the collapse in the wool
market, and the restoration of confidence can be its
only amendment. But traders with this country,
under every fundamental law of their business, cannot
regain confidence if one of the parties to the trans-
action seeks to tie the other’s hands. And this is
what this noisy scream for artificial control amounts
to. No man will take big losses of money lying
down, and traders in last season’s wool made enormous
losses, which they are anxious to make good by
further and profitable operations. It is to our ulti-'
mate advantage that they succeed, since only in
that manner can the initial purchasing power of
consumers be restored, and without this purchasing
power any statistical advantage of supply is of no
avail. But no free trading can occur with the im-
position of artificial restraint on export, and real
confidence on the part of purchasers will not exist
so long as this possibility is in sight. We have
had a nasty experience, certainly—a very nasty
°ue and probably suffered a reverse the degree of
which was not economically justified ; but this is a
contingency of world trading, and it is only in world
trading that we can negotiate the sale of our wool.
But it is folly to try to harness these broad opera-
tions in a system patently parochial. Every hour
of this miserable clamor for control is prejudicial to
the restoration of confidence and the re-establishment
oc a sound basis of business.
This basis possibly should be a little better than
even the clamorists suppose—not so high as in
November last, but perhaps better than to-day’s.
There is a shortage of wool in the world, though
hardly so much as was once stated, and there :s
a justification for high prices, though not boom
prices—there is never justification for these latter ;
they always spell disaster. But the ci'y that the
price of woollen goods is getting too high for the
pocket of the consumer, on account of the price of
the raw material, is exaggerated, and the consequent
thie&t of the utilisation of wool substitutes is over-
done. After all, the value of the raw material in
a woollen fabric is only from 10 per cent, to 12
per cent, of the total, so that a variation of 10 per
cent, in the price of the wool is equivalent to only
a hundredth of the price of the finished article, if
the value of the substitute is half that of the woo),
and 50 per cent, of it is used, it would make a'
difference of about 21 per cent, in the last cost—not
a very large consideration, when all is said and done.
But the higher the price of wool becomes, the larger
wiH be the percentage cost, so that, by economic laws,
the ascendancy of prices will cut itself out naturallv.
When artificial restraint is put on to any part of the
system, the machinery of business principles is bound
sooner or later in some unknown spot to go
wiong. If wool is too cheap now, competition, if
left alone, will bring it to a correct level. But who
is going to arbitrarily determine what the correct
level may be ?
Hysterics never accomplished anything except
disaster. It was hysterical panic that accomplished
the collapse in wool values, following on a necessary
readjustment, emanating probably from French an I
American banking institutions. It is certainly safe
to say that the downfall was not brought about by
Yorkshire trade machinations. Yorkshiremen prob-
ably have been the heaviest losers of all. British
traders, though we may resent certain of their
methods, still maintain a commercial integrity
superior to that of any other nation in the world.
Their financial stability, also, is the solid rocj;
of the world’s commerce. If these control-damorists
rea..sed how much the financing of the world’s wool
trade rested on British shoulders, they would put
some of the restraint they talk about on their own
powers of buse. After all. there is probably no
other world s commodity sold in such volume for
wlich the producer receives cash like his wool. He
himself can buy sheep on bills of all lengths of
duration, and the wool manufacturer sells his goods
on very long terms; but wool is paid for within
14 days.

Proportional Representation.
It has been shown once more in N. S Wales
that proportionalism is a fool of a system
hut the preposterous thing still finds de-
fenders. One of them is Ley, the glib Min-
ister ot Justice, whose clumsy Nc Ternerc
legislation was a factor in the Nationalist
deteat, and who is ambitious of succeeding
the elderly and disappointed Fuller,
although Bavin, who won the only personal
triumph of the election on the Ministerial
side, should obviously be the next party
leader. W hile the count was in progress

that the aggregate figures show a definite
majority of anti-Labor votes, which should
reflect itself in a definite majority in the
Leg. Assembly”—47-48, lie suggested, or, at
the worst. 40-44. Four days later it was
clear that Labor had secured 45 of the 90
scats with less than half the votes. At the
moment of writing it lias a chance of ousting
a Progressive in Goulburn and a Nationalist
m Murrumbidgee, and either success would
give it a majority of seats with a
minority of votes. Among other gro-
tesque anomalies, 8058 Nationalist voters
failed to elect one member in New-
castle, whereas 8400 Labor voters elected
two members in Sturt. So much for the
frequent assertion that proportion alism en-
ables the majority to rule and considerable
minorities to get representation. If no
change occurs in Goulburn and Murrum-

and the real importance of the movement
is to be found in the fact that the usually
timorous Government in Peking is support-

Britain, the handing over of the foreign con-
cessions and an indemnity, and some of the

have far-reaching consequences for the West-

One of Hughes’s strokes of genius was to
raise the excise on Australian brandy almost
out of sight. Probably the intention was to
reduce the impost again when the financial
pressure eased, but camouflaged Freetraders
have to be reminded a mighty lot when it is a
mere Australian industry that is doing a
perish, whether it is woollens or hats, or
electro-plate, or brandy, or boots. The present
position is that a considerable area has been
planted with Doradilla grapes which are good
only for distilling purposes, and as the
Government takes two-thirds of the proceeds
in excise duty, there isn’t much of a crust
left for the grower—often a returned soldier
who dodged the Hun in Flanders only to run
up against a more disastrous robber at
home. The Foreign-trader’s demand that,
in view of the big surplus, a little less should
be taken from the people under the tariff,
is a legitimate ambition and an honorable
howl if directed into a proper channel, which
isn’t the one the shoddy creature aims at.
To sacrifice a trifle and promote an immensely
promising Australian industry is a better
proposition than the imported shoddy-
monger’s habitual idea of reducing income
and cutting down local employment at the
same time.
♦
The British M.P. who devoted some weeks
of his extra-Parliamentary time to closely
studying, and a series of press articles to
relentlessly exposing, the abominably filthy
methods by which Turks and Greeks prepare
their dried fruits for the market has done
a far better service to his countrymen (and,
incidentally, to Australia) than scores of
more ambitious politicians. Also, it makes
one wonder if the U.K. would smack its
lips so much as it does over the choice
vintages, renowned for centuries, from coun-
tries such as Spain, Portugal and Italy, if
the same unpleasant light were thrown on
Pietro’s and Diego’s ways of preparing the
grape for its making-glad-the-heart-of-man
mission. Industrial methods change little in
southern and western Europe, and it is
doubtful whether they have changed much'
or at all since the days of which Macaulay
wrote:—
And in the vats of Luna
This year the must shall foam
Round the white feet of laughing girls
AVhose sires have marched to Rome.
What manner (and color) of hoofs the must
foamed (and maybe still foams) round in
years of peace is left to the imagination.
In this hygienic age it might be possible
to give a valuable boost to the consumption
of Australian wine in Britain by impressing
on John Bull how little regard is paid to
cleanliness in the case of certain favored
brands of “purple joy.”

The picture which Sir George Buchanan
recently drew of the unsuitable homes in
which the people of the Far North dwell
has no special and exclusive connection with
the tropics. There are abundance of summer
regions far south of Capricorn where the
Australian requires to learn the art of living
just as much as he does north of that line,
and fails in much the same way. N. S.
Wales is generally quoted as the richest of
the States. It is certainly the oldest, and
has had most opportunity to build itself a
solid home. Yet at last census, out of
408,925 dwellings built of specified sub-
stances, 225,902 were iron, wood, lath-and-
plaster, wattle-and-dab, bark, “calico, canvas,
hessian, etc.,” mud and “bushes, rushes, etc.”
And after all this “etc.” there was still a
tail and a lower depth, for 318 homes were
of “other materials.” Out of 414,468 roofs
enumerated in the Ma State 296,047 were
iron—“the thin, tin, crackling roof” that
Kipling described, and a melancholy
material in a time of heat or any time. In
addition 14,840 were made of odds and ends.
The inmates averaged almost exactly one
per room, which suggests that in many
humble homes there is even a bed in the
library. These facts don’t contradict the
Prime Minister’s recent wild assertion that
the Australian has a higher standard of liv-
ing than anybody else on earth, but they
don’t exactly prove it.

From the Federal lobbies :
Apropos of Pearce’s “Scheme for the Creation of
a Commission to l>ire<t the Development of Northern
Australia,” as it is grandiloquently called, the yarn
is that one of the jobs will be offered to ex-Premier
Theodore and that another has been reserved for
Senator Drake Brockman. Whether Theodore will
accept is problematical. In Queensland a few months
back he broadly hinted that nothing would please
him more, but after his recent electioneering tour
of N. S. Wales he said that he would go on with
his candidature for the Herbert. His idea then was
that his party would have a good chance of gaining
the four N. S. Wales Federal seats —Calare, Mac-
quarie, Riverina and Lang or Robertson—without
which it cannot hope to grab the reins of office; but
this impression will be modified when he studies the
State election figures. There are reports that
Bam ford, who would be a formidable opponent, may
stand again for Herbert, after all, and that Bucklet,
formerly M.L.A. for Sydney, will also nominate in the
hope of getting even with the man who ratified his
expulsion from “the movement” ; so Theodore will
think hard before he rejects the proffered Commis-
sionership. As for Drake Brockman, he has agreed
t > sacrifice himself so that Pearce may get Cocky
support next year, and something, of course, will
have to be done for the interesting martyr. There is
a precedent for sending a Drake Brockman north —
a younger brother is a Judge in the Mandated Terri-
tory. Still, if the “scheme” has no worthier objects
than getting Theodore out of the way and placing
a Senator who has obliged Pearce, it will have a
rough passage in Parliament.

A matter with which Adelaide has been
quietly humming for some weeks has come
out into the open at last. Professor Coleman
Phillip,son, the brilliant international jurist
who has held the Chair of Law for five
years (since Jethro Brown gave it up),
suddenly resigned it, on the ground that he
had filled the term of his engagement and
had work to do in Europe. The University
accepted, in a friendly letter. But the
newspapers would not leave it at that, know-
ing that Judges Poole and Parsons and
Isbister, K.C. (all members of the Univer-
sity. Council), had been sitting as a committee
of inquiry. The press got a “statement”
from the ex-Professor. It was sensational,
claiming that the University in asking him
to resign had used a bludgeon in the dark,
and that on any showing he had com-
mitted no more than an indiscretion. The
one thing that everyone seems to know
is that discussion took place between
Arthur Rymill —bank director and racing
motor-boat owner—and his wife on the
one side and the Professor on the other
about private tuition for their son, a
law student, and that a heavy fee was men-
tioned. But which side “approached” the
other, and just what was said or implied, is
a matter of unfriendly argument. The last
word at present remains with Coleman
Piiillipson, who says that he was directly
asked to do the coaching, and always made
it a condition that the University Council
should first be asked for leave. This would,
as he says, be an indiscretion at the most.
, The University would not be at all likely to
give leave for a professor to augment his
salary heavily by coaching a single student.
But in fairness to all parties concerned, the
Council can hardly let the matter remain in
the semi-darkness that now obscures it.
«
“Troopiiorse” : “Northerner” is hardly
fair when he puts most of the blame oil
Black Brother for the prevalence of v.d. in
North Australia (B. 30/4/’25). There is
plenty of evidence, including a report by
the Australian Institute of Tropical Medi-
cine at Townsville, to show that the natives
of the N.T. and North Australia are, in their
natural state, exceptionally healthy com-
pared with those of other tropical countries.
But here, as everywhere, natives who have
come into close contact with new settlers,
whites and Chinese, rapidly fall victims to
diseases which are new to them. In particu-
lar they readily become addicted to the
opium habit, and amongst them it rapidly
induces moral and physical degradation.
Nevertheless, during 1918, at the Darwin
Hospital, out of ten cases of syphilis only
three were aboriginals. Gonorrhoea cases
numbered 32, of which 25 w T ere Europeans,
one Japanese and six aboriginals. No doubt
the natives carry a good deal of disease; but,
all things considered it is less than might
be expected, considering the conditions and
their handicap of ignorance.

POLITICAL
POINTS
George Fuller will be remembered for
various things that he was still going to do
when the opportunity slipped out of jus
fingers. He didn’t reform the legislative
Council in any way, so it may again be inun-
dated with 1(5 trade-union secretaries. He
left as he found it the rotten and undemo-
cratic system by which casual Assembly
vacancies, caused by death, retirement or the
mollifying of an inconvenient opponent w n i
a salaried appointment, are not filled by elec-
tion but by party nomination. Thus nominees
may creep in whom their alleged constitu-
ents wouldn’t have at any price; and, worst
of all. the community is muzzled for three
years, and the Ministry isn’t restrained from
doing bad things by the fear that its majority
of one or two may go up in smoke at by-
elections if it plays the “uncouth crook
game too glaringly.
When Walsh, of the Seamen’s Union,
assured the Arbitration Court in the plainest
words that the two long-held-up federal
ships would not be manned, whatever _it
might say or do, he announced himself de-
finitely as a person who defied the law. It
isn’t anticipated, however, that the law will
do much. Little as Australians seem to
realise the fact, their Commonwealth has tor
years been going to pieces, chiefly because two
truculent importees named Walsh and •lohan-
son tried a struggle with it, and it duln t
struggle more than a stuffed doll, let a tew
sentences of six months’ hard would pro-
bably have crumpled up the revolution a
little while ago, when it was still m tne
stuffed-doll stage.
Denison (Hobart) was the pivotal electorate
in the Speck on June 3. By returning four
Laborites it gave Premier Lyons a majority,
and will enable him to dispense with the ser-
vices of Speaker Evans and still be one to
the good on the floor of the House. the
new Speaker will probably be John Dray-
man” Woods, who lias re-entered State poli-
tics again after a long spell in the 1 ress
Gallery. Woods has held the job before.
There is something uncanny about the
luck of George Foster Pearce. Until the
other day nothing looked darker than the
election prospects of the colorless individual
who, principally by changing convictions,
parties and leaders at convenient seasons,
lias been a Senator for 24 years and a Min-
ister for nearly 16. He seemed fated to be
crushed between Nat.-Lib. and Cocky candi-
dates for the Senate, as his friends Do
Largie. Henderson and Buzaeott were in
1922. Now, however, Senator Drake Brock-
man has arranged to stand down in favor
of a Country-party candidate, and the C ocky
organisation has agreed to support a I earce-
Lyneh-Cocky ticket. Further, the \N est-
ralian Labor Government has made such
a hash of things that thousands of embit-
tered citizens will vote against the Labor
nominees for the Senate just to show what
they think of the Cocktail Cabinet. A State
Labor Ministry is nearly always a handicap
to Federal Labor candidates, but the burden
of the Cocktail Cabinet will be crushing. So,
barring accidents. Pearce will start at even
money next year, instead of 25 to 1 (offered).
Priminister Bruce having offered his big
ships for sale on condition that the buyer
kept them on the Australian run under the
same drawbacks and annoyances which have
made the line bankrupt already, there were
naturally no bids. When a partially-fried
martyr in olden times offered the stake and
the goodwill of the martyr business for sale
as a going concern there weren’t many bids
either.
Having secured re-election to the Uppah
Cliambah of Victoria. Frank Clarke will
be given another lease of the chair.
W. LI. Edgar, who had no difficulty in East
Yarra, will be again chairman of committees.
The changes made in the House by the elec-
tions were negligible. The Cocky party
secured one additional seat because it
couldn’t help itself. Frank Clarke pulled
out of the Northern Province to stand for
South Melbourne, and three Hayseeds went
to the poll for the Murrayside constituency.
Bath (Nelson). Russell Clarke (Southern)
and White (Western) were unsuccessfully
challenged by Cockies. Bell retained his
Wellington seat, and will go back on the
Railway Committee. . Only one-third of the
electors entitled to vote troubled to exercise
the franchise.
From a Labor notebook: —
Not the least interesting feature of the N.S.W.
election from the Labor standpoint was the rout
of the Bailey faction. Ever since he was east out of
the party, Bailey, A.W.TT. boss and sometime
M.L.A. for Goulburn, has been a rallying point
for A.L.P. malcontents. Anyone expelled from a
league, defeated in a selection ballot or in trouble
with the Willis executive was sure of championship
AFTER THE FIGHT.
“The result of the N.S.W. elections is that no party has been returned with a working majority."
THE COMBATANTS (together): “Who won?"
at the Bailey headquarters, while those who were
against him had the whole Bailey organisation to
fight. Peter Loughlin, deputy-leader of the party,
became a target for Bailey hostility because he helped
to beat Jim Mc'Girr, MX.A., for the Cootamundra
selection. The said Jim was a fine fellow until
the Willis executive gave him a nomination for
Cumberland ; then the Bailey forces were marshalled
to help the other A.L.P. candidates. Both Jim
and Peter were elected. Mayor Stokes, one of
Bailey’s judges in the ballot-box business, also had
to fight the Bailey influence, but Stokes got in.
So did Evatt, whom sympathisers with Bailey heckled
at Balmain meetings; while Mrs. Dwyer, who was
supported by the Baileys, missed the ’bus. In id ct,
the Bailey faction failed everywhere, and Willis,
who has just recovered damages from the A.W.U.
paper, is decidedly on top.
Complaints appear almost daily to the
effect that North Queensland is increasingly
haunted by a superfluous type of Greek, who
has been found sleeping as many as 20 in
a room. He is accused of many strange
vices, including the white-slave trade and
dubious fish, and his pervadingness in the
North is ascribed to the fact that the climate
is good enough to suit anybody, and it is
a quiet spot where the police don’t trouble
much. One of the Bruce regulations which
never lead anywhere provides that a man
may not come into Australia unless he has
£4O or more in money (often borrowed for
the occasion), whereas it might be more
useful to enact that he must be caked with
less than 40oz. of dirt. There is also a lan-
guage test, and it is strong enough to keep
out all Greece and Turkey as well, but it
isn’t much used.
The Ma State Assembly lost its only real
humorist when Gregory McGirr went down
at the general election. Three years ago
the man who was then Labor Minister for
Motherhood, and who might be standing in
Lang’s shoes could lie have mastered an
impish talent for treading on “comrades’ ”
corns, topped the Sydney poll with 6304 pri-
mary votes out of 38,102. This time, stand-
ing without a party nomination, he got only
1346 out of 35,154, which shows how little
a man matters in Labor politics. Paddy
Minahan, who lias been an M.L.A., off and
on, since the century was in its infancy, was
another casualty in Sydney. Paddy and
Gregory were the two wealthiest N.S.W.
Labor politicians, and if Paddy withdraws
his contributions, as Gregory lias done, “the
movement” will feel it.
Labor-man It. V. Keane gave Frank
Clarke a scare in the •Melbourne South Leg.
Council election. He was 609 votes ahead
in the first count, but was beaten by 620
on the allocation of the third candidate’s
ballot-papers. Now Labor claims that but for
the disfranchisement of seven or eight hundred
tenants it would have won. These people
would have been qualified if their landlords
had not neglected to pay the municipal rates.
It is improbable that the Labor man would
have got all the votes in question, but a sys-
tem which admits of electors being cheated
of their rights in this way shrieks for remedy.
George Buchanan, the imported harbor
expert, after an inspection of the Clarence
River (northern N.S.W.), stated that, he had
faith in decentralisation and small ports;
in fact, there could hardly be too many
ports. He added that it was quite possible
to provide 30ft. of water at Grafton,
miles up river from Clarence Heads, if the
Government would find the money. But this
only added fuel to the fire of local discontent,
for the conviction, based on past experience,
is that the Sydney Government won’t find
the money, and won't permit a local harbor
trust to exist, and won't connect Grafton
with its natural hinterland, and won’t let
Private Enterprise do that or anything else.
In short, the Northerners are assured that
they have a bis: asset; but there is no
visible way of making anything out of it
save by secession.
“X.N.0.” : It is patent that some contri-
bution to Empire naval defence is required
from Australia, but opinions differ as to
whether that contribution should take the
form of ships or a base, the provision of
ships in the latter case being left to Eng-
land. Admiral Cresswell, in an interview,
recently stressed the urgency of developing
Australia’s navy, evidently in reply to a
pronouncement by Admiral Guy Gaunt,
who roundly condemned the Australian
as being by temperament unfitted to
make a good sailor. But Gaunt didn’t sug-
gest any other form of contribution if the
R.A.N. were abolished; and in any case, the
opinion of Captain A. G. Craufurd, D. 5.0.,
lately in charge of Garden Island, may
be taken as more reliable. Craufurd told
the writer a few days before he left for
England that, contrary to his expectation
when he accepted the Garden island appoint-
ment, the Australian bluejacket was every
bit as good as his English prototype.
At an early stage of the Tas. election
scrutiny Premier Lyons said that, if* his
Government failed to get a party majority, it
would carry on with the aid of those Nation-
alist members who had kept it in office last
year. What he should have said was that
he would be willing to lead an Elective Min-
istry, the Speck being sorely in need of a
Government composed of the best adminis-
trative talent in sight. The need for such
a Ministry remains, though Labor has been
returned with a small majority. Incidentally,
an interesting proposal for an Elective Minis
try was submitted to the Speck’s Leg. Coun-
cil last year by Edwards, M.L.C., only to be
flattened out by 18 votes to. 4. But the
Council was so snakeheaded in those days
that it would have rejected the Sermon on
the Mount had it been presented in the form
of a bill.
In spite of what the cables allege it is
Safe to say that no Bolshevik gold was
needed to create the present disturbance m
China. The Chinaman failed to fall in love
with the foreigner when he first saw him,
and the introduction of Western industrial-
ism which desti’oyed millions of little com-
munal factories and put Shanghai, Tientsin
and Hankow in their place, has not tended
to enlarge his affection. Nevertheless, Soviet
agents have undoubtedly done their best to
help on the bad work, and the Soviet can be
trusted to look for any of the pears that get
shaken down in the course of the typhoon
that appears to be impending. That . Mos-
cow intends to back East against West in the
affair is shown by the fact that Comrade
Karakhan, although doyen of the foreign
legations in Peking, sent a private message
of Soviet sympathy with the victims of the
Shanghai riot to the Chinese Government,
and that the Soviet is not associated with the
other powers in the delegation sent to
Shanghai to clear things up.
Several Vic. Cocky members are so dis-
gruntled with one thing and another that
they would not care tuppence if Premier
John Allan were displaced : they would prefer
to be back in the Ministerial corner, holding
the balance of power and playing off Liberal-
ism against Labor. Solidarity is a term
which has no meaning for the F.U. group.
It finds it difficult to be true to itself, so how
can it be loyal to a coalition?
The unusual is always expected from
Broken Hill, so that no commotion was
made when Charles Dooley, an Independent
candidate for Sturt, included in his platform
the plank “Licensed harlots —Small fee.'
That he was given only 20 No. 1 votes in
his home town and only an odd one or two
out back proves he was not taken seriously:
but sometimes one wonders how. much of a
kink a man must have before his eligibility
for Parliament is lost.
The new broadcasting station for which
Sydney Trades and Labor Council has
obtained a license is stated to be the first of
its kind in the world, and is the forerunner
of an interlocking series. Labor news, lec-
tures, debates and music are to be dispensed,
and a break-in-system, operated with an auto-
matic Morse key, will enable the station to
communicate with Europe and America. All
no doubt part of the equipment of the revolu-
tion which Comrade Garden proposes to take
over when the glad day comes.
The TJ.S. Supreme Court has given a deci-
sion that seems as full of possible ti-ouble
as a Mills bomb. It has ruled that an
American-born Japanese, even though he
served in the war with the IT.S. Expedition-
ary Force, cannot become a citizen ot
Coolidge’s country. The publication of th '
judgment at the very moment of the U.S.
Navy’s Pacific excursion would seem almost
the limit in tactlessness. The absolute record
must go to the American newspaper
which points out that, as a result of the
Court’s finding, citizenship can only be ew
tended “to persons of white and black races.
“Bildad” : In a recent burst of exaltation.
Prime Minister Bruce said that Australia
“had developed its roads aud railways at an
incomparable rate,” wherefore “roads now
led to every part of the Commonwealth, and
the mileage of its railways was equal to that
of Great Britain.” Yet in one of the oldest
States, and 200 or 200 miles from Melbourne,
lies HOBO square miles of unknown land for
which the Statistician makes apology. He
can supply no rainfall returns, because no
one ever got there with a rain-gauge and
returned alive. There is nothing disgrace-
ful about this, to my knowledge, but it
tends to make the P.M. look ridiculous.

“Pedro” on the days that were:—
I have read some regretful remarks about the
passing of the old glories of election time in
Sydney. And truly it was an ebullient season up
to 30-odd years ago. I am old enough to re-
WORKED FOR IT.
“Yes, he told me his wife is always kissing
him when she wants money."
“That accounts; she told me she cams every
penny she yets."
member the candidates in top-hats bawling bom
hotel balconies, the “committee rooms” in promiscu-
ous places whence men issued throughout the day
wiping their mouths, the fist- and foot-fights >n
the streets, the paid buttoners flourishing mostly
bogus lists of sure voters for their candidates, and
all” the rest of it. Arid on election day itself all
the pubs open and thronged, and most of the
shops with their shutters up, the whole city a gasp-
ing orgasm, and the best part of the male popula-
tion congenially tight. Also the hustings, that
stimulating symbol of benefit' public excitement.
The last of these sturdy temples of democracy was
built in Hyde Park for an East Sydney shindy of
the very early ’nineties, in which F.dward Pulsfor 1
battled tor Freetrader Walter Bradley (who won)
for Protection, and Fn.uk Cotton for the Labor
party that was just about to be. The .returning-
officer, the proposers and seconders of candidates, anc!
the candidates themselves each and all spoke and
there was another round of gab, after a show of hands
had been taken and a poll demanded, over a vote
of thanks to the returning-officer. Old John
Robertson was picturesquely present, threatening an
enthusiast who was taunting some of the crowd
that he would “throw him over the balcony
if he didn’t well shut up.” We were there
three or four hours, and the bulk of the crowd
made a day of it. In comparison, an election to-day
is as exciting as an empty morgue, and Sydney a
place where, as the disgusted western visitor said
of the eastern town, respectability stalks unchecked.
* * * *
“C. City": Even vote-chasing lias its
humors, as I found out while doing a bit of
canvassing in my own very quiet, very re-
spectable, very apathetic Sydney suburb. 1
had had a good run during the evening and
was' feeling in first-rate fettle despite wot
leet. a cold in the head and certain keen re-
minders of my rheumatic knee. Thus it was
l approached one front door and m due
course addressed the lady of the house on
the need of recording her vote. “I don t
think I will vote,” says she. W ltli great
histrionic zeal I showed symptoms of amaze-
ment and concern, and proceeded with a mild
opening of persuasion. With head on one
side and lips well parsed up, my lady ironed
me out. “I will not vote, quoth she. ft
von people thought more about your Maker
•and less about your Parliaments, you would
be better off.” The two switches for the
front verandah and front hall clicked off as
the door was very quietly but very firmly
shut, and I was left a thoroughly pulped
mortal in the cold damp night.
* * * *
“Bamahoota”: A picker-up of uncon-
sidered trifles struck something that must
have been new in his experience the other
day. A lady, living on the North Shore
(Sydney), owned a Pomeranian which sick-
ened and died. Much upset at her pet s
death, and suspecting poison, the owner
decided to bring the body to Sydney and get
a vet. to settle the question. With the
deceased wrapped up in a neat brown paper
parcel, she set off for the city. Arriving at
the wharf, she was just about to board the
ferry, when an amiable gent, at her elbow
begged her to “allow him” (as he took the
parcel) to facilitate her passage across a
particularly insecure-looking gangway. She
thanked him for his courtesy, and walked
on to the boat: but when she turned to re-
possess herself of her property she found
the obliging stranger had vanished. I should
like to have seen his face when he investi-
gated his stolen goods.
“T.P.": A contractor and certain laborers
who once worked in the Melbourne Gaol
could corroborate a
recent Statement in
The Bulletin
that burial in
quick-lime is more
likely to preserve a
corpse than to de-
stroy it. It was at
the time when the
gaol was sewered.
One of the shafts
was sunk at the
spot where Ned
Kelly was interred,
and the remains
were found -ntact.
T h e contractor,
fearing a scandal,
caused the hole to
be tilled hurriedly
with concrete, and another sunk a little dis-
tance from the spot.
“Hcrodot” : Paragraphs about determined
suicides recall another class: those whose
views undergo a complete change after the
first step is taken. I remember a young
married woman, whose husband had left liei
after a disagreement, being brought into our
Melbourne hospital. Thoroughly convinced
that life had nothing more to offer her, she
set all her affairs in order, wrote several
farewell letters, and drank a large quantity
of rat-poison. Discovered in time, she was
hurried to the hospital, where the doctor
on duty happened to be one of her own sex.
In the casualty-room the patient filled the
air with her lamentations, beseeching the
doctor to get a move on and save her life.
It was duly saved, but the patient was so

“Ilasen”: The little party (mixed) of the
“younger set” that likes to be labelled
“advanced” and “daring” was frankly dis-
cussing love, divorce, incompatibility and so
on. Only the simple-seeming youth in the
corner remained silent. At last lie too spoke.
“I happen to know,” said the simple young
man. “that my father was faced by a pro-
blem of that sort. My father had the artis-
lie temperament, though I have heard he
didn’t have it very badly until, as a young
man, he made a trip to Paris. He had known
my mother before that as a jolly girl, ami
when he returned found her more jolly still
and verv beautiful. They seemed to come
together'naturally, and, for a time, my father
forgot all about the artistic side of his
nature. In fact, it was only a few days
before they were to be married that he
remembered it. At the same time lie made
the appalling discovery that my mother had
THE COMFORTER.
“She said I'm too old and ugly ever to attract a man."
"My dear, she’s a pig—people who blurt, things out like that hare,
no manners!”
no artistic sense whatsoever; even more, that
she jeered at those with pretensions to it.
Indeed, it was made horribly plain to him
that in things of the mind and they
really had nothing in common, and that”... .
“Then,” broke in decisively a bright-cheeked
maid beside him, “late as it was, he shouldn't
have gone on with it.” “No,” confirmed an-
other. “It was a crime against love. Avhat-
cver the cost, he shouldii t have mar ried
her.” “He didn’t,” the .simple young man
said simply. And there was silence.

“M.” on a page of early history
There is a good deal of mystery, and some conflict
of figures and dates, about the English seamen who
(vide “M.G.S.” B. 14/5/’25) found graves in Aus-
tralia a century and a half before Forbes Sutherland.
In July, 1622, two boats carrying 46 men reached
Batavia and reported that they formed part of the
crew of an English ship, the Trial, that had piled
up on what have since been identified as the Monte
Bello reefs, lying west of the Dampier Archipelago
and north of Barrow Island. The
men said the rest of the crew,
numbering 97, had been left behind,
and of these derelicts we know no
more than that they were never re-
ported as having turned up at any-
civilised port, and that the Batavians
didn’t attempt their rescue. The
wrecked craft wasn’t a British man-
o'-war, and a merchantman would
hardly have carried a crew of such
a size on a legitimate trading voyage,
so the presumption is that she was on
a piratical cruise. There isn’t a scrap
of evidence that the 97 men referred
to, presuming they really existed,
reached the Australian mainland and
ultimately found graves there. Some
of them may have done so, but it :s
more likely that, if they contrived to
leave the scene of the wreck at all,
they made for Batavia in the track, of their mates
and encountered Davy Jones on the way.

“Caesar” : “Albatross” asks if there is
anything in palmistry (B. 21/5/25). A
bushman at Esk (Q.) show thought there

would be killed by being thrown Horn his
horse while riding home that night. lln*

“Ex-Englishman": The cable talks fool-
ishly when it describes the case of a woman,
found dead with two empty eucalyptus-
bottles beside her, as the first fatality m
England from that cause. It may be the
first suicide. I remember well that about
85 years ago, when the “Russian influenza"
first found out Britain, and Britain first-
found out the virtues of the dinkurn oil, the
public, accustomed to taking its remedies in
generous tablespoonfuls, could not grasp at
first the 5-or-10-drops idea. There were
three deaths within a short space, and at
the third the Coroner's jury actually made
a recommendation that this new and deadly
drug should be added to the list of poisons.

“W. J. Digger”: The local undertaker’s
lady, in her capacity of Mayoress, had in-
vited the elite to meet a distinguished visitor
to the district, and,
after tea had been

her side. “ ’Avc

“T.P.”: The yarn of the restaurant patron

me of an episode in my father’s courtship of
mother —naturally I speak from hearsay. He
was r. Cousin Jack and she a Yorkshire girl,
and when matters had gone far enough she
took him on visits to her relations for scru-
tiny and approval. At one house dinner
opened with plum pudding. “Sensible
people,” thought my dad; “something’s gone
wrong with the meat, and they are saying
nothing.” He made a meal of that plum
pudding, stolidly ignoring signals of warning
from the bride-elect. When there wasn t a
single unfilled corner in his anatomy, a royal
sirloin of beef with good solid Yorkshire
pudding was produced with the solemnity
with which a haggis is borne to an cxpec-

CHRYSANTHEMUM DAYS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a touch of frost in the air to-night,
And Brisbane wraps her in cloak of blue.
With a glittering trimming of orange light
Stabbing her cloudy twilight through.
Still loiters sunset among the hills,
With a hint of day cn the loftiest spot—
A pale sky-pool that with darkness fills,
And a shelving shingle of apricot.
Ragged heads o’er the clipped lawn showing,
Evening turns you to toneless dun;
But I know that the dawn will find you glowing
In a blaze of pride to the morning sun.
Chrysanthemums ! Ah, you freakish fellows!
Doublets brown that are slashed with gold !
Pure warm white, and high clarion yellows.
And a mulberry colored with silver fold!
Your faint, fresh smell is like new-mown grasses.
Time treads you with his ruthless feet;
The languid rose in her beauty passes,
Till you own the gardens all down the street.
For chrysanthemums are the hardy fellows —
They shake the rain from their tousled heads,
Or doze in shade as the sharp day mellows
And the wind retreats from the garden beds.
.Oh, turn your calendar neatly over—
You must date your Aprils and mark your May*:
But unhelped you will know that' ’tis Spring brings
clover,
And that June is filled with chrysanthemum days.
QUEENSLAND.

“Mephisto ’: “Harold Hardupp” (B.
28/5/’25) mentions gas bath-lieaters as
potential deathtraps. There is another dan-
gerous element in the bathroom, and that is
electricity. If the contractor knows his job,
the exposed portion of the bathroom light-
switch will consist of porcelain. This does
its best to prevent a current being earthed
through the body of the operator. Never-
theless, current may leak through, and the re-
sult may be painful, if not disastrous. Sen-
sible people will dry themselves before switch-
ing the light on or off, as the electrical con-
ductivity of the body is greatly increased
when it is wet. One should never use the
•switch when standing in a bath of water.
Of course, if everything is in good order
there will be no harmful results, but elec
tricity is a ticklish thing to deal with.

“T. 0.1.”: The Paddington (Sydney)
Municipal Council has decided to preserve
the ancient pump which stands on the main
road outside the barrack wall. It was erected
in 1852, and gave the first water supply for
Paddington and Surry Hills. In 1870 water
from the city mains reached Paddington;
three years later the old pump found its
occupation gone. For close on 30 years it
had served the wants of Imperial regiments
stationed in the barracks, the last being the
18th Royal Irish.

THE HARDEST CUT OF ALL.

the second edition of “Butler’s Geography,'’
compiled by Samuel Butler, D.D., head-
master of the Royal Free Grammar School,
Shrewsbury, and published in 1813. The
only N.S.W. mentioned therein is described
as being above “Upper Canada,” and “on
the western side of Hudson’s Bay.” Australia
is not mentioned at all under that name,
but New Holland figures among “the princi-
pal Asiatic islands,” which include Ceylon
and the islands of Japan. The Rev. Samuel
adds that New Holland is “an immense
island, which some geographers dignify with
the appellation of another continent, under
the title of Notasia.” This is the only time
I have seen “Notasia” (? Not Asia) in print.

“XD": The wide advertisement given to
the Melbourne police patrols has led to de-
mands for then-
services against
which the John
Hops are protest-
ing. An urgent
message about a
woman being mur-
dered was wire-
lessed the other
night to a patrol,
which dashed 10
miles to the scene
of the tragedy, only
to find a lady who
had obviously got
the best of a domes-
tic argument and
a gentleman who
had just as obvi-
ously got the worst
of it. The victor
had called for the
police patrol, it
appeared, merely to
witness the beaten
male’s complete dis-
comfiture, and ap-
peared to regard it
as preposterous
that the patrol
should be annoyed
with her. In an-
other case an
urgent application
for police assist-
ance was received
at the station, and
duly forwarded to
the patrol, from a
mother who wanted
to frighten her 15-
year-old son into
staying at home in-
stead of going to
the “pitchers.” She
had intended, she
explained, to give
a second ring to
police headquarters
which would ex-
plain the position
after the one that
was merely in-
tended to scare dis-
obedience out of
the boy; but other
things claimed her
attention, and the
matter was over-
looked. The police are trying to keep
their tempers, but they hint darkly that some
of these frivolous calls may presently lead
to charges of obstructing the force in the
performance of its duty.

“M.H.” : Touching police-court oaths, the
most picturesque I have heard administered
was in Borneo. “I swear,” said the Dusun
witness, “by Ivenharingan above, and by the
Earth God, that ' I will speak the truth.
If I do not, may a crocodile seize me as T
cross a river, may my padi [rice], wither and
a tree fall on me in the jungle.

“Machete”: The theory that “snuff-
dippers” practised that form of taking the dust
because of the cocaine in it (B. 28/5/’25)
won’t hold water. “Dipping,” plus gum-
rubbing, had been practised for many a
year in Ireland and Scotland before cocaine
was heard of in those parts. Even when
the alkaloid became known it was an expen-
sive luxury; snuff mixed with it would be
too gilt-edged a proposition for. the gaffers
and crones addicted to the habit. “Dipping”
is also a long-established habit with Ken-
tucky and Virginian mountaineers, as well
as other “poor whites” in Uncle Sam’s coun-
try. It is referred to in “Huckleberry Finn,”
while Mary Johnston and other writers who
know their period introduce it in stories
dealing with the Civil War. The “poor
white” mountaineers made, and still make,
their own snuff from home-grown tobacco,
as they make moonshine whisky from maize.
Where could these people get money to buy
cocaine, even if they ever heard of it?
* * * *
“Hamer” : The frequency with which de-
serted and seemingly ownerless motor-cars
are discovered is puzzling the Melbourne
police. It is conceded that the owner of
an uninsured ear may feel little further in-
terest in his property after it has been badly
damaged by an accident; but the perfectly
undamaged cars that are constantly reported
provide no clear reason for desertion. The
other day a conveyance -which had been
standing in a right-of-way off Toorak-road
for a fortnight was reported by a local shop-
keeper : all that could be discovered was that
it had been registered by a man with a St.
Kilda address seven months ago, but the
registration had not been renewed, the origi-
nal owner had disappeared, and no other
came forward with a claim. A man who
recently claimed a car the police had had
on their hands for several weeks gave a
novel reason for his dilatoriness. He
admitted having been very drunk, and went
on to recount how he had been jolted into
sobriety by the idea that he had run over
and killed a man. Thereupon, he said, lie ran
A WORTHY JUDGE.
"Isn’t it splendid, dear —the Judge has given me four pounds a
week alimony! It’s so fine for a woman to feel that she
isn’t dependent on a man for her funds.”
his car on to a vacant allotment and bolted to
Adelaide; but, after assuring himself
through the inquiries of agents that there
was no corpse for which he could be held
responsible, he returned. A curious John
Hop, who heard the story, discovered a
rasped and damaged post, showing marks
which might have been made by the mud-
guard of this man’s car, the post being about
a hundred yards from the allotment where
the car was found. Apparently a partial
collision with the inanimate object had
filled the motor-driver’s mind with tribula
tion for weeks; and the man who recklessly
drives a car when drunk is lucky if he
escapes with nothing worse.
They made no bones about their
abhorrence of high treason in Maoriland a
little over 50 years ago. The formula that
a prisoner found guilty of the crime of
murder “be taken to the place of execution
and there hanged by the neck until he is
dead” had no terrors for the Maori wrong-
doer. In the ’sixties, however, Justice John-
ston put the wind up the natives well and
truly: he ordered his prisoner, found guilty
ot high treason, “to be drawn on a hurdle
to the place of execution, to be there hanged
by the neck till dead, and afterwards the
head to be severed from the body, the body
to be divided into four quarters, which may
afterwards be disposed of according to law.”
1 oor of the logical sense, but rich in the
spiritual, Rangi thought that when his head
was chopped off and the rest of his person
disposed of according to law,” it meanr
good-bye to his chance of ever being able to
join his dear papa in the spiritual land of
Ins fathers.

“Ex-Dig.”: There is a woman now lying
in Sydney Hospital whose chest was opened
up in order to expose her heart, from which
a hydatid cyst was removed. The step for-
ward in surgical science that made opera-
tion possible was directly due to the war.
Tt was an Australian doctor who, at Cam-
bridge, lighted the new path by removing a
bullet from the heart of a patient. There
were at least two other such cases in the
A.1.F., each subject recovering; and there
was actually one instance in which an Aus-
tralian medical officer in a military hospital
in 1' ranee opened the. chest of a man who
lunl “died” under an anaesthetic whilst under-
going a leg-amputation, and, by pulsing Un-
heart, restored life for 18 hours. At the end
of that time the patient really and truly
died, mortification having set in in the
wounded leg. A similar method of reviving
the dead has been tried since, and life has
been restored for periods ranging up to
tour days—sufficient to give some hope of
better success when the operation of pulsing
the heart follows immediately upon the cessa-
tion of its beating.

“T.A.”: “The roughest spin I ever had at
the war?” said Bleary reflectively as wo
were yarning around the camp-fire. “Well.
I'll tell you. We’d been relieved and marched
all night back for a rest without water or
tucker. Dry? I’d have licked the grass only
there was none. We lobbed into camp about
9 a.m., but found we hadn’t been expected
till next day. There were no rations,
but some of us got leave to go to the nearest
village, 23 kilos away. I was in front, and
I made the pace a welter to the only pub
in it. I was just turning the door-knob when
Fritzy sent over a Jack Johnson and blew
the pub clean out of my hand, straight! I
was wounded after that three times, and
nearly killed once, but that was the stiffest
thing that ever happened to me.”

“Tarago”: In the matter of sticking to
the trail, the field post-office put up some
fine performances. Early in 1936 a letter
was directed to me from Carnal, Pa., U.S.A.
On reaching my Australian address it was
re-directed with the comprehensive inscrip-
tion, “Active service abroad,” and started
on its travels. I had left Egypt before it
arrived there, so it lit out for Marseilles,
and chased me across France into Belgium
Thence it crossed to England, and after a
pause to pick up my tracks in London, re-
crossed the Channel, and went through
Northern France to Ypres. There it got a
new direction. “In hospital.” Turning back

it nosed through the C.C.S.’s and hospitals,
got on a definite trail at Rouen, and followed
it through Birmingham, Hartford and tin
con. camps in Weymouth. About this time
it was re-labelled “Australia,” and finally
ran me to earth at the original address after
3 2 months’ travelling.
THE IRRESISTIBLE PLEA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I have been suffering from indigestion and want
my wife to come back and cook for me,’ was the
plea put forward in the Divorce Court yesterday.”
Come back to me, because I love you so
And life bereft of you is misery;
The days in dismal sequence come and go;
Each dawn is sorrow and each night is woe
For love’s sweet sake come back and comfort me!
(No response.)
Come back to me—our little children cry
(Our John and James and Jane and Emily) ;
Nought but a mother’s love can hope to dry
Their bitter tears —oh ! strive not to deny
The call of motherhood, but come to me!
(Nothing doing.)
Come back to me and I will be your slave
And, going before you on a humble knee,
Your pride with utter self-abasement lave,
And that rare smile of your forgiveness crave—
Oh come as queen and conqueror back to me!
(Another blank.)
Come back to me! In dire despair I sing
Into your cruel ear my final plea ;
My stomach suffers from the barbed sting
Of ill-cooked meals and aches like anything.
V our neat deft hands alone can comfort bring
With dainty snacks to soothe its suffering °
For dear digestion’s sake come back to me!

A SONG OF FRIED SAUSAGES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“She seemed to do what she liked. The only
meal she ever prepared for her husband appeared
to be sausages.” —Evidence in matrimonial squabbl'
When the feast of young love has diminished'
Its lure, and the prosy days come,
Wakes the struggle that seldom is finished
As to who’s to be boss of the home.
The food that’s withheld or presented
May a wonderful difference make;
For he who’s with sausage contented
Will never be fattened on steak.
There’s a musical sound in their splutter
As, frying, the sausages sing;
But it drops to an ominous mutter,
When that song’s a monotonous thing,
Of a plot to lay hold of the bossage—■
On to this, if you’re wise, you will drop ;
For the man who’s contented with sausage
Will find that his life is no chop.
Though slight be your care of your feeding,
Ye ’grooms who love freedom, beware
Lest the traps set at meal-time are leading
To a life of meek serfdom and care.
If your bride shows the habit, correct her,
Ere the sausage-links grip like a chain,
And the frying-pan stands as a spectre,
To lay which you’ll struggle in vain.

Evidently some of the shareholders have been
asking for more. At the annual meeting m
London in April—accounts closed in Octobei,
1924, but it takes seven months before de-
tails complete the round voyage back to Aus-
tralia—the chairman advocated caution.
‘‘The directors do not consider the present
position sufficiently stable to justify them
in making any increase |.in div.] at present.
But he ended on a hopeful note: You may
rest assured that the claims of the share-
holders will be recognised as soon as we arc
reasonably satisfied that any increase can
be maintained.” It was one of the few
points in a long speech which won articulate
endorsement from the meeting. The market,
price of the scrip is very high (the yield js
a shade under 5 p.c.) ; but as that lias char-
acterised quotations for years, it is difficult
to say whether shareholders take the chair-
man’s vague promise seriously. At any rate
a change for the worse in the div. seems
most unlikely. Further, the causes men-
tioned as reasons for merely standing pat
have been modified by happenings since the
meeting. “We have a very large accumu-
lation of funds in London which it is essen-
tial for the prosperity of our business to get
back to Australia, and the cost of effecting
that transfer will certainly be heavy.” A
month later Winston Churchill had an-
nounced the return to the gold basis and the
problem of the bloated balances had been
settled overnight. The wool position was
advanced as another reason; but although
the sudden drop following the phenomenal
levels of the opening series, the dead market
since, and the action of the selling brokers
in suspending sales have combined to make
uncertainty, and while it may be accepted
that prices have definitely deserted the re-
cord heights, it may also be accepted that
they will continue highly remunerative.
The year's admitted gross profits were a
little less than they had been lately:—

But the substantial decrease (£26,248) in
taxation was more than a set-off to the
diminution in gross earnings. Despite The
decrease, taxes claimed more than one-htth
of gross profits compared with about one-
fourteenth in the pre-war year. Expenses,
meantime, have climbed high, too -partly
due to the extension of the bank’s activities,
partly to wage increases under Arbitration
awards. However, after paying the usual
13 p.c. div., £25,000 was written off premises
and £84.004 added to visible reserves. De-
spite that, premises increased £17,045—a
ridiculously small amount, though, consider-
ing- the acquisitions. Premises which house
the bank in most of its 200 branches m the
Australasian capitals and lesser centres stand
in the books at £47,351. They are worth
well over a million, and that is a splendid
inner reserve, more particularly since the
principal offices are fine buildings and splen-
did letting propositions.
Here is a comparison of balance-sheet
movements: —

To him that hath shall be given: deposits
increased by £658,025. Better even than the
bare figure is the fact that they were chiefly
fixed deposits which the noted solidity of the
attracts in competition with liighei-
,t£ed gSt edged securities. .Free deposits
were somewhat lower, except in Queensland
Movements in the assets exemplify c < 1
the trouble the banks were m over exchange
during the latter part of the period covered
hv the accounts. The necessity foi fund.,
to finance exports compelled the banks to
restrict advances —which accounts foi the
decrease of £1,600,000 And, though that
call is to a great extent over, the banks aie
still keeping a tight rein on advances, lucre
is a pretty general feeling among them tl at
the cities have over-built; fuithei. the n
tense competition of foreign lactones m:i ves
hank Boards disinclined to give much help
to home industries until they arc better pro-
tected ; and as for Queensland, the low price
of sugar in the world's market (we can
figure on only about £9 10s. to £lO per ton,
has caused apprehensions in that quarter.
The ’Asia’s big div. is a delusion, issues of
new capital over the past 12 years having
been at heavy premiums. Actually last year s
div. was equal to little more than 6s P-c.
on total shareholders' funds, a.
October 5 last amounted to £3l ,<92 591, of
which £15,488,034 was represented by
liquids—a very high percentage, due of
course, to the necessities which werw the_i
reaching their zenith. That left £16,304,00<
to be covered by advances with a book value
of £24,347,537 and the premises, lhe bank s
own funds visible were £1,830,302, so it
was holding only £4 Is. of the public s money
for each £ of its own. It is a position ot
extraordinary strength.
#
The Primary Producers’ Bank of Aus-
tralia, Ltd.: —The P.I J . was fortunate in
striking in its second term a phenomenally
rich patch: record wool yields and prices
and opulent wheat, sugar and maize crops.
To that it owed much —perhaps most ot the
all-round increase which the year shows.
But although the operations exhibit remark-
able expansion, it is a rare optimist who
will hold that the concern is now firmly
established. All one can say is that this
comparison suggests that it has its teet on
the path;- 1924 . 1925 .

The increase of £614,765 in subscribed capi-
tal shows that remarkable success attended
the share-selling campaign. Shares are of
£5 called to £l, but bear a premium of £1
to cover the cost of establishing branches.
To February 28 premiums had been more
than sufficient to the extent of £79,603, that
representing the surplus amount, which was
placed to reserve. The idea of meeting estab-
lishment charges without making inroads on
capital is excellent; time alone will prove
whether the stiff share premium imposed for
the purpose was justifiable. When outstand-
ing calls are in, paid capital will be well
over £400,060. In the past 12 months the
increase was £112,500. As the addition to
premium reserve was £46.210, it is plain that
establishment and development and share-
selling charges for the year absorbed £66,2.10.
The bank may plead that in stating the
bare balance in P. and L. it is merely fol-
lowing practice. Nevertheless the fact that
exes, are met out of premiums as well as
out of revenue makes some details neces-
sary if shareholders are to judge the posi-
tion ; and such are not given. It is impos-
sible to estimate how much expenditure is
really developmental and how much is
inseparable from the conduct of the bank.
Any calculation must be arbitrary. Criti-
cism of the accounts is thereby rendered diffi-
cult; and the P. and L. balance of £3124
shown may mean little or nothing. If the
establishment has borne, less than ;i fair
charge, profit will have been greater; if the
management erred the other way there may
have been a loss. So far the amount re-
ceived in premiums has been more than
ample: assuming premiums equivalent to
paid capital, then formation, establishment
and development to date have mopped up
£159,156 apart from ordinary expenditure.
Profits are not looked for in a bank in its
second year, particularly in this the first
private venture since the ’nineties; and a
venture taken, too, in competition with in-
stitutions of undoubted, not to say remark-
able, strength. With the assistance of that
£189.156 something better than the £976 and
£3124 “profits” might have been expected.
But three factors operated, and will continue
to operate: —
Some, if not many, of tlie branches must inevit-
ably be burdens over a period, and non-profit- or
poor profit-winners for a further period. The share-
selling campaign quite as inexorably will force die
Bank to continue its expansion; 15 new branches
were opened during the term and further branches
are to be opened within the next month or so. The
institution will not be allowed to rest on its oars:
development costs must continue heavy. These, jt
course, will be, or should be, offset as branches,'
earlier established, become profit-earners.
The fact that depositors get 2 p.c. interest on
current balances necessarily limits profits. Taka
balances of free deposits as averaging £300,000 for
the full 12 months; then £6OOO went in interest.
And £6OOO would represent almost a 3 p.c. div.
on the mean of the capital. That must operate so
long as the present practice is maintained and it
must be a serious drag on profits. On the other
ln.nd, inasmuch as depositors will probably be in
most cases shareholders, they may be content with
small divs., evening up the return with the interest.
The point arises as to whether the bank will main-
tain this practice. (It "has dispensed with the
10s. bank charge, but that is a lesser matter.) While
the practice of paying interest on current balances is
common in some parts of the world, only a couple
of lesser institutions in Australia follow it, and
the P.P. may ultimately have to decide, as others
have done, that the innovation, having served ts
purpose, should be relinquished.
The other factor, also likely to remain an in-
fluence for some time, is the necessity the Bank
will be under to maintain a big percentage of its
assets liquid, which necessarily will restrict its
advances and thus limit its profit earning.
The balance-sheet position looks very
strong; 62.8 p.c. of the liabilities were repre-
sented by liquids—a ratio greatly in excess
of what ordinarily is considered adequate.
In this the P.P. is not actuated by conserva-
tive motives alone—it is forced to provide
against possibilities in case the other trading
banks, from necessity or choice, should re-
fuse assistance. . In the first year the per-
centage was 80.4.
Outside liabilities on Feb. 28 amounted to
£1,076,034. Included in that was an un-
specified amount for contingencies; but not
much notice need be taken of that. De-
positors are well protected by the liquid
nature of assets (a further £BO,OOO has been
placed in Commonwealth stock since the
close of the accounts) and the public can
see £1 6s. 7d. for every £1 of its money and
shareholders can see net tangible assets of
£1 ss. lOd. for each £1 of paid capital: and
there has been a “heavy writing down” of
safes and fittings. The matter of divs. lies
somewhere in the future. The Board will
do well if it resists temptation or pressure
to even think of such things until the drain
upon the Establishment Fund ceases.

The Corp.’s charges are controlled by law.
In November last they had to stand exami-
nation by a Royal Commission; but Justice
Campbell was. satisfied that the cost did not
show a reduction of at least one-tenth of a
penny per unit, so there was no reduction
in price. Incidentally, it cost the co. over
£l2OO to establish its case. However, profits
could stand it—they were easily a record.
The Board took the opportunity to write off
a heavier amount than hitherto, and there
are grounds for suspecting that it is being
done on a liberal scale; probably a trifle
of true profit is bound up in the £116.791
which stood on April 30 as provision for de-
preciation of plant and machinery. These
figures explain the expansion in profits: —

1924 . . 15,032 147,086 78,533
1925 .. 17,311 167,592 84,950
A gratifying aspect is the relatively, small
increase in working exes. The liquidation
of the debenture debt meant that most of the
interest item (£2750 in 1924) disappeared.
A record increase was notched in the matter
of new consumers, and as the co.’s franchises
still have from 17 to 42 years to run there is
time and room for substantial expansion.
Present plant which was added to recently
can meet a heavy increase in demand for
current. The municipalities served, by the
way, are protected: the Corp. is under bond
to give them treatment no worse than that
accorded by the City Council to. its cus-
tomers ; and, as the City Council isn’t out
after dividends, that amounts to a substan-
tial check.
Last year shareholders were offered at par
150,000' shares, but only Bs. 6d. has been
called, and there will be no further call until
December 1. The additional capital altered
balance-sheet figures:—
1911. 1921. 1924. 1925.

Book debts .. 92 L 15,403 21,790 13,956
Cash, etc. .. 17 15,868 12,913 1,810
The increase in fixed assets (£52,086) was
chiefly in mains and meters connected with
service to new consumers, only £3OOO being
added to plant.
Starting over 17 years ago, a special Act
gave the co. rights to sell electricity in Bal-
main in return for relieving the municipality
of its garbage-destruction troubles. It soon
added four more municipalities, but its
further spread is prevented by the City Light-
ing Department’s control of supplies to the
surrounding areas. However, half of the
residences and premises in the areas served
have yet to be won to electricity, and there
is. in addition, the natural growth of popu-
lation. There is not likely to be any inter-
ference with the Corp. so long as it con-
ducts itself as well as in the past. But share-
holders cannot safely look for more than
10 p.c.

A 25 p.c. increase in gross profits is a hint
that the co. did its share towards the record
coal-production of 1924. And the output
since has probably been on the same scale,
for the period lias not been marred by any-
thing worse than the usual irritating inci-
dents which disturb the coal industry. There
have been greater profits, but ordinaries have
only once before had such a dividend. T’refs.
received 15 p.c. Their .usual is 121 p.c.,
and from that it may be guessed the co. was
in a tight corner once. Indeed, its career
was very nearly ended at the beginning of
the century, when some of the prefs. wanted
liquidation. The co. had worked out its
Newcastle properties without accumulating
a fund to repay capital, when there no
longer was workable coal in the mine. Mat-
ters were almost desperate, when an area
at Neath was obtained, and the output from
that rich spot on the Maitland field allowed
the co. to quickly pay off arrears of prof,
divs. and replace ordinaries on the div. list.
There was, however, a long wait, and the
latter had no div. from 1901 to 1912. In
addition to the Cessnock mine, Kalingo has
been acouired, and is in the development
stage. Since 1.920 the provision for depre-
ciation has not been specified; in the cir-
cumstances, the conclusion to draw is that
it has been too much rather than too little.
Up to 1924 it was possible to see something
of the co.’s position ; but the Board decided
that less information should he given, and
so the balance-sheet has changed. Still, the
following comparison may he of value: —
1924. 1925.

The taxation reserve of £lO,OOO has dis-
appeared, and is buried in “sundry creditors
and provision for taxation.” Whether any
true profits are hidden there can only be
guessed at. In the introductory table the
reserves now include tlic general reserve,
the div. equalisation reserve (including the
appropriations from P. and L.) and reserve
for workmen’s compensation insurance. 1 his
last had in the past been omitted from re-
serves. albeit with doubt. But as the co.
has covered itself in the usual way. it is
now taken in. On March 31. 1924. liabili-
ties were £105,400, to represent which were
liquid and semi-liquid assets amounting to
£103,725. .....

tions satisfactory, and the increased div. (a

Kanowna Red Hill (W.A.), after some
lean months of crushing from outside the
Melba shoot, lias again located that run of
gold at 550 ft. on the underlay. Last two
battery returns aggregated 10790 z. from 781
tons, and brought the stock into the dividend
list again. The co. has pegged more ground
on the strike of the shoot, and the State
Mining-Engineer is to report on the possibili-
ties of the additional area.

The Emu co. claims to have obtained grati-
fying widths and values in boring at Wiluna
(W.A.), but so far the market hasn’t re-
sponded. The concern is controlled by two
or three Adelaide brokers, and, like several
other ventures in similar hands, is anxiously
waiting for Collier’s “big co.” to be formed
and boosted in the hope that it will get a
share of the public’s patronage. Meanwhile
almost every development on the field is de-
scribed as good or promising.

Backed by a favorable report from manager
Vail, of the Lake View and Star, Hampton
Celebration Co. (W.A.) has decided to go
deeper. Just before the last, reconstruc-
tion, which provided £20,000 additional work-
ing capital, chairman Newton Moore declared
that the mine was steadily improving at
depth. It will need to; there cannot be
much, if any, profit in the ore now in sight.
To date the Celebration has been a bitter
disappointment. In 1010 it was purchased
for £50,000 cash and £125,000 in fully-paid
£1 shares. At that time interested persons
with shares to sell whooped about its pros-
pects and reckoned that it would turn out a
lot of gold. The market soared, and the
knowing ones got out. The co.’s capital was
soon spent, and it raised more by debentures.
Later on funds again gave out, and to add to
the co.’s misfortunes the manager was burnt
to death. For some months it has been at
a standstill.

As a sequel to Royal Commissioner
Thomas’s visit and pointed remarks about
out-of-date plants and beliind-tlie-times
methods, one or two of the Kalgoorlie cos.
got George King, on his way back to London,
to make a report. After a hurried inspection
above and below ground. King came to the
conclusion that under the conditions under
which mining is being carried on in Kal-
goorlie to-day it is impossible to do any
better than is being done now. Thomas, of
course, says that these conditions have no
right to exist.

Although State Supreme and Federal High
Courts have decided in favor of the Ravens-
tliorpe copper- and gold-ore suppliers in
their claims against W.A. State Smelters
for overcharges and deductions, the Govern-
ment has not yet paid up. Mines Depart-
ment officials and claimants cannot agree on
account adjustments, and, as the Courts
have awarded interest on claims to date of
settlement, the bill is slowly but surely
approaching the £lOO,OOO mark. Probably
before settlement, the Privy Council will
be asked to say a word. ,

Mutooroo has secured another Westralian
option, this time over the Royal Flush,
Westonia. The Flush is an old show and
owners often have been discouraged by the
fact that its workings almost invariably
bottomed on granite. Recently it was de-
cided to follow the policy of sinking through
the granite successfully adopted by the
owners of Bohemia lease, South Yilgarn.
After sinking for 20 feet, the lode was re-
covered, comparatively undisturbed in point
of average width (4ft.) and value (loz. per
ton) at a depth of 100 feet. Owners are
jubiliant and regard the development as
unusual, though actually Marvel Loch,
Comet, Bohemia and other Yilgarn mines
have had similar features. While the Royal
Flush development is pleasing, granite (or
pegmatite) bars unfortunately replace much
lode material, thereby reducing stoping con-
tent between levels.
* * * *
Since Kalgoorlie became interested in the
bic Great Victoria lode, South Yilgarn
(W.A.), the financial position of Great
Victoria has improved considerably. After
Kalgoorlie management had repaired the old
mill and added suitable supplementary plant,
the co. commenced treatment with a liability
of £lB,OOO. Mining was confined to a surface
deposit of laterite similar to one a few miles
off successfully worked 15 years ago by the
Mountain Queen. In five months the lat-
eritic stuff reduced the £lB,OOO to something
like £13.000. Recently the co. took an option
over French’s lease at Nevoria, aud is
thoroughly testing that show bv carting hun-
dreds of tons to the Great Victoria plant.
Notwithstanding heavy costs, the operation
has been profitable. French’s is quite a
recent find, and very little work has been
done on it. Its lode is similar to the old
Nevoria deposit, and, should present volume
and values persist, the outlook will be pro-
mising. Meantime nothing much is being
done with the Great Victoria lode.

The Public Works Commission’s report on
the Mt. Isa railway has not yet been pub-
lished, but it is pretty well known that it
recommends the short branch line iioin
Duchess. Details will apparently not be
made public until the cos. on the field agree
to certain stipulations as to the development
of ore and the erection of plant. Meantime
shafting and boring is going on at undimin-
ished speed. No. 10 Black Star shaft had
to stop at 260 ft. owing to heavy water, and
probably some difficulty will be found in
getting it down to 300 ft. as proposed. It
was the intention of Mt. Isa Mines to cross-
cut the lode somewhere about that depth.
The shaft as far as it proves anything shows
that values have gone down satisfactorily.
The ore over 4ft. Bin. at the bottom ot No. 10
assayed 20 p.c. lead, 8 p.c. zinc and Boz.
silver, the gross value being a shade over
£0 a ton. As No. 10 is on the dip of the
lode it follows the same vein of ore practi-
cally all the way down, so that complemen-
tary crosscutting is essential. It shows,
however, no mineralogical change to that
depth, and that is promising: for if iron or
arsenic, etc., were to come in it would only be
at the cost of zinc and lead. The Water
Supply Department is sending an officer to
the field to report on water possibilities
underground and surface storage. '

The No. 2 Lander bore at Orallo (Q.)
was abandoned last month at 2840 ft. and
the rigging and plant removed to No. 1.
No. 2 was a complete failure; none of the
gas and oil showings in the first bore were
met with. This has left R. E. Allan, who
is still in charge, the rather unpleasant job
of going back on another man’s leavings
and testing the No. 1, which was abandoned
by D. C. Milsom at 2640 ft. in dire trouble.
The plant has been re-erected there and the
job of fishing for the tools down the bore
is now under way. If Allan can clear the
bore the casing will be tested for leaks first
and then he will cement off the lower water
and test for gas or oil. Non-success will m
no way reflect on Allan’s work with the
co. —he has simply to take Milsom’s opinion
as to the promising oil sand left untested at
the bottom. However, above that sand there
were undoubted showings of gas and oil
which apparently never went as far afield
as No. 2. According to Allan this was due
to faulting, but another common oilfield phe-
nomenon —lenticularity of the beds—could
as well account for it. Unless something of
very great promise is found in No. .1 it is
hardly likely the Orallo area will get another
test. It would be a wise move for the next
area to be where some favorable structure
could be located: the Orallo dome is not
accepted by all owing to the heavy over-
burden of recent formation, which masks the
structure below.

The first shipment of Blair Athol coal for
export (230 tons) was loaded at Rockhamp-
ton for the Malay States. The field is
anxiously waiting to see what sort of recep-
tion it gets. Meantime trade has looked up
slightly and Mt. Morgan has come to light
with an order for 1000 tons during June.
As the co. has its own mine on the Dawson,
this looks like being required for a mix. The
coal from the Dawson Valley mine is semi-
anthracitic, and in composition is very like
the Welsh dry steam coals.
The move to resuscitate the old Mt. Briton
goldfield, behind Mapkay (N.Q.), which was
in former days favorably reported on by
Dr. Jack, has faded out. The effort was
made by a local co., the Nuggety Gully G. M.
Co.; but Mackay was not impressed and
Southern capital was found to be a shy bird,
so that, handicapped by lack of funds, the
co. could not do any serious development.
A little work was done on opening two of
the lodes near the surface, but it was not
sufficient and not very promising. The
failure was due to lack of cash really, and
the field may yet respond to the golden touch
under the impetus of some rich discovery or
when hard cash is more easily garnered.

New Langi Logan (Vic.) recovered
13840 z. from 60 fathoms of wash for the
fortnight, the average holding with the 1240 z.
from 54 fathoms for the previous run. The
wash is described as “average” to “fair”—•
and the 170th call of 3d. on 100,000 shares
became due on May 13.

In-and-out country has been met by the
Golden Stairs at Greensborough (Vic.).
The co. is on right lines. It. got its shaft
down 100 ft. and then punched in 120 ft.
on 18 inches of stone, a trial lot turning the
scale at lloz. to the ton. This was good
enough to encourage the management to
sink another 100 ft. to build up ore reserves.
It will need a long shoot of gold to make
the mine more than a small-party show unless
the reef widens at the new level. On that
may depend the erection of stampers.
Tingha Tin Sluicing (N.S.W.) still lias
difiiculty with its suction cutter, teeth and
all. May yield fell to tons worth £4OO
from 3000 yards, against the April return of
34 tons worth £560 from S5OO yards.

Adelong Gold Estates continues in poorer
ground. ' Weekly yields since January 4
denote the variable nature of the gold con-
tent. Opening with 2700 z. it fell to 184
and 122, hovered around 190 for five weeks
and then ran: 82, 107, 46, S 3, 83, 67, 53,
50, 27, 46 on. Work was held up over Feb-
ruary by the breaking of the crown wheel.

The only splash in oil comes from Tara-
naki's Moturoa bore, a heavy blow-out
having skied the tools and badly damaged
the derrick. Much gas has been blowing,
but it is expected that drilling will be re-
sumed this week. The Tarata bore is down
over 1600 ft. in sandy shale. Mandated De-
velopment's No. 2 bore was down 305 ft. at
latest, still in grey shale. S.A. Oil Wells is
plugging away in brown clay at 630 ft. Lakes
Eunga and Tyers Syndicates (Geo. Meu-
dell’s amalgamated show) talk of harnessing
the natural gas which has been flowing; for
the past year. The gas averages, so it is
said, 1000 B.T.U. compared with 550 to 600
P..T.U. of the Melbourne city supply. But
the talk, like the gas, thus far is in the air.

This is the position of New Guinea Copper,
alias Laloki, at Bootless Inlet. Capital,
£509,095; £394,095 paid in cash, the paper
piaster being a solid £115,000. Then comes
a little wad of bonds (to be met out of in-
come), £39,600. The concern to-day is like
a ship dragging its anchor over a rocky
bottom. Now and again it hangs. Then it
surges a bit nearer the cliffs. Last year
represented another of the bad drifts. Capi-
tal paid in money moved up by over £llO,OOO,
and the overdraft went to £85,770, an in-
crease of £25,000. It was tough going all
the time. Erie Huntley’s hope that wdien
lie obtained the new blower he would rake
in profits didn’t crystallise. Hardly had he
got the blower at work in December than
bang went a portion of the Western No. 2
adit level in the Laloki. The pyrites ignited,
and though he concreted off the fire-zone his
luck was so dead out that behind him a
sudden creep led to a general smasli-up and
more fire. So pretty well the whole mine
had to be sealed. That meant that the
Laloki dumps had to be relied on for smelter
feed, with a little help from the Dubuna.
Thus came about a reversal of the smelter-
converter programme, the change bringing
low-grade matte, restricted work and gen-
eral damnation. However, Huntley got
through with a working loss of £4471, which
interest and other items'swells to £BlO9.
But a lot more was spent besides .that —
£5OOO on the Laloki mine, £27,100 in gen-
eral development, £B5OO in buildings, £6700
in railways, etc., and £22,200 in plant and
machinery. These items tot up to £6S,SOO.
But the co. has on hand as against current
drawings £60.398 of blister copper and matte,
as per valuation, though what it will net when
refined and sold is difficult to say. It is
clear that Huntley has been on the wrestling-
mat the whole time. How his heart must
have rejoiced when he could scrap the old
blower, which stood as a monument of the
unwisdom of giving it house-room! Then
he was iuggled by fire and creep out of the
stock of fresh ore absolutely needed to pro-
vide the right smelter and converter charge.
Yet the furnace was persuaded to treat
23,000 tons of ore which gave 6002 tons
of matte. Low-grade stuff obviously, as the
metal contents were only 1010 tons copper
and 17680 z. gold. Trouble over the mine
and converter ended in the decision to ship
2000 tons of the matte to Kembla and to
follow witli other consignments. That will
bring in cash and enable the converter side
to be nursed into action. Accordingly, eager
listeners-in have received secretary Shackell s
wireless from the Collins House station that
“the results attained during that period [the
last few months], give good ground for the
belief that, failing any hindrance now un-
foreseen, matters should shortly assume a
more favorable complexion.” It can be left
at that.
In commenting on Thabawleik Tin (B.
‘'l /5/’25) it was remarked that presumably
there would be 200.000 shares paid to 20s.
each on which divs. would be wanted when
tiie time came. There are 160,000 shares of
20s. each issued, and L. B. White, Sydney
secretary of Austral Malay, says that no in-
crease is likely. Mr. White insists that Mel-
bourne influence in the co. is negligible.
Actually Thabawleik is one of the Austral
Malay group with no control of any kind m
Melbourne, the only offices being in Sydney
and Taiping, as with all other A.M. cos.

N. S. Wales Mines Department —the only
Department in the State which pays its way
is making available to the public results of
the work of its officers. The “Mineral Re-
sources” series, started many years ago., is
being continued, and the bulletins, which
started last year, now number 16, although
No. 0. on “The Coal Resources of N.5.W.,”
lias only just been issued. The original work
was by E. F. Pittman, and this latest edition
has been thoroughly revised. Coal is graded
according to ash content. Known reserves
of A-grade (5-12 p.c. ash) are estimated at
<>,800,<100,000 tons; B-grade (12-20 p.c. ash)
5,100,000,000 tons; and C-grade (exceeding
20 p.c. ash) 8,150,000,000 tons —20 thousand
million tons in all. As 14,000 souare miles
of coal areas are still undeveloped and they
are conservatively estimated to contain five
times as much as the known areas (1200
square miles), it is plain that N.S.W. is in
no immediate danger of a fuel shortage. The
more economical working and more scientific
treatment of the coal for oil and other by-
products is now a problem calling for solu-
tion.


The Evolution of Banking
It is difficult to trace the actual beginning of banking, but the
interchange of goods between the people even from prehistoric
times has gradually led up to the present highly efficient systems of
banking in vogue throughout the world. The generally accepted
derivation of the word Bank is from the Italian word banco—a
bench, from the fact that the Jews of Lombardy used benches in
the market places for the exchange of money and bills. However
interesting the history of the evolution of banking may be one
conclusion is undoubted—the present-day system is most highly
efficient and comprehensive—yet even in these days of intense
organisation it is rarely indeed that you will find a bank which so
efficiently and comprehensively combines every phase of banking,
general or savings, as your own national bank, the
Commonwealth lank of Hustralia.

When this issue went to press two re-
spected citizens had failed to get back—
(l. Fuller, of N.S.W., and 11. Amundsen, late
of Spitzbergen. Both were out in the cold.
Despite bears and whales, the Polar man is
expected back first.
“S. Gumm”: That Bulletin reference
to G. M. Burns’s defeat of George
Fuller for the Illawarra seat in the
House of Reps. recalls that seven
other politicians achieved the Premier-
ship of their States after being turned down
by Commonwealth electorates. The list com-
prises Watt, of Victoria; the late Tom Ryan
and Gillies, of Queensland; the late Tom
Price, Crawford Vaughan and John Gunn,
of South Aus.; and Joe Lyons, of the Speck.
Lyons stood for Darwin in 1919, Gunn for
Roothby in 1917, and Gillies for Richmond
(N.S.W.) in 1910—there were four candi-
dates, and he finished fourth. The moral
seems to be that he who aspires to become
State Premier should first contrive to get
licked for a Federal seat.
Veteran Byron Moore, the retiring sec.
of the V.R.C., is one of Australia’s long-
distance pensioners; since 1878 he has drawn
£2BO p.a. from the Vic. Government-—the
price he got for being pushed out of his
job as Assistant-Surveyor-General in the
most notable economy drive in the State’s
history. At least, economy was the excuse;
actually the wholesale sacking was a hit by
the Government at an obdurate Upper
House, whose mem-
bers were supposed
to have influenced
the appointment of
the people care-
fully selected for
the axe; and sub-
sequently the
“economy” idea
was dropped alto-
gether. In Byron
Moore’s case
“Black Wednes-
day” cost the
people £13,000.

Sympathy with womanhood suffrage was a
strong link between* Br: J. B. Nash, M.L.C.,
and Rose Scott; and now, a few months
after the lady's death, the kindly old sur-
geon follows her. Although no Laborite, he
gave so much free medical assistance to the
political members of the Labor party when
they were mainly poor men struggling to
live on a Parliamentary salary of £3OO per
annum that they jestingly called him
“Honorary Physician to the Labor party.”
Nash was born at sea in 1857, when his
father, also a doctor, was bringing his family
to Australia. He enlisted at the outbreak
of the war, serving for two years with the
Medical Service, and he was 69 years old
when he died.
The retired Anglican Rev. S. Hungerford
is in his 100th year. He was the first vicar
of the Anglican cathedral at Armidale
(N.S.W.) when the parish covered an exten-
sive tract of country, and he sent his greet-
ing the other day to the Armidale synod.
After waiting at the bedside for seven years
Death claimed Corporal Stanley H. Ncilson,
Caulfield Hospital’s oldest inhabitant, last
week. Neilson, a prominent and promising
Victorian athlete when he enlisted, had lived
through so much of the war that a sanguine
hope of going through unscathed seemed jus-
tifi e d, when a
wound in the spine
m a d e him a
casualty, Recovery
being regarded as
impossible, he was
hurried back to
Australia, but the
death that was ex-
pected delayed its
coining. From the
day he was
wounded the unfor-
tunate war-wreck
lias lain on his bed,
unable to rise, but
bearing his afflic-
tion with fortitude.

Maoriland,
“De la Poor”: Up our way (Mitchell, Q.)
we think this is a record for people who
were not out to make one. .T. S. Kirby, of
Inverleigh West, in the Gulf country, accom-
panied by his friend Goldman, of Brisbane,
driving a super-six Hudson car, left Tan-
goran, on the Muttaburra-road, 72 miles
from Ilughenden, at 6.50 on Thursday,
May 21, and arrived at Mitchell at 6.20 the
following day, covering a distance of 504
miles in under 24 hours. They experienced
several delays, once taking a wrong turning
and travelling some distance before discover-
ing their mistake. Locked railway gates in
two instances caused more delay. These
and other waits reduced the actual travelling
time to 194 hours.
When ex-Australian journalist Harry Hol-
land, leader of the M.L. Labor party, beat
J. G. Coates, the new Dominion Premier,
some years ago. he got a message which
puzzled him: “Congratulations. You never
need shiver again.” Later he asked liia
congratulator what it all meant. “Didn’t
you get 300 overcoats?” came the reply.
“Lily-Boale”: Most great generals have
some little peculiarity or other which is
fixed-on by the men serving under them as a
sign that things may be expected to happen
in the immediate future. Lord Ypres had
a way of opening and shutting his mouth
many times on the eve of a battle. Tommies
used to say: “There’s old French fly-catching
again !” and when the fly-catching was much
in evidence it was a sure sign of warm work
in the offing.
“The Deacon”: Bathurst’s (N.S.W.)
noblest son (or thereabouts) went out the
other day. He may be best remembered for
h.is work in Asia as a Trade Commissioner
by the grace of the Holman Government, but
we Bathurst folk who remember his old
English father, a member of the House of
Doddery, will best remember his prowess as
a rifleshot, and his habit of wearing a rabbit
wing or a ouail’s tail in In's hat. Under the
family station’s name of Wyangden he dis-
guised his success as a pigeon-slayer. Bligli
Suttor, whose appointment as M.L.C. by the
Storey Government did so much to unseat
Dooley, is a son.
Slipped off noiselessly last month. E. H.
Dawson, surveyor, of Broken Hill. He was
at Balranald in 1884 measuring scenery for
the Lands Department, and made his way
from there to Broken Hill, then mostly
rnulga and wallabies. William Jamieson
had received instructions to survey the line
of lode : but he was interested in the B. H.
Prop, claims, so Dawson did the original
survey. T. H. Nutt, who pegged the Central
lease—now the Sulphide Corporation’s—-was
short of cash, and offered Dawson a half-
share in the claim if he would pay the money
(£8 55.) to take up the lease; but he was
prevented by departmental regulations from
becoming interested in any of the claims be
was surveying. To get a bite from Dawson
it was only necessary to mention Rasp as
the discoverer of the field. His version was
that tw T o men, one of whom was Frank Ilaw-
son, had come from Melbourne to report on
the hill with the peculiar outcrop before
Rasp had anything to do with it.
Andy Lysaght, the N.S.W. South Coast
solicitor who lately had himself changed into
a barrister, has got even with Premier Fuller
after 24 years. In 1901 Lysaght opposed
Fuller for the Illawarra Federal seat (Alick
Hay, sometime M.H.R. for New England,
was the other candidate), and lost his tie*
posit. Now Lysaght enters the State Assem-
bly as one of the Labor members for Wollon-
dilly, Fuller’s electorate, having deprived the
Government of what it reckoned a safe seat.
And his success may cost his old antagonist
the Premiership.
Dead in Adelaide, at 69, David Mack, care-
taker of the Government offices, where his
garden quadrangle, with lawn and fountain,
is one of the sights of the city. He was an
authority on dogs, and judged for many
years at shows and at the local Waterloo
Cup: he selected for Oscar Asche to take
to England the afterwards highly successful
Ena’s Delight, which Asche rcchristened
Once Australia on the other side. With
John Creswell he helped to found the much-
criticised enclosed coursing-ground at sub-
urban Plympton. Latterly he was an inter-
state bowls expert. Elford Mack, the
’cellist, is a son, and Louise Mack a cousin.
Philanthropist Aaron Danks, one of Mel-
bourne’s merchant princes, has got the
knighthood for which the Vic. Government
recommended him three years ago. Mel-
bourne Hospital committee. Hall Research
Institute and (he Child’s Welfare Associa-
tion have had him as president for a long
time, and he has many other humanitarian
activities. In his spare hours he lias kept
an eye on the big hardware show r of which
he is the king-pin. If he cares for the handle
he is more entitled to it than most others
who have secured it in recent years.
The limelight falls oftener on Councillor
Rogers, of Richmond (Melb.), than
upon most municipal dignitaries: the ener-
getic Labor woman is prominent in all sorts
of causes, from the well-being of women and
children to unemployment relief; and to
her record even political opponents lift their
hats. Mrs. Rogers was left a widow with a
quiverful of children. Pier own experience
gave her a large sympathy for others in a
similar condition, and moved her to organise
the Office Cleaners’ Union, and, later, the
Miscellaneous Workers’ Union. A poor
speaker, but a painstaking worker, she is now
paid organiser of the Women’s Branch of
the Victorian A.L.P.
Dr. PI. V. Evatt, the young Labor candi-
date who put up the astonishing perform-
ance in Balmain —he gained 14,850 primaries
and had 7000 to give away—carried into lrs
first campaign, the thoroughness which
(•allied, of course, to other things) won him
the highest honors Sydney Uni. ever gave
with M.A. and LL.l>. degrees. As soon as
lie became a selected candidate lie began to
compile an index to the constituency, with
a brief history of every elector and everyone
capable of being turned into an elector; and
to every available man and woman on the
list he personally submitted himself for a
sort of cross-examination. And that was
independent of the 200-odd addresses he
made in his three months’ canvass. Evatt,
who is a native of Maitland (N.S.W.), got
his introduction to the courts as associate
to the late Chief Justice.
That most punctilious of Vic. Public Ser-
vice -officers, J. G. McKie, sec. of the Marine
Board, has retired on account of failing
health. Pie joined when he was a youth of
17, 52 years ago. He was the Fitzgibbon of the
Marine Board, Marine Court and Pilots’
Superannuation Board, and he was probably
the inventor of the phrase, “A place for
everything, and everything in its place.” Pie
has an aloof and official manner; neverthe-
less his trainees usually did well in other
departments when promoted or transferred,
and if they did not love him they respected
him for the valuable gruelling he gave them.
The Supreme Court of S.A. has had to de-
cide a dispute among the trustees of John
Darling, wheat merchant and politician,
brother of the cricketer and one of the only
three or four men in the State who have
ever left a million. His confidential manager,
W. J. Hill, continued as a trustee, but lias
now fallen out with the Darling sons. Ilis
.claim for trustee’s commission was met with
,a series of objections to his conduct. The
Court found for him ; he had earned £31,000,
’.has already had £lB,OOO. and should receive
the rest. But Judge Parsons ordered the
prompt refunding of £l4B, rebates made by
insurance cos. on premiums paid for the
Broken Hill Prop. John Darling, chairman of
that co.. used to take such moneys to Mel-
bourne with him, presumably to hand over
at directors’ meetings: and (said the Court)
the later rebates should also have gone to the
Prop. It would be interesting to get from
the trustee a true and particular explana-
tion of why they didn’t go straight away,

W. IT. Denyer has retired at 72—the fate-
ful day has been postponed twice in consider-
ation of his obvious fitness —-from the post
of Chief Clerk of the Adelaide Local Court,
which he has seen rise from a mere shhill-
debts court to a busy tribunal that relieves
tlie Supreme Court of any matters under
£5OO. Henry Downer was his first iriagis;
trate, and the Bench has since been occupied
by Stuart, Russell, and now Mitchell and
Paine jointly. Denyer wait it Sailor before
settling in Australia, and WaS in the wfeck
of the Yatala, under Captain. LegUe, in the
English Channel in 1878, with Australian
passengers and 'cargo.
One Australian Digger has found the road
to his real vocation through his injuries.
Enlisting in Brisbane early in 1915. he went
through Gallipoli with the 25th Battalion.
Later, while on the French front, lie was
so grievously wounded that lie lost all power
in both bis arms; undergoing over 20 opera-
tions before lie regained the use of them.
He used to sing a bit; and the sister-in-
charge was so taken with the quality of
bis voice that she taught him two songs,
which he sang at a IlarefDld Hospital con-
cert. As a result, he was introduced to Bit
Henry Wood, who personally instructed lliiU,
and when his physical recovery was complete
sent him to the Royal Academy for tuition.
Later the young tenor studied Under tljC

Ewing Blytli, just dead at Connewarre
(Vic.), had a narrow escape from arriving
in Australia as a corpse. That was 72 years
ago, when, a youth of 22, he lit out for
Australia in the Earl of Charlemont, which
piled itself up on Barwon Heads. His desti-
nation was Sydney, originally, but after
wringing himself dry he decided that Provi-
dence had taken a hand, so stayed where lie
was put. As a result the Barwon district
has profited by 48 of his grandchildren, and
there are 20 more descendants in the un-
finished newer generation.
“Uramao” : Point Halswell, the lonely spot
where Priminister Massey is buried, is named
after Edmund Storr Halswell, who arrived
in Wellington in 1840, became Sub-Protector
of Aborigines, and later was a Judge of tin
Supreme Court. Mr. Massey is buried in an
old gunpit, built by a brother of that Francis
Bell who succeeded him as Priminister. The pit
was constructed for the purpose of mounting
a gun to repel the Russian invasion that was
expected in 1886. It is just as well the Rus-
sians did not make their call, for when the
first shot was fired in 1891 it nearly brought
elm city down about the ears of its inhabi-
tants.
THE EXILE OF ERIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Two hundred military police were unable to prevent
trouble when General Owen O’Duffy, Chief Com-
missioner of the Irish Free State Civic Guards in
Dublin, arrived to review the 165th Infantry Regiment.
Twenty women were ejected from the armory after
eggs had been hurled at the Irish General. General
O'Duffy stood his ground, and met the barrage of
eggs by smiling up at the balcony whence the
missiles came. Following the proceedings a ‘free-
for-all’ fight occurred.” —New York item in the
A no us.
Did ye hear the great news of it, Terence, me lad?
There was throuble, they say, and the colleens so
mad,
Shure, they talked to the Gin’ral, that broth of
a bhoy,
With an aim that was good and with eggs that was
bad.
Och, Owen O’Duffy
Was threated so rough, he
Might well have been back in ould Dublin, bedad.
Is there ever a wince from the Gineral bold ?
Does he do a shtampede as he hollers out “Hold!”
Not a wince nor a holler nor yet a shtampede—
’Tis the bravest of brave as the papers have told.
Och, Owen O’Duffy
Was made of right stuff; he
Would have a good nerve and a heart, then, of gold.
For he shtands and he shmiles at those women so
wild,
And wild women take facing, then, Terence, in 3
child ;
’Tis a wild bull o’ Bashan I’d rather be near;
But he shmiles and he shtands, not a bit of him
riled.
Och, Owen O’Duffy
Was powerful tough ; he
Just thries to put on them the cometner mild.
But the trate of it, bhoy, was the fine free-for-all
That they joined in so hearty, the great and the
small;
’Tis good Irish they have in New York as in Cork ;
’Tvvas a meeting the like o’ the best Donegal.
To Owen O’Duffy
They can’t do enough ; he
Would not have a need to be home-sick at all.

ABORIGINAHTIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
‘C. Coral ’: Like all primitive people, the
Tones Strait islanders set great store by the stars
;;n;l regulate a good deal of their work by them.
A star very popular just now is Kek, which ticks
oil' the date for the eating of the new season’s yams.
An interesting custom associated with his appearance
was formerly carried out in the islands. When Kek
was about due, careful watch was kept, and on the
hist signs of his appearance the zogo-man notified the
people, who came at night to the beach, where canoes
"eie drawn up. Two young girls were put into
canoes; then some of’ the got in, and also
men with bundles of dried cocoanut leaf, which they
lighted and beat the sides of the canoe with.
The women, as Kek appeared, stood up holding in
their hands pointed pieces of wood about 2ft. long,
and petitioned for “good luck’’ in their turtle catch-
ing and their cultivation of crops. The idea of the
ov.ng girls being placed in the stern was to suggest
that the turtle might be young and tender “all same
girl. ’ The sticks were kept for digging the first
fruit from the gardens, and for locating fish on the
reefs. According to my informant, “When woman he
put that stick underneath stone, he feel that fish
hiding, and he can tell what kind of fish by feel;
no matter if he can’t see that fish, he know what
kind—rock-cod or any kind.” It was. a sort of divin-
ing rod, in fact, and seems to have been very popular.
’Lnto ’: About .‘>o years ago eitronella
was known to attract fruit-fly, so the old German
of “Snowy’s” par (B. 7./5/’25) was very tardy in
his discovery. The Queensland Government now owns
the rights ol “The Harvey hire.” The ingredients are
secret, but it is believed to contain the same liquid.
This lure is now in the stage of being standardised
and distributed to orchardists at about cost price
Much benefit is expected from its use, and the results
so tar obtained are encouraging; orchards in which
it has been applied have been immune or practically
so, whilst neighboring ones were heavily attacked,
the benefit of the Harvey formula over the pure oil
is that it acts under all conditions.
“D. 8.”: Some years ago when a mouse
plague was at its worst in Riverina, Arthur Chant,
near Ooolamon, one dark night, laid a trail of wheai
about 10 yards long outside his bam and focussed
the light from a bike-lamp on it. He then knelt,
gun in hand, in the darkness behind, and, when
the rodents were properly set to the feast, drew a
bead, and pulled. The resulting bag was 230 mice.
This was the effect, not 'of a shot fired from a swivel
gun, or from a long-tom half filled with minute mis-
siles, but of a No. 12 cartridge, charged with quail-
shot, and fired through an ordinary shotgun. How
is it for a record?
Pat Bushie”: I have never been with
record-breakers in the double-barrel shoots at flocks
of ducks (B. 7/5/’?5), but I recollect a decent bag
I assisted in collecting when no one had a thought
of duck-shooting. The dewy galvanised-iron roof
of our house out in the Darling country, glistened
and _ shimmered like a limpid 'pool under the
brilliant light of a mid-summer full mocn. A
flock of quaekers, passing high overhead, nose-dived
mt-i the seemingly inviting pool. For a moment we
thought the house was being bombarded; rushing
outside, we saw the remnants of the army slew off
to safety. But we picked up 39 dead or maimed.

“Moe”: Not far from the Santa Cruz
group in the Pacific is a small island which is
probably the most fly-
ridclen spot in the
world. The pests are
so thick there that
they form clouds, and
when one of them
settles the object is
covered to the depth
of several inches. A
human being landing
on the island quickly
has his eyes, mouth,
nose and ears filled
with the insects. They
also get into his
clothes, so that his
pockets are soon full
of them. On the rare
occasions on which a
schooner calls at this
island swarms of the
flies follow it for some
distance sometimes
until it has got be-
yond sight of land.
There is little vege-
, ■ , , , tation on this speck of
an island, and no water. What the insects live on
is a mystery.
<<T f . * * *
hat is the cause of crimp
in the fibres of wool ? Is it structural or artificial y
Personally 1 am of opinion that it is the latter, and
can be considerably accentuated. While on the
sheep a fleece is a fairly compact layer of fibres
ie d together by yolk and “binders,” the compactness
increasing toward the tip owing to the accumulation
of dust, etc. The fleece, as a whole, must exert
pressure on the individual fibres which comprise
u, and as these fibres keep pushing upwards, there
is resistance at both ends. A yielding substance
pressed evenly at both ends tends to wave; this
structure is often seen in layers of rock, and is held
by geologists to' be produced by the earth’s pressure.
Crimp is much less in a loose fleece than in
one dense and compact, and there is not so much
crimp in bellywool as on the back and sides, indicat-
ing that the denser the fleece the more uniform is
the crimp. Generally speaking, fine fibres show more
cumps to the inch than coarser types, as the
former respond more easily to the pressure. “Kemp”
fib,es are only slightly crimped, as their strength
enables them largely to overcome the pressure exerted
by the fleece. A fairly tight and weighty covering,
such as that sometimes put round show sheep, will
increase the pressure on the ends of the growing
fibres and tend to make them “crimpier.” If a
din. patch on the back or side of a sheep is shorn
every three months, the short staple will show
little crimping compared with the rest of the fleece,
which is subjected to the ordinary pressure of the
full-length wool. If crimping is a structural feature,
as often claimed, it should be the same in both of
the foregoing cases, also in loose wool as in dense,
and with coarse fibres as well as fine.
NOBLESSE OBLIGE.
PATRONISING FLATTITE (who has just given, charlady a cup of tea): “And how do you
find your tea, Mrs. Maleohy?”
MRS. MULCOHY: "Just as I like it, ma’am—cowld and wake.”
“Troophorse”: Some weeks ago “Booth
B.” strongly questioned my par. on skin and dress
diving (B. 19/2/’25). In fact, he said, speaking as
an old diver, that anything over 25 fathoms could
not be done. Well, in support of my previous par.
let me give further evidence of deep-water “dress”
feats. The Oligushi gear was employed during 191 -
-19 in breaking up the Norwegian vessel Calendar
sunk at 200 feet off Nagasaki Harbor. During July,
1919, in a test before Japanese naval officers, depths of
282, 284 and 324 feet respectively were reached off
Kanoh-zaki, and later on the test divers succeeded
in collecting corals at the great depth of 375 feet.
Seveial years ago the Japanese offered this patent
to the Thursday Island Pearlers’ Association. A
thorough test was given at Darnley in waters ranging
to 40 fathoms. After coming to the surface from
40 fathoms the test-diver was examined by a doctor,
who pronounced him perfectly normal. With this
equipment the diver can prepare himself for work-
in three minutes, and can also work into or out of
narrow places with ease.
* * * *
“Wandi”: The largest known motli (B.
14/5/’25) is the giant species of North Queensland
(Coscinocora Hercules ), captured specimens of which
have measured over I7in. across the wings. It is
found in the coastal scrubs between Cairns and Cape
York. Youths in that region imprison a female in
a gauze cage, which is placed in a scrub at night,
and then catch the males attracted to the prisoner
from a distance round. The magnet is probably
a scent imperceptible to humans. Other moths have
the same curious power of attraction.
“Tui Mataka”: “Billy See” (B. 12/3/’25)
says that he would like to know if eastern-side camel
carriers have ever done better than the Coolgardie
record of 9141 b. for the one beast. My nomination
is Abdul Wade’s black bull-camel on the O.K. to
Mungana road in the boom days. His little load
was invariably the exact half-ton, exclusive of
saddle-weight.
* * * #
“Herodot”: “F.A.’s” reference to Austra-
lians in England (B. 21/5/’25) reminds me of an
occasion in ’lrisco (U.S.A.) some years ago when I
unexpectedly met a fellow-countryman. One Sunday
afternoon, having nothing better to do, I went for a
stroll along a street near the Presidio. My attention
was attracted by some tall gums in the garden of a
house which I was passing, and while standing look-
ing at them I was surprised to see a sharp red nose
poked over the top of the fence, and a pair of keen
eyes gazing at me. There was something familiar
about the nose, and on investigation I found that
it belonged to a full-grown kangaroo, which appa-
rently lived in the garden. As 1 was stroking its
head the ’roo’s owner came out and spoke to me.
He was a colonel in the Coast Artillery quartered
near by, and when I referred to the animal as a
kangaroo he corrected me politely, and said it was
a bandicoot. Further questioning elicited that he
had some years before bought a ’roo and a 'coot
from a sailor on one of the mailboats running to
Australia. The ‘coot had died shortly afterwards,
anti he had been under the impression that it was
the ’roo he had lost. He told me that, although the
kangaroo had been little more than a “joey” when
he had taken it over, he had not had the slightest
difficulty in rearing it.
“Morob”: “Troophorse’s” description of
the way Northern Territory abos. avoid crocodiles
when crossing a croc.-infested creek (B. 21/5/’25)
might have included a reference to the method adopted
by the dogs in those parts. When the N.T. dog
wants to cross a stream, he first stands on the bank
and barks loudly for a few minutes, to attract to
the spot any crocs, which may be in the vicinity.
Then he hurriedly runs a couple of hundred yards
along the bank and crosses at another spot in safety
Sometimes, however, the scheme fails, as when, for
example, he happens to meet a croc, which has
just reached the real crossing-place on its way to
the spot at which Carlo barked. But it'is not often
this happens, for it takes a clever croc, to catch
a dog which has become used to dodging the reptiles
On the other hand, dogs from districts in which
there are no crocs, generally fall easy victims.

“Zululander” : Re length of Papuan bows,
our friend' “Parama” is misinformed wheh he states
that the longest bow that can be found—and he says
he took some trouble to get a long one—is 75 inches.
I have in my possession a bow that is 85-fin. long.
It came from inland of Mekeo, up Yule Island
direction. The average bow, as he states rightly,
is about 6ft. in length.
* * * *
„ “Spenner” on weight-lifting (B.
‘-l/o/ 25) tells a good tale of fortitude; but I
know a better. On the Pikedale (Q.) soldiers’ settle-
ment, in the early days, one Edwards, single-handed,
sank a well 25 feet, filling the buckets on the bottom,
climbing to the surface, winding them up, and then
climbing down again and filling more. At 25 feet
lu struck water, and could then draw £1 a foot
from the Government advance, so he was thereafter
able to pay a mate to help him.
“S.C.": One curious habit attributed to
the lung fish (Ceratodus josteri) of N.Q. river's is
that it often crawls out of water and lies sunning
itself on a partially-submerged log. This ancient
species of fish also makes nocturnal visits to the
shore, vvhere it browses on tender grass and leaves.
It is said to attain a length of six feet. Fossil teeth
of the ceratodus had been found in certain forma-
tions in Europe, India and America long before the
living fish which corresponded to the fossil form was
discovered in the Queensland streams. Locally, the
lung fish is often called barramundi, being confused
with an allied form which is rightly entitled to the
abo. name. It is also called “Burnett River salmon,”
by reason of its pinkish flesh, which is considered
fair table meat.

A RURAL ROMANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She didn t know the knack of gowns; she just dressed
anyhow,
Did Dorrie whose chief job in life was but to Milk
the Cow.
But, all the same, those careless clothes. I solemnly
declare,
Seemed just the very kind of clothes that Beautv
ought to wear.
They were not up-to-date a bit,
But what, 1 ask you. mattered it ?
So young she was and fair!
A casual handy-man was 1, who carpentered a bit
And splashed the paint upon the walls w'here there
was call for it.
Ana sometimes, by the way, those walls gave out no
urgent cry
For any coat of paint at all; but who could well deny
Their surfaces a color scheme?—
Not I by any means, 1 deem—
When She was lingering by !
She rose at daylight every morn—in winter much
before—
And made for me a cup of tea, then vanished through
the door, „
Her buckets jangling cheerily—they played a merrj
tune,
To which no ear however thick could wholly be
immune—•
No matter were it summer time,
With mornings destitute of rime,
Or in the month of June.
She wasn’t quite grammatical—she mixed her ayes
and ain’ts,
And oft her double negatives got tangled with the
paints!
She couldn’t quote much poetry except a little thing
That once I wrote and posted for the cash that iT
would bring.
She’d blush and say; “That’s bonzer, boy!”
Appreciation sans alloy
She spoke... .and I was king !
Her dad was a prosaic man, and yet, all else above,
The fact was he was married, and so must have been
in love—
Must have seen his bronzed face mirrored in a pair
of luring eyes—
Must have hotly kissed their owner, to their owner’s
feigned surprise—
Aye, must have really told*her this
(A kiss) and that (another kiss!)
And murmured fond good-byes. "
“DO YOU HEAR THIS, HENRY? WE'RE GOING BACK
TO GOLD AGAIN.”
And so he looked approvingly, or didn’t look at all.
When Dorrie stood beside me while I splashed each
thirsty wall.
And her mother used to wink a wink that seemed
to cutely say:
“There’s a wedding-time a-eoming—and it isn't far
away !”
And Dorrie’s blushes widely spread ;
1 still in fancy see that red,
And shall for many a day.
But casual jobs don’t last for e’er, and hammer,
brace and saw
Must operate, then be dismissed by Time’s relentless
law.
The city-call came once again but often when the
night
Lowers its shroud upon the streets 1 feel inclined
to write.
But ah, alas, ’tis plain to me
I quite dropped out of memory
When 1 dropped out of sight!

"Mason”: “Troopliorse” on the “boy” who
<nt overboard at sight of the skulls (B. 14/5/’251
) rings back a yarn told by big Jack Evans, who
ran a Thursday Island pub until his death a year
or so ago. It happened in the days when the hand-
ling of the pearling-luggers was not, as now, left
entirely to Japs and natives. Evans went with the
fleet then, and, when a boy from another boat
brought news of the death of one of its crew, he
crossed over to investigate. He found the corpse
bearing no apparent sign of foul play. The man,
they told him, had been “elose-up die” for a day
or so and quite dead for four or five hours. Not
having a text-book on the signs of death with him,
and spying some water boiling close at hand, to
make assurance doubly sure he emptied the scalding
stuff on the bare belly of the deceased. The corpse
sat up with a grunt. Evans himself was taken aback,
but the resurrection was altogether too much for the
boys standing around. The succeeding silence was
punctuated by splash after splash as, boy by boy,
they hit the water and went for their lives. The
“corpse” was still alive but moribund from beri-
beri when they landed him at the T. I. Hospital.

“Slam”: Insects are by no means all pests.
Most of our ground beetles are carnivorous, preying
upon minute forms of insect lift, and they are also
great scavengers, consuming dead matter, and so
preventing disease and the spread of flies which breed
in offal. The “ladybird” is one of the greatest
checks on the introduced plant lice, scale-insects
and aphides. Other useful insect-hunters are the
dragon-flies and praying-mantis, while the quaint
ant-lion does his daily bit by trapping and devour-
ing every ant which comes his way. Our native
ichneumon-fly lays its eggs in the soft bodies of
many leaf-eating grubs and caterpillars, and nearly
all the native wasps and bees are either beneficial
or harmless. The worst insect pests in Australia—
the bot-fly, sheep-nostril fly, fruit-fly, sheep-tick,
grain-weevil and several kinds of mosquitoes and
cockroaches —-are immigrants.
“Bilbav”: Although I've never seen Binghi
with a snowy thatch, I’ve seen hundreds of Mela-
nesians with hair of all shades of color from common or
garden ginger to pure white. They bleach it with
lime made from burnt coral. In some parts of the
JUST A LITTLE FRIENDLY ARGUMENT.
“An' I tell you this, Mrs. Spriggins-my Eileen's music cost us
more money than your old man ever earnt in his life.”
“Oh, did it? Yer neighbors sued ye for damages, I s'pose.”
Pacific a boy is not considered a man-about-town
unless his hair is bleached, and it is not uncommon
to see young men with lime-plaster smeared all
over their heads. In Graciosa Bay (Big Santa Cruz)
I saw a coon the starboard side of whose head
was white and the port jet-black. A very bionic
ship’s engineer cnce told me that his engine-boy
informed him he put lime on his head because “Me
wantem grass belong head belong me all same grass
belong you. Two-feller, one kind.” When I first
went to those parts the local lads threw plainly
envious glances at my nut. Ever since I can
remember I've been “Snowy.”
“G.E.C.”: In aboriginal rock carvings
and drawings there is significance underlying the
apparently haphazard designs, and to the native
the shortest line or smallest circle conveys a mean-
ing. Apparent crudities of art and disregard of the
laws of drawing serve to identify the bird or animal
which it is intended to represent. Thus both a
samel and a horse are four-legged, but if a native
drew a camel he would affix a cloven hoof to one
leg, so that his picture would not be mistaken for
that of a horse. Conventional signs, also, were, and
still are, used by the aboriginal artist to convey
his meaning. A lizard is represented by a long
straight line crossed at right angles by two shorter
lines; a turtle is shown by a circle, with six short
lines (the head, tail and flippers) radiating from
the circumference. A frog is also a circle, but with
only four lines. The symbolical representation of
a fight was a pair of crossed boomerangs which be-
came a simple cross; and a wavy line is a snake or
snake track. This conventionalism reaches its high-
est point in the “message sticks.’ ’ On these men
are represented by straight upright lines, with shorter
lines for women. Any number of people can be
represented by the same number of lines. If a
zig-zag line follows the row of strokes, it shows
that the people are cn the march; if a small dot
is placed beside each line, it shows that the people
are camped, the dots representing campfires.
* * * *
“Snowy”: My grand-dad used to suffer
severely from rheumatism in his legs. Following the
advice of an old bushman he spilt broad young aloe
leaves in two and bound the flat sappy pieces on his
legs like splints, keeping them there for some hours
The sap acted as a liniment and on every occasion
gave speedy relief.
* * * *
“Moe”; One of New Guinea’s most venom-
ous creatures is the giant scorpion found on the coast
in the vicinity of Eitape and the neighboring Dutch
territory. Frequently it reaches a length of from
8 to 10 inches, the stinging-apparatus on its tail
being an ugly, hook-shaped protuberance, capable of
making a small gash in the victim’s flesh, instead of
the puncture made by the ordinary variety. The
agony caused by a sting from one of these creatures
is almost as great as that produced by the stone-fish,
while the effects of the poison injected are sufficient
to incapacitate a full-grown man for some days, and
in a child even to cause death. The size of the
scorpion, however, acts as a safeguard against its
attack, for it is more easily seen than the ordinary
kind, which may lurk almost anywhere unobserved.
* * * *
“Hydras”: It may be information to
“Jimmy Possum” that tartrate of antimony will
kill all the ants that annoy him. Let him add a
saltspoonful to a tablespoonful of honey and leave
the mixture where the ants are found. They will
soon discover it, but next day will be missing,
except for a few carrying the casualties home for
winter storage.
* * * *
“Troophorse”: Among the natives who
roam the Sir Edward Pellew Islands are some
queer characters. The
most remarkable is a
tall, thin native, Bush-
ranger Jack, who, by
the way, claims North
Island as his exclusive
territory and gets
quite annoyed if others
of the tribe visit there
to rob him of turtle
eggs and other native
foods. Jack has a tall,
thin gin, Alice by
name, with two child-
ren, boy and girl. They
live on the islands
and seldom, if ever,
visit the mainland.
Jack when he mated
with Alice evidently
broke some tribal mar-
riage custom, as he is
now regarded by the
rest of the natives as
an outcast. In fact,
he can look only one
or two natives in the
face, or talk at close
quarters with them.
When he meets another
native he shields his
face with his hand
and talks at a distance,
looking the other way.
One time during a
shortage of labor we
had to call upon him
for service as a lugger-
hand, and his antics
on board had us in fits
of laughter. On heav-
ing up. Jack with
several others manned
the windlass, but could
only use one hand,
the other being employed in shielding his face.
Alice is not thus penalised, and mixes with all and
everyone, as do the two children.
* * *
‘‘L. I. Orevildoc” : Has any member of the
Abo. Council noticed the traits in the character
of bushmen with greyish-colored eyes ? For 11
years in a bush general store I have been doing
so, and note that the grey-eyed rabbit-trapper usually
presents the biggest cheques for payment. Whether
it is luck, skill or diligence I have not decided.
On the other hand, the brown-eyed son of toil is
better at fencing and ploughing.
“Linklater”: Throughout the cy&lone sea-
son a couple of railway carpenters kept a watchful
eye on a large ti-tree sheltering their galvanised-irou
hut at Banyan (N.Q.). Boisterous winds failed to
shake it, but recent heavy rains loosened the roots,
and the catastrophe came on a perfectly still night
when both men slept. The crash killed John Crabbie
and seriously injured his mate, J. 11 mie.
* * * *
“Marovo”: My Solomon Island cook boy is
responsible for this yearn. Long ago, when the
world was young, Dartau (the sun) was stationary
in the sky, and the
continued heat de-
stroyed the yams, taro,
pana, etc., till all the
women and children
were starving. So a
council was called, and
it was decided to give
him a hiding. The
first thing done was to
send for Onamai, the
crack bow-and-arrow
shot, and all hands
started making arrows.
Then Onamai got busy.
The first arrow pierced
the sun and stuck
there, the second went
into the haft of the
first, and so on till
the line reached the
ground. All the men
then climbed up to the
sun and prepared to
thrash him, but were
met by Dartau’s mother,
who asked what the
trouble was. On being
told she said that on
condition they didn’t
hurt him she would
promise the sun would
“walk about.” To
this they agreed, and
the sun duly set out on
his “walkabout,” leav-
ing the arrows lying
all over the sky. His
young wife then ap-
peared and started to
lament her desertion,
but on being told the
reason followed in pur-
suit of him. Her luck,
however, was out, as
she trod on an arrow
and now is crippled,
which explains why
Oola (the moon) is continually chasing her husband,
but gets a little further behind every day.
“Geordie”: Some 100 miles north of Port
Augusta (S.A.), between Lake Torrens and Lake
Frome, there is a deposit of red ochre in the Flinders
Range which for ages past has been visited by
the aborigines to obtain pigment. In the old days
expeditions came from as far away as the coast
of N.Q. to obtain a supply of this red rock. The
ochre was regarded as the blood of a sacred emu
which had been killed by wild dogs, and much cere-
mony was observed in approaching the mine. As
a party of ochre-seekers drew near they discarded
all their belongings, and at a signal began to run
towards the hill. They passed boulders supposed to
represent the dogs which killed the emu, and at
these they cast stones. When the mine was reached
they cut off their beards, which had been permitted
to grow For the purpose, and cast them in to
furnish feathers for the great emu. Then they
filled their bags w'ith ochre and ran full speed from
the place, not stopping even to pick up a bag if
one were dropped.
* * * *
“Mary Scott”: A mild sensation was
created in Mackay (Q.) last week when an abo.
youth walked through the. streets followed by a
dingo and a mincing brolga. The animals were quiet
and well controlled, and responded with comical
promptness to the native equivalent for “right turn’'
and “’bout face.”
* * * *
“B. Temple” : A Darwin man owns what
must be one of the most remarkable pairs of
buffalo horns in the world. ln>tead of the usual
short curls, these grew straight out horizontally
from the animal’s head, and measured 12ft. lOin.
from tip to tip, the last 6in. being curved at
right angles to the front. How the unfortunate brute
managed to get about the bush without breaking
his neck beats me.
* * * *
“J.H.S.”: Tell “Fana” (B. 30/4/’25)
that the pure black dingo always has white on the
breast, white paws and a white-tipped tail. There
can be little doubt that this is the natural marking
of an unadulterated black warrigal, markings which
persist even in the quarter strain. All the dusky
howlers that I have seen had these variations of
color, and pretty well all of them were 100 per
cent, native dog. I don’t hold the view s n*;elf that
the black dog is a distinct but
incline to the melanism theory. 1 If black
dogs were a distinct species, there would be
more of them, and they would occur in bands in-
stead of in occasional specimens only. I remember
once seeing a blac ? k bitch with four half-grown red-
yellow whelps, showing not a trace of a black hair.
As a rule, the black dingo, a very handsome 1 dog,
is much larger and bolder than the average calf-
killer.
Atherton : On my first visit to Darnley
Island the niggers were savage; but this did not
prevent ine poking my nose inside one of their
beehive-like huts. As I became used to its hazy
darkness I found the smoked mummy of the hut
owner’s late missus standing lashed to the centre
pole, a spear propping up her chin. Hubby had
gouged her eyes out and in their place set pieces of
mother-o’-pearl, with a rough imitation of the
pupil painted on them. The naked mummy was
blacky-brown, shrivelled, hideous and skeleton-like,
later I learned that the islanders used to take
THE PHILOSOPHY OF COMBO.
“How is it we had no droughts like this when we were kids,
Comho?”
“Ah, white phella come along dig it well. Big phella God nay, ‘All
right, white phella: you so plurry smart, you carry on!'”
away the interior organs and, stretching the body
upon a wooden frame, lash it upright to a post.
As the houses are grass or palm-thatched to the*
ground, with only a small opening for entrance
and exit, the departed soon became thoroughly smoke-
dried, and the several I’ve seen would undoubtedly
keep for years. In those great days the dead persen's
tongue would be eaten by the nearest relative and
the liver and kidneys by the male relations, with
the universal nigger idea of “making ’em brave.”
Of course when white Gub’ment came along, these
customs were stopped, but the niggers slyly say
it hasn’t yet stamped them all out.
# * * *
“Grigatre”; “Troophorse” (B. 14/5/’25)
is in error. The rainbow never casts a reflection on
water. He is not, however, the only person who
has made this mistake. Quite a number of well-
known artists have done it.
“Jimmy Ducks”; Tell “Jimmy Possum”
that we had ants—the little black ones —in everything
and were nearly selling out, until someone told us
to buy a shilling’s-worth of tartar-emetic and try
that. The method was to put about a dessertspoonful
of honey into a shallow tin-lid, then mix into it
about as much of the acid as could be held on
a threepennybit and smear the mixture in the track
of the ants. We did this and have not seen an
ant since. But you’ll have to be careful to keep
the mixture well out of the reach of children, as
it is a potent poison.
* * * *
“Ted” : At a country bazaar I saw recently
what I think must be a record. A candle-lighting
competition was one of the attractions, and a
girx entrant lit 54 candles with one ordinary
match. Can any Abo. better that?
* * * *
“Gouger” : A. N.Q. nigger showed me the
quickest and easiest method of water-drilling I've
ever come across. The country was very dry, but
a clump of pandanus palm stood out as a sign.
The buck rammed his spear down five feet between
the palm roots. The spear tip came up moist. He
then pulled a handful of grass and rammed it down
the spear hole with the haft. He pulled a long
g’rass reed, and invited me to have a suck. The
Water was deliciously cool and clean; the grass
acted as a filter. This same buck showed me how
at tinus the butt of a grass-tree will bulge. Cut
this with a tomahawk and a thirsty man gets a pass-
able drink.
* * * *
“Up Top” : In a North Queensland scrub
I saw' a defunct carpet-snake that had come a
great thud. Its coils were round a porcupine whose
tough quills had pierced the snake in many parts.
11: had evidently tightened around old Pore., who
had then got the spike. The ant-eater wasn’t in-
convenienced more than to appear a bit tight-
laced, and I suppose he’d carry on that way until
decomposition caused the corset to drop off.

Governor Stradbroke held his last levee
on the King’s birthday at State Parliament
House. Most of those who attended were
public men or officials. The millinery was
mixed. The Light Horse uniform of Colonel
Bourchier, Minister for Agriculture, quite
outshone the tweed sac suit of his political
chief, John Allan; and the K.C.M.G. star
tried hard to relieve the gloom of the under-
taker’s frock-coat that Alec Peacock wore.
Judicial robes, University gowns and naval
and military garb harmonised with or
screamed at the turkey red of the dais. Half
an hour or so served for the handshaking.
Pew had to lose any time as lunch-hour was
lixed for the function. By the time the
royal birthday comes round again Lord
Stradbroke will be back at Henham Hall in
the Cold Land wondering how he stood it
so long.
The loan system between Britain’s Navy
and Australia’s is a great success —from
woman’s point of view. Authorities over-
seas evidently manned 11.M.5. Concord with
the pick of the fleet, for so many good-
lookers and charming men, from the gallant
Captain A. R. Woods, H. 5.0., downwards,
have never put into Melbourne port before
—except in a movie him. That, anyway,
was the vote of the matrons and misses at
the informal farewell hop aboard the ship
the other night. It was a very homey party,
and though rain pattered through the flag-
enclosed quarter-deck, notwithstanding the
efforts of a gay loot to jug the flow, 150 of
the city’s smartest had a perfectly lovely
time. Gum leaves and pink heather prinked
up the ship and supper-tables, where visitors
were regaled with lobster salad and a bit
of bird. The happening was just a little
return from captain and officers to the folk
who had extended them welcoming hands.
Flocking was short and beady. Among the
glad-ragged were Mrs. Norman Brookes, in
sheathing of cerise and gold brocade, much
feathered; Mrs. O’Dell Crowther, wearing
nattier blue criss-crossed with sparkling
beads; Wilma Clarke, whose black scintil-
lated with tissue and crystal; and Jocelyn
Purves-Smith, whose all-bead goldfish robe
terminated in points of Oriental embroidery.
One family party included Donald Mackin-
non, his other half, and daughters Mrs. J. S.
Reid and Marie Mackiunon. Simon Staugh-
ton, one of Victoria’s best-known pastoralists,
walked in the wake of his Canadian wife,
whose amber gown was all asparkle. Sybil
Irving’s black apparel was brightened with
a shiny tassel. Captain Gayer Phipps, R.N..
brought along his miniature-painter wife, ;
study in royal blue and gold. Captain and
officers of H.M.A.S. Tasmania and Parra-
matta, Paymaster-Captain Treacy and other
naval and military folk were of the guests.
“The Lady,” a bellowdrama of the weepiest
description played in an atmosphere of
naughtiness, received a warm, tearful wel-
come at the Theatre Royal on Saturday. The
garmenting goes back to 1898, when women
had some shape other than that supplied by
scaffoldings of rubber. Pauline Frederick,
the Lady, begins her chequered career in
the short, mucli-flared silk frocking of the
ballet-girl of the period; and true lovers’
knots in black sequins wander over its cherry-
red surface. The supporting lasses are simi-
larly clothed in pale gold. Another of the
leading lady’s wearings is sprigged muslin,
lace-frilled, umbrella-trained and blue-and-
pink ribbon-sashed, her leghorn hat planted
with pink roses and waving a blue streamer.
All this is in violent contrast to the coral-pink
glace silk, high-collared garment traced with
black, upon which glitter the diamonds of
iniquity flashed by June Elvidge. Unlike
most deserted heroines, Pauline never loses
her millinery; even when Fate leads her to
sell flowers upon a church doorstep, she is
hatted and not shawled. Nor does the usual
hymn and organ voluntary flood the fog. The
curtain descends in darkness, enabling hand-
kerchiefs and powder-puffp to be applied be-
fore lights went up on Saturday upon a stage
crowded out with garden stuff. Pauline wept
“Thank you,” and June Elvidge echoed it in
smiles.
The wind blew cold across the face of the
sun on Saturday, the first day of the Birth-
day Meeting at Flemington, and every variety
of pelt was worn, from the £450 mink coat
dangling tails to the rabbit neckwear at
19s. llfd. The mink aforesaid was recently
the pride of a Bourke-street mannequin
parade. The fair-and-rarely-forty sex has
suddenly burst forth into the wildest extrava-
gance regarding skin-covering; scores of
wraps that swept the lawn represented
cheques for over the century—yea, twice and
thrice that figure. The flapper Avas uniformed
in wrapped coat, teased wool or fur-edging oi
knee-length above hose of sunburnt hue allied
to small felt millinery. Cinnamon and tan
tones in coats and hats Avere first favorites,
and a rose-red headpiece was among the
placed. Patrons in focus got an extra thrill
•when a scene was shot for Louise Lovely s
picture “Jewelled Nights,” Avliich had the
members’ old stand for background. Among
an attendance that was not great, the com-
mittee’s womenfolk included the president s
half, Mrs. Allan Currie, Mrs. L. Mackinnon,
Mrs. W. Winter-Irving and bride-elect
daughter Joan, Mrs. Norman Falkiner, and
Mrs. Ronald Gordon and sister Grace Byron
Moore, who have just got back from a two
and a half years’ sojourn in the Yeast. Mrs.
Murray Jones, whose husband Avas defeated
last Aveek in the Leg. Council elections,
aired some beautiful Kolinsky, and Mrs. Dick
Turnbull had a bit of sable. Mrs. Barry
Thompson and June Elvidge were also ex-
ceedingly well wrapped.
Until after they had done, it Gov-
ernor Stradbroke and the Ministers Avho
attended an Executive Council meeting
last week were unconscious of the fact that
they had formally sanctioned the proclama-
tion of a new Lovers’-lane in Moorabbin.
And appropriately the lane leads to Church-
street.
Celebrations at the Sacred Heart Convent,
Malvern, in honor of the raising to saint-
hood of the foundress of the Order were
carried out on an elaborate scale. The pro-
gramme presented by the students before
many visitors included tableaux depicting
scenes in the new saint’s life. A girl Avho
had been one of four virgins carrying white
lilies in one picture delighted some visitors
when, in an interA r al, she rushed to her
parent remarking, “Mother, I’m not virgin
now —I’m only just one of the angels.”
Melbourne’s National Gallery art-students
had «x ball on B riday night at. St. Ivilda
Town Hall, which people acquainted with
Sydney’s reA'els of the same name might have
mistaken for a church service. A policeman
wandered around casting a suspicious eye
upon she or he who carried dancing-shoes
in a brown-paper parcel, but there Avas very
little except physical, exercise to warm the
traveller who had breasted the cold and the
rain. Decorations ran to very effective
posters of pierrots, at which even London art
critics couldn’t point their virtuous fingers.
Nevertheless, in spite of all repressions,
several abandoned youths were to be seen
wandering around the ballroom puffing cigar-
ettes ; and the frocking of the modern flapper
is quite sufficiently undressed for the Mel-
bourne climate. Artist John Longstaff pre-
sided over the committee, of which Mrs. D.
S. Andrews was lion. sec.

in Maoriland, married a Christchurch girl,
and, returning to England, became Lord
Rector of Glasgow University, a distin-
guished member of the House of Commons
and a several-times Minister. Geoffrey
Duffield, scientist in general, and meteorolo-
gist in particular, Avho has a job at Canberra,
is a brother of composer Kenneth.
The vestibule of the Windsor Hotel looked
like a pasar in Batavia one afternoon last
Aveek when president Mrs. Norman Brookes
and the committee of the Queen Victoria
Hospital passed around musical tea and cake
in exchange for hospital linen. The Tallis
lady, in nutmeg-broAvu coat and millinery,
and her shadow-worker, Mrs. W. M. Robins,
suited in leaf-patterned black satin with a
dash of gold, collected a mountain of parcels
and also a bit towards the institution’s bank-
ing account. Mayoress Bruntou, arrayed in
black with a cheer-o of Oriental tissue, was
handed the usual floral greeting by Mrs.
Brookes, whose figure was encased in sable
raiment, and who had the chief partying
table. Such a gathering of the womenfolk
of Melbourne’s new nobility was never seen
before, and amid the untitled 500 who almost
obscured the table decorations were Mrs.
A. V. Hiskens, president of the Women’s
Hospital; Mrs.. Lauchlan Mackinnon, ditto
of the Children’s; sundry suburban Mayor-
esses, Drs. Constance Ellis and Georgina
Sweet and Mrs. J. Gilruth. whose girleen
marries into the Austin family this month.
Of the melody-makers were Eileen Castles,
Valerie Walsh and Joseph .Foster, with
fiddler Cecil Parkes; and June Elvidge, air-
ing a French-American accent and some
black velvet allied to white fur, was the idol
of the attendant flappers.
Here is a Lafayette picture of artist Mrs.
Phillips Fox, so well known in Melbourne that
wo look upon
her almost
as an Aussie.
She used to be
Ethel Carrick,
an English
painter of
some stand-
ing, an ex-
student of the
Slade School,
and she first
came this way
in 1908. After
the death of
her artist hus-
band in 1915.
she went back
to England,
where war-
work claimed
her. Wit h
Madame de
Marquette she
organised a
plan for the entertainment of Dominions
soldiers in French homes, Madame Poin-
care being a co-worker. Now she is endea-
voring to rouse Aussie sympathy for the
thousands of Russian refugees—including
princesses—who are moneyless in Paris. She
suggests that private citizens send money
to purchase articles in painted wood, em-
broideries and such like which these people
can make. The idea seems a happy one for
everybody, and the philanthropists are likely
to get good value for their outlay. The New
Gallery at present houses an exhibition of
Mrs. Fox’s pictures. Later she will have a
show in Adelaide, and August will find her
in Sydney.
Hymen is working overtime this month,
but had time to look in at Scots Church,
Collin s-street, to supervise the wedding of
Dorothy Younger and Stanley J. Gardiner,
who owns pasture lands around Chatswood
(Vic.). The bride’s parents have much
acreage at Warrnambool. The lady came in
a creation from Molyneux of Paris (ordered,
bless you, by cable) ; the soldier costu-
miere fitted her out in velvet of parch-
ment hue over pink with ecru Venetian lace
insertions. Sister Mardi. who has a leaning
towards art, and Patti Youngman ’maided;
they slipped nicely into the decorative
scheme in georgette in maize and rose, with
poke bonnets to tone. Trainbearers were
Sheila, daughter of the Charles Armytage
pair, of Coleraine, and Dorothy, chick of Mr.
and Mrs. Carlos Gordon; they were pictures
in gold lace and coalscuttle millinery, rose-
adorned. Rejoicings were at No. 9 Darling-
street. Bridegroom’s mother came over from
South ’Stralia, along with her daughter, Mrs.
A. R.ymill, for the event. Most of the elabo-
rate trousseau was made in Venice.
The good old days, when mummers were
looked upon distrustfully as such gay dogs,
have gone beyond recall. Peep into a dress-
ing-room during the performance of a certain
musical comedy, and there you will find two
male members of the company busy knitting
sweaters for themselves as they await the
callboy. The conversation is all of purl and
plain. Thus has winter and the h.c.l. made
knitters of us all.
Mr. and Mrs. Harry Kirkby showed the
other night that quite a nice hop can be
accommodated in a flat, if you use the whole
of it. The coming-out of their only chick,
Edna, was the motive. Pink roses and leaves
with crystals glistened upon the girl’s white
sheathing; while an ermine stole gave an air
of affluence to the black gown of the hostess.
The Hennessy lady, robed in black, with
daughters Sylvia and Lurlinc, was of the
company; Fairlie Kelly, Rose and Amy
Patterson, and Sybil Bowes Kelly also.
Artist W. B. Mclnnes and his wife, who
are off to London with the proceeds of many
(Archibald prizes, have been duly supped and
teaed. Fellow wielders of the brush and
palette dined the portrait-painter last week,
and on Thursday Mr. and Mrs. A. O.
Barrett decked their home with marigolds
and autumn foliage for a farewell shivoo.
The Vic. branch of the Australian Federa-
tion of Uni. Women is rejoicing over Dr.
Ethel McLennan’s international fellowship
for research. It is the “Scandinavian” dis-
tinction founded by the American Associa-
tion of University Women in recognition of
the good time the Danish, Finnish, Norwegian
and Swedish Federations gave them at the
International Conference at Christiania in
1924. This feminine federation embraces
the graduates of 20 countries, but since its
formation about four years ago Australia’s
applicants, though patted on the back, never
got any plums. Dr. McLennan can carry on
her year’s research at any ’Varsity of the
Federation other than those of her own
country, a condition which is attached to
all these awards. The successful Aussie
is one of the five women Doctors of Science
in Australia.
Countess Stradbroke showed interest in the
Social Service Auxiliary of the Melbourne
Hospital by presiding at the first yearly
casting-up on Friday. Hilda Morris, who
has been in the Great Smoke for the past
11 years, told how hospitals over there em-
ploy trained social-service workers termed
almoners, who are paid and have the assist-
ance of voluntary workers. Countess Strad
broke shed valuable suggestions for further
extending the scope of the S.S.A.
For the next four wintry months kiddies
at various State schools, kindergartens and
R.G. primary schools will be warmed with
half a pint of soup at 11 o’clock, or in the
lunch hour. This is a scheme of the League
of Child Helpers, god-parented by Rupert
Running and Charles Barrett. Voluntary
subscription is relied on to keep the tap
flowing, since no money will be collected from
the scholars. Parents who can afford it are
asked to send, say, 55., which covers the
whole period, but no one save the treasurer
will know if the broth has been paid for or
no. Soup jelly is to be brewed daily at a
kitchen lent by the Glaciarium, and the
Herald has offered to carry on the distri-
bution.
Patriotic films and others brought from
Wembley made a suitable interlude at the
annual rally of the Australian Women's
National League. Priminister Bruce and
Alexander Peacock were amongst the speak-
ers, but in the talk the ladies easily held
their own, President Mrs. H. S. Croker,
Mrs. Claude Couchman and patroness Mrs.
F. G. Hughes, 0.8. E., drawing compliments
from the P.M. for their oratory. Twenty-
one years it is since the A.W.N.L. put on
top the resolution, “Loyalty to God and
Country,” and has worked ever since to keep
it first.
General ,T. W. Parnell, with his wife and
daughter Milly, set out on the London Tiaj
by the Sophocles last week.
Rita Miller, a soprano of good notes and
intelligence, who takes her talents to Italy
shortly for further polishing, is one of the
artists to sing at the cafe chantant at the
Ambassadors on June 13 in aid of the
Catholic Women’s Charity Social Guild.
Miss Adelaide has her say:—
Nine hostesses —among them Katie Teesdale-Smith,
Alison Thomas, Nancy Rymill and Verna Hackett -
combined to give a dance in a marquee in the
It. M. Jays’ garden at Burnside. The flower-massed
rooms gave the lie direct to the notion that this
is an empty time in gardens: sweetpea and delicate
irises, violets and carnations, poinsettia, gladioli and
penstemons were there in plenty, and Chinese lan-
terns lit the cream-and-scarlet walls of the dancing-
tent. Mrs. Jay, in be-crystalled white crepe de Chine,
carried a posy of pink flowers that was the gift of
the hostesses.
With the whole of its books and records reduced
to ashes in the Richards Building, the S.P.C.A.
found enough in the ruins to justify a self-applied
pat on the back. Thirty new junior branches, 150
new subscribers and a balance of nearly £4OO were
some of the reasons. S. J. Jacobs spoke, and
Attorney-General Denny listened blandly to the
society’s opinion of his Government for opening the
duck season earlier than usual.
Rita Coonan, a protegee of Lady Weigall, and for
a time at Melba’s Conservatorium, has been appointed
by the Dame to the staff of that institution. At
the moment she is captivating London, and was one
of the singers at Melba’s last birthday party.
There are rumors of another vacant chair at the
Uni. where economist Heaton is turning over an
offer of Professor Skelton’s empty seat at Queen’s
University, Kingston, Canada.
There was a mayoral reception for G. B. Post
and co., and we’ve farewelled the Boucicaults, alas!
For the last night at the Royal the ascetic Dion,
melted by a record week, relaxed his rule concern-
ing flowers, and the stage at the end was banked
with ’em.
Few girls who’ve gone Londonwards to study have
been better backed at this end than Helene Taylor.
The latest effort was a frivol at Urrbrae, now the
’Varsity’s agricultural annexe, lent by Dr. and Mrs.
Richardson for the evening. Laurence Power and
Patti Connolly provided music, and Mayoress
Glover and the Edward Lucas dame looked after the
bridge. Meantime the local voice-farm continues to
produce the raw material of future warblers—Arnold
Matters, who boasts a delightful baritone, is the
latest.
It took the Exhibition Building to hold the audi-
ence for the State Orchestra’s first concert this
season. Sylvia Whitington is in her place as leader,
and Harold Parsons’s ’cello was a sheer delight.

STOCKINGS
The loyal A.J'.C. presented its Birthday
congratulations to George V. in the form of
a pageant of horseflesh at Randwick. It
lured two complete sets of vice-regals and
brought out every woman with an adorable
new fur coat or neckpiece. A few males
were, to. be se.en, .t 00.,, among the 42,000 scat-
tered about the Padddck, the Beget a lift the
Flat. The vice-regal enclosures were as frill
of humans as a lettuce-leaf of vitamines;
and both the G.-G.’s and the State Exes,
supplied food and lodging to large partie.s.
The Chief Justice Streets, the naval Captain
Robins and Commander Leo Quicks were
with the Forsters’ party, which was bright-
ened by the lacquer-reds tangled in Mrs.
Dudley Gibson’s frocking. Lady Forster
facet! tin; almost summer day in a topcoat
of stone-grey velours warmed with skunk.
Lady de Chair covered leaf-brown marocains
with a fur coat that was positively opulent,
while the State Skipper’s little daughter
topped cream tailorings with a black hat of
hatter’s plush. Mrs. Tony Hordern was the
sartorial crescendo of the official stand: a
coat of Russian sable —at any rate to the
uninitiate it looked like, that —purred over
bigaf-bfown ffbcking, While. ft hat like ft
bbmplete ostrich cfdp brooded dvef all:
The facing womari Wants lief .ftmhsemb'ilt
bfoughi very close liHme, judging by the pdoi;
bally, at Warwick Fafm. Even tlib motored
sisterhood, for the gfeatcr part, gave tlje
bold course the cold shoulder; the intrepid
punters who did face the bite in the air did
it in tweeds and furs and topcoats, fancy
only flowering in the felt hat, small and gay
of hue, that is seen everywhere, particularly
in powder blue. Blue hats are so easy
to wear they are almost complexion-proof;
the skyey blues are no longer reserved for the
debs, but have been filched along with the
palest shades of pink by the ever-growing
battalions of won’t-grow-olds.
The Feminists turned their monthly at-
home into a levee for president Miss Preston
Stanley last week. That intrepid lady, snug
in the woolly coat and Napoleonic headgear
that have clothed her march to political vic-
tory, almost dropped a tear when the whole
big assembly-room sprang at her with a rous-
ing ‘‘She’s a .Tolly Good Fellow.” Dashing
suspicious moisture from an otherwise
dazzling eye, Miss Stanley gave evidence of
her determination to stand shoulder to
Shoulder with mere mail, f’or her hanky was
of the practical sheer-linen variety, ftltd nolle
of yOur flimsy chiffonries that you tuck in
your ring or up your glove. There was music
tangled up with the congratulations, and
tea, and Mrs. Harold Vale presided over a
programme in which Dorothy Ewbank and
Palmer Kent were outstanding turns, Palmer
Kent’s Own composition concerning gulls at
Coilaroy catching the imagination of the
assembly to encore-point.
Sydney, from the Governor-General’s lady
to Constable Chuck, went to the Movie Ball
last Week, The young man has a scent for
the underhand drink as pronounced as that
of the trained hound for the darkly-flowering
truffle. With ft grim humor, too, he went
to the dance as the Shah of Persia who the
legend telis US
Drinks whisky bitters night and day
And only pauses in his drink
To throw the lemons in the sink.
But,, any way, the chucking out was con-
ducted with such decorum that 2800 other
jazzers seemed entirely unaware of it. The
oblivion may have been the assumption of
perfect ladies and gentlemen, but was more
probably due to the sartorial intoxication
which comes when thin-legged men become
the toreadors and the Don .Tuans of devas-
tating fancy, and billowing ladies swagger
as gaily breeched page and student.
The ball, apart from showing itself some-
thing in the nature of a third cousin to the
Artists’ Ball of which the Palais proprietors
so strongly disapproved last year, had no
blot on its ’scutcheon. It was gay and
debonair and tremendously spectacular, for
of course the revels were of the “fancy”
variety, and fancy seemed to have wandered
in strange and far fields to pluck its carnival
ideas. The sets arranged by the film houses
were eye-arresting as they grouped them-
selves on the stage in the middle of the big
floor. The Cafe in Cairo was at once the
most original and colorful —-rather like a
clever Rix Nicholas crayon. Each person
in the set represented a customer at the cafe
—“there were veiled Indies, mid sheiks and
Aussies and u Nubian donkey-driver with
his gently-pacing moke. From the Universal
came the Hunchback, with his train of human
spidei-S hnd flies caught in the web of Hugo’s
wbrld-ebndUei'ing imagination. Dashing girl
aviators trundling a real aeroplane carried
dut the Lyceum Slogan,- ‘‘Above All,” Ihe
beautiful Miss Gunnings and the belles of
Bath represented the Crystal Palace ;- Beau-
caire find his train came on frdm the Prince
Ed Wal'd; and Australian Films brought their
own picture-show, under a strong guard of
Kangaroos, right into the midst of the made-
in-Americas: dUck-ie GdoganS and Tom
Mixek and Harold Lloyds wet'e' at every
turn, and thfe greatest eOmedian Of them all,
C harlie Chaplin, was there at least six times
over.
The gate-money is to be divided between
the Children’s Hospital and the Crown-street
Women’s Hospital; and Lady Forster, who
has always been a keen worker for Crown-
street, was Queen of the Masque. Very
lovely she looked, too, in her gold and blue
brocades finished off with one of the new
softly floating ostrich neckpieces. With her
cannj Miss Carleton and Captain Brooke.

On a still, chid and blue' afternoon lust
week the Infants’ Udine at Aslifield ecle-
bra ted its sUtli birthday by holding its annual
meeting on its pleasant balco’niCS aiid lawns,
Enthusiasm boiled over in a record fOll-up,
and this made the absence of sick president
Mrs, MacCallum more regretted. Her mantle,
however, was worn by daughter Mrs. Ligli-
toller, who. with 1 )r. Constance D’Arcy, Pro
lessor Mills and Attorney-General Tom
Bavin, did the honors of a meeting which
was presided over by Lady Eorster. The
good deed of the afternoon was the decision
to present the home with a new wing for
motherless babies, while the laugh that is
very close to something else greeted Di
D’Afcy’s story of a small boy of the Horn
wild, Oh presenting U posy to visiting vice-
i'oyalty, tlifuSt the flowers into Lady do
GiiaiPs iianflsj Saying; “I’ve got my new

Tin; young Old Boys of the Millions Club,
spafking in. six cylinders, Set their first ball
rolling at the' Ambassadors the other night.
The joll-d wUS in . the catfSe Of . art, and the
spoils from tlie night gO to building up the
club’s art reserves. Judging ffoiri the roll-
up at least two Australian artists will be
enriched by a Millions Club cheque during
the shows that bloom in the Spring. Presi-
dent of tlie Club Arthur Rickard came with
his lady, who wore georgette patterned with
chenille in tones of orange. Her neighbor
at table being Thomas Henley, it was an-
other example of all things working together
for good. Another graceful figure among the
Mighty was Mrs. Aubrey Hallorau, in softest
rose georgettes, gently weighted with crystal.
The art enthusiast Thomas couple brooded
over the gathering, her pretty head suggestive
of a delicate pencil drawing rising from blue
and silver mist. Dr. Horsfall danced with
a rosily-draped daughter, and the West-
brooks, who now inhabit the old H. D. Mcln-
tosh establishment at Darling Point, enter-
tained a large party.
Sidney Riley’s camera has caught this im-
pression of Sister Parry, secretary of the St.
John Ambu-
lance Society.
The St. Johns
have of late
been extend-
ing their circle
of good works,
and have
formed auxili-
aries of the
younger set.
Their chief
work will be
in the promo-
tion of social
activities such
as the Polo
Ball of last
month. But
behind the
pretty flutter-
ings is the
cunning hand
of the organ-
iser ; and this
is the domain of the clever and energetic
subject of the picture.
Who said little girls don’t sew these
times? Let the calumniator go out to Grace
Brothers’ and on the third floor he will find
thousands of contradictions done in the finest
stitchery. Every year the big store holds a
Women’s Industries’ Exhibition and each
year snares some potentate to make the
opening speech. One time Jascha Heifetz
was lured to Broadway, only to flee precipi-
tately when mamma discovered that the place
was a department store! This year, needless
to say, it was Sydney’s new woman M.P. who
addressed the craning multitude standing
hypnotised before phalanxes and cohorts of
embroideries —white and colored —woven of
linens and silks that made the spine of the
onlooker crinkle with ecstasy. Over 100
supper-cloths alone dazzle the eye. But
these work-displays no longer hold the un-
expected delights that a few years ago were
wont to amaze the raptured gaze. One
nightie, which the girl across the way always
refers to as “the mother of all living,” had
its top of filet, and embroidered on its back
and front was a perfect specimen of a cow!
Needless to say it came from the South
Coast,
The small girl and boy will be the ultimate
beneficiaries of the new training-college for
Kindergarten teachers at Waverley. Wood-
lawn—such is its sylvan name —was un-
latched by the Governor-General’s lady on a
Sunny afternoon last week, her path to the
front door being lined with a guard of girls
Who Oit first sight seemed a beauty chorus,
but turned out to be the newest clutch of
Kindergarten teachers. One of these buckled
on to Lady Forster a nosegay of violets,
while another girded her with a gold key.
Thus twice armed the Vice-Heine made her
onslaught, and the front door fell open at the
first attack. Child-lovers were at the func-
tion in large numbers, and cymbals were
clashed to the honor of Woodlawn’s princi-
pal, Miss Dumolo, and such ehieftainesses of
the movement as Miss Desailly and Mrs.
Francis Anderson. Other sort of music
was provided by a brass band, and the tea,
somewhat tempered by the cool sea breeze,
Was consumed upon the lawn.

member when the water-carrier called at
her mother’s door almost as regularly as the

the reason why the limited funds of the
Victory Association have such elastic quali-
ties.
The Women Painters, after counting up
the loot from their very successful exhibi-
tion, determined to “blew” some of it on a
night out at the Wentworth. And last week,
with a rose in the ear where the brush is
abstractedly stuck when the flat bell rings
unexpectedly, the women of paint struck on
colored labor, and dashed into a wild vortex
of jazz and fruit-cup. Artist Ellis St. John’s
wife had secretaricd the frivol, and must have
developed something close to writer’s cramp,
judging by the ballroom’s population. Sable
velvets failed to suppress the gladsome note
struck by Mrs. Guy Boucher’s jazz-cap,
which also proved a luck-bringer, dropping
a prize in the lady’s hand. Ethel Stephens,
who is the president of the painting sister-
hood, brought a large party, and shimmered
in black-sequin ed georgettes. Mrs. Jack
Talbot flashed gold brocades, and treasurer
Mrs. Manning was another devotee of black.
Notables like Mayoress Cecilia Walsh and
tenor Alfred O’Shea kept the balance be-
tween civic weight and Bohemian levity.
The poor old floor of the Wentworth wasn’t
given an hour off last week. Everybody
seemed to have conspired to dance there
either in the afternoon or through the even-
ing. St. Ignatius Old Boys were among the
revellers: “Billy” Coyle, K.C., was president
of this year’s committee, and Mrs. Coyle,
armored in beaten silver, brought two tall
daughters, and hostessed a large party, which
included a representative from almost every
big public school of Sydney. The McElhones
signed chits for another tableful, and the
Foy clan had a night-out in gorgeous raiment
and umpteen-carat diamonds. Treasurer
John Boylan and his wife were among the
hosts of an evening that was one of the
gayest and most crowded of the week.
Santa Sophia, the new Catholic Women’s
College within the Uni., will pay a bit off
the bricklayers’ hill with the toll for entrance
to the Ambassadors on August 5. The ball
is being engineered by a committee strong in
youth and enthusiasm, and already various
entertainments to clear the expenses of the
great night are being arranged. The first
will be a card party at the Australia on
July 10.
A Saturday diversion better than the pic-
tures has been discovered by young Sydney.
It’s the matinee for kiddies instituted by
Arundel Orchard, and started on its way
last week-end. The hall was crowded to the
door with excited youngsters, who listened
just as keenly to Mr. Orchard’s explanation
of the uses of the different instruments as
to the exquisite programme that followed.
This included the “Hansel and Gretel” over-
ture, Haydn’s “Surprise” symphony, Han-
del’s “Water Music” and the Tschaikowsky
“Nut-Cracker Suite.” June 27 is earmarked
for the next matinee.
Sydney Jewry’s protegee, Helene Esserman,
is making progress in her European studies,
and on June 6 was due to appear at the
Theatre Femina, Paris, as Gilda in “Rigo-
letto,” tenor Charles Hackett being in the
cast; and next month she is to appear in
leads in “La Boh&me” and “Madame Butter-
fly.” The triumph of this new voice has
awakened joy in the Bathurst-street second-
hand shop where her parents, brother and
sisters have been waiting for the news. When
Melba spoke her approval of Miss Esser-
man’s voiQe the wealthy of Israel got to-
gether and pledged themselves to provide
for three years sufficient money to enable the
voice to be groomed and developed in Britain.
It is a good thing to be a child of Israel if
you happen to have a talent that needs
expensive polishing.
Another of the ex-Justice Sly girls glided
all sail spread into matrimony midway
through last week. It was Nerida, the bud
of the family, and si re cheered Trinity
Church, Strathfiold, with a crepey garment
rich in gold embroideries and a pink-lined
train, the whole topped by a silky mist of
veil. The man in the case was John Steven-
son, of Ivillara, who was strongly supported
by Merton Loxton, while the bride’s ladies-
in-waiting showed a crescendo of jubilation
in their raiment of georgettes, shaded to
look like the Fitzroy gardens, with the yel-
lows and reds of autumn splashed over them.
Wirringulla, the Sly home at Strathfield,
staged the congratulations against a back-
ground heavily upholstered with wedding
gifts, bride’s mother hostessing in black
chiffon velvet and lace.
Here’s Brisbane now :
Sir Matthew returned to Brisbane on the 3rd and
at once gave a dinner party in honor of George V.
to two archbishops, three mayors, a number of
Ministers of the Crown, several colonels and captains
and Dr. Espie Dods.
On the following night he presided at the meeting
of the Queensland Royal Geographies, when explorer
G. H. Wilkins propounded the startling theory that
there is a direct relation between the rise and fall
of the Brisbane River and Father Nile. He
found York Peninsula a biological desert, but looked
none the worse for living on yams and lily roots.
Allan Wilkie got a rousing reception on King's
birthday night when he appeared trailing his C.B.E.
for .the first time. Brisbane likes the Bard •plus
Wilkie, C.8.E., and the season is to be extended
for another month.
Clear, cold weather greeted Cup day at Ascot.
Mrs. Hunter Bowman (N.S.W.) brightened her coat
frock with Oriental embroideries, and a red hat;
Mrs. A, D. Walsh was in saxe blue; Mrs. Arthur
Clarke wore brown ; Mrs. Cecil Palmer was in navy
marocain with red lights; Miss O’Shea denned a
black satin race-coat; Mrs. J. T. Bell and Mrs.
Real were also in black. Tapestry-brocade was
favored by Mrs. B. Cowlishaw, with a mastic skirt
and almond-green hat.
On Cup night Lennons’ hummed with dinner
parties. For the J. H. S. Barnes’s, whose High-
land won the Stradbroke, brown and pale blue was
the scheme of decoration. On a pedestal of mari-
golds stood a wooden horse in a racing track of
brown and pale blue tulle, flanked with Iceland
poppies, Virginia creeper and maidenhair.
His Gaiters Sharp tied the knot between Holly
Needham-Walker and Andrew Nixon-Smith at St.
Andrew’s, South Brisbane. An arch of palms and a
white wedding-bell greeted the bride, who carried
white mariette with opalescent and silver embroi
deries and an embroidered veil. Nell Nixon-Smith,
in pastel pink, ’maided; and Leigh Nixon-Smith
best-manned. Finney’s roof-garden saw the feasting
in a holly setting; and Sydney and the Blue
Mountains stage the honeymoon. i
The Returned Soldiers basted a joint for Sir
Matthew while he was at Charleville, and the
Country Women’s Association had its ball in
the evening. Next day tennis at Gowrie station gave
some 60 people a chance to press the vice-regal hand.
The Jubilee festa of the Brisbane Girls’ Grammar
School finished with an eating in the Assembly Hall.
Jean Trundle and Rhoda Felgate helped the elo-
cutionary and musical end of the menu.
For bride-to-be Dorothy Johnston, her sister Mrs,
Bourne gave a party at her Toombul home. The
guest of honor was in brown against a background
of roses and African daisies, while the hostess chose
navy crepe de Chine.
Edith Pechey, who said she would to Tom
Crothers at St. Luke’s, Toowoomba, on the King’s
Birthday, was one of the prettiest brides that oi l
church has seen. White milanese romain, beaded in
silver and white, a georgette train and a bouquet
of pale pink orchids and roses completed the
picture. Eleanor Pechey and Yulie Hobson ’maided
in powder-blue panne velvet; and Laurel Gill and
Joan Pechey, in petal frocks of mauve velvet, carried
the train. Mrs. Dick Gailey, of Brisbane, the
bride’s mother, saw to the jollo at the Club Hotel;
Sydney sees the ’moon.

NOTIONS
Sydney people would enjoy the A.J.C.’s
Warwick Farm meetings more if the train service
were not so bad. On Saturday it was abominable.
However, winners were not so difficult to find
as when the course was reopened in April (on
that occasion one bookmaker showed a profit of
just on £7000), although Pelman (Roseworthy—
Pensee) gave McShortodds a skinner in the Farm
Stakes and returned £23 17s. 6d. for 10s. on the
grandstand tote, which pays three divs. Janitor
(10’s) was another long-priced winner—the odd?
were rather surprising considering his decent third
at Rosehill a week before—but many punters found
Piratic (4’s), Gounod (3’s), Strongbow (6 to 4)
and Hemisphere (s’s) profitable. Strongbow was
running on sturdily at tile end of a mile and a half,
covered in 2min. 35Jsec; and although he had
nothing much to beat except Mirthmaker, who
needed the race, he impressed not a few of tiie
speckers who take early Epsom-Metrop. doubles.
It seldom pays to follow form, but the thing
could have been done on Sydney courses during
the past few weeks. At Rand wick on Monday, it
being the first day of the A.J.C. Winter meeting,
Janitor (10’s) did it again, albeit luckily, in the
June Stakes. Chatterbox (3’s) was a close second,
and had Toohey got her out a trifle sooner she
must have registered her fourth success in four
starts. She travelled much faster than Janitor over
the last hundred yards, after having been pocketed.
Then Hemisphere (5 to 2) romped home in the
Ellesmere Handicap, just as he had done at War-
wick Farm; and Pildin (s’s), likewise successful
in his previous essay, made a one-horse affair of
the £2OOO Hurdle. For some mysterious reason
Les Paddington, who has grown old and slow, was
made favorite for this race, in which nothing
ever looked like bothering Pildin after Royal
Howard’s disappearance near the seven-furlong post,
and perhaps the Queensland Cup winner had had
enough of it when he fell. Jupiter and Roisel
followed the leader home. Palbi (7 to 4) gave a
fine exhibition of fencing in the First Steeplechase,
and pi’omises to be Minterne’e most dangerous
opponent in the more richly endowed event on
Saturday. Pay Day (20’s), ridden by the West-
ralian jockey Darcy, came from a long way back to
earn second money for Phosnix.
* * «• #
A disastrous steeple and a thrilling hurdle
marked the V.R.C. meeting at Flemington on
Saturday. In the affair over the big fences, Berribee
—-usually a trustworthy conveyance—Calimo, Brenda’s
Son and Hannan fell, Parmen ran off, and Sandridge
was so far behind all the way that he didn’t count.
Monrose (4’s) and Tarmoola (5 to 2) led at the
last jump, but the patiently-handled St. Roseland
(7’s) caught them at the entrance to the straight
and thereafter it was no race. The St. Anton —Lady
Rosalind gelding from South Oss. carried his lOst.
51b. as though the extra seven furlongs or so in
the Rational won’t worry him—and then he will
have 4lb. less. And Sir Charles will probably be as
hard to stoush in the National Hurdle, judging
bv his game victory, at 9t02, on Saturday. Though
he knocked several fences hard, Dinsdale always had
him better placed than at Moonee Valley, where he
finished very fast, and H. E. Connelly’s promising
hurdler hit the front quickly when Deacon, the
leader, blundered at the last obstacle. In the
straight the more experienced Pindarus threw out a
strong challenge, but Sir Charles finished stoutly
and just scraped home. A solid commission for
King Pan brought the Shepherd King—Sweet Honey
gelding from s’s to 7 to 2 for the Sandringham
Handicap, 10 furlongs, but the money was left in
the bag. King Pan got badly away and dropped
further behind, whevea-s the second favorite, Duke-
dom (s’s), followed Irish Rhythm—almost ready—-
around the turn and won comfortably from Comedy
Star and Sure. Norman Devereux completed the
programme by landing the Buckingham Welter on the.
horribly named Who’s Mistake, at 15 to 1.
Rahda, who was second to the defunct Jackstaft
in the last G. N. Hurdle, showed on Monday that
he might go one better in the next, if he keeps
right. With list. 91b.—91b. more than his July
4 burden—he always had the measure of his field
in the Marlborough Hurdle, and among the starters
were Bendoe, Pindarus and Parupa. A. C. Colman,
who has had good and bad luck since he returned
from the war, landed a nice stake at s’s and 9 to 2.
Frances Tressady (T’s), an honest member of a
rather uncertain family, showed a return to form
in the Birthday Handicay, outstaying the more
fancied King Pan and Warwickshire.
* * * *
Class told in the two-mile Brisbane Clip.
The plain-looking Maoriland gelding, Te Kara, made
light of his 9st. 101 b., and had two lengths to
spare when the judge was reached; Mountain Song
was second and Alabama, a sister to Prince Bardolph,
third. Owing to rumors about O’Shea not being
well enough to ride a vigorous race, the winner
went to 7 to 2 after 2’s had been taken. Royal
Roue, on whom some scamp had surreptitiously
applied a blister while the world and his keeper
slept, held his place in the market surprisingly
well, and, with Ardglen, was solidly supported at
s’s. Nothing else was wanted for big money. Wee
Glen, full brother to Ardglen, from the successful
Tucker stable, took the Sires Produce Stakes. Casual-
ties were Orrell, a broken arm; and another visiting
jock, fined £2O for “misbehavior.” And the pound
punters walked home in hundreds because Toohey
had failed to land a winner.
Three days after his Brisbane Cup victory, Te
Kara whipped in the Royal Stakes field. At nine
furlongs the Maoriland horse is no match for
Admetus (5 to 4) ; the latter, who was ridden by
Young, won, easing up, from Quintus and Ardglen
in lmin. 50|sec. It is to be hoped that the
brilliant Maltster horse will be brought to Sydney
for the Spring meeting. Ardglen and Talbragalba,
who also started in the Royal Stakes, had previously
run third and second respectively to King Seremond
THE GRAVE OF MANY REPUTATIONS.
PERCY: “Bai Jove, this game is quaite a business undertaking!”
PEACH (as he digs well in): “Looks more like an undertaking
business.”
(20’s) in the Moreton Handicap. King Seremond had
been showing good form among the sprinters, but
it was thought that 10 furlongs might trouble him.
As it turned out, he outstayed Talbragalba and
Ardglen, and left the mile and a quarter behind
in the dazzling time of 2min. llscc.
* * * *
King of Mirth (Comedy King — Little J oan),
who has been pretty useful to R. E. H. Hope,
placed the A.R.C. Birthday Cup to his credit at
Victoria Park on Saturday and paid £6 18s. on
the one-two £1 tote. An excellent price con
sidering that the King had run respectably in
w.f.a. company on the first day of the meeting, and
that there was no doubt as to his staying the
distance, 13 furlongs, which he galloped in 2min.
55sec., the going being bad. Steel Bronze and
Stralia, the Adelaide Cup winner, chased him home,
but he had the field at his mercy a long way from
the end. Two horses well and unfavorably known
at Randwick were among the winners—Friarsdale
in the Maiden Plate and Mountain Lion in the
Jumpers’ Flat. It was Friarsdale’s first success in
Australia, and, as he is only a four-year-old, it
may not be his last; but Otway Falkiner has
found him a disappointing brute.
Valwyne (Valais —Beanbri), who danced away
from a big field of stayers in the Dangar Handicap on
the last day of the A.J.C. Easter meeting, did the
same thing in the A.R.C. Alderman Cup on Monday.
The company was weaker in Adelaide, but the mare
had Bst. 81b., as against 7st. 71b. in Sydney. Old
Dependence and The Storm filled the places, and
Valwyne traversed the 14 furlongs in 3min. i f see
She was favorite, at a shade better than 2’s," on
the machine.
“Shrewsbury”: The definition of profes-
sionalism in sport given by the International Olympic
Conference is to bind all parties to the proceedings,
including Britain. Under it no one can remain an
amateur if lie has received payment for “broken
time, - ’ which means compensation for wages lost
by absence from work. Further, a pro. in one
sport becomes a pro. in all. How is this going to
affect the amateur status of our Australian Xl’s?
The tribulations of Kelleway last season made it
evident that broken time is expected by, and paid
to. at least some Australian cricketers, quite apart
from “honorariums.” The new definition may result
in our players losing the preliminary “Mr.” in the
press reports of the games when next they go to
England ; and if this be the case, members of the
XI who pose as amateurs at bowls, golf, mah jongg
and gardening, will have to submit to the ignominy
of being classed as professionals. There are the
tennis players, too. Press controversies have shown
how important “broken time” is to some of these.
But, since they have their own particular troubles
in this regard, it may be as well to leave them in
their grief.

Rowing in a borrowed boat which they had
to rebuild in part, the Tasmanians won the inter-
’Varsity eight-oar race brilliantly on the Brisbane
River. Sydney w'as second, between two and three
lengths away, Queensland another length or two
behind Sydney, and Melbourne last; time for the
three miles, 17min. 56sec. The Melbourne boat
made the pace for about half the journey, and was
unlucky in getting into a bit of rough water, but
Tasmania’s superiority was decisive.
“Topee”: Forty-five years ago Jim Punch’s
hotel at the corner of
King and Pitt streets,
Sydney, was a favorite
rendezvous of “sports,”
and “man and money
any night at Punch’s”
was a common expres-
sion. Sculling inter-
ests predominated,
and on international
occasions crowds used
to wait outside in the
small hours for cabled
results. (I waited till
3.30 a.m. for the
verdict in the Trickett-
H a n 1 a n event i n
1881.) In minor
sculling matches,
all negotiations were
conducted at the
Honest Lawyer. This
quaint pub, with a
lantern sign depicting
a gowned individual
with his head under
his arm, stood at the
corner of a lane in
Brickfield Hill on the
site now occupied by
Anthony Horderns’
tobacco department.
William George Brett,
the licensee, was for
some years the holder
of the Laidley Diamond
Sculls. He prepared
articles and held stakes
for numerous contests
on which big money
was wagered. In those
days sloops carried
road-metal up and fire-
wood down the Parra-
matta, and their crews
were always ready to
peel off enough notes
from their sweat-
impregnated wads to
cover deposits or make
up stake money. The
river quarrymen were
in no way behind, and
the little parlor would
be packed with huge
men backing their
aquatic fancies. When
the Walker Whisky
Trophy was rowed fot
in 1881 nine matches
were pulled on the
river in a fortnight,
and the room reeked
with excitement and
stale currency. In later
years Brett became a
racecourse detective.
“Nitric”: Melbourne Uni. collected most
points at the inter-’Varsity athletic contests at Bris
bane—-19, as against .Sydney’s 15 and Brisbane’s Hi.
Queensland’s two firsts were gained by W. N.
Harrison, who jumped 22ft. 3in. and ran 440yds.
in 50 2-ssec., breaking by 2-ssec. a record established
by Nigel Barker in 1905. The only other candi-
date to get a double was N. R. Burns, of Sydney, who
notched the 100yds. in 10 l-ssec. and the 220yds. in
22 l-ssec. “Tubby” Dodds (Melbourne), Austral-
asian champion at throwing the hammer, hurled
the weapon 119 ft. 3in. and scored a second with
37ft. 2in. in the other heavy man’s job, the shot
put—it was won by J. Bloomfield, also of Mel-
bourne, with 37ft. 9in.
“Mephisto”: Adelaide Uni. did not send a team to
the Brisbane meeting. Tasmania had a couple of
representatives, but their luck was out; perhaps
Morris would have done better if he hadn’t attempted
so much. Since 1906, when Adelaide joined in
these tests. Melbourne has had nine wins, Sydney
.lx, and Adelaide one. In 1921, Queensland com-
peted for the first time, and on its showing w
week it* will be troublesome in future events. ''
, Pjck Congress (9st.) behaved like a per-
lot g ?Vn ma vr ,V’ his “ fi S ht ” with Bill Grime
(9st. 21b.) at the Melbourne Stadium, doing nothin-
to which Grime could take exception. Grime could
apparently have ended the polite affair am tin.,
alter the filth round, but he dawdled along for the
lull 1 - i ounds and then got the decision There
was. more vigor, if less science, in the argument
between Jerry Monanan (lOst. ljlb.) and Beit
McCarthy (9st. 81b.). Jerry, who looked half a
stone heavier than the announced weight, came to
light with a persistent straight left; and Beit a
lad with some science, allowed this weapon to mak-
contact with his countenance to an extent as sur-
prising as it must have been painful. Monahan was
too strong for his opponent—too strong, also, in his
tactics,; but McCarthy livened up in the last three
rounds and made them his own. Monahan’s long
early lead earned him a victory on points.
“Cron”: Grime is presently to meet Gavino De
Leon, the tedder from Manila. The said De Leon has
a shrewd manager and publicity-agent in Georg.-
Baillieu, who, on N. S. Wales election-day, proudly
introduced his interesting savage to Premier Fullei
“De Leon has met many eminent personages since he
arrived in Sydney,” said Baillieu, to a pressman.
“He was introduced to his Excellency Sir Dudley De-
Chair at Randwick. His Excellency Sir Dudley Rawson
Stratford De Chair, if you get me. Then he met Kreisaer
and millionaire John Brown, and Sir Benjamin Fuller!
Didn’t you meet those distinguished blokes, Gav?”
“Sh-00-re!” replied the Manilaman, who lias little
English. “An’ lick ’em too!”
* * * *
A perfectly-timed left hook which landed
fair on the chin deprived the ageing- Tommy Uren
of his middleweight championship at the Sydney
Stadium on Saturday night. The punch was delivered
by Harry Collins, of Newcastle, who now owns both
middleweight and welterweight titles. In future
he will fight among the middles, and it will take a
good one to vanquish him.

The English Soccer team followed up its
success in the first game against N. S. Wales with
a comfortable 3—l win from a Metropolitan side.
The visitors fielded six new men, of whom Whittaker,
an ex-Army and Woolwich Arsenal player, showed
finely at left back, and Davison, Sheffield Wednesday $
famous goalie, was a tower of strength. England’s
forwards were far too good for the opposing line,
but Aitchison, in goal for Metropolis, aided by the
resolute defending of his backs, Gallen and S.
Robinson, did a lot to keep down England’s score.
The tourists next invaded the South Coast, which
has a reputation for upsetting the records of visiting
sides, Maoriland, Canada, China and Queensland
having crashed there more than once. This time
Illawarra came the crash, and that by 8 to nil—
a horrid hiding in Soccer., England fielded a new
left-inside in Williams, who proved a clinking
forward and a powerful shot. Followed the second
match against N. S. Wales, in which the home side
had the cruellest of luck. Cartwright, its sterling
goalie, was obliged to retire with an injured hand
in the first quarter, and Thompson had to leave the
left wing to take his place. No replacements were
permitted, and the team battled against odds till
Leabeater, one of the backs, was injured. N.S.W.
finished the last quarter with only nine men, three
forwards against five. From the beginning, the
Englishmen played like winners, but the conditions
of the second half gave them every chance. Batten,
at centre forward, with Simms and Elkes, dominated
the play after the opposition was broken, and their
halves continually made the openings. England
finished with four goals to one. All things con-
sidered, it was an unsatisfactory match, and the
big crowd of 40,000 would have liked to see the
local custom of replacing injured men followed.
* * * *
During the week following their triumph
—the seventh in succession—over the elect of N. S.
Wales, the Queensland Rugby Leaguers thrashed
“a” N.S.W. XIII, 27 to 13, and ran up a cricket
score, 56 to 23, against a Newcastle team. But in
the second representative match at the Sydney C. G.
a youthful N.S.W. combinaticn trounced them by
27 to 16, to the astonishment and delight of 32,000
barrackers. Only in the initial 15 minutes did the
Northerners prevail; after that, the Blues ran them
off their legs. The match was a personal triumph
for Wearing, the South Sydney wing three-quarter,
who got three tries and six goals (21 of the 27
points). In one dazzling bit of work he dummied
half a dozen opponents and scored a brilliant try,
right between the posts. The Blue forwards were
superior on the day to their bigger and heavier
opponents, and Justice, the hooker, gave those
behind the pack excellent chances. Johnson, a fair-
haired and very nippy half-back, excelled even the
great Duncan Thompson, and Breen (also a promoted
reserve-player). Rule and O’Rourke were others who
distinguished themselves. Not. for years have the
two Queensland centres, Gorman and Craig, had so
tempestuous a time. Paten was the best of the
Reds’ back division, and it wasn’t the fault of
Bennett, Potter and Armbruster, among the for-
wards, that the team went down. The proudest men
in Sydney after the match were the members of the
League selection committee, who had been bitterly
criticised for picking eight new men, particularly
Daisley, the full-back, Breen and Johnson. All three
were juniors last season.
* * * *
None of the three Melbourne League
games staged on Saturday showed much science or
pretty play, but there were two exciting finishes.
About 40,000 enthusiasts from everywhere pushed
themselves into the small Richmond ground to see
the local Tigers eat Melbourne alive—-or vice versa.
As it turned out, neither team was consumed, the
Red Legs notching 10 goals 10 behinds to the
Tigers’ 9 goals 16 behinds. This left honors divided,
but Richmond went home with a disgusted feeling
that a scrap of decent kicking would have given
it the game. North Melbourne won a hard but
unmannerly scuffle from Hawthorn—6l points to 57 ;
and Geelong visited Footseray and waltzed over
the foe to such purpose that after the first change-
over—Geelong 46, ’Scray 9 —the soul had gone out
of the business. At the close, Geelong possessed
83 points to ’Scray’s 62. During the week the
League’s tribunal dealt with a Hawthorn player
who had insulted an umpire, and gave some pro-
tection to those harassed individuals by passing
the offender out for the rest of the season.
NO DEAD ’UNS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“When caucus meets, the ballot for portfolios will
be keenly contested, for there are few Labor members
who do not personally regard themselves as entitled
to Cabinet rank.” —S. M. Herald.
When the middies line up for a trotting event
There are always a few not regarded as “meant,’
They are “out for an airing” or ‘‘working oir
weight”—
Circuitous phrases that all may translate.
They are “dead,” as the betting denotes at a glance,
And nobody gives them the ghost of a chance.
But when Labor’s elect at the barrier abreast
Are ranged the Portfolio Stakes to contest.
Raw colts or proved stayers, rogues, cripples or
fliers,
One thing you can bank on —they’re all of ’em
triers.
When a cricket eleven goes out on the trail
It’s a mighty queer thing if it hasn’t a tail.
Run-getters in posse you’ll easily spot;
But others, you’ll prophesy safely, are not.
Most teams have their “rabbits,” it can’t be denied.
Whose mission is mainly to make up a side,
And who’re fully content, if their worth is revealed
By patient and arduous work in the field.
But when Labor is whacking up Cabinet jobs
Each man should comport him as if he were Hobbs.
When your presence is asked at a function or feast
’Tis fitting—there’s Scriptural warrant at least —-
That down near the foot of the table you stop
Till urged by your hosts to come up to the top.
But no “Friend, go up higher” ’ll be wafted to you
Wnen chairs are annexed for a caucus shivoo
Where office’s sweets are displayed on the delf
Unless you address the remark to yourself.
Here’s one game at last—are there any deniers?—
Where no-one is “stiff” and the roughest are triers.

SPORTS-LOVING
AUSTRALIANS
The generous sunshine and glorious climate of the
Southern Cross invite all Australians to take an
active part in sport. The life of vigor and activity
which is a national asset has given them the health
and physique to enjoy their heritage of freedom—
full-blood brother to sport.
Every game that Australians take up nationally sees
them in the world’s van of glamor—and their common-
sense is marked by their appreciation of the value
of good equipment in securing the results of their
prowess.
They find in Mick Simmons’ a store that specialises
in everything dear to the sportsman’s heart, and a
store that gives unequalled value and absolute satis-
faction. We feature some of our tennis specials.

THE INKY WAY.
The long-promised Country party paper, the
Morning Post, is timed to see the light in Mel-
bourne before the end of the present year. As an
earnest of its appearance Tom Fitzgerald has been
lured from his sub-editorial chair on the Sun
Pictorial, and will take up the job of running the
weekly Countryman until the daily venture is ready
lor launching. Fitzgerald helped to pilot tlie Sydney
Daily Mail before it became the Labor Daily.
“Gigadibs”: An Inky-Wayfarcr of some note and
adaptability is Archie Whyte, just selected as pub-
licity officer for the Melbourne Tramways Board.
He started on Sydney Daily Telegraph, an 1 then
went to the press gallery of the Federal Parliament
for the S. M. Herald. His next job was that of
general secretary of the National Federation—-his
last was circulation manager of now defunct
Evening Sun.
“Telopea Bay”: The first days of June will see
the sixth issue of Canberra’s monthly journal. The
Federal Capital Pioneer is owned by A. K.
Murray and is the official organ of the Federal
Capital League; it also does its bit towards up-
rooting Communism. The Pioneer claims to be
Canberra’s first journal; but this is , not literally
true, for the secondary pupils of Telopea Park
school issued a magazine about five months prior to
the first appearance of the Pioneer, and the little
mag. is still going strong.
“Simon”; Newspapers can sometimes be too brief
with names and initials. When Dicky Price was
expelled from N.S.W. Parliament some years ago for
barking in the wrong strain at a Minister, the
whole Ministry and most of the Nationalist party
followed him to Gloucester in the hope of routing
him from his seat. A long list of the “invaders’ ”
names was published, “Thos. J. Ley, Esq., M.L.A.,”
being abbreviated to T. Ley. Dicky took advantage
of this. “They’ve even brought Tin Ley up here,”
he said—“a Chinaman that 1 wouldn’t know if tie
put his basket down in front of me.”
Gone on his last .engagement, Hubert G. Mitchell,
brilliant Maoriland writer. Educated in London, he
commenced in the wool business at Bradford, but at
22 the Inky Way led him to Oamaru. Later, the
Lyttelton Times (Christchurch) found that he was
a great hustler for news. One of his most notable
scoops was a big Antarctic story which moved the
London Daily Mail to give him a cheer. He took
a seat in the Parliamentary Press Gallery, toured the
Dominion with the Duke of York, and ended up in
the sub-editorial chair of N.Z. Truth. The book
was closed at 56.
Howard Knapp’s salary will be round about four
figures when he sails for England at the end of
the month. Boulder City’s (W.A.) pixy publication
broke him in. “Bullant” Mclntyre then coaxed
him to Southern Cross.- A rise to the ’ West Aus-
tralian and Perth followed. Labor Papers, Ltd.,
then shipped him to Tassy, to launch the World.
Coming to Sydney unknown in 1919, Knapp started
as a casual on the Evening News and was chief-sub.
within a twelvemonth. In 1923 he toured Europe
and America for his paper, which he rejoined as
news editor last year. He now goes to represent
several Australian newspapers for a five-year; term.
“Hamer”; The just-dead British newspaper mag-
nate Edward Hulton : had a great appreciation of
Australians. He appeared to be on the lookout for
them. I had sent only three paragraphs to the
Evening Standard —unambitious trifles from a mili-
tary hospital—when I received a letter asking for
more, and I was subsequently roped in for an inter-
view with the man himself. He smiled on “Smiler”
Hales, employed an Australian trainer (Richard
Wootton) for his horses, and gave many mounts to
Australian riders. The best luck he ever got from
the turf was his father’s win of £5OO. It enabled
a mere working printer to establish a sporting sheet
in Manchester, which grew into: the Britain-wide
chain of papers; and 18 months ago the son sold
the collection to Lord Rothermere for £6,000,000.
“H.1.M.”; Looks as though somebody has at last got
rather tired of the vigorous press-agenting of Dr.
Bradfiekl, the “builder” of the' Sydney Harbor bridge,
and has made the S. M. Herald the victim of his
leg-pulling. First the old paper published a para-
graph about the ascertainment of the “centre line”
or the bridge. Then appeared a : letter signed “K.
M. Butfield” quoting alleged extracts from the March
(1925) catalogue of Watts and Sons —makers of the
theodolite employed—said extracts being laudatory of
Dr. Bradfielcl’s improvements in the apparatus.
Promptly followed a letter from Watts and Sons’
agent in Sydney declaring that the theodolite was a
standard model, and denying even the existence of a
March (1925) catalogue. Of course, the surveying
fraternity wanted to know who “K. M. Butfield” is.
Apparently some satirist had used for his signature
the joint names of Dr. Bradfield and his secretary,
Miss K. M. Butler, giving the lady the precedence
due to her sex.
“Iford”: Is there any place in Australia which
christened itself a city from the jump except
Boulder (W.A.)? The fiction or pretin ion may
have long been dropped, even by the most patriotic
local resident, but it still survives on the name-
board at the railway station and in the State’s official
• gazetteers. The U.S.A., of course, is full of busted
mining camps that began their existence with such
high-sounding nomenclature (like the Empire City
of “The Goldin Butterfly”), but I can’t recall a
second instance in this country. Boulder put on
its civic robe immediately it was declared a town-
ship, presumably as a method of advertising its
superior attractions to Kalgoorlie, the original settle-
ment. I always suspected “Smiler” Hales, who was
trying to start a newspaper there at the time, of
being the man mainly responsible for Boulder’s
citvhood. “Boulder Town” would have seemed a weak
and unimpressive way of foreshadowing the centre's
immense possibilities to such a soaring optimist
as “Smiler,”
“Oxmead”: The late Rider Haggard must have
continued drawing substantial royalties from the
far-flung romances of his early authorhood right up
to his death, and periodically he would publish some-
thing new about Alan Quaterman; but in his
later years lie strongly resented any suggestion that
his title to fame rested on his imaginative works.
And he disliked having the Haggard who was the
greatest living authority on the English agricultural
iaborer mixed up with the Haggard who wrote best’
sellers like “She” in his lighter moments. Eight
or nine years ago, when the author was touring
Australia in his former capacity and was being
municipally greeted at Perth, the Mayor, a well-
meaning but sadly tactless person who was doubtless
desirous of airing his familiarity with the guest’s
eprly literary achievements, pointed out that, the vast
unexplored tracts in Westralia would make it an
ideal scene for another “King Solomon’s Mines” if
Sir Rider had anything of the sort in view. The
nature of the reply, or, rather, the snub that the
remark elicited, indicated that the visitor had a poor
opinion of the mentality of anyone who would drag
his fictional past into his Imperial mission.

♦—
Never having read Peter B. Kyne, this
Sundry Showman is unable to say whether
“Cappy Ricks” the book is correctly re-
presented in “Cappy Ricks” the play. If
it is, then the Peter B. Kyne formula for
producing titters may be grasped from the
following example garnered from the play:
Cappv Ricks (in thundering voice): “Go to Hell!”
(Person addressed rushes to door.)
Cappy (in chastened tones): “Where are you
going?”
Person: “I’m going to Hell, sir.”
This formula may be varied according to
taste, with other expressions, such as “Go
and eat grass,” the appropriate responses
following the above model. Other weapons in
Peter’s armory are sob-stuff in the Uncle
Tom line of descent; loud shouting, off and
on, and the usual commercial duel, full of
the clank of dollars, between two business
men with hard heads but hearts of gold.
The core of the plot in this case is the
attempt of a chief mate, who has been bru-
tally sacked by the improbable Cappy, to
launch a fleet of his own in competition with
his late employer’s, lie obtains the capital
to do this from Cappy’s daughter, who has
got it from her dad as a contribution to a
missionary society. After some business
manoeuvres which may be in oi’der in IJ.S.A.
but would in this country be regarded as
plain fraud, the chief officer beats his rival
to his financial knees, and by marrying his
daughter unites the fortunes of the two
houses. The chief interest is supposed to lie
in the character of the disingenuous Cappy,
whose hell-fire temper cloaks a sentimental
soul; but as this aspect of his nature is
l-evcaled in the first five minutes, his behavior
in subsequent situations has as much un-

The large audience which turned up at the
first Sydney performance at the Palace
enjoyed having its favorite author flung
at it over the footlights. Ward Lyons,
the Australian actor whose manful efforts
made such a success of the Melbourne season
that the grateful Peter B. has summoned
him to London to star in the initial produc-
tion there, gave a very fair exposition of
the blustering Cappy. He would do well,
however, to intrude a little more business
and overcome a tendency to deliver his lines
with the promptness and regularity of a
cigarette-machine. Hex-bert Stallard, as Matt
Peasley, was a breezy and pugnacious sailor
somewhat out of his element ashore; Walter
Dyer as Cappy’s manager was an extremely
long-suffering butt, and Donald Nicols was a
comic dude. Agnes Cliffoi’d-Barclay imported
good acting and a natural manner into her
part of Cappy’s daughter. A delightful bit
of marine painting figured in the backcloth
in Act 2.
All things must pass, from Asclie s adipose
To Grossmith’s drawl and Moscovitch’s nose;
But still she holds the patrons of the Roy’l
Beneath her spell, “The Lady of The Rose.”
The Sistine Soloists are still filling Sydney
Town Hall with music artistically chosen
and delivered with full atmospheric effect.
The concerts have been a liberal education to
the student, for every class of composition,
grand, comic, sacred and sentimental, has
had its place on the bill, and each soloist is
a master in his own line. The over-fervid*
ness of Paganelli is balanced by his sound
musicianship and the sweetness of liis tone:
while Belli is inimitable in his share of duets
from such operas as “Don Pasquale” and
“The Secret Marriage.” During the season
some good music from the pens of Paganelli
and Casalari, members of the company, have
been given, notably an “Agnus Dei” from a
Mass of Paganelli’s composition. Next week
the choir goes to Newcastle.

Tenor Arthur Jordan drew a crowded
house on Saturday night; and this was as
it should be, for during the week lie had
been making an almost empty King's Ilall
ring like a choir of cherubim. Opera, ora-
torio and modern songs have been offered
with equal facility. Three fairy songs from
“The Immortal Hour” and the fascinating
songs of the Hebrides have made the recitals
memorable in Sydney. Mr. Jordan’s voice
has in an unusual degree the power of con-
veying a sense of the ethereal and fantastic.
But perhaps his most artistic effect is gained
in such songs as “Linden Lea”—as he sings
it, drowsy with sensuous languor.

❖❖ ❖ ❖
Since his last appearance at Sydney Tivoli,
Wee Georgie Wood has cut two birthday
cakes; and while the exact number of his
years continues to puzzle the inquisitive, the
diminutive genius still retains the freshness
and whimsical charm that won him thousands
of barrackers. during his first visit. With
Dolly Harmer, Tom Blackwood and Thelma
Kurtzman, he occupies the whole of the first
half in an appealing study of an English
working-class family entitled “His First
Love.” In it Wee Georgie brings home a
fickle little flapper to tea, and things are pro-
gressing serenely until his “old man,” as
“full as a lord,” enters his castle. A tussle
of tongues ensues in which Wee Georgie more
than holds his own ; ructions follow ructions:
the flapper confesses another lover and is jilted
by Georgie, and the fade-out sees him in the
arms of his mother, a pathetic, humorous
little figure, with the house yelling itself
hoarse. Among the others are Scott Saun-
ders. a Scotch comedian ; and Barclay, the
magician, as mystifying as the proportional
representation system in N. S. Wales.
At Fullers’ this week Con Moreni is the
envy of all the young Romeos of Sydney.
Con is one of a batch of sailors shipwrecked
on an island inhabited by an elderly king
with 300 wives. Despite the fact that he can
almost afford a new wife for every day in
the year, His Royal Nibs is bitten badly with
jealousy, and the bright little revue is full
of sparkling passages between him and the
irrepressible Con. Only about ‘l\ per cent,
of the females are shown, but if they are a
fair sample the king’s dislike for intruders
can be appreciated. In the vaudeville section
notable work is being done by Charles Sher-
man at the piano.
“The Golden Bed” which graces Hoyt’s
screen in Sydney is in keeping with the
majority of Cecil de Mille’s productions—-
bizarre with a barely perceptible thread of
story running through its rich fabric of
elaborate scenes. At the Crystal Palace
Esmeralda is still the most charming heroine
in town, and the Prince Edward gives no
indication of bringing “The Ten Command-
ments” to a finish.
It would be a mistake to call “The Lady,”
which was introduced at Melbourne Royal
on Saturday, a suggestive play; the out-
spoken philosophy and plainly indicated con-
duct of life of most of the characters leaves
nothing to suggestion. Leading off in the
first act with some of the kind of kissing
which on the screen the censor frequently
interrupts, the heart-tearing story introduces
much of the hectic matter which makes so
many American films objectionable; and
the settings of the play, mostly cast in
France, are helped out with numerous frag-
rnents of French, the English being “im-
possible.”
* * * *
The prologue introduces Folly Pearl, grey-
ing and faded, in her Havre estaminet, tell-
ing a sympathetic English traveller the story
of her life; and so the action skips back
23 years to Act 1, in which Polly is seen
in her dressing-room at the Finsbury Empire
nursing an ambition to remain virtuous and
a hope to some day be a lady, in spite of
the very plain views upon the wisdom of
realising the merchantable value of their
charms entertained by the women around
her, particularly her chum, Fanny Le Clare.
“GAPPY RICKS," AT
SYDNEY PALACE.

Co., and Mat Beasley

owner of the Red
Diamond, size each
other up.
She is so dazzled by a young bounder,
Leonard St. Aubyns, that the advances of
a more or less honest bookmaker, Tom Robin-
son, seem absurd ; and after she has de-
clined the bonnder’s offer of a flat, which
he explains away as a test of her character,
she enters into a secret marriage with him.
The revelation that Leonard married her
because that was the only way he could
secure her, and hopes to get rid of her
somehow when he is tired, comes in a shady
hostelry in France, where Tom Robin-
son and Fanny Le Clare drift in,
both obsessed with the idea that the
St. Aubyns marriage is as temporary as
their own—-an obsession also shared by
Leonard’s father, who arrives with a cheque-
book and an intention to end “the affair,”
until the traditional marriage-lines give him
the disconcerting truth. The information
that the haughty name of St. Aubyns is
merely an improvement of that of Stubbins,
avlio made his fortune out of cheap jams,
completes the disillusionment of Polly. Re-
jecting all offers of money in the spirit of
the best melodrama, she wanders penniless
out into a cold world, which ultimately
brings her to a house kept by a French-
woman who maintains a warm heart but no
stock of morals. There grandad, his son
having died, comes to claim the infant that
has been born to her; but, rather than sac-
rifice the child to influences which bred her
husband to be a cad and coward, she cheats
the pursy old man by giving the infant to
a childless Englishwoman who has be-
friended her and loves her baby. Subse-
quently a search for the child having nearly
driven her to madness, she decides to return
to France and wait in a hope that some day
Fate may return her boy to her. The epi-
logue switches the story back to the pro-
logue scene again ; there a brawl amongst
the customers brings the story to a well-
worked surprise conclusion, cheating that
large section of the audience which had
decided that the end was obvious.

Unpleasant a play must be in which in
one scene the dressing-room of a vaudeville
house is practically the ante-room to a
brothel, and in others the rooms are more
definitely part of such an establishment. Act
it is well constructed of its material, and
gives Pauline Frederick a chance of emo-
tional acting of a high order —emphasised
by admirable restraint upon occasion—which
produced tumults of applause in the climax
at the end of the third act, when, telling
him how she has cheated him of her child.
Polly makes a hysterical attack on the
retired jam-maker, St. Aubyns (alias
Stubbins). In that part the measure of
Mayne Lynton’s success is best indicated
by his ability to make the character despe-
rately serious in spite of the comedy face-
whiskers of the respectable burgher of the
period. June Elvidge, as Fanny Le Clare,
painted a good picture of the woman who
has no illusions: Rose Dione was Madame
Blanch, George Barraud played the caddish
younger St. Aubyns easily, and Charles Cole-
man gave a sincere touch to tbe sentimen-
tality of the plainly immoral bookmaker.
In a large cast most of the others were
merely background, but they were a very
efficient background; and the dresses of the
period were faithfully conceived.
At the end of next week “Little Jessie
James s disappearing bed will have out-
Jived its usefulness, and the gay box of
tricks will vanish from Melbourne’s New
1 nncess s. With it will go Dot Brunton, who
has made up her mind to see whether she
can repeat the London triumph she previ-
ously made with the help of admiring Diggers.

butes the atmosphere of a gay and ecstatic

The healthy Australian comedy that is the
most important product of Dad Bailey's
selection wakes howls of mirth from the
small boys and girls who plentifully mix
with , every night's audience at Melbourne
King's; and the older boys and girls enjoy
it equally.
“Snap” remains the principal ingredient
of the revue which chases away the shadows
of gloom from the New Palace in Melbourne.

A committee interested in a movement to
send off another candidate for European
voice-polish arranged a concert given in the
Melbourne Assembly Hall, with Miss Rita
Miller as the star—the young lady may be
remembered as having made an appearance
with the Melba Grand Opera Co. She was
best in the lighter numbers, and earned large
applause for her “Lo, Here the Gentle Lark”
and some Bantock songs; but “Ah Fors e
Lui” was too much for her. The quality of
purity and flexibility now and then evident
was spoiled by a singular ill-balance, indi-
cated by a poor control and an occasional
harshness. Still, the intelligence of the sing-
ing was marked and the faults are those
tuition can remove.

With Wee Georgie Wood gone, Melbourne
Tivoli programme has dropped back into
simple variety. “Traps,” an intelligent in-
fant. billed as “the World’s Youngest Jazz
Musician,” gives a remarkable performance
for one of his years; and the feminine part
of the audience, which calls the baby a little
darling, designates the wiry little lady of
the Daros partnership “a trick” as. at the
top of the ladder borne on the head of her
muscular partner, she jests about the possi-
bilities of breaking her neck. If it comes to
neck breaking, other artists could be much
better spared.

At Melbourne Bijou last Saturday George

(grandfather Wallace, one of the oldest of
Australian journalists, died only a couple of

These Americans get everywhere. One of
them, Mortimer Judd, actually pushes into
“Dante’s Inferno,” learns to abandon the cal-
lousness which has marked his struggle for
wealth and power, and becomes a normal
man who recognises that happiness for other
people and himself is the only legitimate pur-
suit. It is his dream, based upon the perusal
of a borrowed book, probably after a lobster
supper, and not the actual adventures of the
man who loved Beatrice, that forms the basis
of the “Dante’s Inferno” now showing at
Hoyt’s de Luxe in Melbourne. This Show-
man intends taking his landlord to see the
picture. Jack Bickford in “Waking Up the
Town” provides most of the rest of the bill.
At the Majestic Bert lialton’s jazz band sup-
plements “Into the Net,” which shows how
the New York police rope in the sort of
criminals who in Melbourne drive about in
motor-cars; and “Whistling Jim” provides
some light assistance.

Several Melbourne Art Shows: —
Carlisle Jackson, whose show at the Fine Art
Callery, Exhibition-street, includes 34 water-colors
and half a dozen oils, has a generally good outlook
and spacious conceptions, but he is inclined to con-
fuse his colors. The water of “Middle Harbor,
Sydney” (No. 10), is merely a splodge of blue ink
spilled into the centre of the picture and smudged
to varying thicknesses; and in such items as “Morn-
ing at Pontville” (No. 28) the work is unbalanced
by too much attention to some details and forget-
fulness of others. There are some pleasing canvases,
however; although one of the best of them, “Golden
Autumn” (No. 14), is spoiled by the W'ooden group-
ing of wooden cows in wooden attitudes. “Autumn
Morning on the River” (No. 40) is the best of
the oils.
The influence of her painter husband is strikingly
evident in a good deal of the work of Ethel Carries
(Mrs. Phillips Fox), shown at the New Gallery,
Elizabeth-street. There is a bold reaching out for
light and color in most of the pictures, and a
surprising dulness of tone in a few. An indifference
to. drawing is distressingly frequent. A sense of
life and movement is expressed in some of the
pictures, which are markedly impressionist, exactness
in drawdng being deliberately omitted. For the
light treatment in them, some of the elaborate
displays of still life are alluring; but the most
satisfaction is found in the least ambitious.
John Hennessy appears to have thrown the con-
tents of his studio bodily into the Upper Athenseum
Hall, including a number of still-life and other
studies which, whilst they might be useful to his
pupils for copying purposes, should have no place
in an art show. The canvases go back to 1894;
but amidst the jumble, the really good self-portrait
of the artist, a recent work, is the best in the show.
Some of the early canvases are, however, very appeal
ing, including “Welcome News” (1899) and “Willing
Hands” (1902). The technique of the artist has
vastly improved; but most of the work is merely
solidly good and lacks inspiration.
The great showman’s truth that anything
is. new enough if it is old enough
has inspired a turn now having its first-in-
twentieth-century-Australia run at Adelaide
Majestic. The little co. of five veterans does
its best to make a semi-circle on the stage
in the old fashion. George Campbell, once
of the Moore and Burgess minstrels, is an
oldtime chairman with hammer, tankard and
cigar. Arthur Slater, the whistling man,
has hardly altered at all. Jake Friedman
obliges with his one-man opera, and helps the
others with the old-man business. The ladies
sing marvellously, considering all things.
They are Florence Hinton and Lily Bur-
nand, to whom the years have been wonder-
fully kind. The audience .welcomes the old
favorites heartily, and joins in “Little Annie
Rooney” and other echoes from the past.
The Boucicault season at the Royal is said
to have broken all records for any Australian
city: Adelaide always had a warm welcome
for high-class work. “Tanqueray” gave Irene
Vanbrugh her chance, and after its tragic
atmosphere “Aren’t We All?” closed the sea-
son with a frivolous shrug. Here again.
Boucicault made the action revolve round
his own comparatively small character, by an
infinity of elaborate touches. His acting
seems all one great tour de force, and the
audiences love every bit of it. Guy Bates
Post, with a strong co., is just on the door-
step.
Two Adelaide shows :
The Bloxam exhibition at the Society of Arts is
remarkable for the young man’s versatility. He has
the customary Port Elliott seascapes and bits from
Sydney Harbor and the Hawkesbury. He has also
a particularly “faithful” style of reproducing sheds,
claypits and the like; also his pen-drawings attract.
In spite of which he has suddenly broken out as one
of the very few good portrait-painters in Adelaide.
The Goodehild show at Preece’s Gallery is necessarily
more monotonous. He denies himself almost en-
tirely the use of color. But in drawing or etching,
whether of the severe outline or the obscure, his
lines are sound.

age the Camilla Urso concert party for Sam
Lazar, lessee of the old Sydney Royal. Then
.lack Bennett, who imported Ristori and
others, grabbed him to manage the concerts
at the Sydney School of Arts; and he began
to warn off deadheads at the Royal as man-
ager for Arthur Garner when Garner opened
up with his comedy co. in ISBO, with
“Friends,” George Titheradge playing the
lead. He crossed over to J. C. Williamson
when the big man called, and thence until
1915, with frequent returns in a relieving
capacity, he occupied the manager’s cubby-
house in various J.C.W.’s city theatres.
Down-and-out mummers and sundry Hebrew
charitable organisations benefited largely
from his open pocket. A rare storyteller,
“Goody” gained firsthand material for his
tales in many excursions with rod and line
along the coast. He was 80 at the end.
“Charlik” discusses voices:—
The visit of the Sistine singers has again raised
the question as to what constitutes a tenor voice.
There are so many kinds. The one I wish to speak
about is the tenore leggiero, or tenore contraltino,
which is the class Paganelli’s belongs to. It is a
most useful voice, and in the concerted music, which
forms the most worth-while feature of the programme,
is all-important. Yet it is not “tenor” as we. with
memories of Phil Newbury and one or two others,
understand it. It would be as absurd for these
singers to attempt “Caro Mio Ben,” as written, as
it would be for Paganelli to sing “Lend Me Your
Aid.” The voices are entirely different, and yet
they are both called tenor. The nearest parall"l
to the Paganelli class of voice is the counter-tenor
or male alto of cathedral and church choirs —-abso-
lutely indispensable, but rarely effective in solo
work. There have been exceptions, of course. Dr.
W. A. Barrett, co-editor with Sir John Stainer of
“A Dictionary of Musical Terms”—a standard work—-
was an alto in St. Paul's Cathedral when I was a
lad there. His voice had the sympathetic liquid
quality of the low tones of a flute, and Joseph Plant,
master of the boys and alto in Canterbury Cathedral,
who was an elderly man when I joined, sang “O •
Rest in the Lord” as I have never heard it sung
by any contralto before or since. It was for this
class of voice that the florid music so beloved b\
Rossini, Bellini and Donizetti was composed, and
singers like Paganelli revel in it. But it is quality
not compass that matters; therein lies all the
dinerence.
“Lysander”: Allan Wilkie, who has
acquired the 0.8. E., is the first actor to be
“honored” in Australia for being an actor,
the knighthoods of Tallis and Fuller not
counting as rewards for eminence in Art.
For this reason the gaud will please Wilkie,
who sometimes feels that he has not been
given a fair spin in his efforts to introduce
Shakspeare to Australians. A small but dif-
fuse company of critics persists in attack-
ing him each time his cycle of seasons brings
him within vitriol-range. He and his com-
pany are not great Shakspeareans—lie could
not produce Shakspeare and live if lie had to
pay great exponents—but he is at least a
good trier, and a game pioneer on a track
which is full of rough places and has ban-
ditti sniping from safe cover.
A note from Kenneth Duffield:—
In The Bulletin's kind criticism of the first
production in Australia of my musical revue “Snap”
one inaccuracy occurred at the end, and as it
reflects somewhat on my friend Howett Worster, whose
energy and artistry were undoubtedly responsible for
any success the revue achieved, 1 want you to be
good enough to put it right. Your report ran:
“Howett Worster clean forgot in his speech to men-
tion the composer of the music, Kenneth Duffield,
who was in a box.” Mr. Wdrster made the most
kindly references to me and to my music, and I
was forced to endure the ordeal of a spot lime
thrown on to the box whilst I made a suitable reply.
One can quite understand any reporter not getting
Mr. Worster’s reference to me, as the house was very
happy and excited and there was a great deal of
noise.
“C.K.”: My par. about the “Kreutzer”
sonata (B. 28/5/’25) would have been nearer
the mark if I had stated that the dedication
remains a mystery. Bridgetower, the com-
missioner of the work, described by an
accepted authority (Grove) as a bombastic
half-caste, claimed it, and gave a quarrel as
the cause for its transference to Kreutzer.
Although “en arnico” occurs in the phraseo-
logy of the dedication, there is no other
evidence that Beethoven and Kreutzer were
friends. Anyway, the work remains, so the
dedication does not matter much.
“F.N.W.”: Aspiring vocalists and instru-
mentalists who read press statistics concern-
ing the remuneration of such artists as Galli-
Curci and Kreisler should remember the re-
verse side of the medal. I once inflicted an
extra .turn on the audience in a well-known
London ’all. Afterwards I asked the manager
an intimate question about money. “Money !
Money for an extra turn!” he roared.
“Dammit, my boy, haven’t you seen the show
for nothing?” As for fiddlers, in the window
of a dingy house at the back of the Old
Ivent-road (London). I recently saw this
cryptic notice: “Violin Lesson and Cup of
Tea, 9d.”
“Dalba” : The audience had just breathed
again after the soul-stirring encore of the
great violinist. A homely-looking soul in
the vicinity broke the spell with: “As I
was saying, dear, before he began that
pretty piece, you can’t expect to get real
clear jelly unless you strain through a
flannel bag.”
“Caesar’s Ghost” : The harp which Torzillo
now plays in his vaudeville engagement with
George Castles was among the salvage re-
trieved by the A.I.F. from the war wreck.
A member of Torzillo’s unit discovered it in
France, and the man with the harmonious
fingers smote the strings to such purpose
in the hearing of High Authority that he
was not allowed to return to plain soldiering.
For some time the harp and Torzillo pro-
vided the only music in Amiens Cathedral,
the organ being out of action. A French
claim to the ownership of the instrument was
settled for 3000 francs, and Torzillo took
it with him on Paris leave. In a few hours
he could have sold it again for 4000 francs.
Torzillo reckons his Gallic harp far superior
to the one he was permitted to take away
with him from Australia. Fritz got that
one in the Spring of 1918.
“Nitric”: The good Australians who are
filming a story adapted from Mrs. Forrest’s
novel “Wild Moth” are doing the job in the
beautiful Rosevale valley, near Harrisvillo
(Q.). A few miles distant is the Main
Range, whose peaks stretch across the sky-

Downs, stands out as a landmark, and the
Sleeping Assyrian—so called because the
features of an Oriental are plainly discern-
ible on this towering spur—is not far away.
Arthur Taucliert, of “Sentimental Bloke”
celebrity, is one of the actors, and after
scouring the countryside for a suitable child
to play the part of Dell, Clumvel, the direc-
tor, found the type he wanted in Rosevale
itself. It is planned to have the picture
ready for screening in August, during Bris-
bane's exhibition week.
“Kilmeadon” : While examining a station
book in the Ilillston (N.S.W.) district to
verify the original cost of some improvement,
I came across a queer entry made in the
early ’nineties: “200 acres of ringbarking at
9d. per acre in No. 4 paddock, by members
of a stranded dramatic company.” “What
a tour that was, me lady!” said Horatio
Jb eatherstonhaugh, the heavy, to the co.'s new
recruit. “If I made one hit, if you foller
me, I made hundreds.”
“E.”: Judith Anderson has realised her
ambition of becoming a Beiasco star. Go-
ing to America eight years ago, she joined,
a stock company, and later played with
William Gillette in . “Dear Brutus,” with
Arnold Daley in “On the Stairs,” and with
Frank Keenan in “Peter Weston” and “The
Crooked Square.” But the Australian girl
was always waiting for the Beiasco call, and
at last it came. ,Nne has been appearing in
a Broadway theatre as leading woman in
"The Dove,” a melodrama, by Pauline
Frederick’s second husband, Willard Mack.
“Coot”: Knowles did not appear \in
“Othello” at the opening of the old Queen-
street Theatre, Melbourne, as stated by
“Cmsar’s Ghost” (B. 14/5/’25) ; he died on
June 19, 1844, and the theatre was not built
until 1845. The first performance—a bene-
fit to .lolin Davies—really took place on
April 21, 1545, Francis Nesbitt and Mrs.
Knowles figuring in “The Bear Hunters, or
The Fatal Ravine,” and “Black-eyed Susan.”
Two months later Mr. and Mrs. George
Coppin made their advent in “The Lady of
Lyons” and two farces. On July 8 Coppin
produced “The School for Scandal,” and, a
week later, “Macbeth”—its first representa-
tion on the boards in Melbourne.
“Flicker”: “The Thief of Bagdad” re-
cently paid a visit to the pitcher theatre in
our S. Aus. suburb, and the youth of the
locality received it with joy. The night 1
attended the show there was a band of the
neighborhood’s curses in the hall. As the
Mongol prince, majestic in silks and jewels,
was turned down by the lovely princess and
stalked from the court with baffled passion
in his face and threats of vengeance on his
lips, a clear boyish voice broke the silence
with “No vegetables to-day, John —shut the
gate!”
“SNEEZED LYNNE.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“In the year ’93,” remarked Haresfoot to me,
“I was with a 'fit-up’ when we struck Bungaree.
As the ghost hadn't walked for ten days—well, you
see
That amongst us there wasn’t much tin.
We’d a terrible bout with a perishing drought,
So the council that sat to contrive a way out
Agreed that the best card to play when in doubt
Was to put on a night of ‘East Lynne.’
“Miss Siddonia Kean undertook Madame Vine,
Julius Day was Carlyle with his dignified mien,
Little Wiilie entrusted to Nellie McQueen,
Roue Levison fell to my lot;
All the posts were well billed, so the Town Hall was
filled,
But the great sobful scene in the last act was killed,
For red pepper some vandal had ruthlessly spilled
In the region of Wee Willie’s cot.
“There he tossed ill at ease; then he gave a loud
sneeze
In Madame Vine’s face, as she wept on her knees,
Which just lifted her wig like a leaf on the breeze,
So the tragic became the absurd.
All the crowd thought it prime, just a real panto-
mime,
Though poor Siddie declared ’twas a dastardly crime.
To the ridiculous from the sublime
In a moment we shot, ’pon my word.
“From the ‘prompt’ Monty Blue made a rush into
view,
Stretched his mouth to appeal, but just bellowed
‘atchoo’ ;
Then my nose caught a whiff at the exit in ‘two,’
S>, 1 added my ‘woof’ to the din.
We’d to lower f lic rag without speaking the tag ;
But the sneeze-saddened spirits revived from their
sag
When the Guv’nor shared the contents of the bag
We’d got from our show of ‘Sneezed Lynne.’ ”

Something
Different
Dozens of brands are being sold in this country. In blend
they differ slightly.
In CAVANDER’S “ARMY CLUB’’ CIGARETTES smokers
have something different, something better, something for
which they have unconsciously waited.
CAVANDER’S “ARMY CLUB” are made from the best
Virginia crops blended in the best possible way. Their
size is sufficient to allow of a full and long appreciation
of the delightful tobacco.
Wrapped in pure ribbed rice paper, the name water marked

POLISHING
WAX
Johnson’s Polishing Wax imparts a hard, dry, velvety
finish which is impervious to water, dust, scratches,
heel-marks, finger prints, etc. It cleans, polishes, pre-
serves and protects —all in one operation.
JOHNSON’S LIQUID WAX is the ideal furniture polish.
It imparts a hard, dry, glass-like lustre which will not
gather dust and lint, or show finger prints. Johnson’s
Liquid Wax takes all the drudgery from dusting. It
adds years to the life and beauty of varnish.
YOUR LINOLEUM will last longer—look better and clean easier
if polished occasionally with Johnson’s Paste or Liquid Wax.

Dear Sirs, _
We are returning to you one Pioneer Double Leather licit,
each loin, and JJ,Mn. wide, which toe hare no further use for,
as ice hare dismantled our Electric Light Plant and connected
up with the Municipal Council Supply.
These were purchased, from you about 25 years ago, and
arc still in very good condition after all these years of service.
They have proved to be a very good investment to us, for apart
from their long and efficient service, they arc returning to us
more than we originally paid for them.

E.C.: “Damaged Goods” not very original;
some picturesque effects almost saved it.... 8.8.:
“McPherson’s” is too wildly improbable. .. .C.E.F.:
The verse won’t do; and your pommy is an early
m0de1.... J.C.8.: You spread it out too thin; in
about half the space it might be acceptable.... M.
Gregory: No grip in your narrative.... Dunbar: The
prose is spoiled by a too-ponderous manner. The
verse is thin and halting... .J.0.M.: “Flapper” had
some hope till the last verse. Then the poor girl
crashed beyond repair.... Gringo: It creaks at every
joint—and it seems nearly all joints.... Muriel:
Unsuitable. .. .F.G.T.: Clean off our beat. And dull
stuff, anyway.... Apemantus: No yarn there....
A.M. B.; The story is thin and weak and the verse
is in an old rut.... Ripponlea: There is rare philo-
sophy in your “Poem in a Minor Key”:—
To live, that is life. To die. that is death.
To rest, that is good ; to sleep, that is well.
To suffer, that is pain. To breathe, that is breath.
To starve, that is hunger. To thirst, that is Hell.
How good we all ought to be!
Th’ ways of dying are infinite.
We should, indeed, be noble and true; for w»
Might drop down dead any minute.
Come, let us mope and be morbid ;
Live i’ a world of sobs, sorrows and sighs;
Then if anything cheerful should happen,
It will come as a pleasant surprise.
A beautiful thought strikes me often ;
That life couldn’t be much worse.
And there’s beautiful lace i’ each coffin,
And beautiful flowers i’ each hearse.
. ...J.J.11.: No new thought in it.... J. S. Harte:
Promise in it; but the end slumps badly... . A/c
Sales: Why waste very fair work on such unrelieved
and purposeless horror ?... .Wawh: “Peerage” misses
its chances... .Farnham: Nothing there to make any-
body listen S.F.C.: Too much preliminary song
and dance about “Non Possumus.” And the yarn
is an old one into the bargain. .. .Vulangi: Accept-
able ; but it will have to be pruned pretty hard
Castlebar; Rather commonplace... .E.C.: “Insistent
Lover” must be better done to get through....
T.G.K.: Night of Allah lacks the punch to get in
W.H.S.: Your recoi'd of the Homeric struggle of Bill
Jackson won’t face the Parnassus grade M.E.A.:
Your brew is too sentimental. .. . J.H.: “The Reason”
is 90 p.c. incoherent and 10 p.e. dull. Try writing
about something you have known or felt....A.J.
(Sydney) : “Care” is too dull and clumsy in blade
to ever slash a way into print. The Harbor song
is passable with some omissions... .W.H.L.: Evi-
dently that man will have to brand his jokes in
future. .. .M.G. : We couldn’t do without it: —
A lonely old swagman lay dying
Away out in the wild mulga scrub,
While beside him his collie was crying,
Though it wasn’t for want of its grub.
' The old man cried aloud for some water,
But his dog didn’t quite understand
Till he reached for the old battered billy,
Which he’ held in a worn, wasted hand.
Then Joe rushed away to the river,
With the billy grasped firm in his teeth ;
And on the bridge of the river stood gazing
At two men who were fishing beneath.
He guided both back to his master,
Whose life they were in time just to save;
An 1 oft-times an old man’s been seen crying
On his faithful old collie-dog’s grave.
....Winnie: A small idea; but there is no music in
your handling of it... .D. 8.0.: Poor stuff... . J.S.D.;
An uninteresting catalogue... .ML S. Dalby: Sorry,
but we can’t find a single good quality in them....
R.F.C.; Uninspiring commonplace. .. .Bis: You plough
in a very old furrow... -U. (M.L.) : Political farce
counted out. .. . R. 8.; Not suitable. .. .\V .D.T.:
Character sketch graphic, but story too slight....
J.C.C.: Interest too diffused and construction arti-
ficial C.E.S.: You must be satisfied with the
bunch of roses from the beautiful young girl....
H.S.K.: Lesson in philandering no good. .. . J.M.8.:
You’ve missed that ’bus by a good fortnigat. .. .
Box 194: It doesn’t run smoothly enough. But
it’s a" good subject you’ve got on to.... Marian
Russell: Please send address Echo: “Ammonyer”
is too venerable a quip; the other is all right....
Oora: “The Ride” is uneven. See if you can’t cut
out the prosy tags...-N.E.R.: “The Tide” isn’t
well enough done for that sort of thing....K. L.
Trent: There are corns on its feet through climbing
editorial stairs. .. . J.J.H.: Rather clumsily built. .. .
J D.McD.: Good for Ryan !
EARLY MORN.
Missus Ryan started crying when she thought her
twins was dead.
Still, Mick Ryan still’d ’er crying as lie turned to her
and said: .
“No they ’aven’t chuck’d a seven, they’re in bed
and not in Heaven,
So stop them sobs and cut out bawlin’. Isn’t that
the milkman callin’ ?”
....Gilbert G.: Your “Morning” nearly broke into
print; and it takes a pretty good morning to do
that in 1925... .R.W.T.: Here and there eye seem to
catch sight of a pretty fancy ; and then it is gone,
and the whole thing looks meaningless. .. .G.G,;
Another of those Gap tragedies, we presume....
R.H.R.: The sun has set on “When Daylight Dies.”
. ... F.W.: “Unheeded.” AY ell, it almost asked to be.
. ...T.G.A.; Your meanderings are pleasant, but
offer only length without depth.-.. .Ky West: “Grave
was a very near thing. The others read as
though they were trying to be clever... .E.K.R.:
“Cold Eyes” are too fish-1ike.... V.J.P.: Your
violin hasn’t much to say yet, and Occasionally
falls out of tune. But keep on trying... .K.H.T..:
“Fairy Tale” doesn’t bring in the atmospheie, the
others have merit, and the basket wins by a bai 1
nose... .T.W.8.: “The Song of the Harvester” comes
a terrible crash in the verse:—
I am the child of unrest,
Of the limitless marching of man;
I bring him life, work and rest,
1 bring flour and bran.
Tartuff: Not an ounce of sincerity to the ten
of it N.D.R.: You have misread the critic
Moray: Comb out your brains. Your arguments
pour out in a hopeless tangle.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
W.C.: You are consistent, at any rate. A child
like that could only have had such parents. .. .
11.W.T.: It doesn’t improve.. . .J.M.: Vou went off
the boil before you had finished... .A.S.: Subject
calls for a butterfly touch ; yours suggests the hoof
of a mastodon.... N.C.: Faint pencil wouldn t re-
produce even if the art was possible, which it isnt.
A.M.: Painfully orthodox G.E.H.: A square
of paper scratched like a barnyard f100r... .P.L.H..
It knew its own way into the basket S.lv.: You
want to know “its faults —if any.” It has only one.
It is all wrong.... A.B. and A.L.P.: Chaiacteiless
portraits. ..-H.R.M.; Lacks vim. .. .G.C.S.: Has
promise; keep on.

Hypol is a friend indeed to the precious I
little folk. It chases away gloom and anxiety,
by restoring sick Children to the bloom of health.
For racking Coughs and Colds, the prevention of
Rickets, or for keeping up the strength of Children
who are growing rapidly, there is nothing so reliable
and sustaining as
Delicate Children should be given Hypol during the wintet
jnonths. It will build up resistance to illness and disease,
and improve their condition generally.
There can be no failure with HYPOL. Try a Bottle

“Simon”: Time we found some use for
the countless tons of waste and wasted rubber
represented in worn motor-tyres. In America
they grind them up and convert them into
compo, waistbelts, golosh-bottoms, “rubber”
mats, etc. And much of this they ship to
people like us who are too indolent to get
ideas for themselves.
* * * *
“Jaycee”: Confiscated opium to the value
of at least £l5OO was solemnly destroyed the
other day at Sydney in the presence of Cus-
toms officials. I suppose the law demands
it, but it seems a senseless and wanton waste
of a valuable drug which could be converted
to a beneficial purpose by any reputable firm
of manufacturing chemists.
* * * *
“Askeaton”: Our butter goes far and wide
these days. During the past few months I
personally have put the stencil-mark on
butter consigned to Cape Town, Durban, Port
Said, Colombo, Singapore, Kobe, Hong
Kong, Shanghai, Antwerp and Dunkirk.
Since the introduction, about 12 months ago,
of the “Kangaroo” trade-mark (for “choicest
export” only), Australian butter has
established itself more firmly on the London
market, too. During the three months end-
ing March 31 Australia shipped to London
982,760 boxes, including choicest, first and
second grade, as well as pastry. But the
’roo travels only in the choicest company.
“Yarrum”: Surprising what kiddies make
at our schools nowadays. I visited a school
in the Wellington (N.S.W.) district re-
cently, and found all the boys using home-
made cricket-bats. They were varnished and
polished in a high degree, and were the best
drivers ever I handled. Teacher told me
the lads had sent to Sydney for a couple of
bats, at £2 each, and they lasted only a week
or two. Then, as they hadn’t money to burn,
and as there were plenty of willows in the
creek, and lots of split canes to be had, they
started making for themselves. In some cases
they used handles of old bats, and beauti-
fully dovetailed them into the strong blades.
One I saw might easily be mistaken for a
Wisden.
* * * *
“Matt” : I quite believe the story about the
two stowaways from Sydney who escaped de-
tection until the Bay liner was within four days
of England. At off times during the year a
steamer of this line, with accommodation for
about 750 passengers, often fails to have 250
aboard for London. The result is that there
is any amount of room for stowaways, and
as the stewards very rarely have a passenger-
list they don’t know who’s who till the ship
has well cleared the Australian coast. I was
a passenger on a Bay liner when two dis-
appointed Pommies came aboard at Mel-
bourne and proceeded to make themselves
comfortable. They might have evaded detec-
tion till the boat had left Australia astern
had not the third steward, who had received
a torrent of abuse from the pair for point-
ing out that smoking was forbidden in the
social hall, asked to see their tickets. The
Fremantle police took charge of them.
* * * *
“Sim”: At Botobolar, 20 miles from
Mudgee (N.S.W.), they don't bother much
about coin. Recently I saw the big van from
town make its periodical visit. Presently
from over the creek came a man with a
green cowhide on his back; he handed his
burden to the man at the tailboard in ex-
change for a pillow-slip of assorted groceries.
Then Mrs. Q. arrived and swapped a bucket
of eggs for an armful of shiny-bottomed tins
and a crockery teapot. Next old O’B. made
his appearance with a side of bacon which
was exchanged for about its equivalent in
weight of salt salmon, it being Lent. The
local bee-burglar drove up with two petrol-
tins of rich bush honey. He took it out in
a cross-cut saw and a 6oz. bottle of eucalyp-
tus to anoint himself with so that he wouldn’t
be stung while robbing the nests. A lot of
business was done that afternoon, but not
a bean passed.
“Harold Hardupp”: Illicit crayfishing is
viewed with such an entire absence of dis-
approbation on the Tasmanian east coast that
a fisherman who is also a J.P. cheerfully
admitted, before a committee of inquiry, that
he used the forbidden pots himself. Some
indication of the general feeling was given
recently when the confiscated craft of a
man caught smuggling was put up for sale.
Nobody bid against the ex-owner, and he
bought his property back again for a hundred
pounds—the equivalent of a substantial fine.
* * * *
“Tabac” on a nice point of law:—
If John Doe becomes the tenant Qf Richard Roe
and during the tenancy Richard transfers his interest
to a third party, in what position is John to the
new man? John declares that the new man has
nothing to do with him, and he will continue in
possession of the rented premises after his tenancy
has expired until someone turns him out—someone
who is entitled to do so. So John stays on. The
new man declares that as transferee of Richard’s
interest he stands in his boots and has all the rights
of a landlord that Richard had. Among these rights
in N. S. Wales are such as are given him under
the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1899, which pro-
vides that, when the term or interest of the tenant
lias either expired by effluxion of time or has been
determined by notice to quit or demand of possession
and nevertheless the tenant stays on and refuses to
go, the landlord may apply to the Court of Petty
Sessions, and, on "the production of necessary proof,
get an order to put him in possession, even, if
necessary, with physical force. That’s what the
landlord can do, and it is what the new man claimed
he had a right to do, as he was now de facto the
landlord of the premises. But the P.M. before whom
the case was brought shook his head and in
effect said “Go away—the only landlord I know of
is Mr. Richard Roe; he was the man who created
the tenancy and in whose bosom is lodged such rights
as the law gives him. As to the other gentleman,
I don’t know him, I don’t see him, and I have no
jurisdiction in the claim he makes.” And so also
the Full Court determined, and their Honors washed
their hands of the matter in the pure waters of
Sloane v. Hayes, which laid down that the proceedings
under this Act must be between the parties actually
creating the tenancy. As the transferee was not
one of those parties he was out of court. So John
Doe sits tight and asks who’s going to shift him.

When the Maori is stirred to his inner-
most being, poetry usually wells up. His
dirges over Mr. Massey were very impres-
sive. In one of them the mourners charged
Massey’s spirit to carry their love to Seddon.
“Sucre” : Maoriland is not the only coun-
try that can boast of a mayoral parson.
Father Minmah, of Bundaberg (Q.), cried
“Order!” at many council meetings there in
years back. Gayndali (Q.) had another
clerical councillor. He met his death in flood
waters of the Burnett.
Passed over at Mosman, Sydney, George
P. Carter, prominent in accountancy and
formerly a lecturer in the Faculty of
Economics at Sydney University. He came
from the Cold Land in 1908 to keep ledgers
for Great Cobar. When that concern closed
down about 10 years ago, he entered David
Fell’s and stayed there till his death.
The new secretary of .the S.A. Commercial
Travellers and Warehousemen’s Association
(including a big social club on North-
terrace) is to be C. A. M. West, an all-round
hustler of 35, who .has been secretary of
Adelaide Stock Exchange, manager of inter-
state lacrosse teams, and notably manager
of the S.A. rowing crew in various States,
and of the same crew in Paris when it repre-
sented Australia in the Olympic sports.
Alfred Ernest Smith, chief mechanical
engineer for Vic. Railways, who has just
completed his sixth year of office, drew his
first pay in the recently demolished Williams-
town loco.-sheds in 1883, and then steadily
scrambled higher and higher in the service.
He is a versatile citizen; besides being a
high railway engineering authority, he is an
astronomer who constructed his own tele-
scope ; his water-color work is not by any
means amateurish; and he dabbles in sculp-
ture and modelling.
R. J. Dumas, of the Mount Barker (S.A.)
Courier family, goes to the Water Supply
Department of Westralia. With a whole
string of initials after his name from Adel-
aide Uni. and School of Mines, he has for
some years been in charge of drainage works
in S.A.’s south-east, and latterly on the big
locking scheme of the Murray. He was an
applicant recently for the post of hydraulic
engineer; but the man at a distance mostly
looks biggest, so S.A. imported Bellamy from
the Speck, and exports Dumas to the West.
They are more frank about it in some parts
of' the Empire. Ad. from the “situations
vacant” column of the East African Stand-
ard (Kenya) :
Public Executioner.—Applications, which should
give particulars of qualifications, for the above posi-
tion, are invited. Applications, which will be treated
in confidence, should be addressed to the Commissioner
of Prisons, P.O. Box 60, Nairobi.
One wonders what “qualifications” short of
actual experience in the grisly calling would
carry weight.
“Borom” : The real danger from domestic
bath-heaters (B. 28/5/’25) is not escaping
gas-fumes, but that faulty combustion may
result in the formation and release of carbon
monoxide. This gas, of which only 5 per
cent, in the air is sufficient to cause death,
is produced from the coal-gas used in these
contrivances; and although most of the new
types of heaters are perfectly safe in this
respect, many of the old ones are not. Any-
body who has in the house a heater dating
further back than about 1910 should regard
it with the deepest suspicion.
Tom O’Halloran, K.C., who acts as chair-
man of Adelaide Football League during the
visit of A. J. McLachlan to England, issued
a kind of manifesto on taking over the job:
“There is often a tendency to try a new man
in charge, and see whether he is soft or
hard.” And he forthwith proved which kind
he was by disqualifying a West Torrens
player, convicted of striking the umpire after
a match, for three whole seasons. O’Hal-
loran completed a good “double” the same
day by acting as spokesman for the Law
Society of South Aus. before a Parliamentary
Commission.
The story of a Lost Gaud
When the late Capt. Samuel Mitchell, of H.M.S.
Harrier, won his V.C. in 1864, for gallantry in
the squabble with the Maoris at Gate Pah, Tauranga,
he stowed it away in his sea-chest. This was left
with friends in Sydney, where Governor Young had
presented the medal to him. From Maoriland, where
he settled after his discharge, he wrote asking that
the chest should be forwarded; but the friends and
his belongings had disappeared. Exhaustive police
inquiries produced no result. Not a word further
was heard till 1909, when a cable message saying
that the Cross had been sold at Messrs. Glendining’s
Galleries, London, for £6O, appeared in M.L.
papers. The owner was dead, but relatives got on
the trail; and, though to date the medal has not
been recovered, the collector who made the pur-
chase in 1909 was recently located.
“Alastor” : J. A. Macartney, a well-known
station-owner in Nor’-West Queensland and
the Northern Territory, was probably Aus-
tralia’s champion endurance rider. Winton
to Waverley was covered by him in six days
—GOO miles. He travelled generally in a red
buckboard, with an equipment that in-
cluded a water-tank, and residents of the
Nor’-West gloried in his record overland trips.
He owned Manuka, Bladensbury and Diaman-
tina stations. Once he met the great
rider Skuthorpe at Charlevillc. when both
were on their way to Blackall to take up
land. A race ensued, and Skuthorpe just
heat Macartney. Skuthorpe got Urbana,
since called Brighton Downs, and Macartney
secured Diamantina Gates, so called because
it is situated on a reach of the Diamantina
River narrowed in between two high ridges.
At the end of a friendly law-suit in Mel-
bourne Justice McArthur decided that Simon
Staughton, posthumous son of Samuel
Staughton the younger, is entitled to the
possession of Eynesbury station, Werribee
(Vic.). Simon came of age in July last
year, and is married. His grandfather, S.T.,
was member for West Bourke in the Vic.
Assembly from 1880 till 1901. He caught
cold in the newly-equipped temporary State
House at the Exhibition and died. A warm
welcome was given to his fine-looking and
gallant son. Captain Sam, D. 5.0., who
gained the seat; and fellow-members were
just beginning to know him well when the
Black Angel claimed him. He left an estate
worth £108,362. The posthumous son,
Simon, who now comes into possession, was
born two months after his dad’s death. He
is to pay £lOOO a year to trustees for his
mother in compliance with a provision of
the will.

IT’S time to leave the shanty.
Though love and grog are sweet,
Near time to raise the chanty;
It’s morning in the street.
But we’ll be back, Ma Dooley,
To make the lasses gay
And love them well and truly
With all a sailor’s pay.
Then ho for the green highway!
(Break out the old mud-hook!)
The same foam-splattered highway
That bore brave Captain Cook.
New heavens shall lift above us,
New headlands rise to view;
And still the league before 11s
And the white wake be new.
Hull down from Hobart jetty,
Well in the Tasman seas.
We hunt for spermacetti,
We search for ambergris;
With lee-rail dipping under.
A white bone in her teeth.
Above a kindly thunder
And snorings loud beneath.
For this men call seafaring
(There’s powder in the hold).
This toil and profit sharing.
We need 110 store of gold.
Senspray on the horizon
Rises to stooping clouds;
The chill grey wind it flies on
Is clammy 011 the shrouds.
Here, in tumultuous vastness.
The unshod coursers roam
From fastness unto fastness
To pastures fenced with foam.
Then ho for the South Island.
Along the old green way!
With brown peak and white highland
Above each sound and bay.
The white plains of the ocean,
The bell-mouth of the sky.
The reeling drunken motion.
With long leagues lapping by.
They charm like tales of treasure
Of which old pirates tell;
They teach the eye to measure
The rolling parallel.
We moor to whales we slaughter;
We harbor as we go.
And load in bloody water.
Onr song the glad “Blow-oh!
Oh. grimly strains the rower!
The keen crew's now afloat.
And grimly stands each thrower
With silence in his boat.
Deep inlets wait the charting
On West Otago's shore.
With streams of water starting
From every wooded pore;
Though on the bonldered benches
The combers' thunder falls.
The high-walled fiord reaches
To where the kea calls.
We'll reef and tack and sail her
From Milford to Foveaux;
We'll steer the smutty whaler
Wherever ship may go.
JTalf-mast. the blood and blubber
Would make a landsman faint:
But soon we'll sand and .scrub her
Clean of her devil's paint.
We're past the Nuggets, spreading
Full sail to failing wind.
For Chasland’s we are heading.
There where the neck is thinned
Till water leaps to water
And hides the sand between.
’Twas there that Chasland brought her
Unto her last careen.
TTo. ho for ships that founder!
Few care how thev may go;
Yet none are sleeping sounder
Than those well berthed below.
Hell holds the lion-hearted:
And so we'll comb the Pit,
If there arc seas uncharted,
And steal a crew from it.
Year in year out we dai’c it.
The death that lurks beneath.
Year in year out we share it.
Hard-bitten twixt our teeth.
The gain that comes from whaling
From blubber and balleen —
Rich kills and unavailing.
That sink and rise unseen.
The ship has had her season,
So what of me and you?
She knows with right good reason
The old-time rendezvous.
The scuttle-butts are drying,
There's water at the pa
And wood and stores are lying
At Kororareka.
The whaler and the trader
Shall mingle song and mirth
With Susan —we who made her
And she who knows our worth.
Kind soul, she fills the measure
In her endearing way—
Dear lady, born to pleasure—
For such all sailors pray.
Now round the Horn we’re sailing.
Upon the the futtock-shrouds
Damnation due to whaling
We’ll loose in sleety clouds;
With every backstay humming,
The logship swiftly towed
And all her reef-points drumming,
We keep the Old Green Road!

T was over coffee and liqueurs m the
lounge at Menzies’. The warehouse
of one of our quartette had been

and the tightening up of the Law. It was
generally agreed that crime had increased at
an alarming rate since the war, and one
enthusiastic reformer suggested that we
should adopt the French method of dealing
with suspects. ‘‘Once a man is under
arrest,” he urged, ‘‘the onus should be on
him to prove his innocence. This ‘benefit
of the doubt’ business is overdone.”
One of our company, Leo Clarke, remained
silent until directly appealed to by the
“burgled” merchant. He was known to us
as a quiet citizen of sound views, but since
his return from France he usually kept his
views to himself. "It’s a matter,” he said,
"on which my opinions are in a state of
flux.”
The burgled one snorted. “Wait,” he said,
“till some swine breaks into your house.”
“I have a tale to tell,” was the answer.
“Last month I served as a juryman.
Although sure that one ofl the men on trial
was guilty, on the evidence, of stealing, I
stood out for his acquittal and got it.”
“You were false to your oath,” growled
the latest victim of the housebreaking mania.
“Perhaps so, but listen to my story and
then tell me if any of you would have acted
differently.”
We listened; and this was the story we
got.
* * # *
You know, I went to France as a private,
but very soon they made a sergeant of me,
and I became responsible for the soldiering'
of an extraordinary little squad. A medical
student, two youths from an ecclesiastical col-
lege, a half-baked barrister, two shearers
from the Murray, some decent, every-day
mechanics, and one little outsider known to
the company as “the Richmond Rat.” He
was grotesquely undersized. How he ever got
through was a mystery. About twenty years
of age, he had an elfish face that suggested
fifty years of iniquity in the worst of slum
areas. He was the most ingenious thief in
the regiment, and had been more than once
unmercifully trounced by his mates. On
one occasion, caught in the act, he had been
thrown out of his quarters, and a fortnight's
hospital—with concussion—resulted. He
also knew every old trick for avoiding dis-
tasteful duties, and invented a lot of new
ones. But he had two outstanding virtues.
He was invariably cheerful, and, onee his
bluff was called, and he was fixed for un-
pleasant or dangerous duty, he could be abso-
lutely relied on to go through with the job.
“Like a pony of mine,” one of the shearers
explained. “She was a wonderful little
devil at dodging the bit and saddle, but once
I was astride, she'd take me "through the
gates of Hell."
The Rat’s cheerfulness was not part of his
nature. If you caught him unawares his
face expressed abject misery ; but the moment
lie knew he was observed that impish grin
would reappear. lie was always singing.
Somehow he had picked up all the popular
Moody and San key hymn tunes. He ex-
plained once that the Salvation Army had fas-
cinated him when a boy. and that without
being actually converted he had been one of
its camp followers, lie had also learned the
words of countless music-hall ditties, senti-
mental. tragic and lewd, and sang them day
in and day out —to the hymn tunes. His
rendering 'of “The Little Bourke-street
Donahs” to the tune of “Onward. Christian
Soldiers” was a marvel of adaptation.
I got really interested in the poor little
beggar, and one night when he was on patrol
joyed him unexpectedly, with a tot of whisky.
A few judiciously placed leading questions
and I soon knew all there was to know about
bis life.
lie was born in a Melbourne slum —you
know we have a few even in Melbourne —and
had no recollection of his father; had seen him
only once when on holidays from the State
Penitentiary. His mother, when sober, earned
a little at the washtub, and turned her son
out at the age of seven to sell newspapers.
He knew nothing of the rights of property.,
and thieved from infancy; he knew nothing
of morals or responsibilities of citizenship.
Life to him was a real struggle for existence,
in which the cunning ones—not the strong,
but they who were quick of eye and fleet of
foot—survived. He had been first in reforma-
tories and then in gaol several times- —always
for petty thieving. To him the universal
enemy of society was “the cop.”
With great glee he told me of his adven-
tures with an old-time constable out Rich-
mond w r av. The constable knew in his own
mind that the Rat had been behind several
small robberies on his beat, but could not
prove it. But one night he was caught
redhanded. In his own words, "I was just
pinchin' a few shirts from a lorndry—hadn t
had a clean shirt for a month owin' to my
dud-washer gettin' my things mixed up with
Government House lingree. I was just
climbin’ back out o’ the winder with me little
parcel when who should come round the
corner but me old friend Tom Richards, the
cop. I drops the bundle. _He picks it up
and after me. I knoo ’e ’adn’t a ’ope of
coppin’ me. and thought I’d give ’im a bit of
exercise. Those big fat bludgers wants it,
the cows! So I keeps about fifty yards in
front, and trots along singin’ ‘When the John
’Op ’ops along the road.’ It was three
o'clock in the mornin’, and the only danger
was runnin’ into another cop. I leads ’im
down to Jenkin's-lane. a little, dark street.
I knoo the bottom o’ the lane was dug up—
he didn’t. I let’s him nearly catch up, and
then jumps for it. He didn’t jump. Blime.
he was in a mess! Two weeks in ’orspital!
The place was gettin’ too ’ot for me, so I
skips for camp and ’ere I am! Me! Sol-
dierin’ ! Gord, they must ha’ wanted blokes
to let me through!”
After that I kept a close eye on the Rat
—saved him from some of the ragging which
falls to the lot of the oddities of an army. I
even succeeded in getting him to adopt the
first plank of a moral code. It was useless
to preach against thieving, but I persuaded
him that it was wrong to pinch the goods of
any members of his own Company. In time
I believe I could have got him to respect the
property rights of the whole regiment, per-
haps of the whole army. But never of
civilians. The predatory instinct could not
be entirely subdued.
But he had one weakness from which it
was impossible to wean him. The greatest
music to him was “Up they go” ; the most
enthralling spectacle, two coins projected
upwards from a kip. You know how two-up
became our national recreation —'more so than
football —behind the lines. The Rat gambled

YOU May Have
Kidney Trouble!
'Every Picture
Tells a S
There is good cause to suspect your kidneys it
you have any stubborn pain in the small of the
back; for that is just where the kidneys are.
Heavy, throbbing backache
and sharp twinges when you
stoop or give your back a sud-
den twist tell you of inflamed
kidneys; kidneys sore, over-
worked and tired.
The kidneys have enough to
do when you are in good health
to filter the blood free of uric
poisons. Colds, fevers, over-
work or excesses of any sort
congest and overwork the kid-
neys. Unless promptly relieved,
what was at first a simple inflam-
mation will turn, in time, to
gravel, urinary trouble, dropsy,
lumbago, sciatica, rheumatism,
or some chronic form of kidney
disease.
If your kidneys are weak, take
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,
the remedy that has been used
for over fifty years and is so
well recommended by people
from all parts of Australia.

SYDNEY RESIDENT
CURED.
Mr. A. Bartle, No. 3 Gladstone
Street, Bexley. Sydney, says:—“Off
and on for years I suffered with dis-
ordered kidneys, the result being that
I was tortured with backache. When I
had a bad attack my back used to be
so stiff and lame that I could not even
turn in bed without suffering agony.
The kidney secretions were affected, be-
ing thick and cloudy with a red sedi-
ment. I was also subject to dizzy
attacks, and generally speaking felt far
from well. One day a friend, hearing
of a cure by Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills, urged me to try them. I bought
some without delay, and used them with
excellent results. The first bottle gave
relief, and five bottles made a complete
and perfect cure.”
Eight years later Mrs. Bartle says:
“Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured
my husband of backache and kidney
trouble over eight years ago, and he has
had no return of the complaint since.”

PILES AND ECZEMA CURED
BY DOAN’S OINTMENT.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
Eczema Cured.
Mrs. Horwitz, Ethelwood, Hayward
Street, Kensington, Sydney, says :—“I
sent for a pot of Doan’s Ointment, and
used it for Eczema on my little girl’s
forehead. The rash covered the brow
and it was around the eye as well. The
itching was frightful, and it made her
very fretful and kept her from sleeping.
I had used several preparation;, previous
to getting Doan’s Ointment, but none of
them gave more than passing relief. I
am pleased to tell you that this remedy
cured her completely. We have since
used it on another little girl with
equally good results. Doan’s Ointment
is splendid, and I advise its use in all
itching skin diseases.”
Eighteen years later Mrs. Horwitz
states: —“My daughter has not suffered
with Eczema since Doan’s Ointment
cured her eighteen years ago.”
Piles Cured,
Mrs. M. Brown, Toronto, Lyons Road,
Five Dock, Sydney, says “Three years
ago I used Doan’s Ointment for a bad
attack of Piles, and I am pleased to tell
you it completely cured me. Previous to
trying this ointment I tried all kinds of
remedies; but they gave me little or no
relief. I was suffering terribly when I
first applied Doan’s Ointment, and had
little hope of it doing me any good; but
its soothing and healing effects were
noticeable almost at once, and by the
time I had used one pot I was com-
K'etely cured. I am a great believer in
oan’s Ointment, and consider it the
best Pile remedy known. It cured me
after other remedies had failed.”
Four years later Mr£. Brown says:—
“I have had no return of my old com-
plaint since Doan’s Ointment cured me
about seven years ago.”

all his pay and possessions at the innermost
edge of that fatal ring. I can see him now,
squatted on his haunches, apelike, following
every toss with feverish eyes, yelling his
invocations to the coins as they spun in air,
and whimpering when the luck was against
him.
He was a coward only amongst his com-
rades, fawning to the occasional bullies you
hud in every Company, and living in con-
stant dread of summary punishment for his
constant breaking of minor articles of the sol-
diers’ code.
One night I chose him as my companion
on a visit to an extremely dangerous listen-
ing post. He never tried to evade a duty
which I was prepared to share. It was a
nasty job. We were within a hundred yards
of the Boche’s trenches, and if discovered
the only hope was a dash across open country
to our own trench .. . . And we were ' dis-
covered.
“Run for it!” I ordered, and in a second
we were dodging back, now up, now down,
running one moment, crawling the next, with
bullets from a dozen rifles winning about us.
The Rat could easily have beaten me in the
race. I remember noticing the remarkable
speed with which he started. He had very
long arms and used them like an ape in
scrambling for cover. But he looked back
and deliberately slackened speed. He took
no notice of my command to go on, and
tumbled into the trench behind me. They
must have pipped him just as he went over
—an ugly wound in the groin. The last I
saw of him for a long time was as he passed
into the ambulance singing from sheer joy
this time, for hospital meant a long spell
behind the lines.
I heard afterwards that the hospital staff
regarded him as an undesirable. His repu-
tation had gone before, and he was hardly
worth saving. Still, doctors and nurses did
their job, and six weeks later the Rat was
convalescing in Blighty.
I thought this would be the end of his
career as a soldier. It seemed certain that
he would try his hand with a jemmy and
finish up in some English gaol. But much
to my surprise he turned up again, limping
a little, smaller and thinner than ever, but
resplendent in a new uniform. He told me
that he had kept straight in London, and
that the uniform was responsible. It was
a queer confession.
“You see, Sergeant,” he said, “when I
stqj-ted picking things up here I didn’t feel
like a soldier. Knockin’ about in shorts
with a tunic that couldn't carry another
stitch was too much like, what I’d been
brought up to. But when I gets to London
they gives me a fresh rigout, and I finds
that us Diggers is thought a lot of. ’Sides
that, they treated us well, and I useter like
swaggerin’ down the Strand and ’earin’ folks
call out, ‘ ’Alio, Dig.!’ So I got to walkin’
straight up to cops and shakin’ ’ands with
them!”
I had been promoted to officer’s rank and
then did not see so much of the little man.
Then came a story that he was in trouble
for stealing again. I went into the matter
myself, and found that, amongst other trifles,
lie had annexed a kitten, a favorite pet of
certain hospital nurses. I learned from the
Rat that, as to this one item, he had not
stolen for gain. He loved cats, and had
brought this one back, as a mascotte for his
squad. So I saw the nurses and squared the
matter, the kitten being left with its new
owner.
He kept his pet in a box and took it for
air and exercise securely leashed to some old
straps. It was one of the jokes of our
corner, this perky little soldier leading his
kitten about whenever opportunity offered,
lie even took it into the front trenches with
him. box and all—shared his food with it,
combed it for vermin and sang to if. But
even on a battlefront cats are tickle, and one
day the mascotte was missing. The Rat was
inconsolable and developed signs of degen-
eracy. He was slipping back to slum
standards.
One night the men on duty in the front
trench heard the plaintive mewing of a cat,
and jokingly dared its guardian to go to
the rescue. One wag, with a perverted sense
of humor, told a harrowing tale of the tor-
tures inflicted by Germans on animals. Sud-
denly, without warning, monkey-fashion, the
Rat was over the top. After two hours had
passed his mates gave him up as lost. His
virtues and vices were dispassionately can-
vassed.
No one had liked him, and yet all ad-
mitted that there was “something about
him.” One hard-bitten warrior, the best
man in the company, summed him up as
“one of those mongrel pups coinin’ from no-
where that make up to a man. You chase
him away an’ be comes back. You kick him
hard, and find him next morning sleepin’
bn your boots. For a week or two you meet
him at every turn, just beyond kickin’ dis-
tance, with his ears pricked up, lookin’ at
you sideways, and later on you call him your
dog and like to feel him nozzlin’ around in
the dark.”
But all the German Army couldn’t kill
our Rat. Just before daybreak, coated with
mud and filth, he rolled into the trench,
trailing a German helmet and belt, and
with the kitten, half-starved and mangy,
safely tucked under bis arm. He had spent
the night in sundry shell-holes, and had met
a Boche out on some similar excursion.
“The dirty cow was after our mascotte;
but I was too quick for him,” he explained,
“and he won’t hunt no more kittens.”
The little man had gone through the Ger-
man for valuables, and passed over to his
sergeant a bundle of letters which contained
some useful information. On receiving
special thanks from the Colonel, the Rat
wore a hero’s halo for a few days with flag-
rant immodesty—and then did a month’s
punishment for claiming the natural right
of the great to exploit those beneath him.
I was down with enteric after that and
never saw my old company agaim Some
months later, however, I met my old shearer
and learned that the Rat had been wounded
again and sent back to Australia as totally
unfit for further service.
You can guess the rest. When the first
prisoner arraigned before us pleaded “not
guilty” I knew the voice. There he was
again, without his grin, a pitiful wastrel,
cringing to us “twelve upright men” for “an-
other charnce.” Wouldn’t you, in my place,
with my knowledge of his history, have
given him that “charnce”?

T*here was no answer from any of us,' but
the aggrieved merchant who started the dis-
cussion ordered another round of drinks.
GEO. S. BEEBY.
Harry’s Strategy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN squatter Roberts came on the
bloody carcases of a half-dozen of
his prize ewes, and saw the rest
of the flock (and it lambing time, too) split
into excited little mobs, lie swore profanely
and without repetition for three solid
minutes.
The culmination of the outrage was avidly
discussed that same Saturday night round
1 logan’s bar, when much comment was in-
dulged in as to who would be the lucky indi-
vidual to bag the dingo for whose scalp the
owner of the defunct ewes was offering a
reward of £4O. It was generally conceded
that Black Harry and Long Dick Withers
would be in at the death, hunting and wood-
craft generally being the breath of life to
each.
While the discussion still ran high Harry,
his white teeth flashing in a grin, came in.
Jn his hand he carried a rifle polished till if
winked, and round his waist tvas fastened a
cartridge belt, every clip agleam. Red, his
dog, was as usual at heel. The rifle and Red
were the pride of his life: but Red —Red was
probably dearer than the life itself.
The men greeted him hilariously, and good-
natured banter and taunts were launched at
him. Harry was quite unperturbed. Setting
the rifle in a corner he sauntered up to the
bar.
*‘Goin’ shooting ter-night, Harry?” drawled
someone.
Harry laid a hand proudly on his dog’s
head. "Me an’ Red,” he began, “las’ night
we has a talk. We says, me an’ Red, ‘Or-
right, Mr. Rober’s, orright. To-night we get
that yeller feller for you.’ And so”——
The shrug that accompanied the boast, the
nonchalant wave of the sooty hands, said as
eloquently as words that the thing was done.
Someone set a froth-topped mug at his
elbow, and he was invited to “Shut yer faco
in that, fer Gawd’s sake.”
Harry drained the mug and set it down
with a sigh of satisfaction, giving a prepara-
tory hitch to his trousers, “Eh, Red, oP
man, what about that ol’ dingo, eh?”
As the dog thumped heavily on the floor
with his great bushy tail, and licked eagerly
at his master’s hand, Black Harry threw
back his head and laughed round on the com-
pany. “See that? See him know, eh? Well,
we better go, me an’ Red,” and giving an-
other hitch to his trousers, he moved towards
his rifle.
The men burst into another roar. “Gripes,
Harry, on’y time for one pint ter-night?”
“Aw, don’t be ’ard on the yaller dorg, ’Arry.'
“Eh, Harry, tell you what—l bet Long Dick
beats you fer the yellow dog. Now, that’s a
bet.”
At the last remark Harry bristled. “Hah!”
he snorted. “Long Dick beat me an’ Red —•
hah!” He strode over, and picked up the
rifle. At the door he turned and faced them,
his nostrils dilating. “When Red an’ me
goes huntin’,” he said with lofty scorn, "that
yeller feller he dies, see!”
A chorus of laughter and cries of “Good
luck ter yer, Harry! Don’t forget to shout
ter-morrer,” followed him out into the night.
The night was a glorious one, brilliant with
moonlight, cool and fresh. The anger quickly
faded from Harry’s face as he strode pur-
posefully along, literally flinging the moon-
lit miles behind. He whistled softly as he
went, the dog padding silently at his heels.
Past Fraser’s holding, where a crop of
wheat stood solidly in the moonlight, through
a white gate into Denver’s, where a mob of
stores lowed and stamped suspiciously at
Red as they passed through. Past more
wheat crops, up two or three little, 'tree-
shadowed hills, across a stretch of plain,
ghostly in the moonlight, with its freight of
white ring-barked trees. Then through a
tightly-strained six-wire fence, and so on to
Roberts’s property. Proceeding cautiously
now for another half-mile, he came on the
blackened stump of an old eoolabali-tree.
Glancing keenly round, he gave a gi’unt of
satisfaction, and settled himself in the black
shadows, motioning Red down beside him.
The sheep were camped to the right of the
stump, some distance up the slope.
The night was alive with noises. The wag-
tail chirped in a near-by tree, a mopoke
howled unhappily, and a band of curlews
rent the air with goblin melody. Red shiv-
ered, and licked at the hand nearest him.
Curlews were his pet aversion.
Then Black Harry joined his voice tojthose
other voices of the night. “Wa-ho-o-o-o!”
he howled. “Wa-lio-o-o-o-o!”
The sound drifted eerily away into the
night, and the neck-hair of the dog bristled
under Harry’s hand.
“Wa-lia-lioo,” he liowded again, and felt
a glow of pride at the naturalness of- his
achievement. “Gripes, I bin think I a
dingo meself nex’!”
The minutes dragged into an hour, and
still the two sat on, alert shadows in the
shadowy depths of the old coolabah stump,
the dingo howl rising on a weird, wild
00-o-o-o-o-o every few minutes.
Suddenly man and dog stiffened. An
answering howl had come from over the hill.
Harry gave back howl for howl, as the
newcomer gradually drew near. There was
silence for a while, and Harry thought he
detected a flitting shape in the trees.
With a hand on Red’s collar he pushed
the dog, bristling and growling low, out of
the shadow of the stump into the broad
moonlight, howling long and enticingly as
he did so.
There was a flare, a crash, and the howl
died in Harry’s throat as the dog crumpled
up under his hand.
Lang Dick Withers bounded across the
slope. “For God’s sake, Harry, don’t say I
shot yer!” he cried. “I thought Red—l—l
—Harry, yer ain’t shot, are yer?”
Harry’s face was upturned in the moon-
light for a moment. It was tortured.
“Aw, Dick, you bin shoot my mate —my
mate!” he sobbed, and crouched over the
lifeless body again.
