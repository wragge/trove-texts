FOR THE RED RAGE.
The Procession of Egos.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On each side of him for many a mile extended a
pebbled beach shut in by hazy headlands. The
quiet sea chafed gently at his feet on a myriad
little stones—once hugest boulders, now worn by
unwearied Time into minutest and most diverse
shapes.
lie stooped and separated one stone from its
fellows—it was so very circular. It was somewhat
flat ; about the size of a small coin.
Coincidence has done this, he thought ; or
rather Chance. My finding it makes the coinci-
dence. Yes : Chance alone has formed it so.
Then . . . what chance ?
The Philosopher put the little stone disc in his
pocket and walked home, considering deeply. He
proceeded at once to his laboratory and measured
the granite fragment with his most delicate in-
struments. To their mechanism, capable of dis-
criminating to a thousandth part of an inch, the
circle of the thing was round, try it which way he
would —round absolutely. The Philosopher was
disturbed.
He leaned his head upon his hands, with his
eyes fixed upon the insignificant pebble placed on
the table before him.
“It seems to me,” he mused, “it is no mere
speculation. It is a certainty—it must be. Yet I
will place the argument on paper so that no error
may creep in.”
He was trembling as he took a pen and wrote.
* * * *
Either Something exists, or Nothing. If No-
thing exists, conceptions cannot exist. But I can
conceive existence. Therefore my conception
exists.
Yet my conception cannot exist apart from Me.
Therefore I exist.
And I am Something—Matter, Spirit, what you
please, Therefore Something exists, I will call
that Something Matter.
Existence implies location in Space. If a thing
existed nowhere it would not exist. Therefore
it must exist somewhere.
Existence implies location in Time. If a thing
existed for no-time it would not exist. There-
fore it must exist some-time.
But the conception of Space implies an infinity
of Space. If Space be not infinite, it must have a
material boundary. But if that boundary be not
infinite, itself must have a material boundary,
and so on —to infinity.
And, for similar reasons, the conception of Time
implies an infinity of Time.
Therefore Matter exists in an infinity of Space
and Time.
But if Space and Time be infinite, why not
Matter? The eternal repetition of Matter is at
least as likely as its sudden cessation. So far as
human knowledge extends, Matter is eternally
repeated.
And, so far as human knowledge extends, Matter
is identical in essence. There is at least as much
likelihood that its primal elements will remain the
same as there is that they will change to some-
thing inconceivably different.
I may assume, therefore, that there exists an
Infinity of Identical Matter in an Infinity of Space
and Time.
That Matter must be held or governed by a
condition of its own existence—since Space and
Time are abstractions. I will call that condition
Law.
And as Matter is identical, the Law which
governs it must also be identical.
This pebble in all its remarkable rotundity was
formed by what we call Chance, which in its last
analysis is only an expression of Law, and is cer-
tain and entirely inflexible.
Given Sea, and Stone, and Time long enough, a
shape such as this must have been formed.
And if this shape, in the changes which Time
never-ending must bring, then every and any
other shape.
But Time is not operating in its chances on this
World alone, but on all other Worlds which it has
formed, extending in Space inimitably.
Therefore other discs the very counterpart of
this must exist in other Worlds.
But, the Worlds being unlimited in number, the
perfect discs must be unlimited.
And all other shapes must be as limitless in
number as the Worlds themselves.
But Chance must repeat the shape and charac-
teristics of this World as it repeats the discs.
Some Worlds, therefore, Chance must have made
in physical formation exactly similar to this.
And, as the Worlds are unlimited, and Time has
never begun nor yet can end, some World must
be so like that the similarity will extend to every
islet, to every rock, to every pebble, and to that
pebble’s exact position on the sea-beach as,.l
found this.
Chance, then, in its infinite variety, now holds
sway over a World the precise replica of this in
everything—with like human beings, like laws,
customs, languages, and religions—like to the
tiniest grain of sand, and to the most transient
thought flickering through a brain—a perfect
identity.
There must be therefore a Man like the —of my
name—of my past—a Man who is now writing
what I am now writing—who is now thinking
what I am now thinking—who picked up lately,
as I did, a remarkable pebble.
But, | as there is a limitless series of Worlds
subject to Chance, there must be a limitless series
of Worlds such as this.
Andi there must as necessarily be an infinite
series of
• * * *
He broke off here—the room seemed so small
and its confines so insupportable. He went out
into the night wind, which enveloped him with its
grateful chill.
A swart cloud hung sullen under the face of the
moon. Before him there crouched in the dark-
ness kn undefined mass. -It was a rugged hill,
strewn with rocks and smoothed boulders. He
gaine'd the summit, and bared his head to the
stronger breeze. The cloud had moved and no
longer prevented the moon’s light.
And the Philosopher now became aware of a
rhythmic murmur— not loud and thundering, but
enormous in its pervasiveness. Tramp!— it
sounded . . . tramp ! . . . tramp!
The man looked at the landscape below and saw
at first dimly, then quite distinctly, an expanse of
people. It was the noise of their walking he had
heard as they marched past the hill with measured
and unhurried step. They entirely filled the view,
save on the side on which he stood, and they rolled
on as a sea that rolls to meet the Sea.
Looking still more intently, the Philosopher per-
ceived with a terror, the like of which he had
never imagined before, that every man of the
crowd was a likeness of himself dreadful in its
exactness.
Yet they paid no sort of Attention to him, but
continued their solemn way.
Impelled by a strange curiosity, he shouted
to them :
“ Where do I come from ? ”
He hacf intended to say—“ Where do you come
from?” but in some inexplicable way, and in
spite of himself, he was compelled to say “I”
instead of “you.”
Then all who marched below, to the most remote
of them, turned their heads backwards and peered
with contracted brows, and peered most curiously,
and said ali in one great voice, enquiringly, yet
somewhat sadly withal :
“ Where do I come from ? ”
Then he asked again, being again impelled to
say “ I” instead of “you” :
“ How far do I extend ? ”
And all the men who marched below suddenly
raised themselves a-tip-toe to look over one an-
other’s heads, and answered blankly :
“ How far do I extend ?”
And once more, notwithstanding his fear, he
asked a further question, not this time essaying to
speak the word “ you,” for it was impossible:
“ Where am I going ? ”
And at this question all the landscape of faces
with the moonlight on them turned towards him,
and looked at him with frightful mockery, and
answered :
“ Where am I going ? ”
But the sound of their voice was so loud and
pervading that the hill on which he stood quivered
to its rooted depths. Its cliffs rose from the earth
and flung themselves headlong down sheer steeps.
Massy stones lying squat starred and split to their
bellied bases. The rounded granite pebbles
crumbled into dust. The moon herself, serenest
of spheres, darkened her ray and trembled in her
silver chains. And the stars sparkled fitfully
and sought vainly to forsake their customed
paths. Ndr was the sound unfelt by the nether
and piled universes for ever.
He hastened down the quaking hillside and
joined the infinite throng.

[One of the strongest poetic forces in America works
through the dialect-verse which has sprung up so abun-
dantly of late years. And, when the dialect isn’t over-
done, the appeal is instantaneous.- Some of James
Whitcomb Riley’s verse (“ Leonainie ’.’ and “When the
Frost is on the Punkin ”) was reprinted in The Bulletin
not long ago. He was born at Gianfield, in the State of
Indiana, in 63, and is still writing. He began manly
life as a sign-painter (Henry Lawson can flourish brushes
with him), then joined a company of strolling actors for
whom he would dish-up plays and write songs and verses,
and by degrees drifted into lecturing and journalism.
“ Benj. F. Johnson, of Boone,” was his beginning
pen - name ; but people gave him the title of
“ the Hoosier poet,” because he wrote chiefly in the
Hoosier or Indiana dialect. (Why “ Hoosier ” doesn’t
appear). There is in him a vein of true poetry, and
some of his un-dialect-verse is good, though not quite as
forcible as that which has made him popular. Sam Walter
Foss (The Bulletin recently reprinted his “ Hullo ! ” and
“Keep-a-Goin’ !”)is,in his best things, fully Riley’s equal,
but he has not writ ten so much or so variously. He springs
from New Hampshire, a r) is five years younger than
Riley. At last accounts he was editing the Yankee
Blade, a Boston newspaper in which most of his verse
has appeared. Mather Dean Kimbali (there are several
poetic Kimballs in America) is the oldest of the trio,
dating as far back as ’49. He hails from Wisconsin—
still.]
THE OLD MAN AND JIM.
Old man never had much to say—
’Coptic 1 to J im—
And Jim was the wildest boy he had—
And the Old Man jes’ wrapped up in him I
Never heerd him speak but once
Er twice in my life—and first time was
When the army broke out, and Jim he went,
The Old man backin’ him, fer three months.
And all ’at I heerd the Old man say
Was, jes’ as we turned to start away:
“Well ; good-bye, Jim :
Take keer of yourse’f 1 ”
'Peared-like, he was more satisfied
Jes’ lookin’ at Jim,
And likin’ him all to hisse’f-like, see?
’Cause he was jes’ wrapped up in him I
And over and over I mind the day
The Old man come and stood round in the way
While we was drillin’, a-watchin’ Jim—
Aud down at the deepot a-heerin’ him say t
“ Well; good-bye, Jim :
Take keer of yourse'f 1 ”
Never was nothin’ about the farm
Disting’ished Jim;
Neighbors all ust to wonder why
The Old man ’peared wrapped up in him.
But when Cap. Biggler, he writ back,
’At Jim was the bravest boy we had
In the whole dern rigiment, white er black,
And his fightin’ good as his farmin’ bad—
’At he had led, with a bullet clean
Bored through his thigh, and carried the flag
Through the bloodiest battle you ever seen—
The Old man wound up a letter to him
’At Cap. read to us, ’at said : “ Tell Jim
Good-bye:
And take keer of hisse’f.’
Jim come back jes’ long enough
To take the whim
’At he’d like to go back in the cavelry—
And the Old man jes’ wrapped up in him 1
Jim ’lowed ’at he’d had sich luck afore,
Guessed he’d tackle her three years more.
And the Old man give him a colt he’d raised
And follered him over to Camp Ben Wade,
And laid around fer a week er so,
Watchin’ Jim on dress-parade—
Tel finally he rid away,
And last he heerd was the Old man say—
“ Well; good-bye, Jim :
Take keer of yourse’f ! ”
Tuk the papers, the Old man did,
A-watchin : fer Jim—
Fully believin’ he’d make his mark
Some way—jes’ wrapped up in him !
And many a time the word ’u’d come
'At stirred him up like the tap of a drum—•
At Petersburg fer instance, where
Jim rid right into their cannons there,
And tuk ’em, and p’inted ’em t’other way,
And socked it home to the boys in grey,
As they skooted fer timber, and on and on—
Jim a lieutenant and one arm gone,
And the Old man’s words in his mind all day—
“ Well; good-bye, Jim :
Take keer of yourse’f ! ”
Think of a private, now, perhaps,
We’ll say like Jim,
’At’s dumb clean up to the shoulder-straps—
And the Old man jes wrapped up in him I
Think of him —with the ;war plum’ through,
And the glorious old Red-White-and-Blue
A-laughin’ the news down over Jim,
And the Old man, bendin’ over him—
The surgeon turnin’ away with tears
’At had n’t leaked fer years and years—
As the hand of the dyin’ boy clung to
His father’s, the old voice in his ears—
“ Wel l; good-bye, Jim :
Take keer of yourse’f ! ”

TELLIN' WHAT THE BABY DID.
In the cosy twilight hid,
Tellin’ what the baby did,
Sits Matilda every night
’Twixt the darkness and the light.
Tells me in her cutest way
All the hist’ry of the day,
Gives me all; leaves nothin’ hid,
Tellin’ me what the baby did.
Beats the whole decline and fall
Of the Roman Empire. Gol!
William Shakespeare never hed
Cuter thoughts than baby said.
An’ he hez, to sing his thoughts
Sweeter words than Isaac Watts.
Tildy, she leaves nothin’ hid
Tellin’ me what the baby did.
Pooty hard schoolmarm is Fate
To her scholars, small and great}
I hev felt upon my han’
Tingle of her sharp rattan ;
But she pities our distress,
An’ she gives a glad recess,
When Matilda sits, half-hid,
Tellin’ what the baby did.
Trudge off with my dinner pail
Every mornin’ without fail;
Work, with hardly time for breath j
Come home, tired half to death j
But I feel a perfect rest
Settle down upon niy breast,
Settin’, by the twilight hid,
Hearin’ what the baby did.
Sometimes I cannot resist,
An’ I s.,ake my doubled fisc
In the face of fate, and swear,
“ You don’t treat a fellow fair 1 ”
Then when I go home at night,
My whole system full of fight,
Tilly, she sits there, half-hid,
Tellin’ what the baby did.
Then I jest make up with fate,
An’ my happiness is great;
But if fate should lay its han*
On that baby, understan’,
Through the worl’ I’d sulk apart,
With red murder in my heart;
If she sat no more half-hid,
Tellin’ what the baby did.

To find a shady place ’nd snooze,

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HE ARNE.—Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
trealment had failed. For a year previous I had been
gel ting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medioine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney."
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
“ 1 bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured. —J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne's Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

their old lustre. The blood-giving principle of the medi-
cine secures a healthy appearance, the patient finds
himself gaining in weight and flesh, hollow and sunken
cheeks become rounded , the weak and debilitated consti-
tution is restored, and the former sufferer finds himself
permanently cured with all the animation and vigor of
life.

Dr. GIBBOKTS, 1
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS So SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are'those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of !
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symiJtoms, namely :— Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade,' tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow’ during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt of 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without.loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope. • ■ ,

“ e " T. B. KENNY, Solicitor.
64 Clarence Street, Sydney, N.S.W.,
September 6,1895.
,“I merely wish voluntarily to testify t,o the
ejificacy of Warner’s ‘ Safe ’ Cure, although I
am.inclined to think it almost superfluous,
seeing the number of similar ones from all
parts of the civilised world; nevertheless, I
must add my quota for the benefit of my fel-
low creatures.
I need not particularise, but say that I was
a sufferer from weakness and debility conse-
querit upon long residence in foreign coun-
tries, the climates of which were very varied
and extreme, and have been completely re-
stored to the full vigour of health by using
Warner’s ‘Safe 1 Cure.” XHO SLOA N.
Bendigo, Victoria,
. „ January 17, 1896.
“ 1 was a victim to liver disease, and grew
worse, although treated by several medical
men. I then began taking Warner’s • Safe ’
Cure, and three bottles afforded relief, and
when I had. used a dozen bottles 1 was cured.
To show the permanency of the cure I should
add that this was some six years ago.”

When you go out shopping, consider, think
of the money in your pocket, and take account
of the many stores whose various attractions
are laid before you. There is A, with temp-

B, whose wiles are innumerable ; and 0,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PYGMALION.
The afternoon is late, and holds
A sense, of golden peace ;
The roses shut their crimson folds,
Jaded with slow release.
In cold, white purity she stands,
Beyond a mortal sweet;
Down fall the tools, and with looked hands
The sculptor clasps her feet.
His heart bows in the scented gloom,
Through love and longing weak :
He knows not of the rosy bloom
On heaving breast and cheek !

THE OUTCAST.
I. /. .
Across, the night, where shadows deep .
Are slumb’ring like a wrong asleep,
I hear a constant cry of pain . . .
And, out at sea, the wind and rain.
What mean these sounds of sorrow drear ?
What mean these piteous xnoans I hear ?
What is it, Sister in the Park ?
What is it, Woman in the Dark ?
I cannot think, or work, or rest,
Because you sob and moan unblest;
I cannot live my life and know
That you are cursed in shame and woe.
II.
Cry at my heart no more ! I will
Not heed ! Depart to whence you came !
Depart ! and keep your clamour still,
For I am weary of your woes
That never cease ; your burning shame ;
Your life that dark and darker grows.
I have not made you what you are ;
I did not spurn you while you clung ;
/did not bid you stand afar.
Entreat me not; let me be free;
Of such as you the knell is rung :
Stand back ! You shall not torture me.
III.
It is no use ; I may not feign ;
I could not-shut my ears, and say„
I would not hear—all night, all day—■
Your everlasting cry of .pain.
I thought I need not heed your voice,
And built a future while I slept;
But, waking, knew that you still w;ept, ,
And had no dreams of hope or choice
Of joyous things. I flung you gold,
Yet held from you my best. But know
The truth at last: now will I go
And call you mine, your form enfold
Will kiss your lips, and soothe your c?y ;,
Your head upon my breast keep still; •
Nor cease to lift you up, until
We equal live, or fighting die.

EVOLUTION.
Amid the whirl of molten suns,
The tempest and the fire,
God saw his worlds by millions
Fashioned to his desire ;
And while through heaven the warm earth flew
The reign of soul began,
And gentler still and nobler grew
The brute that would be man. ,
But, ere the first clear utterance came,
With vaunting look and sign,
God saw his new-born men proclaim
Their ancestry divine;
And still the cooling earth ran round,
And, lord of beast and fruit,
Each age more fierce and cruel found > |
The man that was the brute.
’Tis true man fell, as priests avow,
But scarcely from a star — • <
Brute-born at first, and lower now
Than these our brothers are.
What tree may flaunt its boughs in air
Self-severed from the roots ? ,i
We are but men because we were
The best among the brutes..
Ah, brother brutes, forgive the sin
That thought your name disgrace;
Knowing our heirship, we, your kin,
Shall yet regain our place. ;
For slowly, slowly cools the earth
By millions yet untrod,
And still there’s time to bring to birth
The man that shall be God.

SATURDAY, AUGUST 8, 1896
The Futility of it All.
For the last two weeks or more the Parlia-
ment and the press of New South Wales have
sawed the air furiously over Premier Reid’s
wondrous financial statement, and his alleged
surplus, and about the tangled monetary
affairs of the province generally. Except for
the riot which greeted the famous Carter
budget in Victoria a year or two ago, there
has been no such widespread curse pro-
nounced on any Treasurer’s balance-sheet
within the last decade. It has been demon-
strated, among other things, that the £330,000
surplus was created by charging about
£1,000,000 of ordinary expenditure to loans,
by taking over £300,000 out of loans and
putting it into revenue on account of certain
things which are alleged to have happened
as much as 40 years back, by charging
£216,000 of the road-and-bridge expenditure
of ’95 and ’96 to the Dibbs Government of
1893, by charging all the unpaid bills of pre-
vious years back to these years and by
charging all this year’s unpaid bills forward
to next year, by debiting the forest-thinning
job to loans and paying for the sand-shifting
business at Centennial Park out of the trust
funds, and by many other wiles and devices.
Ex-Treasurer M’Millan, who was for many
years the great brass god of Foreign-trade
finance, and whose absolute reliability on
monetary matters has been guaranteed over
and over again by the S.M. Herald and
Telegraph and Evening News, declared
in the Assembly that the surplus was a
trick and a hollow falsehood, and that
the Reid Government had had a deficit
of about £600,000 a year ever since it
came into office. And after all this ex-
posure, and the utter destruction of any
reputation as a financier which Premier Reid
might ever have possessed, and the wreckage
of his character for ingenuousness and fair-
dealing, the public may now sit down to
seriously consider the futility of it all. For
the miserable, exploded budget must needs
go through, and the “faked” estimates be
endorsed by the Assembly, because the
system of Government by Contradiction re-
quires it, and all the bustle and riot might
almost as well not have been.
* * * *
One of the principal fictions of the Parlia-
mentary system is that the Assembly has
control of the finances. As a matter of fact,
it has no control worth mentioning and no
direct control at all. If the Assembly in-
sisted upon straightening up the Reid
budget and upon putting right all the crooked
things which are in it, and on fixing the
national balance-sheet on an honest footing,
it would constitute a vote of censure and the
Reid Ministry must resign. That fact alone
would not matter much to the Freetrade
majority in the Assembly, because it could
find abundant material in the party for' a
better Ministry than the one now existing.
But the same vote which put Reid out would
put Lyne and the Protectionist party in, and
the result would be a tariff which the govern-
ing party is pledged to oppose, and the House
would have no more direct control over
Lyne’s financial doings, if he chose to cook
the national balance-sheet as Reid has done,
than it has over the ancient muddler who
now runs the Treasury. The Assembly has
to vote that Reid’s budget is quite honest
and reliable, however much it knows to the
contrary, unless it is also prepared to vote
against Foreign-trade and direct taxation,
and all the other items of the Government
policy. Not being prepared to do this, all
the criticisms levelled at the budget are
merely a grinding of the empty wind in the
mill of useless logic, and a weary slaying of
the corpse of rhetoric all over again.
* ♦ * *
The Foreign-trade party is perfectly aware
that, whatever chance its policy might have
had if run by an honest and brainy states-
man, the small police-court trickeries of
Premier Reid are dragging it down into the
mire of utter discredit. But as it can’t get
rid of its foolish incubus without abandon-
ing power and office, and handing them over
to its opponents, and pulling the whole struc-
ture down on its own head, it naturally sticks
by its leader and swears that all his doings
are perfectly right and honorable. The
Foreign-trade press does likewise for the
same reason, and laboriously whitewashes its
hated idol in massive slabs of print. The
Protectionist party press, for an exactly
similar reason, denounces everything that
Reid says or does, provided its political
figure-head, Lyne, denounces it also. When
Lyne comes into power the press which be-
longs exclusively to his party will have to
prove that everything he says or does is ab-
solutely correct, because sacrificing him
would mean sacrificing the national policy
along with him, so its position is just the
same as that of its contemporaries.
• * * *
The state of the Labor-party is, if pos-
sible, a trifle more difficult than that of the
direct Foreign-trade section of the House.
The. majority of the Labor members are
Protectionists. They are also in favor of
land and income-taxes, and when Lyne
offered them one part of the democratic pro-
gramme—Protection—and Reid offered them
the other—direct taxation—they had to
choose between the two, because under the
party system Lyne and Reid were the only
alternatives. They decided to sacrifice Pro-
tection for the sake of direct taxation, 'and
they got a land-tax which was a very weak
apology for the one they expected, and
which the present Government flatly refuses
to extend any further. Now, having sacri-
ficed Protection in order to get the land-tax,
they have to make a further sacrifice and
vote their full confidence in the honesty of
Reid’s- dishonest finance in order to keep it.
There is no practical way provided by the
constitution whereby they can vote for Pro-
tection and direct taxation, or for Protection
and direct taxation and against the glaring
manipulation of the public accounts, simply
because two extraneous party leaders, with
neither of whom the Labor members have any
connection whatever, choose to decide, for
reasons which don’t in the least interest the said
members, that these matters shall not go to-
gether. One of the standing jibes of the Free-
trade press is that the Labor-members
generally speak bitterly against the Ministry
and vote with it. In this respect they are at
least honest, which the rank-and-file of the
other parties are not. Circumstances practi-
cally compel them—or at least the party con-
siders thatcircumstancescompel them—to vote
with the Government, but circumstances don’t
necessarily compel them to lie about it by
professing to fully approve of all its doings.
The position of a party which generally
speaks against the Ministry yet votes with it
is about the most logical thing that the sys-
tem admits of when worked on a peace basis;
it simply means that the party regards the
Government as generally wrong but votes
with it because otherwise it would bring in a
Government which would, in its opinion, be
wrong still more frequently. The truly logi-
cal course would probably be for the Third
Party to put matters on a permanent war
basis by voting strictly according to its con-
science and its Democratic instincts every
time. In that case it would gain nothing in
the immediate present, but it might bring
about a political crisis once a month or so,
and the utter impossibility of the situation
might compel Parliament to abandon Party
Government altogether.
* * * *
In South Australia the Kingston Ministry
has included in its programme the creation
of an Elective Executive, and a bill to estab-
lish the same system has just got through
its second reading in Maoriland, despite
the bitter opposition of Premier Seddon.
The establishment of this system is, in
The Bulletin’s opinion, the only process by
which Parliament will ever acquire any real
power over the finances, or over anything
else. It provides that the members of the
Cabinet shall be elected for a fixed term—say
three years —unless sooner removed by a
definite vote of the House. The contract
between them and the House will contain no
tacit proviso, as at present, that Parliament
shall have blind confidence in them, and sup-
port them in all their actions until it throws
them out altogether and gives the same
blind support to another crowd equally un-
trustworthy. It will simply announce that
Parliament regards them as the best men it
can get, and guarantees their salaries, and
retains its independence. Under this system
the present situation in N.S. Wales would be
widely different from what it is. If the
Assembly considered that the Reid budget
was a gross misrepresentation, it would have
full power to alter or correct it without
thereby ejecting Reid or sacrificing Freetrade
or direct taxation, or anything else. It would
not be expressing “ want of confidence ” in
the Government, for there would be no ques-
tion of confidence, as it is now understood, in
the bargain. If the Foreign-trade majority
considered that Reid, and any other member
or members of the Ministry, were hopeless
muddlers who were bringing its policy into
disrepute, it could remove them by a vote of
the House and put better men in their
places ; removing a Ministry wouldn’t neces-
sarily mean sacrificing the whole policy of
the party and putting a totally opposite crowd
into power, and therefore no party would be
compelled to endorse the dishonest or foolish
acts of its leaders simply for its own preser-
vation.
* * * *
Under the elective system an aggressive
Premier could not bulldoze his followers into
obedience by threats of a dissolution, and
ruinous election expenses, and possible loss
of their seats ; the House could only be dis-
solved before its time by its own vote. He
couldn’t coerce them, either, by threatening to
resign and advise the Governor to send for
the possibly still more obnoxious Opposition
leader, for if he resigned the choice of his
successor would rest with the House itself.
The Labor-party wouldn’t then be compelled
to sacrifice Protection to get direct taxation
or to prop up dishonest financing to keep it.
The House could give a straight vote on
every question without thereby upsetting a
Ministry or a policy, and Reid would not be
able to ukase that the members who wanted
direct taxation must sacrifice Protection to
get it, or Lyne to decree that those who
wanted Protection could only have it by
abandoning direct taxation. No Minister
could buy office by offering concessions to
different factions, for the House itself would
be the only power which could offer any
concessions. There would not be one party
which was compelled by the exigencies of the
political system to support the Government
even when it was wrong, or another which was
called upon to denounce it even when it was
right. The House would not be virtually
compelled, as it is now, to keep the whole
Ministry or wreck the whole Ministry in
order to retain or get rid of one individual
in it about whose appointment it had not
even been consulted. The elective system
might possibly prove far from perfect, but
that, at the worst, is only a possibility. The
utter unworkableness and corruption and
chaos of the present system are absolute
certainties.
* * * *
The Labor-party is the only body in New
South Wales politics which advocates the
elective system, and even it does so in a
feeble fashion and puts this reform far down
on its programme. Yet the party has already
proved that it can do very little good under
the present order of things ; almost all it
has done, in fact, has been to secure One-
man-one-vote and a small measure of direct
taxation, and to obtain this last reform it had
to sacrifice one equally important which the
country had previously gained. Therefore,
it should think seriously about putting the
elective-Government idea first on its pro-
gramme, and making this reform the sole
price of its support. When it is gained,
then everything else will be possible. As
things are now, the political machine moves
so slowly and so rustily, and the processes of
Party Government are such a complete essay
on the art of not being able to do things,
that progress is too slow to be worth men-
tioning.
Some More Loan Estimates.
In a recent issue The Bulletin took occasion
to discourse on “ the Borrowing Boom ” in Aus-
tralia, and particularly in N.S. Wales, and
urged the necessity of defining by Act of Par-
liament what kind of works should be charged
to loan-moneys and what should be charged to
revenue. It advocates this legal definition for
several reasons more or less effective. It will
draw the attention of the country to the
matter ; the Loan Estimates go through so un-
obtrusively that very few people are really
aware how the thing is worked. It will also
draw the attention of the people who lend the
money, and thereafter they will lend it with
their eyes open—or, if they don’t, the fault
will be their own. It will put all Treasurers on
a level, whereas, as matters now stand, the dis-
honest Treasurer who makes a surplus by using
borrowed money for road-repairs and all manner
of other ordinary expenditure is a heaven-born
financier, while the honest one who doesn’t is
driven out of office, either for having a deficit
or for increasing taxation, and is a failure either
way. It is generally believed by the commu-
nity that New South Wales borrows money for
reproductive works only—that is, for works
which yield an actual cash revenue to the
Treasury. The following list shows what kind
of works Parliament has authorised to be con-
structed with borrowed money during the past
twelve years, and damages this public impres
sion rather severely :
Non-revenue-pro- Revenue-producing

* * * *
Ihe date put against each item is the vear in
which the expenditure was authorised by Par-
liament. Many of these works are not vet
finished ; some of them, in fact, are hardly
commenced ; but they have all been dulv sanc-
tioned, and most of them have been completed,
or are very nearly completed. Those which are
still in suspense include productive and unpro-
ductive works indiscriminately, so the money
actually spent is probably divided between the
two classes in about the same proportions as
shown above. The figures are taken from
the loan accounts just issued by the
N.S.W. Government. The list might have
been carried back many years further, but 1884
was chosen for a point of commencement for
several reasons. One was that, though the
fraud complained of has existed, more or less,
from the beginning of the borrowing system, it
was only after 1884 that it developed to any
serious extent. Another was that the remote
past is dead, and the people who swindled the
country then are mostly dead also, and there is
no one of any importance left alive to call to
account for the misdeeds of these days.
* * * *
The above figures show, with tolerable clear-
ness, why New South Wales has a surplus one
year and a deficit the next. In 1885, for
example, no loan was authorised, therefore
there was no chance to charge the ordinary
road and bridge expenditure of that year to
borrowed money, and a big deficit resulted. In
1886 the amount of the ordinary expenditure
thus “faked” was very small and another
deficit resulted. In 1887, again, no loan was
authorised, and the road and bridge and
other casual requirements of that year
couldn’t conveniently be passed on to pos-
terity, so presumably they came out of revenue,
and some more big deficit naturally ensued.
In 1888, however, a great and patriotic Govern-
ment arose and squared the national balance-
sheet, and produced a surplus of half-a-million.
That was the year when nearly £1,500,000 of
what should have been current expenditure for
bridges, gaols, dredging works, repairs to streets
and wharves, gunpowder and other military
stores, and the like, was shoved unobtrusively
into a new loan, to the great relief of the
revenue. In 1889 the same Government had a
deficit of £lBl,OOO, the simple and obvious
explanation being that the amount paid out of
loans for road-making, wood-blocking of streets,
bridges, gaols, and miscellaneous jobs and
repairs was only about .£l,loo,ooo—consider-
ably less than in the great surplus year of 1888.
In 1890 there was another small surplus, and
the charging of nearly .£1,200,000 of ordinary
expenditure to loans at least partly explains its
existence. In 1891-2-3 the loan money swindle
was almost extinct for the time being—possibly
because loans were almost unobtainable just
then; but by heavy increases of taxation a
much-execrated Treasurer managed to get
through with a small surplus and two moderate
deficits. The reason of the alleged financial
prosperity of ’94 and ’95 is partly to be found
in the “ cash basis ” system of accountancy,
and partly in the figures shown above. This
particular loan swindle isn’t the whole reason
of the province’s financial fluctuations, but it
is one reason, and the principal one.
• * » •
Very few people —probably very few politi-
cians even—fully understand the wild humor of
the loan-mongering business in New South
Wales. By far the largest proportion of last
year’s Public Works loan was for building
bridges, repairing old wooden bridges, making
roads, wood-blocking streets, thinning out-
forests, constructing gaols, lunatic asylums and
other works which yield nothing whatever
towards paying interest on their cost. And
some of these bridges that are now built with
borrowed money are to replace old, worn-out
bridges which have not yet been paid for, and
some of these latter probably replaced still
older ones for which the bill is still outstand-
ing. The original wharf at the foot of Erskine-
street, Sydney, was built with borrowed money
in ’56, and when it fell to pieces about ’9o—
Bulletin can’t trace any other unpaid-for
wharf in between, but there may have been one
—another was built, also with borrowed money,
and it will probably have to be shortly re-
moved in order to make room for a big steam-
boat wharf built with borrowed money also.
Yet the bill for that old wharf of ’55 is as far
from being liquidated as ever it was, or as
the bill for the 1890 one now is. The
roadway at Circular Quay, Sydney, has
been reconstructed at least three times and
charged to loans every time. Almost all the
old locomotives which have worn themselves
into scrap-iron, and the old railway carriages
which have become matchwood, and the old
trucks which have gone to dust since the rail-
ways first began, are not paid for even now.
The original Sydney General Post Office was
built with borrowed money, and the cost of
pulling it down was defrayed out of borrowed
money, and the present one was built with
borrowed money, and all these bills are still
outstanding, and will probably be outstanding
when the next G.P.O. is wanted. The first
Sydney water-supply, which has been long since
superseded, is an unpaid debt even now.
There is hardly in all the province a closed and
abandoned road, or a worn-out punt or dredge,
or an obsolete telegraph instrument, orasilted-
up river, or the memory of a wharf which fell
to pieces 20 years ago, which doesn’t represent
some part of the “ reproductive and permanent”
assets which are supposed to be good security for
the public debt of Botany Bay.
* * * *
Still, though the great Public Works swindle
is very old, it is only within the last ten or
twelve years that it assumed serious dimensions
and became the permanent, reliable swindle it
now is. Also, it is only within the last year


that non-productive jobs began to represent the
largest part of the loan-expenditure, and when
forest-thinning became one of the recognised
“ public works.” N.S. Wales now spends some
£600,000 a year of borrowed money on bridges
and buildings and other ephemeral enterprises
which yield no revenue. And it must
keep on building bridges, &c., at this rate
for probably another 100 years before the
province is fairly opened up, and every
year the interest on the unproductive debt
grows more and more, till at last it alone
will amount to probably <£1,000,000 per annum ;
and, as the bridges and other things multiply,
the time must come when another ,£300,000 or
£400,000 or £500,000 a year will have to be
borrowed for repairs, and before the great
work is finished it will be necessary to start
borrowing to build them all over again, because
old age and decrepitude will have come upon
them ; and so on ad infinitum. Consequently,
The Bulletin suggests that the present is as
good a time as any to stop short and think seri-
ously over the whole matter. Any time in the
last ten years, or even in the last 40 years,
would have done as well ; but those times
are past and the present one is still with us.
What this paper suggests is a short Act of
Parliament defining how far the present
system is to go ; and stating exactly whether
it is to stop at forest-thinning or go on to
include the destitute aboriginal’s blanket and
the clothes of the old man in the Benevolent
Asylum as well as the building he lives in ; and
explaining how the crumbling wooden wharf,
and the river that is dredged to-day and silted
up again to-morrow, come to be described as
permanent works ; and otherwise putting the
matter on a definite basis. It isn’t at all neces-
sary for Parliament to stop the present system
if it doesn’t feel so inclined, but it might as
well define the system, if only in order that it
can’t profess afterwards not to have known
what was going on.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Liquor Anomaly.
According to Victorian law, any retailer found
vending liquor not up to the standard strength,
or falsely labelled, or otherwise unwholesome,
bogus or adulterated, is heavily fined —nomin-
ally in the interests of the national stomach.
It may be proved quite clearly that he couldn’t
have tampered with the liquor, and had no
chance of knowing what it was like, it being
bottled, corked and sealed in the original pack-
ages, and it may be perfectly clear that he
didn't tamper with it—but the law holds him
responsible none the less because it was in his
possession. The other day a Melbourne publi-
can suspected that some liquor he had bought
was not what it professed to be, and called in
an excise officer to inspect it. The inspection
proved it to be a nauseous and adulterated
compound, and the retail groggist, as the result
of his own conscientiousness, was heavily fined
for having bad whisky on his premises. In his
defence he pleaded that he didn’t adulterate the
liquor, which seemed more than probable seeing
that it was he who called attention to it and
caused its confiscation ; and that it was exactly
as the wholesaler supplied it to him ; but he
was fined none the less. The situation as
between the wholesale and retail grog-dealer in
Victoria is a quaint affair, and stands practi-
cally as follows : (1) The retail dealer gener-
ally runs a “tied” house, which means that he
has to get his supplies. from one particular
wholesaler who holds a mortgage over him—-
therefore that wholesaler may send him what-
ever rubbish he pleases ; (2) The police con-
stantly inspect the retailer’s liquor but not the
wholesale dealer’s, therefore it is always the
former who falls in ; (3) when the retail dealer
says that his bad liquor is just as he received it,
and the wholesale person denies the statement,
as he always does, the law always believes the
wholesale witness. The law requires the pub-
lican to absolutely prove his statement, and the
only way it can be proved is by searching the
wholesale man’s premises and finding the evi-
dence there in the shape of the bad liquor
itself ; and the police never overhaul the big
man’s premises as they do the retailer’s, or pay
him surprise visits, or keep an effective eye on
him in any way. Therefore, while the law in-
sists that the retailer shall prove his statements
it, at the same time, takes all manner of care
that, he shall not be able to prove them. (4)
The law regards the wholesale dealer and the
retailer from entirely different standpoints.
If two moderately-reputable witnesses produce
a sample of bad liquor and swear that they
bought it from a certain publican, it is ten to
one that he is fined regardless of his denials ;
whereas The Bulletin never heard of a whole-
sale dealer being fined, no matter what the evi-
dence might be, so long as he simply denied the
charge. The law’s reverence for and confidence
in the wholesale grog-merchant is a strange
and wonderful emotion. :(5) The law which
does these remarkable things was created and
is maintained by a Parliament in which large,
affluent wholesale grog-dealers are numerous
and retailers are almost, if not entirely, absent.
Therefore, Victorian legal practice is based on
the great axiom that the wdiolesale grog-dealer
can do no wrong.
The Celtic Myth.
Dear Bulletin, —In between the war-whoops
of the indignant Caledonians, who will, doubt-
less, ere this have started out for your Philo-
Celtic correspondent’s scalp, let me, who am
neither Scotch nor “ scotty,” inquire of that
gentle commentator where, amongst British
poets, the Celt has “ let his soul go forth into
the night ” to any overpowering extent. Take
the six greatest names for imagination and
emotion. Shakespeare, Wordsworth, and
Keats are Saxon ; Milton, Shelley, and
Gordon (Byron) are Norman —as are Chaucer,
Spenser, and Tennyson ; while Dryden, Pope,.
and Gray, again, are Saxon. The Celt, we
are always being told—principally by him-
self—is poetically of the first heroic water,,
when he isn’t of the finest anacreontic. For
the first, I am assured—likewise mostly by
himself—that in his various original vernaculars
he was herein unsurpassed and unsurpassable.
A poor dozen of centuries ago, this, and I seek
not to dispel the enchantment attendant as
much upon durational distance as upon physical.
But —bar the ingenious manufacturer of the
supposed Ossianic dithyrambs —upon what
modern Celt has descended any appreciable
corner of this semi-mythic mantle of heroic
poesy? Where, too, be the Celts’ anacreontics?
Dependent for a collective reputation upon the
tin-pot tinklings of little Tommy Moore !
Alas, poor Celt ! Great may be the Burns
myth, but greater is the Celtic! — Cold Water.
Tlie Dean Curse.
“Dead, Fred. Curnow, secretary to the Dean -
Commission.” This is the fortunate young man
whom the other day all his fellow-scribes were
envying for his good luck in being son of editor
Curnow, of S.M. Herald, and near relation
of Mr. Brunker, N.S.W. Chief Secretary,
and in getting “ more than the Chief Justice’s,
salary ” in fees as attache to various Govt.
Commissions, whereof that on the Dean case
came last. The matter of Mr. Curnow’s
fees, indeed, caused quite a public scandal,
though Curnow, of course, only took what
he was permitted to take, and what his-
envious trade-rivals would gladly have taken
themselves had they got the chance. And now
Curnow is dead —dead of a fly-bite, a nothing—
a cold which he caught a fortnight ago. Elwell,
his highly-fee’d coadjutor in the business of
“ taking down ” the history of the Deans, is
already underground. It gives pause to the
Man in the Street. “ The Dean curse again !
where is It going to stop ? ” The Dean curse
will never stop. The Dean curse will go on to
eternity, as long as there is a single human
being left to work upon. For the Dean curse
is just one letter of one page of one volume of
the infinite edition of curses which afflict
humanity. The Dean curse ! —why, it
isn’t an iota, it isn’t a fragment, it is hardly
a grain of dust on the whiskers of the
one great Curse that sums up all the other
curses—the Curse of Existence. W e only see
the Dean curse at all by dint of concentrating
public attention upon it: the Man-in-the-Street.

Item from ex-Treasurer M‘Millan’s blasting
indictment of Premier Reid’s Budget and
alleged surplus :
In the year 1889 Mr. M ‘Mill an- expended £182,210 more
than he got: in the year 1890 there was a cash deficiency
of £51,266, and in the year 1891 there was a deficiency of
£331,450. Now he came to the two years when Mr. See
held office, and here he thought that Mr. Reid would have
done better had he been perfectly fair and candid. It did
not matter whether a Government were Protectionist or
Freetrade if they were honest and economical. I he posi-
tion of accounts in 1892 was this : The cash deficiency was
£35,716, the lowest cash deficiency up to this time. Next
year (1893), however, the deficiency was £582,288, and m
the year 1894, during half of which Mr. Reid was in office,
the deficiency was £29,242. In the first six months of
1895 Mr. Reid had a cash deficiency of £366,028, this being
at the rate of £720,000 a year. In the financial year 1895-
96, and it did not matter whether they covered it up
with Treasury bills or anything else as the country would
have to pay the piper, there was a cash deficiency of
£634,169 for the 12 months. There could be no dispute
about these figures, and it did not matter what had been
done with Treasury bills. During his own Treasurership
the aggregate deficiency was £564,926 between expendi-
ture and money received. The average annual deficiency
of his administration was £180,308. Then the aggregate
for Mr. See’s two and a half years was £796,076, or an
average per annum of £318,430. The deficiency on the
part of Mr. Reid's Administration for the two years was
£851,483, or an average of £425,000.
A Cheeky Minority.
The Maoriland Bible-in-schools party made its
usual regular appearance this session, and its
bill was thrown out by 43 votes against 11.
The one thing on which these provinces appear
to be solid all round is that they don’t want to
mix up Scripture and education, or to introduce
parsonical influence into the schools in any
form whatever. Yet though the Scriptural
party is utterly licked wherever it goes to a
vote, it keeps on asserting, with a gall that
passeth all understanding, that the great mass
of the people are really with it. In S.A., after
being hopelessly extinguished on many occa-
sions in the Legislature, it persistently alleged
that all it wanted was a straight vote of the
whole people, and when it got this it would
wipe its opponents off the face of the earth.
At last election it got the referendum it had
bowled for so long and agonisingly. Three
questions were submitted: (1) “Are you in
favor of maintaining the present secular
system ? ” on which the Bible-party was
■defeated by 51,000 votes against 17,000 ;
i(2) “ Are you in favor of Scriptural in-
struction in schools?” where the Scripture-
party was licked by 34,000 votes against 19,000;
and (3) “ Are you in favor of State assistance
to denominational schools?” on which point the
pious party went down by 42,000 votes against
13,000. The majority was so tremendous on
■every point that for a few weeks the Scripture
■crowd kept silence and didn’t even attempt to
■explain things away—in fact, it seemed as if no
■one could explain away such majorities as these.
But now it has got its second wind, and once
more a voice like a deacon crying in the wilder-
ness asserts that the mass of the people wants
the Bible-in-schools system, and wants it badly,
and that the referendum was all a mistake.
Most of the voters answered only the first ques-
tion on the voting-paper, because it really
■covered everything ; and some answered the
■second and third only. So a section of the
Scriptural party now rises on two argumentative
legs to assert that the people who didn’t vote on
■any one or two questions were necessarily
favorable to the church crowd on these ques-
tions, and if they were all added together, as
they ought to he, and credited to the church,
as they should be, it would have a big majority.
On this principle, if one man voted straight for
a continuance of the present system, and left
the other two questions unanswered because
the first one really covered the whole ground,
be would count as one vole for the cause lie
voted for and two votes for the cause he voted
against. A party which wants to count the
ballots this way is a very hard case to deal
with, and can fairly claim to be the cheekiest
little minority in this continent.
Ed. Bulletin,— The sooner Premier Reid, and
the parties who superintend the relief to the
■destitute, think out some means of doing away
with the hideous spectacle to be seen on Thurs-
days at Sydney Benevolent Asylum, when
■Society throws its scraps to those who are
whipped up by necessity to the place of degrada-
tion”, the better for all concerned. It would be
kinder to the great majority of the pensioners
! xo quietly shoot them than continue the present
■caricature of benevolence. To serve out
| groceries, clothes, and donations towards the
rent is a gigantic blunder, for toilers are easily
converted into paupers, and the present relie
system must inevitably reduce its victims to a
state similar to that of the emancipated W est
Indian negroes. The object of all relief organi-
sations, private or national, should he to put tne
recipient of their aid in a position to maintain
himself and family; the Government should
classify the unemployed and put those who can
and will work on to reproductive works till they
can earn enough to make a fresh start in hie
the remainder, who cannot and will not woi
should be provided for in asylums and gaols.
Work, hospital or gaol : those are the three
sound alternatives. Last Thursday the wnter
made enquiries among a large number of men
waiting at the so-called Benevolent Asylum,
and numbers of them admitted they had been
receiving State aid for two, three and four
years. When a man has been living on State
charity for four or even two years it proves
that either the man is useless or the State is an
economic imbecile. To a man and wife of the
unemployed section the State-subsidised society
issues weekly 4 loaves, 21b. flour, 21b. meat, 4 lb.
tea, and lib. of coarse brown sugar, and, when
found necessary, blankets and boots. 11ns is
continued week after week till the man
obtains work, commits suicide, or the wife
becomes immoral, when the relief is stoppei .
Judging from the remarks and conversation ol
the crowd, a number of the wives do beconu
immoral, and until New South Wales realises
that its present alleged benevolent system of
relief is wrong in theory and unutterably woise
in practice, the wives will go on getting moie
and more immoral, and the men more and more
useless, and the unemployed larger and larger
till the community will either fall to pieces or
do something rash.—Z.
N.S.W. Opposition-leader Lyne is reported a,B
saying, in a recent speech at Windsor, that il
he came into power he “ did not say he would
retain the land and income tax.” Presumably
this means that he wouldn’t retain it, and, if
so, Lyne’s usual big mistake sticks out con-
spicuously. When will some influential politi-
cian arise who will tell the country the naked
truth about its position ? Said truth is that
Protection isn’t a means of creating revenue
(except incidentally and in its earlier stages),
but a means of creating wealth and building up
industries and furnishing employment. Also,
that the ordinary expenditure of N.S. Wales,
even on a very cheap basis, is about <£10,500,000
a year, but £1,000,000 to £1,500,000 of
it is surreptitiously charged to loans to
create a bogus aspect of economy ; and to meet
this the Treasury wants all the Land and
Income tax it has,' and possibly more, and all it
can get incidentally from a Protective tariff as
well. Further, that if tne Government raised
£1,500,000 a year more taxation than it does,
and spent it on profitable works, it would do
vastly more to relieve distress than by borrow-
ing or by stopping public works to keep down
the figures of the budget. The wail every where
is that distress is caused by gold lying idle in
banks instead of being employed in useful
undertakings. AGovernment which had courage
enough to annex a lot of that unemployed gold
and start useful undertakings with it, and to
tell the people that what they u anted was more
taxation, provided the money was profitably
employed, instead of less, would be a blessing
to this land of the Fool’s Paradise.
One day lately four men plea led guilty to
travelling on N.S.W. railway lines without
tickets. On the same day a woman at Newtown
pleaded guilty to sending her boy to steal coal
from the State-railway shed. In each case the
accused indicated that they thought it a less
crime to steal public property than private.
This represents the percolation through the
body civil of the ages-old politician brand of
morality. The politician scorns to help himself
or his family out of Tom Smith’s grocery or
Bill Jones’ calico emporium, but he puts his
sister-in-law in a £2OO a year Government
billet or thrusts a sap-headed son into the door-
way of some State Department, and helps the
boy to spend the produce on board and lodging
in the house of dad.
Charles Dangar, a Surry Hills illicit whisky-
maker, was fined £5OO the other day in a
Sydney Court. The alternative punishment
was a year’s gaol. Just think of the illicit
whisky-maker of the present time paying a fine
of £5OO ! And, if he had the £5OO, the Court
is certainly not going to get it. I irst, there is
no big man now in the nefarious trade; or, if
there be, he only lends a trifle of cash at mas-
sive interest, and is able to absolutely defy the
law. The men now running stills about Sydney
are but little above the unemployed level, so
far as wealth is concerned. They are robbed
at everv point. They must, bribe at every
point. And when they are caught they are just
as poor as when they started. And £5OO or a
year in gaol! If the law made it £5O or two
years, most of those captured would have to
take the two years.
The N.S.W. kindergarten movement, so long
as it is under the patronage of fashionables
and faddists, promises to become another ex-
crescence on the education-system of thecountrj.
Froebel’s idea is to teach by play ; but play is
healthy and invigorating only when it is free and
spontaneous, and the kindergarten, “bossed”
by any broken-down governess who can do the
requisite amount of mechanical stuffing with
the “groups” of toys, will but add another
horror to child-life in our great cities. The
kindergarten has a distinct psychological value,
and every modern teacher worthy of the name
apprehends that his methods must be rooted
firmly in psychological laws —but it is pe-
culiarly a system that requires for its
sound application the genius of the born
teacher—precisely the quality a committee of
fashionable faddists cannot detect. When,
the other day, Gov. Hampden told a Sydney
audience he knew little about Froebel’s
system, he possibly suggested to the pro-
moters of he gathering that w.th such an
aristocratic example of nescience before them
they could well afford to be equally candid.

lations of Melb. Secular Society. How these
Secularists love one another !
Heaton on Parkes.
The most awful obituary reference to Parbes
was that published in London by Henniker
Heaton. Such greatness as the old man had
has heen pretty well discounted by the fulsome
falsehoods of his “ friends,” but the meanest of
all tributes have sprung (as in the nature of the
case was to be expected) from those who bat-
tened parasitically on his fame. Listen to
Heaton or his “ ghost ” :
He (Parkes) adhered rigidly to his own standard of
right and wrong, and no earthly inducement could draw
hnn an inch to the right or left from it.
Parses, in later years, developed too essenti-
ally a feminine nature to have moral criteria.
Up to the moment of the Empire cataclysm,
the man’s virility had, at least, equal play to
his femininity ; after that event, the other side
of him took control. His inordinate vanity,
his craving for a retinue of women and for the
perpetual incense of her-parasites among men,
his incapacity to be just before being generous,
his subservience to the impulse of the moment,
his impatience of detail, his love of the orotund,
were all feminine characteristics, and in them-
selves symptomatic of the repugnance of the
feminine order of mind to create moral stan-
dards for itself. Like Coleridge, Parkes had
“no morals.”
The surest way to prevent him from granting a public
favor was to do him a private favor.
An absolutely indisputable utterance —if
Parkes’s 1.0. U. Ministries, Executive Comis-
sioners’ appointments, and fifty other co-
ordinate facts can be blown out of existence by
Heaton’s perfumed breath.
He had no vices; he neither smoked, nor drank, nor
gambled ; he hated idleness; his whole time was so
sacredly devoted to the public service that he hesitated
even to speak with persons unknown to him, his theory
being that it was sheer waste of time to converse with
nine men out of ten.
The verbal statement of this “ theory.” Parkes
prigged from a Palmerstonian remark, and
in his practice he set it at defiance daily.
No public man, in or out of office, was more
easily accessible to the idling stranger and
friendly loafer who come to flatter. His time
was perpetually occupied, it is true ; but it was
usually with the business of a fribble. No man
had a finer faculty of deceiving himself with
the notion that the trifles that engaged his
attention were important. He always remained
a toy-maker—and played with his toys when
he should have been working. Heaton, pace
ghost, again :
“ I remember his paying away all the little money he
could command for a holographic letter of Oliver Crom-
well’s which I had discovered.”
The generosity which prompts the reminiscence
might well have been taxed to save the old
man’s “ little money ” by a donation of the pre-
cious holograph “discovered” —in the nearest
bookseller’s —by Mr. Henniker Heaton.
“ Sir Henry’s utterances were to ordinary ears dis-
figured by a careless use of the aspirate.”
“ A superior critic this, my Lord ! ” But what
of “ extraordinary ears ” such as doubtless con-
stitute “ the aural appendages ” —sweet Even-
ing News phrase, this !—of Heaton’s “ghost”?
“We all remember the immortal phrase in which he
expressed the Imperial idea —‘ the crimson thread of
kinship’—that ran throughout the Empire.”
Mr. Heaton’s “ghost’s” grammar is shaky
somewhat. What ran throughout the Empire
—the phrase, the idea, or the “crimson thread”?
Anyhow, the phrase wasn’t Parkes’. But,
for the Heatonian finale :
I am aware that he has been heavily censured, almost
ostracised, for marrying . . . Without entering into
the abstract questions of morality involved, I would
merely observe that in this, as in every other action, he
followed the dictates of a singularly uncompromising
conscience.
The Bulletin does not know which to admire
most: the humor or the good taste of Mr.
Heaton’s “ ghost.” In the latter quality he
can boast close comparison with the Sydney
daily which, on the morning succeeding Parkes’
death, gave the date of his second marriage,
and, immediately below this intelligence, the
ages of the children of the second Lady Parkes.
“ A singularly uncompromising conscience.”

The present marvellously-successful Syd-
ney Lyceum show ceases from troubling after
baturday night, and for nearly a week
the theatre will be deserted. On the ensu-
es Saturday (August 15) Mrs. Potter and
Ayrle Bellew appear in “La Tosca,” with the
lovely Cora as the heroine, and Kyrle in the
dark and shuddersome character of Baron Scarpia.
Ihe Bulletin has hopes that the interval will be
made use of to clean the wall-paper up aloft,
where the grease-mark of the heads of many gods
is painfully conspicuous.

Bland Holt left Sydney Royal on Monday
night, and Maggie Moore was announced to open
her irilby burlesque season on Wednesday,
inis memorable event was unfortunately too late
tor notice in the present issue, and the outpouring
iHE ,'’ ulleti n’s great soul on the subject of
Maggie Moore and her feet and her other attrac-
tions is necessarily held over till next week.

Rev. Charles Clark is doing his last series
of lectures at Sydney Centenary Hall, and a few
stray cycloramas and other trifles are filling in the
great void to the best of their ability. Meanwhile,
Her Majesty s and the Criterion keep shut with
an energy that is worthy of a better cause, and
two or three ancient places of amusement which
nave been closed for ages have suddenly remained
that way with great success.

The Frantz Family is still engaged making
a lean and much afflicted city sit up in wonder-
ment Also Provo, the amazing juggler, has re-
turned. When one considers Provo in all his
glory, and how he can bring something out of
nothing, and rest things on top of things that
aren t there, and make large articles go away of
their own accord, and make impossible things
happen and make other things impossibly stop
happening, and how he can make circumstances
he going to occur last year and cause them to have
occurred next week, this paper really begins to
understand all about the financial statement for
the first time. And when Provo explains how
these things are done in a way that makes them
more obscure than ever, The Bulletin gets the
uu n s- J of M Malian's comments on Reid in a way
that it never did before.

That most deserving charity, the Civil
Ambulance and Transport Brigade of N.SW
(which is prepared to be rung up at any hour of
the day or night to convey accident or other
sudden cases to the hospital gratis, with care and
the most approved appliances) is to have a benefit
at bydney Opera House on Monday, 10th August.
Ihe performance is by the members of the Govt.
Printing Office Dramatic and Musical Associa-
r! 01 !’ anc * If under the most influential patronage
that the city can provide. Considering the merits
or the Ambulance Association, which does more
good with less frill and brass trumpet than the
majority of charities, The Bulletin trusts that
all bydney will roll up unanimously.

The cinematographe ”is an evolution of
Mr. Edison’s “ kinetoscope,” by M. Lumiere, of
.Lyons, the celebrated inventor of the “ dry plate.”
A series of photographs are taken so raoidly that
they practically represent every movement of the
living or moving objects before the lens, as the
human eye cannot distinguish an action which re-
quires less than a tenth of a second to complete
its motion. In each picture there are 900 nega-
tives and the same machine that takes them serves
to lenect them (nearly life-size) on a screen. A
cinematographe for Sydney is aboard the incoming
Uroya, and a second machine is to follow. The
introducer is confident of a boom.

nt “ l, n Mizzoura,” the second attempt of the
Nat Goodwin Co. at Melb. Princess’, is a calm
pine-log drama of domestic life way out West or
bouth- West, where everybody, bar an occasional
accident, is real grit for dead sartin, and the
noblest man m the crowd always spits with the
greatest deliberation. Australia got an agreeable
taste of In Mizzoura ” from “ The Countv Fair ”
an importation of some few years ago, which was
brought into disrepute by an absurd mechanical
horse-race. There is nothing ridiculous about the
present drama. It relates to human existence in
a blacksmith s cottage, and derives its simple
interest from real 'Murkan dialect and ap-
propriate surroundings. It is a drama of
magnificent distances, or pauses, between
laconic remarks apropos to siiiall dailv events
aT ? c ! humble aspirations. It is a drama in
which the entire cast might be expected to collapse
at the news that the taters were overboiled Most
of the characters carry real grit on their faces as
well as inside ’em ; the one clean, town-made in-
terloper is an oasis of scoundrelism in a desert of
native simplicity, and the only woman who finds
the grimy social atmosphere oppressive is a poor
young victim to boarding-school education. This
superior Kate takes kindly to the evil interloper
because he doesn’t chew terbacker- or wear big
feet, and a laconic Jim (the prototype of his Aus
tralian namesake) shows his silent love for the girl
by lending her dude a horse wherein to flee from
justice.
.** * *
Jim is a self-sacrificer, possessed of a
genius for saying little at a slow pace, or leaning
silently against his thoughts. Nat Goodwin im-
personates Jim for all he is worth. It is a part to
be walked through, with folded arms and a ’Mur-
kan drawl, in the manner of -ToeJefferson, and the
star doubtless shines as much as any actor could
shine in such a character. The bulk of his fine
manly feeling is left entirely to the imagination.
He travels on an unruffled demeanor like our old
friend Sass, who in evening-dress was as true to
life m the West of London as Jim is true to life in
the Western States. But this is not acting to
gush over. The parts, mostly amusing, of Bill,
Sam, Dave, ’Lizbeth, and the inevitable colonel
are also naturally represented. The fact that all
these restful rustics talk the same dialect in a
stereotyped tone has a certain monotonous
charm, very acceptable for a change, though
not calculated to grow upon urban audiences.
Jo, the blacksmith, appears rather unnatu-
rally monotonous, but Miss Mortimer, as his
wife, gives a brisk motherly performance. Miss
Blanche Walsh, who was sweetly subdued in “ A
Gilded Fool,” is now sweetly melodramatic in the
Kate character, her impassioned raising of a storm
in the cottage tea-cup being, perhaps, intended to
warn blacksmiths against educating their eldest
daughters. “In Mizzoura ” is billed to glorify
Jim for one week only. On Saturday (Bth) Nat
Goodwin will produce further proof of his versa-
tility in “The Rivals,” one of the most un-
American comedies ever written.
** * *
The next special feature at the Opera House
will be Carl Hertz, who takes the place of Charles
Godfrey and brings some new illusions that are
said to be even more ingenious than his first lot.
Hertz starts on Saturday. Likewise the Bijou
will open again on Saturday, this time under the
management of Cosgrove minus Marie Luella, with
A Trip to Chicago.”

“ Cheer Boys Cheer,” the novelty unloosed
by George Rignold at Melb. Royal, is a stupen-
dous entertainment, in five massive acts. The last
massive act didn’t begin until 11.30 p.m. on Satur-
day, and when The Bulletin chronicler tore him-
self away to catch a midnight train, it was from a
scene of gilded splendor, wherein a tall flunkey
stood announcing members of Hingland’s alleged
aristocracy as they came to hand. A sassiety
denouement seemed likely to happen soon, but the'
railway time-table was inexorably fixed. Thirty-
seven people, mostly of proud lineage, figure on
the programme, and, in addition to these,
there are two small detachments of British troops
and a band of very black Matabele braves who
make a record by overwhelming George Rignold
half-an-hour before closing-time. George falls
mortally wounded whilst singing “ God Save the
CJueen, the death of that hitherto-invincible hero
being the chief surprise in the show. He expires
upon a heap of slain after an informal marriage
with the girl he had misjudged, the band playing
Chopins Marche Funebre.as a guarantee of
burial to come. Manager Rignold and his drama
moved too slowly on Saturday night, yet, con-
sidering the vast dimensions of the undertaking,
the first performance was a successful trial.
* * * *
Cheer Boys Cheer ” has humor and
satire m its various comedy sketches, as well as a
reasonable plot. The polished villain is a cheerful
schemer, and his clerk—an amateur demagogue
who waves a red signal for the masses to revolt—
seems bound to become popular. A designing
lady s-maid contributes a few jokes; also, numer-
ous other people say, or do, things that bear upon
the awfulness of modern civilisation and leave an .
impression by the way. In fact, the drama,
although overloaded with spectacular effects and
unnecessary expenses, has claims to be called a
playu In the matter of all-round opportunities for
smart acting “Cheer Boys Cheer” stands alone
among shows built specially for Drury Lane
Iheatre.
* * * *
The company engaged by G.R. ranges
from very good to middling and worse. Miss
Lmily Hughes, fresh from ’Ome, is an attractive
little lady, who bears herself daintily under diffi-
cult circumstances in the bad young man’s private
sitting-room, and acts with pretty vocal and facial
expression throughout the trouble. Her best
points would be more telling in a smaller house
than the Royal, nevertheless she took her place
there with capital results. Plimmer, as the
abnormally cool villain, is another bright spot,
and Haiis Phillips plays the clerk well enough
. ™ake himself a favorite. Miss Watts-
I lumps turns the lady’s-maid character to fair
account; Sweeney repeats his previous caricature
ot the greasy Hebrew that is said to libel an
ancient race ; and Miss Maud Williamson scores in
a light, u indefinable capacity. Stirling White and
Miss Leigh, as a pair of sinful pietists, are mild
artistic failures in comparison with J. G. Patten
who meets his liabilities to the extent of about
twopence in the £. A dozen minor performers
can scramble for half-a-dozen words of negative
praise and the same number of unpleasant remarks.
John Brunton has painted an abundance of fine
scenery for “Cheer Boys Cheer,” but the stage-
management on the first night was not up to Rig-
nold s standard. The show should improve rapidlv
and prosper.

Mdlle. Trebelli gives the second concert of
her return season at Melbourne Town Hall to-
night, by which time a drowsy public will, no
doubt, have become aware that this first-class
a-rtist is back again. Another cause for excite-
ment in musical circles is the advent of the Musins
who are to appear with pianist Scharf at the
Athenaeum Hall on Saturday, after an absence of
tour long years.

The Trilby Co. flashed through Tasmania
last week, and the populace fought for seats on
tdm understand l rig that there was more of the
altogether m the play than is really the case,
lassies are as keen on this sort of thing as their
more wide-awake neighbours—which is as credit-
able as it is human. Their disappointment is
keener, if anything. At Launceston the weather
spoilt the effect of Svengali’s death-scene. It was
a frosty night, and the spectacle of a dead man’s
vaporised breath shooting upwards like steam
from the funnel of a locomotive wasn’t a bit real-
istic. To intensify the trouble, another mummer
in a black coat stood directly behind the ascending
columns of Fax’s condensed soul, thus making a
background for the aggravation. As a compen-
3(ating advantage it is only fair to say that a
lydy ” in the stalls exclaimed “My goodness,
he s burning already ! ”
* * * *■
Dr. Neild, who presented Maggie Moore
with her purse of sovs. and complimentary address
the other night, is the best of showmen for a little
job like that. At one fell swoop he knocked 22
years off the heroine’s age by calling her Maggie
m brisk, fatherly style, and referring to her Aus-
tralian debut as quite a recent event in his memory.
“Maggie” seemed to be back again in the old
times as the doctor talked, and her unaffected
returning of thanks, coming between the doctor’s
speech and a few more remarks by George Coppin,
was about the most youthful performance she has
accomplished on the boards of Melbourne Roval.
** # *
A very poor house on the second night of
“ A Gilded Fool ” alarmed Nat. Goodwin unduly.
Announcements that his opening piece would run
a fortnight, with a matinee thrown in, were im-
mediately modified. ’ “A Gilded Fool” would
have to be withdrawn at the end of the week in
consequence, &c., &c., and the matinee idea was
dropped overboard. Then the general public
started rolling up quietly to take a “liker” at
Nathaniel and his new show from America, and
when the sixth night’s takings came to hand the
management felt sorry for having so hastily aban-
doned the original plan of procedure. Business
had been on the up-grade since the second occasion,
which is notoriously an unsafe “test night ’ to go
upon. The Firm had a really astonishing re-
minder of this fact with “Gentleman Joe” last
year, when the second night’s receipts were
doubled, or thereabouts, on the Tuesday.

The very “ Berritish ” Melb. Age slated
Miss Ethel Browning, in “A Gilded Fool,” be-
cause of her Americanisms and her Yankee twang.
Goodwin, the low comedian, and Miss Browning
playing a vivacious young Yank, are the only two
who indulge in dialect, and the paper, which
quotes Pinero as an ideal, piles on its dignity and
whoops for orthoepical purity. Yet if a British
playwright uses a Yorkshireman, or a Lanky, or
a Cockney, with his hideous dialect thick upon
him, who would object and accuse the actor and
the author of diabolically defiling the pure well of
English ? The American dialect is ali ving thing,
it is of the people, and stripped of their twang
and their peculiar idioms these men and women
would not receive adequate representation at the
hands of an actor or an actress. In “A Gilded
Fool ” Miss Browning and Goodwin handle char-
ters who would probably talk dialect. Most
edifying it is to hear two-thirds of John Bull
abusing the American for his dialect in a language
that is mere gibberish to the majority of the Eng-
lish-speaking peoples. The mote in the other
fellow s mouth and the beam in his own.

effective of all the Svengalis that have mesmerised Trilby

Miss > Eleanor Chapman, the contralto soloist at Dr.

uncommon as Miss Nagel’s.
Melbourne Age is putting up a record for “ lovalty ” in
all departments of journalism. Speaking of an oratorio
performance by the local Philharmonic Society, at which
ms local Ex. was present, the critic sorrowfully ob-
serves : The effort of organising three big shows in four
nights was too ambitious ; and it is unlucky that all the
most serious shortcomings should have been kept in
reserve.for Lord Brassey’s benefit.” The first duty of any
musical crowd is, seemingly, to shine before Lord Brassey.
People who saw “Trilby ” performed, both in Melbourne
and Sydney, attribute its comparative failure in the older
city to the shape of the Lyceum Theatre. The show was
« more effective at the Princess’, where the sentiment
of the story seemed to get a better grip upon the audience.
If Rignold’s new leading lady, Miss Emily Hughes, were
an inch or two taller she would be the most effective
melodramatic heroine that Australia has welcomed since
Kate Bishop came along.

The N.B.W. Budget compares rather badly with
that of Victoria, despite the outward appearance of
things. Reid had a surplus of ±330,000 ; Turner a net
deficiency estimated at fully ±60,000. On the other hand,
N.S.W. spent something like ±2,000,000 of loan-moneys,
and somewhere about half of this was for unproductive
works which ought fairly to have heen charged to revenue ;
Victoria spent ±219,000 of loan-moneys, and all of it was
on reproductive works. The N.S. VV. public-debt increased,
so far as appears at present, rather over ±1,500,000, and,
despite savings by conversions, the interest increases by
£15,000 ; the Victorian debt diminished ±303,000— though
against this there is an increase in the deficit, which is
charged temporarily against the trust funds—and the
interest payment is reduced by £12,000. Reid estimates
his next year’s deficit at ,£125,000 ; Turner anticipates a
shortage of ±79,000. Altogether, on close inspection,
most of the points seem to be in Turner’s favor.
* * * *
The =£25,000 spent last year in sand-shifting
relief works, at Sydney Centennial Park, wasn’t charged
to revenue. It was temporarily borrowed out of the trust
funds ; and matters were squared by writing up the value
of the Government property at the park by ±25,000,
making the paper-value ±224,371 !! t Another item in
the beautiful surplus. Such book-keeping would make a
cat laugh.
* * * *
Treasurer Nelson, of Queensland, reports a sur-
plus for the year of ±73,636, and, according to the Act
passed last year, this amount has to be handed over to the
trustees for the reduction of the public-debt. The beauty
and advantage of this system is that the alleged surplus
has to be produced in actual cash, and, as it goes out of
the Treasurer’s hands, he isn’t tempted by its existence
to go on the burst next year. There was a time when
N.S.W. had an accumulated surplus of ±3,889,000, but, as
it wasn’t put out of the Treasurer’s reach on the wise
principle established by Nelson, it was gradually eaten up
by Governments which wanted to reduce taxation in order
that they might whoop about it at next election, and
thereby secure votes.
* * * *
Premier Seddon estimates the Maoriland surplus
for next year at £31,835. As this isn’t nearly enough to
keep the Public Works Department going—it wants about
±600,000 a year—there must be more taxation or else a
loan. And as Seddon hasn’t the pluck to face the taxa-
tion there is going to be a loan. What is wanted is a
separate tax, estimated to produce £600,000 a year, which
shall be paid into a separate Public Works fund so that it
can’t be used for ordinary expenditure purposes. The
Works Department shouldn’t be dependent either on the
precarious surplus or on the miserable borrowing ex-
pedient.
• • * •
The A. J.S. Bank directors have wisely decided
to pay no dividend this half-year. The profits are ±20,629
(equal to a little over per cent, per annum) as com-
pared to the four previous half-years’ returns of £25,825,
±24,932, £21,914, and £32,083. During the last two years
the A. J.S. has reduced its reconstructed deposits by some-
where between £1,000,000 and £1,500,000 —the exact
amount can’t be ascertained because the sheet mixes up
the long-dated deposits due 1907 and the new deposits—
which means a large saving of interest; it has also effected
a reduction of interest on some of the converted deposits,
and in addition it has increased its capital by over ±120,000.
And, despite all this, the net earnings have declined over
±ll,OOO as compared with the corresponding half of ’94.
Whether the much-reduced profit of £20,629 has been
earned in the ordinary course of business or not is uncer-
tain, but one circumstance seems to suggest that it has
not. For some years past “ British Consols £240,600 ”
has been an item in the balance-sheet. It appeared there
when Consols stood at par, and, as the figures never
altered, it is evident the bank did not take credit for the
greatly increased value of the security. This half-year it
disappears, so evidently the securities are sold, and as the
increased value realised, which represents fully £21,000,
doesn’t appear anywhere else, Thk Bulletin assumes that
it is included in the profit. If this is so, it accounts for
all the profit, and the ordinary business would seem to
have yielded nothing at all. And, again, if this is so, the
outlook for next half-year, if things don’t improve mean-
while, is very unpromising.
The A.J.S. adds =B2OOO to reserve, making it
£52,000, and (including the balance from last half-year)
has ±21,264 to carry' forward. The reserve, so far as
appears, isn’t specifically invested in Government securi-
ties or otherwise set aside, but seems to be mixed up in
the general business. The cash (£804,662) is £230,000 less
than it was six months ago, and the total of cash and
liquid securities is £1,316,628, or £546,000 less. The re-
payment of £500,000 of fixed deposits accounts for most
of this, and the remainder of the decline is apparently
part of the general badness of things. During the
six months the reserve-fund of the old bank has declined
by £199,000, which apparently means that that amount
has gone to wipe off bad debts and depreciation in the
old assets. The old bank’s reserve has diminished in two
years from £738,164 to £374,212, so it has been vanishing
much faster last half than it did before. Whether the
remainder of the reserve is sufficient to cover all losses
and depreciation not yet provided for is a point which
remains to be settled. As compared with last half-year
the note circulation shows a decline of £25,000 ; current
accounts have dropped by £91,000 ; and taken all round
the A. J.S. looks less promising in almost every direction.
• * * *
The Queensland National Bank also stops pay-
ment of its dividend this half-year, and announces that it
will have to join in the reconstruction movement. It
wants a reduction of deposit-interest, and also more time
for repayment. The half-year’s profits are £10,021, against
£13,130 for the previous six months —equal to about 2J
per cent, per annum on capital. There is very little in-
formation in the Q.N.B.’s sheet. Deposits have appa-
rently declined £600,000 during the half-year ; but, as all
manner of deposits are lumped together, it is impossible
to say whether the reduction is caused by a great ske-
daddle among the currtnt-account holders, or among the
new fixed depositors, or through the partial repayment
of reconstructed deposits, or through acceptance of re-
constructed deposits in payment of debts, or through
reduction in Government deposits, or whether there have
been £1,000,000 or more of private deposits withdrawn
and the reduction has been partly counteracted by an
increase of Government deposits, or what has happened.
At all events, nothing has been heard about the Q.N.
Bank paying off any of its old deposits. The cash and
more or less liquid assets are set down at £2,132,043 —a
decline of £169,000 during the half-year ; and the fact
that, despite this apparently big reserve, nothing has
been said about releasing any part of the deposits looks
like a confession of weakness. The assets consist mostly
of “ bills receivable and all other debts due to the bank,
£7,763,781,” and there is nothing in this large, con-
gested item to throw any light on the real value of the
securities. In fact, the balance-sheet of the Q.N. Bank
contains as much obscurity as the worst of the banking
reports of Australia. The Q.N. Bank has no reserve-fund
now, its old reserve having vanished in ’93, and its capital
(£887,000) is about the weakest in Australia in proportion
to liabilities.
* * ♦ *
The Bank of North Queensland still goes on its
troubled way with moderate success. The half-year’s
profits are £1702, as compared with the last three half-
yearly records of £llB2, £1736, and £1674. There is
therefore a handsome improvement on the returns at 31st
December, ’95. Still the profit is less than 2 per cent, per
annum on capital. As usual, there is no dividend, but
the balance to the credit of profit and loss is now ±5648.
Dividends, with the 8.N.Q., seem still a very long way
off. Deposits (£231,619) show an increase of £40,000 dur-
ing the half-year. The coin-reserve is £57,709, and the
coin and liquid securities are ±87,747 —a large increase,
and equal to 31 per cent, on liabilities. The peculiar
strength of the B.N.Q. lies in the fact that, out of the
±390.000 Of advances, more than one-half is the share-
holders’ own capital, so that the assets could depreciate
aboqt 60 per cent, all round before there would be any
risk of loss to depositors or other outside creditors. In a
large bank it often happens that the shareholders’ capital
equals a much smaller proportion —in some cases it goes
as low as one-eighth—of the advances, and in these latter
instances a 20 per cent, depreciation in assets would eat
up the capital and make a very big hole in the deposits as
well.
About a year ago the B.N.Q. made a new
departure by taking 4£ per cent, deposits fixed for 10
years and repayable thereafter only at the option of the
bank. These now amount to £47,000. The idea evidently
was that though a bank could only, pay, say, 3 per cent,
on ordinary deposits, where a large portion of the money
had to be kept lying idle to meet repayments, it could
afford 4£ where there was no repayment save at the bank’s
convenience, and consequently all the money' could be
profitably invested. The scheme seems to have produced
no dreadful results so far, though 4| per cent, is a high
rate and 10 years a long term. A year ago the B.N.Q.
wrote off another £lO,OOO to cover depreciation, but
whether this finally wipes off all losses or not is unknown.
If the £389,598 of advances are all good, they only earn
£4 19s. percent, per annum gross interest, and there is
very little margin in taking deposits at £4 10s. and in-
vesting them at £4 19s. and paying working expenses out
of the difference. And if the average lending rate is, say,
6 per cent, it means that fully £60,000 of the investments
are yielding no return at all, and if even half of that
amount has gone bad it will take about nine years at the
present rate of profit-making to wipe off the shortage.
For these reasons the present writer would much rather
be a 41 per cent, depositor than a shareholder in the
B.N.Q.'
* * * *
Taking things all round, the first half of ’96 has
been a disastrous time for banks generally. The Commer-
cial of Australia earned 1 25,134 less than the previous
half-year; Bank of Victoria, 15563 less; City Bank of
Sydney, £l9ll less;, Ballarat Banking Co., £213 less;
A.J.S. Bank, £5196 less; Queensland National Bank,
£3109 less. Three small increases are the Royal of
Queensland, which earned £413 more, the Bank of
North Queensland £521 more, and the Commercial
of Sydney', £829 more than last half, but they
amount to very little amid the general decline. The
banks which issued their statements on 30th March
were also in the main an unfortunate-looking crowd.
The Colonial showed a serious slump—allowing for the
fact that it had got a large reduction of deposit interest ;
the National showed a decline of £3239; and the very
small improvements shown in the four boom-blasted pro-
vinces of the mainland were the Royal of Melbourne,
which was £6l better, and the Bank of Adelaide, which
improved by £177. In the face of all this general sinkage,
the stereotyped observation of the daily paper that the
balance-sheet was “most satisfactory” or “exhibited great
strength,” or “promised well for the future ” is a ghastly
mockery. The situation opens up a great field for con-
jecture as to the future. If any more big collapses took
place the result wouldn’t be a panic, for the country is too
tired and dispirited and soul-weary to rush for its money
as it did in ’93 ; but commercial Australia would simply
bur.v its head in the ashes, and turn its hinder part to the
cold blast of adversity', and want to give up the struggle.
* * * *
Queensland Mutual Insurance Co. shows a pre-
mium-income which is slightly', less than last y'ear’s, and a
profit for the year of £3351, against £4380 at June, 1895,
and £2901 in 1894. The usual 8 per cent, dividend ac-
counts for £1238, and the balance of £2113 is added to
profit-and-loss, making it £8246. Out of this, £4500 goes
to start a reserve-fund, which the Queensland Mutual
hasn’t yet possessed, the reserve to be invested in State
securities ; and £3746 is carried forward. The mam assets,
apart from £4950 of State securities, are baldly stated as
“ Investments, £9516,” and “ Mortgages, £3928.” Judging
by the interest received, which is nearly 4J4 P er cent, all
round, the securities seem to have escaped any serious de-
preciation, but “investments” doesn’t contain anything
like as much information as the shareholders should have.
Still, the Queensland Mutual seems a well-managed and
progressive office, and if it will keep clear of the big-
dividend craze until it has a reserve of £50,000 or so it
should have a good future before it. The yearning of
small new offices with hardly any reserves to pay 10 and
15 per cent, is one reason why the fire-insurance industry'
has run down so much in Australia.

The Vic. railways, for the year just closed,

Melbourne Tramway Co. made £26,581 profit
for the year just ended, as compared with £28,090 last

£24,728. Fitzgerald’s Brewery Co. (Castlemaine, Vic.)
pay's a dividend at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum.
Castlemaine Brewery Co. (Vic.) pays 6 per cent, for the
year, and Denton Hat Mills Co. 10 per cent.

condition of the old assets of the bank that nursed the
Mercantile, and his reasons for holding up his hand would
be interesting if called for. But nobody' calls for them.

President Zeal made the funniest little speech
at the Commercial Bank demonstration last week. “ All
had been sufferers in the collapse, and must do what they
could to put the old bank right again, as well as to put a
brave face on matters and bring back prosperity to the
dear old colony.” Previously Zeal had said that “ thd
occasion was no time for carping, but for united effort to
pull the dear old country out of the rut (? rot) into which
it had fallen.” What a dear old gentleman !

Matthew Davies’ brother, J.M., is one of the
sanguine solicitors to the Cotfimercial Bank. This is how
J.M. explains the old banking act which Attorney-General
Isaacs would amend —“ The Companies Act in England,
with reference to schemes of rearrangement, is defective
compared with the Victorian Act,” says Mr. Davies. “In
Victoria the scheme can be carried through the court
without winding up, but a scheme of this sort could not
he carried through unless the company concerned went
into liquidation.” Which means that according to Hing-
lish financial notions an institution that fails badly is
bankrupt, whereas in Victoria nothing ami nobody is a
bankrupt concern as long as the creditors will accept any
compromise, down to a halfpenny in the £.
Melb. business men thoroughly understand the
opposition of certain M’sP. to the Companies’ Bill. One
potentate’s connection with a somewhat smellful brewery
affair; another’s business relations with various banks,
and a host of similar matters, give the key to
the whole question. The public has invested its
money in the past in directors, and, having been bled, is
determined henceforth to have the Rontgen rays of in-
spection always in operation. The day of “ rallying
speeches” has gone for ever—such things would no more
allay suspicion than a mosquito-curtain would keep out
the cold. And well do the guinea-pigs of the past know it.

At last meeting of Melbourne Met. Gas Co. the
wail of the high-price shareholder was heard in the hall.
He had paid a very heavy premium on his shares, and
his notion of fair dealing was that the gas-consumers
should be victimised for his benefit. All dissatisfied cus-
tomers had already left the co. and taken to kerosene,
and the directors would do well to pause before promising
to take off the extra tax they had lately clapped on to
those unfortunates who have borne with the extortion
thus far —said the wailer. The duty of the general public,
as far as this broad-minded capitalist can understand it,
is to furnish a profitable investment for any person who
walks blindfold into the market and buys gas-shares at
the current price. Robbery without Risk is Fat Man s
motto.

The ex parte J. C. Pratt case, decided by N.S.W.
Banco Court a few days ago, besides making brewers and
hotel owners sit up, adds vast significance to the local-
option vote. It will now be necessary for every hotel-
owner, who does not wish to have the license cancelled
for at least three years, to personally see that the annual
fee is promptly paid. In the Pratt case, the tenant
applied for and got renewal, but failed to pay the fee
within the prescribed time, thus the renewal became void
and the house unlicensed. Then the owner brought an
ejectment action against the tenant, but did not recover
possession of the hotel for two months, and when he
applied for the license the bench refused it on the ground
that the 1.0. vote (taken meanwhile) was against further
licenses!

The Junction has readied the lode (more com-
monly known as the western development) at 670 ft. deep.
At that depth, though the size of the lode is not yet
determined, the quality is quite satisfactory. At the
upper level where the body was first encountered the lode
was entered a dozen feet before the friable ore was got;
in this case that class of stuff was struck within 2ft. of
the wall. Up above the lode is about 80ft. wide ; down
here Manager Phillips expects it bigger—talks about
100 ft. But it will take time to prove, as the water is
making very heavy, and the pumps cannot cope with it,
so that work is hampered. Meantime, while the develop-
ment is entirely reassuring, it is as well to remember that
the market price of the shares has been steadily advan-
cing in anticipation of it.
The 670 ft. in this working of the Junction is
not, however, 670 ft. from the surface. The “ western
development” is in a flat, while, the measurements are
taken from the brace of a shaft on the outcrop. Neverthe-
less this is the greatest depth at which a solid, continuous
body of friable ore has been encountered at Broken Hub
In the South they have friable ore certainly at 800 ft. ; but
it is only in small patches.
I
Concerning the South, shareholders at Broken
Hill, who have been patiently watching the game for 18
months past, are apparently getting tired. At a meeting
held the other day they resolved to be directly repre-
sented at any forthcoming meetings “to protest against
the present methods of working the mine.” Perhaps no
mine has had more support from people on the spot than
the South, and none has given such tantalising results.
From Jan. 1 to June 30, the B.H. South treated
in its concentrating plant 29,951 tons crude ore, which
was reduced in bulk to 9424 tons, containing 6469 tons of
lead and 74,5230 z. silver. The saving was thus equal to
79-1 per cent, of the lead and 46;fi per cent, of the silver.
Or, up-ended, one-fifth of the lead and more than half of
the silver was lost. Yet, according to recent decisions of
the B.H. Proprietary directors, this jigging treatment is
the best yet evolved. Obviously “ the solution of the
sulphide problem ” is a haltinar thing up to date, espe-
cially as the South ore isn’t a bad ore to jig by any means.
Thus the week before last the 1321 tons crude ore treated
assayed in bulk 28 per cent, lead, s’7oz. silver, and 19’4
per cent, lead ; the product was 485 tons concentrates,
assaying 68"6 per cent, lead, 7"70z. silver, and 7"8 per
cent. zinc.

A most peculiar mining accident occurred in the
Broken Hill Junction mine the other day. A miner at
the bottom of a shaft sent up a truck-load of rock. A
piece became dislodged, fell, cannoned against the side of
the shaft, and entered the arm just below the shoulder,
crashing through the bone and passing out. The wound
fwMoh was of a. most serious nature) presented all the

Hill End (N.S.W.): “The usual monthly escort
left here last week with 2030 z. gold.” Seven ounces of gold
a day from a camp that once put out cakes weighing over
7000 oz. each ! Hill End is not yet “ coming again.”

Mt. Drysdale (N.S.W.) : Three weeks’ run for
86oz. gold; that should not mean more than 7dwt. per
ton And this is the mine whose 125 shares about 18
months ago reached £BOO each! It had all the advantages
for a sensation : it was splendidly isolated, worked a won-
derfully rich little pipe of ore—any statement that it was
a pocket was laughed to scorn-ore was shipped to
Wallaroo, and the mill was only put up when the rich ore
was exhausted. Everything sold and boomed around it,
and now everything is sickening. It is 30 miles from
Cobar but Cobarites got the best of the boom. Their
enei-n-ies are now devoted to the mines nearer home, and
they are chagrined and amazed that the phenomenal
richness of the Peak has not given them another boom.
Cobar forgets that in N.S.W. once bitten in a boom means
40 times shy of anything within 100 miles of the same
town. , * . *

North Long Tunnel, Wallialla (Vie.), has spent
£86,000 in seeking the Long Tunnel reef, which the co.
reckons it has in the 1900 ft, cross-cut, and daily expects
to strike a shoot of gold-bearing stone. In any case, the
co is not down deep enough by 200 or 300 ft. to get any
good out of the shoot if it turns up now.
Toombon, Walhalla (Vic.), looks like div. this
term. Closes the half with £2OOO odd to credit, milling'
9470 z. ldwt. from 770 to is. Now driving for lode at
1030 ft., and when this level is producing yields are tex-
pected to maintain a good div. average. Long-patient
scrippers may prepare their thanks-offering.
Britishers at last have made money out of one
of their Bright (Vic.) specs. Twenty-five tons from the
Monarch, a new show clutched by the London-owned

the co., and the balance of 10,000 shares is held over by

British capitalist is expected to turn up.

Star of the West, Broad Arrow, 33 tons, 9240 z.
—a splendid return ; but the dead-and-alive character of
the small-crushing-big-return W.A. mines prompts the
question, “ How long will it last?” Where are the yields
of several others —for instance, Hill End, also at Broad
Arrow, and Hayes’ Hit-or-Miss in the White Feather dis-
trict. Both had their sensational small crushings, and
the owners of each sold out at big figures—Froggy getting
one, and Bull the other.

Norseman—" An ironstone formation has been
found six miles S.E. of Norseman, called Mt. Jagged. The
lode is over 45ft. wide, and gold is showing everywhere.’
In a state of nature, hundreds of big Westralian forma-
tions are full of gold, and, if you take an indiscriminate
sample, not showing very much gold, it assays all right;
but strange it seldom comes out in the battery or gets
into the bank. This clearly shows it is refractory. It
also depreciates in travel. Did not 400 oz. turn largely
into iron recently? And is it not a well-known and scien-
tifically attested fact that iron itself can be turned into
copper? These little troubles call for immediate atten-
tion of men up in the business.
* * * *
One W.A. mine, about which nothing has been
heard in the East for a year, has been re-opened, and big
blocks of stone, estimated to contain 800 oz. gold, have
been raised. These are to be sent to England. Alas ! are
specimens like this mere samples, or are they the mine in
bulk? J. Bullion has suddenly been struck with this
question : Why aren’t such magnificent things worked by
the finders ? Bull wishes he had thought of this before.

The secretary of the Croesus Extended mine
writes a Kalgoorlie paper in defence of the directors’ action
in selling at Is. a share and 20 per cent, of the new co.
in shares, less 5 per cent, commission. The directors had
to guarantee the wages, as there was no money available,
and there was nothing in the mine to justify asking, a
higher price. And this is the mine into which some mis-
guided fools bought up to 7s. a share on the advice given
and repeated 100 times by the great Sunday tipster!

Perth. —“ A trial crushing from the main lode
at the Pakeha mine, Broad Arrow, returned 20oz. to the

Greenhills rush (Croydon way) has turned out
5000 oz. of gold since January, and nobody (according to
Hoolan, M.L. A.) has done a hard day’s work. The first
gold in red clay (north of Pt. Curtis) has been found on
this field, wherefore puddling machines are necessary.

Mt. Bischoff panned out 1245 tons of ore for the
past half-year; since formation of co., 48,508 tons. The
co. should spare a ton or two for a tin statue of “Philo-
sopher ” Smith, the discoverer of Mt. Bischoff.

Extracts from a Tas. mining prospectus: —
“ This co. is being formed to work a 10-acre section at
Beaconsfield on the supposed line of the Tasmanian lode.
As will be seen by the report, the ground at a depth of
20ft. is exactly similar to that in the upper workings of
the Tasmania'gold-mine. The promoters have every con-
fidence, &c. Early application is necessary, as a large
number of shares are already applied for.” Similar to the
Tasmanian “ at a depth of 20ft.” should ensure ari enthu-
siastic rush for shares. Whether there is any similarity
at 800 ft. doesn’t matter at, all. Look out for the prospec-
tus of the Great Pan-Anglo Diamond Co. (a few shares
still available) consisting of a-half acre section at Booby-
Skinner, and reported as having at one time produced
scrub exactly similar to Mount Morgan. Shoo !

Dear Bulletin, — Thank goodness railway trans-
portation of mining plant is still difficult and slow on the
Coolgardie line. I am on the look-out for a large
quantity, and when I hear of its being on the road, it will

one-side for an indefinite period. The machinery will
kill the mine for a certainty, and break me up as a, mming
manager. —M.E. , * »

The marriage of Miss Buxton to Rev.
Bertram Hawker, at St. Peter’s Cathedral, Ade-
laide, July 23, was a gorgeous society affair. The
bride is much the handsomest of H.E.’s three
daughters, but she is extremely delicate. Mr.
Hawker, although S.A. born, is curate in charge
of a London slum-mission church, and the couple
return to London almost immediately. The
bridegroom has an income of about <£2ooo a year,
left him by the late George Hawker, the wealthy
squatter, once Speaker of S.A. Assembly.
* * * *
Capt. Guise, Governor Buxton’s serious-
minded aide, on the occasion of the recent vice-
regal trip to Oodnadatta, presented the aborigines
with a large parcel of tracts, which the poor nigs,
promptly presented to the local storekeeper,
thinking they were orders for groceries. Our
black brothers’ disgust on finding that the gallant
captain’s moral treatises on hell and damnation
weren’t convertible was unspeakable.

PROOF POSITIVE.
1ST SWAMAN : “ Where you tver at the ‘Go? ’”

2ND S. : “ Oi did not.”
1ST S. : “ Thin you were niver at the Go — so.”
Anglican Bishop Harmer was to have offici-
ated at the Hawker-Buxton marriage in Adelaide,
but the Govt, doesn’t know for certain whether it
can legally recognise his signature of “J. R.
Adelaide,” and isn’t sure whether, in that elevated
capacity, he can perform marriages ; it has been
trying for many months to decide the point.
Many happy couples who were married by Dr.
Kennion are in fear and trembling.

Although Adelaide Register devoted a
column to the description of the wedding-presents
to Miss Buxton, and two 1 and a-half columns to t
list of the dresses worn by invited guests, it care-
fully avoided mentioning the name of editor
Bonython, of the rival daily, who gave a costly
present, or of his wife and daughter, who attended
the reception.

Symon, Q.C., gave the S.A. Governor's
daughter, as a wedding-present, a photograph of
Auldana vineyard, of which he is proprietor. It
is not stated whether or not it bore the legend :
“Buy our best claret.”
The Anglican Bishop of Newcastle, preach-
ing a special sermon in St. Andrew T ’s Cathedral in
Sydney, received only a couple of inches notice in
SiM. Herald, whereas Card. Moran, preaching
an ordinary sermon at Bondi on the same day, got
nearly a column of report. The Nonconformist
conscience, struggling with the appearances of
things, is wonderful in its strategies. In this case,
probably, the Herald was thus moved because on
the Monday before it had given several columns
to the celebration of a blaring Orangeism !

A Sydney ph’oto-
grapher to a Bulletin
man:—“There’s a deal
of human nature in poses.
One theatrical manager
always wants to be taken
with a pen in his hand,
seated at a desk. It looks
literary. We’ve got a
pedestal and a ‘ property ’
roll —specially for a cer-
tain politician. He has
an idea that he looks
something like O’Con-
nell. Ladies are our
most difficult subjects.
They have invariably pre-
conceived and rooted no-
tions about effective poses
—and it generally means
two negatives. Next to
them come _ musicians.
One well-known virtuoso
is not satisfied unless he
is posed with a palette
and brush in his hand.
As a matter of fact he
can’t paint at all. Life
from a photographer’s
point of view is all pos-
ing. And it’s everybody
wanting to seem some-
thing different to what
he is.”

The other night a man roused up
a Sydney suburban police station
and said he’d fallen and ‘ ‘ sprained’ -
his leg. Investigation showed
that the bone of his leg was
snapped clean in two just above
the ankle, his foot hanging on by
much-lacerated flesh alone. Doc-
tors were sent for and the leg am-
putated. The only anaesthetic
administered was a stiff nip of
brandy !
“Let me tell
you,” writes a
N.S.W. solicitor,
“ about the worst

torney can do is to
obtain an acquittal
for his client—in
capital cases, at any

tation created by
the sentence which
brings the lawyer’s
name into promin-
ence. A quiet ac-
quittal is ruination

tioner, whereas a
gorgeous hanging is
a mighty advertise-
ment. If Meagher

Botany Bay law in Sydney. Witness : “I

useless forensic debate followed on the point
whether a witness can be compelled to answer
questions that tell against herself. His Honor :
“ After what the Crown Prosecutor has said, are

“No.” His Honor : “ Then you must answer all
questions just as any other witness must.” . . .
Ahem ! There should be but a short step between
getting evidence out of a witness by ensuring his

a witness by offering a monetary reward for it.

The Parkes (jST.S.W.) women-shooting-
and-suicide case was an affair of Blood and
Kisses. The man called the woman names over a
money dispute. “ Kiss me and make friends,”
was his next mood. She declined. He went for
his gun and returned. “Don’t be frightened,”
says he. “ I’m not,” says she. He knocked her
down, and then—bang, bang at her and her
daughter ! “ I won’t fire any more. Come and
kiss me ” —to the daughter. The latter kissed
him. “ I’ll go for a doctor,” says he. And he
did, and came back and ki: ied the mother. Then
he went to a cricket-match. When the police
wanted to see the kisser, he blew his own head off.

Melbourne’s Coroner philosophises :
“ When you are as old as I am you will know that
witnesses do not speak the truth. Indeed, accord-
ing to my experience, they never lie at their best
until they are bound by oath to speak the truth. ’
Dr. Youl likewise says that all women are liars, and
more subtle liars than men. If so, it is because
women pretend virtue everywhere, and the aver-
age man only in the witness-box.

An intelligent and zealous burglar robbed
a Bitzroy (Vic.) hotel the other night. He hid
himself in the house before locking-up time, and
at 2 a.m. began burgling. The proprietor awoke
and, disgusted at having his sleep disturbed, pre-
pared to attack and rout the marauder. But Mr.
Publichouse is a one-legged man, and Mr. Sikes
had carefully removed his timber-limb and thrown
it into the street. Which recalls the old story
about the giddy timber-toed, old-time Sydney
official, whose leg “gay” ladies used to keep m

head. The contrac-
tor is compelled to
pay his “ carters ”
a minimum wage,
and is expected to
deposit bodies in
the same order and
condition as he re-
ceives them ; and
there is a stringent
clause against sub-
letting, so that the
corpse-shifter who
procures a brother
professional to cart
“found-drowneds,”
“ suicides,” or “ac-
cidental deaths ” at
2Jd. per body, or
a reduction on a
quantity, is liable
to a fine of -£5O.
The hearse-owners
are eager for the
job, too, because it
gives them the
chance of first se-
curing the ear of
the relatives of the
late lamented, and
impressing upon
them the advan-
tages of the elegant
and substantial
funerals they are
now offering cus-
tomers at seven
guineas ; plumes,
crape, and a pro-
fessional mourner
with everlasting au-
tomatic glass tears
thrown in. They

Detective Goulder, of the Sydney police,
received promotion lately, and was duly compli-
mented in the press thereon, because of certain
acts of bravery allegedly performed by himi m
capturing two or three evil-charactered law
breakers. The promotion may have been light
enough, and the press eulogies right enough, so far
as the facts were concerned, but both were prema-
ture, and, therefore, reprehensible, inasmuch as
publication was made of them before the malefac-
tors were sentenced or tried.

High-wind story from Westralia. A resi-
dent, suffering from toothache, walked two miles
to his home one night in the face of a gal . •
As he neared his destination the humane which
had become cyclonic, nearly wrenched his head
off, and finally blew him into a fence. He felt a
sharp pain, and then the offending tooth, which
had been raging a few moments before, ceased to
ache. When he crawled home in a lull he found
that the molar was missing. The wind had turned
dentist and pulled it !

One of the sights of Sydney is the
gorgeously-fitted steam-launch with its uniformed
crew and the big flag flying astern, which calls
at Darling-street, Balmain, o’ mornings to take
Minister Young, of the God-fearing Cabinet, to
his office. It must cost the country a good many
pounds per an. to hump Minister Young--did he
swear off the penny steamer when he got his port-
folio?-—to his office. If the other Ministers arrive
at their offices in the same large and dignified
manner, the bill should be something consider-
able.

An Orange curse lay thick upon the Melb.
papers on the day after the Brunswick shindy.
In addition to the columns about that event, and
the news of the foundering of the Orange Grove,
the Age published an article largely about
Mildura oranges. It said :
And although we do not nowadays hold an orange in
our hand while being photographed, as the family of the
good Vicar of Wakefield did on a famous occasion, our
affection for the golden apples of the Hesperides has by no
means diminished with the greater plenty and cheapness
of modern days.
Now, Goldsmith’s vicar and family (see chap. 16)
did not have their photographs taken at ( all,
because photography was not thought of in Gold-
smith’s time ; nor did they have their portraits
“ limned ” with oranges in their hands. It was a
neighboring family who did that, and the worthy
vicar thought the orange-pose “a thing out of
taste.”

The Adelaide doctors who recently assem-
bled to curse at large over the local hospital dis-
pute not only u resolved ” that the action of the
two physicians who have accepted permanent
billets at the hospital is “ highly dishonorable, ’
but “ expressed their strong disapproval of cer-
tain other doctors who have been carrying on the
hospital work since the old medical staff went on
strike. Whatever the merits of the dispute may
be, if these other doctors hadn’t stepped in to
temporarily fill the gap the patients would presum-
ably have been left to rot in their beds without
medical attendance, and the patients were in no
way responsible for the row. Therefore, the
individuals who “ strongly disapprove of this
act of humanity certainly look like a most inhuman
and bowelless crowd of bone-sawyers.

When summer comes in her glory and brave the
whole earth blows;
When colors burn and perfumes impassion the
gladden’d air,
Then methinks thy laughter seeks me on every
breeze that goes,
And I feel thy breathing warm about me every-
where.
Or in the dreamy eve, when our soul is spread in
the skies,
When Life for an hour stands hush’d, and the
gaze is wide to behold
What day nor night may show, then sure it were
no surprise
To find thee beside me sitting, the piteous eyes
of old.
But’, alas ! when winter rains drive hard on the
blacken’d pane, _ _ .
And the wail of the lonely wind is lost m the
waste outside,
When the room is high and chill and I look for
thy face in vain,
I know that seas plash cold in the night and the
world is wide.

Sydney, August 5, 189(5.
My Dear Moorabinda—
The big Masonic charity ball in Sydney Town
Mall last W edresday was so crowded that only a
Kontgen ray could have got through the room five
minutes after starting-time. The public like a
massive Masonic ball, because there’s so much
circus in the ingredients, and because the catering
is always done on a colossal scale, as if the com-
mittee expected a school of sharks to supper.
Ihe last ball began as usual with a Noah’s Ark
procession of the worshipful brethren, who entered
under an arch of steel (rather suggestive of bul-
locks running the gauntlet of the slaughter-yard),
to mysterious monotonous music, each Mason with
ms glorified dilly-bag and tawdry horse-collar and
weird Masonic jewels, which I am assured are
costly and genuine, but which always look panto-
mime to me. After a walk round, which the pro-
cessionists took very gravely indeed, they halted
in a hollow square near the music, each worshipful
brother in his place with his toes turned out
When you think that the Masons only bubble up
m this magnificent style once per annum, it reflects
great credit on the man at the wheel that Brother
Blank s annual complicated manoeuvres don’t land
him in the middle of George-street instead of in
his apportioned position. But all goes well in-
variably— to the disappointment of the galleries
no doubt. ’
Of course, it all looks a lot of solemn ado about
nothing, and it’s a pity, from a picturesque point
ot view, that there is no standard height for a
Mason, for the profile of the procession, so to
speak, had a wavering irregularity that would give
a conscientious stage-manager the hump. Also
there is no stupid prejudice as to what color a
Mason ought to be. Three Japs (and that’s not
counting Quong Tart, who is vaguely understood
to be a Dutchman) turned up adorned with the
handkerchief sachet of Masonry, which is evi-
dently an evolution of the primeval fig-leaf ; and a
dusky y«uth, who might call Othello his uncle with
some show of apparent probability, also sported
the regalia. At midnight the ladies denuded the
e Masons of their vanities (women are ever on the
and sported the baubles themselves in the
me Lancers. Most of ’em hung the sachets
round their waists, which struck me as being an
error of judgment in some cases. They would
have been much more effective higher up.
_ Only a small spoonful of the salt of the- earth
flavored the Masonic ball. Gov. Hampden
turned up unadorned. His Ex.’s effective silvery
hair and dark eyebrows are quite wasted in
modern evening-dress. The Gov. as an “amber
snuff-box and a clouded cane ” (added to some
flowery tadormg, of course) would make a greater
effect than Kyrle Bellew in a powder part.
Lady Hampden (her Ex.’s dancing is really
of a most unstudied order) wore Wonga-
pigeon blue brocade with a cream brocade
petticoat and sleeves of electric-blue velvet.
Lhe Y.-shaped bodice was draped with snuff-
color lace and a sprinkle of diamonds; and a
com. bouquet, not forgetting her Ex.’s double eye-
glass, completed a rather pointless ensemble. I
often think it can’t be quite respectable to dress
well Australia the “ nicest ’’ people invariably
suggest that the tabs of their boots aren’t tucked
in. Miss Brand was effectively simple in blue
tulle and forget-me-nots ; her sister in cream bro-
cade with fakements of sapphire-blue velvet. But
a rococo dame of the V.R. party, in black with a
scarlet head-dress, reminded me of an enraged
rooster. The floor was good, the music of the
fashionable rapid tempo (Mrs. Ludlow played her
popular Crescent waltz for an extra and was
roundly applauded, and Miss Sylvia Blackstone
also played one of her sprightly waltzes), and the
decorations were impressively hung up.
Do you approve of the common vice-regal habit
of departing on top of the supper, as it were?
At big shivoos Her Majesty’s representatives
dangle about the dais until an excited committee-
man leads ’em off two by two to the region of
corkscrews, after which they take a hurried depar-
ture as if something they had eaten had not agreed
with them. For ordinary persons to rush for°their
wraps the moment after their hosts had furnished
forth sustenance would look rather greedy—as if
cold chicken was their magnet and not the per-
sonal charm of their entertainers—but then the
ordinary person has to be a lot more particular in
matters of this kind than Govmentouse. For
example, ordinary mortals generally learn to dance
before they plunge into a ball-room, whereas the
ordinary vice-regality seems to have only vague
rudimentary notions of the teetotum art, but
calmly faces the music nevertheless, though in the
very densest fog as to what will happen next. For
people who know positively that Fate will place
them at the top of the set, the disjointed manner
in which they amble about—in quadrilles espe-
cially—shows that preparations for an expected
contingency is not a V.R. virtue.
The show of “ diamonds ” on the floor at
the Masonic ball was simply paralysing. One
lady in ruby plush must have been worth half
Coolgardie, if all her stones were genuine ; and a
prominent bookie’s wife, in pink silk, sported a
really glorious diamond necklace —every stone in
it an eloquent sermon to punters.
Apropos jewellery—l believe I would rather see
counterfeit diamonds worn at night than real
diamonds on a woman in the morning. I lately
endured the agony of sitting opposite a Madame
Midas at breakfast, and she wore sealskin and
real diamonds. Ugh ! Diamonds for breakfast
is like the whiff of a stale cigar the day after you’ve
made a night of it. I know that be-diamonded
femininity era voyage urges as an excuse that jewels
are safest on the person—which well may be. But
there is no earthly reason why they shouldn’t wear
em under neath until the sun sets.
Sydney Amateur Opera Co. is going to break
out in (ye gods!) “Maritana” at “one of the
leading theatres,” which vagueness looks as if the
opera co. hadn’t yet discovered which was the
cheapest show-place. Why amateurs should want
to play “Maritana” I fail to see. One would
think the wig of the King of Spain and the lace
round his inexpressibles would be enough to scare
off any intelligent person—and the certainty that
the amateur Lazarillo will burst into tears as well
as tights on the eventful evening, and finally go
on draped in a tablecloth, might well give pause
to the most daring management. However

The latest courtesy captains extend to their pre-
sentable lady-passengers is doctoring their nails
for cm—finger-nails, of course, though I don’t
know what would happen if Trilby came aboard.
Poss'bly it s the reg’lation that captains should
attend to the claws of lady - passengers—l really
wouldn tbe at all surprised if it were. When you
come to think how women out-manoeuvre each
other to sit next to the boss of the boat, that
astute gentleman probably finds it a precautionary
measure to clip the dear creatures’ nails in the
event of the struggle becoming violent. And
there is no mistake how women burn to sit at Capt
Corcoran s right hand. When Arabella Goddard'
the pianist, was voyaging to Australia, she and an
Adelaide society-woman fought a pitched battle
over the question, and it’s on record that Arabella
won. Yet she played “Home, sweet Home”
divinely.
The relations of the brass-bound sea-dog with
the lady-passenger on inter-Australian mail-
boats are generally characterised by a great flow of
soul. Some of the officers revel in hand-painted
k v e-o clock tea-sets-though, to tell the honest
truth, the teapot appears more in sorrow than in
anger, and generally to hoodwink all whom it may
concern, as the tipple usually guggles out of a
bottle, h avored saloon passengers are invited to
the revels, and all is ’armony. Considering, then,
what little tin gods these youths imagine them-
-8?"es ’ story of a second officer and a well-
gilded widdy is worth recounting.
He had been impressively attentive to her all
the evening—had run to catch her when she fell
as the poet says, and considerately posed her with
h©r feet higher than her head, which is the wicked
seaman s invariable antidote to rnal de mer, though
1 have only seen it adopted by women conscious
°l , e . nciennes Uce on their underwear. Anyhow
the lady paralysed Mr. Officer, who was congratu-
latmg himself on having cut out the running
When madame rose to seek her heaving couch,
1 hank you, so much, she warbled, “ and here
(pressing a com into his hand), take this and get
yourself a drink ! ” Late that night his cabin-
mate was aroused to see the insulted mariner gaz-
mg as if hypnotised at the half-crown he held in
his hand—it was the coin’s turn to paralyse him.
Hut in the end a terrible revenge was plotted.
Chapter two Next morning, when the deck was
full of people, Mr. 2nd Officer approached the
widdy. Holding out her “ tip,” he said in a loud
marine voice—-the awful voice of a man who makes
himself heard above a steam-winch : “ So sorry I
couldn’t get what you wanted last night, Mrs
B ante, biit the bar was closed ! ” Of course they
all thought she had been after a florin’s worth of
whisky for a “nightcap.” She hasn’t tipped any-
thing loftier than a steward since.

IbOO guineas at the recent Sydney sheep sales, an
innocent German medico, unlearned in the ways

and found it difficult to swallow— l6oo guineas for

length he came to a happy conclusion: “One

The cream of musical and long-haired Sydney
perpetrated the troublesome compliment of a sur-
prise-party to farewell the Anakian City Organist
Wiegand, whom they besieged at his private resi-
dence on Monday evening. The plurality of City
Organists’ farewells savors of the floats. To my
idea, the system of turning up in gala attire and
with smiling faces to signalise anybody’s going-
away seems scarcely the neatest way of turning
the compliment. But, after all, these things, like
morality, are matters of geography. There is a
dark a,nd dirty race in Africa who twine flowers
in their wool and do the high kick whenever a
corpse occurs—it is their way of showing their
bereaved feelings. Apropos musicians, a comical
feature of the furrin’ variety in Sydney is that no

The Sydney Cercle Litteraire Francaise, so skil-
fully conducted by Madame Juliette Henri, had a
charitable fit last Monday, and broke out at Syd-
ney Gaiety in a Soiree Dramatique et Musicale
in aid of the Ashfield Infants’ Home. The infants
will be glad to know there was a large and swagger
audience. Madame Henri, in sumptuous array,
had the dramatic part of the biz. well in hand—
her own bright comedy, “Le Secret de la Mar-
quise, oil les deux Meres,” going very briskly.
Miss Pedley. and the St. Cecilia choir (I don’t
know why it is, but I always expect these warblers
to come on with their bare feet and their back-hair
down) womanaged the musical part, which lacked
snap—Mons. Boffard getting the only encore of
the evening for a sweet, somewhat feminine
rendering of “ David singing before Saul.” The
theatre was gorgeously dolled-up for the occasion.
Sydney fashions must be getting risky, to say
the least of it, if the description in Sydney D.T.
of the things worn by a society matron at the
recent wedding of a pretty Jewess is a faithful in-
ventory. I may be miles behind the times, but I
really must say that a lady who goes to a shivoo
m red velvet bodice and pretty French bon-
only those and nothing more scarcely
comes up to the standard of public decency. It’s
to be devoutly hoped that the lady had a lace
pockethandkerchief at least. Apropos of Society
reporting, the shortest way for a pen-lady to win
the approval of married society must be to allude
to Mrs. So and So’s pretty children, Mrs. Hash’s
charming little girls or spirited baby son and heir,”
and so on—judging by the nauseating frequency
) vlfc “ which such marmaladey allusions are made
in the daily papers. One would think that Sydney
nurseries were peopled with fairies instead of
ordinary red infants howling for buns and soiling
their pinafores. Though really while they’re at it
the pen-ladies might get in more gush. Some
mammas don’t appreciate baby getting all the jam,
but Beautiful Mrs. Blank’s angelic infants”
would give pleasure to all.
-The latest comic fad of the pious woman who
£ e arns to make seraphs of us all is called the
Christian Police Association,” and aims to make
a convert of the man in blue, who always had a
watch and frequently achieves a terrace of houses
quite early in his career. Instead of Robert arrest-
ing lottie, she now arrests him with tender in-
quiries as to whether he feels the stings of con-
science, and the beats of hardened policemen who
have not found the grace which the W.C.T.U.
female appears to carry around in a hand-bag are
darkened with damsels trying to measure them for

There now seems to be a hopeless breach
between the members of the (old) N.S.W. Art

as above every other word in the English lan-
guage, and would sacrifice anything rather than
do a dishonorable act.” Tit,:: Bulletin accepts
Pursy’s explanation, and, in a metaphorical sense,

The old ’un spoke : “I’m for giving
women votes. Why, the best working team I ever
saw had an old cow in the lead.”
Tasmania and Queensland put the eligi-
bility of Judges to sit as members of Federation
Convention to a Parliamentary vote. Queensland
pronounced them eligible, Tasmania ineligible.
Speculator M‘Eacharn has his syndicate
now ready, and proposes to submit without delay
definite proposals to Brisbane Parliament, concern-
ing the taking over of the Queensland railways.
“No Irishman in our Ministry,” echoed a
N.S.W. Freetrader, the other day; “in the last
90 years only two Irishmen sat in a .British
Cabinet. ” But how does Reid apply that historical
fact ?
Much tuss is made in S.A. re the advance
of <£60,000 to village settlements, but little is
heard about the hundreds of thousands distributed
amongst the squatters for pastoral improvements.
During the next three years <£350,000 becomes
due from the State to squatters in respect to
leases then falling- in.
The railway across S.A. to Port Darwin,
mooted by a foreign eo. (divs. to be State-
guaranteed, of course), was a pet scheme of con-
tractor Brassey (progenitor of the Vic. Gov.) who,
in the seventies, negotiated for its construction by
his firm on the “grid-iron” land-grant system.
The deal just missed fire.
In obtaining from N.S.W. Assembly a
three-months’ Supply Bill of over £2,000,000
Premier Reid has cajoled, by the bribery of muni-
cipalities and of “labor,’’from a. recreant repre-
sentative House its first prerogative—the control
of the public purse. And, in politics, the handling
of the money is omnipotence.
SMITH AGAIN.
MRS. BROWN: “ Well , well —NOW I know at last where

It doesn’t seem two years ago since Premie-
Reidwas asking the N.S.W. Freetrade-party to
join with him in adulating our staunch little
friend, M'Millan.”
NSW. Premier Reid, so far, flatly re-
fuses’to state how much the unpaid liabilities at
the end of the financial year amounted to. In
times past these have run as high as £1,000,000,
and as this is the first time they haven t been pro-
vided for in the year’s revenue, the public naturally
wants to know about them. The surplus of
£330,000 is no good if the liabilities that exist
against it run to twice or three or four times that
amount, and the fact that no information can be
obtained concerning these liabilities is ominous.
Queensland Leg. Assembly has
roused the wrath of the Northern
Civil Service by raising members
salaries from £l5O to .£3OO per annum.
The Q. Civil Service grievance hes in
the fact that Northern public officials
were severely retrenched three years
ago far beyond the intent of Parlia-
ment, and it is asserted that justice
should have been done in this matter
first of all.
N. S. W. Postmaster-Gen. Cook:
“In Victoria, where there was no free
postage, 15,000,000 papers a year
went through the post. In N.S.W.,
where postage was free, the number
wa535,000,000.” Why, cert’nly. And
if N.S.W. went a step further, and
gave everybody Id. for sending a
paper through the post, the number
would probably be 6,000,000,000, or
something like that.
N.S.W. Leg. Council's agree-
ment to reduce the cost of miners
rights from 10s. to ss. per annum is
another step towards making the
avenues to work easier for the feet
of the worker. The first diggers’
right issued in Australia was charged
for at the rate of 30s. per month.
Later the price went up to 40s. a,
month and then suddenly slumped
to 40s. per quarter, and for the last
15 or 20 years has generally run from
10s. to 10s. 6d. per year. The next
move will probably be. to a figure
which merely corresponds with the cost of the
instrument to the State.
The Maoriland Opposition attempted a want-
of-confidence vote against the Seddon Government
over its borrowing proposals. Seeing that a very
large part of the proposed <£1,000,000 is for unpro-
ductive jobs which will return no revenue, there is
good cause for complaint, but the spectacle of the
great borrowing party asking the people to put it
in office on such a plea is a gorgeous piece of
assurance.
N.S.W. Premier Martin put postage on
newspapers in 1864, Parkes took it off in 1874, and
Premier Reid, through his automaton, Cook, in-
dicates that he will leave things as they are.
Free-postage of newspapers can only be upheld as
a straight-out bribe to the metropolitan daily
press. “Itis a concession to Education yet, it
you put Shakespeare or the Word of God into the

N.S.W. “truck” legislators
should stick closely to the spirit and
letter of the following clauses from the
English Truck Act: “No workman to
be liable in debt for goods bought at
any shop in which his employer is
interested ”; and “No interest, to be
charged on advances of wages. In
many of the most reputable workshops
both these clauses are required in their
entirety. The latter one will pull up
employers who carry on a small loan-
office on the most substantial of all
securities —the wages or salaries they
intend to pay—and the former will
checkmate a numerous tribe of shar-
A Maoriland law recently passed
enacts that the domestic Biddy shall
have a half-holiday every week, ihe
Tory papers allege that, aooordmg to
good legal opinion, the Act is so rigid
that the Biddy must be ejected from
the house not later than 3 p.m. on her
half-holiday, and not admitted again
till 10 p.m., because, if she is found
on the premises between these hours,
she is presumed to be kept at work,
and her mistress is therefore liable to
be fined. And it wants to know what
will happen if it is snowing heavily,
and the slavey is ill in bed, and is so
heavy that her mistress can’t carry her
downstairs and throw her out into the
weather for the specified seven hours.
Which looks like a fine, humorous lie
_ofthe kind that the Maoriland Ass.
press revels in.
“New Guinea,” says Bishop
Stanton, “ has been handed over to the
missionaries.” By what right ? MTI-
- tried to steal New humea, but
was discouraged by the British Govt.,
which afterwards, “on its own,” stole
only a part of it. The missionaries
are now, if the Bishop’s words were
judiciously chosen, the receivers of
stolen goods. Australia maintains the
cost of the robbery. Why, therefore,
should the missionaries alone enjoy the
loot? Buccaneers all, strike for your
rights !
N.S.W. policy— Government by Contra-
diction, Logrolling by Select Committees and
Administration by Boards. And it takes 120 paid
members of the elected House to see it all done.
There is a small dissension in the S. A.
Labor-party’s camp. Wood, the Labor candidate
who beat Harrold for the Tory district of N.
Adelaide, stated in the House that he would vote
to turn out the Kingston Ministry—-m a word.
Wood has estranged himself from his party, and
special meetings have been held to consider what
steps shall be taken. Wood declines to sign a
pledge to vote with the other 17 pledged Labor
men.
Stewart, the retrenched N.S.W. civil ser-
vant, whose right to sue the Minister of Justice
for alleged illegal retrenchment has been upheld
by the Judicial Committee of Bntish Privy
Council, proposes to “go for .£l5OO. About a
million pounds’ worth of damages are l 18
said, to be claimed by several hundred other re-
trenched tite-barnacles, so that Premier Keid s
alleged surplus is threatened with utter and abso-
lute extinction.
Ex-Treasurer Ward’s own district of South-
land (M.L.), which was expected to rend the
fallen politician to pieces, has rallied round him
unanimously, and all Invercargill turned out to
welcome the great man who has gone under.
Come to think of it, considering that the Ward
Farmers’ Association scattered £lOO,OOO or so or
the Colonial Bank’s money in cold and windy
Southland, it would have been base ingratitude it
the provinoe hadn’t rallied.

The anniversary disease is so virulent
just now that at the Sydney Home Rule
meeting the other night someone, remembering
that 1898 wall be the centenary of the Irish
rebellion, thought something might be done to
commemorate the occasion.
Yictoria, since it got a constitution of its
own has had 20 different Governors, acting and
actual. The longest term of office was that
of the first vice-rex, La Trobe, which Tasted
15 years. During the same period of the
province’s history it has had 16 Parliaments and
27 different Ministries. The shortest Parliament
was the tenth, which began 11th May, 1880 and
closed 29th June, 1880. The shortest-lived Minis-
try was the sth, Nicholson's, which only lasted four
weeks, and the longest the Coalition of Service,
Berry, Gillies, and Deakin, which practically ex-
tended over seven years.
The lesson of the budget-debate inN.S.W.
Assembly : A deficiency is a surplus, and a surplus
is a deficiency, except when either is a cross-entry,
and then both mean each and each means both ;
also, since everything in political finance is a cross-
entry, there is never a surplus that isn t a defi-
ciency, nor a deficiency that isn’t a surplus, nor a
surplus deficiency that isn’t a deficient surplus;
and if you multiply the debit surplus by the credit
deficiency, and divide the credit surplus by the
debit deficiency, and subtract each from eaoh, the
remainders are equal, and, the equal parts being
equivalent to each other, the corresponding errors
are equal eaoh to each, and—the Auditor-General
will please affix his signature right here. y. Jt.JJ.
Three directors of the Australian G-asl? j
light 00., that hoary monopoly at which
gas-burning Sydneyites have sworn since
boyhood, are members of N.S.W. Legisla-
tive Council. In view of imminent Parlia-
mentary debates on the municipalisation or
nationalisation of products in common use,
these legislators should retire either from the
Council or the directorate.
The gorgeous new Houses of Parliament
which Premier Reid threatened to inflict on N.S.
Wales taxpayers are surely destined to go the way
of the castles in Spain. Does the Premier think
Federation is coming ? If he doe 3, what are these
gorgeous houses for? The Federal Parliament.
Then he’s counting his chicks before they re
hatched. If he wants to keep the other provinces
off, let him just say that and there’s an end to
Federation while he’s at the helm. Then, if the
Federal Parliament is elsewhere, what does
N.S.W. want with gorgeous palaces to house a
group of provincial politicians ?
“The present immense majority for Sed-
don,” remarks a Bulletin correspondent, “ is due
to having single electorates. The last election
was in ’93, and the votes polled for Govt., Opposi-
tion, and Independent candidates were in the
proportion of 4,2, and 1. Hence, to represent
public feeling, we ought, in a House of 70 mem-
bers, to have had 40 Seddonites, 20 Opposition,
10 Independent. And as, in many cases, there
was no Opposition candidates and no votes re-
corded, I think a fairer House would have been m
the proportion, 36, 23, 11. But the House, as
actually returned, was in the proportion, 51, 10, 4.
“Most millionaires are indifferent to
money. They simply love the game.”
When the Seddon Government established
co-operative works in Maoriland, it declared
in all simplicity of heart that married men should
have the preference over the uncoupled. As a
consequence, many of the works have become
dumping-grounds for female refuse. It has been
said that a demand for a tailor is not a demand for
a coat. In like manner, a demand for a married
man is not a demand for his wife.

to his Chair-duties, and those who thought his

But Speaker Abbott now knows that no social

Commons that point was settled years ago. There
is record of a Speaker, over 150 years ago, who
accepted an invitation from the King of the day,
and was thereby late for the Chair, and, notwith-
standing that he pleaded the Royal command, he
had to submit to a formal censure. “ The Grand

THE NEW ELECTORAL BILL\
The provisions as to aDsent electors give the
right to Vote by post. It an elector has reason to
I believe that he will be absent from his district on
[polling (lay, he can, after'the issue of the writ,
[obtain a certificate from the returning-officer, de-
Iclaring that he is entitled to vote for that par-
| titular district. The certificate is to be made
[on the back of an envelope, and Is to be forwarded
[ to the elector with a voting paper, containing In-
i' structions as to the method of voting. The elec-
tor, in his turn, must indicate the candidate for
whom toe intends to cast his suffrage by writing
the name of the candidate on the voting paper.
I Then he must, ih the presence of the nearest post-
-1 master, sign his name on the counterfoil of the
vfttlng paper. The elector must produce to the
'postmaster his elector's right, so that the signa-
| ture thefe may be compared with that on the coun-
I teffoll. “Then and there. In the presence only of
[ the postmaster,” the elector, must insert the vot--'
I ing paper in an envelope provided for the pur-
pose, and, “having seized the said envelope, must’
at once hand the same to the postmaster for de-
livery.” The returning officer who has isshed the
certificate must, meantime, have made a note of
| the fact, so that when the voting paper arrives,
: the signature may tye tested. Votes reaching any t
j returning-officer through the post must be -opened
| in the presence of the scrutineers; the counterfoil
bearing the signature must be torn oft', and the
! voting paper—which is supposed to be folded —
dropped in the ballot-box.

His Excellency, in replying, said that in this,
as in many other matters, he Was endeavoring
to follow the footsteps of his predecessors, as far
as he could. He had had an opportunity that day
of visiting tpe institution and seeing for himself
how things were carried cn. He could bear wit-
ness to ail that had been said with regard to Its
cleanliness and the excellence of the adminis-

The Duke of York voted with his amiable

Armand Jerome, Sydney sensational
alleged confidence-man, several times told a crony
that Brazil was the place for a man of brains and

An old-time Vic. poet, whose “Poems”
are on the shelves of Melb. Pub. Library, is a
money-lender, and does good business in a quiet
way. Imagine a poet, however small, having money
to lend !
Colonel North, who died worth only a
paltry half-million in England, was a capitalist
elsewhere, it is now stated. The bulk of his money
went into real estate at Ostend and more distant
places.
The group photos, of the Johannesburg
Reform Committee in London illustrated papers
accentuate one noteworthy point. Out of the
whole 50 or 60 members, mostly rich men, not one
wears a belltopper.
Gavan Duffy always professed to believe
that his public services more than balanced his
pension. Barrister Ireland had the same plunder,
and Duffy was represented as asking: “Why is
Ireland poor and discontented ? I’m not.”
Charles Cowper is not the only N.S.W.
sheriff to whom the field of politics looked green.
William Adolphus Young, who was sheriff from
1842 to 1849, became member for Port Phillip in
the old N.S.W. Parliament, and later on obtained
a seat in the British Commons.
Did Shiels really commit the following
mixed metaphor attributed to him by the Argus :
“ There are two ways of letting daylight in. . .
There is the honest way of proclaiming publicly
that which should be known, and the cowardly way
of striking a blow in the face with the assassin s
dagger.”
When Parkes published his
“ Beauteous Terorrist ” (verses eulo-
gising Sophia Perovsky, who helped
her lover, Roussakoff, to dynamite
Czar Alexander II.), he was taken to
task by one of his-friends for praising
a murderess. Whereupon the old
man explained that he had very
strong feelings against the autocratic
power of the deceased monarch, who
had done very serious injury to the
Australian people. “ I confess I
can’t see what you mean, Sir
Henry,” said his friend. “ Well,
I’ll explain,” replied the veteran.
“You see, one of the most persist-
ent hactions of this hautocrat is to
force the ’Ebrews to leave Russia,
and the result is that many of these
people come to this country, where
they usually set up business as
money-lenders, and, being persons
without any noble hattributes, they
charge the most h extortionate hin-
terest, and hinsist on ’aving it paid.
That, Mr. ,is the reason why
I have tried: to himmortalise one
who hassisted to rid the world of a
hautocrat whose baneful hactions ’ave
made themselves felt in Haustralian
business matters.”
A Sydney publican, vvho began
his “ colonial ” career in Canada, was
once man-of-all-work to John Mao-
donald, when Premier, at the
latter’s Ottawa home. Old To-
Morrow had been away electioneer-
ing, and being expected home one
night, Lady M. thought she would
prepare for him the fatted fowl. Ac-
cordingly the “ man ” was ordered to
go to tne poultry-yard and kill two
of the finest birds he could secure.
Now, the Premier’s latest fad was
prize-fowl breeding, and he had just
before imported some splendid “ Ply-
mouth Rocks ” at great expense.
Fresh from Ould Oireland, the
“ man’s ” knowledge of choice poultry
was as slight as a politician’s virtue,
and, to the horror of “ my lady,” he
returned with two dead ten-guinea
hens as the result of his foray. Her
ladyship’s vocabulary (continually
being enlarged by new epithets in-
vented by her objurgatory husband) was not un-
equal to the occasion ; and the bird-slaughterer,
reckoning that he could not stand a second ora-
torical attack from the Premier himself, instantly
created a vacancy in his billet.
The Melbourne papers disagree about the
Prince of Wales. One describes him as being now
qtiite slim and the proud possessor of a waist,
whilst another declares that he has abandoned his
intention of riding a bike because his embonpoint
will run all over the machine. Tubby or not
tubby ? that is the question.
Marcus Clarke’s “ Long Odds, ” re-named
“ Heavy Odds,” is just re-published. The bulk
of it was penned by Walstab, through Clarke
getting his skull fractured out hunting, not long
after the novel begun in the Colonial Monthly.
Walstab’s “ Harcourt Darrell,” written when he
edited the Calcutta Englishman, was a brilliant
novel, drawing a warm eulogy from the Saturday
Review.
Jawbone Neild, M.P. (N.S.W.), is going
to Hingland. Part of his impulse is to drift
around and ask questions about “State Old-age-
Pensions ; ’ but the mainspring motor that starts
him off is a desire to emulate “ Tiger ” Inglis, ex-
M.P., in his literary achievements. Tiger only
got into comic prose and dialect humor. J. Bone
Neild soars into the blank blankness of the white-
hottest empyrean, to say nothing of the purply-
blue welkin of doggerel.
Premier Kingston
travelled to Melbourne
to be present at the wed-
ding of Vabien Solomon,
M.P., who last year was
the strongest man on the
Opposition side of S.A.
Assembly, but who has
broken from the party
because of the appoint-
ment of Copley as leader.
Solomon, by the way, is
one of Adelaide’s lucky
Westralian speculators,
and draws .£65 a week in
rents from property at
Kalgoorlie.
Edward John Eyre,
one of the earliest of Aus-
tralian explorers, who still
lives in England, will be
81 on Aug. 15. He emi
grated to Sydney in 1833,
and in ’36 conducted an
exploration party from
Sydney to Swan River.
In 1840, for the S.A. Go-
vernment, he went into
the interior, explored
Lake Torrens, traversed
the Flinders Range, and
thence travelled to King
George’s Sound on foot, his only English com-
panion (Baxter) and two or three natives being
murdered on the way. In 1847 he was appointed
Lieut.-Gov. of Maoriland under Hori Grey.
The sound axiom about your right hand
and your left was widely departed from at the late
Sydney Masonic Ball, when Brother
, aged 87, was introduced to Gov. Hampden
as the “ oldest annuitant of the institution,” and
a Mason of over 60 years standing.
It is certainly anomalous that although a
solicitor of seven years’ standing is eligible for
appointment to N.S.W. Supreme Court Bench,
he is not eligible under the Public Service Board
regulations for appointment as a police magistrate
unless he passes a fresh examination.
Lecturer Clark says people in Scotland
care least of all for a lecture on Burns. When he
last lectured m Kilmarnock—Bums’ town —the
MAGGIE MOORE, as “Trilby O’Ferrall "
Photo., Bartlett Bros., Bendigo.
secretary of the local institute said he was glad a
lecture on Burns had not been selected. “And
why, pray ? ” said Clark. “ Weel, ye ken, we ha’
been juist Burrned to death ! ”
Melb. demise : Mrs. Hare, widow of Frank
Hare, P.M. He was one of the old-time police-
cadets, and as superintendent led the way to the
finale of the Kelly embroglio, after Standish and
others had been fumbling. Shot through the
right wrist in the Glenrowan rally, he wrote his
book on the Kelly gang with the other hand.
The demise of Miss Grace Rusdon recalls
that thin, tall G. W. Rusden, of the piping
voice and cheerful, boyish, nutcracker, clean-
smock, crab-apple visage, is still a Melb. familiar
His ambition was to live to complete the his-
tones of Australia and Maoriland, and he was
almost sorry after all that he lived to finish the
last. Its expurgation will only lead to the en-
hancement of the first edition, with its astoundintr
libels. 8
Ex-attorney Brady has been permitted to
employ himself in a “subordinate capacity” in
the Sydney offices of a highly respectable legal
firm. Those who know say that the Supreme
Court order that no disrolled solicitor should
engage in legal work of any sort without express
leave from the Judges, was framed in advance to
meet one case,, in which the man to be expelled
might have been appointed manager for his late
partner. But the little thing did not come off.
VOICE FROM SMALL BOAT : "Say, if any of you fellows meet a man
named Smith in Westralia tell him you met me, will you?”
A THOUSAND VOICES FROM SHIP : “ And who are you, mate?”
VOICE FROM SMALL BOAT: “My name’s Smith!”
Premier Turner rejoices over one citizen
tax-payer who pays ,£2860 to the State as his
yearly contribution from income derived from pro-
perty. Another pays £llO9 from earnings derived
from personal exertions. The latter (if not Sur-
geon Fitzgerald) is probably a lawyer, although in
providing a lawyer’s income it is usually other
people who have to make the personal exertions.
Kingston and Symon bludgeon each other,
but there is no art in their invective. Neither
rises much superior to the infuriated fish-fag.
Pity that they should thus waste their golden
opportunities, for seldom have such noble chances
of enriching the literature of abuse fallen to two
public men. _ In nothing does humanity so dis-
tinctly show its improvement on the anthropoid
ape, with his coarse, scurrile jabbering, as in its ap-
preciation of the artistic niceties of educated
opprobrium.
Artist Simonetti, who besides 44 sculping ”
the more insignificant members of the God-fearing
N.S.W. Ministry such as Cook, Garrard, and
small fry of that sort, is also tackling Premier
Reid. He complains that he can only get a sight
of Georgey-Porgey at lunch-time, when the gentle-
man is chewing sandwiches. “He not stay
steady,” complains Simonetti, in an agonised tone
of voice—“he chew, chew, always move hismowf.”
But why doesn’t Simonetti sculp the sandwich as
well as de mowf ?
Queensland papers seek to glorify the
°pgj n °f the late “Dingo” Donaldson, speaking
of his father as “ well-known in pastoral circles,”
aud so on. Donaldson used manfully to say his
L.ther had been a little farmer, and that he him-
self had carted firewood for a living as a boy.
“ Many a time I’ve gone home crying with hunger
and the load still on the dray unsold,” he would
say. “Dingo ’ was a strict teetotaller himself,
but would buy a dead beat a reviver if his tongue
looked dusty. But if Donaldson didn’t drink he
smoked. How he did smoke !
Old James Lynch, a patriarch who pegged
out recently at Clermont (Q.), was a man with an
experience. Fifteen years ago Lynch, who was a
good deal of a patriarch even then, was dying of
asthma in the local hospital, and his grave was
dug and his coffin made in readiness for his
decease. He would probably have died in due
course, only some inconsiderate person mentioned
to him that bis sepulchre was quite ready, where-
upon the infuriated old man arose from his bed
a Sr • s l olemn 1 1 y cursed the previousness of the
officials, and walked home. There was a coolness
between him and the hospital ever afterwards.
Prof- Haslam, of Canterbury College
(M.L.)j had a unique experience a few years ago.
He went to England, and, when about to return
cabled his wife— “ Coming home.” The cable
man knew better than he did, and rendered it—
Come home.” Mrs. Haslam accordingly packed
up and departed per next boat. When the Prof,
arrived he found his penates flown, and went off
again to bring them back, but his dutiful spouse
having arrived m England and found her lord
on the way to the other side of the globe again,
took passage in the next ocean steamer. Thus
they chased each other round the world for some
months.
Melb. commercial recollections are evoked
by the demise of Alfred Ross, a typical merchant
of the era so graphically depicted in Train’s
n J°?X?f mer u a Ab ™ a £” The members of
were mIT ™ ° f Westgarth and Ross
were Melbourne’s crack importers. Their
income at the zenith was .£lOO,OOO a year
and they had as many as 15 ships in Hob-
son s Bay at once. Spowers, the Argus man
came into the firm later. When Melb. Chamber
of Commerce started, 40 years ago, the West-
garths Rosses, Nanki veils, Raes, Lorimers, Moores
Dalgetys, and so forth ruled the community 3
the Argus at their core ; but there were two
traitors m the ranks, M'Culloch and Francis me
pared to lead the cause post-haste to destruction.
Old Lancashire cotton-spinners still rever-
ence the memory of a mill-owner named Richard
Seddon, who, during the horrors of the cotton-
famine, ruined himself by sticking to his hands
through thick and thin, and feeding all whom he
could reach and not on the usual rancid bacon'
and mildewed bread. A son of his of the same
Christian name went to Maoriland. Is Premier
Dick the man ?
A pleasanter existence—frequent change
oi scene and climate, with good company—than
that led by the dealer in brains whose portrait
appears in this column, cannot be imagined j
and he has led it for thirty years. It was iii the
early sixties that R. S. Smythe, then on the Par-
liamentary staff of an Adelaide daily, grew weary
of recording the utterances of colonial legisla-
tors and resolved to see the world. Having thea-
trical as well as Parliamentary duties, he knew the
show-folk of the period, and his original venture
was a couple of Italian opera-singers—the Bianchis
a fat tenor yoked with a still greasier prima-
donna ; and the first mystery into which the
ingenuous young agent was initiated was that he
must always engage separate apartments for the
harmonious yet amorous pair, or the tenor next
night would sing flat. Another of Sinythe’s early
stars was Margaret Aitken, a celebrated Scotch
elocutionist, who sold all the front seats for
her opening entertainment in the old Melbourne
Exhibition Building by announcing that the
committee of the Caledonian Society would sit on
the platform, which was a rather high one, in full
Highland costume, and who afterwards in Hobart
was cried by the bellman, a poor old exile whose
education was limited, as “the celebrated exe-
cutioner.” It was immediately after his engage-
ment with Miss Aitken that the man who was to
become known as the Much-Travelled (a title
originally conferred by The Bulletin) began his
world-wanderings, opening up the Far East,
India, and South Africa to European artists, so
that by 1871 he had met with so many adventures
by flood and field that his experience formed tha
subject of cm article in the Corn hill Magazine.
Yet it was after this that Smythe did most
of his globe-trotting—ostensibly in search of
talent, but often doubtless to gratify the lust of
travel—visiting most of the European capitals,
crossing America from Vancouver to Nova Scotia,
and touring Britain from Inverness to the Lizard.
Twenty years ago the Moltke of managers, as
Archibald Forbes called him, struck out an entirely
new path. Abandoning music and the drama,
and knowing the propensity of humanity for
gazing at remarkable men, even at murderers on
the gallows, he started that Jong procession of
celebrities, beginning with Proctor, the astronomer,
and ending with Mark Twain, who have provided
pleasant weekday evenings for thousands all over
Australia and Maoriland In this work R.S.S.
has been wonderfully successful, and there is no
doubt that his name at the foot of an advt. means
a good deal. Not that all his stars are of the
same magnitude. He will not run a nobody. A
man must have either a name or talent; yet it
would seem as if some of the inferior lights run but
not chosen by him are exploited at. their own r
If the public verdict is adverse, the engagenu t

is not renewed : they have had their day and cease
to be. In the musical world, to which he some-
times returns, as he did with Santley and the
Halles, the enterprising impresario only arranges
with the best; he abhors mediocrity, of which there
has been more than enough lately; he never touches
either fossils or infant prodigies; and it is
a striking instance of his critical judgement that
his contract with Paderewski was dated away back
in 1891, before the famous pianist achieved those
triumphs in Europe and America which have
hitherto prevented him from fulfilling his Austra-
lian engagement. Recently the veteran manager
has had an able lieutenant in his son, Carlyle
Smythe, at present travelling in South Africa
with Mark Twain, while he himself is arranging
the farewell seasons in Sydney, Melbourne and
Adelaide of the Rev. Charles Clark, the first and
best of the lecturers, upon whose like we are not
likely to look again.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Minyarrah from London to The Bulletin :
“At Lord’s. England v. Australia. The thousands
assembled under the low forward-sloping, canvas-covered
frames, resemble so many myriads of black and white
ants peeping out from under inverted spade-blades. Later
the swelling band of onlookers surges out on the playing
area, fully 50ft. in some places, and makes the English-
men’s fourers easier and Australian deep fielding and
catching impossible. The ground will hold under 20,000
comfortably, and the M.C.C. comes in for strong adverse
criticism for allowing 10,000 more to enter than can be
accommodated. Those who cannot see amuse themselves
by throwing bombs of pebbles and paper at those who
can, and the police are powerless.
“ ‘ This team should be called the Trott-ers,’
said one disgusted Australian as his countryman proces-
sionized to and from the wickets on the Monday. That
first innings was one of the saddest, sorriest, and
sickest spectacle ever witnessed on any cricket-ground.
The ‘lB’ against ‘ M.C.C. and Ground ’ was almost- credit-
able in comparison to this total of ‘53 ’ on a first-class
wicket. 1 Funk,’ or nervousness, or that midway state,
equally disastrous, so hard to define? Richardson and
Lohmann, with the rattle of falling wickets around, and
flying bails before them, bowled splendidly. Donnan
idiotically ran himself out; Darling, Gregory, and Eady
batted with pluck, without luck ; the remainder —well,
they are Australians and there was a second innings.
“Richardson clipped Darling’s bails with a
‘ ringer,’ Eady found himself given ‘ caught behind,’ and
placed his hand on his breast—‘ more in sorrow than in
anger’—to show where the ball had touched, and the
second innings opened with 2 for 3. In the ‘ pros.’
pavilion, Albert Trott’s face, stretched by his dropping
jaw, obscured his shirt front, but visibly contracted as
‘ Joe ’ went to the wickets. What followed is ancient but
long-living cricket history.
“ Grudgingly it must be admitted that no Aus-
tralian audience could be more encouragingly enthusiastic
than was that Lord’s assemblage as Trott and Gregory
made their brilliant stand. At each progressive point in
the score the applause rose and spread in a thunderous
canopy, accompanied by loud and genuine cries of
‘Bravo,’ ‘Bravo’—the ‘ haw-haw’-ism of which mav be
excused for their heartiness. No more sportsmanlike
spectators were ever assembled round a ‘ pitch.’ They
wanted ‘Gallery’ Grace and his men to win, but never-
theless saw with impartial eyes and appreciated with
ready hands.
“ The Australians’ batting is much below par,
the bowling beyond expectations, but the fielding, in which
they were thought perfect, is by turns smart and faulty.
Had several missed chances been taken in this match
‘ the result might have been very different.’ Kelly will
never be a Blackham, or a Jarvis even, and with Hill,
Graham and Trumble drops catches a pennant player
would grip and hold like a mud-dredger. Jones fields
like the iron man he is, Eady follows him in patches,
whilst Trott, Gregory and Darling miss little.
At a big match F. S. Jackson is the prize pug-
pup on show with pale-blue ribbon knotted round its
neck and tail. England’s most dashing bat, the son of
the late Chief Secretary for Ireland, the Cambridge man
is a more obtrusively conceited cricketer than even being
one of the three ‘gentlemen’ to represent ‘England’
should encourage him to be. That such a man, wearing
pale-blue tinted pads and an all-pervading air of self-
suppurating conceit, can make runs is a downright dis-
couragement to the majority of modest ‘ cracks.’
* * * *
“If the real cause of Australian defeat in the
first big match was thoroughly sought,’ writes an Aus-
tralian abroad to The Bulletin, it would probably be
found that they were too well fed and housed. Tables
d’hdte, arm-chairs, and obese cigars are only suited to the
Fat Man waiting for dividends.
“ The defeat of the Australians by the Midland
counties should never have happened, and would not if
the ‘ Colonials ’ had put any real life into their work in
the early part of the game. It was only when defeat
loomed up that they seemed to awake, but then it was
too late.
“ Clem. Hill’s fine innings of 98 against the
Midland counties was only marred by the fact'that it was
two short of a hundred. He did not give a chance of any
kind, and played all the bowling with easy confidence.
He has had a bit of bad luck lately, but is certain to make
a lot of runs before the tour is over, and will probably
fight little Syd. Gregory for top place.
English people are most keen about winning
5? e r,^ st ' matches ’ and the aristocratic members of the
M.C.C. are most prejudiced. One gentleman (a colonel
by the way) got furious over the brilliant stand made by
Gregory and Trott, and kept ejaculating ‘ Curse them,
why the devil don t they get out ’ ; or if a ball bumped
high and was unsafe to touch, ‘ D you, tip it, touch
it and get caught, for God’s sake’ ! As the score mounted
the gallant warrior relapsed into gloomy silence, broken
now and again by a curse. But he was only one in a
thousand.
“ Thht collapse of Australia in the Ist innings of
the first test-match was a miserable business after the
18 previously totalled on that ground, and had it not
been for the magnificent stand by Trott and Gregory in
the second try, the reputation of this Eleven would have
been gone. As it is, a number of the papers now only
give them second or third place in the cricket reports
where they at first invariably headed the matches. ’
“ In view of the lack of form shown by Iredale
latterly, the selection committee had little choice but to
leave him out. It was a choice between Iredale and
Graham (for all the rest who were chosen had been doing
pretty well), and Iredale, who had been the more con-
spicuous failure, was left out.
v. has been unfortunate with his
hands all through the tour, received a severe iniurv in the
second over of England’s first innings during the test-
match. In stopping one from Grace he split his hand
badly m an awkward place, between the thumb and first
fn ! fer - Iredale fielded for him, but in hopes tbat he
could keep his wicket up while Kelly made a few runs he
went in last m Australia’s second innings, and though in
much pain, batted pluckily for over half-an-hour, practi-
cally with one hand.
“ The stand made by Trott and Gregory in the
nrst test-match must be considered one of the finest exhi-
bitions ever given in international cricket. No previous
partnership in these matches has put on as many as 221
runs, and, in addition, it was done without giving a
chance. The only semblance of a chance was given by
Trott to Hayward in the slips. The ball went low and
very quickly, and seemed to touch the ground and Hay-
ward s hands simultaneously. The fieldsman threw the
out U Ti/ Ut T f rott a PP ealed and the umpire gave him not-
out. This, of course, caused a lot of discussion. The
English press was divided ; Hayward and many of the
English players were certain it was a catch. I was watch-
lng very closely, and it was so very near one way or the
other that I should say that if cricket is to be plaved in a
sportsmanlike way a batsman must be got out more de-
thaU that b6fore he ff ° eS ‘ Trott Was 61 at the
“Gregory’s play this year in England certainly
stamps him as one of the finest bats in the world. Strange
that Abel, of Surrey, who heads the English batting
averages, should be another little fellow, about an inch
taller than Syd.
, ‘ ‘ Many complaints and discussions are heard as
to whether Jones does not throw when sending in his
fastest ones. His deliveries have now been passed by the
leading umpires, and it is unlikely that he will be no-
balled now. As a matter of fact, all swift bowlers are
accused of throwing more or less, and if Jones had not
proved successful, or had not hit a few of the batsmen,
we should have heard nothing about it.”
* * * *
The safest All-England Eleven procurable at
the present time can’t be expected to get rid of the Aus-
tralians for small scores, or to run up a very big score
themselves. Given fine weather, the Australians ought to
make a draw of the third test-match, if they don’t actually
win. This seems to be about the most promising A.E.E.
on recent performances Grace, Stoddart, Abel, Gunn,
Ranjitsinghi (or Jackson), Hayward, Lilley, J. T. Hearne,
Pougher, Richardson, Woodcock (or Lohmann). Yet it
includes only two batsmen who have scored a “ century ”
against the visitors, and not one bowler whom they haven’t
punished severely at one time or other. A second team
of almost equal strength might be picked from the less
“ representative ” players, but that fact doesn’t touch the
point that the best English cricket has little or no ad-
vantage over the best Australian ditto, except in being
older and more artful. Our Boys don’t, as a rule, carry
their top “ form ” into the old and artful stage.
* * * *
Australian cricketers had not won a test-match
in England since 1888.
* * * *
Dear Bulletin, —It was not the miners of Kal-
goorlie who, when the Australians were all out for 53 in
the first innings of the test-match, clubbed together and -
wired Musgrove to send the team home, etc. The miners,
to a man almost, of this field are proud of the team. The
senders of the wire were certain upstarts who, by some
chance, have got hold of more money than is good for
them, and duuno where they are.—Miner. Kalgoorlie,
July 19, ’96.
♦ * * *
Ed. Bulletin, —Your cricket-scribe tries to
excuse the English defeat in the test-match on the
ground that they had to play faster than the Australians,
and so lost their wickets cheaply. The team going in first
in England and scoring 400 runs is, judging bv past
experience, almost safe from defeat, and, as the English-
men had the first match to their credit, is it not unreason-
able to say that they threw their wickets away by hitting
so as to prevent a draw ; especially in the second innings,
which they started 181 to the bad ? Grace didn’t throw
his chance away by hitting—he was much slower than
usual ; and Briggs, who was “ sent in to stonewall,” was
bowled for a duck. Ranjitsinghi, the fastest scorer on the
English side, was the only really successful batsman. Now
for the other side, which doesn’t appear in The Bulletin :
“ There was an inexplicably tedious display for about an
hour. Quaife, who over-night had made 45, took nearly
three-quarters of an hour to bring his score up to 50; and
Bainbridge, who used to be a rapid sewer, was in an hour
for 7.” (The Cricket account of the Australians v. Mid-
lands match.) Only the other day, the champion county,
Surrey, took all day making 283, and the Australians
scored 367 for their day. Notts took all day getting 276,
and Gloucester the best of an afternoon getting 110 against
“ Our Boys.” The Australians have beaten all the coun-
ties and England, so they can well afford to do without
the praises of your scribe, as the strong tree may still toss
its plumes though a vagrant leaf has blown away.—Aus-
tralian.
• • * *
London Times had a leading article on the first
test-match. The article, of course, concludes with the
observation that this match has added several horse-
power to the silken bonds.
* * * *
Noticeable how the attendance on the second
day of a match between the Australians and English
local teams falls off if the former have a big lead, and in-
creases if the reverse.
* * * *
The Australians lost no credit by the defeat at
Bexhill, and the annoyance of it will no doubt serve to
tickle their energies. The maddest man in the crowd
must have been Harry Musgrove, who took a hand and
helped to lose the game.
* * * »
Much sounder play was noticeable in the Q.-
N.S.W. return than in their initial contest. And the
crowd showed a livelier appreciation —because the locals
piled up 15 as against 9 points. Sydney’s heavier weight
and splendid combination were the chief winning factors.
The tourist backs got few opportunities, and their efforts
were often nullified through smart following up. Hanna,
whom the Union wanted knocked out on account of undue -
aggressiveness in an inter-club match, shaped excellently.
The selectors showed commendable spirit in refusing to
be over-ridden.
* * * *
For a change, high-class football distinguished
Saturday’s Melb. senior matches. Fitzroy, expecting to
run over Essendon, played plucky, skilful and pretty foot-
ball for three-parts of the game ; then, losing heart and
head, went to pieces. Essendon won by sg. to 2g.
S. Melb. and Melb. had a hot contest, every
inch of the game being keenly fought. Given one sure
goal-kicker, South would down every other club in the
Premiership, its play at present being perhaps better
than ever before ; but 2g. 14b. to 4b. tells its own tale.
Collingwood won its Geelong match by Bg. to
5g., and St. Hilda, putting N. Melb. through 4g. to 2g.,
moved up to sixth position on the premiership list.
* * * *
What the sport has come to. All Newcastle-
matches postponed, bar one, because referees were unob-
tainable. Umpires now regularly patronise accident
insurance offices. There is more danger in being an)
official onlooker than a neok-or-nothing player.
* * * *
The noble game of football as played in Vic-
toria :—“ The woman ‘ barracker,’ indeed, has becomeone-
of the most objectionable of football surroundings. On
some grounds they actually spit in the faces of players as
they come to the dressing-rooms, or wreak their spite,
much more maliciously with long hat-pins. . . In the-
height of this some of the women screamed with-
fear, others screamed, ‘Kill him !’ At the close of the
struggle one of the gentle maidens who ‘ support ’ foot-
ball remarked regretfully that it was a pity they’! let
off ’ the umpire in the Geelong match, as they should have
killed him.”
* * * *
The attack of the women upon umpire Roberts
at N. Melb., the other Saturday, has upset an idea the .
present writer has long been hatching. The scribe was
about to suggest the advisability of training up female
umpires in the way they should go. The toughest male,
crowd would not be likely to fall foul of a female umpire,
to her serious discomfort, but the designer reckoned!
without the new women—the up-to-date She who is a
bit of a sport. She attacks the male umpire, tears off
most of his clothes, and lets the air out of him with hat-
pins, where his decisions displease her ; what would she
do with a referee of her own sex? Go to extremes, pro-
bably, and destroy her hat. . .
* * * *
Little publicity is being given to the Blackham
testimonial. Melb. C.O. has donated 50gs. Commencing
in 1870, the peerless wicket-keep has played in first-class-
matches since’74, and been in every ’Ome team from’7Bi
onwards. That Pennant match accident last season pre-
cluded selection for the present tour, and he will unlikely
don the pads again.
* * * *
The Ballarat people, who ridiculed Artist’s
chance of winning a big event under a heavy weight, evi-
dently knew more about the horse than the Millers could
bring themselves to believe. Artist cut a very poor
figure in the Caulfield G.N. Hurdle Race. The handi-
capper will have to take at least a stone off his back next
time he is entered in good company.

Resolute, a promising Derby horse in W. R.
Wilson’s stable, won the Malakoff Stakes flutter at Caul-

Irritating and Disfiguring
ERUPTIONS
On the Face, Cured by

Remarkable Experience of Miss Dorothy

we are privileged to give below:

“I take pleasure in testifying to
the great benefit I derived from
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. I suffered
from eruptions on my face of a very
irritating and vexatious nature.
- For a considerable time I experi-
mented with various so-called blood
medicines, but without any allevia-
tion of my trouble. At last, your
famous Sarsaparilla being strongly
recommended to me, I began to use
it, and after taking two bottles it
was most gratifying to see and feel
the effect in allaying the irritation
and reducing the eruptions. When
I had used three bottles the erup-
tions disappeared altogether, with-
out leaving a mark on my facy and
I have never been troubled with
anything of the kind since.”

Melbourne is being canvassed for subscrip-
tions for another bell for St. Paul’s, which has a
great deal too much bell already and does its full
share in the brazen clangor which makes the good
city of Smellburst unfit to live in on a Sunday.
Victoria, despite the revival which has set in, is
still in a woefully bad way, and the brand of piety
which wants money for bells just now is of a pretty
crude description. Likewise, it shows a great in-
capacity to understand the fitness of things. The
church which preaches about the sweet and fault-
less music of Heaven and points its discourse by
pounding a horribly discordant tom-tom on earth
is an incongruity.

The troubles of a ‘ ‘ club doctor. ” A
Sydney-suburban Scawtch doctor, while receiving
patients in his consulting-room, was interrupted
by a savage call—“ You’ve got to come up at once
and see X. ; he’s dangerously ill.” “I’ll go when
I ve attended all my patients here,” “No, you
must come at once ; it’s a case of life and death.”
No, sir. I know the X’s. ; they’re always
going to die. There’s nothing much the matter
with X.” . . . Two hours later the doctor
(and please note that he was Scawtch) saw X. in
bed ; and, upon his entreaty, examined his right
Hb Mrs. X. being present. Turning to Mrs. X.,
the doctor (mark you, he was Scawtch) asked:
‘You have a family?” “Yes’r, six.” “Are
they at home?” “ Yes’r.” “Bring ’em all in
here. I’m going to perform an operation, and I
don t know how things may turn out. They had
better be present.” Six assorted kids were ranged
ip f) ne beside their groaning and trembling father.
Now, Madam, ” said the doctor (remember,
he was Scawtch), “ I must trouble you for a basin
of warm water, a clean handkerchief, and a darn-
ing-needle.” The kids began to sob as the lethal
instruments were brought into the chamber of
suffering. Swiftly the doctor (and he was Scawtch!)
pricked the boil (X gave a howl), expressed from
it about a pin’s-head of matter, and dabbed the
awful place gently with the wetted handkerchief.
(( Will he die, doctor dear?” asked Mrs. X.
“Sairtainly, when his time comes. But I’m
happy to inform you, madam, that the operation
has been entirely successful, and has been borne
by your husband with heroic fortitude. Put a
bread-poultice on the place, madam, and let him
eat and drink as much and whatever he likes.”
And he was a Scawtch doctor !

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

The advent of the Dunlop tyre marked a new
? ra *cycle history, for it is no exaggeration to say that
rt did more to popularise cycling than the cycle‘itself.
The Dunlop tyre made the cycle a perfect pleasure-giving
machine, and multiplied the number of C3 r cle-riders by 5o!
It accelerated racing speed to such a degree that second-
raters riding Dunlops hummed away smiling from top-
notch ers who hadn’t them. During 1895 no fewer than
1251 world’s records, as well as countless national and
local records, were beaten by Dunlop tyres. While
conflict as to who are champions from lap to
24-hours contests, there is only one opinion as to which is
the best tyre—you can guess it in once—the Dunlop.*

It is not very improbable that the winners of
the coming double, Caulfield and Melb. Cups, started for
the Balaclava Stakes on Saturday. The field behii d New-
haven included Nada, Devon, Marusa, Alphine and
Malula, and considering that Nada was backed like a
dead-bird ” the Derby favorite threatens to prove a
smasher in the spring.

Summerlea was reported by the knowing ones
but the Melbourne knowing ones have
a habit of not knowing much about “ Billy ” Jones’
cattle.

Madge Gordon’s defeat in the first Sapling
Stakes, at the Y.A.T.C. meeting, was a considerable shock
to Mr. Seji. Miller, whose fondness for early two-year-old
racing will not survive many disappointments of that.
a 0”: A’l .Pernicious three-furlong bursts of last
August the Miller candidate was invincible.
* * * *
The defeat of Mr. C. M. Lloyd’s crusade against
early juvenile racing at the V.R.C. annual meeting by 84
to 81 wasn t unexpected, but the close call augurs ill for
the continuance of the system in Victoria. The mover
has all the argument on his side. Experience shows that
squibs seldom last long, and are useless at the stud
* * * *
Saturday s Bank Handicap sweep - money
scramble, at Warwick Farm, brought out a fine field of
26, and imported Dalmeny held his own against the Aus-
trahans. Well-backed all-round the week previous, the
little black wasn’t started owing to the moisture.
Valiant s 9.7 didn’t prevent him running a great race and
getting fourth. Favorite Newman now owes the nublic
many thousands. r
* * * *
The inclination to flatsidedness and absence of
staying-power attributed to Newhaven will be unre-
servedly withdrawn after his Balaclava Stakes win under
8.10. Both he and Resolute won their Caulfield races in
style on Saturday, though not near fit. As half-a-dozen
other Derby colts are said to have big chances, this year’s
riband should be more interesting than the Cup
* * * *
Another sacrifice to the god of amusement
Jockey W. M‘Leod and racer Teralba, both dead through
a fall in Warwick Farm Anniversary Stakes. Prince
Chester and rider, falling at the same time, escaped scathe-
less. The old story—“ the home turn.”
* * * *
The 42 seekers of fortune collared in a Melb
tote-shop averaged 3s. each. These wayside “plun°ing”
resorts are frequented mainly by the cream of loaferdom •
professors of language and tobacco, gleaners of informa-
tion, and pickers of the pockets of respectability.
In four seasons sensational Hova scored 12 wins
8 seconds, 5 thirds, and was 20 times unplaced The
retired champion never won a paltry maiden-plate, though
he started in three.
* * * *
Summerlea’s winter race at Caulfield was the
third consecutive National in a few weeks for which 13
started. Also, it was the third ring-victory over the
public who are always trying to take them down. Jockey
Jas. Hayes parted with Summerlea to W. T. Jones a
month or so back. A National and a Balaclava Stake
with two outsiders in one afternoon is very payable horse
amusement.
» * * *
Nada ought to have done better than third to
Newhaven on Saturday, but should be equal to a big cash-
prize later on. She is the most leniently treated of the
St. Alban’s string in future distance events.
* * * *
The first Cup eliminations provide little for
comment, sensational withdrawals being reserved for the
second and third acts. Bar The Officer, most of the
Caulfield malcontents were expected. In Melb. Cup 98
have been committed for trial, two-thirds of which won’t
see the post. Three-year-olds will likely play a big part
this year, the majority of the oldsters being ‘incapable of
winning even if they started the night before.
* * * *
Four-mile Caulfield G.N. Steeple this Saturday
will distress the top weights if there is anything to take
them along. The erratic M.L. pair, only arriving a few
days before, were wisely scratched. Songster may hum
home safely, but never was a race so open. The best ap-
parent plan is to back a light-weight with dubious cre-
dentials, such as Tayforth or The Louth—the latter for
preference, because he has got “no possible chance.”
* * * *
If The Parisienne is to win Sam Cook his first
C. Cup she will likely be saved instead of tilting for Sydney
Metrop. with 71b. more. Also, if The Capt, has any chance
in the Metrop. with 8.3, his Caulfield prospects w'ith 151 b
less must be esteemed. But he is a nice horse to lose
m rney on. Toreador will prove a warm article for Rand-
wick if commissioned, and it only needs the presence of
Wallace and Trentham for Sydney Cup to be fought over
again.

Cabled that in a team-race Australian cyclists
Lewis, Megson and Payne, were easily beaten over one
and five miles by Englishmen.
Cyclist Parsons was to make his first appearance
on a European track at the Paris Velodrome, in a match
against time, a fortnight after the mail left. As no news
s performances have been cabled, it is safe to assume
that his try, if it came off, resulted in no record-smashing.
It is stated that Parsons has a good offer to tour the U.S.
next season.

Dan O’Brien’s luck isn’t worth a bunch of
carrots. The fine striding Loyalty has now twisted a
fetlock, and will be sent ’Ome for sale. Fat-kneed Bob
Ray is weighted out of Melb. Oup. He is not a Paris.

A Kalgoorlie dreamer has had a midnight vision
of Destiny winning Caulfield Cup. A Sydney sport
recently dreamt a grey horse won Melb. Cup. “I’ll lay
100 to 2s. 6d. that a grey won’t win,” said a bookie.
Wager accepted. There is only one grey in the race, and
he won’t start.
* * * *
Young Towns is losing many of his sculling
vagaries under Messenger’s tutorship at Double Bay. His
opponent, Neilsen, paddles his own canoe, disdaining a
coach, and is rapidly striking form. The “ Dutchy ’’ beat
Stanbury twice years ago, but wouldn’t race him now for
a box of matches. Towns, though, is ambitious, and in-
tends flying at the champion if he wins his match.

“The last time I parleyed with Gaudaur,” says
Stanbury, “ he wanted me to row him at Aurilia, in the
backblocks of. Canada; a place noted for its ice, red
Indians and things. I wasn’t taking any ice in mine lust
then.”

From a letter from one of the N.S.W. cvcling-
team now in England to a friend in Australia:—“London
is a wonderful place; an Australian doesn’t know he’s
alive until he has drunk the joy of the music-halls. There
is as much difference between Australian music-halls and
the London order as there is between wooden legs and
living ones. And the catering stuns creation ; London is
on a perfect quad when it comes to epicureanism, and
Aus. is on the bone-shaker of indigestion. I attended a
banquet given by the Simpson-chain people, and I am
sending: the menu to the N.S.W. Wheelmen’s League for
the surfeiting of their imaginations. We (Megson, Pavne,
a "d Lewis) are riding for the Rover Cycle Co. at a salary
j, j 0 a F ear ’ w Rh trainer, bonuses, and travelling ex’s
added. Carlisle, in his attempt to lower the John o’
Groats to Land’s End record, had 40 or 50 men engaged
pacing, feeding, &c.—cost £5OO or so. The cracks ride
*“• rna °hines ; gearing, 76 to 96. Pacing here is perfect;
the Dunlop Tire Co. has ten teams receiving £2 per week
per man doing nothing but pacing. We are regarded as a
good draw, and. will make money touring the provinces.
Catford track is a revelation : you bowl along its glassy
banked surface with scarce an effort.”

An old lady, residing in a Melb. suburb,
got a “ fair startler ” the other day. She was back
with her rent, and also with her time-payment on
furniture. A fortnight ago she visited Sydney ;
and, on returning, was staggered to find a vacant
allotment where her home had been. The furni-
ture-man had seized and stored the furniture to
save it from being seized by the landlord, fee said
—and the landlord, having a good offer, sold the
house, lock, stock and barrel for removal. It was
so sudden, the old lady said.

The Southern Sentinel, a quarterly
journal of serious tendencies and much unconscious
humor, calls evangelist M‘Neillto book for daring
to threaten a Divine judgment on Brassey’s yacht.
M‘Neill stated that Providence would pause the
Sunbeam to smite a rock, by way of punishing the
Vic. Governor for throwing it open to the public
on Sundays, but the Southern Sentinel denies
the evangelist’s power to work Providence in this
matter. The S.S., having ransacked the Holy
Bible for evidence of the Lord’s sentiments, con-
cerning the Christian Sunday, feels convinced
that He doesn’t wish it to be kept holy. He never
ordered it to be a Day of Rest, nor called it by a
sacred name in His Word. In short, Sunday is
not the Sabbath, and —says the occasional publica-
tion—“fearful is the responsibility of the man
who, with an open Bible before him, stands before
the people and teaches them that God is going to
destroy them unless they keep Sunday as the
Sabbath.” About 20 columns of solid reading
matter have to be waded through before this con-
clusion is arrived at. As regards what ought to
happen to breakers of the real Sabbath, the
Southern Sentinel is vague and uncertain.
Clearly it doesn’t know. Nobody knows, expept
the Deity, who omitted to lay down a law upon
the subject in His Word. Moses did know, pro-
bably, but he is dead. Moreover, there is a doubt
as to whether there ever was such a person, outside
of the Bible aforementioned. Nothing seems cer-
tain, not even the fearfulness of M‘Neill’s respon-
sibility, or theterewthof the Southern Sentinel.

mO MINING COMPANIES, BATTERY OWNERS
1 AND OTHERS.
Increase your yields by Saving the Fine Gold
and Pyrites by the use of
Wynne and Tregurtha’s
Patent Battery Plates.
This Invention, lately patented, revolutionises the ordi-
nary battery treatment of ores, for by its use copper-
plates, quicksilver, and chemicals are entirely dispensed
with. The Wynne and Tregurtha Patent Battery Plates
are made of iron, cast with peculiarly-shaped ribs. They
are fitted in a wooden frame, and take the place of the
ordinary copper-plates and blanket tables. The tailings
on leaving the stamper boxes pass over the plates which,
from their construction, catch the fine gold and pyrites,
allowing the sand and water to flow away. When the
plates are fully charged with the concentrates they are
then tilted backwards by means of a lever, throwing the
contents into a trough underneath. In practical use
much better results have been obtained by these plates
than by the ordinary copper ones, the yield of gold being
increased by fully 10 per cent. Excellent results have
been achieved in the treatment of refractory ores, where
the gold-is associated with some foreign mineral, which
has proved deleterious to the mercury and causing the
loss of the gold. The plates are strong, simple in con-
struction, and easily handled, and can be obtained from

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
A BOY AND A PUP.
He was fondling it when I first saw him. Such a
miserable-looking object —no tail, no hair, and
very little of anything else. .
It had been kicked out to die. He had dis-
covered it, and was tenderly nursing and petting
it back to life. Pity and love welled froin his
eyes. His soul gushed through them, and deep,
dumb gratitude gazed back. .
A few weeks later I saw them again. Ihe hair
had grown, and the pup was sleek and fat--oaf the
hoy was heating the pup.
TWO ANTS.
One was red ; the other black. They should have
been fighters, but seemed disinclined _to begin
when I poked one towards the other with a piece
of stick. The black was the greater coward and
ran for his life every time. I was viciously deter-
mined to make them fight, and persevered until
the red got a grip. _ n . ,
The black was getting the worst of it. W nat
right had I to force the poor wretches to torture
one another? The red pulled a leg off. The cruel
little demon was not fit to live —so I killed him.

“At the Last Moment."
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Swannage,” said Townsville, “come
found and give me a hand with the packing. Are
you busy'?
“No,” said Swannage. “I have seen all the
patients on my list this morning. But haven’t
you packed everything yet ? Why, the boat sails
this afternoon ! ”
“Oh, yes. I only left a few portmanteaux.
The res’t of my dunnage is on board by now.”
Townsville was not overburdened with remu-
nerative practice, and, with his wife and children,
was on the point of starting for a new field—Aus-
tralia, the supposed “ El Dorado ” of unsuccessful
men. ,
Old chums, these two. Easy-going, middle-
aged Swannage, with his level head, and Devon-
shire dogged good-humor, was Townsville’s
chiefest friend and confidant—next to his wife.
Poor old Swannage ! A bachelor, too, and to all
appearances likely to remain so to the end of the
chapter.
It certainly was a tug for Townsville to finally
“cut the painter,” particularly as Bessie had
never become exactly enthusiastic about leaving
“ Home ” ; (“ Home ! ” and a precarious living of
“two-fifty” a year to support two children and
“ keep up appearances ” with). But Bessie was
always “ entirely guided by Bob.” And Bob had
decided to go, and so
• • • •
“There! Now a last ‘nip/ old man.
Sit on this hat-box. We’ll both have to drink
out* of the same glass; all the others went in
‘lot 24.’”
“ Here’s luck, Townie, and to our next meeting !
Ha ! Ha ! I wonder when, and where ? ”
“Luck, Swan . If you weren't such a lucky
bargee, and so infernally popular with your
patients, I’d say ‘may it be soon.’ But as it is,
why, there’s a very small chance, eh ? I wish to
the Lord you were coming with us. Bessie’ll miss
you, I know. She thinks no end of you, Swan.”
“ Yes ? ” indifferently from Swannage.
“ I should rather think so ! D’ you know, old
chap, I was awfully near suggesting that she and
the kids should stay behind until I made things
comfortable out there ”
Swannage looked up quickly, “ Eh ? ”
“ Oh, I gave up the idea. I thought you’d have
looked after them, but, after all, it would have
been imposing too much on your good nature, and
I gave it up. It will no doubt be best to go
together; it’s all arranged now, anyhow.”
“Yes, of course,” assented Swannage.
Townsville rose and looked at his watch; “Stay
here while I fetch a cab, will you, Swan ? Bess
will be down in a minute or so. You’ll come down
to the boat with us ? We can all go together.”
“Yes,” replied the other, absently, “go
together.”
* * * *
A minute later the hall-door banged, and
Swannage was ascending the carpetless stairs. At
the first'door on the left of the dusty landing he
stopped for a second, looked at nis watch, and
entered without knocking.
* » * *
Mrs.. Townsville was looking out of the
window at the dreary prospect of suburban brick,
blurred by the rain which poured monotonously.
She did not turn as-Swannage entered. “ He has
gone,” she said, pushing her unbound hair back
from her forehead. She was riot dressed for going
out. Her hat and wraps lay tossed on the semi-
dismantled bed.
“ Yes,” said Swannage, as he walked to the
mantelpiece, and, taking a glass and water-bottle
therefrom, placed them on a small round table,
which, with the bed, made up the whole remain-
ing furniture in the room. He moved the table
near to the head of the bed. There was silence
for a space, save for the patter of the rain on the
window, and, more remotely, on the roof.
Then she turned and said, “Have you got it,
Jack ? Will he be long.? ”
He answered categorically Yes. No. About
five minutes.”
“Oh, Jack, darling, will there be time? she
asked, coming to him and showing the first trace
of emotion.
“ Plenty,” he answered. Then, filling the tum-
bler with water, he drew from his pocket a small,
fluted blue bottle, loosened the stopper, and
placed it also on the table. Then he turned
sharply. “ Bess, are you afraid ? ”
The woman smiled up in his face and shook her
head. “I was only afraid that you had not
brought it and that there might not be time,” she
said. _ , , .
“ And have you rio regret ?” he asked, his arms
round her now, and his nervous hands buried m
her thick, dusky hair.
“ Not one, love ; kiss me ! ” and she raised her-
self on tip-toe and offered him her lips, which
were steady and moist and smiling. “ And now,
she continued, gently unwinding his arms, ‘me
first, for fear ”
He moved to the table and poured the contents
of the bottle into the glass of water. There was
a sudden scent of almonds in the room.
She took the glass from him, seated herself
on the edge of the bed, and offered him her dis-
engaged hand, which he clasped in both his as he
knelt beside her on the bare, dusty floor.
(t Together now, always,” she said, and smiled
at him again; then putting the tumbler to her
lips she half-emptied it at a draught. .
He took it from her on the instant and drained
it. It fell and shivered to pieces on the floor as
their hands met once more, and then
* * * *
That is how Townsville came to alter his
mind at the last moment, and why he never went
to Australia. The last time I saw him he bor-
rowed five pounds from me. He spent it in
cocaine.

Darby and Joan: a Kodak.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A stuffy day in the Divorce Court. Three or
four barristers and a solicitor or two at the table;
behind, the usual nondescript crowd of cheap-
sensation seekers. A bronzed, pleasant-looking
man of about 35 in the box. He is the petitioner.
“Yes ! we’d been married six years. Happy?
Yes, we were known as Darby and Joan to every-
one in our district. She came up to Sydney for
the race - week —I had to stay at home for the
shearing. She remained six weeks —met co-
respondent : young globe-trotter, out here with
his yacht. One day, shortly after she returned, I
inadvertently began to read a letter that lay open
upon the blotting-pad, and realised everything.
It was from the co-respondent—he had been send-
ing her money ; she was preparing to join him. I
told her what I had learnt; that night she left—
and I have not seen or had word from her since.
She was last heard of on board co-respondent’s
yacht at Cannes.”
Then Joan’s father —a white-haired old man—
comes into the box to give some necessary evi-
dence. He breaks down and cries like a child.
More formal evidence.
No appearance for respondent or co-respondent.
Decree nisi.
And Darby ? ...
Darby went back to the station, and in six
months had nearly succeeded in drinking himself
to death —then he remembered the two helpless
little children, pulled himself together, took a
trip to Europe, and the other day married “the
sweetest woman in the world,” who is the best of
mothers to the little ones.
Darby’s all right !
Joan ?
She left the yacht not long after the divorce-
worried co-respondent to marry her—but he wasn’t
that sort. She was next seen in Paris, where her
beauty, dresses, diamonds, and her smart little
victoria were a good deal admired. She drove in
the Bois every afternoon —dined at the Cafe de la
Paix and the Maison d’Or, and was a regular fre-
quenter of the opera.
Then she commenced to age a little, and took to
laying the color on rather freely. She began to
slip gradually and almost imperceptibly down-
wards—Cafe Americain, Moulin Rouge . . . was
seen one morning in Piccadilly, in the small hours,
very dishevelled and slightly intoxicated.

Cooee!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The parson had called during the day for sub-
scription purposes and found the wife and two
little ones crying at the bedside of the dying man.
Good-hearted, earnest, old Lee administered his
usual dose of hackneyed consolation, with his
usual firm conviction of its futility, but the tears
rolling down his rugged old face made up for that.
In the presence of a death fraught with such con-
sequences to the living, it seemed blasphemy to
murmur “ God’s will.” What was to be the
future for these three when the man on the bed
had gone? Before this ghastly conundrum of
Fate he stood benumbed —the conventional solu-
tion by Faith seemed to have lost its basis when
confronted with the embodied enigma. He quailed
before this —the Inscrutable and Inevitable ; and
by sheer force of habit —prayed.
Jack lay on the bed— the wreck of a splendid
man, tossed for 20 years on the fierce waves of the
Bush, and now entering the haven of which Death
is sole pilot. His was a lingering disease, one that
the Bush breeds in its dark dampnesses, and trea-
sures up for its own particular motives.. .Sleeping
anywhere and everywhere, toiling of necessity
through wet and dry, tramping alternately the
mud-and-dust-smothered treadmill of the Unt-
Back prison, he had grown weaker and weaker,
and then : the cowardly linker struck once with
all his force, and Jack’s strife with the Bush was
finished. “Man is not made of cast-iron . Ut
this truth, the pale, sunken face, the dreamy,
wide-open eyes, the muscular arm hanging limply
over the edge of the bunk, thin and lined with
ghastly blue veins, all bore grim witness.
“What’ll Kate do, Mr. Lee ? ” he asked slowly,
“ she can’t ever clear off the mortgage on the
ground-and Nell and Will, too! Oh God
Two tears told the intensity of his suffering, told
that he saw no beacon of Hope in the Future
for those he loved. The parson whispered to him,
and a look of relief followed. As night came on
he grew delirious, and uttered hoarse-whispered
ravings, shreds of memory from the 1 ast. Still
the old man sat beside him, whilst Kate m tearless
grief moved about the house, and Nell and her
little brother slept as peacefully in the corner of
the room as if their paths in life were free from
every obstacle, strewn by merry breezes with fresh
leaves, like the bridle-track down the hillside from
the house. , , , . ,
It was near morning when the dying man awoke
from a fitful doze, with the delirium gone—so the
watchers thought by the look on his face. He
raised a finger in warning and whispered :
“ Hush ! Did you hear that cooee ?
“ No.” Then it struck the old clergyman that
it must be the fancy of a dying man.
“There’s someone lost, parson! Gant you
li6£tr ’em ? 55
The old man went to the door: “ Yes.”
‘ ‘ Cooee back, man ! he’ll find the way then.
The parson gave a low cooee, choked short with
a cough. , . , . .
“Louder!” said the dying man, half-rising.
“ Louder, parson, for God’s sake. Ain’t ye ever
been lost in the bush ? It’s just hell. That s
what did forme —out on them hills all one night
—cooeeing—till—l was fair —done up. Louder,
man ! ” He fell back on the pillow.
Lee obeyed.
“ Is he coming nearer 1 ”
“ Yes, old man.”
“ Tell Kate to get him —some —tea.
But when he came no one wanted him to stay,
and Jack went out with him.

A Coolgardie Wedding.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Let’s have another drink,” said the best man,
“She’s not in sight yet.”
The party, tired of waiting for the bride in the
heat, backed him up ; but the groom, nervously
brushing off the red dust that tinted his light
pants, refused.
“ He knows he might jib if he had another
drink ! ” was the general comment.
The church—a galvanised-iron structure —stood
on tire corner. The unlined interior showed the
sapling posts and beams, and the hessian backing
to an altar of kerosene-cases disguised with calico.
The company was more or less sober ; but the sun
was very warm. One man, through force of
habit, pulled out two pennies to start a two-up
school ; but he had just come in from Niagara,
and, as the best man said, “hadn’t the manners
of a blaekfellow.” In front was the dusty street,
with occasional whirlwinds waltzing up and down.
Over the wide area of heat-reflecting roofs the
tower of the brewery beckoned tantalisingly.
Man after man of the wedding-party made sudden
dives through variously-smelling backyards to the
bars .of Bayley-street.
Suddenly a cart turned the corner, and everyone
drew back, for in it was a coffin. The driver
pulled up at the church-door, and, utterly ignoring
the significance of the crowd, said to the bride-
groom :
“ Say, mate, give us a lift with this poor .”
The best-man explained that there wasa wedding-
party—but to no purpose. The driver of the dead-
cart said he had to “get his load prayed over,”
and hi's boss would kick up a row if he was too
long. Then the wife of the dead man and her
friends oame up in tears and put in their claim to
the church and the priest’s services. A heated
argument followed for precedence, while the driver
let one end of the coffin bump down on the path.
Between the ill-fitting lid and the sidehalf-an-inch
of daylight percolated, outlining the pinched edges
of a ghastly profile which had been jolted forward
against the lid.
“For God’s sake, man, shift back ! There’s the
bride ! ” said the best-man, pointing up the-street
where another cart appeared with a white blur of
dresses in the centre. The driver of the dead-cart
and his load were hustled into the lane, while the
bridegroom anxidusly asked whether it was fever,
and directed some one to “go for carbolic.”
Then the bride and her maids drove up. The
veils and dresses were patched with the inevitable
red dust; but thq. bouquets the ladies carried ex-
cited instantaneous envy.
“ Where did she get them lilies ?—are they lilies,
Maria ? ” whispered a feminine spectator only
lately married, who had to -be content with paper
flowers at her wedding. No, these were not paper,,
they glistened with dew, which made convincing
splashes on the dusty gloves, but no one could
recognise what flowers they were.
The party filed into the unventilated church,
which could never quite get free from the strong
breaths of the faithful, and was pervaded by an
unholy odour of tobacco and beer. The ceremony,
proceeded, the responses occasioning interruptions
by the driver of the dead r cart, who kept peeping
in and growling audibly '* W’en is this ’ere
circus going to finish ? ”
At last the knot was tied. The bride looked as
bashful as she could and took her husband’s arm
to march out, when one of the curious ladies
squeaked :
“ Lord ! I know the smell ! —they’re sliced
celery ! ”
The bride, furious, paralysed her with a look,
instantaneously resumed her bashfulness, and slid
gracefully through the sacred portal.
“ Our deal! ” said the driver of the dead-cart.

Caught on the Beach.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the spring of ’Bl, I was in Greymouth, M.L.
For a young man just freed from the heat of
North Queensland there was plenty to see and do.
The town is inconsiderable, but there is a noble
river to bathe and boat in. The bush-clad hills
and narrow limestone caves are delightful, while
to walk out along the mile-long breakwater and
watch the giant breakers rush surging in is an
experience not easily to be paralleled elsewhere.
One day old Tainui, the Maori “ odd man ” at
my hotel, started out for Point Elizabeth, a rocky
headland some six miles up the north coast, to try
a new lobster-pot he had made out of green supple-
jacks. We crossed to Cobden, an obsolete town-
ship on the north side of the Gi’ey River, and here
I foolishly gave old ' Tainui half-a-crown to get
some rum. He got the rum and carried it, walk-
ing just behind me,'and, after half-an-hour so,
:he calmly lay down by the roadside, handing over
tome with Maori gravity the empty rum bottle
and the lobster-pot and bait.
Mentally cursing the old fellow, I pushed on.
I had never been to Point Elizabeth, but it had
been indicated to me from the steamer’s deck,
so I knew I was right when, after a couple of
hours’ tramp, I arrived at a rooky island sur-
mounted at one end by a natural tower of rocks
crowned with.some tough bushes. The tide was
just low enough for me to reach the fishing pools
on the island, and in a few minutes I had baited
my trap, moored it securely in a nice deep pool,
and was quietly sitting down eating the lunch I
had brought.
1 had no lack of luck. Lobsters, or rather cray-
fish, were plentiful, and my first haul was three
beauties. I had forgotten to take the bag from
old T 'ainui; but I tipped them into a secure iso-
lated pool in the table of rock from-which 1 was
fishing. Soon I had a couple of dozen crayfish in
my extemporised aquarium, fighting and tumbling
over each other ; and, growing tired of such easy
sport, I started to explore the rest of the little
island.
Just then I discovered a curious thing. The
pool I had my crayfish in was at the foot of a
little wall of smooth rock some 12ft. high. Ex-
tending to within an inch of this wall, and in such
a position as to half cover the pool I was using,
was a huge flat piece of detached rock which, as I
clambered on to it, I found to be just on the
balance. It was, in fact, a “ rocking stone.”
* * * *
Here was a discovery. The mass was some 10
or 15ft. across, and by shifting my weight some
two or three feet each side of the centre I found I
could rock the stone to and fro iii a novel kind of
see-saw. The rocking-stone sloped sharply down
where it approached the little wall, and, going
over to examine that side of it, my foot slipped
from under me and I came bang against the wall.
The impact momentarily released the rocking
stone ; my right foot slipped in between the stone
and the wall; and, as I took the weight of my
body on my left, down came the stone again and I
was a prisoner !
I could not take my weight off the rocking
stone, for there was no crevice in the smooth wall
that rose above me to which I could cling. I
could not spring up to relieve the stone of my
weight, for my right foot was jammed, and my
left, being between it and the wall, was rendered
useless—even if the stone, instead of sloping
sharply down, had been flat enough to get a foot-
ing for a jump.
The pain, too, was intolerable. The space be-
tween the cliff and the stone was less than two
inches, and I had the prospect of being slowly
drowned as the tide rose.
Cursing my luck, I considered possible means
of escape. I had my knife, and if I could
cut away my boot I thought surely I could wrench
my foot free. I got out the knife, and, after a lot
of trouble, cut away my boot and sock. Then I
got as good a purchase as I could with my free foot,
and tugged and wrenched and tried to spring. No
use; the harder I pressed with my free foot the
greater the pressure on the rocking stone and the
tighter the jam.
So I waited and waited. My foot was, of
course, torn and bleeding, but so tightly com-
pressed as to be almost without pain. By-and-by
the tide began to come in, and I found myself
stupidly wondering how long it would be before it
reached my mouth ; and whether Tainui would
recover his senses and liberate me—or my remains.
I pictured to myself my skeleton, and wondered
whether my head would fall off first, or if I would
float off from where I was jammed.
Then I fell into a kind of dozing stupor, and
some hours must have passed, for presently I woke
to find the spray dashing over my face. Then I
discovered that feeling had come back to my foot.
Slowly I grew conscious of a cutting, pinching
sensation, and, looking through the crevices, I saw
—the crayfish were grappling and starting to eat
my toes !
The agony of that time ! I yelled idiotically
at. the brutes, forgetting they could not hear. I
tried to stamp with my free foot, and then, the
horror of the thing overcoming me, I cursed and
yelled like a maniac.
* * * *
Suddenly, during a lull in the booming of the
surf, the echo of my despairing coo-ee calne back
to me from the foothills. Tool that I was not to
have called out before, I thought; there might be
someone within range. I had lungs like leather,
and, quickened by hope and maddened by the
attacks of the lobsters, I sent out a succession of
coo-ees that fairly lacerated the atmosphere.
Just as I was on the point of desisting, a figure
appeared on the beach. I thought of Tainui, but
no ! the figure was a woman’s, and my heart sank
as I reflected that she would be powerless to help.
By this time the spray from the breakers was
flying over my head incessantly. No sooner, how-
ever, had the woman made out for certain that
there was someone on the rock than she set about
rescue. Quickly she discarded her short and
scanty costume and entered the surf. Cleverly
she breasted the rollers, taking full advantage of
the undertow and diving- through the worst of the
breakers, until she gained the rock, and came
stepping along its slippery surface.
As she neared me, I wondered. She was nearly
full-grown, her body and limbs displaying, the per-
fection of athletic womanly grace. She could not
be a Maori —or a half-caste, even—she was too
light. And she surely was not a European, for
slie betrayed no token of shame at standing thus
naked before a man.
Quickly she learned my plight, and like a Trojan
set herself to free me. She ran to the opposite
end of the stone, and, though the breakers were
now beating on it, tried to bear it down so that
my end would tilt up and release me. Her weight
was not enough, but as active mentally as she was
physically, she sang out, “ Hang out as well as
you can while I go for a sapling.”
Though every second seemed like a minute to
me, the novelty of this turn in the adventure took
my mind off the pain sufficiently to let me admire
the girl’s strength and agility. Lord, how sl e
swam ! Sometimes I would see her on the curl of
a breaker, side-arming ahead like a steam-engine.
Then, as the wave broke, I would catch sight of
her head as she shook her long hair back and
eramely breasted the undertow. Soon she gained
the shore and, wet and bare as she was, ran along
the beach out of my sight. When she reappeared
she had in her hand a tomahawk, and made across
the shingle bank into the scrub that bounds the
beach. She soon returned with a long, stout
sapling.
, How she lugged this heavy green stick through
the surf over to the island where I was ; how she
inserted the end in the crevice alongside my foot
and prized away that dreadful rock, must be
imagined, for I cannot describe it. What I know
is that she got me ashore just after dark, and, my
foot being fearfully injured (the crayfish took part
of two of my toes—old Dr. Morrice took the rest)
she extemporised a pair of crutches and took me
home to her father’s hut.
* * * *
Here, in exchange for iny own, I learned' his
history, which included, of course, that of his
half-wild girl: His name was Tregarthen—a Cor-
nishman ; had been a miner ; was a beachcomber
on the 17-mile beach. She had grown up what
Mrs. Grundy would call a regular heathen, till in
her 17th year, though she could neither read,
write, sew, or dress herself decently, and knew no
more of religion or civilisation than a troglodyte,
she could shoot, fall a tree, “ wash the black
sand, dig in the garden, and swim like an otter.
I stayed at the house until the packer brought
out a horse to carry me into town and to the hos:
pital. And now . . . now my plain-spoken
friends tell me that it was all a scheme—that I
went fishing for lobsters and caught something
that holds a good deal tighter even than a lobster
—a wife. However, as the same friends rave
about the beauty of my wife’s face and figure,' 1
am satisfied, because I, who first saw her shining
like a water-goddess on the rocks at Point Eliza-
beth, know that it is true.

NERVOUS DEBILITY
Resulting from Impoverished Blood,
Cured by the Use of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
«»
Bead the following remarkable testimony of Mrs. M. A. Helleur, of
Sussex St., North Adelaide, So. Australia, whose portrait is given above:
“Some years ago, I suffered very severely from soreness and general
weakness of the system, being so badly affected that I feared even to go
from one room to another, on account of the strange objects that appeared
to flit before me. My doctor, after treating me for some time, without
any benefit, at last recommended me to try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. I took
his advice, and am pleased to say that the effect was really wonderful.
Vigour was restored to my system, my nerves were strengthened, my spirits
brightened, and I was enabled to return to my usual occupations. I might
say that several of my friends and relatives have used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
with like beneficial results. I believe it to be the best health-restorer
that has ever been offered to the suffering masses.’’
