SATURDAY, MARCH 24, 1888.
A Brace of Blatherskites,
MR. Daniel O’Connor is a retired pork-bntoher
in Sydney. By the grace of the bigotry and Ig-
norance of the electors of West Sydney he is a
member of Parliament for New South Wales; he
was once, for nearly three weeks, a Minister of
the Crown ; and he Is descended, he says, from a
royal line. For the rest, he is what circum
stances have made him; and for that he is
not, we suppose, to be held morally responsible,
He Is an M P. because the Green and Orange fac
tions settle those matters between them in Syd-
ney ; he has been a Minister, it is said, because
Sir John Robertson appointed him ‘ ’ for a joke
and he is of royal line because most Irishmen of
his peculiar type are descended from some Irish
king or other in such reckless profusion that Irish
royal institutions have been long since brought
into undisguised contempt. This is one blather
skite. Mr Robert (likewise Burdett) Smith is
the other. He is an attorney ; but he is neither
retired nor retiring. On the contrary, he neg-
lects no opportunity, so that it be fatuous enough
for his level, to obtrude himself on the notice ot
the public. He is also a member of Parliament,
by the grace and favour of nothing or nobody it.
particular. He has never yet been a Minister of
the Crown, for he is not the kind of person that Sn
John Robertson would care to play practica
jokes upon. And, though he is not descender
from a royal line—we know of only a vice-royal
house named Smith—he has enough soapy drivel
about “ loyalty " and the “ throne,” and other be-
wildering tommy-rot of that kind, concealed
about his cherubic person to cargo a missionary-
ship.
• * *
The pork-man and the attorney-at-law are com
peting against each other just now. Mr. O’Con-
nor has been cultivating the role of a species
pf literary body-snatcher. Thucydides, Demos-
thenes, Socrates, Cicero, Kendall, and a host
of other worthies have been resurrected from their
wormy beds by this pig-sticking apostle of old
Greek culture and modern literature and taste.
The first four have been turned adrift under
names that would have served them as effective
disguises from their nearest blood relations, and
exposed to vulgar scorn as the mere creatures and
instruments of Mr. Dan O'Connor, M.P. Thh
it was to have lived ! Had they foreseen their
fate, Socrates would have drunk the hemlock in
early childhood, and Cicero would certainly
never have tun away from the bloody-minded
persons—quotation from David Gaunson—who
wanted to cut his head off. Demosthenes and
Thucydides have ceased to be anything more
than skins for this eloquent politician’s sausages
of oratory; and poor Kendall’s marble tomb is
an eleotioneering placard of Mr. O Connor to the
eeethetio electors of West Sydney setting forth
how he wants to raise a tomb to Daniel Henry
Dbhibhy,
Mr. Smith wants to trump him by a statue to
Captain Arthur Phillip. He (Smith) helued to
put up a s asue to Capt *in Cook, ana has be not
been presented by an ao miring populace with a
small silver oast of that public monument ? He
helped to put up a statue to the Quean —and did
he not drive (in a cab !) on a certain memorable
occasion along the lines of a children’s procession
and direct (from a cab !) the ceremony of the laying
of the foundation-stone of the pedestal ? Like
the tiger in the Indian jungle, he has tasted blood.
He will have more, Tne O'Connor has resur-
rected Kendall’s mem)ry. He also must have
another victim. And he ghoullshly proceeds to
resurrect someone else.
* * »
The race will ba a hot one. If one competitor
is handicapped by a statue, the other has to hump
along a tombstone. Both are fleet of foot, but
the literary pig-sticker has the advantage in the
article of grease. The Bulletin has no desire
to interfere and spoil a contest which ought to be
as interesting as a fight to a finish or a race be-
tween lady bicyclists. Bat there certainly can be
no harm in stating the conditions of the contest.
Why should Phillip get a statue ? He was
the first Governor of New South Wales—that is
to say the first gaoHr who took charge of the
Botany Bay felons. He it was who was chosen to
stamp the convict brand on Australia’s virgin
shoulder, and rend her wnite flesh with the first
strokes of she convict cat. He had the privilege
of introducing the oat and the gallows, the spiked
iron collar, the hopeless slavery of the chain-
gang, and the bloody spirit of the penal laws
that still remains to disgrace the Australian
statute-book. He personifies all that is black
and revolting—all that can disgust and sicken
the national sentiment. His name stands for
conviotism and judicial murder and Botany Bay—
for the most degrading phase of Australian his
tory and the foulest stain on the growing nation’s
escutcheon. By all means, then, let him have a
statue. We have preserved in our penal legis-
lation and in the spirit of our laws the state of
things introduced by the gaolers of the first chain-
gang. If we are not ashamed of these, there is
really no reason why Captain Phillip, our first
convict gaoler, should not have a statue which
will remind ua of that from which we have
sprang,
* * •
So much for Mr. Smith’s fad. Mr. O’Connor’s
must not be neglected. Deniehy was a man of
delicate taste, fine scholarly attainments, and of
distinct literary sympathies. Ha wrote and
talked as few men wrote and talked in this
country, at a time when people were too
busy pig-jobbing to listen to or to read
him. Disgusted and wearied with hla brutal
and commonplace surroundings, he drank
himself to death, and his brilliant intellectual
gifts fizzled out in a Bathurst gutter. He
was huddled away underground, while the plg-
jobbers waxed fat and rich, and began to talk
about Thucydides and Cicero, too. But he
didn’t, and he died. We are asked to give him a
monument because he, who didn’t job in pigs,
fizzled out in a gutter; and a successful pig-
jobher lives to ask us to give it to him ! Words
fail us here. We stop to gasp.
• • *
As there is a taint of the chain-gang about the
proposal to erect a statue to Phillip, so there
is a flavour of blood-sausages about the sug-
gested memorial to the literateur Deniehy.
The fact of the matter is that so long as the
political sentiment of the colony of New South
Wales allows itself to be expressed by such men
as Mr. Robert Smith it will continue to clamour
for statues for convict-gaolers. And so long as
the fine arts and literary culture of the colony
look only to blathering pork-butchers like Mr.
Dan. O’Connor, M.P., for recognition, the
memory of men like Daniel Henry Deniwhy
will be vulgarised every time it is touched. The
name itself has now only ludicrous associations
Tne proposals of a statue to Phillip and a monu-
ment to Deniehy are emanations from the same
class of mind, unsparingly expressing the senti-
ment of a certain stage of society.
“Liberty and law,”
Among Australian journals perhaps the most
misinformed and irredeemably ignorant upon
all matters appertaining to social reform,
and the proposed methods of Socialists, is
the Sydney Morning Herald, the organ of the
well-to-do descendants of the New South w a les
Corps of the past, but the other day a Sydney
evening paper scored the highest point in the
way of bourgeois ignorance of the meaning or
Socialism, when it attempted a review of a
London Socialistic publication “ Liberty and
Law,” by George Lacy, who was not long ag i
a resident of Sydney, and honorary secretary
of the Liberal Association of New South Wales,
besides being editor of a local journal called
the Liberal. Nothing in this review is so
amusing as the reviewer’s absolute ignorance
of the doctrines of Socialism and the theories
of Herbert Spencer. Of course, all Sydn y
press writers pretend to hold in deep reverence
all scientists of assured reputation, but how such
reverence is congruous with the policy of their
papers they do not attempt to explain. Fortu
nately, however, they do know nothing
about the tendency of modern science, so they
blunder along in blissful ignorance. The reviewer
wastes a lot of space in getting off a number of
watery jokes anent Mr. Lacys “attempt at the
refutation of the individualism of Mr. Herbert
Spencer,” under the impression, evidently, that/
Spencer is a doughty champion of the Propert J
and Defence League, and is being attacked by L
totally new brand of Socialist. The reviewer is<
ignorant of the fact that Spencer, like all men
of brains—who bell the truth about it—
who consider the problem of existence and at-
tempt to gauge the position of man in his relation
| to the cosmos from the standpoint of natural
science, is a Socialist, a far more scientific and
thorough-going Socialist than Mr. Lacy, and their
poim of disagreement is only concerning a mere
side-issue that affects nothing vital on either h»nd,
The jounialin question shouldrecollect that smaller
men than Lacy have in times past overthrown
greater men than Spencer, and the difference of
opinion is here so small as to be hardly worth con-
sidering by the broad-minded Socialist. - Mr.
Lacy is a plagiarist, but the man who attempts
to review his book, takes all his assertions as
hypotheses for the first time advanced. This
shows its qualifications for the tas it has assumed.
Lacy has borrowed freely from Hyndman, Max
Nordau, Gronlund, and from Spencer himself,
the woras of the latter being-although the
reviewer does not know it —a perfect gold-mine to
the Socialistic writer.
* * *
Herbert Spencer, in his “ Social Statics,’’
lays it down as an axiom that ‘‘every man has
freedom to do all he wills, provid d hs infringes
not the like freedom of every other man.” This
Is the bone of contention over which Lacy
harangues, but the paper can hardly desire
more eocialistic utterance from even Lacy him-
self. Indeed, La«y is the natural champion of this
paper’s owui policy as it is carried out in its own
office ; for there, certainly, Spencer’s axiom re-
ceives no recognition. Laurence Gronlund,
and, in fact, the entire school of modern German
Socialists have been laid under contribution to
produce “ Liberty and Law,” which is simply a
resume of their doctrine?, and a bald plagiarism
by Mr. Lacy of their proposed methods. There
is not an original line in the book. The whole of
it is better expressed in “ The Co-operative Com-
monwealth ” of Gronlund, an infinitely clearer
and more logical exposition of the principles of
modern German Socialism. Lacy writes, re-
peating gronlund
Individualism leads directly to Nihilism.
He then proceeds to point out that the same spirit
which is seeding to subvert authority in Russia is
under necessarily different conditions at work in
England, and straining heaven and earth to gain
its ends. Says the delightfully obtuse and illogi •
cal organ of uninformed dullness ;
How Mr. Lacy manages to ride double on paradoxes of
this description may be indicated by a brief quotation from
his book. “English Nihilism,” he says, “is promulgated in
the interests of the haves ; Russian in the interests of the
have nots. English Nihilists preach the abolition of Govern-
ment, because they believe that thereby the positions of pro-
perty and wealth would be secured and strengthened;
Russian Nihilists do the same because they believe that
thereby the position of the poor will be bettered. Both
classes as a body are animated by an intense desire to do as
they like and follow their own interests in their own way,
regardless of what misery they may brb g upon others. ’ The
parallel instituted in this case is, it must be confessed, a good
deal suggestive of that famous one between the river in
Monmouth and the river in Macedon; perhaps of the two
Mr.'LACY’s is even the more strained.
It must be confessed also that few men would
have taken so much trouble as the reviewer has
done to write themselves down a Dogberry.
The whole statement is simply a reproduction of
what can he found in any Socialistic work.
Socialism is the very antipodes of Anarchism.
The one is revolutionary and progressive, while
the other is reactionary and retrogressive. Let
us quote from Gronlund : '
The coming Revolution is strictly an evolution ; it is not a
class movement, but a growth of the whole oody politic. . .
There is a Reason in the Universe that has appointed for u*
the ro« d which we must travel, which we therefore do travel,
not by choice, not voluntarily, but spontaneously. . . .
Socialism is inevitably the next stage in our development
. . . Englishmen wbo simply want t~> ba well-icformed
ought to make themselves acquainted with this nevpAilo-
sophy— and Socialism is nodhng less than that—which is be
libved in by hundreds of our fellow-men with a fervour
equalling the enthusiasm of the early Christians. ... A
revolution by viol-noe is to Society what a hurricane is to a
ship struggling on th stormy ocean ; it is omy by herculean
efforts that we shall succeed in avoiding the rocks and bring-
ing it into the secure haven.
* * *
Laurence Gronlund shows very clearly in the
above that he regards any attempt to secure sal-
vation by force as simply a means of confirming
what he terms the ‘ ‘ present w ocial irder, or, rather,
Social Anarchy," and Edward and Eleanor
viarx Avbling, the avowed apostles of German
Socialism to the United States, put the matter
even plainer :
The popular idna of Socialism was everywhere there, as it
is still to a large extent in Engla d, one of misconception
fended on misrepr sentuiun The placing of Socialism
and its principles before the people has, ho-ever, been fol-
lowed in America, as in England, by the discovery of * vast
amount of this unconscious Socialism. Large numbers of
persm s, fiudkig at last that Socialism does not mean equal
division of property, nor the application of dynamite to
Capitalists, nor anarchy, have in town after t wn, by
hundred upon hundred, declared, “ Well, if that is Socialism,
we are Socialists ! ’’
Elsewhere Aveling says :
The mass of the American working class . . had been
grievously misled by Capitalist papers (I) ... It must
not be, for one moment, imigiued from this that the doc-
trines preached by us, as the mouthpieces for the time being
of the Socialist p'tny, were not revolutionary. To ere we e,
as ah Socialist teachings must be, of the most revolutionary
character. ‘he mistake into which the Americans had fallen
was the common one, that Anarchism is rvvoluti mary
Anarchism is reactionary, and the Socialist 1-bour party of
America, like its most recent speakers, are not Anarchists
because they are revolutionists.
It will be seen that Lacy has borrowed his state-
ment ; that it is not original, although it is abso-
lutely logical. Elsewhere Avbling strongly in-
sists upon tne antagonism existing between Anar-
chism or Nihilism and Socialism
It is hardly necessary to say that, as Socialists, we are not
Anarchists, and are, of nec-snty en irely opposed to the
methods and aims of Anarchism [or Ninilism]. It is true
both Anarchist .ud Socialist attack the pres mt capitalist
system But t e Anarchist attacks it from the individualist,
conservative , reactionary point of view, the tsncialist from the
Communist, pf. grewive, revolutionary staudp lint. The two
schools—if one can be called a school which has no dr finite
programme, no clear te-ching—have, in fact, nothing in
common. It is characteristic that the most violent attacks
made on us during our tour in 1886 were made by Anarchist
writers and speakers. The Chicago oapitalut Press warned
us to he h ang-4 aLerwehad land, d ; Herr Most’s paper
Die Fbeiheit, was for shooting us "on sight” before vie
landed.
The paper concludes its review of Lacey’s book
with taese lines :
Among his dissertations on “ Liberty and Law” is one on
the ’ ■ Liberty of the Press ” . . . From this it is
rather ;«troogly to be inferred that the new liberty which
Socialism is to bring will, if Mr. Lacy interprets its prin-
ciples aright, smack not a little of very old-fashioned
tyranny.
Perhaps the reviewer will be surprised to learn
that Lacy but echoes the words of many
Socialists in regard to the Press, which wrong-
fully usurps the position of the voice of the public,
when it is only a mere business and speculative
concern We hope, for said paper’s satisfaction,
shortly to reprint a translation from the German
of Max Nordau on the “ ibarty of the Press,”
which we strongly commend in advance to thi«
fossilised organ of middle-class ignorance*
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The lever or the lie.
The Sydney D.T. says of the recent prosecution
of a Sunday paper :
A law which would prohibit knowledge from circulating on
Sunday or any day is fit only for a community of pagans.
In England the Sunday press as a moral and social elevator
of the people takes rank with the Sunday pulpit, and the
authorities would as soon think of interfering with one as
the other.
The “ pagans ” so cheaply sneered at as the pro-
hibitors of Knowledge were, doubtles?, those poor
Greeks and Romans who were never blessed with
a newspaper and its e lightened rech'iuffe of
murders and criminal assaults and horrible acci-
dents and attacks on private character and politi-
cal misrepresentation, and glozlng over of
political mb deeds In the interests of “com-
mercial management.” No, the
poor wretches, hadn’t a Daily Telegraph!
They had to be content with a Lucian,
a Plato, an Aristotle, a Homer, a
Cicero, or a Seneca. They wallowed in the
mire of their own ignorance and went down to
the cold and silent tomb without having heard ol
any of Parkes private loans or insolvency sche-
dules, or the D.T.’s own pet crusade in the interest
of land-auctioneering democracy. But the pitiful
“gag ” about knowledge is too thin. Knowledge
is truth and the daily Press is a liar. Tne remark
about the Sunday Press of England being a moral
and social elevator which takes rank with the
Sunday pulpit is a delirious fib. The Sunday
Press of England is mainly a. police-court gazette.
It is plethoric with gunshots, hangings in garrets,
seductions, starvation, wife-desertion, stabs from
carving-knives, brains beaten out by pokers.
“ Moral and social elevator !” This is rough on
the Sunday pulpit! The truth is. the English
Sunday Press is like the Sydney daily Press—
a cold-blooded business speculation, In which
that cause is advocated which pays best.
Why does the D.T. continue to babble
about the “authorities”? The “authorities”—
even in caste-ridden England—are servants
elected by the public to give effect to its will. It
wills to have a Sunday Press, and it has one.
There is no eternal and abstract ideal involved.
The Londoners lead such lives of oppressive daily
dolness and commonplace ; they wander amongst
so much interminable bricks and mortar that
their existence becomes unbearable, so they en
liven matters one day out of seven by gloating
over a wife-murder or the slaughter by a starving
man of his seven children, followed up by his own
suicide. The reading of mere newspapers is an
alarming national trait. It is a sign of decay.
People read leading articles when they no longer
possess the ooncentrativeness essential (o the
perusal of the masterpieces of literature. They
gloat over pugilistic encounters when they
have esased to be a nation of warriors ; they
read divorce court proceedings after they have
discontinued to marry; they no longer contend
in the arena —they bet on the contest; they
become saints simply because their rakish vigour
has departed (the bald-headed man glareth at the
ballet-girl); they read novels because their own
lives are destitute of romance, and newspapers
because they are Incapable of thinking for them,
selves, and have an unhealthy morbidity for the
gruesome data!la of commonplace blood-shed aud
everyday brutality. The D.T. advocates the Aus-
tralian national sentiment. The advocacy is
futile, for the very people who read the enervat-
ing twaddle of the daily Press are just the people
in whose sickly breasts no flower of national senti-
ment could ever struggle to maturity.

The “ S.M. Herald” and Hie Mew South Wales
Supreme Court.
? he confidential relations which seem to exist be-
tween some of the political judges of the New South
Wales Supreme Court and the Tory and Foreign-
trade Sydney Morning Herald are quite a
novel thing in the histories of the Press and
the judicial bench. The way in which the
Herald bosses, as it were, the Supreme
Court and that some of the judges defer
to the out-of date Tory and Imperial organ
in Hunter-street are ■ ruly remarkable. Not long
since when the Gerald expressed its displeasure
at a judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Innes
that learned gentleman did what no other British
judge who ever lived has done, namely, he wrote
to a newspaper—the Herald— explaining and de-
fending his judgment—fur which he owed no re-
sponsibility to anyone except to hia own
conscience and the Privy Council. Such
conduct was eminently infra dig, and
and anyone would have hoped that it was unique
in the history of the British judiciary. But it
seems it is not. Mr. Justice Windeyer is capable
of showing something quite as un-judgelike as
that displayed in Sir George Innes s course of
action in the Levv-Kurtz case. Before the
judgments of the three judges who formed the
Full Court, when the appeal of Rogbrson against
a conviction for selling newspapers on a Sunday,
were delivered, the dissenting judgment of Mr.
Justice Windeyer was in the office of the Syd
ney Morning Herald, in type and printed,
Now, nothing is deemed so solemn and saored in
the legal profession as a judgment of the Full
Court. When such a deliverance is “
the judges meet in secret conclave and argue out
the points in dispute, and if they all agree, the
junior judge draws up the judgment of the Court
and submits it to another meeting of the judges.
If the members of the Court cannot arrive at a
common decision, each judge prepares his own
judgment. The only outside person (if so he may
be called) who possibly becomes aware of the
nature of the judgment is one of the judges’ asso-
ciates, who perhaps is entrusted with the duty of


out a clean copy, without erasures or
alterations, of the judgment of the Court, or of
hia own particular judge. This gentleman’s lips
are always sealed as to the import of the docu-
ment which he has copied. A reserved judgment
is supposed to be, and as an almost universal rule
is buried In the heads of the judges till they take
their seats in open Court and deliver it in public.
Now, that a judge should practically deliver his
judgment in a private newspaper office, to, we sup-
pose, an editor, sub-editor, overseer, several compo-
sitors, a couple of proof -readers and goodr ess knows
how many more people, before tbe patties to the
case or their legal advisers know anything about
It, is an anomaly which many people would re
fuse to give credence to. Imagine the possibili-
ties of such a course. It a man were convicted
of a disgraceful offence, sentenced to a long term
of Imprisonment, gave notice of appeal and was
liberated on bail, before the judgment of the
court was delivered, he might be made aware by
a friend employed in a newspaper office that the
decision of the appellate court was against
him, and he might take prompt measures to
escape from justice. This is only one in-
stance of the numerous things which might
happen if the judgments of the Courts were to be
confided by a judge to the officials of a newspaper.
The suitors have a paramount claim upon the
Court, and they should have the first and earliest
communication regarding the fate of their cause.
By disclosing the purport of his judgment in the
Rogerson case to the Sydney Morning Herald,
Mr. Justice Windkyer practically disclosed the
judgment of the Court, because his was a dissent-
ing judgment, and, of course, by inference, the
decision of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice
Owen was published in the Herald office. I
can hardly be believed that men of long expe-
rience in their profession “at home” and in this
colony, and lawyers with judicial minds like
Chief Justice Darley and Mr Justice Owen
would have given their approval to a course so
extraordinary atd unparalleled as that pursued
by Mr. Justice Windeyer. This is a thing of
frequent occurrence at the New South Wales
Supreme Court, but Roger«on’s case is the
latest Instance. We should like to know what
Chief Justice Higinbotham, ex Chief Justice
Stawbll or ex-Chlef Justice Molesworth, of
Victoria, would do if he became aware of the
fact that one of hla puisne judges had gone and
disclosed the secrets of the consultation room to
a private newspaper. Whether the practice is
approv<d of by the Chief Justice or not, it is
dangerous and improper notwithstanding.

Royalty and Items. " *•
Two ancient and moss-grown institutions, senile
with antiquity and their hides encrusted with the
barnacles of time, have recently sustained a very
hard knock. Bradlaugh has administered a
vicious stab ia the vital part of parsondom, whilst
Labouchere has taken a pot-shot at the he-
reditary ruler, and scared a point off the radiant
creature who governs by virtue of a glittering
genealogy. The senior member for Northampton
has succeeded in securing the abolition of the oath
In other words, the telief in the active interfer.
ence of Providence In the affairs of man has been
negatived by a resolution of the Legislature
There is, however, previous little gained. Man is
mai’e not a whit more truthful than heretofore,
and he is beginning to fear no longer the flames cf
hell. His reason is becoming more enl ghtened,
but his conscience is dwindling down to Euclid’s
definition of a point. Bradlaugh has irsarted
the thin edge of the wedge. Modern society is
built upon tbe quicksand of religious belief. The
church is officially recognised iu England. Bishops
vote in the Lords. Marriage is a saeprdota l
sacrament. A man is not socially born In Eng-
land until the parson attests to his existence. He
cannot hold landed property without recognising
in tithes the existence of the God of the modern
clergy. He cannot die without ecclesiastical
sanction. It is at this fabric of faith so inseparably
bound up with a belief in a personal God that the
abolition of the oath aims its deadliest blow.
Labouchere's motion —a perennial motion, by
the way—directs a b'ow at an institution logically
built upon the idea of a personal God. The
junior member for Northampton trots it out
every year, and every time it is discussed
in the Commons the influence of the hereditary
ruler Is iniared by such discussion. Royalty,
follows in the wake of aristocracy. They are but
two forms of one essence, and right atop comes
tjbe news from Europe of “A Royal Romance ” in
which a modern Gautama renounces the titles of
Royal Highness and Duke of Gotland, a yearly
allowance granted by the Swedish Diet and his
Stockholm palace, all for a girl not of the blood-
r oyal. Papers tremble over the fact that the
Crown Priucess of Sweden—whose future sister-
in-law the poor Miss Munck is to be is a
daughter of the Grand Duke of Baden, and a
granddaughter of the late Emperor William I
They neglect to state that Prince Oscar is the
descendant of an Inn keeper. That his grand-
father was a soldier of fortune, who "struck it
rich” in the train of the brigand Napoleon.
Who is Oscar Bernadotte ? The descendant of
a French elition of Crown-and-Anchor Roberts
four times removed. Yet Bernadotte. who gave
the family its fhst albeit the son of an inn-
keeper, was one ef the manliest kings of Europe
at his time, and one of its beet men. But this
knocks a hole in the theory of right divine with a-
vengeance. Talngs go along with a rush. A few
years ago people were electrified at. the marriage
of a princess of tbe blood-royal— Louise —with a
descendant of Mac lan Mohr, Nowadays, a
princess of the blood royal marries the grand-
son of a ticket-taker at the pay-hole
of a German-Jew-conducted variety show. A
queen’s or a king’s breath can make the blood
good, however, and some day when Batten-
berg’s grandson marries Miss Smith— provided
the Battenberg strain lasts until the third
generation and that modern notions of royalty
also last so long- -papers will trumpet forth
another “Royal Romance" and catalogue the
list of privileges given up by Miss Smith’s suitor :
As, for instance, Prince B atten berg's titles of
“Royal Highness” and “Duke of Australia,’’

Parliament of Great Britain and the Federated
Colonies, and his palaces of Osborne, Buckingham,

The Republic or the Leper.
The time is evidently c’ose at hand when Aus-
tralia must choose between Independence and
Infection - between the Australian Republic and
the Chinese leper. The spirit of Hung Fat is
aroused, and recognising the fact that Australia
is not a nation but a mere political anomaly a
dependency which plays at freedom, but which is
governed by England to suit Ec gland’s c:nvenl
ence, he carries his complaint to the throne, and
demands in delicately rounded periods, but still
with unmlstakeable firmness, that England sha'l
clear the way for the Chinese in the Pacific. For
many centuries, as Hung Fat points out in hla gro-
tesque characters, China held herself apart from
the world and took no stock in the outer bar-
barians, but ultimately England came along with
a bayonet, and a keg of opinm, and a Bible, and
other symbols of her hofin as and greatness, and
forced upon China a commercial treaty by which
Englishmen were permitted to trade and reside in
the Chinese Empire while Hung Fat, whe, till
then, had asked for nothing better than to
be left in pence with his dragon and
his Joss, received a similar privilege through-
out the territories ruled by Victoria. But
England itself Is far away, and the Chinaman has
no desire to go there, while Australia, which the
leper seeks to exploit, has put a poll-tax upon the
flowery man of spots, and even threatens to expel
him altogether, contrary to the custom of nations
and the obligations of international law. There-
fore Hung Fat gives notice that this slate cf
things must cease. England so d him the right to
raid Australia and New Zealand in exchange for
the privilege of flooding all China with opium,
strong drink, and degradation. England gave
him the privilege of carrying leprosy and small-
pox and kitten-soup throughout these co oait 8
that she might have Freetrade in cutlery and
shoddy at Shanghai and Canton. England autho-
rised Hung to turn Australia into a yellow hell
upon earth at Australia’s own expense, and gave
him due title to starve tbs white workman, and
degrade his existence, and beguile his daughters
into dens of infamy, and to corrupt his race until
the New World is filled with a mongrel nation,
half white and half yellow, a grotesque mixture
cf the rival images of Joss and God, and Hung
rises to point out that England must keep her word.
Australia, he holds, has no right to protest since
China has paid to England the price of Australia's
degradation, and while Australia allows herself to
be ruled by England and to bebiund by fore’gn
treaties which England concluded solely in ter
own Interests and on her own responsibility.
Hung Fat has logic on his fide. Possibly, how-
ever. the suave Mongol'an is i ot yet ready to con-
tf st the point. If he is not, he will wait and
nurse his wrath until his opportunity comes ; If
he ip. then the expulsion cf the Chinese from Aus
tralia will be the signal for retaliation ; the cry
will go out through the Celestial Empire that the
Englishman must go. and the shoddy traders who
rule Britain will rise to demand that Australia
shall be coerced into respecting the treaties
of the grand old motherland whose profits
are in danger. The crisis may be postponed, but
it is hardly possible that it can be averted. The
tearing up of tte parchment obligation which
promises to the Chinese free accss to every part
cf the British Empire would hit the nation cf
shopkeepers on their tenderest polnL When
Britain is kicked in the bank account the question
of Chinese invasion will come up for Immediate
settlement, and then Australia will have to chcose
between England and her leprous Freetrade ally
on the one hand and independence on the other.
Perhaps, on the whole, it might bo as well if she
chose in advance. England is pledged to Hung
Fat, and she has pledged Australia to Hung
Fat also. The two have become interwoven by
elaborate treaties established In the Interests of
Freetrade until, at last, it becomes difficult to teU
where Ergland ends and Hung Fat begins. And
Australia could very well dispense with them
both.

<tiieoii Victoria and General Gordon.
The gracious figurehead of our glorious Britifh
Empire has been turning her dear, old-womanly
sympathy to political account. With her stream
ing eyes steadily fixed on the next general elec-
tion, our gracious Queen wrote a letter to General
Gordon’s sister, in which s v e begged to deplore
ihe stain left on England by that singular war-
riors cruel fate. So says the cable. Nobody will
need to be reminded that her Gracious’s betc noir
— Gladstone —was at the head of the Ministry
which despatched Gordon to Egypt wi h certain
instructions, which instructions he paid little or
no attention to Had Salisbury been in power
at that particular crisis of the miserable Soudan
muddK and bad Gordon, fatalist and vielomry
ciank, cho en to be a martyr under Tory rule,
does any sane man believe that his sorrowing
Sovereign would “ deplore tbe stain left on Eng
land ?” No. But as the Grand Old Man was in
question, the Queen’s motherly heart told her that
now was an opportunity to have a shy
at him. This letter, even if dictated by
none but the most disinterested motives, would
be merely an old lady’s expression of opinion,
and not a valuable opinion at that. It has been
known for a long time that Gordon was an im-
practicable eccentric in his last Soudan expedi-
tion, actually (not figuratively) wasting bis
military genius and indomitable energy on the
desert air. Sent out as a diplomatist he carefully
placed himself and hii adherents in unnecessary
peril, and then clamoured for a British army to
come to their relief. Prompt action at home
would have saved Gordon, for the time being at
any rate ; while, on the other hand, he never
should have needed to bs rescued The very story
of his death which it spired the Queen’s letter,
shows the inconsistency of Gordon's character,
for we are told that he, who thought nothing of
cutting down helpless Arabs with his own sword,
sat quietly in a chair until a sheik decapitated
him. This same Gordon has been a wholesale
flogger and killer of Soudanese In his time, and
yet, forsooth ! he forbade his men to sboot down
the sheik and atked that their lives might
ha spared on that account. It was tbe
last splendid whim of a noble crank who had ad-
mittsd years before that only conscience prevented
him from taklrg hfs life and hastening to the
Heaven of his dreams. But so gentle and lovable
a creature was Gordon in his private capacity
that the Gladstone Ministry forbore from
“ rounding ”on him In thf ir own defence. After
he bad started for the Soudan, they heard how
he devoted his last Sunday mornirg In London to
a crazy consumption of sacramental bread and
wire at some drzen cr more different churches, it
being part of bis singular faith that the body and
blood of Christ was thereby absorbed into the
system to the ous’ingof original sin. This and
other proofs of his envoy's mind-disorder Glad-
stone charitably withheld from the country,
while the Tories raved at him as a “murderer, 1
Bah! Any s’aln that Gordon’s blood left on
England has been obliterated by that greater
stain cf Arab gore, which no Queen’d tears shall

Parkes upon Etiquette.
The Parkes Government has risen In a burst of
limitless wrath to suppress Parliamentary riot,
and to keep up the moral standard of the New
South Wales Assembly. The ceaselesr disorder
in the representative Chamber has been borne
long and patiently by an uacomp’ainlng Cabinet,
but at last a t : me has come when even this
gathering of suave apostles feel it incumbent upon
them to do something for the honou' of their

have resolved to suppress all future ungent'e-
manly demonstrations, and to institute measures
of reform which will effjotually prevent the use
of expressions that a Chesterfield could pcs.

has teen found that since the prezeat session commenced no
less than GO such disorderly scenes have occurred. On only
three occasions was a Government supporter concerned to
tte extent that he could be held responsible for the origin of
the outbreak. In the other 57 cases a section of the Oppcsi
tion is said to be directly responsible, one member offending
no less than 21 times and another 13 or 14 times. The fre-
quency cf this disorder has at length, it is said, forced the
Government to take acti ;n. The Premier himself has been
at all times strongly adverse to the restriction of the liberties
of private members, and has only consented tr move when
it became apparent that the curtailment of individual rights
was essential to the preservation cf the rights of the whole
body.

Minister Abigail, A few months ago Parkes
put that very much per shent Individual on to a
committee to enquire into his (Parkes ) con-
duct in rc the Circular Quay job, and having
unblushingly stuffed the board of inquiry with a
three-fourths majority of his own staunch adhe-
rents, and even then secured nothing better than
a reluctant verdict to the effect that he was this
time not a kna e but only a fool, he now claiira
to have been triumphantly acquitted by *‘a com-
mit! es of his entmles.” Abigail thus figures In-
differently as Parkes" s colleague, his uncle and
his “enemy," and there Is no reason why he should
not pose as his independent critic also. Bat this
Is merely a side Issue. The main point is that
Parkes has sent to Ecg'and for a copy of the
Hcu-e of Commons cloture rules—the ru’es that
were framed for the express purpose of throwing
the Irish members out if they could not be silenced,
and while they are coming he is “quietly” wa' chi ng
events. That is to say, he is stumpirg the country,
denounclngall who ditagree with him as liars, vil-
-1 jinp, thieves, and the like, howling out curses, and
shrieking forth that people who oppose his grovel
and his Bead House ought to be hanged. In the
intervals of these frenzied outbursts of rowdy
profanfi y Parkes fixes up rules for enforcing
gentlemanly behaviour in the Assembly, and when
he isn’t acting the part of a deranged larrikin, he
keeps his eye on points of etiquette and Christ!-
anity, and civilisation generally Not many
months ago Parkes himself was in opposition,

judgment on Garrett and denounced him as a

and by Roberts, the affluent gentleman frcm
the gin-mill, and amorg them all a great re-
vival of politeness will eventuate, and no one
will be allowed to answer back when Parkes
curses him. As for the old man himself, the rules
for the suppression of disorder do not apply to
biro. All his life long he has alternately abused
everybody, blasphemed at everybody, and bor-
rowed money from everybody, and then when he
has been asked to square up he has rounded on
his obliging creditors and abused them again, and
followed them over the country to heap insult
upon them. He would wither away beneath the
fetters of ordinary courtesy and ordinary gram-
mar, and when he introduces the new regulations
for the promotion of common civility he will prob-
ably ask to see the blanked liar who wants to op-

The Troubles of a "Hank."
A week or two ago the Honorable Francis
Abigail s “ bank ” ran against a snag, and had its
feelings trodden on. The institution over which ’
Abigail— Minister of Mines in the Pahkes Go-
vernment, Christian, patriot, boss-usurer, and'
exponent of political and personal honesty—pre
sides was virtually charged with having cleaned
out the property of an unfortunate client
under a bill-of-sale which had been altered
and manipulated after signature so as to
cover goods which were not in the original con-
tract, and the uncertifloated insolvent whom
Messrs. Abigail, Hurley, and Co. had hired to
conduct their financial operations shuffled and
equivocated in his efforts to explain away
these damning accusations, and ate his
own words and went back on his own
handwriting, and made a pitiable spectacle
of himself and his employers. Judge Stephen
summed up the ease by stating that the
alternative lay between gross perjury on the part
of the plaintiff, Pombart, or gross swindling on
the part of the “ leaving-shop ” presided over by
Abigail, Hurley, and Co., the said swindling
being carried on for the -financial benefit of
Abigail, Hurley, and Co., and perpetrated by
the man whom Abigail, Hurley, and Co. had
hired to conduct their more than Semitically
usurious business, and to trade on the poverty
and hunger of those whom misfortune might
drive to the door of their gilded fly-trap—
a fly-trap, we may remark, “incorporated
by Act of Council.” The jury accepted
the latter alternative, and, by their ver-
dict. I nelc Abigail and his pais were virtually
declared to be men who profited by frauds of (he
vilest description perpetrated by the uneertilicated
insolvent who acted as their deputy. A brief
notice in a daily paper afterwards announced that
the Unhappj manager was no longer connected
with the institution, hut if the two political
uncles of New South Wales wisli to clear their
characters and prevent their very names becoming
a disgiace to an already degraded Legislature
they must do something more than merely get rid
of the conductor of their fly-hlown institution
after he has been fount out. According to Pom-
kart’s story, which a jury of Abigail’s
country men, who had heard the evidence, chose
to accept as sufficient, lie was sold up for a
liability which was partly real, partly sham, and
partly exorbitant interest; his furniture, which
he alleged was not covered by the mortgage, was
seized to the last stiei and sold for a song ■ and
his house was cleared out, even his dead wife’s
picture being carried away with the rest, and he
and his children were left to sleep on the hare
lloor iu an empty building l . Then the ex-solicitor
of the company went back on it and declared that
his name had been inserted on the back of the
bill-of-sale without his authority, that lie had
never prepared the document or been connected
with it in any way, and that he knew nothing
about it until it was handed to him in
the witness-box. This alone almost amounted
to a charge of forgery, complicated by
false pretences, and at this stage the
question naturady arises, whether the front
of the paper was in any way more reliable
than the hack. _ The hinder part of the document
which Abigail’s bank had found so profitable
having been so strangely manipulated what was
the other side worth ? The manager himself, being
driven into a corner, admitted that the t wo guineas
cha god to the victim of > higailian fimnee for
legal expenses was one of those financial myths
of which the Hebrew is so fond, and that the
amount, instead of being paid to the invisible legal
adviser, was reverently added to the takings of
the pawnshop; and despite the virtuous outburst
of indignation which led the alleged “ Bank,” after
these disclosures, to ihakc off the servant whose
clumsiness had led to so many awkward facts
becoming public property, no one has yet
risen to deny that had it rot been exposed in
open Court , the “ bank,” whereof Messrs.
Abigail and Hurley, statesmen and guar-
dians of the public morals, are directors,
would have taken the proceeds and ea J d
nothing. As usual, every possible effort has been
made by the Freetrade Press to smother the
disg'ace of these proceedings. The Sjdncy
dallies wh'ch publish long reports with four cro s-
headings when a Protectionist member gets into
a difficulty with the law, disposed of the case in
a few lines and omitted all the ugly deta Is of the
evidence and the scath ng comments of the iud'g

“Widespread Sympathy
“Expressions of sympathy are being received in Berlin
from all parts of the universe.”— Sydney “ Evening News"
cablegram.
On his bier of proud imperial abate lies a dead
emperor, the erstwhile ruler of a fractional part
of this earth’s surface —dotted so thickly with the
graves of unknown potentates, and hoary with
dynasties whose memories and whose names are
lost In the pallid mists of antiquity. Hard by, In
apartments heavy with the trappings of imperial
woe, and sombre with the funereal vestments dic-
tated by the etiquette of official grief, sits a living
emperor—in a world weary of the contentious
clash of crowns. And with this mar,
this wearer of the purple, according to the
grovellers of the press, the universe is actually en
rapport in bitter sorrow and sympathetic condo-
lence. When Corydon complains of Amaryllis—
In the conceit of quaint old-time pastorallsts —the
sun darkens, the birds cease singing, the dowers
close their petals, the trees sigh sadly, and Nature
weeps in unison with the feelings of the love-lorn
swain. But Nature is only a phase, albeit an
eternal one, of the earth with which we are ac-
quainted. With the Emperor of Germany, the
“ Universe” is chief mourner for the late tyrant
of Teutondom. The late William was the ruler
of Germany ; Germany is a little bit of the little
earth. Civilisations have ebbed and lapsed upon
that tiny planet. Three cities o’ertop each other
in the strata of a hill near Zanzibar. The
savage fastnesses In the interior of continents
are covered with the marble language of the past,
language which no man can decipher but eloquent
in their frozen silence of the multitudinous life of
bygone cycles. Tombs and temples are scattered
over the surface of the world, Proud Imperial
palaces, with their vaulted solitudes thickly
scribed with the hieroglyphs of an unknown
tongue, rear their time scarred walls in the desert,
and the banqueting hall of a monarch becomes
the sculptured lair of beasts of prey. No man
knows the antiquity of the earth. The life of
the individual of to-day is the life of the
parasite of a molecule. Of the millions upon
millions of the mighty dead ; of the many
millions of the swiftly-passing present, of the
great unnumbered myriads of the dawning
future what space upon the point of a needle
would be occupied by a single human soul ? And
as man’s life is to the total life of the earth, so Is
the earth, and less, in relation to the universe.
Miles upon billions of leagues of miles across the

Charily Or no Charity.
Dear Bulletin,— l see in The Bulletin of Feb
11th a very pathetic appeal from a gentle
man in England to the inhabitants of the Aus
tralias for help for the starving, workless tollers
of England. Now, s’r, I have to Inform your cor
respondent that I consider myself a true philan
thropist, and that if one penny piece would save
all those men from starvation, I would not give
that penny, because their calamity is one that
they have brought upon themselves —their miser
able condition could very easily be remedied by
turning every foreigner out of England. If the
English Government would do this, they would
do the wisest thing that ever they did
since Britain became a nation. Then you would
hear no more of that distress of ths British work-
ing classes. But if a man takes the bread out of
his own mouth, and leaves his wife and family to
starve, what pity is there for him? How Is
ever the amelioration of the working classes to
takeplacslf, as soon as a thousand Englishmen
emigrate from the country, a thousand foreigners
take their place ? The Imbecility of cosmopoli-
tanism has taken hold of the English mind. True
philanthropy begins at home. If nations, like
individuals, will do everything contrary to com-
mon sense and reason, they must be prepared to
accept the consequences. Individuals frequently
engender diseases that exclude them from hospi-
tals and infirmaries simply because these diseases
could have been easily avoided, and they have
gone into their graves with more scorn than pity
depicted in the faces of the mourners. As with
the individual, so with the nation ; from acts of
folly its affairs become more and more compli-
cated until confusion, doubly confounded,
ends its councils and overwhelms it in ruin.
And this is inevitable until such time as a nation
acts consistently with reason according to the
laws of Nature. Lab England expel foreigners
until the distress of her own people is relieved. Ib
is easy enough to Invite them back when the
working man has more than he can do.—-Yours,
&c, ,• John Shepherd the Englishman, Queen-
ton, Charters Towers, North Queensland, Feb-

Tor ilie Sake of the Savage.
The Sydney D.T., which was born in a homily
and cradled in a sermon, arises to explain how
very unnecessarily cruel the wicked G irmans are
to the poor, inoffensive Samoan natives, who
never did them any harm:—
Numerically, the English-speaking residents of Samoa
are stronger than the Gsrmaus, and they have been really
the pioneers of settlement and the mainstay of government
there. Yet, notwithstanding this, we have had the spectacle
during the past few months of a German raid on the native
Government, followed by the deportation of the king and
the setting up of a new ruler to be a puppet in the hands of a
German trading company.
Then the D.T. ceases its little wail over the for-
tunes of the Begums and Nizams of S'amoa, to
bring in, as a sort of refrain, the motif of its pee an
against unscrupulous Teutondom
English interests were contemptuously ignored and the
native racss have bean practically laid under tribute to keep
in power a German vassal
But the spirit of justice and philanthropy, pity
and magnanimity, inspires the writer’s bardic
soul, and he soars into a wild chant anent the
wrongs inflicted by this commercial German
sausage of a trading-firm on the susceptible and
impressionable dusky children of nature. Ruin
seize thee, ruthless masticator of the sauer-kraut
of cold inflexibility :
Only last November a levy was made upon the natives for
the payment of a tax amounting to something like 20,003
dollars. Now we learn that another levy is to be made, this
time for a total of 47,000 dollars. This simply means that
the impoverished native land-owners will be driven to seek
the aid of the German firm by mortgaging their lands in
order to pay the tax. By-and-bye another tax will be levied,
and then will come the day for the foreclosure of the
mortgages and further tracts of rich country will pass into
the hands of this great octopus-like German trading firm.
This Is a cold, cheerless world; yet, after all,
life can be endured patiently enough when one
reads such fine outbursts against tyranny and un-
bridled license. But just here, unfortunately, the
moral editor was called away to run over the
fashion items, and a scribe, whose sordid sonl had
iusb been gloating over a rise in hides and a fluc-
tuation in the tallow market, seized a common-
place quill, and took up the music, in the same
article, in quite another key :
Nobody can blame the Germans for thus acquiring the con-
trol of this rich island territory, but what is to he said of the
supineness of the British Government which thus allows this
important island to pass into the control of a foreign Power
in deliberate, if not direct, contravention of an international
treaty ?
So it ultimately transpires that the only injustice
involved is in the nationality of the robber ! Had
he been an English brigand instead of a German
pirate, all would have gone well, and the lion of
British interests would have lain down with the
lamb of sacrifice, and clasped the claw of the eagle
of spoliation. But still all fs not lest:
Fortunately, there is some prospect of the United States
Government taking steps to protect the interests of its citi-
zens in Samoa, and possibly English interests may be thus
indirectly conserved.
And this is commercial morality ! After this we
piously yield ourself up to the tender mercies of
Coffee Calcali, and regard Tippoo Sahib as a
philanthropist of the first water. And yet we
cannot believe that Mr. Pulsford, the commer-
cial editor, read a proof of the above item. His
Freetrade principles would never hav? allowed
him to pass it, More than ever are we beginning
to understand how Abigail Is quoted as a Chris-
tian and a boss usurer, and what a lot of mercy
and human brotherhood there Is in 200 per shent
on a blood-sweating loan to a necessitous work-
man.

Ireland’s Friends and SI. Patrick’s IGv,
At the St. Patrick’s banquet in Sydney, last
week, the commonplace was unrelieved by a
single memorable utterance or a solitary sentence
above the stereotyped Hlberniclsms which one
ever expects as the unvarying concomitant of the
17 th March. The catering was poor, the speeches
were poorer still. The Mayor of Sydney took the
chair, Sir John Robertson sat not far from
his right hand, and hard by sat the ‘ 1 Castle ’’ Car.
dinal. Parkhs was not there. He ssnt an
apology. Ha did not, he said, appreciate the
need of celebrating St. Patrick’s Day in Australia
at all. Last 12th July—or the 12bh July pre-
viously—he attended the meeting celebrating St.
Boyne. One cannot serve G:een and Orange.
Francis Habigle, in acknowledging receipt of a
ticket sent him, wrote: “ I Beg to respectfully
Decline this Invitatin.” The toasts were maun-
dered through in a very ragged fashion. Mr. J,
P. GARVANgave “The Day we Celebrate,” and
ploughed laboriously through the first verses of a
number of poems familiar to the children who use
the Irish National School-readers. He had
nothing new to say, and his speech slid into the
usual old bombast about all the great men Of
every country under heaven being either
Irish immigrants or the sons of Irish
immigrants. Next Mr. F. B, Frbehill took
up the weary tale and endeavoured
to discourse on “ Ireland a Nation,” by doing a
huge mental salaam to the “ Empire," and dilating
upon all the British generals who were Irish, and
the American generals who were Irish, and all the
nondescript people who ever did anything who
were Irish, forgetting, although Wolseley and
Roberts, like Wellington, may have hailed from
Erin, that neither is of Milesian blood, and that
each belongs to that class, long hated in Ireland,
to which Dean Swift, gave the name of the “ Irish
Englishry." The lately-appointed Upper House
member “Dick” O’Connor, a N.S W. native,
gave the “ Land we live in,” and sacrificed largely
to the spirit of flummery and squirm. He said
that
Within the memory of all New South Wales had at one
bound Jumped from the position of being a mere colony to
that of being a national portion of the British Empire, and
;hat was due to the genius and the courage of one of Irish
oirth and Irish parentage who happened to be at the helm
of state when tlia Smdin contingent was sent to Africa,
Those were men and moments that turned the destiny of
natrons.
This is the sort of drivel that calls upon the world
for sympathy. These worshippers at the shrine
of St. Jingo are the Irishmen who claim Wolfe
Tone and Robert Emmett for countrymen !
When the national cause of Ireland—a cause, be
it said, by no means incompatible with the in-
tegrity of a properly-governed British common
wealth —Is in some esoteric manner connected
with the Imperialistic twaddle ladled out by the
sai-disant friends of a movement to which certain
individuals conspicuous among them never give
their open support unless it is “coming,” it is
about time to hide behind the curtain.

The fast increasing volume of German trade is
beginning to create something approaching a
panic in England. Between the years 1875 85 the
German commerce with Spain increased 1538 per
cent; with Portugal 218 per cent; Roumania, 200
per cent; Canada, 250 per cent; Cape Colony,
800 per cent; British India, 360 per cent; and
Australia, 1250 per cent. In the same period the
British commerce with Spain fell off 38 per cent;
with Portugal, 19 per cent; with Roumania, 21
per cent ; Canada, 20 per cent; Cape Colony, 5
percent; Australia, 1 per cent. More than half
the German increase is gained in dealings with
British colonies, and in addition to securing the
commerce of these lands the Fatherland is begin-
ning to compete in the matter of passenger-traffli
also. Only a few days ago a ‘ ‘ Domainer ” dropped
in at The Bulletin office in search of employ-
ment. He had been in Australia only a few
weeks, he explained, and had come out from
Southampton by a German steamer at a cost of
£i2 10s. only ! For this sum he had, he said, re-
ceived “first-class” diet, quite as good as on
any of the British lines where the charges are
some 30 per cent higher, and the vessel was
crowded with passengers. It is the old story of
Freetrade and free competition—the great
doctrine of commercial evolution—the survival of
the cheapest.

Said Premier Parkes, the other day
Those people, despite their sufferings, never forgot their
s if-respect and obedience to the law; and this was the spirit
observable in the British working-man—the true type of the
British working-man all over the world.
Parkes, who was himself a j ourneyman button-
maker who pulled his forelock to the squire, here
gives a faithful picture of what the labourer
would be if he (Parkes) had the making of him.
The sternach of the Parkes made working-man
would be permanently out of order because its
owner considered his victuals too good for It. He
would always approach a G.C.M.G. with a mental
supplication to be kicked. The workman, accord-
ing to Parkes, G.C.M.G., may perish, but he
must not complain. Why twaddle about self-
respect and obedience to law in face of the fact
that the only value, the only thing worthy cf
respect in any law, the only thing which sane tides
any law, is its adaptability to the needs of the
people who make it ? Parkes is trying to make
out that law, as law. Is above its origin. He
wishes us to believe that it contains tome divine
principle which entitles it to be unquestioningly
bowed to. No stream ever flows higher than its
source.
Dr. Schwarzbach, of Sydney, who Is
socially most popular, was last weak, prior to his
departure for Europe by the Zaalandia, presented
by about fifty ladles with a gold chronograph and
chain. It Is needless to sta f e that the doctor is a
bachelor. And on Saturday night last, Dr. Riede-
waldb, who during his ten years’ practice in Syd-
ney has earned the esteem of his fellows, and who
Is now returning to his native land to spend the
remainder of his days, was entertained at dinner
at Paris House by his Danish compatriots. There
was no nonsense about the dinner given to Dr.
Rledewaldt —It lasted seven solid hours.
Here is an item of Australian history
dating from b afore the era of legalised free-selac-
tion-before-survey. Major-General Sr Thomas
Brisbane surrendered tbe government of NS.W.
on Ist December, 1825, and 18 days afterwards
General Ralph Darling of pious memory ocsup'ed
the colonial throne as Governor over some 35,000
people, nearly one-half of whom were transported
coavic s. In the interval which elapsed between
the departure of one set of gubernatorial officials
and the arrival of the the Cha’r of State
was temporarily filled by Colonel Stewart of the
3rd R agiment—Bo fife — aid the Colonel being a
Scotchman determined to make hay while the sun
shone. Hs went out West on a prospecting
tour and perched himsdf npon the point of a
mountain spur overlooking the noble Macquarie
and the vast expanse of the Bathurst plains
This spur, which is now known as Mount Pleas-
ant, overlooks the splendid mansion of the
Stewards, and one of the loveliest of Australian
landscapes. Coloael Stewart was, for the lime,
monarch of all he surveyed—his right there was
none to dispute. So he allotted to himself the
broad lands beneath and round abouh as far as
his eye could reach. Those who know the
country will estimate its bsauty and its value
correctly. He returned to head-quarters with the
consciousness of having done his duty to Mm
self, if not to his country and his King.
When the lawful occupant of the Colonial throne,
and the duly authorised representative of Eng-
land’s Majesty arrived and heard of this gigantic
attempt at free-selection, he laid a ruthless hand
upon the proposed appropriation, and cancelled
the “grant,” giving, however, to the military
selector, as a salve, a “grant” of 15,000 acres of
magnificent country, with a boll frontage to the
Macquarie River, and running back a distance of
nine miles. This magnificent property is still
held intact by the colonel’s son, as the old man so
fixed it that it cannot be broken up and sold
There is a legend to the effect that the Acting’
Governor, in granting the land to the colonel,
made a bargain (he, as the representative of the
Sovereign, with himself, and the colonel and
selector; that he was to hold the lands as
long as he occupied them, and to keep this
bargain he determined to be burled upon
the property, and had the immense vault
excavated in which his remains are now deposited
and above which has bean erected a splendid
obelisk, whereon are detailed the virtues of the
defunct. It took 21 bullocks to haul the coffin
and its contants up the steep point to the vault
the same spot where years before this gallant son
of Mara sat and devoured, with covetous eyes
;he beauties of the landscape, and annexed for
himself and his descendants for ever this splendid
portion of the people’s heritage.

Fielding’s romance of T. Jones has
undergone a lot of editing at the hands of Robert
Buchanan, and in offering it to a discriminating
public under the name of “ Sophia," that gentle-
man does nothing to bring a blush to anybody’s
damask cheek. The boozed ancestors of the
British nation have been toned down a good deal,
and though they cuss a heap they do io in accents
comparatively soft and low. They are a shade
less horsey and a trifle less doggy than they were
in real lire, and though the Squire, on the stage,
in the person of D Eoucioault, junr., claims
the right to “smell as he likes in his
own garden,” he doesn’t carry out the threat,
whereas the original Squire would have
smelt, and his beery odour would have been
the gaffer perfume of the habitable globe.
His sentimental allusions have been smothered in
places, and the dramatist mercifully makes him
choke when he shows signs of becoming immoral
In his remarks. He curses with his legs rather
than his head, and when he grows irrepressible
he is gently led away by the coat tails, and the
low rumble of his observations dies away in dim
distance. The weakest feature in “ Tom Jones ”
is that half a hundred dramas have already
been cadged out of the story, and conse-
quently “Sophia" seems to have been born old
and stale. Io was Fielding who first conceived
the idea of the wallowing parept who won’t let
his daughter marry the man of her choice under
penalty of being pounded with a fence-rail after
she had grown up, and other men have looked
upon the idea and borrowed it and then slid down
the tracks of literature and passed it off as their
own.. It was Fielding who first constructed the
elevated young man who lives on charity and
goes away from home on high moral grounds, and
then proves too noble in his principles to earn a
cent, and sinks till he Is found washing his shirt
in a garret; and Fielding's successors have taken
the loan of the young man and made him more
elevated still, and caused him to leave home on
still higher moral grounds, and have tried to go
one better by leaving him without either a garret
or a shirt. For years and years that young
man has appealed to the h'gher instincts of a
sinking nation of lost souls, and has grown
more unable to earn his living every time, and at
last a generation that Is dead to all soulful emotion
has got quite tired of the young man Bllfll has
been cadged, too, and has turned up on the stage
as a book fiend, a missionary, an ancient Roman, a
whaler, and a small girl successively ; and under
all these disadvantages “ Sophia,” which is a good
comedy after all, unjustly appears like a copy
of “ Our Boys," strewn with the dead leaves
of the old t quire’s shabby stupidity. The com-
pany, however is as potent as an elephant, and
things go well. Mr. Titheradge is meekly comic
as Partridge, and under his fostering care that
depressed head of poultry is sublime, Mr. Cecil
Ward rather overdoes Tom Jones, but that shift-
less drinker isn’t much cf a character at the best;
a man can’t live by striking noble attitudes, any-
how. Phil. Beck looks strikingly natural as
Bllfll—we will leave him to take this compliment
home at night and sort it out; and Mr. Geo. Lash
Gordon gets less appreciation than he deserves for
acting on the Square. Miss Myra Kemble and
Mrs. Robert Brough take the rest of the laurels
It is difiicult to choose between them, and no
power out of Tophet will induce us to comm it
ourselves on this point. We wouldn’t do it for a
public-house.

dency to make long speeches In damp caves he is
a noble cavalier, who alwajs brings down the
house as he slithers through Innumerable perils.
He has many narrow escapss from Abraham’s
bosom, but ho dodges the front part of the
ancient patriarch with marked success. Messn.

van Bryan Flanigan, Mickey O’Neil, and O’Hau-
nahan Michael Dooley were looked after with the
same ability which characterised Biddy Murphy,

Professor Kennedy, dealer in magic and
spells, catalepsy and raw onions always on hand,
opened his show at Sydney Opera Home on Satur-
day night, and having called up 14 volunteers he
reduced about 8 of them to a state of crylrg idiocy
and made them go on puffectly hawful in the pre-
sence ot a large audience and a committee of two.
(The proceedings were eminently satisfactory in
many respects, but not even the Moral Law and
the Ten Commandments, with the Lost Tribes of

state that we asked 11 different open-mouthed

of the committee, and not one of them had
ever seen that enlightened body before. Fnrther-
imore, It would be more satisfactory to the full-
grown taxpayers of New South Wales if there was
a fresh crowd of subjects every night, so that, sup-
posing a man threw a meat axe on the stage on
six successive evenings, he might not run the risk
of hitting the same lot six times over. In offering
these two terse observations we have no intention
of disparaging the Professor's skill. We candidly
admit that we have tiled mesmerism our-
selves In the seclusion cf private life, aud

show, and even if the unhappy incident which
broke up our mesmeric career should be repeated

away. We tried to smooth things over on the
theory that the nervous system had been suddenly

Miss Blanche Lewis writes to a Melbourne
paper, “emphatically denying’’ the report that
she is about to be married to Mr. Grattan Riggs,
and we rise in a spirit of brotherly remonstrance
to ask her why is this ? Kven it she isn t going to
be married to Mr. Riggs why should she be so
needlessly emphatic about it, and for that matter
why shouldn’t she marry Mr.
Riggs 1 If we were in her
place we would do it. We
ask Miss Lewis in a gentle-
manly and affectionate spirit
if there is anywhere a better-
heartedold warrior than Grat-
tan, or a man who would
better fill the bill as a luvln’
husband ? We urge her to con-
sider the noble aspect which so
eminently fltshimtobe a thing
of beauty and a joy for ever. We draw her atten-
tion to hia ponderous intellect and his stupendous
grasp of facts, and we point out that Grattan
Riggs not only knows everything that has ever
happened, but a lot of things that never happened
at all, and never will. In the pursuit of hia pro-
fession he has won the public esteem equally as
an old Irishwoman selling fruit and as a Chinese
dog-pie vendor, and he has cast a halo of chival-
rous romance over the figure of an aged nigger
selling hot clam-soup. In private life he is
of an affectionate disposition and fond of
cats. Under these circumstances we feel our-
selves called upon to give Miss Blanche Lewis a
chance to reconsider her decision,

“ The Road to Ruin,” referred to in last
week’s Bulletin as a “ good old comedy," filled
Melbourne Royal on Saturday. The world has
become wiser since Charles Warner first figured
in this ancient work, and the Royal company
isn’t so uniformly strong as that which appeared
at the London Vaudeville, therefore the “Road
to Ruin ” doesn’t soothe one’s weary spirit as it
did aforetime. A very thin yarn is stretched over
five short acts, chopped up into front scenes and
scenes proper, so that, what with curtain-dropping
and shoving on of scenes about a yard back from
the footlights, the gallery boys waxed derisive on
Saturday night. Banker Dornton Is the doting
but angry father of a Charles Surface kind of son
—a young man who is frequently drunk, con-
stantly “ doing in ’’ thousands (which the firm has
to pay) at poker, and eternally protesting love for
the dear old dad he is bringing to ruin. When
Dorm on and Co. are on the point of bursting up,
the noble Harry gets particularly drunk, and tel's
a giddy widow that he’ll marry her that night if
she will give him £50,000 to save dear dad. The
widow bites freely at this vision of con-
nubial bliss, and gives Harry £6OOO down on the
nail, but instead of taking the ready to his dear
dad Harry uses it to redeem a stone-broke pal
from a debtor’s prison, which is Intensely noble,
but very inconsistent. After this things get
very mixed, A flash cad named Goldfinch is goicg
to marry the widow, with the assistance of a
lawyer, who has prigged her late husband’s will,
but the pathos of this situation was marred by the
audience bolting off to catch their trams. In
the meantime old Dornton hadn’t been
ruined, because his partner Sulky had found
a million or two at the critical mo-
ment, and Harry (nob yet quite sober) finishes
up by taking a pure young Sophie to his gene-
rous heart. The stone-broke pal is also made
happy somehow. There is a lesson to be studied
from plays like “ School for Scandal,” “Road to
Ruio," and “Sophia,” viz , that the heroes cf last
century never attempted to do a day s work. Mr.
Charles Warner somewhat overacted the part Cf
Harry Dornton, and so piled up the agony that it
was, at timer, hard to analyse his excitement.
But he will improve on Saturday’s performance
when somebody tells him that hysterical affection
for dear dad Is not one of the customs cf this
country. Mr. H. Vincent was thoroughly good as
old Dornton, and Mr. Alfred Phillips put a fair
amount of go into his Goldfinch Mr. Clltheroe
scored heavily as the wicked lawyer, and
Messrs. Anson, Flemming, and others were
all there. Those who remembered Sophie
Larkin as the Widow Warren could only
turn away and weep from Miss Flora An-
stead s burlesque of an all-important character,
nor was Mr. Warner’s pretty young daughter a
very successful Sophie. It was this lady’s second
appearance on any stage, and her voice is still Of
the infant-phenomenon order, but she has an art-
less natural style which looks promising. Without
strong female talent it Is not likely that “ Road to
Ruin " will catch on like “ Drink.” When it had
a long run in London, Mr. Warner’s colleagues
were William Farren, David James, Thomas
Thorne, and Horace Wigan—all well suited to
their parts. Inimitable Miss Larkin played the
widow, and for Sophie we had Amy Fawsitb, a
talented woman who loved the wine when it was
ruddy, and died miserably in Kew York.

It is said of a certain lengthy actress well-
known in Australis, that she hovered over the
beds of her dying male friends like a corpse-light
dancing over a grave. No man she visited re-
covered ; bar attentions to the sick were taken as
warnings to prepare for the Icy mausoleum, and
the patient who heard her footstep outside his
door trembled and froze to his marrow, and said,
“ Lo, here is the eagle !’’ She gloated over the
couch of the patient, and revelled in the morbid
ioy of bidding Impressive farewells to those who
tottered at the edge of the tomb. And now we
read of Sara Bernhardt that “ when she was once
studying for a new play In which she was to die
of consumption, she frequented the consumption
wards of the Paris hospitals. One day, as she
was passing through one of the rooms, a dying
and delirious woman rose to a sitting posture on
the bed, and, shaking her finger at Madame Bern-
hardt, she cried, * Look there ! There comes that
dreadful woman. She is death itself! Wherever
she goes we die I Whenever she looks at one of
us that is the end I Take her away I Take her
away !' And with a shriek, she fell back dead.
The actress did not again visit the hospitals."

Glaorge Coppin, in the days before he

to get out of bid on the stage, and this conduct on
his part always created a thrill of wild expectancy
among the ladies of the audience. It was in
“ Milky White," where George appeared as Daniel
White, a virtuous milk-vendor, who was much
troubled by the awful way the hoys dropped dried
rats into his water-butt. The curtain would go
up and reveal Daniel in bed, where he would lie

Professor Kennedy, the Sydney Opera
House mesmerist, tests his insensible subjects by
driving a needle through iheir cheeks. What the
public want to see now is the needle that would
go through the Professor’s cheek. Or the hatchet
either. They were playing “ Macbeth,” and there
were only five people in the company, all told.
Macbeth bad to play Macduff also, and they had
oome to the last act. “ Just you string your
speeches and Macduff’s together till you come to
the fight, will you? said the manager, “ and per-
haps in a minute or two I’ll be able to spare one
of the witches to kill you.” Ballet-master to fair
applicant for an engagement: “A*e you accus-
tomed to tights?” “Oh, yes, sir; I have been
married five years, and my old man has
never been sober once the whole time.” Hengler,
the circus man, died worth £lOO,OOO. Mr-
Carrie Swain is a large holder of Broken Hill
stock?. We hate bloated capitalists. The latest
comic song has the pathetic refrain, “Oh
mother, keep my bull-pup from the sale.”
Goethes great drama has been parodied under
the name of “Dr. Fanst and Miss Marguerite,"
and that parody of a prince, Tummy, expressed
himself delighted with the clumsy desecration.
A dramatised version cf Fergus Hume’s novelette,
“ The Mystery of a Hansom Cab," published In
Melbourne a year or so back, was to be produced
at London Princess’s last month. James Fer-
nandez, one of the most useful actors living (and
they are of little or no use when dead) had been
engaged for the show. Playing “ Fanst ”at Bos-
ton, Henry Irving realised £2OOO in two matings.
When running the Queen’s Theatre, London,
Labonohere one night found himself suddenly ex-
posed to the gaze of the audience In his ordinary
dress, the curtain having risen ere he had
time to get behind , the scenes. Rising
to the occasion, he struck an attitude, and,
waving his hand majestically, exclaimed: “We
shallmeet again,” and vanished through the wings.
Actor Lester, late of Minnie Palmer’s crowd, has
lost an action against Brough and Boucloault for
six weeks’ salary. Lester was given the part of
Squire Western on “approval,” but the manage-
ment didn’t approve, and Boucicault had to take
it over himself. It seems that the actor “on ap-
proval” couldn't talk “shire dialect,” whereas
Mr. Dion B. is very strong in that, and, as Squire
Western, he talks about three dialects in each
sentence. The latest swindle is to take a phono-
graph to the performance of a new opera, and
pirate the entire score, music and all.
Dear Bulletin, —Judge Williams, of Vic-
toria, has passed sentence on George Gossip, John
Reardon, John Holmes and John Murray, con-
victed on several charges c£ assault and robbery,
and who, after assaulting and robbing Mr. Irvine,
manager of the Bank of Australasia, St. Hilda,
got him arrested under a loathsome charge.
Reardon was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment
and three floggings of 13 lashes each, Gossip, to
18 years’ imprisonment and two floggings of 10
lashes each ; and Holmes and Murray to 10 years’
imprisonment and three floggings of 15 lashes
each. Various periods of solitary confinement
were also ordered. No one will deny that the
prisoners' crime was inexpressibly vile—no one
will contend that they, as individuals, deserve pity.
But then the community and the reputation
of the country deserve pity the tendency
of the law should ever be in the direction
of humanising, net brutalising, the popular
sentiment. Where is the logic of flogging a man
and thereafter keeping him in gaol for 20 years
torturing him, and then screwing him down in a
living tomb until he is greyheaded ? Society has
caught Its tigers and has put them in the cage.
Why should it seek to further ensavage
them by subjecting them to torture? Philo-
sophically, Anglo-Australdom is not yet
very much above the level of Dahomey.
Judge Williams ought to be ashamed of himself
thus to degrade his native country in the presence
of the civilised peoples of the earth. If Anthony
Reardon and Co. did to me what they did to bank-
manager Irvine, I would at the moment probably
like to feed fat my vengeance after the manner of
the Red Indian who has caught his enemy. This
would be good retaliation, but, after all, very
poor logic, and a savage and unreasoning act does
not become sacred if coldly and deliberately per-
formed by the State instead of suddenly and
passionately by the Individual—on the other hand,
it becomes more revolting and more absurd. Keep
Anthony Reardon and Co. in gaol until their
bodies rot. That would be logical. Flog Anthony
Reardon and Co. until they die. That possibly
would be logical. But bury them and flog them,
too !~why, thecave-menwouldhave known better.
The history of all civilised countries tends to show
that the critr e of any particular place is great in
proportion to the brutality of its penal code. In
other words, punishment dees not deter ; punish-
ment does not reform. Yet, a man is caught red-
handed'in some crime, he is locked up, flogged,
treated as a wild, dangerous brute beast, every-
thing 1s put in operation calculated to beget hate
and breed revenge, and then—he is let loose on
society, to reap, in some way or other, the whirl,
wind of the vengeance sown within prison-walls in
hideous bodily torture. And he reaps it! Society
gets the full benefit of a reckless man’s cultured
savagery. He has been educated into an enemy.
He went in a man, and he comes out a fiend.
“ You have plucked out my heart, and given me
instead the heart of a wild beast," said the Nor-
folk Island convict who had committed a murder
—who had killed a man for no other retson than
that he, the convict, might be taken to Sjdney and
hanged. The whole business is absurd and
childish; worthy rather the legislation of the
brainless Laputans than of a people boasting a
civilisation founded on reason. -No advanced
scientific thinker of the present day entertains the
doctrine of the complete freedom of the human
will, and all laws formed for the protection of
society must recognise this, or eke prove imbecile
and ineffective. There is only one basis to be re-
cognised. The notion of individual responsibility
is too ethereal a theory for a moment’s serious
consideration. * ‘ The greatest good of the greatest
number” is the one ground upon which
we can deal logically with crime. Hither,
then, imprison for life the man unfitted
by a harmful combination of characteristics
which mark him out as an enemy to society, or
kill him. Put him in an hospital, it needful, or
a prison workshop, where his labour shall benefit
the entire community. This Is a mere matter of
detail. Or, on the other hand, kill him. Recog-
nise that he is not fit to live in society without en-
dangering its existence, therefore eliminate him—
gently, neatly, quietly, with no villainous gallows,
or brutally hideous hangman, or any of the grue-
some and community-degrading pomp and cir-
cumstance of bestial punishment. Do everything
dispassionately, with, in the words of the late Sir
James Martin, “an infinitude of pity" for the
victim; with no revenge, no hysteria; simply
with a recognition of the stern necessity for
logical action. But In the name of the unknown
power we worship as the Deity, let us not fl"g
men whom we are going to keep in prison for life
or for 10 or 20 years.— An Axtstralian.

There were three big able-bodied beaks
on the Bench tin other day at Gore (N.Z ) and
they were trying one miserable, doubled-up
prisoner who had left suddenly with 2s. The
odds were against him,, and he was borne down
by numbers and found goilty. Then the chair-
man straightened himself up to squash the victim
with the knob kerrie of the law, but before he
could begin, the beak on his left said curtly that
it would be srven days. Then the chairman
glared at him and told him to “dry up," as it would
be 30 days, and the left replied that it wouldn’t
be anything of the kind, and reached for the
court log-book to enter the sentence. The chair-
man algo reached for it, and the pair hung on to
opposite ends of the book and howled at each
other. The prisoner rose to state that he would
abide by the decision of the beak who spoke first; but
he restrained himself by the aid of several police-
men. Next, the chairman lost his hold owing to
perspiration, and his rival got the book and
entered the seven days, while the head of the
firm bellowed that it would be a month, if not
more, and he had a good mind to make it six.
The other beak joined in the confusion, and
among the three the prisoner was sentenced to
upwards of 100 years’ confinement of the most
aggravated description. He was then taken away,
and locked up, and the police are endeavouring to
sort out the sentence. The chances are that he
will get out before the winter is over.
The religious editor of the Sidney D.T.
devoted a column lately to Presbyterian missions
to the heathen. Judging from the following ex-
tract we Imagine that the T).T. will have to keep
a Chinese interpreter If it is going to go on wlih
this lino of business :
Bsv. J. M. Boas and Mr. John Kirkland had paid a visit
to the Mission House on a Sabbath evening in January,
when about 40 Chinamen assembled, almost all of a superior
class The service was conducted in Presbyttrian fashion,
Sankay's hymns being used. Mrs. Wai presided at the har-
monium, and the sermon appeared from the delivery to be a
combination cf earnest reasoning and fervent appeal. A
deep impression was made on thur minds of the good thus
wrought among their fellow Chinese colonials. They con-
sidered Mr. Wai eminently qualified fur bis work, and re-
commended that a suitab'e piece of land be leased and a
proper building erected.
The two reverends obviously didn’t understand a
word of th. 9 apostle Wal’s ducourse, but when
that Hallelujah Asiatic pounded his chest, and
screamed, “Hl-kum mukee Mo hoo yo, hi jah
hoo-ki-aah .1 jsa ah-cat hi-bnng hell-ee,” they were
deeply impressed, and moved that he should gat a
church and a piece of land on the ground that he
was “ eminently qualified for his woik,” As it
happened, however, The Bulletin s sub-ediio",
who understands Chinese a good dea’, was present
on one of these occasions when a yellow afloat'e
named Ah Sow was expounding, and this was a
iittle of what he he»id: "Biethlen, Joss not

Sir Henry Parkea created a painful im-
pression in the N S. W. Assembly the other night.
Bibbs’ want of confidence motion was under dis-
cussion, and the old man took to roaming about
in a circus-horse fashion and snorting derisively
at the Opposition speakers, and performing other
antics expressive of lefty acorn. When a Prctec-
tioniet rose to speak, the Premier would gaze at
him as it Ie were a dynamiter or a kanaka, or an
Insolvent who had thrice gone In' o bankruptcy,
and would then tramp heavily out and remain
outside till ho had finished. Just as he was
uttering his last words Pat kes would return and
sit down, but when another orator succeeded him
the aged borrower would stand h’s hair up on
end, give a shiver cf horror, and flee once
more. This was very good while lb lasted,
but once the father of Billingsgate missed
his mark, and came in at the wrong moment.
Dibhs was ergaged In reviewing a famous
outpouring of larrikin abuse, in the course
of which Parkes described the Assembly
as a gathering of blackguards, liars, and
idiots. ‘ ‘ Where are the blackguards ? ’ demanded
the Protectionist leader. - “Will th« blackguards
plea e stand up?” Nobody rose. “Where are
the liara?” The House absolutely howled for the
liar?,, but not cne of them appeared. “ Let’s see
theldlols, then!” thundered Diblr. “Produce
the idiots. Bring them in! Their country cilia
for the Idiots 1” Then he made a pause to see it
the idiots would roll up, and at that unhappy
moment the door opened and Parkes came in.
Apparently he ktew that some one had been In-
quiring for him.

An affirmative person named Askwith

bloodshed as a matter of pr'nciple, but we men-
tion this newinvention inorder to point outhow ex-
tensively it may be utilised as a means of drop-
ping Bibles and tracts on the head of the heathen
who in his blindness bows down to wood and
stone, and if a line and hook were added so that
the flying missionary in the air could flsh for Joss

Something has got to be done to the men
who taka advantage of woman's weakness and
impose upon her. The world la full of girls with
soft innocent faces and tender beseeching eyes
and little delicate white hands, who are taken in
by drapery hounds, defrauded by millinery
hjseuas abused by grocery pirates, and swindled
by animals in the fancy goods trade, and made to
work 18 hours a day, to be defrauded otit of their
wages at the last. Then as they grow a little
older they are taken in by book-fiends Who per-
suade them to expend 307. in a hunk of drivel
which can be bought in a shop for half-a-orown,
and they are had by sewinr-machine agen’s,
and done brown over the Huckleberry piano
and the F/ying Dutchman washing machine
and other swindles, and fer oil these
troubles they have no redress, and can
only take refuge in tear?. Woman is a soft, ten-
der, clinging creature, and requires to be let
down gently. The other day-, at Wellington
(N, Z ), Constable Cole called on ore cf the gentle
sex on some business or other, and she smashed
his head with a fire shovel, and bib a piece out of
him, and set four dogs on to him, and when he got
her into a cab she broke the window and stamped
tt e bottom out of the vehicle so that her head
was inside and her feet trailing on the ground.
Woman is man’s best blessing oa earth, and it is
nee’ssary that something should be done to save
her loving, delicate nature from rough concussion
against the asperities of the outer world.
One hundred men on the Mnrrumbarrah-

This is a sad, distressing job
About the guns at Sydney fired
When Emperor Bill at last expired.
You, Robert, moved by loyal zeal
To show the grief we ought to feel,
From Melbourne in a hurry wired—
“ Load 90 guns and see they're fired."
Then wiped away the tear of sorrow,
And thought—'* What shall I back to morrow ? ”
0 ! Baron Bob, O 1 Baron Bob,
Though you had no desire to rob
Poor Wiliam of a single gun,
They should have fir ed nintty-one.
The story of that lost report
Is bound to reach the Queen, at Court;
Her poor old mother’s heart will ache
For cousin Bill’s post-mortem sake.
You must repair the ill you've done,
By letting off that extra gun.

propitiate the risen. One day, in a crowded room,
he saw old Rogers hovering here and there among

suburbs of Liverpoo l , is a pronounced klepto-

when kneeling at the communion-table only the
ready hand of the rector saved the quaint old
wine-oup from sliding up the earl’s sleeve. It is
the duty of his valet to examine his master’s
clothes every morning, when he has dined out the
night before. Whatever 1s found ia taken to the
countess, who returns It to the owner, with a
pretty note of apology. The Earl la quite aware
of his unfortunate weakness, and has struggled
against it in vain. No fear of detectives or ex-
posure makes heavy his light fingers, and it ia

Barnsley, which runs through the very centre of
the British iron districts, is laid with German

“ I can imagine,” writes William Morris,
in the Commonweal, “ soma of our friends grin-
ning rather bitterly at the title of an article in
the current number of the Nineteenth Century,
‘ How to live on £7OO a-year,' and thinking that
they would like to try the experiment. It should
be explained that the title ought to run, * How to
live in the upper ranks of »he shabby-genteel on
£7OO a-ye»r.’ This is a different problem, and a
sufficiently tough one to those who are compelled
to live In this group of ours. The recipe for it is
much as follows: give away nothing ; let your
hospitality be merely conventional; take no
pleasure except for the sake of gentility ; never
buy a book ; look very sharp after your servant;
in short, repress every Instinct towards kindliness
and generosity, and you may cut quite a good
figure in the ranks of gentility, and be in fact a
fine specimen of the genus ‘ snob.’"
People very often imagine that the dis-
covery of a flaw in the working of a new move-
ment Is an indictment past appeal against the
movement. Thus we are always having pointed
out in the columns of the Australian capitalistic
Press the fact that many workmen when they
become rich are fiercer Tories than those born to
the purple. This is perfectly true, but It ia a
charge against human nature, not against Demo-
cracy. Then we have leaders upon the “Weak
Point of Democracy ” even in alleged democratic
papers. Has autocracy not its weak point ? Are
aristocracies invulnerable or oligarchies armour-
plated? The capitalistic Press Is now chuckling
because George and M’Glynn have managed to
erect a misunderstanding between them on the
tariff question. But they need not chuckle so
loudly. The cause of Progress will go on. It
does not depend on George or M‘Glynn, or their
friendship, or the friendship of a thousand
Georges and M‘Glynns.

One of the most attractive characters in

grim humour We forgive him his crimes for the
sake of his wit Such a character was the man
who, with an accomplice, was sentenced to two
years’ imprisonment in Melbourne lately, and re-
leased on appeal after depositing £2O. Tee first
use he made of his liberty was to call on a justice
of the peace and induce him to go to the gaol and
admit the other burglar to bail until an appeal
was also heard In his case. So chat one criminal
under sentence was allowed to become bail for
another, who was thereby set free. This would
have satisfied the satirical tendencies of most
men. Bub it was not enough for this one. In
order to rub the satire in as much as possible he
gave his name as Loch—nos Smith, Brown or
Jones, bub Loch. Tnat’s where the grim humour
oomea in. It is cafe to suppose that after this
gentleman has dene his “ two years’ stretch” he
will not be among the distinguished visitors at

“ The audience imagines," said a young

even though it may not be given with genuine
feeling, must, nevertheless, be agreeable. Never
was there so fatal an error, or a supposition so
stupidly unwarranted by the real facts of the case
The first time I knew I had to be kissed on the
stage by the good-looking leading man, I was by
no means averse to it. I knew that the role
called for the hiss, and I was satisfied. Shall I
ever forget tnat kiss ! I think not; I found a face
beside my own, so besmeared with rouge, so In-
ertia ced with powder, so moi-C with cosmetic; that
I assure you it didn’t look like a face. As I said,
this was ready my first stage-kiss The leaning

on food exceedingly flavoured with garlic. I
remember I had to spring back after the embrace
and exclaim, ‘ How dare you insult me with your
kitses! Give them to her who will appreciate
them.’ I made that speech from my heart. I
thoroughly meant what I said, and the effect
upon the audience wai excellent. Satge kisses
are generally disgusting. Of course, sometimes
there are merely make•believe kisses, but when
you are right in front of the audience that la im-
possible. The audience may sometimes be shocked
at the apparent warmth of a stags kiss, but they
would be more shocked it it were not given. A

received a card of invitation to “the Yorlck Club, ’

their tales and shy the accursed sheet to the

paper should henceforth be officially denounced as
only fit to be stamped on by hogs, that the office
should be sown with salt, and that jackasses
should tread the editor’s table underfoot. The
cause of this excitement lies in the fact that ihe
Pall Mall recently described Wales as being
“fat.” Wales is fat—for years he has been taking
things to make him thin, and they have all missed
fire, or else they have rushed to his head and
made his hair come out, but loyal subjects are not
expected to recognise the circumstance that
Tummy’s clothes are strained to bursting point.
No man who regards Wales as fat shall enter the

A. very psirfal circomstaacs happen d to
a Sydney citizen the other 1 day, and if sny oasu •
Pass-*r-by coancea t.> sea a man witn carnage n
his eye and a club In his right hand standing on
wharv s and railway platforms; and huogril;
waiting for bis enemy to fail into his hands am
have hia eye swallowed, the signs are that it is
he. A few weeks ago he had a wife and a bosom
friend and a happy home, but now he is a mora
wreck, with dander in hia soul and sorrow prey
i‘>g upon his vitals. It is all owing to the bosun
friend. A few weeks ago that gentleman took
him mysteriously aside, and told him that he hac
entered into a Ja ge coal spec, at Newcastle, and
that he wished him to go do vn there and descend
into the bowels of the darksome earth and report
upon it. He winked as he said this, but his vic-
tim imagined this evidence of guile to be merely a
contraction of the muscular system or a spasm of
the brck of the h ad. or something, and he went
*ik« a lamb to the slaughter ana was betrayed.
There v as no coal spec, at Newcastle, but wh«-n he
landed at that coaly city a detective sidied up to him
and told him >hat he was a fl f old bird, a d a sly
dawg, and saveral oiher animats, but it wouldn t
do really now. A this time of life he ought to
be ashamed of hlmse f to be going on like that,
a-de-sercin’ of hia innercent, trusting wife —he
ought, indeed. Now, was he going to come along
quietly, or was he going to m«ke a scene ? While
he spoke he was gamly shoving bis prisoner
towards the lock-up, and he continued to address
plaintive remonstrances to him as he backed him
into a celt and turned the key on him. Various
other indignities were heaped upon him later on.
His wife sent down an affidavit that he was
making a brutal attempt to skip the colony and
had left her nothing but an umbrella to live upon,
and his bo om friend hired a lawyer to prosecute.
It was nearly a week before he got out, and then
he found that his friend and his wife, after selling
all the furniture, had eloped together. Naturally
enough he has lost a good deal of his former con-
fldance in both of them and when he meets th
pair he contemplates demanding an apology.
He also regards it as unjustifiable in his friend to
borrow his shirts to elope in, and unkind on the
part ol his wife to chalk-up £lOO worth of mil-
linery to hia account so that she m*ght fl? in a
duck of a bonnet. He wants to know wr.y they
took his cigars and sold his dog and carried away
his allpi ers and dressing-gown, and he poln-s out
that they left the gas alight all over the house for
a week and nave made the fortune of the gas-
company at his expanse. Also what dooce
became of the money he left behind for the rent
he can't make out, and his dress-suit is gone, and
all the wine has been drunk, He objects to these
things.

Money.
Dear Bulletin,-— Reckoning money as a tally
of exchange, as it is supposed to he, some
very curious incongruities come to light. If
a man gives a bill; neglecting for the time Its
convertibility into State money, and negoti-
ating it simply as negotiable in account, it is,
on the face of it, his own acknowledgment, and
all he has to do is to render an equivalent. But
in order to give an acknowledgment in State
mohey, he must first render a similar equivalent
to the State, or to someone who has found a
quantity of gold or silver, and got the State to
mint it for him. And now reverting to the fact
that almost every acknowledgment is for State
money, and not substance—in a word is a tally
for a tally— it follows that the great majority are
compelled to expend some service upon those
possessed of the tallies, in order to acquire the
mere record or tally of their services with one
another. In other word?, their energies are im-
pounded for the benefit of talij-holders before
they are allowed to devote any energy at all to
the purposes for which the tallies are required.
Again, in the case of indebtedness, the obligation
incurred is not to those who render the service,
but to those who lend the tallies to acknowledge
it, and a certain additional number of tallies must
be given back. Hence the bfiance is adjusted,
not by equivalent services, but by the number of
tallies ; and out of this arises the temptation, the
necessity, in fact, for depriving other persons of a
portion of their services without acknowledg-
ment in order to have the requisite number of
tallies to give back Tne obliges gives some of
his obligors as many acknowledgments, only as
will enable them to tally off the mere necessaries
cf life, in order to pay others of them for the hire

TICKET’ YET?”
of the tallies. Or he does so in order to reta f n
some of the tallies for-hlmself, and thus command
further services, as an obligor, instead of owing
them as what he really is—an obligee. And this
chaos of folly and fraud is what we call a civilised
social system!
The people of Great Britain are getting a thorough
hold of the big end of the stick. They are begin-
ning to discover that the land question lies at tbe
root of all class-government, and they are profit-
ing by their discovery. Too long have they been
hoodwinked by the manceuvres of party politi-
cians who raise questions to occupy the time of
the Legislature which can have no possible re-
ference to practical politics, and thereby manage
to throw dust in the eyes of the people’s represen-
tatives. Very slowly has it dawned on the masses
of England, Scotland, and $ ales that the struggle
for Home Rule in Ireland is not a racial but an
agrarian struggle. Amongst the Irish this is as
yet an undiscovered truth. Only the leaders of
the movement know that it would matter nothing
if the landlords were of the same stock as their
labour-sweated tenants instead of being aliens. The
rank-and-file of the Irish movement deify Arch-
bishop Crokb and Michael Davitt in ths same
breath that they curse Henry George and
Father M‘Glynn, without perceiving that their
cases are identical. With the rest of the United
Kingdom this is not so, They everywhere
“drop” to the position and show themselves
eager to follow Ireland’s example. The
Crofters of Skye, Lewis, and Farris Islands
have recently been imitated by the ratepayers of
?
London itself, and the Welsh have shown frequent
dlspositioa to take up the cudgels of revolt. In
Wales, the struggle, if it ever developed into an
agrarian campaign like that of Ireland, would be
embittered by a religious grievance. Nearly all
the Welsh are Methodists. To enter an Episco-
palian Church is to them the hall-mark of eternal
damnation. Yet are they compelled to pay away
a tenth part of their substance to support what
they regard as devil-worship. When the reverend
land-shark cannot collect his sacerdotal black-
mail he puts his case in the hands of the police;
and the gentlemen in blue prance round with
their batons to gather in the tithes for the gentle-
men in black. In Anglesey, lately, great rioting
and fighting hag occurred in consequence. It
would be much be.ter if peasant and police com-
bined to troucce the parson, instead of the peasant
and police trouncing one another for this ecclesi-
astical individual’s peculiar benefit. But, proh
ably, they have not yet risen to this stage of social
development, and when they do rise to it the well-
paid, lazy parsons may be about as extinct as the
moa or the megatherium If people icflected at all,
what a farce the whole thing would seem, and what
a reduclio ad absurdum of all the main principles
of Christianity ! The followers of the meek and
lowly Nazarene, who were told to take no scrip
and no thought for to-morrow, hesitate not in
this Nineteenth Century to call to their aid
Die tranche sn of authority, and trail in the dust
of ridicule the principles they pretend to follow.
They are continually paraphrasing the words of
their Master, though they imitate not His life:
“I come to bring not peace on earth, but a police-
man’s waddy.”

“It will, doubtless, ever be true that poverty
walks in our midst,” says the smug Melbourne
Daily Telegraph, the organ of the parsons.
“ It is a law from which there is no escape ; and
looked into with keener vision, it may be dimly
perceived that that law is not without its benefi-
cent meaning,” We can fancy the reverend party
who wrote the article from which this slab of
cheerful wisdom is taken, gently stroking his
rotund stomach with the palm of his podgy hand
and smiling affably to himself as he rounded off the
sentence. What we would like to see just now
would be a parson with a vision keen enough to
see the beneficent meaning of poverty when
applied to himself. Wo have met with one
or two, but that is all. Poverty is good
for the poor—that is the good old maxim
of the parsons and the priests whose
mission on earth has always been to make the
poor think they will be able to go into Heaven on
a free pass while the rich howl in vain outside.
In the meantime the rich keep possession of the
earth which is a sure thing, anyhow. Are the
priests and the rich not nefariously connected
We would smilb enigmatically. But, thank the
Law of Change, nothing lasts forever.

The Sydney D.T. in a leading article on the
Trades Council which lately sat in Brisbane rose
in its republican might and administered in the
lollowlng Words a severe rebuke to Queensland
Griffith and the imperialists :
Probably many of the delegates who expressed themselves
a fav ur of separate g from the Empire rather than be
rompelled to receive the Chinese in Australia may know
shat on the pa>t of the Imperialist party, tf which Sir
Samuel Griffith is a member, the offer has been made of
the northern half of Australia to China as the price of alli-
ance with England.
Probably the delegates do know It. It la pro-
bable also that some of the delegates know that
the Sydney D.T. is pledged to support the policy
of Free-trade, which la, in Australia, whether
rightly or wrongly, an anti-Democratic policy and
a leading plank of the Imperialistic platform.
The delegates may likewise recollect that Sir
Henry ParkEs, the white-maned fetich of the
D.T s. adoration, Is an Imperialist, He never
loses an opportunity to drivel over “the loved
mother country.” Recently he engineered
through the N.S.W. Parliament a measure
which Griffith was powerless to engineer
through the Queensland; viz, the Naval
Defence Bill. Almost Immediately after this
Bill had been manipulated into law In New
Sonth Wales, Sir Henry Parkbs received the
price of his treachery to his country- an Imperial
decoration; a G.C.M,G.shipi The D.T. is In a
delightfully funny position to cast a brick at

Dennis Kearney* the*well-known American agi-
tator, recently gave Father M‘Glynn a chunk of
advice which is well worth considering by some
of onr own universal philanthropist?; when he
said —“We can't very well reform all the world
at once. We must take it piece by piece." Not
only Henry George, but many other Land
Nationalists, forget this truth when they clamour
for the throwing open of our markets to the com-
petition of the world. The effect, as Kearney
points out, would be to establish equality among
working men all the world over, and the Austra-
lian doesn’t want equality with the four-shilling*
a w«ek Chinaman at present. Universal Free-
trade means that every man must ultimately
stand on the same wage-level as his neighbours,
and if 3,000,000 Australians can’t hoist 100,000,000
Chows up to the ! r own standard, then they must
go down to the yellow man's level and stay there
till the yellow man rises,

The rights (f public meetings are now a thing of
the past In Sydney, New South Wales, If they
ever existed, they exist no longer. The work of
the ' scamping out ” Tories of Jubilee and JBxhi-
bltion Building notoriety bears fruit, and that in
an unexpected quarter. The other night a public
meeting was convened to c insider the adoption
of a manifesto for the Sydney Lard Nationalisa-
tion Lee gar. The chair was taken by a clergy-
man of alegtd liberal ten den cUs. The value of
his adbeie ce to any cause oan readily bs ganged
by the fact that he publicly announetd that “It
was only after having been assured by Mr.
Fox all that it was not essential that the chair-
man of the meeting should he a thorough believer
in land-natioxallsation, that he consented to pre-
side.'’ In another part of hii address he
admitted that he had “read thtough the
most s and ud works of Henry George, ’ although
“h> was not in favour of land nationalisation

was anxious to c.nvey that he was a trimmer and

the cause of land national! a*ion “ was coming,”
ha would jiln P, mayhap do it the honour of
heading it. He was waiting to see upon which
side the cat jumped. With such a chairman one
is prepa T ed to hear of any kind of unfairness, and
before the meeting ended the Rev. Mr, Jackson
had an opportunity of displaying bis notions of
liberalism. Mr. W. W. Collins decided to move
j»n amendment, but he was greeted with cries of
“ Sio down ; we don’t want to hear you! ’ Mr. Col-
lins made another effort, but “ was immediately
howled down.” Mr. Collins made yet another
effort to be heard, but in the languige of the
paper aforecited, “the audience refund to hear
him, and he gently collapsed." The chairman
made no effort to s;cure fairplay, or to enforce
tte right of any person desiring to make himself
heard in a place of public meeting , which it was
his manifest duty to do. But the most disgusting
cuing about it ia the approval with which an
alleged enlightened paper quetea the brutality
and noisy behaviour of the people to whom it re-
commends us to look for the accomplishment of a
great reform.


THE WALLED-IN ROOM.
BEING THE TERRIBLE ADVENTURE OF AN
IRISH NATURALIST.
I opened my eyes and looked around me. A
man was leaning over my bed; near the man
stood a woman with a bonnet with great white
wings on the sides, holding in her hand a moist
compress. The room was plain and neat, with
clean white walls. On a table, covered with a
great napkin of yellow linen, I noted a number of
strange objects—rows ot little vials, and a brown
earthen jar filled with bits of ice. Through the
muslin curtains, which bellied out from the win-
dow in the balmy air, I could see a patch ol blue
sky and the tops of green trees bending lightly in
the breeze. Where was I ? I; seemed like a long
dtaam that I had had ; my head felt empty, my
limbs ached, and I could not think.
The man gently lifted my head and gave me a
few drops of some liquid, which I swallowed with
avidity.
“Well, Mr, Furnis s ,” he said, “how do yon
feel? ’
“ Eb, what?’’ I cried. “ Where am I?”
“ You a-e in my house, my dear sir, and we
shall take good care of you. Now,” ho added,
replacing my head on the pillow, “ oa quiet and
go to sleap;”
I gazed at him for a long time, and all at once I
recognised Doctor Bertram, the celebrated special-
ist in insanity. A shudder pissed through my
frame. Why was lin Doctor Bartram’s hospital,
instead of in my home, near Pnoenls Park, with
my books, my herbs, and my microscopes around
me? His hospital was far midpeopls I —and thit
Sister of Charity, those vials, that bowl ot ice—
my God, I mus!) he mad I But why?—how?
“How long have I been hers?” I asked, after
a time.
“ For four weeks, Mr. Furniss But you must
be quiet and sleep. Now do nob try to talk.”
For a month! Was it possible ? What had
happened? But even as I asked myself these
questions, little by little I went off to sleep, and I
saw, in a billowy msadow, a roid covered with
blood and bordered on either side with monstrous
microscopes shaped like trees, a road on which
two llccle girls played at pitch and catch with a
severed head, while Djc:or Bertram, comically
bonneted with a religious cap, rode astride of a
dead body, which reared, and pranced, and kicked
till he ooaid scarce keep his seat.
The next morning I
was better : and day by
day I improved, though
that horrible nightmare
came to me each night.
Bub It grew less and less
distinct, and in a few
weeks it almost csated to
trouble me.
One evening the doc-
tor, whom I had not
eeen during the day
seated himself near my
bed,
“ Well," said he, feel-
ing my pulse, ‘ ! you are
doing famously. I'll have
you out as good as new,
In a few days. But
you’ve had a close (have.
It has been one of the
prettiest cates of cerebral
con gestlon I ever handle d
—a beautiful case. Why,
it’s a wonder you are
alive now. Tell me, how
is your memory; can
you remember what hap-
pened before you were
brought here ? ’
“ I—l don’t know, I
cannot think. I have
passed through some-
thing fearful. What it is
1 cannot say. From the
faint glimmercf recollec-
tion that comes to me,
I have the sensation of
having been dead —mur-
dered ! Ob, it is fright-
ful. My brain Is weak
yet. Tnen, the child a
pretty golden - hair ed
child rolling on the
floor."
“Come, come, this will never do, said th
doctor. “You can tell me all about it in ths
mcrn ”
“No, now, doctor,” I cried. “It is coming
back to me. Yes, I have it now.”
Here is an exact transcript ot my recital as I
told it to Dr. Bertram and, later, to the magis-
trate.
You know my passion for natural history. Well,
scarcely a week passes that I do not go into the
country botanizing That day I went to Glasnevio,
where, as you know, the marshy meadows are
rich in curious plants, infusoria, and diatoms,
I was returning, and was almost in Dublin with
my box full of rare specimens, on which I ex-
pected to make a report that would astonish the
Botanical Society, when I saw a little girl, cer-
tainly not more than five or six years old, who
was all alone, crj iag t s it her little heart would
break. I approach d her, hue at sight of me she
redoubled her cries, I could see that the Iktle
one was los h , and that she did not know where t)
go, so I spoke to her kindly, and, by dint of pro-
mising her unlimited bonbons, g )t her to t?ll me
that her name was Lizsle, and that she lired near
Beresford-plaoe in Lo wer abbey street. I took
her hand, and we soon st arted off, talking together
like old friends, she was a .beautiful,child, fresh
and rosy, with great, candid eyas and fair hair,
which was cut short over her ejes and fell In
golden ringlets about her shoulders. She trotted
bravely along, her soft, little hand holding my
great, ruddy paw confliingly. As we walked she
told me remarkable tales, in which figured a big,
black horse, a little knife, a doll, and a number o!
people I did nob knew.
I Lizzie was afraid she would be scolded when
she arrived home, but she was not, and I —l was
received with transports by her mother, who was
half distracted. Never was gratitude expressed
so heartily and pleasantly. Who was I, where
did I live, how did I happen to find her, and a
thousand like questions were showered upon me.
‘ Ob, Mr. Furnias,” said the mother, “you are
the saviour of my child. How can we express
our gratitude 1 We a e not rich, but such a debt
cannot ba paid in gold. How happy my husband
will be to repeat my thanks to you. He Is still at
his office, but—will you do us a great kindness,
will you honour our humble board ta-morrow ? I
shall have a savant here like yourself, and you
two will enjoy each other’s company, I am sure.
And my husband will be so happy to have you.”
I thanked her for the invitation, and promised
to be on hand.
At the appointed hour I was shown into their
modest parlour, and you may be sure the hus-
band’s gratitude was no less warmly expressed
than the wife’s. And little Lizzie threw her arms
around my neck, and showered on me the inno-
cent caresses of a happy child. I seemed, Indeed,
to be ore of the family.
The dinner was a merry one, the savant seemed
to be an interesting man —in brief, I passed an
excellent evening.
The air had been heavy the whole day, and In
the evening a storm came on. Thunder-claps
succeeded one another without interruption, the
rain fell in torrents. Whether it was the effect of
the storm, of the suffocating heat, or of the wine
I had drunk, I felt a strange melancholy, I could
not breathe comfortably. I was about to set out
for home; however, for it was late and my house
was at soma distance; but they insisted that I
should stay. It would be foolish to expose myself
to such a tempest, when I was not feeling well;
the mother begged me with such a good grace that
I felt forced to remain and pass the night in that
hospitable house. The/ ceremoniously conducted
me to my room, and there wished me good night.
I remember, even, that Lizzie having fallen asleep
ia her father's arms, I kissed her little cheek,
paled by sleep, and her dimpled little arms.
Left alone, I to undress slowly; and
wandered about the room, as one always does
when one sleeps In a strange place, I felt as if I
should smother in the close atmosphere of the
room. Before getting in bed; I - wanted to inhale
a little of the outside air, and In spite of the roar-
ing storm, I tried to open the window. It was a
false window.
“ Well, well! ’’ I exclaimed, a little surprised.
I thought I would remove the ohlmney-soraen ;
It was a false chimney. I rushed to the door—
ft was looked! Fear seized me, and, holding my
breath, I listened, The house was quiet, all
seemed to be asleep. Then I inspected the room
carefully, straining my ears for the least sound.
On the floor, near the bed, I noticed spots ; it was
blood —dried and blackened blood ! I shuddered,
and a cold sweat stood out on my forehead.
Blood! Why should there be blood there? And
I saw that a whole sea of blood must have been
spllo there for a great space around, the hard
wooden floor had been freshly scrubbed and
scraped. All at ones I cried out. Under the bed
I had seen a man, stretched out, motion-
less as an overturned statue. With trem-
bling hands I touched the man. He did
nob move. With trembling hands I pushed

S/x Months. 1
YOU’RE ANOTHER !
the man; he did not move. With trembling
hands I seized the man by the feet and drew him
forth —he was dead 1 His neck had been cleanly
out, as with one stroke of a razor, and the head
held to the trunk only by a slender ligament.
I thought I should go mad. But something must
be done —the assassin might coma at any moment.
I raised the body to place it on the bed. I made a
false step, and the livid head turned over, swung
to and fro for a moment like a hideous pendu-
lum, and then, detached from the trunk, fell
on the floor with a dull sound. With great diffi-
culty I introduced the decapitated trunk between
the sheets, I picked up the head and placed it on
the pillow like that of a sleeping man, and, having
blown out the candle, I slipped under the bed. I
did all this mechanically, without thought of
defence or safety ; io was instinct that prompted
me, not intelligence or reflection,
My teeth chattered. My hands were web with
a thick moisture. I felt as it I had gone to bed in
a charnel-house.
I remained there, in that awful fear, minutes,
hours, months, years, csnburies—l do not know
ho v long, I lost all idea of tine and place. All
was silent. From without the noise ot the storm
and the whistling of the wiad came to me softened
and sad, like moan*. I could not picture to my-
self the assassin who was coming—who was there,
perhaps In that state of horror I could see only
little Lizzie fair, rosy, and frank, with her doll
and her great hab; I could see her sleeping in
her father's arms; now and than she lightly
raised her eyelids and disclosed her eyes, which
seemed to me to be bold, implacable, cruel, mur-
derous.
The door opened, but as softly as the scratching
of a mouse. I bit my Ups till the blood came, to
keep from crying out. Now a man stepped in
with gliding tread, with infinite precautions to
avoid touching the furniture. It seemed to me
as if I could sea the cruel, clutching fingers gliding
over my clothes, saarchiog my pockets. Then the
steps came nearer, seemed to graze me. I felt
that the man was bending over the bad, that he
struck one fierce blow. Then 1 knew nothing
more.
When I recovered consciousness, the room had
become silent again. But fright held me nailed
to the spot. At length I decided to escape, with
what caution you may imagine. On tiptoe I
gained the door, which had not been closed. Not
a sound, not a breath, Feeling my way, I passed
into the hall. I waited to see a head thrust sud-
denly from out the shadows, a knife gleam in the
dark. But no—the brute, glutted with crime,
slept without remorse. I descended the stairs,
drew the bolt of the door, and, half fainting with
the blood frozen in my veins, I fell into the gutter
of the deserted street.
Doctor Bertram had listened to my recital with
the deepest interest.
* ‘ And there I found yon, Mr, Furnlss, and in
what a state I Could you recognise the house ?"
“ Yes,” I replied ; “ but to what end ?”
“ Well, let me cure you; and then we shall go
together to the house of these assassins.”
Eight days later, the doctor and I stood in
Lower Abbey-street I recognised the terrible
house. All the blinds were drawn ; in front of
the door a placard was placed, bearing the legend i
“ To Let,”
I inqillred of the former residents from a neigh-
bour.
“Iheyhave been gone a month or more,” she
replied. “It’s a great pity, for they were very
nice people.’’— Translated from the French of
Octave Mirbeau,
The “ Vagabond ” alludes to Bill Hollo-
way’s stop-daughter as “ Sweet Miss Essie
Jenyns." We were pretty far gone ourselves, but
we never got quite so far as that.
There was a little adverse criticism of his
Liverpool speech, and Sir Henry announced that
he was very unwell. The storm has blown over
and the Freetrade press discovers that “ bis indis-
position ” was not “ so serious as was at first sup-
posed.” Bismarck had no desire to put in an ap-
pearance during the coronation festivities of the
Emperor Frederick of Germany. He announced
that ha was ill. He always adopts this course if
there is a fuss on the carpet. Some people call
Parke 3 the hairy Bismarck. This Is probably the
point of resemblance alluded to in the sobriquet.
“ Breechloader,” in a letter of sirgularly
unique idiotor, evidently written in all serious-
ness, to the S. M. Herald, advises the N. S, W.
Government as soon as war is declared between
Great Britain and some foreign power, to “ pur-
chase a dozen fast steamers of 300 tons, convert
them into gigantic torpedoes by placing 100 tons
of gunpowder in their bows (the steamers to be
dividid into many water-tight c jmpartments), the
vessel to be steered and the gunpowder exploded
by one man in a bullet-proof tower at the very
stern, mock man being stationed about the ship to
draw the enemy’s fire from this particular turret."
“ Breechloader" is “convinced that this plan
could be cheaply carried into effect, and that there
would be hundreds of applicants for the honour of
steering these vessels against an invading fleet.”
In the case of an attack by land, he tells the
people of Sydney that they may “safely ” place
their destinies In the hands of Majtr-Oeneral
Richardson, especially if his actions are not ham-
pered by excessive political interference.
Sydney D.T. saya that “the promotion
of Dr. Ruble, a native of Sydney, to the editorial
chair of the London Evening News is a flattering
instance of the success of young Australians in
England.” This is another aspect of the beauty
and holiness of drawing closer the bonds that
connect us with the “ dear old mother country,”
&c. Australia is sunk low, indeed. If some
seedy, needy politician, with the social prestige of
an ex-shanty-keeper and the moral reputation of
a oattle-dnffer, goes to England to learn the
market quotali n for treachery and receives as the
price of his corrupt vote a paltry K C. M G. -ship,
we smile over the “honour” done to Australia,
The appointment of Cardinal Moran to the see of
Sydney was quoted as an honour done to Aus-
tralia by the Pope. Bah! It was only
his Holiness’s official recognition of the fact
that Australia was worth looting in the
name of the Church. Dr. Ruble succeeds
Frank Harris as the editor of a wretchedly
Intolerant and blatant Tory print. And this
is called Australian success ! Grovel now
takes the place of patriotism, and the syco-
phant is elevated into a hero. People that babble
in this way ought to recollect that nowadays
anybody can “ succeed” who is sufficiently sub-
servient, The motto of the present day should be
“Nothing succeeds like subserviency." Frank
Harris, the man whom Dr. Ruble succeeds as
editor of the London Evening News, is an Irish-
American, who was associated with Chamberlain
and Dilke in the production of the “ Radical Pro-
gramme” during Joe’s celebrated “ three-acres-
and-a-cow" crusade. Ha deserted his party and
joined the Tories for “social” bribes. The
Evening News (a halfpenny paper) has been a
dull and dismal failure since its birth, and has
only been kept allva by means of the Tory feeding-
bottle.
THE BULLETIN (Published at Sydney, N.S.W)
The Unique Weekly, Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
The Bulletin, the Premier Australian Literary
Journal, is the only paper which has a con-
sistent and distinctive Australian National
Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
Democracy as the Australian National Creed,
Payment of Members.
One Man, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land,
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A united Australia and Protection against the
World.
The Election by the Australian peoples of the
Governors of the Australian colonies.
The Bulletin denounces —
Religious Interference in Politics.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the other half that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started seven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it p®s-
sessed a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news*
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have, during the
last year, spent some thousands of pounds in
fitting their buildings With the latest appliances
for high-class printing and the production of illus-
trations, and they have now issued The Bulletin
in an entirely new form —printed with new type
of improved legibility on the finest paper, and
adorned with sketches from the hands of the
ablest and best-paid newspaper artists Australia
has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The voice of The Bulletin is the beacon-fire
of national progress : it is the forceful summons to
the crusade against the monopolies in land,
wealth, power, and privilege—the direct cause of
half the misery which now afflicts British
humanity. Against the claims of avaricious
clergy who claim to monopolise salvation, against
the dark despotism of grasping plutocrats, and
against the exercise of any human authority
which has not been granted by the people over
whom it is exercised, The Bulletin will fearlessly
and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals tp the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the hushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the
most popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
The circulation of The Bulletin in Sydney is
unrivalled by that of any other weekly journal,
and more than a hundred copies of it are sold in
Melbourne to one of any other paper printed out-
side that city. Perhaps the strongest proof of The
Bulletin’s popularity is found in the unchallenge-
able fact—easily ascertainable from any postal
official —that, of all journals issued in Australasia,
The Bulletin is the one most frequently re-
mailed from one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most-
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

MAGNIFICENT FREEHOLD ESTATE.
MOUNT GILEAD is distant from Sydney only
two hours by rail and road, being only 30 minutes’

scribe it as one of the most valuable and highly
improved properties ever submitted for sale in the
colonies. About 1600 ACRES have been cleared
of dead wood and unsightly trees, leaving only
valuable living timber, giving the Estate a Park-
like appearance, resembling an English Country

HUMBUGGED AGAIN.
I saw so much said about the merits of D/-. Soule's Ameri-
can Hop Bitters, and my wife —who was always doctoring,
and never well—teased me urgently to get her some. I con-
cluded to be humbugged again ; and I am glad I did, for in
less than two months’ use of Dr, Soule's American Hop
Bitters my wife was cured, and she has remained so for
eighteen months since. 1 like such humbugging. H. T. St.

smoking Is poisonous. We hope so. Most of the

A WORLD OP GOOD.
One of the meat popular medicines now before the Amen
can public is Dr. Soule’s Amei ican Hop Bitters. You see it
everywhere. People take it with good effect. It builds them
up. It is not as pleasant to the taste as some other Bitters,
as it is not a whisky drink. It is more like the o:d-fashiontd
bone set tea that has done a world of good. If you don't
feel just right, try Dr. Soule’s American Hop Bitters

A Boon to Humanity.— ln 1844 a therapeutical inven-
tion vas brought before the world, which surprised everyone,
in that it dispelled, modified or lessened Pain, the charac-
teristic symptom of nearly all diseases. The inventor made
his discovery, although at the time Scepticism
raised her head, and people loudly acclaimed it was im-
possible that a tingle medicine could arrest Pain of every
kind, and cure a v»rieiy of diseases t uch, however, was the
fact when Mr. Richard Freeman placed in the hand of the
public his Genuine Cbkrodyne. Year by year its cosmo-
politan popularity has increased, till it is njw f”und in every
quarter of the globe and thoussnds daily, in New Zealand
and cither lands express their gratitude and sens o of security
from the use of this medicine.—Sold everywhere throughout
the Colonies. Insist upon having “ Freeman's ” only

SYDNEY,
Few people are aware of the alarming prevalence
of Kidney and Liver diseaaea, especially among
those who have arrived at or past middle age. It
is declared on good authority that fully one-half
the deaths in this country are either directly or
indirectly the result of Kidney or Liver disease of
some sort.
A great majority of men above 40 years of ago
are afflicted with some sort of affection of the
Kidneys or Bladder, and these diseases are on the
increase. Persons are often seriously affected
before they know of it themselves, and thus these
insidious disorders get a good foothold before any-
thing is done to dislodge them.
Dropsy, Gravel, Diabetes, Bright’s disease, In-
continence, Debility, Catarrh of the Bladder,
Albumenuria, &c., are among the many forms of
these diseases. Most of these are very difficult to
cure, defying the powers oftentimes of the best
physicians obtainable, and are pronounced by
many to be incurable.
Physicians state that many forms of Kidney and
Liver disease are very difficult to detect, as in
diseases of this form oftentimes there are no
symptoms of a marked nature This is one of the
reasons why they are so difficult to cure.
Dr. Bell’s Kidney and Liver Bitters Is a specific
for Kidney and Liver troubles, Bladder and
Urinary diseases, Dropsy, Gravel, Diabetes, and
all of that class of disorders.
It cures Biliousness, Headaches, Jaundice, Liver aQ d
Stomach troubles, Dispensia, Constipation, and Piles
It cures Intemperance, Nervous diseases, General Debility,
Female Weaknesses and excesses.
It is thoroughly reliable, highly recommended, works
nromptly, relieves at once, and wa» never known to fail.
v v TESTIMONIALS.
Gents. —I have been troubled with Kidney disease; there
was also fluttering of the heart—palpitation, I
and I had to lie v> ry quiet after going to bed At last I
thought I would try a bottle of your bells bitters I
purchased some at Bedford, and took the medicine as
directed, and after using one bottle, I felt no more of the
fluttering heart I got another bottle, and had to take only
oi e-half of it to be cured. My daughter was ilmilarly
troubled; had no appetite ; could not sleep at night. I gave
her my half remaining bottle, and she rests as well as ever.
There* is no trouble with my kidneys now. I shall keep
your medicine «n hand
Oc’ober, 1886. William K
Gentlemen—l have been troubled ever since I was a child
with Headaches of a nervous character, and my mouth was
full of canker s^res—so bad, indeed, that I could not eat;
nor could I est at night. At last I tried your bells
bit EBS, and two bottles have brought me out all right, and
I now feel like a new person.

Emperor Fritz, says a cable, “ although he
arrived durlug a heavy snowstorm, at once pro-
ceeded on a visit to the body of his father.” Why
not? One would think that it wasn’t etiquette to
call upon a dead man in stormy weather. And
that sweet idea of “proceeding on a visit to the
body” somehow reminds us of the undertaker,
who whispered a funeral guest—“ If you please,
sir, the corpse’s brother wants to speak with
you.”
Thomas Fulton, a wood-dealer, was up be-
fore the Fitzroy (Vic.) Court the other day,
charged with threatening to bill, and two or three
doctors deposed that he was mad. Whereupon
Thomas snorted like a war-horse, and observed ;
“ Mad be dashed I I can buy two load!- of wood,
and t-eh them for six that’s not mad, is it ?’ Toe
Bench surmised that it was a mania peculiar to
the trade, and ordered him an unspecified term at
Kew ; and now no wood-dealer in Melbourne feels
safe. But then, any wood-merchant with the
name of Fulton deserves ten years for false pre-
tences.
When Mathew Burnett was on the Durham
Lend (Vie.), about 23 ago, he hung out his
sign and held forth with fine frenzy at the little
chapel on the hill, and everyone within reach
rallied round to hear the great ap »stle of slops
bang the liouor fiend, and watch the Wesleyans
weep when Mat expounded the scriptures In his
old hysterical style. Amongst the mob came one
lady of Amazonian pr -portions, who joined in the
hymns with infinite gusto, and lifted up her voice
with the energy of a steam horn. This lady was
well-known on the Lead as an adept with her
fists, and she had also been observed to indulge In
fermented liquor on an occasion or two. One
night, after a particularly good time, Burnett’s
chairman, noticing her in the audience, signalled
her out, and asked: “Won’t you come up and
sign, Sister L ?" “No 1 ” emphatically re-
plied Sister L . “And whv not. Sister?”
Sister upended, and answered pointedly: ‘‘Be-
cause I like my beer 1 ” This was unanswerable,
and Sister L was troubled no more.

A howling drunk was held lately at a
N’.S.W. bao»- mocks pub. kept by a worthy child
3f the Emerald Isle. It was the finishing touch
to the local race-meeting, and every man was in
ills merriest mood, till one son of a gun loudly
tapped the table and announced a toast. Silence
reigned for a moment, and having been lifted to
bis feet he hiccoughed out, “To hell with the
Pope!" The silence which precedes death
reigned around till a gintleman with a green
necktie and pimpled nose arose solemnly and
announced that he bad a toast to propose,
which he did. It was “to hell with King
Billy !" Matters were about getting warm when
the landlord thought it high time to interfere in
order to prevent bloodshed, and he blandly an-
nounced, in a brogue thick enough to cut with a
knife, that he also had a toast to propose, and it
was “To hell wid the whole of yez.” The land-
lord’s sally restored ordher, and the night was
finished in the orthodox manner.

they were, however, and Morok and Hales came

Judging from the meagre particulars to
hand respecting Sullivan and Mitchell’s fight at
Chantilly, the Slugger’s reputation as a fistic
phenomenon is consi*erably tarnished. Ib may
be trus enough that he had all the bast of what
fighting actually took place, and that tbe ring
was ridlcnlocs’y large, but the fact remains that
he was in a ring for three hours wthout being
able to knock cut his opponent. Tae most ex-
haustive cablegram report says that Mitchell
stood up gamely ia the 6th and 7th rounds an*
“ succeeded In rep'atedly hitting Sullivan, whe ’
went down frequently." Very significant is the j
further stat:ment that ‘ afier the seventh mud
both men seemed to sob on the rnfmEive and
appeared to be unwilling to come to close
qdarters again." As far as one cm read be-
tween the lines, Mitchell opened in rather fai at -
hearted style, and received a lot of his punish-
ment in the first two rounds, but as he gained
confidence the Slugger began to hre it. Anyway,
this much-puffed gentleman—eo aggressive and
invincible with gloves on—has, for the first time in
his life, acted on the defensive. For some years
Americans have been forming conjectures
respecting what “ John L." would do wi r h any
man who had the temerity to mset him with bare
knuckles. John, himself, shared in these dread
misgivings, and on the Sunday before the event
he attended Cathedral service because, “ perhaps,
ha might kill Mitchell.’ But Mitchell, a two-
stone lighter man than his opponent, still lives,
and moves, and has his being. We not'ce
that certain Australian papers regard this
fight as a triumphant proof of Sullivan’s
superiority in the noble art, but The
Bulletin begs to surmise that it has gone
far to burst up the champ on’s boom. When the
Smith Kilrain affair was cabled, our Press gene-
rally accspted it as a desperate and stubbtruly
contested battle, instead of the miserable “fake”
promptly denounced in a Bulletin jingle. We
are not now questioning the sp’eadidphisique and
activity of Sullivan, but are maintaining that be
is not a great prizj-fighter, as the term was under-
stood twenty-five year i ago, in the heyday
of the ring. Does atyone Imagine that
Heenan would have been “ unwilling to come
to close quarters " with Mitchell after fighting six
rounds ? B ih! Just now there is a lot of money
in prize-fighting, and likely men are being eagerly

When the M.C C. entertained Vernon,
Stoddart, and Co. at dinner, last week, the health

was drunk in solemn silence, “by way of respect
for the memory of the late Emperor of Germany."
For grovelling absurdity that just about takes the
cake. If they must drag her name forward at a

sing “God save the Queen” when another

that he kept eight servants, and occasionally
varied the monctocy of dinner en famille by
chucking a leg of pork or a saddle of mutton at
the lady of the bouse. After all, it is as well that
Australian bookmaking should be developing into

It 1s painfully evident that the new blood
introduced into Australian elevens is poor, thin
stuff compared with matured fluid. Last week
two teams, which included all our avai'able
talent (except Gififen, Jarvis, and Spoffortb), were
pitted against Englishmen, at Sydney and Mel-
bourne, They were ea?h badly beatejj, but it is
onrlotK co notice how the “representative" men
cowered over the new comers. At Sydney, the
veterans Blaokham, Jones, and M‘Donn?ll scored
147 oat of 190, and 164 out of 267. At Melbourne,
Bruce, M'llwralth. and Trunable made 68 out of
81, and 60 out of 135, being the only mm to ob-
tain double figures in both innings. The fifth

Wollongong (5.8. W.) show for the best “ boy-
horseman under 14 years of age, with turnout."
A protest was entered against the winner of the
second prize on the ground that the boy was
above the specified age. Hi) sire, who wears a
reverend sort of countenance, deposed before the
committee that the boy was aged 14 years and 5
months. Thereon the committee adjudicated by
resolution that, as horses' ages are dated from the
first of August, the youth would not be beyond
14, in a sporting sense, till next Angus 1 -, whereon
the protest was dismissed. It is needless to say
that the committee, as a rule, belong to the
“ unco guid." The decision is final, other wls* the
aggrieved says he would take the matter to a judge
of the Supreme Court —to wit, W. J. Foster The
wonder is ho tv the committee managed to be pos-
sessed of so much sporting information.

Governor Wobioson, of South Australia,
states that “ he thinks colonial boys are rather
longer in the legs and not quite so rosy in the face,
but in moral attributes and character they are
the same ai English boys.” We are obliged to
Wrblnaon, but why he is so anxious to reduce
everything to an English standard we really don’t
know. We were always of opinion that Wobin-
sol himself was longer in the legs and not quite
so jellow in the countenance as Koo-Too, a very
respactab’e Chinaman in the next street to our
office, but we wouldn’t have mentioned it if he
had kept quiet. As to his character, we decline
to institute comparisons.
A correspondent writes:
Years ago there was a white man in the Queensland town
where I reside, who lived by growing and s -nicg vegetables
He got on moderately we’l for a long time, and then a
yellow son of Shem from the Hoang-Ho came along and
started in opposition. He underso!d the European and
ruined his trade. The alleged w hite men of the place woull
have cursed all creation if they had teen compelled to work
for less ttan, say, 40i a week, but they had no Idea of giving
anyb dy else the same opportunity as they demanded for
themselves. The white man charged tor bis wans ji st
enough to give hin the rate of wages which his countrymen
wanted, but they apparently concluded that he had no right
to so miioh, and went in for saving a few coppers by
patronising the Mongol, who was sathfi d with 15s. a week,
with dirt and leprosy th own in. The Chinaman has grown
rich since then—as Chinamen understand richer—and hii
former rival is now building a humpy for him and his wife—
a white woman who is in gaol. Toe contract price for
the structura is £2 which means about ss. a week for the
