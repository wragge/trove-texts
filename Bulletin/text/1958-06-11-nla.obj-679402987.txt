THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA
Considerable discussion went on in
“The Bulletin” office as to the best
way of reviewing Angus and Robert-
son’s colossal new ten-volume
Australian Encylepaedia: this reviewer’s
suggestion that lit should be given ten
years off to read it was not received
with the enthusiasm it deserved.
The obvious course was to call in a
team of experts to discuss its various
phases: and, in fact, it would not
have been difficult, drawing from “The
Bulletin” staff, the universities and
round Australia generally, to find
sufficient experts to discuss, say, litera-
ture, art, history, economics, the abori-
gines, politics, cricket, racing and
so on.
But one objection to that was that
a good many of the experts are known
to have contributed to the encyclo-
paedia and could hardly be expected to
criticise themselves, except with due
approval. If you set a rival expert to
catch the expert, as must eventually
be done so that truth may prevail, you
would undoubtedly get some useful
and lively remarks. But a mere list of
errors and omissions in particular sub-
jects would be far from an adequate
review of the grand design and scope
of the encyclopaedia as a whole. You
would still barely have touched the
6200 topics from “Abbott, Edward
(1772-1844), soldier” to “Zygophyl-
lacae, a family of herbs and shrubs,”
which the encyclopaedia includes.
You could, of course, evade all diffi-
culties simply by quoting various statis-
tics about the production ; an immense
and invaluable labor on which Angus
and Robertson have been engaged since
1950. But “The Bulletin” has already
had all that in an article from the
general-editor, Bruce W. Pratt, and
similar articles by Alec H. Chisholm,
the editor-in-chief, have been seen in
the press all over the country. The
encyclopaedia discusses, as one has
already said, 6200 subjects, including
bristle-worms; it contains 4,500,000
words ; there were 400 expert contri-
butors ; there are 2200 biographies
(twice as many as in Serle) ; there are
1600 entries on flora and fauna, 1400
geographical entries (including a note
on Warralillialillialillia); and so on
. . . and if one repeats these large and
beautiful statistics here it is only
because one refuses to be altogether
deprived of so tempting a method of
reviewing it. All you have to do is
to pick them out of the introduction.
But when that has been said, it has
been said. Figures are not, after all,
really as impressive as they should be ;
and, massive and resplendent, the ten
great volumes lie scattered all over the
reviewer’s table, and on the desk
nearby, and blocking the hole in
the wall where the telephone comes
through, still patiently awaiting their
review.
On the whole, discarding the ideas
of a panel of experts or ten years off
to read it, the best solution seemed to
be to skim through the volumes, doing
some sort of general survey that would
at least give the reader a fair picture
of it. But at this point, by a fatal
mischance, one came across the last
issue of “Quadrant” where the editor,
expressing in advance his own doubts
about the possibility of adequately
reviewing it, says:^-
Who could possibly review the
whole of it with credit to himself —•
. except of course a journalist merely
picking out the odd and amusing?
And that’s about the end of that.
One is not going to be a mere jour-
nalist picking out the odd and amusing
. . . however tempting it may be to
juxtapose the pop-flower, pork-produc-
tion, Port Essington and R. S. Porteous.
It is. clearly, impossible to review
it at all.
And what remains to be said about
it, once the inadequacy of all methods
of reviewing it has been admitted?
Well, there is—or there can be —a
certain mystique in the publication of
an encyclopaedia. They can be, as some
of them are, a publisher’s potboiler,
scraped together anyhow for a wide
popular sale; or, like Dr. Johnson’s
dictionary, they can be a National
Event, summing-up the life of a nation.
And, even from a hasty glance at “The
Australian Encyclopaedia,” few people
would have any doubts that this is
one of the Events; a major event not
only in Australian publishing but in
the summing-up and dissemination of
the Australian culture as a whole. In
fact, we may reflect with a certain com-
placence that, even if we can hardly
claim to have created this continent
or invented the aboriginal mythology,
it is no small achievement in 170 years
to have done enough interesting and
important things to fill the best part of
ten volumes in an encyclopaedia. This
is not only a book; it is Us.
And it must be said that Angus and
Robertson have made us look very
handsome. And also durable. The
volumes make a fine, robust set in
their red buckram decorated with gold
lettering; and the type, in spacious
double-columns on nicely opaque
paper, is easily and generously legible.
A. H. Chisholm says in his foreword
that it was part of the editorial policy
to make the contents readable in style
as well as in format, and what this
reviewer has read of them confirms
him. There are even touches of humor
at times, color in descriptive articles,
a general pithiness and clarity. The
illustrations, some in color and many
in black-and-white, help considerably,
of course, to lighten it; and these!
whether photographs on art-paper or
line-drawings scattered through the
text, are reproduced with admirable
clearness, avoiding that fusty and
infinitely secondhand look which so
often spoils the illustrations in publica-
tions of this kind.
And then the contents. Perhaps after
all, whatever the temptations of the
odd and the amusing, it is possible
to run through Vol. 10, which is a
general index, to give some idea of the
range of subject-matter.
The index begins with the A.A.U.
of A., which turns out to be the Ama-
teur Athletic Union of Australasia;
then there is the A.8.C.; there are
Aborigines (twelve contributors have
written on them, says the introduction,
“thereby providing the most compre-
hensive summary of the subject ever
presented’’); there are Adelaide, “Aus-
tralia Will Be There (song)” and Air
Services. But, before you get to Azur-
ite, there are 22 pages of A’s.
The B’s begin with the 8.C.A., which
is the Bush Church Aid Societies; then
the British Commonwealth Occupation
Forces; the Banks, Bankruptcy, “The
Banjo,” the Bag-shelter Moth and the
Borovansky Ballet. The C’s likewise
start with a barrage of impressive
abbreviations, C.A.C. and C.A.E. (the
Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation
and the Council of Adult Education);
then, amongst all the others, Canberra,
the Cackling Hawk, Cactoblastis, Caro-
line Chisholm, Chifley, and the Chalet
at Mt. Kosciusko.
The D’s —you could go on like this
for pages; but perhaps it is enough to
say that, in search of the Z’s, one found
the W’s adorned with Water Conserva-
tion, Mrs. Martin Wang (a celebrity
totally unknown to this reviewer) and
the water-parsnip; and the Z’s, when
eventually one got to that unpromising
letter, managed quite a respectable
array beginning with Zaglossus, which
is something zoological, and so to
Zebu Cattle, Zeus Australis (a fish),
Zoological Gardens, Ephraim Lamen
Zox (he was a Melbourne philanthro-
pist and politician who wore side-
whiskers) and, to end on as solid a
note as possible, the Zinc Corporation.
There are, as one never tires of
repeating, 6200 entries. This reviewer,
feeling that he should test at least one
of them, looked-up the references to
Hugh McCrae. McCrae is mentioned
nine times in the course of the volumes,
which is not bad going for a poet; the
date of his birth is given correctly;
and there is an admirable, if necessarily

STRANGE CROSSROADS
VX/TTH the Federal elections at most
six months away, and perhaps
closer, all political parties in the Com-
monwealth are at an interesting cross-
roads.
The schisms of Labor following the
Petrov Commission and the extra-
ordinary Red-herrings of dissension
produced by Dr. Evatt, as Federal
leader, appear at present to threaten it
with complete disunity. Labor has
been defeated as two splinter-sections
at the Queensland elections, and it has
again suffered defeat at the Victorian'
elections. In Tasmania the lottery
scandals and other matters seem calcu-
lated to overcome even proportional-
representation in defeating Labor. And
Mr. Cahill’s grand tour of the U.S.A.
must have its moments of bitter
reflection as he contemplates returning
to an election-campaign in N.S.W.
With the increase of population and
the growth of industrial prosperity it
becomes increasingly difficult for Labor
to put-up a case for its ancient plat-
form. It is also becoming increasingly
difficult for Labor to foresee a future
for itself on the basis even of oppor-
tunism. Fixed-trust investment, motor-
transport availability, long annual holi-
days, a standard of living which tends
to bring the worker into the realm of
the living-standards of the middle
class, high-school education, mechani-
sation, electronics and electrification
are all fast whittling away the distinc-
tion between the laborer and the white-
collar worker.
The bowyang is extinct; the dungaree
and the jeans are becoming as much
the outfit of the sweet girl-undergradu-
ate as of the man of honest sweat whose
“slavery” was the excuse for Labor’s
existence.
The newest element which Labor has
to combat, and which is still an
unknown quantity in politics, is the
New Australian. He would not be
here in his present bulk if Labor had
only known. But it plumped for the
European at a stage in politics when
Australia had become a little Russian-
mad under the influence of a Red-
controlled Post-war Reconstruction
set-up and a highly impressionable
press. The New Australian was to
provide the icing on Labor’s political
cake, the solid bloc of votes of those
who had gone through the travail of
life at minimum standards in Europe,
reinforced by a course of Belsen or
Ravensbruck or Dachau.
OUT it didn’t work out like that. The
** bulk of the immigrants regarded
a country with plenty of work as a
heaven and the Australian scale of
wages as in the luxury class.
As they have worked and saved and
become prosperous they have already
begun to influence the outlook of their
fellow-Australians by showing them
the advantages of the industrious
European habits of busyness and
saving.
In some centres where many New
Australians work beside Old Aus-
tralians the contrast is still marked, but
the gap between the two outlooks is
narrowing, with the European outlook
a strong influence. Also winning is
the outlook which Europeans have
brought with them on Communism:
almost to a man they hate it.
Labor, of course, understands these
things, and it realises that its power to
win elections is temporarily inhibited
and that its future largely depends on
the ability of its predominantly Leftist
leadership to conciliate two factions —•
Catholic Labor and the European-
immigrant vote and that of its immedi-
ate descendants, some of whom are
beginning to appear at the ballot-box.
It is strange that the party’s chance
of survival depends very much on
adopting, at least temporarily, the line
of the splinter Democratic Labor Party,
which it ejected as a conspiratorial
element, the plaything of Catholic
Action and other subverters of the
“purity” of Labor. But a little bit of
acrobatics like that will not worry the
A.L.P. Federal Executive.
A LL the efforts of internal Labor are
being directed towards this end.
As the N.S.W. A.L.P. Conference
approaches, this fact becomes more and
more obvious. The enlargement of the
N.S.W. Executive, for instance, would
pave the way for the inclusion of some
weighty characters who in the not-so-
distant past were vomited out of the
movement as poison—or vomited
themselves out because they thought
that Evatt, Ward and Haylen were
poison.
All would like unity before an
election —the Left as well as the
extreme religious Right and industrial-
group elements. They all know that
until there is unity each fresh election
means another trek in the arid wastes
of Opposition.
The present efforts for Labor unity
are no doubt giving the Government
and the Liberal and Country parties
some concern.
Each side in the Labor unity-moves
privately waters-down its aspirations
that brotherly love reign once more
with the thought that the private
murder of a faction may be more
decently and safely committed within
the shelter of the party-rooms than
in a public civil-war in the presence
of the common enemy. Thus it is
possible that at least a truce may
be achieved before an election if the
poll is delayed long enough, leaving
the fight to be renewed internally when
the votes have been counted.
TTNDER the circumstances the
Menzies Government might be at
an advantage if it went to the country
early, but with the economy as it is the
full effects of drought and recession are
not likely to make a full impact until
after December, and in the meantime a
liberal Budget with tax-reductions, aid
to reconstruction and restocking, and
generosity in road- and housing-
subsidies might happily round-off Sir
Arthur Fadden’s extraordinary career
as Treasurer.
Whether Labor can come together
without ditching its Federal leader is
at present the overriding question. It
appears almost impossible that it can,
especially in view of the fact that the
Communist party insists on regarding
him as its leader also in the sphere of
pure Labor politics. Certainly any
united party led by him would cast
him for the role of Humpty Dumpty
in the Christmas political pantomime.
The all-round prospect is not a
happy one politically. No Parliament
is effective without a strong Opposi-
tion, and splinter-parties are especially
destructive, since they always lend
themselves to disorderly legislating and
political manoeuvre by caves ready to
sell their support for some specific
purpose. .
It would be a good thing if moderate
Labor could begin to rebuild, or if
there were a resurgence of old-fashioned
Liberalism championing the cause of
the individual outside the aspirations
of Socialism and the current drift to
the Left.
Labor elements would probably do
better for themselves if they realised
that the day of sectional Labor politics
is over and that there is room in the
unions for all kinds of political opinion.
Nothing would do more towards pro-
ducing universal unionism than a
depoliticalisation of the union-move-
ment which would admit supporters of
other parties to the government of the
unions, now the perquisite of Labor
political supporters and/or Communists.


IN A CANBERRA GARDEN


PLAIN ENGLISH
Melbourne's Response
[From “Collins Street”]
I was one of the privates in Campaign
Door-knock, the canvass of every house-
hold in Greater Melbourne and beyond,
for the Anti-Cancer Appeal now current
in Victoria, and my experiences make me
wonder if Melburnians aren’t at least
among the most charitable citizens in the
world.
The organisers have no doubt where
they rank in Australia. The Anti-Cancer
Appeal, which set-out to raise £500,000
and, with some weeks to go, has £620,000
in the kitty, is being conducted, for Aus-
tralian research, treatment and publicity,
in Victoria only, although the Tasmanian
liquor-trade has put itself down for
£lO,OOO, and included in a gift of £50,000
from the noted McKay (Sunshine
Harvester) family is £lO,OOO from H. V.
McKay, the N.S.W. grazier.
In Campaign Door-knock my lieu-
tenant was the local tobacconist’s
daughter and the captain a real-estate
agent; the upper hierarchy didn’t con-
cern me. Eight of us met the lieutenant
at 6.50 p.m. to receive final instructions
on a street-corner, and I had noted on
the way to the meeting that every house
had its outside lighting switched-on for
the expected callers.
My territory was eight buildings,
including three blocks of flats, and, aside
from two duds, every doorway was lit
for us, and most of the citizens came to
answer our knocks with their cheques,
fivers, pounds and ten-bob notes in their
hands (which my young daughter stuffed
rather too eagerly in her purse, I thought),
with offers of every sort of drink and,
more than once, with a quite affecting
gladness that they could give what was
to them a substantial sum.
There is an unusually high propor-
tion of doctors in our district, and they
were the most generous givers of all as
a class. They are, of course, very much
more aware of the cruelty and incidence
of cancer than others, but they are
possibly the worst hit, of the professions
at least, by inflation.
Our instructions were that the field-
campaign must be completed between
7 p.m. and 9 p.m., but we all finished
before time, handed in our counted
money and our receipted lists at the
tobacconist’s home, and were drinking
coffee when we realised our own contri-
butions had not been collected at our
doors.
The captain, when telephoned, said two
privates had deserted, and we tossed-off
our coffee and collected in a few minutes
another. £6O at doorways where the lights
had been left on to beckon us.
The target for our suburb was £BOO,
and £12,000 was handed over at the door-
ways. I was not surprised, although the
total for the night, £285,000, really was
a stunner. More rewarding than any-
thing for me was the enriching, first-hand
experience of the depth of Melbourne’s
generosity and manners. I had only read
about it before.
France's Test Begins
The advent of de Gaulle has not yet
had its full impact. Only the formulas of
his policy have been stated, and it will
be months before the internal and
external results of the trial of them are
evident.
He has two great assets, apart
from the strength of the military
forces which everybody connected with
the coup desires to forget except the
Army and Navy and Air Force them-
selves.
One is the fact that with nearly-full
employment in France, a place by the
home-fires must appear to the most
violent revolutionary more comfortable
than a place at the barricades. Insurrec-
tion feeds on want and economic adver-
sity. The second is that the new leader
is an acknowledged patriot with the
COWS, AND HOW TO
MILK THEM—page SO.
kind of slogans for sale that always
go down in Trance. In Algeria he has
a further card to play in his promise of
equality of rights to French and Moslems
alike.
The fact that de Gaulle chose Algeria
for his first major public declarations of
policy outside the Assembly, under the
shelter of the faithful Army, shows how
much he and his followers feel that the
consolidation of his regime depends
largely on his being able to state his
views without the interruption of Com-
munist resistance such as he might face
in Paris.
The sullen quietness of the Com-
munists and of the Arab League on the
French question does not mean inactivity.
Their agents and radio are making hay
in North Africa and in the Middle East,
and the pressure of plot and riot, and.
intervention of the United Arab Republic
in the affairs of Lebanon with intent to
take over the strategic coast of the
Mediterranean and the key city of Beirut
speak for themselves.
The Lebanese complaint to the
Security Council instances such acts as
“infiltration of armed bands from Syria
into Lebanon, the destruction of life
and property by such bands, the supply
of agitators and arms from Syria, the
intensive radio and press programme
organised from Syria to develop civil
strife.” But the Arab League is not at
all unanimous about Nasser's destructive
and undermining operations.
De Gaulle’s principles, as far as they
affect Algeria and aim for a resurgence
of France’s greatness, seem to have been
born of developments which began after
the defeats of Indo-China. They have
been moderately well received in Algeria,
but in France everything will depend on
there being no false steps during the
four months or so that will elapse before
the new Government submits to the
electors reforms based on a revised
Article 90 of the Constitution.
The proposed reforms are based on
three specifically stated principles:
(«) That universal suffrage is the source
of all authority.
(6) That the executive and legislative
powers must be effectively separated, so
that both Government and Parliament
carry, each on its own account and under
its own responsibility, the fullness of its
authority.
(c) The Government must be respon-
sible to Parliament.
With the vote on a scheme based on
these principles will go the plan for
settling the Algerian question and
laying-down the basis of future relation-
ships between European and overseas
France. France will vote on them
together.
The path to tranquillity, beset wi.th
all the issties of self-interest and Com-
munist agitation, apart from the eternal
conflict between Socialism and Con-
servatism and religion and its various
types of opponent, is far from smooth
or well illuminated. In the early stages,
at any rate, both de Gaulle and Western
Europe, from which the economic
response has been calm, have reason to
be thankful that the new Government
leads from strength and has a solid
military backing to assure submission
of its plans. If those plans are rejected
either a dictatorship or chaos must follow.
Local-government Challenge
Demands from the central west of N.S.W,
for a referendum, or, failing that, an
independent judicial inquiry into pro-
posed forced amalgamations of shires
and municipal councils in that area, have
not so far produced much response from
the Cahill Government; but last week
the Opposition parties came out strongly
against the Renshaw Plan.
In a joint statement Opposition-leader
Morton and Country-party leader Davis
Hughes undertook, if returned to office
at the next election, to put an end to
the present system of changing local-
government boundaries. Both have
expressed views on this subject before,
but this time they made their attitude
clear beyond all doubt.
Calling on the Government to halt,
until after the elections, all amalgama-
tions not specifically approved by the
people, they said it was apparent that the
intention was “to destroy the structure
of local-government through municipal
councils and shire councils, as we know
it, and replace them with regional coun-
cils covering vast areas and a diversity
of interests.” The ultimate purpose was
to centre all control in Sydney.
The Opposition-leaders said that a
Liberal-Country-party Government would
allow amalgamation only where there was
a demand for it from the people and
councils concerned. When an amalgama-
tion was requested, an independent com-
mission not responsible to the Minister
and not comprised of departmental heads
would investigate the proposal.
A referendum would be taken on
demand from the electors in the areas
concerned and when amalgamation pro-
posals were rejected no further action
would be taken.
These promises, which cover virtually


all the points sought by the people of
the central west at the public meeting
held in Bathurst on May 27, should give
new hope not only to citizens in the
Lithgow-Bathurst-Orange area, but also
to those of the Goulburn and Dubbo
districts, believed to be next on the list
of shotgun-weddings. They are not so
likely to please the sitting Labor members
for Goulburn and Dubbo, both of whom
won by a mere handful of votes in 1956.
Minister for Local Government Ren-
shaw has not commented on the joint
statement beyond remarking that he will
have something to say on the subject of
a boundaries commission at the annual
conference of the Shires Association
which opens today. If his something
turns out to be merely a couple of depart-
mental officers decked-out in new suits
the shire presidents will no doubt have
a few home-truths to tell him.
The Budget
[From Canberra)
The Government is in a real quandary
over its 1958-59 Budget.
It wants an election-winner, with some-
thing for everyone, but the trend in its
overseas trade and very heavy loan-
redemptions falling due between now
and December are giving it second
thoughts about tax-concessions.
As yet it is too early to predict what
the outcome will be, as the Treasury
backroom boys are now just getting down
to the details, and Cabinet won’t consider
the Budget, even in its preliminary form,
until early next month.
But one thing stands out clear. The
Budget will not be as “liberal” as was
thought four or five months ago.
Provisions the Government has to make
this year include probably £IOO million
for States works-programmes, heavier
social-service payments and almost £3OO
million in loan-redemptions.
And the bondholders are not, in the
majority, big concerns which convert their
holdings into new bonds.
They are mainly small bondholders
who have taken long-term Government
bonds at the comparatively low interest-
rate of about 5 p.c., but who might
now prefer to cash their bonds
and invest them in short-term loans with
hire-purchase and other finance com-
panies at 7 p.c. or 8 p.c.
This is the big problem facing the
Government in this 1958 election-year.
The size of the handout to the electors
may depend on whether or not the
Treasury wizards can pull one out of the
hat which will persuade the majority of
bondholders not to take out their cash
but reinvest it with the Commonwealth.
Bolte and the C.P.
Victorian Liberals had hardly tossed-
up a sound win in the Legislative
Assembly elections than they had to
open a second, and probably easier, cam-
paign, to win eight seats in the Legislative
Council elections on June 21.
There are 34 seats in the Upper House,
and, with 10 in hand, eight will give Bolte
an absolute majority as well as providing
a President, the post now held by Sir
Clifden Eager, the very independent
Liberal.
On the Assembly voting, the Liberals
can expect to win the provinces of
Monash, Ballarat, Western, South-western
and South-eastern, and may have more
than reasonable prospects in Bendigo,
Southern and the difficult Eager seat
of-East Yarra.
Once more the D.L.P. vote will be
vital. The party lost Richmond, its only
seat in the Assembly elections, and on
that voting must be prepared to lose
its four seats, Melbourne North, Mel-
bourne West and Melbourne (to the
A.L.P.) and Monash (to the Liberals), thus
losing all seats in the Victorian Parlia-
ment ; but its preferences again will
decide the Government’s success.
The preferences will be of significant
value to the Liberals in Ballarat, Bendigo,
Southern, South-eastern, South-western
and Western, and if they succeed in
establishing the Government’s command
of the Council it will end, at long last,
the minority dictation in the Victorian
Parliament of the Country party which
in the past three years has been enforc-
ing unpalatable action in the Assembly
because its members in the Council could
decide the fate of Government measures.
The most unpleasant facet of the last
Parliament was the calling of the tune
by a party of 10 members in a Lower
House of 66.
Dual Control
Every day the traffic tangles and muddles
of the greater Australian cities increase
and multiply, and it has taken a long time
for even one authority to put a finger on
the root-cause.
Sydney is the worst example. The
basic trouble is duality of control. It
has taken a trip abroad to bring the light
to one of the controllers, Alderman
Jensen, Sydney’s Lord Mayor, who has
made the discovery that until traffic and
parking are controlled by one authority
chaos will continue to grow.
With police and councils dividing the
work the Mad Hatter would find a con-
genial sphere in parking-traffic manage-
ment of Sydney in particular.
Overseas it is easier because police are
usually under municipal control, so that
these matters come under one hand. In
Sydney and other States, municipalities
and police have their separate tasks, and
the main preoccupation when anything
unpopular needs to be done is how to pass
the buck. But the share-up of booty is
managed pretty well.
The police run the irritating job of
controlling traffic-flow, speeding, jay-
walking, etc., and collect a nice lump of
money in fines for the State during the
year, incidentally swelling the number
of “criminals” listed by the Police Com-
missioner, and —necessarily, since the
public is not helpful-making a lot of
enemies. Nothing detracts so much from
the popularity of the Police Force as the
necessity for applying traffic regulations
according to the individual interpretations
of constables in a city of chaos.
The Sydney City Council has only just
really begun to cash-in on the traffic-
revenue grab. The footpaths are now
lined thickly with parking-meters. Sub-
urban councils are thinking of following
suit, and the habit has spread to other
cities.
One feature which has not been tackled
at all is the growing nuisance in every
residential suburb of night-parking and
weekend car-washing. Any householder
any weekend may find himself landed
with a New Australian naked to the
waist diligently washing his truck at the
front-door with buckets and rags all over
the footpath and perhaps hung on the
fence or wall.
The idea that the matter, along with
pavement-parking, may have to be dealt
with will be allowed to wait until the
thing is beyond control. Nobody in any
municipality in Sydney seems to have
thought of providing metered water and
facilities in suburban lanes along the
line of back-fences or of general washing-
and parking-facilities for suburban owners
who have no garages. Yet some measure
of this sort will be necessary if residential
streets in more thickly populated areas
are not to be surfaced with oil and debris.
Imports
[From Canberra)
A sharp clamp-down on imports from
January 1 next is now looming as a
distinct possibility—but not before
January 1.
Australia’s overseas trade has taken a
downward plunge in the current finan-
cial year (compared with 1956-57), and
there do not seem to be any signs of it
improving in the near future.
In the 11 months to the end of May
this year Australia recorded a favorable
balance in merchandise trading of only
£36,800,000 ; at the same time in 1956-57
the favorable balance was £250,400,000.
Add to, or subtract from, this year’s
balance, “invisibles,” such as freight and
insurance charges, around about £IOO
million for the full year, and it can be
seen Australia will be well to the bad.
The reason for the slump is very
evident —the ever-increasing demand for
imports, which the Government has
been allowing to increase gradually dur-
ing the year, and the fall in export
values.
In the 11 months to the end of May
this year imports were valued at
£728,600,000, compared with £663,100,000
in the comparable 11 months of 1956-57.
Not only have the imports jumped up,
but export-returns, due to a number of
factors —but mainly the fall in wool
prices—have dropped from £913,500,000
in the 11 months’ period of 1956-57 to
only £765,400,000 in the 11 months to
May this year.
Unless between now and the end of
this calendar-year the Government can
boost exports appreciably —and this will
have to come mainly from secondary
industries —restrictions are likely to be
tightened as from the beginning of the
licensing-period on January 1.
Why not before January 1?
Because between now and then there
will be a Federal election.

A ccounts of America’s preparations
for celebrating Father’s Day (June
15 in the U.S.A.) make ours seem tame.
Here the most Dad can hope for is
a pair of socks, or a tie that could
conceivably be worn on a cold dark night

U.S. a National Father’s Day Committee
selects a “Father of the Year” —this year
President Eisenhower’s youngest brother.
If you miss this top award there are
other chances of distinction: you may
be chosen as TV father of the year,
radio father, stage father, literary father,
sports father, and so on. We could do
it here, with suitable regard for popular
Australian activities. What a thrill to be
picked as political father of the year,
punting father, football father, union

off. That was about 11 a.m. It was
about 3 p.m. when we boarded a tram
for home, but being a section further
the fare was 7d. each. I had the right
money for our total fares of Is. 2d. 1

THE IDEAL TO BE AIMED AT
“With the congestion of London streets, the
heyday of the buses is over. We must get the

Transport-lords are curious cusses,
Fashion rules their changing day ;
While Sydney apes the London buses
London gives the bus away:
“Buses? They’re passe. They’re
unsound.
We must get people underground.”
Yet putting people there is what
You’d think the present system’s for;
Crosses reiterate the spot,
Fatalities grow more and more —
Leave all the plans upon the shelf,
The problem still might solve itself.

Towards the inevitable tomb
We need not stoop to dig with lowly

There’s better ways than being moles
Or making large, expensive holes.

/''vUR rag reported the arrival, for
the opening of the duck-season, of
a general, a captain and a major who
were to be housed at one of our best
hostelries. The drink-waiter was to act
as batman, call them at 2.45 a.m., and
serve them with hot buttered toast and
tea. The v.i.p.s were to be provided with
a boat for the recovery pf the bodies of
the enemy, and after the cease-fire they
were to have frankfurts and bread with
plenty of butter.
This seemed to me poor fare for ser-
vicemen on such a hazardous encounter
and far removed from our luxury life of
1914. Before we set out on our nightly
leave from Liverpool the C.O. would say
“Gentlemen,” —he always called us gentle-
men, although we were not of the Light
Horse—“the cars will be waiting to take
you to the station; have a nice time
and if any of those railway cads ask you
for your fare tell them to charge it to
Kitchener.” On our return by the last
train the C.O. would personally supervise
our supper of lobster, sucking-pig, aspara-
gus or quail-on-toast washed down with
well-laced coffee.
I remember, on our return one very
wet night, his concern, and his remark,
“Why ever, gentlemen, did you come
back to camp on such a wet night? Why
ever didn’t you stay in the city for a day
or two until the rain had ceased and
the ground dried-out? You couldn’t help
getting wet going from the train to the
cars —however, reveille will not be
sounded iii the morning, but should any
of you wish to get up for breakfast will
you kindly leave your names at the
orderly-room, when you will be called
and your bath prepared? Those of you
who would rather sleep-in will be given
breakfast in bed. I trust,- however, that
it will be convenient for you all to attend
afternoon parade, as you should know
something of the rifle and its use.”

afterwards. Rumor had it that his body
was found in Cook’s River. I don’t know
what would have happened had the C.O.
learned that we had been subjected to
the indignity of bayonet-fighting drill.
After this drill the instructor, an Imperial
R.S.M., said, “Now I’ve taught you all
there is to know about bayonet-fighting,
is there any questions?” When I said,
“Yes, Sarg., how do I get a job in the

THE PRESS
From an address by the Governor-General,
SIR WILLIAM SLIM.
at the opening of the new Journalists’ Cluh building, Sydney, On April 12.
I thank you very much for
your hospitality and for
your warm welcome, and
the way in which you have
so pleasantly arranged for me
to “Meet the Press” —rather in
contrast with some of my
friends who have appeared
on TV.
I was delighted when I
arrived to see so many of your
guests I know well, but I was
a little sorry to think that so
many members were relegated
to the lower regions of the
second-floor.
I made a certain number of
inquiries about this club and
1 discovered it' holds one or
two very good records. One
of them is that, throughout the
war, you never closed, night or
day. The only other institu-
tion that holds that record is
the Windmill Club in London.
I toyed with the idea of how
agreeable it would have been
if only you could have had a
joint • meeting of the two
institutions on this happy
occasion. I reluctantly
abandoned the idea . . . which
was just as well, because I am
Governor-General.
As I have gone about Aus-
tralia, I have seen a fair bit
of the gentlemen and ladies of
the press doing the'ir job while
I have been trying to do mine,
and I have come to the con-
clusion that, although you
stand there and say “Look this
way!” and “Do it again!” I
do not think you are so diffi-
cult taskmasters as I must be
as a subject of your pens—still
more your cameras.
I know it is often said that
Australian journalists are a
terribly tough lot and rather
frightening but I have not
found it so.
You perform, as far as I
am concerned, a very useful
function. You deflate the ego
with your candid cameras,
which I hate.
The other day a despairing
young man with a camera
appealed to me and said:
“Smile, sir!” I really had a
great deal of sympathy for him.
1 said, “Damn you, I am
smiling!”
Then there was another
terribly nice young man who
sailed around after me the
whole long day. At last he
said to my A.D.C.: “Can 1
have a word with the
Governor-General?”
My A.D.C. replied, “No, the
Governor-General has nothing
to say.”
The youpg man answered,
“I realise that. I have been
going round with him all day! ”
Then there was the most
engaging young man who said
he had visited the village, in
which I used to live and
Elliott and Fry.
SIR WILLIAM SLIM
had seen me there. One is
always warm-hearted to a
chap who has been in one’s
own village, and I said, “What
was I doing?”
He replied: “Your Excel-
lency was in the fish-queue.”
As a soldier I have happy
memories of many of your
colleagues in war. A number
of Australian journalists visited
me.
I do not know the reader-
effect of what they wrote, or
what remained after it had
passed the sub-editors, but they
had an excellent effect on the
morale of my troops, because
they were a good type of chap.
When I had a press-
conference I used to tell them
quite a lot of background, and
sometimes advance-information
on the understanding that they
did not publish it. before a
deadline.
Never did any of them,
except one (and he was not an
Australian journalist), abuse
my confidence.
I did not have to do any-
thing about that exception. It
was done for me!
And so, if I say anything
unwise or indiscreet, you must
attribute it to the simple and
trusting nature I
developed in the way
in which I was
brought-up by those
war - correspondents.
I once said to one
of them a well-
known English
correspondent and
editor —after watch-
ing him struggle with
the things Public
Relations han d e d
out, “I think it must
be much more diffi-
cult to be a good
journalist than to be
a good general.
After all, there are
many good generals.”
I only tried to be a
good general, and I
found that beyond
my powers at times.
I know it is very
hard indeed to be a
good journalist. It
is very hard to be
really good at any-
thing.
You journalists have certain
pitfalls and obstacles and
temptations in your way that
are peculiar to your profession.
I did think of giving you a
list of them. But then I thought
the melancholy recital of these
things so familiar to you would
be an embarrassment to you.
IX7hile I was cudgelling my
™* brain for something to say
—I knew you would expect me
to sing for my supper—l tried
to think what sort of chap a
really good journalist would
be ; and I added one admirable
quality to another until I got a
chap who was a composite of
Sir Galahad, George Washing-
ton, the Boy David and Charles
Morgan.
And then I was going to add
a distinguished politician. I
was sure you would ask me
to name him—but you fox me
there!
If I included the name of a
politician it would be easy for
column-writers to accuse the
Governor-General of parti-
ality!
I did add to the list of
qualities of the ideal journalist
some bits which I fondly
imagined were the better parts
of my own character, because
we do, when “making a hero,”
add a bit of ourselves.
TTaving put these finishing-
touches to my own jour-
nalist I suddenly remembered
the poor chap had to earn his
living. And so I threw Sir Gala-
had and all the noble company
into the discard because our
good journalist has a little bit
of all of them in him.
And then I made what a
better-known statesman would
call an “agonising reappraisal.”
I realised I guessed wrong the
first time and had better try
again. This time, I thought,
my journalist would better be
a fellow more of the everyday
world—something rather more
a craftsman than the starry-
eyed artist.
After all, it is so much better
to be a first-class craftsman
than a second-class artist,
because such a craftsman is
so much more useful, much
more satisfying—and better
paid! No one has yet suc-
ceeded in saying what is
the dividing-line between a
great artist and a great crafts-
man.
T>Robably the good journalist
was just a decent citizen
who had a job to do and did it
with efficiency and with pride.
I suspect it is much harder
for a journalist today to be
that —and take that pride which
he does—than it was a hundred
years ago, or even fifty years
ago.
I think that is a terrible pity.
The position is, journalists
have not changed. Ido not
suppose they have changed a
bit. It is the newspapers that
have changed:
In the last quarter of the
nineteenth century most British
newspapers and I do not

next meeting of the adjourned National
Assembly. No by-elections will be held
till after the referendum.
The fears of those who expected de
Gaulle to be merely a stooge for the
Army have had no confirmation up to
the present. In differences of opinion
that have so far developed the war-time
leader has come out on top. The position
is that with the assistance of the Army de

away with the necessity for double-
dissolutions.
He suggests that Senators, instead of
being elected for six years, should be
elected for two terms of the House pf

hostile Senate is much less likely to be
hostile if half its members can be forced
to face the electors any time the Govern-

who has acted before as Ike’s special
ambassador and personal representative
on Latin American affairs, is to visit the
six Central American republics. U.S.
representatives in the region have been
asked to report on the probable reaction
to his visit. Their replies have been
favorable. Nevertheless, Vice-President

At the conclusion of the Loan Council
meeting all Premiers paid tribute to
Federal Treasurer Sir Arthur Fadden,
who had presided over the council for
the last time. In view of the publicised
wrangling that attends these periodical
conferences it might be thought that
they were merely paying lip-service to
convention, but this is not the case.
Despite all the slang-whanging and name-
calling at the annual financial talks the
State leaders have genuine respect and
affection for Fadden, and. most Loan
Council meetings have ended on a friendly
note. This one apparently finished, after
kind things had been said about S’Artie
and he had responded, with his telling
the gathering “a good story.” It’s a safe

Probably the bitterest fight in the Legis-
lative Council elections in Victoria will
develop in East Yarra, now held by the
President of the Council, Sir Clifden
Eager, who was disowned by the Liberals
after he had refused to vote for them
against adult franchise for the Council
and the socialist Greater Melbourne bill.
The A.L.P. has not nominated a candi-
date against Eager, so all Labor votes
should go to him. Dick Hamer, the
endorsed Liberal, will have the D.L.P.
preferences, whatever they may be worth
in this very conservative province.
According to Sir Arthur Warner, the
Government’s leader in the Legislative
Council, this A.L.P. support would make
Eager an effective Labor member in the
chamber, and East Yarra is one of the
seats the Government must win to get a
majority in the Upper House.

Although Victorian Liberals regret the
loss of John Stanistreet from the Bendigo
seat, they will welcome back to the
Assembly with anticipatory grins Big
Bill (Lesley William) Galvin, who lost
Bendigo in 1955 by a dozen votes after
having held it for 10 years.
He is a forthright, humorous and at
time inspiriting member and'likely to be
an enlivening influence among a rather
mousey and academic Opposition; the
Labor party lost much of .its punch when
old-timer Laborites such as Barry and
Hayes went to the D.L.P. and then out.
Galvin was Deputy Premier in 1952
and it may not be long before he is at
least deputy-leader of the party again.
Born in Sydney 54 years ago, he went
to Scotch College, Melbourne, and
became a railways engineer, stationed in
Bendigo ; he’s one of the town’s most
popular citizens.
The Nuclear Research Foundation is

high-school science-teachers to show
whether they can teach atomic physics
properly.” The foundation will 'also offer
three Science Faculty scholarships, of
£2OO each, to top students in physics in

Lloyd Ross, secretary of the N. S
Wales branch of the A.R.U., says his
union will declare “piggy-back” transport
black if the Railways Department allows
private road-hauliers to use it. This sys-
tem, recommended by Ebasco, consists
of carrying loaded road-trucks long dis-
tances on flat-top rail-trucks. It enables
the establishment of a door-to-door ser-
vice combining rail- and road-transport.
Ross wants the “piggy-back” set-up to be
purely a Government show, with the rail-
ways owning and running the road-trucks.
If private trucks try to horn-in his union
will declare ’em black.
The same “progressive” spirit is shown
in the A.R.U.’s request to the Railways
Department to cancel a Lismore bus
company's franchise to sell rail-tickets,
on the grounds that it is doing a railway-
man out of a job.

“Kandy”: We may grumble about our
film-censors, but we seem better off than
fellow-sufferers in Ceylon. The spicy
breezes there may be ail right, but nothing
“spicy” is allowed there on film. The
censors have drawn-up a code which
prohibits “excessive kissing and lustful
embraces,” as well as films which will
“lower moral standards or show murder
techniques which can be imitated.” No
details of brutal killings may be screened,
there must be “no undermining of the
sanctity of marriage and the home,” and,
above all, thefe cannot be any “attractive
portraiture of adultery and illicit sex.”
What on earth can their films be about?

“Collins Street”: It is clear from the
Victorian elections that Dr. Evatt has
exasperated thousands of Roman Catho-
lics who normally vote independently into
giving their primaries to the D.L.P., with
the Libs, getting second preferences.
According to the electoral-office grape-
vine at the time, the independent R.C.
vote went Liberal at the 1955 State elec-
tions, but the Doc.’s frequent taunts since
have had their effect; nothing else
explains Bolte’s loss of 27,000 primary
votes this time.
The Liberals still got the second prefer-
ence. The Libs, (all sorts) dropped to
38.77 per cent, of the total vote, compared
with 41.89 ; A.L.P. went up to 36.91 from
32.86 and the D.L.P. from 12.59 to 14.65.
The D.L.P. contested 60 seats this year
compared with 44 in 1955, but didn’t
contest such seats as Too.rak, where the
vote could not possibly affect the issue
by putting out an A.L.P. man.

proposed for a fast, double-tier elevated
roadway between central London and
London airport. The 12|-mile road will
be built on a. viaduct for its first mile-
and-a-half, with single supporting piers.
In its first mile it will cover the Great
West Road like an umbrella, the piers,
with splayed heads, allowing traffic to
pass freely on the difel carriageways
beneath. The upper deck will be part of
the London-to-South Wales motorway,
and the project may carry the new road
over a factory-roof 65ft. high. The
average height will be 25ft., to avoid
wide-scale demolitions.

year’s residence in Westralia, has been
appointed R.S.L. State secretary there.
He is the first naval man, the first New
Zealander, and the first university gradu-
ate to hold the position. His degrees
—B.Sc. and B.E. (Mining and Metal-
lurgy) —are from the N.Z. University. He
joined the Royal N.Z. Naval Volunteer
Reserve in February, 1940, was commis-
sioned in 1942 and appointed Intelligence
Officer for the R.N.Z. Navy in the S.W.
Pacific area. While seagoing he served
in the cruiser Achilles, in minesweepers
and anti-submarine vessels, and was a
lieutenant-commander before he dropped
anchor in civvy-street.

he became chief accountant in 1942, is
past-president of the Victorian Insurance
Institute and a member of the Federal
examiners’ committee. A year or so ago
he took an overseas study where
Britons and Americans were ahead of
Australians in insurance economics.
He is one of the protagonists of the
new bowling-club at the Melbourne
suburb of Ashburton, not because bowls
is the game to play if you want to
live long and keep the insurance com-
panies (and their chief accountant) happy
—he just likes bowls.

His father a Scot (Aberdeenshire), he

young to Australia (in 1887). When
T. D. MUTCH
Frith, in the late 1930'5, drew the accom-
panying sketch of him he had closed the
chapter of his Labor political career,
having finally broken with Jack Lang in
a row that raised, quite a lot of dust from
the Macquarie Street benches at the
time. Before that he had very ably served
Labor and the State —exceptionally well
enough to have been twice Minister for
Education, in different Labor Govern-
ments, with a turn as Minister for Local
Government in yet another Labor Cabinet
in.between. In journalism he was for a
while on The Bulletin staff, had earlier
been A.J.A. chairman, and as well was
an A.J.A. gold-badge holder. He was a
Mitchell Library trustee, and a Fellow
of the Royal Australian Historical
Society, with Pacific and Australasian
historical research his main hobby.

Walsh, of the C.5.1.R.0.’s division of
industrial chemistry, came to Melbourne

chemical-physics- section. His work in
that field has earned him a world reputa-
tion and his new-type spectrophotometer,
manufactured under C.5.1.R.0. licence
in America, has so far earned royalties of
$70,000, and may be produced by an
English manufacturer later this year.
Walsh’s research in the study of light-
absorption by atoms and its possible use
in the analysis of trace-elements in soils
and plants, as well as in metallurgy, has
attracted wide attention overseas. -

“Soc” sees a spaceman:
Saw him in Sydney, as a matter of fact;
in George Street; not a b'it like the comic
artists’ ideas of spacemen; rather what you’d
notice as a very neatly turned-out Sydney-
sider ; spic-and-span; bow-tie; homburg;
carefully groomed; sporty looking; as a col-
league put it, the sort of bloke you might
meet with a penny-ha’penny in his pocket and
who’d still tell you everything was fine and
dandy. The paper he’s with these days, the
N.R.M.A-’s journal, headlined him in its
June 1 issue: “Our Advertising Manager is
‘so’,” and added: “A special tribute to ‘The
Open Road’s’ advertising manager, Mr. W. T.
(‘Billy’) Albert, was paid recently by ‘Newspaper
News,’ well-known • Sydney specialist journal,
. which devoted its column, ‘Personality of the
Week,’ to an interview with him on the
occasion of the 50th anniversary of his associa-
tion with the newspaper advertising world.”
The N-R.M.A. editor then reached for the
scissors and paste, and the “Newspaper News”
article recorded, among other entertaining
things about the best-known of Sydney’s space-
men, that “W. T. Albert was born at Coolah,
N.S.W., 73 years ago,” started selling adver-
tising space with the “Worker” in 1908, was
next with the “Land,” and then for 30 years
(from 1920) with The Bulletin: “He spent
five years in London and nine in New York
for The Bulletin, and was made a Freeman
of the City of London” —the only Bulletin
man, it can be added, who has had anything
like that happen to him, though one did have
a knighthood fall on him, and if you dig far
enough back you'll find a couple of others
in Darlinghurst jail. Probably Billy (as every-
one knows him) would rather have even that
latter address than live anywhere outside of
Sydney, or at any rate he'd always need the
feel of the pavements under his feet to be
really happy, though to the present writer he
has looked no different grilling fresh-caught
snapper in the coals near Bateman’s Bay or
contemplating pictorial reindeer, “The Stag
at Bay,” in the parlor of an outback pub.
And, of course, if the Yanks, Russians and
others are finally disappointed in their ventures
into space they can blame Bill—in his half-
century in the advertising game he must by
now have sold just about all the space there
ever was to sell.

Herewith Aria’s map-reading of Cecil
Albert Gregory, of “Gregory’s Maps.” A
journalist to begin with, he was “S.M.
Herald” correspondent in the N.S.W.
Central West, iater editor of the “Bathurst
Times,” meanwhile contributing to The
Bulletin and teaching himself Pitman’s
shorthand, reaching the tidy speed of 234
words a minute—at the time acknow-
ledged to be one of the finest shorthand-
writers on the Sydney press.
Moving to Sydney in 1931, Gregory
became news-editor of the old “Daily
Telegraph/’ then joined the N.R.M.A. as
publicity-officer and in the touring depart-
ment. Thence to the map-making, from
appreciating that the bushman could do

maps came out 36 years ago, since when
Gregory’s Road Maps have themselves

color) reached a 23rd edition two or three
months back.
A foundation-member of the A.J.A.,
Gregory recalls as fellow-workers on
Sydney’s Inky Way such good journalists
as Horace Mansell, Ted O’Laughlin,

ABORIGINALITIES
HENRY LAWSON FESTIVAL
TJenry Lawson was born in a tent on
the goldfields at Grenfell (N.S.W.)
on June 17, 1867. The countryside is
still pock-marked with old mine-shafts.
Some of the old buildings still remain.
Cobb and Co.’s stable in Main Street is
now used as a car-park, with a dry-
cleaner’s business occupying part of the
frontage.
The town makes a pretty picture, with
Weddin Mountain rising behind. It is
now the centre of a very rich wool and
wheat area.
In 1924 the people of Grenfell, two
years after Henry Lawson’s death, erected
an obelisk on the spot where he was
born. The area around the site was
dedicated as a park—Lawson Park.
A former headmaster of the Grenfell
school, W. Gelfius, now Director of
Education in Newcastle, founded the
Henry Lawson Association. No other
official recognition was undertaken until
1957, when a new headmaster, Harold
Goodwin, came to the school. He was
from Menindee, out on the Darling.
Goodwin had used Lawson’s cry that
water-conservation should be undertaken
along the Darling when he had led the
campaign in the Far West in 1956 to
have the Menindee Lakes Scheme
recommenced. Lawson had passionately
pleaded for it in his “Song of the
Darling River.” The Far West campaign
was successful. The work was recom-
menced on the Menindee Lakes Project
in 1957.
Coming to Grenfell, Lawson’s birth-
place, Goodwin was surprised that Gren-
fell was not doing something more to
perpetuate the memory of Lawson.
A public meeting was called by
Mayor Sinclair, and a unanimous resolu-
tion was carried that a Henry Lawson
Festival be celebrated on the weekend
closest to Lawson’s birth-date.
It was decided that the festival would
not seek to make a lot of money, but
merely to allow a weekend of suitable
festivity and to cover expenses by making
a slight charge. The profits were to go
towards establishment of a Lawson
Corner in the Grenfell Municipal Library.
The festival, accordingly, is being held
in Grenfell from June 13 to June 16
this year. There is a big programme of
entertainment. And visitors, of course,
will be heartily welcomed.

“Mackville”: The fisherman had
cleaned his catch and two gulls came
racing in for the spoils. There was
plenty for both, but neither was willing
to eat and let eat. With angry squawk-
ings and short, threatening rushes, beaks
open, each prevented the other from
taking more than a quick, futile peck

at the delicacies. In the midst of their
wrangling came a swishing sound, and,
with feet thrust forward like an aqua-
planer, a pelican gracefully skimmed
across the water to fetch-up on the
rock. One savage-looking movement of
the enormous beak was sufficient to
drive both disputants away, leaving the
big bloke to enjoy the repast at his leisure.
Seemed to be a moral in it somewhere.

“C.W.S.”: Here are two more privately
owned railways for “Manamoi’s” collec-
tion (B. 7/5/*5B) —the Emu Bay railway
still runs a good and regular service
down the west coast of Tasmania, and
who hasn’t heard of Wee Georgie Wood,
who daily makes his run from Tulla to
link-up with the Emu Bay line?
“G. 8.”: “Manamoi” (B. 7/5/’5B) could
have won his bet on private railways
without going outside the borders of
N.S.W., which has three such systems:
the South Maitland Railways; the
Adamstown-to-Belmont line (belonging
to the New Redhead Estate and Coal
Company); and the Silverton Tramway
Company’s line. The latter, opened at
Broken Hill in 1888 by the Duke of
Manchester, now carries around 800,000
tons of ore-concentrates annually from
Broken Hill to Cockburn, on its way to
the Port Pirie smelters. Formerly there
was a fourth private railway in N.S.W.,
which formed part of the present Clyde-
Carlingford line from Rosehill, opened
by one Simpson, on April 20, 1896, as a
private passenger-railway. It was said to
be the only one in the State, if not in
Australia. Financial trouble caused it
to be sold to the State for £22,000 in
1900.

“Sackville”: I’ve just read in a pre-war
U.S. publication that the American dia-
mond rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus ) is
the biggest and heaviest venomous snake
in the world. Its “vital statistics” —Bft.
long and 15in. in girth—are impressive,
but I’m not completely convinced. In
those days the Australian taipan had no
press-agent, and a comparison might push
the Yankee reptile back to second place.
Or is it carrying patriotism a bit too far
to claim that we can produce a snake
bigger and more horrible than the rest
of the world’s worst?

steads, and where the horse still reigns
supreme, is about to go!

“Blocker”: The pet kangaroo of an
Ultima (Vic.) storekeeper comes like a
dog when whistled, hops into bed with
the kids, and, when the dinner-gong goes,
settles down to a plate of roast-mutton.
Nobody has told it that it’s supposed to
be herbivorous.

“Myall”: Lucerne (B. 21/5/’5B) was
named after a river-valley in n.-e. Italy,
not after the Swiss city. In the Americas,
East Europe and Asia it is known as
alfalfa (from an Arabic word meaning
“best fodder”). The plant was known to
the Persians as long ago as 490 B.c. and
they carried seeds of it with them when
they invaded Greece. During the first
century a.d. the plant was introduced
into Italy. From there it spread to
Northern Africa, Spain and France dur-
ing the Bth century, and in the 17th
century to England and the New World.
Lucerne was first grown in Australia
about 1806, Governor King reporting
that it “yielded .three cuttings a year.”

“Brick E.”: The bulk of the tiles were
marked “Goodlet and Smith, Granville,”
which dated the structure we were
demolishing as not less than 33 years old
—that firm ceased making tiles around
about 1925. An alien tile here and there
on the roof told of replacements through
damage. There were several “Shannon,
Sydney and Brisbane”; two “Central
Brick Co. St. Peters” (many a year since
that firm made tiles); three or four
“Wunderlich” (still making ’em); and a
couple that really intrigued me. They
read: “Pierre Sacon. St. Henry, Mar-
seilles.” The inscription was more
finely cut than the lettering on the
local tiles, and it was surrounded by a
delicate tracery terminating in a per-
fectly imprinted five-pointed star. The
French, of course, invented that type of
tile ; the most commonly used today, it
is still specified as the Marseilles pattern ;
and I am wondering whether Pierre was
the inventor. If so, he had justification
for some pride. Progress has developed
colored, glazed, moss-free and water-
proof tiles, but not by the smallest detail
has anybody been able to improve on the
pattern of those old French tiles.
Would, you kindly remove your hat? The chief is very pernickety
about his meals.”
“8.J.L.”: Those brickies who couldn’t
afford an unpaid holiday on Anzac Day
(B. 21/5/’sB| should be in the A.W.U.,
canecutting. Despite the fact that cut-
ters are on piecework, the award stipu-
lates that holidays must be paid for,
not at the daily-wage rate (which is
about 665.), but at the average rate of
earnings at the time of the holiday. As
many cutters earn up to £8 per day and
over, it’s not bad pay for a day in the
barracks.

“Stromlo”: Is Taronga Park or any
other Australian zoo going to be repre-
sented at the international congress of
zoologists and zoo-directors in Frankfurt
next August? If so, it is to be hoped
the Australians will inspect, during the
Frankfurt zoo’s centenary celebrations,
the magnificent “exotarium,” a mixture
of polar wastes and tropical jungles.
Tropical-fish tanks and polar icebergs lie
behind enormous glass windows which
allow visitors uninhibited views of fish
and animals enjoying these replicas of
their natural habitats. Penguins, turtles
and reptiles disport in sea-waters, and
alligators, monkeys and brilliant birds
share vine-hung tropical passages. An
enormous technical apparatus is needed
to provide the right temperatures for the
various exhibits and the constant flow of
water, fresh and salt. There is even a
daily jungle thunderstorm.
•'* * *
“Salmon Gums”: An old cement bath
had been lying upside-down for years,
with the rim forced well into the grass-
roots all around it and with the plug
almost blocked ; yet when 1 upended it
there were three red-back spiders, all
thriving, and dozens of old egg-sacs.
Skipping the problem of how they got
there, what did they live on, and how did
they survive in that oven? In other red-
back nests nearby I found the remains of
beetles and earwigs and even lizards, but
there were none of these inside the bath.
There’s a terrific amount of life in the top
few inches of even dry soil, and the sand
around my place would assay an ant-nest
to the square foot; presumably the
spiders could have lived on ants and other
soil-dwelling things. And they must have
lived well, because the egg-sacs
suggested matings, and hungry red-
back females don’t mate easily. So we’ll
say they ate well and their victims’ body-
juices supplied their liquid needs. There’S
still the heat. I’d put the range of
temperatures under that bath at from
somewhere below freezing on a frosty
morning to around 200° F. at noon in
mid-summer. How many animals can
tolerate that range?
* * * «
“Nimrod”: Tell “Kelms” there’s
another outsize blackboy (B. 9/4/’5B) at
Deepdene, near the Leeuwin (W.A.),
which stands at a little more than 30ft.
He’s a bit out, though, in the rate of
growth. The Deepdene tree has grown
sft. in the last 10 years. At a similar
rate the Albany tree would be 50 years
old, not 2500.


“Bellfield”: Consider the number of
ways an Aussie can be dismissed from
his job. Among the more printable he
can be sacked, fired, hoisted, speared,
tramped, turfed-out, hunted, shown the
door, given the bullet or just plain
scrubbed. Should he decide to beat the
boss to the punch he may snatch it, pull-
out, toss it in, dice it, sky it, drag it, wipe
it, or give it away. To achieve that end
he may demand that the said boss give
him his time, scratch him off, or do
various things with the job. His reasons
for leaving, as related later to his mates,
are sometimes attributed to nothing more
than itchy feet or having “had it” ; on
the other hand, the job may have been a
cow, or illegitimate. But for a brief period
he wouldn’t be worrying, anyway. If he
“Watch out for those goggle-eyed brutes, Sharko — they're DANGEROUS!”
is a youngish man, his pockets are lined
with coin, oof, dough, sugar or hay. If
he is getting on in years his pockets will
hold jingle, brass, jink, Oscar, kale or
spondulicks. The worrying starts when he
is flat, skinned, motherless, stony hearts-
of-oak, or has “gone bad.”

“Mackville”: What looked like -two
baby snakes were hanging from the
young kookaburra’s beak and obviously
causing him considerable trouble.
Repeatedly he flogged the dangling ends
resoundingly against the solid branch
beneath his feet, gulped, failed to achieve
any noticeable gain, and flogged again.
At closer range 1 saw that the “snakes”
were the long legs of what must have
been a fully-grown green frog. As I
watched, the bird gave an extra-solid
whack followed by a mighty swallow,
and the danglings were gone. Not a
bad feat, considering the size of a green
frog in relation to a kooka’s gullet. No
wonder he skipped the customary
triumphant peal of satisfaction and sat
motionless until darkness hid him.
• * * *
“Santo”: The jungle-fowls of the
Pacific Islands closely resemble ou r
domestic species in appearance and habit
except for one thing the hens don t
cackle, though the roosters are vocal
strongly at dawn. Why this unusual femi-
nine silence? Is it that a multiplicity of
natural enemies has caused the wily hen
to suppress her age-old instinct to
announce that she has successfully per-
formed her morning duty?

Unk White’s drawing of the road to
Dirrinbandi (B. 21/5/’5B) seems to
have missed-out on the greenery which
lined the part of it that I was on last
month.
There was little dust, and tyres purred
along dirt-roads well settled by recent
rains ; Mitchell and Never-fail still car-
ried good feed ; and any crow, far from
scanning the horizon for carrion (like
the one depicted by Unk), would have
been on the ground with his cobbers
belting into grasshoppers.
Young leopard-wood trees stood fresh
and green ; ironwood, whitewood, budda
and wilga all looked in good trim ; and
the bimble-box flashed its mirrors in
the sun. Sleek, late-model sedans nosed-
in to the tennis-courts, where the lasses
were as well turned-out as any you’d see
along the coast and just at nimble at their
game—though the advent of Unk’s vehi-
cular monstrosity might have interrupted
play for a while.
I can understand the feelings of its
driver, however —the stony rises cost me
a windscreen, too, and 400 miles rolled
by before I found another. Still, if Unk’s
veteran continued through Dirrinbandi to
the border there would be scenic com-
pensations, for the noblest Glasshouse
Mountain in Queensland is not just north
of Brisbane but at Hebei, away out on
the plains. But then Cook never saw the
stack of empty bottles beside the Hebei
pub.
BILLY T.
THE BRUMBIES
With a rattling noise of stockwhips
And a thunder of shouting men
They’re bringing the shy wild horses
Out of the hills again.
They’re clattering down the gullies
And with only a knee for guide
The beat of the station horses
Are matching them stride for stride.
They’re dodging them round the boulders
Where the wallabies leap for fear
And the blue-tongues slither for shelter
Knowing that Death came near
From the flint-hard hooves of the stallion,
His nostrils flecked with foam,
As he hustles his crazed companions
Out from the hills of home.
Out from the hills that have held them,
High where the stars were kind,
Where the eagles nest and the eclwes
Ring to the hills behind —
When the leader streaks for the timber,
Ridging the far plain’s rim
And the dim, dank caverns of shelter
Known to the herd and him.
Shouting and swearing and cursing,
Blind from the dust and the sun,
Fearing one moment they'd lost him,
Thinking one moment they’d won,
Riding like demons to wheel him,
The musterers, mad with the chase,
Find the dull gloom of the gidgee
Rearing.green walls in their face.
And though they may challenge the
timber,
Stout and unyielding as iron,
Only the maddest amongst them
Would tackle the lawyer-vine —
With its lash like the pain of a whip-crack
ft dazzles the keenest of sight
Whilst the brumbies, sure-footed and
silent,
Vanish like shades in the night.
Vanish! He’ll know they are beaten!
The musterers give it away,
Half-glad and half-sad that so gallant
A foe man has carried the day!
Till, hearing a shrill neigh of triumph
Float mockingly over the plain,
They vow that the morrow will find them
Hunting the brumby again.

Business, Robbery, Etc.
Fortune and Misfortune
/Chairman L. B. Robinson, of
the ever-growing Consoli-
dated Zinc empire, has a story
full of variety—fortune and
misfortune —to tell share-
holders in London on June 24.
The Zinc Corp. mine at
Broken Hill and share-interests
in New Broken Hill Consoli-
dated have both been hit hard
by the drop in lead-zinc prices,
and Mr. Robinson considers
that a combined lead-zinc price
of £175 (stg.) in the U.K
would be a fair one for both
producer and consumer.
(Present prices are £7l a ton
for lead and £6l 10s. for zinc.)
Better profits were earned
from acid and superphosphate
production by Sulphide Corp.
(Cockle Creek, N.S.W.), and
“satisfactory” .profits were
earned by Titanium and
Zirconium Industries, Ltd.,
from treatment of beach-sands
on Stradbroke Island (Q.).
Good profits are expected this
year also from beach-mining,
but the long-term outlook for
rutile in the world’s markets is
obscure.
Profits from the operations
of Imperial Smelting Corp. in
the U.K. were rather less than
in 1956
But as a result of decreased
N. S. Wales mining royalties
and taxation payable generally,
consolidated net profit was only
£274,397 lower at £1,769,986
(sterling).
In February this year opera-
tions throughout the Broken
Hill field were closed-down one
day in 10. In addition, Zinc
Corp. and New B. H. Consol,
have transferred a large group
of men from ore-extraction to
development, tending to send
development far ahead of the
mill, but reserving ore for
more profitable times whilst
keeping a skilled work-force
intact.
Progress is going on with the
design and planning of the
smelter at Cockle Creek
(N.5.W.)., where acid-
producing capacity is also being
extended.
Commonwealth Aluminium
Corporation, in which the
British Aluminium Company
will be associated with Con-
solidated Zinc, is proceeding
with its exploration and
development of the bauxite
deposits at Weipa, on Cape
York Peninsula. An 84-year
agreement for development of
the field, with the right of
extension for a further 21
years, has been negotiated
with the Queensland Govern-
ment.
Under the agreement an
alumina plant must be estab-
lished in Queensland “as soon
as practicable.” Over 160
square-miles of the Weipa area
have already been shown to
bear bauxite “of commercial
interest.”
Investigation of potential
power - supplies, possible
harbors, etc., is now going on,
and a five-year option has been
acquired over the Blair Athol
coalfield. Sources of coal-
supplies will ultimately have a
bearing on the site of the
alumina plant.
Bauxite deposits at Gove, on
the Gulf of Carpentaria (N.T.),
have been consolidated with
the other interests of. Common-
wealth Aluminium Corp.
The Commonwealth Govern-
ment and British Aluminium
Company have been investigat-
ing, through New Guinea
Resources Prospecting Co., the
hydroelectric potential of N.G.
rivers. (Earlier this year the
Commonwealth accepted in
principle Con. Zinc’s offer to
buy its 51 p.c. interest in the
N.G. Resources co.)
Water - power resources,
particularly in the Purari River
region, have since been in-
spected by Con. Zinc, and
investigations will now be
carried “to a more conclusive
stage.” Hydro-power is essenti-
ally related to the matter of
producing aluminium metal, the
ultimate objective of Common-
wealth Aluminium. But if a
market for alumina “can be
developed at an intermediate
stage, it will hasten the estab-
lishment of a new industry in
Queensland.”
Mr. Robinson’s concluding
remarks on the aluminium
venture are important:
The past year has seen some
notable progress towards our
objective, but I would emphasise
again this year that we do not
underestimate either the magnitude
of the task or the time required
to bring our plans to fruition. In
common with other non-ferrous
metals, aluminium is at present
experiencing a phase of over-
supply throughout the world. How-
ever, this new project is essentially
a long-term one. and we have no
doubt that the Weipa deposits will
be the foundation of an industrial
development that will in due
course bring great benefit to the
Australian economy and assume
an important role in the world’s
aluminium industry,
Commenting on base-metal
prices, chairman Robinson says
that the main brunt of a
reversal of the world infla-
tionary movement has fallen
on international commodities.
Changes in the U.S. stockpiling
policy and liquidation of
British stocks held by the
Board of Trade have had their
influence in a drop of 40 p.c.
in lead and zinc prices since
May of last year.
Recovery in prices is made
doubtful by Government policy
in regard to stocks and the
U.S. proposal to subsidise its
own producers.
M.L.C. H.-p. Alliance
A new twist was given to the
hire - purchase alliance
development when it was
announced on June 2 that the
big Mutual Life and Citizens’
Assurance had agreed to take
four-million ss. shares at par
in Alliance Holdings, Ltd., and
thereby acquire a 44.4 p.c.
interest in that terms-finance
enterprise.
This is the first time an Aus-
tralian life-office has acquired
such a predominating interest
in a hire-purchase concern. As
h.-p. activities do not otherwise
marry with life-assurance, it
can be assumed that the deal,
from the M.L.C.’s point of
view, is mainly one of making
a good investment. From the
Alliance viewpoint the associa-
tion should add to its strength
and stability, with some
advantages in respect of
office-work and geographical
representation.
Alliance Holdings, Ltd.,
represents a merger of Alliance
Acceptance Co., Ltd., and
Portadown Discounts, Ltd., in
1956.
Alliance Acceptance was one
of the first flotations sponsored
by the ill-fated Mainguard
(Aust.) venture (in 1950), but
it has come a fair way since
then, and the ss. shares of the
new holding-co. had a lowest
market price of ss. 6d. in 1957
and a highest of Bs. Id. Earlier
this year they were selling at
around Bs. Following the
announcement of the M.L.C.
move they have risen to 9s.
Two former directors of
Alliance have retired —G. J.
Cullen and K. R. Winn. The
new board will be: G. A.
(“Peter”) Lloyd (chairman), A.
Jeffers, J. H. Partridge (manag-
ing-director), M. C. Alder,
M. H. Allen, J. H. Clack, J. F.
Nancarrow and A. W. Spooner.
If the current earning-power
and div.-paying capacity of
Alliance is maintained the
M.L.C. will receive a 15 p.c.
(tax-free) return on its invest-
ment in Alliance, which com-
pares with an average net
return of £4 11s. 4d. per cent,
last year from the funds
invested in the Ordinary
Department.
M. and B. and Brambles
W. E. Bramble and Sons
(Transport), Ltd., offer
to take-over Morison and
Bearby, Ltd. (both cos. of
Newcastle), on the basis of
eight Bramble ss. shares for
each five £1 shares in Morison
and Bearby, and M. and B.
shares rise from ground an
average price of 225. to about
295. (Bramble shares being
then around 195.)
Some bigger shareholders in
M. and B. declare that the pro-
posed basis of takeover is
unfair to M. and B. and refuse
to come in, and advise other
shareholders to stay out. M.
and B. shares fall to 255. W. E.
Bramble shares drop to 18s.
Then M. and B. directors
announce that, because of short-
age of working-capital, M. and
B. will pay no interim div.,
though 10 p.c. p.a. had been
paid half-yearly during*the pre-
ceding three years. M. and B.
shares fall to 245.
It is pointed-out in the press
that the passing of the interim
is at variance with forecasts by
the M. and B. board last year.
Directors remind share-
holders in M. and B. that the
date of acceptance of the
merger proposal is June 9.
(“No d i v.” announcement
made on June 4.) They stress
the advantages of a merger,
especially future prospects.
A group of shareholders in
M. and B. requisition a meet-
ing in order to defer the take-
over bid by Brambles.
The same group then ask
for an extension of time to
consider the takeover offer in
order for it to be discussed at
a general meeting.
On June 6 W. E. Bramble
and Sons (Transport), Ltd.,
advise the board of Morison
and Bearby that it had extended
the date for acceptance of its
takeover offer to June 26.
Shareholders in M. and B.
would therefore be able to
consider and discuss the terms
of Bramble’s offer at the
special meeting called for June
23. . .
They seem to be entitled to
a full discussion of the posi-
tion, and are natural in their
resentment of any suggestion
of being hustled into a sudden
decision.
On the basis of sharemarket
prices, the Bramble's offer is


COMPANY MEETING
NEW BROKEN HILL CONSOLIDATED LIMITED
PROFIT UP DESPITE LOWER METAL PRICES
The Twenty-second Annual Meeting of New
Broken Hill Consolidated Limited’ will be held
on 24th June at 37 Dover Street, London.
The following are extracts
front the circulated statement
by the Chairman, Mr. L. B.
Robinson:
FINANCIAL RESULTS
In 1937 the output of ore
and the lead grade in ore
produced were both appreci-
ably higher than in 193 b. A
reduct.on in the average cost
per ton of ore of approximately
18%, compared with the pre-
vious year, was achieved, and
the tonnage of lead realised in
1957 was 37,617 tons, compared
with 44,044 tons in 1956.
Despite these achievements
the mine trading balance for
the year amounting to
£1,904,035, showed a oecrease
of £418,369, compared with
1956, due to the severe fall
in the prices of lead and zinc
during the last eight months
of the year. The profit before
taxation amounted to
£1,591,313, compared with
£1,991,129 for 1956.
The company has obtained
recognition as an Overseas
Trade Corporation as from
6th April, 1957, and derives a
substantial benefit from the
reduction in United Kingdom
taxation. The provision for
Australian and United King-
dom taxation on the profits for
the year amounts to £534,217,
compared with £1,116,600 for
1956.
The result is a net profit for
the year of £1,057,096, an
increase of £182,567 on the
figure for 1956.
The change of status to that
of an overseas Trade Corpora-
tion as from 6th April, 1957,
has also released provisions
made in previous years for
U.K. taxation amounting to
£750,000. This amount includes
the whole of the provision for
U.K. Income Tax for 1957/58
and deferred taxation in
respect of initial allowances
shown in the balance-sheet as
at 31st December, 1956.
The amount available for
distribution including the
above provision for taxation
no longer required and the
balance of £339,635 brought
forward from 1956, is
£2,146,731. As indicated in the
announcement for the interim
dividend, the directors are
recommending a final dividend
of 3/- per share, making a
total distribution of 5/- per
share for the year, which is
the same as for 1956. The
total required for the interim
and final dividends is £693,059.
The directors have given
very careful consideration to
the disposal of the large
balance available for appro-
priation. The prices of lead
and zinc have remained at very
low levels through 1958 to
date, and the outlook shows
little promise of an early
improvement. Further, it has
been necessary not only to
budget for a reduced produc-
tion of ore at which it will be
difficult to maintain last year’s
level of cost, but also to
transfer part of the labour
force to additional develop-
ment work entailing the use
of further capital funds.
These factors will all mean a
considerable drain during
1958 on the company’s cash
balances and the directors
consider that it is essential to
conserve resources to the
utmost. Accordingly, the
directors have not felt able to
recommend a larger total dis-
tribution than 5/- per share
for the year and have trans-
ferred £750,000 to general
reserve and £350,000 to a mine
amortisation reserve.
These appropriations of
profit leave a surplus of
£353,672 to be carried forward,
an increase of £14,037.
PRODUCTION
In the prevailing conditions
of world markets in which, in
common with many other com-
modities, a surplus of lead and
zinc has developed, this Com-
pany in conjunction with the
Zinc Corporation has bud-
geted for a reduced produc-
tion of ore and recoverable
metals during the current
year. At the same time, it has
been, and remains, our earnest
desire and policy to keep intact
the excellent organisation of
staff and employees built up
over the past years, and accord-
ingly, since the commencement
of operations in 1958, a large
group of men has been trans-
ferred from ore extraction to
development work. Our
development programme in
recent years has provided
ample working places for pro-
Auction requirements, and this
transfer will therefore mean
the undertaking of develop-
ment far in advance of that
necessary for the normai
operation of the mine. In
addition, in February of this
year arrangements were con-
cluded witn the Unions for a
suspension of operations
throughout the Broken Hill
field on one day per fortnight,
equivalent to a reduction of
10% in wonting time. It will,
of course, be our policy to
revert to full and normal
operating conditions just as
soon as the outlook appears
more favourable.
LEAD AND ZINC
MARKETS
As regards the markets for
lead ana zinc, 1 would repeat
as on former occasions the
statement I am making to
members of The Consolidated
Zinc Corporation Limited.
Since I last reviewed the
lead / zinc situation there
have been important
changes in the world econo-
mic scene, and the main
brunt of a reversal of the
inflationary movement has
fallen on international com-
modities. Last year I also
referred to the problems
that would emerge with a
change in U.S. stockpiling
policy. This change came
about all too soon there-
after, with the added threat
-now embodied in recom-
mendations from the U.S.
Tariff Commission of in-
creased duties or even
quotas on imports into that
market. Additionally the
situation has become still
more confused by the pub-
lication of the U.S. Govern-
ment’s own plan to sub-
sidise domestic production
at guaranteed price levels
for fixed tonnages.
During the same twelve-
month period we have also
suffered from a continuing
liquidation of stocks in the
United Kingdom held by
the Board of Trade,
although I am pleased to say
that, temporarily at least,
sales of zinc from that
source have been suspended.
All these factors have
had a severe effect on prices
and since May of last year
lead and zinc have suffered
a loss on the London Metal
Exchange of approximately
40%. Unfortunately the
prospects for improvement
in the present position of
over-supply of these metals
are further obscured by the
uncertainties of the general
condition of trade through-
out the world, and in par-
ticular by the steps being
taken, or proposed in
various countries, notably
the U.S.A., for the pro-
tection and even expan-
sion of domestic production.
In these circumstances it is
difficult, if not impossible,
to forecast an early improve-
ment in prices, but it is, I
believe, quite clear that a
higher level will be essen-
tial to sustain the produc-
tion of these metals neces-
sary to meet the continued
progress towards a higher
standard of living through-
out the world.
Shareholders will remem-
ber that on previous occa-
sions we have suggested
that a combined lead-zinc
price in the United King-
dom of around £175 would
prove satisfactory for both
producers and consumers.
This figure is, I would
emphasise, some way below
the level which the U.S.
Government during its
stockpiling programme con-
sidered not only reasonable
but worthy of support, and
I still believe that a com-
bined price of £175 will in
the long run be required
to meet the needs of world
markets.
CONCLUSION
The immediate outlook is
of necessity overshadowed by
the statistical position of base
metals and in common with
other producers our earnings
are bound to reflect the cur-
rent level of prices for lead and
zinc. However, thanks to the
management, staff and em-
ployees whose continued record
of improvement in efficiencies
and cost once more deserves
the highest praise and con-
gratulations, our competitive
position is strong and I feel
confident that we will hold
our position until such time
as prices for our metals attain
more remunerative levels.

Tariff Anomaly
fFrom a. j. k. birch, secretary
of the chamber of
Commerce]
'T'his Chamber wishes to
support the case quoted (B.
7/6/’5B) in regard to duty on
59in. rayon voile as a typical
example of the injustices that
occur when an increased rate
of duty is brought in overnight
without regard to either, goods
on firm order or even those
actually on the water at the
time of the imposition of the
duty.
In America it is the practice
to allow a period of grace
before the duty becomes
payable on goods already on
firm order, and the Australian
Customs Department could
well consider some similar
approach in the interests of
equity.
If the department were
even prepared to exempt goods
in transit at the time of the
imposition of the duty it would
be a much more equitable
approach, and would avoid
unfair discrimination within
Australia amongst importers
who either are or are not liable
for the duty, depending on the
port at which the goods are
landed.

Oistrakh in Melbourne
So much of Melbourne tried
to get into the Town Hall to
hear the Russian violinist that
dozens had to be accommo-
dated within arm’s length of
his elbow. This didn’t seem
to discommode the violinist in
the slightest. His peculiarly
relaxed obsession for the music
he brought to life with his
fiddle showed clearly that he
cared less than tuppence for
any inconvenience that might
be brought upon him ; a herd
of elephants could breathe
down his neck without perturb-
ing him. The same could be
said for his accompanist
Yampolski.
Oistrakh’s approach to 1 his
music seemed to be solely an
attempt to get as close as pos-
sible to the composer’s original
intention, and what he meant
in truth and beauty. Interpre-
tation in the looser sense, flights
and fancies of the imagination,
the subtleties and delights of
sheer technical proficiency
played little part in the musical
solutions proferred. His pro-
gramme was well chosen. * It
ranged through the simple,
delightful moods of a Leclair
sonata to the passionate
nostalgia of the Cesar Franck
sonata; then, following the
interval, works by his country-
men Prokofieff and Tschai-
kowsky.
The Prokofieff sonata could
be called the most modern
work of the recital, though its
line and style belong to the
past. Oistrakh brought to it
an almost Mozartian elegance
and finesse. Yampolski’s
accompaniments were emphatic
or subservient according to the
requirements of the music.
Oistrakh obliged his clamor-
ing audience with three exqui-
site encores —a Brahms adagio,
an interesting something
arranged by Kriesler, and
Debussy’s “Clair de Lune,”
which, in its evocative clarity
and exact sentiment, was pos-
sibly the climax of the night’s
proceedings.
At another concert the Slav
virtuoso let himself go more
than in the first one. A
restrained performance of the
Hindemith Sonata, Opus 11,
No. I, was\the highlight of the
evening. There have been
mutterings about the lack of
tone in some of his Town Hall
pieces compared with the re-
markable lusciousness of his
recorded music.
Present commentator hasn’t
listened to any of the record-
ings, so he is not in a position
to have an opinion, but he has
had a vast experience of the
acoustics of the Melbourne
Town Hall and has noted how
a guaranteed virtuoso has
seemed great on a warm night
when the house is half-full of
people, but small on a wet and
cold night when the same hall
is packed with furs, overcoats
and mufflers.
The only reasonable test that
could be applied would be for
Mr. Oistrakh to walk on to the
platform with his fiddle and
a gramophone and play one
instrument against the other.

“The Heart” Shifts
On its last beat at the
Comedy, Melbourne, “The
Shifting Heart” shifts shortly
to the country. It will be the
first play the Elizabethan Trust
will have taken on tour in Vic-
toria, and its present company
and its author will go with it.
It is also probably the first
controversial Australian play
to penetrate the rural districts.
It will submit itself to inspec-
tion in London next spring
with Sir Laurence Olivier
attending to its production.
Unlike “The Doll,” it won’t
have its original cast. If Sir
Laurence finds one as good he
will be lucky.
♦♦♦ ♦> ❖
New Sydney Shows
New Sydney shows due for
review here include Oistrakh's
Sydney programmes; a quite
brilliant performance of Dylan
Thomas’s “Under Milk Wood”
by the Independent Theatre at
North Sydney ; and a forceful
production of John Osborne’s
“angry young man” play,
“Look Back in Anger,” now at
the Elizabethan Theatre.
Ballet Is Ballet
It cannot be emphasised too
firmly or too uncompromis-
ingly that ballet is ballet:
dancing, music, decor, sym-
bolism, story,* making a total
effect of enchantment. Drop
any one element and you
inevitably reduce the enchhnt
ment.
So when the New York
Ballet modernises “L’Apres-
midi d’un faune” and cuts out
all the woodland poetry, what
can you get but “L’Apres-midi
d’un faune” with all the poetry
cut out? When they dance,
with many ingenious postures,
“The Four Temperaments”
with hardly any story and in
the black tights in which you
can see them rehearsing back-
stage any day of the week,
what can you get but, essenti-
ally, a backstage rehearsal?
When they dance gay march-
ing-dances to march-music, in
bright military costumes but
without any story, once again
you get only half a ballet.
It must be admitted that in
the military affair the quick-
ness of the legs deceived the
eye: it was extremely lively
and colorful. The whole pro-
gramme is brilliantly danced ;
and there was also “Swan
Lake.” But it does seem on the
whole that, seeking for variety
and modernity, this company
is robbing itself too much of
color and story and, in the
music, trying to atone for this
deficiency by too much noise.
D. S.
Choral Festival
Occasion: a choral festival
of music organised by the
Royal School of Church Music.
The scene: St. Andrew’s
Cathedral, Sydney, the
Cathedral choir filling their
stalls, and a procession of
diocesan choirs, fully robed,
filing into the centre of the
church—a forest of white
surplices with row on row of
black-mortarboarded female
singers.
The service was ordinary
Evensong plus three anthems.
From a raised dais midway
.between the choir-stalls Mervyn
Byers, cathedral organist,
presided like a cassocked genie
—to say he conducted would
be an understatement; he
cajoled, punched, manually
entreated. . . The effect was
amazing: a couple of hundred
robed singers uniting in two
psalms, bringing speech-rythmn
to graceful reality.
First of the three anthems
was Farrant’s unaccompanied
“Hide Not Thou Thy Face,”
done with studied regard to the
delicate interweaving parts, not-
withstanding a shortage of
alto sound. Next, Morley’s
“Through The Day Thy Love
Has Spared Us,” fragile as
. Dresden china, a gentle melody
shared between upper and
lower parts. Rather nicely sung,
if at one stage the anonymous
organist set a fractionally slow
tempo.
Third and last was Prit-
chard’s vigorous contemporary
setting of “Oh Praise God in
His Holiness.” This was the
least assured of his trio, and
the organist missed a fine
opportunity at the words
“Praise Him in the sound of
the trumpet.” Here, there’s a
sudden keychange and a bar
of ascending octaves —a hint,
surely, for a blast from the solo
tuba or great organ trumpet.

Aida
Verdi in evening-dress is
better than no Verai at all, so
a Brisbane concert version of
“Aida” was acceptable because
it revived music by the most
neglected of great composers
hereabouts. The trouble With
these concert performances is
that they turn opera into ora-
torio, and are solemn when
they should tingle with drama
Soloists and choir give the
impression of having seen little
of other before the night,
and a nodding acquaintance of
this sort is a long way from
the real discipline of opera.
Conductor Rudolf Pekarek
had a well-trained choir which
was unbalanced by an excess
of sopranos, unless Verdi
intended to give the impression
that the ancient Egyptians were
largely female. Pekarek con-
trived to bring something of
the theatre into the perform-
ance in the Triumph Scene, and
also when Alan Light and Neil
Easton held the stage. These
two are seasoned, opera men,
and when they sang, action was
not hard to visualise.
Heather McMillan sang
Aida, and, if not always in
character, she used her big
voice well in the two main solos
and in the soaring ensembles.

FROM LEADING STOCK & STATION AGENTS
Tenor Donald Smith also had
a big voice which rang out in
ensembles, but needed much
more rehearsal to weld him
vocally and temperamentally
into the part of Rhadames.
The gamest singer of them
all was Barbara Ridgway, who
Whs unkindly cast in the heavy-
weight role of Amneris. The
necessary combination of jea-
lousy and love makes this the
subtlest part in the whole
opera, and Miss Ridgway’s
voice was much too light and
could only struggle against very
heavy odds.
The adaptation of the opera
for the concert platform was
the work of Sir Malcolm
Sargent. It went well until the
Nile Scene duet between Aida
and her father, one of Verdi’s
best moments. Here, for some
reason, all the superb lyrical
moments were butchered, leav-
ing only enough of the music
to keep the thread of the action
unbroken.* Any full-blooded
Aida might have taken the
handiest Egyptian spear to an
arranger who robbed her of a
wonderful scene. In future it
might be better to let the
singers make the arrangement.
They migfit be more sensitive
in their selection and rejection.

End of a Journey
U’rOlu London]
For the second time in its
history the Old Vic has per-
formed all Shakspeare’s plays.
There are two reasons why this
task is unenviable. The first, a
practical one, is a matter of
resources, for the public, whose
financial support is needed to
the extent of four-fifths of the
Vic’s income, tends to be
choosy. And the second, a
much wider one} is that several
of the plays (especially some
of the earlier comedies) are
best forgotten, except by
scholars; they have no place
in the public theatre of today.
At the risk of sounding a
philistine, one can only record
the truth —that an evening of
inferior Shakspeare (inferior
Bankside, perhaps, would be
apter) titivated by producers’
tricks, can be at once an ordeal
and an embarrassment. So it is
with thankfulness that many of
us look forward to the new
season in the autumn, when the
Vic will return to its former
policy of interspersing the
Shakspearian repertory with
works by other dramatists.
The last play of the cycle,
“Henry VIII,” is reinforced by
distinguished outsiders, them-
selves former Old Vic players.
That the star element is not, in
the old-fashioned sense, trans-
cendent is a compliment to the
excellence of the present com-
pany. The play is a chronicle,
and an uneven one, so that
questions of unity and propor-
tion are hardly relevant. But
such comparative youngsters as
Paul Daneman, Jill Dixon and
Derek Godfrey are quite un-
abashed and never over-
shadowed by the presence of
their elders, Edith Evans, John
Gielgud and Harry .Andrews —
and this despite the exceptional
generosity accorded by the
producer to his guests. There’s
a real old-world touch about
those upstage exits, those full-
face speeches and that Oh-so-
Irvingesque drooping of the
left shoulder.
Not that these, performances
are other than excellent. In
particular, Gielgud’s Wolsey is
finely wrought with all the
economy of true class, convey-
ing pride, slyness, high-living
and inscrutability. Andrew's
Henry is virile and sparkling
but rather lacking in bluffness
and power of command. Miss
Evans’s Katharine is dignified,
eloquent and most touching,
although historically not very
credible —it is hard to believe
that this austere English
dowager, complete with poker-
face and stiff upper-lip, had
ever been nearer Spain than
St. James’s, Spanish Place.

The Victorian Symphony
Orchestra is contemplating an
invitation from the Japanese
Government to visit and play
to the music-lovers of Nippon
this year, the first Governmen-
tal invitation to be received by
an Australian orchestra. It
will need £30,000 for the air-

touring and playing 45 concerts
will be paid by Nippon, which
has 10-million listeners on the

the £30,000.
Artbursts
Weaver Hawkins
Weaver Hawkins’s circling
designs of boxers and foot-
ballers in his large exhibition
at David Jones’, Sydney, might
make a useful basis for sculp-
ture but are too thin and flat
td appeal as paintings. In
general, partly because the
viewer is not bothered by his
haadequacies of drawing and
texture, partly because the
artist has felt more free to
make his own choice of pattern
and color, the closer he comes
to abstraction the more effec-
tive he is; and such pieces
as “Abstract A 2,” with its inter-
lacing fishlike forms in blue
and orange, have a light charm.
He would probably do much
better, however, in a totally
different style, for in one paint-
ing, “A Picnic,” some depth
of feeling, as well as some
weight of paint, makes itself
manifest.

Current Fashions
The Australian Galleries in
Melbourne are holding a
monster show of modern giants
which, to eyes unfamiliar with
current fashions,.must,be rather
terrifying. To be in the fashion
these days, painting has to be"
distorted, and, with few excep-
tions, almost everything in this
exhibition is distorted, John
Blackman probably going
furthest in that direction. His
girl in “The Yellow Flower,”
whose glassy eye glares bale-
fully out from a mass of dead
flesh, is at first sight most
alarming, but the effect wears
off after prolonged contempla-
tion.
Running one’s eye along the
west wall one's attention is
arrested by John Perceval’s
violence, expressed in “River
Overgrowth” and “The Jump-
ing Mullet.” There is, how-
ever, something rather alluring
in Mr. Perceval’s tortured tree-
trunks, tangled water and
jumping fish, and the effect
would probably be lost if they
were painted better.
John Brack has more of his
cartoon-work, but, in addition,
exhibits a portrait of Thomas
Purves, the gallery’s director.
Without the interest of his
usual subject-matter it looks
rather academic. There is a
feeling for light and shade in
J. Carington Smith’s “Easter
Moon” and “Grey Morning,”
and a feeling for human beings
in Noel Counihan’s “Poli-
ticians.” Mary Talbot’s
decorative panels of diaphanous
damsels bedecked with flowers
have imagination.

purple ranges have been selling
like hotdogs at a football final
—and at prices that would
make any white artist’s mouth
water. There is also a brisk
business in framed reproduc-
tions.
At the same time a show of
pictures with exactly the same
subject-matter and much the
same aesthetic content has been
attracting scarcely any interest
at the Tasmanian Tourist
Bureau's gallery in Collins
Street. The author of these is
Volodymyr Sawchak, a com-
paratively new New Australian
who has just returned from
spending several months in the
Arunta country.
The pictures of both the abo.
artists and the New Australian
reflect the conventions of the
schools where they received
their training. In the case of
the New Australian it was some
European academy and in the
case of the abos. it was the
National Gallery in Mel-
bourne per medium of Rex
Battarbee, their instructor.
This explains the mystery of
their resemblance to one
another better than any
supposed resemblance to tip

“The High Cost of Loving”
This bright and well-paced
comedy deals with the trials
and tribulations of an up-and-
coming company - executive
who, by an oversight, is not
invited to an important
luncheon given by ttye top-brass
of the giant corporation which
is about to absorb the com-
pany. This apparent knock-
back coincides with his cele-
brations with his colleagues
following his wife’s announce-
ment that a happy event is
coming, and the flaps he gets
into, both domestic and com-
mercial, add-up to good fun.
As well as directing the film,
Jose Ferrer carries the main
acting burden with cleverly-
timed comedy which is never
exaggerated, and the support-
ing cast gives him solid
assistance.

“So Long As You’re Near
Me”
This German-made film, with
German actors and dubbed-in
English voices (very well done,
too), concerns a “bit”-part
actress who is slightly burned
in a film-studio fire and taken
home by the director to her
slum dwelling. Unable to
reconcile her refinement with
her surroundings, he investi-
gates and uncovers the story of
war-time sufferings with her
young husband ; he decides to
make a film of this story, with
her as star. Her rise in pro-
fessional status brings domestic
frictions, and things develop
into a contest between director
and husband for the lady's
affections.
Maria Schell, one of Europe’s
most gifted actresses, brings
sensitiveness to the role of the
young wife, and G. W. Fischer,
as the hard-driving, perfec-
tionist director, makes a most
impressive first appearance.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Email, Ltd.
Tn strong demand as a growth-stock a
■*- year or two ago, Email scrip has more
recently given indications of shrinking
rather than gaining in investment stature
when evaluated solely on the basis of
balance-sheet movements and earnings.
Although the accompanying decline in
sharemarket support may have sprung,
really, from frustrated hopes of quick gains
in income or capital, Email has, in fact,
handed-out two generous helpings of
bonus-scrip over the past three years
(making last term’s 8 p.c. div. worth 20
p.c. on pre-bonus holdings), and most
sharemarket-doubts stem from a fear that
the co. has made little progress in its
attempts to regain the momentum lost,
apparently, with the death in 1956 of its
chairman and chief executive, J. J. Car-
roll. (After a lapse of 17 months the
appointment of a new managing-director
was announced last October.)
But the difficulties of the electrical
industry as a whole during the same
period should not be underestimated;
and, while the downturn in last year’s
earnings and the overall contraction in
balance-sheet figures tend to confirm the
sharemarket view, Email’s solid financial
structure, technical know-how and great
earning-potential can’t be disregarded.
Over the past month buyers of the
f.-p. ss. ords. have been inclined to acqept
shorter odds against an early improve-
ment in the co.’s fortunes, and bids have
risen from a “low” of 6s. 6d., in April,
to around 6s. lid. last week. At the
higher price, which is still more than 3s.
under the visible net tangible cover, the
return from an 8 p.c. div. would be
£5 15s. Bd. per cent.
The Email organisation came into exist-
ence in 1934 to merge the interests of two
Sydney concerns, Electricity Meter and
Manufacturing Co. Pty. and New System
Telephones Pty. Built-up, mainly, by the
absorption of existing cos. (shareholders
were last asked for additional capital in
1948), the group now consists of the
parent co. and over 40 subsidiaries and
affiliates, rapid and at times seemingly
haphazard, expansion giving it a wide
and diversified range of products. Paid
capital, £5,585,831, includes £lOO,OOO in
6 p.c. prefs.
Heavy electrical equipment (switch-
gear, generators, etc.), electric motors,
electricity meters, domestic refrigerators,
washing-machines, stoves, space- and
water-heaters, parking-meters, telephone-
registers, shop-fittings, wall-tiles and a
host of small domestic appliances are
among the lines turned out by the group’s
manufacturing-units, most of which are
located in N.S.W. or Victoria. Distribu-
tion, under such well-known brand-
names as WestinghOuse, Eicon, Emmco
and Airzone, is carried-out on an
Australia-wide basis.
The formation of a holding-co. to
amalgamate the interests of Email and
Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia), Ltd.,
was proposed in 1956, but, after lengthy
negotiations, the plan was dropped, the
two boards agreeing merely to extend
the “close liaison” already existing
between their respective cos.
Sales of refrigerators and other domes-
tic appliances picked-up over the second
half of last term (to December 31), but,
while the accounts reveal the group’s
financial strength, the major balance-sheet
movements suggest a further slip in total
turnover, falls in book-debts, etc. (down
£1,642,712 in two years), stocks (down
£593,961), creditors (down £427,881) and
“taxation, service and other provisions”
(down £756,092) showing-up along with
a £120,722 increase in the already sizeable
figure against cash, etc.
At the same time, the 50 p.c.-owned
T. R. Services Pty. ceased to be a sub-
sidiary, within the meaning of the
Companies Act, during the year and the
omission of that co.’s assets and liabilities
would have contributed to these move-
ments: —

The £178,606 increase in the amount
owing under debentures was of a tempor-
ary nature only, the repayment of 5 p.c.
debentures and the introduction of
£500,000 of fresh 6| p.c. debenture-money
early in the current term leaving the total
indebtedness virtually unchanged.
The altered status of T. R. Services
prevents a strictly accurate comparison
of last year’s earnings with those of the
preceding term, but, in itself, would
account for only a small proportion of
the £84,252 drop in net profit, which at
£505,555 was the smallest for five years.
Following the practice adopted in
previous years, the depreciation provi-
sion (up £11,655 at £622,098) appears to
be well in excess of the amount allowed
for taxation purposes, while no mention
is made at all of the tax-provision:

Cut from 9 p.c. to 8 p.c., the ord.

in both interim and final divs. for the
first time), and, with the earning-rate on
ord. capital running-out at 9.1 p.c., all
but £60,689 of the disclosed profit was
distributed.
The new management has had little
time yet in which to make changes.
Effective marshalling of the group’s
resources—a task requiring time as well
as managerial skill—appears to remain
as the board’s chief concern, and it may
be necessary to await next term’s results
before attempting to gauge the extent of
its success in this direction. Meanwhile,
sales and earnings in the first quarter of
the current term are reported to be in
excess of those recorded in the corres-
ponding period of last year.
City Mutual Life
■Record-breaking results have become
v a regular feature of the City Mutual’s
annual reports, last term’s 22 p.c.
increase in the sum assured under new
policies lifting new business to a record
level for the fifteenth consecutive year.
Participating to the full in the post-war
boom in life-assurance, the 79-year-old
society has doubled both its assets and
income within the last eight years, and —
as a wholly mutual concern —passed on
the benefits to policyholders by raising
bonus-rates on no less than six occasions
in the last seven years.
At December 31 last the City Mutual
had approximately 144,000 life-contracts
on its books. The co., which writes
ord inary -life policies only, operates in all
Australian States.
At £6,352,458 (up £641,011> total
income also reached a new peak last
term, a further £34,065 coming in as

After setting aside £2,153,817 to cover

A £33,206 provision for repairs was
written-back during the term and, together
with the £45,306 brought forward from
the previous year, brought the total
amount available for appropriation to
£1,605,352. Of this sum £1,390,618 was
allocated to provide reversionary bonuses,
at rates “substantially” higher than those
of the previous year, and £35,000 used

£4 18s. Id. p.c., further widening the
margin between the actual interest-rate
and the 2| p.c. on net premiums assumed
when estimating policy-liabilities.
Changes in the investment-pattern were
of a minor nature, but, as in the 1955
and 1956 terms, the amount advanced
under mortgages (including home-pur-
chase loans) increased at a faster rate
than the investment in Government
bonds, these two items accounting for
over 70 p.c. of the funds employed: —^

the life-fund stood at £36,127,003 and
visible reserves at £1,379,734.
Tax-concessions and the upward trend
in continue to draw attention to
the basic advantages of assurances as a
secure form of investment and protec-
tion. Latest figures from the Common-
wealth statistician show that in the first
eight months of the current financial year
Australian life-offices issued 337,191 new
policies assuring a total of £326.4 million,
as against the £282.9 million assured
under 329,123 life-contracts written in
the corresponding eight months of the
previous year.
Australian Aluminium Co., Ltd.
/Currently in the market for £3,000,000
of 7 p.c. debenture-money, Australian
Aluminium (“Australuco”) is well pro-
vided with wealthy and influential rela-
tives, the whole of its share-capital being
held, in equal parts, by Aluminium, Ltd.,
of Canada, and The British Aluminium
Co., Ltd., U.K.
The Canadian parent controls a group
of over 20 wholly- and partly-owned off-
shoots, and, through its principal sub-
sidiary, is the world’s largest exporter of
aluminium ingot. ■ Subsidiary interests
cover bauxite-mining, ingot-production,
fabrication and associated services, such
as power-generation and transport.
In addition to providing other English
and Canadian connections, the tie with
British Aluminium gives Australuco a
link with Commonwealth Aluminium
Corp. Pty., the co. formed last year, by
British Aluminium and Consolidated
Zinc Corp. to exploit the big bauxite
deposits at Weipa, Northern Queensland.
A cheap and abundant supply of electric
power is essential if the Weipa project
is to extend to the actual production of
aluminium, as distinct from alumina, and
the British co.’s interests also include a
49 p.c. shareholding in New Guinea
Resources Prospecting Co., Ltd., which,
among other things, is engaged in survey-
ing areas of New Guinea suitable for the
establishment of hydroelectric power-
stations.
Australuco’s paid capital consists of
1,000,000 f.-p. £1 ords. and 1,500,000 ords.
paid to Is. 4d. Most of the uncalled
£1,400,000 is earmarked for investment
in a modern aluminium-foil plant to be
erected in N.S.W. by the wholy-owned
subsidiary, Aluminium Foils (Australia)
Pty. The new foil-mill will be the only
one in Australia producing a full range
of foil products.
The £3,000,000, sought on 7 p.c.
registered mortgage-debenture stock, is
required to finance expansion of Aus-
traluco’s manufacturing facilities, includ-
ing extensions to the rolling-mill and
allied equipment at the main Granville
(Sydney) plant, where the co. turns-out
a wide range of rolled-, extruded- and
drawn-aluminium products. The pro-
posed expansion will increase extrusion-
capacity by 60 p.c. and more than double
rolling-capacity.
Debenture-stock may be taken-up for
a period of seven, 10 or 15 years, at the
option of the applicant, the co. reserving
the right to redeem the 15-year stock
between 1968 and 1972 at a premium
ranging from 5 p.c. (1968) to 1 p.c. (1972).
No more than £1,250,000 of seven-year
stock will be issued.
Based on conservative book-values, the
tangible asset backing for each £lOO
debenture was £236 at December 31 last.
Earnings for the year ended on the same
date covered the annual interest charge
1.75 times.

A/fORE than double the
previous term’s earning-
rate, over five times that of
1956, last year’s declared net
profit of £54,251, the second-
highest of flourmiller
Bruntons’ public career, never-
theless seemed too ephemeral
a gain to get the sharemarket
on-side; quotes for the scrip
remain as depressed as they
were following the downturn
of 1955, .with buyers, unim-
pressed by the higher 8 p.c.
dividend, last week offering
4s. 2d for the ss. ords.
In this oldest of Australia’s
export industries, a fairly
buoyant and remunerative
local market in recent years has
leavened the increasingly less-
palatable pickings overseas,
where not only are long-
established markets, particu-
larly in the Pacific and S. E.
Asian areas, losing their
traditional profitability, but are
even receding from the Aus-
tralian producer in the face of
subsidised American, Canadian,
W. German, French and Italian
competition, all the more en-
livened by last season’s crop-
failure, which made N. S.
Wales a wheat-importing State.
“For instance,” says chair-
man W. D. Brunton in his
annual address, “West German
flourmillers are subsidised for
the flour they export to the
extent of about 7s. 9d. Aus-
tralian per bushel on a wheat
basis, something like £l4 Aus-
tralian per ton of flour. The
export of flour is a big factor
in the economy of this country,
and if Australia is to hold these
markets the Federal Govern-
ment must assist the industry in
some way.”
Apparently the £28,833
(113 p.c.) lift in consolidated
net profit was entirely due to
wider margins on home sales,
but no figures are supplied for
turnover or operating expenses.
Group-earnings for the parent
and its operating subsidiaries,
Brunton and Co. Pty., Ltd.
(Sydney), and T. Brunton and
Co. Pty., Ltd. (Melbourne),
were calculated after writing-
out £38,205 (previous year
£13,422) for taxation and allow-
ing depreciation to the tune of
£20,395 (up £1554). A £5OOO
charge against gross earnings
for “deferred depreciation”
credited to reserves has been

a reduction of £59,178 in the

tinue ( to throw the burden of
supplying the export market on
to the Victorian offshoot,
whose mills in Melbourne and
at Rupanyup so far are coping
satisfactorily with this side of
the business, although predic-
tions are that total national
exports of wheat and wheat-

cial year (to June 30) will bring
in £3O million less than the
£7O million obtained in 1956-7.
Bruntons’' mill operations are
still on a “satisfactory” operat-
ing basis, but the board doesn’t
expect to maintain last year’s
earning-rate.


COMPANY MEETING
THE CONSOLIDATED ZINC CORPORATION LIMITED
SATISFACTORY FINANCIAL RESULT DESPITE LOWER METAL PRICES
The Ninth Annual Meeting of The Consolidated Zinc
Corporation Limited will be held at 37 Dover Street,
London, on the 24th June.
The following are extracts from the Statement by the
Chairman, Mr. L. B. Robinson, which has been circulated
with the reports and accounts for the year ended 31st
December, 1957:
FINANCIAL RESULTS
The severe fall in the prices of
lead and zinc during the last
eight months of the year caused
a substantial reduction in the
trading profits for 1957, which
amounted to £4,461,194 compared
with £6,250,323 for 1956.
The Zinc Corporation, Limited,
again increased ore production
and achieved a lower cost per
ton of ore at Broken Hill than
for the previous year. Neverthe-
less, the reduced average prices
realised for lead and zinc con-
centrates resulted in a much
lower profit than 1956.
Consolidated Zinc Proprietary
Limited had a satisfactory year
and showed a considerably in-
creased profit. This was due in
the main to better results being
achieved by the acid and super-
phosphate business of Sulphide
Corporation Pty. Limited, and to
satisfactory profits earned by
Titanium and Zirconium Indus-
tries Pty. Ltd.
Imperial Smelting Corporation
Limited had a lower output of
zinc but deliveries of alloys were
considerably greater than in
1956. Lithopone sales were at a
reduced level but sales of other
pigments compensated for this
decrease, while sales of sulphuric
acid were maintained. Profit
margins on most products were
reduced and, overall, the profits
from trading for the year in the
United Kingdom were somewhat
less than in 1956.
Income from trade investments
at £941,688 showed an increase
mainly due to higher dividends
from New Broken Hill Consoli-
dated Limited and British Titan
Products Company Limited. In-
terest on Government securities
and other interest and miscel-
laneous income, at £325,135, was
also higher than in 1956.
The consolidated profit of the
Group, before mining royalty and
taxation, amounted to £4,322,442,
compared with £6,123,432 for
1956.
Mining royalty payable to the
New South Wales Government on
the profits of the Zinc Corpora-
tion reflects the reduced profit
earned and amounted to £304,196,
compared with £1,021,533 for
1956.
Australian taxation, at £917,161
compared with £1,413,950 for
1956, the reduction being due
to the lower level of profits
earned in Australia.
The charge for United Kingdom
taxation, after allowing for relief
in respect of Australian taxation,
amounted to £1,326,966, compared
with £1,638,389 in 1956. Last year
I advised that it was unlikely that
any material benefit would accrue
to the Group from the provisions
in the Finance Act, 1957, relating
to Overseas Trade Corporations
and I have to confirm that this is
indeed the case.
Due to the considerably reduced
charge for royalty and taxation,
the consolidated net profit for
the year, at £1.769,986, was only
£274,397 lower than the net profit
for 1956.
Transfers of £750,000 have been
made to general reserves, compared
with £BOO,OOO for 1956.
An interim dividend of l/3d. per
share has been paid on the ordi-
nary shares, compared with l/6d.
per share for 1956.
It is proposed that a final divi-
dend of 2/6d. per share, compared
with 3/- per share last year, giving
a total distribution for the year
of 3/9d. per share compared with
4/fid. per share last year.
Capital expenditure during the
year on mining property totalled
£331,515 and related to the develop-
ment work on the bauxite deposits
on Cape York Peninsula and other
properties. Capital expenditure on
buildings, plant and equipment
amounted to £1,436,720 and there
were outstanding commitments at
the end of the year of £1,477,000.
LEAD & ZINC MINING
In the prevailing conditions of
world markets in which, in com-
mon with many other commodities.
a surplus of lead and Zinc has
developed, both the Zinc Corpora-
tion and New Broken Hill Con-
solidated have budgeted for a
reduced production of ore and
recoverable metals during the
current year. At the same time, it
has been, and remains, the earnest
desire and policy of these Com-
panies to keep intact the splendid
organisation of staff and employees
built up over the past years, and
accordingly, since the commence-
ment of operations in 1958 a large
group of men has been transferred
from ore extraction to development
work. The development pro-
grammes in recent years have pro-
vided ample working places for
production requirements, and this
transfer will therefore mean the
undertaking of development far in
advance of that necessary for the
normal operation of the mines. In
addition, in February of this year
arrangements were concluded with
the Unions for a suspension of
operations throughout the Broken
Hill field on one day per fortnight,
equivalent to a reduction of 10% in
working time. It will, of course,
be the policy of the Companies to
revert to full and normal operat-
ing conditions just as soon as the
outlook appears more favourable.
ZINC SMELTING
Zinc production in the United
Kingdom by Imperial Smelting
Corporation was a little below
the level of 1956. The operation
of the Imperial Smelting process
on the Avonmouth site made
further satisfactory progress
during the year.
As a result of a technical paper
presented to the Institution of
Mining and Metallurgy in August
last, wide publicity was given to
our process and enquiries have
been received from many zinc
smelting companies throughout the
world.
A decision has also recently been
taken to replace the horizontal
retort zinc distillation plant at our
Swansea Yale works with the in-
stallation of an Imperial Smelting
process plant. The Swansea fur-
nace will have more than double
the capacity of the enlarged fur-
nace now operating at Avonmouth,
and it is expected that it will be
completed by the end of 1960.
In Australia progress has been
made with the design and general
planning for the new smelter which,
as announced last year, is to be
built at the works of Sulphide
Corporation Pty., Limited, at Cockle
Greek, near Newcastle. New South
Wales. The negotiation for long-
term arrangements for the haulage
of concentrates from Broken Hill
to Cockle Creek and for other
essential services has not yet been
fully concluded, but we are hopeful
that a satisfactory settlement of
all these matters wil be reached at
an early date. In the meantime, we
are proceeding with an extension
of sulphuric acid capacity to meet
anticipated long-term increases in
superphosphate demand, and this
will be .designed to be suitable for
operation on smelter gases.
RUTILE AND ZINC
Outputs of rutile and zircon by
Titanium and Zirconium Industries
Pty. Ltd. from beach sands at
Stradbroke Island, Queensland,
were at substantially increased
levels, and the company had a suc-
cessful year. Whilst profits for the
current year are also expected to be
satisfactory, there has been a
drastic curtailment in the produc-
tion of titanium metal which has
obscured the future outlook for
rutile.
„ BAUXITE
Commonwealth Aluminium Cor-
poration Pty. Limited, in which
the British Aluminium Company
Limited will be associated'with u 3,
has during the year made substan-
tial progress in its investigation
and planning for the development
of the bauxite deposits at Weipa
on the West Coast of Cape York
Peninsula.
In December a comprehensive
agreement was negotiated with the
State of Queensland providing for
the development, of the field. The
term of the agreement is 84 years
with a right of extension for a
further 21 years.
A feature of the agreement is
Commonwealth Aluminium Corpor-
ation’s undertaking to establish an
alumina plant in Queensland as
soon as practicable after the Com-
pany has completed its investiga-
tions. Much of the year's work
has been directed towards further
testing of the bauxite deposits and
towards establishing that the in-
dustry’s requirements can be eco-
nomically met. In the Weipa and
nearby areas more than 300 square
miles have so far been investigated
and, of these, 160 square miles have
been shown to bear bauxite of corn-
merical interest.
Apart from bauxite proving
much work has been carried out
on chemical testing, investigatiou
of water and power resources and
other elements in a preliminary
economic assessment of alumina
production. A hydrographic
survey has been made of the
estuaries and seaward approaches
suited to the establishment of a
port near Weipa.
I mentioned year that a
joint venture by the Common-
wealth Government and the British
Aluminium Company had earlier
indicated certain deposits of
bauxite on the north coast of
Australia west of the Gulf of
Carpentaria. I am happy to say
that these deposits—in the Gove
Peninsula —have been the subject
of successful negotiations with the
Commonwealth Government as a
result of which they will be eon-
colidated with the other interests
of Commonwealth Aluminium Cor-
poration and investigated jointly
with the Weipa deposits. 1
Earlier in the year the Common-
wealth Government accepted in
principle an offer made for the
purchase of its interest in the New
Guinea Resources Prospecting
Company. Since 1950 the Comrnon-
(Continued on page 31)


wealth and the British Aluminium
Company have, through that Com-
pany, been investigating the hydro-
electric potential of water resources
in Papua, New Guinea, These re-
sources, particularly in the Purari
River, have since been inspected
by us and investigations of them
will now be taken to a more con-
clusive stage. They are, however,
essentially related to the question
of aluminium metal production—
a matter which Commonwealth
Aluminium Corporation is pursu-
ing as its principal objective. If,
however, a market for alumina can
be developed at an intermediate
stage, it will hasten the establish-
a new industry in Queens-
land.
Work on several possible sources
of power supplies will constitute an
important part of operations in
the immediate future. The out-
come of investigations into Queens-
land coal resources for aluminium
smelting could influence the site
chosen for the alumina plant as
well as the fuel to be used for that
plant. In this connection a five-
year option has been secured over
the Blair Athol coalfield in the
central coastal region of Queens-
land.
The past year has seen some
notable progress towards our
objective, but I would emphasise
again this year that we do not
underestimate either the magnitude
of the task or the time required
to bring our plans to fruition. In
common with other non-ferrous
metals aluminium is at present ex-
periencing a phase of over-supply
throughout the world. However,
this new project is essentially a
long-term one, and we have no
doubt that the Weipa deposits will
be the foundation of an industrial
development that will in due
course bring great benefit to the
Australian economy and assYnne
an important role in the world’s
aluminium industry.
MELBOURNE OFFICE
In 1949 we acquired the present
premises of the Australian Head
Office of the Group at 95 Collins
Street, with the intention of re-
constructing the building, at the
appropriate time. The expansion
of our activities in Australia has
now' reached a stage wdiere addi
tional accommodation is required
and it has therefore been decided
to proceed with the reconstruction.
The greater proportion of the cost
of the building will be met by a
loan from outside sources under
a long-term financial arrangement.
During the period of reconstruc-
tion office accommodation has been
secured at 53 Flemington Road,
North Melbourne.
LEAD & ZINC MARKETS
Since I last reviewed the lead/
zinc situation there have been
important changes in the world
economic scene, and the main brunt
of a reversad of the inflationary
movement has fallen on inter-
national commodities. Last year I
also referred to the problems that
would emerge with a change in
U.S. stockpiling policy. This
change came about all too soon
thereafter, with the added threat,
now embodied in recommendations
from the U.S. Tariff Commission,
of increased duties or even quotas
on imports into that market.
Additionally the situation has
become still more confused by the
publication of the U.S. Govern-
ment’s own plan to subsidise
domestic production at guaranteed
price levels for fixed tonnages.
During the same twelve month
period we have also suffered from
a continuing liquidation of stocks’
in the United Kingdom held by the
Board of Trade, although I am
pleased to say that, temporarily
at least, sales of zinc from that
source have been suspended.
All these factors have had a
sevexre effect on prices, and since
May of last year lead and zinc
have suffered a loss on the London
Metal Exchange of approximately
40%. Unfortunately the prospects
for improvement in the present
position of over-supply of these
metals are further obscured by the
uncertainties of the. general con-
dition of trade throughout the
world, and in particular by the
steps being taken, or prosed in
various countries, notably the
U.S.A., for the protection and even
expansion of domestic production.
In these circumstances it is diffi-
cult, if not impossible, to forecast
an early improvement in prices but
it is, I believe, quite clear that a
higher level will be essential to
sustain the production of these
metals necessary to meet the con-
tinued progress towards a higher
standard of living throughout the
world.
Shareholders will remember that
on previous occasions we have sug-
gested that a combined lead/zinc
price in the United Kingdom of
around £175 would prove satis-
factory for both producers and
consumers. This figure is, I would
emphasise, some way below the
level which the U.S. Government
during its stockpiling programme
considered not only reasonable but
worthy of support, and I still
believe that a combined price of
' £175 will in the long run be re-
quired to meet the needs of world
markets.
THE OUTLOOK
In the current year our earnings
must be seriously affected by the
present low level of ptices. How-
ever, in spite of the unfavourable
features in the immediate outlook
for commodity prices and in the
statistical position of the rpetals
which at present provide our main
source of income, we remain confi
dent that the world will continue
to progress to higher standards
of living and that not only demand
will increase, but that the prices
of the metals in whij;h we are
interested will, in time, return to
more remunerative levels. Mean-
while, we consider the projects in
hand to improve the efficiency and
economic return from our existing
operations are essential even
though the timing and rate of pro-
gress of these projects must neces-
x sarily be governed by our financial
resources.
On behalf of the board and
myself I express sincere thanks
to our management staff and em-
ployees for their loyal support and
efficient service in 1957, and our
confidence in their continued co-
operation in successfully meeting
the problems that confront us in
the coming years.

MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
Wellington, June 3.
HPhough Britain’s decision on
A the butter-dumping case
drew strong official expressions
of disappointment, the general
feeling seems to be one of
thankfulness for small mercies.
Britain has asked Finland
and Sweden to stop dumping
butter or to keep their exports
within agreed limits, and has
warned them that, if they don’t
do so, countervailing duties
will be imposed. Eire has been
asked to enter into consulta-
tions on a similar basis, and
the case of Argentina is still
being considered.
N.Z. has achieved a notable
intangible gain. It has obtained
from Britain a straightforward
admission—which will be of
major importance in any
future negotiations that
imports of butter subsidised
by the three importing-
countries named “have caused
material injury to the N.Z.
dairy industry.”
Action Against Dumping
Britain expects that the
action it is taking will, over
a year, have the effect of
reducing supplies of butter on
the U.K. market by an amount
equal to about 10 per cent, of
the 1957 total that is, by
about 40,000 tons.
That does not mean, how-
ever, that supplies in 1958 will
be 40,000 tons less than in
1957. In fact, as the chairman
of the N.Z. Dairy Products
Marketing Commission, R. A.
Candy, has pointed - out,
because of heavy imports from
dumping-countries in the early
months of the year, total
supplies of butter in the U.K.
in 1958 will be considerably
higher than in 1957, even
allowing for the reduction
contemplated.
Last year Britain imported
400,000 tons of butter. This
year the estimated amount is
450,000 tons. So that, even if
the expected reduction is
achieved, there will still be
410,000 tons on the market, or
10.000 tons more than last year.
These figures make it clear
that the British authorities’
estimate that the price of butter
on the U.K. market wifi- rise
by 6d. a pound is based on
guesswork—and could prove
completely wrong.
It is very unlikely .that the
London price will rise beyond
2305. a cwt., or 2405. at the
most, whereas, to cover the
present N.Z. guaranteed price,
it would have to be about 3445.
a cwt.
Having done what it can in
Britain, N.Z. must now reso-
lutely set about putting its own
house in order. It has no time
to lose.
The Government has called
for facts and figures on all
aspects of the guaranteed
price, and its departmental
officers are investigating pro-
posals for diversification of
farming.
It is, of course, now quite
clear that the guaranteed price
must come down.
A cut of 15 p.c. has been
suggested as likely. If such a
cut were made, and if the
London price of butter
averaged 2405. a cwt., there
would still be a gap of £lO
million to £l2 million that
would have to be financed by-
other means.
There is little likelihood that
any attempt will he made to fill
the gap, whatever it may be,
by means of taxation. Any
proposal to subsidise the dairy-
farmer at the expense of the
general taxpayer would arouse
a roar of protest.
Whatever help has to be
given will probably be by way
of loan to the industry through
the Reserve Bank. The effect
will, of course, be inflationary.
Farmers’ leaders have been
busy preparing them for a cut
in income. The publicity-
officer of the N. Z. Dairy
Board, C. W. Burnard, said
recently that farmers would be
completely unrealistic if they
pressed the Government for a
guaranteed price which would
return them 100 p.c. of their
costs. He would be amazed if,
after reading recent statements
by Ministers of the Crown and
the president of the Federation
of Labor, there were dairy-
farmers who still believed that
there was any intention on the
part of the Government other
than to make a savage cut in
the present price.
The first part of these
remarks poiqts-up the unreal
character of the guaranteed-
price structure. Lewis Carroll
might well have dreamed it up.
During the current year
farmers have been receiving a
price deliberately fixed at 5
p.c. less than their declared
“cost of production.” But no
one would suggest that any of
them have been doing other
than “nicely.” The obvious
conclusion is that the “cost of
production” figure is com-
pletely unrealistic.
By sticking to it farmers only
arouse the antagonism of the
rest of the community, who,
even if only by loan, will soon
be asked to help them. They

Pumpkin-moon
By E. A. GOLLSCHEWSKY
< 4 -■ —on’t you think,
1 Mother,” said Lucille
JL>/ defiantly, with a toss
of the red plume
which jutted out from the back
of her head, “that Grandpa
could plant something other
than pumpkins for a change?”
“Such as?”
“W ell, sweet - corn. Or
asparagus. Or even
avocadoes”
“What are avocadoes? They
sound rather Spanish.”
“Perhaps they are. We had
them on cheese-biscuits at
Glenda’s birthday-party oh,
Mother, don’t sidetrack me! I
want to get this pumpkin-
business cleared-up once and
for all. I think it’s silly for
people like us on a red-soil
cane-farm, with a house that’s
been in country magazines as
a recommended style for tropi-
cal farms, and Daddy chair-
man of the shire-council and—
and John married to a lady
doctor and me driving my own
car to high-school, to have
practically a pumpkin-patch at
our front door. I think it’s very
incongruous.”
Her mother was having
people in for bridge later on
and had only half a mind to
spare for her daughter. It
always took such a lot of
preparation flowers, tables,
score-pads, and sorting packs
of cards. The windows of the
sun-room were opened wide to
the early evening, letting in a
few flying-ants and mos-
quitoes, but the view was so
lovely she never could bring
herself to keep them closed,
or to disfigure them with
meshed wire. The scent from
the citrus-orchard rose pun-
gent, delicate and clean, and
beyond that stretched acres
of young sugarcane, brilliant
against the chocolate soil,
green blade-leaves twisting,
shining, rustling faintly in the
cool breeze from the sea.
“What have you against
pumpkins, dear?”
“I think they’re terrible. So
plebeian. The very name” —-
she shuddered with overdone
fastidious.
“Oh, I don’t know. Take
onions.' But can you do with-
out onions? Anyway, he
doesn’t grow them at the front-
door, they’re in the old lucerne-
paddock this year. And I never
would have thought that that
bit of shoddy grey soil there
would grow such beauties, I
must admit.”
A look of agonised frustra-
tion from Lucille recalled her
to the matter in hand, and
hastily, guiltily, defensively she
added, “Grandpa does love his
pumpkins and he’d be lost
without them, I’m sure.”
“But don’t you see, Mother?
We’ve progressed beyond
pumpkins. People say to me,
‘And how are old Mr. Zeiner’s
pumpkins this year?’ Or, ‘My,
your grandfather has a fine
crop on the vines. Nobody
can grow pumpkins like your
grandfather.’ Well, who wants
to, anyway? It’s humiliating,
Mother. Mother?”
“Now, Lucille” —
“Oh, but you’re his daughter,
aren’t you? You’re a German,
too. How could you be
expected to know that pump-
kins are just simply frightfully
common and —and belittling.
Pumpkins!”
TTer mother stared uncom-
prehendingly, thinking how
selfish and vain and silly girls
were at that age, but conscious
at the same time that she
must be understood and
handled sympathetically.
Lucille was lovely in her youth
and blind arrogance, and not
really stupid at all. Just young.
“I was born in this country
and well you know it. I’m as
' Australian as you are. And I
won’t have you casting slurs
on Grandpa. He was only a boy
when he came out and he’s
forgotten he ever was German,
except for little tricks of speech
he can’t get out of.”
Loyalty to the old man
had sharpened her tone. But
Lucille was right, in a way.
-She did have the square, dark,
coarse-grained face of her Ger-
man forebears. They were not
fair; their skin tended to a
swarthy oiliness, tough and
indestructible, slow to show
age or the effects of a broiling
sun, and their build was a short,
thick stockiness, strong, firmly
planted on the earth.
She added, with a spurt
of characteristic stubbornness,
“He does grow the best pump-
kins in the district; that’s what
they’re all jealous of.”
“Who cares? Oh, wh o
cares!” Lucille dramatised
wildly. “Is it any honor to
grow a pumpkin as big as a
pig’s bucket?”
“Perhaps it is.”
Neat, unimaginative, with
her dark, strong, wiry hair
parted in the centre, she lifted
her head high and left the sun-
room, terminating the argu-
ment. From the back her neck
looked short and thick, burned
brown from many hours’
working in her garden.
Through the living - room
with its gleaming cedar floor,
its radiogram, deep rugs, steel-
and-plastic furniture, oil-paint-
ings hung low, chrome-and-
glass coffee-tables, she went;
past the bathroom with its
g\ ill e r and perfumes, the
phdne-booth, the cloak-cup*-
board, dining-room complete
with dark, gleaming furniture,
and so into the modern, airy
kitchen with all its labor-saving
devices.
Time was, she thought,
switching-on the electric fire
and beginning to make ready
the evening meal, when Lucille
had been pleased to have her
very own pumpkin in the
patch, with her name scratched
in the pearly, green-white skin
and rising into a clear cicatrice
as the pumpkin grew and
ripened in the sun. John would
have chosen his, too, and
scraped his name on the
plumply swelling side, adding
M.D. after it because even
when he was a boy he wanted
to be a doctor. He had mar-
ried one instead, and become
a farmer like his father.
Together they would go down
and pick out some special
pumpkins, carving H.V. on
them, so that everybody knew
these were destined for the
church altar when harvest-
festival time came round. And
some would have her own


name, Emma, on them, carved
beside an arrowed heart with
the name of some impossible
person linked with it —her
husband’s nonsense.
r T"HE voices of her husband
and her father floated up
through the wide-flung case-
ments as she rubbed garlic
round the inside of a wooden
bowl and began to dribble in
the oil and vinegar and the
cream, a German dish of spiced
cucumbers they all loved.
As usual, the voices carried
no hint of conflict or anger,
either hidden or revealed
openly. They were serene,
companionable voices, salted
with obscenities, breaking into
grunted laughter. They were
good friends, these two; the
old man (who had made his
barren selection into a mixed
farm and dairy which pros-
pered by sheer indefatigable
courage and toil, and the
younger one who had been
left this established cane-farm
by a station-owning squatter
grandfather. Different in every
way, they shared a love for
the land, and cloaked their
love in continuous upbraiding.
“Asparagus! ” spat Emma
scathingly to herself. “As if
either of them is the asparagus-
growing type!”
At table she tried to steer
the conversation away from
pumpkins. Lucille’s full
bottom-lip hung mutinously.
Grandpa Zeiner, having
removed his outside-boots and
his bottom-teeth, was ready to
eat. He rubbed stockinged feet
together in an anticipatory
way, as a money-lender rubs
his hands at the prospect of a
client. Those who carried with
them a picture of all Germans
as big, fair and phlegmatic
would never have picked this
merry-eyed, dark man with the
nose and forehead of a gnome
to be of German stock. But
the marks were there; the
squat, solid body, the heavy-
set shoulders, the slow-moving,
low-slung hips, told of genera-
tions of plodding peasantry,
born to grow small crops, born
to prosper, born to want
nothing from life than a piece
of ground to till.
Opposite him, relishing the
sweet-sour cucumbers, sat his
son-in-law, Angus Mackay,
red-haired, blunt-spoken, rosy-
cheeked, who farmed in a
grandiose fashion, on a large
and lordly scale, employing
field-hands, tractor-drivers, a
dairy-boy ; sending, during the
crushing season, hundreds of
tons of cane away to the mill
every week ; taking his place
in civic activities; living soft
and easy, holidaying on the
Gold Coast or the Barrier
Reef; yet nourishing within
his spare, Scottish frame a
deep-rooted communion with
his land as obvious' and as
undeniable as old man Zeiner’s.
Lucille’s mutinous silence
caught his attention at last.
“What’s wrong? ” he
demanded. “Lovesick?”
“Oh, Daddy, you’re limited.
You can’t ever think N of any-
thing else but that.”
Frankly curious, Emma
asked, “How on earth do you
know?”
Lucille shrugged. “Well, he
brings women or sex or stal-
lions or heifers on heat into
every single subject that crops-
up. There’s no mystery in it
any more for me, and I’m only
seventeen.”
Zeiner splut-
” tered tea and cakecrumbs
aside. Emma and Angus
looked at each other and
grinned.
“On a farm such things are
natural,” Emma said with
finality.
Lucille pushed her plate
away. Grandpa ate with all
the lusty vigor of his 70-odd
years, the light glowing tawny
on his brown skin.
“Mrs. Carpentar came’ out
in her new utility,” he said,
triumphantly, looking round
the table at them and then
bursting into a delighted
chuckle. “For a load of my
pumpkins for the store. Least,
that’s what she said brought
her. But she had a twinkle in
her eye, yet, and she tells a
pretty dirty yarn. Reckon she’s
been a widdy too long. Not
that I’m much use to her, but
I guess she reckons there’s a
kick in the old mule yet.”
He winked obscenely.
“Oh!” Lucille stared at him
despairingly. “You, too!
Don’t you ever think about
anything but women and
pumpkins? Don’t you?”
. “What’s more worth talking
about than a pretty, plump
widdy-woman with a bit of life
in her skirt? Tell me that. And
what’s more satisfying to a
man’s soul. than the sight of
a well-grown, well-matured
Beaudesert Blue, with that
beautiful tinge of color in her
skin and her sides all swelling
tight fit to bust, a good, hard
curve under the feel of yoßir
hand? Tell me that.”
“There are other things in
life”—Lucille was close to
tears. She saw that her parents
were listening closely to the
old man, their eyes a little
dreamy.
“There’s travel and world
affairs —poetry —books”
But the old man waved her
aside with an arrogance equal-
ling her own. “When I was a
little fella my father used a
well-grown cow-pumpkin as a
globe, to teach me some geo-
graphy. At night he sat beside
the kerosene-lamp carving-out
the countries, and with a steel
knitting-needle he printed-in
the names. I loved every inch
of that world.”
He added thoughtfully, “I
still do, in spite of everything.”
Angus muttered that he sup-
posed these things had to be ;
and, plainly, they were talking
about Emma’s brother who’d
been killed in the war, or was
it just the drought? Who
knew?
Emma cleared her throat and
said that for her part she pre-
ferred a nice Crown. There
was something about a Crown-
pumpkin, with its neat little
pale circle folded into the top,
but of course Ironbarks really
were the best keepers. Their
skin was a veritable shell,
resistant to mould, rot and
borer alike. She’d kept Iron-
barks for over a year on the
shelves in the barn, and just as
delicious then, they were, as
when they were first picked.
Orange- yellow flesh, dry,
flavorsome —
“Pumpkins aren’t what they
used to be, though.” Grandpa
was firmly regretful. “I used
to grow Triambles that looked
like a tortured Siamese twins’
nightmare large, contorted
things with bumps on them
like a fat woman's backside.
Talk about modernistic sculp-
ture . . . now, Lucille, you can
talk all you like about culture
and art, but nothing that-there
Dali ever thought-up looked
like one of my Triambles. I
grew ’em in an abandoned pig-
sty. They were something like
pumpkins, I can tell you.”
Angus, with a wary glance
at Emma, said he well
remembered the pUmpkin-pies
his mother used to make. She
would put butter and sugar
and treacle and spices in with
the pumpkin.
He added, openly apologetic
to Emma this time, “It was a
golden ambrosia, that stuff,
and she had a kanaka cook
who used to roll-out th e
pastry with thin, nimble, black
fingers.”
For once she was not resent-
ful of his appreciation of any-
one else’s cooking. Her mind
was elsewhere.
“The smell of cooking
pumpkin hung over the farms
of the German cockies,” Emma
said sadly. “It didn’t smell like
ambrosia to us. We boiled it
up with young corncobs for
the dinner-table ; we boiled it
up in kerosene-tins outside for
the pigs. We chopped it up
and cooked it with sorghum
for the fowls. I remember we
used to talk about it and
wonder if the smell of pump-
kin would be exuded through
the pores of our skin, like the
smell of shallots breathes out
of the skin of Chinese.”
“We had little else to eat,”
said her father defensively.
“All our cream went to the
factory to bring back money
for necessities. Those times we
didn’t have bank-managers to
eat with us —we i;an and hid
in the scrub when we saw
them coming. They held our
mortgages.”
This quip was about Angus
and Emma’s guests of the night
before. He’d already made it
once to the bank-manager and
his wife and son. It had gone
over big, with much laughter.
Old Zeiner could say what he
liked, nowadays. They had
their eye on Lucille for their
son Stan, and would be grati-
fied if the match came-off. The
old man was wealthy and had
influence, apart altogether from
the Mackay credentials. There
was, they were fond of saying,
something so safe about the
land.
“Couldn’t you have killed
pigs or ducks or something?”
Lucille’s pretty nosc'wrinkled
in distaste. She was wise in
the ways of modern cane-
farming, and would order a

TOUCH OF FEELING
Water’s weighted in a wave,
as smooth as jelly,
soft skinned as belly
on which four fingers move.
How placid is consistency
of skin or cream or cakes
—until awareness wakes.
Skin pores are vibrant,
a subtle hydrant
moved by mind’s inconstancy.
Cream is biologically alive,
more active than a hive
and when a cake is baked
the crest is cracked.
How light is touch
that can and cannot tell so
much.
Not only glancing eyes
can register surprise.

The Trip
By ROY THEODORE
He was what his mother
had called a peaky boy;
thin, wan, with a slow,
almost invalid interest
in the things about him. A
doctor might have called it
simply malnutrition. Without
moving he hugged himself
tighter into his invisible cocoon.
The car slicked on through the
steady rain.
“Gould I open the window a
little?” he asked at last.
Joe, the driver, looked at him
in the mirror a moment.
“What’s the matter, boy?
It’s all right as it is, isn’t it?”
The boy said nothing more.
To the man beside him Joe
said, “Only got it before we
came down for the races. Not
house-proud, but a man
doesn’t want the rain wetting
these covers first up.”
“Not a bad bus, this model,”
said the other man. “Excellent
pick-up, you know? Peppy
too.”
It made Joe happy. “I’ll say:
Watch this, Bill.” He braked
fairly sharply so that the two
wives squeezing the boy into
a corner of the back-seat
protested. Then he accelerated,
working through the gears
rapidly.
“Excellent pick-up,” repeated
Bill.
The wives went back to their
own conversation. The men
had met before, but the wives,
strangers an hour before, were
almost stagily reserved. They
probed and prodded delicately
for common ground. Joe’s wife
ironed a finger along one of
the gloves that lay in her lap.
Would Joe suggest stopping for
a drink? Did she drink? She
was too quiet—was she always
like this? Not our sort really,
Joe . . . was she?
Covertly she took in the
woman’s neat white-and-grey
costume. “I see that ballet-
company is coming north, Mrs.
Hastings,” she said. “Do you
Mike the ballet?”
Bill picked-up the query and
screwed in his seat.
“Who, May? Few too many
pansies in that for us, eh,
May?”
She looked at her husband as
though he was for a moment
something odd, and then she
smiled him away to Joe’s wife.
“I’m afraid I haven’t had
the chance to see as much
ballet as I should like to.”
Bill turned back to the
driver. “Give me the pip, those
ballet-dames, you know, Joe?
Built like a lot of racehorses
—only they’d all flop in a heap
if they smelt a bit of manure.”
Joe laughed easily. “Speak-
ing of horses, that nag of yours
did well.”
“Yeah . . . Should keep Mc-
Govern happy all right. Only
passed him over two months
ago, you know—he had Masters
training it for him till then.”
“You did a good job on it.”
“Yeah; I worked on him.
Feed was the main thing. Put
him on the right stuff and he
bounced out of hi§ skin. And
work —gotta work him like
a Clydesdale to get anywhere.
That’s where Masters went
wrong. Mainly feed, though;
that was the main thing.”
Tt was growing even warmer
•*- in the car, but no one except
the boy seemed to mind. There
was a heavy smell of the
perfume Joe’s wife had dabbed
on hastily when she had heard
they were to bring Bill and his
wife back with them. The men
were smoking.
The boy breathed in slowly,
trying to sieve the smells from
the air he took in. The car had
reached another small town. It
slowed, so that the slick-slick of
the tyres on the wet asphalt
could be heard.
“Beer, Bill?” asked Joe.
Joe’s wife looked out of the
corner of her eye as Bill
assented. “That would be nice,”
said May.
Joe’s wife felt easier.
As they climbed out, Joe
said to the boy: “Have a look
at the shops till we come back.
But don’t get too far from the
car.”
His wife almost spoke to the
boy, but suddenly felt strangely
irritated by his presence and
walked into the hotel with May.
Sheltered from the rain by
the shop-verandas, the boy
looked into the windows. Lawn-
mowers, washing - machines,
refrigerators. He read the price-
tags earnestly, trying to
memorise both the cash-prices
and the terms. It was always
useful to know prices.
The special coldness of a
small town’s main street
broomed its Idneliness about
him. He was cold, but he told
himself you weren’t really cold
unless you admitted you were.
Looking at his goosefleshed
arms he said it wasn’t cold,
really.
The car set-off again, the
women losing their reserve
now; and the boy felt his
queasiness had gone with the
brief stop. But now there was
stale beer in the air.
May leaned across Joe’s wife
to speak to him: “So now
you’re all alone, little boy.
You’ll have to be very brave,
won’t you?”
They had been talking about
him. You’ll have to be very
brave. “Yes,” he said, not look-
ing at her.
How many times 12s. 6d. a
week made £B5?
“Never mind, Nipper,” said
Joe. “You’ll be okay with your
uncle ; he’s a good bloke.”
“Yes.” He couldn’t ignore
the smell of beer.
“Could I open my window
a little?”
“Just wait till the rain stops,”
said Joe. “Here, I’ll open the
vent.”
Hie boy waited for the smells
to go. The vent seemed to
make no difference. He was
hungry, too.
The countryside was mourn-
fully dark-green. It seemed to
have given-in to the weather.
Untidy macrocarpa-hedges had
warped the way of the wind.
Grey trees pointed whichaway
fingers into the late-afternoon
sky. Flax-bush and gorse
tangled for possession of the
water-sogged paddocks. Cows
and a few scattered houses
stood rumps to the westerly.
But in the car it was hot and
sour-smelly.
The boy felt the saliva rush
suddenly to his mouth ; he was
giddy. How many 12s. 6ds. in
£B5? he thought desperately. If
only he could eat. He gulped
the saliva down and then his
mouth went tight-dry and
threatening. He fought-off the
sickness. He felt it lie just below
his throat, ready to surge again.
“Who’s got the food?” said
Joe. “I’m hungry.”
May began unwrapping
sandwiches in a basket.
The boy brought up the small
carton that had. been lying at
his feet. Inside were sandwiches
and two bananas. He was about
to untie the • string when he
stopped. Inside were also two
pet mice.
“Did you bring some food
with you?” May asked him.
“N-no,” he said.
She looked at him with soft
curiosity. “Here then, have a
sandwich.”
“I’m not very hungry, thank
you.”
“Oh, go on! No wonder
you’re so small if you don’t
eat. Here, you have a sand-
wich.”
He nibbled it slowly to show
them he wasn’t hungry. He
rolled each bite about quietly
until it dissolved in his mouth.
“What are the holes for in
your box?” asked Joe’s wife.
“Dunno,” he said, easing it
to the floor again.
“You haven’t got a cat in
there, have you?” she joked.
“No.” He resumed his
window-watching. He should
have carried the food separately.
He could have just put it in
brown paper and carried it in
his hand. If they offered him
another sandwich he would
say: “No, really, I ate just
before you picked me up.”
Bill pulled the top from a
bottle of beer and filled glasses.
Joe drank as he drove.
“You shouldn’t!” said his
wife.
“Don’t be such an old fuss-
pot,” he laughed.
“No, Joe; I’m serious.
You’ve got others in the car to
think of besides yourself.”
“Look who wanted to get
home before dark,” he replied
irritably, draining the glass.
May stepped on the silence!
“What do you want to be when
you grow-up, little boy?”
“A farmer.”
“My now, fancy that. That
will be lovely.”
He didn’t. He wanted to
Work in an office and have hot
pies for lunch. But when he
said that they always asked
why he didn’t want to be a
farmer like his father had been.
The car reached Maniwai.
The boy had spent a holiday
there with a friend of his
father’s . . . Memory gave him
a glimpse of his struggles to get
the cows through the sucking
grey mud to the yard . . . the
tears over a failing Taranaki-
gate that he couldn’t close . . .
a leaky roof and the lavatory
with wet sawdust . . . the white
bathroom-towel that the woman
always said was dirty no matter
how hard he washed his
hands . . .
This time he had almost no
warning and as he felt it rising
in his throat he grabbed
desperately for the window-
handle. It was the door-handle

The Premiers Meet Again-
LOANS AND TAXES
Last week’s Loan Council meeting
and Premiers’ Conference followed
the pattern that the years have
made familiar, though with much
less of the sound and fury that seemed
inseparable from these gatherings a few
years ago.
The truth is that the sound and fury
was always largely synthetic. It was
genuine enough to the extent that it
represented the attempts of the State
Premiers and Treasurers to get as much
loan-money and tax-reimbursement funds
as they could out of the Federal coffers;
the fake lay in the pretence that the sums
sought by the States were the irreducible
minimum without which disaster would
overwhelm them.
Most of the principals on stage last
week were old hands at the game; they
had played their part many times before
and hoped to play it again. There were
some exceptions. Federal Treasurer Sir
Arthur Fadden was making a farewell
appearance, and Queensland Premier
Nicklin was participating in his first
full-scale show, though he had appeared
in a matinee performance last February.
N.S.W. Premier Cahill, probably the
most able exponent of the tale-of-woe
technique that Canberra has seen, was
a notable absentee, being on a visit to
New York where, according to stage-
whispers, he was seeking a Broadway
engagement. His place was well filled,
however, by Deputy Premier Heffron.
Turkey or Tomtit?
TTeffron was no stranger to Loan
Council proceedings. He had under-
studied Cahill on previous occasions,
including the memorable gathering in
1953 when, with all the Premiers except
Playford still abroad on post-Coronation
tours, five Deputy Premiers sat-in at the
Canberra talks. Loan Council proceed- ’
ings are not,reported, but the records of
the Premiers’ Conference show that the
deputies knew their parts well. A total of,
£166 million was sought from the 1953-54
taxation-pool, variously described by the
speakers as cutting-up the turkey, the
duck, the crow and the tomtit. This
represented an increase of £3l million on
the previous year’s bird. When the Prime
Minister said the Commonwealth was not
prepared to go beyond £142 million the
cries of the Deputy Premiers were heart-
rending enough to arouse every specimen
in the nearby Commonwealth Institute
of Anatomy, though not enough to stir
Menzies and Fadden, who had become
inured to such plaints.
Mr. Heffron said that to say he was
deeply shocked would be to put it. too
mildly. He was astounded. The P.M.’s
proposal was so incredible he could hardly
believe it was meant to be taken seriously.
His State had already cut expenditure so
touch that in some cases it looked like
economy run mad ; taxation had been
increased to the limit. Unless the Com-
monwealth was prepared to increase the
reimbursement the States would have to
return home and announce “that unem-
ployment will occur and that public works
will have to be neglected.”
Nor was Heffron alone. Galvin (Vic.)
vowed that it would be “impossible for
us to carry on.” He warned Menzies
that “the people of this country will
wreak their vengeance on you at the
earliest opportunity.” Duggan (Q.) was
“shocked, surprised, disappointed and
amazed” and Hawke (W.A.) found the
offer “insulting and contemptible.” Play-
ford (S.A.\ and Fagan (Tas.) asked for
the figure to be reconsidered. When the
Commonwealth refused to budge from
the offer of £142 million,, Heffron said
the grant was “the most pitiful handout”
since the introduction of uniform taxa-
tion, and that it would “make it
inevitable for the States to complete the
financial year with deficits and perhaps
send some of them into bankruptcy.”
The Years Roll On
'T'hese comments are quoted at length
because they are typical of remarks
made year after year at these conferences.
It should be noted that when the finan-
cial year 1953-54 had dragged out its
course unemployment was lower than it
had been at the beginning ; no State had
been declared bankrupt; all but one
showed a Budget surplus for the year.
This, however, did not prevent a repeti-
tion of the same doleful talk year after
year. --
Every year the Premiers ask for a
thumping rise in tax-reimbursements;
every year they are given a modest rise
and go home muttering about bankruptcy.
Every year they ask for loan-money far
and away above the previous year’s allo-
cation ; every year they eventually settle
for a much smaller amount.
Last week they were at .it again. The
loan-allocations for the past three years
have been £l9O million; £192 million;
£2OO million. Tax-reimbursements for the
same period have been £157 million;
£174 million ; £l9O million. The current,
year’s loan-money was supplemented last
February by a special grant of £5 million
on the score of rising unemployment.
When the Premiers met last week they
sought a total loan-handout of £259 mil-
lion, although it must have been obvious
to them that no more than a slight
increase on the current year’s figure could
be expected or justified. They were well
aware that it is many years since the total
“loan” figure fixed at Loan Council meet-
ings was actually met by loan-money*
and that every year a considerable gap
has to be filled out of Federal revenue ;
also that Federal works have for a long
time been financed entirely out of revenue.
Between 1951-52, when the Common-
wealth first provided special assistance to
the Loan Council borrowing programme,
and 1956-57 the total amount so provided
was £458,682,000. Although this financing
of works from revenue has been criticised,
it is difficult to see what other course
could have been followed. In the con-
ditions that have prevailed in the last
decade, criticism can be levelled only at
the amount so spent or on details of the
spending, not at the practice itself, which
has undoubtedly been a factor in con-
trolling inflation.
Faith and Works
A cting-Premier lleffron, in asking for
£BB million last Wednesday, said,
“Let us face up to our responsibilities and
support allocations commensurate with
our faith in the future of Australia.” As
a piece of rhetoric that is all very well,
but in practice a balance has to be
struck between the kind of faith that is
merely Micawberish hope and the kind
that can be justified by probabilities.
The loan - market this year yielded
£103,100,000 ; the rest of the Loan Coun-
cil vote had to be found by the Common-
wealth Government. By all the indica-
tions no better result can be expected in
the coming year. If anything, the pros-
pects are worse instead of better; the
overseas loan-market is expected to be
harder to tap; existing foreign loans
amounting to £3OO million will be coming
up for redemption; export income is
down and drought and other factors will
militate against large domestic loan-
raisings. : ■
On the face of it the probabilities are
that the Commonwealth will have to dig
deeper into its pocket this year even to
finance a loan-programme of the same
dimensions as last year, so that any
increase in the allocation can only come
from the same source.
It was probably the recognition of the
inevitability of all this that moved the
Premiers to vote for the exclusion of the
press from their tax-reimbursement dis-
cussions last week—the first time the
talks have been conducted behind locked
doors. Much of the fulminating that has
been indulged-in in other years has been
intended for the electorate and caucus
rather than for the Prime Minister and
the Federal Treasurer.
The upshot of the private discussions
was that the Premiers accepted the Com-
monwealth's assurance that £205 million
must be regarded as the most the tax-
pool could y ield them, though they made
no rash promises in respect to his request
that they should refrain “unless the most
exceptional circumstances arise” from
asking for further assistance during the
year. Sitting as a Loan Council, the
Premiers also agreed to accept the Com-
monwealth’s figure of £2lO million as
the loan-funds limit for 1958-59. Having
asked for more, they naturally could not
express themselves publicly as being
delighted at the result, but both amounts
are probably very close to what they
privately reckoned on getting.

Stradbroke and Cup
Since 1953 the seven-furlongs
Q.T.C. Stradbroke Handicap
(worth £lO,OOO this year) has
been won by Sydney-trained
horses, and once more Bris-
bane’s chance of retaining the
big prize doesn’t look very
bright. Record time for ‘the
sprint is Kingster’s 1.23}, run
last winter. Doncaster winner
Grenoble has gone along the
right way since that success, and
is a firm favorite at time of
writing. Grenoble doesn’t
usually do much in the way of
fast trackwork, but he can
gallop as brilliantly as the best
of them at Rosebery when his
trainer sends him against the
watch.

Caranna, Baystone is in win-
ning form. Worth remember-
ing, too, that Caranna ran
second to Redcraze in the 1956
Brisbane Cup. The Cup dates

No closer than ninth at three
prior outings, in two of which
he started at 200 to 1, Fireroc
won Saturday’s Rosehill
Maiden for two-year-old coifs
and geldings at 50 to 1 (in-
places you could get better).
He defeated the well-fancied
Point Row and Pages. Fireroc
is by Persian Book (imp.) from
Penelgen—the dam was got by
Pentheus from Elgany by Sun
Cure (imp.) from Lin Queen
by Linacre (imp.). Some Cure,
winner of several Queensland
races, figures in the pedigree.
Breeder of thoroughbreds
M. Point wasn’t satisfied with
some of the prices offered for
his yearlings by Royal Empire
(Fr.) at the Randwick auction
last year and passed them in
for private treaty. 1 The list
included the filly Morning
Gleam, fqr whom the. highest
bid was 120gns. (At the last
Easter sales her yearling
brother also was passed in, at
50gns. ; he was offered on
behalf of Mrs. R. Coward, of
Woodstock, N.S.W.) Point
leased Morning Gleam until
June next to Mrs. R. C. Stuart,
wife of the filly’s trainer, and

Astronomer’s last three starts
have yielded two wins and a
third, the wins being at Canter-
bury and at Rosehill. Three
days before his Rosehill success
in the Second Parramatta
Stakes he had finished third to
Short Stop at Warwick Farm.
He opened at 6 to 4 for the
Rosehill sprint, but eased to
5 to 2 when strong support
came for Permel and Wil-
cumian. Had the latter won he
would have lifted a fortune
from the ringmen; he was
backed from 20 to 1 to 5 to 1.
Astronomer, who ran home an
easy winner, is a three-year-old
colt by Star Kingdom (imp.)
from Evangeline, and cost
2200gns. at the Randwick
yearling sales in 1956.

One of the Rosehill winners,
Golden Falcon, comes from
a family of winners. The
chestnut gelding, by Golden
Hackle (imp.) from Blonde
Glory, is raced by his breeders,
W. L. and R. B. Forsyth, of
Cootamundra (N.S.W.), and
trained at Randwick by Reg
Harris. Bought for 300gns.,
Blonde Glory is by Sion from
Golden Glory by Backwood
(imp.) and is now close on 20
years old. Her progeny have
included Braestand and Blond
Val (the latter won about
£20,000 in stakes). A few odd
bets were noted on Golden
Falcon at 100 to 1. He started
at 25’s.
Winner of a Maiden at New-
castle on Saturday, Real George
(one of R. L. Cashman’s) is
a three-year-old gelding by
Hua from Undine by Beau
Vite, and is closely related to
Silver Hawk, winner of the
Rosehill Guineas, and to
Iroquois, winner of many races
on Sydney tracks.
As the name implies, Grey
Ghost is a grey—and a pretty
good horse. He’s also been
taken around a fair bit, and
the ghost often walks, more or
less, where he’s been. For he’s
won each of his last five starts
—though the longest starting-
price against him was 5 to 2
at Caulfield last November.
At last week’s Warwick Farm
midweek fixture he started
second-favorite at 6 to 4 for
the Oatley Handicap and
defeated outsider Miss Oriel
and the favorite, High Spot.
Grey Ghost is a three-year-old
gelding by Empyrean (imp.)
from Tetrinia.
Ken Ranger, who. recently
retired as a Sydney paddock
bookmaker, bred Teeny’s Pet,
winner of Gosford Club’s
Three-year-old Maiden, in
which she was capably
handled by veteran jockey Roy
James. The filly is by Stockade
(imp.) from Florida by Mani-
toba (imp.) from Dinah Lee by
Heroic. She was reared at
Kia-Ora Stud, Scone, but
wasn’t' offered as a yearling,
though her breeding - lines
appeared in the Randwick
catalogue.
Country horses continue to
win in the slack season at
Sydney meetings. Go Bragh,
trained by R. J. Paton, beat
Stirling Girl, trained by his
brother, J. D. Paton, in the
Warwick Farm Lugarno
Stakes, and later in the after-
noon Projet, another of J. D,
Paton’s gallopers, narrowly
won the final event, the Narwee
Handicap. The Patons are no
strangers to city tracks, where
they have had their share of
success.

The S.T.C.’s banning of
bookmakers from midweek
meetings at Canterbury Park
for a trial period from January

topic in Turf circles in
Sydney, and in other parts of
Australia as well. The ban
may not be merely for a few
months ; it could be perman-

S.T.C. is chasing more revenue,
and with all midweek betting
through the tote it expects to
be able to add considerably to
prizemoney, which will please
owners, and to improve ameni-
ties for racegoers also. As the
S.T.C. chairman, Harry Tan-

ing the S.T.C. chief’s figures.
Culmination of an exciting
Turf week in Sydney was a
joint decision by the A.J.C.
and the S.T.C. to abolish jack-
pot betting after June 28 (if the
pool isn’t won that day—a
Warwick Farm fixture —it will
be continued until it is). Most
racegoers hope there will be
no more of these fantastic

In winning the English Derby
at 18 to 1 the oddly-named
Hard Ridden gave Sir Victor
Sassoon his third success in
the great classic. The colt had
a runaway success in defeating
Paddy’s Point (100 to 1) and
Nagami (10 to 1). Both the
winner and the runner-up are
Irish-bred, and it was the first
success by an Irish horse in
half-a-century. The winner
cost a mere 270gns. as a yearl-
ing. Veteran jockey Charlie
Smirke (he’s 51) had the win-
ning mount.

With the National meetings
just a month ahead, racegoers
at Moonee Valley last Satur-
day took a keen interest in the
two jumping events —but form
at the circular Valley track
can be deceptive, taken as a
guide to a horse’s chance at
Flemington, and probably the
best National run at the Valley
was that of a beaten horse.
Arabil, having his first run
since March, finished a
courageous second to Theadon
in the Port Phillip Hurdle. One
of Melbourne’s best hurdlers
over the last couple of seasons,
Arabil carried a good horse’s
weight—ll.lo—and conceded
the winner 271 b. Theadon is
obviously a more-than-useful
hurdler; prior to Saturday’s
win he had scored three times
in a row on country tracks ;
but he gave the impression
that the National distance
would probably be a bit
beyond him.
• • » v ,
There was no guide to the
National in the form shown in
the F. E. Shillabeer Steeple-
chase at the Valley. Van Perri
won the race in a canter. The
nine-year-old Perricoota geld-
ing seems to be able to lump
any weight to victory at the
Valley. On Saturday he carried
12.4, and won with a lot in
hand. He has been a wonder-
ful money-spinner for trans-
port man Reg Ansett. All told,
he has won 17 times, and 12 of
those wins have been at the
Valley. His stake-earnings are
now £13,975; this total is all
the more remarkable when it
is remembered that Van Perri
lacks the stamina to win an
important race—he will not
contest the National. None of
the horses that finished behind
'him last Saturday impressed as
a National prospect.

Over the last few years Aus-
tralian horses have done very
well in Singapore and round
about! Malaya, and another
that should pay his way up
there is Turrong, winner of
the first Tambo Welter at the
Valley; he was only recently
bought by Melbourne business-
man Gordon Skuce to be raced
at Singapore. Skuce allowed
Turrong to meet his engage-
ments at Pakenham last Thurs-
day and at the Valley on Satur-
day, and the four-year-old
gelding by Great Britain won
both races comfortably.
The extraordinary recent run
of success by two-year-old
favorites at Moonee Valley was
continued on Saturday. In the
mile Ovens Handicap first-
choice Minapre was untroubled
to score his first win. At his
previous three starts, in better
company, he had run minor
placings. A chestnut gelding by
Dhoti from Riviera, he’s a
full brother to useful galloper
Tingara, and trainer Stan
Boyden has classic hopes for
him. However, Minapre is
an unusually small gelding, and
he would need to improve a
great deal to be rated a Derby
chance.
In the Valley’s 13-furlongs
Goulburn Handicap the three-
year-old Comic Court gelding
Gazette proved much too good
for the older stayers. It was
noted here after Gazette’s
previous win that he seems to
have inherited his sire’s stamina
and will-to-win. He has the
blood-lines to prove better'than
the average winter galloper.
His dam, Roma, was by Helles-
pont from Comedy Wind from
Light Comedy by Comedy
King.
Most of the progeny of
successful N.Z. sire Count
Rendered are strong, good-
looking animals ; indeed Syn-
tax, by that sire, is as hand-
some a horse as one could
hope to see. And yet Double
Entry, a four-year-old mare by
Count Rendered from Bride-
cloth by Balloch, is„afl under-
sized, plain brown mare. She
knows how to gallop, though,
and has won four times from
nine Australian starts. Her
success in the Second Tambo
Welter at the Valley was a
particularly good perform-
ance. She missed the start in
that six-furlongs-lera-20yds.
event, lost the advantage of
her good barrier position and
had to go around everything
in the field; and then she won
running away. Double Entry
has done most of her racing
on country tracks, but she is
well up to winter form in the
city.

The Stockwell Stud at
Digger’s Rest (Vic.) has pur-
chased the top-class English
racehorse Arctic Explorer for
£45,000. A four-year-old,
Arctic Explorer is a direct
descendant ’ of the famous
mare Pretty Polly. Last season
he raced six times for four
wins, including the l£-miie
King Edward VII Stakes and
the 10-furlongs Eclipse Stakes.
Stockwell, incidentally, is also
the home of Landau, formerly
raced by the Queen.

The Trots
Driver A. G. Harpley had
a narrow escape from serious
injury in the First Qualifying
Stakes at Friday night’s Harold
Park meeting. He was driving
Tropical, a smart country per-
former having his first run at
Harold Park, when, shortly
after the start, the shafts of
the gig broke, and driver and
gig were a tangled mass being
dragged along only by the
reins. Eventually the horse
pulled clear. The race was
won by 5-to-4-on favorite First
Kiss.

In the Second Qualifying
Stakes John Leslie fell to his
knees at the start, and after
trailing the field for a lap was
pulled-up. Breezaire won from
Merrigal Joe, the pair return-
ing a quinella dividend of
£l6l ss.

Melbourne three-year-old
pacer Dusty Miller landed a
heavy betting-plunge in the
ISi-furlongs Schofields Handi-
cap. Backed from 2 to 1 to
6 to 4 on, he scored by two
. lengths from Pamboli. Dusty
Miller and another Victorian,
Maestro’s Melody (who broke
badly at the start of the Wind-
sor Handicap on Friday), have
between them won six races at
Harold Park in the last four
weeks.
Racing well, after two wins
and two seconds from her last
four starts, Highland Jan
(fourth winning favorite in
six races) landed the Harold
Park Handicap by a length
and a half from Andi, with
the evergreen Victory Dale
again in third place, which
possie he’d filled in the
two previous Harold Park
Handicaps.

Rugby League footbrawl:
England versus either N.S.W.' or
Australia at Rugby League is
usually a torrid affair; and Eng-
land v. N.S.W. at the S.C.G. on
Saturday was no exception. It
almost developed into a repeat-
performance of the second
England-r.-N.S.W. game in 1954,
which had to be called-off by
referee Oxford after it had become
an all-in brawl.
Four men were sent off by ref.
Pearce on Saturday. First to go,
after lOmin. in the second half,
was English lock Karalius, for
allegedly - kicking winger Dimond.
Actually Dimond had made a late
tackle and held on to Karalius,
which is extenuating circumstances
to a degree; still, the Lithuanian-
born Englishman had got away with
one or two things earlier. Dimond
himself was to be the fourth man
sent off, after N.S.W. second-row
forward Mossop (who had played
very well) and five-eighth Hawick
had also had marching orders.
(It doesn’t by any means neces-
sarily follow from this proportion
that N.S.W. was three times as
W'icked as England.)
In between all the brawling there
was some crowd-pleasing Rugby
(the crowd, incidentally, just on
53,000). England began at a
rattling pace; but N.S.W.’s defence
held firm. While English kickers
Fraser and Ashton missed four
penalties between them before
Fraser began to kick straight,
N.S.W. fullback Clifford put four
through the posts, for an 8-0 lead
to N.S.W. Two-minutes before
half-time English left-winger Sulli-
van raced "in to score a good try
after skipper Prescott (an inspiring
leader) and half-back Murphy had
broken through. England, 9-8 at
half-time.
After 7min. of the second half
Clifford goaled again, to put
N.S.W. ahead 10-9 with both sides

Test, at the S.C.G. on Saturday.
“Selja”: I nominate 34-year-
old Rugby League hooker Ken
Kearney as the oldest player
still playing first-class Rugby
football in Australia. Kearney
was a member of the 1947-48
Rugby Union Wallabies, played
League for a few seasons in
England, and has been a
regular member of N.S.W. and
Australian League teams for
several years. He has led and

In Sydney’s Rugby Union on
Saturday, Gordon, with
Wallaby skipper Bob Davidson
(who is to lead Australia in
the first Test against the.
Maoris) playing his 150th first-
grade game, just got there
against St. George, 9-6 ; one of
St. Geftrge kicker Crealy's
attempts at a penalty was dis-
allowed, though it looked
as if it went through.
Manly, now level on top
with St. George, outclassed
East, all of whose points
came from the reliable boot
of Bruce Galeo,l9-9 ; wooden-
spooner Drummoyne surprised
Randwick, 23-11 ; North beat
a weary University, fresh (if
that’s the word) from its victory
in the inter-’Varsity carnival in
Brisbane, 20-11 ; and Parra-
matta defeated Eastwood,
14-3.
In a close, hard-fought game
at Newcastle the Maoris
defeated Newcastle, 20-13. The
previous Wednesday, under
floodlights in Sydney, they had
thrashed the Barbarians, 38-8.
The Maoris meet Australia in
the first Test in Brisbane on
Saturday.

Very poor kicking for goal
marked some of the games in
Saturday’s V.F.L. round. In
perhaps the best game of the
day Melbourne beat South
down at South 16.12-11.10;
Collingwood stayed in second
place on the table, one win
behind Melbourne, by out-
playing St. Kilda 12.23-5.9;
Fitzroy, badly astray in front
of goal, wasn’t that much
superior to Geelong, also
atrociously off-target, 8.18-
6.15 ; North, earlier written-
off but now level on match-
points with Hawthorn (back
in “the four”) and St. Kilda,
defeated Richmond in the
Tigers’ own lair, 14.10-12.11 ;
Carlton scraped-in by a point
against Essendon, 7.8-5.19 —
the Dons, too, kicked atroci-
ously ; and Hawthorn made
amendis for its two successive
defeats beforehand by heading
Footscray 11.14-8.10.
“Rossby”: Perhaps the most
versatile V.F.L. footballer
today is South Melbourne fire-
man Fred Goldsmith, winner
of the 1955 Brownlow medal.
He won the Brownlow as a
full-back, but since then South
has also been using him as
full-forward. In fact, in one
or two games in 1957 he was
expected to kick goals with the
wind, then stop them when
South ran against it —which
is asking a lot, even of a
champion. Last season Gold-
smith also played a game for
Victoria as full-forward and
another game as full-back. This
year South started him in front
ENDEAN
of goal, but, a marked weak-
ness in defence showing-up,
he's now back in his old job, as
goalkeeper.
“Bicky”: Tony Ongarello,
Fitzroy star full-forward, is
the only V.F.L. player today
who ever uses the place-kick
when shooting for goal.
Although a time-waster, this
was once considered the safest
and most accurate way a goal-
sneak could kick for goal, and
was often used by “Dickie”
Lee and other great forwards
of bygone days. Tony has
only used the place-kick about
a dozen times, and has goaled
in half of the number.

At Compton, California, last
Friday Herb Elliott ran his
fifth under-4min. mile in his
last six races (all of which he
has won) when he very easily
defeated Tabori and Delany,
winner of the 1500-metres at
the 1956 Olympic Games.
Elliott’s time was 3.58.1. In
another mile-race, at Van-
couver on Saturday, English-
man Derek Ibbotson just
pipped Merv Lincoln in a
“photo-finish.” Third came
another Australian, Alex
Henderson, now studying in
U.S.A. Jbbotson’s time, 4min.

“Zorok”: The return fight
between Darby Brown and
Joe N'Gidi was won by the
Zulu, after both men had
been on the canvas twice and
only the bell saved N’Gidi one
time. Vic Patrick’s decision
was almost universally con-
demned, as had been his
decision, to Brown, in their
first fight. The pair may meet
yet again, and may each shortly
fight George Barnes, with a
shot at Johnny Van Rensburg’s
Empire welter title in the
offing for the best of the trio.
National welter champion
Billy Todd seems to be right
out of the reckoning.
* * *
“Ailsey”: Few Australians
have won two bowls titles
on the one day—but Royce
Lowe, of Lithgow (N.S.W.),
has now done it. In the
morning he won the N.S.W.
country championship by
defeating Bryce Lindsay
(Kurri) 31-22 ; in the afternoon
he accounted for Neville Green
(City) 31-25 in the N.S.W.
final. Green earlier had won
the metropolitan (Sydney)
championship by defeating Ern
Florence (North Sydney) 31-29.
Lowe’s club (Lithgov) has
produced some first-class
players, foremost of whom is
Dave Downie (now City,
Newcastle), who has won five
Australian or N.S.W. titles.
Lowe, who is 47, has been
playing nine years, but before
he won the N.S.W. title he
had not qualified for cham-
pionship week.

“Bicky”: The unique
'swimming-pool that was built
in Melbourne for the 1956
Olympic swimming and diving
events has since been put to
varied uses. Apart from
swimming-carnivals, it has on
occasions been drained and
used for symphony-concerts,
band-recitals, a horticultural
show and professional-
wrestling contests. These
various activities bring m a
certain amount of revenue to
help maintain the place, but a
lot more money would roll-in
if the pool were also open to the
public for swimming during the
summer.

Russia, as well as Britain.
Don't know if any Australian

should have a chance if they
go.

Information Sought
I have lately been reading “The
Sea-Kings of Crete,” by Rev. James
Baikie, published in 1910. He men-
tions that the Minoan scripts have
not been deciphered. Is it still a
mystery ?
No, the Minoan script known as
“Linear B” (there were stages of
writing in Crete—hieroglyphic,
“Linear A” and “Linear B”) has
now been deciphered, mainly
through the work of an English
architect, Michael Ventris. Two
American scholars, Dr. Alice
Kober and Emmett L. Bennett Jr.,
also helped considerably. As a
13-year-old schoolboy, in 1935,
Ventris attended a lecture given
by the then 83-year-old Sir Arthur
Evans, the archaeological discoverer
of ancient Crete. Making the
deciphering of the scripts his hobby,
Ventris, 17 years later, in 1952,
solved “Linear B,” the commonest
script. One of the great difficulties
confronting him was that there
was no bilingual clue available like
the famous Rosetta Stone. “Linear
A” * and the hieroglyphs are still
undeciphered. (Information from
Leonard Cottrell’s The Bull of
Minos.)

(1) Why has Condy's-crystals
( permanganate-of-potash ) been for
so long regarded as an antidote
for snakebite ? (2) Diet-experts
reject refined sugar as an item of
nourishment. Why ?
(I) This treatment seems to have
originated in India about 50 years
ago and spread all over the world
—without regard to the various
types of snakes and their poisons.
The Indian method was to make
deep incisions in the bite and inject
a very hot solution of Condy’s:
while the effect of the poison was
countered, healing was greatly
delayed. The process has been dis-
carded, and the crystals are no
longer trusted; only reliable anti-
dotes are those prepared in the
serum laboratories, and they must
be used quickly. Incision, ligatures
following bleeding, and early medi-
cal treatment are standard first-aid
treatment. (2) Refining-processes
remove many of the essential
vitamins. With a good mixed diet
containing vegetables and some
uncooked fruits there is no need
for concern.

Explanation of the Parliamentary
procedure of moving the adjourn-
ment of the House to discuss a
definite matter of urgent public
importance?
The following reply is based on
information supplied by A. T.
Tregear, Clerk of the House of
Representatives:
This procedure was introduced
into the rules of the U.K. House
of Commons on November 27,
1882. It was evolved as a means
of countering interference with
business caused by dilatory
motions for the adjournment of
the House—during the 19th century
this practice was overemployed and
tended to upset Parliament’s daily
routine. Any member who was
not satisfied with an answer could
begin a debate, but as no debate
could take place except upon a
question put from the Chair, the
member would, to conform, pro-
pose to move the adjournment of
the House. This practice was open
h” L°" S fl abe^ abUSe ’„7 giea r
l ‘ to tbe regularity ot
ousiness.
Rather than eliminate the prac-
tice, it was felt that provision could
be made for its use in certain
restricted circumstances. So, today,
in the standing-order, a member
may submit his motion to the
House before the normal business
of the day is called on; it must be
a definite matter of urgent public
importance, and the member must
have the leave of the House or
the support of a specified number
of his fellows. Another rule is
that a written statement of the
A"nd Voomerah, Tovarisch Colonel? Ve vill ’oneymoon at Voomerah — yes ?”
matter proposed to be discussed
shall beforehand be submitted to
the Speaker, who will decide
whether it complies with the pro-
visions of the standing order. Not
more than one such motion can
be made during the same sitting
of the House.
The procedure has been adopted
by the Parliaments of the various
Commonwealth countries, including
the Australian Commonwealth and
State Parliaments. In all cases the
basic principle is common, but
variation occurs in matters of
detail —e.g., time within which the
written statement should be sub-
mitted to the Speaker (or other
presiding member); extent of sup-
port required from other members;
part of sitting during which debate
•should occur; particular form of
motion to be moved; time-limits
for individual speeches; overall
length of debate, and means of
disposal of motion.
Statements proposed for discus-
sion should be submitted in writing
to the Speaker. A . variation of
some interest took effect in the
Australian House of Reps, when
the relevant standing-order was
amended in 1952. In that House a
member does not now move any
motion, but instead merely pro-
poses that a matter should be sub-
mitted for discussion. This change
derives from the contention by a
former Speaker that the primary
purpose of the procedure is to
ensure discussion rather than to
obtain a decision on a purely
technical motion, ltjs also pro-
vided that when more than one
matter is presented for the same
day priority shall be given to the
one which, in the opinion of the
Speaker, is the most urgent and
important.
Adjournment is highly valued
t»y members, particularly those ot
Opposition; it represents the
on jy me thod whereby room can
be f ounc j j n t h e prearranged pro-
gramme to debate a matter of
sudden emergency. Upon the
motion to adjourn the House to
conclude the day’s sitting (usually
only moved by a Minister) it is
common practice to permit irrelevant
subjects to be raised for debate,

(1) How did art-unions begin ?
(2) Is the term an Australian one?
(1) The Australian Encyclopedia
describes the art-union as “a type
of lottery probably introduced into
Australia in the early part of the
19th century.” It records that “an
early record in point appeared in
the Sydney ‘Herald’ on December
15, 1841, when subscribers to ‘Mr.
Felton’s Art Union’ who had not
paid their subscriptions were
‘respectfully requested’ to do so
without delay; distribution of the
prize paintings would take place
immediately after the subscriptions
were received. Originally, con-
ductors of an art-union commis-
sioned or bought works of art,
numbered tickets were sold to a
group or ‘union’ of people and
the paintings or art-pieces were
distributed by lot among the ticket-
holders. An art-union was, in fact,
a means by which works of art
were disposed of ” (2) Appar-
ently they began in France and
Germany early in the 19th century.
The first in Britain was established
in Edinburgh; the Art-union of
London was founded on February

Future
Attraction of capital investment from abroad
is prominent in our national planning now, and I
think we should try to understand what this means
to us in terms of a balanced future.
I agree that Australia should be doing
everything possible to win investment for the
building of its industrial strength. The more diverse
and work-providing our manufacturers, the stabler
our home markets will be for produce from the
land. And we should also be alive to the trends that
show in the rural economies of other countries.
I have in mind particularly what is happening
in the United States of America, a country about
equal in area to our own. In less than twenty years
the number of farm residents of the U.S.A. has
dropped from twenty-three per cent, to twelve per
cent, of the population. Last year nearly two
million Americans moved from farms to towns
and cities.
Yet—and this is the important point—the
U.S.A. is producing from its farms more than ever
before. The fewer farmers are working larger
individual areas.
This has been brought about by increased
mechanisation, greater application of science to the
land industries, and the spread of education in
better farming practices.
For ourselves, of course, there are conditioning
sides to this dramatic example: Australia is younger
and sparser in settlement; its present population is
heavily weighted to the cities; over ninety per cent,
of American farms have electrical power for their
off-field operations, and so, with mechanical
equipment in the field, have the way wide open to
them in labour-saving.
But the central fact prevails, and I believe it
should profit us now: A country which uses
intelligently the modern means of sustaining and
increasing its wealth from the land can afford to
invite more industries, absorb a larger population,
and have available more in manpower for its overall
industrial advancement.
In other words, it maintains its balance—and
that, as we know, is a governing principle in forward
movement.

France and De Gaulle
■Oeport on de Gaulle by
_ “Diogenes” in London
“Time and Tide”:
“I have watched de Gaulle
for many years in the
days when he tried to pull
France together, and in the
years of his despairing retreat
from the corrupt Parisian
scene. I am quite sure that he
is not a Fascist. I do not think
he wants a Fascist Govern-
ment. I think he wants a
Government. Just that! A
Government with some
prospect of holding office for
more than a couple of months
at a time! A Government with
some sure backing in the
Chamber of Deputies. A
Government capable of apply-
ing and carrying through a con-

tinuing policy. A Govern-
ment not at the mercy of every
new conspiracy of the epigones.
A Government with some of
the responsibility of an
American or British Govern-
ment. And I agree with him.
It is time to pull down the
curtain on the tragic farce of
the last 12 years. It might be
said to the French Deputies,
as Cromwell said to one of his
Parliaments: ‘You have sat
here too long for any good
that you have done or are
likely to do! Get you gone!’
“It will be said, of course,
that de Gaulle is the tool of the
Algerian ‘lobby.’ If that lobby
thinks so, it is backing a bad
bet. De Gaulle, in my reading
of him, will be no man’s fool.
If the power should be given
him, he will first put the Con-
stitution in some sensible shape,
and then address himself to the
Algerian problem. And. judg-
ing by the support that the
Algerian Public Safety Com-
mittee is getting from Arab
sources, I should not be at all
surprised to see de Gaulle pulh
off a settlement completely
unobtainable by the epigones
in Paris today. (‘Epigones’—
by the way—is a word which
denotes the now - dwarfed
descendants of once great
men.)
“I do not presume the out-
come of the French upheaval,
but of one thing I feel sure.
Reality has obtruded into the
world of make-believe and
sham. To me, the air feels
cleaner and more breathable
because of that.”
Cyprus
“For” and “Against” the
invitation by Dr. Fisher, Arch*
bishop of Canterbury, to
Archbishop Makarios to attend
the Lambeth Conference:
London “Daily Express”:
“By inviting Archbishop Mak-
arios to London to a church
conference the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Dr. Fisher, gravely
embarrasses the Cabinet.
Hitherto the Government has
resolutely refused to treat
with Makarios until he has
denounced terrorism in Cyprus.
Dr. Fisher’s opposition to that
stand is well known, and as a
member of the House of Lords
he is entitled to express it.
“But it is monstrous that
he should abuse his position
as spiritual leader of the
Church of England and thus
bring pressure to bear on the
Government during the vital
weeks before it makes a
decision.’!
* * #
London “News Chronicle” :
“Had Makarios been left out
of the list of invitations to the
Lambeth Conference, then all
the Orthodox Churches would
have regarded this as a slight.
Mr. Lennox-Boyd may well
take advantage of the Arch-
bishop’s presence to have talks
with him. He will be right to
do so. It would upset Tory
back-benchers, but no settle-
ment of the Cyprus problem
can be reached without Arch-
bishop Makarios’s agreement.
This settlement is a matter for
the Government. A Lambeth
Conference is Dr. Fisher’s
affair and it is for the church
conference that Makarios has
been invited.”
# * *
Edinburgh “Scotsman”: “In
April, 1956, Dr. Fisher was of
opinion that Makarios, in
appearing to condone violence,
had put himself very much in
ti e wrong, but he added that
in Cyprus Makarios ‘would be
judged as a churchman, doing
what it is proper—whatever
the Canon Law may say—for
a churchman to do.’ As Dr.
Fisher nevertheless wanted the
British Government to recog-
nise that whatever Makarios’s
political activities he
remained the head of an inde-
pendent church, a religious
and a Christian leader whose
presence was indispensable to
the proper functioning of that
church, it is clear that he had
to ask him to Lambeth.”
* * *
Earl Winterton, in a letter
to London ‘'Daily Telegraph”:
“This man [Makarios] was
expelled from Cyprus and sub-
sequently interned because he
was the leader of an unconsti-
tutional action against the legal
Government of Cyprus. It was
stated officially at the time of
. his deportation that he was
suspected of contriving or par-
ticipating in terrorist activities ;
since he was not brought to
court 1 do not know whether
or not this charge can be
sustained.
“What is certain is that, pos-
sessing an influence similar to
that of a dictator over the
Greek Cypriots, he has never
once condemned the murder of
British soldiers, Cypriot police
and civilians by terrorists,
which he could have ended if
he wished.
“He has thus incurred a ter-
rible moral responsibility. No
doubt in the next debate on
foreign affairs in this House
[Lords] more than one peer will
want to know why he has been
invited to the conference.
“It will be no answer to say
that he has recently visited the
United States and has been
treated by some sections there
as an honored guest, or that he
has already been consulted
informally by representatives
of the British Government and
may be brought into more
formal consultation over the
future of Cyprus if and when
a settlement is in sight.
“What will be sought from
whoever speaks for the Episco-
pal bench in the debate is an
answer to the question how
the cause either of Christianity
or the Anglican community
can be advanced by inviting a
man with such a record to
participate in the Lambeth
Conference.”

“Yorkshire Post” : “The Bri-
tish Government's view is that
this is an ecclesiastical affair
which does not concern them.
They are probably embar-
rassed, but they are helpless
since Archbishop Makarios is
free to go where he will outside
Cyprus. But there is a third
party whose feelings are
entitled to expression and are
not to be whittled down to
niceties of protocol: that is the
British public.
“There are men and women
in this island [Britain], as

of that other island in the

Art in Russia
Commenting on the visit of
the Moscow Arts Theatre to
London —“for sheer acting skill
and theatrical artistry this
Communist State-owned and
-administered company can
hold its own with, and perhaps
even outshine, anything pro-
duced by private enterprise in
the free world” London
“Daily Telegraph” suggests
that the company contradicts
“our [the West’s] complacent
assumption about freedom
being the very breath of all
art”:
“Here is a theatrical com-
pany, rigidly chained to the
wheel of Communist ortho-
doxy, whose every decision is
subject to the dictation of party
policy, triumphantly interpret-
ing the inspiration of classical
drama. Here are artists who

struments of political propa-
ganda, and are indeed so
regarded by the Soviet leaders,

theatre can prosper in even the
most tyrannical of States.
Sputnik shattered our illusions
about science and Com-
munism: clearly rigid political
orthodoxy does not stifle free
inquiry in the laboratory.
Apparently the same is also
true in the theatre.
“It would, of course, be
quite wrong to conclude from
this that our hatred and con-
tempt for Communism have
been misplaced. This, no
doubt, is what Mr. Khrushchev
would wish us to conclude, and
explains why he has authorised
the visit. The true conclusion,
which should be chastening and
salutary, is that during the
Stalinist era we grossly over-
simplified the nature of the
Communist challenge, confus-
ing a temporary caricature with
the real face of tyranny.
“The truth is that art and
science can flourish, and very
often have flourished, under the
worst of tyrannies. If the case
for Parliamentary democracy
and against Communism were
simply that sometimes culture
and science prospered in the
one and dried-up in the other,
it would rest on the quicksand
of historical accidents.
“Events like the Sputnik, and
the visit of the Moscow Arts
Theatre, which make it increas-
ingly difficult to dismiss Com-
munism as a mere primitive
barbarism, should force us to
think again about the basic
issues between the two parts
of the world. One thing is quite
certain: they are not as simple
as we like to assume.”
On another matter more-or-
less related to Soviet culture
New York “Herald Tribune”
expresses what is a common
complaint about the Soviet’s
non-observance of inter-
national copyright:
“Man’s efforts to foil the
literary pirate go back a long
way,” the “Herald Tribune”
comments. “One durable

give it back, saying: ‘For every

“It was another thousand
years before this concept was
enacted into Anglo-Saxon law,
under Henry VIII, and still
there were no bars to thievery

The Soviet Economy
Edinburgh “Scotsman” com-
ment on the Soviet “rule” of
“Jam tomorrow and jam yester-
day but never jam today”:
“The Soviet citizens under-
stand this logic, for they have
had to submit to it for years.
But Mr. Khrushchev is now
holding out hopes that jam may
be on the menu soon after all.
“There is word of a develop-
ment of the plastics industry
on a large scale in Russia.
Sputniks are all very well as
symbols of Russian pre-
eminence, but many a Russian
housewife is probably secretly
prepared to swap a sputnik or
two for a light plastic pail,
and even nylon socks for men
outweigh the wonders of space-
travel.
“In any case, if Russia is so
wonderful why should her
people be denied the simple
pleasures of the average
American? Mr. Khrushchev
has shown himself sensitive to
this comparison with the
United States, and has boasted
that Russia will yet outstrip
America in per capita- produc-
tion. He seems now to be
promising the Russian people
more consumer-goods.
“In itself this might be of
good augury for peace, because
a regime which concentrates on
consumer-goods for a time is
the less likely to be planning
for war. But it is impossible to
tell whether this peep into a
peaceful future has not been
vouchsafed to the Russian
people by Mr. Khrushchev so
that if the summit-talks are
either not held or prove un-
satisfying to Russia the blame
for a reversal of policy and a
renewal of the sacrifices to the
Moloch of heavy industry may
be the more readily placed on
the shoulders of the Western
nations.
“ ‘But for the capitalist and
imperialist nations,’ Mr.
Khrushchev may one day be
heard to say, ‘the Russian
people’s car would now be
on the road. Only the determ-
ination of Western countries to
maintain the cold war makes it
necessary for the Soviet citizen
to postpone the civilised
pleasures which Russian enter-
prise could provide.’ ”
The R.A.F.
British editorial comment
on conference “Prospect,” at
which the Air Staff, headed
by Sir Dermot Boyle,
attempted to “lobby” senior
officers of the services, M.P.s,
industrialists and trade-union
representatives:
“Yorkshire Post”: “In many
ways this was a remarkable
gathering. It seems to have
been designed to give wide
publicity to the R.A.F.’s point
ot view in defence matters, and
it left the impression in some
quarters that these views differ
materially from those of the
Defence Minister [Mr. Sandys],
especially on the future place
of manned bombers and
fighter-aircraft. It might be
argued that the R.A.F. repre-
sentatives were merely putting
forward aspects of their
activity. On the other hand,
lf there is a serious difference
on policy and the conference
was being used to mould public
opinion in favor of the ser-
vice chiefs, an important point
of principle is raised.
“It would be wholly against
British tradition to permit the
introduction of pressure-group
tactics in such a field. There
should be only one spokesman
for a Government department,
and that is the Minister. If
the executive head of a ser-
vice department does not see
eye-to-eye with Government
policy and there must be
occasions when this happens
he is in the position of a
manager of a big company at
loggerheads with his board.
Provided the issue is serious
enough, the only remedy is
for him to resign. Then he
is free to say what he likes
on a matter of public interest.”

Edinburgh “Scotsman”: “It
is true that secrecy about

side the Government 'cannot
discuss policy in the well-
informed way that is possible
in America. If the Air Coun-
cil’s conference were intended

about the prospects for the
R.A.F. it would be a praise-
worthy enterprise. But it
would be naive to divorce it
from the widespread belief that
Mr. Sandys and his profes-
sional advisers do not see eye-
to-eye about various matters,
especially the future of manned
aircraft. The last two defence
White Papers made it clear
that the Government expected
to replace manned bombers
and fighters with ballistic
missiles.
“Mr. Macmillan avers that
nothing said at the conference
conflicted with Government
policy. Yet the Chief of the
Air Staff is reported to have
stated the R.A.F. s view that
manned aircraft would be
needed as far ahead as they
could see. There is a conflict
of evidence and of interpreta-
tion, but the affair can hardly
be dismissed in an airy way
as speculation on improbable
contingencies.
“The Air Council should
advise Ministers, and leave
it to them and to other poli-
ticians to edify the public,
We do not want to have the
services campaigning for their
own policies, as they do in
America. Even if the affair
were as harmless as Mr. Mac-
millan implies it should teach
service chiefs the Consti-
tutional risks of publicity
ventures.”
* * *
London “Daily Telegraph”:
“The airmen, as so often in
the past, overstated the case
against the missile and the
case for the pilot. If missiles
were all going to the Army or
the Navy this would be under-
standable. But as most of
them will be with the R.A.F.
it sounds merely thoughtless—•
the thoughtlessness which gave
us a large surplus of obso-
lescent Hunters. The less said
now about ‘Prospect’ the
better. Everyone knew the
Whitehall volcano was active,
and the eruption has been
only slight. But it provides
fresh evidence that Ministers
and their advisers need
independent advice on some
of our defence problems from
a body which can see around
and above the special plead-
ings of Admiralty, War Office
and Air Ministry.”
* * *
London “Daily Mirror”:
“It is one thing for a Minister
and his experts to argue
behind closed doors. But it is
intolerable when the argument
becomes an open challenge to
the Minister in charge. In a
democracy, defence policy
must remain in the hands of
the Government and not in
the hands of service chiefs.”

the supremacy of the Ministry
of Defence, provided that such
supremacy does not prevent a
degree of operational inde-
pendence ; the Navy has
accepted cuts and a change in
the building-programme; the
Army has accepted a reduction
in strength and the disap-
pearance of famous regiments
through amalgamation; the
Air Force has virtually
admitted that the guided
missile is the ultimate ‘deter-
rent.’ These acceptances and
admissions are due less to
discipline than to recognition
of a new situation: but, when
it comes to details, real
differences will not simply dis-
appear in a praiseworthy effort
to maintain the united front.
“Further examination and
argument about details have
renewed doubts about the
Defence Minister’s whole view
of the future or rather about
the date at which that view
may be expected to correspond
with reality. Mr. Sandys has
really pinned his faith to the
theory.that there can bp no
minor war which will not
immediately turn into a major
war, and there is probably more
to be said for this than his
critics admit. If he is right,
defence-planning must be based
on the assumption that only a
major war will extend our
resources.
“But suppose he is not right:
There is legitimate ground for
believing that defence-planning
should take account of the
probability that a minor war
might be isolated or at least
take a long time to develop into
a major one. The Army’s
charge against Mr. Sandys is
that he is not making provision
for such a minor war. The
value of the ‘deterrent’ as now
conceived is questioned and the
view openly expressed that this
country must pay the cost of
a double preparation in case
the ‘deterrent’ fails to deter, or
in case war comes in such a
form that the pulling of the
trigger of the ‘deterrent’ would
be left to the democracies.
“Equally, the Air Force
fears that between now and
the date at which the ‘deterrent’
will be fully developed a
suspension of research and
construction might leave this
country in an inferior position
before the ‘deterrent.’ was ready
to deter. This is the crux of
the controversy about the
manned v. the unmanned
bomber, for, if the latter is to
be effective, costly research
and construction must go on.
There is the fear, too, that dis-
armament might disarm the
‘deterrent’ without providing
for really adequate disarma-
ment in other spheres.
“It is to the good that all this
should be argued out, but it
cannot be properly argued
without further statements by
the Minister of Defence. In the
absence of such statements
rumor has free rein. Only
one instance may be cited—the
rumor that Mr. Sandys con-
templates making Earl Mount-
batten the ‘supremo’ in a new
organisation which leaves all
power to his Ministry. This
rumor has caused unease far
beyond the higher service
circles. It would be wise if the
whole matter were cleared-up.”

Lord Russell: “It took 100

the thing more quickly.”

21/5/’5B) seems to me to have
little reference to reality so
far as it concerns N. S. Wales.
k have been a practising
solicitor for almost 50 years
and, having had considerable
experience in both Sydney and
“the bush,” feel I am com-
petent to state the facts and
form an opinion.
In the first place, Justices
of the Peace, whatever their
qualifications, do not exercise
jurisdiction in any contested
matter ; it is many years since
they did so. On very odd
occasions, in order to save
time, Justices (almost always
the local Clerk of Petty
Sessions included) do deal
with a few formal matters.
The stipendiary magistrates
who exercise jurisdiction in
the lower courts (Petty
Sessions, Fair Rent, minor
liquor matters and Small
Debts with jurisdiction to £5O)
are invariably public servants,
men who have graduated
from positions of C.P.S. ; all
are qualified by examinations,
many being solicitors or
barristers. They are qualified
by experience of many years
to do the work of magistrates,
On the other hand, judges
appointed from ranks of
barristers are not qualified by
experience to act as judges.
They find themselves suddenly
“on the opposite side of the
fence,” and far too many do
not adapt themselves to their
new positions but continue to
act as advocates on one side or
another on the cases which
come before them.
Thefe are, of course, far
more stipendiary magistrates
than District Court judges in
N. S. Wales, but in my experi-
ence more District Court judges
have been misfits than police-
magistrates or stipendiary
magistrates.
To adopt any alternative
system as suggested in your
article would be a retrograde
step. The present system
works well in the administra-
tion of justice.
There are, of course, delays
and congestion in the courts,
but these are not the result of
the system of appoint-
ment of stipendiary magistrates.

Hire-purchase
Is there a credit-manager in
the house?
By June 30 Australians will
be on the h.-p. cuff to the tune
of £3OO million for goods
worth £lOO. million. That
position is cockeyed by at least
£lOO million. The number of
finance-corporations now seek-
ing credit-managers is signifi-
cant. It is not that all
customers are now suspect.
These concerns are looking for
men able to assess the credit
and stability of the firm
employing the wage-earner who
is their customer, and to
determine the element of risk
in their ability to continue to
employ him.
This is much more complex
than checking to see if Mrs.
K’Foops is in any “black
books.” It calls for knowledge,
ability, discretion and tact.
Much of our production-
capacity is tied-up in the
highly competitive and there-
fore vulnerable field of
domestic-appliances.
A generation without
experience of depression or
even periods of belt-tightening
perhaps considers these items
essential to normal living, but
a sudden upsurge in the rate
6f repossession has convinced
many that the items came into
the home a little too easily.
The hire-purchase system is
here to stay. It is a decent-
sized vector in our money-
circulatory routine. Good
credit-management in all its
phases can do much to keep
the system equitably loaded.
The interest paid by the
finance people for their
borrowed money is much too
high if they are not prepared to
carry a proportion of the
temporarily bad risks.
Drastic and wholesale re-
possession can only damage
production and further aggra-
vate the present disturbed
conditions. Old Opencut

Yankee Migrants
Today there is an excellent
chance of a steady flow of
young Americans of the best
types being attracted to Aus-
tralia. . The pioneering era is
over in the U.S. No longer
are there extensive under-
developed regions that offer
easy opportunity to the
"Good Lord, Bill — that last big river We forded. ...”?
ambitious young fellow anxious
to be his own master.
This live-wire type of
American is likely to find
achievement of his ambitions
easier in a less industrialised
country like Australia than in
his homeland. For those
interested in the land and
possessed of moderate capital,
Australia also offers as good,
perhaps better, prospects.
And no better immigrants
could be secured. They repre-
sent some of the most enterpris-
ing elements from probably the
world’s most enterprising
middle-class. They speak the
same language as we do, have
similar ideals, and should fit
easily into our way of life.—
Cunedda (N.S.W.').
Weighted Scales
The inadequacies of our
courts to provide the means by
which every man may secure
justice are unluckily not con- -
fined to cases of summary
offences ,(B. 30/4/’5B). They
are apparent in almost every
aspect of our legal system: so
glaring are the anomalies that
it can no longer be asserted
that all men are equal in the
sight of the law.
There seem to be two main
reasons for this: the extent to
which Governments have
intruded upon our economic
and social activities, and the
existence of a whole series of
tribunals to which recourse
may be had by either of the
interested parties. While these
two causes have no intrinsic
relationship, their combined
effect is to render the cost of
obtaining justice prohibitive for
most of us.
In cases of litigation between
citizens with limited financial
resources, the court’s decision
is usually accepted, appeals to
a higher tribunal being costly.
But where the Crown is one
of the contending parties it
can, without worrying about
costs, keep appealing to higher
courts until its private-citizen
opponent is forced to drop out
or be made bankrupt."
In short, the scales of justice
are heavily weighted in favor
of the party with the longer
purse ; and when that party to
litigation happens to be the
Crown the other party might
as well pocket his pride at the
outset and save his money.
What can be done to remedy
this intolerable position, which
potentially affects us all?
Drastic curtailment of the
rights of appeal seems indicated.
As an alternative, provision
might well be made for the

Railway Finances
If, as has been claimed, trans-
port represents one-third of all
retail prices, it would seem
about time we dropped the
polite fiction about railway
“losses” and started facing-up
to realities. State railways are
not losing lots of money ; all
they are doing is divesting
themselves of some of the out-
side responsibilities they have
borne for so long ; and the
sooner this is appreciated the
better.
For a hundred years succes-
sive Governments have
borrowed money to build, equip
and re-equip their railways,
whereas none has ever taken
the unpopular course of rais-
ing rates sufficiently to repay
the loans. One result is that
the capital-value of the
N.S.W. railways now stands at
the absurdly-inflated figure of
£260 million, on which the
present Administration is
expected to earn capital-
charges. I doubt whether they
could do it if they operated
under ordinary commercial,
conditions, which the State
railways don’t and never have
done. Split the 6000-mile
N.S.W.R. into three equal
sections, and the first could
probably operate commercially
and make enough profit to
cover the second, which is
marginal; the remainder is
not a transport business at all,
but a direct form of assistance
to primary production, 1m
recognition of which the
Government makes a token
grant which bears no relation-
ship whatever to the operating
loss.
So long as the railways
enjoyed a monopoly these
commitments could be taken
in their stride, but with the rise
in competition (aimed naturally
at their more profitable traffic)
that ability fell into a decline
and the Section 92 verdict
merely provided the coup de
grace.
Short of a policy of repudi-
ation, those financial commit-
ments remain, and somebody
has got to meet them. Calling
them “railway” losses just
doesn’t get us anywhere.—-
Transporticus (Singapore).
Local Government
A second way in which the
N.S.W. Local Government
Act requires drastic re-amend-
ment (B. 28/5/’5B) is by the
re-insertion of the section
Cahill and Co. took out which-
provided for a poll of rate-
payers before certain classes of
loan could be negotiated. As
the ratepayers have to find the
money to repay these loans
they should be given the right
to say whether they agree or
not.
Thirdly, the matter of rural
rating should be clarified, and
what the department is pleased
to call “its rating structure”
thrown over the Gap or down
an abandoned mineshaft. At
present the department decides
whether public works shall be
paid for out of general-rate,
or a local one imposed to meet
their cost if in a town or
village. The system can operate
very harshly, and is open to
grave abuse, though it may
save the town- or shire-clerk a
little work. It should be
mandatory in the Act that
rural general-rates levied in a
shire cannot be more than,
50 p.c. of those levied in towns
or villages, and that any area in
excess of, say, five acres shall
be deemed to be a rural area
(and so subject to a reduced
general-rate) if it be used for
cultivation or grazing. This
provision already applies to
municipalities, and its exten-
sion to shires has become
urgent. A lot of us would like
to see Mr. Morton come out
with a clear and definite state-
ment on that aspect.
Fourthly, there is need for
a new section in the Act pro-
viding that except for roads,
bridges, water, gas- and elec-
tricity-supply no expenditure
in excess of, say, £lO,OOO be
incurred without prior
approval by the ratepayers,
expressed by a poll. This would
cramp the style of those
enthusiasts who want to dot
New South Wales with imita-
tions of the Sydney Town
Hall.
Fifthly, there should be pro-
vided in the Act a definite time-
limit for the person appointed
as administrator and he should
be specifically prevented by
law from committing the rate-
payers to any loan-expenditure
unless such expenditure has
been previously approved by a
committee of ratepayers,
which can be set up under the
present Act. This system
worked well in Bourke, where
a committee of five met regu-
larly right through 1953 and
1954. With their backing
(they were all solid men with
stakes in the community) a
comprehensive tree-planting
programme was embarked on
at a cost of £BOOO, and the
machinery set in motion to
amplify the water-supply,
Everybody was happy, so
happy that the two elections
ordered by the Minister (July
1952 and December 1953) were
washouts because insufficient
candidates offered, there being
one in 1952 and three in 1953.
The townspeople made no
secret of the fact that they were
more than satisfied with the
existing regime. Blit other
municipalities or shires have
not been nearly so happy, and
in at least one case an
administrator’s recall has been
demanded by a large public
meeting. In any case, it is
utterly repugnant to the
average Australian that a
departmental officer should


have the right at law to mort-
gage an area for perhaps several
hundred thousand pounds,
irrespective as to whether the
money will be wisely or ill-
spent, or even spent on some-
thing which the ratepayers
have said emphatically they
don’t want.
All these matters I believe
are basic to real local-govern-
ment, Their implementation
would pay handsome divi-
dends. Douglas Tilghman
(N.S.W.)
Diggers Who Stayed* Behind
Revisiting the battlefields in
1935 I met “Doc” Edwards
(Driver E. Edwards, 2nd Divi-
sion Motor Transport), who
stayed behind, married a made-
moiselle and kept an estaminet,
“La Lamartine,” in 'Amiens.
He had to evacuate Amiens
during World War II; he
returned to Australia with his
wife and they settled in Albury.
I understand both died there.
“Doc” was a good scout and
a friend of many Australian
tourists visiting the battlefield^.
Another who, I think, stayed
was C. A. Adams (generally
known as “Stiletto” Adams). I
was with him in the Wireless
Section of the Australian
Corps Signal Coy. in 1917. He
was very keen to learn French
and told me he intended to
stay in France after the war
and make his fortune taking
tourists around the battlefields.
He spent all his leave in vil-
lages behind the lines, stay-
ing with French families to
improve his knowledge of the
lingo.
In 1918 he was sent to the
French Army on liaison duty
and was wounded. I was sent
to relieve him at the French
Corps and well remember
how popular he was with' the
French troops. From the O.C.
down everyone regretted losing
Monsieur Adams. I lost trace
of “Stiletto” after he was
wounded, but I fancy he
recovered and stayed behind.
Anyone ever run into him
since? —H. J. Mclvor (Vic.).
W.P.B. Fodder
“D.1.M.”: Of wasted tax-
money, a fair swag of it is
tossed into the w.p.b.s under the
counters of small non-official
country post-offices. It was
at 'one of these I earned a
meagre crust until I decided I’d
like a little butter as Well.
At such offices almost every
day iarge envelopes arrive con-
taining notices of those things
that may or may not be done.
They are sent by the district-
inspectors, who know exactly
what business these offices do.
Ours sold stamps and postal-
notes, delivered and collected
letters and parcels, and
paid child - endowment.
Anything complicated, such as
parcels for abroad, was dis-
patched from the township.
There was no telephone-
exchange.
However, we received endless
memoranda regarding the pay-
ment of pensions, while just as
numerous were those dealing
with our non-existent telephone-
exchange, trunk-line calls, tele-
grams, etc.
Parcels to foreign countries
(things unknown in our office)
seemed to be a constant worry
to the higher-ups. They were
always telling us how to send
parcels to almost-unheard-of
places—those to St. Thome and
Principe were now 1 Is. for
31b., to Ascension and St.
Helena 6s. 6d. Gift-parcels to
Greece, I was told, were now
subject to customs-duty, while
insured parcels to Saudi-
Arabia must be sealed with
wax or lead-seals. Also, the
rates for radiograms to Outpost
Radio Stations, Lord Howe
Island and Willis Island had
been increased (well, natbrally).
One memorandum told me to
telegraph for extra income-tax
forms, if necessary. Another
inquired if it had been necessary
and for how many? It had not
been necessary.
A vast amount of cor-
respondence came regarding
football-pools, to be or not to
be.
Once a week I sent to the
town post-office for stamps
and postal-notes to replace
those sold—perhaps three or
four p.n.s and 10s. worth of
stamps. These arrived in a
thick brown envelope 14iin.
by 9|in. which, if bought from
a stationer, would cost over a
shilling each. My stamps, etc.,
I found hiding coyly in a
corner of these vast containers.
All these and hundreds of
equally useless items, which
made a beautiful bonfire every
few months, came from a
district-inspector who knew
exactly—or should have known
exactly—what business was
done there. I certainly filled in
enough returns and forms to
keep him informed. —D. I. M.

Wool
Have had a good deal to
do with wool, having mustered
it, hand-fed it, salvaged it
from the blow-fly, retrieved it,
protesting, from flood-water,
poddied it —all while it was
being worn by the original
inventor. Fve also washed,
ironed and mended the pro-
cessed article over the years,
and in my opinion “Tiddles”
(B. 21/5/’5B) is wrong in
claiming that it is “glamor and
attraction” that woollen cloths
need. Wool, in varying
weights, can be woven into
beautiful materials, taking dye
well, and retaining an
elasticity that is not found in
the synthetics ; it has a “body”
that the substitutes lack, and,
as far as the dress-maker is
concerned, is easier to cut, sew
and drape.
It is in the field of washing

and ironing that the synthetics
appeal to the busy housewife.
There is as yet no way of
washing wool, successfully
and repeatedly, other than by
hand, and it must be dried
with equal care, whereas the
synthetics, on the whole, seem
to take rougher laundering
methods much more happily,
and they dry quickly, needing
little or no ironing.
C.5.1.R.0. has helped the
wool industry immensely by
evolving a method of cheap
and efficient moth-proofing as
well as a way of making
pleats and creases stay-put. It
would appear to be up to the
spinners and manufacturers to
make wider use of both these
practical aids. Hitherto,
another thing in favor of the
synthetics was that insect-
pests, like moths and silverfish,
didn’t fancy them in their
diet. Moth-proofed woollen
materials are still the exception
rather than the rule, and it. is
difficult to buy a dress-length
that has been thus treated. .
The glamor is ' there, all
right ; it is practicability and
economy, particularly in the
laundering line, that woollen
cloths need. — Alma (N.S.W.).
The Teaching of English
Changes in teaching-methods
over the past 20 years should
have resulted in the turning-
out of students better able to
express themselves in clear
language both spoken and
written. It hasn’t.
The general weakness in
spelling appears to spring from
two causes: (1) the fallacious
notion that spelling can be
taught by means of phonetics,
(2) learning by rpte has fallen
into disfavor.
As to grammar, possibly the
old-time teacher erred on the
side of pedantry. Today the
pendulum has swung in the
opposite direction. The in-
sufficient emphasis placed on
grammatical correctness has its
result in slovenly speech and
writing, and renders the task of
learning a foreign language
more difficult.
Poor spelling and weak
grammar are, formidable handi-
caps to self-expression, which
is hindered further by lack of
practice in English composi-
tion. Essay-writing is largely
neglected today. Admittedly
the essay, as .a branch of
literature, has little appeal to
the modern mind; but the
writing of formal essays upon
• set subjects once a weekly
task for most students at
least gave training in the corn-
mitting of ideas to paper. In
its place we now have the
“project,” consisting mainly of
pasting-up photographs and
selected snippets of informa-
tion of doubtful value,
Until our schools revert to a
serious attempt to teach spell-
ing,. grammar and English
composition, they will con-
tinue to turn-out students with

instalment and it'll be our very own!"
plenty of ideas but precious
little ability to express them.
—Doynest (Vic.).
New States
That the creation of new
States would mean more capital
cities is no argument against
them (B. 7/5/’5B). It is one of
the strongest in their favor.
One of the worst features of
the present Australian scene
is the concentration of most
of the tertiary-educational
facilties, and cultural amenities
(drama, music, reference-
libraries, scientific institutes,
art galleries, museums, etc.) in
the handful of capitals. New
capitals would acquire their
own cultural institutions.
Admittedly a little has been
done in recent years towards
the decentralisation of univer-
sity facilities, and the bringing
of good plays, leading visiting
musicians, and art exhibitions
to provincial areas, but there
would be far more of that if
Australia were divided into
smaller States.
Politically, the development
would be advantageous. It
would make the Senate far
more representative of regional
interests. Today the big-city
vote has actually more influence
in determining the composition
of the Senate than it has of
the House of Representatives.
The Country party, against all
competition, can win a number
of seats in the lower chamber,
but, lacking the election-pact
with the Liberal .party, it is
doubtful if, even with pro-
portional representation, it
could return a single Senator.
A distinguished British Con-
stitutional authority once
described the U.S: Senate as
being “the most impressive and
firmly-rooted second chamber
in the world.” That designation
is as true today, mainly because
of the diversity in character of
the States of the Union. That
diversity is due to their number
and moderate size.
With a greater number of
States there would be develop-
ment of harbors that are now
neglected, or only moderately
used.
Increase in the number of
States would also make more
likely a recasting of Federal
and State powers. . Many
who, under present con-
ditions, will not vote for exten-
sion of Federal powers, would
change their minds if the
regional basis of the Senate
made it an effective curb on the
lower house. Farinmail

Censorship
What about the once banned
and damned authors who have
now. been unbanned? Aren’t
they entitled to Compensation?
They must have suffered in
both reputation and pocket.
One, at least, went to jail,
though not through the agency
of a Customs official but of
a Victorian court. This, of
course, was purely accidental —
his book was published in Aus-
tralia.
I refer to my old friend Bob
Close, the sailor-author now
luxuriating on his yacht on the
Riviera. He told me he
thoroughly enjoyed his stay in
Pentridge, bugs and all. It
threw him into the company
of murderers, thugs and other
interesting people he would
never have met if he had beeu
a more acceptable author and
mixed exclusively in literary
circles. But that is beside the
point: the point is, why*
wouldn't he be entitled to com-
pensation if it could be estab-
lished that this act of censor-
ship, like those revised by the
Customs, was a mistake?
He wrote his book in a hut
in a paddock near the place
* where I live, and used to come

and read us chapters of it.
It seemed to us then tender

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
ON COWS AND HOW TO MILK THEM (1)
This J* the first of several articles by Dr. W. G. Whittlestone,
who was in charge of dairy-husbandry at the Ruakura
(N.Z.) Animal Research Station before his recent appoint-
ment as Reader in Dairy Husbandry at Sydney University.
Ti/TY main v interest in life is
the daily cow. This is an
article on the diary cow and
how to get on with her. During
the past 10 years or so I have
been studying the dairy cow,
particularly as she responds in
the cowshed.
This has brought me in
contact not only with some
interesting and difficult dairy
cows, but with some even more
interesting dairyfarmers. It has
also brought to my attention
the kind of cowshed where the
cows and farmers meet. This
has given rise to an interest
in how the farmer behaves
when he is with his cows in
the cowshed.
In what follows (in this and
future articles) I want to tell
you of some of my experiences
and conclusions which have
arisen as a result of experi-
ments and various expeditions
into the habitat of the dairy-

farmer, or “cow-cocky” as he
is known to most of us.
This means that we will talk
of cows and milk, of cowsheds
and how to behave therein,
and, above all, of how to get
the most milk from a cow with
the least possible effort.
To start with, I want to
discuss the cow.
The modem dairy cow is
almost an artificial animal. For
generations she has been bred
with one object in mind —to
produce milk. In -New Zealand,
my native land, where most
milk is turned into cheese or
butter, and the milk is paid for
on the basis of butterfat
content, most of our cows are
the ladylike Jersey small,
polite, and capable of a
remarkable annual production
of butterfat.
The richness and golden
color of Jersey milk are some-
thing of which the Jersey-
breeder is very proud. Of
course, in New Zealand near
the cities there are many cows
bred to produce large volumes
of milk for sale to the city-
dweller. No processing is
required for this commodity
other than the removal of con-
tamination and pasteurising to
kill the bugs picked-up some-
where between the cow and the
factory.
Town milk is paid for on a
volume basis (with certain
minima of quality). How
artificial the modern cow, is is
nicely demonstrated by the fact
that today in N.Z. there are
Friesian cows capable of pro-
ducing enormous volumes of
milk which has in effect had
water added to it during the
process of secretion. In other
words, modern breeding-
methods have made it possible
to produce a cow capable of
watering her own milk a
truly amazing achievement. J.
have heard it said that Aus-
tralian breeders are not far
behind New Zealanders in this
wonder of the times.
Modern breeding-methods,
then, have made the original
cow, who in her native state
would rear perhaps two calves,
into an animal capable of
supporting a small herd. We
have in the course of this
process done something else of
great interest. Once upon a
time to milk a cow a dairy-
maid or, less romantically, a
farmhand would sit on a three-
legged stool and by a tiring
and monotonous process would
squeeze the milk out of the
cow one teatful at a time.
This had its compensations
in olden times. I have often
wondered if> the traditional
beauty of the dairymaid was
not due to the fact that her
frequent intimate contact with
her bovine charges caused her
to contract harmless cowpox,
thus protecting her from the
disfiguring smallpox which
caused many a beauty to lose
her charm in former times.
From the cow’s point of view
this hand-milking process was
very stimulating. This made
her ready to give down her
milk. We have all heard of
the famous milkers who could
always get more milk from a
cow' than their fellows. There
is no doubt from practical
experience that a good milker
can get more milk.
When milking-machines w'ere
tried for the first time the
results were appalling. The
engineers who made the
machines knew nothing of,
physiology, and the physi-
ologists thought it beneath
them to consider so mundane
a problem as the milking of a
cow. So a primitive mechanism
was fitted to the sensitive teats
of a cow used to being milked
by hand. Some of the milk was
obtained, but the rest had to
be drawn by hand. Thus arose
the custom of hand-stripping
after machine-milking. (Not
long ago it was not uncommon
in country areas in New Zea-
land to read an advertisement
sorhewhat along these lines:
“Wanted young girl to help
with milking, must be prepared
to strip.”)
The reason why hand-
stripping was necessary follow-
ing machine-milking becomes
clear when one goes into the
physiology of the milking
process. Suffice at the moment
to note the facts. Despite its
difficulties, machine - milking
slowly increased in popularity,
and in New Zealand just
before the last war most cows
were machine-milked (and
most were hand-stripped).’
An interesting change took
place in the dairy cow to
make this possible. . Quite a
high proportion of cows, when
machines were tried, failed to
respond at all. A proportion
did, however, and over the
years we have bred cows which
will milk-out more -or - less
completely to a machine,
Because farmers cull their
cows for low production,
regardless of cause, those in-
capable of being machine-
milked were culled, and as a
result the machine-milking
ability of our dairy herds
increased,
At the beginning of the last
war most cows in New Zea-
land were machine-milked and
hand-stripped. Then came the
war. Men on the land were
scarce. Dad had to go back
to the cowshed when young
Jimmy went off to the war.
Mum, too, often helped,
At this time there was good
reason to suspect that hand-

Patchy rain during the spring.
General rains, heaviest in the southern divisions, are
indicated for N. S. Wales during June. There may be gaies

rains in July, and there may be serious flooding in the
Wimmera, northern division, Latrobe Valley and Upper
Yarra.
South Australia should also have good rains in June,
heaviest in the Stirling Ranges and south-east. Flooding
is likely in the central districts.
There should be good general rains in W.A. during
June, heavy on the coast from Geraldton southwards. Rain-

stripping is not really necessary
if certain improvements are
made in the milking methods.
Experiments were made
at both the Wallaceville and
Ruakura Animal Research
Stations in New Zealand, and
these, together with careful
field-surveys, suggested that
hand-stripping can definitely
be eliminated, though it was
found that a percentage of cows
required what is called “stimu-
lating machine-stripping” a
process which is easier and
more hygienic than hand-
stripping.
I remember during our field-
surveys a very graphic account
of -an accidental experiment.
It was told by an old cocky
way outr in the sticks in the
North Auckland province. Old
Kaspar believed in herd-testing
and knew accurately the indi-
vidual productions of his herd.
He had bought a line of rather
wild heifers which tried to
kick him out of the-shed when
he attempted to strip them,
though they stood well enough
with the machines on.
So, as Kaspar put it, “I
decided to let the b s
strip their b selves.”
(There were 16 or so of
them —a reasonable sample for
an experiment.) At the end of
the season Kaspar looked at
his production-figures. The
non-stripped heifers compared
not at all unfavorably with the
other heifers and the rest of
the herd, all of which were
hand-stripped. “When I
realised this,” said Kaspar, “I
decided that for the last twenty
years I’d been stripping them
b s for b exercise! ”
Thereafter the herd was not
stripped, and subsequent years
have more than justified the
results of Kaspar’s experiment.
Since the war the labor-
shortage in country districts has
remained. Labor has become
the largest single cost in the
production of milk. This has
given rise to the development
of better ways of using labor.
At one time the amount of
labor required on a dairyfarm
was determined by the cowshed.
The elimination of hand-
stripping helped to reduce the
need for labor. And more
recently some efficient systems
of milking have been adopted
which have greatly increased
the output per man. These
systems have raised
problems: One is the need to
eliminate machine-stripping in
Order to streamline the milking-
process.
In the light of present
knowledge it may be said that
if a farmer is prepared to cull
for poor milking-characteristics
and to eliminate machine-
stripping, while at the same
time attempting to obtain
replacements from strains with
good free-milking character-
istics, he can successfully
eliminate the need for any form
of stripping.
Studies in the field and at the
laboratory show that there is
quite a variety of milking
characteristics within a large
non-selected herd. The appli-
cation of a good milking
routine with no stripping of
any kind will usually reveal a
few cows which do not fit such
a regime. Good farmers have
shown that within a few years
it is possible to build a
herd which can be milked satis-
factorily from a production
point of view with no stripping
at all.
Thus it is possible to select
and breed cows suitable to the
modern cowshed, which is
becoming harder and harder to
staff because of the shortage
of labor. Recent N.Z. figures
have shown that the average
productions of herds totally
non-stripped are a shade higher
than machine-stripped herds.
Earlier figures have shown con-
clusively that hand-stripping
does not result in arty benefit
whatever from the production
point of view. Actually, farmers
who don’t even machine-strip
are producing as much milk
per cow as their conservative
friends who still pull the teats
after the machine has done its
job.
In what I have said there are
some puzzling facts. But facts
they are. The next article will
describe the mechanism inside
the cow which produces milk
and makes it available to the
customer. An understanding of
this mechanism will throw a lot
of light on what in the past
have beep some very dark
places in the cowshed.
Cheviots
The general fall of about
40 per cent, at Sydney
sheep-sales this year was
described as “disastrous” by the
experts, while buyers attributed
the “dead sale” to falling wool-
prices. Flock-ram prices fell
50 per cent, compared with
1957 biddings. More than half
the lots were passed in.
A contingent of Cheviots
brought the sun into the some-
what gloomy atmosphere of the
Showground salesroom. Prices
jumped by about 20 per cent,
and seemed to indicate that it
will be a “dual-purpose” year,
particularly in Victoria, where
the Cheviot is better known.
The Cheviot, in shortwools
class, possesses a 56/50
“count,” and 3in. to 4in. staple.
This breed is considered
the most popular mountain
breed in the United Kingdom
and is coming into its own in
Australia. Tasmanian country
and climate are very suitable'
for it.
A South-west Slopes (N. S.
Wales) grazier with a large
Merino run is stocking his
Tablelands area (approximately
280 acres) with the Cheviot
breed. He will later join flock
Border-Leicester rams to his
Cheviot ewes. The hill country,
with its more rigorous climate,
will suit the Cheviot well. Good
green valleys and a permanent
running creek will provide
suitable grazing in the 26in.-
rainfall district.
Some features of the
Cheviot:
The mutton-quality is good
(though not up to the “Downs”"
breeds); the sheep is hardy,,
late-maturing and well adapted
to cold conditions ; the wool is
in great demand for manu-
facture of Cheviot cloth, or for
blending in the production of
Scottish tweeds —whether Aus-
tralian manufacturers have
found as much use for this
class of wool remains. to be
seen.
The Cheviot is not so large
as the longwool breeds, and
is square, compact and rather
low-set for a mountain breed.
Further details:
Head: Hornless, medium-
size, wide forehead, free of
wool, and covered with fine
.white hair—sometimes an odd
black spot. Strong Roman nose
with wide black nostrils, ears
carried erect, covered with
white hair —also an occasional
black spot.
Neck: Strong, deep, wide
shoulders.
Back : Straight and fleshy.
Ribs: Well strung.
Hindquarters: Good.
Legs are short, white and
free of wool, with black hoofs.
Eyes are very active and alert.

Jersey Exports
“Wahoo”: Although disap-
pointed by bad news from the
U.K. butter-market, Austra-
lian dairymen should be heart-
ened by the steady Japanese
demand (2500 a year) for our
top-grade Jersey heifers.
In Japan’s limited grazing-
area, the lightly built Jerseys
are finding favor,after initial
importations of high-yielding
but heavier Friesians which,
have not done so well in the
mountains —and no wonder, in
view of the breed’s early
development on Holland’s flat
country.
Most of Australia’s Jerseys
for the Far East are bought by
top Japanese animal experts,
and mostly come from
Victorian and N. S. Wales
studs. The Japanese Govern-
ment supervises the distribu-
tion of these imports to
farmers.
With Japan also buying Aus-
tralian sheep, the outlet to
the Far East is growing. For
many years there has been a
small but regular trade in sheep
for eating from the north-west
coast of Australia to Singa-
pore. The Philippines have
also been interested in buying
Australian meat.
Onions
“Sundowner”: Onions are
practically an all-the - year-
round vegetable and one of the
most valuable to gardeners—
market or home.
In sandier districts they can
be grown as a crop-rotation,
not as a main crop. Under
such a system the soil for pre-
vious crops would have been
fairly well fertilised wjth
“You certainly picked a miserable, Wet day to come
out for mushrooms!”
manures and artificial ferti-
lisers. This ensures a higher-
than-average yield in subse-
quent plantings.
Early varieties, such as Early
Flat White, White Rocket,
Silverskin and Early Barletta,
mature in the spring, are mild
in flavor and widely popular.
They are harvested, too, when
the übiquitous brown is near-
ing the end of its life.
Mid-season types, such as
Brighton Globe, Golden Globe
and Brown Globe, may be
sown during May, while the
late brown should be sown in
June or July.
For salad-onions sought the
year round any of the fore-
going species may be har-
vested as immature onions
when not more than a quarter-
inch in diameter. The White
Lisbon is also excellent for
salad purposes and may be
sown heavily at any time in
drill-rows LOin. to 12in. apart.
The amount of fertiliser
depends on the rate of applica-
tion for any previous crop on
the same ground, but generally
4cwt. to 8 cwt. an acre of 5:2:1
mixed fertiliser is advised.
Don’t use animal or poultry
manures before sowing, but as
a top- or side-dressing when
the crop has reached a height
of Bin. If growth slackens, try
further side-dressings of 2:2:1,
or equal quantities of sulphate
of ammonia (or nitrate of soda)
and muriate of potash at lcwt.
to 2cwt. per acre.
•Except for spring- or salad-
onions all varieties should be
transplanted from seed-beds,
which should be limed freely
and kept free of weeds for some
weeks before planting-out.
Beds should be raised to a
height of 9in. at sowing-time.
Transplanting is best done
when seedlings have reached a
height of about Bin. and they
should not be placed more
than lin. deep.
Beekeeping
“B-herd” : Here is some fur-
ther information on beekeep-
in g for that inquirer in
the Service Depart-
ment (B. 21/5/’5B).
There are several
elementary factors to
consider before
keeping bees. First,
forage. Besides water,
bees need a stack of
nectar and pollen—
without that, disap-
pointment and ex-
pense are just round
the corner. Not every
locality offers bee-
forage. Thousands
of acres of home-
garden and open
country' won’t return
the expense of the
bee-boxes. There are
also millions of acres
of forest-country on
the eastern falls of
this continent which
produce little more
than shade, and,
generally speaking,
no fortune awaits the
enthusiast this side
of the inland.
.If a beginner wants
to establish a colony
merely for the
murmur of the work-
ing bees, almost any
place will suit, but
if he wants good
honey he will need
the “belbowries” near
him for the winter,
ironbarks close by for spring,
brush - boxes for Christmas
and bloodwoods and stringies
for autumn. And because
they can miss year after
year, he’ll want paddocks
of clover and dandelion and
other bits and pieces to keep
his colony alive.
A 44-gal. drum of water is
handy, but it’s not enough. As
for the actual place of setting-
down the hives, it is inadvisable
to look for a shaded corner,
because the cool, shady spot
in summer becomes a grave-
yard for frozen colonies in
winter. Bees prefer warmth.
Find ’em a sunny, open spot
and for nine or ten months of
the year they’ll thank you for
it. They’ll even enjoy the

remaining two months of sun-
burn, although it does mean a
bit of extra work on the fans.
Staggering the supers is no
work for the beginner, par-
ticularly on the coast, where
robbing conditions prevail.
Bees like to feel secure from
the marauder outsider. So
leave the hives alone. Stagger-
ing the supers went out with
the skep.
Next, breed. Don’t take
any old bee. Go for the Cau-
casian first —they are the quiet-
est. While the beginner fumbles
about and half-suffocates them
with smoke, they’ll be the most
tolei*ant of his miserableness.
Later, experiment with the
Italians —good gatherers, but
not so good - natured. The
swarm in the tree is usually a
bush-black, a cross of the
English-black with a smudge
of Italian. The more black on
the tail the harder they sit
down.
There is also the question of
temperament, not of the bees
but of the beekeeper. Most
people are wrong for bee-
keeping. The best bee-herd is
gentle, thoughtful and con-
siderate, and not given to wav-
ing arms and legs in a half-wild
fashion. The best of them
you’re glad to see come in the
gate, and that may rule out all
but a handful of the human
herd. If you’re not the right
one for this particular task go
in for something else. Bees are
featherweights, but in the end
they’ll win the fight.
Unthrifty Weaners
“Kyora”: While other States
and countries are dosing
weaners against worms and
poking oats into them to stop
serious losses through unthrifti-
ness, South Australia has
announced that the trouble can
be licked to the tune of half-a-
million pounds extra in local
woolgrowers’ pockets every
year.
Poor growth and quality of
wool, and delayed maturity of
ewes, can be stopped by keep-
ing high-grade feed up to the
weaners from the time they
young. The main trouble is
that young sheep cannot
accommodate very much food,
and when their stomachs are
filled with dry grass without
much nutrition in it the
weaners lose condition and
the worms take over. Some
weaners eventually refuse to
eat, and starve themselves to
death.
Owners should aim to get
their weaners to a high body-
weight before the summer feed
dries-off. An 801 b. weaner in
January can afford to lose 151 b.
before striking trouble. Even
then, supplementary feeding
can prevent deaths.
Best supplements include
perennial grasses, clovers,
lucerne and summer fodder-
crops. Otherwise, say the S.A.
experts, give them grains such
as oats and barley.
Queensland Cows
“ Agricola ”: Queensland
cows continue to set the pace
for butterfat-records.
Sunnyvale Little Princess,
owned by J. Phillips and Sons,
set an Australian record for
a junior four-year-old with
24,6301 b. of milk and 10531 b.
of butterfat in one lactation.
With another year or so to
settle-in, she’ll be breaking
Melba of Darbalara’s record
of 16141 b. of butterfat.
A Jersey cow, owned by J.
Carpenter, entered the Lifetime
Merit Register by giving
43,3071 b. of milk and 23361 b.
of butterfat in lactations. She
is Brisbane champion, Mayfair
Queenie 2nd.
Golden Grass
“Plymouth”: Although
maize has been greatly domes-
ticated since discovered by
Columbus about 1492, it could
not survive for two or three
years without man. Scientists
think it would revert to the
wild grass from which it was
believed to have sprung about
60,000 years ago—a grass which
many people believe to be
corn’s ancestor still grows in
Mexico and Central America.
For each grain that is sown
these days, 600 to 1000 kernels
are harvested.
American Indians ferti-
lised their crops with a dead
fish placed in each hill of corn.
Commercial fertilisers have
replaced the fish, and hybrid
seed is sown today instead of
the open-pollinated varieties.
Indians also discovered the
secret of sowing the seeds some
distance apart instead of too
closely.
Mexican Dam
Correction
H. A. Lindsay: Don’t know
if it was an error in my copy
(B. 30/4/’5B), but the figures
given for a sandbed which
could hold up to a million
gallons of water should read:
“1000 ft. long, 50ft. wide and
10ft. deep.” A creekbed deposit
of sand 100 ft. long, as printed,
would hold only 100,000
gallons.
Farm Hints
“Sarina”: Throughout the
cane areas it is a good idea
to drive right around the
paddocks two or three times
with the bumper disk-cultivator
behind the tractor just before
the harvesting starts in July.
It makes a good firebreak for
burning-back if a grass-fire
comes along when you are busy
cutting and carting. And just
before the wet season, when
you are done with cultivating
the coming crop, take the disk-
plough around a couple of
times. The bank of soil does
much to prevent stormwater
rushing fast out of the
paddocks and carrying a lot
of topsoil with it.
“Sundowner”: A plastic
film to protect sheep is achiev-
ing popularity in the U.S.A.
The film .is attached to a light,
pole-type framework, and
tests have shown that it with-
stands a winter’s use. The
shelters have been found par-
ticularly useful in offsetting
heavy losses from severe rain-
storms during lambing.
“W.C.Q.”: Two worthless
paspalums are giving dairymen
trouble in Queensland. One,
P. compressum, commonly
called carpet-grass, is in the
south, where,it was first propa-
gated as something useful. The
other, P. conjugation, is in the
north and central coastal areas
and on the Atherton Tableland.
Few dairymen know the latter
by name, but it looks like a
cross between buffalo-grass and
couch. It got here by unknown
means and has taken many
years to acclimatise itself ; now
it is romping. It runs through
the pastures, killing them right
out and replacing them with
its own leafage—a dense mass
of beautiful-looking grass, but
not worth tuppence for grazing.
* “Wilco”: Most millets are
good cow-fodder (B. 9/4/’5B),
but there’s an outlaw in the
family—Arabian millet, better-
known here as Johnson-grass.
Sometimes it crops-up amongst
Sudan-grass, which it closely
resembles except in one way—
the Sudan is a shallow rooter
whereas the Johnson - grass
strikes deep. It is very toxic,
while Sudan-grass, if grazed
with care, will never injure
cattle.
“Fern”: Tile drains, or agri-
cultural pipes as they are often
called, are more costly to install
than either open or mole
drains, but in the long run
they are usually much
more satisfactory. Once tile,
drains are properly installed
little maintenance is required
and no land is rendered
unproductive.
“J.J.”: When mulching
fruit-crops it is essential that
the mulch should be deep
enough to suppress weeds. If
the mulch is too thin weeds
will come through and
cause trouble. A layer of
settled mulch 3in.-4in. deep is
recommended.


Women's Letters
MELBOURNE
Guests who attended the dinner at
Menzies’, arranged by Lady Selleck and
a large committee to assist the Anti-
Cancer Campaign, were transported back
to the days of Louis XIV. It is doubtful,
though, if the women who fluttered
around the Sun King’s Court were more
beautiful, graceful or elegant than those
who graced the dinner in the most beauti-
ful dining-room in the city, turned for
the occasion into the Orangerie of the
Palace of Versailles. Powdered and
bewigged footmen opened car-doors or
ushered guests through an illuminated
canopy set across the foyer. In the
Orangerie more footmen held large can-
delabra. Cascades of colorful grapes set
on the official table mingled with water-
lilies, and antique gold candelabra
showed-off this lovely setting. On the
smaller tables, gold-painted candelabra
shed a soft light over the decorations of
red carnations and green hydrangeas
showing against the white damask cloths.
French music was played throughout
the meal and a French minuet was per-
formed. Each course was announced in
French by a major domo, then carried in
accompanied by the chef, members of the
court in full dress, and a jester. The
meal —quite a marathon—was served
with Australian vodka, sherry, claret,
moselle and champagne. For good mea-
sure there were the singing of the “Mar-
seillaise,” and toasts to the Queen and to
General de Gaulle.
The Governor was unable to be present,
but Lady Brooks was there, wearing a
bouffant gown of apricot satin with the
bodice embellished with pearls and pink
and white rhinestones. Also in the official
party were the Lord Mayor and Lady
Mayoress (Mrs. Thomas wearing a
formal gown of spice-brown lace over
taffeta); Lady Selleck, handsome in a
pervenche-blue silk-taffeta gown, the
bodice of which was embroidered with
crystal-beads and rhinestones ; Mrs. W. J.
Kilpatrick (her husband is chairman of
the campaign), who chose a sheath-
gown of tabac lace, the skirt highlighted
with a wide back-panel of matching
taffeta ; the Ambassador for France (M.
Renaud Sivan); External Affairs Minister
R. G. Casey ; and Mr. R. Markillie and
his daughter Miss O. Markillie (her full-
length gown being of black delustred
satin. The function was donated entirely
by the Federal Hotels management.
Marion McPherson (who was joint
ticket-secretary with Lady Connelly) chose
a white lace gown mounted on tulle;
Lady Connelly’s choice was oyster-grey
satin embroidered with iridescent stones.
Committee - members Mrs. Maurice
Nathan, Lady Amies, Lady Richardson,
Mrs. Geoffrey Tolson, Mrs. W. K. Burn-
side and Mrs. E. B. Coles were all
eye-catching in their glamorous gowns.
Noelle, only daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Norman Grieve, of Malvern, has
announced her engagement to John
David, elder son of Mr. and Mrs. David
Ely, of Moonee Ponds. Recently back
from a trip overseas with her parents,
Noelle was educated at the Methodist
Ladies’ College and began her nursing
training at the Melbourne School of
Nursing. She is now a sister at the Royal
Children’s Hospital. Her fiance, an old
Scotch Collegian, has had experience in
London and Scottish hospitals—he is in
the X-ray department of the Royal
Children’s Hospital. Last year he was
president of the English Speaking Union
younger group.
A large birthday-cake surrounded by
glowing poinsettias had pride of place on
the table when president Mrs. Mark
Clements and members of the American
Women’s Auxiliary of the Royal Child-
ren’s Hospital celebrated the 27th anni-
versary of the auxiliary’s founding with
a birthday-luncheon at the home of Mrs.
Graham Hall, wife of the U.S. Consul-
General. These women have set a splen-
did record for voluntary service ; since
its inauguration the auxiliary has raised
over £46,000 for the hospital.
Stage and TV star Evie Hayes, smart
in a blue-and-green-printed silk frock and
a petal cap in two tones of pink, was
welcomed by Mrs. Hall, who wore a
black lightweight-wool suit, the jacket
featuring a black velvet collar. Mrs.
Clements wore with her grey-and-black
tweed frock a black-and-white satin
curvette. For their 10 years’ work for
the auxiliary Mrs. Earl Daum (a former
president), Mrs. F. Callahan and Mrs. A.
Klestadt received silver spoons. Farewells
were said to Mrs. D. S. Drucker (Dr.
Drucker, who has been head of the U.S.
Information Department in this city,
moves on to Washington), Mrs. G. F.
James and Mrs. H. W. Johnson. Also
at the luncheon was Mrs. Heathcote
Wright, who is president of this year’s
July 4 function, “The Yankee Doodle
Do,” which will be held at the St. Kilda
Palais.

The anniversary of the founding of the
Republic of Italy was celebrated with a
cocktail-party at the Toorak home of
Consul-General the Marchese Giorgio
Serafini and the Marchesa Serafini (who
wore a short black French re-embroidered
lace frock). Their daughter, Patrizia
(whose chemise-frock was of black wool),
and niece Flavia Spalazzi (who is engaged
to Lieut. John Groves, R.N., an A.D.C. to
the Governor), assisted with the hostess-
ing.
Guests included the Consul for the
Republic of China and Madame Leung
(she wearing a lovely white satin national-
dress); the Consul for the Netherlands,
Mr. M. Shoo, and his wife; Mr. Hamil-
ton Sleigh (Consul for Finland), and Mrs.
Sleigh (whose frock was of deep-purple
silk-shantung); the Consul for Panama
(Mr. Geoffrey Sly) and his wife; the
Consul- for Monaco (Mr. Michael Niall)
and Mrs. Niall; Dr. and Mrs. George
Santoro; and Mr. and Mrs. Stanley
Ridley.

More than 60 guests were welcomed at
the cocktail-party held at the home of
Mrs. Richard Linton by the president of
the Raveloe Auxiliary of the Animal
Welfare League, Marjorie Tatnall, Mrs.
Linton and honorary secretary, Pamela
Middleton. Autumn leaves, hydrangeas,
honesty, dried thistles and acorns were
used for the attractive decorations. Guest-
of-honor was the president of the league,
Dame Mabel Brookes. Committee-mem-
bers present included Dr. and Mrs. Rex
Walpole, Mr. and Mrs. Peter Lynch,
Winsome Dane, Joy Donoghue and the
two daughters of the hostess, Barbara
and Lindy Challingsworth.

An old-time evening of songs around
the piano followed the buffet dinner-party
given by Dr. and Mrs. Ray Shatin, of
Elwood, to farewell U.K. Assistant Trade
Commissioner Edwin Newbold and Mrs.
Newbold. Guests included the military
attache for Indonesia (Col. Basoeki
Rachamad) and his wife, the assistant
attache (Major Noermanli Aman) and
Mrs. Aman, Colonel F. del Castillo and
Mrs. del Castillo (Philippines) and N.Z.

Conversation during the week drifted
from General de Gaulle and the condi-
tion of France, to Professor Orr and what
could possibly be the “additional
evidence” that has not been revealed but
has brought Presbyterians, Catholics and
professors-who-won’t-apply-for-his-job to


his support. The professors haven’t heard
the evidence. They just don’t think it’s
fair.

Other topics included the horror type
introduced by Professor Marcus Oliphant,
who said that a rat nibbling through a
cable could start a series of nuclear
explosions which could destroy the world.
The previous day there was a story in
the newsprint about an ultra-violet lamp
invented by Professor Oliphant’s two
brothers. This lamp, though designed to
keep mildew from chilled-meat, had
proved more successful than the Pied
Piper in keeping rats away. So that’s
one problem solved.

Dylan Thomas, Welsh poet and play-
wright, is in vogue in Sydney at present
despite the Muggeriginal remarks about
his representing “culture.” Emlyn
Williams will return for a week’s further
readings from Dickens and Thomas at
the Assembly Hall starting next Monday,
and the Independent has a beautiful pro-
duction of “Under Milk Wood" as its
present attraction. Congratulations must
go to Paul Kathner for the clever decor
and to Doris Fitton, the producer, who,
assisted by Noelann Gandon, has brought
a play involving 60 different parts and
numerous stage-changes to an exciting
and smooth-flowing reality.

The theatrical, radio and TV com-
munity seemed to be very well represented
at the opening night of “Look Back in
Anger” at the Elizabethan Theatre, by
far the most decorative member being
Mrs. Frank Brooks (who is Margot Lee).
She lived-up to her name of “The Golden
Girl” by wearing a sheath-.dress of pale-
gold lame with a stole of nut-brown
Velvet. The theme of the play is Eng-
land’s angry young men, and the specimen
played by Ray Barrett is really cross. One
member of the audience thought it was
because his wife, Darlene Johnson, took
such an unconscionably long time to iron
his shirt.

National groups, including Dutch,
Chinese, Italian and Spanish, made a
brilliant guard-of-honor for Bishop
James Carroll at the Catholic Ball when
he received the 13 debutantes and was
himself welcomed by the president of
the ball-committee, Mr. M. J. O’Neill,
and Mrs. Kathleen Burrow. The matron-
of-honor, Mrs. Michael Fitzpatrick, wore
a Swiss-model frock of white silk
patterned with cornflower-blue mounted
on blue tulle. Dutch folk-dances were
given by members of the Netherlands
Society during the evening, and the
national costumes, together with the
yellow and white decorations and the
flower-decked tables, made a colorful
picture. Among those present were Mr.
and Mrs. J. G. Harcombe, Mr. and-Mrs.
Wal Chandler, Mr. and Mrs. James
Clough and Mr. and Mrs. Woodward.
Mrs. R. G. Pollard, wife of the G 0.C.,
Eastern Command, and president of the
Eastern Command ladies’ auxiliary,
gave the third of a series of morning-tea
parties in her leafy, sunlit garden during
the week, an interlude which made a
very pleasant pause in the day’s occupa-
tions. Guests were the service wives and
wives of C.M.F. officers, all of whom
Mrs. Pollard hopes to have met and
entertained ere long. Among those who
attended this particular party were Mrs.
J. R. Stevenson, Mrs. M. R. Buring,
Mrs. R. S. Mason, Mrs. J. S. Anderson,
Mrs. A. E. L. Morgan and Mrs. F. B.
McAlister. The Eastern Command auxi-
liary works for several organisations,
chief among them the War Widows’
Guild, for which they raised £3OOO last
year.
Playing a leading role in the Eliza-
bethan Theatre’s new production, “Look
Back in Anger,” June Collis is a girl of
many talents. A keen amateur painter
with a penchant for brilliant colors, she
has decorated her home at Camp Cove
with her own paintings, and is a great
lover of poetry—her own poems being
but one outlet for her artistic talents.
June began her career in theatre at 17 in
the Melbourne production of “The Little
Foxes,” which was produced by Robert
Quentin, now an executive of the Eliza-
bethan Theatre and for the past 12
months June’s husband. Photo by John

Hats and ballet-talk and luscious food
were highlights of the luncheon arranged
for the auxiliary for St. Margaret’s Hos-
pital at “Tara,” the North Sydney home
of Mrs. Gladys Collins, during the week.
Madame Anthony was responsible for
the hats, Paul Szilard, impresario for
•the New York City Ballet, for the ballet-
talk (from which it was interesting to
hear how well Sydney compares as patron
of ballet with other cities of the world),
and the committee for the food. Mrs.
Garth Hay was chief organiser, and those
who modelled the hats (compered most
expertly by Mrs. Des Trainer) were
Mrs. Jack Farrington, Mrs. Bob
Mclnerny, Mrs. W. Cook and Mrs. P.
Smirk.

Five newly qualified braille-writers
received their certificates at the annual
meeting of the Braille Writers’ Associa-
tion during the week. They were Miss
N. Britton, Mr. E. Dunstan, Mrs. G.
Howell, Miss M. Lance and Miss J.
Starkey. The president of the associa-
tion, Mrs. H. G. Ringland, said in her
report that there were now 125 active
members transcribing books for the
blind in N.S.W., and that 845 volumes
(a record number) were produced during
1957. Mr. H. F. Benning, honorary
secretary of the Royal Blind Society,
presented the diplomas. Mr. Leslie Rees
was the guest-speaker, and a vote of
thanks was proposed by Miss Leah
Wilson, a blind teacher from the School
for the Blind, Wahroonga, who will
leave for America in August for 12
months’ study of teaching-methods
abroad. Miss Wilson recently won a
scholarship provided by the Rotary Club
of Sydney, which will enable her to visit
both America and Europe.

Countrywomen 2000 strong attended
the annual conference of the Country
Women’s Association, which was opened
by Lady Woodward at the Town Hall
early in the week. The guest-speaker,
Sir lan Clunies Ross, who spoke to the
association in 1937, contrasted the con-
dition of Australia in those days, “when
we were content to be a small people in
many ways,” with our wonderful oppor-
tunities for expansion and development
today. Mrs. J. A. Lander, State presi-
dent, reported that there were 30,000
members in the association, although
there had been a slight falling-off among
the younger members. Sir Charles Lloyd
Jones presented the Challenge Cup to the
Saratoga branch for having made the
greatest increase during the year.

It was inevitable that as skirts grew
shorter garters would come back into
fashion. A report from America says
that jewelled garters worn just above
the knee are the latest thing, the flash
and sparkle being seen when the wearer
alights from a car, gets up from a chair
or walks up steps.

In the “You mark my words” depart-

makes bold to predict is the return of
the little buttoned boot. As tapered
pants grow shorter and narrower the

elegant little boot with pointed toe and
Louis heel is the answer.

Stan, without a doubt.
Radishes always repeated
violently on the old man.
Belching, he went to stand in
the doorway where he could
hear every word she said. She
frowned at him menacingly,
gestured to him to get out,
even spat at him once, but he
stood there undeterred, frankly
curious and interested.
“Yes,” she said sweetly into
the mouthpiece, “I’ll ask him,
Stan. That will please him

mighty! But Fiona Ramage

Here she flushed scarlet, and
wriggled distressfully, one eye,
filled with venom and threats,
on Grandpa, for all the world
as if he could hear what the
boy had said.
“Okay, then, Stan. Of course
I do. You’re nice. I’ll ask him
right now, he’s right here
well, just a short drive. No
pictures, no dropping-in on the
gang anywhere, no parking.
Righto; half-an-hour. I’ll be
ready.”
Looking a little bemused,
she hung up.
“Is it moonlight?” she asked
absently, pulling aside one
edge of the window-drape and
peering out. “Oh, good. A
huge, butterball of a moon..
randpa Zeiner was dis-
appointed. He’d fully
expected her to fly off the
handle at him, but she’d
plainly forgotten his existence.
Well, seeing the moon was
up, he’d go down and have a
look at the irrigation-channels
and the engine-room. Through
the open window he saw it,
hanging there in the sky like
a big golden papaw-pumpkin,
sun-ripened and mellow. Her
and her butterballs! He added
a particularly unrepeatable
epithet to that bit of nonsense.
She remembered about him
suddenly. “Oh, Grandpa, that
was Stan, wanting to know if
you can let him have a couple
of extra-good pumpkins for
Hallowe’en. We’re going to do
it properly this year—Stan’s
been overseas, and he knows
all about it. Keep the very best
pumpkins for us, won’t you,
Grandpa?”
She was pulling a cardigan
on, not looking at him, and he
realised she was aware neither
of him nor his pumpkins.
But he considered carefully,
ponderously, and said at last,
his voice tinged with import-
ance, “Yes, I think I’ll be able
to supply him. Yes, tell him he
can rely on me for Hallowe’en
pumpkins.”
“He says you grow the best
in the district.”
Lipstick was going on now;
she was leaning forward to
apply it, oblivious of his
pleased, happy eyes, his child-
like satisfaction.
“That’s all right,” he
chuckled. “Just see he don’t
go giving you any of the seeds
to eat. You know what hap-
pens to little girls who eat
pumpkin-seeds?”
“Oh, Grandpa, you’re
crude ! ” she £ried, shocked,
outraged and laughing.
His twinkling dark eyes held
all the bawdiness of centuries.
A car horn blared imperi-
ously out in the moonlit drive.
His ribald laughter followed
her as she sped away, red
pony-tail streaming like a
meteor behind her.
and the wind grabbed the door
from him and swung it wide,
slamming it back against the
car. Joe’s wife yelled and
grabbed him, stopping him
from tumbling out. Joe braked
violently and started swearing.
He jumped out and ran round
to the door, heedless of the
boy half-in and half-out,
vomiting.
“Look at it, will you! Look
at it!” he said to no one in
particular. “Godstrewth, I’ve
only had it a week and look
at it now!”
HThe boy climbed out and
-*• stood shivering while the
party examined the door. Joe
nursed his hand over the
dented bodywork and the
twisted top-hinge and Bill put
a length of wood under the
door to lever it square again
and crushed in more of the
metal. The women stood away
from the men, talking in the
rain.
Finally the door was closed
and Joe lashed the handle with
rope to the front-door handle
and they were moving. The
boy was still shivering. No one
said anything to him except
Joe’s wife, who chastened him
quietly: “You were a very
lucky boy.”
May took a paper bag from
the food-basket and placed it
on her lap.
Now he felt wretched. His
bare arms and legs were
goosefleshed, yet he was hot.
The sickness had not helped
him, but had left him only
with the knowledge that he
would be sick again. How much
would all the damage cost? He
was almost unbearably hungry.
He was also tired, but he could
not close his eyes in case the
giddiness should start-up. He
sat stiffly forward, eyes trying
to drag road and destination
faster toward the car.
“I ... I think I’m” he
managed to get out when it
happened again.
“Hell’s bells, it can’t be!” said
Joe exasperatedly, but he was
already slowing the car.
“Quick! Somebody back there
give him something.”
But the car had stopped and
the boy managed to climb
past the two women to the
good door and get outside first.
He climbed back in silence
and he knew he smelt badly
from the way the women
ignored it. He wanted to cry.
“Maybe you’d better open
the window,” said Joe.
They did, but Joe’s wife said,
“Oh, Joe, we can’t. The rain’s
coming in and the wind’s blow-
ing May’s hair everywhere.”
“No, no, don’t worry about
me,” said May. But they
closed the window just the
same.
This time he had to close
his eyes. He lay back and
knew the giddiness was about
to creep up on him, but he
didn’t care. His eyes were
moist and he tried to squeeze
the moistness around so that
it would not spill as tears.
The women were talking and
when the horrid uprush caught
him May wasn’t quick enough
with the bag. The boy, half-
asleep, vomited across her
dress and, as she moved hastily,
on the seat.
Joe swore again and May
kept saying alternately, “Oh! ”
and things like, “Don’t worry ;
it’s old and it will wash.” And
Joe’s wife looked on desolated,
big hands clutching a tiny
hankie that she did not proffer.
Now the boy did cry,
snuffling to himself in his hot-
cold little corner of solitude.
Tt was quite dark when Joe
spoke to him.
“All right now, boy; wipe
those tears away. You’re
nearly there. Don’t want to
look like death when you meet
your uncle.”
When they stopped, Joe
climbed out and got the boy’s
suitcase from the boot, putting
it at the youngster’s feet. He
said nothing until he had
climbed back in.
“Tell your uncle we were in
a hurry. I’ll phone him to-
morrow.”
The boy waited for the car
to move away from him and
his suitcase and the carton, but
Joe seemed to be waiting for
a signal.
“Okay?” he asked the back
seat.
“Just a minute,” said his wife.
She opened the window and
said to the boy, “Your Aunt
Jean will fix you with a nice
hot bath . . . I’m sorry you
had such a bad trip, but you’re
here now, and that’s what
matters, isn’t it?”
The boy had stopped
snuffling, but it was a long
time before he said, “Yes.”
The word seemed a sullen
accusation. Joe’s wife could
feel the boy staring at her.
It made her uncomfortable.
He had no right, she told her-
self in a flare of anger.
“Well, you don’t seem to be
very grateful.”
He just kept staring at her.
Get the car started, Joe, she
thought.
Then the boy moved nearer
Joe’s door and looked in.
“So long, boy,” said Joe
quietly.
“I’m glad I was sick on your
car,” said the boy.


mean “United Kingdom
British” —regarded themselves
as giving news, as formers and
directors of political opinion,
and even political education.
under the econo-
mic pressure of great
circulations with attendant
advertising revenue, news-
papers have found themselves
rather falling into the
psychology of the crowd,
which, of course, is the
lowest common denomi-
nator, and have exchanged the
great influence they had on
national and international
policy for the equally great,
and perhaps greater, influence
on everyday tastes and morals
and sense of values.
That is perfectly legitimate.
There is no reason why a
newspaper should not turn
itself into that. In fact, it may
be a very good thing indeed.
Of course, it all depends on
what sort of influence it exerts
—whether it raises, maintains
or depresses these standards of
tastes and morals and sense
of values.
Sometimes, as good citizens
first and as good journalists
afterwards, I think you must
wonder whether your news-
paper does raise or even main-
tain those standards. Some-
times, I am afraid, we are not
all sure.
What can we do?
The ordinary working
journalist collects -the news and
writes it up, or perhaps writes
the leading article. He has as
much control over the policy of
a newspaper as the ordinary
soldier has over the strategy
of a campaign.
That is unavoidable.
I should have resented very
much if every private soldier
had told me how to conduct
a campaign. Many young
officers did —but let it go at
that!
A general knows that men
fight and work because there is
work and fighting to be done,
but they fight and work better
for some cause in which they
believe. Every young general
learns by experience that the
ordinary man is much more
responsive to appeals to higher
standards than a lot of people
would like us to think.
You are very right in defend-
ing the freedom of the press.
I would defend it, too.
’ I do not think you can have
a free country of any sort
unless you have a free press.
But do not forget that a free
press, even because of its
freedom, may be an enemy of
the democratic way of life. It
has been in some countries.
will not work
unless the ordinary people
are people of reasonable educa-
tion, decent morals and sound
judgment. Any agency which
tends to depress these things
is liable to deprive itself of
the freedom of which it boasts
—and not only itself but all
the rest of us.
I am not appealing to you
not to be rough with politicians,
because it is an occupational
hazard of their profession;
but it is very wrong to decry
the actual institutions of
democracy like Parliament,
councils and the rest of it.
It has happened in France
—and it has done no good
to France or anybody else.
But any control or restraint
or guidance of the press which
is or may be wanted cannot
come from outside.
I cannot do it, nor can the
Government, because anything
in the nature of censorship is
much more serious than the
disease it tries to. cure. It can
only come from inside your
own profession. It can come
from a great body of journalists
which upholds certain prin-
ciples.
I am not a starry-eyed
idealist. I know it is no good
trying to fill newspapers with
talk of high ideals and noble
platitudes.
You aj£ in the same category
as clergymen, soldiers and
doctors. Yours is not a trade
or a profession. It is a voca-
tion and requires just as high
standards as the high standards
of those other honored pro-
fessions —standards that can
only come from within you.
There is no new idea in this.
But you need not be put off
by the fact that in some
countries they have tried
various forms of firess-councils
to maintain the high standards
of integrity and professional
conduct in the journalist’s pro-
fession.
Do not be put off because
they have not been successful.
The first time a man
launched a boat it probably did
not float—but later on it did.
There is one thing about
which I feel strongly. It is
my experience that anything
that has been organised and
devised in Australia by Aus-
tralians for Australians is about
the best thing of its type in
the world.
You have your Flying
Doctor service. You invented
it, you work it, and you run
it.
You have Legacy—the best
ex-servicemen’s organisation in
the world. Your organisation
is superb.
Nobody runs racing on the
grand scale anything like as
well as you do in Australia.
I mean that seriously. You do
it jolly well.
So, as journalists, do not be
discouraged because other
people have tried and failed.
You Australians can do it.
I hope that in this club you
will find enjoyment, solace and
recreation in intervals of what
you must, at times, find a
frustrating job. One of the
best things a club can offer
is a good talk.

revert to something the
Governor-General said you
will have paid me an even
greater compliment than asking
me here this afternoon to enjoy
your hospitality. That is a
compliment I value very much.
And so, with the warmest
goodwill to your club and to
your members, I have the
greatest pleasure in declaring
this club now open.

honest assessment of costs.
The National Accounts
By some pretty skiiful
juggling the Minister *of
Finance, Mr. Nordmeyer, has
contrived to produce an
apparent balance in the
national accounts for the year
Jo March 31.
The deficit in the Consoli-
dated Fund is only £155,000.
But it would have been
£14,155,000 if the usual transfer
to the Social Security Fund
had been made.
The transfer has not been
made, and, as a result, the
Social Security Fund shows a
loss of £12,392,000. This is
made up by running-down the
Social Security Fund’s reserves
from £l7 million to something
over £4 million.
The reserves will be re-
couped, according to what Mr.
Nordmeyer told the. House of
Representatives in February,
when the Government collects
from self-employed persons the
social-security tax due on
income earned during the past
financial year.
Income was nearly £2l
million less than estimated.
This was the approximate cost
of the £lOO tax-rebate offered
by the Labor Party as election
bait. It had been estimated that
the rebate would cost £l9
million, after making allow-
ance for the National Party’s
tax-rebate offer of 25 per cent.
With an upper limit of £75.
Some of the principal taxes
exceeded expectations. Cus-
toms-duty, reflecting heavier
importing, was up by nearly
£2 million. Sales-tax brought
in £1.5 million more, and
■estate-, racing- and stamp-
duties nearly £1 million more.
To give the Government
credit where it is due, it should
be mentioned that all the main
groups of annual appropria-
tions were underspent. Total
expenditure from the Consoli-
dated Fund was £l6 million
less than the estimate and £9.3
million less than the actual
expenditure in the previous
year. If the usual transfer to
the Social Security Fund had
been made total expenditure
Would have been £207.7
million, £2 million • less than
the estimate, but £4.7 million
more than last year.
The Loan-market
The Government’s £7,703,000
iponversion loan was rather
Surprisingly successful, 80 p.c.
of maturing loans being con-
verted.
Now the Government is
offering a new cash loan of
£l5 million at 4% per cent, for
three years, 4} per cent, for six
years and 4| per cent, for 12
years.
The terms are the same as
for the conversion loan, with
the addition of the middle
option of six years, and they
are identical with the terms of
the National Government’s last
loan of £2O million.
In view of the Government’s
election undertaking to reduce
interest-rates, it could hardly
have offered more. But the
rates are trimmed fine when
compared with current market
yields of about £4 18s. per cent.
for three or six years and
nearly £5 per cent, for longer
periods.
Some investors will be
attracted by the opportunity
of obtaining death-duty stock,
which may be surrendered at
full face-value at any time in
payment of death-duties. This
concession is available only
with new loans.


concise, summary of his work by
“F.T.M.” That,'so far as it goes, is
perfectly satisfactory; and as for the
other 6199 entries—it is impossible to
imagine that there are not mistakes
which will have to be corrected in
future editions, but it is equally impos-
sible to imagine that Angus and
Robertson, with the extra checking they
have co-opted from research-workers
and the National Library in Canberra,
have not made every effort to make
the great work as reliable as it is
handsome. Its value to libraries, news-
papers and any institutions here
or overseas requiring comprehensive
information on Australia needs no
stressing; and it is also a most useful
and fascinating work for anybody to
have in the home.
Battles Long Ago
For anyone hoping never to have to
worry again about such wearying
matters as the battles of Crecy and
Poitiers, The Hurling Time, by Maurice
Collis (Faber), comes with the pleasant
surprise of finding that the new school-
marm is Marilyn Monroe.
The bare bones of battles one
learned in section (a), (b) and (c) are
here most engagingly dressed-up, their
political antecedents given with the
clarity of a developing novel, their
strategy and tactics brought home with
practical considerations.
Crecy, won by Edward 111, and
Poitiers, won by his son the Black
Prince, were both archers’ battles, for
instance. Heavily outnumbered, the
English bowmen, grown from child-
hood and so inimitable on the
Continent, broke the power of Euro-
pean cavalry. Shooting further, faster
and harder than French crossbowmen,
the English archer could average six
shots a minute, so that 3000 archers
could put 18,000 arrows in the air in
one minute; and at the Prince’s
Spanish battle of Najera he is calcu-
lated to have had 6000 bowmen—i.e.,
36,000 arrows-a-minute.
Nor did one quite realise the sig-
nificance of the banner, Oriflamme,
which French King John somewhat
foolishly unfurled at Poitiers; you had
to be pretty sure of winning when you
brought out that bit of red silk, because
it meant “No quarter”—and indeed
the Black Prince was very cutting about
it when he entertained the beaten King
John in his tent after the battle. And
if the English took no open reprisals
for Oriflamme circumstances went to
work for them. King John a hostage
in England, the power of the French
nobility so broken that they could not
keep order within their own domains,
the French towns and peasantry were
left undefended against corps of bandits
led by English condottiere captains
who remained in France after the Black
Prince’s victories.
So the peasants, “the Jacquerie,”
rose (1358), burned down castles and
did the most revolting and ingenious
things to knights and their ladies , . .
But here the most interesting thing is
the parallel between France’s revolting
peasantry and England’s Wat Tyler 23
years later.
At the height of their success 9000
Jacques were beaten back and
massacred by 200 defenders of the 900
French ladies sent for safety to Meaux.
Next, William Cale, leader of 4500
Jacques, was so foolish as to visit the
opposing King Carlos of Navarre under
armistice and without exacting
hostages. For firstly being no gentle-
man, and secondly being a fool, he
and his staff were seized; his leaderless
army was massacred (after which
20,000 peasants were hanged or
butchered), while Cale himself was
crowned with a red-hot tripod.
In the same way when Tyler, the
nine-days’ wonder (June 7-15, 1381),
left his up-to-20,000 men to swagger
across to the boy-king Richard’s little
party at Smithfield, he only had to wave
his hand and the royal group would
have been* pincushions to the rebels’
arrows. Drunk with success, Tyler
tried to engineer an incident, finally
striking a blow against Lord Mayor
Walworth, not knowing the mayor was
armed. Walworth forgot prudence and
stabbed Tyler twice. Tyler’s horse
carried him away from the group; but
even then when Tyler called to his men
to avenge him and fell off his horse,
half-dead, the rebel archers held their
fire—and then the decision of the young
king completed with a stroke of valor
and genius this almost incredible affair.
Richard walked his horse into the
arrows that were beginning to fall,
spoke to the rebels and led them into a
field to wait, like sheep, the coming of
the terrible Sir Robert Knollys and his
7000 archers and men-at-arms and the
apparition of Tyler’s head borne before
them on a pike by Lord Mayor
Walworth.
But if all that seems to prove some-
thing, what is one to make of the
further life and death of this decisive
young king—or has Shakspeare been
misleading us about Richard II? Collis,
who explains everything up to this
point very clearly, leaves this question
discreetly alone.
PELLEAS IN QUEENSLAND
The house on stilts, the stilts so high
Because they grew upon a hill,
And in the garden-valley I
Walked waiting, waited, searched until
I found myself a world to hide
And stood beneath a hanging tree
Where hidden from the moon / cried,
At least the weeping-fig loves me:
It shrouds me from the bright night’s
love;
It lets me lean upon its bark ;
Some touch of strength it lets me have;
It lets me own the world of dark.
But it could not free me from you,
For you were everywhere in me :
The frangipani scent, the dew,
The' thought of light—no need to see.
Then, somewhere, from the house, a
song;
A singing soft as scent it seemed.
From that high house, it could belong
To Melisande’s tower dreamed
In some true opera. So, my part
So clear I parted branches, found
The moon and, singing in my heart,
In Melisande’s hair I drowned.

Love and Idleness (Michael Joseph)
is a novel of contemporary English life.
Like Braine’s “Room at the Top” and
John Osborne’s plays, it is brash, viru-
lent and oversexed. There are, too,
other similarities: it is a first novel; the
author, Leslie Blight, is a young man
of marked talent; the matter is
decadent, near-hopeless and devoid of
the graces.
The title is apt except that, no doubt
for reasons of euphony, the nouns are
in the wrong order. The community,
reduced to aimlessness as well as idle-
ness, is composed of men and women
in a R.A.F. spares-depot in the Mid-
lands after the war. Goff Mason, the
central character, is an orderly, working
as a clerk, who, “like his fellows, goes
about the business of living almost
unconsciously.” With no purpose in
life, no interests and no sensibility, he
drifts into a desultory but passionate
affair with a W.A.A.F. switchboard-
operator whose possessiveness is
savage and, when he later goes out
with another girl, violent.
The dialogue is bawdy, esoteric and
authentic (Blight spent three years in
the R.A.F.), serving only as an impres-
sionistic background to Mason’s two
concurrent adventures, one inside, and
the other outside, the camp.
Strangely enough, the triangular
theme is the same as that of “Room
at the Top.” Out of weakness Goff
consorts with a woman he doesn’t love
—and doesn’t want to—whose natural
passion is all-consuming. Inevitably
he falls in love with another. Hell
knows no fury and there is trouble: in
the once instance suicide, and in the

BLUEY TRUSCOTT
by IVAN SOUTHALL
Bluey Truscott’s early days as a football hero and his struggles to master flying make an
exciting introduction to his legendary exploits as a member of 452 Squadron, the first
Australian Squadron to be formed in Britain, and 76 Squadron, which played a vital part
in halting the Japanese advance. Ivan Southall has few equals in describing the tense
and thrilling moments of air combat and his record of the close friendship between Bluey
and Irish ace Paddy Finucane is particularly moving. Illustrated with 16 pages of
photographs. 25/- (post 9d.)

Cats in the Belfry: Doreen Tovey
(Elek). Michael Joseph, unprece-
dentedly boosting another publisher’s
book, says in a foreword that this is the
funniest book about cats he has ever
read; and the tribute is well earned. Mrs.
Tovey and her husband kept Siamese
cats (to deal with the mice that ate a
hole in the bag of the vacuum-cleaner
and let all the dirt out on the living-
room floor); and the cats, if they were
not scaring the wits out of the neighbor-
ing farm-cats by wooing them in a
blaze of unbearable splendor, were
jumping on Mr. Tovey in the bath,
causing unspeakable damage to the
vases, or gorging thmselves sick on
cream-cakes. It is one of those down-
to-earth comedies of domestic disaster
which women often write so well, with
the cats, wonderfully described, as an
additional attraction.

Andrew Young—Prospect of a Poet:
edited by Leonard Clark (Hart-Davis).
Born in 1908, Canon Young is widely
known as a Nature-poet, and this
book consists of tributes to his writing
by 14 contributors, among whom are
John Betjeman, Richard Church, Viola
Meynell and the Bishop of Chichester.
There is a preface by John Masefield
and a tribute in verse by Edmund
Blunden. It makes a useful survey of
the work of a poet who, if lacking the
original force of Blunden or Robert
Frost, has, nevertheless, interpreted the
English countryside with genuine
sensitivity.

Merrily to the Grave: Kathleen Sully
(Peter Davies). A novel about people in
a Brighton boarding-house : one deserts
his wife, another drops dead in the
backyard, another turns the gas-taps
on in her bedroom. There is a youth
from the slums who says, “I could come
home in the dinner-hour,” and, in the
next sentence, “Yeah, her money don’t
seem to have done her much good.”
There is an obnoxious cat called Bertie-
boy and a drunken violinist who draws
his bow with “sensitive restraint.”
None of the people come vividly to
life, but the picture of the cheap
boarding-house is convincing.

Joseph Conrad and His Characters:
Richard Curie (Heinemann). Conrad
told Curie he was' “the best friend my
work has ever had”; but, beyond being
friendly, it is doubtful if this new study
does much to illuminate Conrad’s
novels. Curie’s method is to detach the
principal characters from the novels and
analyse them at length, which involves
him in a good deal of pointing-out the
obvious of Stevie in “The Secret
Agent,” for instance, he observes,
“Stevie was easily influenced to admire
whole-hcartedly....Any tale of cruelty
tended to make him inarticulate
which is commonplace to anyone who
has read the novel and of small interest
to anyone who hasn’t. The general
effect, with the recapitulation of the
plots, is rather like that of Lamb’s
“Tales from Shakspeare”—you want
to go away and read the originals: a
friendly enough service, after all.
The First Detectives: Belton Cobb
(Faber). From the formation of
London’s metropolitan police in 1829
to the organisation of the Detective
Department of 1842 (which became the
C.I.D. in 1877). It’s a running com-
mentary on the careers of the two first
Police Commissioners, Rowan the
military martinet, and Mayne the more
subtle barrister. Giving examples of
actual crimes, Cobb shows police-work
developing from hangings on mere
suspicion to more careful efforts to
collect evidence, these in turn growing
into deductive reasoning and an
appreciation of the value of circum-
stantial evidence. He shows Mayne,
persuaded of the need for a corps of
thinkers working apart from the law-
enforcing police, quietly working his
ideas upon the more practical Rowan,
until Rowan imagines he has thought
the same thing all along . . .
The Grey Stranger: Frances Crane
(Hammond). A Californian vigneron
dies after drinking a bottle of his spe-
ciai p i on k, and the Pat Abbotts, the
husband-and-wife investigators, con-
sider that more than the plonk is to
blame—and on the same night a baby-
sitter coming to sit with the Abbotts’
young is murdered and a sinister sub-
stitute sits-in for her. The investigation
concentrates on the vigneron’s family
and business - associates —he had
bought-up a lot of Californian vine-
yards during Prohibition, and the pre-
vious owners are suspected of having
it in for him. Not a bad mystery of
the not-a-bad-mystery class.

On a Balcony: David Stacton
(Faber). A reconstruction of Imperial
Egypt during Pharaoh Akhnaton’s rule
—the army (you get scarcely more than
a shadowy glimpse of it), the powerful
Amon religious sect, Pharaoh’s
relatives, sycophants and hangers-on.
Chiefly it traces Akhnaton’s attempts
to stamp-out the Amon and substitute
Aton, even to the extent of building a
special city and reigning there as a god.
Stacton’s power lies in his psychological
insight; his weakness is a tendency to
moralise.
