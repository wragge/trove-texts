They Never Change
“Punch” (26/7/’33) has an illustratio
of a clergyman saying to a half-naked
Mayfair flapper “I trust you enjoyed ou
bazaar?” “Oh, boy! Was it hot dog!
she grins. She is the congener of
Whyte-Melville hoyden; vulgarer, no
doubt, but neither better nor worse men
tally or morally, and destined in a few
years to resemble one of the scandalisec
matrons who haver in the background
of the drawing, as they do in the back
ground of all Whyte-Melville’s picture
of London society. People of every
generation are the same. The wickec
characters—and specifically (he women —
of the modernist novels which are de
nounced by the censorious as evil influ
ences are no wickeder than those drawi
by the Victorians ; the only real differ
ences are that they have fewer taboo
and use other idioms.
Here are two books in which the chie
characters are adventuresses. The ladie
are curiously alike under their skins, bu
one is a product of to-day and the other
is an Early Victorian. The Victorian
crashes in the last chapter, and the other
doesn’t, but the point is immaterial
Society took a pride in being intolerant of
its Becky Sharps in the first half of the
nineteenth century, so it is representa-
tional to show one being punished the
moment she was bowled out in that era
However, women of the sort carry the
seeds of ruin in their own natures in
every age. No matter what the position
of a true misfit may be at the end ol
a work of fiction, disaster is bound to
overtake her eventually, and every novel-
reader knows it.
Man-mad.
Glory Manchester, of Eric Hazelton’s
A Touch of the Sun (Cassell - ; Angus and
Robertson; 7s. 6d.), is a degenerate
placed in an environment which exacer-
bates her problems. She would have
gone wrong in London or anywhere else,
but not nearly so quickly as she does in
the Archipelago. Her husband is the
British Commissioner of Pontian, aged
43 ; she has been a Bright Young Thing:
“a gossip-column debutante translated to
the jungle.” Mr. Hazelton has a remark-
ably sharp eye and ear for this type.
He sets down the breathless babble which
she uses to express her wandering
thought-processes so realistically that you
can hear her voice ; describes her clothes
and what they mean to her with the
understanding of a milliner ; refers back
to her London experiences ; stresses the
futility of her well-meaning husband and
the narrow dulness of Pontian, and com-
bines it all to explain her disordered
emotional life. Pontian to a white
woman means life without end on a
liner in the Red Sea.
Her infatuation for the Eurasian youth,
Reutens, recalls a case in a psychopatho-
logical textbook. The mere sound of the
dusky charmer’s Yankeefied voice chee-
cheeing banalities over the telephone
causes her uncontrollable excitement.
A pause, and then he went on again. “Well,
how are you? Busy?”
The tumult in her breast was a terrified
agony, and her reply came out in little stac-
cato gasps.
She is determined to live with him
whatever the cost may be to both of
them, and she does ; but there is no pre-
tence of sentiment on either side. She
spends a good deal of their week together
discussing his girl. As they are about to
part she talks of his future movements.
“Where will you stay in Macassa? Oh, at
your home, of course. And Madeline will be
there part of the time, you said? She is taking
a holiday from her job, too. How sweet •
Give her my- love.”
The keynote of her character is an
Elizabethan freedom from inhibitions and
reticences, yet she has an eye for the
main chance. When she realises that her
future is threatened she turns to the cos-
mopolitan Bostock. who has large in*
terests in the Archipelago, sometimes
visits it and knows her set. She asks him
to take her away and keep her ; he goes
one better and marries her after her
divorce. It is one
of the weaknesses
of an otherwise
consistent study
of a social colony
in the tropics.
Bostock would
never have married her.
In the last few pages they are back at
Alexandra Point for a few days, and she
is running true to form, gazing with
muzzy admiration at a handsome young
man in the hotel. Her husband recog-
nises the symptoms.
“You’d better go off to bed, Glory. You’re
drunk again —‘awfully drunk”....
Sir Roger Bostock watched to see that she
could find her way out of the restaurant and
up to their suite without assistance.
The discerning reader will give her
another year of security and comfort —
with luck.
Foredoomed
Joseph Shearing, author of Album
Leaf (Heinemann ; 7s. 6d.), is interested
in a rarer and much more sinister kind
of female than poor Glory; one who
often develops into a dangerous criminal.
His “Forget-me-not,” which was re-
viewed on this Page last year, contained
a heroine who was, in nearly all respects,
the same person as the heroine of Album
Leaf.
Lavinia Pierrepoint, after being care-
fully brought up in England, goes as
companion to the wealthy Comtesse de
Montpaon, a widow with one daughter,
Louise. Lavinia is beautiful, strong in
mind and body, determined to wrest
from life all it has to offer in the way of
pleasure and luxury. She has got en-
gaged to a well-born but penniless subal-
tern before leaving England, but that
doesn’t prevent her from having a liaison
with her employer’s nephew, the Due de
Saint Paulle. The due poisons the com-
tesse and her daughter. Lavinia knows
in her heart, but it doesn’t lessen her
infatuation for the poisoner or her re-
solve to marry him, or, if he won’t marry
her, to live with him. What does affect
her is the discovery that he has been dis-
inherited by his aunt. Providentially, her
soldier-lover in England inherits a for-
tune and a baronetcy, and she returns to
marry him. Rumors reach England of
her doings in France, and the engage-
ment is broken off.
Back in the village from which she
started on her adventures she faces life
afresh, with new tastes and desires and
a little money, the proceeds of a legacy
from the comtesse. Brandy is her chief
requirement. It is in keeping with her
ingrained respect for appearances—a trait
which is to be found in most of Eng-
land’s best-known murderesses —that she
should take all sorts of precautions
against letting the villagers find out that
the brandy is for herself. She decides
not to buy any more in the village.
Never mind. She had enough to last her
until she returned to London, and then she
would be quite free and unspied upon; there
10 one would care what she did or what she
Decame.
Lavinia, like Glory, is left with the
tragic years of her life in front of her,
and they should be dreadful enough to
satisfy the most vindictive moralist.

“Cavalcade” and Film Publicity
A London cable mentioned, last week,
that “Angriff,” the organ of the German
Minister for Propaganda (Dr. Goebbels),
had condemned “Cavalcade” as “an
example of sentimental English pacifism.”
The Bulletin, alone in Australia, made
a similar comment when “Cavalcade” was
screened in Sydney. The critic of
“Angriff,” being a German, hasn’t got
Noel Coward’s satire in quite the right
perspective. Its sentimentalisms are palp-
able box-office interpolations; the mar-
tial airs and flag-wavings are cynically
compartmented from the main theme, like
the comic bits in “The Squatter’s Daugh-
ter.” But Mr. Coward, while anything
but sentimental, is certainly a propagand-
ist on behalf of pacifism or disarmament.
He would be false, otherwise, to the
convictions which he has expressed in
nearly all his writings. He belongs to a
derisive school, in which his alter ego
Beverley Nichols is prominent, whose
members are never tired of pillorying the
Briton of the old-fashioned Empire or

Take an edge so keen that words can’t
describe it —so smooth that it glides like
velvet over the tenderest skin. That’s the
new Seven o’clock blade—for all double-
edged razors. Try one. Did you know
that a safety razor shave could be so clean
and quick? Then remember that a shilling
and sixpence buys five of these amazing
blades. Every dealer sells Seven o’clock
razor blades. Get yours to-night.
DOUBLE EDGED
MADE IN ENGLAND
King’s Man type. They are so influential
in the London theatrical world that the
manly man has almost become a thing of
the past on the English stage. The Bul-
letin (again alone amongst Australian
papers) has been drawing attention for
years to the effeminate males of most
English films. By a coincidence an en-
dorsement of its views reached the writer
by the last London mail from W. H.
Kelly, ex-M.H.R., a staunch Imperialist.
Do you think it is much good shouting for
“British films for the British Empire” so long
as English producers can’t find a young actor
who doesn’t look as if lie regards the heroine
as a matter of extinct interest?
The bugbear of the modernists who are
foisting these ladylike lads on the Eng-
lish stage and screen is the pre-war era.
It stands for an idea they hate—Empire ;
Jingoism ; the menace that may land
them in a front-line trench if it isn’t
scotched in time. So, in “Cavalcade,” we
have the late-Victorian and Edwardian
(or Jingo) periods exhibited in contempt-
ible lights. The glorious English stage
of Irving, Ellen Terry, Tree, Charles
Hawtrey, Alexander, Bancroft, Wyndham
and many more is symbolised by a pre-
posterous musical comedy; the South
African War by “Mafficking” Night; the
heroisms and idealisms of the world war
by men dying in heaps while they envis-
age an inane girl yelling a recruiting song.
Yet Australian papers hailed this in-
genious special pleading against all that
Empire stands for in the average man’s
mind as “an epic of Empire” and “a
film which will do more for England than
the payment of the war debt”! It doesn’t
mean that Australian critics lack discern-
ment. Most of the British papers took
the same line. The explanation is that
the huge advertisements of the talkie
theatres are prostituting dramatic criti-
cism in the popular press throughout
the English-speaking world. The pheno-
menon is to be seen all over again in the
rapturous press receptions that are being
given here and in England to “The Good
Companions,” a mawkish, unreal, over-
acted and, by world-standards, outstand-
ingly feeble production.
The danger of the situation is that the
cinema represents the most powerful
crowd-influence in history. Under tyran-
nies such as that of Hitler sneers at sol-
diering and the spirit that prompts men
to offer their lives for their faith or
country can be swiftly dealt with ;
“Cavalcade” has no doubt been forbidden
in the Fatherland already. Under our
system the duty of interpreting stage,
screen or literary propaganda rests almost
entirely with the press. But news-
papers get huge movie advertisements on
an implied understanding that they will
only print bogus criticisms of important
films; adulation, varied, f<?r the sake
of appearances, by a few objections
to features that don’t matter. And the
trusting public rarely wakes up to what
is happening till it is too late.

An Author’s Plaint
I have published two books. I was
told that their success abroad was quite
remarkable, though the monetary confir-
mation was not of such a nature as to
make me rush out and buy a limousine.
Their success in Australia, I was informed,
was also stupendous. My proportion of
the six-and-sixpence per book was three-
pence. The threepence remained station-
ary when the price soared to eight-and-
six. When I made mild inquiries as to
this phenomenon I learned that it was one
of the mysteries of the book trade that no
author had the requisite intelligence to
grasp, and I was mollified with a wad of
favorable reviews of the second book that
had appeared in church magazines.
About (his time the broadcasting com-
panies started calling on me. They said
they were sure their listeners would be
delighted to hear my books and that I
would be delighted if they were delighted.
I said that 1 thought my books were
much better read than listened to. They
pointed out that if the books were broad-
cast millions of listeners would want to
buy them. The materialistic argument
appealed to me much more than the
moral one, and I consented. The books
were broadcast in bits or in their en-
tirety by several stations, but the con-
sequences to me were not such as to
make me think of buying the 40-ton
yacht, with auxiliary engine, that I have
coveted for so many years.
The other evening I was in a friend’s
house and the wireless was barking. The
announcer had a horrible voice, such as
even Dean Swift couldn’t have imagined
as coming from a human thorax, but the
words seemed familiar. After listening
for a few seconds I realised that one of
my books, though it may have disap-
peared from the bookshops, was still
going the rounds of the ether. I ascer-
tained that the station is in N.S.W.,
whereas I live in Victoria. Presumably
there are rules and regulations, beyond
the grasp of mere authors, allowing
broadcasting companies in other States
to use other people’s property without
payment or permission. If I wrote and
complained the N.S.W. people would pro-
bably say that they did it in the interests
of art. I don’t know how it is in N.S.W.,
but the entrepreneurs of the Victorian
ether take the same interest in art that
vultures take in caviare.

Poetry and Science
The fault in M. G. Skipper’s sermon on
the text from Professor Grant (B.
20/9/’33) is that he as well as the Pro-
fessor classifies poets and scientists into
mutually excluding compartments. Such
a division is rare. There are dehuman-
ised scientists and unpractical poets, but
neither are great or true in their class.
The greatest scientists are human beings
(avoiding the word “humanist”) and the
greatest poets, if not of a pronounced
scientific mentality, have been able to
grasp, and even to amplify and extend,
the principles of practically any discovery
or theory in science. Therein consists the
greatness of both. We know the poetic
appreciation of Havelock Ellis ; it is easy
to believe that Robert Bridges could have
sported with Relativity in the shade.
Leave the poets to themselves and
they will carry science further than the
scientists would or the poet in the
scientist will. The theory of the devout
and pious Newton and its soul-deadening
implications culminated in the hard,
materialistic thought of the latter part of
last century. From it many of the
branches of science turned, they knew
not whither, until the infidel’ Einstein
placed the emphasis on the individual
consciousness in the branch of science
(hat has always resisted the humanising
tendency most strongly. As a scientific
theory it has its critics, as Newton’s had
in a less critical day ; but its influence on
thought—or on life, which is thought—
will probably be as wide and as deep as
the influence of Newton’s was. And rarer
than the poet without appreciation of
science is the scientist without apprecia-
tion of poetry in life —without vision
and without a glimpse of that light “that
never was,” which, of course, he cannot
classify.
The mathematician who complained
that poetry was “unsatisfactory because
it proved nothing” is a caricature.
There is a singular non-didactic (“pure
art”) beauty in some of the higher mathe-
matical sequences even, to say nothing of
the branches of science in which an
evocation of emotion or taste is less sur-
prising. And before modern science
stated that pain and sensibility were pro-
portionate, there was scientific as well
as poetic truth in the first part of the
sixth canto of the third book of “The
Faerie Queene,” particularly in the 27th
stanza.
If it were not that we feel poetry to
be greater than science, as human beings
are greater than the “discoverable facts”
of Mr. Skipper’s old man, we would be
inclined to think them the same thing, as
the same old man said their aims were.
All of which depends on what is meant
and understood of “poetry” in inverted
commas, and of science without them.
P. K. BROWN.
A Satchel of Books
Photography Without Failures (Rout-
ledge ; Dymock’s ; 2s. 6d.). A textbook
for beginners. The author concentrates
on mistakes in exposure and focussing,
and shows how they may be avoided ;
and there are helpful chapters on nega-
tives and printing.
Bushland Broadcast is a charming book
for children ; and primarily for Austra-
lian children. Robertson and Mullens are
the publishers ; the prose and verse are
by Enid Prior ; and it has a number of
illustrations in line and color by Florence
Camm. The dramatis personce are chiefly
Australian animals, birds and fishes, and
they are all heroic with the exception of
Firemaker (whose machinations are de-
feated by Rainmaker) and a homicidal
butcher-bird. One of the book’s attrac-
tions is its freedom from pawkiness: any
adult can read it aloud without a qualm.
D. K. Broster’s Almond, Wild Almond
(Heinemann ; 7s. 6d.), is a tale of love
and adventure in the dark days that pre-
ceded and followed Culloden. Bride
Stewart, whose kinsmen wear the white
cockade, is the altogether delightful
heroine. One of the many heroes is the
Frenchman Marie-Cyprien de Lancize
(he is also one of those whose hearts
are won by Bride’s loveliness and charm),
and his last chivalrous action in Scot-
land is to save the life of the man
whom Bride loves and return him to her.
There isn’t a dull chapter in it, and a
map of the country between Pitlochry
and Fort William adds to the interest.
Country Party, by Viola Castang
(Cassell; Angus and Robertson ; 7s. 6d.),
is divided into three sections —morning,
afternoon and evening. It is the day of
Mrs. Maynard’s garden party. Against
this background you see poor old Mrs.
' Maynard, whose late husband was a
barber and who is still pining for him ;
Paula, her snobbish daughter ; Victoria,
who is refreshingly unsnobbish, and her
friend Noel ; Lady Menace and many
more. It gives a picture of English county
life which has been done before; but
it is brighter and wittier than many
previous models. The grim finish is
extremely effective.
Rosalie Vaun, though married no more
than a week to Colonel Ormiston, is on
the job again in J. M. Walsh’s The Secret
Service Girl (Collins; 7s. 6d.). As
Dolores Estramadura, she makes the
acquaintance of the adventurer Gary
Haddin, who has just been given a broad
hint by the authorities to get out of
Algeciras. Gary is there to interview the
infamous Sidi Mohammed Shabash, and
it was well that Rosalie met him when
she did. If she hadn’t an Imperial
calamity of the first magnitude might
have eventuated—nothing less than the
blowing-up of Gibraltar! Terry Vaun
and Isa, a beautiful member of the
Spanish Secret Service, discover their
love while the bullets are flying and
blood is flowing.
Up the Aerial, by Maurice Lane-Nor-
cott (Grayson; Dymock’s; 3s. 6d.), is
English nonsense at its best. Satire is
the essence of it. At a time when sus-
picions were beginning to haunt Mr.
Lane-Norcott that he was a failure in
life, someone sent him anonymously a
copy of Kipling’s “If.” He came to the
painful conclusion that he wasn’t a man
at all.
Finally, unable to bear the suspense any
longer, I sent the following prepaid telegram to
the author: —
Kipling Sussex Deeply regret inform you
cannot fill unforgiving minute with sixty seconds
duty done stop always lose head when those
around me lose theirs other feats mentioned by
you also beyond me stop what am I question
mark Puzzled Reader.
That is his form, and he maintains it
with unflagging high spirits through a
couple of dozen articles. The articles
and the drawings by Eric Fraser which
accompany them appeared originally in
the “Radio Times.”
Mr. J. Jay, by Frank Aid worth (Heine-
mann ; 7s. 6d.), is another of those
satires on life which are so devilishly
subtle that it takes a reader with the
brain of an Einstein to get an insight
into what the author objects to. Mr. J.
Jay (commonly referred to as J —) is
a half-wit who wanders about looking
for things he hasn’t lost. And so, at
last, they give him an office in which
he sits and signs photographs of him-
self as “The Seeker,” and there we leave
him, not without a sigh of relief. There
are thirty-four chapters of this deep-shal-
low stuff, but some are pleasingly brief;
one, in fact, covers less than half a
page.
We first meet sweet Rosalie Black-
wood, heroine of Anne Duffield’s Lan-
tern Light (Cassell; Dymock’s; 7s. 6d.),
taking a shorthand note in a stuffy Lon-
don solicitor’s office. What a contrast
to the life which she presently begins
to lead in China! The adopted son of a
Manchu prince falls desperately in love
with her. And she finds to her dismay,
ere long, that she loves Chian Yuen with
all the intensity of a virgin heart. Comes
the news that Chian is heir to the estates
of his real father —Sir James Sanderson,
of Scotland.
“So now,” said the Ta Jen, “there can be
no objection to your marrying the sweet
blossom Rosalie.”
Nor was there. Brightly written and
amusing in spots in spite of its lush
sentimentalism.
Jam To-day, by Rupert Latimer (Cas-
sell ; Angus and Robertson; 7s. 6d.).
Mrs. Chesterfield, wife of the R.A.,
steals Miss Amelia Forrest’s bicycle and
isosceles hat with cherries, and as a
result poor Miss Forrest has to share
a tandem bicycle with the R.A. and
arrive in Beechampton hatless. The
episode leads to various complications.
The story never gets a move on, the
chief reason being that it is continually
held up by the dialogue.
“After you, sir,” said Michael Wren, turn-
ing politely to Gerald Wise.
“Look here,” said Veronica crossly, “if
nobody plays this seriously it won’t lead us any-
where at all.”
“And we might as well play bridge,” said
somebody called Jim with a moustache.
“Yes, let’s play bridge,” said Mrs. Hudson.
“I think we’re all getting a little shy.”
“No, no!” screamed everybody who couldn’t
play bridge.
“No, no 1 ” shouted Veronica, turning fiercely
to Brenda. “Brenda, has Bonzo ever kissed
you?”
Brenda turned very red and said: “No!”
Everybody hooted with mirth.
If this kind of thing makes you hoot
with mirth, then read Jam To-day ; if
not, avoid it.

1893 AND 1933.
A remark in The Bulletin that “this
depression is passing, as the 1893 depres-
sion passed,” drew a choleric comment
from a young reader. “Fancy likening
a local slump like the 1893 one to a
world-wide catastrophe,” he wrote. Bui
the 1893 business was no mere local
slump. The critic, of course, did not live
through that period. The Bulletin did.
and it can recall experiences which were
harder on a multitude of Australians
than any suffered by the same class of
people since the latter part of 1929.
For one thing, most of the private
banks went bung, and many building
societies and the like along with them.
There has been no corresponding calam-
ity this time, except in the case of a
Government institution controlled, as the
event proved, by bad politicians—the
depositors had been assured that it was
free from political control.
The associated banks learhed the les-
son which 1893 taught. They warned
Australia that it was borrowing far too
much and living too high, and were dis-
missed as calamity-howlers. During the
depression they have been a tower of
strength to the nation. It is easy to
rail at them for making profits and re-
fusing overdrafts and being reluctant to
reduce interest-rates while taxes were
sky-high. In one quarter there has been
too great a tendency to assume that a
policy that would suit the particular in-
terests of a bank’s shareholders and cus-
tomers must be the right policy for the
Commonwealth. And there have been
too many representatives of banks
at Premiers’ conferences. But it should
always be remembered that these banks
kept their doors open and aided the
nation when it most needed their aid—
were assets to it when the N. S. Wales
Government Savings Bank became a
liability. And now that the worst is over
they remain able and willing to help it
out of a situation for which politicians
who would “nationalise” them and
“socialise credit” are very largely re-
sponsible. It is a great deal more than
can be said for many of the American
banks.
The 1893 blizzard also struck the
U.S.A., and the effects in that country
lasted several years. History never re-
peats itself exactly, but things which are
happening and expressions which are
being applied to them in Roosevelt’s
Republic must seem drearily familiar to
Americans who can remember Cleve-
land’s second Presidency. In February,
1893, as a representative historian, P. L.
Haworth, puts it:
A stock panic shook the exchanges. Many
western silver-mines closed. People began to
hoard gold, prices of agricultural products
(already excessively low) continued to decline,
and a chain of nearly 50 western banks,
founded by a certain Zimri Dwiggins, went
down in one grand crash. During the year
hundreds of banks failed, the total liabilities of
mercantile failures amounted to $347,000,000,
railway construction almost ceased, 22,500 miles
passed into the hands of receivers and ruin
came to many thousands of toiling people.
In 1893, as in 1930, ’3l, ’32 and ’33,
“all sorts of remedies, sensible and other-
wise, were proposed to meet the emer-
gency” ; but the emergency went on.
“The year 1894 surpassed any other in
the history of the U.S.A. in the number
of workers out of employment.” That
was the year of Coxey’s army. Coxey,
“an agitator,” led a band of unemployed
from Ohio to Washington to demand that
“Congress should pass a good-roads law
and a non-interest-bearing bond law,
and thereby furnish work for the needy,
and expand the monetary system.” Re-
duction of railwaymen’s wages led to a
great strike, during which a Federal
Judge issued a “blanket” injunction for-
bidding the strike leaders to interfere
with the transport of mails and passage
of inter-State commerce.
The gold standard was denounced.
Britain was to blame for it, so Britain
became the popular scapegoat, just as
the banks are here and now. Major
Douglas had not arrived, but a short cut
was discovered. The demand for the free
coinage of silver “became a fanaticism
like the Crusades.” Especially in 1895,
when “tens of millions continued to feel
the pinch of hard times,” when “farmers
could not sell their wheat and corn, their
hogs and cattle, for enough to meet ex-
penses and pay the interest on the mort-
gage.” A bimetallist speech made Bryan,
previously obscure, a candidate for the
Presidency. “You shall not press down
upon the brow of labor,” he said, “this
crown of thorns ; you shall not crucify
mankind upon a cross of gold.”
Unfortunately for Bryan, gold had
been found in the Yukon region. The
developments there, while helping to dish
the young man from Nebraska and con-
tributing to the national recovery, did
not shorten the U.S.A. depression and
cushion the shock while it lasted, as the
gold discoveries in Westralia undoubtedly
did here. By a very fortunate coin-
cidence Kalgoorlie was pioneered in the
very year of the bank smashes and the
bursting of the Victorian land boom. A
corresponding gleam has shot through
the darkness of the present depression.
Another Kalgoorlie has not been found,
but the premium on gold has had much
the same effect.
The 1893-94 finds had important poli-
tical, as well as economic, consequences.
Forty or fifty thousand easterners,
mostly Victorians, and nearly all adults,
found their way to the Westralian
goldfields. Their influence forced a
reluctant Swan River Ministry to sub-
mit the Constitution Bill to the
people, and their vote carried Westralia
into the Commonwealth. Thanks to the
gold premium, so many men have
trooped back into the mines that the
goldfields, whose influence in Westralian
affairs waned after 1903, have regained
their political prominence. They de-
clared against the Perth campaign for
secession when it was put* to the
vote, and they can be depended upon to
keep Westralia in the Commonwealth.
Depressions are evidently the effects of
some form of madness which affects a
great many members of the human
family about the same time. They are
of all sizes: great, small and betwixt-
and-between. Haworth’s notion is that
“hard times follow flush times, as the
trough of the sea follows the crest of the
wave.” His remarks on the periodicity
of depressions in the U.S.A. are singu-
larly interesting, especially considering
that he wrote his book in 1919 and did
not set up for being a prophet:
Tn the U.S.A. periods of great depression
have come about every twenty years. There
were such depressions in 1819, 1837, 1857,
1873, 1893 and 1913-14.
The present visitation is the most disas-
trous on record because the nations
indulged for four years (prolonged, in
some cases, to five years and more) in
the costliest form of madness, war, and
then plunged into materialism and the
pursuit of pleasure; and because the
world is much more interdependent than
it used to be. In our case the effects
have been accentuated by crazy public
borrowing for works and land resump-
tions and so forth which regularly failed
to yield the interest. But depressions
run their course, as pestilences do.
When they extend over long periods the
second year is generally the worst; the
fourth year witnesses the end, or the
beginning of the end.
BUDGET AND CO-OPERATION.
After Mr. Lyons’s Budget speech, not
even the rudest newspaper can call him
a wooden man. He is pure rubber, built
to bend to expediency. His Government
has framed its financial proposals for a
year that may bring a general election
(if it doesn’t, the next year will) with an
eye on interests which have been threaten-
ing withdrawal of support failing conces-
sions, as well as those which have been
pleading for relief from crushing burdens.
His Budget has been praised for its cour-
age. It is such courage as small deer
show when driven into a corner.
There had to be reduction of taxes,
since it was impossible for industry, bur-
dened as it has been, to materially in-
crease employment, and £7,400,000 or so
is to be cut off imposts, direct and in-
direct. A little more than a third of the
easing is represented by income-tax reduc-
tion. The rates on personal earnings, which
are lower than the property rates, are
down 15 per cent. Company tax is re-
duced from Is. 4.8 d. to Is. in the £, and
the special property tax of 2s. in the £
is halved. Land tax is whittled another
16 2-3 per cent. Good advertisers in the
press which put Mr. Lyons where he is
are freed entirely of entertainments tax.
The balance of the cuts consists of
£2,570,000 in sales tax and £1,760,000 in
customs, excise and primage. On the
other hand there is to be increased expen-
diture, especially on old-age and invalid
pensioners and civil servants, who, of
course, control heaps of votes.
While, with Stevens’s effort and some
minor reductions in other States,
£12,000,000 is to be taken off the Aus-
tralian taxpayers’ shoulders, it is not
enough. Mr. Lyons has not risen to the
occasion. A statesman would have done
the job thoroughly.
Even assuming that there is no buoy-
ancy—and there must be—from tax
relief, this year’s Commonwealth collec-
tions will yield more than the amount
taken from the taxpayers during boom
years, while some of the taxes which have
only been pruned have a cumulative
effect which no taxes ever before in vogue
have had. Sales tax, for instance, applied
at 6 per cent, at production point; ex-
pands to 11 per cent, at consumer
point; and what the ultimate burden of
the State wages taxes imposes on spend-
ing, Heaven alone knows. Certain it is
that when the coming year’s receipts are
viewed in relation to production they re-
present a heavier burden, even taken at
their face value, than a similar amount
collected in a year of prosperity like 1929.
Then the Commonwealth and States
took 19 per cent, of a production valued
at £447,000,000. But in 1931-32 they
took 28.9 per cent, of production value,
and it would have been considerably
more but for suspension of overseas war-
loan payments.
Just before the delivery of the Budget
speech Dr. Earle Page put forward his
scheme for tax-reduction. His attitude
was such that Mr. Lyons would have
done the right thing had he held back his
Budget for a few days while he and the
Country party leaders got together. He
should have made an effort to see
whether party agreement could not have
been achieved. Dr. Page made a peace
overture. He agreed in principle with
Lyons’s plan ; but he wishes to go fur-
ther. He wants at least £20,000,000 off
Australian taxation, and thinks he can
see ways of getting it off which will
obviate borrowing.
He declared that reduction of taxes to
make employment was “essentially one
for co-operative effort among all sections
of the community ; between Common-
wealth and States, and between party and
party”; he added:
The U.C.P. is prepared to co-operate in
every possible way with every Government and
with every section that will participate in such
co-operative drive to increase jobs and enhance
purchasing-power. If anyone can suggest better
means, the U.C.P. will back them.
More especially as the C.P. chief went
out of his way to acknowledge the
importance of the manufacturing interest
and to make it clear that his tariff policy
was aimed only at abolition of primage
and reduction of revenue duties, such
a speech seemed a sound base from
which to initiate a policy of co-plan-
ning. Next morning, however, U.A.P.
newspapers asserted that the Metro-
politan Conference of the U.C.P. in
Sydney had talked of running a man for
Flinders, and had “resolved” that unless
the U.A.P. “assumed a more con-
ciliatory attitude, every country elector-
ate in Australia would be contested by a
U.C.P. candidate.” Both statements have
since been characterised by the U.C.P. as
inventions; neither matter was discussed.
It is time that manoeuvring on behalf
of individuals with political skins to save
ceased. Ninety p.c. of work is given by
private employers. The Commonwealth
and State Governments have it in their
power to place employers in a position
to put 100,000 men back in the jobs
which they have been trained to do, and
to bring capital pouring into the country
by making Australia one of the lowest-
taxed parts of the British Empire instead
of the highest-taxed.
It is a task worth getting co-operation
for ; a task to which the brains of all
politicians not wild or mad should be
applied in unison.
Mr. Lyons has shelved Bruce, who
could have achieved unity. If the price
of the retention of Mr. Lyons himself
is to be continual bickering with the
U.A.P.’s natural allies, it is too much
for Australia to pay. An insecure
Administration, gesturing with feeble
window-dressing schemes that only go
half-way to the real objective, is only too
likely to lead to an early election and
a long, sorry, harrowing dose of a mixed
Lang-Scullin regime which may make
the last adventure with the bright pair
look like a picnic in spring.
ADDRESS TO THE KING.
At the request of a joint select com-
mittee, the Perth Parliament has ap-
pointed another committee “to prepare a
dutiful address to his Majesty” and
“humble applications to both Houses of
the Imperial Parliament” in furtherance
of the case for secession. Premier Col-
lier, who has a sly humor, placed
ex-Premier Scaddan, his chief for seven
years or thereabouts and his opponent
for 17, on the second committee, and
what seems to be a rough draft of “the
dutiful address” has come into the hands
of an agent of the Oppressor.
The Hon. John Scaddan, with his humble duty
to your Majesty. When in the course of
human events it becomes necessary for one
people to separate from another, a decent atten-
tion to the opinion of mankind requires it
to to
Blast it, someone has pinched my copy of the
Declaration of Independence, and I can’t make
the rest up out of my head. It’s not my style,
anyhow. 1 am a free and frank Australian —
1 mean Westralian—l am. Suppose I address
you as one bloke to another? Right!
How have you been getting on all these years?
You remember me, of course. When you spoke
in King’s Park, Perth, in 1901, after opening
the first Commonwealth Parliament (curse it!).
I was the boy who stood on the outskirts of
the crowd and made a noise like a crab. Ha!
Ha! We met again in 1913—1 think that was
the year. Anyway, I was Premier, and 1 was
visiting England, and under my masterly direc-
tion of the finances our deficit had passed the
million mark, and my subjects nicknamed me
“Gone-a-million Jack.”
I called on you at Buckingham Palace, and,
as you will recollect, the breeches I hired were
infernally baggy, and my sword kept getting in
the way of my legs. But I flatter myself I
Carried it off well. Much better than one of
my predecessors, who took me along. Nam-
ing no names, of course. As you would say,
always the gentleman, what? But didn’t he
look like a stuffed pig?
We’ve had many experiences since then, you
and I. I come from Moonta, as you know,
but I have been a Westralian since the days
when my favorite diversion was to chuck a
chunk of cotton-waste soaked in oil at unsuspect-
ing visitors to the engine-room, and I am out to
cast off the yoke of the Federal Octopus. It
oppresses us fearfully. It would take me days
to write down all the frightful things it does,
but here is one.
Revenue from all our State taxes is estimated
this year at £1,382,000. From the Federal
Octopus we are getting a measly £1,073,400.
Suppose England were part of a Federation
which included half the countries in Europe,
and suppose it raised, say, 55 p.c. by local
taxes for current expenses, and received the
other 45 p.c. from half the countries in Europe.
Wouldn’t it be terrible for you English? Well,
that’s what we have to stand from the Octopus.
Another thing. The Octopus built a railway
to connect Perth with its own dens of infamy.
The railway cost ten million, more or less, and
loses about £300,000 a year, which the Octopus
has to pay. What do you think that Octopus
is doing now? Actually sending beer across
the railway to the men on the Golden Mile
instead of letting them slake their thirst
in Swan stingo. I could go on in this way for
columns, as I have said, but I don’t want to
worry the soul-case out of you. I tell you,
George, we won’t stand it; we’ll rise first.
We have some wonderful fighters on the
executive of our Secession League. There’s
Alf Chandler, the chairman, who’s 82, and ex-
Mayor Franklin, who’s 81, I think —anyway, I
know he is in the 80’s —and Norb Keenan and
McCallum Smith and Noel Brazier—all in their
60’s and spoiling for a chance to get at the
Octopus and tear it tentacle from tentacle.
Then there is Paddy Lynch, who as a Westralian
member is breaking his neck to dance on the
Octopus’s chest, and as President of the Senate
is committed to support the Octopus in all its
nefarious practices. Some people might con-
sider this dual position embarrassing, but it is
congenial to Paddy—it enables him, in a manner
of speaking, to be in two fights at once.
Another secessionist with blood in his eye is
Comrade Kenneally. He is also a unification-
ist—which, as you might say, is equivalent to
being a vegetarian with a lingering prejudice in
favor of three helpings of corned beef with the
carrots —and he’s chairman of the Federal
A.L.P., which goes every few months to Sydney
to hold unity conferences with the Lang A.L.P.
There’s so much unity about those lads thht
they have to be kept apart by the police.
Walter James, too. As a delegate to the.
1897 Federal Convention, he helped to create
the Octopus; but that is neither here nor there.
At 37 he said Westralia would be false to the
grand old traditions of the race if it stayed out
of the Commonwealth; at 70 he says it will be
false to them if it stays in. You will recall
Walter; he was Agent-General in your city
about 25 years ago. He has never grown up
and he will always have his joke.
I have written enough to show you how
ground-down and enslaved and poverty-stricken
we are. (By the way, did you buy Wilunas
when they were sixteen bob? They are sixty-six
now. The Octopus guaranteed a loan of £300,000
to the company, be hanged to it!). And now I
want you to be easy in your mind about this
rebellion of ours. When we unfurl the flag
to the breeze and call upon the insulting foe
to come on, you’ll be as right as pie. Give us
Liberty or give us Death, Chandler and Frank-
lin and McCallum Smith and Walter James
and Paddy Lynch and Kenneally and me, but
you go on having your four meals a day and
sleeping soundly in your bed.
It must be a grand thing to be a king like
you. I daresay the insurance companies charge
high premiums on European kings in their
workers’-compensation and endowment policies:
but you’re all right. And you’re independent of
parties, organisations, general elections, and all
that sort of thing. It is different with me.
I have been rocketing from party to party
these last 17 years, and losing my seat as often
as not. A Labor man, then Labor Independ-
ent, then Country party, then Nationalist, then
U.A.P.; and out on my pink ear last March
because, to oblige the daily papers, I inter-
fered with the weekly papers’ crosswords com-
petitions, and the weeklies got to me. I’m
tired of it all, I tell you straight.
Think you could find me a nice little king-
dom? Set me up in a palace with £5OOO a
year and a chamberlain, court ladies, musicians
—I have a taste for music, although I plav
nothing but the pianola—and a bodyguard?
I would prefer an island. The Isle of Man
would do, or the Isle of Wight, or, better still,
Rottnest. Duties to consist mostly of signing
the monthly receipt for my salary, and prowl-
ing about the beaches to see that the girls don’t
take too much off back and front. Bare legs
don’t matter —you and I, being men of the
world, are inured to legs.
Well. I must go and practise bomb-throwing
in the backyard. So long, and look after your-
self, and don’t forget to fit me out with a snug
little island and a crown.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Hearst Supports Hughes.
With the assistance of our moving-
picture press W. R. Hearst, the American
newspaper proprietor, has dashed into the
Australian Defence controversy as an
advocate for the programme of W. M.
Hughes.
During the Great War these interest-
ing persons were on bad terms. So much
so that William Morris refused admis-
sion to William Randolph’s newspapers.
Now William Randolph poses as a lov-
ing brother of the British Empire—he
has bought a castle in Wales—and is
anxious to send the U.S.A. battleships
across the Pacific once more as a gesture
of brotherhood and goodwill to Aus-
tralia.
Mr. Hearst is one of those persons
who must hate someone and some coun-
try. Britain, his aversion for so many
years, has been succeeded as a target for
his venom by Japan. One of his movie
newsreels in Sydney introduces itself
with the announcement that Japan has
decided on “a huge naval programme”
of battleships and every kind of craft—-
38 ships to cost 190 million dollars.; that
it intends to “build at once to the full
limit of the London Naval Treaty of
1930.” Then the Mikado is shown re-
viewing his fleet, which seems to consist
mainly of immense battleships—they
have been trick-photographed to make
them look about twice the size of H.M.S.
Hood. The inference, of course, is that
Nippon’s building programme involves
ships of this type.
The facts are that, of the 38 ships in-
volved, the four biggest are cruisers of
8590 tons ; of the rest, 17 are destroyers
and torpedo boats, and nine are sub-
marines. Most of them were already on
the stocks in February. What Mr. Hearst
does not mention is that the U.S.A. has
six cruisers building and more contem-
plated, as well as destroyers and small
craft and a modernising programme for
most of its big ships, while Britain in
February had 10 cruisers, three flotilla-
leaders, 16 destroyers, 13 sloops and 10
submarines either building or on order.
Mr. Hearst is preaching “defensive
alliances” at the moment. “Defen-
sive alliances” and the waving, in
goodwill, of 16-inch guns may be dan-
gerous. Australia would welcome a
visit from U.S.A. battleships, as always ;
but it would rather they came at the in-
stance of a Roosevelt or a Hoover than
as a result of a Hearst newspaper stunt.

Primage and Exchange.
Primage and exchange have had effects
not contemplated by the many authors
of the customs tariff proper. They have
made some duties virtually prohibitive
and materially weakened the protective
incidence of others, where raw materials
have to be imported. At Ottawa the
Australian Government undertook “to
reduce or remove primage on British
goods as soon as the finances will
allow” ; and the Tariff Board recently
recommended that it should be removed
from items protected in the tariff schedule
and raw materials imported for Aus-
tralian factories.
Being naturally inclined to half-meas-
ures, the Government has decided that
it can’t go that far. Its Minister of Cus-
toms, while admitting that “primage was
intended as a revenue duty,” protests
that it is “protective in its incidence in
respect of goods to which protective
duties apply” ; though surely it would be
simpler and better to add the primage
rate to duties insufficiently protective in-
stead of having two sets of imposts, add-
ing a clumsy revenue tariff to one de-
signed to be protective. Primage is to
remain, except in the cases of tea, hes-
sian and jute goods, soda ash, certain
machines, tools and “minor articles for
use in the development of Australian
industry” ; also donkeys, poultry and
paintings by Australian artists.
“On goods covered by protective items”
where British preference applies, 819
altogether, it has been reduced from 10
p.c. to 5 p.c.; on a small list of raw
materials (such as straw for hats, dyes,
tinplate, cotton and silk yarns) the re-
duction is the same; on another small
list, which includes gelignite and aero-
plane parts, the duty comes down to 4
p.c. The general idea is to remit 12£
per cent, of the primage revenue,
£4,650,000, collected last year; and it is
not nearly enough.
The Government was accused by Sena-
tor Hardy of having suppressed the
Tariff Board’s report on exchange in
relation to the tariff out of regard for
the manufacturers. This Mr. White indig-
nantly denies ; publication, it seems, was
delayed to admit of the Government
giving deep thought to “this vexed and
exceedingly difficult and highly contro-
versial subject”—which of course it is.
The Tariff Board’s main recommen-
dations have been accepted. These are
that, while the Australia-U.K. rate re-
mains at 25 p.c., importers of goods to
which British preference applies should
be allowed a deduction of one-fourth
of the duty or one-eighth of the value
for duty, whichever is the less, the con-
cessions to be halved should the rate fall
below 20 per cent., but not below 12-j
per cent. The effect will be to increase
British preference on 839 tariff items, in
most cases from 10 to 20 per cent. On
goods from countries not in the Empire
there is to be no deduction for exchange.
This is a very substantial concession
to J. Bull, and it is to be hoped that
his bondholders and importers will
reciprocate. Certain of the latter —notice-
ably dealers in limber and butter—are
showing precious little of that Ottawa
spirit.
4
Five-year Parliaments.
After a lot of wrangling the Quinquen-
nial Parliament Bill has been passed in
South Aus., the Assembly having
accepted an amendment which limits the
five-year term to the present Parliament.
Now Butler announces that in the last
session he will introduce a bill to pro-
vide for the permanent incorporation of
the new principle, so that the electors
may give a mandate.
Butler and his friends have got what
they immediately wanted without a man-
date. Regarding his gleeful promise, as
Lacey, the titular Opposition leader, re-
marked, he may not be there to keep
it when the time comes.
The new measure is far worse than
the old. It establishes not merely the
one bad principle that Constitutions may
be jockeyed about without mandates
being given ; but also that from now on-
wards nobody in South Aus. will know
exactly what term Parliament has been
elected for.
In future, when a Government, still
with a majority in both Houses, feels
itself tottering, it will be justified, if
Butler is right, in extending its own
life for 10 or 20 years or 25 years,
as the case may be —the period will be-
come longer as politicians become bolder.
Then when that Government dies off the
next will open the session by electing
itself for life. After that it will only be
a short step towards introducing the
hereditary principle.
Butler’s measure is the most damaging
blow which has been dealt in recent
years at accepted Australian Constitu-
tional theories.

No Relief.
Forgan Smith had poor luck with his
Budget. It was issued at the same time
as Lyons’s, and a few days after Stevens
had set an example in tax-cutting. The
heading “No Relief from Taxation”
looked bad in Brisbane’s morning paper
alongside the even bigger one which con-
veyed, in figures, the moderately good
news from Canberra.
Forgan Smith anticipates a deficit of
£1,848,402 for 1933-34. He has budgeted
for receipts at £13,202,935, which is
£94,300 less than last year, and for ex-
penditure from consolidated revenue of
£15,051,000 —a quarter of a million more
than last year.
Seeing that the Labor Premier pro-
poses to fund £3,806,000 in accumulated
deficits and add the amount to the State
public debt, which was increased by
£2,619,000 last year, and that his loan
programme will call for £3,300,000,
£1,112,000 more than last year (though,
of course, the Commonwealth anted up
£940,000 in 1932-33 in addition), he has
nothing to be proud of.
While unemployed-relief (£1,711,111)
cost £570,437 more than the previous
year, it is proposed this year to resume
increases in civil servants’ salaries.
Farmers and graziers, the commercial
section and salary-earners will have no
relief, and the results are evident in anti-
cipations. Income and land taxes are ex-
pected to yield, between them, £201,000
less than in 1932-33, despite higher wool
prices and a generally better outlook.
No section of the community needs
more help in tax-relief at the moment
than the western Queensland wool- and
cattle-growers. The cattlemen have been
through a long and blistering drought.
The sheepmen are in such a bad wav
that even current prices are not payable
to them. Only a few weeks ago the
Queensland Land Administration Board
insisted that lessees on some of the best
subdivided country in Australia must
have larger areas in order to make a
living at all.
Yet civil servants who have had living-
wage salaries through the depression
when every selection west of the Divid-
ing Range was working at a loss have
first preference when it comes to giving
Budget relief. They, of course, are organ-
ised in Labor-unions and graziers or
manufacturers are not.

Three-eighths of a Penny.
There are a few morsels for Bung in
the Commonwealth Budget, and they
seem to have taken that person by sur-
prise. He is so used to being kicked by
politicians who are all for the good of
the greatest number (with votes) that to
have flung at him even a bone with the
merest scrap of meat on it comes as a
pleasant shock.
During the last 16 or 17 years Aus-
tralian hotelkeepers have had to submit
to heavily increased license fees, pro-
digious customs and excise duties on
alcoholic drinks, statutory reduction of
trading hours (in most cities and towns
they have to close their bars at six
o’clock, which in summertime is only
afternoon), periodical prohibition polls
and —in the last year or so —the competi-
tion of cruising steamers exempt from
the State licensing laws as well as the
Commonwealth Navigation Act. They
have also been obliged to contribute
heavily to compensation funds, intended
for owners and licensees put out of busi-
ness by prohibition, local option or
licensing court —only to see them looted
by needy State Governments.
Customs duties on spirituous and fer-
mented liquors have been 455. a proof
gallon on Scotch whisky, 465. on French
brandy, 475. on Hollands gin and 3s. 3d.
a gallon on bottled beer and stout from
the British Isles. Excise duties have been
2s. a gallon on beer and porter, 28s. a
proof gallon on brandy and whisky, 30s.
on pure rum, gin and liqueurs, and 31s.
on blended rum. No pretence was made
that these duties were protective. “The
only reason for their existence,” the
Minister of Customs says, “is to raise
the maximum possible revenue” ; and in
the same spirit he is reducing them, hav-
ing been told —though he plainly doubts
it—that “the duties have for some time
exceeded the point of maximum revenue
return.” He is taking ss. a proof
gallon off imported spirits, 2s. 6d. off
spirit for fortifying Australian wine (this
in the hope that growers will get more
for their grapes), 2s. off Australian spirits,
and 3d. a gallon off ale and porter,
Australian and imported.
A reduction of ss. a proof gallon on
spirits sold by the nip or by the 26- or
13-ounce bottle is not so bad. The public
will get some benefit from that. But
what’s the good of 3d. a gallon off beer,
sold by the pint, half-pint or “long
sleever,” with beer the price it has been?
Ninepence a pint in Sydney front bars,
and more elsewhere ; and the benevolent
Government takes three-eighths of a
penny off! It is ridiculous. The cut
should be Bd. a gallon at least.

The Country’s Wings.
Pearce’s scheme for adding to the Air
Force is spectacular but inadequate. A
“squadron” of 18 seaplanes and a
“squadron” of 18 landplanes—the latter
Bristol Bulldog fighters—are to be added
to the existing job lot of pterodactyls
which “defend” us, and some of which
would arouse the covetousness of any
enemy. Most countries these days have
museums, and every contribution is wel-
come.
No air programme of defence for Aus-
tralia is any good which does not pro-
vide for the training of fliers, squadrons
of them —men who know the country
and who understand fast, modern
machines and engines and “blind” work.
Such men can be provided only by inten-
sive experience ; and experience cannot
be obtained here while civil flying is
firmly suppressed by State Railway De-
partments lest aeroplanes rob their obso-
lete systems of a few shillings in revenue.
As The Bulletin pointed out the other
day, the man who buys a ’plane and
starts commercially to fly to and from
Bathurst across the Blue Mountains,
thus gaining invaluable training for mili-
tary purposes—since the mountains are
an important defensive barrier and their
air conditions tricky to the stranger —is
fined for his pains by the transport autho-
rities 2jd. per passenger per mile.
Pearce’s Air Force is neither here nor
there. Even assuming that all the exist-
ing museum pieces are retained, they
will only bring us to an air strength
approaching that of Siam. But two or
■three thousand pilots trained in the use
of fast machines would be another
matter, especially if we had ample fast
civilian machines of passenger types.
Speed is a factor which must count
in determining the usefulness of Aus-
tralian machines in time of war, as well
as in commerce. Our distances de-
mand it.
The Government should use every
effort to extend commercial air services
and (a) subsidise latest types of machines
or give preference in route licenses
to them ; (b) specially subsidise machines
which are dual-purpose—which would be
of use in wartime ; (c) insist as part of
the conditions of issue of commercial
air pilots’ licenses that the holders should
have undergone a course upon which to
base a military or naval air training;
(d) extend the air training in the Citizen
Forces.
The air is one place in which we can
look after ourselves if given a chance.
No country has produced so many aces
as Australia.

Perils of a Priminister.
London “Observer,” which prides itself
on its exact knowledge of affairs, has at
last placed the trials of the Australian
Prime Minister in their true perspective
in an article from a correspondent
headed “Blue Shirts in Australia —
Farmers’ Threat to Government.”
“Seldom in the history of the Com-
monwealth,” it seems, “has a Prime Min-
ister been so insulted” as was Mr. Lyons
by the Sydney deputation that “ ‘de-
manded’ immediate suspension of the
Ottawa agreements, complete withdrawal
of present tariffs and substitution of the
1921 tariff”! F. H. Tout will be glad
to hear that the “language used was in-
solent to a degree.” He and his friends
“refused to accept the P.M.’s assurances,
and demanded a reply from him within
a week.”
During the same week woolgrowers
had said they would not pay Government
charges, and the “president of the
Farmers and Settlers’ Association” had
“threatened to put his members into Blue
Shirts and take militant action.”
It is good news, however, to hear that
the Government has definitely refused to be
terrorised The financial year, ended in June,
provided £4,200,000 for the producers, who also
received an exchange benefit of £22,000,000.
The Government’s help to producers has pre-
vented any notable tax relief for people gener-
ally, and if the Lyons Ministry gives way to
them again its hopes of re-election nine months
hence will be small.
If it hadn’t come from Canberra, the
screed might be attributed to the war
correspondent accompanying General
O’Duffy. Still, the tip that the election
will be “nine months hence” may be
useful to somebody.

“Sock the Soldier!”
Lt.-Col. E. J. Munro voiced a military
grievance of long standing when he took
the Commonwealth Government to task
for staffing the Defence Department with
civilian clerks, one of whom gets a higher
salary than was paid to Brudenell White
or Chauvel, or is paid to Bruche. He
urged the necessity for employing en-
listed soldiers in these billets, since they
would be subject to discipline and cap-
able of better organisation and efficiency
than a similar number of civilians with-
out special knowledge or training.
This system is followed wherever pos-
sible in the British Army. Clerks and
ordnance storemen are invariably enlisted
men. They work as military units, and
are available wherever or whenever
called on. Under our hotch-potch
methods, the civilian element, with its
rigidly-followed schedule of fixed work-
ing hours and days, sometimes throws
the whole machine out of gear, to the
disgust and inconvenience of the mili-
tary section. “Ordnance stores,” com-
ments Munro pithily, “are always closed
on Saturdays, even while camps are in
progress.”
The story of the treatment of the sol-
diers’ side of the Defence Department
has been one of callous opportunism
since the war. When the Scullidores
came in soldiers were the first to be
“rationed”; clerks were exempt. Pay
cuts followed, and these “economies”
fell heavily on the lower ranks, especi-
ally on the highly-trained and efficient
w.-os. and n.c.os. of the Instructional
Staff. Yet by their personal influence
over the trainees, they it was, above all,
who saved what remained of the army
when the wretched pacifist Government
abandoned compulsory training, declar-
ing that Australia would be safe in
trusting to the League of Nations.

A Seat on the Council.
Australia has acquired a seat on the
Council of the League of Nations. Bruce
is to occupy it, though “S. M. Herald,”
which remained deaf and blind to the
campaign for keeping him abroad until
it had been consummated, has a fatuous
notion that it can persuade him to come
back. After returning thanks for Aus-
tralia’s election, Bruce spoke his mind
about the refusal of the huge staff at
Geneva to take 10 p.c. off their salaries.
These worthies are always ready to save
the world by talking and writing, but
they won’t share in its sufferings.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Sixenate”: Eight Hour Day (which is
Six Hour Day now) produced a lost in-
fant who caused a deal of worry to the
police at one Sydney station ; for the little
girl had a great capacity for tears, and
Dad didn’t call to inquire about her
“No, I don’t want to get married for a
long time”
“Who said anything about getting mar-
ried for a long time?”
until he felt inclined to go home. Dur-
ing the long wait a kindly John Hop got
the idea that a description of her pro-
genitor would help. “What’s your father
like?” he asked. “Beer,” returned the
infant promptly.
* * * *
“Oxmead”: The proposal for the direct
representation of aborigines at Canberra
reminds me that there have been natives,
however infrequent, who were capable
of absorbing the white man’s culture,
The Rev. Gordon Savile, an intensely
English product, who labored in the
Anglican vineyard at Kalgoorlie over 30
years ago, used to tell a good story of
qne abo. protege of his. A distinguished
visitor from England was talking over
old Oxford days with the parson when
a native knocked at the door of the
primitive vicarage and was cheerily
bidden to enter the only living room.
The globe-trotter eyed the dusky arrival,
who was conventionally dressed, with
considerable interest, and put a question
which he evidently regarded as suitable
to the native comprehension. “Which
way walkcm you?” he demanded geni-
ally. The abo., who, 1 believe, later de-
veloped into some sort of a missionary,
replied in excellent English, “J came to
ask Mr. Savile if I might use his tele-
phone”!

“Lord Luvus”: One result of the craze
for South Sea tours in overseas ships is
the new fashion in Melbourne of wear-
ing garlands of flowers round the neck.
At dances and parties it has become the
thing for persons of both sexes to so
decorate themselves, and the custom has
entered the best society, so it ought to
spread. At the Vic. Treepfanters’ Asso-
ciation luncheon Lud Mayor Gengoult
Smith had to eat his salad with a gar-
land of gumleaves, seeds and foliage tick-
ling his ears. An Indian refinement is
for the decorator of distinguished per-
sons to pull a scent spray out of his
pocket and squirt the necklet with cheap
perfume.
* * * *
“Sandig”: The idea that cemeteries
are menaces to health has nothing
to support it. Actually, gravedigging
is one of the healthiest of occu-
pations. The record of men so em-
ployed at Rookwood Cemetery (Sydney)
is remarkable evidence of this. During
the influenza epidemic of 1919 not one
of them contracted the disease —so
many victims of which they were help-
ing to inter. Further, not one has suf-
fered from any infectious fever for many
years past. Though their work is often
in damp places, the incidence of chest
complaints and colds is far lower than in
most manual occupations, and, though
they are in constant contact with rotted
coffins and rusted mountings, septic
hands are almost unknown. Possibly a
philosophical turn of mind, a good wage
and an assured job may help, but it is
worth noting that insurance companies
have reduced the gravediggers’ premium
for workers’ compensation from over £5
to 355.

“Bert the Carpenter”: The owner of
the local garage showed me a tin of
petrol-soaked sugar and remarked glumly
that it was one way of bringing a hus-
band to book. “Mrs. McNagger came
here the other night to say her old
man was out somewhere with the car,
stuck up, but she didn’t know where —
she had heard in a roundabout way over
the party telephone line. Just then the
’phone rang. McNagger speaking. His
car had broke down out at the pinery,
and would I come out and fix it? I
got out the break-down truck, and like
a fool allowed Mac’s missus to come
with me. She was pretty short with him
when we reached the car, and as soon
as I began to tinker with the works I
heard two women having a bust-up in
the pines. Mrs. McNagger was one.
“Mrs. Judson was telling me how much she enjoyed my sermon on Sunday.
She thought it was very well timed."
“It was well timed, all right. I saw lots of people looking at their watches."
‘Yes, I did it,’ she told me. ‘l’ve
suspected the brute of carrying on
with that McFlirter cat for a long time,
and to-night I put a handful of sugar in
the petrol-tank so’s it would stop when
it had run a few miles. And now I’ve
caught them, like I thought I would.’ ”
The garage man paused to shake the
sugar out of the tin. “And the worst
of it,” he added, “is that Mac blames me
for everything, and swears that he’s
going to deal with the opposition garage'
in future. And he used to buy 30 bobs’
worth of petrol every week.”
“Cine Ma”: London producers of
“Diggers,” the Australian-made comedy,
are up against the fact that the average
Cockney only knows the term as apply-
ing to feminine charmers who excavate
millionaires for gold. This is regarded
as such a serious obstacle that the owners
recently received a cable suggesting that
the title be changed to “Soldiers Don’t
Care.”

“Chevroford”: These automatic traffic
signals have their problems. The other
evening, drawn up at a Swanston-street
(Melb.) intersection, I-’-was waiting for
the lights to change. Presently, my retina
having recorded the customary change
from red to amber and then to green, I
moved off. A few seconds later I was
at the kerb, with an infuriated copper
demanding what the blazes I meant by
attempting to cross against the red. I
looked at the signal-box and was aston-
ished to see that it was indeed true. Then
my eye lit on an illuminated advertise-
ment, prominently displayed on the
side of a building a quarter of a mile
down the street. As I gazed it rapidly
changed from red to amber and green.
The cop accepted my explanation, but
told me to be more careful next time.

“Lao-dah”: Passers-by saw what
looked like the beginnings of a bank
smash in uppe? Collins-street the other
morning. Outside the branch of one of
Melbourne’s leading financial institutions
stood a crowd of citizens. The doors
were closed. The crowd was swelled by
anxious questioners, and rumors began to
fly about. Eleven o’clock chimed and
still the portals remained grimly shut.
Then a flustered official arrived with a
locksmith. It transpired that a member
of the staff, on trying to gain entrance,
had broken a Yale key in the lock.
Thankfully wiping their brows, citizens
went on their way.
“S.T.S.”: Touching those pictures
hidden away (B. 6/9/’33) in the crypt
of Sydney Art Gallery, probably all gal-
leries have the same surplusage, but
Adelaide has surmounted it pleasantly,
It got an Act passed allowing it to lend
any stuff not in use. Country institutes
were mainly intended to benefit; but
Parliament itself secured a whole batch
to decorate its walls. Since then insti-
tutes and a school or two—under strict
supervision, of course—have had a loan,
and even, on a special occasion, Gov-
ernment House.
“1894”: Broken Hill might be re-
garded as the most unlikely place in Aus-
tralia for an agricultural show, yet one
has been held there every year since
the town came into being, and it is at-
tended by thousands. Curiously enough,
the sheepmen do not assist it. Emery, the
mines head, took them to task at the
last show, saying that residents read of
A A wool bringing so much, but they
did not know what AA wool was, and
the pastoralists did not help them to
know. Exhibits are poultry of high stand-
ard, dogs of many breeds and long pedi-
grees, pigeons equal to any in Australia,
an indifferent lot of horses and various
fill-ups, including school- and needle-
work. But a show is held, and that is
the main thing.

“Oxmead”: An aggrieved N.S.W.
Assemblyman appealed to the Speaker
for protection against a writer who had
held him up to ridicule as a boresome
person with a particularly distressing
voice—at least that was the pith of the
charge, though it was set forth at much
greater length, and with an amazing
wealth of adjectives and similes. The
aggrieved one wanted his detractor
barred from the gallery, but the Speaker
ruled that, however unpalatable the persi-
flage, it contained no reflection on the
hon. member’s character and therefore
no notice could be taken of it. So the
complainant got no satisfaction beyond
being able to stigmatise the newspaper
man as “a foxy-faced fellow with the
anatomy of a starved pilchard,” a phrase
that will presumably be embedded in
“Hansard,” so that perhaps honors are
about easy. Danny Levy, of course, was
on perfectly safe ground in his ruling. If
members of Parliament were allowed to
take exception to unkindly comments on
their physical peculiarities, real or
alleged, what on earth would become of
the cartoonists and caricaturists? The
most stinging comment that ever
appeared in type is mild enough beside
the artist’s power to ridicule when he
chooses to exercise it —as, truth to tell, he
not infrequently does. And the picture
carries further, too ; there is a story of a
well-known Tammany politician who
“didn’t mind what fellows wrote of him,
because lots of his constituents couldn’t
read, and more of them didn’t,” but
admitted that “them pictures” touched
him on the raw. In Australia, at all
events, there is no record of any Parlia-
mentarian having ever sought the
Speaker’s protection against a cartoonist.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“jMr. Bruce lies represented a driving force in
Australian politics unequalled in this generation.
His proper place is here and he cannot too soon
return to it.”— ‘‘S. M. Herald.”
Come back, Mr. Bruce. You’ve succeeded
With that little conversion' affair
In London. Come back where you’re needed
A deal more intensely than there.
Each day it’s more freely admitted
That we haven’t discovered the man
To set in the place that you quitted.
Return to us, Stan!
Glib Scullin, your innings who ended,
Proved nothing but glitter and sound;
Like a rocket lie skyward ascended
And crashed like a stick to the ground.
And Lyons has no way to hold to
His job, and be lauded and loved,
Excepting he does what he’s told to
And goes where he's shoved.
Come back and there’s nought we’ll refuse you,
Come back, whatsoever the cost.
Reflect ’twas essential to lose you
To learn what a lot we had lost.
From Canberra’s premises placid
ro where Mars (aye, or Venus) holds sway,
1 here’s the test that’s unfailingly acid,
That’s always the way.
Though chaps in the dumps and the dolors
Found fault with your exquisite hats,
Or pointed a gibe at your collars
Or fashioned a jest at your spats,
You took your own line and you kept it,
Unlike those political goats
Who’ll tackle no project—except it
Means winning them votes.
You took your own line and persisted;
You held it, fair weather or squall;
You were never a weakling that twisted
Or faltered for fear of a fall.
When you won it was fairly and squarely,
You had triumphs assured and complete;
And you met it, no less debonairly
And gamely, defeat.
Come back, Mr. Bruce, to the furrow
You’re fittest to plough, it’s agreed.
We’ve a fancy for those who arethorough,
A liking for leaders who lead.
We sicken of scheming and striving,
Of pygmies who plot and who plan;
We sigh for some force that is driving.
Return to us, Stan!

T. THE R.


“Dairich”: There were some plausible
replies to official demands for failure-to-
vote reasons in connection with the N. S.
Wales Leg. Council referendum. One
of the frankest was from a Digger. It
read: “Early on election morning I met
a man who shared a shell with me in
France. We got drunk and were locked
up till Monday morning.” Some weeks
later the Digger told the J.P. who had
witnessed the effusion that he thought
“they must have been to the war, too,” as
he “hadn’t been stiffed yet.” A woman
defaulter wrote, a trifle ambiguously: “1
was just going to have a daughter, hoping
to be forgiven, as it is the first time.”
To date she hasn’t been “stiffed” either.

“X.S.”: No less a place than Melbourne
University now has its ballot-box scan-
dal. When the votes for the Faculty elec-
tions at the engineering school were
counted, it was found, to the academic
horror, that 207 votes had been cast for
a roll of only 170. Anguished inspection
revealed that 37 papers had been marked
in the same handwriting and signed with
fictitious names.

“Verri”: I rank my neighbor Binks
as the most ingenious minder of the
family infant I have yet encountered.
Mrs. Binks went off to tennis the other
afternoon, leaving Miss Binks, aged 18
months, in the paternal care. I heard
her final instructions anent amusing the
child, and not letting her cry, and giving
her a drink of orange juice at 4 p.m.,
“Now don’t let me see you do that again.”
“I’ll try not to, mummy; but I do wish you’d help, too.”
and when I went in to borrow the spade
I found Binks thoroughly enjoying his
afternoon. The house has a long hall,
in which Binks had placed chairs, boxes,
small tables and other obstructions be-
fore seating himself on the verandah with
his library book. Miss Binks was placed
at the far end of the hall, and when I
looked in a scarlet-faced and panting
infant was determinedly negotiating the
obstacles. After an hour’s hard work
she reached the verandah, where Binks
applauded her achievement and presented
her with a chocolate (not mentioned in
her diet chart). Then he carried her back
to her starting-point and resumed his
book. It took her another hour to earn
the second chocolate, while Binks read
six chapters undisturbed except by an
occasional yell at thwarted effort. Binks
had finished his book, cleared the hall
and was ready to accept Mrs. Binks’s
congratulations at 6 p.m.

“T.E.L.”: Touching on tests for in-
sobriety, I knew a Queensland police ser-
geant who had methods of his own in
dealing with suspected revellers. “A man
with ‘one over the eight,’ ” he told me,
“generally gives himself away by his
mouth. He either compresses it unnatur-
ally, or lets it sag completely. The eyes
are another good barometer. When a
man is boozed his eyes move very
slowly.” My sergeant set less store on
tongue-twisting sentences; “a knapsack
strap” was his longest one, and if a man
could repeat that clearly he would give
him the benefit of any doubt that might
exist. “Ladies,” he added reflectively,
“are much easier. In my experience I’ve
always found that women are either
stone-cold sober or absolutely sozzled —
there’s no betwixt and between with
them.”

“Ex-Cavalryman”: “Light Horse” (B.
27/9/’33) should have another look at
his drill Bible. The command “Right
turn” is not a preliminary to dismissal.
But on the command “Dismiss” dis-
mounted troops turn smartly to the right
and break off quietly—saluting smartly
with the right hand if an officer be in
charge of the parade. The same applies
to infantry.
* * * *
“C.Q.”: I note that some people in
Sydney are embittered at Melbourne’s
possession of the Captain Cook cottage,
which, they think, could be more fittingly
erected at Kurnell. A lot of people in
Melbourne are of the opinion that it
could be more fittingly erected almost
anywhere than in the selected spot —in
front of the facade of the National Gal-
lery in Swanston-street. Moreover, if
Sydney bought the thing from Mel-
bourne, there is prospect of a hearty
laugh coming for the sellers when the
facts of its dubious authenticity are fully
known. The great navigator wasn’t born
in it, nor did he die in it; in fact, there
is a strong suspicion that he never saw
it at all. The evidence that he ever lived
in it is founded on the unsworn oath of
that notorious liar tradition. Walter
Besant, the historian of Cook, says it
was possibly built by Cook’s father in
1755, though there is not even definite
evidence of that. In any case, Cook was
27 years old in 1755, and had long flown
from the paternal nest.

“Jungor”: Few would credit that the
mild and amiable King had ever been
subjected to anything in the nature of
Australian barracking, yet in the Perth
Public Library I once happened on a
book by a parson which took some pains
to establish that such a thing did once
occur. The scene was placed at Albany
in 1881, or thereabouts, when George and
his elder brother were visiting this con-
tinent on the Bacchante. The royal pair
had been participating in a kangaroo-
shoot and, returning to their ship, got
separated from the rest of the party.
According to the reverend narrator they
were unfortunate enough to fall in with
“What would you like me to give my typist for her birthday?”
“A reference.”
some particularly ill-conditioned larrikins
who, having a general objection to naval
uniforms and not the slightest idea of
the identity of the two lads v/ho were
asking their way to the jetty, assailed
them vigorously in the light and un-
friendly repartee of the period. The de-
monstration was so unpleasant that the
visitors very sensibly took to their heels
and, rounding a corner, were consider-
ably relieved to find themselves in sight
of their destination. It is the sort of item
that would be rigidly censored nowadays,
but there wasn’t much censorship of
books in Westralia 50 years ago.
* * * *
“Swanbourne”: An Australian place-
name that is pronounced wrongly is Cot-
tesloe, the seaside suburb between Perth
and Fremantle. From Parliamentarians to
radio announcers, they all make it Cott-
es-loe, three syllables, and the local poet
naturally does the same. All are quite
wrong. The place, like other adjacent
ones, was named after the Fremantle
family, which became noble when the
third baronet was raised to the peerage
with the title of Baron Cottesloe in 1874.
And, according to the English books of
reference which specialise in such
matters, the word is pronounced “Cotslo.”
“Chevroford”: The Girls’ High School
in Spring-street, Melbourne, has gone
under the wrecker’s hand. It was a fine
old semi-classic building with enormous
basements which caused a local legend
that it was originally a gaol, though it
was actually built 60 years ago as a
model school. Of recent years the girls
had to do their lessons holding um-
brellas over their heads to keep off the
rain dripping through the decrepit roof.
When the work of demolition is com-
pleted the College of Surgeons will erect
its shack.

“X.S.”: About the most impudent
ruse to date was that of a thug in Mel-
bourne who ’phoned a grocer and told
him to send his boy with groceries to a
vacant house into which the speaker said
he and his family had just moved. When
the boy arrived at the back door a voice
told him to enter and put the order on
the kitchen table. A fortunate glimpse
inside of a masked man standing waiting
to receive him with a hammer handle
made the youth bolt for his life.

“C.Q.”: Heidelberg is the latest suburb
of Melbourne that yearns to be called a
city. It is a vast, scattered diocese with
huge areas where not a house is
to be seen, though thoroughfares have
been laid out with names like Lily-street
and Claude-crescent. In the post-war
land boom farmer after farmer was
bought out, and enough allotments were
sold to provide for a population of
a million or more. The owners still
pay the rates and occasionally get
served with orders to get rid of plant
pests. Now that the fences are down
they run foxes, rabbits and hares. The
finances of Heidelberg are no better than
those of other suburbs round about. Just
before the depression arrived streets and
sewers were being run wherever there
was a dwelling or two. Then everything
suddenly collapsed. Now the shire hopes
to restore its shattered fortunes by giving
a park to the Government, which said
Government is expected to turn into a
vast athletic stadium at a cost of £20,000
or so.

“X.S.”: Two murders in Melbourne,
the callous shooting of a man in Fitzroy
and the battering to death of a poultry-
farmer at Preston, have started re-
newed talk about the crime wave and
complaints about the police. The Fitz-
roy killing is said to be an episode in
a gang feud. The Preston incident seems
to have been one of those affairs where
assassination was not intended. To blame
t h e police for these happenings is to
ma lign a hard-working body of men, a
] ar g e and growing proportion of whose
time is spent in jobs that have nothing
t 0 do with the suppression of cr j me .
Eighty consta bles had to be about

their miserabl ' be longings to somewhere
where they will create another problem

THE NEW PENOLOGY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Tlie increase in crimes of violence is attributed
bv Sydney poiice partly to the leniency of magis-
trates and partly to the improved conditions in
prisons, which include concerts, boxing exhibitions
and other entertainments.”
The world grows wickeder, say police,
And parsons sometimes echo the view;
The saints, unhappily, don’t increase
One half as fast as the sinners do.
A thing that’s saddening, if it’s true,
Vet the cloud has a silver streak, methinks:
With all the worries there are to rue
At least we’ve better and brighter clinks.
The wind is tempered, they never cease
To tell, to the lamb (and the ram and ewe
As well, it follows) that’s stripped of fleece;
And it’s tempered now to the shearer, too.
In the bad old days there were pleasures few
For the luckless lag, and a lack of links
With the rollicking life that once he knew.
But now we’ve better and brighter clinks.
Time was he had to await release,
And see the stretch he was serving through,
To sample a Hollywood masterpiece.
When the grim gates clanged ’twas a long
adieu
To the good old ring where the bruisers
threw
1 heir vicious jabs for the purse that chinks.
No wonder gaol had a sombre hue,
But now we’ve better and brighter clinks.
Shadows we may be, and shades pursue,
But the world goes forward, for all its kinks.
What matter reforms that are overdue?
At least we’ve better and brighter clinks.

POLITICAL POINTS
Australia is importing another Anglican
bishop—from Liverpool this time. Known
there as Canon How, he is to become
Archbishop of Brisbane. Bishops come in
duty-free. Ambitious Australian-born
clergymen are of opinion that they should
be taxed 100 p.c. on the value of their
worldly possessions or that the Contract
Laborers Act should apply.
The A.M.P. promised that it would
lower its interest rates if income tax
were reduced, and the promise has been
kept. On real-estate mortgages it now
charges 4\ p.c., and municipalities are to
pay 4| p.c. Lang would have looted
this splendid Australian institution by
means of his mortgage tax, but he was
stopped in time.
Bananaland’s Government railways
have staggered confiding persons by de-
claring a profit of £57,654 for the 1932-
33 financial year. The truth is that the
“profit” and the smallness of the last
deficit (£27,000) are attributable to the
pleasant fiction that interest is no longer
payable on the £28,000,000 of railway
capital written off by the Moore Govern-
ment. . The interest still has to be paid,
but the theory is that it will cheer people
up to pretend that it hasn’t to be.
Lang had unhappy moments during
the N.S.W. Assembly debate on the bill
to reduce his bob-in-the-pound wages
tax. He spent two hours shedding croco-
dile tears about possible effects on the
worker, and protested that wage-earners
with less than £4 a week should not pay
tax. If he had had his way in 1931
workers with £2 a week would have had
to ante up 2s. 6d. in the £ to his Govern-
ment.
Lang became so flustered when speak-
ing on the relief-tax cuts that he ad-
mitted having been “wrong” in raising
Bavin’s tax from 3d. in the £ to a shilling.
So while mugs were shouting “Lang is
Right,” Lang, by his own confession,
was Wrong.
Forgan Smith has gladdened the hearts
of his devoted allies of the Queensland
civil service by providing for the auto-
matic salary increases that used to fall
like the gentle dew from Heaven until
they were suspended by Moore. There
was a rumor that all the money that
might have become due during the sus-
pension period of three years or so would
be paid out in cash ; but even Foggy
propped at that hurdle.
Collier is arranging for a deficit of
£748,400. He has had to admit that he
is getting £1,073,400 from the Common-
wealth Oppressor this year—only
£308,600 less than the anticipated yield
from all the State taxes, although his
State harbors the one Australian indus-
try that is prospering mightily and ex-
panding every month. Presumably he
would like to get a lot more revenue
from Kalgoorlie-Boulder, Wiluna and
the rest, but he is afraid to suggest it.
If he did, the goldfields might start an-
other separation movement.
Vic. Government has sustained another
windfall, a business man who prefers to
remain anonymous having offered £7OOO
for a park on the new Yarra Boulevard
to supplement the bridge donated by
Macpherson Robertson. When the his-
tory of Depresh in Melbourne comes to
be written the astonishing fact will be
revealed that more money was spent on
fur coats and pearl necklaces for the most
congested spot in Victoria than ever
before in its existence. Wherever one
goes men are digging op weeds, planting
ornamental shrubs and fiddling about
with beautification schemes.
Measures against Communists are pro-
mised again by the Stevens Government.
If it is really in earnest it should begin
by depriving them of privileges which,
in one way and another, cost the public
a good deal of money. It is grotesque
that ruffians who openly aim at over-
throwing our institutions and seizing pro-
perty by force should be allowed to stand
for the “capitalistic” Parliament and get
their names on ballot-papers gratis, and
that the Crown should find their costs
when they start a riot, hoping that it will
flame into a revolution.
Westralia’s secessionists are beginning
to quarrel among themselves. They all
wanted to be on the committee which is
“to prepare the case for submission to
the Imperial Parliament,” and, without
consulting their league, the Labor Gov-
ernment has nominated two defeated
politicians (one the somewhat exploded
Scaddan), two civil servants and two
other gentlemen, doubtless estimable but
obscure. One member of the committee
is wrathfully pronounced an anti, and
not one is a goldfielder. Apparently the
Government is willing to wound seces-
sion, though afraid to strike.
The coalition between the followers of
Smuts and Hertzog is already showing
ONLY HALF DONE.
“No good cutting it down like that, Joe. Cut it down to the roots so that we may
get a plough into the ground.”
signs of cracking up. At the congress of
the Dutch National party, Hertzog, as
leader, tried to bring about a permanent
fusion with the Smuts party. He met
with strong opposition, and the proposal
was turned down by 142 votes to 30. Dr.
Malan, who stood out when the coalition
came about, led the opposition, voic-
ing neutrality in a British war and the
right to issue republican propaganda as
features of his programme. Another
general election will probably be Hert-
zog’s next move.
Having become hardened to rebuffs,
Victoria’s Argyle Ministry took calmly
its defeat in committee on the Transport
Regulation Bill. Appointment for five
years of the board of five which has been
surveying the field of transport was pro-
posed. “No ; have a board of 15,” said
Blackburn, one of the Opposition’s legal
lights, and his amendment was carried.
Ten Cockies combined with nine Labor-
ites, five Yaps who would like to see the
bill shelved and Jimmy McLachlan to
make the majority. For a few hours it
looked as if the undertaker would be
called in, but next day the Government
decided to appoint a sub-committee to
try to reconcile conflicting views. Mean-
while the three Agrarians in the Cabinet
hold on to their portfolios and look
towards recess.
With Bruce's withdrawal from Com-
monwealth politics at the instance of
Lyons—that gentleman coolly admits now
that he suggested it —the Flinders seat
must be filled. The Country party does
not intend to contest it, but it is natur-
ally taking a keen interest in the matter.
Now that Lyons seems intent on reject-
ing the chance of a coalition, thinkers
in both sections are casting round for
some leader who would bring the parties
together. Massy Greene, who has re-
tired from the Ministry, would suit the
Cockies, despite that unfortunate experi-
ence in Richmond ; but Flinders might
not care for a Sydney man. Another
possibility is Lawson, a Victorian, an ex-
Premier and a Senator, well liked by the
Cockies. Nominated for Flinders, he
would get C.P. support, and if he or
Greene were afterwards to step into the
leadership, unity would be assured.
It will be a queer thing if Russia
acquires a new bourgeoisie by way of
art. Actors under the Soviet are accorded
the same honor as cinema stars in
America, and they are just as tempera-
mental. Kozlovsky, a leading histrion, was
ordered to perform at Nijni-Novgorod,
where is the largest Soviet motor factory.
As the price for his appearance, he de-
manded a car, flivvers being the' highest
ambition of the liberated proletariat. His
request was refused, and he staged a one-
man strike. “There are caprices of an
artistic soul which become anti-social
acts of a most unpardonable nature,”
declared one newspaper solemnly.
“Fight” is one of the overworked
words. Politicians are said to “fight”
when they spout to “Hansard” reporters,
Younger Sets, matrons and quavering old
gentlemen in pursuit of votes. Sometimes
the persons who indulge in these pro-
ceedings and others involving no personal
risk, such as writing to the papers, refer
to themselves as “fearless fighters.” The
elderly Holloway, put up in 1929 to keep
Bruce busy in Flinders, unexpectedly
defeated him. When the 1931 election
came round Holloway had retreated to
the Labor pocket borough of Melbourne
Ports. It was suggested the other day
that he should take his chance in Flinders
again at the by-election. He scurried
to cover like a startled rabbit, but before
disappearing, was heard to say that he
would “ ‘fight’ for the restoration of the
old-age pension to a pound a week”
instead.
Newcastle Trades Hall has had a
stormier history than most buildings in
Australia, and does not get quieter with
age. The other day the chairman of its
council remarked, after a few people had
been threatened with expulsion, “Get me
a set of gloves and an aeroplane and a
radio, so that I can deal with you all at
the one time, and I might be able to
manage.” The edifice is to have its
jubilee on November 25. A Donny-
brook would be a fitting celebration.
Queensland Labor, which reintroduced
the 44-hour week as part of its economy
campaign, has been thinking up other
ways of confounding Depresh. Employees
in Government railway refreshment-
rooms are to have the privileges accorded
to other railway workers —free passes
and other luxuries. The cost won’t be
light, but then taxpayers are in the
minority.
Cabinet approval has been given to
the proposal to enlarge Melbourne
Cricket Ground by taking in a crescent-
shaped strip from Yarra Park. Accom-
modation for another 30,000 spectators
(bringing the holding capacity up to
100,000) will thus be provided. Legisla-
tion is necessary ; it is pretty sure to be
passed.
A suggestion that Vic. Cabinet meet-
ings are marked by occasional piquancy
was conveyed to the Assembly by
Menzies the day after the reverse on his
Transport Bill. Explaining a clause in
the Police Offences Bill, Menzies said
the present law made it necessary to
prove that one accused of running a
gambling den had “dominion or con-
trol over the house.” Premier Argyle,
with a grin, inquired if a man would be
liable if he laid a bet in “this House.”
Menzies retorted: “There appears to be
some doubt whether you’ve any dominion
or control over this House.” The
members relished the spectacle of the
A.-G. cheeking the boss.
It is not only in the ocean depths that
dangers to shipping remain uncharted.
The other day the Manunda was unable
to berth at Melbourne’s North Wharf.
Shipping people took soundings and
found a bottom at 20 feet. The Harbor
Trust plan showed 274 feet.
Queensland’s workmen's homes scheme
has not worked out so badly. It was
initiated in 1910 by Kidston; since then
£6,974,027 has been advanced on long-
term contracts, enabling 15,524 houses to
be built. Half these are fully-paid-for.
Scullin has opened the Federal session
in a mood of vigor which suggests that
competition for the Labor leadership is
to be keen. He said that the Lyons
Budget was “a reckless surrender of
sound finance to political expediency,”
and he attacked the wheat agreement as
“this foul policy of restriction —a damna-
tion policy for the world, and producing
countries in particular.” N.S.W. Labor,
with which Scullin’s “party” is seeking to
coalesce, is hailing Roosevelt, the father
of restriction, as the economic Messiah

Colin Stephen, for 15 years chairman
of the A.J.C., possesses a fine record as
an amateur jockey. He rode his first
winner at Randwick when 19 years old,
and after 10 years in the saddle retired
with a record of 58 wins from 162
mounts. His success as an owner and
breeder, however, has not been so
marked, few important events having
gone his way. He has been an A.J.C.
committeeman for 23 years, an office
held by his father, S. A. Stephen, for a
number of years in the ’eighties. Before
that his uncle, W. R. Campbell, was
also on the committee for a long time.
Steve Bayliss, of Tamworth (N.S.W.),
whose leg was taken off above the knee
several years ago, is, perhaps, the only
one-legged shearer in Australia. He
manages 160 a day, but finds the job
hard on artificial limbs, the light hollow
wood of which shatters at the knee-joint
under the strain. He always carries a
couple of spares and uses them up every
season.
Paddy (P.J.) Minahan is no more. He
made a fortune out of bootmaking and
successful land deals, but held his N.S.W.
Labor affiliations as a delegate of the
Musicians’ Union. In the days when he
and his brother had a shop in Hunter-
street, Sydney, Paddy helped things out
by tootling in an orchestra at night and
during matinees; that was long before
big factories were within their dreams. As
a politician Minahan was not in the same,
class as he was as a bootmaker. He fell
out with Lang in 1927 ; and that was the
end of his N.S.W. Assembly career. He
was a generous giver, particularly to R.C.
charities.
Alexander Peacock, who died during
the week-end, had been an M.L.A. since
1889 and a knight since 1901. First a
teacher, he became a secretary with an
expert knowledge of mining law, but his
love of politics transcended everything
else in his life. He first sat in a Ministry
in 1892, and had been in nine be-
fore becoming Speaker of the Assembly.
Three times he had been Premier and
Treasurer, and he was a member of the
The late ALEXANDER PEACOCK,

last Federal Convention, and had served
as Masonic Grand Master of his State.
Peacock enjoyed life to the full, and got
on well with members of all parties. He
was 72 when he died.
Adarti Smith, who was at “Scotch,”
Melbourne, 70 years ago, and in Gipps-
land afterwards, is dead at Naracoorte,
just across the S.A. border, where the
family established a merino stud. He
occupied nearly every possible public
position locally, municipal, agricultural,
racing and Caledonian.
Laborite Ted Cotter has just completed
a quarter of a century’s service as mem-
ber for Richmond in Vic. Assembly. He
has ability above the average, but has
never been given any of the plums. The
honorary job of deputy-chairman of
committees is the only one he has held.
ERNEST CLARK, Tasmania’s new
Governor.
Joe Riley, who retires from the secre-
taryship of the N. Z. Insurance Co. in
Adelaide, is the man who succeeded John
Creswell as secretary of the S.A. Cricket
Association and the Agricultural Society.
Each is now a full-time job for someone
else, but John and Joe attended to both,
and a lot of duties besides.
The Mollison scholarship in Japanese
at Melbourne University seems to be a
stepping-stone to Tokio. One of its
holders, P. V. Russo, has been appointed
lecturer in comparative philology at Bun-
rika University. Another, H. B. Jamieson,
is taking a course in languages at the
same institution, at which he proposes
also to graduate as a naval officer, his
professional qualification for matricula-
tion being his membership of the Royal
Australian Naval Reserve. Apparently
we need not feel the closing down of
Jervis Bay Naval School after all.
Back in Australia on a visit to New-
castle and Broken Hill is John Moul-
den, long resident in the other New-
castle, or in London, as general man-
ager of the Sulphide Corporation. He
is a brother of the late Frank Moulden,
several times Mayor of Adelaide, and of
Eldin, who died young when already
second only to Goodman in the S.A.
Tramways Trust.
William Still Littlejohn, who died the
other day, was made for the job of head-
master of Vic. Scotch College, for he was
an Aberdonian with a Maoriland training
and enough heather in his accent in
earlier years to stock a moor. He came
south to be assistant master at Nelson
College, M.L., where one of his pupils
was Lord Rutherford, the physicist, and
there distinguished himself by his ser-
vices to the volunteer movement. He
was principal of the college from 1899
to 1904, when he came to Melbourne to
manage the affairs of “Scotch.” He was
a big figure in Victorian education, and
latterly had been a member of the coun-
cil and Faculty of Education of the Uni-
versity.
Every schoolboy of 1899 longed to be
Bugler Dunn, who in the best Kipling
manner was born in the barracks in
Dublin and went to the Boer War, to be
shot through the shoulder and to win
the V.C. at 14 years old and be given
a silver bugle by Queen Victoria. His
was a brief hour of glory. Life was a
struggle until the Great War, when he
had four pleasing years at the front. He
came to Australia in 1920, set up as a
sideshow-man and “escapologist”—he de-
clared that he had been a pupil of
Houdini —but for three years he had
been unable to work through illness. He
passed like too many V.Cs. —in pain and
poverty, at 48 years.
Climbing a mountain to attend the
funeral of a Maori chief proved too
much for the heart of Henry Edmund
Holland, leader of the M.L. Labor party
in Parliament. He was lame, and his
health had been poor for many years.
He was born near Canberra 65 years
ago, served his apprenticeship as a comp,
on the Queanbeyan “Times,” and for
a while helped to set up The Bulletin.
An ardent trade-unionist, he came into
prominence in 1901 as leader of a strike
of tailoresses. He served gaol terms in
1896 and 1909 for his activities as an
industrial agitator, and in 1912 migrated
to M.L., where he became editor of the
“Worker.” Holland went to prison in
Wellington in 1914 for sedition (oppos-
ing conscription), and entered Parlia-
ment in 1918 as representative of a West-
land constituency, which retained his ser-
vices to the time of his death. Though
his mind was embittered by his conflicts
with authority, he set his party in Parlia-
ment a fine example of courtesy and
decorum, and, as Priminister Forbes has
testified, his word was his bond.
J. A. J. Hunter, who has been the
U.C.P. Whip in the Federal Parliament
since 1924, and who acted as one of the
Government Whips during the Bruce-
Page term, is a likeable chap whose
hobby seems to be collecting account-
ancy fellowships. In full dress, his name
carries after it the letters F.C.1.A.,
F.F.1.A., F.C.1.5., F.1.C.A., M.H.R. He

holds his western Queensland electorate

rule never to talk politics unless he is
compelled to do so. He is a certainty
for a Country-party Ministry if one ever
should be formed.
Mayne Linton came out of Bowness
in Cumberland to become an actor, and
made his first stage appearance with F.
R. Benson’s company in London. Four
years later he went to America with Ben
Greet’s Pastoral Players, appeared with
George Arliss in “Disraeli,” joined the
Sothern-Marlowe company and busked
blithely on till half-way through the war,
when he became attached to the Toronto
Mobilisation Centre and afterwards to
MAYNE LINTON, one of George
Arliss’s young men.
the British Military Mission to the U.S.A.
The Firm brought him to Australia in
1922 to play the leading role in “The Bat,”
and ever since he has been prominent on
the Australian stage. His theatrical
school is one of the best-known in the
Commonwealth.
Tom Clarke, who has resigned the
managing-editorship of the London
“News Chronicle,” is a deceptive-looking
person. He seems too small, modest and
unobtrusive to manage anything. As
news editor, however, he was for long
the driving force of the London “Daily
Mail” when its circulation was para-
mount among dailies. Actually, his only
failure was as assistant editor of the
Melbourne “Herald,” which he found
more Northcliffian in its atmosphere than
Carmelite House. Behind his unimpos-
ing exterior Clarke hid a tough will—
he was born and bred in Lancashire —
and a mort of experience earned on the
staff of the South China “Morning Post,"
at Hong Kong, as a correspondent of
the Chicago “Tribune” during the Russo-
Japanese war and on the Manchester and
London press. He is a good and under-
standing friend of Australia.
South Australia’s Josiah Symon, K.C.,
who celebrated his 87th birthday on Sept.
27, shows no sign of failing powers.
Recently he took part in an Empire-wide
broadcast. Later this year, as a sur-
vivor of the Federal Convention and
the first Federal Parliament, Symon,
it is hoped, will be the chief representa-
tive and spokesman of a party of first
Federal Parliamentarians who will be the
guests of a Melbourne body interested
in our Constitutional developments.
O. D. Jones, a veteran schoolmaster,
dead in S.A., came into the limelight
just once, 30-odd years ago. Governor
Le Hunte was visiting his school at
Gawler, and, to lead up to the National
Anthem, asked the kids who was a
greater man than himself. They replied
in chorus, “Mr. Jones.”
A. G. C. Pentreath, clergyman, 31.
married, and a first-class classics gradu-
ate of Cambridge, has been selected
headmaster for St. Peter’s School, Adel-
aide, by a London committee including
Cyril Norwood, of Harrow, and Vic.’s
ex-Governor, Lord Somers. Pentreath
has been a headmaster in Natal, and
more recently was “Master of- the King’s
scholars” at Westminster.

There were 29.000 more motor-cars on
the roads in Australia at June 30 than
there were a year earlier. The year’s
imports of chassis and parts amounted
to £1,577,359 as against £467,564 for the
preceding 12 months. Thus the demand
for tyres increased ; also, the co. has
met with a measure of success in the
manufacture of new lines (chiefly elastic
webbing, golf balls and Latex uphol-
stery). The output of the big plant was
still well below capacity ; but large sav-
ings had been made in the buying, manu-
facturing and marketing sections of the
business. So the management was able
to make further cuts in retail prices
and show £122,940 more gross earn-
ings (£859,004), making the spring
£149,618 over the last two years.
Including “liberal” allowance for de-
preciation, exes. (£617,085) took £88,362
of the increase, leaving enough to
pay the prefs. their 10 p.c. and show
3.9 p.c. on the £3,765,655 of ord. capital
as against 3, 2.1, 6 and 12.1 p.c. back to
1929, when the Perdriau business was
welded into the organisation and all but
a handful of the 550,000 ords. in the
Barnet Glass Co. were bought for 325.
apiece (Barnet Glass paid 4 p.c. last
month in respect of the year to June 30,
compared with 3,5, 6 and 10 p.c. for the
four preceding years).
The div. was lifted a point, making it
4 p.c., reserves being visibly tapped for
£1707 for the purpose. That reduced
the tangible support for capital to
£137,975—g00dwi1l (£354,377) is not
treated as an asset herein. The declared
aim, however, is to strengthen the prop
for capital as opportunity offers; a
policy which prudent shareholders will
not quarrel with, though it means keep-
ing the div. down for a while.
Finances are comfortable, and balance-
sheet movements are encouraging:

To strengthen the cash holding by
£33,610, clip £151,258 off the debt and
add £157,149 to the stocks item (a lot
of raw rubber was bought while prices
were at their lowest) investments were
drawn upon for £262,846, and the book
value of fixed assets was reduced by
£59,722, despite substantial additions and
improvements during the year. The
growth in the more or less liquid surplus
(£1,800,296, including stocks) was
£93,119.
The outlook is brighter than at any
time during the last four years. In
1932 the duty on raw rubber (4d. a
pound) plus primage (10 p.c.) took
£lOB,OOO (= 2.8 p.c. on ord. capital).
These levies have now been halved,
sales, income and other taxes have been
reduced and there is more money about.
The market prices the ords. at 19s. 2d.
as against 16s. a year ago. The return
at 19s. 2d. is 4.2 p.c. on a 4 p.c. div.
basis. At 335. 6d. the prefs. return 6 p.c.

The profit, though small, was an im-
provement of £25,468 on the previous
year’s result. It suggests that the old
high-priced stocks (they appear to have
been responsible for most of the trouble
in ’3l and ’32) have been cleared, or,
whatever remained of them, written
down to present-day values. Also, the
shop was kept open on Friday nights,
more attention was given to display, and
turnover improved. However, there is
£464,187 of capital to feed in 30,000 first
7 p.c. and 52,500 second 8 p.c. prefs. and
381,687 ords. The £7711 netted was
enough to pay a full year’s pref. divs.
(after allowing for the statutory cut) and
show 0.7 p.c. on ord. capital. But there
was three years’ money coming to the
prefs. when the books closed. The firsts’
slate was cleaned, and the seconds got
their div. in respect of 1931, reserves
being tapped for £1923 for the purpose,
leaving £18,453 of the capital unrepre-
sented by tangibles—goodwill (£67,660)
has not been treated as an asset herein.
The market prices the firsts at 235.
6d. and the seconds at 225. Allowing
for the statutory cut, the return at these
figures is 4.6 p.c. and 5.6 p.c. respec-
tively. The seconds rank after the firsts
for capital and divs., and there will be
£9932 (= 3s. 7d. per share) coming to
them at the end of July next, making
total pref. divs. due at that date £11,559.
The more speculative ords. at Bs. 9d.
would return 8 p.c. on a 3| p.c. distri-
bution. The book value of the net tan-
gible cover is £l4 17s. Id. firsts, £7 18s.
4d. seconds, and 19s. ords.

The year’s growth of £11,419 in debtors’
balances and reductions of £3887 in
stocks and £3359 in the amount coming
to creditors are encouraging movements.
The spring in the more or less liquid
surplus (£221,841) was £9355. Stocks
are at their lowest level for over a de-
cade ; the item accounted for 39 p.c.
of the tangible assets when the books
closed.

First prefs. reduced to 5 p.c. and seconds to 5.8 p.c.
under Interest Reduction Act from Oct. 1, 1931,
till July 31, 1932.
The improvement of £21,338 in last
year’s net result made the spring
£43,421 over the last two years. It reflects
the management’s energy, imagination
and foresight in dealing with the new
trading problems. The outstanding
feature of the year’s history was the
maintenance of a vigorous sales offen-
sive, with one eye upon family budgets
and the other upon capricious fashion.
Turnover improved, prices generally
were steadier and stocks less trouble-
some.
The £93,394 netted was enough to pay
the prefs. their full contract rates and
then show 10.9 p.c. on the £600,000 of
ord. capital, as against 8.7, 3.7, 7.6, 15.1,
11.8, 16 and 17.1 p.c. back to 1926. The
div., which had been steady at 10 p.c.
for the nine years to the close of accounts
in 1929, was lifted from 5 p.c. to 8 p.c.
Under the Interest Reduction Act, that
automatically restores the pref. divs. to
their old contract rates again.
Prospects of 8 p.c. to the ords. being
maintained during the current term look
bright enough. The price of wool
is up, unemployment is declining and the
Federal and State cuts in income, unem-
ployment-relief and sales taxes, together
with the reduction in primage and aboli-
tion of family endowment, should help
spending and lighten overhead.
Over the last two years the first prefs.
have advanced from 15s. to 245. 9d. in
the market, the seconds from 16s. 6d. to
265., and the ords. from 12s. to 355. 6d.,
which is the highest point they have ever
reached. At the higher figures the return
is 4.8 p.c. firsts, 5.7 p.c. seconds and 4.5
p.c. ords. At 355. 6d. the investor who
looks for 5£ p.c. on his money counts on
the ord. div. going to 10 p.c. The net
tangible cover is £ll 4s. firsts, £4 19s.

During the year the co. bought the free-
hold of part of its old George-street
premises, where it continues to trade in
men’s wear, etc., for £42,000. The net
increase in the book value of fixed assets
was only £3867. Also, £50,259 was knocked
off mortgages, etc., while £30,747 was
added to the stocks item and £18,184 to
debtors’ balances. To do all this invest-
ments and cash were drawn upon for
£52,561, the board went to its bankers for
£9092, and leant upon depositors for a
further £9047. Still, the more or less
liquid surplus (£185,344, including stocks)
was £30,511 stronger than at the pre-
vious balance.

In 1922 this co. and J. Boag and Son
transferred their beer-making plants, etc.,
to a subsidiary, Tasmanian Breweries
Pty., for £200,000 in scrip, one half 8 p.c.
cum. prefs. and the other half ords. Cas-
cade’s whack was 52,407 prefs. and
50,000 ords., together £63,000 in excess of
the book value of tangibles transferred.
The trouble began about six years ago,
when, in order to meet competition,
prices were cut and a new Nathan brew-
ing plant was installed, and the operating
co. ceased to contribute to the pool.
Cascade paid no divs. in ’2B and ’29, and
only 2} p.c. and 3| p.c. in the two fol-
lowing years. By this time the opposi-
tion concern was experiencing difficulties,
too, and the Pty.’s local and inter-State
trade began to revive, notwithstanding
the decline in beer consumption gener-
ally.
During the last term gross earnings
(£41,312) slipped £1295. But savings
amounting to £lB5B more than that were
made, leaving the net result at 7.3 p.c. on
capital as against 6.3 p.c. for the previous
year. That is disregarding £2OOO taken
from reserves to write down the book
value of the freehold. The div. was
lifted half a point, making it 5| p.c., the
final being at the rate of 6 p.c. p.a.
Owing to the better outlook, including
“arrangements made with some of the
mainland breweries,” the co.’s trade can
be expected to further improve. Out-
goings will benefit by the reduction of 3d.
a gallon in excise on beer, though this
cut is expected to be passed on to the
public, and by the drop from Is. 4.8 d. to
Is. in the £ in income tax and by the 50
p.c. cut in super tax on income from pro-
perty. Shareholders’ prospects are thus
much improved. The weight of the debt,
however, threatens to be a handicap:

It was mainly to finance installation of

and £50,000 of fresh capital was gathered.
When the books closed the debt exceeded
more or less liquids, including stocks
but not shares, by £95,382, or £6662 less
than at the previous balance. The float-
ing debt is well covered. Since the amal-
gamation £52,462 of the goodwill hold-
ing in the Pty. has been written off.

Profits earned in Australia during the
last term showed marked improvement,
the board says. But the gains here were
nearly all swallowed by losses in Maori-
land, where, it is hoped, public and
private expenditure on water-supply
schemes, etc., will presently revive. The
£7187 netted from all sources was no
more than 1.4 p.c. on the half-million
of capital compared with 1.3, 3.4, 10.9
and 11 p.c. back to 1929, the year before
slump pulled up large-scale public bor-
rowing and expenditure with a jerk.

down £2139).

Immediate prospects are that earnings
from the Australian section may im-
prove a trifle; the outlook in Maori-
land is less encouraging. Much is ex-
pected from a new manufacturing pro-
cess, which is being installed at all fac-
tories. The chief subsidiary, Hume Steel,
is finding it difficult to keep up pay-
ments to the prefs. It is difficult to say
when its ords. (the parent holds 165,000
of them at a cost of £416) are likely
to come into the picture. The Singapore
co., the most successful of the Hume
group, paid 6 p.c. in March ; it is ex-
tending its business to Hong Kong and
Shanghai.
At Us. 3d. the pound shares would
return 8.9 p.c. on a 5 p.c. distribution,
which would call for £25,000.
Raub, Ltd.
Raub, now in its 41st year and still
going strong, is one of the most success-
ful shows ever floated in Australia to
work a mine abroad. It is operating at
three points on a gold-bearing reef in
Pahang, Malaya. The reduction plant
consists of 50 stamps, two Huntington
mills, a cyaniding plant and suction-
cutter dredge. For the 12 months to the
end of February the dredge, which has
been kept in good condition, was idle.
The mill handled 38,190 tons of crudes
(2060 tons more than in the previous
year), and 4571 tons of con-
centrates were cyanided. The lot yielded
24,523 fine ounces of gold, which
brought in £145,668 ; sundry income was
£4904. Exes., including £10,754 for de-
preciation and £4148 royalty, took
£61,654, leaving £88,918 net, of which
£BO,OOO was distributed in four quarterly
divs. totalling 40 p.c., making the aver-
age 21\ p.c. over the last four years.
At the end of March creditors
figured for £27,241. More or less liquids
totted up to £83,900 ; the mine, plant,
etc., appeared at £193,401. The measure
ore reserves are conservatively figured
at 53,950 tons, of which 37,050 tons aver-
age over 10dwt., 11,900 tons between
sdwt. and 10dwt., and 5000 tons between
3dwt. and sdwt. In addition, over £35,000
of profit remains in the old tailings
dump, which consists largely of arseno-
pyrites, the successful treatment of which
is a feather in the cap of g.m. Lilburne —
the refractory concentrates are first
roasted in oil-fired furnaces. A lot more
payable stone is expected to show up in
the old Raub Hole workings, which are
being dewatered to 250 ft. Also, samp-
ling has disclosed 12dwt. to 15dwt. stuff
in the lower levels of the old Silensing
mine, 46 miles away, over which a lease
has been obtained. Everything points to
this being a valuable property when de-
veloped, says A. S. Lilburne. While gold
remains at over £6 an ounce in London,
the co. has many years of profitable life
ahead of it yet. Under existing condi-
tions, the co.’s tin area remains un-
worked.
For the 19 months to June 30 (they in-
cluded only nine months of actual pro-
duction), Aberfoyle Tin, Stoney’s Creek
(Tas.), netted £8649, paid an all-round
12i p.c. on its £62,500 of capital for the
last six months of the term, and put
£3634 in the cupboard. Gross earnings
were £25,862, of which mining and treat-
ment took £13,116, and other exes., in-
cluding £lOOO for depreciation, £4098.
Expenditure on development was £llB7,
making the total under this head £28,393.
When the books closed there was £1076
coming- to creditors; more or less
liquids, including concentrates on hand,
totalled £12,310. During the nine months
8161 tons of crudes were put through
the mill for 175.7 tons of first and 126.7
tons of second concentrates. The mag-
netic separators treated 191.4 tons of
firsts for 180.1 tons of tin oxide and 13.7
tons of wolfram; the discrepancy in the
figures is said to be due to “surplus in
actual dry weights over estimates of
material in process.” The oxide assayed
66.27 p.c. tin, and the wolfram 72.95
p.c. tungstic acid. The presence of arseni-
cal pyrite lowered the quality of the tin.
Installation of a rotary calciner, how-
ever, is expected to overcome the diffi-
culty. Though the seconds were put
through the roaster, the dressing plant
was not ready when the books closed.
At June 30 ore reserves above No. 1
level were put at 20,080 tons, and over
31,000 tons have been measured up below
the level. In addition parallel ore-bodies
have been met with at various points in
the workings.

North Arm goldfield (Q.) has not
lived up to recent expectations formed
of it as a producer. This is due less to
the intrinsic value of the field than to
the lack of some combined scheme for
its fuller development. Following the
denouement of a few months back re-
garding the high-priced options—these
were on the verge of acceptance as the
result of several optimistic reports to
which publicity had been given, but were
definitely settled by C. G. Gibson’s un-
published report to southern share-
holders —cos. have been scratching ex-
tensively to develop further reserves.
Golden Surprise, which has made a thor-
ough sampling and pushed on develop-
ment, announces the discovery of another
new reef. It was the only co. to record a
crushing last month, 365 tons yielding
3360 z. bullion. But the value, including
the premium, was only 435. per ton,
owing to the high percentage of silver
present. Amalgamation of the three
main groups has been in the air since
Gilson’s visit. On an equitable valuation,
and with the North Arm and Golden
Wonder leases included, such a scheme
looks as if it could keep at least a 10-
head mill pretty constantly in commis-
sion from the jump. Certainly, with so
many small, scattered reefs in a re-
stricted area, amalgamation would be best
for the field, and probably also for share-
holders.
* * * *
The Hodgkinson goldfield (N.Q.),
which had many fine crushings over 40
years ago, is coming back into the pic-
ture. Amongst many of the old mines
taken up again are the Tyrconnell and
the Comstock. Oliver Reece has taken
up leases totalling 340 acres, and Roland
Blanchard (Mt. Isa geologist) has lately
been giving them a sampling tryout. An-
other recent visitor to the field was H.
Coldham, lately g.m. at Mt. Coolon. It
looks as if Gold Mines of Australia may
give a couple of the areas a thorough
testing. A small battery has just been
completed on the Golden Crest, making
the total four for the entire field. Half
a dozen shows are producing on a small
scale.

Publication of Government Geologist
J. H. Reid’s report that there are good
reasons for believing that the Monkland
productive shales are present throughout
the Sovereign area has been followed by
a rush for ground at Gympie. D. C.
Dowling, who already has 50 acres on
the Inglewood line, has applied for an-
other 50 acres, said to embrace the Syd-
ney, Walton, Mt. Pleasant, Ellen Hark-
ness, East Ellen Harkness and St. Kilda
reefs. The south-western boundary of
the new area abuts on the projected line
of the Inglewood from where it outcrops
near Normanby Bridge. In 1884 the
Ellen Harkness yielded 14,7280 z. of gold
from 2177 tons. Many efforts have since
been made to find an extension of this
rich strike.
* * * *
A new Gympie syndicate has taken
over the Laycock and Veitch at Yabba
Creek, on the old Gorgum goldfield, 16
miles from lmbil (Q.). The shaft is down
50ft., and a recent crushing of 4| tons,
yielded 15ioz. of gold. The main reef
has been traced on the surface for 750 ft.,
carrying payable values throughout, and
averaging about 6ft. in width. Two
smaller reefs run parallel. A battery is
to be erected.
* * * *
The New Development Prospecting Co.
has dropped its options on the old Wool-
gar goldfield, 85 miles north of Richmond
(N.Q.), without taking out a crushing.
Nevertheless, many of the old shows
give promise; these include Ironclad,
Federal, Nil Desperandum, Red Terror,
Silvery Wave and Big Reef, all regular
producers in the early days. Since the
revival, none has been worked below
water level, yet in most cases there are
indications that the reefs continue at
depth. Crushings in the early days aver-
aged about loz. Gold was first dis-
covered on the field in 1897, and to date
some £50,000 worth has been recovered.
There has been little work done there
since 1920.

Owing to the rise in the price of the-
metal, and lowering of costs, Carpathia
Tin, Ardlethan (N.S.W.), resumed mining
operations in May last. Prior to that
the show had been let on tribute.
Accounts for the half-year to July 31
show a loss of £427. Creditors figured
for £77 ; liquids, including stocks, totalled
£1690. The market prices the 10s. paid
shares at 3 s. 6d.

Western Deep Leads’ (Vic.) No. 1
tunnel is in 260 ft., and driving con-
tinues in 3dwt. dirt along a bar
in the old river bed. Crosscutting will
begin when the bed flattens out. At Nos.
2 and 3 sites the tunnels have been driven
220 ft. and 226 ft. respectively, but thus
far the wash is unpayable ; hopes are
that satisfactory values will show up
when the main bed of the river is
reached.

Western Mining Corp. intends to first
look for likely auriferous and other
mineral belts on its big concessions in
Westralia from the air. The search will
cover some 88,000 square miles of coun-
try, and Hemming and Partners, of Lon-
don, have been given the job. The co.
is backed by a powerful group of Aus-
tralian and overseas mining interests. Its
principal shareholders are North Broken
Hill, B. H. South, Zinc Corp., Electrolytic
Zinc, Imperial Smelting Corp., Central
Mining and Investment Corp., Case
Pomeroy and Co., Union Corp. and
New Consolidated Goldfields.

The 24-acre Iron Duke lease, recently
purchased by Goldfields Australian De-
velopment from Associated Northern for
£10,500, has been one of Kalgoorlie’s
best gold-producers. So far £2,179,879,
mostly obtained from a section of the
famous Brownhill Oroya shoot, has been
extracted from it. Though there is little
now in sight, the show is considered to
have possibilities in lateral prospecting.
Associated Northern is also entitled to
a quarter interest in any co. formed to
work the property. Chairman John Wad-
dington thinks this right will turn out
to be worth something.
* * * *
Brown’s Reward Co., which in the past
has not met with much luck in its hunt
for gold in Westralia, is again inviting
the public to come in. An option has
been taken over Kozul and Mullins’s rich
find, near Menzies, which recently
yielded £15,000 worth of gold. The pur-
chase price is £17,000 cash and 15,000
fully-paid shares. A deposit of £lOOO is
payable Oct. 12, £9OOO, plus the shares,
on Jan. 12, 1934, and the balance (£7000)
out of gold won during the option. There
is some good stuff available alongside
the stone already taken out, but opinion
is divided as to whether the shoot will
live down. The co. proposes to change
its nameplate to Lady Gladys, and to
issue 40,000 shares of 2s. each.

Norseman (W.A.) is offering share-
holders 12,500 new ss. shares at 10s.
each. The money is wanted to duplicate
the gold-recovery plant and provide for
further power. The work, now well
advanced, is expected to occupy about
three months. When complete, it will
enable 2500 tons of crudes to be treated
monthly, and should enhance dividend
prospects. The gold content of 1200
short tons crushed in Aug. was put at
£3700 (gold at £7 an ounce). Sale of
bullion turned in £2119; the difference
is in the tailings, to be treated by the
cyanide plant, now being made ready.
Last week-end the old shares fetched
14s. 7d. in the market.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
Beltana: (1) Hold. (2) Will review accounts
in our next issue... .H.D.: It looks like a blue
duck; another case of plant ahead of develop-
ment H.K.: Much depends upon the coun-
tries involved and the seat of hostilities. Pro-
babilities are that demand would create new
sources of supply, and prices would strengthen.
W.B.: (1) Because the price of the metal
ceased to be fixed by statute. (2) It will be
quite steady at whatever mint par is fixed, and
the price does not look like being the old
statutory price, either. (3) Under the new
monetary law of June, 1928, 526| francs per
fine ounce. At the rate of exchange current
on Oct. 5, this was equal to £6 13s. Bd. sterling.
Novice: The co. has not yet turned the
corner, but it is moving in the right direction.
See B. 8/2/’33.


SHADOW SHOWS.
One of the differences between the fan-
tasies of modern Hollywood and Eliza-
bethan England is that the title of a
talkie usually provides material for argu-
ments after the show. “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream” explains itself. But why
“Storm at Daybreak” at the Regent? It
is about the love of Kay Francis, wife
of a Serbian mayor, for Nils Asther, an
officer in the Hungarian army. The
Sarajevo murder is shown in realistic de-
tail. That dates the action, and there
are a few war and folk scenes, but the
thing remains a familiar type of society
problem play in the essentials. The
characters, taken in conjunction with
the surroundings, make it fantastic.
Nils and Walter Huston, village mayor,
are friends. Huston’s warm-hearted,
garrulous, thick-headed, uxorious peasant,
with tousled hair and a moustache that
looks as if the rats had been at it, is
entirely believable, whether in his mangy
top-hat of office, in national garb, or in
the collarless undress which he affects in
the home. But Miss Francis, as the
bucolic mayoress who enslaves Asther
against a sophisticated drawing-room
background, is as fanciful as Titania,
Oberon or any of them. She uses the
same mannerisms as she did in “Trouble
in Paradise.”
The finish is exciting. The villain, a
Serb, proposes to have Asther shot. Hus-
ton has learned with anguish of the loss
of his wife’s affection, but he is touched
and edified by the knowledge that she
hasn’t been technically unfaithful. He
takes the villain for a wild and fatal
drive, and virtuous passion is rewarded.
Eugene Pallette and Louise Closser Hale
supply the comic relief.
“The Girl in 419” is Gloria Stuart,
an underworld queen. She is carried into
James Dunn’s New York hospital in a
bad way, having been put on the spot
by gangsters for knowing too much.
James saves the Madonna-like creature’s
life, and love dawns. The only obstacle
to their happiness is the head gangster,
and David Manners, another medico,
accounts for him on original lines.
This one is a fantasy also. The hos-
pital, the pure-faced heroine, the per-
vasive journalist, the snarling despera-
does, the wise-cracking boy-doctors and
the lovely girl-nurses are obvious myths,
but the eventful proceedings are rushed
through at such a terrific pace that the
spectators have no time to grow analyti-
cal. The operating-theatre sequences are
even more grisly than usual.

In “The Stranger’s Return,” at the
Capitol, Lionel Barrymore is a moneyed
octogenarian who declines to die, though
interested relatives yearn to see the last
of him. Miriam Hopkins, his sweet
orphaned granddaughter, arrives a few
laps ahead of the Reaper, and the oldster
learns to idolise her. They roam happily
together about his barnyard and wheat-
fields. Enter Franchot Tone. He is a
college-bred farmer with a wife and
child. Yet he and Miriam, alas, are soon
all in all to each other. This gives the
relatives their chance to set the patriarch
against his favorite. But he is too much
for them. He pretends to have a mental
breakdown, sees them in their true colors,
leaves his money to Miriam and oblig-
ingly dies. Barrymore is Barrymorish.
Stuart Erwin is as Erwinish as ever.
The cameraman has made good use of
the outdoor scenery at his disposal.
“The Mind Reader” shows Warren
William, first as a vendor of fake medi-
cines, and next as a crystal-gazer. No
one is better in such parts. Poor Con-
stance Cummings is his accomplice. His
vaticinations have a tendency to break
up homes, and one involves him in a
fight which ends in the death of a justly
incensed husband. William bolts and
Miss Cummings is charged with murder.
At this stage the film goes rancidly
sentimental. However, there is so much
humor in the earlier shots that the lapse
may be forgiven.
The carnival scenes at the beginning
are interesting, and the photography is
clever all through.
# ¥ ¥
“Hold Me Tight,” at Melb. State, has
an old-fashioned penny-novelette plot set
to the tragic music of the American eco-
nomic catastrophe. Even its trite senti-
mentality, its obvious bellowdrama and
its author’s comforting conclusion that,
if men and women have hearts of gold
it doesn’t matter if their heads are of
wood, fail quite to smother the grim
symphonic accompaniment of jobless
feet tramping from one employment
bureau to another, of terrified working
women and equally terrified employers.
There is good psychology as well as
tragedy in the shame of the men who
find their women keeping them. This is
about the nearest most Hollywood films
get to a realistic picture of Things as
They Are in Roosevelt’s country.
There is a grand fight at the end in
which James Dunn floors half a dozen
villains and wins a job and Sally Eilers.
Sundry Shows
There used to be a time, even in Aus-
tralia, when people went to the theatre
to see something new, but nowadays the
talkie impresarios, the broadcasters or
the repertorians usually have first cut.
Noel Coward’s comedy “Private Lives,”
presented' at Sydney Cri. on Saturday
night, has had the cream of novelty
skimmed off it by all three processes.
Notwithstanding this, the play went re-
markably well. It is better suited to the
stage than to the screen, and the four
mummers who comprised the cast —the
maid doesn’t count —captured completely
the spirit of the irresponsible and fantas-
tic world in which most Coward charac-
ters live. They toil not, these gay people,
neither do they spin; they have no
interest in any mortal thing outside their
“THE SQUATTER’S
DAUGHTER ”
AT SYDNEY CIVIC.
(Top to bottom, left to right): Claude Turton as the Afghan; Grant
Lyndsay as the Hero; Jocelyn Howarth as the Daughter; Les Warton as the
Bad Man; W. Layne-Bayliff as the Squatter, and Owen Ainley as the Crippled
Brother.
love affairs, and their chatter is as incon-
sequential as the twittering of canaries.
They laugh at life, and when, as hap-
pened on Saturday night, they do it natur-
ally, the audience laughs with them, un-
restrainedly. Its chuckles don’t subside
until some minutes after each curtain.
Isobel Elsom, who plays Amanda, is
an actress of wonderful vivacity, and in
George Barraud, as Elyot, she has an
ideal partner. His screen training makes
him seemingly oblivious of his audience,
and his smooth impertinence appears to
be spontaneous. Harvey Adams, as the
somewhat pompous Victor, gives just
enough flavor of rationality to the pro-
ceedings to emphasise their ridiculousness,
arid Charlotte Frances, in a tearful role,
demonstrates once again her competence
as a portrayer of character.
Staging is nice, the women’s dresses
are pretty, and the bright yellow lighting
in the first act, which is supposed to be
moonlit, may be forgiven on the score
that a clear view of facial expression is
as important, in a Coward play, as dis-
tinct enunciation. To eke out an other-
wise rather short programme, tenor John
Dudley, not required in “The Quaker
Girl”at the Royal till later in the evening,
opens the show by inviting Maud into the
garden and advising young men to take
a pair of sparkling eyes.
* * *
“The Ship of Heaven,” a fantasy by
Hugh McCrae and Alfred Hill, presented
at Sydney Savoy by the Independents is
charmingly conceived, but its presenta-
tion was handicapped by a small stage,
inadequate mechanical resources and the
inexperience of some of the players. There
are delicacy in the love scenes, a pictur-
esque robustness when the magnificent
Sir Gorgeous Gobble stalks across the
stage, sardonic thrusts at modern follies,
and frequent nonsensical interpolations.
The story begins with Colombine being
refused a passage on a ship which takes
“quite nice people” to a happier land.
Pierrot enters, but declines to console her,
and she finally departs in pursuit of the
ship in an aeroplane chartered by Sir
Gorgeous Gobble, a merry old rogue.
Pierrot in the meantime has discovered
that he really adores Colombine —Cupid
did the trick with a golden arrow —and
is left lamenting. He visits “The Doctor’s
Shop” to have the arrow removed. This
scene, which is carried out in panto-
mime, was introduced into the fantasy by
Mischa Burlakov. Dimly lit, cluttered with
fearsome-looking instruments, peopled
by a row of scared, haggard patients
awaiting the attention of the terrifying-
looking doctor, it resembled a mediaeval
torture chamber. Then follow scenes in
a garden inhabited by ghosts, goblins
and human-like flowers, birds and water-
cans. In this setting the lovers are finally
united after many adventures. Alfred
Hill’s music expresses the spirit of the
text. It is smoothly melodious, and
the orchestra, under Hill’s baton, gave
a good account of itself. The vocalists
ranged from the just passable to fairly
good. They included Masie Buchanan
(Colombine), Robert Scott (Pierrot),
Harold Tollemache (Sir Gorgeous),
Pauline Henriques (Soot), Lorna McKean
(Cupid) and Richard Parry (Devil). The
Lightfoot-Burlakov ballet was an effective
aid to the working out of the play, and
Don Finley’s settings were pleasing.
Mahdi McCrae designed the costumes
and Doris Fitton was producer.
* * *
Strindberg in one of his short stories
tells of an elderly couple who, seeking to
revive cherished musical associations,
essayed to play a pianoforte duet arrange-
ment of the opera “Romeo and Juliet.”
It seemed to them a monstrous thing
with no melody in it, and not a single
phrase they could remember. They dis-
covered that their “Romeo and Juliet”
was Bellini’s, and that the score from
which they sought to capture old raptures
was Gounod’s, which came into the field
28 years later than the “Capuletti ed i
Montecchi” of the Italian composer. It
is a rule in the operatic field that the first
composer who scores a big success with a
classic libretto holds his claim against all
comers. For this reason the “Mefistofele”
of Boito, which opened the A.B.C.’s
season of opera, made but very little
appeal. It comes chronologically less
than a decade after Gounod’s “Faust,”
but though it is better opera than
Gounod ever wrote, a veritable mine of
original melodic material and beautifully
attuned to Goethe’s version of the legend,
it does not lend itself to quotation. You
hear Boito’s work in the lump or not at
all, whereas juvenile piano students make
the acquaintance of half a dozen of
Gounod’s “Faust” melodies before they
have mastered half of the ins and outs of
the five-finger exercises. Berlioz was in
the field with a “Faust” 13 years before
Gounod, but only his “Flower Song” is
remembered. Like Boito, he took the
broad view of the legend. The A.B.C.’s
exposition of Boito, conducted by Wando
Aldrovandi, had a very fair orchestral
backing. Faust had at his disposal the
ringing tenor notes of Lionello Cecil.
Leonore Gotsch, a dramatic soprano of
considerable vim, voiced the woes of
Margherita, and Signor Izal was Mefisto-
fele.
* * *
“Road House,” at Melbourne King’s,
is a masterpiece in one particular: no-
thing so complacently idiotic has been
offered to the dwindling band of legit,
diehards locally for a decade. The plot
has straws in its hair, and the character-
isation deserves honorable mention in the
“Who’s Who” of Theatrical Imbecilities.
In the last act, which is sillier than the
second, which, in turn, is more fatuous
than the first (incidentally, the first has
'much unfulfilled promise in it which
makes the subsequent debacle more dis-
tressing), there is a corpse —the second
murder of the evening. The cadaver is
propped up at a table, and sundry char-
acters have drinks around it. This inci-
dent strikes as merry a note in a musical
comedy without the music as would a
live catfish served up with the soup in
a St. Kilda boarding-house. Strange to
relate, Dot Brunton, as the daughter of
a public-house lady who runs away with
an English lordling, was never more
spontaneous or charming. She almost
gives coherency to the muddle. With
tireless energy and invention she exploits
every possibility for comedy in a piece
not conspicuously blessed with the
article. In the throwback in the first act,
where she appears behind the bar as her
own mother, her naivete is delicious.
Frank Bradley, Carl Harbord and Leon-
ard Stephens also provide some amiable
farce, and John Fernside is crisply amus-
ing, but without making sufficient
amends for the hero of John Longden,
the villain of John D’Arcy and sundry
distressing female characters. Walter
Hackett, who unblushingly answers guilty
to the charge of authorship, is said to
have compiled his Nitwitaker’s Almanac
of dramatic incompatibilities especially
for his wife to play in. If so, it must
have been in retaliation for the box of
cigars she gave him on his birthday.
* * *
Last week Melbourne’s Little Theatre
crossed the Yarra and stormed the city,
effecting a landing at the Kelvin Hall
with J. B. Priestley’s “Dangerous Cor-
ner.” The performance was mainly not-
able for the good acting of Betty Tait,
of the well-known theatrical family. The
play is mainly mediocre, but Miss Tait
carried conviction as the understanding
wife of a man whose brother has osten-
sibly committed suicide, and who insists
on everybody connected with the fatality
telling the truth about it. In the book of
revelations that follows almost every
variety of sexual irregularity is touched
on without anything being definitely
elucidated. The conclusion come to is
that sleeping dogs should lie. Jack Wilt-
shire, Avis Crawford, Frederic Speight,
Brett Randall and Jean Campbell handled
their parts adequately, while Margaret
Reid’s sympathetic rendering of hers was
all the difference between an actress and
a woman.
# * *
Adelaide Repertory has given two
showings to four new short plays. Two
are light—one a Milne. One is real Rep.
work by N. K. Smith on Pirandello lines
—Pierrot and comrades who “refuse to be
resurrected,” but who speak as the
silent author writes, hesitate when he
thinks, and withdraw their remarks when
he scratches out. Young players, with
Betty Diamond prominent, made all this
funny as well as clever. “The Return,”
by a leading local Repertory member
modestly anonymous, deals with a Bad
Man, visited by the mocking spirit of his
own youth. In this Oscar Wilde sort of
fantasy Fred James and young Ronald
Corney were powerful.

ABORIGINALITIES
“P.G.”: It happened in Northern
Queensland. Jacky, Mary, Tommy and
Nellie having worked for three consecu-
tive months on the selection, brushing
and falling, the strain of civilised life
began to tell, and they informed the boss
they had decided to go for a walkabout.
So a party consisting of a dozen adults,
piccaninnies of varying hue and 49 in-
describable dogs set out on the peregrina-
tion, and for some time nothing was seen
or heard of them. Then one day when
the boss was away in town there came a
knock at the door. The missus, on going
to investigate, found Nellie and a friend
holding between them a strangely bulging
chaff-bag from which came an awful
smell. After several minutes of wildly
gesticulatory explanation she gathered
that Mary had died, had been dead about
ten days, was now in the chaff-bag and,
“And don’t forget there’s a hundred pound for anyone who’ll keep his head
in the man-eatin’ tiger’s mouth for one minute.”
with permission, was to be planted on
the selection. The missus assured them
that they had full freedom to bury Mary
anywhere outside a radius of a hundred
yards from where they stood, and the
abos. retired to a chorus of “Good
pfeller, missus.” The missus also retired
—to be violently ill.
* * * *
“Pat Bushie”: I was holidaying at
Cudgen, on the Tweed, North Coast
(N.S.W.), and had half a dozen lines,
baited with as many varieties of bait, in
the water for full three hours one morn-
ing without so much as even a nibble.
Presently a little abo. youngster came
up and, with a wide grin, asked, ‘“Spare
me a bit of bait, mister?" He only
grinned wider when 1 said, “No use,
sonny; they’re not biting." -“Just one
little bait, please, mister,” he persisted.
“Righto ; take your pick.” He selected
a little piece of butterfish, threw in
alongside me, and after a moment I saw
him grin again. He hauled in a 31b. flat-
head. “Give you a bob for it,” 1 offered,
but he shook his head and marched off
with his trophy.
* * * *
“Black Mountain”: Dave had wired
that he was coming home and would be
bringing a friend. The friend turned out
to be a bride, and though the family
took to Mrs. Dave it was a little hurt at
the secrecy. The journey had tired the
lady out, so she retired early, while Dave
sat up and talked. “I couldn’t get out of
it,” Dave explained. “We was sitting on
the settee one night when Hilda says
‘Will yer marry me, Dave? Have yer any
objection?’ Yer see, Dad, whether I said
‘yes’ or ‘no’ I was a goner.” “Yer damn
fool,” Dad remarked, “the only thing to
do was to keep yer mouth shut.” “That’s
just what J did do,” explained the bride-
groom, “and she flings her arms round
me neck and says ‘Silence gives con-
sent, Dave! ’ ”
* * * *
“The Mark”: I was looking in a
Castlereagh-street shop-window, won-
dering where there was a market for the
stuff they sell therein, when a shade
materialised at my elbow. “Mister,” it
said, “can you spare tuppence for a cup-
pertea.” I stiffened, even as the pointer
stiffens when he sights his quarry, or the
earthworm when a starling plucks his
tail. I became deaf and dumb and men-
tally (so I thought) impregnable, but I
used my eyes. The shade was very small
and frail. The voice went on to state
“Mister, this is the very first time I done
such a thing.” Myself said to myself
“Scrooge!” and 1 was reaching for a
florin when that small, depressed figure
turned away. “Hold on,” I said, and
then, prompted by the imp of mischief,
“I’m as hard up as you are. What luck,
brother?” A funny little wizened old
face peered up at me from under the
brim of an ancient felt hat and a two-
bob piece was thrust at me. Under the
hat were two eyes so bright and bird-
like and so young to have stood the 70
years or so that must have graved the
lines in that deeply-wrinkled countenance
that under their hypnotic influence I
parted with six bob. At this stage there
should have come along a friendly detec-
tive-sergeant to inform me that 1 had
been the victim of “Solly the Smoodger,”
the past-master of the craft, but outside
fiction those anti-climaxes don’t happen.
H= * * *
“Murrungurry”: A matter that might
be worth considering by northerners who
have to go among wild blacks is that
white men who went bush and lived with
the myalls, from Buckley in Victoria to
the classic half-dozen in Queensland, all
had red hair. That color was sacred to
the blacks, because their goddess, the pro-
tector of women, had red hair. It is
claimed that no white man with a rufous
topknot was ever killed by abos. in any
part of Australia. A red head has proved
itself a safer passport among myalls than
even an ambassador’s message-stick.
“’Ave a nice time at the picnic, Billy?”
“You bet! I fell inter the ginger-beer cask, and after that no one wanted to
drink except me.”
“Kariah”: “Verri” (B. 27/9/’33) falls
into a common error when he mentions
the polygamous, or at least gay, ways of
the blue wren. The female birds that
trail him are, with the exception of his
mate, his offspring. In early life both
sexes are of a uniform color, and, owing
to a predominance of females in the
brood, males are seldom seen when tak-
ing on their new plumes.
“Wandi”: Sixty years ago six
red deer—two bucks and four
does —were sent from Windsor
Park, England, to Brisbane, con-
signed to the then Governor,
Lord Normanby, and were re-
leased on the ranges between Kil-
coy and Cressbrook. Thirty
years afterwards there were large
herds in that locality. Closer
settlement decreased the num-
bers, but there are still a good
many on the hills around the
head of the Brisbane River. The
intention was to breed them for
hunting, but the settlers who
went after cheap meat dispensed
with bugles and pink surtouts.
About the same time the first
batch of hares was landed in
Q’land from Melbourne in the
interests of coursing, then a
favorite sport in Vic. and S.A. To-day
hares have become a plague.

“Tiki”: The “Who’s Whos” of Maori-
land tell us little about Tahupotiki
Wiremu Ratana. Scholefield’s says that
he is a farmer and storekeeper near
Turakina ; that he is a Maori healer and
organiser; that he visited England in
1924, and organised a church in 1925.
As a matter of fact, he is the last of
the tohungas. Not by initiation, but by
instinct. His priesthood came upon
him in 1918, in the time of the
“black influenza.” He was a young
farmer, not a chief, though of long line-
age. The terror of those days made
him mad. He saw visions and behaved
insanely. At last he was put in a strait-
jacket and consigned to a mental hospi-
tal. On the brink of the journey he be-
came sane, and was released. He en-
tered on a career of healing—faith-heal-
ing, if you like —but he healed. His
fame spread all over the world, and
money rained in upon him. Peter Moko,
Ratana’s secretary, says that in those
two or three years of the healing mission
£lOO,OOO was received. Most of it was
returned. Then Ratana settled down to
the normal business of a chieftain-
tohunga. He established (some say the
Maoris are a lost tribe of Israel) first a
bank —a bank with a national purpose,
to fight the cause of the Maoris whose
land had been taken from them by
pakeha fraud. He went to England in
1924 to interview King George. His
Majesty was not at home to Ratana, so
the tohunga called at Geneva to have it
out with Sir Eric Drummond. Sir Eric,
also, was not having any. On the way
home Ratana left a visiting card with
the Mikado, and on his return to
Maoriland he founded a church.
Within a few weeks it had 22,000 mem-
bers, 104 ministers, 400 lay preachers
and 40 sisters. Not only that, but
a great many of the ministers were
gazetted as eligible to perform marriages.
Most of the ministers, including Ratana
himself, were removed from the list in-
side 24 months. Subsequent history is
brief. Ratana has founded a town and
an agricultural settlement (it grows splen-
did wheat), and built a great temple. He
is now building a pah at Patea as a
memorial to his ancestor Turi, but is not
personally superintending the job. In the
first week he was there he was pinched
by a pakeha cop for driving a motor-
car while blotto—not the first occasion,
by the way—so he withdrew, first put-
ting a tapu on Patea. His followers are
enjoined not to spend money there in
future.

“Mungo’ - : “Yarri” (B. 20/9/’33) says
that Cecil Freer “one year won the Dar-
win Cup.” Cecil has been racing in the
Northern Territory ever since he was a
boy and has about a dozen of the cups
to his credit, sometimes won with his own
horses. The event in the old days was
the Palmerston Cup, Palmerston being the
original name of Darwin township.
Freer’s last two Darwin Cups were won
on Felix Holmes’s horses.
* * * *
“H.A.L.”: A curious thing about that
part of the S.A. coast between the end
of the Ninety-mile Beach and Cape Jaffa
is that it is always calm, though huge
rollers thunder in on the coast to the
north and south. The reason is that the
sea floor extends out for miles like a shelf
with no greater depth than six fathoms,
and on this grow huge beds of tapeweed
and kelp, which act as a brake on the
waves. As a result, fishing cutters can ride
at their moorings at Kingston when a
furious gale is piling up billows a few
miles away. Countless millions of cray-
fish live in the huge beds of weed, and
there is something about their food
supply which makes them the answer to a
boozer’s prayer. Mullet caught in the
Coorong, a long salt-water lake lying at
the back of the coast between Kingston
and the Murray mouth, are also famous.
Since the Prince’s Highway between
Adelaide and Melbourne was made pass-
able for cars in all weathers, the fame
of the Kingston crays and the Coorong
mullet have spread far and wide, with
the result that you can see cars lined up
during holiday periods waiting for the
fishing-boats to come in.
OLD-TIMER.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
You re sitting alone by the blazing fire,
Thoughtfully puffing your old black briar,
Dreaming away to your heart’s content
Of the sheds you rung and the cheques you
spent
J n tlie far-off days when your eye was bright,
When your pockets were full and your heart
was light,
When you worked all day and you danced all
night.
Old-timer!
Little you cared for the rain or mud,
A pitch-black night or a creek in flood.
With a horse to ride and a cheque to spend
And a drink and a kiss at the journey’s end,
Where red lips pouted and soft hands clung
And the fiddles squeaked and the dancers
swung.
Ah! those were the days when your heart was
young,
Old-timer!
So busy with stockwhip and axe and shears,
You hardly noticed the passing years,
Till your beard was grey and you woke to
find
That somehow or other you’d dropped behind;
And the girls you had flirted and danced with
then
Had married or drifted beyond your ken,
And you couldn’t keep pace with the younger
men,
Old-timer!
But what does it matter? You did your best,
And if life lacks most of its old-time zest,
There’ll be someone waiting to ease your load
When you reach the end of the sunset road.
Now all you need is a well-filled briar,
A cosy chair and a blazing fire,
To doze and dream to your heart’s desire,
Old-timer!
VICTORIA.
EDWARD HARRINGTON.


“Homfrey Beale”: Nest frames built of
fencing-wire and similar material by mag-
pies (“Fitz,” B. 27/9/’33) are not un-
common, but I’ve only known one couple
that soared to concrete. On a N.S.W.
station a few years ago a concrete floor
was being put into a killing yard, and the
workmen were annoyed by a pair of mag-
pies swooping on the mixed heap. A few
months later a boundary-rider reported
“a big grey box with shiny spots” high
up on a Barwon gum. Investigation dis-
closed a yard square concrete structure
with domed roof —to let the rain run off
without splashing, we supposed. On one
side was a doorway with a piece of
hinged board, salvaged from somewhere,
let into the concrete. On the floor near
the door was a shearer’s oilcan. The
“shiny spots” were squares of window-
pane glass set in the sides. The walls were
draped with colored silk threads, which
made perfect curtains, and explained the
mysterious “laddering” of many of the
missus’s garments, while on the line. The
centre of the floor was occupied by a
richly and polychromatically upholstered
nest in which three young magpies
squawked vigorously. I secured a photo-
graph, but the infuriated old birds, with
shrieks of “No vulgar publicity,” smashed
my camera as I descended.
* * * #
“Tamornie”: Mention of Paddy Cajiill
of the N.T. in a recent par. reminds
me that it is claimed for Paddy that he
created a record by dropping 45 buffalos
in a “run” of about 30 minutes. Paddy
lent me a horse one day when I intended
riding for squatter pigeons, and assured
me that it was accustomed to shooting.
In my innocence I fired at the first bird
DAD: “I don’t mind y’ ridin’ on the saw, son, but I wish y’ wouldn’t scrape
y’ feet along the ground.”
which rose, and was sitting on the ground
before the pigeon dropped. Paddy had
lent me one of his buffalo-shooting nags,
which had been taught to leap aside at
the report.

“Dai R.”: Few people who haven’t
experienced it realise the quietening effect
of music on stock. Jack Stewart, a
Queensland drover, who has brought
many mobs from the Gulf, never travels
without his bagpipes, and has averted
scores of threatened rushes by their skil-
ful manipulation. “Wilga,” a well-known
half-caste droving hand of nor'-west N. S.
Wales has done the same by a timely
dispensation of mouth-organ music. I
have seen a mob of sheep sleeping
in a brake rise as one to the lure
of concertina, mouth-organ or tin whistle.
Strangely enough horses are less amen-
able than cattle or sheep to music’s thrall.
* * * *
“Biilabong Jim”: The red snake (B.
23/ 8/’33) is no myth. It is common in
the Hughenden (Q.) district, where it is
known among other aliases as the “brown
tree-snake.” Proper name is Boiga fusca.
A remarkably broad head, quite distinct
from the neck, a length of about six
feet and bright salmon-brown coloring all
help to make the practically harmless
creature a fear-inspiring spectacle. By
fancifully-minded folk it is referred to as
the red tiger, spinifex blood‘snake or
scarlet lurker. It is fairly common in
eastern N.S.W., where it is called the
moon snake, in reference to its nocturnal
habits. It dines chiefly on small mammals
and birds.
* * * *
“ Quidseeker ” (Peshawar, India):
“Elaps” (B. 2/ 8/’33), commenting on the
suicide of a double-headed snake, im-
plies that the poison of one colu-
brine snake is ineffective against another
coluber. This is far from the fact. Kraits
can poison cobras, and cobras kraits,
though both are colubers. Fitzsimons, of
the Port Elizabeth (S. Africa) Snake Park,
gives an instance of two colubrine snakes,
a Cape cobra and black mamba, fighting
it out —and both died of snake poison-
ing. If a Russell’s viper and a Phoorsa
(both viperine) came to stabs in real
earnest, I would not give twopence for
the Phoorsa’s chances, nor for Russell’s
either if he was not careful to use his
advantage in reach. Also J deny that
snakes cannot be killed by their own
venom. Venom is a combination of
nerve poison and blood-alterer, and if in-
jected into the blood stream there is no
physiological reason why it should not
upset its owner’s internal economy. As
regards the double-headed snake con-
troversy, one of these freaks lived for a
time at Port Elizabeth. It had a bifur-
cated neck, about three inches long, and
was of the back-fanged species, being one
of the Shaapsteku genus ( Psammophis ).
“The aggressive head had bitten the other
repeatedly and injected sufficient venom
to cause death ; and the other had re-
taliated.” I quote from the report on
the inquest.
* * * *
“Barangkali”: Visitors to Java are
sometimes curious as to the purpose of
the long pronged poles that can be seen
leaning against the walls in the native
bazaars. When the shout of “Amok”
rises through the crowded alleys and the
natives scatter in all directions, the value
of the poles quickly becomes apparent.
An affair of the heart, a loss at gambling
or the death of a favorite fighting cock
—any of these is a sufficient reason for
Ahmat to throw off the veneer of civilisa-
tion and commence killing until he him-
self is dead. At the first signs of an amok,
one of Java’s miniature policemen grabs
the nearest pole and goes in search of the
disturber of the peace. The next part of
his job, usually a ticklish one, is to pin
the amok against a wall with the pronged
pole, its length preventing the crazed man
from doing any damage with his razor-
sharp parang or kris. Moral persuasion
is rarely successful, and usually the long
cutlass with which all Javanese police are
armed is brought into action.
“Dr. Mivart”: After a cursory study
of the mathematics of relativity, which
lead one so far into the interstices of the
calculus and metaphysical geometry that
most of us are tempted to take them for
granted, I am almost convinced that I
have a clue to the commonest feature of
dreams. I don’t refer to the art of levita-
tion, nor to the
horror of being
unclothed or un-
suitably clothed —
though the times I
have trudged down
city streets bare-
footed recur to me
every time 1 fail,
even from the
most scientific
motives, to lead
out trumps. The
strongest nexus be-
tween relativity
and dreams is the
way in which times
and localities
merge. Many and
many a time have
I, clad in pyjamas,
sauntered cheer-
fully down Fleet-
street, pointing out
to Dr. Johnson its
many improve-
ments. We dodge
down a lane which
1 recognise after-
wards as an
obscure right - of-
way belonging to
Sydney, and then
go shopping in that
four - mile - long
thorough fare
Colombo - street,
that bisects Christ-
church (M.L.). We
usually wind up
(Dr. Johnson hav-
ing become Frank
Harris, who turns
out, on closer in-
spection, to be
Dick Harris) in a
region that I can’t
place at all. It’s
a whole city block, a bit off the main
street, where the shops are stocked with
goods of a quality I haven’t seen these 40
years. Its streets seem more real to me
than many I have seen in waking life
during the last six months. But that’s one
of the mysteries of dreams. A locality
visited once in dreamland seems as fami-
liar as if it had been visited seven times
seven.
* * * *
“M.L.C.”: One of the loveliest birds
of N. Australia —it has also been
observed as far south as
Greensborough (Vic.) —is the
rainbow-bird, which, with its
green coat, black tail and
bright orange throat, well
deserves its name. The adult
bird, in addition, sports two
long projecting tail feathers
which cause it to be some-
times called the spear-tail.
Unfortunately it is also
known as the bee-eater, and
is so unpopular with apiar-
ists that it is usually shot on
sight. The bee-men com-
plain that it chooses a site
for its nest —which is to be
found in a sandy bank some-
times 2ft. deep —in the line
of flight between the apiary
and the fields or lies in wait
on the wire fences for the
foraging bees. Being quick
on the wing, it easily cap-
tures a bee, hits it a couple
of times on the wire, gobbles
it down and darts off for an-
other. On wet days birds
haunt the apiary and pounce
on any bee that shows out.
White, in his “Natural His-
tory of Selborne,” tells of
a half-witted boy who used
to catch and eat the bees for
their sweet flavor, and the
rainbow-bird appears to have
acquired the same taste, for
he is said to disdain any other insect if
bees are available during the six months
he is with us.
“Sixenate”: The threat of a poultry-
farmer that he will shoot at the New
England Airways ’planes which fly over
his property is the first passionate out-
break of his kind in Australia ; but in
England a multitude of chook-valets are
making bitter complaint about the
interference of flying machines with their
business. Mrs. Hen, alarmed at the pass-
ing of the giant hawk, has her mind taken
completely off the production of eggs ; or
she may decline to bring chickens into
the world to feed the maw of this raven-
ing monster. A few farmers claim to
have overcome the difficulty by hatching
out their chickens in houses where whirr-
ing machinery accustoms them to the
noises of aeroplanes, so producing an
aircraft-resistant breed.

“Max”: “W.P.’s” dulice (B. 27/9/’33)
is the seaweed dulse, Gaelic duileasg, long
“Trousers shrunk, eh? Why not let ’em down a hit?”
“I done it till I got sore siftin’ on the buttons.”
known to the Irish and Scottish as a
relish for food or a delectable chew. It
is one of the red seaweeds, varieties of
which are known also to Icelandic and
Mediterranean people, who use it in
cookery. The Celts dry and chew it with
much appreciation—and probably great
benefit to health and teeth. Most sea-
weeds are charged with iodine, a valuable
chemical almost entirely missing from
our overcooked civilised diets. Maoris
also were great seaweed chewers. “W.P.”
is not likely to come across dulse very far
away from Irish and Scottish coasts, but
even if it were procurable here Austra-
lians prefer Yankee chewing-gum.
* * * *
“Larrapinta”: With all deference to the
great Von Frisch, quoted by “M.L.C.”
(B. 27/9/’33), it doesn’t matter a rap
what color beehives are painted, because
bees are to all intents and purposes color-
blind, and use trees, bushes, stones and
tufts of grass as landmarks. The reason
bee-keepers paint their hives different
colors is that they paint a third of the
hives every year, and by varying the color
each year they know which are due for
repainting when the time comes round.
'fc H*
“M.L.C.”: Plants respond to the action
of light by directing leaf-bearing shoots
upward and roots downward. Some in-
sects and animals are also under compul-
sion to obey light. It appears stupid for
moths and insects to continue to buzz
round a lamp that scorches them, but
they have no more control over their
flight than a man in mid-air can help fall-
ing to the ground. They are so con-
structed that the action of the light on
their eyes affects their muscles and drives
them in that direction. The caterpillars
of the goldtail moth- have curiously
adapted this instinct to their particular
needs. They leave their nests on the
stems of leafless shrubs when the weather
becomes warm and are stimulated to
travel upward to the light, where they
find the birst buds opening, on which they
feast. Having fed, they are released from
their bondage to light and can crawl
where they please. Otherwise they would
be forced to remain on the top twigs and
starve.
* * sjs
“Plankton”: “Eoee” (B. 27 / 9/’33)
questions my statement that Lyccemdce
caterpillars eat ant-grubs. F. P. Dodd, of
Kuranda (Q.), has said “I am quite satis-
fied myself that they do” ; Dr. R. J. Till-
yard mentions the fact without comment,
and the late Dr. T. A. Chapman, who dis-
sected caterpillars of the English “Large
Blue,” a species associated with the
yellow ant, proved beyond doubt that the
contents of the former’s intestines con-
sisted solely of ant larvae.

And sisters, too, beneath our skins,

From talkie queens to squaws and gins.
And since mere birth no more is bar
To any prize that merit wins,
Why not an abo. M.H.R.?
The Nordic stock is man, no more;
And who shall rate as less than man
The Indian of Labrador,

Or any other nomad clan
In forests deep or deserts far

Why not an abo. M.H.R.?
Each year democracy deletes
Dividing lines that grow antique;

And bids the lowly and the meek
Step boldly up their piece to speak
On disabilities that mar

THE BROKEN GAMBLER.
Well, the excitement is over, and I am
penniless, ruined, utterly destroyed. I ask
myself bitterly was it worth it—the tact-
ful probing for stable information, the
just indignation at the bookies’ starved
prices, the mad elation as my selection
looked like winning for a few seconds,
the black despair at the news that he
had finished twelfth.
There were two other occasions when a
fortune had seemed within my grasp.
And on both those occasions it eventually
eluded me. Great heaven, the agony of
“Waiter, what do you expect me to open these eggs

mind, the despair of heart and soul that
I went through last week! There were
moments when I felt like, walking to the
harbor ( walking is right). and ending
it all.
And yet, perhaps, the wild ecstasies of
hope made it all worth while. True, I
lost every penny of my fortune, but some-
how I think I’ll save up another 4s. 6d.

Dear Infuriated, —You don’t say who
or what you are, which complicates an
otherwise simple task. For example, you
may be an elderly person desirous of
specialising in Worthiness. If so you
must,force your way, without compunc-
tion, on to some commit-
tees. I have heard the
Tiny Tots’ Anti- Vice

Spaces for Pekes’ Associ-
ation well spoken of by
ballyhoo specialists. Once
you are on a few promi-
nent committees the “S.
M. Herald” may be relied
on to do the rest.
Again, you may be a
flapper anxious to emulate
the feats of your shrewder
sisters. In that case, it is
necessary to get your
photograph in the “Sun”;
and don’t forget that den-
tifrice grin. Supply par-
ticulars of the rhinoceros-
hide suit, with slave
choker of hammered
blisse, barbaric boucle
weaves, Abyssinian nigger
cap and 7 Eskimo’s fish-
scale shoes with matching
adornments of sea-lion’s
teeth which you mean to
wear at the Architects and
Builders’ Picnic. Send in
lists of parties, with your
name amongst those
present, irrespective o f
whether you were present or not, and be
firm about having them published.
(N.B. —Employ the same tactics if you
happen to be married.)
Are you a painter, Infuriated? Then
the “S. M Herald” alone can help you.
Buy an.“lmpolite Letter-writer.”. Study
it carefully. Write to the “S.M.H.” in-
sulting somebody:—preferably a member
of a rival art school. Stress that your
sole concern is the sacred cause of Art.
Persuade some other publicity merchant
to refer to your approaching exhibition.
Write insulting somebody else. Keep it
up till the editor gets sick of it. Let a
month or so pass, and then do it all over
again.
I have dismissed as unthinkable the
possibility of your being a K.C., a Syd-
ney lecturer-journalist, an Australian

Study the strategies of these Napoleons

against obscurity, and you will soon have
total strangers referring to you by your

The Young Communist was in the
midst of a fighting speech against the
fighting spirit. In eloquent terms he
assailed the catterpillistic British Empire
and its accursed millingtarism. Sud-
denly, disconcertingly from the back of
the hall came a discordant note: a
deafening raspberry.
I happened to be in the street later
when the Young Pacifist emerged. He
marched up to a smaller child and
grabbed his coat collar.
“That was you, Young Stinker Magee,
wot chiacked me while I wuz speaking.
No good you tellin’ lies, becos I seen yer,
an’ so did me farver! ” Smack !
Nursing an ensanguined nose and
howling like a dog Master Magee with-
drew, another victim of the great illusion
that those who slang-whang the fighting
spirit are ipso facto devoid of it.

DRINKS ALL ROUND.
The morning air was chill, and the
lieges shivered and gathered their gar-
ments about them. They were there
to see Sir Richard Putter die.
And now the famous exponent of ye
royal and ancient game heaves in view,
accompanied by a chaplain, the heads-
man, the president and committee of his
club and the amateur champion. The
golfing knight surveyed the scene with a
fearless eye.
“Verily,” he remarked to the execu-
tioner, “your eye and hand were the
better for a few practice swings.” And
then: “May I inquire what is bogey?”
The axeman rubbed his chin suspi-
ciously. “Three,” he grunted. “Why?”
“Bah! Black Ned did a two here last
week.”
Resolutely the headsman took his
stance, using the McParritch overhand
grip, at the same time making up his

looking up vacuously from the basket.

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Chatham was unbeaten in Sydney last
spring, and he has been unbeaten this
spring. His five wins in succession bring
the prize-money he has won for A. E.
Blair to £10,340 15s. His effort in captur-
ing the Craven Plate for the second time
was that of a great horse. He looked
well beaten a furlong from home, but
Jim Pike fairly lifted him to victory over
Kuvera and Lough Neagh. The Craven
Plate is one of Pike’s lucky races, as he
has won the event three times. Last
year he could not accept the mount on
Chatham ; he was suspended on Metrop.
day, Jim Munro piloting Chatham.
Dermid’s comfortable victory in the
Suburban Handicap, where he downed
Whittingham (third in the Epsom), Ran-
chero and Turbine (fourth in the Epsom),
demonstrated that he would have been
Chatham’s most dangerous opponent had
he got away with the field in the Epsom.
He was as far ahead of Whittingham and
Turbine as Chatham was, and he had
something in hand. This fellow is a really
good horse, but he has been unlucky in
big handicaps.
The Randwick Plate proved a washout.
Rogilla was made a present of the affair,
as Darby Munro stole the race when he
dashed the chestnut away at the top of
the straight. Lough Neagh was the un-
lucky runner; his rider, Tanwan, was
apparently tied up with instructions. Any-

way, Lough Neagh gave Rogilla an im-
possible start, with the result that he
failed to bridge the gap by a length.
Topical was a fair third, but Silver Scorn
ran poorly. She was backed, as usual,
and the money for her enabled some
sportsmen to get evens about Rogilla,
who went out at 11 to 8 on. It took them
3min. 45;|sec. to crawl over the two miles.
Burlesque was a cheap yearling at 60
guineas. His success in the Clibborn
Stakes was his second at the meeting and
his fourth altogether. This Seremond —
Gay Song colt was bred at the Lyndhurst
stud, Queensland, and is owned by a Leger
bookmaker, Harry Thomas, and Rand-
wick sportsman G. F. Bush. Deputy
Ruler’s withdrawal owing to lameness
assured Burlesque’s favoritism. He opened
at 5 to 2, touched 7 to 4, and started at
twos. It was no race, as Burlesque was
cantering all the way to win easily from
the pacemaker, Dromos, and Journal.
Burlesque’s stable-mate Wexford had
good support at eights, but faded out in
the run home.
Lady owners were to the fore in the
Canonbury Stakes, as Pasha, raced by
Mrs. M. Gearin, and Gladswood, who
carries the colors of Mrs. Spencer Brun-
ton, ran first and third. Gladswood,
backed from threes to 5 to 4, would
have won had he left the barrier decently.
He jumped back, was hopelessly placed
at the top of the straight, but came home
like a true racehorse on the outside of
the field. The winner, who started at
eights after fives had been taken, is a
smart-looking black colt by Rampion
from an English-bred mare, Turkish
Holiday, and cost 180 guineas. The
runner-up, Robber, a stable-mate of
Sonny, owned by pastoralist C. M.
Sawyer, is a bold galloper by Brazen,
sire of Shakuni and Kuvera, and, barring
accidents, is certain to win races.
Oro, with Bst. 41b., was nicely handi-
capped in the Waverley, 14 furlongs. He
had only four moderates to beat. Backed
from twos to 5 to 4, Hunter White’s
chestnut had no trouble in defeating the
consistent Dalmatic and Cherbourg.
Broad Arrow was reckoned to have a
good chance, but his rider would not let
him go until the race was as good as
over. He evidently carried out his in-
structions too literally, as he allowed Oro
to run past him at the three furlongs.
With his light weight, Broad Arrow
would have done better had he been in
front. In the Metrop. the Treclare geld-
ing was always prominent.
Trainer Peter Riddle saddled up three
in the Final Handicap, and the betting
proved that his judgment was correct
when he plumped for Magnitas (sixes),
who beat the favorite, Bold Boy, nicely,
with Satmoth third. Magnitas is in the
Caulfield and Melbourne Cups with 7st.
71b. Like most of the stock of Magpie
he can stay. He has been specked in
doubles ending with Hall Mark and
Rogilla. Mince Pie showed up pro-
minently while her condition lasted, and
the Dominion gelding Master Brierly was
doing his best work at the end.
* * * *
For Randwick on Saturday:
Brush Hurdle: Birthday Present; next,
Master Colin.
Flying Handicap: Multudo; next,
Vista.
Novice Handicap: Astute ; next, Silver
Song.
Two-year-old: Myra Tip; next,
Robber.
City Tatt.’s Handicap: Wicklow ; next,
Bold Boy.
Club Welter: Aussie’s Delight; next,
Mountain View.
Wheriko, Eric Connolly’s Vic. Derby
and Melbourne Cup candidate, did not
lose friends because of his failure to win
the Stand Handicap at Flemington.
Before her Melbourne Cup success as a
three-year-old, Sister Olive was beaten
in the Stand Handicap by Stare. In being
sent out at 9 to 4 in a field of 28 from
No. 21 barrier position, the Night Raid
colt was paid a high compliment. Under
adverse conditions he ran an excellent
race.
Few horses now in training can
begin quicker than Wheriko. Before a
furlong had been traversed he was close
to the front and dropped into a con-
venient place on the rails; but over the
last half-mile the leaders would not open
out, and Ashley Reed had to continue
waiting for a chance to get through.
Wheriko finished third, half a length
behind Glenvarloch, who lost to Petau
by two lengths. The gameness with which
Wheriko responded to his rider’s calls
shows him to be a thoroughbred of class.
Though now four years old, Petau had
not captured a race prior to Saturday.
However, he finished second to Glen-
varloch in the S.A.J.C. Fisher Handicap.
The Manfred gelding conceded him 81b.,
and they met on practically the same
terms in the Stand Handicap. Petau is by
Cyklon (sire of Trivalve) from Begonia,
a sister to the dam of Chatham. At
7st. 41b. in the Caulfield Cup and 7st.
in the Melbourne Cup, Petau is nicely
weighted for a four-year-old stallion.
Lady Reynard (1922) was the last filly
to annex the Maribyrnong Plate at Flem-
ington. Hustle On may do the trick this
spring. Judged on week-end form she
is the fastest juvenile in training in Vic-
toria and perhaps in the Commonwealth.
Six to four in a field of 23, she led all the
way, and scored by four lengths from
two 50-to-l chances, Miss Arin (by
Boyarin) and Queen Helen (by Chief
Ruler) ; then the stewards fined Daniels
£25 for not having kept her on a straight
course. Hustle On is one of 16 fillies
bought at the last yearling sales by Fred
Foulsham for A. G. Hunter, who retained
Hustle On and leased the remainder to
other sportsmen. She is by Baralong
(sire of Coonband) from Ascalon, by
Sarchedon from Galtee Princess, and is
proving a great bargain at 150gns. Hustle
On covered the 4j furlongs in 53jsec.
Division winners in the colts and geld-
ings’ event, Shadow Man and Colling-
wood, occupied 55£sec. and 55isec. re-
spectively. Shadow Man is by Australian
Sun from Kanchani, who belongs to the
same family as Auraria and Aurum ;
Collingwood is by Magpie from Bright
Potts.
Waltzing Lily was a pronounced favor-
ite for the October Stakes, run at weight-
for-age over a mile, with penalties and
allowances. She appeared to be travelling
within herself near the home turn, but
snulfed out as soon as the straight was
entered. Taking this form in conjunction
with her Victoria Park failure, it is clear
that Waltzing Lily has had enough ol
racing for the time being. L’Elite sur-
prised by leading to within a stride of the
judge’s box, where Middle Watch
swooped down to score by a head in gal-
lant style. Middle Watch is thoroughly
sound again and may restore the for-
tunes of Tindall by victory in one of the
Cups. Gaine Carrington came home well
to run third, but his display was not
nearly so impressive as that of Middle
Watch.
* * * *
For Caulfield on Saturday:
Caulfield Stakes: Middle Watch.
Guineas: Hall Mark.
Herbert Power Handicap: Peter Jack-
son ; next, Petau.
Toorak Handicap: Dermid; next,
Whittingham.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
A stranger calling himself “The Red
Shadow” met King Elliott at Leichhardt
on Saturday. Crimson boots, mask and
trunks and a fine physique were all he
had, and Elliott beat him by two falls to
none, after treating his man indulgently.
The Shadow was a policeman, and doubt-
less a good policeman. But not even
Lurich could have made him look like a
wrestler.
' * ’ * * *
“Tom Cribb”: Australians learned
with genuine regret of the death of W.
L. (“Young”) Stribling, who was here
last year, and whose fight with Ambrose
Palmer at Sydney Stadium roused so
much interested discussion. Stribling’s
fighting methods did not meet with
general approval on this side, though he
only practised the American-school style
which was responsible for him as a
boxer. He differed much from many, of
hrsj American contemporanes in being
willing to take on anybody at any time
in the ring His fights in London and
Pans against the vast Camera are wo
cases in point Smashed up in a motor-
cycle accident the fine, handsome, en-
gaging fellow died after an operation.
Footbrawl
The Rugby League Kangaroos had their
long run of success in club games broken
at Manchester on Saturday, when they
met the Northern Union in the first Test
of the tour and were beaten 4-0. Neither
side managed to cross the other’s line,
and the scores came from two penalty
goals by the English captain, J. Sullivan.
The Australians had none the better of
the luck, for the match was played in
drizzling rain with a greasy ground and
ball, conditions which suited the accus-
tomed opposition better than the visitors,
who struck their first wet-weather game
of the tour. Apart from Sullivan’s kick-
ing at goal and in play, neither side could
claim superiority. There was a record
crowd of 33,000 and a corresponding
gate.
Ins and Outs
Sydney grade cricket* produced three
century-makers on Saturday, one, of
course, being Don Bradman, who ran up
a fast 127 for North Sydney against W.
Suburbs. Kippax ran to 107 for Waver-
ley against Balmain, and K. Frazer, of
Gordon, notched 101 against Marrick-
ville. O’Reilly, of North Sydney, pro-
vided another bowling sensation, taking
seven wickets for 22 runs, four of them
in a row.
* * * *
“Five Ways”: Queensland cricketers
selected to practise for the Sheffield
cricket matches have each received an
official document from the heads. This
states that the selectors have been told
to give special preference to players who
show signs of taking the game seriously
and concentrating on it, to the exclusion
of all else. There was a time when
cricket was looked on as an especially
agreeable pastime, and the idea of giving
up one’s hourly and daily existence to
its cultivation was regarded as proper
only for folk who made their living from
it. The humorless communique is ample
evidence that those days have gone for
ever.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: A feature of the closing
phases of the cricket barge between the
Board of Control and Marylebone has
been the savage attacks on the Austra-
lians by the “Daily Herald,” London’s
Labor journal. This ugly spirit has been
extended to politics and other matters
outside cricket, and for no explainable
reason. Its latest cricket manifestation is
a statement that the Board of Control
had cabled to the M.C.C. an ultimatum
demanding an assurance that bodyline
bowling will be abandoned, and stating
its intention of cancelling the tour if
the demand is not complied with. The
board has replied that the statement is a
wild falsehood, as the text of the cable
will show when the M.C.C. releases it.

"TWO COTTON CORDS... They

they act when put in the little torture

The cords are hooked up, the handle is
turned, the cords are stretched. And
then relaxed. SEE? The cord used in
ordinary tyres does not rebound after
stretching. It droops beaten, and
knows it. But the Supertwist Cord used
in Goodyear Truck and Bus Tyres is so
full of life that it rises right back.

“Look at THAT!”
The life of a tyre depends upon these
inner cords. If they sag and break under
the strain and heat of 25,000 stretchings
an hour on the road they are finished.
But Supertwist Cord, with which Good-
year Truck and Bus Tyres are bodied,
gives you double protection against
blowouts. It stretches and relaxes with-
out breaking and the rubber of every
ply in which the cords are embedded is
specially treated to resist heat. Hence
you get more miles and lowest cost miles
out of Goodyear Truck and Bus Tyres.
You can’t see the inside of a tyre. But
you CAN see the Supertwist Test of the
cord that is used in all Goodyear Truck

Ins and' Outs
“Tomrnac”: A. C. Jones, of Sydney,
has doffed the white coat after 42 years
of umpiring in big cricket. During that
time every player of note since the
golden prime of W. G. Grace and Spof-
forth has passed under his eye. He sides
with most in grading Victor Trumper
as the incomparable batsman —Grace,
Maclaren and even Ranji given in—with
Jack Hobbs as the most successful of
the English stars. Of slip fieldsmen,
A.C. places Jack Gregory first of Aus-
tralians, and wisely does not carry com-
parisons further. The fastest of Aus-
tralian bowlers was “Tib” Cotter, though
friends of Ernie Jones and Jack Scott
are likely to challenge the veteran. The
passing from active service at the cricket
front of A. C. Jones coincides with the
passing of a tradition of cricket which
will probably never be revived. He lived
to see the game played in a spirit of
savage recrimination which, when he first
came to know it well, was about the last
atmosphere which those who knew and
loved cricket could ever dream would
attach to it'.
* * * *
“Hotham”: The Board of Control de-
cided at its Sydney meeting that the 15
men for the Australian XI shall be
selected while the next meeting of the
board is in session at Melbourne next
February. There will be no preliminary
choice of players, and the selectors will
be sent on a tour of the States likely to
furnish the team. The B.M.A. in each
State is to be asked to appoint a doctoi
to examine candidates.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: Rain spoiled the open-
ing matches of Sydney grade cricket, but
gave Australia’s Test bowler, Bill
O’Reilly, a wicket of the kind bowlers
ask for in their prayers. Sodden wet, and
drying under a warm breeze, it helped
William, playing for North Sydney, to
take six Waverley wickets for 18. Waver -
ley had nine down for 43 when a tearful
appeal against the light touched the um-
pires’ hearts and made the match a draw.
In the closing few minutes O’Reilly took
five wickets for a solitary run.
* * * *
“Old Q.”: In these days when one
chuckleheaded amendment of the laws
of cricket follows another, it is refresh-
ing to hear of one worthy of attention.
N. J. Plaisted, president of Toombul, one
of Queensland’s leading clubs, urges the
abolition of the toss for choice of inn-
ings. His idea is that each club be given
equal time for batting on the first day
of a match, this tending to give both sides
an equal go at the wicket, good or bad,
without the result hinging on chance.
The practice would also tend to eliminate
the gambling element involved in tossing
a coin, and for this reason may be
expected to receive the support of the
bishops and various church organisations,.
Racquet and Bawl
“Let”: Ellsworth Vines, whose quaint
idiocyncrasies wk '' here last year de-
lighted the spectators almost as much as
his tennis, has given the management of
the American Davis Cup team in Paris
a telling-off. Ellsworth declares the
players were not allowed out at nights,
save under managerial escort, and even
then had to come in to roost early, visits
to the theatre being cut short half-way
through the performance. Vine suggests
a new manager of a different type for
the next team, and, since the last one
failed to induce his side to bring back the
confidently expected bacon, the Yanks
are pretty certain to take his advice.
* * * *
“Cut Shot”: The British tennis players
promise to be an even bigger attraction
that the spectacular Americans, for the
performances of Crawford and his mates
abroad have greatly increased interest in
the game. The meetings between Craw-
ford and Perry will be the star turns.
Applications for reserved seats in Sydney
are coming in already. The Australian
body has extra reason for feeling good,
since it has made a profit of some £6OO
on the Davis Cup tour —the first re-
corded in the long series.
* * * *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: While every
other tennis “expert” in Europe and
America has agreed in placing Jack
Crawford at the top of the world’s
players, one Bruce Harris, of London,
puts Perry ahead of him. He gives as a
reason Perry’s defeat of Crawford in
America, when the latter was such a sick
man he could hardly stand up in the
closing sets, and ignores the defeat ot
Perry at Wimbledon and the French
championships by men whom Crawford
later disposed of with ease. Harris is the
press correspondent who toured Australia
with the English cricketers, and subse-
quently published a book extolling the
virtues of Jardine and his men and giv-
ing highly-colored pictures of the Aus-
tralian barracker.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Hotham”: Victoria’s annual A.I.F.
golf tournament in Melbourne this year
drew the record crowd to date, something
over 500 players turning out as compared
with the 70 who faced the starter when
the contest was first held in 1928. Three
THUMPED-OUT PUG: “All right, mum; l promise to come ’ome early in fuchure”
aeroplanes lent an air of verisimilitude to
the warlike atmosphere by bombing
players with bags of flour. The scratch
event was won by W. L. Hope, who re-
cently took the Australian amateur title.
His score of 74 made him one down on
par from a handicap of plus two. W. S.
Houghton, with a 17 handicap, won the
A.I.F. Cup with a net score of seven up
on par.
* * *
“Divot Digger”: It has been definitely
settled that Sarazen will tour Australia in
February and March next. With him will
be Joe Kirkwood, and the pair will play
exhibition matches in the various States,
charging a ss. gate. The Victorian golf
authorities have asked Sarazen to post-
pone his visit on the ground that it may
take the cream off their centenary show.
It has even been hinted that Victorian
clubs will not allow the visitors the use
of their courses should they insist on
butting in on the Cabbage Garden
arrangements, but it is difficult to
imagine such unsportsmanlike action
being taken.
* * * *
“Scottish Queen”: Golf officials are
proverbially born to trouble as the divots
fly upwards, but those of the Gympie
(Q.) club have struck a special brand.
Gympie, a once famous goldfield, has
witnessed a revival. Three companies
have pegged out mining leases on the golt
course, and as that is only 100 acres, and
each lease comprises 20, there is not
much room left for play. The club holds
the ground on mining homestead leases,
and has, therefore, no means of keeping
off legitimate mining enterprises. The
sinking of one shaft has already com-
pelled the shifting of the 10th hole, and
the future is full of gloom.
* * * *
“Baffy”: The Millions Club of N. S.
Wales is turning out at full strength on
October 17 to contest its annual golt
championship. This' is the tenth year ot
the competition, and since the club in-
cludes many well-known players there is
always some attractive golt on tap. The
Australian Golf Club has lent the Ken-
sington course for the day, and the issue
will be fought out with 36 holes of stroke
play. Other events, including handicaps,
will also be staged. The present holder of
the club championship is A. N. Brown,
who has won it five times since the first
meeting in 1924.
Car and Cycle
“Whizz”: John Cobb, the Australian
whose Railton-designed car, intended to
recapture all the track records, was de-
scribed in a recent Bulletin, made a
good start at Montlhery last week. The
car, which has averaged 137.20 m.p.h. at
Brookland, broke three records before a
worn tyre-tread compelled the driver to
pull up —the 200 miles, 1000 kilo-
metres and the three-hour run. The
speed averaged was 124 m.p.h. The re-
cognised record for 24 hours, the par-
ticular item Cobb was after, is 2724 miles
at an average of 113.50 m.p.h.
“Formula”: Our old lake-bed courses
Perkolili and Lake George will have to
look to their laurels. Another of the sort
near Salt Lake City, in the U.S.A., has
lately contributed to the breaking of 14
world’s records, according to Yankee
estimates. The most important set ol
figures was that for 24 hours, 2827
miles being covered, compared with
Marchand and Morel’s 2724 at Mont-
lhery. The car was a 12-cylinder Pierce-
Arrow, and A. Jenkins drove without
relief. The circuit was 50 miles, which
gives a much better chance of hitting up
pace than the one mile 973 yards ring
at Paris. If Jenkins’s performance is con-
firmed, it is probable that Malcolm
Campbell will turn for his next attempt
on the record, for which he is having a
new car built, to this latest discovery.
* * * *
“Kick Starter”: To those maintaining
interest in the ever-changing story ol
motor-cycle records, the recent feat of
the N.S.W. rider Leo Tobin in getting
new figures for the flying quarter should
appeal. Riding, a 3|-h.p. Norton, he
ticked oft' the 440 yards in B.4ssec. That
means a mileage average of 106.5 per
hour, which is a fraction better than Don
Bain’s standing figures.

“Sprocket”: The big Victorian push-
bike races for the professionals and lily-
whites which will be run from Warr-
nambool and Colac to Melbourne on
Saturday are setting all the shrewdies
wondering whether new times will go up.
In the Warrnambool for the cash riders
303 entrants have been given handicaps
up to 70 minutes. “Fatty” Lamb, who
won last year in 6hr. 21min. 18sec. off
scratch for the 165 miles, is again in the
entries. In 1895 J. Carpenter took lOhr.
52min. The 100-mile amateur event
from Colac sees last year’s winner,
E. Milliken, giving a start again to the
field. The men ahead of him are
getting up to 50 minutes, and the nearest
to him is three minutes ahead —which
means he must go for his life from the
start. Last year Milliken averaged 28
m.p.h. for his 100-mile ride, two m.p.h.
better than Lamb over the longer course.
Miscellaneous
“East Cape” : Sydney papers, reporting
a Soccer football match on the New
Guinea mountain goldfields, described it
as the first game of its kind to be played
on the main island of the Mandated
Territory. This is wide of the mark, for
both white and native teams have been
playing the round-ball game at the
Papuan end of the island for years past,
matches against crews of visiting war-
ships and other vessels being fairly
common at such places as Samarai. The
native has taken to the game keenly, and
has developed a fine barracking sense as
well, a stoushing affray which took
place among players and spectators after
a match at Port Moresby not long ago
being well up to civilised standards.

“Stand Off”: The Wallabies made their
Australian landfall at Fremantle last
week, and are to disband in Sydney on
October 12. The returning members of
the side are all fit, and full of praises
for their Afrikander hosts, though not so
enthusiastic about the tremendous train
journeys which were often necessary. The
team is to be given a municipal reception
in Melbourne, and the N.S.W. Rugby
Union is to dine and wine the party at
Tattersall’s Club on October 14.

“Prince’s”: Winter rowing closed in
Melbourne with two long-distance events
for sculls held on the Lower Yarra. The
10-mile spin was won by the State cham-
pion, C. F. Peppier, who took 75 minutes
over it, but that over five miles went to
53-year-old B. G. Kelly, in the fast time
of 34min. 20sec. The veteran won the
Victorian sculling championship 20 years
ago, and has constantly figured with suc-
cess in races over all distances since then.


AT THE RANDWICK RACES.
Next to the officials and the pencillers
and the trainers and the jockeys and the
tote hands and the waitresses and the
oyster-openers and the barmen, the busi-
est man at Randwick during the A.J.C.
spring meeting was Frith, from this office.
He made 33 sketches of familiar figures
on the famous course (which never
looked better); then an urger who said
he had the commission for Cherbourg,
an absolute cert., and 50 to 1, too,
separated him from a pound. When
Frith saw Cherbourg lob in at the tail of
the Metrop. field, he called it a day.
Pillars of the A.J.C. pictured are Colin
Stephen, the chairman (No. 13), as natty
a figure almost as when he used to be an
amateur jockey ; knights Samuel Hordern
(4) and James Murdoch (17), who is in
pretty well everything in Sydney and
knows a good horse when he sees one;
Hunter White (5), breeder, owner and
committeeman ; Walter Brunton (23) and
secretary G. T. Rowe (30), who has
worthily succeeded the late Charlie
Cropper. Samuel Hordern raced Pillie-
winkie and other good ones. He
is chairman of directors of the
A.M.P. and may be the next chairman
of the Commonwealth Bank ; his apti-
tude for finance astonished members of
the board who had thought of him as
just a carefree sportsman.
Officials other than the secretary are
Colonel Farr, his assistant (11), who has
introduced much-needed lectures to
apprentices, and other improvements;
Dudley Smith (14), whose judgments are
sometimes questioned by punters fifty to
a hundred yards from the post, and there-
fore in a perfect position to correct
them ; Tom Nicholson (20), his assistant,
who grew up in the A.J.C. office, leaving
it only to go to the war; G. F. Wilson
(15), shrewdest of handicappers; chief
stipendiary steward Frazer (19), who
never relaxes his vigilance, though these
times they are nearly always trying;
and starter Gaxieu (31), who gets un-
ruly horses away in perfect line with the
sober ones and then recommends that
their nominations be refused in fairness
to the others.
Trainers represented are Fred Williams
(2), who prepared Chatham for the
Epsom and seems to have a mortgage
on that race (A. E. Blair, owner of
Windbag’s beautiful son, is No. 16); J. T.
Jamieson (22), who must shake hands
with himself at the recollection that
Chatham was never right when Ammon
Ra was carrying all before him,' and
William Kelso (29), for whom Topical
ran second in the Metrop. There have
been Kelsos at Randwick for 60 or 70
years. And there is George Price (32),
like Jamieson a Maorilander settled in
Sydney. He has trained many good
horses.
Jockeys limned are Bartle (3), McCar-
ten (9) —both intelligent fellows as well
as capital horsemen —Knox (12) and
O’Sullivan (18), who rode Regal Star so
well in the Metrop. Bookmakers are
McDonald (6) and Matthews (7), the
owners of Winooka ; J. T. Hackett (21),
Edgar Forsyth (25), Sid Baker (27), J.
A. Roles (28) and Harry Marsden (33).
Hackett is the younger bookmaker of
that name—dad was away confiding to
a reporter that “if Topical or Rogilla
had won the Metrop. our firm would
have had to find £30,000 for backers,
while other members of the ring would
have been hit to the extent of £30,000
G r £40,000.” This is considered dad’s
finest performance of the kind since
Speciality’s Metrop., when he told an-
other pressman that “Speciality was a
bad ho rse for us.” Baker is a man of
few words . but he has been heard to
declare that n.S.W.’s greatest statesman
was the late Chief Sec. Oakes. Forsyth
Was one of the boo kmakers who opened
the En?pir e Theatre and put on “Sunny.”
An evil-minded punter spread a report
that Edgar had been to “Sunny” 27
times, giving as his reason that a man
bad to get something for his money.

Ned Moss (10), one of the very
few Australians who have made punting
pay, and veterans James Barnes (24) and
J. A. Mayo (26).


THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
SCIENCE AND AGRICULTURE.
‘'The Chiel”: How many I'armers
realise what an essential part science
plays in the solution of their pro-
blems, particularly the problem of
maximum production? Take soil fer-
tility. Agricultural science offers no
more interesting or profitable study to
the man on the land. The fertility of
a soil is measured by its capacity to pro-
duce an abundant growth of crops to
which it and the climate of a locality
are adapted. Fertility is not dependent
on a single factor ; it requires the co-
ordination of many factors. It is de-
pendent, first, upon a sufficient supply
of the necessary plant-food elements;
second, upon an adequate water supply
to convey these elements in solution to
the roots ; third, upon sufficient warmth
to promote plant growth ; fourth, upon
sufficient air to meet the needs of the
roots for oxygen.
Fertile soil will generally consist of
the necessary soil minerals reduced to
a fine state of subdivision, incorporated
with more or less organic matter and
containing a sufficient supply of air,
water and soil bacteria. A study of soil
fertility thus entails a knowledge of the
chemical, physical and biological condi-
tions of the particular soil and a know-
ledge of how plants feed.
Before the development of the science
of chemistry it was impossible to form
an idea of how a plant came to grow.
The true theory of the nutrition of the
plant begins very soon after the dis-
covery of the composition of the air. The
subject is wide, and an amount of study
and research is necessary in order to
fully understand its ramifications.
The elements necessary to provide
complete sustenance to plants, and
through plants to animals, include phos-
phorus (phosphate), nitrogen, potassium
(potash), calcium (lime), iron, mag-
nesium, sodium, aluminium, silicon, boron,
chlorine, iodine, etc. Each is necessary
to maintain health and vigor in plants
and animals. Most soils contain abun-
dant supplies of most of them to meet
the requirements of ordinary crops. The
exceptions are phosphate, potash and
nitrogen. The principle of correct fertil-
ising is the supply of at least one of these
main plant foods in quantities that will
produce results. If lime is deficient in
the soil its use is essential to good pro-
duction ; it is not a fertiliser but a
medium through which all true fertilisers
do their best work. It is important that
the student of agricultural chemistry
should learn of the part played by the
elements named.
In recent times ideas of crop produc-
tion have been widened by investigations
in the sciences of botany, bacteriology,
geology and physics in their relation to
agriculture. The ancients knew that fer-
tilisers, if applied to the soil, produced
better crops, but they did not know why.
At present there are many beliefs and
practices current among farmers which
science has neither verified nor disproved,
and which may be either examples of
sound observation or only imperfect
generalisations. These opinions require
careful examination. Even when correct
they are of no final use to agriculture
until they have been explained and
absorbed into the general stream of
scientific knowledge.
Science must be the handmaiden of
agriculture just as it is of all other indus-
tries.
* * t- *
“Carben”: Water from the tap does
not benefit land as rain does. Each rain-
drop is a mass of electrical energy which
stimulates the plants. W. Pick, B.Sc.,
F.R.A.S., of England, says that rain-
drops are caused by the constant splitting
up of water, and that no drop greater
than one-fifth of an inch can reach the
ground. In this splitting up the drops
gain a positive charge of electricity and
the air in their neighborhood a negative
charge.
SEE THE WOOL SOLD.
“Jumbuck”: A woolgrower’s educa-
tion is not complete until he has attended
a sale ; a visit to the show floor should
satisfy him that there are better wools
than his. His presence at a sale might
show him the stupidity of his putting
hard and fast reserves on the clip. There
are times when certain lots are passed
in through not bringing what the broker’s
valuers consider a market price. It is
then that the presence of the owner
might make a difference, more especially
in a falling market. In seeing other
wools, the grower gains experience. He
meets other growers and hears their
views. If it does cost him the price of
a bale or two he will be repaid.
BACK TO THE BLADES.
“Wayback”: It is surprising that the
lean times in the pastoral industry have
not produced a movement to discard
the shearing machine for the blades.
The machine has many disadvantages.
It is costly to buy and requires
additional labor. It chops up the
wool and cuts the sheep. Its worst
feature is the way it shaves the
sheep, leaving the animal no protection
against a cold snap. Thousands of sheep
have died of cold after being machine-
shorn. Had they been blade-shorn the
wool left on, said to be equal to a
month’s growth, would have saved them.
The great argument in favor of machines
is “You get so much more wool.” But
you don’t. It is only borrowed from
the next year’s clip.
AGE-MARKING OF SHEEP.
“Tumbe”: “Sheepo’s” age-mark sys-
tem (B. 20/9/’33) has two faults. His
first year, when the ear is left full, does
not make any provision for drafting the
ewes from the wethers, and his fourth-
year sheep, with three front notches,
would be most difficult to distinguish in
the drafting-race, as a sheep with more
than a quarter wool growth would be
bound to have one of the notches hidden.
My system, a six-year one, is: First year,
one front notch ; second year, two front
notches; third year, one back and one front
notch; fourth year, one back notch;
fifth year, two back notches; sixth year,
one notch in tip of ear, ewes on off ear,
wethers on near ear. There is no need
to have separate marks for early and late
lambs if they are to be kept a term of
years. If they are to be sold as lambs
or weaners any experienced man can tell
their age to a month or two without an
earmark.
HAND-FEEDING.
“Wandi”: Heavy losses are often the
result of careless methods of hand-feed-
ing when sheep are poor and weak.
Divide sheep mobs of 1000 to 1500 into
different paddocks ; feed them at the same
place and time every day. They will soon
muster themselves without any crushing.
Keep the feeding-ground clear, level and
close to water and shade. Drive the feed
cart through it, throwing the feed out as
far as possible on both sides, so that the
sheep will spread. The wide spread en-
ables the lambs to keep with their
mothers. When the feed is forked or
shovelled out behind the cart, they drop
back from the scramble and cluster at the
tail. If they are not in good nick, they
will gather in little groups under bushes.
MARKING LAMBS.
“Lion”: Apart from the sterilisation of
instruments before marking, there is one
most important point to remember dur-
ing the operation: Don’t cut their tails
off too short.
Very short-tailed lambs suffer from in-
sidious fly attacks all their lives, because
their natural protection against them has
been removed. Where a lamb has two
inches of tail left, he can wag it vigor-
ously as soon as he feels a fly there, and
the fly will not lay its eggs. Take par-
ticular notice of your struck sheep this
summer with this in mind, and you will
observe how seldom long-tailed poddies
get struck there.
WINTER FEED.
“Hatter”: Plans for next winter’s feed-
ing should now be complete. Too many
cows are turned out on a bush run with-
out sufficient feed or mineral licks. Next
season’s milk yield will depend largely on
how the cows are wintered. Kale, maize,
millet, oats, Italian rye and red and crim-
son clover are all suitable crops, as well
as mangels and turnips. Do not rely
on one crop only. Fallow the land now.
Peas, clover or*a fed-off crop should
follow potatoes or wheat to restore fer-
tility to the soil and to keep pests and
diseases in check. Footrot in peas and
blight in wheat will be far less harmful
if a proper rotation is observed and a
wide interval allowed ; five years is re-
commended between the pea crop.
Diseases can be starved out of the soil.
Without winter cropping the carrying
capacity of a farm is reduced and both
profits and soil fertility suffer, while the
man who has it can buy on a glutted
market and sell on a firm one. Where
beans and barley or beans and white oats
are used for a forage crop the beans
should be sown three weeks before the
cereals.
“GREASY-HEEL” TREATMENT.
“Agri”: Draught-horses with “greasy
heel” or “itchy hock,” if not attended, do
much damage to fences (B. 13/9/’33).
They back up against the fence, and then
push, kick and stamp against the wires.
The lower wires break ; wire-netting is
ripped off and trampled flat, a bad thing
where there are rabbits.
Wash with washing soda and water,
and afterwards swab on creolin and water
from foot to hock.
Two recommended home cures are:
(1) Swab with used sump oil from a
tractor, the kerosene content of which
does good work. (2) Wash thoroughly
with fluid sheep-dip, about ! to 30.
SINKING A WELL.
“Bill R.”: Before sinking a well, pre-
pare for the timbering. The handiest
well size is 4ft. square. Cut the slabs
squarely 4in. longer, and adze them to
be evenly 2in. thick and in sets of equal
width. Two inches from their ends, halve
them on alternately opposite sides to fit
under and over behind the adjacent
slabs. Then begin the sinking, and use
a plumb-bob to keep it perpendicular.
When down 6f1., firm and level around
the top, place two or three tiers of 7ft.
square logs. Have them halved 18in.
from their ends into each other to make
self-locking joints at each corner. On
the upper tier rig the windlass. As the
dirt comes up pack it behind the logs
to form a well-cover watershed.
In sound country timber up at Bft. or
10ft., but make the sections shorter in
loose earth or sand. Dress the walls
before setting the timbers, and use a
spirit-level to keep them horizontal.
BUSHFIRE PREPARATIONS.
“Lion”: Good rains now mean plenty
of summer grass and added fife dangers,
so be prepared. Some points worth re-
membering :
(1) Eat down your woolshed paddock by
heavy stocking, and keep it short; also around
all other buildings if possible.
(2) Overhaul your motor fire-fighter now and
get all equipment in working order. Be sure
the hoses haven’t perished, and that the pump
functions efficiently.
(3) If any of your paddocks has spots where
lightning always strikes, eat out bare for the
summer, if possible, and minimise fire risks
from a dry thunderstorm.
(4) Don’t put up haystacks damp or green,
especially oats or lucerne hay with half-
dead barley-grass in. Both these fire extremely
quickly, getting internal heat rapidly.
(5) Prevent late burning-off of anything solid,
such as stumps with thick roots.
(6) Plough large fire-breaks early and deeply
if near a railway, and keep cultivated. This
doesn’t cost much, but might save your all.
(7) Top-dressing a chain around the boun-
dary fence with lcwt. super, causes the grass
to be sweeter, and stock eating it first, as they
do, give you a sound natural fire-break. This
is worth while, if you can possibly afford it.
(8) When the danger season starts, always
have all equipment ready for instant use.
(9) Make a special point of being better
organised in every wav than you were last year.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) How to sow Jerusalem artichokes, and
the quantity required per acre ? (2) Mode of
cultivation and attention, with approximate
return per acre ? (3) The best method of feed-
ing them to pigs and any indications of over-
feeding ? (4) Difference between hand-feeding
and allowing pigs to root the tubers themselves ?
—7962.
(1) and (2) The land should be deeply culti-
vated about May or June, lightly reploughed
about September, and the tubers dropped in
furrows about 3ft. apart, with a space of 2ft.
in between each tuber. If the tubers are large
they may be cut, but if small should be planted
whole. About 4cwt. of tubers will be required
to plant an acre. The harrow should be used
after rain until the plants are about 4in. high,
and later a cultivator between the rows. About
April or May, when the crop flowers and the
tops droop and die, the tubers are ready for
harvesting—an average yield is about five
tons per acre. (3) Allow the pigs to root and
harvest the tubers in the paddock; they will
not overeat. (4) There is no necessity for
hand-feeding. It is much too costly.
Method of taking the hair off kangaroo-skins
preparatory to tanning the hides for leather ? —■
8164.
Soak the hides in clean water for four
hours, then run off dirty water and cover with
clean; leave for 24 hours. (Dry hides should
be soaked for a further 24 hours, or until they
are soft.) Remove hair by soaking hides in
milk of lime —301 b. lime per 100 gallons water.
Handle each day, and leave until hair can be
removed. Time —six to seven days in summer.
Wash well with several lots of water after
removing the hair and pieces of flesh, fat, etc.
“Sour Milk”: In days when our milk
was sent by train, empty cans came back
with the lids tied on' but not jambed
down. Lorry transit cannot stand the
row of the jangling lids, so they are
packed on tight. .There are more cases
of bad and tainted milk since this scheme
operated. The air and sunlight helped to
cleanse and sweeten the container.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Dimon”: To improve whitewash for
sheds, add some milk and a iittle glue
to the mixture. This gives a gloss, and
the wash lasts for years.
“Willeroo”: If your horse is hard to
catch in a paddock, give him a bit of
damper or bread when you get him.
After a few tastes he will come up to
you.
“Tamornie”: To prevent fertiliser
caking on the stars of a seed drill, give
them many coats of good enamel
ahead of sowing time. It prevents cor-
rosive action, saves time and trouble
when using “dead” or sticky fertiliser,
and ensures its even distribution.
“Outback”: A few years ago I burnt
out a patch of scrub in which was an
old hickory-tree. Now I have dozens
of straight young trees that provide the
handles for farm tools. Hickory is a
quick grower, a great standby and
cheaper than bought handles.
“Hatter”: Do not take sheep and
lambs off bush country and keep them
continually on rich food, such as oats
or young grass. Turn them off daily
on to rough pasture, or give them grass
hay, chaff or even straw to keep their
digestive organs healthy.
“Heresone”: Old tanks cut in half —
an old axe and a straight eye will do it
—are hard to beat as roofs. I have used
them on pig shelters and fowlhouses. I
have seen a 30,000-gallon one on a
shearing shed. All have given satisfac-
tion. Have plenty of man power to lift
them into place.
“Prad”: A light application of wood-
preserving oil is good for the itch round
a horse’s hindquarters. If the prad
rubs his rear parts, paint him gently.
The oil quickly kills a minute microbe
which causes the itch. If the itch is
rubbed raw be careful, as the oil stings.
“Wrash”: A safe and speedy cure for
water gripes in horses is a beer-bottle
drench of warm water into which has
been stirred a half-bottle of aconite. For
dry gripes, mix with the same portion
of warm water a small bottle of sweet
nitre and a wineglassful of pain-killer.
Cut out the old inhuman remedy of
galloping the sick animal.
“Sucker”: Don’t use a spiked muzzle
for weaning a calf. Build a calf pad-
dock. I saw a record cow —a winner
at many shows —ruined by a nail-spiked
muzzled calf butting her udder to a gory-
mass. Good calves and cows are worth
proper treatment, and segregation is the
quickest and safest method.
“Chooky”: “A.C.B.’s” vermin-proof
roosts are all right, but, instead of hanging
each roost in its own loop of wire, sus-
pend a piece of 3in. x 2in. or length of
iron piping with two wires from the
rafters, just the width of the roosting
area. On these lay the perches, which
sit tight, and the whole gadget hangs on
four wires, simplifying cleaning, etc.
Have a light wire from the perches to
back and front walls to prevent swaying.
This scheme is adopted now by most
commercial farms.
“Minthall”: Add to the virtues of salt-
bush recently commented on, the fire-
break value. I’ve seen some of the big-
gest grass fires pulled up by a hedge of
saltbush. It checks a fire quicker than
any other growth. If graziers planted
hedges around their worst fire quarters
they would beat the red terror and have
a valuable drought fodder reserve. It
grows in a drought, lowers the lick and
salt needs, and produces wool and meat
of AI quality. Milk from cows fed on
its ration shows a wonderful cream test.
Grunters and fowls like it, too.
“A.C.8.”: Young cauliflower plants
are very tender and may be burnt
off by hot winds. When sowing
the seed, cover it lightly with well-
rotted horse manure ; if the weather is
very hot, provide some shade, such as
tea-tree bushes or sacking raised about
6in. above the plants. Just shade the
plants during hot hours. Give the seed-
bed a dressing of hydrated lime. If slugs
are troublesome place a piece of plain tin
around the outside of the seedbed, and
leave fresh meat bones about at night
covered with a grown cabbage leaf. Get
up early, collect the slugs and place them
in a heap. Then sprinkle them with salt
to kill them.

The Wheat Agreement
The Australian seasons, following their
usual incalculable habit, have put an-
other one over the politicians. The Com-
monwealth Government, deaf to the
pleading of many newspapers, agreed
to restriction of wheat-export quotas as
part of a world plan. Canberra Ministers
assured the country that it was merely
a formal matter —that statistical infor-
mation made it clear production would
come within the exportable allowance.
Now the crop promises to be 163,000,000
bushels, which means that in wheat and
flour we shall exceed our quota by
7,000,000 bushels, though next year we
shall have a much bigger margin—our
permissible crop will be 192,000,000
bushels for 1934-35.
* * * *
Nobody, however, would worry about
the small current surplus if it were not
for prices. The quota agreement was to
send wheat to 4s. It hasn’t. It has so
far sent it in N. S. Wales to 2s. 7jd. f.0.b.,
or under 2s. at country sidings. Moreover,
there seems to be no effective restriction
on exports in some Continental countries,
for Mid-Europe and Russia are delug-
ing Liverpool with supplies for which
they seem prepared to take any price,
from 21s. per quarter downwards. Lastly
there are no arrangements for a whsat
bonus in the Budget.
* * * *
As The Bulletin said last week, not
even a clairvoyant could estimate the
future position. Every overseas country
is bluffing. Stories are being given out
of immense stocks in the U.S.A. which
could be used “at the price of dirt” to
crush us in Oriental markets, but nobody
seems to know for certain whether they
exist or not. And even if they don’t, it
must be remembered that next year the
world’s export quota is to be allowed to
jump from 562,000,000 bushels to
746,000,000 bushels. Australia in two
years is to be permitted to export a
quantity equal to half of the year’s world
export —and she is comparatively small
potatoes in export. Canada, in two
years, will be allowed to ship a quan-
tity only 100,000,000 bushels short of
the 1933-34 world shipment.
* * * *
The only satisfaction about the posi-
tion is that we are no worse off than
we otherwise should have been. A free
market would not have sold the whole
of our indiscriminate and unorganised
crop; and the restriction might make
somebody wake up and give a little time
to selection of shipments if that can be
done at this late stage. It seems impos-
sible for Australian authorities to learn
lessons in these matters from patent
facts. As has been said over and over
again, 'wool-marketing needs no quotas
because we grow lines which the
world wants in marketable quantities
better than other countries. The wheat
market in Australia calls for quotas —
but not the kinds of quotas which restrict
its total output. What it does need is
a quota classing of shipments. Every
shipment should contain sufficient var-
ieties of wheat to meet full mill-blending
requirements.
* * * *
.Suitable wheat, suitable shipments,
skill in marketing and rigidly accurate
sampling are the essentials of a success-
ful and payable Australian wheat market.
The present stupid see-saw arrangement
under which old gentlemen and politi-
cians meet to tie Australian growers’
hands next season, when every week
proves that their statisticians are not
able to estimate the potentialities of the
current one a week or two ahead, may
mean ruin and despair for thousands of
wheatgrowers. Unfortunately, politi-
cians do not suffer for these miscalcula-
tions.
Wheat Pools
“Longo”: In asserting CB. 20/9/’33)
that “no wheat pool has yet secured any-
thing tangible in the way of increased
prices for its members,” “The Chiel” has
overlooked the Queensland pool. Since
its inauguration in 1920 the board which
administers the pool has been able to
pay to Queensland growers the highest
price in Australia for wheat delivered to
it, despite the huge surpluses in N.S.W.
Growers know when they are well off,
as the history of the Queensland pool
proves.
After the first pool of 1920-21,
growers were asked to state by ballot
whether they wished the pool to con-
tinue, and for how long. Eighty-eight
per cent, were in favor of continuance,
and 77 per cent, of these favored a three-
year period ; the pool was extended to
include the three seasons terminating
with 1924-25. A further ballot taken on
11/10/’24 resulted in a vote of 88.3 per
cent in favor of continuance, no less than
87.6 per cent, favoring the longest period
—three years. On 28/4/’2B a proclama-
tion was issued extending the pool for
five years—until 30/11/’33. This was
subject to a proviso that a requisition
signed by 500 or more growers would
have entailed a ballot, but the requisi-
tion was not forthcoming.
“By selling privately he gets his cash
on delivery,” says “The Chiel.” Quite so
—but only the cash permitted by a mer-
chant-controlled market which is de-
pressed out of all proportion by even the
smallest of temporary surpluses. If “The
Chiel” lived in Queensland he would know
of the benefits derived from the wheat
pool and the butter board’s operations.
Sydney Wool Market
“Anthony”: Consider these figures:
Week’s Sydney auction sales
(three days only), bales 34,662
Week’s private sales, bales 2,806
Total week’s sales, bales 37,468
Average per pound, pence 12.75
Average per bale £l6/3/2
A solid lump of wool to be sold in
three days, and a solid price to sell it at.
The woolgrower cannot growl about his
lot on such showings, and he need feel
no concern that the average price has
crept back from the high level it reached
a month ago. As stated in B. 27/9/33,
the quality of the wool forward for sale
has a good deal to do with the lower
range of values, and, with good competi-
tion from all quarters for wools suited
to the several peculiar requirements of
the different countries, the market closed
with a more buoyant tone than the week
preceding.
* * * *
Over 266,000 bales of wool have been
sold in the Sydney market alone this
season, and at an average price slightly
above to-day’s—a price 50 p.c. to 60 p.c.
above the general run of the average in
the first half of this year. Large volumes
of wool have also been on offer in the
other selling centres, and the parity of
price just about equal to our own. But
the position is too good to risk by strain-
ing too far. The unofficial supplies
brought up for private sale by those who
have bought wool in the shed constitute
an extra burden on buying requirements,
and the lower price at which it has to be
offered to effect sales has a white-anting
process on the general health of the
situation.
* * * *
The trade is lucky, since the overseas
speculating element, which rushed to
secure supplies of wool as a better com-
modity to hold than currency, now seems
to have been satisfied, and demand is
now almost entirely on account of legi-
timate consuming interests. Currencies,
of course, can easily show a bigger depre-
ciation than has been evident in the wool
market, and the fact that international
operators, who are ampng the shrewdest
and best-informed men in the world,
showed faith in the strength of the wool
position during a very doubtful time is
some guarantee for trust in the future.
But it should also be noted that the same
men dropped out of the market when the
staple climbed to the price it reached a
month ago.
s|c Jfc Jfc
Reports from the manufacturing
centres of the whole world become more
satisfying. Business in fabrics, yarns and
tops is good, and it has that pleasing
international flavor which was such a
healthy feature of the splendid trading
conditions in the decade immediately be-
fore the Great War broke out.
Country Selling
“Lion”: It is time those who sell in the
shed realised that in nearly every case
they could have done better in Sydney.
Here are a few reasons why:
(1) Instead of dealing with one shrewd coun-
try buyer, there is keen competition on the
open market and therefore a better price gener-
ally.
(2) We are told wool costs ljd. per pound to
sell in Sydney. Our figures over eight years
show fd. per pound as nearer the mark. Here
is fd. per pound of your money given away to
the country buyer.
(3) Country buyers hope to make a profit at
your expense.
(4) The Sydney brokers charge 1J p.c. com-
mission, the country agent 2| p.c.
(5) The selling trade and the stability of the
wool market are upset by selling in the shed.
(6) If the wool market is disorganised, remem-
ber what you made on your clip you will
lose on your surplus-sheep sales.
(7) Country sellers, when hard hit, no doubt
apply to their brokers for help and get it.
Why not stick to them?
The Bulletin (27/9/’33) gave its
readers a good idea of the wool position,
which shows a general shortage. This
is hardly likely to harm the present value
of wool as long as the market isn’t upset
by stupid shed-selling.
Grow Better Wool
“Tripex”: “Jumbuck” hit a good nail
squarely on the head (B. 4/10/’33) when
he said that the present improvement
in the wool outlook should be used to
improve the wool itself. I would like to
do my bit in driving the nail home.
Some years ago, when the robust char-
acter of our Australian merino wool be-
came a bit overdeveloped in response to
commercial expediency, it was frequently
said that the clip N was deteriorating,
whereas it had simply been taken to an
undue pitch of strength in the effort to fill
the bales, the quality of the wool for a
few years being overlooked in the deter-
mination to get length and bulk. To-day,
however, the quality of much of our wool
has definitely slipped back, and that on
account of sheer neglect. Much of it is
not showing the gross development of a
few years since (a big enough mistake,
but capable of easy correction); it is
showing a coarse, straight, “run-out,”
characterless tendency which is the result
either of underbreeding or of inbreeding.
In other words, growers have been sacri-
ficing the quality of their flocks for the
sake of economy ; they have not been
culling deeply enough or not getting good
enough blood in their rams —or both.
Hard times and mounting overdrafts
have forced many men into pinching, but
it is false economy to undermine one’s
main source of income.
A Market for Pigs
“N.K.” : Australia still lags behind in
the export of pigs, although present prices
for pork and bacon are higher in pro-
portion than for any other primary com-
modity. In the past six months M.L.
exported to Britain 117,507, or 69 per
cent, increase on the previous year.
Australia sent 37,059 —only an increase
of 31 per cent, for the corresponding
period.
There is a practically unlimited de-
mand for porkers of suitable type on
the English market between October and
January. Porkers of 601 b. to 901 b. dressed
weight at sd. per lb. compare more than
favorably with any other primary pro-
duct. If we don’t supply the demand,
somebody else will. M.L. is well ahead
of Australia, though why the M.L.
farmer can produce butter and bacon at
cheaper rates than the Australian farmer
needs some explanation. The Australian
pig is of no particular type. All breeds
are represented. The favorite with
N.S.W. and Queensland breeders seems
to be the Tamworth-Berkshire cross,
which has proved satisfactory in that it
gives a good-shape carcass for either pork
or bacon and stands climatic changes
better than the softer white breeds.
In Queensland the Large White has
come into prominence, and the Forgan
Smiths intend to subsidise the sale of
boars of that breed. Advocates of Whites
claim that the English market needs a pig
with a white skin and will have no other.
Farmers are sceptical, and have not dis-
played any great desire to change from
the well-tried breeds which have been
proved by experience. The fact remains
that the demand is there, and where
-there is a demand there will be a supply.
It is up to Australian farmers to study and
cater for the market. The urgent neces-
sity is for a good and regular supply of
the type of carcass required, not a multi-
plicity of pigs of various breeds, shapes,
sizes and conditions. Until this is done,
no stable market can be secured.
Margarine and Stabilisation
“8.Z.1.”: “M.T.C.” (B. 4/10/’33),
while stressing the advantages to be had
from the new butter-stabilisation scheme,
overlooks an important factor —the part
which margarine must play. By mar-
garine I am not referring to the mid-
Victorian preparation compounded from
beef dripping. To that no dairy-farmer
objects. In that, butter never had a
serious competitor. But when chemists
produced an article based on vegetable
oils which, with the addition of a little
milk or butter, was an imitation of the
original cow product, the dairy-farmer
faced a serious problem. The oil pro-
duct could be retailed at pence below the
sterling article, and was so close to it in
color, taste and appearance, especially
when wrapped in parchment paper and
packed like butter in pound and half-
pound “prints,” that even those who had
spent a lifetime in the butter trade were
sometimes deceived.
* # s *
This butter substitute was introduced
in Melbourne with a butter-fat content of
30 p.c. Its popularity in the industrial
suburbs grew rapidly, and before long
the butter trade found that it had dis-
placed about 15 p.c. of butter sales. The
trade in its turn got busy and, with the
aid of country interests in Parliament,
had a bill passed making the use of
butter-fat or milk in butter substitutes
illegal. That put on the stopper tem-
porarily, but N.S.W. presented an open-
ing. Here, according to the Pure Foods
Regulations, up to 10 p.c. of butter
could be incorporated in any margarine,
so the manufacture of these substitutes
was moved to Sydney. Business hummed ;
so did cow-cockydom when it awoke to
its new competitor. Farmers’ organisa-
tions stirred up the Agriculture Depart-
ment, which gazetted restrictive regula-
tions, which, however, were not worth
the paper they were printed on —a fact
which the manufacturers of the substi-
tute soon found out. With the aid of
further experiments in the laboratory,
they omitted all butter and turned out
an article just as good as the original
mixture, but at a greatly reduced cost.
The department, having failed to bluff
the manufacturers and the retailers—
though an army of inspectors was im-
ported to do the necessary harassing—
withdrew the regulations, much to the
satisfaction of the manufacturers of the
substitute. The result is seen in the
increased sales of the substitute and the
consequent displacement of butter.


NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Modern Explorers
From Commander H. T. Bennett:
Re aerial “explorers” (B. 27/9/’33), may I
say that my last expedition to Bathurst Island
was in no way that of exploration, nor was it
ever referred to as such by any member of the
party. Further, I myself acted as surveyor to
both the Donald Macxay expeditions, which you
praise, carrying out the duties of navigator of
aircraft as we 11.... Some of the regions “pot-
tered over at 120 miles an hour” on the
Bathurst Island trip had not been traversed by
man before. Much valuable data for correc-
tion of Admiralty charts was obtained, and is
being sent to the Admiralty There is no
question of vanity whatever in such work.
The Commonwealth Government has not
thanked Mr. Mackay for any of his work, nor
has it incorporated any of the data of the 1930
expedition on its latest maps.
The Admiralty, however, thanked him by
return post for his half-scale copy of his map,
stating that the new data would be incorporated
in its next edition. I have never called my-
self an explorer, nor have 1 ever named a single
new feature of land or sea after myself.
On which The Bulletin remarks that
it cannot find a single report on the
Bathurst Island flight in which the under-
taking is not referred to as an exploring
expedition. And if Commander Bennett
imagines that he has been over any
region on his route which has not been
covered in the past half-century by some
human beings he is an optimist. The
writer of The Bulletin article to which
Commander Bennett takes exception was
once taken through N.T. country which
an old hand, his guide, assured him had

scarcely been explored yet, and which
was reputed to be full of gold. There was
no gold—there was no wash even. The
deserted region of to-day had carried a
large population of white and yellow
miners 60 years ago and they had
pocketed it out to the last handful of
washdirt. Yet a man who did not know
the signs might have been deluded. The
idea that any flying party can add to the
pastoral knowledge of Australia outside
some central desert regions does not hold
water.

More Politicians
Only V. H. Tozer among this week’s
gallery of Queensland politicians is a
member of the Opposition. He comes
from Gympie. which produced Andrew
Fisher and his own father, who was
Home Secretary in days when every
statesman wore a beard.
G. C. Taylor and V. C. Gair are metro-
politan Labor members, newcomers who
so far have not risen above parts in
Forgan Smith’s beauty chorus which
makes the path of Opposition speakers
hard. Tom Foley is member for Nor-
manby, and he has supplied his own
biography by request —so modest a one
that it is worth printing in full:
Born 1886, Charters Towers.
Employment, mining, timber.
Hobby, wireless.
Studies, economics.
First elected, Leichhardt, Dec., 1919; elected
for reconstituted Normanby, May, 1931.
Lastly, there is George Barber, the Father
of the House. He lingers, a 70-year-old
relic of the days when Honest Dave
Bowman was Labor leader and a lot of
kind words were said even by the bluest-
blooded Tories in the House for the pala-
dins of democracy. He is a Suffolk-born
man who ran away from school because
he didn’t like grammar and joined the
Dogger Bank trawling fleet. Then he
fished for cod in Newfoundland waters,
gravitated to Australia in 1889 and
became Labor member for Bundaberg,
which he still represents, in 1901. He was
secretary to the party for 25 years.
“Thargo”: The ghosts of the old-timers
must have rubbed their eyes over a
comedy which took place at The Springs,
60 miles from Aramac, the other day.
The local wool-removers, having finished
shearing, found the countryside so deep
in mud that even cars could not get over.
Instead of settling down to crown-and-
anchor and a little light poker, they tele-
phoned for an aeroplane, and were re-
moved to the next job in fast order.
* . * * *
“Kaloa”: It is beginning to look as if
the day of the white prospector is com-
ing to an end in New Guinea. The
native is beginning to develop a com-
mercial sense, and as soon as the sort of
thing that is going on in the Milne Bay
district spreads nothing will keep the
field for the white gouger. The headman
of Milne Bay and his subjects at pre-
sent are turning 200 ounces of metal into
the bank every week, and the place
bristles with alarm clocks, footballs,
tumbac, rhinestones, turkey-red and all
the other treasures dear to the native
heart. So far nobody can find out where
their gold is coming from.
* * * *
“Hopalong”: Is the public-service
clerk so much better off than the clerk
in private business? Take the Queens-
land State variety. After 11-years’ ser-
vice his salary rises by £lO and £l5 in-
creases to £3OO p.a. This has been cut
to £255, out of which he has to contri-
bute £l2 p.a. to a superannuation fund
w'hich is not supported by the Govern-
ment. This fund provides for an annu-
ity of £lOO at 65 and £5O incapacity
allowance and £2OO at death. The out-
side clerk is entitled at 65 to old-age
pensions of £94 10s. p.a. for himself and
his wife, and can meanwhile spend the
whole of his salary as he likes,

“St. L.”: The North has more than its
fair share of disease this season, though
nobody much seems to die of it. Mainly
h as run to i n fl ue nza—the only scourge
productive of mortality—measles, chicken
pox and mumps in outside doses,
xhrough the months of July, August and
September many schools found them-
se j ves w £th only 50 per cent, of pupils
on their hands. Murgon Rural School
at one per j od fi a( j classes of 250 reduced
t 0 m and in others the youngsters have
bad tbe g r j m sa ti s f ac tion of seeing so
man y teachers laid low that discipline
has had tQ be relaxed . Much of the
trouble might be obviated if there were
better-developed plan of quarantine,
Qf lhe inst £ nt s osing of H a schooi
would be cheaper in the end than the
n
existing systems.
* * * *
Calliungal . When Peaice is fixing
up his defence schemes he should not
forget that one of the greatest needs of
the North is aerodromes. The richest
parts of the coastal districts of Queens-
land are almost without them. There
are a few spots where a large, open, un-
lighted space serves the purpose in dry
weather; but after a little rain—and we
do have a little rain sometimes—they
become impossible. H. L. Fraser, of
Rockhampton Aerial Services, who did
an 1800-mile flight of investigation last
week, found no ground north of Towns-
ville fit to land and take off on in bad
weather. A lot of the cement which
Sydney and Brisbane put into footpaths
and road speedways should be going into
northern runways. There can’t be too
many landing-grounds up this way, and
every one of them should be properly
lighted with the help of the Defence
Department.
* * * *
“J.”: Considering the difficulties of
aviation in Australia, solid progress has
been made by Qantas. Outside the sub-
sidised mail routes no help is received,
yet it is subject to taxation to a greater
extent than any other form of transport
or any other industry. Air transport
depends on A 1 fuel. The Common-
wealth tax of 74d. per gal. on benzine
amounts to 28 p.c. of total fuel costs. In
the Qantas annual report Fergus Mc-
Master states that taxation has virtually
a half-share in all profits, accepting no
risks and giving no assistance to rebuild
lost capital. Yet Qantas has retained its
volume of route passengers. Freight is
offering in excess of machine capacity,
which says much for the enterprise of
a young company.
* * * *
“Vic”: North Queensland, helped by
an active propagandist, A. W. Fadden, is
taking a lot of interest in power alcohol,
of which the Forgan Smith Government
has decreed there must henceforward be
6 p.c. in all petrol used in Q’land. Fad-
den has printed a booklet in which he
proposes the production of 240,000,000
gallons of alcohol from 800,000 acres
planted with maize, sugarcane and cas-
sava. He says that his scheme should
increase Australian spending power by
£25,000,000 per annum. There is noth-
ing fantastic in his ideas. Germany,
which has less land available for such an
enterprise and a winter to consider which
precludes the cultivation of some of the
plants which give the biggest alcohol con-
tent, turns out 80,000,000 gallons per
annum. Many German brands of petrol
contain 25 p.c. power alcohol, and
France, Italy and Czecho-Slovakia all
have fixed statutory proportions of p.a.
which must be added to mineral gasoline
by irfiporters. Fadden declares that the
cost of production should not more
than 9d. per gallon and that if the
200,000 tons of sugar now exported at a
loss was used for alcohol production its
yield would be 36| million gallons. The
only possible fly in the ointment is
whether the new diluted brand of juice
would suit Australian motorists. If some
of the so-called “benzine sold in French
and German provincial towns were
offered m Austria there would be a lot
of dead garage proprietors about.
Galr.’ Gossip from Brisbane
For Tattersall’s postponed meeting we
had our first touch of summer. Judg-
ing by the frocking, the womenfolk had
been longing for such a day, because all
sorts of new and pretty clothes had their
first airing. The favorite organdie was
seen everywhere—on heads, on hands,
on frocks and on coats. But why ruin
the bodice of an attractive frock by
concealing it with a gigantic organdie
bow? Among those present were the
Cadell Garricks, who brought their son
Hunter, of Townsville. Mrs. Whitting-
ham was all in black, except for the white
organdie bow on the shoulder. Mrs. E. T.
Bell, in a black-and-white smart swagger
suit, brought daughter Patsy in maroon
silk with brown crocheted turban.
If you have any pennies to spare, you
are asked to hand them over to the
Creche and Kindergarten, which never
before have been faced with such finan-
cial difficulties. All sorts of touching
messages have been broadcast. Evidently
such a message reached the staff of W. D.
and H. O. Wills. Through good organisa-
tion their effort brought £4O. They ran
a bridge party on the top floor of their
handsome new building in Ann-street.
Jean White and Trevor Lahey were
wedded at St. Paul’s Church of England,
Stanthorpe, the district where the bride’s
parents, the C. F. Whites, are among the
best-known. The bridegroom is the only
son of Mrs. Isaiah Lahey, of Brisbane.
The only touch of white the bride
showed was the bow perched on the
left shoulder of her cool-looking green
crinkle crepe frock. Peter Blundell sup-
ported the chief man. Toasts were given
at the White homestead.
Canon Garland is thoroughly disgusted
with parents who do not insist that their
boys should go on the land. He was
speaking at the annual meeting of the
New Settlers’ League, and announced
that 200 jobs on farms were waiting to
be filled.
There was a big roll-up for the “Use
More Wool” Exhibition at the City Hall,
opened by Agriculture Minister Bulcock.
The president of the committee. Lady
Mayoress Greene, wore a smart fawn
turnout, with the jauntiest brown fur felt
cap to show off her black tresses.
Arthur Moore was rewarded for his little
speech with a woollen tie.
Madge Macdonald, who will leave us
soon to join Lady Clark in Hobart, has
been attending a round of parties. One
of the jolliest was given by Nora Halford
in her Craigston flat. The next day, Mrs.
Macdonald invited guests to a cocktail
party, where Madge was wished the best
of luck.
Education Minister Cooper thinks
high-school boys, as well as girls, should
be taught cooking. He says Brisbane
lads should become the chefs at our first-
class hotels, instead of foreigners. The
Minister also advocates lessons in dress-
designing for the male,
Under Barbara Sisley’s expert tuition,
some of the Lyceum Club members were

pressed with the many lovely gardens she
saw everywhere. One of her happiest

Information Sought.
As an Englishman who has resided six
years in Australia I desire to ask: (I) Are Oswald
Pryor’s Cornish-Australian characters authentic,
and is their dialogue true to nature ? (2) Where
do such people exist in Australia? (3) Why do
the characters depicted by some of your artists
employ such appellations as “sir" and "madam"
when they know quite well (if they know their
Australia) that such courtesies are anathema in
this country? —Blss.
(1) They are authentic, and their idiom is
faithfully transcribed. You will find authori-
tative confirmation of the fidelity of Pryor’s
dialogue in such works as Hamilton Jenkins’s
“History of Cornwall and Its Mines.” (2) At
Moonta and Wallaroo in South Australia, and
in other parts of the Commonwealth where
Cornishmen became settlers. (3) Impressions of
social usages depend on the company you
keep. The elementary rules of courtesy are not
a dead letter in any stratum of Australian
society.
(1) Mathematicians cannot solve an equation
without at least one constant. Are there any
constants in nature ? (2) If there are not, what
becomes of all the laws of physics that are
mathematically expressed ? (3) What is the
scientific idea of a standard of measurement ?
8251.
(1) Doubtful. Speed of light and the terres-
trial gravitational constant used to be considered
immutable. It was always admitted, however,
that these were not absolutely determined.
Einstein has arrived at conclusions on grounds
accepted as valid by many mathematicians and
physicists, and verified by astronomers, which
make even these standards of measurement con-
ditional. (2) The truth of a mathematical ex-
pression of a physical law is not affected by
standards of measurement. For all practical
purposes, and for almost all scientific purposes,
the accepted mathematical formulas of physics
may be implicitly relied upon. (3) That’s a
question exponents of the various branches of
science will answer each in his own way. It
is mostly (here we get back to Einstein) a
matter of “relativity.” At the same temperature
equal masses of two pure elements have a fixed
ratio of weight; there is a fixed ratio of their
degree of _ expansion or contraction between the
same variations of temperature; between the
stage at which conditions of temperature or
pressure cause them to change their form from
solid to liquid; from liquid to gas. The con-
stant from which such things as that are
measured is an arbitrary standard, such as the
rectangular bar of bronze kept in London,
which has embedded in ifc two gold plugs, the
centres of which, at 62deg. Fahr., are a dis-
tance apart that is defined as one yard.
Method of tempering motor-car springs in
an ordinary blacksmith’s forge ? —7841.
Use a piece of pipe, wrought iron or cast
iron, of large enough diameter to enclose the
longest leaf of the spring. Cover the pipe with
small coal or coke. Place each leaf in this ex-
temporised furnace and heat to a cherry-red,
then quench in a vessel containing oil—fish oil
is best. Take the spring out and drain it off,
place it again in the fire and heat slowly until
the coating of oil has been consumed, then
quench again in the oil, quickly.
There is'mention in a popular ballad, “Moire,
My Girl,” of “Desmond’s Earl.” Who was
he P —B2BB.
. One of the original Earls of Desmond has
a niche in Irish history as author of the Head
Act, passed by him when deputy-ruler of
Ireland in 1465. The statute authorised the
beheading, without trial, of thieves and sus-
pected thieves who had not in their company
“any faithful man of good name and fame in
English apparel.” This earldom lapsed, and
was revived in 1622 in favor of Sir William
Feilding, an English supporter of the Stuart
cause. Though the title is Irish the family has
no Irish estate.

Brief description of vitamin E and a list of
the foods containing the largest proportions of
this vitamin ? —8213.
The vitamins have been reorganised recently
and many that belonged to the old vitamin E
classification are now included in the vitamin
B complex. This vitamin is found in yeast,
fresh cereals, vegetables, peanuts, etc. The
complete list covers many pages. Get a copy
of the new book on vitamins issued by the
Medical Research Council.
Do the natives of the British Solomon Islands
speak one dialect, and is “pidgin” English
widely used there ? —B2BO.
Over 40 native dialects are spoken. In many
parts of the Protectorate “pidgin” English is
spoken and understood by the natives, especi-
ally in the eastern parts of the group.
(1) How many persons were killed when
blacks attacked the Fraser family at Hornet
Bank station ? (2) What was the date ? (3)
Is it a fact that a surviving Fraser was given a
permit to shoot blacks ? —8287.
(1) Eleven —Mrs. Fraser, four daughters,
three sons, a tutor and two shepherds. (2)
October 27, 1857. (3) Can’t say. There is no
mention of it in contemporary newspaper
accounts nor in Knight’s “In the Early Days,”
which recounts the circumstances of the mass-
acre. Two of the Fraser sons survived —the
eldest, who was absent from home at the time,
and Sylvester, aged 15, who recovered from
injuries.
(1) To what height above normal did the
1893 flood in Brisbane rise? (2) How long did
the flood last ? (3) What was the name of the
vessel that steamed up the main street in flood
time ? —8175.
(1) 28ft. 9in. above mean spring tide. (2)
From February 3 to 10. (3) No vessel steamed
up the main street, but the gunboat Paluma
and the steamer Elamang were washed into
Bunya Walk in the Botanic Gardens and left
there. The steamer Konoowarra broke from
ner mornings and drifted into the grounds of
a house at New Farm.
What evidence is available concerning the
influence of the use of machinery upon employ-
ment ? —8248.
Can’t traverse the whole field, but U.S.A.
statistics should be a valuable guide. Between
1900 and 1925 population increased by 54.1
p.c.; the productivity per head of persons
engaged in manufactures increased by 49 p.c.;
the amount of power used in manufacturing
industries increased by 256.1 p.c. and the
number of persons engaged in such industries
increased by 86.9 p.c. A comparable increase
was maintained up till the middle of 1929,
after which nation-wide statistics are not avail-
able.
Is epilepsy curable ? Is it a brain disease ?
Is it one of the oldest diseases known ? Is it
very common ? Are there hospitals for its
treatment ? Would it debar a person from
travelling if with a companion ? —8246.
It is a condition which varies with the indi-
vidual. Some cases respond very well to
treatment, whilst others appear more resistant.
It is a momentary disturbance of the brain
which causes the fit. Epilepsy is an old disease,
and Julius Caesar is supposed to have had it
(“the falling sickness”). It is fairly common.
Hospitals that specialise in brain troubles deal
with it. There is no special epilepsy hos-
pital in Australia. It is desirable that the
patient should have a companion with him all
the time
Is there a cure for urticaria ? —8240.
No specific cure. The trouble is caused by
the patient being susceptible to some particular
protein. This can be found in certain foods,
certain plants or certain clothes. What affects
one person has absolutely no influence on
another. Things as different as pollen, eggs,
fur and strawberries may cause the trouble.
It is a long and painstaking job finding out
which protein is at the root of the disease, but
many cases are successfully treated.
What is delirium, what causes it and what
are its different types ? —8338.
It is a temporary derangement of the mental
processes, similar to the condition of insanity,
but usually associated with some form of bodily
disease. It may accompany any feverish con-
dition, and varies in intensity according to the
extent and degree of the fever; inflammatory
disease is particularly liable to cause delirium.
A toxic condition of the blood induced by the
absorption of drugs such as opium, chloroform
and alcohol is apt to cause mental aberration
Exhaustion, whether due to the effect of wasting
disease, prolonged bodily exertion or nervous
strain, is also a possible cause. The types of
mental perversion are illusions, hallucinations
and delusions.
/ intend building a circular concrete fish
pond and understand that, owing to the chemi-
cal action of the concrete, fish will not imme-
diately live in the water. (1) How should the
pond be prepared for the fish ? (2) Suitable
depth ? (3) Most suitable covering for the
bottom of the pond —sand or earth ? (4) How
can I cultivate water-lilies in it? —8151.
(1) Fill with water and dissolve powdered
alum in the proportion of about lib. to 25
gallons. Allow to stand for about a week, then
wash out with two or three changes of water.
(2) 18in. to 2ft. (3) River sand, not beach
sand. (4) These should be planted in wooden
cases, such as butter-boxes, containing a rich
garden loam in which well-rotted cow manure
is incorporated in the proportion of 1 part of
manure to about 5 parts of soil. Scoop out a
little of the soil and plant the water-lilies hori-
zontally, with the growing edge, or crown, just
at the surface. Then cover the soil with about
an inch of sand to prevent the soil mixture
from clouding the water. Plant in July or
August.
Particulars concerning one-act play competi-
tion being conducted by the Dramatists’ Club,
Melbourne 3—8279.
The club is inviting the submission of one-
act plays written by Australians, for the best of
which a £5 ss. prize will be given. The entrance
fee is 2s. 6d. per play and there is no restric-
tion as to number, nor is previous production a
bar to acceptance. Closing date of entries is

Did Captain Cook in passing north to Botany
Bay {N.S.W.) make a call for water at Watta-
molla, National Park? —8186.
He did not land at Wattamolla. He
attempted a landing at a place north of Bulli
but did not succeed on account of the heavy
surf.
My geraniums are afflicted by a blight,
active during summer, which spreads rapidly.
Cause and cure ? —8195.
Cut off and burn all affected leaves; then
spray the plants and leaves, getting well under-
neath them) with a mixture of ioz. potassium
sulphate and 2 gallons of water. Lime-sulphur
(trade strength) is also a deterrent and should
be well emulsified with soap before applying.
Choose a warm morning for the work and do
not water for at least a week. The trouble is
rust.
(1) Is royal blue the correct shade of blue of
the old willow pattern china ? (2) What are
the colors of the Australian flannel-flower and
the waratah ? —Bl7B.
(1) A rather deep royal blue is considered
to be the correct color, but great quantities of
willow pattern have been turned out of English
potteries in every shade of blue, a light brown
and mixed realistic shades. In needlework, two
blues are used for willow,’ a deep royal and a
sky shade. (2) Flannel-flowers are usually
described as white, but in some seasons and
some localities they are greyish, or faintly
grey-greenish. The massed florets which make
up the waratah head of flowers are deep
crimson on well-grown plants; slightly lighter
in shade on plants grown in poor areas.
In place of the original 30 in. by s \in. tyres
1 have fitted 32/n. by 6in. on my car. (1) What
difference will the speedometer show in (a) dis-
tance, (b) speed ? (2) Is the speed variation
due to the larger tyres constant ? —Bl3l.
(1) (a) Speedometer will register approxi-
mately 1-16th mile short in every mile. If a
16-mile run is recorded, that means 17 miles.
( b ) Speed will be under-recorded by l-16th.
When speedometer reads 48, real speed is 51
m.p.h. (2) Yes.
Recipe for fruit-saline powder? —BlBo.
Assemble |lb. icing sugar, 4 packets Epsom
salt, |oz. magnesia, 2oz. baking soda, 2oz.
tartaric acid, 4oz. cream of tartar. Place the
salts on a tray in the oven with the door
slightly open and a moderate heat until they
become hard and brittle. Then pound all in-
gredients together in a large basin and mix
thoroughly. Store in a tightly-screwed jar in a
dry place. Use 1 to 2 teaspoons in a glass of
water.
Where was Colchis in ancient geography, and
what was it famed for? —8317.
It was a country in Asia, situated between
the Caucasus on the north, Iberia on the east,
Armenia on the south, Pontus on the south-
west and the Euxine on the west. It was
noted in Greek mythology as the home of all
sorcery, the land of Medea and the Golden
Fleece. Its inhabitants were from earliest times
engaged in linen manufacture. The modern
province of Mingrelia and a part of Abasia
correspond with the ancient Colchis.
Exactly what is a contralto ? What musicians
first utilised this style of singing ? —8328.
An Italian term to denote the lowest or
deepest kind of female voice, the compass ex-
tending from F or G below the middle C to
F or G above the treble stave. Early French and
German composers did not utilise this voice,
but Rossini and other Italians, recognising its
beauties, adopted it, and it is now used by
almost all nations in their choral music.
(1) Who were the North American loyalists
who proposed to colonise N.S.W., and (2) what
was their scheme of colonisation ? —7863.
(1) They were a large body of men who
had opposed and fought the revolt of the
British colonists in North America led by Wash-
ington. They desired an “asylum where they
might repair their broken fortunes.” (2) The
plan, roughly, was for the formation of a
settlement in N.S.W. to be directed by some of
the “most intelligent and candid Americans.”
Apart from local cultivation, it was advanced
that there would be a profitable trade with
China and Japan, and, in case of war with
Holland or Spain, N.S.W. would be a base
from which ships might sail to attack Java,
invade Spanish America, or intercept the Manila
ships.
Was St. James’s Church in King-street, Syd-
ney, built or originally planned as a court-
house and the present Supreme Court as a
church ? —7963.
Macquarie planned to build a courthouse on
the present site of St. James’s, and in June, 1814,
a subscription list (headed by £5OO from the
Government) was opened for the work. Some
months later the foundation stone was laid. Then
Commissioner Bigge, representing the British
Government, who had given consent to the
proposal, changed his mind. He ordered the
plans to be altered to a church building, and
St. James’s was the result. The present court-
house was the site where Macquarie had plans
prepared for the erection of a school for the
education of poor children. Bigge later coun-
termanded this plan also, and ordered the con-
struction of the present courthouse.

married person domiciled in M.L. for two years
may apply for a divorce. One of the grounds,
which would, apparently, apply to Smith’s case,
is “that the petitioner and respondent are
parties to any decree, order or judgment made
in any country, if such decree, order or judg-
ment has in that country the effect that the
parties are not bound to live together,” the
thing having been in force three years. Whether
such a provision, alien to N.S.W. law,
would be recognised for divorce in that
State is a question for legal argument... . K.:

takes your fancy, write to the MANAGER,

Business, Robbery, Etc.
“Executive”: A unionist, and, I
hope, a good Australian, I had to find
some way out of the same problem as
“Sore Tongue” (B. 20/9/’33). 1 now mix
one part of Australian tobacco to four
parts of imported. The 20 per cent, is
quite satisfactory to me, and, I hope, to
the grower.
* * * *
“D.E.”: For a time after Britain went
back on gold, at Winston Churchill’s in-
stance, and Australia followed suit, my
Sydney bank gave me sovereigns for my
cheques. Why didn’t I collect those
Jimmy O’ Goblins and sock ’em away?
1 could have got £1 18s. sd. for every
one last week; that was the Wales’s
price.
* * * *
From “Sam Bowlegs”:
South Aus. is the only State that has any
really effective legislation dealing with coupons
(B. 27/9/’33). Its Trading Stamps Act, 1924,
makes it an offence to offer prizes, free gifts,
or anything of value in connection with the
sale of goods. The Queensland bill is an
attempt to tighten up the law on the same lines;
it is meeting with a good deal of opposition
from southern manufacturers who indulge in
this form of advertising. The Chamber of
Commerce, the Chamber of Manufactures and
other bodies have for many years urged uni-
formity in Food and Drugs Acts. It would
be an advantage to Australian commerce if
uniformity in the laws governing the sale and
advertising of all goods could be obtained.
# * *
“Seconds”: There should be a fine
opening for the young Australian chilled-
beef trade in China and Japan. Japan
imports quantities of livestock from
China and Korea, and is now showing
signs of a preference for Queensland
cold-storage beef, when it can be got.
The run by sea from N.Q. meatworks to
ports in the China Seas and thereabouts
is far shorter than the 45 days’ trip to
England. Shipping is the hurdle that will
have to be got over, especially as vessels
for the trade will require to be specially
fitted ; but that is a matter in which the
Japanese themselves might help.
* * :|s *
“Taba”: No ; they’re not being put
back in their jobs. Analysing “S. M.
Herald’s” “Positions Vacant” column for
six consecutive days, and excluding Gov-
ernment Labor Exchange call-ups, I find
that 30 p.c. of the vacancies could be
filled by men, 5 p.c. by boys, 53 p.c. by
women, 9 p.c. by girls and 3 p.c. by men
or women. In effect, there were nearly
twice as many vacancies for women as
for men, and girls have a slight advan-
tage over boys. Most of the jobs offered
to men were for salesmen and can-
vassers ; to women, for machinists in
branches of clothing manufacture.
* * * *
“Darwen”: In spite of the impression
that Lancashire’s hold on the cotton tex-
tile trade is slipping, there is evidence that
the old ingenuity and energy are still
there. Dr. Grenfell, the Labrador mis-
sionary, asked American millowners to
devise a cotton cloth that would be light,
water- and wind-proof, and yet allow the
moisture of perspiration to escape. They
could do nothing, so he turned to Lan-
cashire. After a great deal of research, he
was supplied with the material asked for.
It was worn by the men of the Everest
expedition, and is now catching on with
the general public for weatherproof golf
jackets.

“X.S.”: Justice Duffy had an unpre-
cedented case before him in Melbourne
the other day. Two men were charged
with conspiracy in the matter of alleged
sustenance frauds. One pleaded guilty
and was remanded for sentence; the
other stood his trial and was acquitted.
This left only one party to the con-
spiracy, and as a conspirator must con-
spire with somebody the Court was in
a quandary. It was then decided to dis-
charge the first prisoner on the con-
spiracy count and charge him with false
pretences, and the Law breathed again.
* * * *
“Raeakiaki”: Sentencing a defaulting
Sydney solicitor to 21 months’ imprison-
ment, the Judge said he had taken it
into consideration that the punishment
would weigh extra-heavily on a man in
that position. Isn’t it about time this
fallacious reasoning was exploded? A
well-educated prisoner invariably re-
ceives a decent billet in gaol: he’s made
librarian or given a clerk’s job. And the
chances are that when he is released
the spectre of unemployment and hound-
ing by over-zealous police officers won’t
haunt him. The man who really suffers
most acutely from imprisonment is the
moderately-educated small trader, arti-
san or clerk. He gets no cushy billet,
and when he has finally expiated his
offence he will find it mighty difficult to
make a fresh start.

Some of the time, if not all the time, you must save money, but
if you are Mr. Average Citizen you know that all the time is nearer
the mark.
Whatever your margin on any one week’s salary, it won’t provide
for a sudden necessity to pay, say, £5O or £lOO. No one week’s
salary will provide education for your children, heavy medical
expenses, or comfort in your declining years.
Therefore, to make provision for the big calls, you have to save,
more or less, all the time.

A WOMNA'S
LETTER
The beat of hooves, the song of birds
and the crisp rustle of organdie were
woven into the motif of Ladies’ Day at
Randwick. The sun shone, the sky was
blue, and during the lunch hour, when the
song of the bookie is hushed in the land
and the sex preens itself, every second
woman flew organdie. Whole dresses,
hats and gloves of it were worn by many
of the youngsters, while twenty and up-
wards stepped into line with hat and
gloves or bows and ruffly sleeves. Red
gloves giving a horrible suggestion of
Lady Macbeth occurred occasionally, and
striped or white linen and muslin clothed
the hands of almost all. The white ones
suggest the arm of the Law at night.
Pink, so pale that it looked almost
faded, made some of the most attrac-
tive outfits, and of these the suits with
their small stiffened epaulets were easily
the smartest. Too much femininity palls,
and Paris is already tipping a return to
the more tailored line. Wednesday
brought out both vice-regal groups, and
both the Commonwealth and State Exes,
gathered large-size lunch parties around
them. Beige and brown made a clever
color combination in Lady Isaacs’s frock-
ing, and a shoulder cape of beige edged
with brown fur was a graceful finish.
A shoulder scarf lined with honey color
was the complement to Lady Game’s
brown crepe ; her wide-brimmed hat was
of brown straw with ostrich-feather
mounts in beige and brown. Mrs. Ellis
Fielding Jones’s Patou-pink crepe was
made with caped sleeves ; Ruth Allen
caught the eye with her crimson organdie
hat and gloves ; Mrs. Norman McLeod
wore checked organdie with grace ; Mrs.
Hans Fay was one of the smartest in
her grey suit and high-crowned black hat.
Mrs. John Fairfax fringed her elf-
crowned blue hat with a stiffened eye-
veil ; Miss K. Egan wore neat brown
and white checks and a nigger Baku hat;
royal blue crepe was Mrs. Coen’s choice ;
Mrs. Tom Rolin and Mrs. Christian
Thornett both aired sapphire-blue printed
silks ; pink was the color note struck by
two Melbourne girls, Clarice Louatt and
June Baillieu ; blue-stiffened chiffon was
the right setting for Mrs. Peter Moore’s
fair prettiness ; Mrs. Jim Dickson’s beige
chiffons were spattered with field flowers;
Mrs. Max Clarke, in her brown and white
stripes, and Mrs. Reg Stafford, blonde
and well groomed in black, caught the
eye. Dinah Hordern, Anne Gordon,
Sadie Budge, Helen Hughes and the T. S.
Gordons’ slim Victoria were other nice
girls who helped make the picture.
The Union Club gave the usual
acknowledgment that spring is here and
hung out the awning of rejoicing on
Ladies’ Day. This yearly party is one of
the looked-for events of the race meet-
ing, and streams of homing punters seek
the Bligh-street fastness for the solace of
its various brews. By four o’clock last
Wednesday the club was ready with pink
and white azaleas in her hair and tulips
in her hands to receive her guests, among
whom were the G.-G. and his lady and
Sir PhiliD and Lady Game. President
Consett Stephen and vice-president Shep-
heard Laidley greeted every arrival with
the same shade of friendliness. From
them the woman guest stepped on to be
greeted with offerings of orchids or
spring flowers, and after that you mounted
the few stairs to the dining-room. There
green clusters of balloons had flown
ceilingwards and blinked down on the
great centrepiece of variegated foliage
and fern on tables presided over by
flower dolls, around whose spreading
petal skirts of pink were grouped great
bon-bons, baskets of luscious-looking
berries, which were really ices, the red
of strawberries and cakes of many icings.
Somewhere near the lounge with its life-
size pictures an orchestra murmured, and
over the green lawn at the side of the
club the twilight closed in, grey and soft.
Joy was quaite refaned at the Artists’
Ball, so much so that any curate might
have taken his bishop to it. David
Jones’s ballroom was canopied and fes-
tooned in thick rosy vines which, by a
stretch of imagination, you might have
taken for Jack’s Beanstalk. There was
a slippcry-chute at the top of the room,
which only three daring ones were brave
enough to use. One end- of the room was
hung with interpretations of a, Javanese
Jack the Giant-Killer, by Fred Leist and
others. Near this, Earl Beauchamp,
dressed to represent a seidlitz powder (in
memory of a certain famous ball), enter-
tained. His costume was carried out to
the last detail. It was tight-fitting, half-
white, half-blue, and complete with a
celluloid headdress shaped like a tumbler,
the top of which bubbled with synthetic
froth.
In his party was Frith, as the “saftest
of the family,” crowned with an amaz-
ing orange wig. His wife was a hand-
some Dorothy Vernon. Cartoonist Ted
Scorfield’s wife fluffed in white organdie.
Rayner Hoff gambolled, a plump fairy
with sprouting wings. Albert Collins
popped along as a leprechaun and won
a prize thereby. Dainty Annette McKen-
zie was Mary with her lamb; Gayfield
Shaw and Norman Lindsay were swash-
buckling pirates. Mrs. John Gould was
starry-eyed above black laces; black lace
was the choice of Mrs. Wilfred Fairfax :
Mrs. Norman McLeod sparkled above
organdie ruffles; Enzed’s Mrs. Jim
Lowry’s organdie was checked in black
and white. Mrs. F. J. Davy sat with the
Lashmars and Charlie Westmacott. The
dance president, Dorothy Brunton, Cyril
Ritchard and Madge Elliott came on
after their shows. The Charlie Lloyd
Jones couple, as sports of other days,
were both in checks off the one piece, she
in a tight-fitting costume with a tarn
perched on her head, he in plus fours, a
cap with earflaps tied neatly on the crown,
a drooping moustache and a pipe. They
arrived pushing a tandem bike. D. H.
Soutar brought daughter Helen and
played host to a stag party of old cronies.
Dulcie Deamer was in decorative rags
and tatters ; Violet Roche was Carmen in
her Sunday hat. The Harry Julius pair
and Jimmy Macdonald frivolled might-
ily. Belgium’s Consul-General added a
red velvet cap fashioned on Glengarry
lines to the gaiety ; Dora Jarrett was a
bewitching witch in scarlet; Philip
Game, junior, was a Cossack ; “Giff,” a
sheik.
This is a Rene Pardon photograph of
Norah Cazabon, the latest recruit to the
J. C. Williamson ranks. Norah’s father
is the Albert Cazabon who directs the
music at the Prince Edward Theatre, and
on mother’s side of the family there is
acting talent, so from little parts (she is
one of the guests in “Road House”) she
hopes to step into big. Before turning
professional, the pretty Sydney girl had
played with many amateur companies,
her best work being done with the Im-
pressionist group as the heroine of “Han-
nele.”
b a n - ven by tho«e two young
heiresses Noreen and Patsy Dangar, of
Qostwyck, Armidale, was a swish affair
R ace Week. It filled the Rose
g a y Q o if Q u b with exquisite frocks, the
gij nt j ewe i Sj and hi ac anc j tulips that
breathed of the New England country-
side. xhe gold of daffodil, nasturtium
and broom blazed on the mantelpiece
in the ballroom, and the verandah in
contrast was a cool green glade of fern
and shrub . A pale amber necklet and
earr j n g S emphasised the yellow tones in
the design on Noreen Dangar’s white satin
f roc k; a coronet of coral, which had
belonged to her grandmother, nestled on
sister Patsy’s tresses, and was a rosy
finish to her rhythmic-green dress with
its draped cape. Mrs. Hugh Gordon, the
girls’ mother, in a caped and trained
frock of peach-pink lace, and her padre
husband helped in the entertaining.
“Day Spring Mishandled” is the in-
triguing title of a new play by Mrs. Allen
Clunies Ross, the subject of this May
Moore picture. It is the drama of a
woman whose life has been ruined by
war. The Boer War threw its shadow
over her childhood, the Great War has
shattered her married life,, and when the
play opens still another war is threaten-
ing to take her only son from her. Mrs.
Ross, who is attached to the Uni. as
Tutorial lecturer, is a daughter of Pro-
fessor J. T. Wilson, one time of Sydney
Uni. and for the past 12 years Professor
of Anatomy at Cambridge.
Little fishes
Have their wishes,
Shadows kiss their fellow-shadows;
Ponies shake and leap for pleasure,
Turning over
In the clover,
Fat and full of summer treasure.
That’s a bit of one of the songs that
Pierrot sings, impatient for his Colombine,
in Hugh McCrae and Alfred Hill’s “.Ship
of Heaven.” The Pierrot lyrics are en-
chanting, gossamer-light and full of
moonbeams and memories. Hearing them,
even successful women in the Savoy audi-
ence on Saturday remembered nights in a
spring, five, ten —surely it couldn’t be
fifteen! —years ago, and just-beginning
lovers nestled a bit closer. Musicians
and poets were drawn to the show as
bees to the clover. Alfred and Hugh held
an informal reception on the stage after
the final curtain, and producer Doris
Fitton had a cheery levee still later in the
Independent clubrooms.
The vice-regal Games, the knightly
John Butters and Nuttie Mackellar were
human ingredients who brought appro-
priate names to the Picnic Ball, which was
held in a Palais Royal transformed into
an orchard of flowering peach. Pale-
and deep-pink and white blossom loaded
the spiky boughs of trees which lined the
ballroom. The ready-reckoner declared
there were over 150 trees, which carried
hundreds of thousands of blooms ; and
before each supper-table grew a tree which
bore the name of a host or hostess. The
vice-regals nested in their own plantation,
and here came the G.-G. and Lady Isaacs,
as well as the State Exes. Inlets of gold
lame glittered with every movement of
Lady Isaacs’s gold and ivory brocade ;
while Lady Game’s satins were the shade
of the pale-pink peach-blossom around
her, and a pearl coronet bloomed in her
hair. The secretarying of Noreen Dangar
and Betty Higgins had as much to do
with the triumph as the joy of bringing
your own tucker, plus the price of the
tickets, which was a modest five bob.
Thirty-five years ago a Governor was
a Governor, and only the young and
energetic could have stood up to the
racket. In Earl Beauchamp’s engagement
list of a race week during his term o_
office were two big Government House
balls, a garden party, dinner parties every
night and an exclusive little dance called
a Cotillion. In addition he attended the
race meetings, lunch parties, balls by the
Union Club, and such a staggering
number of more serious duties that the
mind positively reels. But what an im-
petus to the dressmaking and millinery
trades! Three balls and a garden party
in one week at Government House and
a young and good-looking bachelor Earl
for host!
Harry Dangar’s cocktail party in the
Grosvenor Gallery, added to the gaiety
of Race Week. On the walls were hung
Harry’s latest pictures (every second one
or so with the sold sign on it) —stream
and field and tree breathing of the New
England country they adorn. Mrs. Dick
Dangar helped her son to entertain, and
sister Mrs. Denis Allen did her bit, too.
Mrs. Gordon Russell’s black hat, smart
and small, primroses and tulips, yellow
and black and striped, and Woodward
Smith’s grass-green shirt, with its soft,
turned-down collar, achieved the striking
decorative effects of the afternoon. The
Reggie Staffords, the Fred McMasters,
Noel Griffin and his pretty wife, her coat
trimmed up with orchids, were a group
of the artist’s friends from Cassilis way
imbibing a spot of art with the races.
Wal Taylor, in correct blue tailorings,
was an unobtrusive but efficient M.C.
Elwatan, the Robert: Dixsons’ Castle
Hill home, stands a handsome red brick
pile, suggestive of a feudal castle domin-
ating stretching acres of country. Imag-
inative visitors for the first time are some-
what disappointed not to be met with a
drawbridge and moat, but grow more
content when they glimpse the baronial
beams in the great hall. A bunch of
minstrels swept down on the fastness last
Sunday, Nora Williamson bringing her
fiddle, Athos Martelli his ’cello, Harvey
Maple and Elsa Corry their voices—but
Mildred Hill depended on the grand
piano in the house, and wasn’t dis-
appointed. North Shore dwellers from
miles around assembled to hear the
music till the tree-lined and flower-bril-
liant avenue resembled a parking station
for thoroughbred and pedigreed cars.
Tubs of growing orchids, green and
golden, at the portals staggered the be-
holder with their opulence. By the time
the fir-bordered lawns had been navi-
gated, the woman who buys her orchids
one at a time in King-street, or knows
them to nod to through the glass of the
hothouses in the Botanic Gardens, was
simply speechless. Mrs. Walter Swinson,
who arranged the programme, wore be-
flowered flat crepes, and Mrs. Dixson’s
frock was of black marocain, the severity
of its line broken by white-pleated ruffles
which edged the neckline and the short
sleeves.
Winifred Burston, Bob Miller and
Cedric Ashton filled the Adams’s room of
the George Armstrongs’ lovely old Wool-
lahra home with brilliant music in honor
of the 75th birthday of Miss Sarah
Hynes. Barrister Sybil Morrison had
made the cake —an affair of alluring pink
ice—and professional women, Forum
Club members, including the Storey lady,
who is its president, the wife of Premier
Stevens and a little group of Queensland
friends, grouped themselves behind Sarah
as she cut the cake ablaze with 75 candles.
Up in the ballroom of Government
House, knighthoods, 0.8.E5. and such-
like Birthday honors awarded to citizens
were tied into place by the Governor-
General, supported by the State Governor
and a bemedalled galaxy of aides and
secretaries, last Friday. The Bavin house-
hold is now the richer by the Order of St.
Michael and St. George, and the C.J.
Harvey home adds to its treasure-chest
the letters patent of a K.B. Three Royal
Naval Reserve officers’ decorations, as!
well as the bunch of 0.8.E5., civil and.
military, were hung in place; one of
these last went to Phyllis Mary Boissier,
R.R.C., matron of Prince Alfred’s, the
only woman participant in the investiture.
There was a true gorse and heather
flavor about the Overseas Ball when four
upstanding men in kilts heeled and toed
it through a Scots reel, partnered by four !
ladies as adept as themselves. Mrs. C.
G. Lambie was responsible for the intro-.
duction of the spirited dance, and took
part in it herself as light-footedly as any.,
The Blaxland Galleries housed the ball,
which was to benefit the Far West Child-
ren’s Health Scheme, and the Governor
and his lady shed the light of their pres-
ence thereon. Lady Game, who was the
ball’s president, wore diamonds in her
hair, and the diamente on the cape
sleeves of her black chiffons did its best:
to flash just as bravely. Kelso King
brought his lady, whose frock gleanied.
a rich burgundy; secretary Arline
Waddy trailed black velvet, and organiser.
Enid Linton brought ice-green satins to
the merry-making.

Chatter
The most exciting thing about Satur-
day’s meeting at Flemington was the
vision with lacquered hair. The curls
looked as if gold-dust had been blown
upon them. With her man’s tailored suit
of black velvet she contrasted ultra-
feminine extremities —three-inch heels
and black lace gloves. Punters forgot
the lure of the tote and stared at her
in amazement.
The lawns, splashed with the gold of
pansies and Iceland poppies, will not be
given another day-out till the big week
in November. Silver-fox furs graced
almost every well-dressed shoulder —
they made very small fry of bunny and
best end of ’possum, even the stone-
marten of yesterday finding itself well
on the shelf. Mrs. Charlie Lyon wore
a frock of the fashionable string-color
and a smallish white hat. The Winter-
Irving family were in the committee box,
as were also Mrs. Bob Black and
daughter Judy. Mrs. J. H. Keating wore
a modish black hat with her tailored
suit. Neville Collins threw a white fox
upon an all-white background. Mrs.
Barry Thomson believes that lily-of-the-
valley brings her luck, and she carried a
sprig, as always. Betty Darvall had a
green hat and flower. Mrs. Henty de-
cided it was too warm for furs, and took
out her feather boa. Accompanying her
Colonel, Mrs. Eric Harrison was in
fashion’s newest coat of the half-way
sleeve. Beneath was a frock patterned
with blue field flowers. Mrs. Mortill
wore a beige coat with rust-red motifs
around neck and sleeve.
Young things emerged all frills and
flounces from sedans drawn up outside
the Robert Knox portals. The Toorak
mansion, loaded with garden spoil,
twinkled from every window in anticipa-
tion of its scoop for the Alfred and the
D.N.S. Still thicker padding to its cheque
was added by first-aid to hungry and
thirsty dancers. Mrs. Knox moved round
in a gown of smoke-blue ninon. Nell
Healy, in topaz velvet, and Joan Govett,
in dull-surfaced ivory satin, were ticket
secs. Two pretty cousins were Deb
Hackett, of Adelaide, and Mary Drake-
Brockman. Mrs. Cleve Kidd’s color
scheme was pink. Eunice Umphelby had
a twirl upon the shoulder of her del-
phinium transparency, and black was
chosen by Rosa Spowers. The Tom
Granthams and Mrs. Harold Darling
were givers of pre-dance dinner parties.
Mrs. Charles Lort Smith and her sis-
ter, Marion Montgomery, chose No. 9
for their party. They had 170 welcom-
ings to perform, and guests enjoyed
themselves so much that a late-afternoon
beginning finished well on in the even-
ing—dinner isn’t worth bothering about
when there are little sausages on sticks
simply asking to be nibbled. A lip-top
band beckoned the dancing people to
make use of the ballroom, and chatty
folk merged among irises and glowing
tulips in the reception-room. Mrs. Lort
Smith wore a smart black garment, its
crepe surface showing a motif of hand-
made lace upon the corsage. Miss Mont-
gomery was also in black, with a stiffened
bow upon the crown of her picture hat.
To the Green Mill one afternoon went
1200 bridge players, each with her best
hat clapped over one ear and in her heart
a fluttering hope that she would come
home the richer for a platinum-and-
diamond ring. The leviathan affair was
intended to smooth the financial pathway
for the Queen Victoria Hospital’s
Queen, Elaine Brookes. Elaine has be-
hind her the support of her mother, the
hospital’s president, who donated the
piece of jewellery making a lucky day
for Mrs. Roland Dixon. A swarm of
helpers scurried about with teacups and
raffles or attracted those with shillings to
spend into a nest of stalls filled with
tempting fripperies.
Hunting people who visited the Cran-
bourne point-to-point had a good day’s
fun and much hot tea to wash down their
muddiness. Hylda McCardel and Nancy
Holt fought out the finish over 39 fences
and five miles of grassland. Honors went
to Miss McCardel, who, with Mrs. Ken
Moore (she had a tumble on the way)
and Noel Mason in third and fourth
places, made up the trio that kept up
Findon Harriers’ end. Winnie Wood-
mason dug her heels into Simplicity to
come in winner of the women’s point-
to-point. Happiest among the onlookers
were those in closed cars.
The Vic. Artists’ Society ran up the
curtain on its spring show with an
at-home in the Albert-street haunt. P.
M. Carew-Smyth was determined to be
brief and pithy. He wound up his speech
with the sad tale of the Papuan boy who
did in his spouse—the lady was the vil-
lage’s champion yam-digger but she
talked too much. President Louis
McCubbin buzzed about feeding every-
body with chocolate cakes and second
cups of coffee —he had a stretch of coral
sea upon the wall. General Chauvel and
his lady were there, also John Long-
staff and the Bill Mclnnes couple, Mrs.
Mclnnes in blistered pink crepe hung
with brown fur. Others who prowled
among the canvases were Mrs. Russell-
Jackson, in black ; Mrs. Edward Dyson,
all vivacity and blonde curls, and Mrs.
Sep Power, wearing a remarkable neck-
let of crystal and ebony. Sculptor Paul
Montford, with wife and daughters in
the offing, was meditative behind his
smallish beard. Mrs. Leckie, with a whirl
of black organdie sleeves, was a figure
in the ever-changing groups of arty folk.
Metropolitan hospital Queens are
gathering votes with both hands and
scarcely a pause for breath. The Homoeo-
pathic’s choice, Mrs. Tutton, was queen
bee of the buzz of conversation which
emanated from a bridge party in The
Cottage at George’s. The shivoo proved
so popular that the rustic teashop over-
flowed its tables on to the kitchen garden.
Mrs. Tutton made her bids in browny-
striped silk crepe. Betty Fellowes, in
green, with a steps-and-stairs neckline,
Margot McKenzie, with a frilly blouse
ornamentation to her blue marocain, and
Joan Oldmeadows, in black, made up
the secretarial trio. Meat for the finan-
cial sandwich was provided with sales
of nuts and chocs, and the raffling of
silk stockings.
Pink and white peach-blossom blew in
a hedgerow round the dais where song-
birds perched at the Austral Salon. Edith
Billinghurst shouldered the organising.
Jessie Batchelor, Isobel Duncan, Rose
Walton, May Broderick and George
Chant were among those whose talents
caused a hush in the chatter.
The profile on this page belongs to the
wife of ex-Agent-General George Fair-
bairn. She is organising a dance in aid
of the Big Brothers’ proteges. Among
her interests are the Alfred Hospital,
which has chosen her for its Queen in
the current competition, and the Animal
Welfare League.
The Vic. Liedertafel, all spruced up in
white ties and a pert buttonhole here
and there, selected songs of old England
for the first half of its concert at the
Town Hall. Henry Eight’s “Pastyme
with Good Companye” (that he did it
himself is well documented) was included
among ditties about a cow called
Hawkie, bushes, briars and a round dated
1240 which announces that summer is
imminent. Conductor Fred Earn sue-
eested that the andienee should sit for

Below is Mrs. Hugh McCubbin, a por-
traitist who has exhibited a head in char-
coal of son and heir John Quentin, and
is looking forward to painting her twins,
still toddlers. After spending the last few
years in the service of her young family
Mrs. McCubbin has lately re-entered the
world of art. At the end of her school-
days she came from Queensland to the
National Gallery, following the con-
clusion of her course there with an early
marriage. Pastels attract her. Her hus-
band is a son of the late Frederick
McCubbin.
Sydney girls Margaret McKellar and
Joan Long-Innes have been lured to this
city by squash-rackets tournaments. Mrs.
J. M. Pittendrigh lunched them and a
bunch of other guests at the Quamby
club, popping a picture of a tennis star
on each name-card and a nosegay of
primroses near each white-and-blue plate.
Perth’s pleasant occasions:
Half the city went to Nortliam for the Cen-
tenary Ball, and folk from the surrounding dis-
tricts rallied in full force. The stage of the
Town Hall, where sat the Governor and many
another official guest, was fenced off with minia-
ture white pickets enclosing a garden of spring
flowers. There was a parade of period cos-
tumes, and Griffen’s instrumentalists discoursed
old-time tunes for the dancing. Mayor Nor-
they’s spouse was seen in an old-world, trained
polonaise gown of lavender corded silk, liberally
sprinkled with ecru Valenciennes lace; Mrs.
Harley Colebatch, who had the box seat on
the ball committee, was panniered in puce velvet
with puffed satin sleeves and cream lace
bertha; Mary Middleton’s cream taffeta was
made a quarter of a century ago and fashioned
with leg-o’-mutton sleeves and a transparent
yoke of cream guipure lace and high-boned
collar; Beryl Withnell’s turquoise-blue satin
knew a still earlier dressmaker, and had a
Maltese lace bertha; Mrs. Charles Mills’s
travelling dress of 60 years ago was fawn satin
with fringed frills and a bonnet of violets and
black lace; Hazel Morrell’s bustle dress of
brown figured taffeta had a deep fichu of coffee
lace; Mrs. Rogers’s lavender-and-black bom-
bazine was worn with a black lace shawl and
ringleted hair, and Mrs. J. G. Meares wore
black moire silk fashioned 125 years ago, with
fluted chiffon pelerine and draped cap of
Maltese lace.
In spite of the grey skies prevailing at the
Hunt Club races at Belmont, the optimists who
donned organdies held their own till the last
race, when the stiffening was taken out of them
by the gentle patter of raindrops. President
J. J. Poynton had his niece Mabel Teather,
whose lissome lines were tucked into Burgundy
fiat crepe, to aid him with his duties as host.
Mrs. Ted Blackham wore a hip-length squirrel
coat over black crinkle crepe, and Mrs. Barr
Goyder’s handsome chocolate outfit was touched
here and there with white. A cute white bow
on a black Alpine hat surmounted the huge
collar of Betty Blackman’s black greatcoat.
In between buying a trousseau and preparing
for a trip to Sydney, where her nuptial vows
will be made, Dora de Witt has been rushing
from one party to another. Pippin Carew-Reid
gave one at her parents’ new flat; Dorothy
James prepared tables for bridge; tennis togs
and racquets were the equipment for ex-head-
mistress Annie Nisbett’s party; Nancy Alnutt
wrapped herself in black lace to receive the
guest of honor, becomingly girt with green
flowered chiffons; Mollie Manning, who sails
with Dora to do ’maid duties at the wedding,
gave a bathroom tea at her home in Cottesloe.
Mayoress Sinclair smothered the lounge of
her home with ’roo paws, daffodils and pussy-
willow to entertain the women’s committee of
the Economic Council. Blue-and-white striped
crepe de Chine showed on her Lido-blue flat
crepe as she applauded songs and monologues.
Daughter Iris’s bois-de-rose angel-skin gown
was seen in the daisy-decked dining-room, where
teacups were circulated.
The A. C. Davidsons have packed their
trunks and returned to Sydney after doing a
round of parties. The day before their depar-
ture they gave a farewell cocktail gathering at
the Esplanade, where the hostess’s black
chiffons were seen wandering from the rose- and
gladioli-decked reception-rooms to the flag-
draped balconies, where guests were ensconced
in easy-chairs.
Nessie Horgan, botanical demonstrator at the
Uni. and daughter of the Children’s Court dis-
penser of justice, is displaying a diamond ring,
gift of Austin Lambert, of South Perth.
Adelaide’s round of parties:—•
Young folk had a good time at the dance
given by Mrs. Kenneth Bakewell at her resi-
dence, Fitzroy, for her daughters, Helen and
Gwen. Deep rose-pink flowering peach, sweet-
peas and roses decorated the drawing-room used
lor dancing, and in the supper marquee were
daffodils and primroses, with pale green candles
in brass candlesticks. The hostess wore white
and pink flowered chiffon, Helen chose prim-
rose silk net, and Gwen was in rose-pink velvet-
Spring weather encouraged some of the
women to appear in light frocks at the Hunt
Club race meeting at Morphettville. H. Young
(president) assisted by Mrs. Young, in a navy
costume and black hat, entertained a large
crowd at afternoon tea. Mrs. Ernest Luxmoore
(wife of the Master) was frocked in white crepe
de Chine, faintly patterned in brown, with large
frilled elbow sleeves, a sash of brown cire satTn
and a brown straw hat.
Rosemary Fleischmann, niece of Lady Hore-
Ruthven, who has been a guest at Government
House throughout the winter, has left us to
have a peep at the Eastern States before return-
ing to England.
Very successful was the Danse Cabaret for the
Queen’s Home, organised by the president, Mrs.
Lavington Bonython. Lady Hore-Ruthven was
received by Mrs. Bonython and presented with
a sheaf of flowers that toned with her flesh-
colored satin toilette brocaded in the same
shade. The v.-r. table was decorated with pink
and mauve sweet-peas. In a pageant of “Fashion
Down the Ages,” arranged by the president,
Shirley Stevens was Eve in little trunks of
leaves and brassieres to match. Roma Wadey,
in white shorts and shirt, carrying a racquet,
represented 1933. There were ballets by pupils
of Nora Stewart and Dorothy Slane. The 16
pretty girls who took part in the old-world
concert repeated the minuet in their eighteenth-
century frocks.
Frank Downer, as vice-president of the Royal
Society of St. George, was host of a garden
party at his home, Burnside. Mr. Downer’s
two sisters, Mrs. S. B. Rudall and Mrs. O.
Shomurgk, assisted to entertain the guests. The
garden was in full flower and rooms set with
afternoon tea tables was charmingly decorated.
The Children’s Hospital benefited as the re-
sult of a golf gymkhana and bridge party organ-
ised by the S.A.L.G.U., at the Mt. Osmond
Country Club, the joint secretaries being Mrs.
M. Ericksen and Ethel Wyatt. About 300
golfers were present, and 20 tables were
booked for bridge. His Ex. and Lady Hore-
Ruthven arrived in time for luncheon, and
took part in the golf afterwards.
A few lines fom the sea-girt State:
For years the Speck’s Parliament has been
opened with a minimum of frills, but there
was a leaven of pomp and circumstance in
this year’s ceremony. His Ex. arrived with a
military escort in full parade kit and read his
Speech impressively. Lady Clark wore a black
cloth coat with deep fur collar and hat in
fuchsia tones of velvet. In the throng were the
Elliott Lewis lady, Mayoress Hungerford, Mrs.
Gellibrand, Mrs. W. B. Propsting and Mrs.
Tom Murdoch.
His Ex. and Lady Clark made their official
debut at Elwick on a day of grey skies that
gave a threat of rain. Pretty frocks were
covered by coats, but the swagger surtouts
affected by most of the womeh were gay, and
were topped with impertinent little hats set at
rakish angles, so the effect was lively. T.A.J.C.
president Col. David Young, aided by his wife,
who wore a smart black-and-white costume,
entertained a big crowd at tea in the president’s
room, where the tables were gay with soring
blossoms.
Their Exes, attended St. Joseph’s Convent’s
dance and bridge party at the Continental.
Lady Clark, clad in midnight-blue chiffon
velvet, received a round dozen of debs. —Vera
O’Brien, Jeanne Balmer, Nell Ryan, Tessie
Batchelor, Elsie Bezverkof, Gwen Kiernan, Mar-
jorie Bruce, Joyce Fitzmaurice, Marjorie Barnes,
Nancy Stevens, Mollie Wigmore and Dorothy
McCarthy. Dr. T. Gaha’s wife presented the
buds, who had been trained to drop their
curtseys by Gladys Smith and W. Paton.
The Sanatorium Carnival at Launceston
Grammar School was a double-barrelled affair,
with an open-air fete in the beautiful old
grounds in the afternoon, and a ball in the big
dining-room of the school in the evening. The
Mayor launched the bazaar. For the hop, the
dining-hall was converted into a shipboard scene
and all guests had to sign the log-book.
Mollie Davern, who has penned the social
pages of the “Tasmanian Mail” for the last
few years, and who has transferred her ser-
vices to a Melbourne journal, was entertained
at many farewell parties. Among others who
gave her a send-off were the Tom Murdochs,
Mrs. Haddon-Cave, Mrs. Chesterman and Mrs.
Chas. Finlay.
Bellerive Town Hall was packed for the
Wattle Ball in aid of the Sanatorium. His Ex.
and Lady Clark went across the water to be
present, and all the leading lights of the Wattle
League rolled up. Ella Chapman was an efficient
sec. Ferry boats brought contingents of
bright young things from town, and the eastern
side gave the shivoo solid support.
Mrs. Arthur Stourton, back from the N.C.W.
Conference at Stockholm, has been recounting
her experiences. She speaks warmly of the
qualities of Scandinavian hospitality.

FROM CHINA TO PERU.
“Salamaua”: Australian initiative,
which first conceived the notion of estab-
lishing passenger and goods services by
air into the almost inaccessible mountain
goldfields of New Guinea, has not been
long in winning the flattery of imitation.
The rich new goldfield discovered in
Arctic Labrador proved almost as hard
to reach as the New Guinea areas. A
’plane service has been instituted to what
has been called “another Klondyke”
from St. John’s, and the field may now
be reached in two hours. Previously
prospectors had to wait for the spring
thaw.

Most Diggers have kindly recollections
of Exeter, even if they saw no more of
it than the railway station—it was a
junction for the trains between Devon-
port and Salisbury Plains. There was
always good entertainment for the sol-
diers, plus a standing invitation at A.I.F.
H.Q., London, for Diggers on leave to
stay at various country houses around
and in the cathedral city. The organisa-
tion that provided all this was arranged
by the Mayor and Mayoress, who kept
office during all the war years. The pair,
Sir James and Lady Owen, are about
to visit Australia, and the R.S.L. is mak-
ing arrangements to show that Diggers
do not forget.

“Cash Amateur”: Cochet has defi-
nitely turned professional and Vines may
follow suit, though his stock has slumped
in view of his poor showing this season.
In a way neither player can be blamed.
Eveiy leading amateur in the game is
making a good thing of his proficiency
under the lap, and this has been recog-
nised for years. In fact, considering that
90 per cent, of the amateurs have no
apparent means of livelihood unless they
detive it from first-class tennis, it is im-
possible to ignore the truth. The chances
are that before long open tourneys, with
amateurs and declared professionals
playing together, must be recognised,
since the present system is a transparent
sham.

Percy F. S. Spence, who died in Lon-
don recently, was one of The Bul-
letin band of black-and-white men
in the ’nineties. Spence and Frank
Mahony were among the first outside
artistic contributors; Minns, Souter,
Lambert, Leist, Fischer and Garlick —
other giants of the period—did not arrive
until years after. Hopkins, Vincent,
Durkin and G. R. Ashton were staff
men. Spence was born at Balmain (Syd-
ney) in 1868 and spent his boyhood in
Fiji, where his father was an official.
He contributed drawings to The Bulletin
and the “Sydney Mail” for about eight
years, and in 1898 went to London. Like
many other Australian artists he did
well there. His work appeared in lead-
ing illustrated journals, and a painting
he did of Robert Louis Stevenson was:
snapped up by the National Portrait
Gallerv.

“General Prac.”: I suggest that the
Sydney C. 1.8. should abandon its re-
searches into simian finger-prints (B.
6/9/’33) and concentrate instead upon
the human mouth. When Charles the
Bold took the count at Nancy in 1477
the hostile Lorrainers ripped off his
armor and pounded his body into an
unrecognisable pulp. But somehow they
failed to break the duke’s lower jaw,
which for years had been short, of several
front teeth, so that it was soon spotted
by somebody who had known him in
happier days. In 1849 an American pro-
fessor, one Webster, killed a colleague
named Parkman and pushed the corpse
into a laboratory furnace. The fire made ■
a job of everything but a gold and plati-j
num denture in the dead man’s mouth ;
the discovery of this brought Webster to
the scaffold. More than once thieves
have left damning tooth-marks behind
them on larder supplies ; at Carlisle in
1906 a burglar was convicted solely be-
cause the dents in a cheese fitted his
molars. And a baser criminal was once
apprehended because his tusks corres-
ponded exactly with the scars on a
woman’s neck. Any good dentist will
always recognise his own handiwork, and
it won’t take him long to produce a chart
of a patient’s mouth.

“The Antiquary”: The beard’s popu-
larity in England (B. 20 /9 / ’33) has
always been ephemeral. The Saxons,
though they grew the hair of head and
upper lip long, shaved the chin, and
the Normans were both shaven and close-
cropped. As a result probably of the
Crusades, the beard had a run during
the thirteenth century, but it was only a
short one. Henry VIII. did something to
revive the mode, but the opposition was
strenuous, and lawyers wearing beards
were prohibited from sitting at the great
table at Lincoln’s Inn. Elizabeth’s attempt
to tax every beard 3s. 4d. failed through
ridicule, but under the early Stuarts the
beard came into its own, and assumed a
wide variety of guises, ranging from the
screw and stiletto forms to the Vandyke
and the broad or cathedral type, favored
by churchmen. Later, hirsute adorn-
ments went completely out of favor, to
be revived after the Crimea, soldiers on
active service having been allowed to
forego the use of the razor for obvious
reasons. The moustache came in at the
same time, fathered by G. F. Muntz, a
Birmingham M.P., who was the sole
bearded and moustached member of the
House of Commons in 1857. Yet even
then civil servants and private employees
were sacked for adopting the fashion,
and the Bank of England’s ordinance
that “clerks are not to wear moustaches
during business hours” is famous.


The Musketeer.
BY MARGARET FANE AND HILARY LOFTING.
MARY not being there to ginger him
up, Marty was drifting round the
living-room. He had an object, but
—well, he was in a drifting mood. The
shop was closed; Brazier-street was
quiet in the summer evening light; and
she ought to be home by now. She was
not long up after a bad go of bron-
chitis, and she ought to be home.
He loitered over to the stove, turned the
gas down under the kettle, and came to the
corner of the sideboard where he kept
his pipes and tobacco-jar. This was his
object. He took the lid off the jar,
looked into it, looked reproachfully
round the empty room, and put the lid
back.
Empty. She’d forgotten to fill it. Or
didn’t mean to fill it—never meant to
fill it again, perhaps....
Disconsolately, he took a packet of
cigarettes from his pocket—boys’ fags,
as you might say—lit one in his skilful
one-handed way, and flicked the match
at the kettle. It wasn’t a smoke; but
he supposed it was a sort of a smell.
Mary said she couldn’t stand his old
pipe in her room, not with bronchitis
as well, she said. So he was a cigarette-
fiend now. And she wouldn’t fill his
jar with his special mixture (which she
always bought for him), though she was
well of the bronchitis and able to stand
an extra smell or so.
No good.
She wasn’t bound to look after him,
of course ; he was quite able to walk
across the Domain to Castlereagh-street
and buy his own tobacco. Only, all
these years she’d done it for him, for
the ’Loo’s odd-job man whom she’d mar-
ried and stood on his feet, putting the
breath of life and happiness into him.
And he liked finding his tobacco-jar
filled and ready for him. It was —well,
he liked it.
Sick of him, perhaps, after all these
years. That wasn’t to be wondered at;
you couldn’t blame her for that. Age,
the gradual quenching of all fires,
mocked his serious face a moment.
Well—he crushed out the cigarette on
the ash-tray —there were the scraps to
be collected and Marco the dog to be
fed, anyhow. There was always one’s
job.
He turned the gas still lower and
went down the three steps into the twilit
shuttered shop which had' been home for
all these years. In the smallgoods wire-
gauze cage the rich smells greeted him,
evoking their, first impact on his nostrils
when the cage had been new and he
prouder of it than Lucifer. You couldn’t
help the years passing and life growing
narrow and cold. He might get another
cut or two off the hambone, but (he
dropped it in the bucket) Marco was a
raw, hungry sort of a dog.
If the narrow times took the softness out
of life no one was to blame. Nor was there
anything to growl about. Remembering
his tobacco was a softness —two broken
eggs and a heel of stringy corned beef:
Marco would burst —and it didn’t do to
make softness too important. If you
could help it. He added a sardine with
a broken back to Marco’s bucket of
scraps and went out into the yard. He
could do without the tobacco if he had
to. But. ...
The days had drawn out; the evening
light was as strong as sunshine in the
yard. He must get to that old shed
soon and clear out the packing-cases and
the broken furniture —ought to have
been done months ago. Marco, in
whimpering ecstasy, threw himself upon
Marty, seized the bucket, and slipped
into the shadow by the back door with
it, his tail flagging his gratitude. This
was his best trick.
Marty smiled. A quiet summer even-
ing, a dog at his tea, your home
The yard gate burst. A tall, heavy
man hurled himself across the asphalt
and stood trembling before Marty.
“Quick! Hide me!” he sobbed —
the man was livid with terror —“Quick,
mister —they’ll get me!”
Marty stared at him. “Who?” he
whispered.
“The whole mob of ’em”- The
man’s white, handsome face was savage
with urgency and panic. “Call yer
damned dog off! A hiding-place,” he
begged.
“Down, Marco!” Marco went back to
his bucket. “Why are they after you?”
Marty asked, bewildered.
“Why?” For a shadowy second he
paused in the flight of his terror to watch
Marty’s face, his eyes thoughtful even
in their terror. “They’ve good reason,”
he muttered. “It’s life and death —hide
me!”
“Life and death! ” Marty looked at the
open gate, slipped across, shut it, and
came back. “Life and death —you ve
killed someone,” he whispered, peering
at the man.
“And if I have?” The rich hoarse
voice filled the dying day with pride and,
somehow, the righting of wrongs. “But
hide me!” The panic was riding him
again. “Just for two days, a day, to-
night! Long enough to break the
scent I’ll tell you why I” he
gulped again and ceased, his longing,
haunted eyes imploring Marty.
Marty’s heart melted in pity. 'Poor,
hunted fellow-man “Quick! ” he said,
dragging the man to the old shed. “In
here”—he opened the door. “Get
behind the packing-cases —there’s an old
stretcher” The sound of running
footsteps came beating up the lane. The
man clutched Marty’s arm ; they stood
in trembling silence while the footsteps
passed, died away, were gone.
“Slip in there —the cases will hide you,”
Marty whispered. “I’ll bring you a
candle and some food.”
He was out in the yard again, the shed
door shut behind him.
It wasn’t two minutes since the poor
fellow had burst into the yard, but it
seemed like an hour. Poor wretch! And
that note of pride and scorn in his husky
voice Marty crept into his own
shop and smallgoods cage like a thief,
and crept out again back to the shed.
The man was sitting on the stretcher,
his fine, handsome head in his hands.
In the failing light from the high, win-
dow he was a picture of sorrow and
despair.
“I didn’t ask if you wanted food,”
Marty apologised, “but I brought”
“I do, I do,” he interrupted, his rich
voice sombre and deep. “I’m spent and
weary with the long road of the hunted.
Thank you, thank y0u”.... He lifted
his haggard face, peered up at Marty.
“The grey early morning,” he murmured,
“the rope”....
Marty shuddered. “Don’t say that,”
he begged. “You —you’ll escape. Have
some tongue.”
“Thanks. Escape—shall I ever escape,
even if I go free?” His voice murmured
gravely in the shadows of the old shed.
“We don’t escape,” he said, taking the
tongue and some bread. “Except by
death.”
Marty shuddered again, fascinated.
“I know we’re no good”—the tones
were lighter now and sharp with
mockery—“but we have our lives to live.
And sometimes we get somehing done.
Anyhow, there’s one traitor less in the
world to-night”.... He finished the
tongue and dusted the crumbs from his
fingers. “But I won’t speak of that to-
night—l’ll spare you that.”
“I must go back,” Marty explained.
“My wife may be in any minute now.
You get a good sleep—there’s a rug there
and some coats —and to-morrow we’ll
get you away.”
“Thanks.” The man’s face was drawn
and haunted once more. “You haven’t
got a cigarette, have you?”
Marty gave him his packet. “Good
night,” he said. “Don’t let your candle-
fight show at the window.”
Terror leapt into the fine eyes again.
“My God, no,” he whispered. “Good
night. And God bless you.”
This benediction echoed in Marty’s
ears throughout his silent tea with Mary.
Mary glanced at him once or twice, as
if she were going to speak; but she
didn’t do so. There was a —a magnifi-
cence about the man. Of course he
was a bad fellow, an out-and-out bad
’un. But you couldn’t tell; the older
you got the surer you were that you
couldn’t tell.
The man reminded Marty of a book
he’d read once, a book about old times
and three musketeers in France. They
were wrong ’uns most of the time.
But
“Is it meself that does the washing-up
by meself, then?” Mary inquired from
the sink.
“I’m sorry, Mary, my dear. I —l was
thinking.”
“Catch a-hold of the tea-towel,” was
her comment on this.
But in the night Marty knew that he
was harboring a desperate, a dangerous
criminal; that made him part of it, he
knew —he could be imprisoned. This
looked pretty serious at first; but
towards dawn the harboring of murderers
in your shed —well, it wasn’t narrow or
cold, anyhow. And he’d get the man
away in the morning....
But he didn’t. He took in a good
breakfast as a preparation for the long
road of the hunted, and found him
smoking a cigarette and staring at the
rafters.
“There was nothing in the paper,” he
pointed out gently.
“An old dodge,” the fugitive answered
bitterly. “The police suppress the re-
ports so as to give the idea that
nothing has been discovered and that
we’re safe to come out into the open.
But we’re on to all their tricks.” He
took a mouthful of ham. “No,” he
added, sadly, “I shan’t be safe for a
week.”
“A week?” Marty blanched. “But
you said”
“I know, I know. But who can tell
what the night brings? I saw the hard,
stern faces of the jury ; I saw the Judge
put on his black cap.” His rolling voice
dropped a tone. “I saw the rope
again.... The night was full of horror.
And empty of sleep. We don’t sleep
much.”
There was a gauntness, a haggard
sort of splendor about the way he said
this. Marty in spirit began to keep step
with the outlaws and outcasts of the
world. That roystering book about the
three wrong ’uns came back to his
mind. After all, who was wrong and
who was right?-
“You said you’d tell me about”
“No. I said I’d spare you that. We
don’t care to boast. If a wrong is
righted by one of us —perhaps at the
cost of his life or liberty —well enough.
The thing is done and is its own reward.”
“Reward?” Marty stared at him.
“Is there no reward in duty done?”
The deep voice was heavy with reproach.
“Is there nothing in courage? Why,
even I”
A mysterious light came into his eyes
watching Marty. Secrets —rich, dark
secrets, not narrow nor cold ; Marty felt
that a door was held ajar for a moment
before it was closed again. More than
ever the man looked like one of those
musketeers: debonair and full of the
courage of the world.
There was more in this than he had
thought. He had often wondered why
there were so many criminals.
All the morning the fine, handsome
murderer hiding in the shed haunted him.
He saw that the stranger lacked nothing
in food or cigarettes ; he slipped out often
to see that he was all right and to hear
him speak.
Night came again. Mary glanced at
him once or twice again at tea; but
she didn’t speak. Nor he ; his mind was
full of a half-seen pageantry and withal
of a deep pity. They were a sort of
genius who had to be looked after —
he had heard of that —because they
couldn’t look after themselves. Well, he
would see that one at least of them
should be well looked after.
There was a kick in it, too. A fine,
strong kick ; he couldn’t remember when
the days had seemed so full of life. He’d
be half-sorry when the criminal did go.
Mary being out, he took a pot of
afternoon-tea and some cake down to
the shed. The man was in one of his
expansive moods, and Marty stayed to
listen.
“You will remember,” the husky sweet-
ness of his voice filled the shed with
unknown glories, “that I spoke of the
rope at our first meeting.”
Marty shuddered. “Yes, indeed,” he
said, refilling the murderer’s cup.
“Well, that is not so” he paused.
Footsteps were crossing the yard.
Marty put down the teapot, stood rigid,
his heart shaking with terror. *
The shed door was thrown open and
Mary came in, followed by Constable
O’Leary and a woman. These came
round the packing-cases in silence.
Marty’s heart missed a beat, and
raced forward as if it were trying to
choke him. All the care and protection
for nothing—the poor wretch Here
were the police! It was the rope after
a 11....
The woman broke the silence. “Well,
Bob,” she said tartly to the murderer.
“What’s the game?”
The murderer blushed and put down
his piece of cake. “Er—friend of mine,
looking after me, Polly dear,” he said
apologetically, and waving his empty
hand towards the stricken Marty.
“Why?” she demanded. “How did
you get here?”
“Er” he glanced at Constable
O’Leary’s massive face. “Got into a
bit of a row,” he went on sullenly, “and
gave Harris one in the jaw.”
“I bet it wasn’t a big one. Go on.”
“They were all after me —going to
tear me to pieces. And I nipped in
here.”
“Lord, lord,” she looked at him. “You
had more guts when you were playing
opposite me in one-night fit-ups in the
smalls. What about me and my poultry-
farm?”
“Well, my dear,” his voice was smooth
now, “you were away”
“Of course I was away. I told you
1 was going down to Canley to sign the
papers and take over the place. And
that if you didn’t come I’d do it on my
own and come back here for you. It’s
my money and I’ve done it—l’ve got
the place”
“Listen,” O’Leary put in, glaring offi-
cially from face to face, “what am I
do ing here? Mrs. Day reported that a
crime had been”
“Sure, ’twas my mistake, officer,”
Mary told him gently. “It was only a
smack in the jaw and not a crime. I
h eard them talking in the shed here and

Into the Wilderness.
Help me to see the beauty of the desert!
Inhuman angels, move and grasp my hand:
And, though your touch be cold as skulls m
moonlight,
Lead me to understand!
Though some may call you Winds-of-Desolation,
And others Emptiness, or Clouds-of-Death,
And though no cheek of yours, the mute, the
faceless,
Touches me, and no breath
Brushes my lips from rose-lips stooped from
Heaven
That yet is homely as the low-pitched tent,
Some faith beyond faith sows dark stars before
me
Where night’s black void is bent.
The rocks uprising, cragged as ocean caverns,
Circle vast amphitheatres, where the dust
Is printless save for ripples. One great planet,
Green-silver, does encrust
The spine o’ the rock. My birth-night star,
my Saturn,
The guide beyond the uttermost; white fate,
Veiled in the green of change and wildernesses,
Ward of a nameless gate!
The dark, the deathly, rock-wrought desert
portal,
That leads from the loved senses into night.
Planet of loss and silence, I am human!
Here is no home-fire’s light.
The hearth that was my hearth, it lies behind
me —
How far? A step, a year, a wizard-pace?
Dearer than blood were the small things about
it;
Dearer than these, a face.
Ah, the home-coming from the narrow markets,
And the pierced lattice with the lamp behind;
The food, the drink, the news, the little
laughters;
The thin heartstrings that bind.
My guide, my rod, my fate, green-silver Saturn,
Your mailed, metallic hand unlatched the
door,
And then the desert air was keen against me,
Blowing from steppe and tor.
Where was the refuge-city, where the lattice
That overhung the hearLfamiliar street?
The market-place, the sellers’ cries, love’s
homing
On weary human feet?
My guide, my star-fate! Lord of strange
horizons
Beyond men’s and beyond the gods we
knew!
A voice as still as death promises morning
Spangled with manna-dew
Dawn on the desert. Violet, lilac, golden;
Pillars of marble cloud and rocks of rose.
Inhuman angels, stand! The easts arched o'er
me; ,
Its doors of might unclose.

"Hip-I-Addy.”
BY RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
Mr. WILLIAM COLLOPY, J.P., used
only the highly respectable and
official end of the Street of Magic
until fate and the pursuit of a National-
ist nomination led him to the little block
that holds the Caravanserai and its rivals.
His habit held to the straight and nar-
row way of the northern end of the
street, where honesty is advertised by the
brass plates of solicitors and commission
agents, and from that end his commer-
cial adventures rarely called him. North
of him were the central offices of the
political association whose favor he
sought; south, the broad road to the Post
Office and the banks and the stock-
brokers’ sweetness and light.
Politics drew Mr. Collopy, J.P., out of
habit, as politics draw all men. The fever
before the experience of politics is almost
as strong as the gratified love of position
after enjoyment of it. Mr. Collopy, J.P.,
had the desire for political position with
only the perfunctory campaigning neces-
sary in a pocket borough. The winning
of a nomination made the individual im-
portant as it made the thousands negli-
gible ; made the primary selection the be-
all and end-all of the affair, and the actual
election by the people who voted his
ticket a matter of form.
Therefore had Mr. Collopy, J.P., done
all those things which he should have done,
and none of those things which he should
not have done ; and his party believed
there was health in him. He had only
one sport, one delight in the chase: the
hunting of the limelight—an annual not
so shy as it should be, and always in
season.
He haunted public dinners which his
weak stomach would not permit him to
eat. He attended such funerals as are
featured by daily papers as representative.
He talked on the Starving Poor of
Europe; jumped into the discussion
whether Sydney is more Immoral than
Melbourne. So he had stayed as a name
in the newspapers, which is Fame ; and
he had never expressed the unorthodox,
which is to be notorious.
There are more women than men in
Sydney suburban electorates, and there
were more women than men in branches
of the National Federation. So he needed
the women’s vote.
Behold him then, that circumspect little
man, frail and abstemious, his pointed
grey whiskers covering his undershot
chin, his little eyes of a ferret carrying
endless votes of confidence in himself,
his pointed ears hearing at once the thing
he pursues and its own pursuer—Mr. Col-
lopy, J.P., in the vestibule of the Cara-
vanserai to keep a tea engagement, and
very self-conscious and ashamed over it.
He found himself mixed up in a crowd
of cocktail-connoisseurs and lounge-
lizards, female pirates and respectable
girls trying to be “smart,” an occasional
male breaking the waves of short dresses,
of low transparent blouses showing the
pink of flesh and blue ribbon mistily half-
concealed to mark the shadowy boundary
between clothes and woman.
Mr. Collopy, J.P., was embarrassed,
almost submerged, in the tidal wave of
femininity. He was there against his will.
That afternoon and evening his plebiscite
was to be decided, and a Great Lady had
invited him to tea. There were votes
to be gained at the tea.
He swam through the waves of georg-
ette and crepe de Chine, climbed the stairs
and joined the tea-party on the balcony.
There he nibbled biscuits until the action
and his undershot jaw increased his like-
ness to a mouse. He flattered the Great
Lady, and echoed her abhorrence of 80l
shevism, Protective duties and disloyalty,
and drank tea with all-comers, and made a
little speech at the request of the hostess,
who was showing him off as though he
were a trick dog—although she merci-
fully omitted ordering him to roll over
and pretend to be dead, and did not ask
him to balance loaf-sugar on his nose.
At five o’clock it was all over. The
guests departed. The hostess said she
would collect her friends and insist on
their voting for Mr. Collopy, and Mr.
Collopy accompanied her to the hotel
door, and said “Good afternoon,” and
took off his hat like a well-brought-up
little man, and prepared to follow her.
The crowd from the Summergarden was
less dense. This discovered Mr. Collopy,
J.P., to a clean-shaven gentleman with a
hard face and high cheekbones and out-
standing ears, and a large mouth and a
chin as determinate as Mr. Collopy’s
wasn’t. His eyes laughed and his mouth
laughed, and there was such an air of
good humor about him that this ugly man
became good-looking.
He carried an alarm-clock ; carried it
obtrusively, waved it, thereby proving,
seeing that the time was but five o’clock,
that he was cheerfully drunk. Mr. Col-
lopy, J.P., saw him, moved to him
eagerly, clasped the hand free of the port-
able horologe and said —very heartily for
Mr. Collopy, J.P. :
“It’s Sandy; Sandy Morton!”
“For Gode’s sake,” said the man with
the alarm-clock, “it’s Wullie Collopy.
Wullie, ma wee mannie! Drink wi’ me,
Wullie!”
“I can’t really; 1 have a meeting.
Another time.”
Morton regarded him still affection-
ately, but with sorrow —a look that hurt
Mr. Collopy. Small and selfish and narrow
as he was, this friendship was all he had
known and clung to. For Morton had
been a fourth engineer oh the ship which
brought Mr. Collopy to Australia, and
which had therefore been kinder to him
than father and mother could ever be ;
and he and Morton were then both in the
early twenties, and in their mere unlikc-
ness had found something to mutually
like.
Morton, now chief engineer of an
oversea tramp, had made friends almost
every day since then, but Mr. Collopy
had never made another close enough to
warm him ; and he loved this friend of
his youth.
He wanted to follow that plebiscite to
the end, and he hated the Caravanserai,
but he hated leaving Morton.
“Ye’ll come, Wullie Collopy ; ye'll
come,” said Morton, laughing all over
himself. “An’ I’ll show ye ma bonnie
alarrum-clock, that I bought because 1
was drunk.”
“But, Sandy, I can’t; it’s important.
The plebiscite for the constituency is held
to-day. I have strong opposition and
want every vote I can get. And if I stay
with you I’ll lose a lot.”
Morton regarded him more reproach-
fully. “Wad ye leave yeer frien’ for a
dom wee Parleyment, wad ye? Yeer
frien’ Sandy Morton that ye came to this
country wi’ in the old Cambyses forrty
years agone. Wad ye?”
And Willie Collopy, seeing reproach in
the eyes of his one friend, felt that he
couldn’t, although he knew that he
would. Apparently he agreed that he
would never abandon Sandy Morton
while Sandy Morton wanted him ; but
mentally he compromised with himself.
He decided to stay only a little time —
a very little time —to soften the blow of
the abandonment that must be. So he
assured Sandy Morton that he would not
leave him, and Sandy Morton’s cheerful-
ness became uproarious*. He ordered
whisky, and more whisky ; and Mr. Col-
lopy, with friendly desire to join the fes-
tivities, had one glass of port wine and
made it last three rounds, browsing on
it and drinking it very gradually in the
manner of a real lady. Morton did not
sip. yet liquor did not relax his vigilance.
At last Mr. Collopy said he must go to
his meeting. Morton replied that he
would go, too. He would take no denial
—he felt his presence necessary for the
winning of the True Cause —the true
cause being that of his friend for the
time being.
Collopy agreeing to the inevitable,
Morton passed out of the bar of the
Caravanserai into the hall, laughing still
and loudly addressing the world on the
matter of his wee alarrum-clock, which
he insisted on winding jup.
“Leave it, Sandy,” said Mr. Collopy.
“You’ll be winding it up too early.”
“I’ll do naething of the sorrt!” replied
Morton, suddenly rebellious, “an’ ye’ll
just wait a bit, ma wee mannie, while I
wind the alarrum so I’ll not oversleep the
morrn.”
He had become more Scotch with the
drinking of it, and as he became more
Scotch he became more public. Collopy
agonised while his one friend slowly
wound the alarm and placed it in a huge
coat-pocket, wherein it ticked loudly.
The clock-winding ended, Morton con-
sented to proceed, and Mr. Collopy
steered him southerly in the Street of
Magic, stressing storm-signals at all the
ports of Scotch and Soda Morton tried
to enter, seating the friend of his youth
on a Bellevue Hill tram as the Post Office
clock chimed half-past five.
Morton dozed as the car sped up Eliza-
beth-street and ran round its sixty curves,
through Paddington and Woollahra. The
clock still ticked and Morton still
breathed. Besides these, Collopy was the
only sign of life in the rearmost seat of
the car.
They stopped with a jerk directly
opposite the little hall where Mr. Col-
lopy’s immediate political fate was being
decided.
There were waiting before the hall
many of Mr. Collopy’s supporters, mostly

Australia has a substantial and steadily growing
trade with the Pacific Islands and it was in order to
foster and stimulate this trade that the Bank of
New South Wales established its branches in Fiji,
Papua and in the Mandated Territory of New
Guinea.
These branches, in addition to providing banking
facilities essential for the development of the terri-
tories in which they are established, furnish the
credits and make the financial arrangements necess-
ary for the shipment of Australian-made goods
to the islands and of island produce to Australia.
These island branches are in direct communication
with the other 700 branches of the Bank.

women, and very many of the supporters
of Mr. Collopy’s opponent, Mr. Chesters ;
and they were all women.
Morton, still drowsy, attempted to
leave the tram, and fell out of it.
He regarded his downfall as an excel-
lent joke. He roared in appreciation of it.
Mr. Collopy towed him inside, and
Sandy became sentimental. He swore
that his friend Wullie Collopy was the
best friend that any man had ever known.
The wretched candidate, seeing his
chances of selection slipping, vainly en-
deavored to stifle the well-meaning
mariner. He knew well enough that only
the soft answer would suit Morton’s case,
and that Morton, crossed in friendship,
would turn upon and rend him publicly.
So Mr. Collopy soothed and coaxed
and temporised and placated, until the
women, who had regarded him with
horror, reflected from their appreciation
of Morton as a man utterly lost, began
to see in him one so naturally benignant
that he could be kind without motive or
reward.
“Now, Sandy,” said Mr. Collopy, “you
mustn’t fall down. Hold on to me,
Sandy, i’m your friend, ain’t I, Sandy?”
“Ye’re ma on’y frien’—ma dear frien’,
Wullie Collopy,” replied Morton, almost
tearfully. “An’ ye’re the best man ever
wore breeks.”
He raised his voice for the edification
of a wider audience. “I tell ye, leddies,”
Morton continued, “there’s no better man
than Wullie Collopy. I met him forrty year
agone on the old Cambyses. Iron screw
steamer, nine hun’red tons burthen, Bristol
to Sydney, an’ I was fourth engineer. An’
what I thocht him then I find him the
day; wunnerful, glorious an’ grreat.
There’s no mon for me but Wullie Col-
lopy. He” —r-
He was answered immediately by an
adherent of the opposition, a lady who
belonged only on the fringe of Bellevue
Hill and who therefore had not the real
Bellevue repose, even in moments of elec-
tion stress. This lady, objecting to the
intoxicated stranger’s eulogy of Mr. Col-
lopy, J.P., vigorously cried:
“Three cheers for Mr. Chesters....
Hip, hip, hip,”
Morton finished it for her:
“I-addy I ay, I ay,
“Hip-I-addy I ay.”
At that precise moment the alarm-clock
—set too early for next day and now per-;
forming twelve hours before the time in-
tended —rang loudly from the depths of
Mr. Morton's pocket. To the unhappy
Mr. Collopy it sounded like a firebeli.
To Morton it was but another phase of
that everlasting joke the world, and all
that therein is.
He turned to the few women who were
likely to vote for Mr. Collopy and to the
many adherents of Mr. Chesters, and
laughed, while he attempted to talk, too.
“Ya, ha!” laughed Sandy Morton. “I
came to see the wee plebiscitey an’ ma
dom alarrum-clock has gone daft in ma
pocket. Ya, ha! Ya, ha!”
The women thawed before that irresist-
ible grin and laughed with him.
Mr. Collopy, unhappiest of men, know-
ing that ridicule meant defeat, took
courage from despair and forced the
laughing Morton down the street to the
next tram-stop.
They boarded the first car, and Mr.
Collopy fled from his Waterloo.
* * * *
“I won,” said the dazed Mr. Collopy.
“You say / won. But when I left the
hall the last reports were that I had been
defeated badly.”
The Great Lady explained. “Your
kindness to that poor intoxicated friend
won a lot of votes ; and then they liked
him, too.”
“Liked him? Liked Morton?” re-
peated Mr. Collopy, unwilling to believe
that his virtuous life had availed less than
the sins of the ribald friend. “Liked
him ? But why?”
“Because he laughed so much and
made them laugh, too.”
“Nae fear,” said Morton, in replying
to his friend’s vote of thanks. “ ’Twas
ma alarrum-clock that saved ye as the
fulish geese saved Rom’. An’ yumman
naitchure loves the mannie that makes it
grin.”
The Art of Fishing.
BY J. B. BLAIR.
THERE are few places where it is not
practised. Briefly, these places fall
under three headings.
(1) Places where there is no water. For
example, the Sahara, Gobi, Kalihari,
Arabian, Great Sandy and Wilfrid
deserts, Alice Springs, Charlotte Waters
and the proposed new City Baths.
(2) Places where there is water, but it
is not fit for piscatorial consumption.
E.g.: Dead Sea... .too salt. River Yarra
....too sweet. Blue Lake....too deep.
Lake George.... too casual. Niagara
Falls.. . .too restless. North P01e... .too
solid.
(3) Places where there are both water
and fish, but where there is nobody to
fish. Such are the ocean below the
hundred-fathom mark, goldfish ponds
and undiscovered lakes and rivers in un-
inhabited regions.
Thus the field of activity for the would-
be fisherman is limited to no particular
locality. With the exception of the places
mentioned he may go almost anywhere
and fish to his heart’s content, provided
he has (a) the necessary knowledge of the
craft, ( b ) the necessary apparatus, (c) his
liberty, ( a nd) a license, and (e) beer. Pro-
vided also (/) he puts back all fish under
a certain size, and ( g ) does not die of
hunger, exhaustion or old age before he
has caught sufficient to induce the state
of contentment.
Fishermen are divided into two major
classes —those who fish for a living and
those who live for fishing. The former,
the professional class, never ply their
trade in fine weather; they remain at
home mending their nets and caulking
their boats and waiting for storms to
arise. Their wives keep their huts neat
and clean, knit comforters and socks for
their men and sing sad songs of their
fathers, brothers and sons who are asleep
in the deep. Their children, however,
are quite carefree. “O well for the
fisherman’s boy, who laughs with his
sister at play.”
It is a happy picture, the everyday
scene at a fishing village. Big Tom and
Uncle Abner caulking and uncaulking
their frail boat. Tom’s wife busy knit-
ting a navy jersey. Aunt Emily scrubbing
the kitchen floor. Seventeen children
playing on the shore. Some are Tom’s,
some Abner’s. Their shrieks of childish
laughter are pleasing to the ear. They
are playing a game called “Bringing in
the bodies.”
Aunt Emily joins the group by the
boat. “Why don’t you go out to-night
while the weather’s fine?” she asks. Big
Tom shakes his head and points to the
sky. “The wind’s in the east,” he replies,
“and, besides, we can't go out till the
moon’s at the full.”
Abner nods assent.
Contrast the scene a week later. The
waves are breaking furiously on the
shore. The wind howls. The sky is dark,
except when it is momentarily lit up by
jagged forked lightning. The rain is
teeming down as though it will never
stop. Tom and Abner, enveloped in oil-
skins, so that you can’t even see Tom’s
new jersey, are about to push off in their
frail dory. Their wives are clinging to
them, beseeching them to stay, careless of
the drenching rain which soaks them to
the skin. At the cabin window, dimly
lit by an oil lamp, can be seen the chil-
dren, the whole seventeen of them,
huddled together, frightened and silent.
“Don’t go,” pleads Aunt Emily, cling-
ing to Abner. “Wait till to-morrow ; it
will be finer then. Nothing could live' in
a storm like this.”
Abner shakes his head and glances at
Big Tom.
“No,” says Tom, “we must go to-night.
The wind’s in the nor’-west and the
moon’s at the full. A fisherman must
go, whether there’s danger or not.”
In vain does his wife point out that
the wind seems to be blowing from all
points of the compass at once. In vain
does Aunt Emily protest that the moon,
full or otherwise, hasn’t been visible for
two days and two nights. It is useless.
The storm is at its worst; therefore they
must go forth. Why? Well, because they
are fishermen, and their fathers went
forth thus before them, and their fathers
before them, and so on. So they push
off their boat in company with forty or
fifty others, and their wives repair to the;
lighthouse tower, and the undertaker
drives over to the next village to transact
some business with the carpenter.
Sad scenes such as this might be
avoided by compelling all professional
fishermen to remain bachelors. But there
would then be no one to sit up in the
lighthouse tower to tend the light as the
sun went down —except, of course, the
official lighthouse keepers, who are all
very well in fine weather but absolutely
useless when there’s a storm about.
Another insuperable obstacle is that
after the first generation of bachelors had
been wiped out in the first two or three
storms, there would be no one to take
their place, as fishermen must be sons,
grandsons and great-grandsons of fisher-
men. We can picture a broken-hearted
old woman smiling through her tears as
Tom and Abner are carried in. “They

“but thank God I’ve given them all to
the sea.”
The literature to which we are in-
debted for our knowledge of the fisher-
folk tells us little of their actual labors.
They are always either going out in the
teeth of the storm or being washed
ashore ; but presumably there are times
when they outwit the storm and bring
back fish. Such occasions are probably
rare, but they must occur sometimes, as
it is unbelievable that fishing communi-
ties could carry on for generations simply
by clubbing together to pay each other’s
funeral expenses. Moreover, it is an in-
disputable fact that fish are from time to
time exposed for sale in shop-windows,
and they are even occasionally actually
served up in various shapes and forms
at the better-class hotels ; so it is evident
that someone must have caught them.
Now, since the professional fisherman,
the man who fishes because he must,
seems to be a creature of such elemen-
tary intelligence, what manner of man
must the amateur be, who fishes because
he likes it —who, having all the pastimes
and occupations of the modern world to
choose from, forsakes them all and
cleaves only unto this? What is the chief
difference between them?
Take Big Tom and Augustus Stickle-
back and compare them man for man.
]n stature and outward appearance they
differ considerably; but look deeper.
Examine their intelligence, their conver-
sation, their likes and dislikes, their be-
liefs and superstitions. They are the
same man! The only difference is that
Tom calls himself a fisherman, and
Augustus likes to be styled an angler.
True, Tom goes forth in his boat with
nets, while Augustus uses but rod and
line ; but these are differences of tech-
nique only, and carry no weight in the
final analysis.
Consider other aspects.
Augustus has decided to go fly-
fishing on Saturday afternoon. When
lunchtime arrives, there is a steady
drizzle of rain, and a bleak east wind is
blowing. Mrs. Stickleback suggests that
he forego the expedition and stay home
to listen to the radio; but Augustus
climbs into his old tweeds and gets ready
his fishing kit.
“They’ll be rising well to-day,” he
observes.
“Don’t go to-day,” pleads his wife.
“Wait till to-morrow ; it’ll be finer then.
You’ll catch your death o’ cold going
out in this weather. And remember how
your father used to suffer with rheu-
matism.”
“Nonsense,” replies Augustus. “It’s
just the weather for fishing. And it
wasn’t rheumatism ; it was gout.”
Late in the evening he returns, wet to
the skin, proudly displaying five small
trout. “Jones only got three,” he an-
nounces triumphantly (sneeze). “Calls
himself an angler (sneeze). But I showed
him a few points. And you should have
seen the one that got away from me, over
in Pike’s Creek (violent sneeze). Must
have been four pound if it was an
ounce.”
“Yes, dear,” replies Mrs. Stickleback.
“Now just pull those wet things off and
have a nice hot bath and get into bed,
and I’ll bring you a nice supper. Steak
and eggs.”
“0.K.,” says Stickleback; “but you
should have seen” (violent sneeze)
Stickleback probably lives much longer
than Big Tom. Medical science can
sometimes cope with sneezing and rheu-
matism, but it can’t do much for a man
who has been drowned for two or three
days. A drowned man is so unresponsive.
Sometimes Stickleback may be tempted
to leave the trout alone awhile and try
his hand at saltwater fish. With three
or four companions he will sit for hours
in a small boat baiting his hook, casting
out and hauling in.
If he is lucky he will ascribe his
success to his knowledge of the type of
bait appreciated by the fish that fre-
quent the particular vicinity, or to his
having selected a hook of the exact size,
and so on.
If he catches nothing, and his com-
panions are more fortunate, then he ig-
nores the present and talks of the big
cod he caught in the Murray last Easter,
or, more likely still, says he never could
see anything in this type of fishing. “Give
me a running stream with a few lively
trout,” he’ll say. “That’s what I call
sport.”
The manner of man best fitted to be-
come a fisherman must possess that
indomitable strength of purpose which
alone will allow him to venture forth
into stormy seas or cold trout streams.
The professional fisherman can probably
get along with this one attribute alone.
The amateur, however, must possess
many other qualities. He must have
patience, and a tongue which can be silent
for hours on end but which is yet cap-
able of holding its own at the Anglers’
Club. A long pair of arms is also handy.
A member with short arms never gets
far in the Anglers’ Club, and it is doubt-
ful whether there has ever been such a
thing as a one-armed angler. Finally,
an angler must have a vivid and an alert
imagination, as it takes a ready wit to
cap on the spur of the moment a tale
which a fellow-member has probably
been thinking out all the week.
The question of bait deserves some
mention. Even the most adventurous
fish cannot be expected to snap at an
empty hook, just through a desire to see
the upper world. Trout are more or less
an educated and conservative type of
fish, and would die of old age rather
than be caught with anything but the
orthodox fly ; but I doubt whether the
average saltwater fish can tell the differ-
ence between a worm and a slice of his
second cousin. In any case, once he is
caught it doesn’t matter whether he was
caught on cray or caviare. But the
angler imagines it does. “Yes,” he will
boast proudly, “two dozen and five this
afternoon —on squid, too.”
The only justification for the angler is
that if his efforts are rewarded he is
able to supply his family, and possibly
some of his friends, with fish for the
table. No such justification can be
claimed by American novelists, who
spend weeks angling for 10001 b. fish and
hauling them ashore with cranes and
grapnels amid the plaudits of the press
photographers. It is an old saying that
“There are bigger fish in the sea than
ever came out of it.” My own opinion
is that there are bigger fish out of the
sea than ever went into it.
It would be useless to attempt to offer
advice to a person contemplating becom-
ing a fisherman. One may offer advice
to would-be engine-drivers, bee-farmers
or gold-beaters, to those about to be
operated on for appendicitis or intending
to join the navy or proposing to get mar-
ried. There- are scores of textbooks
offering Hints to Young Stamp-collec-
tors, Big-game Hunters and even Young
Mothers ; but similar books for young
fishermen would be wasted. In the first
place fishermen are born, not made, and
no person who is not born a fisherman
ever has the slightest desire to become
one. Then no right-thinking fisherman
would dream of taking any notice of
such volumes. He prefers to face the
storm with the moon at the full because
his father’s father did so, or to drop
his anchor at the Norma wreck because
a few good snapper were caught there
in ’O3.
Any advice from me would be worse
than useless. I am not a fisherman.
The Almond-tree.
Shake out anew your fluttering flight of blossom,
Old almond-tree!
The while the sunlight kisses earth’s cold bosom
Inconstantly.
Lead forth again your flocks of delicate flower.
Like roseate foam,
Thinking, because a sunburst cleaves the shower,
The spring comes home.
Old almond-tree, marred with the long years’
story,
The winds’ long wars,
Beauty herself has laid a wreath of glory
Above your scars!
For that you deem, in spite of frozen shower
And flying wrack,
That spring returns Even so my heart
would flower
If Love came back.

The Upland Road.
I stand upon an upland road
That winds and wanders down
From timbered ridge and rocky bluff
To lowland farm and town.
Afar and nigh in ordered squares,
Green pastured fields among,
My eyes behold dark orange groves
With golden fruitage hung.
Between sown flats that, marrow-fat,
Lie stretched on either side,
I see, lit by the morning sun,
A river, bright and wide.
With here a vineyard, there a space
Where lush the lucerne grows,
Benign, beneficent it winds—
Life-giving as it flows.
While yet an early breeze, dew-wet,
Creeps gently o’er the land,
I see by busy milking-yards
Cud-chewing cattle stand.
I hear a boy with greeting song
Salute the day new-born —
His voice the happy voice of youth,
His joy the joy of morn.
And now, roused by his jubilance
To fresh and sudden song,
A thousand bushland birds give voice
To rapture, clear and strong.
Beneath, above, down hill and up,
In leafy haunts, wind-stirred,
High sings the magpie, high the thrush,
And high the butcher-bird.
To join with them in grateful thanks
For joy and grace bestowed,
Right glad am I to greet the morn
Upon this upland road.

Beware of so-called “cheap” imported lamps which may
(
cost a few pence less to buy, but which add shillings
to your lighting bill. Insist on Australian-made, and
look for the name “PHILIPS” on every lamp you buy.
