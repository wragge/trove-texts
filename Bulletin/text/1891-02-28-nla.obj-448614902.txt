-1. To establish an Irrigation Colony at
To purchase and acquire the rights and
piuvneges o» the promoters, aussrs. George Chaffey and Henry Gorman, granted under the Act of
Par lament called tlm Mulgoa Irrigation Act. This Act was passed by the Parliament of New South
Wales iu December, 1890, and enables and authorises Messrs. George Chaffey and Henry Gorman
“to establish a system of irrigation and water mpply within and adjacent to the police district of
Penrith, to acquire lands to establish irrigation works, to authorise the sale and supply of water for
irrigation and domestic use, and to construct, make, and lay dams, weirs, or floodgates upon or across
the Nepean and Warragamba Rivers, and for. all other purposes which may belncidental thereto ’’
And 3. To exercise the rights under the provisional contracts made by the promoters or on their behalf
with the owners of the lands proposed to be irrigated, and which are set forth hereunder
The estates which in the first instance it is proposed to form into an Irrigation Colony (the first
in New South Wales), consisting of rich, fruit-growing, horticultural lands, suitable for the growth of
oranges, lemons, apricots, peaches, nectarines, vines, &c., in area about 20.(100 acres in all situated in
the County of Cumberland, 30 miles or thereabouts from Sydney, in the parishes of Muffioa Clare-
mont, Melville, and Rooty Hill, and extending to within a mile of the railway station of the pro-
sperous town of Penrith, and adjoining St. Mary’s on the Great Western Line of Railway form the
key to the whole country round MulgoA. These can be irrigated from the'Nepean and Warragamba
Rivers, and it is proposed to sell these lands in blocks of 5 and 10 acres and upwards, with water rights
attached. The actual cost of the land will be under £l2 per acre, and the time required for can-yin"
out the works so as to commence supplying water it is estimated will be within nine months 'The
promoters confidently expect that these blocks, with the water rights, will realise a profit of from i°s
to £5O per acre.
The genuineness of this enterprise and tiie practical skill of the Messrs.; Chaffey (the head of
rm, Mr. George. Chaffey, C.E., will be the consulting engineer) are sufficient guarantees tin
reat creative work, the first in New South Wales, will bo carried out in a profitable way. and

Messrs. Chaffey Brothers Uaie successfully established irrigation colonies at Etiwanda and
Ontario, in California, where the lands improved by the growth of vineyards, orange and lemon
groves, &c., have been sold at from £250 to £;s00 per acre.
Messrs. Chaffey Brothers have also successfully established, and are profitably developing on a
scale commensurate with the magnitude of the enterprise, the irrigation colonies of Mildura (in Vic-
toria, 500 miles from Melbourne) and Reninark (in South Australia, 250 miles from Adelaide)
The Vendors have agreed to transfer to the Company the valuable concessions privileges and
rights referred to, for the sum of £25,000, and 125,000 shares fully paid up; they have, however ’such
faith in the enterprise that they have agreed not to transfer 100,000 of the shares for a period of’three
years from the incorporation of the Company.

| Dr. M. PESEHUT,
M.E.C.S., L.S.A , &c.,
SPECIALIST for the Treatment of Nervous
Complaints, Diabetes, Tumors, &c.
Registered by the Medical Board of N-S.W. Late House Sur-
geon to the Great Northern Hospital. London.
1 am aware that I am not strictly following thd paths
of professional etiquette by advertising myself as a
Specialist for the treatment of this class of disease, but,
unfortunately for the suffering public in Australia, the
apathy shown by Qualified lien in the treatment of
Chronic nml Nervous Complaints has induced men of the
lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unlimited assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promises trap the unwary.
It is very evident that sufferers from these diseases
have been scandalously treated by these unqualified
. persons The evidence taken at the Medical Enquiry
hold in Sydnev (published in the Daily Telegraph, Nov.
6th 7th and Bth. 189(1) plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in which patients are duped. Not only are
they robbed of their money, but what is of infinitely
greater importance, their health is injured also. It is
therefore time that legally Qualified lieu entered the
field to fight these pests of society with their own
weapons, viz., Advertising,
It is utterly impossible for thofee who are suffering
from the-e diseases, who are scattered over all parts of
Australasia, to ascertain which Qualified Practitioner
makes these diseases hfs speciality unless he advertises.
I consider therefore, that by advertising I not only
strike a blow at the Quackery which now exists, but I also add
to the usefulness of my profession and in no way lessen my
personal dignity.
Jlv Qualifications I invito the fullest investigation into. For some considerable time I was House Surgeon to the
Great Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of or serving the >nany phases of the Nervous and
Siexua- System, and to become acquainted with the most scientific methods ot etieoting their cure. •
My sole attention is given to the treatment of these diseases, and when a person
commencement whether I can effect his cure or not. The patient is not deluded with false and specious piomise.., and
if I undertake the case
I Absolutely Guarantee a Complete and Permanent Cure.
My great success in the treatment of these diseases enables me to give this guarantee without fear.

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1891.
The Annexation of Australia.
In a recent issue of the United Service
Magazine there is published a lengthy
article, by an obscure British major-general
and an equally obscure major, on the general
weakness and defencelessness of Australia ;
and the writers conclude by deducing the
customary moral that the Australian nation
must continue to put its faith in the stunted
soldier and the narrow-chested officer who
is grown in England. In these two under-
sized objects clad in glaring red lies the sole
hope and trust of this continent, and should
the colonies cast them away they will per-
form an act of reckless insanity compared to
which the spectacle of Moses throwing away
the Ten Commandments was too trivial to be
worth mentioning. There is nothing new or
original about these statements ; in fact they
are strangely suggestive of that old acquaint-
ance, the “dull thud” which accompanies the
report of every modern execution, for it al-
ways seems that we have heard the same story
somewhere before; but in the present case the
major and the major-general speak from ex-
{lerience and personal observation. They
lave both visited Australia, and they report
it to be at once the richest and the most
defencelesslandon earth—a country which has
neither an army nor a navy, which is devoid
of arsenals, and provided with no adequate
fortifications, and not even supplied with
sufficient ammunition to last through the
first week of a campaign conducted on
modern principles. And, above all, the
major-general has noticed, and the major
backs him up on this point, as usual, that the
inhabitants are an infatuated nation who,
because they have never seen war, are
fondly persuaded that they can defend them-
selves against any Power now in existence—
a race who mistake their gunboat for an
ironclad, and fancy that one man drawn up
in a hollow square is an army, and who
imagine that their country is the greatest
in all the globe because they know
nothing about any other. And as the
Hottentot chief with his army of 480
spearmen, and the Ashantee with his old
rusted musket, and many others like them
have entertained the same ideas, and been
afterwards undeceived, so the major-general
—duly propped up by the major—holds that
Australia will some day be subjected to a
rude awakening if she lets go her hold upon
the Empire, and tries to sail by herself on
the troubled sea of national existence. For
in that case the major and the major-general
both recognise that this continent will be
instantly annexed by swine of the grasping
Powers of Europe, and turned into a Herman
province, or a Russian principality, or possi-
bly something even worse than either.
* * •
The bogey of inevitable annexation is an
instrument which the Imperial party in
Australia has employed for many years, and
though the spectre is threadbare and very
hoary, it still does considerable service. It
is based on a general understanding that
somewhere or other there lurks an unspeci-
fied enemy of great dimensions, whose one
ambition is the conquest of Australia, and
that in some way not described Britain has
hitherto scared away this undefinable an-
tagonist. Who the antagonist is, and why
he should have failed to develope himself by
the conquest of various other countries that
are quite as defenceless as these lands, is
not explained; neither has it ever been
revealed why Australia should be so entirely
dependent upon British support, when at
least twenty little Republics, each much
weaker than this continent, have maintained
their independence for many years withoutany
such extraneous assistance—and any faith in
Imperialism depends merely upon the bald
and unsupported statement that the Aus-
tralian nation must hang on to Britain or
sink into eternal wreck. Yet among the
commonwealths of South America—all of
which hold their own against the outside
world with reasonable success—Chili and
Brazil are the only ones which, in a fighting
capacity, can be said to stand on the same level
as Australia, and Peru, Paraguay, Venezuela,
Bolivia, Ecuador, and Guatemala form the
successive gradations of a descending scale,
whose end is reachedin the tiny State of Costa
Rica, which could not possibly maintain a
military contest against Parramatta with a
reasonable amount of success. And each of
these States has not only to face the grasp-
ing Powers of Europe—the same Powers
who are to bring about our immediate
destruction when Britain’s grandmotherly
supervision is withdrawn from the scene—
but it has also to defend itself against its
own immediate neighbours ; and, despite all
these disadvantages, no French squadron has
yet overwhelmed Callao, neither has the
devouring Russian laid his unclean hand on
the city of the Vale of Paradise. In fact,
the race of European conquerors have as a
rule studiously avoided all unnecessaxy
quarrels with these little commonwealths,
and unless the fact that Chili and Peru have
not been annexed is to be taken as evidence
that Australia will be instantly devoured
without cause of offence or possibility of
resistance, the only possible conclusion is
that the undefined enemy who is to descend
upon Sydney is a hollow lie, and that
Britain has no more real cause to protect
Australia than she has to lend a helping
hand to Saturn.
* * •
The drivel about British protection has,
in fact, become part of the Australian’s very
existence, and but for this he would long
ago have perceived that his country is
already better protected than Britain itself,
and that, with the single exception of
Russia, no State in all Europe is so invul-
nerable as this continent. The “bloated
armaments” loom very large on the far
horizon, but they are too cumbersome, and
the ironclads are too ponderous and top-
heavy to be dangerous to any enemy lying
outside a comparatively narrow circle.
France and Germany, with two million
soldiers apiece, find it is exceedingly diffi-
cult to provide even 30,000 men for service
at the other side of the globe, and Britain,
with the largest fleet on the ocean, could
barely find and transport 25,000 soldiers
and sailors so far as Alexandria. The
reason why the comparatively feeble
States of South America retain their
independence unquestioned is that, despite
their weakness, they are too strong
to be attacked with impunity. Chili
or Paraguay, standing on the defensive, with
the wide ocean to hamper the movements of
her assailant, is more than a match even for
Germany, and the armies which took Paris
could not permanently hold Valparaiso or
Aussuncion. The great military nations of
the o>d World are an exceedingly hollow
race of giants at the best, and they are ten
times less fitted for distant conquests than
they were in the days before steam was in-
vented, and when standing armies were un-
known and the magazine rifle was undreamt
off. If Australia lay in the Mediterranean
she would be crushed like an egg-shell by
even such second-rate Powers as Spain or
the Ottoman Empire ; lying in the Pacific
Ocean she is almost as safe from conquest as
Sirius or the Pole-star itself.
• • #
Europe, in fact, has learned by melan-
choly experience to know her own impo-
tence. When America commenced her war
of independence, with a population smaller
than that of Australia, and without arms,
arsenals, or fortifications, England entered
on the contest with a light heart ; and it
was only after seven years of victories which
brought no results, and weary marches which
had no visible purpose, that she realised
that the contest was as endless and as hope-
less as a combat between the condor and
the whale. The struggle which followed in
1814 only emphasised this conclusion : the
veterans who defeated Ney in the Penin-
sula were as powerless to subdue America as
to scale the walls of Paradise. The attempted
conquest of La Plata, and the ignomin-
ious surrender of the entire British army
to the Spanish militia at Buenos Ayres,
furnished another proof that great dis-
tances are a stronger defence than
great armies. And finally the unspeak-
able collapse of the great scheme of Napo-
leon 111. for the establishment of an empire
in Mexico—the long, pitiless struggle in
which the Mexicans slowly ground Bazainr’s
magnificent army into small dust —and the
closing tragedy when the - Franco-Austrian
Emperor was shot as a common criminal at
Queretero, finally convinced Europe that
distant wars, except against the feeblest and
least civilised of enemies, are speculations
which pay no dividends, except in disaster.
The stories of New .Orleans, of Buenos
Ayres, and of Queretero are . the best com-
mentaries upon the alleged defencelessness
of Australia. The Australian may or may
not prove himself a good soldier —lie may be
even superior to the Briton or the indomit-
able Russian, or he may develope into some-
thing akin to the slipshod warrior of Central
America ; but until the Pacific dries up and
the Indian Ocean is baled out his country
requires no British suzerain to save it from
annexation,
* * #
Every year, as the armies of Europe
expand and the ironclads grow larger and
more ominous of aspect, the danger of
invasion diminishes. The old sailing vessel
—the floating wooden fortress of a century
ago—was a thing to be dreaded by even the
most distant enemy ; but the armour-plated
monster of to-day is almost useless, except
for purposes of home defence. The former
was comparatively cheap, and thus a great
naval state could then muster some 600 avail-
able vessels, while now a vastly increased
outlay can barely keep 60 ready for service.
It conveyed nothing save provisions, am-
munition, and fighting-men, and conse-
quently any second-rate kingdom could
collect ships enough, at the shortest notice,
to transport a powerful army to the other
end of the globe if requited. But in these
days of iron and steam everything has
undergone a revolution. The modern man-
of-war is loaded down with coals and
machinery, and can barely hold half
the complement of seamen carried by its
predecessor of a hundred years ago. It can-
not even undertake a voyage from the Cape
of Good Hope to Australia unless there is a
certainty of fresh fuel on arrival, and its
ammunition is so ponderous, and its carrying
capacity so limited, that the largest fleet
which any European nation could send into
Australian waters might exhaust its entire
stock of missiles without really wrecking
a single city. The average ironclad, too, is
only able to enter the largest and the most
accessible of harbours ; it is utterly incap-
able of accommodating troops, so that re-
garded as a basis for land operations
it might as well be non-existent, while
the ordinary steam transport, being equally
dependent on constant supplies of coal, is
equally powerless when these are cut off on
a hostile coast; and under sail it is little
better than a log upon the surface of the
water. And, in addition to all this, the
floating castles which encumber the seas
have never yet undergone any serious trial
in actual warfare, but their awful collapse in
many a much-blundered autumn manoeuvre
makes it more than doubtful if a fleet
directed against a far-off land would not
break down by its own weight and inherent
incapacity before it had even begun to do
any serious damage.
• * #
The defences of this country are neither
its alleged fortifications, nor its self-bursting
guns, nor its hired left-off generals, all of
which are vain things and of little account,
nor does it rely on the so-called protection
of Britain, which was recently compelled to
protect itself by importing Asiatic soldiers
into Europe. But it can depend safely on
its size and upon its inaccessibility, upon
the utter helplessness of these nations
which are called in irony the six
Great Powers when they attempt to make
war outside a certain narrow radius, and
on the fact that the much-advertised enemy,
of whose desire to annex this country so
much has been heard, has never yet turned
up, nor seems likely to do so. It rests upon
the consciousness that 1000 leagues of open
sea is a stronger bulwark than 100,000 armed
men, and that two oceans are a more reliable
rampart than the two largest armies to be
found anywhere on this earth. And if the
Australian’s blind confidence in his as yet
untried abilities leads him to under-estimate
a possible opponent, he can at least console
himself with the reflection that if he proves
no better a soldier than the Mexican troopers
who followed Juarez, or the Argentine
militia of Buenos Ayres, he will still be
equal to the defence of his native land with
the advantages which Nature has furnished
for his assistance ; and if he should chance
to possess all the energy of that other branch
of the Anglo-Saxon family which broke up
the Anglo-German army on a certain memor-
able occasion at Saratoga, he will be the
better able to dispense with that British
protection which is so often heard of
and yet is so exceedingly invisible. And,
in any case, he is willing to follow the
example which has been set with tolerable
success —so far as safety from annexation is
concerned—by the ten republics of South
America, and, like them, lie will probably
pull through somehow. If Australia has
no fortifications worth mentioning it can
at least derive comfort from the re-
flection that England has practically no
fortifications at all, and seems none the
worse for the deficiency. If it be virtually
without a military force, there is consolation
in the knowledge that the countries witli no
standing armies have got on much better of
late than those which possess these cumber-
some adjuncts—that Samoa held its own
against Germany much more successfully
than France, and that Madagascar, the
Transvaal and Abyssinia have among them
inflicted a humiliating smash upon three of
the alleged great Powers. And concerning
its want of arsenals, and munitions of war
and other appliances, the ancient Afghan
musket and the Zulu spear and various im-
plements of an equally primitive kind seem
to have asserted themselves to considerable
advantage of late against all the expensive
weapons of Europe, and the clay walls of
Plevna, with 25,000 soldiers behind them,
proved a much better defence than the
gigantic ramparts of Paris with a quarter of
a million defenders, and a certain armed
pig-boat with one gun, which, the Chilians
sent to sea during the late war with Peru,
made a woeful, exhibition of sundry iron-
clads which cost nearly their weight in gold,
and Osman Digna appears somehow to be a
more valuable means of defence than the
most elaborate major-general who ever
published a vast mass of wasted theory
either in the United Service Magazine or
in any other publication. For the great art
of war is only a toss up after all, and even a
major-general knows not what a day may
bring forth.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
That Shearing Row.
Up in the dim and sultry North, where the sky
is brass and the earth is red-hot iron—in the
scorched and shrivelled land of sin where a
blood-stained race has arisen that s-joeaks dis-
respectfully of Capital—a terrible civil war is
now raging—in the newspapers. The angry
shearer has got up like a demon and stopped
work, and he is loosely pervading the face of
the earth, and if he isn’t suppressed it is under-
stood that anarchy will shortly break out.
Therefore the Press that howls in the interests
of the employers, is full of large print and
shrieking capitals, and a sort of vague impres-
sion prevails that blood and brains and bowels
are ilying in the air; and there is the yell of
loud artillery somewhere —in theory, and the
groans of the dying who are writing to the
daily papers, and the screams of the dead who
are telegraphing to the Courier and the
Sydney Morning Herald and the Arcus.
And somewhere, on. some unspecified battle-
field, where the heroic special constable died
with his eye fixed on the serined ranks of
the insurrectionary shearer, that hero is still
festering and drawing up reports about the dis-
turbed state of the country, and from the bottle
and jug department of the hotel can be heard
the roar of the red sea of war ; and the squatter
whose scalp has been torn off by the ensanguined
foe, is fighting in the ranks of death in a
mutilated condition, and with no hair on the
top of his brain. Or if these things haven’t
happened already they are evidently going to
happen, judging from the unearthly row —-in the
papers —so they may as well be mentioned in
advance. What has occurred, so far, is that
several union shearers .are wandering about in
the wilderness, partly in search of work and
partly for the purpose of arguing with stray
blacklegs, and when two men get drunk and
fight in a bush pub. it is telegraphed as a
ferocious onslaught on a squatter, combined
with an attempt to burn down his premises and
fry him and ids family in the ruins. Also,
when a revolutionary army of two swagmen
advances in hostile array to ask for a feed they
are multiplied into a hundred armed men on
horseback bent on an errand of massacre, for
now that the alleged insurrection is said to have
commenced it is necessary to find something to
support the theory and keep the tragedy going.
Further, when nobody appears at all, and there
is nothing in sight, it is a sure sign that the
union men propose to set all the dry grass in
flames all over Queensland, because it then
becomes evident that they are too darkly and
desperately inoffensive to last, and as a stern
warning not to do it again, constables are
promptly despatched to the place where
the disaster seems likely to happen because
it hasn’t yet taken place. But, up to
date, there have been rather fewer fires than
are usual in that combustible land —only in
ordinary years, when ten conflagrations take
place, they are set down to the fact that Queens-
land in the summer is as inflammable as muslin
in Hades, whereas this year—because some
fool has raised an ignominious scare—one single
blaze is sufficient evidence of murderous in-
cendiarism, revolution, anarchy, wholesale and
retail homicide, and sedition. Also there has
been just about the usual amount of violence,
only violence, in other times, is merely a row
between two drunks, while now a row between
two drunks is insurrection ; and the number of
men who are travelling round in a threatening
manner is about the same as before ; but then
a man who was travelling used to be called a
swagsman, whereas now he is called an armed
unionist disturbing the peace of the country.
Consequently, by much vociferous telegraphy,
something has been got up—in theory—that is
either an insurrection or an art union for
religious purposes, and apart from the row
created by the police and the Government and
the capitalistic press it is about as much like
one as the other. The unions have apparently
used a certain amount of strong language—’
about one-half as strong as the language that is
read out in church every Sunday—and that is
the beginning and middle and end of the whole
proceeding.
Griffith on Labour.
In Queensland, as in every other part of the
world, labourers are numerous and employment
is dismally scarce, and, consequently, the un-
employed workman has begun to enter a pro-
test against the fatuous immigration policy,
under which every effort is made to bring
more workmen to a land where they seem to be
already much too plentiful. Being stranded
himself, with no prospect of a job, it seems like
wild sarcasm that he should have to pay for the
importation of strangers as “dead broke ” as
himself, and help to supply them with a homo
w hich he is much in want of for his own use,


and fttrnish an “immigration agent” to hunt
up employment for them, thereby making it all
the more difficult to get employment for him-
self. And, moreover, he has been instructed
that his wages—when he has any —are kept low
by the immutable law of demand and supply,
which is a thing fixed by Providence and not to
be fooled with by common mortals, and, there-
fore, he wants to know why the Government
should violently interfere with that law to his
disadvantage by producing an artificial supply
for which there is no demand whatever. The
other day a deputation waited on Premier
Griffith to draw his attention to these and
other anomalies, and that alleged democrat
boiled over with righteous indignation after the
following manner: —
The Premier replied that the immigrants did not com-
pete with the men in towns. Moreover, there was plenty
of work in the country, but men refused to leave the
towns. He had a report from the immigration agent
that Willcocks and Firth, a firm of railway contractors,
required 50 or 60 men at 7s. 6d. to 9s. a day. After some
difficulty the immigration agent was only able to engage
12, of whom four eventually refused to go. The Premier
then referred to a recent case where a number of men
sent to Gran’s sugar plantations, in the Bundaberg dis-
trict, left after one day’s work without explanation,
although the wages apparently were satisfactory.
This is the same old wheeze that has been used
up over and over again till the world has grown
weary and disgusted. When work is unob-
tainable, and wages are nil, and food is non est,
the indignant capitalist, and the politician who
grovels to the capitalist, always rise to point
out that somewhere a long distance away there
is abundant employment, and wages are so high
that the labourer is liable to break his back
getting his salary home on Saturday night;
only, with the inherent cussedness of his tribe,
he won’t go there. There is invariably a Job
waiting on the top of an inaccessible mountain
somewhere, and £1 a day can be made without
the slightest difficulty ; or else there is a con-
tract in the centre of an unapproachable swamp,
and the pay is half-a-crown an hour ; or out in
the middle of the great Sahara there is a rumour
of a situation at an immense sum paid weekly ?
and when 800 able-bodied men are out of work
it invariably happens that some sympathising
patriot like Griffith is on hand to curse
wildly because he has heard at second hand
that two men are wanted 1800 miles away,
and why don’t they all go there and be
content ? And when a demand suddenly arises
in some uninhabited district, where there never
was any industry before, for a man to do half-
an hour’s constant employment, and that situa-
tion isn’t filled on the instant, then somebody
of the Griffith order invariably gets up to
point out that the “unemployed” never will
accept work when it is offered. No doubt it is
rough on “a firm of railway contractors” who
suddenly want 60 men in some empty wilderness
and can’t get them, but the population is thin, and
distances are long, and probably there are only
ten regular male inhabitants in the place, and
if 60 men had been loafing about waiting till a
“ firm of railway contractors ” wanted them
they would have starved long since, or been
committed by some bush J.P. for vagrancy.
The man who suddenly wanted a barrister on
the top of Mount Kosciusko would probably
fail to get one, though Australia is absolutely
swamped with barristers, and an unexpected
demand for six clerks and a draper’s assistant
on the coast of Torres Straits might find the
market empty, and yet no one, sane or lunatic,
would suggest a wholesale importation of clerks
and drapers from Europe to fill a yawning-
void in the paths of industry. Yet if, any-
where between Thargomindah and the Swan
River, a labourer is wanted to shift some bricks
for a precarious remuneration of sixpence, and
no labourer appears on the horizon, it is resolved
at once that nothing but immigration on a large
scale can prevent the bloated toiler bringing
Australia to ruin. If a man is not there when
the capitalist wants him, then the labouring
classes in general are merely loafers and
agitators, and if he is there when the capitalist
does not want him, ho- is run in for having no
visible means of support.
An Impotent Samaritan.
This is another fizzle from Premier Griffith’s
recent blast on the labour problem :
The position taken up by the labour party was that no
man should work unless he belonged to a union, and no
man must work for less than a certain scale of wages.
Supposing a minimum of £2 per week, there were many
men in the community who could not earn more than
half that amount. Those men would be perfectly willing
to take what wages they could get so long as they could
keep themselves.’ Quite recently a number of men applied
to he sent to the Dunwioh Benevolent Asylum, as they
could not earn minimum wages, and of course could not
get employment, though willing to work for what they
could get.
It would be interesting to know if Premier
Griffith —who has actually the fire-proof
effrontery and incombustible cheek to describe
himself as a Socialist—really believes there is
any working man in the community whose
labour is worth less than £2 a week, and if he
does believe so the world would be glad to know
where his stock of old horse-sense has gone to.
And as he objects to the attempt of the unions
to fix a miuimun wage of 405., it would gratify
a good many people to know what the legal
Samuel regards as a reasonable limit. It is
true that there are many men who cannot
“ earn ” that amount, as the term is used
by the modern capitalist, but then that
proves nothing ; the nigger who used to
work on the Carolina plantations toiled
all his life and never “ earned ” a cent
beyond his rags and his exceedingly scanty
board, for the sufficient reason that his em-
ployer was in a position to make him work
gratis, and in more recent days there are plenty
of white men who do not, and never will,
“ earn ” 40s. a week, or even 205., though they
produce probably ten times that amount,
because their employer has got a chance to
snavel all the rest. If the unions do not fix a
minimum wage then they must leave things to
be settled by the Law of Competition—which
means that the minimum will be simply the
amount which the cheapest man in the com-
munity will take, so that someone else may
starve instead of him ; and in that case there
will bo no such thing as unionism, for every-
body will lie left to scramble for himself. The
business of unionism is to keep wages up, but
Premier Gur i iTir, the alleged friend of union-
ism in all its branches, is indignant, after the
manner of many other hollow democrats,
because the principle for which he howls in
theory is being turned into practice. And with
regard to the “number of men” who are not
allowed to work for £1 or 255. a week, their
position no doubt looks lamentable enough, and
yet what Griffith wails over is simply the
dismal fact that certain individuals are not en-
couraged and assisted to take, at 205., the work
which is now' being done at 405., thereby
depriving some other persons of a job for their
own benefit, and qualifying some other “un-
employed ” for a place in the Benevolent
Asylum instead of themselves. The work
which they could do is, no doubt, being done
by someone else at the present moment, but
Griffith’s yearning to assist the impoverished
toiler, apparently consists simply of a yearning
to put every man in a position to undersell his
neighbour, and to shunt out someone else by
taking his job at a lower rate, without any
consideration for the man who is shunted. And
for a man who travels on his sympathy for
Labour, this is about the thinnest kind of
sympathy on record. The men -who are
“willing to work for what they can get” are
merely men who, under modern conditions, are
willing to do another man’s work for less than
the other man has got, and let the other man
take his turn at starving—only, unhappily,
when wages have been lowered to facilitate
this exchange, the sympathy of philanthropists
like Griffith will be concentrated on the other
men, and wages will be lowered again to let
them shunt the men whom Griffith had pre-
viously assisted to shunt them, and so on ad
infinitum.

“ The Scotch System.”
Shocked by the ridiculous collapse of the
Premier Building Association farce, a Melbourne
gentleman has, in all apparent innocence, peti-
tioned the Victorian Government to adopt the
Scotch system of procedure in criminal cases,
and his verdant screed has been handed to Mr.
Shiels for consideration. The gentleman
points to what he regards as a peculiar advan-
tage of the Scotch system in dealing with cases
like that which was recently dropped down the
sink-hole of official oblivion, viz. ; “All criminal
prosecutions are undertaken by the Crown, and
conducted by officers with permanent salaries.”
There is no occasion to go further into the
question of Scotch law in its possible bearings
upon the P.B.A. business. Had the Crown
been free to follow the devices of its own heart
it would have declined to prosecute anybody
upon any sort of charge, and even Mirams and
Doherty would now be flitting around as free
as the fowls of the air. Unless, therefore, we
assume that those two unfortunates are wrong-
fully convicted, it is very obvious that the
Scotch system might, under certain conditions,
suit the Crown’s private feelings and interests a
good deal better than it suited the interests and
feelings of the public at largo. The Crown, as
this Melbourne gentleman seems to forget, may
be a small collection of benevolent male per-
sons (mostly bald-headed) whose faith in the
integrity of themselves, their relations, and old
friends, is impervious to the insinuations of a
wicked outside world. There are prosecutions
in which actual members of the “Crown”
must be included before the Law can hope to
get at certain other parties, and recent experi-
ence tells us that such prosecutions would
seldom or never disturb the minds of Australian
provinces under the Scotch system. Mr. J. L.
Dow being practically a portion of the Crown,
when he was summoned to appear at Melbourne
City Court, the worthy Gillies burst forth
with a protestation of belief in his colleague’s
innocence. In the face of that fact, who can
imagine the possibility of Gillies having ini-
tiated proceedings fraught with inevitable dis*-
comfort to the Crown ? Again, assuming that
Gillies had been a director of the P.8.A.,
would he have voluntarily run himself into the
dock, knowing all the while that he, as the
brightest jewel of the local Crown, had done,
would do, and could do no wrong ? The more
me thinks over the Scotch system (which
Shiels is now considering) the more one can see
why Shiels has been asked to consider it by
his Premier Munro. For Munro sits upon the
boards of many building and financial societies,
and no society, however sound at the moment,
can tell what the future, or another secretary,
may have in store for it. So long as tough,
uncompromising official liquidators have the
discretionary power of prosecuting leading
politicians for mere negligence, there
will always be a chance of another P.B.A.
scandal. Under the Scotch mode of procedure
such a scandal would either escape the notice of
the Crown, or, at the worst, be sympathetically
investigated by “ officers with permanent
salaries.” Then The Bulletin would be pub-
lishing more “ Tales of the System.”
Always rely upon your capitalistic, com-
mercially-conducted newspaper to adhere to its
own sickening class distinctions. From Sydney
D.T.’s phantasmagoria! account of the Queens-
land shearing trouble (our italics): —
A gentleman from Belyando, who passed through
Capeila camp yesterday .... says the shearers are
a most ruffianly-looking lot, a great number being gaol-
birds. What such men may do, or to what extremes they
may proceed, time alone will tell.
The lies in the above are self-evident to all who
know the Queensland shearer. The fact is that
the gentleman (if he ever existed) was a cad and
a cur of the final degree of unwholesomeness,
and if the shearing trouble would but result in
the sweeping into Limbo of all such carrion, it
would be better than any general gaol-delivery
that ever happened in the busiest days of Judge
Lynch.

Jingo J. B, Patterson, the latest apostate to
Toryism, has just introduced the Australian
Yellow Pup to an audience at Newcastle-on-
Tyne, and has denounced Irish Home Rule as
“ nothing less than veiled rebellion.” The ex
Castlemaine butcher, whose past records pro-
vide varied reading for the envious, and whose
proud boast it is that he has piled together
wealth “ sufficient for the rest ftp Ids life,” owes
no small part of his financial success to the
hypocrisy with which he bamboozled the masses
into believing him a radical democrat. He
made most of his money as an official politician.
Like his first leader, Berry, he is now a Tory
tumble-bug, and spends his time in venting
adulations on the classes who were the objects
of his former invectives, and in squirming in
grovel for royal favours. The blatant butcher,
moreover, has not even the radical virtue of
originality, but is found imitating the language
of another Imperialistic parasite, Sir John
Macdonald, who has just declared that any
desire on the part of the Canadians to regulate
their own tariff with their neighbours on terms
advantageous to each, is “ veiled treason.”
Jingo Patterson curiously enough argues that
the possession of autonomous government makes
Australians “ loyal”—his meaning being
“ loyal to Hingland ” and not “ loyal to Aus-
tralia.” His conclusion, therefore, that “Irish
Home Rule is veiled rebellion ” is in direct con-
tradiction of his own arguments. But that is
a small matter to a title-seeking butcher.

The bloated pretentiousness of the wholesale
“rag” trade in Australia has been again ex-
posed by a failure (two failures, in fact) and the
‘ ‘ home ” market is sniffing suspiciously at the
mention of these beastly Kawlinies, and abusing
our Calico Jimmies for all they are worth,
which, in many cases, is far less than the out-
side world imagines. It is about time that the
soft-goods “houses ” —especially that collection
of dreary edifices in Flinders Lane, Melbourne —
left off pretending to do a gigantic business and
retired into smaller premises and a cheap,
obscure quarter of the town. The very term
‘ ‘ wholesale ” has but a sneerful application to
the commerce of Skite, Blow & Cos., whose
annual turnover is not much more than half
that of several adjacent retail drapers, and
whose weak financial condition is, or was, in-
dicated by the existence of a “ combination
list a solemn agreement by which each
“great house” binds itself to sell certain goods
at the same prices as the other great houses
all the while that some low, “cutting” shop is
offering them for less. As conveniences for
country storekeepers, and small traders in
general, the stupid old wholesale houses have
their use, although they are responsible for the
deplorable increase in the number of petti-
fogging suburban shops, into which they shoot
their rubbish, just as brewers buy up small
pubs, in order to dispose of bad beer. As
autocrats of the trade, however, the Jimmies
(still speaking particularly of Melbourne) are
as dead as herrings, and a good job, too. The
indenting-agent, living on the spot, is a better
kind of middleman in every way than the
Flinders Lane “ firm,” which spends its profits
in London, employs too many active young
men in loafing about too big a warehouse, pays
long prices for goods because it wants long
credit, and concludes a played-out career by
going fearfully bung.
An inspired paragraph in the Sydney daily
press tells us that “ there is a peculiar interest
in the visit of Premier Pabkes to Gladesville
Asylum, because under his administration while
Colonial Secretary in 1866 such institutions
were placed on an entirely new basis, and an
end put to the practice of treating their inmates
as so many dangerous prisoners. ” It makes us
smile. There is a peculiar interest in every-
thing under Heaven because Parkes did it all.
The moon has a peculiar fascination for us
because Parkes has frequently looked upon it.
The earth has a peculiar interest to us because
Sir Henry Parkes, G.0.M.G., walked upon it
and owned some of it—which he sold to a man
named M'Namara at North Shore, Sydney, as
many people still remember. The New South
Wales Education Act has a peculiar interest
because good old man Parkes cribbed it from
the Victorian Act —and spoilt his plunder in a
clumsy attempt at cobbling. The New South
Wales Local Government Act has a peculiar
interest for us because good old Sir Henry
Parkes didn’t accomplish the same after poli-
tically travelling upon the promise of it for
over 20 years. The people of New South Wales
have a peculiar interest for ns because they are
such darned fools as to have been humbugged
by good old Sir Henry Parkes for over a
quarter of a century.
Asa matter of law—though perhaps not of
police-beak law—the Goddabd-Choynski fight
was most assuredly a prize-fight in the strictest
sense of the term. The legality or illegality of
these exhibitions has never yet been decided by
the New South Wales Supreme Court, which,
The Bulletin ventures to say, would on the
evidence available unhesitatingly declare these
slugging matches to be just as illegal as the
typical early - morning raw-meat-and-grass
encounters of the long ago. The Bulletin is
neither so senseless nor so hypocritical as to
decry slugging matches while such atrocities as
the lashing of madmen for obviously “mad”
offences takes place in the Hogging-yards of the
Australian gaols with the full approval of the
very same godly bourgeoisie which is so dread-
fully shocked when the bleeding Mr. Goddard
gets another clout on the jaw and Mr. Choyn-
ski has his lip split with a “ stinging right-
hander.” But The Bulletin is deeply inter-
ested in seeing that powerful and wealthy
Sydney cliques shall not have the privilege of
using the criminal law as an engine against
their enemies and competitors and of openly
breaking that same criminal law in their own
sordid interests—all of which is undoubtedly
now being done. For example, one gang is per-
mitted to run these unadulterated prize-fights ;
the gate-money revenues whereof are enormous,
and to thereby find the coin for big prizes to
keep the game going ; yet, if a couple of pugi-
lists outside the pale and patronage ot this
influential combination had a set-to without
the farce of gloves for “a tenner and a belly-
full,” they would be instantly run in by the
energetic policeman. Another powerful gang,
while making thousands out of race-consulta-
tions, incite the prosecution of the totalisator-
man, and succeed in extinguishing him in the
interests of themselves and the bookmakers.
In order that the legality of thinly-veiled prize-
fights may be definitively set at rest, let a prose-
cution be started against Choynskt and God-
dard for engaging in their recent bruising-
match, and let the Club-officials, Captain
Fisher, S.M., Postmaster-General O’Connor,
and so on be indited as accessories. Then lei
such evidence be tendered in favour of the con-
tention that the affair was a prize-fight and
nothing else, as was given in the papers which
reported the details of the fight, and let the
case be taken on appeal right up to the Full
Court. Anybody who wants to wager on the
result after such a prosecution has been started
in real earnest has only to call round at The
Bulletin office.
The Messageries Maritimes Company’s
splendid new 7000-ton steamer, Polynesien, ran
from Noumea to Sydney in 65| hours, or at the
rate of 17.1 knots an hour right through. On those
figures she is the fastest vessel in these waters.
England has now 100,000 officially-certi-
fied lunatics. Last year there were 2500 deaths
from suicide. Suicide within a generation has
increased 35 per cent, and nervous diseases 50 per
cent. .
The Bulletin firmly believes that Judge
Windeyer’s opinion in the case of Dr. Macleod,
now appealing against his sentence for bigamy,
will be upheld by the Privy Council against the
decision of the majority of the N.S. Wales Full
Court.
The Melbourne police have got a very
nasty knock from the jury which found Oswald
Twist, charged with having set fire to the Palace
Hotel, not guilty, and added a rider that “ undue
influence has been raised to procure evidence
against the accused.”
A Melbourne comic paper wears this motto
on the front page : “ There is something in the
distresses of our best friends that is not altogether
displeasing to us.” Consequently, we presume, a
fellow naturally incites his best friend to harrow
himself up by buying that paper, and this innate
malignity keeps the circulation going.
A bashful individual whose retiring nature
will undoubtedly wreck all his earthly prospects,
is suing the Daventry (Eng.) bench of justices for
£500,000 damages. We don’t know the particulars
of the case, but we trust he may get a verdict.
To see any average bench of J’s P. let in for
£500,000, or even more, would be a refreshing
spectacle.
A French gentleman has introduced the
latest novelty in suicides. After soaking his
clothes in paraffin oil and padding himself out
with boxes of matches and bunches of kindling
wood, he strolled into the church of St. Michel,
Havre, and took measures to catch alight as he
knelt at prayer. By the time the priest had got
the conflagration under, there was not much
French -gentleman left to burn.
Sentence passed on Ivan Posoulski, who
escaped twice from Siberia, the last time after
killing both bis guards : Ivan Posoulski is to be
again transported to Siberia. On arriving there—
where he is to pass the remainder of bis life —he
will receive 200 strokes from the knout. He will
always be chained, and will have to drag after
him an iron ball weighing 201 b. More than this,
his chains will be riveted to the cart which be will
have to draw. After which, for the ensuing 20
years, he wifi be treated as a dangerous felon, and
be compelled to fast several times a week.
Davison Dalziel, whose news-agency is
now “knocking spots’’off the British Press Asso-
ciation and Central News, is the ingenious young
man who started the Sydney Echo, which he was
artful enough to well to John Fairfax, who never
ceased to lament his bargain. Dalziel is one of
those irrepressible men who cannot be kept under.
His journalistic ventures have mostly failed, but
he still “bobs up serenely.” It will bo remem-
bered that he married “Dicky ” Lingard. On dit
he meditates establishing an opposition to Reuter
in Adelaide, and would like to secure Philip
Mennell’s services as manager. Mennell visits
Australia as special correspondent for the Daily
Chronicle, to report the proceedings of the
Federation Conference.
While British Columbians and Canadians
and Yankee skippers are doing their best to kill
the goose that lays the golden eggs by the indis-
criminate slaughter of young and breeding seals
in Alaskan waters, there springs a ray of hope out
of the darkness from that as yet unknown quan-
tity in geographical and piscatorial terras—the
South Pole. It is said that there are as large and
important seal rookeries in the neighbourhood of
Kerguelen’s Land as any around Behring Sea,
and that they only need to be explored to have
their value appreciated and known. All that is
known of the regions around the South Pole is
that, some fifty years ago, the British Government
vessels, Erebus and Terror, did their best to cir-
cumnavigate and arrive at .suoli details as they
could, regarding a lofty line of ice stretching for
thousands of miles and impeding passage, some-
where about twenty degrees of latitude from the
Pole itself. A few charts about this expedition
were published, but the facts were so shadowy
and unreliable that none but a few of the more
progressive or visionary geographers cared to
define these regions in their maps. Now, how-
ever, things are assuming quite another shape.
There is no question as to the existence of im-
mense and valuable seal and whale fisheries
within Australian reach, and the Antarctic waters
are as near to Australia as Baffin’s Bay is to
England.

846 Macqnarie-street North, Sydney, Feb, 25,1891.
My Dear Moorabikda, —
Society is beginning to be afraid that the Jersey
will be more philanthropic than festive, with a greater
leaning to orphans and tea-meetings than dinners and
balls. lam told, by the way, that the responses of the
congregation to whom the Earl read the “lessons” at
Sutton Forest church, the other Sunday, were most im-
pressive. If an Earl pawed about in a pulpit and gave
out the doctrines of Mahomet the worshippers would be
there and full of child-like faith all the same.
Lady Jersey evidently doesn’t yet understand the
difference between here and ’Ome, or else she would not
aave coldly replied to the welcoming address of the Moss
i ale Public School Children that she hoped the youngsters
would “always look clean and healthy.” Now, Lady
Carington would kiss some of the prettiest little girls on
such occasions, but I am told Lady J. surveyed them as if
they were a mass of small beings whom one is obliged to
tolerate, my dear, but who really ought to be taught to
pull their forelocks.
Whatever may happen now Lady J. is here, it xca*
remarked that the Earl isn’t so effusive to a übiquitous
newspaper-lady as she always is to him. It was only a
little while ago that, as the vice-regal steam-ship left the
wharf heading for the flag-ship, this irrepressible person
pelted on to the scene a moment late and waved an in.
dignant umbrella at the steamer to come back and pick
her up. But the launch steamed merrily on its way, and
she was left to follow fuming in a wherry.
Local mammas who, in a wild burst of worship chris-
tened their poppets “Myee,” are as sorry as they can be
now that Lady Jersey is on the scene, followed by the
ladies Margaret, Mary and Beatrice ; and the exuberant
creature who baptised a red, spongy sonny, “ Charles
Carington,” is trying to figure out if she could gently
alter it to Arthur George Child Viliiers without exciting
comment. That is the worst of vice-regal adoration—the
idols change too often, and before Lady So-and-So is even
aware that a freckly, snub-nosed brat has been sprinkled
in her honor, she fades on the horizon and all is over.
How would a sliding baptism meet the case ? “I christen
this infant ‘ Lily Carington Jones’ to be subsequently
altered if the parents see fit.”
I read that the Countess of Jersey is “ the great lady of
Oxford, and while the Earl is a clever man, he lacks the
ambition and intense mental and physical energy that
distinguish his wife." It was very probably she who
“signed articles” for Australia (I think the lady should
always have most say since she is the head and front of
vice-regal administration in the “ kawlinies ”), and her
motive was social ambition. It is believed that the
dreary exile of the Jerseys will pan out into amarquisate,
so to speak, when all the horrors of crowded “at homes ,r
and vulgar receptions will be forgotten as the Marchioness
of Jersey steams out to dinner-ahead of some overbearing
creature whose train she is only privileged to follow as
matters now stand.
The N.S.W. Horticultural Society’s display of summer
flowers and fruits made a mouth-watering show in the
Centennial Hall on ISth inst. There were great stands of
cool ferns, banks of flowers (the dahlias being the prize-
specimens) and big fruit; though the egg-plums, the
apples and the pears were not up to Tasmanian standards.
The three decorated dinner-tables were the usual tangle
of undergrowth, with nowhere to put your plate, the
second prize (by Miss Payne, an amateur competing with
professionals), in pink and cream roses and ferns, being
the most possible design to get your food amongst without
catching any of the verdure on your fork. A funereal
set-out of white wreaths and crosses on a coffin-trestle-
only wanted a name-plate to resemble the casket of “not
lost, but gone before,” and the big prize-basket looked
like a deranged hair-broom.
Many people attended on opening-day, and some—only
some—of the dressing was notable. Mrs. Durdekin (the
Mayoress) did the show with Mr. Fuller from Government
House (who was a really beautiful sight in wide white
continuations and no waistcoat), Miss Blomfield, and
Commander Allen. Mrs. Burdekin wore a cool, white
dress, with a neck-scarf of pale-yellow chiffon, a plate
hat of fawn straw, trimmed with blow-aways and yellow-
chiffon ; brown tulle veil, and a fawn chiffon parasol. Miss
Blomfield sported a simple gown of blue designed cambric
and white embroidered yoke, pink chiffon neck-scarf, and
fiat black hat trimmed w ith pink dazzler. Pretty Mrs.
Haviland Reynolds (wife of the secretary) wore a black
corded silk gown with jet about it, and a small bonne!
w'ith heliotrope-velvet strings. Another nice dress was a
fine white muslin, with beautifully-worked bodice and
corselet of embroidery, and basque of fine lace, the plain
skirt finished with lace flounces. Equally dainty was an
electric-grey soft silk with cuffs, Swiss beet and collar of
black lace, and grey chiffon frills in the front, small black
crownless bonnet of black jet and aigrettes. And a large
golden-haired matron in a lovely fresco wore purple in
every shade, and had a devoted \outh in her pocket; and
the prettiest woman there had nothing on to speak of
but a hat wifi crimson feathers.
There was quite a flutter at the last meeting of the-
Ladies' Sanitary Association in the Mayor’s room, the
other day, when it was discovered that a man with a
pencil was present at what was meant to be a confidential
conference. As he had a pencil, and all societies like an
advertisement, they allowed him to stay, but the business
Of the meeting was sadly “put up,” and many an abrupt
pause was made and many a sentence was left to be com-
pleted by the listener, because in the presence of Mrs.
Boffin it was better to drop it. At last the meeting
seemed to come to a close, and the “belle” of the
assembly stored up his notes and rose to go. As he
reached the door the President observed in a stage-
whisper that there was just one little matter she wished
to speak upon privately, and the recording angel made a
blushful break into the open air. Then the meeting put
its bonnets together and talked for another hour or two.
It is interesting to learn, through the late Sydney
School of Arts dispute in re charging the omnivorous
lady-reader the same subscription-fee as her husband or
brother, that “ ladies who brought the institute fifteen
shillings per year cost more than the male members
because they read more novels and give more work to the
bookbinders.” Women do treat books very cavalierly.
For one-ihing, they are so frightened to have to exercise
their memory to find the place, that they leave a book
flat on the face or swelled with a thick “marker”—for
which the most handy thing is utilised—a paper-knife
being favourite. Then their propensity for using a book
as a weapon of defence or offence keeps the bookbinder
on the skip, not to mention their trick of hauling a book-
strap round and round until the cover is bent like a bow.
I am told there is a growing discontent among the
“lady-readers” at the “harmless” nature of the
literary bill-of-fare served up at five shillings a quarter-
A calm-eyed maiden asked plaintively for one of Zola’s
raciest tomes the other day, and wasn’t a bit nonplussed
when the good young man who hands them out replied
severely that “no books of an immoral character were
allowed on the shelves."
Apropos to Sydney School of Arts, I am told that since
females other than “the wives and sisters of members”
have been permitted to sip its literary delights, the roll
has been augmented by several of those beautiful crea-
tures whose cheeks are always pink and who wear out
their old silk dresses in the morning. And the odd part
about it is that while the sober-faced matron in the for-
bidding bonnet generally goes in regularly for Ouida
the butterflies ask demurely for Maria Edgeworth and
A.L.O.E. ! Yet it isn’t surprising. It you transpose the
fine, old ’omestead proverb about “what the eye doesn’t
see the heart does not hanker after” you will have a
tolerably good reason for it, don’t you think ?
Somebody, signing “Discontented Mermaid,” writes to
the papers on the subject of a bath “ for ladies only,” and
grumbles over the fact that at Sydney Natatorium women
have but one evening in the week in which to disport
themselves in the briny. She pleads her case very tear-
fully, but in my humble opinion one evening in seven is
quite enough for the darlings, whose behaviour in the
vicinity of the dip is reminiscent of the old lady who
advised her daughter to hang her clothes on a blackberry
bush, but not to go near the water. Your Sappho
attended a “ ladies’night ” recently. There were tribes
of nymphs about, attired in strange though modest cos-
tumes, from the good old bathing-gown in which the
sprightliest girHooks like Aunt Sally to a neat little turn-
out like a navy-blue jersey with legs added on, and most
of the time was spent by the dears in perching round the
edge of the tank with their knees drawn up to their chins.
Sometimes one venturesome beauty would drop in with
a shriek, and then the crowd would jabber like the Zoo,
and “ My, isn’t it cold !” or “ O-o-oh ! I believe there’s an
octopus got in 1” would come from the heads bobbing
about in the water, upon which the perchers would draw
their knees still higher and some of the more nervous
would make an absolutely dry break for the dressing-
rooms. There was one notable exception, though, with a
curly brown crop like a boy, and a bathing-suit of grey
and cardinal, who dived and floated, and struck out and
pulled many a white ankle as it hung over the edge until
the owner toppled in with a squeal, and was the life and
soul of the bath ; but she, poor dear, got the cramps and
was last heard of from under a hot blanket.
As a general rule women don't care for such a crude
proceeding as getting salt-water down their ears, and
their hair out of curl, and a rose-bath is more to their
cat-like taste than the joys of the tank, a cheap recipe for
which—the rose-bath, not the tank —is herewith set forth:
Soften the water (either warm or cold) with one small
handful of fine oatmeal, to which add half a pint of
glycerine and two drops of attar of roses (but not the
cheap and nasty attar you buy from Indians), and there
you are ! This bath is not for cleansing only, for after
you have dried yourself on a coarse towel used d la mas-
sage, you will find that the skin is seftened and the per-
fume blended into each line of the body. It doesn’t cost
much, either ; only those who try it with a spurious attar
will have to empty half-a-bottle in instead of two drops o
the Simon Pure.
The Wesleyan troubles at Tonga are a past thrill for
everybody but Miss Beatrice Baker, a daughter of lion.
Shirley Baker, who is now a confirmed spinal invalid.
The story of how she became so is rather unusual in this
egotistical age, when every woman is for Herself. She was
driving with her father when she saw a native raise a gun to
take deliberate aim at Shirley, when, quick as thought, she
threw herself in front of the barrel and received a bullet-
wound. She didn’t scream or faint, hut told her father it
■was “ nothing." When the doctor saw her dress soaked
in blood late in the evening the truth came out. Some-
thing had “ set in ” by that time, however, and now, poor
girl, she is an invalid for life.
I wonder why it is that all women are so deplorably
■“uppish?” It is their crying failing-from the ex-
corner-puhlio-house iady who goaded “ William ” on to
the 'listings, to the autocrat of the kitchen who goes to
the same dressmaker as the Missus. If all the world
were a tailors’ paradise, peopled only witli men, there
would he no smiles and sneers and withering glares—men
sire a homely, simple-minded race who hardly ever put on
frills except at feminine instigation ; else, why are there
so many wifely winks and hints and kicks in the pre-
tentious miSnage lo prevent the innocent master of the
Bouse from blithely giving the whole sham away? It is
the working-man’s wife who wears kid gloves while the
“ old man ” clings to moleskins, and it is she who apes
terrace “ manners ” while he continues to hitch his belt
mud cut his meat with a clasp-knife, while the leading
worry with the Australian Mary Ann is that nothing can
Toducc her to her place, and the fuel that the Jill
is as good as her mistress is responsible for the fluctuating
state of the labour-market. Which reminds your Sappho
that a Sydney matron “ sacked ” her housemaid the other
•day because she persisted in coming and going through
the front door though “ Back Entrance” was written as
large as life on the rear gale. In defence the disguised
-ducliess submitted that she was a lady, and that coinin’ in
the same way as the dust-boxes wasn't what she was
used ter. She goes in through the front door of the
Uegistry now.
It encourages those people who believe in the general
industry and virtue of the feminine community to learn that
the yearly report of Sydney Charity Organisation Society
shows that while 918 single men have been relieved, only
30 single women have come up to the soup and flannel
and catechism scratch. And the working young woman
who romantically designs to throw in her lot with James
on a screw’ of 30s. a week might remember in her calmer
moments that no fewer than 1428 Sydney married couples
subsisted on charity during 1890.
Apropos to the Coral strands, I am told that one of the
Consuls at Samoa (not to put too fine a point upon it) is
little better than Snazelle’s whistler who went to the
Alps to get over it. His conversation on the gravest
subjects is frequently interrupted by a long shrill whistle
more car-piercing than the toot of a tram-car, after
which explosion he goes on talking with the utmost
gravity while his listeners arc dying from corkcd-up
mirth. He is addicted to much gold lace and red-tape
dressing, too, and when ho has his cocked hat on and his
whistle in full blast, he is said to be more incongruously
entertaining than any parrot.
I hope the day has dawned when women—who generally
go upstairs like ducks in a hurry over rocky country,
treading on the front hem of their frocks and arriving at
the top purple in the face, an'd utterly done up—may
at least learn to do the thing in some sort of style. For
an enquiring she-sawbones has discovered that “by
going upstairs slowly with the foot—heel and toe alike—
put firmly on each stair, one may arrive at the top of four
flights of stairs really rested, &0., &c. Cut it is almost
like asking impossibilities to expect any woman to w alk
upstairs. I never heard a woman say she would walk
upstairs for anything, or even tell her servant to “ walk
upstairs and make the beds.” The verb “run” is in-
variably used, and even the staidest matron, when she
wishes to go aloft, takes a reef in her skirts and breaks
the record up the first flight.
Salvation ad. from S.M.H.:—
TyANTED the name and address of a godly young
' ’ MAN out of employment. Glorious, Herald.
Rut why doesn’t “Glorious” advertise in Adelaide?
There are any number of godly young men over there out
of employment—or there will be, when they come out of
gaol.
There is war to the knife in “ devout ” circles at Sutton
Forest and Moss Vale because Lord Jersey reads the
lessons at the first place, while Moss Vale has to put up
with a local bigwig who talks through his nose and isn’t
within coo-ee of an Earldom. And because of this Sutton
Forest is frilly, and Moss Vale is dying to square matters
by luring the Governor into their pulpit.
A moonlight picnic at Coogee the other evening was
greatly startled at about 9 o’clock by seeing dusky forms
gliding down the branches of a neighbouring tree. But
when they came safely to earth, they turned out to be
simply Angelina and her best beau, who had climbed up
there to spoon unobserved on the opossum plan. This
latest sentimental trick gives poor papa a chance. All he
has to do now is to “ moon ” his darling child, and then
shake the tree until she falls off.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
That old North Shore identity, Mr. G. M. Pitt, celebrated
his 79th birthday by a dinner to the members of his
family and a few intimates at his residence, “ Holbrook,”
North Shore, on 16th inst.
Mr. 11, K. Bloxham, who was struck off the dreary list
of J.P.’s by the NS. W. Government, ostensibly for “a
scurrilous attack on the Prince of Wales,” but really for
his violently-expressed sympathy with the union shearers
and his chat with a certain M.P., has resigned the shears
of the Central Australian and married a Miss Howard.
Mr. J. L. Parsons, who once before filled the editorial
chair, is his successor.
Mr. and Mrs. Robert Ross, of “Palmerston,” Waverley,
gave a most successful water party round the harbour on
21st. inst. to “warm” their new yacht, Canomie. About
40 sat down to lunch at the hotel at Watson’s Ray, and
amongst those present were Sir John Robertson, Mr. and
Mrs. Alhot and Miss Albot (Queensland), Captain and
Mrs. Fisher, Mr. Payne and Miss E. Payne, Mr. and Mrs.
Fairfax and the Messrs. Fairfax and many others.
Signora Fabris’ pupils’ concert at the Protestant Hail on
18th inst. was thronged with a complimentary crowd and
had the usual successful result. A presentation was
made to Signora Fabris of a basket of flowers and a purse
of sovereigns by Miss H. I.arnach on behalf of the pupils.
Sydney Agricultural Society hold a grand exhibition on
the Agricultural Grounds from the 25th to 31st March,
when the good old spectacle of the beautiful equestrienne
and the knock-kneed hack will be again to the fore. F.
W. Webster, Tattersall’s Buildings, is secretary.
Sydney society—or what there is of it in town—was
rather set back a few evenings ago when a leading family,
recently returned from Europe and supposed to be in
mourning for a near relative, fussed into a theatre attired
in all the colours of the rainbow. Weeds don’t prove woe,
of course, but still they are the only fashionable way of
looking sorry.
Sydney D.T. indignantly remarks that the
“personal safety (of the blackleg shearers) is only
guaranteed at a heavy cost to the Queensland tax-
payers by the presence of armed troops sent to
guard them from the attacks of armed unionists.”
Here is a small point, but it is as well to remember
it—these blacklegs are importations, and are not
“ Queensland taxpayers ” ; the “ armed unionists ”
are “Queensland taxpayers,” and, as such, con-
tribute towards the pay of the “armed troops
sent ” to assist the blacklegs to starve out or for-
cibly kill the unionists.
There will probably bo a field-day of
magnificent manoeuvring among the delegates
present at the opening of the Federation Conven-
tion, in order to ascertain who is self-sacrificing
enough to allow himself to be three-parts gagged
by accepting the dignified honor of President of
the Convention. Most of the delegates would like
to muzzle Parkes in this honorable way, but see-
ing that Sir Henry has no more titles to expect
unless Her Majesty makes him a Morganatic
Groom of the Royal Bedchamber, Colonial
Division, the H.O.M. is not likely—unless with
an eye to history—to greedily swallow the
bait. There are several alternative propositions.
The honor of the Chair is technically Munro’s,
since the Victorian Premier is the convener of the
Convention. Or, it is Sir S. W. Griffith’s, as
President of the existing Federal Council, which
the Convention intends to blot out. Or, it it is
Tasmanian Clarke’s, as he is understood to be an
obnoxious constitution-creator. Or, it is Premier
Playford’s, because he is the biggest man and can
nut out anything with his foot. Or, it is
“Righteous” Wrixon’s, because nobody wants
him in the Convention at all, and he is bursting
with special cram for the season. Or draw
lots, and let Providence (and the cleverest con-
juror) select the Jonah.

Grattan Riggs’ latest Sydney Royal
atrocity_ is named “Shin Fane,” but might as
appropriately have been named “ Shin Pone ” for
any apparent connection there is between the play
and its appellation. Entirely ■without motive,
and cramfull, like most of its genus, with invoca-
tions of the deity, it is one of the most disjointed
melodramas ever thrown together, but gives Mr.
Eiggs four different opportunities for the display
of his wonderful versatility and mastery over
varying Hibernian dialects, and therefore pleases
audiences who delight in colour and character.
The destruction of the oak in the ruin-scene by
the explosion of a meteoric stone, and the
death of the subordinate villain under its
falling limbs, is very well managed, but
probably the hit of the evening is made in the
emigrants’ cabin, appropriately situated under the
poop, wherein Grattan Riggs’ simulation of sea-
sickness, while spoon-feeding a baby, is so hideously
real as to send heaps of people out for brandy every
evening. The performance of Chas. Seagrave as
Shaun Rhua, a rugged ruffian, is a very good one;
Robert Inman and Richard Stewart, having
reversed their positions of former plays as villain
and virtuous man, seem scarcely so well situated,
and J. P. West as a weeping, doddering, old im-
becile is a perfect nightmare. M and Appleton plays
Molly Sullivan on the lines of her Arrah and is all
right, but should repress an irritating tendency
to bob her head while talking, after the manner of
Mrs. Potter and Nellie Stewart; Constance
Deorwyn is rather gushy as Ellen, and the Betsy
of Maggie Oliver is a clever little study. The
Grattan Riggs’ season concludes on Friday night,
when “The Yankee Farmer’’and “Handy Andy ”
will be played for his benefit. He then takes a.
tour through the country districts. Bland Holt
puts Sims and Pettit’s “ Master and Man ” up on
Saturday night.
** * *
“ Arrah-na-Pogue ” seems to be doing
good business at Her Majesty’s and is running
much more smoothly than on first night. It is
chock-full of realism, and the blushing bride is
now picked up from her cabin-door right down by
the footlights and whirled off at the O.P. wing,
followed by a howling mob of bhoys and girleens,
barefooted children, and blind men, to be set
down, after the front cloth is raised, at the back-
door right up stage. But the event of the show,
nevertheless, is Maggie Moore’s pathetic and fiery
rendering of the “Wearing of the Green,” with
the dramatic support rendered, vocally and histri-
onically, by the carefully-drilled supernumeraries.
George Rignold, who “knows how to touch the
pathetic stop,” seems to have given up his struggle
with the Irish language as a hopeless task, but
Harry Jewett has managed to swallow the leek
and retain the potato in his cheek. “Jim ” Haz-
litt is a lovely Major Coffin, but “our Mary Ann”
dees not seem to have gripped the assertiveness of
Katty Walsh. It is said that “My Jack” is in
rehearsal, but as that tale of the sea and Sahara
was played to death here a little over twelve
months ago, this is probably a foundationless
rumour. George Rignold, we learn, is far from
well, and Jewett has understudied Shaun, Ayrton,
Feeney, in case of accidents. Why don’t they
give Charles Burford a show ?
** * *
‘‘The Jilt,” not having much to contend
against, is doing good business at the Criterion.
Last week wo omitted to make mention of the
admirable performance of Mrs. Brough as Kitty
Woodstock, the cash-laden, love-sick lady who
successfully woos the punctilious and penniless
O’Hara, journalist and jockey. Her marching
and counter-marching with Pattie Brown, how-
ever, in the marquee scene lacks spontaneity, and
with bo’h performers the whole business is too
evidently a matter of six steps up stage, three to
right or left, and six down. A revival of “The
Squire” will follow, date uncertain, and “School”'
may take the place of Pinero’s play.
** * *
There is still money in “ Maritana,” that
is evident, for, despite the break-down of Charles
Turner—who has been singing in a I’ll-get-that-
note-or-bust style—and his replacement by Percy
Shannon (who acquitted himself creditably during
two nights), Sydney Garrick has done excellent
business right through. Fred England, who
dresses the King of Spain after the manner of
Hamlet, acts like a lay figure, and gets drowned
by ii\ nical applause every evening for his lusty,
light-and-shadeless rendering of the pleading,
wooing “ Hear me, Gentle Maritana.” Warwick
Gainor, who seems more woolly and double-
chinny than ever, distinguishes himself by
wearing a Irdeous, pinky, feathery hat.
Cissy Staunton, like most of the others, is
suffering from a severe cold, and the singing of
Annis Montague and the chorus continue to be
the best features of the show. Fred Duval, acting
for the Turners, informs us that “ II Trovatore ”
is billed for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
nights, and “ The Bohemian Girl ” for Saturday.
** * *
Charles Failing, Dan Tracey, Phoebe
Levy, Alf. Hazlcwood and others keep the show
alive at Sydney School of Arts, but the allegedly
humorous lectures of W. Robinson are not a whit
funnier than the buzzing of a blue-bottlo in a bell-
topper would be. Business, though not large, is.
decidedly payable.
** * *
At Moore Park, Dr. Carver, who, accord-
ing to Sydney Daily Telegraph, delights to see
his breakfast keeping itself hot by bounding over
the prairies, continues to scatter vitreous matter
to the four winds of heaven with great publ


acceptation. The Victorian steeplechaser, Spon-
dulix, gets over, it is said, a six-feet jump ; and
the pretty little pony, Wild America, easily clears
more than its own height. New features are
promised, including the lassooing of kangaroos
and a buck-jump act by Joe Brown.
* * * *
Next Saturday the fight between the big
back-blockers (each man scales 13J stone) comes
off at Coogee, and as both are carefully trained and
in fine fettle, a great slugging go may be expected.
The Sunday evening concerts continue to draw
good audiences to this popular Aquarium.
* * *
Despite the fact that business during the
past week erreatly improved, the Harry Rickards’
Sydney Gaiety season concludes on Saturday
night when the company go for a brief tour among
the suburbs ere disbanding. The chief feature of
the week has been the appearance and disappear-
ance of Noni Rickards, the entrepreneur’s charm-
ing little daughter as “The Vanishing Lady.” It
is more than probable that Larry Foley will keep
the house open with a variety-show.
* * * *
“Gettysburg” is still right thar, an’ don’
you forget it, and the American War is a more
familiar subject than Waterloo to Sydney folks.
* * * *
Fernandez, though suffering from a sprained
foot, made his fifth aerial jump on Saturday last
at Bondi, in the presence of many thousands. So
far, Messrs. Fernandez, Frost, and Wyburd have
kept faith with the public on every occasion, and
the giving of similar performances near any other
large centre of population would probably have
drawn ten times as many people. Fernandez may
go again next Saturday.
* * * *
Janet Achurch has been playing “ Devil
Caresfoot ” (an adaptation by Haddon Chambers
of Rider Haggard’s “ Jess,”) “Masks and Faces,”
and “ Camille ” to big business at Brisbane Royal.
The financial success of the latter play was much
enhanced by the backing out of the Acting-
Governor, Sir Arthur Palmer, a Queensland
edition of Sir John Robertson, and as hot as they
make’em up there, from his promise to visit the
latter play on the ground that (like bis own lan-
guage, by the way) it wasn’t “fit for ladies.”
The Achurch season finished on February 23rd ;
the company was picniced by the Johnsonians on
Saturday. The farcical contingent of the B. and
B. crowd open at Brisbane Royal on 13th March.
* * * *
The first Melbourne appearance of “The
Middleman,” on Saturday night, created a pro-
found impression at the Royal—a house where a
strong new play, with acting to match, comes
nowadays as a double surprise, like twins to the
father who has scarcely dared to hope for so much
all at once. The story of “ The Middleman ”
told in The Bulletin only six weeks back—deals
chiefly with a dilapidated genius, living for
pottery experiments alone and guilty of almost
criminal neglect to his prematurely grey hairs,
who, in revenge for the seduction of a favourite
daughter by his employer’s son, determines upon
running that bloated capitalist and sucker of
better men’s brains clean off the porcelain market.
To which end the outraged father bakes clay in
fiery furnaces which have to be fed with his last
sticks of furniture until success crowns a life of
self-denial, and the one-time proud employer is
fain to beg a billet from his emancipated slave.
This desirable consummation is made perfect by
the abrupt popping-up of the favourite daughter,
happily married to the gentleman who, in news-
paper language, accomplished her ruin. The
poor, wandering one is received with the
full measure of love and respect due to
the marriage-service, and the curtain comes
down in a hurry before the family can
put any delicate enquiries concerning baby.
The daughter episode, although providing
opportunity for a splendid outburst of parental
fury, is undoubtedly the weak feature of this fine
play. There are no apparent excuses for the
young lady’s indiscretion, other than the small
black moustache and decidedly toothy smile of
her idol—a fellow who, in the vain belief that
“their secret will never be discovered,” grim at
the ceiling and expresses gratitude to Providence
for what he believes to be a lucky escape. A
Pharisee of a Don Juan, thanking his stars that
his mash is not as other girls are. Just here, too,
it occur i to us that one father’s cry for revenge
upon the other father is very suggestive of
Bertuccio, the Fool, asking for his enemy’s heart
to be given into his mouth, that he may gnaw it
—gnaw it.
# * *
Charles Cartwright, as the guileless Blen-
karn, finding sufficient reward for his labour in its
artistic results, distinctly “knocked ” his audience,
as he had already done at the Sydney Garrick.
And in the two last acts, when his desire to make
money is hotter even than his baking-kilns, the
new artist knocked them again and again. No
performance at the Royal lias so stirred the public
heart since Charles Warner’s opening night in
“Drink.” How much the Australian Blenkarn
may be indebted to Willard, the “ creator ”of the
character, is impossible to say at this distance
from London. The present writer cannot imagine
Willard playing the part as realistically as it is
played here. But the influence of Irving is
palpable enough in Cartwright, and that
influence is all for good. Not a mimic of man-
nerisms, like Bellew, he seems to have caught
hold of what is really great in Irving’s art, and
Cartwright resembles his old boss most at those
moments when he is most carried away from him-
self by the scene. Miss Olga Nethersole, though
apparently anxious to win more sympathy than
can ever attach to the character of Blenkarn’s
giddy daughter, became a favourite at once. Miss
Mary Kingsley played the sister with more
brightness than she has shown in some formet
parts, and the men, with the exception of Oily
Deering vice Leake, are the Sydney people over
again. The Royal was filled except in the dress-
circle on Saturday, and its occupants showed
signs of uneasiness when Mary called attention
to the queer sort of people whom God gives money
to. It was the other parts of the house that
revelled in “ The Middleman,” and they will
doubtless fill for some time to come.
* * * *
At Melbourne Princess’ they changed
“ Yeomen of the Guard ” for “The Gondoliers,”
on Saturday night, though there was no particular
demand for this early revival of an opera that
wound itself down just before Christmas. One
small change in the company is for the better.
Sydney Deane impersonates the Duke of Plaza-
Toro’s own particular drum with less exuberance
of spirit than Knight Aston slung into the charac-
ter, and Miss Young, considerably improved by
pantomime practice, manages to let off a fleeting
smile at the Luiz, every now and then. Alto-
gether, the love-scene between these young people
now bears a faint resemblance to what it ought to
be. Elsewhere all is as of yore, and the hose that
were too big for their wearers in the first instance
still look baggy. “ Pepita ” follows “ The Gon-
doliers ” on a date to be determined by the course;
of business.
* *■ * #
“ The Miner’s Right” now goes well
throughout at the Alexandra. An attempt to
jump Dampier’s claim, in the second act, is a very
moving incident, and an incidental ditty on the
subject of Eureka Stockade has found something
resembling an air to pull it through. Appleton,
Vernon (who. by the way, is Howard V.’s brother)
and two or three others beside the Dampier family
put honest work into this show. There is some
good stage-management about, too, and take it
altogether, “ The Miner’s Right ” is fuller of Aus-
tralian tone, colour, and general interest than,
“ Robbery Under Anns,” The public know and
care a good deal more for goldmining than bush-
ranging.
** * *
“ Skipped by the Light, &c.” wobbles
along at the Opera House, but Messrs. Cackle and
Dingle don’t seem so light-hearted as one could
wish. A farce of this sort becomes limp and dis-
consolate without a large audience to cheer it on
the way. Snazelle is telling his yarn about Bill.
Adams, yet even Bill’s heroism doesn’t go far, and
the best of songs isn’t a whole comic opera. How-
ever, “ Skipped ” promises to continue for another
week.
** * *
“ Doctor Bill ” also continues for another
week. The laughter is slowly oozing out of that
retired medical person, and every now and then
the voice of one crying in the wilderness is heard
to insinuate that Bill must be approached in a
joyful spirit or else there is no joke in him. But
he’s all right until March 7th, when Miss Achurch
and Charrington start proceedings at the Bijou in
“ Devil Caresfoot.”
** * *
The company at the Gaiety Hall has been
strengthened, and other shows are doing nothing
in particular to hitch a paragraph to.
At Poverty Point.
It is officially announced that Mr. Musgrove, late of
W., G., and M., leaves behind him in Victoria property to
the value of £25,000, sufficient for any claim W. and G,
may have upon him.
Johnny Toole could not forego the delight of a parting
smack at Williamson and Garner. So he authorises his
older friend Georgio Coppino to publish his opinion that
the barn-like Melbourne Royal is superior to the Princess’,
which Warner and Fred. Leslie agree in ranking hardly
second to any house in the world. Toole will recommend
friend Irving to go to the beautiful Royal—with his fat
friend Baldy in a side-box. The explanation is because
Garner found more money in the clingisms of “Hero and
Leander.”
Grillparzer, the Austrian dramatist, author of Bellew
and Potter’s “ Hero and Leander,” was alive when the
last mail left, which is wonderful, for he is 100 years old,
born in January, 1791. His “ Medea ” was the foundation
of Legoure’s, which Rachel refused, and in which Ristori
made such a hit. There is a fine monument already to
Grillparzer, in Vienna, for Austria has been very slack in
turning out Goethes and Schillers. Free countries do it
best.
John Howson, the operatic singer, a native of Sydney,
is buried in New York, and his brother Frank is leader
of the orchestra at Madison Square Theatre. Can any-
one say what became of the sisters Celia and Emma ? In
the good days of the old Vic., in Pitt-street, the Howson
family was the attraction.
After the reading of Haddon Chambers’ play, “The
Idler,” to Alexander’s company at the St. James, writes a
London correspondent, one and all praised the play. Mr.
Chambers is on the crest of the wave of success. Well, he
deserves it, for he had a hard struggle. Sir Daniel
Cooper is the Macamas who helped him in adversity.
Frank Thornton’s daughter, Maude, has gained the
Savage Club scholarship at the Koyal College of Music,
writes a Bulletin London correspondent. She passed a
splendid examination, and bids fair to distinguish herself
as a pianist. Frank has been resting quietly since he
returned from Australia with his pocket full of shekels,
but he expects to be in harness again shortly at one of the
leading London theatres.
It is hinted in the S.A. Register th'-t a well-known
departing actress was interviewed ere sailing by a Mel-
bourne detective with a little bill. Eventually an
“obliging friend” shelled-out. When beauty is in dis-
tress the “ obliging friend ”is never far away. A certain
departing conductor seems to have escaped interview
entirely.
A late London cable stated that two series of orchestra*
concerts, one conducted by Charles Ha'le, had to be
abandoned, owing tr lack of support. A later cablegram
asserts that Halffi nas signed io give a second series of
Australian concerts, commencing at Melbourne in June.
As Sarasate is not coming out, the season may be all right.
HallC-lujah !
Terriss has got £2OO and costs from'the Princess Alice
Cornwell Whiteman Midas (who unsuccessfully appealed)
for the allegedly cabled statement appearing in the Lon-
don Sunday Times two days before his American debut
that he was received in New York with a “ noticeable
coldness.”
Searelle tells a Maoriland interviewer that he put no
money into the production of “The Black Rover,” but
took 10 per cent, of the gross, and £l5 weekly for con-
ducting, while his wife received £l5 as prima donna. By
these means he cleared £BOO. Lord Paget’s son, lessee of
London Avenue, agrees to produce “ Bobadil ” on similar
terms in September. Searelle produces his cantata,
“Australia,” at the Albert Hall in May. Happy is the
man who, not believing too much in himself, can induce
others to believe in him.
Dan Barry has been galvanising Geelong into life with
“Proof.” It would require to be “ over-proof ”to have
any lasting effect.
In his farewell Adelaide speech Toole threatened again
to visit Australia. Johnny has learnt a lot here, about
“Tummy,” for instance, and that Australians don’t like
plays in which a countenanoe-contorter swivels in the
centre of the stage on one leg while the hungry-looking
company revolve round the star at a mighty respectful
distance. George Lee, the bowld Australian bhoy,
selected as manager from among hundreds, sailed also in
the Victoria.
Adelaide Quiz says that, Fred Stanmaur acting for St*
Maur, and Mr. Oarey for D. O. Murray, with the Hon.
J. H. Gordon as umpire, the partnership dispute between
the principals was settled. Then it mysteriously hints
that cherchez la femme would be a aood thing under the
circumstances, but why two men should call in three to
settle an alleged love-dispute is not evident. The com-
pany, it is said, go to India and Japan, thence to London,
where D.O.M. expects to “par’lyse” them.
Marion Hood would have been the Joan of Arc in the
new burlesque at the London Opera Coraique, but she
resolutely refused to wear tights. She may have refused
solely from modesty, but most theatre-goers will attribute
her bashfulness to bad legs.
Apropos to the opening of D’Oyley Carte’s new theatre,
a London paper shows that not one manager of 20 years
ago remains in management, save Mrs. John Wood, who
has changed her house. Buckstone, Webster, Chatterton,
all goqe, and 11 theatres have gone, though replaced by
others in different spots. What a comment on the whirl
of theatrical life 1 In 20 years more, Bernhardt will be a
box-opener and programme-seller, or in charge of the
cloak-room, Langtry will be Queen of England, Potter
will—oh, shivery ! Potter at 601—and Blue Higgin will
be fully 40—at last.
Miss Violet Melnotte, who seems to possess a rich uncle,
is not unknown on the London stage, though the name is
so very peculiar that it will not be found in the London
Directory, finger-post to 4J millions, and her proper name
is not Smith. She is building a new theatre, the Melnotte
Theatre. What do you think of that ? Well, we think
that when Macaulay’s New Zealander exhumes an old
hair-pin from the Melnotte Theatre, he will fancy that it
was called after a character in a lost play by one Lyttleton.
Davis, old theatrical of Sunderland, writes in a London
paper his reminiscences of Irving's first appearance on any
stage, in 1856, when 18 years old, his part Orleans, in
“ Richelieu.” Strange to say, it was the first night of the
new theatre, and Irving had to speak the first line of the
play, which came in aptly with “Here’s to our enter-
prise ! ” bearing both on the house and his own career.
Davis remarks on the care with which Irving had made
up for his debut, evidently studying the costume of the
period with the greatest pains, so that he was the best-
dressed personage on the stage. But he failed dismally,
as an angular crank who couldn’t speak his lines, or, as
they used to call it, read, wherefore he went to Edin-
burgh, where he had the glorious chance of acting this
same Orleans to Barry Sullivan’s Richelieu, Sullivan hav-
ing, a few years before, been a stock-actor at the same
theatre, and acted Orleans to the Richelieu of Brooke or
Phelps.
Irving and Ellen Terry refused £40,000 and all expenses

“Dundreary” Sothern was annoyed once by two

am going !”

The children of Israel were there too, both fore and aft.
A new version of “Thespis and his Cart” was when
Coppin fetched out the Olympic Theatre, Iron Pot, for
Brooke, in Melbourne. About the same time Bishop
Perry brought out a lot of iron churches from England,
but which borrowed the idea deponent sayeth not—
whether Mephistopheles was the originator or the
imitator.
There is a revived interest in Charley Young. He used
to act tragedy fairly, as a young man, and appeared in
Melbourne old Queen’s as Claude Melnotte, also doing
William in “Black-eyed Susan” well. Mrs. Young
separated from Hermann Vezintoo, and we never see her
name on the English bills. She was in the original cast of
“Our American Cousin,” Haymarket, London, with
Dundreary Sothern, while Charley acted at the Princess’
Theatre, in burlesques like “ Lucrezia Borgia” and
“ Dido,” being put up as a kind of rival to Robson, and
much esteemed in female burlesque parts. His quarrel
with Barry Sullivan, in Melbourne, was through his
absurd refusal to act Tony Lumpkin.
An American paper philosophically discourses upon
Fat:—“Pink, palpitating fleshiness is often a profitable
constituent of feminine life, and I have grown to think
that the thick impenetrableness of the large, material
woman is more easily appreciable to the average play-goer
than more spiritual qualities. Abstract charms seldom
hit below the waist. You may have noticed that there is
a winning point in female obesity. It is an expansion
that just stops on the hither side of grossness, curving
and bulging, but never drooping. Firmness is a requisite.
Corsets should seem to be a superfluity. The well-fed,
red, wheezy man appreciates this condition to the utmost.
Yet I must not antagonise against the myriads who find a
charm in physical display. 1 let them adore their meat.
A huge congregation of people ranged in front of a heavy
red woman indicates public , appreciation, though the
approbation stops short at the heaviness and the redness
of the woman. Some of the greatest successes of the
stage are the result of well-distributed, thoughtfully-
revealed flesh. And women, as well as men, are affected
by these perfections. A girl will go into an orchestra-
stall to admire the neck of one of her own sex as excitedly
as a man will. And it is never slenderness that they rave
over—a poet’s ideal is scrawny in their eyes. They want
a Directory costume stretched over something as sub-
stantial as a big cheese. Were lan actress I would choose
flesh instead of magnetism. Cod-liver oil might save a
woman when raging ambition would relegate her to
oblivion.”
A question that is now agitating Australian musical
circles; How much beer can an operatic diva consume at
one sitting?
Some Cairns (Q.) amateurs recently went to Townsville
and gave a concert in aid of the Townsville hospital. The
nett profits handed over to that institution were Is. Id.
A Cairns paper describes the concert as a magnificent
success. So it was; that printer charged the amateurs
£l4 for printing their “ pioturesquely-artislio pro-
gramme.”

Beerbohm Tree has commissioned Haddon Chambers to

At Perth, W.A., an amateur operatic company has jus* l

Governor Robinson was present and looked unutterable
things at the warblers of the unfortunate Sullivan.
Several of the newly-appointed bald-heads from the Legis-

Henry Arthur Jones’ new play, “ The Dancing Girl,”
was produced for the first time at the Haymarket on
December 16, and was applauded to the echo. It is full
of imagination and subtle deta i, is thoroughly original,
and may fairly be set down as one of the foremost plays
of recent times. What a lucky nan is Beerbohm Tree!

John L. Sullivan, ’tis said, is now earning £6OO a week
as an actor. If he only gets a fifth of the sum, he earns
his money more reputably and with less personal risk
than at his old game. It’s queer, though, that a man
should command high salaries in one profession simply
because he has made a name in another. Women achieve
similar results through the divorce and breach-of-promise
courts.
They tell a story about an actor from ’Ome who found

The Maorilanders’ welcome to Sir George

It is whispered in the islands that Steven-

It is said that Robert Louis has got quite a lot of

mischief.
The question is—Who surrendered the
name of Schey, M.P., to plaintiff Proudfoot?
The Bulletin has now no comments to make on
the merits of the case, but it hopes that when the
libel-action comes on for trial Schey will so frame
his pleadings as to force the informer into the
witness-box, there to undergo the enduring igno-
miny of a public confession.
The secretary of the Pastoralists’ Union
at Melbourne has written an admonitory letter
to the secretary of the ditto, yet not exactly
ditto, at Adelaide, and informs the latter that
“the Victorian Pastoralists’ Union fail to see
what good purpose can be served ”by the Ade-
laide Conference with the shearers. Now, before
this letter reached Adelaide the “ good purpose”
had been served of drawing up a mutual shearing
agreement satisfactory to both sides.
As the Carmelite Nuns, about whose
unpaid-for Sydney establishment we now hear so
much, do not work, but spend the whole of their
time in “prayers, penance, and reparation.”-it
strikes The Bulletin that it is just about time
this set of morbid and anachronistic women were
lugged out into the open to do some good after
the fashion of the Sisters of Charity. The im-
mured Carmelites, after travelling the world'in
search of new mortifications, don’t appear to have
run up against a veritable Sheol upon earth until
they collided with the Sydney land-boom.
The howling-clown of Bruce Smith,
N.S.W. Minister for Works, when he attempted to
address his Glebe constituents last week was a fore-
taste of what is going to happen at next N.S.W.
general elections; just as the return of A. G. Taylor
for West Sydney was a sample in advance of the
force of the Labour Party when it comes to
the ballot-box. The Bulletin and Bruce Smith
are at opposite poles of politics, but it can’t help
seeing that the intense prejudice which exists
against that Minister in the minds of a large sec-
tion of the people is mainly founded on a statement
made by Willis, M.P., that in a private conversa-
tion Bruce Smith once declared that “ he would
shoot the workingmen down like dogs.” It is
only easy to accept sucli a yarn as probable when
one is acquainted with neither the personal
character of Bruce Smith, M.P.. nor that of
Willis, M.P. Mr. Crick, Willis’ henchman (or
is it Willis who is Crick’s henchman ?) hopes to
defeat the Minister at the general election.
The case of M‘Cann, sentenced to 15years’
for the alleged wounding of Mrs. Anderson at
Pennant Hills, N.S.W., calls for searching en-
quiry, The case for the prosecution virtually
rested on the evidence of the woman alone ; no
motive whatever was shown for the. deed ; the
prisoner was a steady man w ith a particularly excel-
lent character —an old soldier who wore a good -
conduct medal and held written testimonials
from reputable people. One juryman- whose
indefinable instincts may, after all, be true as
against the “ common sense ” of his eleven col-
leagues and the judge—long held out against a
conviction, saying he felt that M‘Cann never fired
the shot, and he was, it would appear, fairly
bullied into finding the prisoner guilty, for he was
publicly lectured by the judge on the enormity of
his conduct, his Honor at the same time making
what in the newspaper-reports reads like a fiery
speech for the prosecution. Finally, the solitary
juryman gave in and thus ended the farce of trial
by jury: for The Bulletin holds it an utterly
unwarrantable thing for a judge to admit
his official cognisance of the opinion of
an individual juryman even when the foreman so
far forgets himself as to disclose the secrets of the
jury-room—it being only with the final verdict of
the whole jury as delivered by its foreman and not
with the opinion of any one juryman, that the
Court can deal. The Bulletin quite agrees with
Mr. Justice Windeyer in one respect—that the
juror who dissented is unfit to be a juryman': any
man who can, after five hours’consideration, come
to the conclusion that a prisoner on trial for his
life is innocent and then be bounced into finding
a verdict of guilty, doesn’t own enough grit to
serve the ends of Justice. The daily press of
Sydney is unanimous in condemning the action of
the juryman. The sternest of lessons is utterly
lost on the daily press. Only the other day 12
men (not even one of whom had doubts) found
Isidor Blittner guilty of rape at Sydney, and be
was ordered to die, tiie judge fully concurring in
the verdict, and the man’s doom being in due
course finally sealed by the Executive Council.
And yet, facts (shut out at the trial because of
the police, who are paid by the whole community
to do justice, having considered it their duty to
rake-up only evidence against the prisoner, in-
stead of inquiring also as to the character of bis
accuser) having come to hand, Biittner, on the
very day appointed for his death, walked out of the
condemned cell a free man and accepted a gratuity
from the N.S.W. Government! One juryman of
keen instinct might have saved that man's con-
demnation. The Bulletin hopes that the next
juryman who, whether fie can explain his reasons
or not, conscientiously believes an accused man to
be innocent, will publicly and forcibly resent the
Judge’s insolent interference with his functions as
a citizen, and will, if necessary, die on the floor inf
the jury-room in assertion of his right to give the
prisoner the benefit of any reasonable doubt which
may linger in his brain.

WITH the exception of its neck, that huge
peninsula, North America, is in the hands of
English-speaking people. It is more than pio-
bable that, as time goes on, they will get a tight
grip on the neck as well, so that ere long but
one tongue may be heard between Panama am I
Alaska—in other words, over a territory almost
three times the size of Europe. Britons of the
Fkoude pattern look upon this circumstance as
an example of the vitality and robustness of
what they call the Anglo-Saxon race. But
with languages as with species it is not always
the fittest that survive. Nearly a third ot the
human family Speaks a tongue which to the re-
maining two-thirds appears but one remove
from the noise of a poultry-farm. But . the
Peculiarity of this North American continent is
that, while the same speech with a few excep-
tions, as amongst the French of Canada, and
the Germans, Scandinavians, Italians, aiidothci
Europeans of the United States, is heard fiom
the Arctic Circle almost to the tropic ot
Cancer, the greater portion of the huge area is
about equally divided between a powerful
independent Republic and a weak province
Which apparently glories in its subjection to a
little island separated front it by thousands of
miles of ocean. To discover a modi'* nreuch
between this populous and powerful Democracy
and its huge, sparsely-peopled, northern neigh-
bour which elects to continue in political
swaddling-clothes, is the problem of the houi—-
a problem which in the opinion of many w ill
ultimately have to be solved by blood and iron
# * *
As the years go by the position becomes
more and more intolerable. On the »ne
side we have a potent people nlade up
of those who went across the sea to
escape the curses of monarchy, aristocracy
and priestcraft which kept them in squalor
at home ; and of those whose fathers broke
away from the old order of things over a hun-
dred years ago for the purpose of proving that
men could govern t hemselves without the in-
cubus of hereditary spawn. On the other, there
is a people which lias long enjoyed a certain
measure of self-government, but which not only
hesitates to go alone or to bear its share in
forming a vast confederacy of free men, hut,
with the delight of an infant over a new rattle,
still encourages its public men to covet the
crosses, ribbons and pinchbeck titles thrown to
them by grinning officials from another hemis-
phere. In one sense the Canadians are far more
fortunate than the Australians. It has been
asserted that, should the latter prematurely
demand and obtain independence, they would
run the risk of having portions, possibly the
whole, of their great island annexed by some
marauding power or powers anxious for distant
and prosperous possessions. As we have pointed
out in our leading article in this issue, it is ex-
tremely improbable thatsneb would be the case—
that Australian independence would be threa-
tened from outside, any more than the indepen-
dence of the weak South American Republics. But
whatever force the argument has when applied
to Australia, it has none at all vv hen applied to
Canada. For no European country w ould dare
to lay hands on an independent C unada while a
Democracy of t>*> millions vv ho ridiculed the
pretensions of monarchs was just across the
way. Certain it is that if the French had
not left Mexico in time the soldiers who put
down the rebel slaveholders would have been
called upon to march South and eject them.
Hence it follows that a Canadian Republic,
even if weak, would have nothing to fear from
over-sea enemies , while a Canada cut up into
handy States instead of being divided as at
present into unwieldy provinces, would have
everything to gain and nothing to lose by in-
corporation with its great southern neighbour.
It would be freer and safer than at present—as
free as Pennsylvania or Ohio ; as safe as Massa-
chusetts or New York. While possessing local
Parliaments to preside over domestic affairs its
senators would have a voice in the world’s
grandest Senate, its delegates a place in the
world’s greatest Congress; its farmers and
manufacturers a market at their doors.
The present position of Canada is the best
illustration the world affords of the short-
sightedness employed in governing men. Every
argument that can be used in favour of a Ger-
man or of an Australian confederacy applies
with double force to the Dominion’s admittance
into the United States. Except in two particu-
lars, the gain would be immense. There would
lie no further need for an English nobleman to
preside at Ottawa nor would society be agitated
on each 24th day of May by the birthday
honours conferring on certain citizens the right
to append certain letters of the alphabet to
their names. As the years went by, however,
it is highly probable that the Canadians would
gradually come round to the opinion that a
fairly tolerable method of government is
possible without a foreigner to guide their
councils or a sovereign to send them ribbons
with crosses or medals attached. Into the
country would then pour the enterprise and the
capital of their southern fellow-citizens, while
the prospect of a man of Canadian birth and
sympathies presiding as First Magistrate at
Washington over the greatest, freest and most
powerful of Republics would be far from remote.
This, surely, should be sufficient to satisfy any
ordinary ambition. In the nature of things
there is no reason why a President on the
Potomac over 80 or 90 millions of free citizens
should not hold his head as high as
Premier on the St. Lawrence over one-twentieth
that number of subjects. To us, looking at the
matter from an entirely unbiassed standpoint,
it appears marvellous how the Dominion con-
tinues to look across the Atlantic for bogus
sympathy and indifferent support, while at its
doors is a great kindred people prepared to give
genuine sympathy and real support for the
asking. It merely shows how men are the
slaves of custom, and how, like the Jews of old,
a nation may become so habituated to depend-
ence that the very thought of striking out for
itself or of walking alone sends a shiver through
the whole community.
& # #
Having touched upon the beiiefits that would
certainly accrue to Canada through throwing
in her lot with the Union, it Would be as well,
before dealing with the present quarrel and the
probable result of armed intervention, to con-
sider how the incorporation we advocate would
affect England and America. Semi-independent
colonies like Canada, Australasia, and South
Africa, which have cohtrol of their own lands
and enjoy the right Of fashioning their own
tariffs, are of no special value to the parent
State. Years ago it was asserted that the
strength of Britain lay within the fOUr seas, and
the statement has never been successfully com-
bated; When the mother coflntry keeps in its
Own hands the administration of the depen-
denciefe—as in the case
of India, Ceylon, ami
the Dutch tropical
islands, the case is
entirely different. It
may be said that Britons
emigrating to, the
colonies need not change
their flag. What good
is, that to England
When the distant, self-
governing lands become
independent, as they
must become in the pro-
cess of time, the alle-
giance of the whole
community is
at one sweep. From a
military and a naval
standpoint, colonies con-
stituted like those of
Britain are a source of
weakness and not of
strength to the old land.
They demand protec-
tion, and confer none
beyond their own bor-
ders. For, in spite of
the Soudan example, set
by a New South Wales
enthusiast, who allowed
his feelings to outrun
Lis judgment, the pros-
pect of drafting the
youth of the dependen-
cies to qssist in pro-
tracted struggles thou-
sands of miles from their
home may be at once
dismissed. The Govern -
ment entertaining such
an idea would quickly
go under. The only
w r ay, therefore, in which
autonomous colonies can
benefit the parent State
is by trade. But with
territories empowered
to frame their own
tariffs like independent
countries, the commer-
cial argument becomes
untenable.
# * *
A good deal of weight
has been assigned to the
expression ‘ ‘ trade fol-
lows the flag.” Other
things being edbal, it no
doubt will follovy the
national standard. But
it will not follow it in
defiance of clear econo-
mic laws. The patriot-
ism which will induce a
Canadian or Australian
consumer to give three
halfpence for a British
article when a French
one of a precisely similar
kind can be had for a,
penny has, so far, re-
mained undiscovered.
All these considerations
go toshow that the value
of semi - independent,
constitutionally-governed colonies to the parent
State is more than problematical. Why, then,
does England stick to hers, and even fight for
them, as in the case of South Africa and New
Zealand ? Some years ago it is certain that
Britain would gladly have allowed the most of
her over-sea possessions to set up for themselves.
They, however, were too timid and unripe.
Like the American loyalists, who through thick
and thin supported the insensate policy of
George the Third and his minions, they
trembled at the very proposal to go alone. It
is this feeling of national pusillanimity, so wide
spread unfortunately in Australia, that seems
to characterise the Canadians even when Nature
and common-sense combine to show them where
their true safety lies. The people, fairly pros-
perous and decidedly apathetic, look with fear on
a change which would arouse them from their
lethargy, while the leaders view with apparent
disfavour such a sweeping situation as would
cut off the supply of brand-new London decora-
tions and reduce the knights of the social and
political chess-board to mere pawns. To cut

themselves adrift from the “fountain of honour
'by the Thames, with the certainty that no such
alphabetical fountain exists, or is likely to exist,
in Washington, is more than they can bear. In the
meantime their country drifts nearer and nearer

well happen that the boon of social and politi-

For, it must never be forgotten that, in any
serious quarrel between England and America,
there is no power in the British Empire to keep
the Yankees ont of Canada. British soldiers
know this, and it was but the other day that
Lord Wolsely bluntly admitted it in one of
those magazine articles by which he appears to
relieve the tedium of these piping times of peace.
In a few months the Union could pour across
the border more soldiers than there are males
in all Canada. Once the stars and stripes
flew from the citadels of Quebec and Montreal
it is almost certain that no British successes at
sea would contribute to lower it. |lnto the
merits of the highly-strained relations at
present existing between the Republic and the
Monarchy, it is unnecessary to enter beyond
saying that, as usual, women appear to have a
share in the matter. Fashionable females find
that sealskin jackets and cloaks are not only
comfortable, but becoming. The pursuit
and capture of seals for the purpose of
relieving them of their skins has, there-
fore, become a lucrative calling. Away

sea separating the north-western extremity of
America from the north-eastern of Asia—about
the place where Eugene Sue’s Wandering .lew
makes Ids appearance every century or two—
those foolish animals are still to be found in
thousands, in spite of the yearly slaughter that
supplies the dainty ladies of London, Paris and
New York with the much-prized skins. Years
ago the United States bought from the Russians
the American shore of this sea with a good-
sized block of bleak peninsula attached. The
northern shore of this inhospitable purchase is
swept by the chill waves of the Frozen Ocean or
pounded by the icebergs that swoop down upon
it from the Pole. It seems about the last place
in the world capable of producing anything
for which men would fight. It is, how-
ever, on the western and south-western sides of
of this wild Alaskan land, and on the
hyperborean islands scattered in the neighbour-
hood that the seals breed and flourish till they
become acquainted with the American harpoon
and discover when too late that their skins so
far from affording them protection are the
proximate cause of their destruction.
* * *
The American case appears to be that in buy-
ing the Russians out of Alaska they also bought
all the rights formerly enjoyed by the Musco-
vites. Among these rights is that of the
Ownership of all the seals in that remote portion
of the Pacific Ocean. The British and, seem-
ingly, other nations deny that the Russians could
dispose of the sole right of seal-killing because
they never held it. Thus the matter stands —
the Yankees saying “ If your people come into
our sea to steal our seals we shall capture and
confiscate their to which M. Bull
replies, “ It’s no more your sea than mine
or any other nation. You can purchase
a slice of the open ocean and call it yours
as if it were a piece of land. The o'pen sea is
the world’s highway, and your jurisdiction over
it extends to only a few miles from the shore.
If yott capture my vessels and sell them, I shall
feel bound to do the same by yours.” To be
brief, the American argument is that what is
known as Behring Sea is in reality but a narrow
strip of water belonging to the land, as much
as the Gulf of California, while the British aver
that it is nothing of the kind. It is for the
purpose of proving which is the correct view to
take of the case that men are said to be now
actively employed in both countries getting
ready ships and shot, boarding-pikes, cfitlasses,
machine-guns, conical shell, torpedoes, rockets,
and the various methods employed by men for
convincing others of the truth. '

And now it remains but to speculate on the
probable result of a conflict between the small
European Island and the large American Con-
tinent, The loss of Canada, if that could be
called a loss which would really be a gain to the
Dominion itself, would be inevitable. With the
surrender of the Northern province all land
operations, except the bombardment of sea-
board cities, would probably cease, and hostili-
ties be confined to sea duels fought in every
ocean, and to the practical destruction of sea-
borne commerce by sw r arms of swift cruisers. If
the American seaports can be threatened and
even wrecked from the ocean-side, late naval
manoeuvres have shown how dozens of British
coast towns could be treated in the same man-
ner. The struggle would be an extremely
bitter one, for Transatlantic children have been
taught from their cradles how the British of 80
years ago pressed American seamen, obliged
them to fight by means of torture, and, as an
example of insensate wantoness worthy of
Bashi-Bazouks, blew up the Capitol at Wash-
ington, Nor does America forget that a
quarter of a century ago, when the very fate of
the Union was trembling in the balance, all
aristocratic, official, conservative, respectable
and church-going England prayed night and
day for the success of the slave-owners. For
over half-a-century they had wept over the
wrongs of the negro ; but when men laid down
their lives by the thousand for the purpose of
righting those wrongs, the noble British states-
men and editors discovered that the Southern
planters were models of chivalry and should be
supported. At present the English fleet is
strong—the American comparatively weak—so
that for a time operations would mainly consist
of isolated encounters between war-ships and a
complete disturbance in commerce. It would,
however, require but a word to arouse in the
Union a spirit that would count no cost and
estimate no loss till it had upon the waters a
naval strength able to sweep the seas.

The Duke of Portland— aged 33—is the

Ins dimensions are likely to be something awful

will stare to train down before then, and get rid
of his pre-eminence in beef. A time is at hand
when the Duke who can keep ahead of the in-
furiated populace in a stern chase will be the only
kind of duke with any chances of longevity.
Charles Keene, the celebrated Punch

that he did not spend £2OO a year. He is now
dead, and has left £30,000 behind him. Born in
1823,’his first Punch drawing appeared in 1850,
his last in August, 1890.
PLOITICAL POINTS
John Hurley’s latest—farewell, it may be
—address to his Katoomba (N.S.W.) constituents
was a patchwork of Toryism in glaring dyes.
Alarmed at the labour-threatenings, many
N.S.W. members hint their intention of aban-
doning Parkes and playing lone-hands at the
general election. Too late.
Postmaster General O’Connor solemnly
says that, so far as the present N.S.W. Govern-
ment is concerned* “ everything that man could
desire under the all-seeing eye of the Creator, has
been formulated to be carried into effect for the
benefit of the country,”
Earl punraven urged Salisbury to another
bogus colonial conference, in London, to con-
spire against the United States and the world
at large; also to make the Australian taxpayer
sweat more money for fleets. Salisbury, who sees
how hopeless the game is, snuffed him out.

Mr. J. D. Fitzgerald the N.S.W. Labor
delegate is going through the English “Union”
books to ascertain the exact amount of money

been received.
London Daily Chronicle during the life-
time of its late proprietor, old Edward Lloyd,
was a democratic paper only in name,
viewed from a modern standpoint. It has
now, under the management of Ids sons, begun to
speak in earnest on behalf of the democracy, and
is full of steni o' ophecy as to what will happen
should the ni,->ery of the workers not be relieved.

Conference :—The squatters’ agreement ignore B
the unions and the eight-hours system; puts
yellow, brown, and black labour on the same foot-
ing as white labour ; penalises the bush-worker at
the pleasure of his employer; and reduces bush-
labourers’ wages variously from 10 to 33 per cent.
The S.M, Herald finds itself amazed at
the different ways in which the shearing difficulty
is being managed in South Australia and Queens-
land respectively.—a compromise by conference in
the former, an armed rupture in the latter. The
Herald conveniently forgets that the Queensland
squatters absolutely refused to confer, and un-
fairly cornered the shearers. The contrast abso-
lutely proves the very opposite of what the
Herald would establish.

Premier Macdonald says that Farrer,
Editor of the Toronto Globe (Upper Canada) is

States —the Globe is the most influential'paper
in Canada, the only one read outside —and that

influential paper in Lower Canada, openly advo-
cates a Republic 1 Macdonald must be answered

“Bob” Phi Ip, M.L.A., is reported to
have told the Townsville Separation League that
Macrossan and 15 other Separationist members of
Parliament had decided to support Premier Grif-
fith’s decentralisation scheme. If borne out by
results, this statement means that the Griffith
scheme will be passed by Parliament next session,
and that the next Queensland general election will
be fought on these two principal points—land-
sales as against extra taxation ; and Australian
Federation.
G. R. Sims observes : ■“ You can no more
expect the Irish people to throw over the mail
who they believe will give Ireland the in-
dependence for which she has struggled for
centuries than you can expect the victims ,qf
consumption to ostracise Hr. Koch if they find
out that he is not a perfectly moral man. The
poor victims of consumption do pot go to tills
doctor for moral example, hut for physical salva-
tion ; and the people do : not follow Mr.
Parnell as a moral mentor, bitt as a political
saviour.”
The British Government could command
a majority of only 32 votes against a direct
motion for the disestablishment of the Church of
England in Wales and that with a Tory
majority in the House. Gladstone supported the
motion. Another 10 years should see the Church
of England disestablished both in Wales and
England, and the Bench of Bishops cast into the
hades of oblivion ; arid a score of years should see
the House of Peers exported to the crater of
Krakatoa as rubbish fit only to be burnt.
In France there is very little annual
natural increase among the French population,
but the Canadian French’ are, perhaps, the most
procreative people’ in the world. The (Dominioh
Government, wishing to encourage the ‘growth of

acres of land to every man having 12 children

A Walcha (N.5..W.) man found a curious
kind of "snake and took the trouble to forward it
to the Sydney Musentn, with a request that it
might be photographed,"classified find named after
Governor Jersey. For answer’, he received a
letter informing him that the “reptile, ’’ was'a
common tihnia soliu’rii —intestinal tape-worm.
He was a Hebrew tailor, recently initiated
into the glorious mysteries of Freemasonry, and
at the first lodge meeting his eAgle eye'fell upon a
man who hadn’t provided himself with a dress-
suit. Whereupon he gave the other fellow a
business card and'a succession of grips, and hissed
in his ear—“ Favour "me \ ith a call, and you vill
find that I yill do the leetle job very reasonable
for von of the brethren.” This incident just about
.explains the meaning of the term, “ Masonic
.craft.”
0. C. Kingston, the Adelaide politician,
intends to make his mark at the Federal Con-
ference. He recently refused all legal work, in-
cluding the defence in the Lo.wenthal murder-
case, and sever 1 other important briefs, and then
went away to Bridgewater to ruminateqn Federa-
tion. When the Playford Ministry left office,
Kingston went in hard for law, and has .worked
up one of the biggest practices in South Aus-
tralia, but his love for politics influences him in
everything, and he sacrifices everything for it.

Tummy as a chubby, baldheaded child, singing

Sir Henry Pavkcs calls his private resi-
dence at Balmain “ Hampden Cottage ” after
John Hampden, the old-time English democrat.
TheN.S.W. daily papers will, however, persist
in writing of the place as “ Hampton Villa ” —in
which error there lurks a good deal of keen
though unconscious satire. For, after all, there
is much more in common between old, man Parkes
and Hampton Court with its array of State-fed
pensioners who sponge on the Treasury than there
is between him and the sturdy Eriglish Man of
the People about whom he talks so much and
whom he imitates so little.
When the marriage of the late Emperor
Frederick with the English Princess Royal %vas
proposed in ! 68, Bismarck loudly protested against
any “blood alliances with those scrofulous
Guelphs.” Bismarck’s protest has been vindicated
by time. The epileptic Duke of Albany died
suddenly ; the Duke of “ Collars and Cuffs ”
suffers from gout, eczema and general debility;
the Duchess of Fife shows signs of consumption,
the Princess Maud is a victim to fits, the physical
misfortunes of the Princess of Wales since her
marriage have been a scandal, and the ear of
Kaiser Wilhelm 11. is jeopardising the peace of
Europe.

Another terror has been added to the
Sydney “Block.” A smilinar, pleasant-looking
matron, the other day, in the vicinity of Sydney
G.PiO., saw a young woman with a baby in her
arms. As appears to be nature’s uncontrollable
custom with married women, the matron glanced
approvingly at the infant and passed on. She had
gone but a few yards when she felt a tug at her
elbow, and was accosted by the young woman who
carried the baby. “Are you married, mem?”
“lam.” “Have you any children?” “No;
why do you ask?” “Because I thought you
might like a baby. You may have this one. I
hate it myself, although it is a very nice baby.”
“ Ye-e-s, it is a nice baby, but I am sure my hus-
band wouldn’t let me take it. You see, as he
says; any young child whom one adopted might be
physically or mentally imperfect—it might be
subject to fits, or madness, or some disease.”
“ You needn’t be afraid,” retorted the persistent
babe-offering mother, still pursuing her point, “ I
am sure the baby is all right and isn’t either ill or
mad. lam healthy enough, and, if you still have
any doubts, I will briny you the young man that
you may judge for yourself.” Solemn fact.

Mr, Sydney Burdekin has fulfilled the
prophecy made at the time of his election to the
mayoralty of Sydney by announcing his intention
of resigning shortly with a view to a trip to
Europe. Mr. Burdekin, as the biggest Sydney
landlord, has an income which may be moderately
estimated at £60,000 a year, and is understood to
aspire to a baronetcy. It is also understood that
he would have a much better chance of obtaining
very influential feminine assistance in attaining
the object of his ambition had the charming Mrs.
Burdekin not been dressed so nicely during the
Caringtonian regime.

Alderman Manning will probably be
Sydney’s new mayor. Mr. Manning, who is a
comparatively new alderman—and looks it, for he
has a slim waist, and his nose still maintains an
Interesting pallor—is not unconnected with the
conveyancing profession, which he is understood
to have found very lucrative indeed. As Mayor
he will have a distinct advantage over nearly all

It is no doubt true that Mr. Burdekin
would have greatly liked to visit London as Mayor
Of the N.S. W. metropolis, and would have done
so had he not been told in plain terms by the local
aldermen that he would be required to resign the
mayoral chair before leaving Sydney. The veto
Was, considering all things, rather spiteful.
Sydney has done without a Bishop, it has done
Without a Governor, and could very well do with-
out a Mayor.
* * *
Thus the S.M. Herald “ Lady Jersey
comes to N.S. Wales at a time when the functions
of a Governor’s wife are hardly less important
than those of the Governor himself.” Oppositely
put. Re-construct it and read “ Lady Jersey
comes to N.S. Wales at a time when the functions
of a Governor are almost as frivolous and nominal
as those of a Governor’s wife, or housekeeper.”

Lady Jersey said the other day on her
arrival at Albury, that she had not been in Aus-
tralia long enough to enable her to form any social
or political opinions. Whereupon a wit remarked
that she had not been long enough in Australia to
enable Lord Jersey to form any political or social
opinions.
# * *
Governor Jersey, who has made no secret
of his intentions to follow the lines laid down by
Baron Carington for “tightening the silken”
(and other) “bonds,” appears to have “gone nap”
early in the game. Ho has “most impressively
read the lessons ”at Sutton Forest church. His
lordship should have waited a little while, and
pondered whether posing as an amateur cleric
would not bend to somewhat restrict his operations
in a few of the more gay and festive fields of
Caringtonian activity. It will be remembered
that the Baron’s furthest venture into the regions
of public godliness was when he presided over a
meeting of the—are you listening, Tummy?—
Young Women’s Christian Association. Another
thing, the present is a most inopportune time for
public displays of devotion. Nearly everybody
now wanted by the N.S.W. detectives is described
in the Police Gazette as wearing a halo.
'# # #
However, The Bulletin is willing to
issue a license empowering the Earl to act as an
amateur parson, and will even appoint Governor
Jersey its private chaplain on one or two condi-
tions : Eirstly, that His Ex. does not publicly
sympathise with any fires that may take place at
the bedding or other factories of firms who take
away the coats and hats of their employes every
morning and do not return them until night for
fear that the employes should go out to drink or
unlawfully convey from the premises any of the
firm’s goods. Also, that he doesn’t allow all the
newspapers in the land to record in their columns
every fiver which he doles out in charity. ,

Dear Bulletin, — In re your well-timed
snarl at the mannerless and haughty Anglo-
Indian aristocracy : I recently travelled from
London in the s.s. Massilia. In the Suez Canal
we were tied up for a couple of days as the
Valetta had run aground ahead of us. All traffic
being stopped, six P. and O. vessels accumulated
at our station about 15. miles from Port Said, and
amongst them was the Coromandel; bound for
Calcutta with a passenger-list consisting princi-
pally of noli me tanyere Anglo-Indians but con-
taining several Australians. Some of her pas-
sengers wished to give a ball and to invite from
the other ships. One afternoon a boat cariie off to
the Massilia with an officer and some other people
who told the ladies of the latter vessel of the pro-
posed dance, asked them whether they would go,
A RULING PASSION.
Milkman (yelling after the manner of his kind) : “ Mee-awk!”
Daisy (domestic to Mrs. Potterpoint) :“ None to-day, thank you, Missus is taking it from
a man as has a Jarsey Cow.”
and promised to forward a formal invitation. The
ball took place that night, but no invitation
arrived. The next day we heard the reason. Ihe
Massilia being an Australian boat the “Anglo-
Indians ” declined to invite the “ Anglo-Austra-
lian nobodies.” Comment is needless. Of course
there were Anglo-Indians on the Massilia, and as
two of us sat at dinner with half-a-dozen of them
and were mistaken for Britishers we were afforded
fair opportunity to “pull their leg.’ May I add
that the average Anglo-Indian female may con-
sider herself very aristocratic but she is ' very
difficult to gaze upon.”—-Traveller.
# * *
“Traveller’s ” experience only fits in with
that of every other voyaging Australian who
doesn’t sandwich his talk with “haw” and opens
his mouth as the Almighty intended that it should
be opened. The Anglo-Indians, taken all round,
are a set of ineffable snobs who don’t disguise
their contempt for everything Australian. How-
ever, it would appear that, all the same, they cal-
culate on receiving military assistance from this
country in the not far distant time when they
shall be ground between the upper and nether
mill-stones of Russia and the niggerdotu which
thev have so long ruled with kicks. Having so
long been mixed up with black trash the Anglo-
Indian is not fit to sit down with a white man.
As to the Anglo-Indian women, any Australian
who allows his womankind to be mixed up with
them in any way does so - at his •own peril.

Apparently driven from their native
Sydney by the derision of an unimperialistic
populace, that gorgeous corps, the Sydney Lancers
—which once sought to expel a man from its ranks
because he sold socks-appear to have taken
refuge at Bowral, where, at the opening of the
Bovvral Club last Saturday, they turned up in full
war-paint with flowing pennants and waving
plumes to act as a vice-regal escort. It is true
there were but 45 of them, of whom 17 or more
were officers, but no matter. Lord and Lady
Jersey.were received at the club by an individual
bearing the inappropriate name of Lackey.
Judging from recent developments, when federa-
tion becomes an accomplished, fact Bowral will, be
constituted a neutral zone with an Emperor and a
Court and an army—the Sydney Lancers-of its
own. As.;

■’ 41.81ue-Ribbon ” Clark, Mayor of Bris-
bane, knows the advertising ropes-. The other
-day he announced that, in view’of his well-known
opinions re the drink question, be did not intend
to■ avail himself of his ex-officio mayoral privilege
of sitting on the Licensing Bench. And, imme-
diately all tne gab-gobbling public buzzed adu-
lantly. The publicans voted him a brick and an
“open foe,” though, they have hated him for years
as a teetotal street-preacher. But the truth is
that Clark could not sit on the Licensing Bench if
he would, as he is Vice-Grand-limmnydummy or
Soraethingorother in almost every Waterbright
Guild; and there is a clause in the Liquor Act
expressly forbidding the inclusion in the Bench of
any member of a temperance organisation. Simi-
larly, publicans cannot sit. (N. Bi- But brewery

One of the things which have been re-
cently invented to make this dismal world feel
glad is the infantine wig, a contrivance which is
spreading considerably in fashionable circles, it
has been noted by deep thinkers Hint the red and
reckless infant of two or three years generally
looks short and scrubby about the thatch, whereas
that heavenly howler ought to have long golden
curls to tone down its ears and give it a seraphic
asuect generally. Consequently the misguided
and incomplete inhabitant is seized with a strong
hand and shaved, and while in the seclusion of the
domestic hearth it runs about in a totally raid
condition, like its own great-grandfather rushing
around with a rattle and a wooden horse. But
when it goes out it exhibits a magnificent collec-
tion of ringlets that excite general admiration,
except when the offspring takes off its ornament
and runs along whooping and trailing it in the
gutter, and then its apoplectic mother starts
wildly down the street in pursuit of her
hairless descendant, and bangs it with her um-
brella. We did not suspect this dodge till the
the other day, when we fell over a bald-headed
heir who was taking a short cut through the
Domain with his scalp in his hand and a distracted
parent toiling behind: but having discovered it
we intend only to admire the plain or garden in-
fant with the cropped cranium for the future.

The story goes that when Ninian Melville,
M.L.A., dined with Lord Carington at Govern-
ment House, Sydney, for the first time, lie was
amazed at the splendour of the plate, and plush,
and things in general. Leaning over to Dibbs,
who had “ been there before,” the dazzled Ninian
whisnered hoarsely—“ls this the usual style in
this 'establishment, or is it a special get-up in
honour of me?” “Nothing special, I assure
you,” replied Dibbs; “it’s just the customary
thing.” “By Jingo!” jestingly exclaimed the
astonished undertaker, “no more of your demo-
cracy for me !” There’s many a true word said in
jest -
Snobbishness, writes a London corres-
pondent of The Bulletin, is rampant just now
.at the Royal Colonial Institute. Lord Carington
is to read a paper on his Australian experiences,
Wales being in the chair. There is a mad rush
for tickets as a matter of course, and it is doubt-
ful if the Princes Hall will hold all who will be
present. Asa rule, papers on Australian subjects
are read to empty benches, but “ Charley’s ” ap-
ICES!
Don Carlos, you will come again
Unless you be a ninny;
Whilst other darlings sad remain—
They must give way to Minnie;
She bids you (having doubtless grown
Adept in love’s devices)
Cdme partly for herself alone,
And partly for che ices.
Some girls would bridle up arid say—
“ The Don shall woo me madly,
Or else the wretch can stop away ;
I’ll do without him gladly.”
But Minnie, being “ wide ” and cute,
Her absent boy entices
To bring along his Sunday suit
By advertising “Ices.”
Don Carlos, you are young and smart,
And fickle in ali'ection,
But Minnie means to get your heart
Completely in subjection ;
She knows, as Walpole used to prove,
That all men have their prices ;
Her Don wants more than love for love,
And so she throws in ices.
At nightfall when the sultry heat
Is tempered, Don, by breezes,
And each heart feels the other’s beat
In ecstasy of squeezes,
A flush suffuses Minnie’s face
As, e’en at passion’s crises,
She gently breaks from your embrace
And cools you down with ices.
O ! love it is a pleasant dream
Which makes the senses tingle,
And little girls so ardent seem
So long as they are single.
But when the wedding-bells arc rung,
And Don with Minnie splices,
You'll find the song of love Is sung
By lips as cold as ices.

The Melbourne Foorce is threatening to

favourite, assuming a very serious expression) s
“ H’m, the fact is, sir, some of the gentlemen just
won’t eat them unless they have the strings on.”
William hereupon solemnly takes his departure—
with the beans —leaving the table in smiles. It is
suggested that all Sydney bills-of-fare shall in
future contain more definite particulars, say—
Beans with strings,
Beans without strings.

Why should a man at an hotel-table eat
bread from a loaf which has been handled by
half-a-dozen people who have had outs from it ?
If loaf-bread is required by people who won’t eat
rolls it should be sliced by a waiter instead of
being mauled by the general public, who are
under no obligation to the hotel-proprietor either
to be clean or to be exempt from contagious
disease. We have yet to meet the man who
prefers bread upon which another fellow may have
been rubbing Ins eczematous paws. The public
loaf is far too general an Australian institution.

It is a breach of orthodox medical etiquette
to advertise, bnt it strikes The Bulletin that the
medical profession, taken all round, is very keen
indeed on advertising when it has the slightest
chance, Just notice what magnificent reclames
some of the doctors are allowing themselves to
get in connection with Koch’s lymph for the
treatment of consumption ! The splash which has
been made by one or two doctors so fortunate, or
unfortunate, as to have received supplies of this
fluid, reminds us of the enterprising medico who,
when the smallpox scare was in full blast at
Sydney, a few years ago, took a house, moored a
calf fore-and-aft on the balcony in full view of
passers-by, and posted up a notice —“Pure vaccine
from the calf, one guinea.” He netted hundreds
of guineas.
# * *
By the way, a Sydney doctor (who has
just got a supply of “ tuberculine ”) to whom a
daily paper gives a column and a quarter adv. in
this connection, is represented as saying to the
reporter :
The treatment has to be very carefully Carried out. it
has to be accompanied by the most complete and scien-
tific methods. Very careful watching is needed during
treatment. I have no doubt that good results can be
obtained. People must not be swayed by the adverse
criticisms that have appeared, for, as I have pointed out,
the best authorities in Germany are in accord with Dr.
Koch, and agree that lupus, consumption of the throat,
and the early stages of consumption can be successfully
dealt with.
Notwithstanding this exceedingly modest pro-
clamation, the fact remains that, according to the
best possible authorities —i.e., the consensus of
expert scientific opinion in the representative
medical journals of, all countries —Dr. Koch’s
specific in consumption, whether early or advanced,
is just about as big an uncertainty as was Browri-
Sequard’s alleged Elixir of Life When it was first
propounded. It is* for instance, not at all certaih
that the man into whose system tuberculine is
injected does not run the risk of being hopelessly
poisoned.

pockets. Apropos, it is related that a certain
well-known bookmaker having been informed not
long ago that “ the push ’’intended to relieve him

worth 12s. fid. Sure enough they stole the bogus
watch, and at the following meeting it was thrown
in his face with—“ Take that for ’avin’ us !”

At a meeting of the Sydney Ladies’ Sani-
tary Association the other day one dame asserted
that ladies did not recognise shop-girls as being
of the same flesh and blood as themselves, whereat
the Presidentess became somewhat indignant.
The Bulletin is afraid that the average lady does
not for an instant admit occupying the same posi-
tion, either in the sight of God or of the physiolo-
gist, as the young “person” who pulls down all
the goods in the store before she buys sixpenn’orth
of ribbon. “ Ladies,” by the way, are not made
of flesh and blood at all nowadays, but of cotton-
wool and newspapers—so we have heard it alleged.
Then the meeting went onto discuss Cremation,
which one lady said was “all very well for
garbage, out not tor human beings.” Apropos, a
French friend the other day told us that at Nancy
some months ago a young lady, the daughter of a
friend of his youth, gave him some flowers, say-
ing : “ As you know, the remains of my poor
mother were cremated and, in accordance with
her will, buried in our old garden. In compliance
with her request that should she not see you before
she died, you were to be given some flowers grown
on the place fertilised by her ashes, I now hand
you this little bouquet.”

A New York paper claims that Mrs.

of any woman in Australia whose feet quite rise
to this degree of perfection, but there is at least
one newspaper proprietor about here whose ear
must be considerably arched, for he could get a
good-sized egg into it without injuring the article,
or spilling the yolk into his brain. Also, this
country keeps well ahead in another branch of
beauty, for it contains several prominent citizens
whose legs ate arched to such an extent that not
only an egg, but the ostricli that laid it, could
escape between them without any damage;

What tile saved aboriginal learns about
the Gospel isn’t much, but his knowledge of
liquor is copious, and he is filled with information
about tobacco; There was once in the Northern
Territory a meek expounder who did much good
work, for he used to give rum to the nigger who
had been brought into the fold, while the nigger
who was still in the bond of sin and the gall of
iniquity got no rum, and was allowed to parch.
Consequently there was more Christianity in that
tribe than was ever heard of before—until this
particular expounder was recalled and another
sent up in his place; The day after the new
preacher arrived a gaunt sinner stalked up and
remarked abruptly: “Abraham, Jacob, Job,
Jonah, Galilee!” “What?” asked the teacher.
“Isaac, hell, Beelzebub, Judah, Moses, damn!”
added the black visitor, confidentially. “ What
do you mean?” Availed the bearer of good tidings.
And then the stranger threw aside the veil of
metaphor, and responded, in a voice of thunder :
“ I mean—rum !”

One Warland died in N.S. Wales in 1859,

marvellous how soon things were forgotten in

satire on the utility of jDenal servitude in Austra-

The modern British regulation tvkvdh ex-

the death of the culprit open to doubt, is not quite
devoid of meaning. One of these days a duke, ot
other exalted personage, may commit a cold

say—“ May it please your Grace, the sentence of

reporters will be there to see it done, and may the

this myrmidon will wake up with a fearful head
on him, and be informed that he did his work so
nicely that His Grace has left him £5OO in his
will. “ I suppose I must have fainted away after
turning of the nobleman off?” the executioner will
suggest in a tone of enquiry. To which the
sheriffs, gaol-chaplain, governor, head-warder and
others will reply that the dear Duke
30ft. with a sickening thud, when a convulsive
tremor of the limbs told that his spirit had gone
to meet its Maker. Whereupon, the executioner
will bank his five ’underd quid, and somebody
uncommonly like the dear dook will spend the
rest of his days in doing the continong. The Law
is not such a fool as it sometimes looks.

“ In connection with the recent murder of a woman at
Whitechapel some important discoveries have already
been made wdiioh tend to proVe that the seaman named
Saddler, who has been arrested, was the perpetrator of
the crime, and, moreover, that he is identical with the
notorious Jack the Ripper.” —Cable.
“The private papers of Saddler have been examined by
the police authorities and show that he was absent from
England at the time at which several of the murders were
perpetrated by Jack the Ripper.”-
CABLE.
INSULTING BEHAVIOUR.
The bobby he paces his daily beat
In a sorrowful, castdOwn mood,
0 ! sad is the tread of his large, flat feet;
And his sturamick refuses food,
His brow’s o’ershadowed with clouds of doubt
As his nails he gently gnaws
He is wondering what he will do without
The “ insulting behaviour ” clause.
It covered all crimes that an erring race
Can ever commit on earth,
If a boy walked out with a swollen face
Or a body deformed from birth ;
Or a man looked mad, or a girl seemed odd;
Then Bobby was glad, because
Ho bundled the lot of ’em off to “ quod ”
On “insulting behaviour ” clause;
When a person “ took ill ” in a public place
Dear Bobby rolled up, you bet!
To tell him it wasn’t a criminal case*
. Or, anyways, not as yet;
But if he got worse and was aWful sick;
Then Bobby’s big grimy paws
Laid hold of the sufferer bloomin’ quick*
On “insulting behaviour ” clause.
But Bobby he heaves an onion sigh
(The tint of elephant’s breath)
As he mops the tear from his small red eye
And gloomily thinks of death ;
For what is the good of the “ traps ” or “ d.’s”
If they cannot employ their jaws
In swearing the charge is whatever you please*
On “ insulting behaviour ” clause ?
OLD JACK COMES “HOME” AGAIN.
Old Jack the Ripper’s “home” again*
The beast is caught once more;
Upon his hands they’ve found the stain
Of some young Avoman’s gore.
The interest in Strikes and things
Begins of late to Wane,
And now the Cable Liar sings
That Jack’s come “ home again—
Old Jack comes “ home ” again,
Old Jack comes ‘ 1 home ” again—
When business flags with daily rags
Old Jack comes “home ” again.
When Bismarck and the Parnell case
Are growing flat and stale,
And of a British peer’s disgrace
We get no spicy tale :
When folks are “ full ” of Stanley and
The Infant King of Spain,
Another East End crime is planned,
So Jack comes “ home ” again—
Old Jack comes “home’’again,
Old Jack comes “ Lome ” again—
We want fresh fibs about “ his nibs,”
So J ack comes “ home ” again.
He serves a purpose just as long
As edf-tors desire,
And then we find the news was wrong
Which set our brains afire ;
We shake our heads and sadly smile—
Alas ! it is too plain
The weary world must wait awhile
Ere Jack comes “home’’again—
Ere Jack comes “ home ” again,
Ere Jack comes “home” again,
When trade is slack they fetch him back,
And Jack comes “home” again.

Citizens' Life Assurance Company
(Limited.)
ANNUAL MEETING.
The fourth annual general meeting of the Citizens’
Life Assurance Co. was held at the offices, 21 to
25 Castlereagh-street, on Wednesday, 11th Feb.
6here was a very large attendance, and great in-
terest was taken in the proceedings. Mr. J. P.
Garvan, M.P., managing-director, occupied the
chair.
Ihe directors’ annual report showed satisfac-
toiy results, in spite of the drawbacks inseparable
to the transaction of business with wage-earners
during the late strike. The number of policies
issued during the year had been 65,595. The
total income of the company was £73,284 15s. 5d.,
an increase for the 12 months of £21,166 9s, lOd
The amount paid in claims was £4968 3s. Id.;
under 722 policies. The assurance fund, with
paid-up capital, now amounted to £73,674 3s. 9d.
showing an.increase of £22,675 11s. 9d. during the
year. The annual premium income on the poli-
cies in force on 31st December, 1890, amounted to
£90,531 7s. sd. During the year operations
had been extended to Tasmania, and West
Australia. The Perth office was under
the charge of Mr. Charles F. Eveston, and the
Launceston office under the management of
Mr. Adam C. Bell. Allusion was made to the
demise of Mr. Columbus Rochfort, resident secre-
tary in South Australia, and to the appointment
of Mr. P. J. O’Driscoll as his successor. The
directors recommended a dividend of 10 per cent-
on the paid-up capital. Dr. J. J. Power and
Messrs. S. S. Hyam and J. P. Garvan retired
fiom the directorate, but offered themselves for
re-election. Messrs. James C. Bayley and
Andrew M'Guire retired as auditors, but also
offered themselves for re-election.
The balance-sheet disclosed, outside the items
mentioned in the report, that the actual amount-
paid in premiums (no re-assurances) during the
year was £70,852 19s. Id. The expenses included
£11,365 Is. 4d. paid as commission on collections
of old policies, and £16,405 ss. on account of the
introduction of new business. The “expenses of
management,” separately itemised stalled
£15,645 15s. lid.
The Chairman, after a few preliminary remarks
in moving the adoption of the report and balance-
sheet, said When at our last annual meet-
ing I announced that we had issued over 57,00()
policies during the year, a number far outstripping
the results of any previous year of this office, and
also of any other office in Australia, it was thought
that it was an exceptional achievement, and would,
not be repeated for the year 1890.
I am pleased to state that these predictions l
have not been verified, for we issued from January
1 to December 31, 1890, no less than 65,59 r,,
policies, thus exceeding the number of the previous
year by over 8000.
Of course, our figures will scarcely stand com-
parison with those of densely-inhabited countries,-
where population is so closely packed that the can-
vasser for new business will find an average of over-
-300 persons in every square mile of the country
whilst in Australia, with its vast area and'
scattered population, you only have an average of
jess than two persons to each square mile of our
territory. Our revenue for the year exceeds that:
of the previous year by £21,166, and we have-
added to the funds £22,675, thus giving us a reserve'
of £73,674. In moving the adoption of the last
annual report I showed you the position we-
occupied amongst the great industrial life assur..
ance offices of the British dominions, and in no-
point at that time brought under review have we-
receded from the position we then had won, but
on the other hand we have accentuated our posi-
tion under every heading. And in the most im.
portant point of comparison—the percentage of
income saved—we hold the premier position
amongst the industrial life offices of the world.
This large proportion of savings, well invested at-
good interest in the earlier years of our existence-
will prove a tower of strength to us in the years:
to come. Economy in expenditure and a liberal
interpretation of our obligations to our assured
members are the corner-stones of our structure
(“ hear, hear ”)—the justification and the reason
of our success. The great object of this institu-
tion has been to provide funds for the family
where sickness and death have entered. In the-
largo number of assured members we have
naturally to meet many calls of this kind::
yet it gives me pleasure to say that,
owing to the care of our agents, inspectors and
superintendents, our mortality has been 40 per
cent, less than amongst the general population
As for claims, they arose under 722 policies, in
amount £4968 3s. Id., and were all settled withi
the promptitude that distinguishes this office,
and though the average value of the claims:
were small, yet the amounts in the aggre
gate were large, and their prompt disburse-
ment became a source of general benefit. Thus,
from the Citizens’ Life Assurance Co., with its
head offices in the mother colony, there has flown
■out to its members in distress in equal ratio,
whether in Now South Wales or Victoria, Queens-
land or South Australia, Tasmania or that latest
-child of our constitutional realm, West Australia,
the beneficent gift of life assurance to its members:
>n their hour of need ; thus blending in a perfect
federation the whole of the Australian colonies,
each with its own resident secretary, medical
-officers, agents, inspectors and superintendents-
and perfect autonomous control within each
coHiy, subject only to such general rules as may
belaid down by tin directors freely chosen from
ainong.-t the shareholders from time to time, and
we have shareholders in every colony of Australia
Dealing with policies, wo have issued ov< t
‘65.000 during the year. New South Wales.^
led the figures, but in Victoria our esteemed
Secretary, Mr. W. N. Dewar, ran the parent
colony close in the amount of business done. In
Queensland, under the secretaryship of Mr.
Joseph Butler, our expectations have been realised,
although business has been hampered by the
Stamp Act, which makes no provision for policies
of under £lOO in value, and thus taxes the humble
citizens who cannot afford to take large policies.
This injustice, however, was more the result of
oversight than of a desire to hamper the
lowly or interfere with the operations of
a growing industrial business, and Sir Thomas
MTlwraith therefore intends to alter the law
at an early date. In South Australia, busi-
ness lias been retarded by the lamented death
of Mr. Columbus Rochfort, the Resident Secre-
tary, one of the most indefatigable workers, and
one of the ablest and most successful officers of
the company. Mr. Rochfort was only in the posi-
tion of resident secretary for something under two
years, and at the time of his death left a widow
and two children unprovided for. But I have th®
pleasure of stating to you that the directors of
this office, which Mr. Rochfort served so well,
have made the care of his children their
special duty—(cheers)—of providing liberally for
educational purposes till the boy is capable
of entering the office staff as a cadet. The
vacancy has been filled by the appointment
of Mr. P. J. O’Driscoll. During the year
we have extended our operations to Tasmania,
under the management of Mr. A. C. Bell, and
made the necessary deposit of £5OOO with th®
Government of that island. We have also invested
£lO,OOO in West Australia, where our progress
may be for a time slow. Two of our directors—
Dr. Power and Mr. Hyam—without any charge
for their time or trouble, specially visited that
colony for the purpose of making as wise an in-
vestment as possible, and I am glad to inform you
that a remunerative investment was made, and
one that promises a substantial increas®
to the funds of the company. Therefore, I
think we may be said, from our standpoint,
to have completed the federation of Austra-
lia, or, at all events, added a strengthening
tie to the growing feeling of Nationality.
Returning to the subject of mortality and ou r
small percentage of deaths, the care of and judg-
ment of our staff is made evident when I tell you
that the mortality experience of all the great
industrial life offices of England corresponds very
closely with the mortality experience of the
Registrar-General of that country, while a striking
proof of the sagacity, care, and judgment of our
medical and canvassing staff in the selection and
admission of proponents is afforded by the fact
that the mortality tables of our office show a ratio
of 40 per cent, less than the mortality experience
of the entire population during the same period.
Turning to other matters, I need only say that,
notwithstanding our increase of expenditure in
making extension of business, we have saved and
invested 30'94 per cent, out of our gross income
for the year. This, too, in spite of the fact that
our rates of remuneration are, in most cases, 50-
per cent, higher than in England, and in some
•cases over 100 per cent. more. Our rate of interest
has improved each year, and our investments at
the close of last year were producing an interest
•of nearly 6 per oent., an amount considerably in
■excess of the rate of interest on which our tables
■of rates are based, and as our funds are growing
rapidly, this will afford no inconsiderable item of
profit.
In our first year, viz., 1887, we added to ou r
funds £4219; in 1888, £7628; in 1889, £16,335;
and in 1890, £22,789. Our insurance fund at th e
•close of last year amounted to £53,674 3s. 9d.,
•exclusive of the share capital. Our revenue for
the year showed the substantial increase of 37 per
•cent, on the previous year, and we augmented our
assurance fund by £22,675 during the year. This
must be deemed extremely satisfactory, especially
in view of the disastrous strike, which tried the
resources and elasticity of the country to the
utmost. In this connection it may be pointed out
that every month we pay claims, small and large,
in every colony of Australia and in almost every
■district of every colony during the course of a
year.
You will notice in our balance-sheet the item
■“ Balance purchase price City Mutual industrial
business, £7975.” Now, this item represents a por.
tion of the cost of the business, and to-day, taking
our business as a whole, it is a very much more
valuable asset than the above amount, and which f
according to some competent authorities, we would
■on purely commercial grounds be justified in
writing at its present value. However, we have
•determined to subject ourselves to the severest
discipline in dealing with such items, and we are
•of opinion that this being a non-revenue produc-
ng asset, as also the item “ Registration fees,
'Tasmania,” which stands in the same category, it
ishould be written off. But as we have now entered
upon our quinquennial year, at the close of which
a searching actuarial valuation will take place,
and also as our investments in freehold property
have increased in value to a greater extent than
the amount of these non-productive assets, we
have decided to let them both remain untouched
until we make our quinquennial valuation at the
■end of the present year. And to give the fullest
■confidence to shareholders and policy-holders I
may state that it has been determined by the
board of directors that the actuarial valuation
will be entrusted to as able a member of the
actuarial profession as can be procured.
At our last annual meeting I had the pleasure
■of announcing to you that the Railway Commis-
sioners of this colony had approved of the office a 8
one in which employes may insure their lives. I
have now also to inform you that the Railway
Commissioners of Victoria have admitted us to
the same privileges in that colony.
Let me remind you that before we could do
business in Victoria, wo had to deposit £5OOO with
the Government as a security for our policy
holders and in proof of our hona-fides; in South
Australia we had to deposit £5OOO ; in Tasmania,
£5OOO ; and in West Australia, £lO,OOO. In New
South Wales alone, there is rib reasonable protec-
tion for policy-holders, thus inviting the opera-
tions of the insurance welsher, who has more
than once plied his vocation. Even in England
this company would not be allowed to transact
business except oil the condition of first depositing
£20,000 with the Government. Why, then, should
this colony hesitate any longer about imposing
such necessary legislation? I may state that we
had a distinct promise from the Government last
session that they would endeavour to pass a bill
dealing with the subject, but I regret that effect
was not given to that promise, and I now express
the hope that it will be amonst the first measures
introduced, and it is sure of a favourable reception
from both sides of the House, and would, if wisely
framed, be easily passed into law.
In a special manner I would wish to acknow-
ledge the able and valuable services of our chief
medical officer, Dr. M. J. Clune, also Dr.
Graham, of Balmain, and Dr. Wood, of Ashfield,
and Dr. Ludlow, of Newcastle, also Dr. Sandford,
of Melbourne, Dr. Hynes, of Adelaide, and Dr.
Lucas and Dr. Southam, of Brisbane, Dr. Pyke,
of Launceston, Dr. Crowther, of Hobart, and
Dr. Jamieson, of Perth, West Australia, and also
of our indefatigable secretary, Mr. W. A. Smith.
To these gentlemen and all the members of the
staff I tender the best thanks of the Board. One
and all as officers and soldiers in a great army—
from Queensland and New South Wales, Victoria
and Tasmania, South Australia and West Aus-
tralia —all have worked harmoniously and earnestly
and ably to realise the best results from our com-
plete federation of the Australian colonies. We
did not lack advisers who strongly urged us to
confine our operations to one colony, where with
more perfect supervision we could hope for better
commercial results than by spreading ourselves
over the whole of the colonies. lam glad to say
that almost from every point of view the wisdom
of embracing the whole of the colonies in our
insurance federation has been made manifest. A
policy-holder who, from whatever cause, finds it
necessary to remove from one colony to another
finds himself at once associated’ with thousands of
policy-holders—even in West Australia we have
considerably over a thousand policy-holders.
(“Hear, hear.”) The resident secretary, with
large means of information at his command, takes
special interest in such cases, and the resident of
one colony insured in this office, the circumstances
of whose life necessitates his removing to another
colony, lands there, not as a stranger amongst
strangers, but as an Australian citizen welcomed
by Australian citizens.
After a few remarks on federation and the grow-
ing spirit of nationalism, Mr. Garvan moved the
adoption of the fourth annual report and balance-
sheet. This was seconded by Mr. J. Curley.
M.P. ; and after Messrs. G. Crowley, W.
J. Lvne, M.P., Alderman M’Neill, Dr.
Power; S. H. Hyam, C. F. Garvan, J. W.
Ellis, M’Guire, H. Mahon, F. B. Freeh ill, F,
Coffee, and Secretary Smith had spoken and Dr.
.1. J. Power, Messrs. S. H. Hyam, J.P., and .1.
P. Garvan, M.P., had been elected unanimously
directors, and Messrs. J. C. Bayley and Andrew
M’Guire re-elected auditors, business was con-
cluded.
On reading this report one cannot fail to be
struck by the manner in which the democracy of
Australia have gladly recognised the fact that in
he Citizens’ Life Assurance Company, they have
found a medium for making provision for the
future of those riear and dear to them, in the event
of an accident, by the substruction of a small sum
from weekly earnings. It is an easy matter for
the worker to disburse a few pence weekly in the
hope of some great prospective benefit to
those he loves; whereas, when it becomes
necessary to hand over approximately the
same sum by monthly payment, the task
is almost impossible of accomplishment. As
far as may be understood by those who have
not been admitted into the arcana of live assur-
ance business, the elements are of the simplest.
It is necessary first in the calculation of premiums
to take into consideration the rate of interest
likely to accrue from investment, the mortality
returns, and the proportion to be added to the net
rates to pay working expenses and yield a profit
to the insurer. All these conditions, with the
minor elements arising from them, have been
amply fulfilled by those who have drawn up the
constitution of the Citizens’ Life Assurance Com-
pany, and the result is that premiums are taken at
the lowest possible rates, while the low death-
rate - enables the society to hand over high
returns to its shareholders. Such a company
in a democratic community must inevitably grow
in a ratio proportionate ’to the growth of the
land in which it is established, a growth to
which there is practically no boundaries and no
limit, these having been removed by the institu-
tion of what Mr. Garvan styles “insurance
federation.” That was, indeed, a very wise and
statesmanlike idea, likely not only to benefit
the whole community from an insurance point of
view, and the society financially, but to exercise
a great influence, like many other forces, in
welding together in social, political and economic
homogeneity the heterogenity of the Australian
provinces. This may seem a high-flown statement,
but community of interests involves unity of object,
the interchange of ideas, in some cases antagon-
istic, means in time mental assimilation, a paring
'away of rough edges and a toning down of
elements apparently chaotic and incongruous into
a perfect harmony of conception, and expression.
Such a society as the Citizens’ therefore may
be fitly said to represent a thread in the
great cable of common interests, national aspira-
tions and democratic tendency that is yearly draw-
ing the widely separated units of Australia into
the closest harmony. How long it may be
before national federation is accomplished,
we know not; when it comes the- Citizens’
Life Assurance Company can fairly claim
to have had a great share in the result.
The national independence of Australia, as Mr.
Garvan so ably pointed out, is to be won, not by
aggression, not by carrying the banner of war and
rapine into other lands, but by a peaceful subju-
gation of the virgin soil, a development of natural
resources, a welding together of a free people for
defensive purposes and amalgamation in the
peaceful pursuits of commerce, pastoralism, indus-
trialism, and agriculture. On all these depart-
ments the ramifications of the Citizens’ have
laid hold, and its share and policy holders
have the gratification of knowing that they
are not only working in the great cause of
humanity, but assisting to lay the foundations
whereon will presently rest the bulwarks of a
mighty nation, second to none in the peaceful
arts and in the intelligence, comfort and happi-
ness of her residents. In fact, the officers of the
citizens in their house-to-house search for policy-
holders throughout every corner of the vast
continent, . and their ' weekly collection of
premiums, may be looked on as the missionaries,
or at least pioneers, of the coming federation
movement.
Victorian Racing.
The Australian Cup, usually a good thing for
the horse that starts first favourite, is, at time of writing,
an open race on “paper.” Before next Tuesday after-
noon, however, the list of possible winners will be thinned
down to half-a-dozen names at most, and even now it
would be “ good business,” as betting goes, to'bet boldly
that a three-year-old annexes the stake, or to take odds
that youngsters fill all the places. Such horses as Riche-
lieu, Vengeance, Whakawai, The Serf, Jebusite, Escut-
cheon, Lottie, and Cooramin have no sort of paper
chance to win a fast-run race over two-and-a-quarter
miles. Chintz will have to be vastly changed from the
weary-looking animal of last November to be worth
serious consideration (albeit, March is the mares’ month),
and Highborn, on the weight-for-age scale, has all the
worst of the handicap with Correze, Enuc, The Admiral,
and others who were not far behind the five-year-old
“ surprise ”in the Melbourne Cup. All the same, High-
born’s prospects are fairly improved by the win of Mal-
volio, at Caulfield, last Saturday, and, taking a line
through the latter, Mr. Oatley’s horse holds Tantallon
quite_ safe. This by the way. Only one can win,
and if—as the writer makes out to his own satis-
faction at this hopeful period— a young horse is to win
nothing remains but to find out ivhich juvenile looks least
likely to drop a punter’s sovereign down the sink-hole of
rash investments. The writer has some sort of grounds
for believing that The Admiral is not at his very best
just now, and there are solid public reasons for maintain-
ing that Megaphone, who has been ridden by Ramage as
though his heart were not yet in the right place, ought
to finish behind Enuc. To suppose that Megaphone is
better than Enuc at the weights is to,suppose that he
could have won the Caulfield Cup with 7st. lllbs. up, and
to reckon him a far superior horse to The Admiral, who
failed to give Enuc sixteen pounds in the Melbourne Cup.
Correze, to the writer’s way of thinking, is as well worth
backing as Megaphone, and would seem the pick of the
handicap but for the undoubted fact that Enuc has im-
proved more (to the eye) since November than any horse
in Australia. Both of these consistent performers out-
stayed Greygown in the V.R.C. Handicap of If miles, and
Spot, Gatling, Whimbrel, &c., in the Melbourne Cup,
when all were going their hardest for the money. We
take, then, Megaphone (just able to do Crown Jewel on
their Spring running), Correze and Enuc as the best of
the field, and Enuc, who will, all going well, start first
favourite as the best of those three. But if Enuc goes
wrong before the day, or isn’t backed by the stable after
all, or doesn’t run—well, in either or all of those cases
this nailing good horse might as well be a lame donkey
for punting purposes.
» * #
Caulfield meeting, in accordance with ancient
custom, left its patrons swearing to give that sandy
desert “best” for the future. Not one favourite got
home, and not one winner had any' backers worth men-
tioning. It is even doubtful whether the Oakleigh
Handicap can be regarded as a public trial for the New-
market, because horses which break their faithful
adherents at Caulfield are apt to taunt those unfortunates
with their idiocy by winning at Flemington when only'
the stable is “on.” Yet it is best to accept public
running in simple faith, anyway, and to hope that if
Clonard, Gladstone, Victor Hugo, Little Bob, In-
vestigator, Ginger, Portland, or Toastmaster should win
next Saturday’s race the stewards will want to know what
somebody means by it. For all the horses named were
badly beaten in the Oakleigh.
# * #
Of the placed ones, Wild Rose (penalised 141b5.)
and Radoo are in the Newmarket Handicap, and their
chances are not worth backing. One would want to know
a lot more than the writer can get a hint of before putting
a penny on three-fourths of the horses engaged, many of
whom could not he handicapped into winning a race in
which weight goes for very little. Of those under the Bst.
mark, Newton, Utter, Lady Lovel and Gaudy make a bit
of a show on paper, or are well spoken of by people who
understand turf business. On the principle, however,
that you must find a “flyer ” to win the great sprint race
of the year, it is safest to look amongst the horses that
have already' flown in public, making exception only in
favour of any “dark” one that takes the fancy of capable
judges. Marvel has a claim to respect on'this score.
Plenty of people, who regard this sensational “ mystery”
as very badly handicapped on form, think him good
enough to win easily. Marvel looks and gallops at
exercise like a clinker. Yet as much can be said for Ben-
digo, who has, in Hickenbotham’s opinion, been vastly
improved since he made such a brilliant dash at Teksum
in the Railway Stakes on Melbourne Cup-day. Greygown
may show up (and prominently) on Saturday, so may
half a score of others, but to the writer it seems that Ben-
digo is the one horse certain to go fast on the day if his
present state of health continues, and with the Donald
Wallace colours up, certain to give punters a good bit of
sport for their money—if they must try to lose it. Some
weeks ago, when the Newmarket and Australian Cup
weights first appeared, The Bulletin drew special atten-
tion to Enuc and Bendigo, without worrying over a small
army of animals that have since paid forfeit, or brought
contempt upon the prophets who drivelled about the
chances they never possessed. Which is a little some-
thing to blow about, all things considered.
Whimbrel and Crown Jewel will be worth fol-
lowing in any of the minor handicaps at the V.R.C.
meeting.
If punting down at Flemington
Should any man intend to go,
He might do worse than “dash it on’
A decent horse like Bendigo ;
And should he chance to get a win
(Which, by the way, would be luck)
He might do worse than back some “ tin,"
And leave the rest on Enuc.

UIMPEACH ABLE TESTIMONY.
Facts are established by testimony. This is so,
not only in laws of business and right, but also in
social life. But while the importance of evidence
is thus everywhere acknowledged, its weight is
purely dependent upon the character of the
witnesses. Unimpeachable testimony is therefore
what is wanted. Upon this principle the follow-
ing names are presented to the public as being
those of parties who, having experienced or
observed the effectsfof the great German remedy,
St. Jacobs oil, accord it their hearty endorse-
ments :—
The Right Rev. Bishop Gilmour, Cleveland,
Ohio : “ Excellent for rheumatism and kin-
dred diseases. It has benefited me greatly.”
Hon. Ed. Salomon, Ex-Gov. Washington Ter.,
San Francisco, Cal. : “My cure of severe
rheumatism and lameness by St. Jacob’s oil
was instantaneous.”
Prof. Tice, the renowned meteorologist, St.
Louis, Mo. : “Almost instant relief from
excruciating pain.”
Mine. Marie Salvotti, Prima Donna Wilhelmj
Concert Troupe: “Nothing can compare
with it as a prompt and reliable cure for the
ailments nalned.”
Wm. H. Waremg, Esq., Asst. Genl. Supt.
Third Division Mailing: and Distributing
Dept. New York Post-office : “ Proved
equal to all that is claimed for the oil, and
found efficacious. Ready relief for rheu-
matic complaints.”
Hon. Thomas L. James, Postmaster, New
York : “ Referring to Supt. Wareing’s
report, concerning St. Jacobs oil, ‘ I con-
cur.’”
Professor C. O. Duplessis, Manager Chicago,
111., Gymnasium : “Our professionals and
amateurs use it in preference to everything
we know of or have ever tried.”
Geo. W. Walling, Esq., Supt. Police, New
York City : “ Members of this Dept,
relieved of Rheumatism by its use.”
Hon. Leonard Swett, the Great Lawyer of the
North-west, Chicago, 111. ; “Certainly the
best remedy of the kind I have ever known.”
Capt. Paul Boyton, the World-renowned Swim-
mer : “ I do not see how I could get along
without St. Jacobs oil.”
M. V. B. Hersom, Esq. (Pinkham and Hersqm),
Boston, Mass. : “After spending vainly
five hundred dollars for other remedies, I
have no hesitation in declaring that St.
Jacobs oil will cure neuralgia.”
Stacey Hill, Esq., Mt. Auburn Inclined Plane
Railway, Cincinnati, Ohio : “Undoubtedly
it is a remarkable medicine.”
TO THEIR CREDIT BE IT SAID.
That Australians generally are not slow to
recognise a genuinely good article —whatever form
it may take—is a fairly well-established fact.
Nor does it redound less to their credit that when-
ever special merit is perceived by them they are
not slower in freely acknowledging it, and giving
it such support as may lay in their power. The
Waterbury Watch Company receives from day to
day dozens of testimonials from wearers of their
watches in all parts of the colonies —a fact very
gratifying to their endeavours to place reliable
timekeepers at a price within the reach of all.
The following are samples recently received : —
Mr. Thomas G. M’Guire writes from Nyngan,
N.S.W. : “I am well pleased with the Water-
bury as a good, cheap watch, costing very little
for repair. If 1 had taken as much care of the
Waterbury as I have taken over other watches, it
would not have had to be repaired so soon. How-
ever, it has acted admirably under the circum-
stances, and pleased me very much.”
Ohas. J. N, Horstey, Esq., J.P., O.P.S.,
Mudgee, N.S.W., writes under date; “I have
much pleasure in stating that my Waterbury
watch is, without exception, one of the best
watches I have ever owned, although I have had
many more expensive. It is a reliable and ex-
cellent timekeeper.”
AT A TRIFLING COST
you can obtain a Waterbury Watch, which rarely
gets out of order, and never constitutes itself a
permanent tax on the owner. In the event of
injury befalling it, by taking or sending it to the
Company’s Repair Depot, 56 Margaret-street, it
can be efficiently repaired at a nominal cost,
ranging, according to the extent of damage, frohi
6d to 2s 6d, but never exceeding the latter amount
unless by mutual consent.
The genuine Waterbury may be obtained from
any respectable storekeeper or dealer. Price,
series “E” (the cld favourite), 13s. (id. ; series
“J” or “L” (the new marvels), with enamelled
dials, 22s. 6d. each.

Land Company of Australasia, Limited.
Amongst the various institutions which in these
colonies have undertaken the semi-governmental
duty of opening up land for settlement in small
areas, one of the most remarkable instances of
rapid advance is to be found in the Land Company
of Australasia, a presentment of whose head
office, in Pitt Street, Sydney, is published in this
issue. This corporation first became an established
fact in 1885, and so energetic has been the manage-
ment, and so judicious the selection of lands for
disposal, that already its position financially is
thoroughly assured. The scope of the Company’s
operations is a very wide one, embracing the
purchase of large freehold estates, for the purpose
of subdivision and sale to small selectors as farms,
orchards and building allotments, and the assist-
ance of those who settle upon the land in various
ways. In this direction, success has in every way
crowned the efforts of the management from the
outset, and the Company has been the means of
placing within easy grasp of large numbers of
farmers, with small capital, some of the splendid
land in the two colonies of New South Wales and
Victoria, which had hitherto been locked up in
large estates. Amongst these may be mentioned
the famous Glenormiston estate, near Terang, in
Victoria, and the Segenhoe and Ravensworth
estates in the Hunter River district of this colony,
which, from being large and comparatively unpro-
ductive tracts of country
in the possession of a few
individuals, are rapidly
being converted into
pretty, thriving farms
and orchai’ds, which, in
some instances, have en-
tirely changed the ap-
pearance of the localities.
The modus operandi of
the company, iu this
connection, is somewhat
novel. Instead of merely
throwing open the land
for purchase on easy
terms—which, of course,
is one portion of their
business —an effort is
made by scir-.itific in-
vestigation to place in
the hands of selectors
that class of country
which is most suited to
their requirements. Thus
an analysis is made of
the various classes of soil
to be found on different
parts of the estates, and
those areas which arc
deemed suitable for
arboriculture are reserved
and frequently planted
as orchards, while the
balance is classed off as
being adapted for the
growth of this or that
description o' crop. It
is held that in too many
instances farmers take
up land with a view to
growing a certain class of
cereals or roots with-
out considering the
question of its adapta-
bility, and as a natural
result it very frequently
happens that they are
disappointed, and attri-
bute to the poorness of
the soil a defect which is
due to their own lack
of knowledge. At the
offices of the company
are now to be seen samples
of the various soils to be
found on the Segenhoe
Estate which, though
varying in their con-
stituent elements, are all
well adapted for certain
classes of cultivation.
Another important step
which is taken is to
assist as far as possible
the young settler, by pre-
Earing his selection for
im by means of the
planting of fruit and other trees to which
the soil is adapted. By this means, upon
his taking possession, perhaps two or three
years afterwards, he is enabled to con-
serve his slender capital. Many of the neces-
sary improvements are also thus all ready to his
hand, and instead of having to wait years before
his land becomes reproductive, he is enabled to
place his produce upon the market almost im-
mediately and reap a profit. But this does not
oonstituteeverything. The enterprising managing-
directors, Messrs. W. Harris, J. G. Edwards, and
G. B. Walker, who are all practical men, are con-
stantly looking about for some method of im-
proving the land at their disposal, and are already
seeking powers from Parliament to obtain
water for irrigation purposes on their Segenhoe
estate. Then there are the Gore Hill brick-
works which are the property of the Com-
pany, including the Hoffman kiln, and which
are proving to be a highly remunerative
investment. There are likewise many other
methods of turning the Company’s property to
account, which it is impossible to enumerate in t lie
space at disposal, such as the planting of vine-
yards and wine-making on co-operative principles
by the settlers on various portions of the estates,
the establishment of co-operative dairy companies,
and so on ; in which the funds will be first pro-
vided by the Company, to be afterwards repaid
out of profits. Perhaps the greatest stroke of
policy yet adopted by the directors, however, is
the initiation of a scheme for the opening of
agencies and branches in Great Britain through
which monies for investment can be received, and
intending settlers may obtain all the information
necessary to take up suitable farms before arrival,
and proceed to work at once. Mr. Walker, one
of the Managing Directors, is now in England,
carrying out the idea, and so far every success has
attended his efforts.
Turning to the financial status of the Company,
an analysis of its affairs is likely to prove very
interesting, as showing how, by judicious invest-
ment in real estate, a sound position may be built
up in a short space of time. The balance-sheet
for the half-year ending 31st December, shows
that there was a balance to the credit of profit
and loss of £11,443 18s. lid. (out of which, after
paying a dividend of 10 per cent., £(>2oo was
carried forward); while the reserve fund showed
a credit of £47,417 10s.; and the suspense account
a credit of £32,202 13s. The issue of shares lias
been throughout highly satisfactory, and the
Company are now taking such further action as
will at once place them in a very foremost position
amongst the great financial corporations of Aus-
tralia. The first issue of 20,000 £lO shares was
taken up in the colonies, and a similar issue in
London was equally successful. Following that a
. second issue of. 10,000 shares was made in Lon-
don at a premium of £1 a share, which went off
successfully and placed a sum of £IO,OOO at
once to the credit of the Reserve fund. In
addition, debentures which were placed on the
market at 41 and 5 per cent, have been almost
entirely taken up. It is next proposed to increase
the capital by a special issue of 40,000 fully paid-
up £5 shares, at a premium of £2 10s., on which
there is to be a guaranteed dividend of 7J per
cent. The effect of this move would be to in-
crease the paid-up capital by £200,000, bringing
the subscribed capital up to £700,000, and to
carry £IOO,OOO to the Reserve fund, which, it will
be seen at a glance, would place the Company in
a very strong position. This issue was expected
to be floated iu London, on Exchange, before the
brokers, this week.

A late “blackleg” writes to say that the
shipowners have grossly failed to carry out their
vehement promises (made during the keenness of
the big strike) that they would stick to those men
who then went to their rescue. Our correspondent,
who shipped as a seaman, was discharged from
his vessel at a moment’s notice, in order to make
room for a. union man, although his discharge was
of too hit'll '«t order of merit, thus showing that
he hail n t In i n “ ;.-ached ” for incompetency. He
also tells iu the experience of a man with 20
years of excellent character certified to. This
man applied for a vacancy and was told by a ship-
owner that he must get a ticket from the “Free
Labour Bureau.” He did so, and then presented
himself on board the vessel, gaily flourishing his
“ Free Labour ” ticket. But the ship’s officer
looked with scorn upon the apparent “scab,” and
selected a unionist who had no F.L. ticket at all.
Our correspondent’s wailings don’t move us at all.
We foretold what the shipowner would do with
his temporary catspaw so soon as the fight was
over. The employer does not love the unionist,
but it pays him to employ him, and it pays him
still better to keep a grovelling “scab” out of
employment, so that when the unionist strikes,
he may recruit from hungry scab ranks. Whereas,
if he keeps scab-labour employed, and the scabs
should strike, he couldn’t fill the vacancies with
unemployed unionists. These wouldn’t blackleg
at any price.

The Downfall of Mulligan’s.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The sporting men of Mulligan’s were an
exceedingly knowing lot; in | fact, they had
obtained the name amongst their neighbours of
being a little bit too knowing. They had “ taken
down ” the sporting men of the adjoining town
in a variety of ways. They were always winning
maiden-plates with horses which were shrewdly
suspected to be old and well-tried performers in
disguise. When the sports of Paddy’s Flat un-
earthed a phenomenal runner in the shape of a
blackfellovv called Frying-pan Joe, the Mulligan
contingent immediately took the trouble to dis-
cover a blackfellow of their own, and they made a
match and won all the Paddy’s Flat money with
ridiculous ease ; then their blackfellow turned out
to be a well-known Sydney performer. They had
a man who could light, a man who could be
backed to jump five-feet-ten, a man who could
kill eight pigeons out of nine at 30 yards, a man
who could make a break of 50 or so at billiards if
he tried; they could all drink, and they all had
that indefinite look of infinite wisdom and con-
scious superiority which belongs only to those
who know some’thing about horseflesh. They
knew a great many things which they never
learnt at a Sunday-school; at cards and such
things they were perfect adepts; they would go
to immense trouble to work off a small swindle in
a sporting line, and the general consensus of
opinion was that they were a very “ fly ” crowd at
Mulligan’s, and if you went there you wanted to
“ keep your eyes skinned ” or they’d “ have ” you
over a threepenny-bit.
# # *
There were races at Sydney one Christ-
mas, and a chosen and select band of the Mulligan
sportsmen were going down to them. They were
in high feather, having just won a lot of money
from a young Englishman at pigeon-shooting, by
the simple yet ingenious method of slipping
blank cartridges into his gun when he wasn’t
looking, and then backing the bird; also they
knew several dead-certainties for the races. They
intended to make a fortune out of the Sydney
people before they came back, and their ad-
mirers who came to see them off only asked them
as a favour to leave money enough among the
Sydney crowd to make it worth while for another
detachment to go down later on. Just as the
train was departing a priest came running on to
the platform, and was bundled by the porters into
the carriage where our Mulligan friends were, the
door wag slammed to, and away they went. His
reverence was hot and perspiring, and for a few
minutes he mopped himself with a handkerchief,
while the silence was unbroken except by the
rattle of the train.
* • *
After a while one of the Mulligan frater-
nity got out a pack of cards and proposed a game
to while away the time. There was a young
squatter in the carriage who looked as if he might
be induced to lose a few pounds, and the sports-
men thought they would be neglecting their
opportunities if they did not try and “ get a bit to
go on with ” from him. He agreed to play, and,
just as a matter of courtesy, they asked the priest
whether he would take a hand.
“What game d’ye play?” he asked, in a
melodious brogue. They explained that any game
was equally acceptable to them, but they thought
it right to add that they generally played for
money. “ Shure an’ it don’t matter for wanst in
away,”sez he—“ Oi’ll take a hand bedad —I’m
only going about fifty miles, so I can’t lose a for-
tune.” Then they lifted a light portmanteau on
to their knees to make a table, and five of them —
three of the Mulligan’s crowd and the two
strangers—started to have a little game of poker.
Things looked rosy for the Mulligan’s boys, and
they chuckled as they thought how soon they were
making a beginning, and what a magnificent yarn
they would have to tell about how they rooked
the priest on the way down.
* # #
Nothing very sensational resulted from
the first few deals, and the priest began to ask
questions of the others. “Be ye going to the
races ?” he enquired. They said that they were.
“ Ah ! and I suppose ye’ll be betting with these
bookmakers—bettin’ on the horses will yez ! They
do be terrible knowing men, these bookmakers,
they tell me. I wouldn’t bet much if I was ye,”
he said, with an affable smile. “If ye go bettin’
ye will be took in with these bookmakers.” The
boys from Mulligan’s listened with a bored air
and reckoned that by the time they parted the
priest would have learnt that they were well able
to look after themselves. They went steadily on
with the game, and the priest and the young
squatter won slightly ; this was part of the plan
to lead them on to plunge. They neared the
station where the priest was to get out. He had
won something rather more than they liked, and
the signal was passed round to “put the cross
on ” —i.e., to manipulate the hands so as to get
back his winnings and let him go. Poker is a
game at which a man need not risk much unless
he feels inclined, and on this deal the priest chose
not to risk anything and stood out; consequently,
when they drew up at the station he still had a
few pounds of their money. He half rose and
then he said; “Bedad, and I don’t like going
away with yer money. Oi 11 go on to the next
station so as ye can have revinge.” Then he sat
down again, and the play went on in earnest.
* # #
The man of religion seemed to have the
Devil’s own luck. When he was dealt a good
hand he invariably backed it well, and if he had a
bad one he would not risk anything. The sports
grew painfully anxious as they saw him getting
further and further ahead of them, prattling away
and joking all the time like a big schoolboy. The
squatter was the biggest loser so far as they had
got, but the priest was the only winner. All the
others were out of pocket. His I'everence played
witli great dash, and seemed to know a lot
about the game; and when they arrived at the
second station he was in pocket a good round
sum. He rose to leave them, with many expres-
sions of regret at having robbed them of their
money, and laughingly promising full revenge next
time. Just as he was opening the door of the
carriage, one of the Mulligan’s fraternity said in
a stage-whisper: “I thought that was how it
would be. He a s-’nkpocket, and won’t give us
our revenge now. If he can comb this far, let
him come on to Sydney and play for double the
stakes.” The priest heard the remark and turned
quickly round. “Bedad, an’ if that's yer talk,
Oi’ll go on wid yez and play ye fer double stakes
from here to the other side of glory. Play on
now ! Do yez think men are mice because
they eat cheese ? It isn’t one of the Ryans
would be fearing to give any man his revenge!”
He snorted defiance at them, grabbed nis cards
and waded in. The others felt that a crisis was
at hand and settled down to play in a dead silence.
The priest kept on winning steadily. The
gamblers saw that something decisive must be
done, and the leader of the party, the “old man ”
“ The Daddy,” as they put it—decided to make
a big plunge and get all the money back on one
hand. By a dexterous manipulation of the cards,
which luckily was undetected, he dealt himself
four kings, almost the best hand at poker. Then
he began with assumed hesitation to bet on his
hand ; he kept raising the stake little by little
until the priest exclaimed : “Sure yez are trying
to bluff, so ye are ! ” and immediately started
raising it on his part. The others had dropped
out of the game and watched with painful in-
terest the stake grow and grow. The Mulligan
fraternity felt a cheerful certainty that the “old
man ” had made everything secure, and they
looked upon themselves as mercifully delivered
from a very unpleasant situation. The priest
went on doggedly raising the stake in response to
his antagonist’s challenges until it had attained
huge dimensions. Then he said: “Sure that’s
high enough,” and he put into the pool sufficient to
entitle him to see his opponent’s hand. The “ old
man ” with great gravity laid down his four kings;
the Mulligan boys let a big sigh of relief escape
them ; they were saved—he surely couldn’t beat
four kings. Then the priest laid down four aces
and scooped the pool.
# * #
The sportsmen of Mulligan’s never quite
knew how they got out to Rand wick to the races.
They borrowed a bit of money in Sydney and
found themselves in the saddling-paddock in a
half-dazed condition trying to realise what had
happened to them. During the afternoon they
were up at the end of the lawn near the Leger
stand, and from that enclosure they could hear the
babel of tongues, the small bookmakers, pea-and-
thimble men, confidence men, &c., plying their
trades. In the tumult of voices they heard one
which seemed familiar. After a while suspicion
became certainty, and they knew that it was the
voice of Father Ryan, who had cleaned them out.
They walked to the fence and looked over. They
could hear his voice distinctly, and this is what
he was saying : “Pop it down, gents! Pop it
down ! If you don’t put down a brick you can’t
pick up a castle ! I’ll bet no one here can find
the knave of hearts out of these three cards. I’ll
bet half-a-sovereign no one here can find the
knave!” Then the crowd parted a little, and
through the opening they could see him distinctly
—a three-card man—doing a great business and
showing wonderful dexterity with the pasteboard.
* • *
This was the downfall of Mulligan’s.
There is still enough money in Sydney to make it
worth while for another detachment of knowing
sportsmen to come down from that city ; but the
next lot will hesitate about playing cards with
strangers in the train.

Tales of Old Sydney.
No. I. The pure Merinoes' Ball.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The circles of the First Families were
being fanned by a gentle zephyr of excitement.
Those of the Ancients were being hurled hither
and thither by a gale of feeling that vied in
violence with a southerly-buster and in warmth
with a brickfielder. And yet, both the soft
breath of the zephyr and the far-ruder blast
issued from the portal of the Cave of the Winds
at one and the same moment had their
origin in the same cause. Which was nothing
less than the announcement that Colonel and
Mrs. Chester, of Chesterdale, proposed to cele-
brate their son’s arrival from “home,” with his'
“.home ’’-born bride, by a masquerade.
The bare intimation of the event would have
been itself sufficient to stimulate interest and
envy—to confer delight upon the one class and
to impose disgust upon the other, inasmuch as
Mrs. Colonel Chester’s balls were celebrated for
their magnificence and their exclusiveness.
When, however, we state that the cards of
invitation (specially engraved for the occasion by
the noted bank-note forger, Copper-plate Josephs)
distinctly and explicitly notified in the bottom left-
hand corner, and in Joseph’s most finished cali-
graphy, with a “ JVota Bene” to draw 7 particular
attention to the line, that “Mrs. Colonel Chester
declines to receive any member of the 'Emancipist
Families” it will be at once understood that the
effect of the announcement was most pronounced.
For the Emancipist Families, otherwise the?
“ Ancients,” had long since manifested symptoms
of the social and monetary greatness which was to
be theirs in the near Future; they had always
furnished the brains of the community; in later,
years they had come to supply much of the fashion
and the wealth as well; and, their founders had
never writhed more keenly under the lash than,
did the existing Ancients under the sting of Mrs.
Chester’s contempt. And, as for the Pure'
Merinoes who made up the First Families, the
repose that marked their caste as characteristically
as it impressed that of the Vere do Veres,
momentarily abandoned them in the prospect of
“getting,” for one night at least, “even” with
their enemies. The Pure Merinoes had never
forgotten or forgiven the Thompson, Bedfern
episodes and the Eagar, and though Governor)
Macquarie had left the colony some years, the
toast of “Damnation to Macquarie” was still
drunk at every Pure Merino festival of a
private character. Very proud of their
manners were the Merinoes, of the air of
hauteur and distinction which spoke of descent
from the heroes of the Bum-Puncheon Bevolution,
and yet they were all moved from their dignity as
it dawned upon their aristocratic and therefore
not tod’ intelligent perceptions that the Colonel's
lady had returned the slap in the face which the
First Families had received when Governor Mac-
quarie removed the bars to the Emancipists’ social
elevation and civil enfranchisement.
Once before Mrs. Colonel Chester had publicly
insulted the Ancients. It was in church (St.
James’) and at morning prayer. The Litany was
being read ; the minister had come to the petition
where pity is implored upon all prisoners and cap-
tives, and, as his wont was, he paused for a brief
space to let the intercession, if it might be, touch
the hearts of the convicts who thronged the
gallery. _
“ I think, dear,” the Colonel’s lady whispered
to the Colonel, so loud that the expression of her
charitable thought was audible to the whole eon-'
gregation in the nave; “I think, dear, don’t you,
it should be ‘ prisoners, captives and Eman-
cipists.’ ?”
But the sensation she had then created was
nothing to that occasioned by her card.
* # #
The Exclusives lost no time in conveying
to their esteemed would-be hostess their accept-
ances of her invitation and their appreciation of
her courage. It took some courage, let us say, to
bell the Emancipist eat, so masterful were the
Ancients becoming in monetary matters. The
Chesters, the Macarthurs, the Blaxlands, the
Busbys and their kin were prodigiously important.
But not all of their number w 7 ere wealthy. The
proverbial fate of all aristocracies and plutocracies
Was becoming the fate of their majority. The
second generation of the Pure Merinoes was, for
the most part, a spendthrift one, while Eman-
cipists’ families, on the contrary, were adding
acre to acre and coin to coin.
The Emancipists were already the usurers of
the community; they were fast becoming its
mortgagees and its bankers.. John Tawell, the'
pious, Quaker, by whose efforts the' Friends’
Meeting-house in MacquariC-street was erected,
and who was subsequently hanged in England for
the murder of his paramour, held, at one time,
over 300 mortgages, a list of which, it was said,
would have constituted an index to the great
official and land-holding cliques. Samuel T——
was the negotiator, at heavy discount, of all
kinds of “ paper,” and a dealer in securities of the
questionable sort; and the ex-transport who
figures in our narrative as Peter Stephens was the
“ bailee upon advance ” of every class of colonial
produce. These were not men to be affronted
with impunity, and perhaps with the,exception of
the Camden magnates —the Macleays and the
Chesters—no one would have dared t > openly cast
so outrageous an insult against so mighty a section-'
of the city people.
“ It’s quite certain Old Man Chester don’t owe'
the Ancients anything ! ” said Bob Warphy, with
a chuckle to Dick Temple as they were writing
their acceptances on adjacent desks in the Phillip-!
street Treasury.
“ Quite ! ” assented Temple. “But, oh, how’ll
they bleed the young ’un when he conies to them
to raise the wind ! The Ancients neyfer forget. ”
“ Bather, and not being ’ficial, he’ll have to pay
up, or be foreclosed upon. There are worse things,
Dick, than being on the Establishment at £l6
10s. id. per mensem, ain’t there ? ”
“ ’So, Bob, as long as you can wipe off a year’s-
interest op a loan by tinkering a contract or
registering a land-grant which His Excellency
never saw! ”
And the pair of official beauties laughed as
though it was the richest thing in the world for
Government officials to liquidate their private
liabilities by the manipulation of Government
accounts and the forgery—it was nothing else—
of title-deeds.
As perhaps it was.
* * *
The readiness with which the Exclusives
acknowledged Mrs. Colonel Chester’s card met its
parallel in the Emancipist eagerness to return the
insult. Copper-plate Josephs had printed a few
extra cards, and with much pretence of secresy
had dropped one here and there into an Emanci-
pist’s hand.
Not that the Ancients were, altogether, depen-
dant on Copper-plate Josephs’courtesy for their
knowledge of Mrs. Chester’s festivity. They had
other sources of information.
When the Colon'al Secretary’s orderly, whose
services for the delivery of her cards had been
requisitioned by the Colonel’s lady, had left her
papa’s and mamma’s and her own invitation at
their villa at Elizabeth Bay, Miss Harrington,
daughter of Harrington of the Surveys, was so
grieved and shocked by Mrs. Chester’s bad taste,
that she at once went to condole with her bosom-
friend, Miss Kent, daughter of old Kent (original
term, seven years), who had risen to wealth
rapidly on rum.
Now, Mrs. Kent and Miss Kent were particu-
larly toney. But for that youthful aberration of
the old man’s, their pretensions to being quite
tip toppy would have been admitted by the first
of the First Families. Mrs. Kent was a widow
of a N.S.W. Corps officer, who had married the
rich Emancipist for his money, and thus her
antecedents entitled her and her’s to social recog-
nition on all ordinary occasions. Mrs. Chester’s
fiat had, however, secluded her as effectively from
the Chesterdale fete, as were Adam and Eve from
Paradise. Therefore was she to be sympathised
with, thought Miss Harrington. And this is how
she sympathised.
* & *
Mrs. Kent and ne?.daughter were lolling,
in the former’s boudoir Shaded from the March
sunshine, when Miss Harrmgton was announced.
‘‘So kind of you, dearest Nell,” languidly
whispered the matron, “to run over and see us.
Really the summer’s lasting so long that I feel
quite unequal to anything these days till after-*
noon. My call-list is terribly behind.”
, “Poor, dear Mrs, Kent, this weather is trying.
But, of course, before the Chesterdale ball, you
know ’twill be quite cool.”
“ The Chesterdale ball ! When’s that ? I haven’t
heard.” It was the 18-year-old Kent-girl who
broke in thus abruptly.
,“Oh, Alice dear, haven’t you got your card yet?
We received ours an hour ago, and thought I’d
just rim over and discuss together what we’d
wear.”
“ No, we’ve not a card yet, P’r’aps it’ll have
gone to Pa at the office,” sard the girl, chagrined.
, Mrs. Kent was roused from her languor. “ Our
cards, you know, Alice, never go to your father,
When is it to, be, Nell ?”
“ The 16th May, dear Mrs. Kent. I made sure
you’d have had yours with mine. Our houses are
so close, and the orderly would leave them almost
at the same time. The stupid fellow must have
forgotten yours.”
“That must have been it, raa!” cried Miss
Kent. “ We’ll have ours in the afternoon.”
Miss Harrington, a moment later, fumbling in
her pocket for her handkerchief, pulled out a card
which dropped on the floor. A clumsy
Miss Harrington.
“Well, I declare!” she exclaimed. “I must
have picked up Miss Chester's oard-with my hand-
kerchief as 1 was coining across to you. How
funny !” She was replacing the card in her dres&-
fold when Miss Kent begged for a glance at it.
“Oh, certainly, dear Alice!” And with the
most innocent of demeanours the bombshell was
handed oyer-to the daughter of the house.
Hive minutes later Miss Harrington was ordered
out of the house by an indignant mother and
smacked on the face by a betrayed bosom friend.
“This is your mean spite, Miss Harrington;
your contemptible spite! You knew all along
what was on this card. You’re as bad as Mrs.
Chester.” It was the Kent nitre who thus vented
her passion.
“To think it’s your hand, Nell; the hand of a
pretended friend, who has pretended to sympathise
so with me over poor pa’s early misfortune—oh,
you—boo, boo !”—This from the wounded heart of
the daughter.
And notwithstanding Nell Harrington’s assev-
erations that she had not noticed Mrs, Colonel
Chester’s “N.B.”—if a clumsy actress, Nell Har-
rington was still a pretty "fibber—Mrs. Kent’s
stalwart footman (a burglar with violence)
escorted her to the door. The pain of her
wounded feelings and sore face was, however,
greatly alleviated by the hearty laughter with
which the story of her visit of condolence, as she
reported it, was welcomed in Pure Merino circles.
The laughter would not have been so hearty could
the upshot of Miss IN ell’s sympathetic excursion
have been foreseen.
* # *
Mrs. Kent, as we have said, was “toney.”
It was not toney to be anything but languid in
hot weather, and yet Miss Harrington had not
regained her father’s house before Mrs. Kent had
been aroused to a fever of energy.
“ Don’t cry, Ally,” she besought her daughter ;
“go and. dress.. We’ll go into town and see your
father. We’ll have bur revenge or my name’s not
Jennie Kent.”
And driving in her stylish damage on the way
to Pitt-street, where the great merchant firm of
Stephens and Kent conducted their business in a
dingy, tumble-down rookery, the good lady
planned a scheme which. proved her ancestry.
You coidd always depend upon a descendant of
the Old Corps for shining in, any scandalous
transaction. Blood unmistakably told in such
cases. •
“There’s Robert Warphy and young Temple,
Ally. Bow, child,” and she checked the carriage.
“ Good day, Mr. Warphy ! How d’ye do, Mr.
Temple ? Got your cards yet for Mrs. Chester’s
great night ?”
The men, wondering how ,on earth she had
learnt the news so early, answered, in a breath,
that they had.
“Ah, Mrs. Chester will have a distinguished
gathering. And have, you decided on your char-
acters yet, may I ask •
“ Not had time, Mrs. Kent. Only got card
this morning,” answered Warphy.
“ Oh, perhaps you’ll take a suggestion from me
then,” sweetly said the eider lady. “Let me
suggest a disguise, will you, Mr. Warphy ?”
“ Certainly, madam ; too happy, I’m sure.”
“ Me, too, Mrs. Kent, if you don’t mind, you’ve
a nice fancy, I know. Only let it be something
out of the common.” - .

“Thengo both'of you as gentlemen, sirs-the
disguise will be perfect, and as the ’Mancipists
are excluded, the character will be rare enough in
the company. Drive on, coachman.”
“Bob!”
“ Temple ! ”
“ If the easv-going Kent woman’s cutting up in
this way, there’ll be war, Bob ! ”
“ To the knife Dick ! ”
’ ‘ #
That was the first shot from the Jtman-
cipist forces in reply to Mrs, Chester’s shell. It
was not the last by many : the Ancients never
forgot. In the dadoed drawing-room of a Potts
Point mansion one day in 1885, Mrs. Kent’s
granddaughter had something to say about tins
very matter to Mrs. Chester’s granddaughter,
That, however, is a tale for another time.
Mrs. Kent was shown into her husband’s
private offiee. Her daughter followed.
P “ Paul ’’-Kent was Paul, Stephens was Peter,
and the firm was as often referred to as Peter and
Paul as Stephens and Kent- 11 Paul, read this !”
She held out to him Mrs. Chester’s card to the
Harringtons. In the excitement of her expulsion
Miss Harrington had forgotten to reclaim it.
“ Mrs. Chester’s ?” said the old man, a withered,
** by
p “ Whose’^ , n ’
“An rnmrr-r showed it to me ”
Then the°mother told him of the Harrington
episode, and the daughter punctuated the elder
woman’s speech with a succession of sobs.
“ You want to be revenged, Jennie, and you,
Polly, dear?” And the old man’s eyes lit up, with
the fires of the love of his daughter, and of the
hatred of the Official Families which kept him
alive; “so you shall !-John !”
His confidential clerk appeared, received a
whispered instruction, and left the office.
“ Can you suggest anything, Jennie? I have
my own ideas, but I’ll be glad to hear of any plan
vmi nnv have formed ”
She‘had a plan and she told it to him, first
sending away their young daughter. “ Take the
carriage, Ally, and drive upland down George-
dear ' t 0 the
■ She had fully unfolded her plan, when thederk
T says, sir, he has two overdue-
acceptances of Harrington’s, £l5O apiece. Inter-
est, accumulated to last ‘ rest’ day, £27 9s. 6d.;
total, £327 9s. fid. He’ll let you have ’em for
that, as he doesn’t want Harrington any more, for
he’s just made other arrangements for the meat-
contracts.”
(Now the other arrangements were with Bob
Warphy, who offered to do all the account-tinker-
ing necessary to swindle the Government for the
benefit of the great ’Mancipist contractor at l-16th
of a penny per pound of meat. Harrington had
been gluttonous; he wanted an eighth.)
“Take him,” said Paul. “ And Mr. Tawell?”
“ Sends this, sir.” With the customary cautious-
ness of the broad-brims, Tawell had sent a sealed
note in response to Mr. Kent’s request, as follows:
29th March.
The undersigned hast a mortgage of one Harold Har-
rington, over Section 7 B, Parish Wulumooloo, dwelling-
house and sundry appurtenances thereon, which thee,
Paul Kent, is at liberty to foreclose, due consideration
being made therefor to the undersigned, and thee under-
taking that thee hast no ungodly design in thus taking
upon thvself the just liability of the aforesaid H.H.
Signed Joint Tawkll.
“Thee art a rare humbug, John Tawell,”
mocked the merchant, as he read the note to his
wife, but thy canting piety shaft not save thee
from being hanged by the neck till thou art dead
some day. Ungodly motive, indeed ! The old
wretch would not forego the profit upon fore-
closure himself, if he did not guess I meant what
he calls ‘ deviltry and ungodliness. ’ ” He paused
to make a calculation or two, and then resumed —
“ Now, Jane, I’ve got the Harrington on the hip.
Do you go and get the woman and dress her out.
Let me have her name and ship’s number as soon
as you've picked her out, so that I can get her
assigned. It shall all be arranged by to-night.”
# # *
At the ’Mancipists' Club—they call it
another name now a-days—luncheon that day was
characterised by more than usual oyer-feeding and
over-drinking, and particularly excited talk. Some
eight or nine of the members, the most distin-
guished among the Ancients of the colony, had
received similar deputations of their wives and
daughters to that which had broken in upon Paul
Kent’s morning.
“ I’d like to slaughter the jade, ’er ! ”
shouted Fleece, the wool-man (“life” but con-
ditionally pardoned), who had rather a reputation
for nicety of speech. “ ’er,’er own ’usband
ought to be shot for ’is part in the Bligh bis’ness.”
The remark was enthusiastically applauded, and
the applause gave Mr. Paul Kent an idea.
“ I’ve a notion to disgrace the whole affair, and
burst it up with a scene, but it’ll take money,” he
wheezed.
“Damn the money! ’Ow much?” Fleece
roared.
“ Five hundred ; I’ll stand a fifth of it! ” Paul
answered.
“ G’arantee a good smash for the cash ? ”
“No smash, no pay. I won't ask for the
money if the whole thing doesn’t end with the
biggest scandal the colony ever knew ! ”
“Good! It’ll be a big thing then ! ” quoth
Quipley, the ’Mancipist Attorney, who had all the
best of the business of the expatriated. “On
those terms I’m down for fifty, Mr. Kent.”
Faster than Paul could pencil the amounts on
the back of Mrs. Harrington’s invite-card were,
subscriptions announced. In one minute he had
down £575, excluding his own hundred pounds.
“ Six-seventy subscribed,” said Quipley. “More
than you said,”Mr. Kent. We’ll divide expenses
pro rata,”
“ No,” said Mr. Kent, “my hundred goes in
whole. That’s for my little girl. The balance
can go proportionately among the rest. But I
told the missus I’d spend a hundred to insult my
Lady Chester, and I will.
# * *
The manner in which Pam Kent, Esquire,
J.P., disbursed that £675 subscribed to the Smash-
up Fund, or, rather, the major portion of it, was
peculiarly suggestive of life in Old Sydney during
the decade from 1825 to 1835. Let us explain by
reporting certain conversations.
Mr. Kent requested an interview with Mr.
E. E. Scragge, Barrack Master.
“ There’s those Lord Warden women, Mr.
Scragge. My wife inspected some of them yester-
day, and she would like Ruth Fenwick, No. 119
on ship’s list, governess, 10 years.”
“Very sorry, Mr. Kent, ’m sure, but that
transport is bespoke. Mr. Macarthur has had a
standing requisition for a really accomplished girl
for the last six months, and I’ve already promised
her to him.”
“ Ah, that’s a pity—my wife was so taken with
the girl.” •
“Yes, she’s a real dashing piece, educated to
the nines, talks Shakespeare and the musical-
glasses, you know ;no sham ’bout her. Might
readily mistake her for a real lady, and so forth.”
“So Mrs. Kent said. Well, as the girl’s gone
it can’t be helped, so good day.” And the old
schemer turned to depart.
“ Good day, Mr. Kent, really sorry can’t oblige
you this time. No other girl suit, I s’pose? ”
“ No, thank you. Oh, and by the way, Mr.
Soragge, there’s a little matter my partner
Stephens asked me to mention to you—an overdue,
considerably overdue, bill.”
“ H’m, ah ! But Mr. Stephens said he wouldn’t
press for that yet a while.”
“ That was four months ago, and it had been re-
newed thrice up to then. No, Peter says he
must exact payment now. When shall I say it
will be convenient, Mr. Scragge? ”
“ It won’t be convenient this three months ”
“ Cards been against you, Mr, Scragge, of late?”
“ Sir! Do you mean ”
“Nothing, of course. But Peter wants his
money.”
“He can’t have it. Come, Mr. Kent, don’t be
unreasonable ! What can I do for you ? On
what terms will you renew ?”
“ You’re not in the Treasury, Mr. Scragge, and
therefore you can’t give or alter a contract in our
favour, and you’re not at the Lands or Survey,
and therefore you can’t give us a hundred acres
or so to balance a trifle of interest ”
“No, Pm not,” exclaimed the Barrack-Master,
“but I’ve charge of assignments. You’ve got
eighty assigned men nbw, Mr. Kent, more’n your
number, but I don’t mind letting you have
another five or ten to renew the bill for twelve
months.”
Mr. Kent meditated—ostensibly; really, he was
enjoying the joke.
“No, one’ll do—this girl Fenwick !”
Quick as the flash of thought came the official
reply. “Oh, damn her; done!”
“ And Captain Mac. ?” queried the ’Mancipist,
with a malicious drawing down of his left eyelid,
“ He—he doesn’t know the girl’s name, and
hasn’t seen her.” And Scragge laughed con-
fusedly.
The first charge on the Emancipists’ subscrip-
tions was to liquidate a matter of £2O or so in
Stephens and Kent’s books —“ Interest debited to
E. E. Scragge’s loan-account.”
* * #
The second charge was £327 9s. 6d.,
amount paid to release Mr. Harold Harrington’s
past-due bills from Sam T ’s hands.
The third charge was £lOO, for a ball-dress for a
certain lady. “Do the thing in first-class style,
Jennie,” were Mr. Kent’s fond words, and the
skill of Madame De Yoleure, the fashionable cos-
tumiere, of George-street (who was connected with
the highest circles at home, having been at the
time of her trial and conviction personal attendant
to a Countess), was consequently taxed to do jus-
tice to the tall, willowy beauty who was intro-
duced to her by Mrs. Kent. Very busy was
Madame that April month, for artistic genius of
the highest kind was not plentiful in Sydney, and
the demand for fancy dress was enormous.
The fourth charge was £lO, paid to Madame to
keep her mouth shut. She faithfully earned it.
And as to the fifth charge—well, we’ll allow
Harold Harrington, Esquire, of the Treasury, to
speak.
“ it, Mr. Kent, you can’t mean that
besides holding these dishonoured bills ”
“Not dishonored, Mr. Harrington?” said old
Kent, in a sarcastic wheeze, “simply overdue.
No Government official of the present day ever
fails to meet his acceptances.”
“ You’ll have your jest, Mr. Kent, but d’ye
mean to say, besides these bills, you arc the
transferror of my mortgage to Broad-brim
Tawell ? ”
“ I hold the mortgage on your property.”
“ And intend to sell me up ? , This is the result
of the freak of that wretched girl of mine.”
“Not to mince words, that is my intention, and
it is distinctly due to your daughter’s freak, as
you call it.”
“ You intend to ruin me because of a girl’s
nonsense. God ! ”
“ That is my intention, unless ”
“ Oh, I’ll do anything in reason. There’s those
new meal and flour contracts, Kent, to be let in
June. I’ll get ’em for your firm, and my com-
mission will about square the bills, and you can
let the mortgage stand.”
“What’ll T say? And the Australian
Agricultural people ? They usually divide the big
meat business.”
“ Oh, damn T , and I’ll fix up the A. A.
people! ”
“Strangely enough, that’s what T says of
you. He says ‘ Damn Harrington ! ”
“ Does he ! After all I’ve done for him I”
“Yes, rather ungrateful now to throw you over.
But you see, Mr. Harrington, your terms are too
high for him—that’s the reason he let me have
your bills. Paid him full value for them with
interest.”
“ Too high ! I only charge him an-eighth of a
penny when I give him credit for an extra half-
penny on the meat, and ten shillings a ton on flour
while I over-credit him a pound. Too high ! But
I’ll do it even less for you, Mr. Kent, if you’ll
agree to my suggestion.”
“ No, but I’ll tell you what I’ll do. Take a lady
to the Ohesterdale ball for me instead of your
daughter, and I’ll tear up the bills as soon as she
sets foot in your carriage that night, and the day
after I’ll renew the mortgage at 10 per cent, for
seven years. Refuse, and I’ll screw you up at
once!”
“ But my daughter ! what shall I say to her and
Mrs. H.?”
“What you like!” laconically rejoined the
’Manoipist.
“ But we’re to unmask at supper! There 11 be
the devil to pay when the Chesters and others
recognise your daughter!”
“ I’ll be at Ohesterdale gate with my carriage at
12.30—you’ll not go in to supper before then—and
you can bring—the girl—through the shrubberies
tome, if you like,” said the merchant. He added,
under his breath, “ And if you can.”
For some moments Harold Harrington, Esquire,
of the Treasury, and most distinguished Pure
Merino, considered the situation. On the one
side there was shameful Ruin, and on the other,
domestic discord, and, in the event of discovery,
offence to a powerful lady, and to the First
Families generally. Then he made his decision
by saying : “ I’ll take your daughter.”
Mr. Kent smiled as he reflected that Mr. _ Har-
rington was jumping to conclusions. He himself
had never alluded to his daughter.
“ One other point is, that you must not inform
your daughter you cannot take her till the very
night of the dance !”

Ihe fifth (and final) charge against the Eman-
cipist subscriptions was entered by Mr. Kent as
a surn of fifteen guineas for the legal expenses in-
curred in transferring Harrington’s mortgage to
himself from Quaker Tawell. He thought it was
a fair outlay from the fund, and when his fellow-
subscribers audited the accounts a month later
they agreed with him. Under the circumstances,
they said, he could not have asked Harrington to
pay Quipley’s bill of costs. And we will antici-
pate a little byremarking that the Emancipist
subscribers were well pleased at the use to which
Mr. Kent had applied the Smash-up Fund. With
the balance they purchased sets of brilliants for
Mrs. and Miss Kent. You will thereby infer
that the Pure Mennoes’ Ball was smashed-up.
And you will be correct.

wife’s and his daughter’s reproaches, and how he
bade them hold their tongues on peril of ruin;
how his wife wouldn’t go to the ball because their
daughter had to stop home; how he called at the

grown since he last had seen her; how Mrs.
Colonel Chester complimented him as she wel-

how Marie Antoinette danced in a quadrille with

charmingly that even when the Lieutenant

Antoinette, having had too much champagne,
refused to unmask till she had danced the

Antoinette merged into Ruth Fenwick, transport

PRICE WARUNG.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Land of the Earth’s first morning, in the farthest
Orient set,
Whore the night of ancient chaos and the earliest
dawning met,
Whoso cliffs were built by the giants in the ages
of long ago—
Their hands were the rushing waters and the
ocean’s restless flow,
And their spade was the old Ice River, and their
plane the desert blast,
And their hammer was the cataract in that dark,
forgotten past;
Land of unfathomed darkness whose beginning
none may know.
Whose cities of old mayhap are sunk in the
sombre caves below,
Whose fathers, perchance, were heroes when the
sun that gilt their spears
Had not yet grown old with the weary load of an
endless waste of years
Awake from thy long, long slumber by the shores
of thy sunlit sea,
Awake, for the voice of the Future has spoken a
message to thee 1
And it tells of a glory that dawneth where thy
new-born sons have trod
In this land whose Past is buried in the dust of
the gates of God ;
And ot flowers that shall deck thy pathway, like
gems from the ocean floor,
And a joy that shall gladden thy starry eyes,
where trouble shall be no more.
Bright as thy skies thy plains shall be, and the
planets that shine on thee
Shall be fairer far that the fairest star of the sun-
less northern sea,
And thy walls shall be strong the coasts along,
like the rocks of the sea-bed’s roof,
Where the sea-queens weave thy robes of foam
with the spray for their warp and woof;
And the oceans wide on either side shall be thy
mail of proof.
Thy crown of might shall be fashioned forth from
shreds of the burning sun,
As it flames on high with its gleaming eye and its
veil of the cloud-wrack spun ;
And the glittering walls of thy palace halls shall
■ be dug from the caverns old,
Erom the caves of night where the rays of light
were buried and turned to gold ;
Thy jewels shall the star-dust be, and the straits
thy emerald zone,
And the fretted shapes of the rocky capes shall
build the lofty throne
Where the Last of all the Nations shall sit in her
strength—alone.
Therefore wake, 0 isle of gems and gold, from thy
slumbers by the sea,
Fora Voice, like the voice of the rushing winds
that sweep through eternity,
Comes forth from the gloom of the centuries to
tell this message to thee.

SKETCHES FROM A LIFE OF ACTION.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
IV.
In 1861 Sir George Grey was suddenly
summoned from the Capo to assume again the
Governorship of New Zealand, vice Colonel Gore
Browne recalled. He left behind him a very great
reputation, and is still held in memory as the
most popular of all South African Governors.
The news of his appointment in New Zealand
caused universal rejoicing, and to none more than
th o Ministry, under the Premiership of Sir
William Pox, although it contained some of the
most bitter of Grey’s former opponents.
Ihe hasty action of Colonel Gore Browne,
spurred on by the greed of land-grabbers for
native lands, had plunged the country into a war
which was rapidly assuming alarming proportions.
]• _ ea^an d had entered the struggle with a
light heart, on what subsequently turned out to
be utterly unjustifiable assumptions, thinking
that it would be easy to put down the supposed
tribal insurrection with a handful of troops in a
few weeks. But within a few days of the com-
mencement of hostilities it became evident that at
least 5000 men would be required if the colony
was to hold its own, and soon Colonel Browne
ec^are that he would require at least
A),000 men to protect individual settlers. This
meant the abandonment of all holdings in the
country districts, and the huddling together of
families in towns and protected places, which
would involve the ruin of the country districts.
Unce more were all hopes concentrated on Sir
George Grey as the one person assuredly capable of
grappling with the situation. Though possibly he
might not be able immediately to stop hostilities,
yet it was felt that he would not rush into action
until fully prepared, and that his influence, ex-
perience and personal knowledge of the Maoris,
afforded reasons for believing that he might pre-
vail in soothing native animosity and Conciliating
native prejudice where others would fail.
Sir G-eorge Grey landed in Auckland on 20th
September, 1861, and found the hostile forces on
his arrival resting in armed expectation on a
shallow truce. Showing a firm front and pushing
forward his preparations, his efforts were directed
to gain the confidence of the Maoris, and give
them clearly to understand that military opera-
tions w6u.ld only be resumed as a last resort.
The Imperial Government placed 6000 troops at
bir George s disposal. To keep these idle would
lead to their recall, so the Governor employed
thorn ™ making a road towards the Waikato,
ihe Maoris certainly looked uoon this with
suspicion, and threatened to treat it as a casus
hdii if the road were pushed beyond the
Maungatawhm River. But the Maori counsels
were divided, and there is little doubt that if Sir
George had been left to deal with the matter in
'V? ° wn w ay, the war feeling would have sub-
sided, and the natives have been gradually
pacified without fighting. But the' Colonial
Gfhce was dissatisfied with this state of affairs
and tlie War Office soon lifted up its voice.
The Duke of Newcastle (Secretary of State for
the Colonies) insisted that there was no reason
for retaining the troops, and the War Office sent
peremptory orders to the Commissary-General to
make no further advances from the military chest
on any pretext whatever. The Duke complained
of the ‘ apathy of the colonists 55 and called upon
the Governor for an immediate report. Sir George
accepted this as a personal reproof and asked for
copies of the reports to the War Office on which
the Duke’s letter was based, declared that his
policy of road-making was certainly wiser than
fighting, and was confident that the Home
Government would yet see reason to approve of
his action.
General Cameron was the person whose reports
had thus stirred up the War Office, and this was
the commencement of the bitter feud that after-
wards raged between the General and the Gover-
nor. But for a time matters were patched up,
and the Duke of Newcastle, in reply to Sir George'
stated that his despatch was not intended to
reflect upon his conduct, but as a warning to his
Ministers, and hoped it would tend to strengthen
his (the Governor’s) hand in dealing with them.
Road-making was steadily proceeded with, and
meanwhile. Sir George entered on a thorough
investigation of the Waitara land-purchase, the
original cause of the war. Enquiry left no doubt
that the purchase was absolutely illegal from every
point of view. Teira, who had sold the land, had
only a right of occupation, the mana (tribal title)
to the land resting in Wiremu Kingi, the protest-
ing chief, and, moreover, it was afterwards proved
that Teira had sold the land with the deliberate
design of forcing Kingi’s tribe into war with the
settlers in revenge for an alleged insult. The
Governor, therefore, decided that the money paid
to Teira should be abandoned, and the purchase
rescinded. Had this at once been acted on, peace
would have followed, and the Maoris, with this
proof of just dealing before them, would pro-
bably have become not only conciliated, but firmlv
attached to British rule.
But it was not to be; while the Governor
thought the difficulty settled, the Ministry
(Domett’s) were dilly-dallying over the earnest
recommendations of Sir George, fearing that it
might be looked upon as a sign of weakness if
they acknowledged that an act of injustice had
been perpetrated, and took the only step in their
power to remedy it. At length they agreed to the
measure, but it was too late—by four days.
The Maoris had occupied Tataramiaka, a block
of land which they acknowledged to have been
fairly purchased, as utu (revenge) for the purchase
of Waitara. It was reported to the Governor that
on Waitara being given up, Tataramiaka might
be at once reoccupied by the troops, and accord-
ingly when he had resolved on abandoning the
Waitara purchase, Grey sent a Ijody df men to re-
occupy Tatarairnaka. On the Bth May the
Ministers signed a formal renunciation of the
Waitara, but on the 4th May the Maoris seeing l
no signs of the expected cession, and thinking
they were being tricked, and that the reoccupa-
tion of Tatarairnaka was a new declaration of
war, had already recommenced hostilities (Maori
fashion) by shooting down Dr. Hope, Lieutenant
Tragett, two sergeants and three privates of the
57th Regiment as they were proceeding from
Tatarairnaka to the town by way of the coast.
Grey was utterly prostrated by the blow. All
his carefully-devised schemes by which ho had, as
he thought, restored peace to New Zealand, were
at once shattered by the dastardly moral cowardice
of the Ministry, and war was now inevitable.
The events of the war are matter of history.
*
The Ministry now determined on a spirited
war policy, and the Assembly certainly backed up
the Ministry. It went, in fact, beyond them, and
Domett not being spirited enough for the vindic-
tive spirit of the Assembly, was defeated and
succeeded by the Eox-Whilaker Administration. -
Measures were at once framed giving the Govern-
ment the most despotic powers, and abolishing
every safeguard of liberty and human right that
had hitherto been enjoyed by the Maoris in com-
mon with other inhabitants of New Zealand.
Native land, also, was to be subject to confiscation
on a gigantic scale.
Sir George Grey exerted all his legitimate in-
fluence m mitigation of these enormities of panic
legislation. As a constitutional Governor he
could not actually interfere with the course of
legislation, and he was chary of using his power
of veto except when absolutely necessary. He
regarded the war as unjust in its origin, and
maintained that the lessons of the past showed
that generosity in dealing with the enemy had
always been more successful than severity.
On one point he was firm. The Ministry
wished to confiscate some 6,000,000 acres, but the
Governor absolutely refused to sanction any
measure for the confiscation of any area exceed-
ing a maximum of 2,792,000 acres, and this only
on condition that the rights of all owners of
lands, not actually proved to have been in arms,
were guaranteed. The other obnoxious measures
were, on his expostulation, toned down, and their
operation limited to the end of the
session.
The relations between the Governor and Ins
responsible advisers were now greatly strained,
and the tension increased after the gallant
fight of Rangiriri, in which 600 Maoris
stood manfully _ for over 12 hours against
some 1200 British troops, assisted by artil-
lery and gunboats, and retired after killing
and wounding 132 men, leaving behind 100 dead
and 185 prisoners. To their honour be it said, the
soldiery, moved by the gallantry of the Maoris,
rushed into the pah after its capture, and shook
hands warmly with the conquered foe, cheering
and praising them for the stand they had made.
General Cameron, too, wrote pleading for gener-
ous treatment of the prisoners, “for everyone,”
he wrote, “must admire the brave manner in
which they defended their position to the last.”
Needless _ to say that Sir George Grey was
urgent in his pleas for liberal treatment of these
prisoners of war. But the shortsighted vindic-
tiveness of the Ministry made them deaf to such
pleas._ They insisted on the prisoners being dealt
with in the spirit of the Rebellion Act, and they
were all confined on hulks and very harshly
treated. This ungenerous conduct of the Govern-
ment brought about its own punishment. The
famous Wiremu Tamihana (William Thompson),
struck by the generous conduct of the soldiery at
Rangiriri, was trying to bring about a pacification
of the Maoris, and would have succeeded. But
the confinement of the prisoners, alarming rumours
of their intended punishment, and further
rumours of extensive confiscation caused the
failure of Tamihana’s efforts.
* * #
Reference has been made to the adverse
reports sent by General Cameron to the War
Office and the manner in which this interference
was resented by the Governor. Instructions were
then issued to the General to forward all his
reports through the Governor in future, and then
General Cameron adopted a course which was
even more undignified and unfair. He wrote
freely, and ostensibly in confidence, to Grey,
expressing himself very disparagingly about the
Ministry _ and the settlers generally. But Sir
George discovered that copies of all these so-called
confidential letters were sent by the General,
with his despatches, to the War Office.
Now, these letters drew such strong rebukes
from the Colonial Office, to which they were com-
municated by the. War Office, that Sir George
determined not to allow the Ministry and colony
to be maligned any longer without the oppor-
tunity of reply. Accordingly, on receiving
another letter from Cameron, in which the latter
charged the Ministry with caring nothing about
the lives of his soldiers so long a-S they could seize
Maori lands; and stating that he looked upon the
proposed occupation of the Wtiitotara Block as
“a more iniquitous job than that of the Waitara,”
Sir George determined upon action.
Accordingly, he laid the letter before the
Ministers, who took the matter up very warmly
indeed. The General now turned round and
accused Sir George of breach of confidence,
asserting that he had written in the freedom of
private correspondence. This plea the Governor
refused to admit, stating that there could be no
privacy, considering that copiesof these letters were
always forwarded to the War Office, and, that
being the case, it was clearly his duty not to allow
his Ministry to remain in ignorance of such
charges. The quarrel grew more and more bitter,
the War Office backing up the General, and the
Ministry, the Governor.
It should be stated that the Ministry now in
power was very different in every respect to the
vindictive, short-sighted, land-grabbing Whitaker-
Fox Ministry. In 1864, this had been defeated,
and had been succeeded by Mr. Weld at the head
of an administration in favour of pacific and
liberal measures. Peace was concluded, except
with the Hauliau fanatics. Native Land Courts
were established, and a Native Rights Act con-
firmed Maori tenure according to ancient customs
and usages. All questions of Maori title, so far
as they depended on Maori custom or law, were
thus finally removed from the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court. In fact, the legislation of the
Weld Ministry on Maori affairs was, throughout,
generous and statesmanlike, and it is hot astonish-
ing, under these circumstances, that the ground-
less charges, of General Cameron excited the
indignation of the Governor.
But what filled the cup of the General’s wrath
was the capture by Sir George Grey, with a small
mixed force of volunteers and friendly natives, of
the important Wereroa pah, some 20 miles from
Wangahui, in the hands of the Hauhaus a strong
rallying point arid a constant source of danger to
the settlements. The Governor had repeatedly
urged on Cameron the vital necessity of taking
the pah, and thus expelling the Hauhau fanatics
|rom the district. The General, however, persist-
ently refused, alleging the great strength of the
pah, both by reason of its natural position and the
Maori fortifications, and finally declared that he
would never attack it until he could command a
force of 15,000 men for the work.
The correspondence grew warmer and warmer,
until Grey laid the last of those letters, written at
the end of March, 1865, before his Ministry,
After this, there were further urgent reasons
why the pah should be taken. A small force was
closely besieged by a strong Hauhau band at
Pipiriki, up the Wanganui River, and no force
could be sent to its relief till Weraroa had fallen.
The controversy raged between the Governor and
the General till June, 1865, when Cameron
arrived in Auckland on his way to England via
Sydney. Sir George would hot brook further
delay; since the General Commanding-in-Ohief
refused to take the pah, he would take it himself,
and take it he did a fortnight before Cameron
left Auckland.
Hearing that the Hauhau garrison at Weraroa
had been reduced, Sir George hit Auckland, and
on the 17th July he arrived before the pah and
reconnoitred. He then collected his forces, and
on the 28th advanced to the attack with 164
volunteer cavalry and rangers, 109 of the native
contingent, and 100 armed friendly natives. A
portion of the force marched through the bush to
the rear of the fortifications, a redoubt on a hill
in this quarter was surprised and 50 prisoners
taken, and after dropping a few shots into the
pah, the Hauhaus vacated it, and it fell into the
attackers’ hands without the loss or even wound-
ing of a single man.
The irregular method of this victory, in the eyes
of Cameron and the War Office, constituted a
mortal oflence. The General wrote furious letters
to the Governor ; the Minister for War, Earl de
Grey, took up the cudgels on behalf of the
General, and held the conduct of the Governor,
in making known to his Ministers letters that
the General considered confidential, unpardon-
able. The Minister for the Colonies communi-
cated this letter to Sir George Grey, who in reply
used outspoken language.
He referred in very strong terms to the
General’s charges and characterised them as
“malicious and unfounded.” He further stated
that he considered that Cameron, in making such
charges, and Earl de Grey, in privately receiving
them, were the real wrong-doers, and not he (Sir
George), who had treated these charges as
publicly made, and had met them publicly from
the first.
But yet more was to come. The doughty
Governor had run a tilt at the War Office; he
next dared to cross swords with the Secretary of
State for the Colonies—his own official head !
t In April, 1866, Mr. Cardwell sent Sir George
Grey a despatch marked “Confidential,” in
reference to letters sent home by friends of
Cameron, and published in the London papers,
in which the war operations were denounced as
cruel and brutal, and in the despatch the Colonial
Minister urged Sir George “to secure the observ-
ance of all the humane usages of war.” It was
well known that letters of the kind referred to
were , constantly being published, but up to now
the Government had been given no opportunity
of vindicating itself. Sir George, therefore, now
made an opportunity in the opening afforded by
the Colonial Minister’s letter, although this was
marked “confidential.” He accordingly laid Mr.
Cardwell’s despatch before them. Vigorous was
their repudiation of the scandalous charges, and
furious the denunciation of Sir George Grey by
the Colonial Office.
He was again accused of treating as public
documents despatches which were intended to be
confidential, but he contended that it was most
improper to send him, marked as “confidential,”
letters which reflected severely on his Ministers
and the colony, and which were thus placed
officially on record without an opportunity for
refutation being recorded. To say the Colonial
Office was flustered by this vigorous remonstrance
would be far too mild an expression to use—but
let it stand. The Governor was urged to with-
draw his strongly-worded protest, the Colonial
Minister concluding his dispatch by saying that
he refrained from considering what would be the
proper course for Her Majesty’s Government to
take until he received the Governor’s reply.
Sir George Grey, however, maintained his
manly attitude and declined to withdraw his
remonstrance. He held, he stated, that his duty
to his Ministers and to the colony required that
the reply should remain on record with the charges
that had called it forth.
In June, 1867, the climax was reached, and the
Duke of Buckingham, then Minister for the
Colonies, wrote regretting the controversies that
had so long existed between the Governor and
the officer in command of the forces, and adding ;
“ I shall soon be able to inform you of the appoint-
ment of your successor, and of the time at which
he may be expected to arrive in the colony.”
It was for the people of New Zealand that Sir
George Grey had bearded the powers of Downing-
strcet, and the people of New Zealand appreciated
the noble stand lie had made. His recall raised
Sir George to the very pinnacle of popularity from
end to end of the country. Addresses from every
class of the community showered down upon him—
from Parliament, from the Ministry— even from
his erstwhile bitterest opponents. An address
was a'so sent to the Queen, requesting that some
mark of special favour should bo bestowed on one
who had rendered services of so exceptionally dis-
tinguished a character. Perhaps, fortunately, no
attention was paid to this address. True, his
services, as has been shown, had been of the
highest value to every country in which he had
exercised the functions of Vice-regent, and also to
the Mother Country, but he had proved troublesome
to Downing-street, and that was enough to ensure
his being politically ignored by the Home authori-
ties. So far, however, from being extinguished, Sir
George Grey was now placed on a higher pinnacle
of popularity; ho was enabled to exercise a
greater and more beneficial sway over human
minds and a more potent influence over the future
destinies of the country than was possible while
he remained a nominee Governor and a creation of
Downing-street.
On 9th February, 1868, Sir George Bowen
arrived in New Zealand as successor to Sir George
Grey—Bowen after Grey ! ! ! and the latter took
up his residence at the island of Kawau, and next
reappeared as the eloquent and triumphant cham-
pion of Liberalism, not only for New Zealand, but
for Australia.

LADIKS - NIGHT, MONDAYS. 7 till 9.30. In ohar K c of n Lady Professional.
Victoria Regina finds one of the chief
e miforts of her declining years in supervising the
Court Circular, an 1 at intervals her royal foot
goes down scrunch upon the bruised insect who
officiates its sub-editor of that high-toned organ.
Nothing is expected of tjio sub. save strict atten-
tion to detail and a proper capacity for correcting
his Sovereign Lady's orthography, and toivcnuig
up her syntax, which latter is very apt to get
inixe 1. The Queen sends along her “ copy -
written by. a Maid of Honor, or a Groom or the
lied diamber, or some person of that description
to the office in London, where the sub. is waiting
with a wet towel tied round his narrow brow, to
print slips stating that “ Her Majesty took gentle
walking exercise,” and “The Hereditary Grand
Duke Nicotnpoop has left the Castle,' which slips
arc nightly issued to a few London newspapers,
previous to being collected into a solemn weekly
i sue of the Circular. When the Queen happens
to lie staying at Windsor, she gloats over her
handiwork each morning, and if any German
prince has lost a few of his titles in t ie setting-up
she orders the mistake to be rectified in next day’s
hit of Circular, and when the full edition appears
it is, of course, free from blemish. Sometimes,
however, circumstances over which she has no
control cause an error to appear in the weekly
i isue, the actual official secret of Lngland’s great-
ness. Then, Victoria by the Grace of God, not
deigning to set matters right through the sub-
editor, sends telegrams direct to the daily papers
from Scotland, or Germany, or wherever she was
.• laying when the awful mistake occurred, and the
sub. turns pale as he secs a paragraph of this
description glaring 1 at him from the columns of
the Morning Post— “the statue of the late
Emperor Frederick of Germany was unveiled by
the Queen on Thursday last, immediately before,
and not after, the last anthem was sung in the
service which was performed, as was errone-
ously stated in the Court Circular. ihe
Queen’s correction is wrongly worded, and, from
a literary point of view, isn’t a correction at all,
but it makes her sub. feel bad.
The strangest story in all Mr. Stevenson s
works is told in his recent letters from the Mar-
quesas, where a nation is dying out because it
feels too tired to live. The Marquesans have felt
tired ever since the white men came into the
Pacific, and they arc dropping away merely
because they have lost all interest in existence. V
Marquesan can die of melancholy in two days
when he starts, and it takes very little to start
him—if his girl looks coldly on him, or he
loses a pig, or anyone throws a little bad language
at him, he goes home and fades away. And,
stranger still, it is ten chances to one that the
man next door will catch the infection, and sit
down uncomplainingly on a stool and evaporate in
the same aimless way, ami presently adozenmoie
inhabitants will begin to wither up, till the whole
settlement becomes depopulated from an epidemic
of long-drawn-out dreariness. If a Marquesan
thinks he has got a new disease he is too tired and
patient and weary to go home ; he simply sits
down by the wayside and waits till ho dies, even
if he has to wait 14 days, and if lie hasn’t got any
disease he dies all the same through too much
melancholy resignation. He isn’t particular about
his disease either; any complaint he can die
of is the complaint he has got. The nation
has given up work of recent years because
everybody feels that there is nothing on all this
wide, exhausted earth that is worth worrying
about. They live on wild fruit, and hang round
miserably, and sigh, and exchange symptoms, and
swap solemn thoughts about the Hereafter, and
they hide themselves under the bed or in any
other handy corner at night because they dread
the ghosts of their ancestors. They are a big.
brawny, muscular race, in the last stage of mental
fatigue and collapse —a nation that is dying for
want of a drunk, and a scrimmage. _ Many a
half-extinct tribe might be save 1 from immediate
destruction by arousing dog-fight, and a vigorous
contest among six cats would be, sufficient to call
a Marquesan from his death-bed and give him a
fresh lease of existence ; but in these sleepy islands
there are no dog-fights, and when the iiati\ c is
disgusted with existence there is nothing to cheer
him up except a lazy pig mooning on the sands.
They don’t drink and they don t swear, neither
do they fight or eat each other ; they wash them-
selves regularly, and are friendly with all comers,
and the only other thing they do is to lie round
and die unaccountably.
FREETRADE OR PROTECTION.
Some vote Protection, some Freetrade,
As best for this young country’s weal.
But ask the youth or blushing maid,
And each will answer — Pemell’s Meal
As best, because it has been tried,
There’s nothing half so good beside.
His Golden Meal is what I mean,
’Tis good and pure and cheap, I wean.
Those who think that Goddard would make a
good show against Slavin' should pause. His lights with
Dooley and Choytiski prove that any man of aveia.e
cleverness can hit him easily anyhow and anywhere.
Now, how many hard blows from Slavin, or say Sullivan,
cmid Goddard stand ? Goddard showed well with Jack-
son, because Peter is not a hard hitter, and though he.got
home often enough there was no powder behind, and his
want of condition told after the opening rounds.
A Melbourne journalist truly observes that
“ we should lay stress on manners in our State-
schools, because a good deal of hangdog larri kinbm
is due to a consciousness of uncouth bearing,
which leads lads to shun decent society.” Deport-
ment, however, is regulated by the brain, and
while “decent society ” doe* its level best to put
“common” people ill at ease, consciousness
of uncouth beiring must continue to form the
most lamentable of all class distinctions.
Mrs. Yorick complained to her lord, the
other day, that the baker’s young man was too
fond of flirting with their now servant. Hear
me,'” said Yorick, “you must put a stop to it
directly.” “Indeed,” replied Mi'. Y., who is
not unobservant, “I had no idea you could bo so
jealous.” It was a keen thrust, and the old man
winced.-—Ex.
At Isisford (Q.) Police-court : 1 AVill you
swear that your husband drank a ease of whisky
in live days?” “He did; I swear to it, your
Worship.” ' “ Will you also swear that he drank
another case of whisky in three days V” -“ Ho did
so ; I swear that.” Sensation in Court. ‘ v aix,

AMERICA’S GREATEST STATESMAN
At one of the large dinners given at the seat of
government lately, the great orator said: “Permit
me, ladies and gentlemen, to say that there is no
drink in the world so conducive to social inter-
course as the famous St. Louis Lager Beer. As
a mental and physical relaxative it has no equal,
ft refreshes the body and exhilarates the mind.
It gently moves the blood to accelerated action,
and arouses the more generous sentiments that
cluster around the human heart. Its action in-
spires noble thoughts, and at the banquet table,
with intellect and genius, it touches chords of
inspiration that prompt to lofty efforts.”

BWOBN CERTIFICATE.—One qf Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
_,, T- 10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kugki.mann, Esq.
Dear Sir, This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but 1 became worse every day, wasting away until
became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter !
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted von and
you told me you oould cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time 1 commenced to improve and
was gaining In weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lun- healedl completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever. ‘
