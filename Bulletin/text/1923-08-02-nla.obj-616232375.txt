Demonstrate the superiority of
MANGROVITE LEATHER or RAW-HIDE BELTING.
In a well-known soap factory an Ordinary Double Raw-
Ilide Mangrovite Belt driving a Lock Cornering machine on
a Particularly difficult drive ran for two years with entire
satisfaction, and has just been replaced by another Man-
grovite Belt that is giving the same fine power-saving
results. The previous best belt service on this machine was
nine months, running with an imported belt.

AFRAID OF FOOD.
Sufferers from indigestion very often become faddists as regards their food, and find
emselves in time reduced to a very meagre and unsatisfying diet. Hudson’s Eumen-
tnot Jujubes correct acidity of the stomach, and their antiseptic properties prevent
a noimal fermentation of the food, thus allowing the natural digestive ferments to act,
and if taken regularly after meals they so
improve the digestion that a strict diet be-
comes unnecessary. Hudson’s Eumenthol
Jujubes are most useful to those who suffer
from Heartburn, Flatulence and Dyspepsia.

Some Guesses at Origins
In the search for the origin of civilisation
the study of such antiquities as exist in the
islands of the Pacific is expected to fill an
important part. A group of scholars
holds that the Nile Valley is the first and sole
source of human culture, and that even the
comparatively high development of Peru and
Mexico will eventually be traced to a con-
nection with Asiatic lands somewhere be-
tween the third and tenth centuries of our
era. That something approaching civilisation
once existed in many islands is certain; but
if the remains of greater years in Peru,
Mexico and Easter Island are all from the
same source they exhibit a versatility on the
part of the invading Asiatics which is very
unlike their work in their own lands. Again,
all Asia in the third century possessed the
art of writing either in more or less phonetic
alphabets or in ideographs. llow, then, did
they carry to Mexico a system of hiero-
glyphics resembling that which they had
themselves discarded at least a thousand
years earlier, and to Peru no written lan-
guage at all, but an amazing mode of keeping
records by knots on pieces of string? With-
out doing more than merely ask those ques-
tions —questions which must suggest them-
selves to every general reader who is inter-
ested in human problems—l should like to
point out that a tremendously important
matter with a real bearing on all archaeology
is being ignored by too many modern investi-
gators. That fact is that Europe had an
alphabet which did not come from the Nile
valley nor from any Asiatic source. Though
very few writings in Ogham exist, and
although these are entirely in the British
Islands, it is a real alphabet and, as such, is
the most striking of all remains of early
European culture. Considering that it took
several thousands of years to turn the first
picture-writing of Egypt into the Greek
alphabet, the mere existence of another form
of writing not derived from it in a north-
western island suggests at once another enor-
mously long cycle of increasing culture on
European soil, or soil once occupied by Euro-
peans. Such a thought might easily lead us
to conjecture that, far from the white man
being the late pupil of the Egyptian and
Asiatic, his own civilisation actually began
earlier than theirs ; for Ireland—where most
of the Ogham inscriptions are found—is
really the treasure-house of European
archa'ology. Alone among the western
nations Ireland missed the domination of
the Roman Empire and the destruction of
ancient landmarks and ideas which such a
domination entailed. It is quite reasonable
to suppose that all ancient western Europe
was very much like ancient Ireland ; and it
is scarcely possible to imagine that Ireland
had an alphabet, fully developed through
long ages, which was never passed on to the
countries across the narrow seas.
The Ogham inscriptions which exist are
on pillars of stone, and extend no farther
east than Hampshire. That is the end of
the story as far as most archaeologists read
it; but it is by no means the end. To this
day in Ireland the alphabet is called by a
name which means “the boards”; and the
inference is that the earliest writing there
was upon wood. But there is more than
inference to go upon. There are very definite
records of ancient bards carrying their songs
upon sticks, not written in characters, but
cut into the wood ; and such cutting would
beyond all question be in Ogham. Ogham is,
in fact, a cut language, not one written with
a pen. The papyrus of Egypt was the paper
of the ancient world ; parchment came along
much later. Europe had no papyrus, but
used instead an alphabet which could be
applied to home-grown material. The angle
of squared wood formed the central stem of
the letters, which consisted of longer or
shorter incisions running to right or left,
either straight or at an angle. By hinging
together, after the fashion of an umbrella
a number of narrow square pieces of wood a
considerable book was formed; and such a
book was no doubt the “stick” which the
ancient bards carried. I would hazard a
brave guess that there was a time when
libraries of those sticks were found from the
Danube to the Shannon, and that not so very
much later than the age of the Pyramids
there was as much human information in
them as on any Egyptian papyrus of the
date. As for the stone pillars with Ogham
inscriptions extending no farther cast than
the middle of the south British coast, it must
be remembered that early Europe did not
use stone to any great extent. Those pillars
may have been a late fashion developed in
Ireland; and the tens of thousands of more
easily carved wooden posts, which represented
the real territory of Ogham, may ages ago
have mouldered to decay. The stone pillars
probably stopped abruptly against the edge
of that devastating war which at some time
broke the continuity of western European
progress.
Where Ogham was first developed is a
question wholly within the realm of conjec-
ture ; but that it was last in the keeping of
Gaelic-speaking people is certain. Find out
the source of the Gael and you will probably
find out the Source of Ogham. We see the
Gael first in an authentic home of his own
exactly where his ancient language is being
revived to-day—with his back to the deep
western ocean. All other Gauls—for Gaul
and Gael are certainly one —were in a state
of flux and movement; battering at the
gates of Rome, over-running the valley of the
Po, sacking Delphi, battling their way into
Asia Minor or moving from the Alps to the
foot of the Pyrenees. But in the west the Gael
was at home; and the amazing thing is that
his own traditions make his chief gods—
which in all tribal traditions mean the tribe
itself—come from the west. And as there is
no likelihood of his having arrived from
America, that west must remain a puzzle,
unless Plato’s Atlantis should at last prove
more than fable. Yet the western story is
borne out by a rathef astonishing association
of place names. All the most ancient place
names of the country that is now England
are in the Cymric language except a thin
line of Gaelic names running from the
Mersey to the Thames—a direct diag-
onal track across Britain (see Taylor,
“Words and Places”). What "does this
mean? It seems to mean that for whole
ages—long enough to permanently establish
the names on the soil —the Gael in Ireland
kept an open line of communication trom
the ports nearest Meath to the continent oi
Europe. Did he then come from some mys-
terious west, after all? Did the host of
Brennus —the god Brian—which took Home,
muster on the plains of Leinster for its
mighty raid on the wineshop of Italy i
According to Mommsen, wine was its objec-
tive. But that is bringing matters to a late
date; and the landing of the Danaans in Ire-
land was probably at least a dozen centuries
earlier. I confess that an origin of European
culture which has nothing to do with either
Thebes or Babylon, the Nile or the Euphra-
tes fascinates me. With Ogham as the key,
the tradition of the western landing
and the word-track from the west in
mind, and the knowledge of all that
a brave belief in so-called mythology led to
in the case of Sehliemann, if I had the chance
to show the white man’s world where its
civilisation began, I think I should go and dig
hard in the Azores. Failing that, I should
tackle Iceland, which had certainly been in
the possession of the Gael before the Norse-
men found it—as is proved by Irish geo-
graphy which is still extant. One thing I
am confident that the future will learn —
the culture which distinctively belongs to
the white man was not learned from either
the black or the brown.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
Pierre Loti
Pierre Loti is dead. His merely human
name was Viaud, and he lived to be 73.
When he died, death must have shown itself
very strong, for in spite of his slight figure
Loti had more than one man’s share of vita-
lity. He was impressionable at every point,
and seemed in his life to contradict the phrase
about the “average sensual man.”
Pierre Loti was not average. His sensual-
ity was as far beyond the average sensual
man’s as his writing surpassed that of the
average reporter. His senses, even suppos-
ing they were only the normal five, were all
abnormally keen, and his brain and finally his
pen registered their impressions. To read
and re-read one of his books is to move in a
world that can be touched at every point of
the story. You can see round the sharp cor-
ners of it and behind the stone walls. In
his novel of the north coasts of Brittany,
“Pecheurs d’lslande,” you yourself move on
the blue waters among the honeycomb of little
islands outside the harbor villages. You real-
ise the rose-granite coast “in clearer and
better light than the perishing mortal eye
can see.” You actually forget that the imagi-
nation is Loti’s, and the toil of its expression.
Consider Loti’s dates. His work is late
19th century, and he takes the qualities of
his period with both hands, being realistic and
romantic. It was not to him, but to De
Maupassant, that Flaubert gave the famous
advice about the need of some clearly-observed
detail in any descriptive writing, yet Loti
might be another disciple. When he de-
scribes a eabhorse it is an individual horse,
set in its special circumstances that (pace
Nietzsche and the repetitionists) never recur.
When he writes of the bombardment and de-
struction of llheims cathedral, he is one in
spirit with its aged bishop whose heart is
breaking, and at the same time he is almost
childishly aware of the stones falling froth
the spires, and of how they visibly grow in
size as they near the ground.
In “Ddsenchantees,” that novel of a hesi-
tant and pathetic feminism against a be-
wildering background of the Golden Horn,
he reaches a simple intensity hardly to be
borne. He can write up the obvious “scen-
ery” of such a place with anyone, but his
real power begins after that. If his story
leads his little shadowy heroines into some
small, dusty street, you are there, too, and
feel the sudden significance of every wall
and doorway. You are sure, too, that his
people are important, and follow the curves
of their naive hopes and fears during the
Fresh Water carnival by the Sea of Mar-
mora. “Shall we meet —or may we never
hope for it again?” A desolate little wind
comes over the Marmora, and the season of
carnival with its possibilities of chance-
encounters is over. The little veiled figures
return, through a labyrinth of corridors, to
their ultimate seclusion. It is the concrete
sureness of Loti’s writing that lifts such
a story sheer out of the plane of obvious sen-
timent. As an artist he must have had a
comparatively serene inner life, for he knew
that his real strength lay in a kind of tan-
gible description, and held to it.
So in real life he came to nourish this sen-
sual realism of his. Superfine French maga-
zines have- shown Loti in his French home,
several rooms of which were accurate and
sumptuous reproductions of rooms in the
foreign parts he had loved to describe. There
you had a picture of Loti, en /es, seated in
his Turkish room, all filigree round tables,
brass trays and Byzantine curves. There
was the Indian room, with its scented air.
There was the Japanese room, haunted by
Madame Chrysanthfeme. Perhaps there was
a room a la Tahiti to remind him of his
earliest work, when his craft of sailor had
taken him, more casually than Gauguin, to
the South Seas. “Well, it was all a pose,”
grunted the Philistines, secure and at ease
in their homes, fitted out by sound and regu-
lar purveyors. It was no pose. The por-
trait of Loti remains clear—the small, alert
sailor figure, the clear-cut face and dark, de-
tached eyes, the impersonal, searching eyes
of the devout artist.

A Delayed Renaissance
C. E. Bechofer’s The Literary Renaissance
in America (Ileinemann) is an attempt to
supply the answer to a question which thou-
sands have been asking insistently since the
war brought home to the world the material
vastness of the U.S.A. Why has this coun-
try bounded ahead in almost everything save
culture during the past quarter of a century v
The English writer’s reply is that there has
been a literary advance, though admittedly
a little one. He begins, oddly enough, with
the critics—ll. L. Mencken, G. J. Nathan
Randolph Bourne—and only devotes about
two-thirds of his book to the creative artists

David Jones’, Opp. G.P.0., Sydney
his first exhibit in the latter class. Cabeil
produced an enormous amount of work
novels, short stories, essays and poems—be-
fore “Jurgen” arrived to make him famous.
And then the New York Sun remarked that
"with time and experience, aided by the sym-
pathetic appreciation of the reviewer, Mr.
Cabell will doubtless learn,” while the New
York Society for the Suppression of Vice de-
clared the book to be “obscene, lewd, lasci-
vious and indecent,” and for nearly a year
had it suppressed. James Hergesheimer,
Eugene O’Neill (whom the author considers
“the greatest living dramatist”), Theodore
Dreiser (who, like Cabell, received the tri-
bute of an attack by the New York Society
for the Suppression of Vice) and Sinclair
Lewis (to whom Bechofer dedicates his
book) are also discussed at length.
The selected list of notabilities affords
proof in itself that, even if a renais-
sance has appeared in America, it is not
American. Mencken and Nathan are wits,
critics of a high order, and at times remark-
able literary artists; but they are not Ameri-
cans. Their intellectual outlook is cosmopoli-
tan as that of, say, Max Beerbohm, who
lives in Italy, never has been ; and eight times
out of ten they are anti-American. Bourne s
work discloses the same spirit of resentment
and internationalism. “Jurgen” is a romance
which is no less European in form and in-
spiration than “Gil Bias” or “The Legend
of Ulenspiegel.” Hergesheimer is so like his
master, Conrad, that at his best—as in “Java
Head”—he is almost indistinguishable from
the Anglo-Polish writer. And Dreiser has
modelled himself faithfully on Arnold Ben-
nett. Sinclair Lewis, the scarifier of the
philistinism of the Middle West, sounds a
note which is superficially American. But
it is not authentic: it is not American, as
the voice of Thackeray was English or as
that of Balzac was French. Lewis consis-
tently looks at his figures through the deri-
sive eyes of a foreigner. He never laughs
at America affectionately from the inside as
Mark Twain did in “Tom Sawyer” :he jeers
at it from the outside as Mark Twain jeered
at Europe in “The Innocents Abroad.”
Eugene O’Neill remains as the only writer
approximating to greatness in the U.S.A. to-
day who, carrying the stamp of his country
of origin, strikes us as incapable of boast-
ing, like Nathan, “I can write as well and as
happily in Europe as in the U.5.A.,” and
who does not appear to be thinking of settling
down in London as Sinclair Lewis has done.
So it is evident that, in spite of the hand-
ful of glittering names which C. E. Bechofer
is able to cite, anything resembling a national
renaissance as it has been understood for
centuries in the older countries is still to
seek in the U.S. An explanation is
to be found in the traditional Ameri-
can craze for prohibiting things—and
more especially opinions—and this, too,
may explain the note of hostility, even con-
tempt, which is expressed for America by
so many first-class American minds. The
self-styled “land of the free” is more con-
trolled and regimented in the spiritual sense
than any of the monarchical countries. Upton
Sinclair has just written a book on the
American educational system, from which it
appears that practically every radical-minded
University professor in the country who has
been rash enough to express his political or
social views has paid for it with the loss of
his job—a matter of the American Univer-
sities being bossed by rich business men. A
literary censorship of the disastrous type
that has lately become active here is in full
and effective operation in America. As with
us, the censors are mostly officials without
the capacity to distinguish between literature
and pornography, and their worst excesses
in the way of repression have the support of
professional purity-mongers such as Billy
Sunday and of the yellow press. In an atmo-
sphere of this kind it is almost impossible for
a virile and individual literature to grow up.
For an audience the intelligentsia of the
country have to turn largely to the foreign
market, and consequently they speak now
with the voices of Englishmen and now like
Germans or Frenchmen, and are usually dis-
closed as their native land’s most merciless
critics.
J. B. D.
An Almost Forgotten Revolution
Australia has a numerous and noisy col-
lection of revolutionists these days, and they
are hopeful with the hopefulness of inex-
perience, and amateurish to a degree. They
look only to success, without the least idea
that success is often the worst and most irre-
trievable thing that can happen. It is bad
for those concerned when the revolution
fails, but it may be worse when it comes off
and proves to be the wrong revolution. That
is as depressing as the situation in which
the elopement and the midnight marriage
are brought off in the face of all diificulties,
and then daylight reveals that it is a differ-
ent girl—and she a hag with no money. In the
Old Testament can be found the long-drawn-
out story of a revolution which, when pieced to-
gether, makes more grotesque reading than
anything Gilbert ever concocted, though no
Sullivan has set it to music. The dramatic
possibilities of Holy Writ are not rightly
appreciated.
When the curtain rose Solomon was reign-
ing over a greater empire than fell to any
Jew before or since. It included, as a. small
nucleus, the original land of the Twelve
Tribes; a terrace of annexed kingdoms on
the east; in the north the jewel-city of
Damascus, and a rich area beyond, stretch-
ing to the Euphrates. It might be called the
world’s Great Power in the making. There
was some discontent in re Solomon, who had
too many wives and under-wives —a thousand
in all, he having laid in a three years’ sup-
ply. Also lie kept too many gods, and levied
too many taxes. Still it doesn’t appear that
anything was incurably or even seriously
amiss until a prophetic revolutionary (one
of a class with inspired hair, wild eyes and
long bare brown legs, very prevalent at the
time) began to mix in politics.
A notable stunt of the earlier prophet was
greasing people’s heads. Three times one
of the tribe, having become huffed with the
reigning monarch, rushed at some prominent
citizen, and, apparently without giving him
any choice in the matter, declared the
dynasty to be out of print, and said that
Jehovah hereby anointed the new man and
his descendants to reign in its stead. Then
lie vanished round the corner, leaving the
prominent citizen to shift for himself in
rather embarrassing circumstances. When
a wild, backblocky-looking character, assumed
to be more or less sacred, charged into the
Bank of N. S. Wales, and anointed the
ledger-keeper, saying lie was divinely
appointed general-manager and was to enter
on his duties immediately, unpleasantness
could hardly be avoided. The cause of the
trouble, with the tail of his brown robe flee-
ing skittishly across the tram-line, might not
feel it, but those he left behind him did. An
individual who makes only two appearances
in Scripture perpetrated this unseemly jest
on Jeroboam, apparently a brilliant soldier
and a capable and loyal administrator, and
started affairs moving as cheerfully as an in-
fant who puts a burning match into an oil
refinery to hear it fizzle.
Then the first sparks of the revolution
began to fly. Solomon set out briskly to end
the trouble by killing the Pretender, who
seemingly didn’t in the least want to pretend,
but had had the job forced on him. Jero-
boam, being thus shunted suddenly and vio-
lently up against it, left his country, and his
billet and salary and career, also his house
and furniture and the heavier part of the
family plate, and ran for Egypt. There he
seems to have lived on a dole from the local
king, who doubtless thought he might be
useful, and bit his fingernails beside the
Nile (a habit that any gentleman might
acquire in the circumstances), and became
sour against prophets and kings and the
globe in general. Back in Palestine the
king’s government grew no better for the
loss of a capable servant, and Jeroboam’s
own tribe grew no more affable for the mal-
treatment of its favorite son. All this time
the prophet, so far as the evidence goes, ate
three meals per day as usual, and never once
regarded himself as something of a mud-
head.
Solomon died, a very old man of 58, leav-
ing a small tired volume in which he declared
that nothing was worth anything. Under
his son, Rehoboam Solomonson, the revolu-
tion came. The position of Jeroboam Nebat-
son was that, owing to the prophet, he had
to be a king, a remittance man or a dead
body, and he took a shot at being a king.
But with a strong Jew pulling hard at each
end the mother country came apart. Jero-
boam got the big end of the wishbone (ten
Tribes), and Rehoboam got the small end
(two Tribes). Theoretically the revolution
was a success, but events showed that it
would nave succeeded much better if it had
failed.
It was in keeping with the rest of the
comic-opera mix-up that the prophet promptly
decided that he had anointed the wrong king,
after all. Jeroboam had been nominated as
a protest against Solomon’s idolatry, anu
Jeroboam proved a spiritual dud, being an
idolator himself. In his favor it must be
said that he was again the sport of circum-
stances. He couldn’t be really orthodox
unless he went to pray in the temple in his
rival’s capital, and he would have been shot
if he had gone. Yet a local church of some
sort was essential. All the same, the unrea-
soning prophet made his second and last
appearance upon any stage to deliver a
mighty curse on the man whose peaceful life
he had spoiled.
Naturally, the first act of the two kings
after the disruption was to mobilise in self-
protection. Their successors mobilised also.
While wars and skirmishes went on, the
jewel-city of Damascus, the pride and glory
of the realm, set up as the capital of a new
empire which overshadowed both Hebrew
States. At the same time minor conquered
kingdoms resumed their independence. In
fact, the dominion which Solomon inherited
divided into five or six, and they scrapped
for over 300 years with each other, and with
sixth and seventh parties who chipped in on
finding that the fight was open to all. And
when they were worn to rags certain parties
from further east came and ate them all up.
A growing empire which might have made
Persia and Rome superfluous passed out by
reason of a one-horse preacher who, like our
own Garden, took a fancy for revolutionary
politics. Now Syria makes pickles in Red-
fern or Surry Hills (Sydney), and Judah
pawnbrokes in Castlereagh-street, and Israel
has been mislaid, and the tail-end of the
tragedy has hardly even the merit of being
picturesque.
Unless a revolution is insured against acci-
dent in a good office it is best left alone.
JAMES EDMOND.
Australian Art
“P.L.” further considers art and dogma:—
“C.R.8.” admits (R.P. 19/7/’23) that my state-
ment of the case for Meidrum seems “logical and
reasonable enough.” Why, then, seek to dismiss
it as “gusty reiteration,” etc. ?. Had my critic
set out to disprove my statements both he and
I, as well as many others, might have learned
something valuable. The attempt to discover what
is truth is surely better than resignation to the
idea that because nobody knows for certain what
truth is, it is unlikely that anybody ever will. The
achievementsin the sciences should leave us very
glad that they have not been hampered by such
a notion.
I think “C.R.8.” has too hastily judged my atti-
tude towards Australian art. I am conscious of
being somewhat fanatical in my belief that our
artists, aided by the critics, are wasting too much
time and energy in proving their greatness, and
spending too little in a diligent search for what
is true art. My appeal to take Meidrum more
seriously was simply the outcome of a conviction
that the acceptance of the new-old principles which
he has unearthed would make Australian art stronger
than it is. My respect for the native powers of
Lambert, Heysen, Griiner and many other artists is
as great as it is for Meldrum’s. If their work,
despite the height it often reaches, fails to leave me
completely convinced, I neither put it down as my
fault nor “superiorly dismiss Lambert as a mere
draughtsman and shudder dreadfully before the land-
scapes of Griiner and Heysen.” Being anxious to do
all the critic should do, I attempt to leave emotion
and the personal element out in order to make a
careful comparison of the Lambert, Griiner and Hey-
sen paintings with what is produced by other artists
with other creeds. If the Meidrum school seems to
provide what is missing in the work of the rest, I
do not make the mistake of under-valuing the rest
merely because many disciples of Meldrum’s school
consider all outsiders idiots. In spite of their vanity
their school appears sounder than the others, and I
naturally therefore desire to point out to Australian
art generally the virtues of Meldrum’s principles.
I don’t know much about music, but I believe
with “C.R.8.” that Beethoven is greater than
Debussy. This does not mean that I do rot appreci-
ate the beauties of Debussy, but it dees force me to
the conclusion that the principles Beethoven em-
ployed would be the soundest on which to build a
national school of music.
“C.R.8.” objects “to the narrowing influence of
intellectual eliquejsm.” Personally I cannot see
how either “narrowing influence” or “cliqueism”
applies to the believers in Meldrum’s new-old prin-
ciples any more than they do to those scientists who
accept what proofs there are that Einstein has dis-
covered an absolute law in relativity. Meidrum has
gone a long way to prove that relativity is no less
the mother law of art than of other things. If he
cannot be proved wrong, and does challenge all we
have previously believed in, what are we going to do
about it ? Accept the law he has rediscovered and
build according to it, or refuse to consider it because
we believe ourselves superior to all laws? Surely
the extreme schools of art are sufficient evidence that
the latter way inevitably leads to chaos—a return to
the beginning of things. Creeds come and go, as
“C.R.8.” indicates, but this fact does not prove
anything more than that man is constantly swinging
forwards and backwards between an acceptance of
logic and a denial of it and a belief in his supposed
supernatural powers. All conscious artists are worth
any person’s cultivated attention; but surely if the
artist has something to say it does matter more
than a dump “what methods are employed” to say
it. Much depends on his choice of method whether
he will say it convincingly or otherwise.
If “C.R.8.” saw any bitterness or arrogance in
my article, then either be unconsciously read them
into it, or I failed in my attempt to keep the sug-
gestion of both out.
A Satchel of Books
Tim Australian- Museum Magazine, which aims at
inspiring all good Australians to take an interest
in the natural history of their country and the
adjacent islands, seems now to be well on its feet.
Only nine numbers have been issued so far, and
already the first, published at a shilling, is selling
at near the pound. The July issue is well up to
standard, the contents ranging from an article
on whales, by Prof. T. Thompson Flynn—with par-
ticular reference to some remarkably fine fossil
remains recently found near Wynyard (Tas.) —to
a quaint wasp that sees to the fecundation of
Australian fig-trees.
The Heinemann house is producing, under the
editorship of the indefatigable Edmund Goose, a series
of “Masterpieces of French Romance.” Two volumes
to hand are Madame Bovary (Flaubert) and The
Nabob (Daudet). The translation in each case is
conscientiously done and catches as nearly as may
be the spirit of the original. Henry James supplies
a fine critical introduction to the Flaubert novel, and
Prof. Trent deals likewise with Daudet, while the
editor supplies a compendious biographical note in
each volume. It promises to be a fine series.
An Australian Bird Book, by J. A. Leach, D.Sc.
(Whitcombe and Tombs). A fifth edition, revised
and enlarged so that what was originally “a pocket
book for field use” becomes “a complete guide to
the identification of Australian birds.” With the
supplement of 30 pages (51 illustrations) there is
now a full list of birds resident in Australia, regular
visitors thereto, and the introduced birds that have
established themselves ; and the informative “lecture” is
all the time throwing illumination on the tabulated
matter. There has also been added a table, handy
to the beginner, showing the page on which any bird
of a given size may be found. All the admirable
colored plates a-re retained, and no more useful
volume is at the disposal of the bird-lover.
Rule of Three, by Esther Dean (John Lane). The
story of an incredible ass who married the wrong
man. They made a wretchedly poor struggle to
accommodate themselves to one another, and the
farce ended in a couple of years by the man arrang-
ing matters with the third party, who had been a
good deal of an ass, too, though we are presumably
expected to regard her as the heroine. Such books
may do some good in suggesting that young people
should think harder before they marry; but they
might do more if they suggested the serious conse-
sequences of dfvorce. Occasionally perhaps nobody
is hurt; but nine times out of ten somebody is hurt
badly. True, he (or she, or they) might be worse
hurt if there were no divorce; but that doesn’t
make divorce a good thing—it merely makes it the
less bad of two bad things.
Salvage, by Bernard Cronin (Hodder and Stough-
ton). In his “Twenty Years in Paris,” Robert Sher-
ard mentions some wonderful old port which a
connoisseur described as sliding down your throat
like the Almighty in velvet trousers. According to
Bernard Cronin’s yarn, some similarly ravishing fluid
went down with the Santa Douro, a Portuguese
vessel, when she was wrecked on the Tasmanian
coast in 1840. During a holiday a waspish patent-
attorney named Simms finds the old wreckage, and
recovering a bottle of the wine learns all about the
lost cargo. The rest of the book deals with the
conflict between Simms’s party and a rival squad
of adventures for the salvaging of the treasure,
and Cronin’s striking narrative gift gives an air
of singular credibility to the tale. Also the writing
is more competent and more expressively colored
than it was in his previous good sellers, “The Coast-
landers” and “Timber Wolves.”
My Journey Round the World, by Lord North-
c-liffe (John Lane). Northcliffe was a sick man,
and that may in some measure explain why there
is less color in the “Journey’s” 300 pages than a
Northcliffe editor would demand in a report of a
Test cricket match. Rotorua is “the most interest-
ing place for a holiday other than London or Paris
that I know of.” Yet Northcliffe’s most lyric out-
burst on the subject of it is: “The more I study
the volcanic eruptions here, the mudholes and the
geysers, the more weird I find them. It is like
Niagara—it grows upon one.” The Sydney climate
is “like Riviera” ; a vista in Saigon is “like that
overlooking the fountains at Versailles” ; “the Nal-
dera is not unlike the Aquitania.” Nowhere does
the writer disclose himself as one iota more percep-
tive or profound than the average elderly, waggish,
golf-mad and slightly fatuous Englishman of wealth
who may be met any day on any liner. His geni-
ally malicious use of Frederick the valet is charac-
teristic. Frederick should have been drastically
sub-edited. The author touches on only three debat-
able questions—the underpopulation of Australia,
the militarism and land hunger of Japan, arid the
Zion experiment—and he has nothing revealing, nor
new nor helpful, to say about any of them. Alto-
gether the work is an apotheosis of the commonplace.
Celebrities; Little Stories oj Famous Folk, by
C'oulson Kernahan (Hutchinson). Yarns about Sara
Bernhardt, Beerbohm Tree, Shaw, Swinburne, lan
Maclaren and other more or less popular characters
discursively written by a man who has a genius for
cultivating valuable friendships. One is often irritated
by the author’s parenthetical wanderings, but, after
battling through the verbiage, one occasionally alights
upon an anecdote that is really worth telling. There
is a smart little reminiscence of Beerbohm Tree,
who, after he had been filmed in a certain play,
went around expressing his delight at having “for
the first time seen myself act.” Comyns Carr, to
whom this was repeated, replied: “I congratu’ate
you, Tree, for, by the living God, you are the only
soul who ever did.” A new one about Shaw relates
that, when the Superman discanted on his superiority
to Shakspeare at a literary dinner, F. C. Gould, the
cartoonist, got up and said that the Irishman’s speech
reminded him of “the flashing of an advertisement of
Beecham’s pills upon the glorious old pile of West-
minster Abbey.” A specially long chapter is devoted
to Shaw’s monkey tricks at the “Trial of John Jasper
for the Murder of Edwin Drood.” The proceedings
had been arranged by the Dickens Fellowship, and
Shaw was the foreman of a jury composed of
William Archer, W. W. Jacobs, Pett Ridge, Tom
Gallon and other literary lights. G. Iv. -Chesterton
was the Judge, but the whole business was cleverly
guyed by Shaw, who, without consulting his fellow
jurors, brought in a verdict of manslaughter, ex-
plaining that, “following the tradition and practice
of British juries, we arranged our verdict in the
luncheon interval.”

Lady Jane.
Down the alley goes Lady Jane,
Down the alley and back again,
A saintly figure in saintly clothes,
Scattering sunshine as she goes.
And every child in the alley cries:
“What shall we do when our Lady dies?”
Lady Jane in a cool white gown
Bringing her flowers into town —
Golden roses the Lady grew,
Bright with color and drenched with dew.
And every child in the alley cries :
"What shall we do when our Lady dies?”
Peals of laughter from silver bells,
These are the things the Lady sells;
In at a door and out again,
Giving pleasure and buying pain.
And every child in the alley cries :
“What shall we do when our Lady dies?”

The Whistle.
If I should kneel and whistle very low
Above his grave, maybe
Deep down amid the stony clay he’d know
And yearn to me ;
And find dear comfort that I long to bring,
And whimper once that I
Might know that he, too, was remembei’ing
Good days gone by.
And so beside his grave I often kneel
When day is growing dim,
And whistle there that he may know and feel
My love of him ;
And know how much I miss him, and how
much
I hope he’ll understand
My need of his black muzzle’s warm, wet
touch
Against my hand.

My Lady Night.
My Lady Night is subtle and elusive.
Her jewels are mystic, magic, mocking
things;
A pale cornelian clasps her clouded mantle,
And moon-washed sapphires stud her shin-
ing rings.
Sometimes a city lends a garish lustre,
The flaming rubies of a courtesan,
Great peacock stones, the sullen glint of
opals,
To gem the silver meshes of her fan.
My Lady Night, who counts the moon a
bauble,
And culls a planet for her gay aigrette.
Who films the Milky Way with floating
smoke-wreaths
Blown from the sparkle of her cigarette.

Lord, gather Thou handfuls of raindrops,
Full fraught with earth’s gladness and

Distil, Lord, the spirit from out them
And pour back the waters again;
Then give me that spirit, O Master,
And wrest from the hot sap of Spring
The fervor that governs its rising,
And give me the wind’s joyous swing;
The sorrow the sea knows and voices,
The splendor of wrath of the sea,
Soft tintings and textures of blossoms,
The slim curve of grass-blade and tree,
Dark shadows and radiant color,
And laughter and love, free and wild;
Then grant that my body may weave them
To the soul and the form of a child !

Reincarnation.
I shall return. I see Life’s fountains leap,
And I am thirsty as the hart that pants
For water brooks in an encircling wood.
Oh, measure shaken down and running o’er!
Oh, curious vessel seething to the brim!
I must drink of you till I taste the dregs;
And when that taste is bitter in my mouth,
When summer’s dead leaves whirl about my
soul —
When I am self-fulfilled like autumn fields —
Oh, then the strong cord will no longer bind,
And up and onward, as the fire sparks go,
And swans, and swallows, and the so,uls of
men,
I shall fare forth !....
Within my hollow hands
I hold a sphere whose visions change like
smoke:
Old streets that wind like water-hewn
ravines.
With closed, secretive shutters; balconies,
Little and crazy-railed, set high above ;
And some strait tunnel where a door ajar
Betrays through one bright chink a garden
court —
Sunshine through leaves, gold-green like
chrysolite,
A weathered faun, a fountain, and the drip
Of tinkling water from the faun’s stone
urn....
I would fain dwell in such a street as this. ..
I want, O Life, the molten love that strikes
ruke blinding summer lightninsr through the
frame,
■When nerves, like water, quiver at a touch
And the soul blossoms, and the world is
dead....
Let me know love where life unbarriered
Runs like a reckless horse with bridle free —
The crash of music, and the cry of death !
The bright, deep red of roses, wine and
blood !
A famished panther whimpers in my
heart....
I shall return. There is no thirst but finds
The swift, sweet torrent. That which
fashioned me
Sends into Space and Time no goalless shaft.

THE CRAZE FOR EXTRA-LEGALITY.
Last week N. S. Wales was offered the spec-
tacle of an ex-Attorney-General petitioning
the State Government to boycott Norman
Lindsay as an exhibitor in Sydney, and pre
vent him from showing his pictures in the
Australian section of the Empire Exhibition
in London. Not a single authoritative voice
was raised in protest. This, however, should
surprise no one. The most ominous after-
effect of the war, which was supposed to
have been fought for freedom and the rule
of law, is the appearance of Prussianism
amongst those who set out to kill Prussian-
ism. A generation has grown up all over the
world which, having been nurtured on war
legislation and government by proclamation
and reference, knows little or nothing of the
principles on which the liberties of civilised
States are founded. Extra-legality, formerly
abhorred by all good Britishers, is accepted
as a natural device for dealing with any
manifestation which happens to be distasteful
to a section. The lese-majeste which con-
sisted of smiling at the fads of a Kaiser
has been replaced by lese-majeste against the.
views of Purity League or Empire Alliance
presidents. Italy’s Fascist leader, whose
methods are admittedly those of the Bol-
shevik leaders, recently voiced an evangel
to which thousands of one-time Liberals are
subscribing:—
Fascism is not afraid to declare itself illiberal or
anti-liberal. It has already passed, and if necessary
will pass again, without the slightest hesitation, over
the body, more or less decomposed, of the Goddess
of Liberty.
It was in keeping with this new spirit that
an Argus writer tolerantly discussed the
proposal to import the Ku Klux Klan to
Australia:—
The project is being looked at from various angles.
Those discussing it arc members of various patriotic
societies. The women’s clubs have not yet taken it
up on any set discussion, but one will do so shortly.
The public mind, vitiated by years of war
propaganda, is ready to be stampeded by any
adventurer posturing as Imperialist or Com-
munist, moralist or prohibitionist; and while
the mood lasts insane things are liable to
be done, and ruinous precedents created. A
recent press campaign against Norman Lind-
say’s art is, of course, the explanation of the
latest move to injure if not ruin him profes-
sionally. But a similar campaign might be
organised by the same illiterate fanatics
against grand opera, the drama, dancing, surf-
batliing or any other at present legitimate
activity. And if so the same methods of re-
pression would be resorted to: a complaisant
Executive would be called on to punish
people for offences unknown to the law. In
the circumstances it is high time Australians
realised where such indulgences are likely
to lead them.
❖ * ■* -x-
The N. S. Wales Government is perfectly
competent to boycott Norman Lindsay. If
it hesitated to rely on its strength—if Premier
Fuller did not dare to be a Lenin i r a Mus-
solini for the occasion—it might, by starting
one of those press riots which may be engi-
neered with equal ease in connection
with the burning of a Union Jack or
the search for a suspected murderer, snatch
from Parliament a sort of legal license to
persecute him. Something of the sort (the
Droit Administrate ) is in permanent force in
parts of the European Continent. In France
a Minister who interferes with a citizen’s legal
rights is not liable: in fact, while acting in
his capacity of Minister, he is virtually free
from the jurisdiction of the Courts. The
British way was exemplified in the recent
O’Brien case. There the erring Minister, in
order to escape the penalties of prcemunire
(which include loss of estate and imprison-
ment) had to secure a special Indemnity Act
from Parliament. The Lenins and Musso-
linis of the war-crazed regions of Europe
do not require the authority of Parliament,
either to authorise a proposed outrage or to
justify one when it has been done without
authority. If the work of (say) an artist
displeases one of the dictator’s supporters,
the offender is executed, deported, thrashed
or dosed with castor-oil, all according to the
degree of displeasure excited. The catch in
this system is that it can only be operated
by an overwhelmingly strong administration.
Nothing in this world is surer than that
Lenin and Mussolini will fall if they do not
presently die. And in either event their most
energetic officials will promptly be subjected
to the pains and indignities which they for-
merly inflicted on the weak. For extra-
legality, being founded on hatred.and con-
tempt of human rights, breeds such send
ments wherever it operates. What happens
when extra-legality weakens was indicated in
a Sun cable a few days ago :
In response to the appeal of the Social Democratic
and Communist parties and the trade unions, 100,000
people took part yesterday at Frankfort-on-Main in
a demonstration against usury and Fascism. The
house of the Public Prosecutor, Dr. Haas, was ran-
sacked. Dr. Haas was beaten to death.
* * « -V
Turn from these jungle forms of govern-
ment to the British system—a system from
which many wooden-headed Tories are turn-
ing, to the obvious gratification of our pro-
fessional revolutionaries. In the United
Kingdom Government officials have no dis-
cretionary powers to punish those who are
objectionable to a party or sect or social
organisation. There is no place in this
august scheme of things for the crank boil-
ing with political, religious or moral fury
or for the scoundrel boiling with a desire
for cheap advertisement. Agitators, artists,
archbishops—all are on the same footing.
The Government takes no notice of their
doings unless they are accused of breaking
the law of the land. When so accused they
have to be charged according to a set form.
And not till they have been convicted before
a legally-constituted Court does the question
of punishment arise. The solitary feature
of the Irish envoys’ trouble which gave their
Communist backers of the Donald Grant
type an arguable case lay in the fact that
action was taken against them without a
conviction being secured against them. Nor-
man Lindsay’s pictures are illegal, or they
are not. If they are, a law exists which is
capable of dealing with them and him:
if they are not a Government has
no more right to hamper their sale
that it has to discriminate against a
hat-malcing or boot-retailing business. The
reason why the best minds of Britain have
insisted on the principle of rigid legality for
centuries is not because they approve of
those who politically, pictorially or otherwise
shock the multitude, or sections of it. Their
objective is order—the discouragement of
anarchy. If anarchy, which is bred of dis-
content, is to be obviated, there must be
security as regards legitimate freedom of
action. It is of no concern to the citizen
affected whether a discretionary power to
punish him extra-legally is assumed by a
king or by a Minister. Injustice is no more
tolerable when perpetrated with the autho-
rity of a Parliamentary majority than it is
when done with the authority of a standing
army. What the citizen requires, for his
own comfort and the peace of the country
in which he lives, is a set of more or less
static rules which have been drawn up b.\
people very like himself, which he under-
stands and reveres, and which he cheerfully
abides by for those reasons. It is these rules
that the bureaucrats who are the despots
of the modern world are continually striving
to overcome and discredit. Many of them
mean well, as kings such as Charles I. did.
But inevitably the attempt to substitute kings’
rules or Ministers’ rules for the law, which
embodies the equity sense of the nation,
must lead to disaster. Let Australia’s public
men forget the glittering despotism of W. M.
Hughes, and get back to strict legality.
Only therein does national safety lie.
THE SWINDLE OF THE U.S. FILM.
From the country where emigrant Austra-
lians are refused admission if they exceed
the fixed limit of 279 a year, and which, as
recently cabled, is imposing prohibitive
duties on Australian-made fencing-wire and
wire-netting, Australia annually imports
from 15 to 20 million feet of cinematographic
film. In 1920-21 15} million feet came in,
and the value on which duty was collected
was-declared at £205,851; in 1921-22 the
footage was 204 millions, and the declared
value £257,742. On these quantities, and
those brought from other countries (a trifle
over two million feet each year), £88,845 was
paid to the Customs Department in 15120-21
and £115,752 in 1921-22. These amounts
are sinfully small considering the profits
wrung from Australia by Adolph Zukor, the
Paramount man ; Carl Laemlle, of the Uni-
versal Co.; and other brisk boys of the bull-
dog breed. They are grotesquely dispropor-
tionate to the revenue paid by the Australian
tobacco manufacturers on their imported raw
material. On 17,104,0001 b. of raw tobacco
landed in Australia last year (16,374,0001 b.
was of American origin) £1,740,176
was collected by the Customs in duties
ranging from Is. 6d. to ss. 4d. per
lb., the value being declared at £2,178,000.
In 1920-1021 £1,642,493 was exacted by
the Department on 21,954,0001 b. of raw
tobacco, of which Samuel’s country
supplied 201 million lb. Roughly, there is
a pound of U.S. tobacco for every foot of
U.S. film, and although the tobacco has to
be worked up in Australian factories, where-
as the film goes straight into competition
with the productions of Australian studios
(the dice being loaded in its favor), the
tobacco is taxed 14 or 15 times as much as
the film. Yet a foot of a popular photo-play
may bring in five to ten times the landed
value of a pound of the Indian weed.
* * * *
The legalised swindle here indicated has
been going on for years. Mention was made
of it in the House of Reps, in 1921, when
the Greene tariff was under discussion.
In a momentary burst of indignation at the
American stranglehold on the Australian
movie market, W. G. Mahony suggested
that ad valorem duties should be clapped on
foreign films, instead of the idiotic lid. a
foot. The Minister weakly replied that he
didn’t see how it could be done. For this
“reason,” among others, that some of the
films were handled by locally-registered com-
panies which remitted all their profits to
“the parent house in America.” Of one of
these locally-registered companies Scott
Fell, M.L.A., has said, without contradic-
tion by the parties concerned, that 9708 of
its 10,000 shares are held by a New York
group. In other cases, the Minister ex-
plained, films were hired from the American
owners and sub-hired to the Australian show-
man (there are 800 of him) for a percentage
of his takings or a royalty, which might be
3d. or 4d. a foot. Generally speaking, the
stuff was “invoiced at the cost of produc-
tion, exclusive of artists and so forth.” In
the light of figures recently published in
U.S. newspapers, this method of valuing the
goods is a unique combination of cheek on
the one part and credulity on the other. A
Trade Commissioner appointed by the Wash-
ington Government has been inquiring into
the operations of the Film Trust. One of
the persons summoned to give evidence was
•T. D. Williams, formerly of Australia but
latterly general manager of the First
National Corporation, whose testimony
showed that the promoted waiters and shop-
girls known as “film-stars” are monstrously
over-paid. Mary Bickford, he said, got
£70,000 for each of three pictures. Norma
Talmadge received £32,000 each for eight
and £70,000 each for twelve. Constance
Talma doe's price was £22,000 for each of
twelve. Then she signed a contract to pos-
ture and simper in twelve more for £30,000
apiece. Katherine Macdonald was paid
£20,000 a picture, Charles Ray the same,
Anita Stewart from £16,000 to £20,000,
and King Vidor £15,000. Even hopeless
actors like Jack Bickford and Mildred
Harris stuck out for £lO,OOO a film. Aus-
tralia is unpleasantly familiar with luscious
advertisements of productions such as “ ‘Dame
and Dervish’ —7000 ft. of Primitive Passion —
the Film that Cost a Million Dollars to
Make.” Under the insane system now in
force a “positive” of “Dame and Dervish” is
valued at £B7 10s. on arrival at Sydney,
and the duty is £43 15s. This illustrates
how the Australian market is closed against
would-be Australian producers, for the pro-
duction cost of a 7000 ft. Australian film
would be £4OOO at least.
* * * *
Commonsense suggests that foreign films
arriving in the Commonwealth should be
taxed on their real value, and not a small
fraction thereof. A statement showing the
total cost of production and the number
of prints in existence should be in-
sisted on in every case, and if the Cus-
toms officers are not satisfied that the true
position has been disclosed they should be
authorised to fall back on a general valua-
tion of, say, 3s. a. foot, instead of 3d., as at
present. Then there should be a protective
duty of at least 40 p.c. on non-British stuff,
the British article to have a 15 p.c. prefer-
ence. And for 10 years, at least, there would
have to be a provision limiting imports of
exposed film in any fiscal year to the quan-
tity produced in the Commonwealth. Until
recourse is had to some such measures there
will never be an Australian film industry
worth talking about. Yet the country has
an unsurpassed climate for picture-produc-
tion, and, apart from the possibilities of an
export trade, there would be a magnificent
home market. A writer in the “Daily Mail
Year Book” asserts that Canada is the
U.S.A.’s best customer for films, but judging
by his own figures (Canada, he says, im-
ported eight million feet of U.S. film in
1922) the inglorious distinction belongs to
Australia. This nation is so addicted to the
movies that it runs more cinema-theatres
than Canada, Belgium, Scandinavia or Cen-
tral America; it actually supports more than
Czecho-Slovakia, Turkey, Holland, Hungary,
Spain and Switzerland put together. It is
calculated that 11,000 Australians are en-
gaged in the distribution and exhibition of
U.S. screen-plays. If Australia made its own
pictures, occupations more useful would be
found for at least three times that number,
for an established film industry is a great
employer of labor. And the London success
of “The Sentimental Bloke” (more than
one newspaper hailed it as the picture of its
year), together with the eminence attained
by Australian screen-actors and producers
in America, shows that, if Parliament rises
to the occasion, the thing can be done. Aus-
tralia has reached the stage where it has
got. to find a lot more home consumers for
its primary produce or something will snap.
It can no longer afford to pay an enormous
annual tribute to the Zukors and Laemlles
of New York and the divorcees and dope
fiends of Los Angeles. Neither can it afford
to let ruffians and decadents fill the minds
of its young people with false and vicious
impressions of life. One of the arguments
in favor of developing a native lilm industry
by the national fiscal policy is that Austra-
lian pictures would foster what American
films tend to denationalise and degrade.
Meaning the Australian spirit.
A JIG-SAW CITY.
While the Sydney Council is rough-hewing
and trimming its streets in a laudable
attempt to create a symmetrical city out
of chaos, it might devote a little of its
time and sagacity to straightening out its
frontiers. For when it comes to defining the
surveyed boundaries, I doubt if there is
anyone who could do it offhand. I am cer-
tain that not one of the 26 aldermen could.
The City is divided into 13 wards. Of
these Denison, l’yrmont and Gipps, being
largely bounded by harbor frontages, are
easy enough to describe. But others are
shocking examples of wild disorder. Bligh
Ward, for example, comprises Darlinghurst
and a part of Vv'oolloomooioo. Starting at
the corner of Riley and Oxford streets, the
boundary line follow's Oxford-street to
Barcom-avenue, then proceeds down Boun-
dary-street to the Bouth Head-road at
Rushcutter’s Bay, up Woolcott-street to
William-street, along William-street to
Riley-street again, and so up to Oxford-
street. That is the rough outline of the
ward, but there are surprising diversions.
Facing Oxford-street, and with Barcom-
avenue on one side of it and Little Barconi-
street on the other, stands the Albury Hotel,
which marks the south-eastern corner of
Bligh Ward where it joins the Paddington
municipality. The actual dividing-line runs
diagonally through the hotel, across !the
yard of an engineering firm, and through a
terrace of dwellings facing Barcom-avenue.
Half the hotel is in Sydney, and half in
Paddington. Some of the front rooms in
the terrace belong to Paddington, while the
kitchens, back yards and dustbins are in
Sydney. Also, as the dividing line
slices through these houses at an angle, the
proportions appertaining to the two muni-
cipalities vary. In the play “Lightnin’,”
popular in Australia a short time back, the
dividing line between two American States
bisected the hero’s shanty, and caused end-
less complications. The idea was borrowed
from one of W. S. Gilbert’s comedies.
Sydney no doubt thought the motif rather
far-fetched, but the Albury Hotel in Oxford-
street is in precisely the same epicene case.
The status of the lodger-elector in that Bar-
com-avenue terrace who occupies a front
bedroom in Paddington, but cooks his matu-
tinal rasher in the kitchen in Sydney, is v.
problem which should set the Revision
Court thinking. Perhaps the position is
provided for under a proportional-voting
clause.
After running through the terrace the
boundary-line dividing Sydney from Padding-
ton crosses Barcom-avenue, and runs along
one side of Boundary-street as far as Glen-
view-street; then it unexpectedly takes to
the middle of the road down to Nield-street,
where it follows the storm-water channel
by the Stadium. Camperdown Ward, the
last district to be added to the city, has erra-
tic borders which Lord Mayor Gilpin, one
of the ward’s representatives, must find diffi-
cult to follow at election-time. Where Cam-
perdown adjoins Petersham the dividing-line
is a supposititious watercourse, Johnston’s
Creek, a stream which disappeared long ago.
The houses facing Cardigan-street are half
in the city and half in Petersham. It is
said that the two councils concerned have
a give-and-take system of rate-collecting,
which arrangement is doubtless convenient
but is probably illegal. Years ago Marrick-
ville Council woke up to the fact that Can-
terbury was cheerfully and enthusiastically
collecting, rates which should have gone into
the Marrickville coffers, but that little com-
plication has since been straightened out
satisfactorily.
The Camperdown boundary crosses Lay-
ton, North wood, Roberts and Hopetoun
streets diagonally. This didn’t matter ver>
much when that locality was open paddocks,
but now the line cuts through dwellings and
back yards. It turns down Hopetoun-lane,
across Australia-street to the production of
the middle of Bishopgate-street, and is, ou
the whole, a lunatic sort of “line.” The
division between Camperdown and Newtown,
between St. Mary’s-street and Railway-
avenue, is a beeline diagonally through
dwellings, back yards, fences and fowlhouseS,
till it is almost impossible to say where one
municipality ends and the other begins. Why
all this tangle and obliquity is not properly
unravelled is a mystery. It certainly helps
to keep Sydney an untidy city.
Flinders Ward, like the State of Massa-
chusetts, is shaped like a gerrymander. Its
boundary runs down Flinders-street from
Oxford-street in the direction of Moore Park,
but before reaching the Captain Cook Hotel
it wanders off uncertainly to the left, and
corkscrews in and out of Dowling, Selwyn
and Iris streets to Green’s-road. Then it
takes in a narrow strip of “park” at the
back of Victoria Barracks-—which are in
Paddington—and zigzags easterly at the rear
of the Paddington Town Hall. Near Centen-
nial Park the boundary-line emerges at Lein-
ster-street, and runs along Gordon-street for
a few yards to the north boundary of Park-
road. But instead of turning directly down
Park or Lang road, which is the obvious
route, it darts across Gordon-street to Oxford-
street, through the grounds of St. Matthias’s
Church, and, neatly lassoing a block of
shops at the extreme corner of Oxford-street,
the boundary-line twists back again, and
runs down the western side of Centennial
Park in Lang-road. Just at this Oxford cor-
ner, opposite the Centennial Park gates, four
municipalities rub shoulders —Randwick,
Woollahra, Paddington and Sydney. Thus the
City of Sydney includes three or four shops
in Oxford-street, at the Centennial Park end,
and all the municipality of Paddington comes
between them and the next Oxford-street
shops of Sydney, which are in Flinders v\ ard
at Darlinghurst, a mile away. A dog’s hind-
leg is the accepted simile for crookedness,
but it describes a graceful curve compared
with the contorted boundary-line of Flinders
Ward. , , .
King-street, Sydney, is not included in anv
ward of the municipality. It is a strip m
No Man’s Land. Bourke Ward ends at the
northern building-line of King-street, and


Macquarie Ward ends at its southern build-
ing-line, leaving the roadway and footpaths
belonging to neither. More than that, this
ribbon of territory is produced in a straight
line which goes right through the old Dis-
trict Court buildings at the top of King-
street, and continues on through the Domain
to Sir John Young’s-crescent in Woolloomoo-
loo. If any citizen happens to reside on this
alien strip of the municipality—a caretaker
at the Industrial Court, for instance —he can-
not legally exercise the franchise, for he does
in any ward of the city of Sydney.
There used to be a picturesque annual
ceremony in some parts of England called
“Beating the Bounds.” The civic and muni-
cipal bigwigs, in high state, followed the
borders of their municipalities, and, wading
streams and steeplecliasing over obstacles,
traversed the actual marches of their dis-
tricts. It would be an impressive spectacle
to see my Lord Mayor of Sydney in the robes
and rabbit-skins of his office, and accompanied
by his five-and-tw-enty colleagues, attempting
to beat the impossible bounds of the city of
Sydney.
It all leads to uncertainty and untidiness
and waste.
NORMAN CAMPBELL.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Back-yard Industries.
“Blanc” : “Legislative action to pre\-ent the
practice of such employees as railwaymen,
miners, journeymen eoachbuilders and far-
riers taking on private work during their own
time was urged by a deputation to the Min-
ister for Labor and Industry,” the Sydney
Telegraph tells us. Also, “the Minister ex-
pressed sympathy and said amendments of the
Early Closing and Industrial Acts were con-
templated, and the matter Would be very care-
fully considered.” And he is Minister for
Industry! Also, he is one who, after his
day’s work a few years ago, did his utmost
to improve his speaking and organising abili-
ties in order to take the job of M.L.A. from
some fellow-man. He also wrote Labor
articles which might have been left to
struggling journalists who depend on their
articles for their bread and butter. J.W., a
moulder at Eimleigh, doing the same job day
after day for three years, was an ideally
thoughtful, steady and studious worker and
citizen—the kind of chap the W.E.A. likes
to get hold of. He could not remain inactive,
and disliked pubs, ponies and the Stadium,
lie had to be improving himself. Unable at
Eveleigh to develop the ideas that came into
his fertile brain, he became a “back-yard”
worker; and naturally, on account of the
expense incurred in experimenting, he made
articles of 1 marketable or home value. In
an ironmonger’s window he saw, let us call
it a gadget, marked 375. 6d, Going home he
made 42 of these gadgets from 16s. worth of
metkl. Taking them to a retailer he was
offered 10s. apiece for as many as he could
bring. And, unlike the Minister as a Par-
liamentary candidate, he wasn’t doing anyone
out of a job here in Australia, for the ori-
ginals were imported as well as inferior.
Other firms getting to hear of him, he decided
to draw his time at Eveleigh and open a fac-
tory at Sydenham. He now employs nine
hands, among whom he himself works. The
minimum wage is £9 a week, and liis “mates”
have a share as well. Hundreds of car-
owners wondered why the price of these
gadgets suddenly fell from 375. 6d. to 12s. 6d.
and at the same time improved in finish and
quality. J.W. has some of the things he
hoped for, is helping nine others to get the
same, and has created a local industry. Surely
preferable to being a moulder of the one
article day after day for life, and an uncer-
tain “wage-slave” at that! Car-buffers were
selling at £8 to £l2 when W.M., a mechanic
at Mort’s Dock, finding time heavy on his
hands, after his 48 hours, tried his
hand at making Australian buffers in liis
back yard. When the strike at the Dock
threw him out of work there, instead of asking
fellow-workers in other industries to keep him
and his family he said to his wife : “I’m going
round the motor firms with my buffers.” He
didn’t go x-ound, for the first firm gave him
an order for “up to 500 sets” at £2 10s. a
set, at which price he cleared £lB a week in
his back yard. It didn’t matter to him that
the firm sold them at £5 a set. His back yard
has developed into a new Balmain factory
paying five men union wages. Unionists who
object to “backryard industries” are playing
into the hands of foreign traders and those
who have a mortgage on our countryand
they are stifling the inventive genius which
exudes from the native-born Aussie,, aiid
which should be. encouraged to exude. Must
men like J.W. and W.M. take to reading,
racing or loafing on the streets to fill up
the 74. hours of their week after working for
.44 and sleeping for 50? Had George
Stephenson riot been a baek-yarder after
his 16-hours’ day how much poorer the Avorld
would have been to-day! Let us honestly
use every capability Ave possess in every
possible direction. There will then soon
spring up young factories owned and worked
by workers, giving a sympathetic deal
fellow-workers; and the national-debt incu-
bus will begin to get a little less terrifying
each year.
The Drab Years Ahead.
On a recent cold day, when nothing was
cheerful and the prospects of the wheat
market were specially forbidding, a cable-
gram of the Job’s messenger description
arrived from Canada. That big country anti-
cipates a wheat crop of some 440,000.000
bushels. It is 50.000,000 btxshels more than
Canada ever had before, and more than
txvice what the Dominion produced in 1918;
but since the wheat-farmers began to plant
the middle province of Saskatchewan pro-
gress has been continuous. And the worst
of the prospect is that it promises to con-
tinue to continuous. The anticipated crop
is 2| times larger than Australia’s record
output, that of 1915-16, and five times the
size of last output. There were seldom, if
ever, so many big crops expected at once,
Avhieh is partly due to luck and partly to the
feverish exploiting of lands like Saskatche-
wan during the war. On the other side
of the account is the fact that never since
the wheat-importing habit began (and it
can be traced beyond the time when the
Egyptian wheat-ships came to Italy to feed
old Rome) have so many impoverished
nations, gll habitual importers, simultane-
ously resolved to see if some local vegetable
won’t partly fill the bill. It looks, therefore,
as if Australia might be in for a new experi-
ence. In 1894 wheat dropped in Sydney to
2s. Bd. per bushel, but as the Ma State then
imported most of its bread from adjacent
States it got its cheap loaf at the expense
of other people, and said that the situation
was first rate. Now N. S. Wales is in most
years the greatest wheat-producer of all the
States, and has most at risk. Though Ma
is a spasmodic female, she was in front
during 1912, 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916 and
1921. So N. S. Wales has joined the ex-
porting class along with Victoria, South
Aus. and Westralia; but as it didn’t enter
the class till 1898 it has never experienced
the horrors of a foreign market with the
bottom out of it. It may do so this year,
along with Victoria, S.A. and Westralia,
and then the many borrowed millions which
have been spent by at least three of them
to make room for a million wheat farmers,
all crying for Government aid on a million
farms, will begin to wear a foolish aspect.
To make matters worse, there never was
much diversity in the agriculture of the four
grain States; and things have been getting
worse rather than better; in 1869 wheat in
Victoria covered only 41 per cent, of the
ploughed area so far as the ancient figures
show, whereas in 1921 it covered 81J per-
cent. In N. S. Wales wheat occupied 63
per cent, of the space devoted to husbandry
in 1869, and 79 per cent, in 3921. So if a
terrace of profitless years should come Aus-
tralia will be the hardest hit for two rea-
sons. One is that of the four countries
which supply Britain and some adjacent
parts with wheat (the United States, Canada
and Argentina being the other three) it
has the least left for itself after the long
freight bill is paid. The other is the lack
of alternative fuel to keep the financial pot
boiling. There is a local market for far
more than all the population could produce;
but instead of taking measures to supply it
we have depended upon the foreign manu-
facturer. In the past 12 months N. S.
Wales alone imported 55 millions’ worth of
goods, most of them the products of foreign
factories. We could absolutely keep the
Australian market for Australian goods ; we
could absolutely guarantee a market for the
output of Australian factories up to the
limit of our requirements. As wheat-expor-
ters, on the other hand, we can guarantee
nothing—except that among the large pro-
ducers for the world’s market we must pay
the heaviest ocean freights, while, owing in
part to the appalling waste of borrowed
money on unprofitable railways, our train
haulage is extraordinarily costly, the effect
of these two circumstances being that less
is left for the Australian than for any other
wheat farmer on a big scale. There is
no indication of either the Federal or State
authorities seriously facing the situation that
is developing for our agriculturists; but it
will have to be faced, and the sooner the
truth is told about it the less disastrous are
the consequences likely to be. In the de-
velopment of our “secondary” industries lies
our great hope; and before that can be done
as it should be done the Labor party will
have to be persuaded that many changes
must be made in our methods. For one
thing, we shall have to take work more seri-
ously than Ave have been doing the last few
years.
Singapore or Port Stephens?
As the case looks on present information :
The place for our main naval base is on coast
or islands handy to hostile bases. The Henderson
scheme was prepared at a time when our most pro-
bable naval antagonist was a European Power; but
those conditions have been entirely changed. As the
probable hostile fleet in Henderson’s time would
most likely have reached Australia via the Gape or
the Red Sea, striking the Commonwealth first on its
western coast, the Admiral placed one of his main
bases there; and as the European fleet’s main objec-
tive would probably have been our bloated coastal
capitals where most of our resources in men, docks,
cables, wireless, manufactures, fuel and railway
depots are, Henderson placed his main base at
Westernport. Now any Asiatic Power’s most likely
main objective would be the unsettled North —not
the capitals, which in these days could be effectively
dealt with by aeroplanes. But to protect the North,
where Asia would most likely land not so much
soldiers as settlers, our chief base must be in a
position to threaten the routes to Northern Australia,
which requirement puts Fremantle, Port Stephens
and Westernport out of the question. If the Com-
monwealth had a northern port connected by rail
with its southern resources, that harbor might be
suitable; but as the base is not for Australia only
but . for the British Fleet, which has ; to protect
India and the Empire’s, possessions on the Indian
Ocean (including. Westralia), then - the best, position
is one eovering the routes which the hostile navy
will have to use to reach these places. Here again
a northern location is most handy and central.
Also, with a northern base all Australia is covered,
and no matter where the enemy landed troops, even
if the convoying squadrons eluded ours, they could
be met coming- back, and the'army’s communications
would be at the victor’.s mercy; just as Nelson,
though the French fleet had landed its troops, by
destroying the ships in the Nile battle also de-
stroyed the army, which never saw France again.
Then there is always a certain percentage of a
large fleet in dock, and obviously the closer the
repairing place to the probable battle-ground the
better; and no ship could go to dock unescorted
if an enemy base had to be passed. Further, after
a battle the squadron which can first repair and
refit lias the advantage. Another valuable attribute
of a base) is its command of the routes of commer-
cial shipping, neutral or hostile. This is easiest
accomplished near narrow straits, and here again
the North, with its proximity to Macassar', Sunda
and Torres, has the advantage. For a.- battleship
base, too, supplies of oil fuel and heavy ammuni-
tion are essentia]; but as Australia produces neither,
the North has the advantage of being closer to
sources of supply.
When England was at war with France and Spain
her bases were Portsmouth, Plymouth and Falmouth,
the harbors closest to the hostile Channel ports, with
Gibraltar and Malta to command the enemy’s Medi-
terranean bases and straits. When Germany be-
came the foe, Rosyth and Scapa Flow, both almost
unknown, but close to hostile ports, and covering
the Atlantic, were chosen. Since the making of the
Panama Canal and the rise of Japan the United
States has made bases on the Californian coast' and
at Hawaii, again close to the probable enemy.
Japan’s new bases, too, are not at Saghalien, but
on islands reaching out towards America and Aus-
tralia. By analogy, the Commonwealth’s main base
must be on the . coast or islands near the .. most pro-
bable enemy ;this would be ' so " even''if The' coldnisa-
tion of the unsettled North was not the most pro-
bable bone of contention. To make bases at Fre-
mantle, Westernport and Port Stephens would be
as if in 1914 England’s bases had been at Fal-
mouth, Bristol and Queenstown. The German Fleet
would have had a glorious time if they had been.
Politicians, Thieves and Sundries.
The Bruce-Page-Pearce Government has
more of the courage of its bad intentions
than the HughesYsruce-Pearc,e Govern-
ment which went before it. However much
the previous crowd may have wanted, as a
matter of votes, to break its word of honor
in re the South-to-North railway, it hung
fire. Hughes, the man who never made up
his mind about anything save the creation
of billets, plodded along year after year
pleading that he wanted more and still more
information about the surveyed route. It
has been a well-trodden route ever since
South Aus. enterprise completed the tele-
graph line across it in 1872, and the little
townships on the way are known to the
census-taker and to hawkers and others; but
Hughes could never get enough information.
The new Government is more definite. It
has now moved for the extension of the Ter-
ritory narrow-gauge line another stage to
Daly Waters, and made some mention of the
possibility of putting in a scrap of “light
line” at the other end, the great transcon-
tinental railway, for the construction of
which along a specified route S. Australia
paid with a land grant of 200,000 acres per
mile, being treated more as a possible tram-
way than anything else. But it was care-
fully mentioned that the Ministry in no way
pledged itself to observe the contract: —
When the time arrived for the construction of a
through transcontinental line, negotiations could be
entered into with South Aus. which would permit
of the alteration of the Northern Territory Accept-
ance Act 1910 to allow of the line being constructed
on the route then shown to be in the best interests
of Australia.
The most obvious meaning of that is that
S.A, will be asked to consent to being
swindled, and if it doesn’t consent it will be
swindled just the same. The proper route
in “the best interests of Australia” will
doubtless be the one lined with the most
votes for the party in office. No one has
shown any better route than the one which
has been trodden for over 50 years. Minister
Pearce’s ' own department enthuses over the
country in its No. 7 Census Bulletin as no-
body has ever enthused over South-Western
Queensland. But quite a lot of grasping
local lxiterests are at work. Years ago some
Queensland politicians conceived the idea of
keeping S. Australia’s land-grant and steal-
ing the railway. Attorney-General Groom,
who put the idea of getting away from the
agreement into words the other day, comes
from Queensland. The plunder was to be
shared with N.S.W., as the stolen line would
join on to Sydney, and Ministers Page,
Chapman and Bowden belong to N. S.
Wales. South Australia would; of course,
bear its share of the expense of the deviation,
and, the proposed line being 300 miles longer
than the onp in the original agreement, the
expense would be considerable, Presently
there was tacked on a proposition that the
Commonwealth should do some railway-
building in Northern N.S.W. and South
Queensland also partly at the cost of S. Aus-
tralia. This was to finish the N.S.W. North
Coast railway, connect it with Brisbane, and
turn it into a main artery. The electorate
of Treasurer Page is in that northern corner
of N. S. Wales. After that a scheme was
uncoiled by which Westralia was to get, at
the general cost (including that of South
Aus.), a one-gauge railway to Sydney, which
would leave the South Aus. capital quite off
the transcontinental route. Minister Pearce
hails from Westralia. Queensland, of
course, was the original source of the great
intrigue. It is a poor contributor to the
common fund out of which railway losses
come, paying at latest advices 40s. 4d. per
head per annum in direct Federal taxps,
against S. Australia’s 765. Bd. and a general
average of 745. 9d. But its Premier has a
brow of brass, and his scheming is as good as
his finance is bad. And as all his devices
take N.S.W. into partnership his position
is remarkably good, especially against a
State which was carefully left out when the
portfolios were distributed. When the State
wfiich paid for the transcontinental line was
omitted from the list everybody in the know
made a shrewd guess that expediency had
beaten honesty in a canter.
•
Active Service —Real and Bogus.
During the debate on the Air Defence Bill
Attorney-General Groom came to the rescue
of his bemused colleague, Defence Minister
Bowden, with the following:—
We had trouble with the Defence Act which . we
passed in 1903. In that Act the definition of
“active service” was— ;
“‘Active service’ means service in or with.a; force
which is engaged in operations against the enemy,
and includes any naval or military service in time
of war.”
When war-time arrives it is desirable to apply
common definitions in all the Dominions in the
Empire. It was found to be so in' the, recent war.
For that reason we had to tiring down to this
House, in 1917, a bill to amend the Defence Act.
and we then made the definition of “active service”
read as follows: —
“ ‘Active service’ has a meaning corresponding to
that of the same words gs used in subsection (1)
of section one hundred and eighty-nine of the Army
Act defining the expression ‘on active service.’ ”
The effect of the Army Act definition is to
present as participators in the horrors and
hardships of what the ptfblic understands by
“active service” men who, in point of fact,
have no intention or prospect of hearing a
gun fired. During the late war places such
as Le Havre, Etaples, Rouen and Cairo
swarmed with these wary patriots. They
wore the same uniforms as the men in the
line. Some, though actually in less peril
than the inhabitants of London or Brighton,
carried revolvers and became expert in the.
adjustment of gas-masks. They filled in
printed forms indicating to anxious hearts
at home that they were still unwounded, and
franked their communications “O.A.S. (in
the Field).” They earned D.S.O.’s and
M.C.’s just like the fighting-men, and, like
the fighters, they went to Blighty on leave.
The only distinction between them and the
real soldiers (other, of course, than that they
got more leave and decorations) lay in the
fact that they never fought. Their service was
no more active than that of one of the girls in
an Australian Pay Department. There was
no better reason for -representing them -as
being on active service than there was for
telling any other sort of transparent lie.
It was done—it always has been, done—at
the instance of senior officers, and officers
of rank or influence, anxious to enjoy the
pleasures and perquisites, material and
moral, of a soldier’s life, without its perils.
Turning to the other side of the picture, the
influence of the swindle on the troops who
really were O.A.S. was rotten ; and the irri-
tation it engendered in them might have
led to serious developments if the war had
not ended when it did. Far from a “com-
mon definition” of active service being de-
sirable in war-time, it is as undesirable as
any imaginable piece of dishonesty can be.
The old Defence Act definition is the right
one ; and for the purposes of any future war
it ought to be extended to its full logical
limits. The fiction that uniformed persons,
living safely and luxuriously at bases and
remote army corps and army headquarters,
are “in the Field” should be scotched. And
certain decorations should be reserved for
service in the field. It is an outrageous fact
that nearly half of the D.S.O.’s bestowed in
the late war went to officers who saw no
fighting whatever.
. :—o-
The Brand Ineffaceable.
“R. G. N. Cliffwell” on another problem of
crime and punishment:—
No penal code intentionally provides for infliction
of a life sentence as punishment for a “slip” which
earns for the offender a couple of years’ gaol. Such
punishment is, however, very frequently inflicted.
This penalty is usually suffered for the crime of
being found out—found out in forgery, embezzle-
ment, misappropriation of trust moneys, juggling
with accounts ; usually the crimes of the more intelli-
gent or more cultured of wrongdoers. The sentenc-
ing judge in such cases would hold that, the sentence
having been served, the offence is expiated and the
offender, purged of his misdoing, is free to start with
a clean slate. But he isn’t. The r offender ■<, is ex-
tremely lucky, and needs to be of sound metal and
strong character, if he ever starts again on his old
level.
There is a weak - link in the penal system in regard
to this type of offender —the man who slips once and,
having expiated, is genuinely repentant and sincere
in his determination to sin no more. He has a heavy
handicap ;he is branded for life. Two courses lie
before him. In seeking rehabilitation and a new
job he may be frank with his new employer, telling
his story and taking the risk of being dismissed on
the spot for the ex-convict he is. On the other
hand he may suppress his story, taking the risk of
its subsequent discovery and his own contumelious
sacking. Either way he stands to be sacked. His
drift then becomes downward, to the kind of job
in which the employer is either not curious or not
finicky about the antecedents of the employed.
Not only is the ex-sinner affected. There arises
the duty of the outsider who knows the ex-sinner's
story. Should he tell ? His choice is difficult
equally with that of the sinner. Eager to give the
poor devil a chance, he remains silent about what
he knows —and the sinner sins again. The outsider,
in saving an unworthy man from injury, has inflicted
avoidable injury upon a worthy man. Eager to
protect the man he knows to be unwittingly employ-
ing one the outsider knows to have been unworthy,
the outsider tells—and drives back into the dirt a
repentant sinner truly striving to recover his lost
state. Evil either way !
The position of. the employer is as difficult. If,
knowing his employee to have erred, he retains him
in spite of his story, and the sinner sins agaih, the
Good Samaritan feels himself to be a fool who has
only received that for which he looked. All his
friends will think the same and most of them will
tell him what they feel. For his business reputation’s
sake an employer dare not take the risk. Most men
will not take such a chance, eager though they may
be to help an erring brother. They decide to play
safe, leaving the quixotism to the other fellow.
For the ex-convict the only hoph seems to be
that he seek rehabilitation in his home town,
where, being known, he may be accepted and helped
for old times’, his people’s and old acquaintance
sake. Character is demanded, however, in'the man
who can face this —“the shanie of going back.” I
know those who have done it. One of the biggest
corporations in Victoria is run by an ex-lawyer
who “did time” for misappropriation; two substan-
tial businesses are conducted successfully by men
recorded in police-books as misdemeanants in a serious
degree. All went back to their home towns and
“lived it down” pluckily. Scores, however, could
not do that; they would face any risk of rebuff and
harrying rather than return to their home town.
Especially does this apply to the young fellow who
has crashed through betting, cutting a dash and being
“one of the boys”—and he is the mis-stepper the
community should be most anxious to save.'
The indeterminate sentence,'a “lifer”—as any gaol
sentence is in effect in such cases —is so monstrous
a penalty for crime which in its beginning is usually
one of impulse committed to cover a minor lapse,
that a revision of penal procedure would be kind,
arid in keeping with' the less revengeful and more
reformative purpose which now underlies punishment
for social error. It is,'at least, as good a field for

There is something to be said'for the French sys-
tem of preliminary examination of , an accused by a
magistrate. A wise judge could by this means
ascertain whether public interest demanded that
names and details should be made public, or whether
the possible saying of a first offender would not be
better assured by a judicious suppression' of records
which might rebound cruelly upon the offender when,
his offence purged, he sought to resume his original
well-conducted life. No rule could be made. Every
case would have to be decided on its merits. There
would, doubtless, be mistakes: “bad eggs” would
be given a chance they did not deserve, inno-
cent people would be victimised, young fools would
mistake leniency for luck and slip again. They,
however, could be punched the harder at the second
lapse. The community would probably be the gainer
in the long run —perhaps if only one - backslider were
saved who otherwise would be forced among the
down-and-outs by the unintentional over-severity of
the present system.
“M.O’L.” : The argument in favor of Elec-

an Australian M.P. of 20 years’ standing
and Cabinet rank stands upon two legs.
One of them is, I am sorry to say, wOoden;
the other is badly affected with syqovitis.
Leg One is that the Irish Free Con-
stitution was drafted by British Ministers;
Leg Two, that they therein laid doiyn the
principle of Elective Ministries. The first
draft of the Constitution was drawn jby a
committee of constitutional experts in j Dub-
lin under the direction of the Provisional
'Government.. It was met in London with an
absolute non possumus. A few days later
Mr. Arthur Griffith bobbed up again with
the draft so modified as to comply with the


MARMITE--the most appetising 'tween-meal DRINK!
This pure vegetable extract makes the most
delightful ’tween-meal drin> Mix it with a little
hot water in a few seconds. No trouble to make,
and so appetising that you v v iH l°°k forward in
anticipation to next meal-time. Has none of the
“heaviness” of meat extracts, an'd is much more
valuable, because it has none of tbe dietetic dis-
advantages of meat.
Try Marmite in this way as an experiment. You
will soon come to realise that it is a.n essential in
every kitchen. It adds to soups, stews, sauces,
croquettes, rissoles and other little dishes a flavor
so piquant and enticing that your success as a chef
will become unassailable.
And there is a deeper reason why you should use
Marmite! It increases the nourishment you get
from your food and makes such foods more readily
digestible. Try it to-morrow. Obtainable from

requirements of the British negotiators.
That is the full tale of the part played by
British Ministers in the, drafting of the Free
State Constitution. Article 51 provides for
the erection of an Executive Council —the
analogue of our Cabinet —which shall be re-
sponsible to Dail Eireann (the Chamber of
Deputies or Lower House), and shall consist
of not more than seven nor less than five
Ministers. They shall be “appointed by the
representative of the Crown on the nomina-
tion of the President of the Executive Coun-
cil,” and they must all be members of the
Dail. The President of the Executive Coun-
cil, or Prime Minister, is to be nominated
by the Dail, which in practice will mean by
the majority party therein; and “the other
Ministers who are to hold office as members
of the Executive Council shall be appointed
on the nomination of the President, with the
approval of the Dail [that is, with the assent
of the party that elected him Pre-
sident]', and he and the Ministers
nominated by him shall retire from office
should he cease to retain the support of a
majority in Dail Eireann.” Article 54 pro-
vides for the collective responsibility of the
Council for the administrative acts of each
of its members. Provision is made in Article
55 (and here we come to the elective prin-
ciple) that additional Ministers, who shall
not be members of the Executive Council,
may be appointed by the Dail. But the
whole Ministry, including the Executive
Council, shall not exceed 12. The extra-
Executive Ministers are appointed for the
life of the Dail which elects them, and
may be removed from office only by the Dail
itself, for stated reasons, after a report by
an impartial committee. All this seems to
be far away from the ideal Elective Ministry.
The following tables are compiled to show
how much loan money was required (11 to
reduce the agricultural population of N. S.
Wales and (2) to reduce the cultivated area
of Ma State: —

Increase . . . . £45,560,369
These figures represent no spasmodic move-
ment. They simply show how a time came
when agriculture began to die from a num-
ber of causes, which include: (1) Insanely
long distances from a market. Every new
patch of outlying settlement beguiled neople
further from Sydney, and no one gives them
facilities for using a nearer port. Distances
are always lengthening, never diminishing.
(2) Increased charges per mile for an in-
creased number of miles. Every year three
■or four hew lines are opened which aren’t
.even expected to pay, and the losses on these
have to be paid by somebody. (3) Enormous
increase, not only in Federal war taxes,
which can hardly be helped, but in State
peace taxation. This went up from 15s. 9d.
per head per annum in 1913 (the minimum
for recent years) to 70s. 9d. in 1921 (the
maximum). The most visible cause is that
a gang of robbers in politics have no know-
j et %e of anything except loan-mongering,
and if they didn’t float loans they would get
the sA c k for intellectual bankruptcy.

die from natural causes, and are not found

with Ireland’s troubles, British statesmen might con-
sider the potato. This vegetable pestilence was
taken to Ireland by Admiral Hawkins as a little
side-line when that tough old sea-dog was not too
busy promoting the African slave-trade. Erin took the
tuber to her bosom, and it appears to have served
its hostess as did the fox hidden in the Spartan
boy’s jersey. Every medico out of Ireland places
the murphy on the dyspeptic’s index expwrgatorius.
The root is 75 p.c. water, 3 p.c. sugar,
18 p.c. starch and a few etceteras. The
human liver converts the sugar and starch into
a form of glucose, and the kidneys, when
disgruntled by a too-generous starch-and-sugar diet,
kick back at the liver by starting a uric-acid fac-
tory. The result is rheumatism. Muscular uric acid
is the Devil, but cerebral uric acid is Beelzebub
with De Valera thrown in. Ireland has more mus-
cular rheumatism than any other country in the
world, and at present appears to have the other kind
acutely. Therefore the potato is before the court on
circumstantial evidence, at any rate. The High-
lands of Scotland are peopled by a race close kin to
the Irishman. The Highlander from time im-
memorial, when he made long trips to see that other
clansmen’s unbranded cattle were all right, lodged
in the bracken on the mountain side, first dipping his
plaid in a burn and wrapping the wet sheet round
his body; yet his descendants swear on the sacred
bottle that rheumatism was negligible—even un-
known—in the Highlands till the potato was brought
over from Ireland. Scotland, which never took
kindly to the tuber, has had the landlord disease
worse than its neighbor, yet never made a hobby of
gunning landowners unnecessarily or for sport. The
evictions among the crofters were more wholesale
and terrible than among the bog-trotters, still the
ONE DIDN’T LET AUSTRALIA DOWN—WILL THE OTHER?
THE DIGGER: “I hopped in when you asked me to. Now, it’s up to you to do YOUR
little bit.”
crofters never took freely to arguing politics with a
sling shot or “fighting like devils for civilisation
and hating each other for the love of God.” On the
other side take an Irishman in Ireland, with his
potato and his uric acid. He peeved about landlords
till the British Government robbed him of that
grievance at a cost of over a hundred millions, and
left him in the desolate position of being his own
landlord. Then he took to De Valera for relief
from his over-burdened kidneys. Exile the Irishman
from Erin and his potato, and he becomes, after a
few years of a different diet, a changed man —a
Kingston, a Dalley, a Hercules Robinson ; ceases
to talk economics with a half-brick or piece of lead
pipe, and can be trusted with a gun behind a hedge
where landlords are as thick as rabbits, no matter
how alluring the night. There does appear to be
some evidence to at least commit the spud for trial
as a pernicious vegetable related in the Linn;ean
classification to the deadly nightshade.
“Ex-Dig.” : The position of blind soldiers in
respect to the Repatriation provision for
the education of deceased soldiers’ children
has been a matter of controversy between
the Returned Soldiers’ League and the Re-
patriation Commission for the last couple of
years. The education scheme was designed
for the children not only of soldiers who
were killed in action or have died from war
injuries, but also of totally and permanently
incapacitated men. The Commission, how-
ever, maintains that blind soldiers do not
come under the T. and P. I. head. It seems
a mean sort of excuse; but there is this to
be said for the Commission, that the funds
allotted for this scheme are limited, and
there are more than enough applicants to
absorb them as it is. The blind soldiers
have full pension, with allowances for wife
and children on the T. and P.I. scale : and in
nearly every case decently-paid occupation
has been found for them. Moreover they
receive many minor concessions; and
although it would be idle to suggest that
anything can compensate them for what
they have lost, a number are shareholders
in such publicly-supported ventures as the
Blinded Soldiers’ Tea Co., and none can be
in real want. But the Commission’s treat-
ment of men who are unable to work, but
whom the doctors decline to declare T. and
P. 1., is absolutely cruel. These men re-
ceive only £2 per week pension, plus allow-
ances for wife and children, and have to
struggle along on that. They go backwards
and forwards for review, and may continue
going so for years. They are mainly T.B.
and bad shell-shock cases; and it is doubt-
ful whether even a blind man deserves more
sympathy or undergoes more suffering than
one who is badly neurasthenic, especially
when he has an incessant financial struggle.

“Hanno” : I wish that some of our languid
Medical Boards would tell me why it is
that no restrictions are placed upon the
registration as medical practitioners of the
holders of diplomas from foreign Universi-
ties and medical schools. It strikes me as
a one-sided arrangement. A graduate of any
recognised institution in a foreign country
can come to Australia and start imme-
diately in competition with qualified
Australians in a very overcrowded profes-
sion. The newcomer has merely to apply for
registration to the Medical Board of the
State in which he intends to live, and, if
there are no defects in his diploma—or,
rather, if the Board is not aware of any—•
registration is granted automatically. Yet in
most of the countries to which we extend this
courtesy the medical profession is still held
as a preserve in which local graduates have
the first opportunities, and the if
he desires to enter, must either go through
the local medical course, irrespective of his
qualifications, or elso sit for a special exami-
nation. Even in the United States, or most
of them, an Australian medical graduate will
find he has to do a lot more than present his
credentials to obtain registration. Men and
women who spend six years in obtaining an
Australian degree should certainly be pro-
tected from the fcee competition of others
who have probably had less than half that
training. There is reciprocity between the
Commonwealth and other parts, of the Brit-
ish Empire; yet lately some applicants from
Sydney and Melbourne Medical Schools have
had difficulty in getting registered in Eng-
land, and another was refused altogether in
South Africa.

“D.E.”: When stuck for a subject to irradi-
ate the rag I used to run I have written
many a fill-up article about the blunders of
English geographers regarding Australia.
But the local publication from which my
small daughter absorbs facts, etc., about her
native Commonwealth is a saddening proof
that the British compiler doesn’t monopolise
the misinformation. Published at Sydney
and bearing the date 1923, this manual
asserts, among other things, that “the Mount
Morgan mine (Q.) yields gold to the value
of a million sterling annually.” How the
Mount Morganaire must wish it did! Port
Augusta (S.A.) is referred to as a place
“whence a railway to Kalgoorlie is under
construction.” The railway has been in
operation since 1917. Kalgoorlie and West-
ralia are described in these remarkable sen-
tences :
Kalgoorlie, once the mining metropolis of the
West. It w,as formerly the business centre of the
East Coolgardie goldfield, and the adjoining district
is still the scene of some mining operations.
Westralia once possessed, in the Golden Mile, at
Kalgoorlie, one of the richest gold-producing tracts
in the w0r1d.... It now yields copper, coal, tin and
silver, while wheat and maize are the chief crops.
Well, Kalgoorlie isn’t booming so mightily
as it did when Callahan was tearing
30,000 ounces a month out of the Lake View,
but it is still very decidedly “the mining-
metropolis of the West.” The census-taker
found 23,495 persons in the district two years
ago, and I doubt if he would have to revise
his figures downward if he had to do the job
again. Also, to write of the Golden Mile in
the past tense is simply grotesque. Its glory
has paled a bit in the process of 30 winters*
but it still produces nearly four-fifths of the
Vvestralian gold output and about half that
of the whole Commonwealth. Its daily yield
of gold in 1921 was worth more than the
combined yield for the year of tin, silver
(not extracted at Kalgoorlie) and copper,
yet these are alleged by the geographer to be
among the State’s principal products. As
for the assertion that maize is a leading
crop, the value of the maize grown in West-
ralia during the last three years was £207
in 1922, £lOB in 1921 and £49 in 1920. In
that year a whole 11 acres were under crop.
In justice to the (wisely) anonymous author
let it be stated that there is some really
capital matter in his book, along with this
insufferable rot. But I have given up rail-
ing at English geographers.

Randolph Bedford writes: —-
Just as Pilate and Herod could be friends, and
as the parson and the bookmaker in Victoria continue
to keep the totalisator off the Southern State’s race-
courses, so the New York City police fought the
State Prohibition law repeal to a finish. They failed,
and the Mullane Gage law goes into the W.P.B.
Liquor sellers in New York paid three grafts—one
to the Federal Prohibition offkers, one to the State
Prohibition officers, and one to the City Police.
With State Prohibition repealed two grafts would
go, and the State officers and the police fought
desperately to retain them. The cultivation of cor-
ruption is one more thing to put to the charge of
this foolish Prohibition. Wisconsin has repealed its
State law because it almost ruined the farmers who
raised barley; but California is safe. Before Pro-
hibition grapes were worth 25 dollars a ton ;. now,
with every family entitled to make 200 gallons of
wine a year, they are worth 400 dollars. So every
vigneron votes for Purity and Prohibition. The
cultivation of hypocrisy can thus be added to Prohi-
bition’s account, too.
“0.K.” : There is pathos of a, sort in Old
Militarism’s desperate endeavor to put off
the day when its pomp and flummery will
be laughed out of existence, and cocked hats
with feathers in them and crimson and gold
uniforms will be as obsolete as steel visors
and coats of mail. Militarism in Britain
persists in putting footguards into those pre-
posterous hats that have a framework inside
to prevent them from falling down and hiding
the wearer’s face. And lifeguards continue
to be called “potted meat” on account of the
steel breast-plate and back-plate, and the
tall, glittering helmet to match. These fol-
lies are abandoned by guards on active ser-
vice, but when war is temporarily suspended
the War Department’s expenditure on empty
show is resumed with renewed force. Wai
is a vile thing, and the more its vileness is
advertised the better. Instead, therefore,
of parading its pomp (which doesn’t exist)
we ought to parade its horrors; and the
League of Nations might do a real service
by moving in that direction.
“J.A.W.” on the Kidman blight:—
I can speak for Western N.S.W., having charge
of a large station adjoining what is known as “Kid-
man’s Territory.” On the Paroo River, Wanaaring
district, Kidman has four large stations, viz.,
Urisino, Elsinora, Wanaaring and Tinapagee.
These stations before coming into his possession
were well-improved properties ; they had a manager
and staff on each station, and carried large flocks
of sheep. Under Kidman’s methods, improvements
have been abandoned, staffs reduced to a minimum,
and sheep replaced by cattle, which means less
employment—at the present time one manager and
book-keeper and about a dozen men (mostly blacks)
are all these four large stations employ. Mr.
Norman Ford may approve these methods, the exist-
ence of which he denies ; but people in the West who
wish well for Australia’s future would be glad to see
the last of them.

POLITICAL
POINTS
On the latest King Bruce: —
Bruce has his followers more completely controlled
than Hughes ever had. During the discussion of the
Air Force Bill, which has since been withdrawn to
be remodelled, the complacent silence of Nationalists
and Farmers, on points which many must have felt
deeply, suggested a docility unprecedented in recent
Parliaments. So far as my memory serves me, only
Maxwell became vocal, but after one or two interjec-
tions his opposition weakened so much as to argue
that there had been a little head-to-head talk in the
party-room. Bruce commands his men with astute
generalship. His tact and nous when one or two
show a tendency to kick over the traces are conceded
even by bitter opponents. The other day, for in-
stance, there were prospects of an inter-party row.
The Farmers were accused of flooding their press
with propaganda regarding their influence in the
House. Two or three Nationalists took this as an
inferential depreciation of an ally, and bruited their
complaint in caucus. Here, if anywhere, were all
the materials for an explosion. But a few words
from Bruce cooled the atmosphere, and soon the
objectors were ready to kiss the Cookies and be
friends.
Bruce’s estimate of customs and excise
revenue for 1922-23 was £28,000,000. A year
ago, being then Hughes’s Treasurer, he de-
clared that “the present volume of imports
cannot continue.” In point of fact, imports
soared from £103,000,000 to £131,900,000;
and the customs and excise receipts exceeded
his forecast by £4.872,000 and last year’s
figures by £5,241,000. All this is melancholy
evidence that the tariff, as revised in j. 921,
is ineffective. And one cause of its ineffec-
tiveness is the loan mania, which enables
artificially affluent Governments and indi-
viduals to gratify their hunger for foreign
manufactured goods.
The other day a scrap of land in rather
second-rate Castlereagh-street fetched £1575
per foot. If N.S.W., which is thrice the
area of Maoriland, also had four cities of
about equal size (though it should have
more), possibly £350 per foot would have
sufficed in such a locality, and land prices
in general would be lower to correspond.
Then with so much less to pay in interest
on the money locked up, and less taxes,
the owner might perhaps pay better wages
or sell more cheaply. And if residential land
was one-fiftli what it is, owing to the popu-
lation being so much more dispersed, a young
couple would be able to build a better house
because they wouldn’t pawn themselves for
life to purchase a preliminary bit of
dirt; and they might have better fur-
nishings ; and they might be able to marry
earlier; and they might have the house to
themselves instead of sharing it with two
other families, in which case there would
be room for more babies and also a chance of
more civilised babies. The news that an-
other handicap of a hundred or two has
been put on the business of making a decent
start in life is good for land-jobbers, but
for no one else.
The Federal Government’s scheme of
income-tax is still misty in spite of the
Treasurer’s Budget Speech. The talked-of
arrangements between Commonwealth and
States are, generally, held up for a year.
But in N. S. AVales and Victoria one
authority will do all the collecting, except in
the case of incomes derived from more than
one State —a central office will take them in
hand. For its own part the Commonwealth
proposes to levy a flat rate of Is. in the £
on cos.’ dividends instead of 2s. sd. on un-
distributed profits. “Where, however, the
normal income-tax imposed upon an indi-
vidual [shareholder] is in excess of Is., he
will be charged income-tax upon those divi-
dends as at present, subject to a rebate of Is.
in the £.” But suppose his normal rate is
less than Is., w r hat then? Will the rich
snareholder get a larger rebate than the poor
shareholder? if the poor shareholder whose
“normal income-tax” is, say, Bd. gets only
the Bd. rebated, it will mean that on a por-
tion of his income—that derived from divi-
dends—he will be actually paying a 50 p.c.
surcharge for having put his little bit into a
co.- —probably a co. started to give Australian
industry a lift.
If the Commonwealth and the States keep
their compact, there will be no more new-
tax-free loans after this year; but there will
still be £350,000,000 of tax-free loans cur-
rent. The new policy is thoroughly good;
and now something will have to be done to
rope in from the tax-bearing loans the full
amount of the income-tax that ought to be
paid. Debentures pass from hand to hand,
and it is notorious that many holders do not
return their full holdings to the Tax Com-
missioners. How the evasion can be met
is none too clear; but the law _ might do
something substantial if it required every
sharebroker and other intermediary to be

From Svdney Repat. 10 men were dis-
charged as unwanted on June 80; all of
them are married, while single men, re-
cently taken on, were retained on the staff.
One of those dispensed with had been five
years in the department, having helped to
get it going; another is a one-armed ex-
Digger, who had learnt to write with his
left hand. By sacking married men the
authorities are able to teave the “living
allowances” granted under the Federal Gov-
ernment regulations for wives and children;
but they are setting up a rotten precedent.
No sooner did Premier Lawson show his
nose in Vic. than the Assembly, which had
been loquaciously doing nothing since July
11, promptly agreed to the Address-in-reply,
put through the sessional orders and pre-
liminary stages of bills, and said in so many
words, “Now bring on your business —if you
are ready.” As it happened, the Govern-
ment w-asn’t ready. But, fortunately for it,
the hurry-up notion didn’t seize the House
till it was time for the week-end adjournment.
The Bruce-Page Government doesn’t pro-
pose to do to alter the present
stupid and cumbersome system by which
land-tax is paid by individual shareholders of
a co. and not by the co. itself. The system
means such a terrific amount of book-keeping
and analysing and calculation that an ex-
travagant proportion of the two millions or
so collected must go in expenses. And the
basis is wrong: a man who owns one-
thousandth part of the shares in the Bank of
N. S. Wales doesn’t own one-thousandth part
of the bank’s land; if the bank asked Dr.
Earle Page to give professional advice to one
of its clerks, Dr. Earle Page would send the
bill to the bank, and not attempt to collect a
ha’penny from this shareholder and tuppence
from that one.
In spite of all temptations (one was the
“organisation” of agriculture at the fatherly
Government’s cost) the Queensland farmers
returned 13 Agrarian members at the late
election, and Theodore had counted on un-
seating six at least. Therefore are rural
workers to be empowered to approach the
State Arbitration Court for a basic £4 for
a 44-liour week. The subject was never
mentioned when electioneering Ministers
were courting the cockies; nor did anyone
contradict Moore, the new G.P. leader, when
he said in Parliament that only 17 farmers
per thousand earned enough to pay income-
tax in 1922, the average since the war being
a little over 30 per thousand. Labor is only
concerned with the fact that Cocky voted the
wrong ticket, and when Labor is on top the
loser pays. That is what losers are for.
One thing at least the history of Mel-
bourne’s Gas Co. should teach Parliaments
—never to allow the issue of new shares in
a public utility at a premium. If that was
prohibited there would be far less induce-
ment to the early shareholders to sock pro-
fits away in works—in other words, to charge
the public more than enough to pay a fair
dividend. While socking away is allowed the
capital value of the undertaking grows far
beyond the face value of the shares, and then
naturally any new capital got. in from out-
siders must be issued at a premiunr—if it
wasn’t, the new shareholders would get their
interest in the socked-away profits for
nothing. And being issued at a premium the
dividend must be nominally 10 p.c. in order
to give the new shareholders a return of 7
p.c. or in some cases even 5 p.c. So there
is always a pressure on the part of the new
shareholders to push up the dividend, and
fleece the public in the process.

Australia simply must wrestle with its
handling and haulage costs —they, more than
actual production costs, are cooking our
goose. With every issue comes an instance
of it. This week it is the Macclesfield (S.A.)
marble quarries that have shut down be-
cause, though the quality is Al, it costs
less to bring stone to Adelaide from Italy
than from the hills 30 miles away.
“Clinton”: Yes, the bad employer is
greatly to blame for the shortage of appten-
tices. I have a brother bound to the
engineering trade. He is a big lump of a
lad, and in the earlier days of his articles
complained that because he was strong and
hefty he was kept at plain laborer’s work.
We had to use all our influence to prevent
him breaking his indenture and taking a 1
laborer’s job. “I’m doing the work,” he said„
“and I might as well have the pay.” 1
hate to suggest further State inspection;
but there seems room for something of the
sort here.
Last week two things that kicked one
another happened in connection with the
German tangle—Britain, France and Bel-
gium got closer together than ever they had
been since the Ruhr occupation began ; but
instead of the German paper mark hardening,
it slithered down until it was 2,000,000 to the
£ —pre-war it was 20. It looks like a
swindle. When the four Powers get together
the mark will be stabilised by law ; that is
to say, the exchange will be fixed at so many
marks to the £. The speculator’s idea is to
send the mark whirling down far below the
point at which he hopes it will be stabilised:
there would be a fine profit in acquiring
marks on a two-million basis and having them
stabilised at, say, a million. But it is a
risky gamble. With the mark tumbling, the
man who hires himself out at a fixed rate
for even a day is liable to find that his wages
in the evening will buy only half-a-pound of
sausage whereas in the morning it wduld
have bought a pound ; and that’s the sort of
disappointment to produce anarchy.
Touching a non-party alliance: —
In the Keps. last week we had the unusual experi-
ence of hearing- the S. Aus. members, Nationalist
and Labor, in one united roar against the makeshift
N.T. railway. The fury of Foster, suppressed during
his term of office, burst forth in full flood, and for
once was approved by Yates and Gabb. Makin, the-
serious young student who unseated Archibald ini
1919, added his heavy baritone to the choir of dis-
approval, and the unanimity of the S. Australians;
set many sniggering cynically over the alleged decay
of the State spirit in Federal affairs; When Frank
Brennan mischievously spoke in support of the Gov-
ernment, he was assailed with interjections from,
brother Gabb amid an uproar that diverted everyone
except the interjector. Brennan stood it good-
humcredlv for a while, then he turned round and told
Gabb to “get back to the bulrushes.” Gabb subsided
in a cyclone of laughter. He happens to have the
middle name of Moses.
Last year Germany built 685 ships total-
ling 742,000 tons gross. The Hun ships are
on every sea again—mostly new ships, for
the old crocks were lost in the war. They
do business in every port worth calling at,,
but they don’t carry the hard cash profits:
back to pay any old indemnity with. The
money is invested in good business abroad,
and Switzerland, Spain, Scandinavia,
Russia, Turkey and Spanish America are
all being bought up. The second richest land
on earth might be searched from end to end,
and very little found save paper. The
biggest Hun bank is said to own nothing in
Hunland save its offices, office furniture,
account books and piles of notes like cathe-
drals. If the Allies gave notice that, pro-
vided no money turned up, city-wrecking
would begin after a certain date, Berlin be-
ing the first wreck, things might happen. But
the Allies are squeamish about Hun methods:
PAGE’S PILLS FOR LOAN-DRUNK PEOPLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“In his Budget speech, Dr. Page, the Common-
wealth Treasurer, announced a surplus of £1,020,150.
There was a massive increase in Customs receipts,
imports exceeding exports by £14,128,000. Borrow-
ing continues with little abatement.’’
Item, a surplus, more or less fictitious —
The kind on which our figure-jugglers thrive.
To sugar grown in Java and Mauritius
Adieu —at least till nineteen-twenty five.
The trade in frozen cow has gone to pieces ;
The income-tax receipts contrive to flop ;
But revenue from Customs still increases ;
It never does, but always is to, drop.
The tariff, called “protective,” notwithstanding,
This singular position you will find,
That imports are continually expanding,
While exports -have persistently declined.
More fluff we buy, more metal goods, more motors,
A lot less wheat and butter go away ;
Beyond all else we must placate our voters,
So loans increase and industries decay.
Another twenty millions we are borrowing ;
The States, no doubt, will cadge as much again.
Let other generations do the sorrowing;
For us the pleasure, if they have the pain.
A thousand millions soon we shall be owing.
Posterity will pay it, thank the Fates,
And that it may not vex you, we are going
To knock a ha’p’ny off the postage rates.

Regularly at each annual balance the direc-
tors take £lO,OOO to write down the book
value of premises, and profits in the table
are shown less that lay-by. Besides develop-
ing internal reserves, the directors are also
setting aside large amounts of profit in
visible reserves. lienee, though the surplus
available for divs., after reducing premises
account, represented almost 10.9 p.c. on capi-
tal, shareholders are receiving only 7 p.c.,
a poor rate of div. compared with the aver-
age of other Australian banks. But though
a trifle more could be safely distributed, the
directors are wisely making sure of the
future. Reserves in relation to capital are
still slender, but only 13 years have passed
since the business was dug out of the wreck
left by the storm of the ’nineties. Prior to
1910 it was the Australian Joint Stock
Bank, and it had been busy foy many years
meeting its obligations under the arrange-
ment made with creditors. It was a painful
undertaking, but recently-dead A. P. Stewart,
as general manager, gradually righted the
derelict and got shareholders and creditors
to agree to a final overhaul before setting
sail under a new name. Under A. P. Stew-
art’s far-sighted direction, the A.B.G. soon
began to respond to the favorable financial
breeze, and when he went to his long rest
just as his old bank was closing its latest
financial year it held £6 of deposits for
every £1 it had in 1910. The purchase
of the old City Bank of Sydney in 1917
added about 2J millions of deposits, and
that connection has also helped to expand
the business during the past half-dozen years.
This shows how, rapidly the A.B.C. has
grown since it issued its first accounts: —

In the 13 years paid capital has gone from
£958,172 to £1,200,000, and meanwhile
£370,265 of visible reserves have accumu-
lated. That lay-by is, of course, helping
earnings, and as the business grows bigger
something better than 7 p.c. divs. can be
expected. The trouble so far has been that
the volume of business handled has been
small in relation to the bank’s own funds.
This table shows some of the improvements
in that respect since 1915: —

1923.. 1,200,000 9,172,613 7.6 130,678 10.9
Even now less than £4 of the public’s money
is held for every £1 of the bank’s own funds,
which is only half what is regarded as a
safe working basis for an Australian bank.
In that calculation the £1,287,625 of in-
scribed deposits are treated as por-
tion of the barnk’s own funds. They
represent 10s. in the £ of old debt
which was funded, and carry 4 p.c. p.a. The
management is obliged to use £30,000 each
year to redeem the stock, and at the current
market price (145.) that amount would re-
purchase £42,857’ of the paper. At the pre-
sent rate of cancellation the inscribed de-
posits will not-disappear ,'for SO years;
meantime the stock is rfeally cheap pref. ! capi-
tal for the bank.
The management is having no difficulty in
finding profitable employment for all the
new money left in its care. At June 30
just 40 p.c. of all current liabilities was held
liquid, and the whole of the balance, to-
gether with all old deposits and the bank’s
own funds (except £453,421 in premises)
was loaned to customers. On paper, the
A.B.C.’s position looks very solid: the
£6,741,143 of current liabilities not covered
by liquid assets had the backing of advances
and premises w*ith a book value of
£9,641,034.

When the City of Melbourne, English and
Australian, Federal of Australia and Mer-
cantile banks crashed, the wreckage was
passed over to asset-realisation cos., and
they were later taken over by this Melbourne
Trust Co. Salvage operations subsequently
proved so successful that most of the wreck-
age has been re-sold at good profits, and
nowadays the Penang Sugar Co., station
properties in Queensland and a little vacant
land are practically all that is left of the
assets with which the co. started. Payment
of divs. began in 1906, and the Common-
wealth had made such a splendid recovery
from the troubles of the ’nineties and the
disastrous drought early this century that
handsome surpluses began to show up. By
1909 the £392,485 of debentures with which
the co. began had been redeemed, and a little
later shareholders were presented with
£246,559 of bonus debentures carrying 4 p.c.
p.a. All except £37,508 of that lot has since
been re-paid, and as 8 p.c. divs. have been
provided regularly for some years original
shareholders have had a great feast. This
shows the changes which have taken place
in balance-sheets in 16 years:—

1922.. 209,215 312,237 30,913 17,744
The book value of old assets was affected by
a writing-up in 1910. The feature of the
latest accounts was that new investments
exceeded paid capital. There were public
securities for £91,430; industrial and other
interests totalling £127,570; loans, £58,237;
deposits and cash, £39,028 —a total of
£316,265. Qn the other side, including de-
bentures (£37,508) and £3134 of notes of
the three old banks still outstanding, liabili-
ties totted up £118,629. Extracting the
year’s divs., the Trust showed £221,563 of
its capital of £300,000 represented by the
surplus of new investments, purchasers’
balances and cash over and above all exter-
nal liabilities. That left old assets with a
book value of £209,215 to cover approxi-
mately £78,500 of capital not represented by
other belongings. The string of healthy new
investments makes the Trust’s position very
snug.
Future possibilities depend a lot on market
offerings for the balance of old assets, and
earnings of plantations and squattages. Some
sources of profit—the purchasing of deben-
tures at a discount, for instance —have dried
up, and last year there was a small loss on
sale of old belongings. This comparison
throws further light on the matter: —

Counteracting that £1330 loss was a profit
of £7221 from marketing new investments.
Net.earnings apart from the £5891 balance
of profit on sales amounted to £38.007, and
expenses took £21,467, leaving a margin of
£16.540. Expenses, apparently, included
£3300 which the co. pays in income-tax on
behalf of shareholders: their 8 p.c., less
taxes, is shown to have taken £20,700. In-
cidentally, the rate of tax declined from
3s. sd. to 2s. 9d. in the £ last year, and
that leaves shareholders £BOO more. De-
ducting £404 paid into a staff fund, the net
results of operations last year was a profit
of £25,731. Earnings were smaller than for
any of the previous five years: owing to
labor troubles and low prices, the sugar co.
only made expenses and a bit over for de-
preciation, and conditions were not so favor-
able on the Queensland station properties,
though wool fetched better prices. Taxa-
tion is a bugbear; British, Commonwealth
and State assessments took £9BOl in the
last 12 months.

Profits for the year include £9OOO net
addition to an “insurance and repairs sus-
pense account, etc.,” which now totals
£138,714. Between 1911-18 an average of
£3400 p.a. was dropped into this reserve,
but lately it has been added to in this way:
1919, £22,115 ; 1920, £10,962 ; 1921, £15,60J ;
1922 (6 months), £3613; 1923, £9OOO. Most,
if not all, the £138,714 can probably be
treated as an accumulation of genuine: profit,
because some and probably all the contin-
gencies for which the fund was established
are otherwise provided for. There have
been no visible withdrawals from the
reserve. Repairs and renewals appear to
have been fully met out of current revenue;
and shipping risks are apparently covered in
the usual way outside —the loss of the Wol-
longbar and Our Jack in 1921 did not en-
croach on the “insurance” reserve. Includ-
ing the £9OOO put into this reserve, last
year’s profits returned 13 p.c. on capital, and
the usual 10 p.c. was paid to shareholders.
In face of the drought and general slackness
of trade—a number of steamers have been
out of commission—disclosed earnings were
surprisingly good. However, there may be
a big difference between what the co. says
it makes and the actual earnings: no revenue
or Profit and Loss account is published,
and the results for any year depend on inter-
nal adjustments for depreciation and various
contingencies. Possibly not so much was
set aside in those stockings last year; on
the other hand, earnings disclosed may have
been helped by surpluses realised over book
values of three small vessels sold during the
period. These are mysteries unfathomable
by the outsider.
Another view of North Coast perform-
ances can be got in the following balance-
sheet comparisons:—

In 10 years liquid assets have expanded
£87,392, and the book value of fixed assets
£103,603. Meanwhile, £94,714 of new capi-
tal has been issued, but outside liabilities
have shrunk £5267. The value of net assets
has expanded £101,548 apart from exten-
sions provided out of new capital. Put an-
other way, besides paying an average of
9 p.c. p.a. for 7-J years and 10 p.c. since,
the co. has been improved by an amount ex-
ceeding one-fourth of its present capital,
assuming that ships have been sufficiently
written down for depreciation. The posi-
tion is at present very snug: though the
new Wollongbar and a 1000-ton cargo vessel
were added to the fleet last year, at June
30 the co. held War Loan and cash which
exceeded all outside liabilities by £5950, and
showed £70,340 of book debts, £48,694 of
shares in other cos. and coai and stores
valued at £24,050. Another new, small
cargo steamer has been added since the
accounts closed, and not unlikely final pay-
ments for it were provided for in the “new
steamers account,” which was included with
ship property in the balance-sheet. After
allowing for the final div. there were liquid
assets £139,298 in excess of all liabilities;
and that left £255,416 of capital to be repre-
sented by ship property with a book value of
£394,184 and freeholds included at £28,755.

cern with numerous side-lines tacked to it,
is appealing for new capital to help its ex-
pansion. The purchase of the freehold of
central city premises, establishment of
branches in other States, new rights and
agencies, and a big increase in book debts
(mostly hire-purchase balances) have placed
a strain on finances. The position as at
March 31 was reviewed in detail by the
“Wild Cat” on July 12. The directors are
offering 75,786 of 8 p.c. £1 cumulative
prefs. which share point for point with ordi-
naries to. 10 p.c. and have first call on assets
in a wind-up. For every five prefs. allotted
subscribers have the right to take up one
ordinary, so if both issues are fully sub-
scribed the co. will get £90,923. Most of
the present lot of ordinaries were issued
against goodwill, and when the new shares
are fully paid there will be net tangible
assets for approximately £233,800 to back
£200,000 of pref. capital. The prospects of
10 p.c. divs. make the scrip attractive: last
year’s profits were sufficient to pay 8 p.c. all-
round on all old capital and the lot now
issued, so better returns can be hoped for
when the new* money is put to work. The
lure of the ordinaries is the possibility of
divs. of more than 10 p.c. in years to come;
if the issue is fully subscribed, there will
be £90,826 of ordinaries, but approximately
£57,000 will be represented by the excess of
goodwill over and above accumulated re-
serves.

Nine years ago assets were written up, and
a little later £21,393 of reserves were capi-
talised. Consequently for a time the 7 p.c.
div. on the larger capital was giving share-
holders a point more than they had formerly
received in 10 p.c. divs. In the 1922 finan-
cial year £12,634 of new capital was got
in, and though good profits were earned the
div. rate was not lifted and the average
return fell. However, £2500 of the surplus
was taken to write down goodwill, and dur-
ing the past 12 months reserves were tapped
for £2BOO more to extinguish that intangible
asset. (As goodwill was not regarded as an
asset in the table, the latter does not show
these transfers.) The disclosed profit for the
latest period, apart from the surplus from
sale of property, gave slightly more than 121
p.c. on paid capital, so the div. rate has been
restored to 10 p.c., and that gives old holders
a fat return.
Besides replacing goodwill by tangible
assets, £12,342 of visible reserves have been
accumulated to assist £72,534 of paid capital.

The book value of estates controlled by this
little co. is steadily approaching the four-
million mark. In three years £1,050,000 net
has been added. This rapid progress has
been due to the extension of interests be-
yond Ballarat: a few years ago a branch
was established at Geelong, and in 1921 it
opened in Collins-street, Melbourne. Iu
1912, when the co. had been in business
nearly 25 years, the trust account totted
up £1,606,000. Gross profits have expanded
from £4035 to £17,123, but expenses have
increased in much greater ratio, and net
profits have improved only £1564. However,
shareholders are doing very well: their paid
capital is £31,250, and because £lO,OOO of it
is transferred profit the 11 p.c. divs. are
very sweet. Incidentally, £26,000-odd of re-
serves have accumulated. The co. holds
£45,057 of gilt-edged securities, but they are
mostly pre-war investments, and the average
rate of interest is probably not more than
4 p.c. Even that covers half the amount
required for 11 p.c. divs. Other assets are
properties and office equipment, £10,502; and
cash, £3770. As usual, the published balance-
sheet shows no creditors. The co.’s only
liability is in respect of its undertakings
under wills, etc., and that liability is con-
tingent on the management and staff be-
having themselves and’ carrying out instruc-
tions, to the letter, so that there will be no
misdirection of trust funds. Besides. £57,352

principal by bungling or fraud, there is

holders. Div. prospects are very bright:
last year’s net profit returned 17 p.c. on paid
capital, and no doubt the more toothsome
pickings of the newer business have yet to
be earned.
The Commonwealth Taxation Department
might make a lot fewer enemies and the
Federal system a lot more friends if it mixed
a little oil with its vinegar. Until last year
the Department was interested, so far as
companies are concerned, only in the un-
divided profits: it took 2s. Bd. in the £ of
them—afterwards reduced to 2s. 5d. —and
when and if these profits were afterwards
distributed the individual shareholder got
a rebate to the extent of 2s. Bd. (or 2s. 5d.,
as the case might be). In 1922, however, a
law was passed, and made retrospective, lay-
ing it down that where two-thirds of the
profits were not divided the co. might be
called upon to pay an amount equal to what
would have been paid by the individual
shareholders if the two-thirds had been
divided. There was nothing much to object
to in this, except that retrospective legisla-
tion is wrong in principle; and there would
be little cursing if the collection had been
accompanied by the announcement that, the
tax having been paid at the rate payable by
the individual shareholder, the money might
be divided subsequently without further pay-
ment by the shareholder. In short, that, as
the Department simply collected the tax in
advance, it wouldn’t be interested any further
in the matter. Of course, this was the obvi-
ous intention of the law ; but as it wasn’t
said in so many words —presumably because
Parliament thought it so obvious that
it wasn’t worth saying—the Department
will take no responsibility, and the
cos. that are interested are throwm into
a state of quite unnecessary perturbation and
irritation.

Recent operations at Popo (Papua),
where the Anglo-Persian Co., in conjunction
with the Commonwealth Government, has
been punching down a hole in search of
petroleum, have not been encouraging. The
bore bit down 1860 ft., and though oil
showed in the case and was mixed freely
in the blue mud that seeped into the hole,
no gusher followed. Then the terrific press-
ure started to bend and twist the steel
casing into double-barrelled corkscrew’s, and
drilling was suspended pending the arrival
of heavier casing. Meanwhile the staff was
engaged gouging out a road to _ the site for
No. 2 bore and erecting the rig. The old
casing will need to be drawn in the other
hole before the new lot can be driven down,
and that will take time. The Commonwealth
Government, like many individual contribut-
ing shareholders in prospecting ventures, has
become wearied of ladling out cash; and if
it withdraws the Anglo-Persian will pro-
bably take over the plant and continue on
its own account. The British Government is
a big holder in the Anglo-Persion, but it
is not desirable that that concern should get
control. Though no payable reservoir has
so far been tapped, indications have been
much more favorable than in early develop-
ment of some of the world’s greatest fields.
There is a huge area to prospect, and the
Bruce Ministry should risk a little more
cash before deciding to abandon all interest
in possibilities.

Freney-Kimberley Oil Co. (W.A.) has in-
stalled a boring plant, with which it hopes
to get down 2000 ft. before Christmas. So
far work has been confined mostly to geolo-
gical surveys and putting down trial and
prospecting bores. A start has been made
by Okes-Durack, and from now onwards
drilling should proceed steadily. Meanwhile,
the Kimberley Petroleum Co. is applying for
further exemption on its concessions. The
Bulletin learns from London that attempts
made there to unload these and other West-
ralian areas have failed.
Finances are not so easy with Associated
Oil, Mt. Gambier (S. Aus.), as they should
be. Since the rumpus in the Board room,
which resulted in chairman Gerloff dropping
out, many shareholders have failed to re-
spond to the call for funds. The directors
issued 10,000 new shares to enable driller
Roy Fife to put down test holes to correlate
the work done on the main bore. The re-
sponse was poor. Then a call of 2s. 6d. pay-
able on June 30 was made on the contribs.,
but only 2020 of the 3600 shareholders paid
up. Associated was floated as a limited
liability co., so if the directors are pushed
for funds, defaulting shareholders may be
taken to court. There should, however, be
no need for that: they knew the extent of
their obligations when they entered into the
gamble, and so far they have not paid in
nearly enough to give the thing a chance.
The* main bore went down 2100t't., but drill-
ing was stopped early in May pending the
installation of more powerful pumping plant.
Meanwhile, the first test-bore has been sunk
to about 250 ft.
Golden Horseshoe chairman Purcell is the
latest to complain bitterly about current
mining conditions in Westralia. At the re-
cent meeting in London lie declared that the
West’s gold-mining possibilities would not
become attractive until reductions had been
made in water charges and railway rates
by the State, in Customs tariff by the Com-
monwealth, and in taxation by both Govern-
ments. Nevertheless he expects the Horse-
shoe to survive its many troubles.
Kalgoorlie mine-managers are battling for
a reduction of water charges. Present prices
are from ss. to 7s. 6d. per lOOOgal. Origi-
nally Mundaring weir was designed for the
goldfields; and the metropolitan area was not
to have a drop. But Perth has tapped it
for 250,000,u00ga1. per annum for a number
of years, and has paid only Is. per 1000.

The new manager of Brown’s Reward
(W.A.), having failed to locate anything
worth treating below 40ft., resumed pros-
pecting operations on the surface. The latest
progress report states that a continuation of
Brown’s lode has been located to the north-
east. There it is 3ft. wide, and shows 2oz
values.

The manager of the Lloyd George, Gib-
raltar (W.A.), and option-holders of the
adjoining Carlton lease are indulging in a
display of developmental gymnastics. The
lJoyd George has promised well close to the
Carlton boundary, and the manager con-
siders that if he performs much work there
he will really be proving the value of Carlton
ground. Meanwhile, the Carlton manager
sees no points in pushing development if
there is any likelihood of his neighbor dis-
closing the value of the ground near the
dividing line. Probably the Lloyd George
will eventually buy the Carlton, and, on
present appearances, that course would be
about the best for all concerned. For June
the Lloyd George treated 2150 tons ore and
600 tons sands for a return of £4890.

Mutooroo’s latest Westralian option, the
Mighty Atom, is being billed in Perth and
Adelaide as a “big thing” worth from 3oz.
to soz. per ton and in places 50oz. The
show is at Mt. Varden, 40 miles north of
Laverton, and is in jasper country. Many
similar formations have been worked in the
West, and from one or two. notably the West-
ralia Mt. Morgan, at Morgans, and the
Craigiemore, at Laverton, a lot of gold was
obtained. Most of the others, however,
proved duds at very shallow depths: many
were surface enrichments only.
* * * *
Yilgarn (W.A.) is never short of a rich
show or two. As one fades out another takes
its place. Just now T the May Queen, south
of Southern Cross, shows a 12in. vein worth
soz. down to 245 ft. So far the Owners have
won handsome profits. North of Southern
Cross the owners of the Radio lease treat
30z., and sometimes richer stuff, when they
feel inclined. The prospects of this show
have been good, but development to date has
been limited, and possibilities cannot be
gauged. The May Queen and Radio are
supplying the Westralian Mines Dept, with
specimen ore for the Empire Exhibition.

8., M. and Co.’s glory has departed in the
West. Once the firm controlled 20-odd
mines, including most of the biggest in the
State. Its head offices at Kalgoorlie were
luxuriously furnished, bosses sat in state,
well-groomed secretaries and haughty typistes
flitted hither and thither, and office-boys gave
themselves the airs of star film-artists. In
one ornamental chamber director Herbert
Hoover, now a member of President Hard-
ing’s Cabinet, was to be found dictating re-
ports ; in another W. J. Loring, general-
manager, now seeking the Governorship of
California, was being pumped by newspaper
reporters; in a third mine-managers were
waiting their turn to interview the mighty.
Now most of the furniture, fittings, trim-
mings and trappings are gone, and Bewick-
Moreing interests are tended by a staff of
three, including a typiste and an office-boy.
* * * *
A rich discovery has been made in the
Elsie mine, Mt. Magnet (W.A.). Down
40ft. a lode sft. wide is showing gold freely
right across the ore-body. So far 2500 z.
have been won by dollying, but at present
no estimate has been made of average values.
The choicest rocks go an ounce to the pound,
and there is enough visible gold in the ore
to be particularly pleasing to the prospector-
owner.
Paringa (W.A.) half promised to give the
Daisy Queen, at Lawlers (W.A.), a trial,
but changed its mind, and took an option on
the Hazel, at Waverley. This show was
hawked about Adelaide for some time, but
owing to reports of refractory ore and poor
returns over the plates, it was considered
too risky a venture for even the most ven-
turesome of cos. Nevertheless, Paringa has
decided to give it a go.

Captain McLeod, the one-armed Digger who
went prospecting on the Pilbarra field and
located a gold-bearing reef, reports a big
width of payable stone down 40ft. McLeod’s
success has led to other prospectors trying
their luck in that outlandish region.

Westralian State Mining-Engineer Mont-
gomery reported rather favorably on Jones’s
Concessions, 100 miles from Laverton, but
an expert employed by a group of Adelaide
cos. discarded them, and the cos. took
options on another line of reef two miles
away. Meanwhile, the Concessions people
are opening- up their ground on the lines
advised by Montgomery.

Prospecting and developmental work has
been in progress at the Golden Hope, Hamp-
ton Plains, for nearly four years, and in pro-
gress reports values have been measured in
’weights. A treatment plant has just been
installed, and reports now talk of “good ore.”

Adelong Creek (N.S.W.) went £4068 to
the bad during the past six months. Dry
weather hung up both plants, and the dredges
were in poverty-stricken wash. No. 1 plant
dealt with only 144,000 cub. yd. instead of
over 200,000 yd., and the grade of the ground
was 3.74 d. to meet working costs of 6.72 d.
No. 2 plant, with 197,000 yd., was 100,000 yd.
short of its proper tally, and gold averaged
only 2.38 d. against costs at 4.65 d. Manager
George has been boring ahead of the plants,
and has found heavier ground but better
values. The dredges are now back into the
main-creek fairway, hence George’s expecta-
tions of improved results.

A couple of Melbourne syndicates are busy
on gold, silver and arsenic propositions in the
foothills of the South Coast range, near
Moruya (N.S.vV.). One well-financed crowd
is running a 10-head battery and producing
concentrates worth around £8 per ton from
a silver lode carrying a lot of mispickel. The
concentrates have been treated at Bendigo,
but a plant is being installed to win metals
on the spot. In pre-war days this show was
worked by a German crowd. Another Mel-
bourne venture, backed by followers of Alex.
Peacock, has been tackled by open-cut, and
a 10-head battery and equipment have
started producing concentrates for dispatch
to Bendigo. Syndicates elsewhere are on
promising prospects, but a lot more work is
necessary to establish the size and value of
the lodes; meanwhile the success of the two
svndicates already producing is encouraging.

The B. 11. Prop, is still searching for coal-
mines to feed its Newcastle steelworks. The
co. has been considering numerous leases for

close to the railway.

Manager Meredith has been pushing ahead
with development of the Billy Hughes Co.’s
Bruce mine, Normanby (N.Q.), and is satis-
fied that it will be payable. A shaft has
been sunk on the hillside 30ft. below
the point where a 100 ft. shoot of ore was
opened up, and there a reef Ift. wide has
shown values of loz. 4dwt. over a length of
10ft. Meanwhile, further surface prospect-
ing has responded well to dollying. _ _ Mere-
dith proposes to tackle the proposition by
tunnelling, and that work has already com-
menced. Near by, another reef has been
opened up to a depth of sft. for 12ft., and
values of nearly lloz. have been got. So an-
other new show, the Resurgum, is being added
to the Billy Hughes’s string.

The June crushing of 82oz. from 140 tons
from the Yankee reef, Trentham (Vic.),
has been followed by 87oz. from 150 tons
for July. Both were bulk lots from the
north and south ends. Better-grade stone
has shown up recently, and the syndicate ex-
pects an improvement in the next run.

Leona (Tas.) was registered in Melbourne
in March, and has already commenced tin-
winning. The 65,000 shares are paid to 3s.
The co. owns a freehold block, upon which
no royalties have to be paid, as it was a
Crown grant of about 80 years ago, and no
mineral rights were conveyed in those days.
A lease of 40 acres adjoining is also held.
The ground consists of a river flat and tin-
bearing terraces above it, and the payable
wash averages 10ft. deep, and will produce
from 21b. to 101 b. per sq. yd. Patches are
very rich, going as high as 301 b., but the
average would probably be 31b. per sq. yd.
The property is worked cheaply, the wash
being raised" by a sand pump driven by a
Pelton wheel. All preliminary work has been
done, and profits should show up at once.
The product will average about 72 p.c. tin,
and is free from impurities. About 20,000
shares were taken up by London, and the
balance are held in Tasmania, Victoria and
N. S. Wales in about equal proportions.
Engineer Barton faced a select lot in
Queen-street when he talked about the
Kempf concession on the Waria River (New
Guinea), which he so flatly turned down for
John Brandon’s syndicate. He didn’t have
much trouble in settling the show: he got
Id. prospects., and says that even had values
gone 6d. per c. yd., he wouldn’t have recom-
mended the area. To sugar the pill Barton
came back with an option over 900 acres of
new ground, and also has an eye upon an-
other 240-acre block. The original holder
is to get £5O a month for an option after
the syndicate has had six months in which
to look over the area. If Barton reports
favorably a big co. is to be formed, and the
vendor will get a one-fourth share interest
and £lO,OOO cash. Working capital will be
not less than £BO,OOO. A new option co. of
8000 £1 shares is to be formed to find the
funds with which to send Barton back to
ex-German New Guinea. The vendor gets
1000 shares, and the rest are offered to pre-
sent shareholders in the Waria River Gold
and Platinum Co. If the big concern fol-
lows, the shareholder in this new option co.
will receive 5 fully-paids, and if he is also a
Waria River holder he is to get 7 shares
more—l 2 in all. Neither Barton nor the
directors let out the whereabouts of the new
ground, for Barton wants more country.

Austral Malay and Wightman and Co., of
Rangoon, share the ground-floor in the float
of Austral Malay’s latest offspring, Thab-
awleilc, 75 miles inland from Mergui (Lower
Burma). According to A. W. Freeman,
there are 651 acres averaging l|lb. tin per
yd. suitable for dredging. Depth averages
15Mt., and the estimated yardage is 16 mil-
lions. With tin at £lBO, profits are figured
at 25 p.c., and 30 p.c. with the metal at
£2OO. In a co. of 160,000 £1 shares Austral
Malay scoops 50,000 paids and £lO,OOO in

The popularity of Pioneer Wood Pipe increases
constantly as its advantages become known, and as
its superiority to other types of pipe is demonstrated
by actual service. It is cheaper in the first instance,
lighter to handle and more simple to instal. And
when in use it shows other savings, as it neither

“As regarded Babylon, the old idea of a widely
licentious city was the reverse of the truth.” — Mr.
Joseph McCabe.
No doubt they had their wowsers in
The good old days of old,
Who thundered at the “reign of sin”
That everywhere had hold ;
Perhaps they closed the pubs at six
Back in that ancient time,
And papers (printed then on bricks)
Talked of the “wave of crime.”
Perchance the garb of flappers then —
Cut short and wondrous thin —
Drew howls from sombre, pious men
Who daily searched for sin ;
And all the feasts that Laughter sought
Brought out the wowser’s frown,
Of which gay ladies made a sport
As they gulped cocktails down.
Yet Babylon’s far fame, I fear,
Rests on no greater truth
Than wowser tales that still we hear.
Though in my ardent youth
My pure heart longed for Babylon,
Its yearn to-day finds rest ;
For Sydney is, all said and done, ,
As wicked as the best!
N.S.W. THE ERRING SON.

‘"ILK.”: Dave had just returned to the
Western station from his first visit to the
metropolis. After the initial greetings the
boss gave him a friendly dig in the ribs, and
winking at us, observed, “I’ll bet you gave
the girls a warm time down in Sydney,
Dave.” A disclaimer was naturally ex-
pected, but the station is still chuckling over
the form it took. “No, I didn’t trouble the
girls, Mr. Simpson,” drawled the returned
traveller; “I was more for fruit.”
CAUSE AND EFFECT.
HARRY: “Until this evening my life has been a desert.”
CARRIE: “Oh, that accounts for it —ever since we started dancing
I’ve been thinking of camels and things.”
“Lemmesee”: “Narrabundah’s” par about
the cartridge that exploded when some old
mattresses were being burned at the Molonglo
(N.S.W.) internment camp reminds me of
four Diggers who were cremating some camp
ultra-verminous bed-fixings left by the Hun
at Le Cateau in TB, a few days after the
Armistice. A Mills bomb had somehow-
found its way into the assorted rubbish that
was piled on the fire, and it seized the oppor-
tunity to explode when the party were en-
joying a “bushman’s w-arm.” The fireplace-
top undoubtedly saved their lives, but the
bomb inflicted a number of dishonorable
wounds, from the hips downward. One
philosopher’s comment was unforgetable.
“The old bloke,” he drawled, “was right
about where I’d get it.”
“Alex. Val”: Most Diggers cherish plea-
sant memories of some army forms, especi-
ally the post-Armistice variety. Form 540
(“Application for Non-Military Employ-
ment”) probably had more curses heaped
upon it than any other, while Form 584
("Demobilisation”) gave scope for the most
outrageous irony. On the latter these two
“questions” had to be answered: (1) Is
early return to Australia desired? and (2)
If so, give reasons. The reasons given were
mostly sub-edited by n.c.o.’s, who tilled in
the replies, but occasionally Diggers had a
free hand, and the answers ranged from the
sarcastic “Oh, no; no hurry,” to laborious
disquisitions on the host of things that re-
quired their immedate attention in Australia
—from farms to maiden aunts. But the
palm went to the bloke who, answering with
a brief “Yes,” gave as his reason, “To sec
the sun.”
“Wilfrido” : One man’s whisky is another
man’s bier.
“Randolph Rentless”: The Millions Club
visit to Sydney slums was responsible for
one incident that didn’t get into the dailies.
A small, unkempt and dirty youngster, play-
ing in the gutter, attracted the notice of one
of the visitors, who, after scrutinising the
kid with prolonged and concentrated interest,
gave him a shilling. Next day a big car
arrived in the shabby street, and a benevolent
old gentleman stepped out to seek for some
further information. He got it from a
grumbling dame who was the youngster’s
maternal grandmother. Her daughter—away
working in a factory—had been “took down
by a flash bloke,” and was drawing the usual
ten and sixpence through the Children’s
Court. The car passed swiftly to the Child-
ren’s Court; and next day the old man had
a heated discussion with his son and junior
partner. The Lothario admitted his intrigue
and the use of an assumed name, but sug-
gested that, although he had to pay, the kid
"might be anyone’s.” But the old man, who
had been first struck by the extraordinary
likeness the gutter child bore to his own son
at the same age, flatly declined to accept that
theory. And it looks as if the Millions Club
slumming was going to be highly advanta-
geous to one tiny alley-toddler.
Katoomba”: The
term “ruti” for bread
(B. 12/7/’23) is still
used on windjammers
for the absurdly small
loaves turned out two
or three times a week
by the “doctor.” It
may have a Hindu-
stani origin, but most
sailors would spell it
“rooty.” The shell-
back’s terms for most
of the items on his
bill of fare are crisp
and expressive. For
instance, there is
“Dandy funk,” bis-
cuits crushed up finely
and mixed with mo-
lasses, and then baked
in the oven. “Dog’s
body” is soup, mixed
up with biscuits and
scraps of meat: there-
after baked. “Cracker
hash,” consists of bis-
cuits with fair-sized
pieces of meat, fat
and (if at all pos-
sible) an onion, all
baked as before.
“Spotted Do g” i s
boiled rice w T ith rais-
ins or currants, usu-
ally very messy, un-
less the cook under-
stands rice boiling.
“Harriet Lane” is the
beef and mutton pre-
served in large tins
and issued once or
twdee a week. This
not too appetising
compound is supposed
to derive its title from
a lady of the name
who was once boiled
down in a copper,
according to nautical
legend. Molasses, which sometimes has to
be utilised when dry sweetening runs out,
is “long-tailed sugar.”
“Amyl” : The official figures of the losses
sustained by the sth Divvy at Fleurbaix (B.
2S/6/’23) have been made public in “The
Story of the sth Australian Division,” by
Captain A. D. Ellis, M.C., compiled from
the divisional records, with an introduction
by the divisional commander, General Hobbs.
Ellis states that the total casualties sus-
tained in 24 hours on July 19 and 20 were
178 officers and 5335 other ranks. I thought
there were more. From 3 p.m. on the 19th
to 10 a.m. on the 20th I inhabited a ricketty
dugout in Allar Farm-avenue while a con-
tinuous stream of wounded staggered or
were carried in to me, and I was only one
of 12 regimental M.O.’s engaged in the
same work. The third week of the Somme
push had just been entered on. Our attack,
BROADCASTED.
"They’ve ft new baby.”
“Who told you?”
“I heard it.”
which was primarily intended as a diversion,
had for its object the capture of 4000 yards
of the Aubers Ridge, occupied by the enemy.
Owing to insufficient artillery preparation
on our part, and the fact that the Ilun
knew all about the business at least two
days before it happened, all the latter had
to'do was to call up a couple more divisions
and a few extra guns, and from his position
on the ridge pound Hades out of everybody
and everything. The ill-managed stunt was
doomed to failure from the outset; but the
British High Command got their diversion —
at what a cost! It might be added that the
61st (Tommy) Division were also supposed
to take part, but what they did beyond sus-
taining about 1200 casualties in their own
trenches is nowhere recorded.
“D.” : An elderly woman formed one of a
Sydney deputation of censors hostile to
Norman Lindsay and his art last week. It
was led by David Hall —N. S. M ales’s cen-
sored Attorney-General—and it threatened
inter alia that if the pictures weren’t with-
drawn sabotage would probably be resorted
to. The hostile female had not heard of
Lindsay’s work till last month. Then some-
one told her it was “filthy.” So she hur-
ried to the Education Department Gallery
to see it. Unfortunately, the show was over.
She had been “given to understand,” she told
the Minister, “that the exhibition had been
terminated owing to the public’s protests
against Lindsay’s nudes”; and he did not
trouble to undeceive her. So she never saw
the Lindsay pictures. Nevertheless, still
proceeding on over-the-back-fence evidence
the stuff that is good ‘enough for nine-tenth?
of the lamentable persons who advertise
themselves as reformers —she demanded that
the artist should be disciplined. Lindsay s
pictures may be good or bad. That is not
the point. The point is, if this lady were
charged with keeping a disorderly house,
how would she like to be judged and con-
demned on the tattle of people who had never
seen her and had no personal knowledge
of her? And what would she think of the
people who tried to convict her on such
“evidence”?
* * * *
“Figaro”: How’s this for the Australian
youngster’s pluck and endurance? On Sun-
day, July 1, three boys went out pig-shoot-
ing at. Aramac (Q.). In the excitement of
the chase a rifle in the hands of one of
them went off accidentally, and the buffet
struck a lad of 13 and shattered his lower
jaw, carrying away nearly two-thirds ot the
bone. A doctor, summoned in haste, started
in a car for the scene of the accident, but
he hadn’t travelled a mile from town when
he met the patient riding a bike._ The injured
boy had walked three miles to his bicycle and
ridden two more. He is now in the Aramac
hospital making a good recovery.
“R.F.A.” : After reading some recent pars
about the Ghoorka, I should like to sum-
raarise my experi-
ence of him. Both
on Gallipoli and
in Mesopotamia I
found him a grand
little man, always
cheerful, full of
fun and practical
jokes, and as brave
as a lion. On
Gallipoli he had
few equals in scal-
ing cliffs at night
and surprising the
enemy; and on
Hill 60, when
separated by oniy
10 to 15 yards
from the Turk, he
seemed positively
to enjoy the bomb-
ing. Certainly he
suffered badly in
the blizzard, but
he would crawl on
hands and knees
to the dressing-
station when many
other soldiers were
being carried. In
Mesopotamia I
found him a tire-
less, fearless and
cunning tighter;
also, he had no
equal as a sentry,
and was respon-
sible for more cap-
tures of thieving
Arabs in my area
than the rest of
the troops com-
bin e d. I think
most Aussies were
well content to be
alongside Johnny
Ghoorka, who, in
addition to his
fighting qualities,
was a faithful
friend and never
forgot a kindness
shown him.
“Oxmead”: I wish some local Skeats
would oblige me with the genesis and explain
the metaphor of “pulling your leg,” which
has had me guessing for 30 years. It may
not be an Australian coinage, but I heard
it used here before it ever got into vogue
in England. And while the elucidator is
about it, he might also explain the origin
of “playing the wag” or “wagging it,” which
I never encountered except in Australia. Is
WELL EQUIPPED.
MRS. BYLES: “Mrs. Chatt is a great talker
I’ve only just got away from her.”
MRS. SYLES: “Well, why shouldn’t she he?
She has two motor-cars to brag about
and four servants to complain of.”
“wag” a family connection of the Latin
“vagor” (I wander) and the English “vaga-
bond,” with the “v” Wellerised into a “w,”
or what is it? The slang dictionaries tell
you the meaning of all these phrases, which
everybody knows, but they are exasperatingly
reticent about the derivations, which are so
frequently a puzzle.

THE REJUVENATION OF DRYASDUST.
“Unusual interest was displayed at the Surgical Congress in Dr. Voronoff’s methods of bringing about rejuvenation. The transformation in patients was
surprising. Persons previously thin and decrepit became changed to vigorous men. One who was old and bent previously was shown golfing, walking
and rowing."

“Winkle” : While many deserving Diggers
missed a war pension, others had pern
sions thrust upon them. One trooper, evacu-
ated from his regiment with a high tempera-
ture, reached the field ambulance in Pales-
tine a few minutes before an aeroplane raid.
Though the first bomb fell in the centre of
the hospital-tent, filling it with casualties, he
was uninjured. The doctor, visiting him
for the first time, and finding him so panic-
stricken that it cost him a painiul effort to
force his voice out, refrained from question-
ing him until the shell-shock had abated. In
a day or two the original illness was gone,
but as the jerky impediment in his speech
persisted he was sent down the line. For
several months he was treated in the shell-
shock ward, but with no success. Eventually
he was returned to Australia, and in due
season received a pension. It is still dis-
tressing to listen to his conversation, and
that this impediment will ever be overcome
is unlikely. It has inconvenienced him from
birth.

“Jeames” muses on Gov’ment ’Ouses:—
Lady Forster's, gaffe in connection with Souter
and Sydney artists’ ball recalls that our. Governors
have always been less prone. to succumb to local
influences than their wives. The possible exception
was Lord Hampden, of N. S. Wales.; He appeared
to take Sydney Society with perfect seriousness:
Lord Rosebery’s hilarious comments . ok it, 'for
example, greatly, annoyed him. However, his de-
tractors claimed that it was only the locks of some
of the ladies that Hampden took seriously, and there
may have been something in it. Lord Beauchamp’s
(lassie bloomer about the birthstains was, of course,
born of a too faithful study of Kipling on the
voyage to Albany. When he arrived in Sydney,
he showed himself as tactful as some, and more demo-
cratic than . most. Set against the seidlitz powder
ball, for which his sister was really to blame, his
friendship for Lawson. Lord Dudley had the most
awkward contract of any Australian Governor of
modern times. He arrived at the beginning of
Federal Labor’s first lease of power, and at a time
when support or even tolerance of the R.A.N. wa,s
condemned in the clubs as disloyalty. Yet he
maintained a rigorously correct attitude —and so
WELL AND TRULY SOAKED.
“John, this is positively disgraceful!”
“ ’Tis, m'dear. I'm abs'lutely shertain these sheets have
not been aired.”
earned the distrust of society in the mass.. At least
one millionaire subscriber to the Dreadnought. Fund
refused to meet him. Sir Harry Rawson put his
breezy, quarter-deck foot in it more than once; He
was the .antithesis of Dudley: a new idea exasperated
him. But all was forgiven in his case, chiefly because
of his gentle and charming wife. Many Governors’
wives,, especially the younger ones, make the fatal
mistake of discriminating in favor of the people who
like to be known collectively as the Smart Set —
those who are spending money with spectacular
freedom. Many of these worthies outside the environ-

ment of their diamonds and champagne would be
intolerable; but female dependants of Governors who
would be sensitive-to blatant vulgarity in England
seem to lose their capacity for spotting it in a big
Austtalian * city. > The result is that the solid and well-
bred; women who carry weight in the community are
alienated-; thfy- influence the only public opinion
t'-at counts, arid the Governor suffers in his pro-,
consular reputation. All things considered, the most,
successful Governor imaginable would probably be
an elderly, woman-hating bachelor.
“Howls an’ Blud”: Of all
professions that of crime-detec-
tion is surely the one calling
for the most masterly control
of the temper. It is the only
business in which every time a
crisis arises the office of the
sleuth is invaded by hordes of
callow amateurs —most of them
with “mug” written on every
line of their faces —offering un-
sought advice. It is the only
calling in which, if the offered
advice, however imbecile, is
not at once accepted, the prac-
titioner can rely on being sub-
jected to a lava flow of abuse
in the press. A Judge is in a
far less invidious position than
the men who provide the court
dock with occupants: anyone
who forces advice on a Judge
is likely to be sent to gaol for
his pains. It is interesting to
imagine bow a daily-paper
editor would get on if his office
was periodically rushed by
hordes of lads posturing as ex-
perts and claiming, in roaring
tones, to be able, say, to get
back the lost advts. There is
no doubt that many an editor
would be embarrassed in this
way—the effrontery of a cer-
tain type of youthful male being
illimitable —but for the janitor
who is employed to ward off
drunks, lunatics and nuisances.
The sooner Detective Depart-
ments instal hefty janitors the
worse it will be for crime.
“Rio”: Some recent pars about electricity,
on trains and elsewhere, interfering with the
accuracy of watches remind me of an inci-
dent, at our military topography school. One
of the students, a militia major of fortress
engineers, acquitted himself creditably until
we came to prismatic compass work, when
he simply couldn’t take a correct bearing.
Various compasses were tried with no better
result, until one day the major substi-
tuted his felt hat for the uniform cap he
had been wearing. His bearings were then
found to be quite accurate. Investigation
showed that the peak of the cap had a thin
steel stiffening. Owing to this headgear hav-
ing been worn incessantly close to the genera-
tor of the fortress searchlights, it had be-
come polarised sufficiently to play pranks
with the needle when the compass was held'
to the eye.
“Whitehall” on the sins of the poor:—
First the Sydney artist? and now the Ballarat immi-
grants. This mid-Victorian habit of ascribing immo-
rality to poor, or socially negligible, persons is grow-
ing with our tally of newly-enriched citizens. The
latter derive gratification from the thought that
they are now not only richer but purer, and it pays
a section of the press to humor them. But that
the proposition is transparently idiotic must be
evident to every man of the world. The artists
have one jollo, and some of the people who came
to their beanfeast are presented in the newspapers
as a set of drunken hoodlums who must be prevented
from disgracing themselves by their financial betters
—by people, that is to say, who have probably seen
more ground and lofty inebriation at dances than
the most hilarious artist in Australia. One I. B.
Thompson, welfare superintendent on the Ballarat,
appears to have seared the ears of a daily paper
reporter with some hideous confidences: —
On the question of immorality, I will say there
was it. With regard to the notice that was on
board saying that ladies must be below at 10 o’clock,
it was not carried out. .
In the course of a wandering life I have made| a
dozen or more trips between Australia and England
—most of them on P. and O. ships. After about
a month someone always materialised with stories
of the shocking immoralities that were proceeding
on board. She—the smeller-out of the unmention-
able goings-on was usually a woman —had never
seen the like, and only hoped and prayed that no
daughter of hers would ever be permitted to travel
in such surroundings. It may have been so. With
energy and a pair of good night-glasses one could
no doubt detect quite a, lot of cuddling aboard a
ship manned by Baptist elders. I certainly never
knew a liner in which all the ladies, or anything
like all, went below every night at “lights out.”
But no one rushed with complaints tos, the
papers at the end of the voyage; or if they did
they had no luck in getting their protests published.
Success here, as in the case of the artists’ critics,
is reserved for the people who confine their moral
rebukes to those whom Uriah Heep called “the
’umble.”

“The Wanderer”: It was the enterpris-
ing publican of the Union Inn at Cundle, on
the Manning (where Kendall, the poet, once
lived), who <rave the d str.ct its first “war
specials.” That was 70 years ago, in the
time of the Crimean War and the Indian
Mutiny. A little sailing-ship had been
wrecked near the Manning Heads, and a
small brass cannon was recovered from the
vessel. Bung secured the piece of ordnance,
and whenever a budget of newspapers arrived
he would pour a couple of canisters of gun-
powder into the cannon and let her off—the
charge was doubled or trebled if there was
anything special in the way of news. The
sound rumbled across the islands to Glen-
thorne, Redbank, Taree, down the' plains
to Ghinni and Jones’s Island, and re-echoed
among the foothills and mountain ranges
of Lansdowne and Comboyne. Later on
flotillas of pulling-boats would be seen
coming round all bends of the river, and
horsemen would spur in, all bound for the
Cundle tavern. The war news would be read
and discussed at length, to the consumption
of numerous drinks and much profit to Boni-
face. The cannon is still in existence, but
its boom is never heard these days. In fact,
there isn’t even a pub in Cundle nowatimes
—it’s as dry as a wooden god.

“Copabella” on the disappointments of
Art: —
Charcoal was intrigued to receive in a feminine
hand a letter bidding him call for a purpose to be
explained on acquaintance. The address was in an
obscure street of a push-haunted suburb. Recent
marriage not having quite killed his fondness for
adventure, Charcoal decided to go. Native caution •
and the reputation of the suburb led him, how-
ever, to enlist the company of a friend and to
chance three being a crowd. The friend, with
memories of the movies, dropped a, revolver in tin
pocket of his overcoat. The assignator’s street
proved to be a typical one for the hiding of pushes
and for garrottings. Her house stood back from
the building line where no street light fell. A cheap
oil-lamp in a front window made the darkness o)
the house visible.
As the visitors traversed a weed-grown front
garden and tapped on a weather-beaten door, Char-
coal wished he had left the adventure alone. His
friend had no illusions ; he charged his gun and held
it cocked under cover of his pocket as the door was
opened.
The appearance of a little faded woman reassured
Charcoal for the moment. There was' nothing of the
decoy about her looks. Her invitation- to enter was
accepted. Her next remark, however, awakened old
suspicions. “Won’t you take otf your overcoats?’’
she said, and Charcoal could have sworn she looked
meaningly at the bulge in the pocket of Charcoal’s
valiant mate. They excused themselves nervously
and settled down to swelter in the lady’s airless
parlor. Saying she had something to show them, she
left the room. She returned with a ribbon-tied
parcel, materialising like a wraith from the shadowy
background. The adventurers jumped as they real-
ised that during her absence their host had become
three! The other two stood, half-defined in the dim
light, slightly less decayed, copies of Madame Mys-
tery. All three watched the untying of the parcel
reverently.
“My daughters,” said Madame —“you will notice
they are twins —have written a book. It will require
to be illustrated when we secure a publisher,
and” :
Sighing eloquently Charcoal and Co. unbuttoned
and shed two great-coats.
“We decided that we liked your style of art best,”
continued Madame, with a simplicity which was a
compliment.
It is unlikely that “A Novel in Three Volumes, by
Twin Sisters, Illustrated by ‘Charcoal,’ ” will be
one of the season’s literary events. Charcoal thinks
in guineas, and the three Graces, who buy Charcoal’s
paper (containing three to four Charcoal sketches)
for sixpence, were estimating their illustration costs
on something about that scale.
“Steve Hart”: I dissent from the proposi-
tion submitted by “Cartot” (B. 19/7/’23)
that the dominant complexion of Australian
children is dark. It is possible that it may
be so in the big centres, but a trip to any
out-back school would soon convince “Cartot”
that fair-haired children preponderate, fully
seven in ten having grey or blue eyes. Resi-
dence in warm latitudes would not affect this
quality. Has “Cartot” ever heard of the

eight Dutch suffers, with their wives, who were
placed on the little island of Kissa. by the
Netherlands!' EflfSt India Co. to watch the
actions of the, Portuguese in 1665? The
little community was forgotten for 250 years,
and in that time increased to 300. And,
according to Professor Macmillan Brown, the
majority had fair complexions, light hair
and blue eyes in 1914. Kissa is only a few
miles off the most easterly point of Timor.
WINTER SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sharp airs and pink noses,
The winter is here;
The grey evening closes,
The white stars are clear.
The airs have grown crisper.
They crackle the tin
Of the roof like a whisper
Of delicate sin.
My fancy needs thawing;
It’s glued to my head —•
Oh. murder! The gnawing
White pain of the bed!

Jethro Brown, president of S.A. Indus-
trial Court, who is sometimes charged with
having insufficient practical experience, was
born on a South Aus. farm, and till man-
hood did all kinds of farm work; then he
went with Dr. Torr, a Methodist of mark
and money, to
study in England.
When he got his
degree he moved on
t o U.S.A., and
from there made a
dozen trips as
working hand on
Transatlantic lin-
ers. It may be a
further qualifica-
tion that, though
guilty of a law
text-book or two,
he hasn’t actually
chased Costs, and
was admitted
(4912) only three
years before he
climbed on to the
Bench. Ke is still
in the fifties.
“HAPPY HARRY”
APLIN . House-
keeper for the
Federal Senate;
he has spent 47
years looking after
the comfort of
Parliaments—25
years in S. Aus.
and 22 years in
Melbourne.
The late Thomas Gill, one time Under-
Treasurer in S. Aus., gave budgets to seven
Treasurers, and help to seventy times seven
private citizens. He started life as stamp
boy in the Military Department in the days
when O.S. stamps were not, and when clerks
drew on the stamp account till next pay-day.
The stamp boy had to report one too-vigorous
loan converter (say Robinson), who was
thereupon retired, took to the Stock Exchange,
made and lost two fortunes, and in old age,
plug-hatted and frock-coated, haunted the
steps of ’Change. Thence he used to fall
privily but dramatically on the Under-
Treasurer as lie passed to the Treasury with :
“Mr. Thomas Gill! Albert Edward Robin-
son had no breakfast to-day. What have you
to say to that?” He always got his break-
fast. There will be a large surplus in the
old Under-Treasurer’s budget Out Beyond.
“Uramao”: Artists whose
works are a drug on the
market may draw what con-
solation they can from the
sequel to the death of C. N.
Worsley. Within a few
days of the cable from Lon-
don announcing the paint-
er’s demise ;a Christchurch
dealer sold £6OO worth of
Worsley’s works. In Auck-
land, on the very morning
of the cable announcement,
a dealer had several in-
quiries about the dead man's
canvases, and most of them
resulted in business.
The Verran family seems
to have bad luck, politically
speaking. In 1921, just
when old John, though ex-
Premier of a Labor Govern-
ment in S.A., was dropped
by the party for being a
“Nationalist,” his son J.S
was elected for Port Adel-
aide with Price, son of an-
other (now deceased) Labor
Premier. Price is the sort
of talkative little chap that
newspaper men poke fun at,
but he has the confidence of
his party, and the Labor
plebiscite for the next gen-
eral election has now brack-
eted him with Condon, of
the local Town Council, for
the two safe seats; so
young Verran looks like
having to hunt for a nomi-
nation in some other district
where prospects are less gilt-edged.
Dr. J. M. Creed is the father of N.
S. Wales Leg. Council since the resignation
of Henry Moses, who is 90, 10 years older
than the combative doctor.
Westralia has parted with its two speakers
best worth listening to —Hal Colebatch,
bound for London and the Agency-General;
and Walter Kingsmill, now Senator. No
new member has made a more effective con-
tribution this session than Kingsmill, whoso
initial speech was easy, well-phrased and
full of shrewdness and humor. Kingsmill
was Acting-Premier of W.A. over 20 years
ago, and later was commissioned to form a
Ministry, but he only managed to do it by
parting with the leadership in the process.
Later he found it more congenial to ex-
change fighting politics for steady Parlia-
mentary jobs—he was ultimately President
of the Groper Upper House. In fact, he
finally lost his seat in the Leg. Council be-
cause he jibbed at being partisan enough,
even at election time, to submit himself,
wig in hand, for a party nomination.
There was no better judge of the thor-
oughbred than just-dead Tom Willis, for 26
years “Milroy,” of the Sydney Mail. The
big, hard-bitten scribe had a host of friends
all over Australia, was a welcome guest at
many squattages and studs whenever he
cared to drop in, and his advice at the year-
ling sales was valued. No man was more
familiar with the Bruce Lowe figure-system
of thoroughbred-raising than he. A good
Australian —he was born at Mudgee
(N.S.W.) 66 years ago—he always had a
warm spot in his heart for the home-bred
prad, and an unmatchable contempt for
some of the imported stallions. Willis had
an amazing stock of yarns, but one of the
best he used to tell against himself. At a
very convivial country race-meeting he was
appointed judge for the last race because
three other judges were sozzled. There were
two horses only in the event —a white and
a black—and they battled out a close finish.
The crowd gathered round the judge’s box
awaiting his verdict. “Who won, mister?”
one chap inquired. Willis with some diffi-
culty steadied himself and replied: “The pie-
bald, of course—there wasn’t another horse
in sight!” Tom, who was a brother of W. N.
Willis-—and not a bit proud of the fact—
left a widow, a married daughter and a son,
Norman, who also writes about horses.
When Bolton Stafford Bird hops from the
Speck’s political perch in May next, as he
says he will, the Greybeard Chamber will
lose its oldest inhabitant. Bird has been in
the Tas. Parliament since 1882, and his jobs
have included Deputy-Premier, Treasurer,
Minister of Education, Minister of Railways,
Postmaster-General, Leader of the Opposi-
tion and Speaker of the Assembly. Like
Attorney-General Propsting, he graduated
from the Assembly to the Council, but it
was when his active work was over, and not,
as in Propsting’s case, because the Uppah
House was short of Ministers. Bird was
also one of the Tas. delegates to the Federal
Conferences of 1890-91.
Owing to the eternal disputes at New-
castle and Maitland, Charles M. McDonald,
sec. of the Northern Coal-owners’ Assoc.,
gets as much publicity as a movie star longs
for. As a boy in the Adelaide Steamship
Co.’s Melbourne office McDonald caught the
manager’s eye and eventually tilled pro tern.

ship of the Steamship-owners’ Assoc, were

offered hiin at the same time, and he chose
the S.O.A. Later the North Coast and
Howard Smith cos. provided his daily crust.
McDonald tells a good yarn, handles a
racquet well, and knows a menu-card like a
maitre <V hotel. His verbal duels with Hig-
gins, J., on shipping awards made him an
outstanding figure when Tom Walsh was on
the warpath, and when the dust of battle
cleared Higgins said McDonald had missed
his vocation and Australia a great lawyer.
The shadows are closing in on Prof. Alex-
ander McAuiay, of the Tasmanian ’Varsity.
Mathematics is his cult, and he has invented
formulas which have won him fame in scien-
tific circles. His University thought so much
of his researches that it released him from
other work, and he was aiming at a book
covering the fruits of his studies. Now he
has been told that lie will be blind in three
months. He is standing up under the sen-
tence with cheerful philosophy, and is train-
ing himself in Braille writing and reading to
be able to carry on when darkness comes.
Experiences are crowding upon George
Farrell, M.L.A. for Rockhampton (Q.). In
the course of five months George has fought
two elections, in both of which he was suc-
cessful, and defended a suit for breach of
promise. In that he was unsuccessful. And
the leading issue at the first of the elections
was that he hadn’t married another girl.
Nathaniel Bennett, the oldest laborer in
the Methody vineyard in Vic., crossed over
to the Beyond last week. He began his toil
12 years ago at the age of 19. The family
is not likely to fade out soon, as he left four
sons and five daughters. Two of the boys
took to the cloth—one is master of King’s
College, Brisbane, the other keeps i£ie flock
at Shepparton (Vic.).
June 25 last was the centenary of the first
marriage in Maoriland; it took place at the
Bay of Islands before parson Thos. Kendall
(C. of E.). Philip Tapsell, first mate of the
ship Asp, and Maria Ringa, a Maori of high
degree, were the contracting parties. Philip,
with his dusky bride, settled in the Bay of
Plenty, where their descendants are a power
in the land unto this day.
Edgar Bean, new Parliamentary draughts-
man in S.A., has seen more of the world
than most lawyers of 30. Melbourne born,
he was educated in Westralia, then moved
on to Adelaide ’Varsity, to Oxford, to France
for three years’ service, back to Oxford for
the 8.A., and back to Adelaide for the LL.B.
Lately he has been associate to Judge Poole ;
and now he takes the job of making legisla-
tors’ English ship-shape and pointing out
that an amendment to Clause 42b will make
hash of Clause 167.
“Jeff” : There is going to be a rare fight for
the Chief Justiceship of Maoriland' when Stout
decides to call it a go. Of the several K.C.’s
who are thought to have their eyes on it the
most fancied is C. I\ Skerrett, brainy and a
good chap to boot; but whether he will be
willing to give up a lucrative practice for
the seat of the mighty is open to question.
Alexander Gray, K.C., and John Findlay,
who has found that strict attention to law
pays better than flirting with politics, are
both in the betting, but at longer odds. The
law as it stands prevents a sitting Judge
from getting the job, but an amendment may
be made setting that anomaly aside. If this
is done it would not be surprising if John
Salmond stepped un. However, Stout won’t
give in until he has to, so the question may
remain open for a year or more yet.
Australia is acquiring a former Naval
man as sky pilot—ex-Lieuit.-Commander
James Makgill Crichton, who has been 18
years in the service. He fought through the
war and was at Jutland; but when the
“cease fire” sounded he set about studying
for the church, and now starts work in North
Queensland.
Patrick Kennedy, M. 8., who died at
Albury the other day, was the doyen of medi-
cal men in southern N. S. Wales, and had
his finger on the pulse of that territory for
nearly half a century. In his younger days
he was an enthusiastic mining speculator,
and most ventures within coo-ee of him car-
ried at least a few of his pounds below.
His innings closed at 71.
“Tally Ho”: Tetley Gant, who passed his
67th milestone on July 19, has completed 16
years as President of the Speck’s Leg. Coun-
cil. Until recently he was in legal partner-
ship with Elliott Lewis—-Gant being the
family solicitor while Lewis attended to the
courts. Between them they gave ex-Senator
J. 11. Keating his first lessons in legal prac-
tice ; perhaps also in politics, for Lewis was
Attorney-General while Keating was still
serving his articles. Gant broke into politics
in 1901, and has been a steady supporter of
the established order. He is Chancellor of
the Tasmanian ’Varsity, and his tolerance of
the students’ Commem. foolery has Won him
a warm corner in their hearts.
“Alex. Val”: During the 1912 Brisbane
tramways strike a a
old chap, after
heaping curses on
all concerned, made
a vow never to
ride in one of
“Badger’s ’buses”
again. Since then
he has Walked
every day from his
home in Coorparoo
to his work in
Fortitude Valley
and back, the dis-
tance being about
five miles each
way, through some
of the dirtiest
streets imaginable,
though he is now
well over 60. A
few months ago,
when the trams
passed to munici-
pal control, there
was much specula-
tion as to whether
the feudist would
call it square. But
he remains ada-
mant, and the 1
trams continue to
lose a customer, to
the profit of the
bootmaker.
J. M. FORDE ,
Labor member for
Caprieornia in the
Federal Reps.
A tip from the Gallery:—
Watch Francis Michael Fordc, the new member foi
Caprieornia, in the House of Reps. He intends to be
something in the councils of the nation, and his
ambition is published by his alert manner, his bulg-
ing attache case and his furrowed brow. His corres-
pondence is enormous—he is nursing his constitu-
ents with a solicitude that his predecessor never
showed. During the recent all-night sitting Forde
applied himself to the papers in his fat brown case
rather than pursue his companions’ idle pastime of
heaving wordy bricks at an unheeding Government.
He is a good-looking young man, nicely attired, and
is accounted to have a passion for Portland vests.
Like the equally presentable Edward Charles Riley,
the son of the popular monument for South Sydney,
he sits wrapped in judicial calm on the back Oppo-
sition bench when not engaged in overworking the
Post Office. Some already declare that he will go
far, given reasonable luck at the polls. Certainly he
seems the most promising of the new young men.
A PLEA FOR ASPHODEL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Anglican Prayer Book has been amended by
the excision or alteration of certain passages out of
keeping with modern ideas.”
The Psalms that flowed from David’s pen
Were full of savagery and hate;
An overhauling, now and then,
Avails to bring them up to date.
The Hell that old-time preachers drew,
Where sinners in (sternum blaze,
You seldom hear allusions to
From pulpits, these enlightened days.
Fain would I see revision come
Of realms celestial as well;
As sketched in hymns they make me glum
Compared with old Elysium
Amid the fields of Asphodel.
No Heav’n for me where harps are smote
And white-robed seraphs chant and trill!
In truth I never knew a note
Of music—and I never will.
I wouldn’t give a fico for
The most melodious choir that sings;
All crowns as flummery I abhor
And precious stones as garish things.
There may be Paradise for some
Where million-power organs swell
And hosts angelic go and come.
I’d rather seek Elysium
Amid the fields of Asphodel.
Where game is thick on plain and hill
The Indian hunter heads, deceased;
Belike in high Valhalla still
Great ghostly Vikings tope and feast;
Inside the bourne, beyond the gate,
Where all must pass and none recede,
’Tis said that moon-faced houris wait
Souls that were true to Islam’s treed.
To each his Heav’n —with beat of drum,
With song and shout, with chime or bell,
With cooing doves or bees that hum ;
My vote is for Elysium
Amid the fields of Asphodel.
Dogma—and Hell —to meet the times
The Church amends and modifies;
The notion of celestial climes
Most favored it may next revise.
The glittering scene, the splendid state,
The clouds of glory that they stress,
Seem highly liable to grate
On those who yearn for restfulness.
And now the dourest preacher’s dumb
Concerning a material Hell,
Why shouldn’t a Heav’n of clang and strum
Be scrapped for an Elysium
Amid the fields of Asphodel?

HUDSON SUPER-SIX
THE MOST
V
RESPECTED
CAR.
YOU find comparison for HUDSON quality only
in the small group of fine cars that stand at the
very front of mechanical excellence, and which
cost many times the price of the Super-Six.
Nothing an owner, or we ourselves, can say will
give you fully what this quality feeling means. But
if you drive a HUDSON you will immediately under-
stand what is meant when its ease of operation,
smoothness, reserve of power and reliability are
spoken of.
Don’t choose a HUDSON merely by what you *
have heard of its quality. Match it against any car
you know. Ask the opinion of owners who have had
their HUDSONS for years; then you will understand
why the HUDSON is “the most respected car.’’
Then, too, you will know why the HUDSON
requires so little attention, why its performance is so
unusual, and why owners are so outspoken in their
endorsement.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
“Myalla” : Fate is still taking a hand in
the Queer Accident game. ’l’he other day Jim
Hatcher and a small boy, of Oakwood, in the Inverell
(N.S.W.) district, were out shooting, and came across
a fox concealed in a tree easily scaled from rhe
ground, as it was bending at an acute angle. Hatcher
fired and Reynard fell back into the gaping hollow
of the tree. The boy refused to try getting him out,
so Hatcher entered the log head first. He had pene-
trated some depth, and then found he couldn’t make
the return journey. The boy, after making vain
efforts to drag him out, ran to the nearest neigh-
bors. When help arrived Hatcher was in a bad way.
After supporting himself a long time on his hands
they became too cramped, and he had to rest on his
head —and nearly smothered while he was doing it.
It was only with great difficulty he was got out.
This is the first time I’ve known of a man standing
on his head in a hollow tree, but perhaps it’s hap-
pened before.
THE ARTISTS' BALL.
NED : “Well, what think you of my costume,
Dan Morgan?"
DAN : “ Strut h, Ned Kelly, mine eyes have
not seen better since I was last in the
horrors."
“A. de L.”: In the ranges S.W. of the
Gulf of Carpentaria, in cavities on the face of per-
pendicular cliffs, there live beautiful fur-adorned
little creatures to which, so far, I have seen no
reference by zoologists. They are a kind of rock-
wallaby, very shy and rare and seldom seen in day
time; the size of the domestic cat, and black, yellow-
isn or white-grey, though sometimes the three colors
adorn the same furred garment. The little fellows
have a dreaded enemy in the large eaglehawk, which
may be seen hovering above the cliffs in constant
vigil, ready to swoop on the first hopper who dares
venture out of its cavity. What docs the Abo. council
know of these cave-dwellers?
“Albany Pass”: Various theorists have
asked why the Polynesians did not discover Australia,
or if they did why they did not occupy it. The
Maoris, like the Morioris before them, found their
way to the Shivery Isles. There are indications
that they even touched at Norfolk Island in the
course of their voyaging. Ethnologists find -traces
of them on the coast of New Guinea, and possibly
even in the islands of Torres Strait. Yet there is
no evidence that they ever set foot in Australia.
The case of the Torres Strait Islanders, a people <>i
the Papuan type, offers
an even’ more difficult
puzzle. Here they were,
established within a
few miles of Australia,
a bold, active and war-
like race of skilled sea-
farers. Flinders, no
mean judge, says in
describing the Darnley
Islanders (he saw them
in 1792, at a time when
they were untouched by
European influences):
“No boats could have
been manoeuvred more
dexterously in working
to windward than were
these long canoes by
the naked savages.”
They were well armed,
too, with bows and
arrows, and the Austra-
lian aborigines 1 could
not have stood against
them for a moment.
Not only were they
established almost with-
in sight of Australia,
but they used to work
their way down by sea
at least a s far as Cape
Grenville. Yet they
never seem to have
attempted to settle on
the coast of Australia,
and the signs of any
WHERE THE STARS ARE RUSHLIGHTS.
SALESMAN : “On the roads you have here, sir, you would find this
car far better than a better one.”
influence that they might have had on the
aborigines of the Far North are slight at best
and very doubtful. R. L. Jack expresses the
opinion, in his “Northmost Australia,” that they'
had not been in the Torres Strait Islands long
enough to make any serious attempts to occupy tne
mainland; but I don’t think much of that guess.

“Sir Spen”: “Talkin’ of smart c-oves,”
said Scott, “reminds me of Mick Maguire. Mick
useter hoof it round th’ sheds th’ same as us in
th’ good old days. Larstime I met ’im ’e was
cornin’ back on th’ long tramp from Idontwantergo-
bung, and ’is ole dorg, Flossie, was trailin’ close
behind him. ’E wus carryin’ a billy, an’ I
noticed stickin’ outer the top was the. three little
’eads of Flossie’s young family, ‘You’re mighty
kind to them pups, Mick,’ says I. ‘Oh, I dunno,’
says Mick, ‘they’re doin’ me a good turn, yer
know.’ ‘’Ow?’ I asks ’im. ‘Well, yer see,’ says
’e, ‘we ’ad stoo fer dinner to-day, and there’s some
left over. I sticks a bit of tin over it, and now
I’m doin’ the pups a good turn be carryin’ ’em,
an’ they’re doin’ me a good turn be keepiri the
stoo warm.’ ”
“W.11.E.”: “Ned Kelly” (B. 12/7/’23)
thinks the big appendage to the fantail's wonder-
ful nest is neither useful nor ornamental. Cranky
Fanny selects the thinnest and most resilient out-
lying branch, and the choice is always made with
remarkable instinct. The greatest enemies 0 f bush
birds are goannas and snakes, so the fantail, with
a lively appreciation of this fact, builds its nest
near the extreme end of the chosen branch and
attaches a long, purse-like tail, evidently to give
it additional weight, or to -catch every passing
breeze, thus causing the slender branch to sway
about and impress upon any sneak-thief crawler the
risk of breaking the frail support in an attempt
to reach the nest. There’s something sensible and
useful in everything the fantail and his near relation
the willy-wagtail do —and that’s more than can be
truthfully said of any of the imported feathers.
“Moon-ta”: Re the Animal Speed Stakes.
“N’importe” (B. 28/6/’’23) quotes Polly, a whippet,
as doing 100yds. in Another Ben, a grey-
hound puppy in the Puppy Event at Freeling (S.
Aus.), in May last, ran the length of the enclosure,
827yds., in 27sec., over very rough ground, without
turning the hare. This works out at about 3jsec. for
100yds,, thus showing phenomenal speed with great
staying power for both hare and hound.
* * * *
“Baro” : I have just come across the state-
ment that a bushy can’t bake a damper without a
sufficiency of white ashes, and. is therefore forced
to cook johnny-cakes on the red coals. That was
the first instruction I received when learning damper-
making,; ..but the theory sags a good deal in the
middle. When humping matilda in Westralia I
baked many a damper in the red hot coals. I tried
it because I didn’t like johnny-cakes. In the
morning I made ,a mound of red coals remaining
from the dead tree which had served to illuminate
the library "the night before. Beside it, with a bark
shovel, I made a heap of sand. After mixing the
dough I made a well in the coals; then, doing the
greased-lightning act, 1 threw in the dough, covered
it with the coals, and smothered thji lot with the
sand. The result was delicious hot bread for break-
fast. Any bushie knows that to cut a hot damper
spoils it; hut I could never resist the delicacy.
Of course, after using sand, the ashes are of no
further use.
“Strenuous”: The lady who kept the
“triantelopes” in the bedroom to deal with the flies
reminds me that last summer I spent the night at
a little country farm-house, and during the evening
Cocky, pointing to three tarantulas on the ceiling,
said, “See those fellows? Well, they’re the best
bug-exterminators in the world. If you’d stayed
here 12 months ago you’d have been big-game hunt-
ing all night. A traveller told me to get some
of them —there’s plenty in the hush ; find ’em under
the bark of old logs and stumps. So I imported a
few, and —well, I think you’ll have a peaceful sleep
to-night.” Which I did.

“The Rumpus”: Re biltong in Australia
(B. 5/7/’23). In 1905 I was at the Top Camp, over
200 miles inland from the N.W. coast of Westralia,
then deserted except for a few old fossicking hatters.
Their main article of consumption was dried pieces
of kangaroo. These were like chips of wood, and as
hard. The artist who prepared them was a swivel-eyed
half-caste, and 'outside his humpy there were always
strips of drying ’roo on a string.

“Leo Lear”: That useful and interesting-
night bird, the tawny frogmouth (Podargus), depends
altogether on his protective coloring in times of
danger. On a rough
morning in June I
found one on a kero-
sene case in an open
shed. Children and
cats passed near the
bird, which never
moved an eyelid, but
remained stiffly erec t
like a grey stick. It
was only when I stroked
his back feathers that
he flew to a near-by
tree. Podargus is about
the ugliest bird we
have, but is a whale on
insects. It is almost impossible to see them in the
day-time, as they maintain the stick-like attitude.
Even when one is sitting on the nest all that can be
seen is a slightly larger stick poking fore-and-aft over
a bunch of other sticks. By the way, if you want to
keep out of an argument don’t mention that frog-
mouth’s call is “oom-oom” or “morepork.”
“The R.” : Recently, in Perth, two horses
attached to a lorry, had an unauthorised run of a
little over half-a-mile through the streets. By
singular misadventure, both dragged their headgear
off at the same time through rubbing their ears
against the ring of the pole. Their sudden new
viewpoint of the load they were asked to pull sent
them .careering out of the open gate of the goods yard,
and, full steam up, they tore along Melbourne-road,
turned into Wellington-street, and sent everybody
scurrying for,;safety. Finally they pulled up dead
on the metal plate of a city weighbridge. And the
peculiar thing is, neither horse had ever pulled
a load on that weighing-machine before. If those
prads weren’t asking a question, I’ll go inside.

“Capta”: Re this matter of blastiferous
bu'llockies (B. 14/6/’23), Bob is quiet and even-
tempered, his bullocks are well-conditioned and
contented and could pull the deficit off a State-
owned enterprise. George is loud and linguistic,
his bulls are lean and mean, and have to hump
to pull grass. They were reared on a diet Of the
99 wonderful names of Allah, from Ar-Rahmftn
to Az-Zaboor, and many derisive and foam-
ing references to the want of chastity in their
female progenitors. The bullock is a fool, and
slowly absorbs one idea at a time, which is tin
reason why Bob’s savvy “Whoa-whoa-baek,” ami
Why George’s have to hesitate and choose between
“Whay-yuh -, whobbeh,” and a string of smell-
ful language. In plain fact, Nobby doesn’t know
whether to dig in his toes and graft, or turn round
and streak for home when he is called on to pick
out an order sandwiched with 40 kinds of blanky.
110 can, with ordinary care, distinguish a spade
as a spade, but his mentality refuses to be flustered
into understanding it as a vermilion shovel. So
long as men are conceited and impatient, and
until the hornies develop a reasoning brain, we shall
meet the whip-and-tongue expert who flays and
curses his dumb beasts into a frenzy that militates
against their assimilation of his orders. But the
Bobs of the game will always show them points.
* * * *
“Col. Mutt” : Here’s a regular old hatter’s
idea. Years ago I got off my bearings In the
Gippsland bush,, and, landing at a bark liut be-
longing to one of the tribe, 1 decided to J?ut up
there for the night. Beyond a (grant of* two, I
could got nothing out of him during tea and the
evening smoke. His hunk whs on the floor, so I
chucked my blankets down toO, Before we turned
in he mixed some pollard and water ifl im old tin
basin. This he placed near the head of Iris bed,
and I went to sleep wondering why. In the chill
hours of the morning I was wakened by a load
“Pang! Pang, pang-pang I” sounding through the
hut. I looked up to see about a score of hungry
fowls pecking away at the tin of pollard. It was
the old cove’s alarm-clock.
>J I % * *
“Kenbir” : Binghi’s totemistic system is
a curious business, lie even gives a “bush brother”
to the white man. I myself am saddled with a wild
relation, as the tribes I have met with believe that
“my brother that walkabout longa scrub him bin
name curlew”—though 1 think my ability to success-
fully imitate the wailing- cry at night had something
to do with the relationship. The white hunter who
engages a guide must Carefully ascertain the name of
the latter’s “brother” before going Out, and be sure
not to shoot that particular animal or bird, or
there’ll be trouble.

chap in The Bully has been saying that greeii paw-
paw is poisonous and contains arsenic, Rats 1 Boilod
it is very good, ahd both looks and tastes like
vegetable-marrow, It is the one vegetable that
I can always get (it grows very abundantly out
here), and I must have consumed a good deal of
it in the last few years J yet 1 have felt no ill
effects. The ripe fruit is very palatable ahd is
said to be a good digestive. Incidentally, raw
meat wrapped in pawpaw leaves becomes remark-
ably tender.

“Orion”: Re “Coralco” (B. 12/7/’23) on
Binghi’s method of collecting emus. I’ve seen
abos. catch ’em with two stones, about as big as a
shut fist, securely fastened together with a thong of
kangaroo hide about 3ft. long. Creeping up to
within throwing distance the black would take the
thong in the middle, whirl it around and let fly.
In the flight the stones would separate, and if the
thong happened to strike the neck or leg the emu

was a goner. The stories lapped round and round,
and thus made him an easy prey. It is a curious
fact that a similar idea is used by the Gauchos of
S. America. Their apparatus has either two or
three weights. When three are used the third is
attached to a cord nearly half as long as the main
line at.a point bisecting it.

“Tarago”: While the Council is discuss-
ing the paddy-melon, can anyone say how the little

FARM SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Out in the pleasant autumn morn Millicent goes
singing,
Hair the hue of ripened corn, empty pail a-swinging;
The mild-eyed cows by the milking-bails know her
merry laughter,
That rings as she lowers rough grey rails, with a
song to follow after!
Then ho 1 for milk that’s foaming down,
Beneath firm fingers streaming,
Like glacier snows that drift a-doze
O’er bronze-dark stones and gleaming!
This Sunday, in the kitchen’s shade, Melissa frowns
and fusses
O’er savory herb-dressing made, when fowls she
cleans and trusses;
Here are plump cabbages and green, and lettuce
milder tinted,
Smooth conical brown cakes are seen, piled tier on
tier unstinted.
Then ho! for bread like driven snow,
All of Melissa’s baking;
For scones fresh-made, and marmalade,
And jelly coldly shaking!
Both maids are in the orchard now, under the
blushing cover
Of peachbloom fair as each fair crown, each talkirg
with her lover ;
Melissa’s eyes of blue are hid, with never upward
glancing,
But Millicent’s will shine unbid, all laughter-lit and
dancing !
Then ho! for gold moon rising late,
And hasting, ere she misses
Tanned lovers strong, who linger long,
Bestowing farewell kisses!

“Two Seas”: Even “Bung’s” entry (B.
5/7/’23) for the capless wheel stakes will have to
be! scratched, for his nomination, Bill Sherd, knew
he had lost a wheel and repaired the deficiency with
a sapling, whereas my nomination didn’t. It hap-
pened thus. I found the wheel about two miles
south of Goulburn lying by the roadside. Cantering
along I overtook an Army Service waggon which
was minus a hind wheel. There were two drivers
riding postilion; three warriors sat on top of the
load, and another acted as escort. It was a wildly
hilarious sight to see that A.S. waggon bowling
merrily along on its precarious course with the war-
riors admiring the scenery, feeling, no doubt, that
all was well -while the watchful escort rode gravely
alongside of the chariot. A thirsty soul seated on
the verandah of Mandelson’s Hotel drew attention
to the fact of the missing wheel, but none of the
warriors was much disturbed. The escort asked me
if I had noticed it on the road, and when I told him
it was warning for him two miles back, he merely
remarked that it was “a bit o’ hard luck having to
go back that far for the blinded thing.”
“Kenbir” (Kendall Expedition) : We
picked Paddy up at Cooktown, his knowledge of the
district and his excellent qualifications as a bush-
man gaining him a prominent place in the expedi-
tion. He had the true Irishman’s horror of snakes,
and one night, while he was absent from camp with
Kendall, some of the men put a dead death-adder in
his bunk. On returning Paddy flung himself on the
bunk, but immediately leaped to his feet with a
wild yell, at the same time hurling the wriggler right
into the midst of his grinning mates. Imagine the
scatter when the would-be jokers found, not a death-
adder, but a very lively brown snake drop among
them. On the reptile being dispatched he was opened
up and the adder was found inside. It was a fine
lesson on the folly of leaving snake-food about the
bunks.
EQUALITY.
SCHNORRER: “Hullo, Abe, lend uth a quid.”
ABE ( lending him half-a-quid): “Here!”
SCHNORRER : “Ay, I tiled a quid.”
ABE: “Yeth, I know. You. looth half-a-
quid and I looth half-a-quid.”
“Minnehaha” : Like “L’Fou” (B. 12/7/’23),
I want to know how animals can tell Sun-
day from any other day. Someone suggested that
church-bells do the trick. As our case, in which the
animal is a canary, is out of bounds for church-bells,
that reason does not hold good. This feathered
warbler is kept in the bathroom at night, and every
morning, except on the Sabbath, it starts punctually
at 7 o’clock to serenade the bath-heater. On
Sunday mornings it, like its owner, takes an extra
hour’s snooze. No one in the house on any morning
of the week rises before the feathered alarm-clock
gives the tip. "
“H.K.”: Dampier may have been the first
white man to spot a kangaroo, as “Te Whare” says
(B. 14/6/’23), but Cook introduced the name to the
English language. In his diary he referred to the
big marsupial as “kanguroo.” Incidentally, the
spelling of the word appears to have been an
open question. Writing to Lord Nepean on July
10, 1788, Phillip had this to say: “The kangurroo
for your Lordship is the largest I have yet seen.
As it stands, it measures st't. Pin.” In subsequent
writings, however, Phillip spelt it in its present
form. Collins in his list of native names gives it
as “kangooroo,” while Tench states that the word
w,as unknown to the natives about the settlement.
“Kanguroo was a name unknown to them,” he
wrote, “for any animal, until wo introduced it.
When I showed Colbee (a native) the cow's brought
out in the Gorgon, he asked me if they w T ere kan-
guroos.”
LESSONS IN NATURAL
HISTORY.—CXVI.
THE STUDENT: “How can you tell draught-horses from, the other kind?”
THE PROFESSOR: “ Draught-horses wear beards on their ankles.”
“P. Le L.”: It was a wet clay, and my
mate and I were seated in the bush galley smoking,
when two galahs alighted on a tree about 50yds.
away'. The birds were facing us, square on, and
2ft. apart, when my mate fired at one of them. We
were surprised when both birds dropped to the
ground dead. We hurried over to investigate and
found that the .22 bullet had penetrated their
heads. Our coronial verdict on the tragedy was
that one of the birds must have crossed the line of
fire simultaneously with the bullet leaving the rifle.
Is this a fluke, or freak shot?
!jt K if #
“Skyrider”: “B’s” bullocks which swal-
lowed rocks (B. 28/6/’23) are by no means singular.
A cow killed at Eastgrove (N.S.W.), a year ago,
liAl even stranger tastes. Her stomach was found
to contain several pieces of bicycle chain, half a
pound of nails, two tobacco tins (ounce size), the
head of a small hammer and some pieces of
solder. She was in full milk until a week before
she was shot, and it was because she developed
strange symptoms that her owner decided to pass
her out. She had been grazing for a month on
clean grassland, and where she got the assortment
of ironmongery' was a my'stery.
* * * *
“Orion”: If it isn’t too late to butt into
the kangaroo-rat-paddy-melon controversy, I would
like to say that some of those replying (B.
5/7/’23) have confused the paddy-melon with a
smaller marsupial known as the flash-jack. This is
the pretty little creature, mentioned by “Nor’-West,”
that holds out its paw when hopping. I can’t
imagine any bushman mistaking a kangaroo-rat for
either a paddy-melon or a flash-jack. Color, shape,
size, in every way he is different, and, incidentally,
I believe the fastest thing on two legs for about 100
yards.
“Pat Bushie” : Despite “Primer” I agree
with “Blunder Buss” (B. 5/7/’23) that a .212 is
suitable for slaughtering cattle only when in a
very small yard, such as a butcher uses, and then
the shot must hit a vital part. On the North Coast
(N.S.W.) our family cow came to grief in calving.
Dad took the .22 rifle, and two longs were required
at close range to settle the animal. She moved
her head a fraction as the first shot was fired.
It was a bull calf, and we didn’t want it; but one
long and a bash on the head with a stick were
necessary before its alley went in.
* * * *
“Sierra”: I can back “Parama” up re
white men eating shark (B. 12/7/’23). I have
eaten portions of 12-footers myself; and among men
who had lived for any length of time on salt
tucker I never met one who didn’t welcome the
chance of getting his teeth into a sizzling shark-
steak. Cut from near the tail and fried in pork
fat the steaks made an appetising dish, and were
certainly more palatable and wholesome than the
salt junk served out to windjammer seamen a few
years ago. Also, I knew an old crayfisher who
frequently put shark on his menu although he had
all the fish of Bass Strait ’to choose from. He spat
with disgust at the idea of eating crayfish.
“Bare”: When “N’importe” (B. 28/6/’23)
quotes figures he falls with a dull thud. His
whippet has done 100yds. in 54sec., which works
out, if the speed were maintained, at 96 4-ssec. to
the mile. A horse carrying 9st. 21b. has covered
the mile in 93 l-ssec. On the figures the weight-
carrier beats the whippet by 654vds. In a contest
the difference would be thrice that. Again, the
horse, with Bst. 111 b. up, has run five furlongs in
55 3-ssec., which gives an average of 5 ]-18sec. per
100yds. as' against the poodle’s 54sec. The animal
that humps the weight wins again—by Byds. And
the neddy is not the speed king.
“B.ll.A.”: “Jim Dandy’s” oat is not the
only one to change its overcoat (B. 28/6/’23). Two
years ago a house in Linga (Vic.) caught fire, and
when the back wall collapsed, outwards, the house-
hold cat, a bright tortoiseshell, emerged from the
inferno and made for the nearest scrub. She was
subsequently found to be badly burned on the feet
and head, the ears being charred to such an extent
that they could be broken like pieces of burnt
leather. But the body' fur was not even scorched.
Two months later Torchy was completely white —
and so she is to-day. No; the ears didn’t grow
again.
* * * *
“Cooralco” : How’s this for a record? On
a station west of the Darling (N.S.W.) some jum-
bucks were shifted from a paddock owing to the
water giving out. Three months later two sheep
were found in the same paddock in a staggering
condition. The fences wdre in good condition, and
the only possible chance the sheep had of wetting
their whistles during the three months was by' the
aid of a little green feed. The incident suggests
that the wool-growers of the West will soon be
breeding a race of bleaters that will put both the
camel and the Abo. Council in the shade for
abstemiousness.
* * * *
“Sucre”: “Peter” (B. 5/7/’23) mentions
a fish that boarded with him for 15 years. In 1889
a cod-fish was hooked in the Condamine River at
Warwick (Q.). A brass disc with the date of
seizure was fastened to its tail with copper wire,
and Sir Cod went back to his spouse in the river.
Twenty-five years later a cocky at Leyburn, further
down the landed the same fish.
“Monaro” : “Ezekiah” (B. 24/5/’23), who
says the lady lyre-bird is more conceited than ner
husband, has never seen him on the “dancing beds,”
a stage a couple of inches high and several feet
across, constructed of pebbles, earth, leaves, etc.,
whereon the male performance is invariably staged.
Anyone who has seen him strutting up and down,
feathers spread to the best advantage, imitating
the myriad sounds of the bush, such as the peculiar
“chock, clock” of dray-wheels, the musical ring of
the crosscut and bird-calls galore, while a couple
of admiring hens look on, will have no doubt on this
point. The ability of the lyre-bird to imitate
sounds such as those mentioned (ever hear him crack
a stockwhip?) puts him on the top rung of the
world’s feathered mimics. The far-famed American
mocking-bird is limited to natural sounds, such as
other bird-calls. It is a pity that, owing to depre-
dations by the fox, lyre-birds are becoming so scarce.
Despite assertions in recent Bulletins, they can’t
be kept in captivity, as in a Zoo. In the Mansfield
(Vic.) ease mentioned, a gully of 600 acres was
netted. Could a Zoo spare 600 acres? The lyre-
bird lives on snails, slugs, land crustaceans, etc.,
and the difficulty of providing such food in sufficient
quantity is the bar.
* * * *
“Cinquante Neuvieme”: I enter this as
the closest chop on record. Ginger, of a well-
known Gippsland family of axemen, was standing
on two logs chopping a central piece, when the axe
in its swing cleaved the wood and, continuing on its
course between Ginger’s legs, stuck into his skull at
the back. A nasty' gash was the result; but that
was 20 years ago, and Ginger is still on deck.
“8.R.A.” : “Yuot’s” reference(B. 5/7/’23)
to the prolific brood mare Fanny Cook reminds me
that in this district (N.W. Victorian Mallee) there is
a mare w'ho was 26 years old last foaling, and she
had had, up till then, 17 foals. By her 15th birth-
day her family numbered 12, and she is in foal
again this year., The old matron is still going
strong, and can do a half-mile with the best of
the young bloods of the paddock. Her progeny
consists of every class from a 14-hands pony to a
good useful draught.
“Yarrum” : The butcher-bird is sudden at
snapping up its prey ; but the little blue kingfisher
can give him a long start at it. Once I saw a king-
fisher snap clean in halves a dragon-fly that was
crossing a pool at top (and that insect’s top is first
cousin to a streak of lightning). The fly was as
long as the bird, and half the carcase was carried
to the latter’s nest at a time. Incidentally it is very
difficult to find a kingfisher’s nest, as he has it well
under a bank, and drops into it from the roots of
an overhanging tree. When he leaves the nest he
shoots straight across the water, skimming it at
terrific speed. He is about ifle quickest thing alive
on the wing.
* * * *
“Quang”: Farmers at Dunmore, in the
Kiama (N.S.W.) district, have registered another
grievance against Brer Fox. Reynard has developed
a sweet tooth and now eats the sweet sorghum stalks,
held to be the sole property of Strawberry
and her kind. Poisoned meat will soon cease to be
an attraction to this new breed of vegetarian fox.
A * » *
“Country Bed” : What is the largest fox-
skin ever pegged out in Australia ? I saw one near
Elmore (Vic.) the other day which measured from
tip of nose to tip of tail, 4ft. 7in. ; across the
forequarters, 3ft. lin.; across the narrowest portion
on the flanks, I7in.
“N.P.L.” : How is this for quick loss in
sheep ? One of the largest sheep-dealing cos. in the
Commonwealth had imported a prize ram at a cost
of 1500 guineas. The first lamb dropped had a
black spot on its back. The manager of the station
immediately went out and cut the ram’s throat.
“Trevdee”: Will the push-bike ever sup-
plant the horse on sheep- or cattle-runs? In parts of
Westralia it has already happened. One big station
north of Kalgoorlie still has a horse or two, but
all the stockmen use well-oiled push-bikes, and
prefer them to horses. “They don’t buck, stumble,
shy or eat tucker; you can catch ’em any time and
take ’em anywhere, and they’ll last longer,” is the
boast of the station boss, , At Newmarket yards
(Vic.) some of the sheep-drovers are using bikes—
but no one has tried ’em behind cattle yet.
LIZZIE WASN’T THAT SORT.
“Now, then, you were doing more than fifteen
miles an hour, you know.”
“Oh, go ’ way — flatterer!”
“James B.” looks back a few years:—
Re “Yarrum” (B. 7/6/’23) and the mysterious
drying up of Lake George (N.S.W.). I know the
lake well, having beejn born on its shores nearly
70 years ago. I have seen it bone dry, and have
also seen it a noble sheet of water 100 miles round
and 25 to 30 feet deep in many places. My father
has told me that it was dry' from 1839 till 1852,
and was filled at the time of the Gundagai flood.
In the ’sixties the water became so shallow that
one could walk almost all over it. In the wet
seasons of the ’seventies the water spread over a
lot of country which white people had never seen
submerged before. Whole farms were covered to a
depth of many' feet, and houses, barns and other
buildings were washed piecemeal to the shore. I
sailed a boat year after year above land w'here as a
boy I had toiled in the harvest field. The lake
drains an area of about 400 sq. miles; the four
main streams that feed it are raging torrents in
flood-time and mere chains of waterholes in drought.
After flowing into the lake the water soon becomes
so brackish as to be undrinkable by man, though
it is much relished by stock. There is nothing
mysterious about the drying up of the lake, any
more than there is in a 1 vessel becoming
empty when w'ater is constantly going out and none
coming in. Over this large body of comparatively
shallow 7 water evaporation is very great—the shal-
lower the water becomes the greater the evaporation.
There is no need for an underground channel. The
water goes upward, not downward. When the lake
was dry there was no of “Yarrum’s”
underground river. Possibly lie and his mates heard
a train rumbling in the distance. His knowledge
of the district seems to be rather vague, for iie
speaks of “Milbank, near Bungendore.” Mil-
bank is at the other end of the lake, near Collector.
Incidentally, what I should like a scientist’s opinion
on are the reirfarkable stone walls on the edge
of the lake at a place locally known as Stonewall
Point. From 50 to 150 feet long, 20 to 30 feet high
and about 4ft. thick, with sides as even as if laid
bv a mason, they are a striking feature; and how
they were formed (for, of course, they weren’t built)
is a very interesting problem.
DIRRANBANDI.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“Influenza is very prevalent at Dirranbandi. Half
the population is stated to be ill, and one death has
been reported.”
O Temp., O Mores! When I knew
The sunlit glades of Dirranbandi,
There raged no devastating ’flu
To knock the population bandy.
One pub in simple beauty grew,
Which served the safe, refreshing shandy ;
Though wearers of the ribbon blue
Might seek the river, cool and handy—■
As often did the reckless crew
Who’d quenched their thirst with local “brandy.”
There was a small post-office, too,
And, on its welcoming “verandy,”
Was sometimes seen the jackeroo,
The local cattle-duffing dandy,
With swagmen and a “gun” or two,
Or p’rhaps a pompous squatter grandee.
Ah, foolish Youth ! Too late we knew
The world a bitter hashmagandy
Of Dead Sea fruit, whose cunning hue
Disguised a diet harsh and sandy.
Too late, too late, we’d fain renew
The simple life of Dirranbandi !

The Bushland into which Sydney Town
Hall changed for what masqueraded as the
Artists’ Ball seemed as though it had come
straight from the hands of the interior deco-
rator : it had that swept and garnished look,
and flowered overhead in a forest of balloons
—-Suburbia’s unfailing sign of carnival. The
pillars of the gallery were dressed to repre-
sent gum-trees, from whose glowing green
head-dress native birds and beasts peered
with eyes of suspicion. The lighting was a
triumph, mellowed to the evenness of sun-
light. Artist Minns had let a tribe of his abos.
loose among the vegetation; but, on the
whole, the designers had excluded that touch
of nature which makes the whole world kin.
Not even the most reckless artist had had
the temerity to resurrect the Kelly gang—
probably, this being a respectable Artists’
Ball, no Kelly without a water-front address
could hope for admission.
There were 1500 dancers, many of them
attracted by the memory of the previous
frivol; but this year the evening was as full
of yawns as last year it was of laughter.
Nearly half the crowd was in “formals,” and
of the others many hid their years in wigs
and revealed them in hose-clad shanks. Most
of the women disguised themselves as ladies
behind more or less historically-correct cos-
tumes and head-dresses. There were “ladies”
of every period, broidered and stomachered,
braided and curled. The period costumes
were not all a success from the onlooker’s
point of view. They swamped the wearers’
curves and lines; two striking exceptions to
this were Mrs. Alexander Gordon and Mrs.
Bertie Kelly, both with stage experi-
ence to help them. Mrs. Gordon, in her wine-
colored velvets and pearls, was exquisite as
the tiny Claude of France; and Mrs. Kelly,
as the famous Blue Pompadour, carried her
blue and lavender with an air. Mrs. Clive
Hangar, as the stately Katharine of Aragon,
V-'ttt , “ore inexplicable than ever Henry
Mil. s devotion to the divorce court. Mrs.
r.dmund Playfair trailed the biscuit magni-
ficence of another Pompadour. Bertie Kelly
was a Cardinal Wolsey in a crimson-and-
white lace rig-out that looked as though it
might have been Archbishop Kelly’s; but the
only, splash of brilliance about liis eldest
cluck, Beatrice, was her own beautiful Titian
hair. _ A Sheldon girl carried off a prize for
a Gamsborough demonstration in millinery,
while na and ma beamed from the vice-regal
coop m the gallery, where the G.-G. Forster
couple, she in a sequined frock that glittered
i 6 moonlight, were supported by some
bored-looking aides and an ermine-enfolded
Bady Patricia Blackwood. And Tommy
Cochran was over from Melbourne.
In between dances the sets posed against a
black velvet background. The best carried-
out was the one arranged by Mr. Dulieu and
Mrs. Alexander Gordon, and represented the
entente between Francis I. and Henry VIII
on that historic allotment (splendid build-
ing site gravel sub-soil—southerly aspect)
known as the Field of the Cloth of Gold ; but
the : se_t that got the loudest hand was the
charming blue Wedgwood. Theo Cowan’s
I ottery took the eye; the sculptor her-
self wore the black velvet and white
mob can of Vigee Je Brun. The Con-
suiar Segaerts came, he as a black-
bearded Rubens, and daughter Ilenriette wore
a high tortoishell comb, wrapped a lace scarf
about her head and called herself a Senorita.
Mrs._ Beaton had the violet velvets of an
old-time Isabella, and Ruby Adams the
blue brocades of the Fifth ' Henry’s wife.
C;fe. Consul Moseley wore the Mayflower
millinery of Miles Standish; John Moore as
a Buttercup, Leon Gelert as George Lam-
bert, and Lambert as the
Khayyam; Norman Lindsay’s tall wife in
a medieval costume designed by Norman:
Ihea Proctor, in white book muslin, bustled
and puffed and circular-trained, and convey-
ing the suggestion of Gothic architecture;
and surgeon McKelvey’s lady as a pink
satin Gainsborough—these were among the
splashes of color that moved in and out
of the tapestry. Sydney Ure Smith, black
satm-breeclied and white ruffled, made his le<-
to the vice-regals early and took his depart
ture; but Albert Collins, in ruby-red robes
and an Oscar Asche make-up, stayed to the
last to keep the bridge— at any rate, he tried
to keep the decorations when some of the
really naice and elusive guests ripped them
down from the walls and made for their
family Rolls Royces with the cartoons under
their arms.
But no eyebrows were lifted as high over
that as over the appearance of Mrs. Sep
Bevy as a nun. It shows how tolerant or
something this generation is when a leader
or the Jewish community is ready to wear
the uniform of one who has dedicated her-
self to the Cross.
The Egyptian Ball, arranged in the in-
terests of the Girl Guides and Boy Scouts,
cheered up the opening night of a dull week.
Mrs. Albert Littlejohn, who had secretaried
the bail, can flaunt; a whole ostrich-farm of
plumes over its success. Besides the thou-
sand odd-dancers there were over 400 lookers-
®. n *. Bart of the Gyppo scenic display was a
living frieze, led off by a group of Boy
Scouts, dyed to the line of Abyssinian slaves,
drawing a gilt chariot with the Davidson
children seated and Mrs. Venour Nathan in
the forefront—she encased in gold, as thin
as a rapier in a Damascus scabbard. The
chariot was followed by Egyptian ladies,
evidently in reduced circumstances, for as
they moved they thrust out the right hand
imploring baksheesh, while the left shot be-
at a distressed angle, equally insistent.
Their silent appeal won Dam e Margaret’s
special prize. The most graceful set was
the water-carriers, in white draperies, glow-
mg red pitchers on their shoulders. Mrs.
A. E. Hughes was one of the stunning-looking
matrons ; and Mrs. M. 11.I 1 . Dalton was another
belle at Ptolemy’s Court. There were
flower-girls, fan-bearers and harpists who
looked as though they were entering for an
archery prize; and fruit-sellers who looked
as luscious as their wares. Dame Margaret,
as Chief Girl Scout, came in ivory brocades;
and the Chief Justice’s lady was of the party
in a graceful swathing of black tulle.
Does Shaw appeal more to woman’s sense
of humor than to man’s? The other after-
noon, when “Pygmalion” was the attraction
of the Violet Matinee, the ecstatic giggles
of the women had very little support from
the male chorus. Perhaps it is only that the
Australian male with time to attend matinees
hasn’t much understanding of humor, Shaw’s
or anyone else’s. But, anyway, the afternoon
was a success. The dress-circle was filled
at a guinea a seat. Two boxes had been
bought at £5O each by J. J. Garvan and
S Sam Hordern’s lady. Platoons of girls
behind trays of violets and sweets, under the
generalship of Eadith Walker and Mrs. Ken
Richards, held up an unresisting audience;
and Sydney Ure Smith’s programmes were
sold at nothing less than a shilling. Alto-
gether the Children’s Hospital should have
had a splendid catch. Society cain e in
legion, bursting to pay its guineas to hear a
G.-G. s daughter use the sanguinary ad jet
tive which has earned many a drunk £24
hours. The only one in the audience who
bore a pained expression was xMonty Severn,
though Mrs. Monty took it is debonairely as
the next. In the interval Annette Kellerman
flashed before the curtain like a mauve-and-
gold butterfly with emerald tracings, and
auctioned a doll she had dressed as the poster
for her new film, “The Darling of the Deep.”
H brought £ll 10s.. and a troupe of violet
' devils” went at a pound apiece. Annette
started off by asking a modest crown, but
the Waley lady from a box sent the price
to £1 and nobody seemed to mind. A quaint
telephone doll given by florist Stella Fawcett
fell to Mrs. Clive Hangar at £l2 12s. Mrs.
Arthur Rickard bought a cradle of violets
for another 10 guineas, and somebody gave
three guineas for a box of chocolates'. The
G.-G. and Lady Forster viewed their talented
daughter’s success from one box, while Dame
Margaret applauded from another. Mrs.
Alfred Turnbull, who wangled £l3O for pro-
gramme advertisements, deserves honorable
mention.
Glen Broughton’s picture of Monica Scully
shows you that rare bird in Sydney—a pro-
fessional entertainer in private homes. Her
songs at the
piano and
d r a m a tie
-■•ketches have
become a fea-
ture of big re-
ceptions. Mon-
ica first at-
tracted no-
tices for her
elocu tfionary
wo r k when
she was a
pupil of Monte
St. Angelo.
Since then she
has appeared
with Emelie
Polini in “The
Eyes of
Youth,” and
has been well
cast in most
of the Recent
R e pertory
plays. With her two sisters, Bessie and
r lances, she has been responsible for organ-
ising- kiddies entertainments in aid of
almost every Sydney charity.
rr d , el ' T^ he srey cowl of Monday’s sky
Twilight House stood pensively watching the
visitors from that world of active middle-age
and youth from which its own inhabitants
nave withdrawn through stress of time and
circumstance. For the guests of Twilight
House ave elderly gentlewomen with whom
the world has gone awry; and the house
with its bright surroundings is their sanc-
tuary. Not a large enough one, said Mr. Innes-
Noad at the meeting on Monday, over which
Lady Forster presided. So the committee
has decided to build a sister house at Bee-
croft, the idea being that the guests may
transfer from one to the other if health
demands. Already many of the rooms have
been furnished (in cheques) by sym-
pathisers ; and the most touching testimony
to their own happiness in their surround-
ings was given by the guests at Twilight
House when they offered to arrange a sale
of work to raise funds to furnish at least
one room in the sister home.
Turn up the letters from any of your
American millionaire correspondents, and
you will find a simple initial introducing the
rolling thunder of a second Christian name
before the hushed glory of the surname.
The new sculptor at the Technical College
is like that, too—G. Rayner Hoff. Not
that Mr. Hoff was born under the Spreading
Eagle. Mr. Hoff comes from Nottingham,
and at 28 has a dazzling list of distinctions
and medals, including the Rome scholar-
ship for sculpture open to British-born
artists. The young man gives an impression
of enormous vitality, and of modesty to equal
it. His hair is black, with a kink in it,
and his eyes are yellow brown. At the
gathering of artists and architects to wel-
come him, Mrs. Hoff (of course, there’s a
catch in it) wore English tailorings that
matched her clever husband’s eyes, and threw
up the pink English roses in her own cheeks.
There were cakes carved in the Tech, kitchen
for refreshment. But only two convicted
sculptors among the welcomers—Theo
Cowan and Miss Benson.
This is Freeman and Co.’s picture of the
extraordinary man who thinks he is too old
for the Leg. Council, and, therefore, resigned
last week. For
over 50 years
Henry Moses
has been in
P a r 1 i a ment,
and nearly 40
of them have
been spent in
the Council:
last session,
though he was
then 90, he
made 21 ap-
pearances in
the House,
and that's
more than
twice as many
as 15 other
members made.
Men, of course,
know how to
manage these
things; but a
woman in her
folly would ask, “Here’s a man who proved
lnmself a sound business head half-a-
-c-entury ago, and has helped to build some
of the most prosperous concerns in the State;
why in all his 50 years in politics hasn’t he
once been in the country’s Executive?”
There is a second and a third generation of
the family: son Harry has filled the public
eye oftenest in the days when he was first
a cricket and then a bowling champion : and
the name is honored wherever horse dukes
and duchesses are known in Australia.
Although the Bush Book Club picked on
the wettest day of the week for its yearly
at-home, hundreds of people walked up the
stairs and across the roof to the club’s funny
little eyrie above Castlereagh-street. And
everybody who came brought a book, so that
late in the afternoon secretary Beulah Bol-
ton and the committee had rather a job to
keep their heads above the Seas of Litera-
ture. The two vice-regals dropped in with
their offerings, but the limousines didn’t
collide, for Dame Margaret came in time for
11 o’clock tea, and Lady Forster looked in
on the 4 o’clock brew. Captain Lawrence
aided the Governor-General’s lady, who was
entrenched in chinchilla and blue cloth.
One of the week’s pretty weddings took
place at St. Stephen’s on Thursday, Jean
Robson, of Vaucluse, confiding her life-long
trust in James McGibbon MeLaurin, of
Dalriada, Holbrook. Honiton lace over white
satin worn with a veil of Honiton enwrapped
the bride, who was escorted to the altar-
rails by father. Three bridesmaids in pale
blue and silver, their blue veils bound across
the forehead with bands of silver leaves, fol-
lowed the bride and her Juliet-capped train-
bearer. Two brothers and a cousin of the
’groom completed the group. The cake was
cut at the Wentworth, where bride’s mother
and father entertained nearly 200 guests,
mostly from the country and other States.
Sylvia Street and Geoffrey Love, promi-
nent members of the Petersham Choral
Society, had a wedding recently at St.
James’s. Later the bride’s parents enter-
tained over a hundred guests at the Dispen-
sary Hall, Leichhardt. In giving “Bride and
Bridegroom,” W. LI. Gibson referred slyly
to the large number of marriages that had
taken place in the Petersham society. The
Love pair left for England by the Mongolia,
and will be absent from Australia for about
three years; most of the time will be spent
in Italy, where the male bird will be on busi-
ness for his firm.
Hilda Beale, a dark-haired, slim daughter
ot the Australian piano-maker, has become
engaged to Reg Ramble, of Stratlifield lie,
is an ex-A.LF-er, and Hilda did her bit
as a war-worker. The matrimonial duet will
be composed in the last lap of the year.
Congratulations upon her hundredth birth-
day tell gently upon Mrs. Margaret Fal-
coner, of Stanmore, the other day. She came
to Australia 70 years ago; and when the
railway to Parramatta was opened her hus-
band was made stationmaster at HomebusL.
i children alive, 40 grand-
children and numerous progeny in the fourth

A wreath from the Blinded Soldiers’ Asso-
ciation was the tribute which the spirit of
krancis Clare surely appreciated most.
V\ hen Fritz made his bad guess Mrs. Clare
a ?l. hand at Poking after the comforts
ot soldiers—she had been engaged in like
work during the Zulu and Boer wars, besides
various minor affairs. She was working for
one of her numerous voluntary societies only
the day before she died.
Zora Cross has had a novel accepted by
Hutchinson’s. It’s the one that ran as a
serial through the Australasian, and the
publishing firm claims the writer’s next two.

Miss Pembroke, of Yass, has just com-
pleted her 50th year as librarian of the local
Mechanics Institute. The townspeople
marked the occasion by giving her a cheque
to buy herself a well-deserved holiday.
The Rose Ball in aid of the Mount St.
Margaret Hospital at Ilyde promises to be
one of the pretty functions of next month.
It s to be roses all the way; and the Pad-
dington Town Hall will be the bower. Molly
Relly, of Ryde, again secretaries the venture.
Don’t forget Lee White’s matinee to-day at
the Royal for the babies of St. Margaret’s.
The Hospice for the Dying at Darling-
sent out an SOS, and immediately its
old friends rallied round. To raise funds
it was decided to arrange a ball to be held
m August. Mrs. W. E. Ward is president
ot the committee.
A Brisbane postscript:—-
Doctors of Divinity, Doctors of Law, Doctors of
Science and just plain Intellectuals rolled up in
battalions to hear Prof. Mackail give his opinion of
the trend and ultimate goal of modern poetry. Sir
Matthew, in the splendid gold-banded robes of Chan-
cellor of the Uni., listened comfortably after his
own charming- little preliminary canter down the
straight. The Mackail wife and child and Girl Guide
Prior were in a group ; and Cumbrae Stewart, with
his scarlet cape, and professors in gowns adorned
with yellow and green and red made the place look
like a dynamited rainbow. Most of the women were
hatted and coated, but a few wore the bare neck
of evening habit. Among them were Mrs. Cumbrae
Stewart, Mrs. Hassell, Mrs. P. J. Symes, the George
Lssex Evans widow, Mrs. Forrest and daughter,
Lylie Stevenson, Alice Gore Jones, and ma ny mortar-
boarded Uni. girl-graduates, with a sprinkling of
male adherents.
His Ex. tore up the North Coast line to open one
show at Nambour, then away on to the main line next
day to declare the Rosewood show well and truly
laid. At present Sir Matt, is entertaining the Mac-
kails, Margaret Prior and ex-sec. Giles at Govern-
ment House, and is making ready to take in Ethel
Campbell when she signals. The Returned Soldiers'
League are busy on the Durban Angel’s behalf, and
Mis. 1 orrest has written an ode of welcome to be
recited at the Exhibition on August 9.
On the same night Stella Power carolled in the
Exhibition Concert Hall, under a jewelled head-dress
and in a Paris frock of tangerine with a perfect
Chu-Chin-Chow-colored cloak, whose peacock hues had
tassels to keep them down. Sweet peas, gerberas and
much applause were hurled in her direction.
Both the Motor-yacht Club and the R. Q. Yacht
Club scored jazzing successes with their balls. At the
R.Q.Y. shivoo Commodore and Miss Love, Mary Mac-
donald of the long eyelashes, and the Walter Mactag-
garts were features of the landscape. Another sparkling
affair was the ball hostessed by Sheila Mcßryde in the
lounge at Montpelier. Sheila, who was in powder-
blue with a posy of pink at her 18th-century waist,
had the assistance of her mother in black jet, and
among those who came along were some officers from
the French warship.
Dr. and Mrs. Windsor fed some friends at the
Hotel Brisbane and then took their party (which
included Premier Theodore and his wife, the Barring-
ton Waterses and some medical gentlemen) to clap
“Sally’s” terpsichorean feats at His Majesty’s. “Sally”
is booming.
A few days hence there will be a quiet little
wedding at Cooehin station, when Victor Bell will
slip a gold band on the waiting finger of Gwenda
Campbell-Riley.
Sir Matthew gave luncheon the other day to the
Commandante, Lieut. Maseten and Ensign Robert,
of the French warship, our Captain Hyde, Com-
mander Mutton, Major and Mrs. Carter, Mrs. Bruche
and several of Brisbane’s naicest girls.
The Diggers handed some solid silver vases to
Matron Waller, of Rakeevan, on her retirement from
the job she has held there for close on four years.
Grateful remarks accompanied the gift, and a make-
weight in the shape of a luminous-dialed clock was
added by the V.A.D.’s.

No,
Heavier Oil can never replace Metal worn away!
You are sometimes advised to
use a heavier oil as your engine
becomes worn. Heavier oil, some
people will tell you, provides a bet-
ter seal for clearances enlarged
through wear.
But first consider these facts: —
As your car grows older, metal is
worn away by the wear between mov-
ing surfaces. Will heavier oil replace
this lost metal? No.
The oiling system of your engine
was designed specifically to circulate
Lubricating Oil of a certain body.
Will this oiling system—pump, screen
oil pipes, etc.—distribute effectively a
heavier oil? No.
Any oil, whether heavy or light,
when used in worn engines, will work
past the pistons and piston rings and
enter the combustion chambers, form-
ing carbon. The heavier the oil, the
more aggravated will usually be the
carbon deposit.
What are the wise and only proper
measures to take when your engine is
badly worn? Obviously, have the
bearings adjusted, have new pistons
and piston rings fitted and continue to
use the correct grade of oil for which
your engine and oiling system were
designed.
The correct oil for your car —dur-
ing its entire life —is specified by the
Gargoyle Miobiloil Chart of Recom-
mendations.
Worn Rings Cause Carbon Deposits
Worn piston rings move
perceptibly upward on the
down stroke of the piston;
the oil accumulates
and behind the rings/
Then as the piston moves,
upward the rings move to
Mobiloil
the .dart youryuidg
the bottom of the recess,
forcing the oil by the rings.
This is sometimes termed
“oil pumping.’* The oil
ultimately reaches the
.combustion chamber, ca»*“-
mg carbon deposit.

The Wattle tearooms were packed the
other night for a card-party on behalf of
Queen Victoria Hospital. The rooms had
been effectively dolled up, and the entrance
hall was a spectacularly set bazaar in which
a roaring trade was done in sweets and
fancy trifles. Girl brigands disguised as
black-and-white Pierrettes also made a fine
haul. As hon. secs., the Tallis dame, in
soft Oriental hangings, and Adelaide Allan,
in black georgette, buzzed round like twin
bees. The poker and bridge enthusiasts
didn’t have it all their own way, for several
groups worshipped at the time-worn shrine
of “crib.” Young things jazzed on the Palm
Court tiles, with an interval off when songs
from Bobby Chisholm and Cecil Bradley were
listened to via wireless—after which no one
wondered at Dame Nellie’s fierce objection to
having her golden notes diluted by radio.
Mrs; 1 W. M. Robins flew golden sunbursts
from her inky dress, and Mrs. Ham, who
hal lent the rooms and supplied the supper,
smiled prettily under misty black. Mrs.
Cabena, the hospital president, intersected
her black brocade with silver. The A. E. V.
Hiskenses dropped in to see how things were
going; the Bertie Austins were there, also
the Frank Taits ; Fred Knight had a bridge
four; Alec Isaacson wandered round with
a group of pals; and Mrs. J. J. Johnson
brought daughter Verna.
To-morrow tennis-player Pat O’Hara
Wood starts a doubles partnership for good
with his old playmate, Mrs. Lister.' The
romance, which has been simmering for some
time, has been deepened by tender collusion
on the tennis court. Spectators who have
watched them closely in action have noticed
a mutual solicitude, and if there were any
doubt on the matter one look at the swain's
face when his divinity was going down to
the punching drives of Esna Boyd would
convince anybody of the state of his heart.
The wedding is to be very quiet—in fact,
the Voice that Breathes will almost have to
apologise for its respiration.
And while Mrs. Lister has been thinking
of matrimony her sister, Darthea, has not
only thought about it, but actually taken
the plunge. She lately crossed to America
with her trained-nurse’s certificate in her
bag, and has now sent word that she. has
tied up with a fellow-passenger, Douglas
Faires. He is convoying her back next
month to settle in Sydney.
The grannies of East Melbourne have a
sentimental grievance against either the
curator of Fitzroy Gardens or the Municipal
Council, which lays down laws for the south-
ern border of that verdant trysting-ground.
The Moreton Bay fig-trees are under sen-
tence of death—in fact, they have already
begun to shed their heart’s blood. As im-
poverishers of the adjacent garden-beds and
disturbers of peaceful footpaths, they were
nuisances; so they had to go. They were
younger, and comparatively harmless, when
women wore bonnets and young fellows re-
joiced in belltoppers on the Sabbath Day.
Early fathers and mothers of the district re-
member when they stood under those More-
ton Bays for—well, for whatever the early
fathers and mothers did. One of the trees
was even dear to the memory of a respected
dame on account of her having tripped over
its protruding roots on the very night dear
James proposed to her, and she told him to
give her a year to make up her mind.
Bishop Cranswick, of Gippsland, has been
having a troublous time. First his wife was
capsized from a buggy, and injury and shock
put her out of action for some months. Then
the Gaiters themselves were struck by a
succession of carbuncles. Despite medical
advice, he kept to his work—and paid for
it later by a protracted laying-up. How-
ever, he has so far recovered that now he is
able to get about his big diocese in the Aus-
tralian Alps once more.
If families like Premier Lawson’s were the
rule there would be less need to talk immi-
gration. All Castlemaine flocked to the local
station, with a band, to met him the day
he came home, and after he had acknow-
ledged briefly the greeting, he said he must
hurry home to call the roll. He had waiting
there four bonny lads and as many lasses,
and for many days lie had been picturing the
delight of the reunion. That opened the
ranks of the crowd like magic.
The first annual meeting of the South
Yarra Tennis Club was wild and wuzzy.
One section of the packed house had come
with the do-or-die determination to inject
fresh blood into the committee; the other
lot with the equally stubborn intention of
keeping it out. The more timid of the
pettieoated members blanched under the
fierceness of the verbal fife. Solicitors Jack
McComas and Frank Dobson were in the van
of the attackers, and when a show of hands
was called for ther defenders were routed. An
awful calm set in when one strong-minded
female, having lighted on one of the advisory
voting-papers circulated among the re-
formers, bore the offending document to the
Chair to hotly demand what should be done
to the author of this pretty thing; but the
calm rippled to a chorus of titters when
president Norman Brookes* instead of sug-
gesting boiling oil, coolly advised the lady
to tear it un. The reform party got all its
new members elected, and now the enlarged
committee will prospect the situation and
if possible rope in a bit of land handy to the
courts. Among the newly elected are
Norman Clapperton, Tim Clapp and W. But-
ler ; but H. H. Haynes, who has a record of
great work, remains hon. sec. on a unanimous
vote.
Norman Clapperton, who now becomes the
lion. treasurer of the club, is the
father of that bright young flapper Audrey,
who plays in the schoolgirl champion class.
His elder girl, Rose, is also one of the cracks.
The family came down from their N.S.W.
slieeprun a few years back to settle in
Malvern.
The new meat supervision regulations de-
clare that sheep shall not be dressed up to
make the mutton look like lamb. What, then,
is to become of the beauty parlors?
Archibald Iloadley, principal of Footseray
Technical School and geologist with Maw-
son’s Antarctic expedition, who is to marry
Evelyn Scotney in December, belongs to the
family whose maternal home is at Kew.
Brothers Walter and P.B. are directors of
Hoadley’s Chocolates, Ltd., and the Federal
Milk Co., while younger brother A.E., who
married a daughter of Powers, J., is in
charge of the advertising and distributing
departments of the chocolate firm. He has
a bevy of tall, good-looking sisters, one of
whom married David Christie, of Y.M.C
fame, while the youngest, who has artistic
leanings, is the wife of Carlyle Adamson, an
E., S. and A. Bank manager and frequent
contributor to banking journals.
Eileen Pascoe-Webbe, pictured herewith,
is a North Fitzroy girl with a pure-toned
contralto of extra size and quality. Teacher
Bartleman, its tutor from its infancy, is still
training it.
The melodious
lass has done
a fair amount
of concert
work, but her
biggest effort
thus far was
made in the
Philharmonic
Society’s Eas-
ter production
of “Elijah,”
and her voice
attracted spe-
cial attention
at Bartleman's
recital in
June. Eileen
has made a
habit of prize-
winning since
she wore short
petticoats, and
included in the
scalps in her wigwam are a number of tro-
phies bagged at Launceston competitions.
Bea Laidlaw gave her home town, Hamil-
a miss. She consented to meet Jack
McKeller at the Collins-street Scots’ altar
last week. Like many another bride since
Princess Betty walked into the Abbey in a
silvery moonbeam fabric, Bea had electro-
plated herself under silver lace, and sug-
gested a Joan of Arc in chain-armor. A
glittering paste girdle encircled the square-
cut coat of mail, and a smaller rope, sprout-
ing orange blossoms, anchored the pearl-
hemmed bridal tulle which floated over a
back-wash of silver lace. Cousin Vera Arm-
strong and a Ma-State damsel, Ruth Sanger,
’maided prettily in pinky velvet, sashed with
silver lace under rosy mantles of tulle, parted
down the middle with more silver lace, and
clamped to the head with silver bandages.
Tiny Elswyn Laidlaw and Una McKeller,
nieces of the bride and ’groom, dimpled joy-
ously as miniature editions of their elders’
pinkiness. Don Moffatt had Angus Urquhart
to help him guard the ’groom. After the
Wedding March _ the T. H. Laidlaws staged
the usual cheerio at No. 9 Darling-street.
There the bride’s mother, in black-jetted
chiffon, welcomed half the woolly Western
District. The newly-weds will live on the
family sheep-run, Kirkella, near Stawell,
which the late squatter Duncan McKeller
handed on to his only boy. It will be remem-
bered that Duncan McKeller’s widow, who
afterwards married Dr. Dunhill, was an
Affleck.
Just when his services were most needed
Frank Johnstone, assistant sec. of the Vic.
Labor Bureau, has gone out to pneumonia.
For years he handled the unemployed with
impartiality and humanity, and got so inter-
ested in his work that he let others elbow
their way to the front of him in the service.
At 64 he was still a third-class officer, and
now nine months’ pay (something under
£300) is _ all his widow can expect. His
pension rights die with him.
This is Mostyn Wright, a young surveyor,
who looms large in amateur mumming gen-
erally and in Repertory, Mermaid and Shaks-
peare Society
circles in par-
ticular. He is
now adventur-
ing more am-
bitiously as a
p 1 a y wrig h,
and at the re-
quest of the
heads of the
Institute of
Arts will pro-
duce one of
his own crea-
tions in the
Queen’s Hail
on August 9.
Critics who
have sat ill
judgment on
the effort, “A
Margin for
Errofl,” have
declared it to
be cleverly con-
st nich'd on original foundations, or words
to that effect. Wright, who is a native of
Melbourne, is rather bookish, and carries a
fair French accent w’hich he keeps in good
repair by dropping in at Alliance Frangaise
meetings.
S. de Tarczynski, the Polish violinist,
identifiable by his flaxen crop, has just added
a baby girl to his family of two small, wide-
eyed sons, who are following in poppa’s foot-
steps—one plays the piano, the other
struggles with a diminutive violin. Mamma’s
contribution to the family cleverness is a
flair for languages. She can argue with the
gasman in eight, including Arabic. Perhaps
the newcomer will have a Voice.
Colin Colahan, erstwhile pupil of Max
Meldrum, has removed himself, his wife and
his brushes to Paris. They have a studio
in the picturesque Boulevard de Clichy, and,
judging by their letters, have discovered the
meaning of “earthly paradise.”
The French Government has just be-
stowed on Mrs. James Dyer the rank of
Officier cTlnstruction Publique as a reward
for what she has done for French art and
literature in her role of president of the
Alliance Frangaise here. She deserves the
honor, not alone for her artistic qualities,
but for the ever-helpful hand she extends
to struggling musicians. The kindly matron
is herself a brilliant pianiste, and has several
R.C.M. diplomas in her treasure-box. Pro-
bably the splendiferous frivols spread by the
Dyers for the visiting French squadron some
months back helped to inspire the award.
The George Eddington widow died last
w’eek at her Toorak home after putting up
a long and plucky fight against heart dis-
ease. _ She was a Melbourne girl, Constance
Morris, sister-in-law of the lovely Mrs. Maes-
more, but most of her married years were
spent in the Brisbane sunshine, where her
big husband earned his crust by banking. As
girl and matron everyone liked her. The
one Eddington offspring is the wife of naval
Dr. Carr, who lately left the Jervis Bay
College to join the medical staff of the Rand-
w’ick Hospital; and the Carrs’ four-year-old
chick, Alison, had been sheltering with her
adoring grandma for some weeks before the
latter’s death.
As president of the Old Ormond Students’
Association, General “Pompey” Elliott, with
the help of his popular little wife, ran an
at-home on Saturday afternoon at Menzies’.
Over a hundred Old Ormondians —with wives,
if any and willing—gathered in the big
downstairs reception chamber, which sprouted
gum leaves, yellow poppies, a stringed orches-
tra and tea-tables in full bearing. Mrs.
Pompey shouldered brown furs over her grey,
and smiled under a brown inverted hatbriin
supporting a single pink rose. The master
of Ormond was there with Mrs. Picken, who
was brown-frocked under a grey velvet toque.
Other ’Varsity lights were Father Murphy,
the Newman College head, and the Warden of
Trinity and Mrs. Behan (she in brown with
gold roses round her hat-crown). Justice
Schutt, immaculately tailored, as usual, came
alone —he is a grass-widower while his wife
tones herself up with a tonic of Queensland
sunshine after a bad bout with ’flu. Medical
Col. Downes, who has taken six months off
his Caulfield Hospital duties to compile a
book of the war, was with a group of old
Collegians. Senator Drake-Brockman con-
voyed his feminine half, and the Ministerial
Littleton Groom was sighted living his old
Ormond days again with some of the boys.
Mrs. Grattan Grey, who died at Jolimont
the other day, was a kinswoman of Charlotte
Bronte and was something of a writer her-
self. Her mother’s parents were with the
first batch of people who arrived to settle
Melbourne.
Lorna Pounds has dipped her bird-of-
paradise lid in obedience to the Common-
wealth law, which says thou shalt not dis-
play these forbidden plumes. She has packed
them away in a sealed tin to wait till called
for. The bird, it appears, isn’t the London
edition of that special “Rockets” head-
decoration, but was dear grandma’s, and was
retrieved on Lorna’s return to her native
gum-trees.
Max Meldrum has just finished a copy of
his “Sweet Peas” for the Ballarat Gallery.
He is a familiar figure at Eltham nowadays,
painting landscapes for an exhibition in the
Spring.
Mrs. Ainslie Mills’s 18-year-old girl Peggy,
lately, somehow’, somewhere, bruised a small
bone in her back. Although the injury is not
listed as serious, she has been forced'to caii
off all tennis find jazz fixtures, and has to lie
flat fintil the hurt bone feels itself again.
The Best flappers wailed at the horrid news,
for pretty Peggy is a most popular member
of Toorak’s younger set.
Nothing in particular was being done in
the kitchen, when an apologetic mistress
drifted in, carrying a new rat-trap. “Annie,”
said the dame of the place, “you have been
complaining of a rat in the kitchen. If
you’ll set this trap you’ll probably catch it
to-night.” Annie looked at the representa-
tive of capitalism icily. “If you think I
am going to set rat-traps oh the wages I
am getting,” she said, “you are very much
mistaken.”
W. R. Barstow, Sergeant-at-Arms in the
Assembly, is one of the two or three surviv-
ing officials who retain vivid memories of the
departure of the mace from Parliament
Llouse in 1891. Barstow was then a minor
messenger, and he and others searched every
cranny for the gaud. Sundry solutions of
the mystery, scandalous and otherwise, were
proffered at the time, but one who was on
duty during the disturbance says that no
clue w’as ever discovered to support the most
feasible theory. Barstow is now in charge
of another mace, understood to be silver with
an overcoat of gold-leaf, for which the Pea-
cock Government paid £3OO, The one used
in the Federal Parliament is built of wood,
and has its complexion renewed by a glider
for about 80s. every year or so. The tem-
porary loss of this bauble once started
officials swooning all over the place, and on
its recovery—it had been mischievously mis-
laid by a quilpish member —'the sigh of relief
could be heard in Oodnadatta.
Adelaide sends a line or two
The visit oi the British Migration Delegation has
given women’s societies a hectic week. Miss Pott
went straight from a yawnfully long mayoral recep-
tion at the Town Hall to lunch with the Victoria
League executive (she is a member of the English
executive), then to a Settlers’ welcome-tea, and in
the evening she was speaker at a lecture on migra-
tion organised by the same body. The second day
was much the same, except that the lunch hostess
was the Migration Committee of the National Council
of Women ; the afternoon went in exchanging views
with the feminine department of the Liberal Union
(with the Premier and Minister Of Migration as
guests), and the National Council of Women gave
its benediction to the evening lecture. That night,
too, was booked for the Government House reception,
to which Miss Pott (in gold and blue brocade) went
on in time for supper, and for a mayoral ball at
Unley at which the Bridges had a turn or two before
getting back to say how-de-do to their own guests.
The vice-regal reception was largely an official affair,
and overflowed for supper into a marquee on the lawn.
Lady Bridges topped her dress of apricot chiffon vel-
vet with a diamond tiara, and dripped pearls from
her neck and shoulders. The Barwell lady and Miss
Murray were in black, the Moulden dame in silver-
blue brocade (she, by the way, is off shortly for a
trip to Japan), Mrs. H. C. Dutton in black, Mrs.
Barr Smith in be-crystalled mauve satin and Mrs.
Keith Bowman in gold lace and apricot brocade. It
was an early party, and the last taxi was pretty
well clear of the gates before half-past 10.
Other excitements of the week have been largely
collegiate. The Governor laid the foundation stone
of Prince Alfred’s War Memorial Hall —which is to
cost £lB,OOO-odd, and only £9OOO is so far in hand
—and a couple of evenings later he was a guest at
the Prince Alfred Old Scholars’ dinner, after a coun-
try team of ex-collegians had given a town one a
severe trouncing at football. There was also an old
scholars’ match against St. Peter’s, followed by a
record dance at the Palais in aid of the Memorial
Hall.
There has been a St. Peter’s dance, too —organised
by those of the old scholars who are interested in
the College mission and by the newly-formed feminine
committee to help with the work. It was staged at
Balfour’s, with bridge on the ground floor and
dancing above, the supper sandwiched on the floor
between. Mrs. Harcus had the decorations in her
capable hands, and the committee included the Sydney
Ayers, Fred Porter, Lavington Bonython and Clem
Hill dames and Mrs. Schomburgk and her daughter.
Josiah Symon, K.C., has had news from England
of the death of his brother James, aged 88, and, like
his legal brother, a keen Shakspearean. Two of his
family—a son and a son-in-law—have settled on the
Murray since the war.
From England, too, comes news of the death of
T. A. Lewis, National Liberal member for the Welsh
’Varsity in the House of Commons and a Junior Lord
of the Treasury since last year. He married Mar-
jorie Culross, of this State.

PALMOLIVE—The Bond of Beauty
CUSTOMS and fashions change as
the world grows older, but beauty
is eternal. Women have always desired,
and men worshipped, beauty. The ele-
gant women of ancient Egypt share with
you the famous beauty secret of the ages.
For then, as now, a fresh, smooth skin
was woman’s greatest charm, but then
the means were available only to women
of wealth and fashion. Now they are
within the reach of all.
The life of the leisured classes of ancient
Egypt, under the Empire, was distin-
guished for its splendour. Beauty culture
was considered of utmost importance,
and it is recorded that care of the com-
plexion ranked first amongst toilet arts.
Those women knew, as modern women
know, that health is beauty’s first law—
the radiant health resulting from perfect
cleanliness. And they knew, as we know,
that natural cleansers are safest and best.
They used the valuable natural oils of the
palm and the olive to cleanse and beautify
the skin. These oils, prized so highly in
that far-off time, are rendered even more
potent to-day, so precisely are they hand-
led by scientific methods, so conveniently
contained in a fragrant cake of Palmolive
soap. The lather of Palmolive, soothing
and so mild, removes accumulated dust
and powder which, if neglected, clog the
tiny pores which compose the surface of
the skin. Palmolive stimulates the skin
and sets it working; the sense of refresh-
ment following its use makes a Palmolive
bath entirely different from any other.
Palmolive now is easily accessible to all.
Not every woman only, but the entire
household can enjoy the benefit and lux-
ury of this delightful soap. Buy it to-day.
Try it to-night. And every day and night
for a week, and note the improvement in
your complexion.

The business of Home Recreations Ltd. originated over 30 years ago in the establishment of Messrs.
Heiron & Smith, the well-known Billiard Table Manufacturers, whose goods have achieved such universal
popularity that they are now known throughout the length and breadth of Australia.
In 1913 the business of Hebron 1 Smith was registered as a limited Company, and the goodwill of
the billiard, business previously carried 1 On in New South Wales and Queensland by Messrs. Alcock & Co.
was also acquired ill those States. During the next seven years other interests were secured, and the
business expanded so largely that it was decided to reconstruct the Company with a greater capital, and
to broaden the scope of its operations by handling all classes of Recreations for the Home. This was done
in 1920, and the name of the Company was altered to Hortie Recreations Ltd. The Capital of the new
Company was fixed at £250,000; but as this amount was found Insufficient to handle the constantly
increasing business, it Was enlarged during the present year to £300,000.
Up to the present time the shares in the Company have been-held almost entirely by the owners of
the businesses originally taken over. The Preference Shares have' now been placed on the Official List of
the Sydney Stock Exchange, so that an opportunity is now afforded the public to secure an increased
interest in this wdll-established and successful local industry/
BILLIARD DEPARTMENT.
Since 1913 the manufacture of Heiron & Smith Tables has almost trebled, and the esteem in which
these goods are held is well testified to by all billiard players, both professional and amateur. The tables
are protected by exclusive patents and trade-marks throughout Australia and New Zealand.
... ... THE “SALONOLA.”
In 1917 the Company acquired the sole manufacturing and selling rights throughout the world of a
new phonograph —known as The Salonola. This machine was invented in Australia, and is the only
was V th « ■“l**-, Kurin ~ the six y ears that have elapsed since the first Saionola
produced, the sales m New .South Wales alone have expanded from £l4OO to £36,000 per annum.
. V l6 b3 /°?° la , 1S belng ' ™ ade alluost in its entirety in the Company’s factory at Marrickville, and as
£ Directors ’ t- 6 f Ce " tly been established in the other States of the Commonwealth.
,he Directors confidently anticipate an even greater expansion in the sales of this instrument in the near
iuture.
Outstanding evidence, of the merit of the Saionola is shown by the fact that Mr. Henri Verbrugjhen
(ate Director of the New South Wales Conservatorirm of Music, and Conductor of the N.S.W. Sitate
Orchestra) constantly used a Saionola for demonstrations to his pupils, and expressed his high opinion
of its value by giving the Company a written testimonial.
(Mr. Verbrugghen, who is now the Conductor of the Minneapolis’ Orchestra—one of the finest orchestral
bodies m the world—has further shown his appreciation of the Saionola oy recently having one sent to
America for his personal use.) *
.. . +h . „ PATHB’S BABY CINEMA and CAMERA.
During the year the Directors decided to further stimulate their business by purchasing a controlling
interest in Path® .Baby Xhnei.na (Australasia) Proprietary Limited, to be immediately followedj by
a complete absorption of that company’s interests and concessions. This was done in order to secure the
j „ h u S n . ghtS in respeot of Pathr; ’ s recent and very remarkable inventions, “The Home Babv Cinema”
and Baby Cinema. Camera.” These productions are quite the latest achievements of the world-renowned
tom oi Pathft Breres, and are rightly described as perfect pieces of mechanism, adapted to fulfil all that
cculd be desired in a Home Cinema and Baby Camera. They are so simple in construction that any child
can manipulate them, thus enabling beautiful moving pictures to be shown in the home, while competent
authorities have declared that the Paths Baby Camera will probably supersede all other makes of cameras
now m use.
ENGLISH AND AMERICAN RIGHTS OF PATHE’S INVENTIONS.
Messrs. Paths B reres advise t-hrt a Company has been formed to take up these rights for America
■with a capital of £1,000,000 sterling, while a British Company, with Lord Rothermere as President, has
been floated for the same purpose in England. It is worthy of note that Lord Rothermere had secured a
second option over the Australian rights should this Company’s option not have been exercised.
BRANCHES IN AUSTRALIA.
Added to an already proven business in Billiard Tables and a rapid development of the Saionola
Phonograph Department, the Directors, in anticipation of a great expansion of business in the Home
Cinema and Camera, have now opened Branches at 250 Collins Street, Melbourne; 935 Hay Street, Perth;
and 88 Hunter Street, Newcastle, which, together with existing branches in Brisbane and Adelaide, will
piovide the necessary facilities for an immediate expansion of business throughout every State in Australia.
SYDNEY FREEHOLD.
The Directors were very fortunate in securing valuable retail premises at 388 George Street, Sydney,
comprising a modern warehouse of six floors, at a cost of £41,500. The Company has already twice
refused offers of £50,000 for the property.
FACTORY PREMISES.
Ihe Company holds six acres of land adjoining Sydenham Railway Station, on which are erected
substantial and up-to-date factory premises, which, with modern machinery equipment and stocks are
valued at £101,967 14s. lid. All the products of Home Recreations Ltd. are manufactured at the
Company’s works, and-an immediate extension of business to the various States is calculated to give an
increased turnover that will renect immediately on the working costs of these products.
In order to compass the outlay incurred in the above directions, and to provide additional'capital to
cope with the immense growth of the business, the Directors have decided to place the balance of tne
Company’s Preference Shares on the market.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK.
A considerable accession of trade is expected on removal to the Company’s new premises in George
Street, Sydney, and from the three newly-established branches recently opened. Shareholders and the
public generally will be interested to note that, unlike most trading “and manufacturing concerns, the
Directors of Home Recreations Ltd. firmly adhere to their policy of making and selling only such goods
as are protected by world’s patents and registered trade-marks. The outlay incurred, therefore, in adver-
tising and pushing the Company’s goods makes for a largely increasing goodwill, which will add consid-
erably in the future to the value of the assets of the Company. Another factor in the success
of this business is that all lines handled by the Company, being strictly pro-
prietary ones, are wholly controlled by them and are not subject to unlimited
competition. Throughout Australasia no one outside Home Recreations Ltd. can make or sell a
Heiron & Smith Billiard Table or a Saionola.- The Company also enjoys similar protection in its
arrangements as sole distributors of Pathe goods in the various States of Australia and New Zealand.
“The Company has so far had a remarkably successful career, and the
prospects of a bigger business are bright. Last year’s earnings were about
£3500 in excess of the amount which 10 per cent, on ALL shares would
have taken; so if the Company continues to do well, there are prospects of
something more than 8 per cent, per annum dividends which have been
paid in the three years since reconstruction.” (Vide “THE BULLETIN,”
July 12, 1923.)

PROPERLY
After Berrinbo, the G. N. Hurdle winner,
had beaten a weak field in a flat race at Moonee
Valley last Saturday there was the inevitable rush
to back the Ritualist gelding for the Australian
Hurdle Race. Considering that Wildun alone was a
better favorite than Berrinbo in the betting, and
that Wildun ran badly, the victory of the honest
little hurdler merely proved that he is still in ripe
condition. This was his third successive win within
three weeks, and even list. 111 b. may not stop him
next Saturday.
Les Paddington ran very respectably in the Jumpers’
Plat, wherein Myownbay slipped his backers up, and
although Mazax finished ahead of him (only to be
beaten by rank outsider Mammon in the last few
strides) the Sydney candidate looks likely to beat
Mazax over the longer course. The son of Mazagan
doesn’t appear to stay well. It is generally assumed
that Bendoc, wdio hasn’t run since Berrinbo gave
him 111 b. and a beating in the Doutta Galla Hurdle,
will stay the 31 miles to the last inch —but why?
Berrinbo has to give him 161 b. next Saturday, and
the topweight is as well worth backing as the horse
from Bendigo. Roisel is under suspicion of being
somewhat “off,” but is a dangerous candidate, never-
theless. Last year Roisel was runner-up, and the
year previously, with the minimum weight up, he won
easily. Roisei stays all right when in the best nick.
As regards Dunwil there was always the doubt
whether, even with the luxurious weight of 9st. 121 b.,
which is nothing to a horse of his class in hurdle-
jumping company, he would stick out the journey. What
will stick it out? Probably Gulyarri. The objection to
Gulyarri is that he “bears out,” some days more than
others. But he showed himself a long-distanee
battler on one occasion, and with only 9st. he may
outlast Berrinbo, Les Paddington, Roisel and Bendoc
in the Australian Hurdle. The writer’s blessing will
be on his head—-and tail.
Haoma was the hero of the day at Moonee Valley.
He started at evens for the Steeplechase and won
with 12st. 101 b. in his most dashing style. In beat-
ing Coolport the little S.A. champion didn't really
improve his outlook for the Australian Steeple, as
compared with the son of Cooltriin. But he won
easily, and may be the sounder animal of the two.
“0.K.”: The Steeplechase that Ilaoma won
last Saturday was Coq d’Or’s final earthly journey.
The ancient English gelding broke a leg and was
destroyed. The name of Goq d’Or should survive as
a warning to those who assume that an imported
nag with a good English record is sure to make good
in this country. He was one of the few imported
failures that Dick Bradfield has handled. He was
always going to do something, and an infatuated
public made him first favorite for a Newmarket
Handicap. But he never won a race in Australia.
Put to hurdle-racing Coq d’Or was a dud. Put to
steeplechasing he fell, and the vet. did the rest.
“Fax” : Some poor performers in a general
way have contrived to win the four miles over the
Caulfield jumps. Cuffs, the victor in 1918, did
nothing much before or afterwards. Algous, who
beat Sir Prim in 1919, because that accomplished
jumper stopped to nothing in the run home, has
since proved himself a duffer. Gazomp had no luck
after capturing the event in 1921, and Bright Maid
hasn’t won a race since she made her big splash last
year. Unless the Maid comes again next week
one will think that racing has got on her nerves,
and that she would like to get married and settle
down.
* * * *
“Old Sufferer”: Odious is the snuffle of
those Vic. politicians who “deplore” the recognition
of gambling by betting taxes. The Government
has taxed betting at Flemington ever since trains
began running to the course. To the extent that
it is excessive, the railway tariff is a tax on book-
makers and backers. At Cup time it is an enormous
impost, yielding thousands a day. Fares to the
racecourse platform are double and treble what
are demanded from travellers to the Agricultural
Show on the' same line, a little nearer town. Cer-
tainly they were reduced by 33 per cent, some
years ago, but 3s. first-class and 2s. second are
monstrous charges for a few minutes’ run in the
train. And the only passengers who don’t pay them
are members of Parliament,
# * # *
There won’t be much betting on the Spring
handicaps while the form of these expensive imported
horses remains a matter of conjecture. In previous
seasons there have been newchum gees of suspected
merit, and for a short run of years the Caulfield Cup,
in particular, was much affected by imported horses
that didn’t show up so brilliantly in the Melbourne
Cup. But none of them came with English creden-
tials equal to what the best of the newcomers can
show. The question of acclimatisation is very im-
portant, and quite open, at present, in several cases.
Remembering King Offa and Lucknow, imported
winners of the Caulfield Cup in successive years,
punters are bound to have an eye to Backwood,
trained by the same Bradfield w 7 ho put an Australian
polish on the aforesaid pair. Still Backwood has
Bst. 131 b. in both the Cups, which is 201 b. more
than the handicapper gave to his compatriot Sliil-
linglee, who has had more time to get seasoned, and
has a third in the Sydney Cup to his credit.
* * * *
“Wilfrido”: A stay-at-home Wellington
(M.L.j punter gave his mate a pound to put on
a horse at Trentham, “all up’’ on two other steeds.
No. 1, Sir Roseberry, came in and paid a fiver
on the tote; No. 2, Master Strowan, returned a
dividend of £2B. The bettor now had £l4O in
hand for his friend, and was -acutely perturbed as
to whether he should risk the lot as instructed. After
taking a consensus of opinion, he decided to invest
£lOO on the third nag, Wrangel. This romped
in at £l4. Entire satisfaction was expressed by
the punter, who told the other not to worry about
the £4O but to hand him £l4OO clear.
* * * *
“Gimlet W.”: Is there anything more em-
bittering in the way of punting than to do your
money on a steed owing- to its ill-timed chivalry?
A friend of mine had this experience at the Robbery
Park trots. Having backed a succession of losers, he
went for a recovery in the last race on a stallion
called Snodger, or something like that. Snodger
was 150 yards behind scratch in a two-mile race,
and the money looked good when lie made up his
ground in less than a mile. It seemed a home-and-dried
proposition when Snodger was pulled in behind the
pacemakers, Gentle Annie and Good Queen Bess. But
with four furlongs to go Snodger hadn’t improved
his position, and the baoker grew audibly anxious.
When the rider applied his whip, without disturbing
Snodger’s inclination to remain in the same place,
there was dismay in the Snodger camp. Then a
' cry of agony broke from the baffled punter. “Look
at that blinkin’ Snodger! ” he yelled. “Look at
’im! ’E won’t go parst the mares!” And neither
he would. A thrilling finish between the two dames
resulted in Gentle Annie beating Good Queen Bess
by a neck, the invincibly gallant Snodger being a
length away third. The rest was profanity.
* * * *
Out of Westralia, where Thorn, Kay,
Morey and GreensliTelds learned their boxing, nas
come' another promising smiter in Young Butcher.
Fighting at 9st. 71b. the youth with the meaty name
punched too hard and too fast for Jack Finney (9st.
8 fib.) in a 10-rounder at the S3’dnev
Stadium. A left over the heart sent Finney
down for “seven” before the first minute
nad elapsed, and the Pyrmont lad was floored
for “eight” and “two” in the third. Finney came
back strong, and fought well for the rest of the bout,
but Butcher had a big lead at the end. In the other
10-rounder Ernie Symonds (9st. 21b.) got a decision
over Harry Pearson (Bst. 131 b.), who comes from
Melbourne. People have got tired of paying the out-
rageous prices demanded bj r the Stadium manage-
ment, and the crowd was poor.
ERNIE BAXTER, the Lithgow (N.S.W.)
featherweight. By defeating Billy
Grime at Melbourne he won the Aus-
tralian title.
“Snow”: Eugene Criqui did not long retain
the world’s featherweight crown, after wresting it from
Johnny Kilbane, for he has been beaten pointless
by Johnny Dundee. His victory over Kilbane didn’t
impress the critics, some of whom declared that he
was far from being a world-beater, and that several
U.S. fedders wouldn't have been a bit troubled by the
punch that settled Johnnie. Which suggests that the
boxers Criqui knocked-out in Sydney were a very
second-rate lot.
“15-30”: The Australians have erased the
weak Hawaii team from the Davis Cup competition.
Anderson beat Detrick and Hawkes accounted for
Eklund without losing a set, and the same thing
happened in the doubles. Meanwhile the Japanese
Shimidzu, Fukuda and Kashio made short work of
the Canadians. In the light of his figures against
Rennie, Fukuda is a much better performer than
was considered on this side. The quality of Rennie
was regarded as pretty high in Canada, and for a
new man like Fukuda to drop only three games in a
straight-three win argues considerable facility with
the racquet. The cable mentions his playing a fast
driving game, which should afford the Australians
more trouble than the comparatively discreet tactics
of his older countryman, Shimidzu, who relies on
place and accuracy rather than pace, and can only
be lured from the baseline by a rain of drop shots.
Shimidzu had a much tougher battle with the other
Canadian, Crocker, and the fact that he dropped one
set and had two others carried to 9-7 and 8-6 before
he triumphed suggests that he was either off-color
or is definitely inferior to Fukuda. The Australians
will have to battle hard to beat the Japs. If Pat-
terson were in the team one would feel more optimis-
tic, for Patterson’s slashing service and devious out-
play would probably smash up Shimidzu’s much-
vaunted defence, whilst the same tactics would bother
Fukuda. Tilden has proved that the Japs can’t cope
with a cannon-ball service. And this is the very
department in which Anderson and Hawkes are lack-
ing. Anderson’s first ball has some speed, but unless
he has improved it, his second is a lolly that invites
contemptuous treatment. Hawkes gets tremendous
turn on the ball, but then its flight is rather high,
with a consequent loss of momentum that makes it
dependent for aces on the player’s ability to conceal
the direction of the break.
* * * *
“Linesman”: W. M. Tilden, world’s tennis
champion, has issued an enthusiastic tribute to the
Spaniard Alonzo, who recently beat him in a
Middle West tournament. Alonzo, he says, has made
a meteoric rise to international fame, and must now
be regarded as ranking among the world’s best six.
A couple of years back Alonzo was unknown outside
Spain and France, and his first appearance at Wimble-
don was nothing to rave about. But last year he
sprang into notice by beating Pat O’Hara Wood in
a five-set Davis Cup contest, and his speed and re-
source on that occasion astonished the seasoned Aus-
tralian. He is said to be proficient in all the ground
strokes, rather than showing especial brilliance in
any one, and he relies on his youth, confidence and
enthusiasm to carry him through the most gruelling
battles. Alonzo has a great respect for the Austra-
lians, of whom he has been good enough to say that
they have a fighting ability second to none. I should
like to see how Anderson gets on with him. If they
do not encounter one another in the Davis Cup they
might meet in the U.S. national singles.
* * * *
“Pantagruel” : C. B. St. John, the Queens-
lander, has again won his State’s metropolitan
tennis singles and doubles, the latter in company
with Wilson. It was his fourteenth victory in the
singles, his first being in 1908. Turher beat him in
1909, but since then he has been undefeated. He
has won the doubles 10 times with six different
partners. Goodness knows how many more cham-
pionships he has collected, for he cleaned up the
cracks in Rockhampton, many years ago, before he
went to Brisbane. One wonders how the little man
does it with his one remaining hand. But he is
tremendously active, and in his white knickerbockers
and black stockings (these he has lately abandoned
for socks and pants of the all-the-way-down descrip-
tion) he used to be curiously suggestive of a bird.
* • * •
“Timson”: Dr. W. Allan Stewart, owner
of the coursing champion Vanity Verse, which brought
the Vic. Waterloo Cup to an unsatisfactory con-
clusion the other day, was a first-class amateur run-
ner a decade ago. Grounded at Carlton College
(Vic.), he went to London to study medicine, and
while there joined the London Athletic Club. He
won its 100 yards championship in a fraction over
even time, and that against a stiff wind; and on
September 23, 1911, he sprinted 50 yards at Stam-
ford Bridge in 5 3-ssec., thereby establishing a Bri-
tish record which still stands. Two championships
in Scotland followed, and a visit to Sweden, where
runners are of no mean quality, as “Slip” Carr can
testify, brought the doc. a bagload of silverware.
Among the baubles were 10 first prizes.
Harold Parcell collected the trophy hung
up for the Queensland five-mile cross-country cham-
pionship at Rocklea. His time was 29min. 0 2-ssec.
Parcell is coming south again to see if he can add
an Australian title to his list. Last year he finished
ninth in the N.S.W, five-miles, but is likely to do
better this trip.
-i * * *
“Jacky Boo”: The toughest proposition
E. W. Carr will strike in Europe is E. H. Liddell,
of Edinburgh Uni. Liddell galloped over 100yds.
in 9 9-10 see. the other day. I played football against
the youth in Scotland in 1922, and can certify that
he’s slicker than “Slip” on the Rugby field, at least.
He holds the Scottish records for the 100 and the 220.
A 30.000 crowd went to Essendon to see
how the “Same Old” would shape against South Mel-
bourne, conquerors of Fitzroy and Collingwood. The
game was fast, open and clean, with clever handling
and good teamwork. Neither side had much to swear
by up to lemon-time, but after that the Red and
Whites tired and ’Don ran out winners by 68 points
to South’s 51. In a hard, rough game Collingwood
vanquished St. Hilda by 43 points to 31. The, Mag-
pies, with three or four injured men “resting,” had
two more carried off the field before half-time, but
even with that handicap their system carried them
through. Geelong travelled to Fitzroy and downed
last year’s premiers by 52 points to 47, which dis-
aster, following on last week’s four-point defeat,
moved the Maroons’ barrackers to beer and stoush.
Two years ago Carlton and Richmond fought out the
premiership final : last Saturday they seuflM to
determine whmh shouldn’t be last on the list. Carl-
ton won —by 59 to 40—so the Tigers stay down in
the mud, along with Melbourne.
The last-mentioned team, having an idle Saturday
on their hands, visited Sydney, and were trounced
by a N. S Wales 18. They began well enough, and
were leading by 22 to 19 in the opening quarter;
but N.S.W. came to light in the second and third
terms, and at the final bell they owned 14 goals 12
behinds to 10 goals 14. For Melbourne Harker got
five splendid goals. H. Finch, little Milton and
Kuschert distinguished themselves for the winners,
whose marking and passing were particularly good.
Play is decidedly on the up-grade in N. S. Wales.
“Trekle”: In the Australian game of foot-
ball classy followers, back- and centre-men can gener-
ally be picked up, but forwards of real ability have
always been scarce. In the early days, when the
kicking of three goals in three hours by any team was
regarded as phenomenal scoring, much was not ex-
pected of them, and no record tallies were collected.
Phil McShane, a Geelong player of 40 years ago, is
often spoken of as the first really great Australian
forward: while Albert Thurgood, who, for Essendon,
kicked 63 goals in 1900 and 64 in 1901, is regarded
as the best that ever played. He dominated the game
wherever placed, and no opposition could stop him.
The finest individual effort, however, was Dick Lee s
for Collingwood, when his team was beaten by Carl-
ton in 1915. Though guarded by two splendid back-
men—Billy Dick and Alf Band—Lee kicked 9 et
Collingwood’s 10 goals, and also hit the post twice.
That year was his best, and he topped Thurgood s
1901 record with a total of 66 goals. Cricketer Roy
Park and Jimmy Freake were both good goal-sneaks ;
and Dave McNamara (107 and 81 goals for Essendon
Association), Jack Hutchinson (67 and 68 for Rich-
mond and Footscray), and old “Silver” Caine (70
for North Melb.) did well in the Association. Many
players would be capable forwards, if it were not
for the roughing that always comes to a man in that
position, and others, game enough and clever at get-
ting the ball, play there without success because they
are erratic kicks anywhere. But the real reason ol
the scarcity is psychological. Men are awed by the
occasion—by the absolute necessity of success. Other-
wise, why do seasoned footballers, able to pass the
ball in the tensest moment with absolute accu-
racy to a fellow-player at a distance of 40 yards,
often miss an opening seven yards wide and heavens
hi S h? „
The N. S. Wales
R.U. team to tour
Maoriland shortly will
have to go with-
out the services of
“Pup” Raymond, one
of the best wing-three-
quarters the State has
produced. Instead of
crossing the Tasman,
the big Sydney Uni.
medico has packed his
bag for Oxford as
N.S.W. Rhodes scholar
for 1923. “Johnny”
Wallace, who preceded
Raymond last yea r,
stepped straight into
the Oxford and Scot-
land XV’s. There are
few Sydney followers
of the game who do
not consider Raymond
Wallace’s superior in
all points of the Union
code. Raymond played
for N. S. Wales against
the A.I.F. in 1919 as
full-back. As a three-
quarter he has distin-
guished himself against
the All Blacks, the
South Africans and the
Maoris. He is an old
Grammar boy, and a
prince of good fellows.
North Sydney, League premiers in 1921
and 1922, came a thud on Saturday against Balmain.
’Main’s forwards were noticeably superior on the
day, and the side thoroughly deserved its 16—13 win.
“Junker” Robinson, Fraser and George Robinson, for
the winners, and Peters, Thompson and the youthful
Waterhouse, for North, were about the best bunch on
the field. Eastern Suburbs went to the head of the
class by inflicting a severe drubbing (19 to 5) on
South Sydney. Caples played one of his old-time
games, and Watkins was never in .better form.
Western Suburbs licked Glebe again, but only by
1 point, 9 to 8; and ’Varsity drew with Newtown,
each scoring 2 tries and 1 goal. Easts are top of
the premiership list, and level with Balmain for the
City Cup. # '
“Centurion”: The good the Light Horse-
men did in Palestine lives after them. l< irst of men,
they introduced Rugby Union football to the Holy
Land, and the feet of the Anzaac Mounted Division
were jubilant in the sacred places of Israel. Now
comes news that the French have organised a Rugby
Union in Syria. The other day at Damascus Syria
beat Palestine by 8 points to 5. Most of the players
were drawn from the French and British armies of
occupation.
“Past Grammar”: What looks like the
grand finale of the case in which Lawton, Queens-
land Rhodes scholar and Oxford Rugby Blue, was sus-
pended on charges of having played professional foot-
ball in Australia, was seen in a recent London law-
suit. George Harnett, a former international and a
leading writer on Rugger, was sued by Major Stanley,
Oxford’s delegate to the Rugby Union, for libel.
Harnett had hinted that Stanley was the mysterious
Unknown whose representations to the R.U. had
started all the trouble. Which seems peculiar, since
Oxford stood by the Australian to a man. Anyway,
apologies and costs prevented what might have been
some interesting evidence.
❖ * * *
“Adelaide”: What The Bulletin lately
wrote about differing interpretations of the Aus-
tralian code was well illustrated by the Tassies’
game against South Oss in Adelaide. Victoria com-
plains that S.A. umpires make the game faster than
do those in Melbourne, by letting the player “come
through” with the ball. Well, Tas. left S.A. standing
still. Pace and dash, and handball just on the edge
of a throw, made a delightful game to watch, but
one that S.A.’s second XVIII simply could not cope
with. What the first team might have done is a
matter of guesswork; at the moment they were get-
ting a horrible beating in Perth. As they had pre-
viously badly beaten both Westralia and Victoria, the
form is unaccountably mixed, and the coming visit
of S.A. to Melbourne should be full of thrills. Mean-
while, Westralia, which won the premiership of Aus-
tralia rather unexpectedly at the last “carnival,”
must be considered to hold the title still.
* * * *
“Hypo”: “Tren” (B. 12/7/’23) seems to
be under the impression that Mullagh, the abo.
crickdter, died soon after his return from the English
tour of 1868. Johnny played many a good game
for over 20 years after that. He did a lot to help
the Harrow (Vic.) team to win the Murray Challenge
Cup in the early ’eighties. On the proudest day in
my humble cricketing career I caught Johnny out
for o—his0 —his first and only “duck,” I believe. This
was about the end of 1889. Mullagh died in
August, 1891. A granite memorial stands in the
Harrow cricket-ground reserve, and there is a
headstone over his grave in the township cemetery.
DISCOURAGING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“It was discouraging- to think that a trainer of
horses could make more in a year than many a
school-teacher could earn in a lifetime.” — W. M.
Hughes in an address at Wesley Church, Melbourne.
Discouraging? For why? What’s set him foaming?
None knows, or ought to know, as well as he
The world is chock-a-block, from floor to doming,
As ’twere, with pedagogue and dominie ;
But chaps to train a Beauford or a Gloaming
And turn him out just as he ought to be,
Secure to land such odds as may be laid,
Ah! such are born, not made.
Teachers of kids abound in massed battalions.
Their title to renown would you compare,
Their claim to Fortune’s gifts and Fame's medallions,
With those of master spirits rich and rare
Who’re wise to all the ways and wiles of stallions,
And just what weight a three-year-old can bear,
And when a plater’s forelegs should be fired ?
Billy, you make one tired!
A bitter grievance, truly. And you spin it
At least with finely simulated woe.
Church audiences may think there’s something in it.
1 wonder if you do yourself, who know
You snavelled once, in something like a minute,
Much less a year, a single wad of dough
Sucn as a lifetime’s work to few would bring.
Was that —discouraging ?

TOURING CAR
Sturdy and vigorous after years of hard service,
there would seem to be no limit to what the
car will do.
This exceptional strength is not to be mar-
velled at when you consider that one-eighth
of the total weight of the car consists of chrome
vanadium steel.
Every part, in fact, which takes a major strain,
is built of chrome vanadium. And many more
pieces of alloy steel are used in vital parts than
normal wear requires.
Dodge Brothers product enjoys the world-wide
reputation it does, because each part and pro-
cess which enters into the car is determined
upon this same high plane of excellence.

THE INKY WAY.
“Wilfrido”: The old read poetry ; the middle-
aged quote it; the young live it.
“Q. Land” : Talking of printers who went on the
land (B. 19/7/’23), Senator Crawford, now in the
Federal Ministry, was once a cotnp. on a Brisbane
paper. He took up sugar-growing in the Far North,
ai d is now what the Age calls a Sugar Baron.
“Cuzenos”: The first newspaper to be published
in tropical Australia was the Port Denison Times,
a small weekly sheet which came to light in
Bowen (Q.) on March 5, 1804. Its editor, F. T.
Itayner, is still a pleasant memory in the harbor
village.
“Jumbo”: Crossed over in Brisbane at 79, New-
man Sapsford, who for 21 years compiled and edited
Sai*- food's Almanac of Queensland. His parents
died when he was in his ’teens, and he battled on,
caring for his four younger brothers, one of whom,
an architect, supervised the construction of the Syd-
ney Town Hall.
“Adelaide”: The linotype played Hickson a nasty
trick in Adelaide. His first “laying on of hands”
in the Cathedral was preceded by singing of hymns.
The afternoon Journal spread some fine writing- over
the scene, and quoted the hymn about coming for
“healing of the mind.” But the lino, spelt “mind”
with a w, and made Hickson look like a patent-merli-
Ctne dealer.
__ “Hamer”: The direction of the Sydney Theatre
Magazine has been relinquished by Frank Hill, who,
with the aid of Lala Fisher, made it a success. Hill
was a lieutenant of John Norton on Sydney Thuth
when he felt the call to run a theatrical journal. A
while back he accidentally acquired a broken leg, and
since then his health has shown the need of a holiday,
which he is now taking. Wallace Nelson is the new
editor. He, too, was at one time a Truth henchman
in W.A.
A brick seemed to fall out of the Temple of
Journalism in Sydney the other day when Robert
Nall died. He had been 30 years on the Dailv Tele-
graph, and there was hardly a man tramping the
Inky Way during that period who did not know him
and have an affection for him. His long term as
news editor is among the finest traditions of the
King-street house. Coming from England as a
youngster, he started to dabble in printers’ ink at
12, and the Mount Alexander Mail, Colac
Observer (Vie.) and Hobart Mercury knew him
before he came to the D.T. Nall was a deeply re-
ligious man, but broadly tolerant and notably kind-
hearted, though the office often echoed his wrath when
things weren’t going the way they should. He had
been out of harness nine years and was 74 at the end.
“R. 8.”: Munsey’s absorption of New York dailies
proceeds; he has absorbed a score of good papers
and most of them have gone out of publication. He
bought the Sun and killed it as a morning daily.
His latest purchase is the old-established Globe
at the price of 2,000.000 dollars. He has merged
it in the Sun, and Globe readers have responded
by refusing the Sun and going over to the Evening
W orld, which may have been the thing aimed at.
Munsey buys and destroys, but continues to make
millions. Generally regarded as. a wealthy wire-
puller for Wall-street, the fact (if it is one) may
explain his otherwise foolish destruction of flourish-
ing journals. Fifteen years ago the U.9.A. had to
deal with the intrusion of Big Business into life-
insurance. Worse results by far are liable to
ensue on the collaring- of influential newspapers.
Jack McLaren (Lond.) : Some of the reviewers have
given it in the neck to Thomas Burke, of “Limehouse
Nights,” for his newly-published “London Spy”;
but the bluntest attack was an anonymous postcard
which arrived when I was lunching with him the
other day. “Limehouse” read it, laughed and
handed it to me. It began “You vile, despicable,
crawling worm and stinking liar,” went on to
declare, among other things, the book to be the
“most false, rottenest compilation that had ever
degraded a printing press by its contact,” and ended
with a burst of beautifully torrid personal abuse.
“Too many adjectives,” was Burke’s genial comment.
“A noun should stand on its own feet. A little
sub-editing would make it much more effective. I've
a good mind to do it.” And he did.
“Sturt”: Adelaide Register has had to fight its
first libel action for many years. Two local men got
an idea that trading-coupons, which were made illegal
in South Aus. in 1904, might be revived if they
offered no cash benefit, but admission to a picture-
show instead. Some suburban theatres were willing
to consider the scheme, but the Grocers’ Association
got busy and squashed it. The Grocers’ lawyer gave
the facts to the Register ; and the paper added: “The
two persons concerned in the scheme have not been
found, and the office has been closed for the past
week.” Plaintiffs thought that this remark injured
their reputation to the extent of £3OO. The Judge
decided that the scheme was unlawful, and that its
promoters couldn’t object to anyone saying so ; but left
to the jury the question whether the par. threw mud
on their character in any other respects. The jury
said that it didn’t.
“P.X.”: What dear old snobs most of our doctors
are! I have had the luck to come out of a good
many “waiting rooms” lately, and in only one case
have I found ain Australian publication on the
table. I’ve seen the Illustrated London News,
Sketch, Mirror, Punch, and a dozen other English
periodicals, some of them good, others wretchedly
bad, but never (except once) any of the numerous
well-printed Australian publications like the
Home or Sydney Mail. The idea, I am told, started
back in the past when the doctor wanted to give
his visitors the impression that he was a “Home”-
trained man and not the mere product of an Aus-
tralian medical school. And though that sort of
pretence is no longer profitable since our Herbert
Maitlands and the like got all their training in
Australia, the old snobbery with regard to waiting-
room literature still prevails.
“McNorth” (Lond.) : Two Australian blaek-an I '-
wliiters making good in London are Will Farrow
and Rick Elrnes, Melbourne boys who came across
the water to the war, and have been adventuring
in Fleet-street ever since the Armistice. Farrow is
already widely known as the creator of the “Miss
Mai Fair” drawings in the Daily in which
he makes a goggle-eyed young female indulge in
malapropisms and other unconsciously humorous
remarks. Farrow holds something of a record for
versatility, his work having appeared in papers as
wide apart as the English Review and Comic Cuts.
His caricatures of famous women in the former
journal brought him considerable kudos at Hamp-
stead and other highbrow haunts. Elmes has a
retainer for the Ilulton firm, which produces ump-
teen journals of various kinds; but other work of
his appears all over the place, particularly in Lon-
don Mail.
“Flicker”: Some of the short stories about Aus-
tralia in Yankee magazines are delightful. I picked
up a copy of Adventure recently, and rapidly became
absorbed in “The Salving of the Berwick,” by Albeit
Richard Wetjen. It chronicled the doings of one
Captain Larson, who had put in to Albany (W.A.)
with his pearling schooner, and engaged in chaffering
with a marine dealer, Red Isaacs, the villain of the
piece. Isaacs “gave orders to a half-starved black
boy,” who dug up “three arrogant, burly ruffians,”
owners of part of the pearling fleet which always
haunts Albany. The reader was next introduced to
a “beachcomber” without whom no Australian port
such as Albany or Coogee would be complete. This
gentleman made a desperate attempt to burn the
hero’s ship, assisted by two “niggers, natives of
Albany, shiftless, worthless fellows.” After a deal of
gunplay and other thrilling scenes the hero succeeded
in salving £200,000 worth of pearls from a derelict
steamer, and set sail for Adelaide, while his baffled
enemies, “cursing in bBche-de-mer English,” remained
disconsolate in Albany, where “the road outside was
dun-colored and dusty, baking hot under the fierce
noonday sun.” If only I’d known what Albany
really’ was like I wouldn’t have spent my time there
playing ping-pong.

‘‘Enter Madame,” now at Sydney Cri-
terion, arrived 18 months after "The Great
Lover” was produced at the same house.
Both deal with amorous experiences of
grand-opera stars, Latin and tempestuous
and temporarily domiciled in the U.S.A.,
and comparisons are thrust upon the jaded
playgoer. They are not to the advantage
of Gilda Varesi’s comedy. Her Lisa Delia
Itobbia interests but doesn’t convince, where-
as Ditrichstein’s Jean Porel did both. There
was nothing inherently improbable about
Jean or the highly effective scenes in which
his creator involved him, whereas the audi-
ence finds itself wondering whether so capri-
cious a celebrity as Lisa (Gertrude Elliott;
could really cherish a lasting passion for a
middle-aged bourgeois of Boston (Cronin
Wilson), who yearns for the hearth-fire and
the home-acre and a wife who will see that
his slippers are warmed o’nights. And it
would probably laugh more at the comic
Italians in Lisa’s entourage (Maggie Moore,
Athol Forde and William Mollison) if simi-
lar capers hadn’t been cut by the more natu-
ral people who clustered about Jean. More-
over, the stuff gets very thin after the
second act, especially when an imbecile
American reporter arrives, and the inter-
vals seem very long this wintry weather,
although the orchestra does its best. Still,
the second act, in which Lisa charms her
Gerald away from the widow (Lilias Walde-
grave) who has agreed to warm his
and whose telephone messages ring vainly
in Gerald’s apartment wdiile the entente cor-
diale is being patched up in an adjoining
room —the second act, with its supper scene,
in which J. B. Rowe gives a lifelike imita-
tion of a healthy young man eating cold
roast goose, is very good indeed, and Miss
Elliott does it excellently. She is a grace
ful, well-preserved woman with a voice which
it is always pleasant to hear, and the women
gaze pop-eyed at her gowns—particularly
a wonderful thing in jade green and gold.
Not a great actress in any sense of the word,
but altogether admirable. There is nothing
Bostonian about Gerald, as impersonated by-
Cronin Wilson. He would pass anywhere
for a middle-aged Englishman. However, he
is very amusing, and nothing else matters.
Others in the cast are Gex-trude Boswell,
T. M. Oliff and winsome young Anne
McEwen.
The Repertory players put some of the
best wmrk Sydney has seen them do into
Shaw’s “Pygmalion,” which had a successful
run at the Conservatorium last week. In
this paradoxical Shavian outburst there are
three outstanding characters —Elizabeth Doo-
little, the flower-girl, whose ambition is to
become a lady in a florist’s shop ; Higgins,
maddeningly pedantic, overbearing and egotis-
tic ; and Alfred Doolittle, the dustheap philo-

sopher. These people of the comedy were
represented by Mrs. Pitt Rivers, Herbert Mil-
lard and Vincent Doyle with faithfulness,
subtlety and occasionally even with brilliance.
Theirs was a nec-k-and-neck success. As
Eliza Mrs. Pitt Rivers enjoyed herself im-
mensely ; the oaths rippled off her tongue as
glibly as if her forebear were indeed a
Cockney dustman instead of a Governor-
General. She looked pretty and graceful, and
frocked the socially-ascending flower-girl in
some fascinating creations. Mrs. Cam
Marina, as the harassed housekeeper, Mrs.
Pearse, fitted the part neatly, and so did the
remainder of an unusually strong cast.
The 200-year-old “Beggar’s Opera” will set
fancies straying back at Sydney Palace on
Saturday night to the days of wigs and beau
patches and coffee-houses and sedan chairs
and highwaymen and all the assorted rascality
that gathers enchantment from its remote-
ness. Also, there will be gay staves and
snatches hummed to tunes that were familiar
in London before Captain Cook was breeched.
At Her Majesty’s, Sydney, “Mary” con-
tinues to present a mixture of merry measures
and more or less mirthful melodies. It is
light and tasty fare that goes well with radi-
ant side-glances and chocolate caramels.
Lydia Lipkovska finished up her Sydney
season on Tuesday at a matinee crowded with
people and enthusiasm. The attractive little
Russian has created a taste in Sydney for the
costume recital; but somehow we can’t see
Melba or Buckman in a crinoline.
An American lady, Ruby Norton, de-
scended upon the Sydney Tivoli at the end
of last week, with blonde hair and a large
reputation in her own land. She owns an
agreeable voice, and with this and a pleasant
manner she scored a first-class pass in a
repertoire of songs ranging from near-high-
brow to ragtime and sob-stuff. Included in
the lot was “Croa-
jingalon g,” a
shocking thing she
is said to have
paid a hundred of
the best for; but
as it sings itself,
the liftman and
the milkboy are
whistling it, though
that doesn’t mean
much, liftmen and
milkboys having a

and her accompan-

Washing Day is every day except Sunday
at Sydney Lyceum, with Mary Piekford
cleansing dirty linen in “Suds.” The
“World’s Sweetheart,” with her flair for
bottom-dog roles, is a laundry drudge—with
drastic results to the screen shirts and the
ribs of the Lyceum’s customers. “Fans”
have the chance of also viewing “A Wife’s
Awakening,” in which the man who has been
engaged to wind up the clock and put the cat
out proves to be a crook of the crimsonest
dye. At the Strand, “Racing Hearts” give
many hints on how to break the speed-limit
laws, but much of the propaganda is miti-
gated by the mirth provoked by Theodore
Roberts, one of the few natural humorists
of the silver sheet. The Rialto delivers a
sermon with thrift and hard toil as the
texts, and the rise of a concrete-mixer to
fame as the reward thereof. The Lyric is
“Dr. Jack’s” latest consultation-room, and
big game is being stalked at the Empress.
The Piccadilly looks forward to crowded
houses with “Quincy Adams Sawyer” on its
bill; and the Crystal Palace features
“Robin Hood,” which is more Fairbanks than
Hood, but is a great film nevertheless.
Theatrical things in Melbourne are as they
were last week, but an Event is at hand.
On Saturday, at the King’s, the comedy
company headed by Irene Vanbrugh and
Dion Boucieault will play Pinero’s “His
House in Order,” for the first time in Aus-
tralia. A first-class comedy, with a first-
class interpretation, should remind the local
public that the stage has its uses, other than
to drive mere Thought away and banish
Meditation. A great greeting awaits the
principals of “His House in Order.”
* * * 3:
“Tangerine,” at Melbourne Princess’s,
retains its color and activities in the eighth
week of its age, while “Rockets,” at the
Palace, is even more responsible for keeping
popular patronage busy in the top end of
Bourke-street. Comment on these twin
shows is confined to the remark that May
Beatty is in great form as the King of Tan-
gerine’s discarded spouse, and the first part
of “Rockets” concludes with scenes, songs
and costumes of 10U years ago, wherein
anachronisms run riot, especially as regards
crinolines and rural dissipations in the north
of London. But picturesque anachronisms
were really made for revues.
# * *
At Melbourne Majesty’s the music and
royal domestic interest of “Sybil” account
for large and profitable audiences. The
mystery of Gladys Moncrieff’s magnificence
in her mock character of the Grand Duchess
remains unsolved, and the question why some
of the military chorus wear g;reen pants with
blue tunics, or vice versa, still awaits reply.

“The Cat and the Canary” continues at
Melbourne Royal. It is a melodrama tiiat
offers anyone the choice between a cold
shudder and a hearty laugh, not to mention a
contemptuous snort. Also its frequent inter-
ludes of darkness afford much rest for the
eyes, apart from other considerations.
The bill at Melbourne Tivoli was rein-
forced lately by a “famous Pianist in Panta-
loons,” but the new musical turn is not
more interesting than the brief four-act
humorous tragedy recently staged by Alan
Brooks. Brooks, the smart young American
author of “Dollars and Sense,” has put
a number of bright lines into the mouth of
the character he plays, and his sketch of the
society vampire girl, who has dollars in her
heart and motor-cars in her mind, is quite
forcibly presented by Phyllis May. In the
hard, unfeeling fascinations of Phyllis there
is the warning which wise men heed, and
their trustful brethren don’t. Brooks is the
sceptic who doesn’t, and he is left to soothe
his regrets with whisky and soda when his
male friend takes Phyllis off to buy her more
motors and further diamonds. A small
Japanese servant acts as the timely corrobo-
rator of the lie that prevents Phyllis being
bowled out by her pitiable spouse.

Melbourne Town Hall, where the Philhar-
monic Society has been treating Gounod’s
“Faust” with due respect, will shortly break
out in eruption again. On Saturday (lith)
Moiseiwitsch and the Symphony Orchestra,
with Zelman behind the baton, will conspire
in Beethoven’s “Emperor” Concerto. This
performance will be a matinee, but on the
following Wednesday the same combination
will give an evening concert. Evelyn Scot-
ney starts a series of six concerts on the
night of the 11th, and will ultimately get
her dates intermingled with those of Lydia
Lipkovska, who begins to sing under Tait
management on August 18. By that time
the hall should have shed some of its wintry
temperature.
* * * Hs
“The Voice from the Minaret,” which
shudders along between Bombay, Damascus
aim London, is exhausting Norma Talmadge’s
large stock of emotions at Hoyt’s Melbourne
house this week. The tale comes from the
Robert Ilichens factory and is full of the
unutterable things that can be better filmed
than said. “Racing Hearts,” at the same
house, is of secondary interest, but there is
a threat of originality in letting the heroine
win a forchin in a motor-car instead of on
the back of the usual neddy. Heading the
week’s strife at the Majestic is “813,” an
Arsene Lupin story that is guaranteed to
defy premature elucidation. “Dangerous
Curve Ahead,” on the same bill, must not be
mistaken for a Touring Club’s sign or even
for an allusion to an entrancing feminine
contour. It is merely a reference to the fact
that Love’s highway contains sundry devil’s-
elbows which must be negotiated with cun-
ning. For Melba supporters this week Mrs.
Rudolph Valentino, as “The Woman in
Chains,” is especially piquant. The Brit-
annia relies on “Bell Boy 13” to keep the
rent-man bright and smiling.
* * * *
Melbourne sees some etchings:—
Six by Norman Lindsay have stimulated popular
interest in the show of etchings at the Melbourne
Fine Art Society. Of the half-dozen, “Argument,”
“The Dance” and “Scherzo” are manifestoes on the
pictorial importance of the Human Female. They
express a movement that seems less suggestive of
happy vitality than of a wearied roystering spirit
defying repose; but the drawing is as good as ever,
and the detail is a wonder to the inquisitive eye.
In “Death in the Garden” the performance is no
less vivid, if the imagination appears a little tired ;
while the chief point of “The Land of Afternoon” is
the fine treatment of the luminous background haze.
A. Hugh Fisher attaches his neat signature to SO
prints which vary considerably in quality. A “View
from the Wengen Alp” is reminiscent of the manner
of Paul Helleu, but there is more satisfying work in
his architectural studies, of which “Stonegate, York,”
is a pleasing example. Then there ar e 11 from the
needle of D. Y. Cameron, who appears to have spent
some absorbing afternoons studying the dreary
wastes around the Esk. But his best is a picture
of heavy shadows stealing into the half-light of
Tewkesbury Abbey. J. C. Goodchild contributes
some impressions of London a»d Sydney, his most
pretentious subject, Waterloo Bridge, being some-
what sharp in handling. All that need be said
about H. van Raalte’s “Wayside Gums” and “Bracken
Banks” is that they should go far to remove a lot
of prejudice against the limitations of etching,
“Bracken Banks” is a gem.

“The Sentimental Bloke,” at Adelaide
jLvoyal, gave this critic unexpected pleasure.
It is free from the buffoonery so much relied
on in the “Our Selection” plays. Eileen
“IF WINTER COMES." AT MEL-
BOURNE ROYAL.
Mark Sabre (Garry Marsh) is congratulated
on his enlistment by Rev. Sebastian For-
tune (Geo. Blunt).
Alexander as Doreen, though necessarily a
cut above the Bloke, is not so refined as to
make him an unfitting mate for her, and
“Mar,” formerly accused of over-acting, is
now subdued by Stella Payter to fair comedy
lines. Tal Ordell makes Ginger Mick the
most popular figure on the scene. His acting
is fine; but Walter Cor nock touches that
higher stage of not seeming to act at all, his
earnest, uncomfortable Bloke being of the
type which can be met anywhere. At the
Prince of Wales’s is Henlere, the musician,
who elects to be funny half the time; and
at the Majestic Joseph Brennan (with Ida
Newton) and George Ward have some bright
spots. In pictures, there is a spectacular
“Fall of Babylon” at West’s, working up
some points from “Intolerance” into a. long
story. At Wondergraph, Mary Miles Minter,
as a pleasing and unconscious bigamist, pur-
sues her fate from N a or 1 ; to Central Africa,
and all the Faces of melodrama are eclipsed
by one on a bar-room floor at the York. Also
the delightful Westminster Singers are back
again at the Town Hall before moving on to
Sydney Town Hall, where they open on
August 4.
“£ s. d.” : Toots Pounds is bound to intro-
duce imitations of actresses and actor-r-s
into “Rockets” before the season closes. A
turn for mimicry has been a valuable feature
in the Pounds girls’ success. Lorna and Toots
shine at it. As youngsters they would appear
at a Melbourne “society” function with imi-
tations of Harcourt Beatty and Nellie Stew-
art in “Sweet Nell.” “Imitations” were in
the vaudeville act they did at the Tivoli
about a dozen years ago, and “imitations”
accounted for the sisters getting a long run
at the London Palladium, where artists, as
a rule, are engaged for only a week or two
at a time.
“10-2-4”: “Phil Cowan” is right (B.
26/7/’23) in objecting to my calling Gus
Elen an imitator of Albert Chevalier. If I
had said that Chevalier was an inspiration
to him it would have expressed what I meant
better. Elen greatly refined his style after
Chevalier came to the front. I can remember
him doing crude carmine-nosed turns at the
old Middlesex (Drury-lane) in the days
when an M.C. sat on a dais in the stalls.
But “Cowan” is wrong as to Elen “keeping
his songs clean at a time when a little sug-
gestiveness was expected in a vaudeville
turn.” For instance, he was the first to
sing “I Ain’t A-goin’ Ter Tell,” which was
all about a lady whom the singer’s best pal
had just married. “I knows ernough ter break
’is ’eart,” Elen used to drone significantly;
and then, more brightly, “but I ain’t agoin’
ter tell.” It was a gem. as regards both
words and music, but fairly reeking with the
stuff that made Yvette Guilbert’s songs a
success in London. About the only old-time
London vaudevillain whom I recall as never
having dealt in “smut” (meaning sexual sug-
gestiveness) was the master of them all —
Dan Leno. And even he now and then edged
a bit of Rabelaisian dirt into his numbers —
as when he exhibited the side of bacon in one
of his shop-walker sketches.

“Norbell”: The boys of the old brigade of
playgoers will certainly sit up and take
notice of the reappearance here of Irene Van-
brugh and her husband, “Dot” Boucicault.
A lot of limelight has sizzled over both
mummers since they were last in Australia.
Irene Vanbrugh was here with John L.
Toole, and he finished up in these parts at
the Sydney Roya.1, on Christmas Eve, 1890.
“Dot” came to Australia in 1885, with his
father and his sister Nina, and all three
played in the old man’s Irish dramas.
“Dot’s” first appearance was as Harvey Duff
iu “The Shaughraun” at Melb. Royal, with
Dion senior as Conn, and Nina as Moya,
'i ne S. M. Herald speaks of “Dot” as be-
ing “a boy” at the time, but his parts were
grown up, for he also played Danny Man in
the “Colleen Bawn,” Captain Coldham in
“Kerry,” etc., and he had already written
a drama, “The Omadliaun.”
“Thersites”: Both “Dot” Boucicault and
Irene Vanbrugh took part in the historic
production of Lytton’s “Money” at Drury|
lane in 1911, King George having “com*
manded” the performance in honor of the
visit to London of Mr. and Mrs. William
Ilohenzollern. The cast also included Fred
Terry, John Hare, Cyril Maude, Charles
Wyndham, Beerbohm Tree, George Alexan-
der, Laurence Irving, Alfred Bishop, Lewis
Waller, Edmund Maurice, Charles Hawtrey,
Sydney Valentine, Weedon Grossmith, Nor-
man Forbes, Dennis Eadie, Edward Terry,
Henry Ainley, Gerald du Maurier, Norman
McKinnell, Harry Paulton, Fred Penley,
Winifred Emery and Alexandra Carlisle.
Many other bashaws of the stage went on as
supers. Boucicault was Crimson, and Irene
Vanbrugh the Clara of that occasion.
“Azalea”: The Melbourne Board of
Health, which used to be active in keeping
theatre-aisles free from obstruction, seems
to have lost its energy in this respect. On
a recent first night one of the d.c. aisles in
a certain playhouse was crammed with popu-
lation. The invasion was started by one
of the managers, and people standing at the
back followed his evil example. In another
theatre the central path down the stalls is
blocked half-way up by a glass platform for
the parade of titbits from the chorus. How
permission for this was acquired I cannot
imagine, but I know that a similar privilege
was refused to another management five or
six years ago. The Board of Health needs
to wake up. This continuous blockage of
exits, which would double the panic in case
of fire, ought not to be tolerated for a day.
“0.K.”: Australia, which doesn’t cultivate
the worship of old stage idols, will have a
chance to be practically sentimental when
Maggie Moore attains the 50tli anniversary
of her first appearance in this country. It
is due early next year. Maggie introduced
her Lizzie Stofel to Melbourne in the first
place, of course. Melbourne was the theat-
rical metropolis of Australia in those days,
so it is there that Maggie Moore should be
given a notable benefit performance and a
testimonial. There is no other actress here,
not even Nellie Stewart, who was the talk
of the town 50 years ago. It is up to old
theatregoers and their elderly offspring to
burn a little incense in Maggie’s honor.
“E.F.”: For the second time within the
city’s experience a performance of “Faust”
in Melbourne has been associated with sudden
death. The first of the tragic incidents
occurred when Federici died on the trap-
door which bore Faust and the Devil below-
stage on the first night of a “Faust” season
at Melbourne Princess’s. The second liap
pened the other Tuesday night at the Town
Hall. There Mr. Milton’s chapter closed
whilst he was seated in one of the front
chairs at a Philharmonic Society’s treatment
of Gounod’s work. Milton was a musical
man, a member of Zelman’s Symphony
Orchestra, and the performance had arrived
at the prison scene when someone was re-
ported as having “fainted.” The ushers car-
ried the body out without provoking much
excitement.
“Histrionicus” : “Second Murderer” asserts
(B. 5/7/’23) that the Broughs and Emma
Temple appeared 38 years ago in “La Fille
du Tambour Major,” Brough playing the
drum-major. I presume he refers to the first
Australian production of “Tambour.” If so
he is wrong. Fred Mervin was imported for
the drum-major part, and when he couldn’t
appear (he was frequently ill) J. J. Wallace
took it, Wallace’s role, Bambini, being played
by Farley. Pattie Laverne was the lead
(Stella), H. R. Harwood was the Duke, and
others in the co. were Albert Brennir,
“Daddy” Hallewell, Maggie Liddle, Nellie
Stewart (as the drummer-boy) and Minnie
Hope. Not the Broughs. In the last revival
of the piece, under Bill Anderson’s manage-
ment, Edward Farley was the drum-major
and made a hit.
“L.H.P.”: Allan Wilkie promises Sydney
“A Winter’s Tale” during his season at the
Conservatorium Hall. It hasn’t been done
here since March 25, 1882, when Louise
Pomeroy doubled the roles of Hermione and
Perdita at the old Royal. Others in the cast
were Julia Merton (Paulina). Jessie Gray
(Mopsa and Time), J. B. Steele (Leontes),
Herbert Flemming (Florizel), Harry Jerdan
(Polixenes) and Joe Stark (Autolycus). Joe
Tolano, still to be seen round the town, was
an Old Shepherd. “The Tempest,” another
production contemplated by Wilkie, was last
staged in Sydney at the old Prince of Wales's
in 1869. William Hoskins was Prospero,
Nat Douglas Ferdinand, and Charles Hall
NO USE TO HIM.
LADY : “John, I wish you'd find out where
my husband is. He’s in a fearful state,
and I’m afraid he’s gone across to the
Vulgarity.”
WAITER: “That’s all right, mum. He won’t
get in. I seen a notice up, ’Standin’
Room Only.’”
Caliban, the women being Florence Colville
(Miranda), Kate Corcoran (Ariel) and
Eleanor Carey (Iris). Alfred Clint did some
wonderful work with the brush. The open-
ing scene exhibited the deck of a ship in a
storm, which was omitted from the produc-
tions of Charles Kean, George Rignold and
Henry Labouchere.
“H.K.”: David Burn may have been the
first actual Australian playwright (B.
19/7/’23), but the first play written by an
Australian to be locally produced was “The
Hibernian Father,” by one Geogehan, pre-
sented in Sydney on May 23, 1844, by W.
Nesbitt. The first effort printed was Edward
Reeve’s “Raymond, Lord of Milan,” the
author being on the S. M. Herald. The
printers were Ilawksby and Cunningliame,
of King-street, and the year was 1851. “Ray-
mond” was staged in 1863, and had a suc-
cessful run.
“A.J.C.”: “Pitt Streeter” (B. 19/7/’23)
displays his ignorance when he compares
Josie Melville with Nellie Stewart and Mrs.
Brough. I was 30 years at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s, and my judgment is that Nellie and
Mrs. Robert are in a class of their own. I
have seen Mrs. Brough in opera, burlesque,
modern comedy, modern drama and Shaks-
peare, and never once did she give a bad
performance. As for Miss Stewart, for
ability and versatility, plus personality, Aus-
tralia has not had her like. Our finest prin-
cipal boy in pantomime, our greatest comic-
opera artist, a stunning Marguerite in
“Faust,” an unforgetable Rosalind in “As
You Like It,” complete mistress of her art
in roles like Zaza, Du Barry, Sweet Nell,
PROOF POSITIVE.
POPPY : “I don’t think it’s a play a girl ought
to go to.”
PERCY : “What makes you think that?”
POP: “Well, the seats are booked up for
weeks in advance.”
Camille and Kitty Bellairs—such is her
record, and to set a one-part success against
it is utterly ridiculous. “Pitt Streeter’s”
memory can’t go far back, or he wouldn’t
have raised the question.
“The Deacon”: There is warrant for
“L.H.P.’s” suggestion, strange as it may
seem to those who didn’t know the man, that
Harry Leston’s career was injured by chronic
sea-sickness (B. 26/7/’23) . Harry had such
a weak stomach that even the ferry trip from
Circular Quay to Manly used to knock him
out. I have seen him arrive at the Car-
dinal’s College in a state of utter collapse,
and in the end he had to give up his job
there.
“Uramao”: Unburdening his soul to a
Maoriland reporter, Johnnie Farrell, one of
the Firm’s managers, declares that the high
cost of shipping, railage and labor has spoilt
M.L. for the showman. Johnnie complains
bitterly of the entertainments tax, but the
public pays that, doesn’t it? A more legiti-
mate grievance concerns the Stage Hands’
Union. Should a member work only '/
hours in one week he has to receive a full
week’s wage, but if he works 49 hours the
following week he is entitled to an hour’s
overtime. That is in accordance with the
Arbitration Court award. The “Peep Show”
co., says Johnnie, went £3600 to the bad
during its tour of the islands. Louis Benni-
son dropped a similar amount, the Lee White
co.’s deficit was £3OOO, and that of the Gros-
smith co. £lOOO. Still, the Firm is heroically
carrying on.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : About the most discon-
certing experience that could come the way
of a mummer was a first-night engagement
with Bland Holt. Bland invariably stood in
the wing to watch a new man, and his antics
were alarming. He would tear his hair,
grind his teeth, toss his arms appealingly
towards the flies and call on Providence to
rid him of the offender. Yet when the har-
assed person made his exit he would fre-
quently be told that he had done quite well. But
that wasn’t said to a well-known Sydney
amateur who was given a trial as a pro.
Holt’s act off-stage so flabbergasted this un-
fortunate that lie stopped denouncing the
lawless lover of the golden-haired village
maiden, walked towards his now-frantic em-
ployer, and argued the point. “Well. Mr.
Holt,” he said, “that’s the way Dir. Norman
| then stage-manager] told me to do it.” The
amateur was missing next night.
“Wilfrido”: There is a tradition labori-
ously encouraged by publicity agents that the
greater the musician the more fabulous in
worth and melodious in tone must be the
instrument on which he plays. This pro-
bably accounts for Gerardy’s violoncello
being valued by E. .1. Gravestock at £lO,OOO,
The maker, Stradivari, would have been
pleased if he knew. His own has probably
lasted better than any other he ever made,
and this has been appraised by an expert
at £5OOO. All his life the maker clung to
it, and after his death it was sold by his
son, Paolo, to the Count di Cimabue. But
none of Strad.’s violas or ’cellos rank as
equal in workmanship to the bulk of the 1100
fiddles that bore his label. The boom in
prices is of comparatively recent origin.
In IS7O the best in the market could
be purchased at Christie’s for £2OO
or £3OO. At present it is estimated
that the value varies between £6OO and
£3OOO, according to preservation, construc-
tion and date, the old Italian losing his dash
when he was about 70. Sarasate is credited
with performing on the best Strad. heard
in public, while Kubelik has one that made
even Kreisler envious.
“Ashmead”: Launceston (Tas.) has a city
choir which does things like Elgar’s “Ban-
ner of St. George,” Coleridge-Taylor’s “Hia-
watha’s Wedding Feast,” Stainer’s “Cruci-
fixion” and “The Messiah.” Its work is emi-
nently creditable to all concerned, but the
organisation is so poorly supported by the
public that it is thinking about disbanding
Schubert Fuller wielded the baton at the
latest performance. Perhaps it was the dis-
couraging outlook that made him shake his
stick at the instrumentalists at the last re-
hearsal. “There’s not one of you playing
together!” he roared.
A Digger vouches for this:
Val Vousden, mentioned by “Caesar’s Ghost” (B.
19/7/’23), was a tough old bird. He went abroad
with the 22nd Battalion, and was the life of the
troopship. None of those who came back will forget
his impersonation of Maud Allan. (Val was 59,
nearly 6ft., and weighed about Bst.) Marching with
the battalion from Mena to Heliopolis—-about 14
miles and a hot day—-he told us of a one-man show
he had given, 30 years before, on the top of the Great
Pyramid. Dysentery got him at Gallipoli, and he was
sent to hospital. When the word came for him to
go, he was on duty in the fire-trench. Feebly
raising his rifle to the parapet, he pulled the trigger.
“I’ve fired my last shot,” he murmured, and sank
back. However, he returned to the battalion in
France, saw Pozieres through, and was in great form
at a concert at Poperinghe just before we went into
the' Ypres' salient. I saw him in ( ollins-street, Mel-
bourne, in 1920, looking younger than ever.
“Mancam”: We were yarning of how
prices of admission had soared of late years,
when the Old’un broke in:—
That’s right. These early doors, amusement taxes
an’ all that’s the limit. When I was a pincher in
the East End, you could see five-act drammer an'
a farce thrown in for one brown. Fact. I’ve seen
“The Dumb Man from Manchester,” followed by
“Betsy Baker,” for a penny. There used to be
keen rivalry between the different gaffs, too. Once
when Cloghorty, at the Imperial, was trying to
down Marcellus Pummock at the Duke o’ York’s, lie
announced “Admission one penny, including refresh-
ments.” Cloghorty was in the money-box hisself.
He had half a ton of carrots for tickets, and as each
penny was handed in he handed out a carrot —ticket
and refreshment combined. No one could get in
without showin’ a carrot. Them was the days.
“Whitebait”: Jane Savile, who plays the
spook-haunted spinster in “The Cat and
Canary,” at Melb. Royal, is an advertise-
ment for Beerbohm Tree’s School of Acting.
One of Tree’s cleverest pupils, she scored her
first success as Esther in an amateur produc-
tion of “Caste.” She afterwards escaped
notice in Tree’s perpetration of Stephen
Phillips’s “Nero” (or “Zero” as an irrever-
ent weekly printed ft), but made a good im-
pression in the provinces as Rose Maylie in
"Oliver Twist.” Since that time Jane has
stuck to the higher plane of drama, and those
who saw her in “If Winter Comes” are likely
to endorse a recent Australian opinion that
she is an actress of more ability than her
present theatrical circumstances allow her to
demonstrate.
“Adelaide”: The influence of the Wild
West “pitcher” still spreads. In an Adel-
aide suburb a boys’ football game was in-
terrupted by a player aged 13 falling, shot
in the abdomen. The origin of the shooting
was mysterious, but at last it was found
that the child had been playing football with
a loaded revolver in his pocket!
“Second Murderer”: Deadheads are the
blight of the touring company’s existence.
So many advance-agents are like “Hamfat’s”
(B. 26/7/’23), and make good fellows of
themselves all over the country. Every
shopkeeper who displays a daybill is certain
to present an order for two, and then expect
his three kids to get in on the nod as well.
All the ladies from the pub, from the cook
who made the paste to the fairy who folded
the agent’s pyjamas, have been presented
with “complimentaries.” The railway em-
ployees expect them; likewise the carter, the
boys who delivered dodgers, the policeman’s
wife and mother-in-law, and the washer-lady
and friend; and the avant-courrier’s love-
affairs may be traced by the number and
attractiveness of the flappers who line up
with “stiffs.” Sometimes a full house pans
out at 16s. 9d. or thereabouts, and the un-
happy manager may have to tell the landlord
a tale to get out of the town.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: They are telling it of a
Sydney showman who was asked to give a
lady an engagement. He happened to know
her, and his testy inquiry as to what she
could do brought the reply that she proposed
to sing popular songs. “Popular songs!”
snorted the showman. “Why, dammit, man.
once that woman sings a song it ceases to
be popular!”
THE WHY OF IT.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The modern psychologist knows that our shocked
recoil from anything is in direct proportion to our
own (repressed) affinity with that thing.”— Dulcie
Deamer analysing, in the Daily Telegraph, tne
wowser attitude towards Norman Lindsay’s conscien-
tious nudes.
Babe at the breast, /
The fact that you recoil >
From castor oil
With every sign of loathing
Convinces me
'Tis but affinity
(Repressed).
You long for it, I know,
Deep in your heart, although
Your struggles make you spill it on my clothing.
’Tis yearning, not aversion, makes you shove
it from you, love.
Some shudder when they hear
Discord from jangling bells
Or hawkers’ raucous yells;
Others express
Unmitigated horror at the smells
That soap-works scatter on the Footscray breeze,
Or nausea profess
At the aroma of Limburger cheese.
Is it; repulsion sheer,
Think you ? No fear !
Could they but diagnose the shock, it’s, not
Abhorrent. It’s because it hits the spot—
Convention deep below —
That it affects them so,
Did they but know.
And they who gaze affronted and aggrieved
At nymphs on canvas splashed
Unhaberdashed,
In artless joyanee,
And find the spectacle a sharp annoyance,
Or, worse, an outrage —ah! these censors, too,
If they but knew,
Are by themselves deceived !
A slight acquaintance with psychology
Would surely make them see
The fiercer and more withering the strictures
Evoked by fleshly pictures,
The deeper the appreciative zest
(Repressed).

“THERE'S MONEY IN THE PEN.”
There is an enormous demand from News-
papers, Magazines, Advertisers, etc., for
strong, forceful illustrations, and they pay
high prices for work that suits them.
Why Not Learn Drawing?
You can! Easily, rapidly and thoroughly,
bv the
WESTON METHOD
It takes you step by step from the rudiments
of sketching to the very highest branches of
this fascinating and lucrative profession. The
lessons are so simple that you cannot fail to
make rapid progress, and, remember, we
teach to draw, not to copy.
Enclose 3 stamps, with your name and
address, and we will post you a copy of our

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice fexcept of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted: and no MS. will be relumed
unless stumps accompany.
Carstone: We are told that the S.P.C.A.
had its eye at once on that disastrous shipment of
M.L. fat cattle, and that one of its officers was pre-
sent at their unloading. .. .O.E. (French I.): Sorry,
that's sold. Certainly, let’s have a look at them...
D.R.D.Now, did you ever hear anybody talk like
that ?... .Anon: “League of Nations” hasn’t one
new thing to say... .Philgee: Typewritten copy that
goes six lines to the inch is stuff to make any sub-
editor reduce his teeth to powder. .. .Thirla: Too
much bone and too little marrow.... G.O’C.: The
yarn rambles like a lost pup. .. .A.A.A: Too small
a point... .C.K.T.: Rather a dull d0g.... Curlew:
It is spoiled by artificial rhymes—the horses’ names,
for instance—and by the loose lines that knock the
metre out of joint. . .8.C.F.: Not up to the mark...
Tom A.: It gets bushed.... Mentoplay: So rugged
that we wore out a perfectly good pair of boots
climbing over it....J.J. (Toowoomba): Too much
of it is whiskered commonplace. .. . M.W. (Perth):
Why drag in the poor old nightingale and all the
ancient machinery ?,.. .Energy: You have a plot,
but spoil the yarn in the telling. And the ending
won’t do. . . .T.P.D.: One plods on without metre; the
other is very ragged.... W.W. A.: Crude and lumpy.
...Corpuscle: “The Arabesque' is very bad verse...
; M.P.M.: Old matter often lapsing into sheer futility.
Anglican: Has a promising beginning. Pity to spoil
it. . . .W.J.W.: An old theme, and a camel would
give it a smoother passage than you have done....
Oliver B.: It has an uncommon, flickering effect: —
Well, I’m shot, meeting you here.
Whatever brought you, Sam, out here?
And riding such a lovely hack!
Come on in, we’ll ’ave a snack.
How’s things been treating yer ?
All right? Sold out the Old home—
Looking for some’at out here.
Htdlo ! Hullo ! Whose on the ’phone ?
It’s me. Who’s me? You know old Mick?
I do. Well, I’m a-talking.
Listen. I’ll tell yer in ’alf a tick ;
W-what’s ’appened in the morning?'
What’s happened then ? Hurry up !
Wait, wait. The doctor.
Once more we filled ’em up;
Then I saw him out of the door.
Hullo! Hullo! Yes. It’s me, Mick.
Yes, I’m telling yer what’s ’appened ;
Mary’s got two on ’em. Come quick—
Mother-in-law and two nurses to attend.
.. .Terry: They just say the obvious things in nearly
the old phrases, and occasional'y fall over their own
feet. . .R.E.W.: “Stevens” isn’t suitable. . .Chuck :
Yes, it’s the only thing we could do with it. . .L.G.
(Botany): Fair verse, but short of interest. . .Graeme
R.: You must get a better idea of rhyme... 11.0’D.:
The eye-destroying thing is not well enough done. . .
Fred-de-dink: Nothing printable in it. .. . J.A.C.:
Poor album verse. .. .F.T.C.: The tree must go back.
. . .A.R.N.: “Mary” is no more cheerful than the one
who owned the small sheep.... Mirza: Your Bill
doesn’t pass.... Me Jonah : Not much of a yarn....
Willie Waitabit: An idea, but not well enough
handled. .. .Nardoo: Ditto.... H.C.L.: Very bad....
M.R.G.: They are all poor in thought and go badly
out of tune.... Alcran: Too tame for the improbable
thing it is. .. .5.A.8.: Shearing yarn doesn’t amount
to anything... .Allan A.: Not the goods. for this
barrow. .. .R.G.N.C.: One has a chance. . . .F.L.E.:
You should be able to sell it elsewhere... .Senojo:
Not worth while J.L.S.: It goes as heavily as a
wet washing-day... .D.R. (Parramatta): Can’t find
the alleged mirth... .C.C.M.: Misses.... .W.M.8.:
It doesn’t get near enough to coo-ee. .. .William C.:
No g00d.... Harry P.: “The Wager” is too obvious.
. . .L.W.H.: Now, what made you think we could pos-
sibly want that kind of thing ?... .Plodder: Alas,
“Freedom” must be trodden under foot once more. . .
Q.P.: “Lunch” is altogether too superior for its
limping lines. .. .Molly H.: You picked up shells
when a child, and since then have ceased to do any-
thing but remember the original pastime. Well, well!
. . .Norman C.: Can’t find any improvement. . .E.M.8.:
Mild moral verse with neither force nor originality. . .
Billy B.: Lacks point. . . .Lou : Clumsy. .. . A.P.T. :
Same old rambling commonplace that finishes up in
the wilderness.... Secco: As funny as a dishonored
cheque. . . .S.S. (Sale) : Much obliged ; but the artist
can’t see a picture in it. .. . Prsetor: You may know
all about your subject; but when a man writes in
vague generalities we always suspect that he doesn’t.
.. . . A.T.N.A.: Sorry, but we’re afraid it would do
more harm than good. .. .Cretonne: No hope until
you get down off those verbal stilts. .. .L.F.: Some
good stuff in “Raw and Finished,” but your points
are not sharp.... Tantalus: In the circumstances
better let that matter drop.. . .T.C.1.: Don’t know
what else you do besides verse-writing, but what-
ever it is you do it better. . . .Tarago: “Crusade”
got into the semi-finals; but the far-fetched coinci-
dence wouldn’t let it go any further. ... W. Bren:
“The Worm” has quality; but it moves a bit too
ponderously... .J.M.W.: We’re overstocked in hor-
rors... .Country P.: You don’t make that Dalton
yarn very convincing. .. .Querist: It is worth re-
writing in one-third the space.... H.E.K.: Really
happened, did it ? Glad to see the label
of legitimacy upon an old friend that has
been calling on us about twice a week for 10 years.
.. . . D.0.R.: Hardly worth it, but have another shot.
.. . .K. 8.8.: Write name and address on back of each
par....J.W: Most of them have grown old; the
others are not worth poddying.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Aliquod: Studies show some promise; others
mostly careless drawing... .C.C. : The first con-
vincing answer we’ve had to the old conun-
drum: “When’s a dog not a dog?” M.M.:
Decrepit old gag....G.H.: One at least is a
barefaced theft from Printer’s Pxf. Ess Kew:
That about fits it A.P.: May be worth while to
take lessons... .A.E.: Lady with the withered hand
turned down with much enthusiasm... .H.A.R.: Both
gag and drawing weak. .. . A.G.M.: Wooden. . . .1.K.R.:
Feeble imitation of Betty Paterson... .L.A.S.: Not
a hope... .W.S.: Old joke badly illustrated....
C.O.McN.: Misses 8.M.: Things that are just
dashed off are just dashed awful —you’ll never get
anywhere without serious effort. .. .RW.C.: Gag not
worth it.
“Vanikoro”: Vancouver was not the father
of brewing in Maoriland (B. 19/7/’23).
Eighteen years earlier Cook, during his visit
to Dusky Sound in 1773, compounded what
he called spruce beer for the use of his crews.
Cook’s “spruce” was the rimu, and to correct
the astringency of it he used equal quantities
of manuka leaves. With a decoction of these
leaves and molasses mixed with cold water
he made “an excellent drink.”

“Plaza Tooth Paste is undoubt-
edly the best for the teeth. It
not only eleanses, but makes the
teeth pearly. As a preservative
it has no rival on the market.”
Miss WINNIE TREVAIL,
44 Premier Street,
Marrickvillej N.S.W.
There is Nothing like a
Smile when the Teeth
are Plaza Cleaned.
Plaza-cleaned teeth aid a charming smile. There is
no charm like the smile of a lovely woman, but the
essential of a smile is the beautiful sparkle or clean,
white teeth. What a delight to know that your teeth
are white and pearly, and that you can smile with
every confidence and not need to try and hide the
teeth!
Use Plaza Tooth Paste night and’ morning, and see
how delightful it keeps your mouth and gums. You
will find it a better Paste than you have ever used
before.

‘‘Hannibal Swordfish”: It will evidently
be news to “Gartot” (B. 5/7/’23) that a
factory for the manufacture of potassium
iodide from the kelp abounding in the
vicinity was started at Southport (Tas.)
years ago. The seaweed is gathered by
scythes and rakes fitted on a raft attached
to a motor-boat. The kelp only requires to
be dried and burned; then the ashes are
soaked in water, and the resultant crystals
are potassium iodide.

Departments follow the example of those
county councils in England which run vet.
motor-trucks i Each truck, accompanied by
a qualified man and usually an assistant,
makes its rounds in the county. Some of
the vets., as well as attending to individual
cases, give public lecturettes on the care and

be a boon in our outback.

“Faa-fua” (Samoa) : There sailed into
Apia Harbor recently the barque Narwhal,
whose crew are all amateurs except the
captain, mate, cook and cabin-boy. They
are seeking first-hand information about the
islands, and hope to pay expenses by carry-
ing cargo to the various places they visit.
They are out for adventure and exploration,
and will take moving pictures wherever they
call, the films to go to a firm of cinema
people in the U.S.A. After leaving Apia
they go to Pago Pago, New Hebrides, New
Caledonia, Solomons, New Guinea and any
other old island their fancy dictates.

“H.II.”: There are penniless bookmakers
as well as kings who live in semi-detached
palaces. A registered member of the bag-
bearing brotherhood was lately up before
Judge Wasley in Melbourne to show cause
why he should not be accommodated in a
large stone building over an unsatisfied judg-
ment for £25. He said he made a trifle by
clerking for other bookies, and twice since
the order was made against him he had
raised £6 and resumed business on his own.
Once he was cleaned out by tli e loss of two £3
bets on the first race. The other time he
lasted till near the end of the day, and then
had to walk home. His name was not Moses.

The north-east corner of Pitt and Liverpool streets,
Sydney, with the North Star Hotel thereon, has
changed owners at £32,000. Glasses must nave
clinked here for hard on a century. In the eighteen-
thirties there was a licensed house hereabouts, the
Stonemasons’ Arms. About IS4O Mrs. Louisa Wat-
kins opened a pub on the corner and called it the
Pulteney. In 185/) she left it to open the Angel
and Crown Inn, Liverpool-street West and Sussex-
street South; her next shingle was the Bull’s Head,
in George-street, opposite the Markets. [n 1858 she
was running the Old Woman on the corner of York
and Druitt streets. Then she got the Dog and Duck,
George-street, Haymarket, and finally the Evening
&tai, on the corner of Cooper and Elizabeth streets.
Verily one of the enterprising women of her period.
ri A rour, d the eastern shores of the
trult ot Carpentaria there i s a small shrub-
like tree practically identical with Cinchona
caHsaya, the quinine-tree of Central South
America Chemical analysis of the bark
snows that not only does it contain an alka-
l°id which very closely resembles quinine,
but that like the original V. calisaya, it has
other alkaloidal bodies with strong febrifuge
and bactericidal properties. It has long
been known that the aboriginals of the Pen-
insula and the Gulf use an infusion made
irom a bark for treating gonorrhoea and
other diseases owing their origin to bacterial
organisms, and most likely it is this tree
from which the bark is obtained. A further
i GSGmblance to its South American counter-
part m in the high proportion of alkaloids in
the bark. Every year the Commonwealth
imports a large quantity of quinine, which
is a comparatively expensive drug, when,
possibly, it has growing an efficient sub-
stitute.

“Wilfrido” on an insurance case:—
The decision of the Privy Council in favor of the
appellant, Mrs. Smallfield, in her case against the
National Mutual, brings to an end one of the most
interesting pieces of insurance litigation that has
evei worried the M.L. Judges. The insured, a stock-
agent in Hamilton, early in 1920 took out a policy
for £lO,OOO. He had at various times been a
patient of the two doctors who examined him; and,
in iresponse to the usual questions, he declared that
the general state of his health was good and that
there were no circumstances that ought to be com-
municated to the directors. In January, 1921, his
body was discovered in the Waikato River. Two
inquests were held, and the Coroner on each occasion
brought in a verdict of heart failure. The National
Mutual decided to fight the claim, alleging suicide.
Ihe omis lay upon the co. of establishing .the allega-
tion, and the jury intimated to the presiding Judge
that the co. had failed to do it. Counsel for the co.
thereupon applied to amend the pleadings by adding
a further defence that, if Smallfield had died from
heart failure, the policy was void because he had
furnished false answers; he had failed to inform
the insurers that he had been rejected for military
sei vice in 1918, and that he suffered from pains in
the heart as Ihe result of ’flu caught that year.
Justice Stringer, however, gave it as his opinion
the further defence could not be established, and
refused leave to amend, directing judgment to be
entered for the plaintiff for the whole amount
claimed. Against this the co. went to the Court
of Appeal (Stout, C.J., Sim and Hosking, Js.). This
Court upheld the appeal. It ruled that Smallfield
must be held to have warranted the truth of all the
answers to questions in the personal statement made
by him, so that, if any of these statements were un-
true, the policy was void. Furthermore, the Court
was of opinion the amendment should have been
allowed if there was any evidence to support the new
defence. It was also laid down that when an
applicant for insurance stated in a proposal that his
general and present health was “good,” that amounted
to saying that he was in (full enjoyment of all his
functions and faculties, and that he was free from
any ailment or symptom of an ailment. From the
M.L. Court of Appeal the case went to the Privy
Council, which declined to take any such rigid view
of an insurer’s responsibilities.' The result is that
the oi iginal judgment of Judge Stringer is restored,
and the National Mutual has to hand out the
£lO,OOO, and foot a tidy bill for Costs.

the Governments would, if there were any relief in direct taxation, be available for
development purposes throughout the Commonwealth. We welcome the efforts being
made to simplify the form of taxation, and trust that following this the next, step will
be, in the very near future, to give the taxpayer some long overdue relief m the amount
he has to pay, after the method has been adjusted. . ~
Whilst on this subject, we are of opinion that the public are apt to overlook tiic
fact that, owing to the ownership and the conduct of certain of our enterprises bei g
owned and under Government control —and thus free of taxation that direct taxat o
to the individual must be maintained on a high level, and if there is any further develop-
ment in the direction of Government enterprise, there is always a 11 kel » h °od of direct
taxation being even a greater burden on the general taxpayer In Great Britain .United
States, Canada and other countries, Railways and many other public utilities are con
ducted by private Companies, which contribute large sums to the public Revenue through
taxation. Here, in Australia, that field is shut off from Taxation by reason oi it bem
a Government enterprise: but it is common knowledge that there has been a tendency
to extend this field in many directions. We have to-day here in Australia many e te -
prises of a Governmental nature, which pay no taxation, competing with I rivate Kntei-
prise and, in instances, through the poor returns obtained from the Governmental
venture, contributing to the already heavy burden of the• t«xpayei. Exports

Mary Jones, who died at Rockhampton

“C.M.” : There is a story to the effect that
years ago, when the late Henry Wilkinson
was visiting magistrate to Norfolk Island,
he bought from one of the Pitcairn Islanders
for £lO the original Bible used on Pitcairn
by the mutineers of the Bounty. It was Wil-
kinson’s intention to present this interesting
relic to the Australian Museum; but neither
the Museum nor the Mitchell Library knows
anything about it. Can anyone inform me
of its whereabouts?
“He lilt me on the ncse, blit the old bloko didn’t
mean any harm. I shouted him a drink after-
wards.” — Bush witness at Sydney Central Court,.
If, when you're enjoying a smoko,
Comes one who is bald, old and fat,
Who lands you a whack on the boko,
There’s no need for anger at that!
Just treat the whole thing as a joko,
Go in for a drink, arm in arm ;
He’s only a merry old bloko
Who doesn’t intend any harm!
The recent official trip to Centralia has
already had one practical result. S.A. Rail-
ways Commissioner, having run the vice-
regal train through in 30 hours from Adel-
aide to Oodnadatta, where the railhead looks
north over waste spaces towards Darwin,
has promised that the ordinary time-table
shall be cut down to that also. At present
there is one journey every fortnight; the
train leaves Adelaide early on Wednesday
morning, halts for the night at Quoin and
at Marree, and reaches Oodnadatta late on
Friday evening.
“A Dreadnought”: Gilbert Mant, who
alleges (B. 5/7/’23) that the Englishmen
coming to this country are a dissatisfied lot
of grumblers, says that it is a simple matter
for the immigrant to get a reference from a
J.P. who has never previously seen him. In
this he simply shows his ignorance of the
immigration scheme. The references required
are from (1) last employer, if any; (2) last
schoolmaster; (3) any clergyman of the
parish in which the applicant resides. J’s.P.
do not enter into the matter at all. As for
the immigrant being dissatisfied, when your
own experienced bushmen make such a song
about prevailing conditions, ivhat else can
be expected from a new chum who has heard
such a wonderful tale at Australia House?
“B.”: S.A. Railway Commissioner Webb
has discovered that the locomotives used on
the Hills line are half-power affairs, and that
using two engines on the one train is a waste
of money when one engine can be built to do
the work. Some years ago the State Gov-
ernment had 15 engines built in Glasgow;
the designs were even then obsolete, but the
successful tenderer carried out the work
according to specifications. The Queensland
narrow-gauge locos, pull bigger loads up
stiffer grades on the Toowoomba line than
S.A.’s bulkier engines have to cope with.
Webb is calling for tenders for superheated
locomotives guaranteed to haul more than
twice as much as the ancient RXs which
now make so much fuss about little.
“Chevrons Once”: “Yarrum’s” indict-
ment of Walgett as a town formerly over-
flowing with sympathy with criminals reads
unconvincingly to me. I was long stationed
there officially, starting nearly 40 years back,
and I can remember many cattle lifters being
convicted and sentenced there; seven years’
gaol was the maximum penalty. Walgett
has not been a big cattle centre since the
transition to sheep and wire fences in the
early ’eighties. Prior to that the duffing of
calves was essentially an act of reciprocity
rather than the crime it would be now ; the
old-timer who refrained from doing it would
not have had his fair average. I never heard
of Judge Murray making a representation
for the abolition of the local Quarter Ses-
sions on the ground indicated; it was a
departmental act of economy, and applied
to other places besides Walgett.
“Azac”: “Sucre” (B. 12/7/’23) asks
why tea cannot be grown in this country.
One reason is the cost of labor; climate is
another thing to be considered. The tempera-
ture should rarely go below 50deg. Fahr.,
while a rainfall of 120 in. is none too great,
and the bulk of it must be evenly distributed
through the growing season. The growing
season should not be shorter than seven
months, and all picking has to be by
hand and done every 10 or 14 days during the
whole of that period. A fair average daily
picking is 501 b. of green leaf, which will only
make up into about 121 b. of tea. The coolies
in Java get 2d. per hour; with wages at,
say, 10s. per day the cost of picking lib. of
tea in Australia would be about lOd. Then
there are manufacturing charges to be added.
Queensland and N. S. Wales Governments
carried out tea-growing trials over 30 years
ago, and found them entirely discouraging.
Long before that Uncle Sam had convinced
himself that his country could grow tea, but
not profitably, because of the army of cheap
laborers required.
“Bison”: A report by the City Engineer
of Perth is an indictment of the waste and
foolishness of macadam roads. Admittedly
the ordinary metal road is cheap to lay down,
hut the scarifications, new surfaces and
dressings which it requires every two or
three years double its cost over two decades
(the allotted span for any road) as com-
pared with the reinforced highway. Some
progressive municipalities are relaying with
concrete, but others, pretending to he stag-
gered by the initial cost of 13s. or 14s. a sq.
yard, when macadam is about Os., are stick-
ing to the ancient method, or trying a mix-
ture of stone and bitumen —the latter a by-
product of mineral oil. To the expert there
is no comparison between “reinforced” and
“bituminous”; and the raw materials for the
“reinforced” are produced under Australian
high-wage conditions. But the point of most
importance to those who are not patrioti-
cally disposed to reinforced concrete is the
affection for the substance in the United
States. Figures lately published in the road-
menders’ Bible, “American Highways,”
show- that “reinforced” is rapidly beating
everything else out of the field.

Silent Alarms
Thousands of Westclox are
doing duty where the alarm
never rings. You’ll find them
in the kitchen timing the meals,
in the office regulating the day,
and on the farm guarding the
worker’s hours.
Whenever there is a Westclox
on the job things are sure to be
done on time. Big Ben and the
other members of the Westclox
family set a high standard for
punctuality.
Each clock and watch that
bears the quality mark Westclox
on the dial and tag has earned
that right. Every timepiece
must pass a rigid test before it
can set an example for others.
Every Westclox alarm rings on
time, and runs on time, and
does both willingly, gladly.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IDO not know that we all have muses
To whisper the words our hearts would
sing.
I do not know that our passion fuses
Stubborn ore into bells that ring.
Neither with trumpet, shawm nor tabor
Do our bands on the high road throng.
Quietly, out of the press, we labor,
We of the Guild of the Smiths of Song.
Not at all caring what the pay be,
Caring much that the work be sound-
whitesmiths, coppersmiths, blacksmiths
maybe,
Each at his bench or anvil bound —
Though the toil be hard and the task be
lonely,
The wages poor and the labor long,
One thing matters and one thing only:
That we be true to the craft of song.
So we stand to our work and love it,
Fashioned in sadness or wrought in mirth ;
The wares we make are what all men covet,
Ours is the lordliest trade on earth ;
Chains of heaviness, rings of laughter,
Ship-bell, chapel-bell, ploughshare, gong—
Those of our trade who follow after
Cannot but own us smiths of song.
If they want a gem for their lady’s graces
To tell her praise when the years are grey ;
If they want to honor their holy places,
If they want a gift for a child’s birthday ;
If they want a girdle of faith to nerve them
Where the combat is fierce and long,
Ours is the only trade to serve them.
Let them summon the smiths of song!
Men make laws and men make liquors,
Games and pictures and curious arts,
Ships and cities and signs and flickers
Whereby they think to bind men’s hearts;
But let them fashion them never so surely,
Fetter and padlock, rope and thong,
Nothing can hold mankind securely
But the chains that are forged by the
smiths of song.
Your shadow-shows, like an evil blister,
Fouling the cities, night by. night,
What are they all but moonshine’s sister,
Lost in the'first of the morning light?
Your tinkers’ laws, will they fetter freemen
More than a wand would stop the sea?
Who but the scalds, the bards, the gleemen
Hold the hearts of a land in fee?
This is our faith : that soon or later
Out of our band shall a craftsman rise,
More skilful workman than we, and greater,
Born for splendor and high emprise.
In the gods’ good time, be it slower or faster,
He that we look for, wise and strong,
Into his kingdom shall come as master —
Master smith of the sons of song.
Surely he will come, like the sunlight
Over the twilit morning land,
Gathering many lights in one light,
Holding the nation in his hand.
He will .march straight where w T e but
stumble,
He will work rightly where we work
wrong;
He will strike surely where we fumble;
He will be chief of the smiths of song.
Our journey-work is for his re-malcing—
Gladly we offer it as his due.
All we have fashioned is his for taking,
To melt, to shatter, to form anew.
If we leave but a line that will suit his
measure,
Forge but a link for. his chain of pride,
Be it our glory, and his pleasure :
So will our labors be justified.
Though we be dust he will know us near
him;
Though in Te Reinga our souls may be,
We shall force a way from the dead to hear
him,
We shall have our part in him, even we.
For his land is waiting for him to call her,
Waiting silently, overlong,
Holding her soul for the chains to thrall her
Forged by the master smith of song.^

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
KAMPONG TRATAS lies outside the
stream of commerce which passes
through Bali Straits. Around it is
uninhabitable solitude. Impassable jungle
beats at its back door, and the sea is its
only highway to the outer world. During
the term of the west monsoon its inhabitants
make a precarious living out of fishing, going
out daily with the land breeze, to return with
the sea breeze; but during the east monsoon
even the sea gate is closed. The kampong is
then completely isolated. The great rollers
of the monsoon thunder all day long upon
the beach of black volcanic sand. A stately
procession of clouds marches over the sky,
each discharging over the village a blinding
storm of rain and a sudden hurricane of
wind before it passes away. For six long
months of the monsoon the fishermen remain
idle, leisurely patching their boats and mend-
ing their nets when the weakened spirit
moves them, while their women prepare the
scanty haul of last season for the market.
The potent smell of blachan pervades the
seashore and the kampong, mingled with
the ropy odor of coir, bilgewater, canvas and
rotting seaweed, and the indefinable malarial
smell of a swampy, sunsoaked foreshore at
low tide. Even the fiercest monsoon could
not cleanse the village of its distinctive odor.
Some of the men raise a feeble crop of
jagong and rice, but their unfenced fields are
continually ravaged by the wild pig which
swarm in the jungle; and the workers often
fall victims to the tigers, which prey on
man and pig alike.
The majority sit in listless groups and
watch the furious sea eating day after day
further and further into their cocoanut plan-
tations : a forest of dead trunks sticks up
out of the water, forlorn, like tombstones,
and still-living trees totter doomed on the
verge of a sandy, unstable precipice. The
dismantled dukongs, like shells of giant grass-
hoppers, lie drawn up in a long line in the
grass of the foreshore. The grass whips up
and down as the wind tears across it, and a
spray of salt water and black sand rattles
against the sides of the boats and flies far
inland. Squall after squall sweeps across
the sea, cutting down the horizon to a half-
inile of stormy water.
Late one afternoon a pearling lugger came
running out of a rain-squall towards the
village and anchored just outside the line
of surf. Her crew of four shouted and gesti-
culated to the lazy groups on shore. The
words could not be heard above the roar of
the breakers, but all understood the gestures
to mean that water and food were wanted
and would be paid for. Nobody stirred. Com-
petition is a scandalous thing ; and, besides,
the credit of pearl-fishers is not good along
the Java coast.
Presently the wife of Pa’ Bakea came
down on to the beach. Pa’ Bakea had been
contemplating the gesticulating mariners be-
tween his legs,' but was now lying on his
back rolling a cigarette regardless of the
world. But his wife had a keener eye to
business. She brought him to his feet, and
with shrill words exhorted him to bestir
himself. Thus admonished, he responded
leisurely, taking the line of least resistance.
He got ready a dugout which lay on the
slope of the beach, while his wife filled it
with rice, jagong, blachan, durian, bananas
and big clay bottles of water. Then they
pushed it into the breakers, nobody assist-
ing, for the woman was as skilful as the
man, and, Pa’ Bakea sitting forward with a
short spade-like paddle, and his wife sitting
aft with another, they dashed through the
welter of surf into the wild water beyond,
and were tossing in a moment alongside the
anchored lugger.
The crew of the lugger were Manilamen
of the same sea-roving stock as Pa’ Bakea
himself. They had come, they said, from
the north coast of Australia, and were bound
they would not say whither. Pa’ Bakea sat
forward holding to the stays of the lugger
while the little dugout plunged like a'curbed
horse. His wife tossed the cargo on to
the deck of the lugger, laughing softly at the
not over-delicate sallies of the sailormen as
they handled the bananas and sniffed at the
durians, whose smell awakes the passions of
men and whose fiesh stirs them murderously.
They threw good money into the bottom
of the boat, and Pa’ Bakea dropped astern.
“The woman is fair,” said the captain of
the lugger, looking after the tossing figures.
“She is fair,” agreed the mate ; and they
called to Pa’ Bakea to return.
“There is something more we need,” said
the captain, bending down and putting a
hand under each bare armpit of Pa’ Bakea’s
wife; at the same time Pa’ Bakea felt a blow
on the back of the skull which sent him head-
long into the bottom of his boat.
Next moment the boat was overturned in
the surf and he was dragged out on to the
beach by half-a-dozen hands.
“Wah salah!” he said, gazing after the
bobbing topsail of the lugger, “they may
have her. She was not loath to go, and, verily,
she shall be the curse of God to them.”
He said no more about the matter, and
nobody questioned him. He took to wearing
a kris, which is not usual nowadays
amongst the inhabitants of Kampong Tratas.
When the east monsoon came to an end and
the unhealthy “kentering” months succeeded,
he became restless. His eyes shone with a
wild light, and he took to talking queerly
to himself. His fellow-villagers watched him
anxiously, anticipating the inevitable catas-
trophe that occurs when a man’s mind is
turned too much inwards upon itself.
As soon as the sea gate opened Pa’ Bakea
launched his dugout and paddled across to
Gunong Ikan, which is a hill nearly rising
from the sea in a perfect cone and giving
from its summit a wide view through the
straits of the Indian Ocean. The hill is
laced about with thick jungle swarming with
tigers; and at its top they say there is a
ruined temple which monkey-faced Kala in-
habits, Kala with the face of a brute,_ a
mouth tusked like a boar, a collar of chains
and a waistcloth of skulls. No son of the
Prophet would dare approach the unhallowed
spot.
In the evening Pa’ Bakea returned. His
eyes had lost their wild look, and his face
was composed, but he stalked grimly through
the streets to his house without a word or
a glance to right or left. The people shunned
him more than ever. He was now haram—
unclean. He had gone to the unholy place,
and, returning, had not washed.
This year he did not go with the fishing
fleet on their daily excursions. Every day
he repaired to the top of Gunong Ikan, and
his figure could be seen dark against the
sky keeping a solitary vigil. One evening
he returned earlier than usual. The boats
had just come in, and the beach was crowded.
People noticed he was without his kris.
He passed through the crowd up to his
house with quick steps, and presently
emerged with the wicked little piece of black
and flickering steel in his hand. He went
down to his boat, everybody giving way for
him, and started paddling out to sea. At
that moment a vessel drifted into sight round
the foot of Gunong Ikan. It was the pearl-
ing lugger which had called in at Kampong
Tratas for provisions two months before,
but there was no sign of life on board.
There seemed to be a figure at the helm, but
the sails hung untrimmed, and the boat was
being carried helplessly past on the rapid
current.
Pa’ Bakea was seen to climb up the lug-
ger’s side and disappear into her cockpit.
Presently he emerged and started paddling
for the shore. As he got nearer the watchers
on the beach saw that his kris was between
his teeth and that it was red. His eyes
were wild and glad. As he beached his boat
he cried out: “Verily, she was the curse of God
to them, and there was only the woman left
to kill!”
Then he amokked.
Everybody ran. Pa’ Bakea fled up the
beach and along the village street singing.
He struck at a child but missed. An old
woman, with a tray of rice on her head,
saw him coming and tried to escape. She
stumbled and fell. Pa’ Bakea was on her
in an instant, and she lay where she had
fallen, quite still amongst the scattered rice,
which slowly took on a rosy hue, like the
ceremonial rice thrown at a bride.
Pa’ Bakea rushed on, straight up the
path of the red sun. whose last ray shone
down the street. He was stripped naked
now, and the bath of red sunshine seemed
to clothe his body in blood. His eyes were

TO SAFEGUARD YOUR
THROAT AND CHEST.
The best protection for the throat, chest and lungs is
contained in a handy box of Peps.
When the Peps tablet is divested of its silver wrapper
and slowly dissolved on the tongue, the
Powerful Medicinal Fumes
given off are breathed deep into the chest and lungs.
Thus the Peps medicine comes into contact with vital parts
quite beyond the range of liquid medicine.
As the Peps medicinal fumes circulate through all
parts of the breathing system, their soothing and healing
influence is quickly made manifest. Sore, weak, inflamed
tissues are soothed and healed, dangerous disease-germs
are destroyed, and chest and lungs are gradually
strengthened.
Peps are the most valuable remedy for treatment of
coughs, colds, night chills, throat trouble, bronchitis, old
folks cough, children’s chest weaknesses, etc.
Peps are obtainable of all Chemists and Stores at 1/6
per box, or family size 3/- (containing three times
quantity) ; or post free at same prices from C. E. hulford
(A/asia), Ltd., Sydney.
Keep PEPS Always Handy!
blinded with the light and with the sweat
of his wild exertions. The world had be-
come a whirling phantasmagoria peopled
with vague shades that fled shrieking at
his approach. Suddenly out of this rout of
evasive phantoms two forms leapt up, took
fantastic shape and stood firm. He sprang
at them greedily. Before he could get within
striking distance a cold and vice-like hand,
like the hand of mythical Rama in the way-
ang-piay, gripped him underneath the chin,
lifted him slowly off the ground, and held
him dangling, limp with astonishment, high
in mid-air. He struck savagely at this astound-
ing two-bodied monster, but it held him
in its miraculous grasp at more than ordi-
nary arm’s-length. He thrust fiercely at
the skinny, knotted forearm of the creature,
but his kris glanced harmlessly off it, and
its grip did not slacken for a moment. Then
it flung him suddenly backwards on to the
ground, where its gigantic fingers kept him
pinned in foaming impotence. The crowd
of phantoms flowed in on him. Ilis mouth
filled with dust, his kris was kicked out
of his hand, and while the grasp of his
fantastic adversary kept his head in chan-
cery, his writhing limbs were fastened on
by eager executioners, like a swarm of ants
clinging to a fallen moth. Gradually his
struggles grew weaker, and-presently ceased
altogether. The two men who had caught
him in the cliangkok, the pronged pole which
is kept in'every village for the capturing of
mad dogs and jealous husbands, relaxed their
hold. "Keep back,” they said, “lie belongs
to the Government now.” A woman in the
crowd begged for the heart of the dead man,
or at least some hairs from his head, to put
in her child’s rice: for Fa’ Bakea had died
like a brave man, and his wife had certainly
wronged him.
* * * *
Skreen got his stolen lugger back, after
two visits to Java and months of litigation,
but he did not recover his crew, because
Dutch law does not extradite dead men.
Who the pretty native woman with the kris
wound in her chest was who was also found
aboard his boat, with her little hands clutched
round the spokes of the wheel, he did not
have the curiosity to try to discover. It
required several trips to Kampong Tratas
and numerous presents to the Pa’ tinggi
before I got the story of Pa’ Bakea’s amok ;
but there were no lips left to tell the story
cif what happened on the lugger.
M. G. SKIPPER.
Justice in New Guinea.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Til! HE scene is a court-room in the capital
of a tropical colony, a sweltering
little seaport on the Pacific. It is
8.30 a.m., and already very hot. A stairway
leads down from the long, deep verandah to
the street. At the top is a guard of native
police. They are muscular-looking and stolid
as policemen should be. All are jet black,
contrasting with the light brown of most of
the other natives. They have rifles, red-
oeaked caps and spotless white leather-belts.
That is their only clothing save black calico
loincloths with scalloped red fringes, rather
like an abbreviated form of ballet-girl’s skirt.
Their anointed flesh shines like polished
ebony. Their lips are parted in benevolent
but slightly patronising smiles. They stand
very straight, and look as if they owned the
earth.
The colored population believes they do.. A
good deal of it is there squatting on its
haunches about the foot of the verandah-
steps, or collected in chattering groups, drawn
by curiosity, sniffing the smell of drama, even
as its betters do. The chatterers are ser-
vants or work-boys, obviously superior per-
sons, city dwellers, civilised men. They
are distinguished by their new, clean loin-
cloths and their air of swaggering import-
ance.
But those that sit by the steps are silent
and disconsolate-looking. Their loincloths
are tattered and filthy. Their frizzv hair
is matted and unkempt, and their skins are
discolored and rough with the sweat of travel.
They have come from the inland hills. Pro-
bably they did their 20 miles yesterday.
There has been a police round-up, as the
result of some recent murders, and they are
the witnesses. They have never been to a
court before. In fact, most of them have
not the remotest idea what a court is. They
are bewildered and not a little frightened.
Perhaps they will be hanged. The white
men do that sort of thing every now and
again ; nobody knows why. Or perhaps they
will be signed on. as laborers and made to
work on the plantations. Or maybe—a fate
at once glorious and terrible —they may be-
come police-boys. But everything is very
vague and unsettling, and most of the chances
are unpleasant. They wish they had not
left home.
They will not, anyhow, be hanged. The
five _ gentlemen who are menaced with that
distinction have just been escorted inside by
the guard.
It seems at first sight a bit too slack and
easy-going for an efficient court-room. There
are no wigs or gowns, and everybody is
dressed quite simply in white duck, except
those who are dressed more simply still
—like Adam, but with calico fig-leaves.
There is a small, fat Judge behind a high
bench, bald, deaf and perspiring. He has
an indefinable air of having just breakfasted.
The court secretary, with an effect of in-
ferior but still considerable dignity, is seated
at a little table on the floor directly in front
of the raised bench, facing the room. He
spends most of his time being whispered to
by three or four people at a time, which
gives him the appearance of being- the most
important person in the room. Except the
police-boys, of course. Nobody could pos-
sibly look more important than a police-boy.
Other white men sit at similar small tables,
and the body of the court is filled with
benches for the general public. These are
occupied by one or two white men in front
and a sprinkling of Malays and Chinese at
the rear. The few natives in the room stand
at the back of the benches, being forbidden
to sit.
One of the white men near the court sec-
retary is addressing the Judge. But instead
of standing up and moving his arms he re-
mains seated, and emphasises his points by
crossing and uncrossing his legs. Occasion-
ally one of the other white men interjects.
They all seem quite amiable about it, and
a trifle bored.
In the open space before the bench stand
five natives. Their tense, awkward attitudes
contrast strangely with the lassitude of the
white men. They are the prisoners. At
each end of the line Authority in a ballet-
skirt stands rigidly at attention. The five
shift uneasily from one leg to the other, and
are perplexed by the problem of what to do
with their hands. They are an undersized,
ill-fed lot, like most hill natives. Three of
them have open sores on their arms and legs,
freshly bandaged by the police-master, a white
man who stands a little apart, near the pro-
secutor. Two are covered with ringworm
from top to toe. The one next the police-hoy,
on the right, is older than the rest, and in the
intervals of scratching himself-seems to show
more curiosity than his companions, who wear
a stupefied look. The whole line rather
suggests a dilapidated fence sagging between
two posts.
The Judge stops writing and looks up. The
court secretary catches his eye and calls for
silence. The trial begins.
The case concerns the fate of six natives,
plantation laborers, who deserted and tried
to make their way home across the hills.
They came to a strange village and stopped
the night. Next morning their hosts escorted
them into the forest and killed them. To this
charge the five prisoners are called upon to
plead.
Number One suddenly takes one pace
forward, as the result of a prod from the
watchful police-boy.
“Call ’im name belong you!” commands the
court secretary.
The native lifts up two bleary eyes, and
emits an inquiring grunt. The question is
repeated. Another grunt, in a higher key, as
if the grunter were ever so little bored. Then
the police-hoy comes to the rescue : “This fella
man he bush txanaka, master: he no savvy
talk!”
Deadlock number one! There is whisper-
ing and gesticulation amongst the officials,
and presently the police-master produces an-
other native from the back of the room. He
is a tribesfellow of the prisoner’s, and can
speak pidgin English. He has obviously lost
his bearings, and after a despairing look all
round the room he marches up and forms in
line with the five prisoners, the only faces in
the room that appear to him to be really
human. Laughter in court. He is dis-
entangled by a police-boy and planted in the
proper position. He tells his name and vil-
lage, admits that he “savvies the talk” of the
prisoners, and is cautioned to interpret truly.
Then the ritual commences again. "You
speak: ‘Call ’im name belong you!’” The
interpreter turns to Number One and ex-
plodes gutturally. “To Vailo!” says Num-
ber One in a tired voice. “He speak name
belong him To Vailo.” The Judge writes it
down. “What name place belong him?” The
name of the man’s village filters through.
The Judge writes it down. Then the court
secretary gets down to tin tacks. “You kill
’im this six fella man five fella moon before,
along place belong you?” This is too much
for the interpreter, who is still nervous on
his own account, and he bursts out without
consulting the prisoner : “No, master, me no
kill ’im ! True talk on top! Me no savvy
talk lie! Me no kill ’im six fella man!” This
upsets the police boy, who grunts in his ear,
sotto vocc "Ah, God damn ! You blanky fool
too much. You no savvy bush Kanaka!”
fhe Judge does not write this down. All
J^ ar R> of course, but pretend otherwise,
Die police-master prods the officious police-
toy in the ribs and hisses, "Shut up, you
damn tool . The court secretary explains
to the interpreter that he is not accused of
anything for the present, and that if he does
" hat he is told lie may go home when the
ease 18 oyer, irrespective of what happens
t? the prisoners. The interpreter heaves a
sigh ot relief, and says he savvies. Then
“ e . turns to Number One again. They wrestle
with gutturals. Finally the prisoner noils
his head and gives a new kind of grunt. The
interpreter beams. “He speak: 'Yes, me
hill im six fella finish.’ ” There is a plu-
perfect touch about the last word that puts
argument out of. the question. The Judge
writes: "Pleads guilty.”
The same performance is gone through
with the other prisoners. All plead guilty.
Then the evidence is taken, just to make
sure, and the Judge sentences them. Not
to death. Murder is too customary among
savages for the extreme penalty to be in-
uicted very often. They get five years’ penal
servitude apiece and look decidedly relieved
at the news.
It is nearly 12 o’clock. Everybody is per-
spiring ; even the interpreter has lost a little
of liis zest. The Judge has long since ceased
to look as if he had just breakfasted. He
now looks as if he has not yet had lunch,
Evidently he feels that way, too, for he says
he will adjourn now until 2 o’clock. He does
adjourn. Everybody else adjourns. The
five prisoners are led away to begin then-
period of expiation.

Green traveller waters that with eddying
pride
March on forever round this sandstone
wall,
What memories throng your passing ! Shoal
hells call
Out of cold mists, and rotting timbers glide
With tattered canvas where the northern tide
Runs harsh with ice. Warm rivers stream-

Through tropic wildernesses and the tall
Black masts between the tall black chimneys
ride.
You have been long upon your dancing way
From Cytliera, bright wave with streaky

Making a bubbling mirth across the morn.
Did the Great Queen one rosy shoulder lay
Upon your curving pillow while the rain
Of flying foam laughed for sweet love sea-
