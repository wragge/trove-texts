Big-Australian Verse
KIDS.
Hi, there, Tommy, get your rifle! Yes, we
know you're small a trifle,
But you've got to leave your marbles, and
must learn to hump u gun.
While your Dad is at the races, backing
”stiffened” mokes for places,
You must learn to be a soldier —Shoulder
arms! Step lively! ’Shun!
Brother Bill is playing cricket; ivhilc he’s
busy at the wicket.
While he’s fooling round in flannels, you
must learn to be a Man;
You’re Australia’s sole defender, though
you're weak and mighty tender,
You must hump Australia's burden — that’s
this nation’s splendid plan!
Uncle Jim is pigeon shooting, brother Jack
is football-rooting —
Hear the cheering and the jeering, whilst
you learn your bit of drill.
There’s a row that calls for hoeing; whilst
the "half-time” beers ure flowing,
You are "forming fours” and marching—
hear the umpire's whistle shrill!
Brother Bill is bravely batting, making runs
along the matting;
Dad is cursing mokes and bookies, tearing
tickets as he goes ;
Whilst the slaughtered pigeons flatter o’er
the jerking trap and shutter —
You alone are getting ready for to-morrow’s
certain foes!
Bill the mighty, Bill the hero, seems to me
to slump to zero —
You’re the only Alan Who Matters, though
you’re very small and young;
In these days when peace grows brittle,
march the soldiers extra-little —
And l reckon brother William might as
well be drowned or hung!
Uncle Jim the pigeon-shooter, brother Jack
. the football-rooter —
They’re a pair of service-dodgers, ne’er a
drill prescribed for them ;
Also, Dad. the pony-backer, he’s a useless
sort of slacker,
You’re the only White Australian on the
nation’s job pro tern.!
Etc.
There is no doubt about Grant Ilervey
being a Big Australian. He tells us so
Himself. We agree with Him that his
purple Volume, Australians Yet, consists of
“ballads of Manhood, Work. Good Cheer,
Mates hip, Masculine Vigor and Nationalism ;
but sometimes we wish that He
wouldn’t keep telling us they Are. He gives
us the Impression that He is so Busy ex-
horting us to Work that He Hasn't Time
to Get Work Himself; that He is so re-
sonantly Cheering us Up. so eagerly enroll-
ing us among his Mates, so strenuously
pumping into us Masculine Vigor and
Nationalism that He can’t have An Ounce
of these valuable Commodities left in his
Big Australian Self. And that would be Sad.
“We'll be Australians yet!” He Yells.
Well, we are. But perhaps we forget that
if it hadn’t been for the Grant Herveys this
Commonwealth wouldn't have been so pre-
ponderantly populated with Australians.
His Editorials in Verse have served a valu-
able and patriotic Purpose; and if He has
had to Shriek, and Shriek continuously on
One Note, it is because we were so Hard of
Hearing. Luckily. Grant Hervey knows
His own Value. He “asnires” to be Aus-
tralia’s “chiefest singer,” and;
Whene'er I see a chariot go speeding near or
far,
I yearn to grasp life's lariat—to stand upon
a star!....
The harness would be furnished bright—to
match the flashing car —
With wheels a-hum and furnished right I’d
drive Australia!... .
I long to mount this Chariot and thunder
over Icings —
To trample each Iscariot and slag all Judas
things!
To overturn Autocracg—to break it with
my wheels —
To steer thy ships. Democracy, 'mid battle’s
thunder-peals !
To stand upon the Decks of Things—to
boss a bolting star —
To sway the heads—the necks of things:
Such My Ambitions ARE!
A worthy ambition. But then, “God’s
Master-Voice commands my soul” :
It is llis Voice which strengthens me,
As with the strength of rampart-hills;
And I march on to victory
With twice 10,000 Ceasar-wills ... .
It bids me grip Australia’s sword,
And be Her champion for ayej
That she perchance may call me Lord —
And lift Her mouth to mine One Day!
But let us not be Shocked. When Grant
Hervey sings That Way, it is only because
He identities Himself with Australia, and
in Boosting Himself he is Boosting Aus-
tralia.
And a Bard who has written the Fiercest
Line in Literature demands our considera-
tion. This is The Line:—
Damn! Damn! ! Damn! ! ! Damn! !! !
And, despite his Rodomontade, Grant
Hervey is “Some” Poet. Turgid, Over-
stressed, and Over-Capitalised as his verse
is, it is good, robust \ r erse. “Five Years,”
“When the Doctor Will Not Come,”
“Among the Thieves,” and “When a Fellow
Does his Damnedest,” express various
phases of Australian life with a vigor and
an earnestness that it is difficult to match.
And he finds his inspiration in patriotic
subjects such as these: “The Coal Ships”;
the ships that never come to Portland Bay;
Walkers. Limited, of Maryborough, who
make ' locomotives; Shell (Broome ) ;
“Another Fall of Earth” ; and he has a
psalm “for the Army in Blue Dungarees.”
And there is a fine, friendly humor in much
of His Verses—things like “Among the
Thieves” and "Ballad of the Man Far In-
land.” After all, it is when Grant Hervey
forgets His Patriotic Mission and becomes
a Mere Bard that he achieves His finest
efforts. Quite another Grant Hervey—and
a greater Grant Hervey—could have been
discovered in this Volume if the critic had
passed over his patriotic Hysterics and lis-
tened for the still, small Voice behind the
Booming of the Big Australian Drum.
Things like these :
The explorers are forgotten — ay, the bones
of some are rotten —
But one breathes their strength and spirit in
the wild Westralian airj
There’s something half-immortal that West-
ralia throws athwart all —
There’s a something more than mirage in the
dawn’s red-shrouded glare....
All night the stars have sped across
The paddock-lands of sky;
With shining eyes and manes a-toss
They stvung in squadrons by... .
Stevedores and sailor-men,
Greaser-folk and whaler-men —
These, good Lord, go heftily, nor fret about
their souls!
These , with steam and sturdiness.
Whilst parsons rage in tooi'diness.
Go back and forth incessantly betwixt their
ocean-goals.
And :
I heard Jehovah singing in a proud, ex-
ultant key—
“ When a Fellow Does His Damnedest, it is
homage unto Me!”
A book, crude, sincere, strenuous, stimu-
lating for all Big Australians.

The Eldest Son of Queen Elizabeth
If Isabella S. Nicholls, of Mosman, had
only gone on aS she had begun, her book,
The Eldest Son of Queen Elizabeth (Angus
and Robertson), would have been a master-
piece. But it is not in mortals to retain
the level of her superb title. Still, Isabella
S. Nicholls, of Mosman, does her best. This
modest volume “proves” that Francis Bacon
not only wrote the plays accredited to a
mere actor named Shakespeare—other people
have done that: people with names like
Ignatius Donnelly and Mrs. Gallup, and
anything could be proved by a person named
Mrs. Gallup—but that he was the eldest of
Queen Elizabeth’s presumably large family,
and therefore the rightful heir to the throne.
This, in itself, would have been sufficient to
arouse our faint interest; but we also learn
that in addition Bacon wrote Spenser’s
Faerie Queene , Montaigne’s Essays, and
edited much of the English Bible of 1611.
If she could only have “proved” that Bacon
wrote the Bible, we would have been satis-
fied. We have always suspected that Mr.
Deuteronomy was not the author of the book
to which he signed his name. As far as we
know, that gentleman had neither the educa-
tion nor the ability to write such a work.
However, doubtless some investigator will
discover a Baconian cypher that will settle
this important point.
. What happened was this. Elizabeth,
while a prisoner in the Tower during Mary’s
reign, married Sir Robert Dudley, a fellow
prisoner. Francis Bacon was the first issue of
this marriage. Elizabeth, when Queen, could
not recognise him as her eldest born, but
showered honors and other marks of her
motherly affection upon him. Francis re-
fused to claim his position as heir to the
throne, as this would doubtless have annoyed
his mother, who had decided to go down
in history as “The Virgin Queen.”
There was, therefore, nothing else for
Francis, baulked of his ambition, to
do but to write The Faerie Qaeene, Mon-
taigne’s Essays, Shakespeare’s Works, his
own acknowledged Essays, and edit as much
of the Bible as he could find time for. Eliza-
beth, his mother, we are told, w r ould not
allow him to disclose himself as the author
of what Isabella S. Nicholls calls “the
most marvellous literary works of all time.”
Hence he contented himself by filling his
writings with cyphers, from which all these
facts can be recovered. Isabella S. Nicholls
has merely summed up the conclusions ar-
rived at by previous cypher-discoverers and
Baconians: she has mercifully refrained
from discovering a new cypher of her own :
and with such phrases as “we presume,”
“it is probable,” “possibly,” “it was whis-
pered in Court,” "we surmise,” “without
doubt,” etc., she makes out a plausible
hypothesis for her tremendous claim. The
trouble is that so many other investigators
have founded so many other theories with
regard to Shakespeare’s works that the
claims of Baconians have become mutually
contradictory. Isabella A. Nicholls merely
lumps all the claims together: Elizabethan
research is obviously impossible in Mosman.
One wonders why it has never occurred to
theorists to “discover” that Elizabeth wrote
Shakespeare. _ However, The Eldest Son of
Q. Elizabeth is really an interesting synopsis
of the outstanding points of the Baconian
thesis, and as such is commended to Shake-
speare societies and Memorial Ter-centenary
committees.
Ihe one fatal objection to the vast array
of inferences favoring Baconian authorship,
and one that cannot be explained away by
any cypher, is that only a dramatist with a
thorough technical knowledge of the theatre
could have written Elizabethan drama; and
there is no evidence that Bacon had or could
apply that technique. The whole con-
troversy has arisen simply because the aver-
age Mrs. Gallup cannot conceive how such
remarkable dramas could have been written
by a man so little remarked, forgetting that
there is extant no biographv of Homer
Writing Plays
Arnold Bennett, in The English Review
for July, talks sense about stagecraft:—
I have written or collaborated in about
20 novels and about 20 plays, and I am
convinced that it is easier to write a plaj
than a novel. Whereas established novelists
not infrequently venture into the theatre
with audacity, established dramatists are
very cautious indeed about quitting the
theatre. An established dramatist usually
takes good care to write plays and naught
else.... therein his instinct is quite pro-
perly that of self-preservation. Of manj
established dramatists all over the world it
niai be affirmed that if they were so in-
discieet as to publish a novel, the resull
would be a great shattering and a greal
awakening.. . .
No technique is so crude and so simple
as the technique of the stage, and the proper
place to learn it is not behind the scenes,
but in the pit. ...
There are some seven situations in the
customary drama, and a play which does
not contain at least one of these situations
in each act will be condemned by
as undramatic,” or ‘-thin,” or as being “all
talk Thus every truly original play is
bound to be indicted for bad technique. The
author is bound to be told that what he has
written may be marvellously clever, but
that it is not a play 1 tremble to think
what the mandarins and William Archer
would say to the technique of Hamlet, could
it by some miracle be brought forward as a
new piece by a Mr. Shakespeare....
One reason why a play is easier to write
than a novel is that a play is shorter than
a novel. On the average, it takes six plavs
to make the matter of a novel. Other things
being equal, a short work of art presents
tewer difficulties than a longer one. The
contrary is held true by the majority, but
then the majority, having never attempted
to produce a long work of art, are unquali-
fied to offer an opinion. . ..
A play is further simplified by the fact
that it contains fewer kinds of matter, and
less subtle kinds of matter. There are
numerous delicate and difficult affairs of
cratt that the dramatist need not think
about at all. If he attempts to go beyond a
certain mild degree of subtlety, he is merely
wasting his time. What passes for subtle
on the stage would have a very obvious air
in a npvel, as some dramatists* have unhap-
pily discovered. Thus whole continents of
danger may be shunned by the dramatist,
and instead of being scorned for his coward-
ice he will be very rightly applauded for
Ins artistic discretion. Again, he need not
—indeed,_ he must not —save in a primitive
and hinting manner, concern himself with
atmosphere.” He may roughlv suggest one
but if lie begins on the feat of “creating”
an atmosphere, the last suburban train will
have departed before he reaches the crisis
of the play. The last suburban train is the

the stage—an experienced, conscientious
and perhaps lovely actress will strive W
hardest to prove that the dramatist
right about Millicent’s astounding
eiuation.. . .
The apparent differences between the
novel and the play are superficial.. Everv
thing basic that applies to the technique of
the novel applies equally to the techniaiiJ
ot the play....
We have grown very ingenious and clever
at the trickery of making characters talk
to the audience aud explain themselves and
their past history while seemingly innocent
of any such intention. Here the* dramatist
has to face a difficulty special to himself
which the novelist can avoid. That the
difficulty is not acute is proved by the ease
with which third-class dramatists have
generally vanquished it....
The fundamental difference between the
play and the novel is: The emotional strain
of writing a play is not merely less pro-
longed than that of writing a novel—it is
less severe while it lasts, lower in degree
and of a less purely creative character. That
is the chief of all reasons why a play is
easier to write than a novel. The drama
does not belong exclusively to literature,
because its effect depends on something more
than the composition of words. The drama-
tist is the sole author of a play, but he is
not the sole creator of it. He begins the
work of creation, which is finished by crea-
tive interpreters on the stage. A play is a
collaboration of creative faculties—not only
those of the author, the producer and the
actors —the audience itself is unconsciously
part of the collaboration. . ..
The manager reads the play, and to the
dramatist’s astonishment, reads quite a dif-
ferent play from that which the dramatist
imagines he wrote. In particular the
manager reads a play against whose
chances of success 10.000 powerful reasons
eau be adduced The manager’s pro-
foundest instinct —self-preservation again—
is to refuse a play; if he accepts, it is
against his grain, against his judgment—
and out of some mad spirit of adventure
The manager’s true and only vocation is to
refraiu from producing plays. Despite all
this, however, the manager has already
collaborated in the play. The dramatist
sees it differently now. All sorts of new
considerations have been presented to him.
Not a word has been altered; but it
noticeably another play.... And when the
producer has his first serious confabulation
with the author, then at once the play be-
gins to assume new shapes... .Before the
first rehearsal is called, the play, still with-
out a word altered, has gone through as-
tounding creative transmutations As the
rehearsals proceed the play changes from
day to day... .Producer and actors do not
merely suggest possibilities, they execute
them.... And the dramatist, after the dress-
rehearsal. reflects stoically, fatalistically:
“Well, that is the play they have made of
my play!” And he may be pleased or he
may be disgusted. But if he attends the
first performance he cannot fail to notice,
after the first few minutes of it. that he
was quite mistaken, and that what the
actors are performing- is still another play.
The audience is collaborating.
The Fortnightly for July is paramountly
a stage number. It includes an incisive
and almost Shavianly brilliant analy-
sis of the dramatic craftsmanship of
Bernard Shaw (by P. P. Howe), W. L
Courtney’s third article on Realistic
Drama, and articles upon “Intellect and the
Actor,” A Vagner, and the French Stage.
The Play of To-Day, studies in play-struc-
ture for the student and the theatre-goer,
by Elizabeth R. Hunt (Lane, ner Dymocks
Library), is endorsed by The Drama League
of America—a useful organisation whose aim
is to extend the field and the knowledge ot
the best drama in the United States. In e
Drama League ought to have known better,
for the book is merely for the kindergarten
class of theatre-goers, and it is written in
atrocious English—or, maybe, in good
American. In her analyses of various modern
plays, she rather interestingly shows how.
from, say, the plot of a .comedy like Lady
Windermere's Fan, almost any other sort ot
play might be written. By looking at the
facts of the plot from a slightly different
angle, this play could have become a traged.v>
a farce, a sex-play, a problem-play or a melo-
drama. The present writer has often
thought that Hamlet could be easily re-
written as a melodrama or a farce. In fact’
he is not quite sure whether Shakespeare did
not mean it to be a musical comedy.

Your Dealer’s Knowledge
of Arms
YOU look to your dealer to be at least well
informed on guns of all makes* And you
are a little more confident that he can
aid you in choosing the right shot-gun or rifle
when you see the more modern arms displayed
in his showcase or window*
Sportsmen and dealers all over Australia
have been quick to recognise the thoroughbred in
the new Remington-UMC repeating arm.
Your eye, too, will choose it instinctively for
its clean, trim lines —its suggestion of all-round
shooting ability*
The pleasing outline of the Remington-UMC
shot-gun or rifle is the result of an effort to secure
a safer arm. The protruding hammer, for one
thing, has been eliminated and the breech
completely closed*
We will be glad to send a booklet explaining simply
why these technical features are of vital importance to
you in your choice of an arm. Your name and address
on a post-card will bring it by return mail.

A Picture of
Good Health!
Mrs. ADDINGTON, of Argent Street, Broken
Ilill, writes her daughter was cured of St. Vitus’s
Dance, and is NOW IN SPLENDID HEALTH
through CLEMENTS TONIC.
“Argent Street, North Broken Hill,
"10th October, 1911.
"C LEMENTS TONIC LTD.
"Some years ago my daughter, in alighting from
a tram, had a severe fall. It gave her a great
shock, and so affected her nervous system that
eventually St. Vitus’s Dance ensued. She became
so bad that it was impossible to hold a knife or
fork, and going out of the house was impossible.
“T was persuaded to try CLEMENTS TONIC. She gradually improved, and
soon regained her normal condition. Nearly two years have elapsed SINCE HER
COMPLETE RECOVERY, and all that time she has enjoyed the best of health.
“I have great faith in CLEMENTS TONIC, and always recommend it. You
can make what use you wish of this.
“(Signed) (Mrs.) R. A. ADDINGTON.”
CLEMENTS TONIC is Your MEDICINE
The Rev. JOHN HOSKIXG. D.D., Minister of
the Congregational Church, Fitzroy, Melbourne,
writes: —
“I was completely run down and suffered by
nervous prostration, being troubled with Insomnia
and nervous headaches.
“After taking one bottle I slept soundly, and soon
got stronger. One bottle put me right, and w r as
worth its weight in gold. I recommend this medi-
cine very strongly. You may use this as you think
fit.
“(Signed) JOHN HOSIvING, D.D. - ’
This Testimony should convince anyone suffering
from INSOMNIA or LOSS OF SLEEP and
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN, of the value of this
curative medicine.

Do You Want to
be Rid of Your
VARICOSE VEINS?
THIS APPEAL is made direct to you because from our experience we know that
thousands of people have suffered the tortures of the damned from varicose veins
and ulcers because they did not know there was a painless cure for this disastrous
complaint. Did you know that there really is a certain and lasting cure?
Owing to the failure of ordinary methods to overcome this trouble, the lay-
man has come to believe that no cure exists for the trouble—a belief that was
founded on fact until four years ago. THE VECSEY METHOD OF HOME TREAT-
MENT has made possible the absolute cure of varicose veins and ulcers without
operation or laying up. It is a purely home method, simple and efficacious. It is
perfectly harmless and painless. In fact, in those cases where the sufferer has
been incapacitated for days by pain, the treatment afforded almost instant relief.
Mr. G. Vecssy.
Ulcers that have been open sores for years have entirely disappeared under a few weeks’ treatment. 8

Tobacco
Kills!

MOST MEN would
cure themselves of
the Tobacco Habit if
they knew they could
do so easily and also
without causing
themselves discom-
fort. ... It takes but
ten minutes for To-
bacco to change the
beats of the heart.
To keep it up is to
tempt death by heart
disease, nervous col-
lapse, tobacco cancer
and stomach, liver or
kidney disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harm-
less, vegetable remedy that will make the
user of tobacco in any form absolutely aban-
don the habit for good. It not destroys the
craving, the desire, the appetite for tobacco,
but restores to health the entire nervous sys-
tem, and aids Nature in entirely eliminating
from the system the Nicotine Poison of
Tobacco.

The Ruin.
The place is all a ruin now,
No longer weatherproof;
The rain falls and the wild winds blow
On its broken walls and roof.
And where is he, the dweller, gone—-
The gay, the debonair?
A wind sighs at the fall of night,
And ever ’tis asking, “Where?”
The house was built for lasting use,
And 10, ’tis down and doomed !
I know the month its walls were raised —-
It was when the roses bloomed.
Who wrecked its roof- —pulled stone from
stone ?
And whence, O whence came he?
I name no name—perchance ’twas Pride,
Or, perchance, ’twas Perfidy.
builders built like singing birds
When mating time is come,
And spring cries “Hush” to all the trees,
And the charmed trees are dumb.
O sweet, O sweet, O thrilling sweet,
O wild and unrestrained !
The song to which the house was raised
In the month the roses reigned.
They said; “Herein shall he abide
To whom this house belongs,
With scent from out the heart o’ flowers
And the sweetest of sweet songs.”
A little while of rose and rhvme....
And then the wrecker came-—-
The grey rain streaming through the dark,
Or the wind, may know his name.
Grim spectres move along the walls,
And ancient memories stir;
But Love, for whom that house was built,
Is a homeless wanderer.
N.S.W.
RODERIC QUINN.
Her Hour.
In the gilded room that night
There was passion, there was flame ;
There were music, wine and light
And an exquisite young dame ;
There were statues white and glowing—
Marble nymphs in varied poses ;
And, through open casements blowing,
Fragrant odors born of roses.
To the marble shapes akin
That appeared to dance and float,
Gleamed the young dame’s satin skin
And the curving of her throat.
Yet if all the pale pearls gleaming—-
On her rounded bosom sitting—
Had become red rubies beaming
With hot lustres, ’twere but fitting.
For her small, sweet, scarlet mouth
Passion-parched with all desire.
Like an orchid of the south
Was as velvet and as fire;
In the ripe, voluptuous splendor
Of her beauty men stood muted,
As though in soul-surrender
To some air divinely luted.
Through the casement fitful, warm,
With rose-odors on its breast,
Came a wind that told of storm
And red lightnings in the west;
Yet the far sounds fell unheeded
On the young dame joy-pursuing;
And her ravished ears conceded
Nought to what the night was doing.
So she moved with lights above
In the semblance of gold fruit;
And her dreams were all of love
And of beauty absolute,
And of lovers crazed with wonder,
And of triumph-times thereafter....
Then a sound rolled. .. .was it thunder
Or a god’s ironic laughter?
N.s.w.
RODERIC QUINN.
The Off-Shore Wind.
I sniffed it coming through the Straits
Where debp-sea rollers break in foam.
And currents fret the limestone gates—
The wind that calls the traveller home.
It bore the vagrant, faint perfume,
Mixed with the saltness of the sea,
Of eucalypt and wattle-bloom ;
All like a message blown to me.
Like words that chanted. “Wherefore seek
Elusive joys on alien strands?
What dome more grand than granite peak—
What scene more bright than flowery
lands?
I give you sweetness undefiled,
Beyond all art in eloquence;
The native music of the wild :
A potent charm for every sense!”
Ah. cloistered aisles and daisied turf
Of that old world I wooed so long.
Still feudal of the lord and serf;
My ears grew dulled to sweeter song!
But now the air that blows to me
Brings back the deeper-drawn romance—
The glories of the stars and sea,
The splendors of the land’s expanse!
Ah. paven ways and solemn fanes.
And arrogance of wealth and pride—
I smell once more the magic rains
That wake new beauties far and wide!
And T forswear, without regret,
The grandeurs of the older land—
Cathedral, bourse and minaret.
From London down to Samarkand !
Good welcome at the wave-worn gates,
Where deep-sea rollers break in foam.
Brings this sweet wind adown the straits;
With scented messages from home.
Like words that chant. “Why journey far
Baking the planet’s length and girth?
Here is the sunbeam and the star.
And all the glorv of the earth !”

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the hditor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
it is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin/” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

THE MIDDLEMAN.
When the stereotyped politician of the hour
is out trying to put salt on the tail of the
elusive vote, there are three matters which
he must by no possibility neglect to mention.
They are (1) the high cost of living; (2)
the necessity for encouraging the primary
producer; and (3) the need to eliminate the
middleman. State Premier Holman, of
N.S.W., got all three remarks off his vest
on one recent day—the same day that
the Fair Rent Bill was introduced
in the Assembly—and he expended much
loose eloquence upon them to little
purpose. The middleman is, of course, an old
grievance. Also, if you find the right
middleman, he is a very real grievance.
There is an appalling amount of waste in
the ways of modern civilisation. All man-
ner of needless whisperers intrude them-
selves between the man who has goods to
sell and the one who has a need for these
goods, and they annex a percentage, after
the manner of a baronial bushranger of the
Rhine in the Middle Ages. Certainly there are
necessary middlemen—in fact, some people
of that sort are essential to civilisation. If
Premier llolman had to go personally to
(say i Cairns to buy his sugar, and go per-
sonally to the cow country of Illawarra to
buy his butter, he would have very little time
to follow any money-making avocation of his
own, such as the legal job of being a middle-
man in the court between plaintiff and
jury. Put the unnecessary middleman—the
jobber and robber, who exists, not because
society requires him, but because he has dis-
covered a way of plundering society—has
multiplied to an outrageous extent. ' And
the man who declares war on him does a ser-
vice to the community.
* * * *
As a case in point, consider that curled
darling of the Freetrade person (such as
Holman) —the importer. The Freetrader is
a whale for foreign commerce. He holds
that Freetrade Britain is the greatest coun-
try on earth, because it has such a stupen-
dous foreign commerce. Foreign commerce
« art and mystery of sending wheat
from Parkes (N.S.W.) at great cost to
Northampton (England), and selling it
there, and buying boots at Northampton
(England) with the money, and bringing the
boots out at great cost to Parkes (N.S.W.).
That involves much railway charge both in
N.S.W. and in England, and much steamship
freight in between, and the employment of
many railway servants, steamship employees,
bank clerks (who fix up matters of ex-
change and so on), exporting agents (who
finance the farmer while he is waiting for
his returns), importers (who bring back the
boots and charge a big profit on them), and
other intermediaries. Of these the greatest
and richest is the importer. He makes no-
thing ; he invents nothing; he teaches
nothing. Also, he pays his employees
badly, and encourages them to wear
tail . coats and belitoppers. He is a
consistent enemy of the industries of
the country in which he lives, because, as
these industries grow, he becomes more and
more superfluous, and the bottom tends to
fall out of his easy, useless, loafing, para-
sitic job. Being a rich man. with much
good advertising to give away, he is natur-
ally valued by the Tory press, and that
press exalts foreign commerce as the one
sure test of a nation’s greatness. Yet, as
already mentioned, commerce consists very
largely in sending needless wheat at great
cost, both in travellirg expenses and middle-
men's commissions, from Parkes (N.S.W.)
to Northampton■ (England), and bringing
back needless boots, at much travelling
cost and much middlemen’s commission,
7™” ,N°, rthain P ton (England), to Parkes
(N.S.W.). If the boot factory was at
Parkes (N.S.W.), and the amount of wheat
which the local farmer was desirous of swap-
ping for boots could be ground and sold
locally, there would be several thousand
less middlemen —marine insurance men, bank
managers and clerks and shareholders, ship-
owners, shipbuilders, ships’ officers and
crews, railway men at this end, carrying the
wheat to the coast and bringing back the
boots, railway men at the other end taking
the wheat inland and carrying the boots to
the coast, exporting agents with their em-
ployees and office rents and taxes and ad-
vertising costs, importers with their em-
ployees and rents and taxes and advertising
costs —all these middlemen who now take a
bite out of this particular wheat and these
especial boots would be eliminated.
Certainly there would be a falling-off in
commerce, and the import and export figures
would, be less imposing, and the rich people
who live on commerce would hire the Tory
press to state that the country was plainly
going to the dogs. But in those cases where
commerce is a costly and superfluous drag-
ging of things over the face of the earth, it
isn tan asset but a disease. Certainly there
have been wonderful commercial or bagman
States, like old Genoa or old Venice, which
rose to greatness on their trade. But Venice
(and in a rather less degree, Genoa) was a
city State, with hardly any land to grow
vegetables on, with no mines—with no
assets, in fact, save its enterprise and its
ships and its harbor. So it set itself to
buy goods and to sell goods, and to
carry goods for other people in its
own ships, and to charge the other
people the highest possible price for the
work. Australia’s commerce, on the other
hand., consists mostly of paying other people
the highest possible price for needlessly drag-
ging its goods over the face of the' globe.
Venice was the importing and exporting
middleman and ate other people, while Aus-
tralia is eaten by the middleman. Venice
was the bookmaker who laid short odds,
while Australia is. the punter who backs the
horse that comes in last. The positions are
obviously different.
.When Premier Holman, in his craving to
eliminate the middleman, has decided to
throw all his influence, and to induce his
party to throw all its influence, into the
High Protection and immigration move-
ment. he might proceed to consider other
aspects of the case. The railways are very
costly middlemen. No matter "how much
Australia exerts itself to become indepen-
dent of the foreign manufacturer, it will,
for a long time to come, have a surplus of
produce for export. That surplus has to
pay tax to middlemen, quite apart from
bankers, exporting agents, commission
agents, and the other mercantile sundries.
Every needless mile that a bushel of wheat
travels it pays a needless tax to railway
station officials, railway maintenance meri,
engine-drivers, firemen, mihers who dig up
coal for the engine—in fact, the middleman
is eating at it all the time. The poliev
which aims at dragging all the export trade
of a State to one port, like Sydney or Mel-
bourne, instead of taking it to the nearest
deep-water port, brings quite a heap of
costly middlemen into the business. Cer-
tainly it tends to bloat the railway returns,
and the bloated railway returns look good
in the revenue accounts But it is difficult
to see that the superfluous engine-driver,
save for the fact that he may vote
the Labor ticket, does more good to the
country than the superfluous importer. The
foreign loan policy brings in another gang
of middlemen to consume Australia’s assets.
V hen an Australian Government borrows
locally it usually sells its stock at net price
over the. Treasury counter. The buyer
throws his money inwards, and the seller
throws the scrip outwards, and there is no
expense whatever. But in London, what
with stamp duty, commissions, underwriting
charges and sundries, something like ffl out
of every £lOO is devoured when the loan is
floated, and £3 more when it is renewed,
and another £3 when it is renewed again,
until the person who tries to follow the
course of high finance gets a giddy sensation
in the head. It is a remarkable fact, by the
way, that the Holman Government pro-
poses to bring an English firm into the loan-
floating and railway building business, and
to pay it 5 per cent, on money raised and
expended. This is a staggering addition to
the list of middlemen, and a surprising
development of Private Enterprise.
Incidentally, a good deal of needless
middle expense arises through the policy
which has planted the great bulk —in fact
almost the whole—of the manufactures of
the two most populous States in Sydney
and Melbourne. When (say) Bourke
(N.S.W.) sends produce to Sydney
(N.S.W.) in exchange for boots, it doesn’t
pay so many superfluous intermediaries as
if it did the transaction with Northampton
(England). Still, if the overcoat of the
local bullock was turned into boots in the
next street there would be fewer inter-
mediaries. But even with this draw-
back there is a heap to be said for local
manufacture, however congested it may be.
Thus there are in the Sydney furniture trade
a few firms like Beard, Watson & Co.,
Mark Foy and Anthony Hordern, who
make tables and chairs locally out of local
material, and sell them direct to the rash
young man named Smith who has £5O to
spare and a burning desire to take Ange-
lina Jones to his cheap bosom in a cottage
at Paddington. All the costs of dragging
raw material to England and dragging fin-
ished goods from England—all the shipping
charges, insurances, exchange, wholesalers’
profits, and retailers’ profits are eliminated,
and not one of the hundreds of middlemen
bites even an inch off one leg of young man
Smith’s kitchen table. Also the firms pay
Australian wages and are amenable to Aus-
tralian arbitration courts and wages boards.
Naturally, this kind of enterprise is abhor-
rent to the rich importer, and to his mul-
titudinous. parasites, and to the Tory papers
that are in his pay. If firms of the sort
described opened factories in every big coun-
try town, and spread into every important
branch of industry, and adhered to the
policy of cutting out everybody who inter-
feres between the maker and the consumer,
a whole multitude of dealers and traders
and jobbers would have to go rabbiting.
Then there would be fewer rabbits.
The elimination of the superfluous man-
m-the-centre is a large question, and if
Premier Holman feels like attacking it in
real earnest there is a life’s work ahead
of him. There is not very much to be
gained by assailing local banks and such-
like institutions so far as they serve purely
local purposes. They answer to a need by
assembling cash in one place so that the
borrower may find it, just as the grocer
assembles food in one place so that Holman
won’t have to go to Milton (N.S.W.) for
his butter and Cairns (N.Q.) for his sugar.
But the useless middlemen who are born of
the. Congestion policy and the importing
policy and the foreign-borrowing policy
could be cut out with no loss to anybody
save themselves, and very great gain to the
community at large.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Bulgarians and Drains.
The fact that the Bulgarians went mad in
their hour of defeat and became mere
slayers and torturers has discredited them
in the public mind and given the Unspeak-
able Turk a leg up —a reflected leg, so to
speak. People say that, after all, Abdul
Fez isn’t the only infuriated pebble on the
beach. But this is a wholly erroneous line
of reasoning. All manner of peoples—even
Frenchmen and Englishmen—have gone rav-
ing mad under great stress, and have accom-
plished very bad horrors, but when they
recovered they went home and made drains.
That is the great test of civilisation. Now
the Bulgarian makes drains. He has rebuilt
the old, mean Turkish village of Sofia, and
made it a capital and the beauty-city of
south-eastern Europe. It has wide streets,
tram-cars, parks, electric lighting, noble
buildings, a university of some standing, the
grandest theatre in south-eastern Europe, a
vast public library, a network of railways
and drains. The Turk may be no more
cruel than the Bulgar when he is roused,
but he never constructed an efficient drain
in his life. He has dogs, instead, to consume
the city garbage. Furthermore Abdul
doesn’t know how to run an hotel. Every
decent hotel in Turkdom is managed by a
Frenchman, German, Austrian or other
foreigner, and every decent native inn is
bossed by an Arab or Syrian or somebody
of the sort. The Turk doesn’t know how
to run a hospital. He operates without
chloroform, and his patients have a habit of
crawling out of bed at night and sleeping
in the yard to escape from the nocturnal
vermin. The mortality is something ter-
rible. Consequently foreigners club together
to run hospitals for the benefit of the
foreign population. Again, Abdul is a fail-
ure at running steamships. There' are good
British, Austrian and Italian vessels on his
coasts, and here and there a Turkish
steamer can be found. The guide-book
always explains briefly that the Turkish
steamer is very cheap, but that as a set-off
it is dirty, buggy, flea-y, and wholly irre-
gular in its time-table. Again, Abdul
doesn’t make roads. This writer has trav-
elled on the Crusaders’ roads in Palestine
on the old Roman and Greek roads on the
roads which the French built in Syria dur-
ing the blessed days of the Occupation, but
he has only travelled over one road built
wholly by -Turks, and he isn’t going there
any more. There are only two railways in
? iA B u UL £ e , m Pire that are wholly con-
trolled by Turks, and a train like a moving
garbage heap is scheduled to do about 14
miles an hour and generally does about 10
Many of Abdul s towns have no roads lead-
ing to them at all, and the noisome streets
are about six or eight or 10 feet wide. Many
, ® se towns don’t contain a single
wheeled vehicle—solely through lack of
space. The Turk takes French money with

to have doubts about his own legal “splosh ”
His country is overrun with foreign post-
offices—German French, Italian and so
—because no foreigner believes „ 0 oil

a great degree to keep Turkish women a!

folk. English people call the place Tufi
because it belongs to the Turks, just as thev
they might call it Monkey if it belonged
to monks, or Hunkey if it belonged to an
old hunks (which is a slang term for a
miser), or Jockey if it belonged to a Scotch
person called Jock, which is a Caledonian
form of John. The inhabitants don’t call
it anything in particular. A strangely
casual and cat-like affair is this land of the
unspeakable Turk. It spends the night on
the tiles in a fit of devotion, and comes
home with the milk in the morning to
slaughter a Christian. Its best army was
made up of kidnapped Christian infants
whose names and identities were wiped out
so that they wouldn’t know for certain what
country they belonged to. Its manufac-
tures, inherited from the Greeks, are decay-
ing. Its bankruptcies have been numerous
For many years Turkey has been a large
drunken, raving Saturday-night female,’
holding the centre of a slum street with a
dish-cloth in her hand, and occupying her
position, such as it was, by bluff and by
reason of the disagreements of her oppo-
nents. The Bulgarians, during the late
war, don’t seem to have been any more
humane than their hereditary enemies. But
the Bulgarians have possibilities and drains ,
while their hereditary enemies haven’t.
Drains make all the difference.
Insulting Language Regarded as a
Fine Art.
Consider, on the following evidence from
the Melbourne correspondent of the Sydney
Telegraph (22/8/’l3), the demented way
in which this vast continent is run:—
Mr. Rodgers. .. .should prove useful to his party.
Mr. . Patten is already getting sufficiently
familiar with the conduct of the proceed-
ings of Parliament to make his influence
on the Opposition felt. Mr. Falkiner has an
aggressive, outspoken style. But the member who
made the most impression was Mr. Fleming, who
has brought from New South Wales a torrential
fluency and a readiness of rejoinder on his opponents
that had the Opposition last night in a state of fury.
Mr. West and Mr. Mathews attempted to disconcert
him with interruptions, only, however, to find them-
selves put out of action by retorts which, even if
personal, were extremely effective. Mr. Bennett,
who defeated Mr. Wise in Gippsland, spoke to-day
from the Ministerial corner, and hit out at the
other side with considerable energy. There are still
two, three, or four more to hear from.
A censure motion —the usual pointless old
censure motion which never does a vestige
of good to anyone—is trailing gradually
along in the Australian Parliament. The
speechifying on the subject should last
another month at the present rate of progress.
Meanwhile the Cook Government has some
social legislation in view (the National In-
surance scheme, for example) which is so
important that Parliament should be given
a chance to at least say “Yes” or “No” upon
it. So the position is that there is a tre-
mendous lot of work to be done, and very
little time to do it in, while such time as
there is must, according to the traditions
of the Party Government game, be wasted in
embittered recriminations between those
who should be working. What on earth is
the sense in it all? Where is the value to
the country of Mr. Fleming’s talent for
lashing the Opposition to a state of fury?
What object do Messrs. West and Mathews
serve by attempting to disconcert Mr. Flem-
ing, and what is there admirable about
his “extremely effective even if personal re-
torts”? What is the use of Mr. Bennett’s
invective, or of the abusive language of the
“two, three or four more”* that are to be
heard from ? The answer of any reasonable
human being must be that there is no point
in any of these' things. They exist simply
because they have been among the appurte-
nances of Party Government for as long as
the mind of man can recall, and no one has
the courage or initiative to depart from the
evil old habit. So everyone is as childishly
offensive as possible to everyone else; and
W. H. Kelly hurries tirelessly around
nosing out'scandals; and maddened Labor-
ites threaten to flog him ; and large, meaty
Liberals offer to fight the potential (loggers;
and all the serious business of the nation
is held up in a way that would mean irre-
trievable ruin if it occurred in connection
with a private business firm. A ludicrous
feature of the case is the fact that all this
elaborate blackguardism, which is persisted
in for no other reason than that it is sup-
posed to allure the electors, scandalises and
disgusts them, in reality, more than any
other political institution. The modern
citizen’s contempt for Parliament is due
largely to the fatuous wrangling that pre-
vails there. He would not trust the direc-
tors of a company if they put in three parts
of their business hours cursing at each
other. For the same reason he profoundly
distrusts most of the people who direct the
fortunes of his native land. The first party
leader who has the sense and courage to do
away with the side of Party Government
which requires a steady flood of insults,

he exchanged between the Government and
the Opposition will win tremendous influ-
ence in the country. Picture the favorable
impression an Opposition would create in
t he Commonwealth, if it remained self-re-
pectingly silent under the clumsy badinage
of the braves of the other side. How Aus-
tralia would acclaim a Government which
refrained from retaliating when those who
were trying to jump its billet, accused it of
being collectively a swindling hog and a
robber of widows and orphans; and ad-
dressed itself resolutely and always, not to
“torrential fluency” and “ready rejoinder”
and the art of lashing the other crowd into
“a state of fury,” but to plain, drab work.
Almost anyone can lash another into a state
of fury. The ridiculously simple feat of
casting a quart of street mud into a man’s
face will make him as furious as any words
in the entire political lexicon. But work is
not so easy. That, probably, accounts for
the huge supply of slang-whangers that per-
colates into the House, by comparison with
the paltry number of toilers that arrives
there; and the combination of calamitous
circumstances certainly accounts to a great
extent for the country’s growing exaspera-
tion with Liberals and Laborites alike.
Labor in Maoriland.
Edward Trfgear, President of the Social
Democratic Party in Maoriland, writes
piece:—
In your issue, of July 81, page
a subleader entitled “Maoriland s Labor
—and among other assertions which app TT . tv
to be misleading, you state that the recent Unity
Congress “sagged at the knees, and sud y
irreparably split in half.” If the congres i PD i ian t

sag when the angry animal kneels cr P. hag been

all attempts to make labor unity po movement
prevent the initiation of an independe and Liberal
outside the control of the existing Tory ress
parties. For three valuable days the congress
endured the obstructionist tactics ; then
squelched the offenders. The v °t' n l? 1 9R etc ”
233 to 78 ; 296 to 50 ; 272 to 29 ; 265 to 26,
etc., show in what way congress ' wa ®, • jig,
lialf” by the malcontents. Since the g canitalistic
persed, the disgruntled ones (aided by the capitalistic
press) have done everything in their power to distort
the issues and deceive the public as to what took
place. Very bitter they are, but that is natural
enough ; to be forced to recognise the certainty that
you have missed the ’bus always provokes acrid and
flatulent criticism from the losers, especially in
labor circles.
The real position evolved from the congress is as
follows. About 200 unions, numbering some 20,000
men, are giving in their adherence (and their money
-—the real test) to the two new organisations, viz.,
the United Federation of Labor and the Social
Democratic Party, but before this time next year we
shall have 50,000 men with us. Our industrial body,
the Federation, is the only solvent, active and vital
combination of workers in Maoriland. It is not an
advocate of direct action, except as a last resort,
and it has guarded all extension of strikes in a
most careful and methodical way. It is idle for
people to call its members “revolutionaries,” “syndi-
calists,” or “red-raggers.” Abuse and derision glance
off us as hail slips off an ironclad. These men know
what they want, arid they—or their successors—will
get it.
Who are those forming our political body, the
Social Democrats? They are men and women who
find our so-called civilisation somewhat imperfect. Of
course, they recognise—as all must do—that at pre-
sent the highest social and economic rewards go to
the worthy and to the industrious; that the men
who h€w the marble and carry the bricks always in-
habit tlje palaces they build. They see how the
men who mine and’ forge and weld together the
sumptuous motor-Cars always ride in them, and that
the stokers who bask in the fiery luxury of the fur-
nace room to drive the great liner through the sea
are greater favorites of society than the poor idlers
who are condemned to endure the horrors of the first-
class saloon. They see Europe a mere modern
Alsatia, wherein the armed nations swagger up and
down like swashbucklers, and where the deified
army-contractor is accepted as the highest and latest
expression of cosmic thought. Still, these foolish
Social Democrats are not satisfied, and, having the
courage of their convictions, they are determined,
somehow, to get things altered. We are not “the
Crowd in a Hurry,” as you term us ; the 11,000,000
people in little Britain who do not know where the
next meal is to come from, they are the people
who should be —and will be —in a hurry. We have
plenty of time both to break things and make
things, and, at all events, are not in the class of
men (only too numerous) who chalk “Down with
exploiters!” on the wall, and then rush to kiss the
boots of the Fat Man as soon as he comes round the
corner.
I do not write this letter officially as president
of the Social Democrats in Maoriland —although
most of them would endorse it —I am writing as an
old correspondent of The Bulletin.
Well, here is the bald position as it appears
to The Bulletin (whose pious hope, by
the way, is that brotherly love and combina-
tion shall prevail amongst the workers of
M.L.). Early in the year the two distinct
Labor sections —one known as the Federa-
tion of Labor and the other as the United
Labor Party—agreed that it would be well
to join forces and push along under one
platform. So a conference was arranged
and the platform drawn up last month. In
the middle of the . operation some of the
leaders of the Trades and Labor Council’s
section withdrew in alarm at a glimpse of
the corral, as they considered it, into which
the more powerful representatives of the
Federation of Labor were leading them.
Subsequently, an official statement was is-
sued on behalf of the United Labor party
“to the unions, branches of the party and
all progressive people,” from which a few
clips will help to illustrate the spirit of
unity that now barks like a dog with a vac-
cinated tail: —
The United Congress has met and concluded its
sittings. Its most striking feature was the marked
absence of any true spirit of unity.... At the conclu-
sion of the congress the delegates of the United
Labor party’s organisations assembled and fully dis-
cussed the grave position resulting from the decisions
of the congress. Over 60 delegates were present, and
of these 55 agreed that the United Labor Party
should maintain its identity.
This seems fairly definite. In fact, it could
hardly be more definite without working
overtime. But, just by way of good will, a
statement made by Robert Semple, organ-
iser for the United Federation of Labor,
at Christchurch, not many days back, may
be thrown in. “The Congress constitution,
he said,, “was an effort to organise the work-
ing class on the job. If they were linked up
solidly, they would fix themselves up solidly
in politics.” Just how much fixing is to be
done is suggested by the estimable Edward
Tregear himself. “About 20,0U0 men, he
estimates, “are giving in their adherence to
the Federation, and before this time next
year 50,000 men will be with us.” If he had
said he hoped to see a party 50,000 strong
The Bulletin would have, accompanied
him the whole distance. As it is, it knocks
off at the half-way house to relieve the
strain on its optimism.
Broken Hill and Busted Law.
When, the other day, the Law issued
an order forbidding a certain strike in
Broken Hill, and when the strikers went
on striking in cheerful defiance of the
Law, Broken Hill merely did what it
has got into the habit of doing;
and when James McGowen, the man who
misses the ’bus, declined to take any action
to vindicate his own party’s law, James
McGowen did exactly what he has got into
the habit of doing too. Generally speak-
ing, nobody ever expects the misguided
Broken Hill unions to do any except the
mistaken things they want to do. lhey are
their own statutes. Their disregard tor
the laws made by the Federal Labor party
is as complete as for those made by tLe
State Labor party. After compulsory De-
fence service had been instituted by the
Commonwealth, prominent members of their
unions openly defied that law, and the chief
officers crowned and otherwise rewarded
the rebels. When the State made strikes
illegal, Broken Hill showed what it thought
of the party of which it is supposed to be
an enthusiastic supporter, by promptly
striking and holding up the one great indus-
try of the Place. And it not only did
that but it intimated to the Government
that if the latter was not prepared to seize
the property of the Silverton Tramway Co.,
it would organise a raid on its own account.
As a matter of fact, it did not organise a
faid but it flouted the law—administered
at the time bv a Labor Government—and
decided from the Trades Hall what traffic
should be permitted in the streets of the
town and it listed those who might be
served with goods and those who. were to
be literally starved into submission. Tor
that nobody was so much as spoken to un-
Sndlv bv the McGowen Government. The
f f Lt two of McGowen’s Ministers hap-
faCt t renresent the flagrant law-breakers
probably had something to
do with it Stimulated by the spinelessness
the Government, the sanitary men stepped
“fffteir «« and not only canoed hor-
ribie discomfort, but imperilled the health
of the town, it mattered nothing that the
Municipal Gouucii, in whose employ they
were, was a Laour council, with a Labor
mayor, and that the State, under wiiose
laws they were supposed to live, was in the
hands of a Labor Government. vVitli a
snameless disregard alike for the public con-
venience and foy the good name of the party
to which they were supposed to belong—a
party which was put into power largely on
the plea that its administration would pre-
vent industrial disturbances —these men went
on strike and continued on strike for some
time. And again the law decided that it
didn’t rim as tar as Broken Hill, and said
never a word. Naturally this utter disre-
gard for the Law, no matter of whose mak-
ing it may be, has produced the most demor-
alising effects. Things that decent unions
and self-respecting unionists would scorn to
do elsewhere, those of Broken Hill do with-
out compunction. The biggest of the
organisations, numbering about GOOD mem-
bers, makes a Is. leA'y on every member in
case of fatal accident. This is for the
widow. But the widow gets little of
it. The levy brings in about i. 300; the
widows’ mite is £lOO. The other £2OO is
to play with. At different times various
businesses have been bought. With money
raised in this or similar fashion the trade
outfit of a prominent man in ’‘the move-
ment” was purchased at a high price. It
was run for a while —and then it was
dropped. The “movement” put the shut-
ters up, and the man who had done good ser-
vice to “the Cause” had “the Cause’s”
money. What could be fairer? Of course
all the money filched from the widows is
“invested.” In one business —admirable in
itself —something like £7OOO has been “in-
vested” in driblets. So far as can be ascer-
tained, not one penny of interest has ever
been paid, nor is it ever likely to be. There
is no discussion of these matters on the
spot. The few bosses who govern the
entire “movement,” and decide which laws
shall be recognised and which ignored,
which families shall be permitted to have
food, and which shall be proscribed —these
few men show no mercy to any who bring
their lawlessness into the daylight. _ There
are only two classes at Broken Hill —the
mine-workers and those who are in busi-
ness to serve them. The latter have been
reduced almost to a position of helotry. This
last strike is a case in point. The unions
have their co-operative stores. When it was
judged necessary to give the shopkeepers a
taste of the whip, certain demands were
made in connection with assistants’ pay.
The unions’ stores of course accepted the
terms; if they lose money, there is always
the widows’ fund to rifle. “Arbitrate !” said
the Law. “Work on till reason settles
this.” But that was no good to the bosses
of the “movement.” They wanted to drive
trade to their own stores—and that is the
simple reason why the strike was persisted
in in defiance of the Law. Moving on such
a low moral plane, the “movement” attracts
men of poor character and degrades others
who are decent enough when they enter it.
Only a fortnight ago the officer who had
chiefly organised the disreputable tramway
strike, having been either too clumsy or too
greedy, was sentenced to two years for em-
bezzling the funds. The whole business has
been for years past indeed a procession of
shortages and sudden disappearances. But
these are merely the straws upon the muddy
stream. Broken Hill, once a bright light,
in the Labor movement, has either drifted
or been dragged until to-day it is an incubus
and a reproach, an inconvenience to the
party to which it professes allegiance, and
a training-ground for nearly all that makes
for bad citizenship.
♦ —-
The Holman Government and Its New
Middleman.
A great number of peonle fancied, a year
or half a year ago, that the llolman-
McGowen-Grieeith-Cann Ministry of
N.S.W. could hardly get down to lower
depths of muddle than it had done, but
these sanguine folk find themselves mistaken.
There was a depth that they hadn t aus-
pected. The present crowd came into office
under a solemn promise to economise, and
reduce borrowing, and keep the finances
straight. It didn’t economise, but, rather,
though it had the biggest revenue in all
the State’s history, it built up the biggest
deficit in the State’s history. It didnt
reduce borrowing: instead, it rushed the
loan disease on a scale never before heard
of Next, it promised that no loan money
should be spent, except on works that
would pay full interest and sinking
fund, and instead of adhering to this rule,
it blewed the money so recklessly
that it had to raise railway fares, in
order to prevent the former big railway
profit becoming an actual loss. When it
persuaded Henry vvillis to take the
Speakership, and thus save it from destruc-
tion—because it must have a Speaker, and
it couldn’t spare one of its own men—it
solemnly promised that no contentious legis-
lation would be attempted, and that there
would be an early dissolution. It re-
caDtured a disputed seat, and recovered its
lost majority, and repudiated the contract
on the ground that it didn’t need to keep
its word when it was strong enough to
break it. It was great on having its finance
beyond suspicion, yet it gave an insurrec-
tionary member of the party, who looked like
making trouble, £4 a day to go to the United
States and report on dry bee-farming, or-the
reason why pigs have wings, or the cause
of the boiling of or the preval-
ence of the rum-shrub in public-houses, or
something else of a rather intangible ehar-
acter out with *TI these fallings away
the Holm a n-McGowen Government seemed,
until lately, to be solid on two of its
alleged principles —its faith in Public Enter-
prise and its hostility to the superfluous
middleman. Now a member of the wonder-
ful Ministrv has laid before the State Legis-
lature a scheme by which an English firm
iJ'toito chare, of the job of float,n s
£3.000.000 worth nf N.S.W. non
amount originally suggested was £10.000,000,
but the other £7.000,000 may transpire
later), and supervise the construction of
the railways that are to be built with this
monev For this it is to get a commission
of 5 per cent. (£lso.ooo)—that is to say,
the Government will apparently pay the
ordinary expenses in the ordinary old way,
and there will be a new middleman and
Private Enterprise agent to be paid in addi-
tion. Tne reason advanced for employing
these new middlemen (Norton, Griffiths
and Co.), to help with the loan-floating job,
is that their credit, or support, or counte-
nance, or cheek, or something of the sort,
will make it easier to raise the money. It
is rather a shock to learn that the reputa-
tion of the proud old Ma State has got
so low that it needs to hire a new Private
Enterprise firm of financiers to speak kindly
to the public about its lOU, in order to
make the document a little more acceptable.
And if the proposal to hire an English firm,
at a huge commission, to supervise the con-
struction of railways in N.S.W., doesn’t
mean that the feeble, futile Government
finds its own methods of supervision a fail-
ure —well, if it doesn’t mean that, what does
it mean? There are competent engineers
and competent foremen in Australia an
aboundauce of them. They can do their
work as well as any other men of their class
on earth —unless some interfering person-in-
ofhce, in his anxious pursuit of votes, pre-
vents them maintaining discipline and
exacting a fair day’s work for a reason-
able day’s pay. If the absurd Government
leases out the job of supervision to a Private
Enterprise scapegoat from England, it may,
of course, be able to say that any unpleas-
antness is due, not to it, but to its agents,
and possibly that is what is aimed at. Un-
less the Ma State’s credit has really become
so bad that it requires the special recommen-
dation of an English bloated capitalist to
help the sale of its promissory note —the
firm doesn’t guarantee the promissory note,
so its moral influence is all that it throws
into the scale —there are only two possible
advantages to be got out of the proposed
costly arrangement. One is the aid of a
capable English firm to do the skilled work
which the incapable Australian can’t do.
and the Holman Government hasn’t yet
ventured to say that the Australian is in-
capable. The other is the aid of an Eng-
lish nigger-driver to do the nigger-driving
that the Holman Government dare not do
itself, for fear of losing votes.
About Wages anil Prices.
N.S.W. Premier Holman has been on his
feet with a whirling statement to the effect
that increased wages don’t cause an in-
crease of prices. That absurd lemaik
shows the difficulty of being a Foreign-
trader and a Laborite at the same time
The Foreign-trader believes in cheap living
regardless of the fact that cheap-living coun-
tries —China is a notable sample—are, in
the main, poor, beggarly, backward coun-
tries The Laborite believes in high wages.
It is possible to have greatly increased
wages along with greatly cheaper production
if the increase is accompanied by a vast
improvement in machinery. Eli Whitney s
cotton gin, which enabled one nigger to do
the amount of work, in a particular branch
of the cotton industry, which had formerly
required anything from 1500 to 3000 niggers,
is a case in point. But if there is no special
improvement in machinery then increased
pay must mean increased price—unless, of'
course, it means decreased profits. The
wages of members of Parliament lately went
up, and there being no counter-balancing
improvement in mechanism the cost of legis-
lation went up. Anybody who looks at the
bill for the maintenance of Parliament can
see that. The wages of N.S.W. railway
men recently went up, but there were no
improved methods. It was the same old
4ft. B|in. track; the same old steam locomo-
tive carrying its coal behind it and its own
little separate fire in its own little separate
tummy; the same old congestion ; the same
old Johnson. So the cost of railway trav-
elling went up for everybody except the
holders of workmen’s tickets, they being
supposed to vote for Holman ; and despite
the rise in the price of locomotion the rail-
ways ceased to be the great help to the
revenue which they had been. As for the
tramways, they changed from a big profit to
a big loss. The other day a Sydney pottery
concern was struck with an award which
added £l5OO a year to the wages-sheet in a
certain branch •of its business. It wasn t
making £l5OO a year out of that particular
branch, and it couldn’t put up prices be-
cause, under the wretchedly low tariff, it
already competed with difficulty against
foreign firms, which only paid about half
the wages it did before the new award came,
and which hadn’t been struck by any new
award. As there was no improvement in
the tariff, and no new invention for the re-
duction of costs came along at the right
moment, and as £l5OO a year can’t come
out of nothing, no matter what Holman,
the Foreign-trader, may say, this particular
branch of the works closed up. The curse
of the Labor party is its Foreign-trade sec-
tion, which demands that the Australian
worker shall get twice the pay of the Eng-
lishman and yet compete on practically even
terms with the Englishman of else become 1
an unemployed and a pauper.

from market and other reports in Sydney dailies of
August 22.
A fowl is a tame and affectionate bird, with
an appetite steady and keen ;
The things it will swallow are quite absurd
—they range from a bone to a bean ;
Grit, centipedes, cabbage and ancient meat;
skins, pips, grain, bull-ants and hay,
Worms, tea-leaves and coke —all vanish like
smoke, if a chicken should come their
way!
From dawn till dusk a chicken will peck,
and forage, and pry and scratch —
An average hen will beat most men when it
comes to a digging-match !
For the “Government stroke” is a thing un-
known to a Leghorn with fourteen
chicks —
Ere she goes to bed she will shift the dead,
dull weight of a thousand bricks!
She clucks for food for her yellow brood —
and gets it, too, you bet!
She leads them straight where the young
crops wait, and —the chickens are
hungry yet!
Seed, insect, grub, blade, and leaf and bud
are ruthlessly reduced,
And the weii-Kept garucu’s name is Mud
when the chicks go home to roost!
A Government’s often an honest thing
before it’s a Government —
Like a little boy dressed for Sunday-school
it wouldn’t annex a cent!
It wouldn’t be rude, or yell, or gorge, or
dirty its Sunday suit — .
But wait till the Sunday-school is done, and
the boy is among the fruit!
When Jimmy and Bill and Arthur and
Alf were dressed in their Sunday best,
They stood before Ma—yes, Ma herself!
and promised with joyous zest
That they'd not imitate bold, bad boys, like
Charlie and Tom and George,
And raid the orchard with hideous noise,
and squabble and fight and gorge
No! They were nice little, good little,
chaps who’d always keep neat and
clg3.ii
They weren’t like a hen with fourteen
chicks and an appetite strong and keen .
They didn’t like bones, and. as for loans
Oh, never! Ma might be sure
That they wouldn’t borrow and cause her
sorrow, by camping at Cohen’s door.
A Loan is a tame and affectionate thing at
times it- is awkwardly so!
It stands with its head half under its wing,
with its meek, soft eyes aglow ;
And, trustfully, like a hen forlorn, it fol-
lows you home to bed —
But wait till its fourteen chicks are born,
and the clutch has got to be fed.
Then Jimmy and Bill and Arthur and
Alf roll up near the old Barn Door.
And each has a hen, and each hen has
chicks —you can count ’em by the score.
They’ve got to be fed— and the food s all
gone, and the Garden is wholly goosed.
And Ma’s horror-struck, and it s dashed bad
luck that the Chicks have come home
to roost!

Ex-Minister Frazer and “The Bulletin.”
This paper announces with regret that it
has made no progress at digging a definite
reply out of the very remarkable ex-Post-
master-General Frazer. That individual,
to whom reference was made in “Plain
English” (Bulletin 14/8/’l3), claims that
he wasn’t quite accurately reported, but his
own recollection of what happened doesn’t
seem to make any visible difference. This
is his view of the case:—
Messrs. Levetus and Miller moved and seconded
a, vote of thanks. They complimented me on my
address, and expressed the hope that I would soon
again, be Postmaster-General. In reply, I said
amongst other things: “It had been suggested in The
•Bulletin that in the event of the Fisher Govern-
ment being returned to power, I would probably be
retired. I do not hold that view. An administrator
bad some difficult work to perform. For instance, I
had control of Wireless Telegraphy. Some time back
an offer had been made by the Australasian Wireless
Company to sell their rights to the Commonwealth
tor L 45,00°. A member of that company was Mr.
mLLiAM McLeod. (Some reference was made here
to George.” Mr. Geo. McLeod happened to be
my chairman s name.) The offer was turned down
by the Fisher Government. Widespread interest
attended this action. Mr. William McLeod was
also Managing Director of The Bulletin, and it was
therefore not altogether surprising that, since the
action referred to, some Bulletin writers could see
little good in Frazer’s administration.”
Now the Managing Director of The
Bulletin and others had Frazer’s assur-
ance that he (Frazer) favored the accept-
ance of the offer of the Australasian Wire-
less Co. and that he (Frazer) was over-
ruled by his colleagues. Therefore if the
policy of the paper was directed in the in-
terests of the Managing Director’s private
investments Frazer would have been the
man in the Fisher Cabinet that it
bave been expected to support.
When Codlin and not Short is the friend
any paper which was run to serve the in-
terests of one shareholder would naturally
support Codlin. Frazer’s plea is that
Codlin was the member of the Ministry
whom it specially failed to support. The ex-
Postmaster-General was invited to show,
by extracts from The Bulletin, that it
changed from being a supporter to an oppo-
nent when the Australasian Wireless Co’s
offer was rejected, and in that matter it
nas failed to garner any information what-
soever. There is the deadest possible
silence. So The Bulletin repeats its
remark that the cheapest thing a cheap
politician can do is to assume that he is
suc “ «■ marvel that no criticism of his
met “°ds can be honest criticism, and that
anybody who regards even his telephone
service as imperfect must be filled with the
basest motives.
From a Vic. correspondent:—
w< ;ak spot in the Vic. Wages Board system—
namely its Court of Industrial Appeal—is stressed
by a strike that is now proceeding on Yarra-side.
Neither the Court, nor any AVages Board, has power
l t V™ f , orc . e ll lt £ decisions in case of a strike or a
lockout. All Board determinations have, up to now,
been loyally observed by the workers, though all the
decisions of the Appeal Court have been very much
FnHHpr t. T n Wh ? n ’ T. * he case of the Fuel and
Fodder Trades Board—which largely concerns the coal-
lumpers, baggers and carters along the river wharves
Q *; us !' l^ e A Beckett said that ‘‘in his position a wide
acquaintance with industrial conditions was neces-
h°wever > he did not, and could not,
possess, the climax was reached. It was felt that
the last straw had been imposed on the camel’s pro-
testing hump And trouble arrived. It is certainlv
unfortunate that his Honor, out of his admitted
ignorance, should have had to review the determina-
tions of seven practical men—all the delegates and
tne Board s chairman were men of industrial exneri-
ence and should have upset those specially which
Hoard a h r Tfi at l * V nanirnous v °te. A previous
Board had fixed the minimum wage at Bs. 4d per
day; the existing one. the subject of the appeal! had
said 95., and had fixed carters’ hours at 52 per week
Justice a’Beckett, though confessedly knowing less
than these experts, lowered the wages to Bs. per dav
and raised the carters’ hours to 58 per week The
employees thereupon asked for a conference’- the
employers decided to stand on the Appeal Court’s
decision and refused. And so—a strike. Had Jus-
tl°e l . i A ? ECK^ T , T been Rli &htlv less frank, the men
might have felt rather less aggrieved. A Judge who
gives reasons always was a curse.
The N.S.W. Labor Government seems to
have an absolute yearning after the foreign
or absentee capitalist. When it first de-
vised its Income-Tax Bill it deliberately
made the tax upon the rich, absentee land-
lord. who spends has rents in Eng-
land, much lower than that on any little
manufacturing co. which works in Austra-
lia. employs Australian labor at Australian
wages, and divides a very hungry little divi-
dend among Australian shareholders. The
Government had to go back on that blazing
iniquity, but it never explained whv it tried
to subsidise the absentee landlord to the
detriment of the Australian manufacturer
Wow it has devised a scheme wherebv an
English firm is to supervise N.S.W. railway
bunding, at 5 per cent, on the money ex-
pended. so that the more money is expended
or wasted the more profit the English firm
will get. When did any Australian con-
tractors get a gorgeous offer like that? Never
between sunrise and the Day of Judgment!
When is it likelv to? Not anywhere between
Noaii s Ark and the Southern Cross !

The long-looked-for production of Edward
Dyson s play, “The Golden Shanty,” will
take place at the Palace (Sydney) on Satur-
day night. Bert Bailey and his partners
(Edmund Duggan and Julius Grant) have
spared no trouble t.o foster success, and it
can be taken as a sine qua non, not to say
a dead cert., that the indefatigable and
clever author has done more than his allow-
ance to please the continent-wide public
which has, for so many years, enjoyed his
stories and verses in The Bulletin and
various other publications, to say nothing
of a small stack of books from his pen.
Until Saturday, “The Native Born” will
continue as the attraction at the Palace.
Adeline Gende continues to hold the stage
at Her Majesty’s, Sydney. Amongst those
who knew something of dancing, or who
had seen the star in the past, disappoint-
ment was expressed after her first appear-
ance and for some nights following. She
seemed strangely heavy and lacking in fire
It is now explained on her behalf that at
the time when the most fulsome apprecia-
tions of her art were appearing in the local
papers she was miles below her proper form,
cis the result of an ailing leg. To use her
own words to a Sun writer, she was “a
little heroine” to have danced at all in the
circumstances. A bad leg in a dancer may
be fairly compared to laryngitis in a singer,
vv hat would be thought of a critic
who frantically poured forth all the adjec-
tives in his lexicon of adulation in the case
a Marguerite with a had sore throat?
ia tais paper’s opinion such a person would
stand forth as about one part critic to five,
parts press agent; and that is how it re-
gards a number of the ludicrous Genee
blitherers of the past week. But even at
her best, there is too much Genee at Her
Majesty s—too much, that is to say, for her
a°c,u 6 S^OW t° the best advantage.
After all one can have too much cake. Some
people can even be given a surplusage of
ale.

a i r , he u- e we £ e competing shows at the
Adelphi on Saturday night—the unsuccess-
ful attempt of a young man to shoot a
constable outside the theatre, and the re-
of “The Luck of Roaring Camp” in-
side. This referee gives the decision to the
unrehearsed performance outside; firstly
because you can’t see that sort of show
every day. and you can see the “Luck of
Roaring Camp” style of bellowdrama at
just about everv other Adelphi show you
drop in on ; and, secondly, the open-air show
was tree and you got your money’s worth
and the Marlowdrama wasn’t free and onlv
a few got full weight. Still, as it is most
unlikely that the first turn will be repeated,
the Adelphi won’t be a permanent sufferer
from outside and unlicensed performers
‘Roaring Camp” exploded or dripped

It’s a sure sign of the adjacency of sum-
mer when Manager Edwin Gea'ch starts
packing West’s spare cinematograph at the
Olympia (Sydney) for the Glaciarium
season, which commences when the skating-
ice in that big amusement establishment
melts. This week, at the Olympia, paying
guests have been given a cinothrill. entitled
“Death to the Traitor,” which illustrates
the lengths the blastiferous foreign spy is
prepared to go in the game of war and
plunder—man’s eternal winning double.

Since this publication last had occasion
to draw attention to the proceedings at the
National (Sydney) there have arisen new
complications. In fact, the position is en-
tirely changed. Practically the whole of
last week’s vaudevillains have disappeared.
In their old familiar places are a string of
Australian. English and American per-
formers with reputations to maintain and
a sufficiency of entertaining goods for the
work. Anybody is at liberty to contradict
this, but it would be wise to see the show
first. After that he is at liberty to perjure
himself into the Lake of Burning Brim-
stone ; yea, even unto the place where all
the fowls gather to the great supper of
captains and mighty men and tremendous
liars.

After Friday night there will be no more
“Butterfly on the Wheel” at Sydney Royal.
On Saturday evening the Waller-Titheradge
co. is to commence a week of “A Marriage
of Convenience.” The delicate costume play
is chalked up as one of Waller’s big suc-
cesses, and it contains a part in which
clever Madge Titheradge should captivate
the town. Under the promising circum-
stances, a mere week seems too short.

The Khinegold,” the prologue to the
trilogy, kept the audience busy listening
thinking, ,and occasionally yawning, in *
dim, religious light, for 2i hours wi hout a
pause. When it is said that 150 cons!
tive minutes of “Rheingold” seemed "
shorter time than 2$ hours of ordinary non
ular concert, the genius of Wagner i s
frankly admitted. The story of this opera
has no more spiritual grace than the panto
varn of Sinbad and the Old Man of the Sea
Wotan an absurd old German god who is
afflicted with a scolding wife and a patch of
hair over one eye, commandeers a bag of
Rhine-tin from an angry gnome who had
previously shaken it from the Rhine mer
maids. Heaven knows what all these sillv
prehistoric people want with the jingling
metal. _ Wotan no sooner gets the treasure
than his wife, Fncka, makes him give it
away to a couple of giants in ransom for
his daughter. Meanwhile the gnome who
nicked it from the bottom of the river
has put a curse on the portable propertv-
a _ hearty Saturday-night curse—and this
sticks to Wotan and his family through the
following three volumes of the “Ring.” A
god incapable of sterilising a gnome’s curse,
or stopping his wife’s tongue, is not touch
of a person to write a four-volume opera
about ’ hut he was the best excuse Wagner
could find for his long-winded discourse.

Robert Parker as Wotan, Edna Thornton
as his masterful missus, Spencer Thomas
as Loge the Fire God (Loge seems to be
the original of our friend Fire in “The Blue
Gird”), \V. J. Samuel, Gladys Ancrum and
others stood around and posed and sang for
those 2$ hours. The fact that the doors of
the auditorium were closed all the while,
to prevent any condemned souls from flit-
ting away, helped to complete the drowsi-
ness of the effect. The atmosphere hummed
a lullaby, so to streak. Wagner is a slow,
majestic musical orator. In spite of his
verbosity he demands a patient hearing,
lie must be taken seriously. All the same,
lie ought to be taken lying down —on 11
couch. “The Valkyrie, - ’ the livest and best-
known of the Ring operas, took its turn on
hriday, and proved to be an advance on
last year’s revival, especially on the first
act. Spencer Thomas and Gladys Ancrum,
both of them stronger than they were,
vocally and dramatically, gave a forceful
performance of the tenor and soprano parts.
True, the lady was more giddy and tart-
like in method than the serene Sara Ander-
son of Musgrove’s turbulent German co..
but she acted with tender grace and feel-
ing. Parker, as the same old Wotan with
the shrouded optic, and Edna Thornton, as

Brumihilde. Her figure lacked majesty and
lier voice broke no records. She was merely
nn adequate item in the general success.
“Tales of Hoffmann” (Wednesday
matinee) fell short of expectations. Spencer
Thomas was a passable hero. Little Felice
Lyne (the Gilda of “Rigoletto”) revealed
no bird-like fluency of song as the Doll, and
was striking only in the simple childishness
of her appearance, which, by the way, made
Hoffmann’s infatuation seem ridiculous.
Graham Marr was a feeble magician in all
respects, and the new Antonia (Alice
Browse) did nothing to lift the tail end of
the show. That the violins sang sweetly
in the Barcarolle goes without saying.
Quinlan’s violins are charming. In'“La
Tosca” and “Samson and Delilah” the prin-
cipals bumped violently against public re-
collections of the Melba season. “Tosca”
was very interesting, in so far that the
orchestra gave a brighter interpretation of
Puccini’s music than the Melba orchestra
did, and the melodramatic story carried
Brola, Maurice D’Oisly and Samuell
(Scarpia) along with it. Their voices
lacked ginger, however. Sometimes the
singing of those respectable artists, com-
pared with Wayda, McCormack and Scan-
diani, was as a whisper of the past. “Sam-
son,” the least likeable production of the
week, introduced Franz Costa as the cham-
pion of the Israelites. Costa had a suffi-
ciency of brawn and stature, but his warble
was only passable, and he made a poor
struggle against the blandishments of Edna
Thornton, who neither sang nor blandished
in an exciting way. “Faust,” last Satur-
day, came out strongest in the second scene
of the third act, where the soldiers chor-
used, and the maids of Nuremberg made
a fuss over them, and Valentine (Samuell)
died most impressively, although he had
previously stood up to curse his sister ; and
Mabel Dennis won an imperative encore
for Siebel’s song. Miss Dennis is not the
contralto Siebel of “Faust” traditions. She
scored with her sweetly incisive mezzo so-
prano and her admirable enunciation of
the words. Moreover, the setting of this
scene is particularly good. For the rest,
Jeanne Brola was a pleasing Marguerite,
and D’Oisly a stout, placid Faust; whilst
William Anderson’s restrained Mephisto
uttered his good, bass voice in a language
which might often have been Dutch for all
that the audience could make of it.

To-night (Thursday) the Quinlan star
production, “Louise,” will eventuate for the
first Australian time. To-morrow is dedi-
cated to “The Twilight of the Gods,” the
fourth volume of the “Ring” romance, and
on Saturdav “The Barber of Seville” will
come new to the present generation. The
Wednesday matinee performance next week
is to be a symphony concert.

The latest “turns” at Melbourne Opera
House are attractive and otherwise. Eight
Saxones, who were delayed in their arrival,
proved to be merely a double quartette of
young step-dancers who make a point of
changing their garments in view of the
audience; but six Hoboes are a pleasing
assortment of tramp comedians who work
on the lines of the Grafters and mix their
humor rather cleverly. _ Billie Reeves’s
scene of inarticulate insobriety continues to
be just a trifle too prolonged. The Mullers
manipulate their hoops with unerring skill.
Bellora repeats his series of _ noises taken
from animal life, and Beatrice, the lady
colleague of Diamond, is again making her
clarionet sing like an angel. The only re-
grettable incident in the rest of the bill is
the reappearance of the roosters—creatures
that should be served up dead, with parsley
sauce.

At Melbourne Bijou it happens that “The

ther appeal with “Fanny’s First I my.
lately introduced to Watt’s city at the

Bernard Shaw as a literary playwright
should turn the thoughts of Culcliaw in the
direction of this brilliant little comedy.

Wirths’ Circus is back at the old Mel-
bourne stand with most of the familiar
marvels and some that are new. Hillary
Long is still the phenomenon of the show,
and continues to earn his bread by walking
upside-down. Strictly speaking, he is
rarely off his head during his turn, and
never suggests that he would feel more
comfortable if he lived an upright life. La
Belle Victoria is a new queen of the sway-
ing wire, and this writer bows down and
worships before her throne. Alfredo and
his minions are commended for their aerial
adroitness, Alfredo’s own trapeze solo being
largely responsible for the commendation.
A tribe of tumblers, wire-walkers, and other
acrobats, including the Bastons, the Nel-
sons, and the Hobson Sisters, earn their
living on a stage with scene-fixings and a
new drop curtain, while the numerous riding
acts and the melancholy clown happen
in the arena as heretofore. Also, the bears
and Burrows’s elephants are sagacious con-
tributors to the bill of fare, and Lizzie, the
hippo, continues to be as unlike Gen6e as
ever. There is no thistledown suggestion
about Elizabeth.

In “The Fortune Hunter” at Melbourne
Royal the tenets of Nibloism continue to be

evening at 9 o’clock or thereabouts Niblo be-
gins to pervade the streets of Radville Park
and rescue Sam Graham from the financial
rocks. By about 10 he has restored Samuel
to his old place in public confidence and
given him a large bank account to play with.
Half-an-hour later he has himself become
horribly affluent and can pick the biggest
plum on the matrimonial tree. It is sus-
pected in some quarters that he is teaching
his methods by correspondence, and that
Willy Holman, Johnny Cann and Aa-ty
Griffith are his first pupils.

Art note from Melbourne (there is almost
too much art in this world) :
Still another art show at the Athenaeum. This
time Montague Brown and Leslie Wilkie are the
culprits, though there seems no visible reason for
the pair running in harness. Wilkie is easily the
better craftsman of the two, and his merit in his
portrait work only serves to make Monty’s contribu-
tion look dull and monotonous, Wilkie’s portrait of
Adamson, the popular head Of the Wesley College,
is one of his most effective achievements to date,
and he demonstrates in “Vanity” and other things
that his youthful promise is capable of getting a
further move on it. Brown is fust a conscientious,
indefatigable producer of passable landscapes. Even
in his large canvases, “Arbores Juvenes Patriae”
and “Nature’s Tranquil Mood,” the ordinariness of
his handling is rather conspicuous.
THE QUINLAN OPERA CO., AT HER
MAJESTYS, MELBOURNE (“La Tosca").
“Wamba, a Child of the Jungle” con-
tributed to the entertainment of The Bul-
letin at West’s Melbourne house on Satur-
day. It was a pathetic tale of child abduc-
tion, with the abductor served up as a lion s
breakfast in the exciting conclusion. “Noisy
Suitors” was a greaser romance in a comic
vein, while “Playing with Fire” was a bit
of domestic fiction demonstrating that the
course of true love is often interrupted by
the lady’s husband. The tenth instalment
of “What Happened to Mary” was also un-
folded and revealed the battered heroine
still enduring the biffs of Fate and coming
up gamely for another round with out-
rageous fortune.
A critic on the Sketch (London) has the pluck
to tell the truth about a “disrobing act.” It is the
one which the French lady, Janette Denarber, was
thrown out of the Empire for giving—and a law
court decided that the throw-out was justified. She
just moved on to the Pavilion, which boomed the
turn as her “notorious act.” Probably it was modi-
fied a bit; anyway, the Sketch man says: Never
have I seen any show of the kind that was so un-
compromisingly innocuous. .. .1 must confess to hav-
ing come away with feelings of the most dismal dis-
appointment. I cannot help thinking that when one
goes to a music-hall expecting to be shocked, one
has some sort of right to be shocked lust a little
bit.” But why expect anything more? _ All stage
disrobing acts leave off just as they get interesting;
otherwise the stage-manager has to use the boot, as
the one at the Empire did.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Harrison O.”: To me the most distressing feature
of that bright comedy, “The Man on the Box, as
its American heroine. This person, be it said, is
charmingly acted by Miss Violet Paget; but the
average male sinner, who loves woman too niucn to
bore her by offering her homage, is dead-tired ot
the haughty type of divinity drawn by Dana Gibson
and written of by George Birr McCutcheon. Betty
Annesley, of “The Man on the Box,” is said by one
of the characters to be “as cold as an iceberg, and
is represented as the sort of female who would
accept a box at the opera as one of woman s rights,
and then sit through the performance weiring the
expression of a person who (as Norman Lindsay once
put it) “has found a bad oyster in her soup, is
too well-bred to make a fuss about it. | With
these Yankee goddesses, sulks, rudeness, pettiness and
pig-headed obstinacy are supposed to indicate ex-
treme delicacy of mind and a high nobility of char-
acter, and to inspire a dog-like devotion in all males
who come in contact with them. Why is it that
Yankee novelists and dramatists insist on depicting
the love of a man for a woman as a quality that
flourishes under contempt and thrives upon insults i
It’s up to Uncle Sam to fire in a writ for a million
dollars and clear his character from the implied
aspersion.
There is a refreshing frankness about manager
Quinlan’s reference to the old established German
opera stars —the resident idols of the public who
sing at Bayreuth, and such places. Quinlan describes
them as “animated beer barrels,” much too lazy
and self-satisfied to practise any of the self-
denial which is second nature with a jockey or a
gymnast. Apparently the Germans strike Quinlan
as being worse than the Italians in their arrogant
contempt for figure culture. But the Dagoes leave
a lot to be desired. The average tenor from Sunny
Italy has no sooner qualified his voice to sing roman-
tic hero parts than he proceeds to eat and drink
himself into caricatures of his favorite characters.
He is so immensely proud of his vocal effects and
the feminine adoration they win for him that his
eyes are blinded to his greasy podginess, and he
never even dreams of feeling horribly ashamed of
his tummy. The beauty actor is capable of strict
attention to business. He takes care of his appear-
ance, because he knows that his appearance takes
care of him. It is his principal means of support.
But the fat tenor, reckoning that his only business
is to sing, is content to 101 l around and feed his
mellifluous tones with fried macaroni when he ought
to be swinging a pair of clubs.
From London: Canon Hannay, the author of that
rollicking Irish farce, “General John Regan,” has
resigned his billet of Protestant rector of Westport,
where Archbishop Carr, of Melbourne, was, once a
curate. He has resigned for two reasons. One is
that he is drawing £lOO a week in royalties from
the “General,” and is likely to go on doing it for
a long time to come. Being thus made financially
independent, he is going to devote all his time to
literary work. The other reason is that Westport
has grown hot and sultry. Its inhabitants strongly
object to their town being guyed as Hallymoy in
the “General,” and some of themselves held up to
the loud laughs of Cockney audiences. So whenever
the canon puts his nose outside his house, he hears
a little good Irish about himself —some plain, some
with frills to it.
(Continued on page 26.)
A certain shred of fuss is being made
about the arrival in Australia of the “De-
signer of the Federal Capital.” He is a
foreigner of course —from the U.S. He
designed the capital by contract —not by
ds "-labor- and his _ design was imported,
which might be all right from Bruce Smith s
point of view, but wasn’t very glorious from
Fisher’s point of view.
A. E. Clarke, one of the founders of the
Melbourne Stock Exchange, died in Mel-
bourne last week, aged 76. He was son of
William Clarke, one of the first to establish
a gold-buying office in Melbourne. At first
Clarke, senior, was in Collins-street, but
afterwards he hung aut his shingle on the
south-east corner of Elizabeth-street and
Little Collins-street, where his piles of gold
and gold specimens, in stronglv-barred show-
cases, were an attraction in the late ’so’s.
.Later on he became a stock and share
broker; that was in the days when the
“Exchange” was on the pavement in front
of the Hall of Commerce, Collins-street.
From the outset William Clarke and Sons
were noted for their straight dealings. The
survivor, A. E., retired from the business
some years ago, and Rutter Clarke,_ a son.
succeeded him, and later on called in Fred
H. Bathurst, for many years financial edi-
tor of the Argus, to be his invaluable lieu-
tenant.
Sydney’s newest crime sensation is the
finding, in the thick scrub at La Perouse,
the body of a man who had been shot
through the back. The only evidence elici-
ted so far is that a youthful couple, in an
agitated frame of mind, were noticed the
night before the discovery, eagerly hunting
for a tram to take them citywards. The
facts seem to point to a verdict of death by
misadventure, caused by what in high mili-
tary circles is called espionage, but what in
the scrub round Sydney is known as touting.
Such a case occurred in Centennial Park,
Sydney, a few years back, when the police
were credited with not being anxious to
find the slayer. At any rate, they never
did find him. A feature of the present
affair was that the deceased was identified
twice. The man first announced as dead
called on the detectives and proved an alibi,
but, even then, the person who had sworn to
his corpse maintained that he had made no
mistake, and, in short, said that, if the
owner of the cadaver persisted in being
alive, lie wasn’t playing the game. He was
so positive that the finger prints of the dead
man were taken, and his true identity
placed beyond doubt. After that the mys-
tery thickened, till it became akin to pea-
soup.
THE APPROACH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Wade yesterday afternoon gave notice of his
intention to move a vote of censure against the
Government regarding the Norton Griffith Go.’s agree-
ment. After a meeting of the Cabinet, lasting for
half an hour, the Premier said the Government would
approach the motion with serene indifference, con-
scious of its own rectitude. — Daily payer.
Fanfare of trumpets. Roll of drums.
Chorus:
Lo! we approach this wretched censure motion!
Why it was launched we haven’t got a notion.
Though all our pledges lie about us shattered,
We cannot see that any really mattered.
(With growing confidence):
Fiends may attack our policy financial!
But we submit our argument's substantial.
We, who got in because we would not borrow,
Will be all right if still on top to-morrow.
Premier Holman (solo):
With indifference serene, see, we saunter to the
scene,
For we’re conscious of our rectitude, you see!
Do not shrink! We will not hurt you, for we’re
simply crammed with virtue,
And we scorn all hints of black insolvency!
Though from figures Wade devises such unneighborly
surprises,
With a view to blowing all our schemes to dust,
We decline to see we’ve rotted, or admit we’ve even
spotted
That new leaf that we were going to turn or bust.
(Cheerful Chorus):
You took us all on trust, and we had to turn or
bust;
And, although we haven’t turned, we don’t agree
That we’ve really gone and buste4—so we must again
be trusted
To produce a sound financial polic-ee!
(Grand Chorus):
To produce a sound financial polic-ee,
You must give Administrations time, you see !
Even though C. G. Wade sniffeth,
At this scheme of Norton Griffith,
We will reconcile you to it presentlee!
We’ll explain our quaint devising,
And our Private Enterprising
In a manner very satisfactoree!
But, of course, we must be trusted!
We repeat—We must be trusted!
Do not ask too many questions! Wait and see!
(Nanki Poo Holman — twanging guitar):
A nervous minstrel, I
A thing of explanations—
Of frothy, light orations,
As sweet as mother’s pie.
My catalogue is old—
But still I do it nicely—
My job I know precisely,
And every song is Gold !
Are you in economic mood ?
I’ll sigh with you !
No borrow, borrow !
On Cohen’s coldness do you brood ?
I’ll do so too !
I’ll charm your willing ears
With tales of saving years,
And calm your lurking fears
Of I O U!
No borrow, borrow!
(Briskly):
But if “national development” is needed,
I am ready with the promises and loans 1
For the plot that bears the Future must be weeded,
And we needn’t heed the Drought’s indecent bones.
Our uncles all in serried ranks assembled
Never quail—or they conceal it if they do.
For my own part I have never, never trembled
For no danger can withstand the lOU.
(Brisk chorus and dance):
Monuments fall an'd nations perish;
Things go to ruin that people cherish;
Nothing withstands the wind and the wet
Like the old, well-rooted National Debt (Wood, wind
and drums).
Hurricane, earthquake, wind and rain
Level the temple with the plain!
But wind, and rain, and earthquake and dew
Can never play up—
Can NEVER play up
With our beautiful, beautiful IOU! !
('Holman, dancing joyously):
And now to gladden our Labor eyes
Comes in old Private Enterprise!
Old enmities we hereby bury,
And say we’re glad to see him —-very.
We bury the hatchet along with the pledge,
And sing and dance on Oblivion’s edge!
But take us out of the mire and wet,
Our truthfulness
Chorus ( thunderously):
Our truthfulness !
Holman : Our faithfulness!
Chorus: OUR FAITHFULNESS!
Holman : Our Truthfulness —our Faithfulness —our
Spotlessness will surprise you yet!
(Marching Finale):
We approach the censure motion with serene in-
diff-er-ence,
Though we haven’t got a notion where we’ve giver,
you offence.

THE MILLINER'S TRIUMPH OVER
EDISON.
HUBBY: “ Hello! Hello! Hello!! Can't hear?
What's that? What’s the matter with
your voice? ”
WI FEY : “ Voice all right, love; but I have
such a large hat on 1 can't get near the
spout."
It is difficult to sentimentalise over ele-
phants, but Sydney Sun tried it the other
evening. A steamer with Wirths’ circus on
board was passing Bradley’s Head, on its way
up the Harbor, when the elephants on board
started to get restive. Suddenly those on
board heard loud trumpetings ashore. Then
somebody remembered that one of the massive
animals was residing temporarilv at the new
Zoological Gardens, now being laid out. The
Sun printed the story and quoted it as an
example of the elephant’s wonderful gift of
knowing when its kind were around, and
making impromptu speeches of welcome at
long ranges. Next evening, it transpired that
the marooned beast had been suffering from
indigestion and bad temper, and had been
presented with a whole bucket of Epsom
salts disguised as a bran mash. He hap-
pened to be swearing about it when his
friends were passing, and thev very natur-
ally felt nervous. So the attempt to wring
some pathos out of the beast like a ruined
cathedral failed. It was a rash experi-
ment, anyhow, to cast him for the part of
Little Willy in the animal version of “East
Lynne.”
Th o prevailing fashion seems to be to
burn the body. It is better than burying it or
sinking it with stones, providing that nobody
notices the smoke —and ' there must be a
considerable volume of smoke when a body
is being treated. Then, to round the grisly
business off nicely (it takes an operator of
considerable nerve to attend steadily to
small details), it is wise to scatter the
ashes to the four winds. But the fire
never seems to do its work thoroughly, and
the four winds are never all on duty at the
same time. And the fragments of non-
inflammable evidence the fiercest fire leaves
won't travel on or be dissipated by the
fiercest wind of the eternal four. The bag-
ging and carrying off of charred evidence
for disposal elsewhere is a risky business,
for the pack-horse with the dreadful burden
may break away, as it did in Queensland
years ago, and be found by the vengeful
searchers—a wandering witness and a car-
rier of death for those concerned. The only
apparent advantage about burning is that
the Law has to set to work laboriously to
prove that there ever was a death or a
body. But the Law is patient and com-
mands a lot of skilled help, so it sometimes
accomplishes its desire even with the few
relics that look like nothing. The only
really safe way is to have no body and no
fire. And even then you may be wrong-
fully charged with somebody else’s body.
Yet, strangely enough, the body that no one
wants to get rid of has a wonderful habit
of disappearing. When a sovereign or gen-
eral dies in battle every undertaker in the
kingdom wants to find him and get the
burial job, and almost everybody else wants
to find him for the sake of the reward. Yet
the Greek emperor Valens is still missing;
also King Baldwin of Constantinople;
James 111. and James IV. of Scotland;
Sebastian of Portugal; Wiswas Bao, who
nominally commanded the Mahratta army
at Paniput; Richard 11. of England ; Moses ;
and quite a lot besides. One Russian Czar,
or heir-apparent, has been absent for over
300 years, and all hope that he will resume
his job has been abandoned. He simply
ran round a corner in the palace grounds
during broad daylight, and never came back.
Wail from a city which an octopus has
squeezed to death :
Time was when Ballarat could hold its head as
high as most, but now few are so poor as to do it
reverence. In the
course of a fortnight
during last month
only one solitary in-
dividual, barring the
officials —to wit, a
junior clerk—went
within the precincts
of the place which
serves for a Supreme
Court, County Court,
Insolvency Court,
and every other old
Court save that of
Petty Sessions. In
the County Court
there are supposed to
be eight sittings per
year. For July two
paltry cases were
listed, and almost
immediately there-
after were settled.
This month not one
case has been set
down for hearing.
And the jest of the
affair is that a Mel-
bourne barrister was
recently appointed a
County Court Judge
specially for the “Golden” City and vicinity, and
for his £l5OO a year is averaging something like
10 seconds of judicial work daily.
The Bulletin’s Old Soldier: One Des-
mond prophesies in the London Alagazine,
that China will ultimately have an army of
30,000.000 men. Aloreover
China would be able to keep the majority of them
in the field, owing to their capacity to fight on a
minimum of rice-food, Europe and the other white
countries, according to military authorities, not be-
ing able to keep a fourth of their “paper” force
actually fighting, chiefly because of the expense of
feeding them.
An essential point which Desmond over-
looks is the vast quantity of “rice-food”
that a Chinaman needs to keep him in
fighting or working trim. Aly experience
with Bhotea coolies —who are more or less
Chinese—on a road-making job once was
that each man required at least 15 sers
(301 b.) of millet meal daily, made either into
the flat cakes called chupatties, or
into a thick porridge. No Chinaman eats much
rice in his own country. It is too expensive.
The food of the cheap colored man is not
nutritious, and he has to make up for the
lack of quality by taking an enormous
quantity of it. A ration of about 41b. or
51b. a day is enough for the white soldier,
and gives him all the nutriment he wants.
It is much easier to transport, too, than
the mass of bulky, cumbrous vegetable mat-
ter required for a colored army. It was
largely that difficulty of food-transport that
stopped the vegetable-and-fish-eating Japs
after Mukden, and forced them to make
peace without getting the indemnity they
so badly wanted.

“Bloore”: Sydney G.P.O. is reducing its
staff, not by reason of the work running
out, or the unpopularity of the Kangaroo
stamp, but simply because Smith and Jones
prefer possible halos to impossible billets.
The mail branch is now two short of its
muster, the pair having, while in a state of
nerves, passed themselves out, after much
wrestling with night work (which should
have been day work). The trouble is there
is not an even distribution of work, some
departments loafing along from 9.30 a.m. to
4.30 p.m., with intervals for morning and
afternoon tea, whilst others less fortunate
take up duty along with the milk-oh ! —and
finish up with the night-watchman. AVhat
time. a harassed supervisor of mails was
blowing out his brains, other fellows were
busy picking the first in the handicap, or
writing out applications for sick leave.

“Feng-shui,” of Shanghai, considers
suicide as a political argument:—
Suicide, as an argument, is unanswerable. You
cannot appeal to the reason of a corpse. He gets
the better of you every time. He has all the sym-
pathy of the crowd. When a Chinese official objects
to the policy of the Government, or can’t get his
pay, or is seized with a desire to make himself dis-
agreeable anyhow, he writes a swan song of 49
pages, retires to his country house and drinks the
hemlock. His swan song is posted up in all the
provinces—nowadays it is telegraphed to all sta-
tions —and runs into 14 editions; and the Govern-
ment, to appease the general indignation, has to
provide explanations and apologies. There are great
possibilities in the suicide business. If Chamber-
lain had gracefully cut his throat on the floor
of the House, England, in a burst of sentimental
excitement, would have adopted Protection on the
spot. If the brothers Redmond, after a frenzied
appeal, would expire in each other’s arms on the
steps of the Victoria Monument, Home Rule would
DRY ART.

instead of expending genius, ink and office stationerv
on leading articles, were to commit hara-kiri outside

things ; but, knowing what “the East” is, I'm most
interested in the railway.
“Kola”: There, was a meeting of peace
cranks at Melbourne a few days ago, and
great applause greeted the remark of one
speaker “that Air. H. Wilkinson had shown,
in the Argus, that Japan had no intention
of invading Australia.” Unfortunately no
one appeared to guarantee Air. Wilkinson
(whoever he is). So I am writing to-day
to my friend the Alikado of Japan, asking
him to state whether Air. Wilkinson has his
authority or blessing; and, as a further
guarantee of good faith, I am requesting
him (the said Alikado) to stop building war-
ships and to demobilise his army. When I
get the Alikado’s reply I shalf send it to
you for publication. Until then I shall
continue to boost our army and navy along,
and my two kids will attend their drill regu-
larly.
The South Melbourne aldermen, acting
on information received, or going by their
sense of smell, or something, investigated
the State schools in their municipality the
other day, and this is what they found: Out
of six large schools only two were fit for
use, and even there the sanitary conveni-
ences were bad and totally inadequate. At
the third, a weatherboard barn, filthy and
dilapidated, does duty for the fourth-grade
scholars. There is hardly a sound pane in
any of the windows, and a carpenter who
was lately engaged to re-glaze the windows
declined to tackle the job—the wood was
too rotten. The paint has long since van-
ished from the walls. In the fourth, a
brick building, the interior walls had not
been cleaned or painted for 20 years! Light-
ing and ventilation were disgraceful, and in
one room (18ft. by 20ft.) 50 children were
being taught. The fifth and sixth were
found to be badly lighted, ill-venlilated, and
generally dilapidated, and in both these there
is a lot of sickness among the scholars.
Alonths ago the last Alinister of Education
7 —the rejected Edgar—promised to have tHese
interiors painted. Presumably the present
Alinister, Peacock, will repeat the promise,
and his successor also, and so on till the
structures fall into a condition of insanitary
ruin. And these are metropolitan schools!
Heaven knows what the academies are like
in outlying places, where a Alinister never
happens, and even the local member is a
stranger. Yet the State compels children
to nass several hours a day in these dens.
There can be no excuse of want of money
so long as there is sufficient cash to support
a sub-Excellency and staff, a House of Rich
Landlords, and similar unessentials, sufficient
in themselves to keep all the schools in the
State in decent repair.
THE UNDRESSED SEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
What is patent to the least observant nowadays is
that women wear almo-t nothing under their gowns
even in the day time. Petticoats went some time
back, and were replaced by tights, or not replaced
at all. The stockings are of such diaphanous silk
as to embarrass the beholder who sees, even in the
street, so much of them. Over this is worn a thin,
filmy sheath of half-transparent material, cut almost
as low by day as by night, and with such slashings
and liftings of the skirt as may display the leg
half-way to the knee. —London Times.
Oh, woman in our hour of need,
Who dressed at such tremendous cost,
Inform us is it true, indeed,
That all your under-things are lost,
And that you stalk the cities in
A garment like another skin —-
That old-time petticoats are not,
And man has got
To mate now with the sans culotte !
We see you wear the finest hose
Of silk or quite transparent lisle,
And that your blouses low disclose
What Wowsers call the corpus vile;
We note the skirt that closely clings,
And rather more than hints at things
Like shins, and calves, and well-shaped knees—
And by degrees,
’Tis hinted, you’ll abandon these!
The shock is great; and yet with tact
You break the change. With little fuss
You draw attention to the fact
That fig trees here are numerous.
’Tis well ! Like Eve you soon may dress ;
Then new Spring goods will cost us less....
But, no! Our womenldnd may keep
A fashion steep
Or mad, but never one that’s cheap !

THE MAN IN
THE BOX.
S HE: “Are you sure that is not her husband.”
HE : “Quite. Only an excellent imitation.”
The Southern Europeans who flock to
Westralia keep the law busy. On the gold-
fields, where they are most numerous, the
foreigners are constantly in the courts. In
Kalgoorlie, the other day, a Greek was up
for indecently assaulting a 10-year-old girl.
Simultaneously, a coroner’s inquest was
being held on an Austrian who had been
killed with a blow from a glass bottle. A
few weeks previously, an Italian girl, su-
ing her employer, a countryman, for wages,
proved that she had been imported under
contract, and the affair looked remarkably
like white slavery. In another court, an
Austrian was asking compensation for a
house and furniture destroyed by fire, and
evidence showed that the house was a low
sly-groggery, and that the fire was caused by
the upsetting of a lamp during a drunken
orgy. The State’s empty spaces need filling,
but it would be better if they could be filled
by the blondes of the North.
The story of how a gentle Australian
girl declined to be financially victimised
was told in a Victorian police court last
week. A “diagnosing palmist” of mature
years (possibly something like the Mr.
Maunder of Jupp’s tales) called at her
house and offered to “read her palm.” While
she was away washing the palm the astro-
loger, or whatever he was, is said to have
found and pocketed her purse. At all events
the purse was missing. She asked him for
it. “What do you insinuate?” he demanded,
trembling with what might have been either
righteous annoyance or fear or alcoholic
nerves. She replied frankly that theft was
what she insinuated. “If it were not for
decency’s sake I would ask you to search
me,” he said. “I am going to search you
anyhow,” she replied. “Hand over your
coat.” Coat, waistcoat, and yes—it is use-
less to conceal it further —trousers were suc-
cessively removed and proffered to the
heroine. Joan of Arc couldn’t have been
more heroic. She found all her money bar-
ring half a crown, and that she ultimately
discovered in the lining of the oldster’s tall
hat, and pocketed despite the ancient’s
frantic assertion that he always kept half
a crown in the lining of his hat as a reserve
fund. He fled in a humiliated and cr'Mt-
tered condition, like a State treasurer ho
having, in a manner of speaking, deposi.ed
his last pair of boots on the ] a win hop
counter, has been told harshly, by ihe
Hebrew proprietor that the secur is rot
only insanitary but rotten, and t; r be
doesn’t get out of the .establishmeni i s-’im •
order, he will run the risk of being I nlcn 1
for attempting to get money by means of a
trick.
Melb. City Council is wisely waver-
ing on the question of the Sunday-closing of
picture shows. The police are not in favor
of it. Nobody is in favor of it save the
Wowsers, who object to Sunday “work.” Also
they object to Sunday happiness, and they
hate mirth on Monday, and joy and play
on Tuesday, and revelry and leg-show on
Wednesday, and wassail on Thursday, and
pleasure and cakes and ale on Friday. They
hate with an especial hatred banquet and
dance and song and honey and mead on
Saturday. And if anybody smiles next Sun-
day it drives them mad and makes them
throw their Bible in the eye of the whole
human race. Likewise if a fellow takes his
girl to the seashore on the ensuing Monday
they go crazy. On the ensuing Tuesday they
are naturally removed to a lunatic asylum.
The rival coastal hamlets of Sydney and
Melbourne are endeavoring to prove by
shouting and recrimination that their re-
spective harbor entrances, if properly
dredged, are quite deep enough for the
big ships now hurrying out to this part
of the world. While the long uproar
proceeds, the Watson’s Bay visitor can
see, on almost any fine morning, deep-
laden garbage punts towing
out through Sydney Heads
and unloading their filth and
rubbish close enough for the
ocean currents to bring it
in again end make work for
the dredges that attend to the
channels. The same variety
of submarine foolishness
helps to make work in Mel-
bourne’s skimming dish of a
port. These remarks have
been inspired by the fact
that artillery practice at
Sydney Heads was stopped,
the other morning, by the
intrusion of a wallowing
rubbish punt, which, despite
the regulations, crawled
slowly across the line of fire.
Now the firing away of am-
munition is a very necessary
military exercise; but the
dropping of rubbish on the
sea doorstep is an unneces-
sary curse. Yet the curse
seems to be performed with
care and regularity, whereas
the gun practice is hurried
through at intervals, and only when the
last banana skin and pint of mud has pol-
luted the not-so-de'ep.

From the Oldest Inhabitant
Inspector Anderson, formerly of the N.S.W. police
force, died last week. His retirement came about
under peculiar circumstances. Quarter of a century
ago Sydney had a philanthropist who was widely
known as the Good Samaritan. His philanthropy
took the form of providing wheel chairs for cripples
and invalids. This means of locomotion enabled
them to appear in the streets, and they established
themselves at street corners and in the parks, selling
trifles, or openly seeking coin. The number in-
creased, and the nuisance became serious. The
public made loud complaint to the police and
through the newspapers. The City Superintendent,
Mr. Reid, at last called upon Inspector Anderson to
put down the nuisance, remarking that if he could
not do it someone else must. Anderson at once
resigned. In his own words, he went home, hung
his uniform on a peg in the passage of his house,
and told his family that he had used it for the
last time. His successor cleared the streets of the
wheel-chair mendicants, and they have not re-
appeared since. Mr. Anderson retired on a pension
of £325, which he drew for over 23 years. The
later history of Sydney’s Good Samaritan is un-
known. The same may be said of Palestine’s Good
Samaritan. (
A BREAD AND CHEESE QUESTION.
THE BRIDE: “I am utterly miserable without
you.”
BEIDRGROOM: “But I've got to go down to
the office , dear, to make a living .”
THE BRIDE: “Well, that may be so. But
don't you think it’s selfish of you?"
Father O’Donnell, Tasmania’s political
priest, the other day plainly implied that
Ministers were spending public money freely
in districts where they had private mining
interests, while starving more deserving but
less fortunate places. Instead of shooting a
writ at his adversary, or denying the charges
or promising an official inquiry into his
conduct, Minister of Mines Mulcahy
wrote to the priest’s archbishop, complain-
ing that “this was not the first time O’Don-
nell had unfairly criticised the members of
the Government.” Now, the priest is asking
the Minister whether he thinks it a manly
or dignified proceeding to run to a man’s
superior officer in this way.
THE HELPER.
Mr. W. B. CriFin, of Chicago, the winner of the
design for the Federal capital at Canberra, arrived
in Sydney yesterday by the Sonoma. Mr. Griffin said
that while he was here he would do all he could for
Australia. —News item.
Poor , decrepit old Australia.
Retort courteous from a perfect lady
rounding on the arresting constable in a
recent Melbourne suburban court case
Who is likely to care what you think? I am
sure that when 'their Worships look at your fat feet
and your mutton head they understand that, at anv-
rate, nature sometimes succeeds in making both ends
meat.
It was, no doubt, the same perfect lady who,
when sued by a neighbor for slander, told
the Court complainant’s hair was so red
that if she put her head out of the window
the butcher brought corned beef.
“N. or M.”: The
picturesque old sailing
craft that go lumber-
ing round the water-
ways of Australia,
mostly with loads of
timber, have been hay-
ing a rough time of it
lately. Even when a
ship is young a hold
full of blue-gum is a
ponderous cargo_ to
be caught with in a
storm ; and most _of
the wooden sailing
vessels are so far from
young that they are
about due for their
old-age pensions. The
old Cassa is at pres-
ent laid up in a
Hobart dock with a
hole punctured in the
side. The Helen, one
of McGregor’s ships
built for the China
tea trade, had to run
for shejter and repairs
to Melbourne and dis-
charge cargo there in-
stead of making South
Australia as intended.
The Zephyr barquen-
tine, ■ also bound for
S.A., has beached its
bones on Chinaman’s
Reef, off Maria
Island (Tas.). The
Zephyr, by the way,
was a Sydney-built
boat dating back to
’66. And the Rachel
Cohen, carrying stores
for the two hungry
camps on Macquarie
Island, was swept
right out of its course
by gales, and eventu-
ally, in a damaged and dishevelled condi-
tion, was blown to Stewart Island,
down south of Maoriland. Mawson’s men
and the oil-extracting men who pervade
Macquarie Island must, in the meantime,
have been sustaining an exasperated exist-
ence on lessee Hatch’s penguins. But who
was the genius who sent a small sailing
craft plodding on such an errand among the
midwinter gales? And why should a craft
named Rachel Cohen have been sent? No
Jew ever made a great success of the sea.
This epistle, smelling distinctly of fried
fish, arrived at The Bulletin office re-
cently :
To Da Newspaper: By cripe, we showa da way to
da Englese in da sport! We beeeomea da ger-r-reat

bloomin’ mad in da la crosse. By jimpiny, we da

The cause of all the excitement is evidently
the winning of the South Aus. Amateur Bil-
liard Championship by Angelo Demodena.
With 4056 weddings last year South Aus.
is pluming itself on having the highest mar-
riage rate in the Commonwealth instead of
the lowest, which it used to have about a.d.
1900, and the second-highest in the
world. The State’s religious sym-
pathies came out in the fact that
1318 of the knots were tied by
Methodist ministers, 400 bv Roman
Catholics, and onlv 173 by regis-
trar. The death-rate was 10.28
the lowest in the world bar Maori-
land —and the birthrate 28.65,
which is not enormous, but leaves
a good margin. But, unfortu-
nately, the Central State last year
attracted only one-third as many
new citizens per ship as it got the
other way.
One of those stories which tend
to destroy one’s faith in human
nature was related last Thursday.
It was to the effect that Westell, of
the Westralia n pearl fisheries, had
died leaving £200,000 to Tunstall,
corporation laborer, of Bolton
(England). It was added, how-
ever, that no one in Westralia knew
Westell, and that Tunstall couldn’t
be found, so the story was a footless yarn
without a leg. Possibly, in some hidden
fashion it was an advt. of a new meat
extract.
They have an amiable youn£ athlete teach-
ing physical exercise to sweet girl-graduates
of the Education Department in Melbourne.
When he started his first lessons to the
young teachers the other day, being too diffi-
dent to use the word “breast,” he said:
“When I say ‘One,’ bring your clenched
hands smartly to the sternum —so. One !”
And every girl brought her hands smartly
together behind, her.

A CHANCE FOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.
The Itinerarv Committee reported that Mr. Cook, the Prime Minister, had instructed it “to do the thing well” and had given it £lOOO from ihp Trensiirv for the
purpose. The committee also reported that Dr. J. W. Barrett had contributed £2000, and Mr. George Fairbairn £5OO IdoK of to the

The Empire Parliamentary Branch of Australia is now receiving subscriptions to defray the cost of the forthcoming visit of British Parliamentarians.


Money being now scarce, the N. S. Wales Govern-
ment has had to give up the idea of bribing its way
back to office, and has started to bluff through, instead
On a rough calculation the Moiman-McOow en Govern-
ment has turned the first sods and otherwise pulled the leg of the country over
works which would cost £10,000,000; and all of it is bluff, for the Treasury is
empty, and there isn’t a ghost of an idea when it will be anything else hut empty.

writes Mr. Duncan 11. Stevens, South Street, Feild-

work. I could not stand for hours, but applied
Chamberlain’s Pain Balm freely, and after applying
it once the next day was quite recovered.”*

BISHOP MERCER (Tas.), who has
announced his intention of retiring.
Gone to the stars he loved so well, Edward
John White, F.R.A.S., of South Yarra
(Vic.). He was born at Bristol (Eng.) in
1831, educated in his native town and came
to Australia with the gold fever in 1853.
He was then a mechanical engineer; but
being at heart an astronomer, he soon joined
the Melbourne Observatory, where he be-
came Chief Assistant and at odd times Act-
ing Government Astronomer. He received
his fellowship in 1869, and had charge of the
party that watched the transit of Venus at
Hobart in 1882. He compiled the general
star catalogue issued by the Melbourne Ob-
servatory, wrote many valuable papers read
before the Royal Society of Victoria, and
was the intimate scientific and personal
chum of the Sydneyside star-gazer, John
Tebbutt.
C. J. DENNIS, author of “Backblock
Ballads,” and a well-known BULLETIN
contributor.
Old James Balfour, who had been in and
out of Victorian politics for just on 50
years, died in Melbourne on Sunday. After
a hard Scotch University and business train-
ing, Balfour came out to the Hentys, and a
few years later married James Henty’s
daughter. He never broadened an inch, and,
in spite of his great financial and commer-
cial experience, no Premier ever ventured to
give him office, though Duncan Gillies and
Alan McLean made him an hon. Minister.
Nevertheless, he hung on to a seat long
enough to become the oldest member of the
House of Rich Landlords.
“Chudah”: Pastor Lenzer has reached his
“Silver Jubilee” in charge of the East Mel-
bourne Synagogue. The man is a remark-
able instance of pluck and energy. He was
only engaged as chazan, or chanter, under
Pastor Isidore Myers, and he came with a
very slight knowledge of English. In 18
months Myers resigned, and went to Amer-
ica. Lenzer was still very deficient in Eng-
lish, but his familiarity with Hebrew and
Talmudic lore enabled him to carry on the
services. Placing himself under an English
master, he was able in six months to preach
in the vernacular. The outcome was his
permanent appointment, whereupon he at-
tacked the heavy financial liabilities which
had brought the Synagogue to the brink of
ruin, and had scared away the studious
recluse, Myers. Regular correspondence
with the rabbis of Jerusalem, Jaffa, Tiber-
ias, etc., renders Lenzer’s name familiar in
Palestine : and he was instrumental in per-
suading Kronheimer, who had made much
money in Melbourne out of tobacco, to build
12 houses for the poor of Jerusalem. I re-
marked to an old friend of his that he looked
like a Wagnerian basso. The friend said
that he was one ; but I must leave it at that.
By the way, I have called him pastor, being
assured that there are but two, or it may
be three, duly qualified rabbis in Australian
synagogues.
Joseph Oreer, who was buried last week
at Rookwood (N.S.W. L was, though claimed
as a Liberal, one of the stoutest champions
N.S.W. has had for a vigorous Protectionist
daily newspaper. He fought for the old
Globe in tempestuous style, and when that
journal tottered at the close of Gresley
Lukin’s connection with it, he turned a
devouring eye on Sydney’s Protectionist
capitalists. Whenever he met one of them
in the street, he rushed his quarry against
the nearest hoarding, and demanded to know
what was the use of professing Protection-
ism if he didn’t back it with a few thou-
sands. Captitalists after a time used to
jump into a cab when they saw Joseph in
the distance. At that time he was a wiry
little man, sporting strange whiskers, and
wagging a bitter tongue. When he got into
Parliament, his manner and appearance
caused Parkes to catalogue him (Parkes
was given to Zoo cataloguing) as a
“withered tarantula.” a nickname which
made the little man wild. The Dibbs party,
coming into power, gave Joe a job, and he
drew Government pay till he was past 70.
“Henry Horsecollar” writes an obituary:
Dead, at the great age of 88, Emile Ollivier, the French
Prime Minister, who entered on the disastrous Franco-
German war of 1870, as he said, “with a light
heart.” Ollivier was a grievously misunderstood
man. The wretched, diseased Emperor had tried to
pacify the people and prop up his falling dynasty
—which never really looked up after its great dis-
aster in Mexico —by establishing Ministerial Govern-
ment on the British plan, but he did everything of
importance behind the back of his Cabinet, and that
body hadn’t time to get a firm seat in the saddle
before the crash came. The Emperor, so far as is
known, was no Bonaparte, but only the illegitimate
son of a Bonaparte’s wife and one of her many
lovers. He was a short-legged man with a dull
countenance, and a wonderful capacity for dreams
and aspirations. He was the illimitable loser of the
’bus. In 1870 he was such a physical wreck that
even his dog used to turn him out of his chair, and
he merely uttered a sigh, and shifted to another
chair, leaving the dog in possession.
When Bismarck started to provoke war by aiming
carefully devised insults at this pathetic ruin, there
were frenzied councils. Incompetent old generals
like Leboeuf assumed a blood-drinking attitude
and clamored for immediate action. The
strenuous Spanish Empress reckoned that only a
successful campaign could wipe out the recollection
of the Mexican breakdown, and prevent a revolution,
and save the throne for her son. France staggered
into the great trouble like a somnambulist, and
Ollivier, who had done his best to keep her out of
it, stood up with a heart of lead and a brave smile
on his face, and put the best aspect on things. It
wasn’t a time for telling the truth, so he lied man-
fully, but that cheerful falsehood was remembered
against him all the rest of his days.
Then the French voluntary-service army, which
crawled at the rate of about five miles per day, went
out to meet the compulsory-service army of
Prussia, which could do 15 miles any day.
Bazaine presently got the chief command. He was
a short, fat, flushed man with large brown eyes like
those of a Newfoundland dog. Some people said he
had a trusting expression. Some people said he was
a shifty coward. Some people said he ought to be
charged dog-tax. His first wife was a lady of loose
character, whom he met plying the oldest of the
world’s professions under a lamp-post. He poisoned
her, according to report (the man in the street and
the bald-headed commercial-traveller at the back of
the omnibus both attested it), so that he might
marry a Mexican heiress during the great French
adventure in Mexico. When Benito Juarez chased the
French out of his country, that most strenuous Presi-
dent confiscated the property on the ground that the
Mexican heiress was a traitor, so Bazaine might as
well have stuck to the Rahab of the lamp-post.
Bazaine went to the war accompanied by concubines
and carriages and pianos, and did the most amazing
surrender in recent history. He was sentenced to
death for treason. Then he was let off with 20
years’ imprisonment. He escaped because nobody
really wanted to be troubled with him. In
his latter days his son was a sergeant in the
Spanish army, and the old French marshal and one-
time commander-in-chief lived on what Bazaine,
junior, could spare out of his scanty pay. He was
at one time a familiar figure in old Madrid, potter-
ing round with a basket on his arm in search of
cheap vegetables for dinner. France produced great
men and great heroes in the later stages of the
war, when Napoleon 111. and his gang of decayed
scoundrels were got rid of. But about the best of
the old lot was Ollivier, who has just passed out —the
gallant perjurer who went into the war “with a light
heart” because there was nothing left to do but put
a good face on the impending catastrophe.
ARTHUR GRIFFITH,
of Holman’s Government
(N.S.W.).
Roland Fer-
rers Pickering,
known for many
years as
“N e m o,” a
sporting writer,
has died, at
Gosf o r d
(N.S.W.), aged
66 years. He
was born in
Pitt-street, Syd-
ney, on May
28, 1847. His
father was
George Ferrers
Pickering, a
barrister: his
mother a daugh-
ter of Captain
Ellis. On his
arrival Picker-
ing, sen., adopt-
ed the profes-
sion of journal-
ism, and became
part proprietor
and editor of
Bell’s Life in
Sydney. Hi s
partner was one
Garrett. “Row-
ley” was edu-
cated at Sydney
Grammar
School, and his
love for sport
by degrees led
him to sporting
journalism. For
many years he
was horse editor
of the S. M.
Herald and
Sydney Mail.
On retirement
he took to a
country life, and
lived near Gos-
ford.
During the discussion in the House of
Reps., upon the propriety of Attorney-
General Irvine holding a retainer for the
Marconi Co., which is in litigation with the
Commonwealth, the case of Mr. Isaacs (and
now Justice) was mentioned; but both
parties agreed to forget an earlier instance.
Acting-Chief Justice Barton and the late
Justice R. E. O’Connor were Attorney-
General and Minister for Justice respec-
tively in the Dibbs Ministry of 1893. A
contractor sued the Commissioners for Rail-
ways, and Barton and O’Connor accepted
briefs against the Commissioners. On an
adjournment motion Solemn Lee drew atten-
tion to the circumstances, and the adjourn-
ment was carried against the Government
by 69 to 48. The case came to court, but
by then Barton and O’Connor had resigned.
SPEAKER HARRY MORTON,
N.S. IV. Assembly.
The annual municipal elections are ap-
proaching in Victoria. Among the aspir-
ants is a Chinaman, who thinks he is good
enough for his own decayed mining
town. He was taking his own re-
quisition around, and on putting it
before one housewife, she asked him if he
was in favor of having the drain in front
of her place cleaned out. “My word,” he
said —and went straight away and brought
a shovel to do the work. Other aspirants
are fearful of the example. It is too sud-
den.
Died last week, at the Hospice of the
Little Sisters of the Poor at Northcote
(Vic.), James Ross, who came to Port
Phillip with John Batman in 1835, he being
then 21 years old. His father was a car-
penter employed by Batman. Ross the car-
penter bought at the first land sale (June,
1837), the half-acre forming the north-east
corner of Collins-street and Elizabeth-street.
He gave £32 for it, and after holding it a
few years was induced to cut it up, and got
as much as £2 per foot for it. The scrap of
land or pint of dust was valued in 1888 at
£493,500.
Crossed Jordan, the Rev. George Hay,
of Sydney, who had dodged the “marriage
shop” legislation in N. S. Wales for good-
ness knows how long. The Rev. George was
the choir invisible, verger, elder and pastor
of the Independent Presbyterian Church,
which was located at Campsie or there-
abouts. It didn’t absolutely rank with St.
Peter’s or Milan Cathedral, and if this paper
remembers aright, the fane was once seized
for debt. Later on he was prepared to hitch
up all and sundry who had half a sovereign,
and cared to drop into his office in Eliza-
beth-street. When he was doing business
opposite the Government Printing Office he
made good wages, but competition grew
keener of late years, and the eye of authority
grew keener too. So the old chap’s “incum-
bency” became a precarious one, although
he put transparencies of the Saints on his
office window. In much earlier years he
was a regular meenister of the Presbyterian
Church, and it was one of his gentle boasts
that he was just about the onlv parson in
the world who had had a good slab from
one of his sermons printed in The Bulle-
tin. The trouble with old Hay was that
he was a rebel or free-lance bv instinct, and
couldn’t run in harness. The successful
parson requires a guarantee, the same as a
family horse. He mustn’t be a jibber or a
bolter; he must be accustomed to wear
blinkers; he mustn’t become excited when
the rein gets under his tail; also, he must
stand untied in town, and be fond of sugar,
and sniff with his nose in a friendly manner
at little children. George Hay answered
to none of these requirements. He never
stood untied anywhere.
ALWAYS LIE LIKE H—LL BEFORE ELECTIONS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[Ballad in the Vaudeville or Musical Comedy
manner, suggested mainly by the impressive pro-
grammes of the absurdly impotent Cook and Hol-
man Ministries.]
A crowd of blokes was gathered in a cheerful city
bar,
And in their midst an Ag£d Statesman stood ;
He spoke of things political, and all from near and
far
Drew close, to do themselves a bit of good.
He talked of scotching trusts while leaving com-
panies alone,
Of sinking prices to the rock called “bed,”
Of giving all hands incomes free, and houses of their
own,
And then these thoughtful words he softly said.
Chorus:
Always he like ll—ll before elections;
Pull the voters' legs by day and night;
If yer foiler the above directions
Things with you will always turn out right.
Tell the truth, of course, when nothing’s doin’
(Britons never grudge a man ’is play),
But not, unless yer hankerin’ fer roo-in
Within, well say, six munce uv pollin’ day.
And then this fine old citizen consumed another beer,
And told, in language picturesque and free,
A score of tales concerning his political career
Of priceless worth alike to you and me.
He said he’d told the Wowsers that he’d have the
pubs shut up,
And praised pubs to the drunks the self-same day;
He mentioned how he’d gulled the Tyke, and foiled
the Yellow Pup,
And then he very earnestly did say.
Chorus:
Always lie like H — ll, etc.
Another round of drinks was brought and eagerly
consumed,
What time that splendid politician told
How Dives had been soothed with pledges that he’d
be “resumed,”
While Lazarus was cynically sold
With yarns about taxation that would render Dives
mad,
And put the squatter class to utter rout;
He proved that Anarchy was good; he likewise
proved it bad.
And then, with shining eyes, did loudly shout.
Chorus:
Alwaysh lie like II —ll before Elecshinsh, etc.
As whisky followed lager beer, and rum succeeded
gin,
The mysteries of Party Government
Were laid completely bare for the frequenters of
that inn ;
We learned that he who’d stay in Parliament
Must be a sound Freetectionist, a Popish Orangeman,
A Socialist and Liberal as well;
And just as all to chant these words respectfully
began,
Upon the bar-room floor our mentor fell.
Chorus :
Alshays liesh like ’ellsh before elecshionsh,
Pullsh she votersh leggsh by (hie, whoop, sh-sh-sh-
shsh, dash, Oh, Lordsh! etc.)

When the hard pruning was done in 1904 each £5
pref. share had to be changed for a new one of 30s.
and a deferred share of 55., and each ordinary £5
share got a new one of Is. But so that ordinaries
might benefit by any recovery in the value of the
old assets, it was provided that whatever the pro-
perties realised in excess of the new valuations
should be put to a special reserve fund. Deferred
shares are also to get the benefit of this accumula-
tion. As a matter of fact, values improved sub-
stantially after 1904, as this next table shows:—

A cautious policy seems to have been adopted with
regard to the valuation of unsold remnants, and the
directors believe that “the realisation of the remain-
ing properties at reasonable prices will very materi-
ally increase” the £86,474 now to the credit of this
special fund. Meantime, while they are not handling
any of the principal, the ordinary and deferred
shares are getting something by way of interest.
Their capital is £32,405; on that and the special
reserve combined they are drawing approximately 4

In June, 1905, there was £316,857 of the old
securities on hand; there is now only £71,636. That,
of course, is book value; but, judging by the interest
earnings ( £3137) for the past half-year, the market
value is more than that—which means that some-
thing considerable remains to be added to the Special
reserve abovementioned. As money has come in from
these sales it has been used in new advances and in
paying off deposits. The latter have shrunk a good
deal; probably there wasn’t the business available
to keep the money profitably occupied. Certainly
the depositors themselves need not have lifted the
money on account of any anxiety. The total liabili-
ties at present are £281,464, and the assets total
£587,994, showing more than £2 for every £1
which the bank owes. In fact, after using the liquid
assets to pay off liabilities as far as they would go,
there would be just upon £3 of non-liquid assets
against every £1 of the remaining debt. The de-
positor is all right. Probably it is the borrower who
is shy. For the most part, no doubt, money is tight
in Australia ; all the same, this isn’t the only bank
which seems to be suffering more from a scarcity of
good borrowers than of good lenders.

wear and tear —in other words, provision for repairs
and replacements. Two methods of book-keeping
may be adopted by a shipping co. Either the esti-
mated amount by which plant, ships, etc., have de-
preciated may be deducted from profits and a cor-
responding amount struck off from the book-value of
the plant, or the plant may be kept in at cost, and a
depreciation fund, built up out of disclosed profits,
may be maintained on the other side of the balance
sheet. This co. puts the ships, etc., into its accounts
at cost, and has a depreciation fund on the other
side. The fund represents, or is supposed to re-
present, the amount by which the assets have actu-
ally depreciated, and it is not therefore a true re-
serve; hence the reserves are described in the table
as “nominal.” This fund, along with a fund for
special renewals, amounts to £82,383. The balance
( £48,463) is something nearer the true reserves—
assuming always that only a fair thing has been
provided for wear and tear, and that the assets are
now, by reason of depreciation, actually worth
£82,383 less than they cost the co. Reserves of
£48,463 look pretty poor, considering the fine years
that shipping cos. have had; but they are really
better than they look, because in 1904 almost the
whole of the reserves were used up in doubling the
capital. And, as hinted just now, it is more than
possible that the provision for wear and tear has
been unnecessarily liberal, in which case part of
the Depreciation Fund is also a true reserve.
The recent history of the co. may be looked at
another way:—
June, ’OB. Dec.,’l2. June, ’l3.
Steamships and other
non-liquid assets .. £187,269 £330,090 £337,014
Liquid assets.. .. 65,336 53,189 60,246
Liabilities . . .. 42,344 53,436 53,954
In the past five years £60,800 has been paid into
the co. for shares and in premiums. So we get this
result: Liquid assets were £22,992 in excess of
liabilities five years ago and are £6292 in excess of
them now—a shrinkage of £16,700. Thus of the
£149,745 which has been put into ships and other
such assets in the past five years, £60,800 has
come from shareholders, £16,700 from former accu-
mulations and £72,245 from current revenue. As
4 p.c. p.a. on all the non-liquid assets as at June,
1908, would require only £37,454, it is quite plain
that something considerably more than fair depreci-
ation has been made over and above the dividend.
And the dividend is none too bad, seeing that of the
present £204,000 of capital, £75,000 was the result
of a division of bonus shares. Six months ago the
directors were very mournful over the increase in
wages, etc., without a corresponding increase in
freights. _ Some freights have been bumped still
higher since then ; and if this co. hasn’t participated
in them, the figures still show that it can over-do its
distress. There are some other people who are really
worse off.

Six months ago the directors of the Equity cele-
brated the co.’s 25th anniversary, and became garru-
lous. They actually said this much: “Shareholders
will be glad to know that the profits earned by the
co. during its 50th half-year, and the number of
new estates placed in its hands during the same
period, are both in excess of any previous half-year.”
Then they relapsed into silence, and will probably
stay so for another 25 years. Not a thing is told
that the law doesn’t bid them tell. Even the value
of the estates in hand isn’t mentioned; and in the
Profit and Loss account all receipts from business
and investments are presented in a heap. Very little
more can therefore be said about the co. than is
evident from the table printed above. The paid
capital is £25,000, and shareholders are liable for
another £lOO,OOO. This £25,000 and the reserves
are invested soundly, so far as one can tell. At
any rate, £35,083 is in public securities, £15,962
in office premises, which are probably worth more
than that, £9970 in book debts (after providing
for all considered doubtful), and the small balance
is mostly cash. The position has been much im-
proved in the last few years:—

Liquid assets .. .. £13,976 £36,151
Other assets . . . . 21,461 26,433
Liabilities . . . . 50 Nil
The Bulletin can’t tell for certain, but the co.’s
investments, apart from the business, must be now
earning close on 10 p.c. on the capital. And the
business is no doubt very profitable; in the past
18 months, after paying a dividend averaging 20 p.c.
p.a., an amount in excess of one-sixth of
the paid capital has been put to reserves. No doubt
high values, both rental and capital, have greatly
increased the commissions, and these are liable to
ease presently; but it seems almost impossible for
the co. to lose much principal in its investments.
Further, as an increasing proportion of trustee work
is bound to be done by trustee cos., and as this co.’s
standing is good, shareholders’ prospects are excel-
lent—-always assuming that the management can
steer clear of the rocks that wait for the trustee.
And that shouldn’t be hard, for the course is pretty
well charted_ now; and when the skipper of the
trustee ship is in doubt about his sailing directions,
he has the advantage of being able to consult the
marine court in advance, “costs to come out of the
estate.” There are a lot of points in favor of
working for an owner who is dead.

This co. has no luck worth mentioning. Years ago
when it was a baby it had an idea that the Sydney
wool business would move across the Harbor, where
North Shore railway would land a lot of the
stuff right into the stores. So an expensive water-
frontage was bought opposite Circular Quay, and
there the P.F.A. s stores stand alone. This isolation
meant providing extensive premises in the city later
on , also, m course of time, it meant getting accom-
modation in Darling Harbor for the produce trade
But the co. s bad luck hung to it, for the Govern-
ment came along and resumed the Darling Harbor
site, and then there was a row about compensation.
Ihe first Courts verdict was in the co.’s favor-
then, by two to one, the Full Court upset it. Now
the co. is going to the Privy Council. Between
law costs, drought and shortage of the wool clip
falling-off in property transactions and consequently
in commissions, and increase in store, carters’ and
other wages, the year’s profits have been crushed
hne. After allowing the usual rebate to shareholders
who are also customers, there isn’t enough over for
a dividend. Still shareholders are used to that •
? f l? 09 there was a dry stage of over 10 years’
Of late the heaviest millstone round the co.’s neck
has no doubt been the big store which has worried
successive Admirals. There has been for years past—
probably there always has been—a heavy mortgage
on these misplaced premises; hence, though a lot of
energy has been put into the business, and though
the turnover has been quite satisfactory, the struggle
with dead horses and lame ducks must have been
pretty wearying. And the figures don’t look very
cheerful even now :

The co. is in the ineat-freezing as well as the wool
and produce broking business. The plant for this
is costly and subject to considerable depreciation.
Something is written off profits against wear and
tear; but whether it is enough there is no way of
checking. There is, however, probably nothing to
complain of in that respect. Directors who could
show as much profit as these have done and pay as
little in dividends would scarcely hesitate to deal
frankly with the depreciation fund. Most times,
when depreciation is not allowed for, it is because
directors haven’t the pluck to hurt shareholders’ feel-
ings. In this case shareholders have by this time
been trained not to have any feelings.

Walker’s are having the time of their life. Every-
where in Australia it has been borrow and boom.
Railway lines have been pushed out, settlement has
been promoted, seasons have been good, traffic has
been unprecedented, and engines have been in furious
demand. How incapable the present rolling-stock is
of shifting the traffic may be judged by the fact
that in N. S. Wales it is now certain there will be a
large carry-over of wheat till next season. Accord-
ing to one authority that ought to be good, when
the new wheat starts to come into the stations early
in December there will be already stacked there as
much as the railways could handle in two months.
N. S. Wales, being now the only State with an im-
ported railway chief, may be the most shocking
example; but the others have had to hustle so as
not to fall behind too, and part of the result of
the hustle has been to fill Walker’s with orders and
keep the works going at high pressure. Meantime other
trade has been brisk, so altogether the co.’s harvest
for three years past has been a bumper. And they
deserve it; for there had been plenty of years of
drought. Remembering that, and realising also that
booms don’t last, the wise old management has not
been sky-rocketting in the matter of dividends, but
has been putting a nice dry bit by against the
weary time of the reaction. Capital is £82,804,
in £ 1 shares; assets, apart from freeholds, plant
and rolling-stock, are £20,855 of stock-in-trade, and
£96,967 of liquid assets, including value of con-
tract work done over and above the progress pay-
ments. From that, however, has to be deducted
£18,352 on account of liabilities. Net, the liquid
and semi-liquid assets represented £1 2s. per share
after providing for the current dividend. And the out-
look, for a time at least, is good. Big contracts
have been mentioned in which the co. has a hand ;
and the reputation of the works stands high enough
to command for them a favorable hearing when any
further big jobs come on for consideration.

That is no better. This co.’s offspring, the Engin-
eering Co., recently combined with its chief com-
petitor ; but the parent is still hard up against its
electrical rival, and in spite of new buildings every-
where, its gross revenue refuses to budge. Here are
the figures for recent Jan.-June half-years:—

Meantime surplus profits have been going into the
business, but even with their help the old capital
scarcely earns what it did. Now plant 'renewals are
being called for, and, instead of being charged up
against profits as they used to be, they are being
debited to the Renewal and Contingency Fund. The
effect, of course, is to make the profits look rather
better than they otherwise would. Altogether, neither
the position nor the outlook is very cheerful. Before
paying the current dividend liquid assets (including
book debts) amounted to £9277, and there were
sundry creditors for £2192.

The big changes shown in the last few lines are due
to the Gas Act passed last year. Some of the pro-
visions of that Act came into force on January 1;
the others on July 1. Cos. had to capitalise their
reserves before the latter date if they were going
to do it at all; and, of course, they did it. Alto-
gether holders got £145,687 of bonus additions to
their capital in this way. Things have been fixed
up like this: As at June, 1912, there were 180,000
shares paid to £1 each and 30,000 of £1 paid to
10s. Then the other 10s. on the latter shares was
called up, and 105,000 new shares were issued.
Towards the cost of these 105,000 shares a bonus „#
is. 6d. was paid on the old 210,000 shares and oil
per share on the new 105,000. This represented thL
£82,687 specified above. That made 315,000 share!
Then during last half-year another £63,000 w«
divided in bonus shares—one in five. That
378,000 shares. This lot is now known as “ $
shares, and under the Gas Act are entitled to 1
much as 10 p.c. when gas is sold at 3s. 6d Alwf
it was lately decided to issue 151,200 new or “R”
shares ; but of these only 147,923 have been allotted
and paid to 2s. 6d. These shares will be entitled
to only 7 p.c. For the present, the old (“A”) shared
as well as the new (“B”) get a dividend at that
rate. But since £145,687 of the total of £378 000
of “A” capital consists of reserves lately transferred
to capital, the 7 p.c. is really a div. slightly in
excess of 11 p.c. However, the law, if it does what
it set out to do, will stop any further capitalisation
of reserves. In fact, it will stop anv further laree
accumulation of reserves. The intention of Parlia-
ment is plainly to permit a maximum div. of io
p.c. on old and of 7 p.c. on new capital if it be
ordinary, and 5 p.c. if it be pref., and, after small
and fixed provision for renewal reserves is made
to give the consumers the benefit of any excess pro-
fits through a reduction of the price of gas. Onlv
through such a reduction below 3s. 6d. can the
shareholders get more than the dividends mentioned
above. This co. is in the midst of a large pro-
gramme of works-expansion, which will, no doubt
necessitate calls on the partly paid shares. On
June 30 the liquid assets, apart from coal and resi-
dues in stock, were only £24,522, and the lia-
bilities were £16,941.

When this co. arises every six months and rattles its
bones it must make other gas cos. threatened with
electric competition feel very anxious. For this co.
is right up against a municipal electric concern that
isn’t out after dividends, and the table shows the
result. This co.’s municipal competitor is in the
extra-fortunate position of having the River Esk
close handy to supply cheap power. Further than
that, shareholders in the co. can’t have their bite till
interest has been paid on £35,425 of debentures.
And there doesn’t seem much hope that shareholders
will shake off either their burden or their competi-
tor. The debenture debt is even bigger than it was
10 years ago ; and buying out its competitor is out
of the question. Further, though gas sales for the
six months to June, 1903, were £5543, while for
the past half-year they were £6143, both wages and
materials are so much dearer that profits are much
reduced; and it -looks as though shareholders will
have to be content with the little they are getting
—or less.
Re Fairfax and Roberts. Ltd. (B.
21/8/’l3). The co.’s lease of its Sydney premises runs
another 30 years, and from buildings erected thereon
by the old firm at a cost of over £lO,OOO net rentals
of £2OOO a year are derived. The lease, though an
intangible asset, therefore has a considerable value
to the co. But as this, like every lease, is a wasting
asset, an amortization fund is being built up out
of profits. An adequate instalment of £330. is paid
into this fund per annum; nevertheless, from other
revenue, not taken into account in Profit and Loss,
special contributions are made from time to time.
As was made clear last week, the assets equalling

Profits in that table are shown gross—that is, with-
out any visible allowance for depreciation. No
fixed amount is written off by the co. to arrive at
its net profits. For last half-year, for instance, only
£7845 is deducted; in the corresponding half of
1912, £16,833. The co. is no longer a producer
of silver and lead from its own ores only. It has
three principal sources of revenue—(l) it treats
its own ores for silver and lead.; (2) it smelts other
people’s ore and silver-lead concentrates; and (3)
it makes a zinc concentrate out of its own “tail-
ings,” and either exports or smelts the product.
Soon there will be a fourth branch, for contracts
have been let for the principal part of the machinery
required in connection with the new iron and steel
works at Newcastle.
The profits are very poor compared with what
they used to be; they are poorer also than one
would expect in view of the recent high prices of
metals. Certainly in the past half-year £12,594,
the cost of the new issue of so far unproductive
capital raised for the iron and steel business, has
had to be met; but that isn’t much, comparatively
speaking. Six months ago the directors made a
confession that since the zinc business started in
1904 they had averaged a profit of Bs. per ton of
“tailings,” and for the past two years over 14s.
per ton. Last half-year the zinc concentration plant
treated 167,827 tons, and at 10s. a ton this would
mean £83,913 profit. And there is no reason to
expect that the profit would be less than 10s.,
because, though spelter has had a bad fall lately,
the co. averaged £25 4s. 9d. for last half-year, or
only £1 2s. sd. less than for the preceding term.
If £83,913 was netted from the zinc processes, it
would leave only £48,124 to come from the treat-
ment of the co.’s own and the purchased ores. The
output of the co.’s own ore was 120,568 tons, of
which 116,020 tons went to the lead mill, which
gave a product of 24,074 tons of concentrates.
Another 3289 tons of lead concentrates were ex-
tracted from the tailings. Total lead concentrates
from the co.’s own ores, 27,363 tons. The total
quantity of concentrates and slimes sent to the
co.’s smelters was 83,190 tons. The proportion of
slimes would not be large, so between 40,000 and
50,000 tons of purchased concentrates must have
been smelted. A profit of under £50,000 from
120,568 tons of the co.’s own ore and from the
handling of 40,000-odd tons of other people’s con-
centrates looks extraordinarily modest. In the co.’s
own concentrates there would be an extractable
15.000 tons of lead. For the half-year the net price
obtained for lead was £l6 2s. 3d., the second highest
for any half-year since 1907. The average netted
in 1910 was about £ll 16s. 6d. There must have
been a heavy loss on the treatment of the co.’s ore

A great mistake, when erecting new works or re-
arranging old ones, is often made in constructing the
building and installing machinery ere looking round
for means of transport of the raw material, half-
manufactured and finished goods. Messrs. Adolf
Bleichert and Co., of London, have issued various
catalogues and leaflets, illustrating and describing a
few of the many transport systems and plants which
they have supplied, and which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-
ploying such appliances. W. and J. Lempriere,

tives, and would be pleased to hear from those in-
terested. A specially trained engineer is retained to

had the 1910 prices—or, for that matter, the 1908,
or 1909, or 1911 prices—ruled last half-year. Either
that or the ore-buying business must have been
very unprofitable; and there is no reason for believ-
ing that it was.
As to the variations in the markets, here are the
average prices for the past seven terms:—
Lead, Silver, Spelter,
per ton. per oz. per ton.
May, 1910.. £l3 2s. Od. 2s. O.lfid. 1 „„„ 0
vov 1910.. 12 15s. lOd. 2s. 0.99 d. / Os - Od -

May,’ 1913.. 17 ss. 9d. 2s. 4.09 d. 24 11s. 4d.
But the co. made a rather better average for zinc
(spelter) than £24 11s. 4d. last half-year; it got
£25 4s. 9d. This paper will not attempt to fore-
cast what the co. will get in future. On
the one hand, there is no apparent reason
why these metals should not • share in the
general increase of prices. Probably that
general increase is due to the vast increase in
the world’s stock of gold; anyhow, whatever the
cause, there it is—an average of about 26 p.c., so
far as can be made out, since 1900. Other things
being equal, there should not then be a recurrence
to the low-price levels of 1894 and thereabouts. (In
1894 lead was as low as £9 and copper £3B; and
in 1895 spelter sold down to £l4 155.) On the
other hand, it seems impossible that the continued
big output of spelter from Broken Hill can avoid
weakening that market. Practically this is a brand-
new source of supply, which began to be heard
from only 10 years ago. A new supplier can't throw
230,000 tons a year on to a market which hadn’t
been in the habit of taking more than 500,000 tons
altogether without seriously disturbing it, unless
new demands arise. And there is nothing notable
reported in the way of a new demand.
As to the old B. H. Prop, mine—well, you can’t
eat your cake and have it too. This co. ate its
cake voraciously for 26 years (it is now
28 years old) ; and though there may be 1,900,000
tons of ore left within the pay limit, efforts to
find more are dismal failures. General-manager
Delprat certainly reports that the drill lately pierced
a 25ft. body of fair grade at the 1500 ft. level. But
turn up the sections published with the report, and
you will see that this ore is right at the Block 10
end of the mine, where the body is fast dipping out
of the B. H. Prop, property. At the other end, no
ore can be found below 400 ft. At the present rate
of extraction there is enough ore proved to last
eight years. To that, three or four years more may
possibly be added by the workings on the bottom
of the shoot. Of tailings to keep the zinc mill
going there are about 1,100,000 tons in the dumps.
These will be used up inside five years, going as at
present. Generally speaking, then, it can be said
that, if work were continued as at present, 10 years
would see the B. H. Prop, at or very near its end
as a big mining proposition. After that, it must be
an industrial concern, depending on its smelting
plant and its iron and steel works. And the likely
profits from these no man knows. No man has even
a nodding acquaintance with them.

Broken Hill South made £119,836 last
half-year. That looks like the turn of Broken Hill’s
tide. The previous half-year profits ran up to
£217,776. Over £40,000 less than was made was
divided in that half; over £40,000 more in the
past half. Causes of the shrinkage: (1) Costs
sprang from 19s. 3d. to 225. per ton; (2) the
stupid Silverton Tram strike, over whether half-a-
dozen pannikin bosses should join the clerks’ union,
hung up work for from a fortnight to three weeks;
(3) lead averaged £l7 10s. Bd. against £l9 6s. 3d.,
silver 2s. 5Jd. against 2s. 7£d.,and zinc £24 11s. 2d.
against £26 Bs. 7d. The co. produced 17,141
tons of lead (in concentrates) in the half-year, prac-
tically all recoverable; and a fall of £1 15s. 7d.
for lead means an almost exact £30,000. No doubt
the profits for the previous half-year were inflated.
The co. not only got a big price for current pro-
duction, but was also paid surpluses on stuff pre-
viously marketed and not finally settled for. This
current half-year, in consequence of the bad fall in
zinc, it may have to pay back some money over-
drawn on account of last half-year’s shipments. In
case there should be a heavy draft on this account
there is a special suspense account ( £35,000) to
fall back on.

From a man on the works: “I don’t give
the Broken Hill Water Co. freedom from competi-
tion for as long as the two years mentioned in B.
14/8/’l3. The work at Umberumberka is not dawd-
ling; the dam is nearly finished, the pipe line is
being laid, and if pumping is not started by Feb.,
1914, I will drink nothing but castor oil till it is.
After that, whether the mines will then draw their
supplies from the co. or the State scheme depends,
I expect, on which offers the liquid for the less
money.” The man who prophesies positively when
pumping will start at Broken Hill is rash. The co.’s
reservoir was finished nearly two years before there
was enough water in it to pump.

Glamorgan Copper Options Syndicate pro-
poses to resolve itself into a co. of £30,000 in £1
shares. This is a show in the Grafton district
(N.S.W.), and a lot of puff has been heard about
it from time to time. But, for some reason, there
seems to have been a disinclination to find out what
is .below the water-level; the development has been
confined to shallow shafts and short tunnels, which
testified in places to some fair bunches of ore. A
favorable report is issued by the late manager of
the Pulganbar Copper and Quicksilver Mines, whose
history provides unpleasant memories. The Glam-
organ now talks about a treatment plant, like the
Pulganbar did; and until it gets one it won’t be
happy. Whether it will be happy then is another
question. The Pulganbar wasn’t.
This Grafton district comes into some prominence
in an interesting and useful memoir just published
by J. E. Carne, assistant Government Geologist of
N.S.W. The report deals with the occurrence of
mercury in this State, as well as in other countries.
Pulganbar’s disastrous plant for retorting the
alleged bulk of mercury ore at the mine didn’t
arouse much enthusiasm. “The rich ore it treated at
the start, containing about 50 p.c. of mercury, is
no criterion of what can be achieved with the aver-
age ore, yielding probably 1 to 2 p.c., or less.”
Later history proves that it certainly wasn t a
criterion. Nevertheless, provided the mine is not a
mere packet of pills, 1 to 2 p.c. mercury ore ought
to be good enough. But the business wants to be
in the hands of some highly-competent person with
special training for this class of work.
\\ hen Scantlebury’s Ardlethan Options
Syndicate was floated the idea was that the boom
would last long enough to allow of option blocks
being floated off at a fine profit. But the boom
dropped dead, and now, with the options on the
point of expiry, something has to be done to save
the money which the syndicate has spent, for the
hasn’t the money to exercise the options
itself. The result is the prospectus of the Ardlethan
Proprietary, Ltd. The proposed co. is in 72,000
shares of £lO each; the Options Syndicate and a
couple of smaller concerns throw in their assets,
and, so far as the Options Syndicate is concerned,
takes one ordinary share for every old share.
(Ihere are 3000 shares in the Options Syndicate.)
3600 10 p.c. non-cumulative pref. shares are
offered to the public, and the money thus raised—-
it it is raised—will be reserved for the exercise of
options. If no option is exercised the money will
be returned. It is a fair enough proposition in the
game of back up or forfeit. Certainly no engineers’
reports are printed to show that it wouldn’t be
better to forfeit, and cut up the £lO,OOO or there-
abouts which it seems is left.
Block 14 Torrington (N.S.W.) has got
its plant going and reports 27251 b. concentrates
from 167 tons crudes; average 16.31 b. wolfram.
The value doesn’t exceed 16s. unless the concen-
trates contain something of greater value than
wolfram. Possibly they do, for in the Sydney Geo-
logical Museum there are some fine specimens of
Torrington’s metallic bismuth. One shows a streak
of bismuth running across wolfram. There are
127,000 ordinary and 23,000 10 p.c. preference
shares in the co., and 10 stampers will have all
their work cut out to provide dividends for this lot
from ore worth only shillings per ton.

Another man who has done good work in
Australian tin and copper left this week for the
other end of the earth to see what’s doing there.
This is J. W. Tilley, formerly manager of Vegetable
Creek tin and Grafton copper. His eye is cast with
most longing on the old Cornish dumps and alluvial
propositions. It seems amazing, considering that
Cornwall has been working tin and copper since
Phoenician times, but it is a fact, nevertheless, that
many of those who are dredging and sluicing the old
dumps and alluviums are Australian-trained men.
In fact, Hunter, who used to manage Bourke’s Hill
(N.S.W.), not only went himself, but took 22 men
with him ; and at least two dredges have been built
in Australia to follow them.

Some Kalgoorlie people have pegged the
old Rothesay mine at Yalgoo (W.A.). In the
’9o’s this show was acquired by an English co.,
which sent out a manager with a silk hat and a
staff. A lot of expensive machinery, plant and
buildings were erected under kid-gloved supervision,
and an enormous sum was spent in equipment and
development. A few crushings, including one which
averaged an ounce, were taken out, and then the
silk-hatted boss and his suite left. The ore contains
much copper, and probably this had something to
do with their departure. “Those who know the
mine best,” says the local paper, “consider that some
day it will be a big producer.” But will it ever pay?
The Bulletin knows a mine which experts
said had tons of gold in sight. So it had;
but it also had arsenic, antimony, and other objec-
tionable ingredients, and the cost of getting the
bullion was considerably greater than its worth.
The end was debt.
* •* * *
Fate of Associated Northern’s Victorious
leases (W.A.) is now in the balance. With practi-
cally no rich stuff left for sweetening, with the 1
and 2 levels closed by creep, and with only the 3
and 4 levels available for mill supplies, the output
must necessarily be restricted for the next few
months. The future of the mine depends on what
is exposed at the No. 5 level. So far 110 ft. of
driving has been done at this point, and the last
25ft. has averaged £4 ss. The best stuff- —if it is
there at all—is ahead, but if further development
prove that it isn’t there the show won’t be worth
much.

8., M. and Co, report that recent develop-
ments at the 17th, 18th and 19th levels of Sons of
Gwalia (W.A.) have been satisfactory. Apart from
other makes of ore previously exposed, an Bft. for-
mation. assaying 485., has been bored through at
the No. 19, a body of ore has been driven, risen
and winzed in the south end of the No. 18, and a
high-grade shoot has been followed down 130 odd
feet in a winze below No. 17 level. The ore exposed
at the No. 18 level is believed to be the “central”
shoot, and its location is thought to be important, as
the levels immediately above appear to be clean out
of values.
* * * *
Associated (W.A.) reports a revenue of
£161.042 for the year ended March, and a remittance
of £23,000 to the London office for the same period.
The year’s gross profit was £40,428, which with
£863 brought forward made a total credit of
41,291. From this £19,378 has been written off
for development and £4653 for plant, leaving a
balance of £17,258. A sixpenny dividend, absorbing
£12,384, reduced this amount to £4874, which has
been carried forward. Liquid assets (apart from
plant, stores and cash in hind) consist of Transvaal
3 per cent, guaranteed stock and Consols, and repre-
sent a total value of over £126,000. The quantity
of broken ore in the stopes is estimated at 43,199
tons, representing a cost of £8606. The co. has,
in conjunction with the Huronian Belt Syndicate,
acquired an ootion on the Keeley mine at South
Lorrain, Ontario, a short distance from Cobalt.
Operations have been started, and reports to date
are said to be satisfactory.
Among other things told shareholders at
the Boulder meeting in London was that the Board
had its eye on two shows outside the Kalgoorlie
field. It now transpires that one of these is a gold
mine on the Cleveland Peninsula, in south-eastern
Alaska. A certain amount of cash has been set
aside to develop this property, and a manager is
being sent from London. Nothing worth relating
has occurred lately in the Boulder mine, except that
the “3oz. ore” pierced by the drill at 500 ft. has, on
driving, proved to be worth only a few dwt.
Mountain Queen (W.A.) is approaching
a critical stage. The supplies of payable ore m the
oxidised zone are being rapidly depleted, and the
metallurgical staff is hurriedly experimenting with
a view of finding out the best means of treating the
sulphides. In some respects the latter resemble
those in the co.’s Transvaal lease. The percentage
of arsenic is considerable. No difficulty is anticipated
in getting hold of a process to successfully deal with
the ore, but —costs ?
* * * *
When the last mail left Westralia the
intersection of Commodore’s main shoot at 400 ft. was
hourly Gxppctcd. Good results <ire snticipsted froyn
this development; consequently, almost everybody in
the vicinity is loaded up with scrip. A revenue of
£7089 or £825 less than the previous six months,
was derived from ore treatment during the half-year
ended Mav. The falling off was due to lower grade
and shorter shoots. As receipts _ were insufficient
to cover capital outlay on shaft sinking, etc., calls
had to be made. Cash amounting to £1728 was in
hand when the half-year closed, but £793 was due
to sundry creditors.
Cassilis, Gippsland, still struggles with an
overdraft, which at the moment represents a grip of
£4266 on future profits. Against that is the hydro-
electric plant, an asset that a mine needs, but daren’t
count upon to fetch much if it once gets under the
hammer. Not that this ought to happen at the
Cassilis, for the co. has not only the main Cassilis
formation to draw on, but the Ceresa lode and three
undeveloped parallel formations. Cassilis has had
too much big-head and too little patchy ore at the
Nos. 7 and 8 levels. Now in the winze from 850 ft.
good grade ore has been sunk on from 40ft. to 80ft.,
but one can't tell yet whether it is a patch or a
shoot of decent extent. If the latter, the Ceresa ore
could be used as a sweetener once the cash was
forthcoming to open up another lift. Last six months
only £2483 came from 2471 tons, which about
paid for mine work. Manager Lilburne can’t be
proud of this, and wants development work shaken
up. Results for the last three half-years have about
killed all chance of this appeal being met in a
breezy spirit. Still, the Cassilis has a manager, three
undeveloped shallow formations to fossick, a rich,
narrow shoot in the Ceresa, and cheap power; so it
has about an even chance of winning if shareholders
aren’t too tired to shell out a few more calls over a
specific works policy.

Latterly the mists have risen off the Clarence, work
at the adjacent South Moon again bringing in the
sunshine. The South got good gold out of the spurs
above 890 ft., and Clarence is now hunting after the
continuation of the back with which these spurs
are connected. Already it has spotted a color or
two of gold. Tributors working on the old 1580 ft.
formation are also making towards the developments
deeper down at 1740 ft. south. Seeing this, the touts
are helping the old holders to unload per the usual
puff pars, and brokers’ tips; but a heap of work
has to be done to put Clarence even up to the level
of the slow dogs of the Pyke group.
Great Extended Tunnel, Walhalla, has as
assets a main tunnel and a position. Where it
shamed the rest of Walhalla was in going ahead of
the Long Tunnel, the Extended and the North to
break new ground on Cohen’s reef. For such a
gamble, with 'Walhalla dubious, it had to call in
outside capital, and this has paid for 1660 ft. of
tunnelling, with nothing better than good colors to
show for the outlay. On the lease boundary dykes
are being cut, but they don’t carry the antimonial
pyrites which mark the dyke against which Cohen’s
reef makes richer. So the co. is to grub out into the
old Consols claim, and there chase after the reef.
In the old days £lOO,OOO was spent there in shaft
sinking to 1900 ft., but only ragged formation was
got, and no power on earth ought to induce the
Extended Tunnel to climb down the ladders of that
dreadful sink. Its hope is to hit a new make north
of the shaft. A geological survey ought to help the
little co. in this quest in a much-neglected locality.

On a capital of £5400 the Wandiligong
dredges at Bright (Vic.) have paid £19,410 in
divs. ; a regular shilling a month came last half-year,
and there was £1717 net in cash on hand on June
30. But the end is near; No. 1 dredge has 18
months’ work ahead of it, No. 2 rather less than 12
months’. Then apparently it will have to be liqui-
dation, for new properties are hard to get. The
plant, though severely written down, still stands in
the books at £4651, and no doubt shareholders will
get a few shillings out of that, too.
For the first seven months of this year
the 19 principal mines at Charters Towers produced
gold worth £155,998. Brilliant Extended crushed
14,611 tons for £37,927 ; New Brilliant Freehold,
7813 tons for £19,800; Brilliant Deeps, 4638
tons for £19,700; Mills’ United, 7742 tons for
£18,397. These are the only five-figure mines.
Brilliant Stockholm crushed 3026 tons for £8562,
and prospects are improving. A big body of stone
is showing on the rise from No. 8 level, where the
Stockholm junctions with a cross reef. This Stock-
holm development helps to account for the rise in
Brilliant P.C. shares, for that ancient and heavily-
weighted concern owns the mine, and crushings from
it have enabled the co. to chase the elusive Day
Dawn reef.

Vulcan (N.Q.), whose improvement was
noted a few weeks ago, has at last got back to the
div. list with a modest threepenny ( £3300). With
a new shoot proved for 300 ft. below the 670 ft. level,
and with costs reduced, this threepenny shouldn’t be
an orphan, especially as the co.’s financial position
is easy. * * *

Lode Hill tin shares have been taken confi-
dently by Melbourne speculators, who expect good
returns when the water supply is increased. The
claim is near the Bloomfield River (N.Q.), and a
plentiful supply of water can be obtained from
Roaring Meg Creek; but the races, etc., run into
money. This work should be finished early next
year. The expected production is 30 tons per
month, if the rotten granite to be sluiced pans
out according to estimate (1.261 b. per cub. yard).
Costs are estimated at 3d. per yard.

On receipt of Alex. D. McDonald’s cold-
water report on the oil discovery at the Victoria
River (N.T.), the directors of the Victoria River
Coal and Oil Co. cast round for another show in
which to invest the few hundreds they had on hand.
So they have taken a six months’ option over an
un-get-at-able silver-gold show near Omeo (Vic.).
The purchase price is £3OOO, and £BOO is needed
to prove the mine, or 10s. a share in calls. Share-
holders not anxious to take on this liability may
hand in their scrip and get 3s. a share cash.

Commonwealth Asphaltum Co. (S.A.) has
received an encouraging report from an expert who
has prospected its oil area at Coffin Bay, t- Y re s
Peninsula. Bitumen was found by sinking, and fine
samples of petroleum and asphaltum, collected from
various parts of the area, have been examined and
identified in Adelaide. T. J. Whaley, a Californian
oil man, lately found bitumen and oil on the surface
at Airey’s Inlet, south-west of Geelong, and bitumen
west of Warrnambool, near the coast. Whaley
advises deep boring, which is, after all, the only
reliable test for petroleum. But it looks as though
the Government will have to do the work; for the
investing public remains profoundly sceptical about
the existence of oil in the southern half, at any rate,
of Australia. If the Government is driven to under-
take the prospecting, it ought to be made plain that
Private Enterprise will have to keep out of the busi-
ness for all time.

E A Weinberg was heard of last from
London, whither he sped to pilot the Hercules-
Primrose-Zeehan smelter deal. He wants to raise
£7O 000 which takes a lot of doing in London just
now ’ Somewhere in the foreground Bowes Kelly is
triving Weinberg a shove-on, for this Primrose is a
bit more than a casual vegetable to the big man.
Why not complete the job by helping Senator
Clemons out of the ditch over the Tasmanian Copper
Co.’s bi-sulphite agreement, and swing that concern
into the amalgamation ? No one would mind the
German element being let into the deal, for Austra-
lian control would be assured. The inference from
Blakemore’s report was that something more solid
than the Hercules and Primrose is needed to feed
the new smelter fledgling until the problem of treat-
ment is solved. Morse's report only said that the
threshold had been reached in regard to processes for
the Rosebery mines.

The Commonwealth Government has en-
gaged Dr. Arthur Wade, a British authority on
petroleum mining, to inspect the oil bores at the
Vailala River, Papua, 130 miles north-west from Port
Moresby. Dr. Wade will reach Papua in October,
direct from London. The Government bore is down
to 260 ft., and has touched petroleum, but not
in oil sands. It is obvious that the petroleum has
escaped to this point from below, through a fracture
or fault in the covering rocks, and the oil reser-
voir itself may be some distance away. Wade's
most important job will be to decide where other
bores should be put down.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, August 25, 1913.
My Dear Arini, —
The recently-arrived scientists from the
Carnegie Institute (Washington, U.S.A.)
are going north to Torres Strait and ad-
jacent waters. The most boyish-looking
member of the party is F. M. Potts, of
Cambridge Uni. (England). He might
easily pass in a crowd as that oft-quoted
myth, Macaulay’s “Every schoolboy.”
(There are five myths by the way: “Every
schoolboy,” “the intelligent foreigner,”
“the average person,” “the free and en-
lightened elector,” and “the bald-headed
man at the back of the omnibus.”) The
learned Potts was summed up by a fellow
passenger as “the smallest frame that
he had ever known to contain so much
knowledge.” As far as one can gather, the
Carnegie Institute hopes to slake its thirst
for chemical research in the tropics by
studying the silvery flash of phosphorescence
in shark-haunted seas, and peering into the
emotions of a jellyfish. It will also inquire
into the domestic habits of the tiny builders
of coral heaps, and dissect the life story of
a worm. The hunting of the snark is not
included in its itinerary, though someone
ought to have another look at that animal —
likewise the boojurn and the kraken. Has
anybody got a dried kraken in his collec-
tion?
J. Bull. M.P., and his relations will have
to show their vaccination marks before the
State consents to be deprived of the pleas-
ure of their company. The petticoats of the
party have been bidden to Government
House to break the festive bun with Lady
Edeline, on _ the afternoon they scramble
ashore in this town, which will be Septem-
ber 2.
The Chamber of Manufactures has ear-
marked and branded September 11 as the
date of its annual dinner, and if anybody
steals that date and is found with the goods
in his possession he will be pursued with
the uttermost fury of the law. A dark de-
sign t 9 impound the Parliamentary Bullites
for this spread is connected with the 11th
of next month. This is the only possible
day on which the British M.P. is likely to
have an hour or two to give away
after the return flight from Brisbane.
By that time his inner Bull may be
unable to bear the strain of too much extra
food. For he will have been bumped by
motor over some of the deepest holes in our
less expensive country lanes, and his experi-
ences may recall that picture of the first
hansom cab, which was built of saplings,
and had segments of big trees for wheels, and
a bear in the shafts, and a hairy driver who
drove with an axe, and hustled 'the bear and
the cab over a road that was all boulders,
and the hairy passenger—it being a time
of iron currency—paid his fare with a dis-
used stove.
The Horticultural Farran sisters are on
the land in a small, brisk way in the Moss
V ale district. They are going to run a
model garden in the Town Hall basement
during the Girls’ Exhibition. The soil being
of cement a few barrow-loads of mother
earth will be added to coax the young seed-
lings to put on sturdy, green top skirts.
A worker in the Cause—-1 got on her
track after a hand-to-hand combat with the
phone, and it was a great battle, and a
glorious victory, as old Casper (if it was
Casper) said to Peterkin (if it was Peter-
kin ) about Blenheim or Trafalgar or
Actium, or some other vanished disturbance,
and the floor was littered with dead re-
marks,. and there was much struggle and
confusion, and the telephone department
was as unmanageable as a Bulgarian army.
However, .to take breath and resume, the
worker said that £4Ol and some shillings is
the size of the Hospice Ball cheque.
The Women Painters’ show is still mean-
dering along in Lawson House, Clarence-
street. _ A steady procession of triumphal

zon that tea will be brewed on the

Fencing is one of this city’s most ardent
crazes at the present moment. The slim
silhouette (the original Silhouette was a
French Minister of Finance, and 'he cut ex-
penses down to a shadow, so people named
these shadow pictures after him) who
glides across our most expensive enter-
tainments finds that she can only
down her hips and reduce her waistline to
vanishing point by a serious devotion to
some form of physical culture. Black tea
and rusks for breakfast, followed by an hour
with the foils, is alleged to give you an
ethereal air of being able to blow through a
keyhole. The Sydney Ladies’ Fencing Club
is the latest development of this cult of the
slender. It meets by the light of the gas
jet every Monday evening. A top floor in
Denman Chambers (Phillip-street) houses
the game and play of foils —chiefly of the
French, German and Italian schools —to the
vast advantage of our too, too solid flesh.
Mrs. Ambrose Pratt dared to cross the
border to this vaccination area. She is
spending a few weeks with her sister, Mrs.
Harry Austin, amongst the velvet lawns of
Darling Point. Mrs. Ambrose is one of the
handsome daughters of a former Traffic
Manager named Roberts, whose business it
was to train up young trams in the way
they should buzz. Ambrose,, as you know,
is a versatile writer of much fact and fiction.
In his work-a-day moods he tosses off leaders
for the Melbourne Age.
A moderately-truthful rumor says in a
hoarse undertone that Mr. David Anderson’s
health is by no means A 1 at Lloyd’s just
now. He is the Orient Co.’s chief at the
Australian end of the big steamers’ wharf-
age. Just now he is taking care of a help-
ing of out-of-sorts health (assisted by his
wife and two daughters), at a house on “the
river” —which in England means the Thames
every time.
Immigration-officer Percy Hunter bumped
gently against Suva one day last week. This
irrepressible study of perpetual motion is
aboard the Makura, which also shelters J.
Bull, M.P., and his female relatives.
Norwegian Consul Fay (Melb.) and Aus-
trian Tourist Malclier, have recently beaten
Father Time in their flight from the hostel
to the frosty pate of Kosciusko. This is a
snow-shod distance of about 36 miles, there
and_ back, inclusive. The usual tripper
dallies at Betts’ Camp to warm his toes and
pull the blankets up over his ears o’ nights.
This gives him a prodigious snail-like ad-
venture of from 2i to three days, all the
way and back again. The Fay-Malcher
duet crept out of their mountain tavern at
7 a.m. while morning tea was knocking at
the frozen bedroom door. They thawed the
door and escaped; fled on snow-shoes to the
top of Kosciusko, sat down on the warmest
icicle they could find, to admire the scenery
and munch a drink or two, and strolled
into the hostel about 5 p.m. the same after-
noon. A Monaro man with a penguin in
his beard says that this was a great feat
of speed and endurance. The snow was
deeper while the record-breakers were
ploughing through it than it has been for
years. There wasn’t enough landscape un-
buried to show the difference between a tree
and a tea leaf.
Mr. and Mrs. Bonas, who are Parra-
matta folks, are conspiring together con-
cerning a trip to Ceylon.
One of this Babylonian hamlet’s best-
known commercial men, T. IJ. Stephen,
who is a Colonial Paper Co. mag-
nate, threatens to whisk himself off
to _ the cinnamon groves of Colombo
(this is some more Ceylon 1 for a snack of
sight-seeing. He is a good Australian who
was born in Aberdeen. I know of five Aber-
deens, including a place built mostly of bam-
boo and leaves, and much infested by fish,
fowls, dogs, colored folk and pigs, in Hong-
kong. But Mr. Stephen comes from the
genuine place—the cold granite city in the
north of Scotland.
In spite of the generally cloudy or over-
cast conditions of the tourists’ sky just
now —in consequence of the lymph epoch—
a few enterprising people may still be seen
moving on the horizon. I observe, through
field glasses, the preliminary preparations
of the W. 1. A. Larcombe family at North
Sydney. W. F. has already begun to talk
to his maternal parent and a sister about
the size of cabin trunks and other necessary
nuisances connected with travel. They are
off to Ceylon (this is the third time that
island has turned up within the last five
minutes) before the end of the year. The
habit of going to Ceylon is growing. It is
a country surrounded by blue seas, and
arched over by blue skies; and the soil is
mostly red, and the foliage is an intense
green, and the native is an intense brown
outside and an intense fraud inside, and an
intense beggar at all times. So the ancient
isle of Taprobane is a rest to the brain and
the eye.
The Alice Currie Tent City scheme is
still dangling in the air. It may settle down
on a strip of suitable Crown land at Deewhy
before the summer bakes the Western
plains. Minister Trefle is friendly to the
notion of giving the Great Experiment a
trial on a leasehold grip of the earth down
Narrabeen way. The committee is composed
ot incurable optimists who aim at bringing
some of the women and children of the Out-
back to. the seaside, before January 1, 1914,
flames in the eastern skv. It waits with
some impatience, for the Ministerial “Yea.”
Vaccination still rages in the Town Hall
basement with . mild ferocity. Town Clerk
Nesbitt is officially responsible for the hot
coiiee that supports the Nightingales in at-
tendance on the innumerable arms and legs
of the multitude. And the Nightingales
greet his nicely-parted hair and interest in
their well-being with a purr of welcome over
the starch of their immaculate collars.
A London correspondent sends a codicil
to her inky remarks of last week, re the
nobility and gentry who come this way in
Lady Denman’s train. She says: “Instead
of the more middle-aged lion. Cecilia, etc.,
her young half-sister, Alicia Knatchbuli-
Hugessen, is going to Australia with G.-G.
Denman’s lady. She is about 21 or 22,
and means to have a good time in your sun-
kissed settlement. Her name is rather un-
handy, but she’ll probably smuggle it
through the Customs, duty free.”
Artist Thea Proctor is meditating a
descent from her Sydney eyrie, which is
skied at the top of six flights of stairs. She
is climbing down from this giddy height in
order to take her wares to Melbourne. There
she’ll show them in a Centre Way gallery
(Collins-street), and September 16 will be
the opening day. Thea Proctor, unlike
many women artists, knows how to blend
colors in her own apparel, and she perches
a saucy hat on her dark locks at the most
acute angle the fashionable brim will stand.
The Sydney girl studied for a time in
George Lambert’s London studio. She has
caught many of his masterful ways with a
brush. Her fan-painting throbs with the
joy of life. When she depicts the ballet
dancer twirling on one toe, or flings her
colors on to the figures in a French bal
masqu6, the only thing you miss is the
orchestra.
St. Vincent’s Hospital Ball will, barring
some overwhelming catastrophe, have made
its presence felt in the Town Hall, before
this meets your eye, Arini. Aide Talbot is
to Watteau in Mrs. Ronald Forbes’ fancy
set instead of Forbes, A.D.C. It was a toss
up as to which Help should be on the offi-
cial chain, as Governor Strickland’s presence
was arranged for. So committee dames
named them both, for luck, in the first crisis
of the affair.
Mrs. Reginald Davies gave as her little
whack to St. Vincent’s Hospital Ball, the
rent of the Town Hall for the occasion. This
runs into £25 or thereabouts.
Manager Dunbar Poole devised the recent
dressy Glaciarium carnival as a glacial re-
suscitation of the Last Days of Pompeii.
Vesuvius was amongst the fatalities and
accidents not present. The cry for “Light,
More Light!” might well have shaken the
skating forum while the chariots rumbled in
the entrance to the ice patch. The Queen
of Sheba (Mrs. Scharff) was observed to
drive on attended by a large background of
peacock’s feathers. Butterflies (Mr. W.
Muir in charge) flapped their velvet wings
in the twilight of the first slither in the
grand procession. “Gold,” a good-looking
team that snatched a prize, was arranged
by Miss L. Wallis. Most of the ladies in
this set _ had sturdy understandings and"
short skirts. Mrs. Archibald mothered a
hunting team. A coterie labelled “Jewels”
might just as well have called itself
“Marbles” or “Hockey. Its gems were too
small a glitter to convey any meaning to
the casual spectator. Miss Hobroyde’s team,
“Indian Chief and Squaws,” was one of the
most satisfactory because it could be placed
without the programme. “The Stone Age”
was arranged by C. Rea, It was warmly
clad in somebody’s best fur mats.
McCausland, M.A., M.D., etc., the huge
and genial Irishman (he is as big as the
whole anti-Home Rule movement of Belfast
and Derry) who is official healer on the
Orsova, trips back to London in that craft,
but does the deed with reluctance. He
hopes to come this way again, and the sign
and shingle and stethoscope of McCausland
may yet hang out in these parts. The
haunting beauty of the harbor and the outer
sea and the sky have got him down. His
ear has been bitten by our sunsets. The
grey canopy of smoke that hangs over
Botany or Footscray, or some such old
place has pulled his leg. The long wash of
Australasian seas has made music in his
soul The eucalyptus-scented breeze has
gently disturbed his back hair. So he is a
big, glad Irishman, and wants to return.
onal * Mcßeath, who is going tQ be the
fiddler of the John McCormack season, is a
Sydney youth. He won a scholarship that
gave him three years’ tuition at Melbourne
Conservatorium. Donald shows the promise
of a bright career in his precocious ability
and confident technique. Despite his name
he doesn’t play the bagpipes.
Tenor John McCormack will greet the lis-
tening ear in this town on September 4
John, I understand, has chased the New
York dollar with enormous success during
his recent warble in that congested village.
The New York Hippodrome, which holds
7000 persons, was unable to squeeze in
another pair of boots during the Irish tenor’s
recent appearance there. Several thousand
persons were also accommodated with fresh
air outside the building on the same occa-
sion. The huge city owns, amongst other
curiosities, an Amateur Musical Society,
consisting of 1500 women. This is mainiv

Nordica was a plump island of white
satin, entirely surrounded by diamonds nf
the first water, on Saturday evening Her
platform manner is a happy combination of
art, mixed up with the careless promenade
style of a youngster strolling home from
school. She examines the scenery (as sun
plied by manager Freddie Shipman) and
plucks an occasional leaf from the foliage
that leans up against a green lattice, then
she opens her mouth in song. Nordica’s art
being planted in dramatic movement she
sings few things better at the present’ time
than the “Erl King” and Brunnhilde’s
“Battle Cry.” Dufault, in Handel’s
“Where’er You Walk” and Massenet’s
“Pens6e d’Automne,” with, later, a spirited
attack on “Invictus,” made the rafters ring
with his silvery top notes. Holding, behind
the fiddle, showed the local student how to
handle the twirligigs of the familiar “Rondo
Cappriccioso” with a technique that sent an
uproar of applause tearing through the
municipal barn. Romayne Simmons, most
delightful of accompanists, fled through por-
tion of the floral scenery when Nordica tried
to drag him forward to make his bow to
the company. He slipped through her
fingers like a buttered eel into some secret
hiding-place behind the draught that howls
under the organ pipes.
Franklin Holding, the brilliant fiddler with
the Nordica concert co., is usually recalled
three or four times before he can escape to
the artists’ den under the Town Hall organ
steps. Holding is a serious looking young
man with a large, informative brow and a
soul full of music. He gets the music from
his mother’s side of the house, and his
prayerful expression from his father’s family.
This has Stowe in its escutcheon, and is re-
lated to Henry Beecher Stowe of that ilk,
and Harriet of the same family who invented
“Uncle Tom,” though she had hardly ever
seen a nigger in her life. Also she devised
Little Eva, who was in a sense the cause
of Little Willie. Holding has fought with
both hands for every advantage he has had
in the way of tuition. He earned the money
to pay the fees of such masters as Sevcik
in Prague, Witek in Berlin, and Charles
Loeffler in Boston, in the sweat of his stu-
pendous forehead. He finished training
last September. This is his first concert
tour, and he has achieved a mildly sensa-
tional appearance in this city on a 1760
fiddle valued at £2OOO.
The elegant Waller turned his name back
to front for stage use. He is Waller Lewis
on the domestic hearth. Like the Brough
menage of years ago, the English Lewis
family is devoted to its own relatives.
There was some notion of bringing a fine,
upstanding old mother of some 84 summers
on the Australian tour, but she clung to her
cap-basket, and spectacles and stayed at
home. So there are, on this side, only a
brunette daughter of Henry V. Waller, a
son who wears a fashionably-bored expres-
sion and a neat black moustache, and a
tall brother, Victor Lewis. He bears a
strong family likeness to the matinee idol
in the elegance of his waist-line, and the
attractive salaam which he distributes
gratis to ladies. Mrs. V. Lewis and a
young son also travel round with the Battle
of Agincourt and the stage crown jewels.
t Mabel Tagliaferro, the American pocket
Venus who w T as out here in drama some
years ago, has just made a second plunge
into matrimony. According to Uncle Sam's
press cuttings Mabel and her first husband.
Frederic Thompson, agreed to a trial separa-
tion of one year. The separation, as one
writer tactfully remarks, was then “made
permanent.” Sweet are the uses of adver-
tisement. Headlines pick out the fact that
the pretty little vaudeville star said “I will”
to picture-play actor Tom Carrigan in a
Michigan field of daisies, while a justice of
the peace took the names and ages (26
years apiece) of bride and groom. Then
the press wures began to talk, and the wed-
ding “leaked out” on a large scale, just as
the Amazon leaks into the Atlantic sea.
H. N. Southwell, who has been in charge
of Paling’s concert business for many
strenuous years, is now ashore on the dreary
coast of Sick Bay. At present he is located
in the Carrington Hospital, Camden. His
innumerable friends are chasing him with
sympathy per medium of the penny post.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

Have you ever reckoned the number of miles you travel

pleasure ? And —
Have you figured out how much it costs you in twelve
months ?
Perhaps you may live within easy access of the town —easy by reason of
its many conveniences of transit —but this may mean anything from one
to five miles out, and even more; five miles from your daily duties, five
miles to be covered morning and evening, 3000 odd miles a year, and
this is but one item of travel.
Are you doing this travelling to the best advantage to yourself?
Are you getting pleasure from it? Are you getting health from it? Or
are you dependent on time-table methods of locomotion, with all its objec-
tionable restrictions?
The purchase of a Motor Cycle places at your disposal the cheapest form
of locomotion, and with this economy a great saving in time, an exercise
and recreation that will bring health and vigor to the body, and clear-
ness to the brain.
Moreover, this practice of economy brings with it leisure hours to be
spent on the open roads, the companionship of the countryside is yours
to be enjoyed, and the daily jaunts to business become a pleasure, instead
of a necessary evil.
Do not let the choice of a suitable machine worry you—get the “No
Worry” machine, the machine for economy, for hard service, for comfort,
for absolute reliability, get the Triumph Motor Cycle, and it will satisfy.

THE CALLING VOICE,
With Eight Illustrations by Lionel Lindsay.
A Story of the Australian Bush.
By E. F. CHRISTIE.
PRICE, 1/-; POST FREE, 1/1.
The power of the calling voice of the Bush is splendidly illustrated in this book, where a young
farmer marries a city girl and takes her to live outback; but, although he provides her with every-
thing she can wish, her desire for “society” induces him to try residence in the Big Smoke. An
endless round of hollow pleasures soon satiates them, however, and the call of the Bush becomes so
insistent that they succumb, and finally find happiness in the country.
This book is full of humor, and some of the society people introduced are worth their weight in
gold to our readers. Indeed, their antics in the country turn the laugh against the town so completely
that, for once, the rustic scores. The illustrations are excellent.
THEATRICAL CARICATURES, by HARRY JULIUS.
With Original Anecdotes by CLAUDE McKAY.
A most novel and amusing publication dealing with the theatre in Australia. Open the book
anywhere and you are sure of a laugh. Over 200 illustrations of popular players. Pages of amusing
anecdotes.
BINDAWALLA, by THOS. E. SPENCER.
The author himself reckoned this the best book ever he wrote. A stirring story full of dramatic
incidents, and the genial good humour of which the creator of “Mrs. McSweeney” was master.
BASE BRANDS, by H. M. SOMER.
A splendid account of the ways of sheep-stealers and cattle-duffers in the early days, recounted by
one whose merits as a story-teller are well known. The double life of the principal character reminds
one of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
CHANDLER OF CORRALINCA,
by R. J. CASSIDY.
The tale of an outback ne’er-do-well, who, for the love of the squatter’s daughter, determines to
turn over a new leaf. He takes what he calls “a sporting chance” and puts up a good fight. A
very unusual book, well worth reading.
“INVALID & CONVALESCENT COOKERY,”
by KATE HARRIOTT.
(Recognised by the Australian Trained Nurses’ Association as a Teacher of Invalid Cookery.)
A collection of tried recipes for the use of Australian nurses and home nursing. A copy of this
book should be in every home. Nothing retards a patient’s progress towards recovery so much as
improper feeding and bad cooking.

A “Nelson” Soda Fountain
The attractive, alluring appearance of a “Nelson” Soda Fountain to the hot,
thirsty summer throng is absolutely irresistible.
When men and women are thirsty they will spend their last threepence if
necessary to get the delicious, refreshing drinks you can serve with one of our
f<Hm The*'PROFITS TO BE MADE ARE SIMPLY ENORMOUS, and every
class of retailer is concerned! Hotelkeepers make small fortunes in quick
time. Storekeepers, chemists, refreshment-room owners and others can not only
make gigantic profits from the Soda Fountain but also bring in buyers for other
goods.
This is a “ Worth While ” Proposition !
Our Soda Fountains are in a position by themselves in Australia—absolutely
ahead of all others. They are the “tried and true” kind —manufactured by
skilled workmen who have spent their whole lives in the business. Apprentices
and “down-and-outers” have no place in the Nelson factory—and we don’t use
inferior materials. Mind you, we manufacture only so far as we can put down-
right good quality into the goods. Where we find it better in the interests of our
buyers, we send to America —the Home of the Perfect Fountain. That’s why
Nelson Fountains are in the front rank of the world’s best —that’s why busi-
ness men who have spent their hard cash on “other Australian Fountains” have
scrapped them and installed the “Nelson” kind.
Now, if you want a gold mine and the positive assurance of no after
trouble —get a Nelson Soda Fountain.
WRITE IN TO-DAY for particulars. Every day wasted means loss of
big profits. ASK FOR OUR CATALOGUE and more points “why” it pays
to buy the “Nelson Way.”

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 25, 1913.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The Neglected Children are having a blaze
of charity enthusiasm kindled for their
special benefit. Mrs. Staughton recently in-
vited a hundred people to come and talk the
subject over at the Warrawee Club, and 97
duly turned up. The crush in the comfort-
able little Club was terrific; but a lot of
good suggestions were made, and a cheerful
chink of coin made it worth while.
A number of men were wedged in
amongst the charitable plotters. Mr.
McKinley, of Malvern, accompanied his
wife; and Mr. Danks and Mr.
Armytage also put in an appearance. The
projected fair, or fgte, is to happen in the
Masonic Hall during October.
The Crafts Depot (which is the name of
of the Arts and Crafts’ new venture) is
doing well vice-regally. Governor Fuller
“opened” the show to a throng of people, in
the Auditorium; and now G.-G. Denman,
who was slithering down the sides of Kosci-
usko when the function happened, has prom-
ised to pay a visit. Only the select legion
of Likely Purchasers are invited to rub
shoulders and kick heels with the little
potentate.
Dances are plentiful. People who had not
entertained for a long, long time have rushed
into social publicity as hosts and hostesses,
and no eligible dancer’s feet have had a
chance to get cold. The Melbourne Club,
which had not hired a string band for 20
years, broke out, and began what looks like
a new era. Now the Royal Yacht Club has
stirred itself, after a decade of smoke con-
certs and so forth, and set out to give the
girls some entertainment. The start was
made on Thursday night, when the St. Kilda
Town Hall contained two or three dinghies
and one full-sized yacht. The dome dripped
with scarlet, and the light, filtering through,
fell like a blessing on the complexions be-
neath. All the yachtsmen are acclaimed as
“dears,” and a lot of them have money; con-
sequently, everything was delightful—especi-
ally the supper. Governors blessed the revel
with their presence, and Society followed
like well-shorn sheep. Lesly Madden was
well to the fore during the little vice-regal
welcomings. Mrs. Captain Clarkson and Mrs.
Manisty represented the Navy, while Gen-
eral Gordon, accompanied by daughter Eily,
danced for the Army. Commodore Seymour
Chinch, of the R.Y.C., shepherded all the
important guests, and his enthusiastic table
salts danced so well that hardly anybody
went home until the morning vegetable carts
appeared. Some girls are triumphantly ex-
hibiting thin satin dancing shoes that want
re-soling, but won’t get it, being too valu-
able as trophies. They were worn through
in one glorious evening.
The Children’s Welfare Exhibition is the
alluring title of the next big charity splash.
It is to happen in the Masonic Hall, be-
tween November 18 and 24. A card, bear-
ing a portrait of a little, dimpled face, is
the enticing invitation to a tea-party to be
given by president Mrs. Danks, at the War-
rawee Club, at which the subject will be
well shredded. Alfred Clarke, secretary,
250 Little Collins-street, is willing to an-
swer all inquiries relating to the scheme.
Dancing men should be plentiful enough
at St. Kilda Town Hall next Thursday
week (September 11), when the friends of
the Hyams sisters will give them a com-
plimentary ball. A good many thousands
of citizens, old and young, have learned
their waltzing in a Hyams class, and the
committee have a wide field for the placing
of tickets for the coming hop. Its hours
are 8.30 p.m. till 2 a.m.
The coal carters’ strike almost caused a
full stop in the cafd run by a lady who had
accumulated no reserve stock of fuel. She
was saved by the loyalty of a hungry pack
of medical-student customers, who borrowed
a motor and brought the grimy stuff along.
Beatrice Clarke, youngest girl of the
Bolinda Vale tribe, is pledged to go through
the “I will” ordeal with William Hatchell
Webb. The Bolinda Vale Clarkes are cousins
of the Janet Clarke clan, and all but the
most benighted know it. The fact is men-
tioned here simply because it is a Great
Social Truth ; and Great Social Truths can’t
be mentioned too often.
Mrs. McNichol, who is an abject wor-
shipper of the latest fashion in music, is
giving weekly tea parties at the Winter
Garden, with the local orchestra specially
told off to play selections from the current
Quinlan Opera co.’s show. Society duly
arrives in its most feathered hat, and talks
shrilly against the music. The principal
use of music is to be drowned in conversa-
tion.
Toorak is worrying because a daughter
of one of its wool dukes is said to be booked
for matrimony with a vet. In sporting squat-
ting circles the girls are expected to be pas-
sionately fond of a horse, but they are not
encouraged in devoted attachments to the
horse’s medical man. However, it is quite
time that the vets, were given a fair chance
in competition with the other sort of doc-
tors, who have been the spoilt darlings of
Australia since the earliest dawn of its
peerage.
Bigjohn, Forrest had a birthday last Fri-
day, when many of the most elevated were
bidden to a dinner at the Grand Hotel. The
tables were decorated with delicate spring-
like pink flowers, suggestive of blushing
youth. Dame Forrest, brocaded, ospreyed and
heavily jewelled, made a good hostess ; and
the blue-eyed niece, frocked prettily in blue,
seconded Auntie’s skilled efforts. A long
procession of motors delivered the Best Fed
at the door, where a strip of crimson carpet
waited to be trodden on. The orchestra was
still playing the won’t-go-home-till-morning
air when midnight struck.
The Bananaland Government threatens to
buy a Will Longstaff portrait of Colonel
Tunbridge, who is now stationed at head-
quarters in Melbourne. The portrait, which
has just been completed, is a good likeness
of the grey, stern original who made a
name for himself when he pulled the Aus-
tralians out of a bad place at Elaand’s
River. The artist was one of the
little force that put up the memor-
able fieht. Longstaff had been work-
ing on a battle picture (not yet com-
pleted), and his old commander had been
sitting as one of the figures in the paint and
canvas mgl6e. The separate portrait, which
began casually with a sketch, was completed
in a few sittings. Longstaff has been spend-
ing 12 hours a day studying how to make
quick portraits, and he seems to have dis-
covered the secret. Last week he painted
a portrait of Treasurer Mueller, of the Ben-
digo Galleries, and Bendigo has bought it.
Another portrait which was finished in
quick order is that of pretty Mrs. Callaway,
wife of the rich man who has his house
stuffed with expensive art treasures. (When
a house is really “stuffed” with art treas-
ures the host has to roll priceless things
under the sofa, and dust a chair with his
hat for the chance, admiring caller.)
Ella Harris (daughter of departed race-
horse-owner Victor Harris, who owned one of
the mansion parks along the Papanui-road,
in Christchurch, M.L.) has excited her
Melbourne relations by cabling news of her
engagement to a Johannesburg man. The
said relatives are now breathlessly awaiting
letter news of the overwhelming event. Ella
is an only daughter, and rich beyond the
dreams of the suburbs. Since the death of
Victor Harris, his widow has been travelling
about the earth with her daughter. They
are at present in London, at an hotel which
is much haunted by Australians. One of
the visitors is Mrs. Lake, of Sydney, a sister
of the stage-struck Cooper girls, who have
money to burn, and frequently decorate
Melbourne with their presence. But to
get back to the Harris family. The last
big win the late Harris had was with a
horse that dropped dead just after passing
the judge’s box at Riccarton.
Major Dodds, who is always advocating
the use of the serviceable khaki, and thinks
the loose working shirt of the private a fit
and proper envelope for officers, has just
had a portrait completed in which he appears
in full-dress uniform —every inch of scarlet
on, and every ounce of gold braid showing.
Will Longstaff is the artist, and, whilst
accomplishing a clever portrait, he made
separate poems of the uniform and braid.
Dodds, who seems grimly pleased with the
blinding result, blushingly anologises for the
millinery. “My wife likes it,” he murmurs
submissively.
The flurry about Wireless in the Federal
House drew a lot of women to the galleries,
and the parliamentary flunkeys had to speak
soothingly to the disappointed ones who
were crowded out from all the beautiful ex-
citment. In the intervals of debate, Bruce
Smith and Willie Kelly, both great favorites
with the Sex, showed some of my sisters
round the place where Cook trembles for his
political life, and hangs on.
There was a knotting at Trinity Church,
East St. Kilda, on Wednesday last week.
Pretty Muriel Gudgeon took Guv Henty to
be her wedded husband at 7 o’clock. Sub-
sequently the bride, duly veiled and orange-
blossomed, bore her willing captive to Kiora,
the parental home, where Mr. and
Mrs. William Gudgeon “received” an even-
ing-dressed crowd. By the way, the Gud-
geon family will be assisting at another
after-dusk wedding on the 12th of next
month. Their old friends, Mr. and Mrs.
Charles Atkins, are disposing of daughter
“Bluie” (thus called because her name is
Eileen) to Tom Kay. who formerly taught
mathematics at the Scotch College, and is
now looking after the chemical side of the
manufacturing at the works of his pros-
pective father-in-law. The Atkins-Kay
union is to be solemnised at Christ Church.
South Yarra, and the festivities incidental
thereto will happen at Goodrest, hard by.
Veterinary surgeon Sam Woods, the
Adonis of the local hunting field, is to take
the matrimonial fence shortly with racing
squatter Creswick’s daughter. The damsel,
who is generally in the first flight at a fox
pursuit, has some nice woolly acres of her
own; and, as Sam’s income rolls in at the
rate of thousands a year, she will not want
for pin money.
Doris Shirley Cooke, a red-haired sprite
about the build of Fuck, who won words of
encouragement and advice from Margaret
Cooper when that precise performer was
touring here, is “going in” for the mono-
logue and songs-at-the-piano business. The
young person breaks out entertainingly in
the tea intervals at drawing-room concerts.
The local highbrows trotted along to the
Repertory Theatre Club, the other night, to
absorb Tolstoi, per medium of Sinclaire, the
gentleman with the vivid hair. An amber-
shaded lamp provided just the wrong sort of
illumination for the lecturer, who had
nothing cheerful to say. He stated it as
his opinion that the Repertory Theatre was
putting up a brave but hopeless fight against
theatrical commercialism, and that Art was
going to be killed dead. He saw the corpse
with his mind’s eye. Everybody listened
patiently; and when he had subsided beyond
the radius of the disastrous lamp, Mrs.
Gregan McMahon and other Club ladies hur-
ried round with cups of excellent coffee.
After this reviving draught, several speakers
arose in turn and growled back at Sinclaire.
Three of the most eminent growlers were
historian de Soir, Archibald Strong, and
statistician Knibbs.
The gowning of Jeanne Brola, as La
Tosca, was not nearly as impressive as the
splendor of Way da in her memorable per-
formance. (Dress fanatics still discuss
Wayda’s finery with delight.) Brola, in
the first two acts, had very little trimming
on her light dress, which was built on the
Empire plan. She wore no jewellery to
speak of, and made no great display of
shoulder, whereas the beauteous Wayda was
very generous. In the last act, Brola wore
a half-hoop of brilliants in her hair, and a
smart change of costume which seemed to
suggest that she had been at Court since
plunging the supper knife into Scarpia’s
chest.
“Rhinegold,” the first of the “Ring” operas,
went through in two and a half hours, as
compared with the exhausting five-hour
stretch of “Mastersingers”; so Toorak is
looking with a less terrified eye at the cup
of culture it has set itself to swallow. Two
vice-regal parties attended and endured to
the end. Quinlan has “taken” again like a
successful vaccination, and poor, hard-driven
Mrs. Am-I-In-It? finds she must either
attend or relapse into the dressing-gowns
and curl-papers of the Socially Lost. “Rhine-
gold,” being submarine and somnolent, tried
the aspiring lady sorely in the first act. The
occasional thud of a dropped opera glass
reminded the house that some silken-lapped
dame had dozed in the restful shadows of
the reserved seats, while the stage gloomed
musically in green and gold limelight.
One flapper poseuse raised a cynical titter
by stalking in (with her sister) bearing a
large-sized score of the music. This volume
she fixed at a suitable angle for reading.
But the affectation was a waste of time, for
the light was far too dim to read by. One
musical critic prided himself on his foresight
in having spared himself the trouble of
changing into evening clothes for the en-
gloomed function. ,
A prominent visiting musician has given
operatic endurance-testers a severe shock by
admitting, after the first night’s overdose of
five hours’ Wagner, that, though he wor-
shipped the great composer, he had never
before listened to a whole Wagner opera at
one sitting. But, whatever people may do
elsewhere, Melbourne likes to get its money’s
worth. If it buys a seat for five hours of
grand opera, well, it will go and sit in that
seat until its brain is reeling and its eyes
feel boiled.
Edna Thornton, who was the abundant
siren last year in “Tales of Hoffmann,”
turned up again on Thursday, as a rather
hard-baked Delilah, with black hair hanging
in severe lines over the well-developed chest
of the Philistines. She marred the Delilah
costume scheme by being corseted in the
hour-glass severity of the mid-Victorian era.
Samson looked like a very stout masseur,
and he toppled the temple over in a casual
way that showed the prepared joints or
breaks too soon. But, of course, his high
notes were of most importance to him at
that excruciating moment. A plhmp ballet
gyrated in mauve chiffon with galah pink
scarves. The members thereof looked rather
like parrots, when those impudent birds
prance round a newly-sown wheat paddock.
Stalled listeners are enduring the orchestra’s
melodious uproar fairly well; but one deaf-
ened lady had to give it best the other even-
ing, and totter in a half-fainting condition
to the well-guarded doors. It is as hard to
get out as it is to get in.
Voghera, the little brush-haired Italian,
is again shaking the baton at the fine Quin-
lan orchestra. He has triumphantly brought
back his talented first violin —or rather the
gentleman who works it. Mr. Propsting is
his name, and he was so ill with nervous
breakdown, after last season, that he nearly
ceased bowing and scraping for ever. Con-
ductor Voghera watched him with the soli-
citous care of a whole family, and is quite
proud of his recovered patient. He looks
upon him as a genius, and, of course, no
genius can be spared.
Jeanne Brola, the American contralto
with the Quinlan co., has brought her large
husband along with her this trip. He is
Mr. Harrison, a citizen of the U.S.A. Jeanne
sort of revised her family name of Brookes
for stage purposes ; but, as she is a grand-
daughter, or some such relative, of General
Brookes, of Virginia, the name should be
good enough for anything save theatrical
advertising.
“Rosna” writes from London :
Now that all the British critics have succumbed
to the charm and genius of Percy Grainger’s folk-
music, the Americans are preparing to do likewise.
The golden-locked Australian was unknown and un-
boomed in Uncle Sam’s territory, until two of his
choruses were given lately by the famous Macdowell
choir in Noo Yark. They were the sensation of the
show, and one of the leading papers said with
fervor: “One is almost tempted to say they are the
best things that have ever come to us from Eng-
land.” About the time this remark will reach you,
two new works by Percy will burst on the
British public by way of the gorgeous Balfour-
Gardiner concerts at the Queen’s Hall. But can
anyone tell me why “musical” Australia is so
frostily indifferent to the really charming songs,
choruses and orchestral outbursts of its own greatest
composer ? While Europe is down on its knees beg-
ging him for more, Australian music-sellers a™ „ ,
ing packets of his stuff back unopened and Mr d '
him, in effect, that of course he can’t write

Esther Patterson has just finished a nor
trait of Nordica—a clever crayon head fnli
of life and expression. The singer, who
for the young artist during the intervals at
each concert, is carrying the portrait back
to America. *
The Nordica clothes and diamonds always
demand separate mention. The diamonds
she wore in her ears shone like tram head
lights, and on her head she supported the
grandfather of all ospreys. Her dress was
a simple, girlish thing of satin and gossamer
on which someone had embroidered a e-r’
land of pink and white daisies. The whole
outfit would have suited a rich debutante
but for the diamond ear-flaps. No blossom-
ing bud ever possessed stone searchlights
like that.
A visiting young American star, who has
helped to put up a record theatrical run is
said to be threatened with matrimony. She
has a long string of worshippers; but a
bachelor mummer has always been well in
the lead. During a recent cafd supper, some
friends fried to force a confession or some-
thing by showering the two with rose leaves
and inciting the band to play the Wedding
March. However, the two just grinnert
blushfully and were silent.
Half the Thursday afternoon audience at
“The Man on the Box” fluttered bashfully
stagewards to take the hospitable teacup
from the hands of handsome Hugh Buckler
and the Paget vision. The teapot having
failed to arrive, a homely brass urn served
instead. One small boy who had been towed
up the gangway by his fond mother was
carefully overfed by Hugh and his wife, who
grow enthusiastic over infants of all ages
and sizes. They have a pretty pair of their
own in England.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The Butt-Rumford season opened on Saturday in
the Exhibition. She wore a wonderful red velvet
garment, relieved by touches of white, and consider-
ably entranced by about 14,350 diamonds. When I
say that she sang up to the level of her tailoring,
you will get some idea of the bliss that local music-
iovers experienced.
On Monday the Lyric Club, ever ready to feed the
needy and entertain the forlorn and deserted and
lonely, asked the visiting artists to listen to some
music and a slice of drama (an act from “The
Liars,” presented by the Appendreena Dramatic
Club). Also, to eat some supper. Needless to say,
the famished stars accepted joyfully. Mrs. Butt
again wore velvet and about quarter of an acre of
diamond and pearl ornaments.
Mrs. F. J. Fisher’s dance in Buxton-street, on
Friday, was highly appreciated. She wore pink and
purple flowered silk, veiled in purple ninon with
drapings of lace. Her daughter was in blue, with
Oriental embroideries. Miss Lowe’s smart frock was
of green and gold shot ninon, and Mrs. David Welkie
was in pink-flowered ninon, veiling pink satin. Others
present were —well, their name was legion.
Mrs. Culross gave a dance at Glenora, South Ter-
race, on Tuesday. A yellow-bedecked marquee had
been erected for dancing, and supper was served on
tables decorated with bowls of sweet-pea. Mrs.
Culross was in black satin, and was helped in the
business of hostessing by her daughters—one in
green, with pale pink roses, and the other in rose-
pink and silver. Her married daughter, Mrs. Roy
Burston, was in white, with draperies of beautiful
lace. Miss Campell wore a striking frock of purple
ninon veiling tangarine satin, and Mrs. Hoad was a
smart figure in black.
There was another ball the same night—that in
aid of the Royal British Nurses’ Association. A
foolish and ill-judged circumstance, considering the
many blank and featureless evenings we have during
the year. Of course, the Glenora dance and the
Butt-Rumford concert told depressingly against the
attendance. Lady Bosanquet was there in a smart
admixture of violet ninon and tangerine satin —
with one daughter in white and green, and the
other in pink satin and white lace.
Wayville—a recently developed southern suburb
—has produced a sort of genius. Mr. G. J. Kinder-
mann, of that hamlet, has invented a scrubbing
brush, or some such apparatus, driven by electricity,
whereby a vessel’s hull may be scoured without put-
ting it in dry dock.
The late W. C. Rigby’s estate, valued at £12,000
odd, will, after the death of his daughters, go to
form a perpetual trust, from the funds of which
cottage homes may be built from time to time.
Talking of wills, ex-Senator Vardon’s estate has
been sworn at £19,500.
Mr. W. T. Mortlock, who died on Sunday, married
a daughter of recently-deceased Andrew Tennant. He
was educated at St. Peter’s College, and then went
to Cambridge, and afterwards read for the law at
the Inner Temple. However, he dropped law for
land, and, like his father-in-law, held big pastoral
properties. He was in Parliament for a time, and
was a keen racing and hunting man.
The A.R.C. had a big attendance -at its Grand
National meeting, at Victoria Park, on Saturday.
In the Fullarton Steeplechase The Swell landed a
£34 dividend for his supporters. Mr. James was
successful in both the Tennyson Handicap and the
Lightning Handicap, and Mr. Keith Bowman secured
the Grand National Hurdle. It is queer that the
Bowman clan seems always to have better luck on
the old course than at Morphettville. Lady Bosanquet
kept an interested eye on events in a becoming coat
and skirt of mauve, and her daughters also displayed
well-cut tailor-mades. Valia came to grief in a
bad smash in the first race, and had to be de-
stroyed, and Hispan was killed in the Hurdles—
which was bad luck for a day when the going was
good.
From London comes word that Muriel Matters,
the Adelaide reciter, who went to London and turned
militant suffragette, has also agreed to plunge into
matrimony with Dr. William Porter, of New York,
now curing the ills of the Great Fog.
Sincerely yours,

Coola’ : I’ll back Bill as the champion
leg-puller. The other day he picked up a “good
thing” for the hurdles. Out we went to the course
and handed in our contribution to the upkeep of
Moses. Between us we sported only one pair of
A PUZZLER.
COUSIN JACK NO. 1: "I'm some proud t’ see
'ee back, 'Siah. ’Ow d’ ’ee enjoy ' self down
Adelaide? ”
COUSIN JACK NO. 2: "Not bad, Billy, boy;
but everybody I spake lo said, ‘Dost thee
come from Moonta?' And what I caant
maake out is, ow they all knawed I ded
come from Moonta. Cou’st ’ee see?”
glasses. Bill, being the taller, appropriated them,
and promised to describe the race. “Good start,”
he said, “our gee-gee’s goin’ fine, jumpin’ boskm-”
and so on right through. Finally: “One more jump
to go. ...Now for the run home. ... Hooray, he’s
won!” and pitched my hat in tiie air. Then he
turned and asked if I had a knife. “Knife? What
for?” “To cut me throat! The dam thing fell at
the first hurdle and it’s been dead for three minutes."
“I linderino” : In the cemetery at Cairns
(N.Q.) I found a weather-worn wooden slab bearing
this concise epitaph:—
TOMMY.
Kicked by a pony.
“Vigilans”: There are some yague, not
to say opaque, ideas about Far Northern Australian
islands. Bathurst and Melville islands, measured
together, pan put at about 115 miles long and 37
broad. The former, which contains 786 square
miles, is not inhabited by whites. Both islands are
suitable for agriculture, rubber and cocoanut culti-
vation. On Bathurst there are a large number of
gutta-percha trees which contain a coagulating sub-
stance much resembling rubber. We boiled some of
this, and when it cooled and dried it turned out in
a solid mass which could be bounced like a ball.
Cooper Camp, where the buffalo hunters have their
headquarters, lies in a lovely valley surrounded by
bills rising 600 ft. above sea level. The valley con-
tains gum, pandanus and gutta-percha trees. Palms,
herbage and grass grow prolifically. The fertile con-
dition is due to springs. One of these is icy cold,
and of great purity. After a hot ride, a bath here
is glorious. Birdlife is abundant, consisting of
Java geese, pelicans, macaw, white egrets, duck of
various kinds, teal, herons and many other varieties
of waterfowl. But the most beautiful bird on the
landscape is the scarlet ibis. In no other part of
Australian waters is this magnificent bird at large.
Pearlshell has been found in small quantities, and
the waters are alive with turtle. It was on
Buchanan Island that our old friend, Louis de
Rougemont, rode the turtle and found that faithful
nigger wench Yamba. Riding turtle is by no means
a myth; I have ridden the ironclad prawn myself.
The girls of Melville are the finest specimens of
aboriginal womanhood—tall, straight, quick and
prepossessing. Why the Malays didn’t “jump” these
islands is hard to say. They have visited them for
centuries, but perhaps the time is not yet ripe.

“P.K.”; Re the Timaru (M.L.) man (B.
31/7/’l3) who broke just about everything he had
to break and was mended. Compared with a man
who has just met with a slight mishap on the S.A.-
Vic. border, the Maorilander is a mere novice at the
business. At least, I take a Victorian up-country
paper s word for it. Here it is, from the Lawloit
Times :
Mr. Jas. Coutts, who was mustering sheep in the
south scrub, met with an unpleasant experience. The
horse shied and became unmanageable, struck a grass
tree, and horse and rider came with great force to
the ground. Mr. Coutts escaped with a broken
neck, which he had given £25 for a short time pre-
viously and had to walk and carry his saddle and
bridle.
The M.L. chap had to be carried home, but this one
walked and carried his saddle and bridle. Also he
hadn’t had the neck for long, so it’s evidently not
the first one he’s broken. Still it seems to be his
own fault—you can’t expect much of a neck for £25.
* * * *
Gouger : On the way to Oooktown you
can see plainly from the coastal steamer’s deck the
curious landmark known now as Mt. Peterbot a
corruption, I believe, of an old Dutch name. Only a
very few prospectors have ever been near the summit
of this wild mountain. Overtopping it
are two enormous rocks, one somewhat
resembling a crouching figure and one
suggestive of a person standing upright.
As usual, there is a native legend regard-
ing these rocks. A buck enticed away a
girl from a neighboring tribe, and a
younger sister followed the older one for
company. Big trouble followed, and one
day the two tribes met on a plain to
settle the difficulty. Romeo’s tribe, see-
ing that Juliet’s following was far more
numerous, suggested to Romeo that the
quarrel would possibly have more plea-
sant results if there were no spears in
it. Thereupon Romeo walked to the
centre of the plain, and called out to all
and sundry in a loud voice that he would
settle this argument himself. He there-
upon took the two sisters to the summit
of Peterbot. Turning to the elder girl
the splendid Wowser said, “You are
the elder, and have done wrong in induc-
ing your sister to run away. You, there-
fore, shall suffer for it; but the young
girl, on account of her tender age, shall
go free.” Ho thereupon cracked Juliet
on the head with his womera, and she is
the stone in the crouching attitude. Her
sister stood by her, weeping, while Romeo
turned his back and climbed down the
mountain. When he turned to see what
he had done, the younger sister immediately froze
into stone, too, and there the two poor things have
been to this day, and there they are likely to stay
until the Pyramids blow away in dust.

A.L.B. : Pick” (B. 17/7/’l3) says
dingoes don’t hunt in packs. In the same para-
graph he mentions that he frightened dozens from
his camp, they being after a bear he was roasting.
If they don’t hunt in packs, what were dozens doing
after one bear ? I well remember on Boatman
Station (Charleville, Q.) coming upon an absolutely
noiseless pack of five dingoes working a mob of
about 500 sheep. They had killed 18 when I
arrived, and were still going strong. Three dogs held
the mob in a corner while the others killed. Fur-
thermore, the Jingera Range (N.S.W.) isn’t the
most dingo-filled place in Australia. If “Pick”
visited the Pa rod country (Q.) he would be on the
winning locality. “Pick’s” knowledge of the dingo
isn t extensive, in my opinion. Eighteen months or
so back I remember him with a par in The Bulle-
Tra, wherein he said an ordinary rabbit-fcnce was
suffident to hold a dingo back. If he’d said it could
hold turtles back I might have believed him. In
the corner of Queensland mentioned above dingoes
are multiplying, despite 9ft. dog-proof fences, the
top half of which is set at a different angle to the
bottom half. The dingo, I regret to say, doesn’t
care one bark or howl for either half.
THE DOUBT.
THE PARENT : “Now, Mounseer, I will not 'ave 'A ro Id miss fellin' names in ’is French
exercises. ’ Ere ’e 'as Nicholas without an ‘h' and Sappho with one ‘p.’”
THE TUTOR : “That is the way the French people spell them."
THE PARENT: “Yes; but do they know ou to spell!"
In “Across Australia” (published in
1912), the distinguished work of Baldwin Spencer,
professor of biology in the Melbourne University,
and F. T. Gillen, sub-protector of aborigines for
South Australia, the argument as to the dingo’s
courage and methods of aggression receives some
consideration. We are told that—
There was a time when the Tasmanian “tiger” and
devil, as they are popularly called, the former
one of the largest and the latter the fiercest of our
marsupials, lived in Australia... .The extinction of
the “tiger ’ and the “devil” on the mainland can
only be associated with the fact that here they
came into competition with the dingo, which ex-
terminated them. The dingo hunts in packs. Per-
sonally, he is a skulking coward, whereas the “devil”
is a fierce little beast who will stand up against
any odds. Unfortunately for himself, he has no idea
of organisation ; if only he had he could easily have
beaten the dingo. The result has been that the
“devil,” though individually a very much braver
animal than his enemy, was vanquished by the
latter, who somehow came to realise the vaiue of
organisation.
Which seems fairly definite, the more so that Spencer
and Gillen are noted as being gluttons for definite-
ness.

According to James McNabb, farmer and
chairman of directors of Shepparton (Vic.) Butter
kactory, the Australian cow is becoming a failure,
and the great cowfat industry threatens to flee the
country. The impending calamity has nothing to do
with the Rural Workers’ log this time; that gag
was dropped as soon as the Referendum proposals
were defeated. The animal herself is to blame. In
McNabb s words the trouble lies in “the complete
inability of the average Victorian dairy cow to pay for
her oats by means of her milk yield.” Especially is
this the case among the closer settlement irrigators,
who are consequently “abandoning cow keeping and
devoting their energies to other forms of rural pro-
duction.” McNabb considers that the Australian
cow must yield 2001 b. of butter-fat annually to
prove profitable. She doesn’t do this, by a long
chalk. He further told the shareholding farmers
that Denmark had raised the average yearly yield of
butter-fat per cow from 1121 b. to 2211 b., and they
would have to do likewise; but in the meantime
how the irrigation settlers were to be provided with
profitable cows was an urgent problem. So it is a
safe gamble that the next howl of the sturdily anti-
Socialistic person on the Victorian land will be for
the importation of a herd of high-class State or
municipal bulls.

“Lagani Namo”: I called the man who
told me what I’m going to tell you an auctioneer,
and on the subsequent bet I lost a bottle of whisky.
He said that many of the old native women of
Papua could tell the gender of a child months be
it was born. I shook my head. Then the bet was
made on a pending case. I lost. Made several simi-
lar bets and lost every time. Talking about Papuan
infants, nerve-strung white fathers will be interested
to learn that they do not “squall.” The mothers
carry them about in net bags along with yams, fire-
wood, cooking pots, etc. When ma has gardening
or other strenuous work to do, the bag is hung on
the handiest projection, and left there for hours, i
need be. Should a whimper emerge, ma charges to
the rescue, knou mg full well that the pigs have
begun scoffing the kid, or that a Gin. sprinter has
run into its body. But, no matter how serious the
case, the tucker bag always holds the immediate
remedy.
“Ginger” : The N.T. buffalo takes to the
domesticating process like a navvy to long beers.
Moombooldool station (N.S.W.) acquired three bulls
for crossing with the shorthorn and evolving a faster-
walking working bullock. The idea was a failure.
The buffalo turned out real wasters, of dirty habits
and lazy as a blaclcfellow. No respectable cow would
have anything to do with them. In fact, they were
ostracised by the leading members of Bull Society.
They spent the day alternately wallowing in the
tank, lying in the shade of the travellers’ hut, and
exploring the pig bucket. They got so tame a man
couldn't kick them out of his way. I can't say if
they begot any mule bullocks ; I never saw any of
their progeny. They were, I know, ultimately re-
tained merely as a general nuisance and a blot oa
the station landscape.
ONE WA Y.
“So you claim to be a literary man, eh?”
“ Yes, sir, I wrote the famous book, 'A Dozen
Ways to Make a Living.’”
“And yet you are begging!”
“Yes, sir, that's one of the ways.”
“Flinderino”: The settlers on the Vic-
torian coast about the r owlett River found their
land was being encroached on by sand drifting up
from the beach. The Public Works Department was
appealed to, with the result ‘hat marram gras6 was
planted along the coast. Tit then bunny was only
of small dimensions, but with the advent of the
grass the burrowing pest has multiplied exceedingly,
and now threatens to devour the district. Poison is
being lavishly spread over the landscape, and the
cookies are talking about a referendum to decide
which they will have —rabbits or sand. It looks at
present as though they may have to make the best
of both.

THE SENSITIVE SPUD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Professor Ewart, of Melbourne, lecturing on
“Senses in Plants,” admitted that a plant has no
soul to be saved ; but, said he, “it is a living 1 being
capable of feeling, and able to respond to sensa-
tions. Furthermore, “it has a certain dignity in
common with God’s highest creation.”
Too long have we misunderstood
The blushing carrot slim and shy ;
We did not think we need be good
In presence of the broccoli;
The turnip pale we tossed aside—
We thought the turnip had no pride;
We cut the lettuce anywhere—
We thought the lettuce did not care!
But now we know that tears may start
From “taters” in a ruthless clutch ;
The cabbage has a feeling heart,
Though it may not look up to much.
If treated with grave disrespect
'The cauliflower does not object,
But wilts in silence, proudly free
From nervous irritability.
The onion most of all the row
Has suffered from our conduct rude;
We’ve treated it without a show
Of chivalry or gratitude.
This bruised victim well may prise
Hot tears from unaccustomed eyes ;
But round her most appealing woes
The breath of scandal ever flows.
Come, singing Roderic, strike your lyre;
And, Bernard, sit you down and write!
The sweet Spring onion should inspire
Spring poets to a finer flight.
Rhyme marrow’s strength, the pea’s romance,
The cool cucumber’s arrogance,
And give our callous age to see
Tomato s regal dignity.
VICTORIA.

A Battery Truck Craive
m
s» gmim;
Severe tests, covering an extended period at the
Bush Terminal Company, New York, and at the
Schenectady factory of the General Electric Com-
pany, and also at the No. 12 dock, Melbourne, have
proven the great worth of the Battery Truck Crane.
It is now offered to those who wish to extend the
storage capacity of a given floor space, or reduce
the cost and time of handling, freight, castings,
etc.
The Battery Truck Crane is an automobile battery
truck, with an electric crane mounted in the front
end. The operator has complete control of the
crane and vehicle.
THE CRANE WITH A 60-MILE BOOM.
The Truck Crane can go a moderate distance, and
get back, with a load on its hook, quicker than the
same load can be lifted on to any other kind of
vehicle. It does the work of from 3to 30 horses
and drivers, or on hand work from 5 to 14 men.
This truck has moved one million pounds of small
package freight 600 ft. in 19 hours, and 600,000
pounds of cotton one half-mile in a (lay.
The truck has proved itself well adapted for service
between cranes in shops, for handling material
between shops, or in storage yards not covered by
cranes. Send for Battery Truck Crane Bulletin

YOUTHFUL COMPLEXIONS FOR ALL.
Examination and research show that ail
the beauties of the complexion actually
exist in the dermis or true skin, which in
childhood is covered by a thin, transparent
scarf skin, called the epidermis, through
which the delicate, rosy complexion of the
true skin glows in all its beauty. As years
are added, the true skin remains the same,
but the minute scales of which the scarf
skin is built up from beneath grow thicker
and harder, and do not fall oft’ when they
become dead and useless ; consequently the
scarf skin becomes thick, lined, wrinkled
and discolored, completely hiding the beau-
tiful natural complexion which still exists
in the true skin beneath, and can only be
brought to light by removing the layers of
dead and useless scales of the scarf skin.
Snap and water and cold creams will re-
move a few of the loosest scajesj but the
closely packed layers of dead outer tissue
can only be removed by means of a solvent,
such as the vegetable wax called parinol
wax. which seems to possess the remarkable
property of penetrating into and gradually
loosening and removing all the dead caked
scales which have hidden and disfigured the
complexion. Every lady should get. a supply
of pure parinol wax and apply it to the
face each night, and in the morning, when
washing it off. much of the dead scarf skin
will come with it. Continue this regularly,
aud note the marvellous improvement in
your skin and eomplexion.*
“Eddyson”: Hadfield and Buyer were
pioneer selectors at Quandong. Both were hatters.
Hadfield was a frugal and temperate person; but
Buyer, when the fit was on him, would drink whisky
until little pink devils, like curses, came home to
roost. Buyer was violent in whisky, and at a cer-
tain stage in the rapid progress of his jag always
conceived a violent antipathy to Hadfield, whom he
accused of stealing the bottles of whisky off his
posts, it being Buyer's pleasant custom to plant such
bottles on several of the posts of the fence fronting
his hut, and amuse himself wandering from post to
post, taking refreshment by the way. When he
came to a post that hadn’t a bottle on it he jumped
to the conclusion that Hadfield had broken the
pleasant continuity, and he went out after poor
Hadfield, seeing blood-red. Hadfield was a small
man of a shrinking disposition; Buyer was a large
man, with a torso like an ice-ch*>t and a bellow
that shook the big hills. Consequently, when Had-
field saw Buyer coming over the logs at him, with a
prop in one hand and a long rope in the other, at
noon on the eleventh day of December, 1911, he
promptly took to the woods. Hadfield took after him.
It was a long chase. Hadfield did his best, and an
occasional bellow from his pursuer lent extraordi-
nary vigor to his heels. Buyer was not in as good
nick, but was too far gone in D. Tremens to remem-
ber his physical defects, and for two miles he was
right on top of his nimble neighbor, his wild eyes
ablaze with the lust for slaughter. Utterly ex-
hausted, Hadfield at last fled for cover into a wom-
bat hole under a rock ; but Buyer, roaring jubilantly
all the time, poked him out with the prop. Then
Buyer seized Hadfield, aud his insane shouts of rap-
ture filled the woods with awful echoes. He dragged
his limp victim to a tree, and tied the helpless
wretch to the trunk, very securely, most painfully,
after which he sat off and gibed at him. Poor
Hadfield, he insisted, had whiskers made of seven-
and-eighty snakes aud wore a large green octopus in
each eye. “But what was I goin’ t’ do t’ yell?”
said Buyer in occasional quieter and more thought-
ful moments. “What was it I meant t’ do t’ yeh?”
The problem distressed him. Suddenly he remem-
bered. Yelling with joy, he jumped to his feet, and
darted about, collecting bark, sticks, dry branches
and fallen limbs. Gaily he stacked these round his
tethered prey,, bellowing so exuberantly the while
that Hadfield's entreaties and expostulations went
for nothing. Presently a great heap of highly inflam-
mable material was piled about Hadfield. His fact
alone was visible. Standing with a matchbox in his
hand Buyer barked viciously at the helpless inno-
cent, reviling him for many iniquities, but more par-
ticularly for the green octopus in each eye and the
wicked snakes in his whiskers. Then Buyer had
another lapse of memory. “But what was I goin’ t’
do to yeh?” he said. With the matchbox in his
hand and the firewood piled about Hadfield right be-
fore his eyes, he suffered paroxysms of fury in his
inability to recollect what he was going to do. Once
he looked at the matches, and from the matches to
the pyre, and Hadfield’s heart died within him ; but
Buyer's mind refused to act. He was sitting, think-
ing desperately, when a rescue party, collected by a
boy who had seen the blood-curdling cross-country
run, arrived. Buyer hailed them with delight.
“Good!” he cried. “Good, good! You can tell me
what I was goin’ to do t’ the cow!” As it was,
Hadfield nearly died of what the doctors called
shock, and when he came out of hospital he sold his
holding to Doyle. Doyle is a big man, with two
big sons. They just knock Buyer on the head when
he gets obstreperous, and the neighbors live very
happily together.

“Jimmie Pannikin” : I beg to be allowed
to blow out “Adelaide’s” nomination for the Good
Australian competition; he hasn’t a hope of win-
ning against the Outback bairn whom I “inspected”
at Goatangalah, beyond West-o’-Sunset. 1 asked
this son of the sand and saltbush what he called the
English, Irish, Scotch and Welsh. “Foreigners!”
he said, promptly and proudly. When I had got
my breath again, I said, “Why is Australia one of
the greatest countries in the world? Give me your
reasons slowly, one after the other.” Billy Belar
gave me one simple, splendid, satisfactory series of
reasons: “Because I was born in Australia; me father
an’ mother were born in Australia; and so were me
gran’father and me gran’mother.”

“Tiaki” : The dearest piece of ground ever
bought in M.L. is situated at Mangatainoka, where
tux beer is cultivated in order to cope with the
demand of the adjacent “dry” districts. Koko Kara-
tina was one of the Maori contingent who graced
Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee.
Koko is a very plausible and
stately-looking savage, and on
the return voyage he made the
acquaintance of an English gent.,
one who was coming out to the
tottery isles. The warrior soon
got into touch with the lawyer
and confided that he (Koko) was
“te pig tchief” in M.L., but ex-
cesses at the Jubilee had cut him
out of ready cash, and he was
willing to sell a very valuable
section in an important inland
town for £2so—about half its
value, as magnificent public
buildings adjacent made it a
most desirable lot. A stipulation
was made that Koko was to have
the right to re-buy at an ad-
vanced figure when his rents came
in. The deal was made, and in
due course the buyer sent to an
up-country firm to complete the
transfer and report on the value,
etc. When he was informed that
the allotment was in a native vil-
lage and the outside value £2O,
the Recording Angel’s pen grew
red-hot in following the remarks
of Six-and-Eight. On another
occasion’Koko, again cashless, ap-
plied to “te Rand Court” to suc-
ceed to his father’s interests. The
Court officials found everything
in order, bar the date of his
father’s decease. Then it trans-
pired that Koko, senior, was still in the land of
dried shark and long shandies, so a prospective Hnd
sale was killed in the bud. '
“Langani”: In the Intestate Estates
Office at Port Moresby (Papua) there is a grim re-
cord of a, tragedy of the early days. It is a diary
with this final entry: “Mogquitoes in millions. Sent'
shooting-boy for mail: Haft been away three days;
not yet returne— ” Then the pen spluttered, and
the page is stiff and stained, for the shooting-boy
had returned and banged the diarist’s head off just
as his hand' was putting the final letter to the inac-
curacy.
“Bad Australian” (from Argentina) :
I have long since lost the virulent prejudice I
had against the mule, the inborn prejudice that all
Australians have to the “Sign of the Cross” i» either
man or'beast.
I have used the despised “mewil” to the extent of
about 1500 of him on one job, and I feel good about
him.
On that job he humped sand, cement, cast-iron
pipes, Decauville track, sawn timber, tubular steel,
telegraph poles, galvanised iron, dead men, sleepers,
wire mattresses, Yankee organs, “funnygraffs,”
dynamite, whisky, beer, distinguished visitors and a
thousand other things of no account.
„ He translated this freight from a point about
7000 ft. above sea level to varying heights up to
13,000 ft. He shinned up places where a fly could
hardly follow, and slid down again until his hocks
were worn fiat. He worried through snow, at times
so deep that he had to breathe through his ears.
He broke his neck and every bone in his carcase
falling over precipices. But the part of him that
remained delivered the goods every time. He did
all this on a handful of dried alfalfa and an oc-
casional drink of snow water eked out by as much
ill-treatment and “Goddam” with frills on it as
Indian and half-breed “arrieros” felt like dealing out
to him, yet out of the 1500 of him I did not see one
lift a hoof in retaliation during the three years’ pil-
grimage.
He has humped me for days across the roof of the
world in the Central Andes, at an altitude of
12,000 ft., where you fry at midday and freeze hard
after sundown, and he never raised any kind of ob-
jection, even after 92 miles on end across the
Desert of Atacama, without grub or water. I
always call this a day’s ride, as I was raised amongst
cockatoos and haven’t got rid of the cocky’s method
of reckoning time yet. Finally, I have found
friend mule a very useful citizen after his spirit
had departed. Cut into strips and dried he is
as toothsome as the bull beef we used to steep in
the harness cask in the dear old mountain home,

“T.F.M.” : As regards the early attempts
to colonise the North, “Larrakeeyah” ( B .
is right in challenging the assertion of “No I
porta” that the Raffles Bay enterprise was tr
ferred to Escape Cliffs; but I, in turn, challenge
Larrakeeyah” when he says that the unhealthiness
of the site at Raffles Bay necessitated a move in
1830 to Port Essington. In 1824 Gordon Bremer
was despatched to Coburg Peninsula, and in due
course dropped his killick in Port Essington with'
intent to form a settlement there. A scanty , a
precarious water-supply led to a speedy removal 7
Melville Island, where a settlement was
which had a struggling kind of existence till earl
in 1829, it was transferred to Raffles Bav and
amalgamated with a colony founded by Cantab
Stirling in 1827. But presently, owing to the hos
tility of Binghi, Raffles Bay was also pronounced to
be quite unsuitable for white colonisation so in
August, 1829, it was abandoned, and with it the
whole of the Northern coast. There was certainly
no settlement in existence at Port Essington in
1830, and if there is any statement to that effect in
the volume “Larrakeeyah” mentions—Wilson Earl's
“Enterprise in Tropical Australia”— the author
makes a serious error. It was not till eight years
after the abandonment of Raffles Bay that Gordon
Bremer made another attempt to plant a colony at
Port Essington, in conjunction with Owen Stanley
Again the result was failure. After this little crowd
had suffered trials and tribulations for 12 years, Port
Essington was deserted in 1849—and that’s the sort
of “port” it still is. Every nautical authority who
has set eyes on it has pronounced it to be one of
the finest and most capacious harbors in the world
and certainly the best on our Northern shore line!
Admiral P. P. King had seen Port Jackson many
times, yet he described the harbor he discovered anil
named Port Essington as being the most superb he
had ever entered. Stokes, of the Beagle, expressed
himself to somewhat similar effect, though he had
just previously been one of the discoverers of Port
Darwin; and Captain Pasco, R.N., had made the
acquaintance of the latter harbor when he reported
that the future capital of Northern Australia was
surely destined to be built on Port Essington. This
fine harbor—it cannot have silted up in the interim
—lies in close proximity to Torres Strait, and
from the naval strategist’s point of view must be
infinitely superior to Darwin. Yet I doubt whether
many of the politicians who indulge in beautiful
nebulosities about the North could point it out to
you without studying the map to find it.

“F.H.R.”; ’Twas the night of the ball
given to celebrate the opening of the ’possum sea-

institution this raffle was —and was shouting for a
few of the boys at the pub. There were 17 of us
all told, and Ginger put down a dingo scalp (10s.)
to pay for the liquid. We had got a bit away
before Ginger found the publican had given him
the wrong change. “Strike me pink!” he says.
(He was as red as a box of vestas already.) “What’s

THE SMELL.
THE WOWSER : "My goodfellow, you have been

duced to “Whistling Dick,” the grey shrike thrush,
snake-murderer. Strangely enough, Richard's deadly
repugnance to the beast that walks on its waistcoat
has not been noted by our ornithologists; anyhow,
Hall makes no mention of it. The bird swoops and
strikes his snakeship on the back of the head, car-
ries him treeward, and puts the beak in to the
finish. The carcase is then eaten raw and washed
down with beer from the creek.
THE MARK OF THE BEAST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He wore a quaint, old bell-topped cap,
Some curious pants, a buckled shoe.
Most woeful was the kiddy’s hap—
He blubbered much, and swore a few.
The Boy from Manly well I knew.
He showed a damaged arm, and spoke.
“I am Australia,” said he.
“See what they’re doing to a bloke;
They’re daily vaccinating me—
This is the cow-mark that you see!
“I’ve had my share, you will allow,
Of Spot, and Strawberry, and Bess.
One long demnition round of cow
Has been my sorry lot, I guess,
Since I a blessed teat could press.

The same the long year round, I vow.
It seems Fate's most malicious spite
That, when misfortune grips me now,
There’s nought to dose me with but cow!”

The Bishop of Bath and Wells writes: “The
value of Formamint as a preventive is
appreciated in this house.’’
The Archdeacon of Bristol writes: “I habitually
carry Wulfing’s Formamint with me as a
preventive of Sore Throat.”
The Earl of Kilmorey writes : “I am glad to give
my testimony to the soothing and curative
effects of your potent remedy—Formamint,
with which lam so familiar. As is my
constant practice, I keep one of your brown
bottles on my dressing table.”
How to Avoid Infectious Diseases.
Do you realise that most of the dangerous infectious
diseases, such as Diphtheria. Consumption, Influenza, Scarlet
Fever, Measles and the like, are caused by germs which gain
entrance to the body through the mouth and throat ?
The minute living organisms which produce such diseases
grow and develop like the seeds of plants, and the mouth and
throat form an ideal hot-house for cultivating them.
The scientist, of course, can grow them outside the body,
artificially. For example, a test-tube culture of the germs
which cause Consumption is depicted here ; and also a bottle
of Wulfing’s Formamint—the means which Science has found
to destroy such germs in the mouth and throat, and so protect
us against the diseases which they breed.
TV WULFING *S • .

THE GERM-KILLING THROAT TABLET
These harmless and palatable tablets contain tiie most
powerful destroyer of disease germs known to Science. They
dissolve in the saliva, and the disinfectant is thus carried to
every little crevice, chink, or cranny in the mouth, gums,
tonsils and throat. Thus all germ growths are sought out and
destroyed, their spread is checked, their power to do harm is
entirely broken.
As a preventive of infectious disease, Formamint Tablets
should be used daily by everyone, in health or sickness, and
they are particularly recommended for school children, who
are so exposed to infection, especially at this time of the year.
Beware, however, of harmful imitations ; there is only one
genuine Formamint, viz. Wulfing’s, and all Chemists sell it at
2s. 6d. per bottle. The manufacturers, A. Wulfing & Co.,
17, Bond Street, Sydney, N.S.W., will gladly send you a Free
Sample and an interesting Booklet, if you write to them,
mentioning this paper, and enclose two penny stamps towards
postage.
Mi-s. Leslie Stiles, a member of the purfesh in
England, burnt herself to death the other week by
the old glove-cleaning process. She had put on a
long pair of gloves to clean them with petrol, and
was holding them near a gas-jet to dry when they
burst into flames. Also a celluloid bracelet on her
arm assisted to spread the conflagration. The domes-
tic g’ove-cleaning risk is near akin to the foolishness
of striking a light to discover an escape of gas.
M. P. Adams, who is taking “Ireland To-Day”
through Queensland, writes of picture-shows and
things in the North. “Astonishing to see how wide-
spreading and well-developed the picture biz is.
This town of Ayr (where I scored a £52 house
last night) is 50 miles from Townsville and on a
railwav that crawls you along at 12 miles an hour,
and the stopping places are really cane sidings. One
stop is marked (in good White Australian) Ching
Do, after a well-to-do Chow in the vicinity. Yet
Ayr supports two picture theatres. The one I
showed at seats about 1000. The Circle has
180 tip-backed seats and there’s a sliding roof. Ex-
cept that it takes longer to get the star films, which
have had the running in the big centres before they
arrive here, the folks are as well catered for as the
city and suburban crowds.... There are numbers of
new chums on the canefields, and I guess that if
it’s not a white man’s game to cut cane this glorious
weather no work is suitable for white men.”
“Ike Pagliacci”: The Bulletin advocates the in-
troduction of the revue, but, given that any Austra-
lian revue well written, well .produced and well acted
would be a big artistic success, I doubt seriously
whether it would be a payable proposition for the
manager. Oscar Asche maintains that Australian
audiences prefer the obvious to the fantastic, and
they proved he was right by their treatment of
“Peter Pan” and “The Blue Bird.” It isn’t the
resident Londoner who gives the revue the success
claimed for it in the Big Smoke, but rather the
visitor, for the Empire and Alhambra are swarmed
by oversea men just as the Folies Bergeres and
Moulin Rouge (left alone by Parisians to
a great extent) are in Paris. I have heard
big laughs got at English revues with dia-
logue that I am dead sure would be either mean-
nig] ess or distasteful to the average Englishman. In
“Everybody’s Doing It,” at the Empire, the ghost
of Drake is talking with Gaby Deslys. Drake has
returned to earth to object to his treatment at the
hands of Beerbohm Tree. At the back of the stage
is a bedroom, distinctly feminine, with a double bed
well in view. Gaby incites Drake to dance the
merry glide with her after he has told her that
whenever he hears the war drums they call him to
the assistance of Old England. Drake partially and
Gaby very much disrobes, the glide begins, and the
lady invites the ghost into the bedroom. He is
going when the war drums sound. “ ’Tis the war-
drums’ rumble which summons Drake to the assist-
ance of Old England,” says the ghost of the mariner,
pausing on the threshold. “And are you going?”
from Gaby, imploringly. “Not this time,” cries
Drake, and dashes into the bedroom. Quick black-
out. To the average Englishman neither Beerbohm
Tree nor England’s Glory is a joke, and I feel that
the heartiest laughers at this scene weren’t English-
men. Several London papers criticising the Alham-
bra revue, “Kill that Ely,” condemned the authors
for being “too personal.”
Tittell-Brune and “Ivanhoe” get faint praise from
London Sketch. The producers “have laid them-
selves out to surpass all previous efforts in crowds
and color and noise; and they have succeeded, more
particularly in respect of noise. ... consequently,
tliere is not much room for acting. Miss Tittell-
Brune is most furiously impassioned as Rebecca. . . .
and the aim of everybody else is to be very bluff
and very strident indeed.”
Rose Edouin, better remembered in Melbourne and
elsewhere as the Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis of a genera-
tion and a half ago, has made a hit in “Romeo and
Juliet,” with Beerbohm Tree, at His Majesty’s. This
is how J. T. Grein, a leading London dramatic critic,
puts it: “There was one other impersonation that
calls for special comment and praise; it was the
Nurse of Miss Rose Edouin, low comedy if you like,
but comedy as Shakspeare must have intended it —
a dear old soul with an eye to the main chance and
the innate inclinations of a good-natured go-between.
Not since the days of the famous Mrs. Stirling have
we enjoyed a Nurse so natural and so humorous.”
“Harrison O.” : “Joseph and his Brethren,” the title
of the Biblical play which Beerbohm Tree has got past
the British censor, is a steal. Charles Wells, who
was a cobber of Keats’s, wrote a long dramatic poem
and called it “Joseph and his Brethren” early in the
18th century. This poem, although distressingly ver-
bose, is full of fine lines, and contains a couple of
great scenes. The temptation of Joe, by Mrs. Poti-
phar is handled in a style that makes the bald narra-
tive of the Scriptures read like an iceberg. Her
name, by the way, was Pharaxanor in Wells’s story.
“Ike Pagliacci”: The International Artists’ Lodge,
with its chief fireplace at Berlin, keeps a parental
eye on the interests of German vaudeville perform-
ers. The secretary, Max Knorah, is the only man I
ever met who could write a letter, carry on a con-
versation, and attend to a telephone message at the
one time, using a different language in each job.
He was the originator of the “mind-reading” act
introduced here by the Howard Bros. He astonished
vaudeville managers with a “writing dog,” and with
his brother he produced a mystery act in which an
inky ball wandered aimlessly over a suspended board
and wrote whatever was asked for by a whispering
audience. The “lodge” which he bosses has copies
of the contracts which various managers submit to
their artists, with particulars supplied by men who
have worked for those managers. Attached to Aus-
tralian managers’ contracts, f’rinstance, are par-
ticulars as to the cost of living in the Common-
wealth, usual length of stay in each city, and com-
ment, if necessary, on the manager’s liver. There
is a “warning to women” attached to certain South
American and Russian contracts, and the avarice of
the cabmen in Moscow is laid bare.
“Petramos”: Servais le Roy, who was in Australia
a few years ago with Rickards, has opened a mystery
factory in London. If you wish to propitiate your
nicest girl’s nastiest brother you can drop in and
buy him a disappearing duck egg or a vanishing
canary. (The point, of course, is to kiss the girl
while the boy is looking for the bird or the egg.)
Le Roy complained to this writer that he mostly got
his instructions from professionals this way: “The
girl is put in the cabinet, which is then covered
with a cloth, suspended in mid air, and set on fire.
As it burns a revolver is fired, when the girl is ob-
served sitting on the dress-circle railing. A slower
of Chinamen falls from beneath the cloth, and the
cabinet is discovered in the pocket of a fat man in
the stalls ’’ The inventor of the idea knows it will
look well, but the job is to make the thing prac-
ticable. Le Roy’s factory supplies not only the ap-
paratus for the" illusions, but all the scenery, and
even the printing for advertising purposes is turned
out on the premises. A young man can go into the
place a mere grocer’s assistant and come out feeling
like Aladdin’s uncle.
From a Maorilander who is helping to make Ameri-
can films: There are several companies operating here
(California), and they all have large ranches of
hundreds of acres, own their own live stock and
houses, and keep a company of cowboys and cow-
girls, working for them. These “Wild Westers’’ do
nothing else but act in pictures. In addition to
these, there are, of course, the film stars who take
the leading parts. Some of the cos. have wild-
animal farms—really regular working zoos, where
thev can take pictures of the heart of the alleged
African jungle. 1 am engaged at indoor work in the
studio in town. It is a large place like a factory,
and all the actual manufacturing of the film is
done in it. All the interiors are taken at the studio,
which has all sorts of scenery. Any conceivable plot
can be fitted at short notice from the stock stuff.
Personally, I think the American pictures are the
best of the lot. It is extraordinary the number of
mishaps that befall during the making of a picture.
in battle scenes, especially, there are often serious
accidents. And they ail help to make the success of
the film! I’ve seen as many as six or seven casual-
ties happen -fellows falling off their horses, and
breaking arms or legs, or getting shot at too close
range and badly scorched. Some unfortunates have
lost their eyesight in this gun-play. The big pic-
tures take from four to five weeks to put through,
and, as there are sometimes hundreds of people help-
x C ° st » I » Sn i ,l nfl ’ ng ’ 1 1, if • f f r
“Milestones,” at the London Royalty, is to stop on
reaching its 600th performance. This will be some-
time next month. Judging by the way it has started
and got into its stride, “Within the' Law” is going
to be a good second in the latter-day long-distance
ru n.
“0.K.”: Walter Howard, the successful hello-
Wh ° c ° nc °cted “The Midnight Wedding ’’
“The Prince and the Beggar Maid,’ ‘Her Love
Against the World,” etc., is now running those
audacious attractions around England at the two-
shows-a-night halls. As one who knows the game,
and has exact measurements of the quantity of ab-
surdity that can be crowded into a bello-drama plot,
Howard is worth listening to. Besides he is un-
consciously funny. “All my plays are military,” he
told a recent interviewer. “I was once a soldier
myself, so it is an atmosphere I really know....
This month I complete 130 weeks with my plays. I
opened with ‘The Lifeguardsman’ at the Middlesex,
where I went for two weeks and stayed ten. This
was the first play I did at the halls. Give the
people good drama twice nightly, played by a good,
sound company, and managers will not have much to
grumble about. I am of opinion that every drama
is better played twice nightly. That is my firm con-
viction. Drama that is to appeal to the people must
be swift, sharp and strong, and everything that is
essential can be. included in a twiee-mghtly prouuc-
t} on - ’ B m discussing his recent trip to Italy
that Walter Howard artlessly explains his prepara-
tions for rubbing local color into his amazing
stories. I spent a considerable time in looking at
convents and things with a view to getting the
correct atmosphere of continental convents for my
new play, The Rosary. The religious atmosphere
resulting from Howard s inquiries into convents
and things” will doubtless be so thick that you could
cut it with a knife. Think, of how his previous
plays have been perfumed with the aroma of Courts
and tinted with the true color of royal family life .
From London: Beerbohm Tree’s production of the
Biblical play, “Joseph and his Brethren,” at His
Majesty’s, on September 2, is going to be a more
elaborate affair than the drama by George Rignold
ami Rev. George Walters, seen some years ago in
Sydney and Melbourne There are no less than 58
speaking parts, and all the music is to be supplied

A LOT’S IN A NAME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When he was in America Lewis Waller was ex-
tremely annoyed to notice the colloquial, familiar
way in which the names of well-known Americans are
handled by the press. For example, he was fre-
quently referred to as “Lew Waller,” and that name
at the head of the bills certainly did not look dig-
nified. — Melb. paper.
A name is nothing to a man
Or woman of the common herd ;
To style one “Bill” or “Mary Ann”
Is not degrading or absurd ;
But to the splendid actor-bloke
A nickname is a painful joke.
He cannot brook a rude device
Distinguishing for humbler clay;
His name must look complete and nice
Upon the programme of the play ;
To dub him Jack or Dick or Ted
Soon leaves the god discredited.
So, take a warning, brother scribes,
Who make allusions to the pros. —
In all your puffs or diatribes
Do not descend on Waller’s toes.
And never dare to term him “Lew.”
It’s quite an awful thing to do —-
It hurts his ego adipose
And makes him one with me and you.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
tear of a simple and scientific device which restores
Hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and exp'lain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them Thev
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them—the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Bein»
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt”
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day But
of you can hear the faintest sound
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
cured, and you can be cured tnn v

A World Car.
There are R-C-H “Twenty-
fives ’ ’ operating in no less
than forty - five different
countries. This world-wide
popularity is due to the fact that
every E-C-H is giving excellent ser-
vice, and in strength, power, econ-
omy and roominess this big five-
passenger touring car is the stan-
dard of value the world over.
The R-C-H is, of all American cars,
most thoroughly adapted to the require-
ments of European owners. The R-C-H
is of 15.9 horse-power (English rating).
The R-C-H is the most economical car
to operate. It extracts every bit of
power out of every drop of petrol, using
less than any other car; drives from
twenty-five to thirty-two miles (forty to
fifty Km.) per gallon. This means a big
saving in fuel.
The R-C-H is left or right side drive,
as the road rules of your country may
require. You could not buy a more con-
venient, accessible car at any price. But
the value of the R-C-H does not stop at
that. It includes every bit of equipment
required by a motor-car owner. Read
the complete list in the column on the
right.
We advise you to see our selling repre-
sentative at once if you wish an early
delivery.

“Standing Order 81” makes a personal
explanation:—
Re a par. (B. 21/8/T3) concerning myself. The
statement that when N.S.W. Speaker Morton glanced
at a petition he said, “This is out of order—it is
typewritten!” is likely to cause loss of trade among
some of the nicest typists in the city. What the
Speaker did say was: “According to Standing Order
No. 81, ‘a petition must be in writing or type-
written, and no printed or lithographed petition
shall be received.’... .1 rule this petition out of
order. It is printed matter.” So the m%n who
wants to draw the attention of the House to the fact
that hanging is frequently fatal may pass his re-
marks to the abovementioned nicest typists before
presenting them, and I shall not object.
THE DISMAL
ALTERNATIVE.
Mr. Cook declared the Opposition’s censure of the
Government amounted to a censure of itself. Did it
not advise the Governor-General to send for Mr.
Cook ? —Brilliant argument in debate.
MRS. AUSTRALIA: “It was bad enough of
Fisher to behave in a way to deserve dis-
missal. But to leave me in the lurch like
this — well , I should think he would cen-
sure himself!!"
That splendid Munschausen or Pontop-
pidan, the cablegram, says that reefs show-
ing 70 per cent, of gold have been found in
the Belgian Congo. If that is so, Belgium
may say good-bye to its Congo. Britain’s
border in S. Africa ended at the Orange
River till the wonderful Diamond Fields
were discovered, and then the border shifted
in a hurry. Nobody in England cared much
for the Transvaal till the goldfields were
discovered, and then the British right to
the Transvaal rose up and stared everybody
in the face. No small State should ever
find a rich goldfield. Unless Belgium can
get a certificate that the field is all a lie, it
should hasten to amalgamate with France
on the best possible terms. Otherwise it
will probably be eaten on no terms at all.
Sydney is now reconciled to its small-
pox. Most people are just taking a scoring-
board interest in the scourge, and thousands
don’t bother to read the column or so of
“news” further than noting the daily record
of cases. A few hundred people get them-
selves vaccinated at the various depots when
the daily tally is a little higher than usual;
but the scratching process is so slo\> that one
medical man has suggested having pictures
of the patients screened at the various halls,
with the idea of thoroughly scaring the be-
holders, and driving them to the lymph-
depbts. While this scheme was being ad-
vanced, a stout Millions Club voice was
heard to remark that the trading community
of Sydney were losing £120,000 a day
through the epidemic—or the scare and
scatter causer by it. But where is
this scare that is taking over half
a million a week out of the mer-
chants’ tills? Are the outwardly calm
readers of morning papers really so fright-
ened that they dare not come to town to
spend money? If so, the pronosed exhibi-
tion of ugly, pock-marked pictures might
frighten half of them to death, and stun
commerce for months. Perhaps, though,
they are just short of money—like the thrift-
less_ llolman-McGowen Government. It is
an insidious disease, this smallpurse, and very
catching.
“Lex” tells about a friend: —
H. V. Jaques, who was chosen last week to
contest the safe Waver ley (N.S.W.) seat in the
Liberal interest, is the ideal Parliamentary candi-
date in many ways. Once let him, so to speak, sink
his fangs in the electorate, and he will never be dis-
lodged. Within six months he will be on speaking-
terms with about 90 per cent, of his constituents.
Before a year is out, most of them will be calling
him by his first name, and going to him, as a matter
of course, for counsel when there is trouble in con-
nection with the landlord or the dog license, or
what not. He is a barrister and a good platform
speaker., was Justice Barton’s associate for some
years, and is known intimately by more Australians
of every conceivable class, in Sydney, Melbourne,
Brisbane and elsewhere, than any other private citizen
of his age that the writer is acquainted with.
If the present N.S.W. State Government
doesn’t get out of its habit of turning the
first clod, or the fiyst sod, or the first fraud,
or whatever the thing may be called, there
will De trouble. Its favorite political three-
card trick is to go first-clodding on account
of a new railway, amid great local excite-
ment, and expense, and food and applause—
and then drop the whole question indefin-
itely for lack of sufficient loan money. Mean-
while, deluded cockies rush in and start
working little farms along the line of pro-
posed railway, and when no railway arrives
to carry away their produce they are partly
ruined and partly angry. So the Govern-
ment of Clodders loses friends.
Just before the N.S.W. Industrial Com-
mission rather suddenly shut up shop, a
Newcastle Labor official said he believed in
strikes (and lockouts presumably)—it was
best for the two parties to have it out.
Perhaps it is; but there’s a third party
that has got overlooked pretty often lately.
The Bulletin used to know two disrepu-
table old Chows who occupied rookeries in
Lower George-street, and howled bad lan-
guage and threats at one another across the
street. It might have been better if they
had been handed a gun each and told to
take pot shots at one another, only it would
have been infernally uncomfortable for the
crowds that passed up and down between
them. Likewise it’s a bit late in the day
for employees and employers, howling at
one another across the street, to think that
they’re the only people that count. The
crowd that passes up and down between
them, and is liable to get hurt when they
clash, is entitled to some consideration.
Either Gregory Wade, Liberal leader in
N.S.W., has his gleams of inspiration or he
knows where to buy a gleam now and then.
Minister Griffith has an amazing scheme
whereby the floating of £3,000,000 worth of
loans (with possibly more to follow) is to
be handed over to English Private Enter-
prise, and the same English Private Enter-
prise is to supervise, at 5 per cent, com-
mission, the building of the railways for
which the money is borrowed. The scheme
is subject to Parliamentary confirmation,
and if the State Labor party or the country
didn’t take kindly to it it might, under ordi-
nary conditions, have been left, ostensibly
through lack of time, among the Unfinished
Business along with the deficit and other
annoyances. But Wade crashed in like a
hasty elephant among a mass of scrub, with
a motion of censure to the effect that the
wretched agreement is “unsatisfactory.”
And now the Laborites have either to back
Griffith’s Private Enterprise device with
enthusiasm and with hardly time to collect
their thoughts, or else abandon the Holman
Ministry.
UNWORTHY OF CONSIDERATION.
It has long been a matter of common knowledge
that the Northern Territory contains a great deal of
highly productive country. There is, perhaps, no
more fertile land in the world that is to be found
in some of its fine river deltas. And the adaptability
of portions of the tableland out-back to pastoral
purposes has been practically demonstrated by the
successful working of some of the greatest cattle
stations in Australia. But the great bar to settle-
ment is the inaccessibility of most of the eligible
areas, and the Commission has already discovered
that this can only be removed by extensive railway
construction. —Sydney Telegraph.

SEDENTARY OCCUPATION.
"Poe Cook! Huh!! E'll find out.... E s
siftin' on the sword of Damocles, that's
wot 'e's doin'."
Thus Andrew Fisher, Federal ex-Prime
Minister: —
The present Government is trying to sandpaper the
sores of the toiling masses.
That is hardly worthy of Fisher. In Aus-
tralia every man and woman has a vote,
and one vote only, for both Federal Houses!
It seems a poor business to imply that the
peonle have made such bad use of their
power that they can be described as beggars
or lepers, like Lazarus. And in such a
healthy country as Australia is, the talk
about “sores” is uncalled for. The Com-
monwealth isn’t an ulcer.

“Hard Drinker” writes :
The S.A. Government is about to ask the electors
to decide whether the hotels in that State shall be
closed at six, seven, eight, nine, 10 or 11 o’clock.
The question is too serious to be settled in Parlia-
ment with Cold Tea and Mr. Bung both looking on.
But the publican and his friends are not to have an
opportunity to say whether or not the present closing
hour of 11 shall be extended to midnight or later,
so the “trade” has nothing to gain and everything
to lose by the plebiscite. The vote is to be of a
cumulative character. If there is not a majority for
six, then the votes for that hour will be counted
as in favor of seven, and so on, till a majority is
found in favor of some hour —which, of course, may
be 11, as at present. Beer and its votaries will vote
solid for 11, and Cold Tea will go baldheaded for
six. The more or less disinterested public will come
somewhere between these extremes.
The policy of .the Cook
Government seems to be
mostly one of sack. It pro-
poses to sack the kangaroo
off the postage stamp; to
sack the savings department
of the Commonwealth Bank,
and to sack Henry Chinn
from his job on the Wes-
tralian railway. Henry has
two difficulties to contend
with. First, his name is
Chinn. Second, some
friendly but ill-regulated
person recommended his ap-
pointment, not on the ground
of his engineering ability,
but because of his services to
the party at election time.
That kind of friendly per-
son requires a lot of living
down. Yet nobody can prevent friendly
asses recommending him on grounds that
give a handle to his enemies.
The transfer of a Collingwood pub-
license was granted the other day to the
widow of the Fitzroy commercial traveller
who had the bad habit of keeping large par-
cels of his employer’s oof under his mat-
tress, and was consequently butchered in
his bedroom by a couple of still-unknown
brigands. The bad lot whom the police
tried so hard to pot for the murder, on
finger-print evidence, was lately brought up
again—-on the score of having “no visible ’
this time—and allowed his freedom once
more on condition that he left considerable
foot-print evidence behind him.
PERMANENT AND REPRODUCTIVE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Griffith.... proceeded to express his plea-
sure. .. .“This,” he said, “is one step fur-
ther in that orgy of extravagance, of which
I am accused. It is perfectly true that
my department has spent more money than ever
before, but it is not extravagance. It is a sane and
wise expenditure of public funds, wherever it is
possible to extend the railway system, and transform
pine and mallee scrub into wheat fields and
irrigation areas.”.. . .In 1909-10 the net Rail-
way earnings were £4 11s. 7d. per cent,
upon the capital cost, and last year they
were reduced to £3 15s. 2d., a reduction of
16s. 5d., or 18 per cent., and,the growth of the
working charges has not yet been stayed. There
are further additions to be met in the current year.

I sing the permanent and reproductive works of our
country, camerados !
Is it not time to sing them?
Amazingly permanent, strikingly reproductive are
the works; magnificently payable are the rail-
ways and the tramways of Ma !
(Always provided you do not mind having the rates
and freights raised, camerados!)
The country must be made happy and prosperous,
and in what way better than with piles of per-
manent and reproductive works?
The people must be provided with all the permanent
and reproductive works that they ask for; other-
wise, what is the good of Being In Office?
Being In Office carries responsibilities; Being In
Office means spending moneys.
How can one better spend moneys than on the Per-
manent and Reproductive Works of Ma ?
Permanent means enduring, and Reproductive means
profitable; Being In Office is not, alas 1 endur-
ing, but it is exceedingly profitable if you know
how to Be In Office properly ;
(Or even improperly, camerados!)
Things must be arranged in their due order :
First, Be In Office; second, promise Permanent and
Reproductive Works ; third, Raise Loans :
In fact, Raise Loans anyhow, camerados — you won’t
have to meet them !
Loans are Life; without Loans you would find little
interest in Life:
Loans are Permanent; they endure, they remain,
they are faithful and consistent and reliable
creatures.
Loans are Reproductive; they are profitable, they
produce, they mean Good Things for Some Of
Us!
Blessed is he that Raiseth Loans, for he shall do
great works —Permanent and Reproductive
Works !
In the good seasons it is good to Raise Loans and
to do great Works, for behold! the dry season
cometh wherein no man can Raise Loans.
Being In Office in the good seasons enables one to
Raise Loans which might be needed in the bad
seasons ;
How shall the Other Fellow gnash his loanless teeth
in the dry season when the Loanspring is dried
up!
O daughter and grand-daughter of Jerusalem and
Lombardy, how welcome are thy Loans!
Give us Loans in our Time, O Lord !
If we Raise Loans at Four-and-a-half per Cent., yea!
and at Five per Cent., we shall show Permanent
and Reproductive Works earning Three-and-
three-quarters per Cent !
Can, then, the dry-season Loans Live?
Yea! at Five-per-Cent. the Permanent and Repro-
ductive Works shall flourish like the Green Bay
Tree when the dry season cometh !
Amazingly permanent, strikingly reproductive are
our Works and Railways built on a Five-per-
Cent. and run on a Three-and-three-quarters per
Cent, basis, camerados l
This is High Finance; this is Statesmanship ; this is
a Spirited Policy for the Elections.
Great is Griffith of the Go-easy ’Uns!
And I salute you, camerados.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Though the press agent boomed it not,
neither did the ringsider simmer with suppressed
excitement over it for a week beforehand, the fight
put up by Arthur Evernden, the Englishman, and
Frank Picato, the American Roman, on Saturday
night, was about the best ever seen in Sydney
Stadium. It was fast, clever and exciting. Some
of the men who have put up higher-priced scraps
in the past might have learned lessons in the art of
making war and popularity from these two unheralded
battlers. So cheerfully warlike and debonair were
they both that one could not help regretting there
could not be two winners. The personal contrast was
very vivid. Picato is a handsome boy with brown
skin, dark eyes and hair, and a melancholy expres-
sion. Evernden looked white as milk beside him;
he is more ruggedly built; his top covering is
indefinite; and his outstanding feature is a long
upper lip—always a sign of danger to the man oppo-
site. In most of the fights he has put up at the
Stadium, Picato has been the attacking force, and,
when repulsed or evaded, would sigh, glance sadly at
his opponent, and come back doggedly to the attack.
But on Saturday night he met as eager and aggressive
a fighter as himself, who rushed into the fray with
all the ardor of a youth of 20 making love. The
newcomer is a mighty hitter, and in the very first
round he got home a left and a right which sent
Picato to the boards for seven setonds. Almost
immediately he got up he was sent down again by
a terrific right swing. But he bounded to his feet
and attacked the Englishman so fiercely that Evern-
den gave way and smothered as he retreated, while
the house roared in excitement. When the gong
sounded both men had to think for a second to get
their chair bearings. The mighty wallops of Evern-
den during the next two rounds convinced Picato
that he would have to fight a defensive battle. He
did, and repelled attacks in quick succession, and,
then following up, he resumed the offensive. The way
both boys followed up the slightest advantage was
beautiful to see. Picato got a left hook home right
between Evernden’s eyes, and sent him to the floor
with a crash. It was a badly astonished floor. But
the dropped gladiator bounded up, and assumed the
offensive, and prevented Picato reaping any benefit
from his success. It was obvious that the English-
man was faster on his feet than the Roman, and a
much harder hitter. His blows were terrific, and
Italy staggered under the impact. But in the fifth
it was Evernden who staggered, and, like a whirl-
wind, Picato swept down on him, and bashed and
harried him across the ring. There the Englishman
blocked a series of knocks-out by adopting a sort of
Mehegan crouch and smother, till the gong gaye him
respite. The sixth saw Evernden, wonderfuly recov-
ered, rip through Picato’s defence again and again.
But Italy was game, and fought back desperately,
and succeeded in baulking a dozen wallops, till, in
his turn, the bell brought respite. Again the restful
minute worked a miracle, and Picato came out of
his corner and resumed the offensive. But the speed
had been too great, and the battery that Evernden
swung so lissomely was beginning to tell. The knees
of the Roman started to go, and he could no longer
avoid the savage and sustained attacks of the Briton,
who was avenging Caractacus, Boadicea and a few
others. But he was a generous avenger. He saw
a brave opponent was done beyond recovery, and he
stood off for a moment before the bell went, and, as
it did so, the towel soared through the light from
Picato’s corner. Evernden then for the first time in
the fight put his arms round Picato and kissed him
on the neck. The amazing feature of the fight, apart
from the speed and heavy hitting, was the absence
of clinching. Their arms got entangled a few times,
but not once did they hang on even for a second.
It was a wonderful fight, and the delighted audience,
when it had finished cheering the victor, gave Picato
an absolute ovation. And he had earned it. He
was always a graceful winner, but he was more
admired and popular in his hour of defeat than in any
of his triumphs. It was a fight that will be long
remembered. Macaulay might have written a lay
about it if he hadn’t happened to be dead.

Pal Brown, the American boxer who is to
meet Mehegan, next month, arrived in Sydney last
week. Baker being away in Adelaide, attending to
the opening of the latest Stadium of the circuit,
deputy Keesing assembled the boxing scribes at
Hill’s Caffi, and introduced the newcomer at the
usual dinner. Like most of the boxers imported by
Baker, Pal Brown, whose real moniker is Lawrence
D., looks like anything in the World rather than a
gladiator. He hails from a little town called Hib-
bing, in the wilds of Minnesota, a State on the
Canadian border. His account of how he came to
blossom into a professional fighter was the most inter-
esting storv yet told at these dinners, which have
become a pleasant side attraction to the boxing busi-
ness in Sydney.
* * * *
Saturday night’s disturbance at Sydney
Stadium should be full of interest, when Waldemar
Holberg, the Dane who put up such a splendid fight
against Mehegan, will clash with the Victorian cam-
paigner, Herbert McCoy. They are gritty warriors
who stand into their work. Although, presumably,
there is not much chance of such a happening, a con-
test between either McCoy or Holberg and Wells
would be an attractive spectacle. Both of them have,
in the writer’s opinion, a better chance of winning
from the finished Hebrew than Mehegan. If McCoy
should happen to beat Holberg, he is likely to be
matched against Mehegan some time in September.
It is a great pity that, if Holberg beats McCoy, he
should not have the opportunity of blowing the froth
off Wells’s pot of enthusiasm. But Wells is negoti-
ating for a raid on California for sometime in Jan-
uary, and will, if it comes off, have no time for such
engagements.

“Hermes”: It seems that the offence of
“White Slaving,” of which Johnson, the golden-
toothed fighter, was convicted in the United States
Federal Court, and sentenced to one year’s imprison-
ment in the Federal gaol at Fort Leavenworth, Kan-
sas, is not' on the list of misdemeanors for which he
can be extradited. Technically, his offence was con-
veying Belle Schroder from one State to another for
an immoral purpose. In France, Britain or Russia
there are no States, and as you can’t convey any-
body from that which isn’t to that which doesn’t
exist, the law has never been put in that form. In
Germany there are States, and in Germany he would
be liable to extradition, because its law is the same
as that of the United States on that subject. So it
can be guaranteed that Johnson will not go to Ger-
many. Allemagne has no charms for him. Still, he
is not a happy man. All civilised countries have
legal power to deport “undesirables.” And when
they do they always deport them to the land to
which they belong. So the sword of Damocles is
a trifle compared to this possibility which hangs
over the head of Johnson. To Damocles the sword
(if the hair parted) was supposed to mean sud-
den death, though the weapon would probably have
missed. Anyhow, after a man has passed 45, sudden
death loses 90 per cent, of its terrors —as long as it
is sudden. Damocles found this out, and got cheer-
fully drunk under the suspended blade, and died of
old age. In Johnson’s case, if the calamity falls it
means the cold, horrible jug—a month of which,
though he had a cell-mate and conversation, nearly
drove him mad. If he finds his way back to Fort
Leavenworth he will do a few years on his lonesome,
with the rat-house waiting for him at the end of
it.
When Johnson escaped to Canada his plea
to the Dominion Government was that he had
come to collect 22,000d015. owing to him in that city.
This money, needless to say, was a mere plant, cash
of his own that he had sent on before. To get free-
dom during the interregnum between his conviction
and the hearing of his appeal, the golden-mouthed
negro had been compelled to deposit 15,000d015. of
his own good cash. This gold he left behind him,
and it is in the United States to this day, estreated.
Having collected the 22,000d015. in Montreal, John-
son pleaded he had a through ticket to France, where
he had more money to collect, and would return to
the United States via Paris. The Canadian law re-
lating to undesirables does not apply to people who
have through tickets, provided they catch the first
steamer, and the first steamer in this case was going
to Liverpool. A hint that the Canadian authorities
would prefer his room to his society hurried John-
son on board the Liverpool steamer en route for gay
Paree. And so he got away. He still declares, with
his large negro tongue in his cheek, that he will be
back in the United States in September to prosecute
his appeal. But as he has been mdking great
endeavors to fix up six-month engagements with vari-
ous and several theatrical managers, it is dimly‘sus-
pected he is not on the square with the United States
Federal Law Department. One of the many lies he
unloaded into the pink ear of Canadian authority
was that he was going from Paris to St. Petersburg,
where he was to fight “Gunboat” Smith and Sam
Langford. Both these bruisers have since disclaimed
all knowledge of any engagements in the Russian
city.

The N.S.W. Rugby Leaguers at Brisbane
on Saturday got Queensland down and fell upon it
by 27 points to 12. It was a fairly decisive defeat,
but at the outset a lot of people thought it was go-
ing to end the other way. The day was perfect, a
5000 crowd was distinctly cordial, but for some
mysterious reason N.S.W. was nervous and played
with a grievous lack of combination. This gave the
Bananalanders a chance which they promptly availed
themselves of, and kicked up a score of 12 points to
six by half-time. But by this time the Cornstalk
backs had recovered their nerves and they gave a
startling taste of their quality at the jump. The
N.S.W. captain got hurt and play was suspended
while he was fixed up. But the job took longer than
was expected and the game proceeded. Suddenly,
with an exclamation, the captain broke away from
the ambulance man and charged a Queenslander who
was careering along with the ball under his arm.
Queensland had no possible hope in the second half.
It failed to add a single point while the invaders
lifted the score from six to 27. Which is good going.

Tbe Rugby League, having finished its
Sydney Metropolitan Competition, started on the
sudden death struggle for the City Cup. Both the
premier team and the runner-up were knocked out
in the very first round, Eastern Suburbs falling to
North Sydney (11 to 7), and Newtown being kicked
over the edge of the horizon by Glebe (6 to 5) : The
other dead ’uns are Balmain, wiped out by South
Sydney by 12 points to 10, and Western Suburbs, over-
thrown by Annandale by eight to five. This leaves
North and South Sydney, Glebe and Annandale in the
semi-final next Saturday. It would be great joy if this
cup went to the last-named, after its heavy weather
in the Metropolitan Premiership competitions. North
Sydney will oppose South, and Glebe will do its best
to wreck Annandale. The two that survive will play
off the following Saturday for the possession of the
utensil. The defeat of the premier club was the
surprise of the afternoon, especially at the feet of
North Sydney. But the truth of the matter would
appear to be that the premier team has played it-
self right out, and has, apparently, no new blood
sufficiently fermented to draw upon. The first spell
saw the Premiers dead slow and North Sydney none
too fast, but fast enough to score nine to the Pre-
miers’ nil. The second half saw East Sydney pull
itself together and start out to do things by making
ferocious attacks. But it was too late, the wild
hillmen from the north were too strong, and though
they played desperately the men of the East could
only make seven points. North not only prevented
its score being overtaken, but added two to it. The
downfall of Balmain appears to have been due mostly
to the loss of the reliable half-back, who had to
retire. Then South Sydney began to score rapidly
and added eight points within a few minutes of the
finish. Glebe’s victory over Newtown calls for no
particular remarks, except that it was so close as
to have been probably due to luck, or some other un-
toward influence. Annandale has got a fine back
machine now, and it will have something tough to
try its teeth upon when it meets Glebe next
Saturday.
The clubs composing the B section went on
struggling in an aimless sort of way. South Syd-
ney, with 14 points, was so far ahead of North Syd-
ney and Manly, with 10 points each, that pursuit
was hopeless, and the only thing left to fight for was
the position of runner-up in the second division,
which was hardly worth the exertion. Western
Suburbs, Balmain and St. George were practically
out of it, being single figures only. North Sydney
had to meet Western Suburbs, and Manly was up
against Balmain. North won by 19 points to 16, and
Manly did likewise by six points to three; so, as
South Sydney just managed to beat St. George by
six points to five, the three leading clubs moved up
a couple of points without changing their relative
positions. Altogether the end of the 1913 Rugby
Union season was a dreary fizzle.
The Rugby Union’s competition fizzled
out on Saturday last when Glebe and University
kicked off a sort of final for the position of runner
up. Eastern Suburbs did not play. Neither did
Newtown, which had no chance of securing second
place, and Eastern Suburbs, of course, had no chance
of being displaced even if it lost to any of them.
The struggle between Glebe and University was excit-
ing, both sides being very keen indeed. Uni. was
short of some of its paladins, and the result was
that it could not beat Glebe as expected, and, as
Glebe was ahead on Competition points, University
had to win to get second place. Glebe, by making
a drawn game with 21 points all, maintained its
billet.
The Soccer crowd was abroad on Satur-
day, and played matches all over the metropolis and
the hinterland adjacent thereunto; but the struggles
had no bearing on the destination of either cups or
premiership. That riot starts next Saturday, when
there should be something doing with great vehe-
mence.
In the Australian Rules Competition
Sydney, the holder of the title, had no difficulty in
retaining it against Paddington, which was soundly
walloped by 70 points to 42 Since 1903 Sydney has
held the premiership four times—in ’O5, ’O7, T 2,
and now T 3 ; North Shore (’O4 and ’O9), East Syd-
ney (’O3, ’ll), Y.M.C.A. (’OB, ’10), and Newtown
(in ’O6) have been the other holders.
* * * *
Some 20,000 hoofball followers packed
themselves into the Fitzroy (Vic.) ground on Satur-
day to watch the diversions of the ’Wood and ’Roy
teams, and were entertained by an unnecessarily
strenuous game, in the course of which nearly a
dozen players were temporarily outed. Playing
methodically and with great cleverness, considering
the, sloppy state of the ground, ’Wood held a moder-
ate lead up to half-time—32 points to ’Roy’s 21.
After that, it lost its punch, while the Maroons got
in a new supply of vigor and brains. The conse-
quence was that the scorer’s final remark was: ’Roy,
64 points; ’Wood, 37. It wasn’t a rough game, as
they go; but skill was replaced by misdirected
energy. The two other games that counted—Geelong-
Carlton and St. Kilda-Essendon—suffered from the
same complaint. The Saints ultimately downed ’Don
by 62 points to 50, and thus got into the semi-finals,
but on this play they have little hope of flying the
pennant. Up to three-quarter time Carlton had still
an outside chance of reaching “the four,” but in the
last quarter it tired palpably, and Geelong came
out on top by 69 points to 46. As matters sit, ’Roy
leads, and South, ’Wood and Saints follow in that
order, and the only possible alteration is in the
relative positions of South and ’Wood, who meet
next Saturday. Whichever wins must meet St. Kilda
in the semi-final. Melbourne outed Richmond by
64 points to 53, and South exercised itself lightly
by compiling 111 points to the Students’ 61. These
latter collide with Richmond this coming Saturday,
and are hereby urged to score a win somehow—so
as to remove the discreditable “duck” that stands
against them in the score sheet.
On Metropolitan Cricket Ground (Melb.)
Footscray and Essendon battled out the first Associa-
tion semi-final, to the joy and edification of 15,476
spectators, more or less. ’Scray played the keener
and more determined game, but its lamentable in-
ability to boot the ball in the right direction nearly
brought disaster. Continued want of success in this
direction ultimately got on the players’ nerves, and
the game became rough ; still it was brought to a
conclusion without actual hostilities. ’Scray annexed
seven goals 13 behinds, and ’Don eight goals five
behinds. ’Don therefore disappears from the scene
till April 25, 1914.

But talk about roughness ! On Thursday
two teams of all-wool amateurs —Scotch Col-
lege and Xavier College—collided on the
Metropolitan Ground before a “large crowd
of enthusiasts,” as the Argus put it. Xavier
had nothing to lose, but Scotch was unde-
feated, and this was its last game, so the episode
was willing. In the first quarter a hefty follower,
being pushed from behind, turned to expostulate, and
was handed a woodener on the point. His brother
ran up to apologise, or something, and was accom-
modated with another before he had time to open
his face. Then the umpire called a halt, and a
constable stepped out and explained that, though he
didn’t wish to spoil sport, he was supposed to arrest
someone when he saw an assault being committed.
The second quarter saw a repetition of these ring
tactics, another halt, and a further assurance by the
Law that the next youth who used his fists would
go to the lockup. After that, there was no open
warfare, but bumping, slinging and tripping took
the place of skilful play, the end of which came none
too soon, with Scotch 68 points, Xavier 40.
A different sort of game occurred on tbe
St. Kilda ground, where two Soccer teams,
styling themselves N.S.W. and Victoria, played
a return match. Ma, after her last week’s
walloping, used her head to more purpose,
whereby she scored a goal early in the
proceedings; but the effort seems to have used her
up completely, as she made no more, while the Cab-
bage Gardeners achieved one in the third quarter
from a penalty kick. So the disturbance ended in
a draw.
S. Aus. bas far more lacrosse players
than any other State in proportion to population.
(This is true, also, of churches, savings-bank accounts,
culture, Germans, vines and olives, stone, houses,
Labor Ministries, Methodists, “local preachers,”
literary societies, institutes, and other more or less
useful products.) The game has got a hold up-
country, and the Jamestown district gives the State
team a distinct help. Thus a good gate was
drawn to Adelaide Oval while the footballers were
away in Melbourne. S. Aus. rather hoped to beat
Vic., but not to get it down and jump on it. Yet
that is what happened; 16 goals to one is a record
rout, and not to be explained even by the usual
disabilities of away-from-home teams. S.A. has now
won 15 of these matches to Victoria’s six. One was
a tie.
Meanwhile, on the Jubilee Oval, there Was inter-
state hockey. Somehow, being given to lacrosse,
Adelaide has come to think that any hockey-player is
a man wasted, and that the game is one for girls.
The few enthusiasts, however, put up a good fight
with Victoria, and made a draw, two all. The game
was enlivened by a really sporting incident. Vic. hit
a winning goal. Nobody queried it. The referee thought
it all right. But the two Vic. men whowern
sible for it themselves pointed out that thp^!, oll '
failed to comply with a technicality, and rpf,!L> .
claim it. Some people will call this damSil°
others damfine. o °hsh,
The final of the lacrosse comnetifim
Saturday between Eastern Suburbs and Svdnev wa ° D
very stirring affair at which barrackers howled ?« a
demented fashion. The first half was one drawn 11 ?
deed of derring-do, a splendid contest of strength
sticks and wit, out of which Eastern Suburbs sero™
bled with four goals to Sydney’s three. But h/tH
second half either Eastern Suburbs improved marvel 6
lously or Sydney’s boiler was hopelessly burst as th
Eastern team piled on four goals to Sydney’s one and
collared the championship with a score of eight
goals to four. The way Sydney acquires the worst
of the luck is pathetic. This was its fifth attemnt
on the premiership final, and the fifth failure East
era Suburbs put up a wonderful record this season
having won 15 games, and drawn one, with never i
defeat to mar the symmetry of the whole.
Sydney baseball also ceased from troub
ling on Saturday, when everything depended unon
what Lane Cove could do with Mosman-North Svd
ney. As it turned out, the Cove was a mere bloke'
and could do nothing, the hyphenated team smiting
it right over the horizon by 22 to 11, and thereby
grabbing the premiership, the shield and other domes-
tic appliances. At the end. of the third innings the
Cove’s pitcher were apparently done, Mosman-North
Sydney leading by 14 to two. After that it was a
hopeless struggle. In the other disturbances, Peter-
sham found a shambles when it bumped Leichhardt
going down by 14 runs to three. University stag-
gered humanity and itself by outing Waverley—
four to a “blob.” Paddington smashed up Burwood
by 24 to nine; and so ended the most prosperous
baseball season Sydney has so far known.
After giving the “coach” idea a run of
three years, N.S.W. Cricket Association has definitely
turned down the proposition owing to lack of money
to keep it going. So stipendiary mentor Alick Ban-
nerman will roll up his swag, unless he stays on as
a matter of love. This is rather too cold a world
for an altruistic practice of that sort, however.
N.S.W. Cricket Association will be a
rather busy concern this season, as it has matches
with Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Tas-
mania and Maoriland scheduled, whilst “colts” and
country fixtures are also being contemplated if not
definitely arranged for. To give time for this heavy
programme the grade competitions will commence in
Sydney on September 29, but even then there will
not be too much time for the rolling programme to
gather moss. A factor which should assist the cricket
lords is the formation of an Umpires’ Association,
which will churn out a sufficiency of “white coats”
to meet the increased demand, and guarantee the
quality of the same.
James Paddon, the champion sculler of
Australia, has already commenced to train for his
match with Dick Arnst, which will take place on
the Parramatta River course on November 1. When
he met Felton he was content with about six weeks
of strenuous preparation, but he intends to have over
that period on the course itself for his meeting
with Arnst. The once mighty Dick will do the whole
of his preparation on the Parramatta. He, too, is
taking time by the forelock, and will commence work
this week.

The powers which govern motor racing
in France are hereby urged or admonished to
select a more distinctive name for one of the two
big car races of the year, instead of designating
them both “Grand Prix.” It was this duplication
which led to the recent apparently conflicting, but
actually accurate, cables giving names of the placed
cars. Of course, everybody knew that the informa-
tion issued by the Continental Tyre folk was authen-
tic, but many were not aware that there was more
than one “Grand Prix.” Those in the know would
probably win some drinks over the dispute, but
under the circumstances, all bets should be declared
off ' . . .
“0.K.”: What a clumsy, tedious enter-
tainment is a football match, and what a funereal
sport is cricket, as compared with hockey-on-the-ice!
There was a fine exhibition of the difficult game
at Melbourne Glassey Harem recently. N. S.
Wales met Victoria for a half-hour go on three
nights, but the local men won the first two battles
easily, so the third one didn’t matter. Play begins
with grace of movement, continues with pluck and
coolness, and ends in alertness and skill. As a
spectacle it has no dull moments. The umpire blows
his whistle not more than thrice in each half-time
(15 minutes), and the whistle means that he will
take up “puck” and pitch it down in the middle oi
the ice field, to be hockeyed as before. Players
fall occasionally, and are up again in an instant, as
though skates gave as sure a footing as running
shoes. A beautiful game, astonishing in the tact
that the “puck” strikers can so often get the nttie
thing into goal. A first glance at the game suggests
that the goal-keepers have a soft thing on, yet
goals are scored at the rate of one in every n
minutes, or oftener. The superior organisation
the Vic. team at Melb. Glassy Harem prevailed
against the other fellows. They were a lighter a
younger lot than the visitors. One of the two
of manager Reid is little more than a lad, and n
of them could manipulate “puck” so masterfully
Kendall, the tall, swift Canadian, who plays ior
N.S.W. But they worked better together, and tneu
victory was complete.


YOU NEED EXERCISES
SUITED TO YOUR PHYSIQUE.
To get beneficial results from exercise it’s neces-
sary that the movements conform, with your consti-
tution and physique.
Ready-made exercises may suit you, or they may
be merely expending your energy, and thus prove
harmful.
Judicious exercise is the finest stimulant it’s pos-
sible to give your system. It is Mother Nature’s
way of replacing waste tissue, nourishing the ner-
vous system, building up thews and sinews, im-
proving the blood, toning up all the important
internal organs.
It is the pleasant and correct way of sustaining
vim and vigorous health.
Judicious exercise is performing movements ex-
actly suited to your physique—the System upon
which the BAKER POSTAL COURSE OF HEALTH
CULTURE is based. Each pupil gets the exercise
he or she most needs —each pupil benefits quickly
and permanently as a result.
Here is evidence of what my course is accomplish-
ing every day:—
“My chest measurement has increased from 34
inches at start to 37i inches.
“My legs and arms are much larger. I have also
gained in weight to the extent of several pouncis,

A few words of Gossip on a Painful Sub-
ject:—
The Karoola small-pox contacts, recently quaran-
tined at Point Nepean station, just inside Port Phillip
Heads, filled in some of the dragging hours in a way
that has made the more nervous of them distinctly
thoughtful. To be brief, they spent the hours in
question in and around Victoria’s only leper station.
There are notice-boards about, which remark
“Danger. Leper Station,” and so on, but they are
dilapidated and almost illegible. There was once an
enclosing fence, but it has long since rotted away.
In any case, the Karoola contacts wouldn’t have
been deterred by notices—such was their boredom
with quarantine existence —for on learning of the
existence of the local leper they hastened to visit
him. Their custom was to stand about a dozen
yards away and discuss health matters and the like.
He is a friendly kind of leper, and, though one leg
is badly diseased, he still cherishes a hope of recovery,
being a born optimist. He is a white man, and is sup-
posed to have contracted the disease a decade ago
when acting as cook at the Stradbroke (Q.) Leper
Station. He is watched by an attendant, wearing
rubber gloves, and his meals are brought from the
Quarantine Station. What particularly interests the
Karoola contacts, however, is that some of them
strolled around the house, and the younger ones may
even have gone up to it, drunk the water or handled
contagious articles before they knew it was a leper
station. Now, leprosy takes a long, long while to
develop—from three to 15 years, so the doctors say
I—and1 —and when it does do so, that is the end—there
is no hope. So these people have some anxious years
before them.
By the way, the last leper at the station, also a
white man, didn’t die of leprosy—-but from an over-
dose of whisky. He was there in ’99, when the
Sierra Nevada came ashore. Among its general cargo
was a quantity of that which biteth like an adder
and stingeth like a bailiff, and a good deal of it
disappeared to parts unknown. Those who “acquired”
it were thoughtful souls, and most of them took
some to “cheer the poor old leper up.” In a fort-
night they had cheered him up into the cemetery.

“Melb”: Keast, M.L.A. for Dandenong, and expert
in farm produce, has been lecturing his constituents
and telling them that Victoria is either asleep or
dead. There are 50,245,700 acres in the State, and
only 5,109,489 cultivated. From private owners
519,077 acres have been resumed at the heavy cost of
£3,047,498, and on irrigation another £4,242,082
of Government money has been spent; yet, though the
holdings have increased from 64,651 in 1910-11 to
66,849 in 1911-12, the area under cultivation has
shrunk by nearly 300,000 acres. This process has
been going on for years. In 1903-4 the wheat yield
was 28,425,579 bushels. In 1911-12 it had sunk
to 20,891,877 bushels. Butter export in 1911 was
£4,637,000; in 1912 it was only £3,343,000. Den-
mark, less in size than Victoria’s Western District,
sent to England alone over £9.000,000 worth of but-
ter last year. Wake up! says Keast. Things are
too haphazard. Cull your herds, and increase the
milk yield. With us that yield is only between 300
and 400 gallons per cow, whereas in Denmark it is
somewhere between 600 and 700. If a cow did not
give a certain yield, it should be branded and sent
to the butcher. This should be a State job. And a
Supplementary State job should be the provision of
a fund whereby settlers could buy the best dairy
cows to replace the poor ones sent to the butcher.
Finally, he can see nothing for it but the enforced
cultivation of big estates. Another job for
State, of course. The number of jobs these a
Socialists can find for the State is amazing.
“Flinderino”: Now, Cooktown having been cleans
out, Rockhampton is to lose some of its bad
The steamer t ultaia is booked to call at Port Alma
this month (August) to load 1000 goats for “rl
ha ™ been b uying up all the available
lady billies for shipment; consequently the Central
Queensland goat-market is much steadier than for
years past. The local branch of the Waterside
Workers’ Union is discussing what pay its mem here
shall get for handling the stuff. Goats are notll
tioned in the agreement with the shipowners. Some
of the unionists reckon the bonedust rate should be
paid ; others say the shipment comes in under the
heading of mutton. But the majority think goat
should be classified as “Explosives and other dan
gtrous cargo.’’
“Chasuble”: While the consecrated warehouses of
St. James’s, Melbourne, are on the board, note how
largely a similar game has been practised by other
churches. Trinity Church, East Melbourne, has n U t
up over half a dozen tony residences on its land, and
has a sublime disdain of poverty. The Collins-street
Independent Church is rich in property and poor in
all things else. St. John's, Latrobe-street, is a heavy
concern, but it is buoyed up by its properties. So
with St. Luke’s, South Melbourne. Near by is the
Presbyterian Church. Long ago it pretty well starved
out litigious Rev. Ronald, the ex-legislator. Now
through propputy, its money-bags nearly burst. An-
other of the wise-as serpents is the North Melbourne
Wesleyan Church. After short-dieting its shepherds
for many years, someone said, “Good Lord! Let’s
put up houses on our land.” They did, and now are
purs Ay. All for the Cause, of course—all for the
Cause. Let unearned increment do what the “volun-
tary offering” won’t do. Besides, how much more
comfortable to let somebody else pay.
“Pick”: One or two statements made by “Coorey”
(B. 7/8/’l3), concerning the Northern N.S.W. Rivers
sleeper-cutters require explanation. If, as he asserts,
the inspectors of the Forestry Department stand off
30 or 40 yards when passing sleepers, and are, in
consequence, taken down any day in the week, how
do these inspectors themselves pass muster when the
sleepers examined by them, and stamped with their
mark, come before the Government expert, before
consignment for export, or selection for our own
State railways? Since the condemning of an over-
seas cargo of sleepers in 1905, or thereabouts, con-
cerning which the Forestry officials heard much to their
disadvantage, the sleeper-cutters have to resort to
much more devious tricks than those mentioned by
“Coorey” _ to dodge the inspectors. Covering the
timber with wet sawdust, to stain out the grain;
soaking in muddy, or salt, water; plugging—such
worn-out devices would not nowadays deceive a city
firewood hawker, much less an expert on the look-
out for counterfeits. I cannot answer for the
Northern Rivers inspectors, but I know that those
of the South Coast have the fault of being altogether
too strict in dealing with the timbers that come
before them, and, as a result, heaps of very fine
stuff may be seen decaying by every inlet from
which timbers are shipped.

“W.J.H.”: The proverbial good luck of the Chow
turned mongrel on him recently at Waipawa. A
local auctioneer had received a consignment of
bankrupt stock, and among the spectators
watching the removal of the goods from the
lorry to the saleroom was an ancient Chink
or Pong. As the last case was trucked in-
side, he hastily followed, and, pointing to a small-
sized package, he inquired, “How muchee?” “I
sell him to-morrow,” explained the auctioneer. “No
time to-mollow,” replied John; “me buy now.”
Eventually he secured the goods for £l6. Half an
hour later he reappeared, and so great was his emo-
tion that an internreter. a doctor and a policeman
were summoned. The interpreter solved the problem.
The case bore an inscription written in Chinese char-
acters stating it (the case) contained a false bot-
tom concealing £lOO worth of opium. But when
John bored in for the contraband he found another
label which read, “Better luck next time.” The
auctioneer made a big profit on the deal, but John
Chow has merely £1 worth of ladies’ underclothing
on his hands.
CHAINED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Is mine till death this shabby street
Where old-faced gutter-children play,
And men come home to sleep and eat
’Twixt grimy day and grimy day,
Where slattern women clack and gape,
Where flaunting youths of either sex
With tawdry gauds new fashions ape,
Where shuffle past unsightly wrecks?
There is much writing on the walls,
Obscenities and infant wit,
Mid warping wood, and plaster-falls.
My soul is wholly sick of it.
The stifling roofs of rusty tin;
The ugly yard, unkempt and mean,
That gathers filth and garbage in,
And by no chance is ever clean;
The asphalt cracked ; the corner stores
Where goods are fouled by flies and dust;
The drinking-dens with dirty floors—
Grim haunts of sordid life and lust.
Once I had dreamed of better things
Outside of this, a sweeter clime
Of scented fields and whirring wings—
A wider view, a statelier time.
Shall it for ever be that some
Must harbor in the noisome place,
Chained to the cheap and fetid slum —
The Ishmael-children of the race?
Well! Send the jug for beer again—
The oyster-barrow’s trundling past.
Let’s face the world like drunken men.
Thank God, it cannot always lastl
Though all inept, and chained, and mean,
We’ll curse the world, that gave us breath,
Through bouts of drink and sleep between;
It cannot cheat us out of death 1
You may not tag a moral here;
There is no scope for praise or blame,
Nor any tale to urge the tear —
Only shame’s concept of its shame.

' “Suburbanite” : Having spent several mis-
I guided years as assistant in a shop, I know
| just what sort of H —l it is when things are
dull, and there is nothing to do but dust
and fold, and dust again, while you are
waiting for the customer that cometh not.
A business house is worse than gaol when
the bosses are sore through lack of trade,
and the sack is suspended over the head of
everyone. Most bosses are very sore just
now, and, if the patrolling shopwalker had a
tail, he would lash it tigerishly as he padded
to and fro. Went into one of the big.shops
the other morning to get some lead soldiers
for the small boy at borne. A middle-aged
man was engaged tickling nine teddy bears
with a feather duster. He had his back to
me;- but 1 knew by the expression of his
ears that he had been at it for bourse and
expected to be at it for the rest of the in-
terminable day. He saw me coming in a
doll’s mirror and jumped convulsively to
serve me. But a younger and more agile
man who had been grooming a small ele-
phant jumped before him, and he had to
turn away heartbroken and resume the en-
tertainment of the bears. Also, a young
man who had been avoiding the shop-
walker’s eye behind a rampart of dolls and
; had leaped out from his ambush to secure
me, on seeing that I had been captured,
sorrowfully picked up a piece of waste
, paper, folded it on the counter and hurried
away with it as if carrying important
despatches affecting the concert of Europe.
When my lead soldiers and the tuppence
change had been delivered with a bow, I
said good-bye to the whole dreary estab-
lishment, and walked towards the door,
watched by countless shophands, the
bravest of whom were pretending out in the
open. The shopwalker, who had the dread-
ful job of supervising nothing and directing
furtive idleness until the blessed hour of
six should bring release, told me gravely
that business was slack “on account , of the
small-pox scare.” The criminally-reckless
Holman-McGowen Government should
hold a special private thanksgiving for the
opportune small-pox visitation- These un-
fortunate business people really seem to
think that the small-pox is responsible for
the slump. The poor ticklers of teddy bears
and folders of waste paper don’t seem to
know anything about loan-pox, or Cohenitis.
♦
From a hint dropped at the Melb. Tram
Co.’s annual meeting it is evident that the
prosperous concern has no intention of
retiring from business when the system re-
verts to the municipalities in June, 1916.
Its rolling stock, tools of trade, etc., will be
taken over at a valuation, but it will have
no further use for them, having evidently
decided to bog into the motor-’bus industry.
At any rate, Chairman of Directors Clapp
told an inquiring shareholder that they
“were not putting on any ’buses at present.
They were keeping in touch and getting
information wherever they were running,
and when it became necessary they would
have all the information and would be
prepared to act.” The councils which guar-
anteed the loans, to build the lines, and the
citizens who have, in effect, paid for them,
are apparently going to get little satisfac-
tion out of their property when they do get
possession of it. They will get back their
now-antiquated outfit, certainly; but along
with it they will get the competition of a
co. to which they have themselves sup-
plied the sinews of war.
“Kola” : The Age, of August 14, contained
a beautiful sample of the tactics of the
Cookoo Ministry in general, and of Willy
Kelly in particular. Says the report:—
Mr. Piggott asked the hon. Minister (Mr. W. H.
Kelly) : Is it a fact that the late Minister for Home
Affairs issued a circular marked “private and con-
fidential” authorising any returning officer to allow
an elector’s right to vote, even although another
person had previously voted in his name?
And Willy Kelly replied that, acting on
advice from the Attorney-General’s depart-
ment, the Chief Electoral Officer had done
the dreadful deed. The Age then printed
the incriminating document. The whole
business was boosted up to give the public
the notion that it was the work of O’Mal-
ley. Now, I have been a returning-officer
at every Federal election, and I have got
the blessed circular every time. It is a very
old friend indeed. It is just one of the
scores of routine notices that are sent out
each time: and Willy Kelly (if he be-
comes Minister for Home Affairs) will issue
it himself before the next elections. Appar-
ently it is to make some lep-al point safe;
arid the reason for its being, marked “private
and confidential” must be obvious to anybody
who isn’t deliberately blindfolding himself.
Does Piggott or Willy Kelly think it
would be preferable to issue a public notice
to this effect: “Tip for Fraudulent Voters:
If you turn up at a polling booth and vote
in someone else’s name, it won’t affect the
right of that someone else to vote.”
♦
“Red Tape, Jun.” : Information has been
given to N.S.W. Assembly concerning the
fees paid to members,of the Housing Board,
which looks after the Government suburban
area at Dace.vville. There are three mem-
bers —J. W. Holliman, T. H. Nesbitt, and
John Farrell. Holliman receives 30s.
per sitting and Nesbitt and Farrell 20s.
Now, J. W. Holliman is a Treasury official
receiving £lOOO a year, and what I want to
know is whether he attends to the Housing
Board’s business during Treasury working
hours, and, if so, why he should be paid
extra for doing so? If he attends to the
Housing job after he has concluded his regu-
lar Treasury job, what has happened to the
Public Service Board regulation which pro-
hibits a public officer salaried at over £4OO
a year being paid overtime? I remember
when the old Public Service Tender Board,
composed of departmental heads, was paid
at the rate of 50 plunks per head. Some-
body, as a protest, moved the reduction of
the Estimates by the amount involved and
carried it by a howling majority. Perhaps
somebody is going to spring such a mine on
the Housing Board people when their Esti-
mates transpire. May he blow a hole in them
as big as a bullock.

The Best Saddle in Australia
for the Stockman
We have been making saddles for close on half a century—and
air >ve know about the game has gone into the making of this
famous Stock Saddle of ours. It is hand-made throughout—no
cheap and nasty machine work anywhere. It is built on the
staunchest tree of specially tempered steel, fitted with an
unbreakable ghßetplate, to which are riveted (not screwed, mind
you) solid steeH.hind crupper plates. This makes the tree
absolutely unbreakable, yet gives just the elasticity and “give”
needed. The seat is made, of specially tanned bag leather, with
very long, thick harness leather, flaps, that do away with the
need of wearing leggings. There are leather' ppipts to the panel, that will
not wear out for the whole life of the saddle. The knee pads are* 5j inches
high, and made of solid leather, double sewn inside's£> that they wofi’t sag
or give over. The thigh pads are made in the same way and 1} inches
high. We have the seats with as high a dish as 6 inches, but any lower
dish you want we can give you. The mountings gte brass and nickel, and
the Dees are fastened so securely that no tug will strain them. The panel
is serge lined, and with extended facings so as not to fray or wear out by
the nibbing of the swag or tucker gear. The saddle is sold fitted with
fold or split leather girths, 4 bar irons, stirrup leathers, ring or ordinary
crupper and surcingle.
OUR GUARANTEE.—Any number of these saddles of ours sold ten years
ago are in use to-day and practically as gbod as new. No stauncher saddle
could be made. The one you buy from us we will guarantee fbr two years.
If within that time the saddle proves fhulty in material or workmanship, if
you return it to us, we will give you a new saddle in place of it free of
charge. If a saddle lasts two years it will last as long as it is cared for
—though of course no saddle will stand being rolled on or being bumped
against a tree.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

IN BANANA LAND
According to Railway Minister Paget, the
Department has refused to accept delivery
of the five McKeen motor Carriages im-
ported from America; and now there’ll pro-
bably be a nice little row over the Customs
duty. For the Department is understood
to have parted up £9OOO to get the blessed
importations into the country, and appar-
ently the only security it has for the money
is a collection of vehicles that it won’t
touch on any account.
“Rangan”: Civilisation, or what passes
for civilisation, is bumping solidly against
one old-established institution of Western
Queensland. The wool carriers, chiefly
bullock cursers, are on strike because the
motor-lorry men do not belong to their
union; and the pastoralists are engaging all
the motor-lorries that they can persuade to
take on the job. The lorry is doing work
that the bullock cusser believed that nothing
else in the world but Poley and Strawberry
could do; and if things go much further
that way, Poley and Strawberry will be
pushed right off the track and out to the
nearest tinned-goods establishment.
“Rangan”: One Allen Short, of Towns-
ville, is making a bid for the blessings of a
worried Queenslander. He got tired of pay-
ing higher and still higher prices for inferior
oil and white lead for his paint, and set out
to look for his own. Taking the friendless
prickly-pear, he coaxed from it an oil which
he says he has proved to be superior to
boiled oil and white lead, and he proceeds
to demonstrate it publicly by painting his
half-dozen houses with it. The cost is about
one-quarter that of ordinary paint. If time
backs up Short’s judgment his health will
be drunk often and deep. Theoretically
prickly pear can produce fruit, cow-feed,
fertiliser, paint, and some kind of spirit
with which to drive motor-cars. Likewise,
you can get drunk on it. The trouble is
that the alleged possibilities of the dreadffil
Mexican porcupine aren’t sufficiently dragged
out of it. If the Government offered 100
per cent, bonus, payable for 10 years, on
any and every saleable article obtained from
the pear, people might discover enough sale-
able articles in the creature to exterminate
it. This would mean that the community
would pav half the cost of wiping out the
dashed old pincushion where it now has to
pay the whole cost.
“Kobbi,” from Rockhampton :
Central Queensland has lost two of its grand-
fathers. The first was Frank Humphreys, who
arrived on Earth in 1831, via Londonderry, Ireland.
He joined the navy and went through the battle of
Inkerman and other Crimean unpleasantnesses, then
took a wife, came to Queensland in ’6l, and defied
the deadly heat of Rockhampton for half a century
and a bit. The other was old William Conaghan,
who arrived in ’62 in the Eutopia—the first emi-
grant ship to come direct to Keppel Bay. He stayed
in and about Rockhampton for 50 years, and quitted
at 79. The tropical climate killed him, too. (P S. —
There were three degrees of frost this morning.)
Just retired from the Presbyterian kirk at
Rockhampton, Dr. Hay, a veteran of 84
years. Very long ago he left Scotland and
sought this country to escape an early
grave. Rockhampton in those days had the
most fearsome reputation in. Austral-
asia. and the Doctor decided to try
if the place was as bad as its name. After
47 years of splendid health the warrior
reckons that the deadliness of the climate
was probably exaggerated. In one sense,
however, he was deceived. When the Pres-
bytery at Auchterporridge, or Mucklebrose,
or whatever the place ffras named, bade him
farewell it told him to spread himself. It
said that some days he might hold morning

service at Rockhampton, and then drive into
Brisbane and preach in the afternoon. He
wasn’t to be narrow or parochial or limited.
For nearly 40 years the Doctor looked for a
horse that would cover the distance, but
never did he find the beast.
“Boswell”: The facts regarding T. J.
Ryan’s candidature in opposition to a Lab-
orite (Ryan is now State Labor leader)
are just these. In 1904 he stood as a demo-
cratic Protectionist for Capricornia. He
was a Deakinite, and at that time affable
Alfred had the Federal Labor party’s block
vote. Ryan was opposed by the Dry Dog
Freetraders with unusual virulence. Be-
tween them the Laborite slipped in. This,
wak Ryan’s only escapade outside the
pledged ranks of Labor. What then be-
comes of the insinuation of Kessell,
M.L.A.,. about his (Ryan’s) anxiety to join
the State rotters who masquerade as Lib-
erals?
A willy-willy swept into the Bananaland
Assembly one evening last week. Bouchard,
who has been quite dumb this session, offered
his first speech. It was during the time the
tellers were taking the record of a division.
“Time, time,” he shouted, quite malapropos.
Speaker Armstrong rebuked him, but the
member for South Brisbane looked defiant.
After the tellers had completed their work
the Speaker called on the member to with-
draw and apologise. “I decline,” he said.
The Speaker named him. Premier Denham
moved he be' suspended till the tea hour,
which was ten minutes off. On the House
dividing upon the question, it declared
against Denham and the Speaker. At least
three Government members, including a
Minister, left the chamber before the bar
could close them in. A more foolish-looking
House was surely never in existence. Bou-
chard returned to the chamber triumphant.
In Brisbane remarks are being made about
the silly-affair which are not printable.
The Changed Symbol.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The riotous semi-Bacchanalian revelry of the old
days has given way to seaside trips and picnics to
wattle hillsides and gullies. —Brisbane daily.
In our early days the Bottle in the bush-
land was supreme;
He was monarch of the merriment and
builder of the dream,
And the men who grimly grappled with the
forest till the gloam
Would make up from comrade Bottle what
they lacked of wife and home.
So the Bottle was a symbol—not a good one
I confess —
Of a festive, wild exuberance that ran to
mad excess;
Yes, the Bottle and the Throttle
In their intimate entwine
Were a sign of madding new life in this
budding Land of Thine.
Came a later generation who abjured the
Bottle-game,
And discovered there was beauty where the
wattles stood aflame
In their gold and silver splendors, while the
gullies filled the air
With a subtle wine-like perfume that was
magical and rare;
And in time to Bacchanalians who could
only find a joy
In the clipping of the Bottle, like a damsel
young and coy
Came the Wattle, pushed the Bottle
From the intimate entwine,
And became a lovely symbol of this laughing
Land of Thine.
And to-day the merry maidens as they troop
along the road
On a joyous jaunt engaging strip the
branches of their load,
And with song and lilt and laughter twine
their tresses in the spray,
And are Peris and Princesses as they dance
along the way;
When the very air is fragrant shall they not
be fragrant too?
If the trees are robed in amber shall not
girlhood have its due?
So the Wattle clips the Throttle
With a loving-sweet entwine,
As a token fair of futures in this budding
Land of Thine.
QUEENSLAND.

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, August 23, 1913.
My Deab Thakgomindah, —
Governor Macgregor’s engagements this
week have included- such frivolities as the
annual meetings of the Charity Organisa-
tion Society, the Blind Institution and the
University Senate. This afternoon he went
to Auchenflower and presented the trophies
won at the tennis tournament. He gets a
mere £3OOO a year and expenses for this
sort of mortal struggle.
It has been a week exhilarated by several
assemblies of the Fashionable and the Noi-
so-Fashionable to leap in couples what time
the pianist beats the time and the trombone
beats the band. On Tuesday evening the
James Clarks elaborated their verandahs
and invited some dozens of friends (enemies
were rigidly excluded by the gardener with
a hoe at the front gate) to test the special
tallow on the ballroom. All of which was
in honor of Miss Enid Burton, of Sydney,
who is sojourning with them. The family
had returned to its home at New Farm only
the day before, so the tallowing was some-
what hurried. During Show week it (the
family, not the tallow) lived at Lennon’s
Hotel, in order to be nearer the conglomera-
tion of farm and station adjuncts.
Same night the Roger Hartigans got dili-
gent. They also used flags and tallow in
the conspiracy, and about 50 people pranced
till supper time. After stoking up they
pranced some more.
On Wednesday Mr. and Mrs. W. Craig
hired the top room at the Cafd Majestic,
loaded it with a band, and induced a large
party to cavort in honor of their silver wed-
ding. About 100 cavorters undertook the job
in full war paint. (Just here, we’ll sit out
a dance or two.)
Died this week R. M. Collins, M.L.C., of
Tamrookum, one of the oldest squatters on
the Logan. There were three brothers in
the family, all noted for their generosity
and hospitality. George and William have
been dead for some years, and the only ani-
mate representative of the original family
is now Miss Jane Collins, a grey-haired
lady with a delightful personality. R. M.
had, I believe, nine children, all married
except one. Mrs. Douglas Harris is the
most recent bride. The unspliced sister is
to marry a soldier boy named Llos'd some
time next year.
On Wednesday afternoon Mrs. James
Clark gave an At Home at YVybenia, on the
New Farm bank of the river. Mrs. Ralph
Clifton served out rations at Cafe Eschen-
hagen on Tuesday, in honor of Mrs. Cro-
thers, who spent a week or two in Brisbane,
and has now gone back to her home at St.
George. Also, Mrs. Bousfield had a lun-
cheon party to the same place on the iden-
tical day.
On Tuesday afternoon the hospitable
doors of the Hicks mansion on the River-
road were flung wide to cope with the rush
of girl anxious to see daughter Gladys after
her long holidav in Canada and the United
States. Lena Hammond and Betty Cock-
burn uplifted musical voices, and Gladys
Frost tamed the piano where it stood. Mrs.
Hicks wore a white lace and black ninon
gown, and daughters Gladys and Beatrice
kept up the family reputation for smart-
ness—smartness in skirts and things that
really count in these days of illustrated
Society.
Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Cecil Palmer
gave a competition afternoon, .in honor of
Miss Gould, of Sydney, who is staying with
her. She might have given an elephant
afternoon or a blandiloquence evening, but
they had run out of them at the tinsmith’s,
so_ she had to take what there was. The
thing was decorated with sweet peas, roses,
violets and double stock. Ella Sydney Jones
won it, and Madge Cullen and Grace Bell
tied for the consolation prize attached to its
hind tail.
May Healion, who has been visiting the
South _ Seas, Sydney, and other piratical
localities, has returned to this city and
civilisation. The Harry Mills, after giving
a dinner for their horse Vixen, a first-nriy?
winner at the Show, have gone to Warn ■
the Cliftons have gone back to Oakey anri
other station people are fading over thp
skyline. e
Another party worried a bone and
with Mr. Millican, of Charters Towers whn
has been staying with E. D. and Mrs Miles
Almost all the guests were old Charters
Towersites, or else present Towersites on
the wing.
(On with the dance some more) The
Military Ball last. Monday was not nearlv
such a circumstance as other Military Balls
have been. The Governor, Lady Macgreeor
and the Vision arrived after the first dance
and were received under the lethal decora
tions by Colonel and Mrs. Goddard The
female togs that were whisked daring the
evening made a cheerful display.
Fourteen youthful female residents f o l
lowed the example of the 25 matrons, and
gave a ball on Thursday night. All’ the
prettiest girls were asked, as well as a good
sprinkling of popular young married couples
There was a reliable band, and the floor at
St. Andrew’s Hall, where the parties
bounced, is herewith highly commended.
Two Brisbane girls, Dorothy Brockwav
and Miss Caflisch, a daughter of that once
popular singing and music master, Bill
(Australese for William) Caflisch, have
started a dancing and calisthenics class and
are doing a profitable trade. These two'
energetic Australians gave a ball last nwht
which should add a little to their popularity
If more than a little is added the receptacle
where the article is kept will burst.
Customers of the Comic Opera Co. have
been grinding their expensive teeth since
the season opened at a party—always the
same criminals too —that arrives about 20
minutes late, and giggles and rustles and
bangs the chairs nearly off their hinges.
Loud and indignant “hushes” only seem to
amuse the noisy ones. At the first night
of “Autumn Manoeuvres” lots of people on
that side of the house changed their seats
rather than remain in the vicinity and be
mistaken for the same breed of cattle.
More amateur theatricals are to be thrust
on us. This time it is the University stu-
dents who are doing it, at least they will
be next Saturday night at the Centennial
Hall, when Robertson’s comedy “School”
is to be produced.
The Brisbane Women’s Club has changed
its home, and now is domiciled in the new
City Buildings, that used to be Finney’s
shop. On Thursday night Rev. Scott Flet-
cher lectured 100 women and two
men about Oxford. Mrs. Mansbridge, "whose
husband has something to do with work-
men’s tutorial classes in connection with
English universities, also made a few re-
marks at great length. The movement ap-
pears to be, Thargomindah, an attempt to
teach Shakspeare to female toilers who earn
less than ss. a week. Now. you can mark
your own betting ticket on the result.
The lawn players from your State have
been enjoying their trip. Last Sunday Mr.
Cupples, president of the Q.L.T.A., and his
popular wife gave a picnic in their honor
aboard the good ship Muriel Bell. On Thurs-
day night “Jik” Love, a former president
of the association, did his share of the en-
tertaining. He gave a billiard evening at
the Brisbane Club.
And I subscribe myself, in consideration
of the influenza plague which is upon us,
Yours gloomily,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
The British Parliamentary party will gain
a fine idea of the capabilities of this conti-
nent if it “does” Australia as it is going to
do Queensland. It proposes to reach Bris-
bane on Saturday afternoon and to leave in
three sections on the following Monday.
Tuesday and Wednesday. The area of
Queensland is 668.000 square miles; its
products vary from those of temperate to
those of tropical latitudes. Verily, travel is
a great educator.

by, the -e-building of their wheels, cannot do better than fit CONTINENTAL “OVERSIZE” TYRES. The many advantages

H. Kozminski (Adelaide) : If you will
read that article again you will see that the fact of
the managing director of The Bulletin being a
shareholder in the Wireless Co. alluded to was taken
for granted. There wasn't the faintest intention of
denying it. Also, he is a shareholder in some other
things. The ex-editor is a shareholder in a few
things, also.- The present editor was, till lately, a
shareholder *in • the Insurance Office of Australia, but
had to sell out to meet the lasses on a luckless specu-
lation. Likewise he owns a dead mine in Maoriland,
and a fairly large insurance policy. His wife and
eldest daughter have a small interest in the Aus-
tralian Bank of Commerce. His son has a few
pounds in the savings bank, and a farm. The
associate editor is suspected of owning a house and
some newspaper shares. His eldest son is also farm-
ing. But, tell us, Kozminski of Adelaide, do you
mean to imply that unless a man buries his savings
in the backyard, he can't be honest ? Frazer’s atti-
tude apparently was that, because he hadn’t bought
a certain patent, and because the managing director
of The Bulletin had some shares in the co. which
owned that patent, therefore this paper must for
all time declare Frazer to be a perfect and heaven-
born Minister? Well, he isn’t anything of the sort.
Nor is King O’Malley. And the King, in his most joy-
ous moments, hasn't alleged that this paper scoffed
at his big hat because it owned a hat factory. It
has no interest in any hat factory W. A. Ritchie:
These aboriginal names make us tired. Take a
great, featureless plain, say 200 miles one way and
200 miles the other, with a black, unlettered race
wandering over it in search of ’possum. Later, the
white man builds a railway, and somewhere he finds
water 1000 ft. below the surface. Then somebody
asks the first blackfellow he meets what was the
native name of the place. There was no native name
because there was no blessed old place. You might
as well ask a fish what was the fish name for a
square yard of water in the middle of the Pacific.
The native says “Gibbit it rum,” and the locality is
consequently called “Girilambone.”.. . .E.C.: The
cost of inspection is half a crown. Impossible to
say how much the copying would cost. It would
depend on whether a friend or a lawyer did the
job O. Riginal: Very faint writing on blue paper
to hand, and possibly what you say is
quite correct. If you’ll write it plainly an
white paper we’ll be happy to pass on
opinion J. Parr: Well, we’ll say it again—if
the wheat-growing industry cannot afford to pay
decent wages, it is no good to Australia. But this
paper believes it can afford to pay decent wages.
At one time it wasn’t thought possible that it could
provide the boss with a motor-car; yet it does, in
hundreds of instances. Better wages and conditions
will produce better workmen: —and more intelligence.
And more intelligence is what the farming business
fairly shrieked for for years —and it hasn’t got
enough of it even now....Le Stolto: Quite right;
Bath, of the Quinlans, conducted the No. 5 Tchai-
kowski symphony, wrongly referred to at the time
as the “Pathfitique,” and not the No. 6, which is the
“PathGtique.” T.H.J.: Don't remember it; but
quite likely it arrived. If it did arrive, it was
discarded; as another man’s description of a voting
machine was printed only a few months ag0....
Longshoreman: All right; we’U accept your assur-
ance that it wasn’t the late Rev. H. 11. Britten, but
his son, who was formerly head of the Bathurst
college. We wondered what had been keeping us
awake at nights.. Rob II.: Nothing in it but wasted
time.... Ripsaw: Planted it to see if the point of
the “Governor” story will sprout P. Hilbert: No
use for reprint verse.... Cyrus: Overthrown.... J.
Niven: Thanks ; but unsuitable for reproduction.....
C. O. Palmer; Particulars of Farmers’ £lOO prize
for Australian National Anthem were published, “Red
Page,” 14/8/’ 13. .. .Blazer: A few good grains in it;
but far too much chaff for Bulletin use. Winnow
it to one-fifth the bulk, and we’ll be glad to hear
from you again Hock: Too long and involved a
story.... Pete Max: Well, the writer, at all events,
doesn’t worry so much as you seem to do about
dying. What keeps him awake at night is the
thought of what a loss the world will suffer when he
dies. He is afraid it will never again be quite the
same w0r1d.... Gowoam: You’re right in asserting
that it is no coincidence. It’s a da —but there, let
us remember the law of libel and keep it wh011y...,
Bridget Finnigan: If that is your best, go on the
golf links, as you suggest. If your Australian stories
are better, let’s have a. look at them. .. .M. 8.: Cheer-
ful stuff, but a bit too rough for print Bellerive:
It is time to go up:—
A BALLOON TRAGEDY.
As a balloon sailed thro’ space
An aeronaut star
Attacked a student friend in
The swaying ear
While above the clouds the
Huge balloon sailed
A fearful struggle between
The aeronauts prevailed
You’ve robbed me hissed the assailant
Of the woman I love
And I’ll hurl you to eternity
By the saints above
Overpowered by the student
Was the aeronaut star
And hurled into space
From the swaying car.
Fred E. (Q.) : Sorry nothing suitable in the
batch C.V.H.: Expected something special after
all that growling. .. .Frank McM. (V.): “Atheist”
can’t compare with Other boy stories printed by B.
H.R.B.: “Skipper” only worth a par. As it
stands, it is merely a story in outline Richard
L.: Brief outbreak in verse silenced by basket....
J.W.G.: Dull and heavy... .Miss M. (M.L.) : Not
sufficient skill L.M.: “Surpassed” is a very poor
poem. .. .R.J.: “Study” can’t make the weight
Gom: Your poem, “Dark Passions and Sympathetic
Memories,” is too beautiful for print West Gunne-
dah: Dialogue declined Nellie E. D.: Sorry un-
suitable Nomad: The verses miss by a margin.
By the wav, you didn’t attach your name and ad-
dress. .i .Cowpox: Why did you try to rhyme “moon-
light” with “their sight”? H.J.K.: Some humor,
bjjrt Vit’s rather frail and shadowy... .Jack O’H.:
They’rjjf not for print, Jack... .M.M.: (O.) : Pretty
immature verse. Its proper setting is a children’s
page. Try anv of the weeklies that run a juvenile
section Mick M.: Feeble.. .L.N. (V.): “Feminine
Mind” not worth while Dreamer: A very young
poem. Criticism would wither it....R.N. (N.S.W.) :
Yes, try it again. .. .Jack Hardgraft: You say the
paddock was cut in three days, and the crop rea-
lised £5l 10s. and the expenses of cutting were
only £l5. But presumably your cocky only gets a
chance to make money at that rate off that paddock
once a year, and there are 362 other days in the
year. The way cocky puts it is that he makes
£5l 10s. a year out of that paddock, and £l5
of it vanishes in three days.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Rak: Joke about stuttering youth very poor.
Also it has been done too often, in one way and
another. Furthermore it is vulgar. As a side issue
you can’t draw a picture of a stutter, and far too
many drawings consist of three figures with an
intimation below that No. 1 is saying something to
No. 2 while No. 3 is listening. Incidentally we
don’t think you can draw. .. .A.E.R.: Any kind of
joke is capable of being illustrated in that fashion.
You draw a barber pausing in the middle of his
job of shaving an ancient citizen to listen while
another ancient citizen, presumably waiting
for a shave, reads the hilarious jest out of
a newspaper... .Norbie: Your “hum” joke requires
to be washed, also boiled and fumigated... .W.G.;
Of no value whatsoever Fred G.: It nearly ar-
rived. Then it perished bv the wayside and fell
with a crash into obscurity.... Oildog: The artist
has been smitten with the reproach.

For the Country Horseman
The saddle here illustrated is expressly designed
for country use, for stock riding, etc., and is built
of the best materials throughout. If any of our
friends are requiring such a saddle they will find
this a genuine bargain.
r
It has a hogskin seat, a plated bar-tree, extra
long flaps, with points to buckle below. An economi-
cal feature is the skirt, which extends all round
and thus adds years of wear to the saddle by pro-
tecting- its interior from the weather. It has a
deep, “sweepy” seat, 4in. kneepads, nickel-plated
iron stirrups, and double buckle leather girth. The
price complete is £3/15/- Mention of The
Bulletin when ordering will ensure your having a
leather surcingle given in free, and the saddle will
be forwarded freight paid. It is to be obtained
from J, P, Talty, 388 Sussex Street, Sydney.

Never Got a Night’s Good Rest, Dry
Crust. Covered Head, Eyebrows
and Ears, Also on Body, One
Cake Cuticura Soap and One Box
Cuticura Ointment Cured Him.
67, Colegrave Rd., Stratford New Town,
London, Eng.—“My baby bad dry eczema
from head to foot when four months old.
He used to scream all
day with it and never
got a night’s good rest.
It began on his scalp like
a dry crust, and each
time he was washed the
scales came off and it
ran, wept, and spread.
In this way it covered
his head, eyebrows, and
ears, also in places on his
body, so that really from top to toe he was
one mass of eczema and neighbours used to
say what a terrible sight he looked, espe-
cially with his head uncovered. My baby
was a perfect sight with the complaint.
They told me it was dry eczema and to
rub him with carron oil night and morn-
ing. This I did for about two months all to
no use. I saw the advertisement for Cuti-
cura Soap and Ointment and offer of free
samples which I wrote for and used. They
began to mend baby, and I then bought a
cake of Cuticura Soap and a box of Cuticura
Ointment. One cake of Cuticura Soap and
one box of Cuticura Ointment cured him.
He is now quite clear.” (Signed) Mrs. Pugh,
Nov. 14, ’ll.
A lifetime of disfigurement and suffering
may be averted by the use of Cuticura Soap
and Ointment in childhood. Sold throughout
the world. Liberal sample of each, with 32-p.

RENOLD DRIVING CHAINS
The Modern Method of Power Transmission.
Think of saving 26 per cent, in power by adopting the Chain Drive instead of
the leather belt. Yet this has been accomplished and proven by exhaustive
tests carried out on an Automatic Lathe.
Realise what this saving of 26 per cent, in power means: —
26 per cent, less current has to be paid for every year.
The power plant can be 26 per cent, smaller and still show a larger
production than when belts are used.
But this is only one superior feature of the Chain Drive.
It has been proved that Chain-Driven Machines produce 20 per cent, more
work, and do the work better.
Furthermore, THE CHAIN NEVER SLIPS; it lasts longer and causes less
wear and tear on the Machines.
It will pay every factory owner to investigate the Renold Chain Drive. Test
it how you will, you cannot get away from the fact that it is superior in almost
every detail to any other form of power transmission.
We have an interesting Book which puts the whole question clearly and shows
many convincing proofs. Ask us for a copy.

* * * *
Jimmie Pannikin”: Frank Hartley, journalist,
business man and excellent ex-outbacker, has taken
?xr e airx mana £ em ent of the Northern Champion
(A.S.W.), so things in Tory Taree will soon hum.
ibis is not Hartley’s first experience of Cowland.
lie was, for a triumphant time, editor of the Wing-
ham Chronicle, which he made into the most
sought-for paper of what folk call the southern North
Coast. I first met Hartley when he owned and
edited the bright Opal Miner; and battled hard to
show the democraey-o’-the-desert the straight, sane
path of progress. One could tell some striking sand-
and-saltbush stories of Hartley’s efforts in Opal-
ville, but for the present we’ll simply say that the
Country Party in Cowland could not have made a
happier choice of a managing editor.
“0.K.”: The Era, the oldest and stodgiest of Eng-
lish theatrical papers, has fallen from the lofty
superiority of sixpence to the popular vulgarity of
one penny. For 75 years the Era was published as
a Saturday sixpenny. Last year, when the poor old
thing’s circulation was falling fast, the proprietors
issued a Wednesday Era at a penny. Now the soul
of the cheap edition has passed into the dead body
of the ancient theatrical advertising medium, and the
Era is born again on Wednesdays only, at a cost,
charge or remuneration of one honest brown.
* * * *
“G.R.N.”: One would expect the ancient Sydney
printery in Hunter-street to be af least correct in its
references to ancient Sydney history; but it isn’t.
The other day it furnished a picture of Harrington
Park, Camden, and explained that, in Macquarie’s
time, a vessel called the Harrington entered Port
Jackson bearing letters of marque, that Campbell
(the commander) was hospitably received by the Gov-
ernor, and that, while he was dining at Government
House, his vessel was seized by convicts, who sailed
away and were never heard of again. The facts are
that the Harrington arrived in 'Sydney on March 31,
1808, with merchandise from China, and on May 16
following was seized by a band df some 40 convicts,
who got away. The ship and 20 of the convict
crew were, however, recaptured in 1809, by H.M.S.
Phoenix, at Suconia, in the Philippine Islands. This
all happened while Major Johnston was in his
usurped office after Bligh’s arrest, and long before
Macquarie was appointed. The Harrington was a
vessel with a history. At one time, sailing under
letters of marque on the coast of Peru, it captured
the Spanish cruiser Estramina and a merchantman,
and brought them to Sydney on March 6, 1805.
Governor King at once seized the Harrington and its
prizes and charged Captain Campbell with piracy.
The question was referred to the British Law officers,
who exonerated the captain and ordered the release
of the ships. The prizes were then sold by auction
in Sydney, and realised £5053. With his share
Campbell got a start in “colonial” life—hence the
name Harrington Park.
“The Immature Male” : The authors in the Anglo-
Australian literary field toil not in digging out their
facts, neither do they spin their yarns with the
slightest degree of verisimilitude. An instance
thereof is ope Burton K. Henderson, a Bullopolis
scribe, who recently perpetrated a novel dealing with
Out-back Australia. Burton had evidently gathered
his ideas of the subject from the wilds of Brixton
and the wastes of Shepherd’s Bush, for he portrays
Binghi as a banjo-twanging darky who cherishes a
partiality for melons, addresses his boss as “Massa,”
and is liable to break into a buck-and-wing dance
on the slightest provocation. Furthermore, Burton
is not satisfied with having a “sheep-ranch” run by
a despotic “overseer” who is a cross between Simon
Legree and Buffalo Bill, but he strives to give an
eerie touch to the tripe by mentioning the “mournful
calling of the whallabys.” Probably he would also
have introduced the plaintive lowing of the mulgas,
or the distant bellowing of the kurraiongs, had he
known of those instruments in Australia’s bush or-
chestra. In the interests of the locally-born novel, the
time seems not too green for a Minister for Tripe,
whose duties would comprise the placing of a ban,
or a bomb —I don’t care which —on these puerilities.

“Eddyson” This is John Hop’s story of an Aus-
tralian poet. “Thim potes ain’t what they was, I’m

THE PATH TO GLORY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Crespv S o n a „vT ial 0f * the French poetess, Alice
a ge ? f ™ urd ering a priest named
the murder in n^ eSS + sta^ ed that accused committed
murder m order to boom her poems.—Coble.
I ve written verses now for years—-
The ballade and the roundelay,
Choice lyrics, wrought of poet’s tears,
Sweet villanelles, and pantoums gay—
But little have they won for me
In ruddy gold; for, it would seem,
Most meagre is the poet’s fee
In this commercial epoch. He
Is left, unrecognised, to dream,
If with no advertising scheme.
Advertisement the poet needs
Like he who urges you to wear
His rustless corsets, and who feeds
Imagination with a pair
Encompassing a sylph-like waist,
Depicted on a poster gav;
Or he who begs that you should taste
His whisky, or implores you haste
To buy a patent garden-spray.
My ad. I need, as much as they!
One solitary chance I see
To win the lucre that will buy
Warm wine, to glad the heart of me
And nourish inspiration high.
One way there is, one only way—
To guide a bishop towards the tomb;
Or else an alderman to slay !
(These advertising dodges pay!)
I 11 send a Gaud Mayor to his doom—
And then, hooray! my verse will boom!

That’s a plain, straightforward statement,
and the words mean exactly what they say
Gin Pills must cure your Back-
ache, Bladder, Kidney, or Urinary
Troubles, or we are obliged to re-
fund your money.
They must cure, or your money will
be cheerfully refunded.
You are to be the judge and jury.
Your word will be accepted
as final.
Your money will be re-
funded without quibble or
argument of any kind if
Gin Pills do not effect
a cure. Consider what this
method of doing business
means.
It means that we have posi-
tive knowledge of the cura-
tive properties of Gin
Pills.
It means that Gin Pills
will cure 99 cases of Back-
ache, Kidney, Bladder or
Urinary Troubles out of every
100.
We know that—know it positively.
It also means that we have a large
faith in the honesty of men and
women.
We do not believe that a single man
or woman out of one hundred who
have suffered the torments of
Backache, Kidney, Bladder or
Urinary Troubles would deny the
cure Gin Pills assure. 99
out of every 100 would joyously
admit it.
?SHELDOns
SMCLDOfIDRUCC,
This extraordinary offer is made
because of these facts :
The known medicinal properties of
Gin Pills and the honesty of
human nature.
Each Gin Pill contains all the con-
stituents of a pint of the finest gin com-
bined with other diuretics by
a new method and process,
and form a remedy which
effects cures in 99 cases out
of 100.
Gin Pills are put up in
glass bottles hermetically
sealed, and we/sell them to
you with the absolute guar-
antee that if they do not
cure you we will refund
your money.
They are sold in two size
bottles, at 1/6, or in larger
bottles, holding more than
double the quantity, at 2/6.
Buy a large bottle at 2/6, and give
them a fair test ; use two-thirds of
the bottle, and if you feel they are
not benefiting you, return your bottle
to the chemist or storekeeper from
■whom you purchased them, and he
will refund you the money, or com-
municate direct with the Sheldon
Drug Company, Ltd., 15 O’Connell
Street, Sydney.
Under these conditions is it not
worth while for any sufferer from

ary Troubles to at once test this new
remedy ?

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE drove our prows against the light
Of many a sunset’s spreading fire ;
We raised new stars as pale and
white
As lilies of a nun's desire.
We brushed the silver dawn apart
By shining continents untrod ;
We felt the mystic winds that start
Clean-winnowed from the robes of God.
We touched at many a purple port
Mast-thronged with silken-corded ships ;
On sailor-leave we held our sport
With winsome wine and scarlet lips.
We saw the singing lamps upflame
And jewel all the dazzled dusk,
Breathing a music of no name
That trembled sweets of rose and musk.
We saw the walls of temples hung
In lace of light from pillars hign,
Wrought by an artist’s hand that Hung
His dreams in stone against the sky.
We felt the awe of things divine
Where priestly voices chanted deep,
And all the dim air seemed to shine
With lustrous breath of gods asleep.
At morn we stirred our anchor chain.
And. gliding down a rosy sea,
We heard the salt airs smite again
A harp of wilder fantasy.
Upleaped the waves, outsprang the storm.
Wild hands clapped thunder through the
sky.
Draped in large clouds we saw a form
Tremendous as our doom go by.
The lightnings split the crashing world,
An arch ot flame the darkness spanned ;
Tossed as a leaf our ship was hurled
On gleaming shores of silver sand.
The tempest passed, the good sun la ugh' t
On blue lagoon and pux-ple palm.
The plumes of sea birds seemed to waft
A languid ecstasy of calm :
And through the tall, dark stems was seen
A wing&d palace of delight.
Against the pale sky lifting green
Its soaring peaks of malachite.
A sweep of song. The doors flew wide.
With silver armlets crashing free,
Each blushing as a happy bride,
Came forth a white-robed minstrelsy.
They led us in, they made us cheer :
Ripe laughter sped the happy day,
Till one lone star shone pale and clear
And warm night kissed the sun away.
The silken webs beneath our feet
Were woven with an opal fire,
And drowned in siren music sweet
We pressed the lips of red desire.
The envious moon with fingers white
Beat at the lattice windows wide;
The young sun came with merry light
And tossed a rose to every bride.
The clear day spake no word of wrong,
By night the kind stars burned above ;
Life rippled into happy song,
And every cadence died in love.
And did we stay seven wild, sweet years?
Time lived not on our shining isle;
Men build the almanac with tears ;
Our days, our weeks were all a smile.
But once upon the midnight deep
We heard a wailing far away,
A cry as of all souls that keep
Tryst with the ghosts that walk in grey ;
And once a wind of evening blew,
A sobbing as of worlds in pain
Oat of a wandering cloud to strew
Our path with hot, salt tears of rain ;
. And once we heard the clash of steel,
And once a trumpet shrilling death —-
Ob) J°y of life, that we should feel
That sudden catching of the breath !
eac h white love we begged a braid
i rJj , swee t remembrance from her hair ;
I Of drifted shreds of wreck we made
1 A high-beaked shallop frail and fair.
| Dear hearts, farewell! We go to win
| u Orowns that with crusted jewels burn,
I the keys' to let us in
" hen victor-weary we return !
' freeze that wandered round the world
Blew speed into our questing sail,
1 a s P mmer waters lightly curled
And broke before us lily pale.
Three days we ploughed a dimpled sea,
T- -Three nights we watched the soft stars die,
mil a land of witchery
■ Lrept up and purpled half the sky.
e saw the crested pine trees wave
va .Deys wide of tilth and corn.
? battled turrets flaunted brave
thousand banners to the morn.

The Tertium Quid.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A THUNDEROUS ground-swell was
pounding away outside, but the
lagoon was like glass, and the coco-
palms along the yellow r -white beach might
have been made of cast-iron, save for an
apparent spiral motion of the stems. Up
at the shallow end, where the gloomy man-
groves brooded, not a “mud-skipper” was to
be seen. The sportive fraternity were all
safe under water. The opposite shore
seemed as if you could cast a stone to it,
and the water-line was invisible. Dull
green foliage joined dull green reflection
without any apparent break. The sun-birds
flew screaming from tree to tree. The
sword-flies swarmed into the house, and the
little black geckoes, motionless on wall and
ceiling, took no notice of the feast thus pro-
vided. The vicious worrying of the flies
aforesaid at last made Mallardyke thrust
his writing aside and jump up with a
severely uncanonical exclamation.
Mallardyke was a lean man, and his mus-
cularity was ruggedly obvious through his
thin tussore garments. He was middle-
heighted and weighted, though hardly yet
middle-aged, and his brown, clean-shaven
countenance was the face of a man who
“had been through things.” He lit a cheroot
and strolled outside. Then, as his eye took
in the general outlook, he stiffened suddenly
like one who comes unexpectedly into the
presence of an old foe. “Let’s have a look
at the glass,” he said, and went inside
again. “Great Scott! —28.4 ! A solid inch
in about six hours! Something tremendous
on hand. Hope it comes away as usual
from south-east or thereabouts. Our hill
will save us a lot, in that case.” He walked
to the verandah-end and startled the curious
echoes of the place with a stentorian shout
of, “Jotan ! S’ali Jotan !”
An extraordinary figure made its appear-
ance from the “quarters.” Mallardyke’s fac-
totum was a ferocious looking old ruffian
who dated from the head-hunting
which high old times he openly and sin-
cerely regretted, notwithstanding that the
incidental happenings thereof had cost him
an eye, both ears, three fingers of his left
hand, and a terrific slash that had diagon-
ally and horribly halved his originally un-
prepossessing countenance. But he was
brave as a bulldog and stanch as a steel
girder, and his sorely disfigured head-piece
—finished off with a glare of yellow headker-
chief —topped a still active and vigorous
body, attired only in white cotton drawers
and scarlet sash. From this sash protruded
no kris-handle, for it was the burden of
Jotan’s existence that “Malladi Tuan ”
wouldn’t let him carry arms. This was but
in accordance with the law of the Protected
Malay States, but, as this law was much
honored in the breach, S’ali Jotan consid-
ered that an exception might well have been
made in favor of such an ancient and dis-
tinguished warrior as himself.
“What’s coming, Jotan? Earthquake or
hurricane —or both?”
Mallardyke spoke rapidly in Malay, but
Jotan never allowed himself to be done out
of what he supposed was his excellent Eng-
lish.
“Not ertky,” he said slowly. “Big storram
—plendy big storram. But not yetta. Two-
tree hour —den he dam bad!”
“Well, make all fast with the boats, and
see everything snug about the place. How’ll
WG £6t it?”
Jotan pointed to the thickly-wooden vol-
canic cone that blotted out, from where they
stood, the whole south-eastern quarter of
the fitmament.
“All the better for us,” thought Mallar-
dyke. “But the other side will be pande-
monium. Leroy will be clean knocked out.
Won’t have a coco left standing. Well, I
don't like the man. But I can’t see him
outed for all that, without an attempt to

ORKERS’ ACCIDENTS
KEEP ZAM-BUK ALWAYS HANDY FOR BRUISES, I
CUTS, OPEN, FESTERING & POISONED WOUNDS,etc. |
o.

M
CARPENTERS, bricklayers, mechanics, miners, gar-
deners, painters, laborers—in fact, all classes of
workers—stand in daily need of Zam-Buk’s sooth-
ing and healing aid. A cut, bruise, knock or pinch
may not seem of much account when the first pain
has passed away, but unless the injured place is
dressed with Zam-Buk there remains the great
danger that dirt and disease germs will get into the
wound and set up inflammation, festering, blood-
poison or skin disease, that may mean
months of suffering and compulsory idle-
ness. The germ of the dreaded lockjaw
harbors in dirt, and thus the simplest
injury often has fatal results. If, how-
ever, Zam-Buk is at once smeared over a
cut or bruise, the balm’s pure herbal
juices soothe the pain, fortify the injury
against germ attacks, and ensure rapid
and perfect healing. As an insurance
against festering and poisoned wounds,
eczema and ulcers, Zam-Buk is the
workers’ best friend. A pot of this
powerful germicide and healer should
always be kept handy in cupboard, tool-
bag or pocket.
A*
SCALDS AND BURNS.
“ As I am a cook by profession,” says
Mr. S. Balcoinbe, of Holloway Road,
Mitcheltown, Wellington, N.Z., “ and
constantly engaged over a fire, I am
very liable to receive burns and scalds.
A few days ago I had the misfortune to
have my hand and wrist scalded with
boiling fat. Having Zarn-Buk by me I
at once applied the balm. The heat and
inflammation were at once banished, and
the wounds were soothed. Before night
nearly all traces of the scalds had dis-
appeared. I have always used Zam-Buk
for cuts and sores, and have no hesitation
in pronouncing it a first-class prepara-
tion, which I. for one. will never be
without.”
A COACHBUILDER’S INJURIES.
While following my occupation,”
says Mr. T. Mansell, a coachhuilder, of
Keig Street, Newtown, Sydnev, “lam
constantly knocking the skin off my
hands and cutting my fingers. These
wounds fester and take some consider-
able time to heal, although all sorts of
household remedies have been tried.
Seeing Zam-Buk advertised, I procured
a pot. and am pleased to say that in
Zam-Buk I found just the halm I
required. Its healing action was prompt,
and where it was applied no festering
followed. I strongly recommend Zam-
Buk as an invaluable healing and anti-
septic balm.”

Colic, Diarrhoea and Dysentery
Are diseases that require immediate attention. In almost every neighbourhood
someone has died from these diseases before medicine could be procured or a
physician summoned.
Those who rely upon physicians often find that they are away from home when
most needed.
Every family, and especially those who reside in the back blocks, should keep
at hand a bottle of Chamoerlain’s Colic & Diarrhoea Remedy.
No physician can prescribe a better medicine for the purpose for which it is
intended. It is invaluable for both children and adults.

Night coughs are easily cured if
you only have the right remedy at
hand. The best thing is to always
be prepared with a bottle of Cham-
berlain’s Cough Remedy. A dose
or two will relieve you so you can
have a good night’s rest and get up
fit for work in the morning.

COUGH REMEDY.
warn him. Come along, Jotan. We must
get round the hill to put Leroy Tuan on his
guard.”
With the word, Mallardyke started off,
and Jotan stalked unwillingly after. He
had a personal grievance against Leroy, and
he sniffed now contemptuously at what he
considered a gross misapplication of the
title, Tuan —“lord” or “ruler.”
When the two men had worked round the
shoplder of the hill, they were fain to pull
up in sheer amazement. Both were familiar
with the cyclonic storm in all its varieties,
but never had either looked upon a sight like
this.
Over the whole south-eastern heavens was
spread a pall of sable; indistinguishable
below from the darkened sea beneath it, but
margined above - with a glow of angry red,
as from a mighty furnace. The mass was
shot here and there with curious purple re-
flections, affd had running through it an in-
cessant greenish quiver. And, even as they
looked, this immense curtain lifted at the
horizon, like the foot of a well-cut topsail,
and showed a long, low arc of intense orange
light, against which the sullen sea-line was
thrown once more into view. Then sud-
denly this wild glare disappeared behind a
dull grey curtain of torrential rain, which,
in half a minute, sloped away to the east-
ward and disappeared before a south-west-
erly squall, blowing right athwart the on-
come of the tempest. Intense blackness fol-
lowed, both of sea and sky; then the air
was filled with a weird, uncanny sound —
like the moaning of 10,000 giants, Mallar-
dyke told himself. As this died away, a
ribbon of intensest blue leaped from cloud
to water, and. with a crash that shook the
ash from Mallardyke’s cheroot, the overture
to “El Tornado” commenced. Only the over-
ture, however, for not a breath of air stir-
red, nor fell a drop of rain. The two men
made all haste towards the coco-plantation,
from the midst of which flashed out every
now and then a long, low, white-painted
house, with a row of nip^-thatched huts be-
hind it. Away beyond was a snowy ridsre
of surf where the ominous ground-swell
tumbled tumultously over the fringing reef.
“No time to lose, Jotan!” snapped out
Mallardyke. “There’s wind enough there to
blow the blessed old island off its founda-
tion, and there’s that fool Leroy smoking at
his door as if —come on, Jotan —the idiot
doesn’t seem to have any idea of what’s
brewing!”
Leroy, a tall, well set-up man in the early
30’s, was beautifully neat and cool in spot-
less white drill, and there was cynical
amusement in the way he eyed the sweat-
drenched man who now rushed up to him.
“Pleased to see you, Mr. Mallardyke.
Haven’t often the pleasure of a visit from
you. Bringing a bit of a storm with you,
too, apparently.”
“Lock here, Leroy; there’s no time for
ceremony!”—a blinding glare and a stun-
ning crash emphasised the assertion. “You
must get round with me to the other side of
the hill —see, your men are making off
already—or you will be swept clean out of
existence*”
The other, with an incredulous smile,
waved his hand towards the open door.
“Won’t you honor me?” he said formally.
“But, first” —he advanced suddenly upon
Jotan, who had calmly seated himself upon
the edge of the verandah. “Look here, you
piratical-locking old scoundrel —didn’t I tell
you that if I found you about my place
again, I’d”—he finished the sentence with a
hearty kick in Jotan’s ribs.
Jotan’s English hardly ran to the import
of “piratical miscreant,” but a kick speaks
all languages, and as the Malay sprang to
his feet his hand went like lightning to his
sash. Then was Mallardyke glad of his
“writ of disarmer,” for Jotan now only
proudly folded his arms and turned upon his
master a look which plainly said: “See
what a disgrace thou hast brought upon thy
servant!”
Mallardyke turned angrily to Leroy.
“What the devil do you mean by kicking
my man about like that? Lucky for you I
don’t allow him to carry a weapon. If his
kris had been there when he grasped for it
you’d have been cold meat by this time.”
“Dead enough, possibly,” the other an-
swered imperturbably, “but hardly cold yet.
And as for your disreputable scarecrow of a
henchman, I’ve warned him more than once
to keep away from here. He’s been trying
to breed mischief amongst these lazy scoun-
drels of mine. He hates me like poison, and
I don’t think I’m far wrong in surmising
that he has derived the feeling from his
master.”
Jotan had stalked off to the native huts,
by this time almost deserted, The two
white men faced each other in Leroy’s sit-
time, and a sickly gleam of sunlight, shoot-
ing in low from the north-west, sparkled
upon a host of trinkets on the table.
“I have never liked you, Mr. Leroy,” Mal-
lardyke answered quietly. “Why, I do not
particularly know; but as for hating you”—
His eye fell upon a photograph that stood
near him. He stopped, stared, then snatched
un the picture and took it to the window.
“Yes,” he said then, as if speaking to him-
self. “It is she.”
Leroy gave his eyebrows a supercilious
hoist, as he lit another cigarette. “You are
pleased to be mysterious,” he said. “Might
I ask which of my numerous photographic
‘she’s’ has the honor of exciting your in-
terest?”
Mallardyke did not answer directly. “I
was about to add just now,” he said, “that
I had no reason to hate you. But” —he step-
ped suddenly close, and almost thrust the
photograph into the other man’s face. “Who
is that?” he fiercely demanded.
Leroy did not immediately resent the
tone. He was puzzled and not a little un-
comfortable ; but he puffed nevertheless
calmly at his cigarette as he took the pic-
ture and looked at it steadily. “That?”,he,
said after a pause. “Oh, that’s a lady with
whom I had some passages a few years
back.”
Mallardyke had externally regained his
composure. “Be more explicit,” he said
quietly. “Tender passages?”
Leroy complacently stroked his short rus-
set beard. “Well—yes. You might even say
very tender passages.”
Mallardyke walked round to the other side
of the table, as if to put a barrier between
them. “Did you know,” he asked, slowly
and distinctly, “that she was another man’s
wife?”
The other recovered his insolence of man-
ner. “Yes,” he said ; “I knew it well. And
what then? What has it to do with
you? Goram non judice. You understand
jLatin, I suppose?”
“You’re not before the Judge! By the
Lord, my fine fellow, you’ll find that you are
before the Judge-—and perhaps the execu-
tioner, too. That is a portrait of my wife !”
“Your wife? Why that woman’s name is
Morton —Mrs. Morton.”
' And my name is Morton —John Mallar-
d.yke Morton.”
There was a long pause, filled in with the
distant diapason of returning thunder. Then
a lightning-flash lit up the two faces —fierce,
rigid and alert of eye, for both men were
“heeled,” and the matter in hand had be-
come shooting-ripe. But no pistol was
drawn. Why, I cannot say. Perhaps be-
cause Mallardyke was a good shot and Leroy
a bad one. The fear of killing, as against
the fear of being killed. Or for any other
of a dozen reasons. It is useless to specu-
late.
Then stole in unon the strained situation
a low and soothing sound, like that of a
humming-top nodding to its fall. Mallar-
dyke turned his ear seaward. “Here’s the
first of it!” he said. “Now, Mr. Leroy, our
quarrel will have to wait, and if you value
your life you will come with me !”
“The good-for-evil racket, I suppose,”
sneered the other.
“No!” Mallardyke had now to shout, for
the hum was fast becoming a roar. “Just
plain, practical advice. You’ve not long
bought in, and you’ve no conception of how
it can blow hereabouts? So come along and
save vour skin, even if you lose. your palms.”
“Nonsense,” Leroy said, incredulously.
“Some of the younger trees may go, but” —
“I tell you, man, there won’t be one of
these thousands of trees left standing by to-
morrow morning. Is it not so, .Totan?”
“It is so, Tuan," solemnly answered the
Malay, who had boldly returned to the
verandah. But he now wore a parang, ob-
tained from bne of the huts. Mallardyke
noticed the weapon, but made no remark.
Leroy saw it too, and had no difficulty in
understanding that kicks were now out of
the question. But he wasn’t in a kicking
humor. The appalling uproar was begin-
ning to demoralise him. “Let’s go, then,” he
said suddenly. The three set out on their
perilous journey—perilous, because the hur-
ricane was already blowing half-strength—
-70 miles an hour, Mallardyke estimated;
and the moment they left the lee of the
house, and clasped hands—Leroy in the
middle —they were forced to scud before the
wind, in spite of leaning back against it at
an angle of nearly 45. Just as they reached
the foot of the hill, there came from the
house behind them a sharp, crackling like
musketry-fire, followed by a rending and
riving sound as the whole structure broke up
and went flying in fragments away to lee-
ward. Then came a lull. The stupendous
voice of the tempest was lowered until, by
shouting, they could hear each other’s voices
and, as they pushed their way round the
shoulder of the hill, it fell almost calm —a
very bad sign, as Mallardyke knew; so he
kept on hard until they were far enough
round the curve to be able to pause . for
breath. Then ensued a short but curious
conversation.
“Of course, Leroy,” Mallardyke said,
“I’m getting you round here just to save
your life for the time being.”
“The time being? What are you driving
at?”
“This. I still consider you an infernal
scoundrel; and, though, even by the silly so-
called ‘code of honor,’ I’m entitled to have
one shot at you without return, I’ll waive
that and give you a meeting on equal terms.”
“Curse it, man!” Leroy broke out, “you
might have left all that till the hurricane’s
over. Then —if its effects have been what
you expect —I’ll thank you for shooting a
ruined man !”
“Ah, well,” Mallardyke answered calmly,
“you ruined my life to begin with, so I
don’t much care which of us gets his
quietus. Now, we’ll get on again.”
The matter was thus duly arranged—but
there was a tertium quid.
Jotan, listening to this strange talk, un-
derstood of it only that there was question
of his revered Tuan being shot at by this
other white man, who had already forfeited
his life by applying his profane foot to the
sacred person of S’ali Jotan Tatarangan.
And, as the fierce old man gave himself thus
his full title of the warlike days, he drew
his parang and held it ready in the right
hand that had already taken so many lives.
The hurricane was soon again in full
blast. The noise of the' terrific air-rush was
inconceivable, though even at that they
could faintly hear what would otherwise
have been the ear-splitting cracks of big
trees snapped off like carrots on the wind-
ward side. Even where they were, tree-
limbs were already whirling through the
darkness like bar-shot; and, just as they
got to the foot of the hill, a piece of kanary-
branch hit Mallardyke on the back of the
head and knocked him senseless.
“Your master is killed!” shouted Leroy,
as he stooped over the fallen man.
It was Jotan’s cue. By the gleam of a
lightning-flash he measured his distance,
and, with the full swing of the parang, cleft
Leroy’s skull like an apple.

The cold moon’s corpse-like fingers slowly

The drear plain shudders at the mopoke’s

In mournful cadence, like the banshee’s

A night bird spreads his wings in silent

The horse chains dully clank along the

A plover rises with an eerie shriek.
A sudden hush....and through the topmost

That seems a long time. Yet we are told that Noah was

He was a good workman, too. And there wasn’t any
worry about timber supplies. Nor did he have to
reconstruct his plans. Yet he took 128 years. Why?
Simply because he didn’t have up-to-date machinery to
speedy up production. And to-day there’s many a wood-
