“Racehorses in Australia.” Edited by Dr. Lang,
K. Austin and Dr. Stewart McKav.
Paintings by Martin Stainfortli.
(Art in Australia, Ltd.)
The Australian protests much concernin
his love of the horse; and he does dove th
noble animal, if only because of the oppoi
tunities it affords for betting and carniva
purposes. Yet we have a poor reputatio
abroad as horse-masters. Something of th
materialistic spirit which may be seen on £
great sheep- or cattle-run enters into man)
of our stables. The Irishman, of the north o
south, is the best horse-master in the Em
pire, because every horse is a friend to him
In England a carter would find it difficult to
a street behind an anima
which was going short, without having his
name taken by a policeman. Here the mosi
abominable cruelties to working horses are
accepted by Bench and public as matter-of-
course affairs, like the slow starvation ol
sheep on an overstocked station, at the same
tune as a Beaiiford or Eurythmic is adver-
tised as the- nation’s idol. This, probably,
explains why Australia has had to wait
about a century for the admirable work
which has just been issued by Art in Aus-
tralia, Ltd. In it the horse is not treated as
an attraction worth so many tens of thou-
sands of patrons to a racing-club, but as
a figure of beauty and romance; and the
30b has been done by men who obviously
had their hearts in it. Dr. Lang deals with
the subject on its historical side. There
were great horses in Australia before Steel-
trap made his appearance almost exactly a
century ago, but this famous stallion (whose
stock, by the way, is still to be found in
parts of N. S. Wales and Victoria) brought
m our first instalment of England’s bluest
equine blood. Two brothers were Derby-
wmners, and a sister won the Oaks. A
year later came Manto. She was in foal
to a sire who traced back to Eclipse, and
was destined to be the ancestress of hun-
dreds, perhaps thousands, of champions here
and in Maoriland. By this time the grow-
ing pastoral industry was calling for horses
S, allo P and stay. Captain Browne
( Bolf Boldrewood”) bought Skeleton from
Ins kinsman, Lord Sligo. (Woorak, Soorak
and the rest are of this line.) And at about
the same time William Lawson, of N S
H ales, bought Emigrant from the Hon. 11.
J. Rous. Emigrant is held by many to be
die sire of Petrel, Australia’s first inter-

ing In Dr. Lang’s opinion, “the cham-
3ion laurels hover between the brows of Car-
oine and The Barb.” Leave it at that.
The impossibility of arriving at a decision
s a matter of the absence of a standard of
comparison; courses and the weather affect
the issue, not to mention luck; and jockeys
and tiainers, lose more races than any honest
horse. It is enough to say that if‘Carbine
in mg ~V, arid P r - rjan " seems to think
so—-there have been many others which,
™ a conio s matlon » courage, reasonable-
ness, speed, strength, health and all else
going to compose the perfect horse, were
very near the throne. Dr. Stewart McKay
m a chapter on “The Secret of Staying
Power, which most enthusiasts will find
the most fascinating and suggestive in the
book, indicates the little less (which may
be no fault whatever of the horse) that goes

Wallace stayer to handle, determined to make the

two reasons. In the first place, he hurried his mount
most unwisely for the first half-mile, forgetting what
tied Archer had laid down, as. a rule, that if you
■f, ry , a.staycr long enough for the first half-mile 'you
will kill him dead; and, in the second place, not
b . c ! n s a pathologist, he did not know anything about

that his mounts heart was of the true Wallace
brand. But he found to his dismay that he had
made so much use of his horse that he died in his
hands m the last 50 yards, and Cetigne won The
effort certainly did not do Cetigne’s non-staving
heart any good, for he never ran a decent race over
a distance afterwards.
It is impossible to over-praise the reproduc-
tions of Martin Stainforth’s paintings which
have a section to themselves. They show
the champions in their habits as they lived
or raced, perfect as regards general effect
and in detail. A couple of his plates, by
the way, will cause astonishment amongst
breeders*, they depict stallions running in

f, te 8 nothing to indicate in the
title that the mare is Bonnie Rosette am
the foai Mountain King. The printer has
evidently erred in not explaining that thest
family groups represent a painter’s license
on the part of Stainforth. Some of these
plates suggest a more profitable line of in-
qmry than the whieh-is-the-greatest-horse
one, that has been referred to above, namely •
Has a definite_ Australian type developed ‘iii
the higher equine reaches, and if so what are
its characteristics? The answer seems to
be that such a development was in process
but has stopped. Most of the cracks shown’
here have (imp.) opposite their names or
those of their sires or dams; and so, rela-
tively, they are heavy in front and have legs
and feet which look better suited to the soft
going- of Europe than to our often iron
courses. The writer can remember a class
of Waler, capable of beating Britain’s best,
which was very differently conformed. Mer-
man, for example, with his tremendous with-
ers, light though shoulders, large
feet, sloping pasterns, and sound, flat
iegs. Twenty years ago this type of
horse was the rule rather than the excep-
tion in Australia, and one felt that it suited
its country of origin, just as the lean, tall
lugger embodied the same dry, brown land
during the World War. If there is a single
depressing feature about this beautiful
volume, it is that*the nearer the local horse,
as set forth by eloquent pen and skilled
brush, approaches modern times the more
it becomes not an Australian but a British
horse. This condition of affairs will have to
be changed if the Waler is again to enjoy
the overseas reputation that was his in the
days of Carbine, Trenton, Newhaven, The
Grafter, A urn in and many another that did
great things on British courses ('and ,at
British studs. It is a matter for the breeders
of vision.
Prussian—and Proud of It
My Escape from Bonington Hall,” by
Kapitanleutnant Gunther Pliischow (John
Lane), is poor stuff as literature. The writer
is no .Casanova on the dramatic side; and he
lacks the light touch of the cheery sportsman
whose “The Escaping Club” was reviewed
some time ago on this page. Not to put too
hue a point on it, he makes a rather dull
st°ry out of a series of adventures which
should hold one’s interest from start to finish.
In a sense he made two escapes, both of
them highly meritorious. The first was from
Iviau-Chau, where he acted as artillery ob-
server and scout in a Taube during the invest-
nient by the Japanese. When things became
hopeless his General gave him orders to run
the blockade and destroy his machine on
Chinese territory, which he duly did. He was
trying to get back to Germany when he was
captured by the English. This episode, which
took place at Gibraltar, where he arrived dis-
guised as a Swiss bound for Italy, gives a
fair idea of his crude and noisy style:
In. ?Phe of the fact that the time-table made no
provision for calling,at Gibraltar, the ship entered
the port for examination, without even awaiting a
request to do so, and dropped anchor. To this
extent had the Italians already become the slaves of
the English . As soon as the ship lay to, two pin-
naees descended upon us, from which emerged an
English naval officer and sundry policemen and
sailors armed to the teeth....We had now to ad-
vanee. the tallest amongst us Swiss stood on
the right wmg The English officer went up to
him and said: lou are a German officer.” Violent
and indignant protestations followed; but the Eng-
lishman, whom they left quite cool, ordered him
aside and turned to us—we seemed more the
genuine article in his sight. We pointed to our
passports, and each one of us dished up a wondrous
yarn. My heart was throbbing with joy, but,
alas, then appeared the Judas. A young fellow, in
perfectly-fitting civilian clothes, went up to the
officer and spoke to him in raised tones. “Their
belongings should be thoroughly searched. I am
convinced they are Germans.” We exclaimed loudlv
this, but to no end,thoug*h the Englishman
obeyed this blackguard with evident reluctance and
contempt. The rascal ferreted about everywhere.
Suddenly he whipped round, tore open my coat’
turned out my breast pockets and said triumphantly
to the officer, “You see there is neither a name nor
a monogram. It is a sure sign that he is a German
and that he has destroyed all initials.” Oh, if I
could but have brained the reptile!
Most of us heard protestations of the sort dur-
ing the war from hefty eligibles who were
allegedly debarred from serving the Empire
by the stubborn refusal of the medi
cal profession to pass them as fit. But the
German’s record is sufficient proof that
he was sincere. He really did want to
light m Inlanders; and against the heaviest
odds imaginable eventually did so. Yet his
veracity is questionable at times. It is
notorious that one of the most difficult tasks
which faced transport officers in the sub-
marine zones was that of inducing troops,
both Dominion and Imperial, to realise that
there was any danger. .The Tommies, in
particular, were stolid, unimaginative cus-
tomers, who could not be persuaded to take
the precautions in regard to wearing life-
belts night and day, never striking a match
after dark, and so on, as anything but jokes
—though, of course, they obeyed orders when
it came to the point. Here is the Kapitan-
leutnant s account of his experiences on a
British ship, representing about the only
gleam of humor —albeit of the unconscious
variety—in his verbose and angry book:—
we got into the Channel the crew was seized
with general nervousness and agitation. . . .The Eng-
lish soldiers never stopped questioning us fearfulfy
m regard to our U-boats. And didn’t we make it
hot for them !
At last, after 10 days, we landed at Plymouth,
when the cable chain rattlingly uncoiled itself, and
we knew that we were safe in port, and had escaped
U-boats, we watched the English soldiers falling on
their knees and singing 'hymns of praise and grati-
tude for their salvation from the German submarines.
He may have been the victim, here, of the
humble British fighting-man’s traditional
taste for leg-pulling; but many of liis other
legends bring home to the reader that our
side had no monopoly of the mendacities de-
signed to expose the enemy as a degraded and
cowardly lot of degenerates. Thus:—
the English lock-up usually affords a temporary
domicile to drunken soldiers and sailors who are
picked up in the streets, and who have an oppor-
tunity of sleeping off their intoxication until the
next-day, when they are sent back to their platoon
after a sound thrashing.
And again:—•
„ lr ‘ a , U t he camps where we foregathered with the
English Tommies, their first request after we had
become better acquainted was for a little note with
my address, and possibly the address of friends in
Germany, and an attestation that the English soldier
So-and-So had treated us well. These notes were
treasured as relics to be produced in case of cap-
ture by the Germans. 1
Pliischow is not a pleasant character, as
may be gathered from these few extracts:
he begins Ms second escape
(tiom the famous Ledbury seat, which, bv
the way, he spells throughout with one “n”) "•
one has tlmsneaking hope that he will brin-
it off, which is the tribute paid to every gal-

Come with me where early showers
Hang the hedges all with flowers,

Unwilling arms, as one still loath
To leave bis bed, and lady, both- —

Convention.
The strong conventions, like an ashlar wall,
Have left no narrow windows where the
soul
May gaze upon the sun, nor chink nor hole
Through which the wind of Spring may
warmly call .
To the far spaces where white rivers fall
In thunderous cascade, or oceans roll,
Blue on the deep and greener on the shoal.
The prison made for life is safe and small.
He who would break convention needs must
fear
The crushing weight of that square-
fashioned stone
Heaped on his rashness e’er his soul be free;
But he who climbs above it soon shall hear
The great stars singing and, in softer tone,
The quiet mockery of eternity.

The Doubt.
That he was guilty—l do not say ;
That he was guiltless—l doubt.
The World is a spy with a hundred eyes,
And the World had found him out.
He came with roses that very night.
She chilled him with a glance.
His heart went cold and his pulse went cold,
And they did not talk romance.
The world is a judge in robe and wig
That we may not disobey ;
And her words were ice as she bade farewell,
For the World had said its say.
He crossed the threshold with upright head,
And laughed in the night outside;
A man acts so when his pride is stung,
For a ticklish thing is pride.
And she? She sat in the dark and sang,
And this was the theme of her song—
“ God tell me whether the World be right,
Or whether the World be wrong!”

Wild Love.
Oli, sing me not of home or child.
I who am now so sad and still !
I thought my love could be as wild
As grass upon the hill!
I cannot live with bolts and bars,
I would go freer than the breeze,
Who looks to see the yellow stars
Hid only by the trees.
Now, I would seek the fox’s lair—
Some windy place by silence girt.
No canting voice will echo there;
There will be none to hurt!
Only the peeping eyes a-gleam,
Of bird and beast in bush and brake,
Will see the sorrows of my dream,
And watch me sleep or wake.
For love, sweet love, that ecstasy
Of charmed caress and fiery kiss,
Must trim its shape to man’s decree,
Must be as that —and this!
And passion’s flame were shame to fan,
And pure desire a deadly sin!
Ah. how the iron laws of man
Press down and hem me in!
Oh, sing me not of home or child,
1 who am now so sad and still!
My lore, my love, must he as wild
As grass upon the hill!

BECKY
Home Garden.
The children are racing in the garden, just
below me,
And the sweet, unstinted music of their
laughter stings my heart;
It mocks my thoughts of what the world
and man and nature owe me.
And I’m driven to think of what we owe
the children for their part.
For, as I watch, a cloud glooms up to dim
the children’s laughter,
A cloud that holds the pains and doubts
and fears of years to be;
So my gold of present joy is dulled: Spring
passes, and thereafter
Come the years of test and tempting of
the man-child dear to me.
Dear to me though when he faces perils dire
that shall beset him,
His voice will speak no longer any word
my ears can hear....
Sad to think my boy may fight with beasts
and deem that I forget him
Out in that deep-shadowed silence that
no son’s brave laugh can cheer!
The children are ageing in the garden, yet
thev save me
From doubting that the gods can safely
end what they began,
And I glow with pride anew in that great
blessedness they gave me,
The babe ,in whom I still shall live when
he becomes a man!
Ah, hut here Pm laughing now, as for me
the sunset's calling!
Just to see him there contented, mind and
hody, sane and whole!
What have I to do with zealots, rant or
mawkish bigots' brawling?
God, Pve no anxiety at all about his soul!

When M trdoch’s set out to give Service to Sportsmen
it didn’t take a “century” to bring down so-called

Thus Murdoch’s set “the” standard.
Is it any wonder that soon the Sports Department

AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE SEA
DRY.
A couple of cable messages which arrived
recently from the TJ.S. disclosed an odd de-
velopment of the Prohibition campaign. The
Supreme Court —which used to take rank
with the English Privy Council and the
classic appeal courts of the European con-
tinent, but which, since the war, has degen-
erated on constitutional questions into a
mere instrument of the Government of the
day—decided (1) that foreign merchant
ships may not bring alcohol into U.S. ports,
and (2) that U.S. merchant ships may not
have alcohol on board in foreign ports. The
two rules are self-contradictory. If Wash-
ington has jurisdiction over foreign ships in
U.S. ports, then it cannot logically claim
jurisdiction over U.S. ships in foreign ports.
Actually, of course, there are only two in-
stitutions which carry their national terri-
tories with them everywhere—battleships
and embassies. The U.S. Government has
no de jure right, which is likely to be accepted
by lawyers outside the U.S., to control the
vessels of its mercantile marine while they are
within the three-mile limit of another Power
—though de facto things might certainly
be made awkward at home for a Yankee ship-
ping company which insisted oh taking the
opposite view. But it has power, both de
facto and de jure, to prevent strong drink,
or any other commodity, being brought in-
side its own territorial waters, and no nation
is likely to be so foolish as to argue to the
contrary. At present the White Star and
Canard liners, which carry alcohol, are wip-
ing the non-alcoholic U.S. passenger ships
off the face of the North Atlantic. The
thing was inevitable from the first. Given
a fair run and no favor, a temperance liner
can have no more chance in competition with
the other sort of carrier than a coffee-
palace would have against a first-class hotel.
The profits on the drinks sold aboard a ship
like the Mauretania during any given trip
run into thousands sterling; but an even
greater consideration, financially, is the fact
that the presence of liquor attracts those
whom shipping companies like best to carry.
Many may not drink at all, and most of
them only drink in moderation, but all will
pay any sum in reason for the privilege of
being where their liberty is not curtailed
in this respect. So that the British com-
panies may be depended on to fight as hard
for the continued right to sell liquor at sea
as the Harding Administration is bound to
struggle in the other direction.
* * * »
Assume that the cable message which
reached Australia from New York at the
end of last month is an accurrate summary
of the judgment given, and it is clear that
sea-borne liquor will not be allowed inside
the U.S. three-mile limit under any circum-
stances whatever —not even, that is to say,
in bond. The likeliest response of the foreign
shipping companies will be to institute sea
hotels. Nothing would be easier. The aero-
plane carriers which were used so extensively
in the closing years of the World War point
the .way. Floating liquor dumps might be
stationed outside the three-mile limit along
the U.S. coasts, in the neighborhood of the
great harbor?, at which ingoing ships would
be able to unload and outgoing ones to take
up, their drink supplies. In law the U.S.
Government would have no more control over
such vessels than if they were lying off the
coast of Kent. It has been noted above that
the Supreme Court claims for the U.S. Gov-
ernment power to make its national mercan-
tile marine “dry” even in foreign waters;
and at least one Yankee shipping company
has already conformed. However, the gen-
eral attitude in the States towards the
Volstead Act and its amendments does not
encourage the idea that all will be equally
docile, no matter what penalties they are
threatened with for recalcitrancy. Some may
decide to do business with the marine bulk
stores, if only as a means of holding their
own against the alcoholised foreign ships.
It is hard, moreover, to see what right the
Ij.S. Government could claim to prevent its
thirsty nationals from visiting these insti-
tutions in other vessels besides trans-Atlantic
passenger steamers. For territorial purposes
a Yankee is as well and truly outside his
native land when he has steamed three miles
and one yard away from it as he would be
m Rome or Reykiavik. A number of brand-
new industries might thus be expected to
spring up along the coasts of the great Re-
public, while several old ones would be
resuscitated, and considerable aid given to
the solution of the unemployed problem, due
to the country’s stricken export trade fol-
lowing on its glut of gold. Yachting, for
example, would get such an impetus as it
has never known in the world’s history, and
we might expect to hear of famous designers,
such as Fife, and sailmakers, like Lapthorn.
settling down permanently in the U.S. The*
seaplane would come into its own with a
rush, and the weather-, fool- and drunk-proof
plane would doubtless be quickly evolved.
Faced with a retail as well as a'wholesale
trade, the floating bulkstores would naturally
develop into floating inns as well. They
would be driven to install not only bars,
lounges, billiard-rooms and the rest, but bed-
rooms for week-ending convivialists. As
such establishments grew more luxurious,
their patrons would be tempted to stay
longer, till after a while they might
begin to make inroads, on the profits
of the teetotal summer hotels of the main-
land. The tendency would be to employ
Yankee servants, engineers, electricians,
barbers, shoe-shiners, , cocktail-mixers and
bar-tenders, operatives, launderers, bakers,
butchers, cooks—in fact, almost every variety
of employee needed in the running of a great
modern caravanserai. And, similarly, most
of the contracts for repairs, decorations, fur-
nishing, painting and the like, together with
all the payments for fuel and every form of
foodstuff but alcohol, would go to the main-
land and help to enrich its citizens. All*
of this might seem fantastic if something
closely analogous were not happening in the
Bermudas and along the Canadian border at
the present moment. The only real
tinction between the two cases is likely to
be one of an unfavorable nature to the
Administration which is fighting to enforce
Prohibition. Those who are struggling to
make the continent dry have created hos-
tile vested interests which, anyhow, are now
chiefly outside the U.S., and hence are, for
the most part, voteless and politically inarti-
culate : an attempt to make the sea dry
must build up a fresh force of antagonistic
political opinion at the politicians’ very
doors.
* * * *
Suppose, in the first place, that Washing-
ton goes blindly ahead; and there is nothing
in the recent history of the Prohibition
movement to suggest that it will not. It may
either discriminate between foreign and
home vessels which make use of the bulk
stores across the three-mile boundary, or it
may try to forbid the latter altogether—
though with no more actual right than it
at present possesses to forbid a Canadian,
or, for that matter, an English, brewery.
If British and French liners are permitted
to take up and set down alcohol, and those of
the U.S. are penalised for doing so, the ruin
of the Republic’s mercantile marine, and the
resulting permanent collapse of the coun-
try’s overseas trade, can be only questions
of time. (The same will apply, incidentally,
if foreign ships are allowed to be “wet” on
the ocean, provided they place their alcohol
in bond upon reaching U.S. territorial
waters, unless the Supreme Court reverses
its decision—27/10/’22 —debarring “Ameri-
can ships from carrying liquor in any over-
seas territory, or wherever they be.”) The
other alternative is for Washington to penal-
ise heavily, or bar altogether, any foreign
ship trading to the U.S. which carries
liquor on the voyage there, or proposes to
on the voyage home. This would, at the
same time, obviate the menace of the marine
pub, and drive most of the nation’s present
competitors off the sea routes converging on
America. However, it would certainly not
be taken lying down by the Powers con-
cerned —Powers which look on real Prohibi-
tion as a dream about as practicable as real
Freetrade. There are thousands of devices
by which one nation can show its dis-
approval of the color, habits, customs, social
and industrial standards and what not of
another nation. Our language test for immi-
grants is only one instance. On similar Lnes
Britain might decree that while the light to
make the ocean dry was in progress no alien
would be admitted who chewed gum or was
unable to pronounce the word God to the
satisfaction of an Oxford don. The Yan-
kees are now exercising a restraint on immi-
gration which is quite as offensive, in its
incidence, by means of their “Three Per Cent.
Law.” If Britain or France or Spain or
Portugal did not care to discriminate against
visitors from the U.S. in so personal a
manner, certain alterations in their respec-
tive anti-dumping laws might be just as
effective. America wants Europe as a buyer
a good deal more than Europe wants
America as a seller. But retaliations have
a way of producing retaliations; and be-
tween nations, as between individuals, when
the vicious circle has been completed often
enough there is liable to be war. It would
be a fitting crown for Prohibition’s crazy
brow, if in the attempt to enforce the unen-
forceable, the misguided supporters of tee-
totalism landed humanity in another world-
war.
THE ANTI-DIGGER VARIETY OF
UNION OFFICIAL.
In Queensland last week the Full Arbitration
Court, consisting of McCawley, C.J., and
Justices Macnaughton and O’Sullivan,
unanimously refused the application of eight
trade unions for the deletion from their
awards of a clause exempting returned sol-
diers and sailors from the operation of the
preference-to-unionists rule. Argument in
support of the application was heard on
October 6. The eight organisations were
represented by two union secretaries and
backed by a body calling itself the Returned
Soldiers’ Labor League. On. the opposing
side were the Employers’ Federation,
three other associations of employers
and the Returned S. and S. Imperial
League. In a statement read to the Court
by the League organiser it was mentioned
that 604 service men were unemployed in the
metropolitan district alone, and that “if the
application is successful it will mean that
large numbers will be thrown out of work or
prevented from obtaining it.” Other points
urged were as follow:
Exemption from preference to unionists was granted
because of (1) sacrifices made for the country; (2)
disabilities occasioned by young soldiers not having
learned a trade or calling before enlistment, and (3)
disabilities arising from wounds or sickness.
The withdrawal of the concession would spell ruin
to men in classes 2 and 3. Under existing con-
ditions many are employed as casual or temporary
hands, but if they had to join a different union
every time they went after a job—to be told, per-
haps, by the secretary that half-a-dozen members
would have to be accommodated first —they would
never get work.
The R.S.S.I.L. has consistently supported the
unions, lor soldiers wishing 10 join them it has
supplied the fees, and where Digger-unionists have
become unfinancial it has paid up the arrears. But
this friendly spirit has not been reciprocated. In
some cases the preference clause has been “consist-
ently disregarded.” In others returned soldiers have
been hounded out of their jobs.
Finally it was suggested that those* respon-
sible for the proceedings wefe not Digger-
unionists, nor even the rank and file of the
organisations, but officials splashed with Red.
At the outset the Trades and Labor Council
alleged that it had been instructed to oppose
exemption by 40 registered unions, but only
10 signed the plaint filed with the court regis-
trar, and two of these withdrew before the
case was heard.
* * * *
One noticeable feature of the application
was its brazen impudence. The Court was
asked to give legal sanction to repeated acts
of lawlessness. It was invited to ratify con-
structive defiance of its own decrees. Par-
ticulars were given of a shameful case alreadv
mentioned in The Bulletin —that in which
a Digger, who had been given a job in the
►State Butchery Department (inadvertently,
nj doubt), was told to get a union ticket,
A being the Government’s policy to employ
none but unionists, and on application to
the union was informed that its books were
closed. In another notorious instance a
soldier-bricklayer from Sydney got work on
a Brisbane building, applied to the union for
a ticket (he had had one in N. S. Wales)
and received an ultimatum instead, being
ordered to get off the job and out of the
country. Being a Digger, lie persisted in
the crime of toiling for his bread, whereupon
his fellow-workmen were called out, and the
employer was boycotted. But the advo-
cates who appeared for the eight applicant
unions didn t turn a hair. One advanced
the proposition that a unionist who went
to the war should be satisfied to take pot
luck. To which the President replied that
he knew of cases in the meat industry where
men who were “regular” unionists when they
enlisted had had to start again as casuals;
and that the generosity of the union over-
whelmed him. The other person was asked
whether the unions he represented admitted
all the returned soldiers who solicited the
honor. “I am not sure,” he said. “We
know,” the C.J. proceeded, “that the store-
men and packers have closed their books.
What about the waterside workers?” “And
the meat industry union?” added Justice
Macnaughton. The gentleman again pro-
tested that he “couldn’t say,” and was told
that he ought to be able to say. In the
President’s phraseology, he and ’ his asso-
ciate essayed to establish the bald general
proposition that in no case was the Court
justified in excepting returned soldiers from
the adverse operation of a clause giving pre-
ference to unionists.” They set up the mon-
strous claim that a union is entitled, merely
because it is a union, to restrict its mem-
bership whenever the caprice seizes it, and,
by a sinister abuse of the preference-to-
unionists rule, to deny even men who have
fought for their country the right to earn
their bread.
* * * *
The Court’s judgment is unanswerable,
and in delivering it the President said some
admirable things. Excellent was his sHfe
£or tte « S'X
avocation which would fit him to earn a living h"*
serving his country-in most casef Hsking lSe and
limb—an avocation which, though of paramonni
importance, tended to unfit him for hfs forme,
civilian occupation. The continuity of his ofrl
civilian service so important for his advancement-
was broken, and m many cases he found that others
while he was away, had acquired the knowledge
necessary to fill his former position, had possession
of it, and had become quite as useful, perhaps more
useiul, to his old employer. There vvere unanswer
able leasons why special efforts should have been
made by the community to restore the soldiers to
possums at least as favorable as those which they
sacnficed. In many instances they were so restored'
in others the machinery established proved insuffl-
thp'p t 0 f 6^ ect the _ result - Ifc is not th e function of
the Court to apportion the blame, if blame there be
for so many soidiers being workless, but it is clear
that it is the duty of the Court not to place unneces-
sary obstacles in the way of employers giving employ-
ment to returned men. J
These remarks may be read with profit, and
not by union secretaries alone. They inti-
mately concern employers who have flappers
working their lifts, and racing clubs wnich
hire women and civil servants to operate
their totalisators, instead of maimed sol-
diers._ They apply with special force to in-
stitutions like the Commonwealth Bank
which could employ 250 more Diggers than
it has on its pay-sheets, only it prefers
girls. Allowing for the baneful effects
ot slump and misgovernment, it is no
credit to the Queensland employer that so
many of those who defended his possessions
with their lives should be out of work. But
the following sentiments are as feeble as the
others are felicitous :
If preference is granted to a union which refuses
new members, or puts difficulties in the way of their
joining the union, a virtual monopoly of any work
ottering in the industry is given to the then members
ot the union. In sucli cases the Court would not—
except in very special circumstances—be justified in
granting preference without, at all events, protect-
ing the interests of returned soldiers.
In no circumstances, special or otherwise,
would the Court be justified in grant-
ing preference to a union which re-
fuses membership to any citizen without rea-
sonable cause. Not only should preference
be withheld ill such a case, or cancelled if
it exists, but the union should be deregistered
until it can show that its books are open to
any reputable citizen who wants- to labor in
his vocation for a lawful wage. It has been
too much the fashion to treat unionism as an
institution combining the impeccability of
the King with the infallibility of the Pope.
11ns explains, among other things, why the
agents of Bolshevism are allowed to stir up
lawless strikes, and the agents of Tammanv
to _ extort money for the propagation of
opinions which the victims loathe. But it
will be a black day for Australia when the
union is empowered to say to the individual,
be he soldier or civilian, not merely that
_ xou can’t work unless you become a union-
ist, ’ but “You shan’t work because we won’t
let you become a unionist..”
WHERE PROCREATION IS A CREED.
Dear Bulletin, —I hate to contradict
Ieloop” (B. 21/9/’22), but his calabash
is full of holes. His theory that the white
iace is responsible for the teeming millions
of Asia certainly its representatives on the
spot have sometimes done their bit—appeal's
to rest on the assumption that the Asiatic
was a polygamist before tne white man came,
that polygamy is synonymous with restnc-
tion of births and that the white man, by
teaching the native that a plurality of wives
was not respectable, induced him to abandon
the custom, and this was indirectly the
cause of the present overcrowded condition
of Asia. This theory, I maintain, will not
hold water. To begin with, the Asiatic is
not, and never was, a polygamist, except in
theory. To 90 per cent, of the Chinese nation
the possession of a harem, seraglio, zenana
or its Celestial equivalent is a voluptuous
dream incapable of realisation in this hard
world, however possible it may be in the
next. The Indian ryot and the Javanese
tarn have, like the Australian cocky, to be
contented with monogamy. The Syrian
fellahin may revel in the prospect of innu-
merable houris in Paradise, bpt his hard-
working spouse would want to know some-
thing about it if he tried to anticipate his
vision on this plane. The Malay fisherman
hncls one “enemy in the blanket” as much as
he can manage, and a single “dull thorn”
keeps the Korean agriculturist busy.
The Emperor may have his thousand
wives, the wealthy official or merchant may
have his five or six, but the coolie or peasant,
tor the excellent reason that he cannot
afford any more, must solace himself as best
he can with a single soul-mate.
It may be that the small class which has
come under the influence of Western ideas
during the last few generations has been
impressed, by a perusal of our divorce-court
rer- >rds, with the superiority of European
sexual morality, and has beet,me ashamed of
its own libidinousness ; but the privileged and
well-to-do classes have relatively no effect
upon the birth-rate. It is in the peasant’s
hut, the festering beggars’ camps and the
pullulating slums of the cities that Asia
recruits its millions, repairing in a single
generation the casualties caused by great
famines, pestilences and wars.
?- s Asia is to-day, so she has always
been. Two thousand years ago the Chinese
annals state that the “whole of the nomads
put together scarcely number as many
as the population of a Chinese township
area.” In 755, when China was only half
its present area, the population was esti-
mated at over 52 million mouths, and at a
time when European influence was confined
to the proselytising of a few monks, Marco
Polo., says, “there are 1200 towns in all
Manji, and 1,600,000 houses in Kinsai
(Hangchow) alone.” The letters of the
missionary friars who penetrated to Cathay
in the 13th century all speak of its teeming
population, the intensive cultivation of the
land and the bloated corpulency of the cities,
although the country was only just recover-
ing from one of the periodical blood-lettings
which seem destined to relieve the pressure
upon the means of subsistence. Ibn
Batuta, that shrewd 14th-century Arabian
tourist who took his pleasure as he found it,


remarks of the great Hwang-Ho that mighty
river which is China s great soilow and ffei
greater healer, that it runs thiou fe h tue
heart of China and is bordered throughout
with villages, cultivated plains, orchards an
markets, just like the Nile in Fgypt. nut
this country is still more Aounshing In
a lyric passage lie declares that the Larbo
of zaitun is one of the greatest in the world.
lam wrong: it is the greatest! I have seen
there about one hundred hrst-class junks
together; as for small ones they were past
counting!” Of Khansa he says that this
city is the greatest 1 have seen on the sur-
face of the earth. It is three days journey
in length, so that a traveller passing thiough
the city has to make his marches and his
halts.” “Cathay,” he says, “is the best cul-
tivated land in the world; in the whole coun-
try vou will not find n bit of ground lying
fallow. The reason is, that if a piece of
ground be left uncultivated, they still oblige
the people on it, or if there be none, the
people nearest to it, to pay the land-tax.
Gardens, villages and cultivated fields line
the two banks of the river in
succession from the city of Khansa to the
city of Ivhanbaliq, a space of 64 days’ jour-
ney.”
Through the journals of Peter Mundy
(1628-1667) and John Fryer (1672-1681)
runs that sense of the redundancy of human
life, of the procreative recklessness which
converts the fair world into a writhing ant-
heap waiting to be stamped on, which still
oppresses the modern traveller in Asia.
“After our coming to this place (Handeea)
there was a Crewe of Rusticks, all of them
more then halfe drunck, there wives in little
better case, daunceinge, which was the
celebration of the betrothing of one of the
Bettearees Children, not 40 days old, to
another title Childe, and to be married in
two yeares after; It being the custome of
all Hindooes in this Countrye to contract
and marry their Children att 5, 6 and 7
yeres of age, and soe they live and goe to-
gether when they please without takeinge
any more notice.”
Parts of Asia, now waste and swamped in
jungle, or desiccated by the age-long drift of
desert sand, once carried large populations,
as the vast ruins of cities and temples at
Anuradhapura in Ceylon, Angkor Wat in
Cambodia and in Central Asia, testify. The
Book of the Knowledge of the World, writ-
ten by a Franciscan monk in the 14th cen-
tury, says of Mesopotamia, that “this region
contains very extensive lands, many cities
and villages, and is all encircled by the two
great rivers called Eufrates and Cur.”
Sze-Chuen, that marvellous inland province
of China which is half the size of France
and twice as thickly populated, has twice in
recent times been devastated, once in the
time of Kublai Khan and again 250 years
ago during the Manchu subjugation. Each
time the depopulation was so complete as to
be almost absolute, but to-day Sze-Chuen i 3
stated to contain 80,000,000 souls. No
theory of the influence of Western teaching
on Asiatic habits will explain these horrific
statistics.
The superstitious observances connected
with Asiatic birth, marriage and burial are
legion, and if the Japanese custom of tight-
ening the pregnant woman’s obi in the fifth
month may be interpreted as a survival of
an original custom of birth control, the
Alalay berdiang ceremony, in which the
newly-delivered mother, ostensibly to ward
off evil spirits, is baked over an oven of
filthy refuse, might be interpreted as a sur-
vival of a custom of getting rid of superflu-
ous wives; These local customs have no
bearing on the central problem of Asia’s
quiverful. That quiver has always been full
to bursting, because of certain fundamental
assumptions of Oriental society. One is
that in Asia the individual is of no import-
ance. The family is the social unit. Woman
is a chattel. Children are brought into the
world because the family must be preserved.
A married couple in China who deliberately
refused to bring more children into an
already overcrowded community would be
guilty of the most hideous offence known, to
Oriental codes. They would be condemning
their myriads of ancestors to spiritual star-
vation, and those terrifying shades would
wreck a terrible revenge upon them for their
unfilial conduct. In India the assumption
is that, all life being precious, the parents
who delay their daughter’s marriage after
the age of puberty has arrived are guilty of
murder. For a handful of Western edu-
cated intellectuals these beliefs might have
no terrors, but for the mass of the people
they still have the validity they always had.
The real difference between East and
West is psychological. In Asia the idea is
the thing; in Europe the thing is the thing.
Europe is saturated with physical know-
ledge ; Asia is satiated with the science of
the mind. Europe tests her most venerable
dogmas and if they fail pragmatically she
discards them; Asia submits to the mon-
strous tyranny of a suicidal concept with
tragic fatalism, even if it devour her. She
is submitting to the tyranny of Western
methods with the same tragic fatalism. As
“Yeloop” remarks, she is being speeded up.
A proletariat of factory workers is already
in process of formation. Her natural re-
sources are being better exploited, and the
increasing supply of raw material thus made
available is being turned into the manufac-
tured article on the spot. Modern methods
of transport are opening fresh markets and
increased prosperity is creating new needs.
The age of machinery will multiply Asia’s
productivity a hundredfold, and she will re-
spond to the stimulus in her immemorial
way by breading up to and beyond the new
limits of subsistence which Western effort
will have made for her.—Yours,
FENG-SHUI.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
An Attempt to Choke the New-State Cat
with Cheese.
“It is a curious thing about Federation that
it gives one very, strange bedfellows.” So
mused the Priminister when introducing his
Constitution Convention Bill, which was
dropped in 1921 with the assurance that a
revised version would be passed in 1922,
which revised version didn’t materialise last’
session and is now promised, with the same
cynical effrontery, for the next Parliament.
Jestingly he recalled how he had joined with
the Calico Jimmies of that day (“gentleinen
who stood, if anyone did, for the ancient
regime”) to oppose national union, and how
they and he had “fought very well together
because we thought that Federation would
be bad for N. S. Wales, which, to us, was
the beginning and end of all national great-
ness.” Odd that the New-States campaign
should have had the same effect. Even as
Federation did, it has obliged the Big-City poli-
ticians, Labor and Nationalist, to herd in
the one paddock. Bitterly as they wrangle
on other subjects, they are united in resist-
ing- the efforts of dissatisfied sections, weary
of being misruled from Macquarie-street, to
set up legislatures of their own. The hos-
tility of the old gang to a movement which
is as natural as Federation was, and as
inevitable, is expressed in various ways. One
is to profess a burning enthusiasm for the
extension of local self-government, and sug-
gest that glorified shire councils would meet
the case. That is Charlton’s proposal.
Another manoeuvre is to insinuate that the
agitation must fail (1) because the N. S.
Wales Parliament would never concede the
necessary powers, and (2) because there is
no chance in the world of getting them via’
the referendum. That is Hugiies’s attitude.
A third expedient is to temporise by refer-
ring the question to a nebulous and dateless
convention. That course was followed by.
the Fuller Government when a resolution
in favor of a new State for the Northern
Rivers was proposed by Bruxner, the Pro-
gressive leader. The same Government’s
Border Railways Bill is a device of another
description. It is a feeble attempt to choke
the cat with cheese, a transparent effort to
kill the Riverina branch of the New-States
organisation with kindness. The measure
authorises Victoria to build four bridges and'
four railways across the Murray. When
piloting it through the Leg. Council, Joseph
Carrutiiers made the following remarkable
admissions as to the impossibility of getting
the Sydney Government to develop the
Riverina —and Joseph has been a Sydney
politician for 35 years:—
One of the lines to be built from Vie. will go from
Gonn to Stony Crossing; another from a point on
the Deniliquin-Moama railway to Balranald. They
will serve a vast territory containing abundance of
magnificent land —some of the most fertile in the
State. Balranald is on the Murrumbidgee, and the
Murray is within reach. It is about 130 miles from
our nearest railway at Hay. We have not contem-
plated extending our railway system there. The
people are not likely to get a railway from
N.S.W. in our time. I suppose the task
of opening up our territory is so great and the
claims so vary that that part has had to
stand by, admittedly neglected, Simply because we
have not got the means to develop it as it should
be developed. The proposed railways will bring
Stony Crossing within 235 miles of its natural port
(Melbourne), and Balranald within 277 miles, and
will put them on the map. Those towns are now
derelict—practically they have been going back for
the last 30 or 40 years—but the railways will make
them thriving and progressive centres.
In these artless sentences Carrutiiers gave
the show away. The case for self-govern-
ment of the rich provinces that Sydney has
despoiled and starved has never been more
memorably put. It is significant that the
only two important measures passed by the
Sydney Parliament this session are the
Border Railways Bill, every clause of which
is a confession that the experiment of run-
ning the Riverina from Sydney has hope-
lessly broken down, and the Harbor Bridge
Bill, which makes the country responsible for
half the cost and maintenance of a mere
Sydney convenience, one so enormously ex-
pensive that it will be years before money
is available for the long-promised railways to
connect neglected districts with their natural
ports. Do what they will, the Big-City poli-
ticians can’t help furnishing the New-Staters
with effective arguments and encouragements
to go ahead.
More Brave Words from Mr. Weaver.
In tlie N. S. Wales Assembly on Thursday
night, Air. Weaver, of North Shore, re-
newed his attack on the Digger settlers,
whom lie assailed last month. He was evi-
dently going on the principle that it is as
well to be hanged for a sheep as a lamb —
his excuse, made to the R. S. League, that
in his previous assault on the soldiers he
was only referring to specified undesirables
having been refuted by the evidence of Han-
sard. In his second deliverance he addressed
himself frankly to that section with which
he is, in the nature of things, affiliated —
those able-bodied non-starters who have no
time for ex-soldiers, good or bad. After a
windy defiance of The Bulletin and its re-
fiections upon his personal courage—a much
less convincing proof of courage, inciden-
tally, than that which was given during the
war by the meanest of those whom he is
now seeking to dishonor—he proceeded to
explain, in effect, that his object in insulting
the settlers was to regenerate the A.I.F.
by purging it of its “criminals.” He is
understood to possess a flair for work of the
sort. His activities in connection with the
smelling-out of alleged undesirables in the
N. S. Wales tramway service constituted
liis chief contribution to the saving of the
Empire while the worst of the fighting was
on in Flanders anfl Palestine. Yet history
does not record that, from the beginning to
the end of the war, he tried to prevent so
much as one malefactor beino- sent overseas
to fight for him and his estate agency. This
expert identifier of wickedness had to wait
fill our late enemies were four years dead
and buried as combatants before discovering
that all Australia’s soldiers were not saints,
and with that as a text, setting out to sug-
gest, from behind the shield of Parliamen-
tary privilege, that numbers are unmitigated
blackguards. There is only one cheering
feature about the young legislator’s out-
break. It signifies that, in all human likeli-
hood, there will not be another great war in
our time. It is safe to throw mud at these
soldier-settlers, many of whom, however un-
righteous, left the only capital they had—
their health, mental and physical—on the
other side of the world in the cause of
Empire. Neither they, nor their mates, are
likely to be needed again. And it is shrewd
customers like Mr. Weaver —citizens who
all their public lives have been clever enough
to get kudos out of the Empire, while being
far too clever to risk anything for it —that
sense such a position first. And yet if
Weaver had had a vestige of delicacy, not to
say decency, he would have curbed his
understandable distaste for the men who
were enlisting while he was talking about
it, fighting for Australia while he was spying
on tramguards, and being shot down while
lie was pervading Sydney in a T.B.L.’s
uniform; and he would have let some better
qualified person undertake the business of
cleaning up the moral reputation of an Army
with which, for whatever reason, he never
fought. But the Weavers of this world are
not built that way. They run true to a well-
defined type. While a big war is in progress
they howi denunciations of those who are
not fighting, and when it is over they howl
very similar denunciations of those who have
fought. Unless the unexpected happens and
Mr. Weaver and his business are again
imperilled by a foreign foe, we may expect
periodical discourses from him about the
“drunkards,” “wasters” and “thieves” of the
A.I.F. till the grave closes over his manly
form and the rest of him goes to that Val-
halla which contains the spirits of Bom-
bastes, Pecksniff, Pistol and the rest.
«
Still “Too Proud.”
Dear Bulletin, — Speaking as an Austra-
lian in London, I must own to a certain
impatience with “America’s traditional
policy of aloofness from European politics”
that we have all heard so much about of late.
During the recent crisis at Constantinople,
after the French and Italians had left the
danger-zone on the pretext that their pres-
ence in Allied territory might excite Kemal’s
soldiery, the attitude of the U.S. Govern-
ment was a well-nigh perfect study in cat-
and-chestnut diplomacy. Since the Armistice
U.S. firms, including the Standard Oil Co.
at Salonika, have been “planting” business
and new agencies in nearly every desert town
where the sirocco blows. From Timbuctu to
Khartum the Stars and Stripes wave above
gilt-domed picture-palaces owned and con-
trolled by Broadway syndicates. Their type-
writing agencies and gramophone emporiums
stretch from the Nile to the Euphrates. The
German bagman confesses wretchedly that he
is a dead man compared with the tinhorn from
Chicago and the razor-blade expert from Con-
necticut. As a matter of fact, none of the
Continental sellers lias a chance against
Uncle Sam’s representatives when it comes
to giving away “overbought stock.” All
Europe is aware of the U.S. trader’s activities
in Turkey and the Near East, and no one be-
grudges him the business thus won from the
sheiks and merchants of the Mediterranean
and North African towns. The competition
and risks are open to all comers. It is when
trouble arises that his peculiar mentality is
revealed. While business is good and the war
bugles are plugged with cork, he “stands in”
with the other consulates. He is the big
noise and his handgrip is harder and firmer
than that of any Jew or Turk. But the
fact that he is enabled to trade in security
with Egyptian and Levantine firms at the
expense of some other fellow’s army never
seems to enter liis head. During the recent
debacle at Smyrna, when Kemal’s Black
Guards threatened to overwhelm the British
battalion at Chanak, the operatives and em-
ployees of the numerous Yankee firms, includ--
ing those of the Standard Oil Co., had no
other protection than the bit of rag that
fluttered over their burnt-out cinema theatre.
Later on, certainly, a U.S. warship entered
the harbor, but the work of protecting re-
fugees and American business people was
wholly left to the British. And when
Britain has spent many millions in rendering
this particular locality safe for traders (a
duty in which she is still engaged), the
American will coolly return to his cocktail at
the Consulate, to tell you that the clerned
hubbub was none of his, and that Washing-
ton isn’t going to degrade itself down to. the
level of mere European trash by getting mixed
up in Britain’s petty squabbles. Similarly,
when Egypt was in the throes of rebellion,
numbers of American firms fled, saying that
“the derned noise didn’t belong to them at
all!” Their argument rests solidly on the
theory that it is John Bull’s job to keep
Egypt and other distant countries in a fit
and proper condition for American bagmen,
oil-jobbers, bridge-builders and car-importers.
The obvious idea is, that every time an Ameri-
can picture-palace or wooden-ham syndicate in
the Middle or Near East is in danger of
demolition by invading Asiatics or Balkanese,
Britishers, Australians and Maorilanders will
take charge of the situation and transport
parks of guns and brigades of men to ensure
the safety of America’s cargoes of trade.
Uncle Sam may lend them some of the money
he has earned in just such places, but he will
take particular care to ask for it back with
interest the moment the locality has been
pacified sufficiently to enable him to start
exploiting it again. Politically American
aloofness in such matters may be sound:
morally its position seems to me to be akin
to that of the jackal or the coyote, which
snatches food where it can and fills its hide
at the other fellow’s grub-pile, without worry-
ing in the least about the latter’s domestic
tribulations. —Yours, etc., Albert Dorring-
ton.
Names Badly Wanted.
The final chapter of the remarkable story
of W. M. Hughes’s liegira from Bendigo
was written last week in the form of a
presentation to Archdale Partciiill of
£2500. Air. Parkiiill is the Nationalist
organiser, who first got promises of support
from every anti-Labor League in the new
constituency, and then cast himself for
lead in the local pre-selection comedy. In
ordinary circumstances the Nationalist selec-
tion, in such a home of conservatism as
North Sydney, carries the seat; and there
is not the slightest doubt that had Parkiiill
hung on, he could have won it, with the re-
sultant emoluments and perquisites, by a
handsome margin. And, what is more, gone
on winning it. None of the holders of
Nationalist strongholds, such as Marks, of
Wentworth, could be induced to step aside
for their leader. Yet Hughes dared not
face Bendigo. It was in these circumstances
that Parkhill came to relinquish the prac-
tically certain reversion to about £3OOO, a
gold railway and tramway pass, and what-
ever other advantages, material and spiritual,
are included in an M.P.’s job. It may rea-
sonably be assumed, on all the evidence, now
available, that someone told Mr. Parkiiill
it would pay him to hand over his lien on
North Sydney to , Hughes. .Tire words, “a
"tenth of £25,000,” may not actually have
been uttered ; but in such matters of finance
a nod is as good as a wink to a seasoned
political organiser. That, however, by the
way: only one aspect of the case vitally
concerns the public. It is the same aspect
as that which casts such a mephit.c
atmosphere around the presentation to
the gentleman for whom Mr. Pair hill
effaced himself. The donors of Park-
]mi’s £2500 remain as shrinkingly anony-
mous as the persons who provided hugiifs’s
£25,000. There are reasons, entirely uncon-
nected with what might be termed the mathe-
matical symmetry which distinguishes the
two gifts, for concluding that they derive
from a common source. Assuming that
those who provided the Prime Minister with
his £25,000 expected some sort of quid pro
quo, they would not, as business men, spoil
the ship for a ha’porth of tar; or, to put
it in another way, they would not see their
£25,000 craft founder in sto.my Bendigo
when another £2500 might enable it to float,
perhaps for three or four Parliaments, in
peaceful North Sydney. That is how men
would argue who had paid the Prime Min-
ister a large sum in anticipation of favors
to come; and if such men exist, and if such
a situation lias been created, it is only
natural that all parties should be reticent
on the discreditable subject. If, on the other
hand, it is not so, if both Mr. Hughes and
Mr. PARKhill have come by their respective
fortunes oil honorable lines and from dis-
interested sources, then it is their duty to
the public, no less than to themselves, to
clear the matter up in the only way it can
be cleared up. At present the thing is giving
Nationalism the atmosphere of a boneyard.
«
Profitable Altruism.
An atmosphere of disingenuity has settled
upon “Pussyfoot” Johnson, now in Maori-
land, which should considerably discount his
value to the Cold-tea cause. He announced
both in England and in Australia that he
was “not being paid a threepenny-bit for
his services”; and he affirmed in Sydney that
he was in this hemisphere not to preach
prohibition, but as a patriot—to answer slan-
ders on his native land uttered by anti-prolii-
bitionists. Also, he mentioned that he did
not intend to preach prohibition in M.L.,
and in any case was merely passing through
the place. At a recent meeting at Dunedin,
one of a series that he has been holding,
allegedly out of sheer interest in the wel-
fare of the natives, the following episode
occurred. —
At the conclusion of Mr. Johnson’s address ques-
tions were invited. Of the claimants for a' hearing
Mr. A. Pa ape prevailed. He said that Mr. Johnson
had stated that he. had not received one threepenny-
bit from Maoriland. He had overheard a conversa-
tion in the hall that night between Mr. D. 0., Cam-
eron, the Rev. Mr. Raise and a lady, and he
heard the question asked: “Why not get the chair-
man to announce . that Mr. Johnson is, getting
£2OOO and his expenses?” Mr. Paape said he
would like to know who was telling the
Cameron and Mr. Raine or Mr. Johnson.
Messrs. Cameron and Raine, who are John-
sonites, wore incensed at this disclosure, but
they made no denials. In fact, according to
the* Dunedin Evening Standard, "the Rev.
K. Raine had heard that Mr. Johnson re-
ceived £lOOO a month, and then somebody
said it was £2OOO a month”; and Mr. Cam-
eron “had heard the rumor that it was £2OOO
a month, and that this was being circulated
to Mr. Johnson’s detriment.” Eventually,
after “a voice” had inquired, “Well, who
does pay him to come here?” and after Mr.
Cameron had shouted, “You go and find
out,” and after Mr. Harcoußt, of the M.L.
Alliance, had observed apologetically, “He
does not live on air” (as though this was
any answer to the charge that the apostle was
being paid £2OOO a year !), the unpleasantness
was allowed to drop. It had been previously
suggested (and denied) that Johnson was
under contract to draw his £45 a week right
up to polling-day. At Timaru he broke the
news for the first time that he was not alto-
gether a bird of passage. In fact, he re-
marked, “I expect I shall stay here till the
poll is taken. I did not intend to remain so
long, but if I go now some will be saying
that I ran out, and I’m not of the
runaway sort.” A man who is able
to juggle with facts and the lan-
guage in that adroit fashion can hardly
expect to be taken seriously as a witness of
truth in regard to what is happening abroad,
where his assurances, etc., can’t be tested.
Clearly he is not a witness at all. What
he is is a hired counsel for the prose-
cution of alcohol; one who has no other
calling, and who depends for the retention of
liis extremely lucrative job on the results
that he gets by bull-dozing his juries^—in
the present case the electors of M.L. He is
perfectly justified, of course, in earning a
living on such lines, but when he claims to
be speaking impartially, and to be actuated
merely by a desire to benefit his fellows, he
arouses the same derision as Blank, K.C.,
would if he had the effrontery to make a
similar claim in connection with a fat fee
over a burglary matter.
Housing Conditions in the Backblocks.
“Jacaranda” holds forth :
It must be quite five years since an article appeared
in The Bulletin pointing out that “there was a
great and joyous room in Australia for a union of
cockies’ wives.” The suggestion was made by
way of criticism of the dwellings which are mis-
called homes in many of, the country parts of Aus-
tralia. At that time Governor-General Munro-
Ferousos was offering prizes for plans of buildings

to house returned soldiers and other settlers on the
land. Nothing came of the scheme, but the subject
has lately been revived in Brisbane by a visitor
from London possessed of town-planning enthusiasms.
Describing the numbeis of house-hungry people who
flocked to see the recent London exhibition of prize-
winning home designs, this reformer mentioned that
the price of admission had to be doubled in order to
reduce the crowds who wanted to get in—and even
then the place remained overcrowded. Clear evi-
dence, this, of an interest that might easily be
awakened in the Commonwealth, where it is so badly
needed.
The late Thomas Mein wiiaith said, after a visit to
Canada, that if the people of Australia would only
spend half the money in keeping themselves and their
houses cool that people in other places were com-
pelled to spend in keeping themselves warm, our
northern regions would rank amongst the finest and
most healthful climates in the world. And in Eng-
land, only the other day, Beatrice Qrimshaw pub-
licly commiserated with a race which has to spend
a third of its income in warming and lighting its
homes; and she remarked on how favorably life
in New Guinea compared with such con-
ditions. Now, to most people, Australia —even
the outback northern portion of it —is as tar
ahead of New Guinea as a climatically desirable
place of residence as New Guinea is similarly ahead
of England in the mind of the enthusiastic authoress.
It takes a lot of telling to make some folk grasp
a fact which those with experience are constantly
repeating—-namely, that it is the conditions of life,
and not the climate, that are hindering that greatly-
increased white settlement which is now so generally
aiknowledged as being of vital necessity to Northern
Australia. At the Queensland Country Women’s Con-
ference, which Lady Forster opened the other day,
it was made quite clear that the up-country women
are getting very tired of galvanised-iron shacks and
other equally unsuitable forms of housing conditions.
One medical woman said that she agreed with Jack
London that galvanised-iron was the curse of Austra-
lia. This deadly building material found but one
advocate —a man, who contended that it was most
suitable on account of its durability, cheapness, easi-
ness of transport and quick-cooling qualities at
night. Another male, however, who has had 23
years’ experience in the Cape York district of Queens-
land, offered the opinion “that to approve of a build-
ing which was liable to exhaust its inmates during the
day and in which a siesta was next to impossible,
merely because it cooled rapidly at night, was but a
miserable and dangerous compromise.” For some
unknown reason stone and pise houses are not popu-
lar in North Queensland. They are said to retain
dampness in wet weather, and, after a couple of
months’ hot weather, to be unbearable at night. It
lias been suggested that these drawbacks are due,
not to a defect in the materials used, but to defective
use of them in construction. One outcome of this
particular conference, therefore, will be an inquiry
into the methods of building, ventilation, insulation,
etc., that have been proved successful in other
places where stone and pise houses are used.
Arrangements have also been made for a number of
temperature charts to be prepared during the coming
summer. These are to illustrate the varying con-
ditions in already existing dwellings, and will pro-
vide authentic data as to the advantages of some
houses and the defects of others. * The women have
decided that the Public Health Association, Town
Planners, Geographical Society, architects, or any
one at all that is supposed to know anything about
housing conditions as they should be are to be
given no rest until they shall have evolved some
method of housing the wayback people so that they
may live in comfort and health.
We hear constantly about how wonderful the
pioneers were who went away to the interior, where
white people had never been before. Women with
little children made shift with a tent till a grass-
house was built, followed by a mud-house, and eventu-
ally soared to the crowning glory of a wooden or gal-
vanised-iron home. r rhe next generation must be softer
than their forebears, say city residents, when they
hear of new settlers asking for something better.
There are quite a lot of things, though, that were
considered suitable and proper 50 years ago that
are clearly impossible to-day. Civilisation is sup-
posed to be advancing all the time. Certainly the
comforts and attractions of the city have multi-
plied since the days of our pioneer settlers out of
all proportion to the necessities of country people,
and more especially the women. It is not to be
wondered, therefore, that they have wakened enough
to ask that some of the benefits of the city shall be
taken to them in their lonely places, and one of
the first and most reasonable of these is that they
shall have houses suited to semi-tropical conditions.
If the ideals of “White Australia!” aro to be re-
tained, the conditions of life in outhack places
must be made attractive and healthy for white
women, and if the Country Women’s Associations
persist until they secure the knowledge of suitable
and economical methods of housing, and then take
steps to broadcast that knowledge, their organisa-
i ion -will not have been formed in vain.

The Bureau of Comic Imbecility.
The Hughes Government is given to brag-
ging of its benevolent regard for the exten-
sion of commerce and the application 'of
science to industry. When challenged to
produce evidence of this fostering care it
points proudly to the existence of the Bureau
of Commerce and Industry, an absurd insti-
tution in which a director, a secretary, a
commercial assistant, a chief clerk, a records
clerk, four typistes, a telephonist and a mes-
senger do futile things at Melbourne. It
is suggested that the mere fact of the direc-
tor and his flock of clerks and typistes being
supported by the taxpayers is proof of the
Government’s enthusiasm for shoving trade
along and establishing new industries by
encouraging invention and scientific research.
Meanwhile, there is an accumulation of facts
like the following :
During the war a factory was started in Brisbane
to manufacture acetate of lime and high explosives.
Among other things it conducted some valuable
experiments in the production of power alcohol from
molasses, turning out an article which was pro-
nounced excellent by those who tested it in Govern-
ment internal-combustion engines. But the war
ended, the experiments were discontinued, and the
factory was put out of action. Incidentally, a river
of molasses, sufficient for the production of millions
of gallons of power alcohol, has been poured into
the sea.
A Bundaberg (Q.) distillery found itself with a
surplus of rum. Scenting possibilities in power alcohol,
it approached the Government, but the latter discour-
aged the project, remarking, “Keep on making rum.”
The rum-makers kept on until they had enough rum
on hand to supply the whole Commonwealth for
three years. Then they turned their attention to
manufacturing methylated spirit, the supply of which
soon exceeded the demand. Going back on their
tracks, they talked power alcohol again and were
met with another official objection—people might
drink the stuff. It has taken about a year to get
the bureaucracy to accept a formula that will pro-
tect the public from its imaginary craving for
alcohol in the crude state and give the manufac-
turers a prospect of selling their commodity at a
profit. Meantime, prodigious quantities of molasses
have been chucked into the sea.
A forest-products laboratory was established in
Westralia. The staff consisted of 11 scientists, all
DOING HIS BIT.
“Mr Weaver, M.L.A., of N. S. Wales, returned to his attack oq soldier settlers last week.” -News item.
THE SLAVE TO DUTY: “What! I ought to he ashamed of putting the hoot into him!
Lord, man, I'm proud of it!"
highly-qualified, and their researches were extremely
interesting and important. One of their achieve-
ments was the manufacture of newsprint from, Aus-
tralian hardwoods. But just when their work was
at its most promising stage the order came, that the
staff had to be cut down to one man and two boys,
and the factory transferred from Perth to Melbourne.
The Government, it transpired, had been bitten hy
a rage for economy—it had just appointed three
new taxation officials at £l5OO per annum apiece
(Bbuce, the Treasurer, recently adiintted that they
hadn’t done a tap of work for months), and wanted
to save money somehow.
There is no mention of these matters in the
arid wilderness of figures and platitudes that
the Bureau of Commerce and Industry calls
its aniiuai report. The latest effort in that
line runs to 253 pages, and at least 233
of them represent a wooden-headed fooling-
away of public money. Twenty-five pages
consist of extracts from a U.S. report on
the elimination of waste —in industry, not
in administration —33 pages are devoted to
the trade imports of places like Singapore and
Hong Kong, and there are 45 pages of re-
marks by Little, the Government Trade
Commissioner in China, to the effect that
“China is the land of the blue cotton
gown,” and “I have seen forests, in Yunnan,
which were being burnt,” and “the staple
meat diet of the people is the flesh of the
hog.” What a comfort it is to know that,
while scientific research withers and indus-
trial experimenters are frigidly discouraged,
the director, the secretary, the commercial
assistant, the two clerks, the four typistes,
the telephonist and the messenger are still
getting paid for shuffling about in the
Bureau of Comic Imbecility.
Legal Aid in N.S.W.
“D.P.J.”: When the Poor Persons’ Legal
Remedies Act was passed in 1018, and an
appeal was sent out to both branches of the
legal profession to gratuitously assist per-
sons empowered to proceed under the Act,
it was thought that there would be a prompt
response. To handle “legal aid” cases might
well be considered a bounden duty by those
high up in the profession, a duty to be re-
garded in the same light as an honorary
position on a hospital staff by members of
the medical profession. Indeed, it is so
regarded in England and the U.S. The
profession, in N. S. Wales, however,
failed to rise to the occasion. Not a
K.C. submitted his name ; with a few excep-
tions, the shining lights of the Outer Bar
fought shy, and only a comparatively small
number of solicitors consented to act. After
a while one Gent. One after another had his
name withdrawn. Only a few names are
now left on the list —those of struggling
beginners, with a small sprinkling of the
more charitably-inclined old hands. The
effect of this state of affairs may be easily
imagined. A case involving intricate ques-
tions of law is handed to a raw and inexperi-
enced barrister; the case goes on appeal to
the Supreme Court, or even to the High
Court; a leader is briefed by the other side.
The position is almost hopeless for the “poor
person,” In such a case zealous, energy is
of no avail against, experience. Yet the
mischief is not irremediable. The,fault lies,
not with the system of legal aid (it works
efficiently in other countries), but with the
method of its application and the lack of
public spirit on the part of the profession.
The Act should be amended to provide for
the granting of costs to the successful party
—costs to be borne by the Department in the
event of a judgment against the “poor per-
son.” If such an amendment were passed,
there would soon be dozens of barristers and
solicitors handling cases for the Department.
N. S. Wales’s Fuller Government was
given a mandate to be righteous: it does
not always pay, politically, however, to be
too righteous. These twin facts serve to
explain the futile raid made last Saturday
on the premises of 17 leading Sydney book-
makers. The date chosen was Victoria’s
Derby Day, when even a Sydney detective
of the humblest mental calibre might deduce
without unduly straining his intellect that
the principals of the offending concerns would
probably be in Melbourne; and the time
fixed for the stroke to fall was 12.45 p.m.,
when most of the principals’ understudies
would, in the nature of things, either be
having lunch at Moorefield or Ivembla
Grange (where the first races started at
m- 30 r.lv° r theil ‘, wa y there by train
CfU : a /^ 1S was why the money seized
amounted to a whole £400—23 pounds sterl*
mg and some odd shillings per leviathan!
fco tar as the telegram and telephone busi-
ness was concerned-it is enough to mention
that the police planned the raid at the be-
ginning ot last month, and had actually had
a rehearsal m which 60 men participated.
If the leaders of the It ini didn’t know what
was being prepared for them in ample tiffin
to make all necessary arrangements to Soften
the blow, then their Intelligence Service is
not the efficient organisation it is commonlv
Understood to be, nor is their police liaison
in its Usual smooth-working order. Half-a-
dozen able-bodied and normally-intelligeht
men, if given carte blanche to 'clear every
bettmg-shop out of Pitt, King and Castle-
reagh streets, could do it, in a legal manner
inside a month; and, incidentally, the same
half-dozen—fortified with cars, firearms and
assistants for watching the exits, etc.
could with equal ease clean up tout-infested
spots like Centennial Park. But, apparently,
these are the last developments that the
Fuller crowd desire. They are profound
believers in the virtue of the elaborate but
meaningless gesture; ardent lovers of that
sound and fury which signify nothing what-
ever.
“Cartot” on the export of shoddy drugs:—
Would-be “smartness” on the part of one or two
Australian manufacturers is like to cost this country
another promising market. Before the war Germany
had almost a complete monopoly of the wholesale
drug trade of the East and the Straits Settlements,
especially in such commodities as quinine and acetyl-
salicylic acid, or aspirin, largely used in malarial
fever. When Germany lost her mercantile marine
Australian manufacturing chemists started to fill the
demand. Their products were pure and of excep-
tionally high quality, and before long they were
doing a big trade. But lately other manufacturers,
of a different type, have come upon the scene and
have been exporting chemicals which, while shouting
their purity on the label, have revealed themselves
as frauds when sampled. A recent shipment of
aspirin to Sourabaya proved to contain 10 per cent,
of free salicylic acid, making it not only useless but
dangerous, and bismuth carbonate has been found
adulterated with flour. Other shipments have been
badly packed and misdescribed, the result being that
merchants in the Straits have now become highly
suspicious of all goods bearing an Australian label.
And once the consumer in that quarter of the world
conceives a distrust of anything, he is most impar-
tial in his distribution of it. The remedy, obviously,
is better inspection of and better supervision over
all goods that leave the Commonwealth for export
overseas. The fruit situation ill England should
have been a sufficient lesson,
•
“Tatjwarra” : Senator LYNCH gives himselt
a cheap boost, and Australia a poor adver-
tisement, when he advises the Commonwealth
to abandon Papua, and invite some “friendly
Power*’ to take possession of what should
be one of Australia’s most valuable national
assets. His chief grounds for dissatisfaction
appear to be that, during the last 15 years,
Australia has subsidised the local Govern-
ment to the extent of £500,000, and that
nothing has been done to justify such a con-
stant drain on the Federal Treasury. As a
matter of fact, in practically every import-
ant aspect of development, striking progress
was made from the date the Commonwealth
assumed control, in 1906, Until the unfore-
seen collapse of prices at the end of 1920.
The value of exports increased from £64,000
to £271,000; imports—mostly from Austra-
lia—from £BB,OOO to £423,000 ; local revenue,
from £22,000 to £86,000, and the area of
plantations from 1400 to 62,000 acres. These
figures deal with only one aspect of Aus-
tralian rule, but the results achieved in
other directions have been equally impres-
sive. Under Commonwealth control the
native population is slowly but steadily in-
creasing ; Brown Brother has been taught to
cultivate his land and market his products;
a large area, formerly a “terra incognita,”
has been brought under effective control;
tribal warfare, the bane of all earlier admin-
istrations, is being rigorously suppressed,
and cannibalism, even in the outlying parts,
is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. On
these grounds alone, Australia has surely
demonstrated her ability to successfully
govern a backward race. As for the miser-
able half-million about which Senator
Lynch is so concerned, every penny has been
returned to Australian merchants in pay-
ment for goods supplied. During the last
two years progress has been retarded
through no fault of the Administration or
of the harassed planters who have invested
their capital in the country. In these days
of financial stringency and commercial de-
pression it comes as a shock to hear respon-
sible public men openly advocating the hand-
ing over of this valuable territory to the
mercenary Yank, especially wh a a simple
amendment of the Navigation Act would
speedily resuscitate Papua’s 'anguishing in-
dustries. Lynch modestly claims that the
idea of advertising to the world Australia’s
impotence to carry out its obligations under
the Papua Act is “entirely his own.” He
surely does not think that any sensible per-
son is going to dispute it.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Mention of a certain £25,000, at Too-
woomba (Q.), enabled Littleton Groom to
weigh in with the Great Thought of the
week: —
That £25,000, or whatever it was, was the gift
of men who gave it out of their own pockets as an
appreciation of a man who had rendered a great
service to his country. That man sacrificed health,
position, everything for his country.
“Everything” is immense.
By retiring, fed-up, from the Westralian
Labor party, J. J. Simons, M.L.A., has
reduced that hapless remnant to 15 members
in a House of 50. Simons stuck to the party
in its darkest days, and fought two hard
elections before he got in for East Perth last
year. But he gave mortal offence at the
Trades Hall by refusing to crawl to the
ruling clique. When, his newspaper, the
Call, was dragged into the Perth news-
paper strike, although the Call comps, had
no quarrel with Simons, his enemies per-
emptorily ordered him to give an account of
himself. He replied with his resignation,
coupled with some brisk remarks about
“Borneo head-hunters.” The worst dis-
abilities a modern Labor politician can have
are brains and a backbone. Simons has
both. Exit Simons.
Cocks, the N. S. Wales Treasurer, pro-
fesses to have done away with the super-
tax on income?, but the abolition' is more
apparent than real. Actually, the super
rate of 6d. in the £ has been blended with
the general rates and a few small conces-
sions have been granted to the middle class,
who furnish 90 per cent, of the revenue from
taxation; with these exceptions the new tax
is very like the old. It begins at Is. in
the £, and works up to 2s. 3d. on indi-
viduals and 2s. 6d. (the same old 2s. 6d.)
on companies. The Victorian tax on com-
panies is Is. in the f. Under the Common-
wealth and State income-taxes, as recently
“revised,” N.S.W. companies will pay 4s.
lid. in the £; Victorian companies 3s. sd.
in the £. That Is. Gd. expresses the differ-
ence between tolerably sane and utterly rot-
ten finance.
In submitting the agreement for the con-
struction of four Murray bridges and rail-
ways to Vic. Assembly, Railway Minister
Sam Barnes, who was well saturated with
his subject, described it as the death-warrant
of provincialism. Sam is over-enthusiastic.
Never again, the optimist proceeded, would
political boundaries be allowed to interfere
with the development of the country along
natural lines. Samuel will know better as
he grows older. However, the exuberant
Barnes put his heart into his speech, and it
produced a visible impression. There will be
some growling, but the bargain will be rati-
fied. Which bargain is one of the results of
the New-States movement.
“Rienzi” : John Livingston, who has been
outed in the Liberal pre-selection for Barker
(S.A.), will be greatly missed if he loses
his seat. An affable and kindly old Scotch-
man whose rare speeches sound like the
rumble of a train in a distant tunnel, he
always keeps his table merry and bright at
political dinners. On one famous occasion
he donned the kilts, and started to sing one
of those interminable Scawtch laments of
the “We Are Na Fou’ ” variety, which the
deceased painter, John Ford Paterson, used

Hieland tones were surpassed in melody by
Finlayson, the former member for Brisbane.
At one dinner a tew years ago Finlayson
gave some of Harry Lander’s best, and the
mellowness and roundness of his baritone
astonished the company.
Another augur reads the signs:—
If there is anything certain besides death and
taxes, it is that Hughes will lose his majority on
December 16. The expectation is that he will drop
eight seats at least, and perhaps 10. Among these
are Denison (Tas.), Adelaide, lialgoorlie (W.A.) and
Capricornia (Q.). Bendigo is a toss-up between
Jowett, of the Country party, and the Labor man.
Livingston has lost his pre-selection for Barker
(S.A.) and the seat goes Liberal. Watt is now
definitely Liberal, and Oxley (Q.), for which Bayley
sits, may go Labor on account of the redistribution.
In addition Rodgers is going to have a tough fight
in Wannon (Vic.). Some of Hughes’s lukewarm sup-
porters may turn Liberal after the House meets, but
there may not be enough of them to give a working
majority to a Liberal-Country coalition. There
remains a possible Nationalist-Country amalgama-
tion, and the olive branch is still being held out.
The obstacle is Hughes himself, but there is talk now
of Billy being deposed. It has been spoken of fre-
quently before. Now there is a real reason. It
looks like a coalition Ministry with Massy Greene
as Prime Minister and a fair sprinkling of the
Country party in the Cabinet.
Undaunted by the obstacles thrown in its
way when he introduced it, Vic. Treasurer
McPherson stuck to his Charities Control
Bill, and managed to pilot it through the
Assembly. Therein he succeeded where
Turner, Watt and Peacock (who were Pre-
miers, as well as Treasurers) failed. In-
stead of a director presiding over the board
of control, there will be an inspector (at
£lOOO a year), and the board will elect its
own chairman. That was the concession
Mac made to his critics, and it doesn’t
amount to much.
Exercising the authority granted at the
Ballarat conference, the Vic. Cocky party
is taking country townspeople, or as many
of them as care to join, into its fold. It
labels itself the United Country party, and
has adopted the platform of the Federal
C.P. Some of the country Liberals are
expected to come in. If they do the Farm-
ers’ party will be in process of becoming
in Vic. what it is in W.A. —the strongest
group in the State Assembly.
J. E. Ogden, who has been in Speck poli-
tics for 16 years, has for the second time
resigned his State seat to run for the Senate.
If he again misses the Federal ’bus, it is
considered unlikely that he would have much
difficulty in climbing back to his old State
perch at the next attempt. But as that
event is normally nearly three years away,
and as the Darwin vacancy caused by his
resignation will be filled by the runner-up
on a recount of the votes' at last general
election (either A.W.U. official Phil Keyly
or L.V.A. official Len Bennett), the chances
are that unless Ogden reaches the Senate at
this try he will drop out of politics alto-
gether. Many things may happen to a man
in three years.
Hopeful item from the North:—
Darwin was visited recently by another industrial
cyclone. When the atmosphere had cleared, it was
found that the North Australian Industrial Union
had been whirled away from the wharves and
that all the work was in the hands of the N.T.
Workers’ Union, known to the local Reds as the
“Wobblers.” As a result of the dust-up, cargo is
now unloaded at the rate of 20 tons per hour, (old
rate 8 tons), cartage and shipping costs have been
reduced 2s. 6d. per ton, and there have been no
strikes, go-slows or stop-work meetings for weeks.
The excuse made for the old leisurely rate of unload-
ing was the awkward shape of the jetty, and the
right-angled turn, which renders a turntable neces-
sary, with consequent double handling of all cargo.
With the same jetty, the same turntable and the
same double-handling, 21 tons are shifted for
every ton that was shifted under the old disorder
of things. But different men are in charge. The
Marella, on her last trip, brought 400 tons of cargo.
She tied up at 6 a.m., and two hatches were worked
for unloading. One hatch crew finished at 7 p. m.,
the other at 11 p. m., a record speed for the N.T.
It really looks as if the I Won’t Worker has come to
the dead finish in Darwin.
“Wad” : Lee, the Tas. Treasurer, professes to
abhor all gambling and gambling institutions,
from two-up to the tote and Tattersall’s,
but his Government is not too proud to
accept sustenance from Tattersall’s to the
extent of about 25 per cent, of the total
revenue from taxation. Last year the income-
tax produced £355,000, of which sum prize-
winners in Tatt.’s paid £98,000. In addi-
tion, stamp-tax and other imposts collected
through Tatt.’s amounted to £70,000. Be
tween them Tatt.’s and the tote yielded
£200,000 —more than twice the amount of
land-tax; or 16s. per head of population.
The Government deplores the necessity of
taking this tainted money, but keeps on
taking it.
“Gallery”: Hughes seems to have lost his
gift for coining effective epithets. Launch-
ing a small broadside at the Liberals in
Victoria and S.A., he dubbed them “troglo-
dytes”—the mournful and moth-eaten term
which his hated opponent, Piddington, has
already employed once in this campaign.
Also, when a small mob interrupted the un-
even tenor of his platitudes at Horsham
(Vic.), he called them “hyenas and dingoes,”
which has a familiar ring, and added that
“they were in the same condition every
Saturday night.” This only serves to re-
mind one how urbane and humorous George
Reid was under similar criticism. Reid was
too diplomatic to make a hostile minority
more unbearable by returning insult for in-
sult. At one of his meetings in Victoria an
interrupter declared him “a blob.” This
comment would have started Hughes shout-
ing for the police, but Reid merely drew
himself up in a mock affectation of dignity
and replied : “I can hardly call you a gentle-
man. No gentleman would reveal a man’s
dearest secret to strangers.”
Deficient as it is in other branches of
knowledge, the Sydney A.L.P. has nothing
to learn about the art of making a virtue of
necessity. Impressive was the attitude it
struck in withdrawing from the contest in
North Sydney. Touchingly it referred to
the noble self-martyrdom of Tonge, the
Labor candidate; proudly it discoursed on
its own unselfishness in letting Piddington
box-on without interruption. So grand was
this gesture of generosity that it seems
almost brutal to mention that North Sydney
would have been an expensive election to
fight, and that, having scared away some of
the capitalists who used to contribute to its
war chest, the party hasn’t two spare six-
pences to rub against one another. Also, that
the magnanimous Tonge stood for North
Shore in March and polled 63 No. 1 votes in
a total of 50,734.
Hughes made a strong attempt during his
Adelaide visit to strengthen the local Nation-
alists against the Liberals, who have dis-
solved partnership. Pearce, Bruce, Foster
and Poynton were over on the same job.
“A piebald Australia and low wages,” was
the. Priminister’s version of Barwell’s policy.
Barwell himself and Gunn, the Labor
leader, were equally busy throughout in
writing to the papers that practically every
statement made by Hughes was incorrect,
or at any rate misleading. The election will
be a thoroughly three-sided affair in the
central State, and the A.L.P. expects to
profit. But the indications are that the
Nats, and the Libs, hate it more than they
hate each other.
A union secretary’s version:—
There is a bit of history behind the miserable
collapse of the strike in the Sydney iron trade against
the 44-hour week. An attempt was made by the
howling dervishes who are trying to introduce
Sovietism into Australia to bluff the unions into
letting the Council of Action take charge of their
affairs, but it broke down completely when the
Bolshies’ bluff was called. Only a few unions responded
to the Council’s advances. The others were frankly
suspicious of it; and even the majority of those
who sent delegates refused to give them power to
pledge their organisations to any course of action or
monetary support. The attitude of the majority was
that if, as some of its advocates alleged, the Council
was a blameless body with no extreme intentions it
wasn’t of much use; and that if it wanted to secure
the power to raise any old rumpus it desired it was
asking too much. The Council asked the unions
for money, but only about 10,000 roubles (tup-
pence in Aussie currency) came in. Then the
Council issued what it described as a clarion call
to the workers to resist the return to 48 hours.
One of the organisations to whom the call
was addressed asked a question about strike pay.
There being no strike pay, nor even a smell of it,
the ironworkers’ assistants rushed . back to
work, and the Council of Action became a Council
of Mud. As to the five-day week, a lot of the workers
have found that it has cost them more in extra
spending-silver than the thing is worth. They are
almost as tired of the 44-hour week as they are of
the Council of Action and the pommy agitators who
created it.
THE MARTYR’S CROWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Arclidale Parkhill, who obligingly stood down
for the Prime Minister at North Sydney, has been
presented by his admirers with the sum of £2500
as a mark of appreciation for his self-sacrifice.”
The frown was on the Parkhill brow,
The tears were in his eyne,
Beneath his breath he hissed “The cow!”
(Or, possibly, “The swine!”)
Within his hands he hid his head,
Pie bit the Archdale lip.
“The blanky thing’s enough,” he said,
“To give a saint the pip.
At Bendigo he’s gone a treat,
So I must stand me down.
For Billy Hughes a cushy seat,
For me the martyr’s crown,”
He snarled,
“For mine the martyr’s crown!
“I hoped,” he growled, “to draw the pelf
That hangs to making laws;
But I must immolate myself,
They tell me, for the Cause.
Such sacrifices, it is true,
One’s country may exact,
But still it gallg a chap to do
The Quintus Curtius act.
My hardly-kindled light must dim
Lest checked be his renown;
It’s place and power and wealth for him,
For me the martyr’s crown,”
He groaned,
“My whack’s the martyr’s crown!
“So be it, then. My destined prize
Behold, I freely give.
Observe how Private Parkhill dies
That Marshal Hughes may live.
Away with self! Tis for his side
A sportsman plays the game;
A pleasant glow of virtuous pride
Already warms my frame.
No more I’ll fuss and fume and fret” —
A smile displaced his frown—
“But, comrades, kindly don’t forget
Who’s earned the martyr’s crown
For this.
Gimme my martyr’s crown!”
They brought the crown—so bad a fit
It hid the head from view.
They had to pad the thing a bit
Like cunning hatters do.
With rustling bonds they lined the bands
That go around the brow....
The patriot’s head, one understands,
Is somewhat easier now.
The fugitive from Bendigo
A refuge has wherein to throw
His harried carcase down.
And Archie, for a quid pro quo,
Acquires the martyr’s crown.
What ho!
The well-lined martyr’s crown!

“The Daugherty ruling, which the British shipping companies have taken up to the U.S. Supreme Court, is that foreign ships arriving in United States ports and having liquor on board, are liable to arrest and possibly to confiscation. On the other hand
the Government has ordered the release of the British schooner Emerald, which the American Government seized outside the three-mile limit. The Emerald’s liquor will be returned intact, and the American Government will send an apology."

Queensland State Government Insur-
ance Office. —-This office was established
six years ago and was given a monopoly of
Workmen’s Compensation insurance, which
was, by Act of Parliament, made compul-
sory. Shortly after establishment the office
launched out in other insurance business,
and in competition with 76 proprietaries it
seeks fire, marine and miscellaneous acci-
dent business, and is also rapidly develop-
ing a big life branch. The Workmen’s
Compensation department is, of course,
easily the largest. Last year its income
was £330,109, the Life branch gathered in
£204,594, and Fire income was £93,741.
Altogether, in its sixth year, the aggregate
income of the office exceeded £679,000.
Six years’ experience in t! o biggest depart-
ment has been as follows: —

Industrial depression and the tendency of
wages to decline affected latest premium
income, which was £l4Ol less than in the pre-
vious year. The outstanding feature of the
period was the very high claims rate. The
£221,498 losses shown in the table do not
give the full extent of claims. At the 1921
balance the Commissioner earmarked
£80,771 of reserves for claims outstanding
and expected. Besides the £221,498 actu-
ally paid during the 12 months to June 30,
at that date the Commissioner decided that
£132,479 —£51,708 more than 12 months
previously—was required for claims in
course of settlement. The claims experience
can be stated more satisfactorily in this
way: deducting the allowances for unsettled
claims at the opening of the accounting
period, last year’s ascertained losses were
approximately £356,000 compared with
£222,000 for 1921. That puts the figures in
the table in an entirely different light: the
£263,509 of reserves shown there include
the £132,000-odd which, when the accounts
were ruled off two months after the balanc-
ing date, was probably a fairly accurate esti-
mate of the liability on claims in course of
settlement at June 30. The year’s flosses,
paid and provided for, amounted to 85 2 p.c.
of premiums. The expenses of the depart-
ment, which pays no commission or taxa-
tion, worked out at 17.1 p.c. of premiums.
Comparisons with other years were: —

1920 .. 75.1 „ 15.5 „
1921 .. 70.3 „ 18.35 „
1922 .. 85.2 „ 17.1 „
The year’s accounts opened with a credit of
£13,407, but when the Commissioner had
made provision for claims in course of settle-
ment and expected, had reserved £4OOO
for “default assessments” and voted £5OOO
to a miners’ phthisis fund, the credit balance
had been reduced to £5031. Not taking the
miners’ subsidy into account, the year
showed a loss of £3376.
Though this result was due partly to the
Mt. Mulligan disaster —it cost the Office
£32,249 —the year’s claims rate, entirely dis-
regarding the disaster loss, was 75.3 p.c. of
premiums, which was the highest experi-
enced to date. Two years ago The Bulle-
tin questioned whether rates were not then
at bedrock. They were to have been re-
viewed last year, but the Commissioner had
doubts as to the future. On this occasion,
“on account of the high claims ratio experi-
enced,” he frankly states that a revision is
ndt advisable at present. An investigation
of last year’s operations would doubtless
show some profit-earning lines which would
justify reductions, but on the other hand
compensating increases would be necessary
in trades and industries in which premiums
have proved inadequate. Some adjustments
may be made later on, but The Bulletin
won’t be surprised if the Commissioner finds
it necessary, on the whole, to increase rather
than cut rates. The world-wide experience
with workmen’s compensation insurance has
shown a tendency for losses to increase as
legislation and regulations become more
generally understood: and this Queensland
State Office is apparently no exception to
the general rule. So far as the North-
ern policy-holder is concerned, this office
having been given a monopoly of all insur-
ances made obligatory by the Act, every-
thing depends on equitable rates and econo-
mical administration. A detailed examina-
tion of premiums and claims in a hundred
and one callings is necessary to decide
whether the tariff is all it should be in an
office whose function is to do business at
as near cost-price as possible. Expenses,
however, are certainly not low. Consider-
ing that insurance is compulsory and that
employers are compelled to lodge returns and
are liable to fine if they default, an expense
ratio of 17.1 p.c. is high. In fact, it is
double the rate of some southern co-opera-
tive offices with comparatively small pre-
mium incomes and whose shareholding-
policv-holders have frequently to be chased
for their business. But, as The Bulletin
has remarked on other occasions, there is
some doubt whether this big department of
the State Office has not been carrying some
costs which should more properly have
been charged to other branches. For in-
stance, in the Life section exes, have been
smaller than could reasonably have been
expected in so youthful an enterprise.
Including the provision for claims in course
of settlement, the Workmen’s Compensation
branch accounts show reserves totalling
£147,733. In the table they figure at
£263,509, which includes £115,776 of accu-
mulated profit which The Bulletin has
kept track of from year to year as it has
been voted into the general reserve fund of
the Office.
The Miners’ Phthisis Department is
another section where the Commissioner last
year found income inadequate to cover out-
go. Premiums and interest contributed
£14,959 for the 12 months ended June 30,
and a subsidy of £5OOO was voted from pro-
fits of the Workmen’s Compensation branch.
But after tapping general reserves for
£7728 to provide for claims in course of
settlement, the branch closed its accounts
with a debit of £494 in place of a credit of
£5609 with which the year opened.

Everything was looking so bright 24 years
ago that paid capital was increased
from £75,000 to £lOO,OOO by an issue of
shares at par. New timber interests were
taken up, milling and joinery equipment was
added to, and some of the nev7 capital was
required to enable the co. to carry adequate
stocks at the higher values ruling. But
profits for the past two years were smaller
in relation to funds than for any other
period recorded in the introductory table.
In the 1921 financial year a fall in prices
consequent on large importations necessi-
tated a revision of stock values. Trade
slackened also, and when the accounts were
made up profits represented only 5 p.c. on
capital. The directors decided to pay a 74
p.c. div., so reserves were tapped for £2435.
Trading conditions did not improve last
year: general depression and doubts as to
future property values affected turnover, and
the margin of profit on individual sales was
probably also smaller. Only 4| p.c. was
earned on capital. Nevertheless the direc-
tors declared a 6 p.c. div., which has cut
into reserves for £1472 more. Consequently
in two years £3907 of accumulated profit has
been taken to give shareholders an average of
6| p.c.
The directors are expecting better results
for the current year; but the co.’s principal
trouble appears to be that it is over-equipped
with both timber-properties and plant for
present market demands. Balance-sheet
comparisons follow :

Investments .. 4,000 3,5°0 2,500 3,3')
Cash, deposits, etc. 939 3,683 876 870
The feature of that table is that though
numerous additions have been made to fixed
assets since 1914 their book value is now
only £2302 larger, and during the past year
vessels and punts alone increased £B3OO.
These figures suggest that assets have been
well written-doWn, but whether the provi-
sion was more than ample is known only to
those inside. Anyway, the dividend record
does not indicate that the co. has had many
opportunities of putting much up its sleeve.

Arthur Cocks and Co.’s headquarters are
in Sydney, and there are branches in Mel-
bourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Wellington.
The Queensland and Maoriland branches
were floated into separate cos., and interests
therein are included in the parent’s
balance-sheet as shares in other cos. £11,550,
debentures £20,000. When the 1921
accounts were made up and gave £4813 in
excess of the amount required for 10 p.e.
on ordinaries, the directors “believed that
they had made sufficient provision for a
falling market.” But values continued to
decline, and dollar exchange also affected
the stock-sheets. The co. was also put to
expense in shifting headquarters to the free-
hold premises purchased a couple of years
ago, and owing to alterations to these pre-
mises, portion of which is being leased,
this asset did not help income. These hap-
penings and the writing-down of stocks,
trading on a smaller margin of profit, and
the absence of interest and divs. from asso-
ciated cos., resulted in the co. showing a
smaller profit than at any other balance
since the business was passed over to a
public co. 11 years ago. But as a substan-
tial P. and L. credit had been brought for-
ward from 1921, and the co. was fairly com-
fortable, the directors decided to pay ordi-
naries 74 p.c. for the year. This has cut
into reserves for £6842, reducing them to
£11,023. Shareholders have, therefore, not
suffered much as a result of the adverse
period, and the rate of div. declared. is
worth a trifle more owing to the capitalisa-
tion of £9816 of reserves last year, that
amount having been used to pay up a new
issue to 6s. Bd. This distribution was also
considered “opportune” because at the time
a hungry Treasurer was alleged to have
planned a raid on cos. paying divs. exceed-,
ing a certain rate. “Arco” shareholders are
no longer concerned about that threat: man-
aging-director Arthur Cocks is nowadays
State Treasurer!

Comparisons of individual entries are now
not of much value owing to the establish-
ment of subsidiary cos. A notable feature
of the latest accounts, however, was that
at July 31 stocks and all interests m other
cos. were less than the book value of stocks
alone 12 months previously. When the co.
began £12.000 was naid (in shares) for
goodwill, but in 11 years £33,683 of Surplus
profit has been accumulated, and the whole
of paid capital, including the £9SI6 trans-
ferred two years ago. is nowadays repre-
sented by tangible assets and supported by
genuine reserves of £11,023 if there is no
goodwill in the subsidiary concerns.

Fifteen years ago this building co. found
difficulty in paying 6 p.c. divs.; but though
two years ago capital was increased one-
third "by a bonus issue, the management now
pays 8 p.c. with ease. Still, the reserve
transfer was hardly a “bonus” issue. There
were re-adjustments after the ’nineties
smash; capital was reduced, but assets were
not written down. The amount clipped
from capital was placed in a contingency re-
serve, which was drawn upon as losses were
made on realisation of old assets. By 1920
the management decided that it had seen the
last of its old troubles, and £31,522 then
remain’ng in the contingency fund, together
with £2945 of other reserves, was replaced
in the share ledger. Almost £BO.OOO of fore-
closures were unloaded in the previous 20
years, and prices proved much better than
had been anticipated. Meanwhile the lend-
ing connection was being built up again, and
there are now advances with a book value
of £189,497 compared with £51,119 only a
dozen years ago. Balance-sheet movements
since 1915 are shown in this comparison :

Deposit and overdraft interest took £8921,
working expenses £2288, and £3166 was paid
away in land and income taxes, leaving a
net profit of £12,364, £3OO of which has been
reserved for taxes. Liabilities are steadily
growing larger, but creditors are well pro-
tected : capital and reserves, after payment
of the final div., totalled £162,335; all lia-
bilities amounted to £91,540. Put another
way: to back £81,038 of debt not covered by
gilt-edged investments there were advances

When it began almost 20 years ago the co.
borrowed £9OOO from the State Savings
Bank. Including £lOOO paid off last year,
the mortgage has been reduced by only
£3OOO. Meantime, though, the model
lodging-house has given shareholders good
divs. On this occasion they get 12i p.c. on
£18,200, of which £2730 was accumulated
profit transferred a couple of years ago. The
surplus of liquid assets over and above the
final div. and bonus amounted to only £25,
and liabilities, including the mortgage, ex-
ceeded that by £6082. Considering the many
.years’ run of good profits, the directors have
been rather slow in freeing the business of
outside financing. Possibly the Savings Bank
loan is too sweet to lose, but considering how
well the co. has done over a long period,
the building up of larger liquid assets would
have been no hardship.

This young insurance office did not call in
a brass band to help it write its first poli-
cies ; it was content to start with an assured
small and healthy-looking business instead
of opening up branches everywhere and pro-
ceeding to hustle with old-established cos.
for policies in an attempt to justify costs of
establishment. Its promoter, 11. B. Car-
penter, an old Queensland Insurance officer
whose brothers had been island-trading and
agenting for foreign insurance cos. for many
years, started by inviting a few friends to
join him in putting up the necessary capital.
No prospectus was issued, and the promoter
asked no consideration, either in cash or
shares. The first year closed with £22,200
of paid capital; at September 30 last
it had been increased to £24,750, and the
whole of it was represented by best-quality
investments. In the first year gross pre-
miums totalled £14.923; for the past 12
months £22,890. Underwriting performances
have been as follows :

1922.. 12,893 7129 3416 55.3 „ 26.5 „
The Australian Traders’ shared the general
experience of heavier losses last year: never-
theless, there was an underwriting profit oi
18.2 p.c. For each of the two years 8 p.c.
divs. have been paid, and a credit of £971
remained at Profit and Loss after £5158 —
40 p.c. of the year’s net premiums—had been
reserved for unexpired risks. Incidentally,
interest from investments last year provided
£1691 of the div. At Sept. 30 there were
assets totalling £40,769, made up of £14,286
of Government securities, short-call loans,
cash, etc.. £22.662 and £3821 of book debts.
All establishment costs were charged against
the first year’s revenue, and no value is
placed on office equipment or stationery in'
the published accounts. The Australian
Traders’ is one of the healthiest-looking
youngsters in the Australian insurance
family.

“Anode”: Members of the Australian In-
stitute of Mining and Metallurgy recently
foregathered at Port Pine for the annual
meeting. For the majority the Barrier was
responsible, and the unanimous conclusion
was that no matter what arguments pro and
con were brought to bear on the question of
smelting in Australia as against overseas, it
would be a calamity to allow the magnificent
plant of Associated Smelters to be scrapped.
The technical men connected with this huge
business have done some remarkable things
on the engineering and metallurgical side
during the past few years. The whole pro-
cess lias been turned inside out. Broken
Hill slime-concentrate, always heavily penal-
ised by buyers in pre-war days on account of
alleged smelting difficulties, is treated as
easily as the coarser lead. Ironstone has
been practically cut out of the job. Slag
handling arrangements have been radically
altered. The old messy, expensive business
of running the pots of molten slag out to the
dump, to there solidify in one hard mass,
has been replaced by a clean, new method.
The. slag; from the blast furnaces is run
straight into a stream of salt water which,
comes from the jackets of the furnace. This
causes the slag to break into small nodules
about the size of peas, permitting of elevat-
ing and automatic loading into trucks and
thence to storage. The slag contains about
22 p.c. to 25 p.c. zinc oxide, and experi-
ments are well in hand for recover-
ing this metal. There is no doubt
European smelters would gladly buy
the high-grade granular concentrate from
Broken Hill, but what would become of all
the other lower grade and refractory stuff?
There is a lot of 40 p.c. to 50 p.c. lead con-
centrate —slimy stuff with a fairly high zinc
tenor—which the German, at any rate, would
only buy with stiff penalties.
* *■ * *
B. H. Block 10 made another shilling call
recently, but as the Misima proposition has
been left to the white ants —temporarily, at
any rate —probably the burden on the scrip-
holders will be lightened somewhat, as the
parent co. has had to pay calls on a block
of over 100,000 shares in the island gold
show. Four more calls of a shilling each
will make Block 10 shares fully paid up, and
the problem of reconstruction or some other
alternative will have to be faced. There does
not seem to be much likelihood of resump-
tion of operations on profitable lines at
Broken Hill under existing conditions, and
there is little sign of any move to secure an
award which would improve things for the
cos.
* * * #
Block 14, which is in the same stable, is
also in low water financially; and the pro-
blem of raising money would be difficult, on
account of the preference issue. The pre-
ference holders not only get their money
back on a liquidation, with accumulated in-
terest, but whack up the balance of assets
on a fifty-fifty basis with the ordinaries.
Several months ago the Sulphide Corp. was
invited to make a cash offer for both pro-
perties—but evidently the price didn’t suit.
* * * *
Broken Hill cos. have been very unfortu-
nate in their speculations away from the
Hill. Block 14 Torrington (N.S.W.), which
was equipped for working on an extensive
scale, and which was expected to be a profit-
able producer of tin, wolfram and bismuth,
was a failure from the start; on sampling it
was a low-grade proposition which could
only be made to pay on a large output at low
cost; on recovery it was hopeless. The Kings-
gate, near Glen Innes, a multi-metal mine
which had earned a big reputation when run
as private concern, might have survived
h..d anything like war-prices for molybdenum
been maintained. King Island Scheelite
paid a few divs. during the period of wax-
values, but, like the others, it closed down
when the slump arrived. The greatest
disappointment of all is the Block 10 Misima
gold-mine (Papua).
* * * •
John Brandon’s Block 10 Misima has had
another rake over. A. W. Wincey cut down
O. B. Ward and Reg Williamson’s esti-
mates of ore in sigbt, and now Bullfinch A.
L. Hay reduces Wincey’s 117,506 tons of
335. material to 62,250 tons of 30s.
5.4 d. ore. The cruel cut is the leaving out
of 19.000 tons of 465. 3d. stone at No. 2 level
south, and the reducing of 16,250 tons at
No. 2 north averaging 375., to 14,120 tons
worth 28s. 3d. The directors take this pill
much more tractably than when Wincey
swept up ; they explain that the excision of
oi*e arises from blocks which have to be kept
standing to assure the safety of the mine.
During the past six months Hay sent
26,750 tons of 28s. lid. ore to the battery.
He got costs down from 355. to 265.
9|d. a ton, and showed a working profit of
£llBl, but when scrapped plant had to be
written off a net loss of £4997 resulted. The
debit at P. and L. now amounts to £47,568,
which is a lot more than can ever be got out
of the ore now available for the mill. Hay
experienced wet weather and bad conditions
undergi-ound, and the difficulty of sorting out
suitable grades of ore kept output low. The
plant was stopped and a dash made to get
No. 3 level opened up; but cash cut out and
the whole bag of tricks was closed. Only
enough hands are on the pay list to keep the
plant sale. Some of the old crowd, wanting
to get the mine on tribute, were given a curt
refusal. Thus is verified old B.H. Block 10
chairman Mcßryde’s prediction that it was
wise to get out when the co. began hunting
the golden calf of Misima.

“Peter”: Opposition is growing towards
the granting of extensive areas to oil cos.
in Westralia. From speeches by some mem-
bers on the Oil Concessions Bill now before
the Assembly, the public might be led to
believe that many investors are still anxious
to secure areas. Actually the oil-hunt is
remarkably dull at present, and the one
thing that is worrying licensees is the pro-
blem of inducing capital to become interested
in their holdings. There is justification for
big areas; the pioneer cos. of the Nor’-West
are Frenoys and Okes-Durack, and both
having found surface indications are making
genuine efforts to follow them to their
source. If there are oil-basins they may
be 50 miles from surface indications. "Under
present conditions it seems good policy to
give big areas to those willing to do develop-
mental work, for, after all, if a payable
basin be struck, the cos. are permitted finally
to take up one area of 640 acres and two of
48 acres.
* * * *
“Nor’-West”: Captain de Hautpick’s
oil geological sketch-map of Westralia
(B. 12/10/"22) is merely a reproduc-
tion of that State’s official Geologi-
cal Map of 1920, with all areas classi-
fied as permo-carboniferous or younger indi-
cated as possibly oil-bearing, and igneous,
metamurphic and sedimentaries older than
the carboniferous as unlikely oil areas. If
the official map were strictly accurate for
every square mile in the State, then De
Hautpick’s compilation would be acceptable,
but there are vast areas in the Northern
Kimberleys requiring much more detailed sur-
veying, and which the State officials admit
will need to be re-classified. For instance,
on the Freney northern area and the O’Don-
nell block 19H, large areas classified as nul-
lagine (pre-Cambrian) contain Devonian
and possibly younger rocks quite within
the geologic range for petroleum, and a cer-
tain amount of re-classification is necessary
on the Okes-Durack property. Incidentally,
and to show how necessary it is for revi-
sionary survey work in Nor’-West Australia,
the bore-site selected by Mahoney and Kessal
on the Okes-Durack area comes well within
one of the divisions marked out by De Ilaut-
pick as an unfavorable petroliferous region.
Torquay (Vic.) “oil” found a place in
special advts. in the dailies, but it didn’t
reach Stanley Hunter’s lab. at the Mines
Department. The cold news of his analysis
was that bore samples taken by the Mines
staff were truly sand, but that they were not
of the oil-sand variety. Worst of all, Hun-
ter’s medicine was given in two doses.
First, the word went round that water tests
yielded negatives; next, that chemical tests,
while furnishing evidence of some sort of
wax, satisfied the staff that it was not oil-
wax. It was the sort of stuff that turns
up in the evaporating dish when brown coal
or such-like carbonaceous stuff has to undergo
chemical testing. Doc. Pritchard is not
satisfied by any means with Hunter’s diag-
nosis. Meantime, all the bite is out of the
market. But boring proceeds at Tor-
quay. Another jolt to the oil promoter also
comes from Mahoney, also of the Mines De-
partment, who blessed Okes-Durack (W.A.).
Secretary Stringer is out with a half-million
go for blocks round Wyndham, and others far
into the Northern Territory. In the pros-
pectus Mahoney is said to have reported
favorably on the chance of liquid oil being
discovered “in the Kimberleys,” but Mahoney
disavows this broad deduction from work
done on a single spot.

Copper Separation, Ltd., with a nominal
capital of £150,000, divided into 142.500
ordinary shares of £l, and 150,000 founders’
shares of Is., was recently floated in Perth
with the object of extracting copper, gold
and silver from ores by a method known
as the metallic contact process. Laboratory
extraction results obtained by the process
have been satisfactory, but no serious
attempt appears to have been made to de-
monstrate the success of the process on a
commercial scale. There was talk recently
of a U.S.A. group negotiating for the rights
at a high figure, and shares have been traded
in Perth at prices over £3O each.
* * * *
Recently it was claimed that the Red,
White and Blue, Norseman (W.A.), offered
5,800,000 tons ore with a gold content val-
ued at £14,500,000, out of which a profit of
£10,000,000 could be made. On the strength
of this report the leaseholders requested a
temporary advance of £30.000 from the Com-
monwealth Bank. Westralian mines-
inspector Wilson was despatched to investi-
gate, and he now throws cold water on the
scheme. Wilson discounts Milsom’s figures
considerably: ore reserves are reduced by
millions of tons, and what there is in sight
is estimated to be worth only sdwt. per ton.
“Small selected parcels of ore might be pay-
able,” is the best Wilson says about the
show.

If surface indications are any guide to
prospects at depth, Mick Williams, late of
Edna May, appears to have got on to some-
thing good at the Retaliation Reward. Ounce
values and over are obtainable at several
points, but sufficient work has not been
done to ascertain the permanency of the ore-
body exposed. Since operations commenced
a second lode has been discovered.
Grampian Hills, near Emmaville
(N.S.W.), having worked out the Chinese
block, and w r ith the debris having con-
structed embankments for two capacious
reservoirs, has decided to shift plant to the
long talus on Bailey’s section. Any little
blocks of virgin ground that were left in the
Chinese block were very rich; in the last
run a patch near a frame-post of the Halls’
puddling plant was estimated to have yielded
about a ton tin from a cubic yard of dirt.
Several slugs of tin weighing up to 21b.
were found; they had evidently been shed
from an arsenical lode which was crossed,
and this will be prospected later on. A
20-h.p. engine and a lOin. nozzle pump are
to be added to the plant; the two lOin.
pumps will be compounded on the Extended
Co.’s principle of having a separate engine
for each, so that different speeds may be
regulated as required. The co. will want
the highest nozzle pressure that it can com-
mand, as it will have some very tough
ground to deal with ; the two pumps run as
proposed may be expected to do.fairly effec-
tive work, but to the mechanical mind, which
is free from the bias of traditional local
practice, the point may suggest itself that
much higher pressures would be advan-
tageous; further than this there must be
other appliances to assist in the disintegra-
tion of the cemented wash in which the tin
is disseminated from top to bottom. Work
will be resumed at once uhder an adapta-
tion of the Roberts co-operative scheme. The
manager estimates that he has 10 years’
work in sight. The original option-holder
was assured by some local know-alls that
the show would not yield “a ton to the
mile.” Another expert ventured the opinion
that it was “waste of paper and of a 2d.
stamp to write a report on it.”

Developments at the old Ulster mine, on
the southern end of the Garden Gully reef,
Bendigo, are being followed with great in-
terest locally. The latest report states that
the stone being risen on at 1600 ft. has
increased to 7ft. in width, and is “nicely
mineralised, showing several colors of gold.”
The western portion of the reef was the most
productive in the Garden Gully group of
mines to the north. A repetition of this
in the Ulster would intensify the revival of
the old field.

Tasmania’s premier tin-sluicing show, the
Pioneer, was idle for nearly half of the
past six months, but, despite this and the
low price of tin, a net profit of £11,086 was
earned, including a working profit of £3206
from the sawmill. A div. of 6d. was paid in
January last; this was the 50th distribution,
and brought the total to £486,000 on a
capital of £161,244. The year’s return
from the electric plant on the Pioneer lead
was 236 tons tin from 372,300 cubic yards,
averaging 1.41 b. and costing 8.73 d. per yard.
The steam plant on the Argonaut lease" pro-
duced 47 tons tin from 134,000 yd., aver-
aging .7851 b. and costing 7.724 d. per yard.
Work with this plant was stopped, and a
hydraulic elevator installed has reduced
costs. The outlook is not too cheerful: “Re-
serves of bottom ground exposed are limited,
and although a considerable tonnage of tin
remains to be won, about another year’s
sluicing will bring the bottom faces in line
with the upper faces, and practically exhaukt
the payable area, outside of which none 6f
the bores, which are 150 ft. apart, have inter-
sected _ ground that is payable under present
conditions. ’ Cecil Ryan makes a suggestion
of hope in the opinion “that it is improbable
that the Pioneer lead, in which good values
had persisted over such a length of ground
would tail out so suddenly as indicated by
the bores ahead,” and he expects “to find
further payable ground ahead of the proved
area.”

Tasmania’s big State enterprise, the Great
Lake hydro-electric power scheme, is putting
up a record for Government undertakings.
It is expected that it will be completed by
the end of the year, when a supply of 63,000
£?™A p( } wer will be available. Already
54,000 horse-power is in use. Among the
large industries established in connection
with it are the zinc works and the carbide
factory. The Premier refers with pride to
the fact that to date everything has been
done without the cost of a penny to the tax-
payer- Last year a profit of £15,000 was
made. When will N. S. Wales follow suit
and utilise the Warragamba, Colo-Cordeaux
schemes, .any of which would be ample to
supply all Sydney’s electrical power and
other requirements? In no other country in
the world would such splendid resources
remain unused. Over 40 years agopnvate
money was available for this water-
power, but the fetich for State enterprise
stood in the way, and there seems little or
no hope ot its being removed or of the State
harnessing the water.
Wonbah Molybdenite, Mt. Perry district
(O.), which operated the promising quartz
P X P® th er e and went into liquidation, has
sold its crushing and concentrating plant
piecemeal and most of it has been dis-
mantled. The co. had a 10-head battery and
ne de Bava y oil-flotation plant.
\\ hen the market improved to over £2
per unit, it was thought likely that any
further improvement would have shortly
seen the mine re-open. The show had proved
itself when the slump hit it, and had jumped
into the position of premier producer of the
northern State. The Kingsgate (N.S.W.)
was better known, but this one over-
shadowed it easily, as it was nearly 50ft.
through down a couple of hundred feet
or more. It is probably one of the most
remarkable quartz pipes in the world.
John Lane, veteran prospector of Mt. Perry,
was its discoverer. It looks like a disas-
trous mistake to break up the plant just as
the market had become more promising.
The gold-production of the Rand to the
end of last year was £6fifl,ooo,ooo, or,
roughly, 1G6,500,0000z., or 4G45 long tons.
The records for Australasia would not show
much in excess of these figures, and Austra-
lian production covers a period twice that
of the Rand. While Australian production
has decreased to insignificance, that of the
Rand has advanced until now it is more than
half of the world’s record, with prospects of
further increase. The Rand position is
unique in the world’s history of gold-mining,
in that the vast production has been wholly
from low-grade mines. It is not conceiv-
able that the piles of gold, which the Solo-
mons and Croesuses used to scatter broad-
cast, were won from rock averaging less
than half-an-ounce per ton.

“The Deacon”: Michael Kelly, B.C. Arch-
bishop of Sydney and native of Waterford,
Ireland, who has been celebrating the outh
anniversary of his ordinaticm, spent many
strenuous years missionising l up and down
the distressful country, principally advocat-
ing Pussyfoot principles (though in later
years he softened considerably on these),
and then became vice-rector, of the Irish
College in Rome. Twenty yejars ago he got
the job of coadjutor to Ordinal Moran
with the right of succession. One of the
first, things he did when he took charge was
to create new and small parishes, cutting-
slices off the territory of both Regular and
Secular holders, to their infinite disgust; they
reckoned the old man’s policy was to keep
the clergv in their proper places by anchor-
ing them" as near as possible to the bread-
line. Kelly has no time for local politics,
but he has gone in bald-headed for the Irish
Free State, much to the chagrin of our
diehards, who bravely insist on the
whole hog—at a distance of 12,000 miles
from the seat of trouble. An index
to the man’s nature is supplied by the
kiddies, who haven’t any of that dread ol
him that many of their elders have, and he
seems to get his greatest happiness among
them. Seventy-twm years of age, he has
said: “God put me here to work. When
that work is done He will take me away,”
and he leaves it at that.
George Ritchie, who has thrown up the
K. Aus. Treasurership to stand for the Reps.,
is just 58. All his early years were con-
nected with the River Murray, and he is one
of the' standing authorities in Australia on
its problems Since Peake took him into a
Ministry in ’l4, he has held every possible
portfolio. Hague now becomes Treasurer,
retaining Railways and Industry also. Rit-
chie’s other job, Education, goes to Pascoe,
who moves over from Agriculture to Public
Works. G. F. Jenkins is the new member
of the team; he is a squatter, living in
Adelaide, and will take charge of Agricul-
ture, with Town-planning as a side-line.
Arthur Rickard, kingpin of Sydney Mil-
lions Club, which has done a good deal in
the eating line, will be 54 on the 17th. He
is one of a big family of boys whose father
conducted a modest business for some time
in Bathurst 1 X.S.W.L and passed out at
87 a couple of years ago in Moss Yale. One
brother of the Sydney knight is a Methodist
m mister, a 11-
other is a pub-
lic - school
teacher, and tilie
rest are in com-
mercial life.
His son, Lance,,
won an M.C.
and a majority
in the A.F.A.
during the big
war.
Barrister L.
WOOLF ,

bourne.
Adelaide’s most recent discovery in botani-
cal science, Geoffrey Samuel, is a son of J.
K. Samuel, the mining expert. A new job
has been created for him at the Varsity—a
lectureship in vegetable pathology—-where
he will assist Prof. Osborne and also act as
adviser to the Government Department of
Agriculture after he gets back from a year’s
travel designed to make him more intimate
with insect and other pests. Samuel is only
24 now, but, enlisting at 17, he was able to
get in a year in Palestine before the Armis-
tice.
Died the other day at Gladesville
(N.S.YV.) parson David Henry Dillon, “the
little man with the big voice.” Ordained in
1891 in Sydney by “Bob-cab” Smith, he was
soon making a noise as a militant Low
Churchman. He was about the last of the
better-class Anglican clergy to identify him-
self actively and aggressively with Orangeism,
and the 12th of July was the yellow-letter day
of his life. Though living ordinarily on good
terms with the lt.C. clergy and people, on
that one day he let himself go properly and
whooped for King Billy, and damned Rome,
priests, Papists, nuns and the whole box and
dice. Then he subsided to gather strength
for the next year, and took up the threads
of his frayed R.C. friendships.
Of the five surviving ex-Premiers of S.
Aus., Speaker Dick Butler (1905) is the
onlv one in active politics. Cocltburn
(1889-90) and Jenkins (1901-05) live in
England; Crawford Vaughan (1915-17) has
a good billet running the Australian cotton-
planting business, and John Verran (1910-
12), the Moonta miner, was recently elected
president of the Nationalist party—without
pay.
“D.F.”: There are Kellys in Australian
history better worth filming than Ned and
his sordid relatives. For example, James
Kelly, a native, like Hamilton Hume and
John Batman, of Parramatta. He was born
in the old town in 1791. He did a lot of
nioneering on the coasts of Tasmania and
Maoriland a century or more ago, even if
some doubt has
been raised about
his circumnaviga-
tion of the Speck
in a whaleboat in
1815-16 and his
discovery of Port
Davey and Mac-
quarie Harbor. His
memorial in old St.
David’s cemetery,
Hobart, preserves
also the memory of
his eldest son,
James, killed by a
blow from a whale
out of Hobart in
1841, and of his
third son, Thomas,
drowned in the
Derwent the follow-
ing year.
JOHN “BAWRA”
HIGGINS.
“Regent H.”: The Diggers who were re-
galed by Mrs. Rita Fiske, who got three
months the other day for using someone
else’s cheque, would have been astonished
had they known that the eyes of Scotland
Yard were on her right through her career
of sumptuous hospitality. When the war
came along, she was interested in a little
dental concern in Dalston, one of London’s
poorer suburbs. This she presently shut up
and emerged as a prodigal hostess. She gave
out that she possessed great estates in Scot-
land, and said she was sister-in-law of a dead
Melbourne General, but all the spreads she
gave were supplied by the big Australian
meat and produce importers, and she bor-
rowed the halls to give them in. John
McCall (Tas.). Newton Moore and Tom
Ryan all helped her shows along until the
huge culmination at Windsor Castle, when
she had about 10.000 Diggers along to view
King George. It was thought that she
would capture at least the same reward for
her eminent services as the one Dame Mary
Hughes landed, but the people who give
Royalty the office in the matter of handing
out these gauds seem to have shared the
detectives’ anxiety concerning her.
“Exul”: Samuel Clemes, the G.O.M. of
Tasmanian secPndary education, who died the
other day, was a Cornishman, and had .done
10 years’ missionising in Madagascar for the
Society of Friends before he came to Hobart
in 1886 as first headmaster of the Friends’
High School. In 1900 he founded his own
school, Leslie House, at Newtown, which
for the last few years has been carried on
by his son. Clemes introduced kindergarten
methods, physical culture and laboratory
instruction in scientific subjects into Tas-
manian schools, was ap active Y.M.C.A. man,
one of the founders of the Blind Society,
a member of the Royal Society, presi-
dent of the Council of Churches, and
half-a-dozen other things. His sons, W. H.
and A. W. Clemes, both distinguished them-
selves in scholarship and athletics, particu-
larly in cross-country running, and A.W. was
one of the most brilliant Rhodes Scholars the
Speck has produced.
Simpson Newland, S. Aus. retired squat-
ter, who was 87 on the 2nd, bustles into his
office in Adelaide every day with the vigor
of a man. of 50. He is author of “Paving
the Way,” an historic novel of bush life and
squatting experiences, which has run to five
editions. Newland sat for six years in the
S.A. House of Assembly for Encounter Bay,
where the opening scenes of his book were
laid, and he was Treasurer in the Downer
Ministry in 1885-86. His eldest son, H. S.
Newland, won fame during the Avar as a
wonder-worker in face-making at Sidcup.
“T.W.”: Henry Irving’s widow is among
recent recipients of £lOO Civil List pensions
to the worthy but not comfortably-placed.
Irving himself left £20,000, and when “H. 8.”
winged off a year or so ago he dropped
nearly £40,000 as unnecessary ballast. Law-
rence Irving’s total was slightly under the
thousand, but his wife, Mabel Hackney,
drowned in the same disaster, was close on
£6OOO to the good at the tragic moment.
“Rhetor” on a conflict between two loyal-
ties :
The late Father Bernard Vaughan was a frequent
visitor at the English Jesuit school where I was
educated. Though most of his life, in those days,
was spent missionising in the East End, he was par-
ticularly strong on “good form,” which he claimed
to be a species of charity, and my earliest recollec-
tions is of a stinging rebuke delivered at a lad who
had sneered at Wesleyanism. “No gentleman speaks
contemptuously of the religion of another,” he told
the sectarian in embryo. I felt disposed to argue
the point, with special reference to the Inquisition
period, but refrained —and with some ease. There
were a number of Vaughans, all priests, and all very
alike in appearance, voice and manner—tall, hand-
some, portly men, with a wonderful knack of cour-
tesy—but in particular they had one characteristic
in common: no one took liberties with them. The
World War brought out a trait in this apparently
flawless specimen of the cosmopolitan ecclesiastic
which otherwise might have remained hidden. He
proved to be an Englishman first and a priest after-
wards. Kipling himself —the most idiotically biased
Britisher on nearly all political questions in the
Empire to-day—was not more of a Jingo. Vaughan
swallowed all the yarns invented by the professional
propaganda merchants, French, British and Yankee,
to the discredit of the Huns, and helped enthusiasti-
cally to spread them. Benedict XV. was comporting
himself like a true Christian at the time. He issued
his first Encyclical Letter urging the nations to
reason with one another in November, 1914; and
from then till the fighting stopped he did not cease
preaching the Redeemer’s doctrine of brotherly love
and forgiveness. However, Christianity was hope-
lessly out of fashion, and none decried it more
vehemently, in effect, than the cultured English
aristocrat who in peace-time considered that a Catho-
lic of position degraded himself by wounding the
feelings of a Wesleyan. In 1917 the Pope’s peace
efforts were getting him disliked in England (as his
1914 and 1915 protestations had got him disliked
in Germany and Austria), and in April Father
Vaughan was inspired to write to the Times in this
strain: “As a Catholic I allow no man to stand
between me and my country. This, I take it, is the
attitude of the Stonyhurst man who is taught that
patriotism is the fair bloom whose native soil is
religion. Sir, in justice to our 70 Jesuit Fathe-s
acting as chaplains overseas, and to our 900 Stony-
hurst men serving with the colors” And so on.
No doubt he went back to Christianity after the
Armistice. He was everything that one means ny
the phrase “a good man,” a phrase which should be,
but rarely is, synonymous with the word “Christian.
It was his very kindliness and understanding toler-
ance that made the change in him the more startling
when the war found him out.
There passed out in South Africa last
month Hurtle Edwin De Mestre, son of
Etienne (Etty) De Mestre (well known in
the ’fifties and ’sixties as an owner and
trainer of racehorses) and grandson •of
Prosper De Mestre, an American naturalised
by a special Act of the N. S. Wales Coun-
cil. Prosper was a merchant and lived at
Terrara (Shoalhaven, N.S.W.), where the
son did most of his training. Etty De Mestre
won the first and second Melbourne Cups
with Archer, and the man who has just
passed out was named after the Adelaide
sportsman, Hurtle Fisher, who has been ijn-
mortalised in one of Victoria’s best-known
handicap events.
“T. 0.1.”: W. H. Paul, recently dead at 82,
was born on the ; waterside at Circular Quay,
Sydney, but in the mid-’forties his parents
went to live at Milson’s Point, and the
family has been there ever since. Old hands
will remember their picturesque Gothic cot-
tage, which stood opposite the old oak-tree,
before the rail or tram came. (The tree
was blown down on the last day of the last
century. ) An original member of the R. S. Y.
Squadron, he was in the crews of Alfred Mil-
son’s Waitanga and Era, and he sailed W.
C. Trickett’s yacht. Mabel.
Guy Fawkes’ Day is revered by Alec Pea-
cock, " Vic. Education Minister, because he
was sworn in as a Minister for the first
time, under Munro, on November 5. 1890.
He had helped to defeat the Gillies-Deakin
Coalition early on the morning of Oct. 81, five
days before. Seeing that he has to do the
talking at the unveiling of the Deakin bust*
at the State House, Peacock was rather
pleased when the ceremony was deferred from
Oct. 31 till Nov. 12. The date Deakin was
hurled from office was hardly suitable for
pedestalling a bronze likeness of him.
G. F. Dodwell, Government Astronomer of
S. Aus., while in Centralia with the eclipse-
viewers, saw at Daly Waters >a, dead tree
with a large S on it that had been carved'
by McDouall Stuart. At Mount Poole the
marked trees where Bourke died and Wills
was buried are being silted up ; floodwaters
have brought the ground level close up to
the historic marks. But the carved likeness
of Bourke by an unknown hand is well pre-
served.
“T.P.”: As Chaplain-General, Prof. Larry
Itentoul—a life-long opponent of ceremonial
churches and a permanent thorn in the side
of Archbishop Carr—spent days motoring
round northern France with Dr. Clune
(R.C.) and A. T. Holden (Methodist), in-
cidentally inspect-
ing all cathedrals
en route. Those
weren’t the days to
worry over sec-
tarian rows.
Eventually Larry
went down to ’flu
plus pleurisy, and
his mates, after
forcing him into a
hospital bed, left
to add his work to
their own. Days
after they returned
to see how the
patient was faring.
He proved to be
convalescent, but
Cl'une collapsed
with laughter,
gasping, “if Arch-
bishop Carr were
only here!” On
the identification
card at the head of
the bed some well-
meaning ass, who
didn’t know his
Melbourne, had
chanced it with
“Religion: Roman
Catholic.”
J. H. PROW HE.
M.H.R.
The fathers of Cameron, Everard and A.
A. Billson, M’s.L.A., were all in the Vic.
Assembly before them, and the sires of the
two Clarkes (Russell and Frank) and Davis,
M’s.L.A., and Wettenhall, M.L.A., were in
the Plush Chamber, where also sat J. H.
Abbott, the stepfather of R.H.S., who
adopted his surname.
“Azrim”: As someone recently wrote of
family occupations, let me turn on the red
lamps of the medical Sleeman family, whose
brass plates hang out in various parts of
Vic. Five have graduated M.B. et B.S.
(Melb.), and there are two medical students
in the last years of their courses. Inciden-
tally, they have collected over £l4OO in
scholarships and exhibitions, and a couple of
the older members are noted T.B. experts.
Warren Kerr, who succeeds Bell Jackson
as a Vic. State Savings Bank Commissioner,
acted for a couple of years as deputy when
that man of many jobs, McCay, was away at
the war. He has been president of the
Chamber of Commerce, has served on State
and inter-State boards, and is one of the
most vigorous minds in Vic. Congregational-
ism. Had McPherson gone into Federal
politics, Kerr, who lives at Kew, would pro-
bably have captured the Hawthorn Assem-
bly seat.
T. G. Ellery, Town Clerk of Melbourne,
got a raking from some of the councillors,
the other day, and Gaud Mayor Swanson
found it necessary to spill some ink in his
defence. Ellery hasn’t the Fitzgibbon per-
sonality to sustain him in any autocratic
effort. ' Because of his guardianship of the
parks and his genuine love of the city, the
public of 30 years ago (ere he went to the
Board of Shirks as chairman) would stand
anything from Fitzgibbon as Town Clerk —
but they won’t have another uncrowned king
these days.
“Old Mate”: I can’t understand why the
labor unions should show such violent anti-
pathy towards Jack Quick, one of the
recently-appointed Federal Arbitration
Judges. Originally a mine-worker, it was
only dogged perseverance that gained him the
LL.D. degree. He hadn’t the slightest
adventitious assistance, and his ’Varsity
work had to be done simultaneously with
the hard graft of a newspaper reporter. All
his life has been spent in the Bendigo dis-
trict, and above all other lawyers, he ought
to have a thorough insight into industrial
matters. His natural sympathies are dis-
t;nctly with the class from which he sprang.
He belongs to the ultra-methodical dry-as-
dust school of lawyer and politician, and it
cannot be said that he has been a brilliant
success at either. With a dash of the vola-
tile romanticism, artistry and _ quaintness
usually associated with the Cous’n Jack, he
might have achieved greater popularity.
LONELINESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The dusky night, the cool, star-powdered sky,
Enwrap me with a subtle sympathy;
And all the quiet trees, as 1 go by,
Murmur their leaves, and whisper words to me.
The weary road winds slowly to the sea,
Past wayside cottages with gleaming eye.
But merry lights will taunt me from afar:
I wish they wouldn’t leave their blinds ajar!
The pictures on the wall, the cheerful glow,
The childish faces, wistful, grave and gay;
The mother's tender smile- thesje haunt me so
And add a shadow to the dy&ng day
Long after I have turned my steps away.
Oh, poignant memories of long ago!
Oh, things that might have been, and things that
are!
I wish they wouldn’t leave their blinds ajar!
VICTORIA.

CITROEN
THE WORLD’S ECONOMY CAR,
Breaks the
WORLD’S RECORD
Made by Citroen at lie Mans, 1921, when Stock Model Tourer
weighing 23cwt. averaged 73 Vz m.p.g. With the New Model
Citroen, at Le Mans, 1922, it established a new World’s Record for
Petrol Consumption, obtaining
80.96
MILES PER GALLON
With a 4-Passenger Car, Averaging Over 25 Miles per Hour.
CITROEN Holds World’s Record for 1920-21-22.
The New 1922 Models, specially built for Australia, with 4ft. 3in.
track, embody many additional outstanding features —larger engine,
bigger wheels, higher and larger radiator.
CITROEN,
The consistency and ease with which the Citroen
adds record to record demonstrates the superiority
of its unique design, of which the famous double
helical Citroen gears are but one feature. They
practically eliminate vibration, shocks and wear;
are extremely silent in operation and yield 98.7%
efficiency (Hopkinson’s Test).

An Adelaide policeman has been grappling
with the legal mysteries of Supply and De-
livery. He happened to be just outside a
hotel fence during prohibited hours, when a
voice from within demanded “Are you
there?” and “Is it all right?” He said
“Yes” to both, and was handed a bottle of
whisky over the fence; on which he laid a
charge of “unlawfully supplying liquor.”
The Police Court, however, held that the
amber joy had been merely delivered, not
supplied. “The liquor handed over the
fence wss not intended for the sergeant.
Supply means delivery plus something. It
was not unlawful supply unless the liquor
handed over went to the person for whom it
was intended.”
LENDING ENCHANTMENT.
“The main charm in this sketch is its dis-
tance.”
“Yes. The. farther you get away from it
the better.”
“Blackfriars”: Except when the two Cups
are imminent, busy Melbourne people have
invariably to ask at post offices for money-
order forms when they want them; but dur-
ing the last three or four weeks Form
M.O. 116 has been left about in hundreds
on the counters and telegraph desks for the
convenience of those consumed by a sudden
solicitude to pay five hnd ninepence to some-
one in Tasmania. In one suburban office I
watched 12 people in 10 minutes despatch-
ing five and ninepences to addresses in
Hobart, and the sight of Form M.O. 116 was
so tempting that I fell also. There is
nothing hypocritical about Boynton’s Post
Office —oh, dear no !
“Gnarek” on a heartless deception:—
One of the many frauds perpetrated on unsophis-
ticated Diggers in Blighty was engineered by the
hereditary blacksmith
of a village near Dur-
ington, on Salisbury
Plain. His forge was
over-shadowed by a
luxuriant horse-chest-
nut tree, whilst close
handy were the village
church and school-
room. In fact, every-
thing seemed to «ug-
g e s t Longfellow’B
poem. Consequently
few were surprised
when one morning a
sign appeared, “The
original smithy of
‘The Village Black-
smith.’ ” The place
immediately became a
sort of shrine. Crowds
of Diggers, whom no-
body had previously
suspected of sentiment,
purchased (at sixpence
each) chestnuts sup-
posedly plucked from
the fabled tree; and
the crush became so
great eventually that
a special M.P. picket
had to be posted to
prevent serious damage
being done by souvenir
hunters. The ulti-
mate exposure of the
blacksmith was accom-
plished by a sceptical
padre, who, poking
around among the de-
ceiver’s family tomb-
stones in the church-
yard, found no in-
stance where the wife
had predeceased the
husband —an item care-
fully mentioned by
the poet. This was
generally held to be
fatal to the Wiltshireman’s story. Still, for all
that, the last time I saw him he was seated in
his own Ford. (Query: Isn’t the real scene of “The
V. B.” laid in America?)

“0.K.”: Does a young man with curly
hair and a melodramatic mode of address ever
have much sense of humor A prepossess-
ing bigamist, answering to the foregoing de-
scription, protested to a Melbourne Judge
last week: “I am willing to work hard, and
since I have been in gaol I have been keep-
ing straight and working hard.” A prisoner
who seriously tells you he has kept straight
in quod will never die of suppressed merri-
ment. You couldn’t tickle him to death.
“T.R.H.”: “D.” (B. 26/10/’22) seeks an
explanation for the Federal Government
permitting “the indiscriminate use of the
Yankee quack asthma
remedy which is
fairly bristling with
cocaine.” Possibly he
may find it in the
duty-stamp. On week-
days the State Gov-
ernments permit the
sales of deadly “pinky”
because, presumably,
they contribute to the
exchequer. For the
same reason a drunk
can buy at a chem-
ist’s on Sunday- a
wretched “tonic-wine,”
made of “pinky,”
quinine and beef-
extract. The “pinky”
in this instance, goes
under the alias of
“fine old port.” The park and Domain
drunkard who cannot afford “tonic” wine”
on Sunday can buy—rLo at any chemist’s
—a big bottle of methylated spirits for nine-
pence.

“C.M.G.”: Simpkins, after a convivial
evening at the club, a troubled night and
a farcical breakfast, made a break for his
usual tram. He had cut it a bit fine, and
the conductor considerately delayed giving
the signal to start until his passenger had
got breathlessly aboard. Simpkins expressed
his appreciation of the courtesy, and the
conductor reciprocated by voicing the hope
that Simpkins had reached home safely the
previous night. “You didn’t seem to be too
sure of yourself,” he added. “I wasn’t,”
admitted the other uneasily. “I had a night
off the chain, and perhaps a few too many. I
hope I d’dn’t make myself objectionable on
the tram?” “Not a bit,” grinned the other
reassuringly. “You were most polite and
considerate, like you always are. Even got
up and offered your seat to a young lady.”
“No out-of-the-way politeness about that,
surely,” said Simpkins a.rily. “Well, there
was in this case. You see, she and you
were the only passengers aboard.”

“Eli Wombat”: Sergeant Buttplate,
marooned on Salisbury Plain, badly wanted
to renew his acquaintance with Piccadilly
before going overseas again, so he fired in
an application for leave, ending with the
following: “My reason for requesting this
leave will be found in Musketry Regulations,
para. 319, page 126.” C<<--siderably puzzled,
the C.O. turned up the section referred to
and read: “Officers and non-commissioned
officers should be given occasional opportuni-
ties of reviving their impressions of the
human figure at various known distances.”
The adjutant agreed with the C.O. that if
was worth 48 hours.
“Maske”: It is part of. the duty of
the District Officer in New Guinea
to accompany all Expropriation Board
officers when paying off indentured natives
employed on the islands. Last month
the Board Officer was “paying off”
time-finished boys on one of the islands
when his cash gave out. A hasty calculation
elicited the fact that at least £lOO more
was needed. The, officer consequently dis-
missed the pay parade, telling the boys to come
back m two hours’ time, and followed them
off the scene, while the D.O. went on with*
some other official duties. Two hours elapsed
and the Board Officer (a dinkum Digger) re-
turned with a well-filled bag and completed
his disbursements. The District Officer,
knowing there was no bank on the island,
asked who had come to his rescue, and
the ex-D‘gger explained his modus
opcrandi : “You see, I brought up with me
quite a lot of new goods for the store the
Board runs, and it was a perfectly safe
assumption that the boys, as fast as thev
were paid, would spend their monev with
us. It you only knock off for an interval
when you’re half-way through, vou soon find
that you can manage with half the monev
Savvy ?
“Maske”: A member of an engineering
firm sailed, not long since, from Rabaul to
Ivaowoing (N.G.) without obtaining a per-
mit for his 10-ton schooner from the
Harbor Master’s Department. On his re-
turn he was charged with neglect to observe
the regulations, and his license as captain
was suspended for two months. Being
anxious to sail again in two days’ time on
a salvaging job he applied for a captain’s
license and permit to sail for his cookboy
This was granted, and the real skipper sailed
on his ship as a passenger, the cookboy
being rated as captain. Thus the local Navi-
gation Regulations were strictly adhered to
and the necessary respect paid to exalted
officialdom.

“Billy Wheeler”: When Darwin wrote his
‘ Origin of Species” he never contem-
plated the mixture of species that would
some day be found at the capital of the N.T.
which bears his name. Chows, Japs, Malt-
ese, abos., Polynesians, Greeks, Swedes and
unidentifiable half-castes predominate. Union-
ism is just as mixed. Included in the mem-
bership of the Secesh Union, which came
into being because one O’Dell, a returned
soldier, refused to complete his levy in
support of the local Labor paper, were the
president and secretary of the A.S.E., the
secretary of the Amalgamated Carpenters
and the local undertaker. Meanwhile Harold
Nelson is down south trying to out-register
the Secesh Union.

“J.W.R.” recalls an episode of the good
old days:—
Our Chinese brethren had a bad time of it at the
hands of the Cousin Jacks in the early diggings days.
Three things Ah Fat couldn’t resist —fowl-roost, kid-
pen and sluice-box—and I shall never forget the
occasion on which one Celestial was caught red-
handed in a hennery by its owner. He was bound
in stout rope from head to feet; then when a single
block had been fastened to a pole projecting over the
mouth of a tunnel, a rough “bosun” was rigged, and
the Chow soon found himself dangling in mid-air with-
out any chance to escape. The first intention was to
limit the punishment to keeping him suspended
there all night; but, severe as that would have been
—it was a bitterly cold night—it did not satisfy
the infuriated owner of the fowls. One of the birds
found in Ah Fat’s bag was decapitated and the flut-
tering carcase was suspended about two feet over
the Chow’s head so that the blood trickled over him.
At daylight, covered with coagulated blood, he pre-
sented a gruesome spectacle. He was then taken
down and tarred and feathered and his pigtail was
cut off, soaked in tar and tied around his neck.
His bonds having been untied an energetic impulse
CROSS PURPOSES.
“I’ve joined the Housewives' Association.”
“Gripes, aren't wimmen the limit! Here's

gang whose avowed intention is to bring
prices down.”
from a No. 13 boot gave him a start of at least
10 feet on his home journey. The loss of his pig-
tail brought the ban of ostracism on him, and be
quitted the camp that afternoon amidst a fusillade
of fireworks, not as a sympathetic parting but as an
exorcism of the devils associated with him. The
same night the Cousins in “revival” meeting offered
thanks to their all-beneficent God for His “manifold
mercies.”

THE REBELS WARNING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Irish rebels threaten with reprisals the news-
papers which persist in calling them ‘Irregulars’
and printing the rank of officers in inverted commas.”
— Cable-
We’ve lots of stomach left us for the fight,
And blood in scrap and skirmish to be spilled.
We don’t complain at being put to flight,
We make no special song if we are killed.
But when it comes to an unworthy slight
Our hearts with wrath and bitterness are tilled.
Be warned and cut it out, or soon you’ll learn
How trodden worms can turn.
We do not cavil at corporeal hurt,
To being cut to pieces we’re inured.
But we unhesitatingly assert,
And you are solemnly herewith assured
That calling Us Irregulars is dirt,
An innuendo not to be endured.
A workman dubbed a “blackleg” or a “scab”
Endures no fowler stab.
To keep us on the run is in the game,
Whether it’s done with bullets or with bombs ;
But when you see the rank before your name
Figure in type between “inverted corns”—
As if you were a “captain” of the same
Variety as Salvo Dicks and Toms —
The kindliest revolution’ry, begad!
Sees red—goes fighting mad.
We’re here to be assailed with shot and shell,
But not with editorial jeer and gibe.
If you should force us to reprisals fell
On your persistently maligning tribe
We’ll take a vengeance black and terrible
By (Heaven help you!) ceasing to subscribe,
And ads about promotions in our “corps”
Shall reach your rags no more.

In gladness we proclaim: “The winter’s fled I

“Faceplate”: While looking for a job the
other day I struck a South Melbourne con-
cern, the chief engineer of which took par-
ticulars as to my previous employers, length
of service with each, references and other
useful data. I thought myself as good as
punching the clock, when lie finalised witli
“And, now, what religion do you profess?”
I told him, and was forthwith ushered outside,
having made a wrong guess. And yet one
wouldn’t want to cut gears to “The Battle
of the Boyne” or “The Wearing of the
.Green.” Personally I don’t care a curse
for either, and if I had any musical prefer-,
once it would be for “Now the Day Is Over.”
Anyhow, the next prospective boss who in-
quires about my creed will strike, according
to the shape of his nose, either a Seventh
Day Adventist or a Jew.

“Lip” describes a good old English game:
I was on a Sydney beach a few Sundays ago when
a bather came limping from the water, and in
response to my casual inquiry as to what he had
trodden on, produced a lady’s ring. It was an expen-

“Yes. When I was a child I used to think it would he wonderful

“And I suppose you still think so?”
sive looking gewgaw, and, ''surveying the sparkling
gems, I agreed that it was probably worth a few
pounds. He asked whether I would care to buy it.
1 didn't care, and he proceeded to try a couple
sitting just behind us, who had been interested spec-
tators of the proceedings. Edwin took the find,
examined it critically, and offered a quid. Bui the
bather wouldn’t listen to that. Then Angelina,
having found that the ring fitted her, whispered
something to the swain and a bargain was struck at
£2. Last Sunday, on another beach, I joined a little
knot of people and found the object of their atten-
tion to bo a lucky chap who had just found a ring
in the sand. It goes without saying that he was my
previous acquaintance. Also, he was a “choom,” and
the ring, which had fetched £3 this time, was a
full brother to the other one. At the risk of

being charged as an accessory before (or after) the
fact. I put his pot on. Why? Because I believe
him to be a relation to the man who, on Bourne-
mouth beach, in England, during the war, sold me
a gold chain he had picked up at the moment I came
along. A policeman told me, a few minutes later,
that I could have got 11 others like it if 1 had paid
my pound to a shop. It took just three days for
the “gold” to rub off that chain; but six years
haven’t rubbed out the memory of the policeman’s
airy remark that such valuables were found every day
on every beach in England, and would continue to
be, so long as such as l were at large.

“T. 8.”: With regard to Spahlinger’s
alleged cure for tuberculosis, Massy Greene
stated, the other day,
that the Federal Gov-
ernment are still in
treaty with the dis-
coverer, but are dis-
inclined _ to pay the
high price demanded
for exclusive Austra-
lian rights to the
remedy, ffhoeve r
heard of anyone hav-
ing to pay vile dross
for a real discovery
in medicine? It is
always freely given
away, no matter what
potential money value
it may have. Lister
did not ask for pay-
ment for introducing
his antiseptic method,
nor did he keep it a
secret. Pasteur never
withheld any discov-
ery for a moment. The
discoverer of the anti-
toxin of diphtheria, a
member of the Pas-
teur Institute, made
nothing out of his
serum; and the cele-
brated Metchnikoff,
when he got mixed up
with a company who
exploited his name for
the preparation of the
equivalent of the pre-
sent “Russian cul-
ture,” never heard the
end of it from his
scientific ' confreres.
The more unreliable
and rotten an alleged
cure is, the more a
pseudo-scientist will
ask for it. The pro-
fession of medicine
would not offer a
farthing for a 1000-
gallon tank full of Spahlinger’s serum. Why,
then, should legislators be so anxious to get
hold of it?

“M.D.” on the dangers of the tin as a
food-container:—
At Loch Maree, in Scotland, recently, every par-
taker of some sandwiches made of potted wild duck
(eight in all) died a horrible death. The' same
thing may occur anywhere where tinned or potted
foodstuffs are eaten.. In this case nothing was elicited
at the inquiry condemnatory of the reputable London
firm which had supplied the food, and the outbreak,
which w T as admitted by the Scottish Board of Health
to be botulism, represented the first appearance of
that dread disease in the U.K. In America it is
fairly frequent. The only profitable outcome of the
inquiry was the resolution to have supplies of the
specific antitoxin available at all prominent tourist
resorts. But nothing has been proved as to its
efficacy in man, though it is said to be useful in
animals. Such a tragedy, of course, means careless-
ness somewhere. The bacillus botulinus is killed at
comparatively low temperatures, and the more resist-
ant spores, which require a heat considerably above
212 F., are destroyed when the paste is sterilised
before being put in jars. If the bacillus is present,
being anaerobic, it grows luxuriantly in a sealed
tin or jar, and the death-dealing toxins generated
would not be revealed when the food was smelt or
tasted. The extraordinary thing at Loch Maree was
the length of time that elapsed before the victims
noticed that anything was wrong with them. The
shortest time to bring ■ the first symptom, double
vision (one of the sufferers saw his friend smoking
two pipes several hours before he felt sick), was IS
hours, and the longest 40 hours, after eating the
sandwiches. The poison always picks out the cranial
nerves first; presently the lips, tongue, deglutition
and speech are paralysed, death ensuing from para-
lysis of respiration and the heart. Botulism, by the
way, has been caused by canned vegetables and
fruits as well as meats.

“Harold Hardupp’s” tragedy of mean
streets: —-
“Olive Jones, 26 (the surname is not
the right one), was a name that leapt
into my memory when I read of a
wofnan who, picked up unconscious in
the street, died in hospital. I met Olive
five years ago, in the course of an unoffi-
cial investigation of the warren about
East, Upton and Campbell streets, Surry
Hills. She was then only 21, though
she looked far more. An old knife-
wound in her cheek seemed to glow (the
blood around the bluish sear caused
that effect) as, sullenly and resentfully,
she told her life history. Her mother
had “taken up with’’ a Chinaman when
she was 13; arid as her father had sig.
nalised the event by kicking the daughter
out of what home she knew, she went to
live with the mixed pair. The mother
sold her to another 1 . Chinaman when she
was 14.- She bolted from him to a
Greek, but got the knife-wound because
that high-spirited immigrant expected
her. to keep him in the old way, and
she. raised objections, So she went back
-—to another Chinaman; Bv the time
she was 21 she had gone well to the
pack, and was far on her way to perdi-
tion ; but she was also nursing a bed-
ridden old woman living in a room in
that squalid neighborhood, who called her
“dear Oily.’’ If one of her cheap lovers
happened to have flowers in his posses-
sion she didn’t forget to ask for them
and take them to the sickroom; and
when a drunk was shouting she always
asked him to “leave a gin for old
Betsy”—and she would take good care
that Betsy got it, too. “Olive Jones,
26” —and a supplementary item that she
died of alcoholic poisoning and neglect.
Not a lovely picture in a “civilised”
city; but in her own bitter words of
five years back: What chance had she ?
“Azrim”: She blew into a Collins-street
consulting-room and inquired whether, in
view of an approaching trip to the islands,
she hadn t better be vaccinated. The phy-
sician thought she had. Could she be done
at once? Certainly. At this point she be-
came explanatory. The arm? No. She
went in extensively for jazz and theatre-
parties. The leg? Well, ye-es, p’r’aps • but
skirts are so short. xV little above the ’knee
would be right. There? Oh, but mightn’t
the stocking-dye be harmful?.... A little
higher, don t you think? Yes as long as
the suspender doesn’t chafe. Oh, yes ; there '
That would do admirably. The doctor pre-
pared the selected spot, and was just about
to begin when a voice broke in with a touch
of apprehension: “It would be dreadful if
skirts are worn even shorter next year!”
* * * *
“Uramao”: Dunedin has been tailin’ a
thocht o’ its soul. Ever since the first Presby-
terians set out fra’ the Land o’ Cakes an’
Parritch tor Heaven, as Mark Twain once
said when visiting the city, and mistakenly
got off the ship there, thinking they had
reached their destination, it has been a
stronghold of Seotchbyterianism. But a
statement made at the Church Assembly,
held last month, is causing many to suspect
that Auld Reekie himself has got a footing
in the place. There have been decreases
in church membership, decreases in baptisms,
decreases in admissions; in fact, decreases all
round, with one exception—there has been
no decrease in church indebtedness. A de-
spondent meenister, by the name of Evans,
said he had come to the conclusion that “the
church in M.L. was no longer a going con-
cern.”
“Coot”: Re the Nelson descendants who
are still pensioners upon the British tax-
payers (B. 21/9/’22). The stock of Well-
ington did even better. After “Boney” had
been finally disposed of, the King of the
Netherlands (of which Belgium was then
a part) not only created Wellington “Prince
of Waterloo.” but destowed upon him an
estate valued at about £50,000, and suffi-
ciently extensive to constitute him one
of the largest landowners in the little
kingdom. According to Stanhope, the value
of this realty had increased threefold in 1845,
and to-day the Wellington’ family must be
drawing an immense income from a gift
expressly declared to be inalienable. At
about the same time the Bourbon King ot
France bestowed some £40,000 worth of
jewels upon the Iron Duke. And from his
own grateful country the victor of Waterloo
got a £60,000 “war gratuity,” in addition to
certain lands and a string of titles of great
marriageable- value.

“Howitzer,” more in sorrow than in anger:
Claude, of the nth Batt., #as much in demand
at the impromptu concerts on hoard our trans-
port, he being an amateur ventriloquist. After
a few nights in the line at Fleurbaix (a very
quiet sector at the time) we missed our platoon
officer, and it was the erstwhile drawing-room
entertainer who volunteered to find him. About a
dozen of us clustered round Claude at the parapet
as he stared out intently into No Man’s Land. Sud-
denly an eerie voice called from an adjacent shell-
hole: “Here, quickly, boys; I’m done for!” There
was no waiting. The mob went as one man, and a
wakeful Hun machine-gunner seized his opportunity,
too, with disastrous results to five of us. Still, we
NOT A LAP DASH .
“And is he courting you?"
“Not exactly — yet. But lie's approaching the point
step by step. When he first- called lie sat all
the evening with the album in his-lap. Next
time he sat with my poodle in his lap. Next
night he took my little brother in his lap. So
you see, I hope it will soon be my turn,"
were all retrieved eventually, the only corpse
being that of our missing second loot. The amazing
part of the story is that Claude was only stunting,
and did not dream that the shell-hole into which he
had projected his voice held the dead body of the
officer who was being sought. Nobody thanked
Claude, but I suppose I am indirectly indebted to
him for the pension I now draw for having stopped
one in the left lung.

“Dingbat”: A pair of magpies have built
their nursery in the gear-box of a mower on my
place. All the work of the farm goes on within a
few' yards of them, as the mower stands by the cow-
shed, which is doing full time. A team of horses
has been working right by the nest for days; but
Mrs. Maggie takes no notice and is still busy hatching
her brood. The birds are not pets, and there’s whips
CAUGHT.
Did Binns go after you token you eloped with his
daughter?”
"Yes, and he’s keen with me ever since.”
of timber close handy. We are going to let the
old lady rear her family, and dispose of them as she
p eases, but they stand a good chance of learning the
Australian lingo very young, as half a chain from
the nest there’s a set of harvesting implements to
*- )e tinkered, up in a day or two.
Mrs. Lance Rawson: Re “Ross’s”
drama of Outback (B. 12/10/’22). In the days when
there were shepherds and ration-carriers on the Bur-
net (Q.) an English youth of 17 reached a Chinese
shepherd s hut one day to find the wife, a young girl,
about to become a mother. “You’ve got to stay
with me till it’s over,’’ she told him ; and he stayed.
Moreover, with the aid of a book called “Bull’s
Hints to Mothers” he succeeded in bringing a young
Australian into the world. On another occasion in
the Maekay district a little German woman alone
in the bush, except for her two small children—the
husband being away with cattle —delivered herself
of twins, washed and dressed both, and two days
later, when a traveller called, she Was sitting up on
her bed brushing her little girl’s hair. But liow
many' of us in the old days ever had or wanted a
doctor’s aid at such times? Whole families were
born under wool-waggons and in tents pitched on
the roadside, while travelling! to and from the sta-
tions. And were we any the worse for it? Also, I
doubt whether the wives and mothers of those days
were really any stronger than those of to-day.
“Ivey-string”: The farmer who told
“Gippo” (B. 19/10/’22) that his horse had pulled
itself blind was not necessarily romancing. I once
hitched a great puller—he’d been a champion leader
in the boom days of carrying between Grafton and
Glen Innes (N.S.W.) —on to a very big mare that had
slipped into a boggy gully. After two unsuccessful
attempts, old Tom seemed to realise what was
wanted, and putting out apparently his last ounce of
strength pulled the mare right up the steep bank
and on to level ground. Ten days later he was stone-
blind, and never regained his sight.

“Pee Gee”: “S.J.H.’s” townie who found
“a bullock bogged up to the udder in Pine Swamp”
(B. 19/10/’22) reminds me of one we’ve got here.
The other day lie rushed up to the boss and gasped,
“A cow’s just jumped through the fence.” ‘-‘Which
cow, Bill?” asked the boss. “The one with the big
breasts,” explained William.
... * * * *
‘feenex” : There have been some question-
able rabbo-watto crosses on the Abo. page, but
here’s a dinkum one. A few years ago a rosella and
a crimson parrot, or lory, were found to be running
a nursery in a hollow tree, and the offspring of
the mixed love affair are to be seen any day either
at Armidale (N.S.W.) or on a station near Bun-
darra. The birds have distinct markings of both
rosella and lory.
* * * *
“Giiigai”: “Magela Bada’s” par. about the
New Guinea nigger using a non-poisonous snake as
a love-charm (B. 19/10/’22) reads funnily. The sight
of any snake, whether 6in. or 6ft. long, will send
any native from around Port Moresby flying for his
life, and this irrespective of whether it is venomous
01 not. Work is often delayed while you collect
s'our boys ’ from anywhere up to a mile away, after
a snake has been brought to light. One year Christ-
mas dinner at the hotel was served at 3 p.m., through
one of the local wags lassoing a native waiter with
a dead carpet-snake. It took from 1 till 3 o’clock
to entice the waiters and cooks back to the pub.
Some islanders, however, notably the Goariberis, run
to instead of from a snake; but the only part of
their bodies they rub with it is the inside
* * •» *
“W. G. Bee”; A while back I got an old-
man dingo in a trap near Scadden (W.A.), and set
about finishing him with the strongest sticks avail-
able. Every whack broke a waddy, but he was
eventually put out. I made sure
two or three times over. Then
producing a knife—or, truth-
fully, an implement that served
as cold-chisel, twine-knife, wire-
cutter and such-like—l com-
menced to earn the dollar attached
to the scalp. I sawed and sawed,
and eventually broke through his
tough hide, and lifted a strip
over the ears and nearly to tail.
1 had just told my boy to put his
foot on the dog’s head while I
completed the job when the dingo
shot from under him and
streaked out for the horizon with
the scalp dangling behind him.
I followed, but he tricked me,
and the last I saw of him was
going- over a dry salt lake and
jumping high in the air, the salt
evidently tickling up his bare
flesh. I don’t know what hap-
pened to him in the long run,
but I guess he won’t kill any
more of my pigs. Still, can any
Abo. tell me when a dingo is
dead ?
* * *
“Pick”: Coincidence or
what ? On a bluff overlooking
the northern shore of Wallaga
Inlet (N.S.W.) stood a solitary
old ribbon-gum whose gnarled
trunk, at one of its bends, was
humped into a striking resem-
blance of a black gin gazing out
over the waters. The Wallaga
tribe always believed that when
the tree fell someone would
drown in the lake, and the full-
bloods of the mission station
there, in reverence of the tradition, let the old gum
stand when they cleared the point. A little while
back a wood-carter felled the tree for firewood, and
that afternoon not one of the abo. camp would
approach the water. They resumed their boating and
fishing the next morning, however. Spouneer, the only
white fisherman on the lake, had been entangled in
his nets and drowned during the night.
“Equinine”: “Borum” (B. 19/10/’22) is
near the mark when he says the fresh-water leech
is responsible for swamp cancer in horses. I have
seen these growths the size of a man’s head and
weighing over 51b. The rapidity of growth (when
they are situated in the fetlocks) is accelerated bv
the brushing of the other foot and flies. Dissec-
tion of the larger size fungus shows it to be sup-
ported by layers of a tendonous substance (forming
a neck, which can be felt with the fingers under the
mushroom-shaped top. A guaranteed cure is: Cut the
growth off with a very sharp knife as close to the
skin as possible (a painless operation), and paint
the raw surface with undiluted nitric acid, taking
caie not to let the acid touch the skin; cover with

cotton-wool and bandage fairly tightly; leave on for
a week, and repeat each week until a thick scab
forms. As any irritation, such as dies or the horse
biting, starts the growth afresh, it is advisable to
keep the wool and bandages going till the part is
quite healed.

I>ung : Their mutual recriminations
concerned the perfidy of each other in a recent horse
swap. ‘Yer needn’t skite that yer bested me any-
way,” snarled Bollard. “That ole crock I deal’ed yer
tails jist as_ heavy an’ as reg’lar as this flamin’
crock yer give me.” “Of course he does,” said
Gilligan, “but you’ll admit he has a better blanky
way of getting up again, won’t you ?”
(B* : I<N H d Kelly ’ s ” Chow swaggie
• 28 /, 9 / 22) reminds me of one 1 struck on the
Dubbo-Gilgandra-road in ’O3. This Ah Mug was
carrying a young sapling across his shoulders, with
his swag swung on one end, and his billycan and a
lair-sized stump on the other to balance it. It
was water-bag weather at the time, and I was dam’
pleased I hadn’t learned the Chinese way of carrying
a swag. &
Barcoo ; If the lid hasn’t been put on
the mutton-bird argument (B. 28/9/’22) let me re-
mark that the idea that the bird migrates to parts
unknown is a fallacy. All it does is to make away
fiom its haunts round Bass Straits in the south to
the more salubrious climate and cushy nesting grounds
ot the tens of thousands of small sand-covered
islands that dot the northern sea within the Great
Barrier Reef and Torres Strait. Here the parent
birds scoop their nests in the yielding sand, and
hatch their young. They seem to have no fear ol
man, as camping excursionists sleeping on the
beaches are crawled over by the trustful birds the
whole night long. The breeding season begins with
the whole gang simultaneously and ceases with the
same exactitude. They appear in one night as if by
magic, and when the parents have reared the family
up to the flying stage and the time for migration to
the south arrives, in some mysterious way the signal
is given, and on the instant the lot are in the air
winging to the south. It is a sight worth viewing—
as far as you can see in any direction is just one
huge mass of birds flying in the one direction. Theiv
keep out to sea—which accounts for these flights
being so rarely remarked upon. The south is the
Band of Promise of the mutton-bird, because when
it flies from its northern haunts it is as poor as
Binghi’s mongrel dog.

“<r.”: Humans haven’t a monopoly of
Pluck. A crow used to visit our woodheap and
commandeer the eggs, and one morning the missus
fired a shot at him and broke one of his legs He
was back again next day at the same address. This
tune a shot loosened a few feathers. The follow-
ing morning he came along with a few cobbers—and
the missus swears they were busy digging a trench
when she brought her blunderbuss to bear on ’em.
“Lenah”: “Jim Carew’s” blue-tinted
honey (B. 7/9/’22) was probably gathered by the
bees from one of the many varieties of gum-trees—
most likely the peppermint gum, which is a very
irregular bloomer. When the peppermint blooms in
the autumn its honey is very dark, but in the
spring it is lighter and of a bluish tint. Honey
from clover, apple-blossom and raspberry is very
light in color, while that from ti-tree is very
dark. Again, that from blackberry, clematis or
horehound is of a greenish tint. Our spring crop of
honey here (Tas.) is very light in color, being
gathered from the apple-blossoms in the district. In
the autumn it is very much darker. Some grades
when in bulk often show a bluish tinge. It is no
less inferior, although some people prefer the light
NO RISK INVOLVED.
“I saved three fellows’ lives this morning.”
"At which bar?”
amber-colored honey. If any noxious property
happens to be gathered by the bees from flowers and
stored in the cells, it is usually evaporated before
the cell 1 is sealed up. “Jim Carew’s” honey, 1
should say, is quite wholesome.
“Ding Bhat”: “Murranji’s” scorn of the
Pitt-street stockmen (B. 19/10/’22) is rate paro-
elll'y Lawson and other high-priests of
the bushland dwelt much among the “faces in the
street ; and, as for horsemanship. I know a metro-
politan editor who spends his week-ends down Wagga
(N.S.W.) way breaking in young outlaws, and—here’s
the rub—getting well paid for it, too!

TO ROVING GO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Campers and rovers, one and all,
Green hills beckon, and warm winds blow,
Thrushes warble and waters call —
For this is the season to roving go.
Who’s for the gullies, and who’s for the heights,
Who’s for boating on blue lagoons ?
Bright stars sprinkle the dewy nights,
And bright are the lights of golden noons.
Trees are tossing their glossy heads,
Ripples race on the azure bays;
Peaks and purples, and greys and reds,
Are tinting the leaves in the leafy ways.
South comes Summer, to paint for men
Glowing pictures by night and day—
Old men, be ye as boys again,
And boys, be ye—as the birds are—gay.
Pluck the fruit while yet there is time.
Age grows listless and seasons change:
t T p, high up, on the ranges climb,
Down in the deep, deep gullies range.
Summer, Summer will have its day,
Whether our worries will let it or no;
Over and over it seems to say-
“Oh, this is the season to roving go!”

■‘Macte”: Tommy, the youngest blaekboy
on the station, liad never seen a township or a train
until a few days ago, when I took him into hong-
reach (Q.). At the railway station his eyes
bulged as the train approached, and he instinctively
drew closer to me; but when it stopped, he ran for
the lick of his life —no, not for the scrub, but
straight to the engine-driver, to whom he yelled at
the top of his voice: “How you hobble dat feller?
How you hobble dat feller?”

“W.S.W-” adjusts some tragic facts: —
“The Overlander’s” (13. 28/9/’22) par re the fatal
bush fare on Warenda station, in this district
(Boulia, W.Q.) in 1917, while correct in the general
description is a bit astray on one or two points. A
man named Roberts was driving the waggonette in
the morning and a young chap named Roy Dixon
came along on horseback and offered to change
places—a change which cost Dixon his life. Roberts
took Dixon’s horse and cantered ahead. Suddenly
the lightning lit flies on all sides of the waggonette.
Two men, Rooney and Springthorpe, dashed through
the flames. The waggonette took .fire and a half
caste, Jack Williams, trying to get out, caught his
toot in the spokes of the wheel and broke his ankle,
and he hung there while the fire raged round him.
When the rescue party picked him up, he was found
hacking- with his knife at the broken limb. Dixon,
whose clothes had been burned off, was still on the
waggonette trying to get a drink out of a tank, the
water of which was almost at boiling point. Sprin°--
thorpe was picked up dead several miles from the
scene of the fire; Rooney was found sitting near the
roadside, almost naked and blinded by the fire. The
five men, Springthorpe, Williams, Rooney, Dixon and
Tommy Reardon (aboriginal), were brought in to
ABRIDGED.
MULG MICK: “To the divil wid book-
lamin', Oi say.’ Oi've read this book
through twice, an’ it's divil a worrud
about a hang-in’ Oi can foind at all, at

the hospital at Boulia, and I was the first to see
them when they arrived. Dixon had died about three
miles from Boulia on the way in. Williams died
within an hour after admission to the hospital.
Rooney lingered for ,a fortnight and partly recovered
his sight, but he suddenly collapsed and died. The
late Dr. P. H. Thornton and the matron, Nurse
Morgan, did everything that was possible for the
men. Reardon did not die; he recovered ultimately,
and the skin on the parts where he was burned is
almost white. He is now working on a station in
this district.
"Key-string”: I can’t tell "Gouger” (B.
19/10/’22) exactly how much cane a man can cut
and load in eig'ht hours, but Peter. Cody’s gang of
eight men filled a 60-ton punt in one day. They
were 14 hours at it. The cane had to be cut, loaded
on to carts (in which operation the gang got some
assistance from eacli of the two carters), drawn any-
thing from 100 to 300 yards, then dumped at side
of punt, and finally carried and stacked on board.
The cane was yearling plant of the Daniel Dupont
variety, and had been “trashed,” i.e., stripped of
all dead leaves. I can vouch for this performance
as I was one of the carters. It happened over 20
years ago -at Somer’s - farm, Upper Richmond River
(X.S.W.). .
WILLIE'S GOOD DEED.
T EACHER: “We all ought to try to make at least one person happy during the week.
Have any of you?”
WILLIE : “I did.”
TEACHER: “Dear child! And what did you do?”
WILLIE: I went to see auntie, and she's always happy when I go home again."
‘J.H.S.”: It has ofteu been duubted that
snakes of different species interbreed in their natural
state, but most old bushmen have at some time killed
a snake which could only be accounted for as the
result of a cross alliance. A remarkable and
thoroughly authenticated instance of mixed mating
occurred on the North Coast (Q.) railway not long
ago, when a red-bellied black lady snake and a
brown Don Juan were caught in flagrante delicto,
as they say in the divorce court. Several usually
sceptical persons had to admit themselves convinced
on the point.
“Key-string”: With a performer like my
entry available 1 can’t give “Worray” (B. 19/IG/’22)
a walk-over in the Skinflint Stakes. I discovered
him at a country cattle-sale on the North Coast
(N.S.W.), where the ladies of the local Red Cross
supplied an outsize lunch at a bob a head. My
nomination, after eating liis fill, found that he nad
quite a lot left, whereupon he not only asked for a
refund of sixpence but actually took the coin. Inci-
dentally, this top-notcher is a J.P., holds thousands
of acres of land, and toots about in his own motor-
car.
* * * *
“Dido”: Somebody mentions the emu as
the fool of the family, and he certainly is a peculiar
goose. Some years ago they had a fine pair in an
enclosure at the Botanical Gardens, Ballarat. One
day the cock bird was found with his head through
the fence, tugging till he threatened to pull his
head off. He was rescued by simply pushing his
face down to where a knot hole permitted of it
being withdrawn. Within an hour the wretched bird
was again in the same predicament. Several times
he was rescued, when endeavoring to stretch his
neck 11 feet, but, as he returned to his adventure
with the fence, a slat had to be nailed over that
particular opening to prevent a fatality. The gifted
bird was next found with his head stuck in a 21b.
jam-tin, and finally he reached his head up to the
top of the high fence, looped it in between two
pickets, and with great difficulty hanged himself.
The only excuse for the bird, mentally speaking, is
that felo de se was his intention from the first.
“Roma” : I’m not butting into- the argu-
ment as to when or how rabbits were introduced
into Australia, but if any Abo. wants to know how
they are introduced into station runs let him ask
Roley Winten, president of the Leichhardt (Q.)
Rabbit Board. His station, Dulbydilla, is netted,
and war on Bunny is one of his hobbies. He w,as
told two rabbits were seen on his property, and
after spending two nights with traps and dogs the
pair—full-grown buck and doe—-were bagged. Each
bore an excellent replica of his registered ear-mark,
“Bung”: “Wendouree’s” green honey (B.
19/10/’22) was garnered solely from wattle-blossoms.
Bush hives, in districts where the wattle is plentiful,
almost invariably have green honey in the spring and
early summer. It is because it is impregnated with
the bitter-sweet flavor of the wattle that early-season
bush honey finds no favor in the market. But its
distinctly Australian tang will do me.
“Mirza”: Can abos. blush (B. 14/10/’22)?
The physiological explanation of blushing is that it
is due to a dilatation of the superficial subcutaneous
blood vessels of the face and neck in the self-con-
scious, the embarrassed or the ashamed. Binglii cer-
tainly possesses the vaso-dilator mechanism, but
rarely experiences the sense of shame; and, further,
any coloration of the cheeks due to a sudden increase
in the blood supply is adequately masked in him by
the layer of pigment. But careful examination of
his nasal mucous membrane in blushful circumstances
shows a heightened color which is quite perceptible.
This is also apparent in the flush of rage, easily
elicited in anyone by the simple process of pinching
his beer.
I- lck : Add this to the queer accidents
list. Jack Charlton, when butchering- at Narromine
(N.S.W.), yarded some fats, swung the double of his
stockwhip over his shoulder, jumped into the
butcher’s cart, and started for home. The whip-
handle dangling beside him caught between the
wheel-spokes, the whip twisted round the hub, and
at the same time the lash became half-hitched over
Charlton’s shoulder. Next the neddy bolted. Jack
was thrown from the cart, and for a hundred yards
was alternately hammered upon the roadway and
whirled through the atmosphere. Then the whip
providentially broke; but by that time Jack had
enough gravel rash and other ailments to keep che
hospital staff busy for weeks.
* * # *.
“W al” : The large water-goanna mentioned
by Begiti (B. 10/8/’22) must be extremely rare,
for, with a couple of decades of Papuan travel be-
hind me, I’ve never seen or heard of one. The
goanna is a frequent, incident in the jungle and
forest country, and in the jungle he often attains
a tremendous size. When at Tiveri (Lakekamu, Gold-
field) in August, 1916, I shot a specimen that taped
Bft. 6in. The miners at Whitten’s store, where the
animal was consigned to the menu of the carriers,
witnessed the measuring. This is the largest go.
I’ve met to date. It was armed with teeth like a
baby-crocodile, and could have easily outfought any
dog on the field. The forest goanna is a smaller
variety, perhaps a different species; and the aquatic
animal “Begiti’s” friend caught pussyfooting was
probably its brother, for the goanna is a fair swim-
mer and not at all afraid of water. The Motu
(Hanuabada) natives, near Moresby, speak of a giant
go. that inhabits the scrubs along the Laloki River,
which they allege has devoured even horses when
hungry. Archie Macalpine, an expert in native lan-
guages and customs, tells of a young horse being
found in the locality with its stomach ripped open.
Close to the carcase were the tracks of a strange
reptile that his Motu boys declared was a giact
goanna. This may have been the “ota ara” of
“Lagani Namo” (B. 27/4/’22),
* * * »
“M.E.S.”; “Ragar’s billy that did not
rust after having had tea boiled in it (B. 7/9/’22)
was not unusual. My father is an eld bushman, and
his billycan never rusts. I have also done a fair
amount of camping, and my billycans after I have
boiled tea in them for a while do not rust either.!
The whole point is, you must not wash off the tannin
before putting the billycan away. It is that which
seems to act as a rust-preventive. Of course, all
billies will burn through in time.
* ■* * *
“FY7”: Tell “Wessel” (B. 12/10/’22)
that Count Beauvoir’s story of the 65 nicks, repre-
senting slain aboriginals, on the stock of the
gun of the late Frank Jardine, of Somerset
(N.Q.), is mythical. I knew all the Jardines from my
boyhood, and among the many Queensland squatters
who were known for their interest in Binghi’s wel-
fare the name of the Jardines ranks high—Frank’s
especially. When the brothers made their famous
overland trip from southern Bananaland to Somerset,
they had more than one brush with the savage blacks
of the Peninsula, but they soon got on to a footine
of confidence and affection, which was never departed
from by either side.

"M.E.S.”: W, A. Stewart in his "\ T Hit
Prowlers’ (13. 17/S/’22) is quite correct when*lie
says the kangaroo thumps with its tail. And “Pinnacle”
(13. 28/9/’22) is in error when he says otherwise.
I have lived practically all my life in the bush, and
have studied the habits of wild animals a good deal.
When the ’roo gets a fright he jumps high in the air.
and tilings his tail down thump on the ground lit;
jumps with his legs fairly wide apart, but his feet
are separated by only six or eight inches when they
flit the ground. It is when he lands that his tail
comes down with that thumping sound. I have tested
it by giving a pet kangaroo a fright and watching the
results.

“Cutter”: “Lampas!” said the store-
keeper. “And what’s lampas?” “Well, he can’t eat
hard tucker,” explained Bill, the assistant, as he
gazed sorrowfully at the sick horse. The face of the
storekeeper brightened. “Oh, that’s all right in-
said. “Save, the oats- just feed him on the straw
chaff.’’ And he went on groaning about the income-
tax.

“Bouragi”: “Magela Bada’s” story of the
Papuan lover (13. 19/10/’22) who winds a certain
snake in his hair at bedtime as a charm to ensure
tlie capture of his best girl may be all right thoiHi
with most of us the risk of being stung comes after
matrimony and not before it. . Still, I prefer die
Binandele method of giving the loved one a chip of
sweet-smelling cinnamon wood to sniff, thereby at
once ensuring the lady’s surrender. This is infallible
and any gay dog on the Mamba found calling on the
lady of the house with shavings of this timber in
liis possession is as liable to hostile suspicion as the
agent for a municipal woodblock contract is nowa-
days in Sydney.

“C. Coral”: When the Torres Strait
islanders first saw flour and rice, in looting wrecked
ships, they' could not “place” the strange products
at all. To rice they attached the native name for
the white clusters of ant-eggs seen all over the
island, and flour became “ashes” in their language.
The apparently useless cargo was capsized into the
sea, while the dusky looters retained and trium-
phantly bore away the bags or other receptacles in
which it was carried. They know better now! But
even to-day the old people still speak of “ant-eggs"
and “ashes” ; and doubtless visiting anthropologists
of the future will produce some curious theory re-
garding natives who (according to their own lan-
gauge) feed upon these unpalatable items.

“Spark Plug”: Now that “J. Jack Tar”
(B. 26/10/’22) has explained how it is that “Tile
Moralist’s” pig (B. 5/10/’22) can drink a bucket of
milk and can fit into the bucket afterwards, let him
think over this: If he weighed the pig before and
after it drank the bucket of milk he would find that
the original poundage of the porker had not been
increased by taking the cargo aboard. In other
words, the pig - and the milk alongside him on the
scales would weigh more than the pig with the same
milk inside him. Whaffor?
THE FASTIDIOUS GUESTS.
LODGER: “Wodger wanter wake me up at

L ADY: “It's them commercials. They're
that stuck-up they won’t have news-
papers for tablecloths, an’ they want,
an early breakfast, so for the love of
the saints give me your top sheet.”
“Bendigo”: Near Keroit (Yic.) we were
digging warrens out of loose sandy soil when we
came upon 14 very old l skeletons and a few abo.
implements. Every one of the skulls had 1 a bullet-
hole fair in the centre of the forehead, and the
bodies had all been pitched into the same hole.
Evidently the scene of one of the old-time instances
of teaching Binghi the way he should go—to Heaven.
BUSH SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dragon-fly and bee are sailing-,
Flitter-flutter,
Bright as butter,
Over grass and garden-paling.
Rolls the sun a merry eyelid,
Who could think it,
Shall he wink it
Not a flower but is beguiled?
Birds like silver bells a-ehiming
Sweetly mingle
Down the dingle,
Half the world’s gone madly rhyming.
Water-brooks dance through the meadows,
Little fishes
Have their wishes,
Shadows kiss their fellow-shadows.
Ponies shake and leap for pleasure,
Turning over
In the clover,
Fat and full of summer treasure.
All can lend of smiles, or borrow....
None so ldnely,
l the only
Pale impatient child of sorrow.
VICTORIA.

with a OUTFIT
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF GETTING IN EARLY
and the Sheep Fly is Beaten before he Starts.
The solid jet of Cooper Sheep Dip, under pressure,
penetrates the wool right to the skin, where it remains
and keeps the sheep immune from the blowfly pest for
from two to four months.
Many large stations have been using the Cooper Jetting
Plant now for over five years, consistently, and they all
speak highly of both the service of the Plant and the
efficiency of the method. They say this Outfit has reduced
losses through the blowfly pest by 90 per cent.
The Cooper Jetting Plant has been worked out to give long service and high efficiency at a
minimum cost. Since the original Cooper Plant was placed on the mar et o er ma e
followed, but none have equalled the combined qualities of the Cooper Outfit.
The Cooper Plant can also be used for crutching—it is all ready to attach two shearing machines
and grinder at any time desired. They can be attached in a few minutes. e engine ca
be used on windmills for pumping water. It will also cut chaff, saw firewood, etc.
Drop us a line to-day and let us send you catalogue and full particulars of both plant and method.

lant adventurer the world over in such cir-
cumstances. And of course he does bring it off.
And when, at the Eastern Front, my most Gracious
Emperor and Master inspected the Naval Flying Sta-
rion, under my command, and shook hands with me
and personally expressed his Imperial satisfaction, I
looked straight into his eyes, and pressed in burn-
ing letters graven in my heart stood:
“With God for Emperor and Fatherland.”
It is not disclosed whether these, the last
words of his book, were written before or
after the Kaiser’s fall. Quite probably the
latter. The author is just that sort of man.
Celts and Teutons
David Wright, in “The Real Value of
Celtic Study” (B. 24/8/’22), ignores the
fact that Goth, Teuton and Celt are all
from the same Asiatic stock. Hence the
genesis of the psychology of the present-day
Briton will not be revealed by the legends,
thought-currents, archaeology or history of
one race any more clearly than it would be
revealed by those of the original stock.
The drift of events, rather than individual
disposition, has caused the Celt to hold
to his own institutions with a tenacity
which surely constitutes a world’s record.
So far as I can gather, at least 2000 years—
more likely 4000 —-were void of communica-
tion between the Highlands of Scotland and
the Basque provinces of Spain. Yet I
have known Scots and Welshmen to meet
Spaniards for the first time, and find very
little interpretation necessary for mutual
understanding. Had the Celts been the
conquerors of races other than their own, no
doubt they would have assimilated some of
the speech of their slaves, even as other
conquerors have shed the purity of their
mother tongue. The term “Celt” did not
originally apply to the breeding of a people,
but to their mode of life. If it were pos-
sible to raise from the grave one of the
first “Woodsmen,” he might tell us of life
m the forest under a patriarchal or phylar-
rhic regime, but the chiliad growths of his
instincts could teach us little in the direc-
tion of moulding ourselves to better suit
existing conditions.
The difference between Celt and Teuton
is but the natural sequence of conditions
which, even at this day, would make toward
the same results. Upon arrival in the vir-
gin lands of Europe, the first wave of
migration diffused, as separate dribblings
chose for permanent settlement separate
districts along the line of march. Eater,
maybe centuries later, another wave reached
the countries chosen by the original wave.
As a general rule, a unity of many thousands
would dispossess small communities of the
lands which their forefathers had settled.
But there were descendants of the original
influx who had made such advances toward
nationhood and civilisation that, with
resultant vast increase of population and
with protective concentration, they pre-
sented a much more formidable front. So
the invaders followed the line of least re-
sistance, and harried the disunited and
weaker peoples of other districts. Thus
we have the first tide of migration holding
its own in Greece, whilst the newcomers
drove the primitive and scattered peoples
to Spain, France or the British Isles.
After etymologists and ethnologists and
archaeologists have taught us of the early
migrations, the Greek or Roman historians
open with the Cimbri in Denmark, and
the Gotlis or the Teutons in Germany,
and along both sides of the Baltic. Later,
Julius Caesar writes of the Seine dividing
Celt and Teuton. Thenceforward, the-
clouds of mystery begin to dissolve, but a
clearer view of the Gelt reveals him to be
at heart much the same man as the Goth
or Teuton. In like manner, the Scandina-
vian sagas and the Hibernian legends are
appeals to the same traits of character. The
Celtic warrior could not have been more
adventurous than the Viking, nor could he
have been more ready to cry: “Give me
liberty, or give me death.”
David Wright tells us that Celts set women
and men on an absolute equality. Yet Julius
Caesar wrote that amongst the Britons it
was customary for a number of men to
herd together and hold their wives in com-
mon. If the mere tribesman stood on equal
footing with the greatest of Celtic kings,
where did the Druids find victims for their
sacrificial fires? If the Celts did not boast of
their achievements, why did they so laud
the leader, who, seeing that his boat’s crew
could not outpace a competitor, cut off his
hand and hurled it to the shore so as to
make good his word that his fingers should
be first to touch Irish soil? If the Celt
acknowledged no private ownership of land,
how could Dirmaid of Leinster contract
to. reward Strongbow and his adventurers
with Irish land? If the Celts regarded hos-
pitality as their first duty, why did the Irish
invade and colonise parts of Wales and
Scotland? The English seaport of Bristol
owes its rise, to the export of slaves to Ire-
land. That import of enforced labor is poor
evidence of hospitality.
. Mr. Wright opines that present and com-
ing generations will benefit bv wider know-
ledge of our remote ancestors. He is san-
guine that the deeper we penetrate toward
bedrock, the more glaring we shall discern
each erroneous piling upon the fundamentals
which constitute the instincts of our race,
“till, the Hindoo and Briton are alike de-
scendants of the same peoples of Persia. The
fundamental instincts of brown man and
white man have one single source. To both
brown skm and white skin, time has intro-
duced new modes of thought until the men-
talities of the two races differ as widely as
the color of their skins. In brief, a man is
the child of his environment, and not an
echo of the thinkings of remote ancestors
BAY WEBB.
Literary Catholics
This vitiating spirit inspires all Ins writ-
ing says S. N. Robinovitz (R.P. 7/9/>22)
with reference to the Catholicism of G. K
Chesterton. To-day Chesterton is probably
the best-known protagonist of the Catholic—
or through the Robinovitz glasses, the vitiat-
ing—spirit in modern English literature:
but for over half-a-century others have been
turning up the same ground. Newman was
the first to put his hand to the plough and
m doing so he got to work on a field that
had lam idle for nearly 300 years, A band
of Catholic writers rallied l’ound the Car-
dinal, inspired by the light of his genius
and the magic of his name. As time went
on people became less and less astounded at
sighting a Catholic name on a book cover.
In the vanguard of this Catholic renaissance
are Francis Thompson, Coventry Patmore,
Lionel Johnston, Alice Meynell, Ernest
Dowson, Cardinal Gibbons, Canon Sheehan,
Matthew Russel, S.J., G. K. Chesterton,
Hilaire Belloc, Shane Leslie, Katherine
Tynan, Mrs. Belloc Lowndes, W. S. Lilly
and many others. All these writers are
hemmed in by Catholic doctrine and morals,
and whether theirs is a vitiating spirit in
modern literature, or whether that spirit lies
with the pagan philosophies which the print-
ing-presses are thundering out every hour, I
leave it to others to judge.
Mr. Maurice Baring scented the new
spirit when, years ago, as a Cambridge
undergraduate, he bought “a new book of
verse by a man named Francis Thompson.”
Relating the incident in his recently-
published book of travel, “The Puppet-show
of Memory,” Mr. Baring continues: “Here,
I thought, is another of the new poets, but
directly I caught sight of ‘The Hound
of Heaven,’ I thought to myself, ‘Here
is something different.’ ” Francis Thomp-
son—-who, according to the scholarly
Canon Sheehan, is the great Catholic
poet—died only in 1907. He was
fathered by the Meynells, who, in 1888,
conducted Merry England. Thompson was
not received with cordiality, by the outside
press, for at that time the dragon so badly
battered by Newman still had a kick left.
The Weekly Register complained that “De
Vere, Wilfrid Blunt, Mrs. Hamilton King
and Coventry Patmore took up quite enough
space on the literary landscape without the
appearance of Thompson.” To-day a change
is apparent, and in nine and a half cases out
of ten, a Catholic gets rid of liis copy if it
is of sufficient merit. But the honor is to a
great extent due to the pioneers of the last
few decades. The revival of the Catholic
spirit has not tended to the treatment of
solely . Catholic subjects: neither have
Catholic authors trailed flowing coat-tails
behind them. The most noticeable feature
of the whole movement is the important part
played by the converts—men like G.K.C. For
one Catholic-born writer it is easy to name
a dozen, converts. This order should be re-
versed in the future, for to-day the poor
Catholic has a much better chance of receiv-
ing a decent education than was the case,
say, 20 years ago.
FRANCIS DOOGAN.
Trollope: and Others
I would advise “Veronal” (B. 27/7/’22)
not to part with his Trollopes at live dollars.
Certainly, the only volumes by this author
I can see in English catalogues this year are
“Ayala’s Angel” and “The Last Chronicles
<of Barset,” both first editions, the first
priced at £2 25., the other at 255. But there
are probably others on the market. This
does not seem very promising, in face of Le
Gallienne’s prediction. Still, there is some
astonishing light thrown on Trollope's work,
from the standpoint of critic as well as col-
lector, _in Newton’s “Amenities of Boolk
Collecting.” Newton, an American collector
of note, and possessor of some of the rarest
and finest work of Dr. Johnson, Charles
Lamb, Dickens and others, has everything
that Trollope ever wrote. His opinion is
entitled to respect when he says that “The
MacDermotts of Ballycloran” and “The
Kellys and the O’Keil.vs” will bring up to
a thousand dollars some of these davs. His
chapter on the most methodical of all novel-
ists is well worth reading—though it
comes as a bit of a surprise after about
200 pages of really priceless book-lore on
Boswell, Dickens, R.L.S., old catalogues and
new prices, association books and the rest of
the holy writ of book-lovers.
“Soldiers Three” and “Wee Willie
Winkie” only bring about six or seven shil-
lings. ,The rage lor early editions of Kip-
ling is comparatively mild when you con-
sider the extraordinary prices catalogued
opposite Conrad, Masefield, George Moore,
R.L.S., and particularly Wilde. Wilde’s
original MS. of his essay and sonnet on
“The Tomb of Keats” {lieu! miserande
puer!) was catalogued early this year at £3O,
and there have been other items even higher
than that. A presentation copy of Mase-
field’s “Salt Water Ballads,” first edition,
was priced at £42 at the same time. It is
not only the men of the ’nineties who are
being rushed by collectors: those of our
own time are receiving some recognition,
too. In Australia, of course, such items as
the above are not known ; but for the col-
lector with the seeing eye some patience, and,
which is most important, the knack of get-
ting in early, there is treasure-trove abun-
dant. And, by no means Only at the aris-
tocratic bookshops, where you pay for other
things beside the book. Edward Dvson was
right in a recent R.P. article on old book-
shops ; the stubby little places in obscure
streets in obscure suburbs are, more often
than not, the richest in rewards. In several
such shops, at various times during this
year only, I have discovered the following,
all in good condition: a first edition of
Masefield’s “Enslaved” for 9d., catalogue
price 12s. 6d.; first edition of De la Mare’s
“Rupert Brooke and the Intellectual Imag-
ination” for fid., market price 10s. 6d ■
“Jude the Obscure,” vol. 8 of the Wessex
Novels, fpr Is. (the catalogue price 355., and
the 18 volumes of this, the best edition of
Thomas Hardy, are priced this year in Eng-
land at £l2 125.) ; Hotten’s thick Rabelais,
with the Dore illustrations, for 9d., 12s. fid
in Castlereagh-street. And a first coloniai
edition —though that is of little value in
itself- —of Rolf Boldrewood’s “My Run
Home.” inscribed by the author, and pre-
sented to the actor, Alfred Dampier, I made
mine for a mere 4s. 6d. There are others,
too, but you can see already what you might
pick up, with ordinary luck.

The Inky Way
Smith's Weekly can usually be relied on to
supply the winner of Sydney’s day-to-day Uncon-
scious Humor Stakes/ “A thirst for knowledge ”
it announced recently*.- “has developed on the part
of readers of the paper that has necessitated the
setting'-up of a special inquiry department, with a
staff detached from the paper’s regular news service ”
One or two samples of the thirst were given and
then: —
“I am thinking of placing myself under some
mental specialist, and have been advised to call on
X.OW ■: That Nelson was no wowser is well known,
nut Vic. s oldest morning journal, the Geelong
Advertiser, hardly did the fair thing by him
when, apropos of the recent Trafalgar Day celebra-
wrote: “A large concourse of people
attended the special religious service, while the
Victory in dry dock at Portsmouth, flew the immoral
signal.
The Parish’’: If this bit iv a row about “of” is
not the exclusive property uv “E.C.” and “E D ”
I would like to say that “E.D.” is half right. The
Australians who do not say uv say iv. Hy experi-
ence m W.A Vic. and N.S.W. leads me to think
that uv is the favorite form. Of course there are
times when either iv or uv is too much trouble,
which is why a leading Collins-street doctor yester-
day asked me to have a cuppatea.
“Blackfriars”: They have now made Bruce Rairns-
father s “Old Bill” into an M.P. for stage purposes
in London, with Bairnsfather himself in the cast.
It affords another instance of how groovy a man
has to keep to sustain a reputation in England.
Bairnsfather simply cannot cut himself adrift from
Ancient William. Nobody would have been game, by
the way, a few years ago, to translate the trench
walrus to the House of Commons, but times have
changed, and none would be scandalised now even
if they found that Bill had assumed the apron and
gaiters of Canterbury’s archbishopric.
“Dido”: The Argus, debating the question “Is the
Australian a reader ?” adduces the apparently very
satisfactory fact that “if .you appeal to the great
booksellers you will find that the mass of reading
matter imported into Australia is enormous.” This
proves that the reading proclivities of Australians
are all that can be desired. Possibly, if the mass of
reading matter that is imported into Australia con-
tained so considerable a quantity of outside news-
papers as to interfere with Argus sales and Argus
advertisements, the condition of things would not
be found so thoroughly satisfactory. As it- is, it is
only the Australian author who suffers, lying prone
under the imported masses, and it is recognised that
the masses are good for his soul.
~ ‘‘A.M.P.” (B. 19/10/’22) practises
the old trick of incomplete quotation. My complete
sentence was, “Psycho-analysis is not mental
analysis; it is the analysis of something deeper
than mind, as that word is generally understood."
Brill uses the word “mental,” as is customary with
his school, to cover the meanings of both “psychic”
and “mental.” But the writer of “Sexualitis”
obviously used “mental” not in the psycho-analytic
sense of “mental” plus “psychic”; and I, clumsily
enough, tried to express that fact. What is wanted
is a new adjective to cover the complete gamut of
cerebral activity. Let me take this opportunity
to say that I cannot answer the scores of letters
which have come to me from all over .Australia and
from Maoriland, since |my letter (“Timiditis”)
was published in The Bulletin. I am answering
the N-S.W. letters, as I can give the names of
reliable doctors who are practising psycho-analysis
in Sydney, but outside this State I know of none
in this hemisphere.
‘■Mi” : Despite “Wilfrido’s” sneer (B.
19/10/22), Phillpotts is an admirable artist,
sti ongly dramatic and picturesque, though some-
times rough and unequal, like the scenes he por-
trays. In his dramas of the countryside yokels
take most of the leading parts, and they are equal
to any depicted by George Eliot or Hardy. As to
Conrad, “the man is great,” says “Wilfrido,” “and
it is blither’ to say otherwise”—but he carefully
sidesteps my various objections to that verdict.
Probably “though the faults were thick as dust in
vacant chambers,” he could see none, for such is
the way with those who blindly swallow a big repu-
tation. But what is this?—“a conflict of emotion
with emotions, a perpetual strife of terrific immen-
sity.” Sounds like a fit of hysterics, but it is only
“Wilfrido”—on stilts. In all seriousness “Wii-
frido’ must be badly Conridden. No doubt he
would be in sympathy with the literary critic of an
English weekly (a lady, alas!), who elegantly des-
cribes herself as “like some thirsty dog, sitting up
with my tongue hanging out, waiting for his
I Conrad’s | forthcoming book.” If that is “Wil-
frido s ’ attitude, I leave him to it, with the part-
ing remark that Bliackmore’s reputation rests securely
upon “Lorna Doone,” alone.
_ 3.T.5. ’: The ol'd war-horse of a journalist,
Dagonet” Sims, died in harness, and, as one would
have expected, with a jest on his lips. Have just
been reading his final three columns of “Mustard
and Cress” (3/9/’22) in London Referee, which
in 45 years he helped to work up from a mere
sporting-and-dramatic Sunday sheet to its present
position of ‘‘the paper that makes you Think.”
(Never once in all that time did he miss a week.)
In his last week he drops into original verse three
times. He retained the Victorian era’s fondness
for a pun, and makes a neat one mixing up Hutchin-
son, the popular novelist, with the European situa-
tion: “Mark Sabre. If Winter Comes, the jingling
of the Mark will be worse than the rattling of the
Sabre.” Then he deals with capital punishment,
women bookmakers, the Shah’s visit, motor-hoggish-
ness and W, S. Gilbert. Also he makes capital out
of his illness: “I was always brought up with the
idea of leading an upright life, but after three
months of sitting upright day and night in the
same chair I have come to the conclusion that you
can overdo that attitude.” And on his 75th birth-
day “a gentleman from Bart’s Hospital started the
day by playfully prodding me with a stiletto—
hitting below the mark. There are other ways I
should prefer to spend the day.” He finished life
with a prediction that “Labor has a better chance
now at a general election than it has had for
years.” Three days later he was dead.
A Satchel of Books
The Great Quest, by Charles Boardman Hawes
(London: William Heinemann). An alleged romance
of certain Yanks who sailed from Boston in 1826
to encounter wild adventures and moving accidents
on the Guinea coast. Opens rather promisingly and
sags away into egregious Deadwood Dickiness."
Captain Quality, by E. A. Wyke Smith (John Lane:
the Bodley Head, Limited). A tale of a highway-
man, and of a disinherited hero who is wrongly sus-
pected of being a Claude Duval, when he was really
raking in prize-money from Frenchmen legitimately
on a privateering brig. Flavored generously with
love and villainy,and Vauxhall and minuets and snuff-
boxes.
Tom Webster’s Annual of sporting cartoons for
1922 (from Associated Newspapers, Ltd., Carmelite
House, London) again proves him to be the finest
natural caricaturist in England. He makes no pre-
tence at draughtsmanship, as inculcated in the
schools; but he draws as naturally as a fish swims,
and he enlivens his Sketches with copious “gags,”
many of which are as funny as his artistry. Aus-
tralians will find some lively comments on Armstrong
and his merry men in this attractive volume.
Andivius Ileduiio, by Edward Lucas White (E. F.
Dutton and Co., New York), tells of the adventures
of a Roman nobleman slightly before the close of the
second century a.d., in the days when' our own ances-
tors were streaking about wealds and marshes inade-
quately attired in woad and skins. Andivius incurs
the enmity of the Emperor Commodus, and has to
dodge about Italy disguised as a slave. His shifts
to avoid being recognised, the perils he evades, the
depths of misery he plumbs, the love and luxury to
which he finally returns, are recounted with a deal of
vigor, and the work may have some value as a his-
torical study of an emperor who delighted in his
gladiatorial prowess.
Bush Bred, by Walter G. Henderson (McCubbin).
The writer of this book is a solicitor in Albury
(N.S.W.), and is not a first offender in authorship.
It is a good little yarn, by a man who knows and
loves his Australia, and if sometimes he takes
liberties with probabilities, it is only necessary
to remember his legal training, and the fact that
there are one or two tricks of the trade that he
has yet to learn. But if it is not the great Aus-
tralian novel, it is a long way from being the worst,
and there are some situations in it that are very
well handled indeed. Sydney, Chinamen, opium,
Central Australia, a nice girl or two, a creditable
villain, a hero and a refreshing amount of bloodshed
keep it going through 27 chapters, some of which
are better than others. There is a foreword by
Viscount Novar, who used to be Governor-General
Ferguson, which recommends the book and the coun-
try of its birth in a friendly fashion, and asks for
more.

“Sucre”: “Macte” (B. 12/10/’22) and
others, re egg-preserving. While white-wash-
ing our hens’ bedroom, I let an egg I had
taken out of a nest fall into the tin of
whitewash. I forgot to rescue it, and it
staved there five months. When the wife
reclaimed it, that egg proved to be as fresh
as a two-year-old colt.

“Geo. Rich” : Add this to the walnut lore
of “Skyrider” (B. 28/9/’22) and “Ivirk” (B.
24/8/’22). In the southern orchard coun-
try of Westralia, walnut-trees come into
bearing in their sixth year. But few are
planted nowadays. Orchardists who once
experimented with them, are cutting them
out and planting export apples instead. _ W al-
nuts, like almonds, are shy bearers in our
fruit district.

“U.P.’s” yarn:—
An Adelaide firm intended to ship by the Dim-
boola three cars to Sydney, and all arrangements
had been made accordingly. Two of the cars had
been placed on board and the third was adjusted foi
the hoist when the dinner-hour signal Stopped opera-
tions. Another few minutes would have finished
the job, and as the vessel was leaving within half-
an-hour every inducement possible, including addi-
tional money, was offered to get the men to work
another five minutes. But there was nothing doing,
and the boat sailed without the third car. It
was a helluva triumph for Unionism.
* * * *
“Winkle”: There is a great wailing from
the 822 carters who carry sand from Fisher-
man’s Bend, Port Melbourne, and sell it. to
the public and to the glass manufacturers:
for the Government intends to rescind its
permission to take the sand away. The
reason given is that the huge excavations
are in land that is ideal for warehouse sites,
and, whereas only Bs. a yard is received by
the Government for the sand, they will have
to pay 6s. a yard when they have the holes
filled in. As is usual, the remedy is being
applied after the evil has been done. *
“Macnade” : The craze for Yankee machine
bookkeeping is due for a bump in Australia
shortly. Two big Sydney companies are
glad that auditors are not too inquisitive.
One has misplaced about £3OOO in its June
balance, and has spent about £BOO in over-
time looking for it; while the other is in a
somewhat similar position. A third co. has
tossed about £2OOO worth of U.S. machines
into the cellar and gone back to the old
system, and this concern’s example has been
followed by a newspaper with a wildly expen-
sive card-system for casual* advts.
“SteOsby”: “O’D.’s” (B. 12/10/’22) re-
marks re the non-completion of Brisbane s
sewerage scheme surprised me. Is it possible
that the local “sugar” boats still load up
their tiers of cans at the wharf, close by
Victoria Bridge, and plough the river and
main twice daily en route to the vicinity of
Cape Moreton? Some years ago there was a
dreadful catastrophe when the outward-
bound “sugar” freighter Kembla fouled an
inter-State liner in the Brisbane River, and
hundreds of odorous cans found a premature
watery grave. It was an umpteen days’ won-
der. When Labor goes probably the “sugar ’
boats will follow suit. It would be an ap-
propriate passing. * #
“T.O.L”: The oldest newspaper agency
in Australasia has been liquidated, but,
Phoenix-like, has arisen in another form, as
“Gordon and Gotcli, Australasia, Limited,”
being, it appears, an amalgamation of the
Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane houses.
The firm, now 70 years old, was founded by
a tall, bony old Scot named Gordon, as un-
tidy a looking man as was to be found in
Melbourne in the ’fifties. Gordon mostly
did his own postal work; he would carry
on his own shoulders the sackful of periodi-
cal literature that arrived on mail days,
until the business expanded and he left
Market-square for a larger building in Col-
lins-strcet. Soon after Gordon was joined
by J. S. Gotch, and the Scotch pioneer
went back to his native country with a sub-
stantial pile.
* # * *
“Stellsby”: A visitor to Port Augusta
might recently have counted 24 transcon-
tinental locomotives standing idle, relics of
a succession of optimistic Governments.
Further, there are 14 surplus goods engines
permanently out of commission, and the Fed-
eral Department of Railways has been un-
able to sell them for scrap. Of course, if
Hughes’s gorgeous unification of gauges
scheme sees daylight, the discarded locomo-
tives could be employed hauling ballast for
the altered permanent-way, failing which
the taxpayers’ money will continue to be
wasted keeping the mechanical Micawbers
in repair. Incidentally, there are 69 loco-
motives for a service which skites of three
passenger-trains each way per week. The
line’s working loss for the last financial
year was £138.192. irrespective of an in-
terest bill of £216,446.
PORTER V. BEER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Commissioner Clapp has set out a rule forbidding
tho passing of any passengers carrying bottles of
beer in their coat pockets. The porters are to stop
all such at the gates.
The public-house they close at six,
And leave us prohibition-cursed.
Peremptorily the wretches fix
The rigid limit of a thirst.
And now these stern restrictions are
To liberty a further bar,
Forbidden by official fates,
Good liquor must not pass the gates.
Last straw of tyranny is this.
The good man who’s a carrier
Of sundry standard pints of bliss,
Is stranded at the barrier,
And be he first- or second-class,
He is informed he may not pass.
For on the drink that gives us vim
They’ve Clapped this regulation grim.
They’ve drawn the line in ways unfair,
On many worthy people here,
The one’s who carry home with cure,
On Saturday their Sunday’s beer.
We see them when the hour is late,
There solemnly before the gate—
Not very seemly the display—
Each drinks to-morrow’s beer to-day.
VICTORIA.

To Avoid Sickness.
To avoid and to overcome sickness of ah
kinds, watch your bowels. Don’t allow old
fermenting food to stay in them for days,
but get it out.
If your stomach is disordered, or your
bowels constipated, if you feel sluggish,
dizzy or bilious, get a box of Chamberlain’s
Tnblets at once.
They act directly upon the liver, regulate
the bowels, invigorate the stomach, cleanse
the system. The result is a relish for food,
increased strength and a clear head.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are good for con-
stipation, sour stomach and gases on the
stomach. A single dose often relieves these
troubles.
The use of these Tablets is not followed by
constipation as is the case with many laxatives.
Instead of weakening the bowels they strength-
en them to act naturally without assistance.
Chronic constipation may be permanently
relieved by Chamberlain’s Tablets. They
have none of the sickening equalities of pills,
and do not produce an unpleasant effect.
Keep Your Bowels Clean.
That listless, tired, drowsy feeling may be
due to poisonous matter lodged in the bowels.
Many folks who always feel tired and only
“half alive” will be surprised how much
better they will feel when they get rid of this
matter which has been poisoning their system
for days.
Nervousness, sleeplessqpss and some kinds
of headaches are frequently signs of poison-
ing of the system through poisons left in the
bowels.
Irritation of the bladder, breathlessness,
so-called weak and fluttering heart, are often
caused by pressure of gas in the intestines—
this gas may originate from decaying food in
the system.
A man is seldom sick when his bowels are
regular, and never well when they are
irregular. Bear this in mind and take
Chamberlain’s Tablets as occasion may
require. There is nothing better. Thqjr
are i 'ld and gentle in their action and
pleas*. to take.
Old Age.
Old age as it comes in the orderly process
of nature is a beautiful and majestic thing.
It stands for experience, knowledge, wisdom,
counsel. That is old age as it should be,
but old age as it often is means poor digestion,
torpid bowels, a sluggish liver and a general
feeling of ill health, despondency and misery.
This in almost every instance is wholly
unnecessary. One of Chamberlain’s Tablets
taken immediately after supper will improve
the digestion, tone up the liver and regulate
the bowels. That feeling of despondency
will give way to one of hope and good cheer.

CHAMBERLAIN'S TABLETS are
invaluable for the relief and
prevention of biliousness. Even
th z most severe attack can be
relieved by this medicine. By taking
an occasional dose of Chamberlain s
Tablets you will prevent future attacks.

Chamberlains
Children’s Ailments.
Children, like adults, are subject to
disorders of the stomach, liver and bowels,
and many of the apparently alarming ailments
of childhood are due to these causes.
Constipation is a common trouble among
children and is often the cause of seeming
stupidity at lessons and also of many an
exhibition of temper.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are invaluable for
children. They are pleasant and safe to take
and absolutely without harsh effect.
Half a Tablet is sufficient for children from
six to twelve; for children under six, one-third
of a Tablet will have the desired effect.
If your child is bilious, if its appetite is
poor and variable, if it is fretful and
nattering, restless in its sleep, you may be
sure that its stomach is out of order and a
few doses of Chamberlain’s Tablets will
quickly set it right.

The first white boy horn at Wellington
(M.L.) was Thomas Rodgers, whose parents
had just landed from the ship Oriental. He
made his. appearance on Feb. 28, 1840, on
the Petone beach, and in recognition of the
honor of being the first pakeha born there
he was presented with 50 acres of land in
the Hutt Valley by the old Provincial Gov-
ernment.
"‘Second Murderer”: Allan Wilkie and
his Shakspearean co. are doing well in
Maoriland, and have “King Lear” in pre-
paration as the next outbreak. I think this
tragedy has not been done in Australia since
William E. Sheridan’s notable performance
in the early ’eighties. Sheridan was an
eminent American mummer with a compel-
ling tragedy stop. His grave is in Waverley
Cemetery, Sydney.
Ashby, A South Aus. naturalist, demanded
at the congress of Ornithologists in Adelaide
that the resolutions against private collec-
tions and permits, which were adopted at the
last Camping-out held in N.S.W., should be <•
rescinded, as being “revolutionary ” and op-
posed to the interests of education. He
contended that private study ought to be en-
couraged. "White, of S.A., and Cayley, of
N.S.W., were against him, however, arguing
that private collecting, whether of eggs or
skins, is quite often wasteful and of no real
value. So the motion was withdrawn, but
the meeting resolved that permits to lona fide
workers should be encouraged, and went on
to demand that Governments set up protected
areas —for both fauna and flora —in every
district.
L. H. Gwyhne, from the inside:—•
Let me correct ‘‘The Rumpus” (B. 21/9/’22) re the
W.A. Railways Death Benefit Fund. The levy made
at the death df each member was Is., not 2s. We
lost 186 of our members at the war and paid their
representatives £40,000, which we feel is some-
thing to be proud of, but this payment did not
affect the stability of the fund in any way. Under
advice from the Government Actuary we have
amended our rules to enable us to establish a re-
serve, and the fund to-day is on a sound financial
basis.
“Z.H.P.” : “King John,” recently revived
by Allan Wilkie, marks one milestone in
the development of the English stage.
Charles Kemble’s production at Covent
Garden on March 3, 1823, was the earliest
of the so-called archaeological revivals. When
Dance tried to persuade John Philip Kemble
to dress his Roman characters a little more
in accordance with antiquity, he replied that
he did not wish to be taken for an antiquary.
Planche, who arranged the revival of “King
John.” had similar prejudices to contend
against. When the actors were shown the
peculiar pot-shaped helmets they had to
wear, they declared that the audience would
roar at them. “And so they did,” writes
Planche; “but it was with approbation.”
He also writes in his “Recollections” that
“receipts of from £4OO to £6OO nightly soon
reimbursed the management for the expense
of the production, and a complete reforma-
tion of dramatic costume became from that
moment inevitable upon the English stage.”
The cast included Charles Kemble as Faul-
conbridge, Mrs. Faucet as Constance, and
Macready as the King.
“Cleveland” : How’s this for the Piracy-
Stakes? I sent for some “Australian
Pilots,” i.e., Sailing Directions issued by the
Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty*
They are advertised at prices ranging from
3s. to 55., a figure doubtless fixed to eliminate
all excuses for ships’ officers not having the
very latest information to work on. When
the bill came along, I found that I was
charged 16s. 6d. each —an increase of 550
per cent, on the published price. A price
list is published in the back of each volume
as a precaution against just such exploita-
tion, but a gun appears about the only thing
that will stop it. I know of a number of
skippers who, sooner than he robbed in this
manner, would snort off to sea, leaving a
trail of blasphemy and scorched atmosphere
in their wake. The cruelty of it is that,
should they be called to account for an error
in navigation, the fact that they preferred
going to sea on their old Sailing Directions
to being plundered would be no defence, and
the finding of the Court would probably play
into the hands of the robbers.
“Blanco”: Every indication points to a
complete wipe-out of the banana industry in
N. S. Wales. The mysterious “Bunchy Top”
is now practically all over the Northern
Rivers (N.S.W.) banana-gardens, and has
spread north -to Corrumbin (Q.). An inter-
esting theory is that the disease is climatic—
the result of trying to grow a tropical fruit
in a temperate zone.
“Frank Clinton” :
One of the. effects of a Pussyfoot triumph in Eng-
land would be to restrict the supply of milk. Owing
to insufficient pasturage, British dairymen are
forced to hand Strawberry what is known as a
“well-balanced ration.” This must contain chemical
constituents suitable for the production of milk,
mixed with a heavy medium to meet the natural
demands of herbivorous animals. The ideal cow-
food is found in brewery offal, truck-loads of which
are delivered daily to the dairies within easy reach of
breweries. The supremacy of Denmark as the land of
the cow”‘is largely attributable to its proximity to
big breweries. Beer, strange as it. may seem, has
played almost as great a part in Denmark’s butter
and cheese production as the careful selection of good
milking stock.
“Australian Exporter”: A Bulletin
writer asserts (B. 28/9/’22) that £60,000
was paid to South Africa last year for wattle-
bark. The following figures are from the
Commonwealth Trade Statistics, for the year
4920-21 : Bark imported from S. Africa,
2191 tons, value £18,723; bark exported from
Australia, 3261 tons, value £46,730. Accord-
ing to the same source of information the
value of leather and leather manufactures
exported to S. Africa during the year was
£77,494. The following figures are also in-
teresting : Exports from Australia to S.
Africa, 1920-21, £3,049,507; imports to Aus-
tralia from S. Africa, 1920-21, £534,118.
Consequently the contention that payment to
S. Africa for bark is “deliberately thrown
away” is somewhat beside the mark—one
should rather refer to it as “a sprat to catch
a mackerel.” As an exporter, I would welcome
a more even balance of trade between the
two countries, for at present the freight rate
to S. Africa is the same as to London, the
reason given by shipping companies being
that they receive practically no back freights
from the Union,

These Smiling Shavers
Now honestly, when you shave, do
you have a silly grin on your face —
like a boy who is told for the first time
by a pretty girlthathe haslovely eyes?
I have had a lot of trouble that way
with artists. Their only conception
of registering satisfaction seems to
be an idiotic smirk. So I have given
up this obvious way of illustrating a
shaving cream advertisement.
At best, shaving is a serious per-
formance. It demands mental concen-
tration rather than blithesome vacuity.
What Mennen Shaving Cream does
is to get rid of the pain and pulling and
meanness. It takes all the fight out of
your beard and enables you to remove
it instead of hacking it off.
Becauseit doesn’thave to be rubbed
in with fingers and contains no free
caustic, it never irritates your skin, and
your face feels wonderful afterwards.
Everyone who has tried Mennen’s
thinks it’s great. I know you will, too.

“L.11.P.”: Apropos Dickens on the stage
(B. 12/10/’22). Harry St. Maur, a Lon-
don comedian, popular in Australia in .the
’eighties, was complimented by Dickens him-
self upon his performance of Traddles in
“Little Ern’ly” at the Olympic in ISG9.
George Fawcett It owe, who from 1854 and
many years after was a prominent Austra-
lian actor-manager, made the hit of his life
as Micawber.
“D.F.”: My friend “Nollig” is right (B.
12/10/’22) about the existence of a tomb-
stone in old St. David’s cemetery, Hobart,
with the names of George and Joseph Kear-
ley on it. But the lettering, far from being
“barely decipherable,” is sufficiently clear-
cut and legible for all essential purposes.
And “Nollig” slips badly in supposing that
the stone was “erected in 1802,” because
George Kearley is recorded on it as dying in
that year. There were no white settlers in
Tasmania in 1802, with the possible, excep-
tion of a few sealers in the Straits islands,
a long way from Hobart. As a 'matter of
fact, the date on the stone is wrong. George,
who was the first white boy born in south-
ern Tasmania, died in 1804 —which was the
year in which he was born.

“L.11.P.”: While watching the Young
Pretender stunt in “The Peep Show,” it
occurred to me how few plays have been
written round the life of Charles Edward.
W. T. Moncrieff’s three-acter, “Bonnie Prince
Charlie,” is the best-known. Fred Yates,
then manage]' at London Adelphi, produced
it on Nov. 22, 1820, and it had a good run.
Yates placed the Prince, and his wife Flora
Macdonald, and O’Smith, the famous Adel-
phi villain, was in the cast. Scott’s “Wav-
erley,” which has the Prince as a leading
character, was dramatised by Calcroft and
produced at the Edinburgh Royal in 1524.
Manv other versions followed, that of 1852
having a long run at the Royal owing to
the acting of Harcourt Bland, a man of
scholarly attainments, whose “Guide to Elo-
cution” is still used in Scotland.
“L.C.” : A Bulletin par. (5/10/’22) tells
of the discovery of a small jar with a repre-
sentation of the Battle of Alma between
two foundation-stones of the Girls’ High
School in Sydney. It. may interest the writer
to learn that some eight or nine years age.
when excavating for a solid foundation on
which to erect an addition to the club pre-
mises at Geelong, Yic., a jar was found that
is apparently the counterpart of the Sydney
one. In this case it seems to have been
buried for over 40 years. - It is in a per-
fect state of preservation, and adorns the
mantelpiece in the club lounge to-day.
“The Deacon”: Isn't it about time the
Sydney evening papers ceased employing
boys as copy-runners from the Divorce
Courts? Just because these infants
are runners for a paper they are
allowed within precincts the Law would
ordinarily chase them off. In my opinion,
and I am no wowser, the gaping and grin-
ning knickerbockered children on the left
of Gordon J. amount to a damned scandal!
“Thor”: Johnny Sandes’s return is an-
other indication that Australia’s big
dailies don’t place much store nowadays
on costly representation in London. There
are three cable services instead of the old
monopoly, and the competition has led to
forms of expansion in the wires that cover
much of the ground formerly left to mail
articles. Arthur Mason gave up the S. M.
Herald’s London work because it was pro-
posed to put him on lineage, and Fink’s
Herald shut down on an elaborate but use-
less London representation a couple of years
back.
E., T. Williams, Geelong (Vic. j Grammar
School’s senior classical master, who died
the other day, had been in the job 26 years,
having succeeded the late J. L. Cuthbertson,
a versifier of some note. Williams, though
he left verse alone, had considerable literary
gifts. For over 20 years he edited the school
magazine; he compiled the School History
and Register for the Jubilee in 1907, and,
at the request of the Old Boys’ Association,
prepared for the press the memorial edition
of Cutbertson’s “Barwon Ballads,” pub-
lished in London in 1913.
“T.P.”: When Vic. Education Director
Frank Tate was in the sixth class in the old
Model School, Melbourne, in the late
’seventies, the late William Hamilton was
his teacher. Tate was a brilliant youngster,
but was inclined to rest on his oars. Hamil-
ton said one day: “Tate, you have brains,
and will go far, if your nose is jambed to
the grindstone now. Watch yourself !” Still
Tate loafed, and for the good of his soul
Hamilton took to him and made him do the
other thing. He didn’t like it, but it
worked. And it left him with an abiding
respect for his master —the man who had
mastered his weakness. When Peacock, who
has the sharpest of eyes for a good man,
wanted Frank Tate as his first Director,
the latter made one stipulation: “Hamilton
as second in command, or I don’t take the
job.”
“Jobber” : To Miss Kendall, mentioned as
an Australian of the fourth generation (B.
5/IQ/’22), I “dips me lid,” as one of the
third. But if you would like to hear of an
even longer-pedigreed Australian, permit me
to introduce Helen Lindsay, of Cootamun-
dra (N.S.W.). a fine healthy specimen of
18 months. Through her maternal grand-
father and grandmother she represents the
sixth and fifth generations respectively of
the native born. ■ The small person is a
g.g.g.-grand-daughter *of the late Mrs. Fran-
cis Oakes. and a g.g.-arand-daughter of the
late Mrs. Blanche Weston, both of whom
were born in New South Wales. On the
father’s side, Helen is an Australian of the
third generation.

OBJECTS OF THE COMPANY.
This Company has been formed for the following purposes:—
(1) To acquire and work the patent rights of Mr. Arnold Nesbitt Macnicol in respect of a series
of inventions relating to the manufacture of reinforced-concrete pipes and all other concrete and
cement products. These inventions have greatly improved both the methods of manufacture, by reducing
costs of production, and the quality of the products. Samples of these pipes are open for inspection
and are thoroughly satisfactory. Already large contracts are open for tender, various engineers in
the different States recognising the superiority of these products, especially the reinforced-concrete
pipes, over those at present on the market. The admirable and efficient joints are notable features and
will fill a long-felt want. Satisfactory reports have been made on these inventions by Mr. Harry
Wilson. Consulting Engineer of Melbourne; Professor Kernot, Melbourne University, and Mr. A. A.
Hargrave, Consulting and Construction Engineer, of Sydney.
(2) To acquire and work patent rights for Victoria in respect of the manufacture of Cement-
Mortar for sale ready-mixed, and also the trade name of “Cemorta.” Already a company has been
successfully floated in Sydney to work these rights for New South Wales. The universal opinion of
architects and builders is in favor of this enterprise, and the supply of this product will be a great
boon to builders.
(3) To acquire and work very valuable sand and blue-metal deposits at Altona, near Melbourne.
This area has been thoroughly tested by shafts and bores, and the quantity and quality of the sand
proved beyond doubt. The sand will be used both in the manufacture of “Cemorta” and the cement
and concrete products, and the blue-metal in the concrete pipes, etc. The site is within 11 miles of
Melbourne, and a railway line runs right into its boundaries.
(4) To undertake general concrete construction work, more especially in relation to large buildings
and public works.
The Directors are satisfied that all the above enterprises can be carried on at a satisfactory profit.
The Vendor’s shares are locked up and not delivered until the Company earns 10 per cent, on
its paid up and subscribed capital.
The Company will work the Macnicol patents in Victoria, but will be a parent Company in respect
of subsidiary companies to be formed in all the other States to work the rights there. For this reason
alone this Company affords an excellent investment, as it will be a' holding Company with paid-up
interest in all the subsidiary companies, and may also receive cash consideration.
The net value of the sand deposits at Altona alone, on independent valuations, exceeds the
paid up and subscribed capital, namely £140,000, without allowing any amount for the valuable
patent rights.
The minimum subscription on which the directors may proceed io allotment is 40,000 shares of
£1 each, payable 5/- on application and 5/- on allotment.
In this abridged Prospectus the requirements of Section 88 of the Companies Act 1915 have
not been fully conmlied with. Copies of the Prospectus and Forms of Application for shares may he
obtained from the Brokers, or Secretary of the Company. Applications for shares will proceed only
on one of the forms of application referred to and endorsed upon a printed copy of the Prospectus.

THE HENRY LAWSON
MEMORIAL.
We have received the following:
Town Hall, Sydney,
3/11/1922.
The Editor “The Bulletin,” Sydney.
Dear Sir, —At the last meeting of the
Executive Committee of the Henry Law-
son Memorial Fund, it was decided that
the memorial should take the form of a
statue, and if sufficient funds are avail-
able also to provide a scholarship at the
Sydney University.
It w 7 as resolved that the Lord Mayor
should open a fund, that the press be
asked to open their columns for sub-
scriptions, and that “The Bulletin” be
asked to open a special “Bulletin” Henry
Lawson Fund, owing to that paper’s
association with Henry Lawson’s work,
and its unique circulation.
In pursuance of this resolution, the
Lord Mayor desires me to ask if you can
see your way to open a subscription
list in your columns. The Lord Mayor
feels that your help in this direction
will materially assist the fund, and will
be highly appreciated by the Executive
Committee.
Yours faithfully,
W. G. LAYTON,
Joint hon. sec. Henry Law son Memorial
Fund.
Contributions should be addressed to The

Athenaeum Hall The Hector Lightfoot Family
Suppe’s charming opera “Boccaccio” has
always suffered the indignity of weak lib-
rettos, and a witless English adaptation by
the late H. B. Farnie has been against it
in this country. Allen Bindley’s plucky re-
vival of the French classic, at Melbourne
Playhouse, offers no excuse for the story and
comic “business” of the opera, but it should
be a welcome reminder of many sweet musi-
cal airs and graces that nowadays sound
like quotations. A mostly amateur perform-
ance, staged for Race Week only, and
brightly staged at that, includes several good
voices and stage figures among the princi-
pals, a numerous chorus and a young ballet
which is a light-hearted entertainment in
itself. Some of the dancing effects on Satur-
day were a pleasure, like the solos by Pau-
line Bindley (who added what sounded like
two modern British ballads to the French
score), and some of the concerted numbers
in the latter half of the show. An ela-
borately concerted piece in the second act,
where Lambertuccio is up the tree, was not
the only example of good, all-round work.
By this time the production should
have thrown off the nervousness that
impaired the harmony of the first perform-
ance, and reduced one or two voices to half
their natural volume, especially at the out-
set. A notable offender on the other side
of the account was a strenuous tenor, who
forced his sympathetic voice beyond require-
ments in emphasising the fact that he was
a more educated singer than talker, his dic-
tion in dialogue being painful.
*** n • #
Pauline Bindley, who has an appeal in
her soprano, played Fiametta capably, though
without much vivacity. Tall, slender Marion
Marris, in the name-part, wanted a contralto
instead of a mezzo to make her a quite
satisfactory amateur in the part. Dorothy
Firmin, as Isabella, gave a good voice and
a professional finish to her portion of the
entertainment. Connie Coppin put some
vigor into her comedy: the major-domo
filled the bill, and the male comedians made
something much Better than the very worst
of the poor material the librettist gave them
to handle. Bindley ventures at the Play-
house deserve encouragement. Comic operas
of recognised musical pretensions are re-
vived, and come as reproofs to the manage-
ments that stage trumpery
shows, possessing no recommendations except
legs, showy dressing and what the advt.
says about them. “Boccaccio,” by the way,
also has legs worth remembering.

hothouse songs, but she is more efficient on

whose mystery even, the advt. fails to un-
ravel.
Melbourne opinions differ as to the quality
of attraction in “Mary” at Her Majesty’s,
and “The Peep Show” at the Royal, accord-
ing to how the disputants have been brought
up to regard things. There is something
to be said for both of the J.C.W. medleys,
and as much to be urged in the way of cold
criticism, not to mention all the things which
are best left to the imagination. Just now
differences don’t really matter, seeing that
visitors from the country' are eager to be
fed somehow. Later on the question will be
reopened, and the cash-boxes of the friendly
rival establishments will deliver the casting
vote.

At Melbourne King’s the rugged charm of
“The Sentimental Bloke” tightens its grip
on the populace in general, and strengthens
its stranglehold on the girls in particular.
One day it will presumably be shipped across

has started a poetic drama of its own, racy

thies.

Vidor has the comparatively easy task of
assuring her neglectful husband of her readi-
ness to become the brightest spot in his life.
Whether a wife should kiss and never tell
is the problem involved in “Stolen Moments,”
which is now trading on the credulity of

is Rudolf Valentino, whose manly beauty is

Majestic audiences also discover points about
“Sweet Alice Calhoun” in a mining yarn
entitled “Rainbow.” The Britannia is rely-
ing for a week’s revenue on “Too Much Busi-
ness.” a yarn wherein Rufus Wallingford
could improve his financial education. At
the Melba “The Good Provider” is full of the
suddenly discovered importance of dad in
the family.

Norman Lindsay’s technique, as displayed
in his latest exhibition at Melbourne Fine
Art Society, is as astonishing as ever. It is
impossible not to admire the riot of life and
the effects of color and light in “The Carni-
val,” for example. The figures, moving in
an insurgent passion, are grotesque, and
even bizarre details in themselves, but com-
bine in a broad and enchanting design. Else-
where, the same harmony attracts the eye
and wins regard for subjects where the
artist’s pre-occupation with one idea has a
pedantically pagan appeal. “King Francis I.”
is a fine drawing, rich in pictorial qualities,
but the appointments of the customary Lind-
say naiad, are over-emphasised. Lindsay’s
goddesses are buxom and big-busted to such
an extent that the appearance of a nymph,
comparatively immature in expression and
development, as, for example, the charming
“Sun Hat” (No. 17), comes as a joyous sur-
prise. “The Sun Hat” is an exquisite little
effort. The flesh is beautifully painted, and
the drawing represents the artist at his best.
On the whole Lindsay has scored another
decisive success. People instructed in the
difficulties of water-colors must be impressed
with the dexterous handling of his washes
and the subtle gradation of tones that is so
strikingly realised in the background of the
delicious “Theme from Mozart.”

F. Latimer and H. Sennett are making a
modest display of their art at Melbourne
Athenmum. Latimer’s best is a self-portrait
which is surprisingly vivid and alive. A
near-by study of an old gentleman holding
a book is equally promising. The artist
employs pastels unconventionally in the de-
piction of a brass bowl, whereof the high
lights are very accurately recorded. In
landscape Latimer is but a moderate re-
porter. It would be difficult to live on amic-
able terms with some of his beach scenes
around Port Phillip Bay. Sennett, pre-
sumably an ex-soldier, fills up a lot of his
wall-space with souvenirs of trench life in
France and Flanders. The canvases are
fairly interesting, but are artistically inferior
to several of his bush scenes, among which
“The Landing—Black Spur” is the most
attractive.

At Sydney Theatre Royal Kitty Reidy

It is two months since the curtain at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney, went up upon the gates
of “Cairo,” and the audience sat back to

ler, wandering minstrels, clowns, beggar-
maids, date-sellers, (Chinese spies, mutes,
jugglers, pilgrims (singing and otherwise),
harem girls, dancers, camels, jackals, palace

At Sydney Tivoli the goods range
from jazz right up to Ethel Hook,
The latter’s little concert-party, by the way,
has achieved a sensational degree of popu-
larity with all classes of Tivoli patrons.
Gene Gerard is doing great business as a
tamer of lions, and Colleano, the wire-
walker, provides plenty of thrills. The new-
comers, Jones and Partner, are tolerable,
and would be more so if N. S. Wales hap-
pened to hav r e a censorship of chestnuts.
At Sydney Lyceum Tom Meighan is a
scream, in fact a howl, in “A Bachelor
Daddy.” Hobart Bosworth is the brutal
deep-sea skipper in the support flicker, “The
Sea Lion. “The Butterfly Girl,” at Hoyt’s
Australian, emphasises the fact that a flap-
per cannot live by jazz alone. Doris Keane
sustains the star role in “Romance,” at the
Haymarket. “Over the Hill” has reached
its tenth moanful week at the Globe. The
Gish sisters are still conspicuous at the
Strand as the “Orphans of the Storm,” and
Charlie Chaplin has opened at the Crystal
Palace as one of “The Idle Class.”

Sydneysiders prefer to take their plea-
sures in the open air this warm weather,
and • the promoters of the All Australian
Exhibition at the Showground are meeting
that demand by running vaudeville concerts
afternoon and evening on the lawn adjoin-
ing the Hall of Industries. Under Bob
Strother’s direction, many old favorites have
done their bit during the week here, includ-
ing Fred Bluett, Little Edna Davis, Charles
Smythe, Phillis Hazell, Elsie Peerless, Henri
Staell, Bus Garling, Henry Bishaw’s ukulele
trio and G. Vern Barnett. The grounds are
well lighted at night, and the humble bob
disbursed at the gates admits patrons every-

In a quiet week at Adelaide, Mary Pick-
ford’s double work in “Fauntleroy” gains
unusual notice. It is immensely clever, but
the lady has sacrificed her art to her vanity,
for she never succeeds in looking like the
kid intended. Her acting as the mother
shows possibilities open to her in the future.
Wondergraph has an otherwise unimportant
story of a girl who somehow “found her
soul” after “orgies of lust and luxury’’
(which, it is hardly necessary to say, do
not get adequate representation on the
screen). West’s scored during a brief sultry
spell with one more film of the frozen North-
West. The Prince of Wales has had a
short monopoly of the spoken drama, with
Eugenie Duggan as a dipsomaniac at the
Cross Roads; though Stiffy and Mo, at the
Majestic, also introduce a kind of dramatic
sketch into the variety programme. Some-
thing quite unusual is an official eclipse film
at the King’s, showing the scientific prepara-
tions and something of the fire-stream effect
seen in Centralia, where the eclipse was
total.
“Vine”: “Marminga” (B. 26/10/”22)
might have mentioned that Sydney Public
Library contains a steel plate engraving of
Mrs. O’Flaherty, nde Elizabeth Winstanley.
It appears in Halliwell’s edition of Tallis’s
“Distinguished Shakspearean Actresses ana’
Actors” (pub. 1851), and Elizabeth is shown
in the character of Mistress Quickly, in
which r6le (and others) she starred with
Charles Kean. The lady left no children,
but an aunt and other relatives are still on
deck in Sydney.

“Whitebait” : If Herbert La Martine, the
stair-dancer at Melbourne Tivoli, is identical
with the person of the same name who ap-
peared at the same house just about 15
years ago, I congratulate him on having
changed his form of entertainment. The
Herbert of yore used to twirl a silver rod
to music. He was billed as the “world’s
greatest baton-spinner,” or words to that
effect. The Bulletin of the time was not
unfair to the artist when it said that “in
the folly of spinning a baton until it re-
sembles a wheel in motion, Herbert has
acquired a proficiency that excites commis-
eration for himself and the audience.”
“Second Murderer”: I think “Pitt
Streeter” is much to blame for suggesting
alliterative variants of the “Silken Socks
of Infidelity” (B. 2/11/’22). The publicity
pundits who perpetrate the picture puffs in
the Sunday papers are sure to take the tip.
Soon we’ll be getting the “Prurient Passions
of the Picture Peaches” or the “Luscious
Lingerie of Los Angeles.” The Lord knows
these torrid tripe terriers are turgid enough
already.
“Pitt-streeter”: Marie Tempest is bowing
to the inevitable. She has been appearing
in New York as a widowed lady journalist,
the mother of a worthless son. One N.Y.
commentator remarks of her performance,
“In lighter mood she is still herself, but as

PRINCESS ,” AT
SYDNEY
ROYAL.
Hugh Steyne as Nitchero.
an emotional actress she seems always an
actress —artificial in the extreme.” Sydney,
with all its faults, would never have heaved
that brick at her.
“Gat'd”: “Fax” (B. 26/10/’22) asks
where the J.C.W.’s end and the ,T. and N.
T.’s begin. The answer is that the J.C.W.’s
ended long ago. An imported lady in “The
Peep Show,” presented “by J. C. Williamson,
Ltd.,” put the position pithily when respond-
ing to a clamor for more of her songs. Trip-
ping to the footlights, she said: “The Messrs.
Tait have forbidden us to take encores.”
“0.K.”: Only in one instance does Roland
Hogue, who plays the rather weak-minded
hero in “Mary,” reveal himself as a true
Australian. One might take him to be
Americanised-English until he calls after
Maude Fane, as she is going upstairs,
“Maireee.” The conversion of Mary into
Mairee has always been a specialty of Aus-
tralian twang. It’s the test of the real
McKay. Evelyn Scott, of old, had the
twang very badly, and, as luck would have
it, she was required to sing the “Little
Mary” song in one of the musical comedies.
She made Mairee of it, as a matter of course.
A touch of twang was the rule, rather than
the exception, with native talent on the
stage in those days. Florence Young,
before she went on her European travels,
was a very marked case. A gifted young
singer and actress who lately reminded us
of what Florence Young used to be—Strella
Wilson, to wit —had an unlovely trick of
sounding some of her y finals as though they
were double e. It was about the only fault
in her strong, clear diction.
“.T.H.” (London) : Somerset Maugham’s
“East of Suez,” now at Her Majesty’s, looks
a winner. It is impossible to book seats
less than two months ahead —a thing that
has been unknown in London theatrelancf
since the Armistice days. The play itself
is pure melodrama; the acting’s the thing.
Meggie Albanesi is being acclaimed by Walk-
ley, of the Times, and other critics as an-
other Sybil Thorndyke. The days of the
U.S. crook drama are numbered. The big
hits in “straight” plays now running are
nearly all by English playwrights—Milne,
Somerset Maugham, J. M. Barrie, Gals-
worthy, Pinero and Bennett.
“Filkoil”: Profound is Asche’s contempt
for the chattering dunces who infest the
theatre. I super-
ed for the mass-
ive mummer when
he produced “An-
tony and Cleo-
patra” in Perth.
It \yas the scene
where Antony and
his captains, after
a night’s debauch
with Cleopatra and
the rest of the
girls, are awak-
ened by the Roman
bugles and creep,
shamefaced and
blear-eyed, back to
camp. All of us
were in our places ;
Oscar on his couch

gave the signal and
out went the house
lights. Immediately
from the audience
came that peculiar
theatre . noise of
mingled laughter,
chatter and excited
anticipation. Had
the curtain gone
up then the effect
would have been
completely spoiled.
Quickly withhold-
ing the signal for
the rag to ascend,
Asche said : “Wait!
Wait till the swine
finish!”
“The Sentimental
Bloke,” at Melbourne
King's.
Les Gordon as ’Erl).
“Norbell”: Speaking of “film personality,”
I saw a bellow-picture the other night, “Why
Girls Leave Home,” and spotted Claude King
in a principal role. I-Ie was in Australia in
1909-10 as leading man for Nellie Stewart,
in “Sweet Kitty Bellairs,” and subsequently
made a good fist of King Charles in “Sweet
Nell” and the melancholy Jaques in “As
You Like It.” Though a polished actor,
King cuts a very wooden figure in the fillums,
but so many good stage mummers seem to
get quite out of focus in front of the camera.
“T.W.”: It was the correct wheeze when
Santley came to Australia to declare, as
“0.K.” does (B. 26/10/’22), that the best
baritone in British musical history had run
to seed. I cannot dispute this, having been
too young then to take an intelligent in-
terest, but if it was so, his voice must have
undergone a wonderful recovery when I
heard him, 14 years later. No Englishman
among hundreds of good baritones, and only
Battistini and Sammarco among the Italians,
equalled his rich mellow ring and sure poise.
The best among many fine baritones who
followed Santley in Australia, William
Paul, Fred Ranalow, W. A. Peterkin, Robert’
Parker, Andrew Black and Arthur Middle-
ton, have none of them approached him.
Santley may at one time have studied with
Garcia, as “0.K.” mentions, but most of
his study was done under other maestri
in Italy, one of them the celebrated Nava.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : Byron is the latest im-
mortal to be maltreated by the film-man.
With pain I read that “Seven Pulsating
Acts of Passionate Drama” have been woven
round “The Amours of the Voluptuous
Genius” ; likewise, that “Last Century’s Noble
Sheik sent a Thousand Women Crazy.” The
Sheik again! How peerless is the Los
Angeles touch!
“Gnarek”: I haven’t seen it mentioned by
the press-agents who do the dramatic notes
for the dailies that Asche’s “Cairo” was ori-
ginally christened “Mecca.” Scenting trouble
with the peoples of the East, the Censor in-
formed Oscar that some other label would
be preferable. However, the publicity gained
by the resultant controversy was worth
having. Personally, I wonder that Asche
didn’t call his pageant “Baghdad.” Perhaps
he didn’t want to give a handle to the
revue miscreants who burlesque his work,
and to whom his pronunciation of Baghdad
is a source of unholy joy.
“C. Ockney”: Dorothy Dix, who has gone
to law with her London manager for billing
a fellow-performer’s name in larger type
than her own, is the handsome brunette
whom Australia saw 10 years ago as the
heroine in “Ben Hur.” She is now appear-
ing at the Duke of York’s, where, according
to a London critic, she has made “the
hit of her career” in a piece called “The
Broken Wing,” described by its American
authors as “a colorful comedy of modern
Mexico.” She supplies a good deal of the
color as Inez Villera, a damsel of Spanish
descent.
“0.K.”: Talking of noticeable blemishes
in musical comedy performances, why does
that bright and intelligent young actress,
Madge Elliott, put out her arm like a sema-
phore and point at the person she is con-
versing with? She does it instinctively, as
though she were dancing. And with her
there is a tendency to clip her words in a
quite society manner, and dispose of her sen-
tences rather hastily, instead of getting full
value out of them. The striking difference
between dainty Madge Elliott and her danc-
ing partner, Cyril Ritchard, is that the lady
seems to mistrust herself as an actress,
whereas the young man’s self-confidence is
so remarkable that it seems still more re-
markable in being merely easy, instead of
aggressive.
“Gard”: I can vouch for the fact that
Harry Rickards never attempted to cut Marie
Lloyd’s salary (B. 26/10/’22). Marie’s con-
tract provided for six evening performances a
week and matinees “as required.” [Satur-
day matinees were the rule in those days
on the Rickards circuit, and occasionally on
holidays without extra pay. If Marie did
not appear at any particular matinee there
might be an argument, but the “Guv’nor” was
the last man to take his with a
knife on the salary sheet.
“Nella”: Before Lawrence Grossmith
finished his run of “Ambrose Applejohn’s
Adventure,” at the Sydney Criterion, the
comedy had changed its name to “Captain
Applejack,” a much better title. It’s a
heavy handicap for any play to have a
cumbersome label. Grossmith’s methods re-
call William F. Hawtrey, just as his pirate
play is reminiscent of “A Message from
Mars.” Had the latter comedy been branded
“Horace Parker’s Peculiarities” it would
never have made the hit it did with the
“Mars” appellation.
“Flyman”: There is talk of Lorna and
Toots Pounds returning'to Australia for a
season. Which reminds me that the in-
teresting pair made their first appearance
in a revival of “A Midsummer Night’s
Dream” at the Princess’s Theatre, Mel-
bourne, Lorna being an eight-year-old Fairy
and Toots a Cobweb of six. Gulliver, man-
ager of the Palladium, gave them their first
chance in London, where they have been
headliners for years.
“0.K.”: David Bispham (B. 2/11/’22)
ended his career by quitting the operatic
stage for the song-recital platform. His
Quaker ancestry was suggested in his grave
personality and its Englishness by his name
and his pronunciation of it. But why did
the Bisphams ever drop the p and call them-
selves Bishem?
“Nollig”: “The Smallest Theatre in the
World,” the invention of a Frenchman named
Tanagra, has arrived in Hobart, direct from
Noo Yark. The theatre is about Bft. square,
the stage is 2ft. by 15in., and by a cute
mechanical arrangement the living perform-
ers appear to be about 6in. tall. The
diminutive playhouse floats on to Sydney in
December.
“J.F.H.” (London): London Morning
Post remarked recently that it would like
to see a company composed entirely of Aus-
tralian players come to London. “They
would be welcomed,” said the Post, “and it
would be extremely interesting to see if
they would make any useful contribution
to theatrical art.” To which Hugh .J. Ward
replied that “he did not think Australia
could export a company which could do
justice to itself in a London theatre.” Why,
he didn’t explain—possibly he will go into
particulars when he returns to the Com-
monwealth. Ward is also credited with the
somewhat surprising statement that his new
firm “is working in collaboration with
Madame Melba in the concert-hall business.”

phraseology. Neither will “the smTarti*

are not developed enough,” it seems.
THE SYDNEY TIVOLI.
Gene Gerrard as the zoo attendant who
claims to he the keeper of the kanga-
roos and the "Dang-er-ous .”
“Two Seas” ; “0.K.” writes (B. 26/10/’22)
that “ ‘The Stirrup Cup’ was familiar in
the mouth of Santley 50 to 60 years ago.”
I remember Santley singing “The Silver
Cup” in the ’eighties, and isn’t that the
song “0.K.” means? I can also recollect
Santley and Sims Reeves in the duet “All’s
Well” at the Alexandra Palace, and although
I was so small that. I had to stand on a
chair to see them, I can never forget the
furore that their singing aroused.
“J.F.H.” (London ) : Harry Lauder had
a crowd of old friends and admirers to see
him off on his third professional trip round
the world. America comes first, followed
by Australia and M.L. Harry is going to
keep a journal this time, and make it the
basis of a book entitled “Round Again.”
There are some new songs in his outfit, but
he finds by experience that there is a much
greater demand for the old favorites. Which
reads as if he doesn’t think much of the
new lot.
“0.K.” in an appreciative mood: —
Wee Georgie Wood, who has started on his return
journey, was promptly recognised in Australia as a
vaudeville performer without a rival in his line of
business. There has been nobody quite like him.
One is reminded of Little Gulliver, a pigmy with a
loud coarse voice who used to be starred in J.C.W.
panto, years ago. What a burlesque the mock-
juvenile Gulliver would have made of “Black Hand
George” and “Nobody Loves Me”! No precocious
yoUngster whom we have seen in “Little Lord
Fauntleroy,” or any other comedy with a good hoy
part in it, could have sounded the whole gamut of
childish feeling as did Wood in his sketches, or have
put the same matured intelligence and art into his
stage business. The marvel was that so good an
actor should have been able to look the small-boy
parts and retain the juvenility of spirit, bearing,
manner and facial expression which accorded with his
figure. The Peter Pan of vaudeville! Even his
hoarse voice was as natural to his stage character as
the rest of him, and some of his gentlest strokes of
humor were gems of art. Take, for instance, his
reiterated assurance in “The Nursery” (the weakest
of his sketches) that he earned 30s. a week at his
last place. “Mind you, I only got 10 —but I earned
30,” he eventually adds as an afterthought. It is
the perfection of acting. And his Wee Macgreegor!
Compare the neat kiddie who has just received 10s.
from his grandmother—one shilling for every year
of his age—with Harry Lauder’s “Saftest of the
Family,” even conceding Lauder an allowance for
every extra year of his age. What a broadly humor-
ous stage picture of a cunning half-witted Scawtcu
laddie was the Saftest, as Lauder first showed him
to us, and how absolutely realistic was Wood's Wee
Mac! The little man may have studied some tricks
in the Lauder school of Scottish comedy, but his
way of performing them was his own. There is no
apparent reason why Georgie Wood should not con-
tinue uniquely convincing for some few more years.
He was understood to be only 25 when he came here
(if he really had, as per advt., a birthday last week,
he was 26), in spite of fairy-talebearers in the pro-
fesh who made him out to be 40 on the strength of
alleged recollections. And when he ceases to look the
boy-leader of the Black Hand Gang he should be an
actor of distinction in older characters suited to
his stature.
THE VOICE OF THE CHARMER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“There are at least three things of which the
player must think simultaneously, even in moments
of swiftest action or highest passion: First, to main-
tain the stage ; second, to listen to his own voice;
third, to feel the emotions of the character.” — (h-cnr
Asche, in Sydney Sunday Times.
Some mummers can’t maintain the stage,
Of Thespian art they’ve got no notion ;
Nor can they simulate wild rage,
Or wallow in their own emotion ;
But let’s he happy and rejoice,
Each actor loves to hear his voice.
With leaden dagger, wooden gun
Or Brummy sword he’ll act like blazes;
Completely happy when he’s done
If but one god's applause he raises.
Each mummer finds a strange delight
In listening to his voice all night.
“A letter, sir.” Perhaps his part
Has but three banal words like these;
But note with what painstaking art
He does his bit and tries to please,
As, posing ’neath the sizzling are,
He listens to his own remark.
All actors, good or rotten, share
This providential recompense,
And carry with them everywhere
A most indulgent audience;
The house may yawn, completely bored,
Loquacity’s its own reward.

A WOLSELEY TEN
recently broke the 24 hours* record at Brooklands,
and with it broke 69 others. A Standard Model
Wolseley Ten beat the previous performance by
nearly 50 per cent., and the previous holder was
a car of eight times the Wolseley capacity and
six times its rated horse-power.

Such a thing has never happened before, and
you will concede that we have the right to

Discussion as to whether Eurythmic is, or
isn’t, the horse he was when lie won the Sydney Cup
ended with his defeat in the Melbourne Stakes. He
looked rather stiff and sorr.v in the birdcage before
the event, and although the market seemed to pro-
test that there was nothing wrong, his running in
the Stakes utterly belied the 7 to 4 on he started at.
Come to think of it, Eurythmic has never reasserted
his former greatness since his failure in the New-
market Handicap, though he certainly did an
apparently great thing in winning the Futurity
Stakes a week previous to
the Newmarket. He was
off color at the Randwiek
Autumn meeting, where
Beauford got undue credit
for downing the chestnut,
and it now appears that
his form has never recov-
ered its old complexion.
The time was not com-
paratively good for the
Melbourne stakes. It was
lfsec. outside the record
for the 10 furlongs, where-
as the Derby was the fast-
est ever known at Flem-
ington, and the Hotham
Handicap, run over the
same distance, was timed
within ljsec. of the ques-
tionable record attributed
to Comedy King. The
champion has faded in-
deed. Nevertheless, he
beat David, FurMns. Speci-
alty, Purser, Stare and
Honey Bee in the w.f.a.
go.
J. L. REILLY, a
Victorian racing
identity.
The Derby that Whittier won was, for the most of
the journey, a question of the stamina of Cliffdale,
who, by the way, had been withdrawn from the
Melbourne Cup as though he were not worth con-
sidering-. In the Derby the son of Shepherd King
had a lead of lengths at the half-way post, and it
was not until the field w r as rounding the turn for
home that Wallace Mortlake, who had always been
next, or next but one, to the pacemaker, took the
lead from Cliffdale and Anton King. Whittier was
handy, and when he shot out everybody knew the
winner of the Derby. Whittier came with the same
brilliant and timely run that won him the Caulfield
Cup. But of the others, Cliffdale outstayed Anton
King and Wallace Mortlake, whilst Soorak was
retaining his old position of nowhere.
Excuses for Soorak’s bad showing would be absurd,
but to argue that he is as inferior as this perform-
ance made him appear were ridiculous. A bad start
put him at a disadvantage because the pace was hot
from the outset, but it also served to prove his lack
of ginger last Saturday. He never seemed to want
to get near the front. In the birdcage a couple of
hours before the Derby anybody would have chosen
Whittier in preference to Soorak—-the one spry and
alert, the other strangely drowsy for a three-year-old
in the Spring. This was not the gay and eager Soorak
who won the Caulfield Guineas from Whittier, and had
only been narrowly defeated by Rivoli after trying to
run away with Sydney Derby. Rivoli, in the Mel-
bourne Stakes, had vindicated the Randwiek form
by running Harvest King close. Why shouldn’t
Soorak put up a spectacular show on Saturday, and
probably win? Indisposition was the only explana-
tion of his dulness in the race.
After the Derby there were many old shrewd heads
to doubt whether Whittier, for all his apparent ease
in spurting away with the Derby as he had spurted
away with the Caulfield Cup, would prove equal to
an extra half-mile in the Cup. There have been so
many horses, from three-year-olds to aged, that coulu
romp home over 12 furlongs, “full of running,
whilst lacking the necessary oellows to carry them
through a fast two-miles’ job. Amberite, in 189 i,
won tne Sydney Derby. Uauilield Cup and Melbourne
Derby, but he was no two-miler. In the Melbourne
Cup another three-year-old (Aurum) gave him a
stone and a beating, Aurum’s weight, Bst. 61b., being
the heaviest ever imposed on a youngster, (laulus
and The drafter fought out the finish lengths ahead
of Aurum. Paris and Hjmettus, each twice victorious
in a Caulfield Cup, made the same number of dire
failures in a Melbourne Cup. As recently as last
year Furious won the Derby brilliantly by three
lengths, but in the Cup it was Harvest King, a
moderate third in the Derby, who finished lengths
ahead of Furious, though he was fairly beaten by
Sister Olive, who presently had no chance against
Furious in the Oaks. Only the occasional nailing
good Derby winners can carry 7st. Gib., or more, to
the front in the Cup race. Tuesday had to reveal
whether Whittier was quite the right nailer, or one
with a distance limit to his brilliancy.
The most impressively excellent performance at
Flemington last Saturday was Violoncello’s in the
Cantala Stakes. Stalled away in the furthest back
corner of the birdcage, Violoncello had been care-
fully shepherded for hours, and was on his best
behavior. The Caulfield Cup gallop, followed by
his winning of the w.f.a. race at Moonee Valley, had
done the big English horse a lot of good, in the
Cantala field he looked in a class by himself. At
Moonee Valley, where Easingwold met Sam Hordern’s
horse on level terms, or thereabouts, the VVestralian
was left with the lead until close home. Then
Violoncello shot out and won decisively. At Flem-
ington the same Easingwold, with 161 b. the better
of the weights, made the pace from a stronger field,
Violoncello lying handy most of the way. This
time he shot out earlier, and his humping of 9st. 71b.
at the head of affairs was a sight for the gods.
Winning by three lengths, whilst Easingwold was
being passed by the Toorak hero (The Tyrant) and
a light-weighted five-year-old, the big chestnut
looked as though he could have carried some of the
gees toiling in the rear. In his Derby Day condition
of body and mind, Violoncello is probably as good as
the best horse in Australia up to 10 or 12 furlongs,
and it was lucky for Harvest King that the other
fellow was sent for the richer stake instead of being
started in the w.f.a. event, which Eurytbmic failed
to annex.
Something of a startler, to conclude the pro-
gramme, was King Ingoda's easy capture of the
Hotham Handicap, where no Cup penalty was in-
volved. Granting that one or two starters were only
out for an airing, and that of two favorites one got
left at the post and the other fell, there was some-
thing to ponder over in the victory of a well-backed
four-year-old who had been let into Melbourne
Cup with 7st. lib. It introduced a new force ifito
the betting, and another powerful rival to the heavy-
weights. Mufti’s third place was very creditable
under the circs., but King Ingoda, after the Hotham
Handicap, was the more moving proposition. Six
months earlier he had been placed fourth in the
Adelaide Cup and Birthday Handicap, carrying about
a stone more than his Melbourne Cup weight. This
easy win indicated an improved King Ingoda, with
probably enough staying power for the two miles.
The books hailed him as a more pleasing candidate
for public faith than Double Bezique would have
been. Also layers who had exceeded their books
against The Cypher were glad to see him losing
ground in the market by another unplaced perform-
ance, albeit that was the colt’s misfortune and not
his fault.
Hotham Handicap form proved a trustworthy
index to the Cup result. The big two-miler was
won by King Ingoda, with The Bulletin's selec-
tions, The Cypher (6st. 101 b.) and Mufti (7st. 9il>.),
in the minor places. King Ingoda is a brown stal-
lion by Comedy King—-Ingoda, was trained by Scobie
and ridden by A. Wilson. Until Saturday he had
never shown the public anything apt to produce
the impression that he had a Cup chance, but after
Saturday he came right into favor, and carried a
ton of money, a large proportion of which came from
South Australia. His starting price was 10’s. The
race was run in heavy going, which suited the
lightweights, and the time was 3min. 28Jsec.

While Cliffdale was running second to
Whittier at Flemington, another of the Shepherd
Kings in King-slot was upholding the family’s repu-
tation in the Queensland Derby. Cliffdale is good,
but Kingslot is probably better. Nothing could have
been easier than the style in which he accounted for
Elpes, the N.S.W. colt Hadley, and half-a-dozon
others, and the time was excellent, 2min. 34 Jsec.
The winner started at 5 to 4 on, and Hadley was
second favorite at 7 to 2. The w.f.a. Spring Stakes
was spoilt by Tolley Scott’s antics at the barrier.
In the end the cranky brute and Glenbern, both
heavily backed, were left, and the 6-to-4 favorite,
Tom McCarthy, won as he liked from the outsider,
Grichka.

After Cupidon’s failure in the Metrop.
lie was taken back home with the idea of capturing
the M.L. Cup. It is recorded that a parcel of money
was put on him last month, but the cable is silent
as to bow he shaped. Scion, a four-year-old Boni-
form neddy, won from the well-performed Foo Chow,
with Muraahi third, the two miles being left behind
in 3min. 27 4-ssec. The imported mare, Glentruin
made a cakewalk of the Stewards’ Handicap, beating
Limelight and The Hawk by lengths, and running
the six furlongs in lmin. 10 2-ssee.

Sutherland’s 84 for Carlton against North
Melbourne was the outstanding effort in Melbourne
district cricket on Saturday. Carlton have now lost
4 for 185, with Love and Sewart 57 and 19 n.o.
Winning the toss, St. Kilda sent in South on a
doubtful wicket, but the Southerners were not a bit
perturbed and finished the day with 6 for 203.
Woodfull (61), Brereton (50) and Park (45) piled
up the runs and took advantage of the seasiders’
poor fielding. Collingwood, requested to bat by
Richmond, knocked off with 9 for 234, Coppock
(49), Pollock (41 n. 0.) and Ryder (37) being
principal scorers. Northcote seem certain of a
first-innings victory over Essendon. The ’Dons totalled
140 (Green 62), and ’Cote are only 18 behind with
five wickets to fall. Hartkopf, of ’Cote, captured
five ’Don . scalps for 72. Le Couteur, 4 for 34 for
Hawthorn-East, was instrumental in dashing the
hopes of Prahran, who failed on an easy wicket for
147. Hawthorn-East are 2 for 16. The Melbourne-
University battle was adjourned on Saturday at a
most interesting stage. Preemantle (4 for 36) and
two or three other students dismissed Melbourne for
126. The scholars, who are 8 for 90, were surprised
by the appearance of Ransford as a bowler. He
skittled Bailey, Freemantie and May, the last two
for an eyeglass each.
A. T. CRESWICK, prominent bloodstock
breeder and racehorse-owner.
The batsmen had a day out in Sydney
grade cricket on Saturday. For Petersham against
Ctlebe R. Wenholz got an excellent 175, which in-
cluded 21 tourers, Petersham losing 8 for 405 —the
highest score of the day. N. Phillips, a right-hander
of promise, collected 142 for Randwick v. North, his
second century for the season; and Eric Bull, of
Mosman, hit 137 against Uni. in hurricane style.
Bull is a powerful Oft. 3in. man who did big things
with the A.I.F. XI. He is just the style of batsman
a public surfeited with steady cricket wants to see.
The only bowling performances out of the rut were
Bert Ironmonger’s 7 for 60 for Balmain v. Western
Suburbs, and Lawrie’s 5 for 63 for Gordon v. St.
George. Ironmonger’s fine performance brought his
season’s figures to 27 for 232, and the selectors
could hardly leave him out of the State team if
he decided to stay in Sydney. But he has sold out of
his suburban pub, and is returning to Victoria. In
addition to the senior matches there was a trial
game between two more or less representative
elevens captained by Collins and Tommy Andrews,
the latter in Macartney’s absence. It wasn’t an
exhilarating affair. Collins’s team went in first and
Warren Bardsley stayed at the wickets all the after-
noon for a rather dreary 184 not out. Hansen
Carter, another veteran, notched 68 not out, and
Alan Kippax helped with a brisk 33, the score
being 7 for 346. C. O’Connor, a small Waverley
man, who bowls slow, high-pitched twirlers, took 3
wickets for 113, and Dr. Campling (Balmain), who
specialises in round-armers, got 2 for 77. Nobody
else did anything of note. Hostilities will be re-
sumed on Saturday afternoon, and Charlie Banner-
man is to get the proceeds. But surely the Cricket
Association can do something more for the fine old
cricketer than this.
“Brad”: Ironmonger is not losing his nomadic
habits. Originally from Queensland, he came to
Victoria, and for one season with the M.C.C. he
seemed the devastating trundler that the selectors
were looking for. But he was not a great success
in inter-State cricket, and, after one or two appear-
ances with the Vic. XI, he \yent to Sydney.
Just as he was qualifying for a place with the Ma
State, he decided to pack his traps for Melbourne
once more, and, it is alleged, will shortly turn
out for St. Hilda. Saints, who were a pretty good
batting side last year, ought to be immensely strength-
ened this time, seeing that the ex-Digger, Lamparci,
late of P’ran, is also included among the seasiders.
* * * *
Except Chapman and Titchmarsh, Mac-
laren’s team didn’t perform brilliantly in their open-
ing match against Westralia. In point of fact, the
Groperlanders made 44 more than the Englishmen’s
first-innings score of 190, but the visitors did
better in their second essay—3 for 132. Their most
noticeable man was A. P. F. Chapman, who scored
75 and 58, and took three catches. He is a graceful
left-hander, and by some critics is considered the
finest in England, though only 22. Titchmarsh got
50 in the second innings, and Wilkinson 40 in the
first. Heindrichs (91 not out) and Evans (53)
were the West’s best. Freeman, the Kent googlie ex-
pert, got 4 for 101, and Gibson, who bowls fast
medium, bagged 4 for 68. Gibson is the same age
as Chapman, both being products of Cambridge.
» * * *
“Tren”: If Australia had to put an eleven
in the field now who could take the places of
Warwick Armstrong and fast bowlers McDonald and
Gregory ? Victorians claim that Dr. Hartkopf, of
Northcote, has a mortgage on Warwick’s place, for
he is a deadly slow bowler, a consistent and fast-
scoring batsman and a splendid field, who always
performs well in inter-State matches. In 1906, when
a college boy of 16, Hartkopf won both the batting
and bowling honors of the Fitzroy senior team, and
last year he performed a similar feat for Northcote.
The only Victorian fast bowler of real ability is
Wallace, of Prahian, and though he has not the
pace of the old champions, his accurate length and
a swing in get him many wickets. Last year, in his
first season of pennant cricket, he won the bowling
average of the premier team with 39 wickets for
13.23, and registered the unique feat of playing
representative cricket in Victoria, N. S. Wales, Tas-
mania, S.A. and W.A. Wallace may bowl from Mc-
Donald’s end, but who can replace Gregory?

Sydney Harbor was a sail-white sheet of
water on Saturday, and those who followed the
yacht races got their money’s worth. The IOJ-mile
contest for the Marshall Plate, under the Royal
Prince Alfred Club’s burgee, was won by Eun-na-
mara, cleverly handled by Rear-commodore Andrew
Wilson, off the 30min. mark. Eun-na-mara, sporting
a new set of drapery, was never headed and romped
home with 3imin. to spare from Rawhiti, piloted
by E. E. Sayer, off scratch, with Sunbeam, I7min.
(A. W. Crane), third, and Scotia, Bona, Magic and
Oenone next in that order. The race for 21ft.
restricted-class yachts was annexed by Kettle, W. E.
Arnott on the bridge, from Gvmea (R. A. Carter),
E.O.J. (J. L. Milson) and the G.-G.'s Corella; and
Tom Golding’s Mascotte, with W. C. Duncan at the
helm, proved too slick for 17 other starters in Sydney
Flying Squadron’s 18ft. chaiupionsmp. Australia,
Britannia and Sydney followed her home. Swastika
looked all over a winner until she dropped her big
spinnaker overboard.
At Bondi (N.S.W.) on Saturday Athol
Coppleson, a splendidly-built 16-vear-old, swam
lOoyds. in 59 l-osee., the fastest hundred ever
clocked in the dead Bondi water. The previous best
time was 60sec., recorded by the late Cecil llealy.
It will be interesting to see how Coppleson shapes
against W. W. Harris, of Hawaii, who is due to
arrive on Jan. 8.
“G. Elburg”: Perth (W.A.) can claim a
youngster, fit to battle with Burns, of King’s School
(B. 12/10/’22). He is E. Hantke, a 16-year-old
wonder, who scooped the pool at tne High School
sports. He entered for seven events, and won them
all, getting over the 100yds. in 10 3-ssec., the 220yds.
in 24 l-ssec., the 440yds. in 58 3-ssec., the 12uyds.
hurdles in 18 l-ssec., the half-mile in 2min. 18sec.
His long jump was 19ft. Bin., his nigh jump
sft. 4-Jin., and had he been pushed he might have
improved his times and distances. At the subse-
quent inter-schools sports the remarkable youngster
won the 100yds., the 220yds., the 440yds., the high
jump and the long jump (21ft. sin.). Ted Hantke,
his father, was the crack athlete of Prince Alfred
College (S.A.) in his day.
“0.K.”: Not long before bis death G. K.
Sims ventured a half-hearted assertion that cocaine
was first brought under the notice of the British
public by one Edward Payson Weston, a Tank who
introduced long-distance walking to London as a
gate-money show. Sims was a trifle uncertain in his
memories of Weston, and his chewing whilst walking.
I could have confirmed his impressions of a conver
sation he had with Weston re the leaf the walker
chewed to keep up his powers of endurance. “To
the best of my recollection it was the coca leaf that
he chewed, and that is the leaf from which cocaine
is extracted,” wrote Sims. Another of his dim
recollections was of an article in the London Daily
Telegraph, dealing with the American’s persistent
use of the coca leaf for his walking stunts, whereby
he earned a lot of money until a lot of resurrected
old peds came along and beat him at his own
game. 1 recollect the coca-leaf story distinctly, and
have often wondered >vhat became of the chewer. I
remember seeing him toiling around the arena with
his jaws slowly working at his vegetable stimulant.
Afterwards I formed the idea that Weston without
his coca leaf would have cut no ice at all as a
pedestrian. #
An unusually game lad is Harry Gordon,
of Melbourne, who got a decision over Billy Tingle,
of Sydney, at the Rushcutter’s Bay Stadium after 44
minutes of stirring boxing, throughout which he got
much the worst of it. In the 15th round, Tingle’s
head bumped against Gordon’s face, and the referee
immediately disqualified him. The bump looked
accidental, and did not mark Gordon or incapaci-
tate him in any way, but Tingle had not been observ-
ing the rules. He had been twice cautioned for
landing low punches. Therefore the referee did the
right thing. Tingle was streets ahead on points,
but Gordon displayed rare pluck, and was always
fighting back hard.
* * * *
The frail-looking and oddly-named Cali-
fornian Spec Ramies (his real patronymic is Whola-
gan, or something like that) threatens to become a
Melbourne favorite. He made things quite interest-
ing for Spargo on Saturday night. For six or seven
rounds he landed on that leathery individual almost
at will. But Spargo is an artist in protecting his
vital points, and as the contest proceeded the visi-
tor’s style of boxing became as familiar to Bert as
his suspender. By the 16th it was a question
of whether Spec would see the thing through. He
did, but he was a gory and groggy object in the
last round. Spargo got the bruiser’s crown anil
Ramies a great cheer for his speed and grit.

“Randolph Rentless”: Old-time middle-
weight boxer “Snowy” Sturgeon now toils with the
Salvation Army. Sturgeon is 53, and physically is
only a shadow of the husky thumper who put up
those great fights with Otto Cribb. But the world
is unkind to the retired pug.

“15.30” : Selecting the world’s best 10 in
tennis, Wallis Myers lines them up in this order:
Tilden, Johnston, Patterson, Richards, Anderson,
Cochet, O’Hara Wood, Williams, Kingscote and
Gobert. Australians can hardly quarrel with the
order of the first seven, though, handing the sixth
place to the French youth Cochet is more a
recognition of potential brilliancy than present form;
but there is room for argument about the other
three. Williams was the UIS. Davis Cup captain,
but took no part in that event, and his play with
Washburn in the American national doubles at
Boston hardly entitled him to the recognition Myers
bestows upon him. Kingscote presumably gets his
place because be put up a plucky fight against
Patterson at Wimbledon, but if he is numbered
among the first 10, just apparently to give Britain
representation, why not have mentioned Randolph
Lycett, incomparably superior to him in doubles,
and so strong as a singles player that he won right
through his half of the draw at Wimbledon, only
failing against Patterson in the final? As regards
Gobert, he played pretty well against the Austra-
lians in the Davis Cup tie in America, but not bet-
ter than the Spanish champion, Alonzo, who
wrenched a match out of the grip of O’Hara Wood
when the Australian was within a couple of points
of a three-set triumph. And what about the Japs
Kumagae and Shimidzu ? Though they did not
appear in the Davis Cup this year, they are always
ranked in the U.S. immediately after Tilden, John-
ston and Richards. I think, that in place of Wil-
liams, Kingscote and Gobert, Myers should have
written Shimidzu (or Kumagae), Alonzo and Lycett.

Les Hammond (N.S.W.) beat 17 other
professional hike-pushers in the 10-mile champion-
ship at Sydney. Jack Atkins made an effort to
win with a lap sprint, but went under by a Wheel
to Hammond in 23min. 6 4-ssee. Jumbo Wells
(M.L.) had the bad luck to puncture. A piquant
item was the struggle between the Dick Muttons
(father and son) in the final of the mile handicap.
They started from the same mark, and the unfilial
youth smothered his poor old dad.
A BITTER WAKENING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“lu Sydney, during the lunch-hour on Saturday,
the police were busy - at the ’phones in the raided
offices of prominent bookmakers, accommodating un-
suspecting - punters with fictitious odds.”
Welshed have I been of old, and Scaled as well.
And many a time on dead ’uns done my dough,
But never had I such a tale to tell
Of heartless, devilish fraud and poignant woe.
It's cruel hard, hard as Ihe hobs of Hell'
How was a cove to know?
Who would have dreamed a cop was at the ’phone
impersonating in a breezy tone
Your favorite Ikey Mo?
Three real good things for Saturday I knew,
On each of ’em I whacked a modest quid.
How I exulted when results came through
And blessed the clever brain beneath my lid,
And barwards sot my course, and with me drew
My cobbers for a tid.
t deemed myself at least a twenty in.
’Struth! Not a blanky deener did I win.
X only thought I did.
A sadder, sicker man when nightfall came,
Homeward I slouched, my head no more erect.
It's ’most enough to make one chuck the game.
Though smiling stoicism I affect
■ file fact remains the Johns have got my name;
There’s nothing to collect;
And now old Six-to-Four-the-Field is treed,
As an accessory before the deed
They’ll pull me, I expect.

YOU, as a farmer, will agree that losses
are prevented and better grade of
grain assured by harvesting at the
right time.
A CASE Kerosene Farm and General Purpose Tractor will
ensure this for you, as it is not affected by heat, and can be
operated day or night when necessary. Furthermore, complete
combustion of the fuel is absolutely ensured in the construction
of the tractor, and no danger need be feared in using the
CASE for harvesting. This also accounts for its economy
of fuel.
The speed of the CASE engine is automatically controlled.
This makes for clean grain in harvesting, and does away with
wear due to excessive speed.
Finally.—The CASE Tractor is no experiment. Everything
the makers claim for it can be proved right on your farm,
and the engineering service back of it, including the supply
of spare parts, is unequalled by any other Tractor concern
in Australia.
The CASE is not only supported by service, but is built to
give service.
Don’t let a “price appeal” lead you to waste money. Buy
the Tractor for SATISFACTION—the
CASE.

Derby Day has always an inexpressibly
cheery air. Collins-street on Saturday morn-
mg was a hilarious welter of motors packed
with cheerful, grinning crowds. Dad was in a
*°j temper, buoyed up by Hope, and Mum
and the girls were allowed liberties in the
matter ot keeping the head of the family
waiting. He is rarely caught in this blissful
mood later in Cup Week. He has either
had a loss and is erochety, or has had a
wm and is mad to get out and lose it again.
llie day started with a cool snap, so
lrocks and enveloping fur-coats were the
order. Then the sun grew warm, and the
owners of fashionable race-coats bitterly re-
gretted having left the garments at home.
Ihe latest race-wrap is like grandmamma’s
c *?™ an > only it is made of such fascinating
stuns that grandma never felt the thrill the
modern woman gets out of her cloak. The
thing crosses over the breast like an old-
tashioned fichu and hangs straight from the
shoulders.
The vice-regal pen was gay. Lady For-
ster was gowned in black charmeuse, must
wonderfully draped and pouched over a
white satin waistcoat, with some gold in
its make up. A long gold chain set with
turquoise and opal hung over the vest. Her
Ex. had with her Mrs. Pitt Livers, Lady
Loughborough, and Mrs. Willie Collins.
Sheila Loughborough shone out in pale-
amber duds. Mrs. Collins was wrapped
m ermine over grey; and a young
daughter, in white cloth; put a red
hat like a waratah into the scene. Lady
Stradbroke hung a loose-fitting coat of
banana-colored cloth on her tall figure, and
achieved a very fine line in her toilette. A
big feathered hat of a soft brown topped
the coat. Lady Helena Rous plumped for
a sensible tailor-made in black and white,
and Mrs. Pitt Rivers came out in neat navy-
blue tailorings. After luncheon there were
numerous other visitors to the vice-regal
stand. Mrs. Phillip Russell, in the smart-
est ot black togs, floated along to say “How-
T he Moulden lady, from Adelaide,
nutted in with a flimsy fawn frock and a
monster brown hat. Mrs. Robert F'ower
showed off an aeroplane hat with side wings
and a very soft black gown. Miss Byron
Moore did her handshake in her favorite
pale grey. Daddy Byron Moore was as
spick and span as usual in the palest of
grey suitings and a brand-new grey bell-
topper.
There was a sensation on the grandstand
when Mrs. Bannon’s dress caught fire from
some careless smoker’s cigarette. The back
of the frock was literally burnt off, and her
husband (ex-Superintendent of Police Ban-
non) roasted his hands badly, and a friendly
woman had her fox furs ruined by banging
at the flames before the conflagration was
put out. The damaged lady was wrapped
m an overcoat and bundled off to a motor-
car.
Tea parties were numerous. Mrs. McCul-
loch entertained a big group, and Mrs.
Herbert Lillies was another hostess. Mrs.
Dan Taylor and her daughters, just back
trom a Colombo trip, had a luncheon-party
and a tea-party under the elms, at which
they entertained crowds of their Melbourne
fronds. Mrs. Edward Miller and Mrs.
Whiting were other popular hostesses. Poor
old Sam Mackay watched the races from his
car, and was disappointed in Yanda’s run-
ning. Mrs. Sam was there to look after him,
and was sweet and smart in a heather coat
over a skirt of large amber and brown plaid.
One_ of the newly-rich, whose georgette
draperies were getting torn, drawled out
tmi time I’ll come in a tailor-made and
I 11 carry one of them hunting sticks to sit on,
They are so swanky.” The cat next to her
grinned, but did not suggest that she meant
a shooting stick.
Mrs. John Chadwick, tailored in fawn
cloth, smiled from under an Oriental bro-
caded toque at her farewell tea-party to
Wilma Berkeley in the Alexandra Club’s
best parlor the other afternoon. Her
daughter Gay stood round in saxe-blue coat
and skirt topped by a brown headpiece.
Little Wilma, who hurried in from Mrs.
Barry Thompson’s big lunch frivol at the
Oriental, brightened the proceedings with
several delightful songs. She dimpled cosily
from the depth of a brown fur coat, a good-
bye token from the generous Fred Knight
pair. The hostess’s sisters, Mrs. George
Selby and Mrs. Armstrong, with the latter’s
chick Nancy, helped to pass the buttered
buns. The Barrett and Fraser dames, the
Albert Miller widow, the Dalrymples, Mrs.
George Kelly and Mrs. William Templeton
were among the social notabilities sighted in
the crowd.
Mrs. Tudor, widow of the Federal Oppo-
sition leader and former Labor Minister
for Customs, has got her discharge from the
Insolvency Court. The obligation to pay
7s. in the £ was dispensed with by Williams,
who is doing the bankruptcy work while
Moule is away. Her lawyer, Eager, ex-
plained that the failure of Meade and Oak-
ley, importers, in which Mrs. Tudor’s
brother (Meade) was a partner, forced her
to tile her schedule. At her brother’s re-
quest she lent £2S(A) to the firm, which was
treated as her share of the capital of the
business, and she also mortgaged her villa
to provide further advances. The share
of her husbands property (£3OOO gross)
left to her was'subject to the condition that
it should not be encumbered by the liabilities
contracted through any partnership or enter-
prise. The discharge application met with
no opposition.
Seemingly the Walkers made no mistake
when they fixed up a “house of festivity’’ for
liire in South Yarra. All sorts and condi-
tion of brief leaseholders come along. The
other night the Southern Cross Assurance
Co. gave a rose-decked dinner and dance at
the house in Darling-street to about 100
shareholders, all of whom went away singing
the praises of the place where tenants come
and go like shadows, and entertainers are
in their own home for the time being.
The handing up of vegetables and things
to the performers in “Boccaccio” at the
Playhouse last Saturday had a little of the
democratic color you never see on purely
professional first nights. So many of the
helpers got a tribute to go on with. Some
of the ballet girleens, if not all of them,
beamed over blossoms that seemed to take
them by surprise. Bouquets for ballet and
chorus girls supply a long-felt want, for
there are first nights at some of the strictly
commercial theatres (the Playhouse is more
repertory than commercial) when all the
vegetables ought to go to non-principals, and
the folks with the most to say should be
denied roses and wine altogether. It \yas
just jolly to see something like a reasonable
distribution of compliments among the “Boc-
caccio” crowd, although pictures of disap-
pointment and congealed envy could be
detected in the gathering. The ordeal of
waiting to be comforted by a floral offering
must be awful, if one has long to wait.
Everybody’s looking at your neglected condi-
tion.
After much solemn debate the jazz-weary
public-school captains and prefects have col-
lectively recommended a close season for
flapper whirls during the last school term—
a decision which will not exactly cut flap-
perdom to the quick, as the elders usually
absorb the final three months with their own
orgies. Anyway, the young things can make
a welter of the first nine months of the
year, when, according to prefect logic, in-
terruptions to learning don’t much matter.
This photo, all the way from Bananaland,
shows you Mrs. M. Forrest, whose “Streets
and Garden s,” a
dainty little bro-
chure of verse, has
just come hot from
the press. She is a
native of the Dar-
ling Downs (Q.),
and cleaves to the
northern State; and
persistently con-
founds those who
talk of the enervat-
ing climate up there
by maintaining her
reputation as the
most industrious ver-
sifier in the Com-
monwealth. Her
work is a frequent
occurrence in vari-
ous papers through-
out Australasia, and
her market extends as far afield as America
and England. There is a human feeling
and sense of color in her poems that give
them a wide appeal, and with the women
of Australia—particularly those out back—
she has long been a prime favorite.
Ballarat West’s members have not grown
rich on the game. Lawyer Baird, Chief
Secretary, _ is about the most fortunate of
the last 25' years. Ivirton i§ secretary ~of !
Master Bakers’ Association with a salary
not quite so large at a State M.P.; Dicky
Vale’s last days were cheered by a £3 or
£3 10s. a week job in the Mines Museum,
with his Executive Councillor’s pass to take
him home at the week-ends; Shoppee, the
chief advocate of Ballarat as the Federal
capital, who got into the Assembly as a
Kyabfamapootra, and was once a prosperous
merchant, eked out his last years as super-
intendent__of a local charitable institution ;
and McKissock (now under the sod) and
Scott Bennett, who each had a look in for
a few sessions, certainly made nothing, out
of politics.
Lieut.-Col. Sigismund Schlamm, who
used to be a Melb. Block figure in days gone
by, has drifted back after much S’Afrman
experience. He was wdh Botha -when- the
latter mopped up Fritz in South-West
Africa, and when that job was through he
got away to Britain and put in the rest of
the war in a home-service job.
There is still talk at City Council meet-
ings and outside of shifting our Town Hall;
but it can hardly be taken seriously. The
corporation will stick to its precious corner.
It owns the coffee-palace site next door, and
could get the Athenaeum Building adjoining
if right tactics were adopted. FTinstance,
the Council could contract to supply for all
time reading rooms for the library of the
Athenaeum, and a top-storey hall for art
exhibitions and lectures. The sale of the
hall site would be a fine endowment for
members.
This is a photo of George Keat, a Maori-
lander, who adopted Australia as his home,
and now proposes
literally to fly back
to the shaky land
of his birth. He
went away to the
war as a private,
joined the R.F.C.
and won a captaincy
before the finish.
When the dove of
peace began to
coo he went to
London, whence he
is now returning
with the ’bus in
which he hopes to
win fame. The
Keat family, origi-
na 11 y of Christ-
church (M.L •), is
getting known here.
A brother, Clifton
Keat, is a tenqr who is blossoming to some
purpose from the Melbourne ’Varsity Con.
The Russell Grimwade pair got in early
with their congratulatory fox-trotting party
for Gwenda Grimwade, who has just
engaged herself to Chester (“Chettie”) Mani-
fold. The bridegroom-elect was unable to
share the honors, as he is mourning his squat-
ter dad. The Grimwades’ Toorak shack
was smothered in roses for the glad happen-
ing. The hostess was in pink satin drip-
ping with crystal beads at the upper end,
and her niece’s comely fairness was
heightened by tender green draperies girdled
with green and purple grapes. A wreath
of the same seductive fruit struck a fine
bacchanalian note on her golden head. The
scene changed from a dance to a carnival for
the supper act, when toy hooters, drums and
other childish noise-makers were uproariously
unloaded from giant green crackers depend-
ing from a tangle of green ribbons overhead,
and the crowd dealt out stoush to itself
with gold bladders, amid a fire of cotton-
wool snowballs. Picture the pained atti-
tude of the modern flapper if anyone asked
her to introduce such a schoolroom romp into
her two-stepping parties! The bride-
elect got a white cracker wreathed with
orange blossom, and, much to the horror of
the superstitiously-inclined, she also got a
white floral trophy. Among the revellers
were Lord and Lady Digby, the Pitt
Riverses and gent.-helps Lawrence and
Palmer. >
When this wretched page announced the
marriage of Tom Hogan’s beautiful young
widow to Norman Ducker, of Sydney, it
stated the place of sacrifice as St. Paul’s,
Melbourne. The cathedral should have been
St. Pat.’s, of course. The blame must be
apportioned in about equal parts between
the comp and the handwriting of the lady
who wrote the par.
The three Mackies who have given £lO,OOO
for houses at Scotch College’s new site, Glen-
ferrie, Vic., are beneficiaries under the will
of Captain McMeckan, and the . houses will
be a memorial to the old mariner. The Mc-
Meckan will case made a great picking for
the lawyers 30-odd years ago, but Grace
Mackie, one of the three donors to the col-
lege, came out of it with flying colors.
The lift being on strike on Monday night
Austral Salon enthusiasts braved the ascent
of the lengthy stairway to view “The Mar-
riage of Nitty.” Mrs. Maurice Dudley, as
the fluffy little intriguer Kitty, cloaked a
Lady Macbethian personality with the clever
mimicry of a Maiie Tempest, but was too
heavily handicapped by type to get home in
the part. A mid-Victorian waist and chiffon
effects did net mend matters. Saving his
wider outline; Leo Burke might have passed
for Graham Browne as the fickle hubby. The
other males,’ Arthur Pay, H. M. Hill and
■Charles TJfygon, mummed creditably. Ruby
May side-tracked the broken accent in her
highly-colored edition of the foreign widdy
vamp. Miss Dulcie Joseph lifted a well-
poised soprano between the acts with the
assistance of Natalie Dawson at the piano.
A remarkable story of juvenile dare-
devilry, or blank unsusceptibility to danger,
comes from Bendigo. Two boys, aged 11
and 0, had been having a great time with
fuse and- detonators, of which they seemed
to have an inexhaustible supply. At last
asL/ C te lm^ ter got to hear of ‘it, and
m£ ey came b .y such dangerous
l he youngsters admitted having
taken them from the underground working's
° Jacent m ine, and startled the master
with the statement that they and their sister
aged b, had gone down the shaft to GODft’
by the ladder-way. The actual climbing
would not be very formidable for a bov
had the nerve to tackle it; but that
a little girl of six years could do it is
amazing.
Dolly Castles, who is Mrs. Finn these
days, will take part in the amateur matinee
production at Her Majesty’s on the 18th
~ Mrs. Harold Clapp’s musical playlet in
aid ot the Free Kindergarten Union. The
name of the thing is “Lucille of Bond-
ftreet and has been successfully tried on
the American dog, it seems. It comes
rather appositely, by the way, inasmuch
as the original “Lucille” of that particular
part of London (Lady Duff Gordon) has
just gone bankrupt. The authoress is in
the cast with other smart matrons, and Fred
Newman, for one, will stand for valuable
amateur experience on the male side of the
social forces. On the same bill Mrs. Apper-
ley and the Mermaid Co. will appear m a
one-act comedy.
A budget from Adelaide:—
Helene Taylor, back from a hectic 10 days in Mel-
bourne, was guest of honor at the Town Hall the
other afternoon, with the feminine element of her
Equipment Fund Committee as hostesses. She, of
course, was the star performer of a programme in
which Doreen Stoneman, lidyth Lucas and Ada
McCarthy also figured, and the 400-odd present waxed
enthusiastic concerning her. Helene flits London-
wards at the end of the month with the Gerald
Vplenns.
Mrs. Mayfield, President of the Women’s Branches
i : the Liberal Union, is due in the Orvieto after a
strenuous holiday that has been mostly occupied with
seeing how women conduct their political and social
affairs in the Cold Country. Her daughter is with
her; and the H. P. MacLachlans are passengers on
the same boat.
The much younger set, or the section of it that
dances, has had it all its own way this week, with
demonstrations by Wanda Edwards’s and Nora Stew-
art’s pupils. The first show was at the Victoria
Hall, for the School for Mothers and the Soldiers’
Immediate Relief Fund, and the takings were swelled
by flower and sweet stalls under the wings of the
mothers of some of the dancers. Miss Stewart’s
pupils then betook themselves to the Theatre Royal,
and filled the house with a clamorous audience. Solo
dancing honors lay with Dorothy Slane, but Thom
Gordon Short, Nancy and Joan Atkins, Betty Puddy,
Patty Connolly and Shirley Stevens ran her fairly
close. The rising generation of Milnes, Burstons,
Duncans, Smeatons, Bakewells, Murrays, Hacks,
Gosses, Hacketts, Bonythons, Cudmores and Hawkers
were among the performers, and at the end of the
show the stage disappeared under a barrage of
flowers and chocolates.
The Jervis Bay’s passengers included Dr. Bicker-
steth and his wife (he is Canon of Canterbury Cathe-
dral), on a visit to their son at St. Peter’s College.
It also brought, from some of the passengers, the
usual complaints concerning food, etc., that seem to
be inseparable from voyages in the Hughes ships.
The Colin Duncans took the long way round from
Sydney to Melbourne for the Cup, and put in four
or five days with his people here on the way. Other
South Australians who have departed for the revel
are the Tom Barr Smiths, the J. H. Gosses and the
Frank Mouldens.
From England comes news of the death of E.
Burney Young, son of the late C. B. Young, of
Adelaide, and brother of the vigneron and M.P. of
that ilk. He was first manager of the Government’s
wine and produce depot in London, and established it
upon foundations that were responsible for a good
deal of its subsequent success. Latterly he had been
farming in Sussex, and was planning to sell out and
come back to S. Aus. when he died.
Henry Howard, who has banged the pulpit of the
Pirie-street Church, Adelaide, for about 17 years, the
other day visited Oxford to see two sons bagging
degrees on the same day. Arthur, who was learning
music in Germany when the guns began to shoot, and
was interned, was made a Master of Arts; and Stan-
ford, one of the youngest fliers who worried Fritz,
became a Bachelor of Arts.
The passing of October sees the passing of Miss
Boothby and her sister from the May Club, founded
by them long since as the pioneer women’s club of
this village, and since then the focal point of half
our feminine interests. They have voted themselves
a holiday, and are handing over the management to
Miss Randall. Meanwhile they’ve had farewell
parties from the club’s Reading Circle and the gen-
eral dub members, at each of which tangible evidence
of the affection in which they are held was handed
them —a purse at one and a wallet at the other.
The Travellers’ Aid Society gave itself a gift tea
the other afternoon, whereby it amassed a good
many new possessions, though linen and towels are
still badly needed. Since the move was made to the
big house on North-terrace none of the 31 beds has
been long empty, and in nine cases out of ten emer-
gency on one part, and much contriving on the
other, has swollen its accommodation to 40 or so.
Musical Adelaide is mourning the death of Erica
Chaplin—the young violinist whose talents won her
the Elder Scholarship four years ago, but she was even
then too ill to make use of it and seize the chance
of London training and experience. She had four
other scholarships to her credit, as well as four or
five gold medals, and she invariably left other com-
petitors far behind in any competitions for which she
entered.

For Christmas
—a Phonograph
—you could not discover a gift more peculiarly
fitting the occasion and the perpetuation of
family kinship. How different from the
innumerable small and useless presents is the
Gift Supreme, the gift that brings MUSIC.
For Music is the world’s greatest tonic for
mind and spirit; it raises the culture of a home
and makes for true refinement.
But the music you admit to your home must
be real music; therefore you should ask this
question first: “This phonograph I am buying,
has it absolute realism? Has it ever been
tested in direct comparison with the actual
artist or musician?’’ Then you will find that
ONLY ONE PHONOGRAPH has true realism
—for only one has dared such a test —and
that one is “The New Edison.’’
OS* NEW
EDISON
“The Phonograph with a Sou/.'*
Talking machines imitate, but Edison’s miracle
actually Re-Creates voice and music so perfectly
that no human ear can distinguish between the
artist and instrument.
Won’t you hear this wonderful instrument?
Won’t you satisfy yourself that the strongest
claims cannot exaggerate its merit? Write to-day
and we’ll show you what Music’s Re-Creation really
means.

State Government House burst into a
garden-party for the delectation of the pro-
vincial pressmen and their womenfolk on
Thursday, and the visitors, many of whom
hail from the top oven-shelf of Queensland,
and ’way back o’ Bourke, were smiled upon
by an afternoon that was all golden sun-
light and murmurous winds rustling sleep-
ily over green lawns and blue water. A
sun-baked lean-jawed crowd, most of these
men, with here and there an occasional
straggling-moustached backblocker, such as
appears in a Reason picture. They had their
own jokes at the city’s expense, too, and
the biggest laughs chortled round Mr. Le
Souef’s suggestion that the A.P.P.A. might
occasionally supply Taronga with a little
native fauna. “Guess the cub reporter might
take a day off now and then to run in a
’roo or a wallaby!” drawled a man from
the Tweed; while the man from Dungog
reckoned what the Zoo really needed was an
untamed specimen of the A.P.P. Sir Walter
was in great form, and so was Dame Mar-
garet, who appeared in sand-colored silk
finished by a floating mauvey-blue feather
placed athwart a flat hat. Miss Henderson
was her chief support, and Premier Fuller’s
lady and daughter her constant companions.
Gwen Fuller, in white embroidered voile,
floating side panels and a large white muslin
hat, was one of the belles of the party,
though the countrymen’s daughters more
than held their own. Here and there rosy
cheeks as smooth and fine as cherry-skin
spoke of a home in the clear cold air of the
mountains or the higher plains. Lister, of
the Moreton Bay Mail, wore a grey felt
wide-awake spreading of brim, but ope or
two misguided townies sported tall hats, and
a few even went the whole hog and wore
cutaway coats. Farmer Whyte, of the Tele-
graph, arrived when the last ice had dis-
appeared, and secretary Shakspeare was
humping his presentation-plate towards the
outer gates.
Queensland Premier Theodore and his
black-haired wife passed through Sydney last
week on their way to the Cup. He’s a
striking figure, this northern politician of
Roumanian descent, with ‘ his large regular
features, his unruffled brow and strong
physique. The two dispensed a good deal
of quiet hospitality while waiting to know
if they would really sail southwards by the
Ormonde, or have to wangle last-minute
berths on the train.
Winsome Huggins, one of Sydney’s
younger set, was lassoed with a wedding-
ring last week at Scots’ Church (and you
couldn’t expect a different fate for a pretty
girl with a name like that!). The bride-
groom was Boyd Ilolderson, of Melbourne,
and leading parts were played by Cathie
Scott Fell and Barbara Brooks, who pre-
sented an attractive bridesmaid act in pale
mauve and silver, tissue. The bride’s attire
was of ivory satin with a full complement
of georgette, tulle and crystal accessories.
The Australia spread the wedding meats.
A well-filled Town Hall listened to the
pot pourri of grand opera poured out by
the Choral Society on Saturday night. The
principal vocal parts were taken by Maude
Telfer, Winslow Knight and Frank Charl-
ton, Ernest Truman fluctuated between the
organ and the grand piano, and Henry
Perin put the final Marcel to the coiffure
of a Debussy Concerto. John Lemmone
fluted as gently as Theocritus of old, and
the Choral Society, in two shades of laven-
der sashes, gave robust support in the opera-
tic and oratorio numbers. Winifred Carter
was at the harp, and conductor William
Asprey guided the joyous noises.
The Governor Davidson couple, with
Daphne and Diana and Miss Henderson,
shed vice-regal effulgence on the fair at the
Ryde Home for Incurables on Saturday
afternoon. This annual gathering marks
the day of days for the ailing inmates; and
the stalls stocked with the fine needlework
from the often-twisted and always fragile
hands is a thing to call for admiring won-
der. Even for this great event there are
always some of the patients too sick to be
wheeled into the grounds, but their wards
are turned into something very close to a
garden by Fred Searl, who is treasurer of
the Home. One ward the other day was
massed in shaded carnations, and another
was banked with green pot-plants, and trel-
lished with rambler roses. Mrs. Floyd and
Gwenda Monie, who ran a “Notions” stall
and dip, were among the most plutocratic
of the day’s traders; but the happiest of
all (if organiser Maggie Thwaites is ex-
cepted) was the old lady with the once-
slender hands now gnarled with rheumatism
who always runs the stall in the porch. On
his way out, Sir Walter made her a special
call, gave her a crinkly pound-note for her
stall, and brought her a fairing of a. bottle
of perfume for herself. Hugh Dixon was
another of the benefactors present—his
donation to the new cancer wing is princely.
And, of course, Miss Margaret Harris’s
bonnet, black lace mantle and carriage and
pair were features of the afternoon.
Last week Sydney was treated to a faint
flavor of Russian revolutionary romance by
the arrival of General lonoff, who is on
his way to settle in Maoriland. When the
Czar’s throne crashed lonoff joined up with
the White Army, but his family was impri-
soned by the Bolshevists in Turkestan. Sub-
sequently the Chinese Government inter-
vened on his behalf —-he had got out to China
—and the family was released. At the
time of the revolution the General had
buried his valuables and jewels; and he was
lucky enough to be able to re-secure these,
so he has a coin or two to rattle in his
pockets, and is much better off than most
once-wealthy Russian refugees now scatter-
ing over the world.
Chief Justice Cullen is to be a front-
seater at the Salon performance of Gilbert
and Sullivan’s “Trial by Jury” on the 15th.
The stage furniture has been the stiffest
hurdle the secretary, Mrs. Milner Stephen,
has had to face —the only set is in possession
of the Firm, and it is at the moment gaily
touring the East.
St. James’s put out white favors and a red
carpet on Saturday afternoon, when Frank
Bethune’s girl, Molly, became the wife of
Noel Tregarthen, grandson of the judicial
knight William Manning, but most gener-
ally referred to as “Joan Tregartlien’s
brother.” She was arrayed in the time-
honored bridal trappings to the last parti-
cular ; and her young man and his sup-
porter, Bruce Darling, were equally con-
ventional sartorially speaking. One brides-
maid and two tin> trainbearers in daffodil-
hued froeking completed the wedding-group.
The toasts were drunk at the Bethune home
in Woollahra.
David McKee Wright is striding into the
limelight as a horticulturist. Out of his
second edition of the Garden of Eden at
Glenbrook he descended on Penrith the
other day, and practically swept the show
board. Roses and pansies were his long-
suit, and. he bagged the championship of
the exhibition with a Mrs. Herbert Stevens
bloom —a wonderfully beautiful white rose.
Poet Rod. Quinn’s mail brought him a
pretty compliment the other day—a letter
written by the girls’ sixth class of the Dar-
linghurst Superior Public School, asking him
for his photograph to hang on the class-room
wall. They called him “One of the Austra-
lian writers whose poetry they loved and
admired.” Of course Rod., not being a
matinge idol, hadn’t a photograph by him,
but, a woman friend who saw the letter
hustled him into ordering a special one for
the kiddies, and the photograph was hung
the other afternoon by teacher Miss Fraser
in an awed silence beside a picture of David
McKee Wright.
The Teddy Moates couple—he’s a stalwart
member of the firm of Noyes Brothers —are
expected back in Sydney on Christmas eve.
Jersey, from which taxless island the lady
comes, is to be their last place of call.
This is the writer of “Miss Futter’s Aus-
tralian Home Cookery.” She is one of
the daughters o f
John Futter, of Kil-
licarara, Miirrum-
hurrah, whose
people were among
the first batch of
Australian pioneers.
The art of cooking
has always been a
matter of particular
interest to this
family, so much so
that during Miss
Futter’s early tra-
vels she spent a
good deal of her
time collecting Con-
tinental and English
recipes, and in in-
quiring into the
kitchen arrange-
ments of the coun-
tries she was visiting. Melba has written
a preface to her old friend’s literary venture,
in which she says, “The recipes range from
the tried and trusty dishes of the old spaci-
ous pioneer days to the most modern of
dishes.” May Moore took the photo.
To keep the Sydney Soldiers’ Club off
the rocks, its guardian angel, Dr. Mary Booth,
has dragged a promise from Prime Minister
Hughes that the Commonwealth will grant
£ for £ up to £lOOO for its upkeep; hence
the Club is launching an appeal which will
enable the Commonwealth bounty rto be
tapped. This is the last survivor of those
places which gave returned soldiers cheap
meals and beds; and some of the men still
need such help badly.
A very human touch, at the Coroner’s in-
quest into the Moore Park horror, was the
statement of one witness who, questioned
about his occupation, said that he was a
clerk, but had been a policeman. He had
taken the new work because his wife didn’t
like him being a constable. “But,” he
added, “I’m going to rejoin the police again.”
A public announcement of the fact that his
matrimonial story had moved on to that stage
when the habits that were sworn off for her
sweet sake are renewed, and the pledges that
she exacted lose their binding spell.
Ethel Hely, the capable Bananalander
who has come to Sydney to help organise
the flood of social activities to be loosed on
our city and suburbs in aid of the Royal
Hospital for Women, is a grand-niece of
Captain Gother K. Mann, whose robin-
redbreast military regalia is one of the most
vivid masses of color in the Historical
Society’s Show. The gentleman’s descend-
ants live near Gosford, on the grant of land
chosen by him in preference to the block on
what is now George-street.
This is Thomas Allwright Dibbs, who
celebrated his 90th birthday a few days ago
and is still going
extremely strong. He
married one of the
Gadens, 65 years
ago, when he was
still a very junior
official of the Com-
mercial Banking Co.
—an institution of
which, 10 years
later, he was to be-
come general man-
age r—and had a
large family. He
handed over Gray-
thwaite, his beautiful
North Shore home,
to the Red Cross
during the World
War, in which, inci-
dentally, he lost
some of his best-
loved relatives. George (“Dam’ Chicago”)
Dibbs, sometime Premier of N. S. Wales,
was one of the few trials of the old gentle-
man’s prosperous and honorable career.
George was a Republican; Thomas, a
vehement King’s man and Conservative;
and it is hardly necessary to remark that
these political elements refused absolutely
to blend.
Mary Yeo, of Yass, who put in most of her
Sydney holiday helping at the Historical
Society’s Exhibition, is one of the few who
combine all the modern young woman’s
energy for civic and social welfare with an
affection and admiration for those days of
old when woman mostly adorned the buttery
and the spinning-wheel, or, like Goldilocks
in the nursery rhyme, “sat on a cushion and
sewed a fine seam.” Mary brought a col-
lection of her district’s treasures down to
the show, and, what’s more, could tell you
the history, root and branch, of every family
represented. When not busy with her J.P.
duties, she occasionally lets her pen loose
on Bulletin pars.
Violet, the pretty Titian-haired elder
daughter of Mrs. E. Dupre, of Elizabeth
Bay, has just engaged herself to Cecil Mon-
tague Williams, of Chatsworth station,
Binda, near Crookw’ell. youngest son of the
late Thomas David Williams and Mrs. Wil-
liams, of Yanco. Since the bride-elect left
school she has been learning to make hand-
wrought jewellery at the studio of Rhoda
Wager, whose work Governor Davidson was
so taken with at the recent x\rts and Crafts
exhibition.
Archbishop Kelly’s golden jubilee as a priest
was studded with heartening Papal cables, and
illuminated addresses from the R.C. child-
ren and clergy. The Pontifical High Mass
at St. Mary’s on the great day bristled with
bishops’ mitres and Papal decorations, and
Mayor McElhone graced it in all the panoplied
glory of the civic rabbit-skin. After the
mass about 140 prominent R.C.’s and the
clergy betook themselves to the jazz-room
of the Australia, where they lunched in
ewcclsis on refreshments brought de pro-
fundis, and sandwiched eulogies of the Arch-
bishop in between libations. They didn’t
arrive at the “Auld Lang Syne” stage till
4 in the afternoon. Bishop Redwood, from
Maoriland, a mere stripling of 85, made
the speech of the day in a voice as mellow
and strong as that of Oscar Asche. Bishop
White, another Maorilander, but from away
down south, sweltered politely through the
long service; while Dr. Mannix, from Mel-
bourne was, like that charming Cresar’s wife,
“all things to all men.” The little snack
cost the knights of the church anything from
two to five guineas—for the fiver you
brought a friend and hobnobbed with the
Purple; for the two guineas you had just
as good a time somewhere below the salt.
But in this age of the Feminist Movement,
w r hen_an organised woman’s vote could make
or unmake Prime Ministers, not a woman
was asked to the meal, nor even thrown the
bone of a reception afterwards. You see,
lovely woman has no finger in the Papal
oaiiot, so bishops are about the only poten-
tates who can afford not to have themselves
tied to a woman’s apron-strings.
Padre Alan Whitehorn, of St. Alban’s,
Darlington, and Moore Theological Col-
lege, drops a line from Banff mostly descrip-
tive of several branches of a children’s court
be visited m Canada. The Rotary Club in
fed him, and the young enthusiast
told the Judges, lawyers, bishops and “repre-
sentative citizens” who sat round the board
all about the vvorking of the kiddies’ court
jo Sydney. His ultimate goal is Denver,
Colorado, where Judge Ben Lindsay special-
ises in the re-making of little larrikins. The
remarks of this famous American should be
worth hearing, after the discussion now rag-
ing as to the futility of the system in Aus-
tralia.
Sydney has a round-about interest in the
International Conference arranged to meet
at Berlin with a view to stiffening the
physique of the mark. Of the four experts
invited to empty the contents of their brain-
cells into ballast for the featherweight cur-
rency, one is Professor Jenks, of the New
York University, whose son is head of the
Sydney branch of the Alexander Hamilton
Institute, and whose 12-months-old grandchild
is Australian-born.
Dorothy Helmrich is still going ahead in
London. The Mosman girl is warbling
regularly, and lately sang four nights at the
Bournemouth Winter Garden. But she
says, “Someone should warn Australian musi-
cal students that things are in a bad way
here. There is_ very little doing. As an
instance, 30 artists who appeared at last
season’s Promenades were this season struck
off the lists.” The Coads (she was Marjory
Beeby) left for New York in July, and have
since settled within coo-ee of Broadway.
Philip Wilson was holidaying in Hunland
when the mail left. Dorothy and Anne
McKenzie are now installed in a cosy flat
in London. Anne, who is a piano student,
is a daughter of one of Sydney’s timber
kings. Dr. Norman Zions (now Dr. Nor-
man Haire), who figured in Sydney amateur
theatricals some years ago, has become that
figure of romance, a Harley-street physician,
and is attracting attention by making start-
ling remarks about birth-control.
The unmarried trio of Langtree sisters
is soon to be reduced by . one. Colonel
Norman Miles, of the Permanent Military
Staff, has secured Marjorie’s promise to be
his for life. The three sisters are among
Sydney’s best-dressed young women, and
what is more, they design and make all the
frocks and most of the hats they wear. The
lucky wooer, who left Sydney as a captain
in the early stages of the war, has a fine
fighting record.
A Brisbane postscript
Despite the dog days his Ex. has given a round
of' dinner- and tennis-parties (at several of
which Walter Kirby was numbered among the
guests), smiled upon the fete arranged by the Sisters
of Mercy in All Hallows green grounds, and applauded
the Barbara Sisley Players when they did “Sweet
Nancy” for the Alexandra Home. Peter Macgregor’s
chick, by the way, played Nancy, and her aunt was
the handsome Newton girl who took to the footlights
for a brief spin and subsequently married Langloh
Want, of Sydney. Joan and Margaret, daughters of
medico Robertson, saw the show with Sir Matthew.
Boyd Cullen hosted" a dinner at Lennon’s to Jean
Cullen and Rex Crane, amid larkspurs, carnations
and meadow-sweet, and on Nov. 2 parson Merrington,
D-D., successfully yoked them together in St.
Andrew’s Kirk. Jean is the younger daughter of
“Harbors” Cullen and Mrs. E. A. Cullen, of Hamil-
ton, and Rex hails from the Apple Isle. Arum-lilies
in brass decorated the kirk and ivory morocain with
silver ribbons, the bride. The latter also sported a
true-lovers’ knot veil, lent by Mrs. John Cameron. The
three bridesmaids were in yellow satin with georgette
overdresses and hats of gold and black lace with
roses red. Being a night-wedding the grounds of
“The Haven,” where the bride’s mother received in
grey brocade tipped by a black hat and a bunch of
pink roses, were lit with much electricity. The
bridegroom’s mother favored maize and a black hat
with a pink posy. To the confounding of Pussyfoot’s
allies, a silver canteen was flung into the gift-pool
by the bridegroom’s cheerful relatives. The bride
started out for the honeymoon in the Cairns district
in navy, with touches of deep red.
Several mysterious Hallowe’en rites took place in
the select atmosphere of the Lyceum Club on Octo-
ber 31, though no one was actually burned at the
stake. Red-shaped lamps lit up the C.T.A. function.
J. E. England’s baritone was heard among the
singers, and the feminine warblers had many
flowers and sweets cast up at them.
Visitors from leisurely Melbourne should go warily
in busy Brisbane nowadays. Brooke Nicholls, the
Melbourne dentist, was bumped by a motor-car an
hour or two after his arrival by the Cooma en route
for the North. Wilton Love doctored his damaged
leg at his own house, and got him fit to go on with
his party to the tropics by Guy Fawkes Day.
There died at New Farm, the other day, Mrs. J.
G. Fowler, whose husband once edited the Inde-
pendent and Beacon at Cooktown, and is now a
Papuan magistrate. Mrs. Fowler, who spent over
23 years in Papua, where she was highly popular,
leaves two daughters to mourn her passing.

It only

Ten
Minutes’
to prove the Superiority
in Tone and Touch
of the
GULBRANSEN
PLAYER PIANO
as evidenced by the wonderful enthusiasm
shown by owners of this remarkable
instrument.
The Gulbransen Duo-Concerto provides a com-
plete control over the stroke of the piano
hammer, and that is why this remarkable
player can, and does, really produce perfect
tone color, and in the hands of anyone, after
a little practice, rivals the musical performances
of the highest class of virtuosi.
Whether the piano is played by hand or by the
foot-pedals, perfection of tonal values is the
aim of every performer.
If through sentiment or for some other reason
you would not care to part with your own
piano, we will convert it into a Duo Concerto
Player Piano, containing all the latest
improvements.
We have just installed in our new factory
one of the latest 88-note music-roll cutting
machines in the world.
As we are desirous of supplying you with
our latest monthly bulletin of new rolls, we

Big Bend: That prayer yarn was fastened
oil to an American negro a couple of generations
back....W.W. (W.A.) : Ant battle too lengthy....
L.K.U.: None of the 10 quite up to the mark...,
B. : The yarn gets tired just when something
might have been made of it... .F.W. (Chatswood) :
Hasn’t a fresh note.. . .R.F.S.: The waters are too
dead.... Francis N.: The same yarn has been told
too often before; and you hardly even vary it... .
Cape Weed: Not enough in it... .Non-nomme:
Nothing there.... Plodder: Sorry, but “Leone” is too
thin.... Amy H.: So far they are only imitative
commonplaces... .N.F.S.: The “Trunk Mystery”
doesn’t strike us... .G.O’S : Dull yarn about nothing
in particular.... F.W. (Sandgate) : Heavy and obvi-
ous stuff A.E.S.: No use for your river that
flows on to show the grace of its “Architect’s hand.”
... .W.M.D.: Doesn’t exactly thrill us.... Oliver B.;
You are never so fine as when dealing with the
hardy pioneers who made the bullock-tracks: —
Hah! Hah! by crumbs a. a you wouldn’t believe it,
The hall, the hall just splitting its sides.
When wiry told about his profit,
And making harness, and chains out of hides.
Then, then the toast was drank;
With glasses filled to the brim,
I can tell you there wasn’t a blank,
As they rose clink, clink in praise of him.
®So it went on ’til one and two,
These grand old pioneers;
Telling how and what they had to do;
Little they had then to spend in beers.
Ah! as you see it now a, a what,
To meet these old battlers again ;
Years and years, struggled on without a pot,
Their one wish was to meet again, and again.
So ended this gathering of muscle of steel,
Old Wiry finished by dancing a reel ;
Glasses filled, clink, clink, the last to deal;
God save the King.
The pioneers are just the thing.
. ...8.G.R.: About as sparkling as a boiled cabbage.
... .Murdlanti: No interest... .A.McN.: Far from
print. .. .Cecil If.: Not up. . . .Unibar: Very feeble.. .
Cowboy: What’s it all about ?... . Lena L.: Doesn’t
get near. .. . N.B. (Solomon Islands): Poor verse.
~... Victor S.: One of the prime essentials of
publishable verse is that it should be about some-
thing.... 89588: Doesn’t move us.... Norman C.:
One stanza grips:—
No thought of rest within the bowels
Of that great tree whose very might,
Should keep her safe from hungry owls,
And other raiders of the night,
.Z.V.W.: Those poppies have been worked over
and over again by everybody who can handle a pen,
....Ruby D.: More poppies, but, thank the Muse
of album verse, you leave out the graves in Flanders.
. ...D.W.S.: Very rugged.... R.G. H.: Wanted more
delicate handling.... Tardy Match: Doesn’t make a
yarn. .. .F.E.P.: Not up by some distance,...
A.S.IL: People who use shorthand contractions in
presenting a literary manuscript ought to be warned
off all newspaper courses. They are never triers. ~.
A.W.D.: The yarn has an evil odor, and it fails to
convince.... Wally: Very lumpy verse J.R.M, 1
The idea is better than the handling, .Judith C,!
A small thing dragged out to inordinate length....
H.C. (Leichhardt) : Request to settle an involved
theological controversy at a hand gallop doesn’t
appeal.... Thorold W.: No mirth in it.... Michael
F.: The metre runs away with the “Explana-
tion.”.... R.C. (Lindfield): The sonnet fails....
F.B. J.: Not badly done; but the yarn is nearly as
old as Creation... .H.R.L.: The sonnet won’t
do King K.: “The Resurrection” sounds
false... .R.L.D.: Very rugged and imitative.
. ...D.F.P.: Sorry, but it doesn’t strike
u 5.... Cross Nibs: It rambles too much....
Bay W.: No g00d... .P.8.P.: A great improvement.
. ...Tom Hah: Terrible verse... .8.C.P.: Too slight.
H.S.S.: All the old cliches J.E.C.: “The
beauties of the South Coast are proverbial with all
lovers of nature.” Have you ever seen a sketch that
starts like that in this paper?... .T.K.: Well, here’s
a bit of the “following poerty”:—
T sat one Christmas eve upon a bank
To watch the stream decend
But the mad waters rushing o’er
Reeds so rank brought back to
Me the day she met her end.
Brought back to me the days of
Sorrow grief and pride them days 1
Can’t forget but all the world lies
Gloomy before ine but still yet
The mountain rocks lies glooming the timbered
Hills shines fare athort it comes thrilling threw
Me and I think it is her shining hair.
....Bernard F.; “Weeroona” is the well-known
pen-name of a first-rate Australian writer, and may
not be stolen by any other. Your yarn has points,
but the exaggeration spoils it....E.H. (Turra-
murra): Don’t like it.... Bellerive: It has the
authentic Homeric touch: —
Fiercely they leaped and yelped.
The battle game was fine.
A eager crowd did watch the fight
’Twixt Jinkin’s dog and mine.
“Sool him Mike,” Mat Jinkins bawled
When, like a active cat,
My foxey gripped he’s opponent
And shook him like a rat.
The scraggy brute did battle on,
But lacked he’s early skill
Against my fiend foxey,
In the rough and tumble mill.
I was lectured by the missus
When I came home to dine,
About the fierce encounter
’Twixt Jinkin’s dog and mine.
.. . .Billo: It certainly is “No Joke,” nor is it verse;
and what it means passes human comprehension....
W.K.8.: No use.... Geoffrey: It has no resemblance
to a true sonnet, the idea is small and one line
limps painfully. Look up the pronunciation of
“cerements.”.... Steve B.: No use to us.... Red
and Black: Verse too lumpy... .K.R.M.,: Very little
there... .E.J.D.: Not up.... D.V.H.: You take a
great number of lines to get to the jokelet.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
C.A.C.: You are sadly in need of some drawing
lessons... .J.C.M.: You can’t make the acquaintance
of the accountant yet....F.5.: Pencil sketches use-
less except as suggestions... .8.W.: Painfully old
idea... .G.H.: Some improvement, but still wooden
and flat... .11. C.: Drawing not up; will use one as
suggestion.... J.J.8.: Nowhere near it.... J.H.:
Pair of elongated females don’t impress u 5....
C. : Both out E.W.: Penwork too weak; but
will use one as suggestion... .X.E.: Not new....
R.H.C.: One too scratchy ; the other has a curiously
oversea look about it....V.P.5.: All profiteers are
horrible, but yours is the most dreadful to date....
F. 8.: Promising, but line a bit too hesitant yet.

Here is Something
New to Clean Your
Artificial Teeth!
Plaza Dental Soap for Artificial Teeth is the only
preparation of its kind that cleanses artificial dentures, and
keeps them sanitary in the way approved of by the dental
profession.
Plaza Dental Soap does not contain grit of any kind,
and cannot injure any plate or bridge in the slightest degree.
There is nothing that should be cleaned more carefully than
artificial teeth, even a microscopic scratch allows a place for
germs to collect and cause trouble. You should be more
careful in cleaning your plate and artificial teeth than in
cleaning a watch, for the surface is even more delicate.
Plaza Dental Soap is a combination of harmless anti-
septic cleansing agents, which quickly take off the food films
and polish the surface of the plate to perfection. Start using
Plaza Dental Soap the minute you get your teeth,
continue to use it regularly, and you are sure to receive the
utmost satisfaction from your teeth all the time you have
them. You will be astonished how much smoother and
comfortable your plate will feel after cleansing with Plaza
Dental Soap.
Plaza Dental Soap, for Cleansing Artificial Teeth, in dainty
clear-glass containers, 1/6. Sold everywhere; or post free,
upon receipt of the price, from the manufacturers: Sheldon

A Hundred and One.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH, once I wrote to a poor friend.
And once I wrote to a rich ;
But I did not write to the
righteous,
For I was down in the ditch.
The ditch that’s not like the trenches,
Where a man has a chance to fight;
But the place he flees from the wenches
And drink, and is hid from sight.
One friend was a Western bushman
From the plains where I had been ;
And one was a lord from England,
Where the trees —and men —are green.
I wrote to them both as brothers,
For, oh! but the days were grim.
But I wrote to one as “Your Lordship,”
And I wrote to the other as “Jim.”
The letters were written and posted,
And I said to myself, “It’s done!
Now the chances are one in a hundred,
And the odds a hundred to one.”
And ever the slings and arrows
Of Misfortune pelted my hide;
And ever the postman’s whistle
Went past on the other side.
And daily I grew more bitter,
For the facts weren’t known to me,
That the Lord was out in the bushland
A-seeing what he could see ;
And Jim was down at the Bourke Hotel
On a glorious jamboree.
So I wrote to the friend who was righteous,
But never a line wrote he.
Did ever you watch for the postman,
With nothing but that to do?
Till he flitted past like a ghost-man
In hours when he wasn’t due?
Or vanished like down from the thistle,
Or hope from the passing years—
Till the sound of a phantom whistle
Was loud in your haunted ears?
But the postman came unexpected.
And knocked at the door —he did !
And his Lordship sent me a hundred,
And Jim, he sent me a quid.
And they wrote to me, both, as brothers
(Making allowance for rank),
Though his Lordship addressed me as
“Mister”
And Jim as a “Blanky Blank.”
And Jim’s quid went with the jim-quids
To the Land of the Bar and Shelf:
And a fiver went to the landlord
And. a fiver went to meself.
The ninety bought an allotment,
Which went where allotments go—
So I’m dow r n in the same old ditch again,
And I’m writing to let yer know.
HENRY LAWSON.
A Suburban Juliet.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YOUNG Mr. Don was drifting listlessly
towards the south suburban board-
ing-house when he first saw her. Mr.
Don had just completed a hard day s work
and was fatigued after the heat and burden
thereof. He was feeling out of conceit with
life, existence was an empty thing, breathing
was an arduous business. Better to have
died young, far better never to, have been
born. Mr. Don’s hat was on the back of his
head, his hands were thrust into his trousers
pockets (his empty trousers pockets), his
tallish, well-knit figure had a despondent
stoop, he dragged his feet, rasping the
broken asphalt, and when he spat at the
bob-tailed cat in the cobbler’s door it was
with a sort of sad malevolence.
Donny’s thoughts drifted with him:
“S’e’p me two men ’n’ a dorg, why don’t a
bloke cut loose ’n’ do a guy outer this ’ere
mud-pie kinder life, go to sea, or rob a bank,
or hang hisself? Here’s me grindin’ me
bones from year’s end to year’s end, gravelly
arf me time, without the arf-tizzy to buy a
pack iv fags, dry ez a bone, the bloom off
me ’at, ’n’ the old original me peekin’ through
me pants aft, ’n’ Mother Buddy waitin’ at
’er ’ome fer lost souls with two synthetic
chops from the saddler’s, a lion-’earted per-
tater, ’n’ a sample iv rubber goods masker-
adin’ as a slice iv pie. Garrt! Struth,
there’d be more fun in bein’ embalmed!”
At this point a small, long-wool dog like
the little lamb Mary had on wheels engaged
Don’s attention. The creature ran along on
the safe side of a garden fence, barking at
master Nicholas with an excess of valor
quite absurd in so fat, so inept and so ple-
thoric a poodle. Don rapped at the fence,
and Tiny simulated ungovernable passion.
He was rather angry before, but now his one
desire was to tear the stranger limb from
limb. Donny lingered to lure the dog along
to where a broken paling offered him a
chance of booting him out of bounds.
Nicholas wanted to kick that dog. his whole
day had been leading up to it. If he could
only get a good kick in he might go home to
his synthetic chop, if not with pleasure, at
least with resignation.
_ Mr. Don kicked and rapped his sensi-
tive shin sharply against the broken paling.
The poodle gave a startled yap, turned a
back handspring, and retreated, howling.
Donny looked covertly left and right to be
sure his great mistake had not been observed
and then leaned on the fence and rubbed his
shin.
“Whoo!” said Nicholas Don. “Efff!”
He took his other hand to the injured tibia
and rubbed hard. There were tears in his
eyes. It had been a rotten day : misfortune
had marked him for her own. “Eff-f-f-f!
Mother, it ’urts!” said Nicholas.
The dog was coming at him again. There
was still _ hope. He sought a stone. He
enticed his prey, scraping insolently at a
paling, and raised his missile for the fatal
blow.
“Oh, please, please, don’t!” said the voice.
Nicholas Don turned sharply to the right,
a burning expletive upon his lip. He turned
smartly to the left, a hotter objurgation ready
for the leap. -
“He won’t really bite,” said the voice. “He
is only pretending.”
It was a peculiar voice; a soft, appealing
voice, with a tinge of reproach in it that
Donny found most irritating and unjust.
“Cri!” he snorted, “who’s turn is it to boil
oyer { \\ ho’s stuck fer all the trouble up
to now
lhen he caught sight of her. She was at
xv , u P s tair window, and in the eye of
Aicnolas Don she was a thing of unbeliev-
able beauty. Her hair, which was short
and curling thickly about her small, shapely
nead, was the color of new butter. He could
detect the bright blue of her eyes even at
inis distance. Her complexion had the clean
pink and milk of an expensive wax doll, and
her teeth were even and as white as china.
fwcholas dropped the stone, and raised
I* 1 ® hat. For once lie was nonplussed.
Strewth!” he told a bosom friend a day
later, “I was fair stiffened. Believe me,
’twas like openin’ the back gate of Glory
’Allelujah, ’n’ soolin’ a ’oly angel et a suffer-
in’ sinner. Believe me, oh, believe me, I
was grateful to goodness I hadn’t used the
naughty word I’d readied up. It was a
blitlierer. I felt sorter must-go-but-I’ll-
liave-to-stay got-t’-speak-but-mustn’t, ’n’ per-
fectly sane ’n’ collected but fer a street
riot in me ’eart, ’n’ a stampede of cattle
under me ’at. What I did was to work off
a swankin’ old Castilian bow picked up et
one iv them clankin’ secon’-’and drarmers in
me extreme youth. Cri! you’d ’a’ thought
I had two yards of ostrich hide in me lid,
’n’ was dressed to kill in nine bobs’ worth
of nic-kled tin plate. And what’s this I’m
sayin’? Fair dink, I couldn’t keep it from
cornin’ up. I might ’a’ been Hamlick, Prince
o’ Denmark, the way I felt. Sez me dilly
mbs: ‘Beauteous lady, your dorg’s sacred
to me. I wouldn’t ’urt a hair of his tail.
Say the word, ’n’ he can eat off me hand.’”
This is scarcely an exaggeration of Mr.
Don’s attitude towards the interesting
stranger, and far from being displeased by
the seeming grotesquerie, the lair lady leaned
further from her window, and smiled down
upon him with an expression of sweetest
appreciation. “I am so sorry he attacked
you,” she said ; “but he is always petulant
when the milkman is late.”
“Lady, the fault was mine,” said Nicholas
Don.
“I am sure it is not that he dislikes you.”
“It delights me to have you say so, graci-
ous lady.”
Donny bowed again. “Any friend of yours
is a friend of mine, ancj if you will just
point out that particular milkman I will
leave the varlet so that he will never again
dare to keep a dog of youi’s waiting a single
minute.”
“Ah, no, no; you must not do that.”
“It would be a pleasure; it would, in-
deed.”
The divinity smiled down upon him, shak-
ing her head. “Good afternoon,” she said.
Then in a whisper: “Pa might catch me.”
Nicholas Don bowed again with antique
finish, and continued his homeward journey,
but it was a Nicholas revived and rejuve-
nated. He felt refreshed, he walked erect,
square-shouldered, and with the jauntiness
of a man whose worth is recognised, and to
whom the wrnrld is well-flavored and fortune
is kind.
“ ’Strewth, you done it well, Nickie,” said
he. “‘Beauteous lady!’ ‘The vai-let!’ ‘Lady,
the fault was mine!’ Yow ! And the bow !”
Nicholas pushed in a laugh with his right
hand, and patted himself approvingly on the
brow with the left. “ ’Ow she liked it.
Pretty ez a basket iv pansies, she was, V
smilin’ all over like a day iv pure delight.
’N\ sez she, ‘Pa might catch me.’ ” Nicholas
had swung; round a corner. He leaned on the
fence and laughed. He kicked himself affec-
tionately. After all, life had its moments.
Young Mr. Don was conspicuously frisky
at the evening meal. He ate the rubberoid
chop with a relish, he openly rejoiced in the
case-hardened pie, Mrs. Puddy’s bitterly
piteous and sniffingly insistent reflections
on “irreaular pays” as a class left him
spiritually serene. Later he returned to the
scene of his triumph. In the dai-kness he
surveyed the home of the angel. The house
was a weathei'board structure built on the
simple lines of the Ai*k of the Covenant,
gable end on to the street. In front of this,
on the right, a small shop bad been wedged,
its window flush with the asphalt. The house
was available only thi-ough this shop, but it
had a downstair window directly below the
one from which the unearthly fair had shed
her radiance upon him. and the tiny square
of “garden” left over from the shop site was
filled with a luxuriant nepper-tree.
Nickie had passed the place, scores of
times, and on occasions had purchased a
brand of conspicuously innocuous cigarettes
in the gi-ocery, being served, he recollected,
by a large plump man of 50, with floating
whiskers and a wicked squint, who was
always bunched in the window corner, read-
ing slim fiction of the misused kind that is
sold in second-hand baskets at a penny a
batch. Mr. Don remembered some of the
titles: “For Love Alone,” “Because She
Loved Him,” “Love that Cannot Die,”
“Love’s Reward.” and so on.
“That’s ‘pa’ for a quid,” said Mr. Don.
“Pinch me, but how do these things happen?
Her the natural product iv a tup’ny trades-
man with a face about ez pleasin’ to the
view ez a steamed ham, ’n* a figure like a
bale of hair.” But our hero was not dis-
pleased with, the reflection. The fact that
her parent was unquestionably earthly de
his lady in the air appear more accessible.
Going to work next moi’ning, Nickie saw
nothing of Miss Bradd (Bradd was the name
over the shop door), but her pa was sweep-
ing out, and Mr. Don wished him a cordial
“Good morning,” a compliment that evoked
no response. But in the evening Nicholas
had better luck. Tiny was at the front
fence again, and the young man lingered to
make a few ingratiating remarks. He was
very cordial to Tiny, and highlv complimen-
tary, too. He contrived to make it appear
that he had never met a doer that apixealed
so strongly to his regard. Here, at length,
was a dog' a man could live with.
“Good evening!” She was at the upper
window again. There was a flattering sug-
gestion that she had been waiting for him.
She was smiling as before, and as she
leaned forward a red rose fell from her
breast.
Nicholas vaulted the low fence, and
seized that rose. He kissed it with the
grace and fervor of a Sbakspearean hero. “I
hoped you would come,” he said. Mr. Don’s
diction was perfect. He infused a glow into
the simple words. As on the occasion of
their first meeting, he felt himself impelled

IF SO, HERBAL ZAM-BUK WILL BRING YOU QUICK RELIEF.
£AM-BUK has brought the treatment of skin affections to
a point of perfection never before attained. The discovery
of this remarkable healing balm marked a ‘new era in the home
self-treatment of those irritating, troublesome skin complaints that,
before the advent of Zam-Buk, were so liable to become chronic
because of the indifferent and inefficient treatment resorted to.
Nothing else known to science has such a wonderful influence on an
injured or diseased skin as Zam-Buk.
When Zam-Buk is applied to sores, ulcers, eczema and poisoned
wounds all corruption is drawn out, germ-life is destroyed, and new
skin created; those troublesome ringworms and scalp sores that
attack the children and cause mother so much worry are cleared
away; and aggravating piles are soothed and relieved, and finally
banished, in a manner most comforting to the patient.
In short, when Zam-Buk is applied to any skin disease,
inflammation and irritation are allayed, festering is stopped,
sore places made well, and new, healthy skin takes the place of
the old and diseased tissues.

“ It’s simply marvellous the way
that Zam-Buk relieves the burn-
ing irritation of eczema,” says Mrs.
E. M. Bright, of 115 Queen Street,
Bendigo, Vic. “A bad attack of the
disease on both hands incapacitated me
for three months. My skin was in a
frightful state. I tried a host of ad-
vertised remedies, and practically
everything else I could think of in my
search for rdlief, but nothing had any
real effect until I applied Zan\-Buk.
“ Zam-Bulc was instantly cooling
and soothing, and took the fiery irri-
tation out of my skin as if by magic.
I soon began to sleep better at night,
and solely through Zam-Buk the ter-
rible eczema was rapidly and thor-
oughly overcome

into an artificiality of manner not altogether
unusual in him in the course of amorous
adventure, but in this case the artifice was
quite involuntary.
“Hush!” she said, pointing towards the
shon. “Pa is there, you know.”
Nicholas was hidden from the street by
the pepper-tree. He kissed her rose, and
tossed it back to her. “Kiss it,” said he,
“and give it to me.”
She kissed the petals three times, and
dropped the flower in his face. “Now it is
for ever,” he whispered.
“You know you don’t mean that.” She
breathed the words down to him.
“By my soul!” He raised his hat, lie
raised his right hand holding the rose. The
attitude left nothing more to be said on this
point. Nicholas Don was surprising him-
self every moment. “Will you come down
to me, fair lady?” he pleaded.
“Oh, no. I dare not.”
“Ah, please, please do!”
“Not now. Not yet.”
“Do you like me?”
She laughed, nodding her head twice, and
Nickie experienced a strange surge of feel-
ing. Emotions entirely new to his raffish
soul were at play -within him. This old
game of wooing, with its constant repetitions
of tricks and turns, suddenly assumed a vast
significance.
“I love you !” He spoke with Romeo’s fire.
She laughed like a child. “My name is
Dora,” she said, and closed the window.
Nicholas Don went his way, with a rose
crushed in his hand, and a word singing in
his head. This time it was coir-matting
steak, and a pudding like a composite ball,
but less destructible, and Mrs. Buddy’s
lament was of the prodigious amount of
washing some people expect “along of bed
and board for 25 shillin’ a week,” but Nickie
gave heed to neither, his mind was occupied
ringing the poetical changes on that ador-
able word “Dora.”
At 9 that night Nicholas Don was under
the window again. From the shadow of
the pepper-tree he threw pebbles at the pane,
till the window was softly opened.
“Dora! Dora!” he called her in a whisper.
Won’t you come?”
She extinguished her light and returned
to the window. She answered in a whisper,
refusing.
He pleaded with her, but she shook her
CU j j* n Ie moon light. He seized a limb,
and drew himself into the pepper-tree. There
among the branches he was much nearer,
and they could converse in whispers, but he
could not reach her little hand. He could
only tell her in a sort of rhapsody liow
beautiful she was, and how he loved her,
feeling all the time like a character in an
acted romance, while refusing to admit any
absence of reality. He acknowledged a fine
ideal to be lived up to, that was all.
Her father’s voice called to her from the
distance, and she answered, “Presently!
Presently!”
. know! I know!” Nickie almost cried
aloud. ‘You should have said ‘Anon!
Anon. Its Juliet. We. are Romeo and
(irm.' j. jl s our sec ond time on earth.”
lhey died in a tomb,” said the girl sadly.
‘'Good God, yes!” The thought quite de-
pressed him. He took it home with him,
and brooded on it. “ ’Struth!” said he in
revolt, “what’m I grousin’ erbout. There’s
a flash Dago gets hisself in a nell iv a knot
with his bit iv cuddle ’bout arf a billion
years ago, ’n’ here’s me pesterin’ meseif
bald’eaded jest because, as it ’appens, I’m
playing a game of two-up of somethin’ the
same sort. Cri! Ain’t all gom' glorious 7
Don’t she soften to me a fair treat V Ain’t
I goin’ to butt in one iv them days, ’n’ grab
me little ’andful? You bet I am. Well,
get asleep, yeh shrimp-’ead, ’n’ dream iv
that girl. That girl! Gorstruth, ain’t she
the wonder iv the world ! ’N’ then p’r’aps
not to get her. Gorstruth! Gorstruth!”
Niekie put up his hands as if to defend him-
self from the falling heavens.
Five times in a fortnight Niekie pleaded
with Dora to come down to him, and always
she refused, and always the balcony scene
from “Romeo and Juliet” was repeated,
Niekie in the pepper-tree, Dora at her win-
dow.
“It can’t go on fer ever,” Nicholas Don
told himself again and again. “S’elp me,
I’ll have her down if I have to fire the
humpy ’n’ rescue her in her shirt.”
Then one evening, as Niekie was coming
from work, a tremendous resolution drove
him into Bradd’s shop and straight for the
door leading to the dwelling. Bradd jumped
and intercepted him.
“Where yeh goin’?” demanded the grocer
suspiciously.
“Well, I wasn’t designin’ to loot the ’appy
home, or to pinch the missus,” replied Mr.
Don. “I’m jest payin’ Miss Bradd a call
on her afternoon ’ome. She’s a great little
ole friend iv mine. We met at a hop—select
trifle iv a darnce, yeh know, up et Morri-
son’s.”
“Met her at a dance, did you? You’re a
liar! If you ain’t out of this in 10 seconds
I’ll knock half your head off with this mallet.”
“That naughty temper will be gettin’ you
your face all broke,” said Nicholas. “Where’s
the ’arm in a decent bloke lookin’ in on your
daughter once in a way?”
Bradd pushed his face into Don’s. “Get
out o’ me shop, you prowlin’ bla’guard, afore
I get real dangerous.” Bradd’s squint
looked venomous at this moment, and he had
taken a long, worn ham-knife in hand, and,
despite his pennant whiskers, his paunch
and his large face, reminiscent of risen
dough, he appealed to Niekie as a man who
would use that kind of a dirty w r eapon.
Nicholas retreated. Bradd followed him
to the door, and watched him off. Don
did not raise his eyes to her window as he
passed, but, looking back from the corner he
saw the big, pallid grocer still at his shop
door. Bradd made a menacing gesture with
the ham knife.
When next Nicholas stopped at the house
there was a light in her room. He had
gathered a few pebbles, when he noticed that
the window of the downstair room was
slightly lifted. An instantaneous resolution
carried him along. He opened the window
very softly, he climbed into the room and
crossed the floor towards the opposite door.
There was a light in a back room down a
passage, and in this passage was a narrow
staircase. Without a moment’s hesitation
Nickie stepped into the passage and crept:
to the stairs. He mounted quietly but
quickly.
The room of his beloved was right before
him. He knocked softly on the panel, and
then opened the door. He advanced one
foot into the room.
She was coming across the floor towards
him. Beholding him she stopped in con-
sternation. Their eyes met. In his slie
read amazement, horror, anguish and despair.
While you might have counted 10 he stood
so. The fair-faced woman he beheld was
seated in a wheeled chair, which she pro-
pelled with her hands. She was wholly
without legs.
A hand fell on Nickie’s shoulder; a voice,
the voice of Bradd, spoke in his ear.
“What the devil are you doing here with
my wife?” it said.
EDWARD DYSON.
Benson’s Fall.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BENSON knew that he should not have
done it. From childhood, any large,
empty space, below him, had always
filled him wxin terror. The vo.d seemed always
to leer, familiarly. Still leering, it would
start to stretch outwards and ever out, to-
warus rummy, ns great rush outwards
created a vacuum, in the middle deeps, whose
suction tugged at Benson, inviting him to
make the swift descent, until he drew back,
tingling with the mingled ecstasy and horror
of a mad rush through endless abysses of
space. He would crouch back, with twitch-
ing face, while imaginary gravity and accel-
eration seemed to carry his hapless body
towards the end of their dominion. The
smashing stop, which probably meant the
end of all things earthly, had never yet
come; always his overstrung nerves had re-
acted in time. Until recently Benson had
tenderly respected his failing, for many
years, by carefully avoiding all suspicious
places. Then came that blithering series of
lessons: How to Become a Master Person-
ality. Benson lyas doing fairly well; in the
fulness of time he would do better, but lie
jumped at the chance of making numerous
short-cuts. For ten paltry guineas the wis-
dom of the ages became his, in twelve parts;
after that failure could only be his own
fault. The Great Ones Who Knew insisted
that he who would conquer must first over-
come all weaknesses.
Which explained why Benson was stand-
ing on a great steel girder which would form
part of the tenth floor of a new office build-
ing, with nothing but other girders and a
few planks and scaffolds faintly punctuating
a vast, unbelievable amount of space between
himself and the ground. To get there had
been only too easy. The construction engi-
neer was his particular friend, Jim Hardy.
He had casually expressed a wish to see one
of the steel-boned giants in the making;
Jim had jumped at the chance of showing
the best goods in his shop. As a matter of
course, Hardy had carefully guarded his
novice-friend as they mounted ever higher
Resolve was so. strong in Benson that he
actually held his enemy forcibly captive for
a long time. He appeared calm and natural •
had he shown even a part of his ordinary
fear the alert Hardy would have turned back
long since. At the summit of their climb
they paused to look down on the spreading
miles of bricks and mortar. One sweeping
glance, and Benson’s resolution simply turned
to water; the strain of imposing his will on
a body in revolt became too great. liis will
was hurled aside, rent, torn to shreds by a
howling gale of fear. Just as Hardy half
turned away the old vertigo swept over Ben-
son, loosening his joints. Slowly he toppled oil'
the girder and reached down into space, as
if to embrace to the full the wild ecstasy of
motion. Down he swept, his senses pain-
fully keen. It was as he had always
imagined it would be. His body fell
with an ever-increasing speed which
made his nerves hum. The vivid dread
of his quick ending vied with the thrill of
a superlative joy .of motion. The dark blur,
which he knew to be the ground, approached
him with vast strides, yet, so much quicker
were thought and feeling, that he had time
to realise just what was happening. All his
life, at odd moments, he had wondered
whether the intelligence which to him
jneant man continued to exist, intelligently,
after death. He had wondered, but had
never really cared to know. Now he would
know only too soon. The prospect became
appalling; time enough to find out when
a worn-out body made earth-life a burden.
A fiery, passionate rejection of the coming
new-life filled him as the dark blot arose
and swallowed him.
Like a great, cool pool it took him into
its depths and brought the downward rush
to a smooth stop. So, then, this was the
swift, easy end ! His intelligence told him
that earth had been reached ; positively that
which had been his body had been grievously
battered, but the ejection of the life from
the flesh had been as the swift, smooth
gushing of water from a faucet. He had
solved the mystery. The intelligence sur-
vived the death of the body, for now, even
as the horrified crowd gathered and
scrambled to huddle and gaze, full of futile
emotions, he was able to calmly note these
facts. His mind worked as keenly as ever,
but he could well consider himself to be
new-born and helpless, for his senses were
nothing but a blur. Everything about him
was hidden in a dark haze, without form,
sound or smell. Could he not feel any-
thing? As he turned his mind to this he
seemed to suddenly realise that he was all
feeling; a feeling of awful oppression; his
whole self seemed to be suffocating, strang-
ling, before having a real chance to live the
new life. He struggled furiously, fatuously.
As hope and life seemed to shrink to pin-
points the pressure ceased and a vital flood
began to sweep through him, until some
measure of his old strength returned to him.
Bravely, he opened his eyes, to face his new
life.
He found himself looking into Jim Hardy’s
anxious face. Jim had a death-grip on his
collar.
