[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sharply the outline of a spire
Leaps from a mass of eucalypt
To scale the amber heaven, tipped
With one last flash of fading tire.
To break the silence of the h@ur
There is no voice, no step>, no stir;
Only the croak of frogs, the whirr
Of crickets hid in leaf and flow’r.
And solemnly the darkness creeps ;
On dove-like wings Night settles down j
Lights twinkle in the little town ;
The stars come out; the valley sleeps.
And so, beloved, silently
In thine own land the shadows fall
On grassy lawn'and orchard wall,
On shining sand, on troubled sea;
On paths thy feet shall never tread,
On fields thine eyes shall never see,
And on thy new home, strange to me,
That silent City of the Dead.
And Peace come with them! Peaoe to all {
Long Peace to us who work or wait,
Till we, as thou, are one with Fate,
And on us too the Night shall fall!

The Genealogy of Genius.
Genius, like everything else, is a matter of
atoms and vibrations. (Pass, for the present, the
delicate theory that the atom is really a sort of
solidified vibration—half-a-dozen spirit-waves tied,
as it were, into a knot of matter.) You may con-
strue genius in terms of sound. It is pretty gener-
ally known that the imperfect human ear only
hears a small section of the universe’s sound-
vibrations. When the sound travels too slow, Or
too fast, the ear-drum doesn’t respond to it—or
not so as to influence the brain. And it is gener-
ally known that there is a great difference in
human ears. Some people hear low notes, and
not high ; and vice-versa. Some have a small
range in the centre cf the ordinary scale, and hear
neither low nor high. Anything less than about
16 vibrations per second, or more than about
38,000, the best of ears misses altogether.
So with minds. It is common to speak of slow
wits, or quick. (Astonishing how many deep
scientific truths lie hid in common talk, familiar
expressions —the condensation of humanity’s
200,000-year experience.) And the slowness, or
quickness, refers to nothing but the vibrations of
cerebral atoms. Doubtless an idiot’s brain
vibrates; but it is slower than 16 per second—the
normal mind cannot hear it. Doubtless a maniac’s
' ibrates ; but it is faster than 38,000 per second
(or its speed is negative, reversed, needing the
minus sign)—the normal mind cannot hear it.

From this construct your mind-measure or

NOUSOMETER-COMMENTARY.
The notation is arbitrary—comparative, not
positive.
Generally speaking, a mind’s class is fixed by
heredity, its place in the class by environment.
Classification must be based on estimate of final
results ? But probably most men, at some times,
have risen or fallen from their ordinary class.
(Great wits are sure to madness near allied, And
no partitions do their minds divide.—Dryden,
amended. )
Classification depends on quality, not on
quantity of work. A 10,000-mind like Southey’s
or Trollope’s may produce far more than a 31,000-
mind like Francis Adams’s; and, by aocumula-
tion, their work may have more value, as ]
shilling's are worth more than one sovereign. I
a sovereign is gold, and worth much more tha
shillings weight for weight.
A nousometer is in effect a brain-thermomete
since quicker vibrations mean more heat, and co
verse!y. Hence the virtue of Stockton’s pret
tale (was it Stockton’s?) of the man who vro
well twice in his life—once in the delirium of fir
love, once in the ecstasy of fatherhood; f
love is a fever.” Hence, too, the brillian
things written by alcohol, opium, and cocaine
even by tea and coffee: all “ stimulants i.
things which make heat and hasten vibrations.
.Large heads tend to extension, small heads
intension of genius. But there is no relation b
tween genius and hea,d-size, since genius ream
from the rapid-vibration of a particular set,
no means all, of the brain-atoms. Cerebral fee
ration has never got out of the hair.
Ergo: there is genius in music ( e.g ., Pag
P ,nl > Rubinstein), in sculpture and paintii
\e.g., Michael Angelo), and in all the forms o
human achievement—coincidently, so far as tl
individual is concerned, with absolute idiocy
other forms.
Grenius implies the abnormal development
one or more sets of faculties, the abnormally fa
vibration of one or more sets of brain-atoms, a
the expense of the development and vibration-ra
of other sets.
Ergo : join the ends of the nousometer, and com
plete the circle at the undiseoverable junction
point between madness and idiocy.
Ergo: the mind, like the moon, has an unsee
side the side of the minus vibrations. If w
only knew the poetry and nobility of Bedlam !
♦ * * *
Thus genius is disease. Its hypertrophy in
volves a corresponding atrophy. It is in the va
of the curious evolutionary struggle-up. Death
no - vibration : the more conscious - vibratior
the more Life; everything living pants for mor
Life; hence the continual effort for a faster vibra
tion in the brain, the seat of consciousness. Th
continual_ hurling of some primeval 25-vibratio
ape’s brain against its bars—its effort to thin
and know —produced a brain with a capacity i
parts for 35-vibrations—the genius of his age
He taught others to think and know a little mor
and hurl a little harder, and presently 35-vibra
tion brains—first in parts, then in the whole—
became common. By this time the contemporary
ape-genius was trying to get 60-vibrations out o
a 45-vibration brain, and killing himself in th
effort. But he showed the way up.
* * * *
Genius is disease because its brain, or part of it
is continually worked beyond the normal margin
of safety. If it could keep its head cool and its
feet warm and work up to, say, 5000 vibrations i
might live in health till 90—but it would not be
genius. So when a noble notion comes along
genius straightway pumps all the blood of it
body into a corner of its brain and takes that
noble notion and moulds it into something nobler
still—and its head is fire, and its feet are ice, anc
it has cut five years off its life. This applies nol
alone to genius. If any man is content to stay on
the vegetable level, and avoid emotional expendi-
ture, he will probably live long and die “ happy
and for the sake of life lose all that makes life
worth living. If he does anything—anything
which costs—he shortens his life by so much.
The thermometer of the “ Trip to Chinatown”
comedian has an exact mental analogue. Say you
start with 50 units of vitality transinutable into
brain-vibrations. You may spend 25 units every
day (regaining them in food and sleep), keep 25
in reserve, make “a fine old man ” of yourself,
and be “ nobody ” all the time. But if you want
to be “somebody,” to create something in any
field of labor, or even to try to create something,
you must spend 35 units in an hour and accept
death or paralysis at 30 or less. That is the con-
dition which genius welcomes—because it must :it
is built that way.
* * • *
To make a genius is as easy—or as difficult—as
making a cheese. You want from one parent a
good-quality blood with plenty of red corpuscles :
from the other a good-quality brain and a touch
of nervous disease. If you desire much and con-
sistent work you will need a good heart as well,
to pump the blood up continuously ; but for a
few flashes a weak heart and stimulants suffice.
The brain need not be what is called a good all-
round brain—one or two extremely weli-marked
convolutions are all it wants. The more good
convolutions, you have, of course, the greater your
genius (in extension, not necessarily in inten-
sion), but the supply of rich blood must be assured.
The brain-quality is needed to get up speed ; the
blood is to enrich the atoms, who have to vibrate
hard, and must live well. The effect of the nerve-
disease is not precisely understood, but it probably
clarifies and attenuates the medium between the
atoms, so that motion is more readily communi-
cated. Doubtless, if the universe gives it time,
humanity wiil go on quickening its normal rate of
brain-atoin vibration till the idiot of a.m. 250,000
(say) is on an intellectual level with the genius of
to-day. By that time, geniuses will be propagated
by Government in batches as required to suit the
demands of the community. Genius will never
propagate itself.

first to Eton, then to Leipsic. Dickens had
absurdly exalted ideas about securing him a great

mother. Though he got on better, as might be
expected, after his father’s death, and worked
hard, he was always a muddler, and killed All

THE CAP AND BELLS.
A queen was beloved by a jester,
And once when the owls grew still
He made his soul go upward
And stand on her window-sill.
In a long and straight blue garment,
It talked before morn was white,
And it had grown wise by thinking
Of a footfall hushed and light.
But the young queen would not listen ;
She rose in her pale night-gown,
She drew in the brighter ing caseunent
And pushed the brass bolt down.
He bade his heart go to her,
When the bats cried out no more,
In a red and quivering garment
It sang to her through the door,
The tongue of it sweet with dreaming
Of a fiutter of flower-like hair,
But she took up her fan from the tabie
And waved it off in the air.
“I’ve cap and bells,” he pondered,
“ I will send them to her and die.”
And as soon as the morn had whitened
He left them where she went by.
She laid them upon her bosom,
Under a cloud of her hair,
And her red lips sang them a love-song.
The stars grew out of the air.
She opened her door and her window,
And the heart and the soul came through,.
To her right hand came the red one,
To her left hand came the blue.
They set up a noise like crickets,
A chattering wise and sweet,
And her hair was a folded flower,
And the quiet of love in her feet.

EUTHANASIA.
(Fin de Steele.)
Yes, this rich death were best:
Lay poison on thy lips, kiss me to sleep,
Or on the siren billow of thy breast
Bring some voluptuous Lethe for life’s pain,
Some languorous nepenthe that will creep
Drowsily from vein to vein ;
That slowly, drowsily, will steep
Sense after sense, till, down long gulfs of rest
Whirled like a leaf, I sink to the lone deep.
It shall be afternoon,
And roses, roses breathing in the air !
Deliciously the splendour of deep June,
Tempered through amber draperies, found us-
fall ;
And, like a dream of Titian, let thy hair
Bosom and arms glow all,
Clouds of love’s sunset, o’er me there :
Kiss that last kiss ; then low some golden tune
Sing, for the dirge of our superb despair.
So, let the clock tick on,
Measuring the soft pulsations of Time’s wing,
While to the pulseless ocean, like a swan
Abandoned to an unrelenting stream,
Floating, I hear thee faint and fainter sing ;
Till death athwart my dream
Shall glide, robed like a Magi’an king,
And ease with poppies of oblivion
This heart, the scorpion Life no more may
sting.
JOHN TODHUNTER.
SONG.
What are lips, but to be kissed?
What are eyes, but to be praised?
What the fineness of a wrist,
What the slimness of a waist?
What the softness of her hair,
If not that Love be tangled there ?
What are lips, not to be kissed ?
What are eyes, not to be praised ?
What is she, that would resist
Love’s desire to be embraced ?
What her heart, that will not dare
Suffer poor Love to linger there ?
These are lips, fond to be kissed,
These are eyes, fain to be praised ;
And I think, if Love has missed
Shelter in the wintry waste,
That this heart may soon prepare
Some nook for him to nestle there.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearue’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty ot
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure, it
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat,and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. VV. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I sulreted
for upwards of seven years, during which peri <1 1 was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently ine ditn-
culty of breathing was so distressing I hat. for nights m
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from’ a sense of duty, as in my case every othei
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the lim" I obtained your
medicine T was confined 10 bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the t re d ment,, until I became,
ns I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, If- \A AI.hEK,
ißalmain, Sydney.” . . .
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
'The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great, anxiety. I tried several tient-
,meats. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
iplasters were applied to the hack and chest without
■ success. , _ , ...
“ I bought a large-size botlle of Hearne s Bronchitis
<Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine foraliout
10 days lie was perfectly cured. —J. PATTERSON,
:Solicitor, Taimvorth, N.S.W.”

whose New and Scientific Treatment, by purifying and
enriching the blood, gives new life and tone to the
whole nervous and muscular systems, and builds up a
new constitution in the most enfeebled. The first week of
treatment brings glad relief, and PERSEVERANCE
ensures a thorough and LASTING CURE.
MEN
Suffering from NERVOUSNESS and DEBILITY and
EXHAUSTION should try Dr. SPEER'S celebrated
Remedies, which strike at the root of the disease. The
symptoms gradually disappear, nervousness and timidity
vanish, vigor and lost health return, sunken eyes retain
their old lustre. The blood-giving principle of the medi-
cine secures a healthy appearance, the patient finds
himself gaining- in weight and flesh, hollow and sunken
cheeks become rounded , the weak and debilitated consti-
tution is restored, and the former sufferer finds himself
permanently cured with all the animation and vigor of
life.

Dr. GS-XDSZBOZKTS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS Sc SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely :—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fuliness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fearof something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt op 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DEBILIT
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “ Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call

reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in

questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.

BEFORE YOU
T. B A
When you go out shopping, consider, think
of the money in your pocket, and take account
of the many stores whose various attractions
are laid before you. There is A, with temp-
tation in the form of a pretty show ; there is
B, whose wiles are innumerable ; and G,
who says that he is the man for your money ;
and so on, throughout a list as long as
George-street, each smiling dealer has some-
thing to say and to offer.
Please Pause!
Hearken not to the song of the syren, sing
she ever so sweetly ; heed not the voice oi
the charmer, charm he never so wisely.
Your pocket’s concerned ; and there are
pirates about. As the poet pertinently puts
it: “ There be land-sharks and water-
sharks,” and it is for you to see that your
dealings are with none of these voracious
monsters. Take warning in time, for it will
be no use when the new taxes come round—
and the tax-gatherer won’t take no for an
answer —for you to plead : There would have
been enough and to spare had I been wise

Fred’s got a nice selection, bnt it isn’t very big
Enough to keep three hundred sheep, three horses
and a pig,
“Enough to base the fortune of a speculative
man,” ■
Yet, while the pillar’s rising, Fred must aid it all
he can.
He’s got to do with this—he mustn t look for that—
Resigning Day-and-Martin, rub his boots with
mutton fat.
No fear of getting tight—
He can’t go out at night,
Nor ever more, with social roar, salute the morn-
ing- light.
Fred has a city appetite that leans to pigeon-pie,
With flask of Chateau-Margaux (or La Rose) to

human joy :
He pulls at it like this— he prods at it like that—
When (by the sun) it should be done, ’tis black as

Assumes a hungry look,
And hastens with tea-bucket to bring water from
the brook.
He cultivates acquaintance with the art of split-

THE GUM-SUCKER’S DIRGE.
Sing the evil days we see, and the worse that are
to be, ..
With such fortitude as sorrow will allow—
We are crumpled side by side, m a world no
longer wide,
And there is no Up the Country for us now.
For the settlement extends till there’s none knows
where it ends —
Spreading silently, you can’t tell when or how—
And a home-infested land stretches out on every
hand,
So there is no Up the Country for us now.
On the six-foot mountain peak, up and down the
dubious creek,
Where the cockatoos alone should make a row,
There the rooster tears his throat, to announce
with homely note
That there is no Up the Country for us now.
Where the emu should be seen, sounds the Army
tambourine,
While the hardest case surrenders with a row ;
And the church-bell, going strong, makes us feel
we’ve lived too long,
Since there is no Up the Country for us now.
And along the pine-ridge side, where the mallee-
hen should hide,
You will see some children driving home a cow;
Whilst, ballooning on a line, female garniture
gives sign
That there is no Up the Country for us now.
And across this fenced-in view, like our friend, the
well-sung Jew,
Goes the swaggy, with a frown upon his brow.
He is cabin’d, cribb’d, confin’d, for the thought is
on his mind
That there is no Up the Country for him now.
And the boy that bolts from home has no decent
place to roam,
No region with adventure to endow ;
But his ardent spirit cools at the sight of farms
and schools,
Hence there is no Up the Country for him now.
Such a settling, spreading curse must infallibly
grow worse
Till the saltbush disappears before the plough.
But the future, evil-fraught, is forgotten in the
thought
That there is no Up the Country for us now.
Better We were cold and still, with our famous
Jim and Bill,
Beneath the interdicted wattle-bough,
For the angels made our date five-and-twenty
years too late,
And there is no Up the Country for us now.

The Finest Cigar Tobacco in the World

good Cigar, have lately been prevented through retrenched circumstances from
indulging in the hitherto expensive luxury.

Some More “Tote” Logic.
Something like twelve months have elapsed
since the Sydney police had their last spasm
of virtue about the illegal “totes” and
“ double ’’-laying shops and miscellaneous
betting hells of their misgoverned city.
Before that time, and for very long before it,
the layers of doubles and other things carried
on business in large shops in the main
thoroughfares, and put their signs on the
doors and windows, and erected flaring lamps
outside to draw special attention to their
whereabouts, and advertised their names and
addresses and their illegal business in the
newspapers—and the somnolent “ cop ” in
his regulation boots and the sad, unseeing
detective plodded past their establishments
every hour, and refused to be aware of their
existence. But, finally, about a year ago,
something happened, and the attention of
the police was so violently drawn by a private
person to what everybody else was fully
aware of, that it seemed as if something was
really going to be done in the matter. One
offender was convicted, and this paper doesn’t
exactly remember what happened to him ;
all it distinctly remembers is that he didn’t
serve his sentence. Then the private prose-
cutor vanished, and the police didn’t take
the matter up in his stead, and the thing
that was just going to occur didn’t happen
after all. But the law officials were vaguely
understood to say that if the hundred or two
of people who openly broke the law every
hour of the day, and far on into the night as
well, kept on doing so for some years longer
they would rise up in their might and really
begin to think seriously of commencing to
consider the advisability of doing the work
for which they get their salaries—or some-
thing to that effect.
* * * *
Then, for twelve months or so, nothings
suddenly continued to happen just as usual.
The illegal betting-establishments were as
public and as notorious as ever, and adver-
tised their addresses as heretofore. Every
horsey individual in the horsey city of
Sydney knew them and talked openly of
them to every other horsey individual. In
the very busiest streets of Sydney, every
Saturday, dozens or hundreds of people could
be seen rushing well-known establishments
and openly “ putting their money on,” and
every other week-day the same spectacle
could be witnessed more or less. But for a
long, long time the police made no sign, and,
there being apparently no law to make the
force do its duty in this particular respect,
neither Parliament nor the Gon - fearing
Ministry inquired the reason. Finally, how-
ever, something seems to have happened—
probably it was brother to the thing that
happened last year—and the law moved once
more. The exact nature of the movement is
thus described in Sydney Telegraph :
About 12 months ago the “tote” shops, particularly
those in Ring-street, became such a general nuisance that
the authorities determined to alter their mode of dealing
With the persons responsible. Previously, the offenders
had been fined a few pounds, but as they were making
large sums daily they were perfectly well able to pay, and
the punishment had no effect as a deterrent. Thev were,
however, warned that, for the future, imprisonment with-
out the option of a fine would he inflicted for any but the
first offence. This had for a time a salutary effect, but of
late the proprietors of these places have carried on their
business as openly as before. The attention of the autho-
rities having been drawn to the matter, Detective-sergeant
Johnstone was sent round to the different establishments,
and an intimation was made to them that unless they dis-
continued their illegal practices action similar to that
threatened last year would be taken The warning has
ostensibly had the desired effect, and the shutters are up
at the best-known shops at which a totalisator was the
chief stock-in-trade.
* * * *
If this report represents the exact nature
of the case, the most surprising feature of
it, in The Bulletin’s opinion, is that no
one has yet arrested or suspended or dis-
missed the above-mentioned detective and
the person or persons who sent him on his
errand. The business of the police is to
enforce the law, the whole law, exactly as it
stands. The officer who called upon these
law-breakers knew of their existence, their
whereabouts, and the fact that they were
breaking the law ; if he didn’t know these
things he couldn’t very well have called on
them and delivered his warning. The
authorities by whom he was sent must have
known these things also, else they could
hardly have sent him. Yet it is openly
announced that instead of doing the duty for
which they are paid by the country, and
arresting the offenders, they merely advised
them not to do it again, and thus assisted
them to escape justice. The keeping of
“ tote ’’-shops is just as illegal as murder or
bigamy or embezzlement on a large scale,
and the above action was just as remarkable
as if a serious-minded “ cop ” had been sent
to call on Deeming, w r hen decisive evidence
was collected against that persistent widower,
and to inform him that if he killed and
cemented many more wives the law would
probably find it necessary to interfere. The
difference between running an illegal gam-
bling-shop and homicide affects the judiciary;
it does not affect the policeman. The duty
of the latter is to “ run in ” all the offenders
he can lay his hands upon and leave the judi-
ciary to sort them out, and he has no more
lawful power to suspend the operation of the
law in one case than in the other. Yet, by
a curious mental kink in the public or the
Legislature or the Gon-fearing Ministry, or
in all three combined, this remarkable cir-
cumstance passes practically unnoticed.
* * * *
In the snufflesome land of New South
Wales the “tote,” when run openly by
racing clubs whose character is a reasonable
guarantee of honest dealing, is illegal and
wholly accursed and a thing not to be
tolerated for a moment. Also Tattersall's
consultations, which were never even sus-
pected of being dishonestly conducted, were
driven out of the province as a thing too
wicked for any Gon-fearing Ministry to
tolerate. Yet, strangely enough, the tote
which is run illegally and dishonestly by
some garish “ crook ” in a dirty room in
an alley-way is tolerated. There are laws
against it, certainly, but as the Ministry
makes no useful effort to enforce them, and
doesn’t call to account the people who ought
to enforce them and fail to do so, and won’t
even move in the matter when it is an-
nounced in the daily papers that these people
are aware of the existence of the evil and
yet have neglected to do their duty about it,
the natural and reasonable assumption is
that the law' is intended to be a dead letter.
The same process of reasoning applies to the
bookmaker, who is also an illegal gambling
machine, yet is allowed to pursue his
avocation publicly without a semblance
of interference. The anti-gambling laws of
New South Wales are a mere advertisement
for a Government of snuffle and hypocrisy,
and the only thing they have done is to
make the evil wurse than it was before.
Apparently that is the only thing they were
intended to do.

The policeman’s chances of promotion
depend chiefly on his record of convictions,
that being tine only way he can prove him-
self an active, enterprising and useful officer.
As lie absolutely neglects to prosecute the
unlawful “tote” keeper, it is practically
certain that he does so because the latter
pays him to be blind and unconscious. By
making the tote nominally illegal, therefore,
the law only makes it necessary for the
keeper thereof to corrupt the police. The
gambling evil remains as great as ever—
—there are such a multitude of well-known
betting-shops that _ no one who wants to
gamble need go unsatisfied—and the element
of blackmail is adrbxl to its other drawbacks.
To supply the blackmail it is necessary for
the “tote ’’-keeper to swindle his customers ;
an honest man can’t live on the business and
meet the demands made upon him, therefore
there are few, if any, honest men left in the
business, and it is ten times lower and dirtier
than it was before tlie law professed to
seriously interfere with it. As the Govern-
ment takes no measures worth speaking of
to enforce the nominal law, the reasonable
assumption is that it is willing that the busi-
ness should continue, and that it should be
low and dirty, and that its protestations
against gambling are mere lying and moral
whitewash. The only other possible assump-
tion is that the Government is blind and deaf
and idiotic and utterly unfit to be at large.

The Bulletin believes in legalising the
tote under strict regulations which will
guarantee the honesty of its management,
and in making consultations legal under like
conditions. The legalised tote would pay
much larger dividends than the surreptitious
one, because it would not be taxed by heavy
demands for blackmail, its operations would
be open, it would be run by reputable
men under efficient supervision, it would
be troubled by less competition, and its
proprietors would not be in such frantic
haste to make a pile before the raid—
which has to happen once in two years or so,
for the sake of appearances—came along.
The legalised tote would not corrupt the
police, for it wouldn’t need to do so. It
wouldn’t necessitate lying on the part
of its owners and customers. It would
kill the illegal tote, partly because it
would pay larger dividfends, and partly be-
cause the lessees would keep a keen look-out
for all persons suspected of infringing their
monopoly—which the police don’t. The
legalised consultation, conducted under
hard-and-fast conditions, is advisable, partly
on the general ground that mankind will
gamble, partly because the money of the
province goes into it just the same whether
it is situated in Sydney or Hobart or Noumea.
And both the tote and the consultation have
other advantages to recommend them. They
could be made handsome sources of revenue ;
the percentage which they could honestly
afford to pay to the State would probably
cover the whole cost of the proposed Old-age
Pension system. They would make gambling
honest and open, whereas at present it is
neither. They couldn’t make the evil worse
than it is, for it is already about as bad
as the general scarcity of money will allow.
They wouldn’t deteriorate the political con-
science ; for that matter a Gon-fearing
Ministry which professes to loathe gambling,
yet tolerates the bookmaker and the swind-
ling tote in the back alley, and which
doesn’t even call its subordinates to account
for allowing the latter to exist contrary to
law, can’t have its political conscience much
deteriorated. And to openly legalise gamb-
ling under needful restrictions is at least
vastly more manly than to prohibit it by law
in public, and yet actively or passively con-
nive at it in private.
» * * *
The tote’s chief opponents are the book-
makers and the pious elements of the com-
munity. The latter, in this paper’s opinion,
have no right to interfere for the sufficient
reason that they have never seriously at-
tempted to suppress the evils which make the
gambling machine almost a necessity. A great
deal could have been done to wipe out the
betting-shops of Sydney if any section of
the community had set itself to systemati-
cally prosecute every tote-keeper every time
his business was found in full blast, and to
continuously draw the attention of Parlia-
ment to the supineness of the authorities in
the matter. As the pious element of the
community, however, has done nothing of
the slightest value, and shows no signs of
doing anything, its anxiety to prevent any
one else moving in the matter is a very use-
less sentiment. As to the bookmaking
fraternity, it is naturally hostile because the
tote means to it at least partial extinction.
The machine that never bolts, never fails to
pay up, never exhales a strong whisky breath
or uses obscene language, and which always
gives fair odds, if adopted in New South
Wales would wipe out several hundreds of
the worst non-producing class in the com-
munity, and thereby make the moral atmos-
phere so much the purer and the economic
conditions of the country so much the better.
And when Postmaster-General Cook, and
the Gon-fearing Ministry in general, and the
clergy ally themselves, in their opposition
to the tote, with the bookmaker and the
welsher and the man who lays doubles in the
shop up the alley-way, it is time for the first
three to consider the nature of the cause
which brings them into such company.
Label Frauds.
The outcry against bogus labels in Sydney has
come none too soon. If the Foreign-traders mean
to allow N.S. Wales to ever become a manufactur-
ing country, it is time some effort was made to
insist upon locally-made goods being placed upon
the market in an honest way. N.S. Wales manu-
factures, or at least those put up by leading
makers, will stand comparison with any imported
lines. Why, then, should three-fourths of Sydney-
made lines go to consumers as Hinglish—quite
Hinglish, you know? That this fraud is being
piactised on a colossal scale there is ample evi-
dence to show. And the effect is disastrous.
Freed from the responsibility given by having the
maker’s name and address on the labels, every-
thing is sacrificed to Cheapness. As long as the
onus can be thrown on the other fellow, the
quality goes steadily down. Hence a solution of
blues tone figures as Worcestershire sauce, sul-
phuric acid and copperas are found in the pickles
and pumpkin pulp and clover seed are put up as
raspberry jam.
* * * *
Hitherto the Anglo-maniac when he got his
eyeglasses focussed on a label, and read “London ”
or “ Manchester,” or “ Birmingham,” on his little
comforts was satisfied, and proceeded to acquire
indigestion without suspecting the cause of his
troubles. When he learns that these names
should really read “Surry Hills,” “Ultimo,”
or Alexandria,” as the real place of manufacture,
he will begin to doubt whether he was right in
blaming the lobster for all his internal afflictions.
-People who dote on the East, and never eat
chutnee or curry unless the label has on it
Calcutta or Hong Kong,” will be equally
grieved to hear that they are really put up by
Chow One Lung or Ali Bey in some filthy Sydney
back slum It is not that the goods are any the
worse for being made in Sydney. The trouble is,
first, tliat the consumers have a right to receive
what they pay for—which they don’t when they
are made to eat lies in the shape of condiments
paid for as imported but really Sydney-made.
And, secondly, the rapid growth of this vast bogus
system has called into existence a host of Chinese
and Hmdoo makers op a small scale, who put up
gaudily-labelled goods sold as English, but made
under the vilest of conditions in old stables and
similar open outhouses.
.*. * * *
The existing law encourages fraud. The Adul-
teration Act appears to be a dead-letter in N S.
Wales except in so far as it applies to milk. Every
other kind of infamous rubbish can be shot into
tins, jars, or bottles and fired upon a long-suffering
public under cover of an English label. No one is
ever prosecuted Parliament is torn with fierce
strife over the lopping of a few boughs in the
.Domain, but not a solitary legislator has troubled
to enquire if the Law prohibits slow poisoning of
the poor m the shape of deleterious cheap goods,
and if not why not ? There is no statute requiring
goods to bear the true name and address of the
maker, or the firm for whom the goods are made.
Digging down through the strata of pre-historic
legislation we find among the relies of hoary anti-
quity a Trade Marks Act, 1868, which for all the
use that is made of it is practically obsolete.
Occasionally it is dug. up to protect a trade-mark
from being stolen m its entirety, when the thief
has means enough to warrant civil proceedings.
Otherwise it is disregarded. It certainly has a
clause which pretends to prohibit the use of a false
address. But the penalty for infringement is just
10s. ihere are no prosecutions under it, of course.
If there were the offender would go out and sell
another dozen to pay the fine. Were the culprit a
criminal of the deepest dye and came up for sen*
tence every day the court has only power to fine
him ±/5, and there is no provision for imprisonment'
» * * *
Under the English law the penalty for a first
offence of this nature is <£2o, and if the same man
comes up again he can get two years’ hard with-
out the option of a fine. If he prevaricates in the
witness-box the presiding Judge can come down
on him with seven years’ penal servitude. Conse-
quently there aren t any bogus labels worth talk-
ing about in England. The risks make the game
unprofitable. But in Sydney—well, it has been
asserted publicly, and never contradicted, that
there are not three grocery firms in the whole of
IM.S Wales upon whose shelves you cannot find
goods with bogus labels. It is the “buv in the
cheapest market doctrine which has done the
evil. People have been taught to deify Cheap-
ness, and by Cheapness to understand low prices
You can go into Sydney stores and buy Worces-
tershire sauce with an almost exact reproduction
of an English label and bearing a London address
for threepence a bottle— ; 3£d. is quite a fair price.
It is made by a Hindoo in Surry Hills. Sauces in
the same-sized bottles from well-known standard
makers cannot be sold under Is. to Is. 3d.
* * * *
In the same stores, if you ask for English
pickles they will give you for sd. or 6d. a bottle
of pickles bearing a Birmingham or London
address, with labels the same color, design, size
and wording as two well-known leading English
pickle-manufacturers, whose goods cannot be sold
m Sydney under lOd. to Is. respectively. The
cheap lines are put up by a black man in a filthy
stable, and the conditions of manufacture beggar
description. Jams, with beautiful Tasmanian
labels, are concocted by Chinamen out of Heaven
only knows what ; these are passed through
an agent and retailed at 3d. per tin. Marmalade,
with a foreign label, is made in Sydney slums
from the orange-peel gathered from dirt-boxes
and the sweepings of theatres. There is no end
to the awfulness of the ingredients in these bogus
goods. The writer spent a terrible fortnight
investigating the matter, and is prepared to sub-
stantiate all he asserts here. He has collected
between 70 and 80 different samples of goods with
bogus labels. He holds the signed receipts of
makers of these goods for the samples he pur-
chased. He has taken witnesses to see the alleged
factories, and watched the process of manufacture.
He has sent people in to buy the same goods (as
English) in the shops, and holds the cash-slips.
He has even (in some cases) been able to
inspect the manufacturer’s books, and he has, in
the presence of a witness, copied the receipts of
certain firms from the delivery-books for these
very goods. He has visited the principals of some
establishments, and has obtained, in the presence
of witnesses, a recommendation from them of these
bogus goods, with a statement as to the price paid
for them. In fact, he holds undeniable legal evi-
dence of the existence of the fraud upon a vast
scale. If anyone doubts, he can be shown the
samples. If he still doubts, he can taste them.
After that no other proof will be required.
* * * *
There can be no doubt that for the protection of
honest manufacturers and dealers, as well as of the
public general]y, legislative action is urgently re-
quited. The evil is not by any means confined to
lines mentioned. Trade generally is fairly honey-
combed with the bogus-label fraud. There are
literally hundreds of other lines, notably cigars,
tobaccos and liquors, which are quite as exten-
sively fraudulent as pickles, sauces and .preserves.
In fact, the only way to escape buying bogus
goods (if you cannot find a firm to deal with which
can absolutely be relied on to throw out all bogus
goods immediately upon detection) is to buy only
Australian goods bearing the names of well-known
makers, or else to buy imported goods bearing the
labels of leading firms only; firms the names of
which you are thoroughly familiar with, and see
that the names appear exactly. Anything closely
resembling the label of a well-known firm you can
be sure is a fraud. “ Crosswell ” is obviously in-
tended to lead the casual observer to believe that
the goods came from Crosse and Blackwell. “ J
T. Morgan” and “J. T. Moore” are not J. T.
Morton, though a hasty glance might lead you to
think they were.
* * * *
The principle by which the buyer takes all risks
without redress is obviously being pushed too far.
It is too much to expect every purchaser to care-
fully inspect every bottle and tin before buying
Oviously effective legislation to protect the people
and especially the poorer classes is a crying need
Who will take the matter up? There is reputa-
tion and success attending any politician ■who is
far-sighted and energetic enough to make himself
master of the subject, and place upon the statute-
books a Jaw requiring every article to bear its
maker's true name and address, and absolutely
prohibiting, under the severest penalties, any


attempt to mislead the public. Surely it is as
much a crime to forge and issue a label—to forge
and issue countless thousands of labels as to
forge and issue a £1 cheque. ttm latter
offence may mean seven years; the former,
involving perhaps twenty-thousand times as much
fraud, measuring the fraud by the money involved,
is punishable at most with a paltry fine.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Sydney Sweater.
The other day, in a Sydney paper, a N.S.W.
clothing manufacturer started to expose the
dismal condition of the sweated tailoresses of
that poverty-stricken capital, and according to
his account the British seamstress who w'as
wept over in the famous “Song of the Shirt ”
was no worse off, if not even a little better off,
than her sister in this bright, free, more-or-less
democratic land. Presumably as a person in
the trade he knew what he was talking about,
and this is how his story ran :
The Postmaster-General pointed out the other day that
trousers were being made at 4£d. a pair. Now, there are
firms in Sydney which only pay 4d. a pair ; the unfortun-
ate women out of this have to pay Id. a pair to provide
themselves with sewing material, leaving only 3d. a pair
for the work. A smart hand will make a pair in three
hours, or at the rate of Id. per hour ; working 15 hours a
day she will make 7s. 6d. a week. A great number of
these people live some distance from town, and they have
to go to the factories three or four times a week, and
unless they walk many miles it costs them a considerable
sum for tram fares. As another instance, take the rates
for pressing. This is the hardest labor in connection with
the trade. A man has to stand before a fire with tre-
mendous heat for nine hours a day, and what does he get
for this ? He is asked to press serge coats for 3d. ; a
good workman at that rate will earn 18s. per week,
or 3s. per day. For such work as this at least
sd. should be paid, and this is low enough. For
tweed trousers these men have been asked to accept
4d. a dozen, or less than 4d. an hour. The sweater
gets nothing out of colonial trousers ; he receives 9d. a
pair for them, and has to pay 4d. for making, fd. for
cutting, 2Jd for trimmings, Id. for pressing, which leaves
Id. to pay boys who carry the work in and out, gas, rent,
firing, brushing and folding, stationer} 7 , office expenses,
wear and tear of factory, and incidental expenses, so there
is evidently nothing left in profit on trousers. Suits are
made by the sweater for 6s. 6d. : cutting will cost 4d. ;
trimmings, 2s. 6d. ; coat-making, Is. 9d.; trousers, sd. ;
vest, 5d.; button-holing, 3d. ; pressing, Bd. ; leaving 2d. to
pay for brushing, folding, &c. Now, what chance have
good established firms, who want to do legitimate busi-
ness, against this sort of thing? As one of the delegates
appointed at a recent meeting, I visited all the ware-
houses in the city to see if some arrangement could not
be made which would do away with this system. I found
that the larger firms were willing to pay.the higher price,
but in the face of competition found it impossible to do
so. They admitted that their profits at the present
time are much lower than when they paid 10s. 6d. for
the lowest quality suit. Some of the. smaller
warehouses feared the Victorian competition. Now, what
is this Victorian competition which .has grown up within
the present year? We know the Victorian workman gets
higher rates than here. Such a thing as trousers being
made for 4d. is unknown there, and the manufacturer
gets better terms from the warehouses. The sweating
system is much worse here than in Victoria, still they can
undersell us. This sweating evil is quite a recent growth.
Eighteen months ago the lowest rate for trousers was
16id., and at that rate we were paying women lOd. a pair,
and after deducting sewing left them 9d. net, which en-
abled them to earn 225. 6d. per week, little enough surely
for the long hours they had to work. This year all the
prices have been cut down, wages reduced, and, unless a
combination is arranged such as the better class of manu-
facturers and warehousemen wish to see, there is no
remedy for this sweating evil.
The Bulletin asks N.S.W. legislators to con-
sider this ghastly problem on its merits without,
for this once, flying off the handle to discuss
the fiscal issue. The fiscal question doesn’t
affect sweating either way—except indirectly.
No doubt Protection creates more employment,
and while the demand thus created keeps ahead
of, or well up to, the supply it keeps up wages,
but as soon as improved machinery enables
supply to keep well ahead of demand sweating
begins. Whether Protection or Freetrade or
Revenue-tariffism or Single-tax is the best
policy isn’t the question here. None of them
is a reliable or permanent panacea. The best
either of them is expected to do is to increase
the aggregate wealth of the country, but to
promote a fair distribution of that wealth
between employer and employe after it is
created is quite a different thing. The Bulle-
tin believes that Protection makes more wealth
to be distributed, but it doesn’t believe for a
moment that Protection by itself causes an
equitable distribution of the wealth. The
great trouble with the sweating evil in N.S.W.
is the fiscal issue. When the Foreign-traders
are in power they do practically nothing to
alleviate sweating because they deny its exist-
ence ; under Foreign-trade, they say, sweating
can’t exist, because that GoD-given tariff policy
makes it, and almost every other evil, impos-
sible. When the Protectionists are in office
they also claim that sweating can’t exist under
their Gou-given system, and they also do little
or nothing. And, meanwhile, it keeps on
existing, and according to manufacturer Nathan
Jacobs, it has, within the last 18 months, in-
creased to such an extent that it is more than
time the two fiscal parties gave up laying the
responsibility on each other, ancl buried the
tariff hatchet long enough to consider the evil
as it is.
A Moral Spasm. •
From the Maoriland anti-betting bill now
before Parliament: —
If any one, for the purpose of earning commission, re-
ward, or other profit, sends or causes to be sent to an3 7
person any circular, notice, advertisement, letter, tele-
gram, or other document which invites, or may reason-
ably be implied to invite, the person receiving it to make
any bet or wager, or to enter into or take any share or
interest in any betting or wagering transaction, or to
apply to any person or at any place with a view to obtain-
ing information or advice for the purpose of any bet or
wager, or for information as to any race, fight, game,
sport, or other contingency upon which betting or wager-
ing is generally carried on, he shall be guilty of a mis-
demeanor, and shall be liable, if convicted on indictment,
to imprisonment with or without hard labor for a term
not exceeding three months, .or to a fine not exceeding
one hundred pounds, or to both imprisonment and fine ;
and, if convicted on summary conviction, to imprison-
ment with or without hard labor for a term not exceeding
one month, or to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds, or
to both imprisonment and fine.
If anyone publishes, or causes or permits to be pub-
lished, in any newspaper, book, pamphlet, or other publi-
cation, any tip, betting odds, or other information or
advice as to betting or wagering upon any contingency
whatever, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanour, and shall
be liable, if convicted, to imprisonment with or without
hard labor for a term not exceeding one month, or to a
fine not exceeding twenty pounds.
If this becomes law the only resource will be
for every paper to keep a duplicate or bogus
editor and proprietor, who will take the re-
sponsibility and do the month in gaol—in fact,
if the police are active, a weekly sporting paper
would have to keep four of them, for every
week one of them would be gaoled for a month,
and except perhaps in February, when it wasn’t
leap year, it would never have less than three
alleged editors in gaol at once. Also, it would
have its own solicitor to invent defences for the
editors. In these hard times the bogus editor
could easily be got for 30s. or £2 a week—any
kind of weary-looking old man would do.
Perhaps a still better device would be to have
women—pretty ones, aged about 22, with big,
pathetic eyes, and fluffy curls, and respectable
widowed mothers—bogus mother kept on the
premises—who would weep in court and em-
brace them frantically when they were led
away to do their month’s “ hard.” Then the
law would feel so bad over it that it would pro-
bably let the editor off altogether. Four sisters
would do admirably for the billet, for they
would meet regularly in gaol and thus the
family wouldn’t be divided and its natural
affections lacerated by separation.
Old Age Pensions.
Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan, M.L.A., writes:—
In reply to your article on the above subject permit me,
as chairman of the Select Committee on Old Age Pensions
in the N.S. Wales Parliament, to say that, although there
may be a discrepancy between the cost of our scheme and
those of Victoria and Maoriland, experience will prove
that £90,000 will be ample for the modified plan we have
proposed. To provide an old age pension for every person
in N.S. Wales over 60 would cost £1,400,000 per annum.
Such a scheme would be beyond our financial compass, so
our committee decided, for a start, to apply the pension
only to necessitous cases, and then the recipients must
be over 60 years of age, 15 years in the country, and
in receipt of less than £5O per year. An estimate
formed by a competent authority went to show that
the sum of £37,000 per annum would be suffi-
cient to provide for those now in receipt of indoor
and outdoor relief, but we calculated that £53,000 more
would be required to provide for the necessitous poor out-
side of these. Persons with relatives in a position to
maintain them could not come on the old-age pension
fund, and, if we make allowance for these as well as for
the large number of men and women who will prefer to go
on working after 60, I think you will find that not more
than 4000 persons would have to be provided for. It must
also be remembered that, for married couples, only 15s.
per week is to be paid. When the scheme of old-age pen-
sions is extended from the experimental to the permanent
stage, as assuredly it will be, the number we shall
have to provide for will be somewhere about that
stated for Victoria by Mr. Kirton. Then your estimate
of £200,000 will be found to be near the mark. These
pensions will undoubtedly solve the problem of the
aged poor. They will remove that feeling of despair
which comes over elderly people in necessitous circum-
stances when they contemplate the desolate future which
lies before them. They will also minimise begging, and
considerably lessen the expenditure on relief works. In
proposing to raise the money for the old-age pensions
from the totalisator, sports, the drink traffic, tobacco,
fines for drunkenness, and breaches of the Licensing Act,
the committee were guided by the idea that some of the
causes of poverty should be made the means of alleviating
the distress of the aged, but whether the revenue comes
from these sources or from the general taxation of the
community, I have no doubt the money will be readily
and gladly voted by Parliament.
In reply to the above, The Bulletin reckons
that an Old Age Pension system which only
provides for those people above 60 who have
been 15 years in the province, who have an
income of less than ,£5O a year, who are not
working, and who have no relatives in a posi-
tion to support them, is a scheme with a good
many restrictions about it—too many to meet
the case. Also, the above letter makes no
mention of the fact that while the scheme is to
cost <£90,000 a year, the Committee only sug-
gested means of raising £54,000, and left the
Treasurer to find the other £36,000. Therefore,
it didn’t even solve the very small part of the
problem which it set itself to deal with, but
passed two-fifths of the trouble on to someone
else.
The Legal Mystery.
Respectable Murray Smith, wise in some
things, snorts scornfully at the proposed Royal
Commission of enquiry into Victorian legal pro-
cedure, not because he is opposed to reform,
but because he can see no possible benefit in
further tinkering with the old black kettle.
When the lawyers of the Assembly had said
their learned says re “periodical revisions of
rules,” the alleged incompetency of the taxing-
master, the “promotion of economy” (!), and
so forth, Murray Smith gave the House a few
quotations from Sydney Smith, Macaulay
and other defunct authorities whose opinion of
the law as they found it is equally true of the
law as it stands to-day, after innumerable
tinkerings in the meantime. “It was not the
professors of the law who were at fault,” adcled
M.S., “It was the system which was imperfect.
Consequently, the law was a trap for the un-
wary, and the despair of the thoughtful iVo
one could'say what teas the law. The best solici-
tor on consultation could only say about it ‘ I
think.’ For that reason he held that no reform
short of a revolution would do any good in the
matter, and he despaired of either lawyers or
laymen being able to cleanse such an Augean
stable.” The motion in favor of a Royal
Commission was duly carried—all such motions
are always carried —but never a lawyer at-
tempted a reply to Murray Smith’s plain
statement of fact. He had settled the question
with eight words. Ho real improvement in
legal administration can be effected (even if the
“sharks” desire reform, which they don’t) as
long as the Law is allowed to revel in its own
indefiniteness. Barristers earn their living,
not by their individual knowledge of the law,
but by their collective inability to understand
it. Otherwise, how could there be dreary
arguments in Equity, or appeals from one
opinion to another opinion ? The legal profes-
sion is a sinful conspiracy of ignorance, and
all jargon-jabber as to “ rules of pleading,”
&c., is intended to divert public atten-
tion from the one thing needful, which is
a Rule of Common Sense in the interpreta-
tion of Common Justice. A Judge, dis-
cussing a social question on a platform, will
talk o! “justice” as something easily to be
discovered by an intelligent, well-meaning per-
son, but in court the same potentate defines
justice as the judgment of the Law, and when
asked for an incontrovertible definition of the
Law the bewigged humbug shrugs his shoulders.
Moreover, he boasts that the perfect beauty of
the civil Law lies in the fact that he can’t say
what it is. Criminal law is allowed to pre-
serve an appearance of finality, especially in
the cases of hanged offenders, merely because
criminals as a class are impecunious; but on
the day that a millionaire is found guilty of
killing his wife the Law, having smugly ad-
mitted that the word “ murder ” defies under-
standing within the meaning of the Act, will
renounce all pretensions to a last dread sentence,
and tell the bloated capitalist to ride away in a
miscarriage of justice with a powdered foot-
man on the box.
Maoriland Government is trying to push
through a Second Ballot Act before the present
Parliament expires. The said Act will be
much wanted at next election, which promises
to be a triangular duel between the National
Ass party, the aggravated Cold Tea Democrats,
and the other Democrats, and where it seems
likely that a lot of minority representatives
will get in merely by splitting the vote. The
Second Ballot is the shortest way out of the
difficulty ; it hasn’t the mathematical and beau-
tiful inaccuracy of Boodlewraith’s Contingent
Vote, but it is easily understandable, and some-
how the Contingent Vote never seemed to get to
the comprehension of the masses. The only
objection is that it doesn’t give the third man
another show, which he ought to have about
once in a thousand times ; if the first ballot
doesn’t give anyone a definite majority of the
votes the first and second man have another
run for it, and the third man doesn’t. Now,
the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth men may all
represent one party—the strongest party of
the three, and if it -was compelled to concen-
trate its votes on the third man by knocking
the fourth, fifth, and sixth off the list, it might
utterly extinguish the first two. As it is, the
Second Ballot doesn’t give it a chance to assert
itself. At last N.S.W. election, however,
despite the multiplicity of candidates, there
were only two cases out of 125 where the Second
Ballot system could possibly have gone wrong,
and in both of these the possibility was of the
smallest, so it may be regarded as perfect
enough for all ordinary purposes.
Now that four out of the six provinces of Aus-
tralia and Tasmania have adopted the Federa-
tion Bill, and a fifth one has practically
done so, there is very little left to wait
for, as Westralia shows no signs of moving
in the matter. But, as usual, New South
Wales blocks the way. Premier Turner, of
Victoria, suggested that the election of dele-
gates to the Convention which is to draft a
Federal Constitution should be held next Feb-
ruary. This would give five months for more
serious pondering over a matter which has
already been talked and written and dreamed
of for years, and, as the only thing to be con-
sidered at present is which delegates shall be
elected, five months ought to be more than
sufficient. Premier Reid’s answer, after a fort-
night’s delay, consisted of one sentence : “I
think it too soon to attempt to fix the date of
the Federal election yet,” so the matter is to all
appearance hung up indefinitely. Why
it is too soon to fix a date, or when will be
a good time to fix a date, doesn’t appear. The
N.S.W. Parliament wasn’t consulted in the
matter ; Premier Reid simply refuses, on his
own sole authority, to move at present, or to
say when he will move, or to say when he will
be ready to say he will move, and the weary
old problem drops once more.
As one of thousands, Longmore, M.P. (Vic.),
recognises that the nature of land-tenure has
much to do with the success of the railways.
The other day he brought forward a motion in
Vic. Assembly to provide for the compulsory
sale of portions of large estates, the idea being
that the resulting subdivision would be accom-
panied by cultivation. Farmers bring more
traffic to the railways than squatters :
The railways would pay well if people were settled along
the lines. All the revenue received by the railways from
35 railway-stations in the midst of the large estates, on the
richest land in the colony, was £43,000 a year, whereas
from 24 stations where farmers were settled the revenue
for a year was £70,632.
There is an unfortunate hiatus in Longmore’s
well-meant scheme. It might break up some
big estates, bub unless there is a limit to
the amount of land which one person can
hold, or a tax system which makes big
estates unprofitable, there is nothing to
prevent new ones being constantly accumu-
lated. The graduated land-tax (self-assessed
with Government right to resume at a per-
centage above the assessment) must eat steadily
into the patience of the land-shepherd ; but
there is another expedient worth atrial. This
is a provision limiting the size of an* estate that
can be willed to any one person. The vulgar
desire to “ found a family ” —to build up the
Smith estate and leave it to Montmorenci
Smith, the eldest son—is already one of the
lusts of squatterdom. In Victoria there are at
present 70 estates of more than 20,000 acres.
Twenty owners hold between 30,000 and
40,000-acres each; ten hold between 40,000 aiul
50,000 acres; eleven hold more than 50,000
acres ; three hold more than 100,000 acres ! If
the law made it impossible for any one person
to receive more than 20,000 acres by inherit-
ance much good would be done in a single
generation. If the limit were made 10,000
acres the good done would be greater.

Queensland’s Railway Commissioner appears
to have a clear perception of what is meant by
the Betterment principle on land-resumption
affairs. He lately, under Parliamentary
powers, resumed several blocks of alienated
country for the projected Bundaberg railway-
line, and notified the owners that they were
invited to send in claims for compensation. In
came a host of claims, as may be expected, the
most modest striking a figure quite up to the
standard of landlord conception of what is just.
The Commissioner, however, sent each of them
a postal note for, in almost all cases, one
shilling, informed them that the railway was
itself a full set-off against the damage done,
and told them they can go to arbitration or
law, if they like to risk the penalties of losing.

and of his legal rights to-day and answer .•

At the inquiry into the death of a cycle-accident
victim at Sydney, last week, the jurymen
found a verdict of accidental death; this,
however, did not please the Coroner, who urged
them to re-consider their verdict. The jury
(though the sole judges) weakly did so, and
in the end announced that they were unable to
agree. Following this came the inevitable
“scene” with the attorney of the person in
custody charged with causing the death of de-
ceased. Under the present law the Coroner, on
the jury finding a verdict of murder or man-
slaughter, has power to commit for trial the
person suspected of causing the death. Origi-
nally it was not so, and the delinquent had to
be charged before the Police Court. Parlia-
ment, in conferring this jurisdiction on the
Coroner, and in failing to secure to an accused
the right to be represented in the Coroner’s
Court by his legal adviser, committed a grave
error. The privilege of being represented by a
lawyer now depends upon the state of the
Coroner’s digestion. Legal practitioners do
appear in the Sydney Coroner’s Court; but the
treatment to which they are there subjected is
a matter of concern, in this case at least, to the
public at large. Should any difficulty arise
during the enquiry, the Coroner easily gets
over it by majestically (and correctly) inform-
ing the unfortunate limb of the law' that he is
only there on sufferance, and that he (the
Coroner) is “master here.” No man charged
with an offence (and especially an offence for
which he may ultimately be hanged, or go to
gaol for 15 years or so) should be deprived of
legal assistance if he wishes it. Now that the
Coroner’s Court can commit a man for trial, it
is surely time to see that the holder of the
office of Coroner has some knowledge of the
criminal law, and that persons in custody before
him should be able, as of right, to insist on
audience being granted to their legal represen-
tatives.
Judge Stephen (N.S.W.) —and it appears that
he has privately obtained the concurrence of
Chief Justice Harley—has ruled that news-
paper proprietors can only safely publish that
portion of any law proceedings which is uttered
in the hearing of the open court, and cannot
safely transfer into print any portion of an
“ information ” or other document that is not
read in open court. This should be good for
reporters. The present vogue of employing
cheap boy-reporters—and of making the cheap
boy do the work of three men—is largely
responsible for the loose manner in which
police-court and law-court proceedings are pre-
sented to the public. The boy (like the big-
fee’d barrister who has- several briefs in several
courts at once) scrambles around as best he
may ; copies from official documents, gets
“results” from the official sources, and runs
them into as sensational “ copy ” as his willing,
but untrained, intelligence is able to evolve.
Many of the so-called “reports” are of cases
which the “reporter” has not himself heard.
If this latest judgment of N.S.W. Supreme
Court is to bear fruit, the “great” dailies will
actually have to send a real man to each court)
and where the next cutting-down in expenses is
to be made should be puzzling the judgment of
some “sweating” managers. The day of the
“penny-a-liner” —often utterly untrustworthy
—appears to have arrived for Sydney.
A self-alleged Turk, signing his name as
Mohammed Abdul Hagg (and whose literary
style in places smacks of Bill Smith), writes
to a Melb. journal excusing the recent massacres
of Armenians in Constantinople. “ The Sultan
of Turkey,” he says, “ is but an instrument in
the keeping of the Great God. Islam believes
in Him—God, the only God, who begetteth
Himself not, neither is He begotten, and there
are none like unto Him. God speed the de-
struction of the enemies of Truth ! The Hypo-
crites shall die by the sword of Islam,” &c. &c.
At present it seems probable that the Moham-
medan friends of Truth will die by the sword
of the Hypocrites, but this is outside of the
question. Mahomet, on his own showing, was
merely a restorer of Christianity, a revivalist,
the General Booth of his day. He was dis-
posed to preach Christ until it suited him to
preach Mahomet instead, even as it would have
suited the Gen’ral sixteen centuries ago to set
up Booth as the boss Prophet. Islamism is
rooted in Christianity, which sprang from
Buddhism, and the supposed truth in all three
faiths is much about the same. Consequently,
Turkish antipathy to the Armenians is really a
personal matter professing to be a religious Con-
viction, and, in point of fact, the Turk who
slaughters Christians for their hypocrisy in fits
and starts is himself a miserable hypocrite
whenever he ceases from slaughtering them.
Therefore, on the presumption that an ever-
lasting war against hypocrites is part of Ma-
homet’s teaching (which it isn’t,.not exactly),
the Turks ought to wipe themselves out with
one accord. And that’s about hs far into the
Eastern Question as the present writer can see.

The old seedy story of the Boer war, on
which so many horse and gore dramas have been
built, is dished up again in Bland Holt’s latest
production, “ For England.” Said Boer story is
becoming very tired and ancient, and the way 'it is
habitually distorted makes any right-thinking
person long to kick the British dramatist right
over the universe into Chaos. The main facts of
that unpleasantness were that the Boer, with
heavy odds against him, licked the Briton with
unfeeling regularity wherever they met, out-
generaled him, outfought him, wiped up the veldt
and the kloof and the karroo and the spruit with
him, took his flag in an off-hand fashion, captured
him, and treated him well in a gruff, morose sort
of way after he was captured, and fed him
abundantly on beef that gave him indigestion for
ever afterwards. And ever since then the Briton
has been writing horrible dramas in which he licks
the Boer in battles that never took place, and the
Boer is always ten to one, and when the noble
Briton is captured his brutal Butch enemy gener-
ally hangs him, or jumps on him with his large
cowhide boots, or drags his women-folk round by
the ear. The Dutchman always wins through
treachery, and he is almost always a low, dirty
character with pigs in his front parlor. This sort
of literature is described in the testimonial which
J. Bull habitually presents to himself after he has
won the battle that didn’t happen, and achieved
the great victory where he was licked, as “ British
fair-play,” and it is one cause of J. Bull’s wide
popularity.
* * *
“ For England ” is a badly-constructed
military howl with no plot worth mentioning, and
no visible motive, and a general want of connec-
tion and coherence, and almost everything else
that a drama ought to have, except scenery.
It is a series of weak, staggery impossi-
bilities, and there is only one character in
it who arouses the slightest interest—the kindly
Jew money-lender (Bland Holt) who charges
50 per shent as a matter of “ bithnith ” but seldom
collects it because the big heart under his veskit
won’t allow him to oppress anybody. The fact
that this wildly-grotesque Hebrew goes to the war
quite needlessly and disguises himself as a Zulu,
and does deeds of valour through his nose when he
ought to be at home looking after little Berijy and
the monish, doesn’t make him any the less a plea-
sant individual to meet, if it were possible to meet
such an individual. He is almost the only agree-
able _ stage Jew on record, and he is the only
British individual in this lamentable show who
doesn’t talk with dreadful iteration about “the
Flag, . and state at short intervals that Hingland
will rise. up presently and wipe out the Afrikan-
ders straight off. Baker is especially oppressive
in the matter of the Flag. Even in the peaceful
first act, when he gets on a horse with great diffi-
culty in order that he and a dozen other men and
two dozen dogs may run after one animal that is
too small to retaliate, he laboriously bumps a
loyal speech out of himself while holding on
m a pallid fashion to the roof of his animal,
and cheers for the Queen. Norman, as the
villain of the play, is reasonably convincing
except where he states, with the British troops in
the next room, that he is going to join the Boers,
and where he throws the white-haired father over
a precipice—the white-haired father obviously
going down a rope, and where he fools away his
chances to kill Baker, and otherwise makes an ass
of himself. Cosgrove, Montgomery, and Misses
Watson and I ranees Ross are redeeming features
in the dreary play. A duel on horseback (Boer
killed, of course), and a fox-hunt, where the
riders career madly over fences and down a six-
foot drop, and manager Simonsen distinguishes
himself as the maddest and most hatless horseman
m the crowd, and the tender-hearted Jew is im-
paled on a tree and left there, are also commend-
able bits of thrill and color. Otherwise the drama
seems to revolve mostly round Miss Virgie
Vivienne, as the daughter who has gone to the
bad m the old, monotonous way; yet that lady
only appears for ten minutes to state that she has
come back, and to faint once or twice and be
shaken by her father, and after that she seems to
faint right out of the narrative.

Nat Goodwin’s co. ran “In Mizzoura ” all
last week to very moderate business, which fact
further depreciates this paper’s previously low
opinion of its fellow-creatures. On its merits, the
’Murkan drama should go for eight weeks or more
to immense business, instead of which it is to give
place, after a fortnight’s precarious existence, to
the “Rivals.” Yet “Mizzoura” is one of the
finest dramas ever presented in Sydney— The Bul-
letin wouldn’t even like to say for ‘certain that
the “ Silver King ’’ is its superior—and it is played
so well that it is difficult to suggest how it could
be done better. Also, it is a picture of an entirely
new kind of life; it gets away from the sad
monotony of the British flag, and the Derby,
and the British officer, and the outcast heroirfe
starving in the streets of London, and the British
Soliceman, and the comic Irishman, and the funny
ew, and the Cockney with his pint of four’arf, and
the costermonger, and the green lanes of England,
and all the other time-worn props and circum-
stances. Possibly, however, the real trouble is
that the conservative Australian doesn’t want to
escape from the old groove, and it is the absence
of all the threadbare stage drivels that makes him
keep away to a certain extent, and he can’t stand
the brain-worry of taking in an entirely new set of
ideas. Nat Goodwin’s sheriff is about the best
stage hero within this paper’s knowledge, but the
trouble of trying to remember that a sheriff in

Next Wednesday a matinee benefit is to be
given at Sydney Lyceum in aid of the three child-
ren of the late Frank Cates, the Lyceum, Cri-
erion, Royal, Tivoli, and Majesty’s companies all
earing a hand., Cates, it is almost needless to
say, left his family wholly unprovided for. Even
apart from the fact'that illness compelled his dis-
appearance from the stage long before his death,
u®., n .®7®r possessed the melancholy virtue of
tnrilt, and he hadn’t the hard, square, wooden
countenance of one who accumulates loot. Every-
body who looked at Cates’s face could have set him
down as a man who would probably die penniless,
and he did. He drifted through life in his own
pleasant, unpractical way, and took things as they
came, when they came at all, which, in his latter
years, was but seldom. Therefore, the harmless
necessary ben.” follows as a matter of course.

“Mrs. Ponderbury’s Past” is due on Satur-
day night at Sydney Criterion. Burnand, of
London Punch, is the author of this new outbreak,
and as it has met with considerable success in
London it probably contains most of the things
which the author successfully omitted from his
mournful publication.

The cinematograph continues to be the
principal source of boom at the Tivoli. Sydney is
gradually going mad over this new invention, and
the signs are that the cinematograph is going to
rage virulently for a time. What is badly wanted
now is some device whereby the machine can be
connected with the telegraph and made to repre-
sent events while they happen, so that the public
can sit in a theatre on Cup Day, and see the race
m spectral guise on a white background as it pro-
gresses. This improvement is bound to come
along sooner or later, and when it does the
’graph will have a great future before it.
** * *
“Tommy Atkins,” the big, brass-banded
drama at Melb. Royal, is a hot and peppery affair
which threatens to excite a new thirst for gore.
It contains more corpses on stretchers and a larger
number of bandaged wounds than any other war-
like spectacle within Bulletin recollection. If
the excitement flags for a moment towards the end
and it doesn’t flag often—the army fills in time
by bringing forth its dead ’uns from the ambulance
waggons and making funeral processions across
the stage. Of three principal ladies, one (Miss
Maud Williamson) gets murdered in the first act,
and the other two live through a long stretch of
years to become red-cross nurses in a blood-stained
fortress. Fortunately they attain happiness at
the finish, when a regiment of gallant “ British
bulldogs ’’ comes to the relief of the indestructible
Royal Irish, and the nurses are seen dancing a
Tommy Atkins jig with the officers amidst the
heaps of slain.
♦ * * *
Perhaps there is somewhat too much name-
tune in the plot. At one time the brass-band
marches into church playing “Tommy Atkins,”
but, considering that the preacher for the occasion
is a hardened old hypocrite who supplies the army
with brown-paper boots and tin bayonets, it is
quite possible that the Lord doesn’t mind. The
relief-party travels to the tune of “Tommy Atkins,”
and at the villain s intended wedding, ten years
earlier, the same wind instruments had blurted out
the same old tune, probably because it was the
only one they could blow. So The Bulletin rises
to remark, by the way, that “ Tommy Atkins ” in
the form of a melody isn’t more than five years old.
Nevertheless, the drama is strong enough to
triumph over such a small anachronism. It wafts
an odor of barracks, Protestant religion, human
fragments and gilnpowder across the footlights,
and but for introducing a bathetic drummer-boy
who weeps for a dear dead daddy, it would be
beyond reproach as melodramas go. The army
provides employment for some 40 or 50 supers, and
these, by careful stage management, are multi-
plied until the eye, sated with gaudy apparel, turns
to the black-coated civilians in the audience for
relief.
* * • *
Plimmer, as the curate-hero, opens in the
black coat of a blameless life, but presently
abandons the Church in disgust, and fights for
glory at 2d. a day. A career of general insub-
ordination lands Plimmer on top of his superior
officer, who had undertaken to sell the fortress for
<£20,000 and a pint of water, after which the hero
picks up a blazing bombshell, and hurls it back at
the enemy with great slaughter. Plimmer is a
complete success. Diver plays the wicked majah in
a series of satisfactory snaps and scowls, and J. G.
Patten, as a remorseful myrmidon, worries through
a lot of difficult acting with an ability that he
hasn’t shown before. Miss Emily Hughes ranges
from first-class to medium as a wronged heroine
also Hans Phillips, Miss Watts Phillips, and the
festive Sweeney do some thriving comedy busi-
ness among them. In fact, Sweeney’s rich
brogue and taste for liquor are the most popular
features of the drama, next to the scenery and the
brass band. “ Tommy Atkins ” contains a dozen
clever scenes, including such a realistic interior of
a church that sinners in front feel truly grateful
when the curtain falls before anyone' has come
round to take up a collection.
** * *
At Melb. Princess’s the last nights of
“ Chinatown ” are being boomed by a new edition
of Miss Bessie Clayton, whose back-kick was the
backbone of the show’s success in the first
instance. Miss Bessie’s latest attraction is an
elaborate copy of the Loie Fuller fire-dance, and
it ought to enjoy the patronage of the Cremation
Society. After going through a course of eerie
limeht manoeuvres on a very darkened stage, the
damsel feigns to reduce herself to ashes in imagin-
ary flames. Bending over a thick sheet of glass
fixed into a trap opening into the floor, she waves
a jagged cloth in the reflection from colored fire
Mow, and thereby produces a flamey effect into
which she eventually collapses with a small
shriek. It is quite a convincing delusion, and
Bessie would be regarded as one gone for ever if
she didn’t return, after the lights had been turned
up, to smite her golden hair with her ankle as of
yore. La Femme de Feu dance will serve as a
smart fillip to “Chinatown ” business until “The
Milk White Flag ” comes along on Oct. 10.

The electric trapeze sisters and other
human attractions at Melb. Opera House were
reinforced on Saturday night by some more
Cinematographe. The apparatus this time is
rather amateurishly handled, but several of the
n ® w pictures are catchy subjects, and two or three
old ones are welcomed back with a roar. Anyway
Rickards is bound to make the most of his
flourishing monopoly previous to the arrival of the
‘only authentic Cinematographe” (whatever
that may mean) from Sydney. The finish for the
Derby seems quite authentic enough to go on with.

Alfred Dampier, the only identity who has
contrived to keep the Alexandra open for a long
period, intends to try his luck again at the old
shop. Dampier’s season will start on Saturday
next (3rd) with the amended version of “ Robbery
Under Arms,” and a reasonable chance of dis-
covering that it has come to fill a long-felt want.
Success at the “Aleck ” is always a fitful matter,
which happens when least expected and gives the
charm of an awful uncertainty to management at
that broad, capacious building.
At Poverty Point.
I (The Relic case at Melb. Public Library has just been
enriched with an original pink satin dress circle pro-
gramme of Mrs. Coppin’s farewell benefit, Melb. Queen’s
Theatre, June 8, 1846, over 50 years ago. It is under the
patronage of the Resident Judge, and Bar Association.
The bill includes four pieces, and a quantity of dancing.
Mrs. Coppin takes four characters in one piece.
Madame Simonsen’s misfortunes pursued her to the end ;
no sooner did she get into something paying than she
died. Her classes at the Howard Conservatoire were
rapidly filling up. Next year she would have been the
most prosperous teacher in Melbourne. Ada Crossley
used to say that she owed all her early success to Madame
Simonsen’s tuition.
Trebelli unconcernedly did what precious few ladies

Melb : “ On a railway-station to-day I sat next a serious

ladies in the water ? Do they do that to make them
strong ? ’ ”
In Aug. Alfred Dampier received a note from the late

The Tasmanian operatic basso, Lempriere Pringle, has
been chosen by Mme. Albani to accompany her shortly on
a tour to the States. Pringle has progressed wonderfully
in his art, and is now in the front division of operatic
artists in Europe. On a previous trip to the States
Albani and Vanderveer Green were together, and sang
exquisitely in concert.
Beauty “ got on a tear ” in the front row of the Gover-
nor s box at a varietj’-show the other night. Not content
with a noisy recognition of the male performers, whom she
saluted by name, an expensively-dressed lady took excep-
tion to the legs of the female performers, and, after in-
forming the audience that she had a far better pair than
any of them, gracefully proceeded to demonstrate the fact
by displaying a couple of symmetrical legs over the front
of the box to the great admiration of all beholders. The
only attendants, a young lady box-opener and a boy of 12,
were absolutely helpless, and went about wringing their
hands and imploring aid. At last, after the circus had
run its length, the lady was induced to go out for another
drink, when she found herself in the grasp of a policeman.
Then followed a night in chokee and 20s. fine.
Melb. Anars of Sept. 18 prints as from “ our London
correspondent” some three inches of a recent Bulletin
interview with Dot Boucieault—almost word for word.

collar first-hand, and say whence, instead of dishing-up
three months afterwards via London backstairs.
George Coppin is wrong in thinking that Ebenezer
Ward, M.L.C., wasacting with him 40 years ago, and that

Scot Inglis left an office-stool in Connell Hogarth’s

ought to change place with a good manv clerks, who pine
upon office-stools. Not 5 per cent, of the born actors in

The Milk White Flag” will, anyway, be a handsome
and expensive spectacle, which “Trip to Chinatown ” cer-
tainly isn t. The Firm’s way of staging that class of show
is considerably in advance of American notions, and with
a clever manager like Mitchell to work up effects the
bread cast upon the waters is likely to come back before
many days.
~T he drollest thing in “Trip to Chinatown” is to hear

. tale goes that an actress, now “ restin'* - ” in-
sists upon being privately boxed when she condescends
to visit any theatre “on the never.” If demur is made
the goddess offers a £5O-note in payment, and gains her
point througn lack of change. The other night, a whisper
of her coming preceded her, and the treasurer lav in
waiting. The lady .arrived with the old bluff, and, to her
dismay, was obliged with £4B, cash down, and at last the
historic £5O-note changed hands. But she took out her
40 shillings -worth of private-box in remarks. This storv
sounds more correct in spirit than in truth. ,

The benefit craze will receive a check in Melb. when the
committee of the most recent begabit has time to nar-
rate its experiences. The net result of a concert in
aid of a professional lady was £4O odd, and the wrangle
turned on the ownership of this amount, about half of
which was claimed by one of the joint hon. treasurers for
a debt allegedly due to his (music) firm. The lady expos-
tulated, but the treas. was obdurate, and in the end what-
ever members of committee who were within cooey were
summoned to an emergency meeting, when the sec.’s
action was warmly denounced. During the storm the
voice of the white-vested Zox was heard to declare that
if a Jew dared to act in that fashion the whole place
would be down on him.” The lady deepened the intensitv
of the situation by an attack of hysterics. The male
members of committee flew to get stimulants. The lady
members burnt feathers and investigated the singer’s
fluffy hair, and satisfied themselves it was really her own
and not a wig. Ultimately the hon. treasurer relented'
and the object of the benefit—to provide the lady with
funds to go abroad to where an engagement awaited her
—was attained. Moral :No matter how benevolent your
intentions, never place yourself in a false position by
helping to promote a benefit to a debtor of your own.

A Melbourne lady arrested the other day
for wholesale thievery of door-mats, garden-chairs,
&c., set up the defence of hypnotism. She claimed
that she was under the influence of another lady,
who made her get up in the middle of the night’
and go out and steal immense quantities of door-
mats and other properties. The hypnotist, accord-
ing to the story, got all the profit of the trans-
action, and the hypnotised lady did the hard work,
and humped the loot home, and provided the
storage. Business had been so active that at the
time of the arrest there was hardly a door-mat
left in Prahran, South Yarra, or Windsor. In
addition to robbing her of her rest, the
prisoner explained, she was robbed of her peace
of mind ; she was compelled to think of
door - mats all day and dream of them all
night. When the detectives arrived she was under
orders to go out and steal a new jacket for the
other woman, but her arrest saved her from this
new disaster. The police reckon that they have
found some stolen property on the other woman’s
premises, but their sordid theory is that the door-
mat collector is a lunatic, and that she threw the
goods in at the other woman’s window during her
absence and then went away to laugh an insane
laugh behind the water-tank.

The N.S.W. State Bank scheme, of which so
much was expected, has dropped down dead. The Reid
Govt, weakened miserably at the last, and the Bill intro-
duced to Parliament is a very different thing - from what
it was announced to be. It provides for the amalgama-
tion of the two savings banks, reduces the maximum rate
of interest to 4 per cent..—and otherwise leaves things
very much as they are. There is to be no State note-
issue as promised ; the new bank will not be the sole
bank of issue in the province as the Govt, declared it
would be ; it will not do ordinary deposit business, so
that the public can have a safe place to keep its current
account without being reconstructed ; there is nothing
about the State bank keeping the Govt, account and
doing the Govt, financial work ; there is no idea of run-
ning a State Land Bank business —in short, the whole
democratic aspect of the measure is gone utterly. The
new combined bank won’t interfere with the private
banking monopoly in any way ; in fact, by reducing the
maximum rate of interest it will help to drive business to
the private institutions when rates go up again. And
the paper currency of N.S.W. will still consist of the
I O U’s of certain private speculators without endorse-
ment, just as heretofore. The measure is much approved
of in financial circles for its “ moderation,” and it is
moderate—so much so that things might as well be left
where they are.
• * « *
The present mournful state of Vic. law as
regards companies and directors is illustrated by the
proceedings in the City of Melbourne Bank trial. Three
issues are submitted to the jury: (1) Were the last two
balance-sheets false ? (2) Did the directors and auditors
concur in publishing them, knowing them to be false ? (3)
Did they so concur with intent to deceive? In any decent
community living under a decent legal system that third
question would be absolutely unnecessary, and it merely
offers a big loophole for escape. If it is proved that a
balance-sheet was false and that certain persons con-
curred in issuing it knowing it to be false, then it is pure
absurdity to ask if they issued the false balance-sheet
with intent to deceive. There is no other purpose for
which it could be issued ; nobody in his senses imagines
that it was issued with intent to be a fender or a front
gate. The same system applies to no other kind of
accused person ; the homicide, for instance, if it is proved
that he wilfully killed a man, is never let off on the
ground that it isn’t proved that he killed him with a view
to his being dead, and if a man wilfully steers a ship on
the rocks, no one asks for proof that he did so for the
purpose of wreoking the ship. These things are simply
taken for granted, and if anybody knowingly . issues a
bogus balance-sheet the fact that he did so with intent to
deceive should also be taken for granted. Anyhow, if the
fact that it is knowingly issued isn’t proof of the inten-
tion to deceive, then that intention can’t be proved, and
by inserting this question the Crown practically makes a
conviction impossible on any logical basis. If the wilful
deception doesn’t prove the intent to deceive then what
can prove it ?
The second question—as to the knowledge of
the falsity of the document—is also an example of how
the wind is tempered to the company director. He can’t
be got at for issuing a fraudulent sheet if he does it by
sheer neglect of duty or carelessness or incompetence,
but only if he issues it wilfully and knowingly. Yet the
man who runs his ship on shore, or drives his train past
a danger-signal and makes a collision, or the one who
negligently runs down somebody in the street is held
liable even though he didn’t do it wilfully and knowingly;
the mere fact that he undertook a duty and failed to do it,
with grave results to other people, is sufficient to bring
him into trouble. The same law ought to be good enough
for the director and auditor, but apparently it isn’t.
These two are about the only men in the community who
can undertake a most serious duty, and say they have
done it, and take their salaries under the false pretence
of doing it, and vet leave it undone to the ruin of other
people with absolute impunity so long as they can con-
vince a jury that it was only neglect or stupidity or lazi-
ness or callous disregard of other people’s interests that
was the matter with them.
* * * *
It is alleged that one inoreor less unimportant life-
office is stopping the exodus of its policy-holders by the
simple and efficient process of refusing to pay them any
surrender-values on their policies. Query : What is the
legal position of a policy-holder as regards surrender
values, or has he no legal position whatever? Every
office that Tub Bulletin knows of states that it grants
loans on the surrender value of its policies. That implies,
of course, that there is a surrender value, but apparently
the offices can fix it at any amount they please, and pay it
or refuse to pay it as they please, and do as they darned
well please ali round. If the law can’t accurately and
satisfactorily define the position of the policy-holder in
private offices, so much the more reason for establishing a
State Insurance Office, where the position will be defined.
Meanwhile, the man who wants to give up his policy had
better begin by inquiring (in writing) how much the
society will lend him on it at 8 per cent. If it offers (in
writing) a maximum of £9O then he can reckon the sur-
render value at £lOO, and it is no good for the society to
tell him afterwards, when it finds that he is leaving, that
it is only £35.

Even with the reduced rate of interest on private
loans of which so much has been heard, there is evidently
abundant room for the State Loan Department to do good
work in Maoriland. For the year ended 31st March the
private mortgages effected amounted to £5,573,790. Of
this the interest on £4,719,989 was specified. Loans above
5 per cent, amounted to £3,513,551; loans above 6 per
cent, were £1,652,093, and £1,266,957 was lent at from 7
to 62)4 per cent. As for the £850,000 odd on which the
rate of interest wasn't specified, the possibilities which
they cover in the matter of extortion are almost un-
limited.

That prosperous concern, the Civil Service Co-
operative Society (Sydney), shows a profit of £3275 for the
half-year ended 31st July. Shareholders receive a divi-
dend of 10 per cent, and a discount of 10 per cent, on
cash purchases and 3£ per cent, on monthly accounts.
There are remarkably few monthly accounts ; 10'per cent,
discount is a solid inducement to pay cash, and bad debts
are nil.

Evidence of T. A. Hills, vice-president of Vic.
Society of Accountants and Auditors, before the Banking
Commission “In case of large institutions, one auditor
should be a Govt, nominee. The shareholders were prac-
tically controlled by the directors in the appointment of
auditors, and therefore it is desirable that one of them
should be free and independent.” Yes, and both of them.
In nine companies out of ten the directors, by their own
votes, the votes of their friends, and the proxies which
shareholders send along to them in a casual fashion, can
appoint the auditors absolutely. Therefore, if there is
anything to conceal, they appoint auditors who won’t say
anything about it, and the auditors, being human,
thoroughly understand that they are paid for not doing
their duty, and don’t do it accordingly. When there is
nothing to conceal, it isn’t necessary to pull the wires,
and then the private-audit system is beautifully free and
independent; it acts all right when it isn’t wanted.
Auckland (M.L.) is thinking seriously of giv-
ing two private speculators a thirty-years’ monopoly of its
tramway system with a possible renewal for another ten
years. Auckland will be a big city when 40 years are
over, and will probably have put in 39 years’ hard cursing
at the aldermen who fooled away such a splendid oppor-
tunity of establishing a municipal^service.

The Bulletin receives from the Council Clerk
*of Moruya (N.S.W.) a letter complaining of certain re-
marks about the municipal finances in its issue of 22nd
Aug. He says that “ the person supplying same must be
entirely ignorant of the affairs of the town,” and adds
that the balance-sheet was not made public till Aug. 28,
which means presumably that this paper couldn’t have
had it on the 22nd. He also encloses a manuscript
balance-sheet of a much more solvent kind than the one
commented on. To which this paper can merely reply
that the remarks objected to were written m the office,
and based on what purported to be the printed balance-
sheet of the municipality, the same being apparently cut
out of a newspaper with a common pair of scissors about
six inches long. If the document in question wasn t
authentic or shouldn’t have been in the paper, The Bun-
LETiN can only disclaim all responsibility and ask in a
grieved tone of voice how it got there?
# * * *
Under the Municipalities Act it is pro-
vided that municipalities may borrow money for per-
manent improvements to the extent of not more than
five years’ revenue, provided that the Governor s consent
is obtained in writing, and 14 days’ notice is given by
advt. in the local paper of the intention to borrow, the
amount of the loan, the purpose of it, rate of interest,
security to be given, &c. The municipalities pay very
little attention to this law—some of them have nearly
double the amount of debt authorised by law ; and, in-
stead of the law-breaking aldermen being fined, as pro-
vided by the Act, the Government simply passes an Act
every now and then to legalise the unlawful loans that
have accumulated up to date. A Bill now on hand gives
authority to whitewash all such loans now on hand, ex-
cept that of the borough of Lambton. Lambton is the
insolvent township which borrowed £7OOO from the Com-
mercial Bank of Australia and refused to pay up on the
ground that the loan was illegal through the fault of the
aldermen, and therefore the bank must suffer. Apart
from the law of the case, which may be all right, how does
the moral aspect of it stand ? If the whitewashing prin-
ciple is right, why not whitewash all round ? And what
is the use of clause 190 of the Municipalities Act, any-
how?

Queensland railways are just now running at a
loss of a quarter of a million per annum. The Southern
line, pulled down by wretched little cockspur railways,
returns only £llBs. 7d. per cent. The Central line, how-
ever, from Rockhampton to Longreach, is probably one
of the best paying lines in the world of any great extent,
and brings in £6 4s. 7d. on capital invested. That king
of Australian railways, the Northern line, returns £8 6s.
per cent., but these handsome figures are sadly dis-
counted by some of the coast lines, whjch rarely average
more than 1 or 2 per cent, per annum.

Melbourne’s mine-directing community utters a
plaintive cry re the “ wilful folly ” of the banks in refusing
cash accommodation upon the security of mining-plant,
&c. The wailers contend that the loans they offer 8 per
cent, for would be less risky than the average mercantile
bill, which is discounted at 3b and they quote some
apparently remarkable instances of banks refusing to
advance, say, a hundred pounds, where the security
offered would fetch £lOOO at auction. Furthermore,
the rejected applicants support their complaint that
bank-managers nowadays are babbling idiots with a state-
ment that the City of Melbourne and the Commercial did
a large mining-advance business before the crisis, and
never lost a shilling by it. The Commercial, seemingly,
would expect to lose a shilling or two if it did the same
thing now, and the City of Melbourne is—well, in Queer-
st. The band of mining-directors had better start their
own bank and cease tearing at their golden locks. There
is “ millions,” by their showing, in a well-managed
mining-bank. The Mining Bank of Australia !

The course of the market in Junction stock has
only to a comparatively small extent been lately governed
by mining developments. The development of the 700 ft.
body has been slow, on account of the heavy water-
supply, but towards the north (in the direction of the
Junction North, that is) the faces are exceedingly fine. A
slump was due to certain alleged troubles of a firm with
which the co. has had dealings.
The British has not been so active since the days
when general-manager Patton was preparing for the smash
which presently came. The whole of the milling-plant
has been put in operation, partly on carbonates and partly
on sulphides, and is running more smoothly than any new
plant hitherto erected to deal with this class of ore.
Capt. Hancock, the veteran manager of Moonta, S. A.,
upon whose designs this plant was built, was some time
back relieved of half his duties at the copper-mine in order
that he might pay more attention to sulphide treatment.
The latest sulphide-process patentee is Kohler,
metallurgist to the 8.11. Proprietary.
South (8.H.) faces are big, but still hard.
Some remarkably massive bodies of ore have
been exposed lately in Block 14, mostly, of course, sul-
phides, rich in both lead and silver, but, unfortunately,
rich also in zinc. ■ However, the developments of carbon-
ate ore are satisfactory, too ; and this and the fact that
the co. does most of its own ore-treating renders it un-
necessary to make so clean a separation by the jigs. Just
now a body of solid sulphides over 70ft. wide is being
blocked out at the 400 ft. level; but, so far, this is practi-
cally untouched, as the upper levels have been supplying
the mill. By the way, the cry for ore to be extracted
from the lower levels while exactly similar ore is available
nearer the surface is extremely stupid. The safe thing
obviously is to make the hole on top first—not under-
neath.

The crowd that for some inscrutable reason
called itself the Sulphide Co. having wisely decided to
wind up, the re-opening of those Barrier-district leases
has only proved that the last owners did the
in shutting down. The chances are with the next boom
some other fools will be found to re-open them. Despite
the frantic yell of the tipster who, week-in week-out,
advised “buy Sulphides,’’ paid-ups ultimately fell to
twopence, and the concern goes into liquidation.

The same doleful story all over the province. The writer

on private lands law a farce, and the owner has made his

equally fine thing for the Exploration Co. (the purchasers)
the future must be left to tell. “Jack” Roberts, the
capable mining man of Sydney D.T., has gone to examine
this and other Clarence River fields. It will be interest-
ing to see what he says of the amazingly rich mines un-
earthed in that district by the “shipping reporter” of the
Star, which now says it did not advise a rush to the field.
Anyhow, it caused one by its sensational exaggeration,
and has been deservedly cursed for it.

Mt. Malcolm (W.A.) has had a crushing “just

Nine-tenths of the news from W.A. is now
wired from and concerns the mines of Kalgoorlie. Poor
old Coolgardie is right out of it. Also, nine-tenths of that
sent from Kalgoorlie concerns the Great Boulder and
mines in the immediate vicinity. The wonderful “ belt ”
is not so long or wide as it was. It is feared that a few
of the 2000 leases of the district must be quite outside of
it. Pegging-out leases at Hannan’s only ceased when the
boom pegged out. Two mates arrived at Hannan’s when
there were over 100 new leases taken up on the Boulder
transformation. One decided to peg-out; the other that
it was sheer waste of money. They dissolved partner-
ship, and the man who had no faith in the boom lasting
left the field to try and find some gold before he pegged
out. As soon as the other had pegged one lease he met a
buyer who paid him £6OO even before the application was
made. He concluded that pegging “ wild cats” was good
business, and he pegged another £6OO worth. Altogether
heclearedsome £20,000 by thesale of “cats.” His old mate*
after prospecting many miles of distant country, found
the best show he had struck in two and a-half years, but
as it was not a patch mine he couldn’t live on it with a dolly.
It wanted money to put it in shape. A number of ex-
perts pronounced it a really fine thing, but the boom had
gone, and as nine-tenths of the men in W.A. are simply
boom-miners nothing could be done with it. The old
mate has now no faith in legitimate mining.

Little Dr. Simon, having invested largely in
Norseman, is an out-and-out advocate of the Esperance-
Coolgardie railway. Says it would have saved Govt, over
a million on water alone. Premier Forrest recently asked
where was the Norseman gold. Simon is credited (by the
wire) with replying that he would show him within six
months 122,0000 z. a month from his mines alone, which
have a working capital of £lOO,OOO to develop on a large
scale. In a few days we shall possibly learn that these
gold-figures represent a slight mistake of 120,0000 z.
Trouble has arisen about the Empress of Cool-
gardie mine. By the way, did not Zeb. Lane report on
this property? Plenty of machinery and stone; it only

“ An enormous supply of water has been struck
on a water-reserve held by the Great Boulder and Lake
View cos. ; and, so far, the pump has had no effect on the

quantity produced is not 10 per cent, of that announced
by newspapers. * * *
No more Gen. Gordon pups on the market.
With Extendeds (ss. paid) down to a humble bob the idea
is too horrible. The Gordon people, regarded as heroes a
few months ago, are now lying low, and for shame’s sake,
or in fear of instant death, are not bringing out any new
companies at present. ,
A Hannan's correspondent to The Bulletin
“The opening of the Kalgoorlie railway, on Bth Sept., was
a sick ceremonial. Many things contributed to the lack
of enthusiasm. The miners were annoyed, seeing that
the affair was only an excuse to grant a week’s exemp-
tion and keep them idle for seven days. The boomsters
and mining sharks feared the arrival of the iron-horse, as
they knew it was the death-knell of their old cry, ‘ Wait
till the railway comes and the mines get their machinery.
Than the crushing will astonish you.’ The railway has
come—the crushings have yet to come. The storekeepers
knew that the railway’s arrival meant, as it has done in
the East, the levelling of prices to bedrock, and the
» cutting ’ which grieveth so much the soul of the trafficker
—goodbye to the old 200 per cent, profits. No wonder,
therefore, that the train that brought Sir Jerry Smith and
all the Perth deadheads to this much-boomed town came
to a dead-stop at the apology for a railway-platform
amidst a painful, gloomsome silence. Not a soul cheered.
To make matters worse, the Gov. arrived at the wrong
spot. The reception-committee was not there to wel-
come His Ex., and the member for the district, who had
been completely ignored throughout, got more than even
with them, as he did all the welcoming. The only person
whom the mob saluted was a popular pressman. Not a
hat in the crowd was dotted, nor a single cheer raised, as
the Gov. drove away. The band rose to the occasion by
playing a dirgeful funeral march as the welcome to the
Queen's representative. The only reality about the pro-
ceedings was that it was real Hannan’s weather, the
willy-willies blowing violently all day long.”

Premier Forrest, at Kalgoorlie rail way-opening
guzzle : “Thank God, we are part of a great and mighty
Empire. He hoped they would never forget the borne of
their fathers, from which they derived not only their laws
but their liberties—in fact everything they most prized
came from the institutions and legislature of the great
country.” (Great applause.) “ Why not say “oof-bird”
and be done with it! When one man, or a combination
of men, manages to get out of Bull hundreds of thousands
of pounds for mines dear at live per cent, of their price,
as done in scores of instances in W.A., that country is
bound to burst with loyalty, and its big fish begin to
thank God for various things unconnected with the
boodling business.

The bad slump in Westralian stocks has knocked
the wind out of the boomers, and wind is their chief stock-
in-trade. However, it is consoling to hear that “ there is
nothing wrong with the mines ” : as witness the Great
Boulder and the few other gold-producers remaining at
many pounds, while the innumerable non-producers are
down to about the same number of 'pence: Boulders,
£7 10s. ; Boulder Central Extended, 2s. 3d. ; Boulder
Cons'ois, 3s. 6d.; Boulder 1-Mile South, Is. ; Boulder
Independent, Is. ; Boulder North-West, Is. ; etcetera.
How can there be anything wrong with the mines? Of
course the share-market is the ass, not the newspaper
people who talks like this !

Mr. Rodda, chairman of the presentation shivoo
to David O’Neil, ex-manager of the Lake View mine, at
Hannan’s : “ Our guest has not only helped this part of
the colony, but the whole of Westralia, out of a muddle.
Less than two years ago the Colony was being cried down
all over the world. The Great Boulder, now one of the
best mines of the world, was then known as a complete
duffer. There was not a single man who had any faith in
it.” Exactly, but there were some people who told a
great story about it, and they have come right out on top
while the men who told the truth about it, so far as it
was then known, are laughed at. The Great Boulder is
the great Dean case put in the shape of a mine.

come in from Westralia itself, and the public on this side
is following the lead which has been given them. The
crushing returns which are coming in are excellent, and
the list will soon be swelled by the figures of about twenty
companies whose machinery will be started within the
next few weeks.” Who inspires this sinful stuff ?

The aftermath of the recent W.A. boomlet:
Several >V.A. brokers could not weigh out when
their Adelaide drafts were presented. One man sent

this stock is due to the anxiety on the part of some bank
to get back its till-money.

better than the average Stein, Berg, and Vitch. The
Chow has a mortal terror of fire, and will live in safety in
the most ramshackle of buildings, built of the most in-
flammable materials, for half a century, paying his insur-
ance regularly. Never a fire will burn that place if he
sleeps on the premises. Admit the Christian, then liquor
and indifference will burn the place down in a week;
whilst with the other brigade, if the place is insured, it
is liable to burn down even if the nearest biped is 50

Gov. Hampden draws some fine distinc-
tions. For instance, H.E. would not patronise
the Eight Hours people on the ground that a bill
was pending to make the Eight Hour system
legal; but he has just entertained at his table a
gentleman whose present relations with the Attor-
ney-General in the latter’s official capacity are
much strained.

Gerard Smith, Gov. of Westralia, has
been suffering from swelled head, but has been
badly bumped about of late, and is in a fair way
to learn things he did not know before. “Jerry’s”
conception of the position of Governor—as evi-
denced by some remarks of his at a farewell
banquet in England—was that it resembled that
of the Czar on a small scale, and the fact that
Westralia possessed a Ministry which regarded
him as.a figurehead and nothing more filled him
with wonder and grief. For some time after his
“assumption of the Govt.” of W.A., Jerry was
content not to break anything, imagining in a
vague way that by-and-bye the Ministry would
ON YAREA’S BANKS.
1ST EX-DIRECTOR : “I see they’re going to reconstruct our tanks.”
2ND DITTO: “ Yes; life isn’t worth living now. Let’s go into liquidation. The
morgue’s close by.”
return to its senses and let him take a hand at
governing. At length he ventured to assert his
sovereign will, but the Ministry shoo’d him on one
side and went on as before.
Then the wrath of Jerry was great, and he
decided that it was time to commence to crack
things. It happened to be the week of the open-
ing of Kalgoorlie railway, when H.E. decided to
invest himself with a little of the majesty that
should hedge “ the representative of her most
Gracious Majesty.” Setting out from Perth,
H. Ex. called before him the station-master, who
had not provided a carriage for the vice-regal
menials, and when the official • refused • to tremble
swear-words, which afterwards appeared in print,
were heard on the morning air.
The vice-regal party had accepted the hospi-
tality of a Kalgoorlie magnate, who learned that
it would not be fitting for the representative of
H.M. to dine with a subject, and who thereupon
respected the Governor’s desire that lie should be
permitted to dine alone in state—except on one
occasion when dignity was relaxed and his Ex.
was graciously pleased to invite his host to partake,
in his own house, of his own provisions, and at his
own table, with his guest.
Which recalls an incident of long ago. Al-
though it is not meet that vice-royalty should
dine with a subject, there is nothing in the eti-
quette of courts to 1 say that' the king’s retinue
may not make off with a subject’s provisions.
An Australian Governor once stayed at the house
of one of his subjects on the occasion of a railway-
opening, and H.E.’s menials, at the conclusion of
the festivities, carefully gathered up all the tur-
keys, ducks, and other provender in the place
(this doubtless without their master’s knowledge
or consent') and made them tip into a hamper to
consume in the train. It happened that the enter-
tainer of vice-royalty, to celebrate the departure of
his guests, probably, had bidden friends to a feast.
The friends arrived when it was discovered tha
the vice-regal locusts had been-through the larder,
and they dined, sorrowing for the turkey that was
gone, on whatever they could scratch up.

The billets have numerous waiters,
The telegraph-poles have black paint round their

But the National Guard has no gaiters !

When sun, moon, and stars have collided,
When the dead from their muuldering sepulchres

And the sheep and the goats are divided ;
When blasphemous echoes are borne on the breeze
Near the lake where the Brimstone-Cook caters,
We may meet some old pilgrims hot pitch to the

Of mansions in the skies;
But fell from these and worshipped at
The shrine of her dark eyes.
And ere the lessons had been read
His soul had sunk from grace :
He knew that he would die to touch
Not heaven, but her soft face.
While white-robed choristers rolled forth
A paean fraught with praise,
Lifted love-shrouding lashes long
And met his burning gaze.
With lips we kiss, but love can look,

Then through that glance the “Amen” pealed

S.A. Register on Adelaide Hospital-

. . . too much to expect that the Premier will . . _ .
give an opportunity for discussion. . ’. Glaring unfair-
ness of Mr. Kingston . . . record of suppression of
the truth . . . honor,of South Australia tarnished. . .
Then this article winds, up in denunciation of
people who make political capital out of such
troubles ! The one certain thing about the Ade-
laide Hospital disputes is that no one impartial
enough to decide them could be found in Adelaide
—perhaps in all Australia, so far as medical men
are concerned.
Where will a row end with a woman in it ? The
Adelaide Hospital-squabbles began with the al-
leged injuries of nurse Graham. The hon. staff
demanded her dismissal; Kingston refused. The
former went on strike, and two doctors were im-
ported and a scratch staff enrolled. And now,
through another woman, the four house-surgeons
have struck, leaving a hospital full of patients to
three doctors, and necessitating doctors’ work be-
ing done by nurses and students. “The usual
woman ” is appalling enough, but two women ! !

A Bulletin correspondent :
Re hospital doctors. A friend of mine recently went to
a public hospital suffering from cancer of the tongue.
While he sat, two doctors stood by surrounded by gaping
medical students, before whom they coolly and at great
length discussed the method of sawing in two and laying
open the lower part of his face. He was operated on and
duly died, but didn’t mind that—it was the discussion
that hurt him. I have noticed a good deal of this kind of
thing from time to time. Don’t you think it is unspeak-
ably cruel to conduct such discussions in the presence of
the doomed ? People are more or less educated nowadays
and readily see the drift of even technical medical talk.

To such an extent does the public believe
in the quack, that of late there has been more
than one case of a thoroughly qualified man con-
cealing his diploma and practising in the guise of
a quack. A reversal with a vengeance of the ass
in the lion’s skin fable.

duty and 73b hours reserve duty, or a daily
average of 17 nours 8 mins, total duty, of which
13 hours is active. Also, twice a week married

Bananaland (contrary to popular notion) is
a remarkably healthy country. Many European
diseases are notably less virulent in the North
and North-West. The death-rate for last year,
10-8, was excelled only by Maoriland, which gave
9’91.

According to Registrar-General Blakeney,
phthisis is still the most fatal disease in the
North, causing 8.15 per cent, of total deaths
against 11 percent, in England and 16.2 per cent,
in. the States and Canada. Apropos the im-
munity of Jews from this disease is no doubt due
in great part to their care in selecting animals for
food. The children of Israel don’t eat lumpy-
jawed and tuberculous bullocks like the ignorant
Gentile. While the State regards the butcher’s
hideous crime of poisoning a score of families
with a diseased beast as fully expiated by a 40s.

retailer will continue to sow broadcast the seeds of
cancer and consumption at so much a pound.

A Ballarat Presby-

ing to popularise his
church, and insists that
“ clergymen should en-

moonshine is about
played out.

Last week a Sydney
city firm asked a regis-
try-office to supply them
with a light porter at a
miserable salary. When
they were suited they
advised the registry-
office keeper, yet appli-
cants continued to come.
One of the callers, asked
why he came when the
situation was filled, re-
plied that the registry-
man told him it was still
vacant, and that he had
paid 10s. for simply
being told of the va-
cancy. If he secured
the situation the 10s.
would be kept, but if
unsuccessful only ss.
would be charged. No
wonder the registry-
oftice manager kept
sending applicants after
the already-filled post,
when every such applicant paid him !
’ Premier Turner has disturbed the Vic.

vague things to happen if Turner persists.

The newly-appointed veterinary inspector
in four Melb. suburban districts reported that out
of 351 milk sources— i.e., cows—lie found 15 dis-
tinctly tuberculous, 9 affected with symptoms of
the disease, and 5 that were beginning to go
wrong. Moral: You drink unboiled milk at the
risk of your life—at the risk of slow, long-drawn
spitting out of your lungs, or of an equally deadly
and lingering joint-disease. The mother who
gives her children raw milk takes about one chance
in ten, as things are now regulated, of filling them

During Aug. 953 diseased animals were
condemned at the abattoirs, dairies, and other
places in N.S.W. And very likely seven times as
many passed (literally) into “ consumption.”

Melb. milk-vendors are urging on Vic.
Govt, the absolute necessity for removing dairies
from the lax control of municipal bodies, and
putting them under strict Government super-
vision. As showing how the municipalities
let things slide, the writer hereof knows of one
old beldame in Carlton, who inhabits a filthy,
one-roomed shanty adjoining her more filthy
cowshed, and built of old kerosene - tins and
bits of packing-case, and invariably sets the cans
of milk for cream under a crazy wooden bed,
whose coverings have apparently not seen soap for
half a century. The milk-vendors also petition
the Govt, to inflict a <£lo license oh them.

Apropos the complaint that offal-fed poultry
compete unfairly in the Sydney market against
grain-fed birds, a fact recorded some time ago is
worth rehashing. A Sydney poulterer visited a
Botany duck-farm and found the proprietor busy
skinning the carcase of a big Newfoundland dog,
which was hanging up by the heels. The carcases
of a number of other dogs, some of them diseased,
lay around. In reply to a query, the duck-farm
potentate explained that he got the dogs “ from
Sydney,” that he had a good market for the skins
of any that were not mangy, and that he fed the
carcases to the ducks. Hence, doubtless, some of
the fat “muscovy-mules” that you see in the
shops. Dog-fed duck ! Ugh ! By the way, there
appears to be no medical inspection of poultry in
N.S.W., and fowls often reek with tuberculosis.
What with Itontgen rays, nine experi-
ments with which in that town, for practical
surgical purposes, have up to date been successful,
scholastic activity manifesting itself in bull-baiting
Sydney University about its undemocratic Senate
laws, and the resolve to hold a Federal Conven-
tion of its own at an early date, Bathurst, the
City of the Plain, is proving that it is too go-ahead
a place for a Federal capital. This is just the
reverse of what Bathurst fondly hoped to prove.

But when I turned to make my peace,

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
. Sydney, Sept. 29, 1896.
Mr Dear Myek—
A vast audience, with Premier Reid in a large
leather chair all to himself in a front row, stood
three hours of assorted music nobly at the Kow-
alski benefit-concert. The only chance of moving
—for each was so closely wedged against his neigh-
bor that it was even hard to breathe—was when
Mayor Ives and the Premier, backed by a com-
mittee phalanx, presented purses of gold, illumi-
nated addresses, and other trifles to Kowalski,
who, choking back his emotion behind a minute
ball of handkerchief, thanked everybody in a few
very graceful words. A “foreigner,” in his
struggle to learn the language, generally much
enlarges his vocabulary; thus the speech of this
most marvellously mercurial of all Frenchmen
flowed much more fluently than that of the Mayor,
whose compliments were almost as awkward as
the historical atrocities not long ago addressed by
ex-Premier Dibbs to Mrs. Brough. Premier Reid’s
remarks atoned for all, and were a marvel of
good taste ; there is no one who can more adroitly
make a bouquet of the flowers of speech and spread
the jam above the butter. The pupils, in a be-
ribboned little pen, sobbed audibly and waved
handkerchiefs the while, and laid wreaths and
floral lyres at the patent-leather feet of the master.
Among the singers, pretty Hetty Holroyd, kindly
loaned for the evening by “ the Firm,” struck her
hearers most forcibly : her singing of “ The Twi-
light of Love ” immediately disclosed the fact that
there has arisen yet another Australian with a
world-reputation-making voice.
The Lyceum was crowded on Saturday after-
noon at a private view of the newly-imported
cinematographe, which affords an absolutely fas-
cinating entertainment. The possibilities of the
instrument as a depictor of dumb-show events are
marvellous —you could not be more interested in
the performers who do the clever “serpent’’and
hat-trick acts if you had the men before you in
the flesh. The pictures that caught on most were
the quarrelling babies—the changes of expression
on the crying child’s face were so natural that
every father in the audience longed for the patent
to enable him to produce that noiseless weep in
his own infant. Being a French invention, the
machine reserved another baby picture for the
crowning one—a breakfast scene, in which an
obviously Gallic pa and ma are gazing at their
child with that joy and delight which such a rare
bird as an infant always excites in a French
family. There is a wonderfully realistic tableau
where the audience sympathetically observed the
beer actually disappearing from the glasses down
the card-player’s throats. The marching soldiers,
however, lost much of their effect owing to the
absence of all color, showing that Tommy Atkins
derives no small part of his martial swagger from
his millinery. In all the views the illusion was
quite perfect,, except for an occasional quick
flutter that quivers over the sheet like an electric-
shock made visible.
( The cinematographe is certainly destined to
draw more closely the bonds.” By next year
we shall doubtless, see on the screen Queen Vic-
toria out for an airing and bowing right and left
to her loving subjects ; and her comfortable-look-
inff eldest son waving his hat in a similar spirit
and thereby demonstrating his hopeless baldness
to the world. Also Mr. Gladstone felling a tree,
while the faithful “ Catherine ” approaches bear-
ing for the refreshment of the G.O.M. whatever
is the English equivalent of a billy of tea. By the
way, how splendidly adapted to cinematographic
purposes would the forthcoming great Tasmanian
chopping-matches be !
Love runs in strange shapes and in all colors.
Even Tommy Malicolo feels chivalric to the papa-
damsel who essays to instruct him in religion.
A Kanaka retainer of a N.S.W. sugar-planting
family was taken to church by the daughter of the
house. It was his first service, but everything
went smoothly until the plate came round, when
Tommy, sitting at the end of the pew and seeing
those in front of him depositing threepennies in.
the dish, placed therein two. To his astonishment
the young lady in her turn dropped a coin “ on her
own.” Tommy whereupon clutched the deacon’s
arm excitedly with—“ Hey, mister, /pay for this;
] ady ! The untutored heathen doesn’t compli-
cate life s problem with civilised feelings of charit-
able compassion and the desire to snatch brands;
from the burning, but gets right down on the bed-
rock of instinct straightway. With him, if a
woman takes any interest in a man, white or
colored, it always means eventually “paying for
this lady.” A fact for the consideration of the
girls who burn to go and enlighten the poor'
Chinese.

,A Sydney woman has patented a cycling-skirt;
which she claims to be the perfect wear for wheel-
women. She compromises with Bloomers by
combining them with the skirt and placing them
inside, her object being to utterly abolish that any-
thmg but fascinating effect in a high wind, of twin
balloons on wheels. There is yet another device of
knickers and a sort of apron—a hybrid-looking
garment, unto the rider a stumbling-block and
unto the dismounted a foolishness. But all this'
gradual development seems to show that the
bikeress must come to undisguised bags in the long:

adorned with a cache-peiyne of roses of the now
aslnonable tmt. An osprey on the crown
heightened the barrier still further, and the brim
was elaborated with puffings of tulle. Probably
no A_-iay has yet been discovered powerful enough
to pierce the theatre hat. In answer to despairing
cries of Please take your hat off, Madame,”
the alleged lady turned a sphinx-like cheek and
tossed her plumes like a hearse-horse ; yet if she
ever went to the theatre-stalls, she would see
whole rows of women sitting hat-in-lap as soon as
the curtain goes up. If a woman really can’t re-
move her hat, it shows that her dress pinches
under the arms, or else that her bangs are artificial.
A vice-regal damsel, known as “the princess,”
while biking the other day in the vicinity of a
cab-stand m pa’s capital, parted from her steed
and descended to the ground not on her feet,
amidst a whirl of draperies which brought blushes
to the cheeks of the cab-horses. A male bystander,
unaware that the lady Was a vice-princess whom it
is sacrilege for a common person to touch, ran to
her assistance. He was not allowed to stand the
fallen dignitary on her feet, for as he approached
she exclaimed : “Go away ; if you were a gentle-
man you would not come near me at such a time.”
•I £ ou Were a lady y° u would not say that,”
said the young man, beating a hasty retreat.
Mrs. “Jack ” Barrett (wife of the Yic. doctor-
cricketer), recently deceased at Brighton, Eng-
land, was a daughter of Archibald Johnstone, a
pioneer Victorian squatter, and the last of three
sisters well-known in their day. Kate, the eldest,
was the first girl to appear on the Block in as
mannish a get-up as the police of the day would
allow—a monocle and short-cropped liair were
then the extremes. She was handsome and clever,
and her death from typhoid after a few days
illness was a shock—for Melbourne was fond of its
“boy-girl.” Another sister married David Lee,
the pugnacious city organist, and was reconciled
to her family, who opposed the match, only
shortly before her death. Their mother married
young Nicholas, brother of the conspicuous Clara
Parker, and was subjected to a mobbing every
day in Collins-street when she drove out with her
youthful and handsome hubby in a gold-mounted
carriage. It was Mrs. N. who dressed up a detec-
tive like an English Johnny and took him to the
races with her to guard her dress —trimmed with
£2OOO worth of diamonds.
“ A Dream of Eden ” is a passionate warble by
John Sandes, set to music by Henry Alan Reve,
and published by Allan and Co., Melb. The
words are distinctly lyrical, and the music_ carries
them along in an expressive, sympathetic manner.
Among the ghastliest of my stage memories was
a performance of “Still Waters Run Deep,” in
Adelaide, a year ago. The Dacres and Frank
Cates were in the cast —the Dacres with a pre-
sentiment of tragedy around them, which filtered
■out to the sparse, almost empty house ; and poor
Cates struggling with hemorrhage all the time. It
was shortly before Arthur Dacre gave up the
struggle in disgust; and now Cates is dead, leaving
his three children unprovided for. Mr. William-
son has lent Sydney Lyceum for a benefit on 7th
Oct., &nd, as the rest of the city manag’ers heartily
■co-operate, and are assisted by Mrs. Brough and a
ladies committee, a considerable sum should be
realised.
I hear it is a solemn fact that Westralia’s new
Governor, at Kalgoorlie railway-celebration, re-
fused point-blank to sit down at table with his
host and hostess, Mr. and Mrs. Geo. Gray, al-
though he captured their house, a perfect little
palace (a Kalgoorlie palace means a house with a
bath-room), and dwelt there a whole week. The
■only sports at the celebration, which was woefully
lacking in amusement, were held at the Boulder
and run by a son of Somers Vine, the Prince of
Wales’chum who carried the plate around Aus-
tralia for that hot-bed of colonial snobbery, the
Imperial Institute. Young Vine annexes most of
Ihe alphabet for himself, his initials being
•J.E.H.W.S.V. At the ball the “lydies” had a
very good time, and next morning one of them
showed an intense desire to sleep it off in the open
air in Hannan-street.
“’Totherside ” damsels who have been enabled
to enter upon their life-sentences of wedded bliss
■owing to their best young men going over to Wes-
tralia and making a rise, are now counted in such
numbers as go far to equalise the exodus of them
from the East. Eligible girls are in strong demand
■on the fields ; the difficulty is that so few of the
right sort go over. But when they do they are
snapped up forthwith, and occasionally a bargain
is struck by deputy. A young man from Victoria
who had made his pile wanted someone to share
it, and, having no best girl on hand just then,
proposed by letter to a friend, a goldfield official’s
daughter. She closed with the offer, went over
•and married him. In her new home she became a
great favorite, her tiny tent-parlor being crowded
every evening with guests. Once she casually
mentioned her sister. “Is your sister anything
like you?” asked an intrepid youth possessing
many thousands. “ Yes, a little.” “Then write
to her to come over and I’ll marry her if she’ll have
me.”_ Which was done, and they were married
and live very happily so far.
The rival cycling contests on Saturday were
worked up by their promoters so keenly that the
public flocked to both in large crowds. Although
the Sydney Bicycle Club sports on the Cricket
Ground were better attended, the League of
Wheelmen had a larger gate—as the Cricket
Ground members’ tickets allowed for so many
deadheads. The difference between the two
associations is that the League are amateur-profes-
sionals, and the Club are professional-amateurs.
Just as the Sunday Times pen-lady warns
women against marrying “bald men, poets,
drunkards, actors, authors, journalists and club
nien (it is hard to know exactly what deficiency
of income debars a man from club life, or at what
particular stage baldness blights a suitor’s hopes)
a correspondent suggestively forwards to me Prof.
Lewm s advice to a woman “always to select a
fat man as a life partner.” Sleek-headed men
really seem to be sought after as companions, and
the woman who likes to convert a man into a mere
nusband sets up for an ideal the fat-bookmaker-
with-a-buggy—which means sealskin, diamonds,
fast trotters, and the pleasure of passing, like a
streak of greased lightning, the slow shandrydans
m which the other woman jog-trots to Coogee. I
notice that the fat man is not in the Sunday
.Limes expurgatory index.
When Sydney Royal dress-circle makes up its
mind about its title-rdle, the effect will be much
smarter than it is. On Monday a few bare-shoul-
dered ones sat conspicuous among the mass of
every-day dresses and hats and crowds of school-
girls putting in the Michaelmas holidays by taking
s hpli n o SWor fh °f ini ported patriotism.
Ihe boded-sh irt bosom of one Melb. visitor shone
refulgent in the front row, but all other men were
iriiirti. There is a deal of death and glory in the
wru me f°d rs hi)a and a pretty gown or two.
Lhzabeth Watson touched high-water mark with
a white muslin and embroidered polonaise over
green silk and green silk sash. Her yellow
cape had a graceful droop, but wasn’t so
fetching as Miss Ross’s fascinating little bil-
lows of lace and pink roses, or a little
Watteau dress of Pompadour brocade, with fly-
away sleeves, worn by her in the plush or tapes-
tried halls of Cranbourne. Mrs. Bland Holt wore
quite killingly the coquettish bib and tucker of the
stage quakeress. Most of the men wore uniforms
and dirty faces ; when the villain remarked that
he had had a close shave, an observant audience
saw plainly that his chin hadn t. Cosgrove is
training to look like George Rignold in the figure,
and succeeding.
My Melb. correspondent writes
“ . r f'f le Law seems as asinine as ever, and the
galling remarks indulged in by Judges are as
vitriol in the wounds of sufferers. A victim in
point is the widow whose husband died intestate,
leaving about £6OO. She took out letters of ad-
ministration, a process which necessitates two
securities, each equal in value to the intestate
estate. W ith some little trouble guarantors were
found, one worth the required sum, the other good
for half. In poor farming districts moneyed men
are not found on every bush, and this was the best
that could be done. In vain the widow’s legal
adviser applied for permission to proceed, despite
the shortage in her pound of flesh. The Judge
said he could not see why the fatherless children
should risk loss through insufficient security, just
because their mother could not be troubled to
obtain proper guarantors. Meanwhile matters are
at a standstill, not a penny can be administered,
and the orphans seem likely to lack bread and
butter.
“School inarms begin to fight shy of Toorak.
Once it was the aim of every aspiring instructress
to establish herself there before she died. More
than one learned too late that the elect bestow
their ‘ distinguished patronage ’ in full payment of
school bills. Then, gilded pupils are generally
crassly stupid, and their indebted parents insolvent
beyond belief. One of Melbourne’s biggest
schools dwindled to nothing in no time just
because the long-suffering principal spoke her
mind for once and ‘ offended ’ Lady What’s-her-
name.
“First question asked by a she-visitor to the
House (Melb.) is : ‘Who’s the ’Arry ! 5 apropos
of the gilded Pursey Chirnside, with his hair
plastered low on his forehead, blue zebra-striped
shirt front and red neck-scarf, meandering waist-
ward. Unlike jovial Minister Taverner, the
Premier does not attract the feminine eye, owing
to over-meekness of mien, while Member Murray
is nick-named ‘ Burglar Bill,’ and Chairman
Mason sneered at as effeminate.
“ Women, as a class, have their own vague, mis-
leading ideas of local politicians, as reported by
the Argus. To such innocents as these a par-
liamentary debate comes as a surprise. Heard at
first hand, the labour - members are no more
bumptious and blatant than anyone else, and if
they tried could not be more spiteful and narking
than the sleek tall-hatted speakers, whose speeches
read so impressively in family morning papers.
Patriarch Longmore finds favor with the sparring
sex because ‘ he’s got such fire in him, and lets ’em
have it all round,’ and, like all his compatriots,
though all there in a fight, is lamb-like when
encountered off the field.
“ The soul-destroying influence of the bicycle is
making itself felt at Brunswick (Vic.), where the
churches have united to protest against the holding
of cycling ‘church parades,’ owing to the fact
that 70 per cent, of the Sunday-school children
‘ wagged it ’ on the occasion of the last parade for
the purpose of witnessing the exciting function.
The ‘ church parade ’ is ostensibly a godly gather-
ing of wheelmen and wheelwomen who ride en
masse to a certain bethel to hear a white-faced
man talk about hell. In reality it is an associa-
tion of lively youths and bloomered maidens who
ride as far as the church, and then ‘go off in
couples like the animals out of the Ark to look
for wattle blossom ’ according to picnic-precedent.
The church is filled with the usual congregation
and with a score of the promoters of the show,
who go in for shame’s sake. The average parade
consists of about 2000 cyclists, and the average
church where the service is held seats about 200.
“ Of 40 cyclists summoned to appear before the
District Court in one week for breaches of traffic
by-laws, only three (!) answered their names. The
remaining 37 were ‘not found at the address
given.’ Municipal councils will yet have to
invest their officers with authority to lock up
offending wheelmen on sight, or follow the Yankee
fashion of impounding the bike until satisfactory
bail is forthcoming.
“ London Sketch is utterly deluded by some
Melb. scribbler, who tells of the alleged way in
which knickers have knocked out skirts amon?
Melb. wheelwomen. As a matter of fact one
F ar e'y,f ees a pair of unskirted legs across a bike
in Melbourne now. Even the Mrs. B. Pot. pants
only gave a brief fillip to knickers. Skirts with
aprons, or with cords that allow of the adjustment
of the length of the garment, are the most
popular styles with fashionable bicyclists
Knickers never had any real chance ; there are
too many crooked-legged and ugly-legged women
about.
“ Lady Brassey still patronizes the Working
y iris Cooking Class at S. Melb., and comes round
hi vice-regal person, from time to time, to witnesi
the students wrestling with side dishes.
“A Parliamentarian, prominent in the Yic
Opposition, said he would accept the invitation
for the Prahran Mayor’s ball, provided a
lady-relative and himself were asked to danca

all arrangements had been made. The statesman
and party did not attend.

A Hard-working 1 Woman
sooner or later suffers from back-ache, nervow
ness, sinking sensations, heat flushes, sallow cob.
plexion, fainting spells, or slight spasms of dizz-
ness. These symptoms vanish by a short use &
the so-called “Women’s Friend,” Warner’s “ Sab-
Cure ; at least, those who have tried it say so.
Mrs. C. Williams, store-keeper, Dunedin, uirnt
date 20th June, 1896, writes: “Six or seve;
years ago I had severe pains over the .body and it
the region of my heart to such an extent that *
could not walk up the least bit of a rise without
becoming completely exhausted. My legs wer»
also swollen, and the irritation so great that .
could have torn them to pieces, and as a matter o
fact I suffered from sleeplessness and was abs<
lutely fit for nothing, so I consulted our local D.
and he told me I had heart disease, to
which he treated me, but without doing me am
good, and finally told my husband that I coulc
not live a week. Having heard and read abou
Warner’s ‘ Safe ’ Cure as as a specific for kidnm
and liver disease, and reading letters from person,
who had suffered similar to me and had beei
cured, I could see the origin of my ailment wa>
weakness of the liver and kidneys. I procurer
Warner’s ‘ Safe ’ Cure, and the first three bottle*
I took made me feel very bad. The medicim
seemed to strike the affected parts, and to Da-
doing its work, so I kept on taking it, and fo-
lowed strictly the dietary instructions, so tha*
when I had finished the fourth bottle I began u
improve rapidly, and may say that up to tin-
present time have enjoyed splendid health. I an.
never done recommending it to all sufferers, anc
always will, as I consider it a wonderful medicine
lam never without Warner’s ‘ Safe ’ _ Cure, anc
use no other medicine for my children if they ar*
the least out of sorts.”*

THE NEW WOMAN, AGAIN!
Time, 12 noon, 14/8/96. Place, Elizabeth and
Bourke Streets, Melbourne.
It is an open secret that, if Kingston’s
Law Reform Bill is passed, Treas. Holder will
seek to qualify for the Bar
Cricketer Percy M ‘Donnell, who died last
week, was a son of Morgan Augustus M‘Donnell,
Attorney-General in the Sladen (Vic.) Ministry,
1868, and again in the M‘Pherson Ministry, ’69-70.
The late George Verdon inscribed on his
wife’s tomb her true title, “Dame” Elizabeth
Verdon. Common knights’ wives have no right
to the title “Lady,” any more than a commoner
married to a peeress has a right to call himself
“ Lord ” Smith.
The well-known hermit of North Harbor
(Sydney) died, the other day, aged 73. He was a
morose anchorite with property, who lived mainly
on the scraps left behind by picnic parties. Also,
his name was Cohen—as might be expected. Who
is there of any note whose name isn’t more or less
Cohen ?
R. L. Stevenson used to say that he
believed his true name was “Macgregor.” He
founded this belief on the legend that the Mac-
gregors were at one time forbidden by the powers
that were to use their clan-name. Nearly every
Scot whose name does not begin with the orthodox
“Mac’’gives the above as an explanation of the
phenomenon.
Anatomy Professor Watson, of Adelaide
Univ., has so little stiffness about him that he
was seen the other day in King William-street
chewing a penny bun as he progressed. Fancy
Melb. Professor Tucker chewing bananas on Col-
lins-street Block, or Anderson Stuart gorging a
Scotch-pie in George-street ! Even fancy couldn’t
compass that.
Taking M.L. Ministry and Lower House
as a guide, Scotch blood does not preponderate so
much in Maoriland as credited. The nationalities
run England, 21; Scotland, 16; Ireland, 13;
Maoriland, 13 (including 2 full-blooded Maoris
and 1 half-caste) ; India, 3; Victoria, 3 ; N.S. W.,
2; South Australia, Tasmania, Cornwall, and
East Indies, 1 each.
Biology-Professor Baldwin Spencer, of
Melb. University, will most probably soon receive
a Fellowship of the Royal Society of London in
recognition of ten years’ splendid work in Austra-
lian zoology, botany and exploration. Another to
receive that distinction in the near future will be
Prof. Dendy, of Christchurch, M.L., for work on
Australian sponges and land planaria.
“ It’s lucky in more ways than one,” said
a N.S.W. Minister of the Crown lately, “ that
poets are more diffident or have a better sense of
self-respect than artists. Do you think I want
these statues, busts, oil-paintings and other draw-
ings ? On the contrary. But I’m pestered by
artists of all degrees. If Australian poets haunted
me with dedicatory verses in the same way I’d
surrender public life. ”

John Douglas, the autocrat of Thursday
Island, now in Sydney, has been M.P. for one
province of Australia, Premier of another, and
Special High Commissioner of the newly-appro-
priated New Guinea. He served a term as Agent-
General in London ? and has lived for years as
journalist, book-reviewer, and general magazine
writer. He is one of the few University graduates
who collected a following in Australian politics.
Julian Thomas once attempted a series of
lectures, but soon abandoned them, he being by no
means so successful on the platform as with his pen.
When he was orating at Mooroopna, a Via up-
country town, on “ Convicts and Cannibals an
individual rose and started to leave the hall, i
old Yag., who was extremely touchy, arrested the
deserter with, “ You might wait a few minutes
sir, I’m coming to the convicts now. Which le
to an incurable coolness between the Vag. ana
Mooroopna.
The town of Maryborough (Q.) is trying
desperately to induce Maryborough (Vic.) to
change its name—for the sake of postal conveni-
ence. Considering that the latter is much the
older town the request is somewhat cool—to say
the least. The grovelsome Courier suggests that
the Queensland hamlet adopt the name of Laming-
ton. Considering Maryborough’s leech-like pro-
clivity for eternally sucking the public revenue,
perhaps Vampire ville would be about the most
suitable appellation.
Col. Home, the irrigation expert, who
will shortly take up work in N.S. Wales, illus-
trates the change of mood for which many elderly
men are remarkable. Seven years ago he retired
from the Indian field, saying and, no doubt,
believing that his irrigation career had come to an
end. Thirty-six years of active labor in one
sphere left him without desire for any more of it.
But a little rest, a little intercourse with the old
society, and at the age of 62 he volunteers to take
up the same class of work in the Australian wilds.
Dr. Nicholson communicated with
Sydney University authorities the other
day, requesting that certain Egyptian
relics should be forwarded from the
Nicholson Museum to the Foreign
Office for ultimate transmission to
Egypt. The doctor’s letter was
Tike a voice from the far-away
past, and was unknown to all
but one or two at the beard.
Dr. Nicholson was the first
Chancellor of Sydney Univer-
sity, and the man who started
and sustained the enthusiasm
which called that institution
into being.
Dr. Madden would never have been made
Vic. Chief Justice but for the fact that the wife
of Hartley Williams once grievously slighted the
gilded wife of a certain politician. A feminine
quarrel was imported via politics into the judi-
ciary, and a windy, waxed advocate was appointed
C.J. over the heads of half-a-dozen sound lawyers
who could give him seven furlongs on a law course
and win every time.
EMINENTLY PROBABLE.
NEWCHUM : “ You have a good deal of tick here in Queensland, I believe?”
ISAACSTEIN : “It nefer drouble me, mine vrendt — dal's all I can say!”
Ami: “ Deakin’s spiritualism evaporated
after he married the attractive daughter of spirit-
distiller Brown.”
Since arriving in London, Louis Becke has
had much trouble with his eyes, “probably
caused,” he says, “ by the shock of looking in the
glass and seeing myself arrayed in Piccadilly cos-
tume. I looked like a confidence-man waiting at
Redfern for his prey. W. P. Reeves called to see
me yesterday. When I saw him in tall hat and
frock-coat, the littleness of my own tall hat and
long-coat seemed to grow less, and I felt that,
after all. one touch of the tall hat makes Aus-
tralians in London kin—in misery.”
Editor Bonython, of S.A. Advertiser,
will be 48 Oct. 15, and Editor Finlayson, of the
Register, will be 53 Feb. 3 next. Both were
junior reporters together on the papers which they
now control.
Rev. D. Laseron (Anglican) has for two or
three years carried about with him a bullet acci-
dentaily discharged from the pistol of the sportive
Thomas Walker, ex-M.P., who was monkeying
with the weapon in a railway-carriage. Hitherto
the doctors have failed to locate the bullet, but it
has now been distinctly placed by the Rontgen
Erocess manipulated by Father Slattery, of St.
tanislaus R.C. College, Bathurst. How pleasant
are these little ecclesiastical amenities ! One shep-
herd doing his best to see what his rev. rival is
stuffed with.
A Speaker who regards his salary as some-
thin? to live on and not to spend to some extent
in hospitalities, is not popular with M’sP. Vie.
Assembly members frequently have their nostrils
assaulted by the perfume of banquets from the
Council side of Parliament House, when the gilded
President Zeal gives lavish entertainments—one a
week at least on an average. But poor Speaker
Berry stokes not his flock. This is a hungry change
from' the gorgeous Davies days when the yellow-
bearded, paper Croesus fairly hosed the throats of
with fizz.
Baron Grant, the onetime mighty pro-
moter of companies, failed again lately for a paltry
,£42,000. He has dwindled down to a mere shadow
of the person whose epitaph was posted in an
epigram on a notice-board of London Stock Ex-
change—
Titles a king can give,
Honor he can’t :
A title without honor
Makes a Barren Grant.
Grant’s title was made to order in Germany; but,
after all, it isn’t a more ghastly satire on personal
“ distinction ” than the average Australian knight-
hood.
The late James M‘Bain, when President
of Vic. Leg. Council, frequently entertained visi-
tors from Saturday to Monday at his Toorak
house. On Sunday the guests were personally
conducted by James to kirk. On one occasion the
late “Jack ” Robertson was of the party. Jack’s
language frequently called forth a warning “Shish ”
from his host, but when in kirk the old man re-
marked in a stage whisper, “ Jimmy, haven’t you
got a (Australian adjective) hymn-book for me?”
“Jimmy ” looked at him reproachfully and said :
“ I dinna ken o’ ony sic hymn-buicks.Old Jack
snored throughout the rest of the service.
Queen Victoria formally accepted the title
of “ Godmother ” of Victoria, when that division
of Australia separated from N.S. Wales. Which
may account for the ultra-loyalty of Cabbage
Gardeners.
Within a week after his arrival in London
Louisßecke received severallettersfrom young mei
who want to go to the Islands, asking him to mate
appointments, &c. One of these gentlemen wrote
that he was willing to take a position as manage
of a plantation, or (sic) “a kanaka factory
also that he had some money to put into eithe:
industry. The shocking depravity of the secont
suggestion dumbfounded Becke ; but later an ei
planation came —the young man meant a copr
mill.

Adam Johns, whose death is wired fro -
the Northern Territory, was a man well-known n
Northern Australia as a pioneer-prospector, a firs-
ilass bushman, and a right good hospitable fellov
He and his mate, Phil Saunders, went over fron
the Palmer (Q.) in the early days of the Territory
and Johns stuck there, through good and evil fo>
tune. Johns, with Saunders and another man
made a dashing trip from Roeburne to the tei-
graph-line, about the year ’7B. There was l.
flourish of trumpets about Johns’ trip—that wi«
reserved for Alex. Eorrest, over almost the sam
line of country. After confronting death in score
of shapes, Johns was thrown from a buggy an
broke his neck. And so departs another of tt
gallant armv of “outsiders.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
What a lot of friends the Australian Gas-
light Co. has got in N.S.W. Leg. Council!
Squatter Staughton, M.P., frequently
dines members of Vic. Labor party. Little game ?
Extract from the election-address of a
Wellington (M.L.) alderman: “I have had the
honor of representing you for the past three years,
and during that time have always upheld the
opinion that the city must progress or else go
backward. ”
MARRIAGE WITHOUT CONSENT!
(Sketched in George-street.)
Premier Reid is the N.S.W. “jumping
frog.” Sydney D.T., however, has crammed him
up with buckshot.
In the past eight years only 19 Chinese
have paid the N.S.W. poll-tax—less than an
average of three a year. In the same period 5160
Chinese have left—an average of close on 700 a
year.
N. : “ Higinbotham was the only Impeni-
tent of Verdon’s political colleagues. I suppose
Freetraders would add Thief. Anyhow, the moral
is, after Verdon and Co. saying Higinbotham led
them away with his glamor, that the working-class
must trust no more to aristocratic gladiators.”
The six wealthiest men in S.A.—Angas,
Elder, Barr Smith, Simms, Hay, and A. B.
Murray—are all over 70. This is why the esti-
mated income this year from probate and succes-
sion duties is placed so high. Gray, the million-
aire who died last month, lived to be 86, but he cut
up his estate in settlements on grand-children.
Three heads of big departments have been
struck down in S.A. within four weeks. Police-
Commissioner Peterswald was the first to go.
Exactly a week afterwards School-Inspeetor-
General Hartley met with his terrible accident.
He lingered seven days, and again, exactly a week
later, Lands-Minister Gillen died suddenly.
The suggestion of Edden, M.P. (N.S.W.),
that Civil servants, when aggrieved, should com-
bine and strike, has been long ago mooted both in
Queensland and Victoria in respect to the police-
force and the public education service. All that
came of the movement, however, was the official
weeding-out, under various pretexts, of the initia-
tors of the plan of campaign.
Talking of paradoxical statesmen, like
Parnell and Laurier, Wilberforce Stephen was Chan-
cellor of Melb. (Anglican) diocese when he intro-
duced the secular Education Bill “to squelch the
Catholics.” But, after all, Stephen’s Act was
hardly paradoxical. The sects hate one another a
thousand times more than they love their own
Mumbo-Jumbos, and often cut their own noses to
spoil the other fellow’s face.
Lands-Minister Gillen (S.A.), who died
suddenly of heart-disease at a Cabinet meeting
last week, was but 38 years old, and absolutely
the most popular man in S.A. politics. He was
always a consistent Liberal, invariably cheerful,
and as honest as the day. Mr. Gillen owed his
early decease to rheumatic fever, caught while
roughing it at Silverton in the boom-days, and
doctors frequently advised him to drop politics.
Gladstone on dual voting -
To the dual vote, I record an implacable hostility. This
dual vote is, in the first place, a gigantic fraud. It is a
proclamation of a war of classes. The British Constitu-
tion rests, and has rested from time immemorial, on the
mutual goodwill, respect and good-feeling of the people,
and upon the equality which they enjoy before the eye of
the law. When you place in the hands of the rich man
this weapon to use-against his fellow-countrymen, on that
day you sow oppression.
Staughton, M.P., the Vic. squattocrat,
who imagines his class to be the salt of the earth,
is blessed with splendid impudence. During a
private enterprise discussion in the House the
other night, m reply to an interjection from Pren-
dergast, a Labor man, he cried with withering
contempt: What will become of this country
when the hon. member and his confreres have
control of the banks ? ” Staughton’s confreres
have had the control of the banks so far, and
came within an ace of breaking the country. The
Vic. hat Man who thinks anyone would do worse
in a bank than his friends have done is indeed a
dreadful pessimist.
The very latest reason why Bathurst
(N.S.W.) should be the Federal capital is alleged
to have been advanced by Webb, M.L.C. : “ Be-
cause the legislators would not be likely to be
affected by outside influences as might be the case
if Albury was chosen as the Government seat,
because then the Senate would most likely be
swayed by Victorian influences.” What about
Victoria objecting to the Senate being swayed by
N.S.W. influences? And are not Victoria and the
other provinces to be allowed to have any in-
fluences in the. matter ? The present cornstalk
idea of Federation seems to be that N.S.W. is to
select the capital and run the whole show.
The estimated drink-bill of Maori-
land has gone down steadily from <£lolos.
per head in ’69 to £3 os. sd. per head in
’95. Apparently the country is gradually
becoming teetotal by mere force of habit,
and under these conditions the Cold-Tea
faction might do as well to let things go
as they are. When an animal has been
going in the right direction for 26 years,
and you build a fire under him to make
him keep on going that way, a lot of
things may happen.
The Cold Tea vote is the unknown
quantity at Maoriland election. The Go-
vernment party is, in the main, the anti-
liquor faction, and the Opposition mostly
represents the beer and whisky vote.
Therefore, if the wild-eyed prohibitionists
insist on running candidates of their own
all over the place, as they seem likely to
do, on the ground that the Govt, following
isn’t sufficiently frantic in the cause, it is
the Govt, vote which they will split. At
the Christchurch bye-election they suc-
ceeded in dividing 8500 Liberals so equally
between the direct Cold Tea candidate
and the Government and partial Cold Tea
candidate that the Tory representative got
in on the strength of a vote of very little
over 5000, and both the entire and partial
Cold Tea men were left. And this time
the party is going out to wave its shirt more furi-
ously than ever, and split the democratic vote all
it knows, on the ground that Cold Tea comes
“ afore he very think.”
The Woman’s Suffrage and Plural-voting
Abolition Bill will not lack a vigorous champion
when it gets to Vic. Leg. Council this time.
Wrixon is a strong supporter of both principles,
and his opinion already carries great weight with
the mostly-senile members of that tiresome body.
Nevertheless, the Turner Govt, expects the mea-
sure to be rejected, and has only introduced it
again in order that it may be one of its main
planks for next election.
“ LIFE HAD NO CHARMS
THE BEAR : “ Hold on, old man, don’t shoot yet.
How did we get on in that last test-match?”
BOY: “Oh! we went down. The Englishmen won.”
BEAR: “ Well, shoot away!”
Premier Reid is getting unpopular with
the N.S.W. Civil Service. At the reorganisation
which took effect on July 1 a whole lot of public
officials had their salaries reduced, while a good
many received increases. The reductions started
immediately; as for the increases, at the time of
going to press (Tuesday) none of them had been
paid, and if they don’t come along this month
the service will waylay Reid in a dark place and
bite him to death.

Graham, M.L.A. (Vic.), has withdrawn his
Bill to enable a plebiscite to be taken on the ques-
tion of introducing Scripture lesson-books into the
State schools, giving as his reason, that members
wrongly thought that he desired to introduce the
Irish National Readers instead of the N.S.W.
ones, and were consequently unprepared to deal
with the subject. Is this Mr. Graham’s reason, or
have some of his holy friends been pointing out to
him. that his Bill is “uncalled for” and “ill-
advised” after the result of the S.A. plebiscite,
when the “unco guid” got such a “ facer.”
Sydney Telegraph is publishing a series
of articles on the evils of Protection in Victoria.
The first one begins in this fine, off-hand fashion :
The definite adoption of the policy of Freetrade by the
colony of N.S.W., the satisfactory results which have fol-
lowed that step in spite of the adverse circumstances—last
year’s drought—under which it was taken, the certainty
that .every month that passes by will demonstrate still
more fully the great advantages which freedom of ex-
change brings in its train, cannot fail to influence the
policy of the neighboring colonies.
Well, when everything is definite and satisfactory
and certain, what is there left to talk about ?
It is definitely proposed to extend the rail-
way into Sydney as far as Park-street, and build
a new station on 10 acres of Hyde Park. The ex-
tension is estimated to cost ,£600,000. An exten-
sion to Park-street is a poor, make-shift apology
for a city railway, but by putting the station there
instead of bringing it to King-street or Hunter-
street, Parliament avoids debiting the department
with the. cost of a new site, and this keeps down
the nominal cost of the railways and makes the
percentage of profit look bigger. Therefore, the
chances are that the Hyde Park scheme will be
adopted.
Giles, M.P., a brother-in-law of the S.A.
Minister of Education, but a fierce opponent of
the Kingston Govt., says the gift of free school-
*'oks to State school children would
warrant the Catholics rising in re-
volt. He is a Protestant, but
represents a very R.C. district,
and lives up to the priests on
, all political occasions.
Ninian Melville, ex-
Chairman of Committees
(N.S.W.), who hopes to
recapture his old seat
at next election, favors
the Referendum. This
is generous in Ninny,
seeing that as Mayor
of Ashfield his was the
first salary or allowance
submitted to the Refer-
endum in Australia.
The amount was only
.£lOO, but the ratepayers
squashed the proposal.
Melville, M. L. 0., as-
tounded Vic. House of Land-
lords by proposing that, as women
were to have municipal votes, it
was as well to be consistent and give
them, the right of being elected as coun-
cillors or of becoming Mayor. The coun-
cillors fairly shrieked at the idea, and the
proposer dropped it. Yet how refreshing it would
be to have a young woman Mayor for a change !
Premier Reid : “ I will be no party to an
extension of the (Sydney city) railway to the
wharves until the wharves are the property of the
State.” Cut this out and paste up for future
reference. The democratic argument upholding it
is that the extension to the wharves will “put
millions of money into private pockets.” Paste it
up, then, and wait. It was Premier Reid who
said that he would never bring in a land-tax until
he had passed a Local Government Bill.
Westralian Parliament last week rejected
the proposal to pay M’sL.A. by 18 votes to 5.
While the boom lasts, Westralian politicians can
pay themselves so much more handsomely than
the country would pay them that to pass such a
measure would have been sheer suicide. The
man who, for the sake of <£3oo a year salary,
brings a dozen more candidates into the field to
rob him of a billet that is indirectly worth thou-
sands, doesn’t know enough to be sure of his own
name and address.
Old Henry Scotland, who has
dozed in Maoriland Leg. Council
for 28 years, is against the proposal
to open the legal profession to
women because “it would be a fear-
ful thing to see a worn an.-judge
sitting on the bench sentencing a
fellow-woman to death.” So it
would. But if the country can
stand the spectacle of a woman in
the dock being sentenced to death
by a man, and sometimes a darned
ruffianly-looking man at that, or of
a woman on the scaffold beingpawed
by the hairy hands of a male hang-
man, surely it needn’t worry over a
trifle like this. By-the-way, why,
in the name of decency, not have
a lady-hangman when a woman is
to be choked ?
It is noteworthy that almost
all the Leg. Councils of Australia
approve enthusiastically of pro-
posals for reducing the membership
of the Assemblies. In particular,
the Yic. Council is wildly cordial
about proposals for reducing the
number of M’s.L.A. in its province,
despite the fact that in Victoria
there is already much less member
in proportion to population than
anywhere else in Australasia. There
are various good reasons for this
enthusiasm. The larger the As-
sembly electorates are made the
more expensive will be the elec-
tions, and expense is a big handi-
cap to the beastly labor-member.
Again, it is almost certain that,
some day or other, some means
will have to be devised to obviate
the frequent deadlocks that arise
between the two Houses. The
simplest and most probable means
is to provide that, in cases of dis-
agreement, the two Houses shall sit
and vote as one. Then the smaller
the Assembly is—the Assembly
being the House where the disgust-,
ing democrats are gathered together
—the better for the Fat Man in-
terest, and Fat Man looks ahead and sees it.
Railway - Commissioner Matliieson says
that the deadhead curse is worse in Victoria than
anywhere else within his experience. Considering
that two previous sets of Commissioners have
been at work reducing the curse, it must have
been pretty bad in the riotous boom days. Among
other things, Mathieson complains that over 4000
ex-employes have passes simply because they
were once in the service, and this, added to pre-
sent employes, Members of Parliament, relations
of ditto, distinguished visitors, civil servants, &c.,
makes the newly-engaged Scotchman threaten to
attack the dreadful problem with an axe.

When is the N.S.W. Local Government
Bill going to be heard of again, and when are the
existing municipalities going to kick on the sub-
ject? Less than one-hundredth part of N.S.W.
has any system of local government, but this in-
corporated fragment represents two-thirds of the
population. Therefore, it pays not only for all its
own minor public works, but through the general
revenue for two-thirds of those of the unincor-
porated districts; in other words, the latter only
pay one-third of their fair share’of the expendi-
ture. If the people of the existing municipalities
would only get a firm grip of the situation they
would inquire after that Local Government Bill
in a much louder tone than heretofore.

A Riot of Loydii)€Ss.
The Suffield Case.
Editor Bulletin,— Unintentionally, I am sure,
you do myself and wife a wrong in representing
that, when Suffield was committed at Lambton
police-court, she “threw her arms about his neck
and kissed him.” Nothing of the kind ever hap-
pened. What actually took place was this : After
Suffield was committed for trial at Lambton police-
court, and when he was being taken away to
Maitland, my wife and I, with a crowd of other
friends, were in the yard to wish him good-bye.
He shook hands with all; and, when shaking
hands with my wife, he kissed her on the cheek
before she could stop him, at the same time thank-
ing her “ for all her kindness to him.” Sergeant
Salter and Inspector Brennan were present, and
will corroborate me. At the time my wife was
nearly 40 years of age, and mother of five children.
And this, so far as I know, is absolutely the
whole foundation for the cruel slander attributed
(on what authority I know not) to Judge
Windeyer in the Legislative Assembly. For
this slander apparently we have no redress. A
Judge, it would appear from the report in Han-
sard, may say what he pleases—and in order to
prop up his previous convictions may blast a
woman’s character, and make her husband and
children by-words—and there is no remedy. lam
a gardener by profession, and the other day I
applied for a position and produced good references
covering the last 25 years. The gentleman read
on till he came to the one (from Mr. Croudace)
which proved my identity, when he looked up
aghast and remarked: “You are the man who
was mixed up in that Suffield case?” “Yes.”
“ Ah, well, you know, I really cannot employ you
about my place. Good-morning.” This is what
one gets for taking up the cause of an innocent
man, in defiance of wealth and influence. — James
Warren.
Peter Paul Gillon, S.A. Lands Minister,
died suddenly last week at a Cabinet meeting.
This makes the second gap in the Kingston
Ministry, Gordon’s defection supplying the first.
When Judge Williams discoursed to a
Melb. jury on the difference between the English
and Victorian law re age of consent, he might
have very well added a remark on the difference
between climatic conditions in the two countries.
Amplified with due regard for this important
?oint, the Judge’s address would have read thus :
n Victoria, if a precocious, meat-gorged youth of
seventeen yielded to the solicitation of an early-
matured girl, only a day under sixteen, then that
youth is a felon. According to the English Act,
if the defendant had reasonable grounds for
believing that the girl was sixteen, that would be
a good defence. The Victorian Act omits that
provision. The English Act, notwithstanding the
comparative backwardness of Mrs. Grundy’s
daughter, makes the offence only a misdemeanour.
In Victoria, where girls are forward, and the
temptation of opportunity much greater, the
offence is a crime.
A return just presented to Vic. Parlia-
ment shows that the Hobart Exhibition Commis-
sion cost that groaning country over .£4OOO. Wild
stories are told of the pranks of commissioners. A
youthful M.P. was a non-smoker before becoming
a commissioner, and he was taught to smoke and
be sick at the expense of his grateful country.
The' cigars laid in for the consumption of the other
members were too strong for him, so a large
quantity of mild cigarettes were bought for his
especial benefit. He did not take kindly to them,
however; and then cigarettes were plentiful among
commissioners’ friends. This junketting body
was appointed by Patterson, but Turner has had
to find the money for it.
Ed. Bulletin, Mr. Justice Stephen
(N.S.W.) last week refused to grant a stay of
proceedings in the case of Woodin v. Aus-
tralian Star, a case in which Woodin re-
cently recovered .£5O damages for libel. The
Star, it appears, published in a report of a
Police-court case an information which was not
read in open court, and Judge Stephen holds, and
thinks the Full Court would hold, that the publi-
cation of this unread information was not privi-
leged. This view is, doubtless, correct. The
Defamation Act (sec. 5) enacts that no action will
lie for a faithful and accurate report of any
judicial proceedings, provided, however, that these
proceedings are “not of a preliminary nature.”
This proviso is an exceedingly important one.
Any proceeding before a magistrate, where he
cannot exercise a summary jurisdiction, but is
obliged to commit for trial, is not a judicial pro-
ceeding at all—there he is only acting minis-
terially, and holding an enquiry to ascertain if
there be a prima facie case against the accused.
On this ground, therefore, a report of such pro-
ceedings would not fall within the protection of
the Act. Even if this were not so, the enquiry
would come within the exception quoted above,
for it is essentially “of a preliminary nature.”
This is an aspect of the case which papers whose
staple of news consists of flaring reports of Police-
court proceedings should give attention to; it is
one, moreover, which does not seem to have
occurred to anyone at the trial of the case referred
to.—Rus. Roberts.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
Betsy Cook, of Maoriland, sends The Bulletin
some touching verses re the “ Decline and Fall of Eng-
lish Cricket.” At the outset Betsy remarked that “ John
Bull, in sorry plight, appeals to eastern potentate to help
him in the fight ” :
“ In cricket field Old England’s power is sadly on the
wane :
Her former proud and premier place she ne’er may hold
again; !
No longer.can her sons alone uphold her honored name —
A dusky Indian Prince must aid in each important game.
Let’s mourn the loss of England’s power ; then loudly let
us sing the
Praises of her stout ally, her saviour, Ranjitsinjhi.”
The rash lady had got as far as this when her line of argu-
ment snapped.
“ But stay—the cable brings me news which causes me to
blush
And hide my head for wishing into poetry to rush.
Without Ran jit., or outside aid, by Thornton’s third-rate
crew
Australia’s champions have been licked—oh, such a lick-
ing, too ! ”
A few lines of reproof for the fair penitent will also serve
as information for other cricket bards who have expressed
similar sentiments in a not much worse form.
O, Betsy Cook, O, Betsy Cook, your beauty rare distracts*
Attention from the evidence of simple little facts.
Twice Ranji played for Hingland, and once he was a
“frost,”
And when he made a mighty score, why, hang it 1 Hing-
land lost 1
And when Our Boys got fairly done, with bat as well as
ball,
Great Britain’s dusky saviour wasn’t on the job at all.
Give no more heed, dear Betsy, to the Ranjitsinjhi
“gag” ;
He didn’t win one battle for old Hingland’s tattered flag.
The blowhards who have led you to imagine otherwise
Were dealing out suggestions of apologetic lies.
So keep on blushing, Betsy, and hide your pretty head
In the lower kitchen region whence the family is fed ;
Refrain from writing poems, and, should you chance to
hook
A husband, pray, endeavour to preserve the name of
Cook.

ball at, the same time. I do not find such versatility in
English cricket,” But haven’t Ulyett, Barnes, Peel, Loh-
mann, Attewell, and even little Briggs “ done a bit both
ways” against Australia at one time or other ?
* * * *
Says the Referee man touching the “ strike ”
of Abel, Richardson and co., before the last test-match :
“ It is no use disguising the fact that when English pro-
fessors grow a little bit stiff-necked concerning terms for
playing Australians they have in mind occasions on which
the latter wanted big figures, and to make the best of the
market. One is apt to lose sight of the fact that our
teams, while touring away from the old country, have
had to put up with high prices, though any charge is
supposed to be unknown, according to Trott. This old
grievance has been smouldering ever since our pros, were
asked to meet Dave Gregory’s team in England.” But
anti-Australian feeling among the pros, was never appar-
ent until the last team brought out hereby Shaw and
Shrewsbury returned home poorer in pocket, with a tale
of shabby treatment. That was the team which bad
made arrangements to take the trip before the Melbourne
and Sydney clubs determined to invite an opposition
eleven, under Stoddart’s captaincy.

In Percy M‘Donnell, the dashing batsman
whose portrait is printed in this issue, there died a
cricketer who could laugh in the face of the biggest odds,
and wrest victory out of the heart of defeat. He was a
cricketer to whom every other cricketer paid homage.
On any wicket, against any bowling, M‘Donnell went in
to score. If at a crisis he failed he failed gamely ; if he
succeeded the other side wore its boots out chasing the
ball. Such an event happened in North of England v.
’BB Aus. Eleven, when M‘Donnell went in first with Alex.
Bannerman on a shocking wicket, and after hitting the
first ball out of the ground, banged up 83 while Banner-
man scored 3; “ one of the grandest efforts ever wit-
nessed,” says W. G. Grace. This grand effort indeed won
the match. M'Donnell was one of that famous trio
which scored 416 against All England in ’B4, M'Donnell
making 103 ; Murdoch, 211; and Scott, 102. M‘Donnell
played with four Aus. Elevens in England ; the ’BO, the
’B2, the ’B4, and the ’BB, and never cricketer or spectator
dreamt of accusing him once of funk. He died of heart-
disease at the early age of 36.

The Leader’s shilling subscription in aid of the
Blackham testimonial threatens to be the reverse of a great
success. Boss Syme led off with 100 shillings in one lump
pour encourager les autres, but seemingly this wholesale
donation scared them. At the end of a week or so only
52 more “bobs” had trickled in from the general public,
which doesn’t say much for the durability of Australian
hero-worship. It seems only the other day that the sun
was supposed to rise from one of the gallant Blackham’s
boots and set in the other.
* * • •
“In the Surrey pavilion,” writes “Monico”
from London to The Bulletin, “hangs a panoramic
photographic picture of the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
Owing to faulty ‘fixing’ faded brown patches more or less
disfigure the turf, and at these the Hinglishers point
exulting that ‘ They haven’t the nice green grass we have,
you know ; the sun is so hot they have to play on matting
to keep their feet from getting sunburnt.’ And yet
the Oval never shows an unbroken top of green, and the
Lords’ pitches are bowlers’ wickets after, if not before,
one day s play.
“ To the right of the aforementioned represen-
tation of the M.C.C. ground with the measles hangs an
illuminated plate telling of the doings of the first English
team in Australia. Under Spiers and Pond’s manage-
ment, a Surrey eleven were the pioneers in 1861-2. Their
first match against a Victorian 18 jwas so big a victory
that thenceforth they played teams of 22, losing but three
matches—two against N.S.W. and Vic. combined, and one
against Castlemaine by 2 runs. In one of the combined
matches the Surreyites made but 10 runs. The scroll
almost libellously relates an overwhelming defeat inflicted
on ‘22 Geelongese,’ whoever they were; but perhaps a
vowel has been left out.
“ The Surrey team of 1864 rejoiced in the
possession of a bowler named Julius Csesar, whose fast
deliveries discovered the clunks in the batsmen’s armour,
and, having funked them, bowled them, to the savage
delight of the old enthusiasts, who, sucking ‘ church-
wardens ’ and earthen mugs of ‘ bitter,’ expressed their
grim terse approval of their hero.
“Kennington Oval is leased to the club by the
Prince of Wales at a nominal rent of about £4OO p.a., with
the stipulation that the view from the surrounding houses
is not to be interfered with, and that all men in uniform
are admitted free. Soldiers, sailors, postmen, railway-
porters, &c., largely avail themselves of this gratuitous
entry, to the disgust of the 5.C.0., who are the keenest
gate-money grabbers outside Australia.
“Jonah’s non-acceptance of the Sussex offer
arose through the rigid interlaced bindings of the agree-
ment and not through family considerations. The
Broken Hill man may yet do better, but what can Aus-
tralia offer him ? At the most, £3 a week for six months
of the year, and for how long will even that last ?
“ ‘ Joe ’ Trott has put on nearly two stone since
he left home, but looks the picture of health. His rival
captain, ‘ W.G.,’turns the scale at 18st., so it cannot be
wondered at his pins showing signs of weakness. ‘ Grace
isn’t half a bad sort’ is Trotty’s summing-up, and he
adds, ‘ The trip has been wonderfully free from any
serious friction.’ He thinks a very warm reception will
await Stoddart’s next team, which is to include Ranji,
G. R. Mason, the young Kent amateur (a nephew of Mr.
Stuart Mason, of Sydney), Lilley (wicketkeeper), and per-
haps Mold, Mead, O’Brien, the Irish baronet, and Abel, if
sufficient inducement be offered.
“ George Lohmann, the scapegoat of the ‘ pros’.’
strike, will net about £2OOO altogether from his theatrical
and cricket benefits and subscription testimonials. Royal
princes, bishops, generals, and Judges appear as subscri-
bers to the latter, and ‘tenners,’ ‘scores,’ and ‘ponies’
begem the list, and advise in eloquent silence, ‘ Go on
the turf, young man ; go on the turf.’
“There’s an inoffensive lollypop-maker from
South Melb. who follows the Australians from match to
match with blindly patriotic admiration. At the exciting
epoch in the Manchester test, when the collapsibles were
struggling to get 120 runs to ensure victory, Taffy
entered the dressing-room with the usual enquiry
for Trott. A fiddle-string-strung batsman, who lay on
the floor to avoid seeing the progress of the game, re-
lieved his nervous tension until he ran down, and then
wound up with, ‘Go out of this ornate room ! The last
time you came in here a wooden wicket fell, and ’-—with a
groan, as a wildly exultant yell burst through the window
—‘ there’s another ! ’ It was true—Harry Donnan was
out.”
* * * *
“The ninth Australian Eleven looks upon it-
self,” writes “An Australian Abroad,” to The Bulle-
tin, “as an organisation complete in itself, and under the
government of no outside body. Cricketers considered it
wiser in the selection of the team that the hall-mark of
the Aus. Cricket Council’s approval should be obtained,
but nothing more. That approval having been obtained,
the Council is said to have no further voice in the matter,
and the team becomes, what all other teams have been,
the private financial speculation of the men themselves.
They can go on as long as they choose, and are by no
means bound to stop at the close of the first set of
matches which happened to be arranged. I am only
stating what is evidently their opinion, and have nothing
to say as to the right or wrong of it. So far as I can see
at present, I know no reason why they shouldn’t go on as
long as they please, if they keep up their reputation and
don’t injure Australian cricket by not returning home.
“Fry and Ranjitsinjhi, in the Sussex match,
knocked the Australian bowling about as it had never
been knocked about before. In lh. lOmin. they made
110 runs, of which “ Ranji” was responsible for 74. But
the stolid Trumble pegged away with a good-length ball,
which did a little bit sometimes one way, sometimes
another, and when at last the Indian ran himself out, he
got his revenge by securing six wickets for an addition to
the score of 19 runs.
“ Syd. Gregory will require to be careful
for the next year or two, as his lungs have been pro-
nounced weak, and he has been ailing once or twice during
the tour from that cause. • 1
“Perkins, secretary of the M.C.C., after the
last of the Australian matches had been played at Lord’s,
wrote a hearty letter to the team saying that he hoped to
see its members all back again, as although he had had
dealings with all the teams that had come from Aus-
tralia he had never met a better set of sportsmen.”
* * * *
George Giffen’s cricketing reminiscences should
be interesting, but it would be a good idea to leave the
writing of one or two chapters to other scribes. _ For
instance, Blackham should be asked to give his opinion
of the incident in Adelaide, years ago, when Giffen de-
murred to going out when given out by the Vic. umpire,
and afterwards compiled a big score. Jack Blackham could
also write several interesting chapters on incidents in
England, when a certain gentleman who was bowling ob-
jected to go off when captain Blackham asked him to.
Coningham, the Queenslander, and Charley Turner would
probably like to contribute chapters, provided they were
not revised by the great George; and Blinman. of the
Norwood Club, could also furnish a few philosophical, re-
marks on “ Champion cricketers and how to conciliate
them,” having reference to Giffen’s resignation from the
Norwoods, who brought him out. Much interest would
centre around a narration of the circumstances which led
up to the inclusion of little brother Walter in the ’93
team, with a few remarks on a certain memorable English
fracas. If George refers to any of these things in his
little book, it will sell like hot cakes.
* * * *
At Blackburn, Eng., the other day, a bird flying
across the pitch was struck by the ball in its course to the
bat and killed instantly. Which recalls how Jack
Huddlestone, the notable Richmond (Vic.) cricketer of a
quarter-century back, once caught a swallow in mistake
for the ball in a moment of temporary aberration.
* * * *
English pen-picture of M‘Kibbin’s work : “He
goes through considerable manual exercises before
delivering the ball, which eventually emerges from the
middle of a disconnecting flourish.” . . . “ The curliest
of all the Australian bowlers.” . . .' “Has a cor!?*
screw delivery, with a tremendous break both ways, but
his pitch is very erratic.” . . . “ Made the batsmen
skip like mountain goats.”

From Raleigh (N.S.W.) Sun: “The team
picked to play against Ilempsey to-morrrow will consist
of A. M‘Lachlan, Collins, M’Geary, Briner, and as many
more as can come.”
• * * •
Giffen says he will never return to England,
where he has only been half himself this season with
influenza and sciatica.
* * * •
G. R. Sims, in the Referee: “What is the
difference between the first blow and the last strike?
‘ A.’: ‘ With the first blow Cain knocked Abel down, and
with the last strike Abel raised Cain. ’ ”

The Melb. Bicycle Club is quite right in insist-
ing that all competitors at next Austral meeting shall
sport jockey-costume and satin jackets. An Austral race
is a show, and nothing more, as far as most of the com-
petitors are concerned. The gaudier the show, the better
for gate-money.
♦ • » *
Sydney Bicycle Club’s meeting was a grievously
sick show, the only attractions of which were Kerr and
Cameron’s riding and the distribution of four cycles as
prizes. That Kerr has lost a deal of his old form is shown
by his beating Cameron by a mere shade in the Five Miles
Championship. Kerr also won the One-Mile Scratch Race
from such medium riders as Smith, Goodson and Marsden.
It looks as if Kerr had remained faithful to the lily-white
amateurs only to become a champion among weeds.

A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness and
Biliousness.
160 Elizabeth-st., Melb., July 18,1892.
Dear Sir,—l have much pleasure to inform you
that a course of your Alfaline Pills completely
cured me of a severe case of biliousness, wind and
nervousness. I may also mention that several of
my friends to whom I have recommended your
remedies have derived great benefit from them;
therefore, I consider you are deserving of success,
wmch I do most heartily wish you.—Yours grate-
fully, A. HARRIS, J.P.
Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of
the Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose testi-
mony carries special weight, writes thus : To Herr
Rassmussen.—Dear Sir, —I think it my duty to
inform you that a course of your Alfaline Vitality
Pills acted very beneficially on my nervous system,
and, in consequence, I have recommended them
to many friends, who have all been cured by their
use.—’Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.

Grand Hotel, Spring-st., Melbourne,
March 7th, 1895.
To Herr Rassmussen,
Proprietor of the Alfaline Remedies.
Dear Sir, —It gives me great pleasure to inform
you that I have derived great benefit from your
celebrated Alfaline Remedies during iny explor-
ing expeditions throughout Australia, and I con-
sider them invaluable to all travellers in the bush.
—Yours very truly, B. BUTTON,

Mr. Button writes later:—“The Pills I had
from you were of great benefit to me and others.
In, one case, when thbee hunters and trappers
were travelling about the ranges near my place on
the Rose River, one was taken very ill; his mates
intended taking him in a waggon to Wangaratta
(about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor. I
gave him a few of your Pills. lam pleased to
inform you that having to pass their camp next
day, I found him up and pegging-out his skins
and looking well. This speaks volumes for your
valuable Remedies.”
A Lady’s Wish. Fulfilled.
It gives me great pleasure indeed to inform
you that your celebrated Alfaline Universal Pills
cured me, when all other remedies and doctors
failed, of a stubborn case of Debility ot 18 years’
standing. My wish is fulfilled at last, and I don’t
know how to thank you enough. Dear Sir, I

Skin and Blood Cured.
Canning Mills, Canning', Western Australia.
To Here Rassmussen,
I am pleased to inform you that your Alfaline
Lock Cure Pills completely cured me of a very
bad disease. Previous to taking your Lock Pills,
I was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, but was getting no better; and I shall
never regret trying your Alfaline Pills, as they
had a wonderful effect on my complaint, which
several of my work-mates can testify to. I have
! recommended your Alfaline Herbal Remedies to
several of my friends, who have reason to be very
grateful for it, and I shall always do my best to
recommend them to any fellow sufferers. You
are authorised to publish this testimonial.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Eriday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.
Witness : Edward Hardy, proprietor Town
Hall Coffee Palace, 521 George-street.
A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having been
a sufferer from General Debility of the Nervous
System for over seven years, and having tried
without success several of the leading doctors
both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did
so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone
suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which
you have treated me, allow me to say that you
can make what use you may think proper of this.
Wishing you every success, allow me to remain,
yours,

The N.S. W. Wheelmen’s League (cash-amateurs)
and the Sydney Bicycle Club (amateurs)last Saturday ran
opposition shows on Sydney Agric. Ground and Cricket
Ground respectively; and, in point of prestige, the
League came slump.- Only 6000 spectators rolled up to
see the cash-amateurs race for “gold and glory,” whereas
over ln,ooo went to see the amateurs spin for the £lO
prize which didn’t cost £lO. Both shows were run on the
meanest cut-throat business tactics, and the cycling game,
having killed and forgotten all spirit of true sport, will
soon make itself stink like pony-racing and pedestrianism.
The amateur got his claw deepest into the public pocket
chiefly because, on the Cricket Ground, he could give
every Johnnie and his girl something to sit upon and to
rest their backs against.
*—* • *
The much-advertised Martin-M'Donell 25 miles’
contest for a prize of £5O and a side-wager of £5O resulted
in a dreary fiasco, despite newspaper hvsterics about
“ this great battle ” and the “ desperate efforts ” that the
men were going to niake ; alsoabout “ M'Donell, America’s
unpaced road king.” Martin had been telling everybody
that he had lost form through over-work, and his belief in
his own unfitness is shown by his refusing to take £l5O
to £lOO from M'Donell, and by his offering to make a
second match, win or lose the first one. Also he lowered
his gear from 06 to 8-3. M'Donell was in A 1 form and as
confident as if Martin-had only one leg.
M'Donell won choice of positions ; the men
started diagonally opposite each other so that half a lap
separated them. The.first half lap M'Donell gained 30yds.,
third lap 70ds. ; then the strong plugger and the strong
wind put in their say : by the ninth lap Martin had won
back every lost inch. Now the great physical superiority
of Martin manifested itself. With every stroke he gained
until in the 17th lap he caught his opponent with a power-
ful spurt. Then Martin sat up and breathed : the game
was won—for the remaining 62 laps he, being half a lap
ahead, need only hang upon his exhausted adversary and
let that broken-hearted feebleness make hopeless pace
against the gale. It was a retriever shepherding a winged
duck round and round a lagoon. At the 19th lap M'Donell
was so badly out of repair that he fell flat upon the grass,
but he got up and resumed the mad struggle with the
retriever paddling grimly in the rear.
M'Donnell’s trainer and friends tried, and in
vain, to persuade their man to quit; the League authori-
ties, recognising that the fiasco would injure their repu-
tation, olfered Martin <lO to lap M'Donell. But Bill-
martin wasn't having any at the price ; he had won £lOO
too easily to “ bust himself ’ for a tenner. The miserable
funeral dragged on for 1 hour 16min. 24 3-ssec., and when
it ended most people were snoring. Even Martin himself
was nearly asleep.
Ominous ! Cyclist Elliott brought his togs out
of the dressing-room and laid them upon the track every
time he raced last Saturday. Has cycling in Sydney reached
the respectability of pedestrianism—wherein you put
your togs down near the winning-post and then go back-
wards to your mark ?
Davidson, the Hillgrove cyclist, rode a great,
game race in the third heat of the Spring Handicap, and
got third while deserving first. Davidson, seemingly, began
cycling too late in life to have the all-necessary finishing
sprint.
Martin says that his hardest race up to date in
Australia was the ten-mile go in his match with Parsons.
He was in splendid buckle at the time, and that alone
brought him home.
O’Brien’s win of the Five Miles Scratch Race
from M'Comhe and Martin was a well-judged effort, but
possessed no remarkable merit because second and third
men had had their race taken out of them by previous
contests.
The triplet made a great bid for the mile record
(Parsons' 1.58 4-5, Adelaide) against the strong gale, and
missed £5 each by recording 1.59. The riders—Elliott,
Meadham and Martin—made the attempt of public in-
terest.
F. Eichler, who, with a start of 190yds., won
the £25 first prize in the Spring Handicap, is a thin youth
of some 40 summers.
When Bilinartin again appears upon the cycling-
path he will be one of a flock of Red Birds. The Yank
receives the best salary he has yet got in Aus. for joining
the new roost : ±8 a week.
* * * «
Martin did tremendous preparatory work for his
battle with M'Donell. He would run all the five miles
from his boarding-house to Coogee, have a sea-bath there
run all the way back and have a warm-bath ; lunch, and
wheel 25 miles in the afternoon.
* * * *
At last Megson has done something to make the
English Times and Sportsman pass him a casual compli-
ment. The ten-mile race, unpaced, suited Megson—a slow-
run race with a finish. He was never more than a two-
miler in Australia, and Parsons could kill him any day in
a paced ten-mile go.
* * * •
Billmartin, three hours after beating M'Donell,
stood treat to a group of cyclists, and absorbed half-a-
pint of English ale. “ That’s good,” remarked the Yank
as he put down the empty glass. And the tone of his
voice intimated that his dissipation consequent on his
victory began and ended with that one glass. “ Say,” he
remarked, “ I must get home to tea or the things will be
cold.” So, shouldering his bicycle, he left.
* * * *
The two most monotonous bits of sport seen
about Sydney for many a day were Gray’s 982 off the
balls jammed over the jaws of a pocket, in his match with
Memmott; and plugger Martin’s 25-mile race with his
fellow-countryman, M'Donell.

the wily Semite is to be found fairly sprinkled, and also
that the road-cyclists number him to a large extent, the
omission is ominous. There is one golden rule in life : do
what the Jews do and you won’t be far out. The wise
man should shun the racing-track as he would a viper

Sep. 18 was the 10th anniversary of Bill Beach’s
race with Gaudaur. This is generally considered to have
been the race of Beach's life ; and Beach now says that
both he and Gaudaur were, at the end, as weak as babies,
hardly able to shove their weightless shells through the
water. But this Herculean struggle did not gruel Beach
nearly so much as the contest on the Parramatta against
Rush, Laycock and Trickett. Nor did the much-quoted
race against Hanlan on the Nepean distress Beach
as much a,s it did Hanlan. Beach is now 46 years
old, and a little lighter than in his palmy days, “ through
hard-graft on the farm.” “ I’ve never felt any ill-effects
from my rowing,” he says.

Jt’s just this way. If Mr. Isaac Mosenstein,
who runs horses and makes a book and avowedly lives by
moment 1 oV dT a° SOratch a faVO1 ’ ite at the last
o Wen ° a . n £ h ] n S of that sort, the public says:

poses as a generous all-round sporting potentate, scratches
at the last moment, without overwhelming reasons, a
f wh ich he knows has been strongly backed by the
public, then the public is prima-facie justified in turning
‘™ d and paying:. “We took him to be an amateur
sportsman with aspirations to be in the James White and
W. R. Wilson category, and—well, he isn’t that sort.”
The horse-owner has two alternatives : one is the banner
earned by Mosenstein ; the other is the banner carried by
, son. Between those banners he must choose, and
whence makes his decision the public accept it once and
* * * *
alread y been some fairly bier wagering
over Melb Oup—Newhaven at 8 to 1 being a firm favorite?
doubtless as country money comes pouring in he will
shortly see half these odds. Miraculum is consistently
supported by the S.A. division, whilst good money is fol-
lowing. for Resolute, and several people who pose as
knowing are picking up all the thousands to fifty they
can secure about Hopscotch, who will run a far greater
horse than he did last year.
* * * *
Resolute did not win with such ease at Fleming-
ton last Saturday from the M.L. Bloodshot as to point to
his being a likely conqueror of Newhaven in the Derby.
The latter at w.f.a. simply smothered Hopscotch (fastest
milerin Australia) in Craven Plate (1J mile) in 2min. 9sec„
wbiist it took Resolute 2min. ll%sec. to shake off the
a? i•’ • I( ? rse ln em * Sept. Stakes over same distance.
Inis is how public form of these two cracks pans out at
present.
♦ * * *
Through Hopscotch taking on the Avoca instead
of Ascot Stakes last Saturday, and thus escaping* a penalty
for Gups, ’tis evident he is fancied ag-ain for these events
this year. At present a public favorite for Caulfield Cup,
it is likely that Melb. Cup will see him at his best with
the nice galloping weight of Bst. 71b.
* * * *
If Newhaven wins the Derby, bookies will get
the biggest shaking they have had for years, as they have
laid him with everything that has a chance for the Cup,
besides, in some cases, overlaying their Derby books
Luck (?) is seemingly always in their favor when things
appear deadest against them, and there are more unlikely
things than the handsome Sabretache coming to their
rescue in any case, Newhaven won’t win if the books can
block him.

Saturday’s last round of Vic. senior football
matches produced good games. Essendon v. Geeiong, the
best of the lot, was fast and at times exciting ; but Essen-
don, by kicking 4 goals and clever, concerted play, practi-
cally won the match in the second quarter. Towards the
finish Geelong rallied pluckily, but could not get level
with Essendon, who won Bg. 4b. (Waugh 3g.) to 4g 7b
Williamstown beat Carlton 6g. to 5g., Warren kicking 5
Williamstown goals; and Richmond, which finishes last
on the list, beat the erratic St. Ivilda twenty 7g. to 5g

PREMIER OINTMENT in the SOUTHERN
HEMISPHERE. But,, as ; many new arrivals
have lately made New South Wales their home, it
may be as well to let them know that there is such
an article as JOSEPHSON’S OINTMENT purely
tlieproductionof tliecolony, composed of wild plants
indigenous to the country and nowhere else, the
principal of which is the EUCALYPTUS, now
so famed thoroughout the world.

Dear Sirs, —I have tried your Joseph son’s Oint-
ment for Piles, and have found much relief from
using it. You are at liberty to use this if you feel
disposed.

Row’s Assorted Bitters
CONTAIN
Row’s Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRIf
CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.C.S., England.

Baron Berzilius’=
—■ Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronio
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D.:—The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of J3ile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in cases
of'habitual costiveness.
,D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB-I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening ; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Steane’s Bitters.
STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen: —
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows:
“ That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S JBITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,

All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs
and general weakness of the Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU’LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
gmmmmmKmmmmmmmmKmemanamsmammm-wKmmmaKfßMmasmmamm.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
take ROW’S STEANE’P WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
CAUTION . —When you call for these ask for
HOW’S, and take no substitute.

A TERRIBLE CASE OF

CURED BT
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs. E. Wyatt, of Port Road, West
Rindmarsh, So. Australia, writes of
the sad condition of her little daugh-
ter, whose portrait she also sends:
i
-
“My daughter was afflicted with
Eczema of the most aggravated
type. The disease first appeared in
eruptions on her head, then her hair
began to fail out, and in spite of
the best medical advice and treat-
ment she grew steadily worse. The
sores were full of matter and were
extremely offensive. Her eyes be-
came affected, and she was, in truth,
in a terrible state. My neighbors
were very sympathetic and took
great interest in the case. They
persuaded me to try Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla, and I am most thankful to
be able to say that this wonderful
medicine completely restored my
daughter’s health. She has now as
good a head of hair as anyone could
wish, her eyes are perfectly well,
and she is a fine girl of eight years
with every prospect of growing up
to be a strong and healthy woman.”

In a recent Hobart case, a man and his
wife were sued for the cost of maintaining their
children for eight years while they were too poor
to do so. The husband lately came into a lump of
money, and wouldn’t pay his mother (who had
kept the children) a penny. Her husband sued
him, and defendant’s counsel set up the defence
‘‘that there was no contract.” Verdict for plain-
tiff for full amount.
When it was thought that N.S.W. would

X.Z. : “ Apropos the St. Hilda camera-

Up to last week I had in my possession a beauti-
ful photo, of a cutter-yacht in full sail through a
bed of water-lilies on Melb. University lake.
The only curious points about that photo, were
that, as Melb. University lake is less than 100yds.
in its longest diameter, a cutter yacht could' not
sail on it at all, and that, as water-lilies have never
grown in said lake, no boat whatever could sail
through water-lilies on that lake. As a fact, the
photo, of the yacht was taken on Albert Park
lagoon, and the water-lilies in the Botanical
Gardens, and the lake on its own, and the three
negatives cleverly compounded. Now a photo, i
like that sets one thinking a lot about divorce- I
court evidence and private detective agencies and ]
accommodating collusiveness, and—and lots of other
things and possibilities better left undescribed. ”
The cableman is responsible for fostering
in Australians a conceit which is often mistaken
for patriotism. The Australee man is beset with
a desire to be “in ” everything. S.M. Herald
and other journals continually print cables of this
stamp: “News from Capetown states that trooper
Johnson, an Australian, has been killed in a
skirmish near Salisbury.” The headline, “An
Australian Killed,” looms large. This same John-
son, when in Australia, a mere unit in the sum
total, was probably quite an obscure individual.
Australia has hundreds of Johnsons —they are
almost as common as Smiths. But directly John-
son goes abroad he becomes a notable personage in
the cablegrapher’s eye, and the fact of his being
knocked on the head by niggers constitutes a most
important circumstance. Because— in him Aus-
tralia is represented; once more she is “in ” some-
thing which is going on. On the day of general
resurrection the Sheol News (which will, no
doubt, be edited by a Sydneyite) will contain a
par to the effect that “ Amongst the batch placed
on the Right Hand is Mr. Jones, an Australian.”

Forbes, in last Pall Mall Magazine,
alleges that the chums, Napoleon 111. and De
Morny, were the sons of Admiral Verhuel and
General Flahault, by the same mother, Hortense.
Louis Napoleon was not related to Nap. 1., unless
on the discredited hypothesis of sonship.
J. C. Firth, Auckland, prints an able little
pamphlet dealing with the cause and prevention
of fires on coal-ships. The cause, he thinks, is the
absorption of oxygen by small coal and slack, into
which the dumping system naturally converts a
portion of the large coal. And he might have
added that the shock of the fall gives direct heat,
which is retained or increased as successive trucks
are dumped into the hold. Mr. Firth’s means of
prevention is a “coal-distributor” fixed at different
points of the hold, but he omits to describe this
distributor exactly.

Premier Turner has a short, sharp way
with cormorants. A little while ago a military
officer grumbled at his horse allowance being
retrenched, and sent in a letter of complaint.
Turner wrote in the corner of the letter : “ If Col.
is not satisfied he had better resign.” Then
that officer did not “fire low,” but he “ lay low
and said nuffin ’’—officially.
Dear Bulletin. —Most N.S.W. District
Court Judges appear to greatly increase the pun-
ishment of a prisoner convicted after pleading
“not guilty” instead of owning-up. For instance :
I once saw a post-office official convicted of deliber-
ately opening the mail-bags and stealing letters.
He got 18 months but had fee’d a barrister.
Another man had obtained, when drunk, some extra
drink on the strength of letters purloined from his
pocket by the publican, who thought them valu-
able, and because he defended his case well and
created a little trouble he was weighed out two
years. Both first offences. But what I noticed
was that in the defence of the latter, a document
was rejected as evidence because it had not been
shown to prisoner ; yet he was convicted on the
evidence of another which he had not seen, and
when this was urged in his defence he was told
that if he chose he would be remanded for six
months till next sessions for the purpose of seeing
the document!—Scotty W.

The renewed allegation that “Oreswell,’’
confined in Parramatta Lunatic Asylum, is the
real Sir Roger Tichborne seems so probably true
that an interesting effort to prevent a full enquiry
into the case may be expected. The Tichborne
family in England, having, metaphorically speak-
ing, buried the missing Roger long ago, and
settled the estates on his nephew, don’t wish to
hear anything more of Creswell. He’s the
skeleton in their cupboard. The lunatic is un-
married, as far as anyone knows, therefore there
isn’t much “ conscience ” concerned in the matter,
for were his claim to the baronetcy proved lie
would merely be taken to England to gibber in
the presence of the Lord Chancellor; or some-
body, who would appoint the present holder of
the Tichborne title to take care of the demented
intruder and continue in practical posses-
sion of the property as before. Creswell,
if the genuine Roger, is but a dead letter
not wanted back at the ancestral ’all from
which he issued. Students of the long
Tichborne story will be disposed to believe that
Creswell is the Roger he declared himself to
Mr. Menzies, of Gundagai, presuming, of course,
that veteran Menzies is not imagining a fairytale.
The famous Tichborne Trial revealed a pretty
strong possibility of Roger having been in Aus-
tralia, despite the theory that the young man was
lost, with all hands, from aboard the ship Bella, |
and never got within these latitudes. If the 1
bloated Claimant hadn’t actually known Sir Roger
in Australia, lie had most likely known of him.
Since the trial and within recent years, every
new Ticlibbrnian statement has contained some
suspicion of reason for thinking that a real Aus- ,
tralian Roger existed under the name of Castro
(afterwards adopted by Orton), and disappeared j
suddenly. Any proof of Creswell having been 1
known as Castro at any time would tend to
thicken the plot considerably. [All the same, if
lunatic Creswell is merely to be shifted from an
Australian asylum to an English one, The Bulle-
tin wants to know if it’s mere disinterested en-
thusiasm which is moving the smart legal crowd
apparently at the back of the present agitation.
What do they expect to get out of it ?]

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is a pub. on the track every 15 miles. We
were “distinguished” travellers; wherefore at
every shanty and accommodation-house when we
sat down to feed if it wasn’t alleged ham and eggs
it was pork—with a dish of cream from goats’ milk
to follow. Hard mutton would sometimes have
been a welcome change. We said so once, and
sadly hurt the poor woman-drudge’s
“ And I thought I was givin’ them such a treat,”
she said, as she repeated her troubles to the un-
sympathetic boss—her boss, and the shanty’s. But
that is her story.
* * * *
They made things willing that night. Was
ever such cursing before ! And only hessian and
paper between them and us, and not paper every-
where. All in vain the boss tried to quieten them.
“ Gents inside—police—' disorderly shanty ’ —lose
my sanguinary licence,” we heard amid the roar-
ing and the clatter. “Gents be •! Here,
I’ll buy your bar.” That was conclusive.
The row started with an argument in the corner
about the Melb. Cup. Only two were engaged at
first, but others chipped in. There was some
alleged, but repudiated, reflection on a Sydney
horse; and the Victorian-born maligner had
eventually to fight for it. Not, of course, with the
man who had differed from him. He was fighting
a traveller who had come up to support him, and
who had suggested “plugging” as one way of
settling the dispute that really didn’t seem to
exist.
The riot became louder ; then scuffling, the deal
counter creaked, a crash, a thud or two, a fierce
oath, and somebody was being dragged outside.
Then silence so supreme that it was almost op-
pressive.
The boss locked up, and we turned over and
went to sleep, and so were late with the start in the
morning.
The city man moralised upon the row. What
depraved beings these fellows must be ! How
nearly mere brutes ! How lost to all sense of
decency and self-respect ! And all the rest.
* * * *
A sample track over the rabbit - desolated,
drought-stricken, wind-driven Western wilder-
ness. Miles of bare, baked country strewn with
quartz - pebbles, with struggling salt - bush in
clumps ; then miles of drifting sand.
Seven miles on, and there is a speck in the dis-
tance. A turkey or a man ? A quarter of a, mile
further—it’s a man. Another quarter —it’s a
swagman whom we are overtaking. Small specu-
lations employ the mind on a Western track.
The track bends to avoid a watercourse. In-
stead of turning to the left, to cut off the corner
the traveller leaves the track and keeps on to the
right. As we come up level with him he is a good
50yds. off.
“ G’-day, mate.”
“G’-day.” And with hardly a turn of the
head towards us he slogs on.
“ Have a wet ? ” And we held up the bottle.
He stops, hesitates. Evidently there is a fierce
argument proceeding within him. But the bottle
is still held up. He looks towards it again, and
surrenders. Before he moves, though, he puts his
slouch hat down over his left eye, and sidles
up to us, shamefaced and most obviously em-
barrassed.
He takes a gulj>.
“Here, go on —it’s dry walking. And —and you
look a bit brown.”
He winced ; and tried by a surreptitious tug at
the rim of his hat to pull it lower still. “Yes;
the sun’s warm,” he said.
“In trouble with your eye, eh?” This at a
guess, for we hadn’t seen it.
His awful secret was out.
“ Oh, nothin’ much. Just touched. You know
a chap called Ryan— Big Ryan,” with tremendous
emphasis on the “Big.” “It was him —Big Ryan.
Everybody knows him along this track —big Dave
Ryan.”
The hat was given another sly tug.
“ And he wasn’t so drunk as me. I’m only 9
stun 9, too. But he’s marked pretty strong, I
swear. . . . Thanks. It’s six miles to the
next, ain’t it—Mrs. Burke’s. But I’ll go round it
—there’s a back track, ain’t there ? ”
We knew why he would go round Mrs. Burke’s :
he had met Big Ryan.
“ Lost to all sense of decency and self-respect!
I echoed.
P.
Her Little Part.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ I enter in the second act;
My name is on the bill ;
Do come.” I kissed her—that’s a fact—
And promptly vowed “ I will! ”
For she had won my beating heart
On short acquaintance, so
To see the darling play her part
I really meant to go.
A melodrama, hot and strong,
Was running at the time ;
The villain, in an ulster long,
Went revelling in crime.
The hero early came to grief—
Exactly as I’d feared—
And all the time the real thief
Struck attitudes, and sneered.
Act number two then hove in sight—
A drawing-room the “set.”
The heroine —tall, wan, and white
Sat nursing her regret.
And through the muliioned windows streamed
The limelight of the moon.
’Tvvas Mary’s scene ! I fondly dreamed
I’d see her acting soon.
Of course, I’d read the programme down
To find her honored name ;
And Mary was Miss Mildred Browne —
My girl, the very same !
I sat and waited, blushing deep,
For Mary to occur,
The heroine might weep and weep,
I didn’t think of her.
At last we heard a gentle tap—
“ Come in,” the weeper said.
She entered. Such a saucy cap
Upon her saucy head,
Dove-colored dress, an apron smart —
A charming servant's rig.
When Mary came to play her part
I felt it must be big.
She spoke. Ye gods ! a thrilling line,
In parlor-maiclish tone,
And went away ; her form divine
Was altogether gone.
She ne’er returned ; she’d finished quite ;
Six precious words—no more —
Spoke Mary to her mistress white :
“ The cab is at the door.”
EDMUND FISHER.
In a Restaurant.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The waiter was listlessly wiping down the tables
and incidentally flicking off the flies that buzzed
around the sugar-bowls. I was the only customer
left in the cheap eating-house, and was just sum-
moning up energy to face the glare and dust out-
side when my attention was arrested by the en-
trance of a young couple who sat down at the
table next to mine.
“ What will you have, Steve ? ” said the young
woman, who was obviously excited.
“ Anything ! Oh, all right; two cups of tea and
some muffins, waiter, please.”
After the waiter had attended to them the
woman bent towards her eompin on, who was
resting his head on his hands : “ Where have you
been these last three months, Steve? I —l didn t
think you would desert me like that.”
The young man wearily raised his head and
looked furtively at her.
“ You’d never have seen me again, if we hadn’t
met accidentally. I’m a miserable dog— doctor
says I can’t last more than six months. Lost my
billet through being so sick —and —and —I’ve been
too damned miserable to speak to anybody.”
He finished with a sob, and began nervously
plucking at the table cloth.
I saw the color come back into the woman’s
face.
“Thank Heaven, Steve, what a relief ! ”
The man started to his feet, his pain-lined face
flushing pitifully.
“ Good God ! —what have you to be glad about ? >
“ Oh, I thought it was —another girl.”
“ONLY.”
Both Adelaide dailies are supplying type-
writers to their reporters, and the linotype, which

W. S. Dowell announces that he is a can-
didate for a seat in the Federal Council. When
he stood for N.S.W. Parliament, he said he' did so
at the instigation of John E. Redmond, who hap-
pened about that time to knock against him in
the backblocks. At whose instigation does his
political ambition now assert itself ?
S.A. telegraph - operators, despite the
large profits reaped by Govt, out of the W.A.
boom, are disgracefully underpaid. Several clerks,
although with a service of 15 and 16 years, get
only <£loo a year. Vacancies have not been filled
for over five years, and officials are consequently
overworked as well as sweated.
Visitors to the new Bulletin office are
hereby cautioned to take no heed of the de-
moniacal yells that may be shortly expected in
that establishment. Nurtured in the comparative
quiet of Pitt-street, the staff is fast developing
the “ George-street Voice.” As a sounding board,
the wood-blocked roadway is a distinct success—
the rumble of each bus is louder than a locomo-
tive—and the place is unequalled for voice-pro-
duction. Nature, which always strives to adapt
creatures to their surroundings, is developing a
wood-block speech, a blend of the bull’s bellow
and the midnight howl of the dingo that will not
be comforted.
Snipped from a two-column article by Mr.
Harry Foran, who badly wants to get into
N.S. W. Assembly:—
In this manner, by the exchange of a few commonplace
observations, several Catholic and Protestant petty trades-
men are despoiled of their legitimate profits by oily-
gammony, snivelling Masonic fiends incarnate, who are
sweet as honey to an honest man’s face, and perfidious,
profane, and plebian (sic) behind his back —because they
cannot raise their filth-clogged minds to higher things, as
any pot-house larrikin, who, to prove by an ebullition of
the vilest Billingsgate that ever emanated from the slaver-
ing lips of semi-demented mortality, that the white man
in his degradation, whether hidden or palpable, is inferior
in manners and in morals to the most degenerate cave-
man in the untrodden wilds of Africa.
And H. Foran talks in public like that—only
worse. For there are no adjectives to speak of in
the foregoing.
Orator Fleming and the Yarra-Bankers
are to have an addition to their banners in the
shape of a full-length picture of an Australian
swagman on a pedestal inscribed “ The Dispos-
sessed.” The artist is J. M‘Donald, an enthusias-
tic and hard-working Single-Taxer. He has also
worked into the new banner a verse from Sydney
Jephcott’s powerful “Hymn for the Dispossessed”
which first appeared in Queensland Worker, and
has been re-printed over and over again through
Australia. By the way, has marriage quite
bound the “ sweet influences ” that formerly
swayed the Wild Man of Tintaldra?
Vic. Barrister Fisher makes a very serious
statement in a series of articles on criminal
administration which he is writing in a Melb.
paper. Referring to the fiasco of the recent trial
of a chemist at Gt long, he practically says “ that
a presentriient in quite other lines could have been
readily framed, with this advantage that no refer-
ence to any superior judgment would have been
specially required.” Why wasn’t such a present-
ment framed, and, if it could have been framed,
why go through the present farce of amending a
defect in the law which only exists in the imagina-
tion of those responsible for the defective framing
of the presentment before the Geelong court ?
Fisher is a barrister of long experience in technical
criminal matters and can point to as long a series
of successful appeals as any man at the Vic. bar,
and accordingly it is unlikely that he would make
such a serious statement without good grounds.
The statement deserves investigation, for if it is as
he says the competency of the Crown Law de-
partment is at issue.
Hobart Clipper, which lately was con-
demned to pay £lOO for remarks about the morals
of a local M.P., has asked the public to assist it to

A Murray steamer captain the other day
received this screed :—“ Plese sir, if you have one
hemte car A seen tin plese send it to me.” Also,
the writer’s name was where the address should
be, and the address occupied the signature’s usual
site.
The pathos of legal tomfoolery. A Queen’s
Counsel, being an officer of the Crown, must,
before he takes a case against the Crown, obtain a
permit,' price 10s. 6d., from the Crown Law Office.
A permit to argue against his oath ! Price,
10s. 6d.
One of the inducements held out to the
Kanaka dubious of emigrating to Q. is alleged to
be the promise of “ plenty white Mary,” and it is
said that indecent photos, of happy Kanakas and
white Marys are shown to the innocent islander
with the aid of the magic lantern.
Now that several Australian newspaper-
proprietaries, with Christmas in their eye, are
bidding for the work of the green author in town
and country, the following scheme, successfully
tried not very long ago —in England should
interest most competitors. The proprietary began
by having a story —a little thing of its own to
start.with. Then it offered wealth—say, anything
from*2os. to <£loo—for the best Christmas story of
a certain length, and added the condition : “All
stories sent in become the property of the pro-
prietary, to be used as the proprietary likes.” The
outcome of all of which was that the proprietary
pronounced its own little thing the prize-winner,
and had something like 500 gratis manuscript
stories to read and print at its leisure.
“ To see what is before our eyes is almost
to have genius.”
“The name Westralia (a Bulletin crea-
tion) should be changed to ‘ Tinland.’ Everything
is tinned—meat, jam, fruit, eggs, water, soup,
sugar, tea, and condiments. The very politicians
are tin men, and the leading paper is the Bulle-
tin.” This from a subscriber, evidently in arrear.
Lane’s Cosnffi colony has now ninety in-
habitants all told—49 men, 17 women, and 24
children. Lane proposes a crusade through the
U.K. to gather in spinsters for his bachelor citi-
zens. And most likely he’ll get them, for the spin-
ster wedding-seeker careth not a whit for worms
that burrow into her feet and ears and nostrils.
At Fremantle (W.A.), a number of carters
recently struck against a wage of 365. for a week
of 56 hours, and their places were .rushed on the.
instant by an indefinite number of new applicants.
Six shillings a day in a town where meat costs Bd.
and butter Is. sd.' per lb., and the rent of a small

The inmates of Melb. Benevolent Asylum
have signed a round robin protesting against the
“ unpalatable and unconstitutional flavor ” of the
pea-soup supplied there. “ Unconstitutional
flavor ” in this connection is an excellent phrase.
There is a ring of tine old Conservatism in it, and
Conservatism in pea-scup is not at all out of place.
According to N.Y. Tribune, Capt. Evans,
of the Yankee warship Indiana, was so anxious to
test his ship and guns that he sought President
Cleveland a while ago and remarked: “ Look
hyar, sir ! .Tist gimme a chance In Cuba with my
battleship, and no language but Spanish will be
spoken in Hell for the next five years ! ”
Last Contemporary writes of co-operation
in Italy. The Govt, discourages the middleman,
and encourages laborers and other unskilled work-
men, to take its contracts direct. One association
of such has 2000 members and £2OOO reserve-fund,
after working eight years, besides more than
doubling the wages and never having had an
accident.
Kaiser William seems to have impressed
the cablegrammer by his extraordinary display of
courage in a railway collision. It was just a
gentle collision between Bill’s special train and an
“ express ” which had, evidently, slowed down to
a crawl; no one in either train was any the worse
for the accident, and yet “ the Kaiser remained
quite cool and composed.” Perhaps he thought
he was a corpse.

ONE ASPECT OF THE CLUB-DOCTOR QUESTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Ancl—Macrossan ! ”
The younger man turned at the door, went back
to the bedside, and stooped his ear. “Yes,” he
said. “ Anything more ? ”
Dr. Mildwater’s answer didn’t come at once.
He was studying the face of his locum tenens. His
own eyes, brown and gentle, were weary with 40
years of work in a profession so congested that
ability will never spell success without the push
or the luck—one of which Mildwater had lacked
by constitution, the other by circumstance.
The face he looked at told a different tale, for
the eyes, blue and small, were bright with surplus
vitality; and, while the upper head said “brains,”
the broad and well-projected jaw spoke plainly of
that animal energy which is at least as great a
factor of efficiency, and which would surely send
this man to the front—unless irascibility should
bar the way. For the reddish, over-bushy eye-
brows had a swift contractile trick that had
already, at 27, scored two deep vertical wrinkles
between them; the strong hair bristled over the
forehead; the moustache was rugged from much
gnawing. Even now, at what might be the death-
bed of a man lie revered and liked, Dr. Macros-
san’s brusquerie peeped out.
“ What is it ?—what is it, Mildwater ? There’s
a lot to do, you know, and— ”
“ Only this,” the sick man interrupted, with a
curious air of deprecation. “You’ve never done
any club work, have you ? ”
“ No ; but, of course, I’ll take yours.”
“ Well, you see, you’re a bit hasty, Macrossan—
and these club people are very exacting. ”
Macrossan straightened himself up grimly.
“Ay ; I know ! Ring you up at midnight for a
pricked finger. ‘ Get the worth of our money out
of the fellow,’ and so on. I’ve heard all about it.
And, excuse me, Mildwater, but it’s easy-going
chaps like you who spoil these people. Here you
are -brains, experience, sympathy, refinement—
everything, in a word, that goes to make the
superior animal, and you submit like a lamb to be
instructed—instructed, begad !—by a lot of paltry
little things-in-office that— — however, just let ’em
try it with John Macrossan ! ”
Here the fierce eye, falling suddenly upon the
languid sick one, followed the gaze to a picture on
the other side of the room—the photograph, appar-
ently, of a mother and three daughters. Macros-
san pulled himself up.
“ Forgive me, old man. I’m an inconsiderate
beast to forget that it’s for the sake of others you
put up with such degradation. Well, don’t trouble
about me ; I’ll keep myself well in hand. I’ll be a
very Job for patience with ’em. Don’t let him
talk, Miss Burns” —to the nurse—“and table-
spoonful every hour, you know. That’s all, at
present.”
* * * *
He squeezed the sick man’s hand and ran down-
stairs—Hotspur cast for the part of Job ! —just as
a tremendous bell-peal heralded the advent of a
huge, unwieldy woman whose little turned-up
nose was ludicrously out of keeping with the
otherwise massive style of her architecture. But
it was the nose of shallow insolence, and there
was a covert insult in the way the woman looked
to every corner of the room before she began, in-
quiringly ;
“ Doctor ? ”
“ Macrossan, madam, at your service. Dr.
Mildwater is ill. Be seated.”
The flesh-mountain sank upon a chair that
uttered a protesting creak, and the impudent nose
sniffed suspiciously half-a-dozen times before the
mouth said:
“Sick, is he? And you take his place ?—with
the club, I mean ! ”
“ With the Amalgamated Archers—yes !
“You’re only a young feller”—the woman
slowly extracted the club-card from her pocket—
“ Dr. Mildwater might be your father ! ”
“The atrocious crime of being a young man!
quoted Macrossan, mentally— then aloud, “You
didn’t come here to supply me with that informa-
tion, I presume.”
The lady’s carrot-red face went beet-root colour.
“No,” she said, “I come ’eie for medikkle advice
— and civility ! ”
Macrossan ignored the insinuation. “What is
your trouble, madam ? ” was all he said, and the
elephantine Archeress, finding bluff was of no use,
launched out upon a sea of detail that would have
been shoreless but for Macrossan’s questions.
“ Thank you,” he said after a couple of minutes,
“ that will do; I think I know what’s the
matter. ”
The woman’s color and her impudence dis-
appeared together, as Macrossan pulled paper
towards him and began to write.
“ Gh, Lor’, doctor '.—not dropsy ? Don’t say it’s
dropsy ! ”
“ Dropsy ?—no ! A carminative’s all you want. ”
“ Carminative? ” she repeated, pleased with the
word’s imposing sound. “What kind of a thing
is that, doctor ? ”
“ In this case”—Macrossan handed her the pre-
scription—“ it’s peppermint,” he was going to
say, but an instinct warned him. “ It’s oleum
pipermenthce,” he substituted sonorously, and the
flatulent giantess was departing satisfied, when,
upon the front steps, only her enormous avoir-
dupois saved her from being knocked heels-over-
head by a wild-haired woman, rushing frantically
up with a squalling urchin under her arm, despera-
tion in her face.
* * * *
“ Where's the docthor ? ” gasped the newcomer
—fairly rushing the astonished Jenkins before her
into the consulting-room, and letting her jaw drop
as the unfamiliar figure met her eye. “ The
docthor ! ” she cried again. “ Docthor Mild-
wather, for the love of God ! ”
Her wild excitement made Macrossan think
there was no time to be lost. He stepped over
and took from her the screeching child—a boy of
five, or so.
“lama doctor. What is it ? where’s he hurt ? ”
The woman whipped off the youngster’s upper
garments. “’Tis here, docthor. Sure, it’s ivery
rib of urn’s broke—falling off of the fince forninst
me oan two eyes ?”
Macrossan stared. “Is that all ? ” —pointing to
a small bruise upon the urchin’s ribs.
“All?” repeated the mother, fiercely. “An
isn’t it enough, too ?—to have me little Mickey
knocked into”——
“ That’ll do ! There’s nothing that a little
arnica won’t set right in a couple of days. Take
him away ! ”
Macrossan sat down to his desk; Jenkins opened
the door ; the Hibernian matron walked stupidly
towards it, then wheeled suddenly around.
“ Ar-r-nikky ! ” she repeated, with a howl that
scared her blubbering offspring into silence. “ I
bring ye me unfortnit clxoild, half-kilt, an’ ’tis
armikky ye talks about. Bekase ’tis only a club-
job, I suppoase; but, be me sowl ! ’tis ould Mild-
wather that’ll hear of this, as sure as me nem’s
Hourigan ! ’Twon’t be the first toime the club’s
put him through his faein’s, ayther !”
Macrossan, with a great constraint upon himself,
never turned his head; Jenkins imperturbably
waited ; and the irate Madame Hourigan, for want
of an antagonist, was fain to go snorting away.
* * * «
Macrossan went upstairs, and found Mrs. Mild-
water with her husband—rapidly getting worse,
as the other saw at a glance. But he forced
cheerfulness into his face, as he forced a pious lie
to his tongue.
“ He’ll do well enough, Mrs. Mildwater, I
haven’t the least doubt; but, just as a matter of
form, you know, I’d send for Irving and Vas-
chetto. ”
He ran down-stairs —sent the message—and was
looking up the list of visits for next day, when
“ tingle-tingle ” roused him again for the fray.
A married couple, this time. Frail little squeak-
ing v>oman ; big-nosed, hollow-voiced, “ better-
days ” kind of husband—just descending, as
Macrossan saw in a moment, from a pretty tall
jamboree. But at least he was civil.
“Dr. Mildew—Mildwater, I mean—is, regret
to learn, indisposed. Do I speak to his—ah—
temporary representative ? ”
“You do, sir,” Macrossan answered—sorely
puzzled, the while, by the incomprehensible nods
and becks with which, behind her husband’s back,
the snipy little woman accompanied the incontro-
vertible proposition that “ doctors are but mortal,
after all, sir ! ”
Her husband, without molting round, sup-
pressed her with a waving hand, and intimated
with increasing stateliness that he “ apprehended
he was suffering from haemoptysis.”
“ What the deuce have we got here ?” thought
Macrossan, before he said, “ Indeed ! you don’t
look it. When was your last attack ? ”
“ This morning, sir ; early this morning.
“Ha ! Vomiting, hadn’t you been?”
“Well—er”—hesitated the man—while the
woman, with accelerated pantomime, signified her
approval of this line of examination —“ In point
of fact, I—er—had.”
“ Exactly ! ” Macrossan put down the stethos-
cope he had taken up—walked round the fellow-
punched him here and there about the solid
frigate-built chest.
“ You’ve no pulmonary haemorrhage, sir. And,
if you took less whisky, you wouldn’t bave to
retch in the mornings until you bring blood from
some small vessel about the stomach.”
“Ah! slight haemateinesis ” —rolling this still
longer word with a larger enjoyment. “ Your
diagnosis, sir, agrees with Dr. Mild water’s. ”
“ Mildwater? You have already consulted him
about it, then ? ”
“ To be sure, sir,” squeaked the wife, unable
longer to contain herself. “Every time he goes
and makes a beast of himself he gets this notion
into his head, and he comes and pesters the life out
of Dr. Mildwater about it.”
“An expensive crotchet,” Macrossan was going
to say, when suddenly a light came to him. “ Is
this a club-matter?” he asked. “Are you an
Amalgamated Archer ? ”
“ I have—er—that honor,” said the stalwart in-
valid.
“I see! Well, I have the honor to wish you
good-afternoon and a lot less whisky.”
* * * *
The summoned specialists looked grave
over their prostrate professional brother, and
Macrossan reproached himself with not having
called them earlier.
Dr. Irving shook his head. “It would have
made little difference, I think, Vaschetto ? ”
“ None. He will not see another 20 hours.”
He did not see ten. At half-past three in the
morning—half-an-hour after Macrossan had at-
tended an urgent call, and while a hundred human
drones were gambolling idiotically in a neighbor-
ing ball-room—the noble life of ill-rewarded use-
fulness went out with the ebb-tide.
* » * *
Alcoholic epilepsy, Macrossan judged it to
be, for the patient, a burly stonemason, was
having another fit as the doctor entered the house.
Macrossan freed the neck, got something between
the teeth, made a few inquiries, and sat down to
prescribe.
“ If your husband would keep clear of grog,” he
said to the sharp-faced, shrill-voiced wife, “he’d
be no more liable to fits than I am. Otherwise,
the thing will probably get chronic and knock
him out, sooner or later. Put a jar of hot-water
to his feet, give him a dose of castor-oil, and get
this made up as soon as the chemists are open.
Good night—or, rather, good morning ! ”
The woman stepped between him and the door.
“Are you the club-doctor, or are you not ? ” she
said, significantly.
“Yes. At least, I’m acting for Dr. Mildwater.
He’s very ill, you know.”
“ I don’t know. But, if he is, you’re the club
doctor in the meantime ; and what I want to know
is, what do we pay you for? Jest t’come an’take
’alf a look, an’ clear out again ? My word, no ! ”
The oath which got as far as Macrossan’s tongue
was stopped there by his promise to Mildwater.
“My good woman,” he forced himself to say,
quietly, “ there’s nothing more to be done. Give
him the oil, and get the prescription made up as
soon as you can. I’ll look round again in the
afternoon. ”
“ I dessay ! ” the woman shrilled after him.
“ In the aft’noon, when you’ve got through with
the guinea-a-piece toffs. But the club ’ll show
you— ”
The cab drove off.
* *
“None of my club tyrants, as yet!”
thought Macrossan next day, as he snatched a
flying lunch. “ Just as well, too. Now that poor
Mild water’s gone, I don’t feel disposed to play Job
any longer.”
“ Person in the consulting-room, sir ! ”
Macrossan bolted the remainder of his chop, and
went.
The person—big and bony, long-lipped and
surly-eyed—received the doctor with a surprised
scowl. “ Who are you ? ” lie said.
“ Dr. Macrossan.”
“ Dr. Mildwater, 1 want ! ’
“You can’t see him,” Macrossan returned,
curtly, chafed by the man’s churlishness.
“ I can see him ! —and I will see him ! Where
is he ? ”
“You cannot see him, I tell you. I’m acting
for him ; what can I do for you?”
“ You ? ” —with a contemptuous snigger. “ Oh,
you can do nothing for me. Dr. Mildwater’s my
man.”
Macrossan got suddenly upon his feet, “You
Delong to the Archers, I suppose ? ”
“Suppose what you like !—except that you’re
going to get me out of here before I’ve seen Dr.
Mildwater. I don’t have anything to do with
understrappers ! ”
Along Macrossan’s nerves .eaped the lightning
tingle familiar to every fiery-tempered man with
the brake on. But in his voice was only gentle
resignation.
“ Well, friend—since you insist —you shall see
Dr. Mildwater. Step this way.”
The other followed sullenly—along the passage—
up the stairs—to a room into which the city noises
and the midday light came. Both more faintly
for the lowered blinds that combined with an in-
definite, drug-like odor to make the stranger
vaguely uneasy. Inside the door he halted, till
Macrossan beckoned him over to the bed, on which
a sheet lay loosely to the long, irregular outline of
the something it concealed.
“ You have insisted upon seeing Dr. Mild-
water,” Macrossan grasped the man’s arm with
one hand, as with the other he suddenly flung
back the sheet from the grey, death-frozen
features—“behold him !”
The other, with a face as livid as a corpse’s,
turned hastily away, and Macrossan followed,
with an incandescent eye.
“ Dr. Mild water is dead ’’—harshly, in the visi-
tor’s ear as they went down the stairs. “ You
killed him ! ” savagely, as they got to the bottom.
“What?” The stranger turned and took a
fresh grasp of his stick.
In an instant it was wrenched from his hand.
“ You killed him, I say ! You and the selfish,
ignorant hogs like you, who think the paltry pit-
tance of your tin-pot club should buy the body
and the soul of the man whom poverty compels t'o
take it! ”
“Look here, young man,” the other was com-
mencing, pompously, when the doctor—his pent-
up wrath escaping with a burst —gripped him
fiercely by the neck.
“ Open the door, Jenkins ! ”
The wondering Jenkins opened, and to the
passers-by appeared suddenly the spectacle of a
large, demoralised person propelled so violently
down the steps as first to touch the side-walk with
his nose, to the exceeding damage of that liberally-
designed organ. After him flew a hat and stick,
the door slammed-to, and the show, to the chagrin
of the rapidly-assembling gapers, was over in one
act.
* * * *
Macrossan paid his fine without a word.
The true inwardness of the matter was not for the
extensive ears of the sage who upon that occasion
adorned the bench. But when—as sometimes
happens—Macrossan meets a man who doesn’t
think with his elbows, he is willing enough to give
the esoteric history of the famous “ Unprovoked
Assault by a Medical Man ! ”
ALEX, MONTGONERY.
To get rid of sparrows in the Ararat dis-
trict, Vic., they mix crushed wheat with plaster
of Paris and a little flour and sugar, and place the
mixture on a special bait-board out of the reach of
fowls and other farm-yard animals. The sparrows
go for it freely, and in two days die of intestinal
obstruction. This delay in the death time mysti-
fies the survivors, and they don’t connect their
mates’ death with the mixture, but go on suiciding
joyously.
Apropos the woman who went into a Melb.
shop the other day, and, remarking “I am going
to die here,” took out a razor and cut her throat:
a few years ago a well-dressed man went into a
barber’s shop in Castlereagh-street, Sydney, and
asked the attendant if he might be permitted to
shave himself on the usual terms. “Certainly.”
Razor, brush and soap having been handed him,,
he carefully lathered nis chin, tried the temper of
the razor, went to the basin in the corner, and,
holding his head well over, cut his throat effectu-
ally.
A well-known American professor, H. C.
Wood, feeling the necessity for a better description
of the effects of Indian hemp (Arabic, hashish;
Hindustani, bhang or siddhi), experimented on
himself recently. A few hours after taking, he
was writing a prescription, when he became per-
fectly oblivious to surrounding objects. He lest
the power of time-measurement; and apologised
for keeping the messenger waiting so many hours
(it had really only been minutes). He went home
in a state of ecstatic happiness, and there laughed
continuously, made comic gestures, played an
imaginary fiddle, and did burlesque dances. After
half-an-hour of this a change set in; he became
uneasy ; his limbs were numb; he walked con-
stantly and aimlessly about the house ; his mouth
and throat became painfully dry. Next, he got to
imagine his legs were not part of his body. An
undefined horrible fear, as of impending death,
came over him. When put to bed, he felt himself
mounting upward and expanding till he filled all
space. “I have never,” he says, “experienced
anything like the fearful sense of almost hopeless
anguish and utter weariness that was upon me.”
Trembling, muscular weakness, a ravenous appe-
tite, and general depression followed.

Mo one to look to-day at Miss Sophie Kiefer, a pretty and stylish young belle,
whose portrait is given above, and who lives at the northwest corner of Fourth ana
Queen streets, Philadelphia, would imagine that she had ever been in anything but
the pink of health. Her skin is clear and creamy, her teeth are white and even, she
has luxuriant dark hair, and her eyes are large and bright, of a lustrous brown. Yet,
notwithstanding Miss Kiefer’s splendid appearance, only a year ago she was m
extremely poor health, and her blood was in a very bad condition. Miss Kiefer s
story is best told in her own words :
“ When I began to take Ayer’s Sarsaparilla I was not only run oown, but I was
thoroughly discouraged. Doctors and proprietary medicines both failed to help me.
My blood was disordered. But the first bottle of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla helped me so
much that I decided to keep it up, and did so. Then inside of a month, I began to
think that the Sarsaparilla was a wonder. It cleared my skin completely and restored
my appetite to its former condition. My general health was recovered and the third
bottle removed every appearance of disorder from my blood. Not only that, but it
left me better than ever. For several months I had been ill and complaining. My
health in general, aside from the condition of my blood, was very poor. I remember
one day, after attending a ball the night before, when I felt so miserable that I was
afraid I was going to die, almost. My appearance, of which I always took considera-
ble care, was the" thing that worried me most of all , I will acknowledge. But as I
tell you, Ayer’s Sarsaparilla rejuvenated me. I would take it any time in preference
to toilet preparations and skin soaps and wasnes, for it worked wondeis with me. I
can recommend Ayer’s Sarsaparilla to anyone whose blood is poor or whose general
health is unsatisfactory.”
