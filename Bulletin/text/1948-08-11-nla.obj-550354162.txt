JpEW parts of Britain’s 5000 miles of
coastline have greater historical in-
terest than the popular Kentish seaside
resort of Deal and its environs. Here
Briton and Roman, Saxon and Dane and
Norman have successively fought; and
here, as World War II has conclusively
proved, the possibility of invasion by sea
and air can never long be absent from
the minds of those responsible for the
guardianship of the “white walls of
England.”
In 1495 the Pretender, Perkin Warbeck,
the “White Rose of England,” landed
170 men at Deal. They were captured
by the trained bands of Sandwich and
subsequently chained two by two and
executed, their bodies being suspended
on gibbets along the coast of Kent and
Sussex as a warning to other invaders.
In 1540, as part of his great scheme of
coast defence, Henry VIII erected Deal
Castle, together with the castles of
Walmer and Sandown, which were con-
trolled by the Lord Warden of the
Cinque Ports. Deal Castle is circular in
form, with four massive stone bastions
pierced by fifty-two portholes. The walls
of the bastions are about twenty feet
. thick at the foundations, diminishing to
about eleven feet at the summit. The
entrance over a moat, shown above, is
on the landward side of the castle.
Shortly after the completion of the
castle Anne of Cleves landed at Deal on
her way to be married to Henry VIII. In
1573 Queen Elizabeth visited the fortress
during her progress from Dover to
Sandwich.
Deal Castle is also noted for the many
prominent people who have resided there.
In 1925 the Earl of Ypres was its Cap-
tain ; Lord Herschell, Lord Allenby, the
Marquess of Reading and Field-Marshal
Lord Birdwood of Anzac have all been
Captains of Deal Castle.
A series 'of naval battles between the
English and the Dutch were fought in the
Downs, the famous roadstead off Deal,
between the deadly Goodwin Sands and
the coast, during the years 1652-55. They
resulted in the eventual defeat and death
of the Dutch Admiral Van Tromp by the
English under Blake and Monk.

SHAKSPEARE'S RHYTHMS.
Salvador Madariaga’s On Hamlet
(R.P. 28/7/’4B) contained —along with
some good sense —much doubtful theoris-
ing, but at least it served the purpose of
drawing attention to the play. After re-
reading it I am tempted to air a theory
of my own ; which is that Shakspeare
wrote about twice as much poetry as we
have given him credit for.
It has always struck me as astonishing
that the richest and loveliest passage in
the whole of “Hamlet” —far deeper than
the picture of Ophelia’s death if not so
decorative —is not in verse but in prose:
This most excellent canopy, the air, look
you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this
majestical roof fretted with golden fire —
why it appears no other thing to me than
a foul and pestilent congregation of
vapours. What a piece of work is man!
how noble in reason
“This majestical roof fretted with
golden fire”—that was the phrase which,
most of all, seemed too profoundly
beautiful to be placed in the category of
prose. It has the music and the imagery
of poetry; it is in the mood of poetry.
It is poetry in everything but scansion.
But, then, would it not scan? Say it
as you will, you cannot make a correct
iambic pentameter out of it; and yet,
say it aloud, and it does sound remark-
ably like a line of poetry. And so, in
fact, it is. It does not contain five correct
iambic feet, yet it does contain five
“beats,” five “strong” syllables. The
natural accents, when the line is spoken
aloud, fall upon “jest,” “roof,” “fret,”
“gold” and “fire.”
There is a famous line of Webster’s
from The Duchess of Malfi —“Cover her
face, mine eyes dazzle: she died young”
—which also is always set out as prose
and, as far as I know, has not been
claimed to be poetry. But I have always
thought that it could be set out as verse:
Cover her face, mine eyes dazzle: she died
Young—
justifying the abrupt turnover into the
second line by the moving emphasis it
places on “young”; and Shakspeare’s
line, with only a couple of anapaests in-
stead of Webster’s spondee to modify
the flow of iambics, is jcloser still to a
correct pentameter. Many lines just as
loose as
This majestical roof fretted with golden fire
can, in fact, be found among the passages
of “Hamlet” that are set out as verse.
Such a line is “loose” only if we de-
mand a correct iambic pentameter when-
ever a line of five stresses is used. If we
scan it by the method of “Piers Plow-
man” and of Chaucer, used in more
recent times by Hopkins, Bridges, Chris-
topher Brennan and Eliot —a measure of
five beats in which the unstressed syllables
are disregarded—the line is correct.
If one phrase of Shakspeare’s “prose”
can thus be held to be a line of poetry,
what about the rest of it? Is the whole
of this most beautiful speech of Hamlet’s
really poetry? I think it is. Disregard
the unstressed syllables and it falls
naturally, if roughly, into lines of five
stresses:
I have of late —but wherefore I know not —
Lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of
exercises;
And indeed, it goes so heavily with my dis-
position
That this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me
A sterile promontory; this most excellent
canopy,
The air, look you, this brave o’erhanging
firmament,
This majestical roof fretted with golden fire —
Why, it appears no other thing to me
Than a foul and pestilent congregation of
vapours.
What a piece of work is man! How noble
in reason!
How infinite in faculties! in form and moving.
How express and admirable! in action how like
an angel!
In apprehension, how like a god!
The beauty of the world! the paragon of
animals!
And ye*, to me, what is this quintessence of
dust?
Man delights not me; no, nor woman
Neither, though by your smiling you seem to
say so.
Why, if he was really writing poetry
here, did Shakspeare set it out as prose,
as we may assume he did? His difficulty
lay partly, no doubt, in the words of
three or four syllables—“promontory,”
“canopy” and the like. Hamlet had to
say such words if he was to speak in
character, for he was not one of Heming-
way’s, oxen, whose vocabulary is limited
to monosyllables. But polysyllables are
the very devil to handle in correct verse.
In speech we slur them ; we accent the
first syllable of, say, “firmament” and get
rid of the rest of it in as quick a mumble
as we can manage. In a system of scan-
sion that counts only stressed syllables,
“firmament” would be regarded as if it
were simply “firm” ; “promontory” and
“canopy,” for metrical purposes, are
“prom” and “can.” But Shakspeare,
though always with some minor modifica-
tions, wrote his verse in the correct
iambic measure of his day and followed
the practice of counting all syllables and
of giving the same weight to minor as to
major stresses in a polysyllable. Whereas
in natural speech, and in a scansion
founded on it, “apprehension” would
make two metrical beats, the accents
falling on “ap” and “hen,” the Eliza-
bethan practice would havp made three
beats of it, placing an additional accent
on the final syllable: as, to keep the pat-
tern of five stresses a line, I have had
to scan it in the quotation.
To have submitted “promontory,”
“majestical” or “animals” as single beats
would have made the verse look too far
removed from correct iambics to be
accepted by Shakspeare’s contempor-
aries ; it was too far removed from
correctness, perhaps, for Shakspeare him-
self to wish to present it or justify it is
verse. So ha left it as prose.
And yet, that was a very odd thing to
do. For Hamlet’s speech is not one of
those patches of commonplace dialogue
where, in a poetic drama, one would ex-
pect the verse to drop naturally into
prose. It is, on the contrary, one of the
most moving, one of the most dramatic,
one of the most essentially poetic
speeches in the entire play. Shakspeare
must have felt that if was “right” ; and
that to mould it into correct iambic
verse, as he easily could have, would
have marred it.
“Right,” the speech certainly was. It
is Hamlet speaking in character with
complete naturalness, and with all the
spontaneous force that springs from com-
plete naturalness: with a force that
would have been a little blunted, what-
ever it might have gained in decorative
quality, if it had been constrained by
orthodox scansion.
The speech is, as the arrangement in
lines of verse shows, essentially poetry.
How much more of Shakspeare’s' “prose”
is really poetry? It is not only when he
has polysyllables to handle that—to save
argument with his period or with him-
self—he sets out his verse as prose, but
whenever there is a conflict between
correct iambic rhythm and the rhythms
of natural speech. It is when his charac-
ters are most themselves, when they speak
most forcibly in character, that their
words are set out as prose.
But when characters are most them-
selves, and are speaking with passion,
that is the very time when they are most
likely to talk poetry, Hamlet appears to
drop into prose again—and again most
oddly—in his savage and dramatic
“nunnery” scene with Ophelia. Here, too,
the dialogue falls naturally into lines of
five stresses ; it may be set out as poetry ;
and, essentially, is poetry:
Get thee to a nunnery; why wouldst thou be
a breeder
Of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;#
But yet I could accuse me of such things
That it were better my mother had not born
me:
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with
more offences
At my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
Imagination to give them shape, or time
To act them in. What should such fellows as
I do
Crawling between heaven and earth?
We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us.
Go thy ways to a nunnery.. .Where’s your
father?
If thou dost marry I’ll give thee this plague
for thy dowry—
Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow,
Thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to
a nunnery,
Go; farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry,
Marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
What monsters you make of them. To a
nunnery, go;
And quickly too. Farewell.
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough;
God has given you one face and you make
Yourselves another: you jig, you amble and
you lisp.
And nickname God’s creatures, and make your
wantonness your ignorance.
Go to, I’ll no more on’t; it hath made me mad.
I say, we will have no more marriages: those
That are married already, all but one, shall live;
The rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery,
go.
I do not suggest that Shakspeare meant
the lines to be set out in this way; if he
had consciously been writing “sprung
rhythm” he would probably have tidied
them a little, for even that kind of scan-
sion cannot safely wander too far away,
nor for too long, from the iambic metre
which is its formal basis. But I do sug-
gest that much of Shakspeare’s “prose”
is really poetry in the “sprung rhythm”
into which the spoken language naturally
falls when it is uttered with force and
conviction. Even Falstaff, whose lines
are always set out as prose, has a habit
of bursting into poetry when seriously
perturbed: —•
Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone?
No, ye fat chuffs; I would your store were
here —
and presumably that is one of the reasons
why Sir John, stalwart of prose comedy

S.
Japan and Asia.
A symposium of sketches by 13 Aus-
tralian journalists, all active reporters on
the late Pacific war fronts, edited and
arranged in Near North (Angus and
Robertson, Sydney), brings forward two
dominant questions: (1) Ought the White
Australia policy to be redrawn? (2)
What is to be Australian policy towards
the post-war Asia?
Near North covers in rapid and super-
ficial review the “island screen” off the
Australian coast, then the nearer lands of
the Asian mainland from India to Indo-
china, then the Philippines, China, Man-
churia and Japan. The “Cominform”
migrated south to Bangkok and Soura-
baya after these surveys had been written,
which may explain why the most interest-
ing chapter of all in a review striving to
be up-to-date remains unwritten. The
treatment is after the newsreel fashion
rather than that of the research student;
the aim is to represent the yeasty work-
ing of the nationalist sentiments aroused
by the cry of “Asia for the Asiatics,” and
the “perilous reality” of East Asia’s
modern nearness to empty white Aus-
tralia. “Nearly half the people in the
world live within a day’s north-westerly
flying of Darwin—in that part of Asia
within the triangle Darwin-Bombay-
Tokyo,” and “our fellow white men,
prodded by Japan’s pan-Asiatic propa-
ganda, by native swords and bayonets,
and by world opinion, have been puffing
out of their once vast domains in the
north.”
The war hastened the liberation of de-
pendent peoples in South-East Asia and
taught them to use aircraft and modern
weapons. It also made vocal their atti-
tude towards the White Australia policy,
for a restatement of which Mr. Clive
Turnbull pleads:—■
The expediency of protecting Australia
against any possible inrush of low-standard
labor has not been questioned; it is the
racial implications of the policy which
have come up for examination Good
relations with neighboring Asiatic countries
and self-respect would appear to demand
the replacement of the Immigration Re-
striction Act by legislation which, although
it will preserve the Australian economy from
inexpedient immigration, will rid us of the
taints of racialism and hypocrisy now
implicit in the Act —the lengths to which
this hypocrisy will go are demonstrated
in the Kisch case. Japan itself before the
second world war blocked the entry of
cheap labor from China as determinedly as
did Australia.
The dictation test should be abandoned.
Australia may surely declare its policy to
the world without sheltering behind sub-
terfuges. The scrapping of this obnoxious
provision and the substitution of a quota
system (even nominal) are all that is re-
quired.
Though the authors’ declared aim is
not “to sell ideas” but to inform, the in-
jection into the hard-shell Australian
body-politic of a virus working for an
active inquiry is purposeful enough. In
a foreword Dr. Evatt retorts curtly to
Mr. Turnbull that no restatement of the
White Australia policy is necessary ; and
where Mr. R. B. Leonard particularly,
and the editors generally, urge the need
for a clear and stable foreign policy. Dr.
Evatt has none at all to offer but faith
in U.N.O. and this quite futile prescrip-
tion : —-
Our role lies, firstly, in an earnest
endeavor to understand the problems and
needs of each of our neighbors; secondly,
in discussing the best ways of reciprocal
help [they, presumably, awaiting our con-
venience for attention]; and thirdly, the
carrying out of practical measures for
mutual assistance.
In pursuing such a policy we shall be
carrying out the pledges we have made
under the Atlantic Charter and the U.N.
Charter; we shall not prejudice but
strengthen both our close relationships with
the United States, and our still closer ties
of kinship with Great Britain, of whose
responsibilities in the Pacific and South-
East Asia Australia is shouldering a con-
siderable and increasing share.
If anybody notices anything of the sort
he should be asked to report it at once,
and the same applies to the ensuing sen-
tence :
Most important, we shall safeguard our
own national future in large measure, be-
cause the existence of stable, progressive,
prosperous, and democratically - inclined
Governments in the Pacific and Asia is.
fundamental to Australia’s own security.
Well may Mr. Leonard, in his chapter
on Australian foreign policy, conclude
that it all seems to be “somewhat
muddled” despite the table-pounding tech-
nique at U.N.O. of Dr. Evatt, and that
“the means of implementing a security
policy for the Pacific have yet to be de-
cided.” As the now twice-repudiated
Mr. Macmahon Ball, one of Dr. Evatt’s
diplomatic staff, has put it;
A successful Australian foreign policy
implies three things: First, we must have
something to say; second, we must find
the opportunities to say it in the right
place and at the right times; and third,
we must discover the best manner and
method of getting our voice not simply
heard, but heeded No doubt the casual
and perfunctory treatment that Parliament
usually gives to international questions
faithfully reflects a widespread lack of active
interest among the Australian people. What
is the use of complaining that the Great
Powers ignore the Australian view, if there
is nothing here that can be called an
Australian view?
And, he might have added, what is the
use of asserting a foreign policy in a
world still untamed to peace when we
have no military force to back it up?
Mr. Ball pursues this topic in his
Japan: Enemy or Ally ? (Cassell, Mel-
bourne), the fruit of his 18 months of
service in Japan as representative of
British Empire countries on the Allied
Council. He resigned on Dr. Evatt’s visit
to Japan in August, 1947, because, as he
said, “I feel I cannot carry on under Dr.
Evatt.” It becomes clear that, for all his
brushes with General MacArthur’s repre-
sentatives, he took a far broader view of
the problem than he recognised in his
Minister. He describes in great detail the
policy of S.C.A.P. as carried out, its
gradual change of purpose, the disruption
caused by the American conviction —for
which “I believe there were good
grounds”—that Russia’s primary interest
was to discredit S.C.A.P. and sabotage
American objectives. As Mr. Ball
discusses these objectives and the de-
velopment of them, the grounds of his
quarrel with Dr. Evatt seem to be re-
vealed '.gr-
in. the summer of 1947 I was talking
privately with an American general [who
questioned him about an Australian atti-
tude unintelligible to him]. I was trying
to explain, when my friend cut in sharply,
“When for Pete’s sake will you seven mil-
lion Australians realise the importance of
having seventy million, allies in this
country?” He felt that Australia was
thinking and acting as though it were still
1945, not 1947 I believe we must face
the question the general put if we are to
be realistic about security in the Pacific
In 1945 the Soviet Union was still an
ally. Today the whole world is divided
by the clash of interests and policies be-
tween America and Russia The United
States has never had greater need of a
good neighbor in the Far East. In 1945
it was hoped that China would form this
“point of stability,” but China has been
a tragic disappointment And so China
has been replaced by Japan as the Power
which, with American support, is assigned
the task of stabilising the Far East.
China may “come again.” Mr. Rhodes
Farmer, an intimate of the Chiangs in
Chungking, writes in Near North his be-
lief that “within a decade China may be
a new and powerful force in the Pacific
and in the world,” and “will want a
wealthy, productive, inventive Japan” as
“a pillar of Pan-Asianism.”
Mr. Ball agrees that Japan should not
and cannot be kept economically weak,
and holds that though the risks taken in
the effort to “democratise” her are enor-
mous the gamble must be accepted. In
any case the United States is calling the
tune, and the American effort to re-estab-
lish China as a counterweight is not
finished either.
There is no secret about the reasons for
America’s changed outlook. There is the
simple and understandable wish to make
Japan self-supporting and not a permanent
burden on the American taxpayer. This
change runs parallel to the change in Ger-
many. But the root motive is political
It is fear of Russia and Communism.
America desires a strong and prosperous
Japan as a backing against the extension
of Russian influence in the Far East and
the growth thereunder of Japanese Com-
munism.
Mr. Ball accepts this argument, though
he dislikes —possibly on behalf of a
Socialist Australian Government—the
idea of a Japanese democracy made
strong through private capitalism under
a regime of free competitive enterprise
(American model). Whether that is be-
cause Japan may rapidly become a great
Power again, or because it will help to
stimulate Communism in Japan, is not
quite clear ; Mr. Ball bases passing objec-
tions on both heads.
The concluding demand—that, what-
ever other developments are allowed,
there shall be “firm safeguards against
the renewal of Japan’s military power"
—will be generally endorsed. Dr. Evatt
will rightly want to have guarantees of
that written into the peace settlement.
But his Government is poles away from
appreciating the only way in which such
safeguards can be made worth anything
“We must,” writes Mr. Ball, “have the
will and resources to ensure that any
undertakings extracted from Japan will
be carried out.” If that is to be left to
the United States, then the United States
will have the last word on what those
undertakings shall be. “Diplomacy with-
out arms,” said Frederick the Great, “is
like music without instruments.” Thai
is a truth to which the Chifley Govern-
ment seems hitherto to have closed its
collective mind.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
Aims in Berlin.
A remarkable exposition of
the Russian aims and possible
moves in Berlin has been given
in a long N. Y. “Times” letter
by Stefan Osusky, former
Czechoslovakian Minister to
France and Minister of State in
the Czech Government-in-Exile.
Osusky, now a Professor of
European History in America,
states that what Russia is about
in Germany is “a vast political
operation which, while present-
ing great risks, promises a rich
harvest” ; no less than the wreck-
ing of the European Recovery
Programme and all it means, and
with that the falling of Europe
under Soviet sway.
That issue, far above any mere
point of prestige, is what is in
the balance in Berlin.
The Russians, says Osusky,
hold a “most alluring bait, de-
signed to make the Germans side
with them against the West,” but
before throwing the bait the
Kremlin “must be sure that the
Communist parties of the
satellite countries will obey un-
conditionally its orders. The fact
that the satellite countries, since
their liberation, have been gov-
erned by Popular Fronts led the
Communist leaders to col-
laborate with non-Communists
and become accustomed to prac-
tising compromise. Now, accus-
tomed to serve the national in-
terests of their country, tjiese
leaders are not the most reliable
agents for the execution of the
Kremlin operation with the Ger-
mans. That is why the
Rumanian Communist war
leader Patroscano has been
eliminated and Gheorghiu, the
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-
President of the Rumanian Com-
munist party, disgraced. That is
why Klement Gottwald has been
kicked upstairs to the Presidency
of the Czech Republic, a purely
decorative function.”
A similar explanation applies
to Tito’s fall from grace. Tito
“enlisted the support of an im-
portant portion of Yugosla.v
youth by appealing to their
patriotism. Such a man, with
such backing, could not be relied
upon blindly to support the
Kremlin policy for Germany.
Therefore uncorrupted Com-
munist believers must be in-
stalled in power in Belgrade.”
The satellites secure, next the
attractive bait: “Once holding
firmly the Communist parties of
the satellite countries in its hands,
and through them their Govern-
ments, the Kremlin can afford
to offer to the Western Powers
the military evacuation of
Europe. Under such conditions
Soviet Russia could militarily
evacuate the Russian zone and
Austria without running a
serious risk, while the Western
Powers, at the present stage,
would lose everything. In any
case Soviet Russia expects to
derive political capital from her
gesture.”
In the cunning game Osusky
describes the Russians as play-
ing, the hopeful Kremlin view is
that it stands to gain either way:
“Should the Western Powers re-
fuse to enter upon the offered
deal, the Soviets are already en-
gaged in affirming their prestige
and their indispensability for the
Germans. They show that they
control the sewage, the water,
electricity and food supplies of
the west of Berlin. They are pre-
pared to satisfy the mystic faith
of the Germans in their own
unity by setting up an all-
German Government in Berlin,
having at its disposal the Von
Paulus army from Stalingrad,
swollen by volunteers from
prisoners-of-war in Yugoslavia
to over 200,000 men. From that
moment on, the Western Allies
would face in Berlin, not the
Soviets but their agents.”
These ambitions, in the view
of this leading Czech, wholly
explain reported trouble that
Moscow has been having with
its satellites. It is a typically
ruthless policy, which would
“betray both the Slav trust which
romantic Poles, Czechs, Slovaks,
Yugoslavs and Bulgarians placed
in Moscow, and the faith that
it will secure them against a new
German aggression,” and hence
“it is but natural that the
Kremlin desires to have in
power, in all the satellite coun-
tries, fanatical believers in the
providential leadership of the
Political Bureau.”
And, it could be added, not
only have such believers in
power but have the Communist
fifth-column elsewhere in a posi-
tion to disrupt industries, trans-
port and the like in any 'ountries
weakly governed.
Not “Trigger-happy.”
A good many reports on
Berlin appearing in cables leave
the impression that U.S. occupa-
tion leader General Clay is fairly
itching to have a crack at the
Russians.
The reports cater to the
popular notion that soldiers are
always eager for war, the truth
being the very opposite, in Clay's
case as in many others.
Regarding Clay, N. Y. “Daily
Mirror” reports that he has
strongly held out against actions
suggested by non-soldiers in his
Administration, Clay declaring
that if an incident took place
passions that would arise could
not then be controlled. He de-
scribed proposed actions as “un-
wise and dangerous” and likely
to “commit us to war.”
“In brief,” adds the report,
“here is one historic case where
a soldier is reluctant to use force
though civilians urge it.”
Clay himself is reported to
have summed up on what is a
widespread fallacy when con-
gratulated by an old acquaint-
ance on not being “trigger-
happy.” Said Clay, “Maybe
that’s why they keep a soldier in
Berlin.”
Prosecution Pending?
A Scripps-Howard report de-
clares that “the United States
and other Powers are now pre-
pared to prosecute Russia before
the United Nations” in thS
reasonably near future.
A few weeks back U.N.O.
Secretary-General Lie proposed
laying the Berlin case before the
Security Council, he having the
right to do this with “any matter
which in his opinion may
threaten the peace.” The
Scripps-Howard report stated
that Washington, London and
Paris, in unison, said “the time
was not quite ripe.”
The aim, naturally, would be
to have Russia in a position of
having to defend actions that
could be proved to be menacing
peace, and apparently the other
Powers were not quite ready for
that. The suggestion is that they
would be after further abortive
negotiations.
“This mhch is now certain,”
the Scripps '- Howard report
added; “if the case against
Russia as a warmongering,
aggressor nation is ever laid be-
fore the United Nations, she will
be called on to answer the most
devastating array of counts ever
brought against any member
nation. Allied foreign offices
are ready with literally dozens
of factual specific treaty viola-
tions, with names, dates and
places.”
Even as it is, there should not
be much trouble in proving be-
fore U.N.O. that Soviet Russia
alone, for three years, has
blocked world peace; that in-
side and outside U.N.O. she has
exercised her veto to prevent
settlement of German, Japanese
and other problems, and that
consequently these problems
have steadily deteriorated, bring-
ing the world to the brink of
war, •
The actual record would
show conclusively that Russia
has violated practically every
treaty she has entered into with
other countries. The U.S. State
Department already has pub-
lished an astounding list of such
violations, complete with names,
dates, places and other details.
“Falsifiers of History.”
A question that must often
puzzle those dealing with Soviet
Russia —or, in fact, anyone try-
ing to understand Soviet propa-
ganda—is whether the Kremlin
acts on the Hitler prescription of
the bigger the lie the better or
whether the Russian mind is
just plain childlike and funny.
A specimen of the propaganda
put out by the Soviet Embassy
in Washington (of all places)
and attacking “falsifiers of his-
tory” declares that the U.S. and
Britain together had only sup-
plied Russia during the war with
“some 10,000 tanks and nearly
as many guns and aircraft” —
say, 30,000 items in all.
Looking into the books in
Washington, a “Christian Science
Monitor” reporter dug out the
actual figures for U.S. supplies
of planes, guns and the like to
war-time Russia (leaving out the
fabulous amounts of other things
supplied, and also leaving out al-
together what Britain supplied):
14,795 planes
7,056 tanks
51,503 jeeps
375,883 trucks
8,218 anti-aircraft guns
131,633 sub-machine guns
In view of this, the report
added, Washington officials agree
heartily with the concluding note
in the Soviet statement: “Such
are the historic facts, which no
falsifier of history or slanderer
can distort, since facts are stub-
born things—gossip and slander
fade away but facts remain.”
J. Bull in Africa.
An American onlooker, writ-
ing in N. Y. “World-Telegram,”
surveys J.B.’s holdings on the
Dark Continent:
“If you count British-
Egyptian Sudan and exclude
South Africa, the British flag
flies over African territory larger
than the United States. There
are approximately 3,300,000
square miles of it, with about
60,000,000 population. Some
areas have been called ‘the
white-man’s grave,’ but much of
it is suited for European settle-
ment.”
And not only vast but very
valuable property: “Kenya
could produce enough cotton to
make British textile mills inde-
pendent of the rest of the world.
“Southern Rhodesia, three
times the size of England, grows
cotton, corn, tobacco and other
crops, and is rich in gold, coal,
chrome, asbestos and other
minerals.”
The view of Empire-supporters
in Britain, quoted by the writer,
is that turning these holdings to
the best account is not a question
of exploiting backward popu-
lations, old-style, but of improv-
ing their lot in their own in-
terests as well as Britain’s—a
great work that could be done
“if only the Government would
encourage risk capital to go to
work again, and if free enter-
prise were not taxed and con-
trolled out of existence.”
Nationalism.
In a thoughtful analysis in his
N. Y. “Sun” column, George E.
Sokolsky looks into thp Krenllin-
Tito clash and sees it as largely
the outcome of a revival of
nationalism in the Balkans —a
nationalism surviving and re-
surgent elsewhere as well, despite
trends to decry it and attempts
to make U.N.O. an expression
and active agent of its opposite,
internationalism.
Nationalism, the writer con-
tends, survives because it is “a
normal desire of human beings
to protect their soil, their
language, their traditions, their
religion, their folkways from
assimilation, absorption and dis-
appearance. The revival of
Israel after 20 centuries of
struggle and dreams is a
nationalistic movement. Simi-
larly, the recrudescence of Arab
life is nationalistic. In the
Balkans, nationalism is parti-
cularly potent.”
Also in the Ukraine, where
nationalism has always been
much the same problem for the
Soviet controllers as it is now
showing itself to be in the
Balkans. The Tito problem, as
the writer sees it, is that whereas
Soviet Russia is willing to
recognise the right of any people
within the Soviet federation to
its own language, folkways and,
to some extent, even religious
practices, it does not and cannot
recognise the right of a minor
people to develop into a primary
State. It also seeks to maintain
a status quo, a freezing of geo-
graphical and physical lines.
Russia is not, for instance, pre-
pared to permit Yugoslavia or a
Balkan Federation to challenge
the primacy of Russia or even
to achieve an equality with it. It
is unwilling to move the centre
of power from Moscow to Bel-
grade—or anywhere else.
Thus Soviet Russia rejects
nationalism —for others. “For
instance, the Russians can
elevate Ivan the Terrible to
national sainthood, but not John
Sobieski, the Pole. But Sobieski,
Kosciusko and Pulaski and
Paderewski live in Polish
nationalism as Peter the Great
lives in Russian nationalism.
Heroes never die. In Russia, the
Communists may worship Lenin,
but the Poles may not even re-
spect Pilsudski, nor may a Yugo-
slav regard Tito as a national
hero. It is a paradoxical method
and falls by its own contradic-
tions.”
In Sokolsky’s view nationalism
will naturally gain strength in
every country in Europe and
Asia that is not independent and
sovereign, for human beings do
not long accept tyranny, but
fight, overtly or by any means,
for freedom.
Truman Woos the Left.
In the view of various
American commentators, the
major mistake of President
Truman —the mistake they con-
sider certain to defeat him —
is his continuation of Leftist
policies in an at-present de-
cidedly “non-radical” U.S.
As an example of the wooing
of the Left, the Democratic con-
vention which affirmed Truman
for Dewey to oppose for the
Presidency plumped for outright
repeal of the Taft-Hartley Labor
Management Act —“a plain and
unmasked bid for the ‘labor
vote’,” as N. Y. “Times” de-
scribed it.
That Left-bid plank of policy
indicates clearly one section of
the divison in the much-divided
Democratic ranks. Truman at
the time vetoed the labor-control
bill, but 106 Democratic
members in Congress voted to
override the President’s veto,
whereas only 76 Democratic
members supported the veto.
N. Y. “World - Telegram”
economic writer Lawrence
Fertig points out that no one
could have followed more
closely the Leftist line than
Truman has done all through.
His faithfulness to it “has been
unquestionable and unswerving.”
And yet the Left is in the general
scurry to get from under the
coming predicted fall. “The
President himself,” says Fertig,
“is angry at the attacks by his
old friends [that is, of the Left,
whom he has given ‘TOO per
cent, support”]. It seems like a
doublecross to him.”
The explanation—merely the
ordinary game of politics: “The
most obvious reasons why the
Left-wing groups have run out
on the President is that they
feel he can’t win. What they do
not take into account is that his
unpopularity is due, in great
measure, to the policies which
they advocated and which the
President adopted. Having
gotten Mr. Truman in hot water,
they now desert him. Mr. Tru-
man is hardly to be blamed for
being incensed with this kind of
disloyalty by people who claim
they are ‘liberals’ and therefore
claim to have a superior code of
ethics.”
It is just the irony of the game
that the most bitter opposition
to the Left-serving President
should come not from the Re-
publican side (sponsors of the
disputed Left-curling legislation),
but from Wallace, representing
nothing but the extreme Left.
Dragnet Digest.
First 50 Years the Worst— New
York “World-Telegram” Washington
column quotes “top-ranking military
planners” as saying that if war comes
“it may last a lifetime.” Every other
war ever fought was hailed by the
prophets as certain to be short, so
maybe they could be wrong again.
* * * *
Surfeit of Memoirs. —The endless
memoirs by Cordell Hull, Stimson,
Morgenthau and others giving inside
(often conflicting) accounts of Roose-
velt’s reign are stirring a natural
reaction. According to Scripps-
Howard Washington report, Dewey is
being urged to get flat commitments
from Cabinet members that they
won’t resort to the inkstand for at
least 20 years.
* * * *
Showdown Meeting. —lt might be
thought there have been more than
enough meetings with Russia to con-
vince anybody that they are a waste
of time; still, the further meeting
had strong advocates, in the U.S.A.
as well as in evidently more cautious
France and Britain. As typical of
U.S. comment, Walter Lippmann, in
N. Y. “Herald Tribune,” held that
“if a settlement can be reached, the
peak of the world crisis will have
been surmounted; and if it cannot
be reached because the Russians are
playing a devious game, negotiations
will expose the plot and strengthen
greatly our own position for what-
ever is to come.” The snag is the
belief, based on bitter experience, that
anything the Kremlin agreed to would
not be honored.
* * * ♦
Against U.S. Aid. —Opposition in
Britain to accepting American aid is
put down by Scripps-Howard foreign
editor William Philip Simms mainly
to two beliefs: (1) An increasing
number of British businessmen, in-
dustrialists and economists are con-
vinced that no amount of American
aid can save Britain. These feel that
she must save herself by her own
efforts. (2) If it weren’t for American
aid the Labor Government almost
certainly would fall within the next
three or four months and the Con-
servatives probably would come in
under Winston Churchill.
* * * *
Russia in Asia. —Lenin had great
hopes of having Asia in the Com-
munist fold, and in China, Malaya
and elsewhere Kremlin policy is try-
ing, with its active fifth-columns (and
the indirect assistance of passive on-
lookers), to make the hopes an early
reality. In tactics, as aN. Y. “World-
Telegram” writer points out, Russia
is following the lead of Japan and
preaching “Asia for the Asiatics.”
Japan’s idea was that once Asia had
thrown out the Europeans Japan
would dominate all. Russia—Stalin
prides himself on being an Asiatic —
has precisely the same objective.
* * * *
U.S. Guarantee in Europe. No
matter what might appear to be
secured in negotiations with Russia
over Berlin, a correspondent of
N. Y. “Herald Tribune” insists that
there will still have to be posi-
tive measures to make the West
secure against both a resurgent Ger-
many and a predatory Russia—
nothing short of “an American mili-
tary guarantee, implemented with
American rearmament, with military
lend-lease and even with skeleton
American forces based on Western
Europe.” And this guarantee, com-
mitting America to the hilt, should
be “signed, sealed and ratified by
Congress before a German peace
treaty is agreed to.”

Welly Cheap Suit! Brief story
from China which says enough about
the inflation there; A man contracted
to buy a suit for 80,000,000 Chinese
dollars and paid the tailor 30,000,000
dollars as a deposit. He changed the
other 50,000,000 into $3O American.
Two weeks later the tailor delivered
the suit. The customer changed his
30 American dollars back into Chinese

Thorez Feels the Whip. —Not only
Tito but the French Communist
leader Thorez lately felt the Kremlin
lash, but with a different result. “The
charges levelled against Thorez,” says
a report in N. Y. “Herald Tribune,
“were precisely the same as those
hurled at Tito.” The report states
that the tongue-banging occurred at
“a secret meeting of the top leader-
ship of the French Communist party
and was administered by an emissary
sent specially from Moscow. But,
whereas Tito showed some fight,
“Thorez obediently performed the re-
quired Communist rite of confession
of sins and promised his colleague
and the Kremlin to follow the path
of true righteousness in the future.
Unlike Tito, with his 36 divisions.
Thorez had no real choice.”

"CRISIS " POSTPONED.
To suppose that the last-minute inter-
vention of Mr. Chifley’s “fixer,” Senator
Ashley, and N.S.W. Premier McGirr so
cleared the air on N. S. Wales coalfields
last week that “the crisis will be over-
come and production will be improved
from now on” (McGirr press statement)
is to overtax public credulity. It would
convey that Communist miners’-boss
Williams was laid aside with not
only the reported poisoned leg but also
a broken heart; and that the gang which
has set out to hold the public to ransom
and to defy a tribunal which has “all (he
powers of the Arbitration Court” has
been overawed suddenly by the awful
majesty of those “Labor” Ministers whom
the miners’ leaders have for years been
twisting around their little fingers.
The only explanation of the deferred
showdown is that the Joint Coal
Board has once again, as in April
last, been instructed by the “Govern-
ments” in Canberra and Sydney to yield
what is necessary to avert an immediate
strike, no matter what the issue. That the
same “Governments” interfere in this
fashion as a matter of policy is clear from
the statement of the Minister, Mr.
Dedman, who piloted through Parliament
in f 946 the bill establishing the board:
Because of the far-reaching nature of its
decisions, it is important that the board
should conform to directions on particular
matters of policy. The principle of Par-
liamentary and Ministerial responsibility
for policy has been preserved by the ulti-
mate right of the Prime Minister in agree-
ment with the Premier of New South Wales
to give policy directions to the board.
Political management of the mines, over
the heads of the mineowners, is thus
assured, with all its attendant evils.
Even more serious is the demonstration
that the one-man CoaL Tribunal, Mr.
Gallagher, equipped “witn all the powers
of the Arbitration Court,” is thereby
frustrated by this Government string-
pulling. He is moved by the Joint
Coal Board to declare that discipline
shall be asserted, knd he makes an order.
Then the political “fixers” intervene, the
Coal Board leaves him in the lurch, and
he is presented with a political settlement
for registration as by agreement between
the parties,
Mr. Gallagher was thus defeated in
April, when the Coal Board first initiated
last week’s moves to enforce discipline
and then ran away from them on “assur-
ances” of amends from the Miners’
Federation. He was similarly defeated
in June over the award he had
made for filling rates for machine-cut
coal—against which the miners’ executive
threatened a strike as they did last week.
When “Government” interference thus
calls the board to heel, it obliges the Coal
Tribunal also to comply as effectually as
though it had interfered with Mr.
Gallagher directly. This is not only
slaying arbitration on the coalfields; it
is also ringing the death-knell of the
Federal Arbitration Court, “with all the
powers” of which Mr. Gallagher is in-
vested.
Mr. McGirr says “the crisis has been
overcome,” and “production will improve
from now on.” On the contrary, the
“crisis” has been merely adjourned.
Actually, as well as legally, it still over-
shadows and appals Australian industry,
.the suspense of which is unrelieved in any
way, and whose reliance upon an ordered
and respected legal authority is being de-
stroyed. The Coal Board’s own figures—
stated in evidence last week before the
Ashley-McGirr surrender —show that in
1947 there was mined 400,000 tons less coal
than in 1939, and that only an increase
on that pre-war year of 900,000 tons from
opencut workings marked any improve-
ment in the aggregate. This was the
record despite the fact that there were
1300 more hands employed in coalgetting.
Moreover, in the interval since 1939 con-
sumers’ requirements have risen by “from
50 per cent, to 70 per cent.,” says the
Coal Board’s secretary. These figures
spell approaching disaster for the Com-
monwealth. Last week “Labor” Ministers
advertised to the world the disgraceful
extremity into which they have driven
the nation —that Australia might have to
import coal from wherever it can be
bought abroad.
Last April their Joint Coal Board de-
clared, in a statement reflecting its own
exasperation with the brigandage on the
coalfields—the Coal Tribunal himself
described it as “intolerable”—that the
nation’s minimum requirements this year
were 13 million tons (it will be lucky if
it gets three-quajters of that), that that
volume was capable of being produced,
and that unless the Miners’ Federation
asserted discipline over its members “the
supply position would force someone else
to do so.” Lately its secretary told
the Tribunal that “events had shown that
the Federation could not control its
members,” and formally applied for
orders from the Tribunal requiring;
Miners to remain at work for five work-
ing days before and after each statutory
holiday in order to qualify to be paid
for that idle day.
Payment for three weeks’ annual leave
to be based on one day’s pay for each 15
consecutive shifts worked during the year.
Immediate implementation of agreement
to prevent petty stoppages (over horses’
bad breath or somebody’s mislaid boots).
Increased output in mines where
mechanical borers have been introduced.
Two shifts to be worked in opencut
workings where possible.
Alternate (or back-) Saturdays to be
worked (double rates paid, of course) for
the latter part of this year in order to
provide enough coal over miners’ annual
holidays. (This is now becoming an annual
necessity.) ,
To the very presentation of these de-
mands the miners’ executive objected.
When the board insisted on its applica-
tion and the Tribunal granted it and pre-
pared to enforce an .order, the Chifley-
McGirr combination intervened. Yet last
June in Parliament Mr. Chifley said;
Time will prove that the legislation pro-
viding for a Joint Coal Boafd was the best
legislation that has been passed for the
control of the industry.
The control of the industry! It would
make a Com. laugh.
The community’s hand-to-mouth living
on fuel shortages is likely to remain with
industry and householders alike for some
time ahead. Leaving out longer-range
problems, the outlook for the next four
years reveals the Coal Board’s task as
desperate. The target set for 1952,
according to Mr. Jack, who is the coal
expert among the board’s three members,
is 18 million tons from underground
mines—half much again as the war
years’ annual target, which was only once
reached. Mr. Jack has published as a
pamphlet his address last April to the
Australasian Institute of Mining and
Metallurgy. “For the next two or three
years,” he says, “the board is relying for
increased production chiefly on opencut
mines.” Underground meanwhile all
efforts have to be made to “mechanise
coalgetting and handling operations as
rapidly as possible.” Much new capital
is necessary to equip the mines on modern
lines, and when the miners won’t use,
or (in some cases) retard the working of,
machines already provided, the owners
have not much inducement to launch out
on this expenditure. “In many cases,”
says Mr. Jack, “capital will be provided
by the Coal Board on a proper business
basis.” For sake of the future the work
must be undertaken. The starvation
shortage of coal today emphasises that
truth. .
Mr. Jack’s review establishes that im-
proved miners’ amenities and the
guarantee to them of employment,
and increasing employment, depend upon
expansion of production with the means
available. That is to say, it depends
upon the prosperity of the nation as a
whole. This is the basis of the Coal
Board’s recent attempts, now twice
thwarted, to enforce continuity of work-
ing under forms of authority and con-
ditions of working which have met the
miners’ own demands.
The Federal and N.S.W. Governments
are now apparently parties with the Coal
Board to offering the miners’ executive
another chance to discipline its own
members. Under the “settlement” terms
the board’s application for enforcement
of the law by the Tribunal is adjourned.
Meanwhile, whether under express orders
from the Tribunal or not, the miners will
have to qualify for paid annual holidays
by continuity of production. On that
test the whole “settlement” must stand
or fall.
Dr. Evatt's Gift to U.N.O.
In New Guinea, as in every other area
which it has touched, the Canberra Gov-
ernment is beginning to reap trouble and
embarrassment. New Guinea will have
good cause to remember Mr. Ward and
Dr. Evatt, those two enthusiasts whose
operations are apt at times to make the
onlooker believe that their cases might
form material for consideration by a
psychiatric commission.
Mr. Ward, from the moment he took
over the New Guinea and Papuan
Administration, has seemed to be bent
more on discomfiting members of his
own white race who happen to be sub-
ject to him than in establishing sane
government.
Advised by a committee of theorists,
and aided by his apparent bitterness
towards his fellow-Australians, Mr.
Ward has created more ruin in the
area which he is supposed to govern
than 20 tornadoes. He has a civil
service which, while it has a mini-
mum living wage that would have made
pre-war employees of the Government
feel like millionaires, is kept on the star-
vation line because, under the Ward
brand of democracy, costs have gone up
to the stars. A few weeks ago the con-
certed ranks of these loyal and highly-
paid servants of the Commonwealth
boycotted the Administrator at a cricket
match held in Moresby, a fact which was
reported in the press without in any way
ruffling the calm of the Minister, who,
as it happened, at that moment had other
things to think about.
There is now none of the private tourist
trade which used to bring lucrative busi-
ness to a do?en stations in New Guinea
and Papua because taxation and the
Government’s policy of repression, allied
with the obstructive tactics of the Com-
munist-directed Australian seamen’s and
waterside unions, have killed it utterly.
Guinea Airways, which did more for
the development of the gold industry
than any other agency, has ceased to
operate, and is not likely to return to
New Guinea until another Government
is in power. Having built up a fine
Northern Territory service during the
war, and having been of the greatest use
'in the defence of the country, its Aus-
tralian mainland service was grabbed the
other day by a Civil Aviation Depart-
ment, the commissar of which is Mr.
Chifley’s close personal friend and
adviser, Mr. W. C. Taylor.
The gold industry is hampered and
harassed by labor difficulties, high wages
and regulations, not to mention the in-
conveniences due to shipping shortages
and the incidences of a red-tape inter-
ference with everything which produces
wealth. The industry’s disabilities could
scarcely he worsened behind the Iron
Curtain in Rumania or Yugoslavia.
Copra is, of course, the normal main-
stay of the island trade. But under the
Ward regime its production has been
managed entirely for the purpose of pro-
viding a tribute for Mr. Ward’s depart-
ment. The business has been controlled
by a board. Merchants and traders have
not been free to buy copra except through
the Government. And prices have been
fixed at an artificial level so that Mr.
Ward could collect £6 a ton on the out-
put, which he has poured into a fund
for purposes vague and to an extent
which nobody knows.
The state of the copra market
as it relates to New Guinea was
shown by July quotations. Copra
landed in Sydney last month —the Aus-
tralian requirement is about 20,000 tons
a year —was priced officially at £6l a
ton, hot-air dried, and £6O smoked.
This represents a rise of £25 a ton since
January, 1947. And still the copra in-
dustry is in a precarious position through
lack of labor, high cost of operations and
other baffling difficulties, all of which are
due to a socialistic policy.
Confusion has been made worse by a
recent announcement, as delusive as most
of the Government’s announcements, that
the Production Control Board will be
wound up. Any shout of joy from the
planters was stilled by the thought that
the industry would remain under Govern-
ment control through shipping restrictions
and the general Canberra policy of
socialistic interference.
Dr. Evatt’s share in the ruin of Aus-
tralia’s dependent territories is equal to
that of Mr. Wkrd’s. Not only did he
accede readily to the proposition that
New Guinea should be handed over to
the tender mercies of U.N.0., with the
Australian Commonwealth as its agent,
but he rushed to bring that state of affairs
about. More than that, he eagerly
fostered the proposition that Papua and
New Guinea should become a single
administrative unit. This arrangement
is tenable and workable on only one of
two bases —that both areas become sub-
ject either to U.N.O. policies and super-
vision, or both to Australian policies.
It is scarcely possible for an Adminis-
tration with a single legislature and civil
service and headquarters to operate two
separate policies within a joint territory.
It is quite impossible to have two kinds of
citizenship in one country without throw-
ing overboard everything which makes
for good government.
Dr. Evatt, however, is not only ready
but eager to turn the Papuan into a
U.N.O. citizen. It is now only a fiction
that Papua is a part of the Com-
monwealth proper, for the Common-
wealth to do what it likes with. The
stern truth is that Dr. Evatt has given
away Papua, as must be clear to anybody
who considers the matter for a moment.
And to make sure that his gift is fully
effective, the doctor has invited a number
of Pacific “nations,” among which the
Filipinos and the Indonesians must
logically be included, to form a Pacific
Commission, which is at present busily
seeking a general secretary and other
highly-paid and tax-exempt officials.
These will advise on native and other
policy and generally interfere with our
affairs in the New Guinea area.
To cap what has been done in the
ceding of authority over Papua, the Gov-
ernment now has a bill ready to pass its
second reading in Parliament under which
the two areas will form a legislative union,
with a legislative council consisting of
16 officers of the joint territories, three
representatives of the missions, three
representatives of the non-indigenous
population—one of whom at least will be
Chinese —and three representatives of the
native population, plus three members
to be elected. There is nothing in the
measure to say how any of the members
shall be appointed or elected. There is
nothing to indicate whether the' three
representatives of all classes will be
elected by whites only, which would mean
election by the civil service, or by
natives and others —which would mean
election by natives and Chinese.
Whatever the position, the Administra-
tion must be dominated by New Guinea
Mandated Area interests, and Papua
must inevitably become, under this sys-
tem, a plaything of U.N.O. —which has
accepted Ward-Evatt principles, is sub-
servient to its policies and is governed, de
facto, by the galaxy of gentlemen of the
Trustee Council who have within the past
week or two made the Australian repre-
sentatives at Lake Success toe tHf* line
and answer questions.
If its action in dealing with Papua
does not defeat the Chifiey Government
nothing can. It acted without authority
from the people and without regard to
the interests of this country’s defence,
which demand that all the islands of
the New Guinea-Solomons-Hebrides-New
Zealand chain should be integrated in
a defence scheme with which no foreigner
should have the power to interfere on
any pretext whatever.
Longer Spoon Wanted.
With an air quaintly disconsolate, but to
the relief of his friends and admirers,
the Rector of St. James’s, Sydney, has
resigned from the so-called Australian-
Russian Society. The fact that he had
been chairman of it had added to the
concern of many people.
If Mr. Davidson was influenced in his
decision by reading Dallin and Niko-
laevsky’s Forced Labor in Soviet Russia
—the story of 15 to 20 millions immured
today in the Communists’ slave-camps—
then he would do further good by saying
so. If he has not read these disclosures,
then he should hurry to arm himself
with this further warrant —guaranteed to
wipe away all tears at parting from the
A.-R. Society—for his “unwillingness to
be associated in the remotest way with
Communism.”
Mr. Davidson says: “The crucial test
of our time is British-U.S.A.-Russian
relationships.” That is an abstract truth.
He adds: “I will not cease to do what
little I can, however ineffective, to better
these.” Ineffective Mr. Davidson’s efforts
seem doomed to be, for even as chair-
man of the society from which he “ex-
pedited” his resignation he found him-
self, he says, playing “rather a lonely
role as critic.” How, then, breathing
freely again outside it, can he serve better
the cherished ends? Mr. Davidson ought
by now to appreciate that it was his in-
fluence in the pulpit, his “pull” as a name
in its propaganda, that this coterie was
after.
That any churchman of the Western
world should cherish hopes for “better
relationships” with those sadistic despots
of Moscow who have out-Hitlered Hitler
must bring wry smiles to intelligent
Christians. What could be the gain?
The establishment of peace in the world
—simple, stable peace—as Mr, David-
son (for instance) understands it? Then
he should know that to Communists in
their spiritual home that language and
the very idea are quite foreign.
Or is the cherished aim to teach re-
morse to these architects of tragedy over
half a continent (their own half)?
In that case the field of operations is not
here, but over there. The futility of
“peace” propaganda among our own
people on behalf of, say, the League of
Nations, and now its post-Hitler successor,
is that all the effort went, and still goes,
into preaching to the converted.
The scales having fallen Mr.
Davidson’s eyes, he can hardly fail to
ask himself why a host of earnest men
in Britain and America (churchmen,
statesmen, soldiers, relief-workers) who
have for three years spent their best
energies in trying to bring this Moscow
gang to sweet reasonableness have
failed —have been rebuffed, calumniated;
tricked, mocked, thwarted every time.
The posturing and pretences, the whok
worthless stunting of this so-called
tralian-Russian Society, are no recreation
for a Rector of St. James’s. Let hirn
leave such antics to the Clive Evatts of
this limelighting generation. “He who sups
with the devil should use a long spoon;


PLAIN ENGLISH
Ruffianism and Stupidity.
Looking back over the years, The
Bulletin has no regrets for having dis-
sociated itself from the writing boys and
radio oracles who urged Britlain —still
nursing its 1914-18 war wounds and
hard-hit by the depression—to become
“the knight-errant of the human race.”
To go to war for Haile Silassie (“the little
Black Pearl”) in Abyssinia, for the Reds
in Spain and in China (already in league
with the Red Chinese in Malaya, now
burning and butchering in the effort to
establish a “Soviet State”) and for “demo-
cratic” Czechoslovakia, and drag the Em-
pire in with it. Not only the Dominions,
which had their own problems to solve,
but India, Burma, Egypt, Palestine, Cey-
lon, Malaya (Red Chinese and all) and the
rest of the colonies, all represented as
steadfast in the cause.
In those days the term “Fascist” was
applied to everyone who did not accept
the Communist “philosophy” and agree
that all Red revolutionaries were won-
derful and their women all beautiful.
Even Thornton, Healy and Elliott were
hailed as splendid fellows who showed
real magnanimity when they said they
might condescend to name Essington
Lewis Commissar of the Communised
iron and steel industries.
In the course of events, with India,
Burma, Egypt and Palestine out of the
Empire and Britain itself in a serious
plight, the tails of the sentimental Leftist
writing boys and radio oracles have gone
down. Russia is now the Enemy. No
longer marvellous are the Red soldiers
and the “girl guerrillas” who, between in-
tervals of plastering their jfeces and having
hair-dos, brought down two Germans for
every bullet they fired. It has become
Necessaiy to Stand Up to Moscow. But
the writing boys and radio oracles are
unable to draw comfort from the fact that
Moscow’s performances, in small things
and great, are merely silly.
There was the Communist Greek threat
to stop the delivery of that age-old sym-
bol the Olympic flame to the Games in
London. There was the excommunication
of Tito because he turned nationalist — as
if Stalin did not turn nationalist and in-
voke the shades of Peter the Great and
Ivan the Terrible when the Germans were
at the gates of Leningrad and Moscow.
And there was the idiotic food blockade
of Berlin, the only effect of which has
been to drive the entire German nation,
the Communist rabble excepted, into the
amis of British and Americans and seal
bitter memories of the raping and mur-
dering Russians who, in a, moment of
madness, were permitted to precede the
politician-stalled Anglo-American armies
into Berlin and Prague. For, by a great
exhibition of Anglo-American resource-
fulness and generosity, the people aban-
doned to starvation by the Oriental
savages from the steppes have been fed.
Above all, there was the Great Double
Cross of August, 1939 —Stalin’s treaty
with Hitler. From a war on two fronts the
Germans might have recoiled. Certainly
many of the generals would have been
against it, knowing that Germany was not
prepared for such a war—survivors re-
vealed at Nuremberg that they had only
23 divisions on the Western Front. But
Stalin was so infernally clever that he
signed up with Hitler. So the war came,
the war that Stalin hoped to escape and
to profit by while dooming Britain to
destruction ; and it brought on his Russia
greater losses and miseries than were
suffered by any other combatant, for the
most part incurred in taking the shock
off the British he hated and still hates.
The Bulletin has never had any illu-
sions about Communists. Whether they
try to wreck Europe or Australia, it has
all along had the conviction that their
“philosophy,” which so commends itself
to Mr. Chifley and Mr. Holloway, is in
action a mixture of ruffianism and
stupidity. And the combination will
be their downfall in the end.
Not Martyrs—Mugs.
Back in April the Hanlon Government in
Queensland, with a big strike on its hands,
rushed through an anti-picketing law
which broke the strike and involved a
bunch of Communist leaders, some with
sore heads after encounters with the
police, in fines for breaches of the new
law.
When things quietened down Hanlon,
aware that the strike had cost the
State about £2O million, and apparently
anxious to keep everybody at work, and
not, as a Labor Premier, offend the
unions, repealed the anti-picketing legis-
lation. The Communists, mistaking
this for the same sort of weakness they
meet in Sydney and Canberra, said
they wouldn’t pay the fines. Last week
Queensland police appeared and ran in
M. Healy, president of the Labor Council,
E. C. Englart, secretary of Brisbane
wharfies, Max Julius, a barrister —all
Communists—and a couple of lesser
lights for not paying fines running into
about £lOOO.
A howl of wounded vanity and rage
burst from Communists all over the Com-
monwealth. Hanlon was called upon to
free the Comrades or have his State
blockaded, Australia was threatened with
a general strike, there were to be stop-
works and heaven knows what all over
the place. But unionists, even in Commo-
run unions, displayed a strange reluctance
to down tools. They seemed to think, like
so many others, that Healy, Englart, Julius
and the rest had asked for it. Except on
the Sugar Coast there were no slopworks,
and Hanlon refused to interfere with the
processes of the law.
The Comrades appealed to Mr. Chifley.
For once it was something beyond the
reach of him or his “fixers.” Six days
have passed. When this went to the
printer a meeting of Commo union bosses
was being held in Sydney, but “no line
of action” had been dgcided. The jailed
Commos thought they would be regarded
as martyrs. Most people regard them
as being in their rightful place at last.
A Budget of Frustration.
Premier Playford, presenting his Budget
last week, rediscovered for South Aus-
tralians a fact known to some of them
and to all the Premiers for some time,
namely, that Mr. Chifley, in his capacity
of Commonwealth Treasurer in control
of reimbursements to the States under
uniform taxation, can determine whether
or not a State shall balance its Budget.
And it must have come as a shock to
realise that, whereas in 1938-39 of all
income tax gathered in S.A. the State
got 72 p.c., in 1947-48 the State’s share
was below 22 p.c., Canberra grabbing
the other 78 p.c.
What with the 40-hour week, increased
wages bills and heavier costs all round,
S.A. is up for £21.3 million this year,
estimated expenditure being over £2 mil-
lion more than was actually spent last
year, Mr. Playford looks for a revenue
of £2l} million, nearly £2} million above
actual revenue last year, leaving ah esti-
mated deficit of £90,000 ; but he had to
admit that he was being optimistic about
some things.
He is looking for £2,634,000 from
purely State taxation —£348,000 more
than last year—much of it to come from
motor taxes. Because Mr. Chifley is
grimly hanging on to most of the enor-
mous petrol-tax revenue and because
S.A. roads must be kept in some sort
of repair, motor-owners are to lose the
25 p.c. concession in registration fees.
He looks for an extra £250,000 from the
railways, but the attainment depends
“largely on a good wheat harvest and
continuous and adequate supplies of coal
from N.S.W.”
All expenditure votes are up. On all
State departments the shadow of Can-
berra’s muddling and squandermania falls
darkly. Everywhere he turns —and he
has practical ideas for developing his
State—Mr. Playford must be feeling the
impact of the Chifley policy of “giving
the workers all they ask for” and the
effect of the Communist conspiracy to
halt production and paralyse wherever
possible the normal life of industry.
The normally polite Premier had some
difficulty in restraining himself when it
came to Commonwealth grants:
The tax-reimbursement now being re-
ceived by South Australia is less than we
would have received from our own income
tax if we reduced our pre-war rate by
half 1 regard the future of grants with
great concern. The Grants Commission has
hinted that it will shortly revert to its
pre-war method of assessing grants on the
basis of the budgetary results actually
achieved by the three larger States. That
was reasonable enough when the States had
practically full control of their Budgets
through the right to income taxation. Now,
however, the Federal Treasurer can deter-
mine whether the three larger States shall
be able to balance or not.
Nor could he let the opportunity pass
without reminding South Australians that
the greatest direct and indirect contri-
butor to rising prices is high Common-
wealth taxation. Stating that the £420
million of tax-money which flooded the
Federal coffers in the financial year just
ended represented almost 30 p.c. of all
personal and company incomes, he
pointed out that £233 million of that was
income and social-services tax-money, and
was five times greater than total State
and Federal income tax for 1938-39,
It is plain enough that the State’s
finances, at a time when Common-
wealth revenue is flourishing, are in a
dependent condition. It will be charged
against Premier Playford by his “Labor”
opponents that he is using Canberra as
a blind for his own faults as an adminis-
trator. But that won’t bother him. The
man has - stood up too solidly and too
frequently to the Chifleys to have any
delusions about their quality. What
must gall him, as it galls every other
Australian anxious for tho'progress of the
country, is that this feeble and narrow
Federal “Government” may last long
enough to push us to ruin in a period
when, given half a chance, we could leap
forward 50 years in 10.
The Danube's Significance.
There are two points about the issue of
free navigation on the Danube, concern-
ing which acrimonious debates are now
being reported from the conference at
Belgrade among delegates from the
riparian States and the Great Powers.
Free and equal navigation of the
waterway is the agreed principle not only
under the 1921 agreement, now declared
void by the Soviet, but also under the
Four-Power declaration from the Foreign
Ministers’ Council of December, 1946.
The same principle was written into the
peace treaties with Rumania, Hungary
and Bulgaria, the Soviet protesting.
Recent Russian blocking of similarly
treaty - assured free communications
from all zones of Germany with Berlin
is significant of how Moscow would
treat “free and equal” use of the Danube
under sole Russian control of the riyer.
From Linz downward it has for some
time blocked all non-Soviet shipping.
Before the war the Danube carried
annually from seven to eight million tons
of domestic and foreign trade up and
down its stream. It is a vital trade artery
in the heart of Europe. Resumption of
this trade is regarded as a prime neces-
sity under the European Recovery Pro-
gramme, the directors of which plan to
increase the 1948 land-borne volume of
east-west trade by 80 per cent. The rail-
ways cannot alone accommodate this
traffic ; the Danube must be called in for
its natural job of work.
The Russians’ stand is only one more
instance of their obstruction of European
recovery.

opposite—for the most part “Repealed,
1946.”
In effect there is no more local option.
As a result, there is a boom in applica-
tions for transfers of licences from over-
pubbed districts to districts which have
no pubs or whose alcoholic needs, if any,
are already well- or over-supplied. It is
another threat to the shelterless and to
those whose shelter will be razed to the
ground to accommodate drinking-shops.
And transfer of a licence from a used-up
tavern in a dingy neighborhood to a
middle-class suburb in which there are
many homes imparts to it an immensely
increased value which presumably goes
to Bung or the brewery.
A transfer to Mosman, which has two
pubs (quite enough), was refused by the
Licensing Court, though no doubt the
applicant will come again. Another was
granted to publess Cremorne, though had
local option been preserved it wouldn’t
get a 20 per cent. vote. An application
for still another, stuck up on “a block
of flats opposite the post-office,” has
evoked the hostility of the inhabitants
of publess Lindfield, where W. M. Hughes
lives.
“Labor” has done some putrid things
during the last few years, but scarcely
anything more putrid than its hole-and-
corner repeal of local option.
POLITICAL POINTS
McGirr has done quite a lot of mind-
changing over price-control. Last year
he was certain his State could effectively
control prices if Canberra left the field.
At referendum-time he was equally sure,
like Chifley, that the States could not do
the job. Confronted with the huge “No”
majority, he was convinced that N.S.W.,
at any rate, could do it not only for a
period, but for all time. When his Prices
Bill came before the Assembly an Op-
position amendment providing for a re-
view after six months was refused, but in
the Council last week the term of the bill
was limited to 12 months. The Assembly
will chew this over this week. One of
McGirr’s own henchmen said of land-
sales control that it was making law-
abiding citizens careless and indifferent
about the law. The same argument ap-
plies to all out-dated price-controls.
The U.N.O. Trusteeship Council
has questioned Ward’s proposals for
amalgamating Papua and Mandated New
Guinea in a single Administration, and
“urges caution” with the scheme as
“compromising the preservation of the
separate identity of the trust territory.”
Nobody has ever supposed that “caution”
was Ward’s middle name. The T.C.’s cate-
gory of increased benefits desirable for
the natives includes schools, “chances
of” self-government, medical facilities,
and social and economic benefits. Ward
can say he has already O.K.’d some of
these as departmental suggestions, but
apparently to the U.N.O. critics the whole
tone of native uelift he has in mind lacks
something in timbre.
Chifley in reminiscent mood:
I remember the circuses when I was a
boy and I loved them. I haven’t been for
many years, but I could go again and enjoy
it just as much.
Hasn’t been for many years? What on
earth does the man call the show he’s
been running in Canberra all this time?
A great shipbuilding authority turned
up in Brisbane the other day to assure
Queenslanders that they would be build-
ing ships for the next 10 years at least,
and “programmes would be launched to
maintain full employment.” He is A.
S, McAlpine, chairman of the Australian
Shipbuilding Board, His qualifications
for the job are that he is president of the
A.L.P. Queenslanders, a rather polite
people, didn’t ask him what use it was
building ships to be laid idle at the
orders of the Seamen’s and Wharfies’
unions.
While McAlpine was promising a
bright future for Australian shipbuilding
the launching of a ship built at Williams-
town (Vic.) had to be postponed through
a “black” ban imposed by the Painters
and Dockers, as a reminder to a
“Labor” Minister that his job was to
do as he was told. The vessel held up
was not designed to earn wealth for
millionaire shipowners; it was a Navy
destroyer built for the defence of Aus-
tralia. McAlpine has not been heard
from on the subject.
A latitude station is to be established
in Adelaide. Its functions will not in-
clude a determination of the latitude per-
mitted to Communists to hold up pro-
duction, determine foreign policy and
generally run the country. That will still
be left to Canberra “fixers.”
Cosgrove is making much of his in-
tention to press for the ending of uniform
taxation at the Premiers’ Conference on
August 24 —three days after the Tas-
manian electorate sends his Government
packing. It is electioneering talk, of
course, but a weak line, as he is merely
putting into effect a motion passed by
the Speck Assembly six months ago and
introduced by the Opposition. In the
intervening period Cosgrove has done
nought about recovering State rights,
though he did support the Chifley bid
for more power for Canberra.
A party of 20 union officials is to visit
the rocket-range towards the end of the
month “to study working conditions and
wage-rates.” It is intended that members
of the party shall be “checked before be-
ing issued with a pass for the area.” If
some officials of the Commo-controlled
8.W.1.U. nominate for the trip they
should be double-checked and issued with
a pass-out.
McGirr went up to Newcastle last
week to meet union officials and
discuss (with the press excluded) prob-
lems of the coal industry,. He met a
team of them, but it didn’t include any
miners’ representatives. The Federation’s
excuse was that its officials were in Syd-
ney “in negotiations for a settlement of
disputes in the industry.” In actual fact
they were engaged in refusing to consider
a settlement and in threatening a com-
plete hold-up if they couldn’t get their
own way. And McGirr and Ashley sub-
sequently saw that they got it.
German experts have given their
opinion that the production of gas from
Victorian brown coal is a practical pro-
position, though they recommend the
establishment of a large-scale test-plant
before any complete scheme is adopted.
Already independent of N.S.W. coal for
electric-power output, it looks as if Vic-
torians will soon be able to .shake the
N.S.W, coalminers off their backs in the
matter of gas, too.
Last November N.S.W. Legislative
Council refused to pass the Cahill Local
Government Strangulation Bill and
referred it to a select committee. Cahill
had intended to reduce the 66 areas of
the County of Cumberland to 16 —against
the wishes of the majority of councils
concerned and without giving the people
a chance to vote on the subject. The
select committee’s report recommends 41
area. The Minister has been busily
engaged in the meantime “amalgamating”
country councils against their will, build-
ing up a store of resentment in the
process.
Australia’s dollar deficit with North
America for 1947-48 was £42 million, £9
million worse than in the previous year.
But Canberra has allocated $1,189,110
to a Sydney promotion, Metropolitan
Portland Cemeht, Ltd., for the purchase
of American plant. A new Maoriland.
cement co. is getting its machinery from
Britain. On the board of the Sydney
float is Raymond G. Hamilton, State
“Labor” M.L.A. for Namoi, who, accord-
ing to “Hansard,” was “granted leave of
absence for the remainder of the session
from March 10, 1948, on account of
absence from the State.” Metropolitan
Cement’s bankers are the Rural Bank of
N. S. Wales.
President Truman’s path continues to
be strewn with thorns. At the week-end
Senator Ferguson, chairman of the com-
mittee investigating the Communist spy-
ring, said;
Truman’s arrogance is becoming intoler-
able. Congress is rapidly being pushed into
the intolerable position of having either to
legislate through a blind spot or compel the
President to answer for his conduct in
impeachment proceedings.
The attack must be read in the light of
the Presidential elections, only three
months off. Only one U.S. President has
been impeached —Andrew Johnson, who,
in 1868, was charged by a hostile Re-
publican Congress with violating the
Tenure of Office Act. He was acquitted ;
the necessary two-thirds majority failed
by one vote.
With 37,000,000 bushels of wheat await-
ing transport in N.S.W., and the new
harvest barely three months away, H. S.
Roberton, of Old Junee, believes the
prospect is “appalling.” “But,” says he,
“no one in authority is appalled, and no
one in authority is hungry.” Roberton
isn’t impressed by the usual excuses. He
puts it down to “a lack of intention.”
And “if the harvest cannot be moved
within the limits of leisurely labor, then
the harvest can rot. That is the attitude.”
It applies with equal force to the sugar
crop.
McGirr says the wheat will be at the
ports “by Christmas.” This awakens
memories of Forde’s promise to the
Diggers in 1945—“ You’ll be home for
Christmas” —and farmers are already
singing: “But only in your dreams.”
Now that the Ashley-McGirr combina-
tion has Tfixed” yet another threatened
coal strike by getting Coal Board action
again deferred, on a renewed assur-
ance from the miners’ Communist bosses
that they will themselves discipline their
rebels, it remains ta be seen what will
arise from the recent agreement
between Clarey (A.C.T.U.) and Com-
munist Williams to endorse as “the
real solution of the coal problem” the
miners’ claims for nationalisation, a 35-
hour week, and new homes for miners
in the mine areas. The A.C.T.U. also
promises to take the stump “to
acquaint the Australian people with the
true situation on the coalfields,” in order
to combat propaganda “used by the
Liberal and Country parties to attack the
‘Labor’ Governmeent.” Somebody ought
to be fueling a draught soon.
They continue to find strange disguises
for the word “depression.” To the Prime
Minister it is “recession,” to a Melbourne
professor it is “down-turn.” Now an-
other Melbourne professor (of Com-
merce) calls it “relevant elements point-
ing away from a continuation of the pre-
sent prosperity in Australia.” He blames
declining output, the 40-hour week, rising
costs and sundry other things. Blunter
characters sum it all up in one word —
Chifleyism.
Thursday is payday on Brisbane
wharves; Saturday is race-day. Ship-
owners have been considering not
working ships in Brisbane on these
two days because of the number of
wharfies who turn up drunk after pay-
day and following the races. Of course a
vociferous Watersiders’ Federation official
screamed that it was a pack of lies. One
wharfie knows better. He turned up
drunk', Was refused access to the job by
an elderly wharf supervisor, violently
assaulted the w.s, and was fined £2O.
Police said that only their intervention
saved the old man from serious injury.
Queensland local authorities are join-
ing in the yell for more money from the
petrol tax. Like the shires and muni-
cipalities in the south they can’t main-
tain existing roads or build new ones
unless they get it. They’ll get cold com-
fort from Canberra, where the tax (10id.
a gallon) is regarded as “primarily
a revenue impost,” though it was pri-
marily imposed for the maintenance and
building of roads.
The Vic. Country party has given
away the notion of penalising road trans-
port to bolster up failing State railways.
Describing country rail services as “un-
satisfactory and obsolete,” the C.P. is
asking its Ministers in the Hollway Gov-
ernment to “liberalise” road transport in
an “open-road” policy. This sort of thing
has been inevitable; the wonder is
that it has taken so long for politicians
of any color to see the light.
Discovering that the owner of a tiny
tea-hut in the bush at the back of a golf
course had to have five different licences
to function legally, a thoughtful chap set
out to list the things a citizen couldn’t
dd without a licence or permit. He is
rapidly becoming a neuropathological
case.
In reply to requests for a simplified in-
come-tax system Chifley replied that
“most taxpayers would not be prepared
to forgo equity for the sake of simplicity.”
But if a taxpayer can’t check his assess-
ment —and with that Chinese puzzle at
present masquerading as an assessment
who can? —how can he know whether he
is getting equity? The reaction of the
average taxpayer is to assume he is not.
and that the method of assessing is pur-
posely complicated in order to conceal the
fact. One eminent legal authority at least
agrees with him.
There has been some kind of a chang-
ing of the Russian guard in Berlin;
Sokolovsky, we are told, now plays second
fiddle to Rokossovsky, It sounds like
the old Box and Cox farce.
Annual conference of the Queensland
local-government authorities has t re-
jected a motion advocating new States,
but several shires and municipalities have
strong views on the subject. Mayor
Wood, of Mackay, believes in separation
from Brisbane as the only hope for full
development of the North. His city’s
attempt to have a swamp area drained
was “frustrated by higher authorities,” he
said, apd had apparently been shelved
“until a depression comes.” People at
any distance from the seat of govern-
ment are accustomed to “having their
aspirations frustrated by higher authori-
ties.”
Eager and willing a few months ago to
sing songs of Araby—Palestine pattern—
Dr. Evatt so far has shown no signs of
telling tales of old Kashmir. But he’ll
probably get round to it at any moment.
A clergyman, a former president, has
resigned from the Australian-Russian
Society “in the interests of personal in-
tegrity and because of my unwillingness
to be associated in the remotest way with
Communism.” His awakening has not
shaken the faith of Clive Evatt, president
of the society. McGirr’s Minister for
Laying Foundation-stones protested: “It
is false to suggest that it is Communist-
controlled or in any way Communistic.”
He mentioned as members of the society
R. A. King, M.L.C., and secretary of the
N.S.W. Trades and Labor Council,
Eddie Ward and Mrs. Jessie Street,
adding, “Incidentally, Sir Laurence
Olivier is a member of the society in
England the British-Soviet Society,
which is also non-political.” Olivier
immediately disclaimed membership;
King, Ward and Jessie said nothing.
It has come out that one of the 15
Russian-bom wives kept by force from
joining their husbands in Britain is serv-
ing a two-year jail sentence. It’s any-
body’s guess what has happened to the
other 14.
As an earnest of its intention to get
rid of controls as soon as it is practi-
cable to do so the Victorian Government
is calling its Prices chief the Prices-De-
control Commissioner.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Visitors from England these days might
admit the Old Country is in a bit of a
ditch, but they also stress their belief
in J. Bull’s ability to climb out.
Latest is Viscount Davidson, describ-
ing himself at a Millions Club
luncheon in Sydney as “an innocent from
abroad.” An innocent he may be, but
it’s not through lack of experience—he
has held successfully scores of high public
offices, among them Secretary of State for
Colonies, President of the Board of Trade,
Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty,
chairman of a Goodwill Mission to Irak
and Syria, and, at present, chairman of
directors of the A.M.L. and F. With
wide experience also in employer-worker
relationship, Davidson believes that “full
employment,” in its beneficial sense, de-
pends not merely oh placing every man
in a job, but on seeing that every man
appreciates that his own success is closely
bound with that of the business employ-
ing him; and that until every workman
is imbued with a sense of responsibility to
his job and the nation he is only raw
material for the more important role of
citizen. All sound stuff —as sound, as
his belief that if Australia and the rest of
the Commonwealth remain true to the
British tradition in this world of ideo-
logical materialism the Empire will stand
like a tower.
Melbourne may have its own Boys’
Town, run on similar lines to the one
founded by Father Dunlea at Engadine,
near Sydney. While the founder was in
Melbourne recently to discuss the project
he made an unexpected reacquaintance
with Michael Edward Rooney— not
the Rooney of Hollywood, but an
Australian with a history uncannily re-
sembling screen fiction. This Rooney was
16 when Father Dunlea met him and
plucked him out of Sydney slumdom.
The third boy to enter Boys’ Town, he
fulfilled his namesake’s film story by
being elected Mayor, Two years later he
joined the R.A.A.F., and after discharge
took,to singing. Haydn James, of the
A.8.C., enlisted him among his tenors for
the grand-opera chorus. He is now re-
hearsing for the chorus of the Italian
Grand Opera season at His Majesty’s,
Melbourne.
Two young Sydney ex-servicemen, Don
Martin and Douglas Hardy, of Southern
Cross Film Productions, are doing as
much as all D. 0.1, to sell Australia
overseas. Official war photographers
in the Middle East and island cam-
paigns, they first met in Cairo, just before
Alamein. Martin, a “still” photographer,
learnt movie work in the desert deputising
for a sick cine-man. From recording
battle scenes, of which Martin took over
14,000 photos, they turned after the war
to documentaries of Australian life,
among them one of an 18-footers’ race
on Sydney Harbor called “Nor’-Easter.”
This is the film that was reported as
packing Londoners into full-length
pictures they’d already seen. It brought
Hardy the Australian Short Film Award
for 1947, presented by the Vic. branch
of the Royal Empire Society. With
its commentary translated into nine
languages “Nor’-Easter” is now showing
in Europe. Martin recently published an
Australian Book of Trains; the object of
both young Diggers is to show the world
there is more in Australia than Commos
and strikes.
H. E. Coles, who on retiring has made
the unusual gesture of transferring the
goodwill of his business, the largest sight-
testing and opticians’ concern in the
Southern Hemisphere, to 18 senior mem-
bers of his executive, founded the firm of
Coles and Garrard in Bourke-street, Mel-
bourne. He began as a boy with Alfred
Nott, optician, and 10 years later
founded his own business, which now
has a staff of 70, a branch at Geelong
and 250 visiting country centres. Only
55, before he made his gesture he refused
an offer by a sharebroking firm to float
his business into a. public company,
whereby he would have netted thousands
of pounds. The new company will re-
tain him as governing-director. Coles
and Garrard are optical suppliers to
the Navy, Army and Air Force.
To be created a Bard of the Gorsedd
is a signal honor —the body which con-
trols the great Welsh Eisteddfods and Cel-
tic cultural affairs generally doesn’t toss
it around lightly. Only two Australians
have been so honored, both of them,
strangely enough. South Australians: the
BARD.
late Langdon Bonython of Adelaide
“Advertiser” and singer Clement Hos-
king, and the look of surprise which
Dubois has captured here from the latter’s
physiognomy sprang from the office poet’s
asking him what bit of verse he won it
with. For the uninitiated, be it known
that one is made a Bal'd by the Gorsedd
for any outstanding contribution to Celtic
culture, Clement, who is a Cacialli-
trained basso cantante and is also widely
renowned as a singing teacher now long
resident in Sydney, made the study of
folk - music his specialty, and to
this end invaded bleak outposts of
Scotland and the Outer Hebrides to
rescue old songs which, handed down
from generation to generation from
Druid times, were in danger of being
lost for ever. Recognised as one of the
world’s experts in. folklore in its relation
to songs, Clement runs his own Folk-
Song Choir, a well-trained band of
songsters who browse not only on Celtic
folk-songs but range all Europe for their
liltings. He is also president of the
Folk Lore Association and president of
the Celtic Society of N.S.W. Newington
College’s fine choir owes its excellence to
his skilled tonal architecture.
“Cauboy”: The biggest draw in one
outstanding Italian grand opera season
was an Australian, John Brownlee, Gee-
long emptied itself into Melbourne every
night its baritone son was singing. This
year’s outbreak will be distinguished by
the inclusion of six principals belonging
to Australia and New Zealand. Maxwell
Cohen, the burly baritone who made a
magnificent Ethiopian king in the
National Theatre Movement’s presenta-
tion of “Aida” at the Princess, Melbourne,
and Jean Campbell, coloratura soprano,
are well known in Melbourne. Lorenzo
Nolan, a lyric tenor who studied under
Adolf Spivakovsky after hitch-hiking
from Queensland, paying his way by sing-
ing in the streets en route, is leading tenor
with Krips’s “Singers of Australia” in
Sydney. Wilma Whitney, contralto, is a
violinist with the Melbourne Symphony
Orchestra as well as a singer who has
won four scholarships at the Melba Con-
servatorium. Soprano Carmencita Mas-
cagni played Musette in “La Boheme” in
the J.C.W. imperial opera season. Dra-
matic soprano Eleanor Houston hails
from New Zealand.
Dr. G. K. Williams, retired this month
from managership of Port Pirie Broken
Hill Associated Smelters, is one of Aus-
tralia’s most brilliant engineers. Starting
as a metallurgical student at Pirie in 1921,
he advanced to manager through personal
experience of all phases of lead smelting
and perfected a continuous process of
refining which, revolutionising the in-
dustry, required overall remodelling of
the smelters. From the time the ore
reaches Pirie until it is dumped into the
ship’s hold as lead pigs, its journey is
wholly mechanical. This process made
Williams famous in the non-ferrous
metal world, his thesis tracing its stages
winning him a doctorate of engineering.
Williams leaves this month for Bristol,
to become consultant metallurgist to
Imperial Smelting Corporation—an indi-
cation of his ability when the industrial
eminence of England is considered. He
is not lost to Australian industry; he’ll
be back, with experience gained, in three
years’ time.
Eric Nicol, formerly of Christchurch
and Dunedin (M.L.), now of Los
Angeles, and a naturalised citizen of the
U.S.A., has been appointed Director of
Organisation and Personnel of the Atomic
Energy Commission. His war-time job
was on the War Production and Lend-
Lease Agency; since the war he has
been vice-president in charge of person-
nel with the United Rexall Drug Co. of
Los Angeles. He left M.L. 20 years ago
to study at Columbia University.
“Ek D.’s” reminiscence:
Dead in Canada, at 66, Frederick Baldwin,
the first man to fly in the British Common-
wealth. I saw a lot of him and his father-in-
law, Dr. Graham Bell, inventor of the tele-
phone, when they came to Sydney in 1910 to
buy the Hargrave flying models for the Smith-
sonian Institute. The errand was fruitless.
Hargrave told us he had offered them to the
New South Wales Government and had not
even had a reply to his letter. They had lain
for months in a boatshed attached to his Pi.
Piper home, and then an enthusiastic German
had turned up and bagged them for the Munich
industrial museum, which put up a special bay
in which I saw them many years later. One
highlight of the Bell-Baldwin visit was a trip
to Stanwell Park so that Hargrave could point
out the spot from which he launched his models.
The party formed a remarkable group—the
man who made it possible to send speech over
a wire (Scottish), the man who had solved the
problem of mechanical flight (Australian), and
the man who had made the first flight in the
British Empire (Canadian), all assembled on the
spot on which flying, to all practical intents
and purposes, had been born. And nobody
thought of taking a photograph!
Bigger even than he looks in the cari-
cature, Commander Beresford Marks is
Director of Training and Staff Require-
ments at Navy Office, Melbourne. A
gunnery officer with the usual accom-
plishments, he has just been promoted to
his present rank, but will still be known
indiscriminately to his colleagues as
Boomer and Harpo—and to ordinary sea-
men of cruiser Australia as the “nurse”
who took them, as officer of division, up
to Cairo for a never-to-be-forgotten
week-end in 1935. Before his present ap-
pointment Marks was Squadron Gunnery
Officer in Sydney, butt of all the ques-
tions the Fleet brought in after a shoot
that should have straddled but didn’t
scare the target. Billy Hughes was a
great friend of his father, and made him
Minister of External Affairs in 1920. The
son is treading in his father’s footsteps,
though not on political bypaths; Marks,
GUNNER.
Senr., was a lieutenant in the R.N.V.R,
when the Kaiser broke loose, and he saw
service on the English, Scottish, French
and Belgian coasts and in the Atlantic.
In Sydney he was a keen yachtsman.
H. C, W. Bennett, Catering Superinten-
dent for A.N.A., should know his job.
Educated at Sydney Barker College,
Bennett joined Burns Philp in 1929, spent
three years at head office, and at 19 was
assistant-purser to a Pacific Islands ship.
After further purser duties with Mc-
Ilwraith McEacharn, he graduated as
purser in the Katoomba, trading on the
Australian coast and. pleasure-cruising in
the Pacific. Back with B.P. in 1938, he
became providore for the firm at Suva,
and was managing the Hotel Metropole
there when the war broke. Returning
to Australia and awaiting appointment
to the Navy, he was a relieving purser
with Q.E.A. before joining the White
Star line as shipping superintendent, re-
sponsible for manning the two Queens,
Aquitania and Mauretania for convoy
work. When the Japs came in he was
commissioned in the R.A.N. and served
in Intelligence on special duties with the
U.S. Navy Submarine Task Force 71. In
1946 he took his present job with A.N.A.
Registered half-a-century making
umbrellas for Melbourne winters, 64-
year-old Bill North has a moustache
which was the envy of every R.A.A.F.
fighter pilot during the war. On his
14th birthday he began making umbrellas
in the London workshop of Grant Bar-
nett. That was in 1898. After four
years he was sent to Sydney to the firm’s
new shop, and 1905 to Melbourne.
Today his grandson, 15-year-old Kevin
Walsh, is. learning the trade from him.
New Vacuum Oil marketing-director
for Australia and Pacific Islands is J. D.
Rogers, Returning from the first scrap
with M.C. and Belgian Croix de Guerre,
he completed a science course at Mel-
bourne Uni. and joined Vacuum Oil as
Chief Chemist for N.S.W. in 1923. Ap-
pointed assistant-g.m. for Westralia in
1930, he came back to a similar position
in N.S.W. five years later. After six
months’ research in America he joined-
up again in 1939 and served throughout
the war, finishing as brigadier and director
of military intelligence, with C.B.E. and
0.8. E. Recently chairman of Legacy’s
War Orphans’ Appeal committee, Rogers
is also president of. the Imperial Service
Club.
Vic. R.A.S., which is to celebrate its
100th show in Melbourne in September,
is catering to dog-lovers by bringing out
as a judge J. W. Marples, one of Eng-
land’s best-known dog men. He is the
eldest son of that Theo Marples who for
30 years edited “Our Dogs,” the dog
paper of England, and is himself the
author of a standard work on prepar-
ing dogs for show, as well as other dog
literature. A Fellow of the Royal Zoo-
logical Society, he runs “Our Dogs”
when not galloping about the world look-
ing at other people’s hounds.
Into the silence;
In Melbourne, Howard Kingsley Love, radio
pioneer. He was a foundation member and
first Federal president of the Wireless Institute
of Australia. A pilot-officer in World War I,
he was shot down behind the German lines.
Between wars he organised radio amateurs who,
forming a reserve for the R.A.A.F., did a good
job in the last scrap.
At Hastings (Vic.), at 94, John Barclay,
Victoria’s oldest fisherman and oldest resident
on Momington Peninsula. Aged five, he went
with his family from Melbourne by the fish-
cart mail to Hastings, then the State’s leading
fishing port. He was unique among fishermen
in voicing his opinion that destruction of
Western Port’s seals would not help fishing.
In Melbourne, at 87, Dr. Frederick John
Howell, Ph.D., pioneer in the use of super-
phosphate on Victorian pastures. He was in-
structor in scientific agriculture for the Victorian
Government and one of the original chemists
with the Department of Agriculture. In 1911
he published Soil Problems in Wheatgrowing,
dedicated to Farrer, the wheat-breeder.
At Dunedin, at 76, Harman Reeves, one of
M.L.’s oldest sharebrokers. He was consular
agent for the U.S.A., and assisted Admiral
Byrd on his 1927 expedition.
At Torquay, England, Harry Brearley, whose
discovery how to make steel stainless turned
him into a* Sheffield magnate and earned him
the blessing of housewives the world over.
Secret of his discovery has been given by the
inventor to the Cutler’s Co. of Sheffield, under
seal, to be opened at its annual dinner in 1960.
In Melbourne, at 89, Henry Hutchinson, one
of the oldest surviving Cobb and Co. coach-
drivers.
At sea, en route to U.S.A., B. Mager Steele,
finance director of Goodyear Tyres. He had
been with the company for 22 years, nine of
them in Australia.
In Sydney, at 76, Clifton Penny, for 30 years
a lawyer specialising in criminal cases.
In Sydney, at 65, Nigel Barker, N.S.W.
Rugby Union rep. and one of Australia’s fastest
sprinters. At the 1906 Olympics in Athens he
ran third in both the 100 and 400 metres. At
home he set Australian records for practically
every distance from 75 yards up. His record
for 200 metres, put up in Queens-
land in 1908, still stands.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS "
“Lao-dah”: Nothing has reassured me
as to the soundness of the core of the
Empire more than the cabled announce-
ment that the Duke of Marlborough at 50
can take a handful of raspberries, toss
them one by one to the ceiling and
catch them in his mouth. Princess Mar-
garet and other “young socialites,” accord-
ing to the “Age’s” correspondent, were
fascinated by this display of the duke’s
virtuosity, but the duchess told them that
was nothing—the Duke could do it just
as well in the Great Hall of Blenheim
Palace, where the ceilings are twice as
high. It is reasonable to doubt if the first
Marlborough could have done it, though
he was pretty good at winning battles,
as well as applying public money to
private purposes, one of which was the
building of Blenheim Palace with its
stately ceilings,

“Spokeshave”: The debate between
cricket critics as to whether Bradman or
the English captain would have to make
the decision whether to spoil the wicket
for tjje other side by applying the
heavy roller reminds me of a yarn I
read about an Australian boy who had
failed to respond to treatment for anti-
social tendencies and was sent to an Eng-
lish public school. There he made good in
a way that surprised his parents, becoming
the school’s pride and joy for his prowess
as a bowler. At the annual match with
a rival school he excelled himself. When
the last wicket fell he made a 'blind rush
for the ball, but was intercepted by his
delighted schoolmates, who chaired him
from the field despite his frantic protests.
It then turned out that he had conceived
the ingenious idea of boring a hole in
the ball and depositing a lump of lead
inside. I leave it to the sports to
decide whether his contravention of the
rules was any more unethical than the
suggested observing of them in the recent
Test match.

“Wak”: Listening to a Test-match
broadcast recently, I was treated to a
description of the evasive antics of yet
another “little dog on the field,” The
hearty laughter from my radio told that
the English tyke was not lowering the
professional standards kept by his Aus-
tralian contemporaries. That these doggy
interludes are indispensable to the real
enjoyment of cricket I have no doubt,
but I can’t help suspecting that some
enterprising radio-commentator smuggles
a carefully-trained animal on to the
ground and has it released at the right
moment so that he can fascinate his audi-
ence with an eloquent but nicely-prepared
account of the performance,

“Col M.”: Chalking his way along
George-street, Sydney, taking an occa-
sional number, and looking a picture of
portly satisfaction, the parking police-
man suddenly pulled up with a jerk.
Right in his path of duty was an amphibi-
ous jeep, painted in gleaming silver and
with a background of smiling citizens.
After a tentative recce for signs of tyres,
the parking bloke covered his confusion
by staring with mock interest into the
wheelhouse. A close observer might
have seen the chalk snap in his fingers,
and the man could not have been blamed
if he’d hurled it way. Then, noting a
baby car resting quietly just ahead, he
pounced upon the midget and made its
wheels look white.

“Ceg”: I would like to try that young-
ster who likes castor-oil (B. 21/7/’4B)
on the contents of a family medicine-
chest of 50 years ago. There was
Gregory’s Powder, a mixture of powdered
rhubarb-root with one or two other
minor ingredients. It wouldn’t dissolve
and was as hard to get down as sawdust.
Nastiest of all was senna tea —I attribute
my skill as a wrestler to that particular
nostrum. Liquorice-powder wasn’t so
bad —it had a sweetish taste —but, com-
pared with those I’ve mentioned, castor-
oil with a little orange-juice is a drink
for the gods. Kids today just don’t
know they’re alive when it comes to
medicines. Even toothpaste is so attrac-
tive that I know of a boy who ate the
best part of a tube, but I never heard
‘I'll hold your baby , Missus; I’m a married man myself
of any of my contemporaries eating car-
bolic-powder, which is about all we ever
saw.
“South Coast”: Kids and castor-oil?
At one of our exclusive schools half a
dozen juniors came down in their pyjamas
one night and asked the matron for a
big spoonful of castor-oil each. What
for? Had they been eating stale pies or
green gooseberries? Nothing like that.
All they wanted was a big dose of castor-
oil —with no orange or anything to get
it down with. Matron brought the bottle,
prepared to call their bluff. But the
kids swallowed it without a shudder —
to win a bet with another kid who said
they couldn’t do it.

“Ray Whiting”; We met a young Yank
in Beirut one morning who insisted on
starting a party and paying for every-
thing—not that he had to insist very
hard. After several spectacular days and
nights, sampling all the town had to offer
and moving everywhere by taxi, one
bloke suggested to our host that he
“must be one of these flaming American
millionaires.” “No, bud,” he replied. “I
guess I haven’t a dollar of my own. I’m
a volunteer ambulance-driver, and I sold
the ambulance to a couple of Wogs.”

“Silver Bullet”: It was very frosty
when I boarded a tram about five o’clock
the other morning for a 40-minute
journey. The man sitting opposite me
was dressed up like a Polar explorer,
but he was still shivering. “Br-r-rrr-a! ”
I said. “Cold, isn’t it?” “Don’t know,”
he replied, “I’m too damned numb to
feel it.”

“F.S.”: The strangest case in history
of a writ for wrongful diagnosis has
occurred in London, where an American
consulting engineer got damages from a
distinguished surgeon because he didn’t
fulfil the surgeon’s diagnosis by dying
within a few months. Complainant
alleged that, on the strength of the
diagnosis, he sold up his British business ;
he claimed damages for loss of money or
expectations of eternal felicity or some-
thing. I was once the victim of a similar
diagnosis, an eminent physician informing
me that I had thickening of the meninges
and was doomed to a life of torment
which could only be alleviated by drugs.
I didn’t have thickening of the meninges,
don’t take any drugs—not even Mc-
Kenna’s free ones —and the only torments
from which I suffer come from outside.
When I meet the medico at a play or
concert he seems surprised and slightly
disappointed that I am not in my grave.

“Feng-Shui”: The cabled information
that aeroplanes flying in China will prob-
ably be equipped with grids to stave off
pirates shows that the Chinaman hasn’t
lost his innate ability to adapt himself
to progress. The proposal followed on
the discovery that a passenger-plane which
crashed and left only one survivor had
shipped new-style pirates who tried to
hold the ship up while in mid-air. Unfor-
turiately for them they weren’t sufficiently
up in aviation to know how to keep the
plane from taking a nose-dive after the
pilot, with a bullet in him, had slumped
over the controls. Most ships trading
between Hong Kong and Canton and up
the coast and parts of the Yang-tzse used
to have strong iron grids between the
deck passengers and the bridge, with an
armed Sikh to guard them. The piratical
technique was for members of a gang
to ship as humble coolies with weapons
concealed about them and at a conveni-
ent moment to start shooting. They often
captured the ship in the confusion, and
an innocent-looking junk somewhere in
the offing would come alongside, tran-
ship the loot and make with all speed
to one of the hideouts along the coast
under the protection of local officials.
Some of the pirate settlements carried
populations as large as an Australian
provincial town —all sharing in the profits.

“W.F.G.”: Paintings of old colonial
structures (B. 14/7/’4B) are all very well,
but why not give posterity the actual
buildings? Faced with a similar problem
America completed the restoration of
Williamsburg, Virginia, as a pre-Revolu-
tionary town. With the Wren-designed
William and Mary College as a centre,
Americans can see Williamsburg as it
looked when Washington and Jeffer-
son were active in Virginian affairs. A
few acres of National Park or Kuring-
gai Chase could, be set aside as a per-
manent home for buildings such as the
Mint and Hyde Park Barracks. We can-
not reconstruct a complete town of Mac-
quarie’s day, but we should certainly save
such buildings as are still available.
Whatever we could re-erect on such an
area would be a most valuable adjunct
to the records in the Mitchell Library.
Labor is needed for more urgent work
at the moment; what is called for is
an immediate decision that the old build-
ings will be preserved for transfer to a
suitable site when time and money permit.

“Bo”: My afternoon paper, with an
obsequious respectfulness bordering
almost on reverence, gave its readers
details of the holiday on the N.S.W- Blue
Mountains enjoyed by a notorious gun-
man whose sentence of death for shooting
with intent to murder was commuted to
12 years, but who is out and about again
after serving only a little over three years
of it, allegedly because he has t.b. The
paper’s hero, it' seemed, was joined in
his posh fastness by “an unusually attrac-
tive blonde,” he being “known to the
management as her husband.” A smart
dresser, she was wont to take the hero
for drives each day in her “new cream
car.” With an air of fervent thankful-
ness for a soul uplifted there was con-
veyed also the tidings that the couple
“behaved well” and kept to themselves,
and that the hero, with sternly-imposed
self-discipline, even denied himself the
pleasure of strong drink. But the part I
liked best about the item was the sub-
heading announcement that the hero had
spent his holidays “incognito.” No doubt
in future Royalty and the peerage when
going abroad and wishing privacy will
just “go under another name.”

“Hoop”: I have a report on an
American gentleman who can get his
tongue in a finer knot than any Nor-
wegian or even “F.R.P.’s” Afrikaner (B.
4/8/’4B) over the letter “j.” He began
working in a bank, and was nimbly flick-
ing through wads of notes when the vice-
president noticed the new face and asked
where he had been given his financial
training. “Yale,” was the reply. It
pleased the boss no end, and deciding
that this was a man to watch he asked
his name. The employee proudly told
him “Yackson.”

“Macnell”: Success of Italy’s water-
polo team against Australia in the Games
recalls the time cruiser Australia’s
team challenged the Greek Olympic team
when the ship visited Athens in 1936. We
were pretty proud of our boys and their
success against the Med. Fleet, and the
signalled information that the Greeks
would arrange their own transport out
to where the ship was anchored a couple
of miles offshore awoke no qualms. The
game was to be played between nets
slung from the ship’s side. But when
half a dozen bobbing heads were sighted
approaching from landward, and it was
realised the visitors were swimming to
the arena, we weren’t so smug. Doubts
were justified, the Greeks wiping us
easily before returning the way they
came.

“Uramao”: Some unknown New Zea-
land poet has missed immortality by not
appending his name to his brain-child.
Twenty years ago a scrapbook of Oscar
Wilde was included among others sold
for a song. In it was found a poem sent
from an admirer of Wilde in New Zea-
land, taken from the Catholic weekly
in Dunedin, the N.Z. “Tablet.” A tribute
to Oscar’s “Graffiti d’ltalia,” it opened;
More precious than the learning thou shalt gain
Thy father’s name, thy wealth of youth’s bright
morn,
Anew in thee thy mother’s genius born,
Is the soul’s yearning that doth form thy pain.
Oscar wrote above the verses “Perhaps
by Newman.” Any claimants?

“Tos”: One of our departmental cars
was damaged, and in the report it was
stated that “apparently two of the
cylinders have been ‘missing’.” Our
zealous accountant pounced on this and
wrote a minute to the driver: “These
cylinders must be found before any
further inquiry is made into the damaged
car.”

“Kelms”: A Perth man donated a
£l5OO yacht to be raffled in aid of the
Children’s Hospital, and estimated that
the public would cash in to the tune of
about £3OOO. The State Lotteries Com-
mission, which controls W.A.’s goose
clubs and similar social functions, and
is empowered to limit competition with
its own weekly £3OOO gamble, permitted
the raffle to proceed, the sale of tickets
not to exceed £250. The disgusted donor
repossessed the yacht and gave the hos-
pital the £250. The hospital is waiting
for the Commission to make good the
£2750 it has lost—well, anyway, it’s wait-
ing.

that a motor-hearse in England carried

“Clooter”; One of the show-places of
our suburb is The Gap, an indented cliff
rising sheer some 150 ft. or so above
the Pacific, historically famed for the
wreck of the Dunbar and because the
signal-station above it has welcomed both
the fighting ships of our allies in various
wars and the merchant ships of all
nations in times of peace. However, it
is rather more notorious than famous,
since it has been a favorite leap for
suicides for a generation, losing its popu-
larity only temporarily when jumping
from the Harbor Bridge became the
fashion. On Sundays the place is crowded
with visitors, and the council has late;
constructed a pleasant concrete walk to
accommodate them. About a year ago
a lump of the cliff fell into the sea anc
another larger lump went recently, some-
what altering the contour of the cliff
The other Sunday an excited local dis-
covered the new fall, eyed the new wals
and disgustedly remarked: “Huh! If this
keeps up there’ll be nowhere for ’em to
jump over soon.”
THEN AND NOW.
“The original Olympic Games lasted nearly 1200
years, from 776 n.c. to a.d. 394, when the Roman
Emperor Theodosius banned them as a Pagan exhi-
bition.’'—“Time.”
Pity we couldn’t call some old-time aces
From the Elysian fields to let us know
How to compare our modern leaps and paces
With records they achieved so long ago
In tests of skill and strength and hard-fought
races,
And generally to contrast the show
We’ve lately seen with what the Greeks could
stage
As far away as the Heroic Age.
They did their stuff apparently contented
With greenstuff Chaplets to attest their climbs
To fame, and their attainments complimented
In rustic staves and perishable rhymes.
But, seeing watches hadn’t been invented,
It’s dear that nobody could take the times
In which they ran, nor were statistics kept
Whence one could gauge the distances they
leapt.
No question of what scran was best for training
Came to perturb those ancient devotees
Of sport, least fattening and most sustaining
For athletes’ physical capacities.
Of diet they were never heard complaining
While they could get their whack of fresh-
made cheese
And figs—a menu that might give the pip
To modern aspirants for championship.
No flags or blaring banners were entrusted
To sturdy fans to flaunt on Elis’ plain;
They never saw binoculars adjusted
To follow some grim test of stress and strain.
Nathless the Games went on while Empires
busted
And dynasties were emptied down the drain
Till Roman Theodosius got the spike
And banned the contests as un-Christianlike.
They ran their miles, their hundreds and their
quarters, .
Propelled their javelins and hurled their
weights,
Heartened no doubt by clamorous exhorters,
Those tough antagonists from Hellene States.
Lastly, they got along without reporters
And none collected money at the gates,
Which, when those old Olympics you recall,
May well appear the strangest thing of all.

“Kerin Paul”: Captain Detmers, of
the Kormoran (B. 14/7/’4B), spent most
of his p.-0.-w. term at Dhurringile, near
Tatura (Vic.), where 200 German officers
were quartered in the old mansion built
by Winter Irving. Here he gained further
fame as the ringleader of the largest-
scale escape from any Victorian p.-0.-w.
or internee camp. The prisoners dug a
tunnel, 150 yards long, from beneath the
music-room of the mansion, extending 75
yards outside the barbed-wire. The exca-
vated earth was scattered about the
garden, and extreme stealth and patience
were exercised in months of digging. ' On
the night of January 10, 1945, 17 officers
and three batmen crawled through the
tunnel and scattered in small groups. All
were recaptured within a fortnight,
Detmers and Lieut.-Col. Bertram, of the
Luftwaffe, the two senior officers, were
picked up, weary, hungry and dishevelled,
at Tallygaroopna, only 20 miles from
the camp. As they re-entered the com-
pound a guard shouted impulsively,
“Shoot the pair of blankards! ” He was
severely reprimanded for this breach of
international law, which requires respect
for officer-prisoners.

“Horseless Horseman”; Theatrical
managers of other days understood

“Jasby”; A Queensland parson has
been telling his flock a few home-truths.
He said that neither atheists nor drunk-
ards were kee'ping young people away
from church, but “some of the pillars of
the House of God, who are often very
unattractive persons, though sincerely
“We only Want nine more. Mum, to make up a
cricket team.”
religious.” He referred to people who
were “gloomy, chilly and unsympathetic”
towards the pleasures of young people
and had forgotten they were once young
themselves. He spoke truly, and if there
were more sermons on those lines there
would be bigger congregations to listen
to them. Of course, the gloom-lovers
would probably form breakaway sects,
but no-one would be any the worse oft'
for that. Meanwhile in Maoriland other
parsons were protesting against the read-
ing of “risque telegrams” at wedding-
breakfasts and suggesting that the postal
department should do something about it.
Broad humor at wedding festivities did
not originate with the invention of the
telegraph. It has been tolerated at mar-
riage feasts in all ages and in aft coun-
tries, without the morals of the com-
munity suffering any marked decline. If
the parsons want to eliminate it they will
first have to abolish the institution of
marriage.

“Strict Veg.”: Undergraduate humor
isn’t as a rule particularly bright, but an
example from the University of Mel-
bourne is worth recording. Subject was
the contest for the title of “Miss Uni-
versity” for world student-relief funds,
the winner being entitled to a trip to
Sydney and participation in the final
Australian judging. The photos of vari-
ous favorites appeared in all their be-
wildering beauty on the student notice-
board, but no pictorial representation
appeared of “Miss Terry,” and nobody
seemed to know her, though the list of
contributions from her admirers kept on
growing. She was photographically dis-
played the other morning in the nude in
all the beauty of large, appealing eyes
and with a serious expression. She is

“M. 8”: That Welsh village that begins
with Llanfair and ends with och, using
58 letters in the process of making itself
the longest place-name in the world, was
nearly toppled last month when the N.Z.
Geographic Board renamed a hill Tau-
xnatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateapo-
kaiwhenuakitanatahu, one letter short of
the Welsh mouthful. What the N.Z. hill
did to deserve this isn’t clear; what I’m
wondering about is the feelings of the
signwriter who is certain to be ordered
to paint signs showing tourists where it is.

“Pitt St.”: When a man was discovered
near Sydney’s Circular Quay the other
day peering with close interest down a
street grating, one or two passers-by
paused. When he changed position, try-
ing to shade his eyes and look more
closely, they joined him. Before long that
grating and what lay beneath was being
closely scrutinised by several pairs of
eyes, what time the first man looked
anxiously about and inquired if anybody
had a torch. Nobody had, it appeared,
and those on the outskirts of the small
crowd saw matches and cigarette-lighters
used as illuminants, presumably in vain,
since the cause of it all kept asking for
a torch. Then a lorry-driver fished in
his tool-box and produced a flashlight,
whereupon the anxious one took it, shone
it briefly into the grating, handed it back
to its owner, and, disappointedly remark-
ing, “I thought I saw a’ gremlin,” rushed
into a passing tram and was carried away.
Then that crowd went thoughtfully on
its various ways.

Reflections of a Sydneysider;
You can have King’s Cross; give me the
Rocks as a spot to live in and spend one’s
leisure hours. As the pigeons fly the heart of
the Rooks where
Argyle - street empties
into Lower Fort-street —
is much nearer to the
G.P.O. than the Cross
mid much easier to
reach from the city
proper. With its large
floating population of
seamen the place is no
less cosmopolitan than
the Cross, and there is
a homeliness about the
residents —many of their
grandparents and great-
grandparents were born
in the district —nor is
there any of the arti-
ficial, so-called gaiety of
the other place. Most
of the Rocks’ menfolk
are hard workers and
their wives are fine
housekeepers who cook
good, honest tucker for
:heir families and sel-
dom resort to the tin-
opener. Nowhere in
Sydney are the front
windows and doorsteps
as polished and gleam-
ing as they are in
Gloucester - street, to
mention but one of the
local thoroughfares. The
children are a happy lot
of healthy - looking
youngsters, and in beau-
tiful Observatory Park
they have a spacious
playground commanding
views of the Harbor.
Living is much cheaper
around the Rocks than
up at the Cross, and rents are lower. The
tradespeople are an obliging crowd and do not
go in for petty rackets. The pubs—and the
Rocks has its share of them —are friendly places
with a club-like atmosphere, and everybody
appears to know everybody else. In the old
days the Rocks was one of the toughest places
in Sydney. It was the haunt of a “push” whose
idol was “Griffo,” who sold Bulletins as a
boy and was hailed in America by judges of
competence (among them Jim Corbett) as the
cleverest boxer of all time. Nowadays it is as
sedate as any North Shore suburb. You see a
few fights now and then, but the troublemakers
are usually outsiders. There’s not a police
station in the district, but there’s a number of
fine, old churches which never lack for wor-
shippers.

“Dong”: For an exhibition of complete
moral breakdown, watch the bloke who,
having dined at a cafe, finds that he has
left the mpney in his other suit. He
has sefen it often in the movies; people in
the same plight are hurled into the
restaurant kitchen tp work off their bill
on an Everest of dirty dishes. After he
has told his story to the waiter the
manager is called over. He listens, gazes
“I still think We Were lucky to get this flat, dear —even if I AM no good
at housework
at the guest’s honfest, tortured dial and
tells him to call in later to settle up;
“Just leave some little security.” A
friend of mine suffered this experience,
and, as well as gaining a better memory
thereafter, he came out financially ahead
on the deal. As security he left th»
manager a wrist-watch —a cheap affair
which did not work and was worn only
for ornament. However, when he turned
up with the cash the manager apologised
profusely and said that he had lost the
watch. That “timepiece” immediately
assumed the status of a family heirloom,
valuable and irreplaceable. My friend
still eats there “on the house.”

“Tick”: For some reason our baker
steadfastly refuses a monthly account and
stipulates a weekly cash settlement. One
settling-day Mum’s purse simply could
not be found, so she asked the carter to
call next day. The following week the
carter disclaimed all knowledge of the
late payment, remembering only that
Mum couldn’t find her purse when he
made his regular call. Under a “no pay,
no bread” threat she paid again, but de-
termined it would never happen a second
time. Next settling-day she smiled sweetly
at the baker as she asked in honeyed tone
“How much this week?” He seemed
relieved that there were no hard feelings,
but his grin was cut short when Mum
produced a household budget book and
asked him to sign on the dotted line
opposite the amount paid. The success
of the scheme has gone to Mum’s head,
and she’s thinking of tackling the butcher
and greengrocer on the same lines.

“Pongo”: That German p.-0.-w. (B.
14/7/’4B) who spent all his time in the
Church Army Hut had nothing on a
carpenter at Cockatoo Dock, This artful
dodger was never known to do a tap of
toil. Equipped with a handsaw and a
pine plank about 12ft. long, he moved
from hideout to hideout. If a boss
hove in sight the wood-butcher placed
his plank into position and carefully
sawed half-an-inch off it. When the boss
moved away so did the carpenter —but
in the opposite direction.

“Zake”: Since Hollywood received con-
vincing proof through the box office that
a film with good music can pay—it started
with “A Song to Remember,” a flood of
Chopin melodies played by Jose Iturbi,
which ran at Sydney State for three months
—the alleged life stories of famous com-
posers are becoming a craze. Chopin’s
affair with the novelist George Sand at
Majorca was one of the highlights, though
some of the less romantic aspects of the
composer’s attachment to the lady who
was six years his senior were conveniently
forgotten. As Hollywood regards the
love-lives of the composers it portrays
as paramount, it will be interesting to see
how it will tackle Liszt. There are quite
a few ladies to choose from, from the
Comtesse d’Agoult, who bore Franz three
children, one of whom became Wagner’s
second wife, to the Princess Caroline
Sayn-Wittgenstein, who was still un-
divorced when she ran off with the dash-
ing composer. Even after turning to
religion, being made a secular priest and
approaching 60 Liszt found it impossible
to resist the charms of 19-year-old Olga
Janina. It was James Gibbons Huneker
who made the unkind crack that “when
Liszt was not kneeling before a crucifix
he was kneeling before a woman.”
No doubt Hollywood will eventually
glamorise him as a beautiful high-minded
young man who renounces women and
the world.

“Hamer”: I am a sound sleeper, but
the cessation of the ticking of a clock in
the next room (not consciously heard in
wakeful moments) is sufficient to wake
me. The stopping of a sound to which
the senses have become used is, it seems,
/
more disturbing than any new noise. My
most vivid experience occurred in a New
Zealand mining town where I had been
for three days—long enough for the
eternal thumping of the batteries, ac-
centuated by the confined space in the
gorge in which the mining town stands on
a sort of shelf, to become one of the nor-
mal things of life, I went to bed at about
11.30 on Saturday; shortly I awoke with
a feeling that the world had come to an
end. As I leapt out of bed to meet what-
ever was coming a cold sweat was on
me and my hair was prickling. It took
me some time to realise that it Was only
the stoppage of the batteries at midnight
that had disturbed me. The silence was
devastating, and I took some time to get
used to it and go to sleep again.

“Melbn”: The couple, now dead, who
presented Victoria with unnumbered
concrete horse-troughs, have earned the
silent gratitude of thousands of neddies.
L G. Irish, a wood merchant of Windsor,
a different sort of Quixote, has had in-
and-out results in his campaign to dis-
tribute 10,000 Bibles, Gospels and Testa-
ments to the staffs of breweries, wine-
makers, hotels and bookies. Some
Bungs were most receptive, but others
were regrettably resistant. Bookies at
Moonee Valley were so impressed that
they asked him to preach the Gospel to
them —“they listened most reverently.”
Brewers offered donations for the pur-
chase of fresh Bibles. Mr. Irish proposes
to extend his mission to dance-halls and
swing orchestras shortly. It isn’t recorded
that any brewers, Bungs or bookies, after
reading his Holy Book, have given up
their avocations.

“Kanguhrec”: Young Charlie had been
going about with his girl for seven years
before they finally decided to get hitched.
On the appointed day friends and rela-
tives, suitably bedecked and in appropri-
ate mood, assembled at the little country
church which was in the parish of a
minister who lived some 10 miles away.
Charlie turned up looking uncomfortable
and clean in his new suit. Twenty
minutes later the bride arrived. Another
half-hour passed before Charlie plucked
up enough courage to announce that he
had forgotten to tell the parson anything
about the wedding.

“Deucer”: Stronghold towed the Ven-
detta from Singapore to Java (B.
21 /7/’4B), but the Chinese river-boat Ping
Wo took on the tow from there. Ping
Wo had managed to get away from the
China coast one jump ahead of the Japs.
She arrived at Singapore and was used as
a patrol-boat outside the harbor until
things got too hot; then, as the city was
falling, she set out for Java with a crowd
of refugees aboard. Vendetta was lying
in a port in Java, and the captain of the
Ping Wo had orders to tow her to Aus-
tralia. It was a tough assignment for
the old river-boat, but through the fine
seamanship of her captain, nearly a
month after leaving Java, she steamed
into Fremantle with the Vendetta astern.
I was on her. We had a hell of a trip,
but what a glorious binge when we hit
Fremantle!
WHAT NEXT?
“A workman at the U.S. atomic-energy plant is
quoted as saying: ‘l’d just as soon we hadn’t busted
that atom—now it looks like we got a tiger by the
tail-’ ”
A bit of worth-while wisdom, a conviction
No trace of ambiguity engirds,
Imparted in the homeliest of diction
And with the barest minimum of words;
And even in more academic centres
One may suspect the same dim doubts assail
The minds of those illustrious inventors
Who find they’ve “got a tiger by the tail.”
Will they be handed down to future ages*
As benefactors, and their names be writ
On honor rolls, these scientific sages
Who showed us how the atom could be split,
Ranked among those who’ve made mankind
their debtor
For their discoveries, or the reverse.
Acclaimed as men who left the world a better
One than they found it —or a vastly worse?
Who knows? Will horror-stricken contemplation
Of what may wait upon atomic war
Picture such hell the most aggressive nation
Will shrink from ever risking any more?
Or when all avenues of shilly-shally
Dictators and diplomatists exhaust,
Is poor old earth doomed to throw in her alley,
Whelmed in. a universal holocaust?
Still, there are optimists who in the farness
Of time predict, and wait to hail with whoops,
A tiger tamed and trained to trot in harness
Or schooled for leaping through industrial
hoops. *
Again, who knows? And while we mildly
wonder
What next may reach us from behind the veil
Where tiny particles are rent asunder,
The same grim fix they seem to labor under,
The chaps who’ve “got a tiger by the tail.”

LITTLE FRENCH CLOCKS
Tiny things . . . we measured them and the largest
was only four inches across! They arrived recently
from France and live up to the high standard of precision
workmanship that made pre-war French clocks famous. All are
30-hour clocks, all chrome-finished; some have luminous dials,
some luminous figures, and all have alarms. The little Travel Clock
at the right folds into a leather
ease no larger than a compact.

The demand outlook for cement is one
of steady pressure for some time ahead
—owing to the lag in home-building,
the heavy consumers of the stuff (large-
scale public works, factory, office and flat
building) haven’t yet got into their stride.
Production, now above pre-war level, is
still below plant capacity, owing to the
coal and labor bottlenecks. But the
value of production per person engaged
in the industry has declined, while wages,
etc., gobble a greater proportion of gross
takings, as the following table, compiled
from figures published by the Common-
wealth statistician, shows;

* Portland cement and cement goods.
Although the figures in the last two
columns include cement goods as well as
Portland cement, they indicate the over-
all trend, which has been aggravated by
introduction of the 40-hour week and
recurrent wage-lifts. Because the gain
from expanding production was unable to
keep pace with the advance in costs, ss.
a ton was added to the controlled selling-
price of cement last year, making the
rise 12s. 6d. since war began.
Kandos (paid capital £673,862) and
Australian Cement (paid capital £760,433)
are two holding cos. Each owns half of
the £2,000,000 of paid capital in Aus-
tralian Portland Cement Pty., whose two
plants have a combined capacity of
475.000 tons p.a.—Kandos (N.S.W.)
200.000 tons and Fyansford (Vic.) 275,000
tons. Capacity at Fyansford is to be
lifted by another 60,000 tons p.a., and
orders have been placed locally for the
equipment. Also, the Kandos plant is
being further modernised. Shareholders
in the holding cos. will not be asked to
assist.
Apart from its holding in the operating
co., over whose figures the curtain is
kept drawn, Kandos’s only other visible
assets at June 30 were Government
securities and cash £241,948 and shares
in Pipe Linings (Aus.) Pty. £lOOO. The
holding in a profit-earnings subsidiary,
which doesn’t appear to contribute much
to the pool, has been written out of the
books.
The operating co. has paid 6 p.c. for
each of the last half-dozen years as
against 9 p.c. before that. Kandos, which
paid a run of p.c. divs. to 1942,
dropped the rate to 7.8 p.c. for the next
three years, then lifted it to 10 p.c. for
the three to close of last accounts. Since
there is believed to be a comfortable
margin between the operating co.’s earn-
ings and distribution, the 10 p.c. isn’t so
precarious as Kandos’s own figures might
suggest.
As for the future, much depends upon
what happens in connection with costs,
still on a steep up-grade, and selling
prices, which are controlled. Plant is up-
to-date and efficient, and is well able to
look after any competition that may de-
velop from the recently-floated Metro-
politan Portland Cement, Ltd., an
£BOO,OOO concern which is to put up a
150,000-ton-p.a. plant near Liverpool
(N.S.W.). Kandos has its own coalmine
and lime deposits, both near the works.
The next table reflects the market’s

During the between-wars period keen
competition, which means price-cutting,
and difficulties associated with plant and
costs kept earnings and distributions to
shareholders in this old-established
biscuit, cake and plum-pudding business
at moderate levels. Then war eliminated
competition and sent turnover up with a
rush. Earnings responded, and the board
made the most of its opportunities—
allowances for depreciation, etc., were in-
creased and more of the declared profit
was put by than was distributed.
Over the last nine years the ords. have
had an average of 5.8 p.c,, £195,178 has
been visibly added to reserves, £271,928
has been allowed for depreciation, the
book-value of fixed assets has been re-
duced by £155,508 net, and cash, etc.,
has been strengthened by £382,538 net:

When the books last closed, stocks (up
£21,874) and debtors’ balances (up £1458)
together more than covered outside lia-
bilities, including the tax reserve. And
Government securities and cash exceeded
paid capital by £86,163. The co. is thus
financially ready to modernise plant,
equipment and premises. The work has
been planned, and authority received to
go ahead with it; completion, delayed by
shortages, should enhance competitive
power by reducing production and dis-
tribution costs. Last term £47,670 more
was spent on plant than was written off.
Last term plant was prevented from
doing all it might by material and labor
shortages and interruption of fuel and
power supplies. However, a lift in selling
prices (approved by the control authori-
ties) cushioned the bump from rising wage
and other costs. Abolition of War-time
(Co.) Tax helped, too —£11,487 provided
but not needed for the purpose in 1947
was written back to p. and 1. and has been
added to the 1947 profit in the table.
Gross earnings (£323,118) stepped up
£14,987. Exes. (£257,207) took all but
£247 of the gain, leaving the net result
(£65,910, best yet) at 21.9 p.c. on capital
as against 21.8, 17.8, 13.3, 16.4, 14.1 and
8.1 p.c. back to 1942. The all-round
8 p.c. div. was repeated, and there is
nothing at the moment to suggest that it
is likely to be interfered with. Capital in-
cludes 100,000 £1 6 p.c. cum. prefs.,
which advance with the ords. in any dis-
tribution beyond that rate.
Of the two small subsidiaries, the ice-
cream co. again paid an unstated div.
from increased earnings, but the dehy-
dration co. made a loss (£1128). Since
the close of accounts fresh wage and price
increases have given costs another lift.
What will happen in connection with
price-control depends upon legislation
yet to be passed by the Victorian Parlia-
ment.
The market notes the co.’s strong points
and prices the ords. at 41s. and prefs. at
40s. 6d. The return at these figures is
approx. 3.9 p.c. in each case on an 8 p.c.
div. basis. Net tangible cover is
£5 17s. 9d. prefs. and 325. 7d. ords.

The strong market enjoyed by the
building and ancillary trades since war
ended seems likely to continue for some
time, with costs as the chief limiting
factor so far as net earnings are con-
cerned. To cope with the swelling de-
mand for the builders’ and plumbers’
hardware, dairy utensils, kitchen equip-
ment, etc., which the co. turns out, it
recently put up a new factory and offices
at Auburn and expanded the capacity of
the main works at Alexandria, another
Sydney suburb. To help meet the cost
100,000 new £1 shares were issued at par
early in the 1947 term; and no time was
lost in finding profitable employment for
the money, and more besides.
Last term increased turnover —thanks
to the slowly-gathering momentum in the
building trade —more than offset the
effects of the 40-hour week and wage
lifts, etc. Helpful, too, was abolition of
the War-time (Co.) Tax —£9433 provided
for the purpose in the previous term was
passed to free reserves in the last
accounts. Leaving this out of the reckon-
ing, latest net earnings were £13,871
stronger at £50,626, best yet. That was
after allowing £9182 (up £941) for de-
preciation and whatever was considered
necessary for taxation. The £50,626 was
15.3 p.c. on capital (pref. and ord. com-
bined) as against 12.6 p.c. and 14.5 p.c.
for the two preceding years and an aver-
age of 9.8 p.c. for the six years before
that. The ords. got 10 p.c. again, and the
prefs. (30,000 9 per cents., subject to
the outmoded N.S.W. Interest Reduction
Act) got their full contract rate for the
second time since 1929.
The new factory, opening of an addi-
tional retail branch at Hornsby (N.S.W.)
and the bigger trading added £37,208
net to freeholds, £20,592 to plant, £50,726
to stocks and £10,042 to book debts:

To meet the outlay cash, etc., was drawn
upon for £36,105 and £42,602 net was
added to the outside debt —£39,075 was
clipped off the amount coming to sundry
creditors, etc., and the co. went to its
bankers for £81,677. The contraction in
the more-or-less liquid surplus (£189,540)
was only £29,957, despite the addition of
£57,800 to fixed assets.
Since the close of accounts the costs
curve has steepened, but the co. has no
difficulty in disposing of output. The
market sums up the position by pricing
the pound ords. at 455. 6d., at which
figure the return is 4.4 p.c. on a 10 p.c.
div. basis. The prefs. at 41s. give a
similar return on a 9 p.c. distribution.
Net tangible cover is £l4 12s. lid. prefs.
and 265. 4d. ords. The prefs. are entitled
to a premium of 2s. 6d. a share in the
event of a wind-up or return of capital.

Though factory area and plant have been
greatly increased since 1939, Kelvinator is
unable to keep abreast of the order-book.
One of the aftermaths of the war
has been an unparalleled demand for
refrigerators ; but it’s hard to estimate
what regular demand will be after this
impetus has worked off. Many new-
comers have entered the field of manu-
facture, and the edge is being taken off
the market by some of the less expensive
brands now being turned out at great
speed. Still, the shortage of raw materials
might be an insurance against over-
production for a while. Higher prices
for food and the week-end closing
of shops will tend to put a premium on
refrigeration, which has its due place in
the various building programmes still to
be completed.
Whilst strengthening its sales branches
in preparation for an era of “normal
selling conditions,” Kelvinator is more
immediately occupied with questions of
supply. The co. does its casting and
engineering work for sealed-unit re-
frigerators at the Keswick (Adelaide) head-
quarters, where new plant has lately been
installed. Cabinets are made and fitted
at Finsbury, where a subsidiaty also
makes the absorption type of refrigerator
and steel-pressing and porcelain enamel-
ling units have just been set up. Addi-
tional factories and assembly depots are
at Alexandria (Sydney) and Fishermen’s
Bend (Melbourne). Kelvinator also has an
established business in Wayne petrol-
pumps, made under U.S. licence, and has
taken to manufacturing domestic wash-
ing-machines.
All plants would be capable of in-
creased output if steel and other materials
were plentiful enough. To ensure con-
tinuous production at present levels,
the board has had to build up

Plant is shown at £152,831 after deprecia-

of the conservative valuation, the board
didn’t think it necessary when declaring
the latest profit “to write off the special
additional 20 p.c. depreciation allowed
for tax purposes on the cost of new plant.
This has, however, been taken into
account in calculating the provision for
taxation on the year’s profits.” The latest
tax was also abnormally low because the
board used an amount (unstated) which
had been provided unnecessarily for 1947
War-time (Co.) Tax to help pay its 1948
commitment. The net provision for 1948
tax was £19,665 from a consolidated
profit shown at £72,340.

Taxes and Vote-buying
Mr. Chifley, with a Budget in
prospect and his party in the
process of being assessed at its
real worth by the electorate —the
estimate declines daily—has
forecast a reduction in taxes and
an increase in the scope and rate
(up ss. a week) of old-age and
other pensions, with a lift of
2s. 6d. a week in child-endow-
ment (making the rate 10s. a
week after the first child) during
the current financial year.
The real measure of his taxa-
tion concessions is yet to be
gauged. They are bound to
have party-political motives be-
hind them. Mr. Chifley, the
alleged economist, is the most
calculating politician ever to
lead the Federal “Labor” party.
His “economics” are of the
variety that bend readily to the
calls of the Socialist programme
and to the party call for retain-
ing office at any cost —to the
community.
When he thought his stocks
were a little higher Mr.
Chifley refused tq consider
tax reductions, and he sneered
at the proposals for tax-cuts
made by the Opposition. Now
that his stocks are down, and
still falling, he has been forced
into a political compromise. But
there is no economic planning
behind his latest Budget move ;
he is simply attempting to buy
back political popularity with
taxpayers’ own money. That
applies both to tax “concessions”
and pension “liberalisation.”
In income tax alone Mr.
Chifley’s Government in 1947-48
collected 16 times as much as
in the last pre-war year. That
was after handing the State
Governments £45 million as tax-
refunds. Taking Commonwealth
taxation of all kinds, the 1947-48
haul by “Labor” was five times
as great as the 1938-39 collection.
Mr. Chifley last year collected
£3BB million in taxes, after
allowing for rebates to the
States. In 1938-39 the figure
was £77 million. Yet the in-
terest bill on the 1939-45 war
debt—the excuse mostly used to
justify the increase in post-war
taxation —has been only £48.2
million. What is Mr. Chifley
doing with the rest of the £3ll
million extra taxes levied nowa-
days?
There has been a vast increase
in the cost of “social security.”
Also, though our “defence”
measures today are feeble and
largely politically based, the
outgo under the heading of “de-
fence” ran into £132 million, ex-
clusive of interest charges, last
year. All sorts of political and
socialistic adventutes are being
paid for in the name of “de-
fence” —also losses on socialised
undertakings, such as “shipping
control,” as well as subsidies
paid to offset the inflation that
has become rampant in the
country as a result of “Labor”
finance and Communist-
“ Labor” industrial lawlessness.
Departmental costs have in-
flated prodigiously also. The
Federal civil service now ex-
ceeds 166,000 persons, as against
60,000 before the war, ,Not all
the salaries are charged to de-
partments, as such —some are
debited under more general
headings. But “administration”
cost £26.8 million last year,
compared with £15.5 million in
1946-47 and £4 million in 1938-
39. And “business” income, in
spite of the heavy charges for
postages and other services, was
£lO million short of expenditure
last year, though it looked as
though the Socialists tucked
away several millions in the ex-
pense allocations for the pur-
pose of extending the socialised
“business” services.
Mr. Chifley has protested for
a long time that high tax rates
are necessary to offset infla-
tionary forces. Mr. Truman, in-
deed, has taken a similar stand,
though taxation in the United
States has never been as high as
it is in the Commonwealth. But
the economic and industrial
background in the United States
is vastly different from that in
Australia, The U.S.A. is a free-
enterprise country, with a much-
increased post-war industrial
output. It has introduced the
Taft-Hartley labor law to deal
with Communists and lawless
strikes. And it has used Budget
surpluses to reduce the national
debt, whereas any increased
revenue is a signal to Mr.
Chifley to increase the civil-ser-
vice payroll, add to depart-
mental activities, or venture into
socialistic extravagances compet-
ing with private enterprise.
Mr. Chifley’s wrong use of
revenue drawn from the spend-
ing-power of industry and the
people has defeated any anti-
inflationary effect it might be
expected to have. It has, in-
stead, an inflationary effect; it
increases the payments going
out to people who provide no
production in return. The grow-
ing army of civil servants, of
pensioners and recipients of
“endowments” and the like is
doing nothing, on balance, to in-
crease the quantity of produc-
tion available for use by the
people. Mr. Chifley’s economic
programme, in short, drains in-
dustry of essential labor and
adds to the spending-power of
non-producers, thus creating an
extremely inflationary position.
On the industrial front, in
addition to the Budget-cwm-
civil-service disability, there is
the wanton and unchecked
strangling of all industrial effort
by the Communist-controlled
unions. Mr. Chifley has been
extremely sympathetic towards
Communist “philosophers.” His
socialist programme at Canberra
has been of the greatest assist-
ance to their treacherous sabo-
tage, and he has done not a
thing to enforce the laws of the
land against them. He obvi-
ously does not for a moment
contemplate legislation of the
kind embodied in the United
States’ Taft-Hartley Act.
The industrial and financial
programmes of Mr. Chifley and
his Socialists have dovetailed
with the industrial wrecking of
the Communists in a way that
forces greater inflation on the
country every day. If there was
ever any sincerity in Mr.
Chifley’s professed belief that
high taxation would curb infla-
tion it has obviously failed
through the way he has used the
taxes and through the Com-
munist efforts to choke produc-
tion at all costs. The inflationary
condition has grown worse with
Mr. Chifley’s increased control
of the people’s money.
The increase in the so-called
“national income” of £306 mil-
lion (to £1571 million) last year
—24 p.c.—helped Mr, Chifley to
gather in a record rake-off of
taxes, but it does not truly re-
flect the country’s productive
position. It i§ as much a mea-
sure of inflation as anything else.
Though he is losing the re-
sponsibility of controlling prices
—the recent referendum did that
—Mr. Chifley has so far not
condescended to tell the public
whether he is going to continue
price-subsidies, for which pur-
pose he extracted £45.8 million
from taxpayers’ pockets last
year. If he does not continue
subsidies and doesn’t give tax-
payers corresponding relief it
becomes obvious that Mr.
Chifley has ceased to care a
dump about inflation. Typical
of his unconcern has been the
sales tax still levied on many
building materials regardless of
his overbuoyant revenue on the
one hand and the soaring cost
of housing on the other.
The purely political character
of any tax “concessions” granted
by the Chifley Administration in
the past is evidenced by the fact
that companies have been
granted no tax-relief except the
elimination of War-time (Com-
pany) Tax, which returned only
a small revenue to Canberra.
The steepest war-time rates re-
main in all other cases. In-
dustry thus has to contend with
Communist sabotage in produc-
tion —coal, power and transport
stoppages, as well as strife in
individual industries—and over-
taxation on the financial side.
The Trade Balance
The value of Australian ex-
ports for the year to June 30
reached the record figure of
£4ll million, an increase of
£lO2 million over the record
established the year before, and
nearly three and a half times as
much the value of our merchan-
dise exports for the last pre-war
year.
The quantities of exports for
the past year are not available ;
but, except in the case of wheat,
it is doubtful whether any were
up much on the figures for the
previous year, and a number,
including wool, were down. It
was soaring prices that caused
such an inflation in the cheque
we received for our exports.
Wool prices were much higher
for the year, and wheat also
sold at a record figure. Metals
and rabbitskins were also up,
and dairy produce fetched a
higher price. Wool exports
brought in £l5O million last
year, and wheat and flour £B5
million.
This higher-price feature of
our trading was not, of course,
a one-way affair. The cost of
imports also soared —aggregating
£340 million, they were £l3O
million higher than in 1946-47.
The balance of trade in Aus-
tralia’s favor was £7l million,
of which £6B million was in
respect of merchandise. The
favorable commodity balance
for the preceding year was
£100.5 million.
In respect of imports also it is
difficult to estimate quantities.
But again it becomes a matter
for consideration as to whether
we received as much, in
the way of goods, for the
extra money as we got in
1946-47. Certain it is, from the
figures just presented, that, on
balance, we were around £3O
million down in our final sur-
plus for the year compared with
the record balance for the pre-
ceding 12 months.
Australian trade with the
United States and Canada
showed an adverse balance of
£42 million, or £9 million worse
than in the previous period-
all this in spite of dollar sav-
ings. The fact that our trade
with the dollar area shows such
a large deficit indicates that our
total favorable balance with
other countries is bigger than
£7l million.
Inflated receipts for exports
have been one of the factors in
the big increase in the com-
puted “national income” of the
Commonwealth —estimated offi-
cially at £1571 million for
1947-48, and up £306 million on
the previous year’s estimate.
Other factors have' been higher
wages and the 40-hour week ; in
other words, the volume of our
“national” income is based on
costs as well as income.
All these figures—-exports,
imports, prices and “national in-
come” —need to be closely sur-
veyed before arriving at any
estimate of the real prosperity
of this country. Until we have
a great deal more production
per man per hour, and a lot
more men transferred from the
Government payroll to produc-
tive work, there can be no feel-
ing of real economic security in
this country.

tan Portland Cement, Ltd. (B.

LONDON AIRMAIL
From Herbert Holman
National Health Service
It is early yet to assess fully
the effect on the national life
of the new Health Service, which
came into force on July 5. The
first, and most noticeable,, re-
action is the strained patience of
many general practitioners, who,
already hard-pressed, have had
to cope with the double burden
of new registrations and greatly
increased attendances at the
morning and afternoon surgery.
From inquiries made at several
post-offices, all of which had
run out of registration-forms,
the public have responded well;
but not without slight mis-
giving, for it is felt generally
that the doctor-patient relation-
ship must lose some of the old
personal touch.
With the passing of only a few
weeks it is becoming plain to
both employer and employee
that the scheme costs money—
and equally plain who has to
pay for it. The combined
weekly contribution of 9s. Id.
(4s. 2d. and 4s. lid. respectively)
markedly affects both payroll
and pay-envelope.
Perhaps to forestall any accu-
sation of unfairness, the Prime
Minister thought fit to tell the
nation, in a broadcast, that
“many besides Socialists” had
contributed to the service. He
may also have sought to put the
kill to the possible legend that
the Act came into being only
after a lone crusade by knight-
errant Aneurin Bevan against
the twin evils of “traditional
ways of thought and financial
vested interests.”
Some of the reforms (in par-
ticular, the hospital service) have
been the concern-of the medical
profession for many years.
Commonsense suggests that a
long-term policy, closely and
harmoniously integrated with
the needs of the doctors, was
called for: so that the old ways
could be gradually fused into
the new with a minimum of
dislocation. But politicians, un-
fortunately, tend to think in five-
year periods, between one
general election and the next,
seeking quick results.
Meanwhile there is an urgent
need for Health Centres, upon
which the success of the scheme
depends; and the shortage of
nurses may easily be more
serious than the shortage of
money.
Statesman or Spouter?
Much criticism has recently
been directed at the Minister of
Health for his apparently irre-
sponsible remarks. It has been
pointed out that while any indi-
vidual may hold his own opinion
and, if he chooses, express it,
the cheap abuse of the tub-
thumper is a sad incongruity if
it flows from the lips of a
Cabinet Minister. True enough.
But what has not been demon-
strated to the disgusted British
public is that Mr. Bevan’s
periodic outbursts are by no
means unpremeditated. They are
as necessary to the continuance
of his peculiar kind of political
power as fuel is to a furnace.
People are apt to greet his
utterances with the same wry
smile as they did those made by
the late Minister of Fuel —the
“tinker’s-cuss” speech, for in-
stance, and the soft words of
complacency that failed to com-
fort the nation during the dis-
astrous fuel crisis of 1947. It
was then plain that the country
could not tolerate Mr. Shinwell
much longer and that he would
have to go. A pretty problem
for the Prime Minister to solve!
As chairman of the Socialist
party and still popular among
the faithful, Mr. Shinwell could
hardly be expected to quit office
altogether. So, as a captain at
cricket “buries” a poor fielder,
he was moved to the compara-
tively innocuous Ministry of
War.
It is worth noting that Mr.
Bevan has now been Minister of
Health for three years —the en-
tire life of the present Govern-
ment —and it is confidently sug-
gested here that no other man
who had behaved —or mis-
behaved —in the same way could
possibly have survived. Over
housing he at once took up the
now familiar attitude of trucu-
lence and antagonism towards
the building trades. Later he
faced the medical profession
with the same unconstitutional
defiance. When the profession
disagreed with him it was “sabo-
tage of an Act of Parliament.”
Only in the last rounds of the
fight did he agree to remove the
doctors’ fears by promising an
amending bill which would make
it impossible to introduce a
whole-time salaried State medi-
cal service by regulation.
What followed was a series of
uncomfortable delays over the
expected Ministerial changes.
While some politicians of lesser
stature disappeared from the
active political scene, Mr. Bevan,
it seemed, was not inclined to
budge. Then, speaking at a
banquet, he said that he hoped
he would be spared to see the
new Act through to completion.
Thus he laid bare his tenacity,
and the speech was taken as
being a challenge to the Prime
Minister.
To the bewildered public it
suggested that the head of the
Government might not be able
to control his subordinates. At
any rate, Mr. Bevan stayed in
office.
“Verminous People”
“No man can get above his
pursuit in life: it is getting above
himself, which is impossible.”
These words of Hazlitt explain
much of the make-up of Aneurin-
Bevan, whose pursuit has been
to go his own way and whose
predilection has been to live up
to character. Speaking recently
in Monmouthshire, he said: “I
never used to regard myself so
much as a politician as a pro-
jectile discharged from the Welsh
valleys. No matter what harsh
words may come from the
mouths of the great, kind words
lie in the mouths of the weak.”
The audience was a Welsh one.
At Whitsuntide, on the eve of
the Labor Conference, he
attacked the British press, which,
he said, was “the most prosti-
tuted press in the world, most
of it owned by millionaires.”
The audience, most significantly,
was comprised of diehards of the
Labor movement. Three days
later he topped the Ministerial
poll in the elections to the Labor
national executive committee.
In another outburst of bitter
scorn he remarked that the
Tories were “worse than ver-
min” and that he had a lifelong
“burning hatred” of them. This
was at Manchester, in celebration
of the opening of the new
Health Service.
Nothing is to be gained by
defending the victims of Mr.
Bevan’s vituperation. It can
easily be shown that his penuri-
ous youth was not the direct re-
sult of Tory misrule; that “the
bovine and phlegmatic Anglo-
Saxons” have made a fair con-
tribution to stable government
and human progress; that the
state of the nation’s health in
1926 was not the result of Mr.
Churchill holding office as Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer. And
walking evidence can be pro-
duced that there are decent, as
well as vermin-free, people who
are Tories.
Even if Mr. Bevan does not
appreciate that his dubious faith
is based on fallacies, he would
hate to be told —still less to be
convinced —that his allegations
were untrue. He knows that he
can command 736,000 votes
from the Labor delegates, who
like him because of the things
he tells them. And he knows
that while he has this backing he
must remain a force in the poli-
tical field whether his party is
in office or not.
It is a sad fact that his per-
sistent imprecations, however
unworthy and narrow they may
be, are none the less calculated
and astute.

THE EMPIRE'S
FAVOURED CIGARETTE
7HD-7.48
SUNDRY SHOWS
Finey's Caricatures.
George Finey’s exhibition at
Sydney Education Department
Galleries is chiefly of carica-
tures of composers. There are
also paintings of wildflowers,
mushrooms and the like, good
of their kind, modestly labelled
“Wall Decorations”: one,
“Leaves,” has been bought by
the N.S.W. Gallery,
The caricatures are highly
colored and boldly drawn. Verdi
has sombre, startling and red-
shadowed eyes, Beethoven re-
sembles a red and tormented
bull, Bach is a red pear, Liszt
is an eagle with warts and
Stravinsky has a yellow nose.
Byelayev is, oddly, both birdlike
and simian, and the impression
of Chopin is rather raffishly
crude, like a pavement-artist’s
conception of fin de siecle de-
cadence. Other portraits are
polychromous and, if not strictly
zoological, sufficiently eccentric.
Sibelius, with a great green
dome of a head and an inhuman
green face, bears an uncanny re-
semblance to those monsters
from Mars and suchlike places
immortalised in the Sunday
newspaper comics.
And so on: one composer has
lips like unpleasantly ripe toma-
toes ; another looks like a soul-
ful pig; one’s face is yellow,
another’s crimson, and a third
has ears like jug-handles. Rossini
has uncomfortably puffed
cheeks, and Wieniawski appears
to have been surprised by
demons. In the collection there
is much that is startling to the
eye, and a strong flavor of the
risible. But it is unlikely that
Finey has simply set out to
shock and astound, and unthink-
able that he is seeking cheap
laughs at the expense of genius.
His aim is the respectable one
of comprehending in paint not
only character, but that essence
of character which lies in the
subject’s work. And, not sur-
prisingly, he has failed.
For it is, after all, a hopeless
ambition. In a metaphysical
sense it may be true that the
artist and his work —the com-
poser and his music—are one,
but reduced to the mediums
through which an artist must
work, the senses, the gulf is un-
bridgeable and sometimes ludi-
crously wide. A man with a hare-
lip may create beautiful music,
but one receives no proper ap-
preciation of his music by being
confronted with the affliction.
A great portrait-painter might
bridge the gulf, in a measure, by
painting character in lineaments
and giving a hint of the subject’s
work in the flawless projection
of character. But this is, at best,
a hint, and Finey has attempted
something else, the visualisation
of the work itself; by confus-
ing the lesser with the greater
he has fallen into the hopeless
mathematical position of trying
to confine the vast in the minute
and the trivial. And then, too,
Finey is not a great portrait-
painter but a caricaturist.
In most of his “impressions”
the hand of the caricaturist
shows too clearly: on top of the
confusion of conception there is
a muddle of influences. By a
stretch of the imagination
Finey’s music-influenced carica-
tures might be likened to
literary - influenced black-and-
white work such as Beardsley’s.
But there are other influences,
more journalistic than literary.
Some of Finey’s composers, in
another context, could be poli-
ticians and businessmen. Finey
the imaginative artist is very
much influenced by Finey the
cartoonist.
But Beardsley, at any rate,
knew what he was doing, and
did not attempt two things at
once. There is, of course, noth-
ing improper in painting impres-
sions of music. But in this case
a method, however bold, must
distinguish between the images
invoked and the, probably dull,
image of the creator: between
music and noses. And such an
art must rest firmly on its own
foundations. Beardsley, who
was famous in his time, was
dominated by a literary influ-
ence, and his illustrations, unique
as they were, smell of the study.
The black-and-white work of
Norman Lindsay, which has
literary content, has the taste of
the sun, The one was dominated
by literature, the other uses it
as a symbol.
But there is, after all, some-
thing bold and interesting in
Finny’s experiment. A man sur-
prised by demons is not a bad
symbol for a composer. Had
Finey carried it further and
painted his impressions, without
the composer, in whatever sym-
bols he is capable of handling
he might have achieved the
validity of art. There is brutal
force in the picture of Beeth-
oven with shocked red hair and
massive furrowed brow as a bull
tormented by genius, and the
picture of Schubert, whether it
is a true symbol of his music or
not, is a feasible image of calm
and sensual genius. On the other
hand, Stassov, the art- and music-
wjiter, is seen in a shako and
fur-collared coat, with a long
white beard and a big red nose.
There is a kind of bulbous
dignity in this picture. Here,
perhaps, Finey has been re-
strained from too-outrageous
flights of the imagination by the
comfortable realities of shako
and beard. For if there is some-
thing demoniacal about music it
is equally true that there is
something sane and reasonable
about red noses. And there is
something incurably comic
about the shorthand of carica-
ture.

Three floors high in the old
Bulletin building at 214
George-street the Studio of
Realist Art is holding an exhibi-
tion of drawings by Roderick
Shaw, Hal Missingham, Douglas
Campbell, Newton Hedstrom,
Herbert McClintock, Marjorie
Penglase, Nan Hortin, Roy Dal-
garno and Lionel Jago. The
most impressive object on view
is a work of Nature rather than
art, a large, genuine and very
dead skull of a bullock which
may have been imported as a
symbol but which, on the other
hand, may be all that is left of
somebody’s pet in the old days.
The works of art look like any-
body’s works of art —any rea-
sonably promising student’s—
but Newton Hedstrom’s “Wool-
lahra” differs from the usual
dingy collection of tenements in
that the drawing is flooded with
light, and Roy Dalgamo’s
“Handkerchief” differs from the
usual student-nude in that,
showing the model upside-
down, it has wit and a touch of
imagination.

There is a certain hard veri-
similitude about the still-life,
landscape and portraits of S.
Antonini at Kozminsky’s Gal-
lery, Melbourne. Antonini is a
painstaking painter, but his ob-
servation doesn’t seem to go be-
low the surface, except, perhaps,
in “Summer,” where some of
the softness of the landscape is
reflected in the painting.
Anne Ziegler and
Webster Booth.
The art of the love duet re-
ceived an unexampled fillip from
Anne Ziegler and Webster
Booth, the English singers who
made their Australian d€but at
the Sydney Town Hall last week.
Miss Ziegler’s voice is a lyric
soprano of excellent quality and
range, with an especially fine
mezza voce; Booth’s is a rich
and fairly robust tenor and
under perfect control when well
throttled back. Add crystal-
clear enunciation, ability to act
the number they are singing, and
the fact that they make a good-
looking pair, and the recipe for
the perfect duet is complete.
Their best offering, and one
which could stand repetition dur-
ing the season, was the big scene
from Act I of “La Boheme,”
Booth gave Rudolfo’s Narrative
with fine ardor and sincerity,
achieving a ringing and well-
sustained high C. Miss Ziegler
followed with the charming
“They Call Me Mimi,” beauti-
fully sung, and then followed
the duet “Lovely Maid in the
Moonlight.” Another excellent
concerted number was “Stay,
Frederick, Stay,” from “The
Pirates of Penzance.” It says
much for them that the duettists
could step from Puccini and
Sullivan to the lightest of num-
bers by Romberg, Friml,
Novell© and Stoltz. One of the
most successful duets was “The
&eys of Heaven,” of which they
made a delightful potted
comedy.
Clarence Black, the accom-
panist, came to full stature as
soloist in some well-judged
Chopin, the Schumann-Liszt
“Devotion,” the Rachmaninoff
Prelude in G Minor and
Sibelius’s “Romance.”
* * * *
At his two Sydney Con. re-
citals Igor Hmelnitsky revealed
in exacting programmes a full-
blooded style combined with a
technique which had a solid
work-out in the Busoni arrange-
ment of Bach’s “Chaconne.”
Each of the variations on the
theme was given lucidly, and,
although taken at rather a slower
tempo than usual, its integration
was never allowed to sag. Scria-
bin’s 12 Etudes grouped as
Opus 8, which clearly reflect the
influence of Chopin on the com-
poser before he branched out
on his “chord of fourths” har-
monic bases, were forthright and
given with controlled strength—
the 3rd in B Minor, the 6th in
A Major and the 12th in C Sharp
Minor were outstanding in a
generally excellent performance.
The Queensland Royal
National Exhibition, otherwise
and more commonly known as
the Brisbane Show, opened last
Saturday with a record crowd
and gate money up £lOOO on last
year—with the night session
added, takings were 50 per cent,
greater than the 1947 opening
day, Saturday was given mainly
to stock-judging, and, as usual,
Herefords, horned and polled,
easily outnumbered all other
breeds. In the Polled Shorthorn
section, Mr. Langmore, of
Jondaryan, cleaned up seven
first and’ four championship
ribbons. Fruit, flowers,
machinery, sideshows, wood-
chops, etc., are better than ever,
and no Show would be complete
without Jimmy Sharman’s
troupe.


Women's Letters
From Sydney
Anne Ziegler and Webster Booth made
a great hit at the Town Hall last week.
These two English singers, already old
friends of Australia by medium of the
radio, have such an easy and smiling
way with them that all the old-fashioned,
rather stiff formula of the concert stage
is laughingly elbowed into the back-
ground. Anne is a pretty creature, and
her frock on the opening night was a
glorious affair of printed chiffon over
cyclamen. It was backless, and the wide,
wide skirt was hooped. The entire front
of the skirt bloomed with one large
dahlia. This was one of those deep wine
shades, the petals touched with white.
In its centre gleamed semi-precious stones
—ruby and emerald. Dahlias were scat-
tered all over the skirt, mingled with
green leaves and mauve tones. Her pale-
gold hair was worn in soft curls close to
the head.
These two artists acted as well as sang
their numbers. While she sang he stood
by the piano, and while he sang she sat
near by listening. She introduced him,
he introduced her. This seems a much
better idea than each scuttling off the
stage after each item and then having to
shuttle back and forth while the ap-
plause demands. Webster is big and
good-looking in a healthy, athletic sort of
way. They really can sing, too —their
Boheme numbers were a delight. Mrs.
E. I. Tait was in the big audience ; so
were Bonnie Howgate and Lindsay Bird.
These two Australian admirers had
grown so fond of the singers whom they
knew by records that 18 months ago they
started to send them food parcels. As
usual, Anne and Webster signed a moun-
tain of programmes. For this there is a
charge of a small coin—the money goes
to Legacy, The two made nearly £3OO
for Heritage, Maoriland’s equivalent of
Legacy, by this means.
If you have a feeling for the past you
will grow quite sentimental over the
Elaine Haxton decorations in Anthony
Hordern’s store, now enjoying its 125th
birthday. You will be fascinated by the
modest replica of the bonnet-shop (set in
a terrace) in King-street in which the
first Anthony ventured his all, and no
doubt put up the shutters every night
and took them down every morning till
the straw bonnets within had captured
the fancy of the dolmaned, the crino-
lined, the sunshade-carrying ladies of the
times. Waterloo was just eight years in
the background; and the good Mrs.
Caroline Chisholm was still the great
stand-by of the girl immigrant, a fact not
overlooked in the window display which
shows a wharf with tall-masted ships
near by, and on the wharf a woman
traveller standing by a piece of luggage
marked Miss , c/o Mrs. Chisholm.
All Sydney’s musical and theatrical
world made for the Royal last Thursday
afternoon. Those stars who were not
scintillating were sitting in d.-c. or stalls
applauding the performers. The house
for the Lute Drummond testimonial
matinee was sold out weeks ago, and the
committee expects about £lOOO in all.
Lady Gowrie and some of Lute’s former
pupils who are now in London, and lots of
country people, among them Mrs. J.
Baxter, of Breadalbane (she was Mrs.
Jessica Lee), contributed to the testi-
monial. The Police Choir singing Schu-
bert’s “Serenade,” soft as cooing doves,
was quite a feature. Strella Wilson, in
black, singing by herself and with John
Dudley, was handsome. Sydney’s own
Gladys Moncrieff, making her first
appearance since her return from Lon-
don, wore a charmful frock of ivory
taffeta filmed in fine black lace. Admired,
too, were Beatrice Tange’s red-gold hair
and creamy skin set off by sapphire-blue
velvets, long and full, the puffed sleeves
caught into a band at the elbow. There
were ballets and Bernard Shaw’s “Dark
Lady of the Sonnets” on the programme,
comedians who really made you laugh,
and a lucky-number competition for a
Lucille Bruntnell doll, drawn on the stage
by Bryson Taylor, and won by himself.
President Florence Taylor read a letter
from Lute. Vice-president Josephine
Marks worked all afternoon, as she had
done for weeks before. Mozart-singer
Gladys Verona .was in the audience, and
Mrs. Persia Porter was early on deck
with a group of V.As. selling programmes.
Manning House at the University was
an impressive as well as pleasant back-
ground fof the reception given by N.S.W.
Women’s Hockey Association to the

States, who are busy in conference con-
cerning the game throughout the Com-
monwealth. From the players in the
tournament the All-Australia team for

she will give to further research and
study. There are about 30,000 students
(day and evening) at the Los Angeles
University and 1000 on the professorial
staff. Carmel leaves in the Aorangi on
August 19. First she is spending a holi-
day at her home in Atherton, where her
father is a \yell-known solicitor.
On their way to Ottawa, Mrs. Ken
Greene, wife of Canada’s High Com-
missioner, and daughter Patsy left Mascot
aerodrome by Skymaster a bit after mid-
night on Sunday morning. As the big
airliner roared off through the night to
meet the dawn and keep its schedule of
48 hours to San Francisco, Mr. Greene
and a group of friends waved au revoir
from the tarmac. Patsy, with a leg in
plaster following a skiing accident at
Kosciusko—she had been having a
marvellous time, too —is returning to re-
sume an interrupted secretarial course in
Boston; Mrs. Greene hopes to be back
in Canberra within two months.
Like every other club, association or
fellowship in Sydney, the Society of
Women Writers encounters difficulty
in finding a permanent address for
its monthly luncheon. Owing to
staff shortages, 40-hour week complica-
tions, increased cost of food, etc.,
the Women Writers have consumed
the midday cold meats garnished
with a lettuce leaf, north, south, east
and west. Its office-bearers have winged
their way, questing as the dove on
Mt. Ararat, and with about as much re-
sult in food value. Now the problem
has to be faced once again. The Girl in
the Flat Opposite says she has got in-
spiration direct from Omar. Why not
a book of verses underneath the bough?
A jug of wine, a loaf of bread, and thou
Beside me singing in the Wilderness.
She.says the whole thing clearly indicates
Taronga Park. And, think of it, if we go
there, there’ll be no more trouble about
getting a fair-dinkum lion as a guest of
honor.
From Melbourne
Lady Gullett picked a rnoneyspinner
to raise funds for the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children when
she persuaded Tommy Harrison to show
his collection of spring hats. For three
days Tommy’s Collins-street salon was
filled with spectators who had cheerfully
paid their half-guineas to watch pretty
mannequins parade in the spring models.
A white boater worn by Mrs. lan Potter
struck an original note with its band of
scarlet ribbon and tiny partially-unfurled
umbrella set on top of the crown. She
also displayed an alluring cocktail hat
fashioned of deep-red roses and green
taffeta ribbon. Mrs. James Buchanan
featured two becoming hats ; one of black
tulle with pink roses set on one side of
the very large brim, the other, a cart-
wheel of layers of pale-beige tulle, was
trimmed with pastel-pink roses and
finished with streamers of apple-green
taffeta ribbon. Mrs. Liz Draffin modelled
a black bonnet, flower-trimmed and with
a large black taffeta bow under the chin.
Lady Gullett was accompanied by her
daughter-in-law, Ruth Gullett, in a
scarlet-and-navy ensemble ; daughter Sue*
Odell was on the committee and assisted
in serving the sherry. Other members of
the committee enjoying the frothy crea-
tions were Mrs. J. V. Fairbairn, smart in
grey tailored suit and large upswept grey-
felt hat banded with London-tan ribbon ;
Mrs. George Armstrong, in an aqua-blue
angora jacket-suit and brown hat with
blue feather trimming, and Mrs. Chester
Guest, wearing a soft-blue wool frock
and matching feather-trimmed hat.
Born in the* blue-grass country of Ken-
tucky, Mrs. Ben Blue, the subject of this
portrait, left her native State to make a
career on the stage. At the end of
1939 she was appearing at the World’s
Fair in the “Congress of Beauty,”
and in 1940 with the “George White
Scandals.” She met and married Ben
while he was starring in the Schubert
production of “Rio Rita,” and she was
also in the cast.' \Vhen they bought a
ranch in California Mrs. Blue left the
stage and settled down as a housewife.
They have two small sons, who are back
in America with their maternal grand-
mother. A great swimmer and lover of
horseback-riding, Mrs. Blue has taught
her two sons to follow in her sporting
footsteps. Bearing the unusual name of
Axie, Mrs. Blue has a great flair for
clothes and the accessories which do so
much to perfect an ensemble. Now at
the Tivoli, she appears in a few of her
husband’s sketches.
Misty pink blossom decorated Christ
Church, South Yarra, when Helen Millis,
younger daughter of Mr. and Mrs. H.
L. Lyall, of Cliveden Mansions, East
Melbourne, became the wife of Iven
John, only son of Lieut.-General Sir Iven
Mackay, formerly High Commissioner
for Australia in India, and Lady Mackay,
of Balwyn. Oyster-pink taffeta-backed
satin fashioned the bridal gown, and a
circlet of pink pearls entwined with
orange blossoms held in place the tulle
veil. The bouquet was of pale-pink
hyacinths. Alison Mackay, the bride-
groom’s younger sister, was the only
bridesmaid; her deep-pink gown,
fashioned with a tiered skirt, was of em-
bossed satin. She carried a bouquet of
pink camellias. Best man was James
Cohen, of Sydney. Later a buffet dinner,
at which the Rev. Murray Scales offici-'
ated, was held at Cliveden Mansions.
There were no sartorial surprises at
Caulfield, when in brilliant sunshine the
first of the Australian Steeplechase meet-
ings was held. One touch about the day’s
fashions was the gaiety of feathers and
quills adorning hats —that and the con-
trasting shade of accessories. Mrs.
Norman Robinson, wife of the V.A.T.CL
chairman, wore a black tailored coat and;
small upturned black hat, which had
ruchings of bright-green taffeta ribbon.
Among her guests at luncheon were Mrs.
J. G. B. McDonald, wife of the Deputy-
Premier ; Mesdames J. F. Evetts, S.
Jurika and Cecil Alley. Making fashion
news was Mrs. Geoffrey Grimwade,
whose winter-white ensemble was worn
with a small matching hat, draped and
tied under the chin. Her ensemble was
finished off with a leopardskin coat.
Mrs. J. V. Fairbairn was smart in grey
tailored suit and London-tan accessories.
Of pleasing effect was the coral-pink wool
coat and beech-brown accessories worn
by Mrs. Peter Andrews.
Wife of the V.A.T.C. secretary, Mrs. H.
R. Way, added an upturned brown-felt
hat with trimmings of green and pink
feathers to her pink frock and dyed-
ermine coat. Mrs. L. Skewes wore a
snug-fitting cap of pastel-pink which
matched the frock worn under a brown
Persian-lamb coat. With her red tailored
coat Mrs, F. Knight wore a black hat
finished with fringed black taffeta ribbon.
Olive Rosenthal’s green tailored suit was
offset by an old-gold felt hat finished
with chenille-dotted veiling. Fawn and
canary-yellow was the color combination
chosen by Mrs. Chester Guest. Mrs.
Harold Rabling wore a small black hat
swathed with tulle and finished with pale-
pink roses with her smartly-cut black
suit and mink coat. A hunter’s-green
wool suit and matching hat were the
choice of Mrs. F. Davies. A long
quill finished the small black worn
by Mrs. Victor Cornaga with Her black
ensemble. Toni Kirkpatrick’s pert little
winter-white cap finished with matching
ospreys was worn with a winter-white
tailored coat.
At a farewell dinner-party given at
Menzies’ by Mrs. Philip Dare for Mrs.
George Moussallay, who, with her hus-
band, was leaving on the Orontes for
England, the hostess wore a black moss-
crepe gown, the skirt featuring a balloon
peplum, into which was tucked a large
spray of French-pink roses. The guest
of honor’s midnight-blue crepes had
scrolls of silver beads forming a pattern
on skirt and bodice, Mrs. Boris Koski’s
white crepe gown had bands of gold
sequins on bodice and sleeves. Mrs. Ron
Dekker was smart in aqua-blue crepe and
short dyed-ermine bolero. A high
Spanish comb held in place a short gold-
lace mantilla worn by Estelle Kemp.
Beads embellished the pastel-blue gown
worn by Mrs. Maurice Dowd.
Marjorie, only daughter of General
and Mrs. W. W. Whittle, of St. Kilda-
road, has announced her engagement to
Cecil Webb, younger son of Mr., and Mrs.
A. G. Burge, of Windsor. Marjorie, an
old Firbank Grammarian, completed her
nursing training at the Royal Melbourne
Hospital last year and is now a Sister
at St. Ives Private Hospital. Cecil was
educated at Haileybury Grammar School.
A cheque for £2750 was presented to
Mrs, R, G.. Casey, who represented the
Board of Management of the Children’s
Hospital, by Mrs. Samuel Fletcher, wife
of the U.S. Consul-General and honorary
president of the American Women’s
Auxiliary, at an afternoon party given at
Banyule, the lovely Heidelberg home of
Mrs. Herbert Allen, who is a member of
the committee. This represented the
proceeds from the highly-successful Coral
Sea Ball run by the American Women’s
Auxiliary to the hospital. Mrs. Fletcher
wore a delightful parma-violet ensemble
and black satin osprey-trimmed hat. Grey
tailorings were the joint choice of Mrs.
Casey and Mrs. Alien. Life governor-
ships to the Children’s Hospital were pre-
sented to four members of the auxiliary ;
Mesdames Gerald Bacon, J. A. Connell,
Mrs. H. Cavehaugh and Mrs. Harold
Rabling, president of the auxiliary,
Ross Stable, George Mitchell and John
Mockridge celebrated the inauguration
of their architectural partnership by giv-
ing a late-afternoon party at the Toorak
home of Col. and Mrs. L. R. D. Stable.
Mrs. Ross Stable assisted her husband
and his partners at the party in an
American Beauty jacket-suit. Her mother,
Mrs. G. A. Mitchell, chose a black frock
and hat and short fur cape. Mrs. Keith
Klingender’s black ensemble was worn
with an off-the-face hat of beige and
black satin. Mrs. Dick Noone’s beige
velvet jacket-suit was worn under an
ermine coat; her black hat was trimmed
with gold-toned ribbon. Mrs. B. Daley
covered her black cocktail frock with a
silver-fox cape. An emerald-green, wool-
jersey shirtmaker-frock with gold orna-
ments .was Rosalind Martin’s choice.
Mrs. J. G. Mason, formerly Tuppy
Farrow, has taken her experiences as a
newspaper woman into the job of organ-
ising the Mental Hospitals’ Auxiliaries
Appeal for After-care Hostels. First
function to raise funds was a New Look-
Old Look Ball in the Malvern Town Hall.
Marie Groves brought grandmother’s ball
gown out of its tissue wrappings for the
occasion. Of rose-pink taffeta, the bustled
full skirt was trimmed with bands or
cream lace and pink fringe. The tight-
fitting bodice, with tiny pearl buttons
down the front, was finished with a deep
bertha collar of lace. Matron Fitz-
gerald’s black poke bonnet almost had
the New Look, with its trimming of black
ospreys and pink roses ; this she wore
with a black-satin crinoline gown and
cream shawl.

THE SERVICE MAN
Communism and
Defence.
“Ek Dum”: The Communist
party very quickly made its
response to the feeble assurances
of Messrs. Chifley and Dedman
about rocket-range secrecy.
They proved at once how feeble
Ministers are in their hands.
The form of their demonstra-
tion was an announcement from
the Building Workers’ Industrial
Union that the Government had
approved an arrangement under
which a panel of union secre-
taries would visit the rocket-
range to inspect “conditions of
work” there.
What the necessity for a panel
of union secretaries to make the
visit might be only the Com-
munist party and Mr. Dedman
could tell, but there is little
doubt about the kind of panel
which will be chosen, as shown
by a glimpse at the list of 32
union leaders who have sent a
“strongly-worded cable of pro-
test to the United Nations
Organisation ....against the
trumped-up charges against lead-
ing members of the American
Communist party,” who have
been arrested in U.S.
Their names were published in
the Communist official organ on
July 31, and are worth publish-
ing as an answer to Mr.
Dedman’s assertion that the talk
about Communist penetration of
the trades-unions and Australian
life is “exaggerated.”
The list, headed by some
members of the Central Com-
mittee of the Communist party:
The 32 signatories to the cable
were: E. Thornton, General Secre-
tary, Federated Ironworkers’ Asso-
ciation; E. J. McPhillips, Assistant
Gen. Secretary, Ironworkers’ Asso-
ciation; J. Healy, General Secretary,
Waterside Workers’ Federation; E. V.
Elliott, General Secretary, Seamen’s
Union; F. Purse, General Secretary,
Building Workers’ Industrial Union;
W. G. Hale, General Secretary, Black-
smiths’ Union; T. Wright, General
President, Sbeetmetal Workers’
Union; J. Whyte, General President,
A. ; J. C. West, General Presi-
dent, Federated Gas Employees’ In-
dustrial Union; I. Williams, General
President, Miners’ Federation.
J. J. Brown, General President,
Australian Railways Union; J. Cran-
well. General President, Amalgamated
Engineering Union; E. Bulmer,
General President, Building Workers’
Industrial Union; J. D. Kenny, Assis-
tant Secretary, Labor Council of
N.S.W.; H. Grant, Secretary, Boiler-
makers’ Union; G. Holden, Secretary,
Plumbers’ Union; Chas. Brown,
Organiser, Boilermakers’ Society of
Australia; V. Goss, Assistant Sec-
retary, Sheetmetal Workers’ Union;
C. R. Ockenden and J. E. Hefferman,
Organisers, Sheetmetal Workers’
Union.
J. Reedie, Secretary, Moulders’
Union; A. Niven, Assistant Secretary,
Moulders’ Union; Len Thompson,
President, N.S.W. Branch Federated
Gas Employees’ Union; L. R. Brook-
man, Secretary, Tanners’ Union;
R. C. Wellard, Secretary, Amal-
gamated Postal Workers’ Union,
N.S.W. Branch; Peter Fallon, State
Secretary, Clothing Trades Union of
A’sia; R. M. Byers, Secretary, 6-
Hour' Day Committee; P. Clancy,
Assistant Secretary, Building Workers’
Industrial Union; J, D. McPhee,
Secretary, Hospital Employees’ Asso-
ciation; Flo Davis, Secretary, Hotel,
Club and Restaurant Employees’
Union; J. R. Hughes, Secretary,
Federated Clerks’ Union, N.S.W.
Branch; E. Rowe and A. Wilson,
Commonwealth Councillors, A.E.U.
It is the first time that the
Communists have deigned to
publish a roll of the real post-
war Cabinet of the Common-
wealth in the Chifley era —the
body which gives its orders to
the feeble fellows who profess
to be the “Government.”
Dr. Makinson’s Statement
Contemporaneously with the
announcement of the impending
rocket-range expedition, the
leading scientist of the Com-
munist party came into the open
to expound the party line on
scientific defence secrecy.
The spokesman was Dr. R. E.
B. Makinson, senior lecturer in
physics at Sydney University,
who was reported by a daily
newspaper as saying that he
had been an “active member of
the Communist party for years
and a chairman of the party’s
science committee”:
If Australia wants to keep military
secrets, it should confine research on
them to military establishments 1
am as good an Australian as any-
body, and I am deeply concerned
with the adequate defence of this
country against aggression. I teach
physics, not politics.
Dr. Makinson can hardly have
read the rules of the Communist
party—especially those provi-
sions in its charter which re-
nounce “hypocritical loyalty,”
with the placing of loyalty to
the Communist party before
loyalty to one’s country, and the
replacement of democracy by a
dictatorship of the proletariat.
A true-red Communist must
believe that Britain and Aus-
tralia and the United States
are Imperialist aggressor
Powers.
Included in the “aggressions”
which he must be ready to fight
against is the aggression of the
law of the land and of the Gov-
ernment. If Dr. Makinson, who
has charge of the minds of
dozens of young Australian
students, does not believe in
these things, and if he does not
subscribe to the Communist-
party system under which the
party can request a commission
on the salary he receives from
the university, if it is required
of him, then he is not a Com-
munist as he says he is.
Research Vital
The position maintained by
Mr. Chifley, Mr. Dedman, Sir
David Rivett —and by Dr.
Makinson and the Communist
party —appears to be that the
universities must not be used for
vital research which needs
to be kept secret in the interests
of the safety of the country be-
cause these bodies employ Com-
munists and they won’t under-
take to observe secrecy from
Russia. The C.S.I.R. similarly
must be sealed off. The latter
has a deadbeat politician on the
executive whose political attitude
has usually been in line
with that of the Communists,
and it has a convicted traitor
who was caught spying dur-
ing the last war—redhanded
in the act of forming an
organisation to collect civil-de-
fence secrets and pass them out
of the country—convicted by a
Court, imprisoned and interned.
He is now designated “Resarch
Officer in the Veneer and Glu-
ing Section” of the Division of
Forest Products of the C.S.I.R.
If this or any other officer
finds anything which may
be of use to the Russians
in the construction of ply-
wood aircraft gluing and
veneers are vital departments of
fast-fighter and light-bomber
aircraft construction, especially
in the jet era —he must be at
liberty, if he feels like it,
to give it to our enemies
in the interests of scientific free-
dom. Therefore, care must be
taken that the department does
no work which will produce
anything whatever of value to
defence if Messrs. Chifley and
Rivett’s theory holds water. A
separate department must be set
up by the Defence Ministry so
that a convicted spy will not be
embarrassed.
C.S.I.R. Departments
The C.S.I.R. has departments
of meteorology (employing a
long roll of research officers). It
has a Division of Electrotech-
nology which is embodied, as is
also its Division of Physics, in
Sydney University. It has a large
Division of Aeronautics which
is brigaded with the aircraft-con-
struction works at Fishermen’s
Bend, a national defence pro-
ject. This has Departments of
Structures and Materials, Metal-
lurgy, Aerodynamics, Engines
and Fuel, Instruments, Applied
Research,
The Department of Industrial
Chemistry is linked with this last
department. It has mineral-
utilisation, cement and ceramics,
foundry sands, physical-
chemistry, chemical - physics,
organic - biochemistry and
chemical-engineering sections. It
has an alunite division working
at Perth University.
There is also a department of
radiophysics located at Sydney
University—dealing with every
phase of the subject which
centres round radar and radio-
communication in general, a
vital feature of defence —per-
haps the most vital; also a
separate Radio Research Divi-
sion and numerous other divi-
sions which deal with matters
integral to defence.
All these vast and growing in-
stitutions employ hundreds of
scientists, and the fact that some
of them are permanent officers
of the defence forces shows that
the scheme of the institution,
which is supported by the taxes
of the community, includes im-
portant research for the military,
naval and air protection of the
country.
Yet notice has been served on
the Commonwealth that what-
ever is discovered by the re-
searches of the C.S.I.R. must not
be considered secret.
The scientists engaged on
them are not sworn to secrecy.
They are being actually en-
couraged by the Prime Minister
in the outlook that anything
they learn with public equip-
ment and at the national expense
is their own to give away to any
foreigner they choose to make
contact with.
If the Defence Department is
“I got the idea from the fun playground , Prendergast."
so unethical by Communist
standards that it intends to keep
what it finds out a secret, let it
set up its own organisation—if
it can. The universities of Aus-
tralia, the C.S.I.R. and its
branches will have nothing to do
with it. They will accept no
bond of privacy.
A Moscow Policy
Since it is impossible to touch
defensive research without cover-
ing the whole field of science,
and without an interchange of
information between British and
American official research insti-
tutes and those of Australia, the
objective which seems likely to
be achieved is not that of our-
selves, but of the U.S.S.R.
The Government policy will
prevent defence research alto-
gether unless this country is
willing to pay its scientists to
work for the benefit of Russia
and any other Communist coun-
try which needs our secrets to
employ in the destruction of our
democratic way of life.
Malayan Horrors
Go On.
“Ek Dum”: The guerrilla
war, a horrible type of war in
which civil inhabitants are
blackmailed and murdered and
the lives of women and children
deliberately threatened as part of
the campaign, is now being
waged in the central areas of
Malaya by the Communists, It
is the more horrible because it
is thoroughly approved by white
Australians of the Communist
party —one of the most vocal of
them a Rhodes Scholar who
has taken all the advantages of
education which a free country
has to give and used them in
abuse of everything British.
It is more horrible still be-
cause the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment’s supporting party nur-
tures these abettors of murder,
and the Commonwealth itself
provides them with telephones
(which business and professional
men find difficulty in getting).
newspaper-postage concessions
and all the other facilities which
are normally denied in sane
countries to the promoters of
sedition.
The Government at Canberra
itself remains unstirred. When
the Cabinet met on August 2
there was no indignant outburst
at the murder of Australian citi-
zens, no assurance that the Gov-
ernment, which a few years ago
was screaming that Malaya was
Australia’s front line and that
Britain must defend it at any
cost, would exact due payment
from the murderers of its citi-
zens. It appears that any blood-
thirsty savage may murder
Australians anywhere without
reprisal so long as that citizen
is not a Communist, in which
case the Central Committee of
the Communist party will in-
sist on action. It happened in
Indonesia, where Australian air-
men and soldiers on an errand
of mercy were done bloodily to
death without causing the rais-
ing of an eyelid ifi Canberra.
The Cabinet, however, de-
cided that if Britain asked for
help directly it would be pre-
pared to do something “within
reasonable limits” —which, of
course, will be decided by the
Communist unions—and “avail-
ability of supplies,” which will
only be available in bulk if Aus-
tralian seamen agree to carry
them.
In the meantime, harassed
Britain, which bore tljie brunt of
the wa» which even Moscow ad-
mits was against the peril of
world Fascism, is forced to send
regiments from home and else-
where to deal with a menace to
the jumping-off place for inva-
sion of Australia, “our front
gate,” as Mr. Curtin called it.
(“Once it is open this country is
doomed to attack. It must be
closed at all costs.”)
A few hours after the Cabinet
decision another Briton, Mr. K.
A. W. Burnham, was brutally
murdered on his plantation in
cold blood with the apparent
approval of white Australian
Communists. The murder, as
usual, was not done by a sup-
posedly oppressed Malay but by
an invading Chinese Communist
gunman.
The same day the Commis-
sioner of Police in Malaya said
that the Government was seek-
ing Australian Owen-guns. At
which the Prime Minister, Mr.
Chifley, said that he was “con-
ferring with the British Govern-
ment” on the question of send-
ing arms.
He was still conferring when
was written.
The Squeeze in Europe.
“Ek Dum”; A censorship like
that of war-time has been
applied to the discussions tak-
ing place between the Soviet
Union Government and the dele-
gates of the British, U.S. and
French Governments in Mos-
cow. It began when Marshal
Stalin entered the arena and
saw the delegates. Little had
leaked out up to August 9, ex-
cept some speculations that
there will be another Foreign
Ministers’ Conference in Europe
and the remark of an unnamed
“high Russian political officer”
that the four great Powers are
“largely reconciled on the Berlin
crisis.”
Meanwhile power restrictions
have cut Berlin’s electricity
supply below war-time levels.
The Russians are threatening to
force down Allied transport air-
craft, on the ground that they
infringe air regulations, and the
general uncertainty is reflected
in the wide choice of prophecy
which readers of Sydney and
other Australian papers buy.
On August 9, “S. M. Herald”
reported in big black type:
“Berlin Future Cloudy.” The
same day Sydney “D.T,” an-
nounced (in bigger black type):
“Optimism on Berlin Reported
... .Closer to Agreement.”
Whatever happens about Ber-
lin, agreement on main issues,
of which the trouble there is
only a symptom, is not closer.
No conferences or arguments
about local details are likely to
alter the Soviet Union plan and
policy which has been now in
existence in concrete form since
1924 to destroy all Govern-
ments opposed to Communism
throughout the world and re-
place them by Communist Gov-
ernments directed from Moscow.
Any surrender to Moscow views
which allows Moscow to advance
an inch along the road on which
it has set out merely brings the
day of open war nearer.
In Europe itself the fate of
the Danube is being decided.
This involves more than merely
the right of free use of that
river. The Danube is one of a
number of large streams which
form a part of the canalised
water-transport through which
the interior of the Continent
is accessible to sizeable steamer
and barge traffic from the sea.
Because of this, its freedom is
an international concern. Britain
and the U.S. have spent large
sums on developing it, and it
serves their occupation zones in
Germany and Austria as well
as the Russian.
Now, headed by the brutal
Vishinsky, a line-up of Soviet
Russia and its Eastern satellites
has decreed, using the language
which is rarely heard outside
gangster motion-pictures, that
the Western Powers are to be
thrown out, without compensa-
tion.
This ejection is being carried
through with every ignominious
detail which Moscow can de-
vise. The British and American
delegates have been spoken to
throughout the conference
almost as if they were criminals.
And the preliminary to all this
was a resolution put forward
from Moscow and carried with
the help of its Eastern European
satellites, which excluded Eng-
lish as an official language of the
meeting and limited official re-
cords to French and Russian.

programme, main event of which was
the Australian Hurdle, won in sterling
fashion by the 9-to-4 favorite Latani.
Those who backed the favorite had
never a moment’s anxiety; those who
backed anything else, never a gleam
of hope.
The rest of the field comprised a
mediocre bunch, and Ron HaU, riding
the favorite, had no hesitation in
giving Latani his head five furlongs
from home. He was easing up to
a canter well before the finish, despite
which he beat Field Balloon by a
generous five lengths, and broke the
course record for the odd distance
of “about two miles, five furlongs
and 65yds.”; his time was 4.53.
Latani carried 12.1, next in the
weights being John Masefield with
10.5. Only two horses have previ-
ously won the Australian Hurdle
carrying 12st. or more; they were
Pooley Bridge in 1936 and Colonel
Shilinski in 1902, both with 12.5.
Smallish, but all horse, Latani is
a six-year-old black gelding by John
James from Falgrass—a full-brother
to the moderate performer Birming-
ham. He is trained by Duncan
Mcßae, whose team of jumpers is
the envy of everyone interested in the
game.
A field of nine started in the Hurdle
and all completed the course. Rather
different was the Godfrey Watson
Steeple, in which seven of the 17
jumpers came to grief, including the
well-fancied David Star. The win-
ner, showing considerable improve-
ment on his previous run at Moonee
Valley when stewards questioned his
performance, was Bronze Laddie (J.
Kennedy), who beat Cheery Boy and
Grey Gull. With the Australian
Steeple in mind, Grey Gull finished
best of the three.
Watching his four-year-old gelding
Vantage (W. Williamson) earn first
money of £7OO by downing Glamis
Star and Sir Marfield with a power-
ful finishing run in the Balaclava
Stakes (12L), owner W. R. Kemball
must have regretted not having forked
over the few pounds necessary to
nominate his horse for the Cups.
Vantage started his run rather wide
out shortly after entering the straight
and fairly outstayed Glamis Star,
though there was only a half-head in
it.
The Elsternwick Stakes for three-
year-old' fillies produced a most ex-
citing finish; after inspecting the first
rush photo, judge Shannon called tor
the second print, which takes a little
longer to produce but is clearer, and
it confirmed that Gay Donna (J.
Gilmore) and Miss Sahib (W.
Richards) had deadheated for first
with Siren Song third. Gay Donna
started at 11 to 2 and Miss Sahib
at 50 to I—a cheerful result for the
bookies. In cases particularly where
a well-backed horse and a real rough
’un are involved, the betting rule
on deadbeats is all the bookmakers’
way.
Last race of the day, the six-
furlongs Moondah Plate was well
worth waiting for, attracting a par-
ticularly good field. Punters generally
seemed to agree with the handicapper,
and the three placegetters, Chanak
(W. Williamson), Ungar and River
Hero, were three of the first four
in the betting and in the weights.
Earlier, divisions of the Mornington
Welter had gone to Saxony (A.
Breasley) and Observe (H. Badger).
* * * *
Including, as it did, two Maiden
races, two Mixed Stakes and a couple
of Welter events, the S.T.C.’s pro-
gramme at Canterbury on Saturday
catered mainly for the poorer-class
gallopers, but glorious weather and
some exciting finishes made amends
for the absence of quality.
A fairly good field, however, con-
tested the Flying (6f.), for which
Deep Sea was topweight with 9st.
and even - money favorite. Deep
Sea managed to run only a dis-
appointing third, the Manitoba horse
Persian Prince (N. Sellwood) finish-
ing stylishly to narrowly defeat the
25-to-l chance Shading. A four-
year-old full-sister to the brilliant
Wattle, and in the same ownership,
Shading should win soon.
Punters had better luck in the
other main event, the Canterbury
Park Handicap (9f.), for which
Karachi (W. Cook) was favorite and
won like the good horse he is.
Karachi had topweight of 9st. and,
ridden a peculiar race, was made
carry it the hard way. Pretty well
last with six furlongs to go, he moved
up sharply to lead into the straight
and was hard-pressed over the last
bit to withstand a strong challenge
from the lightly-weighted Golden
Plumes. Smooth Action also came
home well enough in third place to
suggest a coming win.
Having only her second start in a
race, the four-year-old Le Grand Due
mare Darling was a hot favorite for
the second Three- and Four-year-old
Maiden, but punters did their cash
about the bitterest way possible.
Hitting the front at the leger, Darling
was lengths clear nearing the post
when her rider (V. Faggotter) over-
confidently eased her up. In a tnce
Mulley, on the 10-to-l chance
Monarchy, saw his opportunity and
dived for it, to win by a half-head.
Although he should never have won
Monarchy did nevertheless run an
excellent race. Faggotter was sus-
pended for two months.
Connections of Mirrigen had cause
to reflect on the oddities of racing
luck when, in the first Welter (6f.),
their Marconigram gelding for the
fifth time in succession finished
second; he was beaten a half-head
by Lucky Escape (W. Cook). The
second Welter went to All Gold (N.
Sellwood) with Sonning, in second
place, showing a trace of her earlier
promise. In the Burwood Mixed
Stakes (9f.) the Ajax horse Faraway
justified his odds-qn favoritism, while
the Campsie Mixed of 11 furlongs
went to another favorite in Cardinal
Colour (N. Sellwood). The first
Maiden Stakes went to Avail, ridden,
in odd coincidence, by V. Faggotter.

Any punter bitten with the notion
that money is to be made at racing
by following a leading jockey should
be sentenced to one hour’s concen-
trated perusal of the table of jockeys
performances for the past season.
About the best percentage any ot
the‘leading Sydney riders managed
was one winner for every f9ur un-
placed mounts, and that is ignoring
the large number of minor placmgs.
Thompson at the head of the list
had 63i winners, 47 seconds, 34*
thirds and 243 unplaced. Thirteenth
on the list, D. Munro, whose mounts
are always well backed, had 11 win-
ners, 44 unplaced and 31 minor
placings. Quite the best Sydney
average was put up by H. Badger,
whose brief trips north yielded six
winners, seven minor placings and
only five unplaced. At the other
end of the scale one rider had two
winners against 126 unplaced mounts.
* * * *
The Games:
The outstanding individual com-
petitor at the Games has been the
Dutchwoman, Mrs. Fanny Blankers-
Koen, winning the ladies’ 100-metres
and 200-metres sprints and the 80-
metres hurdles as well as being a
member of the winning 400-metres
relay team —a remarkable perform-
ance, and the more so since the lady
is. 32 years of age and has two
children. It was a bit stiff for Aus-
tralia’s Shirley Strickland that she
should have bumped such an excep-
tional performer.
Nevertheless Shirley has thoroughly
justified her selection as No. 1 in
the Australian team; she reached
three individual finals to score two
thirds and the closest of fourths and
also ran in the relay, in which the
Australian girls were beaten by four
inches in the final.
Taken all round the Australian
team has put up a grand perform-
ance, appearing in some 20 finals and
bagging, at the time of writing, 13
Olympic medals, with more to come;
six of the 10 girls in the team col-
lected medals. Our most pronounced
flops have been in the team events,
neither the four-oar crew nor the
water-polo team having done any-
thing to justify the disproportionate
expense of sending teams for single
events.
Australian medal - winners io the
track and field events have been John
Winter (first in high jump), T. Bruce
(second in long jump), George Avery
(second in hop, step and jump),
Shirley Strickland (third in 100 metres
and 80-metres hurdles), and the girls’
team finished second in the 400-
metres relay. In the water place-
getters were Nancy Lyons (second
in 200-metres breaststroke), Judy Joy
Davies (third in 100-metres back-
stroke), and John Marshall (second
in 1500-metres and third in 400-metres
freestyle events). Wrestlers Garrard
and Armstrong finished second and
third in their respective divisions.
The most pleasing feature of the
Games has been an almost complete
absence of the petty squabbling and
rows which have marred every past
gathering, and the Australian team
has done a particularly good job
of polishing up the rather spotted
reputation of Australian sportsman-
ship.

The cricketers: —
The Australians waged battle with
the counties last week. Rain washed
out the game v. Glamorgan at Swan-
sea (Glamorgan 197: Australia 215
for 3 wickets), and Warwickshire was
walloped at Edgbaston by nine
wickets. In these matches, Miller
(84) and Hassett (71) against
Glamorgan, and Hassett (68) against
Warwickshire, were the highest
scorers for the tourists; bowlers
Johnston, Johnson and Lindwall each
bagged six wickets. Thirty-six-year-
old Eric Hollies, of Warwickshire,
a right-hand spin bowler, was the
star turn of the Edgbaston match,
taking 8 for 107 in the first innings,
and the only wicket that fell in the
“When I said ‘Keep your eye on the ball I didn’t mean
you to go that far !”
second digs. Hollies has been a.
consistent wicket-demolisher in Eng-
lish cricket—l7s wickets in 1946 and
116 in 1947 being his post-war efforts
—?ind, by dismissing all 10 bats
in an innings in 1946, he equalled
the only similar one-man effort in
English cricket, made by J. Wisden
in 1850. Strange that such a flower
of the game should have been left
to blush unseen so long during the
present tour; however, he has been
included in those named for .the fifth
Test, along with other newcomers in
Dewes, Simpson and Watkins.
Cranston, Crapp, Laker and, inex-
plicably, Pollard are in the discard.

Taking it easy against South Mel-
bourne on Saturday, Essendon had
no trouble to score 11.21 to 8.11
and lead “the four.” The Dons seem
to have the premiership sewn up,
Fitzroy having faded out and Col-
lingwood still licking its injured vanity
after the defeat at Geelong. Satur-
day’s big game was the Richmond-
Melbourne affair, at which 40,000-
odd saw the Tigers dust Melbourne
off to the tune of 15.16-6.8. Out
at Footscray the locals and Carlton
capered before a bored and sarcastic
crowd for Carlton to collect 15.19
to 4.17. It’s Essendon on top, Col-
lingwood, Fitzroy, Richmond and
Melbourne in the hunt.

In the Rugby Union match of the
day at University Oval St. George,
too anxious to stop centre Jack
Bloraley, allowed other University
backs to get through, losing the game
17-20. University, however, lost men
piecemeal through injuries, breakaway
Brockhoff being put into the back
line, where he proved uncommonly
useful. St. George and University,
with 18 points each, are now in the
semi-final running, Easts is below
them with 17 points, Gordon has
19 and Randwick is well ahead with
24. Randwick, however, was downed
6-12 try Drummoyne on Saturday.
Easts beat Wests 17-6, Manly beat
Parramatta 22-6, and Gordon beat
Norths 28-3.

Ken Goddard (10.7) had advan-
tages of height, reach and weight over
his Leichhardt opponent George
Sands, but made little use of them,
seldom venturing a straight left and
allowing Sands to do all the early
attacking. Surviving several moments
when he seemed ripe for a k. 0.,
Goddard fought back well to win
the last few rounds —but too late,
Kenneth, too late!


ABORIGINALITIES
“Ned”: Old Charlie Bannister had
been using the moonlight to try to get
his wheat into the ground, and he was
far from pleased on receiving a curt sum-
mons to be in town at a stipulated time
on a stated day. It was night before
the imperative business was finished, and
pretty dark as the old mare was settling
into her stride on the road out of the
township. Charlie was sourly grizzling
about his thickheadedness in forgetting
to get a bottle of mm when a light was
flashed on him and a stern voice wanted
to know where his lights were. “Gripes,
y’re not goin’ to book a man, are y’?”
inquired the awakened Charlie. “You’re
a mind-reader,” enlightened the cop. “But
y’ know a man can’t get candles,” pleaded
Charlie. “Tell that to the Court,” the
John advised, “What’s your name?”
While he was licking his pencil Charlie’s
wits began to work. “Righto, mate, but
send the stiff t’ the sheriff,” he directed.
“The sheriff? What’s he got to do with
it?” the Law demanded. “The blarsted
lot,” retorted Charlie. “If it hadn’t been
f’r him I wouldn’t have been sittin’ on
the flamin’ jury till after the pubs closed
t’ help you blokes send along the cove
that pinched Martin’s heifers.” The cop
pocketed his book and handed Charlie
his torch. “Switch this on if you meet
that young galoot who drives the cream
truck,” he counselled, “Safe home, Mr.
Bannister.”

“Old-timer”: Arumpo, which every
Riverina roamer has crossed, camped at,
heard about and lied about for over 80
years, has ceased to be a station, and
though its 150,000-odd acres have been
cut up among adjoining properties it will
still be Arumpo for generations to come.
Back in the ’sixties, when Tarcoola
covered most of western Riverina,
Arumpo was only a hut. It became a
station when the A.M.L. and F. people
took over Tarcoola from the Darchies
and cut it up to form Pan Ban, Garnpang,
Top Hut, Prungle, Balranald and
Arumpo. About 30 years ago some of
the leases ran out, Arumpo being the
only one left; and now it has gone. It
was the head station after Tarcoola, but
after the general sale the other week most
of the plant and buildings seem likely to
go to other places. It also seems
that the 1944 drought put Arumpo out —
it lost about 10,000 sheep and 100 horses,
and the flying sand cut the old homestead
pine logs and the garden to pieces. When
Balderdash Jones, Stepper McCormick,
Casey and me came down from Kilfera
years ago we went through Gol Gol in
one of those blind-white Riverina fogs,
got slewed and held a consultation.
Stepper reckoned Arumpo was due south ;
we held for west. Stepper went his way
and we went ours. Two nights later we
three were greeted by lights, buildings,
dogs and men at Arumpo. iSvo months
later we got word of Stepper; - working
for a plumber at Quambatook, in Vic-
toria. Casey went to Broken Hill, Balder-
dash took on a contract to'whitewash the
border fence and I—well, I went to Mel-
bourne to see if I could do a deal over
quandong buttons for waistcoats with a
Footscray tailor.

“The Pirate”:- Residents of Geelong
(Vic.) were treated to a strange sight last
week when two large whales cruised
around the harbor, close inshore and
blowing water 20ft. in the air. The
mammals are almost unknown in the
bay, and the two must have been first-
rate navigators—or explorers—to fluke
finding the narrow artificial Hopetoun
Channel leading into Corlo Bay. Whales
are also a rarity in Port Phillip, prob-
ably because of the mile-wide heads and
the proximity of steamers, which, unlike
sailing vessels, usually frighten the ani-
mals. Incidentally, the last time the
leviathans entered the port-—November,
1943—they caused a panic. They were
mistaken for midget submarines.
* * * *
“Coral Cod”; The awful effects on
white inhabitants of Australia’s tropical
climate was demonstrated recently at
Lucinda Point, near Ingham (N.Q.), when,
playing a big salmon he had hooked, a
fisherman stumbled and fell into the sea.
A racing tide banged his head and legs
against the wharf-piles studded with
razor-sharp oyster-shells. When some
wharfies eventually rescued him he almost
had to be held back from hopping in
again after the catch, still somewhere on
the hook. After a few hundred pieces
of shell had been pulled out of him this
debilitated example of the white man’s
tropic deterioration was back at his
angling again. He’ll only be 81 next
birthday.

“Bosun’s Mate”; Sailors are a versatile
mob. Before their servicing reverted to
the Director of Navigation, boom-defence
vessels helped to maintain lights on the
reef and in New Guinea waters. By day
the only indication of the reef on which
the light stands, a tripod braced with
steel against the heavy seas which on
occasions rear over it, is a patch of foam-
ing white where waves break on the
barely-visible niggerheads of coral. They
are lit usually by canisters of acetylene
gas, longer-lasting and more reliable than
electricity. Once on Spear Island, an
uninhabited clump of bush-clad coral in
the Bismarck Sea, the naval inspecting
party found the light-tower leaning
drunkenly over a great hole in the coral
gouged by heavy seas. The team got to
work. They dug down into the coral
rock and filled the hole with bags of
cement. Then four heavy steel girders
were sunk upright in it. Working with no
“ She’s off her tucker today—that Bulli soil is too rich.”
specialised knowledge of structural
engineering those matelots rebuilt the
60ft. steel tower on its new foundations
and secured the big light to its top when
they finished. It’s still there.

“Lower Tops’l”: Rear-Admiral Collins
mentioned recently that his first sea voy-
age was down the bay 40 years ago,
when he boarded the stout, bluff-bowed
ketch Helen Moore at Little Dock, bound
for Momington. The skipper, Captain
Bob Parry, somewhat shattered his boy-
hood illusions by wearing a dilapidated
felt hat in place of a nautical cap, but
just the same, the Admiral said, the Helen
Moore was essentially a sailing-ship carry-
ing essential cargo—principally beer —
and so she was. For years, arriving
mostly each Sunday with general cargo
and sailing every Thursday,, the Helen
Moore was the pride of Momington.
Before those days, around 1905, she was
a Holyman-line freighter under the com-
mand of Captain Roy Holyman, lifting
bullocks from Flinders Island. Today the
vessel carries stranger cargoes than
embryonic admirals and longhorns. Re-
named the Jolly Roger and festooned with
colored lights, the old hooker leaves
Princes Bridge every night on cruises up
the Yarra freighting lovers and pleasure-
seekers.

“Mat’s Mate”: It was bush week or
something in Murrayville, and when we
blew off the train into the pub there was
nothing between us and several long cool
beers except most of the local cockies,
townsmen, shophands, their friends, rela-
tives and acquaintances. After several
vain efforts to get through the press to
the bar Mat withdrew, hauling me with
him. “Hang on an’ look serious till I
get back,” he commanded, and made for
a store. He came back with a tape-
measure, shoved one end into my hand,
placed me in a comer, ran the tape along
the bar-wall, ordering fellows out of his
way and shouting mysterious figures at
me. Presently the crowd was obligingly
making way, supposing us to be health
inspectors or something. Soon we had
the tape running along the bar-counter,
whereupon the publican asked, “Hey,
what’s going on?” “We’re from the
Guv’ment,” Mat said, coldly. “They’re
runnin’ a branch railway out to Duddo.
Give us four pots, quick; we got t’ get
this measurin’ done.” We got the pots
and downed them. Mat rolled the tape,
babbled more figures at me, then turned
to the widp-eyed crowd and said, “Well,
it’s all right. It won’t come through here,
anyway. Give us another two pots,
Mister.” About then the crowd woke up,
but it was too late. We were firmly fixed
at that bar.
• * * *
“G. 8.”: Able to lay claim as being
among Australia’s most brilliant psycho-
logists, I have, nevertheless, been
bewildered by this man Mat, and as much
by his mate, for who would be mate to
this Mat? At last, however, I have the
solution to this fellow’s depravity, his
complexes and the like. These columns
(21/7/’4B) tell me that, on being refused
a mixture of rum and water by the leader
of an opposing tribe, “He outmarked and
outbumped the Walpe. skipper, fell on
him, sat on him, ran him ragged; he
dominated the rucks, won the knock-
outs, fed rover and forwards and Undo-
wangie, inspired, slapped on 8.7 and
cantered in.” Intrigued, I wrote to the
Aborigines Protection Board, but was in-
formed this was no aboriginal rite, corro-
borees on the whole being fairly gentle
ceremonies. Discussing the matter with
a southern visitor I was told that this is
the game played in those parts, faint re-
semblance to the civilised game of foot-
ball being detectable. However, it has
completely laid bare to me the rugged
and uncivilised state of the Mat fellow,
and I am surprised and shall be surprised
at nothing, not even his determined
misogyny. As for myself I shall continue
to patronise that effete game of a de-
cadent civilisation —football.
* * * *
“Gravelspatcher”: Cuttlefish may be
responsible for those scars on sharks,
although I’ve always thought of the squid
as a comparatively defenceless item on a
big fish’s menu. It’s the tastiest morsel
in the ocean —you can’t beat squid for
bait—and the fact that cuttlefish-beaks are
always found in ambergris indicates that
that whale is partial to the cuttle. In fact,
it’s sometimes regarded as the source of
ambergris. Still, a squid fighting for its
life may inflict some wounds even on a
shark’s hide. But has anyone ever seen
a big fish with a head-wound scar? An
old fisherman with experience of most
big fish told me he’d never seen one.
Reckoned the fish either didn’t get head
wounds, or didn’t survive them.
* * * *
“Nor’-west”: Can’t agree with “Plank-
ton” (B. 14/7/’4B) that the suckers of
the octopus are soft and fleshy—rather
are they horny and gristly. If “P.”
had ever dined on octo. he would have
realised this —by the growing heap of
suckers around the edge of his plate.
But for these suckers octopus might be-
come a popular dish in city restaurants.
Certainly there are few things that can
beat stewed octopus. Pounded with a
flat piece of wood or a rasp, the tentacles,
when stewed slowly for a couple of
hours, and seasoned with onion, are rich
in flavor. But the suckers, requiring
as they do to be sieved through the
teeth, are a handicap to polite diiflng.
But if octo. isn’t first macerated before
cooking it emerges from the pot the
texture of rubber.
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”: When is a snake dead,
anyway (B. 21/7/’48)? If decapitation
establishes demise, then I know a young
fellow who was bitten by a dead snake.
Fully 10 minutes after the axe had done
its job the youth picked up the tiger’s
severed head, opened the mouth and be-
gan to gather a little firsthand knowledge
on the position of the poison-fangs. He
located them exactly—when the jaws
snapped on the investigating finger. The
nervous reflexes that cause such things,
combined with the fact that a snake, being
coldblooded, may writhe spasmodically
many hours after death, are no doubt re-
sponsible for the they’ll-die-with-the-
setting-sun supposition. But I had proof
that the sun exercised no power on a
dead or dying Joe when. I was 10 years
old. It was my first scalp—a 2ft. 6in.
brown that broke up every time the
heavy (for me) sliprail descended on
him. After the pieces had finished danc-
ing their mad fandango on the raw ends,
I raked the head-end into a rusty kero.-
tin and proudly bore home my victim.
Some time during the night I awoke with
the idea that my trophy should be pre-
served for posterity in methylated spirits.
In stealth and reasonable silence I had
pinched the metho. and was just about
to pick up the limp, thin scrap of snake
when it nearly scared me out of my night-
shirt : the head rose up fully 4in., swayed
momentarily, then collapsed. And at
that moment the carved clock on the
mantelpiece chimed —midnight. Five and
a half hours after sunset.
* * * *
“Tilga”: Without doubt the new arrival
was a mine of information. He could,
and did, tell the wheatfarmer of the latest
methods of cultivation, the varieties most
suited to the district, when to sow, what
fertilisers to use. His advice to the
sheepman, the orchardist, the vegetable-
gardener was garnished with most im-
pressive terminology. The storekeeper,
the motor-mechanic and the carpenter
all had the benefit of his great knowledge,
freely given. Then he went to buy a
new axe-handle, but shortly afterwards
returned it, asking for one slightly
smaller, as the first was “just too large
to go into the hole in the axe.”
* * * *
“Nemo”: As she handed over Ford-
son’s “nearly second-best” gabardine
breeks to Taffy, the homestead rabbiter,
Mrs. F. obtained his solemn promise not
to wear the casings until he reported for
Christmas dinner, some months hence.
Three days later a somewhat shamefaced
Taffy was confronted by the indignant
Mrs. F. “You know you promised not
to wear those pants till Christmas!” she
exclaimed. “And look at them now!”
And she pointed to the rammies covered
in the gore of innumerable bunnies. “But,
missus,” stuttered Taffy, “y’r husband
won’t recognise ’em, and they’ll still be
jake for Christmas —I’m wearin’ ’em
inside-out! ”
+ * * *
“Uramao”: Too much wipiro and fol-
lowing the race-meetings landed the
affairs of Hori in such a mess that the
Official Trustee took over the assets and
summoned the Maori to attend a meet-
ing of creditors to explain his position
and make what offer he was able to
satisfy them. Smiling benignantly at the
circle of sordid money-grubbers Hori
listened attentively to the trustee reading
out a list of his assets. “Two hundred
electric-light bulbs, half a dozen tyre-
levers, thirty screwdrivers, a dozen
packets of soothing-powder.” “By cripe,”
broke in the beaming Hori, “I know w’at
I do. I gif te packets of soothing
powders to te creditors! ”

“8.A.K.”: Stumpy was sceptical
about phrenology, and the new hand
offered to demonstrate the alleged science
on the doubter’s cranium. Running his
bony fingers through the little bloke's
black, shaggy mop, the new hand said
“This is where we find the bump of deter-
mination. And hullo! What have we
here? By jove, I’ve never seen such a
bump of cupidity! ” Before he’d finished
speaking Stumpy was bowling over-
arms upwards at the long ’un’s chin.
If the fight wasn’t damaging or spectacu-
lar it was willing. When lack of wind re-
duced both contestants to the glaring stage,
Stumpy panted “That’ll teach you not
to say my head’s a burhp of stupidity.”

“Hanko”; We were tinkering at the
chaff-cutting plant when the boss gave
a surprised whistle. “ ’Struth, look what’s
cornin’.” Up the home paddock from
the roadway advanced a turkey gobbler,
his wings ascrape, his wattles flushing
and paling alternately. The bird strutted
into the yard, made a pass at the clothes’
prop, and set up a defiant gobbling.
“Now tell me farmin’ don’t pay,”
chuckled the trump. An hour later Luke
Tanser rode in. “Don’t suppose y’ see
anythin’ of a turkey,” he said. “It musta
dropped orf me truck, a prime bird it
was, too.” He glanced around and eyed
the bird that was ploughing the dusty
yard with its wings. “It was a bigger an
better bird than that bloke there,” he
said. “Fat as mud, it was. I was takin
it in for the postmaster. Conner do a
bit of cuffin’? Aw, well, I suppose rne
turkey is a blue duck. So long.” The
boss selected a spanner with delibera-
tion. “When I was a kid,” he said, }
remember scrawlin’ ‘Silence is golden’ n>
me copy-book, an’ I thought it was bunk.
But it’s right, all right. It can win y
a turkey.”
“LIGHTEN OUR DARKNESS.”
Now that the season’s pendulum is swung
No further southward into winter’s cold,
With candelabra of bright wattle-gold
The dull steeps of the Dandenongs are hung.
And from their crooked ladders, rung by rung,
Torch after torch the gloomy hills .behold
Lighting that method, new lamps for the old,
Earth has made use of, ever since earth was
young.
Building fresh beauty on a newer lease
Over old discard and autumnal dross —
But in the world of men all seems amiss:
Agony piles on agony, loss on loss,
With hope suspended over an abyss,
Hate on high banners, truth upon a cross.

“Solitude”: Young Crowther is a
blowhard at best, and when Seventyfiver
spotted him dropping off at the hut early
the other morning his dial settled into
the sphinx-like expression he uses for such
encounters. “Bit nippy,” the visitor
greeted. “Though, mind you, I been
workin’ in .a much colder place lately.
D' y’ know, I leave the house in the
mornings, an’ by the time I’ve walked
down to work the outside of my thick
bluey coat is frozen stiff with ice! See
you’ve had a bit of a frost here, too,
this morning.” “Don’t think so.” The
old bloke looked round dazily at the
snow-white landscape and ice-encrusted
ground, and again shook his head. “No,
couldn’t ’ve,” he announced. “There’s
the patch I emptied the tea-billy the other
day.” “G’on, don’t be silly,” the other
challenged. He pointed to thick
white coating on the grass. “What’s that,
then?” “Aw, that” —Seventyfiver waved
it aside contemptuously —“that’s just a
bit o’ hangover left from a touch o’
frost we had the week before last.”

“Bo”: Alf Dennett, the redheaded
timbergetter, was hot under where his
collar wduld have been if he wore one.
“That bloodsuckin’ coot Rayner at the
Store can go to hell for mine,” he said.
“Qne and a kick for a packet o’ razor-
blades! I wouldn’t give the old cow the
satisfaction —I’m go in’ into Wungooli to
get ’em —I see ’em in there for a bob.”
And into Wungooli he went. About 10
days later Alf returned, red-rimmed of
eye, and feeling chockful of self-pity.
It seemed he’d struck a few cronies in
Wungooli, the mild bender had developed
into a ripsnorter, he’d drawn every bean
out of his bank account, had spent four
days during which he’d kept his hand in
with the axe, not on standing trees but
the constable’s woodheap; but he had
one gleam of triumph left. From his
pocket he pulled a miniature packet.
“Well,” he croaked, “I got me blades—
a zack cheaper than Rayner’s. This'll
teach the old blankard not to be so much
of a flamin’ profiteer in future!”

“Betcha”: During recent test broad-
casts a Victorian studio made merry cari-
caturing the town of Bulumwaal (pro-
nounced locally, Bull-um-all). This little
hard-to-find place is tucked into a corner
of the State’s Alps country. The town
has no modern amenities, neither is it
concerned with a railway, telephones, gas
shortages or labor strikes. Paying for
its name on the map with the alluvial
washed from its bushy gullies, it has re-
“ Let's go home, George; it's beginning to get chilly."
maimed to struggle on gamely as a
pastoral community. My early recollec-
tions of the spot are sadly mixed up
with a mob of Herefords. Pushed for
time, and with a mob to take through
from Bairnsdale to the old Omeo Gap
district, we decided to shortcut across
the ranges and save a day. We would
follow a rough bullock-track to Bulum-
waal, and thereafter our sense of direc-
tion. Night was closing in when we
spotted the little mining town ahead, and
my offsider rode on to see about a pad-
dock to hold the bailies. Inquiry at the
post-office brought permission from the
girl within to turn them through slip-
rails a few hundred yards along the track.
Unfortunately she was unable to notify
her widowed mother of the arrangement,
and hearing the commotion of our arrival
the old lady came trotting along to in-
vestigate, swinging a Lighted lantern.
Took us two long days collecting the mob
from the surrounding bush.

“Chevroford”: Even the shark has be-
come respectable in this Golden Age of
Chifley. Time was when the word carried
the most sinister connotation. Now, in
Melbourne at any rate, where the popu-
lation dotes on it or at any rate has to
eat it, it has become so holy that the
Chief Inspector of Fisheries is seriously
considering declaring the brute a pro-
tected animal under the Act. Large-scale
shark-fishing—dozens of ex-servicemen
are making big money out of it with the
aid of converted scows obtained from
Disposals—has so thinned their numbers
that there is talk of closing some grounds
and fixing the size at which the monster
must be returned to the ocean. One of
the excuses given for the recent slaughter
of seals at Phillip Island was that seals
had been found with as many as a dozen
small sharks in their stomachs.

“Lower Tops’!”: One of Australia’s
lighthouse-keepers who, because of special
qualifications, is unlikely to be trans-
ferred elsewhere is Harry Smithem, who
Operates the gleam on Swan Island, the
low, grey, granite-bound two-mile-by-one-
mile atoll H miles off Tassie’s nor’-east
comer. For be it known that Harry is
also an ox-conductor—that was why he
got the job 12 years ago. From the jetty
he drives his team of eight Shorthorns
across the sand dunes to the lighthouse
with stores. Anyway, a stockman is
needed at “The Swan”—they run a
number of cattle, besides several hundred
sheep. And why don’t they run horses,
and cart with horse and lorry? Simply
on account of the sand, which in dry
seasons kills the neddies.
* * * *
“G’roper”: Of course it may sound
sheer slavery in these 40-hour-week
times, but what was wrong with that
cocky’s offer of £1 a chain for post-
and-wire fencing (B. 14 /7 / ’48)? Just
after No. 1 World War I used to sink
holes for a fencing contractor who would
cut out and erect 6ft., close-picketed
fencing for £1 a chain. And that
meant some going, with all the labor of
nailing the pickets on. But here’s how.
While he mortised the posts and cut the
rails to length I dug the holes—in sand,
it is true. Then up went the post and
rails. As fast as he could nail, two nails
to each, I fed the pickets into place and
held them while the top nail went in.
We did three chains in eight hours. He
paid me £1 a day; took the other two
for himself. And unless the day was
hot we seldom raised a sweat.

“Zake”: Steve was on his way per
sapling-stretcher from the railway-con-
struction camp to the road where the
ambulance was to pick him up, the victim
of overconfidence in the aim of a fellow-
wielder of the pick, just behind him, who
was recovering from a jag. Roaring Jim,
the big ganger, was in the throes of filling
in a departmental form which called for
all the details of the accident. The casualty
had been the only one in the camp with
any pretensions to scholarship, and as he
was far from being either in condition
or mood to help Jim with the form before
he departed the ganger was thrown back
on his own meagre resources of pen-
manship. Before he’d finished with the
first two questions Jim s tongue was a
bright puce from the indelible pencil. A
description of the accident itself took
almost an hour of agonised thought. As
his eye caught the final column, “Re-
marks,” he breathed with relief and was
just about to begin with relish when
something crossed his mind —he frowned,
then, after much deep thought, wrote in
the column: “It don’t seem rite puttin’
down what Steve said when the pick got
him wair sum typist mite see it. I’ll
shove it in a seeld envelope.” And that’s
what he did,

“Gumsucker”: Left-handers used to be
highly valued in the old days when steam-
hammers were scarce and quite big forg-
ings—say, Sin. battery-stems —used to be
welded over the anvil. To catch the weld
“He must have a hangover—it Was lodge-night last night”
while it was still plastic was a two-
hammer job. But two right-handers just
couldn’t work, since they both would
have swung from the horn end of the
anvil. A left-hander swung from the
swage end, where the square hole was,
and so, neither in the other’s way, a
right- and left-handed pair could keep
their sledges falling, one up and one
down, in a way that was pretty to see.

“Eastern”: The missus didn’t object
to Bob going over to Charlie’s for a
game of cards provided he was home
early. Bob sought to evade the restric-
tion by creeping in without waking his
earbashing partner. He took the dogs
with him so they wouldn’t herald his
return, pulled off his boots at the back
door, and creeping over the step fell
in headlong. Mrs. Bob lit the lamp,
glanced at the clock, and opened up.
On his next excursion Bob was even
more careful. His lengthy opening of the
back door was a masterpiece. Stealthily
he slid one socked foot forward in the
darkness, brought up the other, then . . .
crash! He brought down a chair and a
whatnot, while his flying boots smashed
a flower-bowl and scattered the contents.
His outraged missus was still holding
forth next morning as she collected the
withered decorations. “Yes, and flowers
are hard enough to grow, too,” she
rambled on. “ With that poking brute of
a cow you’ve got around chewing every-
thing. I don’t know why you keep the
thing.” “Me new springer!” Bob’s
eyes narrowed thoughtfully. “Awright.”
He pointed to a big black mouser that
watched him warily from the step. “Tell
y’ what,” he bargained. “I’ll sell Dais,
if you’ll get rid o’ that blasted booby-
trap there, an’ get a white cat.”

“The 0.D.”: If psychologists have come
to “the conclusion that those birds and
animals which freeze into immobility on
the approach of danger and are pro-
tected by their neutral camouflage color-
ing are not being so smart after all” (B.
4/8/’4B), then the psychologists have out-
smarted themselves, particularly when
they suggest that the immobility is caused
by a fear-paralysis. Anybody who has
been deluded into thinking that he could
grab a frozen bunny, lark, field-mouse
or nesting plover will find the supposed
paralysis replaced by instant movement
the moment his hand approaches the
quarry. Don’t talk to me about sleepy
lizards —they don’t care.

“C.E.”: It was just before shearing,
with the jumbucks carrying a heavy
fleece, and riding past Danvers’ place
Ron noticed a ewe down. A mile further
on, seeing Danny mending a fence, he
stopped to tell him of the cast woolly.
“Gripes, why didn’t y’ get off an’ give
her a shove up?” the owner lamented.
“Now I got t’ ride all the way down
there just t’ kick the thing over on to her
legs. See what I mean?” Ron apolo-
gised, agreeing he should have done so,
but hadn’t thought of it at the time.
Half an hour further on he spotted an-
other woolly down. This time it was in
Tightfist Charlie’s. Ron hitched his nag,
walked up the gully, and tried to stand
the animal on its legs. Immediately it
dropped its head and sulked. He perse-
vered for a bit, then decided he’d shift the
pigheaded brute over on to a dry slope,
where it could get up itself, later. He
was half-carrying, half-dragging it when
from the ridge came a clatter of hoofs
and an angry bellow. “Caught- in the
act, eh?” roared Tightfist. “Yair, I been
losin’ fat sheep out o’ this paddock for
some time, me lad, an’ by cripes, now
y’re gonner pay for the lot!”

“Argumentative Mac”: The maggies
around Drouin in Gippsland are being
found dead everywhere, hanging by the
feet from the branches of trees. Investi-
gation shows that their claws have be-
come entangled with fibres as thick as
human hairs, making them bumble-
footed. The result is that when alight-
ing they aren’t able to grasp the perch,
and, invariably while endeavoring to get
a footing, the fibres become caught in
knots, bark and broken twigs. The
’pies’ plight has been traced to the waste-
heap beside the local flax-mill where the
birds feed on grubs. A similar happen-
ing occurred in the vicinity of a flax-mill
near Ballarat some time ago, when all
the doves in the district were killed off.
* * * *
Always thought groundlarks,
those drab-grey-and-brown smallish birds
one flushes everywhere on the open
plains about Victoria, stuck to certain
territories. Perhaps they do, but market-
gardeners between Dandenong and Chel-
tenham (Vic.) during winter months have
to stand sentry and shoot great numbers
of them as they devour rows of young
lettuces as fast as they come above
ground.

“Telarb”: Despite the efforts^ of the
church in Torres Strait, pourri-pourri is
on the increase instead of on the way out.
Local island councils have authority
under the bylaws to inflict punishment
ranging from three weeks in the boob
to permanent banishment, but such is the
power of the evil eye that few councillors
care to invite personal annihilation by
pinching a pourri-pourri expert. Saibai
had an outbreak recently, when seven old
blokes killed off a few of the residents
with a mixture of suggestion, alligator-
teeth and perhaps something more
directly potent. Some of the culprits
were carted off to Palm Island and the
rest were brought down to Thursday
Island jail, where they now languish pend-
ing D.N.A.’s making up its official mind
what to do with them. The Reggie P.,
1.1.8.’s cargo boat, is usually rushed by
the islanders for a fast, free trip to
Thursday Island, but the day she brought
down the sorcery exponents the initial
enthusiasm of the hitchhikers from the
various islands en route underwent a
rapid change when they heard who was
on board, and almost without exception
they decided they might as well work
this “clear water” and go in next time.
* * * *
“Kelms”: An additional 51b. of top-
hamper doesn’t seem much compared
with the weight of a frigate (B. 14/7/’4B),
but sometimes slight miscalculations can
make great differences. Take the case
of the metallic band with which a nation
of scientists decided to encircle the globe
at the equator. When completed the
band was found to be 6.2832 inches
too long. It was essential for the purpose
that the band remain that length and
that it should not overlap, so the scientists
decided to pack between the band and
the earth. The amount of packing neces-
sary was lin. thick around the entire
globe. Seems wrong, until you remember
that the circumference of a circle is
diameter x 3.1416, and that, even on a
diameter of several thousand miles, an
addition of 2in. makes a difference of
6.2832 in.
STARLING IN WINTER.
There’s silence where we heard the cuckoo call,
And swish of swallows’ wings,
But cold stills not the starling’s song;
He louder, sweeter sings.
His pulsing throat beneath his ragged beard
With unsung music swells,
Srrip! srrip! between soft sighs
Each silver bubble wells.
Upon his jewelled breast the cold light leaps
To flames of living green,
And where they run the glossy black
Is burnished with their sheen.
Through wind and rain and whispering flakes
of snow
He brings, to charm and cheer,
A rill of color for my eye,
And music for my ear.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Copper Deficiency.
“Agric”: At a field day
organised by the Tara branch
of the Selectors’ Association,
George Moule, Queensland
sheep- and wool-expert, was
able to show a local fleece which
in its early growth gave clear
indications of copper deficiency,
being broad in the crimp and
characterless, but two-thirds of
the way down there was a
marked change, the wool being
of good character and sound,
the result of the owner having
drenched with copper, in the
form of bluestone, as a correc-
tive to the trace-element defi-
ciency which had been diag-
nosed. Moule advised three
methods of administering cop-
per; (1) to drench with large
quantities of bluestone—a dose
of 81b. to 101 b. bluestone to
1000 sheep three to four times a
year, to build up a store of cop-
per in thft liver ; it was important
that ewes should receive a
copper drench in the third or
fourth month of pregnancy ; (2)
to administer copper sulphate in
the form cf licks, mixed with
salt, care being taken that the
quantity did not exceed ilb.
copper sulphate per 1000 sheep
per week; there was danger of
copper poisoning if more than
this dose was given; (3) ad-
ministering copper in water, this
method being governed by the
analysis of the water and type
of watering place ; it could be
used only in troughs where it
was possible to maintain an
even quantity of copper.
Top-dressing, in an effort to
overcome copper deficiency, was
still in its experimental stage <in
Queensland, Moule said, but
success had been achieved with
41b. to 51b. of copper sulphate
to the acre. Some property-
owners in n.-w. Queensland —
where the problem of applying
copper was made difficult by un-
suitable water and large stock
numbers—intend to experiment
with dusting from the air. South
Australian experiments had
shown that pastures top-dressed
with copper were still good after
10 years.
Noogoora Burr Control.
“Atlanta”: There seems to be
hope in the new hormone weed-
killers. Best results come from
spraying young plants and seed-
lings. The best time to treat
Noogoora burr is when it is one
to two feet high.
Ordinary sheep-jetting plants
have been used with 105 ft. of
hose .which provided 1501 b. pres-
sure to the square inch. How-
ever, use of two nozzles on a
T-extension will reduce spraying
time by 45 p.c. and cost by 25
p.c., while no more solution is
used. Spraying should be done
before 10 a.m, or after 4 p.m.,
and the foliage must be
thoroughly wet. Hot, dry
weather is not conducive to best
results.
Burr treated with hormone
solutions generally does not die
for 10 to 14 days. Minimum
killing strength is a 1 p.c. solu-
tion, and weak mixtures are
recommended. Moderately-dense
to dense burr requires from 50
to 150 gallons of solution, aver-
age 80. Average spraying time
is 98 minutes per acre, and five
hours’ spraying a day could rea-
sonably be expected. This is
equivalent to treating three acres
continuously on moderately-
heavy to heavy burr.
On present retail price of the
hormones, allowing ' wages of
two men at 3s. an' hour each
and treating an average of three
acres a day with the average 80
gallons of 1 per cent, solution,
cost is 355. per acre. On heavy
burr it may rise to 525. 6d., but
spraying cost is much below
that of pulling or hoeing, and
two men spraying do as much
in one day as they do by pulling
in seven or eight days. The ex-
penditure is negligible when it is
recalled that burr loss in wool
from heavily - infested areas,
such as the Hughenden-Clon-
curry districts, can be put as
high as 6d, to Bd. per pound.
The Horse’s Foot.
“Sarina”: As soon as a horse
shows signs of lameness get him
out of manure-contaminated
yards into a clean paddock.
Clean the foot, and you should
see what is amiss. Usually it is
a bruise, or a cut, or thrush.
Whatever the cause, it’s essen-
tial that the foot be kept free
of dirt to guard against lockjaw.
Wash the foot with antiseptics
and follow up with a bath in
bluestone water —the modern
treatment for cut or bruised feet.
Thrush is a disease caused by
dirty quarters; the hoof dis-
charges an evil-smelling yellow
matter, and is very sore. Cut
away the diseased parts gradu-
ally with a sharp knife. Any-
thing that will have a drying
astringent effect, such as slaked
lime, the bluestone solution, sub-
chloride of mercury, etc., may
be used as a remedy for thrush.
But it’s no use curing thrush if
the cause is not remedied. The
yards must be cleaned, drained
and sprinkled with lime to stop
recurrence.
Winter Feeding.
“C.A.A.”: To avoid losses
from milk-fever and its compli-
cations, grass-staggers and aci-
dosis, bring cows through the
winter on a gradually rising
plane of nutrition. A week
before calving place them in a
fairly bare, well-sheltered pad-
dock and feed them all the hay
they will eat. Keep them on this
ration for three or four days.
After calving continue the sup-
plementary hay feeding until
spring growth matures to four or
five inches high. Lush, imma-
“ Strawb’d be dead pleased to know she's still useful .”
ture grass is insufficient to
maintain cows in good bodily
condition and keep up produc-
tion. Where hay is scarce a ilb.
of molasses daily will help to
increase the food intake and so
reduce probable losses.
Hay and Silage.
“Mr.”; Shut up the paddock
to be cut some weeks before-
hand. Aim to make rather more
than the stock are expected to
eat over the lean period. Two
tons of hay or five to eight tons
of silage per dairy cow per year
is a safe figure ; half this for a
beef* animal and 2cwt, of hay
or scwt. to Bcwt. of silage per
sheep. In a normal year these
quantities will exceed require-
ments, but they’ll enable reserves
to be built up for drought years.
In a dry year good fodder is at
a premium, and surplus hay and
some forms of silage can be sold
at good prices.
Both have a place in modern
farming, but hay is the more
commonly conserved. It requires
less labor to make and feed out,
and can be readily transported
and marketed. Silage has its
advantages. Weed growth and
crops like maize and sorghums,
which do not make good hay,
can be satisfactorily ensiled;
silage is les§ affected by wet
weather at harvesting and is fire-
proof.
Well-made hay and silage are
equally nutritious, and losses of
nutrients during conservation
are about the same with each.
Rats and mice rarely attack
either. For hay the best time to
cut is just as the pollen sacs or
anthers emerge from the flowers
of the principal species in the
pasture, or slightly later if the
weather isn’t suitable for curing.
Silage is best cut a little earlier,
which should allow the hay-
cutting to follow in its turn.
Turkeys.
“Myrrhee”: Feeding is prac-
tically the same as for fowls.
As with chickens, poults don’t
need any feed in the first 36 to
48 hours. Start them off with a
good chick mixture in a dry
mash always available in hop-
pers, with a wet mash (crumbly
texture) twice a day for the first
three weeks; then feed one wet
mash a day, continuing the dry
mash. Green feed, chopped
finely, can be added. In fine
weather allow them on free
range, but when it’s wet keep
them under shelter; they’re sus-
ceptible to damp.
As they grow, feed a little
cracked wheat in the evenings,
and at six weeks whole wheat or
oats. Well-grown birds on free
range will gather enough insects
and grass-seeds to permit elimi-
nation of the mash, but the
evening grain meal should be
continued to encourage them to
return to roost. Resume the
morning feed three or four
weeks before marketing.
Weights of Steel.
“Radian”: Steel plate and
bar, usually priced by weight,
can prove confusing when work-
mg out the cost of necessary
material. It is handy to re-
member that a square foot of
steel plate, iin. thick, weighs
5. lib. From this basis it is pos-
sible to work out the approxi-
mate weight of any section of
flat bar. For instance, a fool
length of 6in. x jin., 4in. x fin..
Sin. x iin. or 2in. x |in. each
contain the same volume as one
square foot of iin. plate and
weigh the same, 5.11 b.
The Rabbit Pest.
“Dusty Gully”: Trapping as
a means of destroying them is
hopeless; five per cent, may be
caught in a burst of trapping;
the rest leg it for the horizon.
They’ll be back shortly, but
trap-shy, which is why profes-
sional trappers keep on the move
for fresh ground. Some good
kills are made with poison trails
at suitable times, practically the
only successful way of checking
rabbits on some classes of land.
Digging-out is slow and expen-
sive ; fumigating, properly done,
is the best.
In good times rabbits appear
as from nowhere and breed
rapidly, taking a heavy toll of
the choicest grazing and crops
and reducing the productivity of
a property considerably Their
skin and carcass value is only
a fraction of what could be pro-
duced in their place. In dry
times the damage to grass-roots
is enormous.
Professional rabbiters aren’t
concerned with ridding the
country of rabbits, nor are land-
holders, who regard rabbitskins
as part of their annual harvest.
Most farmers, believing there’ll
always be some rabbits, any-
way, are bent on seeing that they
don’t get to plague proportions
on their land, preferring to con-
centrate on them when skins are
at their best. I wouldn’t argue
with that policy before some
really effective means of whole-
sale extermination is discovered
—there should be a big effort in
that direction, discarding the
notion that the rabbit “industry”
is worth preserving. It isn’t.
“Kneepad”; Every property
in this Victorian district has its
regular trapper, and there is no
such thing as taking the cream
off the paddocks and then mov-
ing on to the next (B. 7/7/’4B),
for the very simple reason that
there is nowhere else to go. The
method employed here is to be-
gin operations on the pads and
to follow them to the burrows
after a couple of nights.
This has the effect of driving
bunny underground, where you
know where he is, although he
may stay there two or three
nights before venturing out to be
trapped at the burrow opening.
Burrowers are then filled in
tightly, and after the paddock

HUNTER—NEXT-OF-KIN SOUGHT.
GEORGE WINFORD HUNTER, a child of
Alexander Hunter and Elizabeth Hunter
(maiden surname Bell), was bom at Red
Gully in the State of Victoria on the 3rd
day of October 1869 and is believed to
have spent some years in Western Aus-
tralia. If the said George Winford Hunter
survived his niece, Jean Lydia Norman
Hunter, late of 8 Alicia Street, Hampton,
in the State of Victoria, Spinster, de-
ceased, who died in the month of June,
1943, he would have been entitled to
a share of her estate which is being ad-
ministered by the Public Trustee for Vic-
toria. NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN
that unless the said Public Trustee of
412 Collins Street Melbourne in the State
of Victoria receives on or before the
Fifteenth day of October 1948 a claim to
share in the said estate from the said
George Winford Hunter or from his legal
personal representative or from some per-
son claiming through the said George
Winford Hunter the said Public Trustee
will distribute the said estate upon the
footing that the said George Winford
Hunter predeceased the said Jean Lydia
Norman Hunter deceased. —0. J.

has been worked-over it is im-
mediately worked again. Trap-
ping of burrows without first
setting on the pads has the effect
of scattering rabbits everywhere,
apart from the fact that only
one is caught at each hole. Some
professional trappers can effec-
tively clean the burrows out be-
fore reaching them by follow-
ing the pads a few yards at a
time, perhaps greatly increasing
the distance of the last “shift”
and using grass to camouflage
the traps.
Shortage of netting is the
major problem at present,
especially where the trapper re-
ceives no wages and is compelled
to cease operations to follow
shearing or “get his name on a
pitchfork.”
The skin-market reports read
well to those who do not know
the “catch.” Recently I sent a
consignment of 700 skins to be
sold in Melbourne and received
a top price of 12s. 6d. a pound
—the catch being that this price
was for only one pound ; or for
one skin out of every 100 or
thereabouts, and this for a dis-
trict noted for high-grade skins.
Others of my consignment
ranged down to 2s. ,per pound.
Baling Sheepskins.
“Horseless Horseman”: Sheep-
skins should be bale-pressed.
Skins bundled loosely are apt
to collect dust and become
perished and torn in transit. Be-
fore pressing, lay two wooden
chocks in the bottom-box, fore
and aft with the door of the
woolpress. These are necessary
later to permit the passing of
wire-fastenings underneath the
three Sin.'by lin. battens which
are placed on top of the chocks
and form the bottom of the
pressed bale.
Next fold skins in half, then
in half again before placing one
in each corner of the box and so
on around. When you have
3001 b. to 3501 b. weight, put
down the spear. Haul it up again
and remove the top-box.
Three more battens are wanted
across the top of the bale, and
then two more chocks between
them and the spear before the
bale is finally put down the re-
quired length. Secure bale with
two lengths of doubled galvan-
ised-wire, Yankee-twitched. If
you have more than a bale,
grade the skins beforehand ac-
cording to staple.
Hints for the Farm.
“J.J.H.”: Sometimes it hap-
pens that a calf will keep break-
ing through to its mother after
it has been weaned. One of the
best methods for preventing this
is to couple the calf to another
calf a little larger. It soon learns
to stay with the other calves,
and can usually be let go in a
week or 10 days’ time. If no
other calf is available, fasten a
small pole about 4ft. long to a
strap around its neck by a dog-
chain, The calf drags this and
soon learns that it cannot get
through a fence.
“Billjim”: Wind - machines
are valuable, though costly, for
preventing frosts. They rely on
mixing of warmer air drawn
from the upper parts of the in-
version layer with the cold air
at ground level. Although capi-
tal expenditure is high, involv-
ing airscrews operated by high-
powered motors, labor costs are
negligible, and one machine will
protect about five acres. Dis-
posal aircraft engines have been
used with success.
“Wilco”: Worst error the
farm-gardener can m'ake is to
leave the remains of his crop
still in the ground. As soon as
any crop has served its purpose
it should be turned in or
burned, and this applies especi-
ally to tomatoes, sweet pota-
toes, beans and the various‘other
“vegies” that will keep struggling
on for months. The point is that
the spraying or dusting of vege-
table plants ceases when the
“vegies” are going off, and on
the uncared-for plants insect
pests feed and breed as they
please. The gardener has to
cope with them the following
season.
“Sundowner”: An electric
fence can be used with advan-
tage in the efficient grazing of
winter-saved grass. Move the
fence across the paddock on the
break system in the same manner
as a sheepfarmer moves a net-
ting fence in feeding-off breaks
of root and other fodder crops.
“Nubis”: When feeding
boiled rabbits to fowls (B.
7/7/’4B) make sure the turkeys
don’t get any, as their digestive
system can’t cope with the food.
A friend lost 40 birds last year
this way.
“N.”: Hardening of cup-
rubbers, with consequent block-
ages in small orifices in milking-
machines, is often caused by the
presence of lime in some steri-
lising agents. To avoid, mix at
least 30 minutes before use, then
pour off the clear liquid con-
taining the chlorine from the
lime that is left.
This W.A. district
is one in which bloat occurs
very frequently, and I have had
40 years’ experience with it. The
best remedy, and the quickest,
safest and , most harmless, is
Stockholm tar. About two tea-
spoonfuls rubbed on the cow’s
tongue with a flat stick will not
injure her, and will do the trick
in less time than the trocar or
knife. She will be normal again
in no time. I have never had
to give a second dose.
“Mozzer”: Tools are prone to
rust during winter, especially
gardening tools. After using,
clean and wipe them down with
an oily rag before putting them
away. If the damage is already
done, mix one part glycerine, two
parts oxalic acid, two parts
phosphoric acid and five parts
very fine sand. Make it into a
paste and cover the implements
with it. Then stand them in a
warm place for 45 minutes and
wash the mixture off. The shiny
result will surprise you.

Remarks in Season.
I huddle close beside my smoky
grate
And shaking at the knees I curse
my fate
To be deprived of radiator
power
And gas-fires in this chill be-
nighted hour.
While winds like banshees moan
amongst the gums
And seek the cracks of houses in
the slums.
Yet while I croich despairingly
and brood
One saving factor brightens up
my mood —
The swing from “Labor” in
each by-election
Cheers up my heart and banishes
dejection,
And then I laugh and say : “Ah,
bitter wind,
If winter comes can Ming be far
behind !”
BERT.
Among the 1948-season
Roses.
Doctor Herbert Verb : This
pink sport from Barton is very
rarely seen in Australia these
days. It was received most en-
thusiastically abroad a few years
ago, but is now regarded very
poorly overseas, following tests to
which it has been subjected by
experts. Of long rambling habit,
it is purely an exhibition variety.
Raised mostly from cuttings
(press), it doesn’t stand up well
to heat, especially inside the
House. Its cultivation, it has
been estimated, has cost Aus-
tralia tens of thousands of
dollars to date, with the end not
yet in sight—easily the most ex-
pensive variety yet raised in this
country.' Peculiar feature is that
it gives out not blooms, but
bloomers.
Ben C.: Another pink, some-
what deeper than Doctor Her-
bert Vere, and with a broad yel-
low streak. Does well enough
in the Bathurst district of
N.S.W., where it was raised
(though inclined to be nipped by
local frosts in the municipality),
but is a rank failure elsewhere.
Wilts Very badly when placed in
close proximity to any of the
reds.
Taxslug : This remarkably
vigorous grower needs constant
and drastic pruning, but habit in
Australia has been to neglect
this aspect, with the result that it
is inclined to get out of hand,
and when given too much
socialistic fertiliser will strangle
everything else in the garden.
Introduced originally as a
miniature species, the newest
variety is a wonderfully healthy
specimen and a voracious
feeder. Its raiser is in grave
danger of being eventually
strangled by it should he neglect
to keep it within bounds.
Bureaucrat ; Another variety
which attains to phenomenal
growth in a remarkably short
“If you feel you MUST have it well sell the house and get
a little flat”
time. Possesses a very strong
tea scent, particularly around
11 a.m. and 3.30 p.m. Inclined
to parasitical habits, and will
branch out in all directions ; if
left to its own growth it will
crowd everything else out. Never
been known to bloonrbeyond the
embryo bud stage, but hopes
that it will eventually produce
something worth the trouble of
keeping it well fed have been
held for years.
Deadhead : A sport from
Bureaucrat possessing all the
parasitical characteristics of the
parent variety. Also an enor-
mous feeder. Expert opinion is
that this type will never pay.
Likes to be kept in a well-
sheltered position.
Goalie: Deep crimson, and
on very rare occasions almost
black, this variety is the
thorniest known. Doesn’t stand
up well to regular picking. Likes
to have its roots well into red
clay, and does no good when put
where it i§ inclined to be on the
dark side. Many experts believe
this variety could be greatly
improved if it were kept in order
and subjected to some pruning
at the top.
Press Beachgirl : Very
highly decorative, this type
usually responds well to per-
sistent cultivation. Objects
strongly to too much water, but
thrives where conditions are
sandy. In the early summer it
blooms profusely, with color
varying from faint pink to fiery
red, often fading to white again.
Later in the season the color
may change to copper, and at
times it may even be brazen.
Photographs yvell usually,
though the chief objection is
that too often it has a hard
look. Improves under soft arti-
ficial light against a selected
background. Often described
as a good sort.
Warfee: A sport from Red
Radiance and one of the slowest-
moving of any. Does no good
at all when conditions are
slightly damp, and will even
shrivel when anything that looks
like a rain-cloud appears on the
horizon. Also droops badly after
being half an hour in the hot
sun, requiring plenty of liquid
stimulant. Has a pronounced
leaning habit. Definitely will
not run.
Fixer: A sport from Liaison.
One specimen of the garden
variety recently put in a jug
aroused adverse comment from
one good Judge because of
its peculiarly twisted growth.
Sometimes runs to wood.
Often of parasitical habit, with
an overpowering perfume. Gen-
erally does well in a shady
position.
Platitude; Not a novelty
variety. It opens up very
quickly inside the House,
especially when hot air is freely
circulating. Most prolific species
extant, doing particularly well
in Canberra and Sydney. Though
a hardy perennial, it fades badly
after the first bloom.
McGirr Housing : This
variety, which was boosted last
year throughout N.S.W. as being
one of great promise, has proved
the worst failure turned out in
that State for years. A hybrid
related to the Doctor Herbert
Vere, it has developed into a
thing of spindly growth, and
is subject to die-back, black-
spot, red-mite, mildew, blight
and a host of other diseases.
Even its raiser now holds out
little hope that it will come
good.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4j|d. per line; all others 2£d. per line.
Local Government
Brisbane isn’t the only place that has
found amalgamation of municipalities
not the blessing claimed by its advocates
(B. 14/7/’4B). Although the Blue
Mountains City Council (N.S.W.) is only
a recent creation, there is already such
dissatisfaction with its functioning that
the council itself, with only three dis-
sentients, has recommended that the area
be divided into at least two municipalities.
Four local-governing bodies formerly
covered its territory.
Here in effect is Alderman Frank
Walford’s summing-up of the situation:
There has been an alarming increase in
overhead. As regards aldermen, “the old
intimate touch” has gone. The inevitable
result has been enforced reliance on the
reports of officers. We had to be guided
by their recommendations and vote in the
dark.
A third point was a tremendous inroad
on the time of aldermen. A normal busi-
ness paper comprised 70 pages of closely-
typed foolscap. The number has run to
100 pages. One of these voluminous busi-
ness-sheets represents just two weeks’
accumulation of work.
The whole thing is unwieldy, inefficient
and a negation of “local” government.. Our
area stretches longitudinally for 80 miles
with an area of 540 square miles. It con-
sists of four major towns and a string of
rural hamlets all separated by virgin bush.
The powers-that-be, with sardonic irony,
have dubbed this miscellaneous array of
towns, villages and bush a city.
Gosford Shire Council (N.S.W.),
created by the amalgamation of Woy
Woy, Gosford and part of Erina Shire,
has also resolved:
That the Minister of Local Government
be informed that it is the opinion of this
council that Woy Woy district be re-
constituted as a local-governing area.
—Castlereagh (N.S.W.).
Outback Roads
Country roads (B. 28/7/’4B) will get
worse yet, and there is no hope of bitu-
men, gravel or high-level bridges while
the present Federal Government con-
tinues to stack £ll million of the petrol-
tax into general revenue each year. In
most country areas rates are only a small
part of revenue, local councils having to
rely on grants from their* State roads
departments and money from Federal
grants.
For instance, two small grants have
been given to S.A. and Westralia —about
£lOOO each—towards the east-west road,
which is 1800 miles long. How far will
£2OOO go on that road?
The evil does not stop at lack of money
for new roads. Millions of pounds are
invested in present roads,' and if these
are not properly maintained much of that
money will disappear. As in many other
things' SA.’s Premier Playford has the
right approach—every penny of State
motor-revenue goes to the roads. But
of the £120,000 a month taken from S.A.
in petrol-tax only £40,000 comes back in
road grants.— -Camsa (S.A.).
The Golden Valley
The Tweed Valley, one of Australia’s
richest rural areas, is coming to the
parting of the ways. Its leaders, as a
rule preoccupied with local matters, will
soon have to do some solid political
thinking and clearly define their attitude
to the new-State movement.
The Tweed has always regarded the
movement with indifference. It was
among the very few northern N. S. Wales
areas not represented at the Armidale
conference, and Tweed Shire Council
has voted against sending even an
observer to the next convention.
One reason for the Tweed’s voluntary
isolation from the general political trend
is its proximity to Brisbane, only 50
miles away as the crow flies and 86 by
road from Murwillumbah, the district’s
main centre. Within easy shopping dis-
tance, Brisbane is the “Big City” to the
Tweed, and it has been argued that if
ever Sydney control ended the valley
would turn naturally to the Queensland
capital. That would have advantages, but
it wouldn’t help decentralisation.
But the main explanation of the dis-
trict’s aloofness is that it is quite satis-
fied with itself and its present position.
It has reason to be. Its 20,000 people
spread over the valley’s 500 square miles
represent, at a density of 40 per square
mile, one of the finest examples of rural
close-settlement in Australia. The fer-
tility of the hill-encircled valley, domi-
nated by Mt. Warning, is marvellous. It
will grow any tropical crop, and a good
many temperate ones. Its beauty is equal
to anything in the Commonwealth and it
has a genial sub-tropical climate.
In a district so favored by Nature, it
has been easy, with work, to make
money, and big money has been made,
even by little men. Before the banana
market cracked, a man with 10 bearing
acres might make over £lOOO a year.
Total value of the valley’s produce in
1947 was about £2| millions. Dairy-
ing, bananas and sugar headed the list,
but timber, fish, maize, pineapples and
small crops, including strawberries, also
brought in big returns. A considerable
tourist traffic helped to swell the district’s
income. A veritable Golden Valley.
It is not unnatural that its people should
want to leave what seems to be well-
enough alone. But they overlook the
darker side of the picture. Erosion in
all hill areas is on the increase. The
river is silting up. Floods are becoming
more frequent. The town, with six big
hotels and a remarkably handsome and
expensive movie-house, has no sewerage
system, and a paddock for a park. Flood-
prevention schemes remain schemes.
Remembering that Big-City government
has done little to prevent or remedy
these things, Tweed Councillors may
eventually reconsider their “closed-door”
attitude to the decentralisation pioneers.
‘No. no —not 'obey within reason—just 'obey'! ”
It may be too late when the new State
has actually been established. The shires
and municipalities which have done the
spadework and found the money may not
be ready to welcome a fence-sitter, even
a wealthy one, with open arms.
The Golden Valley is, in that respect,
in the same position as other “wait-and-
see” northern local-governing areas.
Its leaders, like theirs, have in the past
shown themselves practical and possessed
of strong commonsense. But they will
have to show vision as well.—K. A. S.
(N.S.W.).
Stung Both Ways
The Secretary for External Territories,
I. R. Halligan, speaking to the United
Nations Assembly in support of Aus-
tralia’s proposed annexation of the
former Mandated Territory of New
Guinea, said “It is a country of vast
wealth and resources.”
It certainly is, asTar as Commonwealth
revenue is concerned. New Guinea resi-
dents pay export levy on such ingeniously
contrived items as the wheat content of
macaroni, cotton content of mops and
raincoats, tallow content of soap and
margarine and, of course, the immense
levy on flour which enables us to buy a
21b. loaf of bread for 2s.—the Australian
price is about Bd. We also pay for such
things as the leather subsidy on footwear.
On top of all that, there is enough left
over for us to pay 11 per cent, import
duty on all items entering the country. —
Lim-Limbu (N.G.),
The P.M.G.
Slackness noted in the P.M.G.’s De-
partment is yet another symptom
of the prevailing social disease. We have
surrendered to the delusion that we need
not work for what we want, that a high
standard of living can be achieved and
retained by less and less work for more
and more pay. The Postal Department is
a public service, and service—giving one’s
time, thought and energy ungrudgingly to
doing something for others —is in the dis-
card. Postal employees see no reason why
they too should not enjoy a good time,
doing just enough work to get past the
boss.

from Sydney arrives soon after 7 a'.m.
Once, the mail was all sorted and in the
private boxes by 8.3 O; today sorting is
rarely more than half completed by
9 a.m,, to the inconvenience of business
houses. Once the outward mail closed at
6 p.m., then at 5.30, now at 5, again at
some inconvenience to business-people.
The old meticulous care and accuracy
of the postal service make the present
slackness all the more serious, because
commercial practice has been built up on
absolute faith in the mails. Contractual
obligations are frequently deemed to have
been discharged by the mere act of posting
a remittance or document —once delivered
into the care of the post-office they are
(or were) as good as in the hands of the
addressee.
The proportion of registered mail must
have increased enormously in recent
years. At one time we never registered an
article unless it was really valuable;
today you register any darned little packet
if you want to make reasonably sure of
its arrival. — Hist (N.S.W.).
In 15 years of letter-handling I’ve
never seen so many complaints on the
postmaster’s table. There were com-
plaints in the old days, but they were
vigorously investigated and, where pos-
sible, mistakes were rectified. The de-
partment prided itself on its efficiency,
and a letter posted was, in 99.9 cases in
a 100, safely delivered.
Today the P.M.G. can’t find enough
men to take over the enormously in-
creased work of letter-handling, -sorting,
-dispatch and -delivery. The main reason,
apart from the general shortage of labor,
is the wages. Compared with wages ob-
taining in private industry, those offered
by the P.M.G., particularly in the junior
grades, are not in the event. The £6 10s.
a week offered to a married man with one
child —and payable fortnightly—isn’t
nearly enough to attract men of the right
stamp and intelligence to handle mail.
The job calls for a reasonable intelligence
and education, and for a tolerant attitude
towards the public. It requires, further,
an almost personal interest in the fate
of letters.
The P.M.G. has other worries.
Registered mails and air - mails have
grown, and districts which, 20 years ago,
were mainly scrub and ti-tree are now
thriving industrial areas. My own district
is not only an expanding residential and
industrial centre, but also has a Housing
Commission centre of a few thousand
souls tacked on to its delivery area. There
has been no proportionate increase of
staff and space to handle the extra mails.
Something will be done eventually, but
at present vexatious delays in inefficiency
are unavoidable.
In all, there are many grounds for
complaint, but there is also some evidence
in favor of the P.M.G. at any Dead
Letter office. In one day’s haul there is
any amount of proof of the almost in-
cx edible stupidity and carelessness of
letter-writers in general, and office-typists
in particular. I sent back 65 samples to-
day.—Mail-call (N.S.W.).
The P.M.G.’s troubles are similar to
those experienced by other large organisa-
tions. We have a vastly increased number
of temporary employees and casuals who
are not as careful or “work-proud” as the
pre-war permanents. Many permanents
also are sliding into a slacker attitude
because they know jobs are many and
men are scarce.
Before the war our staff consisted
mainly of permanents, under strict and
constant surveillance and subject to fines
or reprimands when errors were made.
The attraction of a safe permanent Gov-
ernment job was strong enough to keep
us on our toes. Personal records were
kept and a man’s future promotion largely
depended on them. Records are still kept,
but there has been a considerable easing
of conditions to induce Employees to stay.
I’d like to see the halfpenny surcharge
go—l am a counter-officer —but the in-
creased wages bill and expansion of
various communication equipment will
absorb all the extra income. Many other
public utilities have increased their
charges by a bigger percentage. — Postal
Clerk (S.A.).
Because of shipping strikes, slow turn-
rounds and thefts of goods in transit,
many Tasmanian shopkeepers have
switched over to the post for lighter and
more urgent goods. Apart from the addi-
tional cost this method is far from satis-
factory. It is common for a Sydney or
Melbourne wholesaler to post, say, a
dozen packages at a given time, and for
half of them to arrive one day and the
balance at an interval of anything from
three to seven days.
Nor is it uncommon to receive packages
damaged by water, but when a complaint
is made to postal officials at our end they
regret their inability to do anything about
it, — Obelist (Tas.),
The Homeless
All over my part of N.S.W., when I
go on a walkabout, I see carpenters and
bricklayers building churches, additions
to churches, halls, additions to halls, a
technical college or two, hotels and addi- ■
tions to hotels, extra verandahs, garages,
public buildings for the “Government”
and other edifices.
When I return home I find the same
old complaints—houses of six rooms with
six families living in them, one in each
room, while pubs, boarding-houses and
flats are overcrowded to bursting. Most
of the population is groaning with the
pains of separated families, of children
being reared in slum conditions in ex-
Army huts or of exorbitant rents for the
privilege of “living” in sub-standard
houses.
In one boarding-house of a normal
three bedrooms there were 16 adults
accommodated by turning the verandahs
into cells and squeezing a two-bunk cara-
van into the backyard. In one room
there were two men and a boy sleeping
end-for-end in one double bed. And
people were being turned away at the
door by the proprietor every day.
Apparently our “controllers” aren’t
fit to be entrusted with a dog-licence or
they would stop all building activity ex-
cept housing until sufficient homes have
been built, especially for the Young
Diggers who were promised mansions
with refrigerators, wireless-sets and
built-in furniture if they would only save
the country from the Japs and the
Jerries. —2315 (N.S.W.).
Red Cedar
N. S. Wales afforestation authorities
are missing a good bet when they fail to
include red cedar in their lists for plant-
ing.
It is one of the most useful, ornamental
and scarce of our indigenous trees. The
towns of the North Coast and Tablelands
were first settled by red-cedar getters who
practically cleared it out. Today it doesri’t
exist in commercial quantities.
Now that red cedar is among the
antiques it is more sought after than ever
—fumiture-shops all over the State are
turned over by shrewd buyers, and when
an auctioneer wants to draw big crowds
and big money he has only to advertise
a few pieces of red cedar.
So far as I know only one local-govern-
ment body interested in tree-planting has
even mentioned red cedar, and official
afforesters seem to have forgotten its
existence and value. — Greenhide Bob
(N.S.W.).
More Shush, Please
The latest stupid move by Australian
Minister for Air Drakeford was his vain
effort to stop publicity on a recent his-
toric flight of an R.A.A.F. Catalina from
Cambridge, Tasmania, to the Australian
Antarctic Expedition base on Macquarie
Island, a round-trip of 2004 miles.
Immediately R.A.A.F. public-rela-
tions officers heard of the proposed trip
they collected information for a good
story, and it was good because no air-
craft had ever alighted before on those
rough waters. Refuelling was impossible
on the island, and the flying-boat had to
take sufficient fuel for the full trip.
When the story was submitted to the
Air Board secretary it was “scrubbed”
under Ministerial instructions, because the
trip would use up petrol which would
cost dollars and “the public should not
know that.”
The whole thing became a joke with
Melbourne journalists, many of whom
were R.A.A.F. officers during the war
and were able to get the facts with little
trouble, despite Mr. Drakeford’s silence.
Even when the story did appear Mr.
Drakeford was as silent as ever.
If “Labor” Ministers continue this air
of intrigue, they are only making it
harder for themselves when the election
comes round. — Waddlin’ Willie (Vic.).

OnE of the ambitions of every housewife is to reign
over a modern all-steel kitchen. It is so nice to come
home to something to be proud of and pleasant to
work in.
Nothing contributes more to contented living than
today’s ideal kitchen. Here is a domain where steel’s
strength, versatility and pleasing appearance is at once
apparent. In the hands of industry steel has brought to
reality the plans of architects and engineers for greater
kitchen effectiveness and beauty.
Yes, today’s dream kitchens with their stainless steel
sinks, electric and gas cooking ranges, trouble-free
hot water services, steel-built freezers and refrigerators,
and space-saving steel storage cabinets are far removed
from the days of the hand-turned cooking spit and the
iron pot on the hob.
The use of steel in kitchen furnishings and equipment
provides evidence of the fact that steel can do more jobs
better than any other material.
B.H.P. steel—product of the fusion in the furnaces
at the Newcastle Steel Works of South Australian iron
ore and limestone and New South Wales coal—plays its
part in enabling the Australian housewife to enjoy the
benefits of modern kitchen design.
