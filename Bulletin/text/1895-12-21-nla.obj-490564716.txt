The Melbourne Argus says:—“There is hope for the
Australian Poet when a volume of verse qoes into its
third edition within six weeks of its first publication, and
zreat encouragement is to be extracted from the fact
that tlie success of the book is entirely justified by the
quality of its contents.”
Mr. Bruntos STEfiiKNs says:—-“The more frequently'
they are re-read the better they seem to be.' I cannot
agree with the critics who say that they are the best
busii ballads since Gordon. I think they are quite on a
level with Gordon’s, though, of course, each of the two
writers lias his own special merits. . . . The best
book published in Australia for very many years.”

“ Degeneration. ”
Nordau’s newest work lias hitherto had no salts
in Australia, for at sight of a publisher demand-
ing a guinea for a volume democratic pockets shut
like an oyster. As the first volume in Heine-
mann’s new Empire Library (ss. Od. posted),
“Degeneration” will get more attention. Two
others of Nordau’s works, “Conventional Lies”
and “Paradoxes,” are to follow it in the same
series ; but these have already become familiar in
the cheap American edition. Not so well known
are Masson's “ Napoleon and the Fair Sex,”
or Walisze.wski’s account of that marvel among
marvellous women—Catherine IT. of Russia.
These spicy redactions of old memoirs have a tang
and gusto which one rarely meets in contemporary
“ cheap literature,” and the success of the reprints
should be signal.
‘' Degeneration ” is in many ways a remarkable
work remarkable for its vigor, its knowledge,
the interest of its theories and the ingenuity with
which they are advocated. Nordau dedicates his
book to Lombroso, who traced the relations
between civilisation’s neurosis and civilisation’s
Crime and insanity. It is Nordau’s own aim to
collect arid classify the effects of nervous degenera-
tion in modem art and literature.
Ho considers the leading schools —mystic, egois-
tic realistic---argues for their degeneracy, and
ill nitrates his arguments by a detailed criticism of
their chief apostles. This survey takes up the
greater part of the-well-packed book. It is per-
formed with great skill, but the author’s fecundity
frequently embarrasses, and he loses lucidity in
the whirl of uncontrollable language. Hence an
apt and well-sustained accusation that he himself
is a graphomaniac—one of the very degenerates
'whom he denounces !
There is a prologue of causes, and 'epilogue of
consequences—a discussion of the manner in which
“ degeneration ” has arrived and the way in
which it will depart—for of its departure through
the gate of the “survival of the fittest” Nordau
is assured.
The text for the author’s whole sermon is Guerin-
sen’s apothegm ; “Genius is a disease of the
nerves” (though, says Nordau, “ science does not
assert that every genius is a lunatic”). The
sermon itself is an encyclopaedia of dissertations
upon physiology, criminology, insanity, hypnot-
ism, literary, musical, and artistic expression—its
modes and significations, and a hundred branches
of science which Nordau cleverly connects with
his radical idea. Wagner, Zola, Ibsen, Tolstoi,
the Pre-Raphaelites, are exhaustively treated.
Nietzsche, Maeterlinck, Verlaine, Walt Whit-
man, Oscar Wilde, and a score more are
less elaborately discussed. Gleanings from
a thousand books are added to the mass—
which, it is not wonderful, leaves an impression
of amorphous crudeness. The whole is more
admirable than convincing'—it has enormous
weight and comparatively small penetrative
power. And Nordan continually strains the
interpretation of his facts. Doubtless, modern
degeneracy being given, it must and does exhibit
itself in modern art and literature. That is
almost an a priori certainty ; but, of Nordau’s
® posteriori proofs, almost as many weaken the
conclusion as enforce it. _ His judgment seems to
drift on the current of his prodigious fertility.
A passage from the explanation of the “ why-
ness ’ of degeneration
[Modern] activities, even the simplest, involve an effort
of the nervous system and a wearing of tissue. Every
line we read or write, every human face we see, every
conversation we carry on, every scene we perceive
through the window of the flying - express, sets in activity
our sensory nerves and our brain centres. Even the
lit tle shocks of railway travelling, not perceived by con-
sciousness, the perpetual noises, and the various sights in
the streets of a large town, our suspense pending the
sequel of progressing events [e.ff, the Dean case !], cost
our brains wear and tear. In the last 50 years the popu-
lation of Europe has not doubled, whereas the sum of its
labors has increased tenfold, in part even fiftyfold. Every
civilised man furnishes, at the present time, from five to
25 times as much work as v. as demanded of him half a
century ag'o.
And this, according to Nordau, will be deg’enera-
tion s outcome :
The hysteria of the present day will not last. People
will recover from their present fatigue. The feeble, the
degenerate, will perish ; the strong will adapt themselves
to the acquisitions of civilisation, or will subordinate
them to their own organic capacity. The aberrations of
art have no future. They will disappear when civilised
humanity shall have triumphed over its exhausted con-
chtion. The art of the twentieth century will connect
itself at every point with the past, but it will have anew
task to accomplish—that of introducing* a stimulatin<>'
i anetj into the uniformity of civilised life, an influence
which probably science alone will be in a position to exert,
many centuries later, over the great majority of mankind.
Few books published have held such a wealth of
ideas and facts for alert minds on the literary
scientific plane : there is dynamic suggestion and
stimulus on every page.

R.R.: “S.M. Herald, in its “Literary Gossip ”
quotes the first stanza of Rudyard Kipling’s
limes poem with the comment: “It consists of
14 verses, all in Mr. Kipling’s most characteristic
vein. This is the stanza quoted :
We’ve drunk to the Queen, God bless her,
We’ve chunk to our mothers’ land ;
We’ve drunk to our English brother
(But he does not understand) ;
We’ve drunk to the whole creation,
And the cross swings low to the dawn
Last toast, and of obligation :
We’ve drunk to the native-born !
What can be said of the acumen of a critic who
declares a stanza like this to be in the “most
characteristic vein ” of a verse-maker who, as a
rule, is an exceptionally dexterous craftsman as
regards rhythm and rhyme. The first quatrain
is distinctly poor, while the second contains
the atrocious cockney rhyme of “dawn” and
born, and a line “ Last toast, arid of obliga-
tion," so limping and unmusical that it barely
scans. The truth is that the verse is about as
feeble a one as Kipling ever wrote, and the whole
poem, rhe Native Rom, is below his record. ”
[All the same, Kipling “gets thar.” He isn’t
as academically correct as he anight be ; but look
at the swing and fire of the verse, the wonderfully
vivid epithets (despite errors), the glamor of the
imagery. Isn't this good for a man who never
saw Australia?
To the hush of the breathless morning
On the thin, tin, crackling roofs,
To the haze of the burned back-ranges
And the drum of the shoeless hoofs—
To the risk of a death by drowning,
To the risk of a death by drouth—
To the men of a million acres,
To the sons of the Golden South.
That stirs and sticks. But your side is forcibly
put by a National Observer "parodist :
We’ve drunk, too, to Rudyard Kipling,
e’ve drunk at our Kip.’s command,
We’ve drunk to this, that, and the other, ’
To more t han we understand !
We’ve drunk to the things he bids us,
To the moon and the stars and the dawn—
Last toast, and a rhyme that’s cockney—
A health to the Native-bawn !
He charged us charge our glasses
(For this pun hie charge is free !)
To some Four Mysterious Peoples,
To the islands in some sea
To the last least hr up of mud-flat,
Where none may stand or slide ; :
We did it—wc toasted each sand-bank,
For vie had no darned false pride.
Three “ hies ” to the Native-born (shtan’ up !)
We’re six tight men arow ;
We don’ wanter fi’ for the lil thinnsh we shing about—
We don’ care a cuss for the lil thingsh we shing about—
We’re more comfble here below 1
Goo ni’, good ol’ Kipple (shake hands !)
The room’sh upshide down I could a’shworn 1
All roun’ my head an’a lil chair-leg to hold it by ;
Allrounmyheadamalilshpittoontorestitin
An’ a 8.-an’-S. for the Native-born !]
G. H. Davies, of M.L. Native Department,
points out that the Maori name for the snn, “ Ra,”
is identical with the ancient Egyptian. Has any-
body ever broached the theory that the Harvard
University “ Rah I ” English “Hurrah!” are
relics .of times when our smi-worshipping
ancestors used to shout unanimously in praise of
the great God of Life and Light ?
Angus and Robertson rightly say that “Banjo’s”
book makes an admirable Christmas gift: it is the
characteristic book of Australian verse for friends
at a distance. Brunton Stephens’ praise is all
deserved.

“ Phil May’s Winter Annual ” (Is 3d) maintains

The first number of Chapman’s Story Series (2s

which recently appeared in Chapman’s Magazine.
The yarns are good, but they came decidedly

W. Pett Ridge’s “ Minor Dialogues ” (3s, 4s)
shine with real humor. They are better taken in

Agwigs—Anstey, Anthony Hope, Violet Hunt—
is more entertaining for a space. And the char-
acters are real, too —common objects of the London

entomological pins. This is a book worth buying.
Yol. VII, of “The Yellow Book” (6s. 6d.) con-
tains a great many pretty things and no parti-
cularly strong thing. The verse is cultured and
graceful and empty of inspiration; the tales are
mostly good without being very good; and the
art grows more conventional and certainly less
ugly- “The Yellow Book, ”in losing its note of
heresy and ‘ ‘ decadence, ’’ is, however, losing all
that made it remarkable. There is one strik-
ing article in Yol. Vll.—a note on books and
critics, by “ The Yellow Dwarf,” written in
the old slashing Saturday style. The essence
of it is an assault on current English methods of
book-reviewing—with an indication of the writer’s
“ better way.” He saith :
In order to criticise you must have certain endowments
—you must have a certain equipment. You must have
eyes and ears, you must have taste; you must have the
analytic faculty and the knack of nice expression ; you
must have the habit of getting at close quarters with
your thought and your emotion-you must be able to
explain wuy, for what qualities, for what defects, you
cherish Mr. Henry James (for instance), regard Mr.
Marriott Watson with expectant pleasure, dread Mr.
Anthony Hope, and flee from Miss Marie Corelli as from
the German measles. You must have knowledge—a Uni-
versity education, indeed, would do you no harm, nor an
acquaintance with the literatures of France and Russia.
You must have a tradition of culture. And, above all,
you must have leisure—for any sort of oonsklered writing
you must have leisure. Well, how many of these endow-
ments, how much of this equipment,'is vour Pressman,

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful iniuence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness m the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, theundersigned, have had occasion toobtam
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir,—l have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared. Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Bverton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of bis
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir, — I had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully. J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-

received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe, He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.

THE “MADDING’ 4 CROWD)
THE Vl f AL SPARK I i
The near approach of Xmas Day is bringing
tens of thousands to our stores from far and near,
people who have been there before, and folk who
for the first time have boon vouchsafed that wis-
dom which impels so many to steer for the Hay-
market. Our arrange cents for the special wants
of the festive season have this year been on an extra
liberal scale, and the comfort of our customers has
been ministered to, in no small degree, by recent j
improvements. Thus, as a consequence, ample ]
space, so essentially necessary to successful shop-
ping operations, is at command, while that leisurely j
inspection of purchases, only to be accomplished
in the absence of undue noise and bustle, is
afforded to all on business bent. And yet there .
are not wanting signs that before our doors close
on XMAS EVE, the capacity of
OUB IMMENSE WAREHOUSES
As well as our desire, and that of our willing
assistants, to do their level best, will be taxed to
the utmost. The position may well be likened to
that of a great national gathering upon the occa-
sion of some popular demonstration. A great
man mounts the platform to speak, and as he )
proceeds the crowd warm to his utterances. <
Cheer after cheer follows his glowing words, when
as he nears the end, and, in fervid language, sets
the nation’s course and proclaims the people’s
destiny, with one accord the masses rise and cheer
the speaker to the echo, till there is danger of
some precious words escaping ears whose owners
long to profit by them.
THE VITAL SPARK
The life-giving fire of Low Prices for the best of
everything, has set the town aflame and stirred
each Xmas buyer to come to us. Since the Xmas
trade opened in the first week of the month there
has been, day by day, a steady increase in our
trade. And so it will be. Customers will multiply,
till when Xmas Eve comes, from far and m ar,
from suburbs and city and township, from village
and mountainside, from every point of the compass
and every part of the colony, everybody, impelled
by a mighty enthusiasm and urged by ihe solemn
conviction that it’s the proper thing to do, will
have done their Xmas shopping, or be going to do
it, at our store.

Inspector-General Fosbery, as Chairman
of N.S.W. Aborigines Protection Board, expressed
himself at a recent meeting in terms of enthusi-
astic satisfaction with the results obtained by the
work of his organisation. “At one time,” he
said, “ the aborigines were to a certain extent
beyond control, but now every individual family
is under the cognisance and control of the Board.”
And then the census returns of the aboriginal
population for ’95, compiled from police informa-
tion, were read, and showed that, in Oct. last,
there were 96 full-bloods less than in the same
month of the preceding year, and 125 half-castes
more. “Now, every individual family is under
the cognisance and control of the Board.”

Hori Grey once enlisted in the ranks.
During the West Coast war the Govt, steamer on
which he was a passenger anchored early one
morning in New Plymouth roadstead, and he was
conveyed ashore in the ship’s boat. There was no
one astir on the beach except the provost-sergeant.
“Nice morning,” he remarked in his most suave
style. “Beautiful,” responded the stranger.
“ Going up town ? ” inquired the sergeant. “I
want to find the Marsland Hotel,” was the reply,
“Let me have the pleasure of showing you the
way,” said the extremely civil non-com. —who
beguiled the walk with sweeping criticisms on the
conduct of the war, and fierce denunciations of
the philo-Maori sympathies of Governor Grey.
Suddenly halting and eyeing the new-comer
from head to foot, he remarked : “ Well, you’ve
seen your best days, but you look a likely chap to
carry a rifle. Ever been drilled?” “Well, I
think I know my facings,” replied the visitor.
“Thought so,” said the sergeant, “ Well, I sup-
pose you don’t know that anybody who lands here
during martial law is liable to be compulsorily
enlisted?” “Oh, yes, I’ve heard something of
the kind,” replied Grey. “Well, then, my
friend, here’s Her Majesty’s shilling, and you
may consider yourself enlisted in the Taranaki
Militia. I’ll get the doctor to pass you by and
bye, have you sworn in, and rig you out in uni-
form.” By this time they had reached the hotel.
“Thanks, sergeant,” said the new recruit, pocket-
ing the shilling. “If you’ll just allow me to
deliver a message here I’ll be at your service.” He
whispered a message to the barman, who flew
upstairs. “Have a drink to wet your enlist-
ment,” said the sergeant. “Thank you, I never
drink before breakfast.” “I do,” said the non-
com. Two minutes later the Defence Minister,
hastily attired in a dressing-gown and smoking-
oap, rushed downstairs, and, making a low bow,
said “Good morning, your Excellency. Pray
excuse my dress ; I did not expect you so early.”
The sergeant almost choked in the act of drinking
a long beer, and when he had recovered from his
confusion he stammered out an apology. Grey
complimented him on his zeal, and afterwards
recommended him for promotion. But he kept
that shilling.

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1895.
The New Foreign-trade Fra.
On the first day of 1896 New South Wales is
to commence another epoch of partial Free-
trade, and the alleged curse of Protection—
such Protection as it was—is to begin to dis-
appear by instalments out of the land. By
that time New South Wales will have had
about four years of a more or less Protective
tariff, and before it enters upon the great,
glad era of freedom and prosperity that is to
come, it is worth while to look back on the
short-lived experiment inaugurated by the
Dibbs Government and consider its results.
The charge most persistently advanced by
the Foreign-trade party and the Foreign-
trade press is that Protection raises prices,
.and the burden of its most frequent wail is
that Protective duties are a heart-breaking
load upon the miserable “consumer.”
Therefore, the Foreign-trader’s crusade has
been carried on in the name of this allegedly
down-trodden person, and he has been called
upon incessantly to vote for the importing
interest in order to save himself from des-
truction. In most cases, too, he has done it,
for the average man in course of time
believes almost anything that is told him
often enough, and with sufficient energy,
and by dint of much iteration he really came
to imagine that the Protective period in New
South Wales had been one of high prices and
scarcity. Yet, in reality, it has been, so far
as concerns the necessaries of life, a period
of such cheapness as the province never saw
before, even in the best days of the Foreign-
trade regime, and the doleful lie that Protec-
tion always raises prices is confronted by the
fact that prices have fallen everywhere.
• • • ♦
Comparing the retail prices of 1891, the
last year of the old Foreign-trade period,
with those of 1894, the last year of Protec-
tion for which complete returns are avail-
able, Government statistician Coghlan
shows the following results : Bread fell
from 3|d. to 2|d. per loaf ; beef from 4d. to
3d. per lb. ; butter from Is. Id. to Is. ;
cheese from 9d. to Bd. ; sugar from 3|d. to
; potatoes from ss. to 4s. 6d. per cwt. ;
bacon from lOd. to 7d. ; eggs from Is. 6d. to
Is. 3d, per dozen ; oatmeal from 2|d. to 2|d.
per lb. ; salt from Id. to |d. ; soap from
B|d. to 3d. ; and starch from sd. to 4|d.
Almost all o r hese are articles on which
duties were either imposed or increased
under the Dibbs tariff, and according to all
Foreign-trade logic the prices should have
had a steady upward tendency. There was
also a noticeable decrease in the prices of
hoots, clothing and furniture, and in
house-rents, and there was, during the
period covered by Coghlan’s figures, not
one noticeable increase in any article of
common consumption—in fact, the Pro-
tective period in New South Wales has been
par excellence the period of all-round cheap-
ness. The stereotyped arguments in favor
of Foreign-trade demonstrate, with appar-
ent clearness, that this state of things can’t
be, but, logically or illogically, the fact re-
mains that it is. Why it is' the Foreign-
trade logician is left to find out at his
leisure.
* • • *
During the same four years agriculture
progressed as it never progressed before in
New South Wales. The total area under
crops, which had remained almost stationary
during the ten years of Freetrade from 1881
to 1891, increased about 60 per cent, under
Protection between 1891 and 1895. The area
under wheat, which had barely doubled in
the last 13 years of the great importing
policy, now almost doubled itself in four
years, and the actual increase in the four
years between 1891 and 1895 was 50 per
cent, more than that in the 25 years between
1866 and 1891. In almost all other kinds of
grain-crops, as well as in potatoes, fruit, honey,
and other miscellaneous products, the in-
crease during the short period of Protection
was the biggest recorded in the history of
the province. And as the natural result
New South Wales, for the first time in its
history, came somewhere near to being self-
supporting in the matter of agricultural pro-
duce. All through the many years of Free-
trade, that province, despite its great area,
its small population and fertile soil, and the
distances from which imported supplies
have to be fetched, was helplessly dependent
on foreign growers for a large part of its sup-
plies of wheat, oats, barley, flour, eggs, fruit,
vegetables, butter, bacon, and many other
like articles. Also in most cases, right up to
the beginning of the Protective era, instead
of the local supplies getting nearer to an
equality with the demand they fell steadily
farther behind it. The brief period of the
Dibbs tariff reduced the imports of wheat,
oats, barley, and other grains by nearly one-
half, and of maize by three-fourths, thereby
saving £470,000 of hard cash per annum; and
made New South Wales a great exporter of
butter and cheese instead of an importer as
formerly, thereby bringing much money
into the country as well as preventing
a lot going out. In a very few years
more, at the same rate of progress, it would
have made New South Wales wholly in-
dependent of foreign supplies, and thereby
furnished much-needed employment to some
thousands of agriculturists and stopped a
ruinous drain on the national resources.
The Dibbs tariff, inefficient as it was, was
the only real atttempt to “ settle the people
on the land ” in the whole dismal course of
Botany Bay legislation.
* ♦ * *
In manufactures the brief period of Protec-
tion, despite the insufficiency and haphazard
characterof the tariff and various other things,
was one of reasonable prosperity. In 1892,
the first complete year of the national policy,
there was a large increase in the number of
persons employed in the factories and work-
shops of New South Wales. In 1893 —the
year of bank-smashes, panic, and paralysis—
there was a very large decrease—the largest
ever recorded in one year in the province.
In 1894, when the slow recovery began to
set in, there was the largest increase in New
South Wales history, though the recovery
was only partial at the best, and by no
means compensated for the previous year’s
downfall. But the net decrease was mostly
in the industries which were not protected
under the Dibbs tariff, and was as much a
proof of the evils of Freetrade as of those of
Protection. Comparing 1891 with 1894, the
total decline in the number of hands em-
ployed was 3384, and the falling-off in the
building trades owing to the dying away of
the borrowing boom, the economies prac-
tised in the railway workshops, and the
fluctuations of the sugar and tobacco indus-
tries, neither of which was interfered with
under the Dibbs tariff, accounted for more
than all of these. Most of the industries
which the tariff was specially designed to
encourage showed some slight increase of
employment, despite the banking crash, and
the great building and investment society
collapse, and all the other disasters of the
most disastrous period in the province’s
history. Altogether the Dibbs tariff, though
it had but a brief trial under very tem-
pestuous conditions, produced reasonably
good results even in manufacturing in-
dustries, although that was the department
in which it was least successful.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
During the Protective period New South
Wales, for the first occasion in more than 20
years, became for the time a solvent country
and paid the interest on its foreign debts,
public and private, out of its own resources
instead of paying them out of the proceeds
of new borrowings. A country which is
cumbered with a huge burden of foreign
debt must export as much more than it im-
ports as is necessary to cover interest on its
liabilities—or else it must incur more and
still more liabilities. The temporary
prosperity of the Foreign-trade epoch
was arrived at by the latter process,
and under the old regime which is
being so joyfully restored New South
Wales went to the had to the extent of
six or eight or even twelve millions per
annum and took no thought for the morrow.
The temporary adversity of the Protective
epoch was the result of an attempt to face
the hard realities of the situation and make
the country pay its liabilities out of its earn-
ings—a thing which had hardly been
previously attempted within the memory of
this generation. During this same period
the re-export trade of. New South Wales rose
to the largest figure ever recorded—a conclu-
sive answer to the theorists who allege that
Protection drives away commerce. The
shipping trade of the province attained its
high-water mark during the Protective era,
and the savings-bank deposits reached a
higher point than ever before. The public
debt increased at a slower rate than it had
done at any time during the last 16 years of
the old Foreign-trade era. And, despite the
oft-told lie about the “burden” which the
Protective tariff laid upon the people, the
amount taken from the people as Customs
duties in 1894, the last complete year of the
Dibbs tariff, was less than the amount ex-
tracted eight years previously from a smaller
population under the alleged Freetrade
policy, and the total amount of tariff taxation
per inhabitant was smaller than at any time
since 1880. Altogether, the alleged burden
of the Protective tariff' was about the most
hollow imposture that could well be ima-
gined.
♦ ♦ ♦ *
The chief reason of the downfall of the
Protectionist Government in New South
Wales was its ghastly ill-luck. The average
unreasoning inhabitant sets down to the
policy of the party in power at the moment
all the disasters that befall the country—
drought and flood and fire, bad crops, bank
failures, boom collapses, rust, weevil, large
blue flies, low prices for exports in foreign
markets, battle, murder, and sudden death,
all alike. And the Protectionist era was a
period of more unavoidable disaster than the
country had ever compressed into so short a
space of time before. The banks, building
societies, and investment institutions came
down with one hideous run, through many
years’ accumulated folly and mismanagement;
and though New South Wales came off better
than its neighbours, it came off badly enough.
The prices of New South Wales exports in
London, which had remained almost station-
ary from 1885 to 1890, dropped fully one-
fifth between 1892 and 1894, which involved
a loss of fully £4,'000,000 a year. Silver
declined so heavily that the value of the
province’s silver output fell between ’9l and
’94 to the extent of £1,300,000 per annum.
There was an almost equally heavy drop in
tin and copper. The opening-up of coal-
fields in Victoria and Japan so injured the
New South Wales coal-trade that the value
of the output declined between 1891 and
1894 to the extent of £600,000 a year, or
rather over one-third. The sheep-breeding in-
dustry, the main prop and stay of New South
Wales, had enjoyed seven years of splendid
good fortune and good wool prices from 1885
to 1891, and in that time the number of
sheep in the province increased from
37,000,000 to 61,000,000. Then with the
advent of the luckless Dibbs Government
came a sudden change ; in 1892-3-4 over
5,400,000 sheep perished through western
droughts, and, instead of an increase of 3g
millions per annum as formerly, there was a
decrease, at the time when wool prices were
lowest, of 2,000,000 a year. Yet, in the face
of this unparalleled combination of disasters,
the brief period during which New South
Wales followed the Protectionist faith was
the most prosperous in its history for many
years past, and the reckless abandonment of
the policy which achieved so much out of
such very had materials is one of the most
remarkable instances of popular ignorance,
ingratitude, and credulity imaginable.
The Great Calvert Myth.
That truly monotonous person, young Albert
F. Calvert, the “great Australian explorer,”
turns up again in the London papers, this Lime
in Jerome K. Jerome’s To-Day, wherein a
foolish nonentity named Gilbert D. Suther-
land grovels over him in a truly awful fashion.
The spectacle of Gilbert D. Sutherland slob-
bering Albert F. Calvert in Jerome K.
Jerome’s paper is a solemn essay on the evils
of having a gaunt initial slicking up in the
middle of your name. Sutherland’s painful
shriek is adorned with a portrait of Calvert,
in which he appears as a nice-looking, but
rather vacuous youth, with a waxed moustache
and a beautiful carriage-drive down the middle
of his head, and a large, ordinary-looking ear,
and silk facings on his coat, and a shirt-stud
about the size of a dinner-plate. ■ Nobody in
Australia that The Bulletin is aware of
ever heard of young Calvert exploring
anywhere in particular ; it is believed in
some quarters that another man of the same
name did a little in that way many years ago,
but even his doings didn’t amount to much,
and the mild, young person with the dinner-
plale on his abdomen is almost unknown in
these parts. Yet Gilbert D. Sutherland not
only grovels about him, but about all bis
ancestors, and particularly he goes on in a
dreadful fashion about bis grandfather. That
hair-raising progenitor seems to have been a
mixture of Bishop Pontoppidan, Munchausen,
the great sea-serpent and Deadwood Dick. In
his early days he “ went to Attaoama, in Peru”
(Sutherland doesn’t know how to spell
Atucuna, but that doesn’t matter) to study the
silver mines of Potosi, which are in Bolivia,
many miles away. How lie lived in Atacama,
which is a horrible land of death and flies and
alkali, is not stated, but while there he in-
vented the chlorination process. This was
about 1835, and the chlorination process was
invented by a quite different man some2o years
later, but that doesn’t matter much either.
• • •
Then the hair-waxed Calvert’s dreadful old
progenitor discovered gold in large quantities
in Wales, but somehow he seems to have done
nothing with it. He was also the first dis-
coverer of gold in New South Wales and
Maoriland—the fact that gold wasn’t heard of
in Maoriland for a good many years after his
alleged visit really doesn’t signify. Where-
abouts in Maoriland he made his gold-discovery
isn’t mentioned. He was likewise the first man
to find the Kapunga and Burra-Burra mines in
South Australia. It is hardly worth mention-
ing here that the Burra-Burra was dis-
covered by Pickett, and that Kapunga
is apparently a misprint for Kapunda,
and the Kapunda mine was found by
Francis Dutton. After this the ancient
mariner seems to have broken loose
from all semblance of fact or probability, and
raged promiscuously over a great sea of loose
fiction and gory adventure. He was tl(e first
man to find gold, silver, diamonds, and extinct
craters in S.A. Also, he was the first man to
find silver and gold in Tasmania. After that
he landed at Exmouth Gulf (W.A.), and was
the first man to find gold in that province also.
Likewise, he was the first man to discover coal
there ; in fact, speaking generally, he seems to
have been the first man to find anything any-
where. Then he founded Port Lyttelton (which
Gilbert Sutherland doesn’t know bow to
spell properly), and Christchurch (M.L.), and
did many other awful things which no one in
Australasia seems to remember ; and at last
he returned to England in a great glare and
howl of magnificence with a ton of pure gold.
Also, he owned an immense gold-mine on the
Amazon River, in South America. There is no
mention by any authority that The Bulletin
ever came across, or that anyone The Bulletin
ever heard of came across, of Calvert’s ton of
gold, and his famous coal-discovery was really
made by the Gregorys, but these small trifles
really don’t signify.
• # #
Old Calvert finished his career with a final
burst of magnificence. Says Gilbert D.
Sutherland
He was asked by Messrs. York and Company, the great
railway contractors, who had invested thousands in a
copper-mine without any result, to go to Devon to inspect
their location. On arriving at Okehampton he found the
shaft being put down in the middle of the town. At this
he demurred, telling them not only that there was no
copper there, hut that they were two miles out of the
way. To this Mr. Bird, a man of law, objected. How-
ever, Mr. Calvert, not to be beaten, ordered a trap to take
him southward, and, when he had proceeded a little over
two miles, indicated a position to sink a shaft, which hap-
pened to he in the centre of a highly-cultivated turnip-
field. Capt. James Richards, of the Devon Great Consols,
did all in Ids power to persuade Mr. York that no copper
could be found on the spot declaring that it was blas-
phemous in the eyes of God for anyone to say that he
could see what was under the ground without, first ex-
ploiting the same, and he offered to eat. all the copper
that should he found there. To cut a lonsr story short,
Mr. Calvert set to work. The shaft was commenced, and
called the Calvert, shaft. In six months’ time the driving
had cut into ricli copper-ore. A lump of about 3cwt. was
placed on the table at the White Hart Hotel, in Oke-
hampton, and a cover was made for it. Mr. York invited
a few friends to dine with him, not forgetting Capt. Jann s
Richards. At the right moment the cover was removed,
and Mr. York invited Capt. Richards to swallow his pill.
“Oh!” said Mr. James, “Mr. Calvert is either a very
clever man or a very lucky one."
Let them make a magic-lantern slide of that.
* * •
Then the biographer gets on to the present
Calvert. He was born in 1869, and was a
dreadfully remarkable infant. In 1890, when
he was only 21, be arrived in Victoria, and his
fame had preceded him to sucli an extent that
he was at once rushed by the directors of the
“National Bank of Australia” to report on
the Hustler’s Extended and Great Extended
mines, at Sandhurst. “He was unable to
endorse their valuation of the property.” It is
quite a trifling matter that there is no “ National
Bank of Australia,” and that the two mines in
question belong to private companies, so that
the bank, it it existed, would have no par-
ticular interest in having them valued. Also,
they were so well-known to everybody that
the idea of any bank, even if it existed, hiring
a small youth fresh from England to value
them is unique. After that, the story tails off
into vague and delirious whoops about Cal-
vert’s great exploring-expeditions in Westralia.
The details given are interesting in their mild
and harmless simplicity. Sutherland doesn’t
even state that Calvert went any distance or
was away any remarkable length of time.
The “ Westralian Paragon ” started from Roe-
bourne, which was then a decent-sized town,
and he got as far as Mallina, which was then
also an actual town just two days’ journey
from Roebourne by a moderately good road,
and then apparently he made for the telegraph-
line and seems to have followed it carefully,
presumably in order that the line-repairer
could find him if he got lost. This heroic ex-
pedition carried three months’ provisions in a
buggy (think of exploring with a buggy !) and
was badly bitten by ants. The biographer is
particular about the ants. Evidently it never
strikes him that the Australian gets ant-bitten
almost every Sunday. In the course of the
journey Calvert found vast deposits of gold
and didn’t wait to annex them ; crossed a
river-bed five miles wide; found more rich
gold, silver, and other metals ; found the richest
gold and antimony mine in the world and left
it there; found rubies, sapphires, and tour-
malines ; found another rich gold-reef; also
a very rich tin lode; also plains “literally
covered with oxide of manganese ” ; like-
wise a hill of gold, more tin-mines ; more
gold-mines ; and finally he gallantly sailed from
Port Darwin to Melbourne in the China mail
steamer, and made the acquaintance of Robert
Louis Stevenson. It is further mentioned
that the hero was considerably “ lacerated by
spinifex.” And now it is reported that Cal-
vert returns to Australia to explore some more,
and find a lot more things for the first time, and
again have his biographer sitting like a solemn
nightmare on the chest of this much-afflicted
land, where the memory of his wonderful grand-
father has so completely dropped out of sight
that nobody remembers that lie ever did any-
thing surprising. As a specimen of frantic


literature (price two-pence with coloured cover),
Gilbert D. Sutherland’s history of the
Calvert family is unique.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Victorian Railway Reform.
The new Victorian Railway Bill, which is to
put the Victorian railway service on a per-
manent and thoroughly efficient basis, is about
the weakest thing yet devised by the Turner
Government. The trouble in the Victorian
Railway Department is that the lines don’t pay
working expenses and interest on cost of con-
struction, and that they never have done so to
any great extent. The reasons for this state of
things are various. Victoria has too much rail-
way in proportion to population to make it
possible to cover expenses under existing condi-
tions. The money was borrowed at too high a
rate of interest by the mud-headed financiers of
the past, and far too much money was fooled
away on land-resumption swindles, therefore
the railways have to pay interest on perhaps
£3,000,000 more than they should do; and the
loans were fixed for too long a term, so that
they can’t be converted when a favorable oppor-
tunity presents itself. No railway system
situated as badly as Victoria’s is in all these
matters has ever paid working expenses and
interest at the rate Victoria has to pay.
The Turner Government, however, has found
two notable remedies for the present slate
of things. One is to place the railways in
charge of a Trust, the members of which
will receive £750 a year each, and the
Trust is to appoint a General Manager, subject
to the approval of the Governor-in-Couuci 1
which is about as interesting as if the appoint-
ment was subject to the approval of the Gover-
nor in his shower-bath. In old days the
Minister was practically the General Manager ;
this system was a distinct failure. Then the
responsibility was shifted one step further on
by the Ministry appointing a Commissioner to
do the management. Now it is moved on two
steps by the Ministry appointing the Trustees
and the Trustees appointing the Manager ; and
if this fails it will presumably be moved along
three steps by the Ministry appointing a Board,
which will appoint the Trustees, who will
appoint the Manager. The other remedy is
still more remarkable and is expressed as
follows :—■
In the following oases, that is to say : —(a) Where Par-
liament makes any alteration in the law which occasions
any increase of expenditure by the trust or any decrease
of the railways revenue ; or (b) where Parliament directs
the trust to carry out any system or matter of policy
which occasions or results in any increase of expenditure
by the trust or any decrease of the railways revenue ; or
(c) where Parliament authorises the construction of any
new line of railway which, when vested in the trustees,
does not produce sufficient revenue to cover the interest
on its cost of construction, and the expenses of its main-
tenance the annual amount of the increase of expendi-
ture or decrease of revenue or of the loss resulting from
such new line of railway shall be from time to time
notified in writing by the trust to the Commissioners of
Audit, and, if certified by them, shall be provided by
Parliament in the annual Appropriation Act and paid to
the trust.
This simply means that the general revenue is
to makegood the railway deficit, and as it does
so now, and always has done so, and must keep
on doing so in any case, this is not a very
bright or original idea. Anyhow, it leaves the
deficit just where it was ; the “ notification in
writing ” doesn’t alter the case in the least.
The only way to reduce the shortage on the old
lines is to diminish expenses, or to cut down
interest on borrowed capital, or to increase
revenue, or to do two or all three of these
things at once, and if they can’t be done just
now, the only way is to let the shortage stand.
And the best way to prevent a loss on new
lines is to build them cheaply on the better-
ment principle, and to construct them wholly
or in great part out of revenue instead of with
borrowed money. But no amount of mere
stationery can alter the situation. The fact that
the Trust is to notify the Audit Commissioner
about the deficit, which he knows of already,
and he is to certify to Parliament, which is
fully aware of the matter in any case, and
Parliament is to argue at great length about
voting the amount, which is already spent
whether Parliament votes it or not, and finally
tell the Ministry to tell the Trust that it will
be paid when it has to be paid anyhow, is
merely so much wasted ink and circumlocution,
and won’t alter the situation one copper.
The “ First Offender.”
Item from Queensland paper
The criminal sittings of the Supreme Court were con-
tinued yesterday before S. W. Griffith, Chief Justice. A
young man, named Marks, charged with loitering in the
public streets with intent to commit a felony, was sen-
tenced to six months’ hard labor. Alphonse L. Pene,
late agent for the Queensland National Bank at Mitchell
(on the Maranoa River), was sentenced to two years’ hard
labor for embezzlement. The total defalcations amounted
to t'l2B. The prisoner was released under the Offenders’
Probation Act upon entering into the necessary sureties.
The old story : the man of no social account
who does six months’ worth of alleged crime
gets his six months, and the high-toned person
who does two years’ worth gets nothing. Yet
it is just possible that Griffith, C.J., acted up
to what he thought were his genuine convic-
tions, though they were only his hazy eye-
impressions. The man who is shabbily dressed,
and who has been in gaol awaiting trial, so that
his beard has grown coarse and scrubby, and
his hair hasn’t been done by a barber, nor his
boots cleaned, nor his linen newly got up at the
Chinese laundry, and who has enjoyed few
bathing facilities in the lock-up, always looks
an irreclaimable ruffian on whom mercy would
be wholly wasted. And the man whose well-
to-do friends have bailed him out, and
who has bought a new suit of clothes
out of his stealings, and who turns up in
the dock clean-shaven and nicely hair-parted
and with a dazzling dickey, and rests a white
band on the railing, always looks like a saint
who, even if he has given way to sudden
temptation, deserves a chance to reform.
How would justice go, The Bulletin wonders,
if the accused was concealed behind a thick
mosquito-curtain during his trial, so that his
appearance couldn’t affect the jury or the J udge
one way or another? Then, if he was found
guilty, he could be removed, still unseen, and
when the sittings were over the accumulated
prisoners could be brought up for sentence, all
fixed up alike by the gaol barber, and dressed
alike in grey slop suits and Crimean shirts, so
that no man would look more villainous than
another unless the villainy was inherent in his
countenance. Then a conscientious Judge
would have a fair chance of considering each
offender on his merits. Many a Judge who has
consistently refused to give the shabby criminal
a chance under the First Offenders’ Act if he
could be gaoled for 14 days awaiting trial, and
then photographed in the dock with a straggly
undergrowth on his face, and a dirty collar,
and disordered hair, and long nails, and the
whitewash of the cell on his clothes, would find
that he also looked about the last person that
he would dream of letting loose upon society.
And if this picture was always kept before him
on the judicial desk, then John Smith, accused
on the hazy charge of being “a suspected
person,” might meet with a lot more justice
than he does. Some day The Bulletin will
perhaps print Griffith’s portrait as he would
look under Mark’s conditions, and ask him
if he could feel, under such conditions, like
a person who deserved any consideration what-
ever.
Sneaking-in Protection.
Premier Reid lately struck the truly brilliant
idea of paying <£50,000 a year out of revenue as
a subsidy to the N.S.W. Railway Department,
so that the Department might pay it back to the
revenue later on as part of the regular receipts,
and, as a natural consequence, the railway
earnings would profess to be so much more, and
the deficit so much less than the real figure.
There are at least four decided objections to
this device, altogether apart from its humorous
imbecility. It is done to enable the rates on
agricultural and dairy produce to be re-
duced, therefore it is professedly a system
of Protection for the agricultural interest,
proposed to be “sneaked in” by a Govern-
ment which lives by denouncing Protection
and gets its salary under false pretences
by professing to abolish it. It is also a
foolish and reckless outlay by a Government
which lives upon vain promises to reduce
expenditure. It is further a foolish and clumsy
“ faking ” of the public accounts. If the rates
on produce are so reduced as to bring in
<£50,000 a year less than they now do, then the
railway deficit will be .£50,000 a year more than
it is at present. If the nation reckons that it
is worth while having that amount added to
the existing deficit to secure certain advantages
for a certain class it is its own affair, but at all
events it should know exactly how it stands,
and this method of making the railway receipts
look £50,000 larger and the shortage that much
smaller than reality seems expressly devised to
keep the country from gaining this knowledge.
And, as a fourth objection, this new departure
makes an end of the boasted commercial
system, and is the beginning of more political
interference. If the principle is once estab-
lished that the Government may demand that
coal, or carrots, or gin, or galvanised iron, or
“ colonial ” beer, or any product in which it
takes an interest for any reason, honest or
otherwise, shall be carried below cost, provided
it pays the loss out of the public Treasury so as to
make the railway accountsfoo& square when they
are not, then the railways are no longer being
run on straight business principles, and the era
of political dodgery has started again. The one
great purpose of the Commissioner system was
to put the railways beyond Government inter-
ference, so that no Ministry could use them as
a means wherewith to secure the support of
any person or class at the expense of the
community at large, and that is just what
the Reid Government avowedly wants to
do. And while the Ministry thus bids
for the agricultural and pastoral vote by
falling away into the paths of Protection, it
is not even dead certain whether the Protection
is all for the native, or partly for him and
partly for the foreigner. The reduced rates
for which the community at large will be
taxed if the scheme ever gets through will pre-
sumably apply all round, and in that case the
nation will pay to enable the Sydney importer
to send foreign grain into the nearer country
towns to compete against the N.S.W. pro-
ducer, as well as to enable the latter to send
his produce into the cities. This is a fifth
aspect of the case which calls for some slight
inquiry. Protection of this variety was hardly
expected, even from the most rampant of
Foreign-trade Governments.
The Law and the Pugilist.
In Sydney, last week, John Barker, amateur
practitioner in the art of manly disfigurement,
went through the formality of being tried for
“ inflicting grievous bodily harm ” on the bat-
tered Dutchman, Placke, and was duly ac-
quitted. Therefore, the law either decided
that Placke wasn’t grievously harmed, which
is impossible ; or that it wasn’t Barker, but
some other person, who harmed him, which
looks wholly improbable ; or that the mashing
of a man in a pugilistic encounter isn’t recog-
nised as an offence at law, in which case the
matter should have been left alone from the
beginning ; or else it decided that no blame
attached because the injury wasn’t intentional,
in which case Barker would of necessity have
been held equally guiltless if Placke had died
from his injuries. Amid all these muddled
alternatives it seems about time the law
seriously defined its position in regard to
aggravated pugilism. The statutes of New
South Wales were fully cognisant of the fact
that Barker and Placke intended meeting for
the express purpose of assault and battery.
Certain legal agents were there and saw
them assault and batter in pursuance of this
purpose. They met, in short, to do bodily
harm to each other, and both they and the
law were fully aware that they might do a lot
more harm than they intended. As the law,
being fully forewarned, allowed them to take
the chance of whatever might happen, its
futile attempt to kick afterwards was wholly
absurd and illogical. If it was illegal for
Barker and Placke to meet for the express
purpose of obliterating each other’s features at
the risk of skull-fracturc and accidental death,
then the agents of the law, who didn’t stop
them when they had the opportunity, were
accomplices in the act and should have been
tried along with Barker. If the meeting
wasn’t illegal, but only the accidental skull-
fracture, still the fact remains that the law
permitted the circumstances that led up to the
said fracture, well knowing that such circum-
stances were liable to lead up to things of the
kind. Moreover, it was wholly absurd to
arrest Barker for hitting Placke unless the
law also arrested Placke for hitting Barker.
These two unscienced men swiped wildly
at each other with the same purpose
in view, and the difference between
them lay chiefly, if not solely, in the
fact that an inscrutable Providence made
Barker the taller and longer-armed man
of the pair. Therefore, the law should either
have charged all the parties concerned, includ-
ing the police and the Government, with the
same offence, or else it should have let them all
go and arrested Providence alone. The law is
hereby invited to seriously consider these dis-
crepancies, and if it has any definite attitude
in the pugilistic business, then it would do well
to explain it at once. The failure of the
Barker prosecution merely suggests that it
has been hiring an expensive lawyer to appear
before itself an 1 find out if it has an attitude,
and the verdict has been that it doesn’t know
whether it has one or not.
A Unique Dinner.
The dinner given the other day, in Melbourne,
to celebrate Syme’s defeat of Speight, was
unique in many ways. It was the first time on
record that a grateful counsel feted his client,
with a view to reminding the outside world
that “absolutely nothing has been done
latterly ” towards taking up a collection for the
victim. Then the guest, and the oratory !
The company couldn’t separate without drink-
ing the health of Parliament. Parliament was
the corrupt railway-making institution that, on
David Syme’s showing, had “ debauched ”
Speight. So they drank its health. Deakin
returned thanks, both as an M.L.A. and a
junior counsel for Syme in the legal victory
under discussion. Deakin was first lieu-
tenant to Premier Gillies, and, therefore,
a prime mover in the ruin of Victoria
(vide Age) through the agency of Speight.
Suitable man to return thanks on this occasion.
Deakin blandly stated that “ the first insight
he gained into the condition of railway affairs
he could truly say was acquired by reading the
Age articles. The Ministry to which he
belonged also first awoke to the threatening
prospects of the future through what was
said in those articles.” He might have men-
tioned that the Ministry to which he belonged
was tottering into oblivion before the articles
appeared. He might have admitted that he
was included, years afterwards, in the list of
politicians who brought pressure to bear upon
Speight. But he didn’t. Ex-Chief Secretary
Deakin, the man who really represented
David Syme in the Gillies Ministry, was con :
tent to plead sinful ignorance re the Gillies-
Deakin Railway expenditure previous tp read-
ing something about it in the Age. Therefore,
he blessed the Age for having pointed out the
error of his ways at the eleventh hour, when
his capacity for bringing the country to ruin
was exhausted. And his former colleague Dow,
who sat somewhere in the vicinity, backed him
up with several cheerful “ Hear, hears.” A
unique dinner.
Picked Marks.
The case of Gail, the alleged bigamist, is
another remarkable side-issue of the Dean trial.
Gail was a Crown witness against Dean, and
just before the most interesting part of the case
came on he was arrested on a charge of bigamy.
So far as appears, he was technically more or
less guilty ; his offence seems to have arisen,
however, through a mere misconception of the
law on his part, and he was presently dis-
charged. The surprising part of the story is
that the Crown didn’t prosecute Gail according
to its usual custom, or send a big legal authority
to enthusiastically demand his conviction ;
instead it paid the costs of his defence, which
was quite a novel character for the Crown to
appear in. And, seeing that the same Crown
lately stopped the miserable allowance formerly
paid for defending penniless prisoners arraigned
on capital charges, and while prosecuting them
all it knows leaves their defence practically
to take care of itself, and that it took this
course on the ground that there were no
funds available for defence purposes, it
would be interesting to know how funds
became so suddenly available in this par-
ticular instance. If it could find the money
to defend Gail, who was in no serious
danger, and who was not penniless, then it
presumably can find money from the same
source to pay for the defence of other men who
are penniless, whose lives are at stake, and who
are much more in want of defence, inasmuch as
the whole legal machinery of the State is at
work for the prosecution. There is no earthly
reason why the Crown shouldn’t have defended
Gail, providing it did the same in the case of
other accused persons —such as the perse-
cuted Mrs. Butler —who require it a lot more;
but it doesn’t—it prosecutes them instead, and
if they have to hang or go to gaol for many
years for want of adequate defence it simply
lets them hang or go to gaol. If there is no
money for the defence of accused persons then
was the money for Gail’s defence misappro-
priated from some other fund ? And if it was,
will the legal authorities of Botany Bay, in the
name of common decency and humanity, mis-
appropriate some more from the same source,
whatever it may be, to defend the next man
who can’t hire a lawyer to show cause why he
shouldn’t go to prison or the gallows ?
A Victorian gunner who sued the State, the
other day, for £6 17s. 3d., part of his retiring
allowance, evoked some interesting information
about the status of the gaudy military person
in uniform. The authorities refused to pay
this amount, which Chief Justice Madden
decided was legally due and ought to be paid,
but all the same the C.J. found against the
plaintiff because, according to law, “a soldier
cannot sue the Queen,” however just his claim
may be. Any other adult person may sue the
Queen if he thinks he has a grievance against
her, but the miserable object in a glaring coat
and a helmet isn’t allowed to. A further hard-
ship was that this particular plaintiff didn’t
want to sue the Queen ; he simply wanted to
sue the person who paid his wages —the Vic.
Treasurer. But, legally, it seems, the Vic.
Treasurer is the Queen, though he presents no
visible resemblance to her, and the State
generally is the same Gracious personage, so a
soldier can get no satisfaction from anybody.
If the Queen doesn’t pay his wages, or if she
runs a train over him, or if he is interfered with
in any capacity by her policeman, or her flun-
key, or is bitten by her dog, or kicked by her
horse, or maltreated by her in any way through
any of her agents, he has no redress. And,
considering that the Queen, in a technical sense,
is spread all over the earth, and a soldier is
liable to be injured by her with impunity in
almost any part of the globe, this decision takes
a good deal of the glory out of the military pro-
fession. Apparently, if a military man is
aggrieved by the Queen anywhere the only
satisfaction lie can get is to promptly “stoush”
his sovereign lady through her responsible
representative, and then take the consequences.
Judge Hodges, of Victoria, believing himself
to be inspired to some extent, takes no stock in
juries. A Gippsland man named Ruggles,
charged with wounding a fellow selector’s
animals, was brought in not guilty by two
juries. Before sending the accused about his
business his Honor relieved his feelings in the
following “ piece ” :
You have been tried by two juries and found not guilty
You are fortunate in that you have been tried by a jury
instead of by a Judge. If you had you would have been
convicted. Now, let me caution you, lest next time you
are brought here on a hanging matter.
Ruggi.es was a man who bore a good character
as a quiet, hardworking reclaimer of the wilds ;
the evidence against him was mainly circum-
stantial, and failed to satisfy 24 good men and
true ; the 25th was satisfied, and being a Judge
was, unfortunately, in a position to jump on
the accused with all his feet, and give it out to
the world that the latter at the best is only a par-
ticularly lucky ruffian, and at the worst a possible
murderer. The Bui.i.etin holds that the jury
should have had the power to incontinently send
Hodges to gaol for contempt of court after that
speech. Also, it holds that it should becompetent
for Ruggles, or somebody else, to sue Hodges
for libel and recover heavy damages. Hodges
asserted as distinctly as possible, after the
accused’s character had been legally cleared by
the verdict of acquittal, either that he was
guilty of the mean and cruel offence charged
against him and that if he had been tried
before a Judge only he would have been con-
victed because he was guilty, in which case he
misused the privileges of his position to out-
rageously insult a legally innocent man—or
else that if Ruggles had been tried before a
Judge only he would have been convicted des-
pite his innocence, in which case it was dis-
tinctly implied that Hodges himself and his
brother Judges were quite unfit for their posi-
tions and were howling for the blood of innocent
men. Either way, Hodges should be called
upon to explain himself.
Hear Bulletin, —Your correspondent,
“J.5.R.,” has missed the kernel of the agita-
tion foi evening lectures at Melbourne Univer-
sity. The main objections to that proposal
were really that it would deprive the professors
and the sons of gilt Toorak or Boomville of
their social pleasures. The agitation was not
for additional lectures by a special staff in the
evening, but that all lectures at the University
should, where practicable, be delivered at night
by the ordinary staff.. And, as the University
was granted its charter in order that sound
learning might be given to all classes of the
community without any distinction whatever,
and as the vast bulk of the community cannot
possibly attend in the daytime, the persistence
of the University authorities in arranging the
lectures for unsuitable times comes perilously
near a deliberate breach of the charter. In any
case, the Legislature can and ought to make it
a condition of any further grant of money that
the majority of the lectures should be given at
night. The good of universities is, perhaps,
problematical; but when the people have got
to pay for one, they might as well have the use
of it.—D.
Dear Bulletin, —Collective Man is a blood-
thirsty animal. When any particular offence has
become unusually prevalent, the community
always wants to punish the next person con-
victed thereof, not upon the merits of his own
case, but collectively on behalf of all the other
offenders whom it has allowed to escape.
Which is why while it has agitated
vehemently on many a murder-in-fact—it has
remained so apathetic about Sheridan, who is
only a murderer-in-law, and whose hanging
would be another ghastly Botany Bayism.—

Ed. Bulletin, —There are plenty of platypi
along from Mareeba to Kuranda in the Barron

If you want a pleasant evening in W.A.,
writes a Bulletin correspondent, live next dooi
to an Afghan camp. Soon after tea every night a
draped and ghost-like figure steps forward into
the firelight and begins in a low monotone, gradu-
ally increasing in volume and untunefulness, to
enumerate the things he has done, is doing, could
do, and is going to be about to not-do, until naturt
refuses further utterance; whereupon up springs
another child of the desert anxious to “ cap ” tin
deeds of wonder enacted by the other, and repeats
da capo. The howls are accompanied by a banjo-
like instrument of torture, on which an untiring
accompanist tries to guess at and follow the prob-
able refrain of the “singer,” and fails dismally.
About 11.30 p.m. things get exciting, everyone
joining in, in different keys, husky with much
shouting, ending in one long fell screech that puts
even the pibroch of a pack of dingoes in the shade;
Then the suffering neighbors curse for the last
time and go to sleep.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Theatre Royal “ Pat, or the Bells of
Rathbeal.”
Her Majesty’s.... “ Robinson Crusoe.”
Tivoli Rickards’Variety Co.
Sydney Music Hall Variety Co.
MELB. SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess’s Theatre “ La Belle Therese.”
Opera House Rickards’Variety Co.
A new Australian opera, “ Club Life,”
try A. B. Paterson (the “ Banjo ”) and Ernest
Truman, was executed, or rather lynched, by an
amateur co. at Sydney Lyceum last Thursday.
This was its first stage appearance, and the com-
pany, in a perfectly well-meaning spirit, knocked
it down and jumped on it right from the beginning.
What it would have looked like under better
auspices The Bulletin doesn’t pretend to know, for
it was inaudible to the present writer all through.
The chorus was painted in a more reckless and un-
real fashion than even the amateur chorus gene-
rally attains to, and seemed to feel its position
keenly. There were long, anxious pauses, during
which nobody spoke, and moments of dreadful
anxiety, when the orchestra didn’t know whether
to start out for an encore or not. This hopeless
uncertainty on the part of the orchestra kept
things in an unsettled state all night. After
a decisive burst of applause, the singer
would advance to the footlights and open
her mouth preparatory to starting again, and, as
the orchestra was always too late in making up
its mind, she would close her mouth again, after a
deplorable interval during which the audience
had seriously considered her back tooth, and pro-
ceed to retire. And then, when she was just
vanishing, the music would suddenly make up its
disjointed intellect and commence, and she would
have to scuttle to the front again. After one
decided encore, the large, heavy man of the co.
opened his mouth three times to sing another
verse, and finally, in despair, he started on his
own without any music. Even this broad hint,
however, didn’t get the melody into motion, and
it wasn’t till after he had stopped in disgust that
the choir began in a flurried sort of way. Most of
the performers were nervous and much grieved,
and wore the fixed expression of one who is trying
to look happy in tight boots. Misses Celia Marks,
Alison Rose and Austin, and Mr. Geo. Clibborn
are omitted from the general execration, but, so
far as concerns the rest, it would have been better
if the opera had been struck by lightning on a
Friday and then arrested for being in a public
place with intent to commit a felony. Under all
these painful conditions, the composer’s music
didn’t get much more of a show than the libretto ;
in fact, nothing got much of a show except the
back tooth of the lady who received an encore and
was waiting for the orchestra to start.
** * *
“ His Natural Life ” is announced, at time
of writing, to be succeeded at Her Majesty’s by
three days (Thursday to Saturday)
of “ Robbery Under Arms,” and
after that the pantomime, which
is being built on a scale of great
magnificence, falls due on Tuesday.
The late convict production de-
veloped no new horrors since last
reported on, but all the old horrors
continued in good order till the very
end. Gabbett’s pursuit of the small,
funny convict with the axe, with a
view to having that stunted person
for lunch, was even a more satisfy-
ing performance towards the finish
than it was at first, and the agonised
flight of the small, funny convict
was a sporting event of some in-
terest. By way of furnishing a
highly condensed epitome of the
drama, The Bulletin presents on
this page a sketch of Gabbett’s teeth,
which suggest the spikes on the
gates of hell in a state of disrepair.
Gabbett and his bristles, and his teeth, and
his gory howl are the story of the System
put into the smallest possible space, and that
raucous, death’s-head convict will shriek and
gnash through the long years of history as a
record of the good old Australian Past.
** * *
The co. at Sydney Royal apparently
decided after all to treat the co. at Her Majesty’s
with silent contempt, or something to that effect,
therefore it didn’t put up its rival version of
“ His Natural Life ”as expected. If it had done
so it might possibly have ruined the other show so
utterly that the management would have been re-
duced to keeping a coffee-stall, so it doubtless for-
bore from motives of Christian charity. Also
certain reports that the Royal was going to get an
injunction, or a decree nisi, or an egg-beater, or
some other legal instrument against the other
house, seem to have dropped out of sight for the
present. The “ Silence of Dean Maitland ” filled
m the balance of the season with reasonable suc-
cess, and Johnson Weir’s Dean improved mate-
rially in places as time went on. This week the
co. has moved on to Brisbane, and the Royal is
temporarily deserted.
♦ * * ♦
On Saturday Mr. C. B. Westmacott will
commence a season at the Royal with “ Pat, or the
Bells of Rathbeal,” a musical comedy never before
seen in Australia. Westmacott, Wilfred Shine,
Sweeny, and Misses Harrie Ireland and Florence
Forde are in the cast, so that Patrick commences
with good chances in his favor.
* * *
Sydney Lyceum closed up on Saturday
after a week of that good old play “ Blow for
Blow,” and two nights of “One of Our Girls.”
The theatre now remains empty until the return
of those old reliable favorites, the Brough and
Boucicault Co., on the 26th, and in the interim the
wall-pauer in the gallery will probably be renewed
where the hair-oil mark of the local hoodlum is
painfully visible from the d.c.
* * -* *
The luckless and much-deserted Criterion,
which has had no continuous good fortune since
the departure of the B. and B. combination, is to
be fe-opened on Boxing Night by Pollard’s
Juvenile Opera Co. in “Olivette,” a piece which
hasn’t been seen in Sydney since the days of the
Israelitish captivity, or thereabouts.
** * *
Alice Leamar has been absent a good
deal from the Tivoli owing to indisposition,
and that establishment is shorn of much of
its glory when this wild and jumpy artiste
is not in the bill. Meanwhile, the Ivanoff
Brothers, alleged to be from Russia, have
thrown themselves into the gap, and the Lenton
Brothers are due on Saturday. Rickards is
running a good deal to brothers just now ; possibly
he considers them appropriate to the Xmas season
when brotherly love continues, or might continue
if it had ever got started.
** * *
The Sydney Music Hall put up a really
joyous novelty this week in the person of Walter
Rivers, whose imitation of a pious social festivity
in the school-room, under the eye of the mild new
curate, and assisted by the local shoemaker and
others, proved to be something quite out of the
ordinary rut. There is nothing in all this world
quite so serious as a social evening in an agricul-
tural English schoolroom, under the supervision
of the curate and the “squiah,” and helped on
apologetically by the local bootmaking lout, while
the humble aged inhabitant named Crump, who
carts mud fora living, sleeps with his mouth open
on the back seat. Australia never produced any-
thing even distantly resembling that festivity, and
no music-hall man that The Bulletin knows of
lias attempted to put it on the stage before.
* * *
Mark Twain bas returned to Sydney after
a tour in Maoriland, where he did well nearly
everywhere save at Gisborne. It was too rough to
land in that unreliable roadstead, so the agonised
Smythe saw the profits of the Gisborne visit
vanish over the horizon. Twain will lecture in
Sydney School of Arts on Friday and Saturday
this week. It is to be a new lecture, and will
embody the Australian poem which was unfinished
on his previous visit, and which has since been
completed with much greater difficulty than the
results seem to be worth.

“La Belle Tberese,” the new comedy-
opera at Melbourne Princess’s, is a one-man show,
having a tangled back-ground of gaudy soldiery
and school-girls in flaxen wigs. The prevailing
character is a village notary, twin brother to the
music-master in “ Nitouche,” and first-cousin to
Mayor Polydore of “The Old Guard.” Circum-
GA BBETT'S TEETH, i n " His Nalural Life” at Her
Majesty's.
stances place the notary in petticoats for awhile
and then he becomes a rampageous caricature of’
Charley’s Aunt. Take him altogether, this lead-
ing personage is a very cheerful joke, very well
interpreted by George Lauri. But “La Belle
Therese” needs to develope its natural re-
sources and profit by experience. Up to
now the story seems' to have been trans-
lated from the French by somebody whose name
wasn’tworth mentioning on the bill, and some of the
lyrics are rocky roads for a warbler to travel. One
naughty song, which probably delighted Paris,
appeals to Melbourne in this sort of form :
Francois, now colonel and commander,
Thought “The discovery of my wife’s infidelity is at
hand ; ”
Soon he saw her wander
Off to keep an appointment she had planned. &c., &c.
The musical numbers are weak in a general way.
The best of them is a concerted piece that may
have been shaken from an opera. The worst is a
music-hallish solo with a jodel refrain. A young
lady sings it in an uncanny voice, regardless
any meaning in the words, and the result is a
double encore. Nothing fetches the Melbourne
gods like a jodel, clever or otherwise. This is a
very second-rate jodel, but no matter. Give them
a little bit of “ tolloiete ! tolloietee !” and the boys
go mad.
* • • •
Miss Florence Young plays the name-part
in “La Belle Therese.” She romps in an easy
second, about twenty yards behind Lauri. If the
part were stronger Miss Young would get much
nearer to the winner, for this is about her most
vivacious effort thus far. Miss Juliet Wray fills
a fairly prominent position in a distinctly foreign
style, Ilhe is an ex-actress of uncertain age, and
she looks the character to the life. Miss Wray’s
style and accent are not exactly French, but the
effect is fur Tin and satisfactory. The other people
don’t go for very much. Little Miss Nash
runs an incidental Purity Society with
success, and Courtice Pounds tries to take
himself seriously as a romantic lover in a prepos-
terous uniform. He doesn’t appear to try hard,
however, though he makes a point of singing a
few lines sweetly at the last moment, by way of
surprising the audience. The chorus is admirable,
as usual.
** * *
The Princess’s will be closed on Monday
and Tuesday next, leaving the Opera House to
revel in a bloated monopoly pro tern. The Oross-
ley Sisters, described as Hingland’s “leading
soubrettes and society girls,” make their first Aus-
tralian appearance at the Opera House on Satur-
day. Meantime, Coleman is preparing to transfer
his legs to the Firm’s theatre for Xmas., as per
contract.
** * *
A new High Art Society, constructed by
the indomitable Miss Frances Tyrrell Gill in place
of a similar society which lately died of Philistinic
neglect, gave an inaugural “At Home” at Mel-
bourne Masonic Hall the other night. The
function took the form of a musical evening,
relieved by light refreshment, and an ancient
German botanist threw in a few remarks gratis.
The remarks were unintelligible, but sooth-
ing. A string quartette party, of the first
water, achieved an artistic success with a classic
thingummy in F major. On the other hand, the
vocalism proved to be of a kind which no society
can hold up to acute admiration for long. Never-
theless this society, known as the Illuminated (in
plain Australian language) has The Bulletin’s
best wishes. Melbourne requires all the artistic
light it can get. If the Illuminators really take
an interest in the things they chatter about, and
are anxious to do something definite, this journal
craves permission to say “ Amen.”

Coleman, the leg humorist, suffers from a
perennial fit of depression. He acquired the habit
of melancholy long ago—when he was a racing
stable-boy, sworn to secrecy concerning the ’osses
and their doings on the training-track, at the cold,
grey hour of daybreak. He is never observed to
smile ; his horsey, care-worn face won’t run to it.
In a general way, Coleman’s expression threatens
to burst into tears, and his favorite antidote to
grief is a toothpick, which he chews, jockey-like,
whilst discussing stage business, as though it were
the beloved straw of the horse-profession.
At Poverty Point.
Elton joins the Firm’s comic opera company for the
forthcoming tour. Also, it seems probable that Tapley,
who lingers on in Melbourne, will re-engage himself.
Courtioe Pounds objects to being specified as a “tenor,”
when he is “ an actor and a dancer, with a tenor voice.”
There’s a good deal in this protest. There is also a good
deal in Pounds : all the same, his visit to Australia doesn’t
promise to he a very happy circumstance.
John Lawler has shut down on the deadhead industry
at his Sydney Music Hall. After a brief experience of the
business, he has .come to the conclusion that there are
2200 alleged press representatives doing the variety shows
in Sydney alone, and their hurt expression when they
don't get in on the nod is larger than the front of the
General Post Office.
Polly Emery’s smudged slavey in “ Our Boys ” was a
fine example of mingled coal-dust and vacancy, and one of
the best things in facial expression seen on the Australian
stage. The London cheap slavey is pale through confine-
ment and an unnatural desire to eat the flabby pikelet for
tea: and wild-eyed through reading in the London
Journal about the beautiful Muriel, who was persecuted
by a h’earl; and has the drawn, bony expression of one
who carries coals up six flights of stairs for 16 hours a
day, and Polly Emery’s Belinda represented her to a hair
—the same hair that she drops in the gravy so regularly.
Mark Twain had his grisly hair cut at Napier, and now
relics of the great humorist are being sold at fancy prices.
Nearly lewt. of Mark’s hair has already been disposed of.
Tenor Pounds much feels his fatness and tries to reduce
it by cycling. He is already a conspicuous figure about
Melb. in his knickers, golf socks and the rest of it.
Dacre inherited a goodly fortune from his father, said
fortune being made mostly out of a certain brand of
court-plaster. Dacre, who was both an M.D. and Sc. 8.,
only gained his medical degree because it was the chief
condition of his inheriting under the old man’s will. He
never really oared tor medicine, and probably only re-
tained about enough of his surgical knowledge to make
his suicide effective.
E. J. Lonnen, the comedian whose skin acted so well,
has had his eyeball damaged by a careless cabby’s whip-
lash. While driving in the average hansom it is much
safer to wear goggles.
Apropos the Dacres, thus Francis Bacon : “ There is no
passion in the mind of man so weak but it mates and
masters the fear of death. Revenge triumphs over death,
love slights it, honor aspireth to it, and grief fleeth to it.”
Maggie Moore’s burlesque co. will play Ballarat and
Bendigo for the Xmas-New Year season. “ Little Jack
Sheppard” and Steele Robertson’s “Aladdin Junior” will
be the menu, possibly with a dramatic season later.
George Rignqld is said, on no authority worth men-
tioning, to be contemplating another scriptural drama,
based on the career of David. One theory is that G.R.
will play the part of David, and that Goliath of Gath will
be somewhat shortem cl to make him fit in. Another is
that Rignold will play Goliath, ■who will be represented as
an estimable Philistine, while David will be made a mere
side issue.
John Coleman, now on the boards at Melb. Opera
House, hut who has been retained for the Princess’s panto.,
is a comedian of experience. He took to the stage at the
age of four, but on reaching the maturer years of eight he
.abandoned it for the racing stables of the celebrated
Matthew Dawson. After 10 years he returned again to
the footlin as, r id has been there more or less ever since.
Charles Godfr, y. who comes out to Australia under
engagement to Harry Rickards, started his professional
career at a salary of 15s. week. For this he negotiated, at
the Elephant and Castle Theatre, 13 parts a week, besides
act! ig as ballet-master.
O P : “ Rr.sevear’s Mikado is a surprise to playgoers
who do not admire that roley-poley young opera-tor as a
general thing: it is quite a clever and original performance.
This Mikado differs from others we have known in being
fat and juicy and obviously a humorist who chuckles
grr-'si.s behind ms fan at his own * innocent merriment,’
and i i I laving everybody on toast in his sly, Japanese way.”
“The Forty Thieves” is to be played at Perth this
season. Forty will never be missed from Coolgardie and
its vicinity.
Melb. Aob, in a leader, describes Paula Tanqueray as
“ a neurotic convert to respectability ” and Pinero as “ a
feeble imitator.”
“ Predatoros ” Robinson, ex-Oov., has hypnotised
Colonel North, they say, in so far as the gallant Tower
Hamlets volunteer is going to finance his opera at the
London Shaftesbury. The libretto has been touched up
by Guy Boothby, and it is vaguely alleged that Nellie
Stewart will take the leading part whea the piece is pro-
duced.
George Rignold on a bicycle 1 Henry V. on a rocking-
horse ! Marc Antony in bloomers ! Fancy the oratory of
Caesar’s avenger being hurled at the clumsy cab-driver on
the wood-blocked street by a portly rider capsized along-
side a fruit-barrow! The cycle, however, may take off
some of that too too solid flesh under which G.R. now
groans.
Wallace Brownlow is “resting” on an up-country
station, rounding up cattle in bush-whacking attire.
After fifteen months’ continuous singing with the Royal
Comic Opera Co., Brownlow’s vocal works want oiling,
and he will not be in the bill again until the co. goes on
tour at Xmas.
People who know the circumstances are remarking
that hi a week for an actor who is playing a leading
part in a big Australian theatre is a remarkably mean
wage, anyhow.
A beery person from way back slept out a recent Mel-
bourne performance of the “ Mikado” until the Japanese
potentate made his entrance. Then he woke up, and
asked in a large, husky voice : “ Who’s’im?” His mate
replied in a whisper: “The Emperor of Japan.” Then
the drinky bushman got up on two unsteady legs : “ Wot?
The Emp’rer of Japan ? The bloke as licked the bloomin’
Chows. Hooray ! Three bloomin’ cheers for the F.tnp t., ;
Hooray! Let’s drink his bloomin’ health, l.uo —”
Just here a policeman helped him out.
A certain very peaceful-looking actor, rather well-known
in Australia and now located, Tub Bulletin believes, in
Melbourne, is reputed among his intimates to be a can-
nibal. The unreliable legend goes that he was ship-
wrecked in boyhood, and floated about in a boat with six
others until they grew mad with hunger. Then they
killed the fattest man of the party, and lived on him
till they were picked up. And now, it is said on bad
authority, that actor-man feels a desire for human flesh
every full moon, and sometimes when he is worse than
usual he will leave his dinner and rush out because he
wants man, and the sight of any other meat drives him
frantic.
X.Z. ; “Australia’s contribution to European theatres.
Victoria has sent Nellie Melba, Frances Saville (Fanny
Simonsen), Ada Crossley, Minna Fischer, Mrs. Bethell,
Marie Elster, Lalla Miranda, Mary Boucicault, Nellie
Stewart, Gertrude Jerrard, Ethel Haydon, Mabel Lane,
Grace and Alice Dudley, Pattie Browne, May Yoh6, Ada
Holcombe, Maud Hobson, Johann Kruse, Robert and
Roland Cunningham, Edward Morton, James Wood,
Gladstone Wright, Harry Atkinson Fitts, Ernest Hutchison
and Percy Grainger. N.S. Wales, amongst others, sent
Emilie Wood, Maud Fitz-Stubbs, Maud McCarthy and
Haddon Chambers. Queensland sent Elsie Hall. Maori-
land sent Johnnie Lemmone, George Clutsam, Harry
Stockwell and Tom Jackson ; and Tasmania contributed
Amy Sherwin. Also, Australia can claim Cynthia Brooke,
Sophie Harris, and many other minor luminaries.”
Mrs. Patrick Campbell’s Juliet, universally slated by the
critics, is a popular hit.
A well-known actress takes her bath with her diamonds
on, because she is so accustomed to have them in soak.
A Collins-street (Melb.) photographer shows the whole
Melb. Liedertafel in one gulp. Magnificent musical
mediocre mass.
Wicked Old Man : “ The Flegeltaub has more expression
in her shoulder-blades that there is in Katisha’s whole
elbow. Her liquid eyes are the faintest degree askew, the
kind that glance round a corner, with an expression
always destructive amid the men. Her palish face, with
sharp, peaky nose, may not be expressive till viewed
through a lorgnette, and then it is tantalising, especially
from the limpidity of the eyes, the rather largish mouth,
moist lips, and a general suffusion of not too pronounced
animalism. Juliet’s face makes everybody drivel just like
this.”
Miss Flo. Wilton, the imported lady for Coppin’s next
panto., reached Melbourne last week. She was recom-
mended in glowing terms to Coppin by Billee Barlow, of
the never-to-be-forgotten tights.
Fifty years ago an Irishman was charged at Melbourne
police-court with heaving a large, unripe apple at George
Coppin whilst that popular young comedian was singing
“ Billy Barlow.” The culprit put in a very good defence.
He was tipsy at the time, he said, and, seeing other people
fling things on the stage, he thought a fruit-offering
would be acceptable. Pined five shillings. The law is
conservative in its scale of fines. An Irishman commit-
ting the same indiscretion to-day would be sentenced to
the same old five “ bob.”
The Xmas show at Melb. Princess’s seems to be develop-
ing further comic-opera tendencies as time goes on.
Flora Graupner is in the cast along With Lauri and Flo.
Young, and Leonore Orelli’s part is mainly musical.
Martin Simonsen is storming the Vic. provinces with a
jagged opera co., and way back in the wheat districts,
where “ Maritana ” and “ Girofle-Girofla ” count as latest
novelties from Europe, the dread invader sets ’em up
again at prices to suit the times—two shillings and one,
especially the latter. Son Jules, “the greatest Aus-
tralian tenor,” heads the bill.
Poor old Charles Hall 6, now gone the way of all con-
ductors, was a real good fellow, and many stories are told
of his kindness, writes The Bulletin’s London correspon-
dent. In Salford one Christmas time he came across a
postman on his rounds who had been shouted for by the
people on his beat not wisely but too well, and was in a
profound state of obfuscation. Hallii took the man to his
house, told him to lie down and sleep for an hour or two,
and then set out and, in the fullness of his benevolent
heart, delivered the letters himself.
There was a scene at a Southern railway-station re-
cently in connection with the departure of the remnants
of a variety co. Several of the performers were left be-
hind owing to money troubles, and the “ proprietor,” who
was trying to get on the train, was the centre of an angry
throng. The bass violin man was uttering fearful
language, and the light tenor grabbed the manager’s
luggage and threatened to hit him on the head with it
(and it contained all the jokes, too) unless his £2 ss. was
paid at once. Finally the luggage, consisting of one pair
of tights, a new burlesque, one pair of pyjamas and a
bottle of beer, was left behind to be apportioned among
the crowd. The trombone man grabbed the beer, the
bass violin man received the tights, and a lady skirt-
dancer had to be content with the pyjamas. No one went
within a hundred yards of the burlesque.
The bouncing Lilian Tree got unkind notices for her
London debut in Wagnerian opera. One heartless wretch
said that she sang indifferently, and was not physically
qualified for her part. Lilian is running to flesh, The
Bulletin fears. She was somewhat of a full-blown budlet
before she left Australia.

Imperious Fashion
Ordains that the summer season of 1895 is ended.
Social life, no less than climatological phenomena,
marks the changes of the seasons, .The winter
season is Fashion’s Carnival; the summer its
period of comparative respite. The autumn and
winter seasons are the periods for indoor merry-
makings, festivities and functions, all of which
necessitate much more “ dressing (speaking
technically) than the out-of-door recreations of the
hot months. Howbe.it, each change of season
brings its monster “clearing sales.” Surplus
stocks must be quitted to make room for the new
importations. This is the occasion of the startling
bargains now obtainable at Manning and Co. s,
Oollins-street, Melbourne. The cream of this
fashionable firm’s stock of Millinery Costumes,
Fancy Dresses, Silks, &c., &0., is now being posi-
tively sacrificed to make room for new goods.
Ladies who cannot call in person are invited to
forward orders by post with a full description of
the goods they require. All favors by post, from
any part of Australasia, meet with the promptest
attention of Manning & Co., on the Block,
Ooliins-street, Melbourne. *
Australian Native Association.
Wb come across this heading very often when
perusing the leading dailies, and understood that
it was an association of the aboriginals of Aus-
tralia to get-um more beer and ’bacca from the
various Governments ; but on enquiry find that it
is an association of native-born white people,
formed with an object of forwarding their interests.
We can give all native as well as imported Aus-
tralians an object to gain and congratulate them-
selves over when we tell them that the famous
B. L. Corto Rothschild Cigar is now obtainable
at all first-class tobacconists for - fid. If you have
never tried them do so at once ; they are the same
as supplied to the f a'uous baron. Ask for the

Sydney,
December 17, 1895.
Mr Dear Moorabinda—•
The society item of the week was the production
at Sydney Criterion, last Thursday, of a comic
operetta, “ Club Life,” words by “ Banjo ” Pater-
son, music by Ernest Truman, A.C.O. There was
a crowded society house, and the presence of so
much Pure Merino made the dress-circle very hot.
Gov. Hampden was railed off in the_ centre, and
wore a tolerant expression and a white gardenia
in his coat, and some of the suite were similarly
beflowered, which rather looked as if they had all
patronised the same tree. Lady Hampden was
not present, but Miss Brand was on view in mauve
silk with old lace bertha, and her two sisters in
white silk. The V.R. enclosure was made festive
with a huge basket of flowers tied with Australian
blue ribbons, set there for His Excellency to yawn
behind, I suppose. All Darling and Potts Points
were on top in purple and fine linen—with
emphasis on the linen, so far as the men were con-
cerned. One scion of a legal family, deposited
prominently in the front row, had a most buxom
shirt-front which billowed out over his chest in a
manner that gave him a better bust than any dis-
played by the ladies in his party. He was indeed
a sort of object-lesson as to how a fat _ woman
would be likely to look above the belt in male
evening-dress.
From what I could hear of the operetta it
seemed rather promising. Some of the music
was lively, especially “ Oh, ’tis merry when lovers
meet,” “ The Butler’s Song,” “ The Saveloy ” duet
and dance, and the “Society Manners” finale.
The same kind remark applies to the song, “ All
things come to the man who waits ; ” nearly all
the choruses, and especially “ If you don’t love the
lasses then you’re no son of mine,” the “ Alas, for
poor humanity,” duet, and one or two more.
There were a good many, not exactly plums, so
let us say currants, in the operetta, which only
wants a little professional straightening up, the
“story” more accentuated, and a larger supply
of dialogue to be an amusing show. At least, that
is my foggy impression ; but it is difficult to size
up a play so indifferently presented as “ Club
Life ” was. Hardly a line of the book could be
heard in the circle. One gathered the argument
from the programme. The members of the Casso-
wary Club decide to have waitresses in place of
waiters, and society girls disguise themselves and
apply for billets in the hope of getting husbands
out of the deal. One maiden (the heroine, Mabel)
is engaged to a member (Freddy), but parted by a
proud papa, and her amourette supplies what
story there is. In the end a Govt, billet is heaped
on Freddy, who marries Mabel; the waitresses
reveal their true lineage ; the club admits them as
members, and the curtain drops.
There isn’t much the matter with the yarn, but
words fail to express what it looked like from the
front. All the actors and actresses (with the
exception of Mr. Whir) were society amateurs of
the aggravated variety, and it was quite instruc-
tive to see how many damsels who occupy the
front row in society are only fitted to fill the back
row of the chorus when the footlights are in ques-
tion. They certainly looked very smart and
stylish in white linen skirts and Eton jackets
with scarlet vests, white linen collars, hair poudre
and big-buckle shoes. As a parade of local young
ladyhood they were simply immense ; as an
operatic chorus they lacked many things, and
when one of them tottered out in obviously tight
shoes, with an expression of corn-fed agony on her
face, and began in a terrified “ I-shall-cry-m-a-
minute-girls ” sort of voice to chant what might
have been a rattling sort of song, and then
tottered back again, the audience knew what lay
before it.
“ Mabel Valentine ” (heroine) was the brightest
vocalist of the lot, but she over-acted and dressed
badly, and her dancing was a series of elementary
bumps. “Clara Valentine” looked winsome m
white satin brocade and large white plumed hat
(I must say the dressing was excellent on the
whole), and her ballad, “ 0 ’tis merry when lovers
meet,” was artistically sung in a small, sweet
voice, and her encore was the most genuine of all,
though it was a friendly gathering that encored
everything. Clever Miss Winnie Austin sang in
a small voice that required superhuman ears to
catch, but her acting was piquant, and she looked
very pretty, , , , ,
Mr. W. F. Hinchcliffe, R.N., as the butler, had
the best male voice, and bore up admirably against
many trials ; his singing was capita,!, and ms
dancing, a la Gaiety, was very bright. Mr.
Gibson was vocally inaudible as Sir Frederick
Pottspoint. Mr. Geo. Clibborn gave a crisp
sketch of a waiter who gets into Parliament on
the Labor-ticket, and Captain Dangar, as the
secretary, looked like a cash-fielder in a huge
black moustache, and had a walking part. Judged
as a performance the whole thmg might have got
off under the First Offenders Act if it hadn t been
for the orchestra led by the composer himself. A
good composer is not necessarily a »rood cooduc or.
and the way that orchestra wobbled in a weak,
apologetic manner two bars ahead or behind the
people on the stage, occasionally leaving off alto-
gether to wipe the perspiration off its brow while
the hapless singers were left totally unsupported
on the wild high C, was a novelty in musical
experiences, anyhow. My opinion of the whole
thing is that I want to see “ Club Life ” inter-
preted by a smart, tuneful cast and a competent
orchestra with its fiddlers in tune, before sitting
in judgment upon it.
Sydney Amateur Orchestral Society gave its
last concert of the season ’95 the other Wednesday
at Sydney Town Hall. Little pamphlets—wisely
distributed after the show so as not to spoil
people’s appetites, for there’s nothing so depressing
as being conscious that one’s entertainers are work-
ing a dead horse —drew attention to the society’s
impecuniosity, and to the fact that unless the
“ subscribers ” paid up the society would have to
melt its badges into old iron and retire into private
life. It is not good biz., however, to make these
dreadful announcements by circular. A long,
thin president or something standing up in a
death-like pause and remarking in hollow tones
that : “Ladies and gentlemen, ruin stares us in
the face ” —pointing meanwhile a meaning fore-
finger at the most unreceipted subscriber of the
lot, is much more effective in a young country.
However, I hope people will pay up, for the
Orchestra is only now budding into something like
proficiency, and it always plays good music. Per-
haps if there was more “ Ta-ra-ra ” and less
“Tannhauser” in its methods, Hazon wouldn’t
now be waving his baton on board wages as it
were.
The last concert was not very, thickly attended
and the dressing was depressing—mainly consist-
ing of fat women in light colors holding round,
red, hard-boiled-looking fans tight up against their
billowing chests, like targets in a shooting-gallery,
and there was no gubernatorial interest in the
front row. There were no ferns on the platform
for the last concert of the series—which rather
looks as if S.A.O.S. stands for “Small Ankles
Only Staged.” Verdure is usually called in to
hide big feet. But, taking a line from the ten-
tacles of some fiddleresses, there is no fear of
seeing any of ’em Bloomering on bikes if what a
wicked man once told me —that you can judge of
a girl’s lower limbs by her wrist and arm —is to be
relied upon. But the music was good. Apart
from the orchestral numbers, Edith King, in pink
and blue, fought a brave fight with the Town Hall
echo ; Rivers Allpress played a dreamy solo with
great effect, and Strauss got in a ’cello solo—an
old Jewish tune, unabridged, that sounded like
the wail of Ikey Mo watching the favorite winning
all the way, so that it must have been an artistic
rendering. “ Ruy Bias ” ( not by Meyer Lutz) and
part of the Eroica symphony, were the main
orchestral dishes, but the most seasonable thing
not mentioned on the programme was Hazon’s
bow, which suggested a timid man putting his
head under a pump.
W. H. Paling and Co.’s Xmas Annual ’95
(13th number), comes forth with a good photo, of
Maud Hobson as Lady Virginia on its gay and
festive cover, and Maggie Moore’s rollicking song,
“ Molly Riley 0,” as chief attraction inside.
There are 16 numbers in the annual which, though
it doesn’t contain any classics, gives you “ Sweet
Marie,” “Good Rhine Wine,” “Ben Bolt” (as
sung by Little Billee), and a host of other popular
things for the insignificant amount of one shilling.
From the same firm comes a gavotte, “ T’Amo
Assai,” by G. Podenzana, and “The Daffodil
Waltz,” by Philip H- Mohr. The gavotte hasn’t
sufficient motive, and the whole thing impresses
you as being so anxious not to be like something
of Sullivan’s that it quite forgets that a tune is
necessary. “ The Daffodil ”is badly named —the
title is too namby-pamby for this dashing, sparkle-
some dance-tune, which takes strong wrists to do
full justice to its exhilarating chords.
Mdlle. Trebelli’s second concert at Sydney Cen-
tenary Hall, last Friday, was V.R. Lady Hamp-
den in black vestments, with a black bow and a
flame-color aigrette as her inevitable head-dress,
had the worst seat in the house, as usual, right
under the singers’ noses. She was accompanied
by two daughters, dressed in water-ice colors, and
the regular basket of flowers (managerial) com-
pleted the V.R. staging. There was a good
attendance, but the dressing in the reserved places
set my teeth on edge. First, a diamond dagger
and a bare neck, and then a bonnet and a linen
collar cheek by jowl alongside of it, positively
jolted my sense of fitness.
If Mdlle. Trebelli (good name for a soprano,
isn’t it ?) had warbled with her hands behind her
back she might have posed for Trilby. She wore
her dark hair parted in the middle, with a tricky
little row of diamonds on either side. Only the
young and blooming can afford to part their hair
like that. What looks like a mere bridle-track
across a young woman’s head turns to a regular
stock-route on the middle-aged. Her gown was
pale-blue satin with lines of gold passementerie,
and she blazed with Paris diamonds. Mdlle. T.
has a free, high, large soprano voice, under perfect
control, and the penalty she paid for her tuneful-
ness was that her four solos, including the jewel
song (Gounod) and “Oh ! Quand je dors ” (Liszt),
were lengthened into eight. Besides being a cul-
tivated vocalist, Mdlle. has the virtue of intro-
ducing songs new to Australian concert-goers,
especially in her encores ; and she is well supported
and diversified by Mr. Pianissimo Weir (tenor),
W. T. Barker, the clever Melbourne harpist, and
pianist Beaupuis, of the tossing mane. J. Edward
Sykes manages the Sydney season.
The members of the St. John’s Ambulance
League (grafted on to Australia by the first Lady
Brassey, and foster-mothered in Sydney by little
Lady Carington) held their annual war-dance at
Sydney Town Hall last Saturday afternoon, with
Lady Hampden to give the medals and stimcates
and a loud brass band kicking up its heels in the
eastern gallery. There was not a huge attendance,
and the occasion had no sartorial significance.
Lady Hampden wore a simple steel-grey crepqn,
with white belt, collar, and cuffs, black-and - pniß
bonnet, fawn suede gloves, and a pink rose in her
buttonhole. Her Excellency is neither a speech-
maker nor a speech-taker, for while the chairman
mumbled some statistics, she carried on an
animated chat with Bishop S. Smith (no relation
of mine, remember), whose well-filled gaiters were
quite a feature of the platform.
Lady Hampden is not a potentatess of the
Universal Pumphandling variety. She gave the
medals and things to both men and women with
a few “ well-chosen,” inaudible remarks and a
honeyed smile, but the usual spasmodic hand-
shake was left out of the bill—to the recipients
great relief, I have no doubt. Even as it was,
some of them seemed to have great difficulty in
getting off the platform alive, and one of the
amateur first-aiders (a man), who got a medal,
kicked Miss Brand’s white parasol half-a-yard in
his struggles to get away, and never thought of
apologising, but left the lady to grab her property
for herself. The prettiest part of the ceremony
was when Lady H. pinned the order of St. John
of Jerusalem on to the collar of the athletic Dr.
Reuter Roth, while the audience whacked the
floor with its umbrella. The private secretary, in
white spats, accompanied the vice-regal party, and
the usual committee basket of flowers did its best
to trip everybody up. The giving of that basket
was amusing. A committee-lady poked it under
Lady tf.Vuo.se at the wrong moment, just as she
was talking to the League’s pocket-Providence,
Dr. Vandaleur Kelly, and when, at length, her
Excellency turned to dutifully gush over the
flowers (what a lot of floral superlatives a
Governor’s wife must use in a busy week !) the
committee lady had fled, leaving her Ex. to pour
out her delight to empty air !
The most-stared-at individual on the platform
was the third bride of a hoary politician who was
there too, leaning heavily and picturesquely on a
stick, though I always understood that a young
wife did away with the necessity for a staff. The
latest addition to the ranks of local nobility wore
grey and pink like a rosy cockatoo, and her hat
was wonderfully trimmed with feathers.
At Sydney; Lyceum Miss Dauvray closed her
so-so season last Saturday with “One of Our
Girls ” and the second act of “ Our Boys.” “ One
of Our Girls ” is a charming play, and the dressing
on Saturday was quite en suite. Miss Dauvray,
as Kitty, wore a cool-looking creamy silk dress
with lace insertion for the first act, and Miss
Nobte, as Julie, was innocence itself in white
muslin with weak little flounces. I have often
noticed that stage-innocence never knows exactly
how to dress. Kitty’s pink satin and chiffon with
gold sequins and her handsome wrap had a good
show in the 2nd act, and Julie wore yellow brocade.
Indeed, the only discordant note in the whole en-
joyable play was the bald spot on top of the
gallant “ cap ting.” Surely he could have trained
a bit of crape hair over it ? In “ Our Boys ” the
most amusing thing was King Hedley’s get-up
d la Chief Justice Darley. Among the Lyceum
audience was Miss Elsie Cameron in a wonderful
toque and a pink-silk blouse, accompanied by her
husband, Mr. J. S. Cowell. They are en route for
Bananaland.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH

Moral —careful scientific breeding.
A Maoriland labourer, whose humpy had
been robbed on three occasions while he was away
at work, fixed up an elaborate man-trap with a
gun attached and waited results. Four days
later, when he came home, he found the result
in the shape of a highly respectable neighbour
lying dead on the stair. The ingenious person
arrested on a charge of murder, and got two
years for exercising the right to set man-traps on
his own premises.
The other day a Mrs. Trenchard, of Guild-
ford (N.S.W.), gave herself up to the police for
killing her husband in self-defence with an axe,
the husband being a fiend who bit and kicked and
otherwise ill-used her and horribly ill-treated the
children. Then Sydney Telegraph described
her as “a heart-broken, wild-looking creature,
who seemed hardly to understand her position ...
she seemed listless and almost unconcerned.” The
Herald also said that she was “ a quiet, heart-
broken-looking creature.” Next day it was
alleged at the inquest that Trenchard was a mild,
hard-working man, that his wife sometimes
drank heavily, and that instead of being
killed in self-defence the old man had been
butchered in his sleep. The Herald wisely
dropped the matter there, but the Telegraph
repented of its former description, and stated that
Mrs. Trenchard was “ a spare woman, with a hard
mouth, large eyes, and emotionless face.” The
point of view makes all the difference. When the
average man hears that somebody has committed
atl awful axe-butchery he immediately finds that
the accused looks just like the person who would
have done that sort of thing. And if the same
individual is alleged to be a martyred saint he, or
she, always looks that way also. Anyhow, the
second description could have been condensed a
lot. “ She looks like a woman who habitually
kept a boarding-house” would have covered every-
thing.
The Dean “Conspiracy.”
Now that VV. P. Chick has been acquitted of
all share in the Dean “ conspiracy,” almost
everybody in the community is anxious to
know on what possible grounds he was ever
dragged into the case. The Crown did not
produce one shred of really direct evidence
against him, and hardly any that could be
called even moderately indirect, and, consider-
ing the vigor with which the prosecution was
conducted, the public naturally takes this to
mean that no evidence of any value was avail-
able. Not one among the multitude of Crown
witnesses alleged that Crick had spoken
anything, or written anything, or done
anything which bore any real semblance of
conspiracy, and even the police who searched
his office and ransacked his papers failed to
find one incriminatory document. The jury
distinctly expressed its opinion as to the utler
futility of the charge against Crick by
acquitting him, apart from ihe other prisoners,
without waiting for the Judge’s summing up,
which evidently implied that it regarded his
case as beyond all argument. Also, the Judge
fully concurred in the acquittal, though the
Crown’s representative opposed it most vigor-
ously. Yet the Crown tlid not simply serve
Crick with a summons, as is generally done in
trivial cases, when the accused is a person
whom no one could reasonably suspect of an
intention to run away, though considering the
case it produced against him, or rather didn t
produce against him, even a summons would
have seemed hardly justifiable. Instead, it
arrested him, and at the Police Court the
Crown, or someone who purported to act
on its behalf and whose act was never repudi-
ated, made a great effort to prevent the grant-
ing of bail. If it had been successful in this
respect Crick would have lain in gaol for
weeks awaiting his trial, arid the consequent
loss of practice would probably have ruined
him. Also, he was put to great trouble,
anxiety and expense ; his practice of necessity
suffered severely ; and he was confined for two
weeks during the progress of the trial. The
fact that the Government which instituted this
extraordinary case, and pursued it in such a
remarkable fashion, was one to which Crick
has been always politically opposed, and con-
cerning which he has used much aggressive
language, makes the circumstances all the more
unfortunate. Botaiiy Bay justice has had in-
numerable slurs cast upon it of late, and it
can’t very well afford to give even a semblance
of excuse for further obloquy.
Richard Speight has resolved to carry his
endless case against Syme to the Privy Council.
Speight has more fight in him than a bull-ant,
and if his funds only permit, his case will last
Syme’s lifetime and be handed down to his
descendants.
Having simultaneously reached its first
anniversary and its first libel-action, Sydney
Licensing Guardian celebrates both events by
appearing in an improved form with a colored
cover, and is now a neat and rather interesting
little publication.
No doubt people have lately noticed a
reflection in the western sky (writes “ Blaok-
swanalian ”to The Bulletin). Albert F. Calvert
has come. His “fourth tour” of Westralia has
begun, and the objects thereof are announced in
flaring headlines and a three-col. interview in a
local paper. The young man is about to splash on
a scale never before attempted. Bursting with
mighty schemes for the booming of W.A., and
conscious that the man who arrives like a comet
has bigger chances than he who enters unobtru-
sively by the back-door, Mr. Calvert called out a
special train from Albany to Perth, although he
might, by waiting a little while, have travelled
almost as quickly by the ordinary express. He
explained to the interviewer, who was curious why
so great a man should travel by ordinary P. & O.
steamer, that he had no time to wait for the com-
pletion of his steam-yacht. Then as to his
schemes. The Govt, is to be asked to establish a
kind of W.A. exhibition in London; cost
.£20,000, of which Mr. Calvert will supply
half. There is to be a W.A. general infor-
mation bureau in London, which he will run
for a year gratis just for the fun of the thing,
resigning all business appointments “ in order to
have a free hand to run the agency for all it is
worth ; ” also, he will guarantee the Govt, against
loss for the first year, or longer if necessary.
Next, he will —also at his own expense—send out
an exploring party “to complete the task which
the Elder expedition was sent out for and failed
to accomplish.” He will present W.A. with the
nucleus of a national portrait-gallery and assist
in providing the requisite building if necessary.
Finally, he has named one of his racers “ Westra-
lian,” and he has a list of other local names ready
for his mokes to carry to the honor and glory and
advt. of W.A. as his racing career progresses !
Naturally, he has-been received in the West as
every visitor is received from whose every pore
sovereigns ooze and in whose wake is a trail of
champagne-bottles. Now, what is to be done
with A. F. Calvert ? So far, every man in
Westralia professes to “ see right through him.”
They scoff at his exploring feats, and when he is
dined and given costly presents they laugh in their
sleeves and dig one another in the ribs. But he
will advertise the province, say they. A river of
British capital will flow in his wake. And so he
gyrates through the province as its privileged
and hall-marked guest. And for the present, not-
withstanding that his liege subjects profess to re-
gard him as a gilded guy, he is king of W.A. It
is indeed difficult to withhold some sort of admira-
tion for a man who can become an explorer with-
out exploring, who can harness a Lord Mayor and
all manner of small fry eminent in the boom-
world to his chariot, who can manoeuvre so that
the hundreds who deride him in secret assist in
public to hoist him on high. Westralia is badly
Calvert-bitten, but as yet the symptoms are latent

The project for making the chief civic
printer or draper of Sydney a Lord Mayor is the
sort of thing which will prevent any person with a
sense of humor from taking the mayoral billet in
future. The mediaeval lord saved himself from
becoming wholly ridiculous by wearing a suit of
armour and sticking a spear through anybody who
criticised him too much. He might be no better
than any other man, but as he was in a position to
drop heavily on the person who said so he at least
kept up a semblance of importance. The modern
lord, when he is criticised by small boys in the
street, must either walk away rapidly, or run after
the small boys with a walking-stick, or call for a
large Irish policeman. And the modem lord
mayor, who is a kind of bogus temporary lord that
sells slop clothing or wire nails, is a mixture of
nothing in particular—a sort of imitation peer
who bosses the corporation rubbish-tip and argues
over drainage contracts, and when the small
newspaper boy asks him where he got that hat he
has no ancestral pride to fall back upon. The
hardest thing in all this world to keep up is a
dignity that isn’t big enough to help to keep itself
up, and which has to be held up by main force all
the time.

The other day, at St. Kilda, Governor
Brassey was confronted by a dusty man in broken
boots and an infamous hat. “ Gould you give a
feller a job?” asked the stranger, abruptly. “I
am afraid not, my man,” said his Excellency ; “ I
am not an employer.” “Oh, I jes’ thought I’d
ask you,” said the shabby man, wearily, “ seein’
I’d asked every other man in Melbourne.”
• ♦ • •
Lady Brassey is playing Lady Bountiful in
Melbourne, regardless of expense. You appeal to
a man’s heart through his stomach ; her Ladyship
appeals to the women’s hearts through the
stomachs of their children. She is picnicking and
feasting the State school scholars of Melbourne in
a most lavish manner, and every second youngster
in the suburbs has by this time acquired an inward
pain, induced by the liberality of “me lady.” A
special excursion and particular gorge have been
arranged for those children who sang “ God Save
the Queen ” at their Excellencies on the occasion
of the famous landing at St. Kilda. The I'rasscys
evidently recognise the fact that tin poor
“ kiddies” were not to blama for that discordant
grovel.

N.S.W. Gov. Hampden is said to have a
deadly loathinv of th~ well-meaning noodles who
make it their aim in life to turn the conversation
round the vice-regal mahogany to “ John Hamp-
den, ye know, me hid, your illustrious ancestor
who fell at Chalgrove Field.” It is a dreadful
thing to have only one middling great ancestor,
and to be always hearing of him, especially when
you aren’t dead-sure that he is your ancestor after
all.

Justice wasn’t leaden-footed, the other
day, in Dunedin (M.L.). On the 3rd inst. a man
and woman were “pulled” before the S.M. for
theft of a watch and chain. He was discharged,
and she was committed for trial. In another por-
tion of the courthouse the Grand J ury was sitting
on the Supreme Court list; Maggie Buckingham’s
case was included therein from the lower court;
the influential citizens found a true bill; case
came on in the afternoon, the jury found the
prisoner guilty, and the Judge sent her up for
four years—all on the 3rd of December. If it had
only been a capital case and she had been hanged
in the evening, everything w uld have been com-
plete.
The Victorians have
already decided that
Baron Brassey is a slow
and leadeh speaker and
very painful to listen
to. He clears his throat
perpetually, and says

Melb. pressmen,
especially the free-lances,
live to a great extent
in these bad times by
writing sermons. The
most unctuous and im-
pressive kind of sermon
is generally supplied by
the broken-down “ hard
case ” of the press, who
has had large experi-
ence in spreading ii ini-
self in re the Yarra
corpse and other similar
topics. This works a
congenial note of sad-
ness into his writings
which is very effective
when delivered in the
regulation parsonical
tone of woe. About
the hardest-looking ob-
ject among Vic. press-
men makes his food and
liquor now mostly by
writing sermons for a
very prominent clergy-
man, and his discourses fill the tabernacle
regularly.

The cablegrammsr sends out the thrilling
news that Brassey’s brother’s eye, which was
blackened at a tennis match, has been examined
by a doctor, and proves not so bad as was sup-
posed. Hardly anyone at this end knew that
there was anything wrong with Brassey’s brother’s
eye, or that Brassey had a brother, or that the
brother had an eye, and it is truly sickening to
think that because Brassey is the vice-regal figure-
head of one extreme corner of this continent, all
Australasia is required to read about the eye of
his little brother at “ ’Ome.” This country agreed
to endure Brassey on certain fixed conditions, but
his brother’s eye wasn’t in the contract.

At a recent Adelaide Criminal Sessions,
out of 20 cases there were 19 convictions and one
nolle prosequi —a record'performance. This is
described by the local press as “a credit to the
Crown Law Department,” and “to his Honor the
Chief Justice, owing to the remarkable clearness
with which he put the cases to the juries.” And
not a word is said about the co-operation of these
19 prisoners in being so unanimously guilty. Yet,
unless it is implied that some of them were inno-
cent, and were wrongly convicted owing to the
vigor of the Crown Law Department and the
remarkable clearness of his Honor, they had more
to do with the creditable proceeding than any-
body else.
Christ Church, South Yarra, is the athletic
church of Melbourne ; there the regular attendant
is a muscular Ker.st an, with a penchant for box-
ing exercise, and the ladies of the choir mostly
have powerful biceps and bulbous calves, and
many of them are artists on the flying-trapeze and
at ground and lofty gymnastics. 'Recently, the
vicar arranged a church-parade on bicycles, which
he hoped would be of a “solemn and dignified
character.” As if it were possible for the shaven
elder or the good young man in the black suit to
look dignified on a b.ke ! However, the great
object ot the demonstration is to prove that Christ
Church, South Yarra, is mov.ng with the times —

that this church will prove that it has legs to stand

A story comes from Ballarat (Vic.) of the
wife of a local councillor who yawned so pro-
digously in church on a recent Sunday that she
badly dislocaled her jaw, and had to be hurried
away to the h ispital in a cab. Thus far there is
an air of simple truth about the narrative that is
pleasing ; the only remarkable circumstance is that
such accidents are so rare in church. Arrived at
the hospital-gates, the lady was being assisted to
alight when the cabman’s horse moved and she
was thrown into the road. When she was picked
up she was found to have cut her forehead, but the
dislocation had been put right by the violent con-
cussing of the jaw against the gutter.

Knocking about the corridors of the
largest wooden building in the world (the Wel-
lington Government offices, Maoriland) may be
s :en many a face which was well-known in the
roaring West Coast days of the 70’s, and
digger Dick Seddon always nods to these
pathetic wrecks as he passes by.
Amongst them may be quoted a
typical case. He was worth thou-
sands per annum in his Westland
flush days. Then he came down
with the times, drifted to the
Sydney Domain, doing nightly
perishes and daily starvings.
Premier Seddon heard of his
fallen lines, sent for him, put
a suit of clothes on his back,
filled him with good victuals—
and then fixed him up in a
billet among the johnnies in
the largest wooden building in
the world. Premier Dick’s
old-time friends have an air
of the bush and the billy
about them, and they
are mostly an-
cient and rather
out-of-date, and
the old digger
and the new

harmonise any

still things go

caught fire. The
train was stopped
and some time spent
in extinguishing tho
conflagration. In
consequence, another
train, in which Lady
Brassey and the bishop of Melbourne were
riding, was delayed for 20 minutes. Some
grovelling persons have since been bursting
with indignation because the railway officials did
not move the first train on to a siding before mak-
ing efforts to put the fire out, despite the fact that
the delay would have given time for the whole
train to get ablaze. Melbourne has got the grove]
complaint very badly this time.

Dear Bulletin, —You notice a letter of
effusive thanks from the Brasseys to the St. Kilda
woman who sent them a dish of peas. I have met
a gentleman who wrote a slab of nautical verse,
with loyal allusions to “Me Lud ” and “Me
Lydy,” and who received a letter of thanks from
the grateful gubernator. Saving that reference is
made to a “ poem ” instead of peas, his letter is
identical with that exhibited by the generous

O’er moonlit waves we float along,
Watching the shore lights gliding by ;
Across the water comes a song,
Wild, sad, and sweet! A little sigh,
Begotten in that region strange—
The mystic marge ’twixt smiles and tears—
Flutters the soft breast ’gainst my arm ;
Encircled by your dark eyas’ charm
1 wish the moments might be years !
We drift along unseen—unheard—
O’er waters scarcely ripple-stirred ;
Would we might float out far away
Oyer the ocean, lips and lips,
Till Idealh our light of love eclipse,
Then sleep—for ever and for aye !

The law arrived at one of its most remark-
able decisions in the Wilson (Melb.).
After a long investigation it decided that the hus-
band had been so utterly bad that, viewing his
conduct by itself, his wife was fairly entitled to a
divorce. Also, it resolved that the wife had been
so wicked that when she was considered separately
the husband had every possible right to a separa-
tion. And then, considering them jointly, it
decided that because both of them were entitled to
a divorce neither of them ought to have it. Also,
they couldn’t have it because they] both wanted it;
it only one of them had wanted it, it might have
been granted, but the fact that both wanted it was
fatal. The law apparently regards divorce, not as
relief to the person who wants it but as a punish-
ment to the one who objects to it, and however
much one of the parties may deserve it, unless the
other one kicks violently the 44 statoots ” view the
matter with grave suspicion. And when two
people have acquired such a solid and unanimous
loathing that the presence of each one incites the
other to sin and drink and to be a general blot on
society, then the law holds that they are just the
sort of people l who should be compelled to live and
wrangle together all their lives. It is_a weird and
woolly kind of logic, but the law is a curious
animal and isn’* built like anything else.

A citizen o± Onehunga (M.L.), where the
female mayors come from, came home one night
recently and found a male stranger on the pre-
mises under the sort of circumstances that the
Social Gimlet Society is interested in. His son
was along with him, and the pair took the law in
their own hands, and severely whaled the inter-
loper. Then they tore all his clothes off him, and
the old man went away to look-for a policeman,
taking the garments with him as a solid guarantee
that the stranger would not escape, and leaving
his son on guard. It was at this stage that things
began to go wrong. The undressed stranger
attacked the son, and after a dreadful conflict, in
which £5 worth of damage was done to the draw-
ing-room furniture, he laid Jhat person out. Then
he hurriedly dressed himself in the old man’s
Sunday clothes and belltopper, and ran for parts
unknown, and when the house-father came back
with a vast constable, all he found was general
wreckage and a dazed son sitting in the fireplace.

A Belfast journal—the Northern Whig—
is responsible for the following fairy-tale: “Sir
John Madden, Chief-Justice of Victoria, built
with his own hands the carriage in which he drives
to the law-courts, and the yacht in which he
cruises about the harbor at Melbourne on Satur-
day afternoons.” Madden, as it happens, doesn’t
drive to the law-courts in his kerridge, nor keep a
yacht for cruising purposes, also one glance at his
noble presence and his waxed mo suffices to con-
vince any ordinary observer that Madden would
prefer death itself to the job of constructing a
yacht or a barouche, even if he had learned how
to do those things. The story is headed ‘ 4 A Chief -
Justice who builds his own yacht.” It will in-
evitably lead to more paragraphs of a similar
nature. We live in hopes of hearing soon that
Madden has achieved a marble bridge across the
Yarra with his own fair hands.

At Hawthorn (Melb.) there is a Chinese

The curriculum comprises the English language
and the Bible. As a rule, however, the Chow,
being of the fish and vegetable variety, leaves after
the English lesson, that being all his sordid soul
sees any commercial value in. The Mission meets
every Sunday afternoon, and it is a coincidence
that although many differed Chows attend, there
are never more than sufficient to make one for

Brisbane Government House is very old
and mouldy, and has been long sinking
into decay. The horse-hair is sticking
out of the furniture, and the carpets
are faded and threadbare, and
there are grease-marks left by
the heads of many Governors
on the walls of the drawing-
room, and the floor is worn
into a channel with the feet
of many heavy premiers
coining in to arrange for an
extension of the Kanaka
traffic. The prospective ar-
rival of a fresh Gov., with
the varnish scarcely dry on
his title, has suddenly aroused
the Ministry to seriously con-
sider this ramshackle state of
things, and it has been decided
to refurnish the place through-
out before Lammgton arrives,
lest the chairs give out suddenly,
and the bright young potentate
comes down with a hard wallop
on the floor. The refurnishing will make a pretty
serious hole in Nelson’s surplus, by the way.

Dear Bulletin,
—Tacts for your at-
tention as a sample of
N.S.W. backblocks
justice. D.C. Judge
Gibson arrived in
Broken Hill on Wed-
nesday, Nov. 20, to
g reside at Quarter
essions. There being
no cases for trial, he
received the custom-
ary white gloves and
gave vent to the usual
nonsense about ab-
sence of local crime.
Next day a man was
charged in the Police
Court with commit-
ting criminal offences
upon girls under 14
years. He was com-
mitted to Wilcannia
Quarter Sessions, to
be held on Nov. 25.
He left Broken Hill
in custody on Nov.
23, arrived in Wil-
cannia next day(Sun-
day), and on Monday
morning was tried
and convicted, and
got seven years penal
servitude from J udge
Gibson aforesaid. In
this case, perhaps,
no miscarriage o f
justice occurred, but,
under similar circum-
stances, what chance
would an innocent
man have of defend-
ing himself ?—Yours,
Broken Hill.

A Victorian, who recently stole and
pawned the bassoon of the man next door, pleaded
in defence that he did it to abate a nuisance, the
adiacent person being an execrable and persistent
player who groaned and wheezed on his instrument
far into the night. Nevertheless, he got 14 days,
and the outlaw with the dreadful instrument gets
nothing. Some day, The Bulletin hopes, this
community will recognise that the bassoonist and
the trombonist are enemies of society, and will
decree that these instruments shall be played only
in the middle of a cleared space of 640 acres, and
then only after six days’notice, and in the presence
and under the supervision of the police, and by a
person bearing on him a £5 revenue stamp which
shall entitle him to play for one day only.

left in doubt as to whether the shark or Lady
Carington’s letter caused the “ terrible disaster.”

One Kate Hayes
put up a record last
week at Sydney by
getting herself ar-
rested for carrying off
a youth of 17, an un-
employed saddler, and
“wilfully marrying”
the same, well know-
ing that he was under
age, and without first
obtaining the consent
of his father. Whether
she also neglected to
obtain his own con-
sent and simply car-
ried off the stunted
infant by force of
arms doesn’t appear
for certain. Their
married life lasted
four days. Then the
bridegroom disap-
peared, having pro-
bably been seized by
his father in the street
and taken home, and
the bride was run in
for taking her hus-
band out of the con-
trol of his parents.
The spectacle of a
lady being charged
with stealing her hus-
band shows that the
New Woman is pro-
gressing. Also, this
strong demand for an
unemployed saddler
aged 17, with no chest
measurement worth
mentioning, suggests
that men are dread,
fully scarce just now-

The balance-sheet of the E.S. and A. Bank,
which is now to hand, throws very little new light on the
troubles of that embarrassed institution. The loss on the
year s operations is over £16,400. The gross takings
(£234,978) are £11,500 less for the complete year than they
were for the previous eleven months ; of this sum interest
on £168,687, and the expenses of manage-
ment (£82,723) more than swallow up the remainder. The
new deposits have increased slightly, but the total deposits
have declined ; capital has increased by £208,000; the
note issue shows a very large falling off, and the cash on
hand has been reduced by £145,000. The troubles of the
E.S. and A. are not caused by the great amount of un-
invested money on hand, for this item (£898,000) is com-
paratively moderate ; moreover, its holdings of State and
municipal securities now stand at £55,000 against £113,000
a year ago, so that it would appear to have been realising
its old investments instead of looking for new ones.
During the year £51,000 of terminable deposits have been
redeemed “ on terms advantageous to the bank,” but what
these terms may be like, or how much larger the loss
would have beep if they hadn’t been arrived at, do not
appear.
Ihe only thing which the balance-sheet shows
very definitely is that the E.S. and A., with a larger
capital than last year, less money lying idle, and £94,000
less fixed deposits to pay interest upon, has come out a
great deal worse than it did in ’94. The low rate of in-
terest is ascribed as the reason. Whether this heavy loss
of interest involves any serious loss of principal is a
matter of conjecture. Anyhow, the board seems to con-
template a probability of things becoming a great deal
worse than they are. In the last disastrous year it
earned 3J per cent, on its A 2,009,000 odd of inscribed
deposit stock, yet it asks for power to cut down the in-'
terest, if necessary, as low as U per cent., which will make
the average rate on all its old fixed deposits £2 11s. 6d.
per cent. This certainly looks as if the institution had
no very exuberant confidence in its own future just at
present.
If the E.S. and A. Bank gets through with its
new arrangement, it is rumored that one or two other
institutions, which are now leading a somewhat precarious
existence in the struggle to pay the reconstructed 4A per-
cent., may shortly follow its example. Three banks, at
all events, want a reduction of interest rather badly, and
one of them wants an extension of time as well; while
another desires to arrive at some arrangement whereby it
can pay off part of its deposits in advance, and thereby
reduce its outlay for interest and get rid of several tons of
gold which it dare not invest for fear they shouldn’t come
back in time. Another bank is reported to be making a
good part of its profits nowadays by buying up its own
depreciated deposit receipts—a device which should be
more widely adopted. Altogether, most of the recon-
struction schemes are out of date, and want to be put on
an entirely new footing.

Chaffey Bros., Limited, the great Mildura irri-
gation concern, is about to wind up with a possible
view to reconstruction, and the Vic. Government
is pushing through a Bill to make Mildura a self-
governing district under the control of a Water Trust.
The scheme was a luckless, ill-managed affair from the
beginning. The founders were so dead sure that all the
land would be taken up that, instead of selling the blocks
close to the river first, they allowed settlers to purchase
scattered selections anywhere and everywhere, and when
the intermediate land remained unsold the co. had to
make water-channels at great cost over long reaches of
vacant land to irrigate a few outlying settlers. The
channels were cheaply and inefficiently made, and the
water leaked away, and the irrigation was more or less
unsuccessful. Many of the orchards proved useless after
years of waiting, through the planting of worthless trees
by settlers who hardly knew one vegetable from another.
There was no railway, and water-carriage was difficult and
expensive. The wine-making industry was discouraged by
the curse of Prohibition and Cold Tea. The co. worked on
money borrowed in London at 5 per cent. The selectors
tell behind in their payments to the extent of some
£40,000. Cash became an unknown quantity at Mildura,
and the settlement degenerated into a region of barter,
discouragement and sly grog-shops. According to the
last balance-sheet, the co. had over, a,000,000 of liabilities,
no cash, and no assets except Mildura, which was fast
dropping to pieces. Finally, the dreadful Real Estate
Bank sued for two P N’s amounting to a miserable £4OO
which had been dishonored for over two years—apparently,
m all that time, Mildura, with over £1,000,000 of alleged
assets, hadn’t been able to raise £4OO cash and the luck-
less company, which has apparently ruined the Chaffeys
and most other people concerned, is going to close up.

1 he little National Bank of Tasmania reports a
net profit for the half-year, after paying income-tax, of
£3929, against £3790 last half, and £4524 the one pre-
viously. A 5 per cent, dividend absorbs £3BOl, and the
balance, with £1596 on hand from last year, makes £1724
carried forward. The National is a concern of 10 years’
standing, with £152,040 of capital and a moderate reserve
of £22,500, which might have been larger but for an
undue anxiety to pay 8 per cent, dividends in the early
years of its existence.

The Maoriland Midland Railway Co., whose
arbitration is now in progress, claims £1,817,900 and in-
terest from the M. L. Government. If it wins, therefore,
the account against the province will stand something
like this; Cash, £1,817,1400; interest, about £25,000;
land already granted to the co., 373,000 acres ; loss
through the locking-up for 10 years of 6,000,000 acres,
amount difficult to estimate ; legal expenses, probably a
good many thousands ; and a whole decade of worry,
anxiety, profanity, and hope deferred. And against all
this the sole assets will be 82 miles of railway in three dis-
connected scraps, which could have been built by the
State, with reasonable economy, for the value' of the land-
grant alone. As a disastrous lesson in land-grant railway-
construction, the Midland is a very large thing indeed.

The National Building, Land and Investment
Co. (Sydney) is going the way of Sydney building societies
in general. It proposes to reconstruct on the following
rather steep lines ; that all interest due on deposits at
31st December, ’95, shall accrue at present rates ; that no
interest whatever shall be payable from that date until
December, ’97, and thereafter it shall be payable at the
very humble rate of 2J per cent, per annum. The
principal is to fall due at no date in particular, but when-
ever sufficient cash is accumulated to pay 2s. in the £ the
amount is to be distributed among the patient depositors.
Also, the board wants authority to take deposit-receipts
m payment of land, which is eminently advisable ; and it
also wants power to pay off any deposit at any time “ on
terms to be mutually agreed upon ” which proviso seems
to open up such possibilities for some future board’s uncle
to get his money early that it. wants ia lot of Thinking over. 1

The Intercolonial Investment, Land and Build-
ing Go. (Sydney), oiie of the few concerns in that city
which have not taken refuge in reconstruction, reports a
profit for the year of £2651, and £2197 from last year
makes the amount available £4848. Of this £550 go to
reservo (making it £6250), £3OOO are written off the assets
to allow for depreciation and possible losses, and £1298
are carried forward. The Intercolonial hopes to resume
dividends shortly; meanwhile, it has an overdraft of
£3312, and land-values in the eastern provinces are still
falling, and the new land-tax will strike it witli a dull thud
in a few months, and its profits are mostly from the Wes-
tralian business, where the boom may get spinal paralysis
at any time, and therefore it proposes to go slow.

In the last 23 weeks the earnings of the
Victorian railways have fallen £56,524 below last

little produce to carry, owing to the drought, that the

The N.S.W. railways, which were doing well
during the first half of this year, have suddenly begun to
mie up a promising' deficit. Last week’s returns, were
£16,610 below those of the corresponding week of ’94.
Melbourne soft-goods importers have been busy
of late, exporting their rotten old woollen stuffs to branch
houses in other provinces (say W.A.) for the sake of the
“drawback,” which will suffer a fall of 10 per cent, on
January 1. The 40 per cent. “ drawback ” claimed from
the Government on account of these aged, obsolete
materials exceeds, in many cases, their market value ;
also in many cases, where the invoices are shockingly un-
truthful, it exceeds the original cost, including duty. A
professional Freetrader doesn’t reveal the trade tricks
with which his importing friends rob the country, even if
he be quite alive to the swindle, and so the wholesale
rogues wax fraudulently fat.

,N.S. W. Judge Manning’s suggestion that the Eng-

an unwarrantable piece of provincial impudence. The

Britishers are entitled to any sort of “ confidence ” they
can derive from a liquidator of their own. They want an

Inspector Slee on the Young O’Brien mine at
Grenfell, N.S.W. : “ This yield -3460 z. from 840 tons
though not up to expectation is nevertheless payable, the
reef being several feet in thickness. The water for crush-
ing purposes being very dirty, perhaps the concentrates
will contain a higher yield of gold.” A sick excuse for a
sick crushing. Hitherto this mine has averaged an ounce
to the ton. _ A .fall to less than half-an-ounce is proof
beyond any doubt or excuse that the reef is much poorer,
and it is Slee’s duty to say so. “ Perhaps the concen-
trates ! ” Why did he not try them ?

New Bushman’s, Parkes, N.S.W. (first crushing

over 800 tons. It has since cleaned up 156 loads for 3350 z.
of amalgam, and the mill is shut down again for want of
water. The shareholders may reasonably expect some
divs., as it is one of the very few shows in N.S.W. suffi-
ciently open to see any divs. ahead. It is a good mine,
well managed, but it might have been wiser to have taken
one of the big offers, which only float about when John
Bull is in a bad state of boom. He will soon be in a state
of bust, and the chances are that the Bushman’s mine will
one day be in such a condition as to make its shareholders
wish they had taken their divs. from J.B. in advance.

here are earning £1 per day. They are really earning more
considering the infernal climate and surroundings, but
they are only getting paid £4 a week, except a very few
who receive 15s. a day. Things are very dull owing to the
holiday exemption being near. After that you will have
another lie wafted to you; the same old lie-not men
enough to man the leases. The consequence will be more
exemption, whilst men are idling in Coolgardie wearily
waiting for a job anywhere, but then you can’t go about
in this country from one place to another at distances of

man at the Great Gordelphs mine, and be told when you
get there that they are full-handed and going to apply for
exemption. —Yours, Get Back as Soon as I Can.

stuff we read so much about. The Mainland Consols
struck it heavy the other day- say a cwt. of solid gold at
£6O per lb. Reduce this to pence, divide by number of
shares, and note the splendid div. ! This is a specimen
mine, and when they come to mill the lode the mullock-
tip will be the ultimate destination of most of it, and it is

Kalgoorlie wire concerning a rush last Sunday ;
“ One of the party saw a 24-acre block on which was a

which should carry nice gold, but they don’t.

Poor old Coolgardie has at last had another
rush within the town boundaries. “ A number of leases
were taken up, including the warden’s residence. The
country is an ironstone formation, and assays give encour-
aging returns, It is believed that the big outcrop along
this line has shed ,the gold on Fly Flat.” Coolgardie is
getting wearied of the hundreds of ghastly, barren, buck,
and otherwise ugly and valueless reefs on which the
mines around the town are situated, and is now trying to
find gold in ironstone. But it won’t wash this time.
These ironstone croppings have been napped by hundreds,
and if any other proof of their poorness was wanted the
“ encouraging returns by assay ” supply it.

Tom Bakhap, an experienced Tas. tin-miner,
writes to a local daily re Premier Braddon’s now cele-
brated Anchor mine : “ Every penny of the co’s working
capital (£50,000) will be required, but, if judiciously
expended, and too many ornamental figure-heads are not
indulged in, Ido not think failure need be feared.” Good,
safe statement!
To work the aforesaid Anchor tin-mine (Tas.)
at anything approaching a Mt. Bisohoff return (say 12 per
cent, on market-value of shares) it will be necessary to
crush 5900 tons weekly. This means that the proposed
200 head of stamps will have to be increased to about 250
as the former number could only turn out 3000 tons
weekly. Moreover, an extensive and expensive system of
water conservation will have to be undertaken the
Groom River doesn’t carry enough water to treat 5000
tons of rock every week-so the working capital of
£50,000 won’t be a penny too much. Of course, it isn’t a
moral that the co. expects a Bischoff rate of return.
Unless tin-values rise a lot it is a moral it won’t get it.
Thus, innocently, a miner, discussing in a paper
the Anchor chances of success ; “ The stock of the co has
been confessedly much watered, but nowadays this seems
to be the rule.”

At Glen Wills, Vic., writes a Bulletin corres-

taken something like £lOO per day over his bar. The
mining village is located in the centre of the workings,
where most conveniently stores can be delivered by
teams in a very hilly country. The miners are from week
to week delving in gullies and hillsides, on spots reached
by steep up-grade routes - chiefly bridle-tracks at dis-
tances from half-a-mile upwards. But on Saturdays, with
wages in pocket, a swinging gait carries a man into
“town ”in no time. Between Saturday afternoon and the
weary walk back to work on Monday, it is a bad record
when the publican does not take £li)0 over the bar, and
that amount is often exceeded. Attempts have been
made to cut in with a second hotel, but the licensing
bench at Omeo doesn’t see that it is “ required in the
neighborhood.” Neither did two or three shanty-keepers
who were convicted about the middle of this year for
catering for the overflow from the pub. and heavily fined.

The latest Victorian swindle is the weigh-bridge

quite satisfied that those documents gave the
weight to an ounce. It now transpires that certain
lessees of weigh-bridges act in collusion with certain
vendors and carters, and cheerfully give receipts to the
effect that 19cwt., or less, make one ton. Some are even
satisfied with 17 cwt.

Peroration from a recent leading article in
Jimmy Thompson’s paper, the Murchison Times “ Only
when the inevitable day of reckoning comes the Mur-
chison will have less to answer for to the British investors
than the Southern goldfield” (Coolgardie). Which cer-
tainly seems to mean that Coolgardie and the Murchison
are both going to certain smash in the adjacent future,
only the enthusiastic Thompson thinks his field won’t fall
with quite such a thud as the other one.

Die electric boom is coming. One Sydney firm,
doing only the lighting of a citv block, clears close on 20
Percent, profit. Also, George Adams, who is building a
music-hall in Pitt-street, purposes laying down a £lO,OOO
electric plant, which will supply light, not only for his
own premises, but for the Market to Park-street block.
Several big English electrical firms are making very strong
efforts to secure the lighting of Sydney, and, tailing that.
permission to erect central bulk supply depots. Almost
all the aldermen have been cautiously sounded. If
Sydney Municipal Council ever permits the electric lighr-
mg to get beyond its control, it will create a huge and
unmanageable monopoly, and throw away a big revenue,
and create a power which will practically own the citv.

There are at present upwards of 200 out-of-work
miners and navvies hanging about the Ml. Lvell (Tas.)
works. Local men hav.e been discharged to make room
for Vic. miners and navvies, who are imported on mort-
gaged. passage tickets. Naturally enough the local men
howl; hut Victorian capital means that Victorian influ-
ence will bemused whenever possible to secure any jobs
that may be going. As the Tassies have no Vic. influence,
and hardly any dn their own country, they are frozen out.

~rT hS ,t ruck s y stem is alleged to be rampant on
West Coast (Tas.) mining fields. With the importation of
labor from other provinces, this is comparatively easv <>f
accomplishment. Steamboat proprietors, storekeepers,
and mining bosses stand in together, and have a good
time trading on the necessities of the man in moleskins.
* * »
In leaving Coolgardie, Herr Schmeisser and
Herr Vogelsang, the commissioners of the German Govt.,
and the representatives of one or more London mining
investment companies, took care to deny that they had
given anyone authority to say what they thought of the
fields. They had not even written their preliminary
report, and did not intend to do so till they had visited
the goldfields of the eastern provinces. This, after the
yarn that they considered South African fields not in
it with Coolgardie, indicates how Juuch reliance can he
placed on mining news from W.A.

From the latest report issued bv the London
liquidator of the English and Australian Mortgage Bank :
“The question of taking proceedings against the directors
and officers mainly responsible for the past, conduct and
management of the bank’s affairs in Australia was re-
ferred for opinion, which, when received in this country,
was fully discussed, but in view of the decision given in
the Victorian courts in an action brought against certain
of the directors of a similar institution, it was not deemed
advisable to incur the heavy costs and expenses of taking
proceedings in this case.”

* Barkes, N.S.W., is coming out of its mining
darkness. A discovery of gold has been made in a well
‘ ll assays one cwt. of gold to the ton,” says the local
newspaper hummer. Talk like this will kill any mining
camp. Mine-owners should suffocate or otherwise
slaughter about a score of N; S. W. mining correspondents
so as to give the mines a chance to speak for themselves

Woodstock G.M. Co., N.S.W. : “Will have

Visitors to'the Spouting Spring at Heli-
don, 70 miles from Brisbane, are always astounded
at the quantity of water they can consume at the
Spring. Ten or 12 tumblers in an hour or so are
taken with comfort. The reason is that the
tissues of the body are absorbing the water all the
time. Something beneficial is always added to
the system by every glass of Helidon Spa water
consumed. Messrs, Tooth and Co., Kent
Brewery, are the Sydney agents.
A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the raanu
facture, all the heating properties have been ex
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
Valor is the name of a Melbourne police"
man.
On Dec. 14, Queen Victoria was 34 years a
lone widow.
The only Melb. cleric who came right-end-
up out of the boom was “ Dane ” O’Hea.
Pastor Fitchett, in the Southern Cross,
writes that Booth’s face is “ too purely Semitic”—
he himself having a pleasantly-rounded, florid,
Saxon cheek.
The late J. B. Patterson, of ennobbled
memory, cut up rather better than was expected.
He leaves .£ll,OO0 —to his female relatives mostly
—which is a pretty fair dividend in these bad,
bust days.
Everything comes to him who waits—
except the capacity to enjoy it when it comes after
too long waiting. A pauper aged 102, in Liverpool
Poor Asylum, lately inherited close on £1,000,000
sterling. The irony of Fate !
Vic. Premier George Turner’s household
arrangements have no frills on them. He lives in
a modest six-roomed cottage, where all the house-
work is done by his wife and daughters, without
the aid even of a hired girl.
Lister, the Dunedin (M.L.) editor whose
office was wrecked and self and staff much
spanked by the ladies of the Gaiety Co., has got a
new experience. He is now doing three months’
“ hard ” for libelling a solicitor.
William Porteous, aged 100, committed
suicide, in Melbourne, the other day, by cutting
his throat. Porteous was tired of life. Ap-
parently a man never gets used to it, however
much experience he may have.
Civilization is progressing amongst the
Maoris. _ A native had all the principal store-
keepers in Palmerston with valueless cheques, and
then, donning swell kilts and mounting a bicycle,
made things hum in that usually quiet village.
Griffith, C.J., has lately been favoring
prisoners, convicted or otherwise, with affecting
moral homilies. The Robb arbitration case, how-
ever, delivered such a moral homily on Griffith
that anything he can say himself falls comparatively
flat.
Gov. Buxton has refused his patronage
to two S.A. racing-clubs. The man with nerve
enough to ask him to accept the honorary presi-
dency, or something of that sort, of the local
Licensed Victuallers’ Association has yet to happen
along.
Dear Bulletin,—ln your issue of the 7th
inst. you give me credit for being the author of
“ A Dream of Fair Judges.” I only wish I were.
It is the work of Frank Gavan Duffy, one of the
most able members of our Bar. —Yours truly,
O’Hara Wood.
The alleged
reason of the
back-down of
the Welling-
ton (M.L.)
Post in the
libel proceed-
ings taken
against it by
Treas. Ward,
was the serious
illness of editor
Gillon, who is
not in fighting
condition just
now. Gillon
has come to
Sydney for
medical ad-
vice, and an
exploratory
operation
shows that he
is in a very
-serious condi-
tion indeed,
Gillon has
been in the
forefront of
Maoriland
journalism for
over 40 years.
He reported on
the first Han-
sard in the
early sixties,
and no man
has a more in-
timate know-
ledge of the
political his-
tory of Maori-
land.
William
Weary is a re-
cent Sydney
insolvent. The
way they run
the insolvency
law would
make any man
feel that way.
Saul Samuel celebrated his 75th birthday
last week (writes The Bulletin’s London corre-
spondent). The very ancient Samuel looks much
younger than he did a year or two ago, and seems
as if he might hold his billet till he becomes a
centenarian.
James Service, M.L.O. (Vic.) has just
passed 75. Five years ago people still spoke of
Service as the best Treasurer who ever held office
in Victoria. Now, all they say of him is that any-
body could have been a successful Treasurer in
those fine old boom days.
“ Tattersall ” Adams is removing his con-
sultations to Tasmania. His presence there ought
to mean about .£30,000 a year more postal revenue,
and if Tasmania is wise it will let the harried con-
sultationist remain, and take the money, and
-smother its religious scruples.
Michael Davitt was offered a purse of
sovereigns by his admirers at Wellington (M.L.),
but the one-armed patriot refused the offer and
\ he P urse and the money go to the cause instead.
Let us see—who was the last Australian politician
who refused a similar cash donation?
Gov. Brassey hangs out on Melb. Govt,
House, at his own expense, a new Union Jack,
measuring 24ft. by 12ft. This is just four times
the size of any “ Jack ” previously displayed from
ttie square-top tower. It is obvious that Brassey
is bidding for that Earldom for all he is worth,
The late Duke of Hamilton was a primi-
tive kind of humorist. Once he bought 21b. of
treacle at a grocery, poured it in his belltopper,
and then P ut the bat on the shopman’s head and
laughed consumedly. But, then, no man with a
real sense of bumor could continue to be a duke,
“Jimmy” Thompson, of many exhibi-
tipns fame, and who, as manager of Melbourne
Standard, was fined £lOO and imprisoned for
seven days for commenting on a certain famous
grand jury is now proprietor of a newspaper at
Cue (W.A.) and a J.P. He is a most unprofitable
beak, his fines being almost always nominal.

Miss Sutherland, the philanthiopist, has
rescued 1720 children, mostly girls, from the Mel-
bourne streets. Many are well married, and some
of these take m other waifs. In one ease Miss b.
established the title of a R.C. infant to £15,000 in
Ireland. The letter she received from an institu-
tion there was addressed to “Father Sutherland.”

bran-sack couches.
One Clear, of Nelson (M.L.), has had the
distinction of being photographed as the local
footballer who lost most teeth this year. A photo-
grapher, by way of encouraging the manly game,
offered to photo, the man who had his mouth
worst damaged in the season lately closed, and

A well-known N.S. W. lawyer was so badly
mauled recently by a client to whom he had
presented a bill for £403 that he had to remain in
bed for several days. And the law solemnly fined
las assailant 40s. Attorneys are evidently growing
oheap in N.S.W., and the time may yet come
w hen two of them may be assaulted for 3d., with a
further reduction on bashing a quantity.
Melb> . stro ngly object to the wife of
perhaps the most influential member of the
Cabinet going round the civil-servants, cadging
charity - subscriptions. Of course, none dare
refuse. Consider the hypocrisy engendered, and
the sense of wrong left with officials, into whose
pockets a fair hand is insinuated after this
manner.”

monises with sassiety’s remarks on Agnes herself
now that the pushing young female is far away’
The strange thing of yore was that the women
feared Miss Murphy. They couldn’t have been
afraid of her feeble satire in the local Paunch but
they certainly dreaded her power to ignore their
tea-fights and cut off their jam supply.
Ex-Chief -J ustice Lilley, of Queensland, is
66, and he badly wants to lead a new political
party and oust the Boodlewraith Cabinet and
start his political career over again—if only the
chance will present itself. It is thirty years since
Lilley took office as Attorney-General in the first
Queensland Ministry under Responsible Govern-
ment, and twenty-seven years since his one brief
experience as Premier.
Colonel Gerard Smith’s appointment to
Westralia is not viewed with much favor by
colonists (writes The Bulletin’s London corre-
spondent); not that there is anything against him,
but he is simply an unknown quantity. All that
can be said about him is that he was M.P. for a
division of Bucks, and was once a Groom-in-
Waiting to H.M. He is, or was, a member of a
banking firm in Hull, and chairman of the Hull
and Barnsley Railway. Personally he is an
ordinary genial kind of Smith, and that is about
a p

The son of a deceased Maoriland Premier
recently got three months at Coolgardie under the
vag.
Premier Kingston (S.A.) told a recent
Caledonian gathering *that he is a direct descen-
dant of Lochiel. The S.A. Premier’s father was
an Irishman and his mother a Portuguese, and one
of his grandmothers, it seems, was a Cameron, and
he was born in Australia, so he should be solid for
the Scotoh-Irish-Australian vote, and the cordial
support of the Dago fruit-selling interest.
Nat. Levi started as an auctioneer in
Collins-street (Melb.) 41 years ago. His “ office ”
was one room 16ft. square, for which he gave .£l4
a week rental. He defeated Ireland, then a
Minister, for Maryborough in 1860, and was the
first Jew elected to Victorian Assembly. He is
opposed to payment of members, and, one might
conjecture from recent court cases, to payment of
compositors also.
Recently, in a Northern town, a man
found guilty of assault on a female was asked
what he had to say before sentence was passed.
He replied that he could offer no explanation of
the sudden impulse which drove him to his crime,
except that he had put on an old suit just given
him by “ a good, kind old gentleman.” Possibly
the microbes of the kind old gentleman’s wicked-
ness were in the clothes.
Strange, aged 22, now lying under sentence
of death for the Cunninghame (Vic.) murder, has
an undoubted taint of insanity in his disposition.
Both his grand-parents, as well as a grand-uncle
and aunt, are stated to have died in lunatic
asylums. He himself has always borne a good
character, but has been noted for occasional out-
bursts of irresponsible fury, and it was during one
of these that his crime was committed.
Premier Turner despises the richly-uphol-
stered leather chairs on the floor of the House,
and, when sitting at the table, invariably uses a
plain Yankee cane-bottomed chair, placed there
specially for his convenience. Whenever he is
£>oing to make an important speech, he gets all
the other chairs taken away by the messengers, in
order that his train of thought will not be upset
by members buzzing about in his vicinity.
J. Nathaniel Wilson, who died in London
the other day, was a member of M.L. Legislative
Council until two years ago, when he resigned.
He joined the Grey Ministry in ’7B, but it collapsed
the following year. Wilson possessed an unusually
gruff voice, which seemed to come from his very
boots, and he affected a black slouch hat of the
most desperate brigand character, an enormous
mass of long, dank hair, and a general aspect of
harmless ferocity.
Archdeacon Piddington (writes The Bul-
letin’s London correspondent) is going back to
Sydney with considerably less cash than he
expected to get for his bishop —about .£2OOO less, as
a matter of fact. The Mansion House meeting
was a frost, only about .£lOO being subscribed, of
which Mr. F. H. Hangar, gave one-half. Daniel
Cooper has given ,£lOO, and his sons, Dan and
Willie, .£lOO each. The millionaire, Donald
Larnach, parted a tenner.
Herbert, who has been taken on trial as
Agent-General by the Tasmanians, has the dis-
tinction not only of being Queensland’s first
Premier, but of having filled the office for a longer
consecutive period than anyone who succeeded
him. He held office for over six years, and the
next six years saw five Ministries fall and the
sixth one go distinctly bad. Lilley is about the
only other survivor of that long-lived first
Ministry. When he returned to England, Her-
bert obtained employment under the Imperial
Government. He is a barrister by profession, but
though alleged to be full of legal knowledge he
seldom appeared in the courts.
The will of “ Jim ” Toohey, brewer, was
sworn at 20,000. It is said that the firm, which
has been established just over 20 years, cleared
.£50,000 last year. The first big leg-up it got was
at the time of the famous Danjgnong gale. The
storm swept down the gully in which Burrows
and Gleeson’s brewery at Waverley was situated,
and with it went all the ready stock and beer in
course of brewing. To keep their customers
supplied B. and G. got Toohey’s people to brew
for them, and most of the trade remained with
the latter firm permanently.
The Richardson
family have been fisher-
men at Double Bay, Syd-
ney, for 50 or 60 years.
The founder of the family
was given the right to
own as much land in the
Bay as he chose to en-
close. Like'the grasping
old land-shark that he
was, he fenced in an
allotment measuring just
60ft. by 100 ft. The, con-
sideration for this grant
was that he was to catch
fish for the military. In
their career as fishermen
the family have probably
recovered more dead
bodies than any other
shellbacks along the Syd-
ney water-front. “But
v. e don’t do it now if we
can help it,” says one of
the descendants of the
ancient mariner who
fooled away his chance
of annexing all Double
Bay ; “ there’s nothing in
going to two or three
inquests a week. I make
it a point never to sight
’em, though I always try
to put someone else on
to ’em. Not long ago I
saw one on the beach and
made tracks, of course.
Met a chap looking for
prawns for bait; he axes
me if I can lay him on,
so I pointed out a place
where I thought he might

he; “why, it’s got
blucher boots on J”
Governor Buxton (S.A.) has had his first
instalment of “ colonial experience ” in a visit to
Bungaree station and a kangaroo bunt. People
who were there say that the spectacle of the con-
verted brewer chasing a baby kangaroo three miles
and finally breaking down in a gallant attempt
to grab him by the tail (which, by the way, nearly
ended in Buxton breaking his neck in a creek),
was a very fine sight. Buxton hunts like no other
man in this world except John Lucas.
A French pen-picture of Zim. ; “ Zimmer-
man, thin and sinewy, with nothing indicative of
the cyclist; dress most correct; sharp features,
under a straw hat with a red ribbon. See him
walk along the street, his figure sways from side
to side as if disjointed; his legs, which on the
pedals are like steel, seem now broken; his gait
that of a savage duck accustomed to devour space,
and awkward in his walk; and on his smooth-
shaven face the serene air of an emperor.”
Scene during Midland Railway Arbitration
case in Parliament Buildings, Wellington (M.L.):
An expert from the West Coast, asked by counsel
as to his occupation, replied, “ Mining agent.”
“Anything else?’’ “Auctioneer.” “Anything
else?” “ Commission agent.” Court becomes in-
terested. “ Anything else ? ” “ Practical miner. ”
Here umpire Blake laid down his pen and took up
the parable: “Does this gentleman do anything
else?” “Oh, yes,” replied the other side; “he
has also been a manager of mining companies,
director of the Govt. School of Mines, and is now
advising agent to Mr. Ziman, the S. African
mining speculator.” And then the examining
counsel proceeded to ask witness: “ Have you
any knowledge of mining ? ” The Law is a
frivolous ass ! t
Crisp, the Austral winner, rode a cool,
well-judged race—equal to a veteran’s. A young-
ster, he had to meet the best men of Australia and
a red-hot favorite in Elliott, who is a thoroughly
experienced wheeler. But it was Crisp’s day out,
and as he clicked round the course the cries and
shouts of trainers to their men—“ Watch Elliott!”
“ Look out for Elliott!” “ Keep up to Elliott!”—
didn’t upset him in the least. He rode gamely,
keeping himself all together, cutting out a hot pace
all the way. And when the last lap’s struggle came
he shot away and won. His time, 4min. 42 l-ssec.,
lowers the Austral record by 19sec., but taking
the respective starts into consideration, it is not so
much better than Middleton’s smin. 1 3-ssec.
Young Crisp is apparently a thoroughly nice boy.
His papa is an M.L. A. of Tas., and his uncle is
the Rev. J. W. Crisp, of the Wesleyan Parsonage,
St. Kilda. Young Crisp does not drink, smoke,
nor bet, and is articled to a Hobart firm of
solicitors. The boy hero was received in Hobart
with citizens, bands, ovations and processions.
He was publicly congratulated in the Town Hall
by the Mayor, and afterwards at a banquet his
health was proposed by the Chief Secretary. How
the bicycle craze is biting into the marrow of the
Australian nation!

SOME IDEAS FROM MELBOURNE.


CHRISTMAS CHEER FOR THE
UNEMPLOYED.
Mr. Milieu, In the Legislative Assembly,
yesterday afternoon, asked the Minister for
Labor, In the absence of the Premier, whe-
ther, in connection with the proposals to
afford the unemployed in Sydney some of
the comforts of Christmas, he would see
that the worklesa men of the country were
placed on a similar'footlng to those in the
city..
Neild led off with an appeal
to the Government to do something tor the
unfortunate women and girls who have to
satisfy the requirements of life with a
miserable pittance earned only after ex-
travagantly long hours of work.
‘■How are you to cure this?” was the
question put to him. Mr. Gann asked for

POLITICAL POINTS
Vic.’s village' settlement experiment to
date has mopped up £48,005 12s. 6d. Out of the
original 3633 settlers, 2485 remain. And they
curse the land.
To ensure a healthy metropolitan meat
supply, the Vic. Government has appointed a clerk
out of the postal department to the position of
inspector of stock, etc.
The most melancholy and lonely member
of N.S.W. Assembly is M'Millan, who has no
political acquaintances now that Parkes, Wise,
and Bruce Smith are out in the cold.
The Woman’s Suffrage and One-Man-One*
Vote Bill was thrown out in Vic. Council by 19
votes to 17. It seems like a dream that 17 out of
the 48 Rich Landlords could be induced to vote
for manhood suffrage.
The humor of it ! Griffiths, M.L.A. :
“ When do you propose to give private members
an opportunity of doing private members’ busi-
ness?” Premier Reid: “During the recess.”
(Loud laughter, of course).
J. C. Neild, M.L.A., wound up his speech
on the “ sweating ” evil last week with the declara-
tion : “So help me God, I am a humanitarian.”
And yet this is the same Neild who once talked
the House almost to death in a nine hours’ speech.
One provision in the Vic. Railway Trust
Bill is that the fact of railway advts. being
inserted in a newspaper belonging to a trustee
shall not be a disqualification. Which newspaper
proprietor is going to be appointed to a seat on
the Trust ?
The Federal Enabling Bill has practically
passed N.S.W. Parliament, and the Victorian and
S.A. Governments have both started to shove the
same measure through with all possible despatch.
The great chance which Parkes fooled away in ’9l
seems to be coming again.
The A rous, with powerful spectacles on
each eye, sees in the Sydney of the Freetrade
future the great commercial centre of the Southern
seas. But what about all the long years before
the accursed Dibbs tariff came i*x? Why didn’t
Sydney run the universe then 1
Braddon, K.C.M.G., practically runs Tas-
mania now. He is Premier without salary, does
the olfice work of the Chief-Secretary (Moore
being a cipher in Tasmanian politics), runs the
Education Dept., and proposes to take up the
Dept, of Agriculture. He also superintends
Treasurer Fysh between times, Fysh being a per-
fectly harmless politician who can be trusted to
feed out of the hand.
A* Queensland
Parliamentary com-
mittee has resolved,
after grave and pon-
derous enquiry, that
“ The charges made
in the Courier and
the Worker, so far
as they accused
members of Parlia-
ment of acting in
any dishonorable
way in connection
with the Consulta-
tions Regulation
Bill, were not true.”
By way of wild
humor the commit-
tee further reports
that the Worker,
the Government’s
avowed and bitter
enemy, was to some
extent justified in
its remarks, and
that the grovelling
Courier, which has
consistently abased
itself before the Fat
Man Parliament
and knocked its
forehead in the
dust, had no visible
justification what-
ever. In other
words, it seems to
imply that the
Worker was only
misled, while the
Courier was a
wholly gratuitous
Tozer. .
M‘Millan, the Freetrade M.L.A. : “We
were supposed in N.S.W. to have got down to the
bed-rock of the depression, but we were told that
12 months ago, and there is no glimmer of hope
for the next 12 months.” M‘Mi 11 an has evidently
ceased to regard the new Foreign-trade tariff as a
glimmer.
In Sydney, the other day, the Crown
subpoenaed the defendant’s lawyer as a witness for
the prosecution. Then it requested the bench to
order all witnesses out of court, which meant
ordering out the defendant’s solicitor with the
rest and leaving him with no one to conduct his
case. The Crown is a humorous institution at
times in Botany Bay, and the pity is that the
public is required to take it seriously. The kind
of Crown that pervades N.S. Wales was never
meant to be taken seriously.
An ideal income-tax would grant the father
of a family an exemption of £3O for every child
under the age of, say, 18 years. To allow the
same margin in every ease is wholly unfair; a
£2OO exemption to a bachelor and a £2OO exemp-
tion to a man with 11 children are two very
different exemptions.
Pursy Chimside, M.L.A., is suspected of
forming himself, bai Jove ! into a new party, with
a view of upsetting the present Vic, Government.
Pursy sits somewhat alone in the House, and
frowns stealthily, and pulls his cuffs down with
care, as though airaid of disclosing his deep poli-
tical plot before it is ripe.
Shiels, the man of many phases and
phrases, who tries to smash Ministries with
epigrams that smell of the midnight kerosene, has
made another futile attempt to capsize the Turner
Government. Shiels’s worst enemies wish him
luck in these forlorn hopes, for with that long, sad,
diffuse young man nothing fails like success.
Prendergast, M.L.A. (Vic.), wanted to
add to the Factories Bill a provision against any
carrier removing furniture from which the stamp
had been removed. But he got the clause mixed
up so that it read that no unstamped carrier was
to remove furniture, and the House poked
“borak ” at Prendergast till he retired in a huff.
It is pretty well known in Vic. Parlia-
mentary circles that Attorney-General Isaacs
wanted to be allowed to give his reasons for say-
ing that the seat of that brother-Hebrew, Levien,
would not be worth a month’s purchase if the
Government said all it knew about him. But
Premier Turner, who loves peace, set his foot
down, and the one or two Jews on the Govt, side
of the House kicked up a fuss. The consequence
was that Isaacs had to back down apologetically and
spoil an interesting episode.
That notice of motion which proposes to
affirm “ That, in the opinion of this House, his
Honor Sir William Windeyer should no longer
retain his seat as a Puisne Judge of the Supreme
Court of New South Wales,” still figures on the
business paper of the Assembly. At every sitting
the Speaker solemnly goes through the farce of
mumbling out “No. 50, so-and-so, Mr. Price”;
the Government whip as solemnly mutters
“ Object,” and the thing is done with for the day.
As The Bulletin has remarked already: the
hour has come, but Price isn’t the man.
Should Coolgardie obtain separation, the
Swan River gang will be in a pitiable plight. J.
Bull has put his money on the goldfields, and his
sympathy is where his money is. And, if he can
be shown that separation will help along his in-
terests, there is plenty of influence to logroll a
new province in about the quickest time on record.
Unless the Esperance Bay Railway is got under
weigh the trouble will almost certainly begin at
an early date. And if the goldfields get separa-
tion and establish their port on the south coast,
Perth will be almost as dead as Babylon.
The gentle and peaceable Kanaka has been
breaking out in Rockhampton. About 300 wild,
unemployed islanders are camped near the town,
and one night 150 of them charged the Salvation
Army, broke up the service, wrecked the big
SPLITTING THE DIFFERENCE.
FAT MAN: “ Three shillings a day is what we're paying

MOLRSKINGS: “ Well, boss, make it three-an’-six and a free funeral.”
drum, and badly walloped a number of Salva-
tionists. Then they crippled a policeman, laid out
a local citizen with a large “gibber ” in the waist-
coat, stabbed another in the face, violently kicked
a boy and two little girls, and filled the air with
stones and knives and gibberish. When the mild
and efficient islander does break out he is bound
to kick some small girl or other.
Governor Brassey complained, at a Melb.
Y.W.C.A. bun-worry, that Victorians expect
impossibilities from their Governor. “It is im-
possible for any man—certainly impossible for
me,” said his Ex., “ to deliver twice in every day
of the week carefully-prepared addresses on differ-
ent subjects.” Yet really the people of Victoria
wouldn’t care a cent if Brassey didn’t deliver an
address a month. The conviction that he is in
duty bound to jaw constantly and at great length,
and to go down into the very bowels of his sub-
ject every time, is going to make Brassey pall
dreadfully in the course of a few weeks.
Schey’s Bill to amalgamate the N.S.W. soli-
citor and barrister into one shark, and to make
the barristerial end of the animal do the work he
is paid for or else hand back his fee, was thrown
out by the Leg. Council chiefly through the agency
of barrister Want. That legal gentleman called
on the Councillors to “ chuck ” the measure on the
vague and weepful ground that, in some way not
explained, it would be a bitter injustice to the
poor litigant—that person whom every barrister
sympathises with so deeply that he can’t sleep at
night. Also, he pointed out that Schey wasn’t a
lawyer, and therefore couldn’t possibly be compe-
tent to deal with this legal robbery, which is just
the same as arguing that because a man isn’t a

burglar he can’t possibly make a law for the
repression of burglary. But the Council didn’t
see the point, and it loathed Schey on general
principles, and the Bill went overboard.
Premier Reid stated to the managers for
the Legislative Council, during the conference
between the two Houses on the Land and Income
Tax, that he will not sit in any Government
which endeavours to raise the land-tax over the
present Id. in the £. The assurarice has been
registered for reference by the old Freetrade-
party, and is taken as marking the line of cleavage
in the Reid following. When the inevitable
demand for more land-tax comes along, Reid is
pledged to throw in his lot with the Parkes-Burns-
Davies-M‘Millan band of ancient revenue-tariffists,
and then the rest of the party must seek a new
leader.
The Reid Government’s proposal to build
railways from Cobar to Broken Hill, Condobolin
to Menindie, and Bourke to Barringun—about 6<K)
miles of line costing nearly £‘2, 000,000 —fell dead.
The latter line was killed by the alleged discovery
that there are only 75 inhabitants in 85 miles.
These far Western lines wouldn’t pay for a very long
while if built on the borrowed money principle,
and, anyhow, the bulk of Ms.L.A. represent
eastern districts, and the eastern districts can
swallow all the borrowed cash that is going. And
yet even the Cobar-Broken Hill line couldn’t, by
any fiendish ingenuity, pay much worse than
Shea’s Creek.
Three of the reasons advanced by the
Midland Railway Co. for its claim of ,£1,800,000
against the Maoriland Government are worth
recording as fine examples of the gall of J. Bull.
They are: (1) That the State delayed for an ur
reasonable time to consent to certain large devia-
tions from the original contract. The co. had no
claim for these concessions, which were granted as
a favor, and it now wants large damages be-
cause the favor wasn’t granted soon enough; (2) That
the State was unreasonably slow in consenting to
an extension of time —another favor that wasn’t
granted so quickly as the arrogant J. Bull syndi-
cate thought it should be ; (3) that the lands of
the co. were not exempted from land-tax. The
British shindykit not only wants the earth, but it
also wants damages if the earth isn’t forthcoming
as quickly as it might be.
Chief Justice Onslow, of Westralia, is at
present also Acting-Governor and President of the
Executive Council. Recently one Clinton wanted
damages for injuries received in a railway accident,
and the Council, of which Onslow was the Presi-
dent, decided to contest the claim. Then Clinton
sued the Government, of which Onslow was tem-
porarily a part, and Onslow, despite the fact that
he was a portion of the defendant, sat on the
bench as judge. He also in his double capacity as
judge and part of the defendant, summed up
against the plaintiff, and when the special jury
gave a verdict for £4OO, he remarked that “if
this was a special jury he would much like to
know what a common jury was like.” The latter
remark was probably only one of those gentle-
manly snorts which the average bad-tempered
judge fires off at people who are not allowed to
talk back, and was not indicative of any bias ; but
the mixing up of the executive and judicial office
in such a case always suggests a possibility of bias
none the less.
Howe, M.P., recently rose in S.A. Assem-
bly, at a most solemn moment, and desired to
observe : “ When the war cloud lowers over the
land let us stick to our oars like men, and not
wait till the steed is stolen before looking the
stable door.” The members woke up, and were
just beginning to dissect this statement, when
there was a loud clap of thunder,. and Howe sat
down.
Dear Bulletin, —No wonder that there
are continual difficulties about the management of
the Victorian railways. The present Minister of
Railways, Williams, is a one-eyed man ; the last
Minister, Richards, was a one - armed man.
Wheeler—who was Minister of Railways in the
Shiels Govt. —has only one tooth. What is
wanted for the Victorian lines is a whole man, not
a mere fraction,— A One-Legged Man.
The Reid
(N.S.W.) Govern-
ment proposes to
sacrifice .£lOO,OOO
a year by extend-
ing the period of
selectors’ pay-
ments and reduc-
ing the interest on
unpaid instal-
ments, and it also
suggests reducing
railway freights
on agricultural
produce, which
are already below
paying point, the
further loss to be
made up out of
the general re-
venue by an an-
nual subsidy of
.£50,000 to the
railway depart-
ment. Therefore
the general body
of taxpayers is to
pay £150,000 a
year to help along
the agriculturists,
instead of leaving
them to the un-
restricted bless-
ings of Free Com-
petition. This is
food enough on
Toteotionist prin-
ciples, but for a
Freetrade Govern-
ment (backed up
by a Freetrade
press which is
subsidised by the
taxpayer to the
extent of some
£50,000 a year
through gratis
newspaper post-
age) it is a shame-
ful case of backsliding. Isn’t there even one
1 reetraaer anywhere who has the courage to live
up to his alleged creed ?
In the Vic. mallee districts, according to
Longmore, M.L.A., some of the big original
leaseholders who pay the State one-twentieth of
a penny per acre per annum are selling their rights
for 10s. and 20s. per acre. The Bill now before
Parliament provides for the granting of mallee
leases at a rental of 2 per cent, on the capital
value, and unless great care is taken this will also
mean that the State tenant, who gets his land at
2 per cent., will sub-let it by-and-bye at five. Sub-
leasing of State lands is partly sweating and
partly defrauding the revenue ; it should be abso-
lutely illegal; and the minimum penalty should be
the forfeiture of the original lease and a fine of
five times the amount of the rent colleoted from
the sub-tenant.
The anaemic Vic. Freetrade Association,
which is always on the point of dying for want of
money to pay the office rent, and which consists
mainly of Premier Reid’s brother, has telegraphed
Premier Reid congratulating him on the establish-
ment of Freetrade and direct taxation in New
South Wales. Reid proposes to raise three times
as much by Customs duties as by direct taxation,
so there doesn’t seem so very much to telegraph
about after all. When is the Shoddy Government
coming along which will establish real Freetrade,
and let the party have the blessing it is always
asking for ? New South Wales has voted Free-
trade for many years, and has never got it, and
never gets much nearer to it, and never seems
really to want it. And if it did get it the Free-
trade-party would probably be the most disgusted
institution in this hemisphere.
Melb. Metrop. Board, dissatisfied with the
working of its minimum-wage arrangement, pur-
poses altering the law to the following effect■
That for each day of eight hours not less than the
following wages shall be paid to persons of the under-
mentioned ages employed under the board’s contracts,
that is to say, under the age of 16 years, 2s. 6d. ; 16 and
under 20 years, 4s. ; 20 years and under 55 years, 6s. ;
over 65 years, 4s.
The alleged purpose of this sliding .scale is to give
the eternal old man a show. The obvious result
will be that men between the ages of 20 and 55
will not be wanted by Metrop. Board contractors,
and the alleged minimum-wage law will not be
worth a straw. The laborer who wants a job
when the Fitzgibbon Board has revised its present
chuckle-headed scheme will have to be over 55 or
under 20—on the pay-sheet, at least. Some con-
tractors will come right down to the half-crown
scale at once, and insist on everybody being under
16, even if he has a wife and eight children.

A CHRISTMAS STORY
By MARK FOY.
MARK ROY’S contribution to The
Bulletin’s Christmas Number has
nothing to do with ghosts and fairies, or
troubadours and fair ladies. No wicked
uncle is slain in the first chapter, nor is
any girl married in the last.
It’s a simple statement of fact in five
chapters, but he hopes it will prove not
only interesting to his readers, but very
profitable to them.
Chapter the First.
Ladies' Handkerchiefs.
White, machine-hemmed, per half-dozen
Hem-stitched, neat colored border, per
half-dozen ... ls OJd, Is 3d
White Lawn, hem-stitched, per half-
dozen ... Is ls 3d, Is 6d, Is 9d
White Linen Cambric, per half-dozen ...
2s to 6s 6d
Embroidered French Lawn ... to Is 6d
Japanese Silk Handkerchiefs, 21| to 26
inches ... ... ... Is to 3s 6d
Silk Maltese Lace Handkerchiefs
Is 11 to 5s 6d
Real Lace Handkerchiefs 5s lid, 7s"6d, 10s 6d
Chapter the Second.
Ready-made Costumes.
Striped Print and Zephyr Costumes,
with full skirt, and blouse with large
bishop sleeves ... ... ...7s lid
These nice costumes are in heliotrope,
pale-blue, navy, pink and black, each
color being relieved with a white block
stripe.
Sydney Ladies are thronging in to
secure one.
Plain and Spotted Pique Costumes ... 12s 6d
Black Lustre tailor-made Costumes,
Jacket and large sleeves ... 25s 6d, 27s 6d
These last two lines are only “ sam-
ples.” The supply is, therefore, not a
very big one.
Chapter the Third.
Art Muslins.
“Silkette,” an art muslin looking so
much like silk as to puzzle nine per-
sons out of ten.
Not only suitable for draping, but the
very thing for Children’s Fancy
Costumes at Christmas parties.

“ Well-known to the police, yer Wor-

Was charged with “drunk’’who had never been

“Yes, your worship—he’s Well-known to the

“No; but ho ought to have been.” Had this con-

By many the beneficent healing process
of Massage is thought to be a modern discovery,
butj as a matter of fact, it was known to the
ancients long before the Christian era—when it
was practised by the recognised physicians of the
day. It is only of late years that the medical
faculty has once again recognised its efficacy. As
a thoroughly scientific and most important and
valuable accessory to the modern art of medicine,
it is essential that Massage should be practised
only by thoroughly efficient practitioners. This
treatment is not mere rubbing ; its successful ad-
ministration depends entirely upon the special
qualifications of the masseur, who, in addition to
the physical gifts necessary, must have a complete
knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and organic
chemistry. That Mr. Teepoo Hall, of Collins-street,
Melbourne, possesses ail the qualifications neces-
sary to the successful and fashionable masseur is
abundantly proved by the fact that he has received
testimonials as to his ability, kindness, and atten-
tiveness from all the leading physicians of Mel-
bourne, including Urs. T. N, Fitzgerald* J, P,
Ryan, Arthur F. Davenport, M. U. O’Sullivan,
1. Taylor Downie, W, H. Burton, Walter M‘Gib-
bon, Geo. Graham, etc., besides clergymen and
many leading merchants and ladies. The pamph-
let issued by Mr. Teepoo Hall on this interesting
subject explains the system of treatment, and can
be obtained from him free, on receipt of 3 stamps.*
WOOL-TRADE WITH JAPAN.
The National Wool Company, of Melbourne, has
taken the initiative in bringing under the notice
of the Woolbrokers’ Association the importance of
developing our present wool-trade with Japan,
The first attempt in this direction was made 20
years ago by the late Mr. Monokton Synnot, and
a second one in 1885. The movement was pro-
perly organised, and would no doubt have suc-
ceeded but for a sudden rise in wool values—a rise
of from 25 to 30 per cent.—which at once killed all
interest in the movement by making producers
content with existing gains and indifferent or
lethargic in their attitude towards a movement
which then only seemed to aim at providing for a
vague necessity which might arise in the dim and
distant future. However, past investigation has
proved : (1) That woollen-manufacturing in China
and Japan is in its infancy. (2) That China, while
possessing sheep, produces no wool which will
compare favorably with our lowest qualities, and
that sheep are there propagated for food chiefly.
Also, that what wool is made use of, is used in the
method in vogue in Scriptural times, 2000 years
ago and upwards, with the skin attached. (3)
That Japan cannot breed sheep without growing
food to keep them alive in winter. It, therefore,
seems highly desirable that the efforts of the
National Wool Company to develope trade with
Japan should be supported vigorously.*
“The 440 village settlers in South Aus-
tralia,” writes a Bulletin correspondent, “ while
owing- the State .£B5 per head, spent .£l2OO a year
in tobacco—ls. per week per head (at wholesale
rates) if all were smokers. The tobacco-bill repre-
sents over 10 per cent, of the annual cost of keep-
ing the 1770 men, women, and children on the
settlement.” But man does not live by bread
alone. He, to a great extent, lives by tobacco,
especially as there is no grog on S.A. village-
settlements.

SPOUTING NOTIONS.
The interprovincial cricket-match, N.S.W. v.
8., or rather N.S.W. v. Queens!., nd Graziers’ Meat Export
o. for nine of the oo’s employes played—aroused a
dead-and-alive sort of interest in lydney. On Saturday—
the Governor’s day, and naturally I le best the attendance
was scarce 2000. The veteran Boyll* stood out in obedience
to the order of the boss of the Queensland Graziers’ Co.
That functionary also ordained that Hoare was to play.
Percy M'Donnell captained Q. ; Syd. Gregory N.S.W. If
Syd. didn’t work his bowling for all it was worth, lie never-
theless gave every bowler a good chance to distinguish
himself.
Coningham’s big scores of 151 in th fi ;-st innings,
and 51 in the second were made by garn i, - Ing cricket,
and were the feature of the match. The > ... > •er of the
Queensland Graziers’ Meat Export Co. i ' ■ > to
Coningham : “ Congratulations ; will show m apprecia-
tion substantially.” Coningham’s batting was p.. .omenal
after his five weeks of enforced rest. The way he and
M'Donnell, who are both quite out of practice, walloped
the N.S.W. bowling, shows that the province has no
champion trundler to take Turner’s place.
Lewis, of the Queensland Meat Export Go’s
team, is the co’s cooper, and is one of the biggest hitters
in Australia ; but he has a wretched defence, and did
nothing this trip.
Walters’ big score of 150 was knocked up by
hard graft and good luck in second-class style. One good
chance at 32 was missed by the wicket-keeeper, and a
better one was missed at 81 by “ Dr. Bobby” Macdonald,
the worst field in the world, perhaps. Little “ Dr. Bobby ”
Mac. dropped the ball as if it were a red-hot cannon-shot.
The only N.S.W. batsmen who didn’t give a chance in a
good score were Donnan (40) and Gregory (43).
The brilliant innings of the match was P.
M'Donnell’s 65 ; the last 40 of which were made in 10 hits
in this order, 4,4, 4,4, 4,5, 5,4, 2, 4. M'Donnell’s cutting
and driving were a treat; his fivers were off one over of
M'Kibbin’s ; one fell among the crowd, the other among
the ladies in their reserve.
P. Mac’s batting last Saturday recalls how,
when he captained the Australians against North of Eng-
land in ’BB, he enjoined upon everyone just before his
going to the wickets with A. Bannerman that the only
course the Australians could adopt was block, block,
block ; the wicket was bad and the match must not be
lost. P. Mao. took strike and, strictly following his own
advice, blocked the first ball, blocked it safely, just safely
enough to lift it clean out of the ground. Then he kept
on blocking steadily so as to allow that slogger, A. Banner-
man, to open his shoulders and demoralise the field. A. B.
swiped viciously, and drove up a tremendous three while
P. Mac. blocked up 84.
The Bananalanders fielded so well, especially
the ex-N.S.W. and ex-Vic. men, that dropping several
good catches at a great cost was all the more unpardon-
able. The pick of the visitors’ fieldsmen was Atkins, ex-
South Sydney man. N.S.W.’s score of 485 was no more
than should have been ; for day and wicket were perfect,
luck was quite favorable, and the visitors’ bowlers, know-
ing little, bowled mostly mediocre stuff, and often rub-
bish. Coningham was quite out of form with the ball.
• • ♦ »
The interprovincial match, N.S.W. v. Queens-
land Graziers’ Meat Export Co. terminated in a long-
drawn-out agony in the presence of a handful of members
and a large dust-cart. O’Brien, the last of the Butchers
representatives, made 48 runs; Dr. Bobby Macdonald
carried out his bat for 77, and the slow, painful innings
closed for 273. N.S.W. easily made the necessary 51,
winning by nine wickets. Donnan made 33, not out;
M'Kenzie 21, stumped.
Dr. Bobby Macdonald is a Brisbane dentist, and,
according to a legend from a reliable source, has a prac-
tice worth £3OOO a year.

Although The Bulletin’s attempt to place the
three prize-winners for the Austral Wheel Race was a
failure, its selection of seven men to fight out the finish
proved good enough. Of those seven men, two (Hall and
Anderson) fell. They were the only riders who came to
grief. The other five finished Ist, 3rd, 4th, 6th and 9th
respectively. Tub Bulletin ventured a suggestion that
the four top-weights—Pither, Parsons, Walker, and M'Lean
—had no chance, and they were all beaten off.
Hill’s ride in the Austral final (he finished sixth)
was an object lesson re the necessity for being provided
with a cool head to carry out a settled policy when
the pinch comes. On the previous Saturday the Victorian
won his heat in masterly style, after allowing Crisp to
make all the running. He spurted clean away from the
Tasmanian within the last furlong of the journey and
finished the fresher of the two. Crisp says now “ that he
had plenty of go left in him when he finished third for his
heat, in front of Peart.” Also, Peart thinks he could
have beaten Hill and Hall if he had chosen to go a little
faster in the heat, yet it stands to reason that the third
and fourth men in a test race are doing all they know
to make sure of the place which qualifies them for a
chance in the final. In proof of which assumption it will
be found, on looking into the figures, that Crisp and Peart
were the only competitors who, after finishing third and
fourth for their trial heat, managed to turn the tables on
the winner and the runner-up in the final.
The fourth of the Austral heats was the one to
pick the winner from, judging by the fast time and the
further fact that Payne, a fine performer, couldn’t over-
take the placed men. Well, The Bulletin picked three
out of its seven selections from that particular test-race,
and reckoned the winner and runner-up better wbrth
backing than Crisp, who finished third. So they were—
until the question came to be settled. Hall, the runner-
up, had the misfortune to get knocked over, and Hill was
found wanting in nerve. He would go to the front and
drop back again into third position ; then run very wide
and take the lead once more. In the Stand critics were
saying that Hill dodged about as though he had 100 yards
up his sleeve. But he couldn’t raise a spurt in the final
lap. His strength had to some extent evaporated under
the warm excitement of a £2OO prize. The statement that
Hill was beaten by the time (4.42 l-sth) is ridiculous, for
he did the distance in 4.45} on the previous Saturday—a
terribly sultry day. Besides, there is considerable doubt
as to 4.42 l-sth being the right time for the race. It was
originally registered on the official board as 4.45.
Zimmerman’s fancy for the Austral was young
mu
Payne, long ago tipped by The Bulletin as a
promising rider, was the only N.S. VV. representative who
showed to advantage in the M. B.C. recent meeting.
Winning the M.B.C. £4O plate was a fine performance.
• ♦ * *
Carpenter’s public crying over Parsons’ taking
the triplet from him is, all things considered, an inco-
herent display of feeling. It’s an accepted sporting con-
dition that no man is beaten on his merits, but it’s work-
ing that axiom to death to raise a whoop and wail after
being beaten by a lap. Fact is, Carpenter, Martin and Co.
couldn’t ride fast enough. In the five-mile race at the
last Sydney carnival, Lewis snatched the triplet cleverly
from Parsons and hung on just behind it for four miles
and three quarters. Then, in the last lap, Parsons
started on his own and beat Lewis all the way. Now
Parsons’ trainer issues a challenge to concede a lap in 10
miles to Carpenter, and give C. his own pacer all the way.
Which is a most generous offer to Carpenter after the way
that misguided youth has taken on.
* • • *
Crisp is one of the pluckiest young cyclists that
ever trod a treadle—“ trod a treadle” being the bikey
equivalent for “looked through a bridle.” The Tasmanian
boy came over to. Melbourne to win the Austral, a stranger
in a strange land, and didn’t trouble about any other
event at the meeting.
• • • *
Elliott’s most sorrowful backer was Elliott. He
spent much time and money in training for the Austral,
and he put his shirt on the final. When dead-bird meets
dead-bird then comes the bookmakers’ tug.
• • * *
A man who has never been in good condition,
but who will shine when he does get there, is Lewis.
♦ * ♦ ♦
Barden, hearing of Parsons’ five-mile victory
over Zimmerman, instantly challenged Parsons for > 200
a-side over five miles. Barden couldn’t be kidded into
racing the beaten Zim. five miles, although he has
improved much since Zim. ran him off his legs in their
famous five-mile contest. Yet now is the time for the
Zimmerman-downed cyclist to hurry to Australia, chal-
lenge Zim. and make boodle. For although Z. has come
back from his mountain trip in much better health, cir-
cumstances over which he has no control will stop him
reaching champion form this trip. Should Johnson slip
over here from ’Murka he ought to capture Zim.’s scalp
sure. What’s left of it, that is.

Exit Megson, enter Payne, say many N.S.W.
cyclists.

Crisp, winner of the Austral wheel race, was the
lightest competitor (9st.) and rode the heaviest machine
(241 b.). No less than 13 cameras were focussed on Crisp
within three minutes after he achieved his victory.

This year’s winner of the Austral Wheel Race
neither drinks, smokes, nor bets, but he’s very young at
present and may acquire those habits anon. The previous
nine winners were ordinary mortals who smoked if they
didn’t drink, or betted if they didn’t smoke, and some of
them did as Maud Hobson used to say in “In Town ”
everything.
• * • «
When Crisp and the other “ Austral meeting ”
prize-winners came to take their money they didn’t un-
pack their souls with many words. Ail their speeches
put together contained scarcely enough wind to blow the
froth off a pint of beer.
* * ♦ ♦
Paul Mell: “ Once more has the running of
the Austral Wheel-race shown up the utter defective-
ness of the handicapping in cycling competitions. Just
as Megson and Co. last year did not get a chance to race
in the final, but gave up on seeing the hopelessness of
their position, so Parsons, Walker and Pither found
themselves clean out of it last Saturday week. The pace
of the front group, handicapped half a lap ahead, was so
terrible from the jump that the chances of the back men
pulling up became nil. This was obvious before the race
was half over, and the finish was left to the front crowd, of
whom every rider had more than 200 yards start.
“ This circumstance has to be taken into account
in comparing the time of the Austral wheel-races up to
date. Crisp’s time is the shortest, but then his start was
the longest. His 4min. 41 jsecs. was not the time taken to
travel two miles, Jaut only that distance less 255 yards.
“ In considering the differences of condition in
the preliminary and final heats, it is necessary to compare
the pace of the lot. They are as follows ; -
min. secs.
Ist heat ' 4. 57 3-5
2nd „ 4. 53 1-5
3rd ~ 4. 54
4th „ (in which Crisp ran third) 4. 45 3-5
sth „ 5. 53
Final 4. 41i
The fact that Crisp’s heat was run faster than any other
except the final only proves that the placed men in it,
who started from 275yds, 210yds., 255yds, and 230yds.,
were too generously handicapped.”
* * * *
Melb. Herald gravely summed up the chances
of the various Austral candidates in exactly the same
style as the Melb. Cup review. Blank was considered to
have “a very likely looking chance,” while if Dash were
about in the last lap “ his fine sprint would make him
very hard to beat.” Also, Juggins was “doing good
work and seemed likely to effect a surprise,” and so on to
the end of the list. Not one man was put down as not

The 27th Jan., ’96, sees the biggest cash prizes

The bike reporter for Melb. Age blows a
gigantic trumpet to the glory of local champion Parsons,
and in all directions there is a disposition to overrate
him—in the present writer’s opinion. Parsons seems
always to be racing the last ounce out of himself ; he cer-
tainly looks very sick on it, whilst old-bird Martin sweats
wisely but not too much. And whereas the enthusiastic
young Vic. won £25 in stakes at the M.B.C. meeting, the
Irish-American plugger picked up £35. In the five-mile
race he let Parsons overlap him and walk in for the first
prize of £l5, after which he started to go hard for the
£lO second money and won it. Harris, the Englishman,
hasn’t distressed himself at all thus far, and will probably
not show his best Australian form whatever that may be
—before New Year’s Day.
Zimmerman makes his first Victorian track
appearance on Melbourne Exhibition oval, 21st Dec.

And the men box with full-sized gloves. Fisher is son of
an M.L. Mayor and M.P., and used to be a bank-clerk in
M.L. He is about .'iin. taller and 101 b. heavier than Valen-
tine. Fisher boxed Flacke, the Dutch giant, four rounds,
and says he had the best of it. He is amateur champion
of M.L.

Good judges aver that Waterfall may prove
quite capable of upsetting Auraria and Wallace in the
March pots. Being an undoubted flrst-classer he can’t
be laid aside, and his connections have more than a
glimmer of hope. There’s not very much difference
between the three, anyhow.

“Punter” writes “ Judging from the satis-
factory list of entries, the A. J.O. Summer Meeting should
prove quite as successful as heretofore, despite the cry of
‘hard times.’ The Villiers Stakes on Boxing Day pro-
mises to be a miniature Carrington Stakes, and Belmont,
Beau Brummel, and the best of Mr. S. Hordern’s may
furnish the winner among them. Although only nine
youngsters have accepted for the rich December Stakes,
yet they are all of the first water, and an interesting race
should be seen. Le Var will probably pull off the prize
for the Clarke syndicate, whilst Huret, Mosaic, and
Reward should prove his most dangerous opponents. In
the A.J.C. Handicap, Nobleman, if he runs, should win.
Response, Rewi, and Trier may also be seen to advantage.
“ Woodford and Quiver are at present favorites
for the Summer Cup, but the “ in and out ” running mare
will bloom later on at the Australian or Sydney Cup.
Maybe, Alcmena, Erewhon, and Kelso’s pair, Rewi and
Te Whiti, have all been given chances by the handioapper,
and, moreover, are in first-rate condition, and of the lot
Alcmena or Erewhon may perhaps prove victorious. The
ever-popular Carrington Stakes is sure to bring Out a
large field, several horses having already been backed for
it. Nobleman, Malachite, Moorefield, Coolalta, and Her
Ladyship seem very fairly treated, and the winner should
spring from this quintet. The top weight has improved
out of all knowledge, and if he incurs no penalty pre-
viously he should be capable of winning. Previous run-
ing will influence the decision of Tatt.’s Cup, but if
Mahee, Alcmena, Te Whiti, and Gozoreina are found at
the post unpenalised they should provide the winner
among them.”

The managership of the Australian Eleven will
be decided this month. Meanwhile “ Jack ” Blaokham is
in with an application for the post, and is bringing all
sorts of influence to bear. Portus (N.S.W.) is said to
have a very good show, but unless the N.S.W. Civil Ser-
vice Commission comes round soon to definitely fix his
status, he won’t risk his billet by taking extended leave
of absence.
• ♦ ♦ *
The fixtures for the next Australian Eleven in
England show that it has been hospitably treated, so far
as opportunity for making “gate” is concerned: the
team plays three matches with “Yorkshire,” and appears
prominently at Manchester, Lords, and Kennington Oval—
all places of big gate. Its hardest time, in the playing
sense, comes in between June 10 and July 5, wherein the
Australians meet Marylebone, Yorkshire, England,
Notts, Yorkshire, and North of England in succession.
Judging from present evidence, the team will lose all
three test-matches unless it can happily join forces with
the elements at the right time on each occasion. Should
Turner rejuvenate and Eady, the big Tasmanian crack
field and fast bowler, be good enough for inclusion, the
team will be pretty right in bowling. Otherwise, it will
be considerably wrong. M'Kibbin is a bowler whose
physique will not allow of him maintaining first-class form
throughout a long and arduous season; moreover, he
wants to do just a little more to be sure of going.

In reply to “J. Kop” : He certain turf-tipster
advts. that have appeared in this paper The Bulletin
can only say that it takes them for what they are worth.
A man who supplies racing tips to confiding punters for a
monetary consideration probably does his best to find
winners, and induce further application for his “dead
birds.” It is to the advertiser’s interest, seemingly, to
give his clients some cause for thinking him an intelligent
prophet. The “discretionary investment” business
is quite another matter. The question of honesty in any
sort of dealer with other people’s money concerns them
who find the cash. Some trustees are honest, whilst
others are otherwise. A discretionary investment, in Tub
Bulletin’s opinion, subjects the conscience of the trustee
to a severe strain.

DISINFECTION WITH "SANITAS.”
A searching investigation recently made by Dr. A, B. Griffiths, F.R.S.E., F.C.S., the well- ►
known Bacteriologist, lias established the fact that very minute proportions of “Sanitas ”
Fluid, “Sanitas” Oil and “ Sanitas ” Emulsion suffice to quickly destroy the microbes of
Cholera, Diphtheria, Typhoid Fever, Scarlet Fever, Pneumonia, Measles, Influenza,
Pueiperal Fever, Glanders, Yellow Fever, &c.
It has also been shown that the vapour of “Sanitas” Oil, as generated from the
“Sanitas” Disinfecting Fumigator, has a most destructive action on the germs of
disease, and that, consequently, its ii I alatio i must be most beneficial in the treatment
of Diphtheria, Phthisis, and all Diseases of the bungs and Throat.
When used k>r fumigating sick rooms, Dr. G 'i fiths’ experiments show that a short time
serves to destroy all the germs that are present in the air.
llis experiments also demonstrate that when “Sanitas” Fluid is sprayed about dwelling
rooms, the microbes of disease are entirely and quickly destroyed, and that small
quantities of “Sanitas” Emulsion equally well destroy tin same gernis when present
in water. Of great importance is the further fact which is brought out by Dr. Griffiths’
investigations, namely, that not only do “Sanitas” Disinfectants kill all disease germs,
but they exhibit this great advantage over otVr preparations—namely, that they also
destroy the poisonous substances v. hich are pro laced by disease germs and to which
they hugely owe their fearful character.
Dr. Griffiths concludes his Report with these worl -:
“There is no doubt that ‘ Sanitas ’ Oil and ' ,-’ani!as ’ Fluid are most powerful dis-
“ infectants; consequently, they should not only be used for disinfecting rooms, hospitals,
“ barracks, prisons, &c., but also employed in the treatment of infectious diseases, such
“ as cholera, diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles, glanders, typhoid fever, tuberculosis,
“ puerperal fever, &c.”

Sheridan, now lying under sentence of
death in Darlinghurst Gaol, is to be hanged on
January 7. That Sheridan will be hanged on his
“ record ” goes without saying. On March 19,
1885, Justice Innes sentenced him to 10 years’
penal servitude; and on March 25, same year,
Chief Justice Martin gave him an additional five
years. these sentences were passed upon ver-
dicts of manslaughter found by two distinct juries.
In his trial for the Jessie Nichols mishap the
Crown took no chances ; there was only one
count, that of murder, so that another man-
slaughter verdict was out of the question.

by natural means, use End’s “ Fruit Salt ”; it is
the best known remedy; it removes foetid or
poisonous matter (the groundwork of disease) from
the blood, allays nervous excitement, depression,
and restores the nervous system to its proper con-
dition ; you cannot overstate its great value in keep-
ing the blood pure and free from disease. Caution.

SKIN DISEASE
CURED BY
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. Geo. TV. Burtner, Keezletown, Ya.,
writes, as follows:
“ Shortly after leaving college, I was troubled
with a skin disease which showed itself, first, at
the ankles. Physicians pronounced it eczema,
and treated me for that complaint. The erup-
tion crept slowly up my limbs, and on the body,
until it enveloped the whole frame. It gave me
infinite trouble with constant itching, casting off
of dry scales, and a watery liquid which would
exude from under the scales. I treated it for
over three years unsuccessfully, and was unable
to check it, until I began using Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla. I used three bottles of this medicine and
was completely cured —my skin becoming as
smooth and clear as before.”

Before the boom there was in Australia a
most brilliant financier with a truly Hebrew
capacity for mental arithmetic. But he met his
Waterloo over some very smart transactions, and
got into—great trouble. Now, if you could pene-
trate into the culinary portion of a certain estab-
lishment you would see a wan man in a striped
cotton shirt peeling potatoes or quartering cab-
bages. That’s the brilliant financier ! His brain
is not much worse than it used to be, but he can
get no remunerative work for it. If a man were
valued according to his capacity instead of accord-
ing to his luck in not being bowled out, the
Government would have rushed him with an offer
of a billet in the Treasury, and given him all the
most intricate work to do at a large salary. But
he had the ill-luck to be found out, and so men of
far less capacity and perhaps of less honesty hold
the good billets, and the brilliant financier wears
a striped cotton shirt and peels potatoes for a
living. Young man, don’t be found out!

M.R.C.S.E., L.S.A., fellow of the Icelandic
Miciety of Copenhagen and F.R.G.S., and a
writer on such weird subjects as “The Human
ilody and its Connection with Man,” “ The
Forcible Introspection of Women for the Army
and Navy by the Oligarchy, considered Physi-
c 3 illy,” “ Human Science, Good and Evil, and its
“ Divine Revelation and its Works and
.Sciences,” “The Greater Origins and Issues of
L fe and Death,” “The Soul is Form, and doth
the body Make ; ” likewise translator and editor
of Swedenborg’s works, and editor of Anti-
Vaccination Tracts. From all of which it is evi-
dent that the Age might as well quote Mrs.
Mellon as an authority on criminology. Dr. Garth
Wilkinson’s extraordinary titles certainly justify
a suspicion that he is somewhat loony.

One of ex-Governor Carington’s methods
of achieving popularity was to board ships
on their arrival and paternally lecture his
new subjects with stock platitudes. On one of
these occasions, a brace of new-chum “Celes-
tials,” who apparently failed to appreciate the
gubernatorial oration, had descended the accom-
modation-ladder with a view of getting aboard a
shore boat which lay outside the smart new Govt,
launch. The coxswain of the latter, who objected
to the transfer of “ filth ” to his snowy deck, was
strenuously opposing the yellow invasion with his
best “pigeon English” and variegated “colonial”
when H.E., who had just got the last of his
benevolent injunctions off his chest, and doubtless
felt in a high condition of moral elevation, came
to the gangway, and, ascertaining the casus belli,
saw and seized the opportunity of scoring a point.
“ Johnson,” he exclaimed, in a tone of mild re-
proach, “ are not those men your fellow-creatures
and just as good as you?” “Certainly, your
Excellency ; if they are as good as you,” promptly
replied the son of Neptune. Here the gallery
laughed in the wrong place, and the star actor
yawned loudly.

Ginter’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not

We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the nterest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“Three Castles” and “ Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

With an ordinary tape measure determine th° width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heelCC,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet, of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to. If you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS’S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical hoot making is unknown,
has decided to supply his patrons at the lowest cash price.

As ELLIS'S Boots are made on specially-constructed lasts,
giving the toot an ample tread, you can wear them

Thousands of Unsolicited Testimonials;
“The hoots fit splendidly and are very cheap. You
should extend your business to N.Z., where no sucli system
is in vogue. I shall do what I can to recommend you.”
GEO. PAMMENT, Seddon-st., Kumara, N.Z. May 7, 1895.
“The hoots you made me from description of my foot
and s-lf-measurements have more thin satisfied me. I
never had a pair of such well-fitting and comfortable
hoots—so much so, that I have discarded all my old
enemies. Your price, including everything, does
not come up to the price charged here for hoots not to
he compared with yours,”—JOHN M‘ARTHUR, Police
Magistrate, Longreaeh, Queei stand. May 31, 1895.
“ I am sending you an order for two more pairs of your
bools. Those you sent me were a splendid fit, and for
workmans ,ip and durability they could not lie surpassed.
I have had them in wear now 12 months, and ther is not
a crack in them, and I have no more trouble with my in

Recently there was a slight difference of
opinion on one of the S.A. village settlements,
and, as a result, the chairman of trustees had his
nose-broken, and a fellow-trustee his jaw dis-
located and one of his ears allegedly chewed.
When the Parliamentary party of inspection
visited the settlement, they asked a prominent
settler—the proud author of the broken nose, dis-
located Jaw, and allegedly-chewed ear aforesaid—
whether there was any want of harmony amongst
the settlers, and he said he really hadn’t noticed
any trouble so far.

Webster’s International Dictionary.
Originating in a modest Spelling Hook, published when Webster was a mere student, the work has developed by
different stages, during the century or more which has since passed, into a tome of over 2000 close pages of three
columns each; replete with every addition and advantage which scholarship, literary skill, and a keen appreciation
of the requirements Of modern life can conceive,— Extract from review by Bruce Smith , Esq., Barrister-at-Law, Sydney.
from His Excellency Sir Frederick M. Barley, Kt., Lieutenant-Oovernor and Chief Justice of
New South Wales ;
Government House, Sydney, 10th July, 1895. —I purchased a copy of Webster’s Dictionary some
three years back, since which time I have had it in constant use. It is, in my opinion, a very
valuable work, and should find a place in every library.

This Dictionary is one of very great value to all engaged in scholastic wor k.
Prom J. C. Marnard, Esq., Undersecretary for Public Instruction, Sydney
Its completeness and its accuracy render it, in my opinion, the best existing Dictionary.
From P, Bridges, Esq., Chief Inspector of Schools:—
WEBSTER’S INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY.
Chief Inspector’s Office, Department of Public Instruction, Sydney. The term “Dictionary
gives but a very imperfect idea of the complete and comprehensive character of this work Whi
meeting fuHy all the requirements of a perfect dictionary, telling with clearness and accuracy all tin
should be known about words, it is also a cyclopcedia of the latest information upon all subjects <
general interest. The pictorial illustrations that abound through the body of the dictionary are <
invaluable assistance to the student, and the “Classified Selection of Pictorial Illustrations” given as a
appendix is the best of the kind that I have seen. I have had the work in constant use for seven
months, and willingly bear testimony to its excellence. It has proved more useful than I expectei
Ihe mechanical devices to facilitate reference are so good that the time and labor of looking u
information are reduced to a minimum. No one who buys this work will be dissatisfied with h
investment.
From the Hon. Sir Jorph P. Abbott, K.C.M.G.,
M.P., Speaker Legislative Assembly, Sydney :—
Speaker’s Room, Sydney,
29th November, 1895.
Webster’s Dictionary is like “good wine, which
needs no bush,” it needs no praise from myself or
anyone else. For 30 years it has weekly conferred
upon me obligations: each edition has been an
improvement upon the last, until now an edition
has been produced which, in my opinion, it is not
.possible to improve. If Samuel Johnson had
lived now and had the use of Webster’s Dictionary
he would not have written the following words :
Dictionaries are like watches; the worst is
better than none; and the best cannot be expected
to go quite true.” Webster has proved that a
dictionary can go quite true.
From the Hon. James N. Brunker, Chief
Secretary, N.S. W. :
Parliament House, Sydney,
30th May, 1895.
It is a source of gratification to me to hail the in-
troduction of Webster’s International Dictionary
to the colonies. It cannot be too highly estimated
as an important factor in the cause of education,
and 1 have every confidence in expressing the
opinion that the more widely such a valuable work
is used and circulated the more fully it will be
appreciated.
From William J. Lyne, Esq., M.L.A., Sydney :
Legislative Assembly, N.S.W.,
Sydney, sth October, 1895.
The Webster International Dictionary is a
valuable work of unique character, containing
all kinds of useful information. For ordinary
reference it surpasses any other dictionary
X* f , have “et with, and all who can
afford to do so should not fail to obtain a copy.
Fverv facility might be given, with advantage to
our children for its introduction into the Depart-
ment of Public Instruction. The knowledge con-
tained gives evidence of the great labor in compila-

Prom Sir Henry Parkes, G.0.M.G.. Sydney:
It is the renewal of an old acquaintance which I
habitually consulted many years ago, but it comes
with a new and more comely face, fuller signs of
vigorous health, and far greater fitness to be of
service to the English-speaking race. It seems to
me that for accuracy, comprehensiveness, port-
ability, and convenience of reference, it is a noble
dictionary. It is within its own covers a great
store of philological interest and learning for the
student.
Prom George Colquhoun, Esq,, Crown Solicitor,
Ne w South Wales :
It is almost impossible to write in words of
sufficient praise touching your latest edition of
that magnificent dictionary the “ Webster Inter-
national.” From the time of Johnson up to the
present day many dictionaries have been published,
all valuable in themselves ; but, to meet the grow-
ing requirements of the times, to keep pace with
the marvellous progress in science, literature, and
art of this nineteenth century, I know of no better
dictionary than the “ Webster International.” It
is the dictionary of the day. It requires no testi-
monial, for it is a testimonial to itself. It is terse,
accurate, comprehensive, and practical. Infor-
mation sparkles in every page. It is a luminous
and most valuable production, and should find a
place in every school, college, and library as a
standard authority.
Prom M. W. MacCallnm, M.A., Professor
Modem Literature, University of Sydney :
The new edition of Webster’s International
Dictionary is in my opinion one of the best and
most useful books of its kind. It covers a wide
ground, and in all the departments in regard to
which I am competent to speak shows evidence
of sound and thorough work.
Prom Professor Archibald Liversidge, Sydney
University :
I have examined Webster’s International Dic-
tionary carefully. It appears to be very accurate
and complete, even in purely scientific terms ; and
I have no doubt that those relating to other
departments of learning are equally well edited.
Like all the larger modem dictionaries, it is some- -
what encyclopaedic in character, and it contains a
very large amount of useful information for every-
day purposes.

SECRETS OF NATURE
REVEALED.
Letter from a N.S.W. backblocks black-
smith’s shop:—
A dozen chaps are ready, waiting to jump my (digging)
job. As jobs go, it’s not a bad one. Hours, from jackass
to jackass ; and on Sunday (while the boss and bossess are
gone to church) I burn and cart enough charcoal for the
week. I get paid every Monday morning regularly, and
the boss tells me that he prays for me every Sunday. It
is all in the 8 bib a week.
At Malonga, a scrubby western station,
there is a well with a history. The late owner,
who lived at Lake George, got the news : “ 100 ft.
and no water.” He said “.Sink on.” 200 ft.
“Sink on.” At 800 ft. he got vexed with the
question. “ Tell that infernal well-sinker to sink
on until he hears the cocks crowing in hell or
until he gets water.” The man was poisoned by
“fowl” air in the shaft, and perhaps fulfilled his
instructions.
In slow-going Westralia ibis reckoned that
the fastest and most reliable messenger is the
bicycle-rider. The railway comes next, then the
steamboat, then the swagman, and last of all the
telegraph. One tale ooncerns a man who started
out for a place 100 miles distant with a mob of
sheep, and sent a telegram ahead to announce his
departure. He arrived two days before the
message. Westralia is probably the only place on
earth where a sheep can beat a telegram badly on
a 100-mile race over bad country. In that cob-
webbed land even the electric fluid goes
crutches.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page
33 of this issue.
When The Bulletin quoted Bishop Julius
(M.L.) it, of course, had to leave out the naughty
little twinkle in his eye (remarks a correspon-
dent) —
I never saw so much bad coin in all my life. To offer to
the Church—the cause of God—money that the baker or
the butcher would not accept—shocks me. The man who
would do that sort Of thing wants the grace of God—or
three months.
The twinkle came with those last three words.
Julius is the opposite of a humorless person, and
the unco guid of Ballarat, therefore, held him in
much disrepute while he was there as Archdeacon.
He shocked a lot of Christians when he said they
were afraid the evolution of religion would lose
them their dear old Devil. Julius tricycled,
yachted, &0., and was a great smoker. He was
giving a magic-lantern entertainment at the dole-
ful Sebastopol one night, but had to beg his audi-
ence for a match —“I smoked all mine on the
road here.” The usual pious grocer passed up a
match, with a short sermon on the evils of tobacco.
“There’s smoke enough in hell, Archdeacon,
without having it here on earth.” At the which
Julius laughed consumedly. He once, excused a
man who was snoring through the sermon by
telling how his little son one night couldn’t get to
sleep. “Preach me a sermon, father—it will put
me to sleep like it does in church.” The Bishop
is no anaemic snnffler—he is a healthy, active,
sane man, with a sense of humor.
The only known cure for influenza is Cole-
mane and Sons Eucalypte Extract.
Ex-jockey “Johnny” Riley, of the mar-
vellous memory, assistant N.S. W. Parliamentary
Librarian, has made many a big Parliamentary
reputation. Here is a scene, not fictitious :
Enter distinguished politician. “I say, Riley, I
want to speak on the So-and-So question. Have
you got any books on it?” Riley (without hesita-
tion) : “Oh, yes. There was a debate on it, let
me see, yes, in the Commons, in ’52. We’ll find
that in volume so-and-so of so-and-so, page so-
and-so. Then there’s so-and-so and so-and-so.”
Goes out, and an hour later the distinguished
politician has a whole desk full of authorities,
debates, references, precedents, &c., to work from,
all marked at the proper page. A quarter of an
hour after, the D.P. will be holding forth to an
admiring House, an admiring press and ladies’
gallery, and an admiring country in an erudite
speech, backed up with references betraying the
most elaborate research.


The Melb. Benevolent Asylum is a seminary
for boys over 60 and girls over 50. Nevertheless,
its newspaper-boxes at the railway stations are
carefu ly sifted, to see there are no demoralising
newspapers, especially illustrated.
The most ridiculous figure in Melb. is a
well-known lanky broker, who cycles in a very long
Beaufort coat, the tails of which droop gracefully
over the hind wheel of the jigger and act as an
effective brake and mud-guard.

A SPECIALTY
For INFANTS
Specially prepared for the delicate
Shin of Ladies and Children.
Imparts and maintains a soft, velvety
condition of the Skin, and prevents
Redness, Roughness, & Chapping.
Professor SIR ERASMUS WILSON,
(Late President of the Royal College oj Surgeons, England.')
“ The use of a good Soap is certainly calculated to
preserve the skin in health, to maintain its complexion
and tone, and prevent its falling into wrinkles. Pears
is a name engraven on the memory of the oldest inhabi-
tant; and Pears’ Soap is an article of the nicest
and most careful manufacture, and one of the most
refreshing and agreeable balms for the skin.”
The independent testimony of Scientific Experts
fi nd the most eminent Shin Specialists award it
the first place among Toilet Soaps.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dark rose her shore in seas of amethyst
By tropic breezes kissed,
A summer land in watery wastes forlorn,
Her ranges floating in the snow-white mist
And gold of early morn.
The tides of Empire ebbed and flowed afar ;
The thrones of nations in the dust were hurled,
Silent she slept beneath the morning star,
A virgin world.
Love, Birth, and Death, the stress of Age and
Race,
Changed not her maiden face—
Unstocked her pastures and untilled her soil—
She who for Labor builds a throne apace
Saw not her children toil;
Down the low valleys, up the stormy steeps,
Careless, they roamed at will: the land was free
From desert stark to where the mangrove sleeps
Upon the sea.
There dropped no anchor at her river bars
Beneath the quiet stars ;
No wandering sail her silent waters swept,
By waste and scrub, o’er plain and rocky soars
No alien footstep crept;
In feathery billows of her grassy seas
Some lonely mountain stretched its capes of blue ;
Only the heavens above her and the breeze
Her secrets knew.
The ploughshare and the axe’s ringing stroke
That giant slumber broke.
She learnt the serfdom of a stronger sway,
She felt the Dawn stir in her veins and woke
To greet the larger day.
Her mighty solitudes and mountain chains
Flung wide their portals to the stranger’s tread ;
His flocks in thousands roamed her sun-lit plains—
The Past was dead.
Whei’e the wild grass grew rank on slopes forlorn
Rise fields of yellow corn
And purple lucerne-bloom makes sweet the air ;
The sullen mountain, lost in mists of morn,
Its golden heart lays bare.
Spoils of her pastures crowd full many a mart;
Her glittering treasure calls to many a land ;
She has no secrets for the daring heart,
The strong brown hand.
The smoke and thunder of her cities rise
To the same careless skies ;
Her arteries pierce the same wide sun-lit leas,
Her fleets stretch forth their wings of enterprise
O’er the same summer seas.
She to the Nations cries : “No Past, no Fame,
No Memories quicken round my flag unfurled ;
The mightier, therefore, shall I carve my name
Upon the World.”

GEO. ESSEX EVANS.
At Market wharf, Sydney, is a pet sheep
formerly used in decoying sheep on board
steamers. This animal has been taught some bad
habits by the sailors. He chews a quid with the
worst of them, and, when his coppers are hot,
presses to the opposite pub. and quenches his
thirst from the drippings of the beer taps. After
a good drink he often finds the road not wide
enough, and frequently has to be carried to his
den.
Vic. Conservator of Forests Perrin has
doubts about the old records of tall trees in Aus-
tralia. Boyle, for example, 35 years ago found,
and W. J. Caire photo’d, a eucalypt asserted to
be 470 ft. high, and named it “The Baron,” after
Botanist Von Mueller. Four years ago Perrin
had it measured exactly by a surveyor with a
theodolite, and found it only 210 ft. high, or less
than half what was alleged. Another common
yarn tells of a fallen gum on Mount Baw Baw
(hymned by Sladen) 480 ft. long as it lay, and 2ft.
through where the top had been broken off. Von
Mueller guessed the original height of this asserted
find to be over 520 ft. Perrin classes this story as
first cousin to fish yarns. He knows of trees up
to 300 ft. in several parts of Victoria and Tas-
mania, and taped a fallen blue-gum on the Huon
River (Tas.) as 330 ft. That’s the biggest un-
doubted record he knows.
Dear Bulletin, —Re alleged discovery of
aboriginal cave-paintings—or imprints—of human
hands at Woolloomooloo Bay. I see that local
authorities attribute them to an earlier race than
the present Australian blackfellows. There does
not appear to be much reason for this theory.
When i was living on a branch of the Hawkes-
bury, some years ago, I was shown a cave the
walls of which were stamped all over with dull,
red imprints of human hands, evidently similar to
those found in the Woolloomooloo cave, A very
old resident informed me that his father had told
him that the blacks, who came periodically to the
place to eat shell-fish, used to light a fire out-
side the cave, and, after killing an animal of
some sort, dip their hands in its blood, and then
in the ashes of the fire, and leave the marks of
them on the walls of the cave. He could not find
out, however, whether this curious ceremony had
any tribal or religious significance.—Crbkve Rob.
The late strike at Bindirnine reminds me,
writes a Bulletin correspondent, that a few years
ago, when strikes were looked upon as a sort of
last fearful resource calculated to bring famine
and rapine on the land, there was trouble at the
same shed. The tact and general popularity of
the manager, Mr. Jtaterson (father of “Banjo,”
by the way), smoothed over the difficulty to the
immense relief of the neighborhood. As showing
the manner of man he was, two young fellows up
that way got into trouble over the same girl—
“unbeknownst” to one another, of course. So
one went to Mr. Paterson and explained. His
governor, he remarked, was one of the old stamp
of moralists, and he was in a fix for money to
square it. “How much does she want?” “Fifty
pounds.” “Well, it’s worth that to keep your
name out of it. Here you are —pay it back when
you can.” A few days afterwards the other fel-
low confided. His trouble was valued at .£3O.
Somehow it came out that the girl was identical.
Mr. Paterson interviewed her on behalf of one
and impressed a friend to represent the other.
Later they waited on her at the same time and
compared notes. A few legal threats and she
caved in. “ .Now, my girl, hc-re’s .£2O to get away
with, but, look here—tell us who it was ? ” “Oh
I can’t tell you ! ” “ Why ?” “ Because I don’t
know ! ”
From Hergott Springs to Oodnadatta, the
present terminus of S.A.’s unfinished transcon-
tinental railway, the train —and a lamentable
“mixed” train at that—now runs once a fort-
night. It used to run once a week, but this un-
justifiable extravagance had to be knocked off.
The journey is one of 300 miles across a lonesome
waste, and at the northern end of it there is a
township of 136 people and 130 dogs. At the
southern end of this famous extension is a town of
160 people and 165 dogs. There are 15 stopping
places in the 300 miles of line, and most of them
are named Something-or-other Creek, because
there is nothing in sight except a creek; the popu-
lation of the largest settlement of the lot amounts
to 10 adults and 16 dogs. The line stops at
Oodnadatta because there is very little behind
and nothing at all in front. The only way yet
suggested to make it pay is to sentence all Adelaide
offenders, in addition to the usual fine, to make
the journey to Oodnadatta and back, and thus
establish a forced traffic. When Federation
arrives, however, that lonesome town will doubt-
less be made the Federal capital, on the ground
that it wants something done for it and its 130
dogs worse than any other town in Australia.
As a place to be not less than 600 miles away from,
Oodnadatta has no equal.
Dear Bulletin, —“ F.,” who writes re
barter in Australian bush townships, has evi-
dently “ been there.” Some years ago I was on
the staff of a Q. country rag. We compositors
seldom saw any money. Saturday nights the
boss (who wore the same paget-coat all the time
I was with him—four years) would come up to us
after “ dis.” was in, and in the same old apologetic
style break the news (?) of his impecuniosity by
remarking that he was very sorry, &c., &c., but
if we cared he would give us an order for a few
tilings “to see us over Sunday ” on Smith, the
storekeeper, who ran a quarterly advt. with him.
He would square-up on Monday. That Monday
never came. Whenever a theatrical or circus-co.
arrived in town a consultation took place among
us three “inside” as to who should collect the
account. We generally tossed up, though Bill,
who was married, got the benefit of the doubt, as
a rule. We rarely troubled the boss in such
matters. I once got measured for a pair of boots,
for which, when finished, I gave, by arrangement,
an order for the amount on my employer in pay-
ment, This was held, perforce, by the tradesman
until the end of the quarter, when accounts were
squared “ per contra.” On the departure of a
liquidating subscriber the stampede from the
composing-room to the editor’s sanctum was of an
exciting character, and even after an apportion-
ment of the cash on hand doubts were oft-times ill
concealed as to the veracity of the “boss” in
connection with his statement of the amount re-
ceived. In such Micawber-like fashion matters
proceeded until old ’s inability to part for a
bale of paper eventually suspended the publica-
tion of this typical up-country organ of light.—
Lex.
A popular Tasmanian priest entered a
local emporium to make purchases. A group o#
lady customers stood chatting to the proprietor,
and a polite shopman ran to attend the Church.
The priest winked slyly at the shopman and
nodded with a show of humorous modesty towards
the ladies, as he surreptitiously pulled up the leg
of his trousers and showed the alert shopman a
white sock. Counter-jumper seized the situation
cocksuredly, and, after a hurried word with the
proprietor which somehow caused a solemn silence
among the ladies, he proceeded to ransack the
shelves. Eventually from an obscure shelf he
dragged a cardboard-box and proudly displayed
to the blushing and indignant priest an assort-
ment of “best ladies’ white.” As soon as his
reverence recovered his breath he hurriedly
shoved the lid on the box and pushed it towards
the man with—“ Tut, man, tut, take it away
quick ; is it shame ye’d be puttin’ on me ?”
Brumby's Run.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[The aboriginal term tor a wild horse is “ Brumby.” At
a recent trial in Sydney a Supreme Court Judge,
hearing of “ Brumby horses,” asked, “ Who i»
Brumby, and where is his run ?”]
It lies beyond the Western Pines
Towards the sinking sun,
And not a survey mark defines
The bounds of “ Brumby’s run.”
On odds and ends of mountain land
On tracks of range and rock,
Where no one else can make a stand,
Old Brumby rears his stock—
A wild, unhandled lot they are
Of every shape and breed,
They venture out ’neath moon and star
Along the flats to feed.
But when the dawn makes pink the sky
And steals along the plain,
The Brumby horses turn and fly
Towards the hills again.
The traveller by the mountain-track
May hear their hoof-beats pass,
And catch a glimpse of brown and black,
Dim shadows on the grass.
The eager stock horse pricks his ears
And lifts his head on high
In wild excitement when he hears
The Brumby mob go by.
Old Brumby asks no price or fee
O’er all his wide domains :
The man who yards his stock is free
To keep them for his pains.
So, off to scour the mountain-side
With eager eyes aglow,
To strongholds where the wild mobs hide
The gully-rakers go.
A rush of horses through the trees,
A red shirt making play ;
A sound of stockwhips on the breeze,
They vanish far away !
Ah, me ! before our day is done
We long with bitter pain
To ride once more on Brumby’s run
And yard his mob again.
THE BANJO.
Vie. Parliament is getting on with a bill
to provide for the establishment of crematoriums
at cemeteries, so that the dead may be combusted
decently and in order. There are 230,000 dead in
the three Melbourne cemeteries, and as many as
22 coffins in one grave, which is about the strongest
argument in favor of cremation that could be
advanced. Think of it : a city of 450,000 living
and 250,000 dead, and only a few of them dead
long enough to be past.the putrefactive stage !

In Flood On A NORTHERN RIVER FOR THE BULLETIN.
roar 1 A swirling,, thundering, tumultuous
churning of rushing water. And rain ! How it
rained, not in drops, but walls of water, slanting
slopes of liquid, a vast cataract of sky-oceans rush-
ing down with hisses, splutters, murmurs and loud
groans, and beating on the iron roof of Captain
Saunders’ house like endless peals of musketry.
And, above the noise of the storm, the mighty
roar of the river, the howling, bellowing, menacing
rumble of the flood as it swept down the channel
and rose, inch by inch, then foot by foot, over the
flats.
It was night, and to the Captain, peering through
the window, nothing was descernible in the rain-
blackness, but the glisten of white foam when the
torrent formed a circling eddy.
“ Lucky, ” he said to him-
self, “ that I drove the stock
to the hills this morning.”
Though he spoke aloud
the batter on the roof
smothered his voice. Even
as he walked the floor he
knew the children were
awake and crying in the
next room, for he had
looked in and seen them,
but he heard them not. His
wife came to his side for a
moment and screamed in his
ear:
“Do you think the house
is safe, Alec ?”
“The house is all right.
The flood never came this
high, but the luoern’s ruined
—no crop this year, and
God knows what that means
to us.”
The wife nodded, half-
hearing, half - guessing his
meaning, and returned to
lie down by the children.
Hourspassed. The wearied
children slept, the man dozed
on a lounge, the woman
only was awake.
It seemed to her, turning
her eyes from her babe,
that the floor was sliming.
She put down her feet from
th e bed they touched water!
With a cry of terror, she
rushed to her husband,
splashing as she went, and
shook him.
“Alec! Alec! We must
leave the house. The flood
is rising ! ”
The captain rose quickly
and, for a few minutes,
waded frantically up and
down the room; but he
shook his head at the pro-
posal to escape.
“ Remember, the house is
on piles. There must be four
feet of water all round us.”
Even as be spoke the water
had risen to their knees.
Then it went over the chairs,
the tables, so that they has-
tened to remove the ch Finn
and themselves to the loft
above.
And still the w.wiir rose. Cooped there, the
sloping iron overhead, the rising water beneath,
they were trapped. A sheet of iron must be
raised, but how do it without tools ? The captain
looked about in despair. At last he remembered
the bed-head, and, stooping down, unscrewed the
top bar. With this as a lever he broke the bat-
tens, broke the bar itself, and at last, half-tearing,
half-bending, the corrugated sheets, a hole was
made in the roof.
It was time. Already the water was ankle-deep
in the loft. He climbed out on to the ridge, and
one by one the children are dragged up beside
him. Last came the wife.
Then the house rocked.
“My God !” cried the captain, “she has lifted
off the blocks. ”
Feeling, but not seeing, each other, huddled,
clinging together on the cold ridge-capping, they
felt the house moving and turning round and
round.
They could see the shimmer of shining water all
around and dark masses looming up and floating
by. Perhaps other dwellings, sheds, stacks, trees
or what not. Fortunately, the house floated and
kept upright, but it was drifting rapidly and more
rapidly.
The man groaned.
It might have been an hour they clung there,
helpless, numb, despairing, when a huge manogany,
rolling and tossing in the stream, struck the house
on one angle. The building healed over broad-
side, shook, trembled, then rising again like a boat
after a squall, continued its course.
The captain, holding on to the stove-pipe, had
gone right under water ; now in the darkness he
felt about for the wife and children that had been
clinging to him. Slowly he crept along, groping
in the darkness like a blind man. The house
swayed and rocked in the curftnt, the deluge of
rain beat on him, but he heeded it not. Foot by
foot he progressed, calling out “ Mother! mother !
are you there ? ” The sound of his voice was lost
in the storm. More slowly he crept, fearing to
know the truth, fearing to come to the end of the
house and the end of the hopes.
“ Mother 1 mother 1 are you there ? ”
He was on the extreme edge of the gable. No
one else was there, he was alone. But he would
not believe it—would not be convinced, but crawled
aimlessly to and fro on the rocking house-top,
clinging with one hand and stretching out the
other into darkness, space and rain, as though
those he sought had dodged him like players at
blind man’s bluff.
In the grey of dawn, 10 miles down the river,
the rescue-boat, pilot Gibson steering, pulled out
into the back water.
A boiling, churning, yellow current, whirling
round in eddies and thick with slime and silt, and
floating on its surface a show-ground of farm pro-
ducts, houses, sheds, ricks, dead cattle, horses,
pigs, and a vast litter of pumpkins, maize-stalks,
and melons.
The boat pulled through this silently ; even the
dead face of a woman, looking at them for a
moment as an eddy brought her to the surface,
did not arrest their steady pull. They came not
to save the dead, but the living.
In the distance, bearing down on them, they
could see a floating house-top, a man astride at
one end moving his hands with strange motions.
They called to him. There was no reply. They
shouted. He did not even turn, but with his eyes
set straight in front he bent from time to time his
head over a projecting stove-pipe, moving his
hands up and down, up and down like a steers-
man turning an invisible wheel. What was he
doing ? They pulled towards him.
“ Catch the line, Saunders !” cried Pilot Gibson,
as he stood up in the boat and threw the coil on
his arm, up and over the roof.
“ What do you take me for?” replied Saunders,
not turning his head. “Do you think I want a
pilot—l that have been on this river man and boy
for 10 years !” Then bending his mouth to the
stove-pipe and moving his hands vigorously—
“ Easy a-head !—stop her !”
“ Here, none of your shiannikin, skipper. Get
down in the boat. You are going out to sea,
man.”
“ I tell you, Gibson, I know the river as well as
you —as well as any man on the coast. I’ve got
the tide, and I mean to be home to-night; the
wife’s waiting for me.”
Again the speaker moved the invisible wheel
with his hands; again he bent to the stove-pipe.
“ Full speed ahead there ! Let her rip 1 ”
“ The skipper’s looney ; ho thinks he is on his
old steamer again,” said Gibson to the rowers.
“We must pul! him off if he won’t come.”
With difficulty they made fast to the house, and,
aided by a boat-hook, the pilot climbed the sloping
roof. But the captain dodged him.
“ I tell you I don’t want a pilot. I’ll navigate
this river with my eyes shut. I tell ”
Gibson made a grab, the captain a step back, a
slide, a splash and he was in the water. Saunders’
head rose to the surface as he swam.
“ I tell you, the wife is waiting for me. The
wife is waiting ”
They had not time to cry out, not time to warn
him, when a great snag, whirled about like a
straw in the current, bore down on the swimmer,
buried him in a rush of surge and foam, pressing
him down into yellow slime and undertow. And
as they looked, the man, the snag, all had vanished
in the mighty rush of waters onward to the sea.
HENRY FLETCHER.
Ed. Bulletin.— The era of Scotch Gover-
nors in Australia has not quite gone : Lord
Lamington, who comes to Bananaland, claims
connection with William Wallace—and with at
least as much right as Brand does with John
Hampden, Brassey with the Sieur de Bressi, and
Buxton with (say) Beer-Sheba. Lamington is in
a bleak part of Lanarkshire—the parish church
was described by Burns in these lines :
As oauld a wind as ever blew ;
A caulder kirk, and in’t but few ;
As cauld a minister ne’er spak;
Ye’se w’ be bet ere I come back.
So the Cochrane-Baillies have a private Episcopal
chapel of their own, with chaplain and all com-
plete.— A. B.
One breezy afternoon Gov. Loftus, while
cruising about Sydney harbor in a launch, saw a
canvas-dingey turn turtle, after the manner of its
kind, and told his coxswain to proceed to the
rescue. On arriving within hail, the crew (crews
at that time in these craft were limited to youths
under 16) greeted the rapidly-approaching launch
with objurgatory injunctions to “sheer off,” fear-
ing damage to their slender spars and dainty
gear. They were as much at home (and very little
wetter) outside as inside their cockleshell, and
preferred to await the services of a passing pulling
skiff. However, they graciously permitted their
would-be rescuers to collect the bottom boards,
etc., which were floating around. While taking
delivery of the salvaged “flotsam” one of the
young amphibians inquired of the coxswain of the
launch in a very audible sotto voce “ Who that
—— old was sitting in the 4 starn ?’ ” On
being informed as to the identity of the august
personage thus libellously indicated, the irreve-
rent youth expressed his incredulity in scarcely
less complimentary terms. It is characteristic of
the old diplomat that his only comment on the
occurrence, delivered when the capsized craft had
been left far astern, was “ O’ Keefe ! how very
abrupt these Australian lads are ! ” But the
Governor never attempted to rescue any more
canvas-dingey boys.

The Abolition of Titles of so-called “ nobility.
Ihe public eye rejects as uninteresting* more
than half of what appears in the newspapers o
the day. It is only the remainder that is fount
in The Bulletin.
Ihe Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti
cally-condensed columns all matter that is nql
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains
ami has become the representative Australia!
journal, because it possesses a vitality lackec
by the countless news paper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spenl
arge fortunes.
Ihe Bulletin's conductors claim that every
prog tussive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to protit by ir. s example
and follow its lines. The Jesuit of its powerful
innuenee and its unprecedented bteniry and com-
meici.il siu'pi'ss c.xu <it ohog In* seen hy cjoinprirliip
the mel hods pm sued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the (late of The Bulletin's inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name, they are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the om* completely non-
local and distinctly uni Australasi.in news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class orbiting
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical, it points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
Ihe Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth
power, and privilege—the direct cause of hair the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the churns of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, avainst thedark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the. ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared hy its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quot* d in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Ear North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than and
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.
