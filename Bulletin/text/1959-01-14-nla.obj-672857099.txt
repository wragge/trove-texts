OF TIME AND THE NICK
There can’t be many, if any, books
like Frank Norman’s Bang to Rights
(Seeker and Warburg).
Most books about prison are written
by men who have been put in for some
uncommon crime, or by accident, or
for an act they either thought was right
or clearly couldn’t help. So they are,
as far as is possible in the circum-
stances, outsiders, and their view of
prison and prisoners, no matter how
objective, is essentially something of
a visitor’s view.
Not so with Frank Norman. Illegiti-
mate son of a costermonger, he spent
most of his depression and war-time
childhood in institutions and with rela-
tives of his father, and evidently drifted
into petty crime as easily as under-
privileged and insecure children are
supposed to do. At 28 he has done four
terms. This book is about the last of
these—and, he hopes, the last of all.
It is, then, the nearest one has seen
to the real insider’s view of “inside”—
the voice of the solid citizenry of the
nick: those to whom a lagging is simply
a part of life’s routine.
This horse’s - mouth feeling is
strengthened by Norman’s style. The
publishers have printed his manuscript
just as he wrote it, complete with
atrocious grammar, punctuation and
spelling—even the obvious slips of the
pen. He is a born storyteller, and he
writes as you would imagine he talks.
You feel there must be hundreds like
him who would tell much the same
story if they could only “get it down.”
He talks with a wonderful and shock-
ing bluntness about the waste and
ineffectuality of such things as “correc-
tive training” as a means of reform;
how little of the desired effect it has on
prisoners. You see and talk to gover-
nors, psychiatrists, ministers and out-
side do-gooders as one who has seen
and talked with them not once but
dozens of times and knows, with comic
resignation, everything they are going,
so uselessly, to say. “They” just can-
not understand. It is all a monstrous
joke.
But there is no self-pity about it.
It is shrewd, ribald, sad and some-
times wildly funny. When the
prison’s English-teacher asked her
class to write a dramatic plea by a
condemned man for his life Norman
wrote something that tells much about
himself and the attitude of his mates; —
My name is Brodnick Gustavs-
berg, I am bergermaster of the sleep
little hamlet of Whitechaple in the
Bolverian alps. My reason for not
wishing to die at the present time is,
I am a very active member of the
underground especailly on the Inner
Circle, although I can make myself
quite busy on the Barnet & Cock-
fosters line’s. This naturally makes
me a key man in our little mob. But
I would still be willing to die, if it
was’nt for my deep and passionate
love of Frankferters and Saukraut
whom I regard as my whole life, in
fact one might say they are indis-
pencable to my well being, in fact
again I say indispencable.
In addition to this I am both a
physickal and moral coward so you
see you must count me out, whether
you draw straws, cards or little
pictures on the wall.
But then, a little later, alone in his
cell: —
I would find myself straining my
ears to hear a sound any sound, so
long as it was a sound. Some times
I might hear the geezer across the
landing snoring loudly, or I might
hear some one crying very faintly,
just a quiet and desperat sobbing, it
was the crying of a man who had
given up in despair, and there was
nothing left to do but cry. It was
as if he was crying for all of us. I
would cover my head with the
blankets and try to sleep, but I could
still hear sobs even when I put my
fingers in my ears to shut out the
sound. For it was I who was crying
now.
His narrative gift reminds you at
times of Damon Runyon and O. Henry,
and you wonder whether this is just
the one book the man had in him, or
whether it will give him the confidence
to go on and do a piece of first-class
fiction about the inarticulate world he
comes from, or whether it will only
make him fatally self-conscious.
And at the end it is with something
like shock that you realise you are not
after all on the lags’ side of things but
on “theirs.” This shock is the measure
of the book’s peculiar value.

Sharks
Sydney surgeon Dr. V. M. Copple-
son, author of Shark Attack (Angus
and Robertson), is no “self-constituted
authority”; he began collecting facts
about sharks more than 20 years ago,
when asked by the Surf Life Saving
Association to contribute an article on
shark-bite to its Handbook. In 1933
his essay in the “Medical Journal’’ on
shark-attacks in Australian waters
drew world-wide interest; in 1935 he
was called in on the world’s greatest
shark-story, to examine with Dr.
Palmer, the Government Medical
Officer, the arm of the Shark Arm
mystery.
In Parts II and 111 he reports shark-
attacks since 1919, when surfing be-
came popular, in Sydney waters,
N. S. Wales, Queensland, the Barrier
Reef, the Pacific and the United States;
and in the appendix these are repeated
and expanded, with references to Aden,
Argentina, Bahamas, Bermuda, China,
Columbia, Costa Rica, Cuba, East
Indies, Egypt, Fiji, Greece, Haiti,
Hawaii, Hong Kong, India, Ceylon,
Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Madagascar,
Malta, Mauritius, Mexico, New Cale-
donia, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Pago
Pago, Panama, Persian Gulf, Papua
and New Guinea, Philippine Islands,
Red Sea, Salvador, Singapore, Solo-
mon Islands, Wake Island, Yugoslavia
and the Zambesi River.
These places are brought together,
he says, by the shark-belt he plots on
a double-page plate. A blue strip
spreading both sides of the Equator
represents sea-temperature constantly
above 70 degrees Fahrenheit; in this
area sharks will attack any time in
the year. Lighter shadings both sides
of this strip represent the summer
seasons north and south of the Equator
when sharks go as low as Melbourne
in February, and as high as Boston
(U.S.), the Mediterranean and Japan
in August.
A further plate, “The Sharks’ Time-
table,” shows that the farther north you
live on Australia’s eastern coast the
more likely you are to be bitten. From
Melbourne to Wollongong the sharks
have to get you in January or February;
from Wollongong to Newcastle they
have the four months, December to
March; from Newcastle to past the
Macleay River they have the five
months, November to April; from
the Macleay River to Byron Bay, six
months, October to May; from Byron
Bay to Yeppoon, seven months,
September to June . . .
Another theory Dr. Coppleson puts
a strong case for, adducing instance
after instance of a series of attacks
during one or two years on one section
of coast —and then no more—is the
theory of “the rogue shark”—i.e., a
shark which takes a pleasure in biting
human-beings, and tends to hang
around where the biting has been good.
As to dealing with sharks. Dr.

FACING THE AXE AGAIN
JOHN JOSEPH CAHILL may not
** be the seventh son of a seventh son,
but devotees of numerology could
possibly find something significant in
the fact that he is the seventh Labor
Premier of New South Wales, and that
if he wins the coming election his party
will have won seven elections in suc-
cession and will be set to complete
three times seven years’ of office.
If any superstitious member of his
party offers this information to Cahill
as a promising augury for the poll he
had better be careful not to remind
Joe that at the 1956 election he lost
seven seats and held a further seven
by fewer than 700 votes. Numerology
won’t beat Joe, but the Liberal and
Country parties are optimistic that
numbers will.
Not that beating Joe is a simple
task. It’s a pastime that has already
beaten two Liberal leaders. Pat
Morton inherited the job towards the
end of 1955 and had to lead the party
in an election-campaign almost before
he’d had time to get used to leading it
in the House. Even so. in alliance
with Country - party leader Mick
Bruxner. he came within an ace of
putting Joe out. At close of counting
on the night of the poll, with five seats
in doubt, Labor was still short of a
majority. The final count gave all
these seats to the Government, but
for a brief period Cahill and his Minis-
ters really felt the draught.
It was in the course of that campaign
that Cahill, rattled perhaps by the
coldness of his reception on his country
tour, said slightingly of the 73-year-
old leader of the Country party: “That
aged Country-party warrior, Mr.
Bruxner, has called again for his boots
and saddle. He creaks his way through
the outback electorates in the spirit of
Destry Rides Again.” Bruxner retorted
that the Cahill Government had made
such a mess of transport that it was just
as well he was able to make use of his
boots and saddle. “I may be an aged
warrior,” he said, “but I can still throw
Joe.”
The old warrior didn’t succeed in
throwing Joe—though the combined
team gave him rather a shaking—but
a younger Country-party warrior, Davis
Hughes, threw Joe’s namesake out of
Armidale and has since climbed into
Bruxner’s boots and saddle as leader
of the Country party.
TRAVIS HUGHES and Morton seem
to have developed a fairly good
working-arrangement. A joint policy
will be agreed upon for the election,
and the number of seats in which the
two parties will oppose each other has
been reduced to four Labor-held elec-
torates —Dubbo, Mudgee, Liverpool
Plains and Young. This perennial dis-
pute will probably not be resolved until
one or other of the Opposition parties
wrests the seats from Labor. In 1956
Liverpool Plains gave two votes to the
Country-party candidate for every one
it gave to the Liberal, but in Mudgee
the tally was four to three in favor of
the Liberal. The scores were closer in
Dubbo and Young, with the advantage
slightly in favor of the Country party.
Morton seems to be out of favor
with the Sydney press—an experience
which also came the way of his two
predecessors. For many years the man
at the head of the State Liberal party
has been handicapped by a “friendly”
press which is not satisfied that he
should oppose the Labor Government
in his own way, but insists that he
should oppose it as and when the press
dictates, and especially that he should
call for a royal commission whenever
a daily newspaper demands one. Every
few months the Opposition-leader is
placed in a position where he has to
choose between looking like a stooge
of the press or being attacked by it for
refusing to be one.
At the coming election Cahill will
be faced with a problem he didn’t have
to worry about in 1953 or 1956, and
which didn’t concern his predecessors
—the intrusion of the D.L.P. into State
politics. In nothing has the man from
Cook’s River shown himself so adroit
• a politician as in his ability to keep
clear of the schism that split the
Labor party in 1955, wrecked Labor
- Governments in Victoria and Queens-
land. brought open sectarianism into
politics and dashed all hopes of an
Evatt-led Federal Government.
Walking the tightrope, sitting on the
fence, skating on thin ice, balancing
on a razor’s-edge, running with the
hare and hunting with the hounds,
having his cake and eating it, too,
taking the best of both worlds —are
all cliches which have been used to
describe Joe’s dexterity at holding his
post while all around him fell. And
they are all correct. Joe is renowned
as an early-morning swimmer, but one
has to get up very early to find him wet.
The muster-roll of the N.S.W.
Parliamentary Labor Party contains as
heterogeneous a collection of types as
was ever bound together by a common
name and a common desire to retain
its Parliamentary privileges at all costs.
Evatt-lovers and Evatt-haters; Leftists
and Rightists; Groupers and anti-
Groupers; clericals and freethinkers;
landed gentry and Sydney City Council
tenants —they’re all there, moved by an
instinct of self-preservation to put their
differences and their consciences in
their pocket and vote as a solid body
when the party-whip cracks.
At the Federal election in November
the D.L.P. vote was not very high in
N.S.W. —in most electorates no more
than a couple of thousand—but the
ominous fact for Cahill is that it
doesn’t need to be very high to put him
out of office. His majority is only two
in a House of 94, so he can’t afford
to lose any seats at all this time. In
fact, with the D.L.P. in the field he
can scarcely afford to lose any votes
at all—in Concord, for example, his
majority at the last election was 87; in
Ryde, 42.
It is cold comfort to point out that
the D.L.P. doesn’t draw all its votes
from the A.L.P.; that a considerable
proportion come from former Liberal
supporters. Experience in the Victorian
and Federal polls shows that on the
distribution of preferences most of
these votes return to the Libs.; but
most of the votes the D.L.P. draws
from Labor are gone for keeps. So
far the D.L.P. hasn’t announced its
policy on preferences; Cahill and Co.
are no doubt keeping their fingers
crossed.
■pOR election material Joe has just
about scraped the barrel. His oft-
repeated housing- and public-works
promises must by now sound hollow
even to himself, and he has blamed
Menzies so often for his financial plight
that the accusation begins to sound
like a joke without having the virtue of
raising a laugh. His half-hearted equal-
pay bill and his annual-leave gift were
no doubt intended as election-bait, but
their value is debatable. There’s the
Defamation Bill. . . but, then, the dead
can’t vote.
If ever a Government was ripe
for the axe it was this same Cahill
Government three years ago. The
chopper fell, but the tough old bird
was able to stagger away from the
block with its neck noticeably hacked,
but still in one piece. It has been
sticking that same neck out with
increasing arrogance ever since. If the
people of N.S.W. allow it to survive
another challenge it will be entitled to
consider itself invulnerable, if not
immortal.


"UNDER BELOW!"


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Mew Despotism
Out of the jungle of bureaucracy on the
Molonglo, which every month grows
thicker and more infested with highly-
paid and bemedalled lions, came a Con-
stitutional human voice speaking wisdom
—a strange thing in the silly season of
the last week in the Old Year.
It belonged to the venerable Professor
F. A. Bland, M.P. for Warringah, warn-
ing, in the light of “recent attacks on our
liberties” and the public reactions to
them, of the need for the separation of
Parliament and administration.
He proclaimed what used to be taken
for granted in Parliamentary circles—
i.e., that “Parliamentary democracy owes
its existence to our observance of the
rule of law, and to our providing that
the functions of legislating and of
Government should always be left to
separate bodies.” He added that where
this is not the case, “there is always a
contingent threat to our liberties.”
He continued that Parliament has
tended increasingly of late to abdicate
from its primary function of exercising
a control over Government on behalf of
the people, and to invest officials with
power to make and police laws and to
adjudicate upon conflicts that arise in
interpreting such activities. “Hence the
rise of the New Despotism.”
The occasion of Professor Bland’s
warnings was a statement by Mr. Cahill,
who has gone so far along the road of
the “democratic centralism,” which is
also known by the name of Communism,
that a few days before he had held
that “the Government makes the laws and
is responsible for their execution.”
As the Professor remarked, “some of us
have thought Parliament makes the laws
and not the Government,” and “have
resented the usurpation of that power by
the Government by its use of majorities
to gag measures through the Parliament
without sufficient and effective debate.”
Deakin and the men who made the
Australian Constitution must have turned
over in their graves when they heard Mr.
Cahill’s elaboration of his theory of rule
to the point at which he contends that the
Government is responsible for executing
the laws through officials —who are, as
Bland points out, “in the nature of things
a pliant instrument of the Fxecutive.”
This position under present circum-
stances (says Bland) provides “all the
elements of a tyranny unless recourse
can be made to the courts against decrees
of officials.” Also, he might have added,
unless Parliamentary members consider
themselves as the sources of power and
not merely as rubber-stamps to endorse
on party lines any decision Ministers care
to make as to legislation or as to acts of
administering the Government.
Professor Bland is not the pioneer in
protest about this matter. The late
Archie Cameron, when Speaker of the
House of Representatives, repeatedly
clashed with the Government over the
relentless manner in which Parliament
House was invaded by administrative
departments in flat defiance of all the
principles of Parliamentary government.
They even came to the point of deciding
who should occupy what rooms and what
uses should be made of the Chamber
itself. His warnings about what was
happening went unheeded and even were
received with derision by the daily press
which is now so alarmed and vocal about
every new advance towards commissar-
government.
The real drift began during the war-
time Labor regimes, when the Ministry
was told what to do by the union juntas
and in turn —sometimes having invited
the outside bodies to formulate its policy,
as Mr. Chifley did in the case of defence
after the war —instructed the caucus
majority what was to be done.
The plan, however, has achieved a new
status during the past near-decade of
Liberal administration, during which,
save in two or three departments, policy
and plans are made by virile civil servants
acting on feeble Ministers, or by strong
Ministers backed by eager civil servants,
and handed to Parliament to rubber-
stamp.
The main difference between the
totalitarian systems of Eastern Europe
and the Australian system is that there
are genuine elections in Australia and the
Opposition is at least allowed to criticise,
though only within time-limits that
please the Government concerned, with-
out being shot at dawn or exiled to Dood-
lakine.
But these refinements for consolidating
the power of the bureaucrats, Ministerial
or otherwise, and reducing Parliamentary
power to ghost-strength will no doubt
come in time as the civil service grows
more arrogant and the back-benches of
majorities weaker and more pliant.
Pub Licences Going Cheap
Political hesitation in the face of licens-
ing-law problems is familiar but exas-
perating. With five more Victorian hotels
surrendering their licences as the Old
Year ran out, it began to appear that the
Government might be forced to handle
something that Governments and politi-
cians generally treat as dynamite. Bolte’s
Liberal Government did well in 1956 to
give Victorians at last a chance to say, by
referendum, on a non-party basis,
whether they wanted 10-o’clock closing
instead of 6-o’clock. By a plain majority
they decided that they didn’t want a
change.
Bolte then aired a suggestion, which
had merit, of making a distinction
between hotels which actually, and not
merely nominally, catered for the public
with meals and accommodation, and
those which existed basically for the bar-
trade. The idea was to reduce licence-
fees for the hotels proper and to raise
them for the tavern. In other words, to
make legal and practical a distinction
that would encourage the “house” trade
and leave a due place for licensees of
what are mainly bars.
Nothing has come of it so far. The
Government was expected to bring down
some legislation in the pre-Christmas
session, and didn’t. Fears of the possible
hostility of the Labor and Country
parties—which, combined, can still out-
vote the Government in the Upper
House—were said to be among the
reasons for deferring it. But, with a fast-
growing population and some operators
finding it unprofitable to make the
improvements the Licensing Court
demands, an alarming number are going
out of the business. This may strengthen
Bolte’s hand if he can rediscover his
courage to attempt a licensing reform
without a referendum.
Taxation in New Guinea
[From Canberra]
The European population of Papua and
New Guinea may this year lose their
Utopia of tax-free income.
The Commonwealth Department of
Territories, at the request of its Minister,
Mr. Hasluck, has compiled a 300-page
report on the question of taxing
Europeans in the Territory.
It is believed to have recommended
that individuals should be taxed at 60
per cent, of the rate applicable on the
mainland, and companies should be
taxed 4s. in the £, compared with 7s. 6d.
in the £ imposed on profits of public
companies in Australia.
The taxation, if applied, would affect
about 25,000 non-native population.
The report states that it had recom-
mended a lower rate of taxation than
that applying on the mainland to
stimulate residence and investment in
the Territory.
Mr. Hasluck was at pains last week
to point out that the report was merely
a departmental document and was not
a statement of Government policy.
He said Cabinet had not yet con-
sidered the report but would do so later
this year.
Not Cricket
[From Canberra]
English pressmen touring with the
M.C.C. team were not the only critics of
fast-bowler lan Meckiff’s rout of the
English bats in the second Test at
Melbourne.
Prime Minister Menzies had oblig-
ingly arranged a Cabinet-meeting in Mel-
bourne on the Monday so that the cricket-
followers in Cabinet could watch the last
day’s play in the second Test on Tuesday.
While Cabinet was bowling-over its
business as quickly as possible to finish
by Monday afternoon, leaving Tuesday
free, Meckiff was also doing some
bowling-over of the English bats.
Meckiff was too good for both the
Englishmen and the Cabinet Ministers,
and long before Cabinet had finished its
deliberations, the Australian Test-
cricketers were celebrating their victory
in the customary way at the M.C.G.
Still, with no Cabinet this week, Mr.
Menzies and some of his colleagues
managed to glimpse some of the play in
the third Test as a consolation-prize.


Reforming Forms
Queensland Premier Nicklin has
launched a crusade which is quite non-
political and which deserves the support
of electors of all political colors. He has
declared war on longwinded departmental
forms and has asked all departments to
review their forms and to see that they
are made as simple and as clear as
possible.
As every citizen spends an increasing
proportion of his time at the unremunera-
tive and often exasperating task of form-
filling, he has a right to expect Govern-
ments to co-operate in seeing that the
forms with which they bombard him
make the lightest possible demands upon
his time.
Nicklin’s example is one that could
well be followed in other States and in
Canberra, even though there might be
some difficulty in finding dumping-
grounds for the surplus verbiage hacked-
out of existing forms. The test he has
laid-down for the ideal form asks:
1. Is it in the plainest, simplest terms
possible?
2. Is every word necessary?
3. Does it require the minimum amount
of information the department must
know?
4. Is the paper-size the most economical
that will serve?
The Queensland Premier hopes for a
twofold gain from the campaign—the
public will find the forms easier to under-
stand, and the smaller size made possible
will be more economical.
A. P. Herbert would approve Nicklin’s
action. As an Independent member of
the House of Commons he never missed
an opportunity of condemning depart-
mental jargon—and he got results, too.
Churchill was another who tried to bring
official English down to earth, though he
never forgot that a preposition is “a
part of speech with which you must not
finish a sentence.” Quoted almost as
often as Churchill’s war-time speeches is
his memo, scrawled on one verbose
departmental report: “This is an example
of stilted and bastard English up with
which I will not put.” Nicklin isn’t likely
to equal that, but he has started some-
thing that is well worth while.
Russia Goes All Liberal
With the arrival of fuller reports, the
evidence of some disturbance in Russia
became more marked and the external
atmosphere more curious. The Supreme
Soviet which met on Christmas Day
promulgated six new laws and three
decrees concerned with justice, some of
which amount to a judicial and legal
revolution.
Of course, they need mean nothing,
for the whole system of- Russian justice
is dependent upon interpretation by the
highest powers of the Kremlin on whom
there is no Constitutional check, there
being no Parliamentary Opposition and
no free press, radio or right of public
criticism.
It would be impossible to imagine in
any Western country a sweeping Consti-
tutional alteration being brought-down
by a Government absolutely without
prior public notice. The six bills and the
three decrees passed through all stages
and were given “Royal” assent on one
day, without any critical debate in two
Houses of Parliament aggregating 1347
members.
Yet that is what happened in relation
to six measures which abolished the
crime of being “an enemy of the people,”
which made the person on the receiving-
end due for a bullet in the back of the
neck without any hampering ceremony —
raised the age of criminal responsibility
from 14 (in some regions 12) to 16, and
defined the crimes for which the death-
penalty could be inflicted as treason,
espionage, terroristic acts, banditry and
premeditated murder under aggravated
circumstances. (The measures also
abolished deportation, banishment and
deprivation of citizenship, altered the
basis of remissions of sentences and
formally established “propaganda for
war” as a criminal offence.
It was also decided to abolish the
system under which, if there was no crime
in the code to fit the case of any lady
or gentleman whom the Administration
was anxious to scrag, he or she could
be immolated by “finding the crime which
is nearest to it and applying its penalties.”
This shows how far the Kremlin is—
or appears to be—prepared to go in the
cause of freedom and justice. Any
awkwardness or restriction of power to
act which it feels will no doubt cease
to persist when Comrade Khrushchev
reflects that it is still up to him or his
personal myrmidons to define the mean-
ings of words such as treason, which
hitherto might mean anything from fail-
ing to put bitters in a Soviet Prime
Minister’s vodka to taking a British lady-
secretary to the pictures.
There is also now a new “principle”
that “while presumption of innocence is
not accepted, the burden of proof of
guilt is now on the prosecutor.” Hitherto
it has been an accepted rule of
“justice” in Russia that on arrest the
victim of the law was adjudged guilty
and was not brought to the court to
make inconvenient denials. He was kept
on ice until ready to confess at length.
The hundreds-of-thousands of confes-
sions on record in Russia in almost
exactly the same words is a striking
evidence of the neat uniformity of
Russian minds.
As an earnest that all this is genuine, a
charming new Security Chief, formerly
secretary-general of the Komsomol and
conveniently well known to foreigners
attending youth festivals in Moscow,
has been appointed in place of the
dreaded Serov. In some of the glamorised
portraits of him issued for Western con-
sumption he appears to be wearing an
Old Etonian tie, but he is certainly no
Old Etonian. On his past record he is
merely a good Old Stalinist, with an
acrobatic mind which has rendered it
quite easy for him to become a new
Khrushchevian. His past achievements
include a mass-campaign to wipe-out
religion among Soviet youth.
All in all, the changes which have been
so much acclaimed mean nothing at all.
An Administration which can get a two-
House Parliament without debate to
abolish a heap of abuses (or seem to
abolish them) by a mass-passage of un-
debated bills on one afternoon can quite
easily persuade the same pliant bodies
to revoke the decision next morning and
to allow the Government and the courts
a free hand to interpret the changes as
they will.
Promoting Wool
Across the chorus of Melbourne voices,
all quite authoritative in their own pro-
fessions but rather louder than usual at
present, discussing what should be done
to promote wool, has come the loudest
voice of all: that of Douglas Cox, chair-
man of the National Association of
Garment Industries.
Mr. Cox, who is a Melbourne manu-
facturer of clothing, has said the garment-
manufacturers had been forced to cut
their orders for woollens in half because
of two disastrous seasons; last season
some woollen garments sold at one-third
of cost price, and the garment industry
was therefore forced to subsidise wool,
especially in an adverse season.
In this last claim Mr. Cox is making
an obviously exaggerated claim; if it
were true, it could be as justly claimed
the garment-manufacturers were living on
the wool industry in a good season.
There is almost unanimity among the
experts, however, that wool is under-
promoted and the advertising approach
of the industry to the consumer out-
moded. A significant point of general
agreement on this phase emerging from
the discussions was that the Australian
Wool Bureau’s total annual budget for
world promotion would buy only, for
instance, second-class advertising in the
U.S. alone.
There also is a general agreement that
the man-made fibres have been pro-
moted with incomparably more imagina-
tion than wool, and that it must be
conceded that the exclusive use of wool
in many types of garments, especially
underwear, has ended.
W. A. Gunn, chairman of the bureau,
hopes to announce this month details of
a new promotion plan ; but some of the
shrewd men long engaged in advertising
and promotion wonder whether this will
be as high, wide and generous as the
industry deserves, and certainly needs.
While these wholly sincere experts were
discussing wool as the defender and the
artificial fibres as the enemy, Sir
Alexander Fleck, chairman of 1.C.1., the
vast English company, was shaking his
head at what he regards as the wool
industry’s wrong approach.
Although he went no further than to
say he believes it is a misguided decision
to eschew any promotion in association
with the manufacturers of terylene,
nylon and orlon, he made it clear during
his short stay in Melbourne that he
regards it as a serious error.

I cooked, spring-cleaned, did most of
the housework and odd jobs that didn't
seem to have been done for years—
usually a 14-hour day. It wasn’t in Early
Victorian days, either, but in the de-
pressed 'thirties just before the war.
Other jobs at a similar rate of pay in-
cluded milking cows, making beds, etc.,
by the dozen. Now local lasses get the

A/tY first inkling that I had become

high position) 1 was halted by a stranger
who told me he had been in “one of them

went his way. During the 18 weeks I was
adorned with the contraption I was
informed by a railway employee, a
picture-show usher, a carpenter, a lady
dry-cleaner and four other strangers of
unknown occupations that they had worn
aeroplane-splints for periods varying from
10 weeks to two years. I used to wonder
what strange impulse compelled ex-
aeroplane-splintiers to go out of their
way to impart such information. Years
passed ; then just before Christmas I saw
a poor coot in a Sydney street. I felt
a perfect idiot, but I just couldn’t pass
him without saying fatuously: “Merry
Christmas to you, matey. I was in one
of those for 18 weeks.” He smiled,
nodded, and said in broken English:
“Tank you verra much.” Our fraternity

menacingly like hungry werewolves out-
side the timid fold of a flock of helpless
sheep”; when the field was “spread wide
like King Farouk's waistline,” and when
a certain West Indian batting-partnership
was “like a swiftly flowing river that


gathered-up every Australian bowler in
its journey”?) Now we have to be con-
tent with a frequent reference to some
player as “the hero of a match” —our
sporting scribes have a strong taste for
“heroes”—and with quaint fancies in the
use of particular words. Thus, during
the second Test, a Sydney “Herald” com-
mentator proclaimed that England’s
bowlers had “literally achieved the im-
possible”—i.e., they had done something
that couldn’t possibly be done —and that
the way Bailey functioned was “a credit
to his fulsome knowledge of the game.”
In my own little dictionary “fulsome” is

this sentiment for a moment, then said
with obvious feeling: “Yes, but 1 don’t

several months retirement, moaned.

THE BENEFITS OF
CIVILISATION
“Tribal chiefs in Damaraland, s.-w. Africa,

payments for brides.”
The toothbrush, bra. and radio,
Drip dries, and tucker made with dough
(Which might, to them , be nutri-

These, plus the products sold by Bung,

The manifold blessings Occidental
In which Damaralanders joy.
Here’s one more thing, their hopes to
buoy :
„ The buck who’d be of bride the
claimant
May now give matrimony a fly
(With trade-in or deposit ) by
The system we call “easy” payment.
They’ll soak him interest, good and hard,
Upon his still-unpaid-for pard.
He’ll find as thorny as a briar
The charges-racket. These’ll include
An item bound to make him rude:
Insurance—“in h.-p. it's higher.”
As, forking-out year after year
By cutting-down on smokes and beer,
It’s probable he’ll vaguely wonder
If dragging on an h.-p. wife
Whom he’ll be paying-off half his life
Wasn’t an adjectival blunder.
The contract which they’ll make him
sign
Along the nicely-dotted line,
By which he’ll gain his dusky beauty,
Will make him wince whenever he
Lets his lamp rest upon the fee
They wrested from him in stamp-duty.
Yet, though the fiscal scene’s not bright,
Through the murk gleams one cheerful
light:
Should she turn out a real oppressor,
One who continuously scolds —
Well, when repayments he withholds
They’ll come along and repossess her!

The ISLAND
By
W. HART-SMITH
Men know not when they came, nor
whence.
They sowed in truth and reaped in
violence.
What did they teach ? Go ask a wiser
one.
Rumor called them Children of the Sun.
A bearded one begat them — Kukulcan,
Or Con or Viracocha. What you will.
From whom they had a teaching and a
skill.
And so they spread their mats upon the
sea
And vanished from the land in mystery.
What did they teach ? Go scratch among
the stones
Of tumbled cities where they left their
bones
Mingled with bones. And when you’ve
had your fill,
Ask what it is in man impels to kill
His kind, and bring down those who
might
Point out a way of limping to the light.
And so they spread their mats upon the
sea. ,
/ Made rafts of reeds or trunks of the
balsa-tree
Lashed together, topped with mast and
sail,
Launched to drift in calm or take the gale.
They knew that rivers huger than on land
Turn in the ocean, and could understand
That birds that cross the deserts flying
high
Seaward, seek something more than sea
and sky.
And so they spread their mats upon the
sea,
Prepared to drift and wallow endlessly
If need be, shrivelled, shrunken. Human
seed,
But quick enough to have most human
need.
Seed is contraction, life prepared to wait
In a nearly timeless, or dimensionless,
state,
A tiny foothold inside time and fate.
They found an island
Months out, a land a man might walk
around
In a single day, a speck, a slab, a ridge
Of fertile rock once thrust like porridge
Bubbling from the sea-bed, blistered, hot
and barren,
Riddled with caves and blast-holes like
a \yarren
Of devil-coneys. Cooled and took a
coat
Of grass and herbs —a perch for birds, a
moat
Of ocean round it to infinity.
So very like the moon. As if the world
In a great circle all around it'curled
Giving it life and pleasure, seed by seed,
As if it were a hungry mouth to feed.
They found it, picked it up, struggled
ashore,
And set to work as they had done before.
They set to work, for that was life to
them.
Planted their crops. Climbed to the
crater rim
And, looking down, saw marshes. Planted
reeds.
Did everything to satisfy the needs
Of mortal substance. Then started on
the soul
Which, they had decided, thrives on toil.
Toil’s purpose? Toil itself, to inner growth
Proceeding adventitiously when both
Doing and thinking are conjoined, apart,
Yet united in the triad of the heart.
They sang their songs. They carved
enormous bricks.
Made statues of the god-man. Heaved
them up with sticks
And stood them row on row, backs to
the sea
On great stone platforms, staring sight-
lessly
On those, who toiled and sang and multi-
plied.
When did they come ? Who knows. Or
whence.
Castaways in a state of innocence ?
Or warlike fellows paddling in the ocean,
Lost, starving, not a warlike notion
Surviving in them. A single state and
mood
Identified with water, land and food.
Those who loved work took those who
did not in.
The thin grew fat, the thinner stayed as
thin,
Thrust beards, hooked noses, brooding
eyes at neighbors
Soon fed and fat. And gave them vaster
labors.
Who multiplied and said, “Now let us
eat
Our crazy masters. This is our defeat
This toil. Let’s cook them in the ditch
They skulk behind. That mountain
whence they teach
,■lnhabit and be masters each for each !”
The lunar landscape pocketed with caves
Reverted to a warren filled with braves
Who crept from out their holes to hunt
each other.
From killing their teachers, turned on one
another,
Bruised their picks on bone instead of
bricks,
The lunar world a land of lunatics.
And so they spread their mats upon the
sea
Of death to drift to lands unknown to
me,
Unsolved, some here, some there. But
left a seed
That stirs and is a voice if we will heed.


POLITICAL POINTS
The rarely used Melbourne Federal
Cabinet-room came back to life for the
first 1959 meeting of the Menzies team.
It has been so little needed in recent
years that many of the newer generation
of Melburnians probably wouldn't know
even where it is—in the graceful seclu-
sion of Treasury Place. When Billy
Hughes was Prime Minister it was taken
for granted that everybody knew —and
Billy had an escape-hatch built so that
he could leave his office by a side-entrance
to escape angry deputations.
On this occasion the choice of Mel-
bourne for the first New Year Cabinet-
meeting served chiefly to bring two
reminders: that Victorians now bat Nos.
1,2, 3 and 4 in the Cabinet ; and that,
just across the Cabinet-room vista of
parks and gardens, the second Test-match
was supposed to be still going on.
(Actually it ended before lunch.) Re-
member what Menzies said during the
election? That, if he lost, he would see
all the Tests ; if he won, he’d see only
two.

Reiterating the stand he made when
the subject was raised at the Victorian
State election and when his Hire Purchase
Bill was defeated in the Legislative Coun-
cil a few weeks ago, Premier Bolte has
refused to consider a ceiling on h.-p.
interest-rates. His argument that com-
petition will keep the rate from going
too high gained some support last month
when Custom Credit reduced its rates
on a wide range of articles.
There’ll be an all-States conference on
h.-p. in Sydney this week, opening on
Wednesday. The object is to try to work-
out a uniform Australia-wide policy on
h.-p. controls. As some States are com-
mitted to ceiling-rates of interest, Bolte’s
announcement seems to suggest that uni-
formity is out of the question even before
the conference begins. However, Bolte
says that uniform legislation is desirable
“up to a point,” and that there will be
some common grounds on which all
States will be able to agree. In his view
“some issues have become only political.”

N.S.W. Liberal-leader Morton has
declared that the Liberal and Country
parties, if elected to office at the. next
election, would break the back of the
housing problem within three years. He
accused the Cahill Government of trying
to off-load the responsibility on to Can-
berra and pointed out that other States,
operating within the same framework a 3
N.S.W., had outstripped it in house-
building. Morton quoted a national
survey which showed that in the last
financial year N.S.W. completed 72
houses for each 1000 of its population.
Comparative figures for other States were
Tasmania, 77; Victoria, 82; South
Australia, 88 ; Westraiia, 91.
The Opposition parties propose to
encourage more building by co-operative
building societies ; reduce the impact of
road-tax, rail-freights and timber-
royalties on building costs; encourage
rental-building, now almost at a stand-
still.

“M.W.”: It is stated that wool’s
troubles have stemmed from the high
prices of a few years ago, which put
woollen clothing out of reach of the
public’s pockets. But have the prices of
woollen goods come down at alt since
the recent drop, and are they going to
come down further in view of the official
belief that an early price-rise of wool is
unlikely? If not, why not?

“Ex-ACT”: Our road-hogs are doing
their best, but we’re still a little behind
the Federal German Republic and the
United States in our deathrate from,
motor-accidents. It’s not much to be
proud of that we rank third in the world,
with a rate of 23.5 in 100,000, compared
to 24.5 in West Germany and 23.7 in
America. New Zealand’s rate is only
14.4, that for England and Wales only
11. —and the more cautious Scotland
only 10.8. The World Health Organisa-
tion, which collects these statistics, points
out that modern man has about as good
a chance of dying a violent death as
dying in his bed. Statistics don’t seem to
horrify anybody, but these should be
alarming enough to make all drivers
think —as well as surviving pedestrians.

[From Canberra]
Now 42,441, Canberra’s population is
expected to reach almost 50,000 in the
next 15 months. Main reason is the
influx of staffs of the Commonw'ealth
Defence departments, which starts this
week. In all, 1400 employees, plus their
families, will arrive by early 1960. And
everything is ready for them. Special
houses have been allocated to them, shops
have expanded their staffs to cope, fine
offices await the staff, and even squash-
courts are ready for those in need of
hectic exercise.
"HAIL, COLUMBIA!"


Cahill is expected to announce an
election-date this week, after considering
the arguments of those of his team who
want it early before the party loses more
ground, and those who want it late be-
cause they feel the Government has had
it and wish to postpone the crash as
long as possible. The Easter break at
the end of March seems to put a mid-
April poll out of court, and the early
school of thought will most likely pre-
vail. Parliament is scheduled to meet
on February 24, but it’s possible Joe
may plan to have the election over by
then.

As far as housing is concerned, there’s
still some measure of rent-control in
Victoria. But the flat situation in Mel-
bourne is rapidly changing to a tenants’'
market. As recently as two years ago
flats were hard to get, but today one firm
can offer a choice of 60 or 70 flats, mostly
unfurnished. Some flats are lingering a
long time empty and rents can again be
haggled over. It is estimated that open-
market flat-rentals have fallen 15 per
cent, in two years. The new blocks of
flats springing up suggest that the law of
supply and demand is coming back into
play.

Queensland’s centenary year received a
slight damper with the release by the
Commonwealth Statistician of the migra-
tion figures for the 12 months ended
September 30, 1958. In that period
Queensland lost 340 people by migration
(the figures include inter-State migrants
as well as overseas). The official explana-
tion that Queensland suffers because it
is the last State of call for ships from
Europe and most of the newcomers dis-
embark before it is reached may explain
the small numbers arriving there, but it
doesn't explain why more people left than
arrived. In recruiting workers for the
canefields the experiment was made of
routing a few vessels around the north
of Australia, making Cairns and Towns-
ville their first ports of call. Did these
migrants remain in the north or are they
included among those who have decided
to try their luck south of the border?
All other States gained by migration
during the period, but only New South
Wales and Westralia showed better
figures than in the previous year. Even
so, N.S.W. still attracted fewer migrants
than Victoria. Totals: N.5.W.., 24,028;
Vic., 27,284; S.A., 9391; W.A., 3126;
Tas., 1829.

“Just a song at twilight. ...”
Victorian Premier Bolte’s entourage
for his world tour, starting on April 24,
is swelling. Alec Coutnard, in charge
of the State Development division of
the Premier’s Department, will go to
America ahead of the rest of the party
and stay there for some weeks after it
has left on its “Sell Victoria” mission.
Geoffrey Smith, also of the Premier’s
Department, an experienced greeter and
protocol man, will accompany Bolte, as
will Sir John Jungwirth, permanent head
of the Premier’s Department, and Cr.
Maurice Nathan, chairman of the Vic-
toria Promotion Committee.
Suggestions that we ought to be
“selling” Australia and not merely parts
of it don’t seem to have had very much
effect in discouraging these individual
State missions. Bolte developed a taste
for them in his first term of office, and,
while his domestic political situation
remains pretty comfortable, he’s going
abroad for a long second stretch. He
would say, of course, that in “selling”
Victoria he is also ’’selling” Australia.

A Cabinet crisis in Holland a week
before Christmas caused by the resigna-
tion from the Coalition Government of
four Labor Ministers was resolved by
the formation of a caretaker Govern-
ment with Professor L. T. M. Beel as
Prime Minister and with five Catholic
and four Protestant-party Ministers. A
general election will be held on March 12.
After the 1956 election the division of
seats was: Labor, 50; Catholic People’s
party, 49 ; two Protestant Christian
parties, 28 ; Liberals, 13 ; Communists,
7 ; Political Reformed party, 3. The
first four parties formed the coalition
which ruled Holland for nearly 10 years.

It looks as though non-native residents
of New Guinea will be paying income-
tax before long. A report prepared by
the Department of Territories suggests a
personal rate equal to 60 per cent, of
the Australian rate and a company-rate
of 4s. in the £ (Australian rate 7s. 6d.).
The report says that these rates, plus
import- and export-duties already pay-
able, would still give the New Guinea tax-
payer a 25 per cent, advantage over the
Australian. Nothing official yet, but the
folk in Port Moresby are said to be pre-
pared for the worst. It just goes to show
that there’s no profit in being a fron-
tiersman any longer. Civilisation catches
up with you too fast.

Australian trade-mission ship Delos
reached Brisbane last week after a 10-

orders were booked for Australian goods
valued at £2 million. R. S. Colquhoun,

Mr. Colquhoun said he felt the long-term

“Siosal” farewells an old colleague:
The passing, at 85, of William Peter Hurst,
former editor of Melbourne “Australasian”
and “Argus,” shows that editors sometimes
emulate old soldiers. . Only last year, Sir
Edward Cunningham, one of Hurst’s predeces-
sors in the “Argus” chair, registered 98 at the
end.
Judging superficially, anyone who knew Peter
Hurst up to 25 years ago would have bet
against that 85, partly because of his airy
technique in car-driving, but mainly because of
his gaunt frame and features. To counter this,
he had the ability, priceless in an editor, to
relax and could go to sleep at any given
moment but wake at any time he chose to set.
A calm mind controlled all Hurst’s activi-
ties. Puffing placidly at his pipe, he met all
editorial “situations” philosophically, and when
producing articles (always hand-written) he
merely kept going without any suggestion of
haste, delivering in his own good time wares
that were essentially sound.
In his earlier days he was concerned with
politics, and he kept that interest until his
retirement 20 years ago. But his long-suit was
book-reviewing; well-informed in established
material, he always gave a hearty greeting to
any worthy new work. His own single produc-
tion between covers was an “Argus” style-
book, a sage collection of must-nots that
scared the daylights out of junior reporters.
On one memorable occasion Hurst’s respect
for the language- —plus his blithe ignorance of
sport—led him into a choice “blue.” Finding
in his editorial proofs a large heading, “Nelly
Thrice Wins at Flemington,” Peter promptly
amended this to read, “Nelly Wins Three Times
at Flemington.” How was he, a staid editorial
bookworm, to know that the horse was not
named Nelly but, in fact, Nelly Thrice?

ABORIGINALITIES
T ocal water-restrictions bring to mind
a notice pasted on the wall of one
of the bathrooms at Baroona, an old
Dangar property near Singleton (N.S.W.).
It read: —-
REMEMBER dear friends, brave men and
fair women,
This bath is for washing, but not meant to
swim in ;
While you’re heartily welcome its pleasures to
taste,
We mildly suggest that ’tis wicked to waste
That Heaven-sent fluid, whose constant* supply
Depends on our brilliant but changeable sky:
And, those who waste water may empty the
tank,
A disaster sedree equalled by a run on the
bank!
1875 E.M.B.
The initials stand for the late Mrs.
Hunter Brett, whose husband was A. A.
Dangar’s agent in Newcastle. “A.A.”
took-over Baroona in 1869, the property
passing later on to his son, the late R. R.
Dangar.
Two other items of interest in the old
homestead were a clock, by George
Graham, of London, with hand - cut
wooden gear-wheels, reputed to be some
200 years old, and a bookcase of oak
from H.M.S. Foudroyant, Nelson's flag-
ship, in which “A.A.” served as a mid-
shipman. If memory serves, the bookcase
housed bound volumes of “Illustrated
London News” and the “Sphere” from
their inceptions.
But today, if you ask Alec Young,
who managed the property for many
years for “R.R.D.,” what was Baroona
famous for, he will reply that it was
there that Peter Pan was foaled and
f aised.
ADVOCATE.
“Lagen”: A New Australian, trying to
develop a farm in the backblocks, adver-
tised for a wife. The only reply—from a
bush-girl stated that “father had
promised her a tractor for a wedding-
gift.” The prospective ’groom imme-
diately sent-off a telegram, “Please send
photo of tractor.”

“Bass”: At a Perth exhibition a large
goanna made a meal of a smaller go.
with which it was sharing a cage, and
according to a daily it was a case of a
tree-goanna eating a racehorse-goanna.
There are several species of monitor-
lizard — genus Varanus —in W.A., and
all those in the south-west are called
racehorse-goannas. They all climb trees,
so you wouldn’t be far wrong in calling
them all tree-goannas ; and although
each species has certain distinguishing
features by which it can be -classified
without much trouble by the semi-
expert, they’re sufficiently alike to con-
fuse the complete layman. I wouldn’t
claim to understand which species was*
meant by “tree”-goanna, and I’ll bet the
reporter didn’t either. A simpler way
would be to label them all “racehorse,”
with an adjective derived from their
specific names, e.g., Gould's racehorse-
goanna, and so forth.

“Quarter-cut”: S.S. Queen Mary was
built contemporaneously with Waterloo
Bridge being rebuilt, and the old elm-
piles extracted from the bridge were Well
preserved, with their wood of an unusual,
“If that Was a no-ball, umpire, it must've been a ruddy brick!"
bright curry-color. It was veneer-sliced
for panelling two Queen Mary drawing-
saloons, and pontifications were pub-
lished that the color was caused by some
magical properties of Thames water
acting for a couple of centuries on the
wood. We were not impressed, because
some years previously the elm rolling-
chocks on S.S. Nairana had to be re-
placed with redgum at Melbourne, and
that bright-yellow elmwood was snapped-
up by cabinetmakers. Not believing in
any magical properties of either the
Tassie Tamar or the Vic. Yarra, we
deduced that the color had resulted
simply from elmwood being soaked for
a year or so in sea-water.

“Salmon Gums": That bloke who put
tortoises in his fishpond (B. 12/11/’5B)
deserved to have tortoises in his fish-
pond. Don’t know exactly what those
reptiles live on, but I fancy they’re not
choosy, and they’re equipped to handle
anything that moves underwater. They
can stay under for hours at a time, they
can walk along the bottom apparently
unhindered by buoyancy, their camou-
flage is perfect in those surroundings, and
that long neck can snake out quite fast
enough to take a goldfish. I’ve seen
swamp - birds, foraging head - down
through some water-weed, suddenly begin
to struggle and go down fighting, and
I’ve felt pretty certain they'd gone to
provide a meal for a tortoise.

Ever since the Olympic Games I’ve
been trying to think what those five
interlocking circles remind me of, and
at last l remember. In the outback, in
the early 'twenties, the only kind of road-
grader known was the horse-drawn fire-
plough. This made a track just wide
enough for a car. Anyone wanting to
grade a wider strip, such as a bush race-
track or a landing-strip for aircraft,
fastened together several of the heavy




iron tyres off wagon- or dray-wheels and
dragged them over the area. Five tyres
were often fixed in the Olympic pattern,
though of course not overlapping ; some-
times a sixth was fastened in front of the
top two to form a sort of triangle. Like
so many bush makeshifts, it was rough
but effective. —“Margaret.”

“M’Lou”: A Wonwondah East (Vic.)

trap.

many of those Afghan hawkers (B.
26 /11 / ’5B) were born beyond the Khyber
Pass. Every Asiatic who ran a string
of camels in Australia was classed as a
’Ghan, but those I met were almost
without exception natives of what is now
Pakistan. One who landed at Fremantle
without a bean —he deserted a ship whose
conditions had prompted some of his
shipmates to suicide —was soon carting
“Got your parents' consent?"
prospectors’ gear to the goldfields and
engaging in general trading. He started
a business in Perth, brought his father
and some other relatives out, built shops
and a hostel in Perth and established a
bank in Karachi. When his Perth estates
were sold after his death they realised
the best part of a quarter of a million.

“Myall”: The Defence Standards
Laboratory in Melbourne is making
research on the stinging-tree, looking for
an antidote to its sting. Of the three
varieties, all natives of Queensland —the
giant (Laportea gigas), quite a large tree;
the shining-leaf {L. photiniphylla),
medium - sized; and Gympie (L.
moroides), a shrub —the last-named is the
worst stinger. Sometimes the sting effect
will last for months. The leaves of each
•kind contain minute hairs, with here and
there larger ones. These latter are hollow,
brittle tubes filled with strong acid —
that’s what rocks you. Juice of the
cunjevoi will give relief, but this plant
isn’t always handy.

“Macquarie”: A truckdriver can’t be
forced to carry bags of cement, although
he does have to stand on his vehicle and
hand the bags down to the unloaders ;
so it was entirely to help our two rather
weary builders’ laborers that Languid
backed right inside the shed. The load
off, he attempted to drive out, but with
the weight off the springs the truck was
too high to pass under the lintel. Belli-
gerently he offered the laborers three
choices: (1) stack the load on again and
carry it back inside after he’d got his
vermilion truck out; (2) chop out two
ditches in the concrete floor ; (3) knock
out the lintel. The second and third
weren’t practical, and No. 1 too horrify-
ing to contemplate. But it shocked
Languid into unaccustomed thought. He
deflated the tyres. Our anticipation of
two work-shies sweating over a hand-
pump was not realised. Languid and his
mate took the wheels off, chucked ’em in
L.'s old bomb, and ran them up to the
garage and free air.

“Yen”: Half-a-mile from Koonalda
station, on the Nullarbor in Centralia,
there’s a blowhole with an opening of not
more than 12in. It could be heard roar-
ing some distance away, and our hats
were blown off as soon as we leant over
it. Some days later we went again to
get a photo of a flag being blown ver-
tically. But there was no sound, and the
flag was sucked down into the hole.
Another blowhole five miles away was
blowing out strongly. Guess is that these
varying air-currents come from a vast
interconnected cave-system.

“Terry”: Amongst four of them —a
pair of canaries and two male finches —
Father Canary always insisted on the
first bath, the choicest dandelion-head and
the privilege of scattering the seed with
a vainglorious raking flourish. The day
two female finches arrived he reached
the peak of his career by giving Mother
Canary a thorough hiding. Had she
dared to hint he would have difficulty
keeping up with the Joneses, or was he
just showing his fellow-males how to stay
cock of the domestic walk?

“Thew”: Old Harry, who reckons he
got through a lifetime’s hard yakka in
his goldmining days, has no wood-
chopping chores at his shack on the river-
bank. His system is to hook logs out of
the flooded river and, when dry, push ’em
a little further through the doorway as
the flames burn away the end in the
fireplace.

Claypan reprieve from trig.-site slate

Time Means Tucker
By H. P. ("DUKE”) TRITTON
Illustrations chiefly from contemporary issues of The Bulletin,
Both of them 19-year-olds, the writer and his mate Dutchy have set out from
Sydney in 1905 on a breezily adventurous wander about the N.S.W. outback,
learning to become shearers, doing fencing contracts and having a go at gold-
digging, singing and taking the hat round in the towns, boxing in show booths,
meeting picturesque characters, and generally getting to know the bush and bush
folk, and taking life as they find it. They have gone by boat to Newcastle, headed
west from there, jumped the rattler to Narrabri, and, characteristically, have
done their share with other volunteer firefighters in saving that town from being
burnt down. Having learnt the shearer’s art at Charlton, they have tramped west
through flood-rains, done a tough fencing-contract, travelled round the country
with George Ruenalf’s boxing-show, tried a hand at rabbit-poisoning, and have
now arrived at Mudgee and the old Gulgong goldfields.
Cullenbone, part of the
Gulgong field, still had
a lot of diggers working.
Most of them were the
men who stayed behind after
the rich leads had been worked-
out. A few were on good gold,
though many were just fossick-
ing in the old workings. Some
were living on the gold they
had won in the peak of the
rushes. It was not unusual to
see one of the old chaps, when
at the pub, pull out a little
leather bag and take out a
pinch of fine gold to pay for
his shout. They were very
secretive about it when sober,
but would flash their pokes
when the grog was taking
effect.
A year before, one of the
old diggers, Jack Spence,
living alone at Rats’ Castle,
had been robbed and murdered.
Several men had been arrested,
and discharged for lack of
evidence, and it is still an un-
solved crime.
The pub was kept by a
jovial old chap, Sid Norris,
who in his young days had
been a blade-shearer. He was
an easy touch for any hard-
luck story, but he said he
seldom failed to get repaid in
full. Every night there was a
good crowd in the pub. Cards,
mostly euchre or crib, were
always on. Sometimes we
would have a sing-song, with
all hands joining in to the best
of their ability.
Often there would be a few
teams camped for the night.
The bullock-teams always
fascinated me, and their drivers
seemed to be remarkable men.
Ned Inglis, a little old man
whose face was hidden behind
a mass of whiskers, told of
taking wool from Tondeburin
to Circular Quay before the
railway was built. His father
had two teams, and Ned was
driving one at 15 years of age.
He was close to 70, and still
driving bullocks. On the
return-trip the wagons brought
supplies for the diggers at
Sofala, and also brought
diggers and their outfits. Swags,
etc., were carried on the
wagons, while the men walked.
Ned reckoned there was an
unbroken line of teams from
Penrith to Bathurst. The trip
took nine days, which is extra-
good for bullocks.
TTsually, the bullockies wore
whatever they happened
to have in the line of clothes,
but travelling with Ned was a
young man, Tommy Newman.
He was about 25, tall, well-
built and good-looking. He
wore Wellington-boots, white
corduroy trousers, carpet-
snakeskin belt, red shirt and
wide-brimmed Panama hat,
and everything was spotlessly
clean.
Sid Norris had three good-
looking daughters, and Tommy
was interested in one of them.
But he spoilt his appeal by
posing and strutting too much,
and the girls jeered at him quite
openly. It didn’t discourage
Tommy in the least. He took
all insults with a cheerful grin
and came back for more.
Ned and Tommy camped at
Belinfante bridge for nearly a
week, to give their bullocks a
spell on good feed before
tackling the 170-mile trip to
Baradine, their home-town.
We went down for a yarn
every night, and the time never
dragged.
Dutchy, who had ideas of
getting rich quick, thought he
could make a heavyweight
champion out of Tommy, but
when he offered to take him in
hand and make a fighting man
of him Tommy refused point-
blank.
“No bloomin’ fear,” he said.
“I know I’m a good-lookin’
bloke, and I wouldn’t like to
get my face knocked about, like
some of those pugs with flat
noses and squashed ears that
I’ve seen. No blanky fear!”
No amount of persuasion
could make him alter his mind.
I don’t think he was lacking in
courage, but he was so
wrapped-up in his good looks
that it would have broken his
heart to lose them. And it may
have been just plain common-
sense, for the hardest way to
make a living that I knew of
then was boxing. In spite of
his flashness, he was a nice
bloke, and Ned Inglis was a
great old chap.
ChD Norris had lent us all
the gear we needed, and
we were getting enough gold
to keep us going. The lead
was hard to follow one of
those runs of gold that go
along for a few feet, then cut-
out completely, with no indi-
cation of where they make
again. We would be on the
point of giving it up when
we’d strike another nice patch.
Sometimes it would be heavy
gold, and then light, flaky stuff.
We didn’t care how fine it was,
so long as it kept going so that
we could follow it.
The old diggers had a say-
ing, “Where there’s nits, there’s
lice.” And it proved to be
right, for we struck several
slugs, from two ’weights up to
12, and a nugget of one ounce,
ten ’weights. But a few days
later we ran into old ground—
that is, ground that had been
worked-over previously, so we
gave it away.
This lead was known as
Terrace Gully, if you were
speaking to women, priests,
parsons or little children. The
diggers called it another name
that sounded something like
Terrace, but was not spelt the
same way.
returned the equipment
- * we had borrowed from
Sid, and went back to get our
swags. We intended to stay
at the pub, and see what a
bed felt like after sleeping on
gumleaves for so long.
As we came over the bridge
we saw a ram acting in an
odd manner. He was on
top of a mullock-heap, and
walking round and round and
occasionally scratching the dirt
with his forefeet. (Dutchy
swore afterwards that he was
trying to fill-in the hole.)
We knew this ram. He
belonged to a family who lived
a short distance from the
bridge. They were a very nice
family, but the ram was not a
nice ram, either in looks or
disposition. He had no pre-
tensions as to breeding, and
would have been a cobbler in
any shed. Why he still
remained a ram was a question
never satisfactorily answered.
Our curiosity was stirred, so
we strolled over to see what had
him so interested. So intent
was he that we approached

New Terms of Trade
VjyHiLE the sale of Aus-
* * tralian produce to Britain,
where covered by firm
contracts (as in the case of
meat, sugar, wheat, etc.), seems
unlikely to be, affected by
recent currency moves. in
Europe, the greater con-
vertibility of sterling and other
European currencies into
dollars will mean that foreign
countries selling for sterling
are now likely to buy in the
dollar area where dollar goods
happen to be cheaper or better
than sterling goods.
Hitherto the inconvertibility
of sterling has anchored buying
to the sterling area where
there has been selling to it by
foreign countries.
Now sterling in the hands
of foreign countries will be
freely convertible into dollars,
though sterling in the hands of
Commonwealth citizens will
not be freely convertible.
Though the- full picture is
by no means clear as
yet, currency developments in
Europe, including the devalu-
ation of the French franc,
seem to have made an un-
favorable change in the terms
of trade for Australia outside
the sterling area so far as both
exports and imports are con-
cerned.
This change has occurred at
the beginning of a calendar-
year in which the overseas
trading outlook was already
glum, though brightened a
little by prices being obtained
for meat and sugar. The
governing factor remains the
price of wool, which seems
likely to be further adversely
affected, temporarily, by the
devalued franc.
The Common Market plan
in Europe got tentatively under
way on January 1. Under this
scheme tariffs between the six
countries are being progress-
ively reduced, and import-
quotas increased; w'hile
external tariffs are being
brought to a common level by
being averaged. Other
countries interested but out-
side the Common Market are
the remaining 11 members of
the organisation for European
Economic Co-operation, in-
cluding Britain. Britain has
proposed a Free Trade area
with progressive reduction of
tariffs among all 17 countries,
but with external tariffs to be
left to each country’s discre-
tion (within the latitude per-
mittee! by GATT), and agri-
cultural products to be omitted
from the terms of the Common
Market.
Principally because of the
opposition of France, Britain’s
proposal has been rejected.
But, from Britain’s stand on the
matter, it has been made clear
that the U.K. is not abandoning
Empire preference, which
would be the obvious result of
any entry into the European
Common Market on the terms
imposed by France. This at
least is reassuring so far as the
Australian market in the
United Kingdom is concerned.
Equitable Probate Takeover
TAirectors of the Equitable
Probate and General In-
surance Co., Ltd., with its
headquarters in Queensland,
have recommended that share-
holders accept the offer of
Queensland Insurance to buy
the co.’s fully-paid 10s. shares
at 38s. 6d. each and the Bs.-
paid shares at 365. 6d.
There has been something
in the nature of an auction
between the Royal - Globe
group (U.K.) and the Queens-
land for some weeks past, and
at one stage the Equitable
board recommended the
Royal - Globe offer. The
Queensland has already bought
more than 20 p.c. of the Equit-
able’s shares, and its latest bid
for the remainder is higher
than the Royal-Globe offer
and has accordingly received
the blessing of the Equitable
board.
The Equitable and Probate
had its beginnings ’in 1922, in
which year both the Equitable
Life Assurance Co., Ltd., and
Queensland Probate Insurance
Co., Ltd., were registered ( in
Brisbane. Both concerns
struggled along under the dis-
abilities attached to most life-
assurance flotations of the
1920’5, and in the later years
of the depression they merged,
the present title being adopted
in 1934.
The merger and the efforts,
including a clean-up of the
“This is a stick-up !”
capital account in 1948, which
followed it brought good
results, and at September. 30,
1958, the co. had a capital of
£111,317 and assurance and
other funds of £4,085,305.
Policyholders have been receiv-
ing bonuses and shareholders
have been getting a 10 p.c.
dividend.
Queensland Insurance will be
acquiring, for about £450,000,
a life-office which had a net
premium income of just under
£BOO,OOO last year, plus a
small general department. The
life department has been
showing actuarial surpluses
sufficient to provide reversion-
ary bonuses, pay dividends and
at the same time allow an
overall greater sum to be set
aside to strengthen subsequent
actuarial valuations.
The net interest return on
the investment of the life fund
last year was £5 11s. 4d. per
cent., compared with £5 ss. 6d.
per cent, in the preceding year.
Takeover of the Equitable
Probate represents part of a
general pattern of expansion
and integration of insurance
and assurance activities in
Australia, represented in part
by the setting-up of life depart-
ments in this country by U.K.
offices formerly only writing
fire-and-accident business or
not .represented here at all.
Another feature of the de-
velopment has been that of
Australian life-offices entering
the fire-and-accident field, and
of h.-p. concerns spreading
into both insurance and assur-
ance.

would induce holders of B.A.
shares to retain them against
the strong bids from Reynolds.
On December 31 a group of
14 institutions in the City
of London, headed by Lazard
Bros, and Hambros Bank, had
offered 82s. a B.A. share for
half of any shareholder’s
stock, on condition that the
other half was not sold for
up to three months. This
effort aimed at keeping
control of the B.A. empire
within the U.K. Coupled
with the pledged support of
holders of two-million of
B.A.’s nine-million shares, this
was estimated to put 60 p.c.
of B.A.’s scrip out of reach
of Reynolds-T.I. But it was
immediately followed by Rey-
nolds-T.I. bidding up to
85s. on the open market. And
then the Church of England,
holder of 260,000 shares in
8.A., was last week reported
to have sold its holding at
85s. a share. “Ah, take the
cash in hand and waive the
rest! ”
As explained in B. 7/1 / ’59,
B.A. had on November 14 last
agreed to sell 4,500,000 shares
to the Aluminium Corporation
of America (Alcoa) at 60s. a
share, with 12 out of 15 seats
on the board to remain with
B.A. directors.
The original offer by Rey-
nolds-T.I. was one T.I. share
(now at about 82s. on London
’Change) and 78s. cash for
every two B.A. shares. These
B.A. shares would be vested in
a co. owned 51 p.c. by T.I.
and 49 p.c. by Reynolds.
Following the counter-
offer by the City group the
Reynolds-T.I. group began
buying direct on the Stock
Exchange. This involved no
immediate new issue of shares
by T.I. or any subsidiary, and
no Treasury consent is required
for the operation.
But the original offers both
by Alcoa and Reynolds-T.I.
would have involved the getting
of Treasury consent to new
issues (by B.A. itself in the
case of Alcoa, and by the
Reynolds-T.I. offshoot on the
other case).
There has been an intense
political interest in the U.K.
over the attempt by the U.S.
Reynolds group to obtain
control of the expanding B.A.
enterprise, which now spreads
to Canada, Australia (Weipa)
and Africa, and should soon be
showing results in the p.-and-l.
account of its past organisa-
tion and enterprise.
While B.A. directors wel-
comed a safeguarding associ-
ation with Alcoa on the terms
arranged by themselves, they
regard the move by Reynolds
as “an attempt to acquire a
powerful empire for the price
of a small kindgdom.”
So long as ploughed-back
profits are used on an exten-
sive scale by any expanding
company to finance big
development there will always
be a danger of takeovers at
bargain prices by other big,
wide-awake organisations.

defeat. Blainey brings this out
strongly in the course of
developing the argument that
the National board and
management, in the ’twenties
and ’thirties, remained excess-
ively influenced by bitter
memories of 1893, when it had
to suspend payment for eight
weeks.
Blainey incorporates in his
history a history also of the
Queensland National Bank,
“united” with the National
from 1948 after negotiations
carried-out on the neutral soil
of Sydney in 1946, and that
remained an astonishingly well-
kept secret for nine months.

World Trade
'T'he United States is looking
for a big increase in auto-
mobile sales during 1959, and
if expectations are justified this
should mean an improvement
in the demand for metals and a
revival of general industrial
activity in the U.S.A.
International authorities are
looking to a continued growth
in world trade and domestic
trade during the next few years,
their expectations being based
on a greater degree of stability
in economic factors—including,
apparently, prices and costs —
which, if achieved, should help
to make production figures and
living-standards real instead of
inflationary mirages.
The World Bank aims to
double its capital during 1959
and to borrow and lend oil a
commensurately greater scale.
Borrowing will be from the
highly developed countries and
lending to the underdeveloped.
But any help given by the
World Bank and the Inter-
national Monetary Fund will
be based to a large extent on
the manner in which the
country requiring help is
shaping in meeting its own
problems.
Economic stability and
industrial efficiency, including
the efficiency of manpower,
will be creditworthy national
assets in the international
scheme of economic help
during the coming critical year.
More and more emphasis is
being placed on stability .in the
leading Western countries,
especially the United States and
Britain. In the interests of
greater stability it seems certain
that the United States Govern-
ment withheld credit and other
economic help from its
depressed industries during the
past year in order to hit infla-
tion the hardest possible blow.
Only recently, too, has the
United Kingdom tended to
relax its financial efforts aimed
sternly against inflation.
The West has by no means
knocked-out inflation. But it
has given it a hard crack, and
it has at least removed the
idea from world markets that
inflation will go on from
boom to boom regardless.
So far as Australia is con-
cerned, its reliance on primary
products as its chief exports
and main source of overseas
income will tend to make it
one of the worst sufferers, in
terms of external trade, of the
deflation that has occurred in
world open-market prices for
wool, metals, and other raw
materials.
While the returns from our
exports have fallen precipi-
tously, the cost of most manu-
factured goods has either risen
or remained stable.
By most standards, prices for
our raw-material exports at the
present time are very low, and
seem unlikely to continue for
a great deal longer at such un-
profitable levels. Any recovery
in U.S. industry should be
reflected in world raw-material
prices in the long-run. The
immediate future looks fairly
grim, but so long as we take
realistic measures (such as in-
creasing productivity and
reducing costs) to cope with
our economic deficiencies Aus-
tralia should re-enter a period
of more stable and profitable
conditions within the next year
or 18 months.


Oil Retrospect for 1958
By L. OWEN
Australia
Wells Not Completed in
1957
"POLLOWING on an unbroken
run of disappointing wells
sunk in the search for petro-
leum, during 1957, on the Aus-
tralian mainland, the New
Year opened torpidly with only
two major rigs in action.
A well at Learmonth, W.A.,
drilling with a modified T-32
outfit, was at 6155 ft. By the
end of January it had reached
7636 ft. without encountering
any significant shows of oil
or gas. Although this well
was sited a little westward from
Rough Range 1, the location,
in my opinion, was far too
little west and far too much
north to allow of any hope of
encountering conditions which
would lead to a measurable
accumulation of oil at the
Birdrong horizon. The failure
of the Learmonth bore did
not, therefore, surprise me.
The second major well was
at Dural, in the Sydney Basin.
Dural 2 was located west of
Dural 1, following on the
abandonment of the latter in
igneous rock, and was at
2740 ft. at the turn of the year.
As might be expected in any
well approaching or penetrat-
ing coal-measures, some gas
was struck, but the shows were
of no commercial significance.
Dural 2 was abandoned at the
end of July, 1958, at 6465 ft.,
the immediate cause, unfortu-
nately, being sabotage.
Two shallow test-bores were
drilling above coal - measures
near Camden, N.S.W.; both
struck shows of gas, but were
abandoned on completion.
Other wells drilling for oil
at the start of 1958 were
located near Longreach and
Roma in Queensland and in
the Carpentaria Basin, but all
were completed without dis-
covering anything of value.
Wells Spudded-in During
1958-
In Western Australia the
failure of any wells to strike
flow-oil—particularly at the
Birdrong horizon, on which
the search had been concent-
rated —was followed by an
announcement that the operat-
ing company intended to give
priority to the north-west part
of the State and that active
operations would be trans-
ferred from Exmouth Gulf to
the Kimberleys. Later it was
emphasised that this move did
not mean the abandonment of
the Carnarvon Basin as a pros-
pective oilfield.
In pursuance of the policy
outlined, a well was located at
Samphire and was spudded-in
on February 18. It was fore-
cast that the bore might be
carried down to a depth of
8000 ft. During drilling, it was
claimed that the interpretation
of seismic data had accurately
given the depths of formation
tops down to 3000 ft. “Base-
ment,” consisting of hard
granite, was entered, however,
at the unanticipated “high”
of 6610 ft., and the well was
abandoned on March 3 at
6669 ft. without producing any
show of oil or gas.
The rig was then moved
some 300 miles to a location at
Meda, about 40 miles east of
Derby, and Meda 1 well was
spudded-in on June 8. It
reached basement at 8808 ft. on
October 7. Shows of gas and
oil were observed, but, on test,'
were found to be of no com-
mercial value, although several
gallons of crude oil were col-
lected from the top of a
settling-tank after the 5110/
5133 ft. interval had been
treated with acid. After test-
ing, the well was abandoned
at 8809 ft. on November 25.
A location at Goldwyer, 30
miles s.-s.-e. of Broome, was
spudded-in on August 17, using
a T-32 rig, and was expected to
drill to 6000-7000 ft., according
to geophysical forecasts. Base-
ment-rocks, however, were
encountered at 4574 ft., and the
well was abandoned on
October 21 at 4638 ft. Show-
ings of oil were first observed
at 2900 ft. and persisted to
about 4000 ft. in a tight lime-
stone. Four formation-tests,
over various intervals in this
zone, failed to recover any oil
or gas.
Other wells sunk in the
search for oil during the year
were at Longreach (abandoned
at 1367 ft.), Karumba (Gulf of
Carpentaria, abandoned in
quartzite at 2364 ft.) and
Woomera (S.A.).
Wells sunk primarily for gas
were Mulgoa (N.S.W.),
spudded-in in September and
about 2000 ft. in depth at the
end of the year, and four
shallow bores at Camden (Nos.
3, 4 5 and 6). All the shallow
bores struck uncommercial
shows of gas and were com-
pleted, except No. 6, which was
drilling at the end of the year.
Other wells currently drilling
for gas are located near Mait-
land and Grafton.
Papua
Wells Not Completed in
1957
At the beginning of the year
three major wells were drilling
in the Delta District of Papua.
They were all located on a line
running just below lat. 7°S.
and extending from long. 143°
E. to long. 145°E. Komewu 2
was at 5590 ft. at the turn of the
year and entered basement-
rocks at 9950 ft. It was aban-
doned early in April at 9977 ft.
without encountering any signi-
ficant shows of oil or gas.
Barikewa well was 8025 ft. on
January 1. It struck what were
described as “moderate to sub-
stantial shows” of gas above
8000 ft. Drilling was stopped
“in arkoses and conglomerates
believed to be terrestrial in
origin” at 13,682 ft. in July. It
did not reach basement.
Puri well started the year at
2210 ft., and drilling was sus-
pended at 10,100 ft. “in a thick
mudstone series of no oil-
potential interest.” At the end
of October the well produced
gas at the rate of three-
million cu. ft. per day, together
with 70 barrels of condensate
from the 7460-7508 ft. zone.
This gas was very definitely
“wet,” as it carried very nearly
one U.S. gallon of liquefiable
petroleum gases (L.P.G.) per
1000 cu. ft., according to the
figures given. Probably, if full
allowance were made for the
butane content, the L.P.G.
content would be much higher.
On acidising, the well flowed a
mixture of condensate and
light crude oil at a rate slightly
in excess of 1000 barrels a day.
A prolonged flow-test
brought in water, with a reduc-
tion in the oil-production, and
the test figures were interpreted
as indicating that, “on contin-
uous production, this particular
hole would produce com-
paratively small quantities of
oil.” Since November no
decision has been made public
as to the fate of the Puri well,
but it is understood that use
will be made of the existing
location and rig for directional
drilling with the object of
proving the 7500 ft. zone
laterally.
Wells Spudded-in During
1958
Kuru 3 was spudded-in on
April 30. At 1846 ft., soft
formations caused drilling
difficulties, but these were over-
come and drilling then con-
tinued without serious inter-
ruption to 8843 ft., where
progress was held-up by the
entry of high-pressure gas and
water into the hole. Drilling
was suspended in late
November.
The only other well drilling
in Papua during 1958 was at
Kaufana, in the Central
District. This well was at
2935 ft. at the beginning of the
year and was located in an area
regarded unfavorably owing to
results obtained by previous
wells sunk in the district in
1938 and 1949. The Kaufana
bore was drilled with a second-
hand T-32 rig and was
abandoned, early in 1958, at
3380 ft. without revealing any-
thing of value.
Portuguese Timor
Apart from slim-hole scout-
bores, the only well drilled in
Timor during 1958 was one
sunk in the Aliambata seepage
area. This well had attained
the depth of 3833 ft. at the
beginning of the year. Artesian
water interrupted operations at
4165 ft. in February, and the
well was plugged in April. A
detailed geological examination
is now being carried out before
further major drilling is under-
taken.
General
In Western Australia the
move, early in the year, from
the Carnarvon Basin—even
though assurances were given
that the withdrawal was to be
temporary—was discouraging,
particularly in view of the fact
that in my opinion the deeper
strata hold possibilities not yet
fully explored. The removal
of the National 130 rig from
Learmonth to South Australia
at the end of the year did little
to brighten the outlook.
In Papua the threatened
withdrawal in February of the
major partners from participa-
tion in operations in Western
Papua caused despondency
which was not eased until the
announcement, early in
November—made after oil
had been struck in the Puri
well —that they would con-
tinue.
On the mainland, outside
Western Australia, a report in
March—made more serious by
its factual nature announc-
ing that Interstate Oil was
severely curtailing its opera-
tions intensified the gloom.
At the end of April, how-
ever, it was stated that well-
known U.S. oil-organisations

SUNDRY
SHOWS
TALKIES
THEATRE
MUSIC
ART
SYDNEY STAGE, 1958
There was not a lot of out-
standing theatre over the last
12 months in Sydney, although
a few highlights more-or-less
rewarded the regulars for what
they experienced in between.
Doris Fitton’s Independent, at
North Sydney, could probably
claim the most consistent
standard, coming up with four
topnotch productions of
interesting plays with three
more interesting performances
scattered through them.
Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting
for Godot” was the most
interesting and impressive item
put-on during the year by any
theatre, with Peter O’Shaugh-
nessy (who also directed the
production) and Barry
Humphries giving highly note-
worthy performances as the
two deadbeats waiting on the
fringe of nowhere for nothing
in particular. Another Inde-
pendent production, “Under
Milk Wood,” was also beauti-
fully produced and acted,
while Tennessee Williams's
“Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” was
given a very forceful work-
out by the same theatre, with
Kevin Brennan excelling him-
self as Big Daddy.
The fourth outstanding In-
dependent effort —and the only
major Shakspearian production
for the year —was John Alden’s
“Titus Andronicus,” given a
good, rich and straightforward
interpretation, which was also
a reminder that Sydney doesn’t
see as much of Mr. Alden’s
work as it should. The other
main Independent productions
were “Member of the Wed-
ding,” “Murder Story” and
“The Matchmaker” —all well
done and all worth seeing.
Sydney Royal devoted the
year to light comedies, of
which “The Great Sebastians”
was probably the best all-round
show, due largely to the
polished efforts of Roger
Livesey and Ursula Jeans —two
smooth-working veterans who
could make a comedy out of
a taxation return. Excellent
performances of “Nude with
Violin,” with Robert Help-
mann, and “Not in the Book,”
with Edwin Styles, were also
delightfully put over by the
principal players. A light light-
“Matilda ! If you MUST play that instrument , please play it sidesaddle !”
weight, “Dear Delinquent,”
filled out the annual bill.
Sydney Empire was given
over largely to magicians and
dancing. The Great Sorcar
confounded the audience with
his miracles, and Franquin did
much the same later in the year
with his particular branch of
the business. “Damn Yankees”
showed up brightly among the
rest of the year’s programmes,
which were mainly dancing,
beginning with the Borovanskys
and Elaine Fifield (in a sensi-
tive “Giselle”), passing on to
Luisillo and his spectacular
Spanish dancers (they showed
up again at the Royal later in
the year), then to the New
York City Ballet —spectacular
and imaginative if not so well
drilled as one would have
wished and finally to the
superb Royal Ballet Company,
in which Svetlana Beriosova
and Rowena Jackson left un-
forgettable impressions. Beri-
osova’s “Swan Lake” and Miss
Jackson’s many brilliant pas de
deux were particular highlights,
as was the dancing of David
Blair and Donald Britton. The
whole company, in fact, was a
perfect entity and rarely seemed
to lack the perfect dancers
for any ballet it presented.
In lighter vein, the Tiv. was
consistently good—as it always
is—with half-a-dozen pro-
grammes, its outstanding im-
portations for the year being
singer Shirley Bassey and,
later, pianist Winifred Atwell.
William Orr’s Phillip-street:
Theatre made one change
during the year, replacing its
long-running “Around the
Loop” with “Bats,” another
cheerful and witty intimate
revue which was good when it
opened and, if Mr. Orr is
running true to form, is
probably even better now.
The Genesians were out in
front among the little theatres,
particularly with “An Italian
Straw Hat” and “The Skin of
Our Teeth,” although notable
work from other groups in-
cluded “The Man,” put on by
the Ensemble Theatre at North
Sydney, and keen competent
work from the Pocket Play-
house and the W.E.A. Attic
Theatre.
The Pocket Playhouse has
plenty of dash and is
apparently willing to have a
go at anything in the book.
It says a good deal for their
spirit and general approach
that most of their offerings for
the year were thoughtfully
produced and acted. Allow-
ing for obvious limitations
common to all striving small
bodies, their presentations
were, at least, presentable.
The W.E.A. Attic Theatre
put on John Bluthal’s produc-
tion of Eliot’s “The Confi-
dential Clerk,” with Frederick
Powell, Alan Tobin, Judyth
Barron and Robert McPhee.
In “High Tor,” by Maxwell
Anderson (fantasy on indi-
vidual freedom v. mass corrup-
tion), producer Keith Smith
took the part of the woodsman
resisting real-estate sharks;
J. C. McFarlane and John
Meaney were among the sup-
porting cast. Lesley Storm’s
“Black Chiffon,” about a
mother whose love of her son
proves stronger than the family
tensions it causes, was pro-
duced by Edward Jackson,
with lima Sutherland, Hugh
Richardson and, again, J. C.
McFarlane.
On the north side of the
Bridge the Imperial Playhouse
presented “Simon and Laura,”
the engaging story of an
“ideal, happily married couple”
whose home is invaded by the
8.8. C., with Keith Goddard,
Betty Parsons and John Elder-
shaw among the main players.
Edwin Chodorov’s frothy sling-
off at psychoanalysis “Oh,
Men! Oh, Women!” starred
Robert Hatherley as the No.
1 patient, with Betty Parsons
in a supporting part. “Meet
Mr. Callaghan,” a Peter Chey-
ney detective-story directed by
Frank Allden, had Jack Lon-
don assured in the main role,
with Betty Parsons, Robert
Moylan, Bill Doughty and
Keith Goddard seeing him
through.

Williams brought Dickens and
Dylan Thomas to life for
crowded houses . rich, pene-
trating performances, these,
full of warmth and sympathy
for the authors and their
characters and revealing much
that many readers had never
realised before.
Last —and only in that posi-
tion because it is in a category
of its own —is the Elizabethan
Theatre. “Time Remembered,”
with Margaret Rutherford
having the time of her life, was
its best offering for the year,
with “Salad Days,” a whim-
sical musical-comedy running
a close second. “Lola Montez,”
very good in .spots and not so
good in others, was its biggest
offering for the year; “The
Shifting Heart” made re-
appearances ; and “Curly on
the Rack,” a New Guinea
melodrama, was probably the
least distinguished play put-on
in Sydney during the year.
The Elizabethan’s future is
of more immediate interest
than its past, however. To-
wards the end of the year
director Hugh Hunt and the
new resident producer Robin
Lovejoy together announced
and explained a new policy
under which the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust is forming a
permanent company of eight
players (the Trust Players)
which will present a season of
five plays this year, with the
emphasis on Australian plays,
including the recently
announced winner of the com-
petition conducted by the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust and
General Motors - Holden's,
Limited. Among other things,
the Trust hopes to build up
a repertoire of “Australian
classics” and to establish a
closer communion between
players, producers and audi-
ences —it aims at creating
“habit audiences” and giving
them a “feeling of possession”
towards the theatre.
All good, as are its proposals
to reduce the vast seating-
space in the theatre at New-
town and make more room for
audience amenities in general.
One of the best things that Mr.
Lovejoy said while elaborating
on the Trust’s plans was that
many more Australian plays
are being written and quite a
number of them are worth
considering. If the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust can develop this
field it will be on the way to
fulfilling what most people
believed was its purpose.
Films
“Inn of the Sixth Happiness”
In Cinema Scope and Tech-
nicolor, this film purports to
tell the factual story of Gladys
Aylward, a young English-
woman whose determination to
do missionary work in China
overrode all objections ' the
authorities could raise on the
score of her lack of academic
and other qualifications. Work-
ing under an aged matron in a
menial capacity, she soon
shows she is a woman of
sterling character.
When the matron is killed in
an accident she takes-over the
outpost hostelry-cwm-mission,
gradually gets the local
M-andarin around to her way
of progressive thinking and,
as his officially-appointed Foot-
Inspector, vigorously polices
the law he promulgates. The
culmination of her work is the
leading of 100 children for
200 miles across forbidding
ranges of mountains to the
safety of a big mission to
escape from the invading
Japanese.
The production has a
genuine ring ; the customs of
the inhabitants are limned m
detail ; the squalor and poverty
of the remote Chinese hinter-
land are starkly drawn; and
events move logically to a
feasible conclusion. In a
lucid and sincere portrait,
Ingrid Bergman, unglamorous
and clad for the most part in
shapeless rags, makes this
dedicated young missionary
live without recourse to any
mock-heroics.
Curt Jurgens is a Eurasian
colonel in the Chinese army
who comes first to admire the
selfless work of the English-
woman and then herself. Both
Miss Bergman and the German
actor lend a simple dignity to
the affair.
In the last screen-role of his
life, the late Robert Donat
gives a relaxed and polished
performance as the old Man-
darin, breaking-down by subtle
means the character from
initial haughtiness and in-
difference to a warm sympathy
with the young missionary’s
aspirations before, in his last
days, he finally embraces
Christianity.

The WILD CAL
COLUMN
Taubmans Industries, Ltd*
After a big jump in output in the
early post-war years, production in
the Australian paint industry caught-up
with demand some five or six years ago,
the subsequent completion of major ex-
pansion - programmes by several large
paint-manufacturers giving the industry
as a whole a plant-capacity in excess of
present-day requirements.
This surplus capacity, coupled with a
slowing-down in the growth of consump-
tion, has led to the intensely competitive
trading conditions which, last term;
caused a slight contraction in the turn-
over, and a more than proportionate fall
in the earnings, of Taubmans Industries,
Ltd., one of the largest producers of
paints, varnishes, synthetic resins, etc.,
in Australia and New Zealand. Although
earnings dropped sharply in the 1956
term the last slip in sales-volume was
in 1951-52.
In common with most of the lead-
ing Australian paint - manufacturers,
Taubmans Industries is controlled
by an English concern, a large
parcel of the co.’s ords. being held by
Pinchin, Johnson and Associates, Ltd.,
of U.K. On a technical level the co. is
also associated with American Marietta
Co. of U.S.A. Parent co. to an organisa-
tion founded in 1901, Taubmans Indus-
tries operates through 15 subsidiaries, the
group having factories in all Australian
States and in Wellington and Auckland
(N.Z.).
Manufacturing-strength has been con-
siderably increased over the last decade,
during which large factories have been
erected in South Australia, Queensland,
Victoria and N.S.W., and “supplemen-
tary” plants in Tasmania, North Queens-
land and Westralia. The Australian
factories now have a combined annual
production - capacity of over 6,500,000
gallons of pigmented finishes, or close to
four times the 1950 figure, while the two
N.Z. plants can turn-out a further
750,000 gallons a year.
Shareholders put-up part of the funds
needed to finance this expansion in 1950,
when a one-for-one issue, at a 20 p.c.
premium, doubled ord. capital, a four-
for-five issue, also at a 20 p.c. premium,
following in the 1956 term. Paid capital
now totals £2,446,071 and includes
£100,000 in 5 p.c. prefs. Steady at 15
p.c. in the five preceding terms, the ord.
div.- Site was cut to 12| p.c. in 1956,
following the fall in earnings, and this
rate of distribution has been maintained
in each of the last two terms.
Competition and rising operating-
expenses, the latter partly offset by the
introduction of new plant and improved
production - techniques, narrowed profit-
margins over the year to September 30
last, and although the group attempted
to counter this trend by concentrating
its sales - effort on the more - profitable
lines, a small (3 p.c.) slip in sales-volume
(value unstated) was accompanied by an
11 p.c. fall in net earnings: —

Arrived at after providing an undis-
closed amount for taxation and £227,261
(down £34,912) for depreciation, the
£368,001 profit was £45,758 below the
previous term’s effort and equal to 15.4
p.c. on ord, capital (after allowing for
the pref. div.), compared with 17.5 p.c.
on average ord. capital in 1957, 17.1 p.c.
in 1956 and 33.2 p.c. in 1955.
The official opening in July, 1958, of
a big industrial-coatings plant at Villa-
wood (Sydney) marked the completion
of the last major item in the group’s
recent expansion programme. However,
financed by share-capital and retained
earnings, the expenditure on fixed assets
over the past few years hasn’t weakened
the liquid position, and, aided by a reduc-
tion in capital-outlay and the contrac-
tion in turnover, working-capital grew
by £54,742 last term to a rather fat
£2,773,880, current assets (£3,807,862)
exceeding all liabilities and provisions by
£2,157,318.
Obviously, the group isn’t scratching
for funds and with £908,105 of share-
premiums tucked-away in the substantial
reserves, the next issue could well be a
bonus-handout, although earnings would
need to pick-up for this to be of imme-
diate benefit to shareholders in terms of
income: —

into full operation, but sharp competition
and a relatively steady market limit

A.P.A. Holdings, Ltd.
HThe all-round progress made by Aus-
tralian Provincial Assurance Associa-
tion, Ltd., last term shows-up in the
accounts through a record amount of
new business, a lower expense-rate and
a higher yield from invested funds. These
gains enabled another lift in the bonus-
rates on life-policies and a bigger pay-
out to shareholders in the parent co.,
A.P.A. Holdings, Ltd.
An interesting addition to the Sydney
’Change list last year, A.P.A. Holdings
was formed in May, 1957, to acquire the
share-capitals of A.P.A. Association and
the infant A.P.A. Fire and General In-
surance Co. The holding co. offered
two £1 ords. and £3 in non-interest-
bearing redeemable loan-stock for each
of the 360,000 £1 ords. in the assurance
co., the share-consideration being based
on shareholders’ funds and the loan-
stock consideration on a £1,408,236 sur-
plus arising from a “fairly estimated”
valuation of freeholds and shareholdings.
No account was taken of the higher
asset-values in the books of the
assurance co.
Paid-capital of A.P.A. Holdings at
September 30 last was £586,558, and at
the same date it held 331,975 ords. in
A.P.A. Association, a number of these
shares having been bought for cash.
Repayments on the loan-stock, which
is inseparable from the scrip, are at
present the chief source of income for
shareholders, a maiden div. of 2} p.c. and
2s. in loan-repayments coming out of
last term’s earnings to make the total
payment worth 12y p.c. on share-capital,
compared with 11-f p.c. in 1956-57. The
loan-repayment left the balance out-
standing equal to 255. 9d. per holding-co.
share, and with the div. appears to have
absorbed all but about 15 p.c. of the divs.
received from the assurance co. The
assurance co. itself distributed all of the
net income from general fund investments
as well as thd net surplus from its
accident department, the life-department
surplus being retained in that depart-
ment's accounts.
Primarily a life-office, Australian Pro-
vincial Assurance began its career in
1912, in Sydney, and now writes life- and
accident-contracts throughout Australia
and New Zealand. The issued capital
of a small subsidiary, A.P.A. Fire and
General Insurance Co., was taken-over
by A.P.A. Holdings on the formation of
that co.
In common with most life-offices, the
A.P.A. has reaped a bumper harvest
of new business over the last decade, and
since 1950 both total assets and the sum
assured under life-policies have doubled.
During the term to September 30 last the
co. wrote a gross £3,492,811 (up £614,324)
of new life-business, of which group term-
assurances accounted for £419,765, lifted
the total sum assured by £2.2 million to
£24.1 million and increased net premium-
income in the accident department by
almost 10 p.c.
Net life-premiums amounted to.
£791,939 (up £50,861), and rents,, interest,
divs., etc., to a net £321,047 (up £26,985)
to give a total income of £1,112,986.
Death claims took 68 p.c. of the sum
expected under the mortality tables
(against 67 p.c. in 1957), and, with
maturities, surrenders, etc., amounted to
£290,508 (up £38,363). Commissions and
management expenses made-off with an
extra £10,615, but represented only 24.8
p.c. of the higher premium income, com-
pared with 25.8 p.c. in the previous term,
depreciation (up £2BO at £9391) and
sundry taxes, etc., bringing total expenses
to £209,233.
After adding £20,000 to an exchange-
contingency reserve, the surplus in the
life-fund was £18,376 stronger at
£186,050, of which £165,699 (up £27,183)
was earmarked for bonuses to policy-
holders, on an increased scale, and the
balance lett to swell the carry-forward to
£71,599. Reserve for new business was
unchanged at £70,000, the life-fund rising
by £613,245 to £6,801,933.
The effective interest-rate on invested
funds advanced by Is. 9d. to £4 19s. p.c.,
further widening the margin between the
3 p.c. earning-rate assumed in the calcu-
lation of policy-liabilities, and the actual
rate. The surplus arising from, this
margin is one of the principal sources of
bonuses to policyholders.
Working for shareholders, the accident
department continued to build-up its
premium income, the £193,440 (up
£17,178) gathered-in last term exceeding
the 1954 figure by 50 p.c. After adding
£6871 to reserve for unexpired risks,
claims ran-out at 45.5 p.c. of the remain-
ing premium income (48.7 p.c. in 1957)
and expenses at 43.8 p.c. (43 p.c.), a
£16,151 surplus (up £237) showing-up
after sending £3700 to a claims-
equalisation reserve. This reserve now
stands at £32,000 and is drawn on when
the loss-rate exceeds 474- p.c.
The net return from accident - and-
general investments was £8142 stronger
at £70,137 and, with the accident sur-
plus, sundry income, etc., gave a net
profit of £89,934, or £10,129 above the
comparable figure for 1957. On its
present shareholding, A.P.A. Holdings’
proportion of the profit would be equal
to 14.5 p.c. on its £586,558 paid-capital.
The progress made by the operating
co. over the past four years can be seen
from the following table, in which the
figures of life and accident departments
are combined: —

In its second complete year of under-
writing, A.P.A. Fire and General also
moved ahead, collecting £7440 of pre-
miums (up £4465) and £3651 (up £404)
of investment-income, out of which it
met £6244 of claims and expenses, in-
creased the reserve for unexpired risks
by £1379 (to 50 p.c. of premiums) and
showed a net profit of £3467 (up £2153).
The co. expects to write a greater amount
of business in the current year and may
soon be making a small contribution to
the parent co.’s income.
In the investment of the assurance co.’s
funds the emphasis remained on Govern-
ment and semi-Government securities
(62.2 p.c. of all assets) which, with shares
and debentures, etc., accounted for 84
p.c. of asset book-values at September
30 last: —

Freeholds are well written-down while,
at balance-date, the market-value of

servative £7,703,675, or £824,366 greater
than the assurance funds. This surplus
is equivalent to 24s. 8d. for each £1 ord.
issued by A.P.A. Holdings up to Sept. 30

an interesting proposition at 48s. 6d. At

r T~'His table, although formally
correct, may be a little
misleading.
It shows as consolidated net
profit for the 1957-58 year
£510,857, which figure has been
struck after deducting £350,200
for taxation (£452,477 in 1956-
57) and £240,135 for deprecia-
tion (£218,919).
Also deducted was £5041 of
pre-acquisition profits, and
sundries such as a £10,259 tax-
overprovision and a £9048
capital - profit have been
excluded from the earnings
figure.
This may seem fiddling, but
for the previous year the basis
of calculation was necessarily
the same —and here pre-acqui-
sition profits for 1956-57
loomed much larger, to a total
of £249,013.
Therefore, if pre-acquisition
profits for the two years in
question are added back into
profit, it seems that the organi-
sation as a whole had a slightly
leaner year, with a total net
profit down from £547,415 to
£515,898.
On the first view, the return
on average ordinary capital
shows an appreciable rise, from
17.1 p.c. to 20 p.c.; on the
second, a steep decline, from
33.6 p.c. to 20.2 p.c. When,
however, a company is expand-
ing as fast as Cyclone, transi-
tional earning-rates should be
treated with a certain reserva-
tion.
Dividends totalling £332,918
(including £39,000 for the
prefs.) are still very well
covered, but, in order to build-
up' a tightish working-capital,
the board cut the rate back to
124- p.c. in place of the 15 p.c.
which had been held since
1953.
This triggered-off the usual
more-than-proportionate share-
market reaction, and the 10s.
ords. fell from a “high” of
around 30s. early in 1958 to
225. 6d. A subsequent reassess-
ment has left the scrip at its
present market-price of 255.,
yield being 5 p.c. and the
chances fair. A decline in
capital available for pastoral
improvements could, however,
further adversely effect
Cyclone’s wire-fencing sales, in
particular, as it seems to have
done so already.
Cyclone is primarily a Vic-
torian show, antedating the
First World War, and consti-
tuted a public company in
1947. The group has about a
score of factories and branches
in all States and produces
chiefly wire- and tubular-steel
products, scaffolding, window-
frames, forged tools, gates and
fences, among a very wide
range.
Notable customers are the
building, pastoral, and, to a
lesser degree, the automotive
industries ; and a steadying-off
in these sections apparently
was reflected in lower receipts
during the term. No turnover
figures, however, accompany
the annual accounts.
New issues to shareholders
have been an interesting feature
of the stock, but those for cash
have lost most of their savor
through the 100 p.c. premium
demanded each time. Between
1952 and 1956 there were three
such one-for-four (1952),
one-for-three (1954), one-for-
four (1956). The 1952 and
1954 issues were preceded by
bonus issues, one-for-four and
ene-for-five respectively.
A sizeable parcel of new
capital has also taken the form
of consideration or part-con-
sideration for new subsidiaries
acquired. The biggest recent
takeover was K-M Steel Pro-
ducts, Ltd., a Melbourne
manufacturer of steel window-
frames and builders’ require-
ments, a deal which cost
Cyclone £1,222,000 in cash,and
£765,000 in scrip. Over the
same period, 1957 and 1958
Wm. C. Lynch Holdings, Ltd.,
a Newcastle light engineer, was
bought-up for about £32,000
in scrip and a small amount in
cash.
Replacing overdraft money
as finance for the cash side of
these transactions was
£1,000,000 in 8 p.c. notes issued
during the 1957-58 terms.
Note-money gathered-in last
term totalled £725,175, eked-
out by mortgages which
brought-in a further £198,000,
while the bank’s claim was cut
drastically, by £834,697 to

The influx of fixed-interest
capital now gives the balance-
sheet a more liquid tone, and
the current - asset / current-
liability ratio widened from
1.3:1 to the 2:1 which would
probably be considered satis-
factory for this class of busi-
ness. The improvement in
working-capital meant, how-
ever, that outside money
employed was brought - up
nearly to the level of share-
holders’ funds, which now total
£4,780,236, giving each 10s.

ing of 17s. 6d. ; and each of the

Horwood, Bagshaw, Ltd.
Asa manufacturer and dis-
tributor of agricultural
machinery and farm im-
plements, Horwood, Bagshaw,
Ltd., found the going difficult
last term, shrunken farm-
incomes restricting sales and
calling for a bigger and costlier
selling-effort.
Although the profit claimed
for the 15 months to June 30
last covered pref. divs. and a
steady 8 p.c. on the ords.,
reserves dropped by £36,008
and the annual provision for
taxation by £34,000 (to a mere
£6000). A £14,000 div. from the
newly-acquired Mitchell and
Co. Pty. helped to brighten the
picture, as shown in the annual
accounts.
Formed as J. H. Horwood
and Co., Ltd., in 1912, the co.
carries on a business estab-
lished well over a century ago,
the present title dating back to

were taking up interests in
South Australia and Queens-
land, and this brought about a
wave of optimism which was
consolidated later by the entry
of other U.S. oil-companies.
On November 28 the
announcement that the Shell
group would participate in the
search for petroleum in W.A.,
and would finance the 1959
operations in return for a 2/7th
interest in the operating com-
pany, induced further con-
fidence.
In Timor a similar agree-
ment with U.S. interests put
life into what had become a
rather despondent position.
It can be claimed, therefore,
that, on the whole, the oil out-
look for 1959 is much brighter
than that of a year ago.
the end of last term, part of the
consideration being 173,341
£1 8 p.c. prefs. The Victorian
co. holds- the State franchise
for Lister engines, etc., and
turns out fodder-conservation
equipment and various agri-
cultural implements, the parent
co. undertaking general-
engineering and well-boring
work in addition to manufac-
turing a big range of headers,
combines, ploughs, etc.
The Mitchell deal raised
Horwood, Bagshaw’s pref.
capital to £250,000, of which
£76,659 carries a cumulative 6
p.c., the balance representing
script issued to Mitchell share-
holders. Bonus scrip was last
sent out (three-for-five) in
1951, ord. capital reaching its
present total of £500,000 after
a 36-for-100 offer, to all share-
holders,'in 1955.
The co. shared in the post-
war prosperity brought to the
primary producer by a run of
favorable seasons and good
export-prices, but, in the last
three terms a sag in the
demand for farm machinery
has sharpened competition and
forced the absorption of in-
creased manufacturing-costs,
earnings falling by 46 p.c. in
1955-56 and the div.-rate from
10 p.c. to the current 8 p.c.
Allowing for the 15-month
term, gross earnings slipped by
over 10 p.c. last year, pre-tax
earnings for the full period,
excluding the div. from
Mitchell and Co. falling
£35,419 short of the figure re-
turned in the preceding 12
months. A heavier provision
for depreciation (£44,835, up
£18,456) contributed to the
slip.
The parent co.’s £69,803
profit (consolidated earnings
aren’t disclosed) came in at the
rate of £55,842 per annum, or
£1380 less than the sum

DANGER OF FALSE SECURITY
By GEORGE PATTERSON
After listening on two
occasions to W. C.
Wentworth, M.P., being
interviewed on tele-
vision about the defence of
Australia I switched-off in
bewilderment. Neither of the
two speakers faced-up to the
real dangers of the years to
come when a thousand-million
Asiatic horde may decide that
the time is ripe to move south.
That the horde will go through
South-east Asia like a thunder-
storm through ripe wheat is
inevitable.
The real problem in Aus-
tralia is how to protect an
area of nearly three-million
square-miles, with a coastline
ol 12,000 miles, containing a
possible population of from 15-
million to 20-million people.
Compare this problem with
that which would face the
United States of America,
which has about the same area
as Australia, a coastline of
only five-million miles and a
population of 175 million,
representing the greatest indus-
trial nation on earth. Behind
the U.S.A. will stand a vast
potential of men and machines,
a huge modern Army, Navy
and Air Force and National
Service of two years’ duration.
In Britain there is a National
Service of 18 months, and even
in tiny Switzerland national
training consists of 110 days
with 10 days each year for
eight years thereafter. Yet,
mysteriously enough, Aus-
tralia decides to reduce its
National Service Training by
half at this time when Com-
munist China has an estimated
Army of three-million and an
Air Force of 75,000 personnel
to serve 2000 planes.
hat they will be in 10 years’
time is anybody's guess.
Yet, in spite of this the co-
ordination and future objec-
tives of the Australian defence
structure is a baffling mystery,
and one asks in vain as to
what plans the experts have to
counter airborne or parachute-
and glider-landings along Aus-
tralia’s enormous coastline.
There are far too many
Australians who have no wish
to know anything about the
future. They bury their heads
in the sands of smug content-
ment and unconsciously give
tongue to “Okay Jack, I’m all
right.” On the other hand,
thousands are now regarding
it as imperative that we should
think about the future. There
were millions of unfortunates
in Europe who ignored
repeated warnings prior to
1939.
A N English statesman once
■f*- said that “the greatest
crime of our people i-s to be
afraid to tell the truth.” But an
even greater crime is to know
what should be done to safe-
guard the future and to lack
the will or the courage to do.it
regardless of the political
implications to a nation’s
leaders or its parties.
The point is that Govern-
ments do not lack personaL
courage, but their decisions are
inevitably swayed by fear of
the ballot-box, of being driven
cut of office by public resent-
ment over a measure that was
unacceptable only because it
had not been clearly, persis-
ten 11 y and courageously
explained.
No one doubts that if a call
came tomorrow Australians
would rush to enlist as they did
in two World Wars. But next
time, because of the speed of
attack and possible invasion,
it could be too late. There-
fore, if our leaders know, they
should be courageous enough
to not only warn but to act ;
or must the young be- induced
to think of the future only in
terms of looking to Britain or
America for help if the worst
should happen? They might
do that once too often.
Tn a recent issue of
“Encounter,” the British
magazine published for the
Congress for Cultural Free-
dom, Joseph who, with
his brother Stewart, is a well-
known authority on Russian
affairs, writes of the two great-
questions of policy and strategy
which now squarely confront
the nations of the world.
He is of the opinion that
“the great growth of the Soviet
structure of nuclear striking-
power has now given the
Soviets a wholly new freedom.
They are now free to under-
take almost any kind of mili-
tary adventure with conven-
tional forces. This is true
because there is no real possi-
bility of nuclear retaliation
against non-nuclear action.
Hereafter, nothing but one
side’s use of nuclear weapons
will induce the other side to
use these weapons ... so we
need to make the military-fiscal
effort to provide the mobile,
rapidly transportable and con-
ventionally armed forces that
will automatically discourage
local enemy military actions.”
C'upport for this viewpoint
comes from Dr. R. Cock-
burn, a leading British atomic
authority, who, in a recent
article in the journal of the
Royal United Service Insti-
tution, said, inter alia : “When
the major military Powers are
known to possess the means for
immediate and unstoppable
retaliation, the strategic threat
becomes neutralised.”
Even if a full-scale nuclear
offensive or defensive force
were established in Australia,
it is reasonable to believe that,
in the foreseeable future, no
enemy could so plaster the vast
continent of Australia with
nuclear bombs or missiles as
to leave no place for civilian
refuge or defensive
manoeuvres. Thus, if in the
final analysis Australia is to
be defended on the spot, it is
pertinent to consider: “What
have we to defend, and what
.are our resources?”
Tt is said that when the Japa-
-1 nese invaded China they
were forced to cling to the
rivers because whenever they
ventured inland they were cut
to pieces by guerrillas. In this
respect it is suggested that Aus-
tralia could develop a force of
a million guerrillas to be
trained year by year over a
decade. They would be men
trained in the familiar terrain
of their own country as a bul-
wark in our defence, to make
it impossible for the invader to
establish himself and to act as
a delaying force until help
arrived from allies—if any.
This guerrilla - training by
gioups could take place in
defined areas reasonably
adjacent to the homes of
trainees, and the methods of
reaching assembly areas would
always be an excellent exercise
in expedition. Such training
need not necessarily be of long
duration, nor require costly
uniforms.
The alternative is to face the
facts and reintroduce compul-
sory training for home defence
on the same scale as in the
years prior to World War I.
This system required service in
senior-cadet battalions by
youths of 18 years until 21
years of age, after which they
passed into the Citizen Mili-
tary Forces.
CJurely it is ironic for a
country which spends over
£5OO million annually on drink
and gambling out of a total
taxable personal income of
nearly £5OOO million to cry
"Poverty ” regarding the cost
of what could eventually be
the country’s salvation.
This defence measure for
helping to safeguard the future
can be “sold” to the Australian
people by earnest men. The
immediate and enduring bene-
fits of such a force through
training, discipline and patrio-
tism would be incalculable. It
would mean the transforma-
tion of Australian youth into
men with a new poise, a new
strength and a new dignity.
And if we achieved it, Aus-
tralia would gain the respect of
her neighbors and her allies in
this troubled world. This
might well be the keystone of
the nation’s survival in the
years to come.


Slow Boat to Nippon
By LES SUCH
She lays at her mooring
just off Garden Island,
in Sydney Harbor,
nestling-up to two de-
stroyers. She's going to be a
slow boat to Japan, not China,
because she’s going to tow the
destroyers, each nearly three
times her own length.
Like to do the trip?
For the best part of a week
after getting your gear aboard
you say good-bye every morn-
ing and turn-up again each
night. Tugs don’t sail on
schedule when they’ve been
laid-up for twelve years. So
the last morning you leave
home with little more than a
nod, expecting to be home
again that night. But that night,
instead, you’re on the high seas.
The take-off in the afternoon
is interesting, but too technical
to be other than confusing.
The towlines looped along
the sides of the destroyers and
the lashings being cut away as
the tug takes up the slack. The
two other tugs moving the
destroyers and the three pilots,
one on each destroyer and one
on the tug. Also a mate and
some of the crew on each
destroyer. The after-deck
resembles a madhouse with the
activity and seeming confusion.
The crew is mainly Dutch, so
there is also much yabbering
that is just double-Dutch.
Slowly you ease down the
Harbor past Rose Bay, Nielsen
Park, Watson’s Bay, a launch
carrying wives and girl-friends
cruising around until the Cap-
tain Cook steams out to pick-
up its pilot. Then at last you're
through the Heads, moving due
east into the dark, the two
destroyers strung-out astern at
long intervals and the deck-
crew from them once more
aboard the tug.
There are no spare cabins
on the tug, so the best they
can do for you is a bunk down
in the bowels on the waterline.
Before turning-in you go up
for a breather, and suddenly
smoke issues up the scuttle
from which you just emerged,
and a steward tumbles up the
ladder to wake the chief-
engineer, who is snatching
forty-winks after two sleepless
days and nights getting the
engines ready for sea.
He staggers down, rubbing
his eyes, and you contemplate
following him to get your life-
belt. But in a short while the
smoke is gone, so you go
below to sample your bunk.
Then, just as you begin to
doze, the engines stop and the
lights fail, leaving you in
complete darkness in an un-
familiar area without a torch.
This must be serious. So
you swing out of the bunk and
grope for matches, striking one
after another, stumbling over
the steel deck —slippery with oil
and grease and obstacled with
hatchcovers towards _ the
ladder ten yards away.
Halfway up, the lights come
on again, and in ten minutes the
engines resume their beat.
False alarm.
This is a big tug built for the
British Navy in U.S.A.,
and she’s been out of commis-
sion since the war. The first
shock you get is its uncleaned
state. She’s the dirtiest ship
you’ve ever seen apart from
a collier. There’s oil and
grease everywhere, and the
deck-crew look as dirty as the
engineers. You soon curse
yourself for not having bought a
boiler-suit.
All the ladders are practically
vertical and filthy with grease,
as are the decks and every
handrail you touch. So you
resign yourself to being dirty.
There are four pedigreed
dogs aboard (and a stowaway,
you find out next day)—two
black cocker-spaniels and two
French poodles, one black, the
other white. The latter is
already a dark grey, and the
cockers’ ears are saturated with
oil as they drag them around
the decks.
The second night out you see
the “moon big and shiny”
come up out of the sea like
a ball of fire. The stowaway
is put to work in the engineers’
mess, and the dogs begin to
sort themselves out. You wake
each morning early and climb
two ladders for air and a drink
of coffee, and as you watch the
sunrise you glance automati-
cally astern to see if the
destroyers are still there. As
the captain says, “If they’re
not there they’re going the
wrong way.”
There’s something pathetic
about them as they roll along
in the wake of the tug, turn-
ing this way and that, like dogs
trying to get off the leash. It’s
also weird, because you can’t
see the towlines, which are sub-
merged all the time.
The days pass slowly, but
you are prepared for this.
There are 28 persons of nine
nationalities to study. Dutch,
Greek, Scotch, German,
Maltese, Australian, Polish,
half-Indo, and English.
As the weather gets hotter
you frequently wake in the
small hours and go on deck for
coffee and fresh air. It’s stuffy
down below —no portholes
and only artificial light. And
the sustained noise of the
engines, dynamos, ventilating-
system and the wash of the sea
outside is maddening until you
get used to it.
You seldom encounter any-
one on these nocturnal trips ;
you seem to have the ship to
yourself.
The fourth day out a small
tragedy occurs. Something
goes wrong and 50 tons of fresh
water is pumped into the bilge.
So instead of an unbroken trip
we must call in at Rabaul for
more water. Also matches—■
another blunder by the provi-
dore. You were always averse
to cigarette-lighters, but you’d
welcome one now.
The fifth day out you get
a pleasant surprise. Dinner
is delayed for half-an-hour and
at last you are called in for
a feast of poultry and sweets
with ice-cream. The table is
decked-out with nuts, lollies,
beer and a cake decorated with
a model of the ship. The chief-
engineers’ birthday! The
chief is a mighty man with
engines, owning an Irish name
that sounds Scotch, a red
moustache and hair like a wire
brush.
Dy now we’re -heading due
north, a long way off the
coast, and there’s not much
visible life on the ocean. Even
the albatrosses have deserted,
but a few petrels skim the
waves. The whales that come
south at this time of the year
must keep closer inshore. No
porpoises, either, for some
reason.
You reach the deck one day
just before dinner and find
a group watching a waterspout,
a dark line reaching on a
slant from the horizon to a
cloud-bank. You are told that
they invariably slant. The
sea rises in the night and the
tug begins to kick-up her heels.
You’d heard that tugs go right
through the waves. This one
rides them, but takes a lot of
hammering on the bows. One
thing you notice, there’s no
creaking of woodwork as in
most other ships. Nearly
everything is steel, even the
table and chairs in the saloon.
But there is clanking overhead
every now and then as some-
thing breaks loose.
The tug is no place for a


fussy person. The drinking-
water is often dark-brown. The
carpenter contracts smallpox
and has to be isolated in the
surgery. There’s no doctor
aboard, but the third mate has
done a male nurse’s course.
Some of the crew are inclined
to panic—one is found in the
surgery reading the Medical
Guide. “I’ve got it!” he says.
The mate tells him not to be
silly and go and do some work.
So the days go by and the
weather gets hotter. It’s stifling
below decks. Portholes there
are none below the deck-
housing, so you only see day-
light and breathe air on deck.
Boat-drill is ordered one after-
noon, and you find out to
which of the two boats you are
allotted, also your job in
emergency. The second Satur-
day out, coming up for dinner,
you hear rifle-fire and find
a crowd on deck outside the
saloon drinking beer from the
bottle and tossing the empties
overboard for targets. There
are three Army rifles, and they
fire away thirty rounds of
ammunition at a shilling a
round. One way of entertain-
ing the crew when they get
irritable.
■pouRTEEN days out now,
hundreds of miles from
land, and only one ship sighted
so ‘ far. Flying-fish you see
frequently, but nothing on the
wing except a couple of frigate-
birds.
The sea has risen consider-
ably with a s.-e. wind, and the
towline is jumping and shiver-
ing. You find it difficult to walk
now owing to the odd
motion of the ship, and the
steward wets the tablecloth in
the saloon to prevent the
crockery from slipping.
The position of the destroyers
is peculiar. The nearest is
away to port, but head-on,
while the farthest is away to
starboard moving broadside-
cn.
You learn later that the
rudder has broken loose in the
bad sea and jammed, steering
the ship to starboard and
taking at least two knots off
our speed, so that although
the weather is in our favor
we are still moving at walking-
pace.
A quarter of the journey is
over. Coming on deck at night
you sometimes get a shock
glancing astern to see the port
and starboard lights of another
vessel so close. The tow, of
course, with the lights from
butane gas that lasts for
three months.
The fresh-water problem is
really grim now. Not a drip in
the taps in the shower-rooms,
so you learn to do without
washing. Which wouldn’t be
too bad if the weather wasn’t
tropical and the ship a clean
one. Shaving ceases and the
most extraordinary beards
sprout amongst the crew. And
still 500 miles to Rabaul!
One thing saves you: the
“swim.” For this, you go out
on the after-deck and climb
down a manhole in a hatch to
the deck below, then walk aft
through a watertight door and
drop down through another
manhole just big enough to
squeeze through into a sea-
water .tank. The water is
within a foot of the deckhead
and swishes from side to side
with the rolling of the ship,
massaging you like the surf
Hanging on to the steel ladder
you dive beneath and open
your eyes in the gloom. Under
there, the noise of the engines
and propeller-shafts is as
deafening as thunder.
T>Y this time you’ve acquired
the carpenter’s bunk in a
two-berth cabin on the main
deck forward, with a fan and
the second cook.
One morning on the after-
deck you find the bosun clean-
ing flying-fish that came
aboard during the night. This
often happens, and someone
gets fresh fish for breakfast.
The weather gets progress-
ively hotter, and the barometer
soars to 90°. The best time
is the middle of the night,
drinking coffee on the cat-
walk of the bridge and
smoking and yarning with the
mate on watch—in underpants.
By this time you know the ship
pretty well after making
dozens of sketches of parts of
it and a large color-drawing of
the ship itself from a plan.
This the carpenter promptly
frames to hang in the saloon.
And it is an interesting ship.
There are only two of its kind
in the world. Measuring 217 ft.
long, 1774 tons displacement, it
has four mighty engines, twin
propellers and rudders, colossal
lifting-gear forward and aft,
and below a complete
engineer's shop equipped with
a giant lathe and milling-
machine, amongst other things,
a carpenter’s shop with band-
and circular-saws, three sets of
diving-gear and a decompres-
sion chamber. Over the wheel-
house is an outsize searchlight,
and another aft mounted on
the kingposts.
But comfort there is none,
except for the captain and
chief-engineer, who each have
a spacious cabin with four port-
holes and their own shower-
room.
The deck-crew’s quarters are
little better than a wind-
jammer’s foc’s’le, and the
engineers and culinary staff are
berthed in tiny, stuffy rooms.
Every entrance is a watertight-
door and every companionway
a nearly vertical ladder. Being
six-feet tall you are continually
bumping your head and bark-
ing your shins.
Somebody finds the ship’s
bell, and with block and tackle
it is hoisted and rigged on the
bridge. Like everything else
on the ship it is large and solid,
big enough for a battleship,
cast in iron with the ship's
name moulded in it So from
now on we know the time with-
out looking.
One day, after much activity
on the after-deck, more tow-
line is let out, and now there
is about threequarters-of-a-
mile of tow. This is for easier
towing.
The sea flattens as you near
New Britain and the wind dies
down. And suddenly there’s no
fresh-water left and still a
day’s run from Rabaul.
The engineers are still work-
ing on the distiller, but it’s not
fixed yet. So for lunch you
have bottled beer. The irony!
You remember the grim, beer-
less years in Sydney and the
swill and scramble and search-
ing for the pub where it was
“on.” And now, no longer a
beer-drinker for health reasons,
you find yourself on a ship with
no water to drink—only beer!
So you drink coffee made with
seawater.
That night the lights of a
ship come into view and the
mate on. watch attracts its
attention with the signal-lamp.
Then follows much flashing on
both sides and blasphemy and
obscenities from the mate.
Neither can understand the
other’s signals. We learn next
day it was a Japanese mother-
ship. The searchlights are both
turned on, the after one shining
on the tow, and the water turns
technicolor blue where the
light strikes.
"jV'EXT morning you wake to
see the coast of New
Britain. Sighting land after a
period at sea is always an up-
lifting experience. And this
one is no exception. Right
ahead are two volcanoes, one
still active. A launch brings out
the doctor and Customs. The
doc. examines the carpenter
straight away while the whole
ship holds its breath awaiting
the verdict. At last —chicken-
pox, not smallpox!
Loud cheers! A ciean bill
of health. Then comes the tug
to take charge of the tow, and
this is a manoeuvre worth
watching as the towline is
transferred to the small tug.
Now we’re free to go into the
wharf as soon as the pilot
comes out.
Rabaul is much as you
expected. Most people know
about these parts nowadays,
but it’s nonetheless interesting
for the few hours you have
ashore. The lush growth and
tropical scents and the slow-
moving, colorful natives. The
stock of fresh fruit is replen-
ished as well as water and
matches, papaw, pineapple,
coconuts, etc., and that night


you’re out in the stream again
while a party goes aboard the
destroyer to fix the rudder that
caused the trouble. Then
good-bye Rabaul, and away on
the last leg of the long tow.
Now we’re near the Line,
and the temperature soars ro
98° on the bridge. Conversa-
tion ceases, and at night the
crew off watch is scattered
about the deck for air. Some
have their bedding up there.
Day after day the equatorial
heat continues, and there’s little
relief at night, as you find when
you take your bed-roll up on
the foredeck and get drenched
by a squall as soon as you
settle-down. The dogs 101 l about
panting with their tongues
out. None of them is suited
to the tropics—the cockers with
their thick fur-coats, or the
poodles with their sheep’s wool.
You pass the Line, and the
weather still holds, flat sea, little
wind, technicolor sunsets.
But apart from the heat,
life on the tug is simple and
uncomplicated. You live in
shorts and slippers and sleep
in your skin —the cooks work
in swimming-togs.
One afternoon after lunch
comes a setback and some
diversion. The engines stop,
the lights fail and immediately
the cabin becomes untenable,
a black hole with no oxygen
as the fan and vent cut out.
You grope your way in the
dark towards the deck and
stumble up the ladder for light
and air. As soon as the tug
stops, the three ships come
rapidly together, pulled by the
weight of the towlines, some-
thing like eighteen tons.
This in heavy weather could
mean disaster. So we’re lucky
it’s a flat sea. After half-an-
hour we go ahead again slowly,
But soon everything cuts out
again except the lights. Some-
thing has to be fixed in the
engine-room. Suddenly a
swimming party is in full swing
as a rope-ladder is lowered
from the after-deck and half
the crew commence to dive
and jump into the blue, glassy
sea. Some go off the boat-deck,
and there is much yelling-out
in Dutch. There’s nothing like
a swim in hot weather to bring
out the Huckleberry Finn in
grown men.
At last you move ahead
again at 2\ knots while the un-
lucky engineers toil in 120° all
night. All parts of the ship
indoors are now completely
unbearable with no ventilators
or fans working.
The crew scatter all over the
decks again, but before long
are driven to shelter by more
rain. This is one of those
nights you could do without.
Next morning, engines fixed,
we're steaming again at 6\
knots through a sea without a
ripple, resembling nothing so
much as indigo oil. And
though there is rto visible life
here, porpoises, seabirds or
even flying-fish, it’s odd the
little bits of flotsam that go
past. A thin stick, maybe of
bamboo; a small piece of
pineboard ; and once a broom-
head festooned with seaweed.
YX7E are now in the Northern
Hemisphere and expect
some relief from the heat ; but
it’s a long time coming. At
last you wake one morning to
a grey sea and sky with
drizzling rain and the tempera-
ture down to 80°. But as
the day wears on the sun comes
out sending the glass up again.
Then another breakdown, and
over goes the rope-ladder
followed by the swimmers. This
time the stop is brief and the
cry of “All aboard” brings
them racing for the ladder,
scared of being left behind,
Like a train at the station.
Ever since Rabaul the ship
has been getting progressively
cleaner. Alleyways have been
soojeed and painted, and with
the help of water, wind and
usage the grease is disappearing
from decks, ladders and hand-
rails.
So you wash the dogs But
this is a heartbreak. After the
soaking and soaping with soft-
soap from the bosun, the
rinsing and the rubbing and
drying, next day they are just
as dirty. Some dogs will
always find a dirty place. And
there are plenty on this ship.
•
The temperature still stays
up. For over three weeks it s
been above 80 and up to 100°.
Soon we pass the Tropic of
Cancer, and though we are now
m the Temperate Zone the
cabin is still an oven in the
ay lme in spite of the fan and
vent. Foi only the steel deck
is between your bunk and the
blazing sun on the foredeck.
About this time two more
stowaways make their appear-
ance. Dragonflies! Three-
hundred miles from the nearest
land, which is a small island to
leeward.
The flying-fish have appeared
again regularly, and one morn-
ing a school of small tuna leads
the ship in formation like a
squadron of planes. Now you
get day after day of oily calm
with hot sun and light breeze
—good towing weather. In a
matter of days, barring acci-
dents or storms, you should be
in Japan.
Looking astern at the tow
you regard them almost with
affection, as old friends,
You've watched them heave
and roll and dip and strain at
their bridles this way and that,
You’ve watched them in the
rain and on moonlight nights.
And each time the tug stopped
the Y seemed to come up to
sa y “Hullo. ’ Now they are
streaked red with rust, and in
this calm weather look like
painted ships on a painted

WHY I WRITE ABOUT THE SEA
Right down to the edge of the sea, the land
Is cluttered with all measure and kind of goods.
They’ve got a sign pointing “Lavatory” on the rocks.
Now, if you listen to me, you may understand
Why I don’t read Wordsworth, any more, for his fields and
woods.
It is a huge, untidy vessel in the dry docks
Of longitude and latitude, this loaded land.
And for passengers? Phew! there’s scarcely room to
stand.
But out from the beach, from that margin of smooth green
water,
From that littoral which is the haunt of scavenging gulls,
The “ship” looms important, and looks
Through the glass (though certainly a freighter )
Large and majestic: and so the ocean pulls
Wool over my eyes, and I write thus in my books.
QUEENSLAND.
JOHN BLIGHT.
MOUNT LOFTY
Such blackness of night and storm all round Mount Lofty
And out of the ravaged trees that flute-like note:
It was the magpie, softly, coolly, softly
Like a creek amongst moss, trying his dawn-song out:
Not wishing to wake the morning light too soon,
Not calling his kind but, calm as the creek below,
Deep in the peace of one sweet thought of his own,
Trying his song to see how it would go.
\
In that wild night so torn with rage and misery
It could have been some unborn child that stirred
At life's first taste with movement sweet as melody,
Or the whole world rehearsing ; and if the bird
Knew nothing of that, clearly it never doubted
Daybreak would come and it would sing full-throated.

within 10ft. before he saw us.
He never hesitated, but lowered
his head and charged.
Dutchy swerved to avoid
him, but stumbled, and the
ram’s head took him on the
thigh, and brought him down.
1 don’t know if a ram could
kill a man, Tut I think Dutchy
would have been killed that
day had he been alone. The
fall had winded him, and the
ram was rearing and bringing
his hoofs down on Dutchy’s
ribs. He had been struck
several times, before I reached
him. I grabbed the ram by
one horn, reached over and
got a front leg, and tossed him
on his back.
By this time several men had
arrived from the pub, and we
tied the ram’s legs with a bit
of wire. Dutchy had a lot of
bruises ; one on his thigh,
where the ram first hit him, was-
a nasty one. We were cracking
jokes at his expense, and
moving towards the pub, to
patch him up, when one of the
men said: “Wonder what the
ram was interested in when
you first saw him?”
We went back to the hole,
and at the bottom was one of
the old chaps, Jimmy Comer-
ford. We thought he was dead,
and were greatly relieved when
he looked up and called for
help. Ropes were brought, and
we soon had him up. He was
able to walk, with help, and
said he wasn’t hurt, except for
a few scratches.
At the pub we heard his
story. The ram had been
noted for some time for his
attacks on women and
children ; after being shorn a
month previously he had also
attacked a man. Losing his
heavy fleece had made him
faster, and had not improved
his temper. The owner, after
receiving several complaints,
had shaped a piece of tin and
fastened it to the ram’s horns
in such a way that it could
see to feed and not do any
damage. But Jimmy was a very
kind-hearted old man, and,
coming over to the pub to
collect his mail, or whatever old
gentlemen come over to pubs
for, he had noticed the attach-
ment, and thought the ram had
got his head stuck in a tin. He
went to a lot of trouble to
remove it, and the ram
promptly knocked him down.
He managed to get on his feet
again, and got hold of the
horns, but the ram was
stronger, and they went back-
wards, until Jimmy fell into the
hole. It was about 15ft. deep,
but he was lucky enough to
fall on his feet. He said the
ram never left the hole, and he
was expecting it to join him
any minute on the bottom. It
would have been the end of
Jimmy.
After fixing his bruises and
pouring a few rums into him
a couple of the chaps took him
to his camp and put him to
bed, where he went to sleep
at once. A tough man, Jimmy
Comerford. And he was 80
years old.
At the pub every new arrival
was regaled with the story
of the fight between Dutchy
and the ram. That young man
was being well looked after
by Mrs. Norris and her three
daughters. He was laying back
in an armchair, looking and
acting like a wounded hero.
I let him have his brief
moment, but he knew what I
would have to say later on.
In the bar the subject
of what to do about the ram
was being hotly debated, and it
was decided that the owner be
ordered to destroy it. So a
deputation, consisting of all
hands except Sid, who could
not leave the bar, and Dutchy,
who was injured, strolled over
to inform the owner of the
decision, made by the leading
citizens of Cullenbone.
Tom Buckley, who was about
the drunkest man in the crowd,
was elected spokesman. The
owner, a quiet sober man,
listened gravely to Tom's
oration, delivered while cling-
ing to the gatepost, then
nodded and said, “Come with
me,” and led the way to the
hole, where the ram lay dead
on the bottom.
“I heard about him knocking
Jimmy down this afternoon,
so I shot him,” he said.
That remark left the deputa-
tion with nothing further to
do but go back to the pub. The
excitement was over. The
married men went off to their
homes, to relate the story to
their wives and children, and
the rest played euchre for a
couple of hours, and then
rolled into bed.
All were in agreement that
it was one of the greatest days
Cullenbone had ever known.
CUd Norris was driving to
Gulgong the next day, so
we went with him. We had been
in Gulgong earlier that year,
with George Ruenalf, but were
too busy to see much of the
place. On the way in Sid
pointed out the leads we
crossed: the Magpie, Pig and
Whistle, Engine Paddock and
the Three Mile. These leads
ran for several miles before
joining-up with the fabulous
Black Lead.
Gulgong is a strange little
town. Its streets are narrow
and winding, following the
tracks that ran between the
tents of the diggers. In the
peak of the rush there had
been over 30,000 people on the
field. Now there might be 500.
All the old hands, the left-
overs from the early days, were
prepared to stake their lives
that there was more gold under
the town than had ever been
taken out of the Black Lead.
They could be right, for the
town is in the middle of the
field, and “Gold is where you
find it.” I heard many stories
of underground tanks and
cellars showing good prospects,
but the town council has a
rigid ban on any form of
mining within the town limits.
So, if the old diggers are right,
the gold is still under Gulgong
township.
The discovery of Gulgong is
said to have been accidental.
A bullock-team was bogged at
what was known later as
Surface Hill, and after getting
the wagon back onto solid
ground the teamster was
scraping the mud off the wheels
when he saw a slug of gold.
Knowing something of gold he
investigated the bog, and soon
realised he had found some-
thing worth while. But he
could not have had the faintest
idea that his find would lead
to what is said by many
geologists and. mining experts
to have been the greatest
alluvial goldfield the world has
known.
The official records of
Gulgong show that 13J- tons
of gold was bought by the
banks in the town in the five
years 1871-1876. The old hands
laughed when I mentioned this
seemingly huge quantity of
gold. Bill Goodman and Ned
Saunders, both ,of whom had
been among the first on the
field, were scornful. Said Bill:
“You could multiply that by
ten, and you would still be a
long way out. There were
thousands of foreigners here,
and they sold enough to live on,
and took all they could carry
back to their own country. And
you could get £4 5s an ounce
in Sydney, as against £3 16s. 6d.
here. Gold sold in Sydney
would not be recorded in Gul-
gong.”
Ned chipped-in: “Every
time the coach went out you
would see men wearing as
many as five gold-belts loaded-
up till they were waddling with
the weight of them.”
These belts, made of
leather or canvas, would hold
about 81b. (avoirdupois) of gold.
Incidentally, Bill or Ned
always spoke of these alien
men as either “furriners” or
“Rooshians.” There were never
any Chinese on Gulgong. After
the riots at Lambing Flat (noW
Young), Chinese were barred
from goldfields.
Bill Goodman, with two
mates, John Hunter and
Stewart Dawson, had taken
£6OOO from their claim on the
Black Lead. His mates, both
Sydney men, had gone back
to the city and used their
shares to build up big busi-
nesses. When I asked Bill what
he had done with his share, he
grinned ruefully and replied:
“I put it back into the ground,
looking for more.” Ned
Saunders had done the same.
Both men had the reputation
of backing unlucky mining
ventures.
Curface Hill, where the
gold was among the grass-
roots, was near Happy Valley.
The whole system of the Gul-
gong goldfields was like creeks
coming together till they
formed a river. Cross Roads,
Pipeclay, Budgee, Eurunderee,
Golden Gully, Log Paddock,
Home Rule, Lindurn, Cooyal,
Canadian Lead. Combandry,

the town. Below, there were

AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Sydney Racing
To produce a horse ready to
win a sprint in the best com-
pany after an absence from
racing of several months is no
mean feat. Gold Stakes, easy
winner of the Canterbury
Park Flying Handicap, a mem-
ber of Jack Green’s Randwick
team, hadn’t started since fail-
ing in the Q.T.C. Stradbroke
Handicap last June. Gold
Stakes won the £894 stake-
money without much effort.
He is engaged in the A.J.C.
Challenge Stakes and also in
the main Melbourne autumn
sprints. He is bound to be
improved by his latest effort.
In some races a runner
towers above rivals, and keen
enthusiasts give little thought
to most of the opposition. This
happened at Canterbury
when Ulandra toyed with t'le
other five starters for the main
distance event, the Canterbury
Park Handicap, 9\ furlongs.
It was an easily earned £874
for Ulandra’s connections and
an armchair ride for confident
but clever horseman George
Moore. Ulandra was last of
the sextet until the home-turn
was reached. Moore then gave
him more rein and the hot
favorite strolled in. Ulandra
is entered for the A.J.C. Anni-
versary Handicap, \\ mile, on
January 26. He won at that
distance at Randwick in June
last when the track was heavy.
Form of Misty Dawn,
winner of the Canterbury
Park Belmore Stakes, a gradua-
tion stakes, had been so poor
that it was no wonder she
started at long odds. She
hadn’t won a city or provincial
race. A week before her sur-
prising win, the Edwardsii
(imp.) mare had finished in the
ruck in a similar event, also
at Canterbury, won by Triple
Edition. It was rather a
startling form improvement.
Bert Creagh, acting-handi-
capper to the Sydney Turf
Club, must have been happy
over his assessments for the
Canterbury Park Welter, as in
a field of 10 four crossed the
finishing-line almost as one
horse. Coronado, not fancied
by the public, won by a nose
from Calculator, with Empress
Fay a further nose away third
and King’s Bench half-a-head
away fourth. King’s Bench
came from last and appeared
unlucky not to have won.
Two more jockeys came
down in a race from the 7j-
furlongs chute at Canterbury
Park, fortunately without
serious result. Anyway, any
race-accident must have its
“Beats me what you see in it—they seem to be doing
exactly the same things they did yesterday .”
effect on the jockey concerned,
and while there are races from
this starting-barrier there will
always be the risk of acci-
dent. The S.T.C. committee
will discuss the latest mishap
in the Belmore Stakes, in
which the favorite Robin Tout
and outsider Wisecrack fell
near the 5| furlongs. It was a
costly crash to thousands of
punters, who regarded Robin
Tout as a near good thing. The
club has a safety margin of
18 starrters from this chute,
but few backers support horses
drawn wide.
Maybe the S.T.C. could
increase races at furlongs
by a quarter of a furlong by
removing some buildings, or
it should consider further
reducing fields to 15 starters.
Canterbury is a handy race-
course for most folk, but as a
track it suffers by comparison
with some of those long since
closed up. The S.T.C. had
its chance to make Moorefield
a top racecourse, while a race-
meeting could be held at Rose-
bery today if all facilities were
available.
Backing most horses on race-
form is no short-cut to riches.
For instance, Count Rego,
unplaced to Carib in Canter-
bury Park Two - year - old
Graduation . Stakes, looked a
safe wager for the sprint and
started at odds-on, but he never
threatened danger. Carib had
shown poor form in three
starts, but he won easily.
Aroha, surprise winner of the
fillies’ Two-year-old Maiden,
had started once at 100 to 1
and had finished 12th of 17
starters to Chateau Clair at
Randwick last month. Carib
started second favorite, but
Aroha was a comparative out-
sider. She won well after
covering a lot of extra ground,
but seemed lucky to beat the
grey Fraction.

T. J. Smith, trainer of Carib,
now in N.Z. for the yearling-

is raced by Mr. and Mrs. ft. F.
Porter and is by Bold
Buccaneer from Lambrequin
(imp.) from Lambert Simnel
from Beauty Crest by Gains-
borough, and on his perfor-
mance he should go far in
racing. His half-brother Video

but Carib has a number of
English relatives who have won
several races in good company.
A number of Australian

437 lots, will be offered, and as
usual many of the youngsters
will be found racing in Aus-
ti alia when the time comes for
them to sport silk, late this
year. Australian visitors will
be able to attend the Welling-

will be held on this Saturday
and the following Monday and
Saturday. The £lO,OOO

be run on Saturday.
Ballynully finished out of »
place several lengths from th*
winner Kateena at Rand-

wasn’t fancied much, but the
outing, his first in public, did
the colt a lot of good, and

Maiden Handicap for Two-

the AJ.C.’s first twilight
fixture. Ballynully is by the
new sire Nullabor (imp.), a
son of Nasrullah, and is from

to the stables of Canterbury

ridden several winners already,
most of them at tracks out-

the 22,500 attendance was
larger than anticipated. As two
favorites and three second-

the public went home happy.
The second twilight meeting

Melbourne Racing
Ron Hutchinson is a good
rider over any journey, but he
is probably the best jockey in
Australia in distance events.
He got Globe home in the
two-miles Inkerman Handicap
at Caulfield last Saturday, and
it is unlikely that the aged
Helios gelding could have won
with anybody else in the
saddle. “Hutchy” took advant-
age of the slow early pace to
allow Globe to open up a six-
lengths break on the field. With
none of the other riders
anxious to lead the chase after
him, Hutchinson was able to
conserve his mount’s strength
in front and, when challenges
did come in the straight, get
an extra effort out of him
that just landed the' money.
It was Globe’s first win in
18 months, during which time
he had started 17 times. Old
Oxley, who won the Inkerman
in 1956 and 1957, ran fourth
behind Globe, and the 10-
year-old gelding is now to be
retired. This will be the third
time he has gone to the pad-
dock, but he can hardly come
back again.
All inducements have failed
to persuade Riverina appren-
tice Roy Higgins to settle in
Melbourne, but the lad makes
regular trips to the city and
rarely fails to make the visits
pay. He had the mount on
the three-year-o}d filly Belle
Vixen, who was backed from
fours to 6-to-4 to beat the colts
in the nine-furlongs Roseberry
Handicap. Higgins brought
the filly down the outside of
the track from ninth on the
turn to win comfortably. Belle
Vixen, who is by Sweet
William from Racefox, is a
half-sister to Fresh Boy, who
was third in the 1947 Caulfield
Cup and second in the Mel-
bourne Cup in the same year.
Owner Doug Wheelhouse be-
lieves Belle Vixen has the same
staying potential, and already
has the filly’s programme
aimed at the Cups next spring.
Two-year-old filly Rhexia’s
win in the five-furlongs Chic-
quita Stakes at Caulfield was
her third in a row, and illus-
trated the luck of the racing
game. The filly was one of
the big draft offered by V.R.C.
chairman Sir Chester Mani-
fold from his Halindert Stud
at last year’s sales, but nobody
was anxious to buy her, and,
in Sir Chester’s words, he was
left with her. She is a Mea-
dow Mist filly from Lulan, but
has not got the characteristic
grey coat of most of that sire’s
stock. Despite her good
record, Rhexia was a 4-to-l
chance on Saturday, mainly
because the speedy Ritmar
reappeared in the race after a
spell.* Ritmar showed her cus-
tomary early dash, but Rhexia
had no trouble to run her
down over the last furlong. It
should not be long, however,
before Ritmar wins again.
Favored Beau’s win in the
5| - furlongs Juvenile Stakes
was the reward for consistent
form. He had run a second
and two thirds from his pre-
vious three starts. A sturdy
Chavey Down-Querida colt,
Favored Beau seems to thrive
on racing—he has been up
since October, and Saturday’s
race was his seventh start. He
still looked in splendid con-
dition, a tribute to his trainer
and part-owner, Tony Lopes.
Frank Dimattina is the other
owner, and it was appropriate
that the partnership should win
a race last Saturday. They
owned the good mare Chic-
quita, after whom the first race
on the Caulfield programme
was named.

Although Vogel had a lot
of racing as a two- and three-
year-old, it was not until this
season that the New Zealand-
bred Sabaean gelding showed
much ability. With a win in
the Normanby Handicap at
Caulfield, Vogel’s recent record
is three wins and a second
from four starts. He sped over
the mile of the Normanby in
1.36 f, to qlip l-10sec. off
Plato’s track-record. Last
month he ran a mile at Moonee
Valley in 1.374-, which is just
!sec. outside the record for
that course. Admitting that
Melbourne courses are light-
ning fast at present, it is still
clear that Vogel has developed
into a good-class handicapper.
There was a noisy demon-
stration after Conclusive won
the 10-furlongs Rowena Welter
at Caulfield. The reason was
that the Boissier gelding had
failed at the same track the
previous Saturday when he
went out a warm favorite in
the Silvan trial. In the trial,
however, Conclusive carried
9.2, and many knowledgeable
racing men refuse to back a
horse with more than 9st. in
trial company. In the Welter
he dropped to 8.6, and on the
different scale of weights was
carrying only 61b. above the
minimum. Trainer Charlie
Waymouth had an added
reason for the gelding’s im-
proved showing. He said that
Conclusive was prone to
rheumatics, and that the
weather on Saturday, with the
temperature in the nineties,
suited the gelding.
Two .new records were
written into the book at Caul-
field. Vogel set new figures
for the mile, and later in the
day Astounding ran the six
furlongs of the Park Stakes
in 1.10 to improve by |sec.
on Sir Pyrean’s record for the
course. Astounding is only a
three-year-old colt, and it is
unusual for such a young horse
to hold a track record. Oddly
enough two previous holders
of the six-furlongs record at
Caulfield ran in the Park
Stakes Nevanna and Sir
Pyrean.

“Sawtell”: Interesting
youngster racing in Adelaide
in the current season is Galileo,
younger brother of Jordan.
Their dam, Chariot, has
already produced eight win-
ners, but has some way to go
to reach the record of her dam,
the great Charivari, whose 16
foals were all winners.
“ P.O.M.C. ” : “Audax
Minor,” racing scribe of the
“New Yorker” no less, wrote
in a recent issue: “Of course,
it’s difficult for a jockey to
judge how fast he is going
when he’s in front, because
there are no horses around
him to serve as a gauge.” Well,
if that’s the rule outside Aus-
tralia, it's no wonder our
hoops do so well abroad. In
the opinion of the average
Australian trainer, the jockey
(or experienced apprentice)
who hasn’t thoroughly learned
how to judge pace, in front or
behind, small field or large,
simply can’t ride.

The Trots
On Friday night last
Bathurst’s glamor pacer First
Kiss spreadeagled a top-class
field to win Harold Park’s
Flying Handicap in the record
time of 2min. 35sec., record-
ing a mile rate of 2.67, which
has rarely been bettered at
Harold Park. Starting from
scratch, the six-year-old Loyal
Raider horse beat champion
pacer Fettle (12yds.) by two
lengths, with 66-to-l pop First
Variety 24- lengths away third.
First Kiss was meeting a
field of top-class pacers for the
first time. He was forced to
run three wide for the first
half-mile. Bannockburn had
raced to a four-lengths lead
with a lap to go, but at the
three furlongs First Kiss had
overtaken him and was well
clear on entering the straight,
Fettle went out after the
leader, but First Kiss raced
right away to win very com-
fortably.
Trainer-driver Joe Turnbull
said after the race that First
Kiss would not run in the Free-
for-All on Friday night, but
would have his next start in the
£6OOO Harold Park Cup on
Friday week (Jan. 23). First
Kiss is almost certain to start
favorite for the Inter-
Dominion Championship, in
which he is handicapped on
12yds. behind, with other
N.S.W. pacers Fettle, Diabolo
Don, First Variety, Mineral
Spring and Malniri. Sibelia is
on 36yds. behind. The other
17 pacers from N.S.W. are on
scratch.

The Cricketers
Last time Australia entered
a third Test against England
two up was in 1950-51, when
it went on to win the third
Test (also played in Sydney)
by an innings. Australia also
entered the third 1946-47 and
third 1948 Tests after having
won the first two Tests, and
the third Test in both those
series was drawn ; but Australia
both times went on to win
the rubber. Last time England
entered a third Test against
Australia two up was in 1936-
37, when Australia fought back
to win the last three Tests.

Admittedly it was raining
when play was due to begin
in the Test on Saturday, and
it had been raining (lightly) for
some time earlier ; but the rain
was well and truly over by the
time play was due to resume
after lunch (1.30 p.m.), and
play should have been possible
then. That it was not was
due to the condition of what
had been the wicket for the
N.S.W.-Q. Shield match the
previous week. It should have
been covered, as the Test
wicket was while the Shield
match was in progress. Result
was a terrific loss of revenue
to the Cricket Associations
who would have benefited, as
well as exasperation aplenty
for the paying public—who,
judging by the numbers lined-
up, may have set a cricketing
record-attendance for the
S.C.G. Such a fiasco shouldn’t
be allowed again.
When Australia was battling
in one of the 1956 Tests, lan
Johnson is reported to have
said that the Australians’ only
hope would be to pray for
rain. “You’d be wasting your
time,” Peter May is reported
to have replied. “Don’t forget
we Have a professional on our
side.” He meant the Rev.
David Sheppard, whom May
wanted in his side for Aus-
tralia but who preferred to
stay to minister to his flock.
But May, watching his team’s
recent pathetic batting dis-
plays, must have often felt like
praying for the help the rev.
batsman could surely have
given.

“K.R.”: Ray Robinson’s
Between Wickets, first pub-
lished in 1945 and recently
revised and brought up to
1958 in a Fontana paperback
edition, is very anecdotal,
bright and cricket-wise and
contains a mass of statistical
information such as, for
instance, that Grimmett
bow'led against Bradman in
25 first-class innings, dis-
missed him 10 of those times
(six for less than 40) and Don
scored six 100’s against him,
with a highest of 258. I picked
him out on only one point— -he
omits Lindwall from the six
(not five) men who have taken
more than 200 wickets in
Sheffield Shield cricket in the
66 years from when the com-
petition began in 1892. The
others are Jones, Ironmonger,'
Grimmett, Fleetwood - Smith
and O’Reilly. Lindwall passed
the 200 in 1957-58.

“H.F.”: Talking about
W. G. Grace’s two visits here
(B. 7/1/’59), he was most
unpopular in Australia, and on
his first visit was known as
“the graceless Grace” and on
his second visit it was said
that he lost his temper soon
after landing here and never
regained it during the tour.
It was at the end of this 1891
visit that Lord Sheffield pre-
sented the Sheffield Shield for
annual competition between
the States.

More on the Tennis
Any friends the Lawn Tennis
Association of Australia did
have left after years of riding
roughshod over all counter-
opinion and criticism it must
have lost after its woeful handling
of affairs this season. A pity, for
amateur tennis in Australia has
never been in greater need of
friends than right now. However
much one may itch to deliver a
“serves ’em right” blast at the
L.T.A.A., it is nevertheless a cry-
ing shame to see the amateur
game faced with the lean years
which threaten it now after its years
of plenty.
At one stroke the amateur tennis
people have lost their two main
sources of income—the Davis Cup
and their equally big rake-off from
Jack Kramer’s professional troupe.
Evidently confident that they had
the Cup in safe keeping as a
revenue-producer for years to come,
the L.T.A.A. chose this season to
indulge in a vendetta with
Kramer. To date Kramer has won
every round, and the L.T.A.A. has
lost not only substantial hard cash
but the incalculable value of good-
will.
In the past two seasons Kramer’s
circus has toured Australia in
amiable and mutually profitable
co-operation with the amateur
bodies. The pros, have not begun
their tours until all major amateur
tournaments, Davis Cup matches
and State and national champion-
ships were finished, giving the
amateur people every chance to
skim the cream of audience interest
in the game. Then, when they have
gone into action, they have helped
the amateur game directly with
hefty cash contributions and
indirectly by staging tennis clinics
and exhibitions for young
enthusiasts all over the country.
This season, however, in what
looked a prize case of cutting off
the nose to spite the face, the-
L.T.A.A. apparently decided that
Kramer was responsible for plum-
meting attendances .at amateur
tourneys, opened hostilities without
warning at a stage when Kramer
had just about fixed-up all arrange-
ments for this season’s tour. The
L.T.A.A. forbade Kramer the use of
the facilities of any of its affiliated
organisations—which meant any
suitable tennis arenas in Australia.
Next they forbade umpires to
officiate at Kramer tournaments,
and threatened to organise a
“world-wide ban” on the Kramer
troupe.
Here the L.T.A.A. began to look
a bit foolish, but its crowning
puerility, particularly as con-
cerned goodwill in N.S.W., was the
churlish refusal to co-operate with
Kramer in the benefit arranged for
that most popular of Australian
tennis-players, Jack Crawford. Any
comment necessary on this was
made by the bumper crowd that
turned up at the benefit put on in
Sydney by the pros, last week.
This gate assured Crawford of a
sum well past the £lO,OOO mark —•
no thanks to the amateur bodies
for which he had done so much.
So now the Kramerites will start
their tour with a degree of good-
will and sympathy they have never
had before, and just about every-
one will be getting a cut except the
people who should be —the amateur
tennis people who supply Kramer
with his troupers.
Some idea of just what amateur
tennis will miss out on through
the prize shenanikins of its govern-
ing body—and, incidentally, of who
gets what out of the pro.-tennis
gates—can be gathered from figures
for Kramer’s last two tours in the
1956-57 and 1957-58 seasons. Gross
receipts from these two tours were
£267,228. Expenses, mainly trans-
port, took £61,362, leaving net
receipts of £205,866. Payments to
the players accounted for something
over half of this —£112,875 —and
Australian income-tax collected
£4860. Most of the remainder went
to Australian amateur tennis bodies
as follows: country centres,
£11,751; Sydney, £18,298; Mel-
bourne, £16,299; Brisbane, £10,319;
Adelaide, £10,370; Perth, £3065;
Hobart, £1353—£71,455 in all,
leaving Kramer the respectable but
by no means disproportionate net
proceeds of £16,676 from original
takings of more than £250,000.
P. M.
“Keima”: Despite all the
grouches about Kramer, I
think the present set-up,
whereby after just about every
Davis Cup challenge-round
one or two stars turn pro., is
a good thing. Gives younger
players their chance, and
means a change of faces. Think
of it, were there no pro. tennis,
year after year for the last
nine or so we would probably
have seen Sedgman and Mc-
Gregor (perhaps, after a year
or two, Sedgman and Hoad)
playing against Gonzales and
Trabert. Neither Rosewall nor
Seixas, for two, would have
got a game. Would have
become mighty boring.
“Zorok”: All the clamor
about the U.S.A. playing the
Peruvian Olmedo in the Davis
Cup came, of course, from the
U.S.A. Australia had no
grounds for protest, and no
thought of doing so. There
are cricketing precedents. Aus-
tralia accepted without protest
the presence in former England
Test-teams of the magical
Indians “Ranji,” “Duleep” and
Pataudi, while England did not
object to Australia’s playing
that cagey New Zealander
Clarrie Grimmett.

In the N.S.W. 880yds. free-
style final on Saturday night
John Konrads became the first
swimmer to break 9min. for
the distance. His time was
Bmin. 59.65ec., breaking Aus-
tralian Murray Rose’s world-
record 9.13.5, set in the U.S.A.
on Aug. 2, 1958. Konrads thus
becomes world 800-metre
record holder, too. Konrads's
previous best for 880yds. was
9.14.5, set on Feb. 22, 1958, in
the course of a remarkable
1650yds. swim.

“Veryl” : Not unexpectedly,
and quite deservedly, Herb
Elliott received the Helms
award as top Australian
amateur sportsman for 1958.
He had already been named in
the A.A.P. poll as the out-
standing male athlete of the
world in 1958, and won several
other awards. At the same
time it must be remembered
that Elliott was not the only
Australian sportsman (or
sportswoman) to perform out-
standingly in 1958.


UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
FAREWELL EMPIRE
“Y ORKS HmE Post” comment
on the British Prime
Minister’s announcement that
Empire Day will henceforth be
known as “Commonwealth
Day”:
“Here, within the cool and
comparatively objective frame-
work of an allegedly non-
political anniversary and its
ritual celebration, is encom-
passed the whole story—in all
its majesty and all its irony—
of the rise and the decline of
the British Empire.
“The very word ‘Empire’ has
been soiled and smeared these
many years past. To attempt
to preserve it in its old dignity
and honor, to cleanse it of the
sordid associations that have
been attached to it by
Socialist M.P.s, by the editors
of Left-wing weeklies, by
Indian and African politicians
avidly desirous of grasping
power—may be a ‘ task no
longer possible of accomplish-
ment. It may be expedient—
it may even, within the terms
of contemporary politics, be
right— to proclaim ‘The Empire
is dead, long live the Common-
wealth.’
“But it may be worth-while
briefly to ponder the virtues
of that which, so perfunctorily,
we commit to the grave and
oblivion. For the purposes of
the present argument, those
who chatter about the glories
of ‘our expanding Common-
wealth’ may be ignored.
“Sixty years ago the structure
of the British Empire seemed
massive and impregnable. For
a larger part of the century
which was then coming to its
end that Empire had been able
to preserve, over a great part
of the world’s surface, a peace
and a security such as Western
civilisation had not experienced
since the time of the Anto-
nines.
“Great nations passed from
turbulent infancy, through a
callow childhood to the verge
of maturity and made this
difficult journey unmolested
and unhampered—behind the
strong, sure shield of the
Royal Navy’s protection. The
United States, for all the
grumbling of the politicians in
Washington, owed its existence
to the tolerance and the fore-
sight of the Royal Navy. So
did Australia and New Zea-
land. Nationalist, anti-British,
anti-imperialist India grew-up
just as much (and with just as
important consequences) under
the same shield.
“The British Empire, what-
ever its merits or defects, was
the creation of the people of
these [British] islands. Perhaps
the process which thus created
London “Daily Mail"
“CONFUSE-US, HE SAY”
it may be described as ‘expan-
sionist.’ To the vast majority
of those who took part in that
process there was no hint of
the shameful or the ignoble in
what they did. They knew only
that they were establishing law
and order, and a free and un-
terrorised society, where before
there had been murder, corrup-
tion, slavery, savagery and
fear.
“They knew that they were
the peace-bringers and the
bridge-builders. They put
down thuggee, they saved child-
widows from being flung
alive into their husbands’
funeral flames, they fought
cholera, malaria and the
plague. They built the first
roads, schools and hospitals
ever known in country after
country. They fed the hungry
and protected the fatherless;
and they were bold and reso-
lute in the service of a cause
which they knew to be just and
right.
“And this was the work of
Imperialism, which the children
of the slavers and the enslaved,
and of those who until it came
had known no rule but the
rule of the jungle, were taught
to despise and deride. This was
the British Empire, of whose
name and work it is fashionable
now to be so ashamed that the
very statues of those who built
it men like Kitchener and
Gordon —must be pulled down
at night and under cover of
darkness, lest those who have
so signally benefited from
their labors be affronted. The
name of Victoria Road must be
changed to Canteenwallah
Road, because the lingering
memories of our odious
tyranny must be removed.
Such is the cant of our time.
“To agree that Empire Day
should be called Common-
wealth Day is, therefore,
merely to bow to the inevitable,
and to do it with seemliness
and courtesy; but as we go
forward into the new era it is
not for us to condemn those
honorable elders among us
who may feel that the bright
day is done and we are for
the dark.”
Nato
T ondon “Time and Tide”
comment on the problems
and limitations of Nato: “In
many respects the alliance is
already in a state of appalling
confusion. The most successful
field of co-operation in Nato
has been not political, but
among the military staffs. And
the soldiers are constantly
frustrated by the inability of
their political masters to decide
what sort of war is being
guarded against and on what
weapons the West should
rely.
“The main French effort is
tied-up in Algeria, and the
refusal of her allies to admit
that she is defending their
southern flank has long been
a cause of bitter ill-feeling in
France. General de Gaulle
is now making a bid for greater
power in the alliance and he
has strong cards to play, which
were not available to his
predecessors, who were so
precariously in office. There
are still no rocket-bases being
constructed in France, but
without them the whole theory
of land-based rocket defence
is perhaps mortally damaged.
And de Gaulle is in no mood
for concessions.
“The Germans —for good or
ill—have still not raised any-
thing like the promised, and
needed, army. The Scandi-
navian countries are always
pressing against any involve-
ment in the Mediterranean.
The Dutch are talking about
the few days their Army was
able to hold out against the
Nazis and the futility of
expensive preparations for a.
battle which next time might
last only a few hours.
“The core of the alliance is
the presence of American
troops in Europe, and little by
little the Americans are learn-
ing the difficulties and respon-
sibilities which their position
entails.
“Nor is Britain by any means
blameless. Militarily, we have,
for apparently selfish reasons,
made unilateral reductions in
our contribution contrary to
the clearly expressed views of
the Nato commander. Politi-
cally, we seem dangerously
ready to use the implied threat
of withdrawal as a bargaining
counter. Economically, our

Common Market countries,
perhaps unjustly, to accuse
Britain of again trying to bully
her way into an advantage
while giving nothing in return,

for the common safety, to pre-
vail over the immediate
interests of any one country,
This is an inherent danger in a
democracy: that if one party
recommends an unpopular but
ultimately wise policy, the
other is sorely tempted to
advance the more popular
policy and risk the con-
sequences. .
“Nato exists because in all
the member-countries there is
a measure of bi-partisan sup-
port for it, but there is also a
constant political instability
which our enemies know very
well how to exploit. One day
the übiquitously insulted
Yankee might really go home:
the periphery of the 3.lli<incc
might crumble into fragments:
and even if there were no
invasion with tanks and guns,
other European countries might
find themselves jumping to the
Russian command as Finland
does today.
“It is perfectly true that
Nato has no ground-forces
which could hope to stem a
Russian attack. It is perfectly
true that the Russians are
beginning to outclass us omin-
ously at sea. It is perfectly
true that Western policy with
regard to conventional forces
and the nuclear deterrent
seems poised on a terrifying
dilemma. All these things are
true: but the moral is not
that we should give up trying
to fortify our bulwarks but
rather that we should try
harder. And far beyond that
is a deeper moral: Nato, how-
ever strong or weak in fire-
power, is the pin which holds
the West together. The
common effort is what counts.
“But if Nato, in its present
form, were much more power-
ful and effective than it is, it
would still not be enough. You
cannot stem a world-wide
assault by defending a single
arc of front. You cannot
counter an enemy who thinks
globally by putting your own
planning into boxes of one
continent at a time. The very
success of Nato in constructing
a shield across Europe has
spurred the Communists to
thrust round our flanks, in the
Middle East, in Asia, in Africa,
Q ur success in erecting a mili-
tary deterrent has left us
dangerously vulnerable to the
political attack which comes in
under our guard. And in its
attitude to these great perils the
West is very far from

United Nations
■Reviewing the 13th session
of the U.N. General
Assembly, which “ended in a
mood of considerable frustra-
tion,” New York “Herald
Tribune” comments that the
assembly has “apparently con-
tributed little to the solution
of the specific questions that
agitated the peoples of the
world” :
“Though its members, for
example, spoke out boldly and
voted strong condemnation of
the Communist executions of
Imre Nagy and other Hun-
garian patriots, Nagy could
not be restored to life nor
Hungary to freedom. Yet it
would be a mistake to regard
the session as unfruitful, for
while the cold war endures,
with its continuing contest for
the minds of men, the words
and acts of the world’s legisla-
tive body have an importance
far beyond the practical effects
of its resolutions.
“What was said about
Hungary ; what was said about
suspending nuclear tests ; what
was demanded in the way of
free elections for a unified
Korea may not influence
Soviet or Red Chinese policy
in those situations. The
opposition of the Communist
bloc to all the General
Assembly’s decisions on such
subjects will undoubtedly be
reflected by stubborn defiance.
But the formal voice of the
world’s conscience in each
case, raised for international
justice, will certainly have an
impact upon peoples who have
been exposed to the flood of
Red propaganda. The Soviet
Union and its satellites have
been worsted in debate, their
crimes have been exposed in
public forum. They stand
condemned in inescapable
fashion.
“Apart from particular
issues, the 13th session of the
General Assembly saw the
continuation of a trend that
has been marked through the
UiN.’s life —the rise of the
new nationalities. The
assembly took official cognis-
ance of the fact that Nigeria,
the British and French
Cameroons, Italian Somali-
land and French Togoland
would become independent in
1960. Guinea —over French
protests that the precise form
and affiliations of this newly
sovereign territory were not
yet clear —was recommended
for membership in the U.N.
by the Security Council during
the last days of the session.
“This trend poses new
responsibilities and opportuni-
ties for the U.N. —as well as
new difficulties. The latter
were demonstrated by the
debate on Algeria, in which
the assembly was asked (but
rightly refused) to take action
on a matter which is for the


French community of nations
to decide.
“On the positive side, the
General Assembly took steps to
aid the underdeveloped nations
which are taking their places
in the councils of the world.
It voted a special fund for
their assistance, for example,
and set up an extremely im-
portant programme whereby a
pool of trained administrators
might be created from which
the new countries could draw
experienced personnel.
“Thus, while the activities of
the 13th session were not spec-
tacular, they marked progress.
Red offences against freedom
were condemned and practical
measures taken to assist coun-
tries which are just attaining
freedom. The U.N. remains
an invaluable agency for ad-
vancing the rule of law.”
On the same subject, Lon-
don “Economist” adds that
“it is not the quietness of the
1958 assembly that calls for
complaint ; the quietness itself
has been heartening. The
growing allergy to protracted
vituperation is a symptom of
maturity, and has helped an
82 - member body to get
through its agenda in no more
time than the original assembly
of only 50-odd delegations
used to neecf
“Yet one should not get
too complacent when the de-
bates on Cyprus and Algeria
end with whimpers instead of
bangs, when Indonesia does
not raise the New Guinea issue
at all, when the assembly con-
ducts a hushed burial-service
over the remains of the
summer’s Middle Eastern crisis
and refuses to get worked-up
about Quemoy. The decline
in polemics has not been fol-
lowed by any fresh zeal for
action.
“The U.N. has left the
cauldron of territorial-water
disputes to bubble on until
1960. It has refused to solve
the South-west Africa problem
by partition, but has turned up
no better idea. Disarmament
has been relegated in despair
to a ‘committee of the whole.’
The new special development
fund has been launched, but
only $lB million has been
pledged as yet; the Com-
munist Governments and other
loud champions of develop-
ment aid are conspicuous
among the laggards. Having
got into a fine tangle over
U.N. publicity, the assembly
has extricated itself by telling
Mr. Hammarskjold, in effect,
to do what he thinks best. And
it has only too readily dropped
the hot-potato question of
future U.N. forces. Nobody
in authority has yet made the
obvious point that such a force
might one day have a part to
play in Germany.
“Three months of costly
activity have, in fact, achieved
precious little. Those delegates
who want the U.N. to thrive
should now at least be think-
ing how to use any future
ILLINGWORTH, IN LONDON “DAILY MAIL ”
‘quiet’ assemblies to press re-
forms of the .organisation’s
own mechanisms. One worth-
while first step would be to
end the absurd system of 82
delegations in committee
adopting, by simple majority,
resolutions which the same 82
often fail to pass by the neces-
sary two-thirds majority in
plenary session. This merely
confuses the public and makes
the assembly look silly—
which it can ill afford to do.”
Nasser and
Communism
A rab criticisms of Com-
munism—and particularly
Nasser’s linking of Western
imperialism, Zionism and
Communism as enemies of
Arab nationalism —has sparked-
off a fresh run of British press-
comment on the pros and cons
of “making friends” with the
Egyptian dictator. Thus
London “News Chronicle,” on
the subject of Britain and
Egypt coming to terms,
suggests that “politically and
economically this has got to
happen sometime, and the
sooner the better”:
“So long as we [Britain] do
nothing, Moscow tightens the
cotton noose around Nasser’s
throat. Either we sit and enjoy
the strangulation or we rescue
the victim for his sake—and
ours.”
“Manchester Guardian,”
while noting that “there is no
reason, why, in liking the Com-
munists less, President Nasser
should like the Western Powers
more” adds, however, that
“now that the West is weak in
the Arab world and Soviet
influence is increasing, there
are indications that Left-wing
deviationism is an infantile
disorder that Arab nationalism
may at last be beginning to
grow out of.”
London “Daily Telegraph,”
however, is less optimistic,
particularly about “people in
the. West who are likely to
draw misleading conclusions
from Nasser’s denunciation of
Arab Communists”:
“On the anniversary of the
Port Said withdrawal, an
occasion dedicated to black-
guarding and crowing over the
British, French and Israelis, he
has coupled with them the
Communists as enemies of
Arab nationalism. This is
indeed profoundly significant.
For the first time the Arabs
have been warned, by their
own self-appointed leader, of
the danger within. Nasser has
done in a single broadcast more
than' the long efforts of
Western diplomacy and pro-
paganda can hope to have
achieved.
“The ‘let’s - make - friends -
with-Nasser’ school of thought
is certain to be strengthened
by his belated acknowledgment
that our enemies are also his.
That, no doubt, was one of
his purposes in denouncing
them. We should welcome his
words without illusions about
the character and power of the
man who, it is being suggested,
could now become our col-
laborator in combating the
spread of Communism in the
Middle East. Could Nasser,
even if he wished, work with
us in this way? And if he did,
how strong a bulwark would
he be?
“The answer to the first
question is self-evident. His
Soviet fetters apart, Nasser
could never make political
common cause with the West.
The whole dizzy structure of
his prestige in the Arab world
is founded on his leadership
against ‘Western imperialism.’
The moment when his enemies
could accuse him of coming
to terms with it would be the
beginning of his decline. How
can we build up as a bulwark
of stability in the Middle East
a man who is working against
us in Aden, the Persian Gulf
and Africa? How can Nasser
stop doing so without losing
the prestige on which he lives?
‘ Moreover, side by side with
his denunciation of Com-
munists in the Arab world is
to be set his new linking of the
Egyptian economy to the Com-
munist world. Some may
think this is just the old prin-
ciple of ‘spoiling the Egyp-
tians’ in reverse. We have no
objection to improving the lot
of his destitute subjects from
any source. But these arrange-
ments cannot make him less
inclined to despoil us if he can.
“As to his strength, whether
for good or mischief, it may
already be on the wane. It
grew by easy and spectacular
successes, but since this summer
Nasser has suffered a series of
reverses in Jordan, Lebanon
and Iraq, and now in
the Syrian subversion. The
initiative has slipped from his
hands. That it has been seized
by the Communists poses new
problems for Western policy.
But it is an illusion to suppose

Ruffi in ike
Co-ordination of transport is one of Australia’s
most pressing needs.
Along with the extension of power for industry,
it ranks as one of the chief basic necessities in our
getting to grips with the twin problems of higher
production and lower costs.
This conclusion has been sharpened by my
observation overseas. While my travels abroad
have strengthened my faith in Australia’s future,
they have also confirmed my belief that we are
entering into a more competitive world, in which
the story of our future success will start with one
word: Efficiency.
Transport is a first key to that.
Approaches to this subject usually deal with
partial views of it, such as losses on the railways,
the inadequacy of our roads, the decline of coastal
shipping in a country that is so largely maritime.
There have been occasional signs of forward
and original thinking: as in the proposal by
shipping lines to introduce vessels built specially to
carry loaded trucks, which could be driven on and
off at any port.
That is good. It is positive. But again, any
result from it would be to provide only a
partial solution.
The handling of our national transport problem
as a whole, is still awaiting the statesman’s touch.
While this is delayed, the calls on existing
systems become heavier, and the difficulties of
straightening out the economic tangle become
costlier and more involved.
The division of powers as between Common-
wealth and States, the public ownership of
railways as against the use of roads by private
enterprise —these and other factors in the complex
question are admitted.
But ' sixty years have passed since the
nation-minded framers of our Federation were able
to make an instrument for Australian living that
covered much more than is contained in this one
aspect of our growth and movement.
And I believe that, given the courage and
will to achieve it, the co-ordination of Australia’s
transport is well within our powers of
self-conferment today.

that these could be solved by
trying to cast Nasser in the
role of a Middle Eastern Tito.
He is as much the prisoner of
his own anti-Westernism as of
his Soviet armorers.”
Russia and the
Antarctic
/Commenting on the Soviet’s
moves to establish itself
in the Antarctic, London
“Time and Tide” points out
that “Since the end of World
War II the West has developed
a fire-brigade mentality, dash-
ing to meet the emergency
wherever Russia may have
chosen to create it; meanwhile
the Soviet Union quietly
pursues her course towards
certain long-term objectives
irrespective of current crises”:
“She is now developing her
position in the Antarctic, where
for many months America has
Munich “Simplicissinnus”

ATOMIC CLOCK
been trying to secure some
form of international agree-
ment. In May, President Eisen-
hower proposed a treaty
between the countries directly
concerned, hoping to freeze the
legal status of the continent,
and thus forestall conflicting
territorial claims based on the
activities of the present
scientific expeditions.
“So far no agreement has
been reached. Russia has pro-
posed an international con-
ference of all nations, an idea
which does not appeal to Aus-
tralia, where opinion is solidly
against the introduction of out-
side interests. In the mean-
time Moscow has reserved all
rights in the Antarctic ‘based
on discoveries and exploration
of Russian sailors and scientists
at the beginning of the nine-
teenth century.’ She has also
implied that the work of
Bellinghausen made all sub-
sequent explorers in the
Grahamland area trespassers
on ‘Soviet’ Antarctic territory.
“Australia is becoming in-
creasingly uneasy about the
permanence of the Soviet
Union at this strategic cross-
roads in the Southern Hemi-
sphere. By the end of 1959 she
will have established two new
Antarctic stations, one on the
Bellinghausen Sea and the
other in the area claimed by
Norway known as Queen
Maud Land. Thus Moscow
will have achieved one of her
main objectives—the establish-
ment of Antarctic bases on
three oceans —Indian, Atlantic
and Pacific.
“Russia enthusiastically em-
braces all international scien-
tific enterprises, since so many
of them, like those launched
during the International Geo-
physical Year, fulfil her
strategic interests. Her partici-
pation in Antarctic exploration
gave her a legitimate excuse to
set foot on Antarctica.
“In 1961-62 the greatest
oceanographic research - pro-
gramme yet planned is to be
launched on the Indian Ocean.
It is organised by the Inter-
national Council of Scientific
Unions, and 16 ships from 11
countries will take part. Soviet
and American scientists have
already begun work in this
area. Russia has always had
an idee fixe about the Indian
Ocean, the hub of the British
Commonwealth, and her geo-
politicians have pinpointed the
domination of the Indian
Ocean as a necessary step
towards the outflanking of
American transoceanic de-
fences. Wherever possible
Russia is widening any exist-
ing breaches and encouraging
Communist influence along the
shores of the Indian Ocean.
“Soviet strategic interests are
also being promoted in the
Arctic. The Russian fleet
manoeuvres provide an excuse
for closing the Arctic region
while atomic missiles are being
tested. The missiles are
launched from Tadzhikistan,
and they land within a defined
area. These tests are of great
importance for future trans-
polar warfare.”


Cox’s Paddock, Cullenbone,
Slasher’s Flat, Beau Deair,
Biraganbil, Guntawang, Spring-
field, Magpie, Three Mile,
Yamble, Beryl and Stringy-
bark, and others with names
I can’t recall.
I have mentioned these
names to give some idea of
the size of the field. All ran
into Black Lead, which was a
river of gold. Of the sub-
sidiary leads, Happy Valley
was the richest.
So far I have relied entirely
on memory for these notes,
but they are close to the facts.
A few official figures, from an
article published in the
“Mudgee Guardian” in 1954,
will not be out of place. Happy
Valley, No. 4 claim, cleaned-up
27450 z. for 179 loads of wash-
dirt, averaging per load.
(A load would be about three-
quarters of a ton.) This was
on October 4, 1871. The area
of payable washdirt along
Happy Valley is approximately
680 acres, with an average
thickness of 15in. The yield
from this field proves it to be
the richest lead ever opened in
N.S.W. The average yield over
the entire area was 40z., sgrns.
One nugget of 90oz. and one of
60 were found. Six men, work-
ing one claim, earned in 40
days £1741 per man, at
£3 16s. 3d. per ounce ; Sep-
tember 28, 1871. The depth
of sinking ranged from 35ft.
near its head to 115 ft. near the
Black Lead. These are but a
few of the official figures ; they
can be checked at the Mines
Department.
"Dlack Lead was even richer,
and much greater in area,
being three miles long and
half-a-mile wide. When the
rush started there were a lot
of arguments, sometimes
developing into fights, over
overlapping of claims. A two-
man claim was 100 ft. square.
T. A. Browne (“Rolfe Boldre-
wood,” of Robbery Under
Arms) was the gold-commis-
sioner at the time. He called
a meeting of the diggers, and
worked-out a system of
pegging which the majority
agreed was' fair. The area
was surveyed in blocks,
100 ft. each way, and numbered.
Each digger got the claim with
the number corresponding with
the one on his application-
form. (Every man had to have
a miner’s right, and apply
for permission, before he was
allowed to dig.)
This method of adjusting the
layout of a goldfield cut out
a lot of abuses. Some men
would apply for six men’s
ground, and then work it with
two. Others would take-up
several claims and “shepherd”
them—that is, do no work on
them until they were sure which
way the lead was running—
or else sell them to others who
had been late and found no
vacant ground to peg. Browne
made sure that each man got
only the ground he was entitled
to, and each claim had to be
worked fully. If he was of the
opinion that a claim was being
“shepherded” it was declared
vacant, and was given to the
applicant whose number had
just missed in the first draw.
Browne dealt severely with
the lawless element that flocked
to Gulgong. Quite a few
Americans wore revolvers
strapped to their belts, but
these were quickly confiscated,
and their owners were warned
not to offend again. Many of
the “furriners” and “Roo-
shians” carried knives, but
never for very long. Mounted-
troopers were patrolling the
tent-town and the field night
and day. So Gulgong, despite
its 30,000 people and its vast
amount of gold, was practically
free from crime.
ulgong’s golden glory has
faded into the past, and
today there is little to show
that it had been a famous gold-
field. Holes have been filled-
in, mullock-heaps levelled-off,
and crops are being grown
where the diggers toiled. It is
a small town, but the district
is extremely wealthy. Wheat
and wool are showing that the
topsoil is more profitable than
washdirt in the long-run. Even
the Black Lead shows only an
isolated mullock-heap here and
there as a reminder of the
“roaring days.”
When the town was built,
and the streets formed, all the
material came from the
mullock-heaps, so Gulgong is
literally paved with gold.
Many “newchum” miners did
not know the washdirt when
they came to it, so they hauled
it to the top and dumped it on
the heaps with the mullock.
After every good rainstorm
most of the citizens would be
in the streets “specking,” and
it was sometimes a very profit-
able pastime. Nuggets up to
6oz. and many nice slugs found
their way into the pockets of
people who had never sunk
a hole in their lives. When the
streets were tar-sealed this
industry ceased.
On the workings, fossicking
and specking are still con-
sidered a pleasant way of
spending a Sunday afternoon.
Families will pack a basket
of food, and spend a happy
day rambling around a lead,
with eyes on the ground. If
a few specks are found they
are proudly exhibited for
weeks afterward. And it is
seldom the sharp-eyed kids fail
to find something to bring
home.
No reefs, worth while, were
ever found on the Gulgong
field ; though many were tried,
they all petered-out at shallow
depths. Copper, silver and
antimony showed promise on
several shows, but none lasted.
Kaolin and pipeclay are still
being worked in several places.
gold-diggers, including
myself, are alike in one
respect: all know of places
where there “must be gold.”
Ned Saunders and Bill Good-
man were first-class samples of
this type. When we asked if
they could lay us on to a likely
spot, as we were young, strong
and burning with gold-fever,
we were an answer to their
prayers.
They took us out to Log
Paddock in a springcart
loaded with - mining-gear —•
picks, shovels* dishes, windlass,
ropes, bucket, hammer, drills
and gympies. We also had two
tents, cooking utensils, bunks
and plenty of straw for our
beds.
At Home Rule we pulled-up
for a drink ; rum for the old
chaps, light shandies for us.
Both reckoned we were softies
when we knocked back the
rum. They took theirs straight.
We saw the remains of an
old fire-engine, nearly hidden
with weeds and grass, marked
a.d. 1806. Bill said it had
been brought up on a bullock-
wagon when Gulgong was still
a tent-town.
Home Rule had been the
most densely populated part of
the field in the early days.
(Today there is little left of it,
but it is still well known
because of its kaolin deposits,
which are said to be among
the world’s greatest and of a
very high quality. About 30
men are employed in the pits
all the year.).
Log Paddock, three miles on,
had been a huge lead. Henry
Lawson’s father had worked
here, and it was from the old
diggers who had stayed after
the lead was worked-out that
Henry got most of his mining
stories. The Lawson home was
in good order, and occupied.
(Only the chimney and one
post are standing now, though
a memorial is nicely laid-out
on the site.)
HThe selection of the position
to sink the hole led to ai
lot of controversy between Ned
#nd Bill. Both got very
DRY STORM
The uninhabited, mountains stand up green,
naked with rock or clothed with an old forest,
where vines and thorns tangle in damp and dark
among tree-trunks and boulders. Curls of fern
and coils of water over leaves and rock
pattern the snake’s long body, hide from harm
moth, bird and lizard. From those ancient turrets
twilight thrusts up the cloud of this dry storm.
Spring’s months are thirsty. The valley’s crops are sown
and the seed waits. But nothing comes tonight
except the thrusts of lightning. There is sound,
but it is thunder circling, here and gone,
and not the increasing rain. Long since it rained,
and now the grass is dry, ready to burn,
and farmers fear the lightning. The cloud’s heart
is torn wide open, but it .means no rain.
O ease our restlessness. Wild wandering dark,
vague hurrying depths of storm, pause and be full,
and thrust your fullness into our desire
till time release us; till we sleep. And wake
to a cool sky and a soaked earth left bare
to drink its light in peace.
But this storm’s dry,
and dries us with its passion, and means ill,
reared from dark forests to a darker sky.

heated; Ned called Bill “A
bloody old fool! ” and Bill said,
“A man orter knock yer bloody
block off!”
As both were in their
seventies we used a bit of
diplomacy, and calmed them
down. We pointed out that it
was only a matter of a few feet,
and we suggested that they
split the difference, which they
did. I am pretty sure there
would have been a few punches
swung had we not interfered.
Both were tough old blokes,
and must have been mighty
men in their younger days. So,
good mates again, they squatted
on their haunches, and with
twigs sketched in the dust the
layout of Log Paddock.
They showed where the lead
had swung, but the diggers
had kept in a straight line, and
missed the main run of gold.
As they had worked on the
lead we conceded that they
could be right. Another dust-
map was traced showing the
various strata we should go
through, and the depth was
estimated at 80ft.
With visions of nuggets as
big as the Welcome Stranger
we started to “put her down,”
grudging the time we wasted in
sleep.
Our two mates came out
twice a week with sharp picks
and supplies, which they
insisted on paying for. Ned
said: “You boys are doing the
work, so we’ll look after the
expenses.” They paid for our
miner’s rights and registering
of the claim in our four names.
Dutchy suggested that the
claim be named the Here's
Luck, and this was adopted.
As we went down we struck
hard seams, which had to
be shot with explosives. Bill
and Ned showed us how to
drill holes, load and fire them,
After one lesson I reckoned
I could manage the shooting,
so when we came onto hard
stuff again at 50ft. I drilled
six holes 12in. deep, crimped
the detonators (diggers called
them caps) on the fuses, pushed
them into the half-plugs of
gelignite, slid them gently into
the holes and tamped them
down. 1 then tied the fuse-
ends together. All the fuses
had been cut to the same length
to ensure the six charges
exploding at the same time.
This was to avoid any possi-
bility of a misfire, as firing in
rotation in such a confined
space is likely to cut a fuse or
displace a charge.
I was confident and cool
till the moment came for light-
ing-up. My hands started to
shake when 1 got the matches
out, for if anything went wrong
there would be no time to get
out.
I called up to Dutchy
“Ready!” and he answered,
“Under below!”
- I put one foot in the hook,
grasped the rope in my left
hand, lit the match and bent
down and put it on the group
of fuses. It went out. 1 swore
a few times, wiped the sweat
out of my eyes, got the matches
out again and lit another. Thi>
time the fuse spluttered at once,
and I was so startled that l
stood staring for a few
seconds. Dutchy, whose nerves
were as bad as mine, yelled,
and woke me into action. He
brought me up faster than ever
before, and I sprawled over the
logging, rolled down the
mullock-heap, and sprinted for
a tree.
Dutchy was a better runner
than me as a rule, but I kept
with him that time. But we
need not have worried. Fuse
burns at the rate of 2ft. per
minute, and to be on the safe
side I had cut them 4ft. long.
It seemed a long time until
the explosion came. First a
shower of stones, then a cloud
of dust and a dull “crump.”
As we walked back to the
hole, Dutchy said, in a most
professional manner, “Sounded
like a good shot.” And I
answered, “Yes, she was a
good one.”
I have since worked as
powder-monkey in quarries
and railway-cuttings, where I
have brought out hundreds of
tons of spoil every shot, but I
never got the same thrill as I
did from those six plugs of
gelignite, my first shot.
Tt was half-an-hour before the
dust settled sufficiently for
me to go down. The fumes
were thick, but had no effect
on me, though most people
get violent headaches after
contact with them. Even
handling the plugs affects some,
and Dutchy was one of these.
After loading and firing one
set he was out of action for
the rest of the day. He swore
his skull was opening and
shutting every time he moved.
So I was appointed official
powder-monkey of the Here’s
Luck.
When we reached the
70ft.-level, and came to a
seam of basalt, Bill and
Ned camped with us,
and took charge of the
operations. They seemed
to regain their lost
youth, and insisted on
doing all the bottom
work, while we did the
winding. We passed the
80ft.-level, and excite-
ment was running high.
There were several of the left-
over men from the early days
on the field, and there would
always be a couple at the shaft,
giving advice and commenting
on our chances of getting gold,
and all comments were favor-
able.
Each one was lowered
slowly down the hole to
examine the strata. We heard
one chap remark, “Same
country as the Nil Desper-
andum,” and mentions of other
famous mines of 40 years back.
At 85ft. we broke through
the basalt, and when the smoke
and dust subsided there was
10ft. of water in the hole. By
morning it was 50ft. So that
was the end of the Here’s
Luck.
It was a shock to all of us.
Dutchy, the philosopher,
shrugged and remarked, “Just
a man’s luck,” and I, not see-
ing much sense in words,
nodded. But the two old men
took it hard. They sagged
visibly, and looked much older
than their years. We had
walked to Home Rule one
night, and got a bottle of rum
to celebrate the bottoming of
the hole.- I poured a good stiff
jolt into both of them, but I
don't think either man tasted
it. Usually rum-drinking was
a ritual, with comments such
as “That’s the stuff!” from
Bill. Ned would smack his
lips, roll his eyes, and say,
“Ah, snifter!” But rum, and
life, had lost all flavor for
them.
Goldmining is full of dis-
appointments, and the greatest
of these is to strike water in
a deep hole. And we had
found a strong stream, which
was impossible to cope with.
A duffer is bad enough, but at
least you know there is no
gold. But we will never know
what we might have missed
through not being able to
bottom the Here’s Luck. I am
still of the opinion that we
were on the right track
though, as any old digger will
tell you, “One man can see
through the ground as far
as any other.”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Political Apathy
About 10 years ago a
public-opinion poll indicated
that 47 per cent, of the then
voting public thought it no great
odds which Commonwealth
Government was in power, and
that state of thinking is
unlikely to have altered in the
interim. Politicians are still
regarded somewhat distrust-
fully; politics, viewed as a
“pretty dirty business,” finds
little scope in intelligent dis-
cussion, being tacitly barred,
along with religion and money,
as an unmentionable subject.
Possibly this indifference
has a historical basis. Our
politics from the beginning
have been largely a struggle
between pressure-groups, and
perhaps still are. There has
been inherent struggle between
importers and exporters,
between city interests and
country interests, between Pro-
tectionists and Free-traders,
and the conditions so created
have conspired to prevent the
rise of sophisticated, national
political thought. In our
industrial society, economic
interest takes precedence over
intellectual activity in politics,
the need for intellectualism
not even being conceded. The
result of this is a rather feeble
community spirit.
The absence of national feel-
ing is seen in the decay of
political thought and the
virtual disappearance of specu-
lative philosophy on a world
scale. At best, party pro-
grammes have become narrow
in scope ; at worst, promises
to articulate pressure-groups.
Another deterrent to politi-
cal maturity is the fact that
many Federal Parliamentarians
are under the control of State
executives, or feel they owe
State executives a good deal of
gratitude. Consequently the
centralised discussion of politi-
cal issues of national merit is
made difficult. Within our
political parties there are many
sectional fights, many of the
details of which are unknown
to and almost undiscoverable
by the ordinary citizen. This
lack of knowledge of issues
inevitably leads to loss of
interest. '
Again, the Federal Govern-
ment’s lack of power over
basic developmental policies is
a contributing factor. In
almost all such cases the
Federal Government must
resort to verbal persuasion or
financial inducement, being
empowered to intervene
directly only in foreign trade.
Add to this a tendency of the
Federal system to give our
political issues a legalistic
character, the isolation of
Canberra and an inadequate
“Here, Papa — here's your lunch!"
press-coverage of foreign
affairs, and the man-in-the-
street has a tough job getting
a reasonably clear picture.
There’s no easy answer to
the public’s coldness towards
politics, but we could take a
first step if political parties
adopted methods by which
policies could be nationally
determined without continuous
interference by State interests
or State executives. — Xavier

“No Speak-a da English”
“Dunrobin” (B. 5/11/ ’5B)
has something when he says,
“a sufficient knowledge of the
English language to enable an
applicant to repeat the oath
intelligently should be a mini-
mum condition [for naturalisa-
tion].”
But how many migrants have
this working knowledge of the
English language and cunningly
conceal it, making their
ignorance a definite advantage
to themselves? I have been
thrown into contact with a fair
cross-section of migrants
during the recent sugar-season,
and am fully convinced that
“No da English!” is a
shrewd defence against un-
welcome chores, dirty jobs and
any unpleasant situation.
In one case a crew of three
manned a tramline feeding a
weighbridge. John and Joe
(Australians), pulled the rope,
crawled under trucks, un-
coupled them and generally did
the pig- work. Karl (did he
remember Vienna?) drove the
electric winch because he “no
unnerstand count trucks.”
We get it right through
“No unnerstand,” “No speak.”
But let the merest whisper of
a rumor of a suggestion
of overtime crop-up and
they’re around in droves!
Sixteen-bob an hour (and
better) speak| all languages!
Recently an Austrian was
fined at Cairns for shooting a
protected bird. He had been
eight years in Australia, and
pleaded “No understand game
laws,” despite the extensive
advertising given to those regu-
lations. A £4 fine, plus the
loss of a twenty-guinea rifle,
no doubt awakened his desire
to become conversant with the
language.
The fact that many New
Australians do understand the
language but hide behind a
useful ignorance is well illus-
trated by the following, and I
quote:
“(He) said that he wanted to
tell delegates that all migrants
knew as much about awards as
any ‘Britisher’ knows. The
migrants in Queensland had
made State Government In-
surances practically bankrupt
in compensation claims. The
figure given by these companies
four years ago was 64.7 per
cent. —98 per cent, was paid in
compensation. There would be
200 in Brisbane now with
‘crook’ backs. If you shouted
‘Fire!’ they would move in no
time. ‘You can’t tell me they
don’t know where they are
going,’ (he said).
“A number of Queensland
officials could tell delegates that
migrants know more about the
awards than the ‘Britisher,’ and
know more about ‘going
around the back door’ to break
the awards than any Britisher.
‘Why don’t they assimilate?’ he
asked. Schools had been set
up right throughout Queens-
land by the Education Depart-
ment for the tuition of migrants
in the English language, and
quite a few attended these
schools, but the majority of
them congregated in their own
clubs, and made no attempt to
attend the schools and learn the
language.”
Who is the “he” who is
speaking? None other than
Mr. Joe Bukowski, speaking at
the 72nd annual convention of
the Australian Workers’ Union
in Sydney on January 22, 1958.
And if they’ve got Premier-
buster Joe bluffed, it’s time for
someone to take real and
positive action. —27 Pommy

TV
TV-executives who believe
they must subsidise ,current
periodicals which print original
fiction to obtain new material
for their own purposes (B.
3/12/’58) must still be as
“green” as their business.
Actually, there never has
been the slightest lack of
source-material for any his-
trionic form or medium since
the invention of printing some
500-odd years ago. It’s simply
a matter of contemporary
writers mastering the adapta-
tion in original style of both old
and new material to the latest
innovation of form, and this
always follows in due course
and comparatively soon, given
the necessary inducement.
What TV-executives are
currently up against is their
own failure to realise that they
must offer rewards to writers
competitive with and equiva-
lent to those advanced by their
nearest rivals —leading periodi-
cals and film-producers. In the

end, a regular flow of source-
material, new in form however
old in theme, must be available
to any immature medium of
education or entertainment
(such as TV at present) if that
medium is to progress steadily
to its ultimate fulfilment. This
is secured only by encouraging
creative minds by payment at
rates in corresponding ratio to
the income-earning mean or
capacity of the medium. In
TV, this is high.
In short, TV must, and even-
tually will, develop its own
individual source of material
instead of half-heartedly con-
verting for the “little screen”
material expressly produced
for and better suited to the
cinema-screen, radio and stage.

Bread
In the Victorian Wimmera,
where 40 per cent, of the State’s
considerable wheat-yield is
produced, a 41b. loaf of bread
now costs 3s. Id. over the
counter. Yet residents in outer-
Melbourne suburbs get their
bread, even after the. wheat for
it has been carted, rail-
freighted, milled and baked,
delivered for fivepence less.
So do people just across the
border in Mt. Gambier, where
wheat is by no means a staple
product.
To the wheatfarmer, who
bears the cost of growing,
harvesting, carting and railing
the wheat, and also that of
travelling miles to buy his
bread in town, this is a most
topsy-turvy state of affairs.—

Unions as Agencies
Workers who resent com-
pulsory unionism, and unions
which see in it the only means
whereby those who gain from
the unions’ efforts may be
permitted—or forced —to con-
tribute their share towards the
costs, should be equally
interested in a Canadian
experiment.
it's known as “Agency Shop”
as distinct from “Union Shop” ;
and it simply means that those
workers whose wages and
conditions are covered by
union-won awards, but who
don’t want to belong to a
union, may pay a sum equiva-
lent to their union-fees into an
“agency”—which would be the
appropriate union. By this
means the union is compen-
sated for the expenses involved
in fighting for better con-
ditions for its members and
for those other workers under
the same awards.
That puts the worker in the
clear. He’s paying for the
union’s services, but he’s free
from the domination of cliques.
He can’t be expelled and thus
denied the right to earn his
living at his trade, and he
can’t be levied for political
purposes or in any way victim-
ised or intimidated because of
his own political beliefs.
The union should be equally
pleased, because it would then
consist only of willing members
“You re no bird-of-paradise yourself !”
who could be expected to take
an interest in union affairs, if
by any chance the union saw
some advantage in increasing
its membership it could attract
the “agency-payers” by amend-
ing its rules to remove the
possibility of victimisation or
compulsory levies or other
objectionable practices.
Pieter Nuyts (W.A.).
Brave New Cities
During the last war, and for
years afterwards, there was a
lot of talk (and a plethora of
press-articles) concerning the
virtues of decentralisation.
Our cities were overcrowded,
it was drummed into us, and,
in the event of a future con-
flict, the war-effort could be
paralysed by aerial attacks on
our few big centres. There
were too many eggs in half-a-
dozen baskets: the way out of
the problem would depend on
the establishment of numerous
small towns.
The suggestion was received
with enthusiasm on every
hand ; architects let their hair
down and came to light with
attractive designs for cities in
miniature. Factories —or what-
ever else people were to work
in were to be strategically
placed in the country and were
,to be surrounded by tree-filled
parks and recreation-grounds.
On the outskirts were to be
garden-flats and cottages for
the workers, just five minutes’
walk (through the parks) to and
from their work. Impressive
civic centres were visualised,
well equipped with baby-
clinics, day-nurseries, kinder-
gartens, libraries and the like.
In fact, everything in the
garden promised to be beauti-
ful.
it would be interesting to
learn how many of these
decentralised towns have
materialised. Certainly, there
is Elizabeth, in South Aus-
tralia, but it is so close to
Adelaide that if ever bombs
were to rain down on that city
Elizabeth might also expect to
collect some.
In N.S.W. there appears to
be precious little effort made
to encourage decentralisation.
Wollongong and Port Kembla
(the two towns are now prac-
tically one) continue to grow
rapidly, while, in Sydney,
traffic confusion becomes daily
more confounded as huge
blocks of concrete-aluminium-
glass rise in profusion. A new
giant, rising 370 ft., is soon to
be erected: no doubt it won’t
be long before it will have
mates of like stature. I’ve
nothing against tall buildings
as such, but it cannot be
claimed that they are condu-
cive to population-dispersion,
and, should atomic or hydro-
gen bombs ever fall on Sydney,
then Heaven help u's all.
But even if we put on our
rose-colored glasses and pooh-
pooh the undesirable pessi-
mistic chatter concerning
bombs, we’d still have to be
pretty blind to ignore the
traffic-problems into which
we're bumping all the time.
It’s comforting to be assured
that the 370ft. building isn't
going to upset our normal
traffic one little bit. Evidently
those who are to occupy these
heaven-soaring offices will have
no homes to go to.
It’s pleasant news that Mc-
Mahon’s Point (just across the
north side of the Harbor) is
to remain a residential area
and is not to be devoted to
factories as was at first in-
tended. Instead it's to be
covered with blocks of flats
(one will have 23 stories),
which, so far as I’m able to
judge from the architects’
pictures, should prove highly
effective if) keeping sunlight
and air from each other.
Already, in Kirribilli, one sky-
scraping flat-building is ade-
quately robbing dozens of
lower-levelled homes of their
rightful measure of sunshine.
Flats may be the answer to
the housing problems of many,
though, from my observations
in British and European cities,


I’ve concluded it’s nothing less
than cruelty to children when
they’re forced to live in these
crowded, closed-in dwellings.
Boys and girls need a garden,
or a backyard or paddocks to
play and expand in. Or per-
haps it’s time we gave away
that traditional picture of
the cornstalking, bushwhacking
Australian and produced one
of a more robotlike nature in
keeping with our flat-build-
ings, our outsized office-blocks
and our traffic snarls.
Whether or not N.S.W. has
a motto, I haven’t a clue. If
not, it might be an idea to
adopt a suitable one along the
lines of “Centralise and/or
Bust.” — Maitri (N.S.W.).
Smoking and Cancer
Thanks to “Miilicent” (B.
24/12/’58) for sending me to
the Commonwealth Year Book
—in my case the 1956 edition,
which carries the figures in-
formatively up to 1954, or
three years later than the ones
quoted by “M.” if we are to
accept the “significance of cold
figures” we may find them dis-
turbing.
They show that the total of
Australians dying from cancer
(the term used is “malignant
neoplasms and neoplasms of
lymphatic and haematopoietic
tissues,” which presumably
covers all varieties of what
we describe broadly as “can-
cer”) has risen to 11,611 —and
that the total in the respiratory
system in 1954 was 1229, or
an increase (in a larger popula-
tion, of course) of 247, or
about 25 per cent.
At the same time the deaths
from hypertension (blood-
pressure), associated or not
associated with heart - trouble,
numbered 4682 for 1954. This
is mentioned, not to suggest
that all were due to smoking,
but because even those medicos
who doubt the evidence on
cancer are mostly agreed that
smoking can lead to blood-
pressure and heart-disease,
If the “normal life-span” is
taken, at 70 years, then it is
seldom reached in those coun-
tries which have a majority
of the world’s population, and
in which high birthrates are
matched by high (but mostly
now decreasing) deathrates.
But in the “civilised” countries
where hygiene and medical
and disease-preventive services
are good and improving, more
people are living to greater
ages, and the average life-span
may soon exceed the Biblical
70 years. I agree that this can
mean a greater number of can-
cer cases, since cancer is mostly
a disease of later life, but I
feel that there has, as yet,
been insufficient time to assess
in those countries the effects
on health of the wave of
cigarette popularity which
began in World War I and
caught up vast numbers of
women in World War II. I
agree, too, that many factors
have to be assessed in deter-
mining the extent to which
smoking causes lung-cancer —
and also heart - trouble and
coronary occlusions.
I’m no crusader against
smoking as such, or against
other pleasant habits which
cause deterioration of health
in some people.
What 1 do urge is some cam-
paign to let young people know
what the risks are if they
smoke, in addition to the loss
of good money in smoke over
the years. If in a spirit of
bravado they decide to be
“grown up” and defy the risks,
then they can have little com-
plaint if they suffer later. They
should .be persuaded in some
way that it’s smart and adult
not to smoke. — Well-Cured

ment,” I believe, because the
prime basis of the claim is

sovereignty over the whole, of
the former Netherlands East
Indies, which, of course,
included West New Guinea,
There was a reservation placed
by the Dutch on the transfer
of that area, and the dispute
is largely over the legal mean-
ing of that reservation and
the failure of negotiations in
the early stages.
On the “ethnic and cultural”
side, the obvious answer is
that the New Guinea people
have at least far closer blood-
and color-relationship with
Indonesians, than they have
with the European Dutch com-
ing from 3000 miles away,
For centuries people have been
travelling between the 3000
islands of the archipelago, and
“Surely there must be SOME Way We can hush it up!”
the Moluccans especially have
close blood-links with New
Guinea. This doesn’t mean
that they can’t be Indonesians,
any more than the mixture of
Dutch, French, Spanish and
other blood with Anglo-Saxon
was an impediment to the de-
velopment of a British race.
Neither does it mean that the
mixture of races in Holland
itself should not all be regarded
as Dutch, or that the current
mixture of many European
bloods in Australia is not now
part of the Australian race.
Cultural ties also are fairly
close between New Guinea
and Indonesia, although they
have had scant chance to
develop. The claim that the
primitive tribesmen of West
New Guinea would do better
under Dutch rule than Indo-
nesian is debatable. After all,
the Dutch have controlled that
area for nearly four centuries,
and if the tribesmen are still
primitive it doesn’t say much
for the Hollanders. The Indo-
nesian claim is partly based on
the demonstrable fact that until
the last few years the Nether-
lands took no interest what-
ever in the welfare of the
native people of West New
Guinea. In N.E.I. days the
area was merely a convenient
penal settlement for Indo-
nesians who demonstrated too
strongly in support of eventual
independence,
As for the suggestion that
Australia should succeed the
Dutch in control of West New
Guinea, there are strong
objections. First of all, we
would merely inherit the
unpleasant argument between
Holland and Indonesia, with
all the resentment throughout
Asia on the subject, expressed
in what is now the dirty word
of “colonialism.” Secondly, if
we have any money to spare,
surely it would be better to
divert it to our major task of
really developing our own end
of New Guinea.
Surely a better solution to
this nagging business is a com-
bination of Australian, Dutch
(and American?) capital and
skill with Indonesian man-
power in the development of
West New Guinea. The pre-
requisite, it seems, would be
the ceding of sovereignty to
Indonesia. If this were done,
then the co-operation for the
development of the whole of
Indonesia should be feasible.
It would be welcomed both
by the United States and
Britain, who at last are taking
a real interest in the republic,
and thus setting us an example.
It might also permit co-opera-
tion in non-aggression defence
measures which could provide
some real protection for Aus-
tralia. Charles Meeking
(N.S.W.)
A Banker Astray
It seems odd that the
governor of the Common-
wealth Bank, Dr. Coombs,
should criticise the design and
appointments of Australian
motor-cars on the ground that
they represent an extravagant
form of transportation, and yet
wholeheartedly support the
building of an opera-house in
Sydney at a time when TV is
fast changing the entertain-
ment habits of the people.
The day before Dr. Coombs
made his criticism, the chair-
man of the A.8.C., Sir Richard
Boyer, admitted that TV had
reduced the audiences for
symphony- concerts. As the
A.B.C. is expected to be the
only large user of the opera'
house, what may we expect in,
say, five years’ time?
There is ample evidence in
the financial plight of the great
Covent Garden opera-house
in London that opera, which
could never claim to have
other than a minority appeal,
will involve the N.SAV.
Government in a heavy annual
subsidy if Mr. Cahill’s scheme
to build an opera-house in
Sydney comes to fruition.
There is no such evidence that
so-called luxury motor-cars,
whether of Australian or over-
seas design, are beyond the
financial capacity of the Aus-
tralian people.
And does Mr. Cahill, the
Treasurer who is chronically
short of funds, really believe
it is a good thing to divert
money from such necessities as
hospitals, schools, water- and
sewerage-schemes and roads,
to the building of an opera-
house which bids fair to be a
white elephant from the day
it is opened? Even the news-
paper columnists who hailed
the opera-house proposal as a
stroke of cultural genius a
couple of years ago are now
uttering grim warnings about
its financial future. —Dix

W.A. Road Boards
With the Westralian Road
Board for which I worked for
.15 years, ratepayers used to sit
around the board-room during
meetings (B. 5/11 /’5B). The
board often wondered about
the legality of their presence,
but the Local Government
Department advised that, while
the board could order them
out. they could also be
tolerated (except when the
board went into committee).
So over the years there were
one or two regulars who sat
quietly at the back of the
room and listened to the
debates. Often, too, an
interested party (say, a rate-
payer whose building-permit
was in doubt) would be there
to listen to the building-sur-
veyor’s report —and to discover
from the debate who were his
friends.
The effect of the ratepayer's
presence was amazing. Fire-
brand members who had pre-
viously denounced the contro-
versial building - application
with fiery eloquence (and
privately told the applicant
that “the board” was against
it) meekly held up their hands
when someone moved that the
permit be granted.
1 can't agree with “G.S.” that
secretaries were slipshod with
the minutes. Those I knew
took careful notes during the
meetings, being very sure to
record important motions
correctly, or had a sten-
ographer present to take down

SCIENCE IN THE COWSHED
The Art and Science of Rubber-manufacture
By W. G. WHITTLESTONE
IN this second series of articles
for the man on the land
1 want to discuss the ways in
which science helps the farmer
working in his cowshed. We
have talked about the problems
of milking and the physiology
of the cow. These are very
important things; so is the
structure of the milking-
machine and how it is
managed. But w'e will find
that often these things are
dependent on some other
branch of science.
You may well ask: what
on earth has rubber-manufac-
ture to do with the dairy-
farmer? 1 think I can show
you that it has a lot to do with
the efficiency of the milking-
machine, and also, by the way,
of the tractor!
I refer to the “art” of
rubber-manufacture. I have
done this to emphasise that
although science plays a large
part in the modern manufac-
A fire break should be
made by burning
rather than by plough-
ing because burning
produces a clean strip
free from vegetation.
The danger area
should be sprayed with
a weed-killer whilst
the surrounding
growth is still green.
This would enable the
sprayed strip being
burned off with safety
after drying out. For
safety reasons, too,

theless, there is still a lot of
real art in the job. This is
one of the things it is im-
portant for the user to under-
stand if he is to appreciate
“ Yeah—mines a Harris tweed”
the problems involved in pro-
ducing a standard article. I’ll
come back to this later.
What Is Rubber?
Many plants produce a latex
or milky juice which contains
a rubbery substance. However,
only the South American tree,
Hevea BrazHiensis, is used in
commerce for the production
of natural rubber.
The juice of this is a
bit like milk. It has in the
watery part of it proteins (like
casein) and salts, and it also
has droplets of what is called
(chemically) a hydrocarbon, a
substance made up of hydro-
gen and carbon. .
In a way, these droplets are
rather like the butterfat drop-
lets in milk. The first part of
rubber-manufacture is to get
the rubber substance out of
the juice. One way is to add
acid, rather like making acid
casein, and to collect the curd
of coagulated rubber, press it
into sheets and dry it.
Another way uses smoke
from a wood-fire to precipi-
tate the juice which has been
concentrated on sticks dipped
in the latex. The product is
rolled into sheets and forms
a well - preservatised material
called “smoked sheet.”
The acid-coagulated product
is called “pale crepe” because
it has a light color and is used,
of course, for jobs in which
the color is important.
At the factory the raw
rubber, which is useless with-
out treatment, is mixed with
a filler, anti-oxidant, accele-
rator, zinc-oxide, sulphur and
other substances, and milled
until a homogeneous mass is
obtained.
This mass is then cut into
suitable pieces and placed in
the dies which shape it to the
form required. In the die it
is cooked under pressure so
that the sulphur can react with
the rubber substance to “vul-
canise” or strengthen it.
This sounds like a lot of
witchcraft. Why on earth are
all these things added to the
brew; why all the cookery?
Well, it’s like this. The
rubber substance is a very un-
stable hydrocarbon made up of
a unit called isoprene, a very
active substance. In the tree
this isoprene has been poly-
merised (just as plastics fac-
tories polymerise ethylene to
make polyethylene) to poly-
isoprene, or raw rubber.
Unlike polyethylene, how-
ever, the stuff is unstable and
can be made tough and fairly
resistant to air and oxygen by
adding sulphur, followed by
cooking. The sulphur
combines with the chains of
hydrocarbon and links them
together, so making a tough
structure. Unfortunately tne
isoprene is still active and is
rather fond of oxygen, so an
antioxidant is added to reduce
its appetite for this substance.
The curing process with the
sulphur is rather slow, so tin
accelerator is added to speed it
up. This also improves the
quality of the product by re-
ducing the time in the die.
Fillers are added to rubber
to give it such properties as a
suitable color or a harder
texture. Some fillers just
dilute the material and change
its color or hardness ; others
actually improve the strength
of the final product. These are
reinforcing fillers, of which the
most important are zinc-oxide
and carbon-black. The latter
is used in tyres because it
makes rubber tough, cut-
resistant and increases its re-
sistance to light. (Light acceler-
ates the tendency of rubber to
combine with oxygen ; so does
stress.)
Synthetic rubbers are arti-
ficially made substances in
which the basic molecule is
not isoprene but some other
organic material. For instance,
neoprene is made from a
molecule in which there is a
chlorine atom. In fact, it is like
isoprene with a carbon
knocked-off and a chlorine put
in its place.
Some synthetics are horribly
complicated. The nitrile
rubbers are mixed polymers of
butadiene and acrylonitrile —
enough to put one off them if
they weren’t so useful.
So far no synthetic has been
made which has the good all-
round properties of natural
rubber, but for special jobs syn-
thetics have better properties.
For instance, natural rubber
does not resist fat and oil very
well. Nitriles do. So nitrile
rubber is used when fats and
oils are about. Nitriles, how-
ever, have poor stress-resist-
ance, so have to be used in
stress-free jobs. Sometimes it
is a good idea to mix nitrile
and natural rubber to get some
of the good properties of both.
Neoprene has better fat-resist-
ance than natural rubber,
though it isn’t as good as
nitrile. It also has good stress-
resistance —better than natural
in many jobs.
Well, what’s all this got to
do with the cowshed?
We have learned a few facts
of life which are mighty
important in keeping the
milking-machine efficient. We
now know that rubber is

attacked by oxygen, particu-
larly in the presence of light.
We know that fats and oils
attack natural rubber and that
stress is bad for it. We also
know that there are rubbers
which will resist fat.
In connection with the care
of rubber the following points
will be found most helpful:
Clean all rubberware thor-
oughly after every milking.
This will prevent the building-
up of a layer of fat. Once a
week, soak all rubber tubes
and inflations in a hot solution
of good detergent. Brush with
a soft brush on the outside.
Don’t use brushes on the
insides of tubes and inflations
—they will spoil the surfaces.
Make sure all nipples to
which tubes fit are smooth and
so avoid stressing the rubber.
Always store rubber parts
between milkings out of direct
sunlight.
When using chlorine steri-
lisers, don’t soak rubber in
chlorine solutions —they attack
rubber the way oxygen does.
Never store rubber .in a
kinked state; keep it in its
natural shape in a cool place
away from light.
Now a word about the kind
of rubber to use. Most of
these remarks are really
addressed to milking-machine
people.
Use the right rubber for
each job. Milk-pipe joint-rings,
releaser- and vacuum-tank-
rings, and all other seals com-
ing in contact with milk or
exposed on the edges to light,
should be of nitrile rubber.
Releaser-flaps are best made
of a densified nitrile rubber to
give them enough weight along
with good fat-resistance.
Milk-and-air long-rubbers
are probably best made of a
natural carbon-black stock.
They are not severely affected
by fat but are subject to knock-
ing about. Good stress-resist-
ance and elasticity are needed.
Claw-tubes get the worst
treatment on the machine. It
is worth using neoprene for
them despite its cost. I have
had neoprene claw-tubes last
for 16 months without develop-
ing . any stress-cracks at all.
However, very good results
can be obtained with a good-
quality carbon-black natural-
rubber stock for claw-tubes;
such rubber has a life of a
year when used as claw-
tubing.
Inflations are a bit of a
problem. Soft inflations which
should be changed every six
weeks for reasons of hygiene
would be too expensive made
of neoprene or nitrile. In any
case the latter is poor for soft
inflations because of the stress.
A mixture, or what is called
surface-treated natural rubber,
is perhaps the best compro-
mise. Soft moulded inflations
with the claw-tube joined are
best made of neoprene. How-
ever, for inflations which are
moulded but have a separate
claw-tube, nitrile is the best,
provided that the inflation is
designed to have no stresses.
It is possible to get a life of
two years from a nitrile infla-
tion of good design. On the
other hand, poor design will
result in stress-cracking in a
few weeks.
I could spend a lot of time
discussing rubber and the
design of milking-machines.
However, I can say this: at
the present stage of develop-
ment of the art of rubber-
manufacture it is possible to
make milking-machine parts
which would last one year. I
believe what we want is a
system by which every machine
has all its rubber parts changed
every year, with the possible
exception of the long-rubbers
and bungs, which should last
two years.- Nothing should be
used which would pack-up in
less than a year. By this
means the farmer would start
with a new installation from
the rubber point of view each
season.
Because there is so much
art involved in rubber manu-
facture it is impossible to lay
down standards in terms of
composition, etc. Standards
for strength, hardness, etc.,
should be laid down, but in
the long run performance is
the test of rubber quality. The
farmer should demand rubber
parts which will meet the
requirements I have men-
tioned —a minimum life of one
year. And with this should go
regular servicing to ensure that
lubbers are changed regularly
so that the machine will not
become inefficient as a result
of failure of rubber com-
ponents.
Quick-growing
Grillers
“Big Billy”: In trials at
Parafield (S.A.) Experimental
Station, day-old crossbred
chickens were reared to the
griller stage in 11 weeks on a
high-energy all-mash ration.
Feed-consumption was 91b.
12oz. for pullets and lllb. loz.
for cockerels. This was 25 per
cent, less than in previous
trials with low-energy com-
mercial feeds, yet the grillers
reached the same weight in the
same time. Because of this
saving in quantity of feed,
there was a useful profit when
they were marketed.
Discussing the results, A. A.
McArdle said that it should
be possible in future to pro-
duce stock exclusively for
meat-raising purposes. The
quality of the grillers, combined
with the low cost due to im-
proved feeding, shows the
possibility of further expan-
sion in the industry, he said —
provided costs of handling and
retailing are also kept as low
as possible.
In the trials chickens were
in the battery-brooder for 34
weeks and on the weaner-floors
for the remaining time. Thirty
birds are the most that should
be put on each weaner-floor,
because of the danger of lower-
ing weight-gains through
overcrowding. During the 11
weeks the birds received noth-
ing but the high - energy
mixture, without green feed or
supplementary grain, but with
a proportion of crushed wheat
added during the last fortnight.
They were kept in well-
ventilated rooms, and, to
prevent panic among the birds,
a dim light was lit at night.
De-beaking at four weeks pre-
vented feather-picking ; while
trimming the first toe-nail at
seven weeks stopped back-
scratching. There’s evidently
nothing to be gained by
caponising, except perhaps with
birds beyond the griller stage.
The high-energy all-mash
ration consisted of 421 b.
crushed wheat, 201 b. crushed
barley, 7ylb. crushed oats,
221 b. meat-meal, 51b. butter-
milk-powder, 31b. lucerne-
meal, salt, |oz. manganese-
sulphate, with 4000 units-pound
of vitamin A and 800 units-
pound of vitamin D 3. A
Terramycin antibiotic supple-
ment was also used at the
manufacturers’ recommended
level.
Wafer in Agriculture
[From J. F. P. Edwards,
Senior Engineer, Farm Water-
Supplies, Water-Conservation
and Irrigation Commission .]
During the symposium on
“Water in Agriculture” (B.
19/11/ ’5B) A. G. Lowndes
is reported as expressing the
view that the Government
seems to favor flood-irrigation
as opposed to spray-irrigation.
This is not necessarily the
case ; in determining the type
of distribution-system most
suited to a particular area other
factors besides water-usage
must be considered. These in-
clude topography, type of crop,
type and structure of the soil,
wind and rainfall.
In flood-irrigation it is
essential that the surface slope
is not too steep, a figure of
about 12in. to the chain being
generally accepted as the upper
limit for satisfactory watering.
With steeper slopes it is difficult
to get uniformity of watering
without excessive run-off losses
and, possibly, erosion. The
soil should be well-drained and
loamy. This will permit uni-
form watering with the


minimum of loss. With the
heavier, close-textured and
light pervious soils uniform
watering can only be achieved
with excessive run-off losses.
Spray-irrigation is adaptable
to practically any slope ranging
from flat to steeply undulating.
The intensity and depth of
application can be varied
within close limits to suit the
slope and soil-type of any
particular site. The main dis-
advantages are distortion of
the pattern of distribution by
winds, greater evaporation-
losses, higher running-costs and
lack of flexibility. There is no
increase in unit-costs in water-
ing irregularly shaped areas.
In circumstances where it is
possible to use either method,
the deciding factor must be
cost. There is little doubt that
spray-irrigation is the more
costly of the two. A recent
investigation of three schemes
ranging in area from 80 to 100
acres showed the capital-cost of
spray-irrigation systems to be
about 30 per cent, greater than
that for flood-irrigation.
Furthermore, the annual cost
for each acre-foot of water
delivered —including interest,
depreciation and operational
charges (labor, fuel and
maintenance) was 90 per cent,
greater for spray-irrigation
than for flood-irrigation.
In such conditions it would
not be possible for spray-
irrigation to be more eco-
nomical than flood-irrigation
unless a variation in water-
usage existed. It has been
accepted by irrigation-experts
here and overseas that both
gravity and spray-irrigation
systems, properly designed and
operated, are capable of highly
efficient application, so it is
difficult to see how such a
variation can exist.
N.T. Buffaloes
“Gip”: For more than 70
years, until the bottom dropped
out of the market in 1954,
Timor water-buffaloes of the
Northern Territory were
hunted for their hides. Then,
when shooting almost ceased,
herds increased rapidly, and
might be seen in the dry
season within 10 miles of
Darwin. At places on the
Stuart Highway, great slate-
grey bulls have been known to
hold-up traffic.
The buffalo-shooters have
usually had a pet buff about
their camps, and the prospect
of taming them and exporting
the animals to Asian countries
has become a possibility.
Representatives of the Govern-
ment of the Philippines (where
water-buffaloes are used as
draught-animals and also to
provide beef) visited the Terri-
tory and saw vast herds roam-
ing the big blacksoil plains east
of Darwin.
The N.T. Administration
began capturing and taming
buffaloes last year. It was
easy for men, used to handling
the wild scrubber-cattle of the
Top End, to run-down selected
buffaloes in a jeep, throw them
by the tail and hobble them.
After being tied to a tree for
a couple of days they were
quiet enough to be yarded and
hand-fed. Those I saw in the
yards at Beatrice Hill Experi-
ment Farm, on the edge of the
buffalo country, were as tame
as dairy-cattle, happily munch-
ing rice-straw, while the calves
poked their noses through the
rails to be stroked.
Dr. Dudson, of Darwin, who
owns Marrakai Station and
runs all buffaloes and no cattle,
has also been taming a hundred
or so. Blackboys, who had
worked in the shooters’ camps
and knew all about buffalo-
handling, did their work so
well that recently 53 buffs
from Marrakai were “foot-
walked” 40 miles to the truck-
ing yards near Darwin and
railed to the wharf for ship-
ment to Hong Kong.
Whether or not a trade
in Territory buffaloes can be
established remains to be seen,
but the 500,000-odd buffaloes
of Arnhem Land are now eat-
ing grass that would support
that number of cattle.
Artificial Insemination
“Aerogenes”: In breeding
cattle artificial insemination
has several distinct advantages
over natural service.
While freedom from disease
can be maintained with natural
methods, the chance of disease
being transmitted by the bull
becomes almost negligible with
A.I. The artificial method
also makes it possible to prove
fairly quickly a bull’s inheri-
tance for production, and his
breeding can be extended
immensely in both distance and
time by freezing the semen for
travel or storage. Mr. Doyle,
director of the A.I. Station at
Berry (N.S.W.), says that only
one-third of the bulls now in
use there have proved by the
production of their daughters
that they have the power to
breed a high capacity for pro-
duction. Other bulls are chosen
for the excellence of their
ancestry, but it doesn’t neces-
sarily follow that this in-
heritance will be carried on
by any particular bull—how-
ever good the ancestry, there
is only a high probability that
the progeny will be of similar
quality.
A bull might sire thousands
of daughters before the first of
them prove to be duds, and,
conversely, many good bulls
might not even get a trial.
There are many other ancestors
than the immediate ones, and
“At last I've decided to travel the modern Way."
only an accurate production-test-
can indicate their effect. With
ordinary stud-breeding, a bull
may easily be 10 years old
before there are enough
daughters from different dams,
all tested for production, to
prove that he is worthy to sire
cattle artificially. At least six
years must pass before a bull
can be proved, and even at
this age a bull may begin to
lose the vigor that is necessary
for artificial breeding. In
order to have a fair potency
after storage, transport and
handling, semen for A.I. should
be as vigorous as possible right
from the start.
Proving a bull means that he
must be mated with cows
whose production has been
recorded for several lactations,
and that his daughters’ pro-
duction then be recorded as
soon as possible. By comparing
the average of the daughters’
figures with the average of the
mothers’ production, a figure
can be calculated which shows
the level of production inherited
from the father. The more
comparisons there are, the
more accurate this bull-index
will be -
Considering that only about
5 per cent, of all dairy-cows
in N. S. Wales are production-
recorded, it isn’t surprising
there are so few proved bulls
available. In Victoria about 17
per cent, of dairy-cows arc
recorded, but, as most of these
are Jerseys, the supply of
proved bulls of other breeds is
still very limited.
Mr. Doyle is, therefore, pre-
paring a scheme to prove a
large number of young bulls as
quickly as possible. For each
of these, mated with up to 150
cows, there should be signifi-
cant evidence of productive
capacity in about four years
from mating. Starting with a
high class of young bulls
(judged by ancestry, con-
formation and vigor) it will be
something indeed to be able
to select, say, five outstanding
proved ones and another five
well above the average. Each,
in . his lifetime, could be the
father of perhaps 4000
markedly productive females.
What a lift a continuing pro-
gramme of such provings will

give to our general level of
dairy-production.
Dairyfarmers can help the
scheme by using whatever
semen they are asked to use,
and by careful rearing of the
resulting heifers, which must
be retained in the herd. Then
they should set-about recording
the production of the dams and
the daughters as carefully as
possible, keeping conditions
even and noting any variations
of feed, climate, etc. Finally
they should encourage the
extension of the herd-recording
system and help to reduce the
faults which now hold it back.
When the bulls to be used in
A.I. have been accurately
selected, the others can be
discarded with little harm done.
None of the bulls’ semen will
be used after the first siring of
daughters for the proving, but
semen will be taken regularly
from every bull and deep-
frozen. When the bulls are
discarded their semen goes
likewise, but when the bull is
proved good all his frozen
semen is available for use in
breeding, as well as the fresh
semen for the rest of his life.
Deep - frozen semen can be
sent all over the world and
can also be stored for many
years, thereby facilitating a
line-breeding or in-breeding
programme long after the key
bull is dead.
The average production of
the dairy-cows recorded in
N.S.W. (the best 5 per cent,
of all the cows) is very low—
-47391b. of milk containing
2081 b. butterfat over six to 10
months. A big lift in produc-
tion per cow is one of the most
powerful and permanent ways
of improving farm-economy.
With a chance like this scheme
for proving bulls for artificial
insemination, every dairy-
farmer should give his full
support and co-operation.
Mechanical Milking
“Old Stockman”: Reading
W. G. Whittlestone’s articles,
I was surprised to find how
much there is to learn about
milking-machines. I thought
they were foolproof by now.
In 1918 I put a machine in
my dairy at Kalgoorlie to milk
60-odd cows twice daily. The
plant was driven by an old
Lister 4|-h.p. engine which also
acted as generator for about
20 lights for the 1 a.m. milk-
ing. We had eight bails and
two of us handled the job. The
cows all knew their turn as
well as which bail to go into.
The cooling-room was about
60ft. away, and milk ran down
over pipes with a stream of
water running through them for
cooling.
Beating Pleuro.
“Agricola”: An all-out
attack against pleuro-pneu-
monia has been planned for
Queensland this year. Inocu-
lation against the disease, has
been going on steadily for
many years—in 1957, over
half-a-million cattle were
inoculated —but it is hoped to
immunise over one-million in
1959.
Any old-timer will recall the
outbreaks among , travelling
stock, when big mobs of
bullocks went down on the
track, and there was nothing
to be done about it. As more
became known about the
disease; efforts were made to
inoculate cattle with virus
obtained from the chest-cavity
of a beast that had the disease.
The fluid was strained and
setons, saturated with it, were
passed through the animal’s
skin —a favorite site was the
dewlap. Such a hit-and-miss
method was often bound to
bring disappointment. What
was not clearly understood
then was that a beast could die
after being setoned, because
it was a carrier and infected.
A hard journey on foot, with
little water and food, was all
that was necessary to bring the
trouble to a head.- And food
and water were often scarce on
some of those old-time stock-
routes.
In the denser cattle-areas
near the coast and the inland
side of the Great Dividing
Range, pleuro. is now almost
unknown. Control-measures,
inoculations and early
diagnosis of the trouble have
all helped to stamp it out. On
the larger runs outback, where
cattle may die without much
notice being taken, the position
could be very different. Beasts
which have been in contact
with carriers can break-down
under hardship and become
active cases of pleuro.
Although outbreaks are now
generally confined to infected
stock during a drought or on
a dry stock-route, it is not im-
possible for fat prime cattle to %
go down with the disease. Once
the disease is recognised,
though, quarantine-measures
can be enforced and stock
inoculated. This is one time
when stockmen don’t mind the
severe restrictions of quaran-
tine. It’s bad enough to have
a case of pleuro. on the pro-
perty, but worse to do nothing
about it. So there is generally
co-operation all round. In the
past many cases of pleuro. were
not recognised because they
were not “typical.” As with
most serious diseases, there is
no “typical” set of symptoms
that covers all phases of the
disease. Old-time drovers
diagnosed pleuro. when one or
two beasts hung back and
dropped out of the mob, but
any sick beast will do that.
Straw-colored fluid in the chest-
cavity was cpnsidered a neces-
sary symptom for definite
diagnosis. It is now known
that this is not always so. But
science has since come up with
an infallible blood-test, and,
if there is the slightest suspi-
cion that pleuro. is about, it is
time to get moving.
Stock-owners can inoculate
their own stock with a
specially prepared vaccine. But
remember to use clean syringes,
wash the hands regularly and
take care of the vaccine. Jt
should be stored in the
refrigerator while waiting to
be used, and kept in a' vacuum
flask when it is needed at the
yards the easiest way to
render it useless is to leave it
exposed to heat and direct
sunlight.
Crosscuts
“Sundowner”: Stereocin, a
combination of steresan and
neomycin, is being used in the
U.S.A. to control mastitis. It’s
claimed that bacteria do not
become resistant to it, and
that even if it found its way
into the milk-supply it would
cause no adverse reaction to
humans.
“C.A.A.”: Printed woollen
fabrics, recently launched
in a display held at Richard
Austin’s historic property at
Avalon (Vic.), seem likely to
have a considerable effect in
our wool-economy.
The goods displayed were as
fine as silk, with qualities
against which substitute-fabrics
must find it hard to compete
(one claim made is that the
materials are healthier to wear).
The display was organised
by Silk and Textiles, of Hobart,
and Classic Weaving Mills
(Aust.), who pioneered the
process here.
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(1/1/’59)
Heavy rains are likely throughout Queensland during
February, with possible widespread flooding. Similar rains
and flooding may continue during March, although rainfall
may become light in the far south-west area.
N.S.W. should receive moderate to good general rains
during February, with heaviest falls on the North Coast,
and on the northern tablelands and n.-w. slopes and plains
areas. Rainfall may be patchy in March, apart from moderate
rains on the coast, although moderate general rains seem
likely in April.
Fairly heavy rains should be received in the whole of
Victoria during February, and good general rains may be
expected in March. Rainfall may be patchy during the late
autumn and winter.
Moderate to heavy rains are indicated in the agricul-
tural areas and n.-w. interior of South Australia during
February, but rainfall may be patchy in March and April,
with seasonal rains starting in May.
In Western Australia good rains are indicated for the
North Kimberleys during February, but rainfall may be poor
elsewhere. A period of poor rainfall may follow with fair
seasonal rains starting in May.

By means of wooden panels, which
are finely grained, the whole thing
can be turned into a table-like piece
of furniture. Keyboard range is
from F through six octaves to F.
Just above the keys is a faded
inscription reading “Robert Wolf,
Successor to Gerock Astor and Co.”
followed by “No. 70.” This is . the
only information as to how old the
piano is, and it’s a pretty faint
clue. Anyone help me? Would
this be the only instrument of its
type in Australia?

What is the origin of the church
altar ?
It is a table, usually of stone, on
which sacrifice is offered; the use
of altars seems to have been almost
universal in all times and among all
nations. Early sacrificial hearths
have been excavated in Palestine,
these conforming to the primitive
type described in the early parts of
the Old Testament. Later there
were two kinds of altar in use
among the Jews, for burnt-offering
and incense respectively. In ancient
Greece and Rome altars were low
pedestals which stood inside the
temple before the sacred image, or
large erections in the open air, used
for burnt sacrifice. Altars have
always been places of refuge, and
frequently places for the solemnisa-
tion of oaths. The earliest
Christians had no fixed altars, but
they came into use with the cessa-
tion of persecution, and were
erected over the relics of martyrs.
The altar was nearly square in shape
and placed in the axis of the
church. In cathedrals, monastic
churches and some larger parish-
churches there are several altars,
the chief being the “high altar.”

Details of the Baghdad Pact ?
This defensive and economic pact
was first signed at Baghdad between
Turkey and Iraq in February, 1955.
Subsequently Britain (April), Paki-
stan (September) and Persia
(November) signed. Its existence
provided a centre of relative
stability in the Middle East, but it
aroused the hostility of the more
militant members of the Arab
League, and attempts to secure
Jordan’s adherence resulted in riots
in Amman. Following Anglo-
French intervention in Suez, the
Moslem members of the pact met
without Britain; but by 1957 there
were signs that British active
participation in the pact was again
being considered by them.

Information on the working of
proportional ~ representation in
Senate elections ?
The Hare-Clark system of pro-
portional-representation is the only
one to be adopted in Australia. It
was first used by Tasmania in
1907, was in force in N.S.W.
between 1919 and 1926, and was
adopted for the Senate in 1949. To
secure election, a candidate must
at some stage of the count obtain
a quota of votes, calculated by
dividing the number of valid votes
cast by one more than the number
of seats to be filled, and adding
1 to the quotient so obtained. If a
candidate gets more than his quota
on first-preferences, his surplus is
distributed among the candidates
obtaining his second-preferences
with a “distribution value” per
preference calculated by dividing his
surplus by the total of his first-
preference votes. A correspond-
ing distribution is carried out at
each stage of the count at which a
candidate gains more than the
quota. (With the Senate, the
counting is simplified by a system of
taking random samples.) At stages
when there is no candidate with a
quota on the votes then being
counted, the candidate with the
lowest total at that stage is elimi-
nated and his preferences are dis-
tributed at unity value.

How did Patrick Bugden win his
V.C. in World War I ? What ww
his citation ?
According to K. R. Cramp’s
Australian Winners of the Victoria
Cross in the Great War 1914-19,
compiled from official records, Pte.
Patrick Bugden. 31st. Batt., A.1.F.,
was posthumously awarded the V.C.
“for most conspicuous bravery and
devotion to duty when on two
occasions our advance was
temporarily held-up by strongly-
defended pill-boxes. Pte. Bugden,
in the face of devastating fire from
machine-guns, gallantly led small
parties to attack these strong points
and, successfully silencing the
with bombs, captured
the garrison at the point of the
bayonet. On another occasion,
when a corporal, who had been
detached from his company, had
been captured and was being taken
to the rear of the enemy, Pte.
Bugden, single-handed, rushed to
the rescue of his comrade, shot one
enemy and bayoneted the remain-
ing two, thus releasing the
corporal. On five occasions he
rescued wounded men under intense
shell- and machine-gun fire, show-
ing an utter contempt and dis-
regard for danger. Always fore-
most in volunteering for any
dangerous mission, it was during
the execution of one of these mis-
sions that this gallant soldier was
killed (Sept. 26-28, 1917).” Bugden
was bom at Gundurimba (N.S.W.)
in March, 1897, and enlisted in
May, 1916. He won the V.C. at
Polygon Wood, near Ypres (Bel-
gium).

What is a pibgorn ?
It is very rare and considered a
traditional musical instrument of
Wales, and has been associated
traditionally with shepherds. There
are only three authentic specimens
in existence. One was presented to
the London Society of Antiquaries
in 1770, and reported as being
unique to North Wales, excepting
Anglesey. Another, of the 18th
century, is from Voelas, Bettws-y-
Coed, Carnarvonshire, and pro-
bably from Anglesey, and another
was bought in a North Wales
cottage. In the latter a wooden
mouthpiece contains two reeds, and
each of two wooden pipes, bound
together, have a horn at the end.
In the two former specimens the
reed is enclosed in a mouth-horn.
In all specimens each wooden pipe
has six finger-stops. Its tone has
been described as similar to that of
an oboe.

A softener for greenhide to
enable it to be plaited and
remain pliable afterwards ?
Soak it in water until it becomes
pliable, then hang to dry. When
dry, rub in fat or neatsfoot-oil.
Always hang greenhide-ropes, reins,
etc., out of the sun after use.
Well-made greenhide shouldn’t go
hard. Next time you treat a skin,
try this method: To remove the
hair and flesh, make a liquor of
2oz. unslaked lime to every gallon
of water necessary to cover the hide.
If the hair then comes out readily,
start unhairing, but if it still
remains firm make a fresh liquor
and soak again. Over a rounded
surface carefully scrape the hair and
flesh off" with a blunt instrument.
Wash the lime off and soak hide in
water for another day. Make-up
a curing-bath of 6oz. alum, 3oz. salt
to each gallon of water and soak for
four days. Before taking the hide
out make a slit in the neck and see
if the hide is a greyish color right
through; if there is a streak in the
centre of the hide leave it in the
liquor until the streak disappears.
The hide will then need at least two
washings in clean water, and should
be hung to dry away from sun and
wind. When dry, rub fat or
paraffin-wax thoroughly into both
sides of the hide until it is soft and
flexible.

General information on Fulbright
Scholarships ?
The Fulbright scheme, an educa-
tional enterprise providing for the
exchange of scholars and students
between the U.S.A. and certain
foreign countries, was established
under an Act (1946) of Congress
sponsored by Senator J. W. Ful-
bright, a former president of the
University of Arkansas and a
Rhodes scholar. The section of the
agreement relating to Australia was
signed at Canberra on November
26, 1949 ; it involves the exchange
of scholars on the financial basis
of a debt of $5 million owed to


the U.S.A. by Australia as a result
of war-time lend-lease and surplus-
property settlements. Not more
than 10 per cent, of the total is used
in any one year.
The amount of the grant made
to each scholar is determined by his
professional standing and by the
availability of funds. Grants are
made in all branches of education
for study, and research,
and include payments for transpor-
tation, tuition, maintenance and
other expenses incidental to
scholastic activity.
The American Secretary of State
is responsible for the general
administration of the Act. The
Board of Foreign Scholarships is
responsible for the selection of
participants, and works in co-
operation with and is advised by the
United States Education Founda-
tion in Australia, which has a
board of seven members with both
American and. Australian repre-
sentatives.

Particulars concerning a tree
called Indian almond, which grows
in the tropical areas of Australia ?
It is a large deciduous tree grow-
ing to a height of 80ft., with
branches spreading in horizontal
whorls. It yields a dark-colored
substance known in the West Indies
as Indian almond-gum. The bark
and leaves are astringent and con-
tain tannin. In the Indies the
leaves are mixed with iron-salts to
form a black pigment with which
the natives color their teeth. The
seeds are like almonds in shape and
whiteness, and are palatable and
nutritious. The kernels yield a
valuable oil similar to almond-oil,
but a little more deeply colored.
The tree is ornamental, with a
brown, waved, heavy, coarse-
grained timber. It grows near, the
coast, and its fruits are especially
adapted for dispersal by ocean-
currents, because of the layer of
fibre between seed and outer coat.

(1) Who invented the dynamo ?
(2) A few details of his life ?
(1) Michael Faraday (1791-1867)
made the discovery of magneto-
electrical induction, upon which
principle all dynamos are based.
The unit of capacity, the “farad,”
was named after him. (2) Born at
Newington Butts, London, he was
the son of a blacksmith. He assisted
Sir Humphrey Davy at the Royal
Institution, finally becoming director
of the laboratory. In 1833 he was
made Fullerian Professor of the
institution for life. In that year
he proved that electricity from
different sources was identical, and
in the following year came the dis-
covery of equivalents in electro-
chemical decomposition. In 1838
he announced the results of his
researches' on electro-static induc-
tion, and showed the relation
between electric and magnetic
forces. In 1845 he published a des-
cription of the properties of diamag-
netic bodies, and in 1846 of
magnetic rotary polarisation. . Fara-
day ranks among the most brilliant
experimenters known. He died at
Hampton Court.

What is the difference between
ether and chloroform ?
Chloroform consists of carbon,
hydrogen and chlorine, ether of
carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The
two drugs closely resemble each
other in general anaesthetic effects,
but differ in power and other
important points. About four times
as much ether is needed to produce
the same degree of anaesthesia as
when chloroform is used. The
depressant effect of chloroform on
the brain is 3 to times as great
as that of ether, and its power to
arrest respiration is about 3 times as
great. The depressant action of
chloroform on the heart is about 25
tc 30 times that of ether, the dan-
gerous cardiac embarrassment which
is seen under chloroform is rare
under ether. Because it has to be
given in more concentrated form to
produce anresthesia, ether causes
more irritation of the air passages
and secretion of saliva and mucus.
Anaesthesia is induced with greater
difficulty, more slowly and often less
perfectly than with chloroform,
and the stage of excitement is
generally more violent and pro-
longed. The virtue of ether is that
its action on the heart and respira-
tion is much less dangerous than
that of chloroform. The latter
drug is non-inflammable and better
tolerated by alcoholics and plethoric
people.

Following closely on the heels of
Sabrina came Ava Gardner, here with
Gregory Peck to make Nevil Shute’s “On
the Beach.” The glamorous star is staying
at the St. James Hotel in Darling Street,
a very quiet hideaway, but crowds watch
outside daily hoping to catch a glimpse
of her. Plum Rutherford is the envy of
all her friends, for she will be Ava’s
private secretary during the filming. Ava
was not present at the press-party given
at the Savoy-Plaza Hotel, but Gregory
Peck, who was, charmed presswomen
with his easy manner and the friendly
way in which he answered questions.
While in Melbourne, Gregory, his wife
and children, will live at Kurneh, the

With the school-holidays entering their
final phase the Mornington Peninsula is,
as it were, a hive of indolence. From
Frankston almost to Sorrento tents and
caravans dot the Bay-front. Portsea (the
Palm Beach of Victoria) is a particularly
favored spot. At “Lazy Days” Mrs.
Constance Day is in residence with her
son Neville and daughter Deanna.
Visitors to this pleasant seaside-home
over the holidays included Mr. and Mrs.
John Carrodus and their children Robert
and Suzanne, and Mrs. John Buckland and
her daughters Anne and Mary Lou. Mr.
and Mrs. George Laurens, their daughters
Diana and Fay, and son Peter are also at
Portsea, and had David Jones as a house-
guest. With 'Mr. George Dickenson at
his lovely home were his son-in-law and
daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Erl Grey, and
dining with them on one occasion were
Mr. and Mrs. Bill Lempriere. The Ralph
Freedmans holidayed with their
daughters Anne and Prue and Mrs. Ada
Colman, who is Mrs. Freedman’s
mother. Others who lazed in the sun and
swam in the clear water of this bayside
resort were twin sisters Elizabeth and
Patricia Mildred, Caroline Wilkinson and
Wendy Pisterman (these two will shortly
fly to England on a holiday-trip), Virginia
Smith and Jennie Stratmann.

Many people have become acquainted,
through the book, with that fantastic but
charming character Auntie Marne. She
will come to life on the stage of the
Princess Theatre on February 19, and Shirl
Conway, who will portray the role, will
arrive from the U.S. this week to begin
rehearsals with American producer Eddie
Bayliss. Tall and slim, Shirl favors an
unusual hairdo called the “Butch”-cut,
a feminine version of the male crew-cut
and not much longer. This American
actress chose the haircut because she
likes wearing wigs. Her part calls for the
wearing of four exotic wigs, including one
red and one blue. Three of these are
made of natural hair and are valued at
350 dollars each. The blue wig, of nylon,
was a modest 125 dollars. In the show
Shirl wears 20 wonderful costumes, and
has the figure to show them to the best
advantage.
A schoolteacher before she married,
Mrs. Ernest Greenhalf, of Brighton, is
now doing a splendid job as liaison-
officer for the Royal Children’s Hospital.
Her last successful effort was the organis-
ing of the Miss Summer Festival Quest,
which raised thousands of pounds for
the hospital. Margaret Wootton was the
winner, and accompanied by Mrs. Green-
half, is now in Orsova on a cruise to
New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. Delighted
at the success of the quest, the committee
connected with it presented Mrs. Greeny-
half with a string of cultured pearls and
earrings. Photo by Spencer Shier.
Xavier College Chapel was the setting

Kew. The bride chose a gown of white
appiiqued nylon which featured a boat-
shaped neckline and full skirt with a
straight front-panel. Small white roses
and lily-of-the-valley held her fingertip-
veil. Her sister Maria, Karen Hoppe and
Jillian Lambert were bridesmaids. Dr.
Desmond Hurley was best man, and John

shades will be worn by Bunty Turner,
who will be the Lady. Also, Kayser are

and quite unlike any pink yet seen.
There are gloves in this delightful shade
made in Elascott permanently-embossed
cotton, and wrist-length. The night-

This is the season of the sales in
Sydney. Or rather, they may be called
“the sales before the sales,” for although
the retailers are taking the pathetic line
this year: “800-hoo, we’ve got too many
things ; please come and take them off
our hands,” it won’t be until next month
that they will get really frantic and start
throwing ballast overboard in the form
of real bargains. At present there are still
diehards who hope for the higher price,
like the arcade milliner who offered a
wide white hat this week for 10 guineas.
“Isn’t it a bit late in the season to pay
so much for a summer hat?” brought
the reply, “Oh dear no, madam. Our
summer season is just beginning.” Some
people will say anything.

The twilight race-meeting at Randwick
proved quite a success —cool, casual and
comfortable, with the races finishing at
6.30 and picnic-dinners, or hot meals at
the racecourse, continuing until welLafter
dark. The cricket, which is the main
sporting topic at present, was rather
dampened by the rain. One of the huge
crowd who waited from early morning on
Saturday until late afternoon for the
game to start commented: “Wouldn’t
you think that the English, of all people,
would have a national game that wasn’t
dependent on the weather!” It was an

The art that conceals art was shown by
film-star Ava Gardner when she arrived
in Sydney during the week. Most of
the men who caught a glimpse of her
thought she was without make-up, but
the women knew that it takes the greatest
skill to achieve just that correct degree
of pallor which is fashionable today.
Dressed in her Italian-model dress of
black silk-faille with its white pie-frill
at the neckline, her jewellery a fob-watch
and two gold bracelets, Miss Gardner
was a model of elegant dressing. She was
frankly un-self-conscious about her age
(36) and was gently diplomatic when
answering a reporter who asked if it
would be ungallant to suggest that the
tiny scars on her face were not caused
by a fall from a horse as reported. “Yes,”
said the film-star. “It would be un-
gallant.”
Film-stars seem to be swarming round
these parts of late. In addition to Miss
Gardner there are Gregory Peck,
Anthony Perkins and Fred Astaire work-
ing in Melbourne on Stanley Kramer’s
production of Nevil Shute’s best-seller
On the Beach, while in Sydney Ernest
Borgnine, John Mills, Anne Baxter and
Angela Lansbury are working on the
production of “The Summer of the Seven-
teenth Doll” at Pagewood. The Harry
Watt production “The Siege” had Heather
Sears and Aldo Ray working here until
just before Christmas, and the latest star
to arrive is English actor Trevor Howard.
He, so it is said, is primarily attracted
by the fact that the third Test is in pro-
gress, but during this three weeks here
he will also attend previews in Sydney,
Melbourne and Adelaide of “The Key,”
a war-film in which he plays a leading

The psychologists, who are great ones
for finding things out, have discovered
(so it is reported from England) that
hundreds of British children are suffering
from “schoolphobia,” a new kind of
mental disturbance about which they
know very little. A Sydney psychiatrist
commented that “the child’s reaction,
either being sick or screaming when it
arrives at school, is simply the child’s
way of expressing its inability to cope
with a situation which is worrying it.”
In other words, it doesn’t like school.
This is a problem with which parents
have been faced since schoobgoing began,
and it is quite common, as any young
mother could tell you. Nor is it the timid
child only who reacts unfavorably to its
first journey into the wide, wide world.
One little girl who is very self-reliant,
confident and independent was sent to
school when she was four-and-a-half
because she begged to be allowed to go,
and because she seemed quite sufficiently
advanced to do so. After the first day
she said she didn’t like it. On the second
she declared she was “going to throw her
lunch into the bin” (the height of
audacity!). On the third day she had
“a bad pain,” and on the fourth dug her
heels in and refused to go.
The explanation of her sc’noolphobia
was that, being the youngest girl in the
school, everyone made a fuss of her.
Some children would like this, but this
little one has the qualities that would
make her a leader among equals. She
resented being regarded as a pet and a
toy. Hers was an unexpected reaction,
but just another example of how a fear
of school can arise.
Of course, there are children who
delight in the first day at school, like
the little boy whose anxious mother
noted with relief that there were two
other new boys there whom he had
known at kindergarten. When he came
home full of tales about school his
mother asked him had he talked to these
two. “Oh, no,” he replied, surprised, “I
didn’t talk to them. 1 knew them.”

Cosmetics for children are apparently
becoming big business in America. It is
depressing to see in one of the leading
magazines in the U.S. a full-page
advertisement showing a little girl no
more than nine years old thanking her
father for a gift of “her very own” com-
pact, face-powder, lipstick and comb.
She may also have a bubble-bath, two
nail-polishes, hand-lotion and special
toilet-water. It is reported also that
some little U.S. girls are being allowed
to have a small copy of everything their
mothers wear, and miniature mink coats,
high-heeled shoes and fashion-hats are
being made especially to supply the
demand.

It is expected that Princess Alexandra
will probably spend a week in this State
in September after she has attended
Queensland’s centenary celebrations this
year. The tentative arrangements at pre-
sent are for the princess to arrive in Can-
berra from England on August 15, go to
Queensland on August 18, then visit New
South Wales on September 8, leaving for
Victoria on September 16, whence she
will go to Canberra on September 23
before her departure for England.

The Leaving Certificate results just
published gave evidence of another blow
struck successfully for feminism. Hitherto
city boys’ results appeared a day earlier
than the girls’—an injustice meekly
borne. This year the girls came first and
in future will alternate —very right, con-
sidering the anguish that extra day’s
waiting entails.


Coppleson smiles politely at stories of
natives diving in and ripping sharks
up the belly. Blowing bubbles or
directing bubbles from a diving-suit at
sharks, or splashing to frighten them
away, are of doubtful value. But
shouting at them under water does
seem to frighten them. Getting on their
backs and riding them, as some U.S.
authorities advised their G.l.’s to do
during the last war, is harder than it
looks, if only because the teeth of the
shark’s skin would tear a man’s thighs
up (a great many wounds in shark-
attacks are caused by the grazing of
the shark’s skin). Yet sharks have
been ridden, and from the hundreds of
bloody, tragic and heroic shark-stories
in this book one makes no apology for
selecting the story of The Bad-
tempered Diver: —
In the Dangerous Islands (the
Tuamotos) a bad-tempered native
diver came face-to-face with an
equally bad-tempered 12ft. shark
... .The diver took refuge in a coral
tavern, but the shark came in right
behind him. Seeing no other means
of escape, the native struggled
desperately on to the shark’s back
and buried his fingers deeply into its
wide gills.
This was an unexpected turn of
events for the shark. It became
terrified and rushed to the surface
with such speed that it shot clear of
the water, turned in mid-air, dived to
the bottom again, and then resurfaced
with the diver hanging on like a
bronco - buster. Maddened, the
shark headed towards a slightly sub-
merged reef where it beached, high
and dry. The native slid from the
monster’s back and walked unaided
to the beach, his body torn and
bloody from the shark’s rough skin
and collisions with the sharp coral.
He thought the matter over for a
few minutes, worked himself into a
rage, strode back to the shark and
aimed a terrific blow at its snout
with his fist. The shark’s mouth
flashed open and took off his hand.
Considering various ways of protect-
ing surfers from sharks, Dr. Copple-
son says “shark-proof enclosures” tend
to rust or break, and so increase the
risk with a promise of safety; but he
comes out strong for meshing, in nets
of 12in. squares, which destroyed 3210
sharks along Sydney beaches from
1939 to 1956. On the other hand, if
the meshed sharks are expected to be
part of the contractors’ return, they
are a diminishing return. Of the
sharks taken above, 1973 were taken
in the first four years, and only 1237
in the next nine years. Whether this
means that meshing may level sharks
with the dodo, Mr. Coppleson doesn’t
say; but he considers that the meshing
of such large numbers of them
increases the food available for the
survivors, and this makes them less
likely, again, to attack humans.
The book begins with references to
sharks by Pliny, etc. There is a theory
that Jonah’s whale was a shark, and
maybe recent study of the shark’s
ability to, as it were, refrigerate ani-
mals, or human legs and arms, for long
periods without decomposition >—
although extremely voracious, they
need very little food, and seem to take
people, or parts of them, along merely
for the ride —is some proof that an
outsize in sharks sw'allowed Jonah
whole. The English, putting to sea
comparatively late in life, had no word
for shark when they first saw one, and
called it by the Spanish name, tiburon.
But of course the Greeks had a word
for it—indeed, in 725 B.C. they had a
drawing of it, on a vase which is repro-
duced and reconstructed opposite
page 32.
Altogether, when one puts Dr.
Coppleson’s book down, with its
graphs, maps, plates, drawings of
sharks, tabulations of their species and
copious small-print appendices, there
doesn’t seem much left to say on the
subject; while for those who like fish-
stories, authenticated, but of extreme
height, here is a volume unlikely to be
surpassed.
"Don’t Type in Bed"
Peggy Warner is one of those
remarkable women who marry foreign
correspondents and raise families in a
succession of strange houses in the
cities their husbands use as bases while
they rove about for weeks on end in
search of foreign news. Don’t Type in
Bed (Cheshire) is a light but sometimes
sharply perceptive account of how, for
10 years, while her husband covered
the Korean war, the Singapore riots,
the anti-terrorist campaign in Malaya
and scores of other South-east Asian
stories for an Australian paper, she
house-hunted and house-kept in Japan
and Singapore, had three children,
coped with earthquakes, storms, burg-
lars, ghosts, servants ranging from the
incompetent to the overcompetent,
security-men who wanted to find and
perhaps stop her husband’s news-
sources, and sundry other rufflers, large
and small, of the surface of domestic
life.
Generally it is all straight from the
woman’s angle: the priceless things
servants and children say and do, the
dilemmas over clothes and food, the
trials of shopping in Eastern markets,
the embarrassment when the cook
made a chocolate gravy for the
chicken on the night the important
guests came, and so on—superior
women’s-magazine writing, mostly;
but, remembering how many reporters
have been wounded or killed in South-
east Asia, # one feels between the crisp
lines the underlying resourcefulness,
courage and keen sense of humor the
author must have had to be able to
get so much fun out of this kind of
life.
There are excellent chapters about
Williamstown (Vic.), the author’s
birthplace, and a huge, queer mansion
in Singapore with stone columns, bat-
proof netting, a shrine to the gods, and
a ghost; but there are also some unfor-
tunate platitudes about people and
races being much the same all the
world over.
Round the World
Barbara Toy, author of three books
(the “Fool” series) about her travels
alone around North Africa in a Land-
Rover, has now written one about a
recent journey right round the world—•
Columbus Was Right (Murray).
It is very much what books about
quick world-tours usually are: a packed
mixture of information about roads,
weather, food, hotels and mechanical
repairs; short, hard looks at too many
towns and cities; hullo - goodbye
sketches of people met; and a few,
surprisingly few, accounts of adven-
tures, or near-adventures, mainly in the
Eastern countries.
The information is sensible and
concise, and much of it would be handy
if you ever wanted to do the same
trip, but somehow one misses the feel-
ing of adventure. It seems that Miss
Toy is either too self-effacing or has
travelled like this so often that she no
longer sees anything remarkable in it:
even when she is going through the
Thailand jungle towards Malaya with
the police trying everywhere to stop
her, there is little excitement in the
writing; and once, in the same country:
I came back to my hotel very late
one night. It had been a mixed,
disturbing evening. Dining with a
wealthy merchant, full of tales as
gay and vibrating as the flouncing
processional umbrellas. Good food,
pleasant company, touching for a
moment the real tempo of the East.
Then a situation out of which it had
been almost impossible to extricate
myself; of being up against the flat
pan-faced Occidental; of being near
to panic. Disturbing, too. Was I
slipping? Had I, at last, lost the
power to sense trouble? I returned
to my hotel dispirited.
Which seems to be underplaying it a
bit too much.
When she arrives in Australia, after
an absence of many years, and drives
across it and up to Cape York, you
get, instead of the sharpened impres-
sions of the native returning, a mere
procession of well-known facts about
towns and districts, obviously for the
benefit of the English or American


reader —pure journalism enlivened
only by those sharp but all-too-brief
encounters with wayside people.
And the last leg, across the U.S.
from ’Frisco to New York, is taken at
such a bat that it is hard to see any-
thing through Miss Toy’s dust.
Idriess on Tin
The Annual for 1958 of lon Idriess
is mainly on tin: Back o’ Cairns
(Angus and Robertson) is the story of
how the Hodgkinson River goldfield
was opened-up by men who took the
long way round behind the moun-
tains from Cooktown, then bashed a
path through the precipitous ranges to
establish a more convenient seaport at
Port Douglas.
The story is also of how the better
harborage of Cairns, at which a
canvas-town had gone up, would have
been preferred to Port Douglas except
that they couldn’t get down to it with
horses and carts; but of how Cairns
persevered, and beat Port Douglas to
the railway, surveyor Monk declaring
for the Barron Valley route. Thus were
opened-up not only the inland mines
but also the coastal cedar.
The story is also of squatter Ather-
ton, of Atherton Tablelands, who was
interested only in cattle, but led pros-
pectors to where he had seen solid
blocks of tin; and of “Tin King”
John Moffat’s town of Irvinbank, and
how everybody loved him; and of how
he became the Moffat of the agricul-
tural-machinery firm of Moffat Virtue.
There is also an old Tablelands
identity called the Jungle Man, with
whom Idriess wanders hand-in-hand
through the last quarter of the book.
It would not be too much to say that
one doesn’t quite believe in this
character; in fact, Idriess seems a bit
agnostic about him, too; but he makes
a good audience for Idriess’s thoughts
about life and Nature, and he manages
to tell Idriess a great deal about the
history and development of the back
country, and about its flowers, birds
and spiders, that Idriess pretends he
doesn’t know himself.
Abandoned Beckett
It is hard to see why Samuel
Beckett’s From an Abandoned Work
(Faber) was issued as a separate book
—it is a mere 22-page fragment, and
though it seems fairly complete, it is,
without explanation or foreword,
unsatisfactory.
But, then, the whole publication in
English of Beckett’s work has so far
been unsatisfactory. Fabers have
handled the plays; Calders have issued
one novel (R.P. 16/7/’5B), a French
publisher another; a few have come
out in American paperbacks and are
hard to get; and one is said to be
banned. It is also said that the later
novels relate to each other, so it is
quite possible that this fragment has
some connection with one or all of
them, or perhaps with one that hasn’t
been translated yet. But then, again, a
publisher’s note on this edition says
that the fragment has been broadcast
by the 8.8. C., so perhaps the work
was neither a novel nor abandoned,
and this is simply a short-story with a
curious name.
Be all that as it may, the narrator
here is certainly an abandoned piece
of work —another of Beckett’s deranged
old men, twitching about at the end of
his tether, recalling the terrible and
meaningless beauty of his life. He
tries to describe a day in his youth, but,
unable to stay on his subject, keeps
wandering away from the particular
to the general, or just wandering; and
at the end: —
I often thought of that up in the
mountains, no, that is a foolish thing
to say, just went on, my body doing
its best without me.
And that’s that.
But if you go near any of Beckett’s
strained and twitching people they grab
you and get their claws into you, and
you can feel and hear them long after
their strangely beautiful voices have
died away. This one is no exception.
New Zealand Novels
During 1958 New Zealand writing
was enriched by three very good novels:
lan Cross’s The God Boy, Sylvia
Asheton Warner’s The Spinster and
Ruth France’s The Race.
lan Cross, who is now Public Rela-
tions Officer with the New Zealand
Army, won a scholarship in journalism
to Harvard University which gave him
a breathing-space in which to write
most of this book. He gives a sensi-
tive picture of a domestic tragedy seen
through the eyes of an 11-year-old boy.
The family are Catholics, and in his
convent-school the boy, who had
always thought of himself as being on
the side of God, a “God-boy,” now
finds himself questioning the justice
of a being who has played such a trick
on him and put him in the wrong. “The
God Boy” is to be issued in Penguins
in 1959.
Spinster is an account of life in a
small Maori school in the North Island,
told by an unconventional teacher, a
spinster, whose ways are not particu-
larly favored by the educational
authorities. The Race concerns a
yacht-race from Wellington to Lyttle-
ton in which disaster overtakes one of
the contestants, and the story is con-
cemed equally with those at sea and
those waiting on the land.
Apart from the novel, history con-
tinues to flourish in the hands of Keith
Sinclair, whose The Origins of the
Maori Wars has just been published,
and John Miller, whose Early Vic-
torian New Zealand is a study of social
life in several selected settlements of
the New Zealand Company.
Biography and autobiography have
been strengthened over the last year
or so by E. H. McCormick’s studies of
the painter Francis Hodgkins, June
O pie’s Over My Dead Body and Denis
McEldowney’s The World Regained.
J. M. Thomson.
Reviewed Briefly
I, Anastasia: the documented auto-
biography of a soidisant Romanoff
(Michael Joseph). This middle-aged
woman, who now lives in a disused
Army hut in the Black Forest, continues
with her 40-year-long claim to be the
Tsar’s youngest daughter. An extra-
ordinary and absorbing story which
bears little relationship to the glamor-
ised play and film. Whoever she is,
this unhappy soul has had an unenvi-
ably harsh life. If, finally, the reader is
unconvinced, the fault may well be the
author’s own, for her odd behavior to
her putative kin is difficult to explain
except in terms of mental stress.

The Russian Revolution: Alan
Moorehead (Collins; Hamilton).
Moorehead’s special purpose is to
emphasise the extent to which the
Germans, anxious to have the Russians
collapse and make a separate peace in
World War I, fomented and financed
the revolution. His book is based on
material supplied to him- by Dr.
Possony and his study-group at
Georgetown University, largely an
analysis of the archives of the German
Foreign Office which fell into the
Allies’ hands after World War 11. It
is a clear and compact summary of
the revolution, and the new material is
both intriguing and illuminating.

The Admiralty Regrets: C. E. T.
Warren and James Benson (Harrap).
The story of the British submarine
Thetis, which, with a complement of
103 men, of whom only four survived,
failed to surface after a diving-trial in
June, 1939. According to the authors
there was a great deal of muddle in the
search- and rescue-operations. After
she was salvaged Thetis was re-
christened Thunderbolt, and, after
many war-time adventures, was eventu-
ally sunk by an Italian warship: this
story is also told. The book is
journalistic in style, with too much
invented dialogue, but remains
extremely interesting.
