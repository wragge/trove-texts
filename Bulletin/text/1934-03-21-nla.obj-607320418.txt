JROM its modest beginning at Camellia, N.S.W., in 1917, with the manufacture
of "FIBROLITE" Building Sheets for walls and ceilings, the "FIBROLITE"
Asbestos-Cement Industry has steadily progressed until it now ranks amongst the
important secondary industries of the Commonwealth. Large works, employing
some hundreds of men, are now in operation at Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, and
additional works are shortly to be erected at Brisbane.
The steady progress of the industry is due largely to public recognition of the permanently
durable and non-corrosive characteristics of " FIBROLITE," together with the sound economy
ensured by its use.
As it can be moulded to practically any shape, "FIBROLITE" is extensively employed in the
manufacture of a wide range of products, the more general of which are shown in the list on
right. Full information regarding any of these products will be gladly supplied on request.
Inquiries are also solicited regarding the use of "FIBROLITE for other purposes.

FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
has real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought, because people want them in their
homes. . - .' V
Tine daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

HIS
BOOKS
The Twin Revolutions
The chief interest of the two latest
books alxiut Russia lies in the indications
they givfe of the way the U.S.S.R. is head-
ing. Anatole de Monzie, author of New
Russia (Allen and Unwin, 12s. 6d.), dedi-
cates his book to Edouard Herriot “in
memory of the telegram of October, 1924,
in which France officially recognised the
U.S.S.R.”
It was appropriate that France should
have been the first to take this step,
since practically all the stages, and
even many of the personalities, of the
French Revolution were duplicated in
Russia. The weak, domesticated Czar
and his brave, indiscreet, pig-headed
Czaritza might have been reincarnations
of Louis and Marie Antoinette. Keren-
sky was Danton in nearly all particulars.
Girondins babbled again in the Duma,
and Montagnards in the Workers and
Soldiers’ Councils. The bourgeoisie who
defeated the 1905 revolution were like
the encyclopedistes. Tschaikowsky, Kro-
potkin and Tolstoi were Rousseaus.
New Russia doesn’t stress these obvi-
ous analogies; but it does stress in a
brilliant first chapter that, just as Loui
XIV. made revolution inevitable in
France, so his contemporary, Peter the
Great, made it inevitable in Russia.
The significance of First to Go Back
(Gollancz: Dymock’s ; 12s. 6d.) is tha
the author, Mrs. Blakeslee, a former fnaid-
of-honor to the Czaritza, has been con-
verted to Sovietism. She was the Coun-
tess Irina Keller, a refugee, is marriec
to an American, and had not been in
Russia for ten years, when she and her
husband got permission to visit it in
1932. Her enthusiasm has been rousec
by the victories of her fellow-country-
men under Stalin in the national field,
just as many emigres of another age be-
came enthusiastic about French nation-
alism under Napoleon.
A French Statesman’s View
Frenchmen have always been fairly
accurate prophets of the way the Rus-
sians would go, for obvious reasons
Rousseau wrote in his “Social Contract”
that Peter, instead of trying to police his
subjects, should have trained them for
war. Rousseau’s friend Condillac saw
danger in Russia’s seeming calm and
patience ; he thought, as Tacitus did, that
such manifestations were always the pre-
cursors of terrific storms. Napoleon fore-
saw an upheaval that would leave Russia
a republic “inside 50 years” ; and it was
not for lack of conspirators and their
mouthpieces (Pushkin, Gogol, Turgue-
niev) that he was 50 years out in his
reckoning.
Just because the French have logical
minds, and have been through periods of
social idealism themselves, they are scep-
tical about the pretensions of Russia’s
new rulers. They see in Soviet Puritan-
ism no more than a revival of their own
Reign of Virtue which ended with
French officialdom a synonym for cor-
ruption. “We are building a new life
which calls for a new man,” wrote Sab-
sovitch, pne of the creators of the Gos-
plan. “The French,” said Robespierre,
“have outstripped the rest of the human
species by 2000 years. They are a species
apart.” Poincare was asked in Novem-
ber, 1930: “What will be the verdict of
the future on the Five-Year Plan?”
“Appalling failure,” he replied. For the
rest Henri Rollin has written:
One may ask if the dreams of indus-
trialisation to the utmost limits, the policy
pursued by the Bolsheviks, will not meet
with the same fate as befel Peter the
Great.,.. Does not Soviet Russia on the
road to industrialisation run the risk of
falling by the wayside, just as Czarist
Russia fell on the road to San Sophia?
If the attempt of the Communist party
(which numbers 1,400,000 members) to
industrialise a nation of 160,000,000
people fails, the peasants, who number
75 per cent., will be to blame. Like the
eighteenth-century French peasants they
have been bilked: they were promised
land, and were given jobs under depart-
mental aristocrats.
But many of them
have been worked
up to a high pitch
of patriotism, and,
like the French
peasants during
the Napoleonic wars, they feel that
the world is against their native land.
War Governments drain away the lives
and energies of workers ; one of the aims
of a Communist Government is to con-
serve proletarian life and energy. The
U.S.S.R. is spending (in millions of
roubles) 89,858 p.a. on social services, a
sum which exceeds the entire national
income. If the Government can go on
the most recalcitrant peasants should
come round in time. But can it go on?
New Russia has been admirably trans-
lated by R. J. S. Curtis.
Change of Heart
Mrs. Blakeslee writes in the bubbling
high spirits of one who revisits the old
home in congenial company. She is a
typical pre-war wife of her class —full of
arch charm —and her husband is repre-
sented as watching her gambols with the
stern, yet adoring, eye of an American
he-man. She takes him everywhere— to
Leningrad and Moscow, to Ukraine and
Northern Caucasus, and as far south as
the Crimea —asking eager questions of
peasants and others, translating the
answers for him, delighted with all she
sees and hears. The changes stagger her
—the clinics, the schools, the housing
schemes, the communal meals, the new
marriage and divorce laws which have
done away with prostitution (“There is
no need for it,” a Communist tpld her
naively. “One gets married instead.”),
the political minds of the children, who,
instead of playing games, hurl solemn
platitudes about Communism at one
another.
It is a melancholy but historically in-
evitable fact that the Soviet achievement
which impressed her most was the army.
It was the army of Napoleon that
made thousands of emigres “neither
Jacobins nor moderates nor royalists, but
Frenchmen”; and a time came when
“The Marseillaise” moved them as much
as the strains of “The Internationale”
moved Mrs. Blakeslee two years ago.
At a gigantic parade of foot, horse,
guns and tanks past Lenin’s tomb her
enthusiasm was communicated to her
husband, who has contributed several
chapters to her book. “We haVe the
strongest army in the world,” a Bolshevik
told him before the parade began, and
he was soon to agree.
Orders ring out. The Red mass is sway-
ing. It swings into action. Straight lines,
eager faces, sharp bayonets, all in perfect
rhythm they begin to pass in review before
us.
“It is beautiful! It is wonderful,” I
shout, my military training getting the best
of me.
It is on the cards that the Russians’
military training may get the best of
them. If so, Europe is likely to experi-
ence far greater sufferings than it did in
the Napoleonic wars.

A Yankee at the Court of King Bluff
Seven years ago The Bulletin set out
to do for the Australian novel what it
had already done for the short story.
Over 500 novels were entered for its
first year’s competition, and of these
about 30 were eventually published
abroad. Exchange, primage, the sales
tax and the tariff came to the help of
local publishers. Australian works be-
gan to attract the attention of England
which previously had refused to believe
we were capable of exporting anything
of merit except wool, cricketers, foot-
ballers, front-line soldiers and an occa-
sional tennis player, billiardist or boxer.
With the exception of a few Americans
(Dreiser, Mencken, Cabell, Nathan) and
one or two Frenchmen such as Maurois
and Cazamian, all the outstanding critics
of contemporary English fiction are
British. John Buchan, Robert Lynd, the
anonymous writers of the “Times”’and
others took a passing interest in the Aus-
tralian renascence. The inevitable hap-
pened : Australian fiction became
“news” and a crowd of imitators pushed
forward. More and more Australian

The Expert Advice of the Technical Editor of
AUSTRALIAN RADIO NEWS
will be yours, free of charge.
A “Bulletin” publication—Every Friday
works were published, and the competent
overseas critics, already overburdened
with the output of their own countries,
began to lose interest. This left the imita-
tors with no one to imitate.
A result which some may regard as
diverting, but which has its tragic side,
may be seen in “Literature in the Anti-
podes,” by C. Hartley Grattan. It
appeared recently in the “New York
Times Book Review.” “The Fortunes
of Richard Mahony” is said to deal “with
an Australia now pretty much passed
into history.” Several otherwise capable
English critics have made this silly re-
mark. The Australia described by H. H.
Richardson hasn’t passed into history: it
never existed. The lady is an admirable
writer, but she knows relatively little of
Australia, and she isn’t in sympathy with
it. She left a Melbourne school for Leip-
zig at the age of 16 and has only been
back for one flying visit since.
The fatuous objection is lodged against
Katherine Prichard’s novels that they
“neglect the cities,” which, Mr. Grattan
knowingly reveals, contain “the bulk of
the population.”
For the rest, he deals at length with
war-books by J. Maxwell and E. J. Rule,
but doesn’t refer to Leonard Mann. He
mentions books by Samuel Griffiths
(also spelt Griffith), “who has followed
the races in Australia, India and South
Africa”; John Truran (“a novel vastly
important to the development of Aus-
tralian fiction”); William Hatfield, Mrs.
Duncan-Kemp and Myrtle R. White.
He ignores F. D. Davison (whose
“Man Shy” has been acclaimed here and
in England as a little masterpiece), Vance
Palmer, Idriess, Cronin, Bridges and
Norman Lindsay, whose boys, as revealed
in “Saturdee,” may be compared with
Booth Tarkington’s, if not with Mark
Twain’s. Helen Simpson, Beatrice Grim-
shaw, Stella Miles Franklin and Jack
and Phil Lindsay are some Australians
in London who don’t seem to have im-
pressed him. This is the turgid jour-
nalese he employs:
Though it [William Hatfield’s “Sheep-
mates”] does not dodge the fact that
drunkenness is a familiar phenomenon in
Australia and gives attention to human
malignancy, the central moral core is of
such a character that to readers bred to
more mature writers the book seems de-
signed for adolescents. This is not the
case, and it has gone through many edi-
tions in Australia, but the circumstance
illustrates the weakness of Australian criti-
cism, for the book carries a laudatory pre-
face by a professor!
Here is a critic who —unlike our pro-
fessors —can’t write grammatical Eng-
lish, and who doesn’t know his subject.
Yet, because Australia is still regarded
as a cultural limitaneus in parts of the
U.S.A., he has been able to bluff his way
into a reputable American paper as an
authority on what he calls “Antipodean
literature”!
H. S.
Citizen of the World
Hervey Allen’s Anthony Adverse (Gol-
lancz ; Dymock’s; 10s. 6d.), which has
become a best-seller all over the English-
speaking world, is a record-breaker for
size. It is divided into nine books, and
covers over 1200 pages. Yet most of it
is supremely interesting.
This story of Napoleonic times is told
with a surprising wealth of detail, and it
is crammed with incident. Anthony
moves quickly from adventure to adven-
ture, but remains a somewhat shadowy
figure. Many of the subsidiary charac-
ters, however, are vigorously drawn.
Here is Napoleon:
A short man with a head a little too large
for his body entered the room. He stopped,
looked. Energy radiated from him like
heat from the sun. Everybody present was
positively electrified by it; swept out of
their own orbit into his. The force came
from the head, from the eyes and under
the brows. To be suddenly faced with it
in the ordinary course of life was equivalent
to opening a cupboard to take down your
hat and finding a cobra looking at you with
its hood spread. The next move would be
with the terrible head. And you knew,
you felt eternally certain, that the head
knew what that move would be.
Anthony is a strange customer. He
has no country, and he dies without know-
ing who his parents were. Left as an
infant at an Italian convent, he stays
there for ten years, hardly knowing there
is a world outside. Another ten years
he spends as the future heir of a Scot-
tish merchant to whom he has been
apprenticed. Then he wanders off to
Havana, to Africa to manage a slave-
trading base, back to Italy, to France,
England and Spain, then to Louisiana, to
a Mexican lazaret, and to a small village
to die. He looks English, he takes an
oath of allegiance to the Spanish king,
and he ends in the service of Napoleon.
He meets and is friends with rich and
poor, saint and materialist; with a Roths-
child and with Juan, with Brother Fran-
<?ois and with Cibo.
There is beauty in the book. Also
ugliness. Above all, there is teeming life.

Thomas Anstey Guthrie, who died last
week at the age of 77, was a regular con-
tributor to “Punch” for more than half
a century. As a playwright he had a
resounding success with “The Man from
Blankley’s,” and he was a scholarly
translator of Moliere; but, like Steven-
son, he will live as the creator of a per-
fect story for boys. “Vice Versa” is as
unforgettable as “Treasure Island.”
This humorist was born in London,
went on to Cambridge, was called to the
Bar in 1880, and abandoned it for letters
in 1882—the year “Vice Versa” appeared.
“The Giant’s Robe,” in 1883, was fol-
lowed by “The Black Poodle,” “The
Tinted Venus,” “The Pariah,” “The Talk-
ing Horse” and others. Some of these are
good, some date, some are thin and
poor in plot; but all have the light,
swift touch, the easy precision of the
artist.
When Anstey was 70 he published the
first of his “free” adaptations of Moliere.
These works, which are known as
“Anstey’s Moliere,” are for the stage
rather than the study. They, so to say,
modernise Moliere in the English idiom,
while retaining his French quality. They
are thus Anstey’s contribution to scholar-
ship in comparative letters.
A considerable man in his way; and
he never advertised.

The Inevitability of War
In his critique of Fenner Brockway's
“The Bloody Traffic” (R.P. 21/2/’34)
“G.D.” repeats the old, old yarn about
mankind’s being “belligerent by nature.”
The myth is long overdue for explosion.
The only human beings who display
belligerency in an intensive form at this
time of day are still at the spear- and
assegai-thro wing stage. Modern man
in the mass is far from belligerent. In
any case, belligerency in general has
nothing to do with declarations of war.
They are usually decided on by a few
elderly people, themselves often the most
nervous of mortals. The fact that almost
every country had to resort to conscrip-
tion during the last war speaks for itself.
As for the volunteers, a questionnaire
among those who joined up would prob-
ably have revealed that about 80 p.c.
went owing to a desire for adventure,
a distaste for being handed white
feathers, or some other reason entirely
unrelated to a desire to fight to the
death with strangers.
The great nations have been at peace
now for 15 years. If for 15, why not for
115 or 1015?
Mankind has adopted the formula that
wars are inevitable. They are at-present,
but mankind’s alleged belligerency has
nothing to do with it.

A Satchel of Books
Holy Wednesday, by Manuel Galvez
(The Bodley Head ; 65.), is both a pro-
found study of religiomania and a pic-
ture of a community (any community,
though the venue happens to be Buenos
Aires) as it appears to a priest in the
confessional. Father Solanas is a saintly
man who loves and sympathises with
erring mortals. He understands others ;
himself he cannot understand, and his
end is tragic. The translation from the
Spanish has been beautifully done by
Warre B. Wells.
Murder in Trinidad, by John W. Van-
dercook (Heinemann; 7s. 6d.). A weak-
ness of this one is that the characters,
though English, talk American, which pre-
sumably is the author’s language. Lynch,
for example, the super-sleuth, says: “I’m
going to my room now and change.” It
is an exciting blend of crime and adven-
ture story which describes deeds of valor
and villainy (not to mention idiocy) in
an almost inaccessible refuge for male-
factors whose ruthless chief is an em-
peror among dope-runners. The boys,
young and old, will love it.
De Vriendt Goes Home (Heinemann ;
7s. 6d.) is by Arnold Zweig, the German
Jew, now in exile, who wrote “Sergeant
Grischa.” It reveals, among other inter-
esting things, that Palestinian Zionism
is muddled. There are patriotic Zionists
(the realists of the movement), and they
are opposed not only by the Arabs but by
patriotic Zionists of other ways of think-
ing, and notably by orthodox Jews to
whom political Jews are revolting out-
casts. Poor De Vriendt is another Ham-
let ; a great and good man beaten by his
contradicting impulses and by life. An
orthodox Jew, he is assassinated as a
national menace by a Zionist; assassi-
nated because, in the words of Irmin, the
English official who revered him, “he had
the courage to defy his race, and tell
them where they were wrong and what
was the matter with them.*’
For the painter who looks sanely at
the Australian landscape and finds in it
the characteristics that endear it to other
honest folk there is not a great deal of
encouragement in this year of grace.
Art in Australia is therefore to be con-
gratulated on devoting its latest number
to the work of Maorilander Robert John-
son, pupil of A. F. Nicoll. There are
six beautiful reproductions of Johnson’s
paintings, on any one of which his repu-
tation as a draughtsman and a painter
might be allowed to rest. Masterly is a
glimpse of Sydney town from the North
Shore, taking in that graveyard of hulks
that lies westward of Ball’s Head. In
this vista is captured the summer haze
that makes the harbor a vision of
romance and all the glory of late-after-
noon sunlight. “Palm Beach” is another
panoramic impression which declares that
Robert Johnson finds Nature beautiful,
and can express the fact without consult-
ing a distorting mirror.
The Standardisation of an Australian
Arithmetic Test, by K. S. Cunningham
and W. T. Price (Melbourne Uni. Press ;
4s. 6d.), is not likely to be widely read.
It has been issued by the Australian
Council for Educational Research. The
authors have been engaged in analysing
the results of arithmetical tests applied to
pupils of all ages in 700 schools and six
States. One moral that arises out of 116
pages crammed with explanations (which
don’t explain much, since the text of the
tests isn’t given) and with algebraic for-
mulae of the sort which revel in the use
of Greek letters, logarithmic curves and
radicals is that there is little, if anything,
to be gained by increasing the time de-
voted to arithmetic beyond “certain
limits.” Figures in the tables speak for
themselves to the same effect. Pity is
that there isn’t a scale of coefficients to
value the aptitude of teachers. Aptitude
of pupils is easy to generalise, as any-
one who has taught for a few years
knows. It may be of value to use cal-
culating machines and analyse examina-
tion • results, but calculating machines
aren’t the beginning of a substitute for
an education system intelligent enough
to reject people who cannot teach.
Gourmet’s Book of Food and Drink
(John Lane; 7s. 6d.) has a number of
amusing decorations in color by Hendy.
If this reliable guide to a good meal has
a defect it lies in his whimsical tendency
to overdo the democratic touch. The
author writes rapturously of a “gorgeous
dish of grilled and buttered kippers”
cooked by a London worker on a shovel
over a bucket-fire, and he has a chapter
on viands such as pigs’ fry and pigs’
trotters. An illustration shows a sand-
wichman gazing at stewed eels —one of
London’s foulest dishes in this food-lover’s
estimation. He indulges in all kinds
of arguable assertions ( e.g “The French
make coffee no better or no worse than
the English”), but he is usually ready to
support them with reasons. “In My
Cups” and “Some Old Recipes” make the
mouth water, and they are also full of
strange information. What is the origin
of “bumper,” for example, and what is
the difference between a bumper and a
brimmer? You can find the answer here,
and also the way to prepare hundreds of
delightful dishes whose ingredients you
may never be able to afford.
Readers of the works of E. Phillips
Oppenheim can always rely on two things
being unimpeachable —the society and the
drinks. In The Gallows of Chance
(Hodder and Stoughton; Angus and
Robertson; 7s. 6d.) Lord Edward
Keynsham sips a glass of port at the
Carlton Club, and then makes a sublime
admission: “I’m not much of a judge
of anything excepting vintage _ wines.”
The heroine calls on the hero, Sir Hum-
phrey Rossiter, K.C. (“the youngest
Home Secretary who had ever filled the
post”), and explains why she is late:
“Don’t laugh at me, please. I to go
to the show at Buckingham Palace.” And
then there is the Marquis de Lusigny.
He claps his hands as a signal to the
maitre d’hotel of the Chateau de Lusigny,
an ancient palace ; and the functionary
sweeps the glasses from the table of the
magnificent dining-room and pours a
wine with “the faint perfume and color
of violets” —Chateau Mouton Rothschild,
1906. Lord Edward, the Marquis and
others are engaged in an illegal, yet not
entirely blameworthy, trade which com-
pels them to rig up a movie gallows near
Keynsham Hall and pretend to hang the
Home Secretary on it. However, all ends
happily, with the Marquis solvent and
Lord Edward still a member of the Carl-
ton. Sir Humphrey, after condoning
several crimes, feels it would be seemly
to retire from politics ; but by way of
compensation he wins the hand of the
Buckingham Palace-frequenter.

THE GOOD OIL.
W. M. Hughes will never figure in the
roll of Major Prophets. Somebody will
present to the proper authorities his
second-reading speech on the Oil Re-
fineries Bill, 1920, and he will fail to
matriculate.
There was need for something to be
done when the bill came forward. The
oil business was obviously controlled
from America, and prices had doubled
in a few years. On the subject of kero-
sene the Inter-State Commission had
made acid remarks about profiteering.
It was to rescue Australia from the
clutches of foreign concerns and to ensure
that she would manage her own oil des-
tinies that Mr. Hughes formed Common-
wealth Oil Refineries. Forty-nine per
cent, of the shares were held by Anglo-
Persian Oil, in which the British Govern-
ment has a large interest; 51 p.c. by the
Commonwealth Government.
The objectives, as set out by Mr.
Hughes, were:
(1) To secure the supply of oil and oil
products to Australian consumers at fair
prices, in lieu of the excessive prices which
have been and are charged.
(2) To provide means of refining any
oil which may be discovered in Australia.
(3) To increase materially the limited
stocks of oil and oil products carried in
Australia and to provide the Navy with a
cheap source of supply which would not be
imperilled in time of war.
He added: —
For the first time the interests of the
consumer will be conserved. We shall no
longer be compelled to take whatever
Standard Oil offers u 5.... For £250,000 we
are offered a partnership in a £20,000,000
company whose experience in much wider
fields absolutely assures success.
Mr. Hughes went ahead with his
scheme. Since then the only greasy com-
modity which has been cheap in Aus-
tralia has been that well-known product
of Royal Commissions the Good Oil,
though at times it has almost had to be
dragged out of its human containers with
tongs. The latest strike of it has been
at the Royal Commission over which Mr.
Lamb, K.C., is presiding. The flow has
had a distinctly pungent odor ; but wells
which Mr. Lamb was expected to tap
have failed to blow.
According to the evidence of Mr. F. B.
Smith “consolidations” have a way of
killing off any growth which eats into the
trade. A case in point was that of Uni-
versal Distributing Co., formed in 1927
to handle between 8,000,000 and
10,000,000 gallons p.a. of Tidewater oil;
the U.D.C. people lost 70 p.c. of their
capital, and 128 Australians were thrown
out of work. It was thought in 1932 that
the Richfield Oil Co. was making head-
way. Suddenly it found itself in difficul-
ties in America, and withdrew from the
Commonwealth, leaving substantial con-
tracts unfulfilled.
This was another of Mr. Smith’s con-
cerns. He told the Commission that
when he sought to get supplies from
big American cos. to fill the hiatus, being
willing to pay cash and abide by their
selling conditions, they would not help
him. He pleaded that he must fulfil an
arrangement with Westralian Farmers, a
co-operative concern with half a million
of capital and 7000 farmer-shareholders.
Two companies, he asserts, did not even
do him the courtesy of giving him a final
answer to his request.
Then he turned to C.O.R. That con-
cern might well have been interested in
someone who said he could make a
wholesale profit of 2d. a gallon on petro*
landed f.o.b. at 5.7 d. (the U.S.A. cost
figure) and marketed at Is. 6d. at pumps.
He offered to provide his own tankage
at Fremantle and pay cash for 2,000,000
gallons p.a. But C.O.R. would have none
of him.
Mr. H. C. Sleigh was at this time being
supplied in the Eastern States. He
quoted Smith for A.-P. products, though
at a price which the other party thought
out of the question. C.O.R.’s reason for
turning Smith down seems to have been
that a continuous market was not
assured, but as the Smith-Westralian
Farmers contract had six years to run
it scarcely seems to hold water. And
presumably Sleigh would not have offered
to do business with Smith unless assured
by C.O.R. of supplies—which he would
have taken past Fremantle to Sydney and
then reshipped to Fremantle. Any objec-
tion to Smith directly must, in view of
the conditions, have been equally valid
in the case of Sleigh.
Westralia was paying 2d. a gallon
more for petrol than the price in
the Eastern States. Smith aimed at
wiping out the difference. But C.O.R.
was adamant. Even when the West-
ralian Farmers’ board travelled to Mel-
bourne to plead it would not budge.
This Anglo-Australian concern in which
the Commonwealth Government is sup-
posed to have a controlling interest has
left the largest Australian State entirely
in the hands of American oil interests.
In ten years C.O.R. has paid only two
dividends —6 p.c. in 1931 and 4 p.c. in
1932. Though its assets never have ex-
ceeded £550,000, to the astonishment of
Auditor-General Cerutty it has had to
write off £519,000 in depreciation. It
controls less than 5 p.c. of Australian
supplies of oil products. Having been
formed to keep prices within reason, it
complains in its last report of the “de-
pressing effects of world competition” on
local conditions, which have forced upon
it “drastic internal economies.”
It would be interesting to hear Mr.
Lyons, who now wears Mr. Hughes’s
cast-off prophet’s robes, on the subject of
C.O.R. and its relation to the general oil
situation. Westralia, too, would no doubt
appreciate a few words from Mr. Pearce
—he introduced the Oil Refineries Bill,
1920, into the Senate with much glowing
rhetoric —on the experiences of West-
ralian Farmers and the general body of
owners of cars and petrol waggons in his
State. He might be given the Perth Town
Hall free to explain to his constituents
why the West sometimes pays 3d. per
gallon more than the East for petrol when
it is so much nearer to a British oilfield
in which Australia has a financial interest.
THE WRANGLING PARTIES.
A “We Don’t Want Bruce” campaign
was launched last week. Mr. P. F.
Loughlin, who became a U.A.P. man by
the same process as the Prime Minister,
fired the first gun at a Goulburn confer-
ence of their new party, and Mr. Lyons
hurried forward in a modest sort of
charge against the danger which threatens
his position.
Mr. Loughlin said all the things which
a mild Lab.-U.A.P. State member might
be expected to say in the bosom of his
new political family about a distinguished
visitor of his own kidney: “Congratu-
lations on the excellent work you
are doing... .rehabilitation of the nation
.... able maintenance of national prin-
ciples .... firm resistance to attacks of
extremists.” Mr. Lyons was in perfect
agreement with Mr. Loughlin. His Gov-
ernment, he said, had “never departed
from its policy.” Unkind people “in
quarters from which criticism was not
expected” had said wounding things;
nevertheless, “true to his trust” and all
that sort of thing—the electors know it
by heart —he was “going right ahead
with the full loyalty of my colleagues in
the Cabinet.” Exactly. Hacks who take
plebiscites of aborigines and solve every
problem by appointing a royal commis-
sion would, if Mr. Lyons were to go, feel
like the shipwrecked sailors when the
bos’n fell off the raft with the ration-
box. It would spell their end as well as
his.
Then came a lot of butter for Mr.
Bruce: —
Mr. S. M. Bruce is a big Australian.
Any newspaper that thinks it is going to
make a catspaw of him is making the big-
gest mistake of its existence I have
never been associated with a more helpful,
more loyal or considerate colleague....
and I regret that his name should be asso-
ciated with the propaganda of to-day.
It is queer how the loyalty of Mr.
Bruce forces itself on Mr. Lyons’s mind
whenever it is proposed that Mr. Bruce
should replace him. When this was sug-
gested last year, Mr. Lyons became in-
stantly moved to elevate his beloved col-
league into a position where he would no
longer be a menace. Now, as the High
Commissioner approaches these shores,
another surge of affection has gone
through Australia’s weakest leader, and
Mr. Bruce is evidently to be hedged with
obligations, the breaking of which might
be designated treason. As Mr. Lyons
had no qualms about leaving his own
leader and the party of which he was a
Parliamentary representative for 22 years,
he is perhaps a little inconsistent.
Mr. Bruce will never allow himself to
be used by any section to the disadvantage
of Australia.
Meaning that he will never let Australia
persuade him that he is a better man
to run the Commonwealth than Mr.
Lyons. It is to be hoped that Mr. Lyons
does not know his Bruce.
The speech of Dr. Earle Page at the
Victorian C.P. conference contains a
fairly exact description of the present
Administration: “the Government of
Missed Opportunities.” The doctor de-
clared that it had “paltered with its pro-
blems and would leave nothing perma-
nent on the Statute Book.” He accused
it of throwing overboard the combined
U.A.P.-A.F.A.-C.P. policy on which it
was elected, including tariff revision to
cut out industry-burdening revenue duties,
extension of inter-imperial trade, State
subdivision and redistribution of powers
and duties, amendment of arbitration
laws and co-ordination of transport
through a Federal Transport Council.
As for its finance:
The Government under-estimated its
revenue by £8,000,000 last year and
£3,000,000 this year. It has an accumulated
surplus of more than £4,800,000. Industry
will not get out of the bog until more of its
load is taken off. Substantial reduction of
income and land taxes and primage would
have a stimulating effect on employment
to a degree almost inconceivable. It would
have rendered unnecessary much of the
proceedings of the Premiers’ Conference,
where the Federal Government abdicated its
leadership.
He might have added that monthly
figures to date show no noticeable re-
duction in any item of expenditure.
The C.P. chief worked amicably with
the Nationalists under Mr. Bruce’s leader-
ship for nearly seven years. The alliance
was fruitful, and it is of the first import-
ance to Australia that it should be re-
newed ; but renewed it never will be
while the U.A.P. is controlled as at
present.
The factional atmosphere in which Mr.
Lyons moved for so many years has
accompanied him into his new surround-
ings. He has made a cordial under-
standing impossible. The Walders and
the Parkhills will not have it. Poli-
tically considered, these persons are
of no consequence, and they should
not be allowed to stand in the way
of an agreement between old allies who
worked together when Mr. Lyons
opposed both. The movement for the
return of Mr. Bruce must go on, and
the move for unity between the parties
must be kept above the level of a pot-
house wrangle. The state of Australia
is still critical, and its ills need drastic
medicine, which will never be adminis-
tered by Mr. Lyons and his even feebler
associates who stump the country shout-
ing self-praise.
UNEMPLOYABLES.
The basis of the A plus B theorem, which
is the basis of the Douglas credit system,
is that the purchasing power distributed
by business is never enough to buy back
the products of business. Nearly all of
Douglas’s opponents deny it. I, while
having no use for his nostrum, admit it.
Every year in every normal community
many businesses fail, and their products
are sold “below cost,” as the saying goes.
In ordinary times this seems to happen in
the case of about 5 per cent, of shops,
factories, farming ventures and so on. It
is a noteworthy fact that, in normal years
and localities, about 5 per cent, of the
inhabitants are unemployed.
During a war there may be no unem-
ployed for a while, and in peace-time
some countries, such as France, may have
to import seasonal labor. But, by and
large, the rule that there is little or no
work for 5 per cent, of the population
has applied in the higher civilisations
for generations.
Before the war, when Britain was ex-
tremely prosperous, nearly 2,000,000
people were jobless. “We’ve got no work
to do-oo!” bands of them used to chant
lugubriously in the streets of the great
cities.
It is an effective answer to the claim
of theorists like Douglas and vote-chasers
like Lang that everybody has a right to
a fixed income from a national dividend,
and that the dividend in question can be
achieved by “changes of financial method
and policy.” Every householder knows
what bosh this is from personal ex-
perience.
Who hasn’t encountered the patheti-
cally incompetent “general”—the well-
meaning young woman who makes a
hash of every domestic duty she takes
on? Or the jobbing gardener with the
fatigue complex who is never engaged
twice in the same place? And they have
their counterparts in every walk of life:
briefless barristers, solicitors without
clients, doctors without patients, sales-
men who can’t hold jobs, farmers who
fail however good the seasons may be.
These unfortunates have no purchasing
power, not because of the malign be-
havior of bankers, but because they are
unable to offer services or products that
anybody wants.
From time to time events happen which
throw natural earners of purchasing
power out of work. Great wars inspire
inventors. Strikes turn the thoughts of
employers to machinery. Wherever
machinery appears it drives men off the
land and out of factories as effectually
as Freetrade did in Britain in the nine-
teenth century. The process has already
begun in Russia. A proportion of those
who are driven to the cities or out of city
jobs by the inventors—for inventors, not
bankers, are the real villains of the
drama —find other niches and again
become earners of purchasing power. As
long as they hold their jobs it doesn’t
matter much to them what currency they
are paid in: during the inflationary
period in Germany it took billions of
marks to pay the weekly salary of a
clerk.
All that immediately concerns the
worker, as a worker, is what he can get
for his money in terms of food, clothes
and the like. So long as he can barter
something—whether it is wheat or
butter, legal or medical advice, or merely
lawn-mowing or bed-making—for the
articles he wants he has no more reason
to fear bankers than honest men have to
fear the law. But his bartering is done
through his national currency; and this
is where he is menaced by the Langs and
Douglases of his day. A ruined currency
means ruined national credit, which
means ruined business. And ruined busi-
ness means fewer people capable of tak-
ing, say, wool in exchange for motor-
cars and trips to the seaside.
Major Douglas was silly enough to
say in Sydney that, if Australia adopted
his plan, it would have no unemployment
in a few months. No nation has ever
had a population of 100 per cent, effi-
cients, and neither Australia nor any
other part of the Empire nor any other
country in the world could pay every-
body £3OO a year irrespective of pro-
duction capacity. What to do with the
unemployables is a problem which no
country has solved, though the Hitlerites
are tackling it in their drastic fashion.
It is not to be solved by any plan for
monkeying with the currency, nor by
creating a caste of State-subsidised un-
employables—a standing army of loafers
living on the workers, and encouraged
to go on doing so by politicians, many
of whom live in the same way.
SECOND DIVVY.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Scotland’s Example.
From J. M. Fowler, who was M.H.R.
for Perth (1901-22):
The reference m the article “Clever Chap,
Menzies!” (B. 7/3/’34) to the national system
of education in Scotland as an argument in
favor of a similar policy for Australia is very
wide of the mark. Scotland, compared with
Australia, is so small that it could be dumped
into any one of the larger States and be lost
altogether unless its presence were indicated,
as some malicious person has suggested, by the
smell of whisky. And the Scottish system of
education was only saved to that country
because it was one of the few public depart-
ments which the Scots at the time of the
Union refused to hand over to the new cen-
tralised authority. It would have been well
for Scotland if more of her State rights had
been retained for her people, who are suffer-
ing badly to-day under the federal system,
dominated by English interests.
The suggestion that a single national educa-
tional authority operating from Canberra would
be more efficient and less expensive is not
borne «out by the federalising of other depart-
ments. The Postal Department, for example.
But the Scotch are not living under a
federal system, and if there is any
domination under the Union the English
are the sufferers. They have to put up
with Scottish Prime Ministers.
Certainly Scotland is a small country
compared with Australia (though it is
much larger than Tasmania), but size is
not the only thing to be considered. Its
population of nearly five millions is
spread over 29,796 square miles of rugged
country, including 186 islands but exclud-
ing 609 square miles of inland water.
In the Highlands and other parts means
of communication are still primitive.
When the national system of education
was established they must have been
dreadful.
It is a national system of education,
by the way. No separate department
and Cabinet Minister (with personal staff)
for Lanark, Midlothian, Fife, Aberdeen,
Renfrew, Angus, Ayr, Dumbarton and
the rest of the 33 counties. And results
have been so good that a national system,
with decentralised administration, might


be worth trying in Australia, especially
as it could be accompanied by a redis-
tribution of taxing powers—income tax
to be transferred to the Commonwealth,
land tax and death duties to the States.
The Postal Department is men-
tioned. A disappointing concern at the
moment, no doubt. Still, does Mr.
Fowler believe that the people would be
better served by six Postal Departments,
each with a Cabinet Minister, and each
Cabinet Minister with a personal staff?
4
The Scheme for Maoriland.
In money matters, Maorilanders seem to
be made of sterner stuff than Austra-
lians ; so, although Major Douglas tried
to satisfy the Shivery Islanders with the
same platitudes and airy nothings with
which he regaled Australia, he did not
succeed. When the Parliamentary Money
Committee politely asked him for his
plans, the gallant Major muttered some-
thing about “inescapable engagements,”
and coolly suggested that the Govern-
ment might hold a judicial inquiry in
London. But -the committee still pur-
sued him —it replied that it would hold a
special meeting to listen to his wisdom
with an open mind, and that it would
even go to the ends of Maoriland to
convenience him, if need be.
Thus cornered, the Major produced his
scheme for Maoriland, which seems to be
different from and inconsistent with the
famous scheme for Scotland. Briefly :
(1) Bank dividends to be limited to 6 p.c.
on subscribed capital, capital “water issues”
to be regulated by Parliament. Every bank
to make an annual sworn statement of
balance-sheet assets and this to be checked
by an independent market valuation of its
assets.
(2) Difference between balance-sheet
valuations and market valuations to be
transferred to a No. 1 suspense account;
that between 6 p.c. dividend level and
actual earnings to a No. 2 suspense
account.
(3) Fifty per cent, of moneys in No. 1
suspense account to be used annually to
reduce customers’ overdrafts; 75 p.c. of
No. 2 suspense amounts to be applied to
reduce or reimburse interest on customers’
overdrafts.
Insurance companies are to be dealt
with in the same way. And all “con-
cealed reserves” are to be “monetised
within the financial system to wipe out
the overdraft of the community.” This,
Mr. Douglas argued, would “increase
purchasing power and ease unemploy-
ment.” But when asked whether his
scheme was not confiscation he re-
marked :
There is an old Spanish proverb that he
who robs the robber earns 100 years’ re-
mission .... This is not my opinion but an
old proverb.... I am not proposing to dis-
possess any man.
Presumably, then, bank shareholders
are not men ; but let that pass. The
scheme is certainly one that Mr. Lang
should hear about. If it had been in
vogue when he was last in office, his path
would have been easy. His Government
would merely have needed to appoint
Mr. Garden as official market-price
valuator, and when he had declared the
assets of the banks at double the balance-
sheet estimate the Treasury could have
grabbed the lot and turned them over
to the peepul. That is, of course, if
there had been any banks left, since
reserves are the fat on which banks live
in lean times, and they had been through
hungry periods before the Hope of
Auburn era.
Nevertheless, the Douglas system
would have disadvantages even for Mr.
Lang. Under it he might not have be-
come a successful house-agent able to
lend just on £14,000 to the “Labor
Daily.”

Exit Jardine.
“El V.”: Jardine may not be England’s
cricket captain this year. He may retire
to the obscurity of his office amid a yell
of triumph from the Hill. It was his mis-
fortune that he was a Scotsman —and a
Jardine. Scotsmen take their play seri-
ously, like Irishmen, and since his main
adversaries were Australians whose blood
is largely Scotch and Irish it was a case
of when Greek meets Greek.
In England games are a pastime ; and,
though Test players are prominent, they
certainly are not numbered among the
nation’s great, nor do they consider them-
selves so. The contrast may be seen by
reference to the “Who’s Whos” of the two
countries. Jardine’s name does not appear
among England’s “40,000 notabilities.”
Neither does that of any other cricketer,
except for some distinction other than
cricket. Hobbs’s entry reads:
Hobbs, Jack; b. 1883. Publications:
“Cricket for Beginners,” 1922; “My
Cricket Memories,” 1924; “Between the
Wickets,” 1926; “Playing for England,”
1931; “The Fight for the Ashes, 1933.
In the Australian volume Bradman
gets a half-column, in which he is desig-
nated “the world’s greatest batsman” as
a preliminary to the setting out of a long
roll of scores.
Whatever his temperament, it must be
conceded that Jardine was a great cap-
tain, and it is to his credit that he mostly
kept his temper and his dignity. Had his
troubles been as between himself and the
Australian Eleven, they might have been
easily smoothed over. But he had the
flapper press to contend with, and the
Hill.
A few years ago I saw and dealt with
Jardine frequently, and found him the
most satisfactory kind of man for a busy
pressman to meet. His “Yes” or “No” was
prompt and frank. His comments were to
the point. He did not exude cigars or
behave like a movie star in search of
publicity, and no Great Journalist of the
flapper press could write:
When I saw my dear old friend Doug
last night he told me in confidence, etc.
Behind his reserve was shyness. He
was, indeed, a typical, lonely Jardine,
like the man who “would not ride” with
Douglas at Otterburn and his Austra-
lian cousins—one was killed at Pozieres,
a private in the 25th. The cousins were
exactly like their better-known relative —
fine, straight chaps, but quite aloof and
fervently loyal to their friends. Suppose
they had taken to cricket and one of
them had become captain of Australia.
1 often wonder what the flapper press and
the Hill would have made of him. I
suspect strongly that he would have been
“a grim, silent Australian bushman, of
the stuff that captured Cape York, re-
lentlessly carrying his country’s flag like
a typical Digger and striking terror into
the hearts of the effete English visitors,
who quailed before his thoroughness.”
And the Hill would have yelled itself
hoarse with glee as his bowlers dotted
Hammond and co. under the jaw.
♦
Young Turks.
In the main street of an Australian city
a Bulletin man once met a Labor poli-
tician, a former disciple of Tom Mann
and a socialist to the finger-tips. He
looked as if the bottom had fallen out
of his world. “What’s wrong?” he was
asked. “Everything,” he grumbled. “You
know I am president of the Inkscatterers’
Union. They have had a dispute with
one of the bosses. He wanted to settle
it, and I was willing ; but those Young
Turks wouldn’t have it.”- “Young
Turks?” “Yes, a parcel of lads led by
that blasted McDoodle. He was break-
ing his silly young neck to have a strike,
and now he’s got one, and the Lord only
knows how we’re going to wriggle out
of it.”
Years afterwards, the same pair met
in another city. “Remember that Ink-
scatterers’ strike?” the pressman said.
“Don’t I?” the politician replied. “Idiotic
affair, wasn’t it?” “What became of
McDoodle?” “McDoodle? Oh, he’s on
a great wicket. Pulled out of the game
and got a job in an importing business.
Now he owns the concern and sits behind
a solid bank account. And there’s no
crustier Tory in captivity. Head of the
local Nationalist organisation, and de-
mands that all Reds should be deported.”
McDoodle came back to memory the
other day when the “Argus” published
a hot denunciation of “the blasphemy
and disloyalty of ‘Farrago,’ the weekly
newspaper of the students of the Univer-
sity of Melbourne.” “This generally dis-
reputable journal” put forth a leading
article, intended particularly for fresh-
men. It genially reminded the fresher
that so far from being “a simple-souled,
clean-minded, fresh-faced public-school
boy,” he is “pimply of face and foul in
thought and word, if not in deed.” It
recommended him to clear his mind of
cant, and to try to obtain “a more real-
istic outlook on conceptions as fallacious
as that of the bold knight and the chaste
maiden.”
Intelligently inquire into the meanings of
the vague unquestionables, the Holy Ghost,
King and Country, marriage, etc. You may
feel that Christianity to-day means to the
bulk of the people exactly what beer means
to others, something to be imbibed on Sun-
days. Culture will appear as it really is;
the swotting up of other people’s opinions
by a few Arts students patriotism as
merely something used to stir up the great
bulk of the people to murder and be mur-
dered for the business interests of a few.
There was a lot more, but there is no
need to go on. A great many young
fellows think like that. All but a few
grow out. of it in time. Their elders, with
few exceptions, regard such ebullitions
with tolerance, remembering (perhaps
with a sigh) what devils of fellows they
were at the same age. The “Argus” is
one of the exceptions. At the beginning
of the century it had the mild Findley
expelled from the Vic. Legislative Assem-
bly for having been concerned, as printer
of a “Tocsin,” in the republishing of what
it described as a Foul Libel on the King ;
and it has never weakened. No parley
with treason! The young shavers on
“Farrago” have published “a blasphem-
ous, disloyal and coarsely-expressed
article, disgusting to the majority of
normal-minded students.” Away with
them!
Yet, as likely as not, the perpetrator
of the article will be an “Argus” leader-
writer some day. Possibly even the editor
of the “Argus” was a bit of a Yohng
Turk in his time.

Bond Companies.
Forestry and similar investment con-
tracts, generally known as bonds, are
agreements by a limited company to do
certain things in return for cash. You
pay your money, hope that the salesman
doesn’t take more than 25 p.c. for selling
the bonds, and look forward to a rich
return 10 or 20 years hence, as per the
prospectus. If it doesn’t arrive there are
no remedies. Your solicitor didn’t draft
the conditions of the bond, and there is
no regulating legislation.
The astonishing number of bonds sold
over the past decade is due largely to the
psychological reception given by the
public. Each bond is supposed to repre-
sent a certain area of land planted with
something; though the plantations are
undivided, and the bondholder has no
legal rights over any particular block, in
his mind’s eye he is persuaded that he
has. Country people may know little
about shares, but they are conversant
with share-farming ; and bonds seem to
have something of that principle about
them.
Actually, in law, bonds are one of the
most complicated forms of investment.
A shocking example of what can happen
when the parent co. is forced into liqui-
dation was given in Sydney last year
when the case of Anzil Hempland Bonds
came before the Courts. In that case
the land had been mortgaged over the
heads of some bondholders, who were
left with practically nothing. In Maori-
land the legal position of bondholders as
joint landholders is doubtful. More than
a certain number of people cannot jointly
hold unsubdivided land in M.L., and
there are likely to be complications.
In any case, the whole system of finance
is too cumbersome, and a start has been
made with turning bonds into shares.
Timberlands Woodpulp has already done
this ; N.Z. Perpetual Forests is still con-
sidering. These cos., and others, would
have come in for a lot less criticism if
shares had been issued in the first place.
Back to Rome.
Mr. Weaver, the N. S. Wales Health
Minister, was born out of his age. He
should have been a Roman emperor,
presiding over the Seven Days of Mirth,
waiting at table on electors in bathing
suits (the Romans appeared at the Satur-
nalia in undress), and regulating the bread
and circuses and gambling tickets which
were issued on a more and more lavish
scale as the old Empire went downhill.
It is certain that Mr. Weaver would
have made a great emperor by con-
temporary standards; for, where the
Romans made lotteries legal only during
the week of annual rejoicing, Mr. Weaver
likes them legal all the time. While, at
the Roman Christmas season, only slaves
and houses were the prizes (though Helio-
gabalus met every taste and humor with
rewards which ranged from a golden
bowl to six dead flies), Mr. Weaver
would give us a million pounds.
He thinks, as he said the other day,
that £5OOO for ss. 3d. is insufficient
temptation to the working (and workless)
men and women who form the bulk of
the lottery gamblers; hence the bigger
amount, which represents well on towards
£2 per household in N.S.W. per week.
Of course, some people may suggest that
a lot of the money would come from
other States where purchase of tickets in
the N.S.W. lottery would be illegal, and
it would be unthinkable to imagine that a
Minister of the Crown would openly
countenance that. If he does, he should
not remain a Minister.
Mr. Weaver, fortunately, is at logger-
heads with the rest of the N.S.W. Cabinet,
honest, unimaginative fellows who do not
seem to have the vote-buying complex
so strongly developed as he has ; but the
Health Minister has the support of that
section of the press which has its lot-
tery policy managed for it by Golden
Jest promoters and the like. Time was
when a Minister who publicly disagreed
with the Cabinet on important items of
policy would have resigned and gambled
on his fate as a private member; but
no political lotteries for Mr. Weaver! He
attacks Cabinet policy in the press, which
is against practice and precedent; he
remains in the Cabinet, backing his fate
both ways. i
Next time he has a birthday, somebody
should give Mr. Weaver a history of the
lottery craze in England.

Pensions for Ever.
The unhappy experiences of President
Roosevelt over this year’s pension appro-
priations should be a lesson in modera-
tion to Australian legislators. They won’t
interest England because she was forced
to deal with the question when New Hol-
land was only a pup.
Pensions are one of the livest poli-
tical questions in U.S.A., and when
anybody tries to tamper with them some-
thing blows up. Congress this year
revived an ancient scheme to give Great
War veterans —nearly three-fourths of
whom never heard a shot fired—a gift of
£440,000,000 in appreciation of their ser-
vices. Instead of rushing to consummate
the vote-buying, Mr. Roosevelt sat back
in the traces hard and even cut
£70,000,000 off the general pension appro-
priation.
He will feel the reaction at the next
election because any family which has
been in the U.S.A. a couple of genera-
tions and hasn’t got a Government sub-
sidy for past services is scarcely respect-
able.
Annual pension payments are in the
vicinity of £50,000,000, apart from the
World War veterans, who are covered by
about three billion pounds’ worth of
Government insurance. There are still
well over 35,000 men of the Civil War,
which finished in 1865, on the pension
list, along with 154,000 Civil War widows ;
and the tiny Spanish-American show left
193,000 soldiers and 33,000 widows who
are still able to collect. The Indian Wars
and the Mexican War in the ’forties still
pay pensions to somebody, and there were,
a year or two ago, eight widows of vet-
erans of 1812 to whom the comic-opera
series of campaigns against Britain con-
tinued to be worth something.
The Civil War Pension Bill, which, 15
years after the affair finished, cost the
country only £6,000,000 per annum,
to-day sets the Treasury back £28,000,000
a year, while if the U.S.A. could fight
another Spanish-American disturbance
every year it would be cheaper for the
taxpayers than finding the present
£25,000,000 per annum which goes to its
decaying heroes and their dependants.
War pensions and war hospital minis-
trations have altogether cost Uncle Sam
£3,500,000,000. But it won’t look much
when the World War veterans really go
into action at the polls in a few years’
time.

Adam Was a Gardener.
The Governor of N. S. Wales seems to
be a man of many yearnings. A few
days ago at Cessnock he expressed his
pride at being taken for one of the
crowd ; now he has told a horticultural
society that his dearest ambition is to be
taken for a gardener.
Being a gardener is not a bad thing.
Usually he is paid so modestly that he
does not shrink from the sight of the
postman. Governments give him tax-
money—family-endowment, for instance
—instead of taking it away from him. He
regards the income tax as merely a name,
and it doesn’t matter to him whether
Lyons or Lang is in power so long as he
gets good seed and the hose keeps run-
ning. He has his privileges, too. No-
body, for instance, expects a gardener
to do what he is told ; and if he gives
an uncivil answer it is put down to his
sturdy nature bred of frequent intakes
of blood and bone.
It might, indeed, be good for both the
Governor and for a few big Australian
cities if King George’s overseer on the
N.S.W. job were to realise his ambition.
He himself, as he says, would enjoy it,
and his views on the shockingness of
the landscape layout of the big cities only
lack a few adjectives to make them ade-
quate. If Sir Philip, properly shabby,
could be induced to frequent suitable
open spaces in the paths of local aider-
men he might (beside raking in a neat
little sideline of tips to reward his
courtesy) be able to pour great truths into
the proper municipal ears and then, re-
vealing himself dramatically at the right
moment, seal the.certainty that his ideas
would be carried out, and make a lot of
dignitaries happy in their memories of
vice-regal contact.
There are other fields, too, in which
he might do good work along the same
lines. What beneficent results, for in-
stance, might accrue if a Unity Confer-
ence could be induced to mistake the
gentle air marshal for Mr. Lang!

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Carliol”: “From now on,” said Arch-
bishop Mowll last week, “I will lose the
name of which I have become so proud
and become Howard Sydney” ; and his
Grace added that he would be equally
proud of his territorial designation. In
England the signatures of many bishops
have a pleasant touch of the archaic, such
as “Dunhelm” for Durham, and “Petri-
burg” for Peterborough. There is only
one known instance of the territorial de-
signation being amended. That was when
an embittered satirist projected the fol-
lowing (or something very like it) at the
Primate of All England:
The Church has oft puzzled and set us a-sCoffin’
By signing C. Ebor, J. Sarum, Will Roffen.
But the Archbishop now no expounder will
want,
For his Grace signs his own proper name—
Thomas Cant.
“Cant” was altered to “Cantuar.”

“Bush Cat”: The Melbourne lorry-
driver who anchored his team with a
“Sure you know about any bad habits your boy might have?”
“I ought to. I taught him all he knows.”
561 b. weight (B. 21/2/’34) could have
known little of the risks he was taking,
One of my rottenest recollections is of
the time I tied the bridle reins of a nice
bay gelding, which I had just taken from
the breaker, to a similar weight while I
attended to a windmill. The prad dragged
it with ease. Brought back and soothed,
he was soon off again; this time he
broke into a gallop, with the weight
swinging in such a manner that I could
foresee the broken leg before it actually
happened. I finished my mustering on
foot while a mate went home for a rifle.
It makes me shudder to think of two
horses in a trolley bolting with such an
impediment in (say) Flinders-street.

“Lord Luvus”: M. Ferri-Pisani, a
representative of “Gringoire,” describes
the different political parties at Canberra.
Externally, he says, it is impossible to
tell to what party a member belongs, but
you soon learn to tell a Labor member
by his horny handclasp. This is true, but
M. Ferri-Pisini is in error in ascribing
it to a party rule compelling every Labor
leader to qualify by engaging in manual
work for two or three years. Such a rule
does not exist. Horny-handedness in a
Labor politician is certainly de rigueur,
but it is produced by artificial means,
such as rubbing the palms against the
columns of Parliament House, washing
the hands frequently in hard water or
rubbing caustic soda into the skin. After
this preliminary preparation half an hour
on the bowling-green is sufficient to keep
the hands suitably calloused. Some fana-
tics of the party go further and do some
useful work in their spare time, such as
laying bricks ; but this sort of eccentri-
city is frowned on by the more moderate
members.
* * * *
“Junda Khan”: Mount Gambier
(S.A.) has been treated to the rather un-
usual spectacle of the Mayor, dressed
in Arab robes, riding down the main
street on a camel. His Worship wasn’t
doing it for a bet; he was leading a pro-
cession, to raise funds for the local
Tourist Promotion Association. Behind
him rode a local solicitor, dressed even
more modishly in an Egyptian fez and
other raiment in fitting with the part.
The string was completed by three other
camels, their riders (association officials)
also garbed in Oriental splendor.

“Mako”: I arrived on my first visit
to Rotorua, M.L., while the thermal dis-
trict was passing through an unusually
quiescent period. My neighbor at the
boarding-house table, a stout gentleman
from overseas, voted it a tame resort for
a holiday, especially for one like himself
who had travelled widely in regions where
earthquakes and volcanic upheavals were
frequent; the modest rumblings and
tremblings of M.L.’s star region left him,
we gathered, entirely cold. That after-
noon the cry “Pohutu plays!” was flashed
round the town, and the entire populace
dashed by car, ’bus or afoot to Whakare-
warewa to see the great geyser perform,
after which sundry smaller geysers did
their bit. My stout friend was among
the onlookers. His manner that even-
ing was slightly subdued. It became
excited when the crockery began to rattle
during dinner and the house swayed,
When he heard there was no train for
Auckland until next day he rushed franti-
cally around in a fruitless quest for a car
to take him per road to more stable
ground. He was not on view during a
somewhat nerve-racking evening, but it
was reported at midnight that a plump
and perturbed gentleman was sitting on
his luggage on the lawn in a chill drizzle,
He was joined at intervals by other fear-
ful souls, and in the early dawn a be-
draggled little procession started for the
station. My neighbor was in the lead.
LOVER: “Blast her old man!
Wish he’d croak!”
“J.”: Brevity can be more
than the soul of wit. Some
years ago at a Q. Circuit
Court the Judge charged the
jury in 17 words. He said:
“The fowl was there, the
accused was there, the fowl
was gone and the accused was gone.”
Then the accused was “gone”—a million
—with the jury.

“L.A.S.”: The doorkeeper of a North
Queensland s.-p. and hazard school the
other day tiptoed into the big room and
said softly. “Keep quiet for a minute
or two, you fellows. There’s a copper
at the counter. No, he isn’t making
trouble ; he’s only making a bet!”

“Cazan”: “J. 8.” includes German
sailors’ hatbands among his treasured
Emden relics (B. 28/2/’34). The Emden] s
prisoners—we took approxi-
mately half of them aboard
troopship A 5 at Colombo—-
did a brisk trade in their
“props” with souvenir-
hunters, but the number of
Emden capbands and badges
sold in Australia in 1915
would almost have supplied
the Kaiser’s navy. Some in-
genious members of the
A.I.F. who were sent back
from Egypt had copies made
and sold them at fancy prices.
One who later rejoined our
unit in France under a new
name—he was a good front-
line soldier —told me he had
sold hundreds of fake badges
and capbands at five bob a
set.

“Tui”: Tasmanians have
no grievance in hearing their
territory referred to as the
“Speck” compared with that
felt by the Maorilanders
when they first arrive in
Sydney and find themselves
greeted as “Pig Islanders.”
How the term, which seems
largely to be confined to
Sydney, came into the Aus-
tralian language seems to be
a mystery, though I have
heard vague references to
Captain Cook and his intro-
duction of pigs to M.L. Need-
less to say, the designation is
never heard the other side of
the Tasman, it being one that
no amount of explanation can
make acceptable to Maorilanders.
* * * *
“Findy”: “Bogaduck’s” reference to
Wirths’ elephant and the piecart (B.
14 /3 / ’34) reminds me of an incident I
witnessed some years ago at Fowler’s
Bay (S.A.). A very much pre-war model
Argyll car was dumped on the jetty by
the coastal steamer, and a shunting horse
was hitched to it. At the first pull the
old auto shot forward and struck Dobbin
in the rear. He plunged forward, the
car again butted him, and they set off
down the narrow jetty in a series of jerks
and jolts. Fortunately someone leaped
up and shut the engine off, whilst an-
other seized the frightened animal’s head.
Otherwise both horse and motor would
probably have swum ashore.
* * * *
“Kariah”: The hat-wearing habit may
occasionally be productive of accidents
(B. 14/3/’34), but permit me to cite a
case on the other side. A mem-
ber of Sydney’s Lidless Union stopped
to stare skywards at a droning ’plane.
Without the protection of a hatbrim
his eyes caught the full force of
the summer sun. The resultant tem-
porary blindness caused him to stumble
on to the roadway, and, not seeing the
warning hand of the policeman on point
duty, he attempted to cross the street.
The constable moved to apprehend the
offender, and, with this authority re-
moved, waiting pedestrians dashed across.
In a moment the most hopeless traffic
jamb had eventuated. As a result of
the pernicious habit of going hatless,
seven pedestrians had their names taken,
many more their toes trodden upon, and
three ladies heard words which they now
know are used by policemen whose
patience has reached snapping point.
* * * *
“D.E.”: Within the last couple of
months the press has enriched my mind
with some remarkable information on
the subject of twins. I read first that an
American had got a divorce from his
wife, who had presented him with a pair,
on the ground that one infant wasn’t his.
I smiled incredulously as I pasted the
cutting in my scrapbook, but a week or
two later a similar case, with a tragic
ending, came to light in N. S. Wales. The
wife of a Tumut farmer who had borne
eight children confessed to her lord after
making the number 10 that one of the
twins had another father; then she
drowned herself and the child. Now
comes a report from Scotland, vouched
for by a member of the House of Com-
mons, that the wife of an islander gave
birth to a twin in Scarp and another at
Stornoway, 48 miles away and 48 hours
afterwards. A man never knows what
he’s in for these days.
* * * *
“Straytelase”: A recent paragraph
touched, a trifle scornfully, on the wear-
ing of corsets by the officers in certain
British regiments. But it should be re-
membered that a generation or two ago
uniformity of figure was considered a
military necessity. I was intended for the
army, and right from my schooldays was
obliged to wear stays —not mere body
belts, but articles well stiffened with
whalebone and tightly laced at the back.
Later I was sent to a German military
college (this was 30 years ago) and there
1 boarded in a barracks with many more
cadets. Practically every young fellow
was as rigidly laced as any lady of
fashion. It was taken for granted as being
part of the uniform, and anything in the
way of ridicule would have called for a
sudden settlement with swords. The
point is that because a man wears a
corset under his shirt he. needn’t be con-
demned as a sissy. When one sees so
many round-shouldered, slump-backed
young men around the streets it might
almost be argued that a return to corsets
for men would be beneficial.
JOE’S JOB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Bruce is a big Australian and a loyal col-
league who will never allow himself to be used
by any section to the disadvantage of his country.’’
— Mr. Lyons.
Shoulder to shoulder firm we stand
In mutual trust and amity.
He’ll never stoop to plunge our land
In sudden, dire calamity.
Who thinks he’d do Australia hurt
Defames him and traduces;
Emphatically 1 assert
That’s not the sort that Bruce is.
The ties of camaraderie
Have fastened well and truly us;
He’ll never play the part to me
That Brutus played to Julius.
Not all the tea that China grows
Or silk that in Japan is
Could ever range him ’rnong my foes.
That’s not the kind that Stan is.
They’re spreading tales that poor old Joe
A well-intentioned messer is;
They’re hinting that he s<?on must go,
Whoever his successor is.
They growl I’ve done my little dash
And scoff at my excuses
For this or that appalling hash—
That’s not the sort that Bruce is.
They tire of me, the fickle mob,
And, sinking to mendacity,
Insinuate I’ve grabbed a job
Too big for my capacity. .
To see some colleague jump my claim
Their constant plot and plan is.
It cuts me to the heart, their game....
I thank my stars, though, all the same,
That’s not the kind that Stan is!

“Vestryman Once”: Judging by reports
of the enthronement of Archbishop
Mowll at St. Andrew’s Cathedral, Sydney,
they’ve made a lot of changes in the Book
of Common Prayer since the days when I
carried round the plate. I’ve never seen
an archbishop ordained, but have been
present at the consecration of a whole
raft of bishops (as Mark Twain would
say). In my prayer-book there’s nothing
requiring any priest, much less a bishop-
or an archbishop-elect, to knock on a door
before he can get into church. In my
day the bishop-elect had to promise
obedience to the archbishop. In the case
of an archbishop-elect that oath was
omitted. The archbishop, or “the bishop
appointed,” put eight questions to the
candidate for episcopal or archiepiscopal
rank, but they dealt only with matters of
doctrine and good behavior, not with
the “constitution of the Church.” The
last question was: “Will you show your-
self gentle and be merciful for Christ’s
sake to poor and needy people, and to
all strangers destitute of help?” I hope
they don’t leave that out nowadays.

“Gentle Joe”: Grandma, 96, a great
pianist Qnce, but as deaf as a post these
last ten years, discovered the other day
that she could hear the radio. Don’t
know whether it’s a peculiarity of
our set, but, anyway, she can hear
music again when we get the buttons
twisted exactly the right way. She
can’t listen very long—she gets too
excited’ and fatigued—but her comments
on the pianoforte classics as now per-
formed are pointed. She says the players
have the phrasing all wrong. The other
“Why has your love degener-
ated to a figure of
speech?”
“Why have you degenerated
to no figure and all
speech?”
night she was all agog to hear an orches-
tral composition by a former pupil of hers
—he deserted the piano for the fiddle and
was later reported to be studying the
’cello. It was announced all right, but
just as the oboes started a dull, low
moaning the station’s electrical equip-
ment went phut and we were treated to
a machine-gun fire of percussive noises.
Grandma sat up very straight. “Write to
him at once,” she said to me, “and tell
him I didn’t like it. You can score for
fiddles or ’cellos or bassoons, but a com-
poser who uses packets of crackers is
just a plain fool.” “It is static,” I
scrawled on a piece of paper. “No, it
isn’t,” snapped Grandma; “it’s Willie
Thompson trying to be cleverer than
Stravinsky.”
* * * *
“Idle Imp”: Many Brisbane Hebes
would be stumped if asked for a
“schooner” (B. 21/2/’34); the Sydney
“pot” has come into almost universal use
in Bananaland. But how many Aussies
have ever heard of a Wanganui? Even
in Maoriland they are falling into dis-
use, but there are a few hardy veterans
who, sinking their full measures, glance
with scorn at the consumer of a modest
half-Wanganui.
* * * *
“Jackaburra”: That Tasmanian Act
which widens the meaning of “potato”
to include other vegetables (B. 21/2/’34)
is beaten a furlong by the Queensland
Sugar Acquisition Act. King Theodore,
when he passed it, made “sugar” include
everything animate and inanimate, his
precedent being an old measure which
declared the dingo a marsupial. How
far the Act can stretch is illustrated by
the story of how Johnny Mullan,
Attorney-General, outwitted the Coor-
paroo Race Club, which wanted to stage
night racing. Johnny said he wouldn’t
allow it. The club replied that it wasn’t
going to let a mere Cabinet edict inter-
fere with its sacred obligations to the
punting public; and forthwith it adver-
tised a meeting. A population sophisti-
cated by many years of King Ted’s rule
awaited the outcome eagerly. On the day
before that fixed for the gala opening of
the new sport, Johnny acquired the whole
of the electric-light fittings and appurten-
ances on the Coorparoo racecourse under
the Sugar Acquisition Act.
* * * *
“Grien”: The Chief Protector of Abo-
rigines in Westralia has been waxing
righteously indignant over an article in a
Los Angeles newspaper dealing with
cannibalism among natives in the north-
ern part of the State. It contained a
vivid account of a horrible banquet with
details as to the disposal of the joints
•and an assurance that the flesh of white
men is held in particularly high regard.
The authority appears to have been a
missionary, who has defended himself
on the plea (1) that he got the informa-
tion from natives; (2) that no harm is
done by spreading the truth; and (3)
that it shows the necessity for supporting
missions. It isn’t much of a defence,
considering the gravity of the delin-
quency. Cannibalism, no doubt, was
practised in the past by Australian natives
—and under stress of starvation still is
—but that the practice was ever
widely spread or an established custom is
in conflict with all we know of a dying
race. In any case, it would be obviously
less likely in the north, where native game
and food are more abundant than else-
where, than in any part of the continent.
* * * *
“Wodgil”: A Perth jury has acquitted
Mahommed Bux (B. 14/3/’34), who went
to the Carnarvon police and demanded
to be arrested on a murder charge, hav-
ing, he declared, shot an Afghan at
Lawlers 15 years ago. The only evi-
dence against him was his own story,
and this he retracted at the trial, explain-
ing that he had made it up because he
was ill and thought he would take a
rest-cure in Carnarvon prison. The Crown
"Dad, I won a prize at school to-day.”
“What for, son?”
“Teacher says for gen’ral deficiency.”
law authorities grumbled that he could
have got his rest-cure without putting
them to so much trouble and expense.
* * * #
“Selma”: I noticed a small green frog
lurking in the window of a Darlinghurst
mixed business, and told the
proprietor. “Oh, he’s always
there,” was the comfortable
reply. “We tried to catch
him the first day we spotted
him, but as at least a dozen
people came in to tell us
about him we decided to let
him stop as a draw.. He
brings business all right.' Eat?
Nothing as far as we
But as he looks fat and con-
tented we don’t worry.
* * *
“Tiny”: The publicity de-
partment of the N.S.W. Gov-
ernment made a ludicrous
blunder when, in connection
with the cheap loans offered
to builders, it decorated the
tramcars with posters depict-
ing roof-tilers working left-
handed. Roofing tiles are
made for use by right-handed
mechanics ; the covering must
be started in the right-hand
bottom corner and finished in
the top left. Slating is
carried out the same way, and the essen-
tial part of a roof-slater’s kit cannot be
used by a left-handed man. Hence the
trade is taboo to the molly-hander.
* * * *
“Pawang”: A somewhat cryptic cable
from Budapest announces the formation
of a dwarfs’ defence union, whose plat-
form demands a law prohibiting mar-
riage between dwarfs and normal people,
amongst other things. The dread of
mixed marriages is due to the fact that
dwarfism is a regular profession in Hun-
gary, and dates back to the times when
potentates kept deformed human beings
in the same way that Potts Point
ladies keep extraordinary-looking dogs.
Dozens of troupes go out from the Hun-
garian Lilliput every year. Some have
visited Australia. A few years ago one
of the midgets gave birth to a baby
while in Melbourne —a normal-sized
infant. The almost truculent tone
of the dwarf leader’s manifesto is
characteristic of the Lilliputians, who
have a marked superiority complex. They
are much keener-witted than the gener-
ality of giants, and are the proud pos-
sessors of a poet ancestor —Philetas, of
Cos. Philetas was tutor to one of the
Ptolemies, and was so small that he had
to carry weights to escape being blown
off his feet.
* * * *
“A.J.S.”: I think I may be able to
throw some light on the “forty 'Austra-
bans, seven feet high,” mentioned in Link-
later’s “Magnus Merriman” as having
been immured in the guardroom of Edin-
burgh Castle. In 1917 I was stationed at
a command depot on Salisbury Plain
where there were some thousands of
“light-duty” men. One of the “light
duties” was to furnish escorts for
a.w.ls. and other transgressors appre-
hended in the U.K. Daily requisi-
tions were received for one or two
backsliders, but one morning there
came an order for an escort for 25 n.c.os.
and men in custody at Edinburgh. Two
sergeants and 25 men were sent north-
wards to take charge of the malefactors.
Four or five days later the whole party
reported back at the Plain, and the
accompanying army forms showed that
in every case the offence was ‘‘Failing to
salute an officer.” Apparently the Aussie
A.P.M. had been marching round the
town with a couple of “Jacks” a few
yards in his rear, who promptly “clinked”
any unfortunate neglecting to throw the
officer a dinkum salute. None of the
bag was an a.w.1., and next , morning at
orderly-room a compassionate C. 0., after
a mild admonition, restored the balance
of leave wasted in clink and journeying,
and gave the men fresh railway war-
rants. That A.P.M.’s little joke must
have cost Australia a tidy sum.
* * * *
“Science III”: I enjoyed Harold
Mercer’s yarn (B. 7/3/’34) about his
friend Biggar’s successful political fight,
but I cannot bring myself to believe that
the supporters of Parsons, the Labor can-
didate, would have deserted him in a body
and voted for Biggar merely because he
had cleared out on account of some shady
transaction. A modern mob leader plus
a competent emissary or two would
have hastened to the spot and bel-
lowed that Parsons was the victim
of a vile, vicious libel such as could
only have emanated from the sewer-
like minds of his corrupt, capitalistic
opponents, whose every thought was filth
and offal. He would have sworn that
there was a hideous plot on foot to de-
stroy Parsons’s political and personal repu-
tation, and would have assured the free
and enlightened that it would only be a
matter of hours before the slandered one
emerged from smoke and triumphantly
proved his innocence of the foul charge.
After that the leader and his cobbers
would have been cheered like mad, and
Biggar and Foodie would have finished
down the field.

Our shots are meant to warn, not kill —
A cautionary measure;

We’ve no desire to raise your ire.
Your men?.... We like and trust ’em.
So don’t misread a playful deed:
It’s but our Bolshie custom.
The bombs we drop from day to day
May quite destroy your cities,
Your citizens in thousands slay;
If so, a thousand pities!
Our guns, you know, aren’t just for show,
And long disuse may rust ’em;
When we commence take no offence—
It’s just our Russian custom.
The gas we send in reeking clouds
(Most glorious of inventions!)
We only use to spread our views,
And not with bad intentions.
Our bayonets we may fix, ’tis true,
And in your innards thrust ’em.
Be not afraid, confused, dismayed:
It’s merely ancient custom.

POLITICAL POINTS
Walter Lee becomes Premier of Tas-
mania again, McPhee having retired, and
he has taken into his Ministry Neil
Campbell, one of the members for Wil-
mot. Lyons is gratified, for he has had
to reckon with the possibility that the
new Minister might ask Wilmot to trans-
fer him from State to Commonwealth
politics ; and Campbells and Camerons
are awkward customers to beat.
Archdale Parkhill, after inspecting the
London Post Office, said he was “a great
admirer of British methods,” many of
which had been “copied in Australia.” It
would be interesting to learn whether
Britain has been moved to copy any of
Parkh ill’s methods. With a clean start
such as our system had, we should be
well ahead of English conservatism, but
the only things in which we excel are
red tape and postal extravagance.
McPhee’s retirement from politics may
cost his party a seat in Denison at the
general election. He topped the poll
in May, 1931, and his surplus enabled
the Nats, to capture four of the six seats.
In the ex-Premier’s absence they are un-
likely to do it again.
Mattaboni, the Italian barman, has
been acquitted of the manslaughter of
the Kalgoorlie fireman whose death after
the fight they had led to the anti-Italian,
anti-Greek and anti-Slav riots. A Perth
jury was satisfied that it had been a fair
fight. A Melbourne newspaper’s version
was that the fireman had been “mur-
dered by a foreigner.”
Mr. Lyons’s press-agent announces
that in response to “urgings” the P.M.
will shortly visit Westralia.
A cordial welcome awaits him, the inci-
dents which occurred last March having
been due to the hectic strain of the seces-
sion campaign. Westralians are anxious to
make the amende honorable for any mis-
conceptions of Westralian hospitality which
he may have gained last year.
Perhaps the citizens will carry out the
ceremony in the old French form—in
bare feet with halters round their necks.
The sorry business of sending Queens-
land wheat abroad, to compete with the
produce of the four States growing wheat
for export which is shut out of the
Queensland market, has resulted in the
State Wheat Board getting Is. 7d. a
bushel, less its own charges. The board,
though responsible for the fool innova-
tion, will not have to meet the loss; that
falls on the growers, who were not con-
sulted.
In the reduction of S.A.’s Federal elec-
torates from seven to six, Angas is to
disappear. The people will lose a
doughty opponent of squandermania if
Gabb, the member, can’t find another
seat. They could better spare many a
party hack.
Sydney City Council expects to lose
£384,000 on resumptions this year. It
amounts to 2d. in the £ of the rate struck,
4|d. in the £. In the boom years the aider-
men resumed properties in a hilarious
spirit and paid fancy prices for them,
borrowing the money for the most part.
The Municipal Labor party throws all
the blame on the brutal bondholders.
Bruce will be in Australia this week.
He says that on his return journey to
England he will visit Canada for ten
days. A little previous, perhaps. Aus-
tralia may have something to say before
he continues his travels.
Hitler’s new group system will cause
smiles in places like Moscow’s Red
Square, Sydney’s Goulburn-street and
Turbot-street, Brisbane. Herr Schmitt,
the Minister for Economy, intends to
docket every industry into a group, with
shop committees of Nazi employees to
bargain with group employers. The
group divisions are almost exactly the
same as those which Garden introduced
into N.S:W. trade-unionism while he was
official head of the Communist party.
Generally speaking, the new scheme em-
bodies every “first step towards Com-
munism” which Australian delegates
brought from the U.S.S.R. in 1923.
From first to last —that is, from the
time “when the war clouds lowered in
1917” to the end of 1918 —the U.S.A.
had two million soldiers engaged in the
Great War. As the “Encyclopaedia
Britannica” puts it, “not more than
600,000 actually came within reach of
the enemy.” Nevertheless, a grateful
Government allowed that they had all
won the war, and promised them a bonus
of a thousand dollars apiece. Now that
the President has commandeered all the
gold, the House of Representatives thinks
“Mr. G. B. Shaw has arrived in Maoriland and already given the people of that country
a great deal of advice.”
“Sydney? I’m not going there. I was never one for stealing a fellow-actor’s
thunder.”
the importunate warriors ought to get it
—in new paper dollars, backed by the
gold profits on dollar devaluation. Its
members have to face their constituents
this year. The President is expected to
veto the measure. He doesn’t have to
go to the country till November, 1937.
The Labor factionists having all gone
home, the U.A.P. and the C.P. had dis-
unity conferences of their own last week.
At a merry meeting in Daylesford, Hock-
ing, chairman of the Vic. Cocky organisa-
tion," was having a go at the banks when
a delegate chipped in to the effect that
Leitch, the spokesman for those institu-
tions, had wiped the floor with Hocking
in a recent argument. The U.A.P.-Cocky
State Ministry was angrily denounced and
just as angrily defended. Discussion of
Victorian politics was interrupted to allow
Earle Page to let fly at Lyons, who had
gone to a U.A.P. gathering at Goulburn.
That personage returned the fire, and the
pair went on strafing for days. The scene
shifted to Orange, where another band of
Yaps decided to run Dr. Nott against
Thorby, the C.P. member, at the general
election. There was none of this pitiful
brawling when Bruce was about.
Lyons is at a disadvantage when tack-
ling Earle Page. National insurance hav-
ing been mentioned, he taunted the
doctor with not having introduced it
when he had the chance. Bruce’s col-
league tartly replied that their Govern-
ment had brought in a bill and he had
made a second-reading speech.
Before the bill could go through I was
thrown out of office through Mr. Lyons and
his Labor colleagues going round Australia
saying that Mr. Bruce was out to cut wages
and smash arbitration.
Still girding at Page, the Yap leader
alleged that the negotiations for a coali-
tion had broken down because the C.P.
man wanted him to violate a grand old
principle of Parliamentary government—
that the Prime Minister should choose
his colleagues and decide what offices
they should 'fill. What happened to the
principle when the Labor Caucus picked
Scullin’s Ministers for him, Lyons among
them?
The missionary expedition to Caledon
Bay is bringing back some accommodat-
ing natives who have confessed to the
murders of white men. Everybody who
knows the northern abo.’s willingness to
oblige will hope—and gravely doubt —■
whether they are the right ones. Mr.
Perkins says that “the Government is
pleased at the success of the mission.”
It shouldn’t be. It is a grave reflection
on the Administration that a private
party should succeed with apparent ease
while Government had to give up the
job after losing the life of a policeman
and threatening a punitive expedition,
The eagerness with which the British
Treasury is redeeming masses of 1934-36
Treasury bills on the minimum date,
apparently with money secured from 10-
and 15-year-term 2\ p.c. loans, suggests
that the bottom of the cheap-money
market has been reached and that any
future change is likely to be upward. It
looks like a good hint for Canberra,
which will have a good deal more short-
term paper on its hands after April than
the British Government. Redemption
with current-rate medium-term loan
money might save a few millions in
interest later on.
It is a good thing for a country to
have an outspoken public servant like
Cerutty, the Commonwealth Auditor-
General. He hits high and low, and
doesn’t care if he pleases nobody. He
struck hard at the A.B.C. in his annual
report, issued last week, pointing out
that the staff showed an increase of 32
p.c. and the expenditure one of almost
23 p.c., and that the general manager had
—quite unwarrantably, in his opinion—
been allowed £5 a week for out-of-pocket
and entertainment expenses. Turning to
the old-age and invalid pensions expen-
diture, he said that such inquiries as had
been made indicated that the Common-
wealth was being defrauded right and
left —“a complete investigation would
disclose that tens of thousands of per-
sons are illegally drawing pensions.”
Lyons, who has to study votes, says he
doesn’t believe it.
Victorians were rather astonished when
they read the name of Parker Moloney
on the list of those seeking Labor nomi-
nations for the Senate. Moloney was
Scullin’s Minister of Markets when Scul-
lin had his breakdown, and was mentioned
as a possible Prime Minister. Somehow
he has always been regarded as a young
fellow with his future before him. In
point of fact, it is nearly 24 years since
he first got in for Indi, and he has had
to fight so hard at every succeeding elec-
tion that his desire for a quieter and
steadier post is understandable. "Collins,
the Country-party member, will be glad
to see him stand for the Senate ; no other
Labor man could have done so well in
Hume.
Fremantle Harbor Trust had to aban-
don its attempt to make wheat shippers
(principally Westralian Farmers) defray
the cost of a “go-slow” strike of lumpers,
arising from its own folly in paying an
extra 3d. an hour, not awarded by the
Court, to men handling bags on shore.
This concern was long ago converted into
a taxing machine. One year on gross
earnings of £560,700 it had a surplus for
the State Treasury of £193,500 —this after
paying interest and sinking-fund contri-
butions. Its charges are outrageous com-
pared with those ruling at outports with
comparatively primitive plants. From
truck to gantry it exacts nearly a third
of a penny per bag more than the Bun-
bury rate; and for storage per week,
twice as much.
Stirred up by Communists, Minister
Dunningham asserts, relief workers in
Sydney have engaged in a strike for
morning tea, Government to provide tea
and time in which to drink it and chat
over the events of the day. The men
tidying up the approaches to Melbourne’s
Shrine of Remembrance have also
downed tools. They had been accused
of loafing, and one of them wrote to the
“Argus” saying that their policy was to
give the bare worth of what they found
in the pay envelope. Sometimes these
accusations are indignantly repelled. For
instance, one of Dunningham’s gangers
wrote to a suburban council denying that
his men had “worn out the handles of
their mattocks by leaning on them.”

Herbert Phillipps, rosy-cheeked and
active at 86, has been reappointed chair-
man of the S. Aus. Savings Bank. He
became a trustee in 1900, was in the chair
within two years and has occupied it ever
since.
One of the most popular dons at Melb.
Uni. is Prof. Giblin, of the lapelless coat,
short black pipe, sky-blue shirt and flam-
ing-red tie. Born in Tasmania, he
traversed most of Europe on foot as a
young man. He mined in the Klondyke,
knocked round South America and, came
home on a windjammer before the mast.
Then he started a poultry farm. His

career as a poulterer was interrupted by
the war, from which he returned with
field rank and a magnificent black spade
beard. He next entered the Speck Parlia-
ment. A double first in maths, at Cam-
bridge earned him his present job of
Ritchie Professor of Economics at Melb.
Uni. Mainly a research job, it enabled
him to give valuable service as Com-
monwealth Statistician. He wrote the
famous propaganda “Letters to John
Smith” in Melb. “Herald” at the begin-
ning of Depresh.
Dr. C. E. Dolling, of Adelaide, created
a record of sorts last week. When he
boarded the Port Auckland as ship’s
doctor he was the first Test selector to
leave Australia in that capacity. He will
be able to see all the cricket he wants,
thereby taking a doctor’s, selector’s and
’busman’s holiday in one.
One of Bruce’s trunks aboard the
Oronsay contains a Lyell Medal. The
Royal Geological Society asked the ex-
P.M. to hand it to Prof. Wally Howchin,
of Goodwood, S.A. The professor held
the Chair of Geology at the Adelaide
Uni. until a few years back, when he
reached the wrong side of 80. The medal
has been awarded for his work in glacial
research.
Leslie Lefeaux, who has arrived in
M.L. to govern the new Reserve Bank,
was once assistant to Montague Norman,
of the Bank of England—and that’s about
all M.L. knows of him. He will receive
£5OOO a year, free of income tax. This
has caused adverse criticism. As governor
of the Reserve Bank he will almost cer-
tainly advise the Government on taxa-
tion, and some taxpayers think he
shouldn’t be immune himself.
Sir Alex. Hore-Ruthven, V.C., looks
like getting an interesting job when he
leaves S. Aus. It is understood that he
will succeed the late Viscount Churchill
at. Ascot. Amongst other duties, he will
have to deal with the thousands of appli-
cations for admission to the Enclosure
in Ascot Week. He is keenly interested
in racing here and abroad. At a recent
race-club luncheon he gave those present
a “good thing” for the next English
Derby.
Michael Gill, who has died in M.L. at
the age of 96, was born in Co. Clare,
Ireland. He joined the 57th Foot when
17, served in the Crimean and Indian
Wars, came to Maoriland after his dis-
charge and joined the Forest Rangers.
He was with Von Tempsky when that old
battler died. Gill’s last thrill consisted in
being buried for two days after the 1931
Hawke’s Bay ’quake. He passed out a
day after his comrade, Sarmajor Bezar,
the Windy City’s pet veteran, had cele-
brated his 96th birthday.
Dr. F. McCallum, who has succeeded
Dr. Cilento in Brisbane as Chief Quaran-
tine Officer, North-eastern Division,
served in the war with the A.M.C. In
1922-23 he studied epidemiology in U.S.,
took a diploma of tropical hygiene in
London, and in 1925-27 was attached to
the hookworm campaign in N.Q. In
1929 he was chief M.O. at Australia
House, London, and represented the
Commonwealth at the International
Public Health Office, Paris.
“N.E.G.”: Clyde Fenton, who has just
been appointed flying doctor at Katha-
rine, Northern Territory, has had a stir-
ring life. Amongst other things, he has
climbed allegedly unclimbable peaks in
Switzerland, and has been attacked in
London by a homicidal maniac with a
butcher’s knife. He is perhaps the only
person who has performed the danger-
ous operation of tonsillectomy upon him-
self. He was in the Never Never at the
time, and he did the job standing in
front of a mirror in his tent.
The new S. Aus. Auditor-General has
been regularly called upon by Govern-
ments of his State of late years when a
financial tangle had to be unravelled. The
first Butler Administration appointed him
to a select committee on State finance.
Three years later he served on the Hill
Government’s advisory committee on
State finance, and he was also on the
J. W. WAINWRIGHT, a one-time
school-teacher who has become
Auditor-General of S. Aus.
special Budget committee. “Go slow and
play no monkey tricks,” is his mone-
tary motto. He is a B.A. of Adelaide

W. J. Spruson is an eminent Sydney
consulting engineer and patent attorney.
In the course of 40 years in business, he
has seen the birth and rapid growth of
the petrol-engine, the flying-machine,
radio, television and a score of other
wonders. Most local inventions of any
importance have passed through his cap-
able hands, and, on being signed, sealed
and delivered in the shape of a patent
W. J. SPRUSON, of N. S. Wales, patent
attorney and ex-M.L.A.
specification, have found themselves
equipped to face a litigious world
armored with an unchallengeable defini-
tion. Reduction of complicated facts to
plain English is Spruson’s strong point.
He tried politics as a young man, and
represented West Sydney at the end of the
’nineties ; but, not finding the atmosphere
to his taste, he got out. He leaves on
a European tour next month.
J. R. Rymill, of S.A., who will lead the
next British Polar expendition, is a son of
Robert Rymill, who was killed in a motor
smash. His mother was a daughter of
John Riddoch, friend and supporter of
A. L. Gordon. Sid, vinegrower and
sportsman, is his uncle. Cousins are
Arthur, company director and motor-
boat owner; Ernest, the pigeon shot;
and (in his own generation) Jack the
cricketer; “Lum,” pilot of the Tortoise ;
and golf champions Katherine and Bill.
“J.”: Patrick Hill, a centenarian who
came to Australia from Co. Clare 55
years ago, and has lived near Newcastle
(N.S.W.) for more than half that time,
struck a new note when asked the usual
question on his birthday last week. “If
you want to live to my age,” he told
the reporters, “don’t marry.” London
“Punch” said something like it when the
old gentleman was in his prime, but most
other 100-year-olds have given credit to
teetotalism (or alcoholism, with special
reference to beer) rather than to celi-
bacy.
“Jeb”: It was like Edgar Percival to
astonish Gravesend with a spectacular
flight of his new ’plane. It is successor
to the Gull which did so well in the
King’s Cup last year, and which brought
Smithy to Australia on his record run.
Had our authorities been less wooden-
headed he might have done the job from
Mascot. Percival, in the air, is the coun-
terpart of that famous British race-driver
Parry Thomas. His ’planes in Australia
were makeshift-looking affairs which had
the appearance of being tied up with
string. He got into trouble for being
the first man to fly under the Harbor
Bridge. He already ranks in Britain
with Hawker as a designer and test pilot.
“Jeames” on doubles:
I see by Sydney “Telegraph” that “Prince
George has a double right here in Sydney.”
This is quite in order; he will have doubles in
every part of the Commonwealth for as long
as the press continues to ballyhoo him. Doubles
of the Prince of Wales are common in the
English provinces, and they are often taken
seriously by those who haven’t seen the original.
There is a certain pathos about most doubles —
I have been shown more London shopwalker
doubles of Sir John Simon, more railway-porter
and ’bus-conductor doubles of Lloyd George
(soup-catcher moustache and all) than I could
count —but you can get a laugh out of one or
two. I was dining at the Dome on Montparnasse
some years ago when a friend who makes his
living by ’phoning news nightly to a Swedish
paper from the hall of his abode in the Rue des
Saints Peres rushed up. “The Prince of Wales!”
“Rot! He’s in London.” “Come! Judge for
yourself. I have hear him spoke.” I found
H.R.H. entertaining a couple of ladies behind
an adjacent pillar. He was wearing his check
reach-me-down suit, with a sumptuous garnet
pin in a Guards tie, and black-and-white golf
shoes. “The sime agine, gassong!” he was
crying hospitably as we passed. “I apologise,”
I said to my friend. “I thought you might
have struck another double.” That night the
telephone wire to Sweden ran _ hot with an
exclusive story of the Prince’s incognito visit
to Paris.
J. K. im Thurn no doubt felt a pang
of regret when he shifted his flag from
the Sussex prior to that vessel’s being
commissioned for Prince George’s Aus-
tralian tour. He was last with us in
command of H.M.S. Hood in ’24, and
conceived a strong liking for Australia.
Apart from being one of the navy’s
handsomest flag-rankers in the senior
service, he is a world expert in naval
wireless. Before he commanded the
Hood, he was Director of Signals, and,
after his return from the cruise, head of
the Signal School at Portsmouth. It was
on a set rigged by him on the Hood that
the first human voice came over the ether
from U.S.A. to Australia —the honeyed
accents of Donald Mackinnon, the Com-
monwealth High Commissioner, telling
America about our wheat through
KDKA.
Harold Clapp’s devices have popular-
ised railway travelling in the Cabbage
Garden, and he is a skilful advertiser
of his State’s products and scenic
beauties. He learned his business in
the U.S.A., and he has a vague resemb-
lance to a N. York executive in
voice, bearing and headgear, though he

ways, about to leave Melbourne on

was born in Australia. They like him in
Toorak, where he lives ; in the Melbourne
Club, to which he has belonged for years;
and on the railway lines, which he
periodically inspects well freighted with
cigars. The cigars are handed with his
commendations (which are even more
appreciated than the cigars) to those who
prove to have been doing their jobs.
Hobbies: Keeping himself fit and sticking
up for America.

Ten years ago the co. was ranked
amongst Australia’s greatest money-
spinners. Its shipping and cpal interests
were passed to subsidiaries in 1915, when
£1,050,000 of bonus scrip was scattered,
and a further half-million of similar paper
was sent out nine years later. Paid capi-
tal thus became £2,250,000, of which the
quarter-million carries a fixed cumulative
6 p.c. and has priority as to capital. This
pref. money was got in during 1927 to
help pay for scrip in iron and steel,
cement and blue-metal ventures, which
have not yet contributed to the pool.
More than half the co.’s own funds is
now represented by scrip which is not
turning in anything. During the ten
years to 1924 the ords. averaged 12 p.c.
p.a. Then labor troubles and slump
crippled coal earnings and interfered with
returns from the shipping section —it
used to be the old Howard Smith line ;
now it’s Australian Steamships Pty.—
which is the chief source of the co.’s
income. A few years ago the co.’s hold-
ings in its principal subsidiaries were as
follows:

Caledonian has passed its div. for the
last five years, and Invincible for the
last three, while Aust. Iron and Steel,
which paid 5 p.c. in 1929, has not made
an ord. distribution since; its prospect's
have brightened, but the pref. div. is in
arrears. The cement and blue-metal ven-
tures have been even more disappointing.
The co. also has a substantial interest in
Australian Sugar (paid capital £207,915),
which has sent out a steady 12 p.c. since
1924.
Apparently the shipping co., over
whose figures the curtain is kept drawn,
sent along a little more last year, and
the call for depreciation may not have
been quite so loud. Net earnings, which
sprang £29,753, were enough to pay the
pref. div. (£15,000) and show 1.6 p.c. on
ord. capital, on which ly p.c. was paid,
after a four-year spell.
The market, which expects the co.
to do better, has lengthened its bid for
the pound shares from 9s. to 16s. over
the last 12 months. At the higher figure
the investor who looks for 4.3 p.c. on his
money counts on a 3y p.c. div., which,
together with the annual pref. require-
ments, would call for £85,000. Imme-
diate prospects depend largely upon
better receipts from the shipping section
and upon the co.’s own earnings as man-
aging agent, which should improve with
the general revival of business. It is
difficult to say exactly when the steel,
coal and cement cos. are likely to con-
tribute.
A book value of £3,126,173 (up
£31,697 during the year) is placed upon
shares' in other cos. Fixed assets, mainly
premises and plant, figure at £178,507,
down £6145. The liquid position im-
proved £6618, notwithstanding the addi-
tion to shareholdings:

It has been a splendid recovery, and,
subject to trade developments, the co.
promises to continue to give a good
account of itself. Formed in 1921, it
developed rapidly, and looked like be-
coming a steady 10 percenter. But slump
flooded the market with stocks, which
meant price-cutting, while discriminating
industrial legislation in N. S. Wales
brought unequal competition from Vic-
toria, thus spoiling the financial results
of fresh opportunities which the tariff
and exchange provided. Hence the prefs.,
which got only half a meal in ’29, were
passed by in ’3O. The board, however,
went the right way about things. Im-
proved production methods and savings
in administration and distribution charges
allowed the co. to further reduce its
prices, while the opening of selling
branches in Melbourne and Brisbane
helped to revive turnover. Also, some
expensive agreements, which resulted in
domestic and other differences, have been
terminated.
As the pressure of stocks upon the
market eased, and conditions generally
improved, earnings responded, and the
prefs.’ slate has now been cleaned and
the ords., after a three-year wait, are
back in the picture with a 5 p.c. div.
Last year turnover further improved,
selling prices were steadier and the sharp
rise in the price of wool did the co. no
harm. Gross earnings (£150,950) were
£22,498 better, making the spring
£44,945 over the last two years. Exes.
(£126,544, including provision for taxa-
tion, etc.)- took £12,719 of the increase,
leaving enough to pay a year’s pref. div.
(7f p.c. after allowing for the statutory
cut) and show 10.8 p.c. on ord. capital
as against 5 p.c. and 1 p.c. for the two
preceding terms.

To clip £12,871 off the overdraft, £2073
off the amount coming to trade creditors
and spend £7053 more than was written
off on fixed assets, stocks were reduced
by £3484 and debtors’ balances by
£3133; surplus earnings provided the
balance. The improvement in the more
or less liquid surplus (£156,327, includ-
ing stocks) was £9304.
As for prospects, the immediate trad-
ing outlook is bright enough: further
improvements have been made to the
plant, and the co. has come within the
scope of the Federal award, thus elimi-
nating the inequality in competition
already referred to.
On the market the ords. have advanced
from 11s. to 245. 4d. and the prefs. from
255. to 28s. 3d. over the last twelve
months. At 28s. 3d. the prefs. return
5.4 p.c. on a 7| p.c. div. basis —they
move with the ords. from 7\ p.c. to

245. 4d. is a shade over 4 p.c. The net
tangible cover is £3 13s. sd. prefs. and

After many vicissitudes, Finneys shows
its best and most encouraging profit for
over a decade. During the dozen years
to the close of accounts in 1921, share-
holders averaged 8.1 p.c., sweetened with
£57,514 of bonus scrip! For the next
10 years it was a struggle to pay an aver-
age of 5.6 p.c. That was chiefly because
the attempt to widen the co.’s connec-
tions in the country, largely on a t.-p.
basis, failed to produce the results ex-
pected. So it was decided to concentrate
on city turnover, and the last of the
branches was closed in 1929 —the with-
drawal from Maryborough alone cost
£12,247. Then, just as the figures began
to improve, slump and its concomitants
intervened; and it was not until the
figures were published in 1933 that in-
vestors had much of an opportunity of
judging the outcome of it all.
Though the appearance of Coles and
Woolsworths helped to bring more people
into Queen-street, Finneys has exerted
a strong ,pull, too. A new cafe, better
lift service, brighter store and, appa-
rently, the right type of goods sent turn-
over up 22 p.c. during the 12 months
to the end of Jan., 1933. Last term the
improvement appears to have been
nearly as good. Gross earnings
(£165,544) were £19,811 better, making
the spring £40,322 over the last year.
Including £lB,lBO (up £11,338) reserved
for taxation, bad debts and other con-
tingencies, exes. (£140,987) took £13,778
of the increase, leaving the net result
a wink over 9 p.c. on capital as against
6.6, 4.4, 1.8, 7.1, 3.7, 3, 7.3 and 8 p.c.
back to 1926. The div. was lifted a
point, making 7 p.c. for the year, the
final being at the rate of 8 p.c. p.a.
The pound shares, which were priced
at 13s. two years ago, now fetch 265. 6d.
The return at the higher figure is 5.2 p.c.
on a 7 p.c. div. basis, or 6 p.c. on an
8 p.c. distribution. The prop for capital,
however, is none too stout; the net
tangible cover is 21s. lid. per share.
Here is the position as the published
accounts show it:

*Half-year’s div.
This energetic Melbourne concern, which
manufactures shirts, collars and other
men’s wear, had gone substantially
into debt to finance a vigorous sales
offensive, which promised well, when the
whole outlook suddenly changed color.
To reduce outside liabilities, stocks
and book debts had to be worked
down at the worst possible moment,
while exchange and the tariff —the co.
imports much of its raw material —and
the hand-to-mouth policy of retailers
aggravated the difficulties. Thus a loss of
£11,334 in 1930 was followed by another
of £38,550 in ’3l.
However, the board lost no time in
adjusting the co.’s position to the early
problems which slump created. In ’32
gross earnings (£75,353) sprang £53,703, a
profit of £10,784 was recorded (an im-
provement of £49,334 on the previous
year’s result), and arrears of A pref. divs.
were paid.
During the last term there was a
further increase in the volume of busi-
ness, but competition sharpened, margins
narrowed, and gross earnings (£76,454)
were only £llOl better. Exes. (£67,805,
including something for the taxgatherer
and bad debts), took all the increase and
£2135 besides, leaving enough profit to
cover a full year’s pref. divs. and show
0.6 p.c. on ord. capital. After paying the
A’s their £2082, the B’s were handed
5 p.c., leaving £13,250 (= ss. 3|d. per
share) to come. The £4067 that re-
mained reduced the amount of capital
unrepresented by tangibles to £22,420.
That leaves out of the reckoning a reserve
of £8441 (down £1824 during the year)
against exchange on bills payable and
goods afloat.
The position as balance-sheet figures
show it is as follows: —•

To carry an extra £10,002 of stocks and
£3948 of book debts, the co. went to
its bankers for a further £13,388, raising
the overdraft to £73,849. There was little
change in the amount coming to sundry
creditors (£54,230), The improvement in
the more or less liquid surplus (£70,459,
including stocks) was £lOO9.
There are 29,736 A and 50,000 B prefs.,
carrying a cumulative 7 p.c. and 9 p.c.
respectively. They rank in the order
stated for capital and dividends. The
book value of the net tangible cover is
£7 9s. 6d., A’s; £3 175., B’s; Bs. Bd.,

This concern, which supplies Brisbane
and its suburbs with electric current,
used to be a steady 10 percenter. But
10 p.c. from a public utility these days is
looked at askance, so the div. was low-
ered to 8 p.c. during the last half of
1930, and has remained steady since. The
board sums up the situation in this way:
“The directors again consider that, in the
interests of shareholders, a strong finan-
cial position is important, and their re-
commendations are entirely in the direc-
tion of strength, coupled with a reason-
able dividend.” This might be taken to
mean that the 8 p.c. is as assured as
anything of the kind can be in the cir-
cumstances, and that, should money
become dearer, there are possibilities that
shareholders may get a bit more. Much,
of course, depends upon the efficiency
of the plant, in which respect technical
improvements, most of them affecting cost
of production, make the charge for
obsolescence heavy.
Last year £106,628 was added to the
renewals, replacements and contingencies
account, while £93,730 (£52,254 in the
previous term) was charged against it to
cover the cost of renewals and the writ-
ing off of assets scrapped. The net growth
in this fund (£849,154) was thus £12,898
as against £68,357 in the previous year.
This accounts for all but a fraction of
the drop of £55,480 in the year’s net
earnings, which also include £3380
dropped into the franchise sinking fund,
raising it to within £1903 of the pur-
chase account (£62,723), not included as
an asset herein.
Here is a view of the business from
another angle:

During the year £77,746 more was
written off than was spent on fixed assets,
while the growth in the more or less
liquid surplus (£505,576, including stocks)
was £94,024 —the cash balance (£424,391)
increasing by £155,342. The board has not
yet dropped any hint as to what it intends
to do with this spare money.
The prefs.—2o,ooo 6 per cents, and
125,000 7 per cents.—are preferential as
to dividend only. For capital they rank
equally with the ords., after deducting
reserved profits. On the market the 6
per cents, are not active; the 7 per
cents, fetch 295., and the ords. 325. lOd.
On the basis of last year’s divs., the
return at these figures is 4.8 p.c. in
each case. The backing per pound of
paid capital is 325. lOd. in net tangibles.

Agricultural implements are the back-
bone of the business, though the co. does
a considerable trade in general hardware
as well —both are difficult lines these
days. Indeed, there was never much fat
in the trade. For the five generally flush
years to the close of accounts in 1930
the ords. got a steady 6 p.c. from profits
averaging 8.1 p.c. on ord. capital. During
the post-war decade the business was
developed along mail-order lines, fol-
lowed, when sufficient turnover had been
secured, by the opening of branches at

He's playing the game
-ARE YOU?
THIS young husband is entitled to be light-
hearted. He is “playing the game” fairly and
squarely by his wife and boy. He is providing
them with comfort according to his means, and he
is insured for £l,OOO in the A.M.P. He took out
one policy for £5OO when he married, and another
when the boy was born. These call for an invest-
ment of only a few shillings a week. Should any-
thing happen to him his wife will have £l,OOO, plus
bonuses, and many an A.M.P. policy has doubled
its value with bonuses before it was claimed. There
isn’t a better way of saving money in all the world.
The Society is the largest mutual life office in the
Empire, and every member’s policy is backed by
£92,000,000 worth of assets.

Horsham. Also, Hart’s old hardware
business in Launceston was bought in
1929.
Last year the demand for builders’
hardware was better, but low returns for
farm products limited the volume of
orders available in the main branch of
the co.’s activities, and prices had to be
cut to unremunerative levels in order to
meet competition. Still, new lines were
introduced, and the co. sold more of the
products of its own factory. Gross earn-
ings (£54,295) fell away £323, making the
slip £29,667 over the last four years.
Exes. (£54,021, including provision for de-
preciation, etc.) were £1484 heavier, due
to the extra cost of putting the new lines
on the market. The £274 that remained
was not enough for a div. Payments to
the prefs. have thus fallen three and a
half years behind; at next balance there
will be £20,300 (= ss. lOd. per shqre)
coming to them.
Since 1924 the co. has gathered

“Ore-Dressing”: Four plants at Broken
Hill dress 100,000 tons of ore a month.
Of these one is a straight flotation plant
and the other three are flotation plus
gravity-concentration. Recoveries from
the lead-silver-zinc ore are all fairly
similar, but costs vary. To determine
which process is best, a test plant of
fair size is being built. Results doubtless
will be available later. At Kalgoorlie
there is also a difference of opinion re-
garding treatment of gold ore by the wet
processes. One large plant—another of
similar type is being built —saves and
treats only its concentrates; another
treats all of its ore. Extractions and costs
by both systems are said to be much the
same.

“Mandate”: Last year New Guinea
produced 248,0880 z. of bullion as against
133,8470 z. in 1932. Of last year’s total,
Bulolo contributed 136,0000 z. and New
Guinea Goldfields 42,0000 z. Their re-
spective profits were £A500,000 and
£A160,000. Bulolo’s boats dug 5,880,000
cubic yards, which will be greatly ex-
ceeded this year. In 1933 Papua pro-
duced 9991 fine ounces of gold as against
13,3360 z. of 62-shilling metal in the pre-
vious year. New Misima was the largest
contributor. The meeting at Canberra
this month of the Administrators of the
two Territories is expected to better
mining conditions in each. • A definite
boundary is being surveyed, and both are
to have the same code of prospecting and
mining regulations, with the area for
prospecting leases much enlarged.
* * * *
The diamond-drilling campaign at Mt.
Coolon (Q.) has been disappointing, and
exploration of the easterly extension of
the lode channel has revealed only one
promising quartz vein, 2ft. wide, worth
28s. Ore reserves at the end of 1933
were put at 82,000 tons, worth 955. a
ton with gold at £7 an ounce. In addi-
tion, there is 14,000 tons sands averaging
455. So, unless something turns up, there
is about 18 months’ work ahead. In
conjunction with Gold Mines of Australia,
the co. is looking over an 85-mile stretch
of alluvial on the Burdekin River (Q.).
* * * *
The Mt. Success goldmine, Fanning
River (N.Q.), is being unwatered and will
be cleaned up and tested under an option
secured by a prominent N.Q. co. It is
classed as a big low-grade proposition,
with possibilities at present gold prices.
It has been opened to a depth of 200 ft.,
and 150 tons of ore left lying at the
surface as unpayable, when mined,
recently assayed about Bdwt. Prospectors’
returns from the outcrop for a period of
10 years totalled 1885 tons, averaging
7dwt. by amalgamation; but several
parcels of concentrates yielded an extra
3dwt, to 6dwt. Since all-in costs are not
expected to exceed 255., roughly the equi-
valent of 3dwt., the show now appears to
have more than an even-money chance.
* * * *
The first sod will be turned shortly on
the important dredging development at
the old Crocodile field, outside Rock-
hampton (C.Q.). The Croc, has a record
tor alluvial gold, but it was Donald Fraser
who set the dredging scheme going, and
a £20,000 plant is almost ready. The
ground has been check-bored, values
going from 3s. to 4s. per yard. Costs
are estimated at under Is. Provided there
are no mechanical difficulties in the wash,
the margin should be wide enough.
* * * *
A 1 Consolidated (Vic.) hopes to balance
on the right side by the middle of the
year. About 50,000 tons of ioz. stone is
available, the manager says, and prepara-
tions are being made to treat to
3dwt. stuff in the dump. The co. has a
clear £750 in the bank.
* * * *
Government Geologist Keith Ward’s
summary of borings at the Bird-in-Hand,
Woodside (S. Aus.), confirms the exist-
ence of the ore-bodies at 600 ft. Two
lodes are proved; the first, 3£ft. wide,
averaged 12dwt., and the second, 20ft.
wide, carried over 9dwt., with some rich
patches in places. Dr. Ward stated that
no gold was visible in the stone, and that
the penetration of the lode by water had
oxidised the pyrite to limonite. Captain
John Warren entertained high hopes of
this proposition.
* * * *
Flushed with the success of placing
the Tindals group, Coolgardie (W.A.),
with Western Mining Corp., Hermann
Mandelstam has gone to London to raise
capital for the development of Edjudina.
This field has miles of workings and a
good average yield to its credit. It is
about 100 miles north-east of Kalgoorlie,
and was discovered in the early ’nineties.
The Great Fingall Co. began there, but,
after buying a costly milling plant in
London and transporting it from Albany
to the field, it gave up, and subsequently
sold out. Later small parties operated
with success, but none had sufficient capi-
tal to tackle the gold carriers at depth.
* * * *
Mararoa (W.A.), which received
£50,000 for the Emu blocks at Reedy’s
(W.A.), has reached the liquidation stage.
Provided negotiations with the taxation
authorities are not unduly prolonged,
those on the register should soon re-
ceive a few shillings per share. Emu
was first tried by working miners in
1915; afterwards two Perth syndicates
butted in, and then backed out. Later
the Mararoa, which left Norseman and
a quantity of gold in its old mine, decided
to try its luck. It didn’t succeed, prin-
cipally because it was never financially
strong enough to do the job properly.
After failing to do business with Great
Boulder, it gave an option and finally
sold out for the sum mentioned to Anglo-
Australian investors, who recently formed
the Triton Co. to work the properties.
* * * *
Claude de Bernales is presently ex-
pected to place Fraser’s old group at
Southern Cross (W.A.) on the London
market. Fraser’s, which was a good show
down to 400 ft., paid divs. on a small
capital for years. Then something hap-
pened and nobody has made money out
of it since. Still, those who know the
group and its history reckon that it has
a chance.
•t*
Coolgardie (W.A.) celebrated the open-
ing of a new battery—the first on the field
for 30 years—on the Empress mine the
other day. This mine was held by a
local prospector until the enhanced price
of gold attracted the attention of the
Empress Co. The co. placed the cart
before the horse by spending money on
a mill, etc., which would have been
better laid out on development.
He * * *
From London: Lake View, in buying
the Associated, was probably influenced
as much by the quantity of gold in the
surface tailings dump as in the mine.
The dump is a big one, and the profit
from retreatment is estimated here to be
well above what Lake View paid for the
property.
* * * *
Interest in Greenbushes tinfield (W.A.)
has livened, following a report by
Assistant Government Geologist Forman
that boring for deep leads is warranted.
To date the field has produced about a
million pounds’ worth of tin, all from
comparatively shallow workings.
* * * *
Westralian Gold Development Syndi-
cate, which last year unsuccessfully spent
£1673 in the hunt for something worth
while in Westralia, has now decided to
test some 160 acres of auriferous country
about a mile and a half from the Bulletin
leases at Wiluna.
* * * *
The language test for foreign mine-
workers began at Kalgoorlie the other
day, and is to be extended to Gwalia.
It is the outcome of the recent anti-
foreign riots in Kalgoorlie and Boulder,
but is not expected to result in many
rejects.

SHADOW SHOWS.
“Hold That Girl”
A 60-m.p.h. comedy at the Regent,
which follows the pressgirl-policeman
formula. There is the usual editor —
chronically enraged, no tie, the night
watchman’s hat. To him enter Claire
Trevor, reporter —blonde, brazen and
toothy ; hard of face, soft of heart: an
indefatigable wisecracker. James Dunn
is the cop with catch-line, viz., “I’ll give
ut my poissonul attenshun.” Every time
he says this he cocks his hat over one
eye and sticks a big cigar in the side of
his mouth.
Miss Trevor’s adventures include get-
ting locked up with a homicidal maniac.
She removes what Queen Victoria would
have called her unmentionables and
writes an appeal for help on them which
is read by Mr. Dunn as the garment
flutters down to the street. Also she
is discovered by a thug in the back of
a car immediately after he has murdered
a man in the front. The head thug—
who lives in dress clothes when not in
marine attire aboard his yacht— wants
to marry her ; but she feels that life will
be more exciting as a policeman’s bride.
“Ann Vickers”
The casting is the worst feature of this
sketchy version of Sinclair Lewis’s novel.
(Incidentally, the censor has made it still
sketchier by carving large bits out.)
Irene Dunne, the heroine, is one of
the few female talkie stars who look in-
telligent, and her voice and articulation
are cultivated. Yet she is first shown
being won, and discarded, by Bruce
Cabot; and the love of her life is Walter
Huston. Cabot, as the young soldier, is
a yahoo in voice, manners and appear-
ance, and Huston, as the corrupt Judge,
is a similar type in middle age. The
cheery wink which he directs at the
heroine during his trial is characteristic ;
it means that he isn’t ashamed of his
position, and will do whatever comes to
him “on his head.” Here, as in so many
previous pictures, Hollywood exposes
rotten aspects of the American social
system. This spirit of objectivity is no
doubt one of the reasons why Hollywood
films, with all their weaknesses, continue
to lead the world. Most English films
are careful to say nothing at all, and
German and Russian films seem to con-
centrate on mendacious political propa-
ganda. Great is truth ; and, what’s more,
it pays.
“The Big Shakedown”
A Capitol gangster which gives some
old furrows a new top-dressing. Ricardo
Cortez, suave, smiling, ruthless, was a
racketeer in beer till the repeal of pro-
hibition killed his industry. When we
meet him he is a forger of the patent
medicines which bulk so largely in
U.S.A. advts. He is assisted by a nice-
looking young chemist (Charles Farrell).
For a time all goes well; but when
they sell antiseptics that don’t anti-
sept because they are innocent of
borax, and digitalis that doesn’t affect
the heart, there’s trouble. Bette Davis
(Farrell’s wife) pulls through, but
their first baby is stillborn, because
of drugs that aren’t up to label. What
more natural than that Farrell should
shoot the racketeer? What more just
than that the body should fall into a
vat of hydrochloric acid and boil away
to nothing? As everybody knows, with-
out the corpse you can’t have a murder
conviction. The chemistry of the opus
may be questionable, but the acting is
first-class, particularly that of the
racketeer’s heelers.
“Fury of the Jungle”
This tropical fantasia has many fami-
liar touches. Specifically we find a dip-
somaniacal doctor with a Sydney Carton
complex, by Dudley Digges ; an innocent
young girl marooned among human

Melb. Symphony Orchestra added
Pouishnoff to the band one evening last
week, and with this aid gave the Men-
delssohn G Minor Concerto, in which
the Russian virtuoso demonstrated the
essential virtues of the good concerto
pianist—sufficient power to ride the
storm ; crisp, clean enunciation ; no fancy
frills of phrasing. The previous number

by the orchestra (without Pouishnoff) was
Haydn’s “Clock Symphony,” conducted
by Bernard Heinze with more reverence
than gaiety. “Papa” wouldn’t have liked
it. But when Pouishnoff declaimed the
first few bars of the G Minor, Mendels-
sohn took charge and conductor, pianist
and orchestra were swept along. That’s
how it sounded, and the remark is a
tribute to everyone concerned —not for-
getting Mendelssohn. Second half of
the programme was Russian. Borodin’s
“Prince Igor” overture —gloomy, tragic,
introspective, full of strange rhythms—
was given by orchestra alone, and very
creditably. Then came Rachmaninoff’s
Second Concerto. It illustrates —at far too
great length most people will say—the
strengths and the weaknesses of Rach-
maninoff’s inspiration. As a test for both
solo pianist and orchestra it is searching.
It does not carry itself, as do the simi-
larly instrumented works of the Germans
and the Austrians, but must be carried.
Pouishnoff seemed to understand it, and,
as leading voice, made it hang together,
assisted by Rachmaninoff’s Wagnerian
trick of repeating a motif impressively
whenever a movement peters out —pre-
paring the way for a new one. The
orchestra was, evidently, a bit scared, and
it let the pianist carry the baby all the
way. There was mighty applause, but
present critic sympathised with the
elderly lady who said plaintively, coming
out, “I suppose it’s all very beautiful, but
why don’t they play more things with a
tune in ’em —like that first one?”

Horace Stevens and Leff Pouishnoff
continue to collaborate in the manufac-
ture of musical goods at the Town Hall,
Melbourne, and sales last week could
hardly have been brisker. Pouishnoff is
devoid of the usual showmanship. He is
an earnest and conscientious artist. On
Saturday he successfully weathered the
tempests of Liszt and plumbed the depths
of Chopin’s B Flat Minor Sonata.
Stevens took Rossini’s “Largo al Facto-
tum” along at a rare old bat, and felt
it as much as the average village-green
performer. He excelled himself in “By
a Bierside” —words by Masefield, music
by Armstrong. For his second encore
the large attendance was rewarded with
“King Charles.”

J. B. Priestley’s habit of complacent
endings persists in “The Roundabout,”
produced by the Melbourne Un-named
Players. Lord Kettlewell, while condon-
ing the shakiness of his “Imperial Neces-
sities” shares, is swooped upon by
daughter Pamela, whom he hasn’t seen
since she was a child. Bolshie Pamela in
slacks, accompanied by Comrade Staggles
in a turkey-red shirt, has just returned
from the U.S.S.R. (the girl’s job there
was a “psycho-technical” one, drawing
graphs to plot the most economical
arrangement of labels upon tins of the
Red October Candy Factory). Pamela
gets rid of the Designing Woman by en-
couraging Comrade Staggles, drunk after
a capitalistic luncheon, to pursue the
D.W. as a necessary ingredient to his
“full, rich love-life.” Enter Lady Kettle-
well, who,, after ten years’ marital
estrangement, is immediately taken for an
intimate stroll in the garden by a devoted
husband. A fatuous and unnecessary
young man is introduced as a wind-up
for Pamela. The most effective parts in
the Un-named Players’ version were those
of Lady Knightsbridge (Alberta Conroy
made much of this role) and Comrade
Staggles, played by Ray Connell. Joseph
Finn, as Parsons, did well in the thumb-
nail sketch of inebriation in which he
celebrates the winning of a sweep.
George Walton made sheep’s eyes as the
parasitic Churston Saunders. Royde
Milton was Kettlewell, Vera Luttrell
made a brittle Hilda Lancicourt, and
Clare Coffey would have been more con-
vincing as Pamela had she remembered
the distraction of strong spotlights on
thin dresses.

“Something Different,” which turned
up at Melb. Palace on Saturday, is an
attempt by the stage to filch back from
the screen some of its own property. It
was adapted by A. R. Harwood, Jas.
Dee and Les Raphael, local literati, from
a cinema classic. Generally, the show
proved unpretentiously amusing, and at
the same time unexpectedly full of vir-
tues. Frith, as a lunatic at large, carried
a heavy burden lightly. Les Raphael’s
music, bright and coquettish and full of
reminiscences of every composer who has
ever tuned a lyre, flowed easily through
an evening diversified by gay ballets and
comic sketches. The ballets were really
something different. Designer Mavis
Ripper clothed her ladies with costumes
of genuine architectural beauty and real
originality, and the damsels performed
before backgrounds by Fred Ward which
were unique and appropriate, and some
of which, intelligently lighted, deserved
the abused adjective “artistic.” Leading
lady Jeanne Battie, a lovely, animated
brunette, came from an obscure situation
in a Williamsonian chorus to disclose the
possession of a perfectly ravishing figure,
a cheerful personality and a musical
voice—the last an excellent and rare
thing in leading women. In short, a find.

Sydney Con. orchestra’s first concert
of the year was made up of vivid con-
trasts —Beethoven’s Fifth; Respighi’s
“Pines of Rome” ; first act of “Valkyrie” ;
one of the Elgar “Enigma” variations.
Best done, probably because most
familiar, was the Beethoven number ; a
little more imagination and a little less
restraint would not have been amiss. The
Italian composer’s programmatic work
didn’t hang very well together, but was
pleasing in parts. In “Valkyrie” Madame
Goossens-Viceroy, Lance Jeffree and
Raymond Beatty sang the principal arias,
the lady scoring most of the honors.. The
Elgar excerpt, a memorial offering, was
not very effective divorced from its con-
text.

“The Beloved Vagabond” will follow
“Collits’ Inn” on to the revolving stage
at Melb. Princess at Easter. This is the
first time in living memory that one Aus-
tralian musical comedy has been suc-
ceeded by another Australian musical
comedy. Robert Chisholm, George Wal-
lace, Frank Harvey and the Moncrieff
will be the stars of the Thring produc-
tion.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Jasby”: It was the habit of a Scotch
farmer to drive into a northern S.A.
town every Saturday afternoon to get
tight. His object achieved, he would
clamber uncertainly into his cart; his old
nag could be trusted to get him safely
home. But one afternoon wags unhar-
nessed it and led it away, and propped up
the shafts. In the evening the perplexed
owner, seated in the cart, appealed to
passers-by. “Am Ah Jock Tamson? Am
Ah JockTamson?” he kept asking. Pressed
for an explanation, he confided: “Weel,
if Ah’m Jock Tamson Ah’ve lost a
hor-rse; but if Ah’m no’ Jock Tam-
son, Ah’ve found a car-rt.”
* * * *
“Woolly Bakblox”: Our Westralian
pool has been visited lately by an albino
galah. Coloring on breast, under-wings,
and —in a lesser degree —up the neck and
round the head is the usual salmon pink ;
the rest is snow-white. The bird does
not differ in any way from the ordinary
galah. When seen among hundreds of
others it stands out as a flashing patch of
white. I have lived, in galah country for
40 years, and must have seen millions,
but haven’t seen or heard of one like this.

irrigation area during the 1919 drought.
Scotty had taken up a block with a
brand-new house on it. One hot day his
dog Sneezer raised a goanna. The yellow-
and-black streak went up the wall of
Scotty’s new house and, hitting the gut-
tering with some force, fell back into the
tank. Steve, Scotty’s neighbor, came over.
“Scotty,” he said, “you can’t shoot him
without blowing holes in your tank, and
you can’t leave him there to peg out unless
you want to give your rainwater a flavor
—that is, when we get some rain. How
about putting Sneezer in with him?”
“No bloomin’ fear,” said Scotty. “I’ll
get in myself and lay him out with a
waddy.” In he went, but the go. took
Scotty for a tree and Scotty missed at
every hit. The tank fell off the stand,
and Sneezer hopped through the
manhole into the fray; the go. seeing
daylight, made for it, and climbed up
Steve, who had hitherto been shouting
encouragement. Steve set out for the
horizon, met an irrigation channel full
of water on the way, and there parted
from his rider, on which Sneezer
pounced. At the post-mortem Scotty-
remarked: “I’d have had the blighter
sooner if it hadn’t been for his
color. He travelled round that tank so
fast that every time I made a welt at the
yellow snake I just missed the black one.”
* * * *
“Waiwera”: A 12in. brown trout caught
in the Manawatu River (M.L.) was found
to have a child’s bangle encircling its
middle-piece. The bangle must have
been a tight fit when it first lodged on
the fish, for it had by his subsequent
growth cut severely into the flesh, and at
the backbone and lower part of the
stomach had carved an open groove half
an inch deep. Bangle and trout will
find a home in a museum.
* * * *
“Comboyuro Kid”: Cutting up an old
casuarina log on a beach on the Humpy
Bong (Q.) peninsula, I located a colony
of the big white grubs beloved by blacks.
Nothing wonderful in that, of course ;
but the log was saturated with salt water,
which had penetrated far up the passage-
ways hacked out by the grubs. Quite
obviously the old tree-trunk had been in
the water for many weeks, possibly many
months, drifting about in Moreton Bay
till a heavy south-easter landed it on the
beach. Apparently a long bath in salt
water and the rolling of the log in many
a tideway made no difference to this big
borer. My first thought was teredo, but
a crosscut revealed fine healthy grubs.
* * * *
“Thrune”: At a sale in our N.S.W.
town the auctioneer was extolling the
merits of a young horse in the yard.
“Unbroken!” the strident voice pro-
claimed, and a deadbeat who had wan-
dered in from nowhere opened his eyes.
“Unbroken!” he murmured. “Wonder
how they pulled his tail?” As he re-
lapsed against the fence he concluded:
“S’pose they pulled it as he went past.”
I made discreet inquiries and found that
the horse had been handled, but was so
fractious that the owner decided to pass
him on. Only to the observant did the
tail tell a tale.
* * * *
“Mundowie”: Black brother is rarely
seen with animals other than dogs,
unless he is a bloated capitalist and has
a horse to ride or drive. The abo. vil-
lage on the reserve at Pooncarie, near
the Darling, has a waggonette and a pair
of horses —a community turnout. Farther
west, near the Warri Warri, a small party
of blacks had a goat, which followed
them wherever they went. One of the
piccaninnies had lost its mother, and the
goat was substituted. A couple who cir-
culated about Mount Browne always
drove from camp to camp and station
to station with their own horse and
spring-cart. It was said that Jacky owned
“Some of the countries we visited were so hot the women only wore a few
beads.”
“Of perspiration?”
the cart and Maggie the horse. She
paid £l2 for him, all in two-shilling
pieces.
* * * *
“Gilbulla”: Rapid changes of color in
accordance with surroundings are affected
by cold-blooded creatures —lizards, frogs,
fishes, cuttlefishes, Crustacea, even (very
occasionally) insects. Some species of
small prawns are of exceptional interest
in this respect. Of nocturnal habits, they
sleep in the daytime among seaweeds,
automatically adjusting their coloring to
black, brown, green, yellowish-green or
reddish, according to their background.
At night a transformation takes place;
all become a transparent azure blue.
When daylight comes the blue tint fades
and they change again.
“Mungo McAmundsen”: This is from
“John o’ London’s”:
I have been told that an explorer in
wild regions, say in Central Australia,
can get along perfectly well if he knows
only 120 words of the native language.
Can you tell me where to find a list of
these 120 words?—E. A., Birmingham.
One may subsist in Centralia with fewer
than 120 words, and albeit the language
is agglutinative it is not difficult. The
following typical dialogue will enable
“E.A.” to converse on any topic
relevant to the region, even among its
most cultured inhabitants. The local
chief, upon meeting him, will remark:
“Plurri-ot. Kanyakeepwundown?” to
which the courteous answer is “Mimuddi-
oath!” The visitor will then be con-
ducted to the local place of ceremonies,
where, after refreshment, his cicerone
will say: “Gotne-mail! ” Answer: “Onli-
muddiyinkumtacks! ” “’Skow!” his host
will say politely; “Rainyuwey?” The
man from the Bull Ring city, unless he
wants to see a native suffering from
apoplectic astonishment, will mutter
hurriedly, after spitting: “Nottaflameen
poin!” He will then add: “Beer-sot.
Whaddabowtanotha?” “ ’Shokaybimee-
boi,” the courtly old mamoose will reply.
And after a second draught of Centralian
ichor, “E.A.” won’t give a London fog
what anyone says.
* * * *
“Blackfish”: Let me settle that argu-
ment. North of the Dividing Range (Vic.)
a blackfish rarely exceeds lib. In the
Tarwin River, Gippsland, 41b. blackfish
have been caught. I was one of a party
of three who fished there last Christmas,
and fish weighing 21b., and lib.
were caught. Several true blackfish can
be seen at a pretty tea gardens at Nath-
alia Springs, near Belgrave, about 28
miles from Melbourne. The owner calls
the three largest by name, waves his hand
in the water and feeds them with worms,
and they swim into the palm of his hand.
He lifts the largest out for inspection and
replaces it; sizes, 61b., 51b. and 41b. He
has several others over 21b.
* * * *
“Frig”: “Jerry” (B. 7/3/’34) asks why
old hands still put turkey-red in kero-
sene table lamps. Because nothing beats
it as a filter and as an aid to giving out
a clear, bright light.
# * * *
“Sister”: At dawn we made Port
Moresby harbor. High in the clouds
glistened Lady Mt. Victoria in her day-
robe of misted silver. Across the waters
of burning blue came the Lakatoi fleet,
with its crab-claw sails, and kikennis
prancing their heathen dances on the
swaying platforms round the masts,
whilst the young braves swung out over
the sea on lengths of lawyer-vines
secured to the mastheads. The old
Papuan hand told us that every Sep-
tember the Lakatois go west to trade clay
cooking-pots for sago, returning in
March, when the monsoon has blown
itself out. He also told us that high up
on the plateaus of the hills grow the
most beautiful buttercups and daisies;
and that the native girls up there have
rosy cheeks.
* * * *
“Moturoa”: Met the brother of
Henare, mentioned by “O. W. Waireki’
(B. 28/2/’34), on the Taupo road during
the Christmas holidays. His ancient car
had stuck him up. Asked why he had
removed his boots, he replied: “So’s I
won’t kick te proomin’ t’ing to bits!”
Judging by the decrepit state of the car
and the weight and size of the native’s
footwear, one could realise that his fears
were well founded.
THE SAND-DUNES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Silver are the sand-dunes, running to the sunrise,
Sloping where the white mists wander and
unfurl;
Till the sky and shoreline, welded into one, rise
In unsubstantial ramparts of amethyst and
pearl,,
In terraces of pearl.
Golden are the sand-dunes, glimmering east and
nor’ward,
Always through their corridors the ocean
croons,
Always through the thicket and the thin boughs
shoreward
Sing the surf and the sea-wind, on summer
afternoons,
The long, blue afternoons.
Rosy are the sand-dunes, riven into crazy
Stairways and hollows by the high salt gales,
Dappled with the sword-grass and pale sea-
daisy ;
, And dreaming through the day long the old
sea tales,
The deep-sea tales.
Lonely are the sand-dunes, leaning to the sun-
set,
With the salt wind rising in the old sad runes,
Eerie as the seas are at evening’s purple onset,
Where golden day is dying o’er the grey
sand-dunes,
The haunted summer dunes.

THE PRIZE PAR.
The guinea paid to the writer of the
“Aboriginality” adjudged the best sent
in by a contributor (space rates are
added, and members of the staff are
barred) is awarded this week to Henry
G. Lamond, Proserpine (£>.), for this: —
A point overlooked by those
who’ve been writing about the
virtue and beauty of a calfskin
waistcoat is that the real Mackay
is the skin of an unborn calf —
what we used to call a belly-calf.
I remember a social event at Eulo
(Q.). Flash Bob was there with a
five-pound note slipped through a
bone ring as a necktie. Harry Bird
shone with half-sovereigns for but-
tons. But I was the bloke who
drew most attention —the fellow’
that strutted with his tail well over
his back when he walked. I had
had the skin of a brindle belly-calf
made into a waistcoat. It was as
soft as silk, and rippled flashes of
flame as the light struck it. Take
my tip, / was the beau of the ball
as we swung to corners after first
ladies had visited second gents.


“Bogaduck”: I looked at the wife’s
list of requirements, and found it in-
cluded six cakes of Bifeloy soap. “You
had six last week,” I protested ; and she
replied that it had all vanished, at the
rate of a cake a night. That night I put
a fresh cake in the bathroom and hid
behind the door. Towards midnight my
little boy’s pet billygoat came sneaking
in, took the soap in his mouth and tip-
toed out. I followed, to see him splash
a lot of water out of the horse-trough,
lay the soap on the patch of grass he
had wetted, and roll on it. I rushed at
him with a stick. But he stopped me with
a pathetic “Mah-ah” and an appealing
look, trotted away and returned with a
piece of newspaper. By the light of the
moon I read it—an advt. for Bifeloy
soap beginning “Why do the girls avoid
you? Young man, you have B.O.” I
then remembered that the people next
door had recently bought a young and
charming nannygoat, and understood.
Next morning I made a point of buying
a bottle of bath salts especially for
Romeo. The gratitude in that poor dumb
brute’s eyes when I handed them to him
was really pathetic.
* * * *
“Walkabout”: It happened at a shed
near Winton (Q.). The engine-driver,
failing to turn up after a hectic week-
end in town, was sacked, and a bagman
with diplomas galore was given the job.
“More pace!” yelled the shearers during
the first run. Suddenly the shed started
to vibrate, and a headlong rush was made
for safety. “What the devil have you
done?” yelled the boss. “They was yell-
in’ fer more pace,” explained the expert,
“so I reckoned this was acting as a break
and I whipped it off.” He pointed to the
governor belt.
* * * *
“Fido”: A new meaning has been
given to the term “sporting dog” at Lyttel-
ton (M.L). A three-mile swimming race
“I s’pose y’re pleased y’r daughter has become engaged to a p’liceman.”
"I should say sol Why, the ol’ man ain’t bin in the lockup for a fortnight!”
(a handicap event) was in progress.
Samuel, a black spaniel, watched the
start with avid interest. Competitor after
competitor got away, and at last only the
scratch man waited in solitary magni-
ficence. Then his turn came, and he
dove in and turned himself into a human
torpedo. Samuel decided that one
more competitor, from behind scratch,
wouldn’t do the race any harm, so he
took off, too, diving neatly and swimming
strongly. For about 30 yards it looked as
if he would overhaul the other back-
marker, but it dawned on Samuel at this
stage that this wasn’t a sprint event, and
with a despairing yelp he turned round
and slowly paddled back to the steps
whence he had sprung. “I should think
so!” said the starter to Samuel severely.
“Don’t you ever dare to start in a race
again unless you have a medical certi-
ficate ! ” And Samuel slunk away, a
small, dark figure, utterly abased.

“Frig”: Rust-preventing waters (B.
14/3 / ’34)? There is a 40ft. well on
Tarreloroi station, near Barcaldine (Q.X
the water of which is cold as ice and soft.
A bag of carpenter’s tools was dredged
from the bottom —it had been immersed
for 15 years. Not a trace of rust was
found on a single tool.
* * * *
“Bidgee”: The pearl mentioned by
“Nakh” (B. 28/2/’34) is not the first
fresh-water pearl to be discovered in
Australia, as my mother wears one
found in the Murrumbidgee ten years
ago. About the size of a small pea, it is
a handsome specimen, tinged with a slight
pinkish hue. The mussel was embedded
in sand ; its shell was beautifully colored
in sunset shades of pink and blue. The
gem is of little commercial value.
“L.A.S.”: The emu on a
new two-shilling piece I have
is a strange-looking rooster
to a bushman. Its neck is
not nearly long enough, and
gives it a funny squat appear-
ance. The bird seems to be
standing on one leg, and it
is the only emu in the wide
world with a spur on the
back of its foot. It is impos-
sible to get the correct pose
of an emu with that short
neck. Perhaps it has been
built thus to tally with the
’roo opposite. But even he
looks suspicious about its architecture.

“Spiriifex”: “O. de V.” (B. 7/3/’34)
notwithstanding, most prads will get used
to camels. On a station near Kajabbi
(N.Q.), I have seen a cow camel suckling
a motherless foal and a mare suckling
a camel calf. Around the Dobbyn, where
Abdul pastures many of his fence-break-
ing beasts along the Leichhardt River, I
have mustered cattle, and our horses took
much less notice of the camels than they
usually did of a passing car. Still, I
wouldn’t care to drive a horse-camel
tandem.

“Jack’s Track”: It’s uncanny how
lightning strikes station gallows-posts. I
shifted my killing-pen further and further
towards the boundary to try to avoid
the under-the-bed complex during storms;
but my neighbors got nasty at last about
my splintered posts spearing their cattle.
After some consideration I bought an
endless chain and hung it up on a green
gum-tree sheltered behind a huge rock.
It dodged a couple of storms, but the
last filled the valley with hell. The flying
chain swept off three chimneys, ploughed
through the woolshed and parked the lot
in the river. In future we’ll do the killing
on the hide.
* * * *
“Frigid”: A sparrow took possession
of an old swallow’s nest and had laid
some eggs in it before the original owner
appeared and claimed possession. The
sparrow objected, and a battle ensued,
DAD : "That’s wot yer get for puttin’ goanna oil in the ingine!”
during which the swallow was joined by
her mate. In time, a number of swallows
joined in, but they could not get rid of the
usurper. The attackers retired to a neigh-
boring tree to consider how they could
best punish the sparrow. Then, after
quitting the scene of the contest for a
time, they returned in much larger num-
bers, each bearing a beakful of building
materials, and without any further
attempt to turn out the sparrow they set
to work to build up the entrance of the
nest. They soon accomplished this, en-
closing the sparrow with clay and leaving
her to perish in the fortress she had so
bravely defended.
* * * *
“Kismet”: Angus Macdonald, of the
Overland Telegraph staff, 72 miles from
the nearest station and accompanied only
by a native boy, went fishing with dyna-
mite. It exploded in his hand and blew
it off. The boy bolted. Angus tied up
the bleeding stump, got on his horse and
rode back to the station. When the
message came through to Thursday Island
Hospital a launch was sent across to meet
the whaleboat in which, they were bring-
ing him over. Three days later he
arrived, and only when they laid him
on the beach below the little hospital did
he give way. He fainted.
* * * *
“Sister”: In my little grass house near
the top of the Lakekamu Ranges (Papua)
I seemed to be alone in the world. One
night, when the evening rain had ceased
for a while, I walked towards the open
window space, and there came towards
me the gigantic form of a woman. Fifty
or sixty times greater than lifesize, it was.
When I stood it stood ; when I started
back it did the same. Into my mind crept
half-forgotten things I had read about
the Brocken. Would it eat me alive?
No, it began to drift past, and as it did
I saw that it was myself, outlined and
magnified against a cloud.
* * * *
“C Coral”: As “Yarri” (B. 14/2/’32)
says, a good many people have kicked
themselves for having failed to recognise
a valuable chunk of ambergris; but the
stuff isn’t so easy to spot as may be
imagined. I have had several pieces
shown to me as “dinkum,” but the Tech.
Museum’s verdict was either “fat from
the cook’s slush bucket” or “apparently
lumps of soap.” I have handled the real
article, but it was nothing like anything
that had been described. A scientific
friend tells me you should look for indi-
cations of the cuttlefish beaks which the
manufacturing whale has been unable to
digest.
* * * *
“Wanderer”: Travelling through the
Gulf country recently, two of us called
at a homestead on the Leichhardt
River. Built of the inevitable corrugated
iron, and erected on four-foot piles, it
was typical of the buildings in that stretch
of country. We were hailed by an old
warrior who was on the verandah.
“Good day, boys,” he sang out. “Glad
to see yer. Slip yer packs and saddles
off and turn yer horses out in the pad-
dock.” He had us moving in no time.
“Come on, lads, get yer feet under this
table. Haven’t got much, as times are
hard in the cattle game, but we’ve tons
of eggs. What about some?” At this
time eggs were, to us, sweet memories of
the past. The old chap turned round to
his grandson. “Boy, cook ’em a dozen
each.” In spite of our protests, they
were placed before us, together with beef,
vegetables and damper. Our host
wouldn’t hear of us continuing our jour-
ney that afternoon, and gave us the run
of the place while we stayed. Such is the
rough, whole-hearted hospitality of the
Gulf cattlemen.

“W.P.T.”: Ned Foy was trying to sell
a dog, and to push the sale he offered
to show the others in the pub how it
would collect the mail from the postman
and bring it to him. A man with a foot-
ball-referee’s whistle offered to act as
postman. He walked outside, blew his
whistle, and held out a letter. The dog
took' it in his mouth, but dropped it
down a drainpipe. “He’s a failure,” the
barman told Ned, and sneered. “Just a
minute till I have a look at that letter,”
Ned replied, and with a stick he raked
it out. “Thought so,” he said, after
examination ; “it’s a bill. I’ve taught him
never ter bring me a bill; and you’ve all
seen what he does with ’em. Cripes, he’s
a dog in a million!”

“Pick”: Fishing at the “Block Up,”
Shoalhaven River (N.S.W.), one chilly
night we fired a stack of logs and debris
that ages of floods had piled thereabouts.
The effect was startling. Roaring through
the mountain of summer-dried tinder, the
tornado of flame swept gum boughs and
ferns from its path and licked the moun-
tain-tops half a mile away. Startled by
the sudden illumination, howling dingoes
fled from the hillsides. Uttering guttural
coughs, ’possums scampered from the
trees. Wallabies tore around the cliffs,
and so many snakes and lizards slithered
into our fishing hole that no room was
left for our lines. So intense became the
confined heat that soon we, too, were
forced to retreat and shelter behind a
distant mountain buttress. In the morn-
ing we returned, to find the landscape
entirely changed. And a crumbling ash-
heap lay where the day before had stood
a monument to mark the power of the
river.

“Moturoa”: Elephants are not always
grateful (B. 28/2/’34). When Wirths’
circus was camped at the rear of the
Railway Hotel, Palmerston North (M.L.),
some years ago, a couple of flax-cutters
on the spree amused themselves trying
to get one of the elephants drunk. Bottle
after bottle of beer was handed over and
the contents were swallowed with gusto.
Eventually the roysterers’ patience (and
cash) ran out, and a bottle of water was
substituted for beer. The elephant
hoisted it high with its trunk and began
to swallow. It desisted all of a sudden
and threw the bottle at the practical
joker. The latter stopped it with his chest,
and spent three months in hospital.
A BUSH SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Make me a song of the homesteads standing
Where horses gallop and whips ring clear,
A rhyme of the mustering and the branding
And the loaded waggons of yesteryear.
Build me a stave of the cattle calling
Where clovers glisten with morning dews,
Or a verse that tells of the white rain falling
To the bleat of the far-off lambs and ewes.
Weave me a lilt of the campfires glowing,
Of timbered gullies and mountains high;
Of the rushing creeks and the rivers flowing,
And the lasting blue of our autumn sky.
Sing of September magpies sending
Their glad notes down from the guarded nest,
With music of pines and the she-oaks blending—
And there’s the song that I’ll love the best.
N.S.W.
JIM DOWLIKG.

SPRING AND
SUMMER
SYDNEY HAS AN
IRRESISTIBLE APPEAL TO
HOLIDAY MAKERS.
Blue skies, a considerate sun, scintillating
ocean and harbor, clean, brilliant, safe
beaches call you now. Gorgeous gardens
and miles of orchards and farms in their spring
settings add to your pleasure. The Metropole is
in close juxtaposition to all these—as to all theatrical
and picture and other pleasure resorts. Sydney’s shops
with their displays are reached by tram. Winter Garden
with Orchestra. Terms from 6/6 per night (room only)
you will combine with economy the greatest comfort. Service is
not the slogan—it is the practice.

CULPRITSON RULES.
. “The best way to play cards is to play cards
is t 0”...
Exactly; this is a point that should
be remembered by those to whom cards
are either a religion or an amusement.
It is considered bad form, after a partner
has led the ace of spades, to turn away
from the table and play the saxophone.
“Let says it’ll cost a guinea to fix him up, sir.”
“A guinea; an’ I paid fifteen bob fer ’im as ’e stands!
Too ’ot!”
It may be disconcerting to the opponents,
but it is liable to upset the partner, too.
Of course even the most sedate players
play up at times, but at all respectable
card tables it is considered bad taste to
play dominoes, noughts-and-crosses, ping
pong or polo.
Only the other night, having four aces
and a long suit of diamonds, a partner
of mine thought he would play old Harry
in no-trumps. He went down four,
doubled and redoubled; and we had
to play Scotch for the rest of the evening.
In playing cards it is undoubtedly best
to play cards—your own cards for pre-
ference. After all, the game’s the thing.

THE DELAYED TESTIMONIAL.
The Dry Creek celebrations in con-
nection with old Dougal McSnatch’s
100th birthday were in full swing. City
reporters ran the hero of the occasion
to earth and asked the secret of his
longevity.

A stir went round the conference room
as Mr. Butler read the telegram. His
expression of gloom had vanished.
Menzies couldn’t contain his curiosity.
“What is it, Layton, old boy?” he asked.
“Wheat up to four bob a bushel? Or
have they decided to extend your term
to ten years?”
“Bradman’s coming to Adelaide,” was
the ecstatic answer. Stevens was seen to
stamp angrily. Menzies and Forgan Smith
rushed to shake the
S.A. statesman by
the hand.
Collier remained
seated. “I don’t
hold with this
trafficking in play-
ers,” he snorted.
“Take Bromley—a

cried Joe Lyons.

At this moment
he was handed a

turned on Butler,
his face ashen.
“Well, that’s past a joke,”, he stormed.
“So you’re trying to steal Badcock, too!
Poor little Tassie is being bled dry by
the other States. Infernal swindle! ”
But Butler and Menzies were walking
in the direction of the bar. As they left
Stevens fired a parting shot at the S.A.
Premier. “Mind the Cricket Association
doesn’t swap you for Badcock.”

test possible State Governors and a
Sunday dinner for trying out mothers-in-
law?
Then the Church might consider after-
noon-tea parties for budding curates,, and

MANY USES.
“Seeing and hearing are not the only uses of
the eye and ear respectively.”— “Telegraph.”
Of course not. The eye is handy to
close when sleeping or to wink when a
wink is better than a nod. Colored ones
provide a living for jazz-song writers, and
for weeping the eye is without a rival.
Then there’s the ear, nature’s pen-
holder. Some people play music by it,
some bite it and others loudly repeat it at
public meetings. Politicians find ears
very handy when dealing with complaints.
They allow them to go in one and out
of the other.

THE MASQUERADERS.

as useful citizens, typists are posing as
etymologists, and a survey of the cur-
rent numbers of local magazines dis-
closes 99 examples of metrical compo-
sition signed “Homer.”

ingly sustaining the decep-
tion that he was a certain

been pestering the Little

royalties on revivals of
“Hamlet” and “The Tem-

said that the societies
objected most to Shak-

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Three-year-olds are going to play a big
part in the Randwick racing at Easter.
Dromos may be heard of in the Don-
caster. He has 7st. 51b. in that race ;
he carried 7st. 111 b. to victory in the
Parramatta Mile at Rosehill after having
been backed from sevens to fives. Tat-
yoon and Gloriole cut at each other.
They had had enough at the Leger, where
Ramrod took charge. He was no match
for Dromos, who beat him comfortably
by a neck, with Wedding Feast third.
Ramadan, who had scored the previous
week, gave his backers a poor run, but
Serabite may pick up a minor race
shortly.
Another three-year-old with a Don-
caster engagement (she has 7st. 121 b.) to
do well was the Adrian Knox Stakes
winner Leila Vale. Still, she looked lucky
to beat Bill Wedgewood in the Railway
Handicap ; Bill also has 7st. 121 b. in the
Doncaster. Starting at 20 to 1, Booth’s
filly took charge in the straight, and just
held off Bill Wedgewood, who, after
being hopelessly placed in the first fur-
long, galloped very fast from the Leger.
Silver Scorn was third, just ahead of
Whittingham, who is now being trained
by G. Price for the shipping man who
races under the name of “G. Lightford.”
The Maoriland mare was so far behind
Leila Vale and Bill Wedgewood that

those who have supported her in the big
mile have lost hope.
Chatham was another favorite who went
down. There was no possible excuse for
his defeat in the Rawson Stakes. He
had the run of the race on the rails. But
Lough Neagh kept worrying him from
the first furlong to the turn, and Chat-
ham was really the first horse beaten.
When Lough Neagh took charge he was
proclaimed the winner, but Rogilla (3
to 1), with the last run, finished brilliantly
to beat Peter Pan (20 to 1), who, after
meeting with slight interference when
Rogilla made his run on the outside,
pipped Lough Neagh for second. Chat-
ham was fourth and Blixten last. Rogilla
h'as 9st. 51b. in the Doncaster, and is
now favorite.
Leila Vale’s stable-mate Tingalba was
backed from sixes to fours for the Rose-
hill Autumn Handicap, and made the
opposition look very mediocre. The
result was not in doubt at any stage.
Young Zensky got a break on the field at
each turn, and it was left to Tremayne
and Miss Nottava to chase the Treclare
gelding home. Lavington was favor-
ite, but the hot pace set by Tingalba was
not to his liking, and Oro was another
who had enough before the serious busi-
ness began. Tingalba has now won three
races at Rosehill in as many starts. Un-
fortunately for Booth, he is not in the
Sydney Cup.
Trainer Peter Riddle has a lease of
Windbird until 1936, and judging by his
finish in the Three-year-old Handicap
the Magpie colt is going to prove profit-
able. Going out at 14 to 1, he came
fast after being a long way out of his
ground in the early stages to beat Pat-
wood and the pacemaker Mafoota. The
favorite, Fleet, was fourth, and the dis-
appointing Deputy Ruler sixth. W. Pear-
son bought the chestnut thinking he
might turn out another Amounis.
Dominion sire Limond was well repre-
sented in the Nursery. In the first divi-
sion two of his stock, Gladswood (5 to
2) and Theo, fought out a great finish,
and Limyris, another Limond, won the
second heat. Gladswood was bought as
a yearling by John Spencer Brunton, and
carries the colors of Mrs. Brunton, who
named the colt after their home at
Double Bay. Fie cost 400 guineas, and
is a three-quarter brother to Veilmond,
but he is much smaller than the latter.
Limyris (10 to 1) did her job in runaway
fashion. She brought 310 guineas as a
yearling, and has won two races at Rose-
hill. She is a sister to Pomp, who
was brilliant in his day.

back readers who have written and tele-
graphed, The Bulletin’s present fancies

* * * *
Jumping events furnished the greatest
excitement at Caulfield. Only four horses
competed in the Narong Hurdle, and
they finished in pairs. Walter Scott and
Nyerimilang dead-heated for first and
second money, while the judge awarded
another dead-heat for third place between
Bridge and Bow and Jason. To make
matters merrier still, Sandiford, the rider
of Nyerimilang, lodged a protest against
Walter Scott for interference in the
straight. Consideration of the objection
was protracted. Forming the opinion
that it would be upheld, bookmakers laid
sto 1 against Walter Scott. Notwith-
standing the hoisting of the “Protest Dis-
missed” semaphore, McShortodds with-
held payment of bets that were laid after
the horses passed the post. Wrangling
on the question became rife, and had not
terminated at the close of the afternoon.
Many parties to the dispute left the
course ignorant that the stipendiary stew-
ards had ruled that backers of Walter
Scott on the protest were entitled to
collect.
Nyerimilang would have won the race
outright if (1) he had not sacrified six
or eight lengths by almost unseating
Sandiford at a hurdle near the nine-
furlong post, and (2) if he had been able
to get a clear run on the rails after the
last obstacle was negotiated. Sandiford
took a risk in attempting to get his
mount through on the inside of Walter
Scott, who appeared to squeeze the King
Ingoda gelding rather seriously. Presum-
ably the stewards reckoned that Sandi-
ford had contributed to the trouble by
trying to force an opening.
Nyerimilang was presented to J. A.
MacLeod by Philip Russell, a fellow-
committeeman of the V.R.C. Walter
Scott belongs to F. E. Shillabeer, chair-
man of the Victorian Club committee,
whose colors were carried into a place on
four successive occasions by Shadow
King in the Melbourne Cup. Hynes, the
former Sydney jockey, rode Walter
Scott. He sustained a severe fall off that
horse at Williamstown in the spring of
1932.
Sandiford landed the Gordon Steeple-
chase on Calfly, an experienced timber-
topper. Six of the ten competitors failed
to finish. The favorite, Appledore, broke
down early in the race. The Cracks-
man, who is engaged in the Onkaparinga
Steeplechase on Easter Monday, clouted
his rider out of the saddle at the mile-
post.
Holt, the trainer of Hall Mark, had
mixed luck at Caulfield. Heros, his re-
presentative in the South Yarra Handi-
cap, lost to Yellowstead by a neck, but
Nuit d’Or evened up matters by annex-
ing the Übique Welter. Cramped odds
had to be accepted about both Heros and
Nuit d’Or. Holt is searching industri-
ously for a jockey capable of filling the
vacancy caused by Duncan being com-
pelled to retire from the saddle. Skid-
more had the mounts on Heros and Nuit
d’Or. It looks as if he will do a lot of
riding for the Mordialloc trainer. Nuit
d’Or belongs to Philip Russell, who bred
the colt. The example of Russell in
according patronage to Holt has been
followed by Alan Currie, vice-chairman
of the V.R.C., who has sent to him the
Equator colt Equerry.
Yellowstead and Heros were followed
home in the South Yarra Handicap by
Vauntry, winner of the Maribyrnong
Plate of 1931, and a first-acceptor for
the Doncaster Handicap. The form of
Vauntry was encouraging. He finished
only half a length behind Heros. D. J.
Price, his trainer, has Flail engaged in the
Sydney Cup, and it may be presumed
that he will make the trip to Randwick.
Three years ago Dave Price gained
second honors in the Sydney Cup with
Aleman, who carried the colors in which
Vauntry is racing. Last season Flail was
runner-up to Topical in the Australian
Cup and to Kuvera in the King’s Cup,
which was staged at Flemington. Flail’s
impost in the King’s Cup this year is
41b. less than it was 12 months ago.
Golden Wings, the Maoriland sprinter,
did not enhance his Doncaster prospects
by failing in the South Yarra Handicap.
His behavior at the post always is bad.
On this occasion he jumped away smartly
and led for a short distance, but could
finish fourth only.
sjc sfc * ♦
Sydney owners and trainers are growl-
ing about the prizes offered by clubs
other than the A J.C.; and no wonder!
Compare the stakes put up at Rosehill
and Caulfield on Saturday. For the St.
Kilda Handicap the V.A.T.C. distributed
£7oo—£2oo more than the money added
to the Rawson Stakes. The Orrong Two-
year-old was worth £IOO more than the
boodle for which Rogilla, Chatham and
Peter Pan competed. Owners of the first
three in the Rosehill Autumn Handicap
divided £2OO ; the hurdle race, the steeple-
chase and the Übique Welter at Caulfield
were each £4OO affairs. Racing is much
less popular in Sydney than it is in Mel-
bourne. Niggardliness on the part of
proprietary clubs is largely to blame.
* * * *
It is a good thing to have a King’s Cup
race on a programme ; but it makes other
races less attractive to owners. When
first acceptances closed last week only
29 horses were left in the Sydney Cup,
and there is a saddening percentage of
rubbish. For the King’s Cup, on the
other hand, the owners of 40 horses cried
content. The list includes Peter Pan,
Rogilla, Kuvera and Hall Mark —all out
of the Sydney Cup.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Bobby Delaney and Jack O’Brien, who
were to have fought a return bout at
Sydney some months ago, have held it
at last—at Brisbane. It was a 15-round
draw.
H* Sfc ♦ *
“Bumpk”: Primo Camera is nothing
if not a patriot. He was engaged to fight
Max Baer in M.-G.-M.’s “Every Woman’s
Man.” Being the hero, Baer was expected
to win, but Primo threw out his mighty
chest and said that such things could not
be. When M.-G.-M. flourished a £SOOO
roll in his face, however, the bruiser
decided that defeat would not be dis-
grace. It must have been the biggest fee
ever taken by a boxer for allowing him-
self to suffer a stage knock-out.
* * * *
Beth’s opponent at Leichhardt on
Saturday was billed as a Cossack, Kip-
pastro Razgon, but looked more like a
retired policeman, Casey. Beth beat him
in five rounds, and could evidently have
settled him in five seconds. Tom Lurich
also took five rounds to defeat Walter
Browning at Newtown. With the return
of Saturday-night fights at the Stadium
these worthies will have to go on their
travels again.

Ins and Outs
Kippax, 141 in even time, did best in
the mainlanders’ second match against
the Speck. The opening pair, Woodfull
and Brown, put on another double cen-
tury: Woodfull, 124 ; Brown, 98. Scores:
Australia, 501 ; Tasmania, 338 and eight
for 124. Of the bowlers Wall was most
successful, taking 10 wickets for 159;
in his second try he got 5 for 47.
o Continued on page 26.)
The Nineteenth Hole
“Minus 10”: W. Bolger’s feat in tour-
ing the Oatlands course in 75 last week,
using nothing but a putter, demonstrates
once more the idiocy of the loaded bag.
It is not unusual to see rabbits with a
dozen clubs. I played recently with one
whose undersized caddie had to hump
no fewer than 15. Five clubs (driver,
brassie or spoon, iron, mashie and putter)
are enough for any normal player on any
normal course ; and in most cases there
would be no harm in dispensing with
the iron. Bolger would have put up
much better figures with a mashie, which
would have given him distance even if
it had caused him to be slightly less
deadly on the greens.
* * * *
“Smarm”: Royal Sydney associates,
led by Joan Hammond, swept the board
at the L.G.U. Bowral meeting. In a
sense the ever-growing strength of the
great Rose Bay club is a calamity. Cer-
tain golfers—chiefly social climbers re-
gard it as their Mecca. As soon as they
achieve proficiency in the game they
start manoeuvring to get out of their own
clubs and into the supposedly better one,
and if they go about it with sufficient
resolution and tact they may succeed. In
theory, of course, Royal Sydney would
scorn to pinch those who have made
their golfing names elsewhere, but theory
is not always practice.
(Continued on page 26.)
Stroked by the Melburnian Sambell,
Cambridge won the University boatrace
for the eleventh time in succession by
4-’- lengths. The time, 18min. 3sec., was
a record; Oxford also beat the previous
best, which had stood since 1911. “The
most polished and powerful crew ever
seen in the race,” London “Observer
says of Sambell and his lads.
* * * *
In a teams’ race at Canterbury Velo-
drome (Sydney), in which eight couples
shared 44 miles of battling, the English
pro. S. T. Cozens, partnered by Keith
Oliver (Tas.), was successful. There were
sprint points to be competed for every
two miles, and between the 11th and the
16th mile the Cozens team and a Sydney
pair (Platt and Morgan) lapped the field,
the Englishman being first over the line
at the finish. A half-mile match race
in four heats between Cozens and J.
Fitzgerald and R. J. Beer, representing
Australia, was won by Fitzgerald on
points.

one thousand miles “up the bush,” there by the
roadside you will find Vacuum products at
your service.
Next Winter business may call you far inland
Summer may find you by the sea but
Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter you will
find Vacuum products there, and of the same,
never-varying high quality, uniform,
dependable.
Our success depends on our ability to serve
you we realise that. So throughout the 39
years of this Company’s service in Australia
we have been constantly striving with one end
in view to enable you to go, Anywhere
by making our products available, Everywhere.
This has been accomplished by years of careful,
planning, and by the expenditure of huge sums
of money so that supplies of fuel and oil for
car, cycle, aeroplane or whatever form of
transport you may use —will be right there,
when and where you need them most.
This unfailing provision of necessary products
has built up a reputation for the Company—
you, yourself, may have had frequent
opportunities to judge the uniformity and
availability of Vacuum products and service.
Thus the Vacuum Oil Company Pty. Ltd. has
acquired a responsibility as great as its repu-
tation, and upon every Vacuum employee has
devolved the responsibility of carrying on,
unfailingly, the traditions of the Company for
courteous, friendly service.
The reputation we have earned makes us
conscious of our responsibility to you, so the
Company is still striving constantly to make
each day’s service better than the performance
of yesterday.

Australian-bred horses have won nearly
everything worth winning these last two
seasons. Consider this year’s record :
Hall Mark (Heroic —Herowinkie), A.J.C.
Derby, Vic. Derby, Melbourne Cup and
Vic. St. Leger; Chatham (Windbag—
Myosotis), A.J.C. Epsom and a trot of
w.f.a. races ; Foursome (Two —Ethir),
Newmarket Handicap; Heroic Prince
(Heroic —Cooghal), Australian Cup ;
Leila Vale (Heroic —Maltgilla), A.J.C.
Adrian Knox Stakes; and Soft Step
(Spearfelt—E’en Step), Queensland Cup.
Last season Liberal (Windbag—Charade)
captured Caulfield Guineas and Vic.
Derby ; Winooka (Windbag—Kanooka),
V.A.T.C. Futurity Stakes and A.J.C. Don-
caster ; Chatham, the Epsom; Topical
(Windbag—Parody), Australian Cup ;
Herolage (Heroic —Mucilage), Brisbane
Cup ; Celotex (Salatis —Annexit), Adel-
aide Birthday Cup ; and Hall Mark was
unbeaten in Sydney two-year-old races.
To match those achievements you have
to go back to the days of Wallace and
Maltster.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
(Continued from page 24.)
Queanbeyan (N.S.W.) was a proud
town last week when its Mervyn
(“Darky”) Blandon got all over the Fili-
pino “Speedy” Dado in a 15-rounder at
Sydney Stadium. Blandon, a sturdily-
built bantam who can “take it,” is cham-
pion of Australia at the weight; but that
means nothing nowadays, and the match
against Dado, who has met the best in
the world, was his first important fight.
He punched the Filipino from pillar to
post, and no one disputed the decision in
his favor. Dado wants a return match,
and Brown, the world champion, may
be brought to Australia to meet the
Queanbeyan lad, who is rising 22 and
has been, boxing for three years.
Blandon’s next match is with “Star”
Frisco in Melbourne on April 9.
Ambrose Palmer has two dates to fill at
Sydney Stadium —with Marty Sampson
on March 26, and with Jim Williams on
Easter Monday night. Bobby Delaney
and Wesley Ramey, who checked Jimmy
Kelso’s run of victories, come together
on Easter Saturday.
Racquet and Bawl
Norris Williams is to lead the U.S.
Davis Cup team this year. Hitherto the
team has been controlled by a committee
working much in the manner of the
Aulic Council, which from its snug
retreat in Vienna directed the movements
of the Austrian armies opposed to the
young Napoleon. The breakdown of
Vines in Paris last year is attributed to
the tasks imposed on him by these exact-
ing old gentlemen. Tilden disgustedly
relates that when he and Johnston were
playing J. O. Anderson and Hawkes in
the Davis Cup doubles of 1923 and
looked like going down, a peppery old
party accosted him when he was resting
and ordered him in the name of the
committee to “go to the net more often.”
Tilden’s reply was that he was playing
the game and that the committee could
go to blazes. But that incident did not
stop the ancients from interfering, nor
the U.S.L.T.A. from continuing the pre-
posterous system. Apparently the exodus
into the professional rank has precipi-
tated the change.
* * * *
“Cam Cam”: Cochet is the latest to
give his opinion on the probable win-
ners of the Davis Cup this year. He
plumps for America.
Their doubles team never loses. That is
one match that can be counted already. At
Wimbledon against the holders, I think t
Shields and Allison just as good as Austin
and Perry. It is a toss-up, and the doubles
give U.S.A. the edge. The French? No
chance.
Australia is evidently in the same cate-
gory, but then the Frenchman was speak-
ing at the beginning of a tour of the
States as a professional, and a little
praise goes a long way.

Ins and Outs
Woodfull and his men are each to get
£IOO Australian before boarding the boat
at Fremantle, £350 English during the
tour abroad, and, if they are good boys,
another £l5O Australian when they
return. Manager, treasurer and captain
are to decide whether they have been
good boys. A serious view will be taken
if any lad carries with him a lass, absorbs
too much British beer, appears at any
theatre, music hall or picture palace, gives
lectures, makes records or films, sells or
permits the sale of his autograph, or
absents himself from official functions
without the consent of the manager —
that functionary, the treasurer and cap-
tain will determine what “official func-
tions” are. For tram and taxi fares and
“incidentals” in England, £2 10s. a week
will be allowed. A frugal youth will be
able to save' a bit on this, and unless the
exchange rate flops the £350 English may
be converted at a trifling cost into £437
10s. Australian. What a thing it is to be
an amateur cricketer!
* * * *
It has been suggested when it is too
late that Badcock should be sent to Eng-
land with Woodfull and co. Bromley
had better advisers than the Tassie. Had
he remained in Perth he would have had
no chance in the world of going overseas
this year. But he made tracks for Mel-
bourne, and his passage into representa-
tive cricket was comparatively easy. Bad-
cock stayed on in Tasmania, and for that
reason alone was not considered. He
is now arranging to go to Adelaide, and
may look forward to playing against
the next lot of Englishmen to visit Aus-
tralia —whenever that may be.
There have been two Tasmanians in
touring Australian teams —Burn, in 1890,
and Eady, in 1896. But by 1912 the
impression that Tasmanians can’t play
cricket had become so firmly embedded
in the minds of Australian selectors that
it was plain to McDonald and his friends
that he would have to remove himself
from his native State if he wanted to
become a representative cricketer.
* * * *
“Leirum”: Vic. Country Week cricket
brought W. A. Scott back to notice.
Playing for Echuca, he had four knocks,
and was out once, his scores being 62
n. 0., 2, 71 n.o. and 80 n.o. For Mel-
bourne Uni. against its opposite number
in Adelaide, 1927-30, Scott averaged
276.6. His innings were 107 n. 0., 93 n. 0.,
246 n. 0., 122 run out, 20 and 242. But
he’s slow, and for that reason was given
few chances in pennant cricket.
* * * *
“Sturt”: Some odd results in a tourna-
ment of 21 up-country cricket clubs
played on suburban ovals in Adelaide.
Only one club was not beaten; yet it
finished tenth! Most of its games were
drawn. And the team which finished on
top was such a well-balanced lot that
none of its members appears in the best
dozen of either bats or bowlers for the
eight days.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Pom”: Joe Kirkwood is reported to
have said that golf form in Australia
is equal to British form. It ought to be.
During the past 10 years the cities and
towns of most of the Australian States
have proliferated golf clubs. Sydney, for
example, is ringed with them ; and there
are five within a 20-minute tram ride of
the heart of the city. Most Londoners
never see a golf course, and most of the
outer suburbanites who live near one
(Addington and Walton are examples)
can’t afford to join. It is much the same
in other big British cities. And then there
is the weather. Australia should turn
out a Bobby Jones-before long. All the
conditions precedent are there—an
enormous golfing population, an ideal
climate, short working hours and an
inordinate number of public holidays,
and a press which gives more publicity
to sporting champions than the press of
most countries does to statesmen.
* * * *
“Sandringham”: Victorian golf heads
have decided to hold this year’s State
championships on the Woodland course
at Mordialloc from September 1-7 in
conjunction with the club’s annual open
meeting. Woodlands has spent a lot of
trouble and money on improving its
course and bringing it up to champion-
ship calibre, and the G.A.’s choice indi-
cates that this has not been overlooked.
* * * *
“D.”: Heavy betting has done some-
thing to spoil golf; now comes contract
golf, the invention of one James S.
Manion, of the U.S.A. It is explained
in a booklet published by Allen and
Unwin which has just reached Australia.
The right of first bid is decided by toss-
ing, the winner’s side always bidding at
the odd and the loser’s at the even holes.
This is how team play works out. Part-
ners A and B win the toss and bid the
number of strokes they think they will
take. Say, A 5 and B 6 ; viz., 11. (An
underbid may be doubled, leading to
“How’re you getting on with your Government-relief job?"
heavy penalties.) C and D may now bid
10 —if they think they can do it. A-B
may double and C-D may redouble.
In a lost redouble the penalty for one
above the contract is 4, for two 10, for
three 16 and for four 24 —till 10 is
reached, which sets the duds back no
less than 80. Every feature of contract
bridge can be introduced, not excluding
the psychic bid. The inventor claims that
in his club (the St. Louis) “contract golf
is now played exclusively by all who have
learned the game.”
* *
“Von F.”: Ten years ago there was
hardly a golf course in Germany except
in the vicinity of Berlin. To-day links
are to be found in all parts of the Father-
land. According to a recent cable:
A golf course is being constructed at Wil-
helmshaven to officially encourage naval
officers to learn the game so that they can
mingle more easily with foreigners during
tours abroad.
After tennis and association football, golf
is now Western Europe’s most popular
open-air sport. Oddly enough, France,
which was the first Continental nation to
take to it, has the fewest golf courses
relatively to its size. Only with the
utmost difficulty can the small land-
owners of France be induced to give up
a foot of their sacred soil.
* * * *
“Berwick”: The N. S. Wales G.C. is
having another try to make local golfers
play the game. It proposes to arrange
some talkies showing the perils of defy-
ing what is rather foolishly termed “eti-
quette,” and some of the clubs that need
it least are haying the etiquette rules
printed in their fixture-books. The Bol-
shevik players don’t frequent the estab-
lished clubs to any extent; they are
nearly all recruits from public or semi-
public courses. On links where the
players don’t know one another, and
have no wish to, and have been mulcted
of half-a-crown or more apiece for a
game over fairways like bush paddocks,
old-world courtesy is at a discount.
Players are driven into within a few
minutes of leaving the tees, and balls
whizz past their bowed heads on greens.
I was once driven into by a jocund four-
some of hefty lads who were playing in
the wrong direction! They were on their
way back to the clubhouse by the short-
est route, and didn’t see why they
shouldn’t have a bit of fun en route, so
one said. Every new club acquires scores
of players of this kind as and when it
is formed.
“N.S.W.”: Which is the most beautiful
course in the neighborhood of Sydney?
Many will plump for Leura, with its
fine trees, evergreen fairways and superb
mountain views. Pymble and its neigh-
bor Avondale take some beating; after
rain they resemble one of the more diver-
sified English or Irish links. On the
whole, though, my vote goes to Dee Why.
It has everything, including a mountain
background, mighty gums mingled with
palms, lake views, a still, brimming
creek and emerald greens. If it was in
America there would be views of it in
all the tourist propaganda booklets.
* * * *
“Lond”: This golfing miracle hap-
pened on a military course in Assam.
At a 230-yard hole a tee shot, badly
sliced (1) hit a big tree, (2) cannoned off
and smashed through a pane of glass
into the clubhouse ballroom, (3) can-
noned off a door and on a billiard-table,
and (4) shot out through an open window
back on the course. The hole was done
in four ; and the whole freak business
is dated and signed and attested by the
regiment.
Car and Cycle
“Wooden Rim”: The record for an
hour’s continuous driving put up by
Eyston at Montlhery last month has been
broken by a German, Hans von Stuck.
Driving a specially-designed car, he
covered 135.7 miles, over two miles better
than Eyston. His racer is 13ft. long and
only 40in. high ; it carries a 16-cylinder
engine placed well back in the chassis.
The German Auto Union is backing it
in attempts on records.
* * * *
The finish of the dirt-track motor-
cycle-racing season on Sydney’s Speed-
way Royal happened late on a Saturday
night. Ten seconds after the last race
a mob of riders and mechanics sur-
rounded W. J. Goodwin, chief steward of
the Auto Cycle Union —the large, implac-
able gentleman whose black flag puts a
man out of a race, and whose red flag
puts everyone out. It looked like a lynch-
ing. Goodwin fought nobly, but the
assailants bore him down, and, while some
sat on his head, his arms and his legs,
others took his cherished flags and
burned them, singing “Auld Lang Syne”
around the pyre. They let Goodwin up
in time to join in the last verse, which he
did, but he had the last word: “The ele-
phant never forgets!”
Miscellaneous
Troops of young fellows play bowls
nowadays, but they can’t beat the old
chaps. Tom Williams, winner of the
singles championship of Australia at
Adelaide, is 64. He played nearly every
day for a fortnight in the most gruelling
March Adelaide has known and never
turned a hair. A member of South Park
club, he fought out the final against a
clubmate, E. R. Steer, on a green heavy
from rain and with a cross wind blow-
ing ; the stout old boy won easily. He
is the first South Australian to capture
the title.
* * * *
The University footballers have re-
turned from the North Pacific with glow-
ing opinions of Japanese sportsmanship
and pluck. Though 261 b. or 281 b. lighter
per man than the Australians, the
Japanese held their own in the scrums,
perfect condition and determination
making up for lack of weight. If they
can only induce their heavyweights to go
in for Rugby Union football instead of
wrestling, they will be most formidable
antagonists for the Springboks, Wallabies
and All Blacks. The tourists were hos-
pitably treated everywhere and brought
five trophies for Australian competitions,
besides presents for every member of the
team. They must have made an excel-
lent impression, but this is not to be
wondered at; as a rule, Australian foot-
ballers and cricketers who go on tour
are so modest and likeable that even the
Yellow Press cannot succeed in spoiling
them.
* * * *
Westralia has never had a representa-
tive in the Olympic Games, but if Percy
Oliver trains on he will be bidding hard
for a place in 1936. Fine as his form was
in the Australian championships at Bris-
bane, he improved on it when he returned
to Perth. In the inter-schools competi-
tions he swam 100 yards in 58 4-ssec.,
and 220 in 2min. 32 2-ssec., in each case
beating his opponents by a street. Craw-
ley water is anything but fast, and “to
break” 59 would be no mean achievement
on Noel Ryan’s part. And Oliver is not
yet 15.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
“THE BULLETIN” WOOL CARD.
The first serious attempt to classify our
wools was made by the Central Wool
Committee towards the end of the war.
That body named and appraised 848
types of wool.
Naturally, such a collection is too
unwieldy for everyday use. The pro-
blem of condensing this to retain the chief
types of wool grown in Australia and
find suitable means to display them
has been a knotty one, but The Bulle-
tin has begun to solve it. Its No. 1 Wool
Card is now available to purchasers.
This shows nine actual samples of
wools, Bradford standard, which range
from fine merino through comeback and
crossbred to Lincoln.
Each has been carefully chosen by
well-known woolbuyers as representative
of a particular type, and the final selec-
tion has been carefully examined and
commended by a leading wool expert.
An actual sample of each of the nine
types with full description and charac-
teristics has been mounted on a stout,
attractive folder which will stand on a
shelf for display, or may be hung on a
wall.
Type 1 is fine merino, 70’s spinners quality,
a sample that is grown to perfection in the
colder districts.
Type 2 is medium merino, 64’s quality. The
even crimp that is so fine in Type 1 as to be
almost imperceptible is plainly visible. This is
a deservedly popular wool and one that can be
grown almost anywhere in Australia.
Type 3, strong merino, 60’s quality, shows a
pronounced increase in the size of the crimp.
This crimp or wave in the fibre is the visual
factor by which the woolman estimates the spin-
ning quality of the wool. If the progress of
the crimp is followed from fine merino through
the samples to Lincoln it will be noticed that
as the wool becomes coarser the crimps become
larger </.<?., fewer waves per inch of fibre), and
the length of the wool fibre increases, while the
soft handle of the merino gives way to a definite
harshness.
Type 4 is doggy wool —coarse, harsh, stary
stuff like hair which buyers abhor.
Type 5, comeback, is a wool that ranges
between fine crossbred and medium merino and
frequently fetches a higher price per pound
than merino.
Type 6, fine crossbred or quarter-bred, 56’s
quality, shows the broadening crimp inherited
from the merino, with the pointed tip and
coarser fibre of the English wool.
Type 7 is medium crossbred or half-bred, 50’s
quality. The increase in length and other
longwool characteristics are further evident.
Type 8 is strong crossbred or threequarter-
bred, 46’s quality. In this longwool charac-
teristics predominate. The merino crimp has
given way to a broad wave, the fibre is long
and coarse and possesses a definite lustre.
Type 9 is Lincoln wool, 40’s quality, long,
coarse and lustrous, with pointed spiral tip.
A feature of the card is the table
denoting the wool resulting from the
mating of various types. It should be
recognised that wool samples subjected
to much handling are liable to become
dirty, and the essential characteristics
blurred and lost. It is advisable, there-
fore, that the card should be used as a
standard for reference only, and that it
should be supplemented by larger,
bulkier samples drawn from other fleeces
and matching exactly the quality of the
corresponding card type. By this prac-
tice, useful knowledge of the recognition
and “feel” of the various types will be
gained.
The price of The Bulletin Wool Card
is 35., or 3s. 6d. post free to any part of
Australia.
FAT-LAMB EXPERIMENTS.
“Golightly”: Until N.S.W. pasture im-
provement is further advanced, the bulk
of fat lambs sent to market will come
off herbage—essentially autumn and
winter grazing. Hence the Cowra Farm
experiments, which recently summarised
the comparative results of three Downs
breeds of rams, are not of much value.
The first consignment of 12 lambs of
each cross was marketed on October 2,
which is far too late for herbage country,
where grass-seed plays havoc with un-
shorn lambs. It is up to the department
to give us something to follow from its
tabulated results of March-April lambs.
The good work done by Cowra puts
it beyond doubt that first-cross ewes pro-
duce the most profitable export lambs —
provided they can be held on suitable
pastures until October-November. I
hold that to attempt to drop March-
April lambs from first-cross ewes would
land most fat-lamb raisers in the
Bankruptcy Court owing to the ewes re-
fusing to mate in sufficient numbers.
Cowra Farm confirms the extreme early
maturity of Dorset Horn crossbred
lambs and the higher standard of export
lambs produced by crossbred and come-
back ewes in comparison with merino
ewes. Also that for mating with the
latter the Dorset ram is the only suitable
Downs breed.
While climate, natural pasture and
merino ewes dominate lamb-raising in
this State, I suggest that conclusive trials
be based on March-April drop lambs.
WOOL-CLASSING COSTS.
“Murrawong”: Herewith a few figures
for sheepowners who “won’t pay a wool-
classer.” They are the genuine costs of
classing a run of sheds representing west-
ern N.S.W., the Riverina, S.-W. Slopes
and New England, based on present rates
in a bad season, with an average loss of
one day per week on account of wet
weather. Costs include, besides the stand-
ard rate (at per 1000 or weekly), board
and lodging, taxes, travelling and other
expenses.
Classing
• cost
Sheep, per sheep.
A station, western N.S.W. 40,000 .43d.
B station, western N.S.W. 12,000 .48d.
C station, Riverina .. 12,000 .41d.
D station, S.-W. Slopes .. 10.000 .6d.
E station, N. England .. 14,000 .47d.
Shearers employed ranged from six to
12. The only case to exceed id. per sheep
was accounted for by a more than aver-
age bout of wet weather.
In one of these station totals are
the sheep of two neighbors, both under
the 1000 mark. Previously they had
always shorn at home with a portable
plant, the job lasting about a week, with
no attempt made to class the wool. This
time, each man’s flock was handled in
a day, his bales being well pressed, his
fleece properly got up for market and
pieces well picked.
The ownefs were saved the entire worry
that goes with shearing, and total shear-
ing costs were just a shade over half of
what it cost them to do it at home.
With a two- or three-stand plant the
classer carries out additional duties —
“experting,” piece-picking or wool-rolling
—thus saving the wages and keep of one
shed-hand. For three shearers doing 1600
sheep per week, the classer-woolroller
costs 1.16 d. per sheep. On the same basis
a shed-hand costs .67d. per sheep ; there-
fore the net classing cost is .49d. per
sheep. The value of a classed clip over
an unclassed one cannot be definitely
expressed in figures, but try to imagine
the position if every clip arrived on the
market “all in” or badly skirted and with
pieces badly picked.
A cost of Id. per sheep cutting 101 b.
of wool means l-20d. per lb. to the
owner for having his wool properly pre-
pared and his shed-hands competently
instructed and managed.
DRENCHING FOR WORMS.
“Jumbuck”: I don’t agree with
“Leo Lear” (B. 21/2/’34) that an
arsenical drench is too dangerous to
give sheep. The best results I ever
obtained in bad wormy country came
from the use of the mixture that “Leo
Lear” condemns. Bluestone might be
all right for worms in the intestines, but
it won’t shift Strongylus filaria and
Strongylus rufescens, which prevail in the
air passages and lungs respectively.
No specific has been invented that will
cope with the various worm complaints,
footrot and fluke, as “Leo Lear” contends
bluestone will. Each ailment needs its
own distinct treatment. For lung or
passage worms there’s little or no danger
in using a mixture made up of water
sgal., arsenic 20z., Epsom salts 81b. and
washing soda 2oz. Boil the arsenic and
soda until thoroughly dissolved, add the
Epsom salts, and, after trying the mix-
ture when cold on a few lambs, starve
the mob for at least 12 hours, and dose.
Give lambs loz. and grown sheep 2oz.
And keep the mob in the yard for six to
eight hours after treatment. There’ll be
no deaths from poisoning if the correct
strength and dose are given.
TRACKING THE BLOWFLY.
“G.H.H.”: Only a minute fraction of
flies bred in a carcass could attack sheep,
and “Lion” (B. 28/2/’34) overlooks
migration. The coastal region from Bris-
bane to Adelaide, chiefly in forest areas,
is a perpetual breeding-ground for some
primary blowflies.
These flies occur only seasonally in-
land, being exterminated there over the
summer months. Some of the perman-
ent residents of the south supply winter
visitors to Queensland, where, again, they
are annually eliminated. Like migratory
butterflies and locusts, such flies are cap-
able of travelling hundreds of miles, but
are faster than the large insects and
hardly noticeable on the wing. This is
true beyond doubt about genus Calli-
phora, but Lucilia is harder to track,-
although known to roam widely.
Why destroy carcass-breeding flies
when this greater menace is unchecked?
Traps catch relatively few migrants, bat-
talion after battalion of which sweep the
station. Carcass destruction kills rela-
tively few visiting flies and probably none
of the local ones.
Secondary blowflies are excluded from
these remarks and very much in evidence
in carcasses and traps. They are un-
worthy of consideration, as control aims
at upsetting the relationship between
primary flies, bacteria and fleece. With-
,out bacterial action, sheep are immune
to blowflies, and their faeces are found
to give no nutriment to young maggots,
which shows that scouring could prove
harmless only indirectly. Carcass de-
struction and traps are futile measures.
They punish the alleged culprit without
trial, but leave the master criminal free.
“Egad”: I agree with “Lion” (B.
28/2/’34) that carcass destruction does
some good in removing possible breed-
ing-places, but it .is; only one of many
helps. The best way is to keep the flock
healthy and free from worms, for it is
recognised that sheep in good health will
resist the fly much better than when
weak and unhealthy. They are, as well,
less inclined to be struck, as there is
less scouring.
This year at Roma (Q.) we have had
practically no fly, while neighbors have
been complaining for months past how
severe it is. The sole reason is that our
sheep have been drenched regularly.
Don’t wait for the worms to show.
Nowadays there are very few districts
without worms or fluke, and very few
sheep which aren’t affected. Drench at
least every two or three months whether
you think the sheep need it or not.
THE ONE-MAN GRINDSTONE.
“Terence”: To rig up the grindstone so
that tools may be ground by one man:
Drive an axle through the lead centre of
the stone until it protrudes 3in. on one
side and 7in. on the other. Obtain two
pieces of 6in. x 6in. timber about sft.
long. About a foot from the ends, bore
holes which should be a neat fit for the
axle. Go right through one and for
about 3in. into the other exactly oppo-
site. Insert the stone with a couple of
washers on each side of it. Put two
blocks slightly thicker than the stone
between and at the ends of the 6in. x 6in.
and nail or bolt together.
To this fasten four legs about 3ft.
long, with enough spread to keep the
trestle firm. If there is an old bicycle
crank with pedal-axle attached this will
serve admirably, provided it is shorter
than the stone is from centre to top.
Fit the crank to axle, which has had
one flat face filed for crank pin. Bore a
hole at the end of a 2ft. length of 2in. x
2in. big enough to take the pedal-axle,
off which can be hacksawn a portion to
leave about 2|in.
Attach the 2in. x 2in., put on a washer
and burr up. Saw a slot about 2}in.
wide by 3in. long in the end of a 4ft.
length of 2in. x 4in. Insert end of 2in. x
2in. Bore a hole right through all and
keep in place with a bolt. Bore the other
end of 2in. x 4in. across the 4in. way
and fasten on the outside and near the
bottom of the hind leg. To manipulate,
start stone revolving by hand, when foot
will do the rest with very little effort.
DROUGHT INSURANCE.
“Sheepo”: The whole of pastoral
Queensland resembles a wheatfield.
Conditions, according to the prophets,
promise early further rains. There’ll
soon be plenty of feed going to waste.
Scores of graziers say “I must get a
few stacks of bush hay cut” ; but you
don’t hear of 1 per cent, that carry out
their resolution. The wails are heard
later, when drought conditions prevail
and working horses and stud stock have
to be artificially fed and flocks and herds
sent out on agistment.
One station manager, who practises
what he preaches, has for years past put
by fodder supplies from excess native
grasses. He has repeatedly stated that in
a season like the present enough fodder
could be stacked or siloed by every sheep
grazier to keep his sheep alive for at least
six months after the pinch comes.
It seems plain cussedness that the lead
he has given is not followed even by his
neighbors, who have during the past two
decades seen for themselves the bene-
ficial results of his foresight.
Some of our native grasses are splen-
did for ensilage, but each successive
drought, in Queensland especially, re-
peats the story of its predecessor. In
most cases finance is said to be the
stumbling-block to fodder conservation,
yet whence comes the money to pay for
agistment and droving when stock have
to be shifted?
Individually, the graziers will not act
and provide permanent drought insur-
ance, but financial institutions could in-
sist on excess feed supplies being stored
away for the uncertain future.
The Queensland Government will
advance money for ringbarking. All the
ringbarking in the world, however, will
not allow feed to grow in drought
periods. Far better if wise State financing
could allow graziers to store their excess
grasses. One ton of feed held for times
of need would be worth more than 1000
acres of ringbarked country.

HINTS FOR THE FARM
“M.SJ.”: Look for holes made by
rabbits or stock in the meshes of wire-
netting fences at night. A light shines
white on the meshes, and any hole, small
or large, is much more easily seen than
by daylight. Put a trap at the holes
for a few nights, and you will probably
catch the party (mostly a buck, if a
bunny). If you don’t catch him he will
soon make another hole or take to jump-
ing over the top, in which case you may
never get him, but will be troubled by
others who follow him over.
“Ah Doo”: When cutting a cabbage
put cross (+ ) cuts in the stem and leave
in the ground. Within a month at least
four small cabbages will sprout off this
old root.
“D.A.G.”: Take a neat blaze out of
your corner strainer-posts before mor-
tising the stay —that allows the stay to
seat in the heart wood and makes the job
look better. The blaze must be deep
enough to be reasonably close to heart
wood.
“Tug”: To raise a “down” cow when
better gear is unavailable: Take the farm
dray—with food and water if necessary.
Lower the shafts so that the cow lies
between them. Pass the bellyband under
her and she will be an easy lift with
one man on each shaft. When the props
are let down, tie rope from tug to tug
in front, and thei same with the breech-
ing astern. Chock the wheels and you
have a portable sling.
“M.S.”: For a meat safe or coolhouse,
put four light poles in the ground, and
cover on three sides and on top with
iron. Foufth side must be fitted with a
flyproof door. Build shelves as required,
bottom one six inches from the ground.
Around this safe build another as a
jacket, allowing six inches space all
round. Freely punch holes in the iron
of this jacket; no top is required. Now
fill up space between with fairly coarse
and fine charcoal mixed ; see that the top
of original safe has a good six inches
over it. Fill up underneath the bottom
shelf similarly. The door is made in
exactly the same way—inside sheet of
iron plain, outside perforated. A four-
inch space filled with charcoal is suffi-
cient for the door. Now pour water on
top of charcoal all round until well
soused. The slow evaporation keeps the
inside safe beautifully cool.
“Wayback”: I have proved sprouted
oats a good egg-producer. Cover a pail
of the grain with water and let it stand
seven hours in warm weather —longer in
cold. Then turn into a larger vessel with
a hole in it for drainage. Keep warm
for three or four days. When well
sprouted spread about four inches deep
in a box with holes in it and stir daily.
When the sprouts are iin. to lin. long
give the fowls all they will eat twice a
day. One bushel makes five bushels of
processed oats.
“FJ.”: To prevent gates that are hung
with hook-and-eye hinges from being
lifted off by cattle or pigs, put a thread
on the end of the hook that goes through
the eye and screw on a good nut, with a
wide washer between it and the eye of
the hinge.
HINTS FOR HINTERS.
In addition to space rates, £1 Is. will be paid
for the best hint of the week.
Don’t send a covering letter.
Write your name, pen-name and address on
the top of the first page. Then fire away,
writing on every second line. Don t waste
words or trouble to begin: “This is a hint
which I have used for 20 years.” Remem-
ber that 100 words is about the limit of length.
The competition will close on March 31.
“M.P.”: A bridle-breaking horse can
be cured with a special halter made of
discarded inner motor tubes. Split two
tubes and roll them tightly together ; then
bind them with a stout cord or wire.
Place a snap-hook on each end. When
the horse pulls back on the tubes they
keep on yielding. When the animal tires
the halter tightens and draws the rebel
back into place.
“Artesian”: A quickly made and effec-
tive splint for a broken sheep’s leg: Cut
a gum or box sucker about 2m. in
diameter and strip 6in. or 7in. of the
bark m one piece. Open down one side
only. Fit this bark around the broken
shank and bind on tightly. By the time
the binding has rotted the break will
have mended and the bark fallen oft.
“Outback”: To convert a patch of
cold, wet soil too sour for cropping, sow
horse or tick beans. Plough in each
second furrow when green, and let the
rest seed. Beans are one of the most con-
centrated feeds for the neddy. The dried
vines can be ploughed in, too. As green
manure, the beans will turn waste land
into good cropping fields.
“Leo Lear”: Here is a way of fixing
barb-wire on a fence which eliminates
much handling: Bore all posts with an
inch auger and run a plain wire through
the holes. Tie one end of the plain wire
to the coil of barb-wire placed on a
“jenny.” Couple Dobbin on to the other
end and move him off. The horse will
pull the whole length of barb-wire
through the bored posts as required.
Place a temporary stay against the post
next to the coil, or the shock of the
barb pulling through will loosen it.
“5.8.”: To deal with worms in horses,
don’t give the neddy a feed overnight.
In the morning make a mash and mix
in a good handful of sawdust. In about an
hour’s time you can give the usual feed
and work the patient.
“Regal”: Melt your old gramophone
records down. Mixed with turpentine
they make a good floor stain.
“Spud Bar”: Round posts may be
made to bark themselves. Make it a
condition of the boring that the contrac-
tor runs a sliver of bark down each post
on opposite sides, where the holes enter
and emerge. He may object at first, but
soon finds that it expedites the boring. In
a month the bark will be hanging loose,
and, having no wires through it to up-
hold it, it will flap free and fall to the
ground, and the job will not have cost
a penny extra.
“Marsh”: If you’re short of tinkers
solder sulphur will serve at a pinch. Put
equal amounts of sulphur and fine sand
in a tin and place on a fire until the
Sulphur has melted; then pour over the
hole. When cold it’ll need a chisel to
remove the mixture.
“Albarmount”: To make a tool for
filling in dug-out burrows, cut a heavy
forked log—as for a slide—square the
inner sides and bolt two sides of an old
square iron tank into the V of the fork.
Attach a horse to each prong and work
one on each side of the trench, so that
the contrivance will scoop the dirt from
both sides into the centre, thus working
in reverse effect to a delver.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
{Transferred from Service Department.)
Treatment for bumblefoot in poultry ? —526.
Bumblefoot is caused by a pus-forming
organism entering the foot, usually by an
abrasion. Little can be done to prevent it.
Paint the foot daily with iodine for at least
a week, and then lance to remove the pus
Often in the early stages painting only will
effect a cure.
How to eradicate blackberry from a paddock ?
When blackberry is well established it is
difficult to bring under control owing to the
fact that the roots sucker freely. The plants
should be destroyed as soon as they appear.
The work of “brushing” this thrnny plant is
unpleasant, so spray the plants with a suitable
poison and burn them when dead. Furtner
sprayings will then destroy young plants, or
these can be hoed out. The spraying must be
thorough, and where the growth is dense and
extensive it will be necessary to cut a track
through it first. The N.S.W. Department of
Agriculture has learnt through a three-year test
that sodium chlorate —1-Vlb. to lgal. of water is
the most effective poison. The best time to
spray is in early summer, when the vines are
making active growth and show many leaves.
The foliage then absorbs the solution easily
and the plant dies rapidly. Dense blackberry
sprayed on December 15 at the rate of 160
gallons an acre was practically wiped out, but
odd shoots showed up later. A further spray-
ing on February 13 cleared the whole area.
Sheep will keep the young plants down.
Kikuyu grass sown after burning helps to
smother the suckers.
(1) Would lime in the humus pit be harmful
or would it help to decay the contents ? (2)
The best method of killing lice on citrus trees ?
—395.
Lime is not harmful but essential to produce
fertiliser from refuse. Ground limestone or
carbonate of lime is a convenient form to use.
Add 41b. or 51b. to each 1001 b. of refuse.
Slaked lime may also be used —31b. to 41b. per
1001 b. of refuse. In each case fork the lime
into the refuse. (2) Fumigation or spraying
with lime sulphur will rid citrus trees of white
louse. Lime sulphur should be used at a dilu-
tion of one to nine of water and applied during
spring to get the best results.
THIS WEEK’S PRIZE HINT.
The guinea has been won by
M. PRIOR, Thornleigh, N.S.W.
A discarded 10- or 1 5-gallon milk-
can makes an ideal holder for grain
bags. Punch a half-inch hole in the
side of the can near the bottom
(which has been removed), and three
smaller holes in the neck, spaced
equally round it. Into the latter
holes clinch hooks, points outside
the can. The can is hung upside
down on a spike on a wall, or on
a post, and the grain bag is fastened
on the neck with the thin hooks.
Title bag is easily filled. If the
holder is to be used with different
lengths of bags, it may be hung
up by a rope or chain, so as to be
quickly adjustable for height.

Now It’s Coal
Depression? There’s no depression in
coal! Or there won’t be when Coal Oil
Australia, Ltd., gets going. “The problem
of coal distillation has been definitely
solved. Plants in Great Britain and Ger-
many are already in successful and profit-
able operation.” So Coal Oil Australia
is to acquire 10,000 acres of freehold
coal property near Wyong (N.S.W.) at
£5 an acre. “Present value of coal area,
£3O per acre, £300,000.” One of the
objects of the co. is to sell this property
“at its real economic value while retain-
ing a royalty on the output of coal.”
The public is offered 49,000 ord.
shares ; those who buy are to be mem-
bers of “a vending syndicate investment
such as rarely offers.” The land is to be
sold to debenture-holders, presumably at
£3O an acre ; £1,500,000 of this deben-
ture money is asked for, to be raised
under the most attractive and sound condi-
tions as to security, etc. The co. will, as
managers and agents for the debenture-
holders, receive in perpetuity 10 p.c. of the
net profits of the whole enterprise and, in
addition, a royalty of lOd. per ton on all
coal at pithead.
The promoters apparently won’t be
satisfied unless they make £300,000 for
shareholders within five years by selling
the land to the “attractively secured”
debenture-holders. As managers they
hope to rake in £50,000 p.a. for the co.
and another £20,800 from royalties. All
that on a capital of £50,000.
The debenture-holders are to finance
the outlay on colliery and distillation
plant, and are to receive interest at 6
p.c. for “five years or less,” after which
the debentures are to be “redeemed” by
conversion into shares of a co. to be
formed to do the job the debenture-
holders set out to do in the first instance.
The cost of coal at pithead is put down
at 10s. a ton —the average value in N. S.
Wales last year was estimated at 12s. 2d.
Cost of distillation is set down at 2s.
6d., and the whole charge for treat-
ment comes to only 15s. The products
are to be sold for £2 55., leaving “a gross
profit” (in black type) of £1 10s. a ton.
Profits of £600,000 p.a. from coal-mining
and -distillation is the modest estimate of
the prospectus.
According to this remarkable document,
one of the advantages of the scheme is
that the co. will have its own wharves in
“the Tuggerqh Lake, with its six to seven
fathoms of water.” Another advantage,
not mentioned, is that the directors will be
able to wade out into the channel at the
Entrance and indulge in a little snapper-
fishing when the tide is high enough. They
might even entertain some of the “attrac-
tively secured” debenture-holders in this
way before they are “redeemed.”
Those who haven’t any ready cash to
buy the shares can trade in their Gov-
ernment bonds or “any other negotiable
securities.” All cheques must be made
payable to Joint Stock Securities Pty.,
Ltd., Australia House, Carrington-street,
Sydney. This concern has issued a cir-
cular containing the alluring assurance
that “every £lOO paid for shares over the
next 12 months gives a minimum return
of £6OO, spread over three years, includ-
ing the period of payment for shares.”
It has “underwritten” the share issue, and
has “undertaken to dispose of the deben-
tures issued.”
Out of a total expenditure on loan
works amounting to £784,000,000 up to
June, 1933, the Australian States had
sunk 350 millions in railways, 119 mil-
lions in water-supply and irrigation
schemes, 81 millions in harbor improve-
ments, roads and bridges, 103 millions in
land-settlement schemes, and 131 millions
in public buildings and other trifles.
Revenue deficits, etc., bring the total
debts of the States up to £807,000,000.

Cerutty, the Federal Auditor-General,
had a few words to say about the Newnes
(N.S.W.) shale-oil deposits in his just-
issued report. Over £1,800,000 was spent
on the scheme when it was in private
hands ; and the Commonwealth has since
put more money into it. “It appears hope-
less to expect,” says Mr. Cerutty, “that
extraction of oil from shale, with its
heavy hewing and other labor costs on
comparatively narrow seams of shale, can
become a payable proposition in compe-
tition with oil wells.” Mining costs have
always been the bugbear at Newnes.
Still, the present l\d. a gallon tax on im-
ported petrol should help to offset these.

“King D.”: During the first quarter of
1933 the percentage of unemployed in
“Boss in?”
“Just gone out to lunch.” ,
“Will he be in after lunch?”
“Don’t think so —it was lunch he went out after.”
the building trade throughout Australia
was 38.7 p.c.; the year finished with 32.2
p.c. Woodworkers out of jobs at Dec.
31 represented about 32.9 p.c. of those
registered, an improvement of 3.3 p.c.
during the year. Engineering and quarry-
ing have been the next most precarious
occupations during the slump. My off-
spring are going to be apprenticed in the
printing, clothing or food-manufacturing
trades. They have shown the steadiest
employment figures over the past four
years.
“Noya”: Let “Wilfremon” be soothed
(B. 7/3/’34) ; the Speck also has its jazz
system for calculating freight-rates. The
charge on a case of fruit sent from Laun-
ceston to Longford—about 14 miles —
was Is. To return the box empty would
have cost Is. 6d., so, on the advice of
a friendly railway official, I filled it with
old rags, labelled it “miscellaneous mer-
chandise” and sent it back for 6d.

Premier Butler, of S.A., has come to
the conclusion that the wheat-farmer is
now worse off than he was a year ago.
Around June, 1932, Wainwright, now
Auditor-General, was finding out har-
rowing things about the plight of growers
on the Murray lands and Eyre Peninsula.
Roughly a fifth of the assisted farmers
paid their way in 1931-32, but Wain-
wright reckoned that many others would
be unable to carry on even if wheat rose
to 4s. or ss. a bushel. Butler is
facing the matter squarely. Farmers
are suffering from an accumulation of
interest, he says ; and his Government
is prepared to write off capital that is
gone. The State will be a heavy loser
in any case. In Butler’s opinion, it is
better to give a farmer who is playing
the game the benefit of the writing-off
than to let some speculator pick the
property up for a song.
* * * *
“Kariah”: After placing excellent lines
of processed oysters and butter-fish on
the market, Port Stephens Canneries are
turning their attention to prawns. The
Myall River teems with first-class prawns.
Recently 1120 cases were dispatched to
market in eight days.
* * * *
“Bringelly”: It’s not often that Aus-
tralian manufacturers invade the English
market, but tennis-racquet makers in the
Old Country are agitating for a duty on
Australian frames. Jack Crawford and
his band popularised a particular style of
Australian-made racquet, and English
makers are perturbed about the sale of
these in their country.
* * * *
“Smiler”: If savings-bank deposit
figures are any guide, old Depresh is los-
ing his grip. In June, 1929, the average
Australian had a nest-egg of £35 7s. 7d.
In March, 1932, it had got down to £29
1 Is. lid. From that point there has been
a fairly steady increase, and at December
31 last the average deposit was £3O 12s.
sd. South Australians are the thriftiest
with £39 4s. sd. a head, followed by Vic-
torians (£37 4s. 10d.), and Cornstalks
(£27 16s. 3d.).
* * * *
“Te Bab.”: Having a few quid in
English money, I offered it to a
trading bank. Was it a big sum?
It was not —and the teller said the
bank bought only if the sum was
large. But several alert lads present
eagerly offered to buy. I preferred to
take it to the Commonwealth Bank. It
would pay only 21s, for an English
pound. I finally sold to a travel agency
for a little less than the 255. per £ banks
say is its value in Australia.

In its last 28-day period the B.H.
Pty. turned out 29,354 tons of pig-iron,
as against 27,373 tons in January and
20,010 tons during the same period of
1933. Steel ingots, rods, rails and cast-
ings showed corresponding increases.
* * * *
Australian aviation is not showing
much progress. Excluding New Guinea,
there were 177 civil ’planes registered
at September 30 last, as against 190 in
1932 and 228 in 1930. A great falling-
off in passengers is shown, but freights
have jumped up considerably, mainly
owing to goldfields developments.
* * * *
“A.A.”: -“G.A.L.” (B. 14/3/’34) is
right in his general condemnation of the
sales-tax system, but it is plain to see
why some of the things he mentions,
such as vaseline, sulphur and lanoline,
are taxable. These three things are the
basis of scores of patent medicines, and
if the tax is paid on the ingredients it
is not right that the made-up mixture
should be taxed again. This is really why
these patent mysteries are free of tax.
As for iodine —well, it seems that this
particular item is taxable on occasions
and free on others. I was told that
wholesalers were not sure whether it was
taxable or not. So as long as every
second invoice for iodine is free, I feel
satisfied. 5

The Japanese continue to buy much
more from us than we buy from them ;
the excess for the six months to Dec.

represent 60 p.c. of our imports from
Japan.

Insurance cos. have paid out many
thousands of pounds in workers’ com-
pensation to axemen—chiefly foreigners
—who have lost portions of fingers on
the left hand ; but magistrates are get-
ting suspicious. L South Westralia re-
cently a hardy toiler claimed £l5O for
the loss of two joints of the first finger,
explaining that he had been cutting a
wedge for a broad axe when it “slipped
on a sappy log.” The R.M. sniffed and
said it did not look genuine to him.
Claim dismissed, with costs.

The S. Aus. Government is scratching
its head as to what it must do with the
wheat bounty in the case of share-
farmers. The Commonwealth Act said
bounty was “payable to any person who
has sown wheat during the year 1933.”
Any share-farming agreement is liable to
differ from any other; and payment to
the person who actually sowed may be
most unjust in some cases. But injus-
tice to individuals is a natural result of
hasty expedients and slipshod legislation.
* * * *
“Te Babarantiko”: Just attended the
opening of a consignment of Japanese
barber chairs. They looked queer—low,
as if for children, and ill-finished. Under-
neath the enamel was broken and blis-
tered, leaving the iron patchily bare.
Exterior parts were unevenly white-
enamelled. Assembling was difficult
owing to indifferent fit of the interlock-
ing parts. But the dwarf-like contrap-
tions came in well-finished packing-cases.

Henry Prior, editor of “The Bulletin” for 18 years, his son, H. K. Prior,
has provided £lOO per annum for a prize, to be known as the S. H. Prior
Memorial Prize, which will be awarded every year for a work of fiction.
Entries for the first competition will close on June 6, 1935, and results
will be announced within two months thereafter.
The trustees, who will supply all relevant information to intending
competitors on application, will publish the successful work together with
any others which they may deem worthy. The winning novel will be published
within two months after the announcement of the results.
Royalties at the usual rates will be paid on sales of works so published,
in which the entrants will retain all property rights, except world book rights,
which will be controlled by the trustees.

The Other Fellow’s Mind.
The Old-age Pension
If funds were available, I would send
a copy of the “Queensland Pioneer
Book” to every Canberra politician who
tinkered with old-age pensions. The
clause designed to compel an unwilling
child to contribute degrades the independ-
ence of old folk. In North Queensland
alone there are dwindling hundreds of
pioneers who, while not achieving wealth
of their own, helped to make it for
others. Vacillation is the outstanding fea-
ture of recent old-age pensions legisla-
tion. If a cut was necessary why didn’t
the politicians make it, and have done with
it? Instead, they went in for all sorts
of inquisitorial provisions, and have had
to “amend” their precious legislation
again and again.—J. W. (N.Q.).
Unifying the Gauges
Unification of railway gauges is before
the public again, and, as usual, all the
talk is of making 4ft. 8-|in. the standard;
but what sense would there be in spending
millions on altering the 3ft. 6in. gauges
of 4000 miles in Westralia, 6400 in
Queensland and 2000 in South Aus. to the
4ft. South Africa has no trouble
with the 3ft. 6in. gauge; neither has
Maoriland. The Cape Town-Johannes-
burg express averages 33.86 m.p.h. on the
3ft. 6in. with a rise of 6000 ft.; the Kal-
goorlie-Port Augusta takes 39f hours to
do 1051 miles on easy grades, averaging
26.44 m.p.h. I suggest a third rail on the
3ft. 6in. between Kalgoorlie and Port
Augusta. This would mean only one
break of gauge between Fremantle and
Sydney, via Broken Hill. —J. W. (N.Q.).
Same Old Tomfoolery
The latest scheme of the N.S.W. Gov-
ernment for dragging prosperity around
the corner into Easy-street is only a resur-
rection of a stunt of ancient vintage. The
most obvious of all facts in connection
with these schemes is that not one home
can be built unless it has a bit of land
under it. More than that, houses can
only be built from materials obtainable
from nowhere else but land. Conse-
quently, the easier it is to borrow the
greater demand there will be for land.
The more demand there is for land the
dearer land will become ; and the dearer
the land the dearer the home will be. The
whole tendency will be for the “cheap”
money to push values up against bor-
rowers so that what they may pick up
on the swings they will lose on the
roundabouts.
Real-estate people, of course, are giving
the scheme their benedictions. Suppose
10,000 people avail themselves of the
“easy” terms and acquire blocks worth
only £lOO each, even for such cheap
blocks it will mean a cool million to
vendors, with some choice titbits for
agents, lawyers, and so on. Naturally the
“vacant-lot” industry will look up, and
with the increasing demand there will be
increasing revenue to landowners for per-
mitting people to build homes with the
cheap borrowed money.
As a nation we seem merely to rotate.
And, notwithstanding the experiences of
the past, we appear to be in for a repeti-
tion of the same old socialistic foolery
which landed us in our present mess. —
S. V. L. (N.S.W.).
The Leisure State
“Pawang” (B. 28/2/’34) was wise in
leaving his speculations on the Leisure
State on a very uncertain note ; but there
is one thing of which we can be pretty-
sure —history will repeat itself. When
Kant, Hume and the rest inaugurated the
Age of Reason it was believed that if
only men could be made rational Utopia
would be achieved. The machinery was
to be compulsory education, and the
rationalists fought the conservatives
tooth and nail and won. Nobody in
the Age of Reason foresaw the radio
debauching the public’s ear, the pic-
torial press deteriorating its eye and
mind, and the movies perverting its moral
sense.
If anybody wants to see what the
Leisure State will be like he has only
to go and look at one in being—an abori-
ginal settlement.— Lord Luvus (Vic.).


NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
The C.W.A. in the North
“Vic”: If anyone becomes debilitated
by the North Queensland climate, it
obviously isn’t the womenfolk. The pro-
gress report of the northern wing of
the Country Women’s Association fills
134 quarto pages, and, judging by the
advertisements in it, it didn’t cost the
association much. The northern C.W.A.
is active over 309,000 square miles. Its
influence starts across the Territory
border at the Rankine and extends to
south of Mackay. It has 69 branches
and 19 younger sets. Some of its
branches have a couple of hundred mem-
bers. It has huts and clubhouses and
rest-rooms, and its seaside homes for the
use of inlanders are a popular part of its
assets.
The northernmost of them is on
Prince of Wales Island, which is a neigh-
bor of Thursday Island. In Herberton,
the C.W.A. inaugurated a swimming-pool,
and in every town there is an active
record of work among children, of funds
raised for the aged and of bountiful gifts
for the hospitals. During the typhoid
epidemic at Cloncurry, the local C.W.As.
mobilised and worked in eight-hour shifts
helping the hospital authorities and col-
lecting necessaries, and Mackinlay and
Julia Creek, remote from doctors, owe
the presence of a nurse installed in a
nursing home to the association. Millaa
Millaa, on the Atherton, runs the local
cottage hospital from its own resources.
Twenty-four rest-rooms have been
built. Many of these have a children’s
attendant and a clinic, with a bedroom,
bathroom and kitchenette for the use of
any bush mother en route to hospital;
or to add a new Queenslander to the
population, and the halls which have
been put up in several towns
are great social centres. At
present, an effort is in pro-
gress to build a Northern
Women’s Pioneer Memorial
Hall at Townsville, to which
the proceeds of Mrs. Adam
Black’s encyclopaedia of
pioneers will go.
What the C.W.A. has
done has been done effi-
ciently, and permanency of
administration has been
maintained. The first hon-
orary secretary, Mrs. A. J.
Crowther, became president
in 1926, and has held the
office since. Mrs. Black,
Mrs. McManus and Mrs.
Hopkins are council dele-
gates, and the divisional
secretary is Miss Nell
Hamilton, of Townsville.
Since the foundation year, 1923, the
membership has almost doubled, and —
State Treasurers, please note! —the asso-
ciation has spent only £40,000 out of a
revenue of £60,000. In no year has it
had a debit balance.
“Mossman”: Deaths in the N.Q.
cyclone have risen to 76, many of the
victims being Asiatics and natives, but
even that is far from being a record.
The Cape York coast is used to these
blows —there are usually a couple each
year. The worst was that at Cape Mel-
ville in ’99, when dozens of luggers and
300 souls were lost, but even this could
not match the Matty cyclone in the
ironically named “Peaceful Ocean”
beyond the Bismarcks, which wiped out
half the population of the most interest-
ing island in the equatorial Pacific. The
last bad hurricane on the east coast was
in 1923, when the Douglas Mawson was
lost —I was through that one. Palm-tree
trunks were twisted off like matches and
many a Torres island was flooded, but
the loss of life and vessels would have
been much heavier if the approach of
the big blow had not been heralded by
a week of bad weather. Next to the ’99
affair the most disastrous in lives was that
in which the s.s. Yongala disappeared
with all hands on March 23, 1911 ; but
that which struck Mackay in 1918,
though only 30 persons were killed, did
more damage to property, the loss being
estimated at £1,000,000. W.A.’s northern
coast has had more than its share of
cyclones—there were 62 between 1872 and
19M. The most memorable were the two
Lagrange Bay in April, ’OB, and Broome
m November the same year, in each of
which 50 persons perished. •
“Fi. Fa.”: I had only the personal state-
ments of Leonard Wood as to the under-
lying reason for his selection as Gov-
ernor of the Philippines. But I have to
admit that “Gain” (B. 7/3/’34) is right in
what he says about the damage done to
the Kanakas by interference with their
local customs. It has been the gist of
my whole argument, this one fact that
the most successful Administrator will be
the man who best understands how to
replace their old ways of living by their
equivalent or better.
* * * *
“Pandanus”: “Murrungurry” is wrong
(B. 14/3/’34). Lakes Barrine and Eacham
(N.Q.) are not devoid of life. Wild-
fowl are plentiful on both lakes, especi-
ally on Eacham, on which there are no
speedboats. Small fish are numerous.
Introduced trout breed, but the progeny
grow only a few inches long. Platypus
are common along the banks and the
waters hold a unique eel. Neither lake
is bottomless; Barrine is between 300
and 400 feet deep.
* * * *
“S. D’Oyst”: Innisfail (N.Q.) seems
near to repeating the Kalgoorlie per-
formance, but with Italians on both sides.
Till a few years ago, the Italians in the
North, mostly Tuscans and such Goth-
descended, law-abiding folk, prided them-
“What’s all this?”
"I teach te cow to give me ten-bob note when I tell him admission silver coin!”
selves on the absence of the Sicilian-
Neapolitan element whose Black Hand
and Camorristic activities were so ruth-
lessly suppressed by Mussolini. Some of
the survivors from his effective opera-
tions bolted to Australia. The inade-
quate local police force is handicapped by
ignorance of Italian. Meanwhile, the
law-abiding majority of Italians is re-
strained from lynching a few rascals only
by the efforts of the Consul-General. If
he is successful in getting some of the
troublemakers sent home, II Duce may
be relied upon to deal with them. If
not, some lively doings may be expected.
* * * *
“Vic”: The long bow is still a popu-
lar weapon. This from Archer Russell’s
recently published “Tramp Royal in Aus-
tralia” :
“It can’t be very high... .119 deg. yester-
day, you know.” He walked over to the
small thermometer that was hanging in the
shade on the wall. “Ah, I thought so
why, it’s only 105 deg I knew we were
in for a cool change.”
This happened on the S.A. border, south
of the Finke. As Marble Bar, the heat-
record holder, which is a good long way
from that region, has never recorded a
temperature higher than 120.5 deg.—once.—once
in 1905 and once in 1922 —the Southern
Territory must have been doing extra
well during Mr. Russell’s visit. Any-
way, 105 deg. doesn’t make even a Terri-
torian talk about “cool changes.” It
belongs to special bursts of heat. But
Australia can’t compete with Asia in
temperatures. Let anybody who doubts
it try the Lut or Western Baluchistan in
'June.
“Kynuna”: Qantas is doing more than
is asked of it in producing machines for
the Australian-Singapore run. Its new
Commonwealth class biplane is a com-
paratively light job besides such machines
as the Astraea. She is a four-engined
De Havilland 86, successor to the twin-
engined Dragon, which is used by the
Prince of Wales and on the Melbourne-
Tasmanian route. Her cruising speed
is 145 m.p.h.—far in excess of the tender
requirement. Her four engines will give
her reliability for the Timor flight; she
has an unusually high rate of climb to
meet boggy aerodrome conditions and
to give her a quick get-away from high
lower-altitude temperatures, and her seat-
ing accommodation embodies all the
Dragon comforts with improvements.
She sets a new standard for Australian
air travel and looks like the first ideal
plane for Northern Australian commer-
cial conditions. A hundred of them in
service on interior routes would make
all the difference to North Queensland
and western N.S.W.
* * * *
. “Travel Stain”: Against the resident
who held a record number of posts in
Murgon (B. 14/3/’34) I enter A. J. F.
Draper, of Cairns (N.Q.). Draper was
a delegate to an A.S.P.A. conference
when he died. In the course of 40 years
he had been secretary, president or an
executive officer of the Barron Shire, Fire
Brigades Board, Hospitals Board, Cham-
ber of Commerce (he was vice-president
of the Associated Chambers when the
trumpet sounded), several sporting
bodies, including the Jockey Club and
Aquatic Club, Barron Falls Hydro-Elec-
tricity Board, U.C.G.A., A.S.P.A., Cane-
growers’ Council, Anzac Memorial Com-
mittee, Cairns Naval Brigade and
Artillery ; he was also a captain in the
Kennedy Regiment. In early times he
was a head of the Herberton Railway
League and the local Progress Associa-
tion, and one of the leaders of the seces-
sion movement which flourished in the
North in the early years of Federation.
He was chairman of the Mulgrave sugar
mill for 30 years, a principal of the
power-alcohol concern at Sarina, he long
ran the Cairns Show association and
built up a big business in his spare
minutes, besides owning the local daily.
Over the whole period he was Mayor
of Cairns more often than any other two
men.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: “Organised by the Austra-
lian Railways,” says a communique from
the Minister for Commerce proudly, “an
educational expedition consisting of 20
students from Sydney G.P.S. will leave
for Central Australia on May 7.”
The boys will pay fares of from
£2l to £24 according to age. It
is difficult to understand the mentality
of the people who organise these things
—almost as difficult as to estimate the
sort of ignorance out of which the
organisers tell the tourists that “the
Arunta tribes are the only race of people
in the world actually living under stones
age conditions,” a statement which is raw
nonsense. If educational tours are
arranged for youngsters, why not take
them to the hopeful part of the continent
instead of the hopeless part? Such a
trip will show them miles of salmon-
colored sandhills, a few settlers with
stations to sell, some iron shanties and
odd civil servants and camels. If they
are told that this country can be de-
veloped in the next few years, the lec-
tures will not be educational but propa-
ganda—tens of thousands of square miles
of similar country lies vacant in the most
thickly-populated continents. The money
would be far better spent showing them
the magnificent North Queensland lit-
toral, with its millions of pounds’ worth
of undeveloped resources, and Central
Queensland stations and mining towns.
“Australia Jane's” Budget
Should any public-minded citizen offer a
prize to the State with the greatest number of
1934 engagements and marriages in proportion
to population, Bananaland would be an easy
winner. At any and every party new diamond
rings fill the atmosphere with glitter; and sales
of wedding gifts should set many an erstwhile
despondent jeweller on his feet again.
Among the latest pairs to announce their
matrimonial intentions are Boyd Cullen and
Meryl Raff, belonging to two very old Queens-
land families. Boyd is one of the third genera-
tion of Queensland-born Cullens, and is a son
of Ted Cullen, for many years with the Harbors
and Rivers Department. The girl is a grand-
daughter of Alec Raff, who, with his brother
George, took up land in large quantities in the
very early days.
Maisie Stanley is going to England to be mar-
ried to Arthur Stephenson, and' has attended
many parties in her honor. If she carries with
her all the presents she has received she will
have a pretty bill for excess luggage.
Dr. Alec Paterson, son of the Frank Pater-
sons, of Toowoomba (Mrs. Paterson is a lead-
ing light in the C.W.A. and the Mothers’ Asso-
ciation and dad is a surveyor and an alderman),
has coaxed a promise true from Mary, daughter
of Mrs. Zoeller and of the late Carl Zoeller. Mrs.
Zoeller was a daughter of Luya, who repre-
sented South Brisbane in the days when flour
and aged eggs gave point to political criticism.
Gwen, only daughter of the James Stewarts,
of Yarraman, is wearing a ring purchased for
her by John, son of Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Penny,
of Ascot.
Thelma Smith, the Titian-haired social writer,
is laying down the pen for the broom and
rolling-pin of matrimony. The young man is
John Lewis, an engineer—as fortunate as he is
clever.
April 9 will see the wedding of Dorothy Sloan
and John MbPhee, and the bride-to-be is living
in a whirl of parties. Marie Reeve and F. H.
Dodd were married a few days ago, and that
bride also was tea’d and suppered until the
eleventh hour.
Beatrice Pugh, soprano, leaves Brisbane early
next month for London and the Continent,
where she will pursue her musical studies.
When Customs Minister White visited this
State, he found his paths strewn with old pals
who had been interned with him in Turkey.
Among them were Maurice, son of the Del-
pratts, of the Logan, and Dr. Jimmy Brown, of
Toowoomba. It was a lucky thing for quite a
few Queenslanders that Dr. Brown spent weary
months behind the wire, for he studied malaria
during his prisoner-of-wardom, and has been
able to do much to alleviate the sufferings of
men who contracted the recurring disease in
Palestine and Gallipoli.
F. E. Loxton, who is general manager here
for Burns, Philp, has word that son Colin ran
third in the 220 yards low hurdles in the Cam-
bridge-Oxford tourney at the White City, and
so qualified for his Blue. Elder brother Fred
Loxton, who hopes soon to be able to wear a
barrister’s wig, was a member of the Cambridge
wrestling team which defeated Oxford. Both
boys, formerly students of Melbourne Grammar
School, are at Pembroke College.
Betty Hughall, the light-footed lass who is in
demand wherever the saxophone is wailing out
dance numbers, has decided to turn her back
on Terpsichore. She is to enter a hospital for
nursing training, where her cheerful smile and
light step should be decided assets.
Muriel Billington (daughter of Dick Billing-
ton, who was a member of the now-vanished
firm of Carew, Gardner and Billington) and
Winnie Denham (younger daughter of ex-Pre-
mier Digby Denham) have not seen a great deal
of each other of late years, but their old friend-
ship remains. Therefore they decided to meet
in Japan, and admire the cherry-blossom to-
gether. Muriel paints exquisitely and should
get plenty of inspiration for the plates and
similar lovely trifles with which she gladdens
her friends on birthday and other anniversaries.
Fifi Billington, a half-sister of Muriel, already
is in China. When the mails left she was
contemplating a trip to Tientsin, provided no
battling armies lay in the route.
Sir Edmund Vestey and his lady spent a few
hours in Brisbane this week, en route to the
North, where the knight has many interests.
Major and Mrs. Wyatt, who recently arrived
from India, have bought a property in Too-
woomba, and intend to settle down there. Their
daughter, Mrs. Bowcher, and her captain hus-
band have been. staying with them, but return
to England next month.
Mrs. J. L. K. Gifford, with her husband, a
lecturer at Queensland Uni., has just spent two
years abroad, and last week she told the mem-
bers of the Queensland Citizenship League all
about living in Germany under the new con-
ditions. Mrs. Irene Longman occupied the
chair.
Canon O’Keefe, who has been headmaster of
All Souls’ School, Charters Towers, since 1925,
leaves for England next month on a holiday.
The Canon is still suffering from war wounds.
In 1914 he was a clergyman in the diocese of
Grafton, but enlisted as a private and saw a
good deal of active service before being com-
missioned on the field in 1917. He was badly
wounded near Ypres, and was sent back to
Australia. _ A spell of two years in Leura Mili-
tary Hospital followed, and in 1921 he went to
North Q’land for the sake of his health. Most
of his time in the Cold Country will be spent
in visiting public schools and studying advances
made in the educational world. He will return
to the North early next year.
Firmin McKinnon and his wife (she is one of
the leading spirits of the Lyceum Club, and the
soul of the Queensland Bush Book Club) are
spending a holiday in Sydney and have a flat
overlooking the harbor.
Mrs. Barrymore, better known to the Inky
Way as Freda Sternberg, is due in Sydney some
time this month. She is holidaying in Mel-
bourne at present, but will stay in Sydney before
returning to Townsville, her pens and ink and
her dogs and horses.

Is the poem “Casabianca” founded on fact ?
—646.
Yes. The boy who stood on the burning
deck was Giacomo Jocante de Casabianca. His
father, Louis de Casabianca, a French naval
officer, took command of the Orient at the
battle of the Nile, following the death of
Admiral Brueys. Rather than surrender, the
father blew up his ship after the crew had been
saved. The son, a boy of ten years of age,
refused to leave the ship and died with his
father. This heroic act was the theme of poems
by Ecouchard Lebrun and Andre Chenier, as
well as by Mrs. Hemans.

What steps have been taken towards estab-
lishing a university at Canberra ? —589.
A University College has been established
under the Canberra University College Ordi-
nance, 1929-32. By virtue of a regulation of
Melbourne Uni., the college is empowered to
provide approved lectures in the subjects of the
Arts, Science, Commerce and Law courses in
preparation for certain degrees and diplomas
of Melb. Uni. Lectures commenced in 1930,
and 30 students were enrolled during the year.
The curriculum was extended in 1931 and two
full-time lecturers were appointed. The students
now number about 60. The examinations are
conducted by Melb. Uni.
(1) Numbers of full-blooded and half-caste
aboriginals living in supervised camps in each
of the Australian States ? (2) How much does
each of the States spend on the protection and
care of aboriginals? —593.
(1) Figures are for June 30, 1932 (latest avail-
able). N.S.W.: Full-bloods, 368; half-castes,
2794. Vic.: 29 and 196. Q’land: 5812 and
1648. South Aus.: 109 and 557. West Aus.:
1589 and 630. N.T.: 2054 and 244. Total for
Commonwealth: 9961 full-bloods and 6069
half-castes. The native race is extinct in Tas-
mania. (2) The expenditure from consolidated
revenue in 1931-32 was: N.S.W., £53,124; Vic.,
£7153; Q’land, £41,128; South Aus., £23,000;
West Aus., £21,187 (exclusive of aboriginal
cattle stations, net revenue £2019); N.T., £7670
(including £1320 Govt, subsidy to aboriginal
mission stations); total for Australia, £153,262.
How was the Northern Territory transferred
to the Commonwealth ? —598.
On December 7, 1907, the Commonwealth
and the State of South Australia entered into
an agreement. Approval was given by the South
Aus. Parliament under the Northern Territory
Surrender Act, 1907 (assented to on May 14,
1908), and by the Commonwealth Parliament
under the Northern Territory Acceptance Act,
1910 (assented to on November 16, 1910). The
Territory accordingly was transferred to the
Commonwealth by proclamation on January 1,
1911.
(1) Definition of “classic” ? (2) Are there
any twentieth-century classics of English fic-
tion ? Names of two or three ? (3) Has Aus-
tralia produced any classical works of litera-
ture ? (4) Can the term “classic” be applied
to literary works by authorities on scientific
subjects ? (5) Can such constructions as the
Sydney Harbor Bridge and the Panama Canal
be termed classic examples of engineering ?
532.
(1) In the narrowest sense, the best literary
and artistic achievements of Greece and Rome;
more generally, any work of acknowledged
excellence and authority. (2) Yes. Dickens’s
“David Copperfield,” Thackeray’s “Vanity
Fair ” Scott’s “Old Mortality.” (3) Not yet,
though Marcus Clarke has been admitted to
the “Encyclopaedia Britannica,” and his “For
the Term of His Natural Life” is there de-
scribed as “a powerful tale.” (4) The term is
so applied to various works which continue to
hold the field as authoritative textbooks, but
the sciences develop so rapidly that what was
regarded as a classic last year may be sup-
planted this. (5) In the broadest sense, yes, as
meaning the most important examples ot tne
application of certain defined engineering
principles.
What are “Baily’s Beads,” said to be visible
during eclipses of the sun?—-4 83.
It is a phenomenon first fully described by
Francis Baily, an English astronomer. Owing
to the effect of irradiation and the irregularity
of the moon’s edge, the crescent-shaped portion
of the sun that is unobscured by the moon s
disc looks like a belt of bright spots in a dark
background, which may be compared to a
string of beads.
What are Bengal lights used for, and what
are they made from ? —447. .
They are signal lights used at sea. Ingredients
are nitre 6, sulphur 2 and black sulphide o
antimony 1, by weight, ground to a powder,
dried and mixed. When this is lighted a most
brilliant blue light which illuminates the sea
for many miles around is the result. It is used
in cases’of shipwreck.
(1) Did the Vic. Government in Nov., 1902,
take the Police Pensions Fund and pay it into
consolidated revenue ? (2) What Government
was in power at the time ? (3) Is there any
system of pensions payable to members who
joined the Vic. police force before Nov., 1902,
and how is it financed ? (4) Where could I
see a balance sheet of the fund for the year
ending June 30, 1933? (5) Is there a pensions
fund for members who joined the force aftei
Nov., 19027—522.
(1) No. (2) The Irvine Government was in
office. (3) Yes, the Police Superannuation Fund,
sources of revenue of which are £2OOO
from consolidated revenue; a contribution ot
21 pc of pay from members of the force
entitled to benefits from the fund; fines inflicted
on members of the force for breaches of dis-
cipline, and certain court fines appropriated to
the fund by Acts of Parliament; transfers from
the Licensing Fund under Section 311 of the
Licensing Act, and votes in aid in the annual
Appropriation Act. (4) Balance sheet posted.
(5) Yes, it is called the Police Pensions Fund,
and is distinct from the Police Superannuation
Fund.
(1) Are compasses fitted into aeroplanes
affected by steel or iron built into the ’plane ?
(2) If so, are aeroplane compasses compensated
and adjusted in the same manner as a ship’s
compass ? (3) If compensated an,d adjusted
will those compasses show magnetic or true
direction of ’plane’s head ? (4) Will an aero-
plane’s motors, running at high speeds, affect
the compass ? —412.
(1) Yes. (2) Yes, but no compensation is
made for the effect of soft-iron magnetism. (3)
Magnetic. (4) Yes, owing to magnetic fields
set up by ignition system. Usually the com-
pass is situated far enough away from the
engines to make this effect negligible.
(1) How long has Australia been a member of
the League of Nations ? (2) What mandates
does she hold for the League ? (3) Is she an
active member ? (4) What does she contribute
towards cost ? —624.
(1) Australia was an original signatory, on
June 28, 1919. (2) One over the former Ger-
man territory of New Guinea, and, by agree-
ment with Great Britain and M.L., one over
the phosphate island of Nauru, for which a
mandate was issued to the British Empire.
(3) On October 2, 1933, Australia was
elected a non-permanent member of the Coun-
cil of the League of Nations, and will now be
called upon to participate in greater measure than
formerly in the work of the organisation. The
Commonwealth has been represented at each
Assembly of the League since its inauguration,
and at nearly all of the conferences of the
International Labor Organisation. (4) Last
year’s payment was £63,000.
(1) By what Act did the Commonwealth
accept a portion of Antarctica as Common-
wealth territory? (2) What is the location of
the portion and what is it now called ? —620.
(1) and (2) By Act No. 8 of 1933 that part of
the territory in the Antarctic Seas which com-
prises all the islands and territories, other than
Adelie Land, situated south of the 60th degree
South latitude and lying between the 160th
degree East longitude and the 45th degree East
longitude was declared to be accepted by the
Commonwealth as the Australian Antarctic
Territory.
(1) After whom did Capt. Cook name Port
Jackson ? Can you give me a few details con-
cerning his career? (2) There are some who
maintain that it was named after a seaman on
the Endeavour. How did that story arise ? —6lO.
(1) After George Jackson (1725-1822), Secre-
tary of the Navy Board, later Second Secretary
to the Admiralty, and after that Judge-Advo-
cate of the Fleet. He was also at various times
a member of Parliament. In 1797 he assumed
the name of Duckett by royal license to con-
form with the conditions of a bequest, and is
generally referred to in reference books as Sir
George Duckett, having been knighted. He
gave a long-continued patronage to Cook, who
began life as a stable-boy on the estate of
Jackson’s sister at Ayton in Yorkshire; it was
probably his influence with Lord Sandwich
that gave Cook command of the Endeavour,
and Cook recognised his help by naming after
him Port Jackson in N.S.W. and Point Jackson
in M.L. (2) Jackson’s subsequent change of
name obscured his connection with the naming
of the locality and thus caused a legend to
arise (believed by Dr. Lang) that Port Jackson
had been named after a seaman who sighted
it from the Endeavour’s masthead. Research
has shown that there was no one of the name of
Jackson in the Endeavour’s crew.
How do the Chinese make soup out of birds'
nests 7 —639.
Edible nests are produced by species of
swifts, or swiftlets, in the Malay islands and
Australia. In the case of most mud-nest-build-
ing birds saliva is secreted to mix With the
mud, but the secretory glands of the swiftlets
are so developed that the use of mud and other
matter is abandoned, the nest being formed
almost or entirely of the bird s own secretion.
It is these nests which are used by the Chinese
for making soup. In the Malay islands are
large remote caves where the swifts have built
for many centuries, and these are leased to col-
lectors who export millions of nests annually
to China. The nests are taken as soon as
they are made and while still white and pure,
those that contain foreign matter or those that
are old and yellow not being of edible value.
How much do the police forces of the respec-
tive States cost, and what is their cost per head
1931-32, N.S.W
£1,430,033 (11s. 4d per head of population);
Vic., £783,390 (Bs. 8d.); Queensland, £499,330
(10s. 4d.); South Aus., £294,244 (105..1d.);
West. Aus., £207,653 (9s. lOd.); Tas., £80,505
(7s. 3d.).
Who was Melusina or Melusine in mediceval
folk-lore ? Where can l get a full account of
A mermaid in French folk-lore; the daugh-
ter of Elinas, King of Albania. She married
Count Raymond on the condition that he would
never seek her on Saturdays, when she was
accustomed to shut herself up alone. When
they were married she built him a castle called
Lusignan Castle. Raymond broke his promise
and did visit her on a Saturday, so she changed
into a serpent and escaped from the castle by
a window. According to legend she has ever
since visited the castle uttering cries a little
time before the death of a lord of Lusignan.
Hence the expression “Cris de Melusine,” which
is still heard in some provinces in France.
Jean d’Arras made this legend the subject of
one of his stories in 1387. See Dunlop’s “His-
tory of Fiction” and Baring Gould’s “Curious
Myths of the Middle Ages.”
Description of an ophicleide ? —645.
An obsolete brass wind instrument consisting
of a conical brass tube, bent double, with a
cupped mouthpiece, and forming the bass or
alto to the key bugle. It superseded the instru-
ment called “the serpent,” and was developed
about the beginning of the nineteenth century.
The number of keys was usually eleven, <?n the
usual harmonic open notes of all brass instru-
ments.
What is a palindrome ? —641.
A form of composition which reads the same
either backwards or forwards. A Latin example
is “Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor.” An
example in English is “Able was I ere I saw
Elba,” supposed to have been said by Bona-
parte. Another, supposed to be the longest
palindrome in English, is “Dog a devil deified,
deified lived a god.”
What is the municipal rate in the city of
Sydney? —297. . , ,
General rate, 4^d.; bridge rate, one-third of
a penny; main roads rate, 7-32nds of a penny
in the £, all levied on unimproved capital value.
Was there more than one William Adams
making pottery at Stafford , England , at the end
of the eighteenth century ? If so, were they
related, and which of them introduced copper-
plate printing into the pottery craft 3—687.
There were three, all master potters. One
William Adams was born at Stoke-on-Trent in
1772; another, born in 1750, had the pottery
of Brick House, Burslem, and also a pottery
at Cobridge; a third was William Adams the
master potter at Tunstall, who died in 1805.
They were all cousins, and William was the
traditional name for the eldest sons of the
family. William Adams, of Brick Hpuse, Burs-
lem, introduced copper-plate printing, which
was copied by Spode, Shelton, Badderley and
Minton.
I have taken up oil-painting and have trouble
with my brushes, although I keep them in tur-
pentine. How do professional artists care for
their ? —692. . . ,
To keep brushes in turpentine ’ constantly
spoils the textural quality of the bristles and
ruins the shape of the brush. The best thing
for general cleansing is water cold or just warm,
never hot, and common kitchen soap. Dip the
brush in water and then hold it against the bar
of soap, rubbing it from side to side, then force
it against the soap so that the bristles are
spread out. If you are painting every day just
wipe the brushes clean on your paint rag and
wrap them in a rag moistened with either oil
or water, giving them a soap wash once a
week. This treatment is for bristle brushes;
sables may be cleaned with kerosene. Stand
the brushes up when not in use, handle down-
wards in a dry jar.
Dates of the storms which visited ( a ) Mackay
and (b) Innisfail during the early part of 1918,
the extent of the damage and the number
of lives lost ? —564. ...
fa) On January 20-21, 1918, a tropical storm
brought disaster. Twenty lives were lost; many
of the buildings in Mackay were damaged or
completely demolished; the bridge across the
Pioneer River (connecting North and South
Mackay) was wrecked, and several small
steamers, lighters and motor-boats were either
wrecked or left stranded on shore. The cyclone
was accompanied by a “storm wave” of about
four feet, which swept up the river on top of
a high tide and caused considerable damage by
flooding. Barometric pressure fell to 27.55 in.
(&) On the night of March 10, 1918, a tropical
storm struck and crossed the coastline in the
neighborhood of Flying Fish Point, and, travel-
ling inland, wrecked or damaged almost every
building in Innisfail. Other centres that suf-
fered severely were Babinda, Cairns and Her-
berton. From the seaboard to the Atherton
Tableland vegetation was torn and stripped
almost bare of leaves and branches. Sixteen
lives were lost. Barometric pressure fell
to 27.88 in. The storm was considered more
severe than the Mackay cyclone, though the
latter was of longer duration and accompanied
by heavier rain.
What is Australia’s record in the matter of
yyiptonvitP V ? 549.
About 70 meteorites have been found, well
distributed over Australia; 40 are siderites,
five siderolites and 19 aerolites; rest unidenti-
fied The largest, a siderite weighing nearly
34- tons, was found at Cranbourne .in Vic. ; it
is in the Natural History Museum in London.
Three —picked up at Mount Brown, Emma-
ville and Binda —were seen to fall. At Emma-
ville (N.S.W.) a house was struck by a soz.
aerolite. The pallasite group of siderolites,
characterised by much olivine, is represented
by three falls—at Bendoc (Vic.) and at Molong
and Mount Dynning (N.S.W.) respectively.

Dear Sirs,
No doubt you will be interested to
hear of the performance of the Bedford
IP'S which we purchased through your
Avenel dealer last November.
We built a Semi-Trailer for this job,
and immediately put it into heavy work,
and since this it has been operating over
all kinds of roads, and with all classes of
loads, the maximum being 6\ tons and
the average 4\ tons.
The job is quite economical to operate,
the average petrol consumption being
approximately 15 m.p.g., and until 18,000
miles had been done, it was not necessary
to add any make up oil at the motor.
The after-sales service and assistance
given by your dealer leaves nothing to
be desired.
Wishing you every success with the
Bedford, —Yours faithfully,
Whiteman & Sons,

THE PALETTE.
An exhibition by young painters of
the Sydney Art School, recently at the
Macquarie Galleries, contained promising
pictures. J. Richard Ashton upholds the
family’s third-generation reputation with
marine pieces, “The Windjammer” and
“Picking Up the Tugs,” clean in color,
well drawn and full of the magic of the
sea. Joshua Smith shows an interior in
which the lighting is capital, and a
portrait that is a fine study of character.
Clive Wilbow is represented by a still-life
—onions and a bottle—which says every-
thing that can be said about the subject;
and Harold Abbot deals with cabbages
in a more imaginative but not less satis-
fying fashion. Jean Bellette, who has
a gift for draughtsmanship and a sure,
confident style, presents glimpses of Syd-
ney in which romanticism does not
involve distortion. William Dobell in
. “Reflections” has produced an interior
study of striking merit. If Julian Ashton’s
school had produced no more than the
42 pictures that comprise this interesting
little show it would have justified its long
existence.
Forty years ago it would have been
necessary for a critic who liked the paint-
ings of Robert Johnson, a selection of
which is shown in the Grosvenor Gal-
leries (Sydney), to defend them against a
charge of impressionism. To-day the only
heresy with which they can be connected
is literalism. Johnson’s transcripts from
the scene before him are not “precious.”
They don’t pretend that trees in the fresh
leaf, with the sun behind the observer,
are brown, but they state emphatically
that in certain conditions of light they are
jolly near black, and that’s a statement
of fact. Johnson, like Streeton and
Barron and the Vic. water-colorist Her-
bert, looks at things with the eye of the
common man. His distances look dis-
tant. He has an immense facility with
distances. He can paint river water and
sea water so that they look as these things
look to the common eye. When he paints
urban Sydney, as in “Saint James’s” and
“Saint Mary’s,” he credits the architects
of the churches and other buildings with
human intelligence. When he paints a
scene in Maoriland (vide “Mount Eden,
Auckland”) he makes the man who looks
at the picture realise the difference
between the M.L. and the Australian
light. In fact he paints what he sees and
what he feels, and does it honestly. As
studies of interior lighting his “Shearing
Shed Sketch” and “Wool Press” are re-
markable for their fidelity.
S.A. Society of Arts’ first show for
the season is by Esmond George, just off
to Europe for more experience. Vigor
is his chief note. His sweeps of cliff and
shore are free from the overcarefulness
of some feminine rivals, and he does
not shrink from dashing in warm con-
trasting masses of green and blue. Mean-
while, young Elizabeth Skottowe at
Preece’s gallery has a strange show of
figures in heavy water-color, looking
almost like colored woodcuts. Eyes
always small triangles, mouths always
large triangles, breasts in painted circles
like a target, and long, narrow sexless
bodies do not make for charm, but they
have power, which is more important.
The whole show looks like a bad dream
of Aubrey Beardsley, but the very-young
artist will curb her imagination presently
and do good work. Meanwhile, her odd
fancies sell amazingly well.
The total receipts of the Melbourne District
Nursing Society 1933 appeal are £8175-odd,
£l7Bl of which came from general donations.
Expenses were £527, leaving a credit balance of
£7,647 14s. sd. The society thanks all who
helped the appeal.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney Anglicans have welcomed
their new shepherd. He is tall and kindly
looking, and from what one hears of
him he has the eye that sees the shorn
lamb as well as the wool-laden prize
merino of the pastures. Complete with
crook he looked an archgaiters to be
proud of. The enthronement, which took
place in St. Andrew’s, was impressively
simple. The boys of the C. of E. schools
lined the path from the Chapter House
to the cathedral. Along it walked the
Archbishop, attended by two choirboys
in red and white. Now everyone was
waiting for the three knocks by which
Anglican archbishops precede their re-
quest for induction. When they came,
clear and incisive, as later was the epis-
copal voice in sermon and blessing, an
audible sigh went up from the crowded
pews, and outside the waiting hundreds
said with one voice “The three knocks.”
Instantly the great door opened, and the
Archbishop-elect having declared that he
would accept the constitutions of the
phurch, the pastoral staff was placed in
his hands by Bishop Kirkby. And so, to
the triumphant notes of the “Te Deum,”
Archbishop Mowll took possession of his
cathedral church.
The bishops came to the ceremony in
their scarlet robes and had their wide
lawn sleeves tied at the wrist with narrow
scarlet ribbon. Both they and the clergy
wore their academic hoods —scarlet,
purple and black, blue or fur-trimmed.
Blue was worn by two little deaconesses,
but all this faded into insignificance
beside the rich, Wolsey-red robe and
hood of the Archbishop, seen at its best
as he, preceded by the Dean of St.
Andrew’s and the Diocesan Administrator
(Bishop Kirkby), and followed by other
bishops and clergy, walked from the
cathedral to the Chapter House.
Temporal power, in the person of the
State Governor, Sir Philip Game, came
to show honor to the new occupant of the
see. With him were Lady Game, Philip,
David and Rosemary, Mrs. de Witt
Batty, wife of the Bishop of Grafton,
Mrs. Ashton, wife of the Bishop of New-
castle, General A. T. Anderson and
Lieut.-Commander Gifford. The Premier
and Mrs. Stevens were also in high places,
as were Lud Mayor Parker and his
lady. Mrs. Mowll sat well up in the
front; next her was Bishop Kirkby’s
wife, and not far away the Dean of Syd-
ney’s wife. Law was represented by
Judge Backhouse and knight Alexander
Gordon. Among delegates from other
denominations a picturesque figure was
Archimandrite Nicodemas, of the Greek
Orthodox Church.
Two who followed the ceremony with
unusual interest were knight Alexander
Gordon and M.L. Governor Bledisloe’s
nephew “Bill” Bathurst. The former’s
interest lay in the fact that the beautiful
silver amethyst-studded pastoral staff was
the gift of his father to St. Andrew’s;
the latter’s, because of his intention to
study for the church, for which -purpose
he sails shortly for England, leaving be-
hind him a number of friends made dur-
ing the 12 months he has been in the
northern districts getting experience on
the land.
After the enthronement came a lun-
cheon at which the Archbishop was the
guest of the clergy and laity of Sydney
diocese. In the evening he was given
a public welcome. Long before eight
o’clock the Town Hall was packed, and
applause loud and long greeted the Arch-
bishop when he made his appearance with
the State Governor and Mrs. Mowll.
Speeches were limited to five minutes, no
exception being made for the Governor
or for the Premier, so that both speakers
md listeners had an easy time. The Arch-
bishop was not so limited, and, no matter
what he felt like, he smilingly carried on
to the end of a very hard day.
The garden party for the archiepiscopal
Mowlls was a great success. The sky was
blue, a not-too-hot sun shone down on
the green lawns of Cranbrook School,
and in the distance the harbor glinted
and sparkled bluey-green and purple like
a huge opal. The handshaking took place
at the foot of the shallow steps leading
to the verandah of the cream stone house,
before which the Union Jack floated.
Mrs. Mowll smiled under a shady black
Bangkok hat lined with shell pink, her
dress of black crepe being patterned in
field flowers. Sir Philip Game brought
Lady Game, serene and cool-looking in
her wide hat of cream straw and her
ivory crepes printed in black leaves.
Brigadier-General Mackay’s better-half
(he’s the headmaster) wore white and
black ; Dean Talbot’s little wife chose for
her small velvet hat and suit the right
shade to show up her auburn hair ; cinna-
mon brown was worn by Rose Merivale.
Wherever you went or looked, you found
bishops and their wives. Children from
Carlingford and Havilah performed folk
dances on the lawns, and plenty of good
cheer was provided by the “Mothers of
Cranbrook.”
Friday was Diggers’ Day, so there was
no escape ; sooner or later you bought a
tin hat. Night found business still brisk
in Martin-place. The monkeys (two sat
in cars) brought many a shilling, to the
fund. Chocolate wheels, housie-housie
stall and the dogs were other popular
money-spinners.
How few of us on the rare occasions
when we visit the Australian Museum
realise that behind the store of fossils
and curios there are the hand and brain
of youth! Elsie Bramell, the girl in this
Howard Harris photograph, has just en-
tered the twenties, and she is hard at
work classifying and arranging the
material culture of primitive peoples.
Elsie, who was born at Port Moresby,
naturally has made a special study
of the native races of New Guinea and
Melanesia. Head-hunters and their ways
are an open book to her —she can even
tell you some of their recipes. Lectures
and articles upon subjects of anthropolo-
gical interest come into her daily round,
and archaeology and numismatics are two
other subjects the young scientist toys
with. Miss Bramell is a graduate of
Sydney Uni., where she gained a diploma
in education.
Elsie Lundgren’s wedding to Alexis
Albert at St. Philip’s was like a little girl’s
dream come true. Elsie is the daughter
of a Swedish family—Captain and Mrs.
A. E. Lundgren, of Kirribilli —so she
wore, as is the bridal custom of her
parents’ country, a pearl-tipped, seven-
pointed, delicately-wrought crown of
silver. This held in place the cascades
of tulle which rippled into billows of
foam over the long train of her wedding
garment. Her severely classical frock of
white net (layers and layers went to the
making of it) had a deep, circular cape
and long, tight sleeves. Golden-rayed
lilies, lilies-of-the-valley and silver leaves
added to the ethereal effect. Sister Mrs.
Hans Sundstrom was matron of honor,
and Lola de Dardel and Jean Nield
’maided, their silver baskets spilling over
with gloriosas. Turquoise-blue ring velvet
went to the fashioning of their trained
frocks and the crown of their hats,
which were otherwise of tulle and wide
of brim. Toasts were drunk at the Royal
Yacht Squadron’s clubhouse. Reflected
in the waters of the harbor were the
thousands of electric lamps amber, blue,
ruby-red and emerald—which lighted the
grounds and outlined the clubhouse.
The names Cazabon and English,
already well known in musical circles, are
going to be still more widely known if
sons John and George have their way.
“Good Catch” the new musical comedy
to be produced at the Savoy to-night and
to-morrow night, is the joint work of
the two juniors, and Lou, the leading
role, will be played by the subject of
this Desmond Woolley photograph, the
sparkling-eyed, dark-haired Mrs. Keitn
Walker. The door money goes to swell
the funds of the Royal Prince Alfred
Hospital auxiliary.
The dahlias held their show last week,
but, being garden-minded, they allowed
the roses, zinnias, carnations and even the
ruby-red coxcomb to add to the beauty
of the aisles of the Town Hall through
which flower-lovers passed. Visitors in-
cluded schoolgirls, mechanics straight
from the foundry, clerks and typists, and
women in their chiffons on their way to
or from parties made time to slip in for a
few minutes and take a note of the name
of anything special that caught their eye.
Kathleen Norris, a gorgeous pink bloom,
carried away the championship. State
Ex. Game, looking at the flowers with a
wistful eye, recalled happy hours When he
put on his oldest clothes, enjoyed the
punishment of weeds and the encourage-
ment of good garden stuff, and took tips
from visitors rather than be lured from
man’s oldest occupation.
Isabel Gullett, Marjorie Quinn, “Man-
Shy” Davison’s sister Lyall, Mrs. Harry
Dransfield, cartoonist Ted Scorfield’s
wife and the John Daileys were a few
of the many who found their way to
Pyrmont to cheer Sydney writer Nora
McAuliffe as she boarded the Port Bris-
bane on the first lap of her scamper over
Europe, and, incidentally, had a look at
the bathing-pool and the tennis deck.
Among the 12 passengers on this boat
were Charlie Morgan Jones, Isabel
Campbell, Lois Linsley and Mrs. M.
O’Connor and daughter Pat. Congratu-
lations on Miss O’Connor’s engagement
were still pouring in as the boat’s gang-
way was being raised.
Yass, which had its picnic race meet-
ing and ball last week-end, comes third
in order of social precedence after Bong
Bong and Tiranna. There was a record
crowd at the much-improved March-
mont course on Saturday, but there was
a notable shortage of well-known locals.
Hardly any Osbornes, though most of the
best-known Osborne stations, such as
Currandooley and Bowylie, are in the
vicinity, and few Canberra residents. Sir
Michael Nairn, Bart., his wife, son and
daughter were conspicuous visitors;
Mrs. James Ashton stood them one of
the famous Yass racecourse teas. It was
riot so new and strange to them as might
have been expected. Sir Michael’s
youngest sister married Bruce Thomas, of
N. S. Wales, shortly after the war, and
the family has heard all about Australia
from him. Irene Anderson was among
the pretty Sydney girls present. After
the meeting she left to join the Oronsay.
Mrs. Sep Levy has left Wilga, which
is one of the most expensive flats in
Sydney, for a smaller one at Manar in
Macleay-street. Wilga has a romantic
history. It was built by Chief Justice
James Martin on what was then believed
to be the most beautiful site in Sydney.
The garden ran down to the water, and
the view to the Heads was, and is, un-
surpassed. He was a classicist, and when
he had finished with his new home it
resembled a Roman villa. After his
death his widow went with her large
family to Woollahra House, and the
Wylde-street mansion passed through
many vicissitudes until the vogue for
luxury flats began. It was then re-
modelled and divided into two immense
apartments. Mr. and Mrs. Stewart Daw-
son took the top one, and the Sep Levys
the one on the ground floor. The garden,
though much curtailed, is exquisite, and
the dining- and drawing-rooms both over-
look the harbor.
Florence Taylor, architect and town-
planner, left for Japan last week for the
holiday her health demands. The Arts
Club—she is its president —gave her a
farewell luncheon, and members and
friends rolled up over 300 strong. The
guest of honor, pale and picturesque in
glowing white silk and a leaf-green lace
hat, was frankly pleased with the mani-
festation of affection. Aubrey Halloran
proposed her health in poetic prose
adorned by flowery quotations. Next
morning the same crowd turned up at
the boat and sang a farewell chorus com-
posed by an anonymous member.
Coming out of the arid, sun-drenched
street, it was refreshing to find that
Robert Johnson had hung the walls ot
the Grosvenor Galleries with canvases
of such things as gums, running water,
cliffs and mountains. Dr. Arthur Mose-
ley said the opening words, while Mrs.
Moseley stood by, her rose sunshade
glowing against her black-and-white
crepes. Wal Taylor was soon busy stick-
ing on red seals (over £2OO worth of can-
vases were sold within the hour), and
Mrs. Johnson beamed her approval at
these practical signs of appreciation ot
her husband’s work. Artist Kenneth
Macqueen’s mother, in green linens, and
sister Meg, in blue, discovered that many
of the spots depicted were old favorites
of theirs. Slim Margaret Gardner,
daughter of the medical Gardners, of
Toorak, found the walls alluring; so did
the fair Edith Board, Clare Butters wore
a green suit, but this was not so green
as the green shirt worn by Woodward
Smith.
The silver boomerangs which the Aus-
tralian Eleven will wear as mascots dur-
ing their tour came to them from the
women of far-west Queensland. It was
Mrs. Margaret Leeds’s idea, and it was
so enthusiastically acted upon that before
you could turn round 16 of these abo.
weapons found themselves in the post,
together with a letter of good wishes, in
a box of beautifully polished Queensland
wood.

Chatter
When the Barrett lady and daughter
Cara heard of their many friends who are
having their passports brought up to date
they decided to order sherry and run a
party with the prospective travellers as
guests of honor. The H. L. Setchell
couple were at the function ; the Rene
Vanderkelens were there (they are off to
Belgium for six months), also Ethel
Spowers, who takes her trip to the other
side of the world via the spicy East
Indies. Edith Noall came with her pre-
sentation umbrella from a good-bye cup
of tea at the E.-S.U., where she is secre-
tary ; she has chosen the U.S.A. route
to England. Other nuclei of the chatty
groups were the Thorold Harper couple,
Mrs. W. Noall, who has her eyes fixed
on Nippon, Marjorie Forbes and the
Normand Hills pair, who are off to Eng-
land.
The Goodwill Mission to the Orient em-
barked upon the first stage of its journey
among a fanfare of trumpets and waving
of streamers. The mission consists of
Attorney-General Latham, his wife,
daughter, woman secretary, two men sec-
retaries, a customs officer—who, inciden-
tally, _ will be useful with the excess
luggage—and one or two more members
who were picked up in Sydney. While
the members were getting their streamers
tangled round huge bouquets on the
Nieuw Zeeland another delegation was
being no less noisily farewelled (though
without floral accessories) on the Jervis
Bay. It consisted of four workers’ repre-
sentatives off to Soviet Russia. One is
named Shakespeare; another is Gold-
smith.
Philip Hudson, with the help of his
mother, Mrs. T. J. Hudson, opened the
doors of their home, Grantham, South
Yarra, to prospective travellers Margaret
and Dorothy Raws and a host of their
young friends. Grantham, one of Mel-
bourne’s most interesting old houses,
glowed with the fire of zinnias, petunias
and dahlias for the party. Among those
who partook of late-afternoon sherry
were the Best twins Helene and Roberta,
Peggy and .Gwen Hornabrook, Annette
Powell, Patricia Mein, John Rivett, David
Alsop and John Howse.
Parties of last week included Mar-
garet Shann’s coming-of-age celebrations,
for which the new elector carried a
posy of pastel flowers against her tur-
quoise and silver flamisol. Margaret’s
mother and father (he is Head of Trinity
Grammar, Kew) hovered between the
bridge-ing and the dancing guests. The
cake rose in glittersome tiers above a
forest of pink and deep-red snapdragons.
Dr. and Mrs. Basil Kilvington chose
bridge as a means and No. 9 as a loca-
tion for dispensing hospitality. Both
hostess and her daUghter-in-law Mrs.
Trevor Kilvington were in lace, the,
former’s choice being black, the latter’s
beige with the addition of a little gold
cape. Daughter -in - law -to- be Lorna
Bryant was clad all in pink. Mr. and
Mrs. C. H. A. Eager, Dr. and Mrs. Clive
Disher and Dr. and Mrs. Newman
Morris were among the card-shufflers.
The associates’ president’s day at Yarra
Yarra fell in the midst of the heat-wave,
and only the do-or-die souls got into
golfing kit and pursued the little white
ball in Canadian foursomes. A far
greater number reclined in the clubhouses
among gladioli, hydrangeas and berries.
Tea was very festive, president Mrs.
Clarence Marriott scattering her hospi-
tality in white spotted with navy. Mrs.
G. S. Reddan and Mrs. J. Brownell, Mrs.
Drew and Mrs. Doughton, Mrs. Dawson
Kirk and Mrs. M. Indemar were among
those who commenced the year by pluck-
ing spoil.
The fashionable St. John’s, Toorak,
opened its portals for a wedding with
Gwenyth Blogg and Keith Mcßoberts in
the leading roles. Over the bridal gown
of snowflake triple ninon fell a Limerick
lace veil upon its quivering foundation
of tulle, its attachment being a Russian
headdress of lace and orange buds.
Bride’s sisters Elaine and Betty and Olive
Thomson slid their fingers among bright
dahlias in little flower muffs and them-
selves into a melting of three autumn
shades upon •crinkle chiffon. Felicita-
tions fell among toasts and teacups at
Edzell, St. George’s-road.
Gwen Mattingley and Kenneth Francis
Nesbit kept an evening appointment
against an all-gold background in St.
John’s Church of England, Camberwell.
Taffeta faille in the tint of ripening
apricots, puffed and frilled at the back
and rucked down the sleeves with lame
pipings, was the bride’s choice for her
frock. A Limerick lace veil over bubbles
of tulle foundation was attached to a
halo of orange buds. Dorothy Matting-
ley and Chris McPherson performed their
duties with assistance of baskets filled
with delphiniums and pale-gold chiffon
twisted into draperies, bows and fichus.
Rejoicings were at Grosvenor.
Something unusual in wedding attire
was Ethel Thompson’s choice of desert-
sand Velvet and a black velvet hat with
a swaying picture brim. A boat-shaped
neck emerged from a fichu cape, and a
train swept after the slim, sleeveless gar-
ment. The bride had no attendants and
carried instead of flowers a vanity bag
to match her gown. The man who waited
at Scotch College Chapel was Herbert,
son of the late Henry Miskin. His bride
is the daughter of the late Charles A.
Thompson, of Gippsland and Manly,
N.S.W. Intimate friends rejoiced at No. 9.
Ronald Esler’s camera has caught the
smile of Mrs. Fleming-Dunstan, who is
clever as well as attractive. She finds
time to keep flexible her lyric soprano,
to retain her knowledge of languages,
run a doctor’s household and entertain
more than ever since two daughters are
now grown up—the third is still at school.
Mrs. Fleming-Dunstan studied singing
abroad before her marriage, and five
years ago visited Europe— not on a pleas-
ure jaunt, but on a voyage of discovery
into modern music. She worked hard,
sometimes taking three lessons a day in
different branches of her art; and for
refreshers followed the sun to Algiers
or winter sports to Switzerland. Her
garden is another hobby; so is the
“Glacie,” where she and the girls skate
all through the winter. She is the wife
of Dr. Fleming-Dunstan, of Brighton.
Free Kindergartens are always hard
up and the work of directors, students
and committees is never-ending. The
Balaclava and East St. Kilda branch
chose a fete on St. Pat.’s Day for its
first effort this year at tapping the public’s
purse. Mrs. Stanley Wilson turned her
home in Burns-street, St. Kilda, over to
the good cause —her daughter is a
“kindie” voluntary helper. In the garden
were lucky dips, produce, cake and toy
stalls and a fat docile Shetland for 3d.
per ride. A fortune-teller lurked behind
a curtain, there was the usual swarm of
raffles and the Blind Institute’s orchestra
provided music on the verandah. Mrs.
T. W. White performed the opening, and
Mrs. John Tucker, Mrs. A. Davenport,
Mrs. Neville Hollinshed, Mrs. D. J.
Sioman and director Dora Harcourt were
among the busy workers.
Lecturer-in-entomology Janet Raff is
off to use her year’s leave of absence in
Europe. Miss Raff never spends a holi-
day in an ordinary manner: she has a
true scientist’s love of her job and always
carries bottles in her pocket ready for
the capture of some interesting beastie.
She has an intimate understanding with
the sawfly and knows all about the very
unpleasant but world-famous Gippsland
worm which grows to the length of 10
feet.
Artist Violet Teague must be a pleased
and proud woman at the sympathy which
has developed for the project to give the
Hermannsburg Mission an improved
water supply. Many travellers have pene-
trated the parched interior north of Alice
Springs and returned with sympathy
for the mission’s difficulties. Miss
Teague, who has been transferring the
dazzling pinks and purples of Centralia
to her canvases, was so touched that she
launched an exhibition of pictures by
Melbourne artists at the Athenaeum, pro-
ceeds going towards a proposed five-mile
pipe line. Writers followed with auto-
graphed copies of their books, private
donations have rolled in and the £lBOO
required doesn’t look impossible of
achievement. It did at first.
Adelaide speaking:
A welcome cool change made the farewell
dance for the visiting bowlers, held at the
Palais Royal, a great success. The crowd num-
bered about 1500.
There was a large throng in the Mayoress’s
reception-room when Lud Mayor Cain and his
daughter, Mrs. H. Dunstan, welcomed Rear-
Admiral Dalglish and other officers of the
R.A.N. Mrs. Dunstan looked cool in a white
linen swagger suit and a wide-brimmed white
straw hat. Mrs. Dudley Hayward, who came
with her guests the Rear-Admiral and Flag
Lieut.-Commander Marshall, wore brown crepe
de Chine faintly patterned in beige, and her
small brown straw hat was banded with beige
roses. The Bruce lady chose white chiffon,
flowered in black, and a wide-brimmed white
straw hat with a black crown.
A number of Adelaide’s pretty girls, present
at the morning reception, induced the naval
men to attend the fashion parade in the after-
noon in aid of the Lord Mayor’s Relief Fund,
at which they appeared as mannequins. The
officers’ white linen uniforms were appropriate
to a sweltering day. The floral decorations
were beautiful.
At a civic reception to English bandmaster
Captain Adkins, the Lud Mayor’s welcome was
seconded by knight David Gordon. Captain
Adkins said with a grin that won forgiveness—
it was a very hot afternoon —that he thought
Adelaide might be aptly described as a suburb
of hell.
In spite of the heat there was a big roll-up
at the Town Hall when the A.B.C. Band gave
its first concert. His Ex. and Lady Hore-
Ruthven were accompanied by Mrs. Lance
Lewis.
For the Charity Cabaret held at Mount
House, residence of Mrs. Guy Makin, North
Adelaide, many people brought parties, and
these included naval officers. The Rear-
Admiral attended after dinner at the Adelaide
Club. The majority of the guests sat on the
lawn and enjoyed the programme provided by
Toe H. Others danced in the ballroom. Supper
was served in the house. The effort was in
aid of the District Nurses. Mrs. Guy Makin
wore a black chiffon toilette, and her niece,
Mrs. E. E. Colquhoun, was in a cream-ribbed
silk, relieved with emerald green. White pre-
dominated in the frocking and pearl and
diamente tiaras were prolific.
The University Wives’ Club gave a farewell
tea for Lady Hore-Ruthven in the Lady Symon
Hall. There were pink roses in crystal bowls
on the tea table, and mixed flowers round the
room. The president (Mrs. A. E. V. Richard-
son) was gowned in pale-pink linen lace, with
a large white straw hat. The guest of honor
chose pink georgette patterned in red, and her
beige straw hat was banded with the same
material. The attendance included Miss Murray
(patroness of the club and sister of Chancellor
George Murray).
A budget from Perth:
The R. Goyne Millers’ terraced garden pro-
vided an ideal stage setting for their open-air
play “One Summer’s Day.” The auditorium,
where 350 guests were seated, was bordered
with flowerbeds, shrubs and a windscreen of
tall trees; the footlights, nestled in a riot of
growing blooms, flashed on a rural scene, with
haystacks, rushes and a punt propelled along
a willow-banked stream at the back. In the
last act floodlights revealed a country-house
garden, with wistaria-entwined porch, gaily
creepered trellis and festoons of colored lan-
terns swinging between the trees. Verna Miller
made her bow to the audience girt first with
floral linen and later in a dainty frilled affair
of spotted pink net; Mrs. Miller produced the
piece, played a part and brought her becoming
grey wig and sequin-caped black velvets to
sup with the guests.
Cottesloe Golf Club members trekked to
and from the marquee erected on the putting
green and the club dance-room, where huge
tubs of maidenhair fern lent a winter-garden
effect at the opening-of-the-season hop. Presi-
dent Wingrove and Captain Jacoby extended
welcoming hands, and then led off the revels
with their better halves. Mrs. Wingrove trod
a measure in a combination of black marocain
and ring velvet; Mrs. Jacoby’s sheathlike
floral ninons were traced with mimosa-green;
Mrs. Walter Saw flung an Elizabethan ruff
over her autumn-tinted chiffons; Hetty Forbes’s
shimmery satins gleamed bright gold; Mrs.
Meachen’s streamlines were flower-splashed, and
Mrs. S. H. D. Rowe hung caped sleeves on her
Burgundy georgettes.
Magistrate Horgan’s pretty daughter Nessie
clasped a wisp of satin-edged tulle to her
brunette curls with three “Alice in Wonderland”
rows of pearls, grasped a shower of roses, car-
nations and gladioli, and set off for -St.
Andrew’s, where Austin Lambert waited with
a ring. Rich ivory lace clung to the wrist
and knees, where, from a deep ruffle, emerged
a swirl of satin frothing round to form a lace-
inlet train. ’Maid Jean Wingrove’s white pan-
cake ballibuntal topped nymphlike green chif-
fons falling into cascades of frills leashed with
a silver waist bow. Her pink and mauve
flowers were carried along to after-rejoicings
at the Karrakatta Club, where Mrs. Horgan’s
embroidered nut-brown marocains revealed
inlets of mushroom georgette.
L.A.B. Music Club members rallied in force
for the opening at-home at the Karrakatta
Club. _ President Mrs. Mason and secretary
Marjorie Southwood smiled greetings and wel-
comed the new vice-president, Dr. Crisp.
Madame Madalah Masson, swathed in lapis
lazuli georgettes, and Mona Nugent, whose
oyster silks were pimpernel-flowered, were
lions who lent an ear to the musical pro-
gramme and a tooth to the delectable supper.
May Oakley is winding up her days of single
bliss with a round of gaieties. Mary Burt,
nautical in navy and white, gave a luncheon at
Pierre’s; the Sinclair McGibbons handed
around teacups at their Bellevue Terrace home,
and Joyce Burridge marshalled troops at Toby’s
Kitchen.
Floodwaters caused an upheaval in the com-
ings and goings of country visitors to the city.
The newly-wed Kim Males set off for their
home in Broome, but were stranded en route
at Geraldton; Bill Broun ploughed through
to Perth to take his wife back to Beverley, but
had to wait for several days; and Betty Spark,
after a vain endeavor to communicate with her
family at York, took a devious route through
Northam.
Mrs. C. P. Smith, set about with white-
ringed navy foulard, put on a luncheon party
at the Karrakatta Club during the Otranto’s
few hours’ berthing at Fremantle. Mrs. Bail-
lieu and Miss B. Baillieu, of Melbourne, who
are en route for a holiday in England, and
Mrs. D. Kilburn, who has just spent twelve
months in Australia, were the guests of honor.
A spot from the Speck;
Quite like an old-time affair in size and
style was the ball at Government House which
wound up our brief social season. The lovely
old house lends itself so well to hospitality and
has been wasting its sweetness so long that it
was good to see it once more full of life. The
ballroom was crowded, and naval and military
uniforms vied in piquancy of hue with the
women’s frocks. Bridge was played upstairs
by the older folk, but most of the guests pre-
ferred to dance or to look on in the ballroom.
Lady Clark wore her favorite lace, matched
with georgette in soft blue. Twenty-three debs,
(in the Court sense; they “came out” earlier
in the season) curtsied to the Governor and his
lady. A warm night (our share of the great
heat-wave) made the old garden a pleasant
place for sitting out.
Launceston Grammar School rose to its full
stature 'on Old Boys’ Day. H. C. Abbott’s
gift, a beautiful new edition of the school flag,
in all its glory of red, gold and blue, flew from
the flagstaff. The new chapel—not quite fin-
ished —was crowded all the afternoon. It has
dignity, and will mellow as its newness is worn
off. Stones from Eton, Harrow, Winchester,
Merchant Taylors’ and other English public
schools are set high in the walls, and the
carved altar is the gift of a former head, H.
Gillett. Dinner in the big dining-hall was cere-
monial, and telegrams were read from old
boys now domiciled in many foreign parts.
Child Welfare supporters have put their backs
into the job of raising funds, and the shows
they organised have been well supported. The
street collection gave a fatter return than usual,
and a children’s fancy-dress party in the City
Hall brought many doubloons into the treasure
chest.
The R.A.N. Squadron had a very short stay.
A ball, given by Rear-Admiral Dalglish, captains
and officers, was staged on the broad white
decks of the Canberra, and was a gay affair.
The quarter-deck was given over to dancing,
and most of the decorations were in a scheme
of red and green—gaudy but very effective
under colored lights with a background of
battleship grey. Guests ate their food for-
ward of the dancing space. His Ex. and Lady
Clark were there, she in a lace frock of deep-
prune color. The night was fine and the har-
bor a picture, with gleaming lights reflected in
the still water.
Newnham races in the north were blessed
by heavenly weather, which should have
brought out more racegoers than it did, but
perhaps they didn’t trust it. Frocking was
almost entirely summery; women’s last flutter
in diaphanous fabrics, for after March cpmes
dull autumn. In the throng were Dr. and Mrs.
Geo. Clemons, the Guy Merediths, the Geoff
Grubbs, the Andrew Raeburns, Mr. Tulloch
Scott, the H. P. Ritchies, the A. E. Peppers,
Mr. and Mrs. Carl Stackhouse, the H. P. Har-
rissons, the V. C. Halls, Peggy Mclntyre and
the Noel Browns.
Sheila Maxwell had a great send-off when
she sailed in the Mooltan for the Cold Coun-
try. She will spend most of her time there
with her aunt, Lady Abinger, in Scotland.
Lady Clark opened the new lounge at the
Victoria Convalescent Home at Lindisfarne, and
many philanthropic folk went across to sup-
port the fair which backgrounded the cere-
mony. The lounge for male patients is a big,
airy, well-lit room, nicely panelled, and the
means to build it came from a legacy under the
will of Mrs. E. J. Greene.
The Aerial Pageant in the south was rounded
off, as in Launceston, by a ball. The Con-
tinental was decorated with appropriate designs
and gadgets. Lady Clark presented the trophies
won by competitors during the day. The
northern president, Dr. Ramsay, was there,
and air-mmded folk from all around Hobart
helped to make the jollo memorable.

The Good Turn.
BY J. H. SCHMEIDER.
JACKY was worried. With his back
against a fence-post supporting two
barbed wires, he sat on the ground,
his legs stretched out before him.
An undersized aboriginal scarcely out
of his teens, he looked a comical figure
as he sat meditatively puffing away at
a short-stemmed clay pipe, his skinny legs
encased in a pair of worse-for-wear pink
bloomers, his upper nakedness covered
by a woman’s well-worn nightdress —
cast-off clothing that a farmer with a
perverted sense of humor had given him.
Jacky’s black eyes weie fixed specu-
latively on a number of geese and half-
grown goslings regarding him uneasily
from a small water-filled melonhole in
the short-grassed paddock forty or fifty
yards away. Over and over again he had
counted them, according to his system of
arithmetic —thirty-seven goslings and
seven adult geese. Jacky had had no ex-
perience with geese; in fact, he had
never seen one until he discovered this
flock three days before.
His experience in the poultry line
had been wifh ducks—big, white, sleek
Muscovy ducks. He knew all about them.
Time and again he had caught ducks
in that very melonhole and sold them
to the big, fat German storekeeper up
the road a bit to the right, or to the
little, smiling Jewish storekeeper down the
road a bit to the left. And he had sold
the same batch of ducks, six in all, more
times than he could remember, because
the stupid birds persisted in returning
home directly the storekeepers had let
them out into the yard to exercise. Good
fliers, it was sheer joy for the Muscovies
to clear the sft. paling fence and with
whistling wings return to their rightful
quarters. .With their yards nearly always
full and one duck much the same as an-
other, the storekeepers, who marketed
their livestock but once a week, had never
noticed their disappearance.
Time and again Jacky had got drunk
at the little pub at the corner on the
proceeds. Sixpence was all he got for a
bird ; but the publican’s rum possessed
an extraordinary kick. The ducks were
not back at the melonhole when he
sobered up after the last spree.
For three weeks he had hung about,
hoping against hope that they would
return; then had gone on a walkabout
which had lasted almost six months. In
all that dreary time he had enjoyed only
one nip, drained from a nearly-empty
brandy bottle dropped by a bullock-
driver. He must have another spree.
For days he had rambled the district
on a vain quest. As a last resource, he
had revisited the scene of his former de-
predations, thinking that by some miracle
the ducks might have returned. Instead,
he found the melonhole occupied by
white geese.
Jacky couldn’t understand them. Each
time he had approached to view them
from close quarters, four of the old birds
had come running to meet him, necks
outstretched, heads held low, making
strange and unfriendly noises. The ducks
hadn’t behaved in that fashion. Morning
and afternoon for the last three days he
had visited the melonhole, waiting for the
geese to come down to paddle, or, if they
were already there, watching them as they
fed and paddled about, eyeing him sus-
piciously. In the meantime he had made
casual inquiry at the storekeepers’ as to
whether they would buy “big pfeller
w’ite duck, aller same Muscovy, but
plenty pfeller bigger.” They would.
Meditatively he sat sucking at the
stumpy clay, turning over various schemes
in his mind. He wasn’t going to be greedy.
Two birds at a time would do him. At
that modest rate of going they would last
him a long time, even if none should
come back. He had provided himself
with several lengths of strong string to
tie the birds, carried for convenience
wound around his ankles. All that he
needed now was a plan of action.
In silence he smoked on. After a while
his eyes, fixed on the wading geese, sud-
denly brightened.
“Too many little pfeller duck alto-
gether,” he soliloquised. “Poor big pfeller
duck can’t swim at all.”
There was justification for this kindly
viewpoint, for the adult geese had to
content themselves with walking round
the muddy rim of the melonhole, while
the thirty-seven goslings dived and bogied
in unrestrained ecstasy in the limited
water area.
“Too many little pfeller duck alto-
gether,” he repeated. “Have to catchum
little pfeller duck an] sell ’im. Poor big
pfeller duck can swim den. Do ’im a
good turn.”
Knocking the ashes from his pipe he
tucked it under his baby bonnet, and
rose with alacrity to his feet. Dodging
beneath the fence, he crossed the road,
climbed a hfgh paling fence and disap-
peared into a field of ripening maize.
Presently he returned with a large cob,
from which he stripped the husk as he
walked along.
For a moment he stood undecided;
then, wrenching a handful of grain from
the cob, he walked cautiously towards
the geese, the twine, for greater conveni-
ence, carried loosely wound round his
neck. Hissing angrily, the seven full-
grown geese advanced to meet him, the
four ganders well in the lead.
“Duck, duck, duck,” Jacky called in-
vitingly, throwing a grain of corn. “Come
on. I bin gib you corn. Come on, duck,
duck, duck.” The geese came, the gan-
ders stretching their necks to their full
extent and hissing more loudly than ever.
But Jacky was unafraid. “He got no
tooth. He can’t bite,” he reassured him-
self. “Come on, duck. I bin gib you
corn,” he coaxed ; “duck, duck, duck.
But the ganders continued to hiss,
although they had ceased to advance.
“Silly cow! Wot name you yabber?”
Jacky scolded. “No savvy dat one at
all. You gettum sore t’roat you sing out
like dat. Me only wanter catchum little
pfeller piccaninny. Do you a good turn.
The ganders, hissing viciously, kept
backing until they were right up against
the goslings, which had left the water and
started to follow after their parents.
“By cripes, you bin breakum neck
yet, you stretch ’im all de time like dat!
Jacky warned. “Here, you eatum corn,
and he threw them a handful of grain.
The golden grain momentarily dis-
tracted their attention, and when the
goslings ran forward and greedily
gathered it up the ganders hissed with
less savageness. Encouraged, Jacky threw
another handful of grain, moving cau-
tiously closer and closer.
Removing the last handful from the
cob, he called “Duck, duck,” invit-
ingly, and scattered the corn at his feet.
Then, as the goslings tumbled over
each other to get at it, he made his grab.
Had he been content with two birds,
he might have got clear away. But he
suddenly thought he could .comfortably
carry three. With the terrified, shrieking
goslings in his arms, he was struggling
to regain his feet when the ganders
charged.
They flew at him, tearing his clothes
and whipping him unmercifully with
their powerful wings. Alarmed, Jacky
scrambled to his feet, and, still holding
fast to his screaming captives, sought to
beat a hurried retreat. But the enraged
ganders came at him again. Shrieking
in their fury, they buffeted him right and
left. One grabbed him by an ear, wrench-
ing at the organ until it was nearly torn
from his head. Another got him by the
cheek, lacerating his face until the blood
trickled from his chin. When a third
seized him by the nose Jacky dropped the
goslings and sought to defend himself.
“Leggo, you silly cow!” he begged,
striking desperately about him. ‘ Leggo.
You bin breakit nose yet, you don’t look
out. You make ’im bleed already.”
But the ganders only redoubled their
efforts. Feathers flew in all direc-
tions, and Jacky’s bonnet, pipe, tobacco
and matches were swept from his
wilderness of matted hair. Bloomei s
and nightdress were soon hanging in rib-
bons. One gander got hold of the string
encircling Jacky’s neck and drew it chok-
ingly tight. Jacky gasped for breath as
he made blindly for the road, protecting
his bleeding face with his hands.
“Hey, you pfeller,” he pleaded patheti-
cally, “gibbit fair go. Me no hurt you.
Me only wanter catchum little
piccaninny; do you a good turn. But
the ganders didn’t seem to understand.
The mother geese encouraged them
with shrill cries. Tearing at the stran-
gling circles of twine, Jacky worked them
loose, and, breathing freely again, quick-
ened his pace. The pursuing ganders
also quickened theirs again.
“Me goin’ now,” Jacky told them need-
lessly. “Me no wantum piccaninny. Me
only gammon.” But the ganders were
not gammoning. Right out on to the road
and half-way down to the corner store
they followed, whipping him with their
wings from time to time, and pinching
him painfully with their tip-hooked beaks.
Then with shrill cries they flew back to
their waiting wives and family.
Far down the road Jacky stood rue-
fully viewing his wrecked garments and
wiping the blood from his lacerated neck,
nose and face. .
“You silly, big w’ite duck,” he cried
resentfully, shaking his fist at the vic-
torious band —“you wait till I do you a
good turn again!” Then disconsolate 1>
he walked down the road.

A Night’s Entertainment.
BY FRANK DALBY DAVISON.
FOR a year or so, some years back,
I was mates with six feet of good
nature named Tom Linklater. As
well as possessing agreeable human
qualities, Tom was a man of parts.
We were in Gippsland, swagging it
through the ranges from Cassilis to
Bairnsdale. At sundown on the last full
day of our journey, we made camp on a
grassy little flat alongside a creek.
There was a man camped alone at the
other end of the flat. He looked like
a city man.
“A spieler,” suggested Tom. “Probably
dodging the police.”
I noticed the stranger staring hard at
us. “He’ll come over later to size us up,”
I hazarded.
He did. We had finished tea and were
sprawled, smoking, by the fire, when he
approached out of the darkness, looking
inquisitively first at Tom and then at
me.
“G’night.”
“G’night.”
“Goin’ fur?”
I told him that we were looking for
work and had hopes of getting some-
thing in Bairnsdale.
He looked at the bulk of our swags,
the shape of our hands, the growth of
our beards ; sized us up for a couple of
out-and-out bushies ; sat down by the fire
and proceeded to entertain himself by
telling us lies.
He came from Sydney originally, he
said, but had knocked about a bit. While
he talked I had a good look at him. He
was short and slightly built, and had a
paunch like a little pudding basin. He
had wavy, black hair, and there was a
faint scar extending from his right eye
toward his ear.
He’d “been in the racing game.” He
mentioned owners and jockeys with
whom he was on familiar terms. His
discourse was full of such expressions
as “I said to him, Harry” and “He
says to me, Stan, he says”
He told us how he and one or two
others had pulled off a coup with a horse
owned by a friend of his that was being
raced into form. They got at the jock.
Backed the nag s.p. in small amounts
all over the city ; and it “romped home.”
“Did you say that the owner was a
friend of yours?” asked Tom.
“Well, not exactly a friend,” said the
spieler, hastening to alter the tint of his
narrative. “Just a bloke I knew. ’S’matter
of fact I had a grudge agin the cow!”
He paused a moment. “We cleaned up
a cool five hundred each,” he said.
“Done it all in, though,” he added.
“Thought you must have,” I mur-
mured.
He caught sight of the cover of a well-
known weekly peeping out of my swag.
It appeared that he did a bit of press-
work occasionally. There’d been a little
thing of his “in that paper you got there”
—a sketch of Sydney life over the pen-
name “Kirribilli.” Perhaps I’d noticed
it?
I saw the corners of Tom’s mouth
twitch, “Kirribilli” was my pen-name ;
and a cheque in payment for that sketch
was at that moment in my swag.
That spieler was a most unlucky liar!
He swung off into politics. He’d dabbled
a bit in local affairs. You didn’t see
his name in the papers ; but at almost
any election there’d be candidates bid-
ding for his services as campaign secre-
tary.
But politics was a dirty business. He
expressed his opinion of it by twisting
up his mouth, putting a hand, palm out-
wards, before his face, and turning away
his head. Crook? Crook was no name for
it! He mentioned the name of a Cabinet
Minister. Even he was “shady! A
bit of graft here and a bit of graft
there; working his mug relatives into
soft jobs was the least of it!”
Tom’s face was worth watching ; the
Minister was his brother-in-law!
The stranger got on the subject of girls.
His treatment of it was what- might be
expected of him. As he proceeded with
his story I saw Tom’s eyes beginning to
snap.
Tom had nice ideas about women.
I won’t tell you the spieler’s yarn;
you wouldn’t enjoy it. It had to do with
a particularly callous betrayal of a par-
ticularly trusting sort of girl. The girl,
judging by his description of her, was
not the kind to fall for a man like him ;
she was more like Tom’s kind. I didn’t
believe the yarn ; but something about
the gloating way he told it made you
want to kick the little hound for thinking
of it.
Tom had been drawing lines along the
ground with a chip while the spieler
was talking; at the finish he looked up.
“There was a man came between
me and a girl I was shook on, once,” he
said.
“Aw?” said the spieler.
“Yes,” said Tom slowly. “You said
that what you were telling us about
happened in Newtown, didn’t it?”
“Yes.”
Tom nodded his head. “This happened
in the same place,” he said.
“Go on!”
“Yes. The fellow was a dirty little
racing tout.”
“Go on!” The spieler shot a quick
look at me from the corner of his eye.
“Yes. A chap with ?, scar on the side
of his head.”
“That’s funny!”
“What’s funny about it?” Tom barked,
looking hard at the spieler.
I looked from one to the other. It
struck me that we’d had enough coinci-'
dences for one evening.
Tom drew some more lines' on the
ground. When he spoke again it seemed
to me that he was telling more than he
had at first intended; as if he were
caught up in the flow of his own story.
“This girl,” he said, “like the one you
told of, lived with her mother, and earned
a living for them both with her sewing-
machine. Their place was in a dusty
little side street.”
He paused as if to bring details to
memory. “It had a bit of board with the
word ‘Dressmaker’ painted on it, tied
with a piece of wire to the verandah
post.
“I used to pass along that street every
day, going to and from work. I’d occa-
sionally seen a man going in or coming
out of it.”
A brighter look came into the spieler’s
eyes. Tom didn’t appear to notice that.
He went on making marks on the ground
with his chip. He was drawing over-
lapping squares.
“Another thing I’d noticed was the
old lady who lived there. When I passed
of a morning, she’d be out in front, rub-
bing up the knocker, sweeping the veran-
dah, or pouring a dipper of water into
the asparagus fern. She was a little
woman, with a stoopy back and a bright,
interested-looking face.
“One evening I noticed a ticket with
the word ‘Vacancy’ on it in the window
I went on, half-way up the street, and
then turned back. I wasn’t comfortable
in the place where I was staying.
“The old lady answered the door.
“ ‘You’ve got a room to let,’ I said,
raising my hat.
“ ‘Yes, sir,’ she said. ‘With board and
washing. Would you like to see it?’
“I said I would.
“ ‘Just come this way, sir.’
“I followed her down the passage.
Her head was about as high as the
middle button of my waistcoat. There
was a nice, homy smell about the place
and I saw a neat bit of garden through
the open back door.
“She showed me into a clean little
room with an iron bedstead, a dressing-
table and a chest-of-drawers. I said it
would do, without bothering to look at
it much. I reckoned I’d be comfort-
able enough—as soon as she stopped
calling me ‘sir.’ It was arranged that
I should move in at the week-end.”
Tom shifted on to his other elbow and
took the chip in his other hand. He
glanced once at me, as if to make sure I
was listening. He seemed to have for-
gotten about the spieler.
“I’d heard the whirring of a machine
behind a closed door ; but I didn't meet
the daughter until I moved in the follow-
ing Saturday night. She was a tall thin
girl, with a pallid skin and straight, black
hair. At least, that’s how she struck me
at first. It wasn’t until I’d been in
the house a few days, and had observed
her a bit, that I realised that she was
good-looking in a strange way.
“Her manner was a bit stand-offish,
it seemed to me. Polite but without
warmth. Then I worked it out that
there’d been a succession of men through
that house and that she’d evolved a set
of manners to cope with them. I think
she was extra-starchy with me on account
of her mother being extra-friendly. She
didn’t want me to think Well,
women have their own way of being
proud.
“She lowered her guard one day, after
I’d been there about a month. It’s a
pity for her she didn’t keep it up! It
was a Sunday morning. I’d read the
paper, sitting in the sun on the edge of
the back verandah, and was titivating the
garden up for the old lady. The girl
came out and began giving me a hand.
Somehow we got on to a new footing.
By the time her mother came out to tell

Caution: To save lovely
teeth —fight film
/"\NCE this tooth sparkled in a fas-
cinating smile. To-day its place is
vacant. Film attacked it. . . covered it
with germs which slowly, steadily
destroyed it. Poor neglected molar !
No use to resist against such odds. At
last it had to be taken out.
What is film ?
Film is ever present —in every mouth —
on every tooth—constantly accumu-
lating. Sometimes it is invisible —more
often it forms a yellow, ugly mask.
Film is soft and sticky. Food par-
ticles cling to it. The mineral salts in
saliva combine with film to form hard,
irritating tartar. This makes gums
sore and causes them to bleed.
But film’s greatest damage is done
through tooth decay. In film are tiny,
rod-shaped germs . . . Lactobacilli. This
germs throws off enzymes which, in
turn, produce strong acid. This acid
eats away tooth enamel just as other
acids burn holes in cloth or wood.
Deeper and deeper goes the acid.
Bigger and bigger grows the cavity.
Finally the nerve is reached ... the root
canal infected . . . and unless repaired
in time, results may well prove tragic.
“ What can I do to fight decay Y*
Remember this : a clean tooth never
decays. To keep teeth clean and free
from film use Pepsodent instead of
ordinary tooth pastes. Why ? Because
Pepsodent contains a special film-
removing substance.
This film-removing material in Pep-
sodent is one of the great discoveries
of the day. Its power to remove every
trace of film-stain is revolutionary ! Its
notable distinction of being twice as
soft as other materials in common use
has gained wide recognition. And so,
when tempted to try cheap and ineffec-
tive tooth pastes, rememberthe one safe
way to fight film is to use the special
film-removing tooth paste —Pepsodent.

us dinner was ready we were calling
each other Jean and Tom.
“After that we got along well. We
used to go to the pictures sometimes ;
and on Sundays we would take the old
lady and go picnicking.
“They were good times. I began to
have my dreams. Jean and I could get
married, and she wouldn’t have to take
in dressmaking. Then I found myself
out of work!
“I didn’t let on. They were very in-
dustrious women, Jean with her sewing
and the old lady with her housework ; I
felt sort of ashamed at having nothing
to do. I used to go away in the morning
and come home again in the evening at
my regular times.”
Tom paused and blew a deep sigh.
“Looking for work’s a cow of a game!
And it’s worse in town than it is in the
bush—or it seems so, anyway. I had
six weeks of it before I landed a job.”
He smiled to himself. “My nerves
must have been rattled. I was so relieved
and happy to be in work again that
I told them all about it at tea that
night. Of course they were most indig-
nant with me for not letting them know
I was in trouble ; and I must never do
it again! But I thought, from a look I
caught in Jean’s eye, that I hadn’t done
myself any harm in that quarter.
“The chap I got work with was just
starting up in business. When Friday
night came he had a long, plausible tale
for me ; but no money. He’d have the
dough for me next Friday, though—two
weeks, sure as eggs!
“I hung on to a fool’s hope and stayed
with him. Of course, I couldn’t pay my
board, and I didn’t make any explana-
tions. I knew my honesty wouldn’t be
questioned ; I suppose they thought I’d
run up a pound or so of debt somewhere,
while I was out of a job. One of them
must have noticed me sucking an empty
pipe. I walked home ; one evening there
was a tin of my favorite tobacco on
the dressing-table.
“As the days wore on to Friday I got
into a bit of a sweat. Sure enough, when
the day arrived there was no money —
only a hard-luck tale.”
Tom had stopped scratching ; he was
digging, savagely. “I had to go home
and tell those two women that I couldn’t
pay them! ”
He threw the chip away.
“There’s a sort of Australian who
always turns to the bush when bad luck
lands him on the chin—l’m one of them.
I left town that night. The good old
soul didn’t want me to go. She wouldn’t
hear of it! It was like turning me into
the streets! So long as they had a roof
over their heads I She came into my
room when I was putting a few things
together and spoke to me again. Said
she felt as if her own son was leaving
the house.
“Jean understood. She said nothing.
When I was leaving she went with me, up
the little passage, to the front door. At
the moment of parting she lifted up her
face and I kissed her.”
Tom picked up another chip and
started smoothing over the earth he had
torn up. I glanced at the spieler. His
head was on one side ; he was waiting
on Tom’s words, enrapt.
“I had a rough spin.” He looked into
the darkness for a moment, and then
down at the ground again. “There were
a lot of men on the road. I’d been four
months away and had got almost to—
to the Queensland border before I struck
anything but tucker jobs.
“I landed a job on a tin-dredging
show, and the first thing I did was to
send along that two weeks’ board-money.
I sent a letter with the money-order.
| “The dredge shut down —and I was
on the road again. I didn’t write any
imore. A man doesn’t like to confess
■ failure to a woman, especially when she’s
keeping a home going. To cut a long
story short, the stiff run lasted 12 months.
I got work in a timber mill, and a week
later the market flopped. Turned my
back on the bush and went to Brisbane.
There was a tram accident waiting for
me there. I spent eight weeks in hospital,
and, exactly a year after I’d left Sydney,
I found myself on the streets again, with-
out a razoo!
“Then the luck changed. I got work,
picking up, in a shed out west. I didn’t
write. At first, because I’d lost faith in
my luck; then, when I’d got used to the
feeling of money, I felt ashamed for hav-
ing left it so long. I got one shed after
another. I was following the shearing
south and would soon be close to Sydney.
I’d drop a line, I told myself, just before
1 was ready to start for the city ; but
when the time came I didn’t even do
that.
“After all, I felt, I’d been just one of a
lot of boarders. There might have
been changes since I’d come away. I
didn’t know what to put in the letter.
I’d leave things as they were until I
could go and see them.
. “I followed the sheds right through to
the Riverina, and went to Sydney well
cashed up. I put up at a pub in the
city, bought myself a good outfit from
head to foot, and that evening I paid a
visit to Newtown.
“I got there just around tea-time. The
houses in the street seemed smaller and
more squeezed up than ever. The ‘Dress-
maker’ sign was still on the verandah-
post. I’d been away a year and ten
months. I knocked, and stood waiting
with a queer feeling in the pit of my
stomach.
“The old lady opened the door. She
stared at me for a moment, as if I was
my own ghost. ‘lt’s Mr. Linklater!’ she
said. ‘Come in!’
“I followed her down the passage —
before I’d left she’d been calling me Tom.
“When we reached the living-room I
saw that something was wrong. The little
woman was trembling all over and had
difficulty in speaking. ‘We’re in great
trouble!’ she said. She opened and shut
her mouth several times, like a fish, and
I could see that she was trying not to
cry. Then she turned and left the room.
She went up the passage and I heard
her go into Jean’s sewing-room. There
was some whispering and then Jean came
down the passage by herself.
“As soon as she appeared in the door-
way I saw what the trouble was. She
was a fine girl. The dignity with which
she came across that room was one of
the grandest things I’ve ever seen. She
gave me her hand. ‘lt’s nice to see you
again, Tom,’ she said quietly. We sat
down and talked together. By and bye
she called out to her mother, and the old
lady came back to the living-room.
“They made me stay to tea.
“After tea, Jean and I went for a walk
—choosing the worst-lighted streets.
“She took my arm, and as we walked
along she told me the story. It wasn’t
a long one. After I’d left there’d been
a procession of boarders. And then a
particularly bright lad turned up. He
was a tout or an urger, I gathered.
‘Mixed up in racecourses,’ was the way
she put it. I surmised that he was having,
or had just had, a run of luck.”
Tom cocked an eye at the spieler. The
latter winced.
“ ‘I don’t think I was in love with him,
Tom,’ she said. ‘But I was fed up with
everything—tired of endless toil and dul-
ness. He was very nice to me and
mother. I went out with him a good
number of times, and he asked me to
marry him. I said no, at first; but he
kept on and Oh, I was fed up, and at
last I said yes, and he bought me a ring.'
“The rest is an old story,” said Tom.
“He took advantage of her. When the
consequences needed to be faced he
cleared out.
“I found out during that talk just
what the thought of Jean had meant to
me during that year and ten months.
When we got back she seemed anxious
that I shouldn’t think badly of her. She
kept saying things like ‘l’d lost heart’ or
‘The future didn’t seem to hold anything
for me.’
“I knew what it was. She'd grown
weary waiting for me.” (Tom had the
chip in his hand, like a dagger, and was
stabbing and tearing at the earth. I saw
his mouth give a twitch to one side.) If
I’d written it wouldn’t have happened!
“I got her to describe that man —to the
last hair of his head. I promised myself
that if ever I met the crawler I’d flay
him alive.” (Tom’s voice fell half an
octave.) “And, by the Lord Harry, Ive
met him!”
The spieler rose to his feet as if he
had been drawn up by a string, and in
the next moment he was bounding into
darkness like a startled bandicoot, with
Tom in pursuit.
Tom returned sooner than I expected.
He came back slowly, and he took no
more notice of me than if I hadn t been
in camp. I looked at his face, but there
was nothing to be read from it and he
wasn’t the sort of man you would care
to question lightly.
He fixed up his blankets and pulled
his boots off. While he was doing it 1
got my own nap ready. He rolled into
his blankets, saying good-night to me
afterwards.
I was soon under cover myself. With
the quietening of the camp, the bush, as
it always does, seemed to come closer.
I could hear the creek singing softly
among the stones. There was the smell ot
mountain musk and the feel of green,
growing things in the dark. I had my hat
on the side of my head as a protection
against the dew; and from under the
brim I could see the stars twinkling above
the dark ranges.
I was just dozing off when a thought
came to me. I swung over and raised
myself on one elbow. Tom was lying
with his back to the falling fire, to all
appearances asleep. I was wondering
just what core of truth there was in his
story.
I had remembered his telling me once
that he’d never been north of the Murray.

THESE LAST FEW
YEARS
These last few years have, in a marked or lesser degree,
proved to all the wisdom of making some provision for the
future. All of us have experienced the unexpected financial
calls of everyday life, and, while it is impossible to gauge
accurately the needs of the future, it is possible to provide
for them.
A Savings Account costs nothing to open, and can be
opened nearly anywhere in Australia. With it and the regular
saving of money, however small the amounts, adequate pro-
vision for the unexpected calls will be made.

The Curse.
BY MARGARET FANE AND HILARY LOFTING.
rOU don’t know me?”
Y The wire-and-whalebone man at
Marty’s counter gave a general
effect of dust and work. On him the
secret guarded look, even in the ’Loo,
was out of place.
“I don’t.” Marty’s memory was chas-
ing a shadowy familiarity. “No, I can’t
place you.”
“I’m Bradley,” the man said. “Geoff
Bradley.”
Marty’s face lit up. “Well, we//—of
course! You were the quiet, steady one
—I remember! You went up-country,
didn’t you?” Marty beamed at him.
“Yairs.” Bradley stroked the right
wing of his drooping moustache, the
secret look veiling his eyes. “If you could
put me on to a room, or some place I
could board”
Young Pat Kavanagh slipped into the
shop, paused in mid-flight at sight of the
stranger, and sidled up to the counter,
staring wistfully at Marty.
“Well, Pat?”
Pat whispered urgently in Marty’s ear.
“Good-oh—good-oh, Pat.” Marty
took a tin of jam from the shelf behind
him. Pat murmured his thanks, made his
eyes twinkle, and slipped out of the shop.
“I’ll be down for some time, I expect,
and the ’Loo’s the only part I know”
“There’s the answer!” Marty nodded
towards the door. “The Kavanaghs—
they’d be glad of it. You could board
with them. I know the times are thin
with them just now.”
“Yairs?” Bradley said tonelessly.
“Yes. Denis Kavanagh” Marty
chuckled. “He thinks he’s a racing man
—always got a fortune just in front of
his nose. Irish, you know, and happy-
go-lucky. Mrs. Kavanagh’s Australian
and —but of course the main thing is
that you’d be helping them.”
“Right-oh.” Bradley seemed to grudge
the word. “Where’s the place?”
“Molly, woman” —Denis Kavanagh
dried the blue cracked plate tenderly—•
“this is a poor secret fellow.”
“Yes?” Mrs. Kavanagh wrung out
the dish-cloth. “And he’s thirty shillings
a week, too.”
“D’ye mind the cold eye he has, the
way ye’d run a mile before ye’d learn
the half of one thought of his.”
“Why should you learn it?” she asked.
Denis hung up the cups. The affec-
tionate mockery in her smile deepened
as she glanced sidelong at his fine roman-
tic head. Well, to-morrow he was at
work, after three idle, hungry weeks —
let him go on with his chatter.
“ ’Tis in me mind a great sin is on
his soul, and he no Catholic to leave it
in the confessional and be free of it.”
“So he’s on your mind now, is he?”
Denis sighed. “He is. And the poor
still face of him, hiding God knows
what.” A haunted light flickered in his
eyes. “D’ye think it would be murder?”
She laughed. “This is what it is,” she
said pointedly. “It’s thirty shillings every
week. You get your wages a fortnight
to-morrow —Mr. Bradley means that we
eat three times a day until you do get
’em.” She folded the tea-towel. “That’s
what it is. And it’s not too bad.”
“Don’t I know he’s a great blessing to
us all, woman? That’s why I can’t drive
him away. He haunts me—carrying the
burden of his crime and never a word
out of him, the poor misguided fellow.
Twenty years—twenty years since he was
here in the ’Loo, safe among his own
people.”
She thrust the evening paper at him.
“Take this,” she directed, “and that pipe
on the dresser there. Sit in your chair
for an hour with both of them. And
then go to bed.”
The hard, weary lines in Mrs. Kava-
nagh’s face became not so many. Denis
in work and Bradley an established
boarder—she even scraped the soling of
Nora’s shoes out of his second payment.
But the evening before pay-day Denis
came home, not throwing his hat across
the room and grabbing the children, but
grave and silent.
Molly, laying the table, glanced up.
“Well, Denis?”
He put his tucker-box on the dresser
and turned, still in silence.
“Well, Denis,” she repeated. “Tell me
the certainty.”
“Penny-royal,” he told her, the rapt
note, the magic of the luck, in his voice.
Donovan gave it to me. For Saturday.
It’ll be ten to one, at least.”
She sighed. “Well?” she said again.
“Mavourneen”—he came round the
table and stared into her face, his eyes
black and deep with the glory of this
certainty—“that’s not the half of it.
The pub we were in was Riordan’s
Royal”
“What of that? You always stop there
for one on your way home.”
“And coming round the corner below
I” —the cadence fell a tone, was hushed
—“I found a penny and it gleaming on
the pavement”....
“Penny-royal? That was good, Denis,”
she said softly.
“Good!” His face was alight, rapt
in the everlasting dream. “Woman,
woman,” he intoned, “I wouldn’t put it
beyond us to be driving our own car
to-morrow’s a week.”
“Our own car?” she scoffed. “On a
ten-to-one shot with a couple of pounds
to play it—have a heart!”
“You can’t tell.” He was inviolate,
safe from all gibes. “You never can
tell”
“Good-night.” From the doorway
Bradley greeted them, his face expres-
sionless, his eyes as secret as the grave.
“Tea ready? Or am I too early?”
“Ye’re on the tick,” Denis told him
heartily. “Sit down —sit down!”
Denis cocked his hat again in the mir-
ror and patted his tie. A fine-looking
fellow still, for the father of a family.
In the kitchen he paused. Molly looked
round from the sink.
“Well, you’re off,” she said. “Good
luck and”
“Don’t be bothering about getting any
tea,” he told her, “or saving the odd bits
and leavings for the children or the like
o’ that—that’s all over.” He lit his
cigarette. “I’ll bring the tea home with
me. A lobster —a couple of lobsters —
and a cold fowl. Some cake and bis-
cuits. Fruit. Some cheese. A lettuce or
two. And maybe a couple of bottles.”
“Good-oh. It’ll save me some graft.”
“And to-morrow we’ll go to the beach.”
“Got your three pounds safe?”
“I have.”
“Well, good luck, Denis.”
She turned back to the sink. Take a
rest —she could do with a rest. But it
was worth it. He’d never grow up ; that
was one thing that made it worth it.
Well, Nora had better slip round to
Marty’s and get back—they’d have
dinner-time on them before they knew
where they were....
Dinner-time did come on them, and
the afternoon, and afternoon-tea-time.
Bradley came down for a cup, as he
sometimes did.
“Boss out?” he asked. “He’s home
Saturdays, isn’t he?”
“Yes, but he’s gone to the races —going
to make a fortune,” Molly said.
“Is he?” His secret look was a sud-
den heavy veil before his eyes. “Hope
his luck’s in”
There was a clatter of footsteps on
the stairs. A boy stood in the kitchen
doorway, a scared boy.
“Well, Micky Hale,” Molly said, “you
look as if you’d seen a ghost. What’s
the trouble?”
“It’s Mr. Kavanagh, Mrs. Kavanagh
—he says to come to him at once. It’s'
life and death, he says.”
“Heavens!” She stood up. “What’s
the matter with him—is he in hospital?”
“No. Corner King and Castlereagh,”
Micky said.
“King and Castlereagh.... what’s he
there for?” Micky’s face quivered under
her scrutiny. “Is he run over —is it an
accident?” she demanded.
“Oh no, missus,” he assured her.
“Well, what is it, then?”
“I dunno.” Micky was near to tears.
“ ‘Tell her,’ ’e says, ‘to come to me here
for God’s sake, quick and lively.’ ”
She turned helplessly to Bradley. “Per-
haps he’s in a fit—it wouldn’t be drink
with Kavanagh.”
“Er—shall I come with you?” Bradley
said. “He may have had a stroke or
something”
“That’s kind,” she interrupted. “Get
your hat and we’ll nip up to the tram.”
Forlorn, desolate against a wall at the
corner of King and Castlereagh streets,
Denis clutched at her.
“Glory be to God you’re here, woman,
and me near to death”
“What’s the matter with you?” she cut
in indignantly. “You’re not ill—why
didn’t you come home? What’s the idea
of scaring the wits out of me? Why
didn’t you come home? Or are you ill?”
“No.” His pale face loomed over her.
“Home? I didn’t dare come home.”
“What’s wrong ?” she cried.

“Be gentle with me, woman dear. You
don’t understand”
“Yes, I do understand. Hasn’t a horse
loat before to-day? You got the wind
up because you couldn’t bring your cray-
fish and your bits of cake and things.”
She laughed. “I’m ashamed of you,
Denis Kavanagh! Pull yourself together
and come home to your tea. Your
horse’ll win next week, or next year.
Gome home!”
“You don’t understand,” he said again.
“I’m frightened to go home —it wouldn’t
be safe.”
Bradley opened his mouth but closed
it again in silence, while Molly stared
at her husband. Had he gone mad?
“Why wouldn’t it be safe?” she asked
gently. “No one blames you —your nag
lost and that’s the end of it.”
“Will ye look at that careering tram
and the motor-cars belting into it from
all sides” He slipped out of the
way of a plunging pedestrian and got his
back against the wall again.
“Well, will you walk home, if you’re
scared of the trams?”
“And be run over before I’m half-
way across the street? I will not.’.’
Molly sighed. “Look! Come and
have a cup of tea and tell me all about
it.”
He peered round at the sparse Satur-
day traffic. “I’ll risk it,” he said.
At the table her puzzled, anxious gaze
turned to him. “Well?”
“Penny-royal ran in the second race,”
he said desolately, “and I put me three
pounds on at tens. It came in first....
Well, there I was, with thirty-three pounds
in me pocket! It’s the day of days, I
thought, here at last! There was a little
runt of a man, and he whispering to
another by the' rail. ‘Cleo,’ says he very
soft to his cobber. ‘She can’t lose.’ I put
me whole fortune on Cleo”-
“And she came in last,” Bradley said.
“She came in first,” Denis corrected
him. “I got four to one, and I had
a hundred and sixty-five pounds”....
He sighed. “I thought I was the king of
the world. But that’s not the half of it.
I met Riley, from the works, and ‘Fili-
buster,’ says he, ‘in the last race. Both
ways.’ King of the world and me heart
in me mouth, I put the whole packet on
Filibuster for a place. Part of it on the
Leger tote and the rest (paying the money
like a swell) in the paddock.”
“And he came in last,” Molly said.
“Poor Denis!”
“He came in second,” he corrected her
sadly.
She sat up. “God bless my soul!” she
exclaimed. “Then you’ve * She
paused, staring at him.
He tapped the breast-pocket of his
tightly buttoned coat. “I have three
hundred and thirty-five pounds. God
help me, and that’s an awful thing”
Bradley laughed. “Most of us could
do with it. What a day!”
Molly could only stare in a stunned
silence.
“In a dream I stood there. I’d done
it — a t last! In a dream I came out of
the gates, a wealthy and a happy man.
The heavy sigh shook him again. “And
then I woke up. To see a phalanx of
trams, and they ripsnortin’ and rearin’
and buckin’ to tear me down and trample
on the fortune in me pocket—to see an
avalanche of motor-cars with the same
intentions.... And the. faces of the
people, every one of them only too happy
to slit me throat and rob me helpless
corpse. I crept into me tram and sat
there trembling. How could I hope to
get this great raft of money safe home
to you and the children —how could I do
it?” His hysterical eyes searched the
faces of Molly and Bradley.
“Wealth is an awful curse,” he laid it
down.
“Is it? Well, it’ll do me.” Molly had
recovered. “Think, Denis —think what
it’ll do! For the children. The bills
it’ll pay”
“Bills?” He glared at her. “You
wouldn’t use a great hatful of money
like that to pay bills, surely, woman?”
“Well, look what we can do for the
children”
“What, will you tell me?” he inquired.
“Buy them clothes —give them a
start”....
“It’s not as simple as -that, Molly
woman. I thought it out in the tram.
‘They’ll be dressed like princes,’ said I.
And then I saw the danger of that —
simple, pious children, and they driven
into a life of vanity. Til have them
taught the fine trades,’ said I —and I
saw them eating their hearts out, square
pegs in round holes because their father’s
money had pushed them there.”
“Couldn’t we buy a business, a shop?”
“Where we’d grow old glaring at each
other over the pence, and me flying at
your throat over a ha’p’orth of spilt
pepper. I tell you, Molly, it has me
beaten. We’ve been a carefree family, as
happy as kings. And now it’s all over.”
“Don't look like that, Denis!” she
cried. “Let’s give the money, away if it’s
going to do that to us.”
His seer’s eye was dark on her. “Give
it away, is it? And be certified as a
lunatic and locked behind the bars—
I tell you it has me beaten.”
Bradley cleared his throat. “Er—up
Ballarat way, I found something.”
The two troubled faces turned to him
in surprise.
“Three years ago, it was. I had to
leave it then. And that’s why I came
down to Sydney—to try to get the money
to go back and find it again.”
“Find what?” they demanded together.
Bradley peered shyly into his cup.
“Gold,” he said. “I’d done a lot of
prospecting, one way and another, for
twenty years. But this was the real
thing.”
Denis leaned forward. “Are ye saying
ye found a goldmine?” he whispered.
“Yairs,” Bradley said slowly. “The
real thing.”
“But why are ye sitting here, then”—
Denis stared at' him —“with a fortune
lying waiting for you in the earth?”
“Well, you see—l needed a bit more
money.”
“But, sure, you could have got that if
you told your story.”
“Oh, I’d have got it all right if I’d
shown me specimens—they’re up at your
place in me box. But somehow” —he
seized the teapot and poured out the
last black dregs—“well, you see, I didn’t
want any of these business sharks in it.
It’s my mine” —his eyes gleamed—“and
I’ve heard all about them.'’'
“But didn’t you know anyone who’d
be glad of the chance?” Molly asked.
“That’s what I thought of, missus,
when I came down. There were a few
chaps I’d known out there, settled round
Sydney with a bit o’ cash. But when
it came to the point I got scared.” He
stirred the cold poison in his cup. “/
know it’s all right—if I had ten thousand
I’d put it into her. But it’s different with
other people’s money.”
“Rot, man!” Denis’s eyes were alight.
“Why, a man’d jump at it! ”
“Yairs, p’r’aps he would. But what if
it went wrong? Things do go wrong
with mines, mister. Hard-working chaps
they are, and it’d be their savings.”
“And if things didn’t go wrong what
would it be worth?” Denis asked swiftly.
Bradley’s face glowed. “She’s a
beauty,” he said softly. “It’d be more
than you and I could ever count, I
reckon.”
Denis tapped his pocket and leaned
across the table. “Would ye take this
and let me in with you?” he crooned.
Bradley buried his nose in the cup,
drank the poison without flinching. “The
thought crossed me mind,” he confessed,
“when I saw the bit o’ cash was bother-
ing you.”
“Done!” Denis sprang to his feet.
“Come on then, Molly!” Afire, he
turned to Bradley.. “We’ll get a taxi
home and make him step on it, the way
we’ll look at the specimens before the
light’s all gone”
“Denis!” Molly’s voice halted him.
“How much did you win?”
“Three hundred and thirty-five —
why?”
She held out her hand. “Give me the
thirty-five. I’ll get' a few things for
the children and pay Marty on my way
back. And tell the children I’ll bring
the crayfish.”
Thrice.
Oh, once on a time, as I went a-straying,
When birds were greeting the day, newborn,
And treetops, kissed by the wind, were swaying,
I came on a fiddler, his fiddle playing,
All, all alone in the mirth of morn.
While wings went flitting through shine and
shade
And dew on the bracken glistened,
Sweet, sweet was the music that fiddler made
As there I loitered and listened.
It chanced once again—as I went a-straying
When, merged it seemed in a blissful swoon,
The trees stood dreaming, no stir betraying—
I came on that fiddler, his fiddle playing,
All, all alone in the drowsy noon.
While, blithe song raising in shine and shade,
No bird through the green ways questea,
Strange, strange was the music that fiddler made
As there, dreams dreaming, I rested.
It happened once more —as I went a-straying
When twilight moved through the woodland
way,
The gold and green of its glamor greying—
I came on that fiddler, his fiddle playing,
All, all alone at the end of day.
While daylight died with its shine and shade,
And gloom o’er the landscape darkened,
Grave ; grave was the music that fiddler made
As there, brows furrowed, I hearkened.

of the bread-winner within 20 years:
The Heritage Policy is thus the best solution
to the problem which confronts the aver-

GUARANTEE, should he not survive, an in-

his children. It offers MAXIMUM PRO-

by the resources of the Empire's Greatest
Insurance Institution, with assets to-day of
more than £263,500,000.

Heritage Policy without profits, dies two
and a half years later after paying three
premiums of £2O/10/8 . The Prudential
