RUBENS AND OTHERS
The Pelican Art and Architecture in
Belgium, 1600-1800, another massive
volume in the History of Art series, is
a much more companionable book than
the survey of Spain and Latin America
which came out a few months ago.
Partly this is because E. H. ter Kuile
manages to keep his chapters on archi-
tecture, always a difficult subject to
write about, compact and readable, as
also is his brief survey of sculpture;
but chiefly it is because of the warmth
and enthusiasm with which H. Gerson,
director of art-history at The Hague,
writes about painting—it is a very
different thing from the frozen, encyclo-
paedic studies that are so often sub-
mitted in books of this kind.
The book is everywhere dominated
by the gigantic figure of Rubens. Even
when the history of the Netherlands is
under discussion he is a prominent, if
not the principal, figure; for, as a diplo-
mat serving the Catholic monarchy of
Philip and Isabella, he played a large
part in the peacemaking negotiations
with Holland and helped to prepare the
peace between England and Spain—
“ From September, 1628, to March,
1630, Rubens was hardly at home for
more than a few days,” In sculpture,
as Dr. ter Kuile points out, his influ-
ence spread everywhere, bringing a new
opulence of figure and draperies into
the severities of church decoration; and
in art, of course, he is practically the
whole story. Dr. Gerson quotes a con-
temporary testimony to his incredible
versatility;—
“We also visited,” wrote the
Spanish doctor Otto Sperling in
1621, “the very famous and gifted
artist Rubens, whom we came upon
at his work, while he was having
Tactitus read to him and at the
same time was dictating a letter. As
we remained silent and did not wish
to disturb him by speaking, he
began himself to talk to us and went
on painting meanwhile, the reading
aloud going on also, and did not
cease to dictate the letter” It
remains a marvel that one man could
bring forth so vast and yet so fine a
body of works, and at the same time
accumulate a fortune and administer
it, give up much time to lengthy
diplomatic missions and also prove
himself an expert in classical culture,
able to engage in extensive and
thoroughgoing debates with the
scholars of his day. This extra-
ordinarily gifted man must have sub-
jected himself to great spiritual
discipline.
However, colossus though Rubens
was and ardent as is Dr. Gerson’s
admiration for him, one of the attrac-
tions of the book is that the lesser
artists are given their due apprecia-
tion. Dr. Gerson insists on Van Dyck’s
right to a high place of his own as a
painter of Court-portraits; he finds a
just and clear path through the tangle
of the three Breughels; if he sees
Jordaens almost always under the
shadow of Rubens, nevertheless he
credits him with a verve of his own;
and, at the opposite pole of art from
Rubens’s huge allegorical studies, he
speaks up warmly for the simple,
homely, intensely human studies of
peasants and villagers by Adriaen
Brouwer.
His conclusion on this whole great
flowering of Flemish art sets up an
intriguing problem for social historians
who like to relate art-history to poli-
tics; for, far from being influenced by
the troubles and disasters of their most
troubled times, it would seem that the
artists, whatever happened, just went
on painting;—
Neither revival nor decline, how-
ever, was reflected in the visual arts,
nor were they affected by the transi-
tion from Spanish to Austrian rule.
Indeed political, economic or re-
ligious troubles had few, if any
repercussions in the cultural field
Thus it cannot be denied that
the great period of Flemish art was
the time of economic decline under
foreign rule.
Small, crowded, not very clear and
all in black-and-white, the many repro-
ductions grouped at the end of the
volume are a little disappointing. With-
out color it is, in fact, impossible to
realise the exquisite freshness and
charm of Rubens’s smaller, more
deeply-felt works, such as the portraits
of Helena Fourmont, which are really
much more vital works of art than*

INFLATION AND COST
OF GOVERNMENT
A*R. HAROLD HOLT’S 1960-61
Federal Budget was not, fortun-
ately, the shocker some expected; but,
like its predecessor, it lacked any feel-
ing for the deeper problems of the
economy.
Some economists wonder whether it
was too moderate in putting on the
brakes and whether the brakes are the
right sort. With the business com-
munity the query is whether it would
not have been better to rearrange the
pattern of taxation to do away with
the burdensome payroll-tax and secure
the same revenue by less discouraging
means; to introduce new depreciation
allowances in order to avoid accelerat-
ing capital-erosion; and generally to
assist industry, where possible, to cope
with rising costs.
The spending public can feel that it
got off well in the face of rising prices
and imminent inflation in merely
having reimposed the five per cent,
taken off its tax-bill for the past year.
The company-tax increase, on the other
hand, is not by any means palatable on
top of mounting wage-rises and losses
in industries which employ Com-
munist-dominated unionists.
The main taxation addition of
nearly £4B million is represented by the
reimposition of last year’s all-round
5 p.c. tax-cut on individual incomes,
spread over the whole community
which, in any case, would be paying
more tax, and a large section a higher
rate of tax, due to margins and other
wage- and salary-increases.
Other new taxation does not amount
to much in the total.
The new policy of making the air-
transport industry pay for the cost of
airport and airway facilities will be
welcomed, especially by State railway
commissioners.
The old policy of the Government
in respect of aerodromes was neces-
sary, if air transport was to get off the
ground in a big way, but it is healthy
in more ways than one that airlines
should now be put fully on a business
basis. The cost of airports and their
maintenance has become much greater,
with the advent of modern jets, and has
created general concern about develop-
ment.
The most conventional feature about
the Budget, like that of each year’s
economic set-up everywhere, is its
expansiveness. No Budget is looked
on as a Budget in Australia in these
days unless it is bigger and wider from
the point of view of expenditure.
George Reid, during the Yes-No
campaign of 1898, remarked with awe
that the cost of Federation would
probably be £1,500.000 a year. His
ghost would have a coronary today on
discovering how much higher it is.
It reached £l3 million during the
organisation of compulsory training
before World War I and round £7O
million before World War 11. when
E. J. Ward was heard castigating the
“warmongering Menzies Government”
for its enormous outlay of £5.5 million
on defence, a sum which appeared to
prove to him and to the Communist
party that Canberra’s objective was
none other than the conquest of
Russia.
This year revenue goes to another
tecord of £1,609,000,000 and an
expenditure of £1.487.700.000. With
population growing and wages soaring
again there is no doubt but that
the trends will continue. The economy
appears to have become firmly based
on the plan of taking in our own wash-
ing in a manner that assures that infla-
tion always has one foot inside the
door.
'T'HE margins rises are reflected right
A throughout the estimates in the cost
of services and salaries, and are likely
to be reflected in taxation takings.
The Budget provides for a revenue
surplus of £125.8 million and, after
providing for redemptions and charg-
ing some loan works to revenue, a cash
surplus of £15.5 million. The Treasurer
obviously feels assured that buoyancy
will result in a lot more money in the
bag than is expected at the end of the
year.
The whole Budget, in spite of taxa-
tion increases aimed at checking infla-
tion. is built up against a background
of expanding spending.
The Budget purports to assist in
keeping down public spending, but the
civil service has at least a modified dis-
pensation and shows no sign of suffer-
ing in its own outlays the same sort
of misgivings as industry, and particu-
larly the land industries.
It does not have to speculate on the
future, as have woolgrowers, in the
light of rising production-costs due
to the margins increases, taxation
increases, shorter hours and a*
can always dip into the kitu ', 1
as the kitty is there. ’ so 1«J
The economy is scratching mwl .
some industries. But not S
service and its departments.
Such matters as that the t
for subsidies on wool product)™
being discussed are avowed 2" f
by budgeted. But that
actually advocated a few weeks bek
the issue of the estimates i n »2
every department in the Public sj
shows a proposed increase m
outlays.
The total increase in Commonwealth
revenue for the coming year represent
nearly 38 per cent, of the return £
wool sales in 1959-60.
The total budgeted-for CommoJ
wealth expenditure represents near!
five times the return from wool, 1
represents nearly a third of the whole!
of the national income as shown by fc
Treasurer.
This must be seen against the bai 1
ground of the impact of rising cosi .
production and particularly of the'a
of rising wages and salaries, as shorn
again by the Treasurer in his table.to
account for three-fifths of national ;
income.
In other words, wages and salaries
in the national income have increased,
£4OO million, or by approximately one-
seventh, between 1957-58 and 1959-1

TRIAL BY PROPAGANDA


PLAIN ENGLISH
Shadows Before
The trial of Powers, the U-2 pilot, was
more a show than a trial. His admis-
sions were so comprehensive that a trial
was scarcely needed.
If his wife, who was allowed to see
him afterwards, can be believed, he was
kept in solitary confinement during all
the time he was captive.
He was not allowed to know anything
of the world news save the Russian
version of how he had been responsible
for wrecking the Summit Conference
and world peace—a version which no
doubt influenced his attitude in the box.
He was not allowed to consult his own
lawyer or communicate with his friends.
He did not even know what defence
his lawyer would put up, and his lawyer
was a legal gentleman who has never,
within the West’s knowledge of him,
obtained an acquittal. Most of his known
clients have been shot.
Brainwashed or not, Powers smoothly
gave a lot of information which normally
he might not have been expected to give
—the route of the aircraft, how his
flight was prepared for, his specific
instructions, what unit and what com-
mander were involved and a lot more,
and he added expressions of regret for
what he had done. He behaved with
the same absurd kind of frankness that
Stalin’s victims used to exhibit in the
dock.
In fact, from Moscow’s viewpoint,
everything was perfect, and it was able
to be as suave as it liked and put on
a kind of show in which the Western
press helped it to exhibit Russian
justice as mild and kindly. The reporters
did not even burst into laughter when
caviare sandwiches were served in the
room in which the prisoner was allowed
to say goodbye to his relatives.
The emphasis throughout the trial was
on the guilt of the United States rather
than on the guilt of Powers, who has
now been taken away to an unknown
destination for his 10 years “deprivation
of liberty.” It can be taken for granted
that his homeland will never see him
again. Possibly he will announce
presently that he has abandoned the
barbarities of Western civilisation for the
loving-kindness of the U.S.S.R., or he
will just disappear, and perhaps his
family will be tempted into Russia and
disappear, too.
The silence of the U.S. Government
is a feature of events. There may be
more reasons for this than seem to exist
on the surface. One might be the fact
that the two Americans from the RB-47
fished out of the Arctic Seas will shortly
go on trial, and this will be a difficult
matter for the Soviet Union. Russia
will, this time, in effect, be on trial on
a charge of violation of international
air-space to commit murder and piracy
in the air.
Also, there is no doubt that the inter-
national situation becomes more dan-
gerous as the meeting of the West Ger-
man Assembly in Berlin on September 15
approaches, and the West will not pro-
mote argument which might give even
the shadow of a pretext for Russian
aggression.
The Kremlin is already preparing by
such measures as the assault of British
officers in occupation territory, and the
issue of a Note protesting against alleged
recruiting for the West German forces
in British-occupied Berlin in which
Berlin as a whole is referred to specifi-
cally as East German territory.
It is reported officially and otherwise
from Iraq, from other places in the
Middle East and from China that Rus-
sian technicians and industrial and
military advisers are leaving for home
—from Red China trainloads with their
wives and families are going.
There are other signs in Asia and
eastern Europe, including the timing
of the outbreaks in Laos and the moves
in Cambodia, that those who were struck
with apprehension by the sequence of
events in Russia in the past three months
—reorganisation of the military com-
mands, break over the Summit, walk-out
of Russians at Geneva, Communist
world meeting at Bucharest and the
“spy-plane” incidents —were not experi-
encing groundless fears.
This especially in view of Khrush-
chev’s positive statement of his inten-
tion to make a peace-treaty and hand
Berlin over to East Germany (which
means to himself) if the Federated
German assembly should hold its token
meeting in West Berlin next month.

Migrant Doctors
The surprising fact that Victoria is regis-
tering as many British doctors each year
as graduates from Melbourne Univer-
sity, disclosed by the Victorian secretary
of the 8.M.A., Dr. C. H. Dickson, applies
also, though to a less marked degree, in
other Australian States.
It is due to the nationalising of
medicine in Britain. The doctors are
fugitives from it.
The highest percentage of the doctors
are going to Victoria and Tasmania,
with West Australia, particularly, and
South Australia getting most of the
balance and Queensland and N.S.W.
getting fewest.
B.M.A. authorities cannot explain the
proportions other than Victoria’s pros-
perity, Tasmania’s climatic and scenic
resemblance to parts of England and, in
the case of West Australia, to medical
arrivals taking one look at Perth and
liking what they see.
The Victorian figures, which have sur-
prised even the medical profession in
Melbourne, are 87 registrations from each
quarter last year and 120 from each
in 1958.
The royal commission which investi-
gated the earnings of doctors and den-
tists in Britain last year recommended
no changes in remuneration for dentists
but raised the basic rate for a general
practitioner to £2500, with other addi-
tional awards.
This was a worth-while lift, but the
migrant doctors seem less concerned with
their earnings in Britain than
interference with their „; an . WI H

Back-room Scientist
Dr. Arthur William Turner relit
from the C.5.1.R.0. in Melbourne k

Five years ago, when the peri

animal health and production waste

not wish to be considered for the ps
so that he could continue his sti
on pleuro-pneumonia.
As a young scientist, when ft
disease was a scourge, especially
northern Victoria, he developed a n
cine which eradicated it, and his*
discovery was the world’s first effect
vaccine against pleuro-pneumonia, i
he led a scientific team in Queenslt
before the Second World War.
Dr. Turner made it clear to I

the prestige and other advantages oft

scientists had been able to mat

years, chiefly the work towards«
vaccine and diagnostic procedures. ■
earlier vaccine was most effective

Dr. Turner is making retirement,

other protesting unions don’t force the
position as they seem likely to do. As
well, the A.C.T.U. is now engaged in a
fight for the 35-hour week, which would
make it difficult for any union to get out.
The 35-hour-week campaign is, of
course, another Communist child born
in the mouth, if not of the brain, of
Comrade Parkinson, president of the
Miners’ Federation. It was received with
little enthusiasm by most workers in Mr.
Parkinson’s industry, which, from being
one of the most riotous when it was
under complete Communist control, has
become one of the most peaceful and
contented on the whole.
Its only disturbances worth notice are
those stirred-up by Communists. But
Mr. Parkinson having told the N.S.W.
Government before the last election that
the whole industry was burning for a
35-hour week, Mr. Cahill and his Mines
Minister were put under pressure and
promised to reduce the hours in State
coalmines to 37|.
Encouraged by this triumph—there
would have been a dearth of election
funds usually provided by the powerful
"OPPY'S" LIFE - STORY—
page 11.
Red unions if Mr. Cahill had not com-
plied—the A.C.T.U. went into full cry
to demand 35 hours for all workers.
It didn’t need the assurance of J. N.
Walker, president of the N.S.W. Cham-
ber of Manufacturers, to tell any sensible
person that the introduction of the 35-
hour week would be “sheer madness,”
especially since hour-standards rarely
mean what they say and there are always
means to be found for shrinking them —
the true working-time at the State Coal
Mine appears to be about 27 hours.
Mr. Walker said that last year’s
margins rises had added about 10 per
cent, to industry’s wages-bill, and the new
Commonwealth restoration of 6d. in the
£ to company-tax has added another £lB
million a year.
Already Australia is under a heavy dis-
advantage in the export trade, and local
industry at an embarrassing disadvantage
against would-be importers, through the
40-hour week and the results of 'margins
and overtime rates. And a 35-hour week,
even without constantly looming infla-
tion, would be a killer.
In Royal Canberra
[From a passer-by]
Perusal of the Estimates issued last
week illustrates the imperial thinking of
the Treasury when it comes to its own.
Canberra is easily the highest-paid city
in the British Commonwealth, even if
this advantage is offset by the fact that
it is also the city with the highest
juvenile-delinquency rate in Australia
and a birthrate round 30 per 1000, which
is about 8 per cent, above the average
of surrounding N.S.W.
Most of Canberra has a grievance just
now, the attitude towards it being more
pathetic in the upper circles of society.
It is summed-up in the poignant
sentence: “I’ve got a £5OO-rise out of
margins, but the Taxation Department is
taking most of it.” Some add another sen-
tence to the complaint: “How do they
expect a man to live?”
In point of fact, all seem to live pretty
well, if it can be called living at the
pace at which a great deal of Canberra
lives in and out of session—visiting, as
a duty, the numerous functions of the
Diplomatic Corps, riding in aeroplanes,
taking trips to the trout-rivers of the
Snowy in the weekends.
The only scenes of industrial activity
are those operated by private contractors
who are to be seen in droves tearing-up
the landscape, planting new suburbs, new
public buildings, new bridges, new park-
ing-lots and new repositories for the
new batches of New Australians, new
civil servants and visiting tourists.
It is a pity that those inquisitive tax-
payers who are often to be found lost
in the Canberra forests are not pro-
vided with a social guide to Canberra.
The Senate would be a far more in-
teresting place to any visitor who has
just sent in his returns of income if he
knew that its staff of 19 is about the
most highly-paid staff in the Common-
wealth. The average is brought down
by the fact that its 10 attendants get
an average of £lO7l a year each. But
even at that the average of the 19 is
over £lBOO p.a.
Outside the attendants the average is
£2633, ranging down from the Clerk of
the Senate, whose pay went up this vear
from £4696 to £5025.
The House of Representatives is per-
haps even more lordly in its remunera-
tion generally, but the average is cut
down by the fact that it needs 14
attendants at bottom level —about one
attendant to every nine M.Ps.
Parliament sets the standard in these
matters. And other departments follow
its opulent example. Thus last year the
Administrative Office of the Prime Minis-
ter’s Department got along with a
secretary at £6518 p.a. and eight first
assistant secretaries and assistant sec-
retaries averaging £3228 p.a. per head.
This year it has nine potentates under
this heading getting an average of £3533
a year. There is one assistant secretary
to every 12 of staff.
The 109 employed in this department
do not include the nine private secre-
taries to Parliamentary heads who are
“unclassified,” and who get an average
of £2240 p.a.
The Canberra civil service, however,
has little need to be despondent. Hope
rises on the horizon in the shape of the
new plans which envision within the next
five years the erection of a new
National Centre, new Parliament House,
new Mint, and new National Library
on the borders of the new central lakes,
new bridges, new ceremonial avenues,
Supreme Court, municipal buildings,
theatres and what-have-you on the grand
scale.

woman that if he broke the bottle it
would save a lot of time. “Not on your
life,” she said ; “there’s threepence deposit
on those bottles.” The teller gave the
bottle a crack with a heavy file, handing
her 3d. out of his own pocket. The
daddy of them all was the owner of a
seaside hotel. I forget what beer cost
in those far-off days, but coppers were
evidently no use as change, and all
pennies and halfpennies passed across the
bar were shot into a kerosene-tin under
it, to make a nice little present in time
for his daughter. Instead of getting rid
of each tin as it filled he let them build-up
until he had a battery of about seven
kerosene - tins of
coppers. Then he
sold the pub. Therp

so the lot were
stacked on a truck

There was no over-

wisely decided not
to wait while the
counting took place.
My favorite was a
celestial market-

brought in his little
lot in a bucket. He
wanted a draft on
Canton. “How much

the teller inquired.
“You count ’em,”
was the reply, ac-
companied by a
bland smile. When
the job was com-
pleted and the total
announced the celes-

“Two-tchillin more.” Rather than wade
through the lot again, the point was
conceded.

greatest assets in the years

At 15 he joined a local
cycling-club and lined-up to
start from the 6|-minute limit-
mark in his first road-race—
a 20-miler. He finished, after
dusk, among the also-rans,

The fact that he did see it

through to the finish in the
appalling conditions of that,
to him, impossible race
appealed to the older club-
members. They applauded his
effort and accepted him into
their close-knit fraternity,
which made young Opperman
decide that, even if he never
won a race, the mateship of
such generous sportsmen was
something of greater value.
From these great men of
local road-racing Opperman
learnt the meaning of team-
work. In later years he could
quickly and easily subordinate
the brilliance of his individual
performances to the team-
effort when this was needed.
At 17 Oppy chalked-up his
first win in the 10-mile
Senior Cadet Championship
of Victoria, gaining a 155.-
prize and a conviction that he
had a future as a professional
racing cyclist.
The most eventful race in
which Opperman was to ride
took place about this time.
He ran third in an 80-mile
Cycle Traders’ event. His prize
was a bicycle donated by an
up-and-coming young cycle-
manufacturer, Bruce Small,
whose own success-story has
already been featured in The
Bulletin (15/6/’6O).
On the way around to col-
lect his prize Opperman made
up his mind to sell it for the
ready cash it would bring.
Before he left, however, he
had sold Bruce Small the
bicycle on which he arrived,
and had placed an order for
a new racer Small himself was
manufacturing.
More important, he had
begun a friendship with the
man who was to become his
guide, counsellor and friend,
and who was so ably to
manage him through his years
as cycling champion.
/'Vpperman, for his part, was
casting about for a manager
who might bring him to cham-
pionship class. That he found
such a man in Bruce Small
shows in his own assessment:
“The future was to prove that
my choice of a manager was
as right as a three-lap lead
in a six-day bike-race.”
These two men were to com-
bine to lift Australian cycling
to unprecedented pre-
eminence on the racing-tracks
of the world.
Opperman joined Bruce
Small and his two brothers,
Frank and Ralph, in their
modest shop in Malvern, the
Melbourne suburb which lent
its name to the bicycle they
were manufacturing. His part
was to bring fame to the
machine the Small brothers
were trying to introduce to a
highly competitive market.
/~\n the threshold of his
w cycling greatness Opper-
man was slight and wiry.
Indeed, he bore a striking
physical resemblance to
another diminutive champion
who, in the late 1920’5, was to
astonish the world in another
arena of sport—Donald George
Bradman.
Nor did the parallel end
there. Both men were to reach
world-championship class to-
gether, dominate their respec-
tive sports for the best part
of two decades, and win great
acclaim in their own and over-
seas countries.
Opperman, older, bowed
out before Bradman, but both
retired in a blaze of glory, each
an undisputed champion of his
own sport.
Inducted into the ranks of
the professionals, Opperman
trained rigorously to Bruce
Small’s exacting schedules. In
those days there was a saying
amongst Melbourne’s sporting
journalists that Opperman’s
neighbors set their clocks by
his nightly retirements —9 p.m.
on the dot.
Almost immediately, he
began to unwind a series of
spectacular wins that stamped
him as something right out of
the box.
In three consecutive years,
dating from 1922, he won the
126-mile Launceston-Hobart
road-race in effortless manner,
on the last occasion breaking
the course record. In 1924
he won the Australasian Cham-
pionship in the Warrnambool-
Melbourne (165 miles), which,
at that time, was the most
coveted of all the Australian
road - racing classics. He
repeated the performance in
1926 and again in 1929.

POLITICAL POINTS
nPHE finding of young Graeme Thorne’s
body confirmed what most people had
already feared—that the unfortunate boy
was murdered very shortly after his dis-
appearance, the kidnappers having taken
fright at the wide publicity given to their
crime. A killing like this is the vilest
type of murder imaginable. It has none
of the mitigating circumstances of emo-
tional stress —jealousy, passion or even
hot-tempered violence. The victim means
no more to the killer than a piece of
marketable merchandise, to be discarded
and disposed of if continued possession
becomes embarrassing.
Premier Heffron has promised a
stiffer penalty for kidnapping. If he
makes it “life” he’ll have most of the
people of N. S. Wales behind him. But
kidnapping followed by murder demands
a return of the death penalty to the
Statute Book. This may be against Labor
policy, but it isn’t against the wish of
the people. A recent Gallup poll (before
the Graeme Thorne case) showed that
60 per cent, of Australians still favor
the death penalty for “brutal murder.”

Soekarno broke off diplomatic relations
with Holland and announced a “policy
of strength” in respect to New Guinea,
saying “One does not beg for one’s
rights ; one only fights for them.”

The U.N. must wish it had never heard
the beat of the Congo drums, At the
weekend Lumumba was lambasting it
because it wouldn’t help him fight
Katanga, and Moscow was rushing in to
support his demand. Russia is also
opposed to U.N. civil aid for Congo
because it will “subordinate the country
to the U.S.” Moscow didn’t feel that
way about Suez when it came to
humiliating Britain and France. Ghana’s
leader in the U.N. force complains that
the U.N. command can’t issue orders
to prevent Congolese attacking U.N.
personnel. Moscow has asked the U.N. to
end its “shameless aggression and kick
out Canadian troops . . . allies of the Bel-
gians,” but the U.N. has so far only
kicked out the faithful Ralph Bunche
in favor of an Indian. And the Abako
party of Congo’s President has announced
that it will rid the country of Lumumba
by legal or illegal means. Earlier Con-
golese troops beat-up Canadians wearing
U.N. bright-blue helmets and Radio
Congo refused to allow Bunche to broad-
cast that this was “useless and senseless
provocation.” Donnybrook sounds like
a quiet country village beside Leopold-
ville.

subverting a Ukrainian who was
“willing to sell his conscience and pride
for things with foreign labels” —to wit,
three copies of the Bible, “provocative
American books and a magazine.”
Shouting that “such activities hidden
under the mask of tourism arousfe indig-

Schultz into the outer darkness of the

A Government decision on re-equip-

to be announced soon. The Minister
for Defence, Athol Townley, now has
the report of the Scherger mission before
him. It is believed that the mission
has recommended adoption of the French
Mirage 111 jet in preference to the FI
Starfighter or the Northrop 156, botl
from the U.S. camp. The performance
of the Mirage is said to be equal to
either of the U.S. aircraft and it is only
about half the price.

At a press conference in New Delhi
Indian Prime Minister Nehru was asked
his views on Lumumba’s call for an
Afro-Asian conference. He replied:
....The tendency to imagine that when-
ever any difficult problem arises we convene
a conference, does not appeal to me. It
is a kind of extrovert tendency. When
we do not know what to do, we begin
shouting a lot, or hold conferences and
shout in unison. A conference is a very
important thing, and should be held when
the occasion arises, and after due prepara-
tion, not merely to give expressioh to
one’s anger, shall I say, or resentment at
something that has happened. That is
not enough reason. That can be expressed
singly, too. So the question is, always,
when such a conference should be held
with advantage.
Coming from a man with Nehru’s
reputation for mildness and politeness
that is equivalent to telling Lumumba
to pull his head in.

“R.R.D.”: Prince Philip’s acceptance
of the invitation to become patron of
the Australian Outward Bound Memorial
Foundation —which runs the school at
Fisherman’s Point, near Brooklyn
(N.S.W.)—is another indication of his
interest in the movement and the im-
portance he attaches to it. Not surpris-
ing—because Kurt Hahn, who with ship-
owner Laurence Holt originated the idea,
was Prince Philip’s headmaster at
Gordonstoun School in Scotland, and
the Prince has been patron of the U.K.
Outward Bound Trust for some time.
Like his famous uncle, he has plenty of
the qualities these schools seek to teach.
No half-measures ; if he takes-up a job
or a hobby he’s not content until he’s
mastered it. His advocacy of scientific
training for the young and his conse-
quent study of technicalities of nuclear-
research give one example of this activity
of mind. Of a different order, there’s
the same kind of thoroughness in the
way he has taken to polo—rare accom-
plishment in a “nautic” —and put himself

the Lieutenant-Governor, Sir Edmund
Herring, of the conferring posthumously
of a knighthood on Harry Giddy was
very surprising only because of the
timing. He had certainly earned the
honor, and its privileges will be bestowed
fully on Lady Giddy.
Throughout his life Harry Giddy
devoted considerable time to working
for scientific and charitable causes, and
the recommendation to include him in
the 1960 honors was made last year.
He died on December 13, “but the
formalities had not been completed
before his death.” Probably the for-
mality not completed was the question
asking him whether he would be pre-
pared to accept the knighthood.

“The Firm” farewells a great artist:
Harvey Adams was under the Williamson
management from when he made his first
appearance on the stage here in April, 1924,
in “Garden of Allah.” That was with Muriel
Starr, and he then played opposite her again
in “Madame X,” with a number of plays to
follow, including “Within the Law,” before
he had his really big success in “Journey’s
End.” Many theatregoers and fellow-players
remember the early part of his stay in Aus-
tralia by this performance back in 1929. After
that Harvey stayed on here, came to love
his adopted country, and played a variety of
parts before adapting himself to radio, where
his experience made him at once one of the
most popular artists in this then newer form
of entertainment.
With his quiet manner and complete lack
of self-consciousness, Harvey was always a
favorite with his fellow-artists—the attendance
at his memorial service a few weeks ago
showed how much he had endeared himself
to members of his profession. He passed
away as he always wanted to, while actively
employed in the theatre. Cast as understudy
by Cyril Ritchard for “The Pleasure of His
Company,” he died shortly alter its season

Stewart Scott Hall, Scientific Adviser
to the U.K. High Commissioner and
head of the U.K. Defence Research and
Supply Staff in Australia, was nabbed for
the above sketch before he took-off after
sick-leave in Sydney to return to his
duties in Melbourne. A founder-member
of the British Gliding Association and
an early member (15th on the list, he
thinks) of the Caterpillar Club, he did
a lot of gliding in the 1920’s at Dunstable
(Eng.) and later in Germany, when the
gliding art was being developed there.
Yarning a while at The Bulletin
office, talk veered to a discussion of the
good gliding country around Shropshire
and Montgomeryshire, and “Cody’s
Tree,” outside the old 4 Squadron
hangars at Farnborough airfield, where
War I pilot Colonel “Buffalo Bill” Cody
used to have his kite tethered until he
had revved-up the engine enough to
take-off —the stump of this tree is still
there.
Somewhere further on in the tconfab
Scott Hall admitted to being mixed-up
in the development of aircraft and, more
recently, guided-weapons. Actually,
from 1946 to 1953 he was Director-
General of Technical Development for
Aircraft in the U.K. Ministry of Supply,
(during this time he first visited Aus-
tralia) ; from 1953 to 1956 he was head
SCIENTIFIC GLIDER
of the U.K. Defence Scientific Mission
to the U.S.A. ; then he went back to
England for three years as Scientific
Adviser to the Air Ministry, coming from
there to his present job. Awarded the
C.B. in 1950, he has a string of technical
qualifications after his name, but you
wouldn’t be likely to guess it from his
modest account of the vagaries of early
flying days or his talk of his hobby,
sailing.

of many country racing-clubs.
In Sydney, at 60, Edgar Bembrick, classics-

ABORIGINALITIES
■Excavating for new foundations where
old buildings once stood can be as
fascinating as archaeology. On the site
of a long-disused foundry we dug up a
cast-iron ball approximately 9in. in
diameter. If that wasn’t a cannohball
from one of Sydney’s early defences,
I’d be interested to hear what it could
have been. A little later we uncovered
relics of a different kind of war —two
circular china lids from missing con-
tainers. One bore the legend in per-
fectly-preserved black lettering: “Joseph-
son’s Australian Ointment. N.S.W.
Sydney. For All Sores, Old Wounds,
Burns, Sunburns, Chafing, Chapped
Hands, &c. &c.” The other lid was
almost identical in size, but it pro-
“Shall I wrap it up for you, ma'am?”
claimed: “Henry’s Colonial Ointment.
Prepared Only By The Proprietor J.
Henry, Chemist, Sydney, Australia.
Cures Ulcerated Legs, Eruptions, In-
flamed Eyelids, Sore Heads &c.” The
second one sounded like the better value
for my money, even for a bloke with
no bears about the place. It also played
the patriotic note a little harder by dis-
playing as a centrepiece the Australian
coat-of-arms although the ’roo and
emu had their backs turned on each
other and didn’t appear to be playing
speaks. How things have changed!
Yesteryear advertisers attempted to boost
sales by harping on the Australian motif.
Today, if an article is good, bad or in-
different it’ll sell if it’s advertised as
imported.—“Macquarie.”
“R.A.M.”: Probably every proof-
reader has his anthology of slips caught
in time, as observed here. Struck one in
a story on bunny-control which spoke
of “the destruction wrought by rabbis.”

“H.C.8.": The number of towns in
Australia that perpetuate the surname
of a person, whether he was a v.i.p. of
his day, some village Hampden, or
merely the bloke who first settled there
or owned the pub in the original town-
ship, runs into uncountable figures ; and
often, with the passing of time, the name
has become attributed to somebody with
a similar monicker but no claim what-
soever to the honor. But there can be
no dispute over the town of Tascott,
near Gosford (N.S.W.). It even in-
corporates both initials of the man whose
name it bears —T. A. Scott, claimed
locally to have been the first man to
grow sugarcane in the district. Possibly

“Sevenelms”: Nevil Shute deservedly
impressed readers with his use of Aus-
tralian local color, but in On The Beach
Moira took Dwight for a drive in a four-
wheeled Abbot buggy and she called it
a jinker, a term which surely in Aussie
parlance was restricted to a two-wheeler.
Etymologically, a jink is a nimble motion
and in jinkers this was exaggerate/;

jinkers were of two wheels, axled by an

“Siosal”: Bird-students would be very
interested if it could be proved as
claimed by a “Sydney Morning Herald”
writer, that the wandering-albatross has
a wing-spread “up to 14ft.” In fact, a
spread up to 12ft. is extremely rare, and
of more than 100 birds measured on
the N.S.W. South Coast in recent years
none exceeded lift. The “Herald”writer
was also astray in his references to tie
albatross which in 1887 (not 1877)«
banded by castaways on the Crozet
Islands and recovered near Fremantle
(W.A.). That bird, with its inscribed
tin-collar appealing for aid, was released
on August 4 and recovered on September
18, so that its long journey (at least
3500 miles) occupied much more than
the fortnight claimed for it. Moreover,
the castaways were not found dead by a
rescuing party ; they had, as a note left
behind intimated, started off for another
island, but apparently they were lostoi
the journey.

that she probably wanted the babe to
have its father’s name; but Venus
sneered: “What about the two she has
out on her Island! She has given them
their father’s name, but she didn't marry
him then.” Although Peta had two
children by Albert he was not of the

half-another-Island that was an enemy
of hers, and the girl’s parents had for-
bidden their marriage. Apparently Peta

“Derwent”: Tas-
mania’s Animals
and Birds Protection
Board is perturbed
about Cape Barren
geese, whose num-
bers have decreased
so alarmingly over
the past few years
that it’s feared the
bird may disappear
altogether. Illegal
shooting, vandalistic
egg - breaking and
the taking of goslings
are largely respon-
sible. This goose,
one of the rarer Aus-
tralian water-birds,
has as its main home
Tasmania’s north-
eastern islands of
the Furneaux
Group, although it
also lives on islands'
off the South Aus-
tralian coast.
Brownish-grey, with
a black bill, dark spots on the wings,
pinkish legs, webbed toes and a black
streak up the front of the leg,
it makes good eating. When the board
began its count in 1957 some 2000 of the
birds were marked present: now less
than half have answered the roll-call.
In some instances there has been
deliberate smashing of eggs because
farmers claim the geese foul the pastures.
Proposed saving - measures include
making one of the Furneaux islands a
special sanctuary.

shown somehow to be the same bird
each day, following H.M.S. York for
four days and covering 1700 miles. I’ll
pay that. One of them followed a ship
I was on for several days, and the
assumption was that the bird remained
in the air all the time, or took only brief
spells resting in the drink. But three
nights running I saw the bird perched
on our rigging, and it stayed there for
hours at a stretch. That’s how I reasoned
it was the same bird.

THE 1960-61 BUDGET
Although, charging all de-
fence expenditure to
revenue, the 1959-60 Budget
was designed to balance
exactly, in the end revenue for
the past year was so buoyant
that even with expenditure
above estimates, the net result
was a surplus of £29 million.
Treasurer Holt, in his
1959-60 estimates, which
, allowed for a personal income-
tax cut of 5 p.c., budgeted on
bigger business, and results
amply justified his expecta-
tions. There were higher per-
sonal incomes, greater con-
sumer-spending and increased
imports.
Bigger business still goes on,
but the emphasis is on internal
(often “boom”) activity at
present, with the export posi-
tion not as strong as it was.
The increasing costs of pro-
duction which followed vari-
ous rises in arbitration-court
wages in 1959 have had a most
disturbing effect on the situa-
tion in the circumstances.
After various observers had
sounded the alarm late in 1959
they Federal Government in
February intervened in the
basic-wage proceedings, lifted
import-licensing, approved the
central bank’s action in check-
ing an increase in liquidity in
the banking system and
announced that it would do all
in its power to avoid deficit-
finance in 1960-61.
In introducing his 1960-61
Budget on August 16 Treasurer
Holt expressed awareness that
the effect of margins and other
wage-rises would take some
time to make their full infla-
tionary effect felt, and that
official resistance to forces
throwing the economy out of
balance was necessary. Econo-
mically, a strong upthrust of
activity is still under way, he
said, and the building industry
(always a pointer) was achiev-
ing new records.
Shortages of key materials
and some classes of labor have
reappeared, indicating that, in
various directions, we are over-
reaching our resources There
is excessive demand for Im-
dang<;r q( dissi _
pating our overseas reserves in
feeding a domestic boom,
Alsoj said Mr Holt , « specu
don j n shares and other
securities and in land is dis-
turbingly active and prevalent.”
Boisterous Speculation
The first seven months of
i 960 were indeed boisterous in
speculative activity. One
stimulant was the tendency for
some company boards to
encourage higher market
premiums on their shares
either for the purpose of assist-
ing takeovers or resisting same.
And the land gamble really
boiled-over.
The Budgetary action of the
Government to counter the
booming unbalance in the
economy is mostly concen-
trated in an increase of 6d. in
the £ (to Bs. in the £) in the
■ . c

Allowing for the increased
income-taxes, minor adjust-
ments to sales-tax and excise,
and for a full year of the new
increased postal charges, total
revenue for the current year
(£1609.5 million) is estimated
£177.7 million higher than for
the preceding period:

Of this increase in revenue,
£96.5 million more this year
(in all, £125.8 million) will be
available as a Budget surplus
to provide for public works
and restrain inflation. The
Commonwealth Government
itself, if it does no more than
match its Budget estimates, will
have achieved very few
economies itself. The drop in
miscellaneous expenditure is
due to the fact that there is
no contribution to the Inter-
national Monetary Fund this
year (£ll.B million last time),
although there will be provi-
sion of £2 million to meet
Australia’s initial subscription
to the International Develop-
ment Association.
Departmental expenditure is
tipped to rise by £3.8 million
(to £79.3 million) during
1960-61, with one less payday.
Increased margins account for
£2 million of the estimated rise.

Aust. Portland* Cement
XII7HEN the new units at Gee-
’ long (Vic.) and Kandos
(N.S.W.) are completed, Aus-
tralian Portland Cement Pty.
will have a total plant-capacity
of 1,200,000 tons of cement a
year. This will apparently be
800,000 tons at Geelong and
400,000 tons at Kandos. The
management says it cannot at
present visualise a falling-off in
demand.
The great strength of A.P.C.
is its Geelong plant, which, in
spite of recent enlargements,
has been unable to cope with
demand. The big expansion in
capacity over the past few
years has been financed largely
out of profit plough-back. Only
£565,000 has been raised by
new issues in the same time.
It represented a one-for-five
issue by each of the holding-
cos. —Australian Cement, Ltd.,
and Kandos Cement, Ltd..
Bonus-issues in 1956 almost
doubled the capitals of the
holding-cos. (in which the pub-
lic is interested), but capitalisa-
tion per ton of plant-capacity
is still very low. If there is no
further increase in capital be-
fore present plant-expansion is
completed, holding-co. capital
per ton of capacity will still be
under £2.

seems to be outstanding.
Linoleum Holdings
■pviRECTORS of Linoleum
Holdings, Ltd., have
advised shareholders not to
part with their shares —“cer-
tain negotiations are pending
which could possibly be of
benefit to shareholders.”
Whether the negotiations are
with the Michael Nairn
interests (Lino Holdings has
a 21.3 p.c. interest in the Aus-
tralian Michael Nairn Co.)
isn’t clear, but they could
possibly be.
Lino Holdings shares have
been recommended here at
under 30s. a share on several
occasions. Recently they have
mounted to 525. 6d.
Michael Nairn (Aust.) has
the strongest grip on linoleum-
manufacturing of any co. in
Australia, and it also makes
synthetic floor-tiles. It has
extremely solid backing for its
shares, and its earning-power,
on average, has been high,
even on estimates that are
apparently conservative.
Aluminium
[From “Old Opencut”]
TUHy the delay in developing
the bauxite deposits at
Weipa?
It is four years since the
value of the vast ore-sites was
evaluated, and though there is
a global oversupply of metal,
a huge market for bauxite
would switch to Australia
overnight—given the oppor-
tunity.
The overseas position has
changed to a degree, making
any development of additional
ingot production, other than at
Bell Bay, now imprudent and
uneconomical.
The oversupply is due to the
expansion of the industry in
countries formerly supplied
with aluminium products from
U.K. and U.S.A.
These new sources are now
not only meeting their own ex-
panding demands but are look-
ing for trade-relations with us

primary products, ferrous basic

While there are several
reasons for delaying tactics in

for not building the minimum
field-works required to extract
tri-hydrate ore from Weipa or
Gove and ship the product to
bauxite-hungry customers over-

Comalco, the title-holders of

showing the zest for spending
the millions required for the

It could be because of the

conflicting reports of the Mana-

Ministerial statements have
been correctly recorded,
Comalco is committed to
establish a smelter near this

Comalco say they are “investi-

ilexpress themselves in
nic-and no tune on the
flploo is quite the same
thing as a symphony by Beet-
tan,
In poetry, too, the aborigines
had quite a considerable ex-
pression-more impressive per-
istal many people realise,
stc it has not yet been
altered in an anthology. The
fit of their achievement was

mysterious caves these figures
may have loomed large enough
in the aboriginal mind; but
here, isolated, detached from
the illuminating notes in the
catalogue, they are more quaint
than heroic.
The “two spirits of the
“Not bullet-holes — moths."
Geimbo country” who live in
caves and banyan-trees and
come out by day to dance
under the tree-graves, look
rather like nice long golliwogs ;
and if Nangitain, the impish
and remarkably phallic goblin
of the same locality who steals
the souls of wandering young
men, looks more impressive, he
is really about up to the
familiar wolf in “Red Riding-
hood.”
The less-ambitious paintings
range from the crudely childish
—like the boat in the “Dugong
Hunt” (No. 87) —to a much
higher average in the beautiful
shield with the snake-design in
black-and-white from the South
Australian Museum, the spiky
ant-eater, the two crabs, the
ringtailed possums, the “Fish
and Stingrays,” the “Goanna
Totem” with the stylised
goannas standing prettily on
each other’s heads, the wave-
like pattern of “The Dreaming
of the Turtle Hunter,” the
simple and effectively-spaced
“Myth of the Southern Cross”
and the ghostly “Wondjina
Figure.”
Most of them are hardly
beyond the capacities of a
talented child of 12, but there
is no doubt about their charm
on that level; and here and
there, as in “A Female Named
Manubi” (No. 18), with its
rhythmic design of undulating
arms and squatting legs and its
intricate feathery pattern, you
do get a few pieces which, like
the best of the poems, go
further.
Organised by J. A. Tuckson,
the deputy-director of the N. S.
Wales Gallery, the exhibition
is to tour all States. It should
arouse much interest wherever
it goes.
One is glad to see it in the
N. S. Wales Gallery ; and wilt
also be glad—as will the artists
now mouldering in the cellars
—when th's restless institution
has a break from travelling
shows and returns towards the
classic stability of the Louvre,
the Uffizi or the Tate. The
aboriginal exhibition is worth-
while, but the place is really
looking far too much like a
junk-shop these days.

Passmore
John Passmore’s abstract
gouaches make a colorful and
decorative show at Sydney
Macquarie Galleries. Occasion-
ally some intimations of his
favorite subject-matter of boats
and sea creep through, but
mostly they have to be accepted
just for what they are, a light
and vigorous playtime of curves
and verticals and rectangles in
patterns of blue and yellow.
On close inspection, lightly
daubed over sheets of the classi-
fied - ads. from the “Sydney
Morning Herald,” they are
shallow and distracting and it
is disconcerting to see an artist
of Passmore’s capacity show-
ing so little respect for his
materials.
Stage and Music
Harry Belafonte
The curtain rises on a stage
in pitch darkness. A sudden
blaring of brass, drums and
high-pitched strings issues from
the orchestra-pit, quickly
coming to a crescendo. A spot-
light is snapped on, revealing
in its brilliant white light a tall
dramatic figure. Unsmiling, he
waits for the applause to die,
then launches into “Jerry,” an
intensely serious song of pro-
test about a chain-gang worker.
It .is sung magnificently, full-
bloodedly, yet with a piercing
sensitivity. The song over, the
spotlight snaps off, plunging the
stage into darkness again, and
the audience applauds a figure
they now cannot see —until he
emerges for his second song.
And so on.
This might give some idea
of how Harry Belafonte
operates in his show “Tonight
With Harry Belafonte” —seen
at Melbourne Palais before
it moved on to Sydney
Stadium this week. It is a

complex, high-pressured com-
bination of 20th-century show-
manship with the age-old art of
the folk - singer. And it is
perhaps inevitable that the
balance between the two is
not always satisfactorily main-
tained—the art often coming
off second-best.
Nevertheless, only the most
bigoted purist could deny that
Belafonte succeeds as perhaps
no other comparable big-name
artist has succeeded in this
country in penetrating to the
heart and soul of the various
foTk-idioms he ranges through
in his two-and-a-half hours on
stage.
Belafonte has considerable
physical attributes, and he is
not backward in making the
most of them. Magnificently
built, with a broad, handsomely
chiselled face, he repeatedly
calls on more resources than
his voice: he sways, hunches
his shoulders, flashes his eyes,
appeals with his long, expres-
sive hands, jerks to attention,
stamps his foot. It is all, of
course, finely calculated, pains-
takingly rehearsed like every-
thing else in the show, but
always there is a sense of spon-
taneity and ad lib.
Sometimes he sings with the
orchestra, sometimes with a
three-man chorus, but mostly
it is to the accompaniment of
two guitars, a big ‘bass and
bongo-drums. He subjects his
voice to an astonishing number
of moods and manners: he
shouts, yelps and growls, then
produces sweet, flute-like in-
flections. Here he acts the
embittered descendant of slaves
and the chained workman, there
the heart-sick lover ; here the
playful small boy, there the
contrite sinner.
Purists may protest: Bela-
fonte should not call himself
a folk-singer ; this is commer-
cialisation of the ethnic values
of the folk-idiom. They may
ask: Why all the production
“gimmickry”; why all the
different lighting, ranging
through various shades of blue,
lavender, and even pink? Why
the band? And they will have
a case. But Belafonte has,
among other things, an audi-
ence, and it is far, far larger
than any the purists could hope
to reach. It is a compromise,
certainly—but it is also great
entertainment.

“Simple Spymen”
Sydney Royal’s new farce
should have been set for the
Leaving Certificate instead of
Richard II; Leaving Certificate
audiences being what they are,
“Simple Spymen” would have
been more suited to their men-
tality if they wanted to watch
it, and if not, it wouldn’t so
much matter.
War Office and Secret Service
officials having appointed two
street-musicians by mistake to
procure an atomic invention
from a Turk in a French
boarding-house, the scene shifts
to the French boarding-house,
where the agents of Another
Power also await the Turk.
To spy each other out, one
of each side disguises himself
as a Turk, so that when the
real Turk arrives there are
three Turks emerging from
doors and fireplaces in well-
rehearsed confusion. It would
be wrong to spoil the enjoy-
ment of others by disclosing
the ending, and fortunately this
is impossible, as one has for-
gotten what it was.
The dialogue was something
Leaving Certificate students
might well have contrived,
although the jokes were some-
what older than Leaving stand-
ard (some were probably set in
16th-century papers); but what
could be done with them in
comic-paper mannerisms was
done by Colin Dando as a
corporal, Graeme Jones as a
lieutenant, Kenric Hudson as
a colonel, Geoffrey Hewitt as
an M. 1.5 official, Bun n e y
Brooke as a boarding-house
widow, Robert Healey as a
waiter, Silvia Budgen as a
boarding - house proprietress,
Max Bruch as a sinister foreign
agent, Nevil Thurgood as a
simple tough and Frank Cleary
as a Turkish inventor.
But when they were not en-
cumbered by words, the clown-
ing of Keith Petersen and
William Hodge, the producer,
warranted an occasional A,
while Hodge, accompanying a
song on a player-piano and
pronouncing “ FarqUharson,”
managed tentative second-class
honors.

“Traveller without
Luggage”
In George Fairfax’s excellent
production of this early (1936)
Anouilh play (Melbourne Little
Theatre) the author is seen
approaching a theme which,
down through the ages, has
provided writers with material
of timeless importance and
interest —the problem of iden-
tity.
A young War I soldier has
spent 18 years in an asylum in
a fruitless attempt to recover
his memory. People from all
over France are trying to claim
him; and one family, the
Renauds, are especially con-
vinced he is theirs. But he is
far from satisfied with the
details of his past that they
bring with them. Their lost
Gaston, it seems, was rather
violent, given to exterminating
small animals for the pleasure
of it, breaking his mother’s
heart, fighting with his best
friend and seducing his
brother’s wife; whereas our
hero likes to think of himself
as more sensitive, intelligent
and humane than most —and,
indeed, his own description
would seem to fit him better in
his present state.
But the evidence begins to
pile-up: a maid he is alleged
to have had an affair with
arrives and joins the others in
seeing in him the youth they
last saw departing for the war.
And finally his brother’s wife
informs him that he bears a
scar, the result of a deep pin-
prick she inflicted on him in a
fit of jealousy . . .
He privately examines him-
self before a mirror. Does he
find the tell-tale mark? We do
not learn till the final scene,
and it would spoil a good story
to give away his secret here.
Suffice to say that the resolu-
tion is thoroughly satisfying,
if perhaps a little light in
weight.
The Little was fortunate in
securing New Zealander
Edward Brayshaw for the cen-
tral role around which this
deadly-serious comedy revolves
so successfully. He suited the
role down to the last detail—

would surely have marred his

“The Hanging Tree”
This frontier-film about the
avarice, ignorance and
whipped -up violence which
confront a strong-minded doc-
tor at every turn when he
comes to establish a precarious
practice in a primitive gold-
seeking community is given
character by director Delmer
Daves, who builds a terrific
climax to proceedings which
throughout gravitate between
the interesting and the exciting.
Gary Cooper, still able in
advancing years to project an
air of quiet strength and re-
sourcefulness, always master of
every situation, is the doc.
Maria Schell sensitively por-
trays the accident-victim whose
presence in a wild community
becomes through no fault of
hers a disturbing influence;
and Karl Malden gives a con-
vincing study of a skulking
fossicker whose twin gods are
lasciviousness and greed.

An ailing tycoon’s wife is
the girl-friend of his doc., who
gives the Reaper a spot of
help with an air-bubbled
hypo.-needle. Then he has to
bump-off someone else to
cover the first tracks, and so
on, and on . . . The wholly
unconvincing proceedings are
topped-off by a climactic
situation of the most blatant
melodrama. Lana Turner
pushes the emotion-pedal to
the floor and keeps it there,
irrespective; the talents of
Anthony Quinn, who is forced
to drown his Hippocratic Oath
in a lot more lurid ones before
Nemesis overtakes him, are
quite wasted on such stuff.

THE CALL
Once more the childhood images return ;
The table’s set, the lantern softly lit,
And food, and gentle faces that I yearn
To touch again, and the wind calling it,
That name I had forgotten twenty years.
Once more the water’s sweet upon the
tongue ;
Once more the waves slap on the frozen
shore ;
I walk the quiet pathways of the young,
I breathe the chill dark air I breathed
before.
I taste the salty stinging of those tears.
My friends, where are you now ? Dick
Stone, John Bright
And David Sutcliffe under the Hanging
T ree.
I see your clear cold faces in the night,
The smoke and marshy tang of Dun-
more Lee,
And watch you dancing as the moon
appears.
Welt, it is gone, the dance of innocence.
Those tales of Grimm and Hoffmann on
the knee.
Hours of a dream when there was no
pretence,
Lovely and patient, sleeping and waking
free
Of passion, and the tantalus-cup of fears.

THE BALLAD OF THE
OLD CAPTAIN
Here’s a map of the world, I say —
Of the universe it may be —
And I sit down with compass and pen,
Ruler, dividers — I’m at it again —
To find out where I’m going.
I chart us clear of the boiling seas,
And of many a good ship’s peril
A t the edge of the world where sailors’
knees
Crumple beneath their loads of sin
For fear of life hereafter ;
And hope to berth in the Isles of Spice
For a cargo of sandalwood,
Cinnamon, fennel, everything good
To the nose of a skipper offended for
years
At freights of hide and skin.
I sign on a crew awash with beer,
As good as any other,
But I reckon without my lolly legs
That fumble me down to the wrong long
pier
Where a strange ship droops at her
moorings.
I flipperty-flop on a rolling bridge
Like a dumpling in a stew ;
A garrulous compass shows me the way
And the cross-eyed son of a drunk Malay
Hangs to a wheel askew.
We founder, of course, by berg or rock :
I don’t go down with the ship :
1 swim about for thirteen days
Then wash at last on a barren land
Like any piece of wreck.
There is never a sign of fruit or flesh
And certainly none of Friday ;
On a puddle of water and bony fish
My life is thin as a drunkard’s wish
And my soul near shrunk away.
I'm saved in time and put to bed
Like a piece of crinkled leather.
While parsons nourish my soul again,
Physicians and surgeons, all eminent men,
Restitch its case together.
Sister Comfort on hand in the wings
Counsels an easy life,
So I sit for a time in a rocking-chair,
While my head tic-toc to my pendulum
arms
Moves counter-clockwise nowhere;
But I find an old chart, and compass, and
pen —
Weigh anchor, you lubbers! I’m at it
v again!

DEAD BIRD IN THE NORTH
The professor led me upstairs
To my attic room. >
Framed in the skylight
Of Black-Country gloom'
(Where there was no shining
Of sky, and little light )
A dead bird on its back lay
With its legs upright,
A brownish little bundle
On the smudgy pane.
Two stiff legs for perching,
A stumpy beak of stone,
And wooden wings like feathers,
With a pane of glass for sky
And a slate roof for an inverted
Earth beneath which to fly.
A dead thing, upside down,
Never to be stirred.
Where better than a university
For the death of a singing bird ?

This concentration of production-

forces competitors to fight back by
launching diversified brands, which is an
expensive business.
Profitwise, last term was very success-
ful. The 75 p.c. jump in turnover resulted
in a corresponding leap in earnings.
Profit from “combined operations” for
the year ended June 30, 1960, was
£892,084 higher at £1,895,503.
This was after deducting £186,960 for
depreciation (up £64,962) and paying
directors’ fees (£8000). Taxation provi-
sion absorbed £728,600 (up £409,300),
leaving consolidated net profit at

•After deducting intangibles, £588,306 at 80/6/’6O.
The disproportionate increase in tax-
provision (which roughly corresponds to
disclosed consolidated earnings at 1958-59
rates) is due to the fact that the previous
term’s tax-slug was reduced by losses
incurred in the first two years.
Consolidated net profit increased by
over 71 p.c., representing an earning-rate
of 55.82 p.c. on the higher average ord.
capital. This compares with 40.54 p.c.
earned in 1959.
The div.-rate was increased from 10
p.c. to 15 p.c. and the cheque took-up
£316,406, being covered more than three
times.
Reserves were lifted by £861,197 to
£991,871 (after deducting £5350 . share-
issue expenses and £313 preliminary
expenses), net of £588,306 intangibles.
The board is building-up the co.’s re-
serves in view of the tough competitive
struggles looming ahead.
Last March paid capital was raised
to £2,531,250 by the issue of 843,750
20s. ords., one-for-two, at par. No
further capital-increases are anticipated
in the immediate future. Basically, the
board’s objective has been to keep sub-
scribed capital at a minimum. “The
efficient and rapid turnover of capital
throughout the year allows the co. to
work on lower profit-margins than it
would need if it were more heavily
capitalised.”
Seasonal purchases of tobacco-leaf are
financed by short-term borrowings. “The
financial arrangements are prudent and
present no danger to the future.”
Funds employed almost doubled.
Registered notes (£335,000) were re-
deemed on March 31, 1960, but loans
increased. Creditors, deposits and tax-
provision jumped by £2,631,289 to
£5,284,102:

Rapid growth necessitated expansion of
plant and premises, resulting in higher
book-values. Increasing turnover was
reflected in a higher volume of stocks
(up £2,752,537). Book-debts increased,
but are relatively unimportant as re-
tailers must settle within a week.
Theoretical working-capital amounted
to £990,308 (up £335,275). Net tangible
asset-backing worked out at 275. lOd.
for each 20s. ord.
In spite of extensions to plant, supply
lags behind demand for Rothmans’ pro-
ducts. Peter Stuyvesant and Rembrandt
brands are still being distributed on a
restricted basis.
Having successfully annexed a huge
slice of the nation’s cigarette-market,
Rothmans must now consolidate its
position and insure itself against a sudden
change in smoking-habits. This year
production of “plain” cigarettes will be
increased. The co. has plans to release
new brands.
Expansion will continue, but probably
at a slower rate. Competition can only
intensify as Rothmans penetrates further
and further into rival domains. The
smoke of the cigarette-battle is thickening.
Rothmans’ organisation has been
geared “for even tougher competition in
the year ahead.” Price-cutting, and an
extension of the brands-war, are anti-
cipated. Further progress will not be
easy, but Rothmans, the glamor-boy of
the sharemarket, appears to possess
enough stamina, resilience and financial
backing to continue to push its way
through.
Swings in consumer-tastes and a fall
in consumption of cigarettes constitute
the main potential dangers. Thus far
Rothmans’ stake on “king-size” filters
has paid-off handsomely.
Sharemarket enthusiasm is high, though
sometimes a little mercurial. At the last
sale in Sydney the 20s. ords. fetched
£5 19s. The immediate return is a

Eagers Holdings, Ltd.
■yOiTH Holdens still confidently in the
lead of the motor-vehicles market,
motor-distributors selling and servicing
G.M.-H. models continue to do well.
Competition is intensifying, spurred-
on by the relaxation of import-restric-
tions. The number of cars wholly or
partly imported is gradually rising. But
sales of Holdens continue to go up in
numbers, although G.M.-H.’s proportion
of' the total market has been slowly
shrinking.
The monthly average of registrations
of all motor-vehicles (excluding motor-
bikes) in Australia increased from 19,810
in 1958 to 22,335 in 1959. Of the 74,538
(up 15,648) new motor-vehicles registered
during five months to the end of last
May, 24,394 (or 32.7 p.c.) were Holdens.
This compares with 22,759 (or 38.6 p.c.)
in the previous corresponding period.
Figures for June, 1960, show a similar
trend.
The Eagers group of cos. distributing
and servicing G.M.-H. vehicles in
Queensland joined the Brisbane public
list in April, 1957. Paid capital on incor-
poration was £1,100,000 in 10s. ords.,
since unchanged.
Subsidiaries operate in Brisbane and
Queensland country-centres of Too-
woomba, Townsville and Mackay.
Business has been good, and the co. has
paid a steady 12| p.c. dividend from
the first full year of trading.
Last term turnover and earnings in-
creased, but trading conditions were
described as “very competitive with
attendant higher selling-costs, especially
in the used-car field.” W. A. Green, the
co.’s acting chairman, says that “these
conditions will continue as the volume of
deliveries increases.”
The group “maintained a reasonable
percentage of the new-vehicle total
market in areas of operation, compar-
able with results achieved throughout the
Commonwealth.” Requests for reduc-
tion in sales-tax were unsuccessful.
Consolidated trading-profit for the
year ended April 30, 1960, was £82,354.
higher at £426,374. This was after charg-
ing all expenses, writing-off £51,300 for
depreciation (up £4865) and providing
£25,000 for “building and development
programme.”
Provision for taxation absorbed
£192,450 (up £51,950), leaving consoli-
dated net profit at £233,924 (up £30,404).
This was equivalent to an earning-rate
of almost 21.7 p.c. on the average capital
employed, compared with 18.4 p.c. in the
previous year and 20.3 p.c. in 1958. If
the £25,000 transfer to building and
development provision is included with
consolidated net earnings the earning-
rate rises to 23.5 p.c. :

Tax - provision seems high in relation to
disclosed earnings, even allowing for the
£25,000 taken-off the profits for “building
and development.” The spill-over will
be useful in meeting increases in tax-
requirements under the new Budget.
The steady 12| p.c. div.-rate (£137,500)
was well covered. Reserves benefited by
£96,424 and by £4547 profit on sale of

Mortgage-secured loan from A.M.P.
Society (£32,500) was paid-off during the
year. Liquidity improved. Theoretical
working-capital amounted to £592,314
(up £50,709).
Current prospects are said to be fair.
The mildly deflationary Budget may
somewhat dampen consumer-demand and
decrease the rate of growth in car-sales,
but drastic changes in trading conditions
are unlikely.
Eagers’ scrip is well thought-of on the
Brisbane ’Change. At the last sale the
10s. ords. fetched 235. 9d. a unit for an
immediate return of 5.3 p.c. on the basis
of the 12| p.c. div.-rate.

Dennys, Lascelles, Ltd.
f\NLY moderately successful
in pre-war years, wool-
broker and stock-and-station
agent, Dennys, Lascelles, Ltd.,
has given an excellent account
of itself under the generally
favorable conditions prevailing
over most of the last decade,
net earnings during this period
averaging 26.4 p.c. on share
capital, increased in 1955, by
a two-for-five issue at par.
Today’s paid capital, £546,000,
held in f.-p. ords., is supported
by £712,817 of reserves (as
against £327,388 at the end of
the 1951 term), intangibles
appearing in the books at
£83,428.
Dennys, Lascelles has been
in the wool game, now, for
more than a century —the co.
was incorporated in 1857.
Head-office of the organisation
is in Geelong. All told, there
are 40 branches and 31 “special-
agencies” scattered throughout
the home State, Victoria, and
in the southern River i n a,
N.S.W. Activity is concen-
trated in the good rainfall areas
of the Western and Wimmera
districts, Thomas Mitchell’s so-
called Garden of Eden, and the
good rainfall areas of the Cen-
tral and North-eastern districts.
As a result, Dennys, Lascelles
picks-up generally, a better
than average fleece. The co.
handles somewhere in the
vicinity of 9 p.c. of the whole
Victorian wool clip.
The total Australian wool
clip for 1959-60 was a record
4.9-million bales ; 3 p.c. higher
than in the previous year.
Sales fetched an average all-
round, and much improved,
price of 57.92 pence per pound
(up 9.24 pence), but were still
at a low level, the second-

Melbourne probably these
were the most notable of the
many successes Opperman
registered at this time.
They were years in which
he consistently defeated the
champion wheelmen of other
countries who had come to
Australia for the motor-paced
matches of the track-season.
Although the mark of
Opperman’s greatness was
that he was capable of win-
ning any type of event up to
any distance, and under any
conditions, he was at his best
in the marathons, those road-
races over incredible distances
that called for physical fitness,
nerve and stamina of the
highest order.
It was his efforts in these
marathons, more than any-
thing else, that made him the
idol of the sporting public in
whatever country he was
appearing.
He knew the sport of cycling
to be as cruel and pitiless as
the sea. After one race he
wrote:
“To a tired man the track
has the maddening monotony
of solitary confinement. It is
so changeless in its resistance,
it is so consistently remorse-
less, with its returns giving
back exactly what one expends
in energy, and not one inch
more.”
Again:
“....from Geelong to Mel-
bourne the wheels began to
stick, but it was not until
dawn that the real crisis
arrived. Gippsland rain, steely
bright in the lights, had
numbed muscles deep into the
bone, knees were beginning to
grate, hands and wrists were
rejecting the weight of a sand-
wich, and the bicycle, so
resilient and light when I
started, seemed rigid and
heavy.”
■poLLOWiNG the 1928 Dunlop
Grand Prix, an enthusias-
tic public subscribed £1250 to
send a four-man team to the
Tour de France, a gruelling
3300-miier run in 22 stages.
Ernie Bainbridge, Percy
Osborne and Harry Watson
were the other members of
the team, with Opperman
captain.
Before the Tour de France
Opperman made his Continen-
tal debut in the 240-mile
Paris-Rennes. He came eighth.
Pitted against the best cyclists
in Europe, he was taught that
As Albury (and the “Border
Mail” photographer) saw him,

comed by the Mayor and Town
Band and citizens after 12 days’
cycling on his record-smashing
ride from Fremantle to Sydney.
he still had much to learn in
racing-tactics.
The Australians found that
14 of the 22 stages of the Tour
de France were run on a team
time-trial basis, and that the
Europeans, understandably
enough, were fielding the
official maximum ten against
their four.
The Australians covered the
first 1000 miles in eight days
before hitting the biggest
horror-stretch, the Pyrenees
Mountains on the Spanish
border. At that stage they
were not far from the leaders
on points, but sickness reduced
the quartet to a defiant trio,
whose herculean efforts against
the European teams were of
no avail. The opposition
literally ran them ragged.
Blistered and near exhaustion,
they finished well behind the
placegetters. But their efforts
won generous applause from
the French public, who had
not forgotten a similar tenacity
displayed by their countrymen
a decade before.
A lthough he had yet to win
a race on the Continent,
Opperman’s ability as a wheel-
man had not gone unnoticed
by the sport’s big following.
He started favorite for the
classic 80l d’or, a 24-hour
tandem and triplet-paced non-
stop event for which the
world’s best cyclists, fore-
gathered for. the Tour de
France, had entered.
He was rated so good that
one “sport,” who undoubtedly
had put his purse on another
rider, tried to nobble him by
filing half-through the chains
of his two racing-bikes. Dur-
ing the race, both chains
broke.
Manager Bruce Small pro-
duced a heavy roadster, com-
plete with mudguards, to keep
Opperman going while new
chains were fitted.
By the time he was back
on his own racers, Opperman
was 17 laps behind the leader.
He put his head down and
set-out to make-up the lag.
After 11 hours of furious
chasing he had caught the field.
An hour later he was ahead
of it. Then he settled down
to give the fans an exhibition
of riding they had never before
seen, nor have they seen its
like since. In that race he
logged an incredible 565 miles,
a record subsequent champions
have come nowhere near
toppling. At the end of the
24 hours he had broken seven
intermediate world records.
A delighted Bruce Small,
who knew just how far to
push the champion, suggested
he go on to have a crack at
the world’s 1000-kilometre
record.
“All I want is to get off this
bike,” protested the dog-tired
Opperman.
The crowd, who had been
watching the drama at the
finish-line, made-up his mind

for him. He heard them
roaring: “Allez, Oppy! Allez,
Oppy !” A wave of the hand
was his acceptance of the chal-
lenge. He climbed back into
the saddle and off he went;
and in just 79 minutes he had
the 1000-kilometre record in
safe keeping.

their future plans.

Opperman: “I don’t know

man’s greatest glory. Wherever

England ; London-York (un-
paced); 24-hour (unpaced);
London - Bath - London (un-

(unpaced).
Such achievements come pat
and easy when written on
paper ; they give little indica-
tion of the terrific strains to
which Opperman was subjected
in these marathons.
“Dozing with eyes half-shut,”
he wrote about this time of
one such ride, “it appeared
that dozens of others rode
with me. A figure dashed
directly at me from the fog;
I yelled frantically, jammed
on the brakes—it was my
shadow. Snatches of song,
thumps on the head, lifting of
the cap to be revived by the
chill, swinging of the arms—
yet sleep would win for a few
dangerous seconds. The
dreaded second night played
its full hand and, on occasions,
almost won. The dawn came
as a relief.”
After he had re-written their

record-books in his first
appearance in England (1934)
the English presented him with
the Bidlake Memorial Prize,
a trophy given for the out-
standing sporting performance
of the year, though there seems
to be some doubt as to what
they considered to be his most
meritorious performance. He
was the only Australian sports-
man to whom the English had
presented this coveted trophy.
When he returned to Aus-
tralia, Melbourne turned on
a civic reception for him at
which Prime Minister Joe
Lyons said he was proud to
propose the toast, which was,
simply, “Australia’s sporting
ambassador.”
Come consider the greatest
> ride of Oppy’s career was
when he broke the Kalgoorlie-
Perth unpaced road-record in
1933.
Certainly it was one of his
most spectacular. He put the
375 miles behind him in 25
hours 19 minutes, and even
though this record was sub-
sequently broken and recap-
tured by him, he made his bid
in some of the worst weather
the Westralians had experi-
enced in 50 years.
T eaving Kalgoorlie early one
morning he soon was
riding over the stretches that
passed for roads and into the
teeth of a raging headwind
that swirled up a duststorm
which didn’t abate until the
rain arrived. Deep desert sand
quickly became axle - deep
mud.
Frank Small, who accom-
panied him on that ride,
remembers the lonely figure
of Opperman standing on his
pedals, straining into the wind-
driven rain, all through the
day.
“When night came, we had
reached Southern Cross,” Frank
Small recalled, “and we had to
lift him from the bike. He was
in a near-rigid posture which
had resulted from long hours
of upright pedalling while a
caking of mud, which had set
like plaster, helped the illusion
of a body in the early stages
of rigor mortis.”
They bundled Opperman
into a hot bath at Southern
Cross. An A.B.C. radio-
commentator, who was travel-
ling by car behind the
champion, asked him if he
were fit enough to go on.
“Go on?” said Opperman.
“Of course I'm going on. I’ve
got to finish what I started!”
The broadcaster relayed this
information to 6WF, Perth.

ticularly in the far-western
areas, the result, on the whole,
can be construed as very satis-
factory. Sales of sheep and
cattle, also, exceeded the
1958-59 record and land sales
were well maintained.
Judged on last terms’ effort,
Dennys, Lascelles’ quest for
the golden fleece —in the more
favored rural areas —was well
rewarded. Earnings from trad-
ing operations, after allowing
for doubtful debts and includ-
ing £1562 income from invest-
ments, were £962,434 (up
£ 135,006). Pre-tax profit showed
marked improvement (up
£78,982 at £254,306) also, the
rate of growth, 45 p.c., was
well above the 22 p.c. incre-
ment in the national wool
cheque. After tax £lOl,OOO

itself to cover the added

and depreciation £37,703 (up

had, by comparison, gained
even further lustre (up £48,482

of 46.2 p.c.).

and 27.1 p.c. back to 1955.
The fluctuations, so clearly
apparent, are demonstrative of
a relative independence, when
viewed alongside the perform-
ances of other pastoral con-
cerns, from, and a degree of
dissociation with, the constantly
varying ups and downs of the
world wool market; they do,
of course, in absolute measure,
reflect a very pronounced sym-
pathy.
Dennys, Lascelles lifted the
div. rate from 15 p.c. to \l\
p.c. last term, and in so doing
lifted the average handout
since 1951 to 16.8 p.c. Reserves,
augmented by profits from the

provided written-back, £2433
and capital profit £625 on

all told, £65,133.

boosted book-debts and credi-

respectively. Bank - overdraft
jumped £117,794 to £159,398,
with cash rising also, up
£75,625 at £226,624.

Theoretical working - capital
appears to be ample, setting
the current ratio at 1.9 to 1.
During the year, Dennys, Las-
celles commenced erection of a
second section at the new wool-
store in Broughan Street, Gee-
long. Funds channelled into
this project, which, incidentally,
has since been completed,
boosted the book-value of free-
holds a net £69,135. The book-
value of plant slipped £12,345
to £74,147.
Preliminary forecasts indi-
cate a drop of 4 p.c. in the
quantity of wool coming-up
for auction in the current wool-
selling season. The inception
of the new all-round-the-year
auction system has sent most
prices to their lowest level in
15 months, but at this stage
conservative opinion reckons
the setback of temporary sig-
nificance only. However, wool
prices and weather are still the
determinants of pastoral per-
formance, and they are both
unstable, unpredictable and in
a constant state of flux.

Smaller Surplus
A surplus of £l5 million
was recorded in New Zealand's
overseas exchange transactions
for the year ended June, 1960,
compared with a surplus of
£4l million for the previous
year.
The net overseas assets of
the banking system rose from
£98,900,000 on July 1, 1959,
to £118,700,000 on June
29, 1960, an increase of
£19,800,000.
The discrepancy between
this increase and the overall
surplus of £l5 million is ex-
plained by differences in timing
and exchange-valuation.
In the year’s transactions on
a current-account basis there
was a surplus of £29,500,000,
compared with a surplus of
£12,800,000 for the year ended
June, 1959, and a deficit of
£77,100,000 for the 1958 June
year.
Total receipts for the year
were approximately at the
same level as for the year
ended June, 1959.
Total export receipts in-
creased by £31,200,000.
Receipts for butter, wool and
other exports rose, but those
for cheese and meat declined.
Receipts for butter increased
by £2B million, due mainly
to sales at high prices during
the latter half of 1959.
The lower level of cheese
receipts, which fell by
£3,600,000 to £19,200,000, was
due mainly to sales at lower
prices during the first half of
1960, compared with the first
half of 1959.
The fall in receipts for
meat, from £79,600,000 to
£74,700,000, was mainly due
to the low prices obtained for
mutton and lamb on the
United Kingdom market dur-
ing the second half of 1959.
The fall in receipts also
reflects a change in remit-
tance arrangements because of
the fact that since the increases
in the British bank-rate from
4 p.c. to 5 p.c. in January,
1960, and to 6 p.c. in June,
1960, the time between the
date of shipment and the date
the overseas exchange is
received has lengthened.
Wool Production
It is estimated that there
was an increase in N.Z.’s pro-
duction of wool of about
5 p.c., while prices for the
1959-60 season, which aver-
aged about 45d. per lb., were
25 per cent, higher than during
the previous season.
These factors, together with
a reduction in wool stocks
held by the New Zealand
Wool Commission, caused an
increase of £24,500,000 in
receipts for wool, which
totalled £111,500,000.
In other exports there were
increases under most com-
modity headings.
Total payments compared
with the previous June year
increased by £26,200,000 to
£344,500,000 because of in-
creases under all the main
headings except payments for
Government imports.
The fall in payments for
Government imports of
£4,900,000 to £22,400,000 was
more than offset by the increase
of £500,000 in payments for
debt interest and an increase
of £14,900,000 in other Gov-
ernment payments.
An increase in Government
overseas investment from
£4,600,000 to £16,200,000, and
an increase in debt-repayment
of £3,300,000, were responsible
for the increase in other
Government payments.
An increase in payments for
private imports of £15,700,000
brought the total of these pay-
ments to £227,200,000. Com-
pared with the second half of
1958 payments for private
imports during the second
half of 1959 were £5,300,000
lower, reflecting a lower level
of business activity.
Tasman Paper
In the last two months the
shares of N.Z.’s biggest com-
pany, Tasman Pulp and Paper,
have risen in price from 265.
6d. to 335. (N.Z.).
In a recent address, Sir
Bernard Ashwin, a director
of the company, suggested
that, within the next 15 to 20
years, production of news-
print in N.Z. might well rise
to about 500,000 tons a year
with a saving of about
£30,000,000 in overseas funds.
In addition, there would be
a greater market for long-
fibred pulp for Use in Austra-
lian production of paper and
board for packaging and
building, and also a bigger
market for timber, he said.
In recent months, operating
efficiency by the Tasman
company had come up the last
important 10 per cent., and
both the pulp- and paper-mills
were producing at volumes
beyond the designed rated
capacity.
“This will be reflected in
better financial return in
future. When the second
paper-machine comes into
operation in about two years’
time, overheads will be spread
over a much larger production
and shareholders will be
pleased with the financial
results,” Sir Bernard said.
Television
The development of tele-
vision in New Zealand will
enter a new phase this month
when the Government experi-
mental station at Auckland
steps-up transmission to give
viewers eight hours of regular
entertainment weekly.
Between October and
February three five-kilowatt
transmitters are expected from
the United Kingdom for instal-
lation at Christchurch, Wel-
lington and Dunedin, in order
of priority. They will take
only a short while to come
into operation, but, initially,
will give only an experimental
service.
Not till there are enough
viewers will commercial pro-
grammes be introduced.
At the present rate it will
take up to five years for the
four main centres to have full
services from permanent
stations.
Freight on Cars
New Zealanders will have
to pay £5 to £lO more for
motor-cars as a result of a
decision of the New Zealand
shipping-lines to increase in-
coming cargo freights by 7
per cent, on November 1.
The freight-rise will mean
several hundred fewer cars a
year, because import licences
are based on cost including
freight. The £5 to £lO
increase will apply to cars
brought to N.Z. in knocked-
down condition.


Tte dag o o-bee
by
NORMAN KING
When we lived on the
river, January was
always our busiest
month, mainly because
it was the time that the sap
was rising in the black-wattle.
Cutting wattle-bark was the
hardest work I have ever done
and it was only in January that
the hard outer covering came
off with relative ease. For that
reason, we worked from morn-
ing to dark during January,
the major portion of our Christ-
mas school-holidays.
January always had other
interests for us. It was, accord-
ing to the Old Man, the best
time to rob wild bees. He
used to say that, if the bush
nests were robbed in January,
there was enough time left for
the bees to lay-in another stock
of honey before winter came.
Cutting wattle-bark always
gave us plenty of scope to look
for wild bees’ nests, and Mike
often disappeared for an hour
or so at a time looking for bees.
Mike never did take kindly to
handling black-wattle and it
was no coincidence that, each
January, his hands were not
as deeply stained with the
purple sap as those of the rest
of us.
Mike was a malingerer.
Things were always happening
to him in the bush. He caught
a platypus on a set-line in the
river one Christmas-time and
his thumb got spiked when he
was releasing the odd, duck-
billed creature. His hand
swelled to almost twice its
normal size and turned black.
Mike didn’t cut much black-
wattle that January.
Another year he gashed his
hand while sharpening an axe
and had to go into the doctor’s
at Lithgow to get it stitched.
The wound became infected
and took six weeks to heal pro-
perly. Joe said he caught Mike
rubbing river mud into the
gash, but Ma wouldn’t believe
him. She had a soft spot for
Mike, who loafed around the
house most of that January,
too.
The effect of the 25 per cent,
reduction in our work-force
can be imagined, and the three
of us, slogging away at the iron-
hard wattle, used to think dark
thoughts about Mike.
For his part, the Old Man,
we felt, had a sneaking admira-
tion for the manner in which
Mike dodged his share of the
hard labor.
The trout always seemed to
bite better in January, and
Mike’s injuries never seemed
to affect his fishing-skill. Ma
was always praising him for
keeping the larder well filled
with speckled trout. Joe, who
loved fishing more than any-
thing else, apart from eating,
used to lean on his axe-handle,
his brown body glistening with
sweat, and look wistfully down
at the river. He and the Old
Man never hit it off too well
during January.
TX7E were stripping bark on a
"" steep hillside one swelter-
ing afternoon when Mike, who
had been missing since 2
o’clock, reappeared from the
thick scrub to announce he
had found the bees’ nest. Mike
sat on a pile of curling, dried
bark to tell us about it. We
stopped work and listened
attentively. Robbing a nest
always gave us a break in the
monotony of stripping bark.
“They’re Dago-bees,” Mike
assured us. “I’ve been tracking
’em for days.”
“Yair,” Joe said sourly.
“You’re not telling us a thing
we don’t know! ”
The Old Man was taking the
opportunity to roll a smoke,
grinding the thin slices of plug
between the heels of his hands.
As usual, he wasn’t looking
directly at Mike, but was star-
ing thoughtfully out over the
river valley to the scrub-covered
ranges where a mass of storm-
cloud was muttering dire
threats to itself.
This was a mannerism of the
Old Man’s. He regarded his
sons as rather interesting crea-
tures, not yet men, but well
advanced past the childhood
era. They were a source of
amusement to him, but he
always preferred to laugh in-
wardly.
Mike ignored his older
brother. Joe had the brawn,
he agreed ; but he had the
brains of the family. He
respected Joe’s brawn and it
was a constant source of regret
to him that Joe didn’t respect
his brains.
“They’re Dago-bees, all
right,” Mike said, addressing
himself obliquely to the Old
Man. “They’re got their nest
in a split stringybark up there
on the ridge. It’s a tough-
looking tree.”
This was a subtle challenge
to the Old Man who, proud
of his axemanship, let it be
known that no tree was too
big or too tough for him to
fell.
The Old Man nodded dis-
tantly, accepting the chalk,,
We sighed quietly with relit
it meant that, if he dropped k
his tracks ,t would be thetj
Man, single-handed, who feL
the tree containing the beer
nest.
For my part, I felt irniw
grateful to Mike.
“We might have a go at- cm
later, when she gets a »
cooler,” the Old Man said
He was like that. He always
declined to commit himself
irrevocably to any decisis
But he never changed his it
“Those Dago-bees k\
pretty wild,” Mike warned, pit-
longing the discussion as long
as he could. “One of da
made a pass at me when 1 was
looking up at the spot where
they’ve got their nest. They’re
real Dagoes.”
The phrase pleased Mile,
The wild bush-bees were cer-
tainly an Italian strain imported
by the apiarists who passet
along the river with their
dozens of little white boxes
during the years of the flower
ing-box. The bees multiplied
and grew fat on the pollen from
the masses of little cream-anil'
white flowers so that swarms
of them were forced to tot
the badly overcrowded hi®
and fend for themselves,
But Mike wasn’t referring a
their ancestry. He simplj
meant that the bees were sffll
black and excitable.

The art in international living these days—as
Australia is discovering—is to know and to be
known; to understand and to be understood.
We are learning that lesson in our efforts to
establish trade and friendship, particularly where
it touches Asia and the Pacific.
Its moral is suggested again in the
announcement that an Australian trade mission
will be leaving soon to survey the major markets
of South America. It will visit Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama,
Uruguay and Venezuela.
The results of this mission will be watched with
interest—and for more reasons than the immediate
trade it is likely to produce. For actually, we know
little about the people of South America, and they
know little about us. s
How many realise, for instance, that the nations
to be covered by the trade mission have an
aggregate area more than twice the size of our own
continent? Brazil alone is larger than Australia.
The foundations for a fruitful understanding
between us were made by history. It was the
Spanish and Portuguese colonisation of South
America in the sixteenth century that later led
Magellan down to round Cape Horn and enter the
Pacific. That way, too, came James Cook in 1770
to discover Eastern Australia. But those associations
were to drift on the currents of circumstance.
The preoccupation of settling our own section
of the New World, combined with the opening of
the trade routes westward, kept us on our part from
strengthening the lines between.
There has never been any good reason why
these two large units of the Southern Hemisphere
should have remained virtual strangers. There is
even less reason today, when the courses of
commerce are changing and opportunities are
opening for that closer human contact which comes
with a wider dispersal of trade.
So we can wish this mission well, and trust it
will be the first of many moves to span the distance
that has separated us too long from the nations of
South America.

A bout fifteen minutes later,
*** as darkness was setting in,
the bees seemed to settle down
and the Old Man decided it was
time to finish what he had
started.
The bees had set up a con-
fused buzzing, but the semi-
darkness baffled them, so that,
although they crawled blindly
over our hands and arms, they
didn’t sting. The Old Man
pulled them off in handfuls and
dropped them at his feet.
He made two cuts in the
hollow tree-trunk and prised
out a section of wood that,
when lifted exuded the wild,
sweet scent of box-honey.
In the gathering darkness, we
cut out the honeycomb and
dropped it in thin sections into
the kerosene-tin. In a matter
of minutes, everything was
covered in a layer of thick,
yellow honey.
It was always the Old Man’s
policy to leave a little honey
and a section of comb “to
give the bees a bit of a kick
along” after robbing them, and
he didn’t scrape-out all the
contents of the hollow tree.
Part of the honeycomb had
been shattered when the tree
fell, and he left this, so that
the hollow trunk of the tree was
an inch deep in spilt honey.
Mike, who liked sweet things,
dipped into the gluey mess and
lifted out a piece of the crushed
comb. He said the wax always
seemed to contain the sweetest
honey.
What he didn’t know was
that a bee, trapped when the
tiny symmetrical cells exploded,
lay half-drowned in the honey.
As Mike swallowed, the bee
came to life and stung him on
the back of the tongue.
Mike howled in agony and,
in a matter of minutes, his
tongue dilated to more than
twice its normal size. Then,
first his cheeks, then his eyes,
began to swell and he couldn’t
see a foot in front of him.
Mike began to gasp for
breath and we thought he was
going to choke. With Joe
leading him, we set out for
home, the Old Man, axe over
his shoulder, leading the way.
I carried the heavy tin of
honey.
Joe gave Mike a rough trip
down the hillside ; getting a bit
of his own back, he told us
next day. Mike, blubbering,
helpless and blind, his face
round as a balloon, stumbled
after him, breathless and
frightened.
Next day, Mike was a little
better, but his face was still
swollen and his eyes were noth-
ing but slits. He stayed in bed

What is the Limit of Taxation?
Parkinson Strikes Again
Law-making is a habit that
grows on its own success,
as any community which
establishes a legislature
quickly finds out —though not
quickly enough to reverse the
process once started. Appar-
ently individual lawmakers
aren't exempt from the rule.
This comment is prompted by
the promulgation of Parkin-
son’s Second Law in Professor
C. Northcote Parkinson’s The
Law and the Profits (John
Murray ; Heinemann’s).
Parkinson’s Law (herein-
after to be referred to as
Parkinson’s First Law and
losing something of its force
and dignity in the change) pro-
claimed that work expands to
fill the time available for its
completion, and by applying
it to the public service he
showed that a bureaucracy is
by its very nature self-
perpetuating, and empire-
building within departments
inevitable.
T>arkinson’s Second Law is:
Expenditure rises to meet
income. With individuals this
is easily demonstrated. The
breadwinner gets a rise in
salary. He and his wife decide
how the increased income will
be spent. It is spent more or
less as planned and the family
finances are back as they were
before the rise. Often the
plans for spending are made
before the rise is received. This
facilitates the spending when
the extra money arrives. But
if the spending precedes the
rise and the rise doesn’t
eventuate bankruptcy follows.
With Governments, says
Parkinson, it’s different. They
decide how much they want
to spend and then impose taxes
sufficient to cover that amount.
And when, under the exigen-
cies of war, expenditure rises
prodigiously and taxes with
it, means are devised when
the war is over to find ways
of maintaining the same level
of expenditure. The revenue
is there, why not use it?
“The public revenue is re-
garded as limitless, and expen-
diture rises eternally to meet
it,” and although there are
physical limits to many types
of individual' extravagance —
e.g., dining, wining and the
delights, of dancing-girls—the
same is not true of depart-
mental luxuriance:
Economic and cultural advisers
can multiply beyond the point at
which concubines might be thought
a bore; beyond the point even at
which they might be thought
unbearable.
The system is aided by the
fact that the form in which
public accounts are presented
was not of the latest pattern
even 300 years ago and is now
“beginning to verge on the
obsolete.” It was described in
Sketch by Osbert
“... found ways of compounding manorial dues.”
1904 as “unsystematic, unscien-
tific, complicated and so pre-
sented as to conceal and even
falsify the facts.” Parkinson
remarks, with moderation, that
“British public accounts are
not quite in line with current
methods of accountancy.” He
continues with the comment
that they would “disgrace and
discredit a third-rate dog-
racing company . . . They are
not true and they do not bal-
ance . . . They present only a
picture of archaic and dignified
confusion.”
In explanation why this
state of affairs continues des-
pite complaints and despite
royal commissions, he says:
In the presence of wolves, sheep
are said to form a tight hunch
with horns outward and the
weakest in the centre. Civil ser-
vants do the same. Faced by a
common danger, they take-up that
formation, yielding nothing, deny 4
ing everything, concealing all. This
is a well-known fact of biology
and one against which the commis-
sioners must struggle in vain. Their
report, when eventually printed,
might just as well be placed in the
toilet. Whatever happens to it,
the matter is allowed to drop.
TTow far can this ascending
scale of expenditure and
taxes go? Is there a limit? Yes.
“Taxes tend to increase, be-
coming heavier until the point
is reached at which society col-
lapses under their weight.”
As an instance of this
Parkinson cites the French
Revolution, which he says
occurred because there was a
limit beyond which taxation
could not go. The peasants
were actually more prosperous
than they had been for cen-
turies, but were more adept at
concealing such wealth as they
had —“and they may have
found ways of compounding
their manorial dues.” The
reason taxation fell only on the
relatively poor was that suc-
cessive French Governments
had met current needs by
mortgaging future revenue.

giant had let go the ball.
Furban.
“K.R.”: I’m not greatly
worried that Meckiff and
Rorke will “meet with the
same fate as Griffin” if selected
for England. The “example”
made of Griffin is not very
encouraging; at the same time it
must be remembered that English
county cricket has a big financial
stake in successful Australian
cricket-tours. It would seem un-
likely that much of the financial
success of the tour would be
jeopardised by the “outlawing” of
two bowlers whom the English
cricketing public would be particu-
larly keen to see in action.
Still, unless this “throwing”
question can be settled very soon
to everyone’s satisfaction, and all
recriminations cease, cricket as an
international game will very likely
come to a sudden end.
“Throwers,” of course, are not
something new; they’ve always
been with the game. One point
to note is that the “thrower” does
not rouse any undue criticism
(particularly by English critics)
until he starts getting among the
wickets (particularly if they are
English wickets).
I cannot see how a man, from
a running start, can possibly throw
the ball as fast, as straight, and
with as much swerve and “seam”
as he can bowl it. I can’t see it!
Nor can he “bump” it as well.
(The matter of “drag” with a fast-
bowler is a different matter, and is
something that should be clamped-
down on. This is where Rorke
mainly offends, though he’s by no
means the only fastie to do so.)
Some spin-bowlers, off-spinners
in particular, with their jerky
deliveries, look as if they throw,
and some probably do. I don’t
think it has been proved that the
“thrown” ball picks up any more
wickets.
On the question of “throwing”
spin-bowlers, it may be recalled that
Australia’s famous left-hand spinner
of 30 years ago, Bert Ironmonger,
was never taken on a tour of
England because the Australian
selectors thought (so it is believed)
that he would never b - e allowed
to get through an over. Without
doubt Ironmonger would have got
wickets in England, if & had been
allowed to bowl.
It’s sometimes suggested that
“throwing” is peculiarly Austra-
lian ; but there are the suspects
among English bowlers, too, and
always have been. Two “suspect”
contemporaries, both mighty fine
bowlers, are Statham and Lock.
In the 1930’s there was one at least
—fast left-hander Clark. A good
but Bradman and Pons-
ford’s record 451 second-wicket
partnership in the fifth 1934 Test
was made against Clark, among
other bowlers.
The old story told of Vic
Trumper when his batting partner
complained to him that the bowler
was throwing—“ Keep your voice
down; the umpire will hear you,
and have him taken off” —should
be kept well in mind in the present
to-do.

Whether Australia’s cham-
pion three - year - old filly,
Wenona Girl, will contest the
A.J.C. Derby won’t be decided
till her owner—S.T.C. chair-
man Bill Longworth—sees
how she goes in the Canter-
bury and Rosehill Guineas.
Certainly on her brilliant win
over the colts Sky High and
Persian Lyric in the Hobart-
ville Stakes at Warwick Farm
last Saturday she would seem
to be well up to classics’ stan-
dard. She won without much
effort. On his solid confor-
mation and breeding-back-
ground Persian Lyric appears
at this stage a real Derby
chance. He’s a brother to
Prince Darius and is also
related to Trivalve, Nuffield
and Hall Mark.
Progeny of the French-bred sire
Wilkes did particularly well in
their first season (ended July 31),
and they could continue the good
work this term.. Best representative
to date is Wenona Girl, with Prince
Wilkes also in fine winning form.
Wilkes—a son of Court Martial
and Sans Tares by Sind —is one
of the best-bred horses to come
to Australia. Big offers have been
made to get him back to the other
side of the world, but they are
not likely to draw studmaster
John Kelly, of Newhaven Park,
Boorowa (N.S.W.), who again
secured big prices for the sons and
daughters of Wilkes at the April
sales.
In regard to the Derby, it may
be worth keeping in mind that
Skyline had been regarded more
as a sprinter than a stayer till
he easily won the A.J.C. Derby
in race-record time. His owner,
Brian Crowley, expects Sky High
to emulate that brother of his and
land the Derby in October. Worth
remembering, too, that the filly
Wiggle beat Skyline in the Hobart-
ville.

It was a refreshing change
to see an amateur win the
Australian Open last week--
though it left a doubt as to
whether one should have been
pleased with the amateurs or
disappointed with the profes-
sionals.
Full credit, of course, must go
.o the amateurs who produced
such outstanding golf. Notwith-
standing that they had had a great
deal of practice on the course,
Bruce Devlin’s 6-under-par total
would have been a credit to any
golfer, and few could match Ted
Ball’s brilliantly consistent scoring
over a fortnight’s competitive golt.
Yet Nagle, playing with an injured
hand, led the professionals, and
f ew of them coaid manage a
four-round total of par figures or
better.
Winner and runner-up -in the
Open, together with Coogan and
Routley, make up the Eisenhower
Cup team —and a pretty good team
ft is, judging by their present form.
Phillip Billings has been named
emergency, and it must have been
a close go for the last place
between himself, Cr*w and Vic
Bulgin. If Crow had won the
Open, instead of finishing third,
the selectors would probably have
had to pick the team out of a
hat.

“Golfer”; Easterners who
visited Perth for the Austra-

found Westralians enthusias-
tic about a tournament-system
which looks like catching-on.
The system is known as “shot-
gun tourneys.” In these com-
petitions all players start at the
same time, but .from different
tees. More than one four can
start on five-bogey holes. It
is most suitable for social
tournaments, because all finish
about the same time, all can
take dinner together, and
prizes can be awarded in a
group assembly.


UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
CONGO: EFFECTS ON BELGIUM
A special correspondent of
London “Economist” re-
ports on a neglected aspect of
the Congo disaster —its effect
on Belgium, the country which
so speedily (too speedily, many
commentators have argued)
granted the Congo its indepen-
dence :
“As the magnitude of the
disaster has sunk-in in Brussels
there has been a wave of self-
examination, criticism and, in
some quarters, a search for
scapegoats. It is a remarkable
contrast with the habitual
neglect of Congolese affairs in
Belgian political life.
“On the Right, the Liberal
party, which has close ties with
industrial interests, has clearly
indicated that there are many
aspects of the Government’s
policy with which it disagrees,
even though it forms part of
the coalition with the Social
Christians led by M. Eyskens
[the Prime Minister], The
Liberals now claim—although
they did not say so before —
that the march to independence
was too swift; the Government
has been legalistic and pusil-
lanimous in not standing-up to
M. Lumumba; above all, it
ought to have recognised M.
Tshombe’s independent Gov-
ernment [in Katanga] the day
it was set up. A section of the
Right-wing press gives boister-
ous backing to these views.
“Sniping has also been com-
ing from the other flank, where
the Socialists have been point-
ing out that the disasters of
today are the result of past im-
providence, of the gross failure
of successive Governments to
prepare for independence by
providing higher education for
the Congolese and by African-
ising the Administration. This
criticism carries more weight
than that of the Liberals, for
the Socialists have advocated
these policies in the past. They
are echoed by a good many
Belgians, in and out of Govern-
ment, who know the Congo.
“But though criticism of past
failings has been bitter and
searching, none of the critics
can really offer an alternative
policy for the future. There
have been continual rumors
that the Liberals were about to
leave the Government. And
they have been forcefully
demanding the resignation of
the two Social Christian Minis-
ters who have been mainly
responsible for Congolese
affairs.
“But the Prime Minister and
the moderate elements in his
party have had an easy answer
to Right-wing critics; until
disaster came the Liberals gave
full support to the Govern-
ment. If heads are to roll, the
Christian Socialists point out,
then Liberal heads should be
amongst them.
“On their side, the Socialists
have shown a marked lack of
enthusiasm for sharing the
responsibility of government
just now. At each twist in the
London “Time and Tide” cartoon comment on the first
weeks of the Kennedy and Nixon campaigns for the
U.S. Presidency.
crisis the Government looks
like falling ; but there is in fact
no viable alternative.”
John Ardagh, writing in
London “News Chronicle,”
notes a Belgian bitterness to-
wards both the United Nations
and Belgium’s allies:
“The U.N. is accused of
treating Belgium unfairly by
sacrificing principle to expedi-
ent under pressure from Russia.
Shades of Suez! Nearly all
Belgium’s allies save France
are felt to have failed in sym-
pathy. London and especially
Washington are unpopular for
giving Lumumba such a warm
official welcome.”
The Economic Losses
However, both Ardagh and
the “Economist” correspondent
believe that the strictly econo-
mic losses to Belgium will be
less severe in the long run than
is widely supposed.
“Many Belgian economic ex-
perts told me,” writes Ardagh,
“they reckoned that even if
Belgium lost all her interests in
the Congo her expansion would
be set back less than a year.
“This is based on the fact
that the Congo accounts for
only 3.2 per cent, of Belgium’s
gross national product, which
itself is growing at the rate of
4 per cent, a year.
“Belgian exports to the
Congo (2.3 per cent, of her
total) were negligible compared
with the rate of expansion of
her exports elsewhere. The
Congo provides Belgium with
nothing she could not
obtain elsewhere—even copper
is plentiful on the world
markets. Above all, Belgium
is now so buoyed-up by the
dynamic Common Market that
she ought to recover from her
Congo troubles as easily as
Holland from the loss of
Indonesia.
“Some firms and individuals
will, of course, suffer more
sharply. The Government is
having to spend a good deal of
money on compensating and
resettling refugees, some of
whom have lost everything, and
on paying for the airlift and the
troop operations. It will prob-
ably have' to honor Belgian
shareholders’ dividends in
Congo Government Bonds to
the tune of £l7 million a year.
“This will lead to a Budget
deficit this year, which will
almost certainly have to be
met by higher taxes. That is
what M. Eyskens means by his
‘austerity programme.’

World Fibre
Consumption
P xamining statistics of world
fibre - consumption for
1959, Bradford “Wool Record”
notes that “however small tk
world’s appetite for wool my
be —and it is worth mentm-
ing, all the same, that there is
no carry-over of any signi-
ficance —its taste for other
fibres seems to be insatiable”:
“World fibre - consumption
for 1959 was over 14-million
tons (of which wool was not
much over 1-million tons). In
1948 it was less than 9-million
tons. Even when generous
allowance is made for the rise
in world population, the fact
must be faced that the world
per - caput consumption of
‘other fibres’ is rising at a fat
greater rate than the world
per - caput consumption of
wool.
“The king of fibres statisti-
cally is still cotton, and
nobody could grumble abof
that. But it is a little stranf
that the world’s biggest ®

United States, while, that same
country’s consumption of woo

basis, Britain uses twice

Malays, Chinese, In-
ave realised the neces-
sity of co-operation if the new
State is not to be torn apart.
“But this co - operation,
which has already had its
strains, may become harder to
achieve in the coming years.
As Mr. John Lowe points out
in a Fabian Society research-
pamphlet, the 1957 Constitution
will give more and more
Malayan Chinese and Indians
the vote, so that if full Parlia-
mentary democracy continues
the Malays in five years will
probably have lost their politi-
cal predominance. That will be
the testing time.
“How it survives will depend
very much on economic cir-
cumstances for, as Mr. Lowe
says, ‘Malaya’s economic in-
equalities are largely cotermin-
ous with her racial structure,’
and those inequalities are actu-
ally being aggravated by in-
dustrialisation. ‘Political prob-
lems,’ he believes, ‘will tend to
take care of themselves pro-
vided that the economic in-
feriority of the Malay race can
be redressed.’ ”
Meanwhile, does the end of
the state of emergency mean
that the Malayan Communists
are no longer a danger? Harry
Miller, reviewing the situation
in London “Sunday Times,”
reports evidence of “another
and more dangerous Commun-
ist threat —subversion”:
“Experts believe that the
Communist underground will
attempt to develop new leader-
ship among the young Chinese
secondary-school students and
the intelligentsia, who have
already shown they can be
moulded into good Communist
material, finding their inspira-
tion from Red China.
“Captured documents have
disclosed that the Communists
intend to use Opposition politi-
cal parties, trade-unions and
students’ organisations as a
cover. It is believed that they
will use force again only when
they consider that most of the
structure of Malayan society—
including the police and armed
services—is controlled by their
members. This would be the
time when the waiting farce in
South Thailand—if it had not
been broken meanwhile
would come in.
“An authority on Malayan
Communism told me: ‘The
Communist threat remains be-
cause the Communists believe
they will rise again.’ The
Malayan Government is well
aware of the dangers. One
notable step it has taken has
been the reorganisation of
Malaya’s superb Special Branch
to concentrate against subver-
sive activity.
“The Communists are pre-
pared to bide their time, how-
ever. And what better example
for them that patience pays
dividends that that of Mao Tse-
tung, who spent 30 years ‘in the
Chinese jungle’ waiting till
China was ripe for the pick-
ing?”
China's Bomb
T ooring through Chinese
Premier Chou En-lai’s
transparent proposal that
South-east Asia and the Pacific
be made into a zone free of
nuclear weapons, a special
correspondent of London
“Spectator” makes some dis-
turbing predictions.
The proposal was made
“primarily to get an angry,
negative reaction from the
American State Department,
and in this it succeeded. Mr.
Chou’s proposal has been dis-
missed as a meaningless propa-
ganda gesture.
“Now, with the Chinese
suggestion repulsed, the way
is open for her to explode her
first atomic bomb. It has been
ready for some months, await-
ing an internationally politi-
cally opportune moment. Signs
point to detonation some time
in early October —the autumn
is traditionally the Chinese
season for experiments and
aggression.
“When the Chinese bomb
goes off, and it will certainly
be altogether bigger and better
than de Gaulle’s, Chou can
accuse the State Department
of a refusal to discuss Chinese
unselfishness in offering to
deny herself membership of
the Bomb Club.
“Doubtless the detonation
will be followed by irresistible
requests for recognition, admis-
sion to U.N.O. and the Inter-
national Disarmament Con-
ference.
“Mr. Chou’s additional plea
for peaceful coexistence
follows hard on a similar but
genuine one three weeks ago
from Madame Sun Yat Sen.
This should be seen only as


a gesture to placate this for-
midable lady, whose two
sisters, Mei-Ling and Ah-Ling,
became Madame Chiang Kai-
Shek and a Wall Street mil-
lionairess respectively. Ching-
Ling—Madame Sun Yat Sen
—is a Vice-Chairman of the
Communist State Council.”
Law and Outer Space
A s rocket technology ad-
vances, the need for inter-
national laws to govern traffic
in outer space—i.e., the space
beyond the hitherto accepted
ceiling of a nation’s sovereign
territory—grows more appa-
rent ; and, as Andrew Swatkov-
sky, a graduate student of the
Russian Institute at Columbia
University (U.S.), notes in the
American magazine “Problems
of Communism,” “it is little
surprising that legal writers in
the Soviet Union, where so
much has been staked on the
development of rocketry, have
recently been giving a good
deal of attention to these
problems.”
The chief point made in
Swatkovsky’s article, which is
largely devoted to outlining
the development of Russian
views on the uses of air space
since the question first arose
(around 1912), is that Russia
has here consistently regarded
international law as “the ser-
vant of diplomacy.” This has
been particularly apparent in
Russia’s treatment of Western
proposals that outer space be
used by all nations for peaceful
purposes only:
“Since the very beginning of
the international discussions on
outer-space control, the Soviet
negotiators in the field have
received unwavering rearguard
support from the legal writers
at home, who have not hesitated
to discuss problems of the law
of cosmic space within the con-
text of the East-West arms-
race ; so much so, indeed, that
their language parallels very
closely the formulations of the
Soviet political spokesmen.
“Thus A. Galina, in an
article published in Tzvestia’ on
September 17, 1958, explained
the Soviet insistence on linking
the question of outer-space
control with the issue of
Western bases on foreign terri-
tory in the following terms:
What would happen if the
numerous military bases created by
Nato countries on foreign soil and
designated for aggressive purposes
were safeguarded while the Soviet
Union and other Socialist States
were tied down by an obligation
not to use outer space for military
purposes? This would result in
the Nato countries securing an
advantage over the Soviet Union,
which possesses an intercontinental
rocket but not such bases. This
would inflict damage on the interests
of the Soviet Union and conse-
quently on the security of all
Socialist countries.
“E. A. Korovin offered a
similar rationale:
The meaning of the U.S. pro-
posal to ‘neutralise’ the cosmos
amounts to forbidding the Soviet
intercontinental ballistic missile
and represents an attempt artificially
to single-out the intercontinental
ballistic missile from the general
context of disarmament... .By
proposing to outlaw the inter-
continental ballistic missile alone
the U.S. rulers seek to head-ott
a retaliatory blow via outer space
in the event of an atomic war,
while simultaneously retaining
numerous military bases on foreign
territories designed to attack the
Soviet Union and the peace-loving
countries friendly to it.
“A somewhat different ap-
proach was taken by G. A.
Osnitskaya in October, 1959.
Manchester “Guardian.”
“PUTTING A STOP TO THE EXCHANGE OF
FRUITLESS AND IDLE WORDS.”
At a meeting of Soviet jurists
(including Korovin and Zado-
rozhnyi) gathered in Moscow
to discuss various problems
concerning outer space, she
charged that certain groups in
the West were trying to place
outer space under the super-
vision of the United Nations in
order to retard the technologi-
cal progress of the U.S.S.R.
This plan ‘to supervise and
record the launching of sput-
niks’ was, she argued, ‘a veiled
attempt to slow - down the
development of science and
technology in our country, an
attempt to place outer space
under the control of the West
—i.e., for all intents and pur-
poses, the United States.’
“Perhaps the most succinct
statement of the present Soviet
position on outer-space control
was produced two months later
by E. A. Korovin:
Disarmament in the cosmos
cannot be separated from dis-
armament on earth. For this
reason the banning of the use of
military rockets must take place
with the simultaneous liquidation
of military bases on foreign terri-
tories and the outlawing of atomic
and hydrogen weapons. Only
with such disarmament can man-
kind be guaranteed the hope of
peace and security.
“In sum, the Soviet argu-
mentation suggests that the
U.S.S.R., convinced of its
superiority in missile develop-
ment, insists on unlimited free-
dom for its space-vehicles in
outer space to deter any pos-
sible attack against its territory
from the ring of Western bases.
“This line of reasoning, of
course, ignores the fact that the
principal reason for the estab-
lishment and maintenance of
the Western bases with their
long-range bomber-force has
been the necessity to offer an
effective deterrent to the mas-
sive Soviet land-forces which
since the conclusion of World
War II have threatened to over-
run Western Europe. Because
of geopolitical factors, a simul-
taneous elimination of the Nato
countries’ bases and Soviet mis-
siles in outer space would even
today leave the balance of
power in Europe very much in
the Soviet Union’s favor. The
right to self-defence, as the
Soviet jurists never fail to
stress, is a right inherent in
sovereignty, a condition of

“Thank goodness for that,”
the man in Perth said. “We’ve
had to put on six extra tele-
phonists to handle all the calls
we’re getting. We’ve no alter-
native but to keep broadcast-
ing all night.”
All through a night of rain
the headlights of the following
cars kept in focus Opperman’s
slight figure crouched across
his machine.
When he reached Perth next
morning Forrest Place was a
mass of cheering people.
“This is fantastic,” a commen-
tator of 6WF told his listeners.
“This crowd is even larger
than the one that turned out
to welcome the Duke and
Duchess of York!”
Tn Australia in 1936 Opper-
-*•_ man set about breaking or
establishing those inter-capital
records for which the country’s
pre-war youth probably
remember him best.
Brisbane-Sydney (651 miles),
Fremantle-Sydney (2751 miles)
and Adelaide-Sydney (1046
miles) may be rated as prob-
ably his most notable victories.
Nearly a quarter of a century
after he made them, all these
inter-capital records still stand.
The Fremantle - Sydney
marathon was an epic of
endurance which captured the
imagination of all Australia.
In breaking the existing record
by 6 days 8 hours 21 minutes,
he also toppled 11 inter-
mediate records on the way
across the continent. Radio-
newsmen, accompanying him,
broadcast his progress. From
villages, towns and cities
people lined the roads to cheer
him on.
The police of Adelaide and
Melbourne were hard put to
control the crowds that jostled
to welcome him and to un-
tangle the traffic-snarls that
gathered in his-wake.
In Melbourne Parliamen-
tary business was suspended
while the entire House, led by
Premier Dunstan, came out to
watch him go through.
Even though he arrived in
Sydney’s Martin Place about
11-o’clock at night there were
thousands to greet him. Next
day Lord Mayor Howie pre-
sided at a civic reception
Sydney put on for him.
Opperman lost exactly one-
stone in weight on that epic
ride. But a Sydney doctor,
evidently a precursor of Pro-
fessor Cotton, subjected him
to a searching medical
examination and pronounced
that here was “a complete
picture of the perfectly trained
athlete, without any strain
whatsoever.”
T|y 1939 they were saying
that Opperman had
passed his peak, but he silenced
his critics, and surprised even
his most ardent admirers, by
breaking the world’s 24-hour
unpaced road-record. In mak-
ing this record, which still
stands, he covered an
incredible 505| miles in the
time it took the clock to go
round twice.
Two months later, as he
entered his 20th year as a pro-
fessional cyclist, he broke 101
N.S.W., Australian and world
records in 24 hours, at the old
Sydney Sports Arena. By any
standard it was a remarkable'
effort —the supreme effort of
a champion who, wanting at
the time to get into uniform,
probably realised that this, at
last, was the end of the road.
At 37 he joined the R.A.A.F.
as an aircraftsman, and was
instantly nabbed as a physical-
training and drill instructor.
Promoted to the rank of ser-
geant, he was later com-
missioned and finished the war
as flight-lieutenant, Adjutant
of 13 A.R.D. at Breddan,
Queensland.
On demobilisation, Opper-
man rejoined the Bruce Small
organisation as director in
charge of personnel and
public - relations. Following
the five-year war-time break
he made a brief two-years’
comeback in which he raced
from the scratch-mark and
broke local motor - paced
records.
Within a few years, although
he was not to know it, he
was to be caught-up in the
hurly-burly of politics.

ijob on which Menzies
Opperman should cut
plical teeth was as chair-
's of the sporting sub-
site in the Jubilee Year
of 1950. The enthusiasm with
which he applied himself to
that job, plus political in-
experience, combined to cause
him to commit the error of not
consolidating his ground in an
electorate that had sent him to
Canberra with the barest
majority.
When, after only 16 months
in office, Menzies moved for
his double-dissolution in 1951
Opperman was one sitting
member who was unprepared
for a quick election.
His opponent was again the
formidable Dedman, who,
still smarting from his un-
expected defeat, had zealously
campaigned to regain his
ground.
It was a hard, bitterly
fought election, but, although
Dedman reduced his oppo-
nent’s slender lead, his effort
was not great enough. Opper-
man emerged the winner with
a precarious majority of 139
votes.
He had learnt his lesson.
During the next term he spent
as much time as he could
manage in keeping his relation-
ship with the constituents of
Corio in good repair. In the
election of 1954 he increased
his lead to 1216 votes. Ded-
man, again the loser, and no
doubt considering third time
proved it, shrugged his despair
and quit the hustings for ever.
"Dack in Canberra, Opper-
" man became Deputy
Whip to the capable, if
irascible, Joe Gullett, serving
an apprenticeship that was to
stand him in good stead when,
the following year, Gullett
told the party a few home
truths and got out of politics.
When the great Labor
schism broke in 1955 Menzies
was presented with the heaven-
sent opportunity of increasing
the Liberal majority. Not
only did Menzies subscribe to
the belief that a house divided
against itself must fall, he was
statesman enough to know
that the warring factions on
the other side of the House,
representing no Opposition at
all, were inimical to good
. government. He wanted the
electors to be given the oppor-
tunity of clearing the unwhole-
some atmosphere permeating
the Lower House. In the dual
role of astute politician and
altruistic statesman, he went
to the polls for what was to
prove a pushover. The
Liberals were returned with
record majorities.
Down in Corio,* Opperman,
facing his constituents for the
fourth time in seven years, had
his task made easier by Labor
and D.L.P. candidates brawl-
ing in bitter opposition. He
won by 5844 votes, to-date the
high-water mark of his five
victories in that electorate.
With Gullett out, Opper-
man was the logical choice for
Whip, a job that suited exactly
one who placed such a high
value on team-work. It was
his ability to promote the
interests of the party, rather
than his own, that led Artie
Fadden, upon a time, to aver
that Opperman was the best
Whip the House had known
since Federation.
has never lost
interest in the sport that
brought him fame. There was
a time when he tried to keep
his colleagues, on both sides
of the House, in good physical
shape by organising a pool of
bicycles from which they
might draw for business and
social excursions about the
capital. He even offered to
give them lessons. In a
brotherhood where gold-passes
permit less strenuous methods
of travel, however, the project
was doomed to failure. He
had to go it alone.
Recently, from their Gee-
long home, he and his wife
decided to spend an afternoon
on the beach at Torquay.
Opperman, obeying an instinct
that he finds as strong now as
he did in the far-distant
Melton days, decided he would
cycle down.
On the way he came across
a group of girls, evidently on
a cycling tour, walking their
machines towards the crest of
a long hill. He pedalled to
them in an effortless manner.
They stopped to watch him,
not recognising that the spry
figure hunched over the
handle-bars was that of the
greatest road-cyclist of them
all.
As he passed them he
saluted.
“Hi, Pop!” one girl called.
Opperman smiled as he
reached the crest and set-off
on the down-grade. He
thought that, as a cyclist, he
was over the hill. “I must be
getting old,” he thought.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Cure for Dog Menace
While people allow un-
wanted pups to live and are
callous about what happens to
dogs when they have outgrown
the infant’s-pet stage we will
always have the killer-dog
problem. Registration of dogs
(“Wimra”: B. 10/8/’6O) will
not stop raids on sheep,
although after the damage is
done the sheep-owner may be
able to obtain redress from the
dog-owner, if he can trace
him.
In N.S.W. the Dog and
Goat Act of 1898 and the
Local Government Act (Sec-
tion 249 a) give ample power
to police and private persons
to destroy straying dogs, but
few people would take advan-
tage of these Acts merely to
destroy an apparently owner-
less dog.
We must recognise that we
can’t blame the dog; he is
among the most helpless of
all domesticated animals in
that he relies on man for his
food and drink. I’ve had a
dog that would kill and bring
a rabbit to my feet, not
attempting to eat it until I had
returned it to him.
The answer to the straying-
dog problem lies in educating
dog - owners. In Albury
(N.S.W.), J. Valiukas, a new-
comer from overseas who
knew nothing of the sheep-
man’s troubles, opened a
voluntary dog-obedience school
with the purpose of keeping
dogs off the streets and of
showing adults and children
how to treat a dog intelli-
gently.
The idea was taken up
enthusiastically, and for an
hour every Sunday morning
classes were held at the show-
ground. The dogs were of all
kinds, and some were the
progeny of “the 10 best dogs
in town.”
Soon almost every dog-
owner in Albury became con-
scious that any dog could be
taught to heel, sit, lie, walk
fast or slow, jump, wait, stay,
go away or come at call.
Valiukas has shown us that
the well-fed dog will not stray,
“Yours faithfully, Beauchamp—B-E-A-U-C- ”
and that he can be a good
companion.
It goes without saying that
a killer-dog must be destroyed ;
__ but fewer dogs would become
strays if country kennel-clubs
started dog-obedience schools.
They are good for the dogs,
and the exercise does the
owners no harm.
Valiukas first took an
interest in dogs when he was
bitten by an Alsatian: he
wanted to find the reason.
Now he and his Alsatian are
a star-turn at the Albury
Show, where members of the

Council Revenue Plan
Local - government organisa-
tions, particularly in country
districts, are desperately short
of finance to provide the ser-
vices and amenities citizens
need and demand.
Rising costs are hitting muni-
cipal and shire councils hard,
and they can get no revenue,
apart from rates. But the rate-
level can become too high, and
has reached that stage in some
areas.
It is unfair that property-
owners should be forced to
provide funds for services and
amenities enjoyed by all resi-
dents ; but , owners pay the
rates, although many of them
are on incomes nowhere near
those earned by others who
contribute exactly nothing to
council funds.
The Blue Mountains (N.S.W.)
City Council has come up with
a proposal that has merit —to
impose a tax of 2s. a week on
all who pay Federal income-
tax, the total pool to be dis-
tributed to councils on a popu-
lation basis.
This, of course, would mean
that ratepayers would have to
contribute a little more, but it
would bring in the many others
who now escape any payment.
The plan could end a lot of
headaches /or some councils. —-

Tasmanian Dentistry
It is essential to correct the
misleading letters of I. W.
Smith and “Prorsum et Semper
Honeste” dealing with the
licensing of Tasmanian dental
mechanics (B. 20/7/’6O).
Prices charged by Tasmanian
mechanics are very little, if at
all, lower than fees assessed by
dentists for normal functional
dentures. In fact, there are
cases where the mechanics’
prices are higher.
Whether or not amounts paid
to mechanics are allowable tax-
deductions is a matter between
the taxpayer and the taxing
authorities ; it is no concern of
the Australian Dental Associa-
tion, which has been unfairly
accused of diserw .
this respect. ® mat| oii ii

Powers of Councils
A recent judgment of the
High Court in Sydney on the
powers of councils to refuse
ratepayers the right to inspect
books-of-account relating to
particular funds was of wide
interest to ratepayers generally.
Following the disastrous
bushfires on the Blue Moun-
tains in 1958 the Blue Moun-
tains City Council took-over
the administration of a bush-
fire relief-fund; and when a
local ratepayer objected to the
way the fund was being admini-
stered and was subsequently
refused the right to inspect the
books dealing with it, he
proceeded against the town-
clerks the deputy town-clerk
and the city - treasurer for
allegedly refusing to make the
books available to him, claim-
ing it was a breach of the Local
Government Act.
A magistrate dismissed the
information, holding that the
words “make an inspection” as
used in section 217 did not
envisage the making of notes
or copies of the records as the
ratepayer sought to do.
The Supreme Court upheld
this decision. The ratepayer,
Everard C. Downey, who was
elected an alderman of the
council in December last, then
appealed to the High Court,
which, by a majority of two
to one, allowed the appeal and
ordered that the magistrate’s
determination be set aside and
that the question stated by the
magistrate for the opinion of
the Supreme Court—whether
his determination that the in-
formation be dismissed was
erroneous in law —be answered
“yes.” The High Court then
ordered that the matter be
remitted to the magistrate for
determination accordingly.
The chairman of the bush-
fire fund at the time it was first
challenged was also mayor ’of
the municipality and was widely
respected throughout the whole
area. There was never any
suggestion that dissatisfaction
with the administration of the
fund in any way reflected on
the mayor’s honesty or that of
any of those associated with
him.
A principle was at stake,
however, and ratepayers felt
that only a ruling by the
highest court in the land could
finally resolve the rights and
obligations of the parties to the
dispute. This has now been
given.— Peter Simple (N.S.W.).
The P-bomb
What H. E. Graves sees
happening in Tasmania (B.
3/8/’6O) is only a sample of
what is happening all over the
world. As the population
grows, demanding more land
to grow food, we are busy
building over much of our very
best land to provide these extra
mouths with places to live,
work and travel.
Everyone over 30 must be
able to remember productive
farms where now there are
houses, factories, roads and
airfields. The U.S. is losing a
million acres a year this way ;
and, because people naturally
congregate in fertile areas,
most of it is good land. It has
been forecast that on present
trends the U.S. will have a
thousand - million mouths to
feed by a.d. 2050, and that a
large and rich area of the
eastern States, reaching west to
Detroit and Pittsburgh, will be
virtually a continuous urban

area. A thousand-million, in-
cidentally, was the estimated
population of the whole of
Asia only about 30 years ago.
Much though we may hate
the thought of regimentation,
it is hard to see what can be
done without very strict Gov-
ernment control on the lines
of high-density housing and
perhaps the moving of cities to
infertile areas. In any case, if
we continue to multiply, that
would ortfy put off the day of
reckoning. If we applied to the
full our present agricultural
knowledge, we could probably
feed adequately the world’s
present population, but not
very much more. The really
logical solution would be to
stabilise the world’s population
at its present level, allowing
further planned expansion as
food-production techniques im-
prove —for example, reclaiming
deserts or farming the oceans.
This is no mere pipe-dream ;
our knowledge appears to be
nearing the point where it
would be technically feasible.
But what Government could
encourage, or even permit,
such a policy in the present
state of world affairs while any
one of its neighbors was free
to multiply unchecked? And,
as it would require enforce-
ment, who would care to trust
public servants with such
tremendous power over our
private lives?
In the meantime, while
politicians wrangle fruitlessly
about the control of nuclear
bombs, ordinary men and
women everywhere are steadily
building a population - bomb
that could, in due course, blow
civilisation to smithereens. —-
Magnoon (Q.).
Poker-machines
It’s refreshing to learn that
action is being taken in several
N.S.W. country towns to launch
a campaign for the abolition of
2s. poker - machines. These
machinees are great revenue-
spinners for clubs, but they are
bleeding the economy of the
towns concerned.
In one town of less than
10,000 population, figures were
produced to show that 2s.
poker-machines in three local
clubs were grossing £68,000
annually. Take that amount of
spending - money out of any
community, and a lot of people
will go short, including the
families of the gamblers as well
as all sections of business.
Poker-machines of all values
can artificially create depres-
sions in the centres they oper-
ate in. And it is amazing that
businessmen are usually leaders
in the clubs that have installed
them —an example of extra-
ordinary shortsightedness.
Business will be better,
families will have more to
spend and the whole com-
munity will benefit when the
“Flight-engineer reporting — landing-wheels down at
last, sir!”
machines are banned. Sam
Square (N.S.W.).
Inaccurate News
The French Government’s,
decision to introduce a new
form of press-censorship by
making it an offence to publish
inaccurate news poses a new
problem for newspapers.
It is undeniable that a lot of
inaccurate news is printed and
broadcast every day throughout
the world, but it would be un-
fair to lay the whole blame for
this on newspapers and news-
agencies.
As every reporter knows, it
is often extremely difficult to
guarantee the accuracy of any
news-story, simply because the
sources from which news is
obtained are themselves often
responsible, perhaps quite un-
intentionally, for serious in-
accuracies.
Even official sources cannot
always be relied on. I remem-
ber reading a House of Com-
mons debate before World War
II in which a member asked
the then Prime Minister (Bald-
win) if it were not a fact that
items in the British Official
Wireless, which was compiled
by the Foreign Office, were not
sometimes so written as to
clothe them with two entirely
different meanings. Baldwin
merely smiled in reply.
It was well known during
the war that official reports
issued by both sides were some-
times deliberately misleading,
the excuse being J;hat such re-
ports were put out in an effort
to “draw” the other side. I recall
that the day before the Queen
Mary arrived in Sydney for the
first time the A.B.C. broadcast
a report, taken from the British
Official Wireless, that she had
berthed in Capetown the previ-
ous day. The object, of course,
was to mislead the enemy as to
her whereabouts.
Even crime-reports issued by
the police are at times deliber-
ately misleading in some par-
ticular, the aim being to trap
a suspected criminal into
making a move which would
land him in the police net.
I doubt if a reporter ever
deliberately falsifies his copy
except by direction, but news-
papers are not entirely free
from blame in the publication
of inaccurate news. It is not
so much that they write some-
thing misleading into a story
as that they leave some im-
portant fact out. This happens
most frequently, I should say,
in the publication of political
items.
The answer to a charge of
falsifying a story by omitting
some important fact is that
there was not space for a full
report; and in the process of
sub-editing some points were
deleted which the author may
have regarded as vital but
which the sub-editor a
were of minor i mpo[tlt S
The courts have held that a
accurate report does no n!
sanly have to be aM , «
but to be accurate it

Preparation of such
often requires a goo d ™

TH E MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'S WORRY I'M SENDIN IT TO
GRAZCOS."
THE CHEVIOT
From JOHN LYNE
(Federal President, Cheviot Sheep-breeders’ Association of Aust.)
r T' , HE Cheviot, one of Britain’s
oldest breeds of sheep,
was first introduced into Aus-
tralia in 1938 by H. B. Walsh
and Son, of Mount Barker
(S.A.).
The Cheviots, a range of
cone-shaped hills on the border
of England and Scotland, gave
the breed its name.
When, in 1791, the British
Wool Society was established,
and delegates were appointed
to visit various centres and
report on type and merits of
different species of sheep, Sir
John Sinclair, leading
authority, toured the English
Border-country and found a
breed which he considered
ideally adapted to the High-
lands. He named this breed
the Cheviot, and strongly
recommended its use in other
districts. After the turn of
the 18th century the breed
spread throughout southern
Scotland and by 1860 had
Russia has been re-
"piaced by the United
States as the biggest
buyer of Uruguayan
wool. Russia pur-
chased no wool in the
first five months of the
season compared with
23,200 bales in the
same period of the
previous year. As
Soviet trade has re-
commenced with Aus-
tralia, this possibly has
had some bearing on
this development.
Australian growers have
proved, that lamb mor-
tality can be kept to
a minimum by the use
of Elastrator Robber
Rings. The Elastrator
method is the blood-
less, humane method
of castrating and tail-
ing that considerably
reduces the risk of
disease, setback and
fly-strike.
practically deposed the Black-
face from all the best farms,
except those in mountainous
areas where heath took the
place of grass.
Advances in the develop-
ment of cloth-manufacture
showed that no wool could
compare with the Cheviot in
“A helluva row this morning—caught the wife
stringing the beans with my axe!”
producing those durable
tweeds with which the Border-
towns of Selkirk, Galashiels
and Hawick built a reputation
that persists today.
After steady improvement
in the present century the
Cheviot gained considerably
in demand. At the Hawick
sale in 1920 a shearling ram
bred by John Elliot, of Black-
haugh, sold for £l2OO. On
many occasions top rams have
made to £lOOO at both Hawick
and Locherie.
In its native land the Cheviot
has become famous for cross-
ing. There, through crossing
the Border Leicester ram with
the Cheviot ewe, the world-
renowed half-bred has been
produced—the most prolific
sheep known, the best of
mothers, and for generations
the rent-payer of the British
farmer.
Although the breed is
mainly used for crossing, the
pure Cheviot-lamb carcass has
many times taken top honors
in carcass-competitions at
Smithfield.
Owing to its hardiness and
ability to thrive in every kind
of climate and conditions, the
Cheviot has been exported to
all parts of the world.
Cheviots in Australia
For 17 years after its intro-
duction to Australia the
Cheviot made slow progress.
During this time many leading
breeders of today consoli-
dated their flock-foundation
by rigid culling. By 1955
commercial breeders were
beginning to note the numer-
ous successes of the Cheviot
in this country. These suc-
cesses were gained as a sire
of fat lambs and as a crossing
sheep—Cheviot rams were
mated with Merino, Polwarth
or Corriedale ewes, and pro-
duced an ideal fat-lamb
mother, which inherited fer-
tility and milking-ability from
the Cheviot.

A Cheviot’s carriage is very

is close, fine and free from

Scottish and New Zealand
breeders seek a fleece of 50’s
to 56’s quality, but under Aus-
tralian conditions the count
could be more accurately
defined as 56’s to 50’s quality.
The fact that the Cheviot
has proved its worth in this
country in only 20 years
leaves little doubt that it will
take its place among the great
breeds of sheep in Australia.
The Meyer Lemon
“H.W.L.W.”: In Queens-
land growers of the Meyer
lemon are concerned at reports
that the N.S.W. Department of
Agriculture is seeking to re-
classify it as a fruit other than
a lemon.
Botanically, it is not recog-
nised as a true lemon. Although
its parentage is of doubtful
origin, it is said to be a hybrid
between the lemon (Citrus
limon) and some other species
of citrus, possibly the sweet
orange (C. sinensis).
In common with a number
of citrus species and varieties,
the Meyer lemon originated in
Asia, where it was found grow-
ing as an ornamental potted
plant at Fengtai, near Peking.
Its potentialities were recog-
nised by Frank N. Meyer, agri-
cultural explorer of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture,
who introduced it to America
in 1908.
Since its introduction to
Queensland in 1944 by the late
W. E. Wilson, of Redland Bay,
plantings have steadily in-
creased, and in the Redlands
area well over 10,000 trees are
now established.
Those who oppose the Meyer
claim that its acid-content is
lower than that of the Lisbon
types; but it is much the
juiciest of all lemons and has
distinctive flavor. Because its
main crop ripens in the sum-
mer, when drinks are in greater
demand, it should become in-
creasingly popular.
Another point of criticism is
that the fruit is often more
orange than lemon in color, but
this can easily be avoided if the
fruit is picked at full maturity
and gas-colored. This ensures
that only sound fruit is
marketed, as any defect is soon
apparent in the ripening-room ;
also, the fact that the fruit is
harvested before reaching full
color lessens the chance of in-
festation from fruit-fly in the
orchard.
Experience gained in the
Redlands area shows that,
although the Meyer is readily
adaptable to many soil-types,
the hbavy red soils there pro-
duce an excellent lemon with
first-class qualities for keep-
ing and carrying. As such the
Meyer will still command an
important place in the inter-
state trade.
Used Tractors
“Bilwon”: Before reaching
for your cheque-book when
buying a used tractor check
all moving parts and make
sure the king-pins are not
worn. Check front and rear
wheel-bearings for wear; you
will have to jack the tractor up
to do this, but don’t begrudge
the time —bearings are expen-
sive. If the owner refuses to
jack-up the unit, let him keep
it. He probably has a good
reason for not wanting to —a
reason that may cost you any-
thing up to £2O.
Pay particular attention to
the gearbox and see if there is
excessive play in the gear-
change lever. If in doubt, take
the top off. Always ask per-
mission first, of course, but if
it is refused, drop the sale like
a hot brick. There’s a lot of
money tied-up in a gearbox-
overhaul,
You can’t thoroughly check
the gearbox unless you start
the tractor. With the engine
running, see if you can change
gears without clashing them,
Keep an ear cocked for whining
bearings or grating gears. A
“click-click-click” in a particu-
lar gear generally indicates that
it is warped or chipped. It may
not be serious at the time, but
it may get worse. While the
engine is running, listen for
knocks.
Tappet-chatter can be recti-
fled by resetting the tappet-
clearances. Engine-knocks are
more serious. They may indi-
cate major and costly replace-
ments.
Once the engine has warmed-
up, check the oil-pressure. If
the needle on the gauge flutters
badly it may indicate worn
bearings, a faulty oil-pump or
a defective gauge,
Excessive smoke from the
exhaust is a sign that the engine
is burning oil or that the mix-
ture is too rich. Ask the
owner to adjust the carburettor,
so that a cleaner mixture is fed
into the chambers. If the ex-
haust still smokes, you can be
sure the engine is chewing oil.
Rev.-up the engine, then
throttle back to a fast idling
speed. If the motor runs un-
evenly it may be a sign of

excessive wear in the cylinders.
Piston-slap will be heard as the
revs, are steadily increased.
Make sure the lights work
properly. At the same time
check the wiring—you can get
a fair idea of the way the unit
has been handled by the state
of the wiring; the insulated
covering will be cracked and
perished if the unit has been
left out in the sun and rain.
If the tractor is rubber-shod,
check the tyres carefully. See
if they have been retreaded.
Sometimes a weak-walled tyre
is retreaded just to make a sale
by giving the buyer the impres-
sion that the machine is well-
shod. Examine the lower parts
of the wall for signs of cracks
and weathering. This will give
a rough idea of whether the
casing is sound. A thick
covering of rubber over a weak
wall will soon lead to a blown
tyre.
General appearance of the
rest of the machinery on the
farm will sometimes give a
lead as to the condition of the
tractor offered for sale —most
farmers treat all machinery
alike. But you can’t beat
making a thorough check your-
self.
Shearing School
“Jock”: In order to provide
a regular flow of shearers into
the wool industry, Lockhart
(N.S.W.) Pastoral and Agri-
cultural Society recently organ-
ised its sixth annual shearing-
school.
Twenty students are enrolled,
their ages ranging from 16 to
24 years, and they come from
as far away as Cooma and
Parkes. C. Rap 1 e y has
charge of shearing-operations,
and Arthur Clark, sheep- and
wool-officer with the Depart-
ment of Agriculture at Wagga,
looks after wool-instruction.
All sheep shorn come from
the property of Gooden
Brothers, Glenroy, and are one-
year-olds carrying lengthy
fleece. This year 367 applica-
tions were received, but the list
was trimmed to 20 to allow
efficient individual instruction.
In six years the school has
taught 100 students.
Cotton
Queensland’s 1960 cotton-
crop is expected to be the
second-largest in the State’s
history. The largest yield was
in 1934, when 17,500 bales were
harvested from 70,000 acres ;
this year 56,000 acres should
produce about 15,000 bales
double the yield of 1959.
The main centre of cotton-
growing is swinging from cen-
tral to southern districts, with
its biggest development on the
Darling Downs, where new
areas around Dalby, Miles,
Wandoan, Jandowae and St.
George are assuming real im-
portance. Acreages around
Tara and Condamine on the
Western Downs, in the Bunda-
berg district and at Cooktown
and Herberton in the far north
are also being greatly increased.
Experimental plots in these
districts have provided some
interesting figures. Trial-areas
planted in October at the Her-
mitage Research Station gave
a return of £B7 an acre, the
average yield being 15001 b. an
acre. Picking-costs of 4d. a
pound reduced the return to
£62 10s. an acre —far better
than any other summer-growing
crop.
A Tara man who planted
four acres as an experiment
received £lOO an acre from his
crop, while at Condamine,
further west, an area of slightly
over half-an-acre yielded £6O.
Both crops were rain-grown,
and their results have en-
couraged other farmers to plant
cotton instead of the usual
summer crops, prices of which
are depressed and uncertain,
while the price of cotton is
guaranteed at Is. 2d. a pound
at growers’ sidings.

REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(11/8/’60)
Queensland should have moderate rain along part of
the coast and on the central highlands in September, though
the rest of the State may have only light falls, generally
below normal. Rainfall will probably be poor during
October, but better throughout the State in November,
except along the central coast, on the Peninsula and in the
north-west and far-west districts, where falls may be poor.
N.S.W. will probably have light rains, generally below
normal, in September, with better falls on part of the
Southern Tablelands, South-west Slopes and Riverina.
During October there should be moderate rains along the
coast and on the tableland, but only light falls elsewhere.
General rains should follow in November, with best falls in
the northern divisions.
Victoria should have reasonably good rains in Sep-
tember, with best falls in the north-eastern districts and
along the west coast, and' light to moderate rain in East
Gippsland. Light patchy rains should follow in October and
November.
South Australia should have good rains in the agricul-
tural areas and along the west coast in September, but
only light falls in the interior. There should be light to
moderate patchy rains in the agricultural areas in October
and November.
In Western Australia there are likely to be good rains
in the s.-w. agricultural areas and about the Gascoyne
during September, with light to moderate rains in the
south-eastern districts. Elsewhere rainfall looks like being
poor.

Experiments in sowing show
that a grain-combine set to
plant 2201 b. of wheat an acre
will sow approximately 201 b. of
cotton an acre.
Usual depth for sowing is
from lyin to 2in. Depth of sow-
ing is important, and the com-
bine-tines, floats and depth-
controls should be thoroughly
checked to ensure accuracy.
However good the machine, a
thorough test is needed before
planting, and a constant check
should be maintained to ensure
good, even plant-stands.
If rain falls after planting in
soils that form a hard, thick
crust before the seedlings are
through, it is best to.re-plant
immediately. Where only a
light crust is formed it can
usually be broken by harrows
or other implements to allow
young plants to come through
satisfactorily.
Miller 43-9-0 is the most
suitable variety for growing in
both irrigated and rain-grown
areas where mechanical-pickers
are used.
The worst pest of cotton is
the corn-ear worm (Heliothis
armigera). The moth lays
eggs on the leaves, and the
emerging larvae feed on the
young leaves. The pest feeds on
other host-plants. Pigweeds of
various species, twin-leaf, wild
cape-gooseberry, bullshead and
several allied weeds are all
attacked, enabling the worm to
survive until cotton begins to
square.
Therefore all weeds must be
kept in check, not only in the
fields but in adjacent areas.
Old cultivation - paddocks in
the vicinity should be ploughed
early in spring to destroy sur-
viving pupae.
Growers should examine
their crops for eggs of the pest
four weeks after the beginning
of squaring and weekly for the
next eight weeks, selecting 25
terminals from various parts of
the field. When the number
of eggs exceeds seven in the
25 terminals control-measures
should begin. Arsenate-of-lead
powder should be applied at
the rate of 81b. to 151 b. an acre
or 15gals. to 25gals. of spray
an acre. Spraying with D.D.T.
emulsion at the rate of lgal. to
2j acres is also effective.
Many farmers already own
most of the machinery needed
for cultivation of cotton —they
must have sundercuts, scari-
fiers and combines to work
their paddocks—so the crop
does not call for a great cash-
outlay. Where a number of
farmers grow a concentrated
area the Cotton Board will
supply a mechanical-harvester
to do the picking and so keep
machinery-costs at bedrock.
Trials have shown that best
yields come from using cotton
as a first crop after ploughed-
up grassland. After three or
four years under cotton, land
should be turned over to
Rhodes-grass, green-panic or
buffel - grass for the same
period. Grasses do well on old
cotton-land, and these pastures,
when ripped-up, grow big crops
of cotton.

Ram-sale and Show
“Wimra”: For 11 years the
small western Victorian centre
of Goroke has held annual
ram-sales, at which prices have
rarely risen above 500gns.—
indeed many do not exceed
25gns. This year few high-
priced rams were sold, and
even fewer low-priced ones.
Poor bidding for the first
lots, offered by a new stud,
apparently dampened enthusi-
asm for the rest of the sale ; but
breeders were not dismayed.
Theirs being a show as well as
a sale, they were confident that
when prospective buyers who
knew what they wanted to build
their flocks on a selected line
failed later to get anything as
good at higher prices they
would come back to buy.
All, whether buyers or not,
who enjoyed the hospitality of
Pleasant will look for-
ward to a return visit to Goroke
ram-sales next July.
Farm Hint
“Buzz-buzz”: Winter is the
time to buy new frames for
your bees. Assemble them and
put the foundation in. Frames
are always in scarce supply in
October, when they are needed.
All old frames and useless
comb want boiling clean and
remaking ready for the season.
Empty boxes may need to be
repainted and repaired, and all
other equipment should be
checked.

Would a person with an income
from Commonwealth bonds need a
guarantor to get a tax-clearance if
he were going to reside permanently
in the U.K. ? Are there any
restrictions on the amount of money
one can send to the U.K.?
A person with an income from
Commonwealth bonds would cer-
tainly need a guarantor unless he
could make some arrangement with
the Income Tax Department. The
restrictions on the transfer of
money to the United Kingdom are
restrictions on the type and pur-
pose of the money rather than the
amount. For instance, there is
usually no trouble in transferring
portions of estates to beneficiaries,
making gifts or transferring money
in the ordinary course of business.
There are, however, restrictions
on sending capital funds out of
the country. The exact extent of
these restrictions can be obtained
from any banker.

What is the origin of the Labrador
retriever breed of dog ? What are
some of its uses ?
As with many breeds the origin
cannot be definitely established.
But it is certain that as the fishing
industry increased in Labrador a
breed was established of which
there were two types. One was
larger, stronger and long-haired,
and the other lighter and smooth-
coated. The former were used as
draught animals to pull sleighs and
for general work, and the latter
as retrievers of fish and game.
Both types were taken to England,
where they were known as New-
foundland dogs. The two were
distinguished about 1812-14, when
the larger was called the New-
foundland and the smaller the
Labrador. Since then there has
been little change in the standard
of the breed.
Mainly known as a retriever, the
Labrador is in fact very versatile.
It can be trained as a pet, as a
watch-dog, as a guard-dog, and is
increasingly used as a seeing-eye-
dog. Recently they have been
shown able to work with sheep.

What is the history of the
Vlamingh Plate ? Is it kept in
Canberra or Perth ?
When Dirck Hartog, in 1616,
landed on the island off the west
coast that now bears his name he
erected a post and affixed a plaque
to it to commemorate his visit. In
February of 1697 another Dutch
voyager, Willem de Vlamingh,
landed on the island and discovered
the plaque. This he took away
and left another plaque, or plate,
which commemorated both Hartog’s
visit and his own. The Hartog
plate was taken *to Amsterdam,
where it is still kept in the Rijks-
museum, but the Vlamingh plate
remained on the island for 120
years until it was removed by a
French expedition led by Louis de
Freycinet and taken to Paris.
There it was put on view, but it
was mislaid and not discovered
until 1940, when the French
Government presented it to the
Australian Government. The plate
arrived in Australia in 1947, but
the National Library had to send
it back to England to have it
restored. It was then placed on

Brief Answers
J.T.M.: Tuggerah: cold; Terri-
gal: place of little birds;
Munmurra (?): moon-blind native.
E.W.: Ulladulla grew up as a
shipping-point for cedar and other
timbers in the late 1820’s. One
of the earliest settlers was the
Rev. Thomas Kendall, grand-
father of the poet Henry Kendall.
J.A.L.: Lalla Rookh’s name
was Truganini. It was the fifth
of her husbands, William Lanne,
who was the last Tasmanian
aboriginal male, just as she was
the last female H.J.L.: The
first Australian-built deep-sea
whaler was the 180-ton King
George, launched in 1805....
K.8.P.: In 1916 the Imperial Wool
Purchase Scheme was instituted.
The British Government, in order
to safeguard wool supplies for the
remainder of the war, and to deny
supplies to the enemy, established
a bulk-purchase scheme under
which it agreed to buy the Aus-
tralian wool-clips for the remaining
war-time period and for one year
after at a price of a pound.
Similar arrangements were made
with New Zealand, and later, with
South Africa. The British Govern-
ment shared equally with the Aus-
tralian woolgrowers the profits from
resale of wool in excess of war
requirements. These profits aver-

Ballet Suites
It seems inevitable, in the
recording world, that when
“Swan Lake” is put to rotating
in the microgrooves its running-
mate is the same composer’s
“Sleeping Beauty.” And there
is logic in it, too. Both suites
are approximately the same
length ; both derive from fairy-
tales, and share the pre-
ponderance of waltz-time ; both
are replete with wonderful
melodies ; and both, with the
pulsations of the dance in each
case, are touched with a gentle
melancholy. The performance
on the latest disk shared by the
celebrated pair is a first-class
one by the Warsaw National
Philharmonic Orchestra under
Witold Rowicki. It is from
Deutsche Gesselschaft (LPEM
19201).

Operetta
Die Fledermaus is probably
the most sparkling of Johann
Strauss’s operettas and Decca’s
Ace of Clubs collection of its
highlights (ACLA 73) captures
the gaiety and tunefulness of
the Viennese masquerade very
well. There could be no ex-
cuse if it didn’t do so, since
its cast of front-rank German
singers is backed by the Vienna
Philharmonic Orchestra (con-
ducted by Clemens Krauss) and
the chorus of the Vienna State
Opera. Anton Dermota, who
plays Alfred, made a concert-
tour of Australia a few years
ago. His fine tenor voice
is heard to good effect in his
serenade to Rosalinde (“Taub-
chen, das entflattert ist”) and
in the drinking-song at the end
of Act One. Julius Patzak
(Eisenstein) and Alfred Poell
(Dr. Falke) are the other chief
male singers ; Hilde Gueden
plays the wayward wife Rosa-
linde and Wilma Lipp the
flighty maid Adele.

Levant Again
In Some Pleasant Moments
in the 20th Century, which
comes from Coronet (KLL 596)
pianist Oscar Levant puts eight
near - modern and modern
pieces together and plays them
in the Levant manner—muscu-
lar pianism touched at odd
spots with poetry but revelling
in music of pungency and
punch. There is a neat balance
struck between all sections.
For delicacy there are the
lushly melodious 18th Varia-
tion from Rachmaninoff’s
“Rhapsody on a Theme of
Paganini,” and pieces from
Debussy’s “Children’s Corner”
and Ravel’s “Tomb of Cou-
perin,” and the latter’s “Pavane
for a Dead Infanta.” The
Polka from Shostakovitch’s
“Age of Gold” and Proko-
fieff’s “Vision Fugitive” supply
pungency and wit with a dash
of dissonance. Cyril Scott’s
“Lotus Land” and Mompou’s
“Scenes of Childhood” add a
nutty flavor.

Hibernian Junketings
Films, radio, TV and Tin
Pan Alley have made New
York’s St. Patrick’s Day parade
so world renowned that one
tends to forget that the festival
rightly belongs to Ould Oire-
land. St. Patrick’s Night in
Dublin (CLP 1331), latest in
H.M.V.’s “Music of the World”
series, sets out to right this
wrong. The recording is not a
rehearsed affair ; it was taken
on tape at the Irish Club in
Parnell Square, Dublin, on
March 17 last year and is put
forward as the first recording
ever made of “the sounds of a
St. Patrick’s Day celebration in
Ireland.”
The sounds are the lilting
music of Brendan Hogan’s Bal-
linakill Ceili Band in a pro-
gramme of jigs, waltzes and
barn-dances, with occasional
vocals and an authentic back-
ground of chatter and laughter.
One of the dances, the quaintly-
named “Walls of Limerick,”
doesn’t seem to have migrated
to these parts. It sounds a
lively frolic and is danced to
such ditties as “Bag of Pota-
toes,” “Master McDermott”
and “Cooley’s Reel.”

A Mixed Grill
The ghosts of Messrs. Beet-
hoven, Grieg, Schumann and
co. will sardonically, lift an
eyebrow if they happen to hear
The World’s Ten Most Popu-
lar Piano Concertos, a Warner
Bros, disk (W 1249), and not
only because their own ex-
positions are excluded. For it’s
a motley collection, with only
one of the 10 true to name—
the “Warsaw Concerto.” There
are strange bedfellows: “The
Swedish Rhapsody” rubs
shoulders with Terry's Theme
from Chaplin’s film “Lime-
light” ; “Cornish Rhapsody” is
cheek-by-jowl with “Slaughter
On 10th Avenue.” And the
pianist, George Greeley, who
arranged them and plays them
with Warner Bros. Orchestra,
has even managed to squeeze-in
Chopin’s A Flat Polonaise—
which would raise quite a
shudder from the ghost of the
fastidious Pole for the weird
treatment to which that famous
and strictly solo piano-piece has
been subjected both in the
orchestral arranging and the
solo playing.

Gershwin
Another addition to R.C.A.’s
Camden “paperbacks” is a
George Gershwin album (CAM

“Concerto in F.” Both pieces
are presented by the Boston
Pops Orchestra under the baton
of Arthur Fiedler and with
pianist Jesus Maria Sanroma.

At the delightful at-home given at
Government House by the Lieutenant-
Governor, Sir Edmund Herring, and
Dame Mary Herring the State drawing-
room was bright with spring-blossoms
and daffodils. The hostess chose a frock
of mist-blue tie-silk patterned with a
white sprig-design, the skirt softly flared,
the bodice having a deep collar draped
to one side into a half-bow. Pine-green
pure-silk-taffeta was chosen by her
daughter Margaret for her frock, which
featured a full knife-pleated skirt and
short cuffed sleeves. The Premier’s wife,
Mrs. Bolte, wore golden-brown velvet.
Among young guests were Elizabeth and
Margaret Millear, from Willaura;
Deborah Tapp, of Camperdown; Joan
Nixon, of Ballan, and her fiance, Richard
Andrew ; Malcolm Cockburn (Adelaide);
Dr. Helen Murrell (also of Adelaide);

wool frock a small cap of tulle flowers
in two shades of blue. Also in the re-

Women’s Group of the Australian-

speak at their meeting in the Bamboo
Room of Chevron Hotel would have
none of it. They found her talk on
her experiences stimulating. The guest-
of-honor was welcomed by Lady Casey,
and vice-presidents Mrs. Charles Lane
and Mrs. Mark Clements. Also in the
official party was Mrs. Walter Killough.
Among those who enjoyed June’s talk

The banquet-hall of Menzies Hotel
was the setting for a parade of Aus-
tralian wool-fashions to be shown at
Lausanne Fair in Switzerland early
in September. Featured were coats, suits
and frocks in colors which, however,
were disappointingly drab. But the hand-
knitted garments were superb. One shirt-
frock of cream hand-knitted wool in an
all-over lace-design had pearl-buttons
trimming the bodice and cuffs on the
three-quarter-length sleeves, and there
was a swa t be G f olive-green silk at the
waist. Hand-knitted ski-sweaters, sports-
clothes and sweaters for day -wear were
attractive, and worthy of mention was
a spring - coat in brilliant - red wool
fastened with large pearl - buttons and
finished with a low-slung buttoned belt,

One little snippet of “old silver” lore
is that if, say, a spoon has the Queen’s-
head mark on it, that spoon cannot be
earlier than 1837. It is definitely not
Queen Anne, for the Monarch’s-head
duty-mark was not instituted until after
Queen Anne died, and there was no
reigning Queen of England from then
till Victoria came to the throne in 1837.
Yvonne Minton, who at 21 is one of
Australia’s most promising young con-

David" by the Sydney Symphony

holder of the Elsa Stralia scholarship
for three years and was runner-up in
the vocal section of the. A.B.C.’s 1960
Concerto and Vocal Competition. She
will go overseas next April to continue
her study of singing in London and hopes
to make a career in concert and oratorio
work. Her fellow-artist at the Promenade

These Prom, concerts are quite an
acquisition to Sydney life. It was really
exhilarating to find oneself among the
crowds in the National Art Gallery on
a sunny Sunday afternoon, families and
couples and earnest individuals. Many
had come to see the current exhibition
of aboriginal-art (definitely not the
Namatjira type, by the way), some to
wander through the courts viewing the
paintings, some (about 300) to listen to
the music, and a few to view the viewers.
This last is almost as rewarding as view-
ing the arts, in so many varied and
vital ways does the population of Sydney
present itself. The next Prom, concert
will be on Sunday, October 23, free,
of course. Meanwhile the National Art
Gallery offers an exhibition of art-
objects and a promenade of its own well
worth the watching.

an especially lovely crescent of bush-

for a gala-dinner on Saturday in aid
of the Royal N.S.W. Institution for Deaf

guests were and the party
flowed-out from the unusual hexagonal-
shaped living-room to the garden, where
huge braziers and trees twined with
fairy-lights illuminated the lawns over-
looking Middle Harbor. Mrs. Bill White,
president of the social-committee,
assisted Mrs. Dusseldorp in welcoming
the guests, and during the evening a
parade of fashions was given by Purple

Miss Doris Chadwick is a lady-in-the-

most of us over the past 38 years, though
perhaps we did not realise it at the time.
For she has been editor of the “School
Magazine” and writer of those stories
“John of the Sirius” and “John of Sydney
Cove” which have brought Australian
history to life for so many Australian
youngsters. This week Miss Chadwick
retired from the Department of Educa-

in England, do more research into Aus-

books for children.

There is some excitement and con-
troversy at present about the proposal
to build a huge modern hotel at Govett’s
Leap with a mock old-world Australian
village in the valley. Few seem to worry
themselves about the unattractiveness, on
the whole, of the road to the Blue
Mountains. The old Australian habit of
decorating the main streets with broken-
down fences, derelict huts, rusted-iron
roofs and old motor-cars is one that
can be seen any day out along the main
Western Highway. Let us clean all this
up first before we start any old-world
villages and such.

black void of the disturbed night,
the Captain stayed on the bridge.
After the fourth torpedo the star-
board list came off her and she heeled
slightly to port. She always did carry
this slight list to port. Then, with
the way still on her, her bows dipped
gently to the surface, then further.
Her four propellers came clear of
the sea. Three of the shafts were now
broken, but the fourth was still turn-
ing. She went down for all the world
as if she was steaming over the
horizon.^
“She did not sink,” they said, “she
steamed out.”
In the Captain’s day-cabin, as the
ship sank in the water, the sea had
poured in and risen. It covered the
Captain’s desk. Then it crept higher,
swirling in the darkness there. It
reached the level of the mantelpiece
and sent a ripple along it. Five
model-ships floated off: Stuart lead-
ing, followed by Voyager, Vampire,
Vendetta and Waterhen. A faint
echo came above the splash of the
sea— l like the ships. And five little
ships sailed out into the darkness of
the cabin in search of their Captain,
lying dead on the bridge.
A few survivors eventually reached
an island off the western coast of Java
and there re-rigged a derelict ship’s
lifeboat. Hungry, thirsty, their skins
coated with oil-fuel, they put themselves
at the mercy of storm and calm in the
open sea, driven by their love of the
ship and exalted by the spirit of her
end. Their aim was to sail all that
remained of her —this boat they named
Anzac—to Tjilatjap, on the south coast
of Java, the port Perth was making
for when she met her last action.
When they finally arrived at Tjilatjap
they found the port in the hands of the
Japs and were themselves taken
prisoners. It is a tale of courage hardly
ever surpassed in the annals of the sea,
and one of the few great books so far
written about War 11.
Naval Architecture
One book’s villain can’ easily be
another book’s hero, but it was some-
thing of a shock to see John Scott
Russell, the man who is charged with
delaying and with Machieyellian dupli-
city mucking-up the Great Eastern in
Rolt’s life of Brunei, beatified in The
Institution of Naval Architects, 1860-
1960, by K. C. Barnaby (Allen and
Unwin): —-
The main credit for the foundation
of the Institution of Naval Architects
must go to John Scott Russell, who
called a preliminary meeting in the
autumn of 1859.
Nevertheless, he is shown even in
this book to be a somewhat shifty
character, since whenever the matter of
testing resistance of hulls to water
comes up he maintains that the per-
formance of models in tanks bears no
relation to the performance of full-size
hulls, demands that tests be conducted
on full-size hulls and despises all
theories of hull-performance which are
not based on his theory, that a hull is
resisted by the energy required to dis-
place and replace the water through
which it moves. But when William
Froude showed that displacement had
nothing to do with it, but only surface-
friction, and evolved a method of
blowing-up accurately the results of
model-research into performance for
larger hulls—who had known it all
along, and talked about his own
interesting early experiments with
models, but John Scott Russell?
The Institution was formed so that
naval architects could pool their experi-
ence and bring theory to bear on
British shipbuilding anybody’s
theories, since French, Italian, Japanese
and German experts were welcome to
read papers to it, and later on the In-
stitution held an annual meeting or so
in Germany and France ; but in his
inaugural address in 1860 the first
president. Lord Hampton, referred to
Brunei’s Great Eastern as a “noble
specimen of naval architecture.” It was
the rise of steam, and the feeling that
France, especially, was outstripping
Britain in the construction of men-of-
war, which brought the British experts
together.
They had a great deal to learn.

large-paper pages, which h a "1

With the use of iron, there cume tte
problem of corrosion and fouling' i
ill-effects on iron plates of copper
sheathing; the solution of this profe,
by sheathing the plates in wood, and
then in copper; the early use of steel,
when they found that punching rivet,
holes in the steel made the plates®
brittle that they cracked worse tha
iron.
Another of the early problems of I
British designers was the emergence of
the American monitors, iron-plated sea-
fortresses. In the Institution’s argu-
ments this became a battle betwea
turret-guns and broadside-guns. Cf>
tain Coles was so intransigent a ®
paigner for the turret-gun and the low-
freeboard ship that he was allowedio
have his own way; and when his 3®
4000-ton turret-ship, Captain, will
freeboard of only 6ft. instead of It
Admiralty’s stipulated Bft., went do®
in the Bay of Biscay with all but lid
her crew, one can feel a certain amount
of smug “I-told-you-so” in the com-
ments at the Institution’s next m
meeting. The case of turret-ships was
lost for the time being, alttaj
Coles had been right, and his tip
guns were the forefathers of W
mountains on swivels that #
out their multiple cannon fore and® |
of modern battleships (at one ® i
when they were muzzle-loaded,J I
muzzles had to dip through the d %
to be loaded). The only v
result of Captain Coles’s expend h
was “the famous curve for the J |
tain,” which showed “that an incl jJP.

THE BIG WEB
I’ve a good nose for perfumes but no head
For the names of flowers, therefore when
I walked
In the garden, pausing to sniff at the
flowers, l said
To myself no more than “Nice.” I
sometimes talked
At the big fat spider with the small round
head
And his (or her) innumerable offspring
(or assistants)
Who tinily skittered about while their
daily bread
Was packaged and stacked for them by
the big boss (or mistress) ;
Meaning all those insects who flew or
crawled to the aforesaid
Garden, no doubt like myself merely to
say “Nice,”
Only being more concerned with the
taste of the air and the fountainhead
Of the flowers’ sweet selves (their
perfume, that is) than twice
As careful as usual, wound up in the web,
mere bread
For those of and by whom “Nice” has
never been said.

there was something a little more of
real-life about Mr. Critchley’s paper on
the raising of the submarine Thetis and
the discovery that she sank because of
“minute blobs of bitumistic paint,”
while in 1946 Dr. Todd’s paper on
“Mulberry Harbor,” the concrete tanks
towed across the Channel for the
Normandy invasion, and M. K. Purvis’s
paper on “Pluto,” the pipe-line under
the Channel, enabled the Institution to
be wise after the event.
Nor is the book without literary
curiosities. At the 1923 meeting Sir
J. E. Thorneycroft and Lieutenant
Bremner gave details of the coastal
motor-boat which in World War I ran
up to harbor shipping, discharged a
torpedo backwards from its stern and
turned out of the torpedo’s course be-
fore the torpedo got under forward-
way. This motorboat, with its casual
young British driver, became the
material for one of the American
William Faulkner’s most hair-raising
stories of War I derring-do—so here, in
the story of the boat’s construction and
the two plans on page 315, the Institu-
tion provides an illustration to one of
the best of American books of short-
stories.
And at the annual meeting of 1954
Viscount Runciman “expressed great
satisfaction at the formation of the
Australian branch, which had been due
to the initiative of Mr. Cecil Boden.”
Beautifully put out, the book has
very few plates of photographs, be-
cause, says the author, most of the
Institution’s collection of photographs
are of wrecks. There are appendices of
the Royal Charter, presidents, trea-
surers and secretaries; a year-by-year
list of papers read; pictures of its suc-
cessive offices; an index of ships
mentioned and an index of names.

The Break: Jose Giovanni (Cape).
An ex-convict’s story of attempted
escape from La Sante prison in Paris.
The book gives a fine description of
prison-life, but parts of it which
describe the preparations for escape
take a little swallowing—could warders
be quite so dumb?

The Devil Flower: Emigdio Alvarez
Enriquez (Seeker and Warburg). A
simple, unpretentious, exceptionally
attractive novel by a writer from the
Phillipines, whose setting is a small
coastal town on one of the remoter
islands of his country. The story is a
sort of folk-tale, of romantic love in
the old, high, innocent tradition
twisted and spoilt by ignorance, super-
stition and circumstance. Ercelia, the
heroine, is a beautiful, intelligent
village girl who goes to Manila for a
convent training as a teacher and
returns to work in her own town, where
her adolescent attraction to an older
man precipitates disaster. It is a
medieval conte in modern exotic setting
—a story that could repeat itself
wherever essentially medieval societies
meet a world that has for better or
worse outstripped them.

Kino: Jay Ley da (Allen and Unwin).
A richly detailed and uncommonly
well-written history of the Russian film
industry, with special and intelligent
regard to its social, political and artistic
performance. Excellent chapters on the
lively but little-known industry that
existed before the revolution; brilliant
summary of the experimental ’twenties;
some first translations of valuable
critical and theoretical writing; descrip-
tions of some films that have never been
shown outside Russia (the author spent
three years in Soviet studios and film-
schools); records of early reactions to
the medium of Tolstoy, Gorki and
Mayakovsky; some photos.
