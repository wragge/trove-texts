JUEW PLACE MUSEUM, in Chapel
Street, was originally the home of
Thomas Nash, who married Shakespeare’s
grand-daughter, Elizabeth Hall. TJiis
beautiful sixteenth - century timbered
building was restored in 1912, and is now
a museum containing local history,
Shakespearian and archaeological relics.
Behind the museum may be seen an
Elizabethan Knott garden and the Great
Garden of New Place. The original New
Place, built by Hugh Clopton in 1483,
was the largest house in Stratford and
was bought by Shakespeare in 1597, and
to which he retired in 1611. In 1756 it
came into the possession of Rev. Francis
Gastrell, who, enraged by a wrong tax
assessment of his property by the town
council and by the too frequent incur-
sions of visitors, first cut down the cele-
brated mulberry tree said to have been
planted by Shakespeare, and then, in a
further fit of rage, burnt the house to the
ground in 1759. This needless destruc-
tion of a venerated building so infuriated
the inhabitants of Stratford that they
chased the Rev. Gastrell from the town.
Only the foundations of the original
house remain today.
The delightful New Place gardens con-
tain a shoot from the original mulberry
tree planted by Shakespeare and a replica
of an Elizabethan garden which has all
the flowers mentioned in the poet’s works.
The Guild Chapel, which is used by
boys from the Grammar School for a
daily service during term, was founded
in 1269. From the chapel the curfew
bell is rung daily. Over the Chancel arch
is a fine mural painting of “The Day of
Judgement,” dating from about 1500.
The ancient market-town of Stratford-
upon-Avon, which is visited annually by
over two hundred thousand visitors from
all parts of the world, is a town full of
character, unspoiled by the ravages of
time and war, where tradition and historic
buildings perpetuate the best in the life
and culture of the English-sneaking
peoule.

WORD-SAVAGERY .
The penalty for having a master in any
art is a decadence; that is, a concourse
of lesser men, gathered together by his
genius, but unable to exploit to the full
the instrument, he has developed.
The best of these men, realising their
limitations, will attempt to develop one
phase of the master’s art, or will go to
work on some phase of the art which the
master has left alone.
Thus Cyril Tourneur followed Shak-
speare, whom he had studied, as many
of his blank verses show. Moreover,
he had one of Shakspeare’s gifts ; accord-
ing to Swinburne: “the fiery jet of his
molten verse, the rush of its radiant and
rhythmic lava, seems as inexhaustible
as that of Shakspeare’s.” But for the
dramatic model of his Revenger’s
Tragedy, Tourneur went to Marston and
“the long-established revenge-play tradi-
tion.”
The result was a play which gained at
least an equal intensity with Shakspeare’s
intensity by throwing over Shakspeare’s
breadth of treatment. From the many-
sided tragedy of Shakspeare, Tourneur
isolated the lust and violence, and from
Shakspeare’s immense choir Tourneur
took only the voice of Caliban:
You gave me language, and my profit on’t
Is, I know how to curse.
The Revenger’s Tragedy is keyed to its
opening lines, iq, which Vindici, “lineal
descendant of Hamlet,” clasping his dead
love’s skull in the dark of the stage, de-
scribes the play’s main characters as they
walk across:
Duke, royal lecher; go, gray-haired adultery,
And thou his son, as impious steeped as he:
And thou his bastard true-begot in evil:
And thou his Duchess that will do with
devil,
Four ex’lent characters —
Except for the two well-meaning
murderers, Vindici and his brother Hip-
polito, their sister Castiza, and old Lord
Antonio, whose young wife has been
raped by the Duke’s youngest son, the
main actors are all such “ex’lent
characters.”
The Duke has poisoned Vindici’s girl-
friend because she would not yield to
him ; and for this Vindici lures him into
a dark conservatory and into kissing the
dead girl’s skull, made into the face of a
life-size doll, the lips poisoned, so that the
Duke falls down and dies.
Before this, the Duke’s oldest son,
Lussurioso, has been seeking Vindici’s
help in the seduction of Vindici’s sister,
and with the eager approval of her
mother.' Vindici dissuades him from an
early beginning by offering Lussurioso
the opportunity of finding his mother, the
Duchess, in bed with the Duke’s illegi-
timate son, Spurio.
By chance the Duchess happens to
have been spending the night with the
Duke, who, seeing his oldest son in his
bedroom with drawn sword, suspects
treason, and sends Lussurioso off to
prison. Lussurioso’s two younger
brothers, anxious to get him out of the
way, persuade the Duke to have Lus-
surioso executed ; but by a clever mistake
Lussurioso is freed and the youngest son,
imprisoned for rape, is executed. Vindici
and Hippolito then kill Lussurioso and
the other brothers at a banquet.
Then the two brother-revengers make
the mistake of telling old Lord Antonio
how they managed these murders, think-
ing he will be pleased, but he hies them
off to execution, and there an end.
This ending, in which the brothers en-
compass their own ruin in a moment of
triumph, has been much admired for its
naturalness, just as, in our time, there
have been words of praise for the ending
°L- u Postman Always Rings Twice, in
which the hero is convicted for an acci-
dental death after he has got away with
murder; or the ending of No Pockets in
Q -.uu-’ wh . ere the hero is shot dead
with his nose in a dustbin, after spending
so much time cleaning-up the town with
a muckraking weekly paper; or the end-
lngi Shoot Horses, Don’t They
and Of Mice and Men, where the lover
and the friend respectively shoot the
heroine and the best pal respectively be-
cause of despair and mercy respectively ;
or the ending of The Maltese Falcon,
where the detective in love with the
murderess gives her up to the police be-
cause it is either his life or hers.
But the modern tough-guy novel has
more than an epigrammatic ending in
common with the dark plays of the Shak-
spearean decadence.
The tough-guy novel is a decadence
from the art of Hemingway, an art of
severe and self-imposed limitations as
compared with Shakspeare’s, but an art
of sanity and balance, of such normalcy,
in fact, as to be almost an effort to
standardise a normal man. From police-
court reporting Hemingway’s writing
takes its stenographic dialogue, and from
moving pictures its concentration on what
was said and what was done, to the rigid
exclusion of any character thinks.
At once the most pure, the most solid
and the most swift of writing techniques,
it lends itself to being read again and
again.
Its main strength is action, and Hem-
ingway has sought action for his stories
all over the world, in wars, in bullrings,
on safari, at prize-fights and in the under-
world. ft would be surprising if there
were not more lust and violence in such
stories than in stories about suburban
clerks and housewives. But the difference
between Hemingway and the writers who
follow him is that Hemingway puts lust
and violence down as he finds them,
whereas they put them down as they
invent them; and that Hemingway puts
lust and violence down as part of life,
while they isolate lust and violence as the
subject-matter of their stories.
Isolation is a very practical part of the
technique of the tough-guy novel. The
people in The Postman Always Rings
Twice are fatherless, motherless, sisterless
and motherless Adams and Eves making
love and murdering in a lonely road-
house ; in Love Me, Sailor, a girl of no
morals is isolated on a shipful of seamen ;
in No Pockets in a Shroud a young man,
so free from family connections that he
seems to have been sculpted by Phidias
rather than bom of an earthly mother,
varies newspaper exposures of abor-
tionists, sporting ramps and the Ku-Klux-
Klan with attention to the needs of some
six women (one a nymphomaniac, an-
other a paying client, the mother of one
of his younger seducees); in They Shoot
Horses, Don’t They, the hero and heroine
are two lost souls lost in a dance-marathon
whose appeal is that they are too weary
to make love; and in Of Mice and Men
the tough-guy novel secures its greatest
triumph, the union of lust and violence
in the person of Lennie, the sexual-
perversion murderer, and its triumph of
isolation —the isolation of insanity.
The men and women of Tourneur and
Marston, says Vernon Lee, “are scarcely
men and women at all; they are mere
vague spectres, showing their grisly
wounds and moaning out their miserable
fate. There is around them a thick and
clammy moral darkness . . .”
Or compare the speeches. Around
1600, says Professor AUardice Nicoll in
his superb Fanfrolico Press edition of
Tourneur, “satire was becoming pqpular
m the hands of Marston and Hall, and
with the satirical tendency came’ the
movement towards a new language, the
language of self-conscious youth, eager to
show itself clever at all costs.”
That was in 1600. Next, in Ellery
Queen’s “Mystery Magazine,” Australian
Edition, Number 12, 1948, is this
foreword:
We think you will be interested in Lester
Dent s comment on his story. “It is an
example, he wrote to your Editor, “of the
word-savagery ‘Black Mask Magazine’
brought out of its writers.”
“Word-savagery” —that’s a brilliantly
accurate description of the technique fos-
tered by “Black Mask,” and which has
fanally come to be recognised as the hall-
mark of the authentically American genre.
Yes, savagery savagery in style, sophistica-
tion, sex and sleuthing
For instance, from Mr. Lester Dent’s
story:
Fain gave Sail’s mouth the shape a
rubber-band takes when it lies loose on a
desk. He perspired. He got down on the
floor on top of the kid.
The plump boy worked on nothing but
the arm. He hissed, “How you wise
beyond me!” and sounded like a
small bulldog with a bone.
Sail finally got two forefingers of his
free hand in the boy’s nose. He pulled,
got the kid’s head back. The kid’s mouth
strained wide open and he sounded as if
he were gargling water. Then he came
loose. Sail hit him, then got away from
him. The boy lay on the black battleship
linoleum and trembled.
Tourneur is not to be outdone in
toughness, or in word-savagery. Take
the scene from The Revenger’s Tragedy
where Vindici and his brother fear the
poisoned Duke may call out and bring
assistance. Vindici says:
Nay faith, we’ll have you hushed now. With
thy dagger
Nail down his tongue, and mine shall keep
possession
About his heart, and if he gasp he dies,
We dread not death tp quittance injuries:—
Brother,
If he but wink, not brooking the foul
object,
Let our two other hands tear up his lids.
And make his eyes like Comets shine
through blood
It is true that the best of the tough-
guy novelists have got a long way ahead
of the “Black Mask Magazine” stories,
especially in what the “Mystery Maga-
zine” editor calls “sex-savagery,” and
here the best comparison Tourneur has to
offer—no doubt it thrilled its Elizabethan
audience to the marrow—is the scene
between the Duke’s illegitimate son and
his Duchess, which begins with the
appropriate stage-direction:
Enter the Bastard meeting the Duchess.
Spurio: Had not that kiss a taste of sin
’twere sweet.
Duchess : Why there’s no plfeasure sweet
but it is sinful.
Spurio : True, such a bitter sweetness
fate hath given;
Best side to us, is the worst
- side to heaven.
Duchess : Push, come: ’tis the old Duke
thy doubtful father,
The thought of him rubs heaven
in thy way,
But I protest by yorier waxen
fire,
Forget him, or I’ll poison him.
Spurio; Madam, you urge a thought
which ne’er had life.
So deadly do I loathe him for
, my birth
That if he took me hasped
within his bed
I would add murder to adultery,
And with my sword give up his
years to death.
Duchess: Why now thou’rt sociable, let’s
in and feast.
This is mere child’s-play to the in-
genious and varied “sex-savagery” of the
tough-guy novels; indeed, a most in-
teresting monograph could be made from
an enumeration and analysis of love-
scenes in tough-guy novels, beginning
with the girl biting through the man’s
lip in The Postman Always Rings Twice
—but it is not my purpose to repay many
happy hours spent in this dangerous com-
pany by compiling material for Crown
Prosecutors whose word-savagery has
often been more deplorable than that of
our authors.
Nor do I wish to harp on the simi-
larity of the tough-guy story and the
tough - guy detective - story with the
revenge-play tradition, nor, by calling
them decadent, do I wish to imply more
than that these stories are a decline from
a more complete art.
But what I should like to deny is that
tough-guy novels are “realism.” Exactly
what is realism in literature is hard
to say, but I do know that it concerns
not only technique, but also intention.
And the intention of the tough-guy novel
is not to portray people but to exploit
a technique. The technique of the tough-
guy novel is to put a man without friends,
wife, father, mother, sister, brother,
children, club, church, politics or any
other of the ties which embed so many
of us chickens so firmly in our suburban
aspic, into a situation in which he can
display his utmost capacity for lust and
violence.
If the tough-guy appears as a detective,
then he has social sanction for the lust
and violence, and he generally survives,
and, reduced to the serialised absurdity
of Peter Cheyney’s Mr. Callaghan, adds
yet another contented glamor-girl client
to his harem of satisfied customers. If
he goes in for lust and violence in a
purely private capacity, the tough-guy
generally gets wittily killed-off.
On the other hand, no one will deny
that the best of the tough-guy novels are
works of art; they “pass the shows of
the world before the desires of the
mind”; they have design, form and
finish —but so has a fairy-tale. Perhaps
that is the best description of them;
they have the same appeal for adults as
have, for children, the head-choppings,
the giant-killings, the cunning peasants’
stratagems, and the Princess-salvagings of
those industrious old word-savages the
Brothers Grimm.
RONALD MCCUAIG.
Lyrics of Midnight.
A writer whose first book •is every-
where greeted with astonishment and de-
light, as was Judith Wright’s The Moving
Image, is not altogether to be envied.
Her second book. Woman to Man (Angus
and. Robertson), will everywhere be ex-
pected to live up to the first. It will have
to be the same thing over again; it will
have to be entirely different; it will have
to be better.
To satisfy these somewhat contradic-
tory requirements, when reviewers in any
case quickly lose their capacity for
astonishment and come to take excel-
lence, even perfection, for granted, may
be difficult. But one thing is certain about
Woman to Man: if it were Judith
Wright’s first book it would make quite as
much of a sensation in the world of Aus-
tralian poetry as did The Moving Image.
In the first place, there is the same
unique vision; the indefinable thing
which pronounces the writer a poet as
distinct from a composer of verses. And
with that, translating the vision into art,
there is the same mastery of technique.
With an underlying richness of color
and music and emotion that lifts it into
poetry, Judith Wright’s is essentially an
honest, a workmanlike, style, the poetic
equivalent of the “plain English” in
which Hazlitt said the best prose was
written. All the technical devices by
which poets achieve their musical effects
are known to it, from the contemporary
rediscovery of such assonances as
“damage” and “savage” to relieve the
monotony of rhyme to the onoma-
topoeia of
summer’s bubble-sound of sweet creek-water;
but chiefly it is a style intent upon its
business: which is to isolate and clarify
the poetic image.
Running straight ahead, with a natural
rhythm and in a natural choice and
order of words, it is employed with such
skill and such fidelity that time and again,
as in “The Mirror at the Fun Fair” or
“The Twins,” it can only be described as
perfect. Nothing is said too much or too
ornately; nothing is left unsaid ; every-
thing is said with grace, with melody,
with absolute clarity and in the intensity
of vision. This is “The Twins”;
Not because of their beauty—though they
are slender
as saplings of white cedar, and long as
lilies—
not because of their delicate dancing step
or their brown hair sideways blown like
the manes of fillies—
it is not for their beauty that the crowd in
the street
wavers like dry leaves around them on the
wind.
It is the chord, the intricate unison
of one and one strikes home to the
watcher’s mind.
How sweet is the double gesture, the
mirror-answer;
same hand woven in same, like arm in arm.
Salt blood like tears freshens the crowd’s
dry veins,
and moving in its web of time and harm
the unloved heart asks, “Where is my reply,
my kin, my answer? I am driven and
alone.”
Their serene eyes seek nothing. They walk
by.
They move into the future and are gone.
And again, if The Moving Image did
not exist, the direction of this intensity
of vision and excellence of technique to-
wards the Australian landscape and the
Australian tradition would be sufficient
to make Woman to Man a striking and
outstanding contribution to our litera-
ture. Whether it is the bull like Jupiter
among his cows —
In the olive-darkness of the sally-trees
silently moved the air from night to day.
The summer-grass was thick with honey-
daisies
where he, a curled god, a red Jupiter,
heavy with power among his women lay—
or the old sisters who review their lives
in the shade of the veranda where the
sun beats on the yellow leaves of the
vines—
Thinking of their lives apart and the men
they married,
Thinking of the marriage-bed and the birth
of the first child,
they look down smiling. “My life was wide
and wild,
and who can know my heart? There in
that golden jungle
I walk alone,” say the old sisters on the
veranda—
or the delicate and elusive melody of
“WoAga Vine,” a poem which, like Hugh
McCrae’s “Columbine,” seems written in
pure music—
Look down; be still.
The sunburst day’s on fire,
O twilight bell,
flower of the wonga vine—
or the metho-drinker twisting in his sleep
in the terrible house of Nothing, or the
snake which, when killed, slips as an
image of terror back into the dark of the
mind from which it had emerged, or the
old convict prison where in the roofless
cells
the wind like an angry bee
hunts for the black honey
in the pits of the hollow sea—
or the camphor-laurel digging its roots
into the soil and flowering in the
(Continued on inside back cover.)

"LABOR" STRIPPED TO
THE BONE.
In determined polling, marked by an
eagerness which in many places clogged
the booths early in the day, the electors
on December 10 gave Mr. Chifley and
his queer collection of commissars and
demagogues their answer on socialisa-
tion and concomitant issues. There was
no mistaking the meaning of the vote.
It threw “Labor” decisively out of office
after eight fantastic years of bulldozer
legislation, sectional government and
wanton spending and adopted the
Liberal-Oountry-party programme.
The voters’ mandate was for the
restoration of free private enterprise, for
the abatement of totalitarian controls,
for the return to a policy of sober
finance, for the raising of production to
counter increasing living costs, for co-
operation within the British Common-
wealth. The electors plumped for a
rational system of compulsory military
training for defence, an issue which was
used basely, particularly by the Prime
Minister and Dr. Evatt, to try to frighten
women voters and appeal to the elements
of selfishness in the community.
Mr. Menzies has a mandate to sup-
press Communism, to outlaw Communist
bodies, to deal with their organisa-
tions and to ban from industrial
and public positions the ruffian
leaders who have dominated the trade-
union movement for several years
in the interests of a hostile foreign Power
and who have repeatedly held the country
to ransom for their own treacherous pur-
poses.
The programme which Mr. Menzies
has elected to carry out is not an easy
one. It will be resisted in various
quarters with every weapon, legal and
illegal, which is to hand, both by the
Communist-led unions and by “official
Labor,” where it is the servant of those
unions. It will have to be implemented
in the face of a resistant Senate majority
and with a Governor-General in office
as the third section of the Parliament
who is by tradition hostile to everything
the new Government stands for.
It is well that Mr. Menzies should have
been so clear and detailed in setting out
the programme for which he asked
approval and that the result of the elec-
tion should be so decisively expressed.
Nobody in the face of the voting can
pretend to deny his mandate and
authority. And there can be no doubt,
either, now that all the temporary sup-
port in bewildered “middle-class” country
and suburban electorates has been with-
drawn, what sort of a party the “Labor”
party is and whence it draws the core of
its support and policy.
It has been stripped to the bone
by a defeat which can leave it with little
more than a third of the House
of Representatives, and which would
have smashed it had it been a
shade greater. It held 43 seats to the
Opposition’s 29 in the old House, in
which there were two Independents. In
the new House it will be lucky (on figures
available on December 12) if it has more
than 50 out of 121.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Dr. Evatt,
comfortably elected by a margin of
11,000 in 1946, was brought by a woman
candidate within measurable distance of
defeat. Mr. Dedman, a serious candidate
for leadership of the party when Mr.
Chifley retires, looked, on December 12,
as if he had lost Corio. Mr. Scully—
“Minister for the Gag”— appeared then
to be facing defeat; Messrs. Lemmon
and Barnard were in the same
box. Messrs. Burke (Perth), a white-
headed boy of Mr. Chifley, Fuller, the
Government Whip, in Hume, Langtry in
Riverina, McLeod in Wannon in Victoria,
Sheehy in Kingston (S.A.) all appeared
to be defeated, though not so decisively
as Hadley and Conelan in Queensland.
It is obvious that “Labor” has retained
its bones only through the support of that
part of the industrial world in which the
Communist bosses rule. Its place is in
the haunts of J. Healy, Idris Williams,
E. V. Elliott, Ernie Thornton, J. J.
Brown and Donald Thompson. Only in
their realms did “Labor” poll majorities
which made it safe. Only where the
Communist party, the “workers’ van-
guard,” polled its poor best in process of
showing the red flag and “giving leader-
ship to the masses for the united front
with Labor” did “Labor” support reach a
level which allowed the party candidates
to breathe freely throughout the counting
of votes —the one exception was Mel-
bourne Ports, where no Communist candi-
date was nominated in a conspicuously
strong Communist centre against Mr.
Chifley’s Minister for Labor and Industry,
Mr. E. J. Holloway, who said during the
last Parliament that he “could show that
every aim of the Communist party was
based on the teachings of Christ.”
The list of “safe” seats for Labor, as
shown by the polling, makes interesting
reading;
N. S. Wales: Blaxland, Cook, Cunning-
ham, Dailey, Darling, East Sydney,
Grayndler, Hunter, Macquarie, Newcastle,
Reid, Shortland, Watson, Werriwa, West
Sydney.
tt Victoria: Batman, Burke, Darebin,
Hoddle, Maribyrnong, Melbourne, Mel-
bourne Ports, Wills, Yarra.
Queensland: Herbert, Kennedy.
* Au str dlU*: Adelaide, Hindmarsh, Port
Adelaide.
W. Australia: Fremantle, Kalgoorlie.
Every one of these 31 seats is industri-
ally under the domination of the big Com-
munist unions—miners, wharflaborers,
seamen, metal-trade workers, transport
and/or building workers. And the polling
shows that the more powerful the Com-
munist control of an electorate is, the
greater is the “Labor” majority.
By no stretch of imagination can
“Labor” claim to be invincible in any
other than seats where the Corns are
also strong, and if there are any doubts in
the party Dr. Evatt, Messrs. Dedman,
Lemmon, Leslie Haylen, Mulcahy,
Conelan, Hadley, Fuller, Langtry and
others will no doubt have the power to
exorcise them. It is a fact material to
the nature of the new Parliament, how-
ever, that though in the House of
Representatives the members from these
Communist-nm industrial districts form
the vast majority of the Opposition, and
can dominate it at present strength, they
can never again dominate Parliament.
It is also material that the “Labor”
party in the Lower House represents a
restriction of area which is startling and
unhealthy. It actually represents not
Australia but the more-congested and
unruly sections of three crowded capitals
and one or two industrial cities and ports,
a fact which is calculated to produce deep
and serious thinking as to whether the
present system of deciding electoral
quotas is equitable to the vast areas out-
side the capitals and large district centres
of the type of Newcastle and Townsville.
Reviewing the election and all that
went before it, there seems to be little
doubt that during the last Parliament,
and only then, did the Australian people
become fully aware of the reality of
“Labor’s” socialisation objective and its
entanglement with Communist union-
leaders, That the people reacted so
vigorously even at this late stage is some-
thing for which posterity should be
sincerely thankful.
Mr. Menzies is to choose his Cabinet
next week. His programme will not be
announced until the new Ministry has
had time to discuss its programme. It will
be sound policy to proceed carefully and
with due preparation. The enlargement
of the Parliament will make the next
session the beginning of a new era. It is
inevitable that the increase in the number
of members, no less than the advent of
so much new blood that on the Govern-
ment side it will form the greatest section
of the party, should have its effect on
the conduct of Parliament and the nature
of its proceedings and procedure.
The old atmosphere of committee-like
intipiacy will disappear. The latitudes
which have been unique in Canberra will
cease to operate. The importance of
good “whipping” and of Parliamentary
organisation will perforce thrust itself
upon the attention of both Houses in a
very short time.
The rules governing the rights of
members to speak will need to be drasti-
cally revised if the use of the gag is not
to become oppressive. And the time cer-
tainly has come when standards of con-
duct in Parliament must be considered
and dealt with by reform of the Stand-
ing Orders and the imposition of discipline
from the Chair which will make im-
possible in future the wanton rowdy-
ism, bad manners and standover methods
which have grown up during the past
year or so to the disgrace and degradation
of the “Labor” Government and the
Speakership.
Probably the first essential in the new
House is a strong and impartial Speaker,
backed to the hilt by the Government,
and determined that Parliament shall set
an example which will strengthen its right
to enforce decorum and obedience to the
law throughout the country.
Soon, under the leadership of Mr.
Menzies and Mr. Fadden, Australians
hope to see the beginning of a new
political and social era, with the Govern-
ment of the country representative of its
traditions and its people and not of
sectional interests and hazy political
adventurers and doctrinaires. This grand
country for eight critical years has been
in danger of being politically murdered,
Standards of Public Life.
Most people who heard the sentiments
expressed by New Zealand party leaders
on the result of the late elections, the
words of Mr. Peter Fraser on his defeat
and those of Mr. Holland on the prospect
of succeeding to the leadership of the
national Government, forgot the acerbities
of the election fight in admiring the
temper of the two men as they accepted
the result. Their few words did a lot
towards reassuring electors that there are
decencies in public life which go far to
redeem politics from the all-too-common
public contempt. But they are in them-
selves not enough.
Something has to be done in Aus-
tralia to restore the standards of conduct
in public affairs from the unhappy level
to which they have degenerated, especially
during the latter years under “Labor” in
office. Nobody expects combats in the
political arena to be waged without dust
and heat. When the electorate at large
is thrown into acute dissension by “the
class war,” as it has been under the revo-
lutiohary switch in “Labor” policy, Par-
liament is bound to reflect the passions it
engenders. When, over and above that,
“Labor” deliberately sets out to replace
Parliamentary government by caucus
rule, to aggrandise the power of the execu-
tive, and indeed to transfer the constitu-
tional authority of Parliament to a trade-
union congress to which, instead of to
Parliament, executive heads of the Gov-
ernment machinery would be responsible,
the standards of public life and the
prestige of Parliament are alike doomed
and eventually the democratic system of
government along with them. Both here
and in Britain the “class war” has been
destroying traditions of public life which
had somehow provided compensation for
the disrepute into which politics fall
easily enough.
The broadcasting of debates at Can-
berra has at least revealed to a wide range
of listeners the growth of bad manners
in Parliament and the intolerance of
criticism by Ministers who, from too long
a lease of power, had grown to be petty
despots. Part of the trouble is that the
Speaker under “Labor” is obviously a
party man. His belief that he must enter
at times into the thick of some fray, and
himself speak as a partisan from the
floor, proceeds from his need to justify
himself to his constituency as a party
supporter. Indeed, as a member of
“Labor’s” caucus his whole attitude to-
wards Parliamentary debate must in-
evitably be colored by his adherence to
the party’s practice of holding its own
real debate in secret caucus meeting and
treating the open debate subsequently in
Parliament as something merely perfunc-
tory. From that to bias in his exercise
of his functions as regulator of debate is
but a short step. It was one of the worst
reflections upon the late Parliament that
on at least four occasions one member
or another moved a motion of censure on
the Speaker. These motions—like those
of no-confidence in the Government,
which had come to be almost the only
available means of the Opposition to insist
upon debate of grievances—were treated
as merely obstructionist and insincere
from the Government benches.
The enlarged Parliament, opening a
new chapter in the Federal legislature,
should offer an opportunity to correct
these abuses and revive Parliament’s
prestige. The late House could not even
agree to revise the Standing Orders. Con-
sidering the extent to which it had de-
generated, its leaving the task to the new
House was probably all to the good.
But the debasement of public life has
gone beyond the lamentable exhibitions
of Parliamentary manners and the de-
gradation of Parliamentary debate. The
standards of Ministerial conduct in office,
the cynical abuse of power in order to
still criticism and refuse investigation,
especially in cases of alleged malfeasance
by Ministers, have fallen as never be-
fore. The late Government went to every
possible length to repel Opposition efforts
to get a public inquiry into the “Keane
trunks case,” involving the reputation of
a Minister for Customs whose death
abroad prevented his meeting the charges
in person. The New Guinea timber
scandals would have obliged any former
Prime Minister to suspend immediately
the Minister concerned pending inquiry.
When finally a royal commission was not
to be avoided, the vital questions of how
the convicted “liaison-officer” Garden
came to hold the position he did, why he
had the run of the office of the Minister
(not the Minister to whom he was by
appointment then responsible), and why
the Minister (as he said) did not know
what was going on for some 18 months,
were never answered. Nor did the Gov-
ernment desire them to be answered.
How individual Ministers behaved, with
whatever different voices they spoke to
the public on important matters of de-
bate, mattered less to the leader of the
late Government than the business of
holding his team and his caucus together.
Anything which might “split the party”
must be suppressed—at any cost. What
other principles Mr. Chifley held, so far
as the public was made aware of them,
did not appear. He became more and
more the autocrat of the late Parliament,
and his ignoring of that responsibility to
the electorate which was the very basis of
his high position finally brought about his
downfall.
There could be no worse contempt of
the standards of public life than that of
Mr. Chifley in his Bank Grab legislation.
He had no mandate for it, he refused to
seek a mandate by referendum, and even
in face of nation-wide protests at the out-
rage he went ahead as though he did not
care whether he had a mandate or not.
Virtually the whole of the late Parliament
was occupied—and defiled —by this
effort, in the legislature and in the courts t
at defiance of the popular will. From the
electorate’s point of view the Govern-
ment in effect outlawed Parliament. Yet
when it came to the elections the Gov-
ernment not only sought to shout down
this issue, long overdue fot decision by
the popular vote, but even affected, quite
impenitently, not to be bound in future
by its own platform objective to pursue
the same course.
The standards of public life are aban-
doned indeed when the leader of a great
party, the alternate party in the govern-
ment of the country, refuses to stand up
honestly before the electors to the pro-
gramme to which he is pledged under
penalty of expulsion from his party for
any backsliding. The closing days of the
election campaign were electrified with
the disclosures made by Mr. Lang, a
militant rebel from the militant “Labor”
party, and Mr. Chifley’s bitter adversary
on personal grounds—disclosures con-
cerning loans at high interest rates during
the depression years by Mr. Chifley (in
association, he contended in an abusive
reply, with others) to small “Labor” men
and others in his home district. The
weakness found by this shaft was Mr.
Chifley’s ardent campaigning against the
trading banks, his parade of the “iron
entering into his soul” because of the
banks’ assistance of the depression, as
he alleged, by their deflationary policy
and high interest charges.
This revelation by another “Labor”
mortgagee, his rival in politics, and
Mr. Chifley’s reply to Mr. Lang
—“He is a Labor rat. lam not pur-
suing any further a Labor rat into the
sewer”—put the finishing touch to the
late Government’s contribution to the
decline of standards of principles in
public life.
This decline must be checked and
remedied whatever it costs the Chifley
Government’s successors in patience and
self-restraint. *
PLAIN ENGLISH
Menzies.
The election was pre-eminently Mr.
Menzies’s victory, and it has happened
at a point in his career where his most
useful span of years is still in front of
him.
During the late Parliament, when the
Opposition’s rights and privileges were in-
creasingly ignored under Socialist conduct
of the House, few men saw the threat to
the freedom of this democracy more
clearly. Personal abuse left him undis-
turbed ; he was aware that even in regions
of the electorate where his party must
gather its support he was personally at
some discount. Some of those electors
who feared the late Government’s trend
the most, and whose faintheartedness in
face of the prospects seemed a recurring
affliction of weakness, had doubted
Menzies’s leadership; and it was on this
lingering doubt that the Socialists
greatly depended. Mr. Menzies showed
no sign of distress over it He knew
the job to be done and took command
as though he was the only man who could
save this country from the decline he
apprehended; and as soon as he opened
the campaign he inspired the community.
There was no mistaking the response.
The earlier jeers from dissenters about
“Pig-iron Bob” he received with gusto as
disclosing his—and, as he said, Aus-
tralia’s —enemies, the Communists. The
cry did not long survive under the en-
thusiasm aroused among the crowds that
attended his meetings. When, just as the


campaign was warming up, his voice sud-
denly went, a noticeable wave of dismay
ran through the country. His overcom-
ing this temporary setback clearly de-
monstrated the sense he had that this was
the fight of his life and must be carried
through. His tour thereafter was a
triumphal progress. Mr. Menzies has his
reward now, and no man ever more richly
deserved the congratulations pouring in
upon the Liberal leader.
The management of his close alliance
with* the Country party was by no means
the least difficult part of the task he set
himself, especially with the dissension be-
tween the two factions in the Parliament
of his own State. But Menzies succeeded
in this no less than in the vanquishing of
the Socialists, and it was a fitting detail
in his victory that the Liberal party,
which his spirit had nurtured and
strengthened against all the scoffing of
“Labor,” should have won for itself alone
a handsome margin of superiority over
“Labor” in the seats of the new House
of Representatives.
The new leader of the nation takes his
place henceforth among the greatest of
those who have guided the destinies of
this country. There has been no more
persuasive an orator since Deakin, and as
a debater in Parliament or on the platform
Menzies is unexcelled by any figure of
the past. He has forced on political sup-
porters and adversaries alike a # deep re-
spect for his qualities. Even if he had lost
this election Menzies’s campaign would
have been a magnificent effort. That
he should have won with it a victory as
resounding as any in Australian history
was entirely fitting.
Beyond doubt Australia has stood in
these past weeks at a critical juncture
in its destiny. Unquestionably it found
the man who could rise to the emergency,
and brilliantly he rose to it.
The New Parliament.
“Labor” went to the polls with a majority
which most Governments might envy. It
held 43 seats in a House of 74 effective
members —excluding the Northern Terri-
tory representative, who has no vote ex-
cept on matters affecting his constituency.
There were, in addition, two “inde-
pendent” “Labor” members, Mr. J. T.
Lang, amounting to a whole Opposition in
himself, and Mrs. Blackburn, widow of
another Independent who was author of
the “Blackburn resolution,” which the
Government held up like a banner during
the campaign as its charter of modera-
tion.
The new enlarged Parliament is one
which “Labor” constructed. Whether the
Socialists acted in this as a result of the
public outcry against banking nationalisa-
tion and feared defeat at the polls will not
be known for a long time. But one of
the most calculated and unscrupulous
acts of “Labor’s” career was the
reorganisation of the Senate voting
arrangements so that even a major
defeat would leave “Labor” in
control of that House. It remains to be
seen whether the Senate, in which it can
expect to have 37 out of 60 members, will
bow to the country’s mandate. If it does
not the Government will need another
mandate, and on the vote in the indi-
vidual electorates it should have no diffi-
culty in getting one, since the polling has
been heavily against the Government in
all States.
In a Representatives increased in size
by 48 seats, “Labor” seems to have made
a net gain of only three or so, while the
Opposition gain will be over 40 on the
figures available on Monday.
An outstanding feature of the election
has been the number of new members.
On figures not complete on December 12
these seemed to be about;
Libcral-C.P. A.L.P.
Old. New, Old. New.
N. S. Wales .. 7 17 14 9

W. Australia 14 3
Tasmania ...2 2 1
26 49 28 18
Subject, of course; to later election re-
turns ; and they exclude the two non-
voting Territories representatives.
The standard of ability among the new
men is higher than for years. They in-
clude several members seasoned in
Federal politics—of whom the most
prominent is R. G. Casey, along with
K. C. Wilson, former Senator (S.A.) —
many who have made their mark in State
politics, including W. M. Kent-Hughes,
a man with a distinguished war record
who was a prisoner of the Japanese in
Malaya and recently Deputy Premier of
Victoria, and D. H. Drummond, who,
replacing J. P. Abbott for New England,
with E. J. Eggins (Lyne), will carry the
New-State banner to Canberra. One
V.C., Colonel Anderson, a hero of the
operations north of Singapore in 1942,
will be added to a distinguished roll of
Government - party returned soldiers.
South Australia contributes a former
Lord Mayor of Adelaide in J, McLeay,
whose brother George will almost cer-
tainly be returned to the Senate.
Generally speaking, the new Houses
will be much more powerful from a
debating viewpoint than the old. The
House of Representatives is the best for
two decades, and it will certainly not be
the weaker for the access of debaters
like W. C. Wentworth and Paul Hasluck
—who accused Dr, Evatt of “changing
his plumage in mid-flight.” Properly
managed and organised, stable govern-
ment and a bearing worthy of a national
Parliament can be expected of it. It is
a Parliament in which the Ward-Calwell
larrikin element should feel very lonely.
The Job Ahead.
Mr. Menzies, with the co-operation of
Mr. Fadden and his other Liberal and
Country-party colleagues, has a vast job
of cleaning-up to do. The repeal or
amendment of dozens of “loaded”
Socialist Acts of Parliament, allowing for
“Labor” obstruction in both Houses, will,
in itself, take up time. And then there
are the major problems of dealing with
Communism in the trade-unions, restor-
ing the nation’s full productivity (firstly
•on the coalfields), stabilising the value of
our Australian pound, and, inevitably, the
dollar and devaluation problems. Also,
the maintenance of present world
prices for our exports is by no
means assured. If export prices
be taken in relation to internal production
costs, there is little doubt that the Chifley
Government sat in the box-seat during
the flushest and lushest of the post-war
years. Chifley sowed the inflationary!
boom ; Menzies may reap a world prices'
slump eventually. j
But, allowing for the job of cleaning
up the mess after eight years of Socialism,!
the outlook is not one merely of political'
drudgery. The heading of the Australian
economic vehicle simply in a different
direction will make productivity easier,*
especially if producers are quite clear in*
their minds as to where they sit on the l
wagon and where they are heading.
The facts that Socialism has been beaten, !
that budgeting will aim at assisting free
enterprise as well as giving the people a
maximum of social security, and that in-
dustry will have its rewards and thrift its
privileges, by themselves should refresh
the country as nothing has done for the
past 10 years.
Under Mr. Menzies Australians should
be able, individually and as a nation, to
work out their own destinies to an extent
not possible over the past decade. Aus-
tralia now has the opportunity of becom-
ing industrially vigorous. But of at least
equal importance with the economic
revival will be a return of political
decency and honesty to the seat of
national Government. The practitioners
of the Marxist class-war, now to sit in
Opposition, dragged the government of
the Commonwealth down to the lowest
standard on record during their eight
years of office. They bought votes reck-
lessly, intimidated the judiciary and en-'
couraged the larrikin.
The abiding aim of the Menzies Gov-
ernment should be to restore our standard
of living and our standard of public
decency.
In the Wake of Whittington.

anniversary of the founding of their party.

There have been gaps, terrible ones
caused by the Black Death and the
Plagues; and, even in recent times, the
deprivations of war and the devastation
of fires have caused a break in the tradi-
tion.
Meanwhile, between the yearly pomp
and proud banqueting, merchants have
traded successfully for profit, bringing
prosperity to their country. Neither idle-
ness nor privilege made the city a
clearing-house for the world. But now it
seems that the city fits uncomfortably
within the Socialists’ planned State.
That hoary champion of the faithful,
Mr. Emanuel Shinwell, who was himself a
guest of the Lord Mayor at the
November banquet, has risen to defend
the Prime Minister, whose flat reception
may well have defined the breach that
has long been widening between the Gov-
ernment and the City. Let those who will
enjoy their formal banquets, said the
Minister for War, speaking to a Labor
audience, but just give him the good old
fish and chips, wrapped up in a nice clean
paper like the “Daily Herald.”

POLITICAL POINTS
After eight years of “Labor” govern-
ment the electors showed on Saturday
that they had had more than enough;
Australians clearly do not want this coun-
try to - become a Socialist State. Chifley,
Evatt and Co., apart from standing “on
their record,” presented the choice to be
made as one between “full employment”
and an alleged Liberal plot to discipline
the workers by means of a deliberately-
engineered “unemployment pool.” It is
extremely unlikely that they believed in
the “plot” ; it is certain that they hoped
to get the swinging voters to believe it
sufficiently to take their minds off
“Labor’s” determined efforts to introduce
Socialism by fair means or foul. The
Opposition insisted that Socialism was the
real issue, despite the frantic endeavors
of “Labor” to soft-pedal it. Before the
counting was far advanced on Saturday
night it became obvious that the electors
had rejected the “unemployment-pool”
story; either that or they were pre-
pared to take a chance on it under a
free society rather than accept the regi-
mentation of Socialism.
Saturday’s election again demonstrated
an Australian political rule; When
“Labor” boys go wild with strange
doctrines the swinging voters won’t stand
a bar of ’em. Lang knows it, and Scullin
knew it. Chifley depended on “short
memories.”
In the old House of Representatives
the party cut-up was; “Labor” (includ-
ing Lang and Mrs. Blackburn), 45;
Liberal, 17; Country party, 12. On
Friday the “putative” House arrived at
by distributing the 1946 figures among
the 121 new electorates was divided:
“Labor,” 70 ; Liberal and Country party,
51. The Opposition had therefore to
win 10 seats of “Labor’s” assumed holding
to defeat the Government. When this
page went to the printer it looked as
though the Menzies-Fadden partnership
had not only done this but had reversed
the numbers of the “putative” House,
with every chance of further gains unless
“Labor” men trailing behind in doubtful
seats received unexpected windfalls.
Early on Saturday evening Liberal leads
in the'New South Wales seats of Lowe
and North Sydney showed that the swing
was on, but as the counting progressed
and “Labor” fell behind in Mitchell and
Robertson, which required something like
a five-per-cent, swing on 1946 figures
to change hands, it began to look as if
a landslide was possible. The steady
lead which Graham (Lib.) maintained
over Nicholson (Lab.) in the Sydney
metropolitan seat St. George, where
“Labor” had had a paper majority of
over 10,000, further encouraged this
belief. Early Victorian figures also
showed Opposition gains, but it was in
Queensland that the extent of “Labor’s”
losses really deserved the term “land-
slide.” Pre-polling forecasts gave the
Liberal and Country parties a good chance
of winning 11 or 12 of Queensland’s
18 seats. At midnight on Saturday they
were assured of 14. A similar trend
away from “Labor” was shown in S.A.,
W-A. and Tasmania,
Figures from Dar Win only were avail-
able from the Northern Territory, where
the Federal A.L.P. Executive, had ordered
a special onslaught on the returned
p.-0.-w. A. M. Blain —Blain 1364, Nelson
(A.L.P.) 1783 and Webster 686. Blain
appeared on these figures certain to win
on Webster’s preferences—to win far
better than the well-to-do “Labor” pub-
lican Mulcahy.
The big vote recorded by Mulcahy’s
Liberal opponent Willis in the Lang
electorate—on Monday Mulcahy was
only 1700 ahead in a poll of 37,000, and
looked like depending on the Communist
preferences for a win—was mostly due
to the general swing and good cam-
paigning, but the “Labor” representative
must have lost quite a lot of support
through memories of his cowardly attack
on Blain, which was one of the most
disgraceful blots on the record of the
none-too-clean Eighteenth Parliament.
J. T. Lang had hinted early in the cam-
paign that he had something up his
sleeve; he produced it four days before
polling-day—a list of mortgages regis-
tered in the names of J. B. Chifley and
Mrs. Chifley. The loans, aggregating
£15,000, covered a period from 1930 to
1942, and bore interest at rates ranging
from per cent, to 9 per cent. Lang
challenged the Prime Minister to refute
his charges. Chifley replied the follow-
ing night at a meeting in Lang’s elec-
torate. He said that (1) the mortgages
referred to were trust money invested
by him on behalf of others, (2) he had not
made “one penny of personal profit out
of any transaction,” (3) the only money
he had personally loaned was £BOO which
he put in because the lender did not have
enough money to meet the borrower’s
needs, and (4) that New South Wales law
required a trustee “firstly, not to disclose
the trust, and secondly to receive
what is the standard or ruling rates of
interest.” He accepted full responsibility
for the financial transactions of Mrs.
Chifley,
Chifley’s reply did not really refute
Lang’s main charge—that while attack-
ing the banks for lending money at high
rates of interest he-had been doing the
same thing himself. That the money in-
volved was trust money does not make
the transactions any less inconsistent with
Chifley’s oft-repeated attacks on banks
and other financial institutions. The
Liberal and Country parties kept out of
the dogfight,
Intended as a winning hit, it seems
likely that Lang’s disclosures really acted
as a k.o. for J.T. himself. The electors of
Blaxland three years ago gave Lang
12.000 votes and Morgan (A.L.P.) a
similar number, Lang winning on the
Liberal man’s preferences. On Saturday
Jack could manage only 8500 against the
18.000 of Harrison, a by no means
impressive candidate. The Liberal,
Handran-Smith, is at present a few votes
ahead of Lang, but the question of pref-
erences is not likely to arise. At 73, Lang
is Right—OUT.
Bryson (Lab.), defeated by Mrs. Black-
bum in 1946 in her husband’s old seat,
Bourke (Vic.), has taken back the top end
of it, now know as Wills. During the
campaign an interjector asked him, “For
which ‘Labor’ party do we vote?”
Bryson replied that the electors should
regard the position “as one in which there
is only one ‘Labor’ candidate for the elec-
torate, and that candidate is Bryson.”
Odd, that, coming from a member of the
party which had resurrected Maurice
Blackburn’s 1921 “resolution” in a plain-
tive attempt to make its socialisation ob-
jective seem harmless. When counting
finished on Saturday Bryson was 10,000
ahead of Mrs. Blackburn. At the same
stage in 1946 he was as far ahead, yet lost
the seat on preferences. There is no such
likelihood this year, as Mrs. B. is trailing
the Liberal candidate and will be the one
excluded.
Falstein, too, found out how hard it is
to beat the machine. On the new
boundaries he had an estimated majority
of nearly 13,000 at the 1946 election,
when he still had “Labor’s” blessing.
Lacking it this time, he’s more than that
number behind the official “Labor” pea,
Curtin, and 9000 behind Card of the
Bank Officers’ Association, who fought
the seat for the Libs.
Sunday was not a day of rest for the
vote-counters, and their labors provided
material for a restless night for four
Federal Ministers. By Monday Scully
(Gwydir), Dedman (Corio), Barnard
(Bass) and Lemmon (Forrest) had fallen
behind their opponents. The first three
electorates were straightout fights, but
in Forrest (W.A.) Lemmon had three
opponents—Freeth (Lib.), Potts (Country-
Democratic) and Bolitho (Ind.).
Dedman had led Hubert Opperman in
the early stages, but when the contest
began to develop into a six-day bike-race
it seemed likely that Oppy’s staying-
power would be too much for him.
Scully and Barnard also seem to have
oone their dash, and there will need to
be a big drift in preferences to save
Lemmon from going back to his plough.
Under redistribution most sitting
members managed to pick the safer slice
of their old electorate, leaving new candi-
dates to scramble for the crumbs. As a
result, most “Labor” members of the old
Parliament will also be in the new despite
the landslide. Exceptions are Williams
(Robertson, N.S.W.), Langtry (Riverina,
N.S.W.), Fuller (Hume, N.S.W.), Conelan
(Griffith, Q.), Hadley (Lilley, Q.) and the
four Ministers already mentioned. Mc-
Leod (Wannon, Vic.) and Burke (Perth)
are also struggling hard. No Liberal or
Country-party member was defeated.
Under sentence of political liquidation
—Premier McGirr (N.S.W.) and Govern-
ment. The casket, ordered on December
10, will probably bear a plate certifying
to the part of Comrade Clive Evatt in the
obsequies.
Cable from Wellington (N.Z.) received
by The Bulletin on Monday morning:
“Hallelujah—Old Subscriber.”
Among old Labor men who rejected
Chifley-style “Labor”-Socialism in this
election was E. J, Hogan, twice Premier
of Victoria, who, last week, spoke in sup-
port of Liberal candidates because he
“was convinced that the ‘Labor’ party
today is sliding towards Communism.”
During Hogan’s second term as Premier
—he was also Treasurer—he helped to
formulate the 1931 Premiers’ Plan and
subsequently steered it through the Vic-
torian Parliament after a stormy passage.
Next year the A.L.P. bosses tried to per-
suade him to repudiate the plan, but he
stuck to his guns and was rewarded by
expulsion. The party he led had 30
members in the Assembly ; it returned
from the ensuing election with 18, and did
not regain the Treasury benches until 11
years later —and then for five days only.
Last week Hogan declared that the
Chifley party’s “whole policy was Com-
munism, even if its supporters were not
aware of it.”
Conductor Toscanini has declined the
offer of a life Senatorship in the Italian
Parliament, one of five such appointments
the President is permitted to make from
the ranks of music, art and science. If
our own Senate were not already so
bloated in numbers there might be some-
thing to be said for adopting the idea
here. There would then be some point in
the prima donna broadcasting hour.
One of the wiliest tricks of the election
campaign was Dr. Evatt’s sudden resolu-
tion in U.N.O. —in opposition to Britain
and the United States —for the establish-
ment of international control of
Jerusalem ; in other words, for the taking
of the control of the Holy Christian
Places out of the hands of the Jews. The
only reason which observers could ascribe
for our No-longer-wandering Boy’s
sudden urgency in the pressing of this
measure was that he thought it might do
good with certain Australian religious
sections alienated by “Labor’s” socialisa-
tion policy. It certainly did no good in
Barton, and what must make the pill
doubly bitter is that even Israel is busy
cursing and defying the great Australian
opponent of “genocide” and threatening
practical defiance of U.N.O.’s decision.
According to reports from South
America the Japanese colony in Brazil
still does not believe Japan lost the war.
Some of Saturday’s vanquished ones are
experiencing a similar difficulty in con-
vincing themselves that they were really
licked.
It is doubtful whether the Radio
Control Board’s ban on political comment
from broadcasting stations during the last
three days of the election campaign would
have survived an appeal to the courts.
Radio-stations compete with newspapers
both in the advertising field and in sup-
plying a news-service; they could surely
plead that they had been singled out for
unfair treatment as against their com-
petitors.
An advertisement asks what Captain
Cook would say to airline travel between
England and Australia in four days. It
would be far more interesting to hear
what he’d say if the Endeavour berthed
at a Sydney wharf and he had to wait
while the wharfies unloaded her.
Voters in three Melbourne Assembly
electorates go to the polls again on
Saturday to elect successors to three
Assemblymen elevated to Canberra. Two
of the seats were held by “Labor” —
Clifton Hill, from which J. L. Cremeau
switched to the new Federal seat, Hoddle,
and Richmond, which S. M. Keon gave
up to succeed Scullin in Yarra. The
other seat, Kew, was held by W. S. Kent-
Hughes, who, on Saturday, won Chisholm
for the Libs. No change is expected in
the party representation of any of the
three Assembly seats.
The Chifley mortgage bombshell has
given McGirr something to chew over.
An attack of the same sort made three
days before a N. S. Wales election would
find the person at whom it was aimed
powerless to reply, thanks to the McGirr
newspaper ban.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Joseph Chifley, 64, out, and
Robert Gordon Menzies, 54, and Arthur
A. Fadden, 54, in.
Now striding out solidly on his 80th
lap, poet Arnold Wall, one-time Professor
of English at Canterbury University
(M.L.). Landing from England in 1899,
he began an association with the college
which lasted till 1932. Deeply interested
in botany, he studied Maoriland’s flora,
sometimes with Leonard Cockayne, and
collected and mounted some 5000 speci-
mens for Canterbury Museum. An
alpinist as well, the poet prof, does not
deem the time ripe to cease from scaling
misty mountains and scratching up there
for seeds. As late as last year he made a
stiff climb 6000 ft. up Avalanche Peak in
pursuit of his hobby. As well as his
poetry, botanical, scientific, humorous
and educational works stand a monument
to his knowledge and industry.
“Macnell”; James Maxwell Ramsay,
lately Pilot (the navigating, not the winged
variety) of carrier Sydney, now Director
of Training and Staff Requirements at
Navy Office, is* distinguished in two
things, apart from a solidly competent
career. After finishing his navigation
course in England early in 1941, he was
appointed to battleship King George V—
here he was officer of the watch when
that heavy took on Bismarck in the raw
light of early morning in Denmark Strait.
He saw Hood blown to slivers. Towards
the end of 1944 he captured Akyab, the
Burma rice port, singlehanded. Landed
from destroyer Napier with orders to
survey the harbor, Ramsay carried a
Webley in one hand and a Union Jack
in the other. He nailed the flag to a
telegraph-pole at the end of the main
pier, and thus put Akyab. back into
British hands. He beat the Army into
town by several hours. Now 33, he hails
from Hobart.
A vigorous 52, J. R. Sutcliffe, head of
Melbourne Grammar for the past T 1
years, resigns this Month to enter the
business world. Born and educated in
Maoriland, Sutcliffe took a science degree
at Wellington’s Victoria University, and
was Assistant Lecturer in Physics there
when he left for World War I. After
serving in France and Belgium with the
machine-gunners he resumed teaching at
the Wanganui Collegiate, at 33 became,
head of Scots College, Wellington, and
nine years later crossed to Melbourne.
“S.G.H.” (Hainan Island): The war is not
yet over for one lieutenant-commander, R.N.R.
—Captain (of the merchantman Sing King)
J. L. Branagan, 0.8. E., who recently brought
his ship round Good Hope Cape, shaped
course for Lu Yu Channel (entrance to
Swatow), breasted Sugarloaf Island in the
channel and ran into a fusillade of machine-gun
fire. That was all right—Branagan and crew
were used to pirates in the Canton River. But
when added m.gs. and a field-piece joined in,
and bridge windows, boats and superstructure
splintered, he decided things were a bit too
willing, and stopped main-engines to await a
pilot. Shortly sampans drew alongside loaded
with green-uniformed soldiers of the “New
China” Army, and blue-uniformed rankers of
the political army, most without socks, many
without shoes, but all armed with an astonish-
ing variety of weapons, from Lugers and Brens
to hand-grenades and Crimean pieces complete
with ramrod. With them were the pilot (armed
guard of 10) and the Port Medical Officer
(rating 12), all of whom, guards included,
pried noisily through the ship, with even the
most simple domestic appliance calling for
open-mouthed awe. Branagan tried to find an
officer to appeal to. It was useless —all were
of equal rank. He did learn that the shooting
was merely a People’s Signal requesting the
ship to stop. At 2.25 p.m., when moored to a
pontoon, came the bombers. That cleared the
ship! Sing King was strafed, her motorboat
fired, she lifted under the blast of a near-miss
and her pontoon was blown to the bottom.
All clear, and Branagan demanded return of
his papers. The People’s Customs replied that
any attempt to leave port would be resisted
by the artillery—strangely muzzled during the
air-raid. Branagan found his ship’s cargo
cleared in record time—adequate guards on the
wharfies ensured that. At last, with captain
and officers just about exhausted with machine-
gun-checked exasperation, Branagan got his
ship away at 5 o’clock next morning. The
guns ashore were silent —it was raining heavily.
Spending £lO,OOO a day would be a
headache, even in these h.-c.-l. times ; but
to C. Faragher, who from last week titles
himself Superintending Engineer of
Queensland’s P.M.G. Department, that’s
the least of his worries. His immediate
concern is paring down the State’s wait-
ing-list of over 6000 would-be telephone-
subscribers. Well-wired to all the angles,
he joined-the Melbourne p.-o. engineer-
ing branch in 1913, shifted north to
Queensland as metropolitan telephone
engineer in 1937, and in two years had
jumped to assistant to his present post.
Before that a world tour embracing
Britain, Europe and the U.S. tapped the
experience of those countries in tele-
communications research. As with other
States, lack of underground equipment,
not phones, is the main problem. But
the new Super has hopes that when a
factory in Victoria is completed next-year
all his troubles, with the equipment it
produces, will be buried underground.
Theatregoers of last century, not to
mention this one, will be gratified to hear
that 86-year-old Gaston Mervale, prob-
ably the oldest practising histrion in the
Australian theatre, got an ovation on his
last appearance —the small stage of Mel-
bourne Repertory at Middle Park, Mel-
bourne. By a coincidence the piece, in
which the veteran mummer played the
part of a calm, contemplative German
philosopher, was one of J. B. Priestley’s
“Time” plays. Mervale was closing 69
years of entertaining the Australian
public, mainly in the professional theatre.
He was a sound, dignified actor of the
old school. The occasion was also the
last appearance of the Repertory Co.,
which has relinquished its lease of the
theatre.
Better than an ambassadorial job is
the mission of A. J. L. McDonnell,
London adviser for the Feltorf Bequest,
visiting Melbourne to see in situ the
£ 150,000-worth of pictures he has bought
for the National Gallery in the past two
and a half years. The job has tajcen him
into the homes of the British aristocracy,
who just don’t have enough to live on
these days and have to sell their Old
Masters, and to every capital, and most
galleries, of Europe. London is still the
clearing-house of the art world, and
Americans, with millionaires behind them,
are the biggest buyers. Still, they don’t

always make the best buys. “The Cross-
ing of the Red Sea,” by Nicholas Poussin,
cost the Felton Bequest £14,000, which
was considered a hefty price to pay for
the work of an artist who doesn’t rank
among the really great. A few weeks
later the Metropolitan, New York, paid
£30,000 for another Poussin not supposed
to be as good as the one in Melbourne.
A. J. L. McDonnell was born in Too-
woomba (Q.) and educated in Sydney.
He is a student of art, not a painter.
The distinguished-looking gentleman
here presented is managing-director of a
large brewery —in, unfortunately for these
droughty parts, Auckland (MX.). Owner,
as well, of the Auckland “Mirror,” Henry
Joseph Kelliher rates his descent from
three generations of Maorilanders enough
of a family-tree to title himself a “fair
dinkum Enzedder.” In the Kaiser’s war
he served three and a half years with
artillery and trench-mortar units of the
N.Z.E.F. In 1936 he was appointed a
director of the Bank of New Zealand;
BEER BREWER.
his ideas on currency-control—a stable
price-level through central-bank control
of the volume of currency—have been
widely published across-Tasman. He re-
signed that directorship shortly after
Prime Minister Savage died. These days
he relaxes from running his brewery and
chain of 40-odd pubs by driving across
a specially-built causeway on to his own
500 acres of private island in Auckland’s
Manakau Harbor. Here he breeds stud
Ayrshires, Aberdeen-Angus and sheep.
“Cauboy’s” farewell:
Having seen the late Dame Irene Vanbrugh
through her two Australian visits—the first in
1923 and the last in 1927—1 am left with the
pleasantest recollections of the second, when
she had abandoned tragic and young roles and
had relapsed into middle-aged parts, in which
she spent most of an evening comfortably
ensconced in a nest of cushions, sewing. In one
play, whose name I have forgotten, she spoke
scarcely a dozen lines, yet dominated the pro-
ceedings with her charm and sweet forgivingness.
It requires immense natural talent to interest
an audience through three acts in the spectacle
of a middle-aged actress engaged in sewing.
Most of her appearances were like family
reunions, her manager-actor-producer husband
Dion Boucicault being always in attendance as
her spouse or elder brother. Like many
actresses, including her sister Violet, Irene
Vanbrugh came out of a rectory, at a time
when most religious circles regarded the stage-
door as the gateway to Hades. Her father was
Prebendary Barnes, a friend of Irving and
Ellen Terry. A wonderful woman, whose ser-
vices to repertory were greater than to the
stage commercial, she was, at the end, just
preparing to bring a new play, “Mary Bona-
venture,” from the provinces to London; which
recalls that her first London role was obtained
for her by Lewis Carroll, the professor who
wrote Alice in Wonderland and who, when
Queen Victoria asked him for another of
his delightful books, sent her a work on
mathematics.
Twenty-six years of solidly competent
engineering landed J. R. Dridan his
appointment last month as South Aus-
tralia’s Engineer-in-Chief. Now 48, he
graduated Bachelor of Engineering from
Adelaide University in 1922, had his first
job on the Murray lock scheme and later
became resident-engineer at Lock Eight,
near Lake Victoria. A large part of the
Morgan - Whyalla pipeline carries his
mark, as does Broken Hill’s improved
water-supply. With his name established,
other States called him in—the Ma State’s
present Darling River scheme has Dridan
as its source. The brilliance of his pre-
decessor —H. T. M. Angwin, whose death
caused the vacancy—has set the new man
a high-water mark to emulate. His
record indicates he’ll make it all right.
For the first time in, the Australian
history of the Rhodes Scholarships a son
has taken on the mantle of his father*
Peter Hamilton Bailey, who got his
Christmas present last week, is the son of
Professor K. H. Bailey, Commonwealth
Solicitor-General, who was the Scholar
for 1919. Bailey, senior, was educated
at Wesley College and the University of
Melbourne, qualified in jurisprudence,
served with the artillery in World War I,
went to Oxford and later became eminent
in the League of Nations councils and the
United Nations Preparatory Commission.
Bailey, junior, was schooled at St.
Anthony’s, Wallingford (Eng.), and at
Wesley, Melbourne; passed his first year
of the law course, and was appointed to
the Attorney-General’s Department and
the Treasury. He returned to full-time
study in 1948, rowed with the University
crew and played football for Queen’s.
He won’t specialise in law like his dad,
but intends to widen the scope to philo-
sophy, politics and economics.
Mrs. Betty Rickards and Field
Grosvenor Rickards made history in Mel-
bourne by being the first married couple
to be'admitted to the legal profession on
the same day, having graduated together"
at the University. The motion of ad-
mission of the female partner was made
by J. W. S, Vroland, solicitor, of Euroa,
who retired from the Bar owing to
blindness 15 years ago.
Melbourne’s one-time famous Whistling
Policeman, L. R. Boyd, who enlivened
the tedium of traffic duties by emitting
harmonious sounds without cease, has
whistled himself into a thriving business
with a turnover of £lOOO a month.
Tartan-weaving, it has brought him back
some of the prominence he lost when he
resigned from the police force because of
arthritis. Some of his Highland wear,
exhibited at the Australian Trade Com-
missioner’s office in New York, elicited
orders even from Scotsmen, while some
orders came from the East Indies. Him-
self a Fifth Battalion man of the Kaiser’s
war, Boyd got the idea after seeing fellow-
patients weaving scarves at Caulfield
Military Hospital. Now he employs a
staff of 16, his wife does most of the
cutting and his 250 patterns of Highland
tartans are traditionally exact in every
detail.
Adrian Lawlor, art critic to the A.8.C.,
awarded the Bendigo Art competitions to
two Sydney artists who have won the
prize before. Sali Herman won the £lOO
oil-painting award for “The Derelict,”
and Len Annois scored in the watercolor
section with “An Essay in Color.”
Into the Silence:
In Sydney, at 60, after a brief nine months
in the N.S.W. Assembly, Brice Mutton, Liberal
for Concord, which seat he took from Labor
in a close fight in the March by-election. Born
in Cornwall, over 40 years an Australian, he was
a master-builder, and was Mayor of Concord
for several terms.
In Auckland (M.L.), at 93, Clement Lawrence
Sutton, old-time jehu who covered most of the
Waikato area with his coaches and 200 horses.
His father was in charge of supplies during
the Maori wars. For 50 years Clement drove
the coach between Hamilton (now a city) and
Raglan, over what were roads only in name.
At 66, in Melbourne, Dr. Arnold Victor
Richardson, one of Adelaide’s brilliant scien-
tists and a director of the Waite Agricultural
Research Institute and chief executive officer
of the C.5.1.R.0. Getting his M.A. in Adelaide,
his D.Sc. in Melbourne —the latter for original
research into the water requirements of farm
crops and in wheat-breeding —he became
Superintendent of Agriculture in Victoria, and
held the post for 13 years. Altogether he
attended five scientific conferences overseas.
In Cairns, at 61, Goronwy Owens, chairman
of the Cairns Ambulance Committee since 1933
and one of the originators of the aerial
ambulance service. Bom in Manchester, and
landed in Australia after World War I service,
his mercy work brought him his recent brother-
ship of the ambulance Order of St. John.
In Christchurch (M.L.), at 69, Rev. T. M.
Curnow, who was as well a successful versifier,
contributing two verses weekly for 25 years to
the Dunedin “Star.” Preserved in a collection
titled Bad King Wencelas and Other Verse, one
of them finds a place in the Golden Treasury
of New Zealand Verse.
At 58, in Sydney, Robert Russell-Scott, a
Scot who came here for The Firm in 1928 to
play in “The Student Prince” and liked what
he saw so much that, after a brief period of
film-work in Los Angeles, he returned to settle.
A producer with the A.B.C. till 1943, he was
in commercial radio at the end.


Society
"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Youanmi”: My wife and I have been
observing the building of a small and
charming cottage near our selection, and
to our admiration has been added con-
siderable speculation about the owners.
From the size of the place we estimated
that it was someone of moderate means,
probably a young couple like ourselves.
As the bricks were set on the foundations
and the design became apparent we knew
it must be for someone of good taste;
when the windows, doors, etc., were
recognisable their scope and position were
sure proof of intelligence and common-
sense ; when the roof went on —dark-
green, steep and skirted—it indicated
more than good taste and intelligence—
someone with feeling and artistry in their
bones. So there it was: the new owners
could only be a young couple, dreamy,
artistic, yet practical; an architect or an
artist; possibly even a young doctor and
his wife—only someone of superior in-
telligence and appreciation for living
could have planned and built such a
perfect little place and set it so perfectly
in its surroundings. This morning the
new owners put their name over the front
door in blue letters a foot high—“ The
M.M.C. Electricity Department, 1949.”
* * * *
“Jasby”: As part of a programme de-
signed to banish “religious sentimen-
tality” from the schools in the Soviet
zone of Germany, Christmas this year is
to be treated as “a popular festival of
Spring.” I suppose, to the commissars,
all things are possible, and perhaps under
the Stalin regime it is just as easy to
change the seasons as change the calen-
dar, but I have an old-fashioned idea that
in Europe Christmas Day falls three or
four days after Midwinter Day and one
day before St. Stephen’s Day, of which
one of the few carols still permitted to
be sung in the Russian zone records “the
snow lay all around, deep and crisp and
even.” Still, the Russians are nothing if
not thorough, and they’ll probably
arrange to have the snow all swept away
to reveal the first blades of a new Soviet
variety of early-spring grass pushing
their way up through the soil. Just how
they’ll get rid of the robins and bring the
swallows back I haven’t worked out yet.

“Col M.”: Having caught a canary I
went to a big emporium to buy him a
house and to pick up a few pointers on
care and maintenance. I struck oil with
a young chap sprinkling shellgrit among
some lovebirds. “I would first impress
on you,” he said, “a most important point.
Beware of draughts. They are canary-
killers.” He went on to speak of food-
stuffs, and as he mentioned each item he
placed a packet on the counter. He told
me to supplement with certain greenery,
bringing to mind the tea advertisements
when he emphasised “just the top tender
leaves of the dandelion.” Cake was
allowed, but sponge with jam filling would
gum up the bjrd’s beak. A slice of apple
now and then was admirable. “Another
point,” he said. “Canaries love to bathe,
enjoying it best first thing in the morning
with their cage yp in the sunshine. It is
one of the really beautiful things to watch.
Of course, during his escape, your bird
may have lost the daily habit, so leave his
bath in the cage not more than ten
minutes; if he doesn’t use it, take it out.
No beg-pafdons.” He went" on, lost in
his subject, oblivious to the other fuming
customers, but finally he wrapped my
package and handed me my change. I
was nearly at the door when he called
after me “I forgot. Sand. Clean sand
in the bottom of the cage. Essential.”

“Mullum”; A bank-teller I know has
solved the problem of keeping cool on
hot days. Protected by a high counter,
he rolls his trousers above his knees,
takes off his shoes and socks, and stands
in a basin of water. „

“Wusslean”; The plight of the office-
worker who. bought an expensive model-
construction outfit but wasn’t game to

of his extravagance (B. 23/11/ ’49) has
a parallel in the predicament of tfc3 book-

collector whose passion for books has un-
loosed his purse-strings. I once lunched
with three friends, all book-fiends with
limited resources, and learned that each
had the same reluctance to walking
boldly into the house with a parcel of
newly acquired books. They had
developed various methods of smuggling
in volumes. One used to conceal his
purchases in the garden, to be picked
up later when putting out the
milk-can. Another recommended deep
pockets in overcoats; the third said
Do look pleasant, Grandpa. We mustn't disappoint the kiddies
he used to conceal new books in
his attache-case, covered up with
newspapers. None of the three claimed
his method was_ completely wife-
proof ; collectors’ wives, it seems, develop
an extraordinarily keen faculty for
detecting expensive purchases.

“KH.H.”: Like an ageing mother who
keeps her children’s infant garments be-
cause of their sentimental attachment, so
does South Australia hold on to her old
transport vehicles. The coal strike
brought into emergency service in
Adelaide one of the open-top omnibuses
reminiscent of the age of bustles and veils.
Still to be seen on the streets at peak
periods are tramcars numbered one and
two, one-bogey bouncers linked together,
which look dowdy maiden aunts beside
the flighty Glenelg-type trams which
sometimes hit 60 m.p.h. At Victor
Harbor are vehicles of even more ancient
vintage—two horse-trams, one of which
began its service at Moonta, the other at
Gawler —which carry trippers over the
causeway to Granite Island, At Goolwa

“Coongan”: I know that the uninten-
tional witticisms of our children are
dreadful to other ears, but I am still
pondering over the psychological signi-

“Derwent”: The teak steering-wheel of
Joseph Conrad’s old ship Otago has found
final resting-place in the sloop Wellington,
which is moored off the Victoria Embank-
ment in London as the headquarters of
the Honorable Company of Master
Mariners Otago was Conrad’s command
from 1887 to 1889, and he commemorated
her in his book The Shadow Line.
When she was sent to the wrecker’s
yard in Hobart, a friend of Conrad’s,
Christopher Morley, sent a deputy from
America to secure the historic wheel.
Morley took it to Liverpool, and pre-
sented it to Sir David Bone, another old
friend of Conrad, who accepted it on
behalf of the Master Mariners. Otago
had a blackwood mast, and the purchaser
of the hulk made a good deal from
Conrad admirers by disposing of the stick
in small sections for curio-making.

“Bo”: Next Wednesday Uncle Joe will
reach the biblical allotted span, and no
doubt in celebration of the event he will
include, among his usual prayers, special
expressions of thanks to the respective
inventors of the bullet-proof glass and
the purge. From his large fifth-column
in France is coming a wide variety of
gifts, totalling 3000, and it is confidently
expected by all those who have had
dealings with him and who have savored
that old-world courtesy so inevitably
associated with the Kremlin that Joe will
acknowledge the gifts by a scowl slightly
less heavy than usual. The tokens of
affection seem to the Western mind, how-
ever, to contain figurative dynamite,
Among them are thick woollen bedsocks,
silk stockings, perfume, electric-irons, 17
dolls and a racing bike with dropped
handlebars. It is therefore with complete
assurance that I predict that a purge
among the French donors may be ex-
pected at any time following Joe’s waking
up to the significance of some of the
gifts: that the bedsocks imply that he’s
badly in need of comfort for the cold
feet he’s developed over Marshal Tito and
the Berlin air-lift; that the silks and the
perfumes imply, as his squeaky soprano
speaking voice leads one to infer, that he’s
actually a bit of a pansy; that mention
of such an unknown luxury as an electric-
iron may give rise to some nasty thoughts
among the world’s happiest workers; that
the dolls would insinuate that Joe’s reach-
ing his second childhood; and that the
racing bike is a subtle attempt at assas-
sination, the donor apparently being
aware of the depth of die potholes in
Moscow’s thoroughfares.

“Oliver Filter”: I think it was Shaw
who once wrote, after seeing a perform-
ance of Shakspeare, that it would be a
simple matter to settle the Shakspeare-
Bacon controversy once and for all —just
disinter both bodies, he said, and see
which one had turned over. I suspect
the Bard may have done a few more
revolutions in the last few weeks if the
words of sundry Sydney critics about
“Much Ado About Nothing” have been
brought to his attention. One of them
weighed-in with learned reference to
“Shakspeare’s Rabelaisian humor,”
another mentioned his “Dickensian
characters,” while Anthony Quayle, male
lead of the Stratford-on-Avon Players,
was quoted as saying that the play was
very like a Noel Coward comedy. I
don’t know why any of them should
assume that Rabelais, Dickens or Coward
is better known to the public than Shak-
speare, but I imagine that Dickens and
Coward at least would be flattered to
have their works likened to those of
Shakspeare, and I’m sure that both would
agree that “Much Ado” is remarkably
like the work of William Shakspeare.

“Plop”: A one-acter recently per-
formed at a Sydney fruit-barrow after a
car had screeched to a stop in the centre
of the intersection:
First Fruito: “Did he get him?”
Second F. (looking up): “Just missed.”
Third F.: “Only bumped him in the
rump.”
First F.: “Pity. Better luck next time.”

“Chevroford”: An example of the
bubbling enthusiasm and bewildering
speed of Socialist construction (B.
7/12/’49) is a section of the Melbourne-
Heidelberg electric train-line which was
scheduled for consideration just after the
war finished. It was supposed to be go-
ing hand-in-hand with a new railway
which was to be rushed through to a vast
new suburb of Housing Commission cot-
tages which was being built on reclaimed
land near Northcote. The other day the
train was standing at Darebin and a
woman in the carriage remarked to her
neighbor what a lovely new station it
was —so much better than those old
wooden contraptions. I glanced out at
the opposite platform, and for a moment
thought that the Railways Department
had gone all horticultural. There was a
crop of weeds and grass on the new
ramp which would have provided
meadow-hay for a herd of Jerseys.
A CHRISTMAS DIRGE.
“A radio-announcer having told United States
listeners that ‘John L. Lewis has shot Santa Claus,’
the air the. following night was full of reassurances
to anxious children from Santa Claus himself that
Mr. Lewis had ‘just missed him.’ ”
O mourn no more for Santa Claus;
What Mr. Dedman couldn’t do is
Impossible to John L. Lewis:
Santa’s alive as ever was.
This morning, sweating and inert,
I saw him in the street, what’s more,
Trudging about from store to store
To buy himself a silken shirt—
The Christmas present which this year
He’ll give his wife to give to him
(She’s bought a slip with art.-lace trim
To give to him to give to her).
Moreover, boys, I followed Santa
Home to his small suburban door
Where Mrs. Claus gave him what-for
(I quote you that mature Infanta):
“Well! Fancy trusting you with money!
Why did you send home all that plonk?
You’re only happy rolling drunk!
Don’t stand there grinning—it’s not funny!’
“All right,” said Santa; “send some back.”
She said, “Well, it may come in handy;
In fact, I’ve tried the cherry brandy . . .
D’you like this train I got for Jack?”
He wound it up and broke the spring:
“These modern toys!” he said. “They’re
shocking;
However, put it in his stocking
And let him think he cracked the thing.”
Her comment on this plan was salty:
“Really! You’re morally deranged;
I’ll take it back and have it changed;
I’ll tell them —true enough—it’s faulty” ~ .
So dry those eyes, you worried mob
Of boys and girls, and have no fear:
The Clauses, full of Christmas cheer,
As usual are bn the job.

“Hamfat”: In my experience,
going back as far as most, Nance
O’Neill was the most satisfying
Lady Macbeth Australia has
seen. Humanly speaking, the
dominating and ambition-
spurred virago may well have
been a small waspish woman,
but Nance’s statuesque ample-
ness seemed to lend point to
her portrayal. Whenever I
think of Lady Macbeth my mind
pictures the O’Neill lady in the
part. Actor-director McKee
Rankin was a good Macbeth,
too; but my happiest recollec-
tion of him was of an incident
that arose from his zeal for
realism. To assist the supers
to behave naturally, Rankin had
real food provided for the
banquet scene. One night a
super failed to hear the cue
which should have brought the
appropriate silence for the entry
of Banquo’s ghost. The rest of
the diners having become sud-
denly silent, his “Pass the
pickles” was the most-clearly-
heard line of the whole show.

“Also Ran”: Frequently I read or hear
on the radio that someone was involved
in an accident, was taken to a hospital
and after treatment was “allowed to go
home.” Surely it hasn’t come to that yet?
One consults a medical practitioner for
advice on how to treat an ailment, and is
still free to take the advice or not. There
is the proviso that if the patient’s condi-
tion is such as to 1 endanger others—for
instance, if he is a carrier of an infectious
disease—the State is entitled to restrict his
movements to protect the rest of the
public, but proneness to accidents, even
if proved, surely does not come within
this category. And, if that is the state of
things now, what will it be when medicine
is nationalised?

“Eremophila”: The mail-bag had an
oddly attractive smell about it when the
man of the house dumped it on the
kitchen-table. Opened, though, the scent
became too strong. Further investigation
showed a large package containing the
wreck of two bottles of eau-de-Cologne.
The bag, the letters, the accounts —all were
redolent of the idle life of suburbia, and
seemed to have little in common with the
harsh, dusty landscape outside our
windows. The all-pervading scent —how
we loathed it after the first day!—must
have taken some explaining when letters
that rubbed shoulders with the package
reached their destinations.
* * * ♦
“Communications”: Late in ’43, on
my way home from New Guinea, I was
sent to Coen, on the Cape York Penin-
sula, to examine the radio gear and, if
possible, get it on the air—the place had
been abandoned as an ops. base, but
there was still a considerable amount of
petrol in dumps there, with a skeleton
staff to look after it. A week’s work Qpt
Coen on the air after a lapse of some
nine months. With three short schedules
a day I led a life of leisure, and almost
forgot about going home. One "day, at
the cigarette stage of lunch, we heard
the sound of aircraft. Faces lit up at
the prospect of mail and fresh food.
However, the note of the engines sounded
a bit familiar to me, so I suggested that
any aspirants for a gong could stay put,
while those of no ambition could join me
in a smart sprint for the surrounding bush.
Sure enough the Nips had arrived —two
four-engined flying-boats, one of which
remained at 8000 ft. while the other
came down and stooged back and forth,
“This is boring , Nero. Let's have another fire”
obviously taking pictures. As soon as
they left I sent a message to Townsville,
giving details and direction of departure.
After standing by for two hours I re-
ceived the reply i “Are you certain the
aircraft were not Allied?” I replied
“Yes,” and waited another hour for;
“Have you checked with all Fighter
Sectors to ensure that there are no Allied
aircraft in your area?” There was no-
thing left to do but send messages to all
the Fighter Sectors in the area. The fol-
lowing afternoon the collective replies
came in—“No Allied aircraft ? known
your area given time and date. The
’boats never came back, and if they had
I wouldn’t have troubled them —my
temper would not have stood it.

“Exdig”: An old battalion cobber of
mine who recently passed on should not
have long to wait at the Pearly Gate if
Heaven uses the nominal roll system and
has him recorded by his Army name.
An old soldier, he did not allow the
Scottish burr in his speech and the fact
that everybody called him “Mac” to deter
him from enlisting as “Aaron,” thus en-
suring that at pay, medical and similar
parades, which are tortures to the patience
of men with names like Walker or Young,
he had first call. Always first called in
our battalion, he would not have had
that honor in some units he might have
joined. I knew of one Digger who spelt
his name “Aabrahams,” but “Aa” must
surely have been No. 1 against all-comers.
Aa was a Polynesian half-caste who en-
listed in the A.I.F. while a deckhand on
a mission ship which called at Sydney.

“Zake”: I called in to see Arthur, who
lives further up the street. He had just
finished bottling his first home-brew, to
the usual hops, malt and sugar of which
he had added a handful of wheat. After
boiling and bottling he had slung the
residue over next-door’s fence, and he
was screwing through the palings as I
came in. “Thought I’d chuck the wheat
over to where it would be appreciated,
he said. “It has been—come and have a
look at them.” 1 looked ; some of the
chooks were teetering about making
futile beak-swipes at the few grains that
were left; others were scrabbling around
in dust vainly endeavoring to regain
their pins. I was aghast, for the fowls
belonged to the biggest wowser m our
suburb. “I’m doing old Gimblett a good
turn, fattening them up for him for
Christmas,” said Arthur. “By the time
they’ve got through the residues of two
more brews those chooks’ll be so well
flavored old Gimblett will have on Christ-
mas Day one of my beers by proxy.”
“Craiser”: Touching the difficulties of
the language for the New Australian. It
is just^s 8 difficult sometimes for the
native-born who knows the words ' but
who, for some psychological reason, is
impervious to the inflected meaning. A
eentleman farmer of my acquaintance
put in some vines in the hope of sup-
nlving his table with his own vintage,

“Jay Dee”: The wailing of the
regimental pipe-band had ceased; the
new guard and the old guard, inspection
finished,‘were standing rigidly to attention
on the parade-ground, and the orderly-
officer had turned to face the flag which
fluttered from the mast at the corner of
the square, Scotty, the bugler, stood to
attention and unsteadily raised the bugle
to his lips. Then the warm stillness of the
tropical Darwin evening was broken, not
by the solemn notes of “Retreat as ex-
pected but by “Come to the Cookhouse
Door,” and Scotty subsided in alcoholic
confusion.

“Me Mi Ca”: More on the sulphur
cure (B. 30/11 /’49). Mum swore by it as
a cure for diphtheria. A sore throat, and
she made a paper-funnel through which
she* blew sulphur down our throats.
Sulphur burnt in tins was also used to
fumigate a tightly shut-up house while we
kids spent the day down at the creek.
Mum’s cure for pimples or “spring spots’
was sulphur and treacle ; she would line
us up on the back landing and give us a
teaspoon each two or three times a week.
Sulphur was supposed to open the pores
of the skin, removing all impurities. It
was also used extensively in hair tonics,
and was supposed to increase a luxuri-
ance of growth.

“Becks”: For all I know everything
Shirley Temple alleged against her hus-
band, John Agar, in the course
of their divorce proceedings
may be absolutely true, but one
little item in the cabled report
of the case inclines me, at least
slightly, to sympathise with him.
His attorney’s remarks included
the phrase “ever since the troubles
between the Temples began."’
That his own attorney should
be accustomed to think of Agar
as “Mr. Temple” is an illuminat-
ing commentary on what it
means to be prince-consort to
a movie queen.

“Bagot”: I favor sensible
summer dress for men, but not

their early twenties can wear
them becomingly or with com-

middle-aged civilian in uniform,

tion of bare, bony knees rubbing
together beneath the orderly-
room table badly hindered the
paper war I waged—until I
defied Routine Orders and
donned slacks. Paraded for my

“Harold Hardupp”: Glass-cloth, in the
minds of most people merely a curiosity
of an experimenting age, is already doing
its job in industry. It is, for one thing,
rapidly displacing calico in the long
condenser-tubes of our oxide plant, the
vapor, out of which the oxide is pre-
cipitated, arising from the furnaces at a
still-fierce heat, used to char the calico
so that the tubes became useless in about
eight daysthe glass-cloth, heat-resistant,
will last for two-and-a-half years
—at least, that’s the estimate. The cloth is
woven in the usual way from glass-thread,
and is a glossy attractive material; but the
feminine idea that it might be a likeable
substitute for artificial silk in underwear
is an empty dream. The cloth wont
stand up to water, and would probably
fall into holes at the first encounter with
the laundry.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Solitude”: Seventyfiver was mending
a span of fence in behind Spectre Gorge,
and about midday I rode round to have a
bite with him. We lifted off the billy, and
as we dropped in the shade the old bloke
nodded to Blue. “Awright, time to eat,”
he informed. “Y’ better go ’n’ have yours.”
The mong trotted to a log a few yards
off and shoved his nose in the end. Ten
minutes later he was still there. “What’s
he got?” I inquired lazily. “Rabbit,”
drawled Seventyfiver, between bites.
“Every time he gets hungry he goes ’n’
has another look at him.” Late in the
Anyhow, I was tired of looking at four walls and bending over
a hot stove.”
afternoon we boiled the billy for another
snack before setting out on the long ride
to camp, and again Blue spent the inter-
lude squinting down the hollow. When
we finished Seventyfiver picked up the
axe, “Better get the thing out f’r y’, I
s’pose,” he remarked to the dog.
“Awright; well, keep back, can’t y’, till I
pull him out? Gripes, the thing’s dog-
poor,” he exclaimed, as he held the bunny
up in front of Blue. “There, see what y’ve
done?” The mong’s bulging eyes never
left the catch, and his paws marked time
eagerly. “Awright, awright, y’ c’n have
what’s left,” the old bloke assured him,
“but cripes, y’ must be ’ungry. Y’ve got
him half gorn awready, jus’ lookin’ at
him!” •
“Old-timer”: Harry hadn’t been long
on the place before we’d discovered that
he feared nothing on four legs or two,
knew euchre, crib and nap backwards,
and came up unshaken whether the night’s
drinking was done in beer, brandy or
schnapps. Of course, word got
around that we had a pretty useful
sort and inevitably all those who fancied
themselves began to talk about “having
him on.” Or if they didn’t talk about
it their mates did, which is even worse
as far as preserving the peace is con-
cerned. If Harry heard anything of this
he kept it to himself, being as silent as
he was sinewy. Then came the picnic
races at Euchapivy. Harry rode our
nomination in the Bracelet and won in
a field of five. “Gawd,” said old Tom
Bee, who’d been riding for 30 years,
“that bloke’s stone-mad. Do anythin’.
He’d ’a’ rid us all inter the ground if we
hadn’t let him through.” Only three
accepted for the Picnic Cup. I was
starter’s steward. Harry came out on our
nag, said “G’day” grimly to one rider
and held his eye for a long moment.
Then he gave a faint sneer and turned
and repeated the process on the other.
Both were still thinking it over when the
flag fell and Harry got a three-lengths
break and held it. That night, at the
ball, he monopolised the postmaster’s
daughter, who was the local belle, and
found time to wallop three rivals between
dances. Revelry was at its height when
a dusty car pulled up, a small wisp of a
woman with black hair entered the hall
and touched Harry on the arm. Without
changing a muscle on his face he walked
out and got in the car with her. None
of our crowd has ever seen him since.
* * * *
“Horseless Horseman”: Phillip Island’s
increasing popularity with tourists is due
to the affectionate koalas that roam at
large around the precincts of Cowes town-
ship. No one has done more to preserve
these little marsupials, and no one has re-
ceived less praise for it, than Mrs. F.
Roberts of Broadwater. Once native-
bears were a rarity on the picturesque
island, but in the years preceding the war
the teddies bred up until, because of the
clearing of farming lands, there weren’t
enough manna-gums left to support them.
Then Mrs. Roberts at her own expense
shipped gum-tips daily from the main-
land, and seven years ago brought 200-
acres of land and planted it with saplings.
The area is now enclosed with gates
and concrete posts —there’s no wire yet —
and recently many surplus bears were
liberated in reserves about the mainland.
Between 400 and 500 remain on the island,
and for these and their progeny Mrs.
Roberts has established with her private
donation a trust fund, which has been in-
creased by public gifts, to maintain the
reserve and assure the upkeep of the
koalas. It is called the Edward trust fund,
after her favorite bear, who died recently
and whose stuffed figure is intended for
the Melbourne National museum.

“Tarbush”; The screen door into the
verandah was pushed back against the
wooden wall of the bathroom, and,
through the glass inner door, I saw a
juvenile swallow from the nest on the
bathroom ceiling clinging upside-down
to the wire in the 4in. space between door
and wall. Presently Mum and Dad
Swallow arrived—two lightning curves
and a burst of agitated chirruping—and
landed on top of the screen door. They
talked to Sonny, leaning down, their scalp-
feathers raised in their excitement. Mum
stopped talking first and flew at breath-
taking speed from below through the
narrow wall-door space to show how easy
it was. That didn’t convince Sonny, still
upside-down on the screen. The talking
recommenced, both parents shuffling up
and down, craning down, crests jerking,
chirping and squeaking fit to beat Can-
berra. At last Sonny made the supreme
effort, fluttered, swung and got his beak
over the edge of the door-top. A perfect
“Are you coming in at the kill?”
storm of encouragement followed and,
painfully, he scrabbled his way up till at
last he gained the top. For an exhausted
10 seconds all three posed, heads sunk on
shoulders, on the door. Then Mum fell
off the door. Down she went almost to
the floor; then, in an eye-baffling con-
tinuation of the same flight-curve, she
was back again. Sidling up to Sonny she
popped a fly into his gaping mouth. Then,
the good little boy having been patted on
the head, both parents fell off the door
and almost burnt the air under the
verandah with a dazzling series of dives,
banks, rolls and loops. Sonny, apparently
realising that it was all calculated to show
him how easy this flying really is, sat there
looking bored. When next the old birds
joined him I noticed that Mum had a
feather out of place in her wing coverts,
and, such was the stress of the occasion,
didn’t give a damn about it.
* * * *
“Lower Tops’!”: Who said birds don’t
think? Drove down a bush track at
Breamlea (Vic.), and there by the sand-
duned shore we couldn’t make out why
dozens of swallows were flitting around
the car. Investigation showed that they
were carrying the red mud off our wheels
to make nests in two near-by concrete
pillar-boxes instead of transporting it
half-a-mile from the flat where we had
picked up the wet dirt.
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”: As yet another instance
of the termites’ uncanny instinct for find-
ing a flaw in man’s defences, “Bongo’s”
par. was very interesting (B. 30/11/’49).
But as proof that I and most other
people are wrong in believing the modern,
well-constructed building gives them no
place to find the moisture necessary for
their existence, it doesn’t hold water. And
there is the flaw in his contention: That
fibro gutter did hold water. No matter
how rust-resisting the material of which
the guttering was made, the falls should
have been towards the downpipe—that
is the first principle in roof-work. The
piece of four-by-three left in the gutter
was, no doubt, put there to prevent the
ladder from damaging the guttering while
the work was going on ; but no con-
scientious tradesman would take a ladder
down without removing the obstruction.
Thus the termites entered the building
because of two factors: Shoddy work-
manship and neglect. “Well-constructed
buildings” are not possible when these
unholy twins are present.

“Sth. E.”; If bushland could be kept
free of fire for 20 years all the scrub and
undergrowth would disappear, leaving
good grazing space under the big timber —
that is the contention of forestry officers
in Victoria’s Gippsland Alps country. To
support the claim is the man who has
leased a small bush run in the region for
the past 25 years, and who, with care
and a lot of luck, has kept the area free
from fire. The evidence of old-timers,
and photographs, show that 25 years ago
today’s clean belt of beautiful forest was
a tangled mess of scrub and creeper.
Higher up, the hundreds of square miles
of Hereford runs that in earlier days were
well-grassed, open forest are rapidly be-
coming spoilt by scrub and rubbish, the
result of fire. I have long since learned
the futility of trying to clear bracken-
fern by means of fire, and of the harvest
of work one sows by burning the debris
of dead wattles, etc.. As the fire
germinates the seeds into ready and
prolific growth, its absence, and the short
life-span of the smaller bush, evidently
make the scheme work in reverse. It has
become the practice of most settlements
to burn great strips of adjoining bushland
early in the season as a precaution against
later fires, and this makes the bush yearly
more difficult. The open forest presents
less fire hazard and has surprisingly little
debris, for leaves and bark, falling flat,
soon rot on the warm, moist soil.

“Wonk”: Charlie had worked on the
place for the 40-odd years since he’d left
school. He camped in the hut by the
cowyard, milked the cows at five o’clock,
chased rabbits when he’d finished, and
got his tobacco once a month. He recog-
nised hours by the daylight, seasons by
the temperature, and Christmas by the
hunk of pudding the boss’s missus always
sent down to him on the old tin-plate.
Then one morning Charlie presented him-
self at the kitchen and announced that
he was thinking of leaving. “Wh-at!”
The boss stared at him. “But what’s
happened? Aren’t you satisfied with
things here?” “O’ course,” said Charlie,
kicking nervously at a tuft of rye. “It’s
just that —well, I thought p’raps I might
go ’n’ work in town f’r a month or two,
that’s all,” “But what for?” persisted
the boss. “If it’s more pay you want,
why, I wouldn’t mind” “Aw, cripes
no. No, it ain’t that,” Charlie broke in,
kicking the rye clean out of the ground.
“Only, I bin thinkin’ things over pretty
serious like, these last few munce. ’Course
I don’t want t’ leave y’ in a ’ole or
nuthin’,” he put in hastily. “I’ll wait
a year or two if y’ like, till y’ get some-
body. But” He looked apologeti-
cally at the horizon. “Well, a man’s only

wants t’ get around a bit, an’ see things.
So I thought, if y’ c’d spare me f’r a
few weeks —well then, don’t y’ see, there
wouldn’t be no danger o’ me gettin’ into
a groove?”

“Billy See”: During a long pilgrimage I
have struck a good many recipes for the
mixing of whitewash, from that allegedly
used to prink up the White House at
Washington to the skim-milk, casein-lime
mixture recommended by the agriculture
dept, for the purification of the cocky’s
milking shed. But none comes near the
mixture used in the early days for
weather-proofing the canvas houses of
Boulder and Kalgoorlie. Drinking-water
being so scarce that it was grudged even
for a christening, whitewash had to be
mixed with water from the mines, brine
from 200 ft. underground. Basically a
saturated solution of common salt, this
fluid also carried generous proportions of
many other salts, those of magnesium
being prominent. Mixed with lime,
which is an oxide of calcium, these salts
entered into a definite chemical combina-
tion which produced a whitewash akin to
a cement, not to be rubbed off with the
finger, with difficulty even with a wire
brush, and resistant to sun and rain for
years. The longer this wash was kept in
liquid form the better it became. Knew
one old-timer who made a living selling
it. He had several 400-gallon tanks
which he kept full, using water from a
near-by water-shaft. Guaranteed best was
a wash that had been a month in solution.
THE WILD SWANS.
, ba y lies under a mist of grey,
~But the day on the plains is tine,
ihe swamps are calm and the black swans float
Where the sunlit waters shine:
When Flinders stood on a granite peak
the You Yangs bleak and bare
He °°* on those shining swamps below
And the wild swans floating there.
And there were times when the swans swam
fast,
Out where the water’s clear,
•Beyond the reach of a stealthy tribe
A:nd the flight of a deadly spear. „
they watched lost Buckley go with the tnoe
Naked and browned by the suns.
To take to himself a dusky bride
In glades where the Barwon runs.
From the gloomy depths of the northern range
Where the tall blue mountains stand
a ™e Hume and Hqvell to reach the end
Of the long track overland;
They pitched their camp by the reedy swamp
At close of a summer’s day
And the black swans floated far and stared
At the tent and tilted dray.
And the floating swans saw Batman go
Along with his trusty band
To find the chiefs of a roaming tribe
„ Put there by the forest land;
With crude marks made on a parchment spread
On the trunk of a fallen tree
He bought their land for some trinkets cheap,
As far as the eye could see.
And the wild black swans went floating out
And gazed at the reedy brink
When the squatter’s bleating flocks came down
To the water’s edge to drink;
They floated out where the swamp is wide
And back to the reeds again,
They saw the close of a lost dark age
That crept from the timeless plain.
The rains have been and the swamps are full,
There’s a sea-tang in the air,
The gulls fly in from the shore to feed
Where the soil is turned by the share;
It’s a long way back when Buckley passed,
Where the dusky tribe has gone,
But the You Yangs grey on the swamps still
gaze
And the wild black swans float on.
VICTORIA.

“Bo”: It was euphemistically called in
the district a creek —Tolley’s Creek —
though the occasions on which it con-
tained water were, in the sub-standard
rainfall country around Bubbelgum, very
rare. Even after rain only a trickle came
past the Tolley property. Tolley never-
theless regarded the Mentation in his
patch of earth as a special gift for which
the Divinity had singled him out, and
framed on his wall was a shire map in
which the alleged stream bearing his
family’s name had been heavily traced in
red ink. At dinner that day he had been
impressing on a visitor the strong irriga-
tional possibilities of his pet; his interest
aroused, the visitor suggested that they go
to inspect the stream. It was then that
Tolley’s face gave evidence that he was
about to crawfish. “Well,” he said slowly,
after a pause, “y’ see it’s this way. If y’d
have come here yestiddy it would ha’ bin
worth inspectin’, an’ if y’d ha’ lobbed
here tomorrer it might’ve bin even better.
But t’day—well, y’ see, it’s like this: that
swine of a Harry Greaves—y’ passed his
block on the rise a mile or so up the
road —thinks he’s got as much right to use
the crick as the bloke it’s named after,
just because part of it happens to go
through his joint. I see him this mornin’
givin’ his horse a drink in it, an’ whenever
the cow does that my bit of it goes bone-
dry!”
♦ * * *
“Blime”: Cockie Brand rode into his
far paddock and stared round inquiringly.
Then, spotting a movement up the hill,
he rode to the top to again search around
the apparently-empty region. He went
on to the back fence, returned down a
far gully and zigzagged through a stretch
of bush. After a time he made down
the creek to a small hut on the flat. He
went in and inspected the interior, felt
the ashes in the fireplace, nodded at a
"You may draw her as she is, hut she refuses to pose! in the nude."
coat and a fresh loaf on the table, then
rubbed his forehead and began another
tour of his property. Four hours later
he turned on to the town road and struck
out for the pub. “That new hand o’
mine been in here?” he asked the pro-
prietor. “No.” “Heard anything of him
being in town these last few days?”
Again the publican shook his head.
Cockie turned away and presently entered
a door further up the street. “Hey,
George, that new overseas bloke y’ sent
me,” he began. “Is he a good worker?”
“Tiptop, they tell me,” came the reply.
“Well, I dunno,” Cockie puzzled.
“ ’Course he ain’t been out here long. Sure
y’ explained the conditions to him
prop’ly?” “ ’Course I did,” said the other.
“I told him he had to camp in the hut
and catch the rabbits in your paddock,
and you had to pay him five pounds a
week and ‘find’ him.” “Yair, an’ that’s
the point, George,” growled Cockie. “Do
y’ think the silly cow knew what it
meant —that last bit?”
♦ * ♦ *
“Mat’s Mate”: Not far from Uran-
quinty there’s a creek the name of which
I disremember. It had water in it the
summer we found it, we had money, a
week’s tucker and a desire for rest, so
we picked a spot on that creek and settled
down. The wheat was ripe, and it wasn’t
long before cockies started dropping in
on us to see if we wanted work. Because
we didn’t we became the more desirable
to them. One brought us an apple-pie
and a jar of cream one Sunday, another
dropped us a shoulder of pickled mutton.
A third invited us to a picnic, and a
fourth offered 30-bob a day and keep.
One day when I was in the camp alone,
Mat having gone up the creek to where
he reckoned he might get a fish, a car
pulled in with two young women in it.
They were a bit shy, said they were look-
ing for the Holbrook Road, and drove off
when I directed them. When Mat came
back I told him about it. He didn’t say
much. Next morning he hurried me into
rolling the gear and moving round a bend
about a mile. Then he left me, muttering
about forgetting his knife or something.
I pitched the camp. Two hours later he
was back. “Gripes,” he said, ‘1 knew
it! Was only watchin’ about an hour, an’
sure enough up comes two tabbies in a
car. I lay low- Y’ oughter seen ’em
lookiq’ puzzled because we wasn’t there.”
“You reckon it was the same two?”
“Betcha life it was, an’ I’ll betcha it’s
their old man’s notion t’ try an’ snare us
into a job. We’ll get a early start in the
mornin’, mate, an’ make for the Monaro.
They don’t grow wheat up there.”

“Boree”: We were collecting the census
out on the Canomodine, and would have
missed her altogether but for an old bag-
man with a billycan full of pups and a
subtle sense of humor. One of the last
of the old people—a genuine Curra-
burrama blonde—she proudly mustered
for our benefit nearly a score of assorted
mongrels, two pet galahs, a goat and no
fewer than 11 shy offspring, most of them
black, some brown, one with a flaming
crop of red hair. We managed to obtain
at least hazy details of most of the in-
formation we sought, but the question
of paternity brought only an embarrassed
grin. In the face of our persistence she
explained. “S’pose you bin catchim
wallop longa tat one circular-saw, boss.
Orrigh’. No more bin savee which one
tooth!”
* * ♦ *
“Old Camp”: Tying a cornsack around
the top of the sled-tank to prevent the
water splashing out (B. 2/11 / ’49) is for
the amateur in such matters, for cornsacks
tend to give the water a cornsacky taste,
Our idea, back in Coolgardie days when
water ranked second to gold, was to float
a few pieces of wide pine-board on the
fluid. This reduced the splashable surface,
and as the same boards were used l many
times there was no unpleasant taste.
* . *
“Moyhu”: Fossicking in a tunnel cut
into the bank of a creek at Beechworth
(Vic.) an old prospector was trapped
when water rose suddenly following a
cloudburst. Quickly sizing up the
situation, a gang of roadmenders working
near by pushed a compressed-air hose to
the end of the hole. Closely following the
wall of water forced outward by the in-
coming air, the entombed man in-
advertently dislodged a lump of rubble
from a long-disused vent, releasing the
tightly-packed air, which hissed its way to
freedom, taking Bill with it. A header
into a mullock heap had little effect on
the rescued one’s appetite or drinking
ability when he attended a party thrown
that night by the roadmenders to
celebrate his escape.
“Looks as if he's been on the grog again."
“Zake”: The unthinking hear in a dog’s
bark just a bark, of no unport other than
as a general warning. Nothing could be
more insulting to the tyke’s intelligence,
for most dogs play upon their only vocal
organ with skill; and, to the initiated, no
message given out by it could be clearer,
The missus of the house doesn’t need to
go and see if it is the boss coming—the
special bark reserved for that joyous
occasion tells her unerringly. I knew an
agriculturist who could tell instantly
whether it was Bob or Joe or Larry pass-
ing along the road by his hound’s bark,
Another bark would bring the confident
remark that “Mick’s put a fox up—pity
it’s so dark,” or “Commorn, there’s a
bullick in the road paddock—here,
Mick?” No invitation printed on a card
could be plainer than the one inherent in
a dog’s bark to come and dig out a rabbit
or go down to the waterhole—this one is
used only on Sundays—for a dip. And
the unmistakable note of anxiety and
worry is always present in the bark, get-
ting close to a yelp, which denotes the
presence or approach of a stranger.

“Billy T.”: There is turmoil at our
tavern. Last week we got a new cook
from Zomerzet or zomewhere, and now
we’ve a waitress from Lithuslovakia or
thereabouts, and when this wench
thoughtlessly put two hard-boiled eggs
in the basket of fresh ones and was
later discovered by Mrs. Bung and
the cook violently shaking all the
eggs and putting them to her ear,
it’s a wonder the resultant dis-
course didn’t addle the lot. It’s got that
way that I creep up to my room and
quietly talk to myself, just to hear my
native tongue; yet the worst sufferer is
old Ben, the rouseabout—he has to live
with them. We were having a few puffs
behind the woodheap. “I’m goin’ off
me rocker, Billy,” he confided. “I can’t
understand a word any of ’em say and
they reckon they can’t understand me;
and if a man wants a decent feed he has
to get it himself. Makes a bloke think
o’ when Mrs. Browne was cook.” His
voice grew softer. “She’d slap a couple
of eggs and a chop on me plate and cover
’em with a pile o’ chips that high. Never
saw anyone make chips like her—always
kept the fat sizzlin’ hot—but a man
couldn’t eat all that much, and every time
she turned her back I’d shove a ’andful
down me shirt an’ sit there with scaldin’
chips burnin’ the guts off o’ me so’s not
to offend her.” I sighed with him ; the
new greasy apparently thinks we’re still on
rations, and our helpings are a la Cripps.

“Tim Burr”: If “Bill N.” (B. 23/11 /’49)
examines the shape of his Murray-pines
he will probably find that most of them
show greater lateral growth on their
northern side, thus giving greater weight
to that side. This is because of the cir-
cumstance that in the general latitude of
Victoria and N.S.W. trees growing in com-
paratively open order, which is natural to
Murray-pines, have a tendency to develop
more wood on the side facing the
strongest sunlight—that is, north. A
cross-section of any well-developed trunk
will generally show thicker annular rings
toward the sunny-side of the tree. Trees
growing in dense natural forests or in the
modern plantation layout, due to the
subdued light below their tops, show
less variation in lateral growth and put
their energy in growing upward toward
the bright sunlight above them,
* * * *
Another bird that mas-
querades for sheer enjoyment (B.
19/10/’49) is the gannet. At the rookery
on Cat Island, off Flinders Island, Bass
Strait, I walked among hundreds of these
glistening white seabirds as they squatted
on the ground just out of pecking distance
of one another, each incubating its soh-
tary egg. When a bird left the nest it
would stretch its neck, pointing its beak
to the sky and marking each movement
with impressive deliberation. Next it
would turn and walk delicately away
with wings raised, and, still regarding the
heavens, launch itself into the air. On
returning it would stride up to its mate
on the nest and rub the other’s beak ;
then the two would waggle their heads
energetically so that the beaks clattered
and scraped together to a deep-throated
cry of “rrah, rrah, rrah.” Perhaps it is
that, with enemies few and food supply
plentiful, the gannet works off its surplus
energy in posturing and in song-and-
dance,

“Lower Tops’!”: During a spell of
steamy weather I watched a fisherman
j n Corio Bay (Vic.) tip a box of flounder

S and above highwater-mark. Then from
the water’s edge he collected the green
seagrass—the long weed the swans pull
up — an d he placed a covering of this Bin.
thick over the dump. “This seaweed’s a
non-conductor of heat,” he said. “Fish

bourne markets also used this method,

“1.M.H.”: It is unjust to speak of
John Ridley “plagiarising John Wrathall
Bull’s ideas of the stripper” (B.
12/10/’49). In 1843, when Bull’s work-
ing model was displayed before the Corn
Exchange Committee in Adelaide, Ridley
was among the spectators. Bull was de-
lighted to find a man besides his sponsor,
Thomas Hudson Beare, who believed in
the efficacy of the stripper he had devised.
It was only after many months of think-
ing on the subject that Bull managed to
work out the plan that Ridley put to
such effect that it revolutionised harvest-
ing. According to Bull’s own account,
neighbors and relatives thought he was
mad in his preoccupation with his
problem. For the rest of his life it was
a satisfaction to such a public-spirited
man to see his implement in operation,
Neither he nor Ridley attempted to take
out a patent, making a present of their
work to the farmers of their day—and
ours.
MENURA.
Step very softly,
Speak no word —
The master singer,
The mocking-bird,
Now with his fellows
Beneath the trees
Dances his dainty
Corroborees.
This way, that way,
With measured tread
Spreading a halo
Over his head;
Clothed in a filmy
Feathery cloak,
Brown as bracken
And grey as smoke.
In a silver cycle,
A. joyous round,
The music rings
From his dancing-mound;
Singing and mocking
And dancing again
Under the fern fronds
Wet with rain.
Why this revel,
This masquerade
Played in the forest’s
Primeval glade?
For some strange audience
Whose commands
Only Menura
Understands?,

* Excludes depreciation reserve.
Chief factors behind the more than
100 p.c. increase in last term’s record
profit were: (1) high metal prices, (2)
.‘increased production, (3) better propor-
tion of overseas to local sales, and (4)
reduction of stock bought when metal
prices were lower. All these things
dwarfed the steep rise in costs, which are
more rigid than metal prices, and there-
fore likely to become troublesome when
the market turns in the wrong direction.
Still, the co. has other strings to its bow,
and a very full programme of new works
is in hand.
Profit claimed last term was £1,068,600
(up £551,758), which is reconciled with
the figure in the table in this way:
1948.
Profit claimed .. .. .. .. £1,068,600
Add: Addition depreciation reserve .. 480,479
Addition gen. reserve .. .. 17,319

£1,672,398
Less: Appropriation new plant, etc... 17,319
Added intangibles .. .. .. 15
Profit per table .. .. £1,655,064
The net addition to depreciation reserve
(making it £4,387,508, or 67.9 p.c. of
book-value of all fixed assets) is included
with profit and then shown as written off.
The £1,168,585 (up £601,763) that re-
mained was 38.9 p.c. on the £3,000,000 of
capital (half of it in 8 p.c. cumulative
participating prefs.), compared with 18.9,
22.5, 13.5, 11.6 and 10.5 p.c. back to 1944.
So nothing was strained when a 10 p.c.
bonus was added to the 15 p.c. div., mak-
ing 25 p.c. for the year. Average distri-
bution for the eight years to 1948 was
11.7 p.c., compared with 14.3 p.c. for
the preceding quinquennium and 1.8 p.c.
for the five years before that.
Next table shows how the price of zinc
(expressed in Australian currency) rose
and fell in the co.’s three principal
markets:
U.S.A. U.K. Aust.
1948, July £AB3 5 5 £A93 15 0 £A22 0 0
„ Nov. 117 9 4
Dee. 132 10 0 40 0 0
1949 June 62 9 1 97 10 0
„ Sept. 72 16 4 78 17 6
„ Oct. 92 10 0 109 7 6
For the year to June 30 last the average
overall price realised for metal exported
(mostly to Britain) was £A97 a ton as
against £A7B for the previous term. The
big leap in the figures since the close of
accounts was due to devaluation of
sterling in September. Since Britain buys
a substantial part of her zinc requirements
in dollar markets, the U.S. is the dominant'
influence in the price structure, though it
might not always remain so. Prospects
of significant expansion of the American
economy appear to be slender, but hopes
are that the influences tending to keep
production and employment around
present levels will win the day.
The smelter at Risdon (Tas.) worked
at 96 p.c. capacity and turned out an
extra 7273 tons zinc, and more by-
products, which mostly fetched higher
prices, too, came from the residue plant:

1949- 343,329 2,366 224 165 1,468
* Includes residues from copper plant.
The new flash-roaster and new contact-
acid plant helped production along.
About 44 p.c. of the zinc was sold over-
seas as against 36 p.c. in the previous
term, the balance being taken by local
consumers at the officially fixed price,
which is equivalent to a subsidy of over
£24 million on the basis of the average
figure received for exports last term.
In addition co. produced 100,491 tons
(up 9635 tons) superphosphate, 26,873
tons (up 9989 tons) sulphuric acid, 2022
tons of EDZA alloy for use in die-casting,
as well as small quantities of cobalt oxide,
zinc sulphate and zinc dust.
At the co.’s own mines at Rosebery,
on the west coast of Tasmania, the mill
handled 126,870 tons (up 1644 tons) of
high-grade (19.9 p.c. zinc) ore for the
following satisfactory results: —-

Residue 76,022 1.93 1.1 0.14 1.35 0.92
In addition 121,956 tons zinc concen-
trates were bought from the big mining
cos. at the Barrier. Ore blocked at Rose-
bery remains at 1,500,000 tons, and the
drill has disclosed continuation of the ore-
bodies.
At Risdon extension of the zinc plant
(lifting capacity to 100,000 tons p.a.) is
proceeding as fast as materials and labor
will allow. A second flash-roaster and
another contact-acid plant are also under
construction, and the wharf is being
lengthened. Preliminary work has begun
on the site for the big sulphate of
ammonia project—first mooted a couple'
of years ago, when it was expected to cost
about £2j million and to take four or five
years to complete. Some of the plant
is on order. Construction is expected to
be retarded by shortage of steel and other
materials.
Shareholders are not likely to be asked
to assist for some time, if at all, as the
following comparison of balance-sheet

The big wad of cash, etc. —the etcetera
is £925,888 of Government bonds and
£10,513 of debentures —was strengthened
by no less than £1,128,568. And only
£363,336 was added to the amount coming
to sundry creditors to help finance addi-
tions totalling £846,134 to all other assets.
The co.’s long-term prospects appear
excellent, but it will be some time before
earning-power of the whole undertaking
is fully developed. Meanwhile, everything
depends upon what happens in the zinc
market and upon the level of costs. The
market for the co.’s scrip has largely
followed the market for the metal;

* Excluding depreciation reserve.
Turnover of this Victorian spinning and
knitting business increased by nearly 35
p.c. last term, due mainly to higher prices,
which took a big leap following with-
drawal of subsidies, the full effects of
which have not yet been felt. The new
factory at Highett, to which idle worsted-
spinning plant was transferred from the
main mill at Coburg over a year ago, also
helped the figures along. Four other
branch factories—at Kyneton, Woodend,
Gisborne and Parkdale —which were set
up since the war to help overcome the
labor problem, are handy contributors to
the pool, too.
The co.’s export business declined, but
locally trading conditions were buoyant.
Gross margins (officially controlled)
narrowed, and all raw material and mill
operating costs continued to rise. Gross
earnings (£320,708) increased by £18,714,
and the net result benefited by £1795 of
the gain, reaching £76,531. The net gain
was after adjusting profit figures in the
table for the three years to 1948 in respect
of female wage subsidies and taxation,
and leaves out of the reckoning a surplus
of £6170 on sale of assets which was
transferred to the depreciation reserve
,(£282,933), making the year’s total addi-
tion thereto £54,795.
Hie £76,531 was enough to pay the
9 p.c. pref. div. and show 50.3 p.c. on the
£80,527 of written-down ord. capital,
compared with 48.1, 52.9, 44.7, nil, 35.4
and 36 p.c. back to 1943. The div. re-
mained at 124- p.c., and has done so for
the last 11 years. It is equivalent to only
•24 p.c. on original ord. capital, of which
16s. a share (£322,000-odd) was jettisoned
in 1925 to cover fire losses, etc., and wipe
out £BO,OOO of goodwill. By 1938 plant
had been both modernised and expanded,
and reduction of the heavy allowance for
depreciation from which the work had
been financed enabled more profit to be
shown. The policy since has been to keep
the div. steady and expand and strengthen
the organisation by building up reserves,
now £340,079, excluding the provision for
depreciation.
To add £73,093 to plant, carry a further
£693,361 of stocks and £98,494 of book
debts, etc., the co. went to its bankers
and others for an extra £788,171:

t Includes tax reserve, divs. payable and contribution
to staff fund. * Includes subsidies claimed but not
received.
Stocks, which include £20,078 of sub-
sidies claimed but not yet received, appear
at not more than cost or market-value,
whichever is the lower. The year’s in-
crease in this item was due largely to the
rise in prices and partly to increased
physical volume. The more-or-less liquid
surplus was £455,487 (down £6631). Still,
when the books closed, there was 235. of
outside money, etc., at risk in the business
for every pound belonging to share-
holders, including the depreciation
reserve. The etcetera in outside liabilities
is a substantial provision (amount not
stated) for tax and other contingencies,
some of which might not eventuate.
Nevertheless, with prices and costs as they
are, it may not be long before it will be-
come expedient to replace the bank over-
draft (now £942,025) with money more
permanent in character.
Although trading conditions locally are
still buoyant, the continued rise in costs
is steadily impairing the co.’s power to
compete with overseas manufacturers,
both inside and outside Australia. And
the struggle promises to become more in-
tense before it gets easier.
The market, which anticipates a lift in
the div. or other benefits, prices the f.-p.
4s. ords. at 13s. 9d. (16s. 3d. a year ago),
giving an immediate return of only 3.6
p.c. on a 12} p.c. div. basis. The pound
prefs. at 355. yield 5.1 p.c. Excluding the
depreciation reserve, net tangible cover
is 41s. prefs. and 20s. lid. Ords.

At today's prices this co.’s scrip is one of
the high-yielding stocks on the market.
That is because investors are doubtful
about what the future holds for the high-
grade furniture and furnishing trades, in
which the co. has long been a front-
ranker. Certainly there is plenty of
money about, and the big post-war home
and other construction programme is yet
far from being overtaken, nor have the
deferred replacement requirements of
hotels, flats, etc., been fully satisfied.
Still, houses are becoming more difficult
to sell, because the rapid rise in costs is
steadily pricing them out of reach of the
middle- and lower-income grpups in the
market. Should the national income get
into reverse gear, the furniture and
ancillary trades might experience a sticky
patch until the price-cost structure re-
adjusts itself.
During the year supplies of china and
glasswear overtook demand and prices
eased a little. Carpets and furnish-
ing fabrics are now available in better
volume, too. Here the price trend in
some lines is still upward, owing to de-
valuation of sterling ; but the background
is fluid, and the cost of conducting busi-
ness continues to rise at what is, under
present conditions, an alarming pace. In
these circumstances, increased turnover
and efficiency have become the keynotes
of profit-earning.
After allowing for depreciation and
taxation, and setting aside an un-
specified amount against a possible
fall in stock-values, the board
wrote the year’s net earnings £7403
stronger at £59,733, best in the co.’s
history. That covered the full contract
rates on both lots of prefs. (£6300) and
14 p.c. on the £381,687 of ord. capital,
compared with 12, 9.9 and 7.9 p.c. for
the three preceding terms. The ord, div.
was lifted from 6 p.c. to 7} p.c., making
the average over the last decade 4.9 p.c.
The 41.9 p.c. of the year’s declared profit
that remained lifted reserves £122,550 in
excess of goodwill (£67,660).
The prefs.—there are 30,000 first 7 p.c.
and 52;500 second 8 p.c.—are subject to
the outmoded N. S. Wales Interest Reduc-
tion Act, under which they have been
rationed since the early 1930’5. Their
minimum rates under the Act are 5.4 p.c.
and 6.2 p.c. respectively, but they advance
with the ords, beyond these points to
their original contract rates. The firsts
therefore got an extra 1 p.c., lifting them
to their full rate, and the seconds an
extra 1.3 p.c., making 7 } p.c., the same as
the ords.

A YEAR OF
SPLENDID
ACHIEVEMENT!
Outstanding Results Are Revealed in the
73rd Annual Report of the T. & G.
NEW POLICIES—II7.OS2 new Life
Policies, assuring £28,690,514, and 12,715
Personal Accident and Sickness Policies,
assuring £4,539,320, were issued. The whole
of the business was written in Australia and
New Zealand, and indicates the confidence of
new and existing Policyholders in the T. & G.
ASSURANCES IN FORCE—In the
Ordinary and Industrial Departments there
are 1,535,000 Policies in force assuring
£195,800,000. That the T. &G. has been
entrusted with the responsibility of providing this
great mantle of protection is striking evidence of
the esteem in which the Society is held.
.INCOME —The Income for the year
exceeded £11,500,000, an increase of more
than £BlO,OOO over the previous year’s total.
SECURITY —The financial position of the
Society is unassailable. The Assets, which are
held in trust to meet payments to Policyholders
as they fall due, increased by £4,790,000 to
£66,500,000.
SERVICE —The T. &G.is a Mutual Life
Society, a truly co-operative institution which
has no shareholders. It renders the utmost
service to its members and settles all claims
promptly. Payments to Policyholders during
the past ten years exceeded £34,867,000, of
which £4,393,000 was paid last year.
GROUP ASSURANCE —A large
number of firms and companies entrusted their
Staff Superannuation and Group Provident
Schemes to the Society. These Schemes are
available on terms most advantageous to both
employers and employees.
A Policy with the T. & G. is a Safe
and Profitable Investment.

movements in a trade climate
that might change suddenly. The
fall in stocks, due partly to pro-
vision against price fluctuations,
suggests a cautious buying
policy. The improvement in the
more -or - less liquid surplus
(£270,111) was £28,768.
The immediate outlook favors
another satisfactory showing at
next balance. Still, for reasons
already explained, the market
prefers to take the long view and
prices the pound ords. at 23s. —
the figure fluctuated between
255. Id. and 19s. 9d. over the
last 12 months. At 235. the re-
turn is 6.5 p.c. on a 1\ p.c. div,
basis. The firsts at 255. 9d. and

Rawang Tin Fields, Ltd.
This one of the Anglo-
Oriental group operates in the
Rawang and Serendah valleys,
Malaya. Delays in delivery of
equipment and other troubles,
including attacks by bandits,
which resulted in the murder of
three European members of the
staff and a special constable last
year, have hampered rehabilita-
tion.
Of the co.’s three dredges.
No. 1. vyag completely dismantled
by the Japs and is of no further
use. No. 2, a 250,000-c.y.-a-
-month all-electric machine on
the Serendah sector, was badly
damaged and didn’t get into
commercial production till May
16 last, No. 3, another all-
electric machine that can dig
300,000 c.y. a month, was got
going in May, 1946, and, except-
ing stoppages for repairs, has
worked continuously since.
Operating results for the last
three years compare as follows:

1949 .. 2292 316.33 .31 16,110
Last terjn yardage and recoveries
were affected by a month’s shut-
down for repairs and by the
slimes and old workings passed
through. Including £9189 of
emergency exes., partly recover-
able from the Government, costs
rose from 7.16 d. to 7.57 d. a yard.
In terms of metallic tin, all-in
costs were £504.5 a ton and the
average price received for ore
£547.7 a ton.
The current year’s results will
benefit by returns from No. 2
dredge. But costs are still rising
—they depencL-largely on prices
of fuel and supplies and upon
wage-rates, which are related to
the market price of rice. And
the London price of tin, which
shot up to £S7SO a ton follow-
ing devaluation, has dropped
steadily since the metal was
given a free market on Novem-
ber 15. Last week the spot price
rose for the first time from
£S6O3 to £S6O4 10s. a ton ; the
forward quote remained at
£5564 10s. a ton. The trouble
is that production continues to
run ahead of commercial con-
sumption. If it keeps on doing
so producers might be forced to
resort to the quota weapon
again. However, there are many
cross-currents in the world’s tin
markets.; At the moment hopes
are that re-emergence of Japan
and Germany will tend to steady
the position,
Co. holds about 2840 acres,
mostly averaging around 0.51 b.
per c.y. It also has a one-third
interest in 55,000,000 c.y. of
0.571 b ground at Bang Toe,
western Siam, not yet equipped.
At end March last current
assets totalled £225,306 and cur-
rent liabilities £43,254. That ex-
cludes a rehabilitation of
£174,300 and the co.’s war-
damage claims (amount un-
stated), not yet finally assessed.
The co. has £876,003 of capi-
tal to feed. Doubtful as to when
divs. will begin to flow again,
the market (Sydney ’Change)
now prices the 10s. shares, which
touched 12s. 6d. in 1948, around
the 6s. mark.
Harrietville (Tr*onoh), Ltd.
This co.’s big 4600-ton all-
electric dredge, equipped with
20 c.f, buckets and capable of
handling 350,000 c.y. a month,
is digging auriferous wash in the
Ovens Valley (Vic.). To date
results have been disappoint-
ing. Apart from rising costs,
which have nearly doubled since
1946, and other difficulties, the
co. appears to have commenced
work at the wrong end of its
property, where an undulating
slate bottom has resulted in
irregular working faces and
interfered with development of
maximum turnover, while tail-
ings have had to be redredged
to get back into virgin ground.
Performances since operations
began again after the war have
been as follows:
Treated, Smelted
'OOO. Gold, Revenue. Loss.
O.y. Oz. £ £
1947 .. 1961.3 3182.7 46,791 28,436

1949 .. 1711.4 9856.6 106,960 13,298
Last term 88 working days were
lost —the bottom tumbler broke
twice and the power transformer
was struck by lightning —part
of the wash was clayey, heavy
boulders were met with, the
working face narrowed, and the
dredge was handling old tailings
for the last four months of the
term. It all meant lower yard-
age and higher costs, which rose
from 7.9 d. to 11.6 d. a yard.
Higher values, 2.76 gr. as against
1.53 gr. for the previous term,
saved the day. After allowing
£7615 for depreciation the profit
was £13,298 (up £12,883), or
2.12 d. per ss. share, equal to
3.5 p.c, on capital.
For the 12 weeks to Sept. 24
last, the dredge, which worked
without interruption, handled
574,300 c.y. for 45640 z. gold. It
is now coming back downstream
on the western side, but until the
tailings are passed through and
virgin ground entered, values are
likely to be below average. The
recent lift in the price of gold
will, of course, make a big dif-
ference. On the basis of last
term’s figures it will increase the
margin of profit from 3.4 d. to
9.76 d. a yard, but rising costs
can be expected to gobble some
of the gain, and last year’s
ground was a little above aver-
age value for the whole property.
At June 30 last current assets
totalled £60,255 and current
liabilities £243,728, of which
£235,000 was loans from the co.’s
London associates on which no
interest has been charged so far.
Paid capital is £375,000 in ss.
shares.j
* * * *
London-controlled North Kal-
gurli (1912), Ltd., will ask share-
holders on December 29 to lift
nominal capital from £120,000
t<* £250,000 by the creation of
1,300,000 new 2s. shares. Issued
and paid capital is now £llO,OOO
in 2s. shares. An immediate
new issue is not proposed, but
the time had arrived when
preparations had to be made for
dealing with a larger tonnage of
ore than was now possible, the
directors say. In May last the
co. bought from North Kalgurli
United Mines, Ltd., one of De
Bernales’s old group, three leases
that formerly separated its
Croesus and Kalgurli area on the
Golden Mile (W.A.), thus giving
continuity of area through the
whole of its properties. There
is talk of a new shaft being sunk
to handle ore from the southern
and downward extension of ore-
bodies now being opened up in
the Croesus. Ore reserves at
January 6, 1948, were put at
1,356,978 tons positive, averag-
ing 6.32dwt, and 449,150 tons
probable, averaging 5.27dwt,
Over the last five months the
price of the co.’s scrip has risen
from 19s. to 28s. 6d. on the
Australian market.

Under New Management
The defeat of the Chifley
Socialists by the return of the
Menzies and Fadden parties at
last Saturday’s elections does
one thing immediately in the
Australian economy it re-
moves, for the present, at any
rate, the menace of socialisation
that has confronted Australian
industry ever since the Curtin
Government took office in 1941,
It will be remembered that even
before Mr, Chifley became
Prime Minister Mr. Curtin pro-
posed to limit the profits of all
industry to 4 p.c. on invested
funds—that was early in 1942.
Ever since then ,the shadow of
Socialism has hung over Aus-
tralian secondary industries, and
a grudging attitude has been
taken wherever an enterprise ap-
peared to be exceptionally pro-
gressive, regardless of how
efficient it might have been.
Price-control today ig ad-
ministered by the States, and in
three of them Socialism still
reigns. Price-control has been
a weapon of Socialism, but it
can function only so long as all
States control prices. If the
supply of essential goods under
a Federal Liberal-C.P. Adminis-
tration rises to the point where
price-control is no longer eco-
nomically necessary, then the
non-Socialist States, by abandon-
ing it, can wreck the Socialist
controls in N. S. Wales, Queens-
land and Tasmania. And that
is assuming that the McGirr
Socialist party remains in power
in N. S. Wales after the middle
of next year, which is most un-
likely. Only the Socialists will
want to retain price-controls
once free competition brings its
own check to overcharging for
goods. In the United States the
abandonment of price-controls
eventually brought an excep-
tionally high level of production
and, in many cases, lower prices
to the consumer.
The things Australian industry
seeks most of all are fair prices
for its products, a restraint of
“Well, let 'em WAIT for their change!”
inflationary production costs,
adequate supplies of labor and
raw materials and a reduction in
taxation. If there is inefficiency
in any industry the sooner it is
made to realise it by open com-
petition the better; and adequate
competition will only come when
there is enough coal and man-
power to keep all industry work-
ing at the level set by public
demand. The Liberal-C.P. Gov-
ernment has as its initial indus-
trial task the dealing with Com-
munist obstruction on the coal-
fields.
Until now investors have not
been adequately compensated
for the depreciation in the Aus-
tralian pound so far as increases
in dividends are concerned. It
is only recently that average
dividends, expressed in present-
day money, have approached
pre-war levels (expressed in pre-
war pounds). That is mani-
festly unfair when the rise in the
basic wage is considered. But
industry will not be the first to
benefit under an anti-Socialist
Government. All production
must. first of all be increased ;
once that is evident in better
living standards generally, how-
ever, there should be no be-
grudging an adequate return on
the capital invested in industry
over a long period. In calculat-
ing that return, the inflation that
has taken place in asset-replace-
ment values must be a prime
consideration. Many concerns
that have been writing-off plant
on the basis of pre-war values
are now finding that their <J e '
preciation funds are inadequate
for replacement purposes. The
question of depreciation provi-
sion must be given additional
attention by the taxation and
price-control authorities. And
the value of pre-war pounds in-
vested to return only “Chifley
quids” deserves full considera-
tion in respect of profits and
dividends.
The double-taxation of divi-
dends—that is, no rebate of tax
is now allowed a shareholder
paying full personal tax on his
dividends —should be reviewed.
And the recent private-company
tax law wants overhauling. There
are reasons to believe that it was
enacted in a fit of the customary
Chifley pique and intolerance.
Freed from Socialist inhibi-
tions and doctrine, and taxed
sufficiently but not penally, there
is a wide field ahead of all effi-
cient Australian industry. There
are great shortages of materials
and equipment to be overcome,
and that means hard work; but
if the Australian people really
want full employment on. the
basis of a fair day’s work for
fair pay, then they should have
no fear of unemployment for
many years to come. Our many
primary and secondary industries
should be prosperous, and in-
vestors and wage-earners should
share in the prosperity.
One thing it is to be hoped
that the Menzies Government
does, and that is to put some
stuffing back into the Australian
pound. That may be difficult
to do at once—the inflationary
momentum is still on, and has
recently been stimulated by the
depreciation of the pound in re-
lation to the dollar. But the
holders of Commonwealth
securities must be considered,
especially as the world trend of
interest rates seems to be rising.
In Australia interest rates have
been kept down only by artificial
controls. To restore value to
the pound the rise in prices musf
be checked, and that implies a
greater output per man per week.
The fact that the Australian
pound now exchanges for only
$2.24, against $3.20 before Sep-
tember 19, should be given full
attention by the new Adminis-
tration, and the point taken
into consideration that if we
come to par with sterling our
pound will still change for only
$2.80. While The Bulletin was
opposed to an alteration in the
ratio of £125 Auqjralian to £lOO
sterling before the September de-
valuation of sterling, the infla-
tionary potentialities of the pre-
sent situation are not to be
ignored.
The agricultural and pastoral
industries, representing Aus-
tralia’s biggest exporters, must
come to recognise the national
interest involved in this question,
and not merely take sides as a
self-interested section. Many
pasforalists are all in favor of
our coming to parity with
sterling. The matter must be
investigated in the light of its
effect on all private enterprise.
The ultimate decision will
depend upon many factors, and
all need to be taken into con-
sideration. The great need will
be for the exercise of tolerance
and commonsense in all relevant
deliberations.
A check to inflation in com-
modity prices would meanithat
ordinary shares in industries
listed on the Stock Exchanges
would not be bought so readily
as protection against the infla-
tion that robs the holder of
consols, mortgages, bank de-
posits, life-assurance policies,
etc. Thus one of the factors
prominent in the Stock Exchange
buoyancy of the past few years
would be removed. But instead
of this merely protective demand
we should get a demand for in-
dustrial equity shares based
upon industry’s capacity to earn
reasonable dividends for its
shareholders, this capacity being
based on the nation’s increased
prosperity as calculated in real
terms —that is, in its produc-
tivity and true standard of living.
On the last day before the
elections the Australian Stock
Exchanges closed on a confident
note. Broken Hill Prop, shares,
which had touched 525. 3d. at
one stage, were firm at around
51s. 9d., a rise of Is. 9d. in the
week, and about 10s. above their
lowest price this year. On the
basis of pre-issue quotations, this
was the equivalent of nearly 595.,
which was only a little below the
highest price this year. When
B.H.P. shares were in their new-
issue blues a few months ago
the stock was strongly recom-
mended here, with statistical
substantiation. Australian Con-
solidated Industries was another
strong stock last week, and the
tone among industrials generally
was buoyant.

LONDON AIRMAIL
From Herbert Holman
Opinions vary as to the merits
of the Labor party’s recent
Speakers’ Handbook as a true
expression of the state of affairs
in Britain. It will be sufficient
here to quote two. According
to Mr. Michael Foot, member
of the Labor-party executive,
writing in the “Daily Herald,”
it is the “best handbook of hard
facts ever put on the market.”
The “Economist,” on the other
hand, states that the handbook
“reflects the Labor Government’s
chief and quite unconscious in-
tellectual weakness: the lack of
any effective contact between
their understanding of Britain’s
economic position in the world
and their home policy.”
The publication, which runs to
nearly 500 pages, should prove
to be an indispensable vade-
mecum to those Socialists who
combine a gift of the gab with
their political aspirations. For
here is given the answer to every
likely query, thus saving time in
research. Speakers can look up
the subject index and refer to
the relevant material. They will
then find their argument ex-
pressed in a jargon familiar to
themselves and their audience—
with nearly every theme a simple
tune readily admitting of facile
variation.
For instance, if they turn to
“overseas trade” they will learn
that bulk purchase is essential
to Commonwealth development.
Of devaluation, there are two
ways of solving its problems:
the Tory way, which is to create
unemployment and slash wages ;
and the Labor way, which is to
spread the load the whole
nation. Nationalisation is a
word that is used sparingly in the
handbook. Instead, it may be
learned that public ownership
“aims at providing a better ser-
vice to the consumer, a fair deal
and proper status to the worker
and maximum contribution to
national prosperity. In all these
tasks it is beginning to succeed.”
(The italics are mine; even
Socialists are chary of affirming
that nationalisation has been a
success.) The iron-and-steel
industry is a “citadel of capi-
talist power.” The fact that the
annual cost of the National
Health Service exceeds the esti-
mated £200,000,000 by 83 per
cent, is explained as “mainly due
to the fact that more people than
originally forecast are using the
service and that there has been
more untreated disease than was
expected.” And so on.
Of other political parties, the
Liberals escape censure and even
mention. Presumably they are
not considered to be a threat, in
Great Britain, to the continuance
of Socialist power. Communists
appear to be troublesome only
in other countries. Conserva-
tives have two whole chapters to
themselves, and their very exist-
ence is made to give an under-
tone of snarling and diabolical
villainy as well as a beginning
and end to the book. The intro-
duction states that “the ruling
class will be making their last
stand. Defeat for them means
final eclipse.” And a totalitarian
Socialist State?
“Mutualisation”
That innocent victim of Labor,
the insurance industry, has
escaped—for a time at any rate
—the imminent threat of nation-
alisation. This is said to be due,
not to the industry’s own good
conduct, but to three main
factors: the Co-operative move-
ment, Mr. Herbert Morrison and
Sir Stafford Cripps. No more
striking paradox can exist in
contemporary politics than that
of the attitude of the Co-op. to-
wards the Government. Nearly
as big a force behind the Labor
party as the Trades Union Con-
gress, the Co-op. is solidly
against nationalisation where
its own interests are concerned.
Tate and Lyle are fighting hard
to save sugar from the Socialist
grasp. Their largest single share-
holder and best customer is the
Co-op. Similarly, the Co-
operative Insurance Society has
used that old bugbear of
Socialism, “power politics,” to
persuade the Government to
allow them to remain bosses in
their own house. Mr, Morrison,
as chief electioneering strategist,
has seen the political dangers
arising from 65,000 convassers
(themselves hostile or suspici-
ously neutral to nationalisation)
calling upon most working-class
homes. Sir Stafford Cripps, who
alone appears to have taken a
broad view, is reported to have
pointed out that foreign confi-
dence in British insurance would
sink so that dollar earnings
(amounting to about $80,000,000
a year net) would suffer.
The outcome, “mutualisation,”
adds more confusion to the scene
as well as a new horror to the
English language. It scarcely
affects the Co-op., and is not
likely to benefit the industrial
policyholders of proprietary
companies. Rather is the de-
cision a device on the part of the
National Exacutive Committee
of the Labor party to save face
and avoid admitting defeat.
Confidence within the industry
is nb higher. The threat of
nationalisation has affected the
market. The two pledges given
by Sir Stafford Cripps and the
one given by the Prime Minister
only eight months ago to the
effect that “ordinary” and
general business would be left
alone are openly held in con-
tempt. Insurance managements
feel that the Socialists are after
the funds and that the rest is
claptrap. “Mutualisation” would
mean a Parliamentary bill and a
national board to co-ordinate.
The Labor party has also stated
that it would ensure that the in-
vestment of insurance funds
would be in the “public interest.”
These funds are not inconsider-
able. Industrial assurance
funds would provide about
£750,000,000 and “ordinary”
funds about twice that sum. It’s
anybody’s guess what “public
interest” means.
Memorial in Music
Sir John Barbirolli only rarely
brings the Halle orchestra south,
which is very much London’s
loss. For the standard of
orchestral playing in the capital,
where it should be first-rate, too
often is slipshod, perfunctory
and under-rehearsed. The last
visit (November 19), when the
orchestra travelled to London
and back in a single day, was not
a happy one. Sir John brought
his players to London to pay
tribute to the memory of Ginette
Neveu, who had been closely
associated with the Halid
orchestra for two years, and who
had the double gift of musician-
ship and a happy, unaffected
personality.
Here was tragedy, wanton and
sudden, expressed in music to
which Sir John gave a dark and
meditative interpretation. The
programme was chosen to
portray the moods of sorrow,
and the means of expression was
given to Mile. Neveu’s own in-
strument, the violin, and its
fellow-strings. Dr. Vaughan
Williams’s Fantasia on a Theme
of Thomas Tallis was poignant,
wistful mourning; the brief
evocative nocturne from Faure s
“Shylock” was muted elegy ; the
Mozart G Minor Symphony was
tumultuous, majestic and sombre;
Sir John specially arranged one
of Bach’s last works, the chorale
prelude “In Our Hour of
Deepest Need,” for horns and
lower strings; and, finally,
Richard Strauss’s “Metamor-
phosen” for 23 solo strings, fitly
expressed an old man’s reflective
threnody, based on a figure from
the “Eroica” Symphony.
The sadness of the occasion
apart, such string playing has not
been heard in London these
many months.
(Ginette Neveu and her
brother Jean were killed in an
air accident in the Azores on
October 28.)


Marks's Cutter
By E.O. SCHLUNKE
ILLUSTRATED BY
UNK WHILE
IT was a great
day when Marks’s
chaff-cuttirig out-
fit came to cut up
the hay stocked in
our “Long Two-
hundred Acre” pad-
dock. It looked like
a train, but a
magical train which
ran without rails
along the roads and through our pad-
docks.
It came so slowly that we couldn’t be-
lieve it would ever arrive. First the
great steam traction engine with its
wheels twice as high as a man, puffing
out smoke and leaking little jets of steam
all over it; and reeking of oil and steam,
and wood-fire and hot metal. Then the
cutter, not so big or impressive, running
on its four small wheels, with a curved
iron roof built over it, and a noticeable
lean to the left.
Then the “travelling kitchen,” made of
galvanised iron and mounted on a low
platform wagon.
Then the long
steambox with
two wheels at the
back end and the
front attached to
the cook’s galley.
Last of the
train, Marks’s old
T - model Ford
car, full of his
piratical - looking
crew, being
towed because there was no point in
rushing on ahead.
And following so far behind that we
were not quite sure if it belonged to the
outfit, a fat waddling horse pulling a
Furphy water-cart, with the “wood-and-
water-Joey” sitting unhappily on the
shaft. *'
NEXT day we went to see them work-
ing, having got ourselves into a fine
state of excitement from hearing the
steam whistle. Our father said it tooted
too often; they must be having trouble’
if they were starting and stopping so
much. He walked so fast across the
stubble that we had a job keeping up
with him —he always got upset if any-
thing wasn’t going properly on his farm.
As we got near we could smell all the
hot engine smells again with a new one
added, the sweet, damp smell of steamed
hay. Despite the steaming there was a
lot of dust about. It came streaming
down the wind from the cutter, a million
glittering and gleaming particles from
the lacquered wheat stalks, looking like
the stuff our mother sprinkled over the
Christmas-tree. We knew, however,
from unhappy experience, that the stuff
would itch our skins intolerably, so we
began to bear away to the right to
avoid it. But Father kept on straight
ahead.
“You don’t want the men to think
you’re softies?” he said. And we had to
follow him. But we held our shirt
collars tightly round our necks, and
rushed through as fast as we could run.
Marks came to speak to our father.
A tall man with sagging shoulders.
His face was a mottled red all over,
which looked very strange to us because
we’d been brought up among sober
people. He wore a grin that looked most
villainous, showing a few teeth here and
there, grown grotesquely long because
there were none opposite to keep them
worn down. His hands and clothes were
black with grease.
Father said gruffly, “Having a bit of
trouble.?” and he stared at Marks as if
he didn’t approve of his * light-hearted
grin.
“Elevator chain broke in the middle
of the steamer and we ha’d trouble getting
it out,” Marks said. Then he turned a
roving, rolling and roguish eye at us boys
and said, “Pity one of youse wasn’t here
to crawl up the steamer.”
We looked at the steamer with popping
eyes; a long tube made of galvanised
iron, with a procession of sheaves of hay
running up through it to the cutter, and
steam coming out of all its crevices. We
moved over close behind our father for
protection.
Marks began to talk to our father of
less terrifying matters, so we had a good
look at how his outfit worked. Where
the hay came out of the steamer a fearful,
whiskery old. fellow perched on a high,
rocking platform took charge of it and
pushed it into the mouth of the cutter.
He battled with the hay and the cutter as
with mortal enemies, his face contorted
with rage. Every now and then he
looked up at the skies and cursed the
cutter in venomous tones and with a
noticeable foreign accent, but all the
time his hands flew dexterously. The
band-cutter, noticing our astonishment,
said:
“Mad old , but the only man in
the country who can get more than half
a ton an hour through her.”
At the other end of the cutter where
the chaff came out, two men wearing
only shorts and sandshoes sewed up the
bags deftly, pushing the needle in and
pulling it through in one quick move-
ment ; then, hoisting the bags on their
shoulders, they ran up the pyramid of
stacked chaff as nimbly as monkeys.
C? UDDENLY there was a bang and
then a grinding noise in the bowels
of the cutter, and geysers of chaff were
spewed out of various orifices. All the
men round the
machine yelled,
their faces show-
ing various de-
grees of annoy-
ance, because
, they were on
, piecework; and
the engineer 'ran
to stop the engine,
Marks alone
looked good-
humored. “Only
the riddlebox,” he said cheerfully; “fix
that in a minute.”
But the men looked at each other in
the sudden silence and condemned their
souls if they knew why they stayed with
such an old rattletrap of an outfit.
We looked at our father to see how
he was taking all this swearing, because
he was very strict with us that way. But
he seemed to be only concerned about
getting the machinery going again.
Marks and the enginedriver undid some
bolts, pulled off parts of the cutter and
let a cascade of
chaff flow out.
Then the engine-
driver crawled in
among the chaff,
regardless of itch
and irritation, to
screw and ham-
mer.
A dejected -t
looking man with-
a down - curving
mouth joined
Father; he was
the teamster who
carted the chaff
to the railway-
station, He tried
to curry favor with Father by telling him
he had once had a farm of his own but
had lost it through sheer bad luck. But
Father looked as if he didn’t believe any
part of the story, so the teamster started
sneering at Marks and his outfit. Father
hardly bothered to answer him, so he
got a chaffbag and began to bag up the
chaff that spilled out of the cutter, for
his horses, watching Father to see if he
was going to make him pay for it.
Presently the enginedriver emerged
with chaff leaking out of his sleeves and
trousers. They slammed the parts back
and blew the whistle. The men rose
slowly from where they were sitting and
said cynically:
“How long will she go this time?”
The wood-and-water-Joey came trudg-
ing along with a load of water
slopping out of the Furphy. He stopped
about ten yards from the engine notwith-
standing the enginedriver’s beckoning
and shouting to him to bring it within
reach of his hose,
“Come and get it yourself,” he shouted
back, and retreated with an anxious eye
on the steam-pressure gauge.
He was a very melancholy individual
with a long, flattened nose, no teeth, and
ragged clothes
“She’ll blow pp and kill everybody one
of these days,” he told us; “they’ve been
dodging the boiler inspector for years.
Only last week one of the pipes burst
just when I was backing up the water
cart.”
He lifted his rag of a sleeve and said:
“Look.” The skin had peeled off the
entire length of his arm. We didn’t feel
so contemptuous of his cowardice after
that, but we gazed admiringly at the
enginedriver, who was clambering up
and down all the time. He started a
pump to get the water out of the cart
into the engine, and the extra strain
slowed the cutter down to half-speed.
All the crew glanced apprehensively
across at the engine.
THE next day when we came home
from school the outfit was silent.
We ran down to see why, and found the
engine surrounded by heaps of raked-
out ashes and pools of rusty water. The
enginedriver was somewhere inside the
stiU blisteringly hot engine, trying to find
out what had put the fire out. Marks
was standing by with his grin, saying re-
assuringly to his men:
“Jt’s only a pipe. That boiler’s all right
for another fifty years.”
“Fifty years, my foot,” one of the bag-
sewers said, and the others laughed in
rueful agreement. Marks laughed too.
The enginedriver came out feet first,
as red-hot and dripping as a well-boiled
yabbie coming out of the pot.
“It’s only a boiler pipe,” he said,
smiling at Marks despite his distress.
“Hand me a Stillson and I’ll go in again
and undo it.”
The others said, “You’ll kill yourself.”
After he’d gone in again Marks said
confidentially to the men, “He’s a good
boy.”
The enginedriver had to come out
twice for air, but in about half an hour
he had the broken pipe out.
“Have to go to town now for a new
one,” he said.
There was a chorus of yells: “Room
for me?” “Take me too?” and rush to
the car. It was full when Marks arrived,
struggling into a torn pullover.
“Ah, you beggars,” he said, “I don’t
mind taking a few of you along, but will
you be ready to come out again?”
All the men were prepared to pledge
their chance of salvation. Marks looked
at them unbelievingly and hopelessly,
but still grinning.
“Ah, you
beggars,'’ he said
again, “if I find
any of you, you’ll
be blind, and no
use all to-
morrow.”
“You’ll have to
throw us out,”
said the biggest
bag-sewer, getting
a good grip on a
hood support.
Marks gave a
resigned shrug
and squeezed a
couple of men
over so that he
could get behind the wheel.
EARLY next morning the cutter was
still idle. We ran down before
breakfast and saw that the Ford had not
returned. The men who had stayed be-
hind were still asleep. Strelitz, the
feeder, in his clean white tent; the cook
in his galley; quite a colony on their
stretchers under flies attached to the
teamster’s wagon; but the wood-and-
water-Joey seemed to have no gear at
all, and camped in a stook of hay with a
couple of chaffbags for blankets.
When we were nearly at school we met
the car; the young enginedriver at the
wheel, with Marks leaning heavily on
him, and in the back a heap of tangled
limbs, trunks and heads. When we got
home that night our mother was in a
scandalised state.
“Don’t you go down to the cutter,”
she said. “Mr. Marks couldn’t find
more than half his men last night, and
this morning he went to the police and
they gave him enough men from the cells
to make up his team,”
We sneaked down as soon as she for-
got to keep an eye on us, but it was hard
to pick out the jailbirds from the rest
of the .crew. The engine and cutter were
running well, but the output was slow.
Half the men were blundering about
dizzily, several flat out where they had
fallen. Many of them
were more or less
damaged, and even
the enginedriver had
a black eye.
On the following
afternoon the outfit
was still running
well and the new
men looking less
awkward at their
jobs. It seemed as if Marks’s luck had
changed.
BUT then we saw a man come wheel-
ing a bicycle between the stocks, in-
appropriately dressed for summer
cycling in a town suit, with thick woollen
socks pulled over the ends of his trousers.
He leaned his bicycle against Strelitz’s
tent and carefully dried his face and the
inside of his collar. He wiped his hands
and then strode deliberately across to
Marks. The original members of the
crew looked significantly at each other.
The teamster, always eager to tell some-
thing to Marks’s detriment, came over to
us with a malicious grin on his face.
“It’s the bailiff,” he said. “His wife
always keeps dunning Marks for main-
tenance money.”
Some of the other men, possibly with
matrimonial trouble of their own, were
all sympathy for Marks.
“The lousy bitch,” they said. “Always
at him as soon as he starts to earn a bit
of money.”
“If mine did that,” said another, “I’d
cut her bloody throat.”
We were vastly interested in this
glimpse into real-life drama. We stared
at the bailiff and edged a bit closer to
hear what he was saying. He was a fair,
slight man with a mild and pleasant face,
and he spoke as if he was merely collect-
ing orders for groceries, or something
like that.
“If you just sign this paper,” he was
saying helpfully, “Mrs. Marks will be
able to get the money straight from the
produce merchant who bought the hay.”
It seemed to be a very simple transaction.
But Marks was grinning and swallow-
ing and waving his hands about un-
certainly. He pushed his hat back to
scratch his head, and when we saw that
his hair was white we were suddenly
very sorry for him.
“Come on,” said the bailiff briskly.
“I’ve got a long way to ride home. It’ll
be all right.”
Marks wiped a greasy hand on his
trousers and took the pen.
“By cripes, I hope so,” he said.
He didn’t grin so much when the men
began to chip him. He stroked his jaw
thoughtfully with his black hands, and
said:
“I don’t know how it will turn out, I
signed one of them papers before, to get
you blokes wages.”
“That will be her funeral,” one of the
wife-haters said joyfully.
But the decrepit old wood-and-water-
Joey said ominously, “My word, you’ve
done it now.”
AT the tea-table that night our mother
was inclined to condemn Marks, but
Father had the severest ideas about wives
who took the law against their husbands.
After that there was always something
exciting going on at the cutter. They
had their breakdowns every couple of
days, but we were now more interested
in the real-life drama. What we didn’t
see we heard about from the teamster,
who seemed to be having the time of his
life.
The bailiff came out again, gave
Marks a severe lecture and got him to
sign another and different paper. The
wood-and-water-Joey was shocked when
he heard about this; he seemed to have
a wide knowledge of the various papers
people could sign to their detriment.
Several days later two severe and out-
raged men accompanied the bailiff.
They tried hard to make Marks go to
town with them, but after he had refused
defiantly several times, and called to the
“boys” to come over and hear what
“they” were trying to do to him, the

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
FOR A GREATER EMPIRE.
In shaping their policy for
next year’s general elections
Britain’s Conservatives have
put more emphasis than has been
noted for many a year on the
necessity of all those involved
combining anew to build a yet
greater, actively united Empire
(or Commonwealth).
This was one of the outstand-
ing features of the Conserva-
tives’ annual conference, at
which the following resolution
was carried unanimously;
That this conference wholeheartedly
welcomes the statement of Conserva-
tive Imperial policy. While grudging
to no other State or group of States
the right to make their own tariff
arrangements, it insists that Great
Britain and the British Commonwealth
and Empire must have full freedom
to_ exercise that same right, and main-
tains that the future safety and pros-
perity of the whole Commonwealth
depend upon a policy of Empire
development under a system of
mutual preference in its widest sense,
covering industry and agriculture,
finance, shipping and aviation.
To that expression of policy
can be appended extracts from
speeches in support by present
Conservative members of Par-
liament or prospective candi-
dates :
Mr. G. Wilson (prospective
candidate) said the Conserva-
tives could give a message to
each nation of the Common-
wealth; “Unite and live.” If
they wanted to get the best from
Empire co-operation it must be
encouraged by mutual prefer-
ences in the widest sense. Such
a policy was not hostile to the
United States or to Europe; it
was not hostile to the British
farmer, who should be given
first place for hi§ produce in the
home market.
Mr. A. Nutting, M.P. —“We
must re-create our wealth in the
British Empire and Common-
wealth. On British soil through-
out the sterling area lay untold
and uncounted resources of food
and raw materials, untouched,
untapped and undeveloped.” He
declared that one per cent, of
south-west Australia was under
cultivation; in Western Aus-
tralia and Tasmania there was
wood which could be paid for
in sterling, while Mr. Bevan
continued to complain, because
of a shortage of dollars, about
the shortage of timber for house-
building. There was no will in
the Socialist party to develop the
Empire. The British Empire
must work together, progress to-
gether and expand together.
‘The challenge of our age is
whether we are great enough
and brave enough and young
enough to open the door on all
this opportunity and expansion,”
Mr, L. Hore-Belisha said it
would for ever remain a mys-
tery why the Socialist Govern-
ment had not made it its first
external act to call the members
of the [British] Commonwealth
formally together, confront them
with the problems of the future
and ask them to work together
in peace as they had done in
war. The age of small nations
had gone. Britain was never a
small nation: her greatness lay
in her leadership of the Com-
monwealth group of nations.
“By developing that group we
could stand in the world stronger
than America and stronger than
the U.S.S.R. This is not an ex-
clusive policy, but a policy
which stands to benefit Europe
and the rest of the world.”
Mr. O. Stanley said it was
asked whether such a policy had
to be exclusive, whether it meant
throwing over all the many ad-
vantages of close association
with the United States, or that
they would be unable to take a
leading part in bringing together,
politically and economically,
those nations outside the Iron
Curtain which must be such a
powerful buffer in the defence
of peace.
Even if they thought it was
exclusive, he added ; even if they
had to answer this question in
the affirmative, they would still
make a choice of the Empire
first, but it was a choice that
they would have to make with a
heavy heart. He did not believe
that the choice had to be made.
A system of Empire priorities
and development was neither in-
consistent with association with
the United States nor with the
States of Western Europe. There
was only one way in which
Britain could regain economic
independence: that was as the
centre and leader of a closely-
knit economic Empire.
That, he insisted, was not in-
consistent with an approach to
Western Europe. “It meant that
we could not have a tight, de-
tailed, formal political and eco-
nomic Constitution, but these
European nations, which them-
selves were centres of empires,
would not for one moment wish
us to abandon our Imperial
destiny for the sake of co-opera-
tion with them.” He reaffirmed
his own belief in the future
greatness of the British Empire.
“It would not be the same Em-
pire as in the past; it would not
be the Empire of the eighteenth
century that went down to ruin
at Yorktown and Saratoga ; it
would not be the Empire of
Kipling and the Diamond Jubi-
lee—nothing was more fatal
than to try to make history re-
peat itself. But this new Empire,
an Empire bound by community
of interest, an Empire resting on
mutual agreement, had as great
a part to play in the future as
ever the British Empire played
in the past.”
Dismantling Folly.
Though the Western occu-
piers, at their most recent
Paris conference, apparently
agreed to further cut down the
dismantling of factory plants in
Germany, the dismantling “is
Baltimore (U.S.A.) “Sun.”
BABY'S FIRST FOOTSTEPS.
hot, and never will be, for-
gotten.”
Thus a “Manchester
Guardian” correspondent on the
spot, leaving no doubt about his
own views of the issue:
“History alone will judge
whether an economically non-
sensical dismantling programme
has made political sense. ‘Eco-
nomically nonsensical’ is no
overstatement. While dismant-
ling was fully under way Ger-
many was unable, by exporting,
to cover one-fifth of the costs
of importing enough to keep her
population and her industry
alive. Up-to-date machinery and
some of the finest factories in
the Ruhr were at the same time
being broken , up in order to
bring infinitesimally smaller
benefit to those countries who
had suffered from German
aggression. A bankrupt popula-
tion was forced to watch its
quickest means of livelihood
disappear under the hammers of
German dismantling crews. His-
tory will take note of such cases
as the ‘reparations’ factory
which produced ladies’ combs,
and the electrical plant in Ber-
lin, twice ‘reactivated,’ then
broken up at a time when one
Berliner in four was without em-
ployment,”
The correspondent further ob-
serves that those responsible for
the actual dismantling work are
today “as bitter and disillu-
sioned as the Germans them-
selves.”
A poor feature of it, noted by
other correspondents, is that it
is in the British section that the
dismantling has been going on ;
the Germans naturally make no
allowance for the fact that
Britain is merely carrying out
the policy agreed to in common
with all the other conquerors;
and thus the German hatred
aroused by the work is specially
directed against the British, and
by all reports it is deep and
bitter. As London “Financial
Times” comments: “What makes
the psychological effects of the
present policy even worse is that
dismantling at the moment is
proceeding only in the British
zone. The French and the
Americans have stopped, and it
appears to the Germans that
Britain’s action is determined
solely by a desire to destroy her
strongest European industrial
competitor,”
The Germans are encouraged
in that bitterly hostile view of
Britain by no less influential an
American publication than
“New York Times,” insisting
that the U.S. has been against
dismantling on the theory that
German industry is essential to
Western Europe’s recovery under
the Marshall Plan ; John J. Mc-
Cloy, American High Commis-
sioner in Germany, has called
dismantling “purposeless.” “On
the other hand,” the New York
paper declares, “Britain and
especially France favor dis-
mantling. They do not want to
encourage competition from
German manufactured goods or
to give Germany any opening
for rebuilding a war machine.”
“The truth,” retorts the
“Financial Times,” “is, of
course, that the British zone of
occupation happens to contain
the largest concentration of
German heavy industry, which
was the main target of the dis-
mantling programme as
originally conceived. But, it
admits, “no amount of explana-
tion will remove German sus-
picions of British motives.”
Balkan War Fears.
As a typical example of the-
greater alarm in the U.S. than
in Britain over war being pos-
sible, “Washington Post” sees
Yugoslavia as a really serious
danger-spot;
“For another time the Bal-
kans appear to be providing a
spark that may develop into
another and even more terrible
world-wide conflagration. For
it is very hard to see how, in the
present state of international
politics, such a conflict could be
localised The first act of
war, or even serious border in-
cident, would immediately be
followed by an appeal by the
Yugoslavs to the Security Coun-
cil of the United Nations.”
And there Russia could not
use the veto because it would
be a party to the dispute, so it’s
as good as certain the seven
votes necessary to a decision for
intervention would be avail-
able to the Western Powers;
and thus it would be a U.N.O.
war.
Ostracised Spain.
In the U.S. a steady flow of
criticism has all through opposed
the ostracising of Spain, the
main basis being the great value
Spain must be to the West in
the event of the Kremlin one
day following Hitler in aggres-
sion as it does in pretty well all
else.
In Britain, also, comment
favorable to Spain appears to
be growing; as an example,
London “Daily Express” on
suggested inclusion of Spain in
Marshall aid and the Atlantic
Pact;
“And, indeed, why not? Spain
would be a strong defensive
bastion in any clash with the
East. Britain should recognise
Franco; the gesture has been
too long delayed. We cannot
make friends with Italy and
other countries hostile to us in
the last war and refuse to .ac-
cept the overtures of Spain.”
The military-strategic value
of Spain is, however, not the
main line taken in British Press
comment. The main argument
springs from Britain’s trade
need, touched on by London
“Daily Telegraph”:
“How right were the British
Government to feel misgivings
about the withdrawal of Am-
bassadors from Madrid! How
foolish they were to withdraw
our Ambassador against their
better judgment! How strange
it seems to continue this treat-
ment of Spain when the cold
war with Communism is, so to
say, blazing, and when British
exporters, who have large in-
terests in the peninsula, have
been implored by our Govern-
ment to make themselves and
their goods popular in foreign
markets.”
The same trade argument is
advanced by a leading British
industrialist, Sir Alexander
Roger, also in London “Daily
Telegraph” (the particular piece
of absurdity that his opening re-
marks refer to happened when
Franco paid a visit to Portugal

and, because of the U.N.0.-
fathered diplomatic ostracism of
Spain, the British, French and
American Ambassadors had to
“find it convenient” to be absent
from Lisbon):
“As one in charge of a great
group of British industrial con-
cerns, all of which are taking
every possible step to export to
Spain, I can only characterise
this additional and painfully ob-
vious slight to Spain as the
height of hypocrisy and foolish-
ness when this country’s
[Britain’s] industries are being
urged and exhorted to export.
“Here we have a nation of 28
million on the flank of the de-
fence line of the Western nations
against Russia. That is a suffi-
ciently important fact to the life
of the United Kingdom. But in
view of the ecohomic crisis my
companies and many others of
equal importance are doing
business with Spain, and we are
moving heaven and earth to in-
crease it in what the Govern-
ment itself admits to be the
country’s interest.
“Spain is short of capital and
consumer goods. She has em-
barked on electrification on a
grand national scale. She wants
machinery and technique, and
she wants to develop her own
secondary industries. And it is
surprising how far along the
road she has already travelled.
“Does our Government want
us to seize the opportunity to
participate in this enormous de-
velopment or not? Several
European countries are substan-
tially exporting to Spain and ex-
tending long-term credit to
secure the business. Spain has
never defaulted in her inter-
national financial transactions.
“We commercial ambassadors
do not want political coddling
to help us to sell our goods, but
we do not want, either, to be
prejudiced by political blunders
in our own potential markets.
“Can we afford to alienate a
great country like Spain?
Should not we, if only in our
own selfish interest, help her to
develop her vast areas and her
industry? Should we not, with
our machinery and technique,
help her towards prosperity?”
Hitherto the answer to those
questions has been the senti-
mental-Leftish “No”; but the
forces now driving J. Bull hold
too grim a threat to allow the
missing of trade opportunities,
which, anyway, are being
grasped by member-States of
U.N.O. and other countries of
Western Europe and elsewhere.
Europe Needs Time.
On figures given to Congress
by U.S. Chief-of-Staff General
Bradley, Russia holds 175 divi-
sions under arms, and this num-
ber could be increased within a
few months to the staggering
total of 502, representing a
force of something like half as
much again as Germany, at the
height of its military effort, de-
ployed both in the field and in
the occupation of Europe during
the late war.
As well, the Soviet air
strength is put at some 16,000
planes of all types ; and to these
figures can, be added anything
up to 100 divisions available
from satellite States.
To set against that lot, says
London “Time and Tide,” the
Atlantic Pact nations count on
raising their present fantastically
meagre strength to about 50
well-equipped divisions in the
course of the next four years.
“This would represent a force
sufficient, perhaps, to hold a
bridgehead in Western Europe,
while American air - power
blasted Russia’s industrial
centres and a steady flow of
American divisions moved east-
wards across the Atlantic for
the third time in a century.
“It is not a very cheery out-
look, but it is better to know
how we stand. One fact which
transpires is that American aid
to Europe, and American stra-
tegic planning in general, must
be based upon the assumption
that there will be no war in the
next three or four years. For
aid to Europe is clearly a waste
of men, money and material
unless there is some hope that
a bridgehead on the Continent
can be held. And that seems not
even remotely practicable before
about 1953.”
Hurdles for J. Bull.
A report by the London
“Times” Washington correspon-
dent has pointed to what re-
main probably still the most
doubtful elements in Britain’s
recovery hopes.
One is in a quotation from
Detroit (U.S.A.) “News."
" DON’T UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF. JOHN!"
“Washington Post”: “The out-
look for labo# co-operation with
the Government [in Britain] is
far from encouraging.” In this
there has been some reported
improvement, but British as well
as U.S. sources doubt whether
there has yet been enough if a
most disastrous crash is to be
fended off.
The other uncertainty is at
the U.S. end of Britain’s ex-
ports drive: “If the past is
anything to go by, every Ameri-
can industry—with the support
of the unions involved in that
industry—which finds itself hurt,
or even feels itself in danger of
being hurt, will bring pressure
on its Congressmen and the
Senators from its State to raise
the tariff on its particular pro-
ducts.’’
This second danger is, how-
ever, not immediately pressing,
as the first is:
“For the next two years there
is no danger that the American
tariff policy will change, and for
that period anxiety here [U.S.]
will be concentrated, not on the
possible future stupidities of
United States manufacturers and
their political representatives,
but on the present attitude of
organised labor in Britain.”
Dragnet Digest.
Hobsorfs Choice on Germany
In the view of London “Spectator”
the Western occupiers have no choice
about the re-establishing of Ger-
many: “There is a natural hesitation
in French circles to see Western Ger-
many, with a larger population than
France, re-established too soon. But
there is grave danger that if a demo-
cratic Western Germany is not estab-
lished a nationalist Western Germany
will be.”
* * * *
Germany’s Chancellor. —In Ger-
many they say of Qf. Adenauer, who
was elected by a margin of one vote,
that he’ll be known as “The man
who elected himself Chancellor.” A
correspondent of N. Y. “Herald
Tribune,” lately visiting Germany,
reports him as ready to cement a
friendship with France, and gives this
thumbnail personal sketch: “Dr.
Adenauer is a man of consequence.
He is not a political hack nor a relic
of the past age nor, I believe, an
adventurer and demagogue. He has
a strong will, an imposing personal
authority, and exceptional experience
in German internal politics. He is
shrewd, and commonly known as
‘The Fox.’ ”
* * * *
Nuts I —A staff writer of London
“Financial Times,” on the . great
Socialist peanut fiasco (the British
Press roasting of which has already
been sampled here): “What extra-
ordinary people the British are!
Almost unanimously the Press has
deplored the performance of the nut-
ters. Yet hardly a single commen-
tator has failed to add that the
scheme must go on, albeit in modified
form. Is that so! What is so sacred
about Tanganyika nuts? Why pour
good money after bad (and all of it
coming out of your pockets and
mine)? It is all very well to preach
sermons on our duty to develop the
Colonies. Development is highly
desirable. But if the auditors’ figures
prove anything, it is that nuts are
not the things to spend money on in
Kongwa.”
* * * *
British Shipbuilding Threat.—Prac-
tically all sections of the British Press
see trouble looming ahead for British
shipbuilding. London “Daily Ex-
press” touches on one aspect of it:
“The world’s frantic demand for new
tonnage is easing. Competition in
shipbuilding becomes fierce. Warn-
ings are sounded from Belfast and
Birkenhead, Sunderland and Glasgow.
Britain’s costs are too high. Only
a month ago a £2,000,000 contract
from Portugal was lost to Belgium,
whose tender was at least £300,000
lower than the British.” Other papers
are certain there will be a slump in
the industry, with serious unemploy-
ment, which could spread.
* * * *
Giant Uncle Sam. —Figures quoted
by the “Milwaukee Journal” indicat-
ing some of the solid foundation of
Uncle Sam’s world stature: “The
United States, in the first quarter of
1949, was producing 33.6 per cent,
of the world’s lead, 35.4 per cent, of
the copper, 33.8 per cent, of the
cement, 43.3 per cent, of the zinc,
60.4 per cent, of the crude petroleum,
57.4 per cent, of the steel, 54.8 per
cent, of the pig-iron and 38.2 per
cent, of the coal. All of that, while
the United States has less than 7 per
cent, of the world’s population.”
* * * *
U.S. Atomic Progress. —Points from
the report to Congress of the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission:
Components of the improved Eni-
wetok-type bomb, tested last year,
are now being produced in quantity
“on an industrial basis.’’ Fissionable
material is being produced “in greater
quantities than ever before.” In
addition to uranium-bearing ores
from abroad “enormous tonnages of
very low-grade materials” have been
found in the U.S., presumably mak-
ing the U.S. self-sufficient in uranium
in case ,of war. New processing
methods will cut costs of uranium
and plutonium by from three-fifths
to two-thirds of present costs. As a
by-product of atomic fission new
medical treatments may be expected
for a number of diseases, from cancer
to goitre.
* * * *
Roosevelt Weakness. —Referring to
what he calls “the most inexplicable
phenomenon of Mr. Roosevelt’s
otherwise brilliant war record
that this master of domestic politics
failed to understand the immense
potentials of political warfare on the
international plane,” U.S. Admiral
Zacharias, in a “United Nations
World” article, comments: “It is
baffling why the man who invented
the ‘fireside chat’ to bring issues
before the people, and who was an
acknowledged master in timing the
announcement of policies to achieve
the maximum effect on public opinion,
should have been so myopic in apply-
ing these same techniques to political
warfare.”
* ♦ * #
Russia’s Helpful Agents.—Com-
mented on by “Yorkshire Post”:
“While thinking of Russian aggres-
sion we must never forget that in our
midst are Russian agents giving
themselves fanatically to the task of
undermining this country and other
countries of freedom. Was the mak-
ing of the Russian atom-bomb due
entirely to the independent research
of Soviet scientists or was it helped
forward by espionage and treachery?
He would be a very simple man who
thought that Russia gained nothing
from the disclosures by some of
those foolish scientists who were
trapped or bought or blackmailed
into giving information to Moscow.”
* * * *
If Tito Fell. —To such obvious
consequences as Russia getting back
on to the Adriatic and being able to
renew the “civil” war in Greece,
Julian Amery, in a “Time and Tide”
article, adds others—that “there will
no longer be any hope, short of a
world war, of any of the countries
now under Soviet control asserting
their independence,” and “the Com-
munist parties this side of the Iron
Curtain, and especially in Germany,
will receive a powerful encourage-
ment. It is not too much to say that
to allow the Russians to reoccupy
Yugoslavia would be as fatal an
error, both psychologically and
strategically, as that committed at
the time of Munich.”
* * * *
Thrifty Aberdeen. —It isn’t merely
an old stage joke at all; it’s fair
dinkuml There’s an actual organisa-
tion called the Scottish Savings Com-
mittee; its high priest (pardon—its
chairman) is Sir John Maxwell
Erskine; and its joy and pride is no
other than Aberdeen itself! “Open-
ing the annual conference of Savings
Workers in Aberdeen,” reports the
“Scotsman” (Edinburgh), Sir John
“pointed out that in a list of figures
submitted to the committee recently,
referring to savings in all cities in the
United Kingdom during the quarter
ended June, 1949, Aberdeen stood at
the top with the ‘magnificent figure’
of 15s. l{d. per head of population
per week.”
* * * ♦
Over-populated Britain. —As quoted
by N. Y. “Herald Tribune,” the
Population Reference Bureau, an
organisation established to study and
distribute population data, finds that
the British financial crisis is almost
certain to continue unless 15,000,000
persons leave Britain. The bureau
said Britain’s economy cannot health-
fully support them, and that if
Britain’s “surplus” population were
moved to Australia and Canada it
would help world peace and pros-
perity. This, the bureau added, is
in keeping with British policy.
* * * *
New Air Defences. —A London
“Observer” writer sees the “curious
quietness” with which Russia’s
atomic explosions were received in
the U.S. as perhaps explained by the
statement of a high American naval
staff officer that revolutionary de-
velopments in anti-aircraft design are
under way which may “in the not-
distant future” make the air space of
those countries which possess them
wholly of nearly invasion-proof.
“Apparently there has recently been
much progress in the development of
self-guided rocket-propelled missiles
which can seek out and destroy ap-
proaching aircraft or other objects
in flight, rising to unprecedented
heights at unprecedented speed.”
* * * *
The U.N.O. Flop. —As examined
by William Henry Chamberlin in
“Wall-street Journal”: “A list of
what the U.N. has failed to accom-
plish is more impressive than a list
of its achievements Its Charter
was framed on the highly-improbable
assumption that the coalition which
won the war would remain united
and that the only danger of future
aggression would lie in the resurgence
of the defeated Axis Powers,...
The U.N., like the League of
Nations, indicates that no organisa-
tion, however elaborate, can make
up for the lack of goodwill,' good
faith and common purposes among
the nations of the world.”

U.S. Television. —How television is
advancing in the U.S. at the expense
of ordinary radio is indicated by
figures published in “U.S. News and
World Report”: The output of
sound radios has dropped from
17.250.000 units in 1947 to a present
annual rate of 6,800,000. Output of
television sets, by contrast, rose from
866.000 in 1948 to an annual rate
of 2,000,000 last June. The publica-
tion quotes the prediction that
17,000,000 television home-receivers
will be in use by 1956.

Growing Germany. —The solid re-
covery being achieved in Western
Germany represented in a few figures
quoted by London “Economist”:
In 1947 German exports totalled only
$222 million; in 1948, they reached
nearly $6OO million, and during the
first six months of this year they
had already passed the total for 1948.
In 1947, Germany was paying for
only a third of its imports; it has
now doubled that proportion, in spite
of the fact that imports have risen
from $734 million in 1947 to $l4OO
million in 1948, and to over $lOOO
million in the first six months of this
year.

The Eem Wood
By DAVID
CAMPBELL

"TT WO Red Indians, fearsome in war-
S paint, skulked through the fowl-
j yard in the switch shade of young
elms. A third followed at some
distance, weeping, so that the tears made
runnels down the paint. This was
Minnehaha.
“Wait for me,” she wept, holding up
her pants with one fist and rubbing paint
in her eyes with the other.
The two leading Indians turned and
scowled for silence.
That was just like Babs. She cried if
she didn’t come; and then she came and
cried and spoilt everything. She was too
young for hunting.
“Shush!” Billy hushed, jabbing at the
distance with his bow. The convoy was
approaching.
Pout —pout —pout.
A turkey-gobbler fanned his tail like a
hand of cards, .and at each strut his
feathers puffed and fattened. His trem-
bling wing-quills trailed the ground. Here
was pride, green and crimson, out for a
walk under a jealous sun. His serpent-
hens preceded him.
“If we hit the gobbler,” Billy said,
“there’ll be an explosion.”
Janet tossed fair hair for silence.
The pageant of light-stepping birds
came abreast, and the two Indians
crouched low, their bows bent.
“Fire!” hissed Janet.
The arrows whispered through the
winter-sticks.
Oh, and it was good to see the gobbler
wilt and run as they leapt out from their
ambush! He was just a normal bird after
all. The children’s cries set the whole
fowl-yard in a flutter.
“Wait for' me!” cried Minnehaha.
But there was no waiting, for the long-
necked hens were coursing through the
gate, pacing for the open paddock. And
Billy ran, wild and fast behind, loosing his
arrows.
Ping! And a turkey fell.
The children scattered back among the
lean elms.
“Now you’ve done it,” Janet said. “It
was your arrow.”
“You were shooting, too.”
Billy was pale beneath his war-paint.
“But it was your arrow.”
“I wasn’t aiming at it,”. Billy said. He
was close to tears. “Where’s Babs?”
THEY crept through elm scrub, and
there in the green paddock was the
turkey-hen standing up, with an arrow
through, its neck. Babs was coaxing it,
her smock tucked up like a gleaner,
crying, “Chook, chook, chook! Nice
chook! ” while the hen thrust its neck in
and out wobbling the arrow.
“Babs! ” cried Billy in despair. “Come
away! Oh dear, everyone will be out in
a minute.”
“We could always eat it,” Janet said,
“Eat it!”
“Why not? I love turkey. We could
always chop off its head” . . .
“It’s certainly no use the way it is, with
an arrow sticking through its neck,” Billy
said, brightening. “And besides, someone
would be sure to see it.”
And as they crept out. of the elms,
stalking the turkey, Billy said, “It was a
good shot, wasn’t it, Jan?”
But the turkey, for a bird with an arrow
through its throat, was surprisingly alert.
They tried chook-chooking it like Babs,
and sneaking up behind it while Babs
chook-chooked. Each time it flapped
wildly up the paddock. And the children
were flushed and panting by the time they
had cornered it among the elms. There
the arrow caught in saplings. And Billy,
careless of the Roman beak in his anxiety
to be rid of the evidence, tipped up its
legs and tied them together with his
pocket - handkerchief. The legs were
scaled like a lizard, and a shutter clicked
shut, clicked open, over its bright little
eyes.
“Shush! ” Billy told it.
“I’ll go and get the axe,” said Janet.
UP the paddock on a strong roan mare,
a fat-mmped stepping mare; rode Mr,
Marshall, the overseer. A black kelpie
sheep-dog followed in his shadow.
The three children squatted low and
heard the snort and jingle as the mare
shied.
“Whoa, girl!”
Mr. Marshall slapped an arched neck,
tightening his knees under the roll of oil-
skin. The children could see red daylight
in the nostrils of the mare.
“Hallo! ” said Marshall. “Playing Red-
skins?”
Three meek Indians stood up screening
the bird.
“Just messing about,” said Billy.
“Come out of it. Coil! ”
But he was too late. The kelpie had
dropped his tail to the line of his back
and was treading with sharp-nosed
caution through the elm wood. The
turkey hen gobbled, stretching its neck
out along the ground. A black dog crept
and was snapped in the bright lens of its
eye.
“Ah!” said Marshall. He was a big
curly-headed half-humorous man who.
turned his horse easily with strong thighs.
“Scalping the turkeys, eh?”
He was at a loss whether to laugh or
frown.
“I only shot an arrow in the air,” Billy
said loudly.
“But we know you tell.”
Janet was at ballet school. She held
out one corner of her smock, delicately,
like a tea-cup; and she swayed, waiting
for the music,
“We know you’re all right.”
But no music came. Instead Marshall
was very serious.
“You’d better let me have a look at
that bird,” he said, tethering the cropping
mare.
Janet hung her head and bottom lip, and
became a small stained snivelling
“It was only a game,” she said. “A
game!”
Billy stood like stone.
“Right through the neck,” Marshall
hummed. He stood tall and uncertain in
the winter light, looking down at the
turkey. “Come out of that, Coil! ”
The dog slunk sly to the mare’s heels.
“Not a bad shot at all,” Marshall said
involuntarily.
AND he was committed. The children
had him firmly by either leg while
they chanted, “He won’t tell. He won’t
tell. He won’t tell. H<s won’t tell.”
“And you’d better not tell either, Babs,”
Janet threatened.
The little girl drooped into tears. And
Billy, wild with excitement, ran out in a
wide circle like a dog just let off its chain,
coming back to cry, “Right through the
neck!”
“But what are you going to do with it?”
said Marshall.
“Ah!” And the children became quiet
with mystery.
“You’d tell Miss Frost ” Janet said.
The two children shared a vision of
their governess. She hovered in the chill
air, middle-aged, sharp and grey; and as
she looked down at the trussed turkey a
blush of anger blotched her neck, mount-
ing inch by inch to burn on her high
cheekbones. The only rounded thing
about Miss Frost was her chest; and the
children believed that she kept a special
stock of color there that she could draw
on when annoyed.
Marshall stole a look between the-trees,
hoping for a glimpse of a very different
creature
“Oh, Miss Frost wouldn’t mind,” he
said. And, brightening, “I think she’d
think it quite a lark.”
The children were aghast.
“She’d kill us,” said Janet, simply and
with relish.
“You don’t know Miss Frost,” Billy
said.
Marshall smiled a far-away smile —the
glint of gold from some hidden seam —
and said, “Oh no? At any rate. I’ll keep
it under my hat.”
“Then,” said Janet, “we’re going to
chop off its head” . . .
“And eat it,” piped Billy.
“And we were wondering” Janet
said, looking up sideways. Marshall be-
gan to shake his head.
BUT within five minutes Babs had
been sent away crying and Billy held
the turkey’s legs behind his back while
Janet stood aside, fair and detached,
watching Marshall getting out his shears.
“Here!” Marshall said. “You’d be no
good in a branding-yard. Hold it over —
like that. Best put the poor thing out of
its misery!”
Snip!
With deep and horrified interest the
children watched the headless turkey
dance a dance of death.
“Why does it do that?” Janet asked.
Marshall had wiped his shears and was
safe in the saddle. He turned back.
“It might be just as well,” he said,
scratching the curly hair beneath his hat,
“if we say nothing about this. Keep it
dark.” And he dropped a lid and the
curl of his mouth.
“You can always get round him,” Janet
told Billy.
The black dog followed Mr. Marshall
over the hill.
“Stop it!”
The children had hidden the turkey
under a cream churn in the white-
washed, ivied dairy ; and now Billy was
chasing Babs through the mandarin-trees
with the turkey-head.
“Stop it!” Babs cried to the house.
“Billy! What are you doing?”
Miss Frost was standing full height on
the verandah.
Billy ducked from tree to tree and
buried the turkey-head beside the dead
robin in the vegetable garden. But he had
to go in for tea.
'"THE gas mantle glowed like a fairy’s
1 robe, like a buttercup, in the green
warmth of the nursery. There were
height-marks behind the door, showing
how much they had grown, and a possum-
stain on the tall ceiling that sometimes
looked like a fox and sometimes like a
racing car. Tonight it was a turkey.
“And whence, may I ask,” Miss Frost
was saying i “whence did the turkey-head
come? It’s a long while since Easter.”
Billy was lost in the ceiling. He had a
good idea.
He stood back from the gas bracket
and, tipping his fingers, made a silhouette
on the wall. Oh, a perfect turkey-head!
The turkey began to nibble at the colored
flowers of the wall-paper, to peck at a
bird of paradise. Janet and Babs spilled
their milk with laughter.
“Janet! You .thoughtless girl!”
Slopping up the milk, Miss Frost
seemed satisfied. But she looked up
sharply to catch Billy frowning at Babs.
“Is that all it was, Babs?”
The little girl was aware of her strength
and her weakness. An angel-smile lit up
her small round face. She tilted back the
glass, blowing bubbles in the milk and
kicking off her slippers under the table.
“Billy! If you’re lying” said Miss
Frost.
But Billy was ready for her.
“I didn’t say anything,” he said. “Even
if it was a turkey-head —which I’m not
saying—l didn’t say it wasn’t. So how
could I be lying?”
“That’s right,” nodded Janet. And
daringly—“where could he get one any-
way?” She smiled her sideways smile.
Color began to fill up the salt-cellar in
Miss Frost’s throat.
“Remember,” she said. “I was a little
girl once myself, and” . . .
The three children did not hear the rest.
They had put down their milk and were
staring at Miss Frost. It was the silliest
thing they had ever heard her say.
THE silence was broken by Mr.
Marshall putting his head around the
door.
“Ah!” he said. “Good evening, Miss
Frost, Children at tea?”
“Good evening, Mr. Marshall. Yes,
they’re having their tea.”
She was stroking Janet’s hair.
“Ah!” smiled Marshall.
Miss Frost smiled, too. And Miss
Frost had changed.
The children had noticed this before
when Mr. Marshall was about. She be-
came very light on her feet and didn’t
seem to know what to do with things.
Now, after wiping Babs’s face, the cloth
hung wet and dripping from her limp
hand; and it was as if she expected Mr.
Marshall to find some place to put it.
“Poor Mr. Marshall! ” she said, looking
at the cloth. “He’s been out all day going
round the, little woolly lambs. You must
be freezing,” she shivered, hugging thin
shoulders for the cold. “I’ve lit the bath-
heater, and turned your bath on.”
“Oh, good!” Marshall said. “That’s
good! Thank you—Miss Frost.”
The children wondered why Mr.
Marshall seemed so surprised, since Miss
Frost turned on his bath every evening;
and why he bumped into the door going
out.
And in spite of the nice things she said,
Billy thought that Miss Frost must be very
angry with Mr. Marshall, for her neck and
her cheeks were stained with powdered
crimson. „ ,
{Continued on next page.)


FOR three days the children tried to
forget that there was a turkey under
the cream-chum in the dairy. But each
time Len came out whistling over the soft
swept bricks, carrying a bucket in either
hand, they were there, hidden among the
ivy leaves, to study his face.
The ivy leaves fluttered and sparrows
flew out into the sunlight. Len blew a
silver tune through his missing tooth,
“Tonight,” Janet whispered, “we’ll have
the midnight supper.”
But it wasn’t as easy as all that. Some-
one—Janet said, echoing their mother—
someone had to do the work!
There was the store-room to rob for
raisins and sugared cherries and sweet-
crusted lemon-peel; and that meant
dreaming about the house until the house-
keeper left her keys on the flower-table.
There were those flat tins of sardines
among their father’s fishing gear: Billy
must sneak them ;he was the man. Then
the fire to light in the deserted cottage in
the elm wood. And, of course, the turkey
to cook.
Billy knew all about that. You
wrapped it up, feathers and all, in a
jacket of black mud from the creek (the
roots of the willow-trees made a pink mat
over the stone and flowed like drowned
hair down the cold waterfall); and copked
it in the coals in the open.
“All right.”
The fire was a brilliant window in the
grey dusk among the elms, and the
children were tarred with mud and
dragging their feet, when they met Mr.
Marshall coming down from the stables.
“It’s a bit blotched,” Janet said, “but
here’s your invitation to our midnight
supper.”
Marshall laughed and stopped laughing.
Wouldn’t they catch cold?
“Oh, it’s indoors,” Janet said. “In
Hetherington’s cottage. I didn’t quite
know how to spell that.”
“And there’ll be turkey,” Billy said.
“Packets of it!”
Mr. Marshall was not at all sure
whether he could come. He rather
thought he could not.
“But you won’t say anything to any-
one?” Janet said.
Marshall walked off to the bathroom
under the pepper-tree scratching his head.
WHAT did grown-ups do after dinner?
It was one of the mysteries.
From their sleep-out the children could
hear only the color of conversation. A
yellow square lit up the pot-plants far up
the verandah. Miss Frost laughed in
that special voice of hers and their
father’s voice echoed from the telephone.
A possum scurried from the wistaria and
across the whispering roof. Then
darkness and silence for hours . . .
“What’s the matter? What’s the
matter?”
Billy came struggling out of his dream.
They were cooking the turkey in the bath-
heater and had forgotten to turn the water
on. The copper-heater hissed and spat;
and when finally he got to the tap only
feathers came out the spout. A long face
looked back at him in horror from the
polished metal.
“Shush!” Janet whispered. “You’ll
wake up the whole house.”
“Leave me alone! ”
The bed was a warm wave flowing over
him.
“Shush!” hushed Janet. “And you a
boy! The midnight supper!”
“Oh! Oh!” Billy was out of bed. “I
wasn’t asleep. What’s the time? Ohoo,
it’s cold!”
If he could only clamber back into
warm sleep!
“Shush!” Janet hissed. “You’ve
woken them up.”
They waited in breathless cold. Their
father turned over and grunted, snored.
The wire door squealed under their hand.
And there ,was Babs behind them in the
star-dark, belting her dressing gown.
“Go back to bed,” Janet whispered.
“You’re too young.”
They knew what that catch and pause
meant.
“All right—all right! Come along!”
The three children crept over the loud
boards of the verandah.
Oh, the restless dark! Old Webb hooted
from the black pines of the cemetery.
There was a whimper among the acacias:
the little boy who had fallen down the
lavatory years ago. The pack on the hill
bayed, bayed and was still.
“Listen!”
The man in the cart that the house-
maids heard at night was listening, too.
When they moved, he moved: iron
wheels over the gravelled road.
“I’ve lost my slipper.”
And that was just like Babs. She came,
and spoilt everything. She hopped on
one foot while they hunted the furrows
of the orchard.
“Now the other one’s gone. Oh, my
foot’s cold! ”
~ Serve her right. The children
grumbled, comforted. They found the
slippers; and the fire outside the cottage
put out a friendly red hand to guide them.
They danced with shadows round the
crumbling coals.
“Now we can talk,” Janet said.
Her voice seemed cupped between the
elms.
“I’ll bet the turkey’s good. I’ll bet it’s
just right.”
Billy was raking away the coals. The
top half of the turkey had burned to ash ;
underneath it was raw.
“Never mind,” Janet said. “There’s a
bit here, between, that’s all right.
Um-m-m-m-m,” licking fatted fingers
with delight.
“I’ll carry it inside on the shovel,” Billy
said. “You go first.”
Babs and Janet screamed.
Miss Frost crouched still, among the
leaping shadows.
_ TT __,„ . . -. ..
T HERE were only two ways of looking
at it, Janet said. Either Miss Frost
was a witch—and she certainly had. be-
haved like one, chasing them up through
the trees in the blind dark with a stinging
switch of elm ; or . , .
It was soft morning. The children
squatted in the mushroom cave of the
maybush, looking at one another. A cat
curved like a long tongue past Billy s
ca x?/- ~ . , ~ „
“You wouldn t think he would,” Billy
said. He said to keep it dark.
Fui; ran through his hand like water,
“And he was in it just as much as we
were.”
The cat arched, rubbed. The slant
pupils of her green-gold eyes were shade
in the light of an unfocused torch.
“Perhaps” . . . Janet was looking at
the cat. “Perhaps we’re being spied on.”
“Go away, Tertius!”
Softly the cat sprang to the boughs of
the bush. A parrot fluttered and Tertius
shrank low.
“Let’s walk,” said Billy.
And kicking stones down the openltoad,
they decided what was to be done.
“If we go again, secretly, and she’s not
there, then it’s Mr. Marshall!”
Billy nodded.
It was a desperate plan, for there was
no telling whether a witch could read
your thoughts.
“Let’s put it off till there’s a moon?”
Billy said.
THE moon frosted the twigs of the
fruit-trees.
And beyond, you could imagine the
road winding with no one to travel it,
the creek stopped still, the paddocks
blank and milky, watched only by those
eyes that you saw from the car at night.
Anything might happen while the whole
world slept. And who would know?
The moon made a wicker cage of the elm
wood.
The two children caught their breath.
“There’s a light,” Janet said. “There’s
a fire burning in the cottage.”
Shadows crept through the darkening
wood.
“Let’s go back,” said Billy.
Huddled together, they went on.
“We’ll keep wide,” Janet said, “opposite
the window.”'
Flames leapt on the high walls. And
yet a window is a comforting sight. They
moved like foxes to the edge of the light,
and, tiptoe, peered in.
In the firelight, Miss Frost sat on Mr.
Marshall’s knee.
Back in the moonlit orchard, panting,
Janet began to giggle.
“What are you laughing at?” Billy
said. “That doesn’t prove anything,”
“He was kissing her,” Janet said.
“Don’t you see?”
“Well?”
“Oh, you’re too young.”
“I still think she’s a witch,” Billy said.
“And she’s got Mr. Marshall under her
spell.”
And looking up at the brilliant moon,
he half expected to see the governess and
the overseer slide by on a broom of elm.
KT EXT evening the children ran wild
f with a primitive kind of excitement.
There were two bathrooms: the real
one, tall, scrubbed, shadowy ; and the hot
round world reflected in the bath-heater,
where points of light glowed and plump
bronze children played like young gods.
Warm and flushed from the towel, they
ran to the nursery. And there, while the
fire threw up their shadows, they danced
their dance—undressed.
It was danced in dressing-gowns around
the table. Round and round they went,
Janet light and fair, Billy sturdy, and
Babs a tiny kicking colt. And when they
were puffed, giddy, they flung their
dressing-gowns wide and danced the final
measure with nothing on except their
flying capes. Fat young shadows danced
with them on the wall.
“What is the meaning of this?”
Crabbed age stood in the doorway.
The children tumbled giggling to the
couch.
“I won’t have it!” Miss Frost said,
her color rising. “You should be ashamed
of yourselves.”
But the children were not ashamed.
They giggled all the more, until Janet
brought a sudden silence on the room by
saying, “Miss Frost, why is Mr. Marshall
so funny these days? You know, kind
of not here?”
Miss Frost’s face was scarlet, but
surprisingly she smiled.
“Have you noticed it?” she said. And
archly, “Perhaps Mr. Marshall has been
hit by one of Cupid’s darts.”
“Who’s he?” said Billy.
“Oh, he’s a naughty little boy with a
bow and arrow who shoots people
through the heart and makes them fall in
love.”
“Wouldn’t it hurt?” Billy said.
Miss Frost giggled.
“Oh no, it doesn’t hurt. They like it.
And now, off to bed with you.”
Miss . Frost turned out the light, and a
bat started flitting around the orange-tree
with a sound like the snip, snip, of a
pair of scissors. Billy sat up on his elbow.
“I wonder, Jan,” he said, “if that little
boy could hit a turkey?”
“Well,” said Janet, “he got Mr.
Marshall in the neck! ”
And after they had been scolded for
laughing, she lay in bed and sobbed for
a long time before she went to sleep.
TERRA AUSTRALIS
Captain Quiros and Mr. William Lane,
Sailing some highway shunned by trading
traffic
Where in the world’s skull like a modHlit
brain
Flashing and crinkling rolls the vast
Pacific,
Approached each other zigzag, in con-
fusion.
Lane from the west, the Spaniard from
the east,
Their flickering canvas breaking the
horizon
That shuts the dead off in a wall of mist.
“Three hundred years since I set out from
Lima
And off Espiritu Santo lay down and
wept
Because no faith in men, no truth in
islands
And still unfound the shining continent
slept;
“And swore upon the Cross to come again
Though fever, thirst and mutiny stalked
the seas
And poison spiders spun their webs in
Spain,
And did return, and sailed three centuries,
“Staring to see the golden headlands wade
And saw no sun, no land, but this wide
circle
Where moonlight clots the waves with
coils of weed
And hangs like silver moss on sail and
tackle,
“Until I thought to trudge till time was
done
With all except my purpose run to waste ;
And now upon this ocean of the moon,
A shape, a shade, a ship, and from the
west!”
11.
“What ship ? ,J “The Royal Tar !” “And
whither bent ?”
“I seek the new Australia.” “I, too,
stranger;
Terra Australis, the great continent
That I have sought three centuries and
longer ;
“And westward still it lies, God knows
how far.
Like a great golden cloud, unknown, un-
touched,
Where men shall walk at last like spirits
of fire
No more by oppression chained, by sin
besmirched."
“Westward there lies a desert where the
crow
Feeds upon poor men’s hearts and picks
their eyes;
Eastward we flee from all that wrath and
woe
And Paraguay shall yet be Paradise.”
“Eastward,” said Quiros, as San Pedro
rolled.
High-pooped and round in the belly like
a barrel,
“Men tear each other’s entrails out for
gold ;
And even here I find that men will
quarrel.”
“If you are Captain Quiros you are dead.”
“The report has reached me; so is
William Lane.”
The dark ships rocked together in the
weed
And Quiros stroked the beard upon his
chin:
“We two have run this ocean through a
sieve
And though our death is scarce to be
believed
Seagulls and flying-fish were all it gave
And it may be we both have been de-
ceived.”
111.
“Alas, alas, I do remember now;
In Paradise I built a house of mud
And there were fools who could not milk
a cow
And idle men who would not though they
could.
“There were two hundred brothers sailed
this ocean
To build a New Australia in the east
And trifles of money caused the first
commotion
And one small cask of liquor caused the
last.
“Some had strange insects bite them,
some had lust ;
For wifeless men will turn to native
women,
Yet who could think a world would fall
in dust
And old age dream of smoke and blood
and cannon
“Because three men got drunk ?” “With
Indian blood
And Spanish hate that jungle reeked to
Heaven;
And yet I too came once, or thought /
did.
To Terra Australis, my dear western
haven, |
And broke my gallows up in scorn of
violence.
Gave land and honors, each man had his
wish.
Flew saints upon the rigging, played the
clarions:
Yet many there.were poisoned by a fish
“And more by doubt; and so deserted
Torres
And sailed, my seamen’s prisoner, back
to Spain.”.
There was a certain likeness in the stories
And Captain Quiros stared at William
Lane,
IV.
Then “Hoist the mainsail!” both the
voyagefs cried.
Recoiling each from each as from the
devil;
“How do we know that we are truly dead
Or that the tales we tell may not be fable ?
"Surely I only dreamed that one small
bottle
Could blow up New Australia like a
bomb ?
A mutinous pilot I forbore to throttle
From Terra Australis send me demented
home ?
“The devil throws me up this Captain
Quiros,
This William Lane, a phantom not yet
born.
This Captain Quiros dead three hundred
years.
To tempt me to disaster for his scorn —
"As if a blast of bony breath could wither
The frees and fountains shining in my
mind.
Some traveller’s tale, puffed out in moonlit
weather.
Divert me from the land that I must
find !
“Somewhere on earth that land of love
and faith
In Labor’s hands —the Virgin’s— must
exist.
And cannot lie behind, for there is death,
So where but in the west—but in the
east ?”
At that the sea of light began to dance
And plunged in sparkling brine each giddy
brain;
The wind from Heaven blew both ways
at once
And west went Captain Quiros, east went
Lane.

Description of the regent-bird?
It is one of the bower birds, and
sole member of its genus ( Sericulus
chrysocophalus ). The male is velvety
black, with head, neck and back, and
some of the wing-feathers, a rich
orange-yellow. The female is brown
above, with a whitish head and
underparts and black patches on the
head and throat. This species feeds
on insects, berries and fruits; its
call is a single whistle. The nest is a
slender construction usually placed in
a bunch of trailing creepers; the
eggs are yellowish, with blotches of
brown and grey and fine stripes and
scrawls of reddish-brown. The bower
is like that of the satin-bird, but
smaller and sometimes without any
platform of sticks. It is decorated
chiefly with berries, leaves and snail-
shells.

Is there any sale for Angora rabbit
wool in Victoria and names of Aus-
tralian firms interested in buying the
wool ?
There is no local market for
Angora rabbit wool in Victoria.
Some years ago a few people were
breeding Angora rabbits and obtain-
ing about 375. 6d. a lb. for the wool.
Baton and Ltd., Laun-
ceston (Tas.), may be interested in the
purchase of such wool. Incidentally,
the breeding and rearing of Angora
or any other breed of rabbits is
prohibited in Victoria except for
scientific and experimental purposes.

Nicolas Boileau’s M, I'Abbe des
Roches. They are:
There, take (says Justice), take ye each

We thrive at Westminster on fools like

Some particulars about the book
"Ben Hur” ?
Ben Hur was a best-selling his-
torical novel by Lew Wallace, an
American aulhor, and was published
in 1880. The hero is Judah Ben Hur,
heir of a rich Jewish family, by acci-
dent responsible for injury to the new
Roman governor by a falling tile.
His quondam friend Messala accuses
him of treason, and he is sent to the
galleys. It is years before he escapes.
In the course of the novel John the
Baptist and Jesus are introduced. The
most famous of the many adventure-
some episodes of the book is the
chariot race, in which Ben Hur
defeats his old friend and enemy
Messala. Ben Hur was dramatised
on stage and screen with great
success.

Origin and meaning of the Chinese
word “joss” ?
The name given to idols and
deities; it is not Chinese, but pidgin-
English of the Chinese seaports. It
is used adjectivally in regard to many
things connected with religious rites,
such as “joss-house,” a temple; “joss-
stick,” a stick which is burned as
incense; “joss-paper,” paper cut to
resemble money (and sometimes with
prayers written upon it) burned in
funeral and other ceremonies. “Joss”
is possibly a corruption of the Portu-
guese deos, god, applied by Portu-
guese navigators in the 16th century
to the idols worshipped in the East
Indies.

How is lamp-black obtained, and
what are its uses? "
It is a deep-black pigment con-
sisting of carbon in a very fine stale
of division, obtained by the imperfect
combustion of highly-carbonaceous
substances. It is manufactured from
scraps of resin, pitch refuse, inferior
oils and fats and other similar com-
bustibles rich .in carbon, the finest
lamp-black being procured by the
combustion of oils obtained in coal-
tar distillation. Lamp-black is ex-
tensively used in the manufacture of
printing ink, as a pigment for oil
painting and also for “ebonising”
cabinet work and in the waxing and
lacquering of leather. It is the prin-
cipal constituent of China ink.

Hints on (1) painting new plaster
walls and (2) waxing or staining a
wooden floor?
(1) First apply one or two coats,
the latter for preference, of a good
cement sealer, the purpose of which
is to seal in the plaster the live alkali
which is always present, and which,
if allowed to come in contact with
any oil paint later applied, would
cause peeling of the film within a
short period. When the plaster sur-
face is thoroughly sealed a good oil
paint may be applied with every
prospect of a satisfactory result. (2)
First see that any wax preparation
which may have been applied has
been removed. Unless it has been
removed the stain or other prepara-
tion will remain “tacky,” and be
quite unsatisfactory. Turpentine or
benzine will remove any original
coating. Should the wood be clean
and new no difficulty should be
experienced in applying either a
varnish stain or a flat oil stain, with
no preparatory requirement other than
freedom from dust. Probably two
or more coats of either stain will be
required, as the grain of the new
timber will absorb the first applica-
tions.

The STORK
JAMES HACKSTON
(USED to be
taken strange
drives in the
buggy: meaning-
less, purposeless,
fruitless jaunts (to
me) that were taken
while the stork
brought me (as I was
always informed
afterwards ) a new
baby brother o r
sister—a fact I could
never understand or
appreciate. I did not
want a new baby brother or sister. There
were things in my young life of much
more importance. Shanghai! Marbles!
Jews’-harp!
When Mrs. Mellup (the district’s mid-
wife) was in charge the driver went on
these tours (night-time—as it would
happen—when the passenger couldn’t see
anything worth while) to be out of her
way (as suggested by Mrs. Mellup) until
the anxious time was over and he was
allowed return to his own home again.
Being ignorant of the worrying signi-
ficance of these annual excursions, the
passenger could never understand why the
driver drove round and round the same
paddock opposite without a break or
variation, or why, each time they com-
pleted the circuit and drew level with their
own home (always on the other side of
the road from them —they never passed
nearer), the driver would pull up and
heave a heavy sigh, which sounded very
much like a deep sigh of guilt or remorse,
as if reproving himself or blaming himself
for something or other he had done ; the
more so when the night happened to be
frosty, or when a cold wind came cutting
down from behind the ranges.
Nor could the passenger understand
why the driver would stop and stare long-
ingly at his own house and not go in ; or
why the horse, also, should have to stand
and stare longingly at its own shed, its
head so completely turned round, with-
out moving its body, that you’d hardly
believe it could do it, and wonder at it.
And the passenger could never under-
stand, either, why the driver would not
address him in reply to his plaintive and
never-ending query as to when would
they be going home.
And then he would wonder why they
had to move on and do the same round
tour all over again, again look towards the
closed door and gaze more longingly than
ever at the little beacon of light that,
although near, always seemed to be get-
ting further away, his plaintive pleas
about going home still falling on deaf
ears, and the long, inquisitive-looking
nose of the horse again turned round at
the same almost unbelievable and in-
credible angle; but with a series of in-
quiring snuffles or snorts now blowing
down it.
AFTER several such annual tours, the
driver himself must have grown tired
of doing the same old trip. The next time
the stork came, the itinerary was suddenly
changed and the tourists drove up the
main road instead, and, having got to as
far as the store, the horse’s head was
turned round on the instant (this time
by the driver) and they drove back the
way they had come and, on drawing
level with their place, pulled up to the
same inquiring halt.
No sign coming from the stork, they
then set off at a most furious trot, with
fits and starts of galloping interspersed
between the fits and starts of trotting, the
horse’s tail and mane flying out like the
wind, where they were speeding to having
evidently developed into a matter of rare
urgency.
Then, after going a couple of miles, the
horse’s head was again turned round on
the instant and they drove back the way
they had come, but at a very slow pace
now, where they were going of no con-
sequence whatsoever, nor what time the
driver got there, either, and, after again
passing the house, set off at a most furious
.and reckless bat, getting to as far as the
store having suddenly become a matter
of life and death.
After this they slowed down again, the
reins slung loosely and carelessly over
the dashboard, the driver not giving a
damn whether the horse trotted, cantered,
ambled, walked, jibbed, galloped, bolted
or stood on its head.
But the next time Mrs. Mellup took
over there was no such tour, and my
meeting with her, officially, was my first
fight with a woman, and according to
precedent, I, as a male, lost.
MRS. MELLUP was broad of beam ;
thighs like a draught’s. Her fat
posterior moved rhythmically as she
walked. Her large bosom, which rose
and fell gustily, led the eye to
her thick neck, then up over the hill of
her chin and across the round, polished
reaches of her cheeks.
She had a perpetual-motion tongue that
seemed to run on ball-bearings. When
she talked, her words caused a draught
as they blew out, and people used to say
they caught a cold listening to her. Her
black hair was bunched at the back like
a Clydesdale stallion’s tail on show-day.
She used to drive about in an old gig,
and the gig almost seemed to groan and
gasp each time she got up into it. Look-
ing at her sitting in could feel that
it was on the very point of suddenly tip-
ping up, or back, and that Rainbow, her
horse, would, at the same moment, be
lifted up off the ground and hang help-
lessly in mid-air with Mrs. Mellup well
down at the other end of the scales. The
shafts always pulled skywards, with
Rainbow as if making a desperate bid to
keep his hold on the earth by setting his
hooves well apart: a splay-footed grip,
or stance, that evidently made him feel
surer of holding his ground.
I forget exactly how, or why, it came
about that, this time, I was left on the
premises when she came to our two-small-
rooms-and-lean-to-kitchen homestead ; but
I have a faint recollection that the silent
gentleman who had taken me on my
annual tours in the past was unavoidably
detained in Mittagong ; or was it Wollon-
gong? Or it may have been Wyalong,
Corryong, Jerilderie or Junee. I re-
member —
Father’s gone to Wollongong,
Mittagong and Wyalong
And Jerilderie,
Gulgong and Corryong;
And he’s at Junee —
but it doesn’t matter; I was home on this
particular occasion and, having been com-
manded by the stork to go and gather
wood, had just returned with my twenty-
sixth (or was it thirty-sixth?) armful of
sticks (an unheard-of number for any boy
—I thought—to gather at any one time)
when I was ordered to go into the bush
and “gather some wood.”
Gather some wood! *
I rebelled, and, seeking to get past her
to gain my mother’s private and always-
sympathetic ear, charged her in that
certain manner which, I had heard, had
been so ruthlessly and successfully
adopted by a certain clever wombat when
it wanted to get past our wire-netting and
gain the privacy of a garden we’d once
had.
But the Stork’s broad, round front was
firm and formidable, and the technique
that had been so successfully adopted by
the wombat, although quite a satisfactory
means of dealing with the stubbornness
of wire-netting, was, in this case, quite
the wrong form of attack, and I
bounced back the way I had come; and
it was while I was standing momentarily
nonplussed at not having gained my objec-
tive, but, at the same time, getting ready
to give the technique another go and
again hurl my head at the same obstacle,
that I was so Suddenly, completely and
hopelessly vanquished.
A DISH-CLOTH (wet), in the hands of
A an enemy, when thrown with pre-
cision and force, is much more effective
than, say, cowdung (properly seasoned)
or a handful of glutinous mud freshly
gathered from a dam. Mud, even slimy,
dank, greeny mud from an oozy quag-
mire, with all its rankness and offensive-
ness, still has something of earthy odor
and flavor about it. It is not absolutely
repugnant. But a sloppy dish-cloth, when
thrown, has (anyway, our dish-cloth had)
a mdst calamitous effect. Besides the
ignominy of it, it is a blow to a boy’s
prestige to be put out of action by means
of such an undignified and degrading
weapon. It lands with a clammy wallop
and hangs on the face (of course, when
used as a missile in combative action, it
must be aimed at the face) with the
pressure of a jellyfish and the feeling of
a stale poultice.
A boy stands incompetent and beaten
as the weapon clings, one end of it (the
fatty end, maybe) over one eye, or both
eyes, another end (the still-dripping-with-
dirty-washing-up-water end) pressing
sloppily and clammily on the forehead,
most of the face submerged, mouth sealed,
the nose fighting to draw breath, and, at
the same time, sorely discomfited by the
presence of a series of stale, dead kitchen-
odors that seep out of the weapon.
As I stood there (and it was here that
I first discovered I had been gifted with a
delicate and refined sense of smell) I
located the bacony washing-up water of
a previous week, and the smell of the liver
we’d had earlier; and there were quick,
brilliant flashbacks of smell to a certain
burnt stew we’d had, and a distinct re-
minder of one of the brave and original
soups our family invented from time to
time, with a whiff of soapsuds added —to
the smell, that is, not to the soup.
But, up to this point, I had only half
gone through with my undignified and
degrading defeat, for, after the implement
had made swift and sudden contact with
my face, it hung there longer than most
missiles take to hurt and harm; after
which, the clamminess began to move
slimily, stealthily and snakily and uncoil
itself; to squirm and wriggle free. This
done, it greasily, and disgustingly, slid
slowly over all my face, leaving behind it
a trail of cold, unhealthy dampness; then
wiped itself free and fell with a sickening,
soggy, squelchy, dead thud on to my
bare feet, where it coiled up and lay
damply.
Now the sound a dish-cloth makes
when it falls at the feet of its victim is
one that has a most depressing effect on
the spirit of the crestfallen victim. It is
the final staggering blow. The battle has
been lost. There is no comeback. The
shoulders droop. Chin seeks the breast.
Though brave the heart and stout the
spirit; though a victim, in the past, may
have had to stay back and write copies
of “Excelsior” until the possums began
to drop through the school roof, yet, for
all that, that soggy, slimy, squelchy, de-
cisive thud lowers the vitality, dwarfs
courage, stifles initiative and destroys the
true spirit of retaliation.
I could not even look up at the enemy.
MRS. MELLUP was the first woman
I ever hated ; and I discovered here,
also, that I possessed the spirit of hatred
and found it exciting. Although I loved
Mother, still, I’d
never got any great
excitement out of it.
Hating was ex-
hilarating, it gave me
a kick, and. helped
me to stand up
better against my
memory of the dish-
cloth debacle.
I set my shoulders.
Within the set of my
jaws, a rabbit-trap-
like pressure came.
When I looked at
myself in the piece
of looking-glass that
had most of the
silver off the back of it, I saw among the
bits and pieces of my features an eye
that was an eye: an eye that blazed and
was fired with the deep plots I developed
daily for the slow, long-suffering demise
of the enemy.
Then the woollen singlet came into the
picture, and I must also add that it was
here I first experienced the joy of power
—power over another person. I had the
drop on Mrs. Mellup.
She had been doing the washing, and
after she’d finished and hung out all the
clothes, discovered that she had forgotten
to wash my one woollen singlet. Being
lazy, and not wanting, as she’d finished, to
have the trouble of washing it, she took
the shortest cut and shoved it in the fire —
just as I happened to come on the scene.
I could hardly believe the evidence of
my own eyes, seeing the flames licking it
up, and her, standing with her back to
me, poking it further into the flames.
Then she turned round and saw me.
She stood and
looked at me.
I stood and looked
at her.
Power! (Also my
first.) I felt it be-
gin to grow and
kindle within me,
for, although upset
at seeing my singlet
go up in smoke, yet
the incident brought
me a rich, rising
satisfaction she
would be afraid I would tell Mother.
BEFORE you could say Jack Robinson
she went into the kitchen and, in
slap-up time, came out with a large, thick,
all-round-the-loaf slab of what looked
like just an ordinary piece of bread and
jam. She came insidiously towards me;
came slowly, slyly, coaxingly, her hand
stretched out, balancing the bread and
jam flatly on her open palm, and standing
before me like when we used to cut up
bits of meat into small pieces, place them
on the palm of our outstretched hand,
and stand motionless while our Harry, the
thrush, slowly, and always a little sus-
piciously, edged nearer and nearer to the
feast until he finally hopped on to our
hand.
“Bread and jam a-n-d butter! she
cooed.
I made no move.
“Bread and jam a-n-d butter,
b-u-t-t-e-r!” she coaxed.
I never budged.
“Don’t tell Mother, and you can have
another piece, too!” said the voice.
I turned my back on her and walked
away, leaving her still holding the piece
of bread and jam (and butter, too, don’t
forget—which was never done) on her
outstretched hand.
As I walked away I felt the terrible
urge to look back and see what she was
doing, but I kept my head and never
looked back. I can see her now, as I left
her that day, still standing there, holding
out the tempting bait.
T NEVER told Mother about the singlet.
1 Instead, I thought it best to hold the
sword of my knowledge over Mrs.
Mellup’s head, and, by Mother’s kindly
demeanor to her, Mrs. Mellup knew
that I had not, so far, informed on her;
but, at the same time, because of my
manner and cold refusal to eat the bread
and jam and b-u-t-t-e-r, the sword still
hung over her. I was keeping her in
suspense; keeping her surmising as to
when the weapon would fall. She left me
alone from then on, and the sword was
still hanging over her when she left our
place to take over somewhere else.
She had brought most of the local
children into the world, and sometimes,
along the road, she’d stop Tom, Bob, Bill,
or Jack, or Mary, Jean, or Jane and,
'dramatically, want to know when the old
man was going to square up what he still
owed her for bringing Jim, John, or
Nellie, or Betty into the world. But she
failed to recognise very bad debts. As
she had a lien, as it were, over certain
boys and girls, they would, when they saw
her coming along the road, make a hasty
retreat into the scrub and, parent-like,
dodge her. It is most humiliating to hear
that there is a balance still owing on one’s
entry into this world. I never dodged
her, though—not' that I’m insinuating
that we didn’t owe her a few bob here
and there.
But I bear Agatha Mellup no grudge,
for she taught me one good lesson in life.
Never have I, during the many great
quarrels I have had with women, pro-
ceeded with the quarrel in the kitchen, or
adjacent thereto. I have always seen fe>
it that the disturbance occurred in the
dining-room, or in the lounge. Never
have I forgotten that first vile and ignoble
defeat and, even now, as the sense of
smell carries one back to the past quicker
than sight or sound, I again smell the
seeping odor of bacony washing-up water,
the liver, the burnt stew, with a distinct
reminder of one of the brave and original
soups our family invented from time to
time.
To a Poet, Begetting.
You, w’ho piled and fired with mind’s heat
Your green loves, to unearth.
In corded logs of thought, your verse
For the world’s worth.
Forging in flesh, not words, have raised
A white flame from their char,
And love, that welded rhymes, now
moulds
A son in that star.

Shakspeare.
‘The Winter’s Tale” told these
summer nights at the Indepen-
dents’ North Sydney theatre
might well father a wish that this
game little body of Shakspearians
could boast the patronage of a
sufficiently pursy enthusiast to
drag them up out of the billow-
ing curtains and squeaking
pulleys-and-ropes they’re lost in
and set them up as they deserve.
Led by John Alden, who has
very much the right spirit of the
thing, they have ample talent
among them; at the least, they
provide a good night’s entertain-
ment. Even if it has to be said
that they’re as patchy as
Autolycus’ coat, the good parts
of the garment make up for the
rents; and, anyway, it’s a pic-
turesque garment.
Other reservations have to be
made; but in the main what
they really suffer from is their
mechanical appurtenances. They
are victims of their curtaining
conventions. Trapped and en-
gulfed in billows and ropes, they
look like Elizabethan buccaneers
reefing sail in a storm. Which,
in its way, is a form of praise;
at any rate it is Elizabethan
that they look.
Entangled thus, they suggest a
tangle of notions about the play-
ing of Shakspeare—above all
the prime need for simplicity*
and consequent speed. There is
the need, too, for simple clarity ;
but that is another matter:
psychological, not merely
mechanical. In the matter of
speed as a first essential, the
production strikingly points how
important in the superlative
Stratford-upon-Avon players’
recent “Much Ado About
Nothing” was the dispensing with
interrupting curtains; replaced
by the movable scene-pieces
which are shifted about to give
the changes of scene before the
audience’s eyes.
That has a double effect: pro-
vides a new and wonderful con-
tinuity, and incredibly cuts
down the time. Simply, it en-
sures speed; and it does so so
simply. May the example take
here for all future Shakspeare
presentation; and to the junk-
shops with all these confounded
curtains!
That mechanical brake on
speed had most to do with the
first-night “Winter’s Tale” last-
ing from about 8.15 to the stroke
of midnight; but some excess —
it might be called generosity—
in production did its retarding,
too. This excess, of course, can
be defended: there is really no
need for a sight of the bear who
eats the unfortunate old lord;
on the other hand, in this part
of the play we have moved into
a world of pastoral fantasy, and
such a bear as this is most cer-
tainly adds a touch of unreality.
In the same world, a pastoral
dance definitely interferes with
the total unity and the im-
mediately subsequent dramatic
effect and indefinitely prolongs
the time, yet it is so nicely done
that it would be a pity to have
it out.
So on with other excess of
production, including that ap-
parent inseparable from this
form of theatre, the over-
prominence of minor roles:
much in the minor key allowed
more emphasis than it merits;
overloading and so levelling
down, instead of showing off
and heightening, the total
dramatic effect.
Such impressions come from
the production as a whole; sub-
sequent to the early part in the
King of Sicilia’s court, where
Alden, in a fierce interpretation
of the king’s tragic jealousy,
completely dominates the others,
and you have very effective
Shakspeare. Very effectively
dressed Shakspeare, it should
also be said.
It may be that Alden’s note
is just a trifle too vehement.
It accords with his own pro-
ducer-comment in the pro-
gramme leaflet, that Leontes’
unreasoning, sudden type of
jealousy and its disastrous con-
sequences “is precisely what the
play is about.” In the plot it
leads to the apparent death of
the falsely-accused queen, the
death of their heir, the breaking
of the lifelong friendship be-
tween Leontes and the also
falsely-accused King of Bohemia,
and the banishing to the famed
wild coast of that coastless land
of the baby girl prematurely
delivered by the afflicted queen.
The play, of course, is about
something else besides: it is
about the very opposite —the
unifying force of love, sprung,
after the dramatically most
awkward lapse of 16 years,
between the now supposed
shepherdess (the banished Per-
dita) and Florizel, Prince of
Bohemia; all brought to unified
completion, with general recon-
ciliation, and even resurrection,
in the last act.
As the programme also notes,
it is a dramatic romance; with
the touch of fantasy Shakspeare
had mellowed to at that later
stage. Treated as such —as a
jealousy-variation upon a theme
of love—it can be an altogether
different, and indeed a much
lovelier, play.
The Alden view, however, is
nonetheless quite a fair reading
on which to base an interpreta-
tion, provided it can be con-
vincingly carried through. Apart
from the mechanical interfer-
ences, the Alden beginning—
very good, indeed, in itself —
renders that sort of unity doubt-
ful, if not impossible. The im-
pression taken was that Alden
believed thoroughly in the first
part of the play—the sundering-
jealousy motive—but didn’t be-
lieve a word of the end. On
the opening night—no doubt
there has been a sharpening-up
since—the end was rank melo-
drama. It has its own melo-
dramatic elements, admittedly;
but the impression was that the
melodramatic effect was very
largely the just harvest of the
required straining to live up to
a beginning necessarily over-
dramatised to accord with the
Alden view of the play, but too
severely serious for anything less
than stark tragedy.
Alden himself stands out: the
spirit and the vigor of the pro-
duction. He gets good support
from Alistair Roberts, Ronald
Van Berton, Leonard Thiele,
Edwin Finn, John Kernahan,
Paul McNaughton, June Col-
lins, Nancye Stewart, Joan
Boulken; though apart from the
Stewart one could wish for a
little more from the ladies of
the other prime essential —
clarity—and a little less of elo-
cutioning: the meaning’s the
thing, not the sound.
"Edward My Son."
Quizzed by a reporter as to
why he advocated State aid for
the theatre when his play taught
the lesson that money left to a
person never did anything but
harm, Robert Morley retorted
that that was a case of money
applied to an individual, not to
an institution, and added that
he had never known of a case
in which money left to a child
did him any good, though he
couldn’t help feeling that if
somebody had left him money
he would have spent it wisely.
All of which indicates that
Mr. Morley is a thoughtful per-
son. There are more indications
of the same sort in the play he
wrote and put on at the Comedy,
and there are indications that he
understood the character he was
depicting. Arnold Holt starts
off as a secondhand-dealer at
Brighton, England, and ends up
with a title and a high Govern-
ment position which his drunken
wife describes as “Minister for
Champagne.” In between he
wreaks havoc and destruction.
He has love for making money,
for which he excuses himself on
the ground that his six-year-old
son, to whom he is devoted,
needs a thousand poifinds for a
surgical operation, so he over-
insures his shop and fires it. By
a series of similar transactions,
some within the law and some
outside it, he acquires immense
wealth and great honor in a
world that believes in making
money as much as he does.
The son does not appear in
the play at all, but you know a
good deal about him. He is a
youth of great charm of man-
ner, like his father, spends the
old man’s money like water,
starts drinking like his mother,
gets a girl into trouble and
deserts her like his father, be-
comes an airman and dies the
death of a hero and is described
as a great leader, though, as his
mother acidly remarks, a leader
without a direction.
Morley drew a lot of laughter
from a full house at his opening
evening, but perhaps that’s what
he wanted. It is a serious and,
in fact, tragic and bitter play,
but Morley, who is a big, slum-
mocky giant of a man, played
it with a sort of easy insouci-
ance and ironic humor as if he
didn’t care a damn about it
really, but, although, in a sense,
his method was caricature, it
was remarkably effective.
Sophie Stewart was very good
as his wife. The battle between
her and her husband changes
her from a pleasant, happy,
secure wife into a middle-aged
maudlin drunkard, and Miss
Stewart left nothing out of the
picture. Ellis Irving, Lloyd
Lamble, Harvey Adams and
Bettina Welch made admirable
pawns in the contest.

There are 111 exhibits at Jos.
Holloway’s Sketch Club’s 11th
annual exhibition at 11 Parker-
street, Sydney, so perhaps 11 is
Jos. Holloway’s lucky number.
By a strange coincidence the
Bulletin's inspector ticked off
11 exhibits of some quality on
his catalogue. These are a
minor Lance Solomon land-
scape ; J. Salvana’s “Cow Pas-
tures,” brown with summer; a
tiny and delicate blue landscape
by Garrett Kingsley, from whom
more will be heard in this field;
a watercolor portrait of a
wharfie by G. B. Rees ; a small
landscape in. oils by Harry Pug-
mire which seems to show the
influence of Percy Lindsay;
Norman J. Forrester’s “Rain
Over Marley” and “Old Parra-
matta” with their bold skies;
some Chinese dolls by Jos.
Holloway; a watercolor by
Robert Tullock with a feeling
for the movement of waves;
Roy Thibou’s “Fisherman,” a
mile better than the imitation of
child-art submitted by the same
painter; and R. Hardacre’s
“Cargo Boat at Cairns.” As for
the remaining 100 paintings, the
Sketch Club hangs all-comers —
its members, its former mem-
bers, friendly outsiders and
waifs and strays —and, though
there may be a 12th man or
two, most of these would have
to battle very hard to get into
the Ist XI.

Leonard French, who has
been showing oils and mural
paintings at Tye’s Galleries,
Melbourne, some of huge
dimensions, is a recent product
of the George Bell school, which
teaches freedom of expression.
Everybody believes in freedom
of expression. The only diffi-
culty is to do it. Mr. French
appears to be ridden by a theory
like a sort of King Charles’s
head which crops up in most of
his pictures. The theory seems
to have something to do with
squares, and he applies it to
portraits, landscape and still-life.
Some of his heads look as if
they had been cut out of timber
with an adze, and his landscapes
with the broad axe. Still, he
often achieves a pleasing pat-
tern, and some of his murals
are oddly rich in color.

The obvious influence in
Arthur Boyd’s art, showing at
Kozminsky’s, Melbourne, is
Pieter Breughel—peasant Breug-
hel and Breughel the Droll, not
his son, “Hellfire” Breughel.
Boyd has explored his technique
and used tempera and glazes with
considerable skill to dramatise
the effects of light in a number
of large landscapes, one of the
best of which is the expansive
vista of “Point Lonsdale.”
Cows, horses and ploughmen
populate his landscapes, and in
“The Frightened Man,” a farmer
struggling with a horse on a
broken bridge in a stormy set-
ting, he has captured some of the
Fleming’s humor, “Eden” is
ail attempt in tempera to com-
bine in a single picture a lot of
human incident in the fore-
ground with the variety of bush,
sea and sky in the background of
that historic seaport, and it is
remarkably successful.

still composed of the same
crowd of musicians; and also
by the fact that Professor Heinze
became overnight Australia, s
first musical knight, though still
the same conductor.
Whether these momentous
changes have affected the play-
ing and the conducting is a moot
question, but it can be said that
this particular concert was well
up to the standard of its pre-
decessors. Sibelius’s Fifth Sym-
phony took its rugged course,
alternating vivacity with languor,
though there was a vagueness of
tone about the strings in the
second movement. De Falla’s
“Nights in the Gardens of
Spain,” with Lucy Seeker at the
piano, had a wilder note than
usual.
The whole programme was
uplifted when Dr. A. E. Floyd
took his place at the organ in
two Mozart sonatas and the
Organ Concerto, No, 5, in G
minor, of Handel. The veteran
adjudicator and broadcaster
made the huge instrument
dance, almost indecorously in
places, but nobody knows how
to get its sonorousness and
solemnity out of it better than
this superlative musician.
Musica Viva.
For its final Sydney concert
of the season the Musica Viva
Society gave, in addition to two .
Beethoven string quartets, the
Piano Quintet in A Major
(“The Trout”) by Schubert.
If ever a work demonstrated
in full measure Schubert’s
boundless genius for lyrical and
rhythmic beauty, combined with
exquisite form it is this. The
feat of composition becomes all
the more amazing when one
considers that he didn’t write
the work as an entire score but
as separate pieces for each in-
strument, including the unusual
double-bass, and he capped that
by playing impromptu the
piano part himself at the first
hearing.
Too often the rhythmic
phases of the work are given
with mechanical meticulousness.
Musica’s ensemble (Maureen
Jones, Robert Pikler, Richard
Goldner, Theo Salzman and
George Kraus) succeeded by in-
fusing some imagination into
their well-knit playing to keep
alive the spirit of carefree
joyousness inherent in it—and
to this they added a touch of
abandon. The result was delight-
ful.
Of the two Beethovens the
third of the “Rasoumovsky”
Quartets. Op. 59, in which the
two fiddles do so much unison
playing, brought out the best
playing. The F Major Quartet,
Op. 135, less easy to listen to
than the “Rasoumovsky,” mostly
gave evidence of careful prepara-
tion, though the tight discipline
of the first two movements was
relaxed when the lento assai
was reached this utterance,
deeply moving and of stately
beauty, was’ allowed to drag a
little at times.
N.S.W. Youth
Orchestra and Choir.
One of the usual features of
the activities of this organisa-
tion, which is under the baton
of Professor Carl Sauer, is the
skilful orchestration by the con-
ductor of classical pianoforte
pieces and songs. His pro-
gramme at Sydney Town Hall
included orchestrations of short
works by Chopin, Schubert,
Handel and Mozart, and in none
of them was the spirit of the
work of any debased by the
arrangement.
Generally the orchestra, many
of them quite young, played
with naturalness and no striving
after effect; a tighter degree of
integration, however, is called
for in the string section, particu-
larly among the lower members
of the viol tribe; the woodwind
voices could be strengthened
with profit, though Keith
Davies’s oboe playing had some-
thing to recommend it.
Shirley Bushell sang an aria
from Handel’s “Rinaldo” with
nice tone and good judgment.
June Stidwill’s singing of the
Mozart “Allelujah” would have
been more enjoyable could she
have conquered her habit of
exaggerated body-movement.
TALKIES
"Anna Lucasta."
Hollywood filmsmiths should
leave earthy stage plays where
they belong. . When producers
lift some wicked lady from the
boards and set her down again
in celluloid, and have to keep in
mind the Hays Office and such
bodies as the Australian Film
Censorship Board, the final result
is about as sinful as Grandma
on the gin. That probably ex-
plains how Paulette Goddard, as
Anna Lucasta, can hawk her
charms along the New York
waterfront, characteristically
wagging her tail, but giving very
little conviction to the part.
The information on how Anna
drifted into this game is not
necessary to the plot and would
have been better forgotten
altogether than presented as it
is, highly unlikely, and causing
loud laughter just when serious
furrows should be appearing on
the watcher’s brow. It seems
that one Saturday night after the
local dance the young and inno-
cent Anna had been planting a
kiss on the lad who had brought
her home when suddenly, in the
doorway of the shed which she
had chosen for these shenani-
gans, there appeared her heavy
father, heavy as lead, Oscar
Homolka. Under those circum-
stances most men with ageing
unmarried daughters might be
expected to retire discreetly and
throw up their hats. Not Oscar.
From this same little flashback
in the film one learns that he
immediately decided Anna was
destined for the streets, pointed
to the doorway and told her not
to darken it again. Off she had
gone, and down, down, she had
sunk.
The camera picks her up,
hardened and embittered, drink-
ing whisky with the bilge in a
place called “Noah’s Ark.” It
shows how the Lucasta family
manages to get her back again
with a view to marrying her to
the son of a rich friend, and
picking up the crumbs.
The Lucastas as a family seem
to be completely certifiable,
from Homolka, who says about
12 lines in the piece for all the
world like a cranky old bear
interrupted in his hibernation,
down to Broderick Crawford, the
most acceptable character of
any, who proves that his family
is tough by punching Oscar in
the midriff and despising cutlery
at the table.
"Slattery's Hurricane"
According to this 20th Cen-
tury Fox offering, sighted at
Sydney Plaza, the methods of
the U.S. Weather Bureau in
keeping tab of the hurricanes
which sweep in across the
Florida coast are not uninterest-
ing. As well as all the- usual
forecasting devices, the burpau
and U.S. Navy Air Force Work
together in sending out aircraft
which fly slap-bang into the
storm until they reach the centre
of it —an area of complete calm
known as the “eye.” The infor-
mation so obtained is, if the film
is correct, invaluable in plot-
ting the course of the storm,
etc., and getting out warnings to
districts in danger of being torn
up by the roots.
So much for that. The
authors of the film, however,
apparently intrigued by such
dramatic material, have given it
the woiks. Richard Widmark,
who first attracted some atten-
tion in films with his portrayal
of a killer with a particularly
irritating and insane laugh, now
turns up as an ex-Navy flier with
a chip the size of a Californian
redwood on his shoulder. It
appears that during the Pacific
war he peeled off from his for-
mation and sank, alone, a large
slab of the Jap Navy; unfor-
tunately his feat was not wit-
nessed, and the only recognition
he got for it was 10 days in the
boob or something for breaking
formation.
Very bitter about everything,
Mr. Widmark after the war be-
comes private pilot for a gang
of smugglers who conceal their
activities by posing as choco-
late-manufacturers. While so
engaged, and being very tough
to everyone, including the sec-
retary of the same organisation
(Veronica Lake), he meets up*
with an old Navy cobber now
engaged in flying into the eyes
of hurricanes and showing off a
rather slinky wife (Linda Dar-
nell). Linda and Mr. Widmark,
it transpires, have been old
friends, an association which
they keep to themselves, while
starting up again where they left
off a year or two before.
Having got that far the film-
smiths have nothing to do ex-
cept keep the cameras grinding
while the plot rolls along the
well-worn groove. Mr. Wid-
mark’s war-time heroism is sud-
denly recognised, and a suitable
gong is pinned to his chest; his
cobber wakes up to the funny
business with his wife; Miss
Lake faints her way into hos-
pital through worrying about
Mr. Widmark’s goings-on; so
Mr. Widmark fixes everything
by clipping his cobber —very
drunk —on the jaw and nobly
doing his job for him by flying
off into the nearest available
hurricane.
As this kind of fare goes the
film is f.a.q. melodrama. It is
told in the flashback method,
which is very satisfactory for
the Chinese and anyone else
who like their entertainment
slightly back-to-front.
“Conspirator” (M.-G.-M-, at
Sydney St. James): Robert
Taylor as smooth bit of work
in the form of an army officer
who sells staff information to
the Corns. He marries Eliza-
beth Taylor, who gradually
wakes-up to him, and is then
torn between loyalty to the
party, which doesn’t approve of
his wife, and loyalty to his wife,
who doesn’t approve of the
party. A bit overcooked. Sup-
porting film is “The Inlanders,”
an excellent documentary on the
Australian Inland Mission and
its sterling work, including a
good deal of arresting Centralian
scenery and a wonderful array
of Australian types and faces.
* * * *
“The Secret Garden”
(M.-G.-M., at Sydney Liberty):
Sugary little job with Margaret
O’Brien as the orphan from
India who goes to the great
gloomy castle of her uncle in
Yorkshire. Herbert Marshall is
the grim parent and Dean Stock-
well his particularly obnoxious
son. The O’Brien child, by find-
ing her way into the secret
garden which her uncle walled-
up 10 years earlier when his
wife was killed in there by a
falling tree, and by restoring it
to its original state of cultiva-
tion, teaches everyone how to
win friends and influence people.

Y \ h ere you are! Welcome —ha,

It was a bleak winter’s day,
with a wind that gave the thin high
mountain air an edge to it at once cut-
ting and hungry. A spiteful rain slanted
from the south-west and alternated with
a frozen sleet finer than smallest sago.
Only the nearer distances were visible
through the murk of it, and these loomed
out of it inexpressibly sorrowful, soaked,
and unnaturally large. There was need
for a welcome of the warmest kind to
Craigie Moor on such a day. But Mr.
Trimmer was there to give it to make
the hidden and sulky sun shine through
the gloom.
Mr. Trimmer was a short, stout man
whose shortness and stoutness interfered
not a whit with his physical and mental
alertness. He had a round fat face, and
over it the skin fitted with never a
wrinkle, and the skin was as rosy as the
apples for which Craigie Moor was
famous. A good face, comfortable and
comforting. A pair of dark eyes, a trifle
small, perhaps, for so large a face —with
its much-coveted schoolgirl complexion.
But good eyes, too, for all their closeness
to each other and their seeming to be so
firmly set, for there was a quick light of
understanding and sympathy in them.
In all, it was good to be welcomed by
Mr. Trimmer on such a day.
“You are, of course —now let me see,
let me see”
“Name, Pilgrim,”
“Yes, yes, of course, yes! Mr. Pilgrim.
You must excuse me, Mr. Pilgrim. So
many, Mr. Pilgrim. Busy time just now,
Mr. Pilgrim. But I remember perfectly
now, Mr. Pilgrim. Again, Mr. Pilgrim,
welcome, a hearty, hearty welcome to
Craigie Moor. That” —he benevolently
indicated a special flurry of sleet that
swept past the door —"that is not typical
of good old Craigie, you understand.
Merely a passing phase, a temporary
aberration, anything, what you will. But
not typical. Ha, ha, Mr. Pilgrim, you
are going to like Craigie—good old
Craigie! More than like it —you are
going to love it —just love it, Mr. Pilgrim.
You won’t be able to help yourself there,
Mr. Pilgrim! Now, however, let me see,
let me see —you are in that cottage in
McKell-street —new street that, Mr.
Pilgrim, brand-new and named after the
Governor-General. Old Craigie is up
to the minute, I can tell you, Mr. Pilgrim,
ha, ha! McKell-street —a good one that
is!”
MR. PILGRIM, a thin, tall, pinched,
withered, hopeless, helpless sort of
man, remembered with difficulty that it
way McKell-street. With a further quite
unnecessary racking of memory he re-
called that the cottage was named
“Cheddar.”
“Ah, Mr. Pilgrim. Mr. Pilgrim!
‘Cheddar’! That is a cottage, Mr.
Pilgrim. People talk glibly, Mr. Pilgrim,
of cottages, but there are cottages and
cottages. And ‘Cheddar’ is a cottage to
dream of. A dream come true. I can’t
help congratulating you, Mr. Pilgrim,
that you have ‘Cheddar.’ And let me see
now —business, business, Mr. Pilgrim!
Business is business, Mr. Pilgrim, ha, ha!
Mr. Pilgrim, but you have already paid—
let me see”
“One week,” Mr. Pilgrim croaked
dismally and guiltily. Then with some
new-found daring strength he mentioned
“in advance,” as though it were an ex-
tenuating circumstance.
“Good, good! Yes, to be sure, so you
did. You are staying, Mr. Pilgrim?”
“Three weeks, that is, if, it depends,
wife’s sister, she, if”
“Of course, of course, Mr. Pilgrim,
three weeks. I remember. Would you
care now, that is, while you are here
now, of course, would you care?”
Mr. Pilgrim looked pained, alarmed,
puzzled.
“As you wish, as you wish, Mr.
Pilgrim. Just thought you might find it
more convenient at the moment, you
know. But as you wish, fix it up later.”
Then Mr. Trimmer lapsed again into
the lyrical. “ ‘Cheddar’! ‘Cheddar’! That
is a cottage. A dream! All modern cons.
And then some. And in McKell-street!
Now for the key! Winnie!”
The girl at the desk looked up. Even
to the timid Pilgrim eyes she was a pretty
girl and with more schoolgirl com-
plexion than schoolgirls ever hope for.
That was just what Craigie Moor did for
complexions. No one could escape a
complexion like that in Craigie Moor.
“Yes, Mr. Trimmer!” Winnie, it
seemed, had been very busy entering
something or other in a big book.
“The ‘Cheddar’ key, Winnie!” The
very mention of “Cheddar,” however,
sent Mr. Trimmer into rhapsodies once
more. He rubbed his fat hands together
as one might do when Fortune’s wheel
has taken a turn in the right direction.
“ ‘Cheddar’! ‘Cheddar’! Ah, Mr. Pilgrim,
a dream come true!”
WINNIE took down from a baize
board a pair of keys attached to a
brass disk—about the size of a bread-
and-butter plate, Mr. Trimmer fondled
the keys and then twirled them round
and round. “Here, Mr. Pilgrim, are the
keys—of ‘Cheddar,’ Mr. Pilgrim,”
But Mr. Trimmer did not hand them
across. “There is, Mr. Pilgrim, ah, yes,
indeed” (as though such an untoward
thought had only just then entered his
mind) “there is, Mr. Pilgrim, a small de-
posit on the key.”
“How —how—much?”
“A pound,” said Mr. Trimmer with the
most pleasant and friendly firmness. “A
pound, Mr. Pilgrim. The usual thing.
An empty formality; But
the unwritten law of Craigie
Moor, Mr. Pilgrim, ha, ha!”
Mr. Pilgrim fished out
from a hidden pocket some-
where a wrinkled pouch of
black soft leather, the neck
and throat of which were
cunningly strangled by a
bright steel ring. From the
pouch Mr. Pilgrim abstracted
a folded pound-note. The
process was not lost on Mr.
Trimmer, one of whose
kindly and shrewd estimates
of mankind was based on
its division into the men who
carried money loose and the
men who had pouches and purses. The
difference between these classes, as Mr.
Trimmer well knew, was a profound one.
“There is, now that I think of it, ha,
ha, Mr. Pilgrim, that small matter of
charing fee. Perhaps, Mr. Pilgrim,
you’d like now”
The black pouch had already retired to
its mysterious hiding-place.
“How —how —much?”
“Only ten shillings—for a modern
compact place like ‘Cheddar.”
“Now —must I?”
“Oh no, oh dear no! When you
please, Mr. Pilgrim. When it suits you,
Mr, Pilgrim. The same goes for the
light.”
“The light!”
“Yes, the light, and power. Electric-
light and power, Mr. Pilgrim.”
“How—how?” .
“Cheap—cheap!” Mr. Trimmer
sounded like a small bird gladdened at
the first signs of spring. “A mere
nothing for a modern place like
‘Cheddar.’ Just wonderful, Mr. Pilgrim,
what the latest devices can do in the way
of cheapness. For what you get, I mean.
A mere song, as they say, ha, ha! You’d
hardly believe it, but for ‘Cheddar’ it is
only ten shillings a week.”
MR. PILGRIM swallowed hard in the
effort to believe it.
Mr. Trimmer noted the vertical move-
ment of the Pilgrim Adam’s apple, and
hastened to add, “When you please, Mr.
Pilgrim—when it suits you. And the
same applies to the garbage fee.”
“The—the—how—how ? ”
“Garbage fee, Mr. Pilgrim. Two
shillings a week. But, of course, not
necessarily in advance. When it suits
you, Mr. Pilgrim.”
“I —I —thought—I—l did think”
There was no need for Mr. Trimmer
to wait for completion of such sentences.
Long practice and experience led him to
anticipate the endings of all such
sentences.
“Oh, no, Mr. Pilgrim, the rent is not
comprehensive. Ha, ha! The seven
guineas is for the cottage and all its
amenities. Light, power, charing,
garbage, Mr. Pilgrim, are not part of the
cottage. Adventitious. Extraneous.
You understand, I’m sure, Mr. Pilgrim.
Ha, ha!
“And now, Mr. Pilgrim, if you are
ready. I’ll run you along to ‘Cheddar’
No, no, no, Mr. Pilgrim; it’s a pleasure
really. In any case, I have to go along
—few things I have to take to the
cottage. Above all things, Mr. Pilgrim,
I want to make you comfortable and
happy. And now for the family—where
are they? Oh, over at the station. And
your luggage—well, hardly room in the
car for that, but Jack King, the carrier,
can take that down for you. Jack’s over
in the railway-yard now. How many
children —Um! Five! Ah, well!”
Mr. Trimmer said “Ah, well!” in the
tolerant tones of one who viewed a big
mistake, but was ready, in the best tradi-
tions of Craigie Moor, to forgive it or at
least overlook it.
Still in a chatty way, Mr. Trimmer
said, “Young?”
“Young!” repeated Mr. Pilgrim.
“The children, Mr. Pilgrim. Ha, ha!”
“Oh! Yes! From six to fifteen.”
“Ah!”
Mr. Trimmer had a nice little blue car,
a most compact little car. He and Mr.
Pilgrim drove over the road to the
station. On the lee side of the building
was a group of children behind a moun-
tain of luggage. Mr. Trimmer diagnosed
the group as Pilgrims, and was much re-
lieved to note that the two obviously
youngest were girls. That fact, ap-
parently, had an important bearing on the
longevity of the “fittings” at “Cheddar.”
MRS. PILGRIM was a stout, pleasant-
looking woman —a great contrast
to the pained angularities of her husband.
At the moment she seemed to be playing
the part of peacemaker, with only
moderate success. She was ageing
visibly under the strain, although she was
assisted by the oldest —a disillusioned and
discontented-looking girl of fifteen. Her
voice could be heard above the Craigie
Moor blast. “Mother, do speak to those
boys!” Whatever the speaking was to
be done for, it was summed up in the
ample condemnation of “awful” and
“horrid.”
The two boys, twelve and ten; had
allied themselves in a secession movement
for the purpose of establishing a new
and separate State on the other side of
the station building, no doubt for the
better observation of the flurrying sago
snow. The two little girls—to all out-
ward appearance in still-life perfect
models of little girls—were now grizzling
at each other and at their mother, but
combined to resist the heavy hand of
tyranny exercised upon them by their
older sister. Also, they carried on as a
major part of their activities a warfare
with the boys.
“Ha!” said Mr, Trimmer. “Your
little family gathering, Mr. Pilgrim!”
Mr, Pilgrim pleaded guilty by an up-
lift of his bony shoulders.
“Nothing like it, Mr. Pilgrim. Get
the family away to the bracing air of the
mountains. Puts new life into them.
Ha, ha!”
With that wonderful innate delicacy
that so marks the very best of estate-
agents, who certainly see everything, but
remark only upon the pleasant, Mr.
Trimmer entirely ignored the tottering
confusion of the Pilgrim State on the
Craigie Moor platform.
As he pulled up alongside, Father was
recognised by the boys, who had sus-
pended all other operations to watch the
blue car.
“Here’s Dad!” they yelled together,
inviting the others to behold this
mysterious reappearance of Father in a
nice new blue car. The little girls ex-
citedly milled round the luggage moun-
tain and nearly fell off the platform.
Oldest girl shrieked ineffectively at the
boys—for “making shows of themselves”
in public, and at the little girls for the
danger they were running—but she con-
soled herself in the latter case—“Ah,
well, if they fall off and break their
necks, it won’t be my fault!” ending all
by an agonised appeal to the highest
authority in the land —“Oh, Mother, do
speak to those girls!” and “Do stop
those boys!”
“Are we going in that?” shouted the
boys. Mr. Pilgrim nodded gloomily. “I
bags front seat!” shouted Sid.
'T' AKING his cue from these recent
A developments, a figure detached it-
self from a motor truck and approached
through the sleet. It was clad in oilskins
and sou’wester, and proved to be
identical with that Jack King mentioned
previously. Jack was mostly nose and
beery benevolence. According to a re-
assuring aside from Mr. Trimmer, Jack
was “thoroughly reliable.”
When the luggage was at last on the
truck, and mother and oldest girl at last
agreed that there were nineteen pieces in
all, and the mound was covered with a
tarp. Jack mentioned in apologetic after-
thought to Mr. Pilgrim—“ And seven
shillings for that little lot.”
Mr. Pilgrim looked despairingly at the
beaming face of Mr. Trimmer and then
reproachfully at Mrs. Pilgrim, and
hopelessly at his numerous offspring.
Then said “Seven!”
Mr. King said nothing, but waited
patiently.
The oldest girl snapped, “Seven shil-
lings, Father! For the luggage.”
Thus stirred and prodded, Mr. Pilgrim
dived and came to the surface with the
black pouch.
“‘Cheddar,’ Jack!” said Mr. Trimmer.
“ ‘Cheddar’!”
“Yes, you know —in McKeM' street."
“McKell-street!”

Women's Letters
From Melbourne
Mrs. L. R. Buxton, who was committee
president of the Thank You, Britain ball,
hostessed a late-afternoon party at her
home and took the opportunity of thank-
ing everybody who had contributed to
the success of the function. Gold medal-
lions embroidered the hemline and yoke
of her black crepe frock. Her daughter
Beverley’s dove-grey tailored frock had
white cuffs and an inset white vestee.
Kathleen Lascelles, one of the hon.
organisers for the ball, offset her
beige frock with a large black hat swathed
in pink tulle. Her co-organiser,
Mrs. Hugh Syme, wore a black
tailored coat with an emerald-green straw
hat for contrast. A cheque for £5OO,
the proceeds from the ball, will help to
assist the plans for the proposed spholar-
ships which will be endowed by the British
Memorial Fund.
At the luncheon given by members of
the British Memorial Fund Sir Angus
Gillan, representative of the British
Council in Australia, explained in a
speech that was an admirable mixture of
wit and seriousness how Australians could
still further strengthen the bonds of
Empire by bringing into closer under-
standing all parts of the British Common-
wealth. The Chief Secretary and Mrs.
Leggatt were there. So were Mrs. Karl
Kumm, who will shortly leave for Can-
berra for a conference in connection with
the Y.W.C.A., Mrs. Essington Lewis, Mrs.
Rupert Downes, Mrs. Vasey—still in the
forefront of the battle for the rights of
widows of deceased servicemen—Mrs, L.
J. McConnan and Mrs. Frank Tait.
The makers of the Ecstasy creations
gave presswomen a preview of autumn
and winter fashions when mannequins
paraded in gowns which had been inspired
in the salons of French designers Piquet,
Desses, Path, Balmain and Griffe. Among
colors for dull, cold days are London
green, Hampton Court red, Sherwood
Forest green, donkey brown, Langdale-
mist (a soft blue), devil red and Clovelly
—the latter an amethyst shade. The
main trends are slim skirts, often with a
wrap-around . over-skirt, snug-fitting
sleeves, funnel necklines and the use of
buttons as a decorative finish. The newest
coats are slim-fitting at the waist, but
flare out below. The tent coat, still re-
taining its popularity, has unusual back
treatment. In a donkey-brown wool
crepe frock the pockets of the skirt are
set at a slant, with the back of the bodice
in the form of a simulated bolero finished
with large buttons.
Many frocks featured the new
“scissors” panels. On a model of tobacco-
brown crepe scissors panels crossed over
the front of the skirt and turned under
at the hem. It also had a tulip collar
and button finish. The highwayman
collar is still, the mode ; on one coat a
collar of this type was detachable. One
smart black coat had a triple collar of
black faille lined with gold faille. On
another black coat Peschaniki fur
fashioned a “funnel” collar. The short
evening dress, which can be used also for
cocktails and dining-out, has an appeal
for women on a limited budget. Emerald-
green moire made one wrap-around skirt
which was allied to a strapless bodice of
black velvet; with it went a little black
velvet jacket. A bolero of cinnamon-
brown crepe matched a draped skirt
topped with a strapless bodice of white
Swiss guipure lace. The uneven hemline
pops up in every collection, and in this
it was seen on a very full-skirted model
of white moire taffeta. The always-
striking combination of black and white
was used with elegance in Magnolia, a
gown which featured a strapless top of
petals made of magnolia-tinted satin and
teamed with a slim black moss-crepe skirt,
which had an overskirt draped diagonally
across the front.
Guests came from various parts of Vic-
toria and Queensland for the marriage of
Elizabeth Hampton, only child of Mr.
and Mrs. T. Merry, of Alvechurch,
Worcestershire, England, and Henry
James, younger son of Mr. and Mrs. H.
Massey, of Toowong, Queensland.
Groupings of Christmas-lilies and white
gladioli decorated St. John’s, Toorak.
Elizabeth was given away by her uncle,
Harley Styles. The bride’s tailored
gown was of off-white faille, long-
sleeved and with the bodice finished
with a tulip collar. Her lace veil
was caught with a pearl headdress, and
she carried a bouquet of off-white orchids.
From a pearl-studded Juliet cap fell a
waist-length veil of white tulle. Her
bouquet was a posy of white gardenias
and stephanotis set in a tulle holder. The
only attendant was the bride’s cousin,
Mrs. Alan Hurley, who wore a bouffant
gown of off-white moire, which had a
bertha collar of white lace. Bill Taylor,
of Queensland, was best man.
Bowls of white gladioli and Christmas-
lilies were set around the banquet-hall at
Menzies’, where Mr. and Mrs. Harley
Styles welcomed many guests for the re-
ception. Mrs. Styles wore a black-and-
gold-spotted faille frock with a large
osprey-covered black hat. Mrs, Massey,
mother of the ’groom, chose an all-grey
ensemble. Mrs. Bill Taylor’s large red
stra<w hat was worn with a red-and-white-
patterned silk frock. Mrs. John Kibby,
an old school-friend of the bride, added
a matching hat to her natural linen suit.
Mrs. Charles Butler’s suitings were in
horizon-blue angora. Diana Learmonth
and Pam Stevenson plumped for the navy
outfit. Mrs. Bill Day’s powder-blue frock
was worn with a large natural straw hat.
Mrs. H. Bamfield contrasted her dusty-
pink linen suit with a small black rose-
trimmed hat. Lorna Bamfield, her sister-
in-law, was in aqua-blue linen, white
straw hat and white accessories. Lady
Linton’s frock was floral-patterned, her
large hat of black straw. Mrs. James
Mclntyre’s cyclamen-and-beige-spotted
silk frock was worn with a cyclamen
coat; her hat was of natural straw. Mrs.
Len Buxton wore blue-and-grey-floral-
patterned silks.
The Lady Mayoress, Mrs. J. S. Disney,
gave a welcome-home party to Lady
Beaurepaire, who wore with her black
ensemble a black hat adorned with white
flowers. The hostess added to her junior-
navy crepe frock, the skirt of which had
the new apron front, a small white straw
hat trimmed with blue-and-white taffeta.
Floating panels were a feature of
Lady Wales’s navy frock. Mrs. Oliver
J. Nilsen’s blue-feather-mounted grey nat
was worn with a powder-blue jacket-suit.
Mrs. W, Brens was. smart in black crepe.
Madame Martin Wang’s national costume
was of grey-and-white-spotted silk,
finished at neck and sleeves with narrow
white silk braid. Mrs. A. G. Warner
wore a navy faille coat over a white
frock.
For the past 12 months Mrs. Stanley
Smith has been honorary organiser for
the Association of the Aged and Infirm
Blind, duties which entail travel all over
the State, forming auxiliaries, of which
she now has eight in action. There is a
small home in Bendigo, one at Brighton
and another at Windsor for these aged
blind people, and land has now been
bought at Ballarat as a site for another.
Mrs. Smith has an office at 10 Queen-
street, where donations will be gratefully
received. Photo by John Warlow.
To thank all those who had helped her
make the Garden Fair, held at the home
of Sir Owen and Lady Dixon for the
funds of the English-Speaking Union the
big success it was, the convenor, Mrs.
Gerald Bacon, gave a tea-party at her
own home. Following an American
custom Mrs. Bacon had three of her
friends serve tea; they were Mesdames
Alwyn Spicer, Leslie M. Perrott and
Dorothy Propsting. Mrs. Bacon’s after-
noon frock was of black faille. Lady
Dixon had slate-blue satin ribbon as
trimming for the black hat she wore with
her black wool-crepe ensemble. Mrs.
S. J. Fletcher was in navy and matching
hat. Mrs. Harold Bettle’s small grey hat
had feather-trimming; her tailored suit
was also grey. Mrs. F. W. Fraser, who
heads the Canadian women, had grey
Persian-lamb lapels on her grey suit and
feather-trimming on her wide-brimmed
grey hat. Lady Lowe’s white hat had
black ostrich-feather mounts. Royal-blue
was Mrs. Aubrey Gibson’s frock, the
same shade of ribbon trimming her small
white hat.
From Sydney
The cicadas were all tuned up for the
investiture at Government House last
week. The day was hot and still, and the
locusts gave of their best. The air was
vibrant throughout the ceremony with
practically an orchestral accompaniment.
The Governor, Lieut.-General John
Northcott, pinned on decorations —about
100 of them —with neatness and dispatch,
and his own kindly brand of smile.
Besides the recipients there were proud
mothers, and wives, sisters and brothers
and a few bored babies. Not only brave
men but brave women were decorated.
A group of nice-looking girls received
the Associate Royal Red Cross for de-
votion to duty. Former senior Com-
mandant of Maoriland V.As., Margaret
King, received the M.B.E. for war service
in Italy. Mrs. D; A. Hudson received the
Imperial Service Medal for long service
at the G.P.0., Southport, England, during
the blitz. What pictures of the war years,
of indomitable England, of Malaya, New
Guinea, the Middle East, were called
as these smiling, alert, and now serene-'
looking women received the insignia of
courage! For once the glory was not to
the glamor girl, nor the clever girl, nor
the smartly-dressed girl. It was to a
nation’s heroines.
The charmful subject of this Norton
Trevaire photograph is Mrs. Adrian
Quist, wife of Australia’s famous tennis-
player. At present, while her husband
is away defending his titles and
questing fresh honors, Mrs. Quist is at her
Palm Beach home with her two children.
f Mrs. Quist’s mother, Mrs. A. W.
Keighley, of Clifton Gardens, is happily
preparing for a visit home from her son
Geoffrey—his first to Australia in 11
years. There’s to be a fourth-dimension
cocktail-party to welcome him home just
before Christmas. All his old school fel-
lows of Tudor House days will be pre-
sent. Since leaving Australia Geoffrey has
been to Eton and Oxford, with three
years in the R.A.F. tucked in between.
At Oxford he rowed for his house and
got his cricket blue. He has played for
Oxford against Australia. He is studying
law at Lincoln’s Inn, in the Middle
Temple, and flies to Australia the day
after he sits for his final exam, as a
barrister.
At the White City there was Christmas
in the air on a still hot night last week at
the final of the radio-party drive for
Food-for-Babies Fund. ChristmaS-bush
glowed, balloons hobbled and holly made
a darkly-green background when Mrs. lan
Jacoby and Mrs. Ken Pointing, the
hostesses of the night and president and
secretary respectively of the movement,
welcomed about 200 guests. First there
were cocktails, then there were saunter-
ings and chat, then came the buffet-
dinner, then dancing, then supper and
still more dancing. During the evening
the prizewinners in the drive were an-
nounced by 2UW, and the announcements
were relayed to the White City by
Standard Telephones. This caused great
excitement, as at any moment one of the
drive hostesses might become the owner
of a lawnmower, a chaffcutting machine,
a refrigerator or some such gadget.
Star turn of the night was Mrs. lan
Jacoby’s informal singing of “Vienna,
City of My Dreams.” She stood in the
middle of the room or walked quietly
about as she sang, giving a truly reflective
character to the music. Her shirred black
taffeta evening frock with its strapless
bodice and its soft scarf of chiffon were
admired. So were Mrs. Ken Pointing’s
moth-grey chiffons, the ankle-length skirt
made in ballerina style. All the principals
from “Oklahoma!” came on after the
show. The party served as a farewell to
Mrs. Jacoby, who, with her husband, goes
flying to U.S. after Christmas, and to
Shirley Gray, president of the Junior
Group, who goes off in the Orcades,
object a ski-ing holiday in Switzerland.
Altogether the drive has raised over £2OOO.
The Lunchtime Music Club, which
meant so much to music-lovers during the
war, paid tribute to one of its founders,
the late Sydney de Vries, last week. Mr.
de Vries and Margaret Gillespie launched
the club, and for eight years it continued
its Monday concerts. Last June Mr. de
Vries died, and the club decided to dis-
band. The founding of a scholarship for
singing was a fitting memorial to Sydney
de Vries. A cheque for £l6OO was pre-
sented for this purpose by Margaret
Gillespie to the deputy-director of the
Con., Mr. N, L. Salmon, at an early-after-
noon concert in the rooms of the Empire
Society. The Brahms Sonata in F major
for ’cello and piano was played by Scilla
and John Kennedy. Una Gibson’s harp
was heard in works by Debussy and York
Bowen, and Raymond Beatty sang songs
by Schubert and Brahms. Gwyn Aldis,
who played accompaniments, also handed
Margaret two posies of flowers from
committee members present. Admiral and
Mrs. Feakes, Mrs. Henty, Mrs. B. Muscio,
Gladys Marks, Dr. Edgar Bainton, the
Roland Fosters, Colonel and Mrs. Alan
Foott were among the 70 or so paying
tribute to an old friend.
The A.J.C. and Tattersall’s Club popped
a lovely gift into the Red Cross
Christmas stocking. It was a cheque for
£22,000, the proceeds from the September
10 race-meeting at Randwick. Keith
Mackay, who had been president of the
race committee, presented the cheque to
the deputy-chairman of the Red Cross
G. A. Patterson in the A.J.C. rooms.
Mr. Patterson then did his act. He pre-
sented Red Cross life-membership medals
to Keith Mackay, A. J. Potter, A. Dawson,
G. Rowe and S. E. Chatterton, members
of the race-meeting committee.
In front of the drill-hall at Victoria
Barracks in last Friday’s twilight the Air
Force band played dashing music, and
on the right-hand side of the hall a mobile
canteen was busy preparing the “hots” —
the patties and the fish —for the United
Service party which got off punctually at
half-past five. Indoors, Air-Vice-Marshal
McCauley and Mrs. McCauley turned on
bright smiles and handshakes for all. The
Governor, Lieut.-General Northcott, and
Elizabeth Northcott came early ; so did
Lieut.-General Berryman and Mrs. Berry-
man. They were being asked to pass on
congratulations to daughter Ann on her
just-announced engagement to Bill Wills,
of South Australia. Bill’s father and the
General were young comrades-in-arms.
Keith Morris and Mrs. Morris were
the centre of a big group. She has just
been made Divisional Commissioner of
Girl Guides for Brisbane Waters, and
there were congratulations for her, too.
Psychiatrist Dr. McGeorge talked of
Shakspeare as a psychologist while
his wife smiled beneath. a black
scuttle hat with a white quill decor. In
this group were Colonel Paddy Moore
and Mrs. Moore and Mrs. Pulver. Across
the way with the official party were
Colonel Spain and his daughter, Mrs.
Russell, cool and attractive in black-and-
white-patterned silks. Major Joyce
Snelling, who, with Margaret Stephen, had
arranged about two tons of Christmas-
bells and -bush so that the hall looked
like an Australian Christmas carol, was
a persistent dancer. Mrs. Sidney
Herring was there with her General. All
these and hundreds more, pots of foam-
jng beer on the floor so that you had to
step delicately, a roar of human voice, an
orchestra playing “My One and Only
Highland Fling” were, by eight o’clock,
notching up Success.
Guests at Mrs. Perkins’s Christmas-
party at the R.S.Y.S. came from Turra-
murra, from Bowral, from Manly and
from beyond Rose Bay. This is a yearly
frivol starting with cool mint-juleps,
going on to bridge or chatter and ending
up with a tea-party in the grand manner —
the finale of which is the cutting of a
Christmas-cake inches thick with almond
icing.
Atmosphere is a curious thing. “The
Enchanted Tree,” now running a late-
afternoon season at the Royal, introduces
the audience to gum-trees, a sundowner,
a billy boiling, a rabbit ballet and
“Waltzing Matilda,” all within the first
quarter of an hour or so, and yet it re-
mains a little alien. Still, this play for
children has charm, and delightful ballets.
Trust producer Heather Cell for that. The
show opened at five-fifteen one evening
last week to a house crowded with young
schoolgirls, a few parents, and dozens of
tiny ones. These last rested, squatting on
the floor of the dress-circle foyer before
they were ushered into the theatre. It
must have heartened Harald Bowden to
see this youthful crop of future theatre
audiences. The play will be repeated
tomorrow and Friday afternoons. Five

THE SERVICE MAN
Russia's New
Cold-war Staff.
“Ek Dum”; The latest move
in the cold war against the
Western Nations is the forma-
tion in Peking of a liaison
bureau, by which the Communist
parties will direct their opera-
tions for handing over Pacific
Ocean countries to the Soviet
system.
The idea is not new. It is the
second attempt of the kind, the
first having been the formation
of the Eastern Bureau of the
Comintern in November, 1922,
at a Moscow conference at
which the Australian representa-
tives were Earsman, Garden and
Payne—the first two members of
the Eastern Bureau. This bureau
organised the Pan-Pacific Trade-
union Secretariat, with China as
a base.
China did not prove a very
secure H.Q., however, since the
Communist movement there
failed to flower immediately and
the Chinese developed an un-
pleasant habit of cutting off
heads of members of its secre-
tariat.
Eventually, under direct orders
from the Comintern, H.Q. were
established in Australia. The
Communist party here in 1926
was ordered to treat the
organisation of a Pan-Pacific
conference in Australia as an
urgent matter. Garden and J.
Ryan (Labor Research Bureau)
became the organisers and pub-
lished reports on their activities
to induce other countries to send
representatives. But the Com-
monwealth Government stepped
in and refused to allow a con-
ference attended by half the
murderers and revolutionaries in
the Pacific to assemble on Aus-
tralian soil.
Eventually Moscow sent out
a certain Comrade Rubanoff,
who held a convention in Syd-
ney, most of those attending
being prominent officials of the
Labor movement. The A.C.T.U.
took the matter of the
P.P.T.U.S. up under the guid-
ance of Messrs. E. J. Holloway
and Garden,
Then a conference was called
in Vladivostok. Australia sent
three representatives, F, Roels,
a member of the A.L.P. Execu-
tive and afterwards a Lang-
appointed Legislative Council-
lor (N.S.W.), P. G. Hannett, and
F. Walsh, of 'South Australia.
Almost everybody else present
was a world-ranking Com-
munist, including Losovsky,
from Moscow. Earl Browder,
head of the American Com-
munist party at that time, was
general secretary.
The conference adopted every-
thing it was told to adopt by
Losovsky, including plans for
the repudiation of arbitration
and the destruction of industrial
peace in the Commonwealth.
A monthly journal was pub-
lished in Australia (“Pan-Pacific
Worker”) under the editorship
of J. S. Garden. The Comin-
tern followed the holding of the
conference by the issue of
further instructions to the Com-
munist party in Australia in a
letter dated October 13, 1929:
The party must conscientiously
join in the important work of the
Pan-Pacific Trade Union Secretariat,
which is an important factor in the
crystallisation of a Left wing on a
national scale.
“Pravda” declared a little
later:
The Pan-Pacific Trade Union Sec-
retariat has made great strides to-
wards destroying Australian workers’
prejudices against the colored races
and colored labor. The difficulties
are still great, but the secretariat has
already managed, to a considerable
extent, to divert the sharp edge of
the Labor movement in Australia
from the color question and to direct
it against its own white class-enemies.
It must be remembered that
at the time this was written the
P.P.T.U.S. in Australia was not
mainly the baby of the Com-
munist party. Its high-priest was
Garden, principal organiser of
the Lang-Beasley party.
Developments later put the
scheme out of court, since it
needed a Communist Govern-
ment somewhere in the East as
a host and a pliant Labor Gov-
ernment in office at Canberra
instead of the Lyons Govern-
ment.
It was revived so soon as the
Communist insurgents of Mao
were in the saddle and had com-
pleted their alliances, announced
their defence and foreign-affairs
unity with Soviet Russia.
Then a conference of the
Communist-run World Federa-
tion of Trade-unions was called
in Peking. It is not without in-
terest that this step was taken
after visits by Messrs. R. Dixon,
general head of the Australian
Communist party, and Comrade
Thornton to conferences behind
the Iron Curtain in Europe.
Comrade Elliott V. Elliott, of
the Central Committee of the
Communist party, left Australia
ostensibly to attend this con-
ference, but his movements in
China were mysterious. He has
declined since his return to make
a statement.
Peking Radio has been more
explicit. It said last weekend
that a 21-point programme had
been agreed upon for the opera-
tion of a new Eastern Bureau—
the Comintern list of conditions
precedent to membership ac-
cepted by the Australian Com-
munist party in 1922 also con-
sisted of 21 points.
The Peking announcement
stated that in the bureau Aus-
tralia would hold the fourth per-
manent seat. The bureau would
operate under the leadership of
the great Soviet Union “to take
from the necks of colonial coun-
tries in the Pacific and East
Asian area the yoke of colonial
enslavement.” It is to organise
the call to give all “patriots”—
otherwise rebels —engaged in the
task of “liberation” all possible
help. The formation of the
liaison bureau was justified be-
cause, “inspired by the vic-
torious struggles within China,
the national liberation move-
ment will develop further in
other countries.”
The Soviet Russian repre-
sentative at the conference an-
nounced the plan of the bureau’s
work. It is to be left to the
Soviet Union, “as the leader of
world Communism,” to pro-
claim its formal existence.
Generally speaking, the whole
scheme is resurrection of the
Comintern’s Eastern Bureau and
the P.P.T.U.S., and is in essence a
warlike measure against the
British Commonwealth and its
component parts and all non-
Communist Governments on this
side of Suez.
It all adds to more justifica-
tion for the banning of the
Communist party as a body act-
ing under the impetus and direc-
tion of hostile foreign Powers.
The bureau is nothing more
or less than a Russian-bloc
special staff formed for opera-
tions from within against this
country and its allies.
Chiang's Retreat.
“Ek Dum”: The Chinese
Nationalist Government has not
remained long at its “new”
“capital at Chengtu. Within a
few days of establishing it, it
was preparing to move its mili-
tary h.q. once more to Sichang,
further west. For all intents and
purposes, however, the Nation-
alists have been driven out of
mainland China and the Gov-
ernment itself will move to
Taipeh, in Formosa.
When that has gone nothing
will remain in China to oppose
the Communists save the so-
called “Kwang-si Army,” but it
is not clear whether it supports
Chiang Kai-shek. Probably it
will support the winner, if the
winner will pay.
The Nationalists have an-
nounced that they are ready to
defend Formosa “to the last
ditch.” But they also were
prepared at one stage to defend
Nanking, Shanghai and Chung-
king, beside a few other places,
in the same desperate manner.
“Ditch” seems to be a good
word for the normal position of
Chiang and his followers. He
resembles, in his career, the kind
of Australian “Labor” politician

who started as a Communist and
who has followed every change
and twist of public opinion with
a change and twist of his own,
at the same time growing to
personal prosperity on the way.
Formosa is not a country
likely to ooze enthusiasm at the
thought of being turned into a
battleground. In fact, the smell
of rebellion is in the air there,
generated partly by local patriot-
ism and partly, no doubt, by a
knowledge of the “democratic”
habits of Chiang and his war-
lords.
If the United States decides,
as it appears likely to decide,
despite earlier views to the con-
trary, that Formosa is not essen-
tial to the strategic defence of
Western interests in the Pacific,
the end of Chiang is in sight.
Meanwhile, the position is
quiet on the Hong Kong front,
where the Communists have dis-
covered the advantages of an
adjacent stable market. They
have opened the frontier by
agreement, but the crisis with
them has yet to come.
The Western Defence
Plan.
“Ek Dum”: The basic pattern
of Western European defence
now is virtually complete after
nearly two years of organisation.
Its structure is based on the
Brussels Treaty of March, 1948,
as the result of which the
Foreign Ministers’ council was
created as a supreme authority.
To implement the terms of the
treaty, which called upon the
original nations to render all
military and other help in their
power to any contracting party
attacked, various other bodies
were constituted.
The first of these is the per-
manent commission, seated in
London, consisting of the diplo-
matic representatives of four
Powers in London, plus a British
representative of ambassadorial
status. This is the regular ad-
ministrative body. Below
or rather parallel to it, is the
Western Union defence com-
mittee, under which are the
chiefs-of-staff committee and the
Western Union military supply
board. The C.O.S. committee
consists of the chiefs-of-staff of
each of the nations concerned,
land, sea and air. A permanent
military commission serves this
body in the same way as the
permanent commission serves the
Foreign Ministers’ committee.
The practical side of the
combat organisation is the com-
mander -in - chiefs’ committee.
This, like all the other arrange-
ments, is a makeshift designed to
assuage national pride, which it
is inevitable would have to be
assuaged. The chairman is Field-
Marshal Montgomery. The other
members are General De Lattre
de Tassigny (France), Com-
mander-in-chief Land Forces;
Air - Chief - Marshal Robb,
C.-in-C. Air Forces, and Admiral
Jaujard, Flag-Officer Western
European Naval Forces. This is
the actual committee responsible
for the battle-plans of defence.
The members have no executive
commands at present, but in the
event of attack would at once
slip each in his particular field.
The defence scheme is over-all,
and takes no account of home
defence, except that territorial as
well as tactical air forces would
fall under the charge of the
C.-in-C. Air, as F.-M. Mont-
gomery explained in a lecture to
the Royal United Service Insti-
tution recently.
The naval position also is
somewhat nebulous. The flag-
officer would not be a C.-in-C.
in the normal sense in time of
war, except in so far as special
forces and tasks were allotted
him in Western European waters.
“Any more dumpers and they'll be disappearing altogether!
Obviously the strategic concep-
tion of naval defence would have
to be considered as world-wide,
especially in view of modern
submarine developments.
The chiefs-of-staff committee
approves terms of reference on
which all military problems con-
nected with Western European
defence are studied. It is also the
body which places all business
before the C.-in-C. committee,
and is responsible for giving
effect to C.-in-C. committee de-
cisions.
There is an American liaison
organisation at Fontainebleau,
mostly for advisory purposes,
and other U.S. bodies in London
working with the armament and
supply committees. The
Canadian C.O.Ss. also are repre-
sented in appropriate fields at a
useful level.
There is an uneasy feeling that
it is not all going on oiled wheels,
which has been intensified by
Field - Marshal Montgomery’s
own remarks. While he
emphasised that from the start
there had been absolute agree-
men! as fo the fundamental
strategic conception of Western
European defence, he finds
“grave disadvantages in the com-
mittee system of management.”
The military custom, he said,
was for a question to be
examined in all its aspects, and
then for the commander to give
his decision on it. In contrast to
this direct approach, the corn-
mittee system was “complex,
cumbersome and slow.”
However, it seems that the
system cannot be cured in peace-
time-better let history repeat
itself than national pride be
affronted. In war-time the
appointment of a supreme com-
mander is inevitable.
An essential to the success of
the scheme, according to Lord
Montgomery, is the need for the
whole organisation to become
international, and for every
servant of the scheme to con-
sider himself an international
employee—“nations could not
get effective co-operation with-
out some small sacrifice of
sovereignty, and if every nation
was to continue to strive for self-
sufficiency in defence, what value
would it get from the Western
Union?”
It is quite clear that a lot of
streamlining will have to be done
before the new plan is efficient,
more particularly as the business
of the organisation is carried out
in two languages—French and
English.
Despite the assurances of Mr,
Chifley that the danger of war
yearly recedes this is not the
belief in Europe, and war prob-
lems there grow every day with
the growth of war material.
This is largely due to the mass
organisation of armies in Eastern
Germany and immediately be-
hind the Iron Curtain elsewhere,
the turning of Albania into a
Russian-controlled base and the
establishment of high-ranking
Russian military officers in com-
mands which can be designed
for only one purpose.
The whole problem is compli-
cated by the position of Western
Germany and its demand to be
allowed to defend itself.
This will have to be answered
very shortly whether the Western
Allies like it or not. Otherwise
the world may find the Western
German State driven to closer
relations with its other half in
sheer self-protection.


“Yes, yes—that new street past the
Scout hall —turn off near the dead pine-
tree.”
“O.K. O.K, I know now. But for a
minute you give me quite a turn, Mr.
Trimmer. I know now.'*
With the skill of the born tactician,
Mr. Trimmer disposed of the boys
“Here you, Sid and Arthur” —he seemed
instinctively to know their names —“You
.young shavers can go with Jack and keep
him company.”
Sid and Arthur, nothing loath, dived
into the cab of the truck, and there
quarrelled bitterly over the indignity of
“sitting in the middle.” Jack somehow
settled the dispute satisfactorily—being
the first person who ever did so. Beer,
benevolence and the pure Craigie Moor
air all assisting, no doubt.
“And that’s that; ha, ha! That’s
that! ” said Mr. Trimmer. “And now for
the rest of us!” He
eyed the huge form of
Mrs. Trimmer and com-
muned a moment with
himself as to where it
was best to put it. “I
think. Mother, if you get
in front with Alice, and
you, Joan, with little
Nellie and Dad at the
back —how does that suit,
now? But wait a minute
—just a minute —a few
things on that back seat
I’m taking along to ‘Ched-
dar.’ You wouldn’t mind
—would you now —hold-
ing these things? They
are the only things still
needed to make ‘Ched-
dar’ absolutely complete.
Here you are. Mother!”
And Mrs. Pilgrim had a
dozen egg-cups deposited
on her lap. “Here you are, Joan!” And
two white glass lamp-reflectors went on
to Joan’s lap. “And you. Dad —ha, ha.
Dad, what do you think of these?”
These were a length of cotton rope and
a much-gapped tomahawk. Mr. Pilgrim
eyed them with a noticeable degree of
suspicious satisfaction,
r3E car engine came to life. But
fresh trouble developed on the back
seat. It commenced with whispering.
“Sh!” commanded Joan.
“But I can’t wait,” came the anxious
voice of Nellie,
“You’ll have to. Anyway, why didn’t
you go while we were waiting for hours
on that awful platform?”
Nellie began to whimper to indicate
distress and extremity.
“Do speak to Nellie, Father, and make
her behave.” There was little sympathy
in Joan for the frailties of juvenile nature.
“Would you mind?” asked Mrs.
Pilgrim, and Mr. Trimmer stopped the
car. Mrs. Pilgrim, having been fitted
into the narrows of the front seat, could
not extricate herself without much time
and difficulty, so Joan led off the
distressed Nellie in a most jerky and
disdainful fashion —back to the platform.
Mr. Trimmer noticed nothing and
chatted amiably. “See that!” he said.
“Weather breaking—soon be fine —as it
always is in old Craigie.”
Everyone looked for the “break,” but
only one gifted with Craigie Moor
weather wisdom could know where to
look for it.
Joan and Nellie returned, Nellie being
jerked along by the other arm.
“Now, we are off, ha, ha! ” And the car
whizzed along the broad highway. The
mist and sleet and sago certainly were
diminishing, so there must have been a
break somewhere.
After a mile or two of smooth going
along the modern speedway, Mr. Trimmer
swung into a road to the left.
“Ah McKell-street! ” said Mrs.
Pilgrim with relief —the distance was
beginning to worry her.
“Not yet, not quite, but nearly there
now. Best of this part is the privacy.
Wonderful privacy,”
As the road dimmed and thinned
among the trees there certainly did seem
to be lots of privacy about. Mr.
Trimmer swung into a road to the right—
a rutty sort of road that slowed up the
speed.
“Ah!” said Mrs. Pilgrim.
“No —not this —the next one,” said
Mr. Trimmer with a soothing sort of
chuckle that motherly hens employ with
their chickens. He cautiously nosed the
car into a narrow break of mountain
scrub and undergrowth, “And here we
are—McKell-street —the coming street
of Craigie Moor —private and full of
yiews.”
He said “views” as though they were
a kind of bait for cunning and reluctant
fish. “Views —wait till this weather
lifts properly—and then Ha, ha!”
NOSEY BOB.
McKell-street alternated in bare rock,
stretches of land and awe-inspiring holes
and ruts. On all sides the scrub closed
in—“Trees, privacy, views,”*crooned Mr.
Trimmer to himself.
Like a voice from the tomb came the
words “Five minutes!” from the back
seat. It was Mr. Pilgrim talking to him-
self. Again, Mr. Trimmer understood.
“It depends, of course; you’d hardly ex-
pect Mother here to walk to the station
in five minutes, but I guess these
youngsters would do it. It all depends,
you see, ha, ha!” Mr. Pilgrim wrestled
with those five minutes —and conjured up
a vision of some early settler covering
the distance in five minutes, and in only
just five minutes—what time he was
closely pressed by a pack of dingoes.
AND then, quite suddenly really, the
car stopped at a neat rectangular
aperture cut in the scrub.
“ ‘Cheddar’!” said Mr.
Trimmer with becoming
reverence.
The wind was howling,
but the sleet and sago
had almost ceased; the
torn banners of cloud
still drifted by, on the
ground and through the
trees, now dense and im-
penetrable, now light
and in trailing wisps,
like smoke that has for-
gotten how to rise. Mr.
Pilgrim looked at the'
trees. The trees drooped
mournfully and looked
like fowls when they
stand round on one leg
on a wet day with no
shelter to go to. Some
of the countless trees
were black of butt and
grey of foliage, and here and there were
others white of butt; and these in this
uncertain light looked like ghosts or
tombstones. The low drift of clouds, the
sodden trees and the awful regularity of
that rectangular hole in the scrub all
weighed heavily upon Mr. Pilgrim. He
groaned.
Mr. Pilgrim was staring at the rect-
angular hole, set in the middle of which
was that cottage called “Cheddar.”
“That! ” said Mr. Pilgrim.
Mr. Trimmer understood. He had been
too long in Craigie Moor and had taken
too many pilgrims to innumerable
“Cheddars” not to realise what was now
passing through Mr. Pilgrim’s mind. If
such an incongruous term as purring can
be applied to such a robust specimen of
humanity as Mr. Trimmer, then did that
good man purr:
“Look at it I ” he addressed Mrs.
Pilgrim. “Look at it! That’s com-
pactness for you. And it’s all there.
Everything. And you simply can’t find
housework to do in a place like that.
Simply can’t—even if you wanted to.
Ha, ha!”
Mr. King’s truck was standing in front
of the mansion ; at least it was parked on
a comparatively level patch of sand and
rock by one of the short sides of the
rectangle. Evidently Mr. King had
stopped at that point, for McKell-street
also stopped there. There was nothing
about the house itself that would postu-
late this as the front; though certainly
there was a gate in the paling fence.
Nor did there seem any other way of
approaching “Cheddar” through the
scrub. Mr. King came towards the car,
in his black garments looking like a
monk in some very strict and enclosed
order, but for the fact that his large nose
shone like a doctor’s lamp. As he
approached, some uncertainty was
evidently upon him. In silent interroga-
tion he jerked a thumb over his shoulder
towards the rectangle. And Mr.
Trimmer gave a barely perceptible nod.
And Mr. King pursed his thick lips as if
to whistle, didn’t, and ejaculated instead
—“Well, I’ll be jiggered!”
Mr. Trimmer became all bustle,
brightness and cheerfulness. He opened
the doors of the little car, and said
“Come along now” to Alice and Nellie,
who sprang out with agility. “Now, you.
Mother —first let me take the egg-cups.
That’s good. Joan, you wouldn’t mind
bringing the lampshades, I’m sure. And
you, Father, the axe and the rope,”
Mr. Pilgrim stood where a footpath
would have been if such a thing had
been thought of when McKell-street was
pushed into the scrub. There Mr. Pilgrim
stood, with a coil of rope in one hand
and the gapped tomahawk in the other—
the dejected figure of an executioner,
giving, however, his client the kindly
choice of two means of sudden exit.
MR. TRIMMER called to Jack, who
was still pondering his doubts as to
the identity of this place. There was no
name up anywhere, for “Cheddar” was
like one of those silent numbers that do
not appear in the telephone book:
“Bring it in. Jack!” Mr. Trimmer called,
and with his array of egg-cups he
hastened to the door, and unlocked it
with one of the keys on the brass bread-
and-butter plate. Mrs. Pilgrim followed
hard on his heels. The door led into a
glassed-in verandah, neat, narrow, com-
pact and furnished with Venetian blinds.
Already the somewhat reassured Mr.
King was piling up the luggage and gear
on to this verandah, snowing under in
the process a day - bed and spring
mattress, and a comfy chair, all cunningly
fitted into that narrow confine. “We’ll
leave your luggage there for the moment
—till you decide where you want it,”
said Mr. Trimmer. “And now I’ll show
you.”
Joan, snarling ineffectively at the
enthusiasm of her sisters, now turned her
everlasting complaint to the heaps of
luggage on the verandah. “I can’t git in,”
she wailed. “And come here, you two! ”
she ordered Alice and Nellie, who were
climbing over.
“Never mind, never mind —it will
soon go to its proper place,” soothed
Mr. Trimmer; and the humor of it
struck him so forcibly that he again said
“Ha, ha!”
Scurrying feet sounded round the
house —and round and round the house.
Accompanied by yells, shouts, triumphs.
Joan said —“Those horrid boys!” The
boys found the open door and went over
the obstacles of suitcases and gear like
rock wallabies.
“Hey, Mum! Gee, this is a bonza
place!” cried one.
“There’s a heap of sand in the yard as
big as big!” called the other.
“And trees and trees!”
“And a little gate in the back fence!”
“And a big tree fallen down with a
ridey-cock-horse limb on it!”
“And a funny little hut in the bush! ”
“And an old man in it with a yellow
beard! ”
“And he says his name is Nosey
Bob”
“Will you boys keep quiet!” screamed
Joan.
“Ha, ha!” chortled Mr. Trimmer.
“What a paradise this is for boys! What a
great thing to be young! ”
ON this cheerful note Mr. Trimmer
proceeded with inspection. “Now,
here we are —end room there off
verandah —bed and all —I guess Joan
would like that.” The room was about
seven by five. Joan peered at it over the
luggage and sniffed. Mr. Trimmer
ignored the sniff. No agent worth his
Salt has ever heard such a thing as a sniff.
“And here. Mother, is the living-
room—see how compact everything is—
wireless there—settee here—a lovely
round table, that is—and here, your
fireplace—ha, ha, though, what a neat
little gadget that is!”
Mr. Trimmer eased his way past
chairs and table to a quaint little device
of cast-iron in the corner. In pure affec-
tion be patted—“ That’s a
fireplace if you like! Nice,
isn’t it? Nice, nice!” He
said “nice” in those rich
persuasive Kines that
mothers use when they give
very young children castor-
oil. “See—put so,me paper
in here ; then a bit of kind-
ling on top; then some
wood—Sid and Arthur will
get all the wood you want
from the bush —then some
coke on top of that. And
there you are. Nice! Mrs.
Trimmer is always wanting
me to get her one of these
Queen heaters. But you
can’t get them now. They
can’t get the labor to make
them. See, these lids lift
off.” He suited the action
to the enthusiasm, and re-
vealed two horribly sugges-
tive holes —if one’s mind
ran that way. “Get your
fire going and kettle here—
look! and a saucepan
there. Ha, ha! That? Oh,
that’s the flue-pipe—all
silver-frosted, too. Can you beat it?
Cold day—heat the room—boil your
kettle and your potatoes, all at once. Now
—here is the big bedroom! Ha, ha! But
you wouldn’t think there was a room
there at all —now would you? Wait! ”
The door from the verandah being open
obscured the door into the big room.
These doors worked on the higher
principles of jig-saws: the door of the
little end room was closed first of all,
after moving the comfy chair a little;
then the door of the living-room was
closed, and 10, the door of the “big”
room was not only revealed, but what
is more it could be opened—at least as
MR. PILGRIM.
far as a small wardrobe would grudg-
ingly allow it! In the “big” room,
so-called because it was slightly bigger
than the little end room, were two beds
with a passage-way between —a whole
eighteen inches of passage-way. “What
a compact room! Could you beat it?”
cooed Mr. Trimmer.
“And now,” he continued for the last
but not least, “added to all that is space-
conserving and labor-saving! And here
it is!” He stood two chairs on to the
settee, and another on to the round table
to make reasonable and adequate passage
for Mrs. Pilgrim’s bulk. “Look! Kitchen
here—and what a stove! Electric! Watch
—switch here—look! Turn this for High
—and again to Top. What a stove! Jug
here—take out pilot light and plug in for
jug. Wash-tubs here —yes, that’s right
—shift the meat-safe and ice-box —and
there you arc —copper for clothes —all
right to hand.”
Which was true enough. Evepdhing
in a space of six by four. Again Mr.
Trimmer said “Compact—modem—can
you beat it?”
Mrs, Pilgrim eyed this compactness
with the eye of misgiving and doubt, and
perhaps, too, even her vantiy had not lost
sight of the lack of that very same com-
pactness in her overgenerous proportions.
“But —but” she commenced.
“Exactly,” said Mr. Trimmer. “I know
—I know—and I might have said the
same thing myself. At first, that is.
But" —he heavily underlined the word —
“but, when you are used to it, you
wouldn’t have it any other way. And
look at the labor it saves! That’s what the
modem housewife needs. That’s the cry
of the moment. No longer shall the
patient wife be a slave.”
Mr. Trimmer declaimed these last
words and found gesture necessary in
doing so. With a sweep of his right arm
he dismissed the Past and its absurdly
patient wives; and in doing so he mis-
calculated the compactness. But only by
the further tips of his fingers. Still, that
was sufficient to dislodge an enamel sauce-
pan from its nail. This caused what is
generally known now as a chain reaction,
and dislodged many other saucepans, a
fryingpan, a dipper and two egg-lifts from
their nails. TTiey all went helter-skelter
into the wash-tubs with more clatter and
clang than twenty times that number of
saucepans and pans and egg-lifts and
dippers should make.
“Ha, ha! ” laughed Mr. Trimmer in the
greatest good humor. “Did you see
that? Well, doesn’t it go to show?”
SID and Arthur galloped from the yard,
“Mother! Here’s Nosey Bob! He
wants to know if you have something for
his spirit-lamp.”
“Who?”
“Nosey Bob!”
“Oh!”
Mr. Trimmer went into amused explana-
tion. “The old fellow with that hut down
in the bush. Metho—you know”
he raised his eyebrows significantly.
And added hastily, “Harmless —perfectly
harmless. Boys will get no
end of fun out of him.”
“Well —I’m sure —what”
Mrs. Pilgrim was
slightly perplexed.
“Perfectly harmless —but
I’ll word him just the same
if you like,” said Mr.
Trimmer. He went out and
interviewed Nosey Bob over
the fence. Here his tone
changed at once into some-
thing savage and formid-
able, unnecessarily fierce to
use on one so perfectly
harmless as Old Nosey. *
“Here you! Nothing!” he
called with tight lips.
“Nothing! ” A shaky shaggy
head and a dirty yellow
beard and a red nose of the
size and shape of an aver-
age quince viewed uncer-
tainly the irate face of Mr.
Trimmer and the extremely
interested faces of Sid and
Arthur —all three appearing
above the palings.
Nosey was trying to
realise the situation and the
possible failure of his mission. "It’s me
spurrit-lamp,” he croaked in practised
accents.
“You haven’t one—and now get going!
Clear out! Do you hear! And don’t come
back either! There’s nothing doing!”
This so far penetrated that Nosey Bob
turned and made off with blundering steps
through the ti-tree and lambertia.
“Now, listen, you shavers,” Mr.
Trimmer warned the boys, “keep away
from that fellow!”
Having disposed successfully of Nosey
Bob, Mr. Trimmer hastened back to the
kitchen, where Mrs. Pilgrim was trying to
get the “hang of things,” as she put it

“Gone!” said Mr. Trimmer.
“You can’t encourage him. But
perfectly harmless Now here
—just over here look—is your
bathroom Handv isn’t it? Step
straight out of the kitchen into
your bath And look—your
bath-heater—no, no, not electric,
not for a bath-heater! This is
a c/w>heater—old paper, bits of
cardboard; chips and sticks that
the boys will love to get for you
—and there’s a lovely hot bath!
Costs nothing to run, really—
and uses up all your rubbish—
that’s the main advantage.
really. Ha, ha! She’s a great
little gadget—only wish I could
get one for the wife. Labor
shortage of course—not making
them now.”
“Are they easy to work?”
“Oh lord! Easy! I should
say.”
“I think I’ll get Father to have
a look., Joan, where’s Father?”
“Father! Oh, he’s out in
front somewhere.”
“All right—don’t bother.”
Joan didn’t bother.
“And now”—Mr. Trimmer
gave that pause, almost a gasp
of admiration, specially reserved
for the last and greatest prize
of all—“ And now—here’s your
larvatree. Ha, ha!” chuckled
Mr. Trimmer. ’“Compact— four
rooms really in the space of one
—that’s what it really amounts
to.” He inclined one shoulder
to the left---“ Kitchen, laundry
(and pantry, too, for that
matter)”—he inclined the other
shoulder to the right—“bathroom
and larvatree.” Allowing time
for this to sink in—“ Now come
and view your home from with-
out—that’s good, weather clear-
ing—look at that!”
A MOMENTARY blue patch
in the clouds had actually
appeared —about the size of a
soup-plate. But undeniably blue.
It winked and blinked at them
and then disappeared. But it
had been there. Sleet and sago
had, however, given over, but
the wind was a yelling and
shrieking monster. “Good sign
that,” enthused Mr. Trimmer,
bracing himself to keep his bal-
ance in the blast. “Soon blow
the last of it away, that will.
Wind’s in the right quarter now.
Breeze like this soon blows away
the dirty weather. And all the
cobwebs, too, ha, ha! Now
look at it —would you think it
possible to have all that you’ve
got there in that space?”
Mrs. Pilgrim was looking at
the roof. She said: “Tin!”
“Iron,” said Mr. Trimmer in
unstinting praise. “Iron —and
galvanised and corrugated. It’s
the very latest —nothing so old-
fashioned as tiles or —pah!—
slate! Good, solid iron—the
newest thing for roofing.
Durable, neat, handsome —cool
in summer, warm in winter. Dry
at all 'times. And lovely when
it rains. Music! Ha, ha! That
is,” he hastened to add, “when
it does rain in Craigie Moor.”
Mrs. Pilgrim aired her little
knowledge.’
“Those walls —fibro”
“Fibro —I should say it is
fibro —worth its weight in gold
almost now. You can’t get fibro
now. It is the stuff for building,
and like the iron—warm in
winter and cool in summer. But
the Government has grabbed the
lot —for all those big building
projects round Sydney. Fibre’s
what they use —those Govern-
ment chaps know what’s what.
You simply can’t get fibro now.”
Sid and Arthur dived through
the little gate in the paling fence,
flushed with excitement and
daring. “Nosey Bob chased
us!” called out Sid.
“Couldn’t catch us —not a
ghost of a hopel” boasted
Arthur,
“You shouldn’t have gone
near him,” admonished Mrs.
Pilgrim.
“We didn’t —he was just out
there just now,”
“Harmless perfectly harm-
less,” said Mr. Trimmer.
Nosey’s disgraceful nose and
head and the wild tangle of
hairy growth appeared through
the little gate.
“Nothing doing, Nosey; off
you go, old chap,” said Mr.
Trimmer in the friendly warning
one gives to a playful pup. He
closed the gate. “He’s a real
character, is old Nosey—an old
identity, really, in Craigie
Moor,” he said for Mrs. Pil-
grim’s benefit.
JOAN appeared. She took in
the neat box-like structure
of “Cheddar” in one compre-
hensive glance. And for the
second time she sniffed.
“Where are Alice and Nellie?”
inquired Mrs. Pilgrim, rather to
hide the sniff than in thirst for
information.
“I don’t know,” replied Joan
very deliberately. “I think they
are fixing the Venetians. That is,
if they haven’t fixed them
already.” Joan said “fixed” with
awful ambiguity. And at that
very moment there was a most
impressive crash in the front of
the building which sent a visible
shudder through the whole struc-
ture.
“Oh my—what on earth!”
cried Mrs. Pilgrim
anxiously.
“I think,” said Joan, “they
have succeeded in fixing the
Venetians.”
“They do come with a rush,”
said Mr. Trimmer pleasantly and
anxiously. He hurried round the
side to the front. The heavy
Venetian had come down on one
side only like a half-opened fan.
It lent a rakish effect to the ap-
pearance of “Cheddar.” Through
the triangle of glass Alice and
Nellie could be seen perched on
the luggage and endeavoring to
make the other side come down.
All, no doubt, in the interests of
fixing things.
Joan and Mrs. Pilgrim had
followed Mr. Trimmer.
“Mother, really, you ought to
speak to those girls!” grumbled
Joan.
“It’s all right,” consoled Mr,
Trimmer. “No harm done at all.
Girls will be girls, you know.
Ha, ha!”
“Where’s Father?” inquired
Mrs. Pilgrim.
“There he is!” said Joan with
no pride at all.
MR. PILGRIM was stiff
standing where a footpath
might have been, still with the
rope in one hand and toma-
hawk in the other. Mr. King’s
truck was still standing on the
patch of rock and sand, and
Mr. King was doing something
inside the bonnet. Sid and
Arthur noted this new interest
and were about to rush out to
investigate and help.
“Come here, you two!”
ordered Joan. Sid and Arthur
hesitated. “At once! Do you
hear!” said Joan in her highest
but so often ignored authority.
Mr. Pilgrim half-turned his head
and his under-jaw could be seen
to work unsteadily. Whatever
was going on in his mind, it re-
solved itself into “Get back, or
I’ll belt you!”
At that the boys went no
further forward. Not that their
father was greatly given to belt-
ing them, but one never knew,
and there was something for-
bidding and ominous in his
present stiffness and silence.
“Father!” called Mrs. Pil-
grim.
But Mr. Pilgrim heeded not.
“Ah, well,” finalised Mr.
Trimmer, “I think you’ve about
seen it all now, and I won’t hold
up the good work of settling in
any longer. Settling in, ha, ha!
What a great time you have be-
fore you! And if there’s any-
thing you want, just you let me
know. Anything at all—any-
thing that’s missing or wanting
—and I’ll see to it that you get
it,” But even in Craigie Moor
caution is not altogether un-
known, so Mr. Trimmer added
“Anything in reason. But let
me know —and I’ll get it for you.
Anything in reason, ha, ha! ”
He looked lovingly on the
visible portions of the Pilgrim
family. “I want you to be com-
fortable and happy. Anything
—in reason,”
He departed in his neat little
blue car—bumpity-bump, hop-
pity-hop, skippity-skip over the
ruts and rocks and die knobby
vestiges of stumps of McKell-
street.
A GREAT resolve took hold
of Mr, Pilgrim. Firmly,
with that get-thee-behind-me-
Satan decision, he hurled the
rope and tomahawk over the
front fence as though these were
methods at once degrading and
inconvenient. He said to him-
self with full and comprehensive
glance at “Cheddar”: “A shack
—just a bloody shack!”
Then he walked to the truck
as Mr. King’s head appeared
from the bonnet. “Tell me,”
he said, “where is the pub?”
Beneath the bulbous red nose
of Mr. King there somewhere
beat a heart of gold: “She’s
fixed, and I’m going. Hop in
and come along. It’s where I
was going myself.”
With a whole series of explo-
sions like a minor artillery en-
gagement, Mr. King’s truck
nosed its way along McKell-
street.
Mrs. Pilgrim heard, saw,
understood and was relieved.
“Now, children,” she said,
“we’ll all buck in and get things
fixed. And we’re all going to
have a good time. Not an angry
word and not a grizzle from
anyone.”
Joan sniffed for the fourth
time.
And Sid and Arthur an-
nounced joyfully—“ Here’s old
Nosey Bob again!”
The Missal.
The lovely, lost, italic curve
Enrapt his soul. All day he
stared
At A for Apple. Dimly heard
The beating of the holy wings
In D for Dove; but shut his
ears
To sound’s delight, instead pre-
ferred
The E of Eden, marked how
stood
The mainstroke like a flaming
sword.
Then F for Fall. How brief the
flight
With dark descender, black as
night I
The circumscribed, enchanting
sweep
Of G was Goodness, calm and
strong.
Gently it led his eye along
Delicious pastures of the page.
Then, overleaf, before him
burned
The winged and serif ed letter H
And Heaven was his to have and
hold —
Oh missal wrought in holy gold.
The arrogance of earthly power
—Swash capitals for Kings and
Men —
Diminished as he turned again
And summoned all his art to
raise
The lettered record of his
praise—
“ Ere there was beast or fish or
bird.
Before the Voice of Man was
heard ;
In the Beginning was the Word.”

As sure as that an honest man

And doubtless as the fact that

Is this: when list’ning-in to

It’s absolutely certain that the

—Sydney “Daily Telegraph."
It’s little wonder that today
Each thoughtful citizen en-
dorses
Those critics who condemn the
way
That couples rush into
divorces
Like children quarrelling at play.
For though the argument is
sound
That partners subject to
abuses
Should gain their freedom, any
ground
Seems cause enough, and
cheap excuses
Today increasingly are found.
So let us thank the judge astute
Who left potential plaintiffs
gasping
With words of wisdom which
refute
The notion that a voice that’s
rasping
Is grounds enough to file a suit.

True to Form.
The chairman of the Persim-
mon Marketing Board (ex-
secretary of the Coffimunist-
“ Well , he certainly didn't pick it up from ME, Selby!"
controlled Wire - stretchers’
Union) came into his luxurious
office and punched a bell on his
desk. A few seconds later the
board’s Chief Economic Plan-
ning Officer entered.
“Look ’ere, Mr. Bohndohm,”
said the chairman, “I understood
the board was to be assured of
a scarcity o’ persimmons this
year.”
“That’s right; there is a
scarcity,” replied the C.E.P.0.,
who was a nephew of somebody
in Canberra. “Mind, it wasn’t
an easy job, owing to there
being a record crop, but we
managed it.”
“Y’ follered the technik o’ the
mob lookin’ after the marketin’
of apples an’ pears?”
“Precisely. We bought the
entire crop of every persimmon-
orchardist, paying the owners
on an estimated-tree-yield basis.
Thus every persimmon in the
country belongs to the board.
The only difference in our
methods was that instead of
letting the fruit fall on the
ground and being left to rot we
instructed the growers to case it
up and send it in to the board’s
depots.”
“Don’t tell me the public was
able t’ buy it reasonable!”
“Heavens, no ! We weren’t so
crude as all that, sir. We waited
till the fruit was completely ripe
on the tree, in that thoroughly
soft condition in which it should
be eaten, before ordering it to
be packed. We were able to
effect double-handling charges
by having the entire crop sent
straight out to the tip to be
dumped immediately our inspec-
tors had examined it on arrival.
Of course we had to pay the men
handling it the ten shillings a
day nuisance-money they de-
manded because of the fruit run-
ning into their boots while they
were unloading it at the tip.
“Well,” remarked the chair-
man, “we won’t bellyache about
that. In fact, it’ll be ’andy. I
was beginnin’t’ git a bit worried
—the loss on marketin’ opera-
tions this year ain’t as big as
usual, and if the downward
trend kept goin’ the position’d
be gettin’ serious. Nex’ thing
we’d know the board’d be
makin’ a profit—an’ if that
’appened I’d be the laughin’-
stock of all the other boards.
But wot I wanted y’ for is this.
Cornin’ to the office this mornin’
I see persimmons for sale in a
shop-winder at on’y fourpence
each. They ain’t ours, surely.”
“Of course not. Apart from
the fact that every case the board
controlled finished up being
dumped, the fruit we handle
couldn’t possibly be sold at less
than a shilling each—anyone
selling below that figure is, as
you know, liable to prosecu-
tion.”
“Then ’ow the devil did them
I saw come to be marketed?”
“Probably the shopkeeper ob-
tained them from some back-
yard-gardener who had a tree or
two.”
“Do y’ mean t’ tell me, Bohn-
dohm, that there are people ’oo
’aye the ’ide t’ think they can
still do wot they like with their
own property? Where do they
think they’re livin’ —in a de-
mocracy or somethink? Wot’s
goin’ to ’appen to this ’ere board
if every bloke’s allowed to sell
persimmons for wot ’e can git
for ’em, an’ that can be resold
at any margin o’ profit the re-
seller thinks fit? Why! This’d
be goin’ back to the bad ole
days o’ the law o’ supply an’
demand, when people could git
fruit, an’ plenty of it, at a rea-
sonable price. That’s a thing
no Guvverment board could
tolerate. If we can’t arrange for
fruit t’ be scarce and at sky-
’igh prices we’d be failin’ down
on our jobs.
“We’ll use the Star Chamber
powers conferred on us be the
Act t’ find out from this ’ere
shopkeeper where ’e got ’is fruit
from, an’ we can order the bloke
’oo supplied ’im t’ chop ’is trees
down. By the way, Bohndohm,
’ow is that special job you are
on goin’?”
“That brochure? I nearly
have it finished. The photo-
gravure plates and art paper
we’re using will help boost our
deficit —we might even get it to
as big as last year’s with a bit
of luck. I’m only waiting now
on a few more special recipes
before sending it to the printers.”
“Well,” said the chairman,
“better push a’ead with it. To
boost the board’s Eat More
Persimmons campaign we’ll
’ave t’ make certain that the
distributin’ of the ’alf million
copies o’ the brochure t’ ’ouse-
wives’ll coincide with next sea-
son’s shortage, durin’ which we
’ope to ’ave persimmons sellin’
for one-an’-a-zac each.”

Ancestors of
an Industry
H. G. J. Moseley, whose brilliantly promis-
ing career came to a tragic end on the Gallipoli
beaches when he was only 28, will always be
remembered for his discovery that the atomic
nucleus has an electrical charge, the size of
which is characteristic of the atom. The numeri-
cal value of this charge is known as the Atomic
Number. Moseley’s discovery has been of the
greatest importance in the subsequent develop-
ment of atomic physics. The son of a distin-
guished zoologist, Moseley was born at Wey-
mouth, Dorset, in 1887. After a brilliant career
at Eton and Trinity College, Oxford, he became
a lecturer in physics at Manchester University.
He resigned this appointment two years later,
when he was elected to the John Harling Fellow-
ship. His labours were interrupted by the out-
break of war in 1914, but not
before he had accomplished the
researches which were destined to
have a dramatic effect on the
course of the second World War.

AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
In providing a swag of new
starting-stalls for the running of
Saturday’s Canberra Stakes the late
governing body evidently forgot one
old racing maxim—“ The bigger the
field the greater the certainty.”
* * * *
It required a good measure of the
super-optimism with which all pun-
ters are fortunately endowed to tackle
the long card of big fields constitut-
ing the programme at Rosehill on
Saturday. And, as might have been
expected, the bookies had much the
best of the argument. The S.T.C. is
at present altering the layout of
Rosehill, and, with that job incom-
plete, Saturday’s principal event, the
Festival Handicap, was run over the
odd distance of 7 furlongs 81yds.,
which made it a good Villiers test.
The Festival Handicap was a very
rough-run race, with about half-a-
dozen horses striking bad interfer-
ence. However, the grey Roxburgh
five-year-old Blue Ensign, who was
well and truly on the receiving end
of some of the strife, did very well
in overcoming difficulties to win by a
neck from Wiranya and Caruso, be-
tween whom the margin was a nose.
Blue Ensign’s was a good Villiers
trial, and so, too, was Wiranya’s.
Connections have had very bad luck
with Wiranya, a most consistent
placegetter who, however, now a
four-year-old, has only one win to
his credit. In his last seven starts,
over a variety of distances, Wiranya
has been only once out of a place,
finishing 13th in the Metropolitan
after running third in the Epsom.
He’s due for a change of luck, and
the Villiers would suit him perfectly
—his only win was over a mile, when
he beat a first-class bunch of three-
year-olds at Randwick.
If the winner of the forthcoming
Summer Cup was among those who
contested the 10-furlongs Rosehill
Handicap it would most probably be
Snowstream. Carrying 9.5, at which
he was conceding other runners 91b.
and upward, Snowstream finished
brilliantly from the tail of the field
to run third, beaten by margins of a
half-head and a head. Duke of Syke
(G. Moore), carrying Bst., was the
winner, with Brig o’ Doon (7.4) the
runner-up; the winner’s time, 2Ai>
was a race-record.
Champion galloper of a few years
back, and now standing at L. B.
Israel’s Segenhoe Stud, High Caste
received a good advertisement as a
sire when three of his sons were
successful at Rosehill; Karangi (N.
Sellwood) won the Two-year-old
Maiden for colts and geldings, High
Spirits (W. Cook) the Auburn Mixed
(lOf.) and High Ideals (N. Sellwood)
the Welter (9f.). High Castes first /
progeny raced in the 1945-46 season,
when three of his youngsters, filling
minor placings, amassed the modest
total of £330 in stakes. In successive
seasons since then High Caste has
steadily progressed up the list of
principal winning sires until last
season he was in the first 20, with
28 winners of 54 races and some
£20,000 in stakes.
Prior to the adoption of the photo-
finish gear now in use on Sydney
courses, this page strongly opposed
the device on the ground that it was
too accurate in splitting finishes
which common-sense (and any judge)
would be content to call a deadheat.
Many of those who backed favorite
Veiled Art in Saturday’s first
Parramatta Mixed may now share
that opinion. No doubt twitching
one nostril at the crucial moment,
the Coronation Day filly New
Look beat the favorite by, officially,
a nose —to be more accurate,
according to the calculation of
the gentleman who operates the
camera, by .8175 of an inch. It
is to be feared that the class of ear-
bashers who specialise in reiterating
their hard-luck punting experiences
are going to become quite unbearable
with four places of decimals at their
command.

Charity meetings in Melbourne are
always noticeably poorly attended,
and Saturday’s V.R.C. Benevolent
Fund fixture at Flemington was no
exception, though conditions were
perfect. Admittedly it was not a
particularly attractive card.
Flemington trainer T. Lewis dealt
the books a hefty blow when
he saddled up three winners—all
favorites. First instalment of this
three-barrelled attack was the Kinder-
scout colt Merry Scout in the
Maroondah Handicap for two-year-
olds. Hopping straight into the lead,
Merry Scout made every post a win-
ner to score by three lengths from
Flying Hero and Glen lan; showing
a fine turn of speed, he cut out the
5 furlongs in 60fsec.
It had been expected that A.
Breasley would have the mount on
Merry Scout, but he rode, instead,
Culver City, from the Hoysted stable,
the winner being ridden by G.
Bougoure. Breasley was, however,
on the other two Lewis-trained win-
ners, Sentiment and Sanctus. Senti-
ment’s mission was the 6-furlongs
Kingsville Handicap, in which, with
topweight of 9.1, he did a good job
to score by a length. After trying
“Well, everyone's gone , and only the favorite and I are
left at our posts."
to lead throughout, the New Zealand-
bred Peter Robinson deadheated for
second with Chatspa, stablemate of
the winner and starting at 66 to 1.
The aged Parenthesis gelding Sanc-
tus had a shade too much class for
Colin and a good deal too much
for any other of the poor bunch
contesting the 13-furlongs Benevolent
Handicap. Sanctus had moved up to
take charge entering the straight; in
the run to the judge he was joined by
Colin, the pair well clear of the field,
and, fighting on gamely, Sanctus scored
by a head with Plovarius a distant
third.
Glen Devon seemed the unlucky
runner in the Catani Handicap for
three-year-olds. In the process ol
making a promising-looking run as
they rounded the turn he clipped
another horse’s heels, stumbled and
very nearly came down, but still
managed to run fourth, a couple ol
lengths behind the winner, Bewitched
(D. Cameron). A daughter of Great
Legend, Bewitched had been con-
sidered good enough earlier in the
season to contest the One Thousand
Guineas, the Derby and the Oaks
(with no luck), but she found Satur-
day’s 10-furlongs journey and more
moderate company closer to her
capacity. Bewitched scored by a head
from Zezette, with Postmistress third.
Only runners in the Lowan Hurdle
with any pretensions to class were
Latani, handicapped at 12.11, and
Rebel Regis, who had 10.10; next m
the weights was Salandra with 9.8.
Punters agreed with the handicapper
and supported the two topweights tc
equal favoritism at 9 to 4. At the
weights Latani didn’t do too badly
to finish a closish third, Rebel Regis
winning narrowly from Better Days.

The splendid performances overseas
of the Australian cyclists Alf Strom
and Roger Arnold have so enthralled
The Bulletin’s tame vegetarian that
he hasn’t made one reference to
George Bernard Shaw in the past six
weeks; Strom and Arnold, it is under-
stood, both purchase their weekend
meat at the greengrocer’s. Following
their success in the New York inter-
national six-day race, the Australian
pair last week finished an unlucky
second, beaten by one lap, in the
Berlin six-day race. Winners were
an Italian pair, who, however, had
notched up only 195 sprint points to
the Australians’ 309.

N.S.W. tennis fans had the stiff
luck to see at the State champion-
ships recently a Drobny who,- with
no time to settle into local condi-
tions, was palpably right off his game.
A couple of weeks made all the
difference, and it was another Drobny
altogether who fairly blasted his way
to the Victorian title at Kooyong,
Melbourne, on Saturday. Beating
en route McGregor, Quist and Brom-
wich, Drobny reached and won the
final against Sidwell without losing
a set; he took the final 6-4, 6-3, 11-9.
Drobny’s main weapon is a searing
service which, when it’s on the mark,
is simply unplayable. Partnered by
Miss Fitch, Drobny also won the
mixed doubles, beating Mrs. Bolton-
Colin Long, but the old firm of
Bromwich-Quist proved too wily for
the Drobny-Long combination in the
men’s doubles final; Bromwich-Quist,
6-4, 6-0, 7-5.

Highlight of the Sheffield Shield
match S.A. v. Vic. in Adelaide last
week was a first-wicket partnership
of 337 by Colin McDonald and Ken
Meuleman in Victoria’s second
innings; McDonald broke the part-
nership when he was caught at 186 —
Meuleman made 150, First-innings
scores were South Australia 284,
Victoria 364. Going for the outright
win, Victoria closed at five for 442
in the second innings, but the South
Australians, batting stubbornly, saw
out the time and had lost 5 for 314
when the match finished; a first-
innings win for Victoria.

The Australian cricketers have taken
most of the battle honors in their
invasion of South Africa, but they
have suffered heavy casualties. With
Hassett, Lindwall, lan Johnson, Bill
Johnston and Langley all more or
less hors de combat there were only
10 really fit men available for the
match v. Transvaal, which began at
Johannesburg on Saturday; lan
Johnson, however, was selected as
the least seriously damaged. Forced
to bat first on a sticky pitch, of
which the S’African spin-merchants
made deadly use, the Australians, at
the end of the first day’s play, found
themselves, for the first time on the
tour, in a pretty ticklish position. In
very shaky fashion the tourists
managed to scrape up a total of 84,
only Morris (15) and Archer (20
n. 0.) achieving double figures. In
reply, Transvaal had lost 5 for 80
when stumps were drawn in the
gloom of impending further rain.
Early in the week the tourists had
played a drawn match v. Western
Province and had beaten Western
Province Country Districts by an
innings—a match in which Arthur
Morris achieved the rare effort of a
century before lunch.
Keith Miller has caught up with
the tourists and is almost certain to
play in the first Test v. S’Africa,
which starts on December 24. Mean-
while, on the home-front, Ron James
has been picked to replace Miller as
captain of the N.S.W. team for the
southern tour against South Aus-
tralia and Victoria later this month.

Olympic sculling champion Merv
Wood bagged a double in the
Empire Games test races rowed on
the Nepean at Penrith (N.S.W.) on
Saturday. His easy win in the single
sculls was, of course, a foregone
conclusion; in addition, Wood part-
nered his fellow Police Club oars-
man M. Riley to win the double
sculls. An accumulation of poor
staff-work in connection with the
coxswainless pairs test resulted finally
in a decision to re-row the event
at a later date. After the umpire’s
launch had broken down and one
of the teams had collided with a
bridge the Richmond (Vic.) pair,
Lambert and Webster, had been first
past the post in Saturday’s version of
the event.

A boxer of real class, Ray Cole-
man (8.1 If) gave another tip-top
performance in outpointing Victorian
Danny Hirsch (8.Ilf) at Leichhardt.
Seen as a forceful fighter in his pre-
vious Sydney appearances, Hirsch
tried to crowd Coleman early, but
foun4 that he’d picked the wrong
man for such tactics and was soon
himself on the retreat. Fighting
desperately to try to retrieve the
lost cause, Hirsch won rounds eight
and nine, but the rest went to Cole-
man, who is now seeking a bout with
another Melboumite in Bernie Grant,
recognised as Australian featherweight
champion since Eddie Miller turned
it in.

New Insecticides.
THE WAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
‘J.R.D.”: Those discussed at
a recent veterinary conference
included D.D.T., benzene hexa-
chloride (B.H.C.) and its active
component, the gamma isomer
produced by I.C.I. as “gam-
mexane,” chlordane, toxaphene,
methoxychlor and E605. Though
all are used extensively abroad
and here as horticultural and
agricultural sprays and dusts, the
discussion was limited to their
veterinary use for control of ex-
ternal parasites of stock.
The point was stressed that
while any one insecticide gave
better results than the others
when used at certain strengths
against a certain parasite, no
single insecticide could or should
be regarded as a cure-all.
Another point is whether, in
view of the tremendous hitting
power of available insecticides,
it might not be better to concen-
trate research on their possi-
bilities, rather than on new pro-
ducts.
There is need for more work
to be done in Australia, as con-
ditions here are so different that
overseas results do not always
apply. As a result, many stock-
owners who relied on overseas
reports lost faith in the new in-
secticides.
A successful insecticide must
be capable of production at rea-
sonable cost, safe to handle by
the ultimate user and non-toxic
to the animal while highly toxic
to the parasite. Of those quoted,
E605 has the lowest safety fac-
tor. Except perhaps for certain
specified jobs it is unlikely to
supersede those in general use.
Chlordane is a liquid, but as
it has not been available here
for dollar reasons, little work
has been done. In general
efficiency it is rated as between
D.D.T. and B.H.C. For the
same economic reason, little is
known of toxaphene, but it is
stated to be more toxic to
domestic animals than D.D.T.
The main research has been
on D.D.T. and B.H.C. or “gam-
mexane.” Briefly, by compari-
son, B.H.C. is superior in killing-
power on parasites and is safer
to use on animals, but D.D.T.
lasts longer and therefore gives
a longer period of protection.
For treating exposed surfaces,
such as walls, yard-rails, etc., to
kill insect pests on contact,
D.D.T. will give best results.
B.H.C. has the advantage of
fumigant effect, an advantage
when applied to the fleece.
D.D.T. has an irritant effect on
the feet of insects alighting on
treated areas and may therefore
defeat its object of permitting
the insect to pick up a lethal dose
before it is repelled. These are
recommendations when to use
D.D.T. or B.H.C.: —
Buffalo-fly: Spray cattle with
D.D.T. emulsion at 1 p.c. to 4 p.c.,
or use a D.D.T. dip.
Cattle-lice; B.H.C. as a dust or
spray gives slightly better kills than
D.D.T.
Cattle-ticks: Dipping in D.D.T.
(0.5 p.c. para para) gives full protec-
tion for seven to 10 days and reason-
able protection for five to six weeks.
B.H.C. (0.05 p.c. gamma isomer)
gives five days’ absolute protection
and reasonable protection for four
weeks. Both have the advantage over
arsenic of no scalding or after-effects,
and by using either at greater
strength a longer period of protection
is obtainable.
Sheep-ked and body-lice: D.D.T.
dip (0.1 p.c. para para) and B.H.C.
or gammexane (0.007 p.c. gamma
isomer) remain effective in the fleece
for three to four weeks.
Foot-louse: B.H.C. (0.007 p.c.
gamma isomer) gives best results.
Itch-mite in sheep: Neither D.D.T.
nor B.H.C. has given complete kills;
dipping in lime-sulphur is recom-
mended.
Sheep-blowfly: Much work still to
be done, but good results obtained
by dipping or spraying with B.H.C.
(0.056 p.c. gamma isomer). For pro-
tection of rams’ heads gammexane
(0.12 p.c.) is recommended, and a
similar strength for treating fly-struck
areas. For the latter purpose D.D.T.
(1 p.c. para para) gives good results.
Pigs: Much work still to be done,
but gammexane promises well for
lice and mange.
Dogs: Fleas and lice can be cop-
trolled effectively by gammexane
“But, doctor, I don't WANT to be up in time for
Christmas!”
emulsion (0.01 p.c.) or dust (0.1 p.c.),
while D.D.T. as 5 p.c. dust or 1 p.c.
wash is useful. Mange: Gammexane
(0.1 p.c.) cures the commonest form
of mange. Use as a wash or oint-
ment. Dog-paralysis tick: A weekly
bath or spray of gammexane (0.1 p.c.)
gives complete protection.
Grass- or harvest-mites: Spray
lawns with B.H.C. emulsion (0.007
p.c. gamma isomer).
Cats: Owing to their habit of lick-
ing themselves frequently there is a
degree of risk in using any insec-
ticide. B.H.C. is probably the least
dangerous, and should be rubbed in
as an ointment (0.1 p.c. gamma
isomer), leaving no surplus.
Poultry: To control lice, D.D.T.
1 p.c. powder or B.H.C. (0.1 p.c.)
powder in nests gives good results,
or paint roosts with B.H.C. 1 p.c.
solution, which has a fumigating
effect. B.H.C. will also control red-
mite, and can be used to fumigate
fowl-houses in the form of gam-
mexane smoke-candles.
Fowl-tick and stickfast-flea: Can
be controlled by a 1 p.c. D.D.T. or
0.1 p.c. B.H.C. dip.
Lambing Losses.
“Outback”: Recent investiga-
tions have focused attention on
the serious proportions of losses
between birth and marking.
Often the ewe is also lost at
lambing-time, for which reason
many properties write off 10
per cent, of their breeding ewes
each year to cover expected
G. R. Moule and M. N. S.
Jackson, in the “Queensland
Agricultural Journal,” say a
recent survey of opinion among
sheepmen showed that the
majority considered that, in an
average year, losses varied be-
tween 5 per cent and 12 per cent,
of lambs bom, while one
property quoted reliable figures
indicating that losses of stud
lambs before marking had aver-
aged about I2j per cent, per
annum, sometimes higher.
During drought years, or
when lambing occurred in
extremely hot weather, or when
dingoes were bad, disastrous re-
sults were obtained. In one stud
flock only eight lambs of 200
bora survived to marking-time,
and on another occasion 600
lambs from about 800 perished
on a waterhole during a heat-
wave. In a test in north-west
Queensland, under favorable
conditions, 22 per cent, of the
lambs were lost within the first
few days of birth.
Reviewing the causes of these
heavy piortalities, Moule and
Jackson state that pregnancy
toxaemia is fairly common
amongst breeding ewes in
Queensland, and it was difficult
to treat affected sheep. It
usually occurred when ewes in
advanced pregnancy were sub-
jected to a period of starvation,
such as occurred during a rail
journey, or to rather sudden
variations in their plane of nutri-
tion. Affected sheep stand about
in a listless fashion, appear to
be blind'and are disinclined to
feed, but may grind their teeth.
Milk fever (hypocalcaemia), an-
other cause of losses, was easy to
treat with subcutaneous injec-
tions of from lioz. to 2oz. of 20
per cent, solution of calcium
borogluconate.
Mastitis (inflammation of the
udder), well-known amongst
dairy cows, was probably more
common amongst ewes than
generally imagined, A few cases
had been observed amongst ewes
under close observation at
lambing-time, and on some
properties the disease had
reached outbreak proportions.
Prompt treatment with the drug
sulphamezathine—l" gram for
every 15 lb. liveweight—or the
infusion of solutions of calcium
penicillin into the udder, was
necessary in most cases to save
affected animals.
In Queensland a large number
of ewes lamb at a time when
pastures are deficient in vitamin
A, and there is reason to believe
that this deficiency might be a
contributory cause to losses of
baby lambs. During times of
plenty, the sheep stores this vital
substance in its liver, to use
when the pastures become dry.
Making sure that ewes have a
vitamin A and protein-rich
supplement during the latter
stages, of pregnancy—if grass is
dry—is helpful in reducing
losses.
Crossing Potatoes.
“Walrus”: I have cross-
pollenised Carmen No. 2 and
Katahdin potatoes, and the
Katahdin produced seed-pods
closely resembling small toma-
toes (potatoes and tomatoes
being near-relations). From the
resultant seed I grew the best
potatoes I have ever eaten, and
now go on producing them
from tubers.
It is significant that Katahdins,
a relatively new variety, fre-
quently produce seed - pods,
whereas the older-established
varieties don’t. My guess is that
with these older varieties the
practice of using the tubers for
successive plantings for so many
generations has caused the seed-
producing capacity to atrophy
by a sort of relation-back to the
non-origin from seed—a normal
process of nature —or, another
way of putting it (and as Dar-
win would probably have ex-
plained it), nature is adapting it-
self to the conditions imposed
on the plant, and its unused
faculties die out.
Water.
“Myrrhee”: A 10 p.c. loss of
bodyweight in water will mean
death to most animals, whereas
all fats and 50 p.c. of proteins
could disappear without neces-
sarily proving fatal. Water
softens coarse foods, dissolves
the nutrients contained in food-
stuffs, facilitates the movement
of digested food in solution, re-
moves waste products and regu-
lates body temperature.
It’s not easy to estimate the
quantity consumed by various
animals —horses, cattle, sheep,
pigs or fowls, as so many fac-
tors play a part in determining
how much an animal will drink.
Dryness of feed or exercise will
increase drinking, luscious green
fodder will reduce it. On an
average a horse will drink 10-
15gal. a day; bullocks and dry
cows 7-10 gal.; milking cows 7-
lOgal. for maintenance and
Hgal. for each gallon of milk
produced.
A fully-grown sheep will
drink up to l^gal.; a ewe nurs-
ing a lamb as much as 3gal.
Pigs on dry mash need plenty
of water in addition to any
skim-milk they may get. A fat-
tening pig requires Ugal. ; a
brood sow 4-sgal. For fowls
provide a gallon for each 20
birds, allowing a margin for
waste.
Calcium.
“M.”: Young growing stock
and breeding and milking
animals need it, and the best
way to see that they get it is to
topdress pastures with super.
Most of the concentrated feed-
ing-stuffs, cereal grains particu-
larly, are calcium-deficient, and
this has to be made good.
To each 1001 b, of grain fed to
horses, cattle, sheep and pigs
mix 31b. of a lick consisting of
four parts of lime to one part
of salt. For poultry lime is sup-
plied in the shellgrit, but the
birds will still need lib. of salt
to 1001 b. of mash. For pigs cal-
cium won’t be necessary if they
are receiving a daily supplement
of separated milk, buttermilk or
whey.
Wool Films.
“C.S.”: Three new educa-
tional films made by the Aus-
tralian Wool Board, “Shearing
Hygiene,” “Pulpy Kidney” and
“Vaccines and Vaccination,” will
be sent to Departments of Agri-
culture in all States for exhibi-
tion to woolgrowers. Copies
will also be sent to the Inter-
national Wool Secretariat, Lon-
don, the Wool Bureau, New
York, and the Wool Boards of
New Zealand and South Africa.
At a later stage copies will be
added to the board’s film library
for use on loan to interested
organisations. It is hoped that
copies will be available at an
early date.
Turnip Oil.
“K.H.H.”; Experiments in
South Australia with the seed
of wild turnip for extraction of
an oil which compares favorably
with mustard-seed oil promises
a use for a weed now a menace
to wheatgrowers.
The experiments are being
made by L. H. Ellis, a Riverton
flourmiller, who has received
favorable reports on samples
sent to India and South-east
Asia, where he hopes to estab-
lish an export market.
Ellis, who already exports a
•large quantity of mustard-seed
oil to these places, as well as
supplying a large inter-State and
S.A. market, said that he de-
cided to try the wild turnip
when he found he could not get
enough mustard-seed. The oil
has the same purity (98 p.c.) as
mustard-seed oil, tastes sweeter,
has clearer color and will not go
rancid.
Mustard-seed oil is used for
salad-dressings and other cook-
ing purposes, and as a base for
hair preparations and perfumes.
The residue is in great demand
among poultry-farmers for lay-
ing mashes.
Early Entry for Horses.
“Clyde”: Only about a month
is left for intending competitors
in horse events at Sydney Royal
Show next Easter to get their
entries in. There is special need
for early entry, because the
R.A.S. has had to adopt a pre-
selection system, and the sooner
it has the entries the simpler its
work becomes.
Reason for the new system is
that accommodation for the
growing number of horse entries
is strictly limited. The R.A.S.,
like so many other organisations,
has been unable to carry out its
building plans and simply hasn’t
the room for all the horses it
would like to see on the grounds.
Nominations must be in by
January 7, and will be examined
and decisions of acceptance
made by January 31, and all,
nominators will be informed ail
to whether they are in or out.
Drenching a Sheep.
“M.”: Make sure that the
sheep is standing squarely on its
feet and hold the nose level with
the eyes. Grasp the head firmly
but not tightly, four fingers
under the lower jaw, thumb
over the nose. • Pass the gun
through the side of the mouth,
over the tongue and between the
back teeth. Inject the dose
slowly, lowering the head at
once if the sheep begins to
cough. To save the delicate
mouth membranes slip a piece of
rubber tubing over the nozzle,
the end projecting slightly over
the point.
Feeding Farm Fowls.
“Sarina”: They can be a poor
investment unless a lot of their
feed is farm-grown (B. 5/10/’49).
Sunflowers and grain sorghum
(Kaffir corn or one of the dwarf
varieties) may both be grown

during the warm months in
Queensland, and the seed bagged
for use later. They’ll both grow
on ordinary soils with a little
water, but maize is harder of cul-
tivation.
Greens are easily grown in a
fertile corner. A group of bird’s-
eye chillies will maintain them-
selves on any soil in warm
coastal districts.
Sometimes a little food is avail-
able free. For instance, there
are white-ants whose nests are
plentiful in some Queensland
areas. It is only necessary to lift
the nests whole and grind them
to powder in the fowlyard. The
fowls will then eat the ants.
Starter Hints.
“Bill C.”: The self-starter
often refuses to work because the
battery is not properly con-
nected. The car may run (after
being cranked) when the elec-
trical connections are loose
enough to be lifted off the
battery poles at will, but the
starter, will not work unless
there’s a definite connection.
Have the battery out regularly,
wash off all dirt, and mop it dry.
Scrape the posts to brightness.
The grey or greenish material
around the posts is easily re-
moved with a rag dipped in bak-
ing-soda solution.
Don’t let soda get into the
battery, or it will have to be
washed out and refilled with
fresh acid at a service depot.
Moisture on top of a battery
causes it to “run down” prema-
turely. Watch out for “sweat-
ing,” especially during humid
weather. And letting the cells
go dry causes lasting injury to
the battery.
Regrowth Control.
“K.W.R.”: Investigations into
timber-regrowth control were de-
scribed by W. J. Bisset at Rodds
Bay (C.Q.). A solution contain-
ing 0.5 p.c. of 2,4-D acid gave a
complete kill of 45 p.c. of trees
and 75 p.c. of stumps. An
arsenical solution containing
6.4 p.c. arsenic trioxide (weight/
volume) applied at the same time
killed all tops, but suckering
occurred in every case. It gave a
40 p.c. kill when applied to cut
stumps.
At a strength of 1 p.c., 2,4-D
acid, the hormone weedicide,
gave a complete kill of 95 p.c. of
trees and 78 p.c. of stumps. No
arsenical treatment was included
in this test.
With larger trees (diameter
2in. to 4in.) the poison solution
is applied to frill-cuts at or near
ground-level. Smaller trees and
bushes are chopped right off and
poison applied to the cut surface
of stumps. Amount of solution
required varies according to tree
size, but over a large number of
trees has averaged about one
fluid ounce.
Hormone weedicides are avail-
able at prices which compare
favorably with those of standard
arsenical compounds. They are
free also from risk of poisoning
humans and livestock. Effective-
ness of different compounds at
various strengths, and the influ-
ence of time of year, are being
investigated.
Hints for the Farm.
“W. Court”: Throw out grain
sorghum to fowls without first
getting them gradually accus-
tomed to it, and they’ll most
likely leave it untouched. The
grain is low in protein, the flesh-
forming element, and the grow-
ing sorghum plant and its ratoons
are a menace to stock unless well
fenced off.
, “Wilco”: New pig - raisers
often don’t think of providing
summer shelters for their pigs
until the sun knocks some of
them over. Trees give the best
shelter, but it is necessary to
fence these off to prevent the
pigs from barking them. Where
there are bushes handy, one way
of providing shelter in summer is
to have a separate paddock
joined to the main paddock by a
narrow lane. This shelter pad-
dock may be thick bush en-
closed by an electric fence or
pig-netting.
“K.T.”: Don’t wait until your
pullets are about to lay before
you take them to the permanent
laying quarters, or you may
bring about a false moult. They
should be moved before the
combs redden. Also, when
changing the ration do it gradu-
ally.
“C.A.A.”; Costing less than
a permanent pasture to estab-
lish, lucerne is one of the most
valuable of crops. On a well-
drained soil preparation of the
seed-bed should be similar to
that for permanent pasture.
Where the crop is to follow
pasture, break soil early by skim
ploughing; then plough deep
and cultivate to make a firm
bed. Careful surface cultiva-
tion will ensure a minimum of
weed-seeds gaining a hold be-
fore sowing.
“Sundowner”: To guard
against lameness in sheep after
dipping in the newer dips—in-
cluding gammexane —S.A. De-
partment of Agriculture advises
the following: Clean dip
thoroughly before use; keep
yards around the dip clean;
don’t dip earlier than seven to
ten days offshears (this would
allow Wounds to heal); for pre-
ference, use your own dip rather
than a community one. '
“A.M.M.”: Impaction in cows
should be treated by giving the
animals fib. of salts, loz. of
powdered ginger and 11b. to 2lb.
of molasses in a quart of warm
water. Keep the cow warm and
give plenty of water, but no solid
food. A bran mash is nourish-
ing, laxative and easily digested.
“Billjim”; Yellow - maize is
particularly valuable as a pig-
food. It is the only grain con-
taining sufficient vitamin A to
meet all requirements of the pig.
High in fibre and very palatable,
it is extensively grown in North
America as a pig-food.
“Beroo”: A hard commercial
wax is the latest addition to the
already imposing array of by-
products from sugarcane. A
factory is in operation at
Nambour (Q.) using the mud
from the clarification of the
juices in the Moreton sugar-
mill. Cane wax resembles
camauba wax, which in pre-war
days used to be obtained from
Brazil, and is suitable fen use in
shoe and floor polishes. About
20 tons was produced last year,
and several other sugarmills are
showing an interest.


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

Progress Under Labor
Looking back on the past achievements
of the 90,000-houses, booze-and-betting
N.S.W. Labor Government it is difficult to
single out any legislation other than the
scandalous and unnecessary Night-trotting
Bill. Recently, however, a further sur-
render to gambling interests in the form
of the Midweek-racing Bill was made
just before the Government scurried into
recess until 1950.
Actually none but the racing interests
wanted the bill. There was no demand
from either trade-unions or that portion
of the public which normally supports
Labor, but legislation which might have
been of some value was shelved in order
to placate the masters.
The bill is unsound from the economic
point of view because the majority of
workers now enjoy a five-day week with
plenty of leisure to indulge in gambling
with horse, dog and trotting meetings at
the weekend. Now on Wednesday after-
noons, at a time when increased produc-
tion is vital, work for the majority will be
either virtually suspended or at least
slowed down while operatives pick their
fancies, discuss form with their work-
mates or await the furtive approach of
the shop s.p. man. The result will be
something approaching a week,
with consequent inroads on production
figures. Those who ran factories when
midweek pony-racing was the vogue need
no reminder of the adverse effect on pro-
duction caused by that dead and un-
lamented “sport.”*
The lame rejoinder to this argument—
the assurance that the banning pf broad-
casts will curb such a development—is so
much moonshine. S.p. men throve before
broadcasting came, and while they can
mysteriously acquire two or three tele-
phones at the expense of business folk
who have to wait months for the installa-
tion, the business of accepting bets and
conveyance of details of winners and
prices will present no serious difficulty.
The economic effect of reducing out-
put through s.p. and absenteeism on
Wednesdays apparently was not con-
sidered in this flagrant sell-out to the least
productive and least desirable of our com-
munity, but cynical disregard of public
weal has always been a feature of the
£l5OO-p.a. no-hopers at present misruling
this State.—H. E. (N.S.W.).
Building Costs
Can’t say I agree with “Chips” (B.
9/11/’49) that builders go bankrupt be-
cause of the fierceness of competition. I
have made a close study of the trade,
and am convinced most builders’ financial
troubles are due to lack of capital and a
bad knowledge of estimates.
One builder I know gets his capital by
extracting huge deposits from house-
hungry young couples and using this
money to finance other jobs. His clients
are afraid to go crook as they are in his
hands, and are afraid that if they offend
him he will delay their job even<ionger.
By far the best way to build today is
through a bank which has its own
properly-administered building depart-
ment. Builders can easily put it over
young couples, but not over the banks—
they’re too old in the tooth. — Waddlin’
Willie (Vic.).
“Chips” trots out the familiar winge of
all the building fraternity about the diffi-
culty of obtaining materials, shortage of
labor, blackmarket and the rest of the
sad story. What he says doesn’t alter the
fact that the high cost of building today
is largely due to the inefficiency, lack of
knowledge and desire for quick profits of
many so-called “master builders,”
As for “one price to the builder,
another to the other man,” I per-
sonally know a number of men who,
failing to secure a builder able to under-
take their commission, or wary of the
breed, undertook to build their own
homes. Financed through building
societies, they were required to produce
tenders from sub-contractors and gener-
ally to satisfy the societies that they had
their jobs under control. Sub-contractors,
far from ringing in inflated prices on
them, indicated that they were happy to
undertake the jobs because they knew
their money was certain, which was more
than they could say of some builders.
A man who, according to his letter-’
head, had been a member of the Master
Builders’ Association for 30 years built
my house. For two years I’ve listened to
the greatest tale of woe I ever heard. In
addition I had to arrange delivery of the
tiles, fibrous plaster, bath and basin, be-
sides guaranteeing the plumber payment
of his account before I could get the
plumbing and draining completed and the
gas put on to the place. The place is not
done yet and heaven knows when it will
be finished.
My next-door neighbor was taken for
a ride by two builders whom he later
helped to push through the Bankruptcy
Court. Since then he has done his own
building—organising all his own material
and employing labor. He gets his men
on his job as soon as his materials arrive,
pays them promptly when they finish their
work, and is wondering now why the
blazes he ever fell for a “builder.”
That modern house-construction is a
simple matter requiring little enough skill
except in the technical matters of plumb-
ing, electrical fitting and tiling is evi-
denced by the fact that for years cockies
built their own weatherboard homes in
the bush—homes that today are comfort-
able and sound after many years of use.
With the ready-cut home available even
the modern “builder” should be able to
make a reasonably decent job of home-
building at a reasonable price,— Jindivick
(N.S.W.).
“Chips” is right about it being cheaper
for contractors to sublet work than to
employ artisans at day-labor rates—that
always has been the case. But he can’t
“I will NOT do up your back buttons, sir—let Meadows attend to it.”
get away with the yarn that sub-con-
tractors have a price for the builder and
another for the person who decides to
become his own builder, or that the
builder’s charges are fair and reasonable.
Fixed rates apply to roof-tiles and fix-
ing, and fibrous-plaster. Bricks cost the
builder no less than the owner-builder
has to pay for them. Likewise fibro and
timber. Regarding a regular supply of
bricks, the owner-builder need not be
placed at a disadvantage there, either.
The assertion that the builder acts as
a buffer and protects the owner from ex-
ploitation] is incorrect, and the capital
made of the fact that he orders and pur-
chases materials is much exaggerated.
In the case of a brick house, just what
does the contractor or builder order?
First, bricks, lime, sand, cement, metal
and steel bars. The job is set out, and
the bricky sub-contractor gets to work.
In the meantime floor and roof timbers
have arrived. Bearers and joists are laid
and, when brickwork is completed, the
builder pitches his roof. Then tiling,
electrical, plumbing and plastering sub-
contractors get busy.
The builder then has window and door
openings, floors, etc., to finish before the
painter, another sub-contractor, applies
finishing touches. In fact, the building
has been erected mainly by the sub-con-
tractors.
If the house is timber-framed it is even
more simple. The builder erects the
frame and, except for finishing woodwork,
sub-contractors do the rest, and the
builder is drawing a good wage in the
meantime.
The plant which the builder supplies?
Say four saw-stools, a couple of floor- and
probably a pair of sash-cramps, an ex-
tension- and a stepladder.
All could be bought by the owner-
builder for around £lB and sold at small
loss on completion of job.
As for the builder’s profit being 10
per cent., it’s more like 20 per cent, in
addition to wages drawn, and in many
cases not earned, during operations.
“Chips’s” statement that it is a sellers’
market is irrelevant. The question is, can
an owner-builder save money by eliminat-
ing the builder?
I know from experience that a pros-
pective home-builder who can obtain the
services of a competent carpenter and
pay him, say, £l2 a week to work on and
supervise his job can save at least £3OO
on any house a builder will demand £lBOO
to erect, — Old Carp (N.S.W.).
Railways
What is there about Darwin which so
strongly attracts many Australians —par-
ticularly those who have never been
there?
Why does George Beesley (B. 5/10/’49)
think that connecting Darwin with the
rest of Australia by rail would be a great
asset?
Before the days of air transport such a
scheme may have had some slight justifi-
cation to speed-up overseas mails, but
today it is difficult to see how Australia
is to benefit by the expenditure of many
millions on a railway which would lose
many more millions in maintenance and
operation. The handful of people which
such a line would serve would provide
negligible revenue. The prospect of
passenger traffic developing in competi-
tion with the air is nil.
The only worth-while product of the
Territory is cattle, but the cattle country
is a long way from Darwin. The N.T.
is essentially a cattle-raising, but not a
fattening, area. Most of the stock must
be moved away to where they can be
topped off; mainly to areas near the east
coast of Queensland, from where they
can be sent on to adjacent meatworks for
treatment. Others in suitable seasons
work down the Georgina and other wes-
tern rivers and find their way to southern
markets.
The Victoria and Ord River areas in
the western part of the Territory and in
Westralia can best be served through
Wyndham, where there is already a meat-
works, and a railway could be built there
if justified by the business offering.
A feasible and relatively inexpensive
proposition which would serve much of
the needs of Territory cattle country
would be a railway about 250 miles long
from Mount Isa or Dajarra through the
Barkly Tableland. That would tap a lot
of good country and give access to
Townsville and Bowen, which have the
nearest large processing works to the N.T.
with intervening fattening areas,— Will
S. Pryce (Q.)
Antidote to Communism
Although the Corns have not a great
numerical strength in this country, they
can rely upon a lot of support from dis-
gruntled supporters of Socialism, especi-
ally when, by their militaristic tactics,
they secure conditions of work that the
more moderate unions fail to achieve, or
are very slow in securing. Success natur-
ally brings its admirers, and the aims of
the Commos —especially the aims dished
out for local consumption by Australians
—have considerable appeal for many
people, the great army of “have-nots” in
particular. When a man finds something
to admire in a system, an organisation or
an object, he is part-way won towards it.
In this country the great bulwark
against Communism consists in those
people whom Mr. Dedman once referred
to as “little capitalists.” People who own
their own homes, who possess motor-
cars and have their family circles will
not surrender these to Communism with-
out a long and bitter struggle.
Everyone here should be able
to own his own home. The days
are past when dwellings were a
profitable investment. No more terraces
of houses are being constructed, no
more privately-owned estates of semis
and only a relatively few blocks of flats,
these last unimportant because they
provide no answer to the housing prob-
lem. That leaves only the Government
and the man who is buying his own home
for his own use to look after the housing
needs of the community.
Experience has shown —in N.S.W., at
any rate —that Government-owned hous-
ing does not mean that the blood-sucking
landlord has been replaced by the
benevolent State. Far from it. The
State Housing Commission is not subject
to the restrictions on tenancy, rents
or evictions contained in the Land-
lord and Tenant Act. Rents are levied
at rates much higher than are the pegged
private rents..
Treated as a matter of emergency by
a Government with vision and a practical
outlook, it should be possible to make
housing a No. 1 priority, with all
the resources of the State directed to-
wards providing every family with its
own home. Moreover, it should be pos-
sible to make finance available to home-
builders at rates which would enable
everyone to possess a home at a weekly
cost of not more than the present pegged
rental.
The alternative, at the present rate of
housing progress, is a monopolistic State
landlord—and State monopolies have
proved themselves in days gone by to be
evils greater than anything produced by
private enterprise or capitalism.
Give the “have-nots” their own homes,
make them civic-conscious, prosperous
units in our community, and they will join
with all the other anti-Communist peoples
in the struggle against the Red destroyers.
Revision of Arbitration Court procedure
would provide the answer to the problem
of delays and dissatisfaction with negotia-
tions over working conditions. The
issues are not beyond solution by in-
telligent and informed negotiators. The
fact that many industries have worked
in complete harmony between employer
and employee for years indicates that
the two can come together with accord in
the right atmosphere.— Cave (N.S.W.).
Asia
The White Australia policy can be
convincingly defended, but not on the
ground that colored peoples, as'such, are
lower in the scale of evolution than
Europeans (B. *2/11/’49). Thousands of
years ago, when western and northern
Europeans were hardly more civilised
than were the Maoris when New Zea-
land became British, China, Japan, India
and Persia were centres of high culture.
Centuries earlier still Egypt and Sumeria
developed the world’s first known
civilisations.
Today the opinion advanced a genera-
tion ago by the diffusionists, headed by
Professor Elliot Smith and W. Perry, that
all civilisation derives from Egypt, has
won general acceptance. It was only in
the 18th century that, economically,
Europe began to move much ahead of the
more advanced Asian peoples.
In some parts of the Orient, especially
China and Japan, a highly-skilled agri-
culture has been practised for thousands
of years. China and Japan have also
been noted for a long record of achieve-
ment in the arts, in skilled craftsmanship
and in certain fields of literature.
Cultural appreciation, too, has not
necessarily been confined to a small
aristocratic circle. Laurence Binyon, in
The Spirit of Man in Asian Art, points
out that the patrons of the wonderful
Japanese color-printers of the 18th and
early 19th century —Hiroshige, Hokusai
and the like —were not the social elite but
the equivalent of our lower-middle and
better working classes, Englishmen or
Australians of a similar social stratum in
the 19th century would not have had the
taste to appreciate such works.
That small bodies of Europeans have
managed to secure and maintain control
over Asiatics for long periods doesn’t
prove the white man’s inherent
superiority. The same thing happened
in more than one European country be-
fore nationalism developed. D. A.

North-west Possibilities
Men with money to invest are
turning their eyes towards the
nor’-west of Westralia.
While progress in the last 12
months can hardly be described
as rapid, there are some signs of
advancement of industry in this
525,000 square miles of sparsely-
populated country, over one-and-
a-half times the size of New
South Wales and six times that
of Victoria. The decision of the
Federal .and State Governments
to begin construction of all-
weather roads and stock-routes
in the Kimberleys will give a
fillip to the cattle industry.
During the season just closed
experiments have been carried
out with the air-freighting of
beef from cattle-stations to meat-
works, and so successful has this
been that plans for extensions
are already in hand. The R.S.L.’s
north-west committee has investi-
gated the possibilities of a
1,000,000 - acre beef - industry
settlement near the Fitzroy River
Crossing, which would provide
employment for European and
British migrants. Their report
is favorable.
Two pompanies are drilling
for oil in the area, one of
them, which has already spent
a vast sum of money, expressing
willingness to invest a further
£1,000,000 in the project.
At Point Cloates a private
whaling company took five
whales a day at the height of the
recent season —their first. Work
on the building of a second whal-
ing station at Baggage Island at
the mouth of the Gascoyne
River near Carnarvon, to be con-
trolled by the Commonwealth
Government, has already begun.
At Broome experiments are
under way for growing pine-
apples, and it has already been
proved that the soil around
Carnarvon is suitable for most
tropical fruits. Bananas worth
£232,000 were shipped south last
year. Westralia’s contribution to
the export of crayfish tails
(total 1,370,671) was 1,215,039
for the year ended June 30 last.
These came mainly from waters
to the north of Perth.
The increased interest in pros-
pecting since the rise in the price
of gold will stimulate the search
of the known mineral areas in
the nor’-west. Should other
minerals or oil be found things
will move fast in this erstwhile
forgotten land. Slim Jim
(W.A.).
“Recessional”
A group of English university
students once played a rather
cruel trick on a very dignified
cleric. They inserted a page of
Tom Hood’s punning nonsense
into the book of homilies used
in the pulpit. In due season the
preacher came to the interpolated
passage and unctuously intoned
a considerable portion of the
hilarious rubbish before he woke
up.
A somewhat similar but more
serious prank has been played
on the entire British public by
those responsible for the sing-
ing of Kipling’s masterpiece at
military commemoration services
all over the Empire. Millions
chant it solemnly under the
vague impression that the
sonorous phrases are an injunc-
tion to remember for ever the
achievements and sacrifices of
our heroic dead. On the con-
trary, the immortal hues are a
public confession of the sins of
commission and omission of the
British race throughout its long
history The refrain “Lest We
Forget” refers not to the shining
virtues and dearly - bought
glories, but to our pride of power
and godless reliance on armed
might when dealing with “lesser
breeds.”
In his “Departmental Ditties”
Kipling scourged the faults and
failings of our Empire-builders
with whips of sarcasm. In the
prologue he wrote: “I have told
the tale in jesting guise, but ye
are wise and ye know what the
jest is worth.” In the Reces-
sional he lays aside the motley,
but we are not wise enough to
assess the value of the jeremiad.
Because the verse form lends
itself to a well-known hymn
tune the poem is now put to a
use for which it was never
intended and for which it is quite
unsuiled. — Penitential (S.A.).
Rooms for Migrants
The atmosphere is thick at the
moment with radio appeals to
householders to let their spare
rooms to British migrants who
would like to come to Australia
but cannot find sponsors.
The hoards of European D.Ps.
who are arriving by every ship
are finding living accommoda-
tion somewhere—since they are
not to be found camping on the
steps of the Housing Commis-
sion like the locals frequently
have to, homes must be avail-
able. The Commonwealth Gov-
ernment would do Australia a
service if it expended as much
energy providing housing firstly
for Australians, secondly for
Britishers, as it does for Balts,
Estonians, Lithuanians and
others who hail from similar
places, instead of throwing the
onus of housing our own people
on Australians who possess
homes.
Once a householder takes into
his home any person, migrant
or otherwise, his home ceases to
belong to him —in N.S.W., at
any rate. So long as the stranger
pays his rent each week his
position in the home is stronger
than that of the householder, be-
cause under the N. S, Wales
Landlord and Tenant Act,
1948-49, it is almost impossible
for the latter to turn him out if
the arrangements prove to be un-
satisfactory.
Temperament means a lot in
harmonious and amicable living
relationships, and it is quite pos-
sible that a householder who
took a migrant into his home
would find something irksome
about the arrangements and
would desire to end the tenancy.
He would, however, be unable to
take any action except with the
approval of a magistrate. IP his
case were strong enough—that
the sub-tenant refused to pay his
rent or wrecked the house—he
might get an order against him.
But in the case of the thousand
and one little things that can
happen in a home to make the
place like a hell upon earth,
for a housewife especially, little
can be done. To a magistrate,
for instance, the fact that a per-
son came home regularly under
the influence and with a bottle
on the hip would mean nothing
—thousands of men do the same
each day or each week. But to
a housewife the situation could
be a nightmare.
I know of an instance where
an elderly woman of deep reli-
gious conviction made accom-
modation available in her home
to a young couple and had to
endure every indignity from the
people she had befriended —the
wanton misuse of her home,
noisy drinking parties, desecra-
tion of her sabbath, rudeness
and abuse when she protested.
All her efforts to rid herself of
the annoyance were unsuccess-
ful. Too late she realised that
she had sacrificed her home and
her peace to a merciless system
which regards the “haves” as fair
game for the “have-nots.”
We need migrants, British
migrants above all, but it is fair
and reasonable that our own
people should have protection
against an invasion of their
homes, or at least that they
should be clearly warned of what
they are letting themselves in for
if they respond to the appeal of
the Department of Immigration.
—Jindivick (N.S.W.).
Education
When one regards the general
results of compulsory education
to the age of 16 years one may
wonder why people nowadays
do not show more intellectual
grace and depth.
In Tudor and pre-Tudor times
England probably produced a
greater proportion of famous
intellectual names than at any
period sinceyet formal studies
frequently ceased, in those days,
at 12 or 13.
Does our present system lack
something? Might a change for
the better be noticed if a few
years were given to the study of
logic, rhetoric and elocution? —
A.B.C (N.S.W.).
Inland Killing
An inland killing-centre, as
advocated by “Plain Australian
(B. 2 1 11 1 ’49), has been proved an
outstanding success at Glenroy
abattoir in the Kimberleys
(W.A.). Two experts of the
"Australian Meat Board who in-
spected the Kimberley beef air-
lift scheme have reported to the
board that the meat on arrival at
Wyndham was good, well-set
and without signs of condensa-
tion, The experts were W. E.
Dawson, State representative of
the board in Victoria and an
experienced meat-works tech-
nician, and J. Tierney, em-
ployees’ representative on the
board. In August they paid a
visit of inspection to the Glen-
roy cattle-killing unit on Mt
House station.
In their report to the board
Dawson and Tierney said that,
making due allowances for a
first year’s working, they were
impressed with the degree of effi-
ciency with which the whole of
the operations, including process-
ing, loading and transport, were
carried out.
After slaughtering, the meat
was subject to 18 hours’ chilling
at a return-air temperature of
29 degrees at the start, receding
to 20 degrees on shutting down.
On the day following slaughter
the beef was flown to Wyndham
for storage at the Wyndham
meatworks. The distance from
Glenroy to Wyndham was 190
miles and it was flown in about
li hours. The whole operation
from the Glenroy chiller to the
Wyndham freezer, including
transfer from plane to truck at
the Wyndham aerodrome, took
no longer than three hours.
Grading-out results of the four
days’ kill observed by the ex-
perts, mostly of younger bul-
locks, gave 57.2 per cent, first
grade, 31.8 per cent, second
grade, 5.4 per cent, third grade
and 5.6 per cent, rejects. The
Glenroy works are conducted by
Air Beef (W.A.) Pty., Ltd., and
the project was initiated by local
cattle-raisers, assisted by a loan
from the State Government and
with the co-operation of Mac-
Robertson-MiUer Aviation Co.
This air-lift is a pioneer enter-
prise, and if it turned out to be
successful the development of
the idea might have a significant
bearing on the future of the
cattle industry of Northern Aus-
tralia. Success depends on
elimination of losses caused by
droving over long distances.
So far the average weight of
the bullocks slaughtered and
treated at the abattoir at Glen-
roy and flown the 190 miles
north to Wyndham has been
more than 6571 b. The average
weight of cattle droved to the
Wyndham meatworks in the
last decade has been 5501 b.. The
top weight so far has been
10301 b. On each of three flights
a day 90001 b of meat is carried.
Air-transport authorities did
not regard the system as likely
to prove economic, under present
conditions, where transport for
distances over 300 miles was
involved North Wester

bailiff left him after getting him
to sign a paper of still another
shape and color. The old Joey
seemed to think that now Marks
might just as well go and cut his
throat.
In between bailiffs and break-
downs they gradually got the hay
cut. Marks did not go to town
when new parts had to be pro-
cured, but sent the enginedriver.
However, there always seemed
to be momentous news for him,
and we were not really surprised
when we saw two large police-
men arrive. But Marks had not
been at the cutter all that day,
and the teamster’s guess was that
“Cedric , who ARE these creatures P”
he was “in the dead centre of
your father’s big scrub paddock.”
The day came when the last
stock was chopped into chaff,
and the men began packing up
and hooking all the parts of the
outfit into a train again.
“He’s going to make a run for
it now,” the sour teamster said.
That rather amused us, be-
cause the traction engine
travelled at about two miles per
hour and the big wheels left
tracks two feet wide wherever
they went.
Then suddenly a car came tear-
ing down the road and across
our paddock. Some of the men
said it was the bailiff and some
said the police, and all of them
were right; the two severe and
outraged meii were there, too.
This time, we could see, there
was going to be no nonsense,
but we were hardly prepared for
what they did. The bailiff read
out a paper .which left Marks
quite speechless, and then while
the police stood each side of
Marks, the severe-looking men
put marks and seals all over the
engine, cutter, steamer, galley and
the Furphy.
The teamster came over and
told us gloatingly that they were
seizing the plant for debt.
When it was all done they
waited there for Marks to leave,
but he didn’t seem to realise that
there was nothing for him to do
but go away empty-handed.
Finally he got into his old car
with the enginedriver and as
many of the gang as could pile
in with him and drove off. The
severe-looking .men were sud-
denly desolated that they had
omitted £o seize the car.
HE chaffcutting plant stood
there for a long time. Now
and then hopeful-looking bar-
gain-hunters came to inspect it,
but none of them bought it.
Father was always most dis-
couraging when they asked his
opinion of it. Of course he was
all for law and order, but he
thought it was the ultimate out-
rage to “deprive a man of his
living,”
The time came round to
plough the “Long Two-hundred
Acre” again, and we had to leave
nearly an acre where the plant
was standing. No more chaff-
cutting contractors came to
look at it, but the scrap-
iron merchants began to
take lan interest. Father .told
them we didn’t know who owned
the plant now, trying to make
things difficult for them; but
when they hinted that they’d give
him a fiver and say nothing, he
was so indignant that we saw no
more of scrap-iron merchants,
Then after the next harvest
w hen we, and many of our
neighbors, were away on holi-
days at the coast, the plant dis-
appeared. There was a heavy
pain before we returned and we
couldn’t see any tracks. Father’s
explanation to everyone who
commented on the disappearance
of our landmark was;

F
NOAH AGAIN
By “COL M.”
THERE was a story a few
years back concerning a
racehorse Queen of the
Fairies who was shipped by
air between two Australian
capitals. She disliked the look
of the plane when she first saw
it and kicked out wildly until
someone quietened her with a
quart of whisky and a bucket of
water for a chaser. The horse
was then lost to the public for
some hours until a paper, at
her port of destination, an-
nounced that she had arrived,
adding the note —short,, but a
veritable arsenal for the Tem-
perance people—that she had
a bleeding nose.
Since then the movement of
animals by air has become an
industry. The people of Singa-
pore have been providing a ready
market for Australian dogs, of
any description; it has been ex-
plained that they are great dog-
lovers who unfortunately had to
eat the ones they had during
the Occupation.
Dogs and horses are now
apparently child’s-play to move
by air, other animals not so
simple, and the controllers of
8.0.A.C., finding more and
more animals on the cargo-lists,
have published a volume on the
caring for, and the habits of, any
brand of fauna its staff is likely
to come across.
The crates and cages used
seem a science in themselves.
They are tailored to measure and
must not be square, but oblong,
so that in rough flying the in-
mate may brace himself against
the walls and not be tossed
about.
Certain enterprising animals,
need sheet-iron linings in their
cages, a job for skilled artisans,
“As,” the book says, “a loose
corner or turned-up edge may
lead to the undoing of the whole
structure in the hands of a perse-
vering bear,”
Remarkable as it may seem,
monkeys airborne are shy. Their
box should be placed in com-
parative darkness and they prefer
to huddle together. The anthro-
poid ape, however, likes to wrap
himself up in a blanket, and if,
on his journey, he cannot have
the companionship of others of
his kind, human beings are
apparently the next-best thing,
and by them the ape must be
amused and kept happy, as
otherwise he will have a ten-
dency to weep. • While most
animals are said to prefer this
same soft darkness as the monks,
the book emphasises how regret-
table it would be to carry birds
over distances in anything but
bright light, for birds, by habit,
cease to eat at sunset, and they
could actually be tricked into
starvation.
Zebras and animals with horns
are given the protection of
crates lined a foot thick with
padding ; mice, wombats and all
things that gnaw are sheathed in
tin.
In the chapter on game-birds
it is stated that since pheasants
and the like are apt to jump up
and injure their heads, their
roofing calls for springy canvas.
Large frogs, by the way, are also
liable to such injury, so similar
measures must be taken, and it
should be remembered that toads
travel best when surrounded by
damp blotting-paper.
The keeper will find in his
handbook a section on menus,
and must feed his gorillas three
times a day on bread and butter
with jam or honey, fruit and
green vegetables, and a spot of
cake when, like Pooh Bear, they
feel “eleven-o’clockish.” The
lions and tigers once a day are
due for Hlb. of raw meat for
every 301 b. they weigh; assum-
ing they’ve had a good meal
before embarking, crocodiles
will sleep for a week, but should
be wakened, taken without, and
watered daily with a hose.
Australia’s coat-of-arms comes
into it indirectly when, in the
chapter on what to do when the
animals escape, the book warns
that kangaroos may kick at one’s
stomach, and emus peck one’s
eyes.
Assume now that you are
flying along with this valuable
volume in' your shirt-front and
look round from the controls to
see that the polar-bear in A-3 is
lifting his hind-leg from his box,
while the fully-grown African
lion in G-4 is loose and holding
his stomach with a paw and
looking as if he disagrees with
the sufficiency of the diet laid
down in 8.0.A.C.’s book; not
only this, but the seals are flap-
ping about on the floor, while
the fox is running to ground pur-
sued by a crateful of escaped
monkeys. What do you do?
Well, says the book, “You
must show calmness and deter-
mination.” According to this
Hoyle, the larger beasts should
creep away at your approach
into dark corners and remain
there indefinitely. That would
settle your bear and lion. You
then capture the seals individu-
ally by grasping them by the
back-flippers, “taking care that
their heads cannot reach one’s
legs or feet.” The monkeys are
picked up by the back of the
neck and dropped, with a scold-
ing, into their box, and the fox,
correctly held by the tail and
at arm’s length, is put in his
place.
That’s that, and thankful to
the ex-Poona man who must
have written the interesting
volume for 8.0.A.C., you tuck
it into your shirt again, return
to your controls, and fly on into
the wide blue yonder. Or so
they say.


moonlight above the decaying Chinese
gambling-hell in Queensland —
Old Tim turns and old Sam, groans,
“God be good to my breaking bones”;
and in the slack of tideless night
the tree breathes honey and moonlight—
the Australian scene has not been pre-
sented by any poet more richly than this,
and seldom as sensitively. It is the
authentic voice of the Australian earth ;
and even where that earth is soaked with
tragic history or charred with bushfire it
is excitingly alive.
It would be unreasonable to ask from
a second or any subsequent book
more than this combination of technical
assurance, Australian warmth and depth
of spirit; and as far as the present
reviewer is concerned Judith Wright could
go on writing poems like “The Bull”
and “Wonga Vine” and “Night After
Bushfire” till, as they say, the cows come
home , . . which, very likely, they will,
in one of these Australian landscapes.
But Woman to Man is not as strong in
its specifically Australian poems as was
The Moving Image ; there has been a
change of directioh away from the sun-
light to the night, away from landscape
to a dark world of the spirit, away from
the traditional Australia of “Bullocky”
to a region beyond time where
following, you cling on the last ledge
over the unthinkable, unfathomed edge
beyond which man remembers only death.
Or, more correctly, while the Australian
world that was in The Moving Image is
extended into the new book but not sub-
stantially developed, the darkness that
lay in The Moving Image and against
which the bullocky set his campfire has
been enormously expanded and developed
till it overshadows the whole.
With the title-poem “Woman to Man”
on the opening page the book moves
into midnight:
The eyeless labourer in the night,
the selfless, shapeless seed I hold,
builds for its resurrection day—
silent and swift and deep from sight
foresees the unimagined light.
This is no child with a child’s face;
this has no name to name it by:
yet you and I have known it well.
This is our hunter and our chase,
the third who lay in our embrace —
and there, in a midnight which represents
the darkness where the unborn child
takes shape, and “pain the fierce darkness
thrusting at all life,” and the darkness
before the creation of the world in which
the cycads sink their roots, and the dark-
ness of death, and the darkness of not-
being in which the unborn embryo, dead
at the beginning of its life-cycle, endures
its blind existence, and the darkness of
the sleeping city where “lover, brother,
murderer still are one,” and the dark-
ness into which the human spirit climbs
in' the mystery of love —there in that mid-
night at once creative and destructive,
the primal midnight of the universe, life
and death wrestle in the book until at
the end, through the mouth of a blind
singer, the poet is able to say;
I have laid my ear to the dust, and the
thing it said
was Silence. Therefore I have made silence
speak; I found
for the night a sound.
It is a black enough territory; and
familiar, seen through other eyes, in con-
temporary poetry since the two World
Wars, and the fear of the collapse of
European civilisation and the influence
of T. S. Eliot set so many writers
digging up bones and question-
ing the universe. But it is not in this
book a country of despair. And out of
it, by writing frankly and courageously
as a woman in a way that was hardly
possible to Elizabeth Browning or Chris-
tina Rossetti, Judith Wright brings the
tender “Woman’s Song” and a love-lyric,
“Night,” of very great beauty:
Standing here in the night
we are turned to a great tree,
every leaf a star,
its root eternity—
and the astonishing dramatic lyric en-
titled “The Unborn” with its desperate
question that the dead and the living as
well as the unborn might ask; —■
Not even tears were mine,
not even death;
not even the dazzling pain
of one first breath.
I never knew the sleep
of the warm womb.
The end of my beginning
was dumb; was dumb.
Only the foot of the stair
I felt, being blind.
Then came the touch of fear
time now can never mend.
My name was a dark sound
that made no word.
Terror alone spoke it
and nothing heard.
Neither awake nor asleep
on the rack of dark I lie,
hearing my own not-voice,
“What was I? I? I?”
This, then, is what Judith Wright has
done in her second book. Technically,
except in some long poems which lack
the compactness and rhythmical energy
of the title-poem in the first, it is equal to
The Moving Image, and it could hardly
hope to surpass it; in the Australian
landscapes, though they do not dominate
the book and though they do not quite
create the legendary effect of “Bullocky”
and “South of My Days,” the quality is
maintained ; and in the lyrics of mid-
night, though naturally there is less color,
there is a tragic intensity surpassing any-
thing she has previously written.

Hollywood Columbus.
Although Mario Ghisalberti’s 768-page
Christopher Columbus; A Romance
(Heinemann), translated by Lady Trou-
bridge from the Italian of L’Oro E La
Croce, is almost twice as long as Salva-
dor Madariaga’s biography, reviewed
recently on the Red Page, its best value
is in showing what a superb bit of writ-
ing Madariaga’s book is.
If, as the Ghisalberti cover says, “every
point mentioned is scrupulously based
on a known fact,” the least that can be
said is that the known facts are not
adduced.
In the Journal of Columbus himself,
for instance, there is only casual men-
tion of the ship’s company wanting to
go back during the first voyage.
Madariaga, on cited authority, fans this
into a “conspiracy bordering on mutiny,”
which Columbus met undecidedly, re-
ferring it to Pinzon, who bluntly advised
him to hang a few objectors or throw
them overboard, and that quick and
downright reply quelled the mutiny.
But Ghisalberti gives the insurrection
the whole works, with Columbus, a mix-
ture of Errol Flynn and Abraham Lin-
coln, stalking in and out of his cabin
and exercising compulsive personality,
while one of the Pinzons sides with
Columbus and the other with the muti-
neers. Much early writing embroiders
the fine bare statements of the Columbus
journal, and presumably whatever he can
find in writing is for Signor Ghisalberti
a “known fact.”
There are many more scenes which are
less historical events than Ghisalbertian
situations. Columbus is shown fleeing by
sea from the assassins of the King of
Portugal with his wife and son Diego,
the wife dying of pneumonia in a seaside
pub in Spain; whereas the best evidence
that a scholar like Madariaga can pro-
duce is that the wife died before Colum-
bus left Portugal, and that Columbus
cleared out of Portugal with his son only,
fearful, not so much of the king’s evil
intentions, as of being discovered with
the letter of Toscanelli the astronomer,
which set him on the track of the new
world, and which he had stolen from the
King of Portugal.
Then there is Beatriz Enriquez,
Spanish mistress of Columbus. Madariaga
carefully details eight facts that are
known of her, chiefly, that she was a
“Cordoban woman,” that she bore a son
to Columbus on August 15, 1488, that
Columbus was fond of her, mysteriously
obliged to her, settled the prize for dis-
covering America upon her, bade his two
sons to care for her, and did not marry
her. Madariaga adds, as theory only,
that she was a Jewess, of the Torquemada
converse family, and quotes Las Casas
on the death of the Portuguese wife:
“....it was meet that he should be un-
encumbered of the care and obligation of a
. wife for a business in which God was to
occupy him all his life.”
From this Madariaga merely conjec-
tures that the explanation of his not
marrying again was that “he was, above
all, to be free to discover his world.”
But what are Ghisalberti’s “known
facts”? That she was the niece of
Columbus’s landlady; that Columbus
could not marry her because he had
promised his dying wife in the seaside
pub that he would not marry again;
that on discovering the liaison her aunt
kicked them both out; that they tramped
the countryside to her brother’s home
and hurt their feet.
For Ghisalberti the Portuguese
marriage was a beautiful love-affair ; but
for the diplomat Madariaga it was also
the move of a great man, but crafty, to
get into a rich seafaring family that
could advance his interests. For Ghisal-
berti, Martin Pinzon was a calculating
scoundrel; but Madariaga shows him to
have been a rich, bluff shipowner who
not only helped to finance Columbus and
organise his fleet, but also had had simi-
lar plans; moreover, that if there were
any mistrust between Pinzon and Colum-
bus it was caused in the first place by
the manoeuvres of Columbus to edge the
Pinzons out of the enterprise.
Which is merely to say that Signor
Ghisalberti has written what the title-
page calls it, “A Romance,” rather than
a history; but even with the aid of fic-
tion he has been unable to produce the
portrait of Columbus which Madariaga
gave us in his biography. Everything
has been ironed-out flat, like the Holly-
wood clothes of Frederic March as
Columbus on the cover: thus the novelist
is as dull as a conventional historian,
while the biographer shows us a many-
sided genius with something of the ex-
citement and vividity of Dumas.
Reviewed Briefly.
Money’s Worth of Murder: Clive
Conrad (Museum Press). A charming
English heiress in fear of murder co-opts
a pleasant young accountant to act as her
husband; when they are not foiling in-
credible villains they are getting into
compromising situations in nightgowns
and pyjamas, to a reassuring accompani-
ment of distant wedding-bells and Chris-
topher Robin saying his prayers.

Modern English Drama: Ernest Rey-
nolds (Harrap). A survey of the theatre
from 1900—professional and little
theatres, architecture and decoration and,
principally, the plays that have been per-
formed Flecker, Drinkwater, Yeats,
Synge, Shaw, Galsworthy, Bottomley,
Priestley, Bridie, Coward, Eliot, Auden,
Duncan. Mr. Reynolds’s criticism does
not run very deep, but the book is useful
as a survey.
Ceramics for the Collector: Georee
Savage (Rockliff). Mr. Savage collects
pots, sells pots and here writes about
pots with authority and with love rang-
ing from neolithic pots to Chinese pots
to French, Italian and Spanish pots, to
English pots of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries. It contains in a pot
as it were, all the collector wants to
know about pottery, and, since the Col-
lectors’ Book Club made it a Book of
the Month, Mr. Savage may make pots
out of it.

Dents are reprinting in 12 volumes
their Everyman’s Encyclopcedia, which
will contain over 50,000 articles. About
a fifth of the work is entirely new, and
all the rest has been revised and brought
up to date. World War II and the Atomic
Age will be covered. Four volumes to
hand—among which the present reviewer
is particularly fond of the title Balano-
glossus to Bui ford —take one as far as
Coalfish to Drama; two more volumes
will be published in February and the
rest of the series at the rate of two
volumes every two months.

Reading a Novel: Walter Allen
(Phoenix House). An amiable little book
designed to interest the general reader
in five books now acclaimed by what Mr.
Allen calls “the passionate few”— The
Power and the Glory by Grahame
Greene, Between the Acts, by Virginia
Woolf, Goodbye to Berlin by Christopher
Isherwood, The Horse’s Mouth by Joyce
Cary and A Woman of the Pharisees by
Francois Mauriac,

Men in the Tropics: Harold Evans
(Hodge). An out-of-the-way anthology
made up from the journals and travel-
books of men who went out of the way
to make the British Empire. The short
extracts, though linked with a line or
two of commentary, make rather dis-
jointed reading, but the book, covering
the earth and the seas from West Africa
to the Pacific Islands, is certainly filled
with interesting information. From
Cooper’s Coral Lands (1880), for in-
stance, “On another occasion Mr. Hard-
ing asked his cannibal acquaintances why
they used forks for human flesh only.
They replied that human flesh when
cooked emitted in the dark a peculiar
halo which resembles a phosphorescent
lustre or magnetic flame being much
afraid of. this they used the well-known
[wooden] cannibal forks.”

The Healing Touch: Harley Williams
(Cape). The advance of the healing art
from William Knighton, physician to
George 111, to the Mayo Clinic and
Cushing the Baltimore brain surgeon. An
exceptionally well-written book, full of
life and wit and color; not only a
“doctor’s book,” but a set of excellent
compact biographies of such people as
Florence Nightingale and Brown-Sdquard,
whom the author calls “The Ulysses of
Biology.”
* * * *
Buffers End: Emett of “Punch”
(Faber). Emett, who draws the demented
locomotives, should need no introduc-
tion ; his work has been so popular in
“Punch,” as a kind of relief through
hysteria from an age of mechanisation and
standardisation, that this is the fifth
selection to be published in book form.
A drawing of some topical interest for
Australia bears the caption, “So that’s
what they meant when they said they
would meet us half-way over the petrol!”
—it shows a man and his wife in a dilapi-
dated car, obviously off for the week-
end, being met half-way on their journey
by two housemaids and the proprietress
of a guesthouse, who have harnessed
themselves to the car with a tow-rope.
