The Real Stevenson
Not many readers ui Stevenson, it paay be,
have thought they have discovered in those
little-regarded fairy stories, “The Bottle
Imp” and “The Waif Woman,” a revelation
of the secret of their author’s life. But that
is what George S. Hellmann lias done and
explained with ingenuity in his book, The
True Stevenson, which he sub-titles “A Study
in Clarification.” Hellmann is a great
student of Stevenson’s life and writings, and
has been responsible for the publication by
the Bibliophile Society of Boston of several
volumes of hitherto unchronicled MSS.,
mostly poetry.
After Mrs. Stevenson’s death in 1914 her
daughter, Isobel Strong, sold at auction a
mass of personalia which her mother had
kept from the knowledge of the world and
even of Stevenson’s collaborator, her son,
Lloyd Osbourne. Most of this material
Hellmann bought, and on it (over 100 poems,
letters, and other MSS.) he bases his work
of clarification and explodes what he calls
“the Stevenson myth.” This myth, shortly,
is that Stevenson was the type of man
possessing all those virtues generally held up
for the emulation of youth. He adds that
Stevenson himself never contributed to this
picture of the virtues, but that his wife and
his biographers have deliberately built it up
and kept a veil of suppression over it all
these years. The process of clarification
by Hellmann is far more ruthless than that
by J. A. Steuart, and at last, it would seem,
avc have as much in print as can at present
be published. Stevenson emerges from the
pages less the saint we used to read of
Avhen schoolboys, but more the man, whose
ever-present standard of behavior Was
noblesse oblige. Hellmann deduces, from an
examination of the two “cue” stories and
from unpublished letters of Stevenson’s, that
his married life had been dearly paid for, in
its departure from the artist ideals, in broken
friendships (Henley and others) and intel-
lectual compromise. In justification, lie
analyses “The Bottle Imp” and “The Waif
Woman,” and from them satisfies himself
that, under the guise of fiction, the harassed
Stevenson decided to give the world a chance
to learn the truth.
In the theme and setting of “The Waif
Woman” there are departures from the actual
episodes that provided the general idea. The
northern reef takes the place of the Samoan
island ; the lusted-after chests of fine raiment
are symbolical of worldly possessions. One
is moved to agree with Hellmann that the
story is essentially biographical, and that it
Avas for that reason Mrs. Stevenson pro-
tested against its publication. The theme of
“The Bottle Imp” seems to appear in various
aspects in European folklore—the mediaeval
legend of the man who risks eternal damna-
tion for the sake of worldly success. Steven-
son'wrote to Conan Doyle about the story,
saying it was “an indiscreet piece of writing.”
Very indiscreet, and a “cue” with a double
meaning, if we may agree with Hellmann’s
reading of its history. A little-known story
by Henry James is referred to, “The Author
of Beltraffio,” in support of a story knoAvn
to Sidney Colvin and others, but carefully
kept out of print, that Mrs. Stevenson had
burned a MS. novel dealing with the life
of a harlot because its publication would
interfere with the Myth and the accompany-
ing royalties. James’s story is a dramatic
treatment of this incident, which had been
related to Mm by Edmund Gosse. New light
is thrown on Stevenson’s relations with Mrs.
Sitwell, to whom he wrote at least two
beautiful poems and whose correspondence
Avith him was recently published. It would
seem to have been in a fit of despair on
learning that Mrs. Sitwell preferred Mr.
Colvin to himself that Stevenson embarked
on that inland voyage. It is quite plain
that Mrs. Sitwell was his chief vitalising
influence, and not his Avife, great as her
services were to him afterwards. In one
of his letters SteA-enson described himself
bitterly as the goose, that laid the golden
egg; in another he says, “A man may pay
too dearly for his livelihood by bartering
for it the whole of his available liberty and
becoming a slave till death.” Other facts
there are which I am not going to take it
on myself to repeat here; they all go to
prove that Hellmann has done a service and
homage to Stevenson like that done by
Blamire Young for Goya. Sir Sidney Col-
vin’s position as editor of the letters suffers
badly, Heilman states baldly that Colvin’s
editing was a compromise unworthy of any
scholar, despite the acknowledged difficulties
(mainly due to Mrs. Stevenson and Lloyd
Osbourne) Avhich ,he worked under, and
facsimile letters and quotations are pre-
sented to shoAV that he altered phrases in
Stevenson’s letters quite unnecessarily and
Avas swayed by private motives from men-
tioning facts in Stevenson’s life which were
vital to a truthful delineation of his
character. Graham Balfour’s biography is
described very aptly as a readable account
of a family kind which offends no one and
hides everything.
Summing up, Hellmann stresses that it
is less in the matter of courage in bad health
that Stevenson deserves praise than for the
depth and intensify of liis unselfish struggle
in the arena of the spirit and the intellect.
Incidentally, he refers to that letter of
Stevenson’s in winch he describes, “with the
interest of the artist and the predilections
of the sensualist,” the beautiful figure of
one of his Samoan girls as she bends over
the fireplace.. That is a picture which has
something magical in it, to my mind. It
helps to balance the other Stevenson, him
of the Myth, who Avrote prayers and taught
Sunday-school, in the same way as that little
picture of Frank Harris hurling a spittoon
at someone in a London bar is equally valu-
able in any consideration of that other Harris
who bids us turn our eyes these days to
Jesus for light.
CAMDEN MORRISBY.
The Showing-up of Walt Whitman?
When the statement is made (R.P.
28/10/’26) that Walt Whitman, after all,
was'no, poet, but-a humbug, one receives the
impression that the writer, L. Phillips, in-
tends to take the reader’s breath away. The
reader, however, remains . calm, for such
statements have been made before. It is ex-
tremely easy to point out that Whitman is
often dull, often uncertain, never quite be-
yond the range of possible bathos, and there-
fore ready to provide,you with unexpected
and ill-timed amusement. All these faults,
though, are so obvious at the first glance
that it takes no great daring to allude to
them. Anyone who is going to enjoy the
essential Whitman has to admit that first he
must encounter these lions on the path.
Well, these lions have often been met, and
often conquered. L. Phillips wonders how
the Rossettis and their friends allowed
themselves to be hoodwinked by Whitman.
One can only say that the Rossettis would
be at least as sensitive to Whitman’s painful
barbarisms as L. Phillips or the rest of us.
They simply agreed, however, to go further
on: the lions were not the whole matter.
W. M. Rossetti, in his remarkable anthology
of American poetry, included some of Whit-
man’s most permanent and personal work,
and nobody has since been able to show
cause why those poems should not be in-
cluded. The unevenness of Whitman's
powers has always been admitted and has
recently been analysed over again in a care-
ful volume by John Bailey, in the new Eng-
lish Men of Letters Seriesj Bringing to his
task almost an overdose of caution, almost
too many apologetic “buts” and “ifs,” John
Bailey emerges with the profoundest faith
in the man’s genius and gives continuous
and striking illustrations of it. Perhaps the
finest of all Whitman’s less known poems is
the one called “On the Beach at Night. ’
It is too long to quote here, in all its grace
and intensity—qualities wholly denied to
the author by those who see only liis cata-
logues and duluess. The theme is simple. A
child, holding her father’s hand on the beach,
weeps because she sees black clouds covering
all the stars. Her father comforts her, com-
forting himself: —
Jupiter shall emerge, be patient; watch again another
night, the Pleiades shall emerge....
The vast immortal suns and the long-enduring pensive
motms shall again shine.
Thou dearest child, mournest thou only for Jupiter?
Considerest thou alone the burial of the stars?....'
Something there is more immortal even than the
stars
(Many the burials, many the days' and nights passing
away).
Something that shall endure longer even than lustrous
Jupiter,
Or the radiant sister the Pleiades,
As John Bailey says, in quoting the poem
whole, wdiat a last line !
Whitman’s reputation has suffered,through
many accidents. More than most poets, lie
needs to be' read in a well-chosen selection,
one chosen by an admirer who had something
in the nature of a divining-rod. Instead of
this, he has been published in rambling, in-
discriminate volumes. Moreover, bis personal
power, when alive, as a kind of inspired seer,
led to a belief in what theologians call the
“literal inspiration” of his work, so that
his very faults were marked out as for
praise. Like Tolstoi, he suffered from the.
advocacy of his over-earnest and narrowly-
moral disciples. As a corrective, John Bailey’s
study is worth reading carefully. You have
the feeling that if this sagacious and even
unwilling reader can let himself be drawn
into the circle of the very thralls of Whit-
man, then Whitman cannot be disposed of
by a list of his most obvious faults. And
when Swinburne surrendered to the same
power 60 years ago, lie was not, as L.
Phillips suggests, forced to the surrender by
his friends: lie remained in this matter a,
proud and sensitive critic, and Whitman
remained a rare and powerful poet.
As Young Australia Writes
Between the ages of nine and twelve
children are unconscious mimics of all
around them. Boys will imitate the very
strut of their favorite football star. Girls
will quickly mimic the carriage and manner-
isms of some fashionable stage-lady. I have
even noticed boys all unconsciously limping
like a beloved teacher. So completely are
they unconcerned about it that children to
whom I have pointed out the fact of their
mimicry have been startled almost into
shame.
But it is in speech that children of this
period are the most imitative; and this
imitation becomes so habitual and so per-
sistent that even to-day Bendigo children
use the old Cornish “Where’s he to?” If
the common speech of adults is good, the
children’s speech will also be good. But is
it always understood that as adults speak, so
children write? I think there, could be no
better test of Australian speech than to com-
pare and classify the errors to be found in
one thousand children’s “Compositions.”
To-day I corrected nearly 100 essays writ-
ten by children whose average age was 10
years, and as I flung down my red-ink pen
I felt that “D.M.W.,” in his dissertation
on Australian Speech (R.P. 28/10/’26),
was rather generous when he contended that
five or six per cent, of our population “speak
pretty decent English.” As I have often
found before, the following mistakes were
common
You was,... We was There was birds....
We have went. .. . Would ot went. ... We seen.,. .
There [for “they are - ’] ... .Your [for “you are’’].
And adjectives were nearly always used in
place of adverbs, which with the examples
“there” and “your” above, shows how we
Australians tend to clip our words. The
use of “seen” for “saw” is so common that
one little girl wrote “We saw,” and then
corrected it to read “We seen.” The use
of “of” for “have” in compound verbs begin-
ning with “would,” “should” and “had” is
becoming more pronounced every year—
simply because we really say “of” in such
connections, giving it a clipped sound that
can only be denoted by the letter “v.”
“D.M.W.” is afraid “ugly pronunciation
may become the rule.” I am certain that

COUNTRY FED.
Women and Novels
W. M. Fleming’s diatribe against the
modern novel (R.l‘. 21/10/’26) reads like
the croakings of one who refuses to move
with the times. His “terrible indictment of
the women of to-day” indicts no one save
the frothy irresponsibles who have ever been
a feature of society in any age, and displays
a complete ignorance of what women really
like to read. As to women’s demand for
such books showing us where we are —well,
where are we? He indicates that we are on
the road to ruin—as we’ve ever been. But
we are saner, healthier and harder-working
than we used to be, so some progress must
be admitted. Manners change with the
times, forward or backward, but the forward
movement for many generations has always
been greater than the backward; and in
this probably backward period we are not
as bad as we were the last time reformers
wagged a finger at us.
In the pleasant suburb from whose library
I procure two books and several magazines
per week I have made count of 26 women
acquaintances who read as much as I do —
bank clerks, typists, wives of professional
men, widows of small means, and so on, all
shingled, short-skirted and modern ; and not
one of us has read the three recent books
so severely condemned by Mr. Fleming. We
vote them stupid or silly, and prefer Olivia
Douglas and real stories. And Mr. Fleming
quite forgot to allude to the many delightful
and popular novels contemporary with the
strictured three.
As for historical novels, which it is said
to our discredit we don’t read, they are the
dullest things in the world if they are the
kind which are served out to children ; and
if they are true they present life as
chequered and shady as the worst of to-day’s
best-sellers. Murder, treachery, immorality,
thieving and swindling shed a lurid light
over the many dark pages of the histories
of all nations, so I cannot see that we are
much better served by this type of novel,
which is often only a travesty of the reliable
history books always at hand when facts
are required.
Only a man could assert that sex is the
greatest thing in life—and only a man who
can never hope to understand women. There
are many much greater things in the lives
of women. Even the ploughboys who fore-
gathered on Sunday afternoons in “Carrotty
Broon” were hazily aware of this, and dis-
cussed it; and it is the authors who have
realised it fully who have given us our
immortal novels.
ELIZA.
The Haggis Muse
It was bound to come. The back-drawn
tides of Scandinavian and Russian literary
cults have long stranded their argonauts high
and dry, in both senses of either word. The
glutinous dews of the iCeltic comeback, drop-
ping from the wings of the morning to where
crickets innumerable vied with each other
in singing them, left most of us sweeter, if
not saner. The deafening exhaust of the
neo-Georgian machine is already a receding
mutter in the distance; and the unearthly
music of the Sitwells —horns of Bedlam loudly
blowing—has attuned the ear to whatever
might be crouching in wait. Something of
the sort lias leapt upon us now out of the
darkness. On an earth hitherto unheeding
the story of its birth lias burst the Scottish
Literary Renaissance. Its herald appears in
the person of one Lewis Spence. In a recent
number of the Nineteenth Century he
shouted that the old deities are dead in Scot-
land, as in Olympia or Parnassus. Tanna-
liill, Scott, Drummond, Hogg and many an-
other —even Burns, though that saying reeks
of blasphemy on a Scottish lip—have been
cast down into the limbo of the false pro-
phets. In their place glows a new and efful-
gent galaxy of gods, aureoled with the new
spirit of Scotland —-the ribald will, perhaps,
forbear the obvious allusion —and already
accepted as guiding pillars of fire for Cale-
donian writers yet to come.
There can be no doubt about it, either.
Mr. Spence is himself young, a Scot, and
a member of the rising constellation, fitted,
therefore, at all points, to dogmatise. Though
several of this new hierarchy of the Haggis
are fine, there is one in especial whom Mr.
Spence extols as the ewe lamb of his flock.
It is C. M. Grieve, of Montrose, who in the
evangel’s words, “lias created a Kulturkarnjif
in Scottish literary circles-, framed a school
of Scottish poetry, and formulated a work-
ing theory of Scottish letters.” Further,
though not exactly in Mr. Spence’s words,
Mr. Grieve has sunk a dirty left into the
midriff of the Kailyard School’s crass senti-
mentality, and k.o’d the even grosser cari-
catures of Harry Lauder. Nevertheless, the
young literary Hercules has been modest
enough to conceal his personality, till re-
cently, under the non-de-bagpipe of “Hugh
McDiarmid.” In his lately-published volume
of verse, “Sangschaw,” we have his extol-
ler’s word for it that he has “returned to
the native Doric,” and even “recaptured the
spirit of ‘Wallie Wastle’ and ‘Leery, Leery,
Licht the Lamps’,” a statement which even
the ranks of Tuscany will probably forbear
to challenge rashly.
Mr. Spence does not give us many
examples of his nightingale’s song. What
is set down, however, seems quite worthy
of the new movement. If it be correct that
a soul-kinship with Nature be a true test
of a poet—one has the “Nightingale” of
Keats in mind —it may be worth while to
quote a specimen of “Hugh McDiarmid” in
this vein. It is brief, to the point and is
entitled :
THE GORLIN.
Gape, Gape, Gorlin,
For I hae a worm
That’ll gie ye a slee and sliggy sang,
Wi’ mony a whuram.
That is all-sufficient; static. Compare it
with the fatuities of Burns’s “Fieldmouse
or Scott’s platitudinous attempt:—
The herring lo’es the merry moonlight,
The mackerel io’es the wind,
But the oyster lo’es the dredging song,
For he comes o’ a gentle kind,
and smile sardonically at the old-time wor-
ship of false idols. .
Then there is the apostrophic vein which
Scott has attempted to strike in “O Cale-
donia, stern and wild.” Well enough, no
doubt, but does it carry the message ot this.:
THE BONNIE BROUKIT BAIRN.
Mars is braw in Crammosy;
Venus in a green silk goon;
The auld Moon shakes her gowden feathers;
Their starry talks a wheen o’ blethers,
Nane for thee a thochtie speerin’,
Earth, thou bonnie, broukit bairn!
That is a picture which, apart from its
tonality and color motif, must carry a mes-
sage of profoundest conviction to the heart
of the most unheeding; must cause even
Pliilistia to give ear.
It is, however, in ‘‘The Wattergaw that
the highest note is reached. Bike all his
outpourings, it is brief, necessarily, since
no genius could endure the strain of such
inspiration for long at a time. But. its
clutch niton the shrinking heartstrings
as Wells would say.
THE WATTERGAW.
Ae weet foronicht i’ th’ yow trummle
I saw von antrin thing
A Wattergaw, wi’ its chitterin’ licht,
Ayont th’ onding....
An’ I thocht o’ th’ last wild look ye gied
Afore ye deed.
There was nae reek i’ th’ laverock’s hoose
That nicht —an’ nane in mine,
But I hae thocht o’ that fulish licht
Ever sin syne;
An’ I think that, mebbe, at last I ken
What your look meant then.
That, as Mr. Spence reverently points out,
“is not to be criticised; it is to be remem-
bered,” though it would seem that the one
might prove easier than the other. If any
comment were needed to conclude this note,
it might be found in the lofty peroration
with which Mr. Spence concludes his gospel:
Onlv those who possess an adequate comparative
knowledge of the psychologies of the two great
British peoples can discern the actual differences
between English and Scottish poetry. It is not a
task for the superficial.
To which verdict it may be permitted to
add a rider in the shape of that pregnant
and all-embracing Scottish comment: —
“Imphm!”
J. B. HIGGINSON.
Accents
As a State-school teacher of 10 years
N. S. Wales experience, spread over a garden
suburb, an out-west township, a South Coast
mining-village, a workmen’s suburb and a
city school, lamat a loss to account for
the idea voiced by James Green (B.
14/10/’26) that “grace is ‘griee’ and cakes
‘kikes’ ” in this State. Among all tlie‘ faults
I have had daily to criticise in children of
such widely differing districts, the “111 have
some kike' first and the gripes afterwards
type falls sharply and strangely on my ear
when I have a Cockney child among them.
That we have an accent which seems
strange to anyone hearing it for the first
time no sane person could doubt, since other-
wise we should stand alone in the world s
history. To insist that that accent is wrong
merely because it differs from the hearer s
is the limit of absurdity. It is merely a
mark of identification, which one should be
able to mention as naturally as one mentions
a badge or a uniform, without wondering
whether the other party will be amused or
offended. Oddly enough, it is always the
Englishman, in whose own country every
town or village has its own accent, who tells
the rest of the Anglo-Saxon world that theirs
is “utterly wrong,” and cannot be otherwise
until they make it an exact copy of his. let
if one told the same man, “You must expect
to be considered a barbarian until you dye
your light hair and try a color-grafting
experiment on your blue eyes, because my
hair and eyes are brown,” he would look
round for a policeman or a keeper.
If the accent cranks have any genuine
wish to benefit both the tongue and the race,
they might stop snarling over their failure
to 'create a dead-level accent in an empire
that embraces every climate in the world,
and combine against the “thingummybob.
“what‘s its name” and “Oh, well, y know
what I mean” habit that is rapidly murder-
ing all the dignity and beauty of our lan-
guage. A very little while ago the inability
to express oneself clearly and plainly was
considered lack of breeding or rustic awk-
wardness, yet to-day there is nothing over
drawn in Wodeliouse’s aristocratic youth,
with the usual years of Oxford just behind
him. who can do no better than “That
blighted blighter Florence is an absolute
blighter.”
THE SCOLCAT.
A Satchel of Books
Marvels of Modern Mechanics, by Harold T. Vi ilkins
(Fisher Unwin). Not a dry chronicle of the modern
mastery of land, sea and air, but a story that
gathers up the romantic elements in scientific research
and achievement within the memory of the present
generation. From the conquest of the atom, the
wonders of wires and wireless, the navigation of
the airways down to such relatively humble matters
as the scenic art of the theatre the author carries his
reader along with unchecked interest.
Music and the Gramophone, by H. L. Wilson
(Allen and Unwin). “When one piece of blare came
to a rest one merely turned the handle and started
the thing’ off again, in the same nonchalant way one
inserted pennies in the gas-meter.” That was the
gramophone of the past ; but. the writer claims, in
recent years the one-time rack of torture has become
a genuine musical instrument and has great possi-
bilities One of the modern uses of the developed
gramophone has been to bring the people not only
extracts from but complete classic works, and the
compiler of this volume writes interestingly about
the composers of the past and present whose music
has been thus transmitted.
The Twilight of the White Races, by Maurice
Muret (Fisher Unwin). The latest clinical exami-
nation of suffering Europe. The present pathologist,
a French journalist, finds his patient in parlous
condition. Her pulse is fast, her temperature high,
she is afflicted with debased currency, unneighborly
jealousy and falling birth-rates, and, since the
Great War, her resistance to infections like cheap
colored labor, Bolshevism and Woodrow Wilsonism
has been seriously lowered. Like most hypochon-
driacs, she is alternately absurdly timorous and
dangerously over-confident. Her self-confidence
makes her eager to extend her sway over more
colored people and her timidity makes her irritable
in her dealings with those she owns. They respond
with boycotts and revolts which further enfeeble
her. The author’s remedy is to admit the colored
races to the League of Nations, where the problems
of the world may be discussed temperately and
dispassionately.
Magic Casements, by Helen E. Wallace (Brown,
Prior and Co.). A limited edition de luxe of an
Australian story in which the writer blends the
things of earth and the enchantments of Fairyland.
Through the magic casements youth looks into the
world of dreams where birds and beasts become
articulate and round every corner lurk mysteries
and wonders. The story of John and Barbara Bell,
Aunt Sue and Uncle Jack is told With a charm that
will lure elders as well as youngsters. The book
is well produced and is illustrated by three repro-
ductions of characteristic Blamire Young water-colors.
John-Barbara, by Kathleen O’Brien (John Lane).
.Tohn-Barbara is a friend not of the flesh, but of
the spirit. The John part has spiritual ardor and
the adventurous mind; the Barbara side has the
feminine qualities, including a kind, joyous heart.
Through the drab life of an educated girl, a typist
in a business house, living alone in a little flat,
catering and cooking for herself, the company of
John-Barbara sustains her will to live happily and
helpfully. Her life is described with a felicitous
touch and a sympathy that engage the interest;
and a little love romance weaves its thread through
the story. This first book won the Panton Club’s
competition of last year.
Children of the Morning, by W. L. George
(Chapman and Hall). This novel in its present
complete form was found among the papers left
by the author at his death. George’s name has
been associated with literature dealing with econo-
mics, sociology and sex psychology. The posthumous
work stands by itself as an attempt in Actional
form to analyse the essentials of human nature and
postulate therefrom the directions that will inevit-
ably be taken in its development. The author for
his purpose draws lavishly upon the imagination.
By a series of catastrophes at sea, a company of
children, the whole body of survivors, is ship-
wrecked on an uninhabited island. Not one of the
youngsters exceeded the age of eight. The author
traces the progress of this little group through the
period of merely animal instincts into the stone
age, the age of dawning civilisation and so on to
the building of Home City and the establishment
of social law. Through war, dissension and tumult
peace was ultimately secured by the dominance of
military power. Then came the golden years; but
as happiness became the rule of life, discontent
spread over the isle. “To rise at dawn, to worship,
to hunt, to fish, to cat, to till the soil, to lie down
to sleep and rise again....it was not enough. There
were no masters, no slaves, in this perfect democracy,
so there were none to enjoy domination, and there
were none who could aspire to dominate. There
was no hope of anything save happiness, and that
was not enough.” So in this isolated and self-
developed community human nature is shown to be
what it has been and will ever be —the one story
repeated for all time. A curious, interesting and
thoughtful book with the life and color of a romance.
A Rude lloolc, by Tell (Cecil Palmer).
“A parfit and a gentle knight
Don Chesterton sets forth to fight.
Armed with a paradox and pen
He hits a windmill now and then.”
This is the tag to a clever caricature of Chesterton
in a volume of many equally clever personal outlines.
Within the pages of this rude book which tempers
its rudeness with good humor and never allows its fun
to lapse into malice are 26 caricatures, the sub-
jects ranging from Mr. Tell himself, “the only
begetter of this book of satires,” to the Prime
Minister, and including Lady Astor and the gloomy
Dean, Suzanne Lenglen and G. B. Shaw, Augustus
John and Jacob Epstein.
The British Drama League Library (Basil Black-
well). One of the most important functions of
the league is the selection by its reading committee
of plays deemed to be worthy of publication. In
some cases they have been produced by a Repertory
Theatre or been played in a provincial house. The
league is not guided wholly by acting merits, u
has regard also to literary values. In lhe uiq
Adam,” a fantastic three-act comedy by Cicely
Hamilton, the playwright works an original.idea.
Buritania is threatened by war with its arm)
prepared to the last button. Comes to its rescue a
little man in an apologetic manner. His research
into the properties of the Hertzian ray have demon
strated the possibilities m long-distance cont .
By its means the little man can hold up trains,
cars, steamships, aeroplanes —m fact, P

successfully, only too successfully, foi it holds P
not only the enemies of Buritania R" >ta
itself A very ingenious little comedy. The Tende
Parson,” by Hubert Griffith, contains some smart
dialogue and some decadent morality; and
Barber and the Cow,” by D. T. DaVies, has merit.
Dmncr, by Clive Hamilton (Dent). Immortal
love, a vision alone of which is granted o us
here and whose fulfilment lies beyond the gates
of death, forms the theme of this poem, which is
informed by thought and has both digmtj and
harmony in expression.
The First Age of Christianity, by Ernest F. bcott
(Allen and Unwin). “This book,” says its author
a New York Professor of Theology, is intended
primarily as introductory to the study of C hristian
origins from the modern point of view. A ehaptei
on “The Gospel Record” gives an interesting sum-
mary of the research. work that has been done in
this’ respect. “Criticism,” comments Dr. Scott, has
made it clear that in our gospels there are various
strata, some of them of less historic value than
others” ; but “we can now accept, not merely _by
an act of faith but on the ground of strict historical
evidence, the essential facts concerning the life ot
Christ.”
llow to Write a Film Story, by Gertrude M.
Allen (Allen and Unwin). “Authorship for the
screen has not yet been the success that might have
been expected,” wrote a critic of films recently,
“Leading producers,” he remarked, “have offered
high prices for original work, but without satisfactory
response except in a relatively small number of cases.
The author of this handbook provides would-be
aspirants for this class of quasi-literary work with
the elementary technique of scenario-writing. ‘Once
a grip of the rudiments of this form of story-making
is secured,” says the author, “anyone who has
imagination enough to create the kind of story which
screens well could turn that story into a film play.
An interesting and useful little hook.
Conversations with Anatole France, by Nicholas
Segur (John Lane). “France,” remarks M. Segur,
“was born lacking that salutary faculty which enables
the human species to enjoy the consolation of illu-
sions.” To grow old—France died in his 81st
year—and look down the vista of life so stripped
of its illusions that not a fragment remains for
solace on the grim ferryman’s passage is a sorry
thing. Further, the brilliant cynic could not brook the
ending of years so full of interest. “We can con-
template readily enough,” he used to say, “the
death of others; but we cannot bring our minds to
realise our own disappearance from the scene.” On
the last spring season greeted by the Master’s eyes,
he remarked to Segur “in a voice of infinite sadness
that I shall never forget: ‘See, spring is here again.
How foolish and how sad is this passionate eagerness
of Nature to bring forth, to build nests, to make the
living run riot above the bones of the dead, to
perpetuate on the old earth’s crust this sorry layer
of mildew we dignify with the name of Life!’”
♦
“R. Mort”: The Lindsays, with the aid of the
Fanfrolico Press, are tickling the appetites of English
book-collectors this autumn. Jack is responsible
for a dramatic poem entitled “Marino Faliero” and
a new translation of “Lysistrata” ; for the latter
Norman has done the pen-drawings. He has also
decorated Kenneth Slessor’s new hook of verse with
a woodcut. These three books are issued in limited
editions, each copy numbered and signed, and it is
not likely that many will find their way to Australia.

In the Orchard.
Poppies and forget-me-nots bloom amidst the
grass,
Dandelions and escholtzias gleam like pol-
ished brass;
Buttercups and clover feed the honey-bees,
Over in the orchard, beneath the apple-trees.
Hedges screen the orchard from the garden
neat
Where yellow gravel pathways circumscribe
your feet;
But there in the wilderness, beneath the
apple-trees,
You tread a fragrant carpet at any point
you please.
The humble orchard blossoms could never
learn to grow
Like those within the garden in stately line
and row;
They are friendly little flowers, and they love
to take their ease
In amongst the rye-grass beneath the apple-
trees.

Return.
Reading by firelight in the rainy dusk.
I think pale sunbeams interlace the glooms
With faintest scent of lavender and musk
Blown from the chintz of Cranford’s de-
mure rooms.
And, smiling, I look from the page and see
The shining bookshelves so much friend-
ship fills,
The ruby glow of old mahogany.
Blue cushions and a bowl of daffodils.
A little marble nymph gleams like a flower,
The mute sweet keyboard waits to be con-
fessed ;
Round on the rug, hushed by the purring
shower,
The cat curls in an ecstasy of rest.
Footsteps! A latchkey in the door outside —
And all the crystal peace without alloy
That haunts a hearth where lonely dreams
abide
Is shattered into leaping flames of joy!

A Plea for Respectability.
Friend, grant Respectability a heart
And some sincerity. If garments neat
And still prim mannerisms in a street
Of motley manners have no friendly part
In the untrammelled life that rovers know
Who _go adventuring on sands and seas,
Or over hearts and passions, are not these
The differences that make the venture
glow ?
They have their place who sit by homely
fires,
Or tread sedately under trim-set trees;
And if sometimes their eyes be dull and
blind,
Is he the more forbearing who aspires?
For limited respectabilities
May sometimes understand, are sometimes
kind.

Four Captains.
Three captains met on Pyrmont quay
Who’d come from far-ofE places—
From Newport News and Pe-chi-li
And Suez, where the sun and sea
Make brown the seamen’s faces.
Three captains spoke of one they’d known
Who with his ship was resting
Where never man heard tempests moan,
Nor beat of surf on sand or stone,
Nor sound of sailors jesting.
Three captains toasted solemnly
Their comrade, many a mile hence.
They spoke awhile of wind and sea
And whereabouts his ship should be —
And drank again in silence.
Three captains parted where their ships,
Like shackled giants resting,
Still held the strong sea-smell that grips;
They said good-bye with smiling lips
And pleasant words half-jesting.
But when three captains sailed away
Another captain followed
Their white wakes in a ship all grey,
That took no channel down the bay,
And by the night was swallowed.

The blue day is dawning, is dawning, is
dawning,
In jasper and opal, in ruby and flame;
Out of the twilight of Time’s farthest
borders,
Muffled feet treading, eyes burning, she
came!
The blue day is dawning, is dawning, is
dawning,
Think! Will you let it slip useless away?
Will you be wasting a pearl of your heritage
Where has been dawning another blue
day?
Time is a bird, and her soft azure plumage
Darkens in omen of ultimate night;
Time is a bird, and our days are her flutter-
ings—
Wing-beats and song-beats in rapturous
flight.
Time is the whole of mortality’s treasure,
Flung o’er the world as she swings on her
way;
Time, golden-throated! Go, tread we a
measure,
Mortals, oh mortals, this singing blue
day!

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1926.
AT A POLITICAL DEATH-BED
Since June, 1925, the Ma State has ex-
perienced a sort of Parliamentary government
without precedent in Australia. Thanks to a
fraudulent device called proportionalism, a
Labor-Soviet party which polled 48 p.c. of
the votes came back from the constituencies
with 46 Assemblymen out of 90, and was
thus enabled to take office and put its own
Speaker in the chair. In his policy speech
its leader had said that it had “nothing in
common with Communism,” and did not in-
tend to “rush madly ahead of public
opinion” ; “when the electors vote for Labor
candidates,” he added, “they vote for what is
here proposed, and not for anything else, so far
as the next Parliament is concerned.” But
his tone changed as soon as he became head
of a Government "with the smallest possible
majority; he boasted then that he had
received “a full and unequivocal mandate,”
and has since become notorious for surround-
ing himself with Communists, rushing madly
ahead of public opinion and betraying elec-
tors who relied upon his word. The Govern-
ment began by sacking the Director of
Finance and hounding a Nationalist out of
the London agency. Among its early legis-
lative performances were a reduction of four
hours in the working week, the placing of the
Railway Department under job control, and
the scrapping of the existing arbitration
machinery, which had worked fairly well, for
an alleged conciliation system with a soft-
hearted doctrinaire at the head and a shoal of
Labor sympathisers to assist him. The Forty-
four Hour Week Act, which had been reck-
lessly promised to all manner of employees
in order to get their votes, was presently de-
clared unconstitutional as regards the indus-
tries regulated by the Federal Arbitration
(Jourt. In some of those industries it was a
source of serious work-stoppages ending in
reduced pay. And the Workers’ Compensa-
tion Act, after having been the cause of wide-
spread unemployment, is now dismissed
by the Worker as “a monumental failure,”
because of “defective drafting or bad
administration, possibly a lot of both.”
* * * *
A salary steal of £32,000 p.a. in the aggre-
gate and a campaign against the Leg. Council
were not among the matters mentioned by the
person who said “When you vote for Labor
candidates you vote for what is here pro-
posed, and not for anything else, as far as
the next Parliament is concerned.” The
attempt to abolish the nominee institution,
excrescence though it be, was a bad breach
of faith with the people and a worse breach
of faith with Governor De Chair. That
functionary was induced to appoint 25
Councillors nominated by the Government on
the clear understanding that they would not
be used for abolition purposes, before the
electors were consulted, at any rate. Object-
ing that the number was excessive, there
being 71 Leg. Councillors already, he was
assured in white and black that the appoint-
ments would “not mean the putting of an
end to the Council’s value as a deliberative
and revising Chamber.” In spite of this
assurance abolition was forthwith attempted ;
that it failed egregiously was owing to two
Labor Councillors revolting and four others
absenting themselves. Further appointments
being demanded, the Governor refused them,
whereupon the boorish Premier and his satel-
lites made a personal matter of it. The
Attorney-General was sent abroad to induce
Downing-street to interfere on the Govern-
ment’s side, which Downing-street politely
declined to do.
* * * *
Meanwhile the Labor Daily, of which the
Premier and two of his followers were direc-
tors, ferreted out a “plot” to bribe “suscep-
tible” Labor Assemblymen with £32,000 of
Nationalist gold. The Premier promptly sent
for Kay, M.L.A., who had got in as an
Independent, and bought his seat for a tame
supporter (the proportional system lends
itself to such jobs) with a seven-years’ billet
at £l5OO p.a. This transaction was justified
by a Trades Hall boss on the ground that
“politics is a dirty game.” A Parliamentary
select committee which was forced on the
sullen Premier and reluctant guardian of
his party’s honor reports that the “plot”
was the nefarious concoction of a profes-
sional informer. .The appointment of this com-
mittee was an incident of a mutiny headed
by Loughlin, Minister for Lands, and second
only to the Premier in Cabinet and party.
Saying, among other things, that the Premier
had allied himself with Communists and that
the party was therefore in danger of being
captured by “men alien to the sentiment and
spirit of Australia,” Loughlin resigned from
his positions and asked Caucus to make him
leader and, in effect, Premier. To Lang’s
aid rushed a swarm of union secretaries led
by Garden, the Moscow pilgrim, who
picketed the approaches to, and lined the cor-
ridors of, Parliament House, demanding that
Caucus should hear their “arguments” in
Lang’s favor (which Caucus tremblingly
did) andi shouting threats at individual
Loughlinites as they entered or left the room.
The voting was 23 for Lang and 23 for
Loughlin, the latter being unanimously re-
elected deputy-leader—and the rivals resumed
their seats on the same Treasury bench.
Lang’s friends presently summoned a special
Labor conference, at which he was author-
ised to throw the Loughlinites out of his
Ministry—invested with “dictatorial powers,”
as both Labor papers agree. Loughlin
replied by resigning again, explaining that
he could not submit to a dictatorship which
would be wielded, in effect, by the Com-
munists, and that if the dictatorship were
not ended he would do his best to end the
Government. Incidentally, he said there were
“two or three statements in the Budget which
will require very serious consideration.”
* * * *
Loughlin’s few words about the Budget
could be expanded to a bulky volume with-
out exhausting the subject. Lang poses as
a pillar of “sound finance”—he lards him-
self with the phrase again and again—but
he must have taken Micawber and the
Jubilee Plunger for teachers. Breaking
away from the Australian Loan Council be-
cause that body does, in its fashion, restrict
borrowing and stand for a sinking fund, he
lias relied on London for the means of giving
his clients the 44-hour week and making
N. S. Wales a paradise for unskilled laborers
where industry and efficiency don’t matter.
His whole policy, such as it is, is based on
London loans; yet by waging war on the
harmless Governor and British insurance
companies, by squandering £11,278.000 of
borrowed money last year, by refusing to
establish a sinking fund and blundering into
a deficit, by making friends of notorious
repudiationists and resorting to forms of
repudiation himself, he is doing his stupid
best to alienate the London lenders, and his
last loan was a dud. Budgeting in the sixth
month of 1925-26 for a surplus of £13,609.
he wound up the twelfth month with a debit
balance of £1,274,000. In the fifth month
he has budgeted for a surplus of
£139,100, but he has left a certain increase
in the basic wage out of his calculations,
and at least one of his proposals for getting
m more revenue will crash. He talks of
raising another half-million by increased
freight rates on agricultural produce, live-
stock, coal, oil and general merchandise (this
although fie solemnly pledged himself to reduce
oaa 1 ? rates a P d fares) ;of taking
iooU’OOO from the Main Roads Board, whose
funds are provided by motorists, and shoving
it into general revenue, which will be high-
way robbery in the literal sense; and of
dragging in £400,000 by a tax on publica-
tions, which impost, the Labor Daily glee-
fully announces, is designed to make “Lang-
baiting papers pay for their fun.” But bad
as . ® uc .b a tax may be and atrocious the
spirit in which it is conceived, it is not at
all the worst feature of the situation. The
intolerable thing is that the power of the
people and their representatives has been
undermined by men sworn to protect and
preserve it, and that the actual government
of the country has been passed over to people
who certainly have no authority from the
people of N. S. Wales, whatever other war-
rant they may have. No more outrageous
assault upon democratic rule and popular
government has ever been made in Australia;
and the people will surely know how to
punish it when they get a chance to act.
THE MA STATE’S MAD RAILWAYS.
The N. S. Wales Railways report, just
issued, shows that the capital invested has
at last passed the one hundred million mark,
the total being £105,237,668. It is all bor-
rowed, and as the State owes a great deal
more than that in England, it is all bor-
rowed abroad. In that respect N. S. Wales
is in a worse position than Victoria, which
raised some of its railway loans and all the
money .invested in oddments and trashy ven-
tures inside Australia, so that the interest
can be paid with paper currency, but the
other four members of the Commonwealth
are ln same leaky boat as N. S.
Wales. The States really own not a
yard of railway, but they manage a
great deal for private capitalists who are
all preference shareholders, their dividend
being payable whether it is earned or not.
The rate which N. S. Wales’s creditors col-
lect is now £5 2s. lid. per cent, per annum,
which is more than the banks allow on fixed
deposits, and the tendency is for rates to go
up, both on old and new debt. The takings
for last year were £169,580 more than in
the preceding year, the tale about loss of
traffic through an inferior season being the
same sort that Ananias told shortly before
the undertaker called for the body. In fact,
the takings were never so high before, and
the loss was never so high either, though the
previous worst record, when the Lang party
held office in 1921, was startling enough. For
the year to June, 1926, the deficit, after
Paymg working expenses and interest, was
£830,671, and as the previous year shpwed
a profit of £32,937 the very sudden difference
was £863,608. It was a good deal to pay
for the pleasure of hearing Lang and Mc-
Tiernan perform. A really good year in
the record was 1911, when there was a clear
profit of £553,998 \ but there have been
Plenty of other good years. If these profits
had been applied to reduce the railway debt
and the interest bill it might have made all
the difference between solvency and bank-
ruptcy, but Australian State Governments
have always been fools in financial matters
—varying from 5 per cent, donkey to 100
per cent, ass with an increasing tendency to
be the entire and total mule. The 44-hour
week was in force for a little less than half
the last year and it added £191,314 to
expenses. For a whole year it should be good
for about £400,000. Yet expensive Pidding-
tons and Beebys are still inquiring whether
the loss of one-twelfth of the working week
makes any difference in the cost of produc-
tion. A Government of foresight and cour-
age would have put up railway charges simul-
taneously with the increase of wages and
reduction of hours, but the Lang crowd
never did any wise thing in time.
* * * *
The mileage of railway working and earn-
ing money increased by 14 per cent. But
the loan money invested in railways in-
creased by nearly 64 per cent. This was due
m part to the quantity of costly work which
is staggering towards completion but not
arriving there. It has been frequently urged
that the accounts should be cooked by charg-
ing the interest on capital buried in un-
finished works to general revenue, as the
charging of it to the Railway accounts heaps
undeserved, contempt on the Commissioners.
1 o which it may be replied that there is no
other place where this interest can
honestly be charged, that too many
accounts are cooked already, that it is
best for the people to see things in all their
nude, rude, crude insolvency, and that
undeserved contempt is the natural lot of
Commissioners under a regime like the pre-
sent. The interest payable to the Private
Enterprise capitalists who own the lines,
x J~o oo, Ma State thinks are hers, was
±402,881 more for the year just completed
than tor the one previous. There never was
such a huge increase in a single year before
but it is expected that there will often be
one again, or, rather, that there often would
be one but for the giving out of the big
loans. The interest bill i s double that of
.10 years ago, though the amount of line in
existence has only expanded by about one-
tliira. -Ine additions made during the year,
winch was rather barren, consisted of four
bits or sections, measuring 86 miles. Not
one of them indicated a desire to make a new
port available, or to shorten the long road
tor any ‘ primary producer’s” exports to the
sea. They were of the usual minor-job char-
acter, for the Ministry has no earthly use
tor the primary producer,” except as a
supposed thickhead to be easily deceived at
election time.
* * * *
Looking at the map it is hard to find any
definite plan in the lay-out of the lines. In
some places three dead-ends are stealthily
approaching each other, and apparently they
will join some day and make something re-
sembling a wheel. At other places they have
closed m and made an irregular sort of stock-
yard or bag, so that the settler is shut in by
railways. Due west from Newcastle, but not
connected with it, is a group of such bags,
and to the south of the group more are in
process of formation. The list of money-
losing lines or sections numbers 51. There
would be more, but several have been con-
solidated during the year, to make one big
loss m preference to several small ones. They
cover 2590 miles out of a total of 5742, anil
they failed last year to pay interest and work-
ing expenses by £1,204,825. Twenty-four of
tlie collection failed to pay half their costs,
the names, dates and deficiencies of these
thorough-paced derelicts being as follows:

The two biggest losers, both dead-ends which
stop short of a port, are not on the above list
because, despite their achievements, they
didn’t succeed in making their expenditure
quite double their income.
* * * *
The pace of railway construction in
N.SyW. has certainly been rapid compared
with the growth of population, but that is
the least of five evils. The other four are :
(1) The community can’t afford to invest huge
sums in “developmental” railways if at the same
time the policy is to develop no port or city save
Sydney, and populate no area except the county
of Cumberland.
(2) It can’t afford to build with little or no fixed
plan, but mostly in scraps and patches and here
and there in order to influence the course of votes
and serve the purposes of the moment, usually bad
ones. »
(3) It can’t afford to build with slow and in-
efficient labor which must not be hurried for fear
of losing its political support, or precipitating a
general strike.
(4) It can’t afford to build wholly with cumula-
tive preference capital bearing interest at £5 2s.
lid. per cent, per annum. When a pioneer line like
the Glenreagh-Dorrigo is loaded with an interest
bill of £1660 per mile per annum, the interest
being more than twice the working expenses, the
situation becomes tragic. It is urgently necessary
to reduce the debt and the load of interest by means
of a sinking fund, and to pay part of the cost of
new works out of revenue. Then a more conservative
view might be taken regarding new works.
The Government is doing something, though
nothing very relevant. It wants to sack the
State Governor and the Upper House. It
has a device for driving wool-growers off the
land and putting on wheat-growers instead.
Wool pays the railways £1 Bs. 7d. per ton
per 100 miles, which is a large profit, and
wheat pays ss. 3d., which is a heavy loss.
The Railway Commissioners are already in
the position that they have no power to pre-
vent hopelessly unpromising lines, built at
impossible prices, being foisted on them, so
the idea is advanced that their powers should
be reduced. And the proposition that the
railway employees should elect one Commis-
sioner from among themselves has taken a
new shape, the idea being that persons who
are not employees should be eligible for the
position of employees’ Commissioner, how-
ever ignorant they may be of railway mat-
ters. Wherefore there will be keen competi-
tion for the billet among prominent commu-
nists, professional strike-makers and their
kind, with the usual “uncouth crooks” taking
a hand in the election. The situation is full
of interest, quite apart from the £5 2s. lid.
per cent, interest and the year's loss of
£830,671.
AS A WOMAN SEES CANBERRA.
Whatever sort of barren hell Canberra may
be when the hand of summer is heavy upon
it, in October and November it is a pleasant
place. Cupped within the foothills of the
Southern Alps, its design would give joy to
the heart of Einstein, for it is to be a
city of curves, built in rhythm with the.
serried ranks of hills that rise beyond. Five
of the peaks are known by name, and three
of them at least come tripping to the tongue;
there’s Stromlo, and there’s Red Hill, and
the mount called Pleasant; and all five of
them are framed by the pillared arches of
the terraces of Parliament House. In their
greys and green they tremble and ripple
up to the blue haze of the Alps beyond with
a sort of Christian’s Progress effect.
But there is nothing of early-Christian
humility and poverty about this deliberately-
made city. Into its building the wealth of
the nation is being poured with reckless
gesture. Small, forests of the woods as
precious to Australia as were the cedars to
Lebanon have been used in the panelling of
Parliament House, blackwood, black bean,
jnrrah, polished and hand-worked till the
beauty of their veining thrills. Marbles are
here, and brasses clamping great doorways,
and a basement like the engine-room of an
ocean-liner dedicated to keeping the great
building and the exiled representatives of the
people at a uniform heat and coolth. With
one exception, every corridor and room of
the impressive white stone building is
flooded with daylight. The one exception is
the reference library. Another unconscious
comedy has been the placing of the suites
for the Prime Minister, the leader of the
Opposition, the Speaker and the President
at the four remotest corners of the building.
The roads are good, and will in time be
all tree-planted. These trees are being
reared under the eye of John Hobday at
the nursery at Acton. Between the rows of
pinus imiqnis, of hawthorn, of California
oaks, of holly and Italian cypresses he walks
with such a wary eye for pests as Adam
might have had when, evicted from the
Garden, he strove in the sweat of his brow
to rear the bush and tree and flower of his
former delight. Starting at the seed, these
trees are first coaxed to fill pots not much
larger than a giantess’s thimble. Gradually
the baby trees are promoted to larger and
still larger pots, and finally, when they have
reached an age at which they are getting

the Sunken lawns around which Parliament
House is built. . . ,
Water, sewerage and electric light are
accomplished facts before the army of official-
dom that is to inhabit Canberra has begun
to pack its bag in Melbourne. The water is
delicious. It comes from the Cotter (a twin
stream to the Leitu that babbles its way
through Dunedin in Maoriland, and, like it,
too, a trout stream), is mostly snow-
seepage, and is declared to be 100 per cent,
pore. The Cotter dam is one of Canberra’s
beauty-spots. It is a place where dryads
from the hills around probably bathe by
moonlight, and in cold, hard fact repre-
sents a cascade of Australian silver. No
building may arise haphazard in Can-
berra; a place is marked for everything—
even an aerodrome. The only institution the
Commission whose hand administers Canberra
had not to think about was the Anglican
Church on the hill above the bridge that
crosses the Molonglo. For nearly a hundred
years that has stood, and now it looks down
aloof on the city that is arising on the other
side of the river.
Even in its unfinished state Canberra has
an urban air. There is nothing rustic in
the dress or deportment of its inhabitants.
Not the stamp of the surroundings do they
bear, but rather do they stamp their sur-
roundings. Indeed, the sophistication of
Melbourne and Sydney and the culture of
Adelaide are in the atmosphere. Already
brains are spilling over. There is the
brilliant little scientific group at the Obser-
vatory, and the almost ambassadorial circle
of the Commission. Between these two
influences your Canberra man and woman
of the future will wear their manners with
ease, and may be acclaimed the scholarly
children of the race. For in this as in
every other way Canberra is starting upside
down, with a population of the educated
classes; so much so that, though the hewing
of wood and the damming of water (Can-
berra is very dry) is carried out by gangs
of imported labor, the local laundress is
practically non-existent. Very often the
important young men who bid you good-niglit
debonairly after a junketing are hurrying
home to wring through a collar or two, and
then iron them by screwing them in the
letter-press against the break o’ day. For
the Commission which is to Canberra what
the East India Co. was to India, or the
A.D.F.A. (when De Garis was king) to
Mildura, absorbs all available domestic labor
for the staffing of its hotels.
Up on a rise that swoops down to the
Molonglo and has the golf-links within three
minutes’ walk at its back stand the pictorial
Commission offices. These are built in a
semi-circular block, which contains also post-
office and Commonwealth Bank, and the
curve is filled just now with plump snap-
dragon, giant sweet-pea and the bright-blow-
ing broom. The white, pillared, one-storey
buildings make the only pleasant break on
the uneventful but bottle-strewn road to
Queanbeyan nine miles away and very
wet. To the right of the buildings, away
from the road, is the experimental nursery,
now too small to be of much use, but an
Arcadian retreat of soft grasses and
green oaks, holly and the decorative cypress.
There is talk of turning this into a kiddies’
playground, complete with Bound Pond and
Peter Pan —and surely there is no place
where Peter could be happier.
Lire will be a leisurely affair at Canberra,
for no industrial bustle will disturb it. There
will be no unemployment, for, where every
man holds an official appointment, with the
sack he will take his departure. Tourists
the world over will come to this spot of
cultivated beauty and marvel at the richness
of a young country that can afford to wear
such an exotic bloom in the lapel of its
artisan’s smock. Cliques and small snob-
beries will prevail where every man will
know to a halfpenny the other’s salary;
where, although there is no absolute dicta-
tion that a man shall live at Ainslie (the
middle-class suburb) or at Blanfordia, or on
Bed Hill, the plans of a man’s dwelling
must be approved by the Powers, and in
certain districts no house on which a speci-
fied sum is not snent may be erected. For
the young, socially-ambitious woman whose
husband is a minor official Canberra will be
a very neat and complete hell. But for the
wise young woman who is content to play
with her children in the small nursery in the
afternoons, or do her round of golf unheedful
of the recognition of those in higher stations,
or rest happily on the hillside while her
husband catches trout in the Cotter or perch
in the Molonglo, or walk betwmen rows of
young pines and oaks with John Hobday,
the keeper of the nursery, while he tells her
the way to rout garden pests and how to
distinguish the good little ladybird from its
mischievous cousin, Canberra may be filled
with “light and cheerfulness and grace, and
peace within the border.”
NORA McAULIFFE.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Bruce, the Optimist.
When British bankers invited this country’s
Prime Minister to dinner he had either
to go and talk Australian finance to them
or send a medical certificate and take to
his bed. He, or somebody made up to resemble
him, went and talked, and if the cabled
report is reliable - he discoursed more wdldly
than he had been thought capable of. He
is represented as saying, among less impor-
tant matters: —
The war debt is Australia’s only non-productive
burden. As regards the other liabilities, they are
represented by “direct and indirect assets” which
“more than cover the moneys borrowed and expended
on them.”
The railways are a perfectly sound and solvent
investment. “Australia’s other public investments
give incalculable returns.”
Australia is rushing headlong towards a time when
it will be quite able to do without outside loans.
Mr. Biiuce failed to see why lenders should want
more information than they get about the kind of
works in which their money is invested, but there
is no reason, apart from a matter of dignity, why
they shouldn’t know everything. There is nothing
doing which can’t stand inspection. Meanwhile he
reminded critics that the Australian “Official Year
Book” reveals all, without reserve.
He added that this favored laud had already
progressed so fast that only 49 per cent, of
its debt is due to people outside, whereas
they held 86 per cent, of it 25 years ago.
That sounds almost as if a great deal had
been paid off. But unfortunately the 49
per cent, now owing abroad is nearly three
times as large as the 86 per cent, owing there
in 1901, and the 51 per cent, now held in
Australia amounts to about 17 times as many
pounds as the 14 per cent, held here in 1901.
The “Official Year Book” really gives skimpy
intelligence about the way the State loans
are invested, but large amounts are men-
tioned as being for “public buildings, land
repurchased for settlement, advances to
settlers, other public works and purposes,”
and similar dubious and tripey items. Cer-
tainly it would be a bad time to furnish
full details of a public works policy when
a Government which admits that the situa-
tion is very bad seeks £lOO,OOO of loan money
for prickly-pcar destruction, £450,000 for
roads, £250,000 for hospitals, and money for
a long list of similar items, finishing with 24
millions to complete railways, most of which
the dejected borrower regards as certain
losses for a long while. It can hardly be
that the heroic oration of Bruce or the man
who looked like him was really intended for
the bankers, who probably feel as dejected
as Bruce possibly does himself. It reads
more as if it was meant for the investing
public which takes both new and renewal
loans off the bankers’ hands, and it is
earnestly hoped will continue to do so.
$
Redistribution.
A Ministerialist remarked in the Victorian
Assembly one day last week, just before the
House refused to adopt the latest Redistribu-
tion Bill, that the only mistake the Ministry
had made was in not providing that the
Commissioners’ report should become law as
soon as it was laid on the table of the House.
Until something of this sort is sanctioned,
there will be very little chance of equitable
representation of the people in Parliament
being obtained in Victoria or anywhere else.
The business of altering boundaries and
redistributing seats should be taken alto-
gether out of the hands of the persons
interested, on the excellent legal ground
that nobody ought to be a judge in his own
case. The present process is that, when
congested electorates and depleted electorates
become sufficiently abundant in any State, the
Government in power—unless it is profiting
thereby, in which case it is liable to contem-
plate the situation with entire complacency—
announces that redistribution of seats can be
postponed no longer. Obviously, if it were
to do the redistributing itself the Opposition
would immediately accuse it of gerrymander-
ing. Therefore, glowing with conscious virtue,
it deputes three impartial and scrupulously
honorable civil servants, including, generally
a Supreme Court Judge, to do the job. As
it is likely to be a matter of supreme indiffer-
ence to the Commissioners whether Cork Tree
Flat shall be represented at next election by
a Liberal or a C.P. man, or Frog Hollow
shall continue a safe Labor seat or otherwise,
the redistribution and abolition and amal-
gamation of electorates are pretty certain to
be done as fairly as it is possible to do such
things in conformity with certain guiding
principles and quotas that have been im-
pressed on the attention of the Commissioners.
The trouble begins when the report is sub-
mitted to Parliament. The Opposition, which
is perfectly satisfied and generally quite justi-
fied in believing that it is going to lose by
redistribution or the Government would not
have undertaken it, howls like one man that
the new scheme is iniquitous and that seats
are being stolen from it. Every sort of
obstruction that can be devised is used to
retard or prevent the passage of the measure.
And there are pretty certain to be a few
disgruntled persons on the Government side
who either openly or passively are ready to
play the Opposition game. There are the
legislators who conceive their own chances
of return lessened by redistribution and who
are determined to try to save their own Par-
liamentary skins, come what may. They may
be ready to admit that the Commissioners
have done their work well in the main, but
they look at all seats except their own
through the wrong end of the telescope. Two
or three malcontents of this type assisted the
Labor party to wreck Premier Mitchell’s
Redistribution Bill (laboriously prepared by
Commissioners) in Westralia a couple of years
ago. They hardly bothered to disguise that
they were setting their own personal interests
above the country’s, and the result is that the
decaying goldfields boroughs of W.A. are
now approaching absolute putridity, for the
Collier Government which succeeded Mit-
cuell is supremely unlikely to abolish half
a dozen seats which supply it with steadfast-
supporters. Much the same thing happened
in Victoria last week, when the Ministry’s
Redistribution Bill was sent back to the Com-
misisoners for revision. The Labor Opposi-
tion, of course, opposed it en masse, and
considerations of personal expediency sent
enough Ministerialists into the lobby with
them to hang up the measure. It may be
asked what is the use in deputing the
rearrangement of electoral boundaries to non-
Parliamentary Commissioners if their recom-
mendations are to be wrangled over just as
bitterly as if a partial Government had done
the job itself with one eye on the polls.
The Commissioners have no axe to grind, but
if the axe-grinding comes afterwards little is
saved by this fine assumption of remitting the
work to men.who are obviously impartial.
The worst judge of how constituencies should
be framed for the return of members to Parlia-
ment is Parliament itself, -blinded by party
feeling and too often saturated by self-
interest. A Judge is expected to retire from
the Bench when a case comes on in which
he has any personal interest, or it may be
represented that he has; it would make for
equity if Supreme Courts or some such bodies
were given the power to redistribute elec-
torates periodically without considering the
feelings of either Ministers or members.

The Courage of McCormack.
Premier McCormack introduced a Loan Bill
for £9,000.000 into the Queensland Parlia-
ment on November 9 with an expression of
hope that the amount would last 24 years
or even three. In doing so he made a state-
ment which might be interpreted as meaning
that the State was going downhill fast in
its finances, and for the time it had too
much way on to stop. In addition to being
strictly true, it was the most courageous
utterance a State Premier has made for many
years. And as there is no hope that the
community will attempt to improve the
situation until it is forced to realise that
there is a situation, McCormack’s words
were helpful. The situation, as he described
it, went into three main propositions, after
the fashion of Job’s three miserables arriv-
ing in single file :
(1) The loan money to be spent this year is
£4,815,000. That will leave £4,185,000 for the
following 14 or 2 years, so the pace is to slow
down. At the end of the period it is hoped there
will be more slowing down, if not stoppage. Inci-
dentally the Premier said he would do some cheese-
paring with the £4,815,000 if possible.
(2) The amount to be laid out on railways is
£2,500,000. Of this £1,600,000 is for lines which,
or most of which, the Premier admits, can’t possibly
pay, save perhaps in the dim remote. But the State
is strewn with little undertakings or joblets on
which work has been long (or short) suspended,
because in the great hunt for votes there was a
tendency to begin small jobs anywhere and complete
one big job nowhere. The ruins suggest bottles
spread far and wide after a huge wet picnic. The
Premier thinks it better to finish them and hope
for the future than to abandon them and confess
utter failure, and with 5801 people and their depen-
dants living on the public works policy it is cer-
tainly safer. The remaining £900,000 of railway
expenditure is for rolling stock, much of it to re-
place old stock bought out of loans and worn out.
That isn’t a promising investment either.
(3) The other £2,315,000 is to be spread over a
multitude of minor undertakings which are probably
essential, but which look very unprofitable. The
best excuse for putting them where they are is that
there is no known device by which enough revenue
could be raised to cover them now, though it
wouldn’t have been very difficult in the days before
the wonderful 11-years’ jag.
Not wishing to bo a prophet of unrelieved
gloom the harassed head of the Government
threw in a few lighter touches. He blamed
motor competition for many of the railway
calamities, and threatened to tax or other-
wise deal with his Private Enterprise com-
petitors, which is perhaps the only course to
take. But the Queensland railway system
started for the monetary dogs on the first
day of Labor administration (in 1915), and
arrived at every known variety of dog by
1919, before motor competition developed.
And the States which were not Bolshevik
faced motor competition with much less dis-
aster than Queensland experienced. An
effort was also made to show that other
States had gone an equally helter-skelter
pace in the loan market, which was not
worth arguing about. Some people can take
less drink than others, something depending
on what other, vices they take along with the
drink.
Small Sister’s Struggles for Solvency.
The Tas. Labor Government, forced to take
heroic measures to stop the drift of popu-
lation and encourage the establishment of
new industries in the island, has just done
something that no other Labor Government
has attempted—reduced taxation all round,
even taking something off the super-tax im-
posed on the big landowners by the previous
(Lee) Administration. Not that Treasurer
Lyons doesn’t want all the revenue he can
get, of course. Far from it. But as he
finds that he can square the ledger if the
Commonwealth Government keeps its word
in regard to the promised £375,000, and as a
country so over-taxed as Tasmania cannot
afford to indulge in the luxury of surpluses,
it is considered good policy to give the tax-
payers a little more inducement to stay in the
State and help pull her out of the doldrums.
Lyons will perhaps show a surplus for the
past financial year. If it is substantial,
further reductions in taxation may be
adumbrated. If a decrease of some £50,000
could be managed, the taxation of Tas-
manians would not exceed in severity that
of the average of their fellow-Australians in
the other States, and the island would then
probably be able to hold its population. New
industries are badly needed ; but to get them
some reduction in the tax on companies
must be made, even if the hole has to be
repaired with a special tax on unused or
inadequately used land. One of the finest
20,000-acre‘blocks of soil in the State, nine-
tenths of which could be very profitably culti-
vated, is held, and has been held for a couple
of generations, by an owner who allows no-
tiling but sheep and rabbits to walk across
bis estate, except a few trusted gillies and
shearers. Tasmania cannot afford to humor
this sort of landed proprietor.

The War on Coats.
The formation in Brisbane of a League of
Men pledged to throw off their coats —-not
because they have work to do that would
render coats conventionally inappropriate,
but because they feel that the coat, as a coat,
is a garment not ideally suited to the tem-
perature of Brisbane in the summer months
—is a portent. Possibly—even probably—
this Brisbane League will peter out, fizzle
or fall flat. But, though the end
may thus be inglorious, the endeavor merits
a word of praise. A League for Leav-
ing off Coats, even if it is based upon
the more or less specious excuse that the
climate has suddenly become too hot for
coats, is more than a league. It is what the
politicians, village and national, are always
telling people to beware of. It is the Thin
End of the Wedge. The coat is the key-
stone of the tailor’s art. He may cut your
pants so that they look as if you had ele-
phantiasis. He may make a simply rotten
vest. But if he cuts a good coat he is sure
of the applause of mankind. They will rush
to him, imploring him to make coats just
like the one lie made for Jones. Destroy
the coat as a fundamental article of male
attire, and you land the tailoring trade a
dirty one. Without coats to brood over and
flutter round and make silly little chalk-
marks all over, the tailor would become an
ordinary human being. Once the coat is gone
Man can go to the past—or the future—for
his attire. He can roam the world looking
for the outfit that takes least time to put
on and looks jauntiest when it gets there.
The Greeks, who put their heads into the
business and deferred, in matters of taste,
to men with names and reputations as long
as that of Praxiteles, found that a dainty
effect in book muslin, which would allow
one to show as much of a shapely calf or
bulky biceps as one would care to, was about
right for a warm climate. It didn’t require
a tailor. You just got a big square of the
stuff, and the wife hemmed it. If she loved
you to an extent that showed that she didn’t
know everything there was to be known about
you, she threw in a few extras in the way
of a hemstitch or a monogram. Then you
were set. You wore your garment every-
where, morning, noon and night. It took
two seconds to put on and ten minutes
to adjust, and at the end of the
day one just unwound it and had a good
night’s sleep. Prior to 1846, when Western
tailoring was forcibly introduced to the
notice of the Japanese, who were too weak-
minded to resist it, there existed on the
islands of Nippon a system of men’s cloth-
ing that had stood the test of many centuries.
The essence was a robe —not a coat —made
of silk and figured to suit the taste of the
wearer. It was cut on roomy lines and
fitted where it touched. It was tied round
the waist with a big silk sash. It was.like
a dressing-jacket, and one didn’t even have
to wear pyjamas underneath. If one had
a taste for a purple ground with orange
dragons, that was all there was about it. It
could be done at six prices, the lowest within
the reach of the most modest purse. Gilt
lions, scattered over a grove of cherry blos-
soms and bordered in jade green, might come
a bit higher—but the stuff would wash. It
beat the Greek notion hollow, because while
it took a good deal of cogitation to wear
a drape of muslin artistically, anyone could
throw on a kimono and look as well as any-
one could look in a kimono. Instead, in these
days and in this clime, a man is expected
to spend the hours of the day when he would
most prefer to sleep in adjusting to his body
about a dozen inartistic relics of an age when
discomfort and unsightliness were prized
above rubies by the entire male population
of Britain and the neighboring countries
of Europe—studs, buttons, braces, sock-
suspenders, leather boots and shoes, and the
like, the effect of which is enhanced by col-
lars that must have been invented by the
Devil. The Brisbane men who leave off
coats probably have no idea of how much
they are starting. Perhaps it is as well
that they don’t know. Their courage would
fail them at the prospect of the empire that
awaits conquest.

The Clarence River as a Deep-sea Port.
“ Noah ”: The report of Sir George
Buchanan, though it received but scant
attention in the city press, is creating
unprecedented enthusiasm on the N.S.W.
North Coast, and more particularly on the
Clarence River. For does not the report,
in its present preliminary shape, declare,
inter alia, the suitability of the Clarence for
deep-sea shipping? The first move for
definite action came from Maclean, a small
but prosperous town 12 miles from the mouth
of the river. Its chamber of commerce
passed resolutions to the effect (1) that a
convention of public bodies on the river meet
at a convenient date to discuss ways and
means of having the report acted upon, and
(2) that the members for the district bring
the report under the notice of the Premier
and ask him what steps the Government
intends to take in regard thereto. _ The
Grafton chamber also passed a motion in
favor of a convention. To this will .be
invited delegates from all over the North
Coast, and probably an agitation greater and
better organised than that for the New State
will eventuate. With the exception of Goff’s
Harbor, all the North appears to be
jubilant over the report. The Rich-
mond River press, whilst regretting that
Ballina was scheduled only as a port
“capable of development for coastal trade,”
takes the report resignedly, and seems
inclined to fall behind the people of the
Clarence in their move for the development
of the only port in the North recommended
as suitable for overseas trade. Coff's Harbor
is, of course, rather indignant at being
classed with the “coastal trade” ports, and
is likely to hold itself aloof. Once the
river-entrance difficulty is overcome, vast
developments should follow. Railways from
the whole northern part of New South Wales,
including the North-West, should be con-
structed to the port of shipment, which might
be Grafton, Maclean, Ashby or Iluka. Pri-
mary produce would be close to a deep-sea
Ad Absurdum.
“Mr. J. Barnett said his clients instructed him
to object to Mr. A. Davidson, J.P., adjudicating on
the grounds of bias. Mr. Davidson: ‘Why say that I
am biased?’ Mr. Barnett: ‘Because of your out-
spoken remarks on a previous occasion about being-
determined to put down the push nuisance in Colling-
wood.’ After a consultation on the Bench, Mr.
Conlon said Mr. Davidson would not adjudicate.”

As those of martyrs be;

The New Guinea Native Grows
Truculent.
“Morobe” : It would be difficult for those
familiar with the Mandated Territory in
pre-war days, or when it was under mili-
tary rule, to imagine the change which has
come over the natives during the last few
years in their attitude towards the white
man, a change of which the logical culmina-
tion was the recent tragedy at Nakanai,
when four prospectors lost their lives. Up
to the introduction of civil government, about
seven years back, the native population pre-
served a uniformly-respectful bearing to-
wards Europeans, and even in the uncon-
trolled districts the white man’s life and
property were comparatively safe. But no
longer does the native carry himself with
respect in the presence of
the white man. Instead,
he is sulky and given to
muttering, while remon-
strance for some short-
coming or dereliction of
duty is apt to produce open
insolence. Even more omi-
nous is the change towards
the white woman. Once
assaults and attacks on
European women, even in
the outlying districts, were
so rare as to be practically
non-existent, for the simple
reason that it had been in-
culcated in the mind of the
native that the European
woman stood on a plane so
infinitely superior to his
own that for him to even
think of her carnally was
an impiety terrifying to
the imagination. But there
have been so many assaults
and attempted assaults
and other happenings that
amongst the European
female population there is
now an ever-present fear.
It would not be easy to
pick out the exact causes
to which these changes are
to be ascribed. They may
have sprung directly from
the Bed poison stream
which has been flowing
down from Russia to the
furthermost corners of the
world. Or they may be
the natural reaction which
follows when a primitive
and inferior race, previ-
ously kept in strict subjec-
tion, finds the discipline
suddenly relaxed. Natu-
rally there are not wanting
eager critics who rush joy-
fully to point out that it
is all due to lack of capa-
city in Australians to
govern an inferior race
with efficiency, an accusa-
tion refuted by Papua,
under Commonwealth rule,
where the same native
races live under vastly dif-
ferent conditions. Perhaps
a factor in the state of
affairs is the circumstance that the peculiar
form of government under which the Terri-
tory is handled makes it possible for alien
outsiders with only a jealous interest in the
place to criticise its administration and to
secure an audience for their charges, especi-
ally when their allegations are concerned
with the ill-treatment of the natives, so that
a continual fear of such charges has led to
a disciplinary relaxation Avhich has produced
the present results.

The Farmer and Protection.
Dear Bulletin,—As you say (B. 4/11/’26),
Protection does not hurt the farmer in
U.S.A., where industry is accompanied by
high efficiency. But it is hurting him here,
and must do it so long as every saving is
passed on to the wage-worker through shorter
hours and higher pay. Payment by time
should be eliminated and payment by results
installed. That is the way the farmer is
paid, and the way of industrial efficiency
in the U.S.A. A larger local market is essen-
tial for the farmer, but not that alone.
Where lie produces more than is required
locally, say, butter, cheese, wheat, etc., his
local price is ruled by the world’s price.
Yhy should that be ? Does the bootmaker
or anyone else sell locally at the world's
price? There would be less outcry from the
countryman if he were treated as the local
manufacturer and his workmen are treated;
that is, given a local Australian price for all
his product consumed here. But Some of
the noisiest advocates of Protection, such as
the Age, are loudest in their cries against
the farmer when it sometimes happens that
his local price is higher than that ruling
overseas. Do they howl about the price of
boots, hats, etc., being higher? A thing
often overlooked is that we must export to
pay our interest bill and for the goods im-
ported that might be called essential imports.
These are paid for by the export of farmers’
produce only, or almost wholly. For the
nation’s good there must be an exportable
surplus of these products. How are we to
make sure of this surplus? Certainly not
by squeezing the primary producer out —and
we can do it by saying that the whole of

Queensland with sugar, bananas and maize
and is essential to the Murray Valley with its

facilities, better roads, better herds and
flocks, better transport, better means of com-
munication, such as ’phones and mails, lower
taxation, and greater efficiency in our manu-
facturing industries so as to ensure lower
prices. The necessary exportable surplus of

the loss on them lower; and that will enable

is less likely to be the plaything of political

“Sixenate” : An obdurate woman has just
been dealt with by the Law as the Law
nearly always deals with the woman who is
obdurate enough. A publican and his wife
nuarrelled, and the wife made off with £6OO
which happened to be on the premises, claim-
ing that it was as much her money as liis.
The same thing appears to have happened
before; this time the husband laid a charge
of stealing against his wife, who was found
guilty in spite of much hysterics. The em-
barrassed Law sought a way out by suggest-
ing that nothing more would be done if the
cash was returned; but the woman, when
asked what had become of the cash, told the
Law, in effect, to mind its own business.
More embarrassed than ever, it shamefacedly
remanded the lady for a week, hoping that
a week’s contemplation of prison-life from
the not very hard position of a remand case
would frighten her into submission; but she
was as obdurate as ever when again pre-
sented to the Court. The Law then swallowed
hard and tried to put sternness into the
manner in which it sentenced the woman to
nine days and ordered her to return £5OO
(the biggest amount the Court could award)
out of the money she had Then it
added, hurriedly, that the days she had already
spent in prison would be taken as covering
file term of _ the sentence. So the money
becomes a civil debt; but if the husband
likes to be hard-—the cowardly Law has
pushed the initiative on to him —the woman
is liable to go to gaol if she doesn’t pay, not
for the debt, but for contempt of court. She
can get out immediately, however, by going
bankrupt. A man who displayed a similar
obduracy would be dealt with severely; the
case affords a good example of the liberties
a woman can take. Probably it is because
some get so much more than justice that
others are condemned to get so much less.
A recent return by the Defence Department
shows that for the year ended June 20 last
one-third of the senior cadets examined for
admission to the C.M.F. were “unfit,” while
25 p.c. of the trainees for the cadets were
also passed out. The drift to the cities, of
which we hear so much, can have little to
do with this, for in Australia the metro-
politan youngster is little handicapped by his
city life in comparison with his rural brother.
To the outward eye there seems little wrong
with youthful physique, and 90 per cent,
of cadets and Citizen Force candidates are
open-air and game-playing youths. The
Director-General of Medical Services has
announced that no reason can be given till
the causes of rejection are stated in the
examining medicoes’ returns. This has not
been done in the past—which seems an extra-
ordinary state of things—but will be done in
future, when an analysis of the causes of
unfitness can be made. Had this very neces-
sary step been taken from the beginning, the
Defence Departement, and others concerned,
would have had years of valuable data to
work upon. As it is, there is good reason
to believe that a big proportion of rejects
would never have been thrown out if the
examiners had been required to certify to
the specific reason—if any such existed.
“Whizbang”: The murder of four white
men in the Nakanai district of Talasca, New
Britain, is not an isolated instance of mas-
sacre in that island. In 1904, at St. Paul’s
Roman Catholic Mission, in the Baining dis-
trict. which is situated some hundred miles
nearer to Rabaul than Nakanai, nine mis-
sionaries (three priests and two brothers and
four nuns) were set upon by their own con-
verts, and butchered in a systematic and
brutal manner. A few years prior to that, at
Paperatava, near Toma, which is only 28
miles from Rabaul, Kanakas entered the
home of a German named Wolfe, who at
the time was absent, and murdered his wife
and child. They also attempted to kill her
companion, a young girl, who was staying
with her at the time; she, however, though
struck with an axe, was not seriously hurt,
and managed to escape. Both these inci-
dents were followed by sharp reprisals on
the part of the German Government. The
Germans may have been severe, but they
were just, and certainly did not employ
grandmotherly methods in dealing with
native murderers. Unless a proper example
is made of the tribe responsible for the kill-
ing of these four Australians, all of whom
are ex-service men, it won’t be long before
something similar occurs again.
Brisbane’s Water Board, looking far ahead,
recently asked the Government to give it
control of the Little Nerang watershed, with
a view to supplying all the coastal towns
from Brisbane to the N. S. Wales border.
This aroused a storm of protest from rural
councils, land-agents and others. They
declared that the board had more water than
it knew what to do with, and petitioned the
Government to refuse the request. Then the
Brisbane River and its tributaries ceased
running in the present catchment area, and
the board had to draw on its reserve in Lake
Manchester. This certainly is a large reserve
—5,800,000,000 gallons; enough to supply
all Brisbane’s requirements for nine months
at the present rate of consumption—but the
failure of the usual source of supply is a
strong argument in favor of the board’s re-
quest for an additional catchment area.

Those interested in the Australian beef
industry will get cold comfort from a recent
article on the subject in the Cold Storage
and Produce Review, a London publication
of some tonnage in its own line. Referring
to experimental shipments of chilled beef
from Australia, the journal doubts whether
this country has a hope of competing with
the Argentine, even with preference in Army
and Navy contracts thrown in. Not only
does Australia suffer from her own neglect in
breeding methods, treatment and transport,
but she would be unable to face the organisa-
tion of the South American interests.
“Everyone knows that the Argentine powers
that be, and they are many, could easily
quash such new competition, supposing it
were practicable. To do that would be
merely an ordinary step of commercial self-
protection”—a casual but significant hint.
The Review’s summing-up of the situation
is impartial enough, according to its lights,
but less blame lies on the stock-raiser for
poor-quality herds than on Government-
imposed handicaps. In Queensland, greatest
of all the beef-raising Australian States,
madhouse rentals, taxation, restrictions and
labor conditions have made high-class beef-
herd production an impossibility at world’s
parity prices, and what is true of Queens-
land applies more or less to the industry in
the other States.
O
“Exul” : About 60 out of every 100,000
persons in Australia die in a year from
tuberculosis of the lungs, and 60 per cent,
of those born become infected with t.b. at
some time m their lives, generally in child-
hood. Obviously the .great majority recover
from this early attack, which is believed to
confer an immunity that protects the indi-
vidual from infection during the rest of his
life; and the development of the disease in
lacer years is probably due either to a flar-
ing-up of the original infection or to an
insufficient immunity produced against sub-
sequent infection by the first attack. Dr.
Calmette, of Paris, has perfected a method
of prophylaxis which aims at producing a
high immunity in infancy by feeding babies
born in tuberculous surroundings with a
culture of tubercle bacilli which, while
retaining its immunising properties, has by
its mode of growth been rendered incapable
of causing disease, its harmlesness being
proved by extended experiments on calves,
which are very susceptible animals. In
Paris one out of four babies that live with
their tuberculous mothers dies of t.b. in its
first year. In 1922 Calmette gave his
culture to 178 of these infants. So far none
of them has died of t.b. or appears to be
infected with it. Fifteen of them died from
other diseases, giving a mortality of 8.4 per
cent., whereas the average mortality for all
French infants in their first year is 121 per
cent. The_ Commonwealth serum laboratories
have obtained cultures from Calmette, and
soon the benefits of the treatment will be
available for young Australia.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Lang’s friends can justly claim that N. S.
Wales has never had a Treasurer like him.
In 1920-21, his first year, he raised the.
income-tax all round (the lowest increase
was 3d. in the fl and the highest Is. 3d.),
added 16 2-5 p.c. to railway freight-rates and
fares, imposed new stamp, probate and bet-
ting taxes, and finished with a deficit of
£445,400. Next year he said he would need
another two millions of revenue, and, as the
1920- income-tax increases had brought in
£2,091,000, doubling them would do the busi-
ness as regards 1921-22. A change of Gov-
ernment frustrated the plan; his deficit that
year was £1,328,700. Returning to the job
in 1925-26, the extraordinary person predicted
a surplus of £13,600, and produced instead a
debit balance of £1,274,300. His loan ex-
penditure that year was £11,278,000; in
1921- it was £10.442,000 and in 1920-21
£14,701,000. For 1926-27 he announced an-
other lot of increased railway charges and a
tax on publications. Then, as in 1921-22,
Nemesis intervened.
Unless Peter Ffrench Loughlin weakens,
N. S. Wales is to have a general election
in the newly-plotted single constituencies
in March or April. Resigning from the Min-
istry because of (1) the dictatorship granted
to the Premier by the Labor Conference, and
(2) the anti-country features of Lang’s
Budget, Loughlin was joined by Gillies and
Goodin, two country Labor M’s.L.A. The
trio helped the Opposition to carry a motion
for the suspension of the standing orders
against the Government, and delivered anti-
Lang speeches on the no-confidence motion
that immediately followed; but when the
division was taken they were missing, _ having
arranged to let the Government stay in office
conditionally on its dropping the publica-
tions tax and other putrid Budget proposals
and face the electors within four months.
So the Government will have a summer
funeral —if the new Country Labor party
doesn’t perish in the meantime.
Boorish in adversity as in prosperity,
N.S.W. Premier Lang called the Opposition
leader, in effect, a liar and a coward because
Bavin, quite correctly, had moved for the
suspension of the standing orders without
lodging an indictment against the Govern-
ment. Lang’s bad manner has contributed
largely to his undoing—that and his habit
of searching in the gutter for motives to
explain the attitude of men _ guilty of the
unpardonable crime of differing from him.
Not by being chronically suspicious and
nearly always in a temper has Collier made
good in Westralia and Lyons in Tasmania.
Tiiose Labor Premiers have succeeded, and
won generous tributes from people who have
no love for Labor politics, where Lang has
egregiously failed.
When the present King came to the
throne his title was declared to be ‘‘George
V., by the grace of God of the United King-
dom of Great Britain and Ireland and of
the British Dominions beyond the seas King,
Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India.”
One of the “epoch-marking” changes pro-
posed by the Imperial Conference is the
striking-out of the words “of the United
Kingdom,” owing to the altered state of things
in Ireland. But if perfect accuracy is aimed
at they ought to make it “George V
King of Great Britain and Defender of the
Faith therein, King of Ireland and the Brit-
ish Dominions beyond the seas, Emperor of
India.” The words “Defender of the Faith”
should be applied only to the country in
which the head of the House of Windsor is
also head of the Church. Head of the Church
in Australia, for instance, he is not.
Another of the Prime Minister’s luncheon
boosts was lately cabled out:—
Australia is the brightest star in the British
crown. We have the greatest uninhabited country in
the world suitable for settlement. We have resources
of which no man has the faintest conception....
My one satisfaction has been to see the increasing
realisation by our Australian people of their great
responsibilities and opportunities.
Granting that Bruce knows all about the
resources of which no man has the faintest
conception, there remains a doubt concerning
“the increasing realisation by our Australian
people of their great responsibilities.’’ Said
responsibilities increased lately by 45 millions
in one year, and nobody seemed to realise it
any more than a blind puppy.
SET.
“The Vic. Allan-Peacock Government, though three times defeated last week, refuses to resign
until it has passed some necessary legislation.”
ALLAN: “Bring me some more bats, Alick; I'm not going out until I hit the ball.”
Short shrift was given hy Vic. Assembly
to the redistribution-of-seats scheme. The
thing did not suit Pennington and Gordon
(Nashers), Weaver (Cocky), Dunstan (ex-
Cocky) and McLachlan (Ind.), so they
joined with 28 Baborites to toss it out. Even
if Michael, the archangel, had been co-
opted by the Commission as a member, no-
thing it could have produced would have
satisfied Labor, which, while pretending to
want a 30-city-30-country plan, really desires
the present out-of-date electorates, with its
Hogan representing 5000 electors in Warren-
heip, while Greenwood (Nash.) has about
75,000 in Boroondara. Under Sec. 9 of the
Seats Act, 1926, Chief Sec. Argyle has
referred the scheme back to the Commission
(Gilder, Molloy and Peverill) for revision.
Pennington and Weaver have pledged them-
selves to accept whatever changes may be
made.
Thanks to the “No” vote at the last refer-
endum, the Federal and N.S.W. Industrial
Courts continue to fall over each other’s feet
with expensive results. State Commissioner
Piddington recently refused registration to
the Permanent and Casual Wharf-laborers’
Union, which dates from the 1917 strike.
Now, however, they have been granted regis-
tration under the Commonwealth Arbitration
Court; and to show its displeasure the old
Wharfies’ Federation has resorted to the
familiar “overtime” strike, which will be
extended when the opportunity arrives.
In Queensland nowadays the boss must
have a union ticket before he can work in
his own business—and he may reckon him-
self darned lucky if he gets it. The Board
of Trade recently debated whether a part-
owner was eligible. It was a mining case,
the man being one of six partners in a small
mine. The union contended that he and his
mates were not eligible for employment on
the mine, as preference to unionists had been
granted, and they were not unionists. (Inci-
dentally, the union had refused to issue
tickets to them, on the ground that they
were not workers in the industry!) W. J.
Dunstan, who was on the bench, ruled that
the union should issue a ticket in this case,
but left unsettled the question whether a
man may be permitted to work for himself
without joining the union.
Uncle Sam might easily have driven a
much harder bargain with Theodore than he
did when that Queensland Labor Premier
was frozen out of the London market in
1921. McCormack, Theodore’s successor, had
to find only £102.705 for his American sink-
ing fund last year, although Uncle lent about
£4,500,000. If, instead of merely telling us
that we are drifting towards the edge,
Father Bull would follow Uncle’s example
and insist upon a substantial sinking fund
with every loan, he would do us a real
service.
The A.W.U.’s application to the Queens-
land Board of Trade for a special award
for rural workers has some remarkable
features. A 44-hour week, overtime at time
and a half, double pay for Sundays and
holidays, and annual leave are demanded,
together with wages of £3 10s. a week and
keep, soaring to £5 for cotton-pickers and
harvest hands. The employers are to pro-
vide free accommodation, free light, free
travel, free clothing (for prickly-pear cut-
ters), free tools and implements and free
disinfectants, as well as free food and drink.
Everything the compilers could think of was
put in the claim. The only thing they forgot
was the drought.
Queensland’s queer progress in land settle-
ment is shown in stimulating fashion by these
figures, compiled by Arthur Moore, the
Opposition Leader: —
Selected (under freehold), 1914 .. 538,884 acres
Rental, £12,625 p.a.
Selected (under leasehold), 1925 .. 366,952 acres
Rental £10,576 p.a.
“Under your hampering system,” cried
Moore, pointing a scornful finger at
McCormack’s Lands Minister Dunstan, “the
unfortunate selector has to pay an average
annual rent of 6.92 d. per acre, as against
5.62 d. per acre when this Government came
into office. So you see that under your lease-
hold system the man on the land has to pay
a greater rent per acre for an asset which
is not realisable. And then you wonder why
land-settlement is going back!”
The N. S. Wales Supreme Court Judges
have been grappling with one of the problems
arising out of the multiplicity of divorce
laws. A Kalgoorlie wife, suing in Perth,
was granted a judicial decree of separation
on the ground of wilful desertion. Coming
to the Ma State, the husband, after some
years, brought proceedings for restitution of
conjugal rights as a preliminary to divorce,
and Owen, J., ruled that he was entitled to
succeed, as the separation decree “could have
no force or authority outside Westralia.” The
State Full Court upset this verdict, the C.J.
and Gordon, J., deciding that the decree
was binding on the parties wherever they
might be; Ferguson, J., however, was of the
same mind as Brother Owen, so it was two
against two. It is a case that shrieks for a
Federal divorce law.
A Chinaman smuggled into the country.
Somebody discovered him, and, the dictation
test being put to him, he failed. A magis-
trate convicted him as a prohibited immi-
grant, but the Westralian Full Court set
aside the conviction. The High Court has
now had the last word, the majority judg-
ment declaring that the safety of the White
Australian principle is involved in the power
to interrogate an immigrant at any time
even if he evades the test at the time of his
arrival; and it was considered that the
Commonwealth has the power. The Noes
were the Chief Justice and learned brother
Duffy ; the other five said Yes.
Mayor Jolly, of Brisbane, holds the simple
faith that a municipality should pay its way.
The 20 local authorities now absorbed in
Greater Brisbane had a different belief. In
their last year they “made a welter of it”
(as one alderman confessed frankly), deliber-
ately rating for much less than their require-
ments, and so piling up a debit balance of
well over £500,000 for Greater Brisbane to
take over. Greater Brisbane is spending a
little less than the old local bodies, but when
the Mayor had the antiquated valuations
revised and announced that he intended to
rate for the full expenditure required, infuri-
ated ratepayers held mass-meetings to pro-
test against a dangerous innovation. Jolly
took a trip to Melbourne to recuperate, but
shows no disposition to give way.
Queensland and Westralia continue to lead
the other States in the development of avia-
tion. The Federal Government is lending
a hand, and has bought an area at Too-
woomba as a landing-ground for the Queens-
land and N.T. Air Service Co., which has
made such a success in commercial aviation.
Hitherto “Quantas” has run a north and
south route up and down Central Queens-
land, from Cunnamulla to Cloncurry. The
Toowoomba landing-ground marks the link-
ing up of Brisbane with the inland trunk
line. Before long the service will be extended
from Cloncurry to the Gulf; an aerodrome
is being laid out at Normanton. The exten-
sion of the service to the Gulf will be a god-
send to one of the most isolated spots in
Australia.
The N.S.W. Slang Government’s Budget
was the kind of entertainment which hasn’t
one dull moment. The revenue showed a
decline for the first time since 1911. It was
a fall of only £173,588, but a Government
which has made so much prosperity should
be above such a thing. The deficit was the
tenth in 18 years, and the one for 1926-27
will be the eleventh. This is the recent list
of shortages:—
1909 .. £1,039,246 | 1920 .. £1,559,517
1911 . , 588.202 1 1921 . . 445,496
1912 . . 340,143 I 1922 .. 1.328,705
1913 . . 1,288,380 | 1925 .. 756,450
1917 . . 268,798 I 1926 . . 1,274,30(1
The biggest surplus in the same period was
the £803,508 produced by the Fuller Govern-
ment in 1923, and the next best was £430,048
in 1915. All the huge deficits arrived in
peace time, and they have nothing to do with
rise or fall of revenue, for in 1920 the
receipts were £5,202.000 more than in 1919,
and the deficit was heroic. There is no steadi-
ness or continuity about the Ma State’s
rotten finance. It comes and goes like a
Haytian revolution, and is more worthy of
niggers than white men.

The society celebrated its jubilee year by
smashing every record on the premises. In-
deed, not content with this wholesale break-
age of office figures, the directors claim that
the new business completed—an aggregate of
139,607 policies assuring £10,471,322 —is the
greatest, ever registered by an Australasian
co. in its 50th year, notwithstanding that
the T. and G. writes business only in Aus-
tralia and Maoriland. Premium income for
the term was £2,185,317, and total income
£2,701,156, the latter being £285,959 greater
than the 1925 figures. Total funds increased
by almost 1J million to £9,902,957. A
graphic illustration of the remarkable growth
is afforded by a comparison with 1906: in
that year combined funds amounted to
£563,789. Greater vigor has come with the
years. Since 1920, income, both Ordinary
and Industrial, has more than doubled.
Sturdy progress in business totals is to be
expected in view of changed and changing
economic conditions under which the pur-
chasing power of money has shrunk. There
is a fairly general recognition of the fact
that cover taken out in 1914 or earlier is
not now adequate for the same necessities.
Thus last year the average Ordinary policy
was for £230 compared with £lO6 in 1913 —
the full year immediately prior to the war.
Record figures have to be read with those
altered conditions in mind. But the T. and
G. most decidedly has outpaced those develop-
ments.
And it has won the right to a word of
praise for having achieved its results at an
expenditure which has been steadily lowered :

In the Ordinary branch, on the basis that
renewals cost 7 p.e., the new business was
won at a cost of 78 p.e.—the same as the
two preceding terms. The Industrial per-
formance was even better—the rate was the
lowest in the history of the department. And
the renewals bear witness to the fact that
a very good proportion of the business sticks.
After making the usual conservative valua-
tions, the society’s actuary disclosed a record
surplus of £336,304 —£231.980 in the Ordi-
nary and £104,324 in the Industrial, of which
£223,446 and £98,893 respectively will be
absorbed in tlie specially generous bonuses
granted on this occasion. Besides tlie 2s. per
£lOO special addition on Ordinary policies,
fully-paid-up policies free of all future pay-
ments are granted to policy-holders of 80
years or over, and a special bonus is paid to
old Industrial policy-holders. Bonuses, of
course, have progressed with other figures;
and in response to the same influences.

In each department endowments matured
were responsible for the major portion of the
increase. In the Ordinary, death claims
accounted for £88,554 and endowments
matured £104,262, while in the Industrial
£117,780 was paid for death and £229,701
for endowments. The rates, however, are
still far below the percentages on which the
premiums are calculated.
The interest rate notched a new record by
an increase of Is. Id. —particularly good in
view of the heavy percentage of funds in

In a balance-sheet of big figures the society’s

impression. These are in at £873,793 —a mod-
erate value considering the letting space
in the various offices. Full benefit was
obtained from the recently-erected sky-
scrapers in Brisbane and Adelaide, and con-
tracts have been let for the construction of
a new head office in Melbourne and a chief
office in Wellington (M.L.). All the sites
were purchased when land values were much
lower than they are to-day.

There was decided improvement during the
12 months, and it is little wonder that the
market, sniffing out the fact towards the
end of the company’s year, conjured up
visions of something over and above the 10
p.e. Between 1910 and 1915 £887,500 was
handed out in gift shares, including the
550,000 prefs. (6 p.e. partic.), of which all
but 100 have been converted into ords. in
the past two years.
The fact that there has been no distribution
of largesse for such a long time apparently
inspired the hope that something would
be done along the old lines. Shares rose
from 365. 4d. in August to 40s. 3d. in Sep-
tember, but fell back to 38s. Gd. in October;
latest sales (ex. div.) were at 37 s. 6d.
Tooth’s certainly has done remarkably well
of late, and there is every indication that it
will do much better. It must not be for-
gotten, however, that conditions have changed
vastly in the past 15 years. More contin-
gencies nowadays demand provision, and
numerous troublesome possibilities have to be
remembered when striking the net return for
the year. The Dry Army, for instance,
although quiet at the moment, is always
likely to provoke a fine scrap at short notice,
and hungry Governments are on the alert
for any chance of increasing taxation.
Tooth’s keen management knows as much
about the storms and when they will develop
as most, and it casts a cautious eye in
every direction when balancing-time arrives.
Visible reserves at September 30, 1925, were
lower than they were in 1912, and even the
£565,429 which represented the accumulated
surplus after payment of the latest div. was
not relatively the co.’s best. Last year's
lay-by, however, was the largest recorded.
Although capital was only a few thousands
greater at £3.108,000, the money raised late,
in tue 1925 term was last year at work for
the full 12 months. Still, allowing for the
larger average capital, last year’s net result
was remarkably good ; so good that the direc-
tors brought £129,431 more into view T than
was necessary for the 10 p.c. divs.
Gross profits showed a healthy increase:—
Profit on Management,
Brewings, Wages, Balance
Interest, etc. Excise, etc. of Profit.
1915 .. £052,360 £367,566 £284,794

1926 . . 1,032,200 591,971 440,229
Most of that came from trading, for the hold-
ing of investments was but £150,000 greater.
It is fairly obvious, too, that the purchase
of the businesses of Mahon and Headley, of
Wagga, and Lincoln and Co., of Narrandera,
has been justified by results.
The next comparisons show up well,
though the increase in not assets is partly
due to increase of capital:—
Assets — 1924. 1925. 1926.
Breweries, etc.. £2,218,909 £2,426,241 £2,548,527

Net assets . . £3,037,840 £3,765,732 £3,908,058
Purchase of freeholds continues. It is
an expensive process, but keen competition
lias made it necessary. In rising or growing
centres the increment in values is likely to
offset the high price that has to hi' paid for
licensed properties. In the metropolis many
of the city freeholds are more valuable for
shop purposes than as pubs—a fact which
makes the chief assets item more pleasing
to the eye. Brewing to-day is an expensive
process, and the huge money which has been
put into plant has demanded a proportionate
outlay on property in order to ensure a con-
sistent market and an adequate return on
capital. Tooth’s secured a grip of the
Newcastle-Maitland district and of the
Riverina by its absorption of the cos. operating
in those areas. Overhead must be decreasing
as turnover increases and business is more
and more handled from headquarters with its
last word in plant and technique. The 10
p.c. was a simple matter last year, and there
is little likelihood of the rate being disturbed
—unless it be for the better. Assets at their
book value are worth about 245. per share;
what the invisible assets are worth can only
be guessed at.

A glance at the table suggests that the co.
lias been going downhill with the brakes
off. This is a case, however, where the
investor cannot expect to see material assets
worth 20s. for every £ he has put up. At
.Tune 30 shareholders had subscribed £582,061
in 181.400 fully-paid shares and 802,738 paid
to 10s., less £707 calls in arrears. Three
shillings was called up during the term. Of
the capital, £93,000 is represented by patent
rights and £174,541 (£54,592 increase) by
“expenditure to date on establishment of
new services.” (There is a reserve for
“patents, depreciation, insurance, etc.”—
£73,984 —but a true analysis of that is im-
possible.) It is doubtful whether you could
actually lay hands on a ha’p’orth of that
lot. And yet research, experiment and inven-
tion are vital. What was won for share-
holders in earlier years—little enough, it is
true, but that was due largely to Government
control of wireless during the war—was
won because of the patents and research.
And the co.’s future will be governed by
the same factors. Balance-sheet figures
compare:—
1921. 1923. 1925. 1926.
Sundry creditors. £24,934 £30,842 £59,211 £102,736

War Bonds, cash,
etc 15,920 12,529 36,799 61,543
Shares other cos. 30.007 12,352 9,952
In addition to the intangibles there was also
a p. and 1. debit at June 30 of £4186. How-
ever, deducting the creditor items, the tan-
gibles represented 13s. 2d. for each £1 o
capital. But the co. does not stand or fa
on those figures. Indeed, if the intangible
patents and the experiments and reseaicii
are worth nothing, then the existing Pfant
which is the outcome might be worth little
more. Wireless is the co.'s chief activity,
but there is a subsidiary—Australectnc, Ltd.,
formed in April, 1921 —which concentrates
chiefly on the general electric side ot the
business. It showed a trading loss last yeai
of £2400, but the directors offer no word ot
explanation. At least that side of the busi-
ness should be looking up, inasmuch as the
parent co. apparently carries the cost of all
research, experiment and establishment.
Much is expected from the beam stations
which the co. has fought for and finally
established. They are to be opened at an
early date, and will provide a service between
Australia and England and Australia and
North America. The new development in
communication may represent the profit-
maker which shareholders have awaited.
Thus far the co. has given far more than
it has received. From the beginning there
has been little in it for shareholders, due
largely, as already mentioned, to the Com-
monwealth’s control of wireless during the
war years. Later, when that factor lost its
importance, other developments, in which the
Commonwealth again was the main trouble,
interfered with profit-making. The fact
that the Federal Government is now inter-
ested—it holds 500,001 of the million shares
—should remove that source of trouble. In
13 years shareholders have averaged ?>\ p.c.,
but the past four have been completely dry.
In the past two years ss. 6d. has been
called up, and money is still coming in. Sub-
stantial earnings will be necessary to feed
the big capital and make some amends for
the thin time shareholders have had. The
market is not troubled greatly about the
assets position, and it thinks the outlook
will brighten. Recent sales of both classes
of shares have been at equivalent prices:
fully-paids-at 17s. 6d., contribs. (now paid
to 125.) at 9s. 6d.

The Langridge pulled through the smashes
of the ’nineties without reconstructing—it
paid 20s. in the £ —and then pursued a policy
of modest divs. and attention to reserves. The
result is the present comfortable position,
which makes a slightly better distribution
possible whenever the careful board considers
the time opportune. Deposits have decreased
considerably of recent years; the manage-
ment refused to raise interest rates, though
other offices were driven to it. Smaller
deposits have meant lessened risks, but profit-
making has been limited thereby. The society
has been drawing on its bankers of late,
£4369 being marked from that source at
September 30. There would be little margin
in that. Movements have been slow:—

Consolidated Motors, Ltd., is being
floated to take over the N.S.W. agencies for
Chandler, F.I.A.T. and Peugeot cars and
F.I.A.T. trucks, and to acquire certain rights
in connection with the Jowett car agency.
Capital is £500,000 in £1 shares; 50,000
10 p.c. cum. prefs., payable 10s. each appli-
cation and allotment; 150,000 ords., 16,000
fully-paids to vendors; 284,000 reserved.
The directors consider that it wall be neces-
sary to call up only 10s. on the ords. Of
the reserved shares, 20,000 are to be held
for issue at par to the co.’s agents, and the
directors have a three-years’ option over
35,000 at par. Vendors get £3750 in addi-
tion to the 16,000 shares, but that considera-
tion covers underwriting charges on 50,000
ords. taken by Roland C. Clark. The
F.I.A.T. is a particularly valuable agency,
the Chandler and Peugeot may be made so,
and a little will come to the co. from the
rights in the Jowett. Management, busi-
ness and technical, appears to be in
thoroughly efficient hands, and the co. starts

As well as being the most practical conduit for
large water-supply schemes, Pioneer Wood Pipe is
ideal for conveying water from distant springs,
tanks, reservoirs and other sources to isolated resi-
dences and farm buildings. It can be equipped with
valves and fittings to make a complete system, which
will give positively no trouble while kept saturated.
Its smooth interior bore cannot become coated with

of pref. divs., the balance would be equal

Gould MacDougall makes some further
comment: —
“Mining Engineer,” in continuing to protest about
the tin “boom” (Wild Cat, 11/11/’26) and high
prices of tin shares generally is arguing on a
point that is not in dispute. My reply is that his
criticism of particular stocks is unsound and unsup-
ported by facts.
“M.E.’s” remarks concerning the Alluvial Tin pro-
perties in the Kinta Valley were undoubtedly intended
to discredit Malcolm Newman’s report as to deep
ground. As he now admits that Mr. Bethune and
the “old hands” did not bore the whole of the
valley, presumably they did not bore the deep sec-
tions which comprise the Alluvial Tin areas.
Discredited on his argument as to depth at Malim
Nawar South, “M.E.” now reminds us that the dredge
during October recovered only 13 tons, which recov-
ery “it is to be hoped will improve,” As the Malim
Nawar Soutn dredge is one of the largest operating
in Malaya and must work on a very big face, early
progress is necessarily slow, and it is not expected
that bottom will be reached before December, though
payable returns are already being obtained.
“M.E.” states that the Malim Nawar dredge “has
been working nearly 12 months.” Either the co.’s
official reports are wrong or “M.E.” is floundering
again, for the dredge was reported to have started
during May last. Dredging operations had to be
suspended before bottom was reached to enable
additions to the pontoon to restore bouyancy for
deep dredging. “M.E.” should know that good tin
recoveries cannot be expected before a dredge has
bottomed.
I agree that the market prices of Selayang shares
are far too high when all the facts are taken into
consideration, but “M.E.” would be well advised to
make inquiries regarding the company’s latest check
boring reports before discussing Newman’s valuation.
“M.E.” accuses me as “a theorist who works on
prospectus, estimates.” Perhaps so. But only on
prospectuses endorsed by such names as J. Malcolm
Newman, B.E. (Syd.), Ambrose Freeman, B.E.
(Syd.), Major E. N. Mulligan, D. 5.0., B.E (Syd.),
H. V. Stanley, 8.E., and E. White, B.E. An estimate
of 40 tons monthly endorsed by any of the names I
have mentioned must, I submit, be taken as 40 tons,
and not, as “M.E.” suggests, reduced to 30 tons.
I am not personally qualified to discuss with a
mining engineer the capacity of modern bucket
dredges, but I would like “M.E.” to tell me why he
reduced the engineers’ estimated yardage of the
Kundang dredge from 120,000 to 90,000 c. yds. Is
it not a fact that the old Kampong and Larut
dredges, designed in 1913, have averaged over 80,000
c. yds. monthly ? During the last 13 years of
engineering achievement has the bucket dredge made
no advance ? The Takuapa dredge is treating up
to 150,000' c. yds. monthly. A dredge of practically
the same design and capacity as that of Kundang
is being built for Bundi by the same engineering
firm, and is guaranteed to treat at least 144,000
c. yds. monthly. The engineers who estimated
the yardage of the Kundang dredge presum-
ably should know their business and allow for all
reasonable contingencies. Yet “M.E.” claims that
these estimates should be cut down a further 25 p.c.
as a matter of course. Why? If 25 p.c. why not
75 p.c? For they either know their business or
they don’t.

From Fergus F. Munro, junior, of Haad
Yai Tin:—
Isaac Boadle’s three assertions re Haad Yai Tin
(B. 11/11/’26) are: (1) That the property was
worked out at least 80 years ago; (2) that the
property contains only 35 acres of virgin ground
averaging lib. for six feet depth at the up-stream
end, and 30 feet at the down-stream end; (3) that
the property is waterless in the dry season. I will
deal with them seriatim.
(1) There is an open cast mine on the property
which was opened two years ago, and was producing
12 tons a month until the property was acquired by
the Malay Siamese Prospecting Co. Mr. Boadle him-
self took nine face samples from the mine during
his boring operations.
(2) This allegation is absolutely discredited by
Mr. Boadle’s own chart and report (documents in
the co.’s office at Taiping), in which he states that
he bored 233 acres, found an average depth of 16.8
feet and an average tin content of 1.071 b. of tin
oxide.
(3) This is answered by the Haad Yai prospectus,
which states: “Water rights have been granted by
the Siamese Government to take 1000 c.f. of water
per minute from the Klong River, which flows about
a mile distant to the south of the mine”.... The
Klong Wat affords a permanent supply of water, and
the rights that have been obtained will insure a
sufficient supply to the mine at all times.
The property was bored after Mr. Boadle by Messrs.
Pasley and Hastings, and, later, check-bored by
Messrs. King and Cundy, and each in turn en-
countered the false bottom which so completely
deceived Mr. Boadle, pierced it and found rich values
below. (An enclosed letter from Lee Eng Siang,
one of the largest shareholder in the co., con-
firms the co.’s statement.) Mr. Pasley is one of
the leading borers in the East, and is particularly
well known in connection with the check-boring of
Austral Siam Tin of London. The opinion ventured
that H. V. Seale would presumably decide “who
is right about Haad Yai” was entirely unfounded.
No doubt exists in the mind of the directors regard-
ing the value of the property, viz., 511 acres of
average depth of 26.5 ft. containing an average value
of 1.271 b. of oxide to the cubic yard, assaying 74
per cent, metallic tin.
* * * *
The boom in Malayan tin flotations hav-
ing shown signs of ebbing, more than one
group of shows is beginning to realise how
sweet are the uses of amalgamation. A
notable instance is the proposed registration
of Larut Tin Fields, Ltd., with a capital of
£600,000 in £1 shares. The new concern
will swallow up Kota, Larut, Tupai and
Settlements. The shares in Settlements are
owned by Tupai and Kota. The basis will
be: Larut, 255. per share, £125,000; Tupai,
525. 6d. per share, £262,000 ; Kota, 425. 6d.
per share, £212,000. Shares in the amalgama-
tion will amount to 14 for each Larut share,
2§ for Tupai, and 24 for Kota. It is hoped
that the amalgamation will reduce costs,
quicken up dredging operations, and provide
sufficient yardage to justify the installation
of a fifth dredge. It is expected that the
four dredges now working can recover 90
tons of tin oxide a month, and a new dredge
would increase monthly yardage from
340,000 c.yds. to 400,000. The new co. pro-
poses to take over as from .Tan. 1, 1927.
There is £86,000 in cash and Government
securities among the assets.
* * * *
Devon (W.A.), in making another call,
tells shareholders that everything is looking
bright, and that the manager is confident
that the mine will pay well. But the co.
has issued so many favorable reports that
shareholders’ optimism has gone down to
less than a trace to the ton.
* * * e
Jack McDermott, option-holder of Glenelg
Queen at Glenelg Hills (W.A.), followed
the treatment of 12 tons of ore for a yield
of Boz. per ton with two vertical shafts set
to cut the reef at a depth of about 60ft. One
shaft has already exposed the reef, but there
has been no announcement regarding its
width and value. Since the discovery of
the Queen, three months ago, prospectors
have been arriving at Glenelg, and most of
these are testing the country south of that
centre. The Mines Department might do
worse than expend some cash from the mines
development vote in clearing a track and in
cleaning out and enlarging southern rock-
water holes. Just now prospectors are in
the mood to try the south country, but it
is extremely dry and rough travelling.

“Old Un”: What a funny blow-out over
South Australian Oil Wells! One set of
geologists throwing bricks at comrade Barag-
wanath in a way which isn’t usual in scien-
tific circles; the Stock Exchange com-
mittee of Melbourne, in high-toned virtue,
slamming the call-room door on the co.’s
shares, but letting dealing flourish on the
doorstep; the co.’s office stormed by losers
over the fall in shares; directors protest-
ing louder than ever their faith in Charlton
Dod and Lyne and their disbelief in Barag-
wanath; he responding that he wished the
show was in Victoria. His implication is
what? When every scrap of scum sent to
the Mines Department is washed clean there
isn’t more oil than would decently stain a
dinner waistcoat. The central point is:
Who between October 26 and November 13
skimmed the cream oil’ the share market
from 14s. 6d. to 4s. 6d.? That question
answered, the missing link in the chain
would be in its place. The committee of
the Stock Exchange of Melbourne, if it likes
to become a real protector of the investor,
can supply it. Let the committee examine
the books of members to see who were the
sellers.
* * * *
A swell Melbourne crowd has frozen on
to the California Creek tin-dredging area
near the Gilmore railway station (Q.).
Factors for the investor are that the co.
holds a mile in length of the creek bed, that
a granite bar forms a natural catchment,
that at the bottom of the creek is a decom-
posed granite bottom into which for count-
less ages the gravel and tin have been swept
from higher up. Plum-pudding dirt of the
kind should be sweet enough without added
riches, but it is told that the wash also
has enrichments from the “famous Gilmore
and other lodes.” It looks good, but it will
take the dredge to settle the matter. De-
posits range to 40ft. in depth, and 40 shafts
have gone down along the course of the
stream to test things. None of them got to
bedrock, but the tally given is of 11b. at
the surface to 41b. at the depth reached. The
average of the samplings is said to be 141 b.,
and J. A. Hadley, an old Victorian alluvial
hand, gives the show such a chance that
the co. is already framed. It is modestly
built of 30,000 £1 shares, 15,000 of them
to be 10 p.c. cum.-participating, 9000 paids
to go to vendors along with £5OOO, and 6000
shares to be held in reserve. A dredge to
treat 40,000 c. yds. a month is available,
and it is to have 3,000,000 c. yds. to flirt
with before the claim will be worked out.
On an output of 30,000yds. a month, and
with costs at 6d. a c. yd., a profit of £2920
is estimated.
* * * *
Under Voss Smith Block 14 did well last
six months, and distributed £5OOO in divs.
among its 100,000 ords. The working agree-
ment with the Prop, goes on, and better
results follow now that the handling of a
13 p.c. lead ore at a profit is not a worry.
The co. breaks about 24,000 tons of ore each
six months, and with metals high its harvest
last term was £102,000. Costs ate up £74,550,
and as about £7OOO was gobbled up for taxa-
tion and head-office exes., the profit worked
out at £20,852, or well below 20s. each ton
of ore treated. As against £5200 of out-
side debts at September 30, the co. showed:
Commonwealth bonds, £37,589 ; concentrates
being sold, £24,252; cash, £7754; sundry
debtors, £1263; and stores and fuel, £6070.
Not a bad showing for a derelict.
Great Boulder has had its annual roll-up
in London. The official report states that,
in view of additional burdens in the shape
of workers’ insurance, etc., the board recently
sounded those of neighboring mines with
reference to the future handling of their pro-
perties. A. 11. Collier (director) said the
board didn’t intend to treat the remaining
80,000 tons in the mine for the sole benefit
of the workmen, nor did it propose to gut
the show. The board favored a working
agreement with other cos., and he thought
such an agreement would be come to for
treating the ore remaining in the mine.
Holders of Wilkinson’s Amalgamated,
Yalwal (N.S.W.) are heartened by the news
that a trial parcel of 15 tons gave above
half an ounce, and that, with the additional
10 head of stamps in course of erection, 60
tons or more should be handled per day. If
the ore is there, 1200 tons a month shouldn’t
strain a 15-head mill. Fed with free milling
ore, a 10-head plant in W.A. topped 2500 tons
a month. The Edna May at Westonia put
through 3000 tons or thereabout for years.
* * * *
Satisfactory mine developments at Mt. Isa
(Q.) continue. Probably the most satisfac-
tory development, however, is that which
has taken place on the financial side. Anglo-
American Corp. of South Africa, Ltd., has
taken up 50,000 £1 shares at par, and in
return has acquired an option, subject to
inspection of the mine, of taking a further
£550,000 shares at par. A decision on the
option is to be given within five months. The
Anglo-American Corp. has a paid capital
of £3,718,453, and holds large interests in
copper, diamonds, silver-lead, coal and plati-
num. Apart from its strong financial back-
ing, it commands what is of vital importance
to Mt. Isa, a technical organisation. Aus-
tralia is fortunate in having something big
enough to attract this co.’s attention.
Although Mt. Isa is yet in its infancy
the official figures indicate that there is
already available sufficient ore to keep a
plant going at the rate of 1000 tons a day
for 14 years. A reasonable expectation is
that another 200 ft. of depth development
will add a further 14 years’ life —perhaps
more. We have not had any deposit quite
like this before in Australian mining history.
* * * *
Natural gas was struck in apparently con-
siderable quantity at Mt. Forbes, Ipswich
district (Q.), near an area bored some years
ago by an Ipswich co. for oil. This circum-
stance gave rise to a local recrudescence of
oil fever. L. C. Ball has mapped the area,
and finds that it contains coals and volcanic
rocks mixed up. The resultants would pro-
bably be gas and a little distilled oil. thus
reasonably accounting for the supposed
petroliferous manifestations there.
* * * *
Official reports show that the local esti-
mates of the coal proved in the new field at
Howard (Q.) must be written down from
three million to half a million. The coal
is of good quality, averages 3ft. thick, and
is fairly handy to rail. It is probable there
are some millions of tons outside the limit
of boring. So far there is no official
announcement regarding the opening of a
State colliery there, and prospects of such
are discounted by the Queensland Premier’s
recent utterances.
* * * *
Last week the Federal Government issued
a statement on the position at the Bulolo
River goldfields in New Guinea. The state-
ment is both unconvincing and unsatis-
factory. The cause of the trouble was the
granting of large sluicing and dredging
areas on virgin ground which is, admittedly,
easily capable of being worked in the ordi-
nary pick-and-shovel way. The pronunci-
amento says that the granting of the extensive
dredging and sluicing areas was pursuant
to the provisions of the New Guinea Mining
Ordinance. Then it is a rotten ordinance.
But even if the power to grant leases exists
it should never have been exercised in such
a case. The general law and custom is that
the individual digger shall receive preference
on new fields. The granting of areas for
machine working on such a field is absolutely
unheard of. In the Bulolo case, moreover, no
attempt seems to have been made to comply
with leasehold conditions. The ill-informed
and ill-advised Government ignores this im-
portant feature of the situation. This makes
the veiled threat that “the Government wishes
it to be clearly understood by all concerned
that violation of the law, or recourse to
unconstitutional measures, cannot be count-
enanced or tolerated” the less understandable.
Dr. Page admits that the Central Court
had quashed the grant of the leases. Where,
tl.en, is there any violation of the law or
recourse to unconstitutional measures, in
the pegging out of claims by miners? The
statement by the Acting-Prime Minister is
based on a report by New Guinea authorities
who are on their trial as regards this ques-
tion of goldfield administration, and that
report should never have been published.
* # * *
The first half-yearly report of Guinea Gold
was issued last week. The co. is an Adel-
aide flotation to work leases near Edie Creek,
New Guinea. Shareholders have exercised
the option of taking up five new shares for
every one originally held, making authorised
capital £50,000 and issued capital £26,266,
this last including £6566 vendors’ shares.
The two leases sold to the co. by C. J.
Levien, now general manager, have been
consolidated. The report says that the lease-
holds, which are some miles from Edie Creek
proper, have not been affected by the recent
commotion. Quite as important is the state-
ment that the co. has bought a sluicing
plant; it, at least, looks as if one co. is
attempting to carry out the lease conditions.
Whether leases of this type can be legally
granted on the new goldfield is, however, a
matter of doubt, and till the position is
thoroughly clarified shareholders should not
be too optimistic.


THE LITTLE INNOCENTS.

that space was at a premium in the convey-

“M.R.C.”: Paragraphs about the pickled-

“Ivapai” : In these Doctor v. Digger epi-

I knew a young
Maorilander who
on his first exami-

tale of having suf-
fered for years
from a mild form
ef appendicitis,
whereupon the doc-
tor tartly retorted
that he knew
chronic appendicitis
when he met it.
After sundry ups
and downs in camp
the unfit young
man was shipped
overseas. He
cracked up at Sling
Camp. and was
sent in one morn-

in whom he recog-

enemy. After a
careful examina-
tion the doctor
roared “What dam’

“You, sir,” said the young man mildly. The
patient got an early move.
“Hamer”: As an offset to the controversy
about the number of passengers who have
crowded into a single taxi, it might be in-
teresting to consider people who have re-
quired more than one cab to carry them. It
was a habit of a remittance man who was
a notable character in the old days of Sydney
to keep two cabs in attendance on the hectic
days and nights that followed the receipt of
his quarterly remittance. He was a haughty
chap, even when lie was reduced to cadging
bobs; when lie was in funds he disdained to
ride in the same cab with his hat. coat and
stick, so these articles had to follow in a
second hansom. Also there was a N.B.W.
politician of other days who struck the idea,
during a drinking bout, of a trial funeral.
He hired a dozen cabs, and with himself
in the first one trundled out to Waverley

“Sam W. U.”: Speaking of duplicated
marriage services (B. 18/11/’26), I once
knew a happy couple who went through the
ceremony on four successive days. It was
in Paraguay, South America, in 1915. The
bridegroom came down the river from Brazil
where he had resided for years, and the bride
was a resident of Asuncion. Both were
English. The ’groom was given a clearance
by the British Legation in Brazil, and
declarations signed before the civil autliori-
rities there; he then came to Paraguay, and
on Wednesday the happy couple satisfied the
Paraguayan civil laws by being married be-
fore a justice. On Thursday they were mar-
ried by the Brazilian Consul, on Friday by
the British Consul, and on Saturday a
Church of England minister finished the job
in our little church. It was ma-in-law who
insisted on the final bit of knot-tying.
“Sayo Nara” : In the early days of Fre-
mantle the public morgue was a dingy
weatherboard building, perched on the cliffs
near Arthur’s Head. Late one afternoon
the bodies of two men who had met their
death in suspicious circumstances were
placed therein, the official post-mortem being-
fixed for the morrow. Next morning when
the Coroner arrived with his assistant no-
thing was to be found but the brick founda-
tion of the building. What was left of the
other part was floating around in four
fathoms of w r ater at the bottom of the cliff.
The sharks had attended to the post-mortem.

“Q. 8.” : An li.C. prelate threatens to pro-
vide Brisbane with a sensational case. One
of the lost lambs of his flock, a. ho for many
years had provided illicit pleasures, was
taken ill a few weeks ago, and in great
alarm staged the death-bed repentance act
with elaboration. She had amassed a great
deal of money, and bethinking her of the
quite unsectarian support she had received,
she “remembered” a few of the churches.
Even the Army got £5OO. But the great
bulk of her property she willed to the cleric;
the only condition made being that she was
to be readmitted to the fold and buried in
the odor of sanctity. When the whole pro-
position was put before the prelate, he also
made a condition. One of the Brisbane
Sunday papers got hold of the story and
printed it, whereupon the Sabbath Day be-
came vocal and even buzzing. The tale of
the “tainted money” lost nothing in the tell-
ing, so in sheer self-defence the R.C. “head”
published his explanation in the next day’s
papers. He was particularly sore about the
term “tainted money” ; but the bulk of his
explanation lay in the statement that “this
woman sought to be reconciled to Holy
Church, but I would not give her the sacra-
ments or Christian burial until she promised
to close all her houses. She did so, and now
they are closed for ever!” Then the angry
shepherd vowed that he “would give the
editor a chance to prove his words in a court
of law,” and all Queensland is anxiously
hoping that he will.
“Herodot”: Some of the bank accounts
which appear to have been forgotten by their
owners are the proceeds of robberies, and
they will be claimed by and bye. On one
occasion the Melbourne police succeeded in
tracing £3OO, the bulk of the plunder from
a hold-up job, to the bank in which it had
been placed for safe-keeping. The man who
bad put it there was already in gaol for his
share in the affair, but the police had no defi-
nite proof that lie was the depositor. For
him to have touched it would have been
equivalent to an admission that it had been
derived from the crime, and for months after
his release the crook made no attempt to
draw, on his account, although he was in
extreme poverty. Then one day a solicitor
appeared with an order for the whole amount,
and when questioned refused to break the
confidence placed in him by his client. The
bank had to pay him.

“Macess”: Closer than a trade-mark do
those spats stick to our Mr. Bruce. A Mel-
bourne Sun cable tells us that, “despite the
criticism of the Tailor and Cutter that
spats are out of date, Mr. Bruce continues
to wear them,” also that, “with the exception
of the Attorney-General [Mr. Latham], the
whole of the Australian delegation at the
Imperial Peace Conference wears spats.”
It may be that the legal mind
In such extremities doth find
A likelihood of action latent —
To wit, infringement of a patent!

“Wingella”: An American scientist sug-
gests that persons who refrain from using
salt and sugar are less likely to be attacked
by mosquitoes or sandflies than persons who
take those foods. Is there anything in it?
I never use sugar, nor do I like much salt,
and mosquitoes seldom trouble me, nor do
I ever suffer from fever. Yet the man of
the house, who uses both those condiments
to excess, as I think, is literally a feeding-
ground for the insects. If the theory is
tenable —and ground is given to that by the
fact that niggers, who in their wild state

ise that I’m lucky to be wearing it even

never use either salt or sugar, will live in
comfort among swarms of mosquitoes that
would send a w T hite man into delirium —then
it should be an easy matter to choose the
right types of men for the advance guard
into fever-stricken districts. It looks, at
least, as if it would bear investigation.
“Sucre”: I hadn’t seen dear old Aunt
Eliza since last Christmas, but I knew she
had married again. My eyes stepped out on
to my cheek-bones when I saw her rigged out
like a country-town hearse in black and
nodding plumes. “Heavens, Eliza!” I
exclaimed, “has No. 2 gone too?” “Oh,
dear, no, ’Arold,” she sobbed, “but ’e ’as
been so nasty to me that I put on me weeds
again for poor William.” Poor William was
No. 1.
ANCIENT BREW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Dr. Law led a deputation from the Prohibition
League. He mentioned the forbidden fruit in the
Garden of Eden. ‘Tradition says it was an apple,’ he
said. ‘The Prohibitionist League suggests that Eve
went further and used her knowledge of domestic
arts to devise intoxicating drinks —such as eider—
from the original forbidden fruit. Thus came the
curse of drink.’ ”
Then are there no pages
Adown the dim ages
Quite “spot”-less, I pray?
Is it true, as you say,
That man at his making
So soon, for his slaking,
Sought something more spry
Than fell from the sky ?
Are we but renewing
Primeval home-brewing
AVhen now we ferment ?
Did Eve, then, invent
The glow beatific,
And headache horrific
To-day we attain—
The bliss and the pain?
The puce and green lizards
That latter-day wizards
From bottles extract
Seem matter of fact ,
Beside what one visions
Of dread apparitions
To him on whom seize
Troglodytic d.t.’s.
When thoroughly “appled,”
A dinosaur dappled
Our ancestor blue
Would probably view.
And this it makes plainer:
If no great abstainer
Was Adam in Eden, the world is the gainer,
Since, granting the claims Prohibitionists
make,
We know how to take
That tale of a snake!

“P.X.”: It isn’t so easy to give valuables
away as you might think. I know a man
who, having bought a cow for £l2 and
lodged her in his tiny inner suburban pad-
dock, found her a nuisance and tried to sell
her. Discovering no buyers, he next tried
to give her away, and couldn’t—vainly sought
even to be allowed to make of her a present
to the Salvation Army. The beast couldn’t
be driven through the streets (that was
against the law), and nobody would chance
leading her. Finally he had to offer a bonus
with her. But it isn’t only in the suburbs
that that may happen. A Melbourne syndi-
cate a while ago became interested in some
alleged banana plantations on the N.S.W.-
Queensland border. When it got to the end
of its tether it found itself with a couple of
precipitous bunchy-top “farms” which no-
body wanted, even as a gift. However,
there were half a dozen cattle on one of them
which at any rate looked “worth a few quid,”
and the visiting directors proceeded to suggest
a sale. At once they struck trouble. There
were townships and saleyards on the N.S.W.
side, but the brutes couldn’t be got there on
account of the tick regulations, and it would
cost more than they were worth to drive them
to a Queensland market. “Well, turn ’em
loose !” the directors at last said in despair.
“Afraid you can’t,” said the local potentate.
“They’d be liable to do damage, and you’d
be responsible.” At latest they were still
being offered with a pound of tea, or words
to that effect.
“Crojack” : The question of the final dis-
posal of the hulk Inca, which played the
part of the convict ship Hydaspes in the
screening of “For the Term of His Natural
Life,” is beginning to worry the present
owners as much as it did the last one.
Captain Auland bought the Inca after she
was dismasted 400 miles from Sydney Heads
in 1921. He intended to re-rig her, but the
fall in ship values put it out of the question.
BRINGING THE SPIRITS TO EARTH.
MR SHRIMP : “Con y’ read th’ past as well as th’ future, Missus?”
MADAME GOOCHI: “Sir, the past is to me as an open book.”
MR. SHEIMP: “Good! Well, you're on a dollar if y’ can tell me
what it was the missus told me t' bring 'one for tea—pork
sausages or pigs’ trotters?”
Since then the hulk has lain at moorings,
and had to be docked every year to prevent
her sinking. At one time Ben Fuller talked
of making her into a floating theatre at
Elizabeth Bay, and another idea was to use
her as a cool-store for apples awaiting ship-
ment. Finally she was sold for a song to
Australasian Films, Ltd. Now she has
played her part, the old American schooner
will have to be loaded with something heavy,
towed well out and sunk, or else burned to
the water’s edge, and her keelson and other
heavy timbers retrieved from the bottom of
the harbor and taken ashore. The Inca
was built in California of exceptionally long
timbers, and her keelson is unusually heavy.
If the ship had been blown up off-shore, this

lump of lumber would have floated and
become a menace to shipping. Something
will have to be done with the hulk soon,
for it is full of “snake holes,” and if the
old craft sank at her moorings at Berry’s
Bay tliere’d be a fine bill to pay.

“Q.Q.”: One day during the war I was
administering an anaesthetic for an operation
on a wounded soldier from a colleague’s ward.
As he was going under he began to talk, and
I whispered to the sister, “This lad is an
Australian—l know by his lingo.” Said the
Digger, who had overheard my remark, “Yes,
and a —— good Australian.” “All right,
old son,” said I, “I am one, too, so you are
in the right hands.” “Where do you come
from?” he asked. “Melbourne,” I told him.
By this time he was nearly off, but was
going to get in the last word. Between snores
he just managed to squeeze out: “Mel-
bourne!” (disgustedly) “Huh!” (snores) “I
wouldn’t be. .. .found dead” (more snores)
.. . .“in. . . .Melbou. ...”

“ Manawatu ”: The ordinary Chinese
garden John may not indulge in whistling,
but there is one in Ilunterville (M.L.) who
is a notable exception. Some time ago an
instructor of bag-
pipes came to
anchor in the vil-
lage, and among
those who took les-
sons was Ah John.
As I walked down
the main street one
day the strains of
some Scotch air
smote my ears, and
I asked who the
perpetrator wa s.
“Oh, that’s the
Chow —he’s not too
bad either,” I was
told. A little later
I observed John at
his doorway whist-
ling the various
airs he was in the
habit of playing.
The local bands-
men went crook
about the idea of a
yellow piper, but
the instructor in-
sisted on teaching
“any blanky cow
who paid up.” By
the same token, the
same band (minus
John) played
something one day which two Scotchmen
recognised as two different things. The local
paper named it a third thing, and then the
dispute was never settled.

“Solomon M.”: The Arab gentleman who
shot air-mechanic Elliott in Mesopotamia
has been located, and handed five years. It
isn’t much, but it is probably more than he
would have got in Melbourne. Nobody
knows why he did it. Possibly someone
told him that the British Empire had fallen,
and he hurried in Arabian style to join the
winning side. The Australians got to know
their desert brother well while campaigning
along the Jordan. When the British made
their first move beyond the Canal it was
foolishly done with a rather raw force of
yeomanry. The Turks fell on it at Romani,
and some were killed, some taken prisoners
(Abdul afterwards made a parade of them
through Jaffa and Jerusalem), some were
left wounded, and some started on the run
back to Egypt. Abdul, being in weak force,
withdrew after liis little success. Then the
local Arabs, recognising that the British
Empire had fallen never to rise again, de-
cided on their line of conduct. They stripped
the wounded, refused them water, made con-
temptuous remarks, and left them to the
jackals. Luckily a fast-moving Australian
force of men who knew something about
deserts forestalled the jackals. The Arabs
had a slight preference for the Allies because
they paid much better than the impecunious
Turk, and at several battles they were seen
raising a friendly dust in the distance ; also
they had a value as raiders. But they could
never be trusted with military information
of a saleable sort. The fact that Allied offi-
cers turned some 4000 of the scuttling sons
of the wilderness into passable troops was
one more proof that the white man is the
real doer of things.

“ Jcobb”: She must be a bright young
thing; I am wondering if the cities have
many of the type. Writing to me in reply
to a small exchange ad. in one of the city
papers, she stated that she desired a corres-
pondent in North Australia, enclosing the
photo of a rather attractive damsel. She
had read a lot about the natives of the North,
and how few white women there were—-not
enough to go the rounds of the eligibles. Her
age was 25, and she had ideas of marriage;
if I was married or otherwise unfit for that
happy state, could I put her in touch with
some clean-living desirable young man —
occupation not important? Showing that she
was uncontaminated by the roses and rap-
tures of city life, she could and would for-
ward a clean bill of health on receipt of one
from myself or friend. Having no desire
to start a matrimonial agency, I declined the
offer, but gently suggested that she should
come North, seek a position suited to her
talents, and so get in touch with likely
suitors.

“Quack”: During a sick-parade in a gar-
rison town in England in 1016, a soldier laid
before me some colored fragments of glass.
“Broke my glass-eye, sir.” I sent in a
requisition to the hospital for a new one.
Hospital authorities sent back an inquiry,
“Was the breakage done while on duty?”
I forwarded this to the adjutant with a
minute attached. Next day, in battalion
orders, appeared: “A Court of Inquiry will
be held to-morrow, consisting of Major
Smith, president; Captains Jones and
Thomas, members, to decide on the following
—whether the glass-eye in the possession of
No. 1,234,567, Pte. Atkins. TIL, was broken
■while in the execution of his duty.” The
Court duly sat and held a long and pon-
derous inquiry. Many witnesses were
examined, and in due time the Court’s report
was written on the man’s medical-history
sheet. The sheet was then sent to the hos-
pital. The R.A.M.C. colonel noted: (a)
That the Court had not stated whether the
eye originally in the possession of No.
1,234,567, Pte. Atkins, T.H., belonged to
the said soldier or to his Majesty the King ;
(b) that the medical-history sheet is not
the correct document in which to record the
Court’s findings. In due time battalion
orders contained the notice that “a Court,
consisting of,” etc., etc., would “sit to-
morrow to determine whether the glass-eye of
No. 1,234,567, Pte. Atkins, T.H., was the
property of the said soldier or of his Majesty
the King.” Finally, it was decided that his
Britannic Majesty was the owner of the
said glass-eye, and the report was made on
the proper army form PQZ 1007 A (i) and
sent to the orderly-room. Orderly-room sent
it to hospital. Hospital authorities replied
that they did not store glass-eyes, and advised
Orderly-room to indent on Ordnance. Then
the whole affair passed out of my ken. And
then I forgot it. Nine months later a man
with a vaguely-familiar face wandered into
my sick-parade, and began to tell me about
liia troubles. “It’s about my glass-eye, sir.”
I remembered. “Good heavens, man, have
you broken it again?” I said. “No, sir; it’s
about the old one. I was just wondering
when I’m going to get a new one, sir.” Won-
derful are the ways of the Army!

“58” : Young Australia is little disposed to
take things for granted. For a quarter of a
century “Young Lochinvar” was in one of
the Royal Readers in general use in the State
schools of Victoria. For another quarter-
century it appeared periodically in the school
paper. Dealing as it did with the abduction
of a married woman, it was sometimes classed
as unsuitable matter for the young. But it
was reserved for a bush boy to throw scorn
upon it. The lines which upset him were:
So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,
So light to the saddle before her he sprung.
“Rats!” he exclaimed. “How could he get
his leg over the horse?”
“Wang”: No, you never know what the
poor man may be suffering from. In a Mel-
bourne suburban police court the other day,
when a man was charged with assaulting his
wife, he pleaded great provocation. “It’s
all through her chasin’ after funerals, y’
Worship,” he said. “She gets th’ paper in
tli’ mornin’ an’ reads th’ funeral advts., an’
then she clears off. Then when she comes
home she hangs over the fence talkin’ to th’
neighbors, tellin’ them about it. I put up
with it, yer Worships, till she began to deco-
rate th’ house with snapshots of funerals.
Then I took her camera an’ hit her over th’
head with it.” The Bench almost apologised
for having to fine him anything.
“Mabyn”: How’s this for the irony of
Fate? In our fairly new subbub there’s a
short cut leading to the station which is

weather. Binks, who owns the largest house
in the district, organised the business men,
and on Saturday afternoon they carried
stones and laid a nice, smooth road that
any town might be proud of. Then
Binks made a speech about the value of self-
help and not crying to the Council or the
Government for aid at every turn, and Mrs.
Binks invited the workers home to after-
noon tea. It rained on Sunday, and on
Monday morning Binks slid full length on the
new road and broke an arm and three ribs.

Unitarianism became almost a literary
fashion in Sydney during George Walters’s
first term as minister at the Liverpool-street
church. Son of an artist, and the associate
in his youth of artists and writers, Walters
made the church an intellectual centre. Then
lie wrote “Joseph of Canaan,” and after it
had been staged in Sydney and Melbourne
went to England to get it produced there.
His successors included A. B. Worthington,
most impressive of Yankee humbugs, whose
P. F. LOUGHLIN, the lender of the rebel-
lion in the N.S.W. Parliamentary Labor
party.
exposure was a sad blow to the sect in
Australia.* Walters became minister in Syd-
ney again years afterwards, but was unable
to rally round him the coterie that made his
first ministry so notable. A motor-car killed
him a few days ago, at 73.
Labor Minister “Billy” Angwin will suc-
ceed H. P. Colebatch as W.A. Agent-General
next March. This is only the second time a
Labor Administration has had to fill .the
job; the first occasion was in 1904, when,
having no one in its own ranks who wanted
the billet or was deemed capable of filling
it, it got rid of the then Opposition leader
( Walter James, K.C.) by pressing it upon
him. Angwin is a stocky little Cornishman,
essentially one of the moderates of the party,
who has sat for a Fremantle constituency
since. 1904. Also lie has liad a place in
every Labor Administration that has bloomed
and faded in Groperland since he entered
Parliament, though he was only an honorary
m the first team. He was one of those who
spoke for conscription in the early days of
tne war, but he didn't leave the party over
it, submitting, instead, to be disciplined. He
was a wire-mattress maker before he took
to politics.
General Chauvel looks as if lie might be
the first of the line of native-born State
Governors. The Inspector-General of Austra-
lian military forces was born at Tabulam,
on the N.S.W. North Coast, 61 years ago.
and has been soldiering since ISS6, when he
became a second lieutenant in the N.S.W.
Cavalry. Queensland may ask for him.
Peter Loughlin roamed Canberra bare-
footed at a time when Canberra w r as as far
from being an Australian capital as the
gawky boy was from being the storm-centre
of a political crisis. He started his career
as a schoolteacher, qualifying whilst work-
ing in a country store. He became interested
in politics, and entered Parliament in 1917
as selected Laborite for Burragong. Sydney
was a vague sort of place to him until he
entered Parliament, and he is never likely
to suffer from the delusion that it is the
whole State.
Alastair Edward Stephen, just admitted
to practise law in N. S. Wales, is the fifth
of his line in the State. Great-great-grand-
fatlier was John Stephen, a Judge of the
Supreme Court, who once acted as Chief
•Justice. Great-grandfather was Alfred,
Chief Justice for 29 years; grandfather was
Septimus Stephen, of the law firm of
Stephen, Jaques and Stephen; and the father
of the new solicitor belonged to the same
firm. The Windeyer family is the only
other one in the State with a record of five
generations in law. The Allens run to four.
Major-General “Vic” Selllieim, the new
Administrator of Norfolk Island, was born in
Sydney but spent most of his youth on
Charters Towers, where his dad, afterwards
Queensland Under-Secretary for Mines, was
gold warden for years. Beginning soldiering
on the Queensland Instructional Staff “Vic”
served as a staff officer in the last Boer un-
pleasantness and in the Big Scrap lie was
A.A. and Q.M.G., and later G.0.C., A.1.F., in
Egypt and Britain. Till lately lie was
Adjutant-General and second member of the
Military Board A big man, up and down
and round about, he will need all the elbow
room Norfolk Island can give him. His
maternal grandfather, Colonel Morisett, was
an early military Commandant of the island.
Old Temple Court, King-street, Sydney, 43
years ago was frequented by three youths
destined to rise to giddy heights. Jack Lang
was a raw-boned, gawky youth, who showed
a good deal of wrist and ankle, and who
bounded upstairs two or three steps at a
time to the office of his boss, Harley, the
estate-agent, for whom he collected rents.
George Beeby, somewhat older, toiled in a
law office near by; and Dick Meagher, about
Lang’s age, was articled to a solicitor in the
same court. It took a special Act of Parlia-
ment to re-make Meagher a solicitor after an
early accident, but before that happened he
had been Speaker of N.S.W. Assembly and
Eord Mayor of Sydney. Beeby is a Judge,
and Lang, as Premier of N.S.W., has just
produced the world’s worst Budget.
“Ghosty” Downs, who escaped from
Hobart Gaol with three others recently, was
regarded in Launceston as a sort of Robin
Hood. One of his exploits was the shoot-
ing of the trained stag of the Tamar Hunt
Club, which, with its feet dipped in a solu-
tion that gave the dogs no difficulty in trail-
ing it, used to lead the hunt a merry dance,
returning safely on each occasion. “Ghosty”
escaped by stunning his police escort with
the manacles on his wrist, and found a
hiding-place under the house of a contractor
who used to be his employer. Downs’s popu-
larity in Launceston waned when it became
knpwm that he had secured his release from
prison on one occasion by serving as hang-
man. A couple of years ago he was found
guilty of killing his second wife, and got 14
years for manslaughter. There is still some
mystery surrounding the disappearance of
his first wife. Downs said she eloped with
another man, but she hasn’t been seen for
a long while.
N.S.W. Judge Bevan, who, 70 this year,
is ripe for retirement, reached the Bench
by a very indirect route. He intended to
settle in California as an orchardist, but a
brother, a surveyor in Queensland, invited
him to spend a year with him. Bevan at
the end of the year decided to stay on. He
was a clerk in the Garden Palace Exhibi-
tion, and a jackeroo in the Riverina; then
his friend George (afterwards Justice) Innes
got him into the Department of Justice. He
studied law rather late in life, and wasn’t
“admitted” till he was in the thirties. First
as Crown Prosecutor and later as Judge on
the Far West circuit he has done a prodi-
gious amount of travelling up and down N. S.
Wales.
The appointment of J. D. McLean, O.P.S.
at Dalby (Q.), as mining warden for the
Edie Creek goldfield. New Guinea, was a
very sudden affair. Trouble on the goldfield
led to the appointment of the Rabaul Super-
intendent of Police, Grose, as acting-warden,

with the newspapers.
Lean, who lias had N.Q. mining experience,
was given an hour to decide whether he
would take the job, and was told that if
he did take it he must leave Brisbane in
three days. Owing to the breakdown of a
motor-car he missed the mail train at Dalby,
and it looked as if he would have no chance
of catching his boat, but after a chase by
motor-car he caught the train at Toowoomba.
Arising out of the death of Judge Mitchell
in S. Aus., W. R. Kelly becomes stipendiary
magistrate at 27. He must be pretty nearly
the youngest beak in the world, yet it isn’t
his first magistracy. He was Mayor of
Yorketown at 24.
George Loveday, recently dead, was one
of the crack rifleshots of M.L., and at
Bisley in 1902 was top scorer of the Domi-
nion team. He trained his four sons and
two daughters to look along a rifle-barrel,
and saw his son Leslie win the King’s Prize
in 1919 and twice annex the M.L. cham-
pionship. All the others were champion
shots, the two girls doing their share towards
gathering the 60 medals the family holds.
Augustus John Ligar Coates, who died
in Auckland lately, aged 77, was a son of
the marriage between the private secretary
and the governess brought to M.L. by Cap-
tain Hobson, the man who proclaimed the
British sovereignty and was the “depend-
ency’s” first Governor.
One of the oldest employees of Broken
Hill Prop., John Bristowe, has just passed
away, aged 65. He was born at Mount
Gambier (S.A.) in 1861, and joined the
B. H. P. Co. in 1887 as accountant. He was
a genial, kindly soul, and did what he could
on the hospital and other committees.
David Mallows, one of Fremantle’s well-
known beggars, who used to hunt scraps in
the gutter, was so afraid of being reduced
to beggary that lie socked away every half-
penny he could lay hands on. He died with
a credit of £4OO in a Savings Bank account,
£7OO on deposit in the West Australian
Bank, and securities including War Bonds
and shares in the Commercial Bank of large
value. A lodging-house keeper put in an
account for 161 weeks' board, £194, but the
Curator of Intestate Estates, after viewing
the way Mallows had lived, reckoned that
£5B ought to settle the bill. Mallows did
most of his cadging from workmen, far
poorer than he was himself.
Robert Stewart Reid, who jumped over
the cliffs at Manly (N.S.W.) the other day,
may be set down as a war victim. He won
the D.S.O. and held a commission as lieut.-
colonel in the Big Scrap, but had never
relished life since. Only a few weeks before
his death he was missed from a Watson’s
Bay ferry steamer when it arrived at the
Quay, and was found by the water police
clinging to a buoy near Garden Island. In
civil life he was a mining engineer.
Carre Riddell, who succeeded Fitzgibbon
as chairman of Melbourne Metropolitan
Board of Works, and has just returned from
a tour in Europe, will clash with Cameron,
chairman of the Tramway Board, if he keeps
on broadcasting his view that electric trams
are a public nuisance that should be super-
seded by motor-’buses. Two years ago Riddell
would have got more listeners in Melbourne.
Electric cars along Swanston-street have
reconciled many people to them as handy
means of locomotion, whereas the cumber-
some ’buses certainly haven’t been making
more friends.
Controversy that has arisen over the names
of the proposed new Vic. electorates fashioned
by the Commission—as to whether Colfban
should be substituted for Castlemaine, and
so forth —has recalled an incident in the
Assembly 23 years ago in which Tom Hunt,
still going strong at Kilmore, and Graves,
now under the sod, figured. Hunt said he’d
like to change the name of Anglesey, but
hesitated to speak before Graves, member
tor Moira. “Go ahead,” persuaded Graves.
“Then,” said Hunt, “I’d suggest it be called
Gravesend.” It was christened instead Upper
Goulburn, but it was Graves’ end all right.
He stood for the electorate, was beaten,
and disappeared from the House after 27
years in it.
A Japanese of the bluest blood is Isamitsu
Kitakoji, who has been appointed a reader
in Oriental studies at Sydney Uni. Son of
Viscount Kitakoji, he was educated at the
Peers’ College, and later at Tokio University,
and _is 37 years of age. His published
writings include plays and stories.
The death of Margaret Morison Ward-Cole
at Brighton (Vic.) recalls that her father,
Captain George Ward-Cole, was for 20 years
a member of Vic. Uppali Chambah, and
it was he who was largely if not mainly
instrumental in inducing the great Higin-
botham to stand for the Assembly in ’59.
Ward-Cole never went very' far himself,
though he was one of McCulloch’s Ministers
in the stormy days.
After carrying the barb of a black's spear
in his lung for 22 years, Sam Hazlett, now
lying in Mudgee (N.S.W.) Hospital, has
had it dug out. Hazlett was in Central Aus-
tralia when he was attacked by blacks whilst
bending down to get some water; his revol-
ver quickly scattered the abos., but they left
two spears in him. Hazlett’s mates helped
to extract the spear-points and nurse their
comrade to health ; but a barb which pene-
trated the lung was allowed to remain.
“A. Borig”: The old Victoria Hotel in
Queanbeyan has been run by three genera-
tions of the Land family. I can remember
the original Land 60 years ago ; then came
Ted Land, then his widow, and now her
son, Harry Land. For a time Hungerford,
who married Ted Land’s widow, kept it;
but it was always Land’s Hotel.
BOOK AGENT : “Have you a Charles Dickens
in the house, Ma’am?”
MA’AM: “No.”
BOOK AGENT : “Or a Robert Louis Steven-
son?”
MA’AM: “You’d better try across the street.
This ain’t the boardin’-’ouse.”
Last week there arrived in Sydney a man
who in earlier times would have been kept
in quarantine. W. C. Irvine has been for
29 years in charge of the leper station at
.tselgaum, Western India, and he is taking a
long-postponed holiday. His wife and
daughter, who accompany him, have lived
with him, and they don’t look any the worse
for the risks they have run.
AVE CESAR!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Caesar is my great inspirer. I have his bust
before me always.” —Mussolini to the British Press
representatives at Rome.
1 watch the long parade of heroes pass,
Dictators, Doges, Men of Destiny,
Historic supermen who scorned the mass,
To find a model for a man like me.
Where is my worthy predecessor, one
Who rides the whirlwind and directs the storm,
Frederick the Great, or Attila the Hun,
Cromwell, the Iron Duke, George Washington,
Or Hughes’s noble form !
I see the laurel wreath on Louis’ brow,
Stout Cortes voyaging for gold and scalps,
Old Cincinnatus toiling at the plough,
Scant-breathed Napoleon scrambling up the Alps.
Leaders of men, the world’s great autocrats,
I see tremendous fellows all in line,
Richelieu in scarlet robes, and Wolsey’s hats,
Chamberlain’s orchids, Stanley Bruce’s spats,
But Julius for mine!
He conquered Britain, lie divided Gaul,
Divided it, I’ve somewhere heard, in three:
Csesar, the noblest Dago of them all,
Who came and saw and conquered, just like me.
I keep his bust, bald-headed, cold and stern,
An inspiration for relentless toil,
From good old Jule I’m not too proud to learn,
But add to fasces, which have served their turn,
A dose of castor-oil.

“Longo”: I don’t know why “Te Baba-
rantiko” (B. 21/10/’26), in poisoning
timber with a solution of arsenic and soda,
should get “erratic” kills, and I can’t under-
stand his difficulty in inducing men to "boil”
and apply “so dangerous a mixture.” Surely
the mixing in a dry state of 41b. arsenic
(cost, Bd. per lb.) and 21b. caustic soda (4d.
per lb.) in a kerosene-tin, and then filling
the tin with water, stirring it meanwhile
with a stick, does not entail much risk or
exertion; yet that is all that is required to
prepare the mixture. I have had no experi-
ence with ti-tree, but I have proved that
ringing young eucalypti invariably results
in a growth of suckers, whereas the smallest
quantity of the solution poured into a frill
ring all around saplings near the ground-
level results in a very high percentage of
immediate kills, provided that the work is
done when the sap is circulating freely. In
applying the mixture I use a tin kettle with
a spout having an outlet the size of a 14-
gauge wire. There is no call to poison
mature timber, as it rarely suckers, even if
sap-rung.
“Carnivorous Cary” : Everyone who when
a kid kept guinea pigs will grin at the
impassioned protests of Theo Hill, M.L.A.,
against the “starvation” of the beasts in the
Sydney Botanic Gardens till hunger forced
them to devour their young. Heading a depu-
tation of the R.S.P.C.A., he almost drew
tears from the Premier’s eyes with his story.
In solid fact, buck “pigs” invariably insist
on eating the new litter, and for this reason
expert guinea-piggers always shut Papa up
by himself when Mamma is in the straw,
and he is nof let out till the new family
is well grown. Buck rabbits have the same
curious tendency in captivity ■ — sometimes
even in a wild state. The ingenuity of the
doe in concealing her litter from the old man
is a commonplace of natural history.
* * * *
“W.T.W.” : I’ve heard of many methods of
shifting rats, and have seen some of them
tried, but here’s a remedy that has been used
with success several times at country railway
stations. Trap a rat, kill it, then half-roast
it over a fire, and leave the carcase in a place
where the pests are sure to find it. I
haven’t struck a case yet where they haven’t
all cleared out within 24 hours.
“Larrapinta”: The man who let Patter-
son’s curse loose in Victoria had a rival in a
jmstoralist of Claire
(S.A.) who planted
some harmless-look-
ing bulbs in his
homestead garden,
with the result
that in a few years
the grazing land
for miles around
was smothered with
the pink flowers of
the poisonous Cape
tulip. Its deadly
properties are
shown by the num-
erous skeletons of
horses and cows on
nearly every farm
and station in the
district. One strug-
gling cocky, who
could ill afford it,
has lost ten cows
and eight horses in
the last four years,
all through tulip-
poisoning. Bee-
keepers, however,
find it an excellent
pollen plant. The
squatters and
cockies have been
forced to plough
up their grazing
land, topdress it
and sow clover,
which smothers out
nearly every other
weed and grass. At
present the clover
is ousting the tulip
wherever the sheep
have been kept off
for a while. If the
pest is successfully
combated, the graz-
ing capacity of the area will probably be
doubled.
“Clerk”: Can any of the more reliable
members of the Abo. circle explain this
mystery? I was one of a party on a
steamer trip down the Murray from Swan
Hill to Morgan, and one cool evening we
passed a gum-tree which was a pillar of
fierce flames and shooting sparks. The tree
was up to its waistline in the flood waters,
20 yards or so out from the bank, and was
in the midst of a cluster of half-submerged
neighbors which had not been fired.
There was nothing excessively warm about
the weather, the district was wild and
deserted, and no one could suggest just how
that particular tree had been ignited. The
purser explained that the kookaburras
smoked cigarettes in that part of South Aus.,
and very likely one of them had dropped a
lighted butt. Any other explanations?
“Gordelphus”: I viewed a case of brutally
rough surgery on a station near Meeka-
tharra (W.A.), where a ’Ghan camel-team
was carting the clip. One Sunday we heard
a bull-camel roaring and moaning, and,
going across from the shed to see what was
the matter, arrived just in time to see the.
’Glian performing an extraordinary opera-
A DOMESTIC TRAGEDY.
DAD: “Where is the child?”
MUM: “Gracious! I must have had my pocket picked!”
tion on one of his team, which had a mangy
and diseased hump. He had the victim tied
down securely, and was scraping the skin
off its hump with a sharp knife. When he
had finished, he killed and skinned a sheep
which his offsider had brought along, and
smoothed the bleeding skin on to the raw
hump of the camel. Then he stitched the sheep-
skin on with twine and an ordinary broad-
ended needle used for sewing up bales.
Afterwards he told me this grafting of skin
was quite a common practice amongst camel-
drivers, and he had often performed the
operation before, and always with complete
success.
* * * *
“Up Top”: Scrubbers calved in tropical
scrubs impenetrable to horsemen feed at
the forest edges, can sniff a human a mile
away and are gone with the wind. Their
hides only are valuable. The hunter must
know the scrubbers’ habits. He must under-
stand their peculiarities of eyesight, of curi-
osity, of feeding hours and,
above all, of smell. He must
be a horseman unafraid of
gullies, hills, forests and
swamps—a genuine busliman
and an unerring shot built of
grit and run on nerve juice.
Otherwise he won’t make salt,
but may make a corpse. The
scrubbers, when cornered or
even merely taken by surprise
at close quarters, have a habit
of blindly rushing the first
thing moving. If wounded,
they invariably do the same.
The experienced hand coolly
dumdums the beast at close
range. This may sound easy,
but a berserk bull takes stop-
ping. Miss your beast and
you yourself are missed. Run
and you are lost. If others of
the mob are handy, they will
immediately wheel and make
straight for the running thing.
Though a sharp-pointed bullet
may go straight through the
brain the impetus of the beast
will nevertheless carry it
many yards. Wound a beast,
then follow him, but hasten
slowly. If his blood-drops
upon the grass are frothy,
then you will be able to locate
the beef a few hours later.
Or if you find a blood patch,
you will know that lie’s been
resting at the point of exhaus-
tion. If he’s only got a
“blighty,” don’t waste time
following him up. I’ve seen
cattlemen gallop up to a steer and with one
twist at the butt of his tail spin him to the
ground. No man has ever done that to a
Fingerpoint scrubber.
“Alastor” : The producer of a Bananaland
film has secured a picture of a dingo in the
act of howling. He and the photographer
halted at Cunningham’s Gap for a day ; but
the dingoes failed to appear at their favorite
waterhole. A cow was then slaughtered and
its remains scattered over a log that, with
the help of a favoring moon, was silhouetted
against the skyline. At midnight two dingoes
appeared and tore at the remains of the
cow, alternating their repast with growls
that reverberated from the mountains. One
dingo then mounted the log and for some
minutes gave a solo howding exhibition, rliis,
in its unique setting, should make a fine
Australian picture.
“Bad Australian” : I am afraid that “Billy
See” (B. 4/11/’26) is treating a serious
subject with undue levity when he affirms
that certain alpacas brought to Victoria
about the ’eighties “crossed with the local
angoras, producing an extra-heavy type of
goat which was common about Ballarat in
the ’nineties.” Has “Billy” ever considered
the period of gestation of the goat in rela-
tion to that of the alpaca? I have seen the
alpaca on his native mountains running with
angoras and plain goats, but have never
seen or heard of a cross between the animals.
The “pae” doesn’t cross, even with his near
relations, the llama, the liuanaco and the
vicuna.

“J.D.C.” : Why does a merino lamb born
m the summer months differ so greatly from
his full-blooded brother dropped in the
autumn or winter? The summer lamb is
always plainer and more open-woolled,
SOMETHING TO GO ON WITH.
NEW POLICRMAN : “A man's been robbed down in Bond-
street, and I’ve got one of ’em!”

longer in build and cleaner about the head
and points. The winter lamb of exactly
the same blood shows more wrinkles, is more
densely covered, is of rougher appearance,
and usually more compact and not so large
at the same age. By the time they are
two-tooths the distinction has to a great
extent vanished; and when full-grown both
are practically of the same type. Apparently
nature assumes that life will be a bit easier
for the hot-weather infant, but it seems
remarkable that the lamb should have the
power of overtaking his winter brother’s
development in such a short time.
THE MOTOR MAIL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We have sung our praise of the coaching days
With fiery steeds afoam
Over sunlit ways, where the sun’s last rays
Die out in a hazy gloam;
But this is a lay of the West to-day,
A song of the tempered steel,
Of the whirring screw and the mailman new,
The Knight of the Steering Wheel.
He travels the scrub to the cushioned rub
Of wheels on a measured track,
To the ring of the hub when he leaves the scrub
For the dreaming plains of black;
Past rivers abend to a questing end,
Over lanes the coach-horse knew,
Past dam and tank, with rattle and clank,
He hustles the mail-bags through.
His head-lamps gleam on the shimmering stream
That has slaked the coach teams’ thirst,
And his hot brakes scream' as the parted stream
Sprays wide in a drenching burst;
And the gidyas sway in their searching ray,
And the hills resound the chime
Of the bellbirds’ lay in the West to-day
With the motor mail on time.
When the clouds hang low and the storm winds
blow
And the lightning’s tendrils flash,
The screams of the steel with the thunder’s peal
Mix weird in a vibrant clash.
Let the gidyas toss and the hills across
Loom dark with their coats astir,
Yet the mail speeds past, in the Storm God’s blast,
With a rattle, clank and whir.
AND DAD KNEW.
“What is it makes the world go round?”
“Please, sir, father says it’s mixin’ drinks.”
When the moon glows dim by the desert’s rim
And a fresh tang scents the air,
'ilie mail shoots down from the mountain’s crown
With a minute still to spare.
But it’s on and on, and ever on
The riband of rutted track —•
The mail must win to the Fartliest-in
With its basket, box and sack.
We’ve drunk in praise of the coaching days
With fiery steeds afoam,
Over countless bars, while the winking stars
Smiled down from their hazy dome ;
But here is a toast for the West and Coast—-
And drink it in amber ale:
To the mailman new and the whirring screw—
Success to the motor mail!

INVEST IN TRANSPORTATION
Transportation is a vital factor in the business life of any country, but its importance in developing a land so vast and so comparatively new as
Australia cannot be overestimated. The amazing development of the Motor Trade in Australians but the natural answer to an urgent
economic need.
The possibilities of Motor transportation in Australia have hardly been tapped. The scattered distribution of its population, a climate that
tempts people into the open air for their pleasures, and a high standard of living and wages that make car ownership a possibility for a large
percentage of the population—these factors make the present and the future very bright for the Motor Trade.
THERE IS MONEY IN MOTORS. With the right cars, the right management to control, and adequate finance to ensure economy in
buying, efficient organisation, and consequently the lowest possible price to the consumer, then there is no safer or more profitable investment
to be found to-day than that in Motors.
Consolidated Motors satisfies these conditions completely. Its control of the agencies listed on this page, and its good fortune in securing men of
such wide experience and proven business ability for management are factors which ensure outstanding success for the Company, and
destines it to be one of the largest and most powerful organisations of its kind in Australasia.
THE RIGHT CARS
The Cars to be sold by the Company are of world-wide renown —Cars that are well established on the Australian market—Cars that have proved their reliability
and performance under Australian conditions.
There is no pioneering to be done. The sales turnover in these Cars already exceeds half a million sterling, and with the Company’s resources and organisa-
tion behind them, sales must rapidly increase.
Remember that point! The Company is taking over an established business, an existing connection and the goodwill that their High-grade Cars have won.
THE F.I.A.T. CARS AND TRUCKS. —The popularity of the F.I.A.T. in Australia is evidenced by the fact that during the year ending October 26, 1926, no
less than 841 cars and trucks were sold by Garratts, Ltd.
Wherever cars are discussed, the F.I.A.T. receives a measure of praise accorded to few cars. The wide range of its models; suit every purse, and their designs
reflect the most modern trend in motoring practice.
The day of the F.I.A.T. lias come. Business men appreciate the smaller models for their combination of economy, comfort and moderate price; while the luxury
of appointment, refinement and power of the larger models set a standard of value peculiarly F.I.A.T.
The Company intends to form a separate division to handle the wholesale and retail distribution of F.I.A.T. Cars, which will be under the personal control
of Mr. Beck, who has relinquished his position of general manager ofi Garratts, Ltd., for this purpose.
THE CHANDLER is in the very forefront of America’s fine cars. The Chandler agency includes the Cleveland Car, which in future will bear the name of
Chandler. Both cars are noted for their stamina, both have established remarkable records here and abroad, and their popularity and firm establishment here make the
agency a most valuable one for the Company.
THE PEUGEOT. —This French car satisfies that ever increasing demand for high-grade Continental cars. The reputation of the Peugeot and its remarkable
performance on Australian roads ensure its ready sale.
THE .JOWETT is a light British car, designed for efficiency and economy. While a comparatively newcomer on the Australian market, it has nevertheless won for
itself wide popularity by reason of the quality it offers for a limited investment.
THE RIGHT MEN
The value of highly-trained and efficient staff has been one of the main features upon which the Directors tiave concentrated their attention. In obtaining the
services of Mr. Roland 0. Clark as Managing Director, the Company has one who has been associated with the Motor Trade in Australia for the past seven years. During
the greater part of that time he was closely connected with the Motor Car business of Marcus Clark and Co., Ltd., in a managerial capacity, and last year visited America
for the purpose of studying conditions and matters generally at the American factories, and is therefore thoroughly equipped with the knowledge and experience for the
position he now holds.
Mr. Beck has relinquished his position of general manager of Garratt’s, Ltd., in order to join Consolidated Motors in the capacity of managing director.
Mr. Beck’s name is most favorably known in the Australian Motoring World, for prior to joining Garratt’s, Ltd., his eminently successful career as Sales
Manager for Williams Bros., Ltd., and John McGrath, Ltd., provided him with the widest possible experience.
Mr. R. Morgan Shaw, who will be the General Manager for the Chandler and Peugeot Division, has for the past two years been acting in a similar position in
the sale of Chandler and Cleveland Cars in New South Wales.
Mr. Forrest Finlay, formerly Sales Manager of Garratt’s, Ltd., will also be joining the new Company as Sales Manager of the F.I.A.T. Division. Few names
are better known or more widely respected than that of Mr. Finlay, whose long experience has brought him into personal contact with the many F.I.A.T. owners throughout
New South Wales.

Say WHEN Man!!
“Chloe”: The drought has affected almost
all forms of vegetation on the Darling
Downs (Q.). Wheat crops have dried oh
into short, yellow stubble, and kitchen vege-
tables have faded away. One tree, however,
has shown a stout resistance; the silky-oaks
are richer in bloom than ever. The magni-
ficent showing of gold and bronze in close-
grouped, heavy panicles is the finest I have
ever seen. They seem to mock their wilted
neighbors, and each one is thronged with
honey buzzards or leatherlieads, the grey-
green and bronze bird with the snake-like
head and strident voice. A Volstead Act
or something of the kind should be in force
against these raiders; they are simply noisily
drunk from 10 a.m. till dark, when they sink
to slumber. Bees and ants, too, get drunk
on the nectar of the flower. The ants stagger
about after the first half-hour, the bees drop
lazily to the ground, roll about for a while
trying to recover their balance, and then
attempt, more or less successfully, a short
flight to cover. The stages of drunkenness
in the birds is more marked. They are at
lhe discontented stage of having slept it off
when they begin their raid at daybreak. They
(iy lazily, fight for places, the males severely
punish the hens, and there is a raucous chal-
lenge in each note. The branches of the
golden tree hang with birds draining pan-
icle after panicle, and their voices change
—first to a gay and rollicking tone, at which
stage the male birds tell each other stories
with much chuckling, winking and innuendo.
The womenfolk drink on, making remarks
sotto voce, and exchanging in low tones their
domestic experiences. Now and then a
shrewish dowager goes after her spouse and
gives him a dressing down. About noon ail
have reached the sleepy stage, and a siesta
lasts till about three. Then the orgy begins
anew. It is not uncommon to see drunken
birds fall from bough to bough, or even to
the ground. They try to flap their wings,
and rise, but in vain ; all they can manage
is to make a staggering run to the nearest
cover. This is about the most disgraceful
exhibition of intemperance in the animal
world to come under my notice, and I would
like to draw the attention of the Y.W.C.A.
to it lest evil communications should cor-
rupt good manners in the bird world.

“Country Ped” : Perhaps if “Jesmond” (B.
28/10/’26) counted the cows running with
the bull or bulls in his dairy herd on differ-
ent occasions he might find some explanation
other than the weather for the changed
proportions of males to females in the
offspring. An experienced dairyfarmer and
stud breeder of my acquaintance works on
the principle that, the more cows per bull
in his herd, the greater the proportion of heifer
calves. Results seem to justify his conclu-
sions, for, when he had two bulls with forty
cows, between 60 and 70 per cent, of the
AFTER THE SPILL.
BOSS COCKY : “I thought you said you were a good rider?”
JACKY : “Bah, that plurry horse don’t know good rider when ’e see one!”
calves were males; now, with only one bull,
the result is reversed. With fowls, too, he
has found similar results.
* * * *
“Mirridong”: Every now and again some-
body discovers a fanciful and entirely erro-
neous meaning of “Wagga Wagga.” the
latest offender being “Older” (B. 28/10/’26),
who tells us it is aboriginal for “very foggy.”
“Wagga” means “crow,” and the repetition
of the word is the abo. method of expressing
the plural, “crows,” or “the place where
crows congregate in large numbers.” At
least that’s what the early Murrumbidgee
blacks said, and they ought to know. Like
numberless native place-names, the word is
onomatopoeic, and should be spelt “Wahga.”
the pronunciation being long-drawn out, in
imitation of the cry of the noxious bird.
While on the job, I might be permitted to
give the meanings of a few of the more im-
posing place-names near Wagga. Eunony-
hareenylia (usually shortened to Eunoiiy
locally) means “Eunong lives here,” Eunong
being a renowned dusky warrior of great
stature who made it his headquarters at
some remote period. Pomingalarna (“Oom-
ingalana” is what it should be) is the first
person singular present tense of the verb to
hit, strike or beat, or, as an old blackfellow
explained it to me, “I hit now.” Gobba-
gombalin is a turkey egg, or, more specifi-
cally, “one turkey egg.” Murrumbidgee is
“plenty water” or “big water.” The late
Archie Meston once stated in a newspaper
article that “Murrumbidgee” meant “the
black swan,” but Archie, undoubted autho-
rity as he was on the languages of the north-
ern blacks, often erred when he ventured
too far south.
“Wandi”: Bogong moths, which lately
have been invading Sydney suburbs in mil-
lions, were considered a delicious food by the
blacks of long ago. The clans made annual
visits to Kosciusko, Buffalo, Bogong and
other foothills for the feast, just as Queens-
land blacks gathered from all parts for the
ripening of the bunya fruit. Thousands of
moths were gathered from the rocks and
shrubs by day, and caught around the camp-
fires at night. The wings were pinched or
singed off, and the plump grub-like bodies
were then toasted on light coals, or roasted
in hot ashes. These moths feed by night on
the nectar of flowers, and when they appear
in plague proportions many apiarists have
to feed their bees to keep them from starving.
_ “Centre” : I’ve been playing private detec-
tive on a flighty lady magpie and her lover.
The lady and her husband met. courted and
mated, and had started to build their future
home when the third member of the eternal
triangle butted in. He waited till hubby
had left for more building material, and
then introduced himself to the lady, who
promptly and rightly resented his familiarity
and suggestions, and would have none of
him. The Don Juan slipped off just in time
to dodge the returning hubby, who, all un-
suspecting, got busy with the bidding and
then hurried off again for more timber. Back
came the home-breaker, and ardently re-
newed his attentions to the lady, who then
began to weaken rapidly, and finally showed
she rather enjoyed her conquest. Hubby
nearly caught them together when he again
returned, but the lady drew his attention to
herself while her admirer got safely out of
sight. Next morning Mrs. M. repulsed her
husband’s attentions, and there was a bit
of a row between them; but the old man
put his pride in liis pocket, apologised for
having been too pressing, and started off on
his job of getting more material for the home.
He had no sooner gone than the lady gave
the signal of “all clear’’ to her lover, and,
throwing pretence to the winds, openly wel-
WAS SWIMMING IN IT.
PARSON : “Dear, dear! Did — cr—poverty drive you to your criminal ways?”
PRISONER: “Not at all. I was simply coining money.”
coined him as lie came hurrying from the
cover of a near-by wattle-tree. Hubby re-
turned at the most inopportune moment, and,
without waiting for explanations, went bald-
headed for the home-breaker. It was a will-
ing go, but the lady, fickle as the rest of
her sex, mixed in with the fray. It was
a case of two to one, and the injured hus-
band was soon in serious trouble; so seri-
ous, in fact, that between them they had
l’-im badly beaten and bleeding about the
head, as they forced him down to the ground
and started to knock his brains out. It
was there that I stepped in and rescued him.
He spent two days under my care in au
empty hencoop, recovering, while his wife
and her lover carolled their mating song from
the tree above him. I released him then,
but he had no heart for further trouble, and
with a cry that might have been a curse
made off into the bush.
* * * *
“Fantas” : “Yairs,” remarked Dad, taking
his pipe from his teeth and pointing the
stem at a dog lying a few feet away, "that
there dorg’s a blinkin’ wonder, lie’s bin
trained so’s ’e can recernise ev’ry last one
of my sheep, an’ won’t have nothin’ to do
with no one else’s. A week ago I bought a
line of wethers from Paddy McGinty, brought
’em ’one and turned ’em in with mine. Two
days after I wanted to turn ’em into another
paddick, and sent the dorg out after ’em.
’E brought in mine orlright. but ’e wouldn’t
bring in them wethers. An’ ”—here Dad
lowered his voice and put on his most
impressive expression—“l ’ad ter show ’im
Paddy’s receipt afore he’d bring them
along.”

“Pfella” : We didn’t rely on China for our
fireworks in my younger days in the moun-
tain country of Victoria. For weeks before
November 5 ; all the bush boys of the district
would scour the mountains for “punk”—
large half-plates of white, grey, black and
red fungus which grew on the rotted side of
stumps and fallen trees. The collection was
then soaked thoroughly in kerosene for a
week. Perplexed mothers often wondered
why the lamp-wells ran dry so quickly, and
worried fathers generally flew off the handle
because they thought Mum had forgotten to
fill the hurricane-lamp. These oil-soaked
fungus chunks, stuck on sticks, would burn
brightly for hours, throwing out spears of
colored flame more impressive than all the
crackers from the Flowery Land.

Copper Rivet : Ants make no appeal to
me as economists of labor; they carry loads
over avoidable obstacles and fool round
their work m a way that would disgust
Henry Ford But they have homing m-
stmets and the bump of locality. I was at
one time in charge of a mustering camp out
Tliargommdah way, where I met Claypan
Jack, a dandy scrub-dasher, who always car-
ried a needle and thread recessed in his lid
to repair scrub damages to his clobber. I
saw him unravel a bit of thread, and, catch-
ing two well-grown meat-ants, carefully
adjust the strand of thread round their
waists, so that they could be easily identified,
“What’s the idea, Claypan?” I asked,
“Well,” lie says, “I’m going to carry them
in my quartpot on to the Tableland (three
miles away), and let them go, just to see if
they’ll be home when we meet here again to-
morrow.” I was first at the meeting-place,
and sure enough the ants were back at the
nest with the rest of the,tribe rushing around
them. Three miles in 24 hours was not bad
going for an ant.

“Spenner” : From my position on the cliff
I searched the gully below for signs of
rabbits, and having concluded there were
none in sight was about to move on. A fine
eagle floated around the bluff, hovered an in-
stant, then, with amazing speed, dived to
the ground. To my surprise he grabbed a
rabbit in his talons and was rising, when a
snake struck at him from the bush opposite.
With a backward lurch the eagle retaliated
with its heak, then rose with the quarry,
Prom the wriggling mass below I knew the
snake was disabled, so watched the eagle to
se e how he came out of the encounter. Half
a mile up the gully, in a towering redgum,
was a nest, and he made straight for it.
More than a quarter of a mile away I could
see him winging strongly. I had almost de-
cided that the snake’s thrust hadn’t got home
when I noticed the bird falter in flight, then
gradually come near the ground. The bunny
fell from its grasp. The eagle wavered as-
though about to regain his victim, changed
his mind and made a desperate effort to reach
the nest. The task proving beyond him, he
blundered on to a lower limb, balanced there
a moment, then fell to the ground. I examined
the snake and found the body almost severed
six inches from the head. I walked along to
tne gum and on the almost naked breast of
the dead eagle saw a purple patch a couple
of inches in diameter, and in the centre two
punctures. I searched for the rabbit where
I calculated he had fallen, but there was no
sign of him. Hollywood could teach old Dame
Nature nothing in the way of releasing a hero
from a seemingly impossible situation.

WOMAN'S
LETTER

SILK OR
CHAMOISETTE
GLOVES
The A.J.C. sent out cards for a day
with the horses last Saturday. This meeting
was an extra vitamine pushed into the pun-
ters’ mouths, as unexpected but as appreci-
ated as the titbits the ravens brought to
Elijah. A Randwick whose natural beauties
were not obscured by human deficiencies
smiled into the eyes of those who had time
to see, but the 30,000 or so at the meeting
were all rather busy picking winners, for
the favorites came home with a monotony
irritating to the ring. The stands were well
dressed, but not uncoolly so. Summer frockmg,
in spite of the grey morning, predominated,
hats were large, shoes were blonde, and legs
mounted on high-heeled shoes a bit more in
evidence than usual. Silk stitched hats were
on the smartest people, and embroidery
dresses were no hole and corner affair, but
were flaunted on every side.
Strathspey, in Macquarie-street, is the
present home of Sydney’s newest woman’s
club, the Macquarie. This is an offshoot of
the Queen’s, whose waiting list had become
nearly a mile long. Miss Pitt, who for some
years was a competent and popular aide to
the secretary of the Queen’s, has gained her
epaulette with star and is the fully-fledged
secretary of the Macquarie. The senior
club, by the way, has lost its president,
Miss Macarthur Onslow, who resigned to
go to Europe. Chief Justice Philip Street’s
lady has succeeded her.
Sydney Ure Smith’s first one-man show
drew Sydney’s brightest and best-dressed to
the Macquarie Galleries on an afternoon that
was all sunshine ruffled by sea breeze. The
Society of Artists rolled up to applaud its
president at the correct moments of Bertram
Mackennal’s opening speech, and the walls
of the two rooms simply danced with
pencilled light and shade. The creator
thereof, blue of eye and pink of cheek, tried
to look as unobtrusive as possible, and the
Mackennal lady added the flutterings of a
green fan and high green millinery to the
group while her sculptor held forth. Side-
tracking Sydney the artist, with the remark
“And I wonder what sort of homes these
works of delicacy are going into,” Mac-
kennal soon charged his favorite windmill —
the absence of line and color in the make-up
of Sydney tlie city. But there is something
to be said in defence. If every man who
builds a house—or a fence —knew as much
of art as a Mackennal or a Lambert, then
the artists in color and in stone might not
grow so full on the golden grain that the
man of commerce now scatters before them.
The beautiful cities of the Old World were
builded up, too, when labor was cheap—and
artists often cheaper. This Letter asked a
Digger friend about the Arab cities which
Mackennal described as rising like pearls
from the sea. The Digger said it depended
on the wind. He himself hadn’t been lucky.
Whenever he couldn’t get far enough away
from one it reminded him less of a pearl
than of a crayfish long past its prime.
And even as the sculptor talked of the
sordid look of the city, the big front window
of the Galleries framed as pretty a bit of
old stonework and shadowed and sunlit
greenery as any city could hold. From
across the way smiled the lawn of the Union
Club, the wind falling like a wave through
some tall palms that thrust laughing sun-
lit fronds out of a sea of shadow.
The Rachel Forster wing of the Infants’
Home at Ashfield, which was opened last
Tuesday, owes a cot or two to Mistress Mary
and Co. This was an entertainment rather
like a box of mixed sweets —so few with
ginger in them, but the sugar of the very best
quality and the wrappings a delight to the
eye. The programme was made up of
tableaux and one-act plays, sub-sectioned by
thistledown songs, and the girls taking part
were as pretty a posy of young things as
any city could produce. Vinia de Loitte
directed the “Recollections of Comic Opera,”
while Lily Titheradge saw to the production
of a fantasy by Gilbert Cannan and a clever
little satire by Gertrude Jennings.
The National Council of Women is terribly
thrilled just about the spot where the loyalty
rib rides at anchor. A communication by
special courier has just reached the Pitt-
street stronghold that the Duchess of York
will be present at an afternoon reception to be
arranged by the executive of the N.C.W. for
the members of women’s organisations. Mean-
time, on November 25, the councillors will
carry on with a general meeting at the Royal
Colonial Institute, when Sybil Morrison,
LL.B., will instruct them on the divorce laws
of the Australian States.
The wedding that attracted the largest
crowd of lookers-on last week was that of
ex-international footballer Felix Ryan to
Gladys Howard, of Enmore; the pair trysted
at St. Joseph’s, Newtown, for the exchange
of vows. The bride was a study in yellows
and golden browns, and the same color-note in
lighter tones was repeated in her brides-
maid’s raiment. The toasts and cake were
discussed at the home of the bride’s parents.
St. James’s wore the subdued gaiety of
lilies and pink gladioli one night last week
for the great surrender of Constance Philips,
daughter of the Sydney Philipses of Edge
cliff, to Henry Gamble, of Stratlifield. The
bride’s frock, a shimmering cascade of dia-
mente and crystal, was misted by billows
of tulle veil and followed by a sparkle of
train that was shooed on its right path by
Marjorie Kirkland, Mary Beale and Sadie
Wright in spreading taffetas of apricot hue.
The wedding meats were spread at the Am-
bassadors. where the wedding garment of the
bride’s mother —of powder-blue georgette and
lace—was a thing to look at twice.
Another descendant of that Governor King
who did so much to populate Australia
entered into holy wedlock the other day. He
was Charles Macarthur Gidley King, of
Goonoo Goonoo, and his white and silver
bride was Eileen Berry, of Tamworth. St.
John’s Anglican Church at Tamworth housed
the nuptials, and Canon Fairbanks and
Padre E. G. Higgin tied the knot. Rita
Berry and Adah King ’maided in cherry
georgettes, against which they carried posies
of dark-red rosebuds tied with apple-green
streamers. The local Oddfellows’ Hall was
hard put to it to accommodate the wedding
guests. >
Incidentally, this Letter wonders why Gov-
ernor King has never been immortalised as
he deserves. When the new St. Margaret’s
Hospital for Babies arises, it would be a
pretty compliment to name one of the wards
the “Governor King.”
A pretty bride who has had the eye of
Hobart turned on her is Mrs. J. Brennan,
who was Mary McNally of Sydney. She
is a cousin of Father McNally of the Channel
districts, one of Tasmania’s most popular
padres, and his friends have given the honey-
inooners a great time. Two outstanding
memories are the apricot orchards and a
party given by the Tom Murdoch couple.
Here came Captain Ghcrtson, once of the
King of Sweden’s suite, now on his way to
join the latest Antarctic whaling expedition,
and other members of the great killing party.
These helped his Ex. to make the Come-to-
Tasmania race meeting in the afternoon as
bright as an aluminium platter.
Monte Luke’s camera caught the sparkle
in Vinia de Loitte’s eye when she was reviv-
ing an old Gil-
bert and Sul-
livan experi-
ence of her
late husband,
Howard Ver-
non. Vinia,
who is like a
streak of
q u i c ksilver,
was one of the
enthusiasts re-
sponsible for
the “Mistress
Mary” revue
at the Adyar
Hall a few
days ago. Her
“Recollections
of Comic
Opera” were
a laugh from
beginning to
end, and ex-
plain her enor-
mous popularity with listeners-in all over
Australia. The clever and energetic little
actress composes the music of her own tune-
ful sketches, and writes the lyrics as well,
and she can take any part in a production
from stage-carpenter to lead. When not
engaged in one of a hundred other interests
Vinia is busy making her garden one of the
beauty spots of Long Nose Point.
Sheila Baverstock, having made the tour of
St. Philip’s, entering the Church Hill mar-
riage-market a spinster and emerging a
matron, took the kiss of congratulation at
the Wentworth, side by side with her brand-
new husband, Lionel Wigmore. The slim
bride wore for the great occasion a princess-
in-the-fairy-tale frock of cobwebby gold lace,
lined with peach bloom, against which she
clasped a sheaf of yellow roses and topaz
gladioli. Sister Dorothy, who ’maided, added
a jade green and crystal frock to the picture.
This was a very designing dress that radi-
ated romance, and suggested moonlight and
gondolas and the barcarolle from Hoffmann.
Bride’s mother, in ivory satin and brown
lace raiment, and Mrs. Wigmore, above the
richness of black velvets, smiled a further
benediction. The wedding meats were served
on the balcony above the ballroom, and here
uncle Percy Hunter made the speech of the
evening, often witty and occasionally pretty.
Every newspaper in Sydney was represented
at the party, for Sheila had been on the staff
of the Sun, and her ’groom helps the Tele-
graph every day and in every way to grow
better and better.
If Eve had had the eye for color and line
possessed by Ethel King (alongside), the
serpent, in-
stead of being
the cause of
tlieir eviction
from the Gar-
den, might
have been an
object of pro-
fit to the first
lady in the
land and her
husband. Miss
King, who
comes from
Lismore way,
has recog-
nised snakes
on sight from
earliest in-
fancy, and as
a small girl
she filled the
margins of her
books with
sketches of the
lizards 1 and frogs and snakes of her acquaint-
ance. Later on she decided to study art,
and went into the studios of Julian Ashton
and Dattilo Rubbo. But her naturalist in-
stinct proved so strong that presently she
found herself working in the Flower Museum
in the Botanic Gardens. For four years her
pencil and brush were busy on the forest
flora of Mr. Maiden’s massive work; and
then the Museum in College-street claimed
her. Here the serpent once more exercised
its lure, and she spends her day painting the
plaster casts of him so accurately that bush
men cannot enter the Museum without a
pocket-flask. Miss King is responsible for
the magnificent colored plates which illus-
trate the article on snakes in the second
volume of “The Australian Encyclopaedia,”
lately published by Angus and Robertson.
Mention of Miss King calls to memory the
delicate work of another tireless enthusiast,
Margaret Flockton, an artist who passed 20
years of her life in the museum in the gar-
dens. Much of that time was spent in illus-
trating Mr. Maiden’s “Critical Revision of
Eucalypts.”
Dr. Helen Margaret Braye, who has for
some years doctored the North Shore line
in partnership with Dr. Harriet Biffin, is
hypnotising her women patients with a new
engagement ring. Colonel Frederick Street,
D. 5.0., of Newcastle, the man who placed
it in position, is one of the industrial city’s
solicitors. His war record is as shining as
his best girl’s brass plate—he will be remem-
bered by the 30th Battalion of the A.I.F.
as their C.O. on the Western Front. Dr.
Helen herself claims Newcastle as her home-
town.
The tense excitement that filled the corri-
dors of Parliament House last week was
shivered for a fleeting second while Romance
had an innings. On the eve of the political
sensation of the year one of the most popular
officers of the House, Alan Pickering, of
Drummoyne, announced the news of his
engagement to Marjorie Myee Turnbull, the
dark-haired typist of W. F. Foster, an
Eastern Suburbs Nationalist member. Mar-
jorie, who combines concert-singing with
Girl Guiding, is a native of Auburn, the
suburb where Premier Lang has his estate-
agency.
Marjorie Rose, now of Ashfield, once of
Farnham (Eng.), will take the roses of her
cheeks and the sparkle of her eyes to bloom
in Papua next year; and the young man who
is luring her there is Charles Karius. He
has been Assistant Resident Magistrate
there for seven years, and before that was
at the war. Charlie, who became engaged
during a recent special leave, was at latest
setting out on three months’ patrol work of
the Mandated Territory, where, besides admin-
istering justice, he hopes to add to that
knowledge which has made him an F.R.G.S.
The Wentworth is to be turned into some-
thing that is first-cousin to a Persian garden
for the wedding of Linda Scott Fell to
Colonel Wheeler on Saturday next.
Another newspaper girl is hanging an
engagement-ring on the nail above her type-
writer every morning. She is tall, fair-
haired Vera Thatcher, and her young man
is Captain Jack Hamilton.
One gentleman who prefers blondes is
Donald Campbell, of Shanghai. He has
obtained a promise from the golden-haired
Miss Ellis, who was for so long comman-
dant of the V.A.D.’s in charge of the Blinded
Soldiers’ Cafe, to sign up with him early
next year.
A neat little cheque for £463 was handed
by Mayoress Cecilia Walsh to the Mother
Superior of the Mater Hospital last week.
It was the result of the September ball, and
the amount and the appearance of the trea-
surer. Mrs. Leahy, who is just recovered from
an illness, filled the afternoon with felici-
tations.
Sydney Grammar now boasts a residen-
tial establishment. It is Rathven, a beau-
tifully-situated house in St. Mark s-roatl,
Randwick. The grounds are wide, and trees
lend their shade and flowers tlieir brilliance
to well-kept lawns. On Saturday Chief
Justice Street and ex-C.J. Cullens ladj
opened the Quick fete, by which wives and
daughters of Old Sydneians hope to help the
new venture by a thumping cheque. Ihe
fgfe was a triumph of pretty assistants and
eager buyers.
The Dickens Fellowship put in a happy
morning on Friday at the Prince Edward,
when “Little Dorrit” lived again to their
delight in a well-produced film. Elaine de
Chair was among those who hung upon the
pictured story of the sweet youngster who
was born in the debtors’ prison to poverty,
left it a little wistfully as an heiress, and
returned to it to find her romance.
The auction of the Little Collection has
made the talk of the tea-tables for the last
few days. It is the most comprehensive
one-man gathering Sydney has made, and it
was disintegrated in the rooms of James
Lawson, with whom the owner used to be
in partnership. Prices, on the whole, were
not startling for the precious bits and
pieces, and a few were put aside. Of course
there were surprises. One suburban lady who
took a fancy to a quaintly-turned chair
and breathlessly made the first bid of i <
was amazed at the laugh that burst from
the little circle about her. The man next
to her raised the bid by £5O, and when
the price had soared over the hundred-guinea
mark the lady was seen gazing with a
puzzled frown at the chair. An early
eighteenth-century sundial fashioned like a
sunflower was without a motto. The couple
who bought this rather felt they weren’t
getting their value till assured by the One
Who Knows that mottoes are of the frivol-
ously modern times of the late Louis and
those elegant youngsters Herrick and Suck-
ling.
Miss Brisbane whirls around brides: —
Irene Smith, who is marrying Clive Mellor on
December 2, has had acres of traycloths spread in
her honor. Denise D’Ennet decorated Rewa with
roses and cornflowers and yellow daisies for a party.
The bride-elect was in periwinkle-blue, with white
hat, and the hostess wore a French broidered frock
of tomato color. At Wilston, Sybil Lucas and
Linda Bell had a tennis party in a decoration of
cerise-pink and cream, with cerise blossomry, place
cards and gift-box for the guest. Roses decorated
Ruth McLennan’s home, where tennis was played,
and Thelma and Elsie Nagel had a tea at Lennon’s,
with a background of pink gerberas and gladioli.
Matrix-blue and guipure and a black crinoline hat
dressed the bride-to-be. A presentation of Dutch
pottery was made. Rowe’s cafe staged a tea given by
Mrs. Woodley. There were bowls of Penelope roses in
puffs of wine-hued tulle, decorated with rose-colored
bon-bons and blue love-birds, and an ivory and
silver flower for the bride-elect’s place.
Bruce Lucas is marrying Millie Baker on the
16th, and Effie Howard had a party for her at
Whybena, Hamilton. The hostess wore beige, with
Margot lace, and the guest of honor was in rose-
pink Shantung, with a white hat.
Mabel Zillman was entertained at the Women’s
Club before leaving for the Cold Country. Florence
Micheli fixed up a musical programme, to which
Barbara Sisley, Lena Hammond, Jean Barlow and
Nancy Muirhead contributed.
The New Farm bowlers did up their club house
with gay streamers, gerberas and daisies for a
dance, supper being on verandahs enclosed with flags.
L. Marks and Mrs. Solomon gave the glad hand to
a big roll-up, and Emmie Stewart’s orchestra played.
A heavy storm made rattling accompaniment to
Dr. E. S. Jackson’s lecture on Australian Historical
Books, but did not damp the enthusiasm of the
members of the Authors and Artists’ Association
assembled to listen. Dr. Cumbrae Stewart presided,
and there was a display of rare editions of Aus-
tralian early histories. Some good lantern slides
illustrated. Professor J. J. Stable spoke a piece,
and Merna Gillies fixed up the music.
The Haymens had a dance for the English boys
at Indooroopilly, and the Richard Clarkes had
them out at Clovelly.
Eddie and Decima McLean, with Eric Masters, in
their “Pig-tail Alley,” are at the Empire. The
McLeans have not been seen here - since Decima’s
marriage to Eric Masters, but they have a good
many pals in Brisbane.
Count di San Marzano, the new Italian Consul, had
his first official reception this week. Archbishop
Duhig was on hand to give a greeting.
Dorrie Kathleen Atkinson, of Cashmere station,
back o’ Cairns, and of Vaucluse, Sydney, has con-
fessed her engagement to John Champneys, of Glen-
holme, Mackinlay.
Brisbane’s “no-coat” campaigners were lucky to
strike a sultry day for the opening of the offensive,
but even with that the results were not spectacular.
A majority of men, however, showed their willing
ness to go half-way by discarding their waistcoats.
A tally in Queen-street on the opening day showed
only 10 per cent, of male pedestrians without jackets,
but as 60 per cent, were without vests, the Crusaders
claim a sort of a victory.

The Rooms
Nearly 2000 visitors roamed upstairs and
downstairs and in my lady’s chamber on
the Otranto when the shit) was used for a
dance to aid the Melbourne and Alfred hos-
pitals. Tickets were only a half-guinea, and
the crowd that jazzed to the music made by a
rattling good band was not entirely com-
posed of dukes and countesses. The main
deck was glorified with gum-tips, a brave
array of flags and thousands of lights.
Though the liner was in port only a few
hours the arrangements were practically
perfect. There wasn’t even a scramble for
supper, which was served decorously in the
saloon. People who didn’t gyrate played
bridge or lounged and chatted in the writing-
room. The ticket secretaries were Mrs. E.
A. Spowers, who sparkled in bead fringe
attached to; petunia-pink raiment, and Mrs.
Edgar Dye,, whose flame-toned covering also
glistened. Princess MelikolT, whose gown was
hidden beneath a striking brocade evening
coat, was in the company of Mrs. Charlie
Lyon, whose gown of soft, pink was worn
with a coat of gold and green lame. I lorotliy
Merritt’s tall form arrested the eye in a
frock of pink and silver. Mrs. G. Plante
was a study in pink pearls and blending geor-
gette. There was a glimmer of green frock
under Mrs. Richard Pitcher's cape of henna
and gold tones. Floyd McComb came in
almond-green, and Mrs. Weston Pett's black
gown radiated in silver and diamente. The
committees of the two hospitals were, of
course, represented.
The Harry Emmertons’ home, Raveloc, was
turned into a bazaar last week when mem-
bers of the South Yarra section of the Child-
ren’s Hospital Auxiliary staged a “cafe chan-
tant with bridge.” Stalls banked witli
flowers, toys and other trifles were crowded
into every corner, and clearing up afterwards
must have been a job. The hostess, however,
was rewarded by the knowledge that £lOOO
was netted, a record for an effort of the kind.
The ballroom, gay with foliage and rhodo-
dendrons, was the cafe cliantaut, artists from
J.C.W. theatres contributing dancing and
other turns. Angela Baddeley, in a high-
waisted gown of ivory brocade, warbled Scot-
tish folksongs, and Renee Kelly, wearing
lace and filmy di aperies of biscuit hue, was
one of the performers in a sketch. In the
evening some of the Con. students, backed
up by Bruce Green, George Brooke and
Edward Cahill, supplied entertainment. Lady
Somers dropped in at afternoon-tea time in
a frock of floral-patterned ninon topped by
a bois-de-rose straw hat. Mrs. Emmerton,
wearing soft grey apparel with a hat bright-
ened with mauve flowers, handed over a posy
of red roses. Mrs. Norman Brookes, who
lent her mother much aid in arranging the
affair, was jn summery painted chiffon rose
traced with a shady hat. Mrs. James Ains-
lie secretaried the undertaking, with Mrs.
Fred Krcrouse and Mrs. Lindsay Dougharty
as ticket secretaries.
The Morells further opened their mayoral
term with a theatre party. About 90 mem-
bers of the City Council and its depart-
mental heads, with their womenfolk,
were taken to the King’s Theatre to see
“Mary Rose.” There was a bite and sup at
the Windsor afterwards, and the feast was
beautifully served. The new Mayor pro-
posed the health of the Royal George, and
ex-Mayor Brunton offered the usual con-
gratulations to the new civic chiefs. Mrs.
Morell was in black lace with a touch of gold
upon her black wrap, and daughter Sheila
figured in a frock of cherry-red lace and
georgette. When she shed her velvet coat
of shades of mauve and purple, the Brunton
lady disclosed a simple black robe. Aider-
man Jeffries’s wife was also in black,
cheered with diamente. Councillor Felix
Lloyd’s wife was all pink pearls and rose-
pink velvet. Town Clerk McCall, who is
off for a trip to England shortly, brought his
sister in a wrapping of flame hue with gold
and red scintillations.
On Friday afternoon, at the Russell
Clarkes’ South Yarra home, Mrs. Pitt
Rivers said good-bye to friends made during
her six years in Australia. The period com-
prises her dad’s term as G.-G. and the few
months she has been Mary Hinton of the
Boucicault company. She said her fare-
wells in an ensemble gown of fawn geor-
gette with bordering of gold and brown
embroidery; her small straw hat was In
unison. Mrs. Russell Clarke was picturesque
in a frock of apricot pink with touches of
powder blue, topped by a wide-leafed hat
with pink roses. The special charm about
the adornment of the reception-rooms was
the array of old-fashioned flowers in deep
silver bowls. Church and stage mingled;
Archgaiters Lees was there, and the guests
included the ladies playing in the just-con-
cluded season of Barrie plays. Dressing
was very smart, and everyone dangled strings
or ropes of pearls, pink ’uns being greatly
favored. Frank Clarke’s lady was a sym-
phony in shot mauve, blue and pink hues. Ella
Payne wore a pink frock and a large feather-
edged hat. Ex-Mayor Brunton’s lady, who
is off for a well-earned holiday abroad in
February, sported accordeon-pleated frills in
pewter blue, black and coral on a black
gown. Mrs. Byron Moore accompanied her
daughter, Mrs. Ronald Gordon, whose lace
gown and picture hat were embellished with
silver buckles. Mrs. Herbert Power wore
black lace over white and a black toque.
Mrs. Norman Falkiner, Mrs. \V. .1. T. Clarke
and daughter Wilma, Marney Clarke, Mrs.
Gilrutli and sundry Grimwades, Lemprieres
and Winter-Irvings were in the throng. Mrs.
Pitt Rivers left on Tuesday by the Nar-
kunda to join her two boys for Christmas.
For the remaining performances of “Mary
Rose” Mrs. Norman Macowan will play Mrs.
Qtery, the role in which “Mary Hinton”
was so successful.
A. A. Milne’s “Ariadne” was presented at
the Playhouse by the Old Grammarians’
Dramatic Society on a recent eveniiig. Irene
Webb was tin; producer, and the piece was
well put on. The ladies’ evening frocks in the
first scon e had for setting a drawing-room
with vellum-toned walls. Bessie Williams
was Ariadne; her problem, the extent to
which a dutiful wife should flirt with her
husband’s rich client for the sake of busi-
ness. Mabel Fairweather, Roma Smith and
Dorothy Vollugi had nice parts, and the
men were better than we’ve any reason to
expect a group of amateurs to be. "Little
Housebound,” by Ngaio Marsh, served as a
curtain-lifter. There were pretty flowers for
all the pretty ladies at the curtain. Miss
E. Davidson, the head-mistress, the Old
Grammarians’ president (Mrs. Eric Gutte-
ridge), Mrs. Herbert Brookes, Mayoress
.Moroll and daughter Shiela and a whole
horde of past and present students gave thun-
derous applause.
Appeals for Christmas cheer for various
charities and hospitals are heard again. Mrs.
A. E. Debney was the organiser of a garden
fete on Saturday to brighten the Yuletide
for the patients of the Eye and Ear. All
the auxiliaries and hospital workers rallied
round and manned stalls; and the Mayoress
went along to give an opening benediction.
Three little girls ran a stall stocked with
things calculated to please children like them-
selves —quite a happy thought. The weather
was fine and the returns ought to be satisfac-
tory.
The opening of the sailing season was pre-
ceded by a dance at the new club-house of
the Royal St. Kilda Yacht Club, Commodore
White and his wife doing the honors. And
on Saturday afternoon, when the white sails
were spread for the first time this season, tea-
cloths were spread too at the club house,
with Mrs. White again the hostess.
It is six years since this cheerful-looking
lady. Gertrude Johnson, set out from Mel-
bourne to gain
fame and for-
tune overseas
with a sunny
smile and a
golden soprano
voice. Almost
as soon as she
set foot in the
Big Smoke
she wo n a
place in opera,
and now is
well known on
the English
concert plat-
form. Lately
the Columbia
G r a mophone
Co. signed a
contract with
her for records
of her most
s u c c e s sful
numbers. Miss
Johnson, who holds the “crowning glory”
theory about hair, is pictured here by
Vaughan and Freeman, of London. It is one
of the treasures brought back by her mother,
who has just come home after a long visit
to her daughter.
The widow of George Turner, The Bul-
letin’s “little man with the brown hat,”
who made the best Treasurer Victoria ever
knew, has just passed away. She used to
be hailed as the local Mrs. Malaprop, but
what matter? —she was a kindly soul, quite
destitute of swank and frills. Yet but for
her George would probably have been con-
tent to be a fairly successful city solicitor;
it was she urged him up the ladder. She
accompanied him to the Diamond Jubilee
celebrations in London in 1897, but in later
yei’.rs she kept well in the background, and
it was at her wish that even the funeral was
strictly private. The death of their only
son, 25 years ago, was a smashing blow to
both of the parents.
Mrs. W. B. Adamson, with wide-brimmed
black velvet hat topping a gown of jade-
green, spread the cloth at the Austral Salon
when the Women’s Auto Club president, Mrs.
H. J. Robertson, Muriel Cheek and Dr. Bar-
tolini sang, and Louie Dunn spake some
verses. Professor Dunn gave a talk about
names. Hester Adamson, in blue georgette
with ribbon embroidery and blending crin.
millinery, helped her mother. In the throng
were the president of the Salon, Mrs. Thomas
Baker, Mrs. John Adamson, Mrs. Louis
ixelken and Councillor Angela Booth.
The Girl Guides and their destinies ruffled
the brows of the very highest when inter-
state delegates met at Federal Government
House to fix up a Federal Council for the
movement. Lady Stonehaven ruled over the
meeting, and Lady Somers was there as State
Commissioner. Walter James’s lady and
Margaret Brown were the Westralian depu-
tation ; Elsie Smith and Olive Kelso King
spoke for N.S.W., and Doris Gaggin repre-
sented Tasmania.
This is Isobcl Langlands, who wrote
“Songs of the Bush for Children, ’ in
which merry
verses are set
to happy tunes.
Poets usually
steer clear of
the platypus,
the iguana
and the blue-
tongued lizard,
but Miss Lang-
lands is no
craven, and she
has made the
beasties behave
themselves in
metre. T li e
little songs
were written
originally for
the delectation
o f small
nephews and
nieces. They
liked them so
much, and so
did other youngsters, that their authoress-
composer was encouraged to offer them to a
music-publishing firm outside Australia.
Later she bought back the rights, and now
an all-Australian edition is on the market
in time to make a very suitable Christmas
gift. Clever illustrations by a promising
young black-and-white artist, Quentin G.
Sutton, are a feature. The picture of Miss
Langlands is by Broothorn.
Students of Albert-street Con. gave their
end-of-the-year concert at the Assembly
Hall last week. There was a regular galaxy
of white-frocked lassies, mostly singers, and
only one young man, to whom pity went out.
Ida Walker, a contralto from Maoriland,
sang two of Schumann’s lyrics, and Phyllis
Webb, from Adelaide, was heard in the
“Romance” of Debussy. Among home-grown
contributors Eileen Thomson, a songbird,
and Margot Mac Gibbon, a fiddler, took this
Chatterer’s ear; and Mary Hotham and
Dorothy Richmond made the concert grand
behave nicely. The Con. will be silent from
December 12 to February 21.
When Admiral King-Hall was in charge of
the Australian station he and his lady made
lots of friends. Now daughter Louisa has
engaged herself to an Australian athlete,
Alastair McLeod, and their mai*riage is to take
place at an early date. The prospective bride
and her sister Magdalen own Quinton Castle
in Ireland, which descends to the, women-
folk of the family. Miss Magdalen has lately
achieved fame by producing “The Diary of
a Young Lady of Quality.”
Wedding-bells rang at All Saints’, St.
Kilda, the other evening for Sue Boyce, who
was christened Margaret Marie, and Harold
Hambly, scion of a Ballarat family. The
diminutive bride trailed a billowy tulle train
from a frock of ivory lace and silver lame.
Her attendant maid was Eileen Ham, a
study in hyacinth mauve in taffetas gown and
crinoline millinery. At Carlyon’s 60 guests
feasted. The lady’s popular father, J. C.
Boyce, for many years directed the Govern-
ment Tourist Bureau.
The New Gallery show of pictures by Dora
Wilson and .T. Collins was launched by
Mrs. Jimmy Dyer, a slim silhouette in fawn
satin, with a tall-crowned black crinoline
hat and a posy of crimson roses. Miss
Wilson, who spent months upon Melbourne's
highways and byways with paintbox and
easel, the centre, usually, of an admiring
throng, presents the harvest of her sowing,
and it is a very attractive garnering. The
purchase sign appeared, straight away, upon
many of the canvases. Miss Wilson is to
visit London in March with Pegg Clarke, the
photographer.
The rag-shops and hatteries didn't rake in
much of a harvest in Cup week. The peculi-
arities of Melbourne’s climate are so well
understood that even the most inveterate of
gamblers didn’t care to take the risk of
putting much on winter, spring or summer
for a place in the weather handicap, home
there were who took delivery of fine-weather
raiment, and then, at the end of the week,
returned the gay attire unused—or at least
that was the story. One lady, who sought
to get a particularly beautiful cloak taken
off her bill, and who was gently told it could
not be, was furious until it dawned upon
her that she had forgotten to remove certain,
theatre ticket-butts from a pocket.
Teddy Cahill and Brooke are booked for
concerts at the Assembly Hall, on December
2 and 4. Lady Stonehaven has promised
to come.
One of the London-bound passengers by
the Otranto was Gloster Downing, who
has been given the job of arranging motor
transport for the Yorks, and will superintend
the shipment of a fleet of Crossleys. He
will return in the Renown.
Mrs. Harry Green will stay on in Mel-
bourne while her husband spies out the land
in London, which has not yet seen “Give and
Take.”
The National Gallery has purchased Hans
lleysen’s "The Edge of the Clearing” for
£225. This is the first really characteristic
Heysen the trustees have acquired.
The William Cameron couple will hand
over their Mt. Macedon home, whose garden
is one big picture, to the Victoria League
on December 4 for a fete to help the
Women’s Institute to build a hall. The
Gisborne Shire Council has given a site at
M acedon.
We have had three Art shows to look at.
chief among them Hans Heysen's at the
Fine Arts Gallery. The South Australian
showed only three dozen pictures, eight of
which were reserved, and three sold before
the private view. These oils and water-colors
are not all devoted to the glory of the gum—
the waves that roll upon the south coast
are depicted and there are other seascapes
and some pictures of flowers and fruit.
Raymond Ellis, a capable experienced bari-
tone with a good voice, gave a recital at the
Auditorium lately. Mr. Ellis came here
under contract to the Firm, and his thunders
have regularly impinged upon the ether via
the 3LO station. At present he is consider-
ing an offer from London to appear in the
provinces in the role of Schubert in “Lilac
Time.” His best offerings last week were
Massenet’s “Vision Fugitive”; and “La
Belle Dame Sans Merci,” by Villiers Stan-
ford. An effectively-written little song,
“Poppies,” by Linda Phillips, found a place
in the programme.
A. Lot time in an old town: —
Hobart has just been through a crowded week in
connection with the “Back to Tasmania” 10 days.
The Elwiclc races on Saturday afternoon and the per-
formance by amateurs of “The Toreador” were purple
patches. Mrs. Benson trained the performers and
produced the show, which ran to full houses for four
nights. On Monday night everything that could toot
and trundle, from motor-lorries and fire-engines down
to scooters, lined up in a torch-light procession. On
Tuesday the O’Grady opened a “Made in Tasmania”
exhibition, a monument to three or four women
organisers, with Mrs. Moore as sec. On Wednesday
the Lyceum Club had a great night, welcoming its
president, Mrs. Henry Dobson, just returned from
W.A., and its vice, Mrs. Stourton, who has been to
the Cold Country.
Sister Adelaide’s annals:—
The South Aus. Orchestra rang down the curtain
on its 1926 season with an excellent concert, the
Bach Society sharing the honors. The Wedding-
Feast from Coleridge Taylor’s “Hiawatha,” wiih
Fred Stone as soloist, was the item of the programme,
which closed with Tschaikowsky’s F Minor symphony.
A mass of: flowers went up to Sylvia Whitington,
the orchestra’s leader.
Mrs. H. K. Wendt, just back from England, has
high praise for the English-Speaking Union and its
power in arranging hospitality and sight seeing for
touring Australians. The local branch is planning-
some touring on its own account, and a special train
of English-Speakers, bound on a five days’ jaunt to
Canberra, is due to leave in daily December.
The George McEwins, just back from England,
were the cause of a special session of one-time Cheer-
IJp Hut workers. He -was one of the Hut's keenest
supporters and is still its president (the organisa-
tion is kept intact in case of future need), and his
fellow members arranged a welcome-home tea-party
for him and his wife at the Carlton.
The Talbot Smiths are included in the list of
intending voyagers overseas next year. The Kyffm
Thomases are staying on the other side of the world
till February.
Practise polo continues at Birkalla with an increas-
ing number of players each Saturday and an enthu-
siast or two to cheer them on. Saturday’s tea host
was Paul Teesdale Smith, who had a nasty fall in
the second chukker.
Poppy Day brought in close on £9O0 —an excellent
result for a post-war effort.
Professor Strong said an appreciative word or
two at the opening of Isabel Haynes’s collection
of water-colors. The artist is just back from Europe
and her pictures (delightful, some of them) are
mostly of England and France and Italy; but
there are glimpses of the Adelaide hills and some
pleasing still-life studies.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
But for Orient Princess (Sands of the
Orient —Princess B) and Fondant (Cyllene More—
Bon Bon), MacShortodds would have had a losing
day at Randwick on Saturday, and losing days at
Randwick, as far as he is concerned, are rare. There
was so little money for Orient Princess in the
Flying Handicap that Mac lengthened the odds to
25 to 1 (the tote paid just on that and two other
divs. as well), and when White Fang (7 to 2), a
speedy customer from Maoriland, hit the front at
the half-distance, having disposed of Persuasion,
Orient Princess, though making up ground, seemed
to have little chance. But Ellis rode a more vigor-
ous finish on the mare than Davidson did on the
gelding, and amidst the groans of White Fang’s
backers, the Princess cut him out of it by a head.
Aeneid, one of those smart Greenstead three-year-
olds, showed a lot of pace for a time, and will very
likely win when the beef and the weight come
down. She may be reckoned a Carrington Stakes
possibility.
The same Ellis rode Fondant in the £750 Novem-
ber Handicap, and very cleverly withal. Fondant,
who is owned and trained by William Kelso, had
failed persistently at seven furlongs and a mile in
Trial Handicaps and the like, but William Kelso,
junior, was confident that the little bay would'
shape better over a distance among the moderates
now racing, and so it proved, though the stable
commission (at 15 to 1) was, very small. Stealing
a march on the other jockeys, Eilis set up a lead
of many lengths. Hunter, on Hinchinbrook, was the
first to realise the clanger, and at one stage this big
black mare looked like catching him, but she went
to pieces in the straight, and Fondant, spurting
when called upon, won by seven lengths from Con-
fusion (6 to 1), an unfortunate beast, with Gleam
Boy (6 to 1) a poor third, and Tibbie (7 to 2) next.
The winner proved himself a decent stayer (lie ran
the 12 furlongs in 2min. 33sec.), but condition did a
lot for him—in that respect he had the advantage
over every other starter, except perhaps Tibbie —and
so did Ellis. Real Mackay, evidently a horse of
moods, was galloping well 'when the race was over.
It is a long time since there was a really first-
class horse of John “Baron’s” breeding, but Crystal-
lised Glass (Wallace Isinglass—Smart Walk) is pretty
good. Backed down to 5 to 2 for the Three-year-old
Handicap, seven furlongs, this contented-looking chest-
nut —manj' “Baron”-bred homes are fretful, washy
things—made hacks of a big field in lmin. 25fsec.,
time which is rarely excelled at Randwick, and it
seems a pity she missed the Oaks. Of the defeated
lot, Fujisan’s elder brother, Valparaiso, though just
cut out of a place, seems the most likely to im-
prove. Greenline (Greenstead —Ayrline) and Chro-
mium (Chrysolaus—Sweet Lady), two youngsters in
Jim Barden’s stable, were first and second in the
Nursery Handicap; Greenline went out at 5 to 2
in a field of 22, and Chromium returned a £lO
divvy, on the 10s. tote. No one rides a last race
more artistically tnan Pike, and the accomplished
Jimmy was at his best on St. Eaton (3 to 1) in the
Ilighweight Handicap; Otacre (20 to 1) and All Home
(8 to 1), who was in all manner of trouble, helped
to make the finish interesting. St. Eaton, who is
by Eaton Lad —Savrinrie, has come on a lot since
he was a lathy three-year-old, and should go a good
mile and a quarter at least.
Melbourne punters crashed once more on
Saturday—at Epsom this time. They came at Vala-
mita again for the Epsom Handicap, 10 furlongs,
only to see All Sunshine bob up for the first time
since Connolly’s cast-off landed the Bagot Handicap
just on two years ago. Always a good track gal-
loper, All Sunshine had slipped his supporters up on
numerous occasions; but going out at 5 to 1 on
Saturday, and galloping generously for Jones, he
went to the front before the home turn was reached
and won well by nearly two lengths from the Toorak
Handicap heroine, Abdera, with the fast-finishing
Valamita, on whom the owner tried yet another
jockey, half a length away. All Sunshine covered
the distance in 2min. Sjsee. Bethanga (7 to 4),
who had run second to Metellus in the Moonga
Handicap at Caulfield, on the second day of the
Spring meeting, was the only favorite to succeed;
Jones, riding all he knew, just managed to get
him home ahead of Shaheen (8 to 1), who finished
well, with ill-starred King Val and Baririghup a
dead heat for third. Royal Feast’s brother, King
Osric (10 to 1), downed a supposed stone moral
in Savadeen (5 to 4) in the Mile Welter —T. M.
Burke owns the King, and Tom Bourke, ridden by
J. Burke, was third —and the 1924 V.R.C. St.
Leger winner, Sandringham, placed another victory
to his credit —in the Jumpers’ Flat. There was
support for this run-to-seed aristocrat, whose closing
price was 3 to 1, but Merry Boy, conqueror of a.
poor lot in the Brush Steeple, went out unbacked.
* * * *
“Tabra” : Sixteen horses were backed to
win, in the aggregate, £41,580 at the calling of
the card for the Queensland Cup the night before
the race. The bookmakers’ share, at the shortest
odds laid, was ,£2035. The only horse neglected
was Bright Grain, who was offered at 1000 to 6,
with no takers. Before the race, owner J. Kelly,
himself a bookmaker at Toowoomba, took £5OO
to £5, “just for the sake of the odds.” And the
despised outsider proved the best of good things!
“Ascot”: Review, who won a Novice Handicap
for pearler Jim Clark at the Queensland Cup meet-
ing, is the first , Valais to score in the Banana State.
Review preceded Manfred into the ring at the
Randwick yearling sales, and brought 1400 guineas
—lOO guineas more than the champion. This was
his first win—and it was worth only £2lO, though
he had picked up a bit of place money.
TAKING NO CHANGES.
BARMAID : “You’ve been wetting the baby’s

A wonderful old nag is St. Speed. Handi-
capped at lost. 31b. for a Welter at S.A. Tattersall’s
meeting, he was backed down to 6 to 4 in a field of
17, and won on the bit. Now in his 11th year, the
gelding has earned £9OOO in stakes for R. E. H.
Hope.

feater], in most instances, by an adroit movement of the
target. “My word, that fellow’s tough,” said Grime,
as he climbed out of the ring after another decision
had been added to his list. Tough the Manilaman
is, and he will beat more than will beat him.
Old Bill”: In the IT.S. to this day a writer com-
petent to relate how Griffo would stand at ring-
centre and, without striking a. blow, “make a monkey”
of the cleverest American lightweight of his time,
can find a market for the story; the Yanks read it
with avidity. ,T. J. Corbett revived the yarn
recently in the Saturday Evenihg Post. Yet in
Sydney on Saturday night we had the spectacle of
the cleverest Australian since the Rocks lad being
brutally hooted for doing the very same thing. In
the. 19th and 20 th rounds he repeated Griff o’s
choicest tricks, and the very class of people who used
to go crazy about Griff heaved insults at Grime.
Apparently Sydney boxing crowds have deteriorated,
and. are no longer capable of recognising real merit.
Or is it that Grime refuses to mix with the push and
keep it (and himself) drunk as long as his winner’s
end lasts ?
“Modestine”; Lindsay Robinson, feather-
weight champion of Maoriland, never lets pleasure
interfere with business, business in his case being
a dairy farm from which he delivers the milk in
an aged Ford.. Once when he was out on his
rounds he received a telegram from the president of
the Hastings Boxing Association: “Have you for-
gotten you fight here, on the 10th?” Lindsay sent
back a laconic “No.” Came another wire- “Chal-
lenger arrived here in state four days ago; when
can we expect you ?” “As soon as I’ve turned
the cows out,” Bobbie replied. He left Gisborne that
night, reached Hastings (150 miles away) at dawn,
licked his man the same evening, and was back on
his round next day.
* * *
Biting and kicking were barred when
Mike Yokel (12st. 91b.) “wrestled” Billy Meeske
(13st. 31b.) at Melbourne Stadium, but the com-
batants resorted to pretty well everything else.
There was more boxing than grappling in the fifth
round; Mike missed with three wicked chops,
but Billy connected with everything he let go. The
wily fellow from Wyoming avenged himself, how-
ever, in the next round. With a horrified air he pointed
at William’s trunks, and the latter glanced down,
wondering how he had fractured the conventions. Mike
pounced on him and gained a fall—the only one.
It is about the oldest trick in the business, but
Billy took hook, line and sinker. Alf Bridges’s
apparel (or lack of it) bore striking testimony to
the energetic nature of the contest. At the end he
had lost his shirt and a shoe, while his singlet was
torn, and a huge rent in his cream Oxfords was
caught together with a safety-pin thoughtfully
handed up by Val Quirk.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: The decision of J. O.
Anderson to turn professional has long been expected
by those who have followed his utterances as to
the expense attached to playing first-class tennis.
There -was a report some time ago that J.O.’s
services had been requisitioned by Pyle, the Ameri-
can promoter who induced Suzanne Lenglen and
Richards to become pros., and more may be heard
of that later. Anderson’s secession from "amateurism
is entirely his own business, but the public has
a right to demur to the nature of the “explanation”
he has thought it becoming to offer. He has turned
pro. he says, so that he can have more time “to
help, encourage and foster the talent which is,
without doubt, in some of our present-day younger
players.” Rats! J.O. is turning pro. because
i S sa^K ® e< j there is good money in the game.
.All luck to him, but he would do better to own, up
to it. He has announced, too, that he will not
become a paid performer till he has represented
A.S.W. as an amateur against Victoria. If he
beats the southern cracks it will be a splendid
advertisement for his professional debut presented
him on a lordly dish by the N. S. Wales L. T. A.,
which will pay his expenses into the bargain.

"Bramall Lane” : In a financial sense, the
contemporary English cricket pro. bats on a much
better wicket than his forerunner of 40 years or so
ago. In those days, a pro. might spend the winter
running an alehouse, or, if he hadn’t reached such
heights, working at his trade in Nottingham, Leeds
or Manchester. Now, if he is well in the cricket lime-
light, he dodges the fogs by going to India to coach
a team run by some bediamonded potentate. A
Recent cable dealing with casualties to Gilligan’s
M..C.G. XI, now touring India, told how the English
skipper had to “borrow” Dolphin, the Yorkshire pro.,
trom the Maharajah of Patiala. On another occasion
His Nibs “lent” Rhodes and Leyland, also of York-
shire, to serve as umpires. He must have a regular
string of Tykes in his stable.
“S h r ewsbury” :
There is nothing sur-
prising in the infor-
mation that the Maori
footballers in England
got sick of looking at
an Eton “wall game”
of football and left it
to watch a Rugby
match. “Wall” is
one of the weirdest

Boiled down, it con-
sists of two sets of
players shoving each
other along a wall,
contact with which
must be kept by the
men next it. One or
two stand outside the
“bully,” or scrum,
and kick for goal on
the rare occasions
when the ball comes
out of the tangle or
the wall. Goals are
the trunk of an elm
tree at one end of the
wall, and a little
postern door at the
other. A goal is kicked
about c-nce every five
years, though one
iconoclast is said tc
have achieved two in
one season.
Woodfull and Ponsford returned to club
cricket in Melbourne on Saturday and struck font'
straightway. For Carlton v. North Melbourne Wood-
lull made a chanceless 103 (out of 280 for 5 wickets)
in 160 minutes ; for St. Kilda v. Uni., Ponsford hit
up 132 in 175 minutes, the side losing 4 for 304.
Ponsford gaye a couple of, chances, but it was an
attractive innings. They are certainly a great pair.

“In-Shoot” : If anyone had told the aver-
age American ten years ago that baseball would
be soon beaten in popular esteem by a Britisher’s
game, the Yank would have advised medical atteiv
lion. If the prophet had added that the supplantev
would be golf, his auditor would have rung up
the Reception House. But the impossible has ha;
pened. The authorities controlling big-league base
ball have admitted it themselves in a recent pro
nunoiamento. The big following, and what is worse,
the big money, has gone over to the imported game.
1 tappers have deserted the local nine’s training
quarters, for the nearest links, tihe bellowing of the
l ooters is quelled in the sacred silence of the putting
green, and fc-lleslq blow of aill—the (cigarette
packets now show the portrait of Hagen or Bobbv
Jones, where Babe Ruth or Christy Mathewson once
beamed.

Split Second”lt is about time some-
thing was done t.o prevent the continual chronicling
ot new time “records,” in athletic sports at least.'
A regular offender is Australia’s effusive acquain-
tance, Arne Borg, v. no is announced weekly in the
cables as having put up a new swimming record in
some unheard-of place, with unspecified timekeepers
or under unstated conditions. Borg has broken most
of the swimming times since he was so soundly
beaten out here by Charlton. He has done it, accord-
mg to the watch, at places as far apart as Honolulu
and . Stockholm, and in waters of widely differino-
density and temperature. Every follower of racing,
knows liow worthless the time test is for a horse,
unless all the other conditions attaching to the trial
are taken into consideration. The same is true of
other speed contests, in which the importance of the
watch is being over-emphasised. World’s records
should only be admitted when they have been made
at Olympic or international meetings.
“ Exul ”: The Tas. Attorney-General
recently refused an application for an abrogation
of the State law that forbids the use of live pigeons
in shooting matches. Nevertheless, breeders of
pigeons find a market for them in Victoria, where
the public conscience is less sensitive. This is -i
matter which the Commonwealth Government mig!r
well take up. Our inherited sense of fair-play revolts
against a contest in which the cards are so heavily
stacked against one of the performers. And while
they are on the job members might turn their
attention to the kindred “sport” of coursing. Here
the victim has even less chance, for even if after
a clever run he eludes his pursuers, his success
leads only to his introduction to the field again and
again, until the dreaded jaws of his enemies close
on him at last. This form of amusement causes
suffering also to the pursuers, as the reports of
crippled dogs testify. The whole business is on a
par with the barbarous old English practice of
hanging a cat in a wicker cage and using it as
an archery target, though without the excuse that
then proficiency in archery was necessary for national
safety and cats were regarded as incarnations of
malignant spirits and agents of Old Nick
THE ONE THING NEEDFUL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The New South Wales selectors are keeping a
watchful eye on the visitors for country cricket week.
It is fondly hoped that country players of the calibre
of C. T. B. Turner, W. P. Howell and T. McKibbin
will be unearthed. Australia is sadly lacking bowlers.”
—S. M. Herald.
We’ve ( stacks of politicians and lawyers and phy-
sicians ;
Of tennis-ers and cueists the vintage seldom fails.
Few lands can show us betters in varied men of
letters
From near-omniscient David to artless “Smiler”
Hales.
We’ve artists (pace Stephens, A. G.) I’d back at
evens
For daubing paint on canvas against Augustus
John;
But in the ranks of bowlers—aye, groan and gnash
your molars—
We’ve quite a lot of decent geese but ne’er a
single swan.
Lord, bring them to Sydney
From townships far off,
Some chaps of the kidney
Of Turner and “Spoff.”
We ask it in humble
And suppliant tones:
A guile-loaded Trumble,
A rib-roasting Jones.
We have—all pressmen know it’s a fact—dead loads
of poets,
And some are grey in harness and some light-
hearted boys
Who challenge Rudyard Kipling in strains robust
and rippling,
Who wouldn’t take their hats off to Hardy or to
Noyes.
Golfers—that’s no delusion—we grow in fierce pro-
fusion,
Chaps who can dive like otters or swift as salmon
swim,
The bowler who can shatter stumps—that’s another
matter—
Our nascent nation’s crying need is such an one as
him.
From haunts of the cattle
Or gold-mining dumps,
Send someone to rattle
The Englishmen’s stumps.
Some head-using plotter
The Hobbses to foil,
Lord, send us a Cotter,
A Ferris, a Boyle.
We’ve quite top-notch pedestrians and rodeo eques-
trians ;
Our pugs are fair-to-middling, they tell me, and our
jocks.
But lost is Gregory’s cunning that once wrought
havoc' stunning,
And save for googlie-merchants the rest are mostly
crocks.
Selectors and committees comb all in vain the cities,
For men with pitch and spin and pace like those
of old we knew.
Pray Heav’n the bush shall bring them to swerve the
balls and swing them,
Or else there’s no predicting what the devil we
shall do.
How gaily we’d jib in,
Eschewing all growl,
Could we find a McKibbin
Or even a Howell.
Lord, send us to stiffen—
Before we despond—
Our Test teams, a Giffen
From back o’ beyond!

THE INKY WAY.
A proud little magazine is the Alfred, the
official organ of the Melbourne Alfred Hos-
pital, which this year, after two years’ toil
in the vineyard, is producing a special Christ-
mas number. The magazine was the idea ot
1). G. Macdougall, that competent pressman
who is the hospital's secretary; his fledg-
ling’s efforts have already added £6OO to tlie
hospital maintenance fund.
“Corio” : J. M. Walsh, the young Geelong
native who recently returned to Australia after
20 months’ residence in London, has placed
with various firms no less than 15 novels, one of
which has already gone into its third edition.
In spite of tlie coal strike and other adverse
influences, four of Walsh’s novels—-new
hooks, not reprints —were published m Lon-
don during September, which must be some-
thing like a world’s record Walsh is ot
mingled Irish and Scottish blood, and irom
both sides has come the impelling literary
force. One grandfather was a colleague ot
Duffy’s in the Young Ireland movement ot
the ’forties; the 1 other a poet ot local cele-
brity in the Lothiaus.
“Kelby” : The story of the appreciation of
a Bulletin cartoon by a Turkish officer
reminds me of the effect of another one on
the Yank. I was sharing a dug-out with a
chap whose brother, a well-known Liiglisli
writer, was touring America on an official
lecture tour arranged by the British 1 ropa-
ganda Department. The brother used to
send a monthly letter to the family report-
ing progress. On one occasion he wrote:
“I was getting on well in the State of -
till a copy of The Bulletin arrived. Ami
now I have to start all over again to try
and convince cousin Jonathan that we Brit-
ishers really love him. The cause of our
unpopularity is enclosed. The enclosuie
was a cartoon of Norman Lindsay s repre-
senting Uncle Sam as a miser grovelling on
the floor amidst a heap of dollars. Under-
neath the picture was, written : “What doth
it profit a nation ?”
The ordinary seven-and-sixpenny novel
contains from 75,000 to 80,000 words. The
Christmas Bulletin has 108 columns of
reading matter, apart from three full-page
drawings; and on the average there are 1200
words in a column. For sixpence Australia
can thus buy nearly two seven-and-sixpenny
volumes of Australian short stories, verse
and illustrations. And every line of it has
been paid for, and not a line of it lias been
printed before. Frankly, The Bulletin ns
rather proud of the performance, and prouder
that the size of Australia is beginning to
make such performances possible.
“X.N.Z.’’: A daily paper in the Speck
received, not many years ago, a cablegram
reading “Cardinal Merry del Val. lhc
sub., ill-versed in ecclesiastical subjects,
handed it over to the turf man ; the latter
glanced at “Ruff’s Guide” to see what im-
portant race was being run that day. In
the paper next morning appeared the amaz-
ing information from London: “The Liver-
pool Town Plate was run to-day, and
resulted: Cardinal, 1; Merry, 2; Del Val,
3.” What made it worse was that the oppo-
sition sheet had the correct rendering:
“Monsignor Merry del Val, a member of the
Papal household, has been created a Car-
dinal.”
“S.T.S.” : The printer again ! Alan Simp-
son, giving an address before the Geographi-
cal Society of South Aus., spoke casually of
Iceland as unfertile. The wretched machine
made it “Ireland,” and Simpson ran all the
way to the office to get a correction in ahead
of the “righteously indignant correspon-
dents” he foresaw. The man in the street
“can’t understand how such mistakes are
made.” But it isn’t hard. In these linotype
days you can’t alter a single letter; at the
least you must alter a line, and if the altera-
tion means dropping in a word or leaving
one out, it may mean re-setting two, three
or more lines. Probably the operator, to
begin with, made it “Iceland.’ But another,
who hadn’t read the context, made it “Ire-
land” while correcting another error in that
line. More than half the bloomers that get
into print are made in correcting other
bloomers that are prevented from getting
into print.
“Hamer”: The Chicago Tribune-Ocean
Times puts Canberra at a height of 22,000
feet, but what of that? Even the utterly
conscientious Manchester Guardian men-
tioned the capital which “Australia is build-
ing in the centre of the vast continent, hop-
ing that it will induce settlement in the direc-
tion of the desert heart of the country.” But
such eccentricities are scarcely surprising. 1
still retain pleasant memories of a novelist
whose heroine, newly arrived in Sydney, was
seated on the broad verandah of Petty s
Hotel enjoying the sweet warm scent that
blew in from the bush, and “the panorama of
the most beautiful harbor in the world,
when a magnificent specimen of humanity,
the neck of his red Crimean shirt open to
show his tanned chest, and the sleeves rolled
to the elbow, the dust on his boots and leg-
gings, made a dash to her side. Excuse me,
he said, as he flicked from under her feet a
snake that had coiled itself under her chair,
and with a powerful blow smashed the head
of the deadly reptile against a stone.
“C. Ghost” : That curious innovation _of
modern times, the free suburban daily, which
sustains life as a local advertising budget,
will be hit hardest if Lang’s latest proposal
ever becomes law; having no buyers it can t
pass on the extra ha’penny to them llie
Manly Daily was the first arrival of a
swarm which has settled in every Sydnoj
suburban area; but it is about the Newtown
daily that the best story exists. Syd Smith
was the founder; and the fact that Smiths
Weekly was just then spreading itself in
columns about its coming great daily was the
inspiration of his big idea. The Joynton
Smith crowd woke up one morning to find
that a small suburban printer had stolen
their thunder and that an. eight-page sub-
urban rag was spreading itself under the
title of Smith’s Daily. The terms of settle-
ment which resulted in the change of title
to the Newtown Daily were never disclosed.

GOOD fortune will not always come a man’s way ; but
any smoker may be lucky if he will. A GBD will
prove a winner every time, and the one to back con-
sistently is the new Silver-mounted GBD at 12/6. To dis-
tinguish it from the Standard range at 7/6, the pipe bears a
small GBD disc inlaid in the mouthpiece. The real point of
difference, however, in addition to the flush silver mount, lies
in the specially selected grains ; year by year fewer of them are
available. Ask your tobacconist to show you a few, and
convince yourself of the beauty of the briar.

A show that suddenly became popular:—
The intense interest in politics which marked the
N.S.W. crisis comes only once in a way; that of last
Monday has not been equalled in State politics this
century. The crowd which early thronged the gal-
leries had its overflow outside; it seemed that the
wnoie Trades Hall had marched to Macquarie-street.
Curiously early the news of what was going to
happen was known amongst the elect of those who
waited without, some of whom, as they drifted away,
spread the news: “It’s all right; Lang will win.”
Inside, a tenser feeling prevailed. Most of the on-
lookers here were women, and, plainly, working
women; and Lang was their Galahad. Although thus
made the hero, Lang, malignancy on a face whose
pallor showed more than usual the hard lines, looked
anything but the part. He gave the impression of
suffering from the wrathful feeling of a successfully-
defied tyrant, one who feels that if there was justice
in Heaven he should be able to send the rebels to
instant execution. Bavin was more in character as
the chief villain. Even before the way affairs had
been planned to go was generally known, there was
about him a sense of exultation—at any rate a
check had been given to Lang.
Loughlin had an almost carefree air, as a man
from whom tension has passed; he sat back easily,
whilst Goodin, looking like an amateur thrust into
the rOle of Atlas, floundered through an explanation
with a face that indicated a pitiful desire to remove
any possible impression that he had murder in his
soul. Gillies, shifting his spectacles about his face,
from near the point of his nose to his forehead, was
defiant. Both sides of the House seemed unhappy
and restless, the newest member, Tonge, giving the
appearance of frozen Misery; Cecil Murphy, who was
given the job of stonewalling whilst negotiations pro-
ceeded between the Government and the malcontents,
made Bavin’s gibes about playing marbles seem rea-
sonable ; he looked like a small boy who would dearly
love to throw stones, but was awed by an occasion
very* like a funeral. The House seemed easier when
towards the end the absence of the three rebels was
noticed ; but their abstinence from the division which
saved the Government evidently took some National-
ists by surprise. One of them was the harmlessly
irascible Theo Hill, the unconscious humorist of the
House. When the realisation came to him, on the
division, he looked as if his indignation might burst
him into a hundred of those crackers with which, in
his wrathful moments, he delights the House; but
whatever he said was lost in a tumult of cheering, a
loud buzz of conversation as the culminating moment
of the crisis passed.
* -!= * :!=
“Trilby” is to make its long-promised
reappearance at Sydney Criterion on Satur-
day night with Maurice Moscovitcli as
Svengali; “The Fake” has its final exposure
to-morrow night as a consequence. This will
he the last theatrical change until the
theatres produce their new goods for the
Christmas season. The Fullers, at the St.
James, will present their panto, a week
ahead of usual time, making a start on
December 18; in the shuffle of companies,
Elsie Prince is to come to Sydney as prin-
cipal boy, and Madge White goes to Mel-
bourne-—-“ Betty Lee” will bow a farewell
a fortnight from next Saturday. There will ‘
also be panto, at the Grand Opera House at
Christmas, by an arrangement between
J.C.W. and lessee Russell; meantime Ada
Reeves continues to keep that house bright
with “Spangles.” “Rose Marie” passed its
20Oth performance last week and might
establish a new record for length of run but
that “Tell Me More” is due at Her Majesty’s
at Christmas; at the Royal, “Abie’s Irish
Rose” is producing interest that would
satisfy a pawnbroker; and the Palace, not
always fortunate, is Yeekoning “Is Zat So?”
amongst its big winners.
Starting nearly half an hour after
schedule, “Little Mary” bumped and dragged
along through three acts in which the voice
of the prompter was often as clear as a bell.
Probably Saturday’s production was the
worst Sydney Repertory has been guilty of,
and confirms a long-felt suspicion that
Barrie is no meat for amateurs. Little Mary
is the seat of all emotions, and a clever old
Irish chemist has discovered that all the
boredom of the English upper ten is caused
by an overloaded stomach. He has devoted
his life to writing a large book of cures and
diets for overfed peers. This he bequeaths
to his grandchild, Moira Loney, and tells
her to he about the work he is too old to
accomplish. Acts ii and iii deal with
Moira’s adventures in the home of the Coun-
tess of Plumleigh, where she goes to save
but remains to marry. Pearl Appleton as
Moira Loney was delightful in looks and
movements; but her Irish accent, so perfect
in “Old English,” has become stressed and
broadened to the accepted stage brogue.
Gerald Carr, as the Earl of Carlton, gave
one of his best performances, but the Terence
Reilly of Gregan McMahon was not good
enough—for Gregan McMahon, Quite a
good bit of humor was conveyed by B. F. W.
Besemer’s Earl of Plumleigh. Upon the rest
the curtain is mercifully rung down.
Don Alfonso Zelaya, who denounces jazz
but plays some of it in a manner which
shows that all jazz is not bad, is the pre-
dominant noise at Sydney Tivoli; Steele
and Winslow, whose burlesque business
whilst performing really elegant dancing
tricks on roller skates, remains as refreshing
as ever, run a good second, with the well-
staged tight-wire act of Zoe Delpliine and co.
beaten merely by a short neck.
Heaton and lima Strange, prize winners
in a local dancing competition, are showing
Pullers’ Sydney audiences that even the
Charleston can be made graceful if done
well enough. About the British variety of
the dance there is, indeed, some beauty of
rhythm; the American variety becomes a
purely athletic endurance test. The dimi-
nutive Moon is as amusing as ever in the
“revue” part of the show; he has a remark-
ably even company at the back of him, and
calls his present menu “A Mixed Grill” —
which the advertisements in one Sydney
journal altered to “Girl.” But the new title
is quite all right for a show which has such
a varied assortment of female limbs.
The weekly search for the best picture:—
After all, Russia under the Czar had its uses, the
chief of which nowadays is the opportunity it pro-
vides for film stars to flirt with Grand Dukes. Con-
stance Talmadge, most delightful of screen comedi-
ennes, has a part to her liking in “Tile Duchess of
Buffalo,” shown in Sydney at the Hay market and
the Strand. An American dancer falls in love with
an officer of the Czar’s guard; but in a series of
cleverly designed scenes, she is compelled to flirt
with a Grand Duke in order to win her handsome
officer. The plot is closely knit, and Constance
Talmadge has to escape from many difficult and
delicate situations. In her light comedy she is
unexcelled on the screen, telling the story with the
most delicate touches of film art. Of course, the
whole thing is preposterous; but as a light and clever
fantastic comedy, it is one that will please the most
.sophisticated film patron.

Some Art for Mart’s sake: —
The Royal (Sydney) Art Society, which had its
harvest carnival in August, has come in again with
half a hundred pictures at a small exhibition in the
Fine Arts Gallery, King-street. It is a fair but not
inspiring show, good enough to catch the crumbs that
fall from the rich man’s table at Christmas. Delight-

ful freshness is in Lister Lister’s “Near Coalcliff,”
in which almost the mountain in the background
skips like a lamb. A mass of apple-bloom shows
gloriously in Mrs. Hedley Parsons’s “A Gippslancl
Farm,” and T. Friedensen gets into an attractive
“Morning” that greenery-yallery effect which usually
means thunder. Sydney Long’s two are rather tired.
James R. Jackson shows four with some very nice
effects; “Autumn Landscape, Tarana,” is most re-
freshing. His “Spit” (Sydney) doesn’t look like it.
Dora Toovey succeeds "better in dealing with the same
subject from a different point. It is difficult to see
the wood for trees in M. J. McNally’s “Spotted Gums
and Grey Box”; J. S. Watkins has a striking
“Vanishing Sydney” and three others, of which
“Youth” is rather clumsy. Trindall includes with
his “Nymphs in Arcady” a satyr with face so sneer-
ing that it is no wonder the lady tried to cover her
nakedness with the green top of a billiard-table;
W. A. Bowring has a good “Battersea Bridge,” but
his “Rose Gatherer” has a background looking more
like camellias than roses; and J. Salvana draws
some dispirited cattle in two paddocks. D. C. Reid’s
“Dealer’s Van,” resting in tjie purple of the evening,
makes a pleasant picture; and there are a dozen
or more others.

to this visitor the most attractive feature is the
success the artist has had with the colored pencil
without losing any of his values. “Shade” (No. 21)
is a specially good subject. The artist’s limitations
are shown in such pictures as one of the Argyle Cut,
where, in emphasising the massiveness of the side
walls and the overhanging bridge, an untrue sense of
narrowness is given to the road. The National Art
Gallery trustees have made three purchases, their
choice being biased by the historic interest of the
subject. One of them is the pencil drawing showing
the old S. M. Herald office, with the new' one
rising behind it; the others are “Scots’ Church,”
which is to vanish shortly, and “Old Homes, Mc-
Mahon’s Point,” both colored pencil sketches.
Still another Rebellion :
A rather stunning exhibition of Young Art in a
bellicose mood is shown at the Grosvenor Galleries,
where a company who designate themselves “A Modern
Group of Painters” have issued a general defiance to
those who are more anxious to be painters than modern.
Roi de Mestre, striking the idea of hybridising Oeci
dental and Oriental art, has produced several gro-
tesqueries, of which his picture of “Palm Beach” is
the most endurable. A lady squatting on a rug
has most certainly broken her legs. George Lambert
is amongst the group, with two small contributions ;
mindful of the high price of vegetables, he has
painted with skill an uninspiring picture of a cauli-
flower, one carrot (more cannot be afforded nowa-
days) and one egg. A moderately good “Spring-
time, Bathurst,” by Elioth Gruner, is included ; and
there are several of the patchwork productions of
Kenneth Macqueen. “The Mailbox”—the box itself
is hardly to be seen, but its smallness emphasises the
loneliness of the farmhouse included in the spreading
distance—is the best; “The Spur” looks like a
close-up of a dead grub. Besides these the confused
w«ter-eolors of John D. Moore, whose still-life in
Oils is one of the better things, looks good ; and Vida.
Lahey’s “Drying Sails” shows up well, although the
lady paints some flowers in a vase she bought cheap
as a misshape. Thea Proctor, best seen in her draw-
ing', is the other contributor; she tries no experi-
ments.
A reshuffle of the Firm’s shows in Mel-
bourne will find the Katja co. back in the
Royal on Saturday for a revival of “Wild-
flower.” Gus Bluett will again be Gabrielle,
and Marie Burke and other members of the
former cast will drop into their old places.
Renee Kelly and “Brown Sugar” will go
round the corner to the King’s, replacing
“Mary Rose” —the Barrie players leave that
day for their homeland. The same evening
Maud Fane will begin her farewell season
in Australia with the J.C.W. new English
musical comedy co., just back from Perth
and Adelaide. “A Night Out” will he the
beginning of the good-byes, in which there
will be ballets starring Thurza Rogers and
Robert Lascelles.
The response to the invitation to “Meet
the Wife” at the Athenaeum satisfies the
management, and the amusing lady, who was
the chorus-girl Millie of “The Best People.”
is worth meeting. The other relatives con-
tribute sunshine to a cheerful show. The
Princess Theatre plunges on Saturday into
pictures and pantomime. The film will be
“The Only Way,” Francis Scully’s panto,
kids supplying relief and variety in “The
Wedding of Baby Kerr.” The leading lady
of the juvenile show is six years old. Frank
Neil, at the Palace Theatre, finds the things
that happened to Jones still interest audi-
ences.

Santrey and his band having packed up
their traps, there are many new faces on
the Melbourne Tivoli stage. The Aerial
Smiths put on their acrobatic turn in a
most effective stage-setting, and they do it
well. Jean Barrios looks a perfect lady, but
his voice lets the illusion down occasionally.
Excellent pantomime is served up by Jerry
and co.; Herbert Browne and Rowena
Ronald stage a good comedy singing turn;
and Nellie Wallace is clever enough and
funny enough to get her laughs without
resorting to blue-edged jests. The usual pro-
portion of juggling and dancing and an
extra thrill from the Flying Winskills fill
up the evening.

This week at Melbourne Bijou, Jim Gerald

Spoil the Child.” Helene Chadwick and
Huntley Gordon unwind the supporting
“Golden Cocoon.” “Fig Leaves” is the
special picture of the week at Hoyt’s; manne-
quin parades in color are the big feature of
it. Zane Grey’s “Desert Gold” makes a
good contrast.

The roar of Wirths’ lions will not compete
with the strains of jazz at the Green Mill
after Saturday. Till then, however, the pro-
gramme will feature some clever animal
turns and acrobatic sensations.
Pianist Backliaus’s success at the Mel-
bourne Auditorium has encouraged E. J.
Gravestock to issue bills for further concerts
at the Playhouse this week, a Beethoven
programme being scheduled for to-night. On
Saturday night, in spite of heat and a drowsy
atmosphere, there was a full house. The
Beethoven Sonata in A flat —the one with
the soul-searing- Funeral March —was the
most wonderful offering. A group of Chopin
pieces and “Naila Waltz,” a Delibes-
Dohnanyi arrangement, gave light relief.

Adelaide Repertory Theatre has given two
renderings of “Marty,” by Alex. Symons, a
young Scotchman now living in South Aus.
It is a powerful and rather Stevensonian
three-acter, of a widow living quietly in
England as “Mrs. Smith,” till a revengeful
South American comes along and reveals
her as the widow of Daxter, a fiend who
got rich over there by exceeding the Congo
rubber atrocities off his own bat. He was
reputed to have killed 10,000 Indians, and
the scandal had been internationally notori-
ous. So now the girl engaged to the son
throws him over promptly—can’t stand “the
Daxter blood” in him. The poor wretch is about
to shoot himself when Marty, the rector’s
Sunday-school teaching daughter, comes out
of her shell and insists that he shall live
for his art, and with her as mate, if that
will help. All this is at midnight. There
is a third act by the cold light of morning,
with everybody suffering a reaction, and
about 10 minutes’ too much argument. There
remains one more secret, .and again only
Marty had guessed it. By a mixture of third
degree and cajoling, she forces the mother
to admit that the youth was the son of an-
other, and not Daxter. This leaves him able
to go back to the other girl; but Marty,
who has finally come down from her
“stained-glass window,” will not have it so.
A strong play, which with slight amendment
should do well on any stage.
* * * *
The acting of all the small cast was sound,
and in three cases fine. Beryl Kook lived
each one of tne various girls that Marty
has to be, and her great scene with the
stern, silent mother (Ethelwyn Robin) really
gripped the house ; also Jack Ham shone in
the difficult part of the foreigner. The rest
was just good amateur work, with Nellie
Boyd showing much promise in the small
part of the other-girl. Catherine Neill “pro-
duced ” with her usual effectiveness.

Point
“Bisley”: “Tarboy” (B. 18/11/’2G) is
wrong about First National’s intended Aus-
tralian production. It is not meant that
only one picture shall be done in Australia ;
a big international programme is to be
entered upon, but until the necessary studios
and laboratories are ready the pictures to
be produced in the near future must be sent
back to First National’s Burbank studios
for completion. The plans already in hand
call for 12 pictures to be “shot” in Europe,
Asia and Australia, definitely following the
policy of “greater consideration for the
nation’s local material in both artists and
writers.” Every artist in Australia will
get a chance on the “selection of type” sys-
tem ; and local writers will be given pre-
ference over all others. The productions will
be made from stories that deal with our
own history and traditions, as well as
selected fiction, with Australian backgrounds.
News comes of a merger of the old Pathe
co. and the P.D.G. (Producers’ Distributing
Corp.), of which that genius De Mille is
chief producer. Under the control of the
P.D.C. officials the new co. is to enter upon
an _ extensive production programme, and
again Australia is mentioned as the first to
receive consideration.
“A.G.M.” (Loud.) : Clara Butt and Ken-
nerley Rumford got a warm welcome home
at their Albert Hall concert on October 13,
when Ethel Osborne, the Australian soprano,
made her first appearance in London. The
debutante’s pure and delicate voice, fluent
vocalisation and correct tone easily won the
favor of the audience, which was hugely
delighted with her ready mastery of the high
D in the excerpt from “Lucia.” One critic
thought Miss Osborne was too free with her
encores. But London appearances are not
to be had every day; and it was not a bad
policy to sing a variety of numbers to show
her general equipment.
“Wigs”: Not only are the Williamson-
Taits building an “intimate” theatre and a
picture ditto in Melbourne, but they are
also providing Geelong and Brisbane with
new playhouses. There’s still a little money
made in the show biz evidently.
From T. R. Bavin, a trustee of Sydney
Repertory Theatre Society :
“Caul Boy” states (B. 11/11/'’26) that “many
sincere Repertorians” think the plan under which
the Sydney Repertory Theatre Society works has
turned out “darned badly.” As one of the trustees
of the society since its foundation, 1 am at a loss
to know what can have prompted such a statement.
The facts are that the agreement between the society
and Messrs. J. and N. Tait has -worked extremely well.
If your correspondent wants any further information
he can get it from myself or the other trustees, Prof.
MaeCallum, R. J. Hawkes or G. V. Portus. The
society’s work has given to thousands of patrons,
at very low cost, the opportunity of seeing a large
number of plays they would never otherwise have
seen; and Gregan McMahon’s work as director of the
society has been an outstanding feature in the artistic
life of Sydney for the last six years.
“Caul Boy”: Australians doing well in
Uncle Sam’s land include Irby Marshall,
who is supporting that ingratiating mummer,
George Arliss, in Galsworthy’s “Old Eng-
lish” ; Irby’s husband, Leonard Willey, and
Harry Plimmer, who is chief planet after
Ethel Barrymore in “The Twelve-pound
Look,” and Bob Grieg, whose 17st. has been
engaged by Schubert for another season.
“Whyte Lyon”: “Bisley” (B. 4/11/’26)
imputes Australia’s backwardness in film-
production to insufficient finance, but a con-
tributing cause is carlessness in producing.
In “The Moth of Moonbi” there is a mutila-
tion of Gordon’s lines, “With a running fire
of stockwhips and a fiery run of hoofs.” The
young hero, who in
the first few feet
of film arrives to
be jackcroo on the
station, is—lo
years later—still a
jackeroo on the
same place. In
the cool of the
summer’s evening
this young person
is taking his ease
on the verandah,
still wearing the
dusty breeches,
leggings and spurs
lie had worn all
day. While the
photography of the
Moonbi Ranges is
well managed, one
wishes the camera
had had better luck
with the drafting-
scene. The object
of cattle-drafting is
to select a beast
and run it clean
away from the
mob. The rider
depicted gets his
beast and scrim-
mages around the
edges of the mob
for a while, keep-
ing against the
bullock’s rump in-
stead of at its
shoulder; then he
apparently loses
the beast back into the mob again. It’s
fatally easy to pick holes, of course, but
one would like to see the Australian indus-
try flourish a little.
“Fane”: Adelaide is slipping. J. C.
Williamson’s and Hoyt’s are going to run
a new picture theatre in Adelaide. There
are already two picture houses in that
locality—on the south side of Rundle-street.
Nobody seems to be building another church.
“Stellsby”: If Moscovitch can equal the
hideousness of Reuben Fax’s Svengali,
played to the Trilby of Edith Crane (her
husband, Tyrone Power, was with her on
her second visit to Australia), he should be
worth seeing. In a London revival Tree’s
interpretation was tame compared with
Fax’s. It was worth two bob to merely hear
Reuben Fax Svengali’s maniacal laugh and
see him die. He was the creepiest character
that ever slunk across an Australian stage.
E. W. Morrison, who produced “Rain” for
the Ward-Fullers a couple of years ago, was
Australia’s first Gekko.
“Redlog” : Marie de Grey (B. 28/10/’26)
was, I think, the best we have had here,
Blanche Stammers and Mrs. Brough not
excepted. Her slight lisp made her not less
attractive. But why does “L.H.P.” omit to
mention in her repertoire “She Stoops to
Conquer” ? That was one of the most delight-
ful comedies ever produced in Australia.
“Goldilocks”: The Sorley company, whose
“rest” was recently mentioned by a contri-
butor as likely to strew more mummers on
the Point, isn’t resting. It made merely a
pause whilst passing through Sydney before
going to Newcastle, where its run, it is hoped,
will last until February; after that the
round of country show-dates starts again.
The man who gets a job with Sorley finds
it a constant one; the company, however,
has an annual holiday in Sydney at Easter
time, when the Show is on, and. as a conse-
quence, the country is unprofitable.
“Flaming Youth”: Australia is to see
again Judith (Frances) Anderson, the first
Australian to be given star honors in drama
in New York. She is on her way here with
the company which is to deliver “Cobra.”
The snake season will commence about
Christmas time, whether in Sydney or
Melbourne is not yet certain. Audiences
will be glad to welcome the actress who did
so well as leadinv lady with Julius Knight
and who has done better abroad.
“Hamfat”: Besides “Joseph of Canaan’
the Rev. George Walters wrote two other
plays. I never saw “Thou Fool!” but “The
Southern Cross” was produced by the
MacMahons at the Lyceum, Sydney, and
made a record of its own. It badly wanted
condensing—the players were still struggling
with the final scene when midnight came,
although the theatre had long since started
vo empty of people anxious to catch last
trams and ’buses. Though subsequently
slightly curtailed, it ran only for a week.
"R.K.D.N.”: “Tip-Toes,” the London
Winter Garden musical-comedy hit (B.
11/11/’26), is coming to Australia, with
bright little Josie Melville returning to her
native land in the part that gives the piece
its title. Josie is dead-tired of touring the
British “provinces.”
“Adelaide”: Synge’s “Playboy” had no in-
terruptions during the performance when the
Repertory Theatre of Adelaide played it some
10 years back. The protest was more prac-
tical. The hero was played, as it chanced, by
a young R.C. He had taken it as a piece
A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY.
COLUMBINE : “You’re incorrigible—you don’t even try to keep
straight!”
CLOWN : “How can I when Pm trying to make ends meet?”
of rollicking humor ; but next day he received
an intimation, private but powerful, of the
awful things that might happen to him if
ever he assisted again in such a travesty
of religion.
“Crojack” : Don Carlos Alfonso Zelaya, a
full-blooded Nicaraguan who has arrived in
(Sydney, has got the goods as a pianist, too.
He is a missionary against jazz. His method
of fighting this devil is to deliver a lecture on
music, with amusing interludes to coat the
pill, and then to play Strauss and Wagner
and Chopin and works by other classical com-
posers. Zelaya claims that his father was
president of Nicaragua for 19 years. He
himself was educated at Leipzig and West
Point Academy, L.S.A.
“Caesar’s Ghost”; Whenever I see an actor
who still manages to impress his artificial
personality upon the stage, I think of the
rebuke of an irate stage-manager who, after
trying vainly to get a mummer to put some
“guts” into his rendering of a rough part,
asked him what in Heaven he thought fie
was. “An actor and a gentleman, I hope,”
was the haughty reply. “That’s it! That’s
it!” yelled the exasperated s.-m. “You’re
always a gentleman when you’re an actor,
and an actor when you’re a gentleman.”
“Goldilocks”: Interesting to read a note
by “H. 5.8.” (B. 18/11/’26), referring to
Harry' Overton, although the reference is only
incidental. The useful all-rounder, finding
himself pushed out by importations, took to
chiropody as a side-line; and, at the time the
first Actors’ Union was formed (in 1902), he
had that to fall back upon in the gaps be-
tween theatrical engagements. The theatri-
cal managements jumped at the opportunity
to swear, when objecting to the registration
of the union, that they didn’t know Overton
as an actor but believed him to be a chiro-
podist. What became of him?
“Sturt”: May Beatty left Adelaide for
London last week after finishing her “Nan-
ette” season. It was in Adelaide she first
appeared, as a wee girl, with the Pollards.
“Runa”: In his reminiscences Cosmo
Hamilton mentions a young man who
haunted the New York theatres looking for
a part. He was tall and thin, and wore a
heavy fur coat, and “every day seemed
to get taller and paler.” Hamilton records
that he next met him on the screen as a
movie hero under the name of Rudolf
Valentino.
• _l.uu : “No, No, Nanette” has at last dis-
appeared from the London Palace after a
year and seven months’ run. Jack Waller
and Herbert Clayton have found a likeable
successor in “Princess Charming,” which is
from a Continental source. Alice Delysia,
W. H. Berry and George Grossmith have
the “fat”; and room has been found in the
cast for two of Waller’s “Butterflies” troupe,
well remembered in Australia, Wylie Watson
and Billy Rego.
“Lounge Lizard”: After 40 years’ enjoy-
ment of grand opera and classical and orches-
tral concerts in Sydney, I find it hard to be
reconciled to the tympani and drums. These
when played pp are endurable, and, in a
way, harmonious; but when thumped and
banged, the tone is ruined, and other in-
struments are drowned. Perfect balance of
tone in an orchestra cannot be achieved
while any instrument dominates another. At
last Conservatorium Orchestra’s concert
(10/11/’26), in Tschaikowsky’s beautiful No.
4 Symphony, there was such a fearful uproar
on the drums and tympani in the finale that
I couldn’t hear even the violins, though they
were working for all they were worth.
Beethoven did, I believe, elevate the drum
to a solo instrument in the lovely No. lfi
concerto, but there it is only tapped pp.
“ Caesar’s Ghost ”: Leslie Woods was
credited with the remark to a group of actors
near the proscenium during a rehearsal:
“Stand away from the obscenium there, yous,
and let’s get on with the play!” Leslie, who,
when he found any use at all for an h,
harnessed it to the wrong ’orse, carried with
him one fastidious player who was greatly
worried about his manager’s habit of murder-
ing the language. He devised a subtle revenge.
At each town a card was handed in by the
doorkeeper, with the message: “Mr. Leslie
Woods, —Mr. Lindley Murray would be glad
of an interview.” The joke was lost on
Woods, who had never heard of the celebrated
grammarian. The first card gave him great
satisfaction; subsequently the repetition of
the message without anyone appearing to
interview him got on his nerves. “There's
a silly cow named Lindley Murray been
follerin’ the show from town to town, send-
ing in ’is card, but never cornin’ ter light,”
he told the company one day.
“C.C.”: I am reminded by “Centurion”
(B. 4/11/’26) that the annual disturbance
at the Oxford Music Hall, London, on boat-
race night, when Jumbo, the 18-stone commis-
sionaire, used to give the university “bloods”
the final heave on to the pavement, was not
the only night in the ’eighties when youth
visited the halls for the pleasure of being
thrown out. The medical students from
“Bart.’s” had their special nights, and the
students from the Royal College of Veter-
inary Surgeons distributed their patronage
equally between the halls and the theatres.
A Vets.’ night was generally the most excit-
ing, as they had a playful custom of dangling
heads, legs and other portions of a gee-
gee’s anatomy on strings over the gallery
railing. Then, when one of the trophies
fell with a dull thud upon the bald heads
beneath, the chuckers-out would get busy.
They earned their pay, too, for a brawny
youth armed with the leg of a horse was not
too easily conducted outside.
“Hamfat”: Williamson’s stage manager,
George Kensington, proudly boasts that he
is the only actor ever associated with a once
notorious actor-manager who was paid in
full. He was lucky; the entrepreneur would
sooner spend £lOO in dodging payment than
pay £5O. Once his creditors cornered him
upon the stage, demanding instant payment
or they would tear him to rags. He sent
for the bag containing the heavy night’s tak-
ings, and commenced to count out. The situa-
tion so demoralised him that he threw him-
self on the honor of the angry creditors.
With a savage “How much is yours? Give
me a receipt!” he handed over the coin.
One of the mummers thrust himself into the
line of creditors. “How much is yours?”
demanded the actor-manager, looking up no
further than the extended hand. “Ten
quid !” said the actor; and he had pocketed
the money before the irate manager woke up
to the situation. Actually the mummer was
owed much more; but the manager ever
afterwards referred to him as “a scoundrel
and a swindler.”
WIRELESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1 was tempted to my sorrow, by persuasions that
were tireless,
To invest my hard-earned spondulix in putting up
a wireless.
“A crystal- set —eh, what?” I said; whereto replied
my daughter :
“Oh, dodge the crystal set as Satan dodges holy
water.
Old bean, you’ll find, believe me, that a five-valve,
with loud speaker,
Will give you all the stations from Big Smoke to
Tanganyika.
Now, be a sport, old dear.” “Orriglit,” I peeved;
“now go. I’m busy.”
And then I thought it over, speeding citywards, in
Lizzie.
Result? There could be only one result. I -went
and bought it,
And, just as if no trouble exer came to me, 1
sought it.
Behold me, then, upon the roof, involved with air-
and earth-line:
A job for steeplejacks, but not for fellows with my
girthline....
At last, a grimy wreck, and drilled with twinges of
rheumatics,
I found, when I had got her fixed, she gave me
nought but statics.
Oh yes, I got an expert in—l should at first have
done it—
He fiddled round a bit, then picked up 30K in
one hit....
And then we listened in; and this is what we got:
“John Pinches,
John P-I-N-C-H-E-S, height five feet seven inches”....
“Try 2HP.” We tried; and heard that margarine
was dropping,
But beans were rising, butter hard and spuds a
record cropping,
Though onions—-“ Switch to 4N8.” We switched,
and heard a lecture—
As much of it as we could stand—on Aztec archi-
tecture.
Then back to 30K. We learned the levels of the
Murray,
The Lachlan and the Snowy, which had fallen—l
should worry!
“We’ll try her later on.” Some jazz. We tried
again. Some fellow,
Who’d understudied pairing cats, was playing on a
’cello.
I’ve finished with the blinking thing. I gave it to
Aunt Minnie
For a setting of Rhode Island Reds, a Kodak and
£1 Is.

The Object of the Company
Is to replace the monopoly of the cumbersome, expensive
and out-of-date l’ari-mutuel system with the speedy and
mechanically perfect Totalisator.
Automatic Totalisators (France), Ltd., will purchase
from Automatic Totalisators, Ltd., their French patent
rights and the right to instal machines on the famous
Longchamp racecourse, which, with two other big
courses, is controlled by the Society for the Betterment
of French Racing. Among the honorary members of
this exclusive society are his Majesty our own King and
the Prince of Wales, with Viscount Harcourt as president
and Baron de Rothschild on the finance committee.
Consider the following points and then get the
prospectus.
(1) Automatic Totalisators, Ltd., guarantees all divi-
dends on the share issue of Automatic Totalisators
(France), Ltd., during the 20 years' currency of the
Longchamp agreement.
(2) This guaranteed dividend takes effect from the
date of the allotment of the shares.
(3) Wherever installed in France, and commencing
with Longchamp, the totalisator will have a monopoly
of betting, as there are no bookmakers.
(4) Totalisators in these circumstances must be wel-
comed by the French public, as under the pari-mutuel
system an army of accountants, running from booth to
booth, is necessary, and as long as 45 minutes elapses
after a race before the declaration of dividend.
(5) In addition to Longchamp there are eight othei
important racecourses in or near Paris.
(6) The Company will commence to earn profits when
its machines start to operate in the racing season next
year, and all future installations will be accomplished
without fresh capital.
(7) In addition to the guaranteed dividend of 10 per
cent, holders of preference shares will have the right to
participate in profits after the payment of 10 per cent,
on the ordinary shares.
As this is a Tax-Free Guaranteed Ten Per Cent. Investment, write or telephone to or call at the office of
Automatic Totalisators Limited

and a detailed copy of the Prospectus will be available.
Giuseppe Garibaldi, who has hurried to
France to stand by his brother Riocotti,
tvhose activities have threatened Franco-
Italian relations, was born in Melbourne,
and his mother was English. Giuseppe
served in the S’African war with the
imperial Light Horse, and later became an
American citizen. He lived in Italy for a
while, but Mussolini doesn’t like Garibaldis
around.
“Sturt”: South Aus., after the ideal sea-
son, has had two bursts of heat and some
lamaging gales. The wheat harvest, lately
talked of as a 14-bushel average, looks more
like being 13. But this is an average beaten
only three times in the last 12 seasons and
only once in the last five; and it means about
14 million bushels, or six million better than
last year.
“Brady’s Lookout”: “Wanchai” tells a
story of a French frigate putting into Mac-
luarie Harbor (Tas.) in 1803, shortly after
Bowen and Collins had settled on the Der-
went (B. 4/11/’26). Macquarie Harbor
wasn’t discovered till 1816, when Captain
Kelly, of Hobart, sailed into it. Kelly’s
Basin and Birch’s Inlet, in the harbor, were
names given by Kelly, Birch being the owner
of the ship.
“John Cow”: The false claim that Aus-
tralia possesses the longest railway on earth
is effectively disposed of by “Canar” (B.
18/11/’26), though his figure for the multi-
gauge hardware between Dajarra (Q.) and
Meekatharra (W.A.) is in excess of that
given by the Victorian Railways Magazine,
which makes it 5433 miles. The Trans-
Siberian line from Leningrad to Vladivostok
is 5481 miles—all one gauge.
_ C. Hogarth, the new president of the
S’African Soldiers’ Association in Tasmania,
has been in a few scraps in his day. He
served in the Burma campaign, was at the
relief of Chitral, and smote the Paynims hip
and thigh in the Punjab, the Frontier and
Tirak. In S’Africa he was in besieged Lady-
smith, he fought in China during the
Boxer rising, and did his bit in the Biggest
Scrap. He won his first medal at 15.
“Wingella”: Where does “Bris” (B.
5/8/’26) get the idea that Lord Stonehaven
has no accent? I sat next to an old Perth-
shire Scot when Lord Stonehaven was being
welcomed to Darwin, and at the very first
word the G.-G. spoke I turned and looked at
my neighbor. He laughed back at me, and
then leant back in his seat, content. Neither
of us needed any further evidence of the
speaker’s nationality.
J. H. Woodhill, who died at Waverley
(Sydney) the other day after 77 years spent
in Australasia, became an Australian by
accident. He was ship’s boy on the John
Gardiner when that windjammer arrived at
Williamstown. AVliile the master hunted up
a cargo the crew tried its luck on the gold-
fields. The boy, dawdling back to port,
arrived in time to see his ship making its
way down the bay. He followed the lure
of gold to Maoriland, and did well, after-
wards going into business.
C. J. French comes from Cape Town,
where he was University lecturer on the
locally important question of venomous
insects and reptiles, to be curator of the
new Snake Park in Adelaide. He is an
expert handler of snakes, and has brought
sundry African horrors with him, and the
other continents are all to be well repre-
sented. Adelaide City Council has granted,
and the ratepayers have ratified, the neces-
sary lease of a small slice of the park lands
to Keith Minchin, whose idea it is. He
believes it to be the only snake-park in
Australia, and promises a free supply of
snake-venom to any laboratory studying the
scientific production of antidotes.
A sort of link with Captain Cook was
severed recently when Mrs. Richard Vincent
died at Westerham, Kent (Eng.), aged 94.
She was the daughter of Captain Ranulf
Dacre, who traded to Maoriland in the
’thirties. In 1833, when she was in her first
year, the old Maori chief Patuone, who saw
Captain Cook’s ship the Endeavour at Cape
Brett in 1769, used to visit Captain Dacre’s
vessel. Patuone often picked up baby Dacre
and fondled her, but one day she grabbed at
the old warrior’s head (which was strictly
tapu), and thereby incurred the displeasure
of its owner, who afterwards avoided the
sacrilegious youngster. Patuone died in
1872, reputedly over 100.
More picture-shows in Melbourne:—
At the Decoration New Galleries last week Miss
M. G. Finley, who exhibited only oils, showed work
that was energetic rather than graceful. Her flower
studies had promise, but her landscapes were hard
and lacked atmosphere. Miss I. F. Knox, who is
a water-colorist, showed fewer pictures than her
friend, but her offerings were more appealing. “Sun-
set, St. Kilda,” was about the best of her sub-
jects, and “Windy Day, Hampton,” deserves mention.
Dora Wilson, who used to do people and flowers in
pastels, has discovered that there are pictures lurk-
ing in every comer of a city, and she has exploited
her discovery in a series of canvases that show
bits of Melbourne in spring, summer and winter.
There is plenty of life and color in these essays,
and the drawing is eommendably accurate. ■ J.
Collins’s landscapes offer a foil to the crisp, gay
work of his co-exhibitor. He favors rather sombre
effects, and his work, though palpably immature,
holds promise. Two small sketches, “Quiet Morn-
ing, Geelong,” and “The Steps, Parliament House,”
call for appreciation, and gums are well handled in
a couple of big canvases. The new-comer promises to
develop a fine decorative sense.
“Goldilocks”: The long-eared Australian
public still likes its musicians’ names written
in a foreign language. A classic example of
the preference before the war was when Fred
Haines, one of the best band-conductors
now in Australia, for 15 years with the
finest of Britain’s military bands and recog-
nised as a capable adjudicator, decided to
make Australia his home. He found it so hard
to get a job, in spite of his qualifications,
that he cynically tested a theory that a
German name went further in music than
all other qualifications, and applied for
a bandmaster’s job as Fritz Heintz. The
job wms his; but almost immediately the war
broke out and Germans were pushed off the
musical map, including the rabidly British
“Herr Heintz.” The latest example was an
opera venture at the Sydney Hippodrome.
With English principals in the title-rfiles,
the takings were £25 ; bnt when some Dago
names were put into the programme the
night’s takings went up to £l3O.
More than GOOO stories and poems and
over 5000 drawings reach The Bulletin
annually. They come from every corner of
the Commonwealth, Maoriland, New Guinea,
Fiji and the other islands that dot the
Pacific. Every overseas mail brings contri-
butions —from a diplomatic office in Spain;
from a farmer in Paraguay; from an artist
in Paris; from a journalist at Toronto,
Canada ; from a musical critic at Manchester ;
from an Inland Mission station in China;
from a bank in Constantinople. The list of
Australian contributors runs far into four
figures, and embraces almost every walk of
life, from Judges up or down to fruit-hawkers.
The best of the stories and verse is preserved
for the Christmas number, and the result
for 1926 will be on sale at all newsagents
and bookstalls on December 11. The Bul-
letin doesn’t mind saying that it is a good
sixpenn’orth.
“Hamfat”: A star in the minor mana-
gerial firmament dropped out a while
ago with his views about the morals of
stage ladies rearranged. With money left
when his father died, he plunged into
theatrical management. It soon became
evident that his idea had been that the
women of the co. would be a sort of private
travelling harem. His overtures led to tne
prompt departure, one after another, of the
women. When they were all replaced lie
became more cautious; and then he actually
did find an actress who was amiably disposed
toward an illicit partnership. The other
women promptly decided to treat her as if
she did not exist; and the disillusioned satyr
found himself whirled into matrimony with
a woman with a dark past and a purpling
present. It is bad enough for one who has
put the world on moral stilts to face his
disillusionment; the disillusionment of one
who finds morals less loose than he thought
they were must be even more bitter.
The latest little fuss in Russia was a misty
affair, as all fusses in that dark land are,
but it ended with Trotsky and his party back-
ing down to save their heads. Apparently
they had a desire to go back to some pretence
of popular government, while the men now
in power have outgrown that and simply
appoint each other and select their
subordinates. The land seems to become more
secretive as time goes on. There is no news
about the expiration or dissolution of Parlia-
ment, the election of a new Parliament and
a new President, or the downfall of the
Cabinet. Of speeches in Parliament, if there is
one, or of orations by Ministers stumping the
country nothing is heard. In England, France,
Belgium, the U.S. or Australia these events
are public property, but Russian internal
politics go on a muffled and catlike way,
without even the noise expected from a
healthy cat.
“Norbrite”: One of Mussolini’s subjects,
now resident in Victoria, has made applica-
tion to the Railway Department for a saw-
mill site in this courtly manner:—
I have the intention to purchase some wood at the
forest, and I demand at this respectable office to have
the permit to let a piece of land at the terminus
of that new branch of railway to settle the saw.
I beg your pardon, with every respect and con-
sideration,
“Finn” : Above what age is an immigrant
immune from dropping into our method of
speech? I once taught three small boys from
Belfast. Two of them, aged seven and eight,
had attended school in Ireland. Their pro-
nunciation, accent and language put them
in a class of their own. The young Aussies
used to enjoy hearing them tell a story: “The
wee dunkey nigh drunk the bar’l of wotter.”
In two years’ time the eldest boy had put
aside his distinctive accent —it cropped up
only in moments of great agitation—the sec-
ond boy had quite lost it, and the third had a
decided Australian accent. Their parents,
folk in the early thirties, still kept a very
strong, burry brogue. One day the father
remarked to me that when they had been six
months in Australia he couldn’t understand
his own children.

“HOW TO SHOOT.” Practical Hints
with illustra-
tions and diagrams by Robert Churchill. The
author of this book is one of the leading gunmakers
in London, who all his life has had a practical
experience of guns and shooting; he writes as
though he were giving instruction at his own Shoot-
ing School. And probably there is no one better
qualified to give instruction as to how to handle a
gun. This book should be read by everyone who
cherishes the ambition of becoming a “good shot.”

R.C.: You go very close; but little
awkwardness always spoil your verses.... Kevin M.:
Not up, though promising. .. .C.R.M.: “Lost in the
wild-eyed symptoms of the night” baffles us....
D. : “Gone—forsworn” is a valiant effort at
rhyming. .. .Prat: Verse walks on stilts and comes a
cropper... .C.E.J.: Vivid horror; but not a story.
....Car. L.: Man is born to sorrow as the sparks
fly upward; but, after all, there is something in
having been a spark.... H.J.V.; For one thing, at
that long-ago time the Salv’army Home did not exist.
. ...J.H. (Melb.) : Your characters “piped,” “shot,”
“perked,” “purled,” “pinged,” “granted” and
“volleyed” things instead of simply saying them.
. ...E.S.: Fair first attempt, but the thought is
crude. .. .D.O’K.: “When released one moment from
the cold exigencies of the daily round” is a wonder-
ful line of verse... . R.G.Y.A.: Not quite.... Disley :
No new matter or thought. .. .Akran: “Rum” fair
idea, handling bad... .A.J.P.: Well enough done, but
done again and again.... J. Grantley L.: Too -ylong.
. ...O.W.: “Changing Bush” wants more cultivating.
.... Meridian: Good yarn buried in words....
H.M.W.: Not very interesting... .T.S.B.: This gives
a new picture of a bush sunset:—
Look ! See ! The sun sinks in the west;
Hark! Young birds chirp within the nest;
See, here, the stockmen spurring home;
Hark! Hear the shearers’ gramophone.
But we had to cut our ears off before that rhyme
was passed in....M.C.: A melodramatic circum-
stance. .. .E.R.M.: Dull, prosaic conclusions....
C.H.: Not suitable... .Sally: Not in our alley....
T.O.L.: Wrong. There is more joy in the editor’s
heart over one screed that contenteth than over the
99 that need an answer in this column... .W.G.B.:
You seem to have a natural gift, although the
verse fails through meaningless phrases. Mend these
and submit again... .M.L.C.: Too slight... .Ross D.:
Far too long. And too many dates in a story spoil
the pudding... .Ripponlea: Your free medical advice
is given a chance:—
Scorn expensive potions like lysol. to drink,
Which tickles th’ tonsils as you blow and blink.
Try one which pleasantly placates all pleural ills,
Called paregoric and syrup of squills.
Olive oil and rum is lauded by some
But to me the oil spoils th’ taste o’ th’ rum;
And to take rum alone isn’t much good,
For it’s making a medicine out of a food;
And procrastination with each paroxysm and spasm
May send you afloat o’er Eternity’s chasm.
.... J.R.C.: Dream stories run under a big handicap;
you increase it by squeezing your lines of copy
into a solid mass... .A.T.L.: The rose-tree story is
blooming tiresome... .Learn: Too much padding....
Beta: False, feeble... .Prot: Verse that needs so
many explanatory annotations condemns itself....
E. : Started a good flight; the last verse was a
forced landing... .Col. H.: Sent a copy to the King,
eh? God save the King !... .R.E.B.: Command to
your head to “reel round and onward sweep” has
its humor. Unfortunately you don’t mean to be
humorous.... K,A.: Finishes lamely.... Koonek:
“Call of Duty”" is sounded on a dull instrument....
Genu: We’ve read that weird affair three times
in two weeks, and can’t see any improvement....
Leti M.: The telling is dreadfully dull.... Mavis P.:
You have an instinct for dramatic stories, but the
telling is crude. Polish “Happiness” and re-submit
it....M.H.: Merely a natural history note cut in
stove lengths... .T.M.S.: Make the rest as good as
the last stanza and you’re a winner. .. .A.J.D.: Can’t
feel any sympathy for the man who made a mess
of himself and everybody because a girl proved
false-hearted... .R.W.K.: They fail... .W.E.C.: Idea
good; but your hand is too heavy.... T.S.B.: A
newspaper par. in cheap limerick form B.W.:
We’ve settled the “Doubt”... .W.D.H.: The final
bump bounced it into the w.p.b R.P.: They are
little wing-flappings rather than flight.... John P.:
The one bright gleam was the reference to the
religious father who saved his kids’ Sunday whippings
for Monday morning. .. .S.R.T.: You leave the yarn
in the air... .M.L.F.: Not suitable; might do else-
where... .J.A.K.: It’s a new incident, worth a par.
A.McM.: Slovenly... .Pat: The animal is allowed a
couple of bounds: —-
A notable figure in national regalia
Is the far-famed ’Roo, whose home is Australia.
Most famous of all our bush-bred marsupials,
And prominent, too, ’mong all our quadrupials.
Go on, then, oh ’Roo, in this thy great speed,
Australians all give thee thy well-earned meed
Of praise for thy pluck. Good luck to you, Rooev,
We’ll hail thee all round with the national coo-ee.
F.G.H.; They nearly got there... .Clytie C.:
The religious editor grew so excited reading about
those embraces that he kissed the charlady....
I.A.S.: “His great ambition was to be an author,
but he had been trained to be an electrical engineer. ’
Some authors we know have been trained to be plumbers
or navvies. In fact, the worst authors we know
are those who have been apprenticed to the trade.
... .W.L.F.; There’s none of the sharpness of a
serpent’s tooth in “Gratitude”... .R.B.: Your hero’s
punch is dry ; we’d rather have his whisky.... J.M.L.:
“Nothing New” is nothing new. Moreover, it’s only
prose badly cut into verse-lengths N.H.O.: If
that’s a sample, please don’t “think of some more.”
.... W.F. J.B.; You may yet succeed; one who can
rhyme “lends a” with “influenza” may do anything....
W.T.P.; Your shy novelist is dreadfully unreal....
S.M.C.: Garbage only... .Sally M.: Even Lang hardly
deserves that sort of verse. ... A.L.G.: Rhyming
“kindness” with “fineness” is magnificent, but it is
not verse.... Bed P.: Tricked him into signing the
pledge, did you? Callous brute! F.L.D.; Tauten
it up and make a real story of it.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
G.E.T.: Mechanical man and woman staring fixedly
at nothing in particular. .. .R.W.E.: Not giving the
glad eye to the plump undressed prize pullet....
R.M.: There is not a giggle in the joke nor merit
in the sketch... .W.D.: Neither good enough....
C.D.T.: They hover between a likeness to a barbed-
wire entanglement and an unpruned fruit-tree in
winter. .. .A.F.: The negro porter makes us suspect
its originality... .N.E.N.: Knife polish joke is rusty.
. ...P.C.: But England is not in the centre of the
Indian Ocean.... K.C.D.: The modest niece must
blush unseen... .P.M.D.: Your malodorous dictator
would give a morgue-keeper a nightmare... .Geioora:
The sceptical enterpreneur is an anatomical curiosity.
. ...F.H.: Send the 200 in one batch and let us get
the agony over... .T.H.: You are still bogged....
W.M.: You too. ...C.R.: Beneath your swirling lines
there is promise... .A.M.K.: Kitchen utensils hover
’twixt ceiling and floor. .. .E.G.: Looks like either a
collaboration or an imitation.

The New Method of Shaving
NO BRUSH, NO SOAP.
ã
Is it not strange that for hundreds of years man has been
scrubbing his face with soaps full of soda, and has nevei reasoned
that under such treatment the skin must suffer? Nothin;.; is more
ugly than a face that looks raw. Shaving soaps are always
the same old method of shaving. They are made with soda.
But now we have discovered the natural method, where no
brush and soaps full of soda are needed. Shavex is a skin lood.
One can shave in half the time, and you will get a smoother and
closer shave than you have ever had, and shaving will become a
pleasure instead of a torture. Your skin will look and feel like
satin, and your face under this treatment will look twice as young.
No after lotions are required when using
SHAVEX
Large tube, 1/9; larger tub e (double quantity), 2/6.
MR. LESLIE HENSON, the famous
actor, writes“l use ‘Shavex’ every time i
shave, and think it is the quickest, cleanest
and most delightful preparation ever invented
for shaving,.”

AMBER
IS ALWAYS IN FASHION
INGE time immemorial Amber
has been favoured by Royalty*
No Queen of the East was
adorned without it. The Greeks and
Romans believed Amber to be magic-
al. The Ghinese held it to be the
one stone worthy of being coloured
with the Blood of the Sacred Dragon.
For centuries all nations have con-
sidered that the wearing of Amber
brought good fortune and its magnetic
properties warded off illness.
This is very fashionable for Ladies’ Necklet wear, and

“Elsinore”: Whaling is the latest trade
offering in Hobart. An SOS was broad-
casted from 7ZL on Saturday evening for
men for the Norwegian factory ship Melson
Alonso. Over 50 men and youths applied.
One young man was so eager for an engage-
ment that he walked most of the 70 miles
that separated him from Hobart.
* * * *
“Uramao” : Adverse criticism of the Nor-
wegian whalers’ expedition to the Ross Sea
takes no account of the amount the expedi-
tion leaves in Maoriland. Last season 4000
tons of Westport coal were consigned to the
fleet at Paterson’s Inlet, and the chasers at
Port Chalmers needed £12,000 worth of
repairs. And they tackle, too. a job which
we have very carefully left alone.
* * * *
“Sturt”: South Aus. is looking forward
to a 40-million-bushel wheat harvest —which
should bring in 11 millions sterling. The
Government Statist gives an official forecast
of a 14-bushel average, total 37 millions,
but admits expecting this to be exceeded.
The record harvest was 451 millions in
1916-17. Barley is extra, and a steadily-
increasing item. The S.A. exhibit (from
Yorke’s Peninsula) has just taken all sorts
of honors in the Brewers’ Exhibition in
London.
* * * *
“Tee”: Melbourne’s numerous butchers
and meat cos. who buy at Newmarket got a
shock a few days ago—an intimation that
all stock-agents had agreed to cut out the
discount (lid. in every £) which has for
years been allowed on prompt settlements.
Rates of wages and expenses have gone up
without any corresponding rise in commis-
sion ; so the agents consider they are
entitled to discontinue their weekly “gift.”
What some of the butchers have to say about
it won’t bear print, though if they can’t
make somebody else pay for it they won’t
run true to form.
“Modestine”: Manuka, or ti-tree, is the
ugly-duckling in timber which has replaced
the primitive forests of Maoriland. It now
looks as if the straggly, rough-barked shrub
may prove to be a swan. An Auckland firm
has found that the tough, dense-grained
wood makes excellent knife-handles, door-
knobs, etc. This enterprising firm imported
steel from Sheffield, forged it into knives of
every variety, but mostly those used in the
butchering business, and equipped them with
“Whash time, ole chap?”
“I never wear a watch with evening-dress.”
“Thash right. I shpose you can't have ’em
BOTH out at shame time.”
manuka handles, producing a stout, trust-
worthy-looking article which is selling freely.
As manuka grows to a height of 20ft. or so
in the far North and attains quite a respect-
able girth, there will probably be other
avenues of usefulness for a wood which has
hitherto been valued by the cook only for
its heating qualities.
* * * *
“Sixenate": The High Court has just
shown that a hole may sometimes be knocked
in the “contributory negligence” plea which
has blocked the claims of a multitude of
injured workmen for compensation. In the
case at issue the plaintiff at knock-off time
put his foot on a machine whilst he un-
fastened his working shoes; and, the machine
moving, his foot was injured. The Full
Court of N.S.W., declaring that contributory
negligence had been shown, upset the verdict
of_a jury which had awarded the plaintiff
£350 damages; that decision has now been
reversed by the High Court. This Court
said, in effect, that if a machine was left
in such a condition that it was likely to
cause injury it did not matter a tinker’s
c rse if contributory negligence on the part
of the injured man helped towards the acci-
dent. A small army of men who have been
beaten for damages by the old defence will
wish that this point had been made clearer
long ago.
* * * *
“Crojack”: The steady increase of foreign
motor-ship tonnage in our overseas trade
should make Australians think. Two new
vessels are being built by the Dutch Royal
Mail Line, to replace the Houtman and
Tasman in the .Java run. They will have
refrigerated _ space and plenty of passenger
accommodation. The Norwegians have a
good hold on the wool trade to the Conti-
nent. The Blue Funnel and C. and D. lines
are building fast motor-ships to compete,
though, so far, the C. and D. motor-ships
have been used only in the M.L. trade, hi
which no foreign lines have been able’ to
get a footing. Still, the co. has some fast
steamers carrying Australian produce to
British markets. It is scarcely two years
since the Aorangi was acclaimed as a wonder,
being the first large passenger motor-ship’
but dozens have been built since then. One
big advantage of this type of vessel is that
it burns crude petroleum, on which no duty
is payable in Australian waters, whereas the
oil-burner uses residual oil, and has to pay
duty on all it burns on the Australian coast.

ALWAYS SAFE IN A
BIG BLOW
No matter how stiff the wind is the “Billabong” is safe. The
Automatic Governor and Speed Regulator presses the brake
on the windwheel and slows it down to a safe pumping speed.
When a gale blows up the Regulator throws the wheel out of
the wind, and does not bring it back till it is safe to do so.
OIL ONCE EVERY SIX
MONTHS
The new enclosed gear “Billabong” has double
massive gears working in an enclosed gear-box.
Partially fill this gear-box with oil every six
months; that is all the attention it wants.
These two points make the “Billabong” a favorite
on big stations and runs where the mills are far
apart. No worry about damage by storms—or time
lost in oiling. We still manufacture the old-type
“Billabong.” Many users found it so satisfactory
that they still order and recommend it. Write
for pamphlet. The mill for your place.

CANADA —that wonderland teeming with
romance and adventure —opens unknown
beauties to those who would escape from the
hustle and bustle of life in a crowded city.
The glories, splendour and majesty of the Canadian
Rockies form an effective background for the shining
lakes and other beauty spots that lie at their feet and
far away from all the worries and cares you can rest for
awhile in a cosy, jolly bungalow camp or in a luxuri-
ous hotel.
The Canadian Pacific Railway
system of transportation is the most up-to-date and modern
railway system in the world. The equipment is designed for
the greatest comfort, while the service of all employees is
unequalled.
Plan ahead—book your accommodation for traips, hotels and steam-
ships prior to your departure. Through tickets to England and the

Allen Anderson, one of the heads of the
Orient Line, now on the way to. Sydney m
the Oronsay, will be interested in the pro-
posal to run a line of 24,U00-ton ships to
make the passage from London to Sydney
in 28 days, the promoters of which are now
angling for an Imperial subsidy. The three
big Orient ships, Otranto, Oronsay and
Orama, could make the trip in four weeks if
their stays at Australian ports were cut down
and sufficient monetary inducement offered.
“Coorparoo” : Doing duty now as a C9al-
liulk on the Brisbane River, the one-time
spick-and-span yacht Lucinda is scarcely
recognisable beneath her coat of grime.
Built in 1884 for the Queensland Govern-
ment, she carried many State Governors up
and down, and much political history was
made in her. The late Sam Griffith and
his colleagues once drafted a Commonwealth
Constitution in the saloon, and Queensland
Cabinet Ministers developed a habit of trans-
acting State business on the steamer while
she cruised about the Brisbane River.
“AdeL” : Between the mouth of the Albert
and Macarthur rivers, not mentioning other
equally great stretches of the Northern coast,
are a series of shallow salt-pans with innum-
erable little creeks and salt-arms which wind
aimlessly in and out in all directions; these
are annually filled by the sea during the
king tides of November. When the winter
months come they dry rapidly, and from early
August till the coming of the seasonable
storms in October, all these pans are dry
and bear thick crusts, in some instances
feet deep, of fine to coarse white salt. Aus-
tralia may not require the salt itself, but it
contains over 30 known kinds of chemicals
and drugs, many of which we import, while
the others are of great importance commer-
cially. The huge deposits in the smaller
arms are inferior to those of the pans, being
of a dirty rust color (caused, perhaps, by
decaying leaves from the broom ti-tree which
fringes these channels), but the salt is no
less rich in chemical contents.
From Ralph Falkiner, the inventor of the
sugar-cane cutting-machine (B. 7/10/’26) :
I would like to point out that I have never claimed
that this machine was the first thing of its sort.
What I do claim is that this is the first machine
to my knowledge that has successfully cut and
topped straight, standing burnt cane. lam very
pleased to be able to add that by a very simple
attachment to the machine I have successfully illus-
trated that it is possible to machine-harvest yreen
cane, and it is hoped to do this commercially in
the near future. The great value of being able to
harvest green cane without burning off the. trash
is well known to the industry, and is of prifne
importance. Cane is only burnt to save labor. Two
machines have been demonstrating lately in Queens-
land, but unfortunately one of them was burnt on
the railway truck between Ingham and Cardwell.
The other machine is now working at Babinda. A
few minor troubles have been met with, which is
only to be expected in the early stages of such a
revolutionary appliance, but this does not affect the
principle, which is proved correct and efficient.
The N.S.W. measure for the compulsory
registration of land-agents is the dud which
might have been expected. It applies only
to “those persons dealing with lands under
the Crown Lands Acts, Closer Settlement
Acts, Returned Soldiers’ Settlement Act,
Western Lands Acts, and any other Acts
the administration of which is vested in the
Minister of Lands.” That doesn’t include
the sharks who take deposits from silly men
and women on allotments located on the
bridle-track which leads to the gum-tree at
the end of it, giving assurances that there
is a water frontage, a railway under con-
struction and an eight-storey hotel going
up with such violent leaps that it is off the
ground half the time. It is probable that
very few of these unpleasant allotment-
dealing creatures do Crown Lands business,
but if they want to take it on it should be
easy to have a registered minor shark in the
office. Or they may get a tame solicitor
in a scanty way of practice to occupy a
room on or next door to the premises. Soli-
citors, for some reason or other, don’t require
to be registered under the Act.
F. C. Benliam, of Sydney Uni., has been
telling the Arbitration Court that the wealth
of Australia per head is less than it was 30
years ago. But what else could you expect?
Apart from the general slowing down, in the
30 years between 1891 and 1921 the propor-
tion of wage-earners in Australia devoted to
primary production fell from 30.7 per cent,
to 25.1 per cent; the proportion engaged in
manufacturing industries rose in the period
from 30.7 p.c. to 31.2 p.c. (which is only
\ p.c.), and the proportion of all other bread-
winners (wholesalers and retailers, money-
lenders, civil servants, doctors, lawyers, but-
lers and parsons) rose from 38.6 to 43.7
p.c. In Maoriland, in the same 30 years, the
bread-winners engaged in primary production
fell from 35.8 to 27.7 p.c. The industrial
army shrank from 27.9 to 26.5 p.c., and the
non-producers, who used to be 36.3 of the
crowd, increased to 45.8 p.c. Meantime,
the foreign debt has been growing at a pace
that enormously out-distances the growth of
population. The labor-union boss is not all
to blame either. The floods of loose talk about
our great natural resources and so on have
merely encouraged people to think they could
afford to loaf and take liberties of all sorts.
“Spare Corporal”: The war gave the final
knock to the old superstition that it was
impossible to breed tough youngsters in “the
tropics.” Amongst the Diggers “.Comes from
Queensland” was regarded as sufficient to
explain that the man spoken about was big
and hefty. Dr. St. Vincent Welch, medical
officer of the Queensland Department of
Public Instruction, who has been making
a health survey, puts the children of the
northern part of the State ahead of all
others. Plenty of exercise, Welch says, is
all that is necessary to make the residents
of the hot North a virile people. It was
the absence of exercise owing to the cheap-
ness of black servants, coupled with the
brandy-bottle, that gave the tropical regions
their ill-reputation. My own family was
associated with India through three genera-
tions of army service. Its members were
'mostly engaged in either hard fighting or
hard hunting; and they were all long-lived
except where the effects of war took a hand.
One of them, who had spent a long life in
India, accumulating a formidable tallat of
wounds, died at 80 from a fall from a horse
in an English hunting-field.

YOUR JUDGMENT
To forget quality first in purchasing a motor car is to run serious danger
of making a costly experiment.
Motorists everywhere know that Dodge Brothers have built for
quality from the beginning.
For example, a far greater percentage of tough and costly Chrome
Vanadium Steel is used in Dodge Brothers car than in any other. And
this gives it exceptional sturdiness.
The result is that this car is an investment in proved quality that every
Dodge Brothers owner is proud of.

What a lovely
Gift.!"
Fog.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
F0G!....
You must trust to lead and log,
While it wraps you in its blanket
all around.
In a world of grey mist vast on the bridge
you stand aghast,
While everywhere the deadened whistles
sound.
All direction seems askew as you sound your
horn anew;
With straining eyes you seek to pierce the
gloom,
And you vainly try to sort —first to star-
board, then to port,
And ahead —which whistle means your
sudden doom!
And it’s fog, fog,
While the old tank like a log
Wallows drunkenly upon a lazy swell;
And your speed is brought to “slow,” and
you really do not know
Where you’re going. There’s no knowing
In a fog—
Rotten fog,
Sent by all the devils cruising out o’ Hell!
When you’ve battled from the east you
anticipate a feast
Of good things you will get in Sydney town :
Home and wife and children, too, who will
make the most of you,
Bringing smiles upon a face that wore a
frown.
All the worries that you know and the back
rent that you owe
Seem as nothing, and your , troubles are all
dead ;
But your time at home is short, so you
curse and snarl and snort
When a peasoup bank of darkness looms
ahead!
And it’s fog, fog!
Is a man a flamin’ dog
To be kicked about by elements like these?
Your heart is all elate, but your devil lies
in wait,
And you’re hailing and you’re railing
In the fog—
Ghostly fog;
And you’re praying to your gods to send a
breeze!
When you see a form ahead, rising like a
thing long dead,
A spectre of the ocean from its grave,
You curse, but raise a laugh as you grab
the telegraph,
And you “stop her” just in time....a
narrow shave!
The great mass noses past—big of hull and
small of mast—
You spit the smother from your aching chest.
Her syren makes a sound like a knell for
seamen drowned—
And you swear to give the rotten sea-life
best!
Then it’s fog, fog,
And you creep and onward jog—
Taking soundings every minute with the lead.
And the skipper, cursing free, is a sight for
eyes to see—
Cursing loudly, cursing proudly
At the fog,
Fearsome fog:
A shroud to wrap around a sailor dead!
F0g!....
Like a horse stuck in a bog.
You are helpless when you’re waiting for a
breeze.
Rut you know the fog is done when a few
lone “catspaws” run
O’er the surface of the smooth and oily seas!
Then the breeze comes on apace, and you
sport a cheerful face
When Macquarie lighthouse looms across the
haze;
And it only seems a dream with the Hornby
light abeam.
“This life,” you say, “will do me all my
days!”
And it’s fog, fog,
Making all your senses clog—-
But you cannot drink your wine and leave
the lees!
When you’re home and feeling gay in your
cottage, Bondi-way,
Then you’re thinking: “I’m not shrinking
From the fog—
Dismal fog—
Come rough or smooth a sailor loves the
seas!”
ALBATROSS.
Discipline.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
EUTON CALTHORP felt the ground
rocking under his feet, and was sur-
prised at the tempest of wrath over-
whelming him —he who from his youth had
taught his spirit discipline. Perhaps the
ways he had travelled had not always been
the most pleasant, but they had always been
safe; his care for the feelings of others had
acted as a guard to his own life. But the
sudden shattering of a dream which seemed
so sure, as well as so sweet, found him un-
guarded ; he had been so cautious that, it
seemed, a special malevolence of Pate had
exalted his vision into the skies in order
that his feet might be tripped.
His mind went back to the morning of
his first meeting with Zonia. Always when
he thought of her she was framed in the
glory of that day. It was one of milk-
washed skies, joyful sunlight, heat intense
but pleasurable—the sort of heat that in-
vited the world to siesta. Pavements, exud-
ing the warm smell of melting tar, shim-
mered in the sun, and bubbles of pitch boiled
out of the asphalt-road surface. Calthorp,
sixty-two and in the habit of regarding him-
self as old, felt that he was not so elderly
after all; felt a spring in his gait and a
buoyancy in his breast that reminded him
of youth-—indeed, well preserved and care-
fully-dressed, he looked rather a prosperous
man of early middle-age than the oldster he
was. The day was glorious to him; but
there was an extra fineness about it as he
turned into the Gardens, where a breath of
something very like coolness struck the
cheeks occasionally, bringing the smell
of damp earth and the impression of sprink-
ling water, although the cooling sprays could
not be seen.
His training of reticence, rather than
bashfulness, would have caused him to pass
his accustomed seat had he noticed that it
had an occupant; but when, abstracted, he
arrived there, the quick action of the girl
in making way for him was so disarming
that he found himself sitting beside her and
adding to his thanks a remark about the
weather.
“Ohf it is wonderful!” she responded. “On
a day like this you glimpse the fulness of
life that is to be enjoyed, and should be en-
joyed, by everybody. But, if they could, they
would lock up this beautiful sunlight and
make profit out of selling it to us by the
pint.”
“Thank God no one can do that!” he said
devoutly. “The sunshine is free to us all.
“No, it isn’t,” she contradicted, rebel-
liousiy. “They make us pay for that, too.
In the office where I work the girls will have
to stay until the golden glory of the day is
gone, and I, because I had to come out here,
will probably lose my job.”
With that start Calthorp found himself
listening, strangely interested and strangely
pleased, to the girl whose delight at having
someone to talk to was a great deal more
evident than he allowed his own to be. He
smiled sardonically at the reflection that his
friendly confidence put him in his place.
He was an old man, a harmless old fogey, to
Avhom a girl might chatter as she liked, on
a chance acquaintance, without any sugges-
tion of a need for circumspection. He repre-
sented disciplined old age; she was youth,
crude youth, making its demands upon life
for happiness. In a very little time lie had
learned a great deal about her, and —in spite
of his long devotion to discipline, or perhaps
because of it —what he learned he liked.
She was a rebel, whose enemies were a mys-
terious “they” who put shackles upon life
and callously surrounded every precious plea-
sure with fences. She had a riotous hunger
for the good things of the world, and though
she resented the fact that in most directions
it would remain unsatisfied, that did not in
any way impair her enjoyment of those plea-
sures which came her way. She spoke to
him of dances —cheap, poor little dances —
and he found that their tawdry glories were
invested with an interest because of her zest.
References to “boys” came into lier revela-
tion, but they faded out of the narrative
for reasons never explained but obvious;
the standard of the “boys” was not on a
level with her own. Undoubtedly she was
wholesome.
He was surprised to discover the time.
“Young lady,” he said, “you have a very-
proper indignation against people who with
hold from others things they might enjoy, so I
hope you will not withhold from a lonely
old man the pleasure of taking you to lunch.
It is now nearly one.”
“What a nice way to put it!” she cried,
her eyes glistening. “I didn’t expect to have
anything to eat until I got home, but there
is a place here in the gardens, under the
trees”
He liked the frankness of her acceptance,
and, sitting in the dancing shadows and
speckled sunlight thrown by the trees, he
was inclined to join her in her enthusiasm
about the delight of the al fresco meal. It
was ages since he had so enjoyed a meal.
“I don’t want to encourage your habit
of staying away from the office,” he said,
“but possibly we might arrange for some
more of these lunches. And as you like
theatres, perhaps you will come with me to
see ‘The Honeymoon Girl’?”
“Ooh!” Her exclamation was that of one
receiving unexpected gifts. “I would have
to ask my boy; I wouldn’t like to go without
telling him. But, of course, he won’t mind.”
After that they were friends, and, in a
laughing humor at having called him that,
she named him “Uncle.” Calthorp was satis-
fied to be regarded as old and on the shelf
so long as he was allowed the companion-
ship of youth which renewed his own. He
was quite humble about it. The girl gave
him more than he could possibly give her.
Her avidness renewed his appetite for things
long grown stale; the performance, dull in
itself, was given merit by her unsophisti-
cated enjoyment. There were times when
her crudeness jarred his fastidiousness, but
as time went on he noticed the jars less.
Calthorp was not only satisfied to be re-
regarded as old; lie liked it. The gulf of
years between them would have made their
relations ridiculous on any other .basis, as he
saw it. There was no elderly foppishness
about him. If he put a buttonhole in his
coat and donned a carefully-selected new
tie for his meetings with Zonia, it was merely
that his bright “niece” should have no need
to be ashamed of her companion.
Sometimes he wished he had met such a
girl when he was younger. Such splendor
as a great love affair can give to a life he
had missed. He had early found himself
married to a woman by whom he had never
been deeply stirred. Respect for her feel-
ings had prevented any possibility of subse-
quent loose love affairs. Consideration for
others was Calthorp’s actuating principle.
Gratification and calm happiness had come
to him from a clean, well-modulated life;
but. looking back, there was something dis-
tinctly unsatisfying in the wedded life that
did not even yield a deep grief when the
companion of thirty-five years had died.
His children had grown up and married, and
had their own interests. In spite of intel-
lectual resources, he was—-but for Zonia —a
lonely man. He thought of her doctrine of
payments, which she had mentioned in
almost her first words to him, reflecting that
if he had won serenity his life had still
made its payment.
As was natural to one of Calthorp’s habit
of mind, he saw Zonia’s parents to explain

Look to Your Kidneys
Stop That Wearying Backache!
MAKE life a pleasure again. That pain in the small of
the back; that urinary disorder; that tired, nervous,
old and worn-out feeling; those headaches and dizzy
sensations ; all may be due to kidney weakness, which can be over-
come. Worrying will not help you. Get fit and well by taking
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. This medicine gives the kidneys
the strengthening help they need, and so prevents rheumatism,
sciatica, lumbago, dropsy, stone in the kidney, or inflammation of
the bladder. Although Doan’s Pills relieve even these serious
symptoms, PREVENTION is by far the wiser plan. An occasional
course of Doan’s will keep you in good health.
CONVINCING PROOF FROM
SYDNEY.
A MAN’S CASE
Mr. Frederick Bradd, Crump Street,
Mortdale, Sydney, says: “I caught a
severe cold, which settled in my kid-
neys and caused severe backache. I
suffered intense pain, and could not
stoop or move about freely. I did not
know what to do to get ease, for the
remedies I used did me no good. See-
ing an advertisement for Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills led me to try them.
They gave me relief right from the
first dose, and in a short time I was
cured. I have no sign of backache
now, and attribute mv cure solely to
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
Sixteen years later Mr. Bradd says:
“I have been free from backache since
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured
me sixteen years ago. I am still a
great believer in this medicine, and
often take a few doses, as I think the’
kidneys need a tonic sometimes.”
A WOMAN’S CASE
Mrs. F. Osmond, No. 8 Gilbert
Street, Manly, Sydney, says: “I was
a martyr to backache, and the pain at
times was almost unbearable. I also
had several other distressing symptoms
of kidney disorder, such as headaches,
dizzy feelings and sleepless nights. I
was always trying one remedy or
another, but dei’ived no benefit from
any of them. One day a friend urged
me to take a course of Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills, and this medicine
proved to .be the very thing I wanted.
There was a marked improvement after
taking the first bottle, and by the time
I had finished three bottles of the pills
I was quite cured, all sign of backache
having disappeared entirely.”
Nine years later Mrs. Osmond says:
“I am still free of backache, and kidney
trouble, and have been since Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills cured me over
nine years ago.”

SYDNEY MAN CURED OF PILES BY
DOAN’S OINTMENT.
Mr. W. Solomon, Wentworth Street, Parramatta, Sydney, says: “About
20 years ago I had a very severe attack of Itching and Bleeding Piles, and
underwent an operation. I was right for about eight years, and then the
complaint returned. The agony was terrible. Not wanting to undergo
another operation, I started using Pile remedies. The number I used would
astonish you, but they gave me no benefit whatever. I read of Doan’s
Ointment curing others, and decided to give it a trial. After a few applica-
tions I obtained relief and one pot cured me. I always keep Doan’s Ointment
in the house, and shall never be without it, for I know what a thoroughly
good remedy it is.”
Ten years later Mr. Solomon says: “I have still the same good opinion
of Doan’s Ointment. It cured me of the Piles many years ago, and I never
suffer with this complaint now.”

his adoption of his “niece.” It was an inter-
view rasping to his senses. Their greedy
hopes that their daughter had hooked a
wealthy admirer were obvious. He thought
it necessary to dissipate their ideas. Some-
where back in their lives there must have
been romance when Zonia was named, but
life had edged them to a mean sharpness.
Frankly he disliked them.
Ilis estimate of her parents only made
Zonia seem more wonderful. There was
sheer enjoyment in all their meetings. The
prospect of them gilded all the rest of iCal-
thorp’s days. And it was a real grief when
he noticed that the merriness of his friend
was clouded, and realised that a shadow
had been upon her for at least a couple of
their meetings—he had thought it but a
passing mood.
“Zonie,” he said, “something has damped
your spirits. What’s the matter? Don’t
you think an uncle might be told?”
She fell silent.
“Well, if you don’t want to tell me, I
want to cheer you up. Suppose you come
to a theatre with me to-night. Stay on
and we’ll have dinner somewhere, take a car
for a run and then the theatre.”
“Oh, yes!” she answered eagerly.
“That young man of yours won’t object?”
he quizzed.
And then he learnt that the young lover
was gone. Although it would give him more
of Zonia, he was angry; it had apparently
hurt Zonia deeply. He picked out the most
amusing of the evening’s shows, and his
heart glowed when she suddenly laughed
outright, joyously.
But thereafter he sensed a sobered Zonia,
and was distressed. His pleasure in serving
her had reached the stage when sacrifice
became a pleasure. Wanting desperately to
chase the clouds from her life, he formed a
plan on the memory of her delight in
talking of travel —of Paris, London, Naples,
Venice. He had the money and to spare.
He would miss her desperately, but in the
delight of a trip to those cities of her
dreams she would forget her sorrows. She
could take* her mother with her. Delight in
his sacrifice became an ecstasy as he pon-
dered his idea and pictured her pleasure.
But when lie made her the offer, her grave
thoughtfulness surprised him.
“No; I have taken too much. I could not
take all that money from you,” she said.
“From an old man to his niece”-
“You are not old! You are not old!”
she cried aloud passionately. “For a man
you are young.”
“Almost from the first you called me
‘Uncle.’ ”
“I was only a girl ; you have taught me
to grow up. Don’t you notice it?”
He did ; but with her resistance he wanted
now to press his sacrifice upon her. He felt
that her reluctance was only inspired by
disinclination to accept so large a gift.
“But I don’t want to go,” she said.
The subject dropped; and Calthorp only
realised that the offer had made a difference
between them when she failed to appear at
the time appointed for the next meeting. A
multitude of questioning fears fell upon him.
He realised that his young companion had
grown to occupy so large a place in his life
that he. would be desolate without her.
Yet it bore in upon his mind with a
devastating humility that he was an old man
and she only a girl—what more natural than
that the return of her lover should create
a passionate obsession which would cause
him to be forgotten, unwanted! If she did
not want him, if she had no longer use for
the pleasures he could afford her, he would
mft pursue her.
In his loneliness the desire to live once
more the pleasant hours they had spent by
walking one of their most frequented paths
led him rambling through the gardens. And
at the end of the ramble he came upon
Zonia suddenly, despondently seated on a
secluded seat.
The unexpected meeting created an earth-
quake of emotion in both. As, with a glad
<ry, he called to her, she rose in confusion,
and then, in the chaos of explanation, she
was sobbing in his arms, telling him that she
thought the suggested trip abroad meant
that he was tired of her friendship and
wanted to get rid of her. Obsessed with
this idea, she had decided not to intrude
upon him: but, just as his steps had been
led along the path, so had she come here to
review old memories.
Sweetly amazing as the revelation was,
Calthorp fought against it. The union of
youth with age, he gravely argued, was un-
natural ; it was a crime to youth which he
shrank from committing.
Now this dream that had been so wonder-
fully sweet was abruptly shattered, he re-
called how he had resisted being flattered
into what he had always regarded as folly, and.
keen joy as it was to him. had only yielded
to what seemed indisputable evidence that
the marriage would make Zonia happy.
Fate had duped him maliciously. The
joy of their brief married life had lulled
lnm into a secure feeling that the marriage
was an act not of folly but of wisdom: and
then, entering the house one day, he all but
intruded upon the scene which destroyed the
foundations of his happiness.
Not daring to trust himself with the shock
fresh upon him. he did not obey his first
impulse to dash in upon Zonia and her lover,
but withdrew hastily, before they had seen
him, to fight with his anger. He had been a
fool, of course; but it was Zonia who had
made him one, against his better judgment.
Soon, very soon, the angry thoughts gave
way to a dull hopelessness; and he felt an
old man again, the weight of years restored
to his shoulders and dragging more heavily
than ever they had. In his well regulated
mind order restored itself. It was futile to
blame Zonia; she was a creature of young,
crude impulses, and his was the folly in
allowing his matured judgment to be set
aside. How could he throw the responsibility
upon her? He had held out a golden bait to
her and by that had encouraged her to trick-
ery. He had known well enough that young
blood would call to young blood, and that
discipline was not the lode-star of the rebel-
lious girl he had met on a sunny day in the
Gardens.
His appearance, calm and grave, startled
Zonia and the young man. They were seated
apart now; but a look of guilt was in their
faces.
“I want to speak to you—-to both of you,”
he said as the young man rose. “I may say
that, coming in a while ago, I heard—and
saw—you.”
“Elton!” cried Zouia, her face flaming. He
blessed those blushes; there was at least
honesty in their confession.
He was calmly judicial, and he spoke down
Zonia’s protests. He exonerated her from
blame; the wedding of age and youth was a
mistake for which lie took responsibility. It
was for him to rectify the mistake; his care
w r as Zonia’s happiness. But they would have
to wait. Pie would put it in Zonia’s way to
secure a divorce. “And I will also provide
her with some money—the money that
tempted her to her deception.”
He could not help a tone of bitterness.
Zonia cried out incoherently against it.
“Yes ; an old man who marries a girl in-
vites trouble,” said the young man. “It isn’t
natural.”
“Will you go!” Zonia flared at him furi-
ously. He seemed to shrink out before her.
Calthorp watched him go. He had ex-
plained the situation and now he felt dazed.
He turned towards the door, but found, sud-
denly, that Zonia, her eyes flooded with tears,
was standing before him pouring out words.
“I did love him, but he did not want to
marry me,” he heard her say. “When he
heard I was married he came here; and his
coming took me by surprise. I”
“I will not stand in your way,” he said.
“I have wronged you all the way through,
and I will supply you with at least the evi-
dence for a divorce. Then”
“You will not, Elton !” she cried passion-
ately. “Don’t you realise that, living with
you, I have changed? I am no longer the
crude girl you first met; I know that life
means restraints as well as impulses. Don’t
you see the change in me?”
“Yes, you have changed,” he said. “But
what has that to do with it? You love this
young man”
“I don’t!” she cried. “I have grown to
love something finer than youthful selfishness.
I have been learning, and how could I have
any consideration now for a man who would
shamefully make love to a woman, the wife
of another man, whom he would not marry
when he could? How can I compare a cheap
creature like that with my husband!”
Calthorp’s brain cleared. The light of a
very clear adoration was in her eyes. The
weight of years suddenly dropped from his
shoulders.
HAMER.
“Brumby.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was Brumby that introduced me to
Micky. 110 was the ugliest-looking dog
that ever followed a traveller, though he
didn’t seem to be out of place following
Micky Rcon.
In his best day and completest form he
was not an animal that anyone would want
to steal; and Micky had shorn him of the
few adornments lie had possessed and made
him an object of ridicule. Yet Micky would
sooner have lost his swag than have lost
Brumby. As he sometimes remarked, they
were “bound together by the ties of remem-
brance.” Besides being a good and faithful
servant on the track, lie had once saved
Micky’s life.
“It was this way,” said Micky, gazing at
the mongrel that was partly missing. “We
got caught by a sudden flood on the Bulloo,
an' were marooned on a island. The tucker-
bags was empty, and there wasn’t enough
herbage to keep a grasshopper. An’ there
wasn't any hope of bein’ seen by a chance
traveller either, the knob bein’ surrounded
by miles of water. Only , ants an’ beetles an’
that sort of thing came ashore. Nothing
that would take the edge off a appetite.
“Things got pretty desperate, an’ the
weather wasn’t promisin’ anything better.
So I put it to Brumby that something would
have to be done. There was no sense in
lookin’ at one another starvin’ to death. He
seemed to be of the same opinion, though
lie wasn’t complainin’. He’d sit an’ look
across the water as if he was studyin’ emigra-
tion problems; an’ then he’d look at me
as if he loved me so much that he could eat
me.
“After ponderin’ for days over ways an’
means, I see. there was only one way an’
one means. I reckoned Brumby could get
along as well without his tail as with it.
So I chopped it off with the tomahawk, made
a pot of soup with it and give him the bones.
He seemed sore, but grateful.
“Well, that pulled us along a bit, but not
far. There was no improvement in the sur-
roundings. an’ still nothing but beetles cornin’
ashore. So I put it to Brumby that there
would have to be another sacrifice. He had
floppy ears, which seemed to be a nuisance
to him, and a impediment to his hearin’.”
Micky paused a moment, and looked again
at his canine mate, who seemed to under-
stand that he was the subject of interest.
“I took one off at a time, an’ shared them
with him,” Micky resumed. “They weren’t
much better’n a bit of old hide; but Brumby
seemed to enjoy them. Still, he didn’t appear
shook on the idea that he had to eat him-
self to keep alive.
“A day or two afterwards I was con-
siderin’ what else he might be able to spare
at a pinch, as he wanted a feed pretty badly
himself. He wasn’t hangin’ about me as
close as he used to, an’ appeared to have
lost confidence in me as a provider. He
wouldn’t come to be patted, but sat down
some yards away an’ barked at me. If he
saw me with the tomahawk or the butcher’s
knife, he slunk off to the end of the island
as if he was meditatin’ a sea v’yage.
“And then the water began to fall, an’
just when it was a toss up whether he’d eat
me or I’d eat him we managed to get off.
Brumby followed a long way behind, like a
strange dog that wanted to be adopted an’
wasn’t sure of the reception he’d get. But
when he saw me makin’ a spread of damper
an’ beef he come up an’ made friends.
“He was that pleased he’s been tryin’ to
wag himself ever since.”
